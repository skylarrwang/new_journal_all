base, or my speaking out on con trover· 
sial issues. So it's wrong to say that an 
exciting university which alienates 
some alumni is going to lose more than 
it gains. 

TNJ: In terms of a dollar amount, 
that's what happened in that period. 
Brewster: No. 

TNJ: The facts I've seen 
Brewster: You could tell preliminary 
facts about cause and effect; that is, to 
say that the alumni fund kept going up 
anyway. But to say that bequests or 
major gifts declined, that's very hard to 
attribute to particular policies in the 
context of the onset of inflation and 
recession. 

TNJ: In the early '70s the percentage 
went back up again, rather dramatical-
ly, from 14- per cent to 20 per cent. Did 
concern for alumni fund contributions 
play a role in that increase? 
Brewster: No, I don't think it was 
alumni fund contributions. I think it 
was the fact that Worth David, with 
the admissions committee of the facul-
ty and the admissions committee of the 
corporation, was aware of the fact that 
alumni at least deserved to be looked at 
twice. I think that it was in part a con-
sequence of trying to overcome the in-
sensitivity that lnslee had shown by 
seeming to not give a damn at all about 
alumni relationships. We had always 
felt that, other things being equal, the 
alumni sons or daughters should be 
preferred. And I think that's still prob-
ably so. 

TNJ: I'd like to hear more about your 
book. 
Brewster: One of the sources of my in-
terests was an awareness of the impor-
tance of enabhng society to invest in 
the education of its oncoming genera-
tion. It occurred to me that this was 
probably going to outpace available

resources, at least outpace state tax 
systems, state universities and private 
contributions. When I was in England, 
I had a chance to give lectures. One 
was on the politics of supporting the 
arts and one was on how to support 
health care. A couple of others dealt 
with my ideas on better and worse 
ways of government support of educa-
tion. And I became aware of the fact 
that conservatives don't pay enough at-
tention to the importance to a free 
society of being sure that people's 
capacity 
is 
not underdeveloped, 
whether in terms of health, education, 
creative ability, minimal standards of 
living, housing and so on. But it's also 
true that liberals, or progressives, can 
underestimate the danger of having a 
citizen rely on favors from the state. 
Therefore the question is how to devise 
techniques which don't abdicate the 
responsibility of the state for develop-
ing the citizen's capacity and don't 
make the citizen a dependent ward of 
the state. I don't think there's a single 
answer, but I think that there are a 
variety of answers in different fields. 

TNJ: In education, what are some of 
these answers? 
option is preferable either to grants nr 
loans. We decided to use it becauc;e we 
thought if we could demonstrate what 
its potential was and what its bugs 
were, perhaps the federal government 
would make it possible for all institu-
tions, at least at the graduate level. 
Tuition postponement would allow the 
student to get an advance for the cost 
of his education and spend that ad-
vance if he undertook an obligation to 
pay it back through the tax system. 
This would mean that the government 
wouldn't have to deal either with the 
student or with the institution. The 
student in effect would be able to invest 
in his own education and only have to 
pay it back in proportion to his income 
for as long a period as was necessary. 
And I still think it's a far better system 
than either a kind of means test ad-
ministered by the government or hav-
ing the government make grants either 
to individuals of institutions, which in 
effect creates an artificial market. This 
is simply illustrative of the search for 
devices which 
take 
advantage of 
market mechanisms but which would 
still permit the government to see to it 
that no one was excluded from the op-
portunity to get the education that he 
had the motivation for and had the 
talent for. 

TNJ: What are you going to do after 
you finish your book? 


Brewster: I enjoy the work I'm doing 
in the law firm. Whether I would ever 
want to take that up full time, it's too 
early to say. 

TNJ: Do you have political ambitions? 
Brewster: No, definitely not. 

TNJ: You've been denying that for 15 
years. 
Brewster: Also never got to it! 

TNJ: Yes, that's true. 
Brewster: With each passing year it 
becomes more convincing. There 
aren't all that many left. But, no, I 
have an increasing interest in public 
affairs, obviously bound to after the 
last four years particularly, but also the 
years that went before. But I think 
politics is a profession and the notion 
that you can come into politics from 
the outside and be effective is quite 
ridiculous. 

TNJ: If not politics, what then? 
Brewster: The practice of law is not a 
bad solution. Or maybe I'll write 
another book. I've got to prove I can 
write one book first. I have not on the 
• whole planned ahead very much. 
Everything I've done has come to me 
as a great surprise and I've been-
knock on wood -lucky enough with 
each one of those opportUnities.
