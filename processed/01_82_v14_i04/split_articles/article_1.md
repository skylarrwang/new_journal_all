**Title: About this Issue**
**Author: The New Journal**
**Page number(s): 3**

Since our masthead lists many new 
names this issue, we decided to 
explain what it all means. 

The people listed as friends 
contributed money or time to The 
New Journal and we wanted to give 
them special recognition and thanks. 
For example, Nicholas X. Rizopoulos 
('58) has been an ally of The New 
Journal since 1967, and has most 
recently provided useful advice and 
helped us raise funds. Peter B. 
Cooper ('64 Law) is a New Haven 
lawyer who handles our legal affairs 
free of charge. 

Heidi Callison and Matthew 
Gaynor have been elected as the 
magazine's new designers. Both are 
senior Art majors concentrating in 
graphic design. They designed much 
of our December issue and are 
responsible for the changes in this 
issue. 

We've also elected several new Staff 
members. People are eligible for Staff 
after they have worked on a variety 
of aspects of the magazine for two 
issues. This brief trial period gives 
people a chance to see what we're all 
about before making a commitment. 
It also gives them a sense of exactly 
what's involved in publishing a 
magazine. 

There is a great deal involved, and 
we are constantly looking for 
creative, aggressive people to work 
with us. We're especially looking for 
experienced photographers and 
people with a background or interest 
in business. If you are interested, call 
Photography Editor, Rollin Riggs at 
432-0470, or Business Manager, Jeff 
Foster at 432-0050.
