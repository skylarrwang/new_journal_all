It is several weeks before the collegiate hockey season is to begin, and Yale's head hockey coach Tim Taylor sits in the empty bleachers of Ingalls Rink talking with a visitor. Taylor maintains a strict rule against being late for practice and now, though he is trying to be polite and entertain his guest, he checks his watch frequently. 
"Have you seen Hoc/cey Magazine's preseason predictions?" the visitor asks. 
"No, I don't think I have," Taylor responds. 
"They don't say much about us." 
"Good." 
"That's the way you like it huh?"

"Yeah, we'll just have to sneak up on them," Taylor says, staring straight ahead. 


A born-again Yale hockey program has been sneaking up on "them" for quite awhile now-since 1976 to be exact. That was the year Timothy B. Taylor, a Harvard man, left Cambridge to begin a reclamation project that makes other efforts to rebuild teams look like an afternoon with Tinker Toys. The real task set before Taylor nearly six years ago is completed. No longer does the Yale hockey team begin a season with nothing more to look forward to than the possibility of securing victories against the few inferior teams on its schedule, and the slim hope of stealing a win or two from superior foes. No longer do Yale hockey players take recruits aside and encourage them to go elsewhere. No, those days are gone. 


It does not matter, really, that Taylor-coached teams have lost more games than they've won, or that they've never emerged victorious from an ECAC playoff contest (they've only been in one). What is important is that Taylor has given respectability to a program that had wallowed in mediocrity for more than a decade. In 1976, Taylor inherited a team that had won just five of its previous 48 outings, and in the 11 years prior to his arrival had averaged nearly 17 losses a season. This season, for the first time since the Ivy League was formally organized in 1955, Yale is defending an Ivy title in hockey. 
"You know, where I'm from it's unheard of for Yale to be defending Ivy champs," said assistant coach Mike Gilligan, a Boston native who came to Yale this season after leading Salem State to six straight ECAC Division II playoff berths. "Yale is beginning to attract some of the premier players it needs to remain a perennial contender. As some of the younger players develop they'll give us the depth we need to emerge as one of the better teams in the East, and maybe in the country." 


About Yale hockey's extraordinary progress under his guidance, Taylor will only say that each season the team re-evaluates its goals and that his personal aim is to make the Elis "as competitive as possible." Taylor exudes confidence, but he does it quietly with a calm, firm resolve. That same purposefulness was in his voice when he came to Yale as a tall and slender, boyish looking man of 34. He greeted the local press and Yale alumni with determined statements: "I intend to turn things around right away in terms of attitude and desire to win" ... "I plan to devote every moment to the Yale hockey program" ... "I'm going to teach a system" ... "I wouldn't have come here if I didn't think I could do the job ... " 
I wouldn't have come here if I didn't think I could do the job. As a senior at Harvard he captained a Crimson team that rolled to a 21-3-2 record on its way to the ECAC championship. In six seasons as Harvard's freshman coach, Taylor's teams compiled a 79-28-1 mark. Why, then did he leave? 
"I did a lot of soul-searching," Taylor said. "I had to resolve in my own mind that I wanted to be a head coach. I figured Yale would be a good place to launch a career." 
"I realized there were two things I had to do to turn this program around," he said recently. "First, we (Taylor and then-assistant coach Ben Smith) had to instill a feeling of winning. We had to get the players thinking positively. We were able to do that, I think, even in our first season when we were still losing most of our games. The players weren't down at Rudy's getting stiff and talking about what a jerk I was. They weren't making excuses about why they were losing. They were beginning to take pride in their program. 
"Second, we had to recruit. We simply had to get more Division I players on our roster. We've spent countless hours recruiting." 


I plan to devote every moment to the Yale hockey program. The son of a wealthy newspaper publisher, Taylor could have devoted himself to learning Daddy's business. He even looks more like an executive than a rink rat; that is, until you notice the faded crescent scar slicing across his chin. 
But dedicate himself Taylor has done. He is intense, by his own admission, sometimes too intense. Never one to picture himself as a nine-to-five businessman type, Taylor begins each day during the season shortly after 8:00a.m. and usually ends it about 14 hours later by watching game films either in his cramped office at Ingalls Rink, or at home where he has a video-tape player attached to his television. 
As a consequence, Taylor's wife, Amy, watches a lot of hockey too. "There isn't any other channel to turn to," she said. 


Perhaps as a result of his self-imposed frenetic schedule, Taylor is no longer boyish looking. A generous curl of hair still tumbles across his forehead, but most of it is grey now. Taylor, it seems, has matured as perceptibly as his hockey program. 
I'm going to teach a system. Taylor coaches a style of hockey that rejects the traditional National Hockey League mentality of dumping the puck into the corners and chasing it. Instead, Taylor emphasizes aggressive forechecking, puck control, and motion. It's great hockey when executed properly, but it's a difficult style to perfect, especially for college teams whose personnel changes radically from year to year. As a result, and this is perhaps the most frequently heard criticism of Taylor's teams, the Elis lack consistency. One night they'll simply dazzle an opponent, the next night they'll look like stumble-bums. 


Taylor's "system" is unique and relatively complex, at least at the collegiate level. He is able to teach it because he is, in the words of one Yale player, "a consummate student of the game of hockey." In the spring of 1981, Taylor served as an assistant coach for Team USA in the World Hockey Championships; last fall he was selected to a six-man observation team of the International Ice Hockey Federation at the Canada Cup Series. 
It is no coincidence that Taylor's coaching tenets have been influenced by the European brand of hockey. 
"To a certain extent, I think our style of play reflects what Tim has learned from watching and studying the Europeans," said sophomore forward Dave Williams. "We tend to set up our offense from behind the net more than our opponents. We also use what you might call "situational plays" and we adjust them depending on the rink we're playing in or the team we're facing." 


I don't intend to end up at the bottom of the Ivy League. Yale won its first game under Taylor, a good omen but not a particularly meaningful one. Taylor's Elis went on to garner six more victories that first season, three of them against a hapless Pennsylvania team. Little more than a year later Penn officials axed the hockey program, reasoning perhaps, that if the Quakers couldn't beat Yale they didn't belong. 
"That first season was hell at times," said Smith, who is now an assistant coach at Boston University. "I can remember being in tears after one game up at Dartmouth. We got clobbered that night and I just sat in the locker room wondering when we were ever going to be able to beat those guys." 


Under Taylor, the Yale players may have begun to feel like winners, but they still weren't winning. Neither Taylor's sophisticated coaching philosophy nor his unflagging dedication prevented the Elis from enduring yet another dismal, frustrating season. Instead, that first season simply proved a popular coaching adage, namely, that "you can't make chicken salad out of chicken shit." 


We had to recruit. Recruiting is a naughty concept within some Ivy League circles. In his speech to an alumni convocation in April of 1980, Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti recommended that the league "discuss restricting recruiting by coaches to on-campus conversations and visits . . . I believe it is demeaning to the profession of coaching when one has to spend so much time traveling and wooing off campus." 
Taylor has spoken out sharply against Giamatti's speech. "Recruiting is absolutely necessary," he said. "Many athletes from lower and middle income families look at Yale as an elitist institution. Usually they don't even associate athletics with Yale. We have to show these kids what Yale has to offer both educationally and athletically. The top athletes wouldn't be here unless they were recruited." 


Ironically, it was the Yale administration, by allowing Taylor to hire Smith as a full-time assistant, that provided Taylor the freedom to recruit ambitiously. He now has two full-time assistants, but Yale didn't even have a full-time haul coach from 1965 to 1972. 
Giamatti may want excellence in athletics, as he frequently professes, but Yale would have never achieved it-at least in hockey-without successful recruiting. 


Taylor, who admits that it's relatively easy to sell Yale to a prospective student once you get him on campus, delegates most of the on-the-road recruiting to his assistants. These trips result in frequent long-distance telephone conversations between coaches to evaluate which players might be interested in Yale and, more importantly, which players the admissions office might be willing to accept. 
In December, assistant Bob Richardson made a scouting trip to Minnesota. As he filed out several reports, Taylor perused a long, detailed grocery list of high school talent. Taylor and Richardson briefly discussed each player: "I think we can kiss him good-bye ... Well, Eddie Kilroy says he's good ... Can he play ... Logan? ... Vino? ... You know, Richard Vino. Can he play? ... I called Logan the other night ... I think you've got to get in to the household of that kid ... Well, I heard that guy had a visit at Cornell and he said that he didn't want to go to a school where he had to study hard. He said he just wanted to concentrate on hockey. I don't think he's our style ... That kid seems pretty naive ... I know he did well on his SAT's ... does he have the speed? ... I know he's not pretty looking yet but he'll come along ... " 


Last season's graduating class was Taylor's first crop of recruits. In four years they compiled two winning records (13-12-1 in 1978-79 and 14-12-1 last season), upset an unbeaten Boston University squad that went on to win the national championship, lost to Harvard just once in eight meetings, and earned an ECAC playoff berth, Yale's first since 1967. 


It was the loss of 10 seniors from that class which lulled most people into believing that this would be another rebuilding year for Taylor. Instead of rebuilding, however, Taylor reloaded. 
"That we lost 10 seniors was kind of a misleading statistic but I didn't tell any people otherwise before the season began," Taylor said. "Two of those seniors were not regular starters, two others missed most of the season with injuries, and another had kind of an off year. We figured we would be able to replace them." 
"Our concern," said Gilligan, "was whether we'd be able to handle the added pressure of being defending Ivy champs. We knew everybody would be gunning for us." 


The Elis have responded with a capable arsenal. Captain Dan Poliziani and junior Bob Brooke, considered two of the best players in college hockey, and senior Joe Gagliardi, Yale's top goal scorer a year ago, provide an offensive attack perhaps unparalleled in Yale history. 
Meanwhile, freshman Peter Sawkins, a seventh-round draft pick of the Los Angeles Kings in June and the latest of Taylor's prized recruits, had combined with sophomore goalies Paul Tortorella and juniors Bill Nichols and Dave Tewksbury to bolster a once porous defense. 
Tortorella allowed just 10 goals in Yale's first four ECAC games, and he played spectacularly in the Elis' first loss of the season, a 1-0 heartbreaker against a perennially tough Boston University team. That loss, probably more than any of their wins, demonstrated how far the Yale hockey program has come in five years-and how far it still has to go. 
"I don't think we've seen a team that we can't beat," Taylor said, after the B.U. game. "But then again, no one is afraid of us either. Realistically, we're not a Division I powerhouse yet. We're a good team. Sometimes, a pretty darn good team."
