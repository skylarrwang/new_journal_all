programs, such as 60 
Minutes. 
dogmatic teaching of Judeo-Christian 
faith in the schools, Thomas said. "But 
when we say we're not going to allow 
that, we must also say that we're not 
going to allow the humanist philosophy 
- that you evolved from a primordial 
ooze, and then later descended from 
monkeys- to the exclusion of any 
other viewpoint, [or] that you can take 
God's name in vain but not in worship 
in the schools, [or] that we will invite 
every group including the homosexuals 
into the schools to promote their 
lifestyles, but no other person to say 
that's morally wrong. While we would 
certainly oppose any sectarian imposi-
tion through public law of a particular 
religious faith, including the Christian 
faith, we must say that discrimination 
and intolerance cut both ways." 


Lloenalng bigotry? 
In his address, Giamatti accused the 
Moral Majority of licensing "a new 
meanness of spirit in our land, a 
resurgent bigotry that manifests itself 
in racist and discriminatory postures." 
The President wrote that the Moral 
Majority is "of the same spirit" as the 
Ku Klux Klan, anti-semitic organiza-
tions, and other terrorist groups. The 
problem posed by Giamatti's statement 
here was how to interpret it. When he 
said "licensing bigotry," did he mean 
"condoning" or "accepting" or 
something closer to "encouraging" or 
"assisting?" To complicate matters 
even further, Giamatti provided no 
evidence to support any kind of ·con-
nection between the Moral Majority 
and the KKK. 


Thomas said Giamatti associated the 
Moral Majority with the KKK to at-
tract media attention. "I think he is 
using the phrase 'Moral Majority' to 
cover a broad range of what he regards 
as political sins," said Thomas. "Ob-
viously, he is including under that ban-
ner Nazis and the Klan, which he men-
tioned, and every other perversion he 
can think of. I think this is intellectual-
ly indefensible. He certainly knows the 
difference, being an educated man, 
between the Ku Klux Klan and the 
Moral Majority, a hate group and an 
organization which is trying to pro-
mote principles that are of interest to 
whites, blacks, jews, gentiles and 
every other kind of faith and ethnic 
group in this country. So I have to 
think that his charge was deliberate. 
Now, as for what his motivations were 
for it, you'll have to ask him. But I cer-
tainly think they were political." 


The Moral Majority is officially a 
pro-Israel and pro-Civil Rights 
organization, Thomas pointed out. He 
took pleasure: in showing his growing 
pile of "hate mail" from members of the 
KKK and the American Nazi Party 
accusing the Moral Majority of being 
"damn nigger lovers" and a "jew lover" 
organization. "We get it from both 
sides, you see," said Thomas. 


Giamatti argued that he had never 
accused the Moral Majority of racism 
or anti-Semitism, but believed the 
organjzation uses the same unqualified 
language and unquestioning rationale 
that the KKK and the Nazis use. "I 
never said in the speech that the Moral 
Majority was the Ku Klux Klan . . . If 
people want tQ take hard positions that 
say 'I'm right and you're wrong,' or 'I 
. 
~ ~ 
am t1le only one who has captured the 
truth'- that's entirely their right under 
the Consititution. But people who do 
that give other people who hold c;ven 
crazier views a sense that it is O.K." 


•nd•ngered plur•llam? 
Both Giamatti and Thomas talked at 
grea,t length about the concepts of 
pluratism, but differed on how to 
define and apply it to American socie-
ty. While Giamatti adamantly con-
demned the Moral Majority for 
threatening the ideal of pluralism, 
Thomas credited his organization for 
encouraging it. "'f anything, the Moral 
Majority is only furthering the ideal of 
pluralism by mobilizing previously in-
active people," said Thomas. 


"Pluralism," said Giamatti in his of-
fice, "is simply the sense that the 
strength of the society derives from the 
capacity of people of various back-
grounds and beliefs of all kinds to ex-
press them freely and to have the right 
of that expression protected." In his 
speech he wrote, "Pluralism does not 
abide absolutism, decree and complete 
moral certitude." 


Thomas differed: "Pluralism has: 
been redefined by the political liberals 
to mean there is no truth. That's not 
what 'pluralism' 
means. 'Pluralism 
means allowing the widest possible

participation in a debate, political or 
whatever it is. But then, somebody has 
to make a decision. 
"And we're not talking about pro-
fessors standing up in class and saying, 
'You must accept Christ or Buddha or 
Mohammad as your personal savior or 
your religious symbol.' We are talking 
about- and this is where we think the 
major institutions have failed- the 
philosophical truth that there is such a 
thing as truth." 


Giamatti countered, "Cal Thomas 
has every right to his opinion-and his , 
expression of his opinion is all part of a I 
pluralistic society. But I think that 
when you get somebody asserting that 
some people are evil and are doing the 
work of Satan, that that is not en-
couraging open debate. It depends en-
tirely upon how seriously you talk 
about Satan and evil." 


The aeoul•r unlveralt~ 
• Like many evangelicals of the Bible 
Belt, Thomas is suspicious of the ideal 
of liberal inquiry embraced by the 
country's 
universities, 
and largely 
blames educators for the nation's moral 
decline. According to Thomas, the 
universities and colleges have adopted 
the "religion" of secular humanism to 
the exclusion of all other doctrines and 
have purposefully 
promoted 
a 
valueless philos9phy that scorns the 
traditional mores of family sanctity, 
public decency, ethical living and the 
tenets of Judeo-Christian faith. 


"In our opinion," said Thomas, 
"many of the professors in these institu-
tions are filling the minds of students 
with certain 'facts' rooted in secular 
humanism. When you put young peo-
ple in a classroom where they are told 
certain 'truths' day after day by a pro-
fessor, who is their leader for that par-
ticular time, and who expects certain 
responses on the test papers or disser-
tations, they will reform their thinkin.g. 
It is a kind of programming almost." 


Giamatti was puzzled by Thomas' 
embracive term 'secular humanism.' "I 
don't know what it means. When peo-
ple tell me that secular humanism is a 
new and particularly virulent evil- my 
problem with that is not that I don't 
believe there are things that are evil, 
but that it doesn't make any sense as a 
term.

plenty of sense to me as a term because 
it is historically identifiable. It's a 
grand code word that these people use. 
"But this kind of interest in designer 
labels," continued the President, "this 
kind of Sassooning, th.is Gloria Van-
derbuting of our time -I don't hap-
pen to believe in designer labels 
regardless of where the designer comes 
from." 


Labels or no labels, Thomas was 
convinced that the nation's universities 
have drifted from their original values. 
"The fact is, of course, that Yale 
University was founded upon solid 
Judea-Christian principles, as were 
Harvard, Princeton and Dartmouth. 
Today these institutions may teach 
their students how to function well in 
society in terms of how to make a liv-
ing, but that's the 
bottom line. 
However, if it is viewed that men and 
women are in their totality more than 
how much money they make or their 
position in society, that there is a 
spiritual or moral side to them, then it 
seems incumbent upon such institu-
tions to teach students not only how to 
make a living, but also how to live." 


When Thomas condemns the "secular 
humanists" for the corruption of our 
God-fearing republic, 
and when 
Giamatti roars at the "peddlers of coer-
cion" who are out there tinkering with 
the ideals of education, they are only 
exchanging broadsides and accusations 
in the kind of rhetorical war that only 
leads to stalemate. As in too many 
debates, neither side is making much 
of an effort to understand the other 
point of view. Perhaps Giamarti was 
right when he said that the Political 
Union debate with Falwell would "go 
nowhere," just as the classic "monkey 
trial" debate 
between Brady and 
Drummond went nowhere in Jerome 
Lawrence's famous 1955 play, Inherit 
the Wind: 
Brady: I'll tell you whaJ he's trying to do.' 
He wants to destroy everybody's be/Uf in the 
Bible, and in God.' 
Drummond: You know that's not true. 
I'm trying to stop you bigots and ignoramuses 
from controlling the education of the United 
St.aJes.l And you know it.' 
And so the debate will continue.
