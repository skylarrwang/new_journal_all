The paradox of · 
working women 
Geoff Hayward 
Dr. Faye Crosby, Assistant Professor 
of Psychology at Yale, is confronting a 
paradox. 

Studies show that today's working 
woman faces persistent and often overt 
sex discrimination. A survey con-
ducted in 1978 by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor revealed that white 
females who work year round, full-
time earn just over 59 per cent of the 
salaries of full-time working men. 
Even after adjustments are made for 
differences in education and years ex-
perience, the bottom line remains the 
same: women are pa,id much less than 
men for doing the same work. 

But studies also show that the 
average working woman is content 
with her situation; she will have no 
more complaints than the average 
man. The paradox becomes all the 
more perplexing when one realizes that 
the women who are the worst off are 
generally the most content. Crosby's 
study supports others in showing that 
the 
average telephone operator, 
secretary or bar and grill waitress 
doesn't believe that sex discrimination 
has anything to do with her. The only 
women who are really angry about 
discrimination are 
those 
in high 
prestige occupations- those who, one 
might think, have the least to complain 
about. 

Even more surprising is that 
although almost all women are con-
cerned about sex discrimination in 
general, almost none will admit that 
they themselves have been its victims. 
"It is as though," observed Crosby, 
"every woman considered herself to be 
the exception to the rule of sex 
discrimination." Why do women who 
are fully conscious of sex discrimina-
tion remain so blind to its impact on 
their day to day lives? 

In 
1976, 
Faye Crosby began 
research to investigate this question. In 
a book to be published this summer by 
Oxford University Press, she tells the 
story of her research and presents her 
findings- findings which were often 
just as surprising to her as to anyone 
else. 

Crosby's inquiry was guided by a 
contemporary theory of psychology 
called relative deprivation. The theory 
works from the premise that a person's 
feelings of satisfaction or discontent 
have very little to do with his or her ac-
tual fortunes. Most theorists agree that 
to feel truly unhappy with one's present 
situation one must both want 
something better and feel that one 
deserves something better. The theorists 
claim that we gauge what we want and 
what we feel we deserve by comparing 
ourselves to people in our social group. 
As we change social groups we gain 
new expectations. "Often," explains 
Crosby, "this means that actual gains 
are accompanied by psychological 
losses." 

Crosby devised a scheme which 
would test relative deprivation theory. 
She selected 400 white men and 
women between the ages of 25 and 40; 
all were living in Newton, a suburb of 
Boston. Newton is unusual as a suburb 
because of its affiuence and was chosen 
largely because it offers such a high 
density of professionals. 

The questions asked in the inter- ~ 
views focused on the grievances of the 
workers. How often, for example, had 
they felt some sense of grievance con-
cerning their pay, working hours, or 
job responsibilities? Workers were 
asked to compare themselves to their 
co-workers. "In view of your training 
and abilities," one question read, "is 
your present job as good as it ought to 
be?" 

Plndlnga 
The answers revealed some unex-
pected reversals in public opinion. A 
study conducted in 1967, just a decade 
before Crosby's study, showed three 
per cent of the people questioned felt 
that sex discrimination was a problem 
in America. In Crosby's study, 97 per 
cent of the men and women inter-
viewed felt that sex discrimination was 
a problem. The message from New-
tonites was clear: women deserve the 
same pay for the same work. Yet this 
was not the case. 

Crosby compared a group of men 
who had prestigious jobs to a group of 
women having jobs of high prestige 
(the "prestige" of an occupation is • 
established using NORC, an accepted 
standard based on public opinion).

Although the women were on average 
slightly better educated and had on 
average slightly more prestigious oc-
cupations than the men, the men were 
being paid roughly $10,000 more per 
annum than the women. Objectively, 
this sounds like a clear case of sex 
discrimination, yet the women involv-
ed had few complaints. 

"The working women in our study," 
observed Crosby, "are aware of and 
upset about 
the extent of sex 
discrimination which faces most 
women on the job. Yet they appear 
quite naive about the extent of sex 
discrimination they themselves must 
overcome." Of the 163 women Crosby 
Psychology professor Faye Crosby 
surveyed, only five expressed strong 
personal grievances about sex dis-
crimination. 

The most obvious reason for this ap-
parent lack of concern is offered by 
relative deprivation theory: women see 
little gap betwen their actual and 
desired job rewards. In fact, among 
those with high prestige occupations, 
only seven per cent mentioned money 
as a gratifying aspect of their jobs. On 
the other hand, 50 per cent listed ac-
complishment, and 42 per cent listed 
interpersonal relations as the most im-
portant aspects of their jobs. Crosby 
suggests that many women may accept 
lower paying jobs in exchange for a

greater sense of accomplishment. 

The findings roughly confirm this 
relative deprivation theory. Most 
women did not want any more from 
their jobs than they were already get-
ting, and most women did not feel that 
they, as individuals, deserved any bet-
ter. 

However, 
relative deprivation 
theory fails to uncover the source of 
this apathy. Crosby suspected deeper 
factors were at work. 

Solving the puzzle 
In a follow-up study, she took a group 
of the most aggrieved women and com-
pared them to a group of the least ag-
grieved. "What," she asked, "prevents 
a woman from recognizing herself as a 
victim of an injustice she knows to ex-
ist?" Her study suggests there are 
psychological barriers: "The step from 
knowledge of the group situation to an 
understanding of one's own situation, 
which is a small step logically can 
become a 
chasm 
psychologically." 

Crosby made three important observa-
tions which help explain the nature of 
these psychological barriers. 

Our feelings of justice, like our feel-
ings of need, are determined by com-
paring ourselves to others, Crosby 
said. So while women compare them-
selves as a group to other groups in 
American society and conclude they 
are victims of discrimination, an in-
dividual woman will normally com-
pare herself to other members of her 
own group (i.e. other women). She 
concludes that she is treated no dif-
ferently than anyone else, and the true 
nature of the discrimination eludes 
her. In fact, among the women most 
content with their jobs, all but 21 per 
cent compared themselves with other 
women. Among the most discon-
tented, 
60 per cent compared 
themselves first of all to men. 

Crosby also noted that "individual 
suffering, unlike group suffering, ap-
pears to call for individual villains." 
When a person realizes he is suffering, 
sub-consciously he looks for someone 
to blame, someone who has intention-
ally done him harm. "Logic," Crosby 
observed, "permits us to recognize 
cases in which one individual suffers 
through the fault of no person or per-

Crosby asked,

knows to exist?" 
sons-not even himself; but psycho-
logic yearns for primitive symmetry." 

By recognizing that she has been un-
fairly treated, a woman runs the risk of 
perceiving her colleagues as enemies. 
Rather than admit that she has been 
stabbed by one or more of her peers, a 
woman will often deny that she is 
bleec;Jing. 

This fear of conflict has another 
aspect which gives rise to Crosby's 
third o~servation. By defining herself 
as a victim, a women invites denigra-
tion. Social groups in general have lit· 
tle sympathy for ·the underdog; we 
would rather blame the individual for 
his suffering than blame ourselves or 
our group. 

"The typical working 
woman," Crosby pointed out, "may see 
herself as the lucky exception to the 
discriminatory rule because at some 
level she realizes that to do otherwise 
simply courts further problems." 

Blologlc•l e xpl• n• tlon? 
Does the fact that women are willing to 
work for less than men suggest some 
inherent psychological difference be-
tween the sexes? Crosby does not en-
tirely rule out the possibility of a 
biological explanation, but she points 
out that the difference between the at-
titudes of low prestige and high 
prestige women is far too great for 
biology to be the most influential fac-
tor; if it were, all women would have 
similar attitudes. A more likely ex-
planation, she says, is that work at-
titudes are largely determined by social 
pressures. 

The paradox of contentedness ap-
plies not only to women but to other 
social groups as well. One of the first 
uses of the relative deprivation theory 
was to explain why, before the equal 
rights movement, black males refused 
to see themselves as victims of racial 
discrimination. The "Uncle Tom" and 
the faithful servant would not believe 
that whites wished them harm. 

Unaeen revolution 
What do these findings bode for the 
future? Will women suddenly wake up 
to the inequities they suffer and 
vocalize their grievances? Crosby 
thinks not. However, her work reveals 
some reversals in public opinion which 
underscore how rapidly the woman's 
role in the work place is changing. The 
tremendous increase in single parent 
homes has been eating away at tradi-
tional gender distinctions. Women 
have been forced into the working 
world and men must spend more time 
attending to household duties. Crosby 
believes that as more and more women 
become th e bread winners, they will 
become more conscious of their status 
relative to men. 

All this change has come so quickly 
that very little research has been done 
to interpret its effects. Crosby's work is 
·pioneer research into an as yet unseen 
revolution. She chooses a suitablt 
domestic metaphor to describe the 
significance of this revolution. "It is 
like defrosting a refrigerator," she said, 
"for a long time it seems that nothing is 
happening. But after enough of its 
sides have been exposed, a whole 
chunk of ice suddenly tumbles down. _ 
Since the Second World War there has 
been a gradual thaw in traditional 
gender roles, now the ice is coming 

P'uture re•••roh 
Next summer Dr. Crosby will publish 
the conclusions she has drawn from the 
Newton study. In her next project she 
would like to examine how divorced 
women and single mothers feel about 
their jobs. Are they just as placid about 
their working conditions as were the 
women of the Newton Study? Or have 
they gained through their indepen-
dence a new self-awareness?
