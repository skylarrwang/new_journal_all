from Sweden ... Austrian elegant and 
necrophiles ... Ability to comprehend 
German required. For advanced studmts. 
That course description, from the 
1975-76 bluebook, 
wa~ Schoolfield's 
parody. Schoolfield does teach one 
course called "Decadence" and another 
("Scandanavian Fin de Sieclej on Nor-
dic decadence. But don't let the name 
fool you. "Students expect perversion 
and degeneration. That's not what 
concerns me at all," Schoolfield said. 
His courses examine decadence as a 
literary movement in 
the 
1890s 
dominated by a sense of coming to the 
end of a century, a civilization, and the 
world. "When I first started reading 
the literature, I thought, 'this isn't 
decadence.' Then I realized it's all 
about decay," said Senior Bibi Ford, a 
student in the Scandanavian deca-
dence course. 

Schoolfield's scholarship, however, 
ranges far beyond the 1890s. "He's a 
one man 
comp-lit department," 
graduate student Andreas Hausler 
said. Sammons described Schoolfield's 
translations as extremely graceful. "I 
think his translating work has been im-
portant. Very few can translate from 
German to English well, and he can." 
Schoolfield has three specialties: 
Neo-Latin and Baroque literature with 
an emphasis on German Baroque, 
Modern literature up to 1920 with a 
focus on the German lyric poet Ranier 
Maria Rilke, 
and Scandanavian 
literature with a focus on Finland's 
Swedish-speaking authors. (He refers 
to their work as "Swedo-Finnish"). 
"Any one of those would be enough for 
us," Sammons said. "He's got an 
unbelievable range." 

"I don't have the seriousness to 
spend my life with a single thing," 
claimed Schoolfield. His recent in-
terest in the 1890s, he said, had many 
sources: a revie~ he wrote on a book 
about that period, his biography on 
Rilke, the cuh of the musician-genius 
in German literature in the 1890s and 
"the particular brilliance of Swedo-
Finnish literature slightly later on." 

._. Finland's Swedish authors, he said, 
were "a cultured minority with a strong 
sense of being swallowed up ... They 
were the owners of a decadent sen-
sibility." He has a general interest in 
dying languages and cultures, which 
often produce decadent literature. But 
he emphasized that the Swedo-Finns 
now have more respect for the Finnish 
majority and their literature i!i thri-
ving. 

Scandanavian studies have probably 
been Schoolfields' most genuine in-
terest. As a child, he put together the 
Viking cutouts on the back of toasties 
boxes. He was 14 when the Winter 
War in Finland occured, and he recalls 
sitting beside the radio with his father, 
listening to broadcasts direct from 
Finland. The Finnish resistance 
"showed that a small country could 
stand up to a totalitarian monster 
. . . It was genuinely heroic," he said. 
"It made a deep impression on me." He 
still regards Finland as a "brave little 
country sitting on the edge of Russia." 
He also likes "the whole idea of a bi-
lingual literature, a bilingual country 
... I wonder if it's coming from a 
mixed background 
myself." His 
mother, although a native English 
speaker, had a German heritage and 
spoke German, as did other family 
members. In his family, "it was ac-
cepted that being German was a good 
thing. My mother remembered World 
War I and the silly anti-German feel-
ings that existed then. But she was 
quite proud." 

As a child, George Schoolfield did a lot 
of reading, but he was not entirely 
serious. He loved Bram Stocker's 
Dracula, which he read when he was ten 
or eleven. "I 
still 
remember the 
book-an orange book with black let-
ters." He also read Frankenstein, but 
liked Dracula better. "I liked the action 
and the scary parts." 

He was always 
studious. 
"My 
;Jarents taught me to be in awe of 
learned people," he said. In high school 
in Charleston, South Carolina, he lik-
ed Latin. "Loved it! From the first 
word!" His school was "the usual-se-
cond rate. The Latin teaching was 
wretched, but I loved the subject and 
learned a lot on my own." 

When he entered the University of 
Cincinnati at age 17, Schoolfield was 
plunged into a dying German culture. 
He lived in boarding houses run by 
German landladies while World War 
II was in full swing, and one of his 
landladies tried to persuade him not to 
register for the draft. "She said, 'you 
don't want to kill your German 
brothers.' She had the whole scheme 
cooked up . . . A 
real lunatic, I'll 
never forget her. She used to hold little 
Nazi meetings in the basement ... I 
thought they were just silly." He did 
register for the draft, anyway, but was 
deferred because of pneumonia. "I 
would have made a terrible soldier." 

Music and the German language 
brought him into contact with a more 
romantic part of Cincinnati culture . 
He played the French horn and took 
courses at the Cincinnati Conser-
vatory. Most of his friend s were Ger-
man musicians. In the summers he 
went to the zoo opera. "The tenors 
would hit the high notes, and the seals 
would start barking," he recalled. He 
ate in restaurants where people spoke 
German until a stranger entered. "It 
was a life not possible today.'' 

He sees some "unscientific parallels" 
between German-American and 
Swedo-Finnish culture, but stresses the 
cultUres' different fates. 

He studied German partly for prac-
tical reasons: it was a recognized field 
that he was good in. During his 
freshman year, he decided on a career 
in 
academia. 
He had considered 
becoming a professional horn player, 
but concluded that he was better at 
scholarship. After four years in Cincin-
nati earning a B.A. in Classics ('46) 
and an M.A. in German ('47), 
Schoolfield 
entered Princeton and 
found it "duck soup. Little Western in-
nocent turns up at the Ivy League. I 
was scared of the intellectual competi-
tion, but that was no problem. That 
was the happiest discovery of my life, I 
suppose." 

When he enrolled in Princeton's 
Department of Modem Languages, 
Schoolfield was already "firm in my 
mind about going into Scandanavian 
matters.'' But, because he wanted to 
make a living, he studied mainly Ger-
man. Practical matters also forced him 
to complete his doctorate in two years.

"Students expect perver!Won 
and degeneration. That's not 
what concerns me at all." 
"My father said I had to get ofT the 
payroll and out into the real world." So 
in 1949 he wrote his dissertation, left 
Princeton to teach German at Har-
vard; then married Gloria Della Selva. 
He's glad he completed graduated 
school as quickly as he did. "I must say 
I feel sorry for graduate students. You 
see them here, year after year ... I 
wasn't humiliated the way they are." 

He had some difficulty finding a 
scholarly niche that would include his 
various fields. Nonetheless, his career 
progressed to include positions in 
Scandanavian studies as well as Ger-
man. He taught at Harvard, the 
University of Buffalo, 
Duke, 
University of Cincinnati, and the 
University of Pennsylvania before 
coming to Yale in 1969. His teaching 
was interrupted by several leaves of 
absence to work abroad. 

It was on one such leave that 
Schoolfield suffered a frightening acci-
dent. In 1967, when he was living in 
Finland as 
a 
Fulbright Research 
Fellow, the cap of a soda bottle he was 
opening exploded into his face, im-
mediately blinding his left eye and 
threatening the sight of his right eye. 
After several operations, his left eye 
was cosmetically repaired and the sight 
of his right eye saved. However, he still 
has trouble studying in the evening, 
which he attributes to the strain on one 
eye. His blind eye cannot control the 
light that hits it, so in the bright room 
he usually wears sunglasses. 

Schoolfield cares about his teaching. 
"There's no question that his prepara-
tion takes long hours." Kadar said. His 
intellectual method in class although 
eclectic is 
often 
historical and 
positivistic. "You read one poem writ-
ten in 1650, and he gives twenty hand-
outs to show you sources and themes," 
Hausler said. 

Schoolfield finds his notes from 
previous courses "stultifying to look at. 
You have to come back fresh every 
time." He added, "I put myself to sleep 
working out what I'm going to say," in 
class the next day. He works at home, 
getting up as early as 4:30 when he has 
a publishing deadline to meet. "I'm sil-
ly about preparation," he said. "It has 
to be done carefully all the time ... It's 
like playing an instrument. The better 
you get, the harder you work." 

His undergraduate teaching is a vir-
tuoso performance. "The lecture flies 
... You can never fall asleep in that 
class," Ford 
said. 
Before class, 
Schoolfield tries to make himself ner-
vous and eats a candy bar for energy. 
("I'm a Snickers addict, but Milky 
Ways or Three Musketeers will do.") 

Once an undergraduate class begins, 
he's on the move-hurrying between 
the podium and the side blackboard, or 
rolling his arm in a little circle as he 
describes a point. "He always comes up 
with quips. He keeps your attention," 
Sophomore Tarek Sherif said. 

Although Schoolfield conducts his 
graduate seminars far more calmly, he 
again is often extremely entertaining, 
amusing the class with jokes or historic 
gossip. 

But Schoolfield isn't just an enter- _ 
tainer. 
His 
close 
readings and 
historical analyses depend on a quanti-
ty of knowledge that sometimes in-
timidates his class. He wants students 
to talk, and his manner helps the class 
to relax. "Joking and eccentricity 
make what he knows seem less for-
midable," Junior Lawrence Hobbie 
said. Schoolfield also has a great 
memory for students' intelligent ideas. 
"If someone made a good point, he'd 
bring it up in another class," Hobbie 
recalled. 

Both undergraduate and graduate 
students describe Schoolfield as en-
couraging and kind. "He'd lend you his 
entire library," Hausler said. Sherif ad-
ded, "some professors make you feel 
small, because they're intelligent and 
you're not. He's willing to help you." 

Students who aren't inspired to 
study by Schoolfield's classes and en-
couragement are goaded to do so by 
his exams, which-both he and his old 
students agree- are extremely dif-
ficult. His graduate exams routinely 
last for eight hours. "I suffered from 
being cut off after two or three hours. 
They've got the time," he explained. 
"They complain. But I'm so kind to 
them the rest of the term." Several 
students described him as a syrn-



pathetic grader, and he concurred. 
"I've always believed in stern exams, 
generously graded." 

Schoolfield believes that, after all the 
work he's put into his teaching, 
undergraduates should come to his 
classes more often. He remembers and 
comments in 
class on students' 
absences. "I like Yale undergraduates. 
I'd like them better if they came to class 
more," he said. "They disappear for 
three weeks, you think they're dead. 
Then they come in and act as if 
nr-::1ing's happened ... I regard it as a 
personal insult if a student doesn't 
show up. I take it so much to heart." 

Are Yalies decadent? Schoolfield said 
he couldn't answer this question. "I 
know nothing about the private lives of 
Yale students-thank Heavens!" He 
jokingly 
assures students in his 
decadence courses that they are all 
-. decadent. They can find out whether 
he's right by examining decadent 
character types. 

The typical decadent hero, 
Schoolfied said, comes from an old 
family. He goes through periods of ex-
treme lassisitude,' varying with periods 
of extreme energy. He is very learned; 
he constructs an artificial world for 
himself based on the learning of the 
past. 
He has special 
living cir-
cumstances. 

Does this sound familiar? School-
field said that it reminded him of 
Dracula. The well-known vampire 
comes from an old family, experiences 
states of extreme indolence or activity, 
sleeps in a 
coffm. 
Dracula also 
represents the decadent idea that the 
old are stronger than the young, 
Schoolfield said. Dracula. is a hand-
some old man. In fact, Schoolfield ad-
ded, Stocker's Dracula was extremely 
popular with the Victorians mainly 
because of its strong erotic overtones. 

has also examined 
Dracula's historical ancestor, a Roma-
nian Vlad who committed mass im-
palements and other tortuous murders. 
This Vlad Dracula became unpopular 
in Romania mainly because he con-
verted in prison to Roman Cathol-
ocism. After his death, a legend grew 
up that he had been in league with the 
devil. His name "became a metaphor 
for terribly bad activity," and although 
he had not been a vampire, the 
Dracula legend grew to include vam-
pirism. 

"We've attached a humorous air to 
Dracula ... Audiences have this ftxed 
picture of the guy in the black cloak 
and nubile maidens." He tries to make 
his audiences realize the suffering that 
the original Vlad Dracula caused. He 
added,"' feel uncomfortable giving the 
talk." Schoolfield gave the first of his 
three Dracula lectures to the Ladies 
Aid Society, a discussion group of 
obstetricians and gynecologists. "I kept 
asking myself what would be a nice 
subject," he recalled. He has also given 
the talk at the University of Virginia, 
as well as at Yale. 

"The first time I saw him, he looked 
like a character," Sherif said, recalling 
the first Scandanavian fin-de-sieck class 
he went to. He added, "Some air about 
him made me want to stay." Students 
say that the more they got to know 
Schoolfield, 
the less 
eccentric he 
seemed. "He's very sane, actually," 

"I don't know anyone who's as plea-
sant to talk 
to 
as 
Schoolfield," 
Humanities Bibliographer George H. 
Vroomen said. Schoolfield has been 
known to brighten up a class with a 
personal anecdote, and his students 
quickly become aware of his interests 
in opera and movies. He's accessible, 
friendly, and alert. "He pay's attention 
to you, • Vroomen said. 

But Schoolfield's students and col-
leagues also describe him as a very 
private person. "He's got many more 
interests than he'll talk about," Baldwin 
said. Graduate student Jay Lutz add-
ed, "he's a very striking personality. 
He's friendly, 
but maintains a 
distance." Earlier this month, 
Schoolfield left for a semester's leave of 
absence. When asked what he planned 
to do during that period, he answered, 
"it's a secret project."
