of an educational experience. However,
I also think that it is important 
that each student be able to choose 
whether he or she wishes to study a 
foreign language. 

As President 
Giamatti said, making choices is an 
important part of our education and 
the College should thus provide as 
many choices as possible. Additionally,
when a student is forced to take a 
course, 
his attitude 
will 
almost 
definitely be poor. 

Also, in imposing a language re-
quirement, the University could only 
force a student to take one, or at the 
most two years of a language. How 
much actual linguistic knowledge can 
be gained in such a short time, particularly
by a student who is only 
fulfilling a requirement and has little 
motivation? In addition, where would 
non-language, particularly science, 
majors find the time to fulfill such a re-
quirement? It is ludicrous for the Col-
lege to believe that this extra time will 
just appear for students. Other courses 
will have to go untaken. And as languages
are at this point in Distribu-
tional Group I along with English, 
those trying to fulfill distributional re-
quirements may forego English in 
order to satisfy this new requirement. 
This could be disastrous. Those in 
support of the language requirement 
claim that the study of language is an 
integral part of a liberal education. 
Well, communicating in the English 
language is a critical part of surviving 
in American society, and thus seems 
slightly more important. All this could 
be a reason to create an additional 
English requirement that would further
restrict academic freedom. 

In addition 
to graduation 
re-
quirements, the Committee is considering
whether to institute proficiency levels
for applicants. There is a 
serious problem here. This proposal is 
clearly discriminatory. 

There are 
public school systems in this country 
that cannot possibly afford to offer 
foreign language instruction, and even 
Yale requiring such training for admis-
sion will not change the situation. 
Yet despite these problems there is a 
good chance that some form of require-
ment will be placed in effect. Thus, I 
would like to make a suggestion for the 
levels that might be required. These 
levels should take into account students 
who already have some proficiency 
and those who have limited time due to 
major requirements. 

Harvard appears to have developed 
such a fair system. There the universi-
ty will exempt from the language re-
quirement those with 
a 
foreign 
language achievement score of 560 or 
greater and/or a score of three or better 
on a language Advanced Placement 
Test. Students unable to meet these 
restrictions must take one year of a 
language of their choice. If there must 
be a requirement, this seems to me to 
be a fair system. I hope that the 
University Course of Study Commit-
tee will keep these words in mind as it 
considers whether to further restrict 
the choices available to undergraduates 
in their educational careers here at 
Yale.
