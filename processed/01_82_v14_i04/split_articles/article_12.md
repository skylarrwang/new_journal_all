"Impalement as Pastime: Reflections 
on Dracula in Literature." The impec-
cably dressed speaker had a reasonable 
voice, tinged with a German accent, 
and didn't look like an expert on any 
sort or cruelty. His focus was historical 
and lirerary. "A solidly researched 
piece of s<:h9Jarship," recalled graduate 
student Mar]) Kadan who organized 
the lecture. But somehow at times the 
audience couldn't stop laughing. 
Maybe it was -the bloody marys that 
the German Club, which sponsored 
the speech, served. -~aybe it was the 
terrible puns: "I have no stake in this 
lecture" and "Vlad the lmpaler was 
really beyond the pale." But the fun-
niest thing was the contrast between 
the speaker and his subject. "What he 
was saying was grotesque," Senior 
Birgit Baldwin recalled. "But he's such 
a polite, genteel person. If it had been 
someone you'd expected it from, it 
wouldn't have been so funny." 

The speaker was George C . School-
Professor George Schoolfield 
field, a Professor of German and Scan-
danavian Literature who's had an ex-
ceptional career in both languages. He 
received his Ph.D. at Princeton when 
he was 23, writing his dissertation in 
one term, and he was tenured at 29. 
"Everyone in the field in the world 
knows who he is," German Professor 
Jeffrey Sammons said. He's been 
decorated by the Finnish government 
for cultural services to Finland, and 
he's published translations of works 
from four languages. A few students 
think he's crazy, but no one falls asleep 
in his class:'
