How law school 
limits one's view 
Steve Epstein 
In September, 1980, Dean Wellington 
gave his annual welcoming speech to 
the incoming Yale Law School class, 
'my class. All I remember of Dean 
Wellington's speech was his assertion 
that we would no longer be poets or 
pianists, that now we would learn to be 
lawyers. 

My immediate reaction was refusal: 
I would continue to write, and I hoped 
every musician in the Law School con-
tinued to play. But later I learned that 
Dean Wellington did not mean that 
law school should ftll every moment of 
our lives; in response to a student pro-
test of the prior year, he meant to in-
form us that Yale Law School intended 
to teach law, and had no obligation to 
teach anything else. 

For me, though, Dean Wellington's 
words remain a symbol of the central 
problem of law school life: the tension 
between sincerely studying law and be-
ing able to escape the law student's 
limited world view. 

Our professors tell us they intend to 
teach us to "think like lawyers," which 
means 
to 
rationally 
apply 
legal 
categories to human situations. Two 
kinds of everyday thought aren't part 
of that process: non-rational thinking 
and thinking outside the legal system. 
Intuition, emotion and faith have no 
use in legal thinking. And morality, 
politics, and other ideological systems 
are irrelevent to legal decisions such as 
a jury's determin~tion of guilt or in-
nocence. 

Admittedly, the reason for having 
judges and lawyers "think like lawyers" 
is to prevent anarchy. But in studying 
law, we start to think that way all the 
time. It's hard not to; once you think 
like a lawyer, everything can be dealt 
with quite neatly and rationally. Mter 
a few weeks of school, law students Â·go 
to fewer concerts, read fewer novels 
and newspapers, and talk almost ex-
clusively about law, because occur-
rences outside the legal framework 
have become less significant than those 
within. 

As I write this, I am acutely con-
scious that my ideas sound speculative, 
that I can't prove them, and that 
therefore they are un-law-student-like 
ideas. But if you think like a lawyer, 
you won't get angry: 
Let's try w understand our areas of difference. 
You won't fall in love : 
I don~ have tirru to get involved with him/her 
ril]ht now. 
You won't be amazed: 
The sun is coming up, I ought w eat 
breakfast. 

Dean Wellington's words remind me 
that you can't be a poet or pianist 
without getting angry, or falling in 
love, or being filled with wonder. 
Something essential to human life is 
Walter Jacob 
lost when emotions, intuition, and em-
pathy are abandoned. But law school 
thinking has a 
fascination which 
crowds out the non-rational. What can 
be thought of in legal terms is thought 
of in that way. What can't be thought 
of in legal terms isn't thought of at all. 

Dedication to ideological convictions 
is also discouraged by legal thinking. 
In law school, we learn that any view 
or action which isn't overtly illegal is 
justifiable as far as the legal system is 
concerned. As a result, we become 
cynical. If any point of view can be 
supported or attacked, it doesn't mat-
ter which side you're on. And if either 
side is acceptable, you may as well 
work for someone who will pay a lot of 
money. Last year, a lawyer from a 
public interest group in Washington, 
D .C. spoke of a survey which found 
that 80 per cent of entering Yale law 
students say they want to do public in-
terest work, and that 80 per cent of 
graduating Yale law students take 
lucrative jobs with firms and corpora-
tions. 

Of course, there are law students 
who act on political ideologies; in Oc-
tober, 40 of them picketed a panel 
discussion of terrorism which was 
dominated by 
conservatives and 
chaired by the CIA's Chief Counsel. 
Some law students (and professors) 
continue to pursue their artistic in-
terests; 
Professors Boris Bittker 
sculpts, and Professor Charles Black 
paints. And some law students even 
fall in love. 

The effects of law school, though, 
can be invidious. Until recently, I had 
thought that my interests outside law 
school kept me from being affected. 
But a friend of mine read a draft of this 
essay and informed me that it aptly 
describes the way I think. 

So law school frightens me. It makes 
sense that law school teaches me to 
think like a lawyer, rather than like a 
poet or pianist; 
I'm learning to 
analyze, define, and argue legal issues 
with great effectiveness. But a by-
product of the learning process is that 
my ideals and other aspects of my 
humanity are clouded. The question I 
ask myself: When I graduate, and 
receive a diploma conferring signifi-
cant power in our society, will I still 
have non-legal qualities and convic-
tions on which to stand?
