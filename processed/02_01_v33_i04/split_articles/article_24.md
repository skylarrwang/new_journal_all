EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Public access television struggles to meet the standards set by its commercial counterpart. The offices of crv were filled with cheap imitation and kitsch: fake plastic ferns, a portrait of jazz not-so-great Maynard Ferguson. This aesthetic extended to the set. The "ceiling" that would appear on TV consisted of nothing more than a two-by-four. I had to help the crew move a couch from crv's reception area onto the set, thinking as I struggled to maintain my grip that Katie Couric and Matt Lauer probably had permanent seating. "The 3rd Eye" was produced by a team of unpaid volunteers and its director was also its producer, its graphic designer, its art director, and its promotional-refrigerator-magnet assembler.


Just two and a half hours after the taping was scheduled to begin, everything was almost in place. However, a final problem needed to be solved. "Has anyone seen the intern?" the director asked in a harried voice. It seemed that the intern, who was supposed to run camera number two during the taping, had left the studio. And that left only one unoccupied person in the station: myself. I was pulled into the studio, given a thorough introduction to the camera-
"This is the zoom. This is the focus. Don't flip this switch or the camera will fall to the ground and break into a number of small pieces"-and handed a headset. The taping began.


RUNNING A CAMERA was much easier than I expected. The camera doesn't move if you don't want it to and the director was generally easy to please, so I didn't have much to worry about. This gave me time to consider the profoundly metaphysical significance of the production of which I was now a part. To Z, crv and all other forms of public access provide an opportunity for voices that are lacking in the mainstream media. "This is Citizens Television. Anyone who considers themselves a citizen of society should be able to get involved and produce a show .... They should have an alternative to everything that's on the major channels." Ruben shares this grandiose vision of public access, believing that "The 3rd Eye" and other public access shows pose a serious threat to the dominant forms of television and the big media giants. "Public access is the only real line that people have to freedom of expression, freedom of contact with other people, freedom to utilize technology in a way that doesn't reflect a bottom line. It's TV for the community by the community. Public access is a common ground for everyone, regardless of their ideas or beliefs. When a nation stops thinking critically about its experience, you're in trouble. If we don't have a public access outlet, the critical thinking is zero. Critical thinking will make or break our country."


Although Ruben, with 25 years of experience in public access, was an impassioned pitchman for these ideas, I was not convinced.


Ironically, the success of public access is dependent on the very entities that it condemns-the giant cable networks that carry its signals. The station where Ruben now works as operations manager, the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, is dependent for its financial existence upon AOL Time Warner, one of the country's largest and most dominant media giants. While this may pose problems for a station's credibility, it did allow me to understand one of the pleasures of public access television: We were using the tools and financial resources of the cable companies to create something of which they would never dream.


I don't believe that public access will change the world. Still, I found something seductive in the rhetoric used by Z and Ruben. The shows are created by volunteers and aired without concern for market share or advertising revenue, unlike anything in modern commercial television. The same individuality that creates programming uninteresting to all but a select few also makes it unlike anything found on the commercial channels.
