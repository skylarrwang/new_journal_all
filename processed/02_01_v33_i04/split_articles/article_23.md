AMER.A NUMBER TWO, ZOOM IN and give me your twO shot. 
There you go. Can you get the frwt basket and the sign too? 
Great, I'll take that. Ready camera number rwo. Take camera num-
ber two." The two people I'd just trapped in the small black and 
white box on top of my camera appeared in full color on the televi-
sion screens placed at either side of the stage. Unfortunately, the 
perfection of my framing was quickly interrupted by what seemed 
to be an on-screen earthquake. "What the fuck was that?" screamed 
the confused director. A glance at the base of my camera revealed 
that the sign-man ruffling through cue cards ("PSA" and "5 minutes" 
and "Smile!"} had delivered a blow to the base of my camera. It was 
my first mistake of the day, astonishing when one considered that 
I'd learned how to handle the mechanical beast less than 2.0 minutes 
ago. Apparently, Citizens Television truly does believe in public 
access: I'd entered a television studio for the first time in my life, 
and three hours later I was a part of the show. 

Mv INTEREST IN CITIZENS TELEVISION (CIV} STEMMED from a news 
blurb in the New Haven Advocat~. The local public access station 
had recendy finished the search for a new executive director. Instead

of hiring the candidate with ample experience who was anxious to 
return to New Haven, crv's board of directors had picked a less-
experienced candidate who was also the board's former president. 
The station was being sued by Ruben Abreu, Jr., a former executive 
direccor who claimed that he was unfairly pushed out of his job so 
that the same board president could take over his position. While 
similar power plays from New Haven's unscrupulous public ser-
vants no longer shock me, the motivations for this particular 
maneuver escaped me. Who in their right mind would stage such a 
calculated takeover for what seemed to be a humble position with 
an unimpressive salary at an unimportant organization? 

To get a better sense of what was happening at Citizens 
Television, I called a friend. I knew Zannerre Lewis as a program 
director for the Regional Cultural Plan for Greater New Haven, 
where I worked last summer. However, the astrological chart she'd 
done for me, and her explanation of an eclipse's significance for our 
workplace, revealed another side of her personality. To many area 
fans of the metaphysical, Zannette is known only as Z, the host of 
a crv show called "The 3rd Eye." I came to crv to watch a taping 
of her show, which occupied the important slot opposite "Dawson's 
THE NEW JouRNAL 

Creek" in crv 's lineup. What did CIV hope could steal viewers from 
Joey, Pacey, and Dawson? According to Z, her show is "a metaphys-
ical talk show whose purpose is m give the public information about 
the relationship of energy and matcer as it relates to their journey m 
higher levels of existence." Z appears on Channel 27 discussing cop-
ies ranging from tai chi and yoga to astrological charts to Native 
American and Eastern divination. "[By watching the show,] you'll 
get an understanding of what you need to do to be highly evolved 
as a person or spirit on the planet," claims Z, who is quick ro argue 
that her show is not merely a circus act. "Initially, they just wanted 
me to come on and do readings, but I thought that the community 
needed to see people who are on their path to the third eye. I want-
ed to do the show at a higher level than that of a psychic fair." 

I entered the world of public access out of curiosity. Z, on the 
other hand, was recruited. "I was just finishing up a project at the 
Peabody and I had an opportunity to go-on TV and talk about the 
relationship between the environment and culture. CIV was losing 
its astrology show at the time and Ruben knew that I had also found 
astrologers for the Peabody, so he asked me to consider doing a 
show. They felt that this was an area that the community needed 
FEBRUARY 9Â· 2001 
info about, so they decided to ask me." Z claims her show is 
needed because much of crv's lineup consists of evangelical 
Christian programming. I had trouble accepting the idea that the 
best counterpoim to the programming of the irrational religious 
right was a "metaphysical talk show." 

As I WANDERED AROUND THE STUDIO AND LISTENED TO THE 
small bits of conversation that drifted my way, it became appar-
ent that not everyone there was motivated by Z's desire for free 
intellectual discourse. John, a fellow camera operator, was a 
friend of the director with nothing else to do that day. The sound 
recorder seemed concerned mainly with his own "fame," using 
the studio's headset system to explain his plans to usurp another 
show's anchorship. Z's guests mainly saw the show as an oppor-
tunity to advertise their services. Ruben himself, unable to talk 
about his own dismissal because of pending legal actions, admits 
that many involved in public access lack the high ideals of Z. 
Some, in fact, see the tiny sound stage as an arena for power. 
"When they're in charge of their TV show," Ruben said, "they 
rule."
