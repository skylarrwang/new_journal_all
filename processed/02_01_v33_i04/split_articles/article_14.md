The mayor has not run the city of New Haven for the last · 
seven years on charisma and congeniality. He doesn't court the 
press, and much of the time the media has responded in kind. But 
DeStefano doesn't seem to mind-he simply tells his mom not to 
read the Nng Haven Advocate. DeStefano's supporters know that he 
doesn't go out of his way to be delicate, or even tactful. "He's got-
ten calloused about making decisions that have to be made but will 
piss people off," says Matthew Nemerson, former CEO of the New 
Haven Chamber of Commerce. "And he doesn't tell them he's sorry 
about it. [DeStefano] has presented an image of himself that is 
tough and unemotional. A lot of people have assumed he's arrogant 
and uncaring," Nemerson adds. "I don't think that's true, but he 
comes off that way." 


MARTIN LoONEY SITS AT A CONFERENCE TABLE in his Orange Street 
office across the street from City Hall, with his hands folded on the 
table. At 52, Looney is seven years older than DeStefano. His smile 
and his smaller stature make him a less intimidating presence than 
the mayor, and while DeStefano expects people to know what he's 
accomplished and dismisses those who · do not, Looney wants to 
explain to everyone why he should be mayor. 
"I think the city is prepared for a change," Looney says. "There 
is a lq_ss of energy," he adds, speaking of DeStefano's City Hall. 
With two decades in the state legislature and prior experience in 
city politics, Looney thinks he is just the person to bring a new atti-
tude into the city government. And Looney and his supporters offer 
other reasons why the mayor should lose his job. DeStefano, they 
say, does not play well with others.

Mayor John DeStefano 
LAsT YEAR, DESTEFANO SENT A LETTER accusing Looney of shirking 
his duty as a state senator by not bringing adequate state funds to 
New Haven. According to DeStefano, he was merely doing his job. 
"As quarterback of the city ... I'm here to see that this is a healthy 
community," he says. But Looney, and some members of the Board 
of Aldermen, see the letter as "symptomatic of his overall approach 
of being divisive and harsh rather than consensus-building." 
Looney claims that the mayor's inability to work with others 
has cost him the support of many of his former Democratic party 
allies. "There's been a sort of estrangement and alienation from a 
number of people in the community, and obviously the mayor's try-
ing to turn that into an advantage by saying that the fact that he 
doesn't have a relationship with x, Y, and z is because of his own 
actions," he says. But in Looney's eyes, the mayor's break from the 
Democratic Party's machine does not signal a reformed City Hall; 
rather, the mayor has created his own system of patronage--a 
machine that revolves less around the party and more around those 
individuals who give to the mayor's campaign. Looney pledges to 
dismande that machine. "My approach to government will be 
inclusive, participatory, responsive to segments of the community," 
he says. "It will signal an end to factionalism, and a unified party 
and administration."
