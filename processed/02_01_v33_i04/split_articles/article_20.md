**Title: How Yale Jumped on the High Tech Train with Project X**

IN THE SUMMER OF 1996, not long after people began to get excited about the pace of the new econo-
my, rwo ofYale's highest officers met to discuss how the University would keep up. For Provost Alison 
Richard and Associate Vice President Joseph Mullinix, there was reason to worry: Yale's mainframes and 
administrative systems were becoming obsolete, and business practices lagged years behind the latest 
technology. Most antiquated was the University's 15-year-old accounting software, which had been 
designed when Yale was a significantly less prosperous place than it is today. On top of questions of 
mere obsolescence was the almost religious fervor surrounding Y2K, the modern twist to the familiar 
apocalypse story (which still turned out less bang than whimper). Even more dire than the state of 
aging buildings and facilities around campus, it seemed, was the delicate starus ofYale's digital infra-
structure. 

Richard and Mullinix quickly called for a committee and working groups to address the problem. 
Over 6o individuals from all levels of the University would assist in the effort and report back to the 
administration with their findings. They were asked to submit a preliminary budget, evaluate poten-
tial contractors, and develop an overall program strategy. They eventually proposed what rurned out 
to be the largest, costliest, and most controversial restructuring program in Yale's history-the omi-
nous, if unirnpressively named, Project X. Project X promised to change almost every aspect of the way 
Yale conducted business, from making office life paperless to automating tasks that once involved an 
intricate hierarchical chain of people and processes. It heralded nothing less than a new work envi-
ronment, free from so-called "redundancy," guided by the new (and yet old) economic virtues of effi-
ciency, rapidity, and automation. Four years, $wo million, and the retraining of several hundred 
employees later, nearly everyone at Yale agrees that Project X has done all these things. They only dis-

agree as to whether this constitutes a success, or a minor catastrophe. 

NoBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THE X IN PROJECT X STANDS FOR. Certainly it's better than the offi-
cial name (the Yale "Finance and Human Resources Modernization Project") that was somehow 
approved. Still, almost every affected Yale employee, at one time or another, has probably felt its unof-
ficial name signified something unsavory: One woman I spoke with said she believed it stood for "X-
cruciacing"; "X-cessive" was another guess I heard; a third, "X-crement." Feelings of prolonged frus-
tration are also expressed by the Project's most vocal supporters and by people who were instrumental 
in bringing it about. Mk any Yale employee co calk about the early stages of Project X, and the response 
you get will inevitably be clinical. (The word "painful" seems especially popular; one person made an 
extended comparison to surgery.) "We survived," said Dean Plummer, one of the Project's architects. 
"We got through it. Ic was painful, but we made it." 

Before Yale had to worry about such things as Y2K compliance, the routine functions of office 
work--check requests, payroll, accoum maintenance-were largely a matter of directing paper forms 
co specific offices. Requests co purchase anything from a stapler to a new computer required handling 
by the Purchasing Office. There were Payroll people, Grants Management people, Personnel people, 
Accounts Payable people, and so on. In order to be reimbursed for the simplest personal expense, for 
example, an employee would have to fill out one form, have that form signed by the office business 
manager, then send it up the street to the first floor of 155 Whitney, Accounts Payable, where another 
pale face would look it over, sign it, and chen send it back down the street. Even then, you could never 
really be sure the envelope would complete its journey. 

No one much doubted that the Project X operation would be at least mildly painful; what came 
as a surprise was the extent of the trauma. Back in 1996, when the Yale Steering Committee first began 
investigating the available upgrade options, it had the experience of peer institutions to instruct it. T he 
University of Pennsylvania had beaten everyone to the line, going live with a limited installation of 
Oracle database software in July 1996. Penn had asked Oracle simply to update certain of its financial 
systems and to patch up others for Y2K compliance in a gradual rollouc over the course of several years. 
Princeton and Stanford had similar plans. Harvard, on the other hand, announced that it was over-
hauUng nearly all of its administrative systems at once. In so doing. it kick-started the kind of back-
and-forth race that characterizes most policy changes in universities today. The imperative was dear: 
Yale had to meet its competitors' challenge. Would Old Blue merely hold pace with the new econo-
