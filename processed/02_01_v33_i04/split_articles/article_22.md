These are the pesky women who, to 
t.(OcP's dismay, still complain of having dif-
t1el.llcy with the Oracle software. They 
·-.ork in residential college master's offices, 
hl libraries, and in smaller academic 
4cpanments, where on top of everyday 
qtrical tasks was suddenly placed the bur-
den of learning a difficult and unwieldy 
Oncle system. These are the women-so 
10t;s the complaint-who were never asked 
ahout Project X and never once asked for it; 
whe wen: told one day that other people 
were "n:engineering" their jobs, and that 
they ~uld have to get with the program. 
ncse are the women who answer phones 
and process student payroll, keep track .of 
hiring .and maintain department budgets, 
lox whom life is still anything but paper-
ie., and for whom Oracle's 30-digit pro-
casi~ numbers are no simpler than the 
fotms they once had to fiU out. 

' ~ . "The pressure and frustration oflearn-
il'l the systems and the programs when 
YG\J don't use them every day makes it very 
p.inful," said one master's assistant, who 
uld she eould only talk while the coUege

AIDibs about Project X has to be approved 
.)J 1he director of her office, who has asked 
"'- she refer all questions to him. A third 
Yale employee in the Benefits Office knows 
co-workers who have retired because of 
Project X and current employees who feel 
overly burdened by the new systems. She 
promises to ask if anyone would be inter-
ested in talking, then calls back a few days 
later and says all would rather not revisit 
the issue. 

NEARLY EVERYONE DIRECTLY involved pros-
pered handsomely as a result of Project X. 
Oracle came away with millions and a suc-
cessful partnership to advertise in wooing 
other universities. Yale installed one of the 
most sophisticated financial systems in the 
world and retrained its administrative 
workforce in the process, while reporting 
only minimal injuries. 
Individual actors 
prospered as well: Sunderland, the Project 
director, soon left Yale to work for Oracle; 
Daniel Updegrove, head of ITS during the 
Project, also left shortly after completion to 
head the much larger IT services depart-
ment for the University ofTexas at Austin. 
Most successful was probably Mullinix, 
who took a position as Senior Vice 
President of Business and Finance of the 
California state university system, despite 
teUing Profit magaz.ine that he looked for-
ward to using Oracle software to print out 
his Yale budget reports. 

But while Project X was a smash for 
the administration, it became merely 9 to 5 
for the people in the offices--the ones who 
carry out the bold initiatives of the so-
called new economy. The C&'T women's 
complaints would probably strike most 
M&Ps as idle, even willfully archaic. After 
all, no one but the most wistful Romantic 
really feels any sympathy for the Luddites, 
who smashed their bosses' 
weaving 
machines but live on today mainly as 
quaint relics of an older age. Today's work-
ing world, it seems, is unique in that the 
hammers can be ordered direcdy with 
Oracle Purchasing-only minutes before 
attending a session advising how to 
"Prepare for Change."
