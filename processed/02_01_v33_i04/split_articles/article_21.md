my--or would it pull, so to speak, into the 
lead? 

The working groups reported back 
with their findings in a lengthy study, 
which discussed the many shortcomings of 
·Yale's existing systems and proposed a bold 
corrective. 

They found, in their own 
words, that obsolete software and antiquat-
ed business practices were often "impeding 
the best efforts of faculty and staff." They 
argued that the entire University commu-
nity was frustrated and distracted by "com-
plex, time-consuming, and costly adminis-
trative processes in the course of their aca-
demic work." The study maintained that 
while Yale could, conceivably, foUow the 
more tentative course taken by Penn-
patching some systems and upgrading only 
those in the most critical condition-an 
alternative if more challenging option was 
open to them. 

Rather than go halfway, 
Yale could go the better way-the way of 
Harvard-and even a step beyond. In one 
giant leap forward, Yale could "reengineer" 
not only its technology, but also the equal-
ly obsolete routines of its users. 

The University agreed; 
and 
m 
September, with Pentium-like speed, the 
Yale Corporation approved funding for a 
large-scale tech upgrade. Accompanying 
the ongoing facilities renovation project 
would be an equally intensive renovation of 
information technology. 

The lucrative 
contract, initially projected at $30 million, 
went to Silicon Valley database giant 
Oracle, whose CEO, Larry Ellison, is the 
second richest person in America. With 
Oracle promising that "the deluge of papers 
and forms that can overwhelm even the 
most efficient Yale staff members will soon 
become a thing of the past," the University 
signed a four-year agreement with the com-
pany, making Yale a test site for some of its 
newest database and financial systems. 
Project X was officially born. 

AN ARMY OF PROGRAMMI:!RS and consul-
tants from Oracle and KPMG were called in 
to begin implementing the new system. 

Soon, it became clear that Project X would 
be a learning experience for both the doc-
tors and the patient. By 1997, Oracle had 
already overseen complete system overhauls 
for businesses and governments around the 
world, but never for a university. 

New 
technology was to replace obsolete systems 
in any department or office that main-
tained its own payroll, purchasing, general 
accounting, financial planning, or grant 
funding-which is to say, every single 
office at Yale. The everyday tasks that once 
required eight separate forms sent to eight 
separate central departments would now be 
handled by a single web-based system. The 
old mainframe was to be completely 
replaced with rwo brand-new IBM servers, 
which could be accessed by 2,000 screens 
simultaneously over a new fiber-optic net-
work. Beyond mere boldness, Yale could 
also claim credit for being a trendsetter, the 
first university to commit itself to such a 
massive undertaking. 

But being first 
counts more in some races than in others, 
and the distinction of being first with 
Project X was rather dubious. 

A month after the Corporation 
approved the project, Richard and Mullinix 
announced the new initiative, already 
going by the unofficial moniker "Project 
X," in a letter printed in the October 7-14 
issue of the Yale Bulletin & Calendar. An 
official statement of goals, in no particular 
order, was soon drafted, and would become 
nearly omnipresent in the Project X litera-
ture: 

[I)mproving management and plan-
ning at all University levels; providing 
higher-quality administrative services 
to faculty, students, staff, alumni, 
donors and sponsors; improving rev-
enues; and reducing risk through more 
reliable business support systems. 

Also in October, the Oracle people came in 
and set up temporary headquarters at 12 
Prospect Place. Working with them to test 
the software were uo full-time workers 
from across the University-people from 
the Arts and Sciences faculty, Athletics, the 
School of Forestry, Yale College, and 
Animal Care. Over the next four months, 
team members would learn the software 
and then propose how it could be tailored 
to best meet Yale's needs. They developed 
product specifications and suggested design 
changes along the way. Meanwhile, Oracle 
planned Yale's future database system-
projected at 1.2 terabytes worth of code, or 
the equivalent of around 50 million vol-
umes of the Encyc/op~dia Britannica. 

Once the pilot testing of the Oracle 
software was completed in March, Yale 
began the more arduous task of phasing 
out its existing systems while adjusting 
employees to the new ones. That same 
month, Project X sent out some 500 invita-
tions to business managers, department 
heads, and other staff to take part in a 
training program advertised as "the most

extensive ever offered by the University.: 
Sessions covering everything from software 
usage to "Preparing for Change" would 
help employees with the difficult learning 
process. T he handsome new office housing 
Project X on the nimh floor of a downtown 
building was equipped with itS own train-
ing room and a fleet of new computers for 
group sessions. A separate learning center, 
similarly appointed, soon went up at 220 
Whitney. Suddenly, it seemed that not a 
day went by when Yale employees weren't 
being invited to avail themselves of focus 
groups, full-day workshops, 
business 
redesign workshops, management issues 
forums, hands-on training, implementa-
tion planning, in-depth briefing sessions, 
and telephone support. No topic was con-
sidered self-explanatory, and training ses-
sions always restricted class sizes, of course, 
so as not to discourage the group from ask-
ing questions. 

The planners, it must be said, were 
certainly mindful of the people uncomfort-
able with Project X. Steve Sunderland, the 
Project manager, told the Bulktin · & 
Cakndar (in the first of itS series of articles 
devoted to the subject} that he was "fully 
aware" that "for some people on campus 
who have become accustomed to doing 
their jobs the same way for many years, the 
modernization might make them anxious 
about bow the changes will affect them." 
Sunderland stressed that everyone--rony-
one--would have the opportunity to be 
trained. 

"There's no doubt that such a 
major change can be scary," acknowledged 
Margaret Plympton, another director of 
Project X. For chat reason, she said, her 
team was working hard co make people feel 
FEBRUARY 9· 2001 
ac ease about the transition, since, natural-
ly, "we'll all be going through the change-
over together." 

ONE BY ONE, Yale began to transform exist-
ing systems into "modernized" Oracle 
equivalentS. By the summer of 1998, Yale 
had successfully installed the first round of 
Oracle human resources (HR) and account-
ing applications. Already, it was becoming 
easy to see how Project X would change 
office life. Redundancy could now be 
replaced by simple, efficient automation. 
No longer would HR staffers spend their 
days photocopying and filing the 12,500 
resumes that Yale receives each year; now 
they could simply be dropped into a scan-
ner and filed electronicalJy. As Mullinix 
told Oracle's company publication, the 
baldly tided Profit magazine, "The princi-
pal idea is, 'Do it right; do it once."' 

But the Oracle transition team stood 
to learn something from the ethic pro-
pounded by Mullinix. It is difficult to 
gauge precisely how faithful Project X was 
to its self-imposed deadlines because those 
dares were changed many times and hardly 
any of them was actually met. Originally, 
Project X was to be completed in two phas-
es-the first phase, largely clerical and 
technical in nature, in July 1998, and the 
second phase, largely administrative, in 
April 1999. In reality, the final launch was 
delayed three times because of, well, tech-
nical difficulties. 

As the April deadline 
approached, test after test uncovered new 
problems to solve. As April I became May 
1 and then, just as quickly, July I, the 
Project architects went on the defensive. 
With 
uncommon 
prescience, 
Dean 
Plummer contrasted the modernization 
process with an election: "It's not like an 
election when on a certain date you fmd 
out who won and that's the end of it," he 
told a Yak Daily News reporter. "It's more 
like a learning process where you sign up 
for a lesson and come out much, much 
smarter." 

Without a finished product to intro-
duce to employees, Project X was forced to 
continue offering training programs for 
software that didn't yet exist. And the delay 
only served to aggravate further the 
hideous budget overrun that saw Project X 
go three times over itS original $30 million 
allocation. When the new Oracle software 
fmally went live on July 6, 1999, no one 
really knew what ro expect. O n July 9, 
when the first batch of paychecks was 
printed, they got an idea. 

T he checks showed up at the wrong 
location. Such was the inauspicious open-
ing, and more of the same was to come. 
Staff benefitS were calculated improperly; 
data entry errors, bugs, and glitches kept 
reappearing in the system. Employees, 
upon opening the web-based Oracle pro-
grams, seemed much less competent than 
the Project directors had hoped. Some 
employees complained that there was not 
enough qualified technical staff around to 
help the less experienced, and some prob-
lems left even the technicians themselves 
scratching their heads. 

Almost nothing went well during the 
first year of Project X. Clerical and techni-
cal staff, in particular-the 2,800 predomi-
nantly middle-aged, female employees sit-
ting at desb and keeping the University 
operating-were finding it difficult to 
learn programs they used only sporadicalJy. 


This proved worrisome, because for the 
first time, all Yale offices and academic 
departments were to submit their budget 
proposals-formerly plotted on a simple 
Excel spreadsheet, or even handwritten 
with pen and paper-in the new Oracle 
format. In February 2000, 
officials 
announced that the University budget for 
fiscal year 2001 would not be completed 
until two months after its usual April sub-
mission deadline because of lingering 
Project X growing pains. 

Still, in hindsight it appears that 
Project X was far less painful than it could · 
have been. In March 2000, Ohio State and 
Cleveland State, which had chosen to work 
with Oracle's competitor, PeopleSoft, 
reported that their system upgrades were 
proceeding miserably. Ohio learned that 
its project, estimated at $53 million over. 
three years, would cost $90 million and 
take six years. Yale also had the satisfaction 
of trumping its neighbor in Cambridge. 

Like Yale, Harvard had begun planning a 
systems upgrade back in 1996, and even 
gave the effort a similarly bland name, 
Project ADAPT. 

Also like Yale, Harvard, 
working with Oracle, went far over budget, 
faced delays, and-perhaps believing that 
one Game a year wasn't enough-also set-
tled on a July 1 deadline. But whereas the 
turnover at Yale is retrospectively deemed 
manageable, Harvard offices are still strug-
gling with their transition to Oracle, and 
Project ADAPT is widely considered an 
embarrassment. 

IN DECEMBER 1999, with all the new sys-
tems finally in place, Mullinix told the YON 
that it would be difficult to calculate exact-
ly how much Yale had spent on the Project: 
"The problem is that the Project is many 
projects and so it all depends on what you 
include in the cost estimate." Mullinix had 
a personal stake in Project X as one of its 
original planners, which may explain his 
weak explanation to the same reporter: "It's 
just such a mishmash of scuff that it is very 
hard to come up with a number." 

Officially, the matter was handled with 
30 
more decorum. In Yale's financial state-
ment for fiscal year 1999, the figure given 
for all the training and technology was over 
$100 million-$33 million in 1998, when 
things were running smoothly, and $70.5 
million in 1999, when they were not. A 
staggering amount of money-and yet, in 
these fat and plentiful economic days, only 
a fraction of the $1.24 billion 
Yale spent to keep the 
University running in 1999. 

One year 
later, 
in 
February 2001, a near-unani-
mous 
consensus 
deems 
Project X a success. Across 
the board, administrators say 
that, while they wouldn't 
want to revisit the early days 
of the Project, it has had a 
positive efkct on working 
life at Yale. 

Chuck Paul, 
Yale's 
Director of Total 
Compensation, says that 
Project X has empowered 
individual employees and rid 
the University of long trails 
of paper. 

According to Brian Tunney, 
Director of Labor Relations for the 
University, the transition co Project X has 
constituted a near non-issue for Yale's 
workforce. Tunney explains that Project X 
has not caused intimidation or lost jobs; 
rather, Yale now employs over 200 more 
full-time workers than it did prior to the 
Oracle overhaul. Of the University's 
upcoming contract renegotiations with 
Locals 34 and 35, Tunney added that 
Project X would almost certainly not be an 
issue. 

At the same time, some of Yale's work-
force say they have yet to see the wonderful 
advances promised by Project X. Eighteen 
months after Oracle went live, some of 
Yale's clerical and technical workers are dis-
satisfied-a frivolous response, according 
to their higher-ups. The reasons behind 
their dissatisfaction extend back to the ear-
liest announcements of Project X, but also, 
in a sense, to before such things as web-
based financial accounting systems existed.
