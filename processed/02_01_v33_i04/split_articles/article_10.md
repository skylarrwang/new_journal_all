Disgruntled 
WT MONTH-January 12 to be exact-1 
turned 20. It was the saddest birthday of 
my life. As I turned the key in box 200857 
in Yale Station Post Office, I imagined 
cakes and balJoons and cards stuffed far 
with cash tumbling out at my feet. 

Nothing. Not from Mom, not from 
Grandma, not from anyone. In disbelief, I 
Stretched my arm through the box. There 
must have been a mistake, I told mysel£ 
Somebody must love me. 
Perhaps my 
cards were in the box below. Dislocating 
my shoulder in the process, I reached 
200957. Nothing. I reached above, but 
still I found only the cold, gray steel of 
another box as empty as my own. Again I 
peered through, resigned and sad. To my 
surprise, I came face to f.ace with a man 
Who understood my pain. 

Larry (he requests that his real name 
not be used) looks like the stereotypical 
postal worker: nearing middle age, stocky, 
dressed in blue jeans and a sweatshirt. But 
Larry is something more: Beneath his 
Postman Joe fas:ade I found a civil servant 
dedicated to the proposition that all postal 
customers are created equal. He smoked a 
cigarette as he consoled me outside 
Lanman-Wright. "It's shame"fUJ," he says of 
the delays that plague Yale Station. 
"They're treating you like second-class citi-
uns. Something ought to be done. You 
see that poster over there, with the phone 
number on it?" He's posrered every kiosk 
on campus with the number of the New 
Haven Postmaster, hoping for students to 
lodge their complaints. "I know you guys 
have problems like this," he explains, allud-
ing to the common complaints from dis-
gruntled Yale Station customers about late-
ness, lost packages, and rude employees. 
"You ought to give that number a call." 

My sadness turned to ire. Ready to take a 
stand for my rights, I made the call. 

Lavinia, the clerk who answered, took 
my name and box number and said I'd be 
hearing from the postmaster shortly. 
When I persisted with my inquiries, she 
directed me to Christine Dugas, the Post 
Office's 
Communications 
Program 
Specialist 
for 
Public 
Affairs 
and 
Communications in the Northeast. 
I 
phoned her office in Providence, Rhode 
Island, but no one picked up. 

I returned to Yale Station, humming 
"Happy Birthday" to myself in languid, 
self-pitying strains. 
I found Larry, who 
once again buoyed my sagging spirits. It 
wasn't me, he promised. It was the system. 
I tried to tell him that the cards weren't ever 
going to come. He could see I was desper-
ate, and being a man of conviction he knew 
he'd have to prove his point. Punching the 
security code into the door, we made our 
way behind the boxes. All this was "ille-
gal," Larry explained, "but OK, cause you're 
with me." 

Packages in carrs and white plastic 
boxes filled with letters were stacked waist 
high, covering most of the floor. 
Still, 
something was missing: people.

He points to the cards in my hands, all

mark never lies." 

back here. I can't hi~ every box every day." 

Larry directed me next to John 
Dinius, president of the local chapter of 
the Associated Postal Workers Union. He 
effused a patriotic vigor similar to Larry's 
own. "We're here to provide a universal ser-
vice to America," Dinius explained. "[Yale 
Station] is part of America, but you guys 
aren't being served." His explanation was 
simple: "The problems at Yale Station are 
due 100 percent to understaffing. At one 
time we had 18 people there. [Since 1993], 
our levels have dropped from 18 down to 15 
then to 13 and now to the present ten. It's 
like trying to move ten pounds of sand 
with two people instead of ten people. 
Until we have more bodies back there, 
there are going to be delays, plain and sim-
ple." 

When I finally reached Communica-
tions Program Specialist for Public Affairs 
and Communications Dugas, she took a 
different tone. The faceless bureaucrat in 
Providence, she had no sympathy for my 
lack of birthday joy. 
She corrected me 
when I spoke of delayed mail. 
"You're 
assuming delayed delivery to be a face," she 
said. "Our studies show that for the State 
of Connecticut and for New Haven and 
Yale Station in particular, we have an on-
time delivery rate of 95 percent, which is 
above our national goal of 93 percent." 
Dugas admitted that the Yale St2tion work-
force had been "streamlined" in the past; 
but, she explained, "We feel we are provid-
ing our customers with the services they
