Grumpy Old Men 
At first glance, the 85-year-old members of 
the Oass of 1937 don't look like rabble-
rousers. Twenty-five years after their gradu-
ation, 88 percent were happily married, 85 
percent were regular churchgoers, and 71 
percent were registered Republicans; they 
believed in fighting for their country, own-
ing rwo cars, and the fact that they would 
be bald in ten years. By 1999, not much 
had changed. But in October of that year, 
the Class of 1937 took up arms against its 
alma mater. Why are these rebels not the 
peacefully retired grandfathers they seemed 
destined to become? 

The 
answer: 
"Phelpsgate." 
In 
September 1999, several hundred copies of 
Yale's conservative student publication 
Light & Truth were removed from freshman 
mailboxes. Playing off juicy allegations of 
illegal acts by Yale's freshman counselors 
and an administration cover-up, the name 
has stuck. As the furor died down and the 
administration rejected L&T s grievance 
petition, it soon seemed as if everyone had 
forgotten. However, "Pbdpsgate" had just 
begun to captivate the minds of the men of 
the Class of 1937. Sixty-rwo years away 
from Yale had done nothing to dampen 
their fervor or their memory. They were 
old, but not too old to take on the system. 

One 38-page report, a flurry of corre-
spondence, and a year and a half later, the 
Class of 1937 is still standing firm. 

Although some in their ranks are as tired of 
the issue as most students, others are sriU 
bandying about terms like "pc Police" and 
specularing about freshman counselor "spy 
networks" run out of Dean Trachtenberg's 
office. According to a former L&T staff 
member, the magazine and the alumni 
soon found a murually agreeable division 
of labor in the fight: "We [L&T] provided 
the informacion, and they fought the bat-
tles for us." Though unsuccessful in help-
ing the editors receive compensation for 
damages or having "formal sanctions" 
brought against the implicated freshman 
counselors and administ.ratots, the alumni 
still seem determined to fight to the death. 

The Class that Levin has called "Yale's most 
devoted" has filed a petition with the AYA 
and is calling for a review of the 
University's free speech regulations. 

"As members of the Class of 1937, we 
are old," said corresponding secretary John 
W. Field. "We believe in tradition and free-
dom ... [and] we love Yale." On the sur-
face, the Class of 1937 perceived a threat to 
intellecrual freedom on campus, especially 
for conservative views. However, their 
actions betray a deeper fear that, as the 
years go by, the administration is forgetting 
the Old Yale. The decline of conservative 
groups, which they see as one of the last 
bastions of this spirit on campus, is pacric-
ularly worrisome to men who may not be 
around to defend the Yale they love much 
longer. By not punishing those involved in 
confiscating L&T, it seemed as if 
University officials were not only attacking 
the rights of a conservative publication to 
challenge the administration, but the val-
ues and rights of her own alumni as well. 

"[W]e had a grand rime here together 
and we now march out and sit on the side-
lines and exercise our almost divine right to 
grumble at the changes that will doubtless 
begin the instant our backs are rumed: 
former Yale president James Rowland 
Angell wrote in the History of th~ C/as:s t/ 
I9JJ. "[O]r we might make the class of 193" 
completely immortal."
