IN THE LAST YEAR, some local Democrats have noticed a change in the mayor. " He became more charismatic, more popular, more responsive, Alderman Julio Gonzalez said last fall, before he joined the mayor's campaign. "I really feel there has been a change in the tone of the administration. 

Gonzalez is not alone in his newfound enthusiasm for the DeStefano administration. The race for the nomination has not only split the Democratic party, but has also strengthened the convictions of each veteran of New Haven politics, but a young graduate of Yale Law School named Henry Fernandez.

Supporters seem to think DeStefano has broken free of his debts to the party that got him the job. "When you first get elected there's a tendency to bring in the people who brought you to the dance," DeStefano admits. But the general feeling in New Haven is that the Democratic Party does not work the way it used to. If the mayor can convince New Haven that he is the one responsible for turning an oligarchy into a meritocracy, he will be mayor again next year.

Local leaders who had previously shown lukewarm support for the mayor are preparing to actively campaign for him. Bill Dyson, who represents New Haven in the Connecticut Assembly, will support DeStefano because, in his opinion, the Looney camp has offered no agenda, while DeStefano has "made a vast improvement."

The mayor is hesitant to say that he has changed significantly in the last year-that would be an admission that his first six years were much less productive and energetic. But he knows he learned something from Jim Newton's strong showing in 1999: "Two years ago voters sent me a message [that] they were concerned with city government," he says of the last election.

Gonzalez and Dyson attribute the mayor's new attitude to his rift with Democratic leaders like Balletto. As Dyson explains, "[DeStefano) is slowly but surely surrounding himself with people that he trusts." Indeed, the people surrounding each candidate have become as much of an issue in this campaign as the candidates themselves. During his first six years in office, it seemed that DeStefano could not avoid scandal. He managed to come through nearly unscathed each time, while members of his administration took the fall. In the process, the look of City Hall has changed. Chief Administrative Officer Jim Horan had not lived in New Haven prior to working for the mayor. The head of economic development is no longer a member of the Democratic machine. "Rewarding friends in the city is something [the old party bosses) did well," says Robin Kroogman, an alderwoman who will likely support Looney. She faults the mayor for hiring staffers from outside the city, pointing to Fernandez, Horan, and parks director Robert Levine, who moved from Virginia to New Haven to take the job.

DeStefano's supporters believe that the mayor's administration has found the necessary balance between the reformer, grassroots liberals, and the traditional, Party-oriented Democrats. "On the one hand, the mayor gets criticized for working with Party regulars; on the other, he's criticized for not working with them," Nemerson says. "If you study urban policies in America, all of the successful mayors ... present themselves as reformers who are going to do things in a market-based way, while cutting as many deals as they can."

While it might not seem right, patronage always has and probably always will play some role in New Haven politics. It's a part of the DeStefano administration, but it would surely be a part of the Looney administration as well.

In fact, the Looney team features many former players from DeStefano's City
