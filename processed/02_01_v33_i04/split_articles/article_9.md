Pool Ties 
ON jANUARY 13, Jeff Jannuzzo-25-year 
member and self-professed lover of New 
York's Yale Club "in all her diversity"-
threarened litigation against that venerated 
institution. Citing New York Nor-for-
Profit Corporation Law Section 621, he 
called for Club President Peter Wells to 
provide him with a list of rhe Club's voting 
members within five days. "The lisr is 
demanded," wrote Jannuzzo, "for an object 
relating to the business of rhe Club, name-
ly ro communicate with the members as to 
whether there shall be any changes to the 
Club's fifth floor swimming pool." Failure 
ro deliver the list, he wrote, could send the 
issue ro the Stare Supreme Court. 

The trouble began last summer. In 
mid-July, the Yale Club Council distrib-
uted surveys to members to determine the 
popularity of certain facilities. The Club's 
petite, 85-year-old swimming pool-maxi-
mum occupancy, three lane swimmers, and 
monthly usage, 30o-was among the facil-
ities in question. Its inclusion raised some 
eyebrows among a contingent of 50 or so 
swimmers in the Club, Jannuzzo included, 
who instantly began to suspect foul play. 
"We began exchanging letters and e-mails 
with people in rhe Club governance," 
Jannuzzo explained over the phone, "to say, 
like, 'What is going on and can you assure 
us that you're not going ro be closing this 
place?' and not getting satisfactory 
answers." The pool, with its handmade 
mosaic tiles, solid brass railings, and three 
lion's head fountains (allegedly the work of 
a foundry used by sculptor Henry Moore), 
appeals to many swimmers because of its 
old-fashioned feel. The pool's rumored 
"Roman bath" tradition of harbouring 
nude and inebriated swimmers in the old 
days may also provide some nostalgic 
charm. 

After questioning some members of 
the Club's Athletic Committee in early fall, 
the swimmers received the bad news. The 
demolition of their prized pool, they 
learned, was being considered in a pro-
posed renovation and expansion of the 
women's locker room and the aerobic facil-
ities. So the swimmers began ro organize 
and agitate. "We used to go [to the pool] 
and hang out," said Jannuzzo, "and say, 
'Hey, did you hear they're thinking of clos-
ing the pool?"' One of the swimmers pro-
cured the e-mail address savethepool@aol. 
com, and then things began ro roll. A few of 
the pool activists contacted The New York 
Times-coincidentally, their employer-
which published a fluff piece about the 
pool on November 5· Before long, in what 
seemed ro resemble an authentic move-
ment, the group began meeting on 
Saturday nights to strategize. "The people 
in the elected officership part of the Club 
have really been, just, you know, amazed," 
said Jannuzzo, who became both the Save-
the-Pool group's chairman and secretary. 
"People have grumbled before about the 
way things have changed, but no one's 
accually organized." 

Then Jannuzzo's troops hit the front 
lines. Ar a January 13 meeting, they voted 
on a "two-prong plan of political action 
and diplomacy." While Jannuzzo sent his 
fiery missive to President Wells, demanding 
the names and addresses of the Club's vot-
ing members for a "Save the Pool" mailing 
drive, others pressed members of the 
Council by phone on how the Club 
planned to get members' comments prior 
ro construction. Meanwhile, certain mem-
bers had been hard at work creating 
www.savethepool.com, where one can peruse 
detailed minutes from the meetings, news 
from the front, heartbreaking quotations 
("Without the pool the athletic facilities 
will be like any others in town. I'll cancel 
my athletic membership in a heartbeat if 
this plan goes forward"), and even the 
instrumental New York Times article. 

Peter Wells has been a bit dumb-
founded. "One of the things that has char-
acterized this Save-the-Pool group is they 
like to make a lor of noise based on no 
facts," he explained. Vice President Tom 
Fiffer responded by e-mail to Jannuzzo's 
early demand letter, "I am frankly aston-
ished at the degree to which your commit-
tee is and has been relying on rumors-as 
opposed ro seeking our facts .... " (This is 
the same Tom Fiffer, by the way, who, in a 
prelude to the pool affair, last May tem-
porarily suspended Club member Tad l:.ow, 
co-creator ofVH1's Pop-Up Video, for hurl-
ing cauliflower florets and cheese cubes at 
the Whiffenpoofs during a concert.) Wells 
insists that the Council never planned to 
scrap the pool, but has merely tossed 
around the idea as one possibility for the 
summer renovations. The council is also 
considering demolishing one of the Club's 
four squash courts. "There is a small, dedi-
cated group of people that don't want that 
to happen," said Wells, "and we will hea~; 
from them as well." 

For Jannuzzo and his chums, there's 
much more at stake than an antique, 32-by-
18 foot pool. Many view the pool contro-
versy as just one symptom of the Yale 
Club's widespread decline inro kitsch and 
profitability. Along with the recent prolifer-
ation of "cheap Holiday Inn furnirure" in 
the lobby, according to activist Peter Rose, 
members 
watched 
the 
Club 
allow 
University of Virginia graduates to join in 
1996, following decisions many years ago £O 
welcome Dartmouth alumni and oKL 
brothers too. "(The Yale Club] is a place 
that we give a damn about," said Jannuzzo. 
"and that we want to make sure nobody 
tries to rurn into a place where they charge 
you for the towels and think of new ways to 
get your money, and come and go out of 
business with the whims of fashion and 
notions of what is cool." Some find the 
Club Council's increasing aloofness and' 
secrecy "fascistic." "I think this dub is 
experiencing a leadership problem at the 
moment," said Rose, who alleges that he's 
never been offered a chance to vote for a 
council member in his 25 years at the Club. 
"They've told employees not to talk about 
the pool-a lifeguard who works at the 
pool was reprimanded for tallcing to mem-
bers." 

Bur are the pool supporters of the 
NYC Yale Club really entitled ro the demo-
cratic process they seek? The Club, after alJ, 
is not only private, but also restricted ro 
those willing to shell out $1,500 a year, 
martinis not included. Jannuzzo and his 
marginalized swimmers srill seem co think 
they're owed some sort of voice. Peter Wells 
recently handed over the Club membership 
list, and the Save-the-Pool group plans to 
lobby for a general vote. Within those com-
fortable environs, a leather-armchair revo-
lution is brewing.
