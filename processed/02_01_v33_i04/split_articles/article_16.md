EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Hall. For example, Patti Cofrancesco, formerly a top city lawyer, was fired by the 
mayor after signing off on questionable city 
loans to another city employee, Andrea 
Jackson-Brooks. Now, Jackson-Brooks is 
on the Board of Aldermen, Cofrancesco 
practices law in New Haven, and both are 
expected to support Looney. 

Why would Looney, who has usually 
been known as a reformer, join the Party 
team? His first job in city government was 
as aide to Mayor Frank Logue, a non-
machine candidate in the 1970s. Martin 
Looney has had his eye on City Hall for a 
long time, and the rift in local Democratic 
leadership might give him the best opportunity anyone 
has 
had 
to 
unseat 
DeStefano. "[Looney] is a good guy with a 
clean record who's right on state issues," 
Gonzalez says. "I just don't see how he 
could govern without appeasing that 
[Party] base." 

MAYOR DESTEFANO THINKS voters don't 
care about political maneuvering—they 
want the soccer fields mowed and the 
schools improved. "When you've got an 
incumbent, [the voters] are going to look 
and say, 'Am I satisfied or not?'" In his 
opinion, the people of New Haven are better 
off now than they were before he 
became mayor. "There's no doubt that 
New Haven is a more confident place than 
it was a year ago." 

The mayor is right about most voters: 
They don't care about politics, who's running 
whose campaign, and who's supporting 
whom. They will decide the election 
based on how their lives are right now, and 
they care about schools, parks, and policing. But they also want a City Hall free of 
debts to political bosses and corporate 
donors—something neither DeStefano nor 
Looney can promise.
