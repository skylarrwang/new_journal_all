"OuR MISSION IS TO GET HERE and work 
hard for two, three, four years and then to 
return home," Carlos explains to me. "All 
my family is in Medellin, and I want to go 
back .... " He trails off and looks at a pho-
tograph of an Andean village on the wall. 

Diosa tells me that be, too, came to 
the u.s with the intention of going back 
home to his f.unily and friends, but son,.e-
wbere along the way, his plan changed. He 
came from Colombia 25 years ago. He had 
obtained a temporary tourist visa by slip-
ping a corrupt Colombian official $4,000 
under the table, and he didn't return home 
after the visa expired. "When I came here, 
I told my f.unily that I was going to work 
for a year and then come back. I starred 
working. I washed dishes. I was like a 
gypsy," he recounts. "Then Ia migra want-
ed to deport me, so I married an American 
lady, and we had rwo kids, and we still live 
together." Diosa is now a prominent and 
well-connected figure in the immigrant 
community. Still, he doesn't romanticize 
the story. "For most of the people involved, 
marriage is just a business." 

The ikgales come with the plan of 
making some money and then going back 
home. They focus on the task at hand, try 
ro stay our of trouble, work hard, follow 
the jobs and whatever friends and f.unily 
may be in El Norte as well. Somehow, in 
walking this difficult course, the original 
intention of going home gees lost. The 
quest to return home is supplanted by the 
quest ro obtain papers. "The mission 
becomes to get documentS, to marry an 
American," Carlos continues. Diosa mar-
ter-of-factly describes the course of his and 
his friends' lives in El Nom. "You say you're 
going to come back, but when you start 
you don't know what will really happen 
because you don't know where you're 
going. People come here, and they try to 
get married or become legal some way. 
They don't go back. They stay here." 

In 
the 
mountains of Western 
Honduras, wives anticipate their husbands' 
returns and children wait to meet their 
fathers for the first time. They continue 
hoping, while the ilegales continue down a 
path of no return. And as soon as each 
fatherless boy is old enough, the f.unily 
takes itS savings, contactS the coyote, and 
sends another to El Nom. -
