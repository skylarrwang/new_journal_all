I don't like doing it. But course packets are expensive these days. I tried getting money the old-fashioned 
-
way, but a part-time job on top of everything else? Who needs the extra stress and who really has the 
time? No, I may not like it, but it's good, fast, honest money. My friends think I'm crazy and a little sick. I 
can't even tell my parents. But it doesn't matter what they all think anyway-it's my body, and I'll do with it 
as I please. So I just lie back, close my eyes, try to relax, and hope it doesn't hun too much. When those twen-
ty-dollar bills get flipped into my hand, it all seems worthwhile. 

.. 
Everybody wants it, everybody needs it, but how fur would you go for an easy buck? What services would 
you be willing co provide? And are you an 18-28-year-old non-smoker available for a 45-minute perception test in 
exchange for eight dollars? I am, and I'll gladly do more than that. You can make a career out of being a science 
whore if you play your cards right. 

Sure, lots of people dabble in the small stuff: the periodic psych freebie, the five-dollar survey, maybe a ten-
dollar dexterity test. You run into the occasional MRI that pays a cool $50, but most people keep it simple. There 
are, however, a few of us out there--the estrogen-injecting, electrically-shocked, drug-testing, egg-donating few-
who are willing 'tO risk permanent bodily harm in exchange for some hard cash. The more dangerous, the more 
scarring, the better the pay. 

It took 20 minutes to get there by bus. All the best gigs are usually some distance from campus. They like 
to call you in twice, the first time to size you up, test you, see if you are what they're looking for. You get $30 just 
for that. Then you come back a week later for the actual experiment. 

On my return visit, I was nervous, still f.Urly new to the business. I walked into the office, my palms sweat-
ing, smiling nervously. The man sitting inside seemed nice enough. I was lucky; you can run into some pretty creepy 
people at these things, but this guy was even kind of cute. I settled down to read the contract. I was there to test 
the "effects ofMGLUIUAGONIST (LY354740) vs. Placebo in the Fear Potentiated Startle Paradigm." I would be test-
ing an anti-anxiety drug to see how it affected my reflexes and emotions. 

The experiment began with two large white pills, then two more an hour later. I was left in a cubicle to allow 
the drug to sink in. In the cubicle next to me a man was testing what I understood to be a controlled form of an 
otherwise-illicit substance. I spent the next two hours doing homework and listening to him mumble to himself. 
A doctor came in every half-hour to ask how he felt and if he heard the voices of God or the Devil. By the time I 
left, no divine beings had spoken to him, but he had apparently held a moving conversation with his left foot. 

Even after the drugs in my system had made me a bit dizzy and I had been assaulted by a nurse thirsty for eight 
tubes of blood, I remained f.Urly confident about the experiment ... until the administrator started taping wires to 
my face and wrist. She stuck rwo detectors just below my left eye co record my reflex response to electric shocks 
administered to the inside of my left wrist by two wires. I was guaranteed at least one and up to three shocks described 
by past subjects as "very unpleasant." The administrator assured me that it wouldn't be any worse than a shock from an 
electrical outlet. If this was meant to calm me, it didn't. All I could think about was the last time I was shocked by an 
electrical outlet-my arm tingled for two hours and it took another rwo to get the hair on my arms to lie flat again. 

Selling your body to science can be a scary business. You don't always know exactly what you're getting yourself into, 
and you can unwittingly get sucked into some pretty serious stuff. You draw the line--"That's as far as I'll go" -then 
you slowly cross it and redraw it over and over again. Before you know it, you're bald, numb, or going through tempo-
rary menopause at age 21. For LY354740 they subjected me to pregnancy tests for three months; it had been deemed a safe 
enough drug for me, but whether it could give gills to my unborn children is yet to be determined. You can't let things like 
that bother you too much, though. You survive on gut instinct. If a situation seems dangerous, you stay away from it. 
It's when you let them push you around that you can get into trouble. But if you don't mind shon bouts of discomfon 
and nausea, pee into this cup and initial pages 3-7. You'll be compensated upon completion of the experiment.
