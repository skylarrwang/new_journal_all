HE WESTERN HONDURAN LANDSCAPE IS BLANKETED with cloud-forest and dotted with tiny 
Indian villages. In every town, something is missing: There are almost no men between the 
ages of 18 and 35· Everywhere, the explanation for their absence is the same: They have left for EL 
Nort~. 

The sprawling, loose-knit, Honduran family from whom r rented a room last summer was 
typical. Three sisters and their children lived together in a house; their husbands and eldest sons 
were already gone, expected to return at some unspecified point in the future. The oldest male 
left in the household was Francisco, and though he was only twelve, he was already talking about 
his own upcoming journey. When I asked him how men get through Guatemala and Mexico and 
over the border into the u.s., he responded nonchalandy, "You go visit the coyote." It is a sim-
ple business transaction. You pay the coyote and he delivers you co EL Nort~. If the first attempt 
fails, you go again and again until you've made it. The whole thing sounded impossibly easy. 

Honduras, the second poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, has been devastated, like 
much of Central America, by successive hu~ricanes and floods in the past two years. The poor 
own no land and have little opportunity to find work. In areas heavily populated by Indians, 
unemployment pushes 50 percent. The only option is to head north. Still, it is startling to see the 
magnitude of the flight reflected in what is left behind: entire families without a single male fig-
ure, children who have never met their fathers, mothers who haven't seen their sons in decades. 

All are awaiting the return of some long-departed relative whose memory takes on a shadowy, 
mythic stature in letters, memories, and anecdotes. 

One day, I met the coyote. Jaime wore a red flannel shirt and sported a long black ponytail. 
He listened to Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones and had once played in a rock-and-roll band. 
He showed off the few Engltsh phrases that he knew ("Jou are very bee-oo-ty-ful"), and togeth-
er we sang the first verse of "Black Dog." When I brought up immigration, he grinned drunk-
enly, revealing a missing front tooth. But he evaded my questions. How much does he chacge? 
Depends. $2,ooo, $3,000, maybe more. How does he get people to El Norte? Depends. Truck, 
bus, maybe plane. How do his clients cross the border? Depends. Through the river, over the 
fence, hidden in the trunk of a car or the back of a truck. Jaime, however, was emphatic on one 
point: Getting to the u.s. is easy and certain, despite Ia migra (a moniker for the border police 
used on both sides of the Rio Grande). "We are," be said in Spanish, "like the barbarians invad-
ing Rome." 


THE U.S. CURRENTLY HAS A HIGHER PROPORTION OF IMMIGRANTS 
than at any other time in the past hundred years. Scill, New 
Haven-thousands of miles from the border, lacking any major 
industry or agriculture--seems an unlikely place to come across 
undocumented workers. I hardly expected to find anyone in this 
smaJl, northeastern city who had completed the long, dangerous 
journey from Latin America. I decided to look anyway-and what 
I found was an entire underground community of ilegales a short 
walk away from the Yale campus. 

I just had to head southeast on Elm Street, past the Green, and 
through downtown. When Elm became Grand Avenue, I continued 
under 1-91 and crossed over the train tracks into Fair Haven. 
Suddenly, the signs were in Spanish-Lujo's Librerfa, El CanquC 
Restaurante, Lujinera Caribera-and Spanish graffiti ragged fences 
and storefronts. 

Fair Haven has been the center of New Haven's Puerto Rican 
population for decades. Recently, a new crowd has come to the 
neighborhood: the ilegales, undocumented immigrants from 
Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, and a host of other Larin American 
countries. Signs on storefronts read "No loitering-Police rake 
notice" (or somcthin~ in Spanish), but the measure hac~ 
seems necessary. Though it is a-sunny Sarurday afternoon, few peo-
ple are out in the streets. Grand old wood-plank houses line the 
streets, their large porches pushing almost to the sidewalk. Some of 
~e houses show signs of careful attention, freshly painted in blues 
and pinks, with small fences and Christmas decorations. But every 
block also has houses that have f.illen into disrepair. Their windows 
are boarded up, their ancient paint-jobs flaked almost off, their 
porches caved in at 45 degree angles. Some of the most decrepit ones 
show the smallest signs of habitation: broken windows covered with 
newspaper, a makeshifr mailbox propped against a porch column. 

Though the streets are mostly empty, I occasionally see some-
one walking hurriedly, eyes down, into a house, or a small group of 
men standing on a street-corner. But whenever I approach them, 
they eye me suspiciously and move away. Finally, I see a woman 
watching me from the other side of the street, and I ask her, in 
Spanish, if people live in these houses. She shrugs. "Only ws ilegales." 

Last summer, Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) 
agents raided a condemned house on Cedar Hill Avenue and found 
35 undocumented workers living there. At the time, the INS report-
ed knowledge of at least eight such hovels around New Haven, each 
of which housed two or three dozen immigrants. According to 
Hernando Diosa, a prominent journalist and radio personality in 
the local Latino community, houses for ilegales still abound in Fair 
Haven and a number of ocher local neighborhoods. "I know a 
house where 40 or 50 people live. There are only three bedrooms. 
People sleep in the hallways, on newspapers on the floors." Afrer the 
ilegales cleared out of the Cedar HiH Avenue house, authorities dis-
covered feces littering the basement and a chimney that was on the 
verge of collapse. 

In recent years, Diosa says, Fair Haven has been flooded with 
new 
immigrants-" Mexicans, 
Guatemalans, 
Salvadorans, 
Peruvians, Hondurans, Colombians, all groups." Latinos are the 
fastest-growing segment of New Haven's population. The official 
community now numbers almost 25,000, 50 percent larger than it 
was ten years ago. It is hard to say just how many more are undoc-
umented. "The people are scared, some of them are even afraid of 
me because they think I'm Ia migra," Diosa tells me. "But there are 
at least 5,000 ilegales in New Haven." 

CARLos PASSES ME A DRINK AND SITS DOWN AT THE TABLE, where I 
am chatting with a man who calls himself Sigi. The two ilegales are
