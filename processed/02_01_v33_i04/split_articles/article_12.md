t's hard to believe, but an entire economic era has come and gone since I 
entered Yale in the fall of 1998. Sky-high technology stocks sent the Nasdaq up 
86 percent in 1999, its best year since its inception 29 years ago, and created a mood 
of unparalleled economic exuberance from Silicon Valley to Silicon Alley. In the 
process, a new American hero was born: the 22-year-old gazillionaire computer whi2 
with his own e-business scarrup. Across the nation, thousands of humanities majors 
began to wonder whether they should be studying Java instead of John Milton. 
But as the media have recently noted with barely concealed glee, the bubble has most 
certainly burst. The Nasdaq saw its worst ever losses, 40 percent, in 2000, due primarily to 
rbe failure of Internet stocks. Nearly 36,000 technology workers have lost their jobs. Last 
January, Jj)e-companies bought airtime during the Super Bowl; this year, only four did. No one 
has yet dared to breathe the word "recession," but Alan Greenspan did admit last month that the 
economy was at a "standstill." 
The heady dot-com era has not passed entirely, however. One legacy is the dream of the dorm-
room entrepreneur-the dream that a kid barely out of high school could create a successful busi-
ness plan and be taken seriously by real investors with real money. To hear them talk, Yale's srudenr


entrepreneurs are just getting srarted and are poised to lead them-
