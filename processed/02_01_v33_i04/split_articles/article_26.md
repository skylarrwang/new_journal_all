EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
up the cello after he saw Yo-Yo Ma play and 
realized he would never share his passion 
for the instrument. 
Th~ SokJist begins: 
"This morning I read an article suggesting 
that Saint Theresa of Avila, a sixteenth-cen-
tury Spanish mystic noted for her ecstatic 
visions, suffered from a neurological disor-
der known to cause hallucinations." 

So, it appears, Salzman had been 
brooding over Sister John's dilemma long 
before he brought her character into 
being-his protagonist's spiritual crisis 
seems co bear an affinity not only co his 
own musical struggles but also to his Liter-
ary struggles. Lying Awalt~ emerged from 
nearly six years of self-doubt, and Salz.nian 
completed the novel only after retreating to 
a writer's colony, where, as he cold Th~ N~ 
Yorker, "I was in a community of people 
who seemed dedicated to art almost like a 
sacred pursuit. And the irony was not lost 
on me chat I was now living essentially like 
a Carmelite nun." 

Perhaps this proximity of religious and 
artistic yearning underlies Salzman's ability 
to move even the most skeptical of readers. 
To be sure, Salzman periodically stumbles 
into cliches, especially when describing 
Sister John's visions; of one epiphany, he 
writes, "[e)very moment, every breath was 
poetry." And some of his descriptions-
Sister John f.illing "upward into brilliance," 
for example--are too strenuously lyric. 

Perhaps Salzman should not have tried to 
express the inexpressible, for he does much 
bener with yearning than fulfillment, with 
doubt than with certainty. 

But these shortcomings do not signifi-
cantly detract from his spare, elegant novel.

Salzman makes Sister John's character com-
pelling and her struggle with faith 
poignant, nor sanctimonious. This bal-
anced treatment of the story's protagonist 
finds a formal counterpart in Salzman's 
narrative style: He intersperses a prose plot 
with poetic gestures of prayer, so char read-
ers are ar once a part of Sister John's outside 
world and her innermost rhoughrs. 

The greatest achievements of Lying 
Awak~ are the humility and anemion co 
detail that animate the novel. Saltman 
writes about daily life in the monastery, 
rather chan focusing on extraordinary 
eventS. In fact, it is not the religious 
momentS, in any traditional sense, rhat are 
most touching, but rather the more mun-
dane struggles of women who have chosen 
J co give up "television, radios, newspapers, 
movies, fashion, [and) men" to commune 
with an impalpable God. 

Salzman writes that in "the spiritual 
life, individual success often came at the 
expense of community harmony," and 
rather than gloss over the human emotions 
and relationships of the sisters, he records 
both the secular and the deeply religious 
aspects of life at the monastery. For exam-
ple, the sisters discuss breakfast juices with 
both religious conviction and personal 
preference, and they feel a mix of awe and 
envy when Sister John achieves poetic 
fame. The everyday motions of the sisters 
convince readers not only of their faith, bur 
also their individuality. The~e are nor 
cookie-cuner nuns. 

Sister John's interactions wirh her doc-
tor are also compelling, because Salzman 
sucessfully resists caricaturing either indi-

vidual. The doctor is nor a mere represen-
tative of secular moderniry, nor is Sister 
John a two-dimensional embodiment of 
piety. AJrhough they often speak to each 
ocher on seemingly separate planes of exis-
tence--her "Peace be with you, Doctor" 
receives an empty "Have a great day" in 
response-the smaller momentS of connec-
tion between them reveal Salzman's fine 
characterization and the judiciousness of 
his novel. Near the end of the novel, the 
doctor turns to discard a pair of surgical 
scissors he has used only once, and Sister 
John asks if she can have it for the 
monastery. During her next visit, he gives 
her a box full of scissors. This moment 
could easily become sentimental and con-
trived, but the doctor's comment, "Now 
you and your Sisters won't have to fight 
over that other one," reflects both his pro-
fessionalism and his nervous compassion. 

Ultimately, it is the daily life of the 
monastery and the sisters' interactions with 
the ourside world that impress the reader 
with genuine spirituality. And it is the 
poised balance Salzman maintains between 
faith and science throughout the novel that 
makes this meditation succeed in irs con-
templation of two seemingly irreconcilable 
creeds.
