fun perk. "Very, very seldom do I see more than maybe ten
regulars," says Mark, "And that's scary."

On Thursday night, the kings of New Haven night-
life preside over the city's dance floors. Nobody cares. A
drunk girl gyrates with overt sexuality, balancing a vodka
cranberry in one hand as she sways the other above her
head, cocked in a come-hither manner. Her lips don't miss
a word to a song she has heard a thousand times.
Despite the generous array of clubs on Crown, every-
one knows which two spots are always packed, the kind of
crowded that causes ladies to link arms and guys to sling a

finger through their girlfriends' belt loops. In a city
fueled by nightclub glitz, Bar and Alchemy will never
close.
The latter, a sprawling, three-level oasis of alco-
hol, loud music, and strategic lighting cues, boasts
the biggest dance floor in Connecticut. It is as close
as New Haven gets to a standard New York party
club which is to say, not close enough.
High above the sweaty crowd is DJ Robert
LaFrance, Joe's colleague. Illuminated by a single strand


of Christmas lights and the greenish glow of his equipment,
he looks like a mad scientist. His hands move quickly, skill-
fully, arranging an endless layered mix of pop hits. When
he spins around to flip a light switch, a siren goes off and the
crowd goes crazy. "My thing is really House music. [This]
is kind of cheesy," he says of the Billboard hip-hop play list
he is asked to play in the main room. "But I'm okay with
that." DJ Rob is not here to educate, but to entertain.
On the upper level of Alchemy is Lounge 215, a 21+
area posing as a V.I.P. room. It has its own bar and boasts a
buffet of silver banquet dishes offering rubbery munchies.
DJ Joe is there playing House music.
To the pop-listener, the sound is distorted and exotic.
A descendant of disco, House music is electric, tripped-
out, and airy, with a four-by-four pulse and driving
bassline designed to keep the body in motion. Accord-
ing to DJ Rob, House music generates "a feeling that you
can't really describe."
If Alchemy aspires to resemble a crowded Paris disco-
theque, then Bar recalls a jammed Dublin pub. Surrounded
by mahogany, exposed brick accents, beer garden-style seat-
ing, and an antique pool table, people relax and drink beer.
Originally opened as a nightclub in 1991, Bar successfully
added pizza ovens and a rnicrobrewery in the rnid-'90s. On
this particular Thursday there is hardly enough elbow room
to bring cup to mouth.
Depending on your vibe, you may avoid or gravi-
tate towards Bar's back room, where DJ Mark supervises
a smattering of people on the dance floor below. Of the
quarter of the club-goers lounging in the back room, may-
be a twentieth are dancing. Compared to the main room
at Alchemy, this is tame.
After the hip-hop DJ winds down at the end of Thurs-
day night, Mark begins a House set. The scant dance floor
quickly clears. "(Last] night I was called a fucking asshole
ten times in the booth," he says, not altogether unhap-
PY· Even if he is insulted, these are the moments when
Mark stood out and was noticed for what he loves:
playing House. He and Joe are throwbacks to when be-
ing a DJ mattered.
I
n 1964, nightclubs were about the music. "Going
out" implied dances, sipped cocktails, and artful
seduction. At discotheques, clubgoers went over the
rainbow on LSD and danced the monkey, the frug,
and Watusi until the harsh sun rose over Battery Park.
In May 1965, "discotheque" appeared in "Among the
New Words," an article in the linguistic journal Ameri-
can Speech. Five years later, the dazzling, decadent
heyday of disco began. In New York, the conductor of
this movement was not a club proprietor, musical artist,
or celebrity. He was a DJ: Francis Grasso, presented by
the city with blow jobs and blow.
Even ninety miles away in New Haven, the scene
was "pretty intense," recalls Chris Arnott, Arts Edi-
tor for the New Haven Advocate. "There were disco-
theques that were a really big deal... the city had a claim
to some real stuff."
But Joe and Mark grew up on a new sound that
had its roots in 1980s Chicago. There, at a club called
The Warehouse, House music was corning into its own.
The vibrations hit the Big Apple overnight. As young
men, Joe and Mark frolicked at notorious NYC hot-
spots like Paradise Garage and the original Sound Fac-
tory. Mark began DJing in 1977, moonlighting at places
like NYC's Fillmore. It was a time when the influence
of DJs rivaled that of the radio. "We were at a table at
Limelight," Mark reminisces, "and this is when Ma-
donna had just released 'Everybody.' She was at the
table with us for about three hours. We had a lot of fun
with her." Back in the 1980s, DJs like Mark and Joe
could make Madonna famous.
W
hen House made its Connecticut debut in the
early '90s, Joe was attracting wild crowds at
Aetna Diner in Hartford. On June 7, 1995, The Hart-
ford Courant credited him with introducing House
