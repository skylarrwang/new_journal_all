A Furtive Endeavor 
JosEPH'S FURS STOCKS COATS, CAR-
ries mink, and doesn't trust anyone. 
The doors are always locked, the 
windows bolted, and the furs tucked 
away in a two-story safe with twen-
ty-inch-thick walls. Outside, mid-
day traffic 
and it is always day, as 
Joseph's closes at 4:30 
passes the 
neighboring donut shops and comic 
book stores. But inside 1193 Chapel, 
in the vault, all is quiet. It is a veri-
table fortress of pelts. 

One cannot just walk into J o-
seph's Furs. A potential customer 
must ring a bell and pass a thor-
ough inspection through the win.:. 
dow to gain access to New Haven's 
only historic furrier. Inside the 
sable-lined grotto, fluorescent light 
falls upon cheap carpeting, valuable 
antique endtables, standard office 
desks, fratned art, and cheap travel 
calendars. There seems to be no divi-
sion between office and showroom, 
4 
work and retail. A few decrepit man-
nequins, their chests scored by lines 
of ink, stand in the shadow of the 
safe, regarding their reflections in the 
gold -framed mirrors _that ov.erwhelm 
the demure white wails. There are 
few visible furs. 

"You don't see any coats on the 
floor, now do you?" Fred Joseph asks, 
pointing to the massive wheeled lock 
on the safe behind him. Mr. Joseph, 77, 
is wearing a tan Bur berry coat. He and 
his wife, Selma, dressed in imported 
Italian lambskin, have owned Joseph's 
Furs for over fifty years, ever since the 
death of Mr. Joseph's father, Louis, who 
founded Joseph's on Chapel in 1910. 
The younger Mr. Joseph has been sell-
ing and storing furs since he was 18 
years old and has . now bequeathed 
most management duties to his son. 

References to family, as well as ref-
erences to the impermeability of the 
vault and the general dangers of the 
outside world, are mainstays of con-
versation with the Josephs. The fam-
ily has circled its wagons around its 
furs and views outsiders with extreme 
trepidation. They demand a business 
card, identification, and proof of this 
magazine's existence before granting 
me even the paltriest of details about 
the store. Mrs. Joseph does not trust 
me at all 
throughout my talk with 
her husband, she frequently tells him 
that she is nervous about the inter-
view, and that he doesn't have to di-
vulge any information. "Look at him," 
she says. "He could be anyone, coming 
off the street like that. I don't like this. 
Why is he looking at the lamps?" 

After Mrs. Joseph reveals that 
the Josephs suspect everyone who 
enters their store, and after I assure 
her that I am not out to rob them, the 
mood lightens considerably. "You 
don't look like the fur type," Mrs . 
Joseph tells me, and her · husband 
agrees. "People in New Haven Yale 
students 
used to dress in beauti-
ful clothes," he says, "not like you." 

As Mr. Joseph reminisces about his 
native city's bygone glory days as a 
center for fine tailors and clothiers, it 
becomes apparent that the three prin-
cipal facets · of the Josephs' lives 
furs, 
family, and the history through which 
both have traveled 
are all embodied 
in the establishment which has sup-
ported them for decades. 

. 
The Josephs' suspicion· of outsid-
ers has its roots in 1813, when the 
building still housing Joseph's Furs 
was constructed. In the early 20th cen-
tury, Joseph's father bought the space, 
which was then surrounded by beau-
tiful verandas and inlaid with intricate 
woodworking. When Mr. Joseph re-
stored the decaying building in 1959, 
he found a number of bottles of Lydia 
Pinkham, a 19th Century feminine 
hygiene product stashed in the build-
ing's several chimneys. He is convinced 
they were hidden there by prostitutes. 
"This place was probably a bordello," 
he says. 

Whatever the profession of the 
building's past tenants, one fact is cer-
tain: for a few nocturnal hours in 1959, 
1193 Chapel was occupied by thieves. 
Following the building's restoration, 
the Josephs came to work one day to 
find 86 holes drilled in the steel safe 
wall's only weak spo , and dozens of 
furs missing. Since the break-in, the 
Josephs have been even more vigilant 
in protecting not only their furs, but 
everything else for which they stand-
elegance, their family, the rich and 
storied history of clothes in New Ha-
ven. Though it will never account for 
the Josephs' bizarre interior decorat-
ing choices in an apt reaction to the 
decor, one painting hanging behind an 
empty coat rack portrays a large man 
burying his head in his hands

pair's story explains much of the odd-
ity that permeates their sequestered 
office. The harsh mistrust, the de-
mands for a business card, the subse-
quent reprimands for the absence of a 
business card, the locked doors, the 
strangely coatless showroom, the in-
surance policy that covers "for every-
thing, up to insurrection and atomic 
attack," and the monolithic steel safe 
begin to make, like fur, an extrava-
gantly eccentric sort of sense. 

After the Josephs have warmed up 
to me--perhaps due to an hour of vig-
orous nodding in feigned agreement 
about matters of New Haven history 
I know nothing about-! am allowed 
to see the inside of the vault, an amaz-
ing display of trust. Even then, I am 
made to turn my back as the door is 
unlocked through a complicated pro-
cedure. To make sure I am not looking, 
Selma comes over to distract me with 
a newspaper article. Once Mr. Joseph 
opens the vault, he subtly blocks my 
entrance with his entire body, permit-
ting me to stand in the doorway and 
feel the carefully calibrated forty-de-
gree air flowing through two stories 
of fur coats organized by gender, type, 
and size. The sight of so many coats, all 
the size of the human bodies that wear 
them, reinforces the humanity behind 
the Josephs' bizarre suspicion of man-
kind. They suspect everyone, but they 
love New Haven, they lovehistory, they 
love family-and for them, fur is all of 
these things. 

If they don't suspect you of mal-
feasance, if they let you peer into a 
concrete bunker full of old women's 
mink, then you must be kin, worthy of 
their wisdom as elders. At the end of 
the day, Mrs. Joseph tells me to always 
listen to my mother. Mr. Joseph offers 
his own advice, fatherly wisdom he no 
doubt imparts to his son and business 
partner. "Wannabe s~ccessful? Marry 
a rich girl. It's what I did."
