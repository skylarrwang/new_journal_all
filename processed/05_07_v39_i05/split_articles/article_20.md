EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Nine sets of campus editors-including one from 
this magazine-showed up for the first meeting 
of the Yale Publications Council in early Feb-
ruary, and eight considered themselves journalists. This 
irked Betty Trachtenberg, the Dean of Student Affairs. 
When she and several residential college deans established 
the group, she said, "We wanted people to understand 
what was the concept of responsible journalism." Their 
mission proved difficult, as the avowed non-journalists 
were, in fact, the editors of The Yale Record, who consider 
themselves humor writers. Their mock "Blue Book," re-
leased last September, was one of a handful of publications 
that had motivated Trachtenberg to solve what she later 
called "the problems of these kinds of scurrilous articles 
16 
in various of our journals . ., She added, witheringly, "It's 
supposed to be passed off as humor, and people weren't 
buying it." 


Nearly every editor, however, including the Record's, 
left the room optimistic about the Council's possibilities 
and willing to attempt a second meeting. From their per-
spective, it had the potential to become a forum where 
editors could share tips, make the publishing process at 
Yale more open, and engage in dialogue with the rest of 
the campus community. For Trachtenberg and many of 
the cultural groups on campus, however, it was an effort 
to persuade Yale publications to change their habits: not 
only to stop printing the offending articles~but to actively 
acknowledge the minority presence at Yale. This change 
began long before the first meeting of the Publications 
Council. The student reactions against the inflammatory 
articles changed, however temporarily, the tone and poli-
cies of major publications at Yale, and sharply limited or 
refocused their discussions of race. The Council had little 
to do with the transformation, but its potential for rel-
evance is emerging: to determine whether these changes 
can become long-term parts of the Yale media landscape, 
for journalists and non-journalists alike. 


This landscape was rocked a year ago by the publica-
tion of two pieces. One was ''Me Love you Long Time: 
Yale's Case of Yellow Fever/' in the April issue of Rum-
pus. It appeared within several days of a cartoon in The 
Yale Herald depicting a student who suggests he would 
not vote for a candidate for YCC president because he 
was Asian. Students and administrators spotted the pair 
and were outraged. 


"Offensive speech is protected at Yale," President 
Richard Levin said. "That doesn't mean that if you say 
something that is deeply offensive to other people, you 
should be." Priya Prasad, president of the Asian Ameri-
can Students Association, alleged that the publications 
had advanced stereotypes substantially damaging to the 
perception of Asian students at Yale. Editors from both 
quickly apologized and underwent scathing criticism at 
two packed student forums. Students charged the Herald 
with a long history of perceived racial insensitivity; the 
Asian American Students Association sponsored a "Day 
~ 
of Silence," during which students gagged themselves 
to protest the publications' "racial insensitivity toward 
Asian Americans and other minority groups." 


Many students who were incensed by the articles 
grew frustrated that the protests, staged in the weeks be-
fore finals and summer break, inspired nothing but apolo-
gies and expressions of hope for a smoother fall term. April 
Joyner, an editor of Sphere, a publication about minority 
events and issues at Yale, supported the protests and went 
to both forums. "I don't think anything was really accom-
plished in the end;" she reflected. "Basically, the editors 
were attacked, and all they could do was apologize." 


In September, these fears were confirmed for many by 
the publication of the Record's Blue Book, which offend-
ed African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, gays, and others 
with a smorgasbord of fake courses like "AFAM101: The 
Difference Between Black People and White People. Black 
Stand-Up Comics;" "ARBC125: Introductory Terrorist 
Arabic;" and "SPAN135b: Practical Applications of Spanish 
for WASPs." Some groups labeled the publication bigoted. 
Another forum was held, at which many questioned the ef-
ficacy of the previous spring's demonstrations. 


Students, however, had underestimated the success 
of their protests. Deviating from what the newspaper had 
long viewed as its editorial role, Rumpus turned off the 
spigot of aggressive racial humor. Whatever its content, 
past and present editors of Rumpus have argued that the 
self-proclaimed tabloid fills a legitimate journalistic niche 
on campus. Kyle Mathews, a current Editor-in-Chief, re-
fers to the need for "fidelity to the institution," whose aim, 
he says, is to portray real discourse 
and behavior in which students are 
engaged, from gossip about daily alco-
hol-induced mishaps to the occasional 
orgy. 


Discussing the controversy, 
Mathews says: "What's so frustrating 
about that particular perspective is 
that it's a reflection of what students 
are saying privately. They [the protes-
tors] were attacking a symptom of the 
problem and not the problem itself." 


Sam Heller, an Editor-in-Chief who 
published the offending piece, admit-
ted to the Herald in an interview that 
he had edited the article with the in-
tent of maximizing its shock value. 


In response to the spring contro-
versy, Heller apologized profusely and 
claimed that the editors made an error 
in printing the article in its published 
form. Mathews, though he told me 
that he would "weather the storm" and 
publish another controversial piece "if 
we thought there was some merit to 
the article," admitted that<< in choosing 
which articles to run we've really tried 
to avoid topics of race." Indeed, no ar-
ticle on race has been published under 
Mathews' tenure. Heller, by contrast, 
published a handful, including "Party 
Lines: Black Parties Differ from White 
Parties" and "Miscegenation Station: 
Interracial Dating at Yale." 


The Record, which attempted to 
remain defiantly unfazed by the pro-
tests, ma:de changes of its own. Then-
Editor-in-Chief David Litt published 
a jokey pseudo-apology in the next 
issue of the Record, mocking his crit-
ics. But in an interview, he conceded 
that he had grown more cautious. 


"There's definitely things in the Re-
cord we would have printed, and we 
don't now," he said. He stressed that 
"it's not the protest that made us do 
that, but people who sat down and 
talked to us and said, <this made me 
feel shitty and here's why."' 


Yale's two main newspapers re-
acted with their own policy changes. 
The Herald began to limit provoca-
tive mentions of race. As at Rumpus, 
this proved a significant challenge 
to the paper's longstanding editorial 
prerogative. In an extended medita-
tion on the responsibilities of journal-
ists printed in a January issue of the 
Herald, former Editor-in-Chief Sar-
ah Raymond quoted her predecessor, 
Tamara Micner, defending her deci-
sion to print the offending cartoon in 
much the same terms as Mathews. "I 
thought it was pointed, and I thought 
it was smart, and it definitely struck 
a chord. This was based on stuff I 
actually heard people saying, and it 
was mirroring that, as art often does." 


Micner's and Heller's comments 
point to their shared sentiment that 
racist material in publications is not 
the whole problem, but a symptom 
of a larger question of racism on cam-
pus. Yet her official remarks last April 
were contrite. "The comic has come 
across as offensive and racist to a siz-
able portion of the student body," 
she wrote in an Editor's Note, "and 
in such a case the Herald recognizes 
that to some extent authorial intent 
no longer matters." 


Moreover, Micner mentioned 
in a later interview that she received 
another comic last April from the 
same artist referring to the contro-
versy generated by his earlier piece. 
"I found that it spoke to the attitudes 
that people were showing," she admit-
ted, but, "in the immediate aftermath, 
we didn't think it was necessary." She 
chose not to print it. Why had she 
changed her mind? "I think the bar 
has risen for the quality of the content 
versus its provocativeness," she told 
me. A glance at her successor's article 
on the topic confirms how much the 
Herald was rattled by the protests. 


Raymond concludes the piece by pre-
scribing Yale an exceptionally strong 
medicine. She argues that Yale should 
adopt a "Blueprint" that all students 
agree to uphold, a sort of journalis-
tic honor code that pledges not to 
offend. "Perhaps," Raymond rumi-
nates, "we could use a little guidance 
toward ethical life." 


The Yale Daily News, though 
not a major instigator of the pro-
tests, has attempted reforms that are 
potentially the most far-reaching. 
The News identifies itself as a lead-
er of campus discourse, not merely 
a faithful scribbler of it. Yet it is 
hardly a secret that the publication 
has historically had a poor relation-
ship with cultural groups on campus. 
Crystal Paul-Laughinghouse, the 
editor of the African-American Cul-
tural House's newsletter, identifies 
the News' coverage of cultural events 
as rare and often inaccurate, and says 
that black students have often had 
unpleasant experiences working as 
reporters there. As at other major 
campus publications, few minorities 
have ever sat on the paper's editorial 
board. 


Dean Trachtenberg and theN ews 
said that in the past year, the current 
Editor-in-Chief, Sarah Mishkin, has 
made a substantial effort to rebuild 
the relationship between the paper 
and cultural groups at Yale. Mishkin 
confirmed that the recent protests 
had largely motivated several chang-
es: "It's definitely something that set 
the agenda to focus on that." For the 
first time, a reporter, Judy Wang, has 
been assigned to cover primarily reli-
gious and cultural events, recently re-
porting a series on race and attending 
a host of cultural events. The News is 
also in the early stages of organizing 
a forum, co-sponsored by the Coali-
tion for Campus Unity-an organiza-
tion formed in direct response to the 
Record controversy-where students
