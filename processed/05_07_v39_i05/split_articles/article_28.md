avail. Instead, he offered to shorten 
Bell's tenure clock, so that he would 
come up for tenure a year earlier. Bell 
was unconvinced. "Without a JFE in 
place," he notes now, "it was like an 
offer to accelerate your trip to the fir-
ing squad." Shortly after his meeting 
with the chair, Bell accepted the Johns 
Hopkins position, where, he said, "I 
went in with the expectation of get-
ting tenure." Only four years later, he 
got it. 

Before the report, Yale had little 
to offer junior faculty courted by oth-
er institutions. This rendered it vul-
nerable to other universities eager to 
capitalize on Yale's tough standards. 
In a rapidly growing department like 
political science, inter-school com-
petition for junior faculty is fierce. 
"What places tend to do is try and go 
after people before they can make it 
by the Yale criteria," says Professor 
Ian Shapiro, who chaired the politi-
cal science department for five and a 
half years. "Pick them off earlier and 
earlier and earlier." 

But, as Bell's case exemplifies, 
the clinching reason to leave Yale is 
not that it's difficult to get tenure. 
Though many junior faculty leave 
for schools with significantly higher 
tenure rates, many others chose alter-
natives like Princeton, whose tenure 
rates are comparable to Yale's. Peo-
ple leave because they are not guar-
anteed even the possibility of vying 
for tenure. Everyone wants to know 
they will get their fair shot, and, until 
now, Yale has refused to provide this 
comfort. 

The changes remove a huge 
source of anxiety for junior faculty 
and allow the University to more 
competitively recruit and retain fac-
ulty, but it's hard to envision how 
the promise of tenure resources for 
everyone meshes with departments 
that depend on a large horde of junior 
faculty to staff small classes. 

The English department prides it-
self on its impressive number of intro-
ductory seminars especially designed 
for freshmen and sophomores. "Offer-
ing extensive introductory seminars 
taught by ladder faculty is a real pri-
ority for us," says Professor Langdon 
Hammer, chair of the English depart-
ment. "I assume that we will do what-
ever we need to do to ensure that we 
maintain that commitment. There's 
a real consensus that that's part of 
<what we do good.'" But staffing all the 
classes of English 125, 127, and 129 
depends upon a large body of junior 
faculty who teach more introductory 
courses than senior professors do. If 
the ratio of junior to senior faculty 
(currently 20:23 filled appointments) 
remains the same, will Yale honestly 
earmark the resources to tenure all of 
them? 

Hammer believes the new sys-
tem 
for representing faculty re-
sources is primarily descriptive, not 
prescriptive. "I don't see that the new 
accounting system mandates any par-
ticular ratio of junior to senior faculty, 
or otherwise promises to structure 
what departments do. I think it's sim-
ply a new way of describing how fac-
ulty resources are allotted and spent." 

As Yale can no longer feed junior fac-
ulty JFE excuses, the new system will 
force departments to deny them ten-
ure on the basis of their ,work. Eng-
lish Professor William Deresiewicz 
points to places like S~ford, which 
has a tenure track system but doesn't 
tenure an appreciably higher rate of 
junior faculty in the humanities. "So 
that's always going to be hanging over 
you to some degree." 

D 
eresiewicz is leaving Yale. In fact, 
after nine years as a much-loved 
junior professor in the English de-
partment, Deresiewicz is leaving aca-
demia altogether, and not exactly by 
choice. His tenure clock has run out, 
and the department concluded there 
were no openings in his field, 19th 
Century British literature. The long 
ten-year tenure clock has left Dere-
siewicz out of sync with the hiring 
patters of the rest of academia. There 
are few jobs advertised, and the ones 
he applied for he didn't get. The new 
system has reduced the tenure clock 
from ten to nine years, a move that, 
combined with the two years of leave, 
may help prevent the situation that 
Deresiewicz now faces. 

"It's very hard to get a job as an 
associate professor in term," Deresie-
wicz explains. "It's an in-between rank 
that schools don't usually hire at. So 
you're either left applying for a senior 
position, and you're at a disadvantage 
because you're not already tenured, or 
you're applying for a junior position 
and a lot of schools won't even consid-
er someone because they have to pay 
them too much, or because they have 
to tenure them too fast when they get

there." TheEnglishdepartment'sstatis-
tics suggest that Deresiewicz's experi-
ence in not representative. According 
to H ammer, over the past twenty years 
the vast majority of advanced assistant 
and associate professors in English 
have been able to move on to tenured 
or tenure-track positions at colleges or 
research universities. 

Nonetheless, the theme is re-
current in conversation. While Bell 
skipped out early to Johns Hopkins, he 
watched two of his former colleagues 
await a tenure decision, only to be 
ow they will get 
ale has refused to

denied. "One of them is now working 
at the Beinecke Library, and the other 
is working at a public policy organi-
zation in New York. Their careers are 
completely derailed," Bell laments. "If 
they had come up for tenure earlier, 
they would have been able to apply 
for junior level positions, but now it's 
too late." Bell compared these experi-
ences to a candidate who was recently 
denied tenure at Johns Hopkins. "He 
was able to turn it around and apply 
for junior positions at other places. If 
this had happened, you know, three 
years later, like it would at Yale, he 
might well be just kicked out of the 
field entirely." Yale's long tenure clock 
permits a department to postpone 
the bad news. "I think," Bell concludes, 
"it would be better if Yale were hard-
hearted with people earlier on." 

T
here will always be a tension be-
tween the University's desire for 
the best faculty in the world (and 
the ruthless system it proscribes) and 
the intimate chats and personal rela-
tionships that pepper a department's 
daily life. For students, it would be 
like going to school with the admis-
sions department for eight years be-
fore applying to Yale. For internal 
candidates, Deresiewicz believes the 
"personal stuff" will always color the 
ostensibly objective system. "Aca-
demic human nature being what it 
is, internal tenuring decisions, as op-
posed to when we bring someone in 
from the outside, are always going to 
be bound up in personal relationships, 
in politics, and therefore in rumor, in 
mystery." 

Tenurereviewinherentlyinvolves 
judgments by friends and colleagues. 
And the awkward balance of depart-
mental camaraderie and ruthless com-
petition often makes it easier for senior 
faculty to avoid the topic of tenure 
with their juniors altogether. Deresie-
wicz realized in his third or fourth year 
that he wasn't sensing the promising 
"signals" from the department that 
some of his peers, who later received 
tenure, were. "No one from the senior 
faculty had used the word tenure to 
me in an official-or even scarcely in 
an unofficial-capacity before this 
year." Deresiewicz understands the 
tendency to tiptoe around the tenure 
topic. "Nobody wants to talk about it 
because it's a very uncomfortable sub-
ject. Because, quite frankly, it's a kind 
of structural violence. The people who 
are running it don't want to be asso-
ciated with this. You're doing some-
thing that's inherently, well, violent, so 
there's the tendency not to be upfront 
about it, not to be honest about it. And 
that's a problem." 

In his sixth year, Deresiewicz 
had the required "six-year review," 
when associate professors can be 
promoted to associate professors on 
term. 

He received the promotion, 
but he remembers vividly sitting in 
his Chair's office, listening to her 
discuss his work, and waiting for the 
subject of tenure to come up. It never 
did. The sore point for Deresiewicz 
is not being denied tenure so much as 
the inadequate communication that 
proeceeded it. "The point is that they 
need to start talking about it earlier," 
he says. 

The tenure committee's report 
places additional emphasis on the re-
quired third and sixth year reviews. 
But the tenure committee also hopes 
to spark a more informal university-
wide discussion that may assuage 
some of that violence with dialogue. 
"I think what junior faculty members 
have felt, and what the University has 
come to feel, is that the junior faculty 
is a remarkable resource of the Uni-
versity that hasn't been sufficiently 
drawn upon and maximized," re-
marked Hammer. "And I would say 
simply talking about it is healthy, and 
a promising first step." The Yale com-
munity will have to wait to see what 
the report's changes amount to. But 
at a place like Yale that both nurtures 
and depends upon an open exchange 
of ideas, a real conversation about 
this contentious topic is an achieve-
ment in and of itself. And the Univer-
sity, finally, seems willing to talk.
