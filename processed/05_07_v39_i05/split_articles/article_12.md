lT IS A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT, OF 
all broom-based sports, curling is sec-
ond in popularity only to quidditch. 

It is a littler known fact that, this 
past fall, the quirky Scottish pastime 
was added to the roster of Yale's club 
sports teams. Enter Michael Lindsay, 
the athletic entrepreneur who is sell-
ing Yalies on this bizarre and misun-
derstood game. 

Lindsay's passion for curling only 
slightly precedes the founding ofYale's 
CurlingClub.The20060lympicGames 
gave the obscure sport some welcome 
publicity, and he was an immediate 
curling convert. "I became obsessed," 
says Lindsay, who first set his Tivo to 
record every match, and then set out 
to start a curling team at Yale. After ral-
lying support by searching for Yalies 
who had listed" curling" as a Facebook 
interest, Lindsay's brainchild passed 
the scrutiny of the Club SportS Advi-
sory Board and was soon registered as 
an official club sport. 

For Lindsay, the experience 
smacked of deja vu. During the 2000 
Olympic Games, he had a similar 
love affair with fencing. A student in 
the ninth grade at the time, he soon 
founded a fencing team at his high 
school. "I wasn't good at sports," 
says Lindsay with a good-natured 
laugh. 

Rather, he was good with 
swords. By his senior year, the team 
he had started was competing for the 
state championship. Lindsay contin-
ued his fencing career at Yale, com-
peting on the Varsity team for two 
years before devoting his full atten-
tion to the nascent curling club. 

Six months after he first fell for 
curling, Lindsay showed up at the 
Nutmeg Curling Club, a new curling 
facility in Bridgeport, CT, for the Yale 
CurlingClub'sfirstpractice.ltwasmid-
October 2006, and he had a handful of 
other would-be curlers in tow-a mot-
ley crew, mostly of his close friends, 
whom he had convinced with some 
difficulty to join the team. He also had 
his fingers crossed. The Berkeley ju-
nior, so passionate about curling, had 
never curled before in his life. "I had 
all of my eggs in one very risky basket," 
Lindsay admits. But this fringe sport 
enthusiast had struck upon another 
success, and curling turned out to be 
as much fun to play as, for most, it is 
to mock. 

An unconventional union of 
physical skill and strategy, curling is 
a perfect sport for the scholar-ath-
lete yearning to consider himself in 
a class above the stereotypical dumb 
jock. The game pits two teams of 
four against each other in ten inning-
like rounds called "ends." The teams 
take turns delivering a 44-pound 
granite stone down the "sheet," an 
alley of ice leading to the target area 
or "house." Sweepers precede the 
sliding stone, brushing the ice to re-
duce friction. Contact with the stone 
itself is an infraction called "burning." 
The sweepers help direct the stone to 
a targeted resting place determined 
by the "skip," the team's captain and 
chief of strategy. This entire process 
looks ridiculous. 

Unsurprisingly, some skeptics 
question this bizarre spectacle's sta-
tus as a sport. After all, athletic ability, 
physical fitness, and strength are by 
no means requisites-one of Nut-
meg's members is approaching her 
ninetieth birthday. "You can be pret-
ty horribly out of shape and still curl," 
says the team's treasurer, Matthew 
Lawler. Even avid dust-busters aren't 
necessarily at an advantage. "Brooms 
and I had never really gotten along 
before," says Lindsay, who showed 
no particular talent for sweeping as a 
5

child. In fact, "Chess-on-ice,'' as curl-
ing is commonly called, often looks 
most like a life-sized board game, a 
sophisticated reenactment of Chutes 
and Ladders. Even Lawler is reluc-
tant to classify it as a sport. "I'd call it 
a 'skilled activity,'" Lawler says. 

But curling's biggest threat isn't 
its debated classification. The Club 
Sports Advisory Board, which ac-
knowledges fishing and even ball-
room dancing as sports, had no trou-
ble bestowing the title. If curling has 
anything to worry about, it's global 
warming." Curlingliterallyfollows the 
ice patterns of the world," says Lind-
say, as he maps out curling's strong-
holdsinAmerica Wisconsin, Illinois, 
and other states along the border 
between the U.S. and Canada, where 
curling is asÂ· popular as ice hockey. 

Climactic restrictions have prevented 
the sport, which Lindsay and others 
claim is infectious, from infiltrating 
the athletic mainstream. "Florida is . 
not big on curling just yet," Lindsay 
jokes. But curling's popularity is rising 
faster than the ice caps are melting. 
Though curling was first introduced as 
an 0 lympic sport in 1998, the U.S. curl-
ing team's bronze medal in last year's 
Olympic Games has precipitated "the 
. perfect storm for curling" in the States, 
according to Lindsay. 

In fact, most of the other clubs 
Yale played against at the team's first 
match in early February were also in 
their starting year. "We went in ready 
to kick some ass," said Lindsay. And 
they did. A team of Yale freshmen 
and sophomores, competing as a "B-
team" alongside Yale's "A-Team" of 
juniors and seniors, won the tourna-
ment. Having gained confidence from 
the unexpected victory, a team of four 
Bulldogs decided to head, brooms 
in hands, to the national "bonspiel," 
or tournament, at the North Shore 
Curling Club in Chicago. 

When 
one player dropped out and another 
team member's flight from Kennedy 
Airport was snowed in, the team was 
debilitatingly halved. By picking up 
alternates, the remainder of Yale's 
6 
team the diehard duo of Lindsay 
and Freshman Edward Chang still 
managed to participate in the tourna-
ment. The severely handicapped team 
finished at nationals with a 0-3 record, 
two of the losses having come in the 
final throw of the match. 

Though the attitude may be un-
familiar to the typical Yalie, winning 
and losing are a mere side dish in this 
unconventional sport. At its. heart is 
"the spirit of curling," an age-old tradi-
tion of beer-drinking, good sports-
manship, and a vibrant pin, patch, and 
button culture. "The essence of the 
game is to enjoy the game," said Jim 
Meinhold, Nutmeg's Director of Col-
lege and Youth Curling, and it is advice 
worth heeding. The over-stimulated 
and overbooked Yalie might be sur-
prised, on adding this activity to her 
schedule, to learn what productive 
activity springs from, as Lindsay puts 
it, "stones, ice, and nothing to do."
