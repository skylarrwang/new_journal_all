Robert Frost was one acquainted with the night, and 
so am I. I have, on occasion, driven through it. 
My father works near the College, and when he 
takes trips out of town he parks his car by the office so I 
can use it while he's gone. I do. When I have studied for too 
long and read too much and the day's scenes begin to share a 
flatness of scope, my mind becomes adrift with thoughts of 
other places and a desire for movement, so I get into his car 
and drive. 

I have been one acquainted with the night. 
I have walked out in rain-and back in rain. 
I have outwalked the furthest city light. 
I have looked down the saddest city lane. 
I have passed by the watchman on his beat. 
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. 

Frost wrote these lines. When I read them earlier this year 
for class, I considered all the times I have gone out into 
the rain and returned, all the times that I have dropped my 
eyes from passersby at night, willed the darkness to absorb 
my form and permit me to travel unobserved. 

When I drive, I never go far. I might become lost and not 
know how to retrace my path. My concern, however, does 
not eliminate the allure of spontaneity. In the car, I could ride 
southontheinterstateintoNewYorkCityorwesttoPaloAlto 
or Seattle. I could head to Chicago and book a ilight out of 
O'Hare to Paris or Milan or drive along the Boston Post Road 
to Florida and board a helicopter headed for one of the Keys. 
I consider my options fleetingly but dismiss them. Of course I 
could venture to all these far off places, but I never do. Instead, 
I stay close to home and travel to familiar spots, places perma-
nently marked on my mental map. 

Often, when one speaks of trips by car, the pur-
pose behind such travel is escape. The shouts grow 
too loud in the house and the sole recourse is a swift 
exit through the kitchen's rear door. One needs to be 
somewhere else, and the car is both a means of escape 
and a place in itself. 

The trips I take, however, arise from an entirely 
different need: a desire not to break free of ties, but to 
tighten their strings. I drive not to flee the places that 
tire me but to revisit those from which I have long been 
away. 

As it happens, driving is the way I keep in touch. 
The routes of my trips are improvised but revolve 
around specific plot-points. There are certain spots 
that I never fail to drive past: the Prospect Street apart-
ment with the deep red inner walls, the Huntington 
Street home with a spruce-colored door and crimson 
curtains. The house on Everit painted pale yellow with 
black trim, graced by a low brick fence in front and ge-
raniums in the first floor window. I have never set foot 
in this house, but I've imagined eating breakfast there 
and spending winter mornings wrapped in blankets on 
the plush couches I see from the street. 

All of my stops are domestic. I am drawn to them 
by ornamental details-crimson curtains, geraniums-
that I instantly filed into my long-term memory. I am 
a magpie, tucking specific items and decorative traits 
into my nest for later assembly. 

During my drives on Prospect, I begin to notice a 
man seated at his desk before the second floor window, 
presumably hard at work. Whether he ever moves I 
cannot say, for he is always positioned exactly as I last 
left him, with the light from an unseen monitor illumi-
nating his face and infusing the dark room with a subtle, 
pulsing glow. Over time, I have come to rely on his 
presence. He has become the primary plot-point on my 
map, the first sign that all is in order, that I am properly 
charting the course. 

Another plot-point: my own home not seven min-
utes away from central campus. Some of its lights remain 
on, and I wonder who is awake within 
it. My brother, perhaps, his bedroom 
window still lit. That room used to be 
mine before I left for college and he of-
ficially took it over. Its position at the 
front of the house allows it to take in 
more light than any other room. Now, 
when I'm home, I sleep in a bedroom 
down the hall that overlooks the black-
top driveway. The weeping beech that 
envelops the drive blocks light from 
entering it. For that reason, the precise 
time of day is hard to determine and 
the position of stars difficult to chan 
from inside this room. 

In primary and high school I nev-
er escaped from home by car. Instead 
I sought solace in that room at the 
front of the house. I would run up-
stairs, lock the door, and-guided by 
a teen's wistful and romantic sensibil-
ity-stare out the window searching 
for some clue hidden amongst the 
stars. Where was fulfillment? How 
could I achieve it? Could I actually 
transpon myself to a happier, clearer, 
more satisfied state? Did the solu-
tions to all my anxieties and insecu-
rities reside in New York, Austin, or 
San Francisco? I rarely stare wist-
fully out of windows now but con-
tinue to toss such questions around 
while driving. The only difference 
between those years and these is that 
I no longer expect answers to reveal 
themselves in the sky. 

Growing up, many of my fam-
ily's most involved conversa-
tions took place in the car. It was the 
mobile stage upon which countless 
scenes were set. 

In the car, I cried and yelled as a 
result of these talks. Most of all, I lis-
tened. The car was where my parents 
offered their best advice, dispensed 
whatever wisdom they'd accrued from 
years of trial and error. It was where 
we discussed history and politics and 
where they recounted childhood tales. 
It was in the car that my parents told 
me, in one way or another, that if I 
worked steadily and consistently put 
fonh my best, I would succeed. 

Conversations of this type were 
often conducted on drives to and from 
the houses of my relatives. Subse-
quently, I began to conflate the route 
with the destination. While much is 
made of the notion that the destina-
tion pales in comparison to the jour-
ney, this outlook fails to acknowledge 
the extent to which familiarity with 
cenain byways actually enhances 
the experience of arrival. Take, for 
example, Route 25A, the road my 
family drives along to reach my 
grandparent's front door in Syosset, 
New York. 

I've traveled this road 
on weekdays throughout the sum-
mer and weekends in the fall when 
the sunset sky matches the hue of the 
changing leaves. I've traveled along it 
on the day after Christmas and Easter 
Sundays. I traveled along 25A to at-
tend my grandfather's funeral. 

25A sparks a series of associa-
tions in my mind: Split Rock Road, 
grandma, roast beef and sweet pota-
toes, interrupted anecdotes, cups of 
tea drunk late at night. When I travel 
along 25A, I already know precisely 
where I am headed. This panicular 
destination does not arise from deci-
sions made along the drive. Rather, 
the familiar route makes the endpoint 
clear from the start; no division exists 
between the two. In my mind, 25A 
leads only to one place. 

Most roads, however, are not as-
sociated with remembrances of sweet 
potatoes and tea. Most roads serve 
solely as throughways, means to 
travel from one location to the next. 
Self-deception is universal, and the 
tactics employed to support it hard to 
pierce. Driving from house to house, 
piecing together those ornaments 
collected for the magpie's nest-
these tactics substitute for searches 
amongst stars from inside a locked 
room. I am no less na1ve about my 
pursuit of that elusive something. I 
still trust the search, refusing to ac-
knowledge its futility. 

In the car, isolated from the out-
side, I deliberately suspend time for a 
spell and drive unaware of whatever 
hour the clock reads. Locked in my 
vehicle, I reflect on the emotional risk 
involved in setting off on my own, the 
nerve necessary to go it alone with-
out peripheral support. I consider the 
pluck needed to embark on a journey 
unsure of where it will conclude. I con-
sider the way in which my car serves as 
a ponable fonress sheltering me from 
the outside air and how, as its driver, 
my search through the outside world 
is still conducted in a space that is de-
cidedly enclosed.
