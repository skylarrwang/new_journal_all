Shades, radios in from the distant 
Planet of Hollywood. Heresy. 

Most people in Hollywood have 
big dreams. So do most people at Yale. 
Kevin Winston, who graduated from 
Yale in 1991, called his dream Yale in 
Hollywood. A few years ago, he and 
several alumni in the entertainment 
industry began to plan entertainment-
related events for the Yale Club of 
Southern California. At a happy hour 
in 2002, held at a bar owned by Matt 
Damon and Ben Affleck, one hundred 
Yale alumni made appearances. Af-
ter the event's success, Winston and 
a few other Yalies decided to forge 
ahead under the banner"YaleinHolly-
wood.'' First,morehappyhours. Then 
panels. Panels on "How I got into the 
Biz," panels on video games, panels on 
"The Marketing of Winnie the Pooh to 
a Global Audience." An e-mail list of 
eight hundred. And every summer 
since . 2003, an internship program, 
feeding current Yale students into the 
system.

As it turns out, there are some 
things Theater Studies 110 just can't 
teach you. As Junior Dariush Nothaft, 
current president of Bulldog Produc-
tions and a San Diego native who 
worked at a production .management 
firm last summer as part of Yale in 
Hollywood, says, "The West Coast is a 
__..;.,- completely different animal. It hasn't 
-
really been a part of Yale culture." Win-
YALE STUDENTS HAVE RECENTLY DIS-
covered a small planet exerting a 
stronger and stronger pull on New 
Haven: its name is Hollywood, and 
there, everything you thought you 
know, is no more. Take, for instance, 
the value of a Yale degree. "It doesn't 
matter that you went to Yale," Lynd-
sey Ford 'OS, former member of 
ston agrees. "At Yale, Sunday through 
Wednesdayyoustudy. Thursday,may-
beyougoout. Friday, Saturday: Toads." 
He gazes through ocean-blue contact 
.lenses to the sidewalk of Sunset Bou-
levard, where his dog; Achilles, waits. 
Achilles, Winston explains, was named 
fortheBradPittcharacterin Troy. "Hol-
lywood is very much about meeting 
people. It's pretty much the opposite 
of Yale. You go out Friday, Saturday, 
and every weekday to, say, a Yale in 
Hollywood event." 

Winston never dreamed he'd 
land in L.A. After Yale, he attended 
graduate school "at that other place, 
· in Boston," and then zipped off to L.A.
