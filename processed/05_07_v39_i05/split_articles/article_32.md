The 
Boutique cakes are on the rise in Connecticut .

ustomers ask the Vona sisters for fire trucks, hamburgers, and 
trumpets. They demand kittens. Could you make me a red 
sneaker, like an Adidas sneaker? A reclining cheetah, complete 
with spots oh, and, can you put him on a bed of jungle grass? 
Whatever the order, the Vonas provide. All it takes is sugar, flour, eggs, 
butter, baking soda, and buttercream frosting. "I bring ideas to life 
using 
cake," says the slender, sharp-nosed Sofia Marini, pushing up her hairnet. 
"For grass we use coconut, for water we use royal icing. We have to get ere-
-
ative." Along with her two younger sisters, Sofia owns and runs The Cake 
Boutique, an unconventional bakeshop that sells its goods "by appoint-
ment only" and is known in wealthy Wilton, Connecticut for its "Shaped 
Custom Cakes." 

Business is booming, and the turn-of-the century carriage house the 
girls bought four years ago is starting to feel cramped. The kitchen's large 
single oven will cook ten separate cakes over the next two days, all ordered 
for Easter Sunday. Spending upwards of twenty hours to concoct each in-
dividual dessert means that the sisters often stay in the kitchen until two 
or three in the morning. Sonya and Sandra joke that if they bake a cake for 
their eldest sister, it will take the form of a Dunkin' Donuts · cup because 
Sofia is "always attached to a cup of coffee." 

These days, it seems that everyone in Wilton wants a sculpted cake. 
Driving up Danbury Road~to the boutique, the sisters pass their old high 
school and continue past gentrified strips of antique stores and cozy cafes. 
"It's a cute town," Sofia said, "with people who will spend money on cakes." 
At twelve dollars per slice for pa1ticularly difficult forms (witness the chee-
tah), the Cake Boutique's clientele is limited. You can tell by perusing the 
cakes in their backlog; one client ordered a cake shaped like a purse, filled 
-with cookies sculpted after her choice cosmetics 
Chanel Glossimier, Vega 
eye-shadow, and "Mystery Blush." You can now have your designer bag 
and eat it too. Consumerism becomes consumption. 

The Vona enterprise is just the latest slice of an American baking trend 
_ that started in the 70s, when sculpted cakes were displayed to attract fair-
goers. At the top tier of that movement was Roland A. Winbeckler, a baker 
who stacked his reputation on life-sized cakes resembling celebrities from 
Christopher Columbus to a midriff-baring Cher. Last TV season, the ce-
lebrities he carved stepped aside to let cake sculptors share the limelight,

Historically cakes have been round, 
as that is the natural shape of rising dough. 
(Batter came later, as pans were invented.) 
But because the delicacy is eaten almost ex-
.. elusively on special occasions, the shape of 
cake has taken on more significance. Ro-
mans impressed their cakes with stamps 
depicting gods; Russians ate round cakes in 
·praise of the sun; and Chinese cooks served 
round mooncakes to honor the goddess of 
the moon. We bake what we praise. 

In 1976, Winbeckler baked a cake in . 
the shape of Colonel Sanders, founder of 
Kentucky Fried Chicken, and presented to 
the god a cake in his own image. The Col-
onel asked, "Is it chicken flavored?" More 
recently, police officers arrested a Connecti-
cut bride for hurling slices of cake at cater-
ers who had closed the bar. Upon arrest, she 
attempted to bite an officer. When the cake 
is a weapon, and the man is a cake, can we 
no longer distinguish what is edible, what is 
real, and what is cake?

Welcome to the realist movement of 
culinary arts, where customer testimonials 
on the bakery's website praise the Vonas as 
"artists." One Wilton mother attested that, 
for her son's bar mitzvah, the sisters had 
"created an actual boat so stunningly accu-
rate that many guests thought it could not 
possibly BE a cake!" It was a success, as re-
alist art is, because it deceived its audience. 

Growing up, the sisters joined their

recipes every Sunday after lunch. Their fa-
ther, a stonemason, sat back and ate. "His 
medium is stone," said Sofia. "He made 
beautiful things out of stone." The Vonas' 
craft melds their parents' professions. Just 
as their father once carved rock, today they 
lean over teetering towers of stacked sheet 
cake and, with lean knives, cut away to un-
cover the forms buried within. "Actually a 
lot of people tell us they don't want to cut 
into the cake," Sofia said. "They don't wan-
na destroy it." But the Vona sisters know 
better. Moved by artistic mettle, their brave 
carving recalls a statement of Michelangelo 
that their father might have known: "I saw 
the angel in the marble and carved until I 
set him free." 

A popular video posted on YouTube 
shows a British baker sculpting a block of 
chocolate cake into a near-perfect replica of 
a slumbering human baby, complete with 
tiny, curled fingers molded of peach fondant. 
The final cake seems innocent, almost ador-
able. But comments from the videos viewers 
seethe with disgust: What sicko would want 
to eat a baby? Such a question is central to 
cake sculpting. Why do we desire to ingest 
what we love? To eat the work of cake is akin 
to Communion, wherein we take that which 
we love inside of ourselves in a cannibalistic 
ritual. 

"Eventuallytheymaketheirwayimoit," 
Sofia said of her timid customers. "They wan-
na see what's inside." To know the cake, they 
must destroy it. To fully love it, they must gut 
it. Anne, a Wilton bride, wrote to the Von a sis-
ters that she had overheard guests express-
ing surprise because "cakes that are pretty 
usually don't taste good." It's a lesson those 
attendees might have learned anywhere in 
life. Perhaps it is only in cake art that surface 
and interior arc equally rewarding, that what 
is beautiful is also kind, and also sort of deli-
cious, and buttery, and downright satisfying.
