what is currently regarded as a cumbersome and illogical system that is not only out of sync with the rest of 
academia, but also hampers Yale in its quest to attract and retain the best faculty. The report compares the 
existing structure with the Swiss Franc, "a unique currency with increasingly high transaction costs," 
and proposes a multifaceted solution. The new policy will give each junior faculty hire a guaranteed 
shot at tenure in a shorter amount of time, preference over outside candidates in the tenure com-
petition, and two years of paid leave. 


A
former Yale associate faculty member felt like she had been let back in the pearly 
gates when she was offered a junior position in the University's political science 
department. "I had been an undergraduate at Yale, and I felt like graduation was 
expulsion from Paradise," she remembers. "So getting a job there was beyond 
my wildest dreams." A junior position can spark the hope that Yale will 
ask you to stay for good, but those familiar with Yale's tenure system 
will advise new hires not to get too attached. From those who left 
after a few years to several current department chairs, the same 
sentence surfaces again and again: I never expected to get ten-
ure here. 

The faculty member loved the excitement that filled 
the political science department when she arrived. "I 
thought, this is an extraordinary intellectual en-
vironment, and a place where my scholarship 
would really improve." But she kept her 
hopes in check. "In general, I thought 
I wouldn't get tenure, but it would 
be a wonderful place to be in the 
meantime. It was dangerous 
to have anything else than 
that for your attitude." 

Four years later she 
accepted a job

position at Yale, but Princeton's sys-
tem guaranteed tenure review, and 
seemed to be governed by a rational-
ity absent from Yale's. She was con-
tent with her junior faculty position 
at Yale because she arrived fully pre-
pared to leave. But for a number of 
the most promising young post-docs, 
the question remains: Why bother 
with Yale at all? 

One major issue addressed in 
the report is Yale's former system of 
Junior Faculty Equivalencies. In the 
unreformed system which will per-
manently disappear on July 1 JFEs 
served as financial allotments for 
faculty members. Departments had 
set numbers of JFEs; a junior hire 
took one JFE, and a senior hire took 
two. For a junior faculty member to 
achieve tenure, an extra JFE had to 
be available within his or her depart-
ment, which occurred only when a 
faculty metnber had recently vacated 
a position or if the department chair 
successfully petitioned for another. 
Under such a system, even the most 
qualified junior faculty member could 
be refused tenure if no additional JFE 
was available. When Salovey was a 
junior professor, the then-chairmen· 
of the Psychology department told 
him, "Peter, even if Psychology gave 
a Nobel prize, and you won it, we 
still can't guarantee there will be a 
spot for you." Many faculty mem-
bers see JFEs as a useful pretext for 
their department to deny someone 
tenure without reviewing his or 
her work. 

Even if a JFE became available, 
the hurdles had ju.st begun for the 
qualified junior faculty member. The 
next major obstacle was the open 
search. When a position became 
available in a particular department, 
Yale sent letters to top professors in 
that field asking them to list the best 
scholars in the discipline. If the fac-
ulty member's name didn't · surface 
on these lists, the process stopped 
right there. Until now, there was no 
such thing as an ~cinternal candidate" 
at Yale. The system put no value on 
place; to be reviewed for tenure was 
to apply for a fresh job open to the 
best candidates in the field. 

Though the open search policy 
sounds ruthlessly fair, there was suspi-
cion among junior faculty that it was 
sometimes manipulated to produce 
certain desired results. The letter of 
the law is so high that it can be used 
as a shield from blame; hypothetically, 
if a department liked an inside candi-
date, the chair could send the letters 
to a select sample of scholars likely to 
include the candidate's name on their 
lists. In the opposite scenario, all a 
department had to do was stick to the 
written rules, and there was a pretty 
good chance the candidate wouldn't 
make it through. 

It's hard to distinguish rumor 
from truth, but the rampant specula-
tion and nebulous anxiety the open 
search policy inspired among junior 
faculty was detrimental enough. "I 
remember worrying more about the 
oddness of Yale's procedures than my 
own work," said Salovey. "Are people 
going to realize with this list of names 
that the question is really ~should we 
tenure Peter or not?' I was more wor-
ried about these issues than my schol-
arship or teaching, because I felt those 
things were under my control." 

As elite departments develop at 
universities across the country, young 
scholars no longer feel compelled 
to risk Yale"s tenure-policy to achieve 
prestige. "The first complaint is that 
they don't do that at Princeton, they 
don't do that at Michigan, Berkeley, 
Chicago, and on and on," observes 
Butler. "Brand new faculty don't want 
to go through that. It's so far from the 
center, from standard practice. Among 
other things it probably restricts the 
numbers of people who want to come 
to Yale." 

Academia is notoriously gossipy, 
and the committee is confident that 
news of Yale's tenure changes will 
travel fast. By abolishing JFEs and 
promising each junior faculty hire 
the resources for a potential senior 
position, the new report places more 
significance on the initial hiring than 
ever before. "The old system created 
a little bit of cynicism," remarked 
Salovey. With an open search policy, 
"there's the sense that if some appoint-
ment doesn't work out, the system is 
self-correcting." 

While the changes make Yale's 
system less idiosyncratic and more at-
tractive to potential hires, the results 
cannot be entirely predicted. When 
the diennial review mandated by 
the report is published, it will reveal 
whether the number of junior facul-
ty promoted to tenured positions at 
Yale increases. At least as important 
as numbers, however, is convincing 
the nation's PhDs of Yale's change of 
heart. "We think this will attract re-
ally exciting, excellent new non-ten-
ured faculty and propel them into the 
kind of the career they want," said 
Butler. "And if they are successful, 
we hope that they'll stay at Yale." 

David Bell had been a junior fac-
ulty member in the Yale history 
department for four years when Johns 
Hopkins offered him a job. The po-
sition was untenur ed, but Yale's sys-
tem made it hard to justify staying in 
New Haven. Bell was torn, and he 
went to his department chair's office 
to tell him about the offer. "We'd 
like to keep you," the chair respond-
ed. "What can we offer you?" Bell 
knew he was far too young to come 
up for tenure at Yale, but he asked his 
chair if the department could create 
another JFE in his field to indicate 
at least a modicum of commitment. 
The chairman looked into it but to no
