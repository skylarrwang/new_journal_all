will offer opinions and air frustrations 
about the paper's coverage of campus 
groups. Dean Trachtenberg volun-
teered that "the editor of the Yale 
Daily News is very sincere in its wish 
to be more inclusive. And I think if 
you look at the YDN, it's different 
this year." 

Trachtenberg's publica-
tions council helped drive the change: 
both Wang's highly unusual series on 
race at Yale and the planned forum 
emerged shortly after the council's 
first meeting. 

These recent developments at the 
News are probably the group's only 
achievements so far. But they signal 
what role, if any, the council may play 
in building on the temporary, reac-
tionary changes of the Record, Rum-
pus, and Herald. Race may have been 
absent from Rumpus for the past year, 
but turnover on editorial boards will 
ensure that the controversy shadow-
ing the tabloid will soon be forgotten. 

The administrators behind the Coun-
cil's creation-primarily Berkeley's 
Dean Kevin Hicks and Trachtenberg, 
as well as a handful of other Residen-
tial College Deans-see the group as 
a long-term opportunity. Alexandra 
Suich, the editor-in-chief of the Yale 
Globalist, attended the meeting and 
described a conversation with Hicks 
immediately afterwards. "Dean Hicks 
sees it as a much more far-sighted or-
ganization," she said. "He wants the 
creation of a culture where the pub-
lications won't want to publish this 
material." 

This solution is more moder-
ate than many of the ideas that per-
colated at the time of the Council's 
creation. Alfred Guy, the director of 
the Yale Writing Center, witnessed 
its evolution. Within a few weeks of 
each other, two separate groups ap-
proached him and asked if he would 
do something about the state of un-
dergraduate journalism at Yale. The 
first group was blunt. Saveena Dhall, 
an Assistant Dean and Director of the 
Asian Cultural Center, came with two 
students to ask Guy if there was any-
thing he could do to prevent publica-
tions from printing articles considered 
May2007 
offensive by cultural groups at Yale. 
Guy politely declined. 

The second group was a little 
more reserved. 

Three Residential 
College Deans asked Guy, as well as 
Mark Oppenheimer, head of the Writ-
ing Center's Journalism Initiative, to 
participate in a new administrative 
proposal called the Yale Publications 
Council. Though yet unformed, the 
council they and Trachtenberg envi-
sioned would bring together editors 
from all major campus publications-
from the News to Rumpus-to regu-
larly meet and discuss common goals, 
guidelines, and challenges. The deans 
asked Guy and Oppenheimer to help 
set up events for the Council, and the 
five brainstormed ideas like bring-
ing professional journalists to Yale 
to meet with the editors. But as the 
Deans gradually expanded their vi-
sion for the council, Guy drew back 
and once again refused to participate. 

"They were talking about a journal-
istic code of ethics," he said. "I was 
worried that somehow it would seem 
that there would be a party line." 

Dhall's request reflected the at-
titudes of many cultural groups on 
campus at the time. In the wake of the 
Record forum, a group of students 
sent a packet of offensive articles 
printed in Yale publications to the na-
tional media. Though not part of that 
intiative, Josh Williams, co-founder 
of the Coalition for Campus Unity 
and a co-moderator at ~the forum, 
called its work "very professional" 
and is puzzled by the packet's failure 
to generate coverage. The Yale chap-
ter of the NAACP suggested that the 
administration trash an entire print 
run of a publication that was deemed 
offensive. 

However much these attitudes 
may have motivated the Council's cre-
ation, Trachtenberg, who claims to be 
adamantly against censorship, stressed 
that the group is an entirely voluntary, 
editor-run group. This characteristic 
suggests its potential and the recipe 
for its undoing. Editors who believe in 
transforming the temporary racial gag 
rule in Yale's major publications into a 
lasting consciousness, one that stimu-
lates campus dialogue about divisive 
issues instead of occasionally shock-
ing the campus, may find the Council a 
receptive setting. Editors have spoken 
of beginning monthly dialogues with 
cultural groups and offended students 
and moving beyond periodic ritual of 
frustrated campus-wide protests and 
apologies. TheCouncilcouldadd trans-
parency to the editorial process, and, 
as Raymond suggested, set up guide-
lines of ethical conduct for reporters, 
editors, and writers. 

But the Council's members, as 
the Record made clear, are not all 
journalists, and the various responses 
to the most recent crises suggest how 
difficult it may be to forge any agree-
ment or informal co-regulation be-
tween editors. As the Rumpus' Kyle 
Mathews said, it would be useless to 
try to set standards of journalism for 
the Council, because the only stan-
dards he would consent to would 
be laughably inadequate for the 
YDN. And editors are wary, what-
ever Trachtenberg's assurances to 
the contrary, that the Council could 
begin to exercise a chilling effect on 
worthwhile yet controversial printed 
material. It is perhaps for these rea-
sons-coupled with Trachtenberg's 
imminent departure and the impossi-
bility of finding a common free hour 
for a dozen people at Yale--that the 
likelihood of a second Publications 
Council meeting is slim. 

There is another matter. 
"To 
take on serious issues," Guy told 
me simply, "you might have to of-
fend people." Journalism at Yale, in 
his view, isn't actually broken. "I 
wouldn't vote for any particular of-
fense," he said; "But," he added, "I 
would rather work in a place where 
the student publications occasionally 
fuck up."
