years of consuucuon expen-

an unskilled laborer. He rarely gets 
hired to complete the more lucrative 
"gravy work," or finishing. touches, on 
a project. Art:hur Tucker ts black. He 
thinks this might be why. 

Though Tucker didn't attend City 
Hall's public hearing on minority con-
struction hiring in early March, he was 
represented in absentia by a fu~ house 
of people with similar complamts. ~n 
an impassioned and unexpected twtst,

pitted themselves against a woman 
who has done more to help them find 
jobs in New Haven ov.er the ~as~ six 
years than anyone has m the ctty s re-

CEO investigates employment dts-
crimination, enforces construction 
contracts, and inspects sites to ensure 
regulations are being followed. ~ur­
ingJefferson's second yea~ on the_Job, 
the CEO conducted 508 mspecnons. 
Last year, it completed 1,061. 

N
ew Haven's Commission on 
Equal OpportUnities is located 
in a bustling City Hall office that has 
long been too small for i~s occupants. 
In addition to these duttes, Jef-
ferson runs a construction training 
program that was transferred to her 
office after its rocky start at the Work-
force Alliance. Between 1999, when 
the Construction Workforce Initia-
tive began, and 2001, when Jefferson 
took the reins, less than one hundred 
residents graduated from the program. 
This tally was surpassed within the 
first year of Jefferson's tenure. Ideally, 
CWI graduates are mat~hed wi.th con-
tractors working on Ctty proJects, a 
set-up that benefits all panics-the mi-
norities need jobs and the contractors 
need minorities-as New Haven law 
mandates that 25% of the hours spent 
on City-funded construction projects 
must be logged by minority workers. 

Jefferson also assumed cont!ol of the 
previously un-enforced ProJect Labor 
Agreement, which s~tes that 25%. of 
the hours spent on ctty consuuctton 
projects must be completed by New 
Haven union workers. In yet another 
gesture of confidence last fall, the Ci~ 
gave her office employment supe~t­
sion duties at all New Haven Housmg 
Authority worksites. 

Six years after these structural 
shifts the CE.O b.as· .pushed New

Nichole Jefferson, prestdent of the 
CEO, has tucked pit<;hers of fake 
flowers between the heaps of paper 
that cover her office: -As she· plucks 
bulging files from the visu~ chaos, 
it is clear that she loves her JOb and 
does it well. 

The Commission-founded in 
1964 and one of the oldest munici-
pal civil rights agencies in the cou?-
try-has not always hummed as tt 
does now. Before Jefferson was hired 
in 2001, she says, •nobody ever did 
anything. Zero, zip, zilp, blah, blah, 
blah." With only five staff members, 
Jefferson notes, "the office didn't re-
received training and landed well-
paying construction jobs through 
Jefferson's office. So why do so ~any 
minorities still feel that they can t get 
or keep jobs because of their race? 

iscrimination 
is 
everywhere," 
Jefferson say~, her f~ce framed 
by letters hanging 10 her wmdow that 
spell out "INTEGRITY." "It's in 
this building, it's on this floor-but 
you've got to have pro~ f." Thou~h 
her office receives mynad casual m-
quiries into what constitutes discrim-
ination, only about ten formal com-
plaints are filed each year. Jefferson 
constantly meets with people who 
fume about racist employers, and she 
often believes them. But if workers 
won't divulge their names, much less 
the details of their experiences, she 
can do nothing. 

"I only deal in facts," Jefferson 
explains. "When you discriminate 
against someone, you gotta be able .to 
prove it. You have to have facts, wnte 
down times, have witnesses-you 
gotta give me some ammunition." 

She has facts on the disgruntled 
workers who complained about dis-
crimination at the public hearing, and 
they aren't pretty. One black woman 
who claimed she was -laid off for no 
reason has a history of drug abuse, 
and Jefferson wouldn't be surprised 
if she'd begun using again. Another 
African-American man, also recently 
laid off was blacklisted by his union 
for ev;ding its educational require-
ments. Jefferson dug up payrolls to 
prove that another worker, who'd 
passionately argued tha~ black '"?en 
were being laid off a parncular proJeCt 
once the contractors had filled their 
quota, had been flat-out lying. She
