Getting Tenure Back on Track 
Changes improve the junior faculty experience. 
by Sophia Lear 
a history conference in 2004, an eminent Yale histo-
an introduced himself to David Bell, the Andrew W. 
ell on Professor in the Humanities atJ ohns Hopkins 
University. "Oh, how nice to meet you!" the Yale professor 
said warmly. "What work are you doing?" Bell-once a ju-
nior faculty member in Yale's history department--eyed his 
fellow historian before politely answering the question. But, 
as he recalls now, "I had to hold myself back from saying, 'I 
had an office across the hall from you for years! You really 
should know who I am.'" To merit his former colleague's at-
tention, Bell had to leave Yale and get tenure elsewhere. 


On February 5th, 2007, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences 
Tenure and Appointments Policy Committee released its re-
port on tenure at Yale. Acknowledging the plight of Bell and 
legions like him, the report offered specific changes to the 
tenure system and an admission Yale professors have long 
been waiting to hear: systemic difficulties in tenuring junior 
faculty members is hurting the Yale community and hinder-
ing the University in the cutthroat world of academia. "It's 
unusual," says Professor Jon Butler, Dean of the Graduate 
School and co-chair of the committee. "Most reports on ten-
ure and appointments don't discuss the experience of junior 
faculty." 


Beginning in September 2005, the nine-person commit-
tee met 31 times over 15 months. Provost Andrew Hamilton, 
who appointed a committee of four divisional directors and 
three professors, co-chaired by Dean of Yale College Peter 
Salovey and Dean Butler, initially expected the group to fin-
ish its report by spring 2006. But the committee quickly re-
alized its work would take significantly longer. The problem 
was not divisiveness; a united belief in the need for reform 
charged the group from the start, and all of its members 
easily agreed on the targets for change. Rather, the delay 
30 
was prompted by the committee's determination to find 
a concrete solution to an arcane system, one that could 
provoke a change in Yale's overall academic culture. The 
report aims to be not only a technical tweaking, but a 
holistic evaluation. "The problem we're addressing is not 
. one of the number of people tenured or the rate of tenure,,. 
Dean Salovey clarified. "The problem addressed is how to 
achieve rational and appropriate teaching and citizenship 
at Yale." 


Until now, Yale's tenure policy has differed radically 
from those at almost all other universities. At a tenure-
track university, junior hires are guaranteed that a tenured 
position will be available should they eventually qualify 
for it; their cases are reviewed internally, and a lot of them 
make the cut. But Yale promises nothing: junior hires are 
not necessarily reviewed for tenure; instead, they're often 
told that no openings exist in their department. If a junior 
faculty member is brought up for review, he or she must 
compete without preferential treatment against every 
other scholar in the field, with the position offered to the 
most qualified candidate. 


The University has justified its unique system by ar-
guing that Yale is a unique place. To receive'tenure at Yale, 
candidates must, as the report insists, • stand in competi-
tion with the foremost leaders in their field throughout 
the world.,. Salovey claims that the report will not lower 
these standards. "It is difficult to get tenure at Yale, and it 
will still be difficult to get tenure at Yale, and we're happy 
about that." 


Yale's tough-love policy has long. distinguished it 
among elite institutions. But in the increasingly competi-
tive world of academia, the Yale system has become more 
and more of a liability. The committee aims to streamline
