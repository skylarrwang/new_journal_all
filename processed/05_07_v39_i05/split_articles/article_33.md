Bard-hopping 
by Ben Lasman, Nick Handler, 
and Ali Seitz 
It is one a.m. at the all-:night Shakespeare marathon in 
Linsley-Chittenden Hall. Shakespeare enthusiasts abound, 
grouped in rooms according to dramatic genre: history, 
tragedy, comedy, miscellaneous. Enter Ben Lasman, Nick 
Handler, and Ali Seitz, armed with notebooks. 
Scene i: Ben Lasman, journalistic rogue, observes the players. 
By 1:30, only two people remain in the Miscellaneous 
room. One, his_ face engulfed by The Collected Works of Wil-
liam Shakespeare, recites "Sonnet 152" in a stentorian tone. 
His partner stands at attention, book in hand, like a tag-team 
wrestler primed to enter the ring. Had these poets decided to 
stage their soliloquies on the corner of York and Elm Street 
instead of within the warmly-lit interiors of Yale's English 
department, most passersby would have thrown them some 
change. Rather than repelling onlookers with their bra-
zen dorkiness, the speakers project the dignified aura often 
claimed by Civil War reenactors. Perfonming for itself, the 
old guard stands for history in an age of 1mimpeded progress, 
promoting the immortal relevance of artistic tradition against 
the fleeting affectations of YouTube. 

They want to share their message and will go to great 
lengths to do so. The first orator, a graduate student at Boston 
University, traveled all the way from Massachusetts to attend 
the Bardic festival. "My friend and I got a bunch of e-tnails 
about it and decided, 'Hey, it's a way to spend a Saturday 
night,'" explained the attendee. As he rifles through an ava-
lanche of dog-eared folios in search of All's Well That Ends 
Well, his companion launches into "Sonnet 154." With 
the clock ticking and over a dozen full-length works left 
to read, the pair flips pages, picks roles, and presses on to 
the next play.

Scene ii: Nick Handler knavishly infiltrates History. 
Bleary-eyed and adrift in the LC hallway, I am yanked 
into the History room, where an unshaven thespian in an 
ill-fitting polo shirt pleads, "Do you want to be the Duke 
· of Orleans?" With no time to respond, I am thrust into 
the middle of a circle of chairs alongside the Dauphin and 
Lord Rainbures, who hands me a dusty copy of Henry V. 
The King lounges in the English camp near the window 
with his plastic sword, contemplating the imminent bat-
tle at Agincourt. A gawky Lear stands outside the door, 
looking for an Edmund. 

We are at the end of Act III, in the French camp near 
the blackboard. The night before the battle is dragging on, 
and I am growing tense. ·After forty minutes of Dauphin 
stumbling through a verbose insult of my horse, I begin to 
understand the Duke's impatience: "Will it never be morn-
ing?" Enter King Henry in Ralph Lauren armor and wire-
rim glasses, lamenting histrionically, "Thou proud dream 
. that plays so subtly with a king's repose ... " 
1:45 .. . 
2:00 .. . 
By 2:30, I am looking for some repose of my own. 
Tired and fed up with King Henry's whining, my last 
lines come with a little extra energy: 
"What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of 
England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out 
of his knowledge!" 
Exit Orleans. 
Scene iii: Ali Seitz, bastard son, finds pizza. 
"Will you be Edgar?" 
My chin drops, quivers a little, nods of its own accord. 
I am moved by the sincere expressions in the bright Trag-
edies room. 
I stutter slightly, my voice lilting with each new and un-
natural apostrophe, but I soon assume the confident speech 
of the spurned son Edgar. I relish the words "grime with 
filth." I sneer and cry in my passionate sorrow. For a mo-
ment, I giggle 
I giggle at King Lear, the mo st tragic of trag-
edies, where calamity is blamed not on witches but on silly 
humans like myself. But I labor to inhabit my lost Edgar 
once again, and disguise myself as Tom O'Bedlam. As I tum 
to my poor, ravaged father, my eyes meet his sockets, and we 
struggle to stay in character. As we embark on our tortured 
path to Dover, somebody yells "Pizza!". 
And we are alone.
