Even Jaguars might be a little too 
modern for Whitlock. "Airplanes, 
automobiles, television... comput-
ers ... they've changed the ·world too 
quickly. It was nice 75 years ago!" 
Seventy-five years ago, Thomas Edi-
son filed his last patent. A half-cen-
tury before~ in 1872, the legendary 
inventor had filed one of his first pat-
ents for a "Type-Writing Machine." 
He was leaping into a competitive 
field; a single standard had not yet 
·emerged. But Edison's design soon 
lost to the Sholes typewriter, the first 
with the QWERTY keyboard. The 
Sholes didn't jam as much as other 
machines, because it was scientifi-
cally engineered to slow our typing, 
by forcing our fingers to hop around 
as much as possible. It has been ham-
penng us ever s1nce. 

Whitlock has outlived most of 
his contemporaries both the type-
writers and the people. His wife, 
Nancy, died a decade ago. Brothers 
Gilbert and Everett both died within 
the last three years, leaving ninety-
three-year-old Reverdy as the only 
one of Whitlock's five brothers still 
alive. Reverdy and Manson used to 
work together at their father's shop, 
though the C.E.H. Whitlock store 
was a New Haven institution long 
before either was born. 

Clifford Everett Hale Whitlock 
started his business out of a bike ga-
rage next door to the Skull and Bones 
tomb. At age 15, he ambitiously 
billed himself "bookseller to Yale." A 
promotional pamphlet from this era 
shows the newly-moved shop, dark

and wood -paneled, every inch the 
ancient general store. It aimed to an-
ticipate all needs 
an advertisement 
reads, "YALE MEN, YOUR TELE-
GRAMS WILL BE RECEIVED 
TILL 8 P.M. AT WHITLOCK'S 
BOOK SHOP." By the time Man-
son Whitlock started working at his 
father's store, it had moved again, 
this time for good, to New Haven's 
main commercial block on Broad-
way Avenue. 

The store always had a big type-
writer section. His father would 
put displays of the mouse-eared 
0 livers in the windows, and some~ 
umes 
a 
company representative 
would come and awe onlookers by 
drawing pictures with the No.5. He 
taught young Whitlock how to draw 
a line of soldiers across the page us-
ing an '0' for the head, a slash for 
the body, hyphens for arms, and a 
caret for legs. "It was pleasing for 
little minds," Whitlock reminisces. 

He was interested in mechanics, so 
when the time came to work in the 
shop, he gravitated toward typewrit-
ers. Having never actually received 
any formal training through classes 
or books, Whitlock learned how to 
complete repairs by "osmosis." 

Reverdy Whitlock took over the 
family bookstore in the forties~ He 
and Manson didn't get along very 
well, and the split, when it came, 
was acrimonious. Reverdy recounts 
coming to the store one Sunday to 
find his brother loading typewriters 
into an old, wood -paneled station 
wagon and moving them to a store-
front around the corner. Neither 
brother likes to talk about that pe-
riod. Manson Whitlock just smiles 
ruefully and says that he has a much 
better relationship with his brother 
now than he did then. The move 
let the typewriter shop expand; at 
its height, Whitlock employed six 
mechanics and stocked four to five 
hundred machines. Success enabled 
him to pick and choose the jobs he 
worked on himself uninterested 
in electric typewriters, he delegated 
them to others and kept the older 
manuals for himself. 

A 1910 Oliver is the oldest ma-
chine that Whitlock keeps in his shop 
today. Although distinguished by its 
years, it is fairly conventional when 
compared to other early typewriter 
designs. There was the Hammonia, 
Germany's first writing machine, 
which looked more like a bread-slic-
er than a typewriter. The Gardner, 
which had fourteen keys that were 
pressed in different "chords" for 
each letter. The Blickensderfer No. 5,

which had keys that stuck out in all 
directions, making it look, in Whit-
lock's words, "sort of like a centi-
pede." And, best of all, the Williams 
had a "grasshopper" type-action in 
which the type-bar leaped up, over, 
and back down onto the platen from 
above as though each depressed key 
propelled an insect into the air. 

Whitlock sold his last six Wil-
liams typewriters when he closed the 
big shop downstairs. Nowadays, de-
spite his objections, he works mostly 
on electric typewriters, which run by 
motor, and electronic typewriters, 
which have computer chips-that's 
all people bring. Today most of the 
half-eaten machines in his shop are 
electrics; the marvels serve only as 
decoration and company. 

One afternoon Whitlock lets me 
take apart an electric Smith-Corona. 
Electric typewriters have motors that 
connect to a spinning, ridged shaft. 
A key, when pressed, catches onto a 
ridge of the shaft, whose spin kicks 
the type-bars forward against the 
page. Whitlock tells me to remove 
the type-bars. They're sort of like 
spring-loaded frog legs, with a slight 
bend halfway down. I try to take one 
out. "Never force anything," Whit-
lock says. Right. I try harder. "You're 
forcing!" He takes it in his fingers 
and, with a flick of his wrist, discon-
nects the bar from its linkage to the 
key. I take the next type-bar and flick 
my wrist. Nothing happens. He takes 
it and, despite his arthritis, humili-
ates me again. I end up having to use 
two bands to remove the bars one by 
one. Whitlock tells me to look at the 
escapement, the jumble of gears that 
moves the carriage from one letter to 
the next. He tells me how it works; 
I am completely lost. He smiles and 
tries to phrase it differently. I poke 
at the escapement with my screw-
driver. He prods it too, didactically, 
and presses the spacebar a few times. 
Finally I understand. It resists the 
carriage's tension; it doesn't actually 
cause movement. A few days after I 
destroyed his typewriter, Whitlock 
tells me that if I had come to his shop 
twenty years ago, he would have giv-
en me a job. 

After my repair lesson, I want a 
typewriter of my own. The next day 
I tell him that I have been looking 
for one on eBay. He has never used 
or even seen the Internet, but bas 
heard of the site and is intrigued. So, 
disregarding the first thing he ever 
told me--"You work a typewriter, 
a computer works you"-1 bring in 
my shiny, silver laptop, and we sit 
down to scope out the market. 'Til 
be darned," he says, when 1,782 items 
pop up. We click the first on the list. 
"The Oliver N°· S's used to have metal 
covers. We'd put them in the chicken 
coop." We return to the list-"1'11 
be darned," he says again, "Let's see 
that Remington. Remington Rand 
N<>- 5 Clumsy, not as nice a feel as 
Royals. " I ask him if he can sec the 
computer well enough. "It's got such 
a clear screen! I had thought it would 
be blurry like a TV!" He smiles and 
looks at the $10.49 Corona N" 3 I've 
clicked. "Goodness gracious. Unbe-
