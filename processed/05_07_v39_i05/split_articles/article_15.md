SUNRISE ON THE RIVER: A QUAINT 
wooden sea wall stands in a spiked 
silhouette; red and white lobster 
boats bob by the dock; delicate blues 
and pinks play on the shimmering 
water. "Good one--for the village 
look," says Bill. His audience, lean-
ing in for a closer look, agrees. You'd 
guess the photograph was of an 
old fishing village, not of the mod-
ern banks of the Quinnipiac just a 
few miles northeast of Yale in Fair 
Haven. 
Bill is one of nine members of 
the Chatham Square photography 
project, which meets in the base-
ment of the tiny Fair Haven public 
library. Some experienced members 
adjust their color schemes on Photo-
shop; others aren't sure how to use 
the flash. All venture out with cam-
eras and a desire to show that Fair 
Haven-specifically, their own nine-
block neighborhood of Chatham 
Square-gets a bad rap. "Yale slams 
this neighborhood all the time," says 
Heather, who took the sunrise pic-
tures. "It's not fair." If Yalies think of 
Fair Haven at all, they probably as-
sociate the neighborhood with drugs 
and prostitution. But the many resi-
dents of Chatham Square are not ones 
to sit back and be dismissed. In the 
past few years, with the help of the 
Community Foundation of Greater 
New Haven, Chatham Square lo-
cals have thrown themselves into the 
work of reviving their neighborhood 
and restoring its image as safe, civic-
minded, and diverse. 
A community historically pop-
ulated by waves of immigrants from 
all over Europe, Latin America, and 
the United States, Chatham Square 
has weathered diverse circumstances: 
once a bustling marketplace, it fell 
into disrepair in the middle of the last 
century and has only recently recov-
ered some of its former vibrancy. A 
large Puerto Rican population of both 
recent immigrants and long time resi-
dents lives side-by-side with eighty-
year-old German immigrants and 
twenty-year-old NYU Art School 
grads. A dual-language public school 
does its best to promote neighbor-
hood unity. The neighborhood hums 
with untold history. 
Determined to preserve-and 
to advertise-the fibric of Chatham 
Square, the Community Foundation 
turned to Andy Horowitz, Yale Class 
of 2003. Horowitz is the founder and 
director of the New Haven Oral His-
tory Project, run out of the Yale His-
tory Department. A stroke of luck 
sent the Community Foundation to 
Horowitz just as he was approached 
by another organization, the under-
graduate Yale Anthropology Society. 
Anthropology majors, chronically 
low on funding for field work, want-
ed hands-on experience, and Cha-
tham Square wanted its stories heard. 
Horowitz brought the two together, 
and the Yale Anthropology Ethnog-
raphy Project was born. 
The Ethnography Project stu-
dents receive training from Horowitz 
in oral history interviewing before 
heading into Chatham Square to re-
cord the stories of its residents. In 
a side project using Sudler funding, 
Yale students formed the Chatham 
Square photography group, which 
equips Chatham locals like Heather 
and Bill with cameras to take pictures 
of their neighborhood. The Ethnog-
raphy Project is planning a local ex-
hibit in early May that will feature the 
highlights of the collected oral histo-
ries and the work of the photography 
group. 
As the interviewers have dis-
covered, however, the people of Cha-
tham Square are not unified in their 
enthusiasm for the neighborhood. 
Some residents speak of the tension 
between English-speaking locals and 
Spanish-speaking immigrants. Not 
everyone, moreover, has opened 
their doors to Yale students with 
tape recorders. While the interview-
ees are diverse in age, language, and 
background, they are a self-selecting 
group. Consequently, the voice of the 
neighborhood is coming from those 
who care about it most. Chatham 
Square activists "want to show off 
their neighborhood," says Horow-
itz. They are interested not only in 
recording the area's history but mar-
keting it to potential homebuyers. As 
students gain field experience and 
locals build a potential promotional 
tool, a particular version of Chatham 
Square history emerges. This sense of 
history, while perhaps biased towards 
the positive, offers new pride to a 
community on the brink of revival. 
Chatham Square is starting to 
come to terms with its identity. Back 
in the library basement, Heather's 
husband shows the group his own 
shot of dawn on the Quinnipiac Riv-
er. On the left, an old-fashioned lan-
tern glows against a clapboard house. 
Across the top of the picture runs a 
jagged black tangle of electrical wires, 
cutting into the perfect silver of the 
sky. "It's too bad about those wires," 
a woman sighs. The group contem-
plates the shot in silence; maybe the 
wires could be cropped out. Then: "I 
don't know ... maybe not," someone 
says, and others start to speak up, too. 
The diverse elements bring balance 
to the composition; they make a nice 
contrast against the pale sky. Besides, 
someone points out, this is a picture 
of a real place, and the wires are re-
ally there. Yes, the group agrees: the 
wires stay.
