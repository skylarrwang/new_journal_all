On the table lies a mess of DVDs, cere-

THE STAFF AT THE YALE CoLLECTION 
of Musical Instruments likes to tell a 
story about a nine-year-old boy who 
approached the single-manual harp-
sichord available for public use on 
the second floor of the Collection 
and began to play a Bach Fugue. This 
came as something of a surprise to the 
boy's parents, who had never heard 
him play a single note. Their child, it 
turned out, had been learning to play 
at a neighbor's house. 
Resting one hand on the same 
harpsichord, Susan E. Thompson, the 
Collection's curator, tells this story 
with an air of satisfaction. Near her 
sit a 1736 Stradivarius violin, a grand 
piano that Wagner used for a decade, 
and two small epinettes that might

Thompson, holding a cup of tea, ges-
tures toward the piano. It is tiny, with 
narrow keys, perfect for a woman 
with exceptionally small hands and 
a light, practiced touch. "We call this 
the eggshell instrument," she says in a 
soft voice before removing the protec-
tive case and playing a few notes. The 
sound that comes out is delicate; her 
fingers no more than graze the keys. 
Such musical gems seem in-
congruous in the former fraternity 
house on 15 Hillhouse that holds 
the instruments. The Collection be-
gan in 1900 with a gift from Morris 
Steinert, a local piano merchant and 
founder of the New Haven Sym-
phony Orchestra. To thank the Uni-
versity for allowing the Symphony 
to rehearse on campus, Steinert do-
nated a number of keyboards which 
were originally displayed in Wool-
sey Hall as the first Yale Collection 
of Musical Instruments. 
The Collection's second major 
donor watches over the instruments 
from a painting that hangs on the sec-
ond floor. Belle Skinner, depicted in 
a red dress with her sister Katharine, 
was a Holyoke textile heiress whose 
nephews attended Yale. Aside from 
donating several instruments to Yale's 
Collection, Skinner was responsible 
for moving the Collection to its pres-
ent location. 
The building on Hillhouse gave 
the Collection a space in which it could 
come alive, a place where instruments 
could be seen and heard. Thompson 
raises her arm high above her head, 
notes the great acoustics in the space, 
and snaps. Pleased with the full sound 
her fingers make, she continues walk-
ing around the room, which houses a 
permanent exhibit of keyboard instru-
ments widely regarded as the jewel of 
the collection. 
The second floor exhibit visu-
ally summarizes the keyboard's his-
tory. Thompson's discussion of the 
instruments with NicholasRenouf, the 
congenial Associate Curator, makes it 
evident that no one piece exists in iso-
lation. Each is tied to an ancestor and 
an heir, an important predecessor and 
a later imitation. Instruments in the 
Collection are displayed not only as art 
objects, but also as historical records. 
When asked about Wagner's piano, 
Renouf presents a thorough history of 
the instrument's precedent and its di-
rect descendent, which Wagner called 
the instrument of his dreams. 
To the untrained eye, however, 
the evolution and importance of cer-
tain instruments is not immediately 
apparent. Some displays have almost 
universal appeal; the recorder-like 
tonette, "America's favorite pre-band 
instrument," catches every visitor's 
eye. Its display case, sprinkled with 
clippings 
from 
"Tonette 
News," 
gives such valuable advice as "Don't 
blow your instrument in class while 
the teacher is talking." 
A current exhibit of bells from 
around the world is also popular, dis-
playing everything from Japanese 
temple bells, to French table bells 
(one of which is shaped like Napo-
leon), to a book entitled "The Art of 
Ringing, "whichcontains,amongother 
things, obituaries of bell carillonneurs. 
The quieter, grander exhibits, though, 
aren't very accessible, as the textual 
explanation accompanying each in-
strument is short. 
Thompson and Renouf both 
want to incorporate more explana-
tory text and even a sound system to 
accompany the instruments, but the 
building's small size makes the cura-
tors' availability to visitors important. 
Not all of the instruments can be on 
display at any given time, so their cu-
rators emphasize quality over quan-
tity. "There has never been any desire 
forcomprehension, "Renoufsays. "The 
instruments in the Collection are all 
superb examples." However superb, 
though, the Collection's limited hours 
make it difficult for the public to gain 
access. It exists as a compromise be-
tween museum and special collection. 
While the British Art Center and the 
Peabody hold more open hours, most 
of the University's specialized hold-
ings are open only through appoint-
ment and have no exhibits. 
Interim Director Leon Plantinga 
and InternElizabeth Weinfield arehelp-
ing Thompson and Renouf expand the 
scope of visitors. The Collection al-
ready serves as a resource for music 
students, and art classes visit periodi-
cally to sketch the instruments. Even-
tually, the staff envisions art openings, 
talks, and other events to attract more 
undergraduates. Another promising 
idea is a composition contest open to 
the School of Music in which students 
would use instruments in the Collec-
tion as inspiration for a musical piece. 
The Collection is also open to 
the public through its concert series, 
which takes advantage of the marvel-
ous acoustics that Thompson praises. 
The keyboards on the second floor 
rest on rolling platforms that allow the 
gallery to be transformed into a hun-
dred-seat concert hall. These concerts 
are often performed on restored in-
struments from the Collection. As the 
concert musicians begin, history ani-
mates, as unexpected and delightful 
as a Bach Fugue played by a secretly 
musical nine-year-old boy.
