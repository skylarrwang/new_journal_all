EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
to get them excited, and Scott is good 
at his job. Like forty thousand other 
college students in the United States 
and Canada, Scott is a representative 
of Cutco Cutlery, a massive knife-
selling corporation that grosses $144 
million ~n domestic sales each year. 
In the summer of 2005, Scott sold 
thirty thousand dollars' worth of 
Cutco products. 

First formed in 1949, Cutco is 
now paired with Vector Marketing 
as a subsidiary of Alcas Corporation. 
Cutco succeeds in part because of 
the quality of its products, but l;ugely 
because of its relentless recruitment 
of ambitious young salespeople. The 
company seizes and profits off their 
new representatives' social networks, 
telling employees to "sell to everyone 
you know. "Beginning representatives 
are responsible for 75% of Cutco's 
sales, though most quickly exhaust 
their contact lists and enthusiasm. 

In a throwback to the days of 
Arthur Miller, the upper-middle class 
teenagers who form the bulk of Cut-
co's sales team travel to homes, make 
light conversation with their hosts, 
and then casually invite themselves 
into the kitchen cabinets, where they 
discover the horror of dull knives and 
wooden handles. Scott tells his cus-
tomers to "have fun spending five 
years cutting your steak tonight" and 
informs them that, with all the bacte-
ria in a wooden handle, they may as 
well feed the bubonic plague to their 
children. He then performs a series 
of choreographed and impressive 
demonstrations, a cost comparison, 
and a package pitch, invariably sell-
ing a few knives or, at the very least, 
an ice cream scoop. Emphasizing the 
value of personal charisma, Scott ad-
vises future representatives, "You bet-
ter believe that if your customer has 
kids, you're on the floor playing with 
those babies and making them love 
you." Though this tactic stretches the 
traditional forms of solicitation, the 
cutlery giant continues to reel in bud-
ding professionals of college age with 
a polished image of enterprise. 

The triumph of Vector Market-
ing, more than its ability to script 
clever presentations, is in its success 
in understanding our generation. Sar-
ah Andrus, the director of academic 
programs at Vector Marketing, cites a 
number of studies that her firm uses 
to effectively recruit salespeople from 
the 18-24 age bracket. Speaking with 
a combination of masterful articula-
tion and anecdotes, Andrus relates 
that "entrepreneurship" is on the rise 
in Generation Y, a phenomenon that 
she breathlessly describes as "just 
wonderful." Cu teo has no trou blefind-
ing representatives on college cam-
puses, she explains, because it un-
derstands that students need "instant 
gratification" and relish the thought 
of self-made success. Homemakers 
and weekend barbecues fuel the con-
sumption of Cutco's cutlery, but it is 
the young sellers who tirelessly push 
it forward. 

Dan Carey, a professor of social 
psychology at Notre Dame Univer-
sity who us-es Cutco in his discussion 
of savvy compliance techniques, be-
lieves the cutlery giant's business 
strategy "reads like a social psychol-
ogy text book." Discussing Cutco 
provokes immediate reactions from 
his students, since many own Cutco 
knives or have worked for the com-
pany in the past. Carey explains that 
Vector Marketing's appeal is often 
based on its flashy presentation. 

For KevinChiu,aSaybrookfresh-
man who sold Cutco knives last sum-
mer, the recruiting process began 
when a little girl danced around his 
high school graduation with a basket 
of Vector Marketing recruiting infor-
mation. The materials she gave him 
contained few direct references to 
cutlery, and the interview and train-
ing process consisted of clean-cut 
professionals pitching an exciting op-
portunity to earn money and improve 
his transcript. At Scott's branch, repre-
sentatives galvanized the trainees by 
running into the room at choice mo-
ments and yellingupdates: "Kathy just 
made $350! Tom did $800!" Elated by 
the style and polish of the company, 
many new representatives become 
instantly loyal. In this early stage of 
Cutco courtship, Scott recalls feeling 
"like you are a part of this bustling lit-
tle operation, even if you don't know 
what it is." 

Eventually, experienced trainers 
bring out the knives, detail the script-
ed phone calls, and outline the one-
hour in-horne presentations. While 
young salespeople initially enter the 
Cutco world intoxicated by its refined 
image, the company's complicated 
system of hierarchies, rankings, and 
promotions keeps them among the 
Cutco faithful. Both Chiu and Scott 
outdid their rivals, selling enough 
knives to climb in" commission brack-
ets." They speak reverently of the top 
levelsof"FieldServiceMangers." Chiu 
describes how weekly Cutco newslet-
ters listing national rankings of sales-
people stoked his competitive nature, 
and Scott mentions the looming 
perks of successful sales. "Selling is 
addictiveforme, "Scottexplains. "They 
always have these promos-contests, 
conferences, and events that keep 
you going. They have all these levels-
you want to be 'keystaff,'whichliteral-
ly means that you just get a key to put 
on your shirt.'' Despite the startlingly 
dull nature of the product, the allure 
of briefcases, pinstripes, and promo-
tions seizes the ambitious minds of 
college-age men and women. 

Rosa Ayala, a Davenport sopho-
more who raked in eight thousand 
dollars during het Cutco summer and 
has since been promoted to manage-
ment, recognizes the Cutco stigma 
but sees the income as a means to an 
end. While other Yalies truck them-
selves to internships around the coun-
try, where they break countless fax 
machines and learn to conceal their 
Face book voyeurism, Rosa points out 
that the Cutco system mixes personal 
interaction with rewards and recogni-
tion. "I want to be a teacher,'' she says, 
"and I plan to use every bit of what I 
make from Cutco." Yet her ambition 
does not imply a lack ofloyalty. "Ilove 
the product," she explains. "I wouldn't 
be doing sales if I didn't." 

Scott is similarly enthusiastic 
about bringing knives to the door-
steps of America." I love this company," 
he grins, "even though everyone from 
the top down knows it's a -scam.~'
