and techno to Connecticut. With his 
fresh Chicago sound and an intuitive 
sense of how to move the crowd, Joe 
started Riot at the Municipal, a party 
so popular that it was featured on 
the cover of the Hartford Advocate 
in 1989. The headline read "Bring-
ing Down the House: The Mu-
nicipal Restaurant is home to Riot, 
Hartfo"rd's new, cutting-edge 'acid 
house' night club." Riot soon found 
its own venue. As co-owner and DJ, 
Joe was a local sensation, getting the 
crowd off three nights a week and 
even bringing the after-hours scene 
back to the floor he rented in his co-
owner's place. He was at the van-
guard of a dance craze reminiscent of 
the legendary disco era. "I suspect 
that the big difference between the 
'90s and now is that there was more 
spectacle then," says Arnott. "There 
were warehouses being rented out 
for big spectacular dance parties." 


People did Ecstasy and danced un-
til dawn. These were the later glory 
days of dance music . 


Soon, Joe began to ·get noticed 
outside of Connecticut. He opened Riot 
New York and Riot Atlanta, and even 
traveled overseas in 2003 and 2004 to 
do a series of club tours. "In Spain," he 
says, "people would come up and ask 
me for my autograph." Europeans still 
idolize even the unknown D J. 


But ~ack in the States, many DJs 
lead double lives, find tninor success, 
and then lose it. Three years after in-
ternational recognition, Joe is back at 
Alchemy, tnaking a living. DJ Rob has 
a day job, a wife, and three kids. "My 
passion is not to sell telecommunica-
tions services to large corporations," he 
saysofhisworkatAT&TinFarmington, 
Connecticut. If the DJs go unnoticed 
by night, then by day they are unde-
tectable. 


Joe hopes to achieve notoriety by 
teaming up with Rob in a production 
teamtheycall "Rejexx." The two work 
out of a spare bedroom in Rob's house 
and attempt to do what the big boys 
do make music. These days, fame 
as a DJ depends on music produc-

tion, which gets you noticed by the 
industry and courted by musicians 
and clubs. Joe's five minutes of fame 
was next to nothing compared to 
today's number one DJ, Tiesto, a true 
artist who sells millions of records and 
playstosold-outstadiums. Rejexxhas 
posted several tracks it produced on 
itswebsite. Thenewest, "Do You Want 
Me?" is described as "featuring syn-
copated percussion, chopped up fe-
male vocals, and an old-school house 
bass line." Rob and Joe gave out some 
demo CDs at a music conference last 
year and plan to distribute more in 
the upcoming months. Most of all, 
Joe wants to see the tracks on vinyl. A 
CD just goes in a pile, but vinyl says it 
like the song with some soul. 


Joe has aspirations of starting his 
own label. Though sometin1es with-
drawn, he has always made good busi-
ness decisions and has two gold re-
cords to show for it. But fame is fickle, 
and today, Joe is back spinning inN ew 
Haven and Hartford. Like any Ameri-
can dreamer, he wants more. 


"Where I want~ to be, is to do 
music full-time," says Mark. "I re-
ally want to be a DJ worldwide, and 
I know I can do it. DJing, retoix-
ing, producing. Time is so limited."

He says this somewhat mournfully. 
He is sitting at a table at Bar eating 
pizza topped with mashed potatoes 
and bacon and drinking Coca-Cola. 
Though he's faced with a half-empty 
garage and a half-eaten pizza, this 
middle-aged man with his middle-
aged dream is someone you want to 
believe in. 


''Salt and pepper hair and grease 
in his fingen1ails," says Ron LeDuc, a 
friend of Mark who works the door at 
Bar, '~[but he] fucking gets in there and

fucks it up." LeDuc designs Mark's 
business cards, website, and CDs, all 
of which feature a cartoon logo of a 
sexpot female mechanic. He is quick 
to talk Mark up, but not without 
good reason. In the DJ room, Mecha-
nix mixes sweet beats. 


~~He"s fucking phenomenal,"'"' 
LeDuc continues, getting noticeably 
excited. "He's so smooth; -I've seen 
him spin 2 CDs and a fucking turn-
table at the same time. Are you kid-
ding me? That's fucking nuts.'' 


t's true that Joe came closer to 
fame, but when it comes down to 
it, he and Mark are two DJs, work-
ing one block away from each other 
and fighting for the same prize. In a 
city satisfied by a soundtrack to beer, 
Joe and Mark are underappreciated 
and anonymous to most. But they 
will keep their day jobs and keep on _ 
spinning. Because when you have a 
dream and nothing to lose, you go 
for it. You hand out your business 
card. Give away CDs. Put contacts 
_on the guest list. You call back. You 
play on. Anything to get noticed.
