apartments in the metropolitan centers. Some have never 
attended a creative writing class. Others have already 
composed award-winning plays. 

In some ways, the TASP application process is 
equally, if not more, competitive than those of the top 
universities most TASP students will later attend. Appli-
cations are mailed to those who score in the 99th percentile 
of the PSAT, although high sch~ol teachers can recom-
mend outstanding students to the program and a recent 
change in policy allows highly motivated prospective at-
tendees to download the application and go it alone. To 
enter a TASP classroom, applicants must write six lengthy 
essays and undergo rigorous interviews. About seventy 
students are accepted to the program at the end of this 
long process, and all of them are awarded a scholarship 
to attend one of five seminars held at colleges around the 
country. These classes cover topics such as "The Dilem-
ma of Modernism," "The Battle of the Sexes in Medieval 
and Renaissance Literature," "Race, Class, and Gender in 
British and American History," "War, Violence, and Sto-
rymaking," and "The Mystery of Creativity" -titles that 
could be lifted from many a university course catalogue. 

A hefty handful of TASP alumni matriculate at 
Yale each fall, and many grace the ranks of Directed 
Studies, a selective freshman program that takes a writ-
ing-intensive and interdisciplinary approach to the study 
of the Western Canon. They are well-prepared. Thanks 
to TASP, these students have already shared a house, man-
aged a collective budget, and been tutored by renowned 
professors. Joshua Garcia, a Yale sophomore who attended 
TASP at Cornell in 2004, looked back on his experience, 
saying, "It was one of the most intense intellectual experi-
ences I ever had and that I will have." 

As a former TASP student myself, I recognize the deep 
intellectual awakening, the feeling of academic possibility 
that the program inspires. I have also come to accept its 
inherent transience. Now, I wonder if it is healthy for these 
bright minds to arrive at college with soaring intellectual 
expectations that are almost bound to be dashed by the 
university system. After all, it seems unnatural for a fresh-
man to enter a world of education less ideal and less iso-
lated than the one he or she had previously encountered. I 
find myself questioning the advantage of the fragile state 
of enlightenment the program offers its attendees. Is this 
singular scholarly community too unreal to be of value? 


All students who participate in TASP quickly embrace 
their new identities as "TASPers," hoping to gain 
what the official 2007 brochure calls "a sense of intellec-
tual purpose and community responsibility." Described 
in promotional materials as "semi-monastic," the TASP 
program discourages participants from associating with 
anyone outside the community for the duration of the 
program in order to foster an undistracted dedication to 
the spirit of the experience. The program is also described 
as "semi-autonomous," and, in many ways, every TASP 
group runs itself. TASPers meet once a week for a "town 
meeting" to discuss issues of communal relevance, allo-

cate funds, and plan social activities. 

TASPers also shoulder kitchen duties, 
chores, and other household respon-
sibilities. They. quickly realize that 
th~ , quality of their summer experi-
ence, both intellectually and socially, 
depends heavily on their individual 
contributions to the community. 

TASP is a branch of the Tellu-
ride Association, which was· founded 
in 1911 by ·Lucien L. Nunn, a min-
ing engineer who made it big in the 
mineral-ri'?h Rockies. Nunn, hop-
ing to educate the young men who 
worked for him, dedicated his for-
tune to the Telluride Association and · 
Deep Springs College. On its website, 
the Association defines itself as "a 
nonprofit organization that creates 
and fosters educational communities 
that ·rely upon democratic participa-
tion.'~ Telluride's mission is complex: 
it aims at an "everyday synthesis of 
self-governance and intellectual in-
quiry that enables students to devel-
op their potential for leadership and · 
public service.'' TASPers are often 
reminded of this philosophy by their 
paid "factota" 
one or two college 
or graduate students who live and at-
tend classes with each seminar group. 

Far from traditional camp counsel-
ors, the factota live up to their Latin 
names 
c'those who do everything." 

In addition to attending seminar with 
the students, the factota help them 
· with their papers and often become 
close with their summer wards, fill-
ing the roles. of sibling, coach, mentor, 
and friend. 

For many of its participants, TASP 
offers a six-week utopia for nerdy, 
tortured teens who prefer poetry read-
ings to pep rallies: "People need TASP 
to get away from the real world," said 
Emma Griffin, a TASPer and current 
Yale freshman. Griffin recognizes the 
surreal elements of the TASP experi-
ence, but maintains that the students 
who participate in it are hungry for an 
intellectual and social experience un-
available to them in high school. Intel-
lectualism, especially in an American 
grade school, can lead to profound 
alienation. By contrast, these small 
conununities of adolescent intellectu-
als take on the character of Thoreau's 
Walden as their members attempt to 
build an insular, erudite existence that 
is not only mentally superior, hut al-
together separate from their quotid-
ian lives. Tae-Yeoun Keum, a junior, 
believes that highly creative minds 
lead lives that are "very solitary, very 
lonely, very terrifying." TASP gave 
Keum what she called the "greatest 
kind of support: to know that you are 
not alone." 

This communal feeling of dis-
placement facilitates an oddly powerful 
sense of trust among TASPers. There is 
a sense of confidence that fosters per-
sonal exposure and rapid intellectual 
development. Both seminar and daily 
routines are characterized by intima-
tions of deep connection; TASPers re-
ally are there to help one another. Junior 
Jacob Eigen, an alumnus of both TASP 
and Deep Springs, felt extremely isolat-
ed as a high school student and found 
a novel sense of community during his 
Telluride sutnmer. "TASP was really 
the one thing I did in high school that 
made me want to spend time with other 
people ... whatever personal trust took 
place had to do with whatever intellec-
tual trust was there." Stacey Fitzgerald, 
a sophomore, expressed a similar opin-
ion. "When I went to TASP, I spoke 
more freely that I ever have .... There 
was nothing wrong with being wrong." 

This openness stems from the 
deep respect TASPers feel for their 
companions. Such regard derives in 
part from · the students' awareness 
of the admissions criteria, which fo-
cus not only on intellectual prowess 
but also on personal maturity and 
self-awareness. Matt Morello, who 
graduated from Yale in 2004, wrote 
of his TASP experience ih an e-mail, 
recalling that cc most of all, the other 
kids were so amazingly smart and 
curious 
I felt awfully lucky to have 
made it there, not to mention freed 
by the blank slate to be myself, and 
motivated like maybe never before 
or again to prove and define myself 
in the context of that group." Many 
TASPers believe that the students sit-
ting across from thenr in seminar are 
the most intelligent and interesting 
people they have ever encountered. 

Elis, too, are often filled with awe of 
their peers. Sylvia Bingham, a sopho-
more, said that "everyone poo-poos 
the pretentious and elitist aspects of 
TASP, but Yale has the same appeal. 
They are both so competitive that you 
end up with only the most dynamic 
people who care about academics." 

Garcia believes early submersion in


this culture of excellence may, ironi-
cally, leave TASPers more level-head-
ed than their current classmates. "[I 
learned] to accept my own merits 
because of who I am, not because of 
my talents. I was not the only talented 
person ... You have a few crises, asking 
yourself, 'Who am I? I am nothing.'" 

TASP, of course, is just a sum-
mer endeavor, and, like any other 
camp, it inevitably comes to an end as 
TASPers disband and return to their 
respective high schools for their senior 
year. Most TASPers find this transi-
tion difficult. Keum admitted that 
"TASP made senior year unbearable." 

Liz Tulis, a Yale graduate student and 
College alumna who attended TASP 
in 1996, recalled that her last year of 
high school was characterized by a 
"shadow life" of nearly daily e-mail ex-
changes with her closest TASP friends. 

If TASPers find it difficult to relate to 
their peers before leaving for Cornell 
or UT Austin, they become even more 
disoriented after their summers away 
from home. Morello reflects, "How, 
after all, is real life supposed to com-
pete with six weeks of dawn-busting, 
17 -year-old-soul-baring 
conversa-
tions? Ultimately, of course, real life 
won, but goddarnn if that didn't take 
a while."' Many TASPers spend their 
senior year in furious anticipation of 
college, which they hope will provide 
a kind of reincarnation of TASP. 

Whether or not this rebirth 
comes to fruition-whether college 
can best, or even match, TASP's intel-
lectual intensity-is often question-
able. Griffin chose to come to Yale be-
cause ofTASP-she believed that Elis 
"were the most similar to TASPers and 
felt the same way about knowledge."' 

At the same time, she did not expect 
Yale to be TASP. "I didn't have a dis-
appointment in comparison to TASP. 
They are different experiences." 

Many alumni, unable to avoid 
comparing the two scholastic 
ventures, notice a void in their intel-
lectual and social lives at Yale that was 
filled at TASP. Garcia expected his ex-
periences in writing classes to be like 
TASP, but now knows that TASP-
style workshopping "won't happen 


again."' He says, "My intellectual ex-
perience at Yale is very rushed,"' said 
Garcia, who deplored the discrepancy 
between the two hours a week de-
voted to seminars in college and the 
daily three-.hour classes he enjoyed 
that summer. "At TASP, we had op-
portunities to talk about everything." 

Fitzgerald agreed that her intellectual 
expectations were deflated at Yale. 
"TASP," she said, "idealized the aca-
demic life." 

Most TASPers search for traces 
of their cultish summer bliss at Yale. 
"Of course I looked for TASP at Yale," 
Morello wrote. "It was the only taste 
of collegiate, academic, non-home life 
I'd yet had." Many turn to Directed 
Studies, hoping to find three year-
long TASP seminars. Keum found 
that the intensive freshman program 
and TASP are, in some ways, similar 
programs. "At TASP, everywhere I 
went, I could see people working." At 
Yale, these kindred spirits exist-in 
the library. "There was one day when 
I was in the Newspaper Room in 
Sterling reading Dostoevsky. All of a 
sudden, I looked up and saw another 
DSer across from me at the table. He 
had his Dostoevsky in front of him 
and his Nietzsche beside it. Our eyes 
met in profound Dostoevsky-ian em-
pathy." This kind of solidarity-the 
sense that everyone is collectively 
banging their brains against difficult 
texts-characterizes both TASP and 
certain tightly-knit classes at Yale. 

Nevertheless, Keum described her 
TASP seminar as something Yale has 
yet to match. While she spent much 
of Directed Studies "too scared tore-
flect," TASP offered "a center that we 
all contributed to." 

While TASP readied its students 
for their coursework, it could 
not prepare 'them for the social atmo-
sphere at Ya]e. Bingham feels that her 
experience at Yale lacks the particu-
lar closeness that TASP engenders. "I 
thought Yale would force me to get 
to know people who were different 
from me." She was disappointed. "I 
still feel like my circle of friends is 
very predictable."' 

Bingham also noted that the 
culture of TASP was notable for its 
lack of debauchery. "At TASP, there 
was no drinking, no sex, no alcohol. 
The monasticism was particularly 
great. Here, there is such a bouooary 
between people who drink, have sex, 
flirt and those who don't. At TASP, 
there was a sense that everyone should 
contribute to everyone's education." 

"On weekend nights at TASP," Garcia 
recalled, "we didn't go out. We didn't 
get drunk. We talked to each other all 
night. This doesn't really happen here." 

Morello paints a similarly stark 
picture of Yale's crowded social scene. 
"I don't think I was disappointed by 
Yale so much as overwhelmed, • he 
said. "Neither TASP nor my small pri-
vate high school had prepared me for 
anything like the ass-and-booze fes-
tival of Camp Yale ... I feel like I had 
to junk whatever expectations for col-
lege I'd formed at TASP within a few 
days or weeks of starting actual col-
lege-friends, freedom, and work at 
Yale were part of a much longer haul in 
a much bigger, more diverse place. • 

For young intellectuals, how 
can any experience possibly match the 
ecstasy of a summer spent living and 
learning with smart, thoughtful peers, 
at the developmental fulcrum that is 
late adolescence? 

Many TASPers derive satisfaction 
from the way in which TASP, while a 
fleeting experience, has permanently 
changed them. "What TASP gave me 
more than an expectation of the world 
was a vision of myself, a sense of what 
I could be," said Keum. "I was close to 
my ideal self, being able to throw my-
self so completely and passionately into 
something I was doing. When I was 
leaving TASP, I shared a cab with two 
other TASPers. We were silent and then 
gradually realized we were all thinking 
the same thing: I do not want to return 
to my old mundane self ... here, we 
don't have the social support to do that 
again. But it doesn't matter, I don't 
think, as long as you know you are 
capable of it. It is in some ways a lost 
golden age.•
