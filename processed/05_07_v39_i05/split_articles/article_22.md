**Last Taps of the Typewriter**
**Author: Michael Birnbaum**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

Manson H. Whitlock peers into the typewriter on the table, a big, avo-
cado-green IBM Selectric from the sixties. Something is jammed and 
pieces are scattered around the machine. Eventually, Whitlock finds 
what he's looking for-a screw has fallen in, causing the type mechanism to 
stick. Out goes the screw. Using a spring-hook, an implement that would be 
more at home in a dentist's office than a Dell factory, he reassembles the type-
writer-plastic cover plates, the metal paper tray that directs paper onto the 
main roller, and the cylindrical rubber plate itself. Then he taps some keys, ex-
amining how each letter moves. "Good enough. For government standards 
anyhow." He draws a smiley-face on the repair order, gazes through the window 
at the late-autumn leaves blowing outside, and calls the client on his old black 
rotary phone. 

Whitlock is 89, and, though he looks younger, his tweed jacket, silk tie, and 
sweater betray him as a man from a different era. The only thing missing is a 
pipe, though an orange typewriter-shaped ashtray sits empty on the shelf; four 
or five years ago he quit smoking, worried that he would die young. His face 
is lined and friendly, crowned by thinning, combed-back hair that recalls Lyn-
donJohnson's without the grease. The ring and pinkie fingers of his right hand 
are twisted with arthritis, but that doesn't keep him from his job. Though he's 
slightly stooped and often uses a cane, he still moves a heavy typewriter with 
ease. Whitlock has probably been repairing typewriters longer than anyone 
else in the Northeast, maybe even the United States. When he started in 1930, 
Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight was a fresh memory, Herbert Hoover 
was president, and construction of the Empire State Building had just begun. 

These days his shop is jammed with tools, books, machines, and memo-
ries that have accumulated over the last 76 years. After his 1990 "retirement," 
when he moved from the larger storefront to a tiny outpost upstairs, Whit-
lock filled a dumpster with typewriters and flotsam. What remains are the 
survivors. Shelves line the sides of the shop, laden with enough ribbons to 
supply David lve's monkeys on their near-eternal quest to recreate the com-
plete works of Shakespeare. A bust of Mark Twain (the first author to turn 
in a typed manuscript) sits on a bookcase, an old prize for having been the 
highest-grossing Smith-Corona dealer in the Northeast. On another shelf are 
repair catalogues, A Treasury of jewish Humor, the 1978 New Haven tele-
phone directory, and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's The Physiology of Taste. 
There are boxes full of platens, type-balls, type-slugs, and type-bars. 

And of course there are the typewriters themselves, which sit in various 
states of disrepair. Some gleam as they might have in 1920. Others, victims of 
cannibalization, have been dissected to feed the cravings of clients' machines. 
THE NEw JouRNAL 

Typewriter repair is a delicate 
business. 

Their covers are open, exposing mouth-
fuls of thin metal teeth. There is an old 
black Underwood, the kind you'd see in 
a Howard Hawks movie. A German, sky-
blue Olympia built like a tank. Seven 
strains of electric Smith-Corona, four 
breeds of IBM Selectric, and one exotic 
old Oliver No.5, with its clustered type-
bars poking up like mouse ears on either 
side of the platen roller. 

Whitlock says that he has repaired 
around three hundred thousand type-
writers in his career. The avocado IBM 
was job number 300,001. "If you put the 
typewriters I've repaired end to end it 
would take days to drive past them," he 
boasts. Indeed, if each of those typewrit-
ers were fourteen inches long, together 
they would form a line of 795 miles, or 
just about the distance between Chicago 
and New York. Drive your car however 
fast you want. 

The fastest Whitlock has ever driven 
was 110 miles an hour in a brand-new 
1946 Packard with overdrive, a gift from 
his father-in-law. At that rate, he would 
have driven past his line of typewriters 
in seven hours and fourteen minutes. He 
says his sons don't like typewriters "be-
cause you can't go 'vroom vroom' with 
them," and sometimes he feels the same 
way. A small chrome clock salvaged from 
the dashboard of a 1953 Jaguar XK120 
sits on his work table; it loses about a 
minute a week but is otherwise reliable. 
The Jaguar lives on in Whitlock's memory 
and in a painting in his living room; he 
sold the car itself to pay his wife's medi-
cal bills.
