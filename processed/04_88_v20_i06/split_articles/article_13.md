**Understanding Autism**

A boy sits in a park under the watchful 
eye of a middle-aged man. Gradually, 
the child becomes agitated. He moans, 
waving his arms in the air frantically. 
The man leaps up, grabs the boy, and 
forces his arms down, but the child 
continues to thrash about. A passing 
stranger looks 
on, 
horrified.

know what autistic means." 

It means everything to Weeks, 
supervisor at Benhaven, which is 
institution for autistic children 
adulu. But the teachers and 
visors at Benhaven's residences 
schools a.re 
accustomed to 


ignorance of autism. The syndrome 
was only recognized in 1943, by 
Harvard psychiatrist Leo Kanner. He 
named the condition "autism" because, 
as he observed at the time, "There is 
from the start an extreme autistic 
aloneness that, whenever possible, 
disregards, ignores, shuts out anything 
that comes to the child from the out-
side." This social impenetrability is still 
widely considered 
to be 
autism's 
distinguishing feature. 

Most autistic children also display 
ritualistic, 
self-stimulating motions. 
These include prolonged rocking back 
and forth, frantic hand gestures, or 
simply shouting and running about 
wildly. In its most extreme form, this 
self-stimulation can turn into self-
abuse. When "tantruming," autistic 
children may hit themselves or bang 
their heads against a wall. 

Experts in the fifti~s and sixties saw 
autism as a psychological problem, 
brought on by deficient parenting. 
Psychologist Brunb Bettelheim's 
influential book, The Empty Fortress, 
espoused such treatments as increased 
hugging, or even separation of the 
child from the parent held respon-
sible- most frequently the mother 
Proponents of these therapies felt that 
they could cure an autistic child. 

Researchers today generally eschew 
the blame-the-parent approach and are 
exploring possible biological and 
chemical causes. 

Presently, 
these 
doctors feel that the condition cannot 
be cured. 

Autism is rare, affiicting only four or 
five out of every 10,000 children. Most 
are boys. All autistic children are 
either born with the syndrome or con-
tract it during their first year of life. 
Parents frequently have great difficulty 
caring for an autistic child at home, 
and the experience of one parent led to 
the creation of Benhaven. Amy Let-
tick, who founded the institution in 
1968, named it for her autistic son, 
Ben. In seeking help for him, she had 
found that few organizations existed 
for autistic people. This changed with 
the passage of the Education for 
Handicapped Children Act in 1975. 
Household tasks like preparing dinner are part of behavior therapy. 
The legislation requires that every 
school district in the United States 
provide free and appropriate education 
for all children, regardless of handicap, 
in order to receive vital federal funds. 
Programs for autisti~ children are 
more common today. Still, Benhaven 
remains unique in its size and scope; it 
is the only organization of its kind. in 
Connecticut, as well as one of the most 
respected in the nation. The residents 
and students range from young chil-
dren to adults in their thirties, and they 
function at many different levels, both 
socially and intellectually. Most are 
not simply autistic, but also retarded. 
Others, who do not display the stan-
dard autistic behavior, may show a few 
symptoms such as ritualistic motion. 
Benhaven has four branches: a main 
group of residences in an isolated area 
of North Haven; the Charles H. Ora-
zen adult workshop near New Haven's 
industrial Forbes Avenue; a school in 
Wallingford; and a small residence, 
Medalie House, for high-functioning, 
autistic people. These sites are all 
staffed by trained teachers as well as 
volunteers. Medical treatments, such 
as the administration of drugs, are 
provided by doctors from the Child 
Study Center, a branch of the Yale 
psychology department, which has 
been linked to Benhaven since it 
opened. 

The center also runs a class, offered 
through Yale, in which students vol-
unteer at one of the residences or 
schools. 
Psychology major Katy 
Schneebaum (PC '89), who went on to 
work at Benhaven for a summer after 
taking the class, admits that a full-time 
job there can be draining. "Even 
though Benhaven gets amazing results, 
it's still on a relative scale," she says. 
"My conception of what success meant 
really changed while working there. 
Success for these kids could mean 
making a bed." The constant frus-
trations and 
repetitiOUS behavior 
therapy tax all Benhaven employees, 
and not surprisingly, there is a high 
turnover rate. Still, those who have 
stayed point to one overriding reason: 
They love the kids. 

The pastoral setting of "the farm," 
Benhaven's principle branch in North 
Haven, consists of several ranch-type 
dwellings surrounded by woods. Each 
residence houses a different age group: 
Baker House is primarily for young 
children, Nakash House for adol-
escents, and Rosenberg House for 
adults. Another house, johnson, is 
kept locked, 
because 
it contains 
"runners" who will take any oppor-
tunity to run away. 

Both N akash and Baker, the chil-
dren's homes, are notably spare inside; 
bedrooms contain few 
furnishings 
except chairs covered with plastic and 
pictures screwed into the wall. In one 
child's room, the closet door is tied 
shut. Linda Simonson, the program 
and staff coordinator, explains that the 
children sometimes urinate onto their 
clothing. Another room has an extra 
layer of wood along the lower wall, but 
even this has been partially stripped 
away. While such destructive behavior 
is not an everyday occurrence, the 
employees must prepare for it. The 
adolescents at Nakash are particularly
