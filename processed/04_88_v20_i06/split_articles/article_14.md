EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The hormonal changes of puberty do not bypass these teenagers. The residents all have specific, long-term goals, based on their abilities, which are laid out each year at a meeting among the teachers, social workers, and parents. The child is helped along by positive reinforcement- a piece of candy or a smile- which rewards appropriate behavior.

Notebooks contain each person's daily activities, broken down into minute steps and indicating whether a step requires a teacher's prompting. The notebook for one boy contains "taking a shower" and "making my bed," as well as activities called "chocolate chip cookies" and "hobo's dinner." These two consist of a series of photographs that the children follow like recipes. The first shows an apron; the second hands being washed; the third a bowl, and then the necessary ingredients and utensils one by one.


Since most of the farm's residents are nonverbal, they often communicate through pictures. One child, doing a puzzle with his visiting father, makes use of a "conversation board," which has pasted to it his photo, words like "want" and "more," and a number of different foods and activities to which he can point. Sign language is also used, even with the few residents who do speak. One behavior associated with autism is echolalia, where the autistic child will repeat what is said to him or her. A few others, especially the higher-functioning residents, can respond to questions quite normally. But an autistic person rarely takes the initiative and actually speaks without being prompted. Simonson explains, however, that this seemingly apathetic behavior may be misleading. "They do form relationships, but in a different way," she says. "They attempt social interaction. Their inappropriate behaviors may be ways to initiate this." These work in getting people's attention. Many of the children periodically make a loud noise or gesture wildly.


These behaviors can, unfortunately, escalate into real violence, which is difficult to control when dealing with a grown person. All too frequently, this violence is self-directed. In one particularly severe case, a boy would throw himself face down on the ground, without even the reflex to put his hands up for protection. Benhaven needs to employ restraints, such as tying a tantruming individual to a chair or to a staff member. The State Board of Mental Retardation offers specific guidelines about which restraints are allowed. New methods must be approved, and all procedures recorded each time they are used. Representatives from the board pay frequent visits to Benhaven to check on how individuals are being treated.


The issue of restraint is delicate, as Benhaven recently learned all too well. Last fall, one mother sued the institution, charging that they were abusing her child. This woman had in fact bought for Benhaven the very straitjacket being used on her child. But it is not uncommon for parents to have difficulty accepting the use of restraints, though they are for the child's own protection.


Those concerned about the possibility of abuses raise the question whether it proves unwise for autistic children to be hidden away at isolated locations like the farm. Robert Burt, chairman of Benhaven's board of directors since 1985, has serious misgivings about this kind of separation, which makes it harder to monitor treatment. "These children can call forth a very primitive kind of fear in their caretakers," he says. "It's very easy to get locked into a very vicious cycle in which the kids are regarded by the adults as subhuman, and so inhuman things are done to them."


Burt also feels that abuses are hard to monitor in large institutions. He points out that Mansfield, one of Connecticut's state homes for the mentally retarded, grew to house 5,000 people until a lawsuit ordered it to decrease in size. "Mansfield is a terrible place," Burt says, "but it started as a family-run school in about 1890 for ten kids who lived with a superintendent, in a beautiful bucolic setting. So that's my constant refrain when we talk about enlarging. I always say, remember Mansfield." Unfortunately, Benhaven is under pressure from the state to expand. In Burt's view, Benhaven's small size and contact with the outside world have helped keep it from becoming "a warehouse operation."


Like the farm, the Benhaven school in Wallingford is set apart; its students are not integrated within the normal school system. "People rationalize it by saying they're happier amongst their own kind, and it's cruel to subject them to the stress of comparing themselves to normal kids," Burt says. "But I think that stress and comparison is a normal part of development and growth. The impulse to protect these kids because they're 'different' can mask a lot of negative feelings." Still, he speaks highly of Benhaven's program, cautioning only that it should not be considered a national model.


Inger Connery, a supervisor at Benhaven, points out that the Wallingford school may in fact be typical. "Sometimes states say 'yes, everybody's integrated in our state,'" she says, "and then you go and look and they're actually in separate classrooms." Admittedly, teachers unfamiliar with autism often have trouble dealing with the special needs of autistic students. Most of the Benhaven staff think that integration is appropriate only for the highest-functioning children. "Their behavior will be less disruptive, upsetting, and confusing to the normal kids," explains Dr. Joel Bregman of the Child Study Center.


Despite its continued emphasis on separate schooling, Benhaven is turning toward a policy of integrating with the community. "Everything is being examined right now," says Benhaven Teacher Tom Sobocinski. "We're talking in groups and committees about what is our mission, what is our philosophy, and that breaks down into our techniques and directions." Benhaven's new direction has led to the integrative programs at Medalie House and the Charles H. Drazen adult workshop.


Six of Benhaven's highest-functioning residents, ages 17-20, live at Medalie House in New Haven. The ornate building, which once housed a girls' finishing school, was first used by Benhaven as a school, but later was transformed into a residence. This decision provoked some hostility. "There was a movement within the neighborhood to raise money to buy the building from us," Burt recalls. "Before we met with the community, it was possible for some people to say, 'Well, I'm not opposed to retarded people in principle, but there are practical problems.' They'd cite things like parking, and noise. But then when we were so flexible on the practical problems, all that was left was . . ." He smiles wryly and does not continue.
