To Thailand, and Back

"What are you doing here?" 

I had taken my chances, I admit. 
Walking through the Yale campus by 
the Boola Boola Shop with the suspect 
credential of Recent Graduate, the 
question was bound to occur from the 
curious, the well-meaning, and the 
Oh-Hi-How-R-U (Keep walking, I 
don't really want to know) types alike. 
The question itself was perfectly 
innocent. But the tone implied something further: embarrassed surprise, as 
if I had stumbled into a black tie affair 
ready for a costume party; exasperated 
pity, as if I had stayed at this party well 
into its bitter end; condescending 
indifference, as if I were a street person 
asking for 
handouts of nostalgia. 

Disbelief: Why didn't I grab my 
chance to escape, finally, from this 
prison? 

I mumbled some answer with suitably Yale self-assurance. I looked at 
the trees, at the sidewalk, at my watch, 
all the while smiling, nodding, and 
hearing myself respond with such 
phrases 
as 
"learning experience," 
"challenging," "satisfying"-and 
the 
clincher, "I should be out of here by 
May or August." I had gnawed these 
words to the bone long ago; now they 
were stuck in my throat. After six 
months of repetition, how could I possibly draw any more sustenance from 
dry words 
like "challenging" and 
"satisfying"? 

I felt slightly dizzy. "And, uh, what 
are you up to?" I asked, breathing in 
deeply. 
My acquaintance's 
mouth 
opened into a dark chasm and dis-
gorged references to a familiar, far-
away life, one that I, too, had lived. 
"I'm in a play . . . spring break . . . 
senior essay .... " And then what? 
"Maybe law school .... " Blah blah 
blah. Hadn't I considered law school 
myself? A few months ago, desperate 
and aimless, hadn't I even taken that 
test, along with thousands of others in 
what was a record year for the LSAT 
administration? Wasn't I still considering applying to law school? I 
broke out in a sweat of delirious self-
examination: 
What should 
a typically ambitious Yalie, be doing? Once 
again, I felt uneasy about working in 
New Haven. 

My ego told me that I had defied the 
destiny that had brought me to Yale- I 
had left the path of the Wunderkinder. 
In sixth grade, the school nurse called 
me into her office, made me draw pictures of myself, and then informed me 
that I was gifted. I left her office 
wondering where I'd caught this disease. That is when I entered the 
cloistered company of boys and girls 
who went to Math and Science Club 
and did arts and crafts after school (I 
had to miss two episodes of "Speed 
Racer" per week). Then there was 
tracking in public schools where, no 
matter how many new kids you saw in 
the halls, you saw the same 30 faces in 
all of your classes. SAT scores danced 
before my eyes, as did teacher recommendations, and then college reply 
letters telling me that I was diverse, 
talented, and accepted. Proud parents, 
diplomas, awards, blah blah blah. 

I had made a speech to my high 


school class at graduation where I 
proselytized: Don't succumb to what 
others expect of you; destiny is not 
something to be comfortably accepted 
but must continually be remade. And 
after my speech, I saw the uncompromising face of my physics professor, Mr. P, telling me, "I hope you 
don't forget what you said." At the 
time, I was grinning too much, filled 
with the promise of the future, unable 
to think about what he meant. 

"So, uh, is it uh . . . strange ... 
living in New Haven?" 

I blinked. Mr. P was not watching 
me; I was in front of the Boola Boola 
Shop. "Strange?" I 
repeated. My 
acquaintance 
looked around 
nervously. She clearly thought I was 
strange. "Well, yeah, being so close to 
Yale and all," I said. 

I knew this sense of strangeness 
could come upon me anywhere, disguised as nostalgia or melancholy. But 
being in New Haven increased my 
awareness of the protection the Blue 
Mother affords its young. Standing in 
front of the Boola Boola shop, I looked 
into the window and remembered that 
for a moment, sometime in my junior 
year, the paraphernalia appealed to me. 
I would have blissfully wrapped myself 
up in Yale sweats, scarves, and even 
Boola Boola underwear. Between the 
shyness of freshman year and the 
camaraderie of graduation, we immerse 
ourselves in a stimulating and structured environment. 

Such 
a 
self-
contained and formative experience 
can give us the illusion that we are 
finished creatures, done with learning, 
and ready to accept our destiny, comfortably. A year later, I'm having 
doubts. 

"What's strange is that the Boola 
Boola underwear was so gosh darn 
snug," I mumbled. Confused, my 
acquaintance stared at me for several 
seconds, looked at her watch, and 
suddenly remembered she was late for 
something, but it had been nice talking 
to me. "Take care-" I called after her. 
I continued to stare at my reflection in 
the window. 

What was I doing here? Living, certainly. "Dude, you call that living?" my 
reflection answered. Wearing reflector 
glasses, cut off shorts, tie-dye shirt, 
and a big grin, he said, "Oughta be in 
Thailand. Kickin' back on the steps of 
a temple-some radical Frisbee turf out 
here." That's just an escape, I thought. 
I looked more closely, and decided I 
would look good in a suit and tie. "Wall 
Street's for me, buddy," he said, 
pulling at the wristband of his Rolex. 
"They started me at 35 grand, but I 
could be pulling in 60 with my bonus." 

And look like everybody else? Perhaps 
the academic robe was for me, dressing 
me for a life of the mind in some 
British university. "If you must walk 
off the path to cross the green, for 
heaven's sake don't let the Dons catch 
you." 

Engrossed by my reflected image, I 
was tempted by these roles, so easily 
adopted. But Mr. P's face appeared 
once again before my eyes. He reminded me that no matter where I am 
or what I do, it is the fate of adulthood 
to reevaluate one's standards and 
goals, to rediscover what is satisfying. 
After four years of weaning, of learning how to fit in and create an identity 
for oneself in a community, the Yale 
graduate -like any other graduate-
must learn all over again. In the end, 
one must wear one's own underwear.
