Along with the air station came the 
services of its experienced instructor 
and mechanic, Dave McCulloch, who 
had flown earlier in the war with the 
Royal Air Force of Italy. "McCulloch 
was a very fine man, but he sure liked 
to sleep as long as he could," Farwell 
says, giggling. "One time I got up early 
to go flying, drove out to the air sta-
tion, and he was still eating his 
breakfast, so he took his meal with him 
into the plane. He had his coffee in a 
seltzer bottle or something. I was 
flying the plane, and as I took off, his 
coffee and milk just sprayed all over his 
face and shoulders. He was a very 
bright man, and I'll tell you, he surely 
never made that same mistake twice." 

In addition to teaching his students 
how to pilot the flying-boats, McCul-
loch took care to acquaint the unit with 
the technical intricacies of the aircraft. 
Since there were only two-mechanics at 
Port Washington, the students had to 
learn how to overhaul engines and do 
repair work if they wanted to fly. The 
mechanical skills they acquired would 
later prove invaluable to the Navy. 

During the fall term of 1916, the 
Navy invited the Yale unit to move its 
flying-boats to the submarine base at 
New London. The students continued 
to practice flying as much as their 
studies would allow, and one Sunday, 
Davison and Farwell caused quite a 
stir on campus when they dropped in 
by hydroplane in time for chapel. 

When the United States severed 
diplomatic relations with Germany in 
February, the First Yale Unit more 
than doubled its roster to a total of 29 
men. Congress had finally passed the 
Naval Appropriations Bill, and in 
March, the unit became the first 
detachment of the United States Naval 
Reserve Flying Corps. Davison and 
seven others became commissioned 
officers. With resources for aviation 
still scarce, the Navy could provide the 
unit with no more than a commanding 
officer, a few mechanics, and some 
machine guns. The rest of the 
operation, air station included, 
"Flying will be as much 
a part of an American 
gentleman's 
accomplishments as 
golf or automobiling." 
continued to be financed privately. 
J . P. Morgan & Co. contributed 
$100,000 to the cause, and in a matter 
of days the unit had raised an 
additional $146,000 through private 
donations. According to Paine, the 
funds amassed were "enough to startle 
the Navy Department which, until 
1916, had been unable to obtain from 
Congress any separate appropriations 
for aviation whatever, and then only to 
the amount of $1,000,000." Although 
the unit used most of its enormous 
budget to purchase more aircraft and 
equipment, military life had its little 
luxuries. During its training period, 
the unit paid $1,549 for "laundry & 
valet expenses." 

The unit left Yale mid-semester in 
1917, training in West Palm Beach for 
the winter months, and then relocating 
in Huntington, Long Island. By the 
end of July, all of the unit had had 
sufficient flying time to take the naval 
qualifying test for aviators. The first 
portion of the test required each pilot 
to land his aircraft within 300 feet of a

buoy. "First we had to fly up to about 
5,000 feet," Farwell explains. "Now 
that's not very high, is it? But back then 
it took an hour and a half." Farwell was 
one of the unit's 26 aviators who 
qualific:d to receive a Navy pilot's 
license. 

"When 
I 
took 
off," he 
continues, "the first thing I noticed was 
that there was gasoline on my seat, and 
I can tell you, that stuff sure bums. 
When I came in to land, I pointed 
right at the boat where all the Navy 
men were standing. I guess from their 
point of view it looked like I was going 
to land right on top of them, and they 
were all yelling and getting ready to 
jump in the water. I was probably a 
good 75 feet off, but the F-boat's wing 
was about 50 feet long, so I guess that's 
close enough." 

During this same landing test, Tru-
bee Davison, suffering from fainting 
spells, made a 
slight error while 
maneuvering and plunged his machine 
headlong into the water. His flying-
boat split in two under the impact. 
As Farwell explains, "The engine in the 
F-boat was behind you. When Trubee 
crashed, the engine came over him. It 
didn't kill him, but it crippled him." 
Davison broke his back in the accident, 
becoming a paraplegic for life. 

Beginning in August, the Navy split 
up the First Yale Unit, sending its men 
to a variety of posts both overseas and 
in the United States. In the intro-
duction to Paine's book, Navy Rear 
Admiral William Sims notes that with 
qualified aviators at a premium, the 
Navy used 
the comprehensively 
trained men of the unit as "a nucleus 
for the training of an air force at 
home." Having left Yale only six 
months before, the members of the 
unit took up positions as instructors 
and commanders of air stations. 
F.arwell was sent to Buffalo, where 
he was responsible for training an 
additional 12 
Yale students, the 
Second Yale Unit. In November, the 
Navy reassigned Farwell to Pensacola 
as an instructor, along with six 
members of the Second Yale Unit who 
had qualified as aviators under his 
guidance. "The man in charge at 
Pensacola could get the plane off the

ground and land it, but in general, 
naval officers just didn't know 
anything about the machines them-
selves," Farwell says. "We did all the 
legwork. When we got there, they had 
96 planes, but only 16 could fly. When 
we left, they still had 96 planes, but 
only 16 couldn't fly." The situation was 
similar at other air stations all over the 
United States. "Wherever the boys 
from the First Yale Unit went," Farwell 
adds, "they might have had a naval 
officer over them, but they knew more 
than the naval officer knew-there was 
no comparison." 

The First Yale Unit performed pro-
digiously in the war. All but six of its 
men saw active duty in Europe; three 
were killed in action. Five won the 
Navy Cross for conspicuous gallantry, 
and three received the Distinguished 
Service Medal. Two were awarded the 
British Flying Cross, ten the French 
Croix de Guerre, four the Belgian Croix de 
Guerre. One, David Ingalls, who had 
left Yale after his freshman year, 
became the Navy's only "air ace," 
shooting down at least five enemy 
aircraft. 

Some of the unit used their war 
experience 
as 
a 
springboard 
to 
positions of greater responsibility in 
government service. Ingalls and one 
other member of the unit later became 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy for 
Air. Two more of the unit, one of them 
Davison, held the post of Assistant 
Secretary of War for Air. And perhaps 
the most successful member of the 
unit, Robert Lovett, became George 
C . Marshall's Undersecretary of State 
during the implementation of the 
Marshall Plan and succeeded Marshall 
as Secretary of Defense.

In the fall of 1919, a year after the 
signing of the armistice, war veterans 
flooded the Yale campus. Of these, 
about 50 had flown in the Army, 
Navy, or Marine Corps branches of 
aviation. In January, these veteran 
pilots formed the Yale Aeronautical 
Society and elected to its executive 
board two former members of the First 
Yale Unit, Ingalls and Harry Davison 
Jr. , Trubee's younger brother. The 
society wasted no time in entering the

first Intercollegiate Flying Meet ever. 
Before a crowd of more than fifteen 
hundred, Yale won t~e 25-mile air 
race, the main event of the contest, 
edging out the University of Penn-
sylvania by a mere ten s~onds. One of 
the pilots in the victorious airplane was 
Juan T. Trippe ('20), Secretary of both 
the Yale Aeronautical Society and the 
Intercollegiate Flying Association. 

After leaving Yale, Trippe combined 
his administrative and aeronautical 
expertise to found Pan American 
Airways. 

When the representatives of the Yale 
flying club returned to campus with 
their first-place trophy, the University 
refused to place their cup among those 
collected by the other athletic teams. 
Popular wisdom at the time suggested 
that recreational flying was aristocratic 
suicide. Without university support, 
the club soon died out. 

In 1927, the year that Charles 
Lindbergh made his famous Atlantic 
crossing, interest in aviation grew 
markedly on the Yale campus, in-
spiring students to organize the Yale 
Aeronautical Society. Remembering 
the previous dub's conflict with the 
administration, the new society chose 
to focus on the innocuous pastimes of 
research and education. This flying 
club, strictly speaking, was not a flying 
club. 

The Yale Aeronautical Society's 
emphasis on research made an impact 
on aviation outside of the University. 
When the municipal body responsible 
for 
investigating possible 
New 
Haven airport sites postponed 
action 
two 
years, 
the 
society took the mttlative and 
recommended an appropriate location. 
The group conducted an extensive 
survey of land around New Haven and 
meticulously compared the conditions 
and costs of the 17 most important 
landing fields in the United States. 
Although the New Haven Air Board 
rejected the particular site that the 
society recommended, the aviation 
club stimulated interest in the 
construction of an airport in New 
Haven. 

The most recognized effort of the 
Yale Aeronautical Society came in 
October 1928, when delegates from all 
over the country flocked to New 
Haven for the first Intercollegiate 
Aviation Conference. The convention, 
which lasted three days, included 
presentations from a U.S. Senator, the 
Aeronautics, and world-famous avia-
trix Amelia Earhart. 
F. 
Trubee 
Davison, Assistant Secretary of War, 
sent a telegram of congratulations. 
The conference helped legitimize 
college clubs throughout the country.
