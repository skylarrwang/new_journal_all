On Pride in Prejudice 
When Allan Bloom, in his book. The 
Closing of the American Mind, writes, 
"These kids just do not have prejudices 
against anyone," he is not praising 
students for their tolerance and under-
standing. On the contrary, Bloom 
maintains that prejudice is healthy 
because it serves as a testing ground 
for philosophical and spiritual ideas. If 
students have no prejudices, all think-
ing is done in a vacuum; students are 
drained of the passion to believe in 
anything strongly. 
Drawing dis-
tinctions, according to Bloom, has

become taboo: We are no longer 
WASPs, blacks, men, or women-we 
are merely individuals. We are 
uninspired by music, our studies, or 
members of the opposite sex. In its 
effort to make everyone equal, demo-
cracy has made everyone more or less 
the same, without prejudice or pas-
SIOn. 

The structure of higher education 
has changed through democratic pro-
grams such as affirmative action and 
coeducation, pitting our prejudices 
against our experience. Bloom labor-

iously documents this change, and 
draws conclusions based on what he 
sees. 
The 
institutions 
in 
which 
he has taught over the course of 
several decades have given him an 
excellent testing ground for his 
theories. But after all the social 
upheavals of counterculture, the civil 
rights movement, the feminist move-
ment, and the sexual revolution, the 
fundamental human nature of the stu-
dent has not changed -as much as 
Bloom fears. Prejudice, with all its 
advantages and disadvantages, still 


exists. Human nature does not alter 
over a matter of decades, no matter 
how monumental the collapse of the 
existing structure. The passion for 
people and learning is still there. 

The breakdown, as Bloom sees it, is 
epitomized by the rise of rock music 
and the fall of classical music. He does 
not equate rock with the pelvis thrust-
ing of Elvis Presley or with the 
seductive wardrobe of Madonna-that 
would be too simplistic. Instead he 
states, "This strong stimulant, which 
Nietzsche called Nihiline, was for a 
very long time, almost fifteen years, 
epitomized in a single figure, Mick 
.Jagger." He· informs us that "rock 
music has one appeal, a barbaric 
appeal, to sexual desire." No one will 
try to refute his claim by comparing 
the Stones to Stravinsky, but one can 
draw a parallel between the passionate 
effects of the composers on the listener. 
Looking more realistically at this 
music which "closes our minds to the 
higher pursuits of life," ··we must do 
what Bloom neglects to do: look at the 
various roots and branches of the huge 
tree of which Mick Jagger and his bar-
baric appeal are only a part. Rock 
stems from centuries of blues and jazz. 
Far from being a purely homogenous 
tradition, rock music contains diverse 
strains. Take any four roommates, and 
even if every one is a rock fan, each 
will have distinct tastes within that 
genre. While Bloom may consider rock 
nihilistic, I have prejudices against my 
roomates' music while 
remaining 
passionately inspired by my own. 
Not only does Bloom overlook these 
various branches of rock, and their 
accompanying prejudices, 
he pro-
daim<; 
that "rock 
music provides 
premature ecstasy 
artificially 
induces exaltation naturally attached 
to the completion of the greatest 
endeavors." Bloom paints an exag-
gerated picture of students as sexually-
frenzied rats following the Pied Piper 
Mick Jagger. He is reduced to the 
character of the evangelists, 
condemning "on-campus forrniii-
cation!" For our salvation, the 
evangelists offer the Good Book; 
Bloom offers the Great Books. 

While Bloom sees rock music as a 
dangerous disruption of a valuable 
system of prejudices, he feels that the 
civil rights movement, ironically, has 
done the opposite. Through affirm-
ative action, the movement has simply 
replaced one bad system with another. 
Bloom writes, "The programmatic 
brotherhood of the sixties did not 
culminate in integration but veered off 
toward black separation." He points to 
the segregated tables in the dining halls 
as evidence of this phenomenon. 

But the tables in dining halls "where 
no white student would comfortably sit 
down" are only part of the story. Some 
people would not comfortably sit down 
at an all Dramat table or Yalesbians 
table anymore than others would sit 
down at an all crew-jock table. These 
are more subtle prejudices that Bloom . 
ignores. It was not any different in 
Bloom's college days. 

Bloom states, "Whatever their poli-
tics, they [students] believe that all 
men- and women- are created equal 
and have equal rights. Whenever they
