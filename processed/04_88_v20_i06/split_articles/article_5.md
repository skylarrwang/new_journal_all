EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
last January, I had already completed 
three terms of college. Entering Yale as 
a second-semester sophomore, I could 
not turn back. I stood in front of those 
closed gates having already shut the 
door on my previous school. 

I left the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) in Cambridge at 
the end of last year in order to escape 
the stress and a frighteningly narrow 
education. MIT's presentation in my 
hometown of Wichita, Kansas had 
assured me that the school offered the 
best of both worlds- the most skilled 
scientific minds and first-rate facilitie: 
coupled with a strong humanities de-
partment and a well-rounded student 
body. This balanced approach ap-
pealed to me. Although I wanted to 
study physics and engineer.ing, I also 
sought an environment that fostered 
creativity and an ample exchange of 
ideas. But it took less than a)nonth for 
MIT to shatter this carefully crafted 
illusion, 
the naive notion that a 
technical school can provide a com-
plete education. 

MIT trains its students to be tal-
ented physicists, computer scientists, 
or engineers. It doesn't teach them how 
to think, feel, or interact with people. 
At MIT it is fashionable to wear 
t-shirts emblazoned with "IHTFP" (I 
Hate This Fucking Place). It has one of 
the highest suicide rates in the coun-
try-six people killed themselves my 
year. Most students stay up all night 
twice a week, every week, to get prob-
lem sets done. Of the 13 men in my 
fraternity pledge class, three have left 
MIT. Of the ten that remain, two have 
developed drinking problems, and at 
least one sees a psychiatrist regularly. 
When I decided to transfer out, many 
of my fraternity brothers told me they 
wished they had done the same. For 
them, being only a year or two away 
from the coveted "brass rat" (the MIT 
class ring with the beaver mascot), 
they had already endured too much to 
turn back. But with only one year 
invested, and three more ahead, I had 
to leave. Yale offered the education 
and challenge that I wanted. Since my 
arrival, 
I have enjoyed just how 
relaxed it is here. 

That year, however, did not go to 
waste. Unlike the freshmen arriving at 
Phelps Gate in the fall, transfers come 
to Yale with a focus that only comes 
from trying something and failing-or 
having it fail you. Because transfers 
have already attended college some-
where else, they know what to embrace 
and what to avoid, both in academics 
and extra-curriculars. A lot of them 
are older, having taken time off from 
school to work, travel, or serve in the 
military. Their experience in making 
transitions facilitates their adjustment. 
When I arrived at Yale, I had al-
ready lived through that nervous first 
week away from home, the excitement 
of meeting classmates, the flurry of 
activity before classes begin. No longer 
was college a strange new environment 
where I suddenly had an accent, pop 
was soda, and beer was sold at package 
stores. 

At my new school, I would share the
