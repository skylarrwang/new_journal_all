on a piece of white paper near the top 
of the gate. "Need room keys?" the sign 
asked. It was the first instruction for 
moving in that I had seen. I called the 
number. No one was there.

Yale, the student who had given me a 
ride from the train station. He shook 
my hand and smiled sympathetically.

My troubled arrival was hardly the 
triumphant entrance into Yale I had

throng of other incoming students, no 
counselor to answer questions or to 
help me settle in. If I had been a
