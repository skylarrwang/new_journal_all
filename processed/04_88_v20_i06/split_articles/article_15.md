must come from Medicaid, mainly 
available through the recipient's home 
state. About half of the residents at 
Medalie come from other states, and 
may have to return home or enter 
another institution. Benhaven's adult 
residence is small although other group 
homes do exist in Connecticut. As Burt 
says, "Our theory is not that we have a 
lifetime commitment to these people, 
but that we take very behaviorally dis-
turbed kids and try to teach them to 
live in a group setting." 

The Charles H. Drazen adult work-
shop hopes to integrate autistic people 
into society by placing them in regular 
paying jobs. Located in a 
neigh-
borhood of factories, Drazen is a small 
structure 
squeezed 
in between 
a 
banana company and a sausage com-
pany. When workers are unemployed, 
they spend their time performing tasks 
in the workshop itself. "Usually it's 
copies of jobs that we know we'll be 
getting or that we have had in the 
past," 
explains Supervisor 
Inger 
Connery. "They use real materials. 
Sometimes we ask a customer if he'll 
leave us a few extra boxes of things." 
As is typical at Benhaven, the work-
shop is understaffed. At the work-
tables, if a staff member turns away, 
the people gradually stop working, and 
begin to stare or to engage in ritualized 
motions. Still, as Connery points out, 
"Just staying at a table for an hour is a 
taught behavior. All these things have 
been worked on since they were very 
young, because part of autism is being 
very distractable, being always in tune 
to what you need and your own inter-
nal sensations." At an unattended 
table, one woman with glasses and a 
blond ponytail rocks back and forth, 
while the man beside her erupts in a 
sudden flurry of hand gestures that 
looks like a drum solo. They are making 
surgical bags; this involves folding a 
white plastic sheet into a rectangle, 
with the aid of a wooden board or 
ruler, and securing it with a tie. The 
staff, mostly college graduates, moves 
back and forth, starting people up 
again by saying their name or simply 
pointing to the pile of plastic sheets. "A 
lot of people here can do the job," 
Connery says. "The problem is moti-
vation. They're very dependent on 
prompting." 

When an autistic adult does take a 
job outside, he or she is always 
accompanied by a 
teacher. 
This 
program is called "supported employ-
ment." Supervisor Tom Sobocinski 
explains that ideally, jobs are suited to 
a worker's strengths. Some, for ex-
ample, have an unusually high tol-
erance for loud noise. They will also 
have no desire to socialize at work, and 
this creates a picture of efficiency. "I 
preach mutual dependability," Sobo-
cinski says. "We are unique in the 
state, and I think in a lot of other parts 
of the country as well, in that we put 
our people on the payroll. They be-
come employees of the company and so 
there are nice things like at T hanks-
giving, they brought turkeys home." 
Walking around the main room of 
the workshop, Sobocinski points to a 
bulletin board covered with all the 
different buttons the workers have 
made, from "Friend of the New Haven 
Library" to "I love Midori melonballs." 
The workshop owns six button-making 
machines. Other jobs have included 
delivering phone books and assembly 
line work. 

But the training at Drazen goes 
beyond work skills. Many of the group 
homes incorporate the teaching of 
skills and responsibility into daily life, 
through household tasks like folding 
laundry or preparing meals. Drazen 
provides other opportunities for com-
munity interaction through eating out, 
going shopping, or taking small trips 
during free time. One worker goes out 
for breakfast regularly with a super-
visor. "That starts the day off with a 
real positive interaction," Sobocinski 
says. 

Following Drazen's example, the 
residences are also emphasizing work 
skills. "The trend now is to start in 
nursery school and kindergarten," 
Connery says. "Things like taking 
responsibility, independence, having a 
job. It's not such a new idea for regular 
kids, because in kindergarten, you 
have things like you are in charge of 
watering the plants, you are feeding 
the rabbit. But for a disabled popu-
lation this wasn't always necessarily the 
case." 

The adolescents at the farm also 
learn how to function in the outside 
world. As Connery explains, seem-
ingly simple things like eating out can 
be broken down into a "large number of 
separate steps." Each thing might have 
to be taught in a very systematic way. 
So you do need to start early," she says. 
Meanwhile, the Wallingford school 
emphasizes academic skills like math 
in useful contexts such as counting 
money or telling time. These are 
taught alongside less school-oriented 
activities like toothbrushing. 

Benhaven hopes that through such 
instruction, its graduates will have 
experienced life within the community 
from an early age, and will be stronger 
candidates for programs like Drazen. 
The staff does acknowledge, though, 
that some cases are beyond such help. 
When school funding ends at the age of 
21, the residents with the least po-
tential may be placed in state insti-
tutions, considered by many a last 
resort. Benhaven is expensive, and its 
programs can only do so much. But for 
some, it can mean the difference be-
tween an overcrowded institution and 
a job in the community.
