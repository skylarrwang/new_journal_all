EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"revolution marched under the banner 
of freedom, feminism under that of 
equality." Their problem arose when 
the two clashed over issues such as 
pornography, he states accurately. In a 
later paragraph, he points to another 
contradiction: "The sexual revolution, 
however, wanted men and women to 
get together bodily, while feminism 
wanted them to be able easily to get 
along separately." These contradictions are still unfolding, and we 
have yet to see where they will leave 
us. Such movements can be summed 
up as the antitheses to what had been 
the theses of previous decades. Yet 
Bloom wants to deny that there is or 
will be a synthesis of these two stages. 
Bloom gives an exhaustive presentation of the changes in American as 
well as in European thought. Every 
paragraph of his book is fascinating 
and provocative. But because he fails 
to understand us on more than a 
superficial level, he fails to see our 
passions and our prejudices, our 
heroes and our villains. He does not 
eat breakfast, brush his teeth, or wait 
to use the shower with us. He has a 
limited knowledge of what we feel, and 
therefore, of what we lack. 

Bloom presents the reader with a 
well-defined figure of a student- nice, 
as he puts it, but basically uninspired. 
By all detached reasoning, Bloom 
should be believed, but he is no longer 
a student. In his impatience to prescribe a remedy for our ills, Bloom 
invents the disease. His overall claim is 
that higher education must get back to 
basics before we can become healthy 
again. It is ironic that he has forgotten 
the most basic lesson of education-you can't judge a book by its 
cover.
