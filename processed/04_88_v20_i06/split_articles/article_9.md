only 50 to 100 feet. "There were a 
couple of angry letters to the editor," 
laughs Hank Galpin (DC '67), YA's 
second president and a self-avowed fan 
of Hanson's. "His response was that 
Yale ought to see a great fighter plane 
flown by a great World War Two 
fighter pilot- and that was him." 
Hanson had won the Distinguished 
Flying Cross for completing 54 carrier-
based missions near Japan. He also 
conducted a one-plane, one-professor 
aerobatics show in his spare time in 
order to finance his monstrous aircraft. 
Due to, or perhaps despite the at-
tention which Hanson drew to the 
club, YA grew from one aircraft to 
three, and from 22 active members to 
60 in the course of three years. Since 
one of YA's charter members was an 
insider at Woodbridge Hall, support 
from the University was not long in 
coming. "President Brewster was a 
World War Two pilot himself," Galpin 
remembers. "So I'm sure he smiled 
favorably on the whole d~al." Today's 
incarnation of that same dub, which 
enjoys the full recognition of the 
administration, combines the eclectic 
pursuits of its predecessors with the 
more extensive resources now available. 
In addition to sponsoring speakers and 
offering discount 
flight 
rates, 
the 
organization promotes inexpensive 
overseas tours. 

In the 54 years separating the 
founding of the earliest and most re-
cent Yale aviation clubs, the science of 
aeronautics made extraordinary ad-
vances, but the basic allure of flying 
remained the same. Hanson's powerful 
Grumman Bearcat could climb to an 
altitude of 10,000 feet in just 81 
seconds, while Farwell's rickety Curtiss 
flying-boat would have taken three 
hours to cover the same distance. But 
for both men, as for David Ingalls, 
participation in a Yale flying club has 
always meant the opportunity for pilots 
to meet with others who can under-
stand the relaxing exhilaration of that 
constant, calm engine noise .
