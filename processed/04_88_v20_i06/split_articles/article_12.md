jor. Reading a book requires aligning 
yourself with a point of view; when this 
point of view always places your own 
group in 
a 
submissive 
position, 
reading becomes masochistic. Looking 
on while your gender or ethnic group is 
continually maligned makes sociologtcal 
analysis, just as much as stoic silence, 
painful. 

Many suggest that marginal groups 
look into 
special 
programs like 
Women's 
Studies, 
Afro-American 
Studies, or Gay Studies, a program 
Hexter has helped set up. Such pro-
grams have great value because they 
focus on peripheral voices, but their 
existence should not obscure the issues 
that the canon needs to examine. An 
Afro-American Studies department 
does not relieve the English depart-
ment from considering questions of 
race. Further, the notion that certain 
parts of humankind need to enroll in 
their own specialized programs denies 
the possibility of a tradition which 
embodies a common human heri-
tage-once a fundamental assumption 
of the humanities. 

Perhaps this 
possibility died long ago, but a means 
for dialogue between these groups 
remains essential. As Hexter observes, 
"Our only safety is in the play between 
the different perspectives. Whatever 
truth there is will be found slipping 
between the planes." 

Study of the humanities should in-
clude such dialogue. Critical reading 
of the canon is not a reverent cele-
bration of the books that make human-
ity great- it is a dynamic and often 
personal confrontation. Seybold 
believes this challenge motivates many 
Humanities majors. She noted that 
only a small percentage of the major is 
mad<· up nf ''hilt·. Chri,tian malt•, 
-the group toward which the canon 
has traditionally aimed. "I think maybe 
if the question of the canon doesn't 
bother you, you study something else. 
I feel like Pve got to deal with it. We're 
not all canon-lovers, but you've got to 
study something to know how to 
change it."
