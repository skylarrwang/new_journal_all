Third generation David Ingalls (PC '88): "It's not like driving a car."
One of the last society presidents, 
Charles Morris ('32), left Yale after his 
sophomore year to get married, but he 
took his dedication to aeronautics with 
him. Only two years out of Yale, in 
1931, he became Connecticut State 
Aviation Commissioner, a post he 
filled for ten years before joining the 
Sikorsky company as chief test pilot for 
early versions of the helicopter. "It was 
while I was flying for Mr. Sikorsky 
that we really broke through the 
barrier and discovered we had a flying 
machine," Morris recalls. "So you can 
see that the Yale Aeronautical Association really opened up some doors for 
me." Morris later wrote a book on the 
genesis of the helicopter.


Enthusiasm for aviation reemerged in 
1936, 
when 
sophomore 
Bill 
Slaymaker (SY '38) and a group of 
seven or eight friends decided one 
evening to try to organize an air meet. 
Slaymaker has kept an aviation scrapbook ever since those early days at 
Yale. His office, which takes up the 
portion of a bright red barn not 
occupied by his wife's race horse and 
two barn 
cats, 
overflows with 
memorabilia of a sportsman's life- a 
wild 
boar head, 
photographs of 
gargantuan fish, model biplanes. Red 
and yellow aircraft fly in all directions 
across the wallpaper in his bathroom. 
As one might expect, Slaymaker's 
aviation club emphasized the sporting 
aspect of aeronautics. Beginning in 
1937, the group flew in three annual 
intercollegiate 
meets, 
losing ignominiously to Harvard in the first two, 
but finally winning the trophy in 1939. 
Five colleges participated in the first 
contest, including Smith, whose sole 
representative gained the title "lone girl 
flyer" in a Yale Daily News headline. 
One event, called "paper strafing," 
required the pilots to throw a roll of 
toilet paper out of their cockpits and to 
cut it three times with their aircraft as 
the roll unfurled. "If you had a plane 
with an open cockpit, like my Fairchild, the best thing to do was throw it 
out at the top of a loop, so you could 
cut it for the first time on your way 
back," Slaymaker says, pronouncing 
his words with an unmistakable twang. 
"You could cut the darned thing with 
either your wing or your prop, but if 
you got it with the prop, it would really 
shred the toilet paper and not leave you 
much to cut the second time around." 
Although no one was ever seriously 


injured during Slaymaker's tenure, he 
and three friends did have a close call. 
"The day after the Hindenburg exploded, we flew out to see the wreck in 
Lakehurst, but we never got there," 
Slaymaker says. "We were flying over 
Long Island when the doggone prop 
fell off. Al Oiss, who was a darned 
good 
pilot, 
made an emergency 
landing in the infield of the Belmont 
Raceway." 
After the Japanese bombed Pearl 
Harbor in 1941, a handful of aviators 
from Slaymaker's club, most of them 
now graduates, enlisted individually in 
the Air Service. The club's best pilot, 
Fred Borsodi (TO '39), joined the 
Army Air Corps. "At first they made 
him a second lieutenant because he 
could fly, but when they found out 
what he could really do with an 
airplane, they made him a major," 
Slaymaker says. Borsodi completed 
130 
missions as a 
fighter 
primarily in the African and Italian 
theaters. In the last year of the war, 
Borsodi was killed flying an experimental plane in England. 
In addition 
to the 
individual 
wartime contributions of the Yale 
Aviation Club's pilots, the University 
itself allowed the Army Air Force 
Training Command School (AAFTC) 
to set up shop right on the Yale 
campus, prompting at least one Old 
Blue to complain that Yale had sold its 
soul to the military. Beginning in 
1943, the 3,000 cadets of AAFTC, the 
largest school for the training of 
technical officers in the Air Corps, 
took over one-half of the University's 
residential facilities and one-third of its 
classrooms. Living alongside Yale's 
2,700 undergraduates, a typical Army 
cadet roomed in an Old Campus 
dormitory, did calisthenics in the 
Payne Whitney Gymnasium, ate his 
meals in the Freshman Commons, and 
attended courses in aerial photography 
in the Hall of Graduate Studies. 
After World War Two, about 40 
undergraduates, both Air Corps war 
veterans and aviation novices, established Yale's sixth aeronautical club, 
Yale Aviation, Inc. The club took part 
in annual intercollegiate "fly-ins," 
competitions similar to those of the 
previous decade, but otherwise its 
commitments were quite informal. 
"After the war, people began to accept 
aviation as a reasonable way to get 
around," says Richard Mann (TD '49), 
co-founder of the club. "It was a lot of 
fun. You'd call up some babe from 
Smith and say: 'Hop in your plane, I'll 
meet you for lunch.'" The club continued to function until the late fifties, 
primarily as a sporting proposition.

The current campus flying club, 
Yale Aviation, appeared in 1964. Its 
founders have all had unusually eventful lives or deaths in aviation, 
reflecting the range of fortunes that 
have followed membership in Yale's 
aeronautical clubs. After leaving Yale, 
YA president Fred Smith (OE '66) went 
on to found Federal Express, an idea 
he had first proposed in an economics 
paper as an undergraduate. Howard 
Weaver (OE '45W), Yale President 
Kingman 
Brewster's 
assistant 
for 
external affairs and a World War Two 
bomber pilot, once walked away unharmed from the wreckage of an 
airplane whose fuel line had frozen 
over Massachusetts. Norwood Russell 
Hanson, 
a 
philosophy of science 
professor known for his ebullient 
personality, his passion for flying, and 
his unbridled arrogance, died in his 
aircraft in 1967, crashing into a 
mountain on his way to give a lecture 
at Cornell entitled "Flight Theory 
Within the History of Ideas." 
Throughout YA's early years, 
Hanson brought the club a good deal 
of free publicity, not all of it positive. 
During the 1965 football season, Hanson buzzed the Yale Bowl on four 
different occasions in his thunderous, 
five-ton Grumman Bearcat; clearing 
the heads of terrified football fans by
