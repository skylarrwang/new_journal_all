**Title: Exploding the Canon**

Samuel Coleridge had been dumped 
and wanted sympathy. "Oh, Lady." 
the poet moaned, "what can these avaiV 
to lift the smothering weight from my 
breast?" the class stared blankly at 
"Dejection: An Ode" on the Kinko's 
xerox. To his cries of"Lady" Coleridge 
received no answer. Frustrated by the 
silence, the professor leaned forward. 
"Don't you see, the poet takes a per-
sonal tragedy, and by putting it into 
traditional ode form, gives it uni-
versality." 

Coleridge's universality was aimed 
at a select few. For the women in this 
seminar, Coleridge's words did not 
inspire sympathy: Despite his cries of 
"Lady," the poem was obviously ad-
dressing men. The realization that 
accepted conceptions of the universal 
are in fact Â· exclusive has forced the 
academic community to reexamine the 
collection of Western writings known 
as the canon. The canon has tradi-
tionaUy been held to embody the 
deepest and most universal expres.sions 
of the human spirit. Today, incre.asing 
numbers of critics are exploring ways 
to redefme the canon, pointing out its 
biases. Though the canon has always 
been under revision, the current ex-
plosion of different voices may be the 
greatest conflict it has ever seen. 

The complex political and social 
questions that make up the debate 
affect students on an immediate level. 
These questions boil down to how we 
relate to what we read. What do we 
expect books to do for us, and how do 
we as students and professors insti-
tutionalize these expectations in the 
canon or, more concretely, a study of 
the humanities at Yale? 

Current focal points of the debate at 
Yale are the Directed Studies Program 
(OS) and the Humanities major. Both 
programs claim to provide grounding 
in the Western literary and philo-
sophical tradition. This year the 
42-year-old OS program faced a pro-
posal for revision, while the experi-
mental Humanities major received the 
stamp of tenure from the faculty in 
December. Within the Humanities 
major, dissent broke out last year in a 
seminar on Modernity. One work by a 
woman appeared on the syllabus- an 
eight-line poem by Emily Dickinson. 
"It was a kind of brewing hostility 
among us, especially on the part of the 
women," said Susan Epstein (SM '88). 
"We were frustrated with the limits ot 
the canon and its assumptions." 

After hearing students' concerns, the 
faculty of the Humanities major 
organized a symposium addressing the 
question of the outsider and the tra-
dition. Walter Cahn, professor of 
History of Art, spoke about teaching a 
course on cathedrals and being Jewish. 
Ralph Hexter, associate professor of 
Classics, talked about being gay and 
teaching the Medieval period, with its 
love poetry and church doctrine. And 
Patricia Joplin, assistant professor of 
English, spoke of the tensions of 
studying a masculine literary tradition. 
Joplin says it was "like 
a 
thundercloud" when she read Virginia 
Woolfs A Room of One's Own in a class 
at Hampshire College caUed "Looking 
Back Through Our Mothers" in 1972. 
"It became so obvious that in my own 
education I'd been asked to forget I 
was female. I read in a way that was 
male, and went along registering these 
shocks and insults that had not been 
addressed," she said. Joplin decided to 
make up for her patriarchical edu-
cation. She went out and found books 
by women. "I just bought them all, and 
began feeding myself, reading my way 
through them." 

Similar frustrations prompted a 
committee to study the problem of 
gender in the OS curriculum last year. 
Led by Assistant Professor of English 
Nancy Wright, the committee ob-
tained a $2,500 grant from the Ford 
Foundation. The resulting report 
found that, although OS has under-
gone structural changes since its 
establishment in 1946. "the cour-.es' 
syllabuses had remained fuced in their
