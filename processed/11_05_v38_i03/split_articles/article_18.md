operate on just such a principle 
con-
sider cathedrals, constructed to let in 
as much natural light as possible. The 
keynote speakers at the symposium 
will be Vincent Scully, the architectur-
al historian, and E. 0. Wilson~ the 
entomologist. This should not surprise 
you. 

Naturally, 
the 
Center

Bioethics would bring together a devo-
tee of Saint Denis Abbey and a man 
obsessed with ants.

**Title: For the Birds**

I WAS ILL-PREPARED FOR MY FIRST BIRD-
walk. After staying up till three the night 
before, I arrived at East Rock Park five 
hours later armed only with coffee and 
• 
a warm coat. The Birdwalk was one

Watching 
involved either birding, 
walking, or, in some cases, both. 

I expected, given the early hour, that I 
would find myself mosdy in the company 
of children. The Birdwalk seemed the per-
fect fieldtrip for Madeleine's girls · school 
class or a nanny with young ones in tow. 
But as I approached the Trowbridge 
Environmental Center, the only other 
walkers in sight were a young guy around 
my age 
with dreadlocks and skater pants, 
who seemed no more comfortable in the 
forest than I 
and an older, seemingly 
more bird-conscious man, who was 
equipped with binoculars, a huntstnan cap 
and sturdy hiking boots you could wear to 
kill a bear. 

The three of us <;onverged in front 
of the Trowbridge Center's front door 
and ventured inside together. There, we 
toured the Center's main room, which 
houses small exhibitions about wildlife 
with names ranging from the banal 
"Migratory Raptors" to the exclarnatory 
"Trees are Terrific." 

Tom Parlapiano, an employee of the 
Trowbridge Environmental Center, pro-
vided an un-outfitted companion and 
me with binoculars and led our gang 
November 2005 
of three outdoors. 

Parlapiano, a veteran 
birdwatcher, said the 
only trick of the 
trade is observation. 
Silhouette, flight 
patterns, habitat: 
each of these ele-
ments 
must 
be 
examined to deter-
mine a species. As 
we began our walk 
in the woods he 
appeared to dispense 
this wisdom to dis-
tract us from the fact 
that there were no 
actual birds in sight. 

It seemed that the 
two hour trip would 
be spent 
mulling 
over pictures and making small talk 
rather than actually spotting a spectacu-
lar bird in flight. 

Early on in the journey, we heard a 
upeep" from some nearby plants. Would 
this be the first bird of the day? As the 
older walker, Gil, wisely remarked, "It's 
one thing to hear 'em, it's another thing 
to see them." The group stopped and 
waited in hope of a sighting. In the 
meantime, Parlapiano provided a draw-
ing of the loud-mouthed creature: a 
White-Breasted Sparrow. After a few 
tninutes, when it became clear that the 
bird would not make an appearance, we 
trudged on. 

Parlapiano explained that the cold 
morning temperature and clouded light 
prevented many birds from leaving their 
resting habitat unlike me, the wise 
birds had chosen to stay in bed. 

Nonetheless, he said uyou shouldn't let 
the non-ideal day prevent you from 
birding." 

A bit farther along, we 
stopped again to ex~e movement in 
a bush. Looking through my binoculars 
for the first time, I realized how difficult 
it is to capture a still bird. "One thing 
you know about birds," said Parlapiano, 
uthey know exacdy when you pick your 
binoculars up." He laughed. 

Birding requires precision and 
patience. You can spend hours search-
ing for a specific bird and then, once 
you've spotted it, maintain that sighting 
for only a few seconds. Parlapiano 
emphasized how, through practice, birds 
become recognizable not only by their 
physical appearance, but also by their 
song. Since birdwatchers' eyes often fail 
them, they rely more on other senses, 
such as hearing, to distinguish one 
species from another. Later that morn-
ing, acute hearing led our group to 
uncover a female Downy Woodpecker 
circling the top of a tree trunk 
coolest bird I have ever seen. 

About halfway through the walk, we 
left the more dense vegetation and hit a 
wall of open space. This narrow clearing 
was devoid of the massive trees and clut-
tered foliage we had seen along other 
parts of the trail; it seemed an ideal place 
to rest. Desperate to ·see another bird, I 
focused my eyes and scoured the skies 
for sudden movement. Nothing. But 
then a sound- "vi-de-o vi-de-o vi-de-o 
, 
. 
vi-de-o, vi-de-o .... " The Carolina Wren. 

Seconds later, we heard more noise 
Com1non 
Yellowthroat 
then 
we 
watched it in flight. The tides had turned. 

· ~'I tell you, it's a great birding morning," 
said Parlapiano excitedly, ~'Everybody's 
moving." And by that point, at last, so 
were we.
