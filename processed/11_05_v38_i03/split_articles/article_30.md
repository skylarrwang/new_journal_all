jobs while trying to complete her current 
one. In order to focus once more on the 
creation of pure theater, Landowne 
decided to recreate the cabaret of her 
college years. 


She described the cabaret as "a place 
where it's more about hope and craft-
ing," a haven designed to restore the 
love of theater often tainted after gradu-
anon. 


"It's more about creating the work;' 
she explained: UNNYC does not bow to 
the pressure to produce a hit regardless 
of its artistic quality, a pressure prevalent 
in the professional theater world. 


Searching for a soft place to fall in the 
jagged landscape of the New York the-
ater scene, UNYYC has recreated a tiny 
bit of the Yale bubble in the modest the-
atrical space above Bennigan's. Far from 
being limited to artists, the nostalgic 
longing for what was once in college-
"the best years of our lives" is a uni-
versal sentiment. College holds the last 
vestiges of childhood; it's an incubator 
in which most Yale students can still 
enjoy limited responsibilities and total 
creative freedom without concern for 
when the next paycheck is coming or 
where they will sleep that night. 


The thought of leaving the warmth 
and comfort of the incubator is daunt-
ing, diploma in hand, forced to take on 
the world, ready or not. Some members 
of UNNYC have found the struggle to 
be far worse than it is for their I-banking 
colleagues. Competition is fierce, and 
although friends are still likely to cast 
friends (the Yale "mafia" does exist in 
New York), prospective collaborators no 
longer see each other in the dining halls 
or on the lawn, making connections hard 
to maintain and jobs harder to find. 


Economic need often outweighs the 
desire to create artistically meaningful 
work, a problem rarely encountered in 
the relatively free environment of drama 
school. The pressure to achieve immediate 
post-graduate success leads many 
actors to emphasize their best attribute 
and become typecast for a certain kind 
of role. "A lot of people are seen as only 
doing one kind of work," Landowne 
laments, brushing her hair away from her 
eyes, which are hidden behind a pair of 
black-rimmed glasses. Seven years out of 
drama school, she has found life on the 
outside to be fraught with the pitfalls of 
managing a career and living on a tight 
budget. Leaving the college bubble 
means that making theater will become a 
different process, but how exactly does it 
change? In the immortal words of Deep 
Throat: "Follow the money." 


College productions are usually fund-
ed by the school, which is in turn fund-
ed by tuition, donations and grants. The 
show does not have to be a hit. This 
gives crazy college kids the chance to be 
as experimental and self-indulgent as 
they want. Actors try their hand at 
directing while set designers become 
lead singers, all to the comforting 
applause of their friends in the audience. 
The university is a creative haven where, 
in the words of Crowley's Sir Thomas 
Wyatt, students can "write (create, act, 
sing) because they see things the way 
they are," not simply to entertain a pay-
ing audience. 


In the real world, however, theatrical 
productions have to earn money through 
ticket sales, or face bankruptcy. 
Constantly watching checkbooks, public 
opinion polls and Playbill grosses, pro-
ducers pressure their creative teams to 
shape their work into what they believe 
will make them the most money. Even 
regional and off-Broadway theaters, run 
as non-profit companies without the 
responsibilities to shareholders that 
commercial productions have, must still 
sell tickets and receive grants to survive. 
They, too, remain bound to the public's 
fickle opinion. 


So what does this all mean for 
UNYYC? 


A tiny theater above a bar, where 
actors will be applauded for their 
efforts while the audience politely 
ignores the waiter caught in the spot-
light, will probably not be too commer-
cially successful. However, if the 
UNYYC members can attract their fel-
low graduates who also yearn for a 
return to their bright college years, they 
can succeed in creating "a place where 
the audience is also a place for Yale 
people to meet," as Landowne hopes. 


By bringing together former class-
mates, new recruits, and an array of 
actors seeking artistic freedom and inno-
vation into an extended version of the 
Yale bubble, UNYYC may yield a suc-
cess more valuable than a Broadway hit.
