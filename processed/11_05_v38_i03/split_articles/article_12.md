**Trashy Magazines**
**Author: Sarah Larkow**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, THE FIFTY 
copies of The New York Times delivered 
to the Davenport College dining hall will 
disappear within three hours. The Yale 
Daily News might last from breakfast 
until dinner. Piles of The Yale Herald 
distributed on Friday at five vanish by 
Monday at two. Yet when issues of the 
popular campus tabloid Rumpus recently 
went missing from four colleges, the 
story made headlines. 

This year, Yale undergraduates will 
write, edit and publish over 35 
magazines. They range from The Yale 
Record, the University's long-running 
humor magazine, to Style, Yale's first 
and only fashion mag. Interested in 
Human Rights? Fishing? Classical 
Studies of Ancient Mesopotamia? Check 
the laden tables outside of any dining 
hall: somewhere in the piles of printed 
matter, the perfect magazine awaits. 
Unlike the YDN or The Herald, most of 
these publications will linger for a few 
weeks, trying to entice readers, before 
ending up where the missing piles of 
Rumpus were found—in the trash. 

Off-campus, "real" magazines need 
subscriptions and advertisers to justify 
their publication. Many student 
publications have neither and thus depend 
on sponsorship from Yale or outside 
interest groups. In an informal survey 
conducted by The New Journal, twenty 
campus publications reported their 
publishing costs, which range from $500 
to $7,000 per term, not including the 
YDN or The Herald. Combined expenses 
of these publications, per term, total 
$63,700. In comparison, the 
Undergraduate Organizations Funding 
Committee, which scrambles to fund a 
variety of student groups, has a budget 
of $90,000. 

For some niche interests, Yale prints 
more than one magazine. The cadre of 
campus conservatives somehow need 
both Light and Truth and The Free Press; 
gunslinger's indie rock reviews work 
hard to be hipper than The Herald's Arts 
& Entertainment section; and a series of 
college-specific lit mags give a voice to 
those writers who refuse the Yale 
Literary Magazine. 
THE NEW JOURNAL


In this world of literary magazines, the 
Ut, Yale's oldest magazine (over 160 
years old), easily dominates, often 
selecting as few as four poems from over 
one hundred submissions. Publisher 
Jonathan Sherman-Presser recognizes 
that the smaller alternatives serve as 
welcome venues in which more writers 
can publish their work. He adds, "The 
kind of publications that irk me are 
those that needlessly overlap on others' 
territory." As part of the founding team 
of P.H.: The Yale Journal of Public 
Health, he remembers a magazine with a 
similar health policy focus appearing 
just when P.H. was starting out. "In a 
field with as limited a draw for writers 
and editors as public health, there's 
neither a need nor the population to 
support two magazines," he says. 
Working together, the two sets of 
magazine founders could have better 
served the public health community. 

Such needless competition may 
contribute to the short lifespan of many 
publications. For every magazine that 
lasts for decades, like the Ut or The 
Record, there are countless magazines 
such as Wake, Jake, or Electric Fence 
which last only a few issues before 
disappearing. 

From his base at Manuscripts and 
Archives, Bill Massa, Head of 
Collection Development, fights to catch 
hold of each student publication no 
matter how fleeting its existence. Here, in 
the research room, squeaky glass cases 
surround scholars with memories of 
Yale: Yale books, Yale newsletters, Yale 
photo albums, and Yale student 
publications. The YDN is on microfiche 
here, all the way back to 1878. In this 
piecemeal history of Life at Yale, The 
Journal of Ethics, a well-heeled 
pomposity, ages alphabetically with The 
Eavesdropper, a sheaf of student 
gossip. All official Yale publications must 
donate two copies of each issue; but 
most of the publications actually find 
their way here from the Woolsey rotunda, 
the gym, or the Trumbull dining hall, 
where Massa, a fellow of the college, 
makes an effort to collect them. "It's a 
losing battle," he says. "Sometimes I 
feel like a publications bag lady." 

Manuscripts and Archives, the last line 
of defense against disappearing copy, 
aspires to be a bastion of young Yale 
genius, a safekeeping for the fledgling 
scribbles of great men and women. 
Although the library has the most 
complete run of any magazine, issues or 
even whole volumes are often missing 
from the record. Each year, a few Yalies 
come in search of literary glories past, 
often to find their words permanently 
lost. They, like today's Yalies, lacked 
foresight. Massa does his best to head off 
current students' future nos for their 
undergraduate prose before their words, 
like Rumpus, are thrown away. 

The culprit in the mystery of Rumpus' 
trashing remains at large, as does the 
perpetrator of a similar affront last year 
to The Free Press. But Stan Alcorn, a 
magazine editor himself (of the liberal 
Hippofytic), believes he saw the thief at 
work. 

The crime occurred in Jonathan 
Edwards college, in the course of a 
normal delivery of his magazine. After 
leaving one pile of magazines in the mail 
room, Alcorn moved onto the common 
room. When he returned a minute 
later, he saw a deliveryman from Turley, 
the Boston company that prints many of 
Yale's publications, leaving. His stack of 
Hippofytics was gone; in its place was 
The Herald. He hunted about for his 
magazines. There they were, in the 
trash, along with The Yale College 
Review of Books and P.H.—before 
anyone, including Massa, had a chance 
to pick one up.
