shelter behind the campus gates, 
waiting for an attack. Osborn wrote, 
"A Drum has beat & the Streets are 
crowded with the besieging army 
preparing for the assault." At nightfall, 
a mob of about six hundred men armed 
with pistols, clubs, and daggers hurled 
stones and burning coal at the medical 
building. They shouted "Tear down the 
college" and "Death to the students," 
drowning out the officers who tried to 
restore order by reading the state's Riot 
Act. Meanwhile, the medical students 
responsible for the body-snatching stole 
off amidst the chaos, never to be 
apprehended. The siege continued for 
two nights, and the state militia had to be 
called in to quell the riot. Despite a lack 
of evidence, the townspeople eventually 
found a scapegoat - in Ephraim Colborn, 
a medical assistant. He was sentenced 
to nine months imprisonment, fined $300 
dollars, and just barely escaped being 
tarred and feathered outside the 
courthouse. 


Yale was not the first institution to 
come under siege following the 
discovery of a disinterred body in its 
possession, and it would not be the last. 
Similar uprisings erupted in 
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and, most 
famously, New York - the 1788 
"Doctor's Riots." But by the end of the 
nineteenth century, legislation, combined 
with shifting attitudes towards dissection, 
finally provided physicians with enough 
legal cadavers to keep the doctors out of 
graveyards. By then, the image of 
"resurrectionists," as professional grave 
robbers were called, had already been 
fixed in the popular imagination. Portraits 
of these grim characters, creeping through 
midnight graveyards wielding pick-axes, 
shovels, and hooded lamps, as well as 
horrific portrayals of the cadavers' fates 
popped up in much of the literature of 
the time, from the graverobbing Dr. 
Robinson in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer 
to the creation of a grisly living cadaver 
in Frankenstein. 


Though the New Haven riot fueled 
sensational headlines in 1824, grave 
robbing by medical schools was old news 
to New Haven locals. By 1830, nine 
medical schools had been founded in New 
England alone, and more were added to 
the roster each year. Like Yale, all agreed 
that anatomy was a foundational course, 
and that dissection of a real human body 
was indispensable. 


But where would all these dead bodies 
come from? At the time, the only legal 
means of obtaining cadavers was from the 
bodies of executed murderers, a practice 
inherited from English Common Law. But 
in Massachusetts, for instance, only forty 
criminals were executed between 1800 and 
1830. Most medical schools legally 
received only one or two cadavers per year 
- a trickle that couldn't satisfy the 
swelling number of aspiring physicians. 


Thus, like its English counterparts, Yale 
medical students took to scouring the fresh 
graves of nearby cemeteries, often 
employing teams of experienced 
"resurrectionists" for the job. 


On that night in 1824, the 
perpetrators (no one knows for certain 
whether resurrectionists or the students 
themselves committed the crime) took a 
wagon to the West Haven cemetery. 
Carrying a hooded lamp to avoid catching 
the eye of anybody still awake, they would 
have spread a tarpaulin around the fresh 
grave to catch the dirt they unearthed. To 
save time and minimize disturbance, they 
would have only dug a hole at the head of 
the grave, then sawed through the top end 
of the coffin. Through the passageway they 
had created, they would have used a hook, 
made of an iron bar about five feet long, to 
extract the body headfirst. Back at the 
medical school, they may have first put 
Bathsheba's body inside one of the oblong 
niches cut into the walls of the cellar to 
store cadavers before concealing her 
beneath the stone floor. As far as hiding 
places went, Yale's were less sophisticated 
than those at its peer institutions; other 
medical schools often stored cadavers 
inside their domed roofs or fashioned 
pulleys to hoist bodies into the chimneys of 
large fireplaces. 


It is unknown just how many bodies were 
stolen throughout the nineteenth century. 
(One historian places the number at 
several thousand.) However, the extent to 
which lawmakers and the public perceived 
the problem to be widespread is 
well-established. By 1818, every New 
England state had passed laws against grave 
robbing, though only a handful of 
perpetrators were ever brought to court. 
The fear of being snatched away from one's 
final resting place was so great that 
measures to protect the dead often 
surpassed those to protect the living. The 
most basic method of keeping bodies 
underground was to pack the grave with 
bundles of straw, sticks, and large slabs of 
stone to slow down potential diggers. A 
more sophisticated variation was to place 
thick planks lengthwise across the coffin, 
forcing resurrectionists to exhume the 
entire grave. Other, usually more affluent 
New Englanders, preferred to hire a 
night-watch to sit beside a grave with a 
shotgun. The most grotesque tactic was to 
simply leave the body in a vault for several 
weeks, allowing the tissue to decompose 
past recognition and educational 
usefulness before burying it in a cemetery.


New Haveners' paranoia was no doubt 
stoked by similar events in Britain, where 
the threat of body snatching was so great 
that macabre ads selling iron coffins ran in 
the papers:


Many hundred bodies will be dragged from 
their wooden coffins this winter, for the 
anatomical lectures... The violation of the 
sanctity of the grave is said to be needful, 
for the instruction of the medical pupil, but 
let each one about to inter a mother, child, 
or friend, say shall I devote this object of my 
affection to such a purpose; if not, the only 
safe coffin is Bridgman's Patent wrought-iron 
one, charged the same price as a wooden 
one, and is a superior substitute for lead.


Not surprisingly, most of these 
preventative measures were financially 
unattainable for the poor, leaving them 
vulnerable to the late-night raids of nearby 
medical schools. Well aware of this, in 1788 
blacks living in New York City petitioned 
the Common Council to provide some degree 
of protection from resurrectionists. Their 
pleas were ignored. Most affluent whites 
took a cynical view, claiming that as long as 
"the only subjects procured for dissections 
are the productions of Africa" then surely 
no person can object." But resurrectionists 
were often willing to plunder the graves of 
poor whites as well; many medical schools 
targeted graveyards near almshouses. In an 
1878 interview, a graverobber, when asked 
whether he had ever been shot at, replied 
"Oh no, we let private cemeteries alone."


Ironically, the one legal channel for 
obtaining cadavers was largely to blame for 
much of the stigma attached to dissection. 
Donating the cadavers of executed 
murderers to science was not just an act of 
efficiency. The prospect of having one's 
body splayed open and taken apart was 
meant to act as a deterrent, a punishment 
reserved for the most abhorrent of 
murderers - creating a cultural 
association between dissection and 
criminality. 


Thus, the discovery of Bathsheba Smith's 
body concealed in the bowels of the Yale 
Medical College would have been cause for a 
particularly sharp sense of outrage. The 
daughter of a respectable, landed family, 
Bathsheba was certainly no criminal. So 
why should she share the fate normally 
doled out to the lowest individuals in 
society? 


And yet when the townspeople of New 
Haven picked up their pistols and clubs, 
they were expressing something deeper than 
the ever-present concerns of race, class, and
