Fork Lift 
IN THE COMMON ROOM OF A STILES 
freshman, proudly displayed between 
a poster of girls kissing and an empty 
bottle of rum, overlooking the X-Box 
and a dusty old rug, sit the crested 
plates from several of Yale's 12 resi-
dential colleges. The mythical beasts 
of Jonathan Edwards and Timothy 
Dwight, the quaint jleurs-de-lis of Ezra 
Stiles, the stoic battle axe of Morse-
all speak silently to a long tradition of 
Yale pride and theft. Hidden beneath 
jackets, stuffed into backpacks, and 
most often paraded out in plain view 
past the dining hall staff, myriad 
plates and cups make their 
way back to private pan-
theons every year. 

They can be found in 
every college and almost 
every entryway, hung tri-
umphantly above bunks 
and old futons. The tradi-
tion of plate stealing is 
not 
new: 
These 
makeshift shrines are 
as old as the residential 
colleges themselves. 
Flatware thievery dates 
back to the birth of the res-
idential college 
system. 
Originally, every dining hall 
had personalized 
silver 
flatware engraved with the 
college crest. However, 
even in the raccoon coat 
days of the 
1930s, the 
temptation 
to own the 
silver of 
one's 
own 
college 
proved too great for some Yale men. 
Servingware in the colleges dwindled to 
only a 
few dozen place-settings. 
Eventually, these survivors were 
retired to the Masters' Houses for 
safe-keeping and replaced with more 
affordable cutlery, while the aristo-
cratic plate settings were exchanged 
for cheaper ceramic ones. 
Several years ago, a Calhoun Master 
awoke to find a full set of stolen sil-
verware and eight to ten place settings 
at his door, along with an apology 
note from a penitent alum. 

According to Chuck Bennett, 
University Dining Service's Director 
of Support Services, Yale annual-
ly spends between $75,000 and 
$90,000 to replace stolen items. 
"We have no way of knowing 
how that china is lost," he says. 
This semester, Silliman 
College alone will order over one 
hundred new plates and 480 tum-
blers to replace those that have 
been stolen or broken. 'We know 
it happens," says John Morris, 
Director of Silliman's dining hall. 
"It's always a problem. Kids take 
them to their rooms and never 
return them." 
But, Yale's flatware fetish is 
not unique. According to Jami 
Snyder, Communications Director 
for Harvard University Dining 
Services, Annenberg, Harvard's 
freshman dining hall, loses 250 to 
three hundred dozen pieces of sil-
verware, 225 dozen tumblers, 
and around 150 dozen 
pieces of china annually, 
as well as entire pies, sev-
eral potted plants, and 
decorative pumpkins. In 
addition, House rivalries 
have sparked more large scale theft: In 
recent years, the Harvard dining halls 
have lost, among other things, a golden 
gong and a large ceramic elephant. 
Yale's current plates are manufac-
tured by Syracuse China Company, 
which, aside from a proud 150-year 
history of ceramic production, boasts 
substantial investments in such markets 
as oil and gas resources, heavy mining, 
iron and steel production, and com-
mercial lumber. A patriotic company, 
during World War II Syracuse even put 
its pottery expertise to use producing 
ceramic anti-tank mines for the US 
Army. Ironic that, while discussing 
drilling and economic imperi-
alism over Sustainable Food Project 
meals, Yalies are dining on (and collect-
ing) decorative little pieces of the mili-
tary-industrial complex. 

Futile attempts by dining hall man-
agers and college Masters to retrieve 
lost servingware include signs in the 
dining halls which read, "Please return 
stolen silverware" and an official poli-
cy of "blanket amnesty" for anyone 
returning missing goods. According to 
Morris, of the several hundred items 
lost or stolen from the Silliman dining 
hall each year, the custodial staff 
recovers only a few dozen. 

Why the tradition of plate theft 
at Yale has been and continues to be 
so strong is anyone's guess. Perhaps it 
derives from deep-seated college 
pride or the capricious greed of 
spoiled Ivy Leaguers; or maybe, as 
one Commons worker suggested, 
"The kids just need plates." 

Whatever the reason, the anony-
mous freshman and his suitemates are 
proud of their flatware collection. 
"The plates are cool. They're cool 
because they have, like, the shields on 
them," he says. "It's like when you go 
into someone's house and they have 
antique china on display. It looks cool. 
It makes the suite look nice. We have 
a competition with the suite below us 
to see who can get the most plates from all the 
dining halls first. We take the big ones, 
they take the small ones, and the suite 
across the hall steals mugs."
