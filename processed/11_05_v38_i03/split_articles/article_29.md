ostumes that appear to have 
been ftlched from a Medieval 
Times theme restaurant are 
carefully laid out behind a 
postage stamp-sized stage. The audience 
waits patiendy, toying with napkins and 
waiting for dinner to arrive, as the min-
utes tick away. 
Finally the house n1anager takes the 
stage to introduce the evening's entertain-
ment. He greets the audience informa11y 
and then offers the usual admonition to 
silence all cell phones: ''The actors will kill 
you if you don't turn them off." . 
After realizing that a few of the front 
row patrons seem to have slipped in 
without receiving programs, the director 
emerges from the woodwork (literally) 
and rushes around trying to fmd extras. 
Finally he leaps at an unsuspecting 
blonde seated stage left. "Did you read 
that already?" he anxiously asks the 
woman, reaching to pluck the program 
from her hands like a golden egg from a 
goose. Luckily, a stack of unclairned pro-
grams diverts his attention, and the play-
bill remains in the flustered blonde's 
gnp. 
And all of this is pre-show! 
This blend of chaos, spirit, and itnagi-
native theater lives on top of a Bennigan's, 
creating a highly unusual blend of bar 
snacks and sixteenth century history class 
in the core of the Big Apple. This is not 
just any Bennigan's. It is the one on the 
corner of Forty Seventh Street and Eighth 
Avenue 
Titnes Square, Manhattan, cen-
ter of American conunercial theater, 
home of Wicked, Hairsprt!J and Monty

Python's Spamalot. 
How did this deliberately low-budget 
theater end up in such glitzy company? 
The answer lies closer to York Square 
than Times Square. The endeavor is 
modeled after the original Yale Cabaret, 
a theater located on Park Street that 
stages bare-bones shows· after only a 
week of rehearsals .as a release from the 
tensions of rigorous drama school train-
ing. The resulting delightful romp 
through groundling theater is the pas-
sion of a morley group of Yale School of 
Drama graduate~ who . call themselves 
the Unofficial New York Yale Cabaret 
(UNYYC) 
pronounced with purpose 
as "unique." 
The creators of Yale Cabaret's new 
incarnation wanted to retain the theatri-
cal immediacy, creativity, and relaxed 
form of the original while freeing it 
from academia's influence. The anxieties 
of drama school have been replaced by 
the pressure of real life in Manhattan, 
prompting a redux of an old school tra-
dition to alleviate stress. 
The driving force behind these 
cabaret works is a deep reservoir of gut-
wrenching desire to create without criti-
cism, to make art for art's sake and not 
for the conunercial success that reigns 
over the rest of Broadway. 
But as anyone who has sat through 
an open-mic night knows, no amount 
· of heart can turn your next-door 
neighbor into a pop diva. If these 
UNYYC cohorts aren't looking for the 
acclaim craved by many theatrical 
artists (TONY TONY TONY) then 
•• 
what exactly are they creating? 
The company's inaugural production, 
Most Happy, was written and directed by 
UNYYC artistic director George· Tynan 
Crowley, who graduated from Yale School 
of Drama in 1990. It's a blithely simple 
one-act play exploring the complicated life 
__ , 
of Anne Boleyn. The o'l:--ea~ess actors 
energy and passion show in their ~mphat· 
ic diction and excited staging . .f\mbitious 
lines such as ''Art springs from truth," and 
''You're a poet, you're invested in delu· 
sion" aside, the play is engaging and light, 
while subdy educational. 
The actors' complex, detailed emotions 
are painted in broad, obvious strokes, 
favoring heightened drama over more 
accessible, believable naturalism. Popular 
opinion be damned! The point of this 
production is to portray the world from its 
creators' viewpoint. What they lack in 
slick showmanship, they compensate for 
in pure devotion to the theater.

long-time New York actor who plays 
Anne's love interest, Sir Thomas Wyatt,

has got a tremendous amount of heart, 
he said, "which tnakes up for a lot."

her career as a freelance director. She 
was nai.ve to the cold reality of living as

frustrated with the need to constandy
