The oldest black church in New Haven still stands proudly on Dixwell Avenue

TODAY, THE STRETCH OF DIXWELL AVENUE 
that 
runs 
from 
Payne 
Whitney 
Gymnasium to the Hamden border is 
lined with bus stops, quickie food joints, 
sagging houses and dozens of churches: 
grand brick ones, storefronts, stand-
alones. 

The 
Dixwell 
Avenue 
Congregational United Church of 
Christ doesn't look like any of them! 
With angular eaves jutting out in every 
direction and an empty moat circling its 
base, Dixwell Church looks more like a 
cement star. Founded in 1820, this 
strange castle is the oldest black church 
in New Haven, and the oldest black 
Congregationalist church in the country. 
For years, it was a stop on the 
Underground Railroad; in the Civil 
Rights era it supported demonstrators 
rallying on behalf of the Black Panthers. 

Sunday mornings tell a different 
tale. Most congregants arrive by car, 
driving in from Hamden or other out-
lying neighborhoods. They are an 
illustrious group. Carlton Highsmith, 
the US Department of Commerce 
minority businessperson of 2005, is a 
Dixwell Church member. John Daniels, 
first black mayor of New Haven, is in 
the men's choir. Natalie Hardy, who 
joined the church in 1928, was the first 
black girl in the country to be awarded 
the highest honor by the Girl Scouts. 
She lived on Dixwell, a few blocks 
down from the church, for over sixty 
years; now, she drives in from her 
Hamden home every Sunday morning.
