Just past midnight over 
180 years ago, the 
grave of 17 year-old 
Bathsheba Smith, the 
daughter of a West 
Haven farmer,-was 
found dug up, the coffin 
broken into, and 
the body missing. Horrified, the citizens of 
West Haven immediately pointed angry fingers 
at nearby Yale Medical College. The next 
morning, on January 12, 1824, public outrage 
forced New Haven's constable, Erastus 
Osborn, to lead a surprise search party into 
the medical school, then located on the corner 
of Grove and College Street where SSS now 
stands. The team searched the building from 
top to bottom to no avail. They were on the 
verge of quitting when they decided to peer 
into an unexplored subterranean room. 
Osborn related what followed in a letter to his 
father written later that same day:

place in the pavement (the Cellar being paved with 
large flat stones) which looked generally like the bottom 
of the Cellar throughout, but appeared to have a trifle 
of fresh dirt lying scattered about, hardly however discernible. I scratched with the end of my walking stick 
and the more I examined the more suspicion was entertained. We soon found the earth appeared fresher between 
the stones & finally took up a large flat stone where 
we discovered a white bundle, apparently a bundle of 
clothes. We examined & found a human body doubled up in a heap entirely covered up with the grave 
clothes. We took it out and it was immediately 
known to be the body of the young Woman we was 
searching for. 

Jonathan Knight, a Yale anatomy professor, 
denied any knowledge of the business and 
arranged for the body to be wrapped discreetly 
in a cap and sheet and loaded into a wagon 
bound for West Haven. But word of the discovery spread quickly. Crowds of citizens 
thronged the wagon as it moved down College 
and Chapel Streets. Osborn's letter tells of several bells pealing at once, whipping the mass 
into a "great pitch" as the town filled with 
rumors. Yalies armed themselves and took
