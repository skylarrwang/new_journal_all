staffer Maureen Miller. "We had a 
few people though, me included, 
who thought it was brilliant." 
Ultimately, the shirt failed. 
This year's design steps back 
slightly: Staffers debated over a 
shirt that would be "offensive 
but 
not too offensive." Ideally, the crew 
would like to actually turn a profit, 
which they have in the past: Their 
very first design sported a line-
drawing of the phallic Harkness 
tower, accompanied by the biting 
text: "Harvard Sucks. But Yale 
Sucks Better." The profit they made 
on that visual "gag" allowed them 
to print their publication monthly 
a huge step financially. 

Sigma Alpha Epsilon's pledges 
sell shirts "to raise money for their 
pledge 
project 
usually 
an 
improvement to the infrastructure 
of the house. ''For example,'' said 
Fraternity president Billy Deitch, 
"rebuilding the basement bar." Two 
years ago the frat put out one of 
the most successful shirts in recent 
memory, 
the 
front of which 
argued, "You'd have to be crazy to 
go to Harvard.;." and the back of 
which provided evidence: a picture 
of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, 
Harvard Class of 1962. A later 
shirt was more minimal in design, 
"VE-RI-DUM," which Branford 
Senior Jonathan Breit claimed as 
his 
favorite 
game 
shirt: 
"Everything is perfect: the number 
of syllables, the latin-esque ending 
of 'dum,' the fact that 'dumb' is 
misspelled. It just works." 

This year for the first time, 
Community 
Health 
Educators 
(CHE) 
a group of student sex 
educators who work at New 
Haven high schools 
plans to 
print a socially conscious t-shirt. 
"Many of the designs we were 
debating said something to the 
effect of 'Herpes ... Heptatitis ... 
HPV... Fuck Harvard. -But use a 
condom," wrote Cara Demmerle, 
CHE co-coordinator. "Ultimately,

we were worried that students 
might not want a t-shirt with 
'Herpes' written in 
on the 
front .. ; The final design does 
make a joke at · abstinence's 
expense, but I think it is ulti-
mately much more palpable than 
the earlier designs." As opposed 
to the frats and .humor maga-
zines, CHB was hesitant to print 
on Campus Coponis' t-shirts 
because they ' ~~~e . produced in 
sweatshops. The ;group went for 
more expensive tees offered by 
American Apparel; a chain that 
sells bulk rates on shirts made in 
regulated working conditions. 

Like CHE, the club Water 
Polo team wanted their design to 
fit their moral code 
a record of 
good sportsmanship. "We wanted 
a shirt that was more clever," said 
Fundraising Coordinator Sherry 
Wang. "We didn't want a shirt 
like 'Who's your Daddy,' or 
'Harvard's mom since 1701.'" 

Last year, the team released the 
heart-warming "Everybody loves 
a Yalie" shirt, which sold like a 
pack of Camels in a Texas 
prison. This year's design is similarly 
uncontroversial: a group of 
scarlet stick-figures holding up 
placards 
spelling 
"Harvard 
Sucks," and on the b~ck, Yalies 
say: "You said it, not us," alluding 
to-a prank played last year on 
the Harvard fans. 

For the two weeks before the 
game, a row of fold-out tables in 
the foyer of Commons becomes a 
makeshift bazaar of Game tees for 
passing Yalies. "What is this?" a 
girl 
asked 
one 
Monday 
in 
November, passing the table commandeered by members of the 
Pundits society. She was pointing 
to 
a 
t-shirt 
printed 
in the 
University's font, which simply 
said, "ALE," sans igrec. "It's Yale 
without the 'Y,"' said the staffer 
selling the shirt, "It's the essence 
of Yale. There are youth sizes!" 
When the customer walked away 
to a table offering the usual bland 
fare 
("Harvard 
Sucks. 
And 
Princeton Doesn't Matter"), the 
Pundit sighed. "It's the most 
straightforward design possible." 

Though the Harvard-Yale 
design is often straightforward, 
it has come a long way from the 
game itself, and few shirts ever 
have anything at all to do with 
football. "No one cares who 
wins," said one drunken senior at 
a party two weeks before kickoff. 
"Everyone cares who had · the 
fucking coolest shirt." The Yale 
Record's elegant satire from 2001 
summed up what a lot of people 
felt. As their number-one suggestion, the magazine proposed 
a shirt that would be blank 
except for one block of text. 
"My hatred for Harvard," it 
would read, "outweighs my apathy 
for football."
