For students in areas that are 
scantily populated by Yale alumni, a 
visit from a Student Ambassador may 
be their first contact with the 
University 
a weighty role for an 
undergraduate to play. On my own 
return to my high school, I arrived 
expecting a figurative victory lap but 
left feelirig as though I'd been dragged 
down the bleachers: Although undeni-
ably bright-eyed, the students I spoke 
to needed more help than I could pro-
vide. When faced with an application 
process in which a single adtuissions 
officer seems to be the judge, jury, and 
executioner, an 18 year-old is desper-
ate for someone 
anyone 
to be' his 
or her college counselor, SAT tutor, 
and essay editor. 
Evidendy, the greatest discrepancy 
between Kadue and Facemyer's expe-
riences isn't actually caused by their 
interactions with the University before 
matriculation, but rather the stark dis-
parity between their respective high 
schools 
an inequa1ity that lies out of 
40 
veru 
professors when possible, and did his 
or her best to make our application 
the best that it could be. [There was] a 
dedicated team of advisors who were 
conversant with the American college 
admissions climate and understood 
the process from an insider's perspec-
tive." Facemyer paints a different pic-
ture of the application process. 
"There were four guidance counselors 
for my school, which has a little over 
one thousand students. One student 
applied to Yale 
myself and one girl 
went to U Penn. No one else even 
applied to Ivy League schools that 
year, and I was the only person from 
my school ever to go to Yale." 
His assessment points to the larg-
er problem at hand; in a world 
where class often determines access 
to such tools as college counselors 
and SAT preparation courses, stu-
dents from lower incomes often 
lack the necessary means to com-
pete in the admissions process. 
Syverud noted that "admissions pol-
icy says that background is impor-
tant, but it's be~n proven that there's 
no admissions advantage for stu-
dents ftom lower iricome back-
grounds. We need to target these 
applicants, but it's difficult .because 
we use need-blind admittance." 
The question of how Yale 
can compensate for this deficit 
or if 
it is the . University's job to do so at 
all 
is a motivating force behind the 
Student 
Ambassador 
program. 
eserve a

According to Syverud, the project is 
"a way to recognize that students who 
aren't from prep and feeder schools 
don't receive the same sort of help. 
Their guidance counselors aren't call-
ing Yale Admissions to brag about 
them. They deserve a leg up." . 
The mechanism they hope will 
enact this "leg up" is not a change in 
the adnrission process, but rather an 
increased attention to disserninating 
information about Yale into the hands 
of a broader audience. The Student 
Ambassadors 
sent 
out 
over 
Thanksgiving Break will be urged to 
spread . a specific conununique to the 
masses: Yale has a lot of money, and it 
wants to gt.ve 1t to you. 
"[We] created the Ambassadors 
Progra•n to send a message that high-
er education is an affordable option 
for all high school students, no tnatter 
their income levels," said Quinlan, 
who called the initiative an outgrowth 
of the University's recent financia1 aid 
developments. '~inancial aid policy,

especially a hundred per cent need-
based financial aid and our new 
enhancements for low-income stu-
dents and families, is definitely some-
thing we want to talk about and 
explain as we recruit." 
The new 
enhancements that Quinlan alludes to 
are part of recent sweeping changes in 
Yale's financial aid offerings. Last 
spring, 
members 
of 
the 
Undergraduate 
Organizing 
Committee staged a campaign for 
such changes that culminated in 
February with a sit-in .at the Office of 
Undergraduate Adrnissions. Although 
many of the protesters are still push-
ing for more reform, the new policy is 
indisputably far-reaching. In March, 
the Universfty._announced that, as of 
this year, if would no longer require 
any financiar contributio_.Q.-from 'fami-
" 
lies with total incJt1ffies under $45,000 
' 
a year, as wei]}: as ~ pr~viOing generous 
v 
packages to th9~fe~ -ning less than 
$60,000. The website for the admis-
sions office now boasts, "The 2005-
2006 academic year marks an impor-
tant milestone year for Yale's under-
graduate financial aid program." 
For Syverud, these changes are not 
a conclusion to the battle for closing 
the education gap, but rather a means 
to an end. "I firmly believe that a 
discussion of financial aid at Yale 
should also deal with the issue of high 
school recruittnent, because the two 
are related," he said. ''I'd like Yale to 
be at the forefront of reaching out to 
lower income students. I think that, 
coupled with Yale's new financial aid 
policy, this program will potentially set 
off changes in other Ivy League 
schools. I bet Harvard will make large 
scale changes to its own policies, and 
I'd be surprised if they don't also 
il nplement a more comprehensive 
recruitment program." 
In addition to emphasizing Yale's 
commitment to pursuing students 
from low income backgrounds, the 
joint force of the YCC and the adnus-
sions office is also working to support 
applicants from under-represented
November 2005 
schools by building relationships with 
those schools. One of its aspirations is 
to implement a program in which 
incoming students would nominate 
teachers from their high schools for 
recognition. 
SyVerud 
added, "We're also trying to b~d out-
reach to guidance counselors, who 
have better opportunities to interact 
with the students. We want them to 
know how important this is to Yale." 
Critics of the adrnissions office 
might ask how important low-income 
recruitment actually is to Yale. Why, 
for example, is the University sending 
undergraduate students to previously 
unrecognized schools instead of 
divesting admissions officers from sat-
urated areas? 
Syverud and Quinlan 
are quick to point out that the adnlis-
sions staff is already spread thin 
across the country, reading nearly 
twenty thousand applications for the 
Class of 2009, and both cite the 
advantages 
that 
a 
Ambassador brings to the table. 
Lauren Ezell, 
a Student 
Ambassador who has been assigned 
to speak at a public magnet high 
school in Tennessee, agreed. ''A stu-
dent's perspective is perhaps more 
candid," 
she said. "The students 
selected for the job are probably as 
qualified to 'sell' the school as an 
adrnissions officer." Syverud added to 
this statement, "I think it's more effec-
tive to hear someone from yoW: ~ea 
with a similar experience to yourself. 
Students are also often more straight-
forward, because they lack the sort of 
mandatory 'company 
loyalty' of 
admissions officers, who are ultitnate-
ly Yale employees." 
Whether students wil1 be sold by 
recruiters who may be 'only two or 
three years their seruor is yet to be 
detern •ined. In December, the YCC 
and the Yale adnlissions office will 
assess the success of the progran1, 
after the Ambassadors return to Yale 
with questions, anecdotes, and lists of 
interested students. While an evalua-
tion of these student experiences, and 
. the responses of the schools selected 
for the program are detertninants of 
the program's success, Syverud sug-
gested that the overa~ching goals of 
the project are larger in scale. 
"There are two clashing principles 
at play here, and Yale needs to decide 
which one it wants to subscribe to," he 
said. "The first is that we can use this 
program to find the diamonds in_ the 
rough 
spectacular applicants who 
will come, be accepted, and perform 
excellendy. The other goal is to 
change 
admissions 
process 
beyond Yale. To pursue that will be 
difficult, because Yale ultimately 
works to benefit Yale." 
Syverud hopes to continue to 
address the inequalities that students 
from different backgrounds face in 
the application process, including 
holding a conference where primary 
figures in higher education discuss the 
matter. He concluded, optimistically, 
"I think that people care a lot about 
the issue·, because education is sup-
posed to be a mecharusm for social 
mobility. It's Yale's job to ensure that 
we match that promise." 
The extent to which this promise 
can be realized by a group of fresh-
faced undergraduates eager to spread 
the Yale gospel remains to be seen. In 
my own experience, it was worth tak-
ing the tirne to speak 
albeit in a 
nervous and ill-prepared manner 
to 
a group of students who might not 
otherwise be exposed to Yale. I 
walked away from my session with a 
-belief in the importance· of expanding 
recruittnent, and a renewed apprecia-
tion for the help that I received when 
applying to college. Several months 
later, the boy in the suit and the over-
sized glasses wrote me to say that he 
was walking away from our high 
school with letters of acceptance to 
Hat vard and Yale.
