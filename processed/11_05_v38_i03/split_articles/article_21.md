back to the dilemma of Western medi- · 
cine: Rising prices are driving people 
towards cheaper new age therapies 
that they may not fully understand, 
but that make them feel better. "I'm 
just working my business. . . I need to 
make a living; I need to pay my bills." 
Sal says he's not even sure if his busi-
ness is making money . but he is 
smart. By anticipating a trend, he may 
he on Jhe cusp of success. 
But for the moment, he can only 
do what he does best heal. A young 
wotnan has 41rrived at Amadeus HeaHng 
Center looking qistraught and appoint-
ment ... less, so Sal agrees to squeeze her 
in an \llllik.ely leniency at a traditional 
doctor's offi.ce~d ushers me into the 
treatment room with hisn. She is feeling 
very emotional about · 
I set myself 
in the comer of the room, which is dec-
orate~ with Native American regalia-
feathers, hides .and ·dotted with all 
kinds of bottles and what I can only 
guess are Sal's "tools." First a · 
· 
He palpates her abdom~n to find the 
tender spots and concludes, "She is very 
stressed." Next, he takes her pulse, 
looks for a 
between the carotid 
.and radial arteries, and it becomes very 
obvious to hi•n to that the left side of 
her body is imbalanced. His movements 
are quick but meticulous. H~ scuffles 
around, grabs 
from a shelf, 
and opens a box with stnaJI silver and 
gold press-tacks. He rips the plastic 
open with his teeth, extracts 
the tacks, and presses them into her fin-
gers, pahn side ·up. He repeats this sev-
eral risnes, a practice that gives new 
meaning to the word "thumb-tack." 
I could never have anticipated what 
he does next. He grabs a needle gun, 
tells the patient to ''breathe in," and 
shoots an acupuncture needle between 
the two tacks. ''This is going to help her 
with anxiety ... balance the root of her 
problem:. . and also address the symp-
tom," he says, eyes on the patient who 
has hers closed tight. In the corner, 
awestruck, afraid to ask if it hurts, I just · 
nod, as I position my chair so the patient 
can .rest her needle-ridden arm on it. 


''If I had more ri•ne, I would put 
castor oil on her abdomen with white 
wool flannel; but because I don't have 
enough ti•ne, I'm just going to use a 
Ja•np;' Sal said. I have never seen a 
la1np like this before. It has seven long, 
skinny bulbs in the colors associated 
with each chakra. He carefully places it 
close to her abdomen. The specialized 
treaunent Sal has just concocted for 
this young woman exemplifies his 
notion of what medicine should be-
"hwnan and hmnane." As he says, it 
does not treat people like "car parts." 
"I feel good, I feel the energy;' the 
womari says, and then after a moment, 
"Amanda said I had issues with my 
third eye chakra." 
Sal inunediately 
knows what to do. He sticks an 
acupuncture needle in the smaJl space 
between her eyebrows. "She said I had 
issues with grounding," the woman 
continues. Sal has an answer: ''Imagine 
the roots coming from your feet 
par-
ticularly kidney one which is at the bot-
tom of your foot. . . gently contract 
· your anus to bring energy up." After all, 
he is the doctor . 



**The Scientific Rigor of CAM**
**Page number(s): 22-23**

"I AM THE VICE-CHAIR OF THE 
department of Anesthesiology, the 
Anesthesiology Chief of Yale-New"".-
Haven Children's Hospital, and the'' 
-
~ 
Professor of Anesthesiology, Pediatrics, 
and Child Psychiatry at Yale University," 
says Dr. Zeev Kain, a slender, clean-
shaven man who has just stored his 
lunch in the fridge and filled his coffee 
mug. As if Dr. Kain does not wear 
enough hats, he is also a researcher: He 
studies 
the 
perioperative 
stress 
response 
the responses of a patient 
before, during, and after surgery. 'We 
do research involving pharmacological 
interventions, behavioral interventions, 
as well as CAM interventions ... We do 
exceptionally rigorous science;' he says. 
''In the world of CAM, exceptionally 
rigorous is not always the case. That is 
one of the problems." 

Dr. Kain, who is also part of one of 
the prestigious National Institute of 
Health study groups, offers a perspec-
tive based on his medical expertise and 
a unique international insight 
he was 
born in Israel. "The U.S. is really the 
country of the free... Doctors of 
osteopathies, podiatrists, optometrists: 
these entities do not exist in Europe. 
It's all the same with CAM therapy-
somebody wants to say they're a thera-
pist, all they need to do is put a shingle 
on and say 'I'm a therapist."' 


Dr. Kain calls for a more institu-
tionalized basis for CAM, one that 
would make it less of an industry and 
more of a science. "It is a very com-
mon sentitnent that anything that 
smells like CAM has nothing to do 
with science. However, over the past 
ten years there have been tremendous 
changes around the world 
you can 
see articles published of CAM inter-
ventions in multiple top-of-the-line sci-
entific journals." 

Dr. Kain is leading by example, 
advocating change by conducting 
exceptional research, but his voice is 
only one in a small chorus of doctors 
and scientists around the world. "One 
of the ieaSons why it's changing slowly 
is because there are a lot of charlatans 
... 
in the world ,af CAM therapy. And so 
every Joe"bpet;if~g,JJ: clinic of acupunc-
ture charges·r - ~iiry;buc~s . a shot and 
,. _,. 
.. 
does sometHing that may or may not 
help." His research group, including 
the esteemed Dr. Shu-Ming Wang, 
international acupuncture expert, 
and Dr. Halaeh Sadat, the leading 
authority on hypnosis, is fu1611ing 
a scientific responsibility to the 
greater 
cormnunity 
of 
patients 
contributing to CAM 
literature to show what gets 
results, and what doesn't. 


**Yale and CAM**
**Page number(s): 23**

Because the dis-
course that Dr. Kain 
and his renowned 
research 
teana 
engage in is rele-
v a 
five 
n 
t 
years 
ago, 
National 
Institute 
of Health, the pulse of the medical 
world, established an institute for alter-
native medicine it would seem logical 
that Yale, as a visionary institution, 
would want to invest in the future of 
CAM. It would be easy for them to 
back more projects like Dr; Kain's and 
the two or three other CAM research 
groups at the University. 

After all, Harvard has appropriated 
such monies. The Harvard Medical 
School Osher Institute is arguably the 
most progressive institution in the 
world when it comes to education and 
research regarding CAM therapies. Not 
only does it support multiple impres-
sively-sized research groups, but it has 
worked to incorporate CAM therapies 
into the curriculum of the Medical 
School. Yale, · by contrast, takes an 
unflinching old guard view of CAM. 

Reiki programming at Yale-New 
Haven may represent the New Haven 
patient's interest more strongly than it 
does Yale's. 

"The list of things that have been 
documented to work is quite 
short," says Dr. Kain of specific 
CAM techniques. But CAM 
therapies have a predeter-
mined future. As much as 
they will be incorporated 
into traditional medicine, 
they will never replace it. 
''Let's be realistic, if you 
have appendicitis, we 
need to take your 
appendix out ... 
So I believe in 
what's called 
Inte-
grate 
Western traditional medicine 
which 
is the gold standard for me. . . and you 
add to it. a piece from eastern medicine 
that helps." 

One question is whether Yale will 
adapt to this model and do some inte-
grating of its own of CAM research 
and education in its curriculum. Perhaps 
Yale should model itself after Dr. Kain: 
traditional at heart, but innovate. and rel-
evant. "Eventually institutions. . . will 
have to go with the flow. It's just a ques-
tion of 'are you going to flow today, 
three years from now, or five years from 
now?' You will have to go with the flow." 


**Reiki: A Personal Experience**
**Author: Romy Druckefj**

I CAN CHOOSE TO BEIJEVE THAT REIKI 
is unscientific and that Claire, Amanda, 
and Sal do not have healing hands. I can 
choose to believe that what I felt when 
I got Reiki was psychological.· I can 
choose to believe that Reiki is just a glo-
rified massage. But I don't want to 
believe that. I want to think that over 
the next week, I will feel more relaxed. 
M energy levels will catapult and I will 
fe 1 refreshed, that I can turn to Reiki 
n~xt tirne I need relie£ I felt it. I experi-
enced it. I am one chapter in a body of 
evidence, and no doctor can tell me 
otherwise. For this moment, I'm as 
good as the best science they've got. 

Most CAM therapies like Reiki may 
not be scientifically proven to work, but 
for a few minutes or an hour, they tnake 
the patient his or her own doctor. They 
give you a sense of control; and even if 
they are only relaxing you, that relax-
ation improves quality of life and likely 
promotes healing. Ken Welch only has 
vague reminiscences of Claire working 
on hitn before and after his colon sur-
gery. But for the tirne she was with him, 
and for the tirne she was with me, what 
Ken and I both had was perhaps more 
irnportant than pills or splints. It was 
· the agency to heal ourselves, and that 
can never be proven otherwise .
