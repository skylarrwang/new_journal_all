NUMBER OF MATRICULATED STUDENTS

5 oine institutions even send more students to Yale than entire states. 
"I'm not an admissions officer. I'm 
fall of 2005. 
just a student." 
His eyes widened with despair, 
and, in his oversized glasses, I saw a 
reflection of my high school self-
eager to please, overachieving, and 
desperate to get into a good school. I 
hesitated, then . took the ream of 
forms from his outstretched arms. 
"Let's take a look at this together." 
A YEAR AGO, I PARTICIPATED IN A 
Yale program that encouraged stu-
dents to return to their high schools 
and give "Thanksgiving Information 
Sessions" 
brief visits intended to 
publicize the University, solicit stu-
dents to apply, and build relationships 
with schools in geographic regions 
rarely visited by official recruitment 
officers. Unbeknownst to its partici-
pants at the tirne, the project was an 
unofficial prototype for a large-scale 
proposal that would be realized in the 
38 
This new initiative, the Student 
Ambassadors Program, is a collabora-
tion between the Yale College Council 
and the University's admissions office. 
Steven Syverud, President of the 
YCC, began campaigning for the proj-
ect shortly after he assumed office. 
''We wrote a resolution to improve 
admissions tactics in January," he said, 
"because many of us were strongly 
interested in low income recruitment. 
All semester, I went to the admissions 
office every week, asking, ~e we 
going to do this program?' 
Jeremiah Quinlan, a Yale adrnis-
sions officer, was adamantly in favor 
of the idea from its inception. "The 
Yale adrnissions office is always trying 
to improve our recruiting efforts as 
we continue to strive to bring a diverse 
freshman class to this campus," he 
said. In seeking to broaden these 
efforts, the program's architects sent 
• • 
out an open application call this 
September, via e-mail, for "ambassa-
dors." The tone of the first e-mail 
appealed to the student body's devo-
tion to the University 
a sort of "for, 
God, for Country, and for Yale" pitch. 
''We hope this program will become a 
Yale tradition," it read, a tradition in 
which students would "be paid $50 
for their first visit and $20 for each 
visit after that." 
While Yale will not release the 
official number of student ambassa-
dors until after Thanksgiving Break, 
when their visits have been clocked 
in, Syverud hinted that the figures 
were impressive. "The original plan 
was to send fifty students out; but 
we underestimated the interest that 
the idea would elicit 
about three 
hundred students' applied." Accepted 
ambassadors were then trained 
to 
·-
a greater degree than I wa~ and 
given an overview of the purposepf 
their visits.

The schools targeted by the initia-
tive were chosen according to guide-
lines devised by the admissions office 
and the YCC. First, the program's cre-
ators asked: How many students at the 
school is question are scoring 1300 or 
higher on their SATs? Then, are 
enough of those students applying to 
Yale? The third consideration, noted 
Syverud, was the average income level 
of the students. Though, he adrnitted, 
the system is "sort of an inexact sci-
ence," he affirmed that "if two 
. schools had evenly matched test 
scores, we went to the lower income." 


While the goals of the program-
increasing low-income recruitment 
and broadening geographic distribu-
tion 
may seem unsnt pris~g in the 
contemporary 
·context 
of 
the 
University's liberal atmosphere, Yale's 
drive to realize them is a fairly recent 
development. Syverud, who is writing 
his senior essay on the subject, points 
to the Yale of forty years ago. '1:n 
terms of adrnissions," he said, ''Yale 
was the tnost conservative of the Ivy 
Leagues. We used to send the entire


office to prep schools like Andover 
and Exeter for weeks at a· tirne, with 
entire rating systems devoted to those 
institutions." . He paused, then added 
with a tone of hushed adrniration: ''All 
that changed with Inslee Clark." 
Clark, who became the director of 
adnlissions at Yale in 1965, essentially 
blew down the doors to the old boys' 
club of college adrtlissions. Working 
with the University's liberal president, 
Kingman Brewster, he argued that 
Yale should seek out the most quali-
fied candidates from around the coun-
try rather than focusing on elite prep 
schools _populated by students with 
appropriate social upbringings. 
· Clark's initiatives, recounted 
Syverud, ~aused an uproar. Furious 
Yale alumhi ~ppealed to Brewster and 
the Yale Corporatiqn . to revoke its 
new liberal ... poli?_es. 'J)leir argument,

background to become solid leaders. 
In response, Clark avowed that the 
leaders of the future would emerge 
from untraditional sectors of society. 
Brewster agreed. As an undergraduate 
in the late 1930's, he once wrote in the 
Yale Daify News, ''The world we shall 
live and work in is being refashioned. 
or 
Parts of the Yale machinery that are 
· rusty with complacency and stiff with 
tradition will have to be hauled out 
and re-exan1ined." 
As President, 
Brewster's position enabled hin1 to 
implement these lofty ideals by revo-
lutionizing the University's recruit-
ment policy. 

Decades later, however, the per-
centage of private school . students at 
November 2005 
Yale remains a point of contention. In · 
an e-mail urging students to apply for 
the Student Ambassadors program, a 
representative 
from 
Asian 
American Students Association stated, 
''Anyone who cares at all about Yale 
branching out beyond its feeder prep 
schools needs to pay attention. Even if 
you went to a feeder prep school." 
While the fmancial, ethnic, and geo-
graphic spread of Yale students-
Quinlan pointed out that the student 
body now "consists of students from 
all 50 states in addition to 7 4 countries 
outside of the United States" 
has 
grown remarkably, the ratio between 
students from public and private 
schools is still unbalanced. Currendy, 
just over half of the student body 
comes from the public school system, 
a percentage that hardly reflects the 
national makeup; according to the 
1990 census, 88 per cent of American 
youths were enrolled in public school. 
Some private institutions even send 
more students to Yale than entire 
states 
Harvard-Wesdake, a private 
school in California, sent twelve stu-
dents to Yale in 2003, as opposed to 
eight from the entire state of Indiana. 
Quinlan argued, however, that this fig-
ure is no longer a consequence of 
• zn 
er on 
ezr 
recrUitment policy, but ipstead reflects 
the nmnber of applications. 
"One of the larger factors in deter-
rnining territories is actually the mun-
ber of applications that an area will 
produce 
each 
year," 
he 
said. 
''Adn»issions officers are not only 
responsible for traveling to their terri-
tories, but also for reading all of the 
applications from those areas. Once 
an officer receives their territory, they 
are able to use a variety of research 
tools, past advice, and statistics to 
determine what schools or cities to 
visit in their territory." As a result, 
some officers have to stretch visits 
across broad geographic regions in 
order to sift through as many applica-
tions as a coworker assigned . to a 
handful of private institutions. · 
Baolu Lan, a senior who attended 
the prestigious PhiJiips Academy in 
Andover, Massachusetts, adds that the 
inflated · nun1ber of students from 
institutions like Andover may simply 
reflect the nature of the schools 
themselves. "I think that the high cal-
iber and wide-ranging diversity of the 
best students from these extremely 
selective boarding schools justify the 
proportion of them," she said. 
''Andover selects students from all 
around the country who are at the top 
of their classes and show exceptional 
promise at an early age: Yale is essen-
tially admitting kids from a pre-
screened applicant pool." 
Lan 
affirmed that the relation is correla-
tive, not causal. 

Still, there in an undeniable dispar-
ity between how far Yale goes to 
establish a presence for itself at differ-
ues -zon are scor-
ent schools. c'In addition to Yale's 
annual visit to our school, I'm pretty 
sure that there was other cornmnnica-
tion," said junior Katie Kadue, an 
alnrnna of Hat vard-Wesdake. <The 
guidance counselors were evasive 
about how close their ties were with 
colleges, but they all ~ad experience 
on the other side of the admission 
process, and they seemed to have cspe-
