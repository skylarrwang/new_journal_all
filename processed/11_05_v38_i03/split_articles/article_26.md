of Puritanism had lost its firm hold

on New Englanders. Puritanism's
emphasis on the physical tortures
of hell was actually a kind of prepa-

Puritans viewed the decay of a
corpse after death as indicative of
human sin, making dissection less
of a sacrilegious concept, though
by no means an acceptable one. The
growing demand for cadavers hit
New England at the same time that
attitudes towards dea.th
and famil-
iarity with the threat of posthu-
mous physical destruction
had
begun to shift.

As Puritanism faded from view,
Victorian primness began to take
hold. Increasingly, people in the
Northeast
sentimentalized
bodies of the· dead. It became
common around this time to hold
on to keepsakes, typically a lock of
hair, from the deceased. In the lat-
ter half of the century, post-
mortem pictures also spread in
popularity, taken in the hopes of
clinging to an imperishable image
of loved ones.

This idealized vision of the
body as a memorial unfortunately
coincided with the growing pains
of modern medicine. Nineteenth-
century America needed more doc-
tors, and some of the dozens of
medical colleges that suddenly

room," where body parts had been
strung up in "a most brutal posi-
tion."· At the same time that the
general public began to collect
postmortem photographs, medical
students began their own under-
ground genre, trading amongst
each other gruesome · snapshots
taken inside the hallowed dissect-
ing room. When Erastus Osborn
uncovered Bathsheba's body in the
cellar, the townspeople were forced
to hold these two opposing con-
cepts of death in contradistinction.

Today at Yale Medical School,
the approach couldn't be more dif-
ferent. For one, bodies are now
voluntarily donated rather than
taken from open graves. Before
ever stepping into the anatomy
lab, first-year students hear a talk
by second-years who stress the
sacrifice that "donors"
as the
bodies are called
have made in
giving their bodies to the medical
school and the respect they should
be accorded. Justin Chen, a sec-
ond-year, said that the first time
his class saw the cadavers, they
were told, "Now you are going to
meet your donor."

brought this home bec~use ·-[the

"'~
apart." Both Chen and his 1824
predecessors hit on one of the (un-
damental <.:onflicts of medicine:
Doctors must look at the body both
as a person to be healed and a spec-
imen to be examined. Julia Bess
Frank, a doctor at the Yale Medical
School in the 1970s once explained,
"Medicine, as a serving profession,
is accorded great license, permis-
sion to inflict all sorts of pain and
indignity on patients, doing bad in
order to prevent worse, in ho.pes of
curing disease."

Meanwhile, outside the medical
school walls, the rose-washed
Victorian view of death persists.
At the Beecher and Bennett
Funeral Home in Hamden, CT,
trained staff members work to
meet the expectations of -grieving
families.
According
to
Erin
Hastings, a funeral director and
embalmer at Beecher and Bennett,
many family members care most
about "the way the deceased
looks." Most of the time, she says,
"they've seen their loved ones ...
go through a lot of pain, so when

they can come in and see them
lqoking peaceful, that's .a last
image they're going to have in
their head." When preparing the
body for burial, she says, "We
take a lot of time when we're
doing our job as embalmers and
cosmeticians: getting their hair
right, making sure that every-
thing is neat and orderly."

Though the students in 1824
robbed a West Haven cemetery
instead of the more conveniently-
located cemetery across the
street, it seems fitting that the
medical school · and the Grove
Street Cemetery now stand at
oppos.ite ends of Yale's campus.

Yale anatomy -students prepare a
remembrance for their -donors.
In the Medical Historical Library,
nestled amidst the collected
knowledge of generations of
doctors before them, they read
poetry, perform music, and pres-
ent photo exhibitions in the
donor's honor. But when the
donors leav~ the medical school,
they are not put back together. -
They are not given a funeral
service, their family members are
not afforded one last gaze, and
they are not buried. Instead, they
are cremated and their ashes
placed with those of other
donors. Though the practice of
anatomy has come a long way,
the destination of those who give
their bodies to medicine is still a
far cry from what most prefer to
imagine as our final resting place.
