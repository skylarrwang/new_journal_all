In the beige glow of an 
operating room at Yale-
New Haven Hospital, doctors lean over the body of 
Ken .Welch, a 61 year-old 
New Haven resident with 
colon cancer. Nurses, anesthesiologists, and assistants are present, aides 
to the invasive procedure. Among them is 
Claire Bessinger; and although she is not a 
medical practitioner, like the surgeons she is 
here to heal. The patient cannot speak for 
himself now, but before the surgery was 
scheduled, he asked Claire 
his Reiki 
Master 
to be present from pre-op to recovery 
room. For her, it is an awesome privilege: 
During the surgery, she performs Reiki on 
Ken, using touch to harness the natural energy 
of his body, so that it might respond more 
positively to this trauma and heal. At one 
point, the surgeon turns to Claire and asks: 
"Claire, would you please tell everyone here 
what it is you're doing and how it helps." 
Claire is using her fingers. The surgeons are 
using forceps. In this one small operating 
room, East meets West. 

It is speculated that the Reiki technique 
originated in the distant traditions of 
Buddhist, Tibetan, and perhaps even Christian 
monks, who used soft touch and massage to 
relax and heal the body with its own natural 
energies. A Japanese term for spiritually guided 
life and universal force energy, Reiki was 
conceived in its modern form by Dr. Mikao 
Usui. His .Usui System of Natural Healing 
outlines a series of tenets for the practice of 
Reiki based on a mystical experience he had 
on Mount Karuma in 1914. Today, it's practiced 
at Yale-New Haven in a fledgling program that 
may change the way the hospital 
relates to its patients. 


HAVING REIKI DURING HIS SURGERY WAS AN 
obvious choice for Ken. As one of Claire's disciples, 
he experienced the power of Reiki during training 
sessions. He had practiced it on 
his wife 
improving her knees, reducing her 
headaches, relieving her aches, and putting her 
to sleep. Last February, when Ken 
had a colon resection at Yale-New 
Haven, the doctor, he says, was not 
his only "advocate." Claire was by 
his side from the moment he arrived 
at the hospital. "I was not anxious 
once Claire got started. I felt more 
confident that things would go 
right 
there was a sense that my 
body would be less traumatized and it 
certainly reduced my stress," he 
recalls ten months later. 

Though he cannot definitively say 
that the duration of his hospital stay 
was shorter because of Reiki, Ken 
strongly believes "Reiki played a role 
in the speeding up of the healing. 
Yes, the Reiki has an effect on the 
body." In spite of the skepticism it 
inspires, who can say Ken's triumph 
is not due to the contribution of 
Reiki? "People look at me and say 
'you look great.' I have a sense that 
it's all behind me and I have thirty or 
forty years ahead of me." 

Reiki, as conceptualized by Dr. 
Usui, was intuitive 
it was, after all, 
based on a mystical experience. But 
after its arrival in the United States, 
the healing methodology became 
more structured. Today, Reiki has 
been lumped together with other 
Complementary 
Alternative 
Medicine (CAM) therapies, such as 
aromatherapy and herbal baths. 
None of these therapies is ailment 
specific, which is why I've tried them; 
they are general medical practices 
that promote relaxation and relief. 
Call me a Zen seeker, trendy, or Type 
A, but I have been known to seek out 
treatments that promise this kind of 
healing. So though I have never needed 
them to cure illness, having healing 
hands on my body is something 
I've grown used to. Reiki, however, 
was new to me, and, like all choosy 
consumers, I was skeptical. I had 
never tried acupuncture or hypnosis, 
and Reiki seemed closer to these less-
mainstream, but potentially more 
powerful therapies. Burdened with 
preconceptions, I set off to determine 
if it was the answer to my quest 
for calm. Theoretically, anyone will 
benefit from Reiki 
even me. Ken 
certainly believed in its power. Maybe 
I could too.

stream in the past two decades. But 
there is a wider context for the prevalence 
of the CAM industry rooted in its 
tenuous relationship with Western 
medicine and the evolution of that rela-
tionship over time. People have been 
using Chinese herbs for centuries. But 
recently, with the health care industry, 
and specifically pharmaceutical compa-
nies, driving costs up, CAM therapies 
have become a popular alternative to 
expensive traditional medicine. The 
bottom line is that, at least psychologically, 
you will feel better after one 
affordable hour spent with an acupuncturist 
than you would after ten pricey 
minutes spent with an internist. On the 
one hand, CAM therapies are seeking a 
marriage with Western medicine. On 
another, they are seeking a divorce. 


THE 
EUS CENTER FOR HEALTH 
and Healing where Amanda Wilson 
works is a scene that aligns closely with 
stereotypes of alternative therapy. 
Inside the small cottage-turned-wellness 
center, shelf upon shelf is weighed 
down by herbs, vitamins, potions, 
creams, salves, oils, and pills: diabetes 
control, diet formula, diet support, 
muscle-joint support, digestive system, 
allergy and sinus, cold and flu relief, 
immune builders, mood support, 
Chinese herbs. Welsh musician Enya's 
"Smooth Operator" lulls in the background. 
I look up at the "Evergain Chi 
Machine." It is on sale for $249 
a 
hundred dollar discount. Too bad I 
don't know what it does. 

Centers like Amadeus, though perhaps 
not as pretty, have cropped up 
throughout the Elm City, responding to 
a need and reacting to a trend. On a 
simple level, wellness centers are havens 
from the rigors of the everyday world, 
luring stressed-out seekers like me. 
They also cater to the popularity of 
"alternative," organic, and holistic 
lifestyles that have become more mainstream 
in the past two decades. 

Though she was raised in the 
Methodist Church 
her father was a 
pastor Amanda has found a new 
source of spiritual strength in Reiki. 
It's not necessarily religious, but there 
is an otherworldly component. "The 
great thing about Reiki and giving 
Reiki is that you're always receiving as 
you're giving," she said. "So the energy 
works through me as well as 
through the client. So I'm being 
healed as I'm healing." 

Amanda leads me into a candle-
lit room permeated by the scent of 
burnt sage and the harmonies of a 
"Reiki CD," which she pops into an 
unobtrusive stereo. I take off my 
shoes and slide onto the treatment 
table. She covers me with a blanket, 
and I stifle a giggle. This is my first 
Reiki treatment, and I am determined 
to take it seriously. I try to relax my 
smile and let myself be taken in by the 
walls of the tiny treatment room. It 
takes a few moments. I never seem to 
feel anxious being worked on by the 
hands of an unfamiliar massage therapist. 
But lying in the dim pink light, I 
am not only fully clothed, but covered. 
It is the anticipation of the unknown 
that wrestles my mind. 

Eyes closed, Amanda works down 
my chakras, sacred centers of my
