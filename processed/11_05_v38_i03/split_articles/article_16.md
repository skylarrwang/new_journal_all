''EVERYONE DREAMS OF BEING 
IN A 
place like Battell," says Bill Grenawitzke, 
sipping from a bottle of seltzer after 
offering it to his fiancee, Ashley Green. 
"Especially Ashley," he adds, prompting a 
sharp look from her. ''What?" he says 
sheepishly. ''You've been really gung-ho 
about it." Given the importance of 
Battell 
both to this couple and to Yale 
as a whole 
no one could blame her.


Battell is a house of God amidst fresh-
man housing: It sits on the corner of Old 
Campus, between Durfee's Convenience 
Store, home of the $6 bag of Fritos, and 
Farnam Hall, home of the only washing 
machines ever available on Old Campus .


The chapel dates back to 187 4 and, even 
on a campus overrun with historic archi-
tecture, it stands out as especially gor-
geous. ''To be a part of that history is 
quite an honor," says Bill.


As Gale Iannone, Facilities Director for 
the Office of the Chaplain, says, ''Battell 
has a very intimate feel about it. The 
events unfold right around you." Though 
its high ceiling, booming organ, and 
imposing history channel that which is 
most intimidating and spectacular about 
Yale, Battell remains a personal site. Its 
pews have seated myriad patrons 
from 
some of . America's greatest thinkers to 
guests at bar mitzvahs. It is a site of wor-
ship adjacent to sites of late-night cram-
ming and a capella rehersals. It is a place 
where personal histories somehow live 
peaceably alongside history.


Last year, Battell hosted 1,391- events, 
about thirty of which were wedclit.i.gs. The 
Chaplain's Office first officially recorded 
marriages in Battell in 1960, but there 
were most likely many marriages before 
then, according to Iannone. Today, to 
walk down Bartell's aisle, couples must 
register a year in advance. However, the 
process is nothing like the rigid standards 
enforced by the Stanford University 
chapel, which requires couples to fill out 
compatibility tests. Despite Battell's Yale 
heritage, only one in three of the couples 
who marry there have any previous con-
nection with the University.


David Williams and Priya Raman, an 
undergraduate couple engaged to be mar-
ried, can explain why, for them, Battell is 
out of the question. First, it's a matter of 
practicality 
David hails from California, 
and Priya is from Arizona, putting 
Connecticut far off the map of conven-
ient locations. But equally important is the 
fact that Battell is a little too Yale. ''I asso-
ciate Yale with college," Priya says, "which 
is a distinct period I love Yale, but when I 
graduate, that'll be it."


David and Priya began dating in 
September 2004, the fall of their freshman 
year. Before long, they started talking 
about life after Yale and the possibility of 
sharing it together. In.January 2005 they 
decided to get married. ''Either people are 
really happy for you;' says Priya, "or they 
don't know how to deal with it." Some of 
David's friends, he says, still don't know he 
is engaged to be married. Their plans for 
the future are far from definite; at the age 
of 19, there's no rush. David is still chaos-
ing a major. They don't know where they 
will be living and working after grad11ation, 
or where and when they'll get married. Yet 
they have already considered what a Battell 
wedding could mean and, even at this 
point, they know it is not for them.


For Bill, a PhD student in geology, and 
Ashley, who received her Master's degree 
from Yale in Computer Science, the case 
for Battell is compelling. They met as grad 
students in September 2003 on the walk 
over. to Convocation at Battell Chapel. 
They became friends and started dating a 
few months later. Next July, they will walk 
out of the place in which they met as hus-
band and wife. Bill appreciates what Battell 
means to his relationship: "We met here:-
that means a lot to us. It's the one thing 
that brought us· together."


For Bill, a Texas native, and Ashley, of 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, New Haven is a 
neutral site for their families to travel to. 
But Battell is more than that, says Ashley: 
''It's our common ground." Their wed-
ding, the ultimate gesture of togetherness, 
will be held at the place that brought them 
together to begin with.


Bill and Ashley hope their wedding day 
will recreate that experience for others:-
but with an end-of-ceremony surprise. 
''You can enter from the outside of Yale," 
Ashley says, ''but empty out into the court-
yard. That's our plan, to have people dump 
out into the courtyard after the ceremony, 
to have champagne and get tanked."
