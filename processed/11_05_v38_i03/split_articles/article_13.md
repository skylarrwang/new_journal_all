YOU'VE BEEN THERE. WAITING AT THE 
interminable light on Broadway and 
York, chatting on your cell phone with a 
friend who's sitting somewhere secluded 
and quiet—and then it begins. 

Distant, buzzing strains at first, then a 
mounting screech leading to a series of 
wails and a shrieking vehicle hurtling 
through your long-awaited walk light. 
Once the throbbing in your ears seems to 
have ended, you shatter the newly 
settled quiet with a shout: "WHAT WERE 
YOU SAYING?" Embarrassed by your 
lack of volume control, you glance 
around and proffer a quick explanation: 
"Sorry ... it's New Haven!" 

As a Los Angeles native, rumors 
alleging New Haven was a hotbed of 
crime never fazed me. What I was not 
prepared for, however, was the never-

arrived, walking to class was an 
overwhelming experience. Already 
frazzled by the crush of bodies, I seemed

fire engines barreling through 
crosswalks. I was shocked to discover 
that when a siren sounds, not only do 
drivers feel no pressure to pull over (or

signs of a vital emergency. No need to 
let a blaring fire truck impede your dash 
across Elm Street to grab lunch as a 
Berkeley transfer. 

"Yeah, nobody here even notices the 
sirens anymore," says Sergeant Burgh, a 
sturdy man casually perusing The 
National Enquirer behind the main desk 
at the police station. "It'd be good to 
ticket them, but when you're in your 
squad car with the siren going"—his eyes 
drift from the tabloid as he describes 
the experience—"getting closer and 
closer to the crime scene, you just get so 
... so jacked-up, you know? And it's not 
like you're really gonna stop for a minute 
to ticket some jerk who didn't pull over. 
It's like a, you know, a..." 

"Catch 22?" I suggest. 

"Yeah, one of those," he says, returning 
to his magazine. "People say there are a 
lot more sirens here than in other 
places," he remarks, flipping to a story 
about Britney Spears. "I would say
