SI'EPHEN l<Eu.ERT HAS A VERY COMPUCA1'ED-
sounding job. He is a Professor of Social 
· Ecology at the School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies and a member of 
the Executive Committee of the Yale 
Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics. 
He works in what is c"aned "environmen-
tal ethics" and recently he has spent 
much of his time thinking about "bio-
philia," an idea he helped develop, which 
hypothesizes that the love of nature is 
an evolutionary development. This love 
might even be selfish: A cure for cancer, 
Kellert points out, is more likely to be 
found in a world with many plant and 
animal species. "There are values to be 
derived," he says, "from a healthy and 
diverse natural environment."


This last statement could be the 
mottq of the Center that helps sup-
port his work. Housed in a small build-
ing, tucked away on Prospect Street 
behind the Institution for Social and 
Policies Studies, of which it forms a 
wing, the Center is a healthy environ-
ment for the diverse array of scholars 
who pass through.


As the name proclaims, it is very 
much an interdisciplinary center. "It's 
hard to think of a field that's more 
interdisciplinary," 
says 
Professor 
Margaret Farley, one of the Center's . 
two directors. The Bioethics Course . 
List, a diverse ftle of all Yale courses 
relating to bioethics, is fifty pages long, · 
drawing from most undergraduate 
departments and many professional 
schools. Paging through Bioethics · at 
Yale, . the Center's annual publication 
(some 270 pages this year), it is easy to 
forget which discipline you are reading 
about. Professor Willard Miranker of 
the Computer Science department 
worries about the "grave ethical chal-
lenges" humans 
will 
face when 
machines 
"become 
sentient." 


Professor Robert A. Burt of the Law 
School. is concerned with "the . experi-
ence and culture of dying in America." 
Rajesh Rao, a medical student, has co-
founded the Yale Stem Cell Interest 
Group "to discuss the biological, ther-
apeutic, ethical, social, and religious 
implications of stem cells."


In no other book could one turn 
the page from a proftle of Ian Shapiro, 
Professor of Political Science ("In the 
area of bioethics, I have written about 
abortion policy, euthanasia, and the 
distribution of health care ... "), to a 
proftle of John Ohno, High School 
Junior ("I'm interested in computers, 
prograrnming, robotics, and anime .. :I 
atn also a member of the 'Technology 
and Ethics' working group").


All these people-and hundreds 
more 
are united by a word that didn't 
even 
exist a 
few 
decades 
ago. 
According to the Oxford English 
Dictionary, the birth of the term 
"bioethics" occurred in 1971. That 
year was a time of "large scale ques-
tioning about the nature of moral 
authority in our society," says Susan 
Lederer, a science historian affiliated 
with the Center. "There was distrust 
that physicians could be left to make 
responsible decisions on everything 
from test-tube babies to the definiton 
of death."


It wasn't until the mid-80s that any-
one at Yale even attempted to organize 
and bring together people working in 
bioethics. It was then that Dr. Edmund 
Pellegrino 
first 
convened 
the 
"Humanities in Medicine" group. 
Professors from all departments and 
professional schools came to speak 
about their work. "We spent a year and 
a half just educating each other on 
what we had been doing," says Dr. 
Robert Levine, now a director of the 
Center. ''And just when we were fin-
ished, Ed Pellegrino went to become 
the president of Catholic University."


The group dissolved, and for the next 
decade, professors at Yale pursued 
bioethics individually, without any 
coordination of their efforts. When 
Donald Green, director of ISJ>S, sug-
gested creating a Bioethics ~roject at 
Yale, Dr. Levine told him not to both-
er . it wouldn't work. "Fortunately fie 
didn't listen to me 
and it worked.'-'-


The "Project" was only this past 
year promoted to a "Center" 
and 
"The University does not convey 
'Center' status lightly," reads the fore-
word to Bioethics at Yale. The Center 
has shown results: Its 14 research 
groups produce papers and sometitnes 
books, and its conferences can draw 
audiences of two hundred. Dr. Levine 
estimates that about a fifth of all 
Divinity 
Students 
Medical 
Students pass through its doors. The 
undergraduate bioethics course taught 
two years ago attracted a record-break-
ing 500 students. "It worked" indeed-
the small house on Prospect is now a 
hub linking activities at the remotest 
corners of Yale's campus.


And . in another corner, at the 
Forestry School atop Science Hill, 
Professor Stephen Kellett is planning 
a major symposium on biophilia.-
specifically, on the principle of "bio-
philic design." The idea, he explains, is 
that '<human physical and mental well-
being can be enhanced by a.built envi-
ronment that lets you experience 
nature." Some of our most honored 
feats of human construction, he feels,
