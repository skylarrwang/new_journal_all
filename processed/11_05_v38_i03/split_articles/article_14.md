only two per cent of those are us, 
though. The rest are the medical people 
or the fire department, mostly. The fire 
guys are required to set the sirens going 
for every barbecue-fire call they get."


"It's the way Yale is set up, why there 
are so many sirens around there," 
Sergeant Burgh continues. Fumbling 
around for a piece of scratch paper, he 
explains that Yale's campus is the most 
siren-ridden place in New Haven. He 
sketches a quick diagram of the streets 
around campus, pointing out the fire sta-
tion and hospitals that make . it a siren 
epicenter. The main fire headquarters sits 
at the end of Elm Street, only four 
blocks east of campus. Yale-New Haven 
Hospital hems the . school in just south 
on York Street, and The Hospital of 
Saint Raphael is located seven blocks 
west of campus on Chapel Street. 
Nestled between these three facilities, 
Yale's campus is an emergency vehicle 
crossroads, with fire trucks racing 
through to the city's west and amb~­
lances pummeling northward on York 
Street. Sergeant Burgh also has an imagi-
native theory as to the way the sirens 
echo off the Gothic architecture 
creat-
ing,.as he explains, a tunnel of sound. 
The theory's scientific basis seems shaky, 
but I can attest to walking through that 
tunnel several times each day. 


A chat with the Fire Marshall shed 
statistical light on my observations. An 
average of 92 911 calls are received in 
the call .center in the basement of the 
New Haven Courtho-qse each day. 
Usually, only about ten of these calls 
involve ·actual flames; these are passed 
along to the fire department, while the 
other 82 are answered by ambulances. 
That's. 92 sirens·each day indiscriminately 
passing through the "tunnel of sound." 


Siu ing outside Au Bon Pain recently, 
I was talking to my' dad on the phone, 
when suddenly he asked me to repeat 
myself he hadn't heard "because of the 
damn siren." Siren? I thought. I hadn't 
noticed; I'd just shouted over it. After all, 
it was merely one of 92 that would greet 
my ever-adjusting ears that day.
