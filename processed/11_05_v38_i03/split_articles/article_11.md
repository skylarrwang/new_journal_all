ry, is now a congregation of com-
muters. The membership's slow 
exodus from the Dixwell neighbor-
hood, spanning half a century, mirrors 
middle-class migration out of inner 
cities across America. But at Dixwell 
Church, the pattern may soon be 
interrupted. Reverend John Henry Scott 
III is charting a new course for the 
church's future. Now in his tenth year 
as Dixwell's pastor, Reverend Scott has 
drawn over a dozen newcomers to the 
church this year alone. For an aging 
congregation of about two hundred, 
that is a sizable increase. In large part, 
Reverend Scott attracts members 
through his bimonthly talks on 
financial management and occasional 
seminars on topics like how to start a 
small business. Reverend Scott, also a 
professor of business at Gateway 
Community College, is adapting Dixwell 
Church to a new era and a new Dixwell 
community. But the proud steward of 
his church's long history claims his 
mission is really nothing new at all. 

When Simeon Jocelyn, a white 21-year-
old from a prominent local family, 
helped 24 former slaves found the 
Dixwell Church in 1820, their quest for 
autonomy and racial equality in New 
Haven was nothing short of 
revolutionary. A retrospective from the 
church's centennial recalls that its first 
home, a small frame church on Temple 
Street, "was stoned repeatedly during 
services." Founder Jocelyn was 
threatened so often he needed 
bodyguards and eventually fled New 
Haven altogether. 

At Jocelyn's departure, the church was 
exclusively black. Throughout the 1800s, 
some of the most vocal abolitionists and 
suffragists in the black community were 
drawn from its ranks. Before local 
public schools were desegregated, the 
founders of New Haven's first school for 
black children also came from Dixwell 
Church. 

By 1900, New Haven had several other 
black churches. But Dixwell Church, 
relocated to 100 Dixwell Avenue after a 
group of Russian Jews bought its Temple 
Street building in 1887, had already 
established a reputation as the religious 
home for the city's black elite. 

In 1924, the church donated land for 
the founding of the Dixwell Community 
House—known later as the Q House—a 
staple of the Dixwell community into 
the twenty-first century. Natalie Hardy, a 
77-year veteran of Sundays at the 
Dixwell Church, remembers those days 
as a different era along Dixwell. Many 
of the city's black professionals lived 
near her house at 62 Dixwell: Her own 
father was a lawyer, and their neighbors 
were doctors and dentists. With only a 
handful of black churches in the city, 
Dixwell faced little competition for 
congregants. By the 1960s, it had 400 
members. 

The community's transformation began 
in the early 1940s, when a low-income 
housing project was built in the area. The 
campaign was intended to be one of 
urban renewal, but Dixwell would never 
be the same. "People moved out, some 
of whom expected to move back, but in 
some cases that didn't happen," Hardy 
recalled. Her family stayed in Dixwell, 
but its church was increasingly 
comprised of commuters from Hamden, 
Bethany and other neighboring towns. In 
the 1960s, the church co-sponsored the 
construction of a low-income housing 
unit of its own, Florence Virtue Homes 
Inc., which drew the neighborhood's 
first white residents. Of those who moved 
in, some remain church members. But 
low-income housing had a dual effect on 
the church. By 1967, only a quarter of 
its congregants lived within walking 
distance. In 1969, when the church 
moved to its present home at 214 
Dixwell, its collaboration with the Q 
House tapered off, severing one of its 
strongest neighborhood ties. 

But the reverend is eager for his church 
to shed its out-of-towners image. In the 
last year, he has mailed out hundreds of 
postcards inviting church neighbors to 
its services, and he has overseen the 
installment of a new roof; new speakers, 
bathrooms, and carpets; and a fresh 
coat of paint in the church sanctuary, all 
in the hopes of welcoming new 
parishioners. He doesn't want the church 
to lose its homey feel but he also 
doesn't want it to cede its history of 
activism to the comforts of middle-class 
suburbia. 

On a recent Sunday, the reverend, 
ebullient and fresh-faced, knew all his 
congregants by name. He knew who had 
surgery last week, and who recently 
lost a son. When the service began, his 
greetings rang out from the pulpit along 
with the sermon. To a lady in the back: 
"I know you've been under the weather. 
Good to see you!" To a family in the 
front: "You haven't been here in a few 
weeks. Glad to have you back!" 

But the bulk of the sermon was reserved 
for talk of the world outside the cement 
star. "Here at Dixwell Church, we have a 
special responsibility—the same 
responsibility that Simeon Jocelyn and 24 
former slaves felt all those years ago," he 
told the congregation. "Middle-class 
folks like us," he added, "have no less of 
an imperative to fight for social justice—
for racial equality, improved housing, 
better education and better health care; 
for the haves as well as the have-nots. 
"That's your mission as a Dixwellite!" he 
bellowed. 

From the front row, Hardy nodded in 
approval. Her granddaughter recently 
joined the church, one in a spate of new 
members. Hardy now drives past over 16 
churches on her way down Dixwell 
Avenue each Sunday. But she has never 
thought of leaving: "That's my church. I've 
never considered any other church being 
my church than Dixwell," she explained 
defensively. "The city changed a lot, but 
we kept going."
