WARD 1 ALDERMAN NICK SHALEK'S 
anti-union stance would probably have 
made him totally unelectable thirty years 
ago. Picture the political climate of the 
time at its peak on May 1, 1970: Over 
15,000 people converged on the New 
Haven Green, the "largest assoru nent of 
long-haired youths, film crews, and 
National Guardsmen that New Haven 
has ever seen" reported the Yale Daify 
News the following day. Protesting the 
murder trial of three Black Panthers, they 
listened to speakers, snake-danced to 
chants of "Free Bobby Seale," the name 
of one of the Panthers on trial, and 
eventually clashed with police in a violent 
eruption of rocks and tear gas.


Looking back, between the culturally 
defiant youths, the radical speakers, and 
the seeming intractability of police-pro-
tester relations, this scene seems like a 
caricature of the era. It epitomizes a 
polarized America, a cliched conflict of 
aggressive authority using old tactics to 
respond to rebellious liberalism.


And yet, Yale University handled the 
May Day protests of 1970, and the stu-
dent strikes leading up to it, with a sur-
prisingly liberal approach. President 
Kingman Brewster decided to end the 
school year prematurely in response to 
the strike, and managed the throngs of 
protesters by opening residential college 
gates, housing them in courtyards, and 
feeding them in dining halls. -It was a 
"policy of shutting down to 3pen up," 
remembers 
Sarah 
Shapiro 
'72_


Recognizing that the protests could f!Ot 
be contained, Brewster postponed aca-
demic deadlines and expanded the 
option to take classes pass/ fail. William 
Farley '72 LAW '77, then-chairman of 
the Strike Steering Committee explained, 
"As long as people went along with their 
daily lives, things would not be confront-
ed and faced. The only way to get things 
confronted and faced was to stop normal 
activity and to concentrate on what was 
going on around us."


Today, the political atmosphere has 
changed radically. On August 27, 2003, 
Yale employees' Local Unions 34 and 35 
went on strike for better pensions. The 
surrounding turmoil was undeniably 
smaller in magnitude than that of the 
Bobby Seale triaL The strike was a dis-
agreement over the terms of a contract, 
and there was certainly less consensus on 
the issues. Yet, if the conflict between 
Yale and its labor unions was compara-
tively small, and the issues less signifi-
cant, the Yale community's effort to stifle 
the conflict stands out. Personal prefer-
ence replaced political ideology: Every 
part of the Yale community endeavored 
to take politics out of the equation.


This political apathy extended to even 
the highest levels of the administration. 
Amidst the May Day protests of the 
1970s, President Brewster had famously 
articulated the political nature of the 
trial, declaring, "I am skeptical of the 
ability of black revolutionaries to achieve 
a fair trial anywhere in the United States. 
In large part, the attnosphere has been 
created by police actions and prosecu-
tions against the Panthers." In 2003, 
President Levin did the opposite: When 
protesters were arrested for allegedly 
refusing police orders and blocking traf-
fic on separate occasions during union 
demonstrations, President Levin said it 
was a matter for the court and prosecu-
tors to work out.


During the 2003 demonstrations, Yale 
refused to let political protests disrupt 
normal school functions 
even if that 
meant marching riot police into its 
investment 路offices or harassing students 
wearing signs of political .protest.


The Yale adminisfration was not alone 
in its desirf 't<? -: co~tain the politically 
volatile nature ~ gf:;:'the strikes. Student 
reactions coUld路 路h.ar'ffiy be characterized 
as radically political, or 路 even political. 
Pundits-in-training rushed to the opinion 
pages of the Yale Daijy News to express 
their "respect" for the unions while avoid-
ing discussion of the issues. Others insist-
ed that the sttikes distracted students from 
their "purpose" on campus. When two 
politically-opposed 
professors 
co-
authored an opinion piece, they Withheld 
their differing views on the issues. and 
instead offered a purportedly objective 
solution to the political conflict: simply let 
a "neutral" third party evaluate the case 
and rule 
not on who is right on the 
issues, but who is more "reasonable"


By the end of the conflict, good com-
munity sentiments were the new political 
fad. The Yale College Council held 
events for Yale workers and students to 
mingle in ccsocial settings." YCC repre-
sentative Daniel Weeks '06 told reporters 
in 2003 that the council's aim was not to 
endorse the strikes or the union, but sim-
ply to ''build a stronger comtnunity in 
non-political ways."


The YCC also 
offered to distribute one hundred JEOP-
ARDY! tickets to union employees. As 
President Levin put it, ''I think it's a very 
nice gesture to help rebuild a good feel-
ing in our community."


Politics were quickly forgotten in the 
mad rush to kiss and make up. Perhaps it 
was because Yale's labor troubles were 
more complex, less polarized, and 
aroused less student interest than Bobby 
Seale's murder trial. Perhaps enough 
progress has been accomplished to ren-
der radical change to Yale's political 
atmosphere unappealing. Yet, as the 
recent Ward 1 election shows, conflicts 
about unionism still lurk beneath the sur-
face of student politics.


In previous elections, challengers to 
the Democratic nominee were repeated-
ly defeated because those who cared 
enough to vote resoundingly favored 
the more liberal candidate .. Perhaps 
Nick 
Shalek 
defeated 
Rebecca 
Livengood because the people who 
voted were more ambivalent about 
unions. In 1970, ambivalence would not 
have carried the day.
