An Artspace gallery introduces unlikely artists to the public. 

YALE SCHOOL OF ART GRAD CHRIS 
Engstrom swims around his New 
Haven apartment, preparing to 
screen his short animated film, "Sea 
Net," for a dozen strangers. They 
mill around his home-studio with a 
combination of art-museum won-
der and open-house voyeurism, 
glancing from paintings into an 
adjoining kitchen (where a real, live 
artist breaks his daily bread), and 
surreptitiously back again. 

The film features line-drawings 
of a small boy struggling to gather 
all of the beach's 
shells and 
starfish 
into his "sea net," to take 
back to his studio (where else?) for 
inspiration. "That's a problem of 
mine," a bubbly Engstrom admits to 
his audience. "Having to select the 
most important thing. I want to 
push it all in there." 

As the trespassers tramp out of 
his apartment at Art Lofts West, an 
affordable housing complex for 
working 
artists 
in 
Westville, 
Engstrom's temptation becomes 
mine: There is too much to take 
away as we make for the next stop 
on the "Neighborhoods" studios 
tour. The tour is the second install-
ment of the annual City-Wide Open 
Studios event. Over three weeks, 
local Artspace showrooms will 
introduce New Haven's arts com-
munity and its public to each other. 
On this tour, in this town, it 
becomes increasingly clear that 
there are too many artists to do 
them all justice—what is the most 
important thing? 

On the tour there is a small elder-
ly woman dressed from head to toe in 
every shade of purple, with the 
exception of the giant sunflower 
pinned to the top of her floppy 
lavender hat. It becomes my bobbing 
yellow beacon as we wander among 
the numerous studios. 
"Where are we, and what is this 
place?" she asks me. Her name is 
Matty Dagradi. Together with a 
young, ponytailed high-school art 
teacher named Noah, we are remov-
ing our shoes in the foyer of some-
one's Sherman Avenue home; filing 
by a woman I recognize as a Yale 
professor, who refuses to go sock-
footed ("It's fine among friends, but 
in the house of a stranger!"); climb-
ing stairs past dynastic African 
sculptures to the incense-scented 
studio of a former Hillhouse High 
School football player who recently 
quit his job to become a "full-time 
artist." Noah corners him genially in 
the kitchen and proposes a meeting 
with his class—a group of recalci-
trant students he's "having a hard 
time getting to realize that people in 
their own neighborhoods" make art. 

Matty pokes covetously around 
each new studio. "I have half a 
garage to paint in," she laments—so 
she is an artist too! Oh, she takes a 
drawing 
class at 
Southern 
Connecticut State—that's free for 
seniors, but what really gets her 
going is talking about "the vitality 
of young artists" and how "it's a 
different generation now." After 
studying 
advertising 
design 
at 
Brooklyn's renowned Pratt Institute, 
Matty stayed home to raise her 
kids—all five of whom are now 
what could be called "full-time 
artists": a painter, a photographer, a 
jazz musician, an architect, a docu-
mentarian. Imbuing them all with 
that "most important thing," Matty 
Dagradi has sculpted an entire fam-
ily of artists. I wonder if she would 
adopt me. But am I an artist? 

Noah, who takes welding class-
es at the local Creative Arts 
Workshop and will display one of 
his works at Open Studios' closing 
exhibition, Alternative Space, the 
following weekend, is an artist. He 
moved here two months ago from 
Minneapolis, which he says has an 
impressive art scene "for being 
where it is in the Midwest." It 
buzzes with just the right mix of 
large galleries and small community 
venues. Similarly, he says, New 
Haven "has more opportunities 
than you would expect to find for a 
city of its size." 

According to Artspace's communi-
cations director Leslie Kuo, New 
Haven has the "concentration of 
artists" necessary to support an event 
like Open Studios. This year, some 
500 creative minds participated in 
"one of the premier" events of its 
kind across the country. Kuo cites the 
public exposure that Open Studios 
has offered for the past eight years as 
the key to its success. "It's a self-fulfill-
ing prophecy," she says, fierce with 
pride. "Artists leave New York to 
come here." By luring new artists, 
Open Studios feeds itself. 

And then there's Matty, at once 
audience and artist. Kuo explains 
that Open Studios helps people like 
her—"secret artists"—to "step over 
that line." "We've gotten artists 
[both] by importing them and by 
making them." 

One of the last stops our dank 
Yale-borrowed bus makes is the 
Loretta Staples studio. A former 
graphic design professor whom 
Kuo named as part of New York's 
art exodus, Staples stands before a 
set of 
scrolls 
decorated with 
abstract ink designs and tells us, 
"Everybody has their own way. You 
just need to find the way that's your 
way. You can give yourself permis-
sion to take yourself seriously and 
be an artist." 

Before we part, Matty and I prom-
ise to look for each other at 
Alternative Space the next weekend. 
She tells me I "have a nice, low-key 
way of doing things," and also to 
wash my hands when I get home. 

The following Saturday, I wander 
the massive old Olin Brass building on 
Shelton Avenue—filled for a weekend 
with five stories-worth of art, artists, 
and audience. I don't find Matty. I do 
find three shadowy photographs by 
her daughter, Terry Dagradi, and 
Noah's piece—a chunk of metal from 
an oil drum, carved into a jagged sun-
burst. The short caption reads: "I get 
pulled 
moving constantly out, but 
return to the center for more and 
more and more and more and more 
and more."
