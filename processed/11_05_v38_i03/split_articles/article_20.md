body that correlate to colors, feelings, 
and physical symptoms. These energy 
hot-spots are an important element 
of Reiki for Amanda. Sometitnes she 
touches me lightly, other ritn,es her 
hands hover a few inches away from 
my body, redistributing my energy. I 
feel force and heat. "I'm just a con-
duit," she says softly. 

Time passes, and Amanda quiet-
ly finishes her work. While I attempt 
to rouse my limbs from the slumber 
they have slipped into, Amanda 
begins to offer tne _her diagnosis-
what she felt and then dealt with dur-
ing my treatment. I'm surprised-
apparently, she has treated problems 
I did not know I had. She tells me I 
have an excess of energy in my 
throat center it is blue in color and 
is associated with one's ability to 
conununicate. That seems reason-
able. But, she says, there are block-
ages in my sacral center below the 
navel, and at my solar plexus. 
November 2005 

Blockages indicate a problem with 
the function associated with that 
chakra, like the throat and communi-
cation. The blockage in my sacral, 
Amanda tells me, may indicate tur-
moil in the way I relate to my fatnily 
and friends, and on a physical level, 
may be connected to menstrual 
stress. The solar plexus rela..tes to 
self-love, self-esteem, the color yel-
low, the number three, and digestion. 
My blockage means I am struggling 
with deficiencies or conflicts in these 
matters. I have an easy titne putting 
all the pieces together; her diagnosis 
does seem plausible. But I can't help 
but think that, like the prophecy of a 
fortuneteller 
shuffling 
through 
clients, her words are so general, they 
could apply to anyone. 

''There is probably a psychosomat-
ic component to all of this, but that's 
not a bad thing," says Amanda. The 
purple amethyst dangling from the pale 
skin of her neck sways to the sound of 
her melodious voice. Amanda came to 
Reiki by chance, art incident that helped 
her heal the wounds of a traumatic 
childhood. ''It is a divine energy that is 
brought through 
the practitioner 
through the hands and into the client. 
But it's believed that they don't even 
need to believe in the energy in order 
for it to work," she says compellingly, 
''because it's always working." 

Amanda· uses Rejki energy to heal 
the wounds of the everyday world. She 
had a client who was struggling to sell 
her New Haven home; Amanda did 
Reiki on the house in a meditative 
state, visualizing the house and drawing 
certain symbols in the air 
and it sold. 

When she is not at Amadeus, she sends 
-distance treatments to the healing cen-
ter in this satne way 
so that business 
will be sound. The power of Reiki helps 
her sister with adult ADD achieve a 
meditative state. '~S, Hiv, cancer, all 
kinds of different pain, emotional phys-

of the number one healing modality 
used," says Amanda passionately. ''It's 
helpful because it's not invasive and you 
can experience change· without feeling 
traumatic effects." 

Here, at my first 
Reiki session, I did experience change. I 
don't know if Amanda illuminated my 
wanting chakras with energy, but I did 
feel a sense of caltn. 
.. .LJ>A. HAD TOLD ME, 'cy OU CAN'T 
OD on Reiki,'' so that afternoon I drive 
across New Haven for more, without 
feeling like a junkie. For Claire 
Bessinger, Ken's Reiki Master, the sense 
of intuition and mysticism associated 
with Reiki is secondary: Its power and 
importance lies in its physicality and 
palpability. Claire does not have to tell 
me that. It is evident in the way she 
guides her hands to specific points on 
my body, as I lie on the · examination 
table in the quiet darkness with only the 
sound of Claire's bare feet pattering on 
the linoleum. I breathe deeply. This 
afternoon, I am completely at ease, 
though it was only several tninutes ago 
that this woman, now using her hands 
to generate heat in an area neat my 
breasts, greeted me for the first tirne. 

We meet in her office at 100 
Church Street, where she has worked 
at Yale Medical Publications for 17 
years. After a brief exchange, she 
leads me down several passageways 
into a harshly lit elevator. We are 
going to a quiet place, a room where 
she will give me a 35-minute Reiki 
treatment. She opens a door and 
reveals ten mock examination beds, 
with shiny instruments protruding 
like mangled limbs. It is a laboratory 
.where, two hours later, obstetrics 
gynecology students from UConn 
Medical School will rehearse exami-
nations and deliveries. Had I not 
experienced Reiki for the first ti rne 
earlier that morning, I would have 
thought I was in for the worst. 

Claire came to Reiki when she 
was training to be a volunteer at the 
Connecticut hospice in Branford in 
2000. In February 2001, she contin-
ued her training at a public and 
optional class offered at the Yale 
School of Nursing. After that class, 
Claire was Reiki "one and two," hav-
ing mastered the second of four lev-
els or attunements. "I said 'this is 
really great.' And I could go out and 
start using Reiki on my fa~y, my 
friends, my cats, whatever," s_~e. says. 
''And that's what I did." But a '¥ear 
later, Claire wanted to do more with,;· 
the new power she had tapped into. 
"During that year, some of the 
women I met in that class who were 
at the School of Nursing started to 
notice changes in me, just a different 
intensity in my life and a different 
focus, and I started to evolve into 
who I am now." 

If she had a second official posi-
tion at Yale, in addition to her role at 
Yale Medical Publications, Claire 
might be "Sterling Master of the Arts 
in Reiki." Claire is behind the Reiki at 
reading week's Wellness Program and 
other similar programs sponsored by 
the Hall of Graduate Studies and the 
Yale Health Plan. She is also an 
instructor for the program at Yale-
New Haven Hospital which sends vol-
unteer Reiki practitioners into the 
oncology clinic, cardiology, rehab, and 
the long-term medicine wards. Unlike 
Amanda's working conditions, at the 
hospital it is tnandatory that Reiki 
therapists touch their patients: "Reiki 
can be done above the bo_dy in the 
energy field. I don't teach that way; I 
wasn't taught that way," says. Claire 
matter-of-facdy. "No matter how a

practitioner was taught, we ask them to 
use touch. A hospital isn't going to be 
receptive of Reiki that doesn't involve 
touch or you go around waving your 
arms in the air doing things." 

In the 
hospital, Claire believes Reiki is an 
affirmation of the power of touch, an 
emotional association between the 
medical world and the patient: HFor a 
pa:tient in a hospital, if all you have is 
30 seconds to hold their hand, it's 
going t<? _ oe a powerful experience ... A 
patient who has a need is going to draw 
that energy iri ;t:P,at thirty seconds much 
faster." 

'lbirty~tiv"~· mjnutes Jater, in quiet 
repose on the examination table in the 
basement of 100 Church Street, I feel 
relaxed and warm not sleepy. Claire 
finishes quiedy and tells me to take my 
ttrne geu•ng up. 

"It's really allowing the person," she 
whispers, "I don't heal you. What 
Reiki does is allow you to heal yourself 
from within. It's not me 
I just bring 
lt to you. 

I lay motionless for a few minutes 
contemplating my status. I had a basis 
for comparison. And though the treat-
ments I received were different, I felt 
peaceful after both sessions 
an 
extreme state of relaxation that I had 
never experienced before, or at least 
not frequendy enough to identify it. 

CLAIRE PERCEIVES REIKI AS "BASIC 
simple energy work," and Amanda sees 
it as a '~ealing modality''; but to Sal 
Amadeo, Amanda's boss and the 
owner of Amadeus Center for Health 
and HeaHngJ and Amanda's boss, CAM 
therapy is a science and a business. 
When I ask hirn if he's a doctor, his 
answer is serious and brisk: "Oh yeah, 
ointment in a time 
zon. 

I'm definitely a doctor. People call me . 
·doctor all the time." Sal Amadeo prac-
tices energy medicine. But as obvious 
as his credentials may seem, watching 
hitn do a treatment forces one to admit 
that there is a methodology to his work 
that yields a very specific outcome. It 
may not be science as I know it, but it 
scientifically achieves its objectives. 

The word "doctor" can perhaps be 
used as a relative term: Sal is a doctor 
of the type of medicine he practices.-. 
an expert, an innovator, an authority 
Energy medicine is a synthesis of 
CAM therapies, incorporating Reiki, 
Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, 
acupuncture, alchemy, an herb called 
Moxa, Edgar Casey formulas, and 
never Jitniting itself to one. "It's the 
combination of tools I have in my 
toolbox that makes it unique," 
Sal 
says. "Doctors tell me this is real med-
icine ... It's a whole system." Sal knows 
· that what people like about energy 
medicine it is the fact that no two 
patients are treated alike. "If my medi-
cine were covered by insurance, it 
would be difficult for you to get an 
appointment in a tin1ely fashion," he 
says prophetically. His _opinion gets
