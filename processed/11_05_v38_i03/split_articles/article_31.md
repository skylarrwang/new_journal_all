stare at the hundreds of early 
editions of Leaves of Grass. 


Green spines and brown 
spines, all with gold-lettered 
titles rendered in plant-like 
tendrils, crowd the shelves for yards. I 
pull down one volume that includes 
Song of Myself, and find my favorite pas-
sage, section six: "A child said What is 
the grass? fetching it to me with full 
hands ..." Quietly at first, I begin to read 
aloud. Soon self-conscious, I pause to 
see if anyone is near enough to hear 
me. No one is; I am alone. I read more 
confidently through the 
end of the section. 


"And to die is different 
from what any one sup-
posed, and luckier." 


Since the fall of my 
freshman year, I have 
worked at Beinecke, 
the library that houses 
the most rare and valu-
able items in the Yale 
Collection. My job is to 
help Pat Willis and 
Nancy Kuhl curate exhibits for the 
Yale Collection 
of 
American 
Literature (YCAL). Curating means 
culling materials from the YCAL 
archives, which dwell in the basement, 
and crafting a narrative to tie those 
materials together. In the basement, 
however, there is no narrative: a frag-
ment of papyrus lies on a shelf not far 
from a fifteenth-century bible, and a 
box of nails from Thoreau's cabin is 
not much farther. Everything sits near 
others of their kind, yet the basement 
gives me the sense that the records of 
all mankind lie within a ten-foot radius 
of wherever I stand. 


Only Beinecke employees have 
access to this subterranean floor, which 
is reached by the elevator behind the 
Public Services desk on the concourse 
level. Since the library's ferocious secu-
rity policy mandates that not even an 
employee may take a floor plan of the 
archives outside the building, the base-
ment must be described instead of 
shown. Emerging from the elevator 
into one of four large chambers that 
take up most of underground Beinecke 
Plaza, nearly all I can see is white: white 
linoleum floors, white cement-block 
walls, the occasional white table stacked 
with white call slips. Most prominent 
are the sides of white shelves pressed 
together to form makeshift walls. White 
double-faced bookshelves pack togeth-
er on a floor track, shelves knocking 
against flanking shelves. Extra space lies 
between the end of a unit and the wall 
or a permanent pillar. To access a par-
ticular shelf, I rotate the handle at its 
end to roll it apart from its neighbors, 
creating just enough space for me and a 
box to slip by. Each chamber has sever-
al rows of units. To reinforce the steril-
ity of the interior design scheme, neon 
tube-bulbs on the ceiling provide cold, 
honest light. 


One of the chambers contains 
mostly books, while the other three 
contain everything that isn't a book: 
manuscripts, letters, maps, periodicals; 
photographs, microfilm reels, broad-
sides, papyri, music 
and lots of uncut sheets 
of playing 
cards. Other than 
grey boxes or, if the 
material is 
recently 
acquired, plain card-
board ones. Throughout 
the basement, amidst 
the white of the rooms 
and the grey 
and 
brown of the boxes, huge red fire 
extinguishers offer hints of color that 
seem less a relief than a slight threat. 
Also red are the little wall-mounted 
maintenance units that keep the 
atmosphere at 
seventy 
degrees 
Fahrenheit and fifty percent humidity. 
In the event of a fire, these units 
would emit halon gas, which depletes 
the oxygen supply just enough so that 
fire can't breathe but people still can. 


Off of the four main chambers stem 
a few small maintenance rooms. My 
favorite is the thirty-degrees below zero 
"Blast Freezer," to which all new acqui-
sitions are sent to be rid of worms, bac-
teria, and lice. 


I often get lost. After three years on 
the job, I can still be found wandering 
among boxes of playbills when I'm 
searching for a lantern slide; I scan 
Chinese book titles when what I want is 
a first edition of Moby Dick. Sometimes I 
am merely not where I am supposed to 
be. I might poke among the shelves of 
objects, greeting again the familiar bust 
of Thornton Wilder, the enormous 
African drum, the wooden marionettes, 
and the inexplicable collection of long-
necked ceramic cats. Sometimes I 
explore the books or boxes near the one 
I'm seeking—yesterday I was looking for 
a Tennyson manuscript and discovered a 
box marked "Alexander Pope Collection, 
Box 1 of 1." What choice had I but to 
pause and read a Pope letter kindly 
requesting that a fashionable lady pay up 
her debt? 


I am typically alone in the basement. 
Most employees descend only briefly, to 
secure a particular item for someone in 
the reading room. With no impatient 
scholar awaiting my ascent, I allow 
myself to linger. I feel anxious if another 
employee spots me delinquently 
unfolding a vest of Gertrude Stein's 
rather than dutifully replacing boxes with 
call slips. If I interact with another 
employee, our exchanges are short and 
awkward. "Excuse me" is the most fre-
quently uttered phrase, since I must nav-
igate around others with the wooden 
YCAL cart on which I place the loot I 
have pulled for an exhibition. 


Solitude allows me the rare chance to 
be entirely with my thoughts. In the whole 
world, I am the only one at this moment surrounded 
by papers written in Eugene O'Neill's 
cramped hand. Or, nobody knows I am hold-
ing and reading a letter from Melville to 
Hawthorne. Or even the obsessively liter-
al, I, 
Kopfly, am clutching a wooden 
tablet from the fourth century. I cannot read it. 
It is in Greek. No one knows these things. 


Occasionally, proprietary excitement 
yields to profound spiritual reaction. 
Sophomore year, I worked on an exhi-
bition of letters written by American 
writers. While crouched on the basement 
floor, poking around a low shelf of 
loosely organized YCAL boxes, I found 
a folder marked "Dickinson." I had 
searched the online database for "Emily 
Dickinson" and not found helpful 
results, so this folder startled me. 


Dickinson has long been a favorite writer 
of mine—one of those worshipped 
ones whose past physical existence 
seems somehow doubtful. I had hardly 
opened the box when four small, weight-
less sheets drifted onto my lap. I stared 
down at the slanted, widely spaced letter-
ing in faded pencil on grayish paper, dis-
cerning words with difficulty: 


(To the faithful 
Absence is condensed Presence. 
To others—
But there are no others.


I got chills. I felt heady. For the first time 
I worried that no one else was around—
what if I fainted? I did not. And since 
this poem was part of a letter, I included 
it in the exhibition. I forgot the call num-
ber, and now when I search "Emily 
Dickinson" on the database, I still can't 
find the letter. 


Sometimes I wonder about my easy 
access to all this material. What entitles 
me to read Zelda Fitzgerald's letters, with 
their sad evidence of her mental unravel-
ing? Why should I be allowed to sift 
through Annie Dillard's college note-
books, especially when she is still alive? 
What would Freud think of my analyz-
ing the epistolary psychoanalysis he sent 
to H.D.? I have not the justification of 
being an academic researcher, but then, 
is even this a justification? Actually, it is: 
these archives, and the exhibitions they 
feed into, deepen our understanding of 
history and art. Nevertheless, there is 
something a bit creepy and voyeuristic 
about my basement ventures. I must 
remind myself that most of the collec-
tions were given to the Beinecke with the 
artists' or their family's consent. Annie 
Dillard knows that scholars might be 
reading her college doodles and lists of 
crushes. She put them here. 


Outside the library, I often feel like a 
one-woman PR firm for Beinecke, urg-
ing my friends to attend the library-spon-
sored poetry readings, visit the exhibi-
tions, and request archives from the 
reading room. But what is most thrill-
ing to me about the Beinecke—the base-
ment—cannot be shared. I walk through 
the basement back to the elevator, hav-
ing fetched with full hands several acid-
free boxes. The condensed presence of 
hundreds of poets hovers in the air.
