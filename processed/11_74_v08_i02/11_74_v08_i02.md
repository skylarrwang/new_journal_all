**Title: Sweat sock circus**
**Author: Jon Etra**

The old A Y A coffee pot was a boil and percolating alumni. Imperialists of the meaningful expression had returned for another go, a quick alcoholic transumption with the past, a boisterous revel through foggy rooms, through Mory's, and the squashed muffins of brunch. They came for circuses and they got them-this was the 1974 alumni convocation and its topic was "Trends in Athletics." All these cheerful, maudlin relics made their own nostalgia in the cavern of Commons, their chance at the big time, three rings strong. ;

God only knows what brought them all here. It couldn't have been Brewster, certainly not the Association of Yale Alumni-and would you come to New Haven just to give money? And that trumped up topic of athletics was about as enticing as sweat sock stew. Maybe the invitation contained a dare-spend three days in this unspeakable town and we will give you whatever is behind the curtain. Maybe there were veiled threats to the family dog. For sure it was something crafty that only the most devilish of the Machiavels at Woodbridge Hall could devise: Come or we will burn your yearbook. The helpless hundreds came.

But of course they loved it. Smoking big cigars in public, opening heavy doors with assurance, glowering at menials, lurking about the gyro-superb! Finally a banquet at Woolsey hosted by the President and co-conspirators- bliss! Dinner as usual aboard the Titanic, the rich and beautiful awed and impressed by the sheer spectacle-the giant YALE banner, the cameras and lights, the obsequious servants in traditional livery. Not the slightest hint of chill in the air.

They heard the same tirades and pleas: they supplied the same attention and wild applause. Here we all are-Joy! Help us out (even though we blew it last time!). Bravo! Good old Yale- Hurrah! The dollars ring in. Somewhere a blue and white Jerry Lewis is watching the tote board climb. The cash wheels spin, only 300 million more, go, go, GO.' Look at us, we're walking!

Jon Etra wonders why the helpless hundreds came; Joyce Carol Oates warns of the dangers of literary criticism; John Ellis and Naomi Pierce hear Jane Fonda tell the same old tale.

I was asked why I write


The Yale of our brief and no doubt superficial experience is rather homogeneous; the atmosphere is intense, confined, analytical. I came away wondering if a remark made by a young woman during our Fiction Seminar might be representative, since it was incidental and went unchallenged-she alluded with contempt to a "mass" audience, a "mass market" population, as if there were hordes of unclean, brain-damaged barbarians swarming out in America, beyond the walls of Yale's colleges. I am not a political radical, but I am idealistic enough to believe that the basic philosophy of democracy is both intellectually and morally sound-and in any case, the implicit elitism and snobbery of such remarks are contrary to the'spirit of any "American studies" program. I said nothing at the time-I was rather shocked.

Not only was there the evidently unconscious assumption of the superiority of everyone in the seminar, or in the room, but the frank, complacent expression of this sentiment. If, as is quite probable, Yale's students have higher I.Q.'s than the "masses," this is to be attributed to heredity, good nutrition, and general affluence-to one's family's money, in short. No one need imagine himself or herself superior to the "masses"; we do not create ourselves, and even geniuses have no cause to feel pride.

Outside the formal seminar, I met innumerable people of natural, unstrained intelligence; inside the seminar, there was an emphasis upon artificial intellectualizing, the kind of Lit. crit. posturing that writers like Ionesco, Nabokov, Barth, Bellow, and many others (including, I suppose, myself) have always delighted in parodying. Criticism is a secondary activity: even the artist, when he is attempting criticism, realizes the Limitations of what he is doing. But it is easy to forget, to imagine that by juggling cliches and currently fashionable jargon, one has captured the essence of art. Where there is no natural sense of creativity, or no ability along such lines, there is often the illusion of superiority because one can "make judgments." Perhaps this goes along with the elitism I sensed.

One example will do: the critic assigns the writer a category. If the writer is morally involved with his society, he is called "didactic" and therefore inferior; if he is concerned mainly with art, he is Art-for-art's sake, and in danger of being rejected as a "dandy" (in Camus's sense of the word). So the critic achieves an illusory victory over the writer-but it is illusory, indeed.

I was also struck during the seminar by the inquiry of whether I was "bothered" that some students in the seminar believed my stories to be funny, and some did not-as if anyone with a sense of his own identity, whether a writer or not, could be presumed to be so easily swayed by the casual opinions of strangers. A conscious artist is, of course, open to opinions and judgments by individuals whose work he or she admires-people whose personalities or achievements indicate that their remarks should be taken seriously. But only a politician is anxious to please everyone, to conform to whatever attitudes a certain group seems to hold. I know this question was put to me innocently-but, like many remarks uttered in innocence, in near-unconsciousness, it reveals a great deal. Would it alarm you to be told that the emotions, moods, likes and dislikes, and various expressions of opinion of late adolescence are really not terribly important?

Along these lines, I also noticed (continued on page 15)

"It was a perfect oil spill," says Bill Hawley, a partner at Sea Land Environmental Engineering in Milford, Connecticut. " If there had to be a spill, it couldn't have gone better."

On Sunday, October 6, 100,000 gallons of black oil poured into New Haven harbor from the ruptured forward compartments of the 560 foot long S.S. Messinaki Bergen. More than half the spillage was contained by floating protective booms, and the oil that did escape before the ship reached its berth became the focus of an intensive 12·day clean-up operation.

The story received front page headlines in the New Haven newspapers for two days, and then the issue faded. An editorial in The New Haven Register two days after the spill briefly mentioned the general abuse of the nation's waterways, but focused on the facts of the local accident rather than their implications. The coverage was superficial.

Few traces of the spill remain-the oil is gone from the beaches, the heavy industrial traffic in the harbor continues, and S.S. Messinaki Bergen has left to carry another cargo. ·with the routine successfully restored, industry officials are congratulating themselves for their efficiency. while the public happily turns its concern away from the harbor. In the aftermath of a near-disaster has come relief rather than reflection.

A dozen things could have gone wrong. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Bergen was making a normal approach through the harbor's ship channel just after midnight Sunday morning when the crew felt a slight impact. Had the accident been worse, more of the ship's hull might have been ruptured. Had the ship grounded on the obstruction, a major rescue operation would have been required with tugboats pulling the tanker free as she continued to spew oil into the harbor. Also, the Coast Guard might have instructed the leaking ship to remain away from the shore. This safety precaution would have caused a far greater spill.

Instead, the Coast Guard told the ship's captain to proceed to the ship's berth at Wyatt, Inc., a local commercial oil distributor. Although a visual check from the vessel's stern did not reveal any leakage, Wyatt personnel prepared their emergency containment system-a floating plastic boom that traps any free oil on the water's surface inside the company's dock. When the ship arrived at the pier, a Wyatt crew immediately deployed the protective boom around the stern of the ship. The boom kept 60,000 gallons of oil from flowing across the harbor.

Forty thousand gallons had already escaped, but since the wind was light the spill did not spread far. Had it been anything other than a calm, warm night, the initial emergency measures and the subsequent clean-up would have proved much more difficult. Once the mishap had occurred, luck seemed to be playing a major role in its repair.

The clean-up began soon after the leaking Bergen reached the pier-the contained oil near the Wyatt dock was the first target. The crew used heavy-duty skimmers-wide-mouthed suction tubes submerged a few inches beneath the surface-to draw the oil into tank trucks, which were then emptied into Wyatt storage tanks.

An official from Exxon International, which charters the Bergen, arrived before dawn on Monday, 6 hours after the accident, to coordinate the clean-up. Three environmental firms assisted- Sea Land, from Milford, Hitchcock Gas and Engine, from Branford, and New England Pollution Control from New Haven.

At dawn, crews began to shovel the black sand from the beaches, which the spill had fouled as far east as Branford.

It took twelve days to complete the job. Cleaning the beaches involved shoveling the sand into trucks, scraping the black residue from saltwater marshes, steam-cleaning the rocks on shore, and re-landscaping some of the beaches. Officials in aircraft directed the attack on floating slicks. After they removed the bulk oil with the skimmers, the crews began gathering the more dispersed oil. They used mats that were designed to float on the water and absorb only the oil.

An entire industry has developed around pollution prevention and clean-up. " Back in the sixties, during the Santa Barbara spill days," says Bill Hawley, "they'd just throw straw or styrofoam into the water, and move the pollution from the sea to the land. We've developed a whole new technology to handle a spill. We either recycle the spillage now, or incinerate it, usually leaving the shore in better shape than it was before."

The oil distributor did, in fact, reclaim most of the free oil, and the fouled sand and sludge were taken to oil refuse dumps in Rhode Island. Whether or not the beaches and the water have been restored will be the decision of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection. State engineers monitored the clean-up and are still analyzing sand and water samples for oil residue. If they find the clean-up lacking, they will order additional repairs; so far they have not.

tal Protection also monitors long 
range ecological effects of the spill. 
Some oil inevitably escapes the 
clean-up, or sinks to the ocean floor.

One man's view of the harbor 
Andy Panzo is short and fat, about 
fifty years old. He walks with a heavy 
limp, has a wart on his left eyelid, 
and a large diamond on his finger. 
His hands move in broad gestures 
when he talks, which on the job is 
less frequently than he would like. 
Andy Panzo is a tender of the Ferry 
Street Bridge. 
"Best bombshelter in New Hav-
en!" he says of the bridge tower, a 
massive stone structure built in 1940 
under the WP A. The living quarters 
consist of a small dark room with a 
couch, two chairs and a television. 
Panzo is rarely inside when the 
weather is good. 
"I've seen everything but dead 
bodies float under this bridge,'' he 
says. "Used to be we'd swim down 
here as kids. Back then you could see 
your feet in the water, and along the 
shore there"- he points to the east-
em shore of Quinnipiac River and a 
building with the faded words, 
BROWN SEED OYSTER-"used 
to be oyster houses. Used to oe an 
old lady, she'd run a coupla the 
places-! don'tmeanjustown 'em, I 
mean run 'em, shellin' the oysters 
herself." 
Oysters are no longer harvested 
in New Haven, because the harbor's 
polluted waters make them inedible. 
Some elements of the oyster com-
munity still exist-the shingle style 
homes along the lush slope down to 
the river, a few of the old piers and 
boats. But the oyster docks are di-
lapidated and the boats have been 
hauled and abandoned. The few re-
maining traces of the oyster industry 
are barely discernible on the river's 
shores, where oil tanks now set the 
mood. 
"The big boats," says Panzo, "the 
ones you have to raise the bridge for, 
they used to come through to the 
tanks on the shore until they got the 
pipeline in." The pipeline carries oil 
from the New Haven Terminal, 
where the tankers now unload, to 
tanks around the harbor. Like all the 
tanks, the ones near Panzo's bridge 
are large and round and have com-
pany names painted on them. They 
set the river off from the land, break-
ing the fragile interplay of forms. 
The river's edge has become a wall. 
If Panzo seems blase about the 
harbor and t~ pollution beneath his 
bridge,..it is because he suspects it 
does little good to care. He has lived 
near the harbor all his life, and has 
seen it change. Now there is oil and 
sewage and industrial waste in the 
water, and Panzo is resigned to their 
presence. He watches the water 
just closely enough to do his jo}?-
listen for the signal blasts, seal the 
roadway shut, pull the levers down. 
He does not work alone: two men 
tend the bridge for eight-hour shifts, 
one as flagman and the other as oper-
ator. Many of the other tenders are 
under thirty years of age, and Panzo 
cannot understand this. 
"No job for a young fellow," he 
says, "it's too damn boring. You 
think I'd be here now if I hadn't got 
laid up so bad?" Panzo worked on 
the road crew that built Interstate 95 
until a ditch he was digging caved in, 
burying him in rock and sand up to 
his neck. "I was laid up for three 
years until I could walk again. This 
is about the only job I could take af-
ter that." 
· 
The construction of the turnpike 
also left its mark on the life in the 
harbor. According to Panzo, the 
dredging for the turnpike bridge 
helped destroy the oyster beds. "I 
don't know that they could tell that 
would happen, but it sure did. Gov-
ernment came in afterwards and 
started pay in' for some of the oyster-
in' because the oyster men hollered 
so loud. They had a point, but the 
damage was done." 
His attitude toward the govern-
ment is more fatalistic than bitter; 
Panzo is a public employee. The de-
struction that progress brings seems 
somehow necessary to him, and, 
besides, the government can usually 
be counted on to pick up the pieces 
afterwards. He has his evidence-his 
job and the subsidized oyster indus-
try. Panzo looks at the turnpike and 
says, "When Uncle Sam foots the 
bill, time marches on." 
He has few complaints. He 
doesn't like to look at the harbor any 
more, but he knows it very well and 
its people know him. He is, in fact, 
somewhat of an institution judging 
by the number of horns that sound 
as cars hum over the bridge's steel 
grating. "Kids come out here from 
Yale all the time too, with their ca-
meras and notebooks," he says. 
Andy Panzo is tired of the harbor. 
He used to fish and swim there with 
his friends; now he avoids the water 
after work. When he talks about the 
present, he talks about apartment 
life and the team he coaches in the 
Little League. 0

damage than the esthetically dis-
pleasing surface spillage, and is im-
possible to clean. Fortunately, the 
type of oil involved was not highly 
soluble, therefore it did not pene-
trate the water as much as a lighter 
oil might have. The settled oil will 
be watched closely by the D.E.P. to 
learn just how severely the bottom 
life in the harbor was damaged. Very 
few waterfowl or fish were harmed 
during the spill, mostly because no 
time was wasted clearing the oil 
from the water and the shore. 
The clean-up proceeded with re-
markable cooperation. "Those com-
panies worked side by side, twelve 
hours a day, and all day on the free 
oil in the slip," said Walter Temple, 
operations vice-president at Wyatt. 
"A few years ago the same job would 
have taken two or three times as 
long." All the parties involved-
Exxon, Wyatt, the environmental 
engineering companies and the Coast 
Guard -met at the start of each day 
to plan the most efficient use of man-
power and equipment. The coopera-
tion was due, at least in part, to a 
sure source of funds. 
Exxon has an agreement with all 
its chartered tankers that it will ini-
tiate and guarantee payment for the 
entire clean-up operation for any of 
their spills. The popular belief that 
they have a legal responsibility to do 
so is wrong. In this case, a Greek 
company owned the ship and was 
under contract to carry Exxon's car-
go. Just as a train line assumes re-
sponsibility for its freight, so the 
Greek company was responsible for 
the safe transport of the oil. 
Exxon is aware, however, that no 
one remembers a Greek tanker com-
pany when a spill occurs-they just 
remember that "Exxon's had an-
other spill." To counter this publi-
city, they insure payment for the 
clean-up and make certain the job 
gets started quickly and is handled 
well. They will not pay for the clean-
~p in the long run-whoever is found 
legally responsible will have to pay 
Exxon back. But the important fact 
is that Exxon saw that as little dam-
age was done as possible, and took 
the immediate responsibility for the 
clean-up. This is a direct result of 
public outrage over accidents in the 
past few years. In effect, the public 
has held the oil companies account-
able for damage to the waterways. 
These companies have both the cap-
ital and the manpower for such vigi-
lance, and their resources are far bet-
ter suited to the task than are there-
sources of any local agency. 
No one, least of all the companies

'/ 
themselves, wants an oil spill. 
Though Hawley declined to state the 
cost of a clean-up, one source said it 
costs about $2,000 per hour. If this is 
correct, the New Haven spill costal-
most half a million dollars-a consid-
erable deterrent to everyone in-
volved. There are fewer deterrents, 
however, against another form of oil 
pollution, far more damaging in the 
long run, that takes place just be-
yond the public eye. 
Each tanker that discharges its 
cargo in the northern states cleans 
its cargo tanks at sea on the way 
back to the Gulf of Mexico or the 
Caribbean, dumping the waste over 
the side. The practice is illegal, but 
virtually impossible to police. The 
ecological implications of this abuse 
far outweigh those of a small spill 
in New Haven, but because it occurs 
offshore it continues unnoticed or 
ignored by the public. 
Small boats also contribute a large 
percentage of the oil pollution in the 
sea. It seems unlikely, however, that 
government will attempt to control 
the pollution by small craft.in the 
same way it atte~pts to regulate 
that by ocean-going vessels. Yachts-
men would never consent to this in-
terference, yet are often the most 
vocal critics of the oil industry. 
The public's insatiable appetite 
for petroleum products puts great 
demand on the shipping industry, 
increasing the likelihood of acci-
dents. Reducing consumption would 
mean reducing pollution, and the pro-
bability of oil spills as well. But it is 
much easier, it seems, to affect out-
rage at the accidents, demand they 
be fixed, then continue intentional 
pollution as if all is well. A life style 
is harder to fix. 
New Haven once had a superb re-
source in its harbor. Many people 
made their living from the rich oys-
ter beds there, and much of commun-
ity life centered around jobs andre-
creation connected with the sea. Pro-
gress and industry have taken their 
tolls, and now the interstate highway 
separates the harbor from the city. 
The beach near Long Wharf is 
strewn with garbage, and industrial 
waste and sewage flow into the har-
bor. 
A few signs indicate that New 
Haven; like Boston and San Fran-
cisco, is beginning to rediscover its 
harbor by renewing waterfront com-
munities and cleaning the water it-
self. A new restaurant will soon open 
on the West Haven shore, and Mor-
ris Cove- on the eastern side of the 
harbor- now has a marina which of-
fers public sailing lessons. But the 
improvements do not touch the 
blighted industrial section of the 
harbor. 
The recent spill will no doubt dis-
courage developers from settling 
along the shore. Although the clean-
up succeeded this time, the prospect 
of another spill under less fortunate 
circumstances appears all too real. 
It could cancel out years of planning, 
and reverse whatever gains might 
have been made in the fight against 
industrial pollution. The scenario is 
disheartening, and it partly explains 
why New Haven people care so little 
for their harbor. 
The ironies are painful. The public 
demands an entire clean-up industry 
be invented to handle accidents, yet 
tolerates and commits intentional 
pollution. The New Haven oil spill-
a model of concern and cooperation 
by the industry-received wide-
spread coverage_. then was quickly 
forgotten. The "perfect spill" was 
cleaned; the more difficult crises re-
main. It may be that the current 
economic value of the port is worth 
more to the city than clean water and 
a living waterfront community. Yet 
it is clear that a more thoughtful 
approach not only to New Haven 
harbor but to all our waterways is 
essential unless we are prepared to 
choke in our own over-consumotion. 0

Tastelessness Done Damn Well 
by David W. Dunlap 
"I'd also like to take this opportuni-
ty to make a brassiere out of a hand-
kerchief. It's something we usually 
save for special occasions like this. I 
did go to Harvard, and you can 
understand how I'd like to pad out 
the time. Thank you and fuck you." 
Is this any way to address the for-
mal banquet crowd assembled to 
mark the transition of power at the 
Oldest College Daily? Well, boys and 
girls, it sure is if your name is Doug 
Kenney, senior editor of the fastest-
selling-new-magazine-on-campus. 
The National Lampoon's message, 
carried at our newsstands, in our the-
atres, over our public airwaves, on 
our phonographs, and within the 
privacy of our very own bedrooms is 
this: the best way to express outrage 
is to be outrageous. 
The magazine's tribute to African 
famine is a cover photo of a molded 
chocolate Sahel baby, complete with 
distended stomach, empty food bowl 
and a nice, big, juicy bite taken out 
of its head. President Kennedy is 
seen asking Governor Connally, "My 
insurance company? New England 
Life, of course. Why?" as a tiny 
figure in a distant building window 
prepares to open fire. P'Eggs are of-
fered for sale: pantyhose for women 
whose legs are missing. A special 
contest entitled " Forgotten, But Not 
Gone" rewards the reader who comes 
closest to guessing the date on which 
Mamie Eisenhower will die 
(presumably, the contest is still on). 
A treatise is offered on America's 
greatest Jewish presidents featuring 
a Mount Rushmore monument 
equipped with extra structural brac-
ing to support the weight of the pres-
idents' enormous noses. 
And who is left to safeguard the 
moral fiber of our country? The 
Lampoon artists catch the Supreme 
Court off-guard, in the midst of pon-
dering the obscenity issue. Mr. Jus-
tice Rehnquist, bedecked in Frederick-
of-Hollywood style brassiere and 
panties, is whipping a supine young 
woman who wears nothing but a pair 
of leather boots that the Chief Jus-
tice is licking. Mr. Justice Black.mun 
is found fondling the sexual organs 
of a mature kangaroo, while Mr. Jus-
tice Marshall gazes up at a naked boy 
perched upon a bench, to the obvious 
pleasure of Mr. Justice Douglas-
the very picture of avuncular licen-
tiousness. 


Clearly, there are no standards of 
taste operating within this editorial 
framework. The only discretion is 
that imposed by the Lampoon's le-
gal staff. Most frequently, such con-
trol touches on infringement of copy-
right. It is one thing to propose 
that Richard Nixon and his lieuten-
ants were a group of neo-fascist drag 
queens ("Boys in the Bund" finds 
John Dean advising Dixie Nixon: 
"Listen, Miss Landslide, there are 
some very icky things around that 
are going to need a cover-up. And I 
don't mean your crow's-feet!"). It is 
quite another thing to print a letter-
perfect parody of a Volkswagen ad 
(capitalizing on the Bug's sealed 
chassis and its ability to float on 
water), proposing in the copy that 
"If Ted Kennedy drove a Volks-
wagen, he'd be President today." 
The ad looked too genuine, readers 
mistook it for VW authorized copy, 
and Volkswagen of America sued for 
$500,000. The National Lampoon 
never paid, but withdrew all remain-
ing copies of the magazine with the 
offending add and printed a public 
apology. Co-founder Henry Beard 
points out that "the First Amend-
ment has nothing to do with copy-
right law.'' 

Where the lawyers do not inter-
fere, however, the editors declare 
open season on everyone. And to 
their own amazement ("We weren't 
surprised-we were completely as-
tonished,'' says Beard), the mag-
azine is a commercial success, phe-
nomenal in a period when most per-
iodicals seem to be last-gasping their 
way to extinction. Sandwiched be-
tween extravagant four-color adver-
tisements for the latest, most expen-
sive stereo equipment and record-
ings, the Lampoon's wicked world-
view now sells 900,000 copies a 
month (second only to the formid-
able Playboy in college campus cir-
culation). 

The editors are hard-pressed to 
reconcile this modern marketing mir-
acle tale with their own unflagging 
efforts to alienate every portion of 
America.n society. Such a paradox is 
reflected in their Self-Indulgence is-
sue: a magazine dealing almost ex-
clusively with the editors and writers 
of the Lampoon. In the issue, plans 
are unveiled for the N atLampCo 
Building. In the style of 1930's de-
cadent monumentalism, the building 
rises to 1071 floors and contains its 
own indoor sea, ocean-going ship 
harbor, airport, steeplechase, and 
blimp docks. Elsewhere in the maga-
zine, however, noting that revolu-
tionary heroes of the past have fallen 
by the wayside, dead, or co-opted, 
the Lampoon editors claim that 
"When it comes to revolution ... we're 
all you've got left." 

Boasting inheritance of the revolu-
tionary mantle might seem ill-found-
ed to readers who remember the "Re-
volution" of the late 1960's. The 
Lampoon's cause is unilateral-it 
makes no attempt to appease the 
sensibilities of the Left, and its over-
kill portrayal of racial, ethnic, na-
tional and sexual stereotypes offends 
those who propose to eradicate such 
stereotypes. The Lampoon sends 
Nancy Drew off on "The Case of the 
Missing Heiress." In the course of 
her investigation, Nancy overhears 
the SLA plot out its demands: "Tic-
kets to all Athletic home games." 
"An' a free two-toned Caddy-lak fo' 
de away wunses." "Cinque!" "Yo' 
welcome!'' 

But to the men who carried the 
Harvard Lampoon tradition to na-
tional audiences, the issues were ne-
ver expressed as left vs. right. As 
Cantabridgians, they learned an us 
v&. them ethic. Kenney ('68) and 
Beard ('67) were exposed to too ma-
ny hypocrisies on either side of the 
spectrum. For Kenney, the telling 
moment was the draft counselor who 
belonged to the Progressive Labor 
party. Kenney found it difficult to 
understand how objective a PL mem-
ber's advice would be to bewildered 
draft-age students. The inconsisten-
cies, foibles and deficiencies of the 
New Left provided ammunition 
enough for a good skirmish-throw-
ing in the mediocrity of middle 
America (June Allyson's guide to a 
boring lifestyle; Liz Taylor & Dick 
Burton's tacky gift catalogue with 
J .F .K. toilet seats and pet Koala 
bears-"Kick 'em, punch 'em-they 
won't squeal!"), and the crypto-fas-
cism of the conservatives (a headline 
screams "Chile's Back on the Menu. 
ITT's All Over For Allende."), pro-
vided enough ammo for all-out gue-
rilla warfare.

One of the more subtle myster-
ies of the Lampoon formula is read-
ership appeal. Unlike its contempor-
aries, the Lampoon caters to no one's 
taste. Such a message is clear in the 
editorial policy: there is surely suf-
ficient material in almost any issue

to offend everyone on one level or an-
other. A common strain exists that 
demands a white, Christian, male, 
upper middle class background (with 
working knowledge of the flavor and 
fads of America from Korea to Viet-
nam) to fully appreciate most of the 
parodies in the magazine. But this 
small segment receives perhaps the 
cruelest and most incisive attacks, 
because it is the background Lam-
poon editors know best. It might be 
difficult for WASP's to enjoy Son-
0'-God comics, featuring the savior 
as a muscular super hero. 


It would be a mistake, however, to 
assume that neither criteria nor con-
trols lie behind the Lampoon's wild 
forays. If the magazine is grossly of-
fensive, and Kenney confesses that 
he personally finds "a certain a-
mount of it shocking," such material 
must be superbly scurrilous. It is, in 
Kenney's words, "tastelessness done 
damn well." A cursory comparison of 
the Lampoon with its collegiate imi-
tators and the ill·conceived Harpoon 
will support Kenney's claim. A noth-
ing's-sacred policy encourages the 
impoverished excesses that charac-
terize most of America's pitiful at-
tempts at black humor. The Lam-
poon rises above this morass. 


Beard and Kenney credit the Lam-
poon's legitimacy and excellence to 
former Art Directors Michael Gross 
and David Kaestle. Suffering at its 
birth from the misdirection of Cloud 
Studios, whose graphic designers 
sought to impart an "underground" 
flavor (i.e., Other, Rat, Freep, Barb, 
Seed-remember those, golden-
agers?) to the product, the Lampoon 
quickly sought out the talents of a 
designer who could impart the auth-
oritative stamp of slick, extrava-
gant, Chermayeff/ Glaser/Lubalin 
graphics and Avedon/Penn photo-
graphy to the magazine. Gross has 
done a superlative job in this role: 
parodies (like Psychology Ptoda.y) 
are as close as to be mistaken for the 
"real" thing (Volkswagen proved 
that point conclusively), and the ma-
gazine's own identity (a hybrid of 
jazz modern motifs and Esquire lay-
out) is distinctive and successful. 


" We should have remembered 
from our Harvard Lampoon exper-
ience," Beard notes (he and Kenney 
were chiefly responsible for the re-
markable Life parody -remember 
Life?), "but Michael had to teach us 
again: second-rate writing can be 
completely disguised by excellent 
graphic design." Examples abound 
to support this maxim. The Lam-
poon's own bestial version of Pent-
house, entitled Pethouse, features a 
basset hound named N ana as pet of 
the month. Nana's ga.ms are spread 
invitingly in one photograph, she de-
licately sniffs at her own feces in aJl· 
other. The merit of such indulgence 
is debatable. What is beyond argu-
ment is that the lavish design and 
the elegant, plumed surroundings of 
Nana's world provide a much more 
effective censure of Penthouse than 
any single example of feminist rhe-
toric. It is the designer's success. 


The only standards that Lampoon 
staff members obey are those that 
they impose upon themselves. The 
question of what might please read-
ers is not an issue. Some considera-
tion is given the degree to which the 
audience will apprehend the mater-
ial, but the problem of audience ap-
proval seems to trouble no one at the 
Lampoon. "Sex. will always sell the 
magazine," says Kenney. The Zits & 
Tits combo does move more Lam-
poons at newsstands, but who a-
mong those plunking down the price 
for the Strange Sex issue will empa-
thize with the wedding cake on the 
cover featuring a little plastic groom 
in the company of a little plastic 
sheep? 


'Well, if they don't like it, fuck 
'em," is Kenney's answer to negative 
reader response. "You have to go 
'ha-ha' when you read the maga-
zine," he says. "We must make the 
magazine funny. But we write about 
things to strike a nerve. That's what 
we're trying to ao. We're doing these 
things for shock appeal." The tra-
dition of slapping audiences into ac-
cepting (or, at least, considering) a 
moral message stretches back to 
Aristophanes and includes such 
heavyweights as Swift and Rabelais. 


The day may come when old Lam-
poons are considered suitable read-
ing material in geriatric wards and 
grade schools, but for the moment 
the Lampoon continues to earn the 
vituperative indignation for which 
Kenney and Beard seem to strive. 


In personal encounters, Doug 
Kenney and Henry Beard are most 
amiable and seem to suffer gladly the 
incessant questions (" When did you 
s tart it? Why do you do it? How do 
you get away with it?" ). But even a 
brief trip, in the company of fellow 
editor Tony Hendra, to address the 
Yale Daily News banquet in New 
Haven left no room to doubt their 
purpose and attitude. · ~You have no 
idea what contempt I have for all of 
you/' Kenney told the distinguished 
crowd. "And you have no idea what 
contempt you'll have for me after I 
vomit." The designer, Michael 
Gross, was not present to affect an 
emission of vomit onto the dais, so 
the humor was passed off as locker 
room genre, insulting but frivolous. 


Kenney did not strike an Achille's 
heel that night until he addressed the 
fact that the only black person a-
mong the ba.nquet's guests was 
Rudy Green, Yale football captain 
and recipient of a News athlete-of-
the-year award. In prefacing his 
spoof of Whiffenpoof singing style 
(the Whiffenfruits, as he called 
them), Kenney said that he was 
going "to honor perhaps the oldest 
and most famous of the singing 
groups, known and traditionally 
revered by Yale people and frankly, 
all the people here, with the excep-
tion of the one Negro. Sorry, Rudy. 
You know where it's at, and so do I. 
Kind of fun.ny-if you can laugh at 
it." The News's guests could not 
laugh at it. There were some emba-
rassed chuckles, but the prevailing 
reaction was one of silent, surprised 
anger. Kenney had snatched defeat 
from the jaws of victory-the au-
dience did not like the act. 


Beard was not disappointed by 
the performance, however. "If you 
leave a gathering of mediocre people 
like this without making most of 
them hate you," he said, "you'v~ 
missed a great opportunity." This 
comment, spoken aside as News 
staffers left the dining hall, bears out 
his fellow editor's (Kenney's) phi-
losophy-"if they don't like it, fuck 
'em. " 


The infamous Rudy Green remark 
bears on the touchiest of areas 
through which the Lampoon stam-
pedes, lights on and sirens flashing: 
prejudice. America may be ready for 
the true romance story of "First 
Blowjob" ; or Rodrigues's cartoons 
that cruelly mock the plight of the 
blind, the retarded and the crippled; 
or Tom Eagleton's address to the De-
mocrats: "Bree, bree, ga-ga-ga-ga, 
frip, znip, bzzzt!" But those Amer-
icans who read the Lampoon are 
usually not ready for the word 
Negro. It comes scathingly close to 
the fear of latent racism that per-
meates a liberal society that wants 
to deny the beast. One cannot make 
pious pronouncements about South 
Boston one moment and then laugh 
the next with the black and Puerto 
Rican cast of "All in de Fambly," 
wherein the family poses in silk 
smoking jackets, bathrobes and low-
cut dresses with dollar bills stuffed 
in the cleavage, surrounded by J &B 
bottles, cockroaches, rats, dice, and 
several color television sets. It is 
a troubling tableau for a liberal white 
reader: does one laugh because the 
portrayal is so outrageously wrong 
or because it is so outrageously 
right? Does the use of racism as a 
parodist's device help eradicate 
racism or does it serve to foster and 
prolong racism? 


The dilemma faced when dealing 
in stereotypes to attack stereotypes 
is evident in Kenney's words. For 
three hours, he has treated the New


--- Page 8 ---

Journal to glib answers-informa-
tive, to be sure, but easy. Suddenly 
comes a confession of uncertainty. 
"The race question is the most dif-
ficult thing for me to deal with in the 
magazine." 


"I don't know," he admits. "I 
guess all I can say is that we haue to 
do it. It's just a feeling that we have 
to do it. It's America's last taboo." 


Beard concurs: "We can't afford to 
go easy on anyone.'' The prospect of 
softening up their full-frontal attacks 
is more abhorrent to the editors than 
the criticism such attacks engender. 


• 'I have a lot of Jewish friends,'' 
Kenney continues, "so I'm much 
more sensitive to that issue. I don't 
have many black friends, there aren't 
many black staff members here at the 
magazine. All I can say is that I 
know of two reactions to • All in de 
Fambly.' One was a black guy who's 
very involved with trying to be 
white, and he was disgusted. Then 
there was a black woman who is 
really black, really secure, and she 
loved the piece." 


The Lampoon demands from its 
reader an acceptance of the hyper-
bollc perspective. If one is secure in 
one's personal identity and enlight-
enment, so this argument runs, 
black stereotypes do not threaten 
as much as they inform. Ultimately, 
nothing in the magazine profoundly 
shocks a generation weaned on presi-
dential assassination, urban riots, 
~nd televised Vietnam ("We'll return 
to the war after this word from Ana-
cin ... " ). This notion of a violence-in· 
ured populace is often used to justi-
fy the excesses of contemporary en· 
tertainment. The notion may be 
right: the National Lampoon, a bona 
fide mauler that sooner or later 
leaves everyone gasping in disbelief, 
is a certified marketing success. 


900,000 people paying one dollar 
each to be crassly assaulted and de· 
prived of every precious pretension 
is some kind of achievement. Can it 
continue? 


The Lampoon already seems to be 
standing in an increasingly solitary 
position. "We are now a threat," 
says B-eard. "When we printed the 
word 'fuck' in 1970, everyone was 
printing the word 'fuck.' When 
America had the Black Panthers, the 
National Lampoon seemed harmless." 


But the legendary Panthers have dis-
appeared and Bobby Seale is now a 
municipal politician. So while the 
forces of the Left are busy picking up 
the pieces, the Lampoon may in fact 
be all that remains. 


How can the Lampoon address its 
new·audience effectively? Doug Ken-
ney, class of 1968, is trying to speak 
to college freshmen of the class of 
1978. They are a different breed of 
student. "When I was at Harvard," 
Beard notes, "there was an unspo· 
ken understanding that some people 
had better things to do than go to 
class; they had come to Harvard for 
different reasons. I spent my life at 
the Harvard Lampoon, and still 
managed to graduate cum laude. 
Harvard understood that academic 
honors were for parents.'' Kenney 
summarizes the intra-generation gap 
succinctly: "You know what the best-
selling book on campus is today? I'm 
O.K., You're O.K. Can you believe 
that? I couldn't. Because I'm not 
O.K.!" 


Yet Kenney is doing very well by 
commercial standards. His position 
as an editor of the fastest-selling-
new-magazine-on-campus troubles 
him and epitomizes the nature of the 
Lampoon paradox. The editors pose 
as revolutionaries, but dream up an 
office building that would embarrass 
the most self-indulgent power-broker 
corporation. ''I'm comfortable my· 
self," Kenney tells us, "but I'm get-
ting sicker and more twisted every 
day." 


Such convolutions of spirit con· 
tribute to the malaise any humor 
magazine will suffer. Kenney asks us 
point-blank when we walk into his


--- Page 9 ---

office, "Do you think the Lampoon 
has gone downhill in the past year?" 


Perhaps it has. Energies have been 
drained by special projects: the 
Radio Hour and the 1964 Kaleido-
scope yearbook, the latter a particu· 
larly ambitious and admirable effort 
that has been graced with critical 
approbation and a second printing. 
The past year has seen the departure 
of Michael O'Donoghue, who, with 
Beard and Kenney, was one of the 
Lampoon's three muses, one of the 
forces who shaped the magazine's 
editorial approach. The Lampoon 
has suffered. 


And, after all, comedy is a serious 
business. One chokes on the cliche, 
but the big hoff machine must be 
constantly oiled. The Lampoon's re-
volving editorship policy tries to pre-
vent staff members from burning out, 
but even Kenney had to simply give 
up the routine for more than a year 
in order to function. 


In the Lampoon offices, cluttered 
informality seems to be the rule and 
cross-pollination the medium of com-
munication. Ideas are carried from 
room to room by word of mouth 
while proofs of upcoming issues cir-
culate to the accompaniment of can-
did reaction: "This isn't a great is-
sue, but there's some good stuff in 
it." Kenney asks Matty Simmons, 
chairman of the Lampoon's parent 
company, Twenty First Century 
Communications, to wait before he 
can conduct business. The reason: 
"Matty, I've got some guys from 
Yale here. This is important." The de-
cor is surprisingly subdued, but staff 
encounters seem to be made of 
friendly, facetious wisecracks. What 
happens when the ideas stop circu-
lating? 


"Parody. It's easy. It's popular." 
Kenney speaks of conceptual humor, 
"Original stuff is rare and it's risky. 
Our parodies are appreciated. Some-
times you can really fail with con-
ceptual stuff." Beard goes so far· as 
to say that the National Lampoon is 
parody, that the predominant image 
of the magazine is based on its uni-
que capability for mirror-like parody 
of comic books, hate literature, gov-
ernment publications, glossy maga· 
zines and even the S.A.T. The func-
tion, if not the purpose, of their ef-
forts is, in Kenney's words, "to ex· 
pose the tricks of the magazines.'' 


But derivative humor succeeds only 
as long as the reference is commonly 
understood. What else has the Lam-
poon to offer? 


"Excellent political satire, the 
best in the country,'' Kenney res· 
ponds. Political manhandling ex-
tends from the simple insult (Q: Who 
is Jerry Ford's favorite President? 
A: President Rushmore.) to the 
Lampoon's monthly review of .. News 
on the March." "News" is the first 
section a reader encounters. There, 
in New York Times Cheltenham 
type, the past month's events are 
presented with a deadly twist. The 
assassination of Franco's heir-appa-
rent is headlined with an homage to 
"The Man of La Muerta." The Lam-
poon observes the G.O.P.'s "sCandal 
Semi-Centennial" ( 1923-24/1973-74 ); 
so, too, Israel's celebration of Bomb 
Kippur! -TORAH! TORAH! 
TORAH! ran the headline. Chilean 
citizens bemoan Allende's overthrow 
in a caption coming from La Moneda 
palace: "Our beloved president is 
dead, the victim of a self-inflicted air-
strike. Also, he shot himself twenty-
seven times in the back with a 
machine gun from thirty feet away, 
pausing only once to reload.'' "News 
on the March" greets Ford's acces-
sion to the Presidency with "Demo-
cracy In Action! Ford Elected by 
Smallest Landslide in History. Un-
precedented Mandate: He Carries 
No States, Gets No Votes.'' Later in 
its resignation package ("They've 
Fired the Shit Heard Round the 
World"), the Lampoon reveals that 
several eleventh-hour strategies were 
devised to keep Nixon in office. 
Among them, Nixon dressing in a 
light brown suit and mailing himself 
to his wife at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue. Pat would refrain from 
opening him and anyone trying to 
remove him from the White House 
would be guilty of a federal crime-
interference with the U.S. Mail. 


Future issues will emphasize pol-
itical satire. Beard has become in-
creasingly distressed by the un· 
checked advances of the giant multi-
national corporations. There is much 
new territory to be explored, parti-
cularly as the nation seems to be 
racing headlong into an econo· 
mic and political Goetterdaemmer· 
ung. The call to nostalgia (embodied 
in so many of their parodies) has run 
its course. "The yearbook was a 
great achievement," Beard says, 
"and the last of its kind. How much 
more nostalgia material can we pro· 
duce after that?" The editorial shift 
is under way. 


Kenney goes so far as to see the 
Lampoon as a muckraking journal. 
Kenney and Beard, the original team 
from Harvard, continue to control 
much of the Lampoon's policy. But 
if their perception of the world's 
aberrations as fodder for a humor 
magazine became transformed in 
other hands, the Lampoon could 
easily become a violent and ser· 
ious assailant. "News on the March" 
is commentary of the most sobering 
nature. 


They have become an establish· 
ment in themselves. The National 
Lampoon is the American Humor 
magazine: imitated, reviled, at· 
tacked and sometimes feared-but 
always noticed. Yet the iconoclasm 
shared by Doug Kenney and Henry 
Beard seems to guarantee that the 
Lampoon will not become a com· 
fortable, easy magazine that pulls 
punches and steers clear of contro· 
versy. There is too much delight to 
be had in sending the entire society 
up in elegantly constructed balloons 
and then blowing the balloons to bits 
with relentless, unmerciful attacks. 


For the present, several million read· 
ers eagerly share that delight. 


And in view of a culture that now 
seems to demand discretion, tact and 
compromise, how will the Lampoon 
respond to the increasing pressure to 
make itself more palatable and in· 
offensive? Henry Beard issues the 
answer and the challenge: "We will 
become even more outrageous.'· 


David Dunlap, editor in chief of the 
Yale Banner and freelance contribu· 
tor to the Minneapolis Tribune, is 
rumored to be a senior in Pierson 
College. Such reports, however, are 
largely unsubstantiated.



**Title: Film at Yale: Will the Signs Point to "Yes"?**
**Author: Doug McKinney**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Film at Yale is an iceberg. Beneath 
the surface is a collosal tangle of in-
terests, needs, uses, ignorances, 
amazing talent left truncated and 
abused, great resources developed 
and wasted, high hopes, and a poc-
ketful of wait. Yale does not have a 
Film Department. Yet in the last 
eight years, I have seen the interest 
and activity in film increase at this 
University by spectacular propor-
tions. These gains have come despite 
the administration's unofficial policy 
of non-recognition. But several years 
ago, Yale finally realized that film 
was here to stay. 

One reflects on the screenings, the 
courses, the traditional battle of 
" Film is/is not deemed an appro-
priate course of academic study," 
the mythology surrounding the film 
societies, the love-hate relationship 
between the University and the film 
societies (the relationship is never a 
clear one), and the special events. 
It's very simple: today, everyone is 
affected by movies. The film medium 
is one of the most pervasive and sig-
nificant developments of this cen-
tury (witness the largest movie pro-
ducer in the world: the U.S. DeQart-
ment of Defense). We all grew up 
with film. Media trivia has practi-
cally become a national sport. 

While the importance and undeni-
able influence of film in modem life 
seem obvious-a " given" in any dis-
cussion ~f mass media and art-one 
of the major reasons for a hitherto 
non-commitment to film at Yale has 
been a longstanding faculty disbelief 
in film 's value. Fortunately, as a 
glance at the amount of film screened 
in "respectable" classes shows, this 
attitude is not quite as pervasive as 
it once was. 

Students actually can get degrees 
in film study at Yale, but they must 
first satisfy catches 1-36: that is, the 
course credits. The first twenty 
aren't hard to find, they are the ones 
that insure a liberal education along 
distributional guidelines; actual film 
courses are harder to come by. Get-
ting accepted into a film course at 
Yale is like trying to study in Bei-
necke Library with a ballpoint pen. 

For a long time, Standish Lawder's 
survey course (History of Art 68a) 
was the only game in town. At incep-
tion, its location in the History of 
Art Department was delightfully 
ironic: giving de facto recognition to 
film as an art form, a point contested 
adamantly by many faculty mem-
bers. Stan Lawder has been a one-
man film blitzkrieg at Yale; he de-
serves credit for the Griggs Collec-
tion, the Yale Film Festivals, film-
maker guests, lectures, Yale Film 
Associates (alumni interested in 
film), the Butch Cassidy premiere, 
and those precious few courses. And 
he still has time to "publish." 

With the advent of the College Se-
minar program, film courses began 
to appear in small but significant 
numbers. The reason, of course, was 
student interest. New courses were 
offered in criticism, filmmaking, and

At Yale, I discovered film. On suc-
cessive nights in the fall of 1969, I 
saw Truffaut's 400 Blows, Shoot the 
Piano f'layer, and Jules and Jim-
and I was hooked. Later, I would see 
the real stuff, ftlms by Jean Vigo 
from which Truffaut "borrowed" 
freely. But back when I was a fresh-
man I probably needed the romanti-
cism of the New Wave. My money 
ran out and I joined the staffs of the 
various film societies, thereby avoid-
ing the price of admission. I later 
found that I could be paid to watch 
films. I became a projectionist and 
learned that film had holes running 
down one of its sides and clicked off 
at twenty-four frames a second. I 
also discovered that film was not 
simply an art or an addiction-it was 
a business. 

My sophomore year I made a dis-
covery of equal proportions: a de-
vice. known as Division IV in Film, 
which allowed Y alies to watch films 
to their heart's content while receiv-
ing academic credit. This was a loop-
hole, since eliminated, which let stu-
dents who c.>uldn't write compo-
sitions graduate from Yale. Those 
permissive Sixties. At the same time 
I fell in love with a f'llmmaker who 
was shooting a film based on Dante's 
Inferno. 

My problem was that I was watch-
ing films (passive) and she was mak-
ing films (active). A severe identity 
crisis followed. Result'; I became a 
filmmaker. This was a very easy 
do; one simply had to run around 
and say, " I am a ftlmmaker." Lots of 
people called themselves filmmakers 
then, just as in the Fifties lots of 
Y alies called themselves writers, or 
today call themselves pre-meds. My 
girlfriend and I would talk about the 
features we'd make with Warner Bro-
thers after graduation. We consider-
ed working with Arthur Penn or Sam 
Peckinpah first-just to pa:v our 
dues (after all, we were radicals and 
didn't want to be elitistet. Eventual-
ly, I decided to make my own film. I 
hired my girlfriend and drove to 
North Carolina. The film was about a 
woman there and the way she strug-
gled to accept her son's death. When 
I first knew her. yean before, she 
told ghost stories; now she bad eeen 
her son's ghost, aDd the etoriee were 
about him. 

The film wu a whnk:al failure 
which ended up on the shelf. Y81e 
would DDt teach the technical dimen-
sion of filmmaking, so we had to 
learn the best we could, picking up 
skills from the older students who 
didn't know either. In class, I stud-
ied film with Standish Lawder and 
Jay Leyda. 

Jay Leyda studied with V ertov 
and Eisenstein (whose theoretical 
writings he edited and translated). 
His book, Kino. is perhaps the 
best book ever written on the his-
tory of film. He showed us Vigo's 
films, not Truffaut's. Through Ley-
da, some of us actually learned what 
film was about. But Yale University 
did not understand what Jay Leyda 
was about, and so they encouraged 
him to leave. When Leyda left, film 
began to die at Yale. 

About the same time, I began to 
hear about starving filmmakers. I 
wondered if I should become a doc-
tor, and make medical films on the 
side. Could 1 make a living in the 
film business? I would have to leave 
Yale to find out. I gave Yale one 
more chance. I said (to myself), 
"01(, Yale, make me Scholar of the 
House in Film. Make me the biggest 
minnow in this tide pool and I '11 
stay." I didn't get it, so I left. 

I moved to New York City and 
found an apartment in Hell's Kitch-
en, between the docks and Times 
Square. Bebell and Bebell Film Labs 
was on one side of the apartment, 
and Motion Picture Enterprises was 
on the other. Half a block away was 
the Film Center Building, where the 
elevator operators still tell how Cary 
Grant used to come by thirty years 
ago. I took the elevator to the four-
teenth floor, determined to work my 
way down, handing a resume to any-
one who would take one. I never had 
to find the staircase. A little begin-
ner's luck, and I had a job for three 
days-working on a medical film! 

After that job, I retyped my re-
sume and struck paydirt again, this 
time on the eighth floor with Mature 
Pictures, Inc., the exhibitor of Deep 
Throat. The films Mature Pictures 
had made a few years before were 
"no longer hot enough to have legs," 
so they hired me to splice in some 
hard core inserts. I also thought up 
some "stories," and put together a 
short film using the same footap 
from which I took tbe in8erta. I ed-
ited two Qf the bigpat 8G 8tuB in 
New York. 'lma Rueael aDd Hany 
Reams, but ODC8 tbe film 'opened (op-
poeite Deq J"luvot) I was apia out 
of a job. 

I passed out more resumes. One 
secretary let me see her boss because 
he had gone to Yale, and when it 
turned out we had lived in the same 
residential college, I was in luck 
again. He found me a job that was 
supposed to last two weeks. It lasted 
two years. 

The film I was hired to work on 
was a documentary on the Vietnam 
War, called Hearts and Minds. It 
presents the war as a crisis in the 
American ruling class, and its hero is 
Daniel Ellsberg. While 1 stayed in 
New York to synchronize segments 
of film and soundtrack, the rest of 
the crew went to South Vietnam. 
There, they filmed farmers sifting 
through debris in a village that had 
just been strafed by American 
planes. In the late afternoon, the 
crew would drive back to Saigon, 
back to their hotel and their seven 
course dinners. Documentaries are 
burdened with massive contradic-
tions. 

The ftlm moved from New York to 
Hollywood-from 42nd Street to 
Sunset Boulevard-to be edited, and 
I went with it as the assistant editor. 
Cutting one hundred hours of film 
down to an hour and a half was a 
monstrous job. Just screening the 
materia) took more than a month, 
and the entire job took the better 
part of the year-six days a week, 
ten to eighteen hours a day. 

We watched other people suffer. 
We played with people's lives, and 
the images we had captured were of-
ten the only remaining proof of a vil-
lager's existence. A woman trying to 
climb into her son's grave. A South 
Vietnamese ranger, who would die 
from his wounds, telling how he 
killed a captured Viet Cong captain 
at Quan Tri because, ''They are 
cruel.'' 

The day-to-day grind of filmmak-
ing was a search for pragmatic solu-
tions to narrow problems. I began to 
look forward to the end of the job. 
When we finished the film. I re-
turned to New York, and found an 
aparbnent on the same old block. 
But what I came back for was no 
longer there-people and places had 
changed. I needed a wider perspec-
tive. a rest from the rigors of a .. vo-
cational education." ADd for that,

**Title: The Emperor of Concrete**
**Author: Douglas T. Yates**
**Page number(s): 12**

The Power Broker: Robert Moses 
and the Fall of New. York 
by Robert A. Caro 
Alfred A. Knopf, 1162 pages. $17.50 

Robert Caro has. performed the quite 
extraordinary feat of writing a ser-
ious epic about public works-the 
building of highways, bridges, con-
nectors, parks and public bath 
houses. At first glance, this seems to 
be like writing an opera about gar-
bage collection. The feat is possible, 
because in talking about the physical 
development of New York in this 
century, Caro is able to focus on a 
single "heroic" figure-the Emperor 
of Concrete-Robert Moses. And 
herein lie the strength and weak-
ness of his massive, much-debated 
book. By making Moses appear re-
sponsible for the laying of every 
block of concrete in New York state 
for almost a half-century, Caro is 
able to personalize, politicize, and 
mak~ vivid th~ L~ous enterprise of 
public works construction. This is 
certainly a great virtue, for the read-
er is drawn into the intricacies and 
difficulties of park building and road 
designing with the same intensity 
(and sometimes suspense) that 
comes with reading a finely-con-
structed detective s~ry. 

9n the other hand, in making 
Moses into an epic figure, Caro gets 
into the kinds of difficulties often 
encountered by epic writers. Too 
much attention is paid to Hercules 
and Odysseus to see what is going on 
around them. The hero is made re-
sponsible for everything, his deci-
sions are shrouded with the most ser· 
ious questions of good and evil, and 
his accomplishments must, almost 
by definition, be outsized, heroic. 
Finally, in the epic style (and also 
in the style of tragedy) great atten-
tion is paid to the fatal flaw, the 
overweening pride, the defiance of 
the Gods, the final descent into arro-
gance and rage. Of course, with this 
kind of potent material, it is no won-
der that the epic writer does not 
spend too much time worrying about 
things like political structure and 
context, detailed historical compari-
son, or careful assessment of power 
relations. This is the sort of thing 
historians and political scientists do, 
and they rarely write epics that get 
serialized in the New Yorker. 

So, what you make of Caro's book 
depends on the way you read it. If 
you read it as a modern epic (with 
intimations of Hercules, Achill~, 
Faust, and Lear), it is a delight. Mo-
ses's personality is sharply drawn, 
and the needed events are all there. 
The hero goes from one amazing feat 
of physical construction to another. 
He becomes rich and powerful-and 
then more powerful still. But at last, 
he is corrupted by power (he has sold 
his idealism for more highways); he 
becomes a villain and, at last sight, 
is seen dimly as a bitter old man rag-
ing at a world he does not under-
stand, and that no longer honors 
him. 

If you take Caro simply as a jour-
nalist reporting on the legislative 
process, the techniques of city plan-
ning, and the design of public works 
and recreation facilities, he is also 
fascinating. Seen in this light, the 
book is an encyclopedia of particu-
lar insights into New York govern-
ment-on the structure of public 
authorities, the use of eminent do-
main, and the role of patronage and 
graft in putting together legislative 
deals and public works contracts. 

Finally, if it is not already obvious 
from what I have said, if you read 
Caro simply as a story-teller, he is 
superb. You finish the book won-
dering why these great yarns had not 
been told before or made into a Cecil 
B. DeMille spectacular. 



**A Critique of Robert Caro's "The Power Broker"**

Unfortunately, if you are a poli-
tical scientist or an historian and 
read Caro's book as a serious histor-
ical and political analysis, there is a 
great deal to quarrel with and to be 
disappointed by. In the first place, 
there are serious problems of fact. 
Again, if you are writing an epic it 
does not matter how bad the Augean 
stables really were. But if you are 
writing a careful analysis on public 
sanitation, it does. Caro repeatedly 
exaggerates the problems Moses 
faced, the feats he accomplished, and 
the ease with which he accomplished 
them (all three exaggerations are 
probably necessary, however, in 
building the case that Moses needed 
enormous power to do what he did 
and, gaining that much power, he 
became a public menace in a demo-
cratic society). 

One small example of the method: 
Caro discusses at considerable 
length the heroic task of keeping the 
sand at Jones Beach from blowing 
away. Moses is shown using an army 
of public works employees to plant 
beach grass on the sand dunes. The 
implication is that if Moses had not 
been such an extraordinary power 
broker and task master the whole 
project could never have been accom-
plished. The fact is that there are 
over two hundred yards of fine ocean 
sand at Jones Beach measured from 
the water to the bath house that is 
not protected by dune grass, and 
somehow it has survived from year 
to year without Moses's lavish atten-
tions. More to the point, public 
beaches have been created routinely 
up and down the Atlantic Coast by 
apparently ordinary engineers and 
planners. Many seem to persist with-
out help from anyone but the Com-
prehensive City Planner in The Sky. 

What is interesting about Jones 
Beach is that it was a pioneering ex-
periment designed on a grand scale 
and that it illustrated use ot govern-
ment power in the public interest. 
Caro makes this point, but much of 
the rest of his account of this and 
other facts lies in the realm of thea-
trics and the kind of breathless "you 
are there" journalism associated 
with the writing of Gay Talese. In-
deed, the book that in my judgment 
most clearly resembles Caro's is Tal-ese's account of the building of the 
Verrazano Bridge. The two books 
have a strikingly similar tendency 
to turn public works construction 
into the acme of human daring, ad-
venture, and skill. 

The main trouble with Caro's awe-
struck account of Moses's accom-
plishments is that he constaritly 
loses perspective. Not only have 
other cities and states built beaches 
without Moses but they have also 
built highways, bridges, and all the 
rest. What is more, the pattern of 
this urban cohstruction looks much 
the same in one city after another. 
Caro, the epic writer, tries to attri-
bute much of this national develop-
ment to the influence of Moses 's se-
minal ideas and experiments. But 
any social demographer or economist 
can tell you why the public works 
in our metropolitan areas take the 
form they did without conjuring up 
individual heroes and villains. 

If Moses were not the epic figure 
Caro depicts him as, what can we 
safely say abouthjm? He was surely 
determined, resourceful, and ruth-
less. He served in high levels of gov-
ernment for an unusually long time 
which in itself explains much of his 
impact. In his last years of service, 
he was clearly imperious and cranky. 
He had very important political al-
lies in AI Smith and LaGuardia, and 
they did much to make the Moses 
legend possible. He also obviously 
knew how to get things done-and 
how to use patronage in doing so. 
Caro seems to be shocked by Moses's 
use of under-the-table political tac-
tics and pay-offs. He should study 
public construction in other states 
(Maryland would be a good starting 
point). 

In general we can say that Moses 
won a number of political bat tles, 
but he also lost far more than Caro 
acknowledges. More t han anything 
else, Moses succeeded in becoming a 
secure feudal baron in the turbulent 
world of municipal and state politics. 
In this, he was like countless other 
police chiefs and chairmen of inde-
pendent boards and commissions. 
No doubt, he operated on a bigger 
scale, but he was playing the same 
game. City Hall (and the state gov-
ernment) could not easily get rid of 
him, and so they let him go about his 
business as long as his work com-
manded popular support and until he 
aroused intense opposition and be-
came a liability. Indeed, when the 
public mood turned against Moses, 
he quickly became the favorite scape· 
goat of John Lindsay and Nelson 
Rockefeller. And then all the con-
crete and patronage in the world 
could not long forestall his political 
.decline. 

My point is, that to understand 
Robert Moses we must look at the 
political context in which be worked; 
be was shaped by that context far 
more than be shaped it. My com-
plaint is that Caro refuses to put Mo-
ses in political context, since that 
would spoil the story. Thus Caro 
does not sufficiently underline the 
fact that Moses gained power in 
large part because he was providing 
a winning issue for elected public of-
ficials. Caro does not emphasize that 
there were no existing public 
mechanisms for doing what Moses 
wished to do. The city and the state 
were too fragmented in their organi-
zation to plan for large-scale public 
works. The job called for a centraliz-
ed administrative structure with 
some freedom from the political mar· 
ketplace. This is the same logic that 
led to the creation of the New York 
Port Authority and to similar public 
agencies throughout the country. 

What is more, it was (and is) re· 
formers who called for this kind of 
institution, capable of long-range 
planning and efficient business-
· like administration. 

To argue that Moses was himself 
responsible for creating dangerously 
centralized and unresponsive public 
institutions is to miss the forest for 
the trees. The fact is that there ap· 
pears to be an inevitable and trou-
bling tension between long-range 
planning (that is not subject to nar-
row political manipulation) and ef· 
fective democratic control. 

Finally, in evaluating Moses's ca-
reer, Caro fails to offer any convinc-
ing points of comparison or assess-
ment. He begins and ends with his 
focus firmly fixed on Moses, the fail-
ed prophet, the tragic hero. But how, 
we may ask, did Moses's record ac-
tually compare with public works in 
other American cities? Better, I 
think. How did his methods compare 
with the shamelessly corrupt deal-
ings of t he machine grafters and trac-
tion rings of the 19th Century? Far 
better, I am sure. How did his vision 
compare with other major public lead-
ers in recent American politics? 
Certainly, he bad extraordinary vi-
sion at first, better than most. And 
certainly, his vision became rigid in 
the end-not unlike that of a lot of 
public leaders. 

In the final analysis, the serious 
question posed by Caro's book is 
this: Can we blame Moses for the 
"fall of New York," and thus indi-
rectly for the apparent strangulation 
of American cities by the car and by 
the highway? We can if we wish to 
dismiss virtually every other major 
social. economic and political force 
that has operated in American cities 
in the post-war period. Otherwise 
not, I think. Curiously, Caro never 
honors Moses so much (and so un-
justifiably) as when he places 
Moses's personal power and will 
above that of an entire society. 

In short, in Caro's treatment, 
Moses is made into a god and, for ail 
his objections to the book, that prob-
ably pleases the old boy just fine. O

**Film at Yale**

ready been done in English, French, 
anthropology, American studies, 
and sociology courses. Film study 
is no gut; it just looks that way 
sometimes because it's fun. 

The prospects for original film re· 
search (in any major field) are 
astounding. 

A great deal of film at Yale 
depends on the film societies. With 
four regular (Yale Film Society, Yale 
Law School Film Society, Berkeley 
Film Society, and Ezra Stiles Film 
Society) and a dozen occasional 
groups operating (including depart· 
mental series and the Branford Film· 
makers), there is an incredible 
amount and variety of film screened 
here, more so than at schools with a 
heavy official commitment to film. 

In addition to screenings, the film 
societies have underwritten a num· 
ber of other film activities and events. 
Again, money is always a problem. 
Contrary to popular belief, the Yale 
Film Society and the Yale Law 
School Film Society receive no finan-
cial support from the University. 
The Berkeley College Film Society 
receives only limited support from 
Berkeley College. All the film groups 
operate on a non-profit basis. And 
despite the long lines at the ticket 
counters, nobody is raking it in. The 
ticket receipts of the Law School 
Film Society are used almost entirely 
for operating expenses, special 
events, new equipment and film· 
making grants. 

Essentially, film groups are left to 
run programs on their own. For 
years, Yale carried out a policy of 
benign neglect, occasionally arbitra· 
ting disputes, but hoping not to be 
bothered by the whole thing. For· 
tunately, the film societies prefer to 
cooperate rather than to compete. 
Competition would result in a losing 
situation for everyone, especially the 
audiences. The distinct danger with 
so many different groups running 
shows is that the "pie" of audience 
financial support will get spread too 
thin to allow certain kinds of worth· 
while but less profitable programs to 
be shown. Some of this has already 
been felt, and the overall film pro· 
gram has suffered in recent years 
because of it. 

Screenings have not always been 
as abundant as they are now. The 
first film series at Yale was held in 
the fall of 1935, totally underwritten 
by one undergraduate. There were 
ten filpls, and about fifty people at· 
tended regularly on a subscription 
basis. Film was regarded then as 
something unclean. Ironically, in the 
1920's Yale had produced (i.e., 
funded) some high·budget·for·the-
times documentary films, a series 
called theY ale Chronicles of Amer-
ica. They dealt with large-scale re· 
The New Journal I November 7, 1974 
constructions of scenes from Ameri· 
can history, and were used as educa· 
tiona} films as late as the 1950's. It 
was an incredibly sophisticated, high 
quality operation 

For years, films were shown spo· 
radically at Yale. In the early 
Sixties, theY ale Film Society gradu· 
ally established itself as a regular 
series, mostly on Fridays and Satur· 
days. In the mid-Sixties, screening 
time expanded to Tuesdays, when 
silent films were shown largely in 
conjunction with Standish Lawder's 
course. In 1968, in response to in· 
creasing student demand, an Ameri· 
can Film Series was added on Wed· 
nesdays and Thursdays. At the same 
time, the Yale Law School Film Soci· 
ety established its series on Sundays 
and Mondays, and inaugurated a 
policy of special events-bringing 
directors and other film profes· 
sionals to the campus. The Yale Law 
School Film Society has had Sam 
Peckinpah, Robert Altman and 
Fritz Lang, among others, bring 
t heir new films toY ale. The growth 
of film showings culminated in the 
early Seventies with the proliferation 
of residential college film groups, 
after which it levelled off. Now, the 
Yale community has a unique oppor· 
tunity to see a wide of variety of 
film, something the University 
should be proud of-and which it 
should maintain. 

Another unsung hero in the brief 
history of film at Yale is Charles 
Lewis, director of the Yale Audio 
Visual Center. Virtually all media at 
Yale depends on the efforts of Lewis 
and his staff in spreading the limited 
resources of the University as far as 
they will go. It is embarassing to 
note how ill-equipped Yale is in 
terms of basic equipment and facili· 
ties. a fact t hat professors in need of 
various equipment discover with in· 
credulity. Cameras and editing 
facilities are constantly overbooked. 
It is a testament to the talent of the 
people at Audip·Visual that media 
life at Yale goes on at all. 

The question remains, does Yale 
have a commitment to film? It's like 
asking the Magic 8-Ball. Whenever 
you ask an important question, the 
answer that swims into view is • • Reply 
hazy, try again later." If the funds can 
be found, this response can be amended 
to "Signs point to yes." 

Meanwhile, the Yale College 
Dean's Office, on its own, recently 
organized a screening of Renoir's 
Rules of the Game. There is hope. 

Support your local film society, 
and tell Robin Winks he is missing 
something. Movies are adventure. 
Hope you enjoy the show. O 


**On the "New" American Writing, and Other Matters**
**Author: Joyce Carol Oates**
**Page number(s): 15**

(continued from page 2) 
an odd but typically American par-
A;" ochialism: an inability to realize that 
there have been many historical 
precedents for what is called the 
"new" American writing-Dadaism, 
the post-war French writers, not to 
mention Gogol and his descendents, 
and the ingenue tradition of 19th 
century American writing, especially 
of the frontier. A reasonably well-
informed writer of the present day 
chooses to write in a tradition and is 
not forced into one; the options are 
many, but those who choose to ex-
plore the possibilites of human con-
sciousness are hardly to be ranked 
as "less intellectual" than those who 
are following the anti-psychological 
tradition of the "new" French writers 
(who are hardly new in the 70's). 

A mP.ric.ans are often stmused 
to hear that in Red China, many 
people believe that the assembly line 
was invented by Chairman Mao 
sometime in the 60's-just so it is 
amusing to hear, from undergradu-
ates, that something radically "new" 
and "innovative" has just come 
along, a new American consumer 
product, without history. Charles 
Newman, editor of Triquarterly, has 
summed up this myopic spirit suc-
cinctly: "Nothing like us ever wuz." 

You ask what the "total" vision of 
my work might be: There is none, 
nor can there be any. There is no 
"total" of Barth's work either. (And 
how could your seminar have 
summed it up?-have you really read 
all his books?) Of course a hack writ-
er for an encyclopedia, or a student 
pressed for time on an examination, 
can sum up all of Faulkner in a sen-
tence- all of Hemingway in a cliche-
·~ but these are the usual lit. crit. word-
• 
bubbles, nothing more. Cartoon-bal-
loons arise from earnest, clever faces, 
meant to impress listeners with the 
intellectual depth of the speaker. But 
who is impressed, except those who 
would believe anything? 

Much of the literary judgments I 
encounter are no more than vapor. 
There is a considerable difference 
between intellectual posturing and 
intelligence; why the academic rou-
tinely admires the former, and is irri-
tated by the latter, I have no idea. 
Too much idle time, too much afflu-
ence? But even a pure, unsolipsistic 
rationality has its limitations; as 
Whitehead said, "The function of 
Reason is to promote the art of life.'' 
No one could have put it more beau-
tifully. 

The ceaseless questioning of real-
ity is, of course, exciting when it 
leads to action-on a personal, or a 
political level. Or when it allows an 
evolution of one's vision. But the 
pseudo-problems, the pseudo-state-
ments, the pseudo-inquiries I often 
\ encounter (not just at Yale, of 
course) are only vaporous manner-
isms, ways of filling time. I am not a 
Buddhist, but surely the Buddha 
was correct-many centuries before 
Wittgenstein, even Kant-in point-
ing out gently to a disciple that his 
questions were largely meaningless. 

And yet dangerous: because they 
engage the intellect in silly, ceaseless 
activity, and draw one's attention 
away from direct experience, from 
the eternal-in-the-temporal, from 
what orthodox believers call God and 
others call simply the creative exper-
ience of the world, the activation of 
the objective psyche. I was asked 
why I write-which must be trans-
lated as a question relevant to all 
people, to everyone who attempts 
communication in any way. It is 
really a religious inquiry, at bottom, 
and takes one's entire life to explore: 
Why do I exist? Why do we all exist? 
What are we doing here in this place? 
As Yeats said, man can embody 
truth but cannot articulate it-it is 
experience, not to be reduced to 
verbal shorthand.

**Polite Applause**
**Author: John Ellis with Naomi Pierce**

Polite applause 
The flood lights from the TV camer-
as bathe Jane Fonda's face. The Yale 
Daily News board room is baked and 
musty. From where I am standing, I 
can see her hands tremble as she 
brushes her hair back. Her voice is 
hoarse and it quavers, but she re-
sponds aggressively to questions. 

Ms. Fonda does not tolerate inter-
ruptions-"Please, will you just let 
me fmish," she says. Her message is 
worthy, her diction incisive. She is 
an actress, yet it is still somehow 
shocking to discover that her pas-
sionate appeals-the words that 
seem to rush to her lips-are memo-
rized like lines. They appear verba-
tim in interviews (Playboy and Rol-
ling Stone). 

That night she speaks to the Yale 
Political Union, and the words are 
still largely true. The Indochinese 
War is "still America's war." The 
funds allocated by Congress for the 
Food for Peace P.rogram are being 
used for military purposes. The 
political oppression in South Viet-
nam is atrocious. And so on. 

But what is eerie about her speech 
is not the repetition-it is. the sense 
that almost no one cares anymore. It 
is an indication of how far we've 
gone. The country is wired into a sur-
vival trip now, half crazy with fear 
about the grim slide towards eco-
nomic collapse. The last thing any-
one wants to !).ear about is Vietnam. 
It brings back too. many painful 
memories: the light-at-the-end-of-
the-tunnel peace, getting stomped in 
Chicago, Billy Ray blown to bits in 
An Loc. Most of us are doing our 
best to forget. 

So Jane Fonda speaks into a vac-
uum. There is polite applause as she 
walks up to the altar in Battell Cha-
pel. She delivers a speech which is 
the same speech she has delivered in 
countless other cities across the 
country. Again there is polite ap-
plause. Ms. Fonda takes five or six 
questions from the audience (maybe 
250 strong) and answers them as she 
has for countless publications. One 
watches all this as one watches Carl 
Yastrzemski taking batting practice. 
It is all so matter of fact. There is a 
standing ovation and most everymte 
goes home. Ms. Fonda must attend 
another meeting. What she should 
really do is go over to the Depart-
ment of University Health and get 
some medicine for her throat, for she 
can barely speak. 

Ms. Fonda has been doing this 
sort of thing for almost five years 
now and one can only admire her per-
severance. It is a grim way to spend 
your time. All those hotels, strange 
faces, bad meals, ridiculous ques-
tions which she has answered so 
many times before, all of it so that 
she can lay on another audience one 
of the most fantastic bummers of the 
t-wentieth century. 

Why on earth does she do it? I 
haven't the slightest idea. Every-· 
thing I've either read or heard about 
her has never come close to explain-
ing this most obvious Question. 

Everything she says to the Political 
Union was said back in the middle 
sixties, and if the facts have changed 
somewhat, the ba.sic drifts are exact-
ly the same. Hearing about them in 
1974 only drives me into despair.

represents one of the largest and finest trans-
shipment facilities in southern New England 
today. It coordinates full transfer and trucking 
operations including: (a) modern pier berths 
(b) stevedoring for all types of cargo, (c) ship's 
agent service, (d) warehours and open storage, 
(e) export and import handling, and (f) a uni-
fied trucking service throughout southern New

Today the Terminal maintains three major berths 
affording 35' M'L 'W' at a 650' pier and a quay 
with shipside rail. With these facilities . and with 
New Haven Harbor's 35' deep water channel, the 
largest freighters and tankers of normal draft in 
use today can be acoomodated. 

The Terminal's many acres of open storage, and mil-
lion cubic feet of (dry pipe protected) warehouse 
space are served by spurs which connect directly 
with the Penn Central main line to Boston and 
New York, Hartford -Springfield-Worcester line, 
etc. Motor line connections and trucks benefit from
