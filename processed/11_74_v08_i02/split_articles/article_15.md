At Yale, I discovered film. On suc-
cessive nights in the fall of 1969, I 
saw Truffaut's 400 Blows, Shoot the 
Piano f'layer, and Jules and Jim-
and I was hooked. Later, I would see 
the real stuff, ftlms by Jean Vigo 
from which Truffaut "borrowed" 
freely. But back when I was a fresh-
man I probably needed the romanti-
cism of the New Wave. My money 
ran out and I joined the staffs of the 
various film societies, thereby avoid-
ing the price of admission. I later 
found that I could be paid to watch 
films. I became a projectionist and 
learned that film had holes running 
down one of its sides and clicked off 
at twenty-four frames a second. I 
also discovered that film was not 
simply an art or an addiction-it was 
a business. 

My sophomore year I made a dis-
covery of equal proportions: a de-
vice. known as Division IV in Film, 
which allowed Y alies to watch films 
to their heart's content while receiv-
ing academic credit. This was a loop-
hole, since eliminated, which let stu-
dents who c.>uldn't write compo-
sitions graduate from Yale. Those 
permissive Sixties. At the same time 
I fell in love with a f'llmmaker who 
was shooting a film based on Dante's 
Inferno. 

My problem was that I was watch-
ing films (passive) and she was mak-
ing films (active). A severe identity 
crisis followed. Result'; I became a 
filmmaker. This was a very easy 
do; one simply had to run around 
and say, " I am a ftlmmaker." Lots of 
people called themselves filmmakers 
then, just as in the Fifties lots of 
Y alies called themselves writers, or 
today call themselves pre-meds. My 
girlfriend and I would talk about the 
features we'd make with Warner Bro-
thers after graduation. We consider-
ed working with Arthur Penn or Sam 
Peckinpah first-just to pa:v our 
dues (after all, we were radicals and 
didn't want to be elitistet. Eventual-
ly, I decided to make my own film. I 
hired my girlfriend and drove to 
North Carolina. The film was about a 
woman there and the way she strug-
gled to accept her son's death. When 
I first knew her. yean before, she 
told ghost stories; now she bad eeen 
her son's ghost, aDd the etoriee were 
about him. 

The film wu a whnk:al failure 
which ended up on the shelf. Y81e 
would DDt teach the technical dimen-
sion of filmmaking, so we had to 
learn the best we could, picking up 
skills from the older students who 
didn't know either. In class, I stud-
ied film with Standish Lawder and 
Jay Leyda. 

Jay Leyda studied with V ertov 
and Eisenstein (whose theoretical 
writings he edited and translated). 
His book, Kino. is perhaps the 
best book ever written on the his-
tory of film. He showed us Vigo's 
films, not Truffaut's. Through Ley-
da, some of us actually learned what 
film was about. But Yale University 
did not understand what Jay Leyda 
was about, and so they encouraged 
him to leave. When Leyda left, film 
began to die at Yale. 

About the same time, I began to 
hear about starving filmmakers. I 
wondered if I should become a doc-
tor, and make medical films on the 
side. Could 1 make a living in the 
film business? I would have to leave 
Yale to find out. I gave Yale one 
more chance. I said (to myself), 
"01(, Yale, make me Scholar of the 
House in Film. Make me the biggest 
minnow in this tide pool and I '11 
stay." I didn't get it, so I left. 

I moved to New York City and 
found an apartment in Hell's Kitch-
en, between the docks and Times 
Square. Bebell and Bebell Film Labs 
was on one side of the apartment, 
and Motion Picture Enterprises was 
on the other. Half a block away was 
the Film Center Building, where the 
elevator operators still tell how Cary 
Grant used to come by thirty years 
ago. I took the elevator to the four-
teenth floor, determined to work my 
way down, handing a resume to any-
one who would take one. I never had 
to find the staircase. A little begin-
ner's luck, and I had a job for three 
days-working on a medical film! 

After that job, I retyped my re-
sume and struck paydirt again, this 
time on the eighth floor with Mature 
Pictures, Inc., the exhibitor of Deep 
Throat. The films Mature Pictures 
had made a few years before were 
"no longer hot enough to have legs," 
so they hired me to splice in some 
hard core inserts. I also thought up 
some "stories," and put together a 
short film using the same footap 
from which I took tbe in8erta. I ed-
ited two Qf the bigpat 8G 8tuB in 
New York. 'lma Rueael aDd Hany 
Reams, but ODC8 tbe film 'opened (op-
poeite Deq J"luvot) I was apia out 
of a job. 

I passed out more resumes. One 
secretary let me see her boss because 
he had gone to Yale, and when it 
turned out we had lived in the same 
residential college, I was in luck 
again. He found me a job that was 
supposed to last two weeks. It lasted 
two years. 

The film I was hired to work on 
was a documentary on the Vietnam 
War, called Hearts and Minds. It 
presents the war as a crisis in the 
American ruling class, and its hero is 
Daniel Ellsberg. While 1 stayed in 
New York to synchronize segments 
of film and soundtrack, the rest of 
the crew went to South Vietnam. 
There, they filmed farmers sifting 
through debris in a village that had 
just been strafed by American 
planes. In the late afternoon, the 
crew would drive back to Saigon, 
back to their hotel and their seven 
course dinners. Documentaries are 
burdened with massive contradic-
tions. 

The ftlm moved from New York to 
Hollywood-from 42nd Street to 
Sunset Boulevard-to be edited, and 
I went with it as the assistant editor. 
Cutting one hundred hours of film 
down to an hour and a half was a 
monstrous job. Just screening the 
materia) took more than a month, 
and the entire job took the better 
part of the year-six days a week, 
ten to eighteen hours a day. 

We watched other people suffer. 
We played with people's lives, and 
the images we had captured were of-
ten the only remaining proof of a vil-
lager's existence. A woman trying to 
climb into her son's grave. A South 
Vietnamese ranger, who would die 
from his wounds, telling how he 
killed a captured Viet Cong captain 
at Quan Tri because, ''They are 
cruel.'' 

The day-to-day grind of filmmak-
ing was a search for pragmatic solu-
tions to narrow problems. I began to 
look forward to the end of the job. 
When we finished the film. I re-
turned to New York, and found an 
aparbnent on the same old block. 
But what I came back for was no 
longer there-people and places had 
changed. I needed a wider perspec-
tive. a rest from the rigors of a .. vo-
cational education." ADd for that, 
Yale would not. be a bad place. 0
