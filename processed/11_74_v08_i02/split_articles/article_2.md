I was asked why I write


The Yale of our brief and no doubt superficial experience is rather homogeneous; the atmosphere is intense, confined, analytical. I came away wondering if a remark made by a young woman during our Fiction Seminar might be representative, since it was incidental and went unchallenged-she alluded with contempt to a "mass" audience, a "mass market" population, as if there were hordes of unclean, brain-damaged barbarians swarming out in America, beyond the walls of Yale's colleges. I am not a political radical, but I am idealistic enough to believe that the basic philosophy of democracy is both intellectually and morally sound-and in any case, the implicit elitism and snobbery of such remarks are contrary to the'spirit of any "American studies" program. I said nothing at the time-I was rather shocked.

Not only was there the evidently unconscious assumption of the superiority of everyone in the seminar, or in the room, but the frank, complacent expression of this sentiment. If, as is quite probable, Yale's students have higher I.Q.'s than the "masses," this is to be attributed to heredity, good nutrition, and general affluence-to one's family's money, in short. No one need imagine himself or herself superior to the "masses"; we do not create ourselves, and even geniuses have no cause to feel pride.

Outside the formal seminar, I met innumerable people of natural, unstrained intelligence; inside the seminar, there was an emphasis upon artificial intellectualizing, the kind of Lit. crit. posturing that writers like Ionesco, Nabokov, Barth, Bellow, and many others (including, I suppose, myself) have always delighted in parodying. Criticism is a secondary activity: even the artist, when he is attempting criticism, realizes the Limitations of what he is doing. But it is easy to forget, to imagine that by juggling cliches and currently fashionable jargon, one has captured the essence of art. Where there is no natural sense of creativity, or no ability along such lines, there is often the illusion of superiority because one can "make judgments." Perhaps this goes along with the elitism I sensed.

One example will do: the critic assigns the writer a category. If the writer is morally involved with his society, he is called "didactic" and therefore inferior; if he is concerned mainly with art, he is Art-for-art's sake, and in danger of being rejected as a "dandy" (in Camus's sense of the word). So the critic achieves an illusory victory over the writer-but it is illusory, indeed.

I was also struck during the seminar by the inquiry of whether I was "bothered" that some students in the seminar believed my stories to be funny, and some did not-as if anyone with a sense of his own identity, whether a writer or not, could be presumed to be so easily swayed by the casual opinions of strangers. A conscious artist is, of course, open to opinions and judgments by individuals whose work he or she admires-people whose personalities or achievements indicate that their remarks should be taken seriously. But only a politician is anxious to please everyone, to conform to whatever attitudes a certain group seems to hold. I know this question was put to me innocently-but, like many remarks uttered in innocence, in near-unconsciousness, it reveals a great deal. Would it alarm you to be told that the emotions, moods, likes and dislikes, and various expressions of opinion of late adolescence are really not terribly important?

Along these lines, I also noticed (continued on page 15)
