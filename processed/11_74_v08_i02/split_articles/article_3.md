**Title: The Perfect Spill**

"It was a perfect oil spill," says Bill Hawley, a partner at Sea Land Environmental Engineering in Milford, Connecticut. " If there had to be a spill, it couldn't have gone better."

On Sunday, October 6, 100,000 gallons of black oil poured into New Haven harbor from the ruptured forward compartments of the 560 foot long S.S. Messinaki Bergen. More than half the spillage was contained by floating protective booms, and the oil that did escape before the ship reached its berth became the focus of an intensive 12·day clean-up operation.

The story received front page headlines in the New Haven newspapers for two days, and then the issue faded. An editorial in The New Haven Register two days after the spill briefly mentioned the general abuse of the nation's waterways, but focused on the facts of the local accident rather than their implications. The coverage was superficial.

Few traces of the spill remain-the oil is gone from the beaches, the heavy industrial traffic in the harbor continues, and S.S. Messinaki Bergen has left to carry another cargo. ·with the routine successfully restored, industry officials are congratulating themselves for their efficiency. while the public happily turns its concern away from the harbor. In the aftermath of a near-disaster has come relief rather than reflection.

A dozen things could have gone wrong. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Bergen was making a normal approach through the harbor's ship channel just after midnight Sunday morning when the crew felt a slight impact. Had the accident been worse, more of the ship's hull might have been ruptured. Had the ship grounded on the obstruction, a major rescue operation would have been required with tugboats pulling the tanker free as she continued to spew oil into the harbor. Also, the Coast Guard might have instructed the leaking ship to remain away from the shore. This safety precaution would have caused a far greater spill.

Instead, the Coast Guard told the ship's captain to proceed to the ship's berth at Wyatt, Inc., a local commercial oil distributor. Although a visual check from the vessel's stern did not reveal any leakage, Wyatt personnel prepared their emergency containment system-a floating plastic boom that traps any free oil on the water's surface inside the company's dock. When the ship arrived at the pier, a Wyatt crew immediately deployed the protective boom around the stern of the ship. The boom kept 60,000 gallons of oil from flowing across the harbor.

Forty thousand gallons had already escaped, but since the wind was light the spill did not spread far. Had it been anything other than a calm, warm night, the initial emergency measures and the subsequent clean-up would have proved much more difficult. Once the mishap had occurred, luck seemed to be playing a major role in its repair.

The clean-up began soon after the leaking Bergen reached the pier-the contained oil near the Wyatt dock was the first target. The crew used heavy-duty skimmers-wide-mouthed suction tubes submerged a few inches beneath the surface-to draw the oil into tank trucks, which were then emptied into Wyatt storage tanks.

An official from Exxon International, which charters the Bergen, arrived before dawn on Monday, 6 hours after the accident, to coordinate the clean-up. Three environmental firms assisted- Sea Land, from Milford, Hitchcock Gas and Engine, from Branford, and New England Pollution Control from New Haven.

At dawn, crews began to shovel the black sand from the beaches, which the spill had fouled as far east as Branford.

It took twelve days to complete the job. Cleaning the beaches involved shoveling the sand into trucks, scraping the black residue from saltwater marshes, steam-cleaning the rocks on shore, and re-landscaping some of the beaches. Officials in aircraft directed the attack on floating slicks. After they removed the bulk oil with the skimmers, the crews began gathering the more dispersed oil. They used mats that were designed to float on the water and absorb only the oil.

An entire industry has developed around pollution prevention and clean-up. " Back in the sixties, during the Santa Barbara spill days," says Bill Hawley, "they'd just throw straw or styrofoam into the water, and move the pollution from the sea to the land. We've developed a whole new technology to handle a spill. We either recycle the spillage now, or incinerate it, usually leaving the shore in better shape than it was before."

The oil distributor did, in fact, reclaim most of the free oil, and the fouled sand and sludge were taken to oil refuse dumps in Rhode Island. Whether or not the beaches and the water have been restored will be the decision of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection. State engineers monitored the clean-up and are still analyzing sand and water samples for oil residue. If they find the clean-up lacking, they will order additional repairs; so far they have not.
