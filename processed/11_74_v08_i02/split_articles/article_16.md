The Power Broker: Robert Moses 
and the Fall of New. York 
by Robert A. Caro 
Alfred A. Knopf, 1162 pages. $17.50 

Robert Caro has. performed the quite 
extraordinary feat of writing a ser-
ious epic about public works-the 
building of highways, bridges, con-
nectors, parks and public bath 
houses. At first glance, this seems to 
be like writing an opera about gar-
bage collection. The feat is possible, 
because in talking about the physical 
development of New York in this 
century, Caro is able to focus on a 
single "heroic" figure-the Emperor 
of Concrete-Robert Moses. And 
herein lie the strength and weak-
ness of his massive, much-debated 
book. By making Moses appear re-
sponsible for the laying of every 
block of concrete in New York state 
for almost a half-century, Caro is 
able to personalize, politicize, and 
mak~ vivid th~ L~ous enterprise of 
public works construction. This is 
certainly a great virtue, for the read-
er is drawn into the intricacies and 
difficulties of park building and road 
designing with the same intensity 
(and sometimes suspense) that 
comes with reading a finely-con-
structed detective s~ry. 

9n the other hand, in making 
Moses into an epic figure, Caro gets 
into the kinds of difficulties often 
encountered by epic writers. Too 
much attention is paid to Hercules 
and Odysseus to see what is going on 
around them. The hero is made re-
sponsible for everything, his deci-
sions are shrouded with the most serÂ· 
ious questions of good and evil, and 
his accomplishments must, almost 
by definition, be outsized, heroic. 
Finally, in the epic style (and also 
in the style of tragedy) great atten-
tion is paid to the fatal flaw, the 
overweening pride, the defiance of 
the Gods, the final descent into arro-
gance and rage. Of course, with this 
kind of potent material, it is no won-
der that the epic writer does not 
spend too much time worrying about 
things like political structure and 
context, detailed historical compari-
son, or careful assessment of power 
relations. This is the sort of thing 
historians and political scientists do, 
and they rarely write epics that get 
serialized in the New Yorker. 

So, what you make of Caro's book 
depends on the way you read it. If 
you read it as a modern epic (with 
intimations of Hercules, Achill~, 
Faust, and Lear), it is a delight. Mo-
ses's personality is sharply drawn, 
and the needed events are all there. 
The hero goes from one amazing feat 
of physical construction to another. 
He becomes rich and powerful-and 
then more powerful still. But at last, 
he is corrupted by power (he has sold 
his idealism for more highways); he 
becomes a villain and, at last sight, 
is seen dimly as a bitter old man rag-
ing at a world he does not under-
stand, and that no longer honors 
him. 

If you take Caro simply as a jour-
nalist reporting on the legislative 
process, the techniques of city plan-
ning, and the design of public works 
and recreation facilities, he is also 
fascinating. Seen in this light, the 
book is an encyclopedia of particu-
lar insights into New York govern-
ment-on the structure of public 
authorities, the use of eminent do-
main, and the role of patronage and 
graft in putting together legislative 
deals and public works contracts. 

Finally, if it is not already obvious 
from what I have said, if you read 
Caro simply as a story-teller, he is 
superb. You finish the book won-
dering why these great yarns had not 
been told before or made into a Cecil 
B. DeMille spectacular.
