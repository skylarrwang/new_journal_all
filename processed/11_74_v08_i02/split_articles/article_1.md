The old A Y A coffee pot was a boil and percolating alumni. Imperialists of the meaningful expression had returned for another go, a quick alcoholic transumption with the past, a boisterous revel through foggy rooms, through Mory's, and the squashed muffins of brunch. They came for circuses and they got them-this was the 1974 alumni convocation and its topic was "Trends in Athletics." All these cheerful, maudlin relics made their own nostalgia in the cavern of Commons, their chance at the big time, three rings strong. ;

God only knows what brought them all here. It couldn't have been Brewster, certainly not the Association of Yale Alumni-and would you come to New Haven just to give money? And that trumped up topic of athletics was about as enticing as sweat sock stew. Maybe the invitation contained a dare-spend three days in this unspeakable town and we will give you whatever is behind the curtain. Maybe there were veiled threats to the family dog. For sure it was something crafty that only the most devilish of the Machiavels at Woodbridge Hall could devise: Come or we will burn your yearbook. The helpless hundreds came.

But of course they loved it. Smoking big cigars in public, opening heavy doors with assurance, glowering at menials, lurking about the gyro-superb! Finally a banquet at Woolsey hosted by the President and co-conspirators- bliss! Dinner as usual aboard the Titanic, the rich and beautiful awed and impressed by the sheer spectacle-the giant YALE banner, the cameras and lights, the obsequious servants in traditional livery. Not the slightest hint of chill in the air.

They heard the same tirades and pleas: they supplied the same attention and wild applause. Here we all are-Joy! Help us out (even though we blew it last time!). Bravo! Good old Yale- Hurrah! The dollars ring in. Somewhere a blue and white Jerry Lewis is watching the tote board climb. The cash wheels spin, only 300 million more, go, go, GO.' Look at us, we're walking!
