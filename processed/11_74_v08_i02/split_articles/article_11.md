damage than the esthetically dis-
pleasing surface spillage, and is im-
possible to clean. Fortunately, the 
type of oil involved was not highly 
soluble, therefore it did not pene-
trate the water as much as a lighter 
oil might have. The settled oil will 
be watched closely by the D.E.P. to 
learn just how severely the bottom 
life in the harbor was damaged. Very 
few waterfowl or fish were harmed 
during the spill, mostly because no 
time was wasted clearing the oil 
from the water and the shore. 
The clean-up proceeded with re-
markable cooperation. "Those com-
panies worked side by side, twelve 
hours a day, and all day on the free 
oil in the slip," said Walter Temple, 
operations vice-president at Wyatt. 
"A few years ago the same job would 
have taken two or three times as 
long." All the parties involved-
Exxon, Wyatt, the environmental 
engineering companies and the Coast 
Guard -met at the start of each day 
to plan the most efficient use of man-
power and equipment. The coopera-
tion was due, at least in part, to a 
sure source of funds. 
Exxon has an agreement with all 
its chartered tankers that it will ini-
tiate and guarantee payment for the 
entire clean-up operation for any of 
their spills. The popular belief that 
they have a legal responsibility to do 
so is wrong. In this case, a Greek 
company owned the ship and was 
under contract to carry Exxon's car-
go. Just as a train line assumes re-
sponsibility for its freight, so the 
Greek company was responsible for 
the safe transport of the oil. 
Exxon is aware, however, that no 
one remembers a Greek tanker com-
pany when a spill occurs-they just 
remember that "Exxon's had an-
other spill." To counter this publi-
city, they insure payment for the 
clean-up and make certain the job 
gets started quickly and is handled 
well. They will not pay for the clean-
~p in the long run-whoever is found 
legally responsible will have to pay 
Exxon back. But the important fact 
is that Exxon saw that as little dam-
age was done as possible, and took 
the immediate responsibility for the 
clean-up. This is a direct result of 
public outrage over accidents in the 
past few years. In effect, the public 
has held the oil companies account-
able for damage to the waterways. 
These companies have both the cap-
ital and the manpower for such vigi-
lance, and their resources are far bet-
ter suited to the task than are there-
sources of any local agency. 
No one, least of all the companies

themselves, wants an oil spill. 
Though Hawley declined to state the 
cost of a clean-up, one source said it 
costs about $2,000 per hour. If this is 
correct, the New Haven spill costal-
most half a million dollars-a consid-
erable deterrent to everyone in-
volved. There are fewer deterrents, 
however, against another form of oil 
pollution, far more damaging in the 
long run, that takes place just be-
yond the public eye. 
Each tanker that discharges its 
cargo in the northern states cleans 
its cargo tanks at sea on the way 
back to the Gulf of Mexico or the 
Caribbean, dumping the waste over 
the side. The practice is illegal, but 
virtually impossible to police. The 
ecological implications of this abuse 
far outweigh those of a small spill 
in New Haven, but because it occurs 
offshore it continues unnoticed or 
ignored by the public. 
Small boats also contribute a large 
percentage of the oil pollution in the 
sea. It seems unlikely, however, that 
government will attempt to control 
the pollution by small craft.in the 
same way it atte~pts to regulate 
that by ocean-going vessels. Yachts-
men would never consent to this in-
terference, yet are often the most 
vocal critics of the oil industry. 
The public's insatiable appetite 
for petroleum products puts great 
demand on the shipping industry, 
increasing the likelihood of acci-
dents. Reducing consumption would 
mean reducing pollution, and the pro-
bability of oil spills as well. But it is 
much easier, it seems, to affect out-
rage at the accidents, demand they 
be fixed, then continue intentional 
pollution as if all is well. A life style 
is harder to fix. 
New Haven once had a superb re-
source in its harbor. Many people 
made their living from the rich oys-
ter beds there, and much of commun-
ity life centered around jobs andre-
creation connected with the sea. Pro-
gress and industry have taken their 
tolls, and now the interstate highway 
separates the harbor from the city. 
The beach near Long Wharf is 
strewn with garbage, and industrial 
waste and sewage flow into the har-
bor. 
A few signs indicate that New 
Haven; like Boston and San Fran-
cisco, is beginning to rediscover its 
harbor by renewing waterfront com-
munities and cleaning the water it-
self. A new restaurant will soon open 
on the West Haven shore, and Mor-
ris Cove- on the eastern side of the 
harbor- now has a marina which of-
fers public sailing lessons. But the 
improvements do not touch the 
blighted industrial section of the 
harbor. 
The recent spill will no doubt dis-
courage developers from settling 
along the shore. Although the clean-
up succeeded this time, the prospect 
of another spill under less fortunate 
circumstances appears all too real. 
It could cancel out years of planning, 
and reverse whatever gains might 
have been made in the fight against 
industrial pollution. The scenario is 
disheartening, and it partly explains 
why New Haven people care so little 
for their harbor. 
The ironies are painful. The public 
demands an entire clean-up industry 
be invented to handle accidents, yet 
tolerates and commits intentional 
pollution. The New Haven oil spill-
a model of concern and cooperation 
by the industry-received wide-
spread coverage_. then was quickly 
forgotten. The "perfect spill" was 
cleaned; the more difficult crises re-
main. It may be that the current 
economic value of the port is worth 
more to the city than clean water and 
a living waterfront community. Yet 
it is clear that a more thoughtful 
approach not only to New Haven 
harbor but to all our waterways is 
essential unless we are prepared to 
choke in our own over-consumotion. 0
