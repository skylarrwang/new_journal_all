**On the "New" American Writing, and Other Matters**
**Author: Joyce Carol Oates**
**Page number(s): 15**

(continued from page 2) 
an odd but typically American par-
A;" ochialism: an inability to realize that 
there have been many historical 
precedents for what is called the 
"new" American writing-Dadaism, 
the post-war French writers, not to 
mention Gogol and his descendents, 
and the ingenue tradition of 19th 
century American writing, especially 
of the frontier. A reasonably well-
informed writer of the present day 
chooses to write in a tradition and is 
not forced into one; the options are 
many, but those who choose to ex-
plore the possibilites of human con-
sciousness are hardly to be ranked 
as "less intellectual" than those who 
are following the anti-psychological 
tradition of the "new" French writers 
(who are hardly new in the 70's). 

A mP.ric.ans are often stmused 
to hear that in Red China, many 
people believe that the assembly line 
was invented by Chairman Mao 
sometime in the 60's-just so it is 
amusing to hear, from undergradu-
ates, that something radically "new" 
and "innovative" has just come 
along, a new American consumer 
product, without history. Charles 
Newman, editor of Triquarterly, has 
summed up this myopic spirit suc-
cinctly: "Nothing like us ever wuz." 

You ask what the "total" vision of 
my work might be: There is none, 
nor can there be any. There is no 
"total" of Barth's work either. (And 
how could your seminar have 
summed it up?-have you really read 
all his books?) Of course a hack writ-
er for an encyclopedia, or a student 
pressed for time on an examination, 
can sum up all of Faulkner in a sen-
tence- all of Hemingway in a cliche-
·~ but these are the usual lit. crit. word-
• 
bubbles, nothing more. Cartoon-bal-
loons arise from earnest, clever faces, 
meant to impress listeners with the 
intellectual depth of the speaker. But 
who is impressed, except those who 
would believe anything? 

Much of the literary judgments I 
encounter are no more than vapor. 
There is a considerable difference 
between intellectual posturing and 
intelligence; why the academic rou-
tinely admires the former, and is irri-
tated by the latter, I have no idea. 
Too much idle time, too much afflu-
ence? But even a pure, unsolipsistic 
rationality has its limitations; as 
Whitehead said, "The function of 
Reason is to promote the art of life.'' 
No one could have put it more beau-
tifully. 

The ceaseless questioning of real-
ity is, of course, exciting when it 
leads to action-on a personal, or a 
political level. Or when it allows an 
evolution of one's vision. But the 
pseudo-problems, the pseudo-state-
ments, the pseudo-inquiries I often 
\ encounter (not just at Yale, of 
course) are only vaporous manner-
isms, ways of filling time. I am not a 
Buddhist, but surely the Buddha 
was correct-many centuries before 
Wittgenstein, even Kant-in point-
ing out gently to a disciple that his 
questions were largely meaningless. 

And yet dangerous: because they 
engage the intellect in silly, ceaseless 
activity, and draw one's attention 
away from direct experience, from 
the eternal-in-the-temporal, from 
what orthodox believers call God and 
others call simply the creative exper-
ience of the world, the activation of 
the objective psyche. I was asked 
why I write-which must be trans-
lated as a question relevant to all 
people, to everyone who attempts 
communication in any way. It is 
really a religious inquiry, at bottom, 
and takes one's entire life to explore: 
Why do I exist? Why do we all exist? 
What are we doing here in this place? 
As Yeats said, man can embody 
truth but cannot articulate it-it is 
experience, not to be reduced to 
verbal shorthand.

**Polite Applause**
**Author: John Ellis with Naomi Pierce**

Polite applause 
The flood lights from the TV camer-
as bathe Jane Fonda's face. The Yale 
Daily News board room is baked and 
musty. From where I am standing, I 
can see her hands tremble as she 
brushes her hair back. Her voice is 
hoarse and it quavers, but she re-
sponds aggressively to questions. 

Ms. Fonda does not tolerate inter-
ruptions-"Please, will you just let 
me fmish," she says. Her message is 
worthy, her diction incisive. She is 
an actress, yet it is still somehow 
shocking to discover that her pas-
sionate appeals-the words that 
seem to rush to her lips-are memo-
rized like lines. They appear verba-
tim in interviews (Playboy and Rol-
ling Stone). 

That night she speaks to the Yale 
Political Union, and the words are 
still largely true. The Indochinese 
War is "still America's war." The 
funds allocated by Congress for the 
Food for Peace P.rogram are being 
used for military purposes. The 
political oppression in South Viet-
nam is atrocious. And so on. 

But what is eerie about her speech 
is not the repetition-it is. the sense 
that almost no one cares anymore. It 
is an indication of how far we've 
gone. The country is wired into a sur-
vival trip now, half crazy with fear 
about the grim slide towards eco-
nomic collapse. The last thing any-
one wants to !).ear about is Vietnam. 
It brings back too. many painful 
memories: the light-at-the-end-of-
the-tunnel peace, getting stomped in 
Chicago, Billy Ray blown to bits in 
An Loc. Most of us are doing our 
best to forget. 

So Jane Fonda speaks into a vac-
uum. There is polite applause as she 
walks up to the altar in Battell Cha-
pel. She delivers a speech which is 
the same speech she has delivered in 
countless other cities across the 
country. Again there is polite ap-
plause. Ms. Fonda takes five or six 
questions from the audience (maybe 
250 strong) and answers them as she 
has for countless publications. One 
watches all this as one watches Carl 
Yastrzemski taking batting practice. 
It is all so matter of fact. There is a 
standing ovation and most everymte 
goes home. Ms. Fonda must attend 
another meeting. What she should 
really do is go over to the Depart-
ment of University Health and get 
some medicine for her throat, for she 
can barely speak. 

Ms. Fonda has been doing this 
sort of thing for almost five years 
now and one can only admire her per-
severance. It is a grim way to spend 
your time. All those hotels, strange 
faces, bad meals, ridiculous ques-
tions which she has answered so 
many times before, all of it so that 
she can lay on another audience one 
of the most fantastic bummers of the 
t-wentieth century. 

Why on earth does she do it? I 
haven't the slightest idea. Every-· 
thing I've either read or heard about 
her has never come close to explain-
ing this most obvious Question. 

Everything she says to the Political 
Union was said back in the middle 
sixties, and if the facts have changed 
somewhat, the ba.sic drifts are exact-
ly the same. Hearing about them in 
1974 only drives me into despair.
