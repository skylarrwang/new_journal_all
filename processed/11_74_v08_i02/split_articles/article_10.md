One man's view of the harbor 
Andy Panzo is short and fat, about 
fifty years old. He walks with a heavy 
limp, has a wart on his left eyelid, 
and a large diamond on his finger. 
His hands move in broad gestures 
when he talks, which on the job is 
less frequently than he would like. 
Andy Panzo is a tender of the Ferry 
Street Bridge. 
"Best bombshelter in New Hav-
en!" he says of the bridge tower, a 
massive stone structure built in 1940 
under the WP A. The living quarters 
consist of a small dark room with a 
couch, two chairs and a television. 
Panzo is rarely inside when the 
weather is good. 
"I've seen everything but dead 
bodies float under this bridge,'' he 
says. "Used to be we'd swim down 
here as kids. Back then you could see 
your feet in the water, and along the 
shore there"- he points to the east-
em shore of Quinnipiac River and a 
building with the faded words, 
BROWN SEED OYSTER-"used 
to be oyster houses. Used to oe an 
old lady, she'd run a coupla the 
places-! don'tmeanjustown 'em, I 
mean run 'em, shellin' the oysters 
herself." 
Oysters are no longer harvested 
in New Haven, because the harbor's 
polluted waters make them inedible. 
Some elements of the oyster com-
munity still exist-the shingle style 
homes along the lush slope down to 
the river, a few of the old piers and 
boats. But the oyster docks are di-
lapidated and the boats have been 
hauled and abandoned. The few re-
maining traces of the oyster industry 
are barely discernible on the river's 
shores, where oil tanks now set the 
mood. 
"The big boats," says Panzo, "the 
ones you have to raise the bridge for, 
they used to come through to the 
tanks on the shore until they got the 
pipeline in." The pipeline carries oil 
from the New Haven Terminal, 
where the tankers now unload, to 
tanks around the harbor. Like all the 
tanks, the ones near Panzo's bridge 
are large and round and have com-
pany names painted on them. They 
set the river off from the land, break-
ing the fragile interplay of forms. 
The river's edge has become a wall. 
If Panzo seems blase about the 
harbor and t~ pollution beneath his 
bridge,..it is because he suspects it 
does little good to care. He has lived 
near the harbor all his life, and has 
seen it change. Now there is oil and 
sewage and industrial waste in the 
water, and Panzo is resigned to their 
presence. He watches the water 
just closely enough to do his jo}?-
listen for the signal blasts, seal the 
roadway shut, pull the levers down. 
He does not work alone: two men 
tend the bridge for eight-hour shifts, 
one as flagman and the other as oper-
ator. Many of the other tenders are 
under thirty years of age, and Panzo 
cannot understand this. 
"No job for a young fellow," he 
says, "it's too damn boring. You 
think I'd be here now if I hadn't got 
laid up so bad?" Panzo worked on 
the road crew that built Interstate 95 
until a ditch he was digging caved in, 
burying him in rock and sand up to 
his neck. "I was laid up for three 
years until I could walk again. This 
is about the only job I could take af-
ter that."

The construction of the turnpike 
also left its mark on the life in the 
harbor. According to Panzo, the 
dredging for the turnpike bridge 
helped destroy the oyster beds. "I 
don't know that they could tell that 
would happen, but it sure did. Gov-
ernment came in afterwards and 
started pay in' for some of the oyster-
in' because the oyster men hollered 
so loud. They had a point, but the 
damage was done." 
His attitude toward the govern-
ment is more fatalistic than bitter; 
Panzo is a public employee. The de-
struction that progress brings seems 
somehow necessary to him, and, 
besides, the government can usually 
be counted on to pick up the pieces 
afterwards. He has his evidence-his 
job and the subsidized oyster indus-
try. Panzo looks at the turnpike and 
says, "When Uncle Sam foots the 
bill, time marches on." 
He has few complaints. He 
doesn't like to look at the harbor any 
more, but he knows it very well and 
its people know him. He is, in fact, 
somewhat of an institution judging 
by the number of horns that sound 
as cars hum over the bridge's steel 
grating. "Kids come out here from 
Yale all the time too, with their ca-
meras and notebooks," he says. 
Andy Panzo is tired of the harbor. 
He used to fish and swim there with 
his friends; now he avoids the water 
after work. When he talks about the 
present, he talks about apartment 
life and the team he coaches in the 
Little League. 0
