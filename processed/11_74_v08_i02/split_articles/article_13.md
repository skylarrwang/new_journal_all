to offend everyone on one level or an-
other. A common strain exists that 
demands a white, Christian, male, 
upper middle class background (with 
working knowledge of the flavor and 
fads of America from Korea to Viet-
nam) to fully appreciate most of the 
parodies in the magazine. But this 
small segment receives perhaps the 
cruelest and most incisive attacks, 
because it is the background Lam-
poon editors know best. It might be 
difficult for WASP's to enjoy Son-
0'-God comics, featuring the savior 
as a muscular super hero. 


It would be a mistake, however, to 
assume that neither criteria nor con-
trols lie behind the Lampoon's wild 
forays. If the magazine is grossly of-
fensive, and Kenney confesses that 
he personally finds "a certain a-
mount of it shocking," such material 
must be superbly scurrilous. It is, in 
Kenney's words, "tastelessness done 
damn well." A cursory comparison of 
the Lampoon with its collegiate imi-
tators and the ill·conceived Harpoon 
will support Kenney's claim. A noth-
ing's-sacred policy encourages the 
impoverished excesses that charac-
terize most of America's pitiful at-
tempts at black humor. The Lam-
poon rises above this morass. 


Beard and Kenney credit the Lam-
poon's legitimacy and excellence to 
former Art Directors Michael Gross 
and David Kaestle. Suffering at its 
birth from the misdirection of Cloud 
Studios, whose graphic designers 
sought to impart an "underground" 
flavor (i.e., Other, Rat, Freep, Barb, 
Seed-remember those, golden-
agers?) to the product, the Lampoon 
quickly sought out the talents of a 
designer who could impart the auth-
oritative stamp of slick, extrava-
gant, Chermayeff/ Glaser/Lubalin 
graphics and Avedon/Penn photo-
graphy to the magazine. Gross has 
done a superlative job in this role: 
parodies (like Psychology Ptoda.y) 
are as close as to be mistaken for the 
"real" thing (Volkswagen proved 
that point conclusively), and the ma-
gazine's own identity (a hybrid of 
jazz modern motifs and Esquire lay-
out) is distinctive and successful. 


" We should have remembered 
from our Harvard Lampoon exper-
ience," Beard notes (he and Kenney 
were chiefly responsible for the re-
markable Life parody -remember 
Life?), "but Michael had to teach us 
again: second-rate writing can be 
completely disguised by excellent 
graphic design." Examples abound 
to support this maxim. The Lam-
poon's own bestial version of Pent-
house, entitled Pethouse, features a 
basset hound named N ana as pet of 
the month. Nana's ga.ms are spread 
invitingly in one photograph, she de-
licately sniffs at her own feces in aJl· 
other. The merit of such indulgence 
is debatable. What is beyond argu-
ment is that the lavish design and 
the elegant, plumed surroundings of 
Nana's world provide a much more 
effective censure of Penthouse than 
any single example of feminist rhe-
toric. It is the designer's success. 


The only standards that Lampoon 
staff members obey are those that 
they impose upon themselves. The 
question of what might please read-
ers is not an issue. Some considera-
tion is given the degree to which the 
audience will apprehend the mater-
ial, but the problem of audience ap-
proval seems to trouble no one at the 
Lampoon. "Sex. will always sell the 
magazine," says Kenney. The Zits & 
Tits combo does move more Lam-
poons at newsstands, but who a-
mong those plunking down the price 
for the Strange Sex issue will empa-
thize with the wedding cake on the 
cover featuring a little plastic groom 
in the company of a little plastic 
sheep? 


'Well, if they don't like it, fuck 
'em," is Kenney's answer to negative 
reader response. "You have to go 
'ha-ha' when you read the maga-
zine," he says. "We must make the 
magazine funny. But we write about 
things to strike a nerve. That's what 
we're trying to ao. We're doing these 
things for shock appeal." The tra-
dition of slapping audiences into ac-
cepting (or, at least, considering) a 
moral message stretches back to 
Aristophanes and includes such 
heavyweights as Swift and Rabelais. 


The day may come when old Lam-
poons are considered suitable read-
ing material in geriatric wards and 
grade schools, but for the moment 
the Lampoon continues to earn the 
vituperative indignation for which 
Kenney and Beard seem to strive. 


In personal encounters, Doug 
Kenney and Henry Beard are most 
amiable and seem to suffer gladly the 
incessant questions (" When did you 
s tart it? Why do you do it? How do 
you get away with it?" ). But even a 
brief trip, in the company of fellow 
editor Tony Hendra, to address the 
Yale Daily News banquet in New 
Haven left no room to doubt their 
purpose and attitude. · ~You have no 
idea what contempt I have for all of 
you/' Kenney told the distinguished 
crowd. "And you have no idea what 
contempt you'll have for me after I 
vomit." The designer, Michael 
Gross, was not present to affect an 
emission of vomit onto the dais, so 
the humor was passed off as locker 
room genre, insulting but frivolous. 


Kenney did not strike an Achille's 
heel that night until he addressed the 
fact that the only black person a-
mong the ba.nquet's guests was 
Rudy Green, Yale football captain 
and recipient of a News athlete-of-
the-year award. In prefacing his 
spoof of Whiffenpoof singing style 
(the Whiffenfruits, as he called 
them), Kenney said that he was 
going "to honor perhaps the oldest 
and most famous of the singing 
groups, known and traditionally 
revered by Yale people and frankly, 
all the people here, with the excep-
tion of the one Negro. Sorry, Rudy. 
You know where it's at, and so do I. 
Kind of fun.ny-if you can laugh at 
it." The News's guests could not 
laugh at it. There were some emba-
rassed chuckles, but the prevailing 
reaction was one of silent, surprised 
anger. Kenney had snatched defeat 
from the jaws of victory-the au-
dience did not like the act. 


Beard was not disappointed by 
the performance, however. "If you 
leave a gathering of mediocre people 
like this without making most of 
them hate you," he said, "you'v~ 
missed a great opportunity." This 
comment, spoken aside as News 
staffers left the dining hall, bears out 
his fellow editor's (Kenney's) phi-
losophy-"if they don't like it, fuck 
'em. " 


The infamous Rudy Green remark 
bears on the touchiest of areas 
through which the Lampoon stam-
pedes, lights on and sirens flashing: 
prejudice. America may be ready for 
the true romance story of "First 
Blowjob" ; or Rodrigues's cartoons 
that cruelly mock the plight of the 
blind, the retarded and the crippled; 
or Tom Eagleton's address to the De-
mocrats: "Bree, bree, ga-ga-ga-ga, 
frip, znip, bzzzt!" But those Amer-
icans who read the Lampoon are 
usually not ready for the word 
Negro. It comes scathingly close to 
the fear of latent racism that per-
meates a liberal society that wants 
to deny the beast. One cannot make 
pious pronouncements about South 
Boston one moment and then laugh 
the next with the black and Puerto 
Rican cast of "All in de Fambly," 
wherein the family poses in silk 
smoking jackets, bathrobes and low-
cut dresses with dollar bills stuffed 
in the cleavage, surrounded by J &B 
bottles, cockroaches, rats, dice, and 
several color television sets. It is 
a troubling tableau for a liberal white 
reader: does one laugh because the 
portrayal is so outrageously wrong 
or because it is so outrageously 
right? Does the use of racism as a 
parodist's device help eradicate 
racism or does it serve to foster and 
prolong racism? 


The dilemma faced when dealing 
in stereotypes to attack stereotypes 
is evident in Kenney's words. For 
three hours, he has treated the New


--- Page 8 ---

Journal to glib answers-informa-
tive, to be sure, but easy. Suddenly 
comes a confession of uncertainty. 
"The race question is the most dif-
ficult thing for me to deal with in the 
magazine." 


"I don't know," he admits. "I 
guess all I can say is that we haue to 
do it. It's just a feeling that we have 
to do it. It's America's last taboo." 


Beard concurs: "We can't afford to 
go easy on anyone.'' The prospect of 
softening up their full-frontal attacks 
is more abhorrent to the editors than 
the criticism such attacks engender. 


• 'I have a lot of Jewish friends,'' 
Kenney continues, "so I'm much 
more sensitive to that issue. I don't 
have many black friends, there aren't 
many black staff members here at the 
magazine. All I can say is that I 
know of two reactions to • All in de 
Fambly.' One was a black guy who's 
very involved with trying to be 
white, and he was disgusted. Then 
there was a black woman who is 
really black, really secure, and she 
loved the piece." 


The Lampoon demands from its 
reader an acceptance of the hyper-
bollc perspective. If one is secure in 
one's personal identity and enlight-
enment, so this argument runs, 
black stereotypes do not threaten 
as much as they inform. Ultimately, 
nothing in the magazine profoundly 
shocks a generation weaned on presi-
dential assassination, urban riots, 
~nd televised Vietnam ("We'll return 
to the war after this word from Ana-
cin ... " ). This notion of a violence-in· 
ured populace is often used to justi-
fy the excesses of contemporary en· 
tertainment. The notion may be 
right: the National Lampoon, a bona 
fide mauler that sooner or later 
leaves everyone gasping in disbelief, 
is a certified marketing success. 


900,000 people paying one dollar 
each to be crassly assaulted and de· 
prived of every precious pretension 
is some kind of achievement. Can it 
continue? 


The Lampoon already seems to be 
standing in an increasingly solitary 
position. "We are now a threat," 
says B-eard. "When we printed the 
word 'fuck' in 1970, everyone was 
printing the word 'fuck.' When 
America had the Black Panthers, the 
National Lampoon seemed harmless." 


But the legendary Panthers have dis-
appeared and Bobby Seale is now a 
municipal politician. So while the 
forces of the Left are busy picking up 
the pieces, the Lampoon may in fact 
be all that remains. 


How can the Lampoon address its 
new·audience effectively? Doug Ken-
ney, class of 1968, is trying to speak 
to college freshmen of the class of 
1978. They are a different breed of 
student. "When I was at Harvard," 
Beard notes, "there was an unspo· 
ken understanding that some people 
had better things to do than go to 
class; they had come to Harvard for 
different reasons. I spent my life at 
the Harvard Lampoon, and still 
managed to graduate cum laude. 
Harvard understood that academic 
honors were for parents.'' Kenney 
summarizes the intra-generation gap 
succinctly: "You know what the best-
selling book on campus is today? I'm 
O.K., You're O.K. Can you believe 
that? I couldn't. Because I'm not 
O.K.!" 


Yet Kenney is doing very well by 
commercial standards. His position 
as an editor of the fastest-selling-
new-magazine-on-campus troubles 
him and epitomizes the nature of the 
Lampoon paradox. The editors pose 
as revolutionaries, but dream up an 
office building that would embarrass 
the most self-indulgent power-broker 
corporation. ''I'm comfortable my· 
self," Kenney tells us, "but I'm get-
ting sicker and more twisted every 
day." 


Such convolutions of spirit con· 
tribute to the malaise any humor 
magazine will suffer. Kenney asks us 
point-blank when we walk into his

office, "Do you think the Lampoon 
has gone downhill in the past year?" 


Perhaps it has. Energies have been 
drained by special projects: the 
Radio Hour and the 1964 Kaleido-
scope yearbook, the latter a particu· 
larly ambitious and admirable effort 
that has been graced with critical 
approbation and a second printing. 
The past year has seen the departure 
of Michael O'Donoghue, who, with 
Beard and Kenney, was one of the 
Lampoon's three muses, one of the 
forces who shaped the magazine's 
editorial approach. The Lampoon 
has suffered. 


And, after all, comedy is a serious 
business. One chokes on the cliche, 
but the big hoff machine must be 
constantly oiled. The Lampoon's re-
volving editorship policy tries to pre-
vent staff members from burning out, 
but even Kenney had to simply give 
up the routine for more than a year 
in order to function. 


In the Lampoon offices, cluttered 
informality seems to be the rule and 
cross-pollination the medium of com-
munication. Ideas are carried from 
room to room by word of mouth 
while proofs of upcoming issues cir-
culate to the accompaniment of can-
did reaction: "This isn't a great is-
sue, but there's some good stuff in 
it." Kenney asks Matty Simmons, 
chairman of the Lampoon's parent 
company, Twenty First Century 
Communications, to wait before he 
can conduct business. The reason: 
"Matty, I've got some guys from 
Yale here. This is important." The de-
cor is surprisingly subdued, but staff 
encounters seem to be made of 
friendly, facetious wisecracks. What 
happens when the ideas stop circu-
lating? 


"Parody. It's easy. It's popular." 
Kenney speaks of conceptual humor, 
"Original stuff is rare and it's risky. 
Our parodies are appreciated. Some-
times you can really fail with con-
ceptual stuff." Beard goes so far· as 
to say that the National Lampoon is 
parody, that the predominant image 
of the magazine is based on its uni-
que capability for mirror-like parody 
of comic books, hate literature, gov-
ernment publications, glossy maga· 
zines and even the S.A.T. The func-
tion, if not the purpose, of their ef-
forts is, in Kenney's words, "to ex· 
pose the tricks of the magazines.'' 


But derivative humor succeeds only 
as long as the reference is commonly 
understood. What else has the Lam-
poon to offer? 


"Excellent political satire, the 
best in the country,'' Kenney res· 
ponds. Political manhandling ex-
tends from the simple insult (Q: Who 
is Jerry Ford's favorite President? 
A: President Rushmore.) to the 
Lampoon's monthly review of .. News 
on the March." "News" is the first 
section a reader encounters. There, 
in New York Times Cheltenham 
type, the past month's events are 
presented with a deadly twist. The 
assassination of Franco's heir-appa-
rent is headlined with an homage to 
"The Man of La Muerta." The Lam-
poon observes the G.O.P.'s "sCandal 
Semi-Centennial" ( 1923-24/1973-74 ); 
so, too, Israel's celebration of Bomb 
Kippur! -TORAH! TORAH! 
TORAH! ran the headline. Chilean 
citizens bemoan Allende's overthrow 
in a caption coming from La Moneda 
palace: "Our beloved president is 
dead, the victim of a self-inflicted air-
strike. Also, he shot himself twenty-
seven times in the back with a 
machine gun from thirty feet away, 
pausing only once to reload.'' "News 
on the March" greets Ford's acces-
sion to the Presidency with "Demo-
cracy In Action! Ford Elected by 
Smallest Landslide in History. Un-
precedented Mandate: He Carries 
No States, Gets No Votes.'' Later in 
its resignation package ("They've 
Fired the Shit Heard Round the 
World"), the Lampoon reveals that 
several eleventh-hour strategies were 
devised to keep Nixon in office. 
Among them, Nixon dressing in a 
light brown suit and mailing himself 
to his wife at 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue. Pat would refrain from 
opening him and anyone trying to 
remove him from the White House 
would be guilty of a federal crime-
interference with the U.S. Mail. 


Future issues will emphasize pol-
itical satire. Beard has become in-
creasingly distressed by the un· 
checked advances of the giant multi-
national corporations. There is much 
new territory to be explored, parti-
cularly as the nation seems to be 
racing headlong into an econo· 
mic and political Goetterdaemmer· 
ung. The call to nostalgia (embodied 
in so many of their parodies) has run 
its course. "The yearbook was a 
great achievement," Beard says, 
"and the last of its kind. How much 
more nostalgia material can we pro· 
duce after that?" The editorial shift 
is under way. 


Kenney goes so far as to see the 
Lampoon as a muckraking journal. 
Kenney and Beard, the original team 
from Harvard, continue to control 
much of the Lampoon's policy. But 
if their perception of the world's 
aberrations as fodder for a humor 
magazine became transformed in 
other hands, the Lampoon could 
easily become a violent and ser· 
ious assailant. "News on the March" 
is commentary of the most sobering 
nature. 


They have become an establish· 
ment in themselves. The National 
Lampoon is the American Humor 
magazine: imitated, reviled, at· 
tacked and sometimes feared-but 
always noticed. Yet the iconoclasm 
shared by Doug Kenney and Henry 
Beard seems to guarantee that the 
Lampoon will not become a com· 
fortable, easy magazine that pulls 
punches and steers clear of contro· 
versy. There is too much delight to 
be had in sending the entire society 
up in elegantly constructed balloons 
and then blowing the balloons to bits 
with relentless, unmerciful attacks. 


For the present, several million read· 
ers eagerly share that delight. 


And in view of a culture that now 
seems to demand discretion, tact and 
compromise, how will the Lampoon 
respond to the increasing pressure to 
make itself more palatable and in· 
offensive? Henry Beard issues the 
answer and the challenge: "We will 
become even more outrageous.'· 


David Dunlap, editor in chief of the 
Yale Banner and freelance contribu· 
tor to the Minneapolis Tribune, is 
rumored to be a senior in Pierson 
College. Such reports, however, are 
largely unsubstantiated.
