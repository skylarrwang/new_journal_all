EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Film at Yale is an iceberg. Beneath 
the surface is a collosal tangle of in-
terests, needs, uses, ignorances, 
amazing talent left truncated and 
abused, great resources developed 
and wasted, high hopes, and a poc-
ketful of wait. Yale does not have a 
Film Department. Yet in the last 
eight years, I have seen the interest 
and activity in film increase at this 
University by spectacular propor-
tions. These gains have come despite 
the administration's unofficial policy 
of non-recognition. But several years 
ago, Yale finally realized that film 
was here to stay. 

One reflects on the screenings, the 
courses, the traditional battle of 
" Film is/is not deemed an appro-
priate course of academic study," 
the mythology surrounding the film 
societies, the love-hate relationship 
between the University and the film 
societies (the relationship is never a 
clear one), and the special events. 
It's very simple: today, everyone is 
affected by movies. The film medium 
is one of the most pervasive and sig-
nificant developments of this cen-
tury (witness the largest movie pro-
ducer in the world: the U.S. DeQart-
ment of Defense). We all grew up 
with film. Media trivia has practi-
cally become a national sport. 

While the importance and undeni-
able influence of film in modem life 
seem obvious-a " given" in any dis-
cussion ~f mass media and art-one 
of the major reasons for a hitherto 
non-commitment to film at Yale has 
been a longstanding faculty disbelief 
in film 's value. Fortunately, as a 
glance at the amount of film screened 
in "respectable" classes shows, this 
attitude is not quite as pervasive as 
it once was. 

Students actually can get degrees 
in film study at Yale, but they must 
first satisfy catches 1-36: that is, the 
course credits. The first twenty 
aren't hard to find, they are the ones 
that insure a liberal education along 
distributional guidelines; actual film 
courses are harder to come by. Get-
ting accepted into a film course at 
Yale is like trying to study in Bei-
necke Library with a ballpoint pen. 

For a long time, Standish Lawder's 
survey course (History of Art 68a) 
was the only game in town. At incep-
tion, its location in the History of 
Art Department was delightfully 
ironic: giving de facto recognition to 
film as an art form, a point contested 
adamantly by many faculty mem-
bers. Stan Lawder has been a one-
man film blitzkrieg at Yale; he de-
serves credit for the Griggs Collec-
tion, the Yale Film Festivals, film-
maker guests, lectures, Yale Film 
Associates (alumni interested in 
film), the Butch Cassidy premiere, 
and those precious few courses. And 
he still has time to "publish." 

With the advent of the College Se-
minar program, film courses began 
to appear in small but significant 
numbers. The reason, of course, was 
student interest. New courses were 
offered in criticism, filmmaking, and
