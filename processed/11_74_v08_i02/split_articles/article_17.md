Unfortunately, if you are a poli-
tical scientist or an historian and 
read Caro's book as a serious histor-
ical and political analysis, there is a 
great deal to quarrel with and to be 
disappointed by. In the first place, 
there are serious problems of fact. 
Again, if you are writing an epic it 
does not matter how bad the Augean 
stables really were. But if you are 
writing a careful analysis on public 
sanitation, it does. Caro repeatedly 
exaggerates the problems Moses 
faced, the feats he accomplished, and 
the ease with which he accomplished 
them (all three exaggerations are 
probably necessary, however, in 
building the case that Moses needed 
enormous power to do what he did 
and, gaining that much power, he 
became a public menace in a demo-
cratic society). 

One small example of the method: 
Caro discusses at considerable 
length the heroic task of keeping the 
sand at Jones Beach from blowing 
away. Moses is shown using an army 
of public works employees to plant 
beach grass on the sand dunes. The 
implication is that if Moses had not 
been such an extraordinary power 
broker and task master the whole 
project could never have been accom-
plished. The fact is that there are 
over two hundred yards of fine ocean 
sand at Jones Beach measured from 
the water to the bath house that is 
not protected by dune grass, and 
somehow it has survived from year 
to year without Moses's lavish atten-
tions. More to the point, public 
beaches have been created routinely 
up and down the Atlantic Coast by 
apparently ordinary engineers and 
planners. Many seem to persist with-
out help from anyone but the Com-
prehensive City Planner in The Sky. 

What is interesting about Jones 
Beach is that it was a pioneering ex-
periment designed on a grand scale 
and that it illustrated use ot govern-
ment power in the public interest. 
Caro makes this point, but much of 
the rest of his account of this and 
other facts lies in the realm of thea-
trics and the kind of breathless "you 
are there" journalism associated 
with the writing of Gay Talese. In-
deed, the book that in my judgment 
most clearly resembles Caro's is Tal-ese's account of the building of the 
Verrazano Bridge. The two books 
have a strikingly similar tendency 
to turn public works construction 
into the acme of human daring, ad-
venture, and skill. 

The main trouble with Caro's awe-
struck account of Moses's accom-
plishments is that he constaritly 
loses perspective. Not only have 
other cities and states built beaches 
without Moses but they have also 
built highways, bridges, and all the 
rest. What is more, the pattern of 
this urban cohstruction looks much 
the same in one city after another. 
Caro, the epic writer, tries to attri-
bute much of this national develop-
ment to the influence of Moses 's se-
minal ideas and experiments. But 
any social demographer or economist 
can tell you why the public works 
in our metropolitan areas take the 
form they did without conjuring up 
individual heroes and villains. 

If Moses were not the epic figure 
Caro depicts him as, what can we 
safely say abouthjm? He was surely 
determined, resourceful, and ruth-
less. He served in high levels of gov-
ernment for an unusually long time 
which in itself explains much of his 
impact. In his last years of service, 
he was clearly imperious and cranky. 
He had very important political al-
lies in AI Smith and LaGuardia, and 
they did much to make the Moses 
legend possible. He also obviously 
knew how to get things done-and 
how to use patronage in doing so. 
Caro seems to be shocked by Moses's 
use of under-the-table political tac-
tics and pay-offs. He should study 
public construction in other states 
(Maryland would be a good starting 
point). 

In general we can say that Moses 
won a number of political bat tles, 
but he also lost far more than Caro 
acknowledges. More t han anything 
else, Moses succeeded in becoming a 
secure feudal baron in the turbulent 
world of municipal and state politics. 
In this, he was like countless other 
police chiefs and chairmen of inde-
pendent boards and commissions. 
No doubt, he operated on a bigger 
scale, but he was playing the same 
game. City Hall (and the state gov-
ernment) could not easily get rid of 
him, and so they let him go about his 
business as long as his work com-
manded popular support and until he 
aroused intense opposition and be-
came a liability. Indeed, when the 
public mood turned against Moses, 
he quickly became the favorite scape· 
goat of John Lindsay and Nelson 
Rockefeller. And then all the con-
crete and patronage in the world 
could not long forestall his political 
.decline. 

My point is, that to understand 
Robert Moses we must look at the 
political context in which be worked; 
be was shaped by that context far 
more than be shaped it. My com-
plaint is that Caro refuses to put Mo-
ses in political context, since that 
would spoil the story. Thus Caro 
does not sufficiently underline the 
fact that Moses gained power in 
large part because he was providing 
a winning issue for elected public of-
ficials. Caro does not emphasize that 
there were no existing public 
mechanisms for doing what Moses 
wished to do. The city and the state 
were too fragmented in their organi-
zation to plan for large-scale public 
works. The job called for a centraliz-
ed administrative structure with 
some freedom from the political mar· 
ketplace. This is the same logic that 
led to the creation of the New York 
Port Authority and to similar public 
agencies throughout the country. 

What is more, it was (and is) re· 
formers who called for this kind of 
institution, capable of long-range 
planning and efficient business-
· like administration. 

To argue that Moses was himself 
responsible for creating dangerously 
centralized and unresponsive public 
institutions is to miss the forest for 
the trees. The fact is that there ap· 
pears to be an inevitable and trou-
bling tension between long-range 
planning (that is not subject to nar-
row political manipulation) and ef· 
fective democratic control. 

Finally, in evaluating Moses's ca-
reer, Caro fails to offer any convinc-
ing points of comparison or assess-
ment. He begins and ends with his 
focus firmly fixed on Moses, the fail-
ed prophet, the tragic hero. But how, 
we may ask, did Moses's record ac-
tually compare with public works in 
other American cities? Better, I 
think. How did his methods compare 
with the shamelessly corrupt deal-
ings of t he machine grafters and trac-
tion rings of the 19th Century? Far 
better, I am sure. How did his vision 
compare with other major public lead-
ers in recent American politics? 
Certainly, he bad extraordinary vi-
sion at first, better than most. And 
certainly, his vision became rigid in 
the end-not unlike that of a lot of 
public leaders. 

In the final analysis, the serious 
question posed by Caro's book is 
this: Can we blame Moses for the 
"fall of New York," and thus indi-
rectly for the apparent strangulation 
of American cities by the car and by 
the highway? We can if we wish to 
dismiss virtually every other major 
social. economic and political force 
that has operated in American cities 
in the post-war period. Otherwise 
not, I think. Curiously, Caro never 
honors Moses so much (and so un-
justifiably) as when he places 
Moses's personal power and will 
above that of an entire society. 

In short, in Caro's treatment, 
Moses is made into a god and, for ail 
his objections to the book, that prob-
ably pleases the old boy just fine. O
