ready been done in English, French, 
anthropology, American studies, 
and sociology courses. Film study 
is no gut; it just looks that way 
sometimes because it's fun. 

The prospects for original film re· 
search (in any major field) are 
astounding. 

A great deal of film at Yale 
depends on the film societies. With 
four regular (Yale Film Society, Yale 
Law School Film Society, Berkeley 
Film Society, and Ezra Stiles Film 
Society) and a dozen occasional 
groups operating (including depart· 
mental series and the Branford Film· 
makers), there is an incredible 
amount and variety of film screened 
here, more so than at schools with a 
heavy official commitment to film. 

In addition to screenings, the film 
societies have underwritten a num· 
ber of other film activities and events. 
Again, money is always a problem. 
Contrary to popular belief, the Yale 
Film Society and the Yale Law 
School Film Society receive no finan-
cial support from the University. 
The Berkeley College Film Society 
receives only limited support from 
Berkeley College. All the film groups 
operate on a non-profit basis. And 
despite the long lines at the ticket 
counters, nobody is raking it in. The 
ticket receipts of the Law School 
Film Society are used almost entirely 
for operating expenses, special 
events, new equipment and film· 
making grants. 

Essentially, film groups are left to 
run programs on their own. For 
years, Yale carried out a policy of 
benign neglect, occasionally arbitra· 
ting disputes, but hoping not to be 
bothered by the whole thing. For· 
tunately, the film societies prefer to 
cooperate rather than to compete. 
Competition would result in a losing 
situation for everyone, especially the 
audiences. The distinct danger with 
so many different groups running 
shows is that the "pie" of audience 
financial support will get spread too 
thin to allow certain kinds of worth· 
while but less profitable programs to 
be shown. Some of this has already 
been felt, and the overall film pro· 
gram has suffered in recent years 
because of it. 

Screenings have not always been 
as abundant as they are now. The 
first film series at Yale was held in 
the fall of 1935, totally underwritten 
by one undergraduate. There were 
ten filpls, and about fifty people at· 
tended regularly on a subscription 
basis. Film was regarded then as 
something unclean. Ironically, in the 
1920's Yale had produced (i.e., 
funded) some high·budget·for·the-
times documentary films, a series 
called theY ale Chronicles of Amer-
ica. They dealt with large-scale re·

constructions of scenes from Ameri· 
can history, and were used as educa· 
tiona} films as late as the 1950's. It 
was an incredibly sophisticated, high 
quality operation 

For years, films were shown spo· 
radically at Yale. In the early 
Sixties, theY ale Film Society gradu· 
ally established itself as a regular 
series, mostly on Fridays and Satur· 
days. In the mid-Sixties, screening 
time expanded to Tuesdays, when 
silent films were shown largely in 
conjunction with Standish Lawder's 
course. In 1968, in response to in· 
creasing student demand, an Ameri· 
can Film Series was added on Wed· 
nesdays and Thursdays. At the same 
time, the Yale Law School Film Soci· 
ety established its series on Sundays 
and Mondays, and inaugurated a 
policy of special events-bringing 
directors and other film profes· 
sionals to the campus. The Yale Law 
School Film Society has had Sam 
Peckinpah, Robert Altman and 
Fritz Lang, among others, bring 
t heir new films toY ale. The growth 
of film showings culminated in the 
early Seventies with the proliferation 
of residential college film groups, 
after which it levelled off. Now, the 
Yale community has a unique oppor· 
tunity to see a wide of variety of 
film, something the University 
should be proud of-and which it 
should maintain. 

Another unsung hero in the brief 
history of film at Yale is Charles 
Lewis, director of the Yale Audio 
Visual Center. Virtually all media at 
Yale depends on the efforts of Lewis 
and his staff in spreading the limited 
resources of the University as far as 
they will go. It is embarassing to 
note how ill-equipped Yale is in 
terms of basic equipment and facili· 
ties. a fact t hat professors in need of 
various equipment discover with in· 
credulity. Cameras and editing 
facilities are constantly overbooked. 
It is a testament to the talent of the 
people at Audip·Visual that media 
life at Yale goes on at all. 

The question remains, does Yale 
have a commitment to film? It's like 
asking the Magic 8-Ball. Whenever 
you ask an important question, the 
answer that swims into view is • • Reply 
hazy, try again later." If the funds can 
be found, this response can be amended 
to "Signs point to yes." 

Meanwhile, the Yale College 
Dean's Office, on its own, recently 
organized a screening of Renoir's 
Rules of the Game. There is hope. 

Support your local film society, 
and tell Robin Winks he is missing 
something. Movies are adventure. 
Hope you enjoy the show. O
