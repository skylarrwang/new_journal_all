**Title:  New Haven Terminal**

teTJ ina/ 
represents one of the largest and finest trans-
shipment facilities in southern New England 
today. It coordinates full transfer and trucking 
operations including: (a) modern pier berths 
(b) stevedoring for all types of cargo, (c) ship's 
agent service, (d) warehours and open storage, 
(e) export and import handling, and (f) a uni-
fied trucking service throughout southern New 
England. 

Today the Terminal maintains three major berths 
affording 35' M'L 'W' at a 650' pier and a quay 
with shipside rail. With these facilities . and with 
New Haven Harbor's 35' deep water channel, the 
largest freighters and tankers of normal draft in 
use today can be acoomodated. 

The Terminal's many acres of open storage, and mil-
lion cubic feet of (dry pipe protected) warehouse 
space are served by spurs which connect directly 
with the Penn Central main line to Boston and 
New York, Hartford -Springfield-Worcester line, 
etc. Motor line connections and trucks benefit from 
the new Connecticut Turnpike, (New England 
Thruway or Interstate 9 5) Exit 49 of which is less 
than 500 yards away, and which leads almost im-
mediately to Interstate Route 91 .
