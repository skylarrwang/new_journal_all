Tastelessness Done Damn Well 
by David W. Dunlap 
"I'd also like to take this opportuni-
ty to make a brassiere out of a hand-
kerchief. It's something we usually 
save for special occasions like this. I 
did go to Harvard, and you can 
understand how I'd like to pad out 
the time. Thank you and fuck you." 
Is this any way to address the for-
mal banquet crowd assembled to 
mark the transition of power at the 
Oldest College Daily? Well, boys and 
girls, it sure is if your name is Doug 
Kenney, senior editor of the fastest-
selling-new-magazine-on-campus. 
The National Lampoon's message, 
carried at our newsstands, in our the-
atres, over our public airwaves, on 
our phonographs, and within the 
privacy of our very own bedrooms is 
this: the best way to express outrage 
is to be outrageous. 
The magazine's tribute to African 
famine is a cover photo of a molded 
chocolate Sahel baby, complete with 
distended stomach, empty food bowl 
and a nice, big, juicy bite taken out 
of its head. President Kennedy is 
seen asking Governor Connally, "My 
insurance company? New England 
Life, of course. Why?" as a tiny 
figure in a distant building window 
prepares to open fire. P'Eggs are of-
fered for sale: pantyhose for women 
whose legs are missing. A special 
contest entitled " Forgotten, But Not 
Gone" rewards the reader who comes 
closest to guessing the date on which 
Mamie Eisenhower will die 
(presumably, the contest is still on). 
A treatise is offered on America's 
greatest Jewish presidents featuring 
a Mount Rushmore monument 
equipped with extra structural brac-
ing to support the weight of the pres-
idents' enormous noses. 
And who is left to safeguard the 
moral fiber of our country? The 
Lampoon artists catch the Supreme 
Court off-guard, in the midst of pon-
dering the obscenity issue. Mr. Jus-
tice Rehnquist, bedecked in Frederick-
of-Hollywood style brassiere and 
panties, is whipping a supine young 
woman who wears nothing but a pair 
of leather boots that the Chief Jus-
tice is licking. Mr. Justice Black.mun 
is found fondling the sexual organs 
of a mature kangaroo, while Mr. Jus-
tice Marshall gazes up at a naked boy 
perched upon a bench, to the obvious 
pleasure of Mr. Justice Douglas-
the very picture of avuncular licen-
tiousness. 


Clearly, there are no standards of 
taste operating within this editorial 
framework. The only discretion is 
that imposed by the Lampoon's le-
gal staff. Most frequently, such con-
trol touches on infringement of copy-
right. It is one thing to propose 
that Richard Nixon and his lieuten-
ants were a group of neo-fascist drag 
queens ("Boys in the Bund" finds 
John Dean advising Dixie Nixon: 
"Listen, Miss Landslide, there are 
some very icky things around that 
are going to need a cover-up. And I 
don't mean your crow's-feet!"). It is 
quite another thing to print a letter-
perfect parody of a Volkswagen ad 
(capitalizing on the Bug's sealed 
chassis and its ability to float on 
water), proposing in the copy that 
"If Ted Kennedy drove a Volks-
wagen, he'd be President today." 
The ad looked too genuine, readers 
mistook it for VW authorized copy, 
and Volkswagen of America sued for 
$500,000. The National Lampoon 
never paid, but withdrew all remain-
ing copies of the magazine with the 
offending add and printed a public 
apology. Co-founder Henry Beard 
points out that "the First Amend-
ment has nothing to do with copy-
right law.'' 

Where the lawyers do not inter-
fere, however, the editors declare 
open season on everyone. And to 
their own amazement ("We weren't 
surprised-we were completely as-
tonished,'' says Beard), the mag-
azine is a commercial success, phe-
nomenal in a period when most per-
iodicals seem to be last-gasping their 
way to extinction. Sandwiched be-
tween extravagant four-color adver-
tisements for the latest, most expen-
sive stereo equipment and record-
ings, the Lampoon's wicked world-
view now sells 900,000 copies a 
month (second only to the formid-
able Playboy in college campus cir-
culation). 

The editors are hard-pressed to 
reconcile this modern marketing mir-
acle tale with their own unflagging 
efforts to alienate every portion of 
America.n society. Such a paradox is 
reflected in their Self-Indulgence is-
sue: a magazine dealing almost ex-
clusively with the editors and writers 
of the Lampoon. In the issue, plans 
are unveiled for the N atLampCo 
Building. In the style of 1930's de-
cadent monumentalism, the building 
rises to 1071 floors and contains its 
own indoor sea, ocean-going ship 
harbor, airport, steeplechase, and 
blimp docks. Elsewhere in the maga-
zine, however, noting that revolu-
tionary heroes of the past have fallen 
by the wayside, dead, or co-opted, 
the Lampoon editors claim that 
"When it comes to revolution ... we're 
all you've got left." 

Boasting inheritance of the revolu-
tionary mantle might seem ill-found-
ed to readers who remember the "Re-
volution" of the late 1960's. The 
Lampoon's cause is unilateral-it 
makes no attempt to appease the 
sensibilities of the Left, and its over-
kill portrayal of racial, ethnic, na-
tional and sexual stereotypes offends 
those who propose to eradicate such 
stereotypes. The Lampoon sends 
Nancy Drew off on "The Case of the 
Missing Heiress." In the course of 
her investigation, Nancy overhears 
the SLA plot out its demands: "Tic-
kets to all Athletic home games." 
"An' a free two-toned Caddy-lak fo' 
de away wunses." "Cinque!" "Yo' 
welcome!'' 

But to the men who carried the 
Harvard Lampoon tradition to na-
tional audiences, the issues were ne-
ver expressed as left vs. right. As 
Cantabridgians, they learned an us 
v&. them ethic. Kenney ('68) and 
Beard ('67) were exposed to too ma-
ny hypocrisies on either side of the 
spectrum. For Kenney, the telling 
moment was the draft counselor who 
belonged to the Progressive Labor 
party. Kenney found it difficult to 
understand how objective a PL mem-
ber's advice would be to bewildered 
draft-age students. The inconsisten-
cies, foibles and deficiencies of the 
New Left provided ammunition 
enough for a good skirmish-throw-
ing in the mediocrity of middle 
America (June Allyson's guide to a 
boring lifestyle; Liz Taylor & Dick 
Burton's tacky gift catalogue with 
J .F .K. toilet seats and pet Koala 
bears-"Kick 'em, punch 'em-they 
won't squeal!"), and the crypto-fas-
cism of the conservatives (a headline 
screams "Chile's Back on the Menu. 
ITT's All Over For Allende."), pro-
vided enough ammo for all-out gue-
rilla warfare.

One of the more subtle myster-
ies of the Lampoon formula is read-
ership appeal. Unlike its contempor-
aries, the Lampoon caters to no one's 
taste. Such a message is clear in the 
editorial policy: there is surely suf-
ficient material in almost any issue
