"Most of my semester was devoted to job interviews," said George Frankel, a second-year law student at Yale, "and it was far too much." 

For second and third-year Yale law students, the fall search for summer and full-time jobs with law firms can take up as much time as classes; often it is of greater interest. It's a long, tiring process, stretching from September to December, with weeks of interviewing out of town. 

Next year, the law school faculty will try to limit the interview season to two weeks of the fall . But few students are enthusiastic about the idea. 

Last year 600 law firms applied to send lawyers on-campus to recruit the 350 second and third-year Yale law students, but the law school had space for only 400 over the four months of interviewing. The jobs pay well, up to $900 per week in New York and Los Angeles. And the firms pay students' travel, meal, and hotel expenses for second interviews, called "call-backs" or "fly-outs." 

"Everyone gets a job," said law school Dean Harry Wellington. "I mean, everyone gets a job. That's just the way it is." 

The long interviewing season was an annoyance to most law students. Yale law students averaged twenty on-campus interviews each last fall, according to Associate Dean James Zirkle. And many students interviewed for jobs in more than one city, taking as much as two weeks off from school to travel to call-back interviews. 

But the psychological strain of the interview season grated harsher on law students' lives. Waiting to hear whether firms would grant second interviews, and then waiting for a job offer, could be painfully tense times, especially for the student who received multiple rejection letters before ever getting a positive response. And at school, students were constantly reminded of their job search by the stream of peers in conservative business garb. 

"When anyone sits down in the dining hall in a three-piece suit, the focus immediately turns toward interviewing, and it's hard to avoid the conversation," said Frankel. 

"It's most oppressive in the bathroom, where you see the kids changing. It's so much a show," said third-year student Laura Potter. 

Still, most students saw the interview season as the best solution. Students have a lot at stake, both money and careers, and the extended interview season provided some security. 

"I wasn't dissatisfied with it," said second-year student Bennett Spiegel. "It's the kind of thing where you kept on going until you got something." 

"I found it long and straining and I also found it worked pretty well," said second-year student Eugene Illovsky. "I don't see why people presuppose that because the interview season put a strain on students, that it's something that they shouldn't have to go through. Students can presumably decide whether they want to go through it or not." 


In December, by a two to one vote, the law school faculty took that decision out of students' hands. Next year's fall semester will begin one and a half weeks earlier than in previous years. In late September, students will submit a list of firms with which they want to interview. During one week in October, classes will not meet, and law firms will be assigned rooms at the Holiday Inn for interviewing. And the Thanksgiving vacation, formerly only two days, will be a full week to be designated the official call-back period. 

The faculty had been discussing for several years the possibility of altering the interview season. What finally motivated them, according to Dean Wellington, "was the concern that students were engaged over an extended period of time in the interview process, and that this led to a lack of engagement in the classroom experience and the educational process during the fall term." 

"The students had it very much on their minds," Wellington added. "Any day they had an interview, that was all that they were involved in." 

Some students agreed. "It was very annoying that students were so obsessed with getting jobs last semester, and it really detracted from the academic atmosphere of the law school," said Frankel. 

But many other students voiced opposition to the job fair. The elected student representatives to the faculty presented a survey which showed that 148 of 169 students polled preferred the old interview season. The faculty, however, noted that the survey polled only one-third of the students and had been accompanied by a memorandum criticizing the job fair. 

"I think the bulk of the student body was indifferent," stated Dean Wellington. But in the eyes of student representative Mary Gay Sprague, "The faculty did what they did despite pretty strong student opinion against it." 

At the very least, noticeably few students spoke out in favor of the job fair. So even if the student body was indifferent, the decision was made by the faculty for the students. 

"The faculty here have a particular vision about the Yale Law School being a place that is extremely academic," said one second-year student. "They consider job interviewing to be dirty work that should be limited to as curtailed a period as possible. It's an interesting bit of paternalism." 

What continues to bother some students is that the new system won't affect the two aspects of interviewing which most interfere with academic life: anxiety of interviewing and time spent interviewing. 

Even with the job fair, students will still be thinking about jobs from September to December. "Getting a job is going to be just as much on everyone's mind," said second-year student Randy Styers, "and it's going to be as much a subject of conversation and worry." 

And it doesn't appear that students will spend any less time in the job search. Most class time missed in the fall is for call-backs. But the Thanksgiving call-back period includes only three business days, and, agreed Dean Wellington, "There's no way of policing call-backs." 

In addition, the job fair may actually increase interviewing. "You may have students interviewing with more firms at the job fair than they interviewed with last fall," suggested Dean Zirkle. "That would be partly a reflection of hedging bets, partly a reflection of anxiety the first time through a job fair." 

"I don't think it's going to substantially change the interference that recruitment has," admitted Dean Wellington, "but it's a step in the right direction." 

But many students feel that the job fair will be counter-productive. For example, noted second-year student Tom Distler, "It shortens the summer, which takes away money and also restricts splitting the summer between firms," which many law students now do. Wellington, however, said that since the faculty had been considering a fall break anyway, the job fair could be viewed as "a reallocation of vacation time." 

Another problem concerns students far more than it does faculty: the possibility that the job fair will make it harder for some students to get jobs. One student representative reported that some professors did not believe that any Yale student would have trouble getting a job. And one professor expressed doubt that a ten-week summer job could be very important. 

But the most qualified students have always gotten many job offers, while other students interview a lot and get only one or two. The job fair may worsen this imbalance. Because all interviewing takes place before any student gets call-backs, said student representative Randy Michelson, "people who would ordinarily drop out of the system early on when they get their offers will interview more than they need to." And if students don't get call-backs after their interviews, they will face the arduous task of finding a job on their own. 

"No one will be hurt if we can help it," promised Dean Wellington. "We'll make arrangements if individual students have problems." 

"Older students and students who have weaker academic credentials," said Spiegel, "are the ones who will pay the price." 

The job fair will be held next year, despite student criticism. The law school administration is sincerely devoting its efforts to planning and arrangements which it hopes will alleviate academic interference without disturbing success in the job market. 

But student pessimism was summed up by second-year student Nancy Thompson, who said, "I'd like to think that perhaps it will condense all the agony into one really unpleasant week, but realistically I think people will go outside the job fair format."
