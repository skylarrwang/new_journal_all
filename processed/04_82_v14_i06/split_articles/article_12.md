Wolfgang Leonhard teaches the largest class 
in the history of Yale. This year, the registrar 
had to reprogram the University's compwer 
to accommodate the 771 students enrolled in 
History of the Soviet Union. Leonhard's 
other classes, including the History of the 
International Communist Movement 
and several graduate seminars on Euro-Com-
munism and Soviet Foreign Policy, are also 
well-attended. 

But Leonhard is also in demand owside of 
Yale. Through a special arrangement with 
the University, he spends seven months a year 
in West Germany where he is a well-known 
commentator on the Soviet Union. He offers 
advice to firms and .trade unions, and often 
appears on television and in 'major West 
German newspapers and magazines. He also 
advises the West German Foreign Ministry 
and the political parties represented in the 
Bundestag on internal developments in the 
Soviet 
Union. 

His best-selling auto-
biography, Child of the Revolution, has 
been made into a movie which is often shown 
in West German high schools and univer-
sities. 

The child of two prominent left-wing in-
tellectuals, Leonhard was born in Vienna in 
1921. He lived in Germany with his mother 
until 1933. When the Nazis took power, 
they fled to Sweden and later to the Soviet 
Union where he continued his education. 
Leonhard am·ved in Russia on the eve of 
the Great Purge. One day, his mother jailed 
to meet him for an appointment. A note ar-
rived in the mail days later, telling him that 
she had been imprisoned. With the outbreak 
of the second World War in 1940, his father 
was put in a concentration camp in France. 
Leonhard worked for a Moscow radio sta-
tion during the war, making broadcasts in 
German to strengthen the anti-Nazi forces. 
He also attended the Commintern school for 
foreign Communists where he learned many 
special skills. Later, he would use this train-
ing to escape East Germany. 

When the Germans capitulated in 1945, 
Leonhard was one of the first representatives 
of the Communist Party to set foot in Berlin.

At age 24, he and several others known as the 
"Ulbricht Group• (after their le4der Walter 
Ulbricht) were given the task of setting up a 
government in Berlin. Once this task was ac-
complished, Leonhard became a kcturer at the 
High Party School "Karl Marx."' 

When the Yugosk:wwn Communists brok 
with Moscow in 1!148, 
Leonhard had 
already begun to have doubts about the Soviet 
system. In 1949, he kft East Germany. But 
he didn't go to the west. Instead, he went to 
Yugoskww, which was taking its own path 
to communism. The <kfection of a high party 
ojfidal received much attention. 

After migrating to West Germany, Leon-
hard became a graduate student at Oxford, 
where he wrote and researched The Kremlin 
since Stalin. In 1964, he gcwe his first kcture 
at Yale. Since 1966, he has been teaching at 
Yale each spring, and doing research, writing 
boolcs, and speaking in West Germany during 
the rest of the year. His books have been trans-
lated into nine languages. 
The New Journal: How did your own 
education contrast with that of the stu-
dents you now teach at Yale? 
Wolfgang Leonhard: Quite substan-
tially. I first studied at the Moscow 
State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign 
Languages in the English department 
in 1940-41 , i.e., under Stalin. The 
study plan was given to us up to the 
last minute. In all our main subjects 
including English literature, American 
literature, English history, U.S. his-
tory, and of course language, every-
thing was strictly along the party line; 
for all important English and Ameri-
can authors there was one standard 
evaluation sentence given to us which 
we had to learn by heart. Beginning 
from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales up to 
Jack London. 

TNJ: What evaluation did The Canter-
bury Tales get? 
WL: Chaucer was very much praised. 
H e was as much a "realist" as you 
could be in his time, and "realism" is 
as a whole seen as positive. 

TNJ: What was it like to have to flee 
your native Germany at age 12 when 
Hitler came to power and then to see 
your mother arrested by the Stalin 
secret police and your father being 
placed in a concentration camp in 
France? 
WL: I grew up in a time when a fate 
like mine was not an exception but sad-
ly enough rather widespread. Both my 
parents were left-wing inteUectuals and 
the brown shirts of the Nazi storm 
troopers were for me already a horrible 
sign when I was 10 years of age. When 
Hitler came to power in 1933, m y 
mother took me out of school. I didn't 
go to a Nazi school a single day in m y 
life. Five months later she arranged for 
me to leave Germany and go to 
Sweden. My father was in the mean-
time in emigration in France. My 
mother worked 
still 
clandestinely 
against Nazis until early 1935 then 
came to Stockholm where we met. 
From there in June 1935 we came to 
the Soviet Union. 
To what degree all of this has influ-
enced me I can't judge myself very 
much except of course that I became 
very much politically interested. Poli-
tics was not something far away and 
remote but a direct part of my life, an 
explanation for the threats I had to 
fear. 

\\ben my mother and I went to the 
Soviet Union I was at the beginning 
full of hopes. full of happiness that the 
terror of the Nazis were then over for-
ever. In September, 1935, I continued 
m y school education in the Soviet 
Union in a school in Moscow. It didn't 
take me long to realize that there was 
pressure there, too, maybe a different 
kind but obviously and clearly in exis-
tence. 

One year later the Great Purge 
began, the period where seven million 
people were arrested in two years; 
most of m y school mates had an ar-
rested mother or arrested father or 
m aybe even both parents were ar-
rested. My mother was arrested at the 
end of September, 1936, and I had to 
live now not only completely alone 
without a family but also in a situation 
where I realized, being at that time 14 
and 15 years of age, any wrong sen-
tence could mean a deprivation of my 
freedom and/or my life. 

The tremendous self-discipline not 
only in deeds but also in words and be-
havior became a second nature in m y 
life and was bound to stay for the next 
10, 12 years as long as I was in Com-
munist-ruled countries of the Stalin 
era. 

TNJ: How did these experiences influ-
ence your thinking? 
WL: How deep this impact goes is for 
the person in question very difficult to 
answer. The only thing that you can 
answer yourself is that the person who 
went through such dictatorial years 
with personal sacrifices knows and 
cherishes freedom of thought, of read-
ing, of discussion, much more than 
people who grew up in a society where 
all these things are taken for granted. 

TNJ: How did you and your comrades 
react to events like the Great Purge? 
Don't you tell stories about them in 
your class? 
WL: The people I mentioned (in m y 
class) were during the Great Purge and 
the famous show trials which I witness-

ed in the Soviet Union. With my 
friends we discussed these trials, and 
while we were then by no means oppo-
sitionalists of any kind, we didn't 
believe in thP. trials. We didn't believe 
that Bukharin (a top Party official 
purged by Stalin) wanted to assassinate 
Lenin or was an agent of foreign coun-
tries. So the discussions were not if you 
believe in it or not-we didn't-but 
why it was "necessary" to have it. 

TN.J: How did you react to that? 
WL: We tried to give better explana-
tions of why the Purges were neces-
sary. All of us knew that these people 
were revolutionaries who were not 
guilty but we tried to reconcile this 
with our belief systems and say why 
was it necessary to make it. Our 
understanding was, well, it's a difficult 
political problem, and you have to put 
it in those categories to make it under-
standable. 

T NJ : Was the fact that your mother 
was in one of the concentration ca.'Tlps 
of the Gulag for 10 years one t)f the 
reasons why you started to doubt 
Communism? 
WL: I don 't think that the arrest of my 
. mother during the Great Purge led me 
immediately to doubt Stalin's Com-
munism. At that time I was already so 
much indoctrinated that I refused to take 
individual cases as this was called in 
our belief system of that time a "start-
ing point to general conclusions." But 
on the whole, I think that the mass ar-
rests, the mass purges of the middle 
30s were the starting point of rethink-
ing certain aspects of Soviet develop-
ments. 

T NJ : How did Hitler's aggression 
against the Soviet Union and the 
Soviet war against the Nazis affect 
your own viewpoints? 
• WL: During the war years I was most 
likely more pro-Soviet than ever before 
in my whole life. The terrible danger 
of Nazi conquest was so great that 
everything else seemed not to matter 
any more. Besides the just struggle 
against Nazism the war years for me 
was combined with a great hope of an 
increasing collaboration of the Soviet 
Union with Britain, the United States 
and the other allied powers, and like 
many Soviet citizens at that time, I had 
the hope that gradually the victory 
over Na.zism, the victory of democracy 
all over the world would also imply a 
gradual liberalization in the Soviet 

T NJ : When you were 24 you came to 
Berlin with the "Ulbricht Group." 
Can you tell us what was it to have 
almost absolute power in a part of 
Europe where there was complete des-
truction, and in which the power of the 
Red Army was evidently absolute? 
WL: There were 10 of us, I was the 
youngest. We were not told the details 
of what we were going to do. The only 
thing we were told was that we were 
going on a special mission returning as 
the first German Communists to 
Berlin. 

We arrived in Berlin on the 2nd of 
May 1945, the same day when the last 
German troops capitulated in the city. 
From May to September 1945 was 
most clearly the most dramatic, inter-
esting and exciting period of my life. 
We were to build up and set into mo-
tion new local and city self-govern-
ments, install mayors, directors of fac-
tories, of enterprises, gradually rebuild 
the Communist Party of East Germany. 
I was at that time still so much influ-
enced by ideology that I thought we 
could do everything and decide on 
everything. I had no psychological 
scruples whatsoever. Today, looking 
back, I almost sweat remembering the 
kind of decisions I so easily took in
