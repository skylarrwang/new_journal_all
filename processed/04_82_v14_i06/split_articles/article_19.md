David Frum in his room. 
majority opinion to be a little more 
careful than it is, when it is the expres-
sion of uniform opinion. There ought 
to be somebody around to say, 'you 
just aren't intellectually honest."' Frum 
sees Yale as an essentially "non-
political" campus, where "people are 
liberal when they are political at all. A 
very small minority are left-wing 
liberals. Most of the people share the 
values of the rest of the country." For 
example, he feels students generally 
"support some measures of resistance 
against the Soviet Union. But no one 
at Yale in any open way is going to say 
anything against nuclear disarma-
ment." 

Uphampered by any such inhibi-
tion!, Frum opposed a Peace Con-
ference sponsored by the University 
Chaplain's Office in February. In the 
piece, he addressed participants in the 
conference who believe "the United 
States and the Soviet Union equally 
threaten world peace" and that "addi-
tions to the American nuclear arsenal 
make nuclea~ war more likely." By 
demanding that the American ~overn­
ment disar'r.l, these people are mcreas-

ing the likelihood of a Soviet military 
buildup and ultimately a "Soviet first 
strike," Frum wrote. At first, readers 
felt perversely satisfed when left-wing 
columnist Rob Glaser accused Frum of 
"distortions, misrepresentations, and 
lies." But after Glaser continued bat-
tering away at Frum, justifying his use 
of the word "lie" instead of justifying 
the essence of his accusations against 
Frum, those same readers began send-
ing letters to the editor in Frum's 
defense. 

Frum favors U.S. support to the 
Duarte regime in El Salvador to pre-
vent the revolutionaries from institu-
ting ''Marxist-Leninist totalitarianism'' 
in the Cemral American nation. Re-
cently Frum wrote, "What good will it 
do for the people of El Salvador or for 
American strategic interests to realize 
after we have lost in El Salvador how 
important it was, and how right it was, 
to win? America lost in Vietnam be-
cause its intellectuals could not bring 
themselves 
to 
believe 
the 
truth. 
America is in danger of losing in El 
Salv.ador for the same reasons,'' 
(YDN, March 23, 1982). 

Another of Frum's pet peeves is "the 
divestment people," students and pro-
fessors who don't want Yale to invest in 
companies that do business with the 
apartheid-practicing South African 
government. Frum has attacked their 
"mind-boggling hypocrisy" in a couple 
of pieces: "They're against Yale in-
vesting in South Africa, but don't seem 
to mind that Yale invests in all kinds of 
nasty authoritarian countries such as 
Burundi, Tanzania, the U.S.S.R." 

On several occasions, he also has 
criticized feminists for engaging in 
what he considers a similar kind of 
sloppy thinking. 
Last September, 
Frum condemned a march "To Take 
Back the Night" in which women from 
Yale and New Haven protested their 
inability to walk alone after dark 
without fear of rape. Frum's point: 
Crime, such as rape, is not an issue of 
concern only to women, but to all. His 
conclusion: The march would be "ut-
terly useless' because it failed to ad-
dress the broader problem of crime in 
the community. In response to the col-

umn, several students asserted in let-
ters to the Yale Daily News that Frum 
had "callously" ignored the possibility 
that rape is a "sexually motivated" 
crime against women, and that he 
overlooked the effect a large number of 
women gathering in protest might 
have on local crime prevention. 

Frum's stand on feminism stems 
from his conviction that the family is 
"the most important institution in 
society." He believes "the American 
feminist movement and the family are 
not compatible. 
While feminism 
became enormously powerful in the 
1960s, the family took a beating," he 
says. If the E.R.A. passed, he says, it 
"would remove any ability of society to 
pass protectionist laws for the family." 
Frum studied feminism last year in a 
Women's Studies course "Feminism 
and Philosophy." "I did it because I 
wanted to get the coherent argument 
behind the philosophy. Of course we 
did not. Feminism is a hodge-podge 
and medley of contradictory ideas. It is 
euentially a politically radical move-
ment." Here is where Frum truly plays 
devil's advocate. Frum opposes the 
E.R.A ., as well as organized feminist 
groups, but devilishly has neglected to 
tell his readers that he strongly sup-
ports equal opportunity for women; he 
also supports abortion rights. "I am 
less sexist than 98 per cent of the men I 
know. They believe in the E.R.A. and 
also helieve their girlfriend should 
sacrifice her career for them." 

Frum enjoys 
discussing the 
Women's Studies Couse, in which he 
was one of the four men enrolled. "The 
professor was Carol Donovan. I calJed 
her Professor Donovan. Everyone else 
called her Carol. I loathe calJing pro-
fessors by their f1r1t names because it's 
pretending you're in an egalitarian 
relationship when you're not. It shows 
a lack of respect and good manners." 

Frum• manners are beyond

reproach. At Yale, he hangs around a 
handful of intellectuals in Ezra Stiles 
College, with whom he might be found 
discussing Proust (whose entire oeuvre 
he's read "in English in the old transla-
tion, half in the new English transla-
tion, and half in French.") He also 
finds time to organize and engage in 
debates as the President of the Yale 
Debate Association. His debating skills 
are 
evident 
in his 
characteristic 
glibness and poise. "In the fall of 1980, 
I was one-half of a team (the other half 
was Steve Weiner '81) that beat Har-
vard, at Harvard, for the ftrSt time 
since 1950. The topic was 'Resolved: 
Liberalism Will Rise Again.' We 
argued the negative.'' 

Born and raised in Toronto, Frum 
grew up in an "extraordinarily happy," 
"superficially 
liberal" 
family. 
His 
mother is a successful television inter-
viewer- the 
Barbara Walters of 
Can ada- and 
his 
father 
is 
a 
businessman with a world-famous col-
lection of African art. In high school, 
Frum was School Captain, a Toronto 
equivalent of president of the student 
government. He also was a hippy 
radical. In his high school yearbook 
portrait his hair was long and his eyes 
wild. He now refuses to discuss his pre-
Yale days at much length, but former 
high school classmates say he belonged 
to an artistic set and had a fascination 
with drugs. He sobered up at Yale. "I 
wore a tie every day sophomore year." 

A combination of forces shaped his 
political views at Yale. "Directed 
Studies, which I was in freshman year, 
is a program that says these ancient, 
musty books are of enormous value. 
Also, whatever political statements 
people made auU)ma.Jicaliy freshman 
year were liberal. If you were bothered 
by rote statements, it drove you to the 
right. And Yale itself is imbued with 
tradition. You can loathe it or revel in 
it. Finally, there are a few conservative 
intellectuals at Yale. Eugene Rostow 
was my junior-year advisor. I met with 
him once a week for an hour last year. 
It was an exhilarating experience.'' 

Frum may be one of the only Yale 
undergraduates to be published in the 
New Yorker. The magazine, which often 
prints bloopers from other publica-
1 
tions, in February quoted a garbled 
paragraph from one of Frum's col-
umns, and concluded with the editor's 
note, "See us after class, Mr. Frum." 
Frum was not amused. "I was 
humiliated beyond description. It was 
read out loud in an introductory 
macro-economics class. I calJed home 
and told my father and mother about 
this thing. They laughed for about ten 
minutes." 

Frum will earn a combined B.A. 
and M.A. in history this May. His 
1 00-page senior essay concerns the last 
six months of the Vietnamese Republic 
and whether it fell due to corruption or 
lack of U.S. support. "'tis true that in 
the last year and a half, they didn't 
have enough bullets and bandages. It's 
the fault of the U.S. Congress. You 
could have had a free Vietnam for 
another 1.45 billion dollars." For the 
essay, Frum has conducted interviews 
with American public policy makers, 
several 
generals,_ historians and 
political scientists along the East Coast. 

Frum may be the News' most con-
troversial columnist in years. One 
reader, Michael Froomkin, '82, charg-
ed in a letter that Frum has committed 
J 
so many factual errors that the News 
editors should stop publishing his col-
umn. "At present, Mr. Frum writes

like a sawed -off shotgun. He can do far 
better, and should be forced to, or ask-
ed to find another market for his 
work,'' wrote Froomkin. 

News 
Editorial Editor Jacob Levich, '83, 
defended Frum. "Michael Froomkin 
has a number of interpretive and 
ideological disagreements with David 
Frum. That is his privilege. He has, 
however, failed to point out a single 
factual error in Mr. Frum 's columns." 

In another letter to the News, Sopho-
more Pam Harris called Frum "a 
master at the respectable art of subjec-
tive 
interpretation." 
In 
criticizing 
Democratic Senatorial candidate Toby 
Moffett of Connecticut, "Frum 
wrongly blames the Democrats for the 
U.S.'s economic problems, and over-
looks the Democrats' contributton to 
the civil rights movement," Harris 
claimed. "Mr. Frum has treated the 
reader to a history of the period from 
1964 to 1980 that is so limited in scope 
that it goes beyond subjective interpre-
tation and approaches reckless disre-
gard of historical reality,'' Harris 
wrote. "Mr. Frum relies on two 
devices to rewrite American history-
the misrepresentation of some facts, 
and the painfully obvious exclusion of 
others." 

Frum denies the accusations, claim-
ing his assailants fail to find inac-
curacies and simply disagree with him. 
He also concocts some of his own 
charges, primarily against arch-rival 
Rob Glaser, who writes a liberal week-
ly column "What's Left" and also co-
edits the editorial page. Frum recently 
accused Glaser of using the editorial 
page for ideological and personal ven-
dettas. "What concerns me even more 
than Glaser's bad taste.'.' wrote Frum. 
• 'is that he is converting this page into 
his personal soap-box. Glaser edits this 
page every other day. If he has e .. er 
printed a letter or column whose con-
tents were riot agreeable to him, I am 
unaware of it." (Glaser, of course, 
denies this.) 

Frum fears that students and pro-
fessors who read the Yale Daily News 
think he d islikes the U niversity. After 
all, he has taken an ad hominem ap-
proach in several pieces, criticizing the 
"dangerously radical" views of Univer-
sity Chaplain J ohn Vannorsdall more 
than once, and condemn ing A . Bartlett 
Giamatti for being hypocritical in last 
September's Freshman Address attack-
ing the Moral Majority. Says Frum "A 
lot of people think I'm a J eremiah rail-
ing away at everything at Yale. T hat's 
unfortunate. Despite the rid iculous 
things like th e Peace Conference, this 
University is of tremendous value. 
People here basically have their heads 
screwed on right, and will p robably 
become Republicans."
