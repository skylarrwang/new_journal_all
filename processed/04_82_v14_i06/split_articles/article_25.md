EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Woolston is studying the complex 
interaction of biological, social and 
psychological factors in the syndrome. 
What particular family situations pro-
duce these children, and can they be 
anticipated? Does the genetic 
predisposition of the baby matter, or 
can any baby be driven to arrested 
growth? Can NFTr be recognized 
bifore it produces the dangerous symp-tom of growth failure? 
"They're all good questions," 
Woolston laughs. "But they're a little 
premature." The first task, he ex-
plains, is to improve diagnosis. "We 
want to be able to distingush it from 
organic illnesses on positive grounds." 
P resently NFTr is diagnosed "by ex-
clusion," when no other disorder can 
be found. 


The problem of better diagnosis has 
been a central concern of NFTr 
research for years. What is special 
about Woolston's research is its com-
prehen sive "team" approach. Coor-
dinating a group of 16 specialists, in-
cluding physicians, psychologists, a 
social worker, a nutritionist and video 
technicians, Woolston leads a total in-
teractivist attack on a thoroughly in-
teractive problem. 


Though the research is still in an ex-
ploratory stage, the early results are in-
triguing. By videotaping the mothers 
playing with their babies, Woolston has 
started to expand the theory of a 
previous researcher who believed that 
NFTr infants prefer playing at a 
distance instead of the intimate cuddl-
ing preferred by most babies. When 
picked up and cuddled, some NFTT 
infants will arch their backs and hold 
stiffiy away from the mother, rather 
than rest easily on her shoulder. 


Woolston thinks this difficulty with in-
timacy may reinforce the child's failure 
to thrive by making feeding time un-
comfortable and thus preventing nor-
mal food absorption. Woolston has also 
begun to find that the infants will avoid 
intimate contact more strenuously with 
their own mothers than with hosptial 
nurses. What is the mother doing to 
earn this rejection? What emotional 
message is she transmitting? 


The family evaluation has begun to 
show that many of the mothers were 
raised in non-supportive, non-
nurturing environments, and they still 
often feel isolated and depressed. A 
majority of them have an extremely 
low opinion of their failing child. 


Often, the child was an accident, or 
unwelcome at birth; it's turning out 
'difficult' seems to have brought out the 
worst in the mother's anxieties. Some 
mothers think their child is ill or 
retarded, and feel disappointment and 
pity for it. Others think their child is 
"bad" and feel intense hostility toward 
it. 


The mothers are referred to Yale-
New H aven Hospital by pediatricians 
throughout Connecticut. When their 
infants are diagnosed for NFTr, they 
"react strongly," said Sylvia Laivetes, 
social worker on the Woolston team. 
"Some feel guilty and frightened at 
their inability to help their baby, and 
frequently 
they're 
glad for the 
hospital's help." Other mothers, 
Laivetes explains, including a surpris-
ing number who deny that their babies 
have any problem at all, feel anger or 
resentment and will vehemently object 
to the diagnosis of NF'IT because it 
seems to imply that they are at fault for 
the illness. 


Woolston sympathizes with the 
mothers' predicament, but he denies 
emphatically that there is anything 
malicious in the hospital's diagnosis: 
"It is not our thesis that the mothers are 
bad people," he says. "That notion is 
antithetical to everything we do, both 
diagnostically and therapeuticaJly." 


Some mothers of NF'IT babies have 
neglected their children, and many 
simply do not know how to care for 
them. Treatment for NFTT therefore 
involves not only hospitalizing the in-
fant for close observation, feeding and 
care, but teaching the mother how to 
provide that care. "Often the child has 
very special needs," Laivetes says. 
•society tells you it's easy to bring up a 
baby. You feed it, you sleep it, and it'll 
grow. Sometimes it just doesn't happen 
that naturally." 


Even for mothers who believe their 
babies will benefit from the treatment, 
consenting to the hospital protocol is 
often difficult. Woolston comments, 
"The hospital is a double-edged sword 
for them. If the treatment doesn't work 
then it's just another frustration, and a 
waste of their time. On the other hand, 
if the treatment W<JTics, if the child starts 
doing well in this strange environment 
and with these strange nurses where he 
would not do well at home, they feel 
terribly guilty. They take it as proof 
that they are bad mothers." 


It may be, however, that mothering 
is only part-and not the most impor· 
tant part-of the problem. Woolston 
has observed from others' research that 
the infants show a lowered level of the 
hormone 'cortisol'- a condition also 
found in adults with severe depression. 
Woolston suggests that NFIT babies 
may be suffering from a form of"infan· 
tile depression." The depression may 
be in part geneticilly;based, and may 
affect growth directly, or by exacer· 
bating the baby's relationship with his 
mother. 


But until doctors better understand 
the causes of the syndrome, effective 
treatment will remain difficult, 
Woolston says. Many babies now 
treated in the hospital must return for 
recurrences of growth failure and other 
developmental problems. "At the mo· 
ment, prognosis is pretty poor. But 
that is really not so surprising. Right 
now it's a little bit like medicine was in 
the 18th century. Diagnosis is so slow 
and sometimes confusing." 


Follow-up after hospitilization is im· 
portant to both research and treat· 
ment. "It is essential that the mother 
and baby get encouragement and rein· 
forcement if they've begun to thrive," · 
Laivetes said. "And if they haven't, we 
do need to keep an eye on them." The 
babies and their mothers are put under 
the close supervision of a local pediatri-
cian, and asked to return to the 
hospital for periodic check-ups. 


The active follow-up of the 
Woolston team is just another example 
of the thoroughness of their approach. 
Woolston sees it as "a prototype of how 
research in child psychiatry will need 
to be" in the future. "I think this will be 
a model of how all the different levels, 
ranging from the molecular to the 
psychosocial, interact in this stage of 
human development."
