EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When our plane landed at Tampa Airport, Andrew Hoskins wanted to make 
sure the crew's arrival did not go unnoticed. Dressed as an Arabian sheik, 
Andrew led us off the plane, kneeled 
down and kissed the ground. 

Although not everyone makes it as 
obvious as Andrew, all of us on the 
lightweight crew realize that the spring 
training trip to Florida means more 
than getting in shape. It is the pivotal 
point in our training, and a time of the 
most absurd contrasts: constant inter-
squad competition and unparalleled 
camaraderie, the most painful part of 
the training and yet the most eagerly 
awaited, a time when you want to cry, 
but all the same you somehow manage 
a smile as you limp down to the dock. 
Florida is the time when we become 
a team. 

While most of the squads are staying 
in the Holiday Inn, only about half the 
lightweights are there. The rest of us, 
including the freshman squad, are 
staying in the University of Tampa 
visiting team dorm, a cross between a 
dilapidated army barracks and a county 
jail. About thirty of us live in one 
large room with a vast array of small 
insects and no air conditioning. 

For all its disadvantages, the dorm 
encourages team unity. Teamwork is 
the difference between success and failure 
in crew. In a shell, everything must 
happen with perfect coordination so 
that the oars enter and leave the water 
together. The boat moves fastest not 
when you are pulling on the oar, but 
when the boat glides along after the 
stroke. A blade left in the water for 
even a fraction of a second too long 
drags down the whole shell. This is one 
reason why a crew is not remembered 
for individual members. At the end of 
this season, we will be remembered, 
fondly or otherwise, as the crew of 
1982.

The first practice reminded us of just 
how important teamwork is. As the 
sun rose, the eight-man shells pushed 
off from the dock and began the row up 
the Hillsborough River. 

The practice was frustrating. From 
his coaching launch, Dave (Vogel, 
lightweight crew coach) yelled at us, as 
each oar entered the water at a different 
time, and the shells rocked from 
side to side. As long as the shells are 
unstable, it is very difficult to put full 
power on the strokes. 

After practice we straggled back to 
our rooms and slept until the afternoon 
practice at 3:30. We have begun the 
pattern of dawn practice, sleep, after-
noon practice, sleep. Today we all 
slept between ten and twelve hours. 

Already it seems as if Dave has 
deliberately created a taskmaster image 
for himself. A rumor has started that 
Dave maintains such a severe attitude 
so that the team will be angry at him 
rather than at each other during the 
stress of Florida. Whether the rumor is 
true or not, he is clearly under pressure, 
not a physical one, but the emotional 
one of treading the poorly defined 
boundaries between friendship and 
favoritism, objectivity and coldness. 

March 9 

Today, Dave began the first in a series 
of individual competitions, otherwise 
known as seat racing. We row in four-
man shells, racing each other for three-
minute intervals or "pieces." After 
each piece, Dave yells "pull 'em together," 
the coxswains bring the boats 
side by side and two of us switch places. 
The person whose boat wins the next 
piece after the switch wins his seat 
race, and proves that he can move a 
boat faster than his teammate. 

Seat racing is the ultimate cruelty. 
All winter long we have cheered each 
other through practice, but now we 
rise and switch places in silence, having 
no one to turn to for encouragement. 

But cruel or not, Dave yelled the 
command and the shells began to race. 
My boat, stroked by Ivor Benjamin, 
won the first piece. For the second, 
Dave switched Ivor with the stroke of 
the other shell, Andy Tomback. Andy 
won the next piece, but not by as much 
as Ivor had won the first one. And so 
the morning went on, Dave making 
switches and recording the results. 

After practice, we all went to breakfast 
together and discussed what we 
thought the boats for the afternoon 
would be. The speculation never ends; 
it dominates our conversation and 
pushes tempers to the limit. We spend 


the first part of the morning staring at 
each other across the water, and the second 
staring at each other across a 
table. Sometimes things seem very 
claustrophobic. 

March 11: 

Despite all the seat racing we have 
been doing, none of us really knows 
what the results mean. The only indication 
Dave gives us is in the lineup 
boards, which indicate the boatings for 
the next workout. The names are lined 
up in vertical rows, paralleling the 
seats in a shell. Moving toward a seat 
in the stern is a good sign, moving 
toward the bow indicates trouble. 

We are beginning to really feel the 
effects of the hard 
practices. 
Everyone's hands graphically reflect 
the work. Our calluses from winter 
training have torn away, and hands 
swell, crack and bleed. Legs weaken so 
that standing becomes painful. The 
workouts even make lying down an 
ordeal; sore muscles can't be kept in 
the same position without pain. In the 
end, only complete exhaustion saves 
you from 
the torment of aching 
muscles, anesthetizing you in a deep 
sleep which never lasts long enough. 

March 13: 

By now practices are not only physically 
exhausting but mentally exhausting 
as well. No one could testify to this better 
than the seniors on the team who 
are trying, with little success, to work 
on their senior essays. 

We'll have a free day tomorrow, our 
only real day of spring break. To 
celebrate, tonight we went out to dinner 
at an Italian restaurant. The 
restaurant made the mistake of having 
an "all you can eat" salad bar, and 
inexpensive beer served in liter steins. As 
the owner now knows, the term "light-
weights" has no apparent relationship 
to how much we eat or to the style in 
which we celebrate. A record consumption 
of beer, five steins, led one 
enthusiast to knock out a window from 
the team van. Unfortunately, this took 
place while Dave was driving us home 
from dinner. 

March 15: 

Dave held a meeting before morning 
practice. Word had gotten out that he 
planned to punish the team for our 
conduct at the restaurant with an 
especially 
tough 
workout. 
Dave 
promptly denied that he ever punishes 
with practices; workouts are only to improve. 
But, as usual, the rumor was at 
least partially true: the workout was a 
killer. 

Workouts have been steadily getting 
harder. Everyone's hands look like 
ground-up hamburger. Before every 
practice most of us tape our hands to 
cover the blisters. But by now the tape 
only digs into and aggravates the torn 
skin. 

March 16: 

The dorm is slowly becoming unbearable. 
Last night someone moved his 
mattress into the locker room across 
the alley. It was air conditioned, and it 
certainly didn't smell any worse than 
the dorm. 

March 17: 

To ease some of the tension, the team 
members in the senior class, led by 
Captain Steve Gavin, organized one of 
the traditional spring training events, 
skit night. After a team barbecue by 
the Holiday Inn pool, each class performed 
a skit filled with bawdy humor 
making fun of the other classes, the 
coach, and rowing itself. The juniors' 
skit took full advantage of the phallic 
shape of a crew shell, and left the team 
in hysterics. 

The skits are a team catharsis, a 
primal scream in the midst of the 
fighting for the seats. In some sports 
getting angry gives you a competitive 
edge, but crew requires a discipline 
which allows for no wild moves or 
grudges. 

But as much as it vents frustrations, 
skit night also answers the question 
whyâ€”a question even the most dedicated 
oarsman asks himself between 
the fifth and sixth three-minute piece 
after he has just lost a seat race. Crew 
has a tradition for everything, and the 
answer to this question is no exception. 
At the end of the evening, after all the 
skits were finished, the seniors stood 
before the team and sang "Bright College 
Years." 

When you see the guys who have 
always been around sing about the 
"friendships formed at Yale," something 
hits home which puts the pain 
and the pressure of seat racing into 
perspective. 

Winning seat 
races 
doesn't mean much if your boat loses 
in the spring, and teamwork means 
more than winning races. 

For a moment everyone was quiet, 
but Florida allows little time for sentimental 
thoughts. The mood broken, 
everyone walked away laughing and 
joking. As we went to check the lineup 
board, there was another pause in the 
laughter. Even though you don't want 
to, you stare at the lineups horizontally 
rather than 
vertically, 
wondering
