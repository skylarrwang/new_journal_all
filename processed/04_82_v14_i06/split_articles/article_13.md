Berlin-dozens each day. It was a hap-
py time because I really believed that 
everything the Soviets did was on the 
long run good for a new Democratic 
Germany. 
TNJ: Did you feel any pressure from 
Stalin or Ulbricht? 
WL: At that time, due to our know-
ledge that Berlin would be an inter-
allied city run by the Soviets, Ameri-
cans, British, French, our directives 
were not yet so _harsh as later. 
The task was to set up both the city 
government of Berlin and the district 
in such a way that the Western Allies, 
which would most likely come in June, 
1945, would have nothing to complain 
about, and would immediately legalize 
the authorities we set up. 
TNJ: Those were the orders you 
received? 
WL: Yes. There was once a strange 
situation when Ulbricht once said all 
our district authorities must look 
democratic, but we have to have all 
important positions in our hands. 
Communists usually had the second 
man of a city or of a district which was 
responsible for personnel and the chief-
of-police. So, numerically the Com-
munists were in a minority, but they 
had the most important positions in 
their hands. 
TNJ: Did you ever meet Joseph 
Stalin? 
WL: I never met Stalin, but I saw him 
from afar at the demonstrations on the 
first of May and on the 7th of Novem-
ber (anniversary of the October 1917 
revolution) in which we all participated.

Of high-ranking Soviet leaders, I 
had only the opportunity of meeting 
two. One, in summer 1945 when I was 
the private secretary of Ulbricht, I met 
twice for longer conversations Marshal 
Zhukov (a Wartime hero). And the 
second leader I met was in September, 
1947. At the second congress of the 
Socialist Unity Party in East Berlin the 
official representative of the Soviet 
Communist Party was Mikhail Suslov, 
who already at that time played a great 
role. 
TNJ: What was your impression of 
Suslov? 
WL: I had the same impressions of 
most other people. He was a person of 
ice-cold, absolute clarity in his diction 
and his speech very ideological, very 
cold. He almost never smiled or laugh-
ed. He was a top ideologist at that 
time. 
TNJ: Are all Soviet leaders like that? 
WL: He is a typical chief ideologist of 
the Soviet Communist system. both 
under Stalm and after Stalin, and in 
meetin!l him you feel his role. 
TNJ: Your escape from Stalinism was 
made in 1949 to Yugoslavia. Was the 
position takl·.1 by Yugoslavia against 
Stalin of such importance to you that it 
merited a life-threatening escape? 
WL: Yes, the stand taken by the 
Yugoslav 
Communist:. under the 
leadership of Tito in 1948 a~ainst 
Stalin was exact!}: the decisive event 
that changed my life. 

Already a few weeks after the Yugo-
slav break with I\.1oscow, I received 
Yugoslav materials which were clan-
destinely spread in East Germany like 
in all countries of the Soviet bloc which 
I read like an eye opener, and of 
course, had to hide because not even 
we as party officials were allowed to 
have any page written and published 
by Yugoslav Communists. 
From summer 1948 to March 1949 I 
really had to live a doubie life officially 
being still a lecturer at the High Party 
School "Karl Marx" and in reality h<:-
ing an active oppositional of the Titoist 
line. When my sympathies for the 
Yugoslav Communists through an in-
discretion became known , I had to 
escape on March 12, 1949 and it was 
as you mentioned an escape of life-
danger, until 13 days later I reached 
Belgrade. I thought at that time that I 
had made the right step and have never 
regretted my escape from East Ger-
many to Yugoslavia ever since. 
TNJ: Many persons have wondered 
why didn't you go straight into the 
Western zones of Germany? I mean 
what was there in Yugoslavia which 
was so important that it merited your 
escape to Yugoslavia instead of going 
to the West? 
WL: This is of course the major theme 
of my autobiographical story, "Child 
ofthe Revolution." In 1948-49 I still 
considered myself to be a critical Com-
munist implying I believed in the 
teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. 
I was also very critical about the imple· 
mentation of these teachings by Stalin 
in the Soviet Union and Ulbricht in 
East Germany, and I was longing for a 
country where I hoped the ideas of 
Marx, Engels, Lenin on the socialist 
society would be correctly imple-
mented without the horrors of Stalin-
ism and the Ulbricht system in East 
Germany. Therefore, Yugoslavia for 
me was a revolutionary country, a 
:.ocialist country led b)' a Communi'lt 
Party separating itself from Stalin and

Most of my schoolmates had 
an arrested mother or an ar-
rested father or both. 
openly attacking Stalinism was exactly 
the fulfillment of the ideals I had at 
that time. 
TNJ: Your first years in the West must 
have been if not difficult, a rather 
novel experience. 
WL: Yes, it was a very novel exper-
ience and 1'11 never forget the Novem-
ber day of 1950 when I arrived in West 
Germany seeing for the first time 
modern traffic, well-stocked houses, 
and completely complacent primarily 
non-political people. Every day in the 
Western world was for me almost an 
incredible adventure because many 
things taken for granted by people 
growing up in the West were for me 
completely an incredible novelty. For 
instance, a few days after arriving in 
the West I was going with a good 
friend in the car when suddenly in the 
city was general traffic control. The car 
where I was, was stopped by a police-
man. I was shivering and pale expect-
ing of course that the policeman would 
now immediately ask me for all the 
documents I have and interrogate me 
about all my political activities in my 
life and about my political views. I still 
remember the incredible shock when I 
found out that this policeman was only 
asking stupid questions about if the 
lights were in order, if the tires were ok 
and asked to check the wipers. I was 
waiting for the real thing-the political 
questions. But they never came. The 
policeman went away and just left the 
car driving onwards. I had never seen 
a policeman not interested in political 
questions but only in simple idiotic 
traffic and motorcar problems. Similar 
adventures now came almost every 
week and they led to a gradual change 
about some of my preconceived views 
on Western democracies. 
TNJ: As someone who teaches at Yale, 
do you think it's possible for people 
who are sheltered from history to still 
be politically aware? 
WL: It is possible, bUl it takes, of

course, intellectual work to put your-
self in a system which is very different 
from your own. It is a difficult thing 
because most people are always judg-
ing everything from their own exper-
ience. For me, one of the most impor-
tant characteristics of intellectual 
thinking is the capability of thinking 
yourself into a completely different cul-
ture, a completely different economic 
and political system and with intellec-
tual activity trying to understand it. I 
think the majority of Yale students are 
capable of doing so. 
For me, for instance in the 60s, I 
had the opportunity of being six times 
in Africa and six times in Asia, and 
many things I didn't understand be-
fore I began to rethink. 
TNJ: Where do you stand politically 
today in the European context? 
WL: I am not a member of any politi-
cal party in Europe. Despite my per-
sonal involvement in the Communist 
movement in my youth and many ex-
periences including tragic experiences 
in my own life and the life of my family 
under Stalin, I am trying very serious-
ly in all my work and analysis never to 
act emotionally and always extremely 
rationally. I hope it's not necessary 
therefore to state that I am neither a 
Communist any more nor am I a hard 
line anti-Communist. In fact, I am 
equally far away from both of these ex-
tremes. 
TNJ: Have you ever wanted to settle 
down and teach on a full-time basis 
either at Yale or in Germany? 
WL: No. I am perfectly happy with 
the arrangement made with Yale as a 
Professor (Adjunct). I am a European 
who very much likes to be in the 
United States and spend half of the 
year in an American academic en-
vironment but I have never tried to 
become an American or to pretend to 
be an American. 
TNJ: Some students fear you present a

negative view of the Soviet Union 
which most students accept unques-
tionably. What do you think about 
this? 
WL: I don't think that the views that I 
give in the lecture course are too nega-
tive. After having lived fourteen years 
in Communist-ruled countries (and ten 
of those fourteen years in the Soviet 
Union under Stalin) it was and is my 
aim both in my writings as well as in 
my lecture courses to be as objective as 
it is humanly possible. If there is one 
aim in my life in the University, it is 
not to repeat my own experiences but 
give the possibility of pluralism of a 
choice of interpretations. 
TNJ: For many of the students in your 
class this may be the only time they will 
ever study the Soviet Union. How will 
you hope to influence their percep-
tions? 
WL: I hope to overcome any kind of 
one-sidedness-primitive anti-Com-
munism as well as any illusions about 
the nature of the dictatorial system in 
the Soviet Union. My hope would be 
that students after taking the lecture 
course will have a deeper understand-
ing of different periods in Soviet 
history, and understand the differences 
between the rulers and the ruled, the 
leaders and the population, the Rus-
sians and the non-Russian nationali-
ties, the ruling strata which live a priv-
ileged life and the workers. To sum up, 
they will have a more differentiated 
view of Soviet society. And most of all, 
never confuse the regime with the 
population.
