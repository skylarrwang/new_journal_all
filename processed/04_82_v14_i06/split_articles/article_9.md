**Title: The noise behind the Walkman**
**Author: W. Hampton Sides**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

. . . as the appreciation of modern physics 
requires more and more prior education, so 
the appreciation of modern art and music re-
quires a more educated-some would say a 
more thoroughly conditioned-aesthetic taste 
. . . Unless the artist and the recipient have 
had the same experience the communication is 
always less than faithful.

The walkmen are all over campus 
today. I saw them walking around at 
the gym and in the library, across from 
Yale Station and down on York Street. 
They were walking briskly through the 
Art Gallery, toward the Law School, 
out of Commons, and onto the Green. 
I would like to know, who are these 
walkmen? Where are they headed? 
And why do they walk all the time? Do 
they like to walk, or is it something 
they are required to do? 

Of course I wouldn't bother asking a 
walkman these questions, because I 
know that a walkman generally doesn't 
like to talk to people. It's not that he is 
a shy or scary person; he just isn't big 
on conversation, that's all. He'd really 
rather keep his ideas to himself, and 
he'd appreciate it if others would kindly 
do the same. Besides, he's got a lot of 
ground to cover today, a lot of walking 
to do to meet the prescriptions of his 
well-worn appointment book. No time 
to talk. He likes his privacy, you know, 
and he absolutely abhors the sound of 
the human voice, particularly his own. 

In fact, he can't abide live noises at all, 
like the sound of turning pages, or a 
sneeze, or a cough, or a panhandler's 
pitch down by the Co-op. 

I've never met anyone so self-
assured as a walkman. He knows what 
he wants to hear and see and do with 
such an unshakable confidence that he 
must forbid the extraneous world from 
interfering with his well-laid plans. 
Life must be so smug and restful in 
that nomadic altered state of his. And, 
if a walkman ever talked, I wonder if 
anyone could understand him. Unless 
one listens to the same tapes, it must be 
a powerful drain on the system to try to 
make sense out of someone who has 
been walking around so long listening 
to a program so different from anyone 
else's. 

The walkman is no conformist, but 
an individualist, at heart. Each one has 
his own specialty, his own discipline, 
his own language- and his own des-
tination. 

The other day I saw a Yale student 
reading his physics textbook in a 
basement-level weenie booth in the 
Cross Campus Library. His walkman 
turned on, his body buried within its 
fluorescent closet two floors 
underground, he punched his pocket 
calculator and nodded quietly as his 
taped program rushed through his 
headphones. 

I stood for a while staring at him 
through the narrow slat of glass in the 
sliding door. It struck me how strange 
it all was- the price a person will pay 
for seclusion, the lengths he will go to 
avoid having to talk with someone else, 
the determination that will drive him 
to tune out his environment and turn 
on his private learning machine. This 
person, presumably, paid Yale 
thousands of dollars for a dose of the 
"liberal arts," and here he was locked 
away every night in a formica box tak-
ing in the subtleties of quantum theory 
-alone in his own, aural insular 
world. 

I wanted to ask him what he was 
listening to on the tape recorder, but I 
suppose that would be an invasion of 
the man's privacy, so of course I didn't. 
By now I have learned of the sacred 
and inviolate nature of a fellow's 
privacy, and I would never dream of 
disturbing anything of such impor-
tance and worth. Besides, I had my 
own studying to do. 

The emergence of the Sony walk-
man in the library and elsewhere sug-
gests that, more and more, education 
is becoming a private affair. No longer 
do people come to the university to 
hear and argue other people's ideas, to 
theorize and speculate with the person 
who speaks from the stump or writes in 
the paper. Instead, they close their ears 
from the commotion and retreat into 
their special compartments. 

The world is too complex for them. 
There are too many errant strands of 
too many different ideas parading 
noisily around, too many tangents 
which disrupt and confuse. Modern 
thought is too busy, too abstract, too 
monumental. The weight of this com-
plexity threatens them and drives them 
to train to be the expert, the specialist, 
the professional. All the incomprehen-
sible noise makes them insecure; they 
feel they must be masters of some-
thing. 

Their discomfort prods them to 
learn with good faith and sound pa-
tience all the ideas, the theories, and 
the parlance of a program; they prac-
tice the symbols and study them and 
discuss them with the few others who 
have chosen the same program. No 
one else understands these symbols, 
nor can they understand the symbols of 
the others in the next booth. 

It is happening all around us. Today 
the economist with his new theories, 
and the computer science technician 
with his newly-developed language, 
and the psychology major with his new 
approach, and the musicologist with his 
12-tone composition, all speak in dif-
ferent tongues and operate within dif-
ferent worlds. As each one rises along 
the scale of subtlety and expertise, he 
must find it increasingly difficult to 
communicate the ideas of his chosen 
field to those not in it, particularly as 
more and more advances are made in 
each discipline. And, conversely, he 
must find it equally difficult to ap-
preciate the ideas of the other spe-
cialists. Such is the sacrifice for exper-
tise in a world that so demands and 
values experts. 

I visualize a time in the future when 
all walkmen at Yale and other univer-
sities will climb into their booths each 
day and tune into their separate pro-
grams, each one in a 
specialized 
language, training themselves for their 
specialized place among the specialists 
who will run the country. The best and 
the brightest will flock to these schools 
to learn their trade, here where the 
banner of technological progress and 
civilization flies so proudly. For those 
unacquainted with the vast body of 
terms and theories that form the foun-
dation of each discipline on each pro-
gram, the walkman tape will play only 
noise: nonsensical, atonal, inaccessible 
noise. But for the trained ear, the same 
tape will play powerful and prestigious 
noise, guaranteed to make a profit. 

And for the sake of Progress, the 
thinkers and scientists and technocrats 
will walk around not listening to each 
other.
