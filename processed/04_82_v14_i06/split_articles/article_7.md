Freshman year. The first week. 
"There's an organization meeting for AASA this afternoon," my floating counselor urged, "You should go." 
So I did. About 60 Asians crowded into Trumbull's common room. We sat in a circle, fighting intrusive elbows and oppressive heat, and began introductions. I was first: "My name is Anita, and I'm from Syracuse, and I'm in JE." The next person was more talkative, adding that she hoped AASA would strengthen her Asian identity.

AASA's newsletter, East-West Currents, is sent out as a regular source of information on the efforts of the organization but many Asian-Americans I know do not even read the publication.

It would seem that some in AASA have succumbed to this tendency. In his editorial in East-West Currents, Brian
