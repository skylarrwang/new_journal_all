During these last d ays of Florida, 
everyone is beginning to want to come 
back to the Housatonic River in Derby 
and test ourselves against the other 
crews in the East. As Dave constantly 
reminds us, we will have to get a great 
deal faster if we want to win the 
Eastern Sprints in May. 
· Even after all the seat racing, we still 
don't know what boats we are in. 
When we return to Derby, the scar rac-
ing and practices will continue. Six 
races in eight weeks are ahead. As hard 
as it is, Florida is really only the begin-
ning of the workload, not the end. 
But the team has already passed a 
test of sorts. The boats move with a 
certain assurance, a steadiness and 
power which foretell of great things. 
After two weeks in Florida, we have 
started to understand why seat racing 
is so valuable even if the results aren't 
always clear: somehow all the competi-
tion has taught us to trust each other 
for more than a three-minute piece.
