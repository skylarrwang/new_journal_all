EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Kanno accuses Asians outside of 
AASA of "ignoring the fact that they 
are Asians." He writes, "I 
think 
everyone should feel that they are . 
Asian-American and be proud of it." 
Participation in AASA has become an 
index of one's cultural awareness; those 
who are not active members risk ac-
cusations of having subordinated their 
Asian heritage to the pressures of a 
white world. The term "Banana" is 
bandied about: non-active members of 
AASA are only "yellow" on the outside; 
inside, they are "white." 

But a decision not to participate in 
AASA should not imply indifference or 
ignorance or shame. It isn't fair for 
Kanno to use such a decision as a 
meter of ethnicity; more important, it 
isn't accurate. Kanno declares he is 
"fed up with Asian-Americans check-
ing the box 'Asian' on their Yale ap-
plication and thereafter ignoring the 
fact that they are Asians." How can he 
know that they are ignoring this fact? 
What makes him so certain? I would 
suggest that he can~ be certain; simply 
looking at the rolls of active members 
of AASA is not a valid way to locate 
those who have a strong Asian identi-
ty. Many of us who choose not to par-
ticipate in AASA have an equally 
strong awareness of our heritage; we 
speak the languages of our parents and 
grandparents, we eat their food, we 
know their history. 

Many of Yale's Asian-Americans 
have become alienated from AASA. 
Consider the reaction of one of my 
Chinese friends when she received the 
latest AASA newsletter: "I hardly ever 
read that thing. They make such ab-
surd statements that I can't take them 
seriously." Other friends have voiced 
similar sentiments; they don't believe 
in AASA , its membership, its lan-
guage. And isn't this the supreme 
irony? An organization like AASA is, 
in its own words, supposed to promote 
cultural unity. Instead, it acts as a 
divisive, destructive 
force 
among 
Asians at Yale; lines have been drawn 
between active and non-active mem-
bers of AASA. 

Judgments by superficial consider-
ations, such as active membership in 
AASA, is a dangerous thing: it is 
precisely this reliance on externals 
which leads to fear and hatred and 
racism. Anyone who would make a 
determination by using such a flimsy 
standard is jumping to conclusions. 
And as Norton Juster once pointed out 
in The Phantom Tollbooth, escaping from 
the Island of Conclusions is a long and 
difficult endeavor. It would be best to 
resist the impulse to jump in the first 
place.
