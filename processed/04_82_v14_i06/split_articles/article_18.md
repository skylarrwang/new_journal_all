**David Frum: The Conservative Voice at Yale**
**Author: Gabriella Stern**
**Page number(s): 30**

Everyone hates David Frum, or so it seems, judging from the screaming headlines on the op-ed page of the Yale Daily News: 
"Frum: Distortions, Misrepresentations and Lies;" "Frum 'laden with lies';" "Frum's Awful Spectre." His name has become a term of disparagement among liberals on campus, synonymous with elitist conservatism. "Now you're talking like David Frum," more than one student has been overheard saying to another in Frum's attire approximates preppie. 

During our interview he wore a brown-and-grey, tweed sports jacket over a pink sweater, beige slacks and penny loafers. Thick, neatly-clipped, curly dark-brown hair frames broad, fleshly cheeks and an immense forehead. A pair of tortoise-shell granny glasses sit on a long, wide nose that slopes into a pair of flared nostrils. As he talks, his shapeless lips are shifted somewhat to one side, and he holds his hands close in front of his face, wriggling his fingers, and flexing one hand or the other with a quick wrist movement. 

Frum loves to talk, and he talks about his notoriety on campus in the enthusiastic manner of a gourmet discussing food. He uses many compounds, nouns and adjectives, and tends to be much less concise in person than in his column. 

"Writing columns has been enormously educational for me. At first, my ideas were such a hodge-podge, a contradictory and complicated mess of notions. I had to learn to be consistent within a column and between columns." So far, he's been quite consistent. Since January 1981, when he began the column, he has come out against nuclear disarmament, the Equal Rights Amendment, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the annual Yale Hunger Action Program fast, a Peace Conference held here in February and last fall's "Take Back the Night" march organized by local feminist groups. 

"My column is a kind of public service. I'm preventing the Daily from becoming a Maoist rag. I'm preserving some balance. You have to force the course of a political discussion. 
"I like causing fuss,~ says Frum, whose weekly column , "Juvenilia," (which means "youthful works" in Latin) has provoked dozens of letters and opinion pieces from students and professors, particularly feminists and pacifists, upset by his radically right-wing views. Nevertheless, Frum claims to speak for a large number of closet conservative undergraduates at Yale, "the 20 per cent who voted for Reagan," he says, his thick, pink lips spreading into a wide, gap-toothed smile. "I think you'd be astonished at the number of people who do not share the liberal concerns at Yale. Eighty per cent of all college graduates are Republicans. Most Yale students will be conservatives after college." 

After college, Frum, T.D., '82, might have a job writing speeches for Vice-President George Bush, although no final arrangements have been confirmed. If it falls through, he'll work for the Conservative Party of Canada as a researcher or policy assistant, after which he'll either go into punditry or business. If he chooses business, he plans to "make some money and buy first editions."
