Long Memory: The Black Experience in 
America 
by Mary Frances Berry & John W. 
~lassingame 
1982 Oxford University Press 486 pp. 
John Blassingame, Chairman of Afro 
American Studies Program and Pro-
fessor of Southern History, never 
believed that the traditional historical 
narrative, with its dry rendition of 
facts had much relation to reality. In-
stead, he feels that the best way to con-
vey the meaning of Afro American 
History is to exa ... ; •• e the dominant ex-
periences from slavery up to the pres-
ent. In Long M emory, the new survey of 
black history, he and Mary Frances 
Berry, Professor of History and Law at 
Howard University, 
have selected 
"those themes and 
subjects 
most 
revealing of the complexities of the 
black experience" for 'an integrated 
presentation across time instead of a 
comprehensive chronology of black 
history. This approach has led the 
authors to include topics usually absent 
from historical texts, and to draw con-
clusions which have a different em-
phasis 
from 
those of traditional 
scholarship. 


Memory and the transmission of ex-
perience from generation to generation 
have played a powerful role in the sur-
vival of blacks in America, the authors 
say. They contend that every genera-
tion has built upon the lessons the 
preceding ones learned about Africa, 
oppression, protest, sexual exploita-
tion, education, racial solidarity, the 
family and the church. Long M emory is 
composed of richly detailed essays that 
elaborate these fundamental themes. 


The authors consider Africa and the 
slave experience "central 
to an 
understanding of the American past." 
They compare West African 
an d 
American slavery and show that the 
adjustments Africans made to slavery 
in the New World stem from their 
West African cultural origins. Blass-
ingame and Berry view the Americas 
as "an outpost of West African culture 
between the 
sixteenth and 
mid-
nineteenth century." What has shaped 
Afro Americans into a distinctive peo-
ple is their African memory, whose im-
print upon speech, dress, literature, 
medicine, cooking, music and religion 
has prevented American culture from 
becoming a pallid imitation of Europe. 


Afro American history is seen as a mir-
ror of the history of the other citizens of 
the United States, reflecting the social, 
economic and political structure in 
which they have been enmeshed. 


Long Memory shows how certain 
features of plantation slavery were 
shaped by the Africans' reactions. For 
example, 
~lassingame interprets the 
extensive evidence of the slaves' brutal 
punishments as the conseq uence of 
their persistent forms of resistance. 
Such harsh coercion, he points out, 
would have been unnecessary for the 
loyal, docile work force of grinning 
Sambos conventional history has por-
trayed. There is a qualitative dif-
ference, Blassingame emphasizes, be-
tween choosing survival over suicide 
and having a docile attitude- a dif-
ference 
traditional scholarship has 
neglected to discern. 


Blassingame and Berry do not ac-
cept the conventional view that slavery 
has caused extreme disintegration in 
black social life. They find that an 
amazing degree of social cohesion and 
stability remained through the endu r-
ing interaction between the chu rch and 
the family. This lasted both during and 
after slavery, despite the formidable 
legal, cultural and economic obstacles. 
They examine the factors which con-
tributed to family disintegration and to 
family stability in different epochs and
