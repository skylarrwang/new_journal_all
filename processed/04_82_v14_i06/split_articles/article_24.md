Moth" and child int"act on video. 
A seven month-old girl was admitted 
recently to Yale-New Haven Hospital. 
She weighed eleven pounds. Though 
her mother reported that she was a 
"voracious eater," she appeared to be 
starving. To the frustration of parents 
and doctors, the full series of pediatric 
tests revealed no physical illness which 
might explain her failure to grow. 

Dr. Joe Woolston, the Yale child 
psychiatrist who examined the baby, 
had reason to suspect an nnotio1141 
source for the failed growth. When the 
baby responded to her first week in the 
calm environment of the hospital by 
gaining a 
few 
ounces, 
Woolston 
thought his suspicions were confirmed: 
time away from home, under the care 
of the nursing staff, had apparently 
helped the baby to gain a full half-
pound. 

Dr. Woolston and his team of 
researchers at the Yale Child Study 
Center are studying a puzzling syn-
drome of growth failure in infancy call-
ed "Nonorganic Failure to Thrive" 
(NFTT). The syndrome is the most 
frequent cause of infant weight delay 
in the United States. More common 
than malnutrition,it is found in one to 
five percent of all infants admitted to 
U.S. hospitals. NFTT children are six 
to 16 months old, have stopped gainins 
weight, and may have stopped growing 
in length and head size: they often ap-
pear scrawny and pale, may vomit ex-
cessively, show extreme lethargy, and 
many times display a wide-eyed stare 
researchers call "radar gaze." 

Early 
researchers believed 
that 
NFTT babies failed to grow as a result 
of parental neglect or emotional abuse. 
Later findings, however, suggest the 
babies may be inherently difficult. 
They may cry too much, or may be 
difficult to feed and cuddle, thus con-
tributing to the stressful relationship 
between mother and baby.
