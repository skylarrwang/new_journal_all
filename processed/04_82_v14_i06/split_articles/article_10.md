February brought a brief taste of 
celebrity status 
to 
Dr. 
Alan 
DeCherney, Director of Reproductive 
Endocrinology at Yale-New Haven 
Hospital. In the space of a week, an ar-
ticle he'd written on French research 
findings that fertility in women ap-
parentJy decreases sharply after age 
30-not, as previously thought, age 35 
-was published in The New England 
Journal of Medicine, discussed on the 
front page of The New York Times, 
and got him an interview with Jane 
Pauley on the Today show. 
"I wasn't nervous one bit," Dr. 
DeCherney said. 

Infertility has become a hot media 
topic in recent months, following the 
birth of the first American test tube 
baby in January. Public attention has 
been focused, in particular, on the two 
relatively new and controversial 
methods by which human conception 
can be medically accomplished: ar-
tificial insemination and in vitro ("test 
tube") fertilization. 

For artificial insemination, sperm 
provided by either the woman's hus-
band or an anonymous donor is simply 
inserted by the doctor. Artifical in-
semination has been done at Yale-New 
Haven for more than 10 years, most 
commonly for married couples where 
the husband does not make enough 
sperm to impregnate his wife, or is the 
carrier of a genetic disease. 

"Cystic fiorosis is a good example," 
Dr. DeCherney said. "It's a recessive 
trait, so both the mother and the father 
have to have it to produce a baby with 
the disease. A couple has a baby with 
cystic fibrosis: therefore you know they 
both have that trait. So there's a 25 per 
cent chance that their next child will 
also have cystic fibrosis. Now, they can 
take a chance-or they can use a donor 
who has no history of cystic fibrosis in 
his family , and be sure the baby won't 
have it." 

In vitro fertilization is performed 
when the woman's Fallopian tubes are 
blocked because of damage or disease, 
preventing normal movement of an 
egg from an ovary to her uterus. She is 
given a fertility drug to induce a multi-
ple ovulation, 
and 
the eggs are 
surgically removed and fertilized in the 
lab with sperm provided by her hus-
band. All embryos that develop are 
then 
surgically 
implanted 
in her 
uterus. 

This is news to the media, but it is 
part of Dr. DeCherney's daily routine. 
Leaning back in his chair behind his 
desk, a bow tie at his collar and cigar in 
hand, he explained: 

"We've recovered eggs, and fertil-
ized eggs, and put them in uteruses 
here- but no pregnancies yet. We 
started doing it over the summer, and 
then we stopped. Why did we stop? I 
wanted to evaluate what we were do-
ing, and also we'd lost our operating 
room. They're building a new hospital 
wing, so I was temporarily out of 
facilities. I've just got my old room 
back: they were doing Caesarian sec-
tions in it. 

"Artificial insemination by donor is 
difficult because it's a very confidential 
thing," he said earlier. "I have to get 
the donor myself, make the appoint-
ments myself- it's time-consuming. 
I'm meticulous about confidentiality. I 
always write the same note on every 
chart and tell every patient the same 
thing- it's my only protection. 

"See, I don't want my records sub-
poenaed, .. he said. "Because, let's say 
10 years from now the husband wants 
to get divorced. He doesn't want to pay 
child support. Now I'm pulled into 
court: 'Is he the father of this child?' 
And I would say, 'Well, I don't really 
know. All I know is that on the ninth of 
December we discussed donor insem-

ination.' You might say, 'That's 
ridiculous- you're really setting 
yourself up by keeping poor records.' 
But the alternative is to leave my 
records complete and jeopardize the 
donor's anonymity. Then the kid can 
say, 'Oh, now I want the donor to pay.' 
A lot of doctors have patients sign con-
sent forms, and then destroy the con-
sent forms when the women conceive. 
Well, that's silly. But if you signed a 
consent form, that's evidence of what 
happened-so I don't have donor in-
semination patients sign. 

"Now there is one fault in not re-
cording the names of the donors," he 
went on. "If the baby's born with a 
genetic disease, I could never go back 
and tell the donor that he's a carrier. 
But that's rare, and problems with loss 
of anonymity are not rare. So donors 
understand that, and they accept that." 

Dr. DeCherney selects donors to 
match the husband's physical char-
acteristics: height, build, eye and hair 
color. The men are screened for 
genetic disease by history. Those who 
are Jewish have a Tay-Sachs test, and 
those who are Black have a sickle-cell 
test. ("They're the two things we can 
test for with facility.") Donors are paid 
$25 per contribution, and come from 
the ranks of residents, house staff, and 
medical students at Yale-New Haven. 
This is because of convenience, Dr. 
DeCherney emphasized: "It's done ear-
ly in the morning, so women can go to 
work, and these people are here then. 
We don't have a frozen spenn bank-
it's expensive to maintain, and the 
pregnancy rates are not as high. 

"We do use the sperm bank in New 
York City for special purposes," he ex-
plained. "A man who is going to have a 
vasectomy, or a man who is going to be 
treated for cancer of the testicle will put 
his spenn in a bank first. Or, if some-
one came to me and said they wanted 
an Annenian" donor with blond hair 
"We're just putting an egg 
and a sperm together that 
hopefully would have gotten 
together anyway."

and green fingernails, I would call up 
and ask, 'Do you have somebody?" 

Although the use of donor eggs and 
sperm for 
in 
uitro 
fertiliza-
tion- theoretically possible- could 
raise similar issues to those of artificial 
insemination by donor, Dr. DeCher-
ney insisted it won't be done in the 
foreseeable future at Yale-New Haven 
Hospital. He also emphasized that 
Yale-New Haven does not discard em-
bryos in the lab. (Because considered 
tantamount to abortion, this has been 
a major reason for objections to the 
practice of in uitro fertilization.) Asked 
what he would do in the individual 
case of a defective embryo, Dr. 
DeCherney answered that it's never 
happened. 

*I don't know how I would handle 
that," he said. "I guess I would leave it 
up to the parents. I would say, 'This 
does not look like a perfect embryo-
we would prefer not to implant it- butÂ· 
we will do what you want."' 

Does he have any qualms about per-
forming in vitro fertilizations? 
"~o. not at all," Dr-
DeCherney 
said. "Because we do it as a service, we 
don't do it as a research tool. We're not 
doing any research in that field . So I'm 
not worried- it's just a service, it's 
something I can offer my patients that 
other doctors offer. 

"We're just putting an egg and a 
sperm together that hopefully would 
have gotten together anyway. This is 
the husband's sperm and the wife's egg, 
so ethically there is really very little 
concern over this exact procedure. 
What the ethicists are concerned about 
is that this is the first step into a long 
line of genetic engineering- maybe 
like they did in Braue New World-add-
ing testosterone to make overly ag-
gressive people, for instance. It's not 
feasible right now; but if people began 
to experiment with it, it would take ofT. 
Nobody's done it so far, because it's not 
ethical. But it's not an unreasonable 
concern." 

Clearly, one of Dr. DeCherney's 
main concerns is that services not be 
unreasonably withheld from patients. 

"I don't want to impose my ethical 
values on other people," he said. "All I 
do is give information, and let people 
make their own decisions.

Angela Holder advises doctors on the legal aspects of in vitro fertilization. 
"' did make a conscious decision to 
do d onor insemination 
in single 
women- that's not standard medical 
practice. And I do very, very few abor-
tions: only if it's my own patient, and 
she has a valid reason- which is usual-
ly medical. Now abortions are not a 
problem, because there are plenty of 
doctors who do them. But if I were to 
decide not to do donor insemination or 
not to do in vitro fertilization, I'd be 
closing the door to people. Being at 
Yale University, for some people we're 
the court of last resort." 

And, clearly, Dr. DeCherney feels 
these services are worthwhile. "If I was 
infertile, and the choices were donor 
insemination and adoption, I personal-
ly would pick donor insemination," he 
stated. "Even if there wasn't a long wait 
for an adopted child. To me, it's a bet-
ter solution than adoption because the 
woman goes through pregnancy. No-
body knows about it at home. My own 
feelings are that I wouldn't tell the 
child, or my neighbors, or my mother. 
And in my experience by the time the 
baby's born, most of the husbands have 
kind of forgotten it's a donor child. 
They go through the pregnancy; and 
it's not uncommon for these people to 
come back to my office with the baby, 
and everyone says, 'Oh, he looks just 
like his father.' It's happened so many 
times." 

II. 
To Angela Holder, 
Counsel for 
Medical-Legal Affairs at Yale Medical 
School and Yale-New Haven Hospital, 
artificial insemination and in vitro fer-
tilization are subjects on which her per-
sonal and professional opinions con-
flict. 

"I have serious personal questions 
about bringing a child into the world to 
be raised by one parent," she said in 
a South Carolina accent. "I mean, I'm 
divorced and I've got a kid- he was a 
toddler when his father and I were 
divorced- but I didn't intnad that he be 
brought up by a single parent. And it's 
really quite difficult- not just finan-
cially. It's a hard row to hoe. 

"That has nothing to do with what 
we do here," she continued. "My job 
here is whether or not something is 
legal. Now, when I am asked my legal 
opinion, I give it-but I don't hesitate 
to say also that personally I think it's a 
bad idea. I have talked to Alan 
DeChemey about doing a.i.d . for 
single women, and he disagrees with 
me. And I wouldn't say you slwuldn't do 
it. It's like my opinion on abortion. I've 
spent 25 years in one place after 
another giving out advice about abor-
tion rights, and I seriously doubt tJlat I 
would ever have one myself. But I'm 
beside myself when anyone tries to 
make decisions about someone else's 
body. I mean, my personal opinion is 
irrelevant." 

Legally, the problems posed by ar-
tificial insemination and in vitro fer-
tilization are by no means identical, 
Mrs. Holder emphasized. 

In vitro fertilization is a far more 
complex procedure medically; 
but 
because the two parents involved are 
married to each other, it presents 
essentially only one legal issue. If the 
manipulation of the embryo in the jar 
were to damage it in a way that
