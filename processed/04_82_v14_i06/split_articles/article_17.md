**CCL: The Friendliest (and Strangest) Library at Yale**

CCL Is the friendliest library at Yale. 

at the time of the confrontation, he sent a letter to Yale Daily News denouncing the skylight plans as technological and formalistic. He warned that "here the technological solution is innocent and unconcious enough, but pushed to its ultimate, for example, it was the on-ly process which could have unleased the Air Force upon Vietnam." Plans were made for Scully to fly back to Yale and deliver a lecture about the proposed library. Before his return, however, the firm dropped its plans for a skylight system, and the protest, its mission accomplished, dissolved. 

The library underwent a change in its proposed function while it was being designed. Originally, it was intended to be an Area Studies Library. At the request of librarians, plans for the interior were modified to make the stacks accessible and the library as a whole unintimidating. The building that resulted was carefully broken up into different kinds of study spaces. The front of the library contains comfortable, if unattractive, cushioned chairs. As you move to the back and downstairs, these give way to open tables, then to enclosed desks. The double study carrels at the sides of the library offer still greater privacy, and the single carrels at the back of the lower floor are insulated and completely self-contained. 

Many students were unimpressed, Upon completion in 1971 , the library was met with editorials moans. "You feel that somewhere along the line the architects must have failed to grasp the essential distinction between a warehouse and a library," wrote a former Yale Daily News chairman. Another opinion hailed CCL as "one of the deadest spaces on the campus, the great beige continuum." 

Today, however, most students who use CCL praise its design and coloring. "The reason I started studying here was because it was so dark and dull," Sophomore Val Pierce said. "The most colorful thing was the cover of your book." Graduate student Andy Cappel likes the beige because "it's so hideous it forces you to socialize or study or sleep." 

CCL is used so much, in fact, that it is deteriorating more rapidly than it is being repaired. The carpets are ripped and waterstained; in places they have been worn through to the floor. The paint is peeling, and the cushions of chairs are torn. "It needs a little more attention," Keith said. CCL's librarians, however, have had little success persuading Yale to pour more money into library maintenance. 


**CCL Closing Announcements: A Ballad of "Locomotive Breath" and Leaping Frogs**
**Page number(s): 29**

"Let's do the weenie again!" 
.At the stroke of midnight in an academic race 
Works the all-time weenie at a furious pace 
&u penal madly scribbling as he tries to gtt it down 
But nows the time for lulving and CCL is closing down 
You know, it must shut down. 
Its 11:45, we are closing soon. 
Its ch«kout deodline, we will grant no boon. 
Go to your dormitory, you can study on 'til dawn 
But now its time for leaving an.d CCL is closing, 
If you have closed reserve books, you know tluJJ you art there. 
Rttum those books an.d pamphlets, we have none to sptut. 
if not, we have to fine you. T1uu would not befon. 
But nows the time for leaving, CCL is closing. 
Everyone go home. 
-Matt Gold's venion of 
•Locomotive Breath•

The now-defunct tradition of singing CCL announcements began in the spring of 1977, when student worker Matt Gold ('79) grew bored of the standard closing message. "It seemed better to sing it," he recalled. "'d take a regular song and write new lyrics, weaving in 'it's 11 :45,' 'we dose at 12:00,' 'checkout is closed,' and 'return your closed reserve materials.' The problem was those four didn't rhyme very well." H is repenoire expanded to include such ballads as "She's Got a Paper to Write." Other workers joined in the fun, and some evenings featured a CCL sing-along. 

The library administration stopped the music, however, in the middle of the fall of '77, after Gold and fellow-workers broadcast a seven and a half-minute version of "Stairway to Heaven." "We got carried away," Gold said. "They told us ... it didn't fit in with their idea of how a library should run." 

CCL, however, has never been a normal library. Workers there still make occasional weird announcements. They fondly recall students' wilder Halloween costumes and Secret Society initiations. Several enjoy the story about the streakers this year (almost no one noticed them) or the Leap Year's Day when students released a garbage bag of frogs and everyone had to stop working to catch frogs. (The joke went bad the next day when people began to find dead frogs.) 

You can do almost anything you like in CCL, including drugs. A senior who considers the library a fine place to socialize recalled tripping there. "I remember going into CCL and looking up 'hallucinate.' Then I went running around and throwing books around, pushing them off shelves." He added, "It's not the average place to trip." 

It's not the average library, either, or the average social center. It's more than a gathering place and less than a melting pot. What is CCL? As Senior Fred Kaufman said, "CCL is relief in the face of books."
