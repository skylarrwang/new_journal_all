The political Union 
To the Editor: 
Jim Lowe is quite correct in claiming that the Political Union has an identity crisis, that it has an image of being elitist, and that the organization is on the decline. (TNJ, February 27, 1982) His reasons for drawing those conclusions are, however, incorrect. He claims that there have been weak programs, and that Yalies are politically apathetic and pre-professional. The problems of the Political Union run far deeper than any care to admit. 

Despite what the Political Union's Speaker Chris Bieda says, the program has not been feeble. During the fall term of 1981, 2 Cabinet officers, Betty Friedan, Edward Koch, Doug Fraser, Lyn Nofziger and Barry Commoner all spoke before the PU. The Union has continued its tradition of providing a strong speaker program. 

While political apathy has perhaps increased on campus, the PU boasted its largest memberships during the mid-1970s, after the Vietnam War and after Watergate. Apathy alone cannot explain the PU's decline. 

The concept of a "mass membership" PU is clearly not anachronistic (except, perhaps, for members of the Party of the Right.) We see, however, two problems which explain the Union's current situation. The first is the constant infighting among Political Union members seeking to attain office. The current election process inevitably leads to the proliferation of Machiavellian shenanigans. No sooner is one election over than the next one begins. Officers are interested in promoting the Union only insofar as it promotes their own political career. They use the Political Union for their own ends; political game playing is more important than political integrity. 

Political game-playing is the staple of the Party of the Right, and it is the POR which we see as a second obstacle to PU resurgence. Robert's Rules of Order, ideally, is to be used to facilitate the running of PU meetings. The POR, however, is determined to use Robert's to disrupt meetings. Bieda and Rubin are sadly misguided if they believe that such parliamentary perversions alienate "only a few people;" they alienate many. Besides, why should the PU continue to enforce rules that alienate anybody? 

One example of this parliamentary perversion is the "coat and tie" rule that the POR rammed through at a sparsely attended debate last year. That rule requires that members wear a coat and tie in order to speak at a Union meeting. The Union suspends the rule each term, though it remains on the books. A second perversion is the floor fight of last year, at which the POR attempted to manipulate the election rules to overwhelmingly favor its own members. Though the amendments were defeated, they are another example of how the POR uses the PU as its own personal tool. 

Finally, the image of the POR as a cadre of socially maladjusted children mars the Union's image as a whole. Each fall, hundreds of freshman are turned off by the POR's incestuous arrogance. The result is that the PU is considered to be the playground of the POR- in an important sense, it is. Through game playing and the appeasement of certain Union officers, the POR continues to have all too much influence on the affairs of the Union. 

Clearly, major reform is necessary in order to return the PU to its former glory. Equally clear, however is that the Party of the Right stands as an obstacle to any such reform.

The Long Wharf and the Yale Rep
Antonio Mercado's comparison of the Long Wharf Theatre and the Yale Repertory (TNJ, February 27, 1982) struck me as clever but inaccurate. Rather than indulge in town-gown stereotyping, one might more profitably distinguish between one theater and gadgetry. Such a distinction could lead to some discomfort and so- Mr. Mercado's disdain of comfort notwithstanding- the best policy may be to eschew comparison and simply to thank the Long Wharf for giving New Haven some excellent theater.

Anti-Semitism?
I was recently given a few issues of the New Journal, and was horrified to see the Walter Jacob cartoon used to illustrate Steve Epstein's fine article (â€¢How Law School Limits One's View, January 30th.) 

Let's recap. We have a personal statement about Yale Law School written by a law student named Epstein. And we have an accompanying cartoon picturing a man with a gigantic nose walking in a building which looks quite a bit like Yale Law School. Could the man with the huge nose possibly be Epstein? 

Well, it's hardly an original idea. There is a long history of ugly, bigoted cartoons of Jews with big noses, just as there is a long history of anti-Semitism at Yale. As someone who spent many years there-both as an undergraduate and an instructor- I am well acquainted with the often subtle and occasionally blatant anti-Jewish feeling at Yale. The cartoon is just one more reminder. 

Whether or not Mr. Jacob was conscious of what he was doing- whether or not he is Jewish himself-whether or not staff members of the New journal examined and approved the cartoon-it is an insulting and offensive image that should not have appeared.

Reply: we share your concern over the many subtle forms that anti-Semitism takes. In this case, however, we believe you are reading something into the cartoon which was not intended on any level by either the magazine or the artist. Walter Jacob says, "All my characters have big noses because I have a big nose. It makes no difference who I'm drawing. They all have big noses to me."
