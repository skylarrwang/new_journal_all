YALE settings. Long Memory credits the family and the church with providing a shelter from racism, segregation and exploitation, and laying down a foundation for communal strength, personal identity and individual triumph. The writers found evidence that many blacks led creative, rewarding lives filled with joys and hopes as well as pain and despair. They trace the growth of the independent black church, always a multipurpose and socially active body, and show how in the nineteenth century, it planted the seeds of the 1960s civil rights movement. The ministers, who became both political and religious leaders of their race, established the tradition that men such as Adam Clayton Powell and Martin Luther King fulfilled in our day.

Few surveys of black history devote as much attention as Long Memory to the participation of blacks in the military. An excellent essay, filled with rarely published detail, examines the paradoxical role of the black soldier from the Revolutionary War to Vietnam.

White racist discrimination emerges during every war, despite the blacks' bravery and willingness to die, and the widespread ambivalence blacks exhibited toward fighting America's battles. The crushing irony of the black soldier who fulfills his duty as a citizen on the battlefield only to be denied its fruits as a civilian is a recurrent theme. The authors go on to analyze the distinctive motives behind the black soldier's desire to fight. They also document rampant interracial conflict in American armies, and give special attention to the extraordinary proportions this reached during the Vietnam War.

Another dominant theme of black history Long Memory analyzes is the powerful nexus between the puritanical sexual mythology promoted by whites and the aggressively violent oppression of blacks. This link lies at the root of some of the most barbaric treatments of blacks in America, such as the savage mutilations white Southerners have committed on the burned bodies of lynched black men. Anecdotes, articles, police and court records illustrate the sexual taboo used to perpetuate the social and economic subjugation of blacks. Blassingame and Berry confront and expose the hypocritical reality cloaked behind white supremacist mythology: the flip-side of the vicious prohibition of sexual contact between black men and white women was the rampant sexual exploitation of black women by white men, and the active prevention of the examination of this reality. In 1887, for example, a Montgomery, Alabama newspaper editor commented on the increase of interracial sexual activity and wrote, "There is a secret to this thing, and we suspect it is in the growing appreciation of white Juliettes for colored Romeos." He was promptly run out of town. By exploring the bizarre consequences of rigidly imposed racial classifications and prohibitions against interracial marriage, Blassingame and Berry illuminate the evolution of many current black-white controversies.

Since the living contours of Afro American life are largely inaccessible by the conventional approach, Blassingame and Berry turned to a source neglected by most historians: the creative artist. Long Memory is filled with generous quotations from songs, poems, novels and plays which convey the existential quality of the era. The reproduction of numerous cartoons about black life adds a humorous touch to the lively narrative.

"The Economics of Hope and Despair" stands out as the most grim chapter in Long Memory. The precarious economic status of blacks is persistent--two years after Emancipation 43 per cent of black families were still living in poverty. The essay explains the development of the caste system that keeps blacks fluctuating between "depression and great depression." The authors conclude that "it seems highly unlikely that the majority of blacks could advance in the United States by continuing to play the economic game as long as whites are playing with loaded dice."

Black oppression has nurtured an ideal medium for the propagation of a deformed historiography entwined with myth and prejudice. The painstaking research and evaluation these authors have conducted over the past ten years has enabled them to interpret the past differently. For example, Blassingame and Berry find resisting oppression and asserting racial pride a natural attempt to maintain dignity instead of pathologically deviant behavior.

Reading Long Memory gave me the impression that the raucous insistence upon black self-definition raised during the upheavals of the 1960s prompted, to some extent, their reassessment of the evidence and their search for better evidence. For Long Memory gives to that insistence a refined, scholarly, and coherent expression. The thematic presentation enables the reader to understand cultural and social cohesion blacks have maintained despite tremendously hostile conditions. It is a lively, engaging, and enlightening book which effectively restores balance to the portrayal of the Afro American past. It provides a comprehensive look at some of the ignored frames left on the cutting room floor of America's history and offers valuable insights into the sources of black strength and survival in white America.
