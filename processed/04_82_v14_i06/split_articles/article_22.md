**Title: Venturi's firehouse: masterpiece or functional nightmare?**

If you go west out Broadway to where 
the streets branch off in three direc-
tions, take the middle of these, Gaffe 
Street, and walk on for a couple of 
blocks, you will come to a famous and 
perplexing building. There on your 
right will be the Dixwell Fire Station 
designed by the Philadelphia-based ar-
chitect, Robert Venturi. Designed in 
1970, the building has drawn praise 
from many architects and critics. 
Cesar Pelli, a prominent architect and 
Dean of Yale's School of Architecture, 
says that it's a 
"very successful 
building." Vincent Scully, Yale's 
highly 
respected 
architectural his-
torian, says, "I think it's marvelous!" 
But to the people who live around it 
and work in it, this acclaimed "master-
piece" is simply another building, or 
worse, a functional nightmare. Neigh-
bor Leslie Stanley says she "never real-
ly thought about it, other than it's neat 
and basically clean." The firemen think 
about it, but not in fond terms. They 
complain that the hard tile wall sur-
faces bounce sound so you can't hear 
anything over the P.A. system. The of-
ficers' quarters are at the opposite end 
of the building from the control room, 
adding unnecessary delay during an 
alarm. And the lights in the truck bay 
are the mercury vapor type which take 
fifteen minutes to turn on, leaving the 
fLre trucks long gone before they are 
lit. Fireman Bob Dawes sums it up by 
saying, "I'd rather work in an ugly 
building that's 
functional 
than 
a 
beautiful building you get lost in every 
time the alarm comes in." 

These reactions are all the more sur-
prising when you discover that the 
stated intentions of the architect were 
to design a totally functional building, 
rather than to shackle the users to some 
kind of"architectural ego trip." In fact, 
the building was part of a tremendous 
controversy at tbe time. 
Venturi 
sought to tear down everything about 
Modern Architecture which was ir-
reverent and insensitive to ordinary 
people. In his book Learning from Las 
Vtgas, he completc;ly shocked Modern 
architects by giving serious attention to 
the American ·strip. It was there, 
among the neon and biHboards and far 
from the centers of "high art,"· that 
Venturi felt the "desires and values of 
ordiilary people" found meaning. All 
that Modern architects would hold as 
"ugly and ordinary" summed up for 
Venturi the essence of"straightforward 
building in line with the needs of the 
client." Modern architects were in-
furiated. 

So the Dixwell Fire Station, which 
wholeheartedly embraces the spirit of 
this controversy, is supposed to be "ug-
ly and ordinary." It's supposed to fit 
perfectly into it's context, and it's sup-
posed to reflect "straightforwardly" the 
needs of the users within. New York 
Timts architecture cnuc Paul 
Goldberger said recently that the 
building is "practical, down to earth, 
and reason2ble." By Venturi's own ac-
count, "The building is simple in form 
-there are no wings or chances in roof 
height (like Modern architects would 
have done)-and big in scale. There 
are letters on the facade to identify it in 
the traditional manner of civic 
buildings, but when they reach the cor-
ner, the wall they are on disengages 
and cantilevers to make a brick 
signboard (like the billboards on the 
American strip)." But the building's 
rhetoric is not true to life. The building 
does not satisfy the firemen, and it 
doesn't fit so snugly into its context 
either. Although the neighbors report 
indifference to the building's presence, 
in apparent agreement with Venturi's 
rhetoric, there is something unsettling 
about the way it is set back from the 
street at a strange angle. It's nothing 
like the firehouse it replaced which has 
now been 
turned 
into 
Fitzwilly's 
Restaurant on 
Elm Street. That 
building sits politely in a neat row with 
all its neighbors, and is truly contex-
tual. 

By 
comparison, Venturi's 
building seems a lot more concerned 
with drawing attention to itself, sitting 
there at an angle with all that space 
around it. Even the color of its bricks 
seems a bit shocking compared with 
the more subdued colors of the sur-
rounding buildings. And what does a 
"brick signboard" have to do with the 
neighborhood consisting mostly of 
housing projects? Where's the strip? 
Just about everything the rhetoric 
claims seems wrong. 

So what's so great about the Dixwell 
Fire Station? Why should someone like 
Vincent Scully think it's "marvelous?" 
The answer, it seems, is hidden

somewhere outside the rhetoric which 
accompanied the design. Perhaps the 
rhetoric, as is often the case, conceals 
more than it illuminates. 

In an early and important publica-
tion, Complexity and Contradiction in Ar-
chitecture (1966), Venturi does not ad-
vocate dullness and ordinariness, but 
symbolism and formal complexity. Sym-
bolism, Venturi writes, means that ar-
chitects should adorn their buildings 
with symbolic cues which clarify their 
functional intentions. For example, 
Venturi would use a symbolic arch to 
indicate an entrance. This philosophy 
contradicted the established practice of 
Modern architects, whose complete 
devotion to abstract sculptural forms 
worked to disguise functional inten-
, tions. Ask anyone who has tried to find 
the entrance to the Art and Architec-
ture Building on York Street and you 
will sympathize with Venturi's outrage. 
Venturi's notion of formal complexity is 
also at odds with the premise of 
Modern Architecture. Modern ar-
chitects, Venturi says, start with a 
simplistic design concept and then try 
to shoehorn the diverse needs of the 
building into it. When Paul Rudolph 
designed the Art and Architecture 
Vmtun· 's firehouse 
building, he started with a sculptural 
idea and then fit the various studios 
and galleries into that concept. Ven-
turi, on the other hand, starts by con-
sidering the requirements of the 
building, allowing them to be visually 
expressed in a flexible end product. He 
says this invigorates the building and 
remedies the modern malaise of boring 
simplicity. The modern credo: "Less is 
more." About modern buildings like 
the Beinecke Rare Book Library, Ven-
turi would say, "Less is a bore!" 

Seen from this light, it becomes ap-
parent that when Venturi states the in-
tentions of the firehouse, he means that 
the building symbolizes those intentions. 
The layout of the building and the use 
of materials 
represent abstractly, 
rather than literally, the rhetoric sur-
rounding the design. The bricks, for 
example, are just metaphors for "or-
dinary building," because really or-
dinary buildings' bricks would have 
been different, as the Fitzwilly's exam-
ple shows. 

The reason for keeping it abstract 
and symbolic is that the building can 
straddle two worlds- the one offensive 
to Modern architects whose abstract 
language it speaks and who Venturi

bore!" 
wishes to attack, the other acceptable 
to ordinary people with whose com-
mon vernacular it associates. Says 
Charles Moore, an architect often 
compared to Venturi in importance, 
"If he can manage to infuriate the in-
tellectuals while he's not giving offense 
to the people around, he's doing exact-
ly what he means tc, what he probably 
ought to." 

But also, the abstraction establishes 
a uniqueness. The firehouse isn't quite 
like anything else, and that difference 
fends off the threat of anonymity, 
which is any artist's number one 
enemy. Venturi doesn't want his 
building to be confused with common 
architecture any more than he wants it 
to be confused with modern architec-
ture. After all, it isn't the worker hous-
ing next door to which Venturi truly 
aspires, but to great architecture of 
history. 

The real success of the DixweU Fire 
Station lies in Venturi's handling of 
formal 
complexity. 
He 
responds 
brilliantly to the functional and visual 
pressures acting on the site by the 
cityscape around it, and the fire com-
pany housed in it. The firehouse had to 
have a large room with big bay doors
