couldn't be detected during the preg-
nancy by amniocentesis (laboratory 
analysis of a sample of amniotic fluid 
from 
the uterus, extracted by a 
hypodermic needle, usually in the 16th 
week), then, when a child was born 
with a severe defect, the doctor might 
be liable. 

"Not to the parents, who presumably 
have signed consent forms," Mrs. 
Holder said. "But to the child-the 
child can sue, because nobody con-
sulted him. He might say that his 
parents had no authority to subject 
him to that kind of a risk. 

"But this is all very speculative," she 
added. "It's never happened. I mean, if 
I thought in vitro fertilization was a big 
risk, we wouldn't be doing it. When it 
was proposed, I had grave reservations 
on exactly this point- and I made it 
my business to talk to doctors both 
here and elsewhere that I thought knew 
something on the subject. They satis-
fied my concern. My concern is 
theoretical, and the medical judgments 
are that it won't occur." 

Artifical insemination is medically a 
much simpler procedure than in vitro 
fertilization. Legally, however, it is 
much more complex-when a sperm 
donor is used. 

"It's as safe as gening pregnant in the 
usual fashion," Mrs. Holder stated. 
"The only thing that can happen is that 
it doesn't work. That's why there are 
no malpractice suits. I have never 
heard of any kind of malpractice suit 
involving a.i.d. Ever. Anywhere." 

But someday, Mrs. Holder said, 
someone with a genetic-related disease 
is going to donate sperm to one of the 
commercial donor banks in big cities 
like New York. 

"You come in otT the Bowery to 
donate, and they ask you if you've got 
diabetes. If you say 'Yes' you don't get 
paid money. So you say 'No.' It's exact-
ly what happens in commercial blood 
banks-every now and then somebody 
gets hepatitis because they didn't check 
very carefully about the donors. The 
kid is born with a genetic disease that 
could have been prevented, and some-
body's going to sue the doctor that got 
the semen for malpractice. Why it 
hasn't happened already I don't know, 
because I'm sure the situation has 
arisen." 

There is one area 
m 
which 
a.i.d.-related 
lawsuits are being 
brought: 

"When the couple gets divorced ten 
years later, the issue of child support 
comes up," Mrs. Holder explained. 
"And he says, 'I'm not going to support 
it, because it's not mine.' Now, courts 
basically make him do it; but what's 
happened is that states have passed 
statutes requiring husbands to consent 
in writing. I labored over our consent 
forms- and that's not to protect us 
from a malpractice suit. That's to pro-
tect this kid, if his daddy decides to 
take a walk ten years on."

Maureen Pendergast wants children. 
"It's an obsession," she said. "I have 
a hard time looking at babies- I just 
want to grab the kid and run. I really 
do. I'd take one that fell from the sky at 
midnight- I'm really not fussy. If my 
husband and I are walking somewhere 
and I see somebody go by who's preg-
nant, I'll say, 'Oh, doesn't she look nice. 
What a nice outfit. I wonder how preg-
nant she is?' I'm like that." 

Mrs. Pendergast (a pseudonym) is 
in her early 30s. She is a special educa-
tion teacher at a New Haven area 
public school. For the past two and a 
half years she and her husband have 
organized their lives around basal 
temperature charts and twice-monthly 
artificial inseminations at 
Dr. 
DeChemey's office. One time, she 
stole away 
from their home on 
"My husband felt that If It 
couldn't be our own child, 
then It shouldn't be one of 
ours." 
Christmas morning and down to Yale-
New Haven Hospital and back without 
being detected by their guests. 

"I couldn't believe DeCherney would 
go into his office on Christmas," Mrs. 
Pendergast said. "He's just outstanding 
-his expertise, his personality, his 
manner. I'm grateful I live in the New 
Haven area." 

At present, the Pendergasts are still 
trying with artificial insemination, and 
Mrs. 
Pendergast 
is 
on 
DeCherney's waiting list for in vitro fer-
tilization. She also hopes to adopt. The 
one thing Mrs. Pendergast is not going 
to try, although it would be perhaps 
her best chance of having children, is 
artificial insemination by donor. 

"My husband felt that if it couldn't 
be our own child, then it shouldn't be 
one of ours," she explained. "He wasn't 
quite sure how he'd feel about a child 
that was mine, in that sense, and not 
his. I have to respect that- I think it's 
tougher on a man to have an infertility 
problem. It's not the sort of thing you 
announce at a cocktail party. Women 
will talk about it amongst themselves-
no sweat- but I don't think men can 
ever quite open a conversation about 
how they're having infertility prob-
lems. 

"Under Catholic Church law-and I 
know this because somebody had the 
gall to tell me-l could divorce my 
husband, get an annulment because he 
is technically incapable of giving me 
kids without all this extraordinary 
medical intervention. 
And I 
find 
that .. . 

'"I mean, it's something you think 
about. I could marry somebody else, 
and I could have children, because I'm 
capable of having children. It makes 
for great fantasy stuff- you know, 
down moments- but I wouldn't do it. 
Yet the same Church that would never 
give me an argument about dumping 
the man I have professed to love with

all my heart for nine years would have 
the gall to look me askance for doing 
some 'unnatural' thing in order to have 
a child." 

Mrs. Pendergast definitely wants to 
raise her child as a Catholic, although 
she doesn't consider herself very 
religious. 

"I wouldn't really feel bad in a 
religious 
sense, 
ethical 
if 
DeCherney fertilized an egg from my 
body and decided it wasn't viable and 
chose not to implant it," she said. "At 
that point, you're eliminating some-
thing that's more potential than actual. 
I wouldn't feel I'd participated in a 
crime. so· I don't hold with that argu-
ment against in vitro fertilization." 

Asked about amniocentesis, Mrs. 
Pendergast answered, "That's 
something I just block out. I don't 
know if I'd even want to have the test. I 
don't know what my husband's feelings 
would be-that something we haven't 
discussed. But I just couldn't abort a 
baby- that's something I would fight 
for. I would defend that one to the hilt. 

"As a special ed teacher, at least I'd 
have some background," she went on. 
"I wouldn't look to adopt an excep-
tional kid; but if I had one of my own 
I'd think, 'Maybe there's a purpose to 
my receiving this child.'" 

Mr. Pendergast's infertility is a com-
plication of his diabetes. Although his 
sperm count is normal, a retrograde 
ejaculation problem tends to weaken 
them. Both artificial insemination and 
in vitro fertilization, by reducing the 
distance the sperm must travel, can in-
crease the Pendergasts' chances for 
conception. 

Since, as a diabetic, Mr. Pendergast 
may eventually have health deteriora-
tion 
(such as cardiovascular and 
kidney problems, common complica-
tions of diabetes), it is possible that the 
Pendergasts will be denied an adoptive 
child. Since diabetes is thought to 
be hereditary, it is possible that a child 
conceived by the Pendergasts through 
artificial insemination or in vitro fer-
tilization might develop diabetes in 
childhood, or as an adult. And, since 
the Pendergasts were informed of this 
risk by Dr. DeCherney, the decision to 
go ahead with artificial insemination 
and in vitro fertilization is medically 
and legally considered theirs to make. 

"In some sense, I think we're playing 
wtth the natural laws of selection," 
Mrs. Pendergast said. "There are no 
two ways about it. But, on the other 
hand, it's almost like asking my hus-
band, 'If you had a choice between be-
ing a diabetic and not being here, 
which would you choose?' As diseases 
go, diabetes is no picnic: there are many 
serious complications. But I have 
hopes for the future- for my husband, 


for a diabetic child that I'd have. I 
guess if I were to have six natural kids, 
I'd be pushing my luck. But who's to 
say? 

"Maybe there's an element of 
selfishness, too: that I want a child 
badly enough to take a chance that the 
child might be diabetic. I'd have a 
tough time living with that question, 
Was I too selfish?' 

"I wonder what DeChemey thinks 
about that," she said. "I mean, in some 
instances he's playing with the laws of 
natural selection. In our case, there's a 
disease that could be passed along. 
Now, it's not like a 90 per cent chance 
-I don't think anybody really knows 
what the probability is- but, still, he's 
a medical doctor, and he's possibly 
bringing a person who's unhealthy into 
the world. We didn't really ask a whole 
bunch of questions. I wonder what he 
does think?"
