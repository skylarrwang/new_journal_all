EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
They dug a big hole in the middle of 
Yale. They painted it white and put 
down beige carpets. They put in 
books, they put in desks, and they 
named it Cross Campus Library. 
Everybody makes fun of it. They say 
it looks like a bomb shelter or an airline 
terminal and it smells of smoke or 
spiritual decay or unwashed weenies. 
As one student library worker said, 
"CCL don't get no respect." 
Nonetheless, that hole in Cross 
Campus has come a long way since it 
was dug in 1968. Today it's more than 
a 
well-used library- it's the most 
heterogenous gathering place at Yale. 
On the average weekday night, except 
in February, CCL holds every group 
you can put a label on-jocks and les-
bians, freshman and graduate stu-
dents, a crowd of beautiful people and 
a silent majority of weenies. 


For the regulars in CCL, whether 
they're socialites, weenies or workers, 
the library provides a subterranean 
subculture with its own rules and 
folklore. Socialites tell stories about 
mooning, taking drugs, and holding 
court in CCL. Workers tell stories 
about crazy people they have helped 
(the man who wanted to make a bas-
ketball larger than the New Haven 
Coliseum, or the one who thought 
Communists were attacking his brain). 
Robert, a full-time worker and super-
visor, fondly recalled a rumour that 
those who built CCL had forgotten to 
connect the sewage pipes. "It was a 
good rumour. I know I did my best to 
spread it . . . You 
get your own 
folklore here." Even the weenies con-
tribute to CCL's graffiti. 


Most of the regulars in CCL follow 
unwritten rules. The front section of 
the library is a social center. As you 
walk to the back of the library and 
downstairs, the atmosphere becomes 
more decorous; the area around the 
single study carrels is nearly silent. At 
times, however, the library just isn't 
big enough to accomodate the variety 
of people who use it. 


"I've almost had fights in CCL," a 
senior said, "for being out of control 
and people being angry." On one occa-
sion two years ago, he said, "a guy said 
to me, 'would you shut up.' He was 
much bigger than me, but I was hang-
ing out with jocks." After a few epithets 
were exchanged, one of the jocks 
pulled a switchblade "It was a joke," the 
senior explained. "It wasn't a serious 
threat . . . more bragging to us that he 
had one. Still, pulling a switchblade in 
a tense situation ... " 


Quieter confrontations have oc-
curred this year when a group of men 
have arranged their chairs so they 
could stare at and talk about a group of 
lesbians. Y alesbian Maia Ettinger '83 
said she has never responded actively 
to this treatment. "They're not the peo-
ple we can talk to. Why should we 
waste our energy? We've got work to 
do." 


The library's official functions and 
rules make it a magnet for a variety of 
people. "For a place like Yale, which 
has always been book-oriented, it 
wouldn't make sense to segregate" 
libraries by user, said Head Librarian 
Howard Keith. Instead, Yale has seg-
regated books according to how fre-
quently they are used. CCL's 150,000 
volumes comprise Yale's intensive-use 
collection, with yearly circulation ap-
proaching 250,000. And because it 
holds most of the library system's 
closed and overnight reserve materials, 
CCL is an unavoidable workplace for 
many students who normally shun 
libraries. 


Moreover, 
for serious 
students who smoke,- CCL is a haven 
-the only general library where they 
can satisfy their habit. 


"I like the library," Senior Fred Kauf-
man said. "People don't realize how 
much you can do there. They just sit
around and study. They don't realize 
there's no end to the hubbub you can 
cause without getting into any 
trouble." 


For many of the fun-lovers at the 
front of the library, CCL is a big beige 
playground- a 
place to table-hop, 
gossip, and flirt. Even for the students 
who go to CCL to study, the library af-
fords 
welcome companionship- so 
welcome, in fact, that many have a 
hard time working in it. 


"I come here to socialize. When I 
really have to work, I go to the stacks 
or the Law School. Half the time I'm 
here I spend wandering around talking 
to people I know," Junior George 
Schwab said. "I work in a weenie hole 
so I don't have to listen to people like 
me make noise. When I'm not work-
ing, I make noise." 


CCL is the friendliest library at 
Yale. Its simple design and open spaces 
allow you to spot your friends there 
easily. People who use the library for 
socializing describe it as the only 
general meeting place on campus. 


"CCL is the student pub we don't 
have ... It fulfills a real function," 
Senior Liz Berger said. She added that 
"Yale puts a 
lot of emphasis on 
camaraderie within the college. 
There's no place to see people who 
aren't in your college. 


Berger said she enjoys the mixlUre of 
people in CCL and the occasional 
strange scenes it produces. She recalled 
giving a fashion show there for her new 
leather pants. She paraded through the 
front smoking section, where gay 
students tend to sit, and exclaimed 
"man, what I need is a sugar daddy to 
keep me in leather pants." A student 
turned around and told her, "man, you 
are in the wrong section of CCL for 
that." 


Is there a "right section" in CCL? No 
such luck. "It's a good place to talk to 
people you already know, but if you 
try to pick someone up, it doesn't 
work," a junior said. A senior woman 
said that CCL's innocent reputation, 
paradoxically, encouraged her to seek 
her former boyfriend there shortly after 
they met. "I'd want to see him. I used 
to walk around discretely, look in the 
cubicles. 'Oh, I was just in the 
neighborhood,'" she'd say. '"Do you 
have a pencil? Can I borrow a dime? 
Let's go the Machine City."' She em-
phasized that CCL is "really safe." The 
library provides not only hundreds of 
chaperones but also a wholesome exuse 
for running into a friend. A junior said 
that this is the reason he goes to CCL 
to see the women he's "madly in love 
with." "If I stopped by her room, she'd 
know I'd come to see her. But if I find 
her in CCL, I could just be there to 
study." 


Most of the students in CCL actually 
are there to do their work. People line 
up outside the library before it opens 
on Sundays. The single study carrels 
are all taken early in the evenings and 
during exams, it's sometimes impossi-
ble to find a seat anywhere in the 
library. 


CCL's inflexible deadlines and stiff 
fines (50 cents per quarter hour at clos-
ed reserve) anger many students. 
Serious confrontations between 
workers and students are most likely to 
occur when students can't check out 
the books they need. On a few rare oc-
casions, students have thrown books at 
the library workers. 


Although they don't enjoy this sort 
of abuse, the workers tend to be sym-
pathetic to students' frustration. "Ex-
plosions usually occur around exams," 
said Robert, who's had books thrown 
at him. "You're not really in control at 
that time. You've got finals, and here's 
this person who won't give the book to 
you." He added that people who lose 
their tempers at the library often 
return to apologize, which he ap-
preciates. 


"The situation has grown worse each 
year as the job market tightened up," 
Robert said "When I came here [seven 
years ago) this was a relaxed place." 


Supervisor Linda Mcintyre at-
tributed many confrontations to users' 
ignorance. "A lot of time, it's someone 
who's new to this library and doesn't 
know that fines are strict." She added 
that she seldom waives a fme. 


There are exceptions though. Before 
the new computers made deadlines in-
flexible, a conscientious appearance 
could help you avoid a fme. Student 
worker John Findar recalled "a very 
gaunt Divinity Student in a long cloak. 
His face was ashen, his eyes were 
sunken, deep dark wells. He was very 
soft-spoken. He walked up to the desk 
and said, 'I'd like to pay my fine.' I said 
'that'll be 25c,' and he said, 'I don't 
usually get fines, but my cat was sick 
and I couldn't leave her.' He was about 
to pay, but for my own sportsmanship, 
I decided to pursue the matter. I said, 
'why didn't you get a friend to take care 
of her?' He said, 'oh, no, that would be 
quite impossible. You see, I have no 
friends.' I said, 'oh well, in that case, 
no fine.'" 


Confrontations are nothing new for 
CCL. The library was a subject of 
dispute long before it was built. The 
architectural firm of Edward L. Barnes 
originally suggested that the under-
ground library be lit by raised skylights 
covering much of Cross Campus. 
After President Kingman Brewster 
and other Corportation members ob-
jected to this plan, the architects decid-
ed that CCL should instead be lit by 
two strips of ground-level skylights, 
with little trees planted between them 
and an overhead canopy of leaves. 
When this plan was unveiled in The 
New Journal in April 1968, it im-
mediately provoked protest. A Yale 
Daily News editorial thundered that "it 
would scarcely be no less of a desecra-
tion to construct a hamburger stand in 
the middle of the New Haven Green 
that to trade in the turf on the Cross 
Campus for footage of granite and 
glass." A Committee to Save the Cross 
Campus sent thousands of letters to 
alumni asking them to protest the 
plans, 
and its 
petitions quickly 
garnered 4000 signatures. 


Nevertheless, on the morning of 
April 23 a bulldozer crawled onto the 
Cross Campus to tear up two trees. It 
was stopped by hundreds of students 
who surrounded the trees until 
Presidential Assistant Henry 
Chauncey arrived and sent the work 
crews home, promising no excavation 
without notification. In keeping with 
the spirit of the times, the protest had 
its own song and the Committee to 
Save the Cross Campus held a sym-
bolic planting to "show our concem 
and commitment to preserving the 
grassy area. •

Scully gave aesthetic authority to the 
protesters' outrage. Although he was
