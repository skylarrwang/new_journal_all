EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Looking back over our six cover stories, we think they represent in part what we're trying to do. We've tried to cover issues and people at Yale that affect the way we live and think. 

We started with David Chapell's piece on Yale research and the Defense Department. Then Andy Court profiled New Haven policeman Rick Randall. An interview with former Black Panther and Yale College junior Kathleen Cleaver followed, and in January, Hampton Sides analysed the rhetorical stalemate between President Giamatti and the Moral Majority. In February, our fifth issue highlighted Paul Hofheinz's analysis of the agreement between Yale's blue collar union and the administration. 

Our cover story this issue follows in this path. David Frum, conservative columnist for the Yale Daily News, is perhaps the most controversial undergraduate at Yale this year. We decided to cover Frum not because we necessarily agree with his views, but because we are interested in someone who claims to be representing "the 20 per cent (of Yalies) who voted for Reagan." Frum says he's challenging sloppy, unquestioning liberal outlooks here. Some of his critics, however, claim his thinking is just as sloppy as those he condemns. 

This issue, our sixth, is our last for the year. We'll be back next year with six more, but we'd like to take this opportunity to thank some of our people who are graduating. 

Two folks chiefly responsible for the way TNJ looks are our designer Matt Gaynor and our photography editor Rollin Riggs, both of whom have had work published recently in the New York Times. Neither is exactly sure of his post-graduation plans, but Riggs is working on a student's guide to spring break in Florida, which will be published by Arbor House in December. Gaynor suggested the possibility of "getting trashed- for about three years." 

Four fine writers and regular contributors are also graduating this year. Walter Jacob, who wrote on teaching evaluations, tenure, and career advisory, has the ability to identify important stories and then locate the most interesting angle to pursue. Holly Lyman demonstrates in this issue's story on Cross Campus Library what she showed in an earlier profile on George Schoolfield: the wonderful and rare ability to listen. Matt Hamel's incredible eye for detail came through in his piece on the floormen of Toad's, and his profile of Charles Black. Finally, Martha Neil took a creative and unusual approach to her article this issue on "The Fertility Service" at Yale-New Haven hospital. 

On the business side, Jeff Foster and Geoff Pope have both been with the magazine since the beginning. As Business Manager, Foster has been actively involved in formulating our advertising strategy and monitoring our finances. Pope has been one of our veteran advertising reps. 

We'd also like to mention one freshman who has begun brilliantly, Hilary Callahan. Hilary became our production manager last issue. She and her production staff put the magazine together without a hitch, and we hope they will continue the good work in the future. 

Look for us in September.
