on the ground floor, and smaller rooms 
for bunks and lockers above. The site 
for the building is a location which 
Venturi considers "at the edge of 
downtown, and the city's buildings jut 
up above the low buildings in the 
foreground. 

Also, the firehouse is 
located at the spot Goffe Street 
doglegs; 
the street comes directly 
toward the building and then turns to 
head more toward the city. 

Rather than slavishly accomodate to 
these pressures in an act of passive con-
textual ism, 
Ventu ri 
wilfu lly 
manipulates apd carefully exploits the 
·pressures to his own advantage. It's a 
sort of architectural jujitsu. 

Venturi set the building back from 
the street at an angle so that it directly 
confronts your vision when you drive 
toward town on Goffe Street. From 
this position the billboard facade takes 
on new characteristics. In its flat 
stretched horizontal state it now acts 
like a base, providing a clean line 
above which the tall buildings beyond 
rise prominently. The weight of the 
buildings pushes down on the fire sta-
tion giving it strength. The energy of 
that compression acts with the bold let-
ters on the facade, which read from left 
to right, visually pushing the building 
toward Goffe Street as it passes by. 

The disengaged wall at the right takes 
that m ovement and inflects it up over 
the traffic, suggesting a great portal in-
to the city- not one standing directly 
over the street, but one next to it like 
ancient Babylonian gateways with the 
lions to either side. 

The fenestration further supports 
this reading since the second story 
locker room windows with their square 
design, appear to spring from the large 
square bay doors on the first floor. Of 
similar shape but smaller in size, the 
windows move up and to the right out 
over the traffic taking with them the 
disengaged wall as if pulled ofT by the 
turbulence of speeding cars down in 
Tom SrrongrThe New Joumal 
the roadway. 

Venturi's approach 
gives 
the 
building greater power than one would 
have expected from a building of such 
small size and limited scope. By 
skillfully addressing aspects inherent in 
the context, Venturi achieves results 
far richer than had he ignored it all and 
acted hermetically like the Modem ar-
chitectS with which he contrasts 

himself. Says Vincent Scully, "Contex-
tually, I think it's terrific. I mean the 
context there-the towers of Yale and 
the ridge line to the west of the city . . . 
and the opening of the space! Its 
velocity is terrific!" Indeed, the 
building absorbs a lot from its surroun-
dings, and offers back even more in 
return.
