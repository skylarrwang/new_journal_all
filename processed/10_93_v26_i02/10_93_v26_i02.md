tudents under age 21 don't get turned away at the 
door. They enter the dimly lit, noisy 'room and imme-
diately push their way to the bar. Arms outstretched, 
they wait for the tap of Milwaukee's Best to slosh into their 
plastic cups. Foaming beer in hand, they survey the scene. 
Spotting some familiar faces, they jostle their way back into 
the crowd and yell to their friends over the deafening strains 
of the Dead. All the while they scan for that cute someone 
who smiled at them two days ago in history section, and 
who just might be out tonight. 

It's not Demery's, Naples, or Sigma Nu. It's the Beach 
Club, a large suite in Silliman, hosting one of its five-keg 
parties. And the Beach Club is just one of a host of rooms 
well known around campus for their catchy names and their 
seminal role in the Yale social scene. On nights when these 
rooms throw parties, hundreds of students pack into their 
spacious common rooms, then overflow into the entryway 
and the courtyard. 

Last year, the Beach Club residents threw about 16 par-
ties. Four hundred students came to the largest one, which 
featured a live band and six and a half kegs. But only about 
lived in the Beach Club last year too, said he spent about 
$200 on alcohol for parties. Still, he said the worst part of 
living in the Beach Club is cleaning the bathroom after par-
ties. "I also don't like the smell of beer that hangs around for 
a few days," he added. 

Before the air has time to clear, friends ask when the 
next party is. Call it the price of living in a room with a ~ 
doorbell (the Beach Club), a kitchen (the Bat Cave in ~ 
Silliman) or in a suite with two floors (Book World in ~ 
Calhoun and the Cottage). It is not just a tradition for ~ 
occupants of these rooms to throw parties. It is a social obli- -., 
gation. "You have something to live up to," Derek ~ 
Hausladen (DC '94) said. But the obligation has its ~ 
rewards. "The easiest way to meet people is to stand by a ·5 
keg and pour beer," Hausladen said. "Soon everybody ~ 
knows your name." 

T
he first Monday of each new semester is "Tequila ~ 
Monday" at the Beach Club and the Bat Cave. The .g

Club parties. "It's so hard to get 
a beer here," because of the 
number of people, said resident 
Matt Bierbaum (SM '95). 
Instead, "most people get ham-
mered beforehand and come 
here after to hang out." 
Residents of these rooms 
have to be willing to stack their 
furniture in a corner, discard 
their privacy, and open their 
suite to whomever shows up, 
even the student who came to a ---::::..oo-

this year wearing an inflatable 
moose around his waist. And 
Kate Battle (SY '95), a former 
resident of the Saybrook Beach, 
said she and her roommates had 
to kick people out of their bed-
rooms during parties in their 
eight-person suite.

Beach Club around 9 p.m. on Tequila 
Monday of this year, and asked if he 
was in the right place for the blue

mates told the student, "Yes, but it 
doesn't start for an hour." When he 
carne back an hour later, blue book in 
hand, he found the kegs tapped and 
the tequila flowing.

admitted that the players on the team 
at bat were the only ones completely 
naked. "You could wear your boxers 
when you were fielding," he explained. 

The chance to live in a suite with 
a triple-sized common room, (the 
Beach Club, the Bat Cave, and the 
God Quad), or one with a long, wood-
en bar, (the Beach Club and the God 
Quad) can spur competition in the 
room draw. Bat Cave resident Hien 
Tran (SM '94) said she thought some-
one offered one of her roommates 
money if she would forego living in 
the room. Saybrugian Battle and her 
roommates, the first women in years

Quad residents will either be chosen in 
a special early draw or in an election 
for some kind of social chairperson, 
which would clarify the God Quad's 
role as the center of Branford's social 
life. 

These rooms have not always 
smelled of beer. The Bat Cave and the 
Beach Club started out inauspiciously 
as fellow's suites and later became stu-
dent rooms. Former Silliman fellow 
Steve Gillon, who taught history at 
Yale until last year, left a legacy to the 
occupants of the Beach Club, where 
B
ook World also draws its name 
from its centerpiece. About four 
years ago when a New Haven 
bookstore called "Book World" closed 
its doors, the students who then lived 
in Calhoun 426-427 bought the store's 
neon sign. Too large to fit through the 
door, they hoisted it up four floors and 
hauled it through a window. The Bat 
Cave's name comes from a mysterious, 
sealed closet in the room's hallway. 
Someone once likened it to a cave 
where bats would be likely to live. She 
said she thinks the closet is filled with 
asbestos, but the name stuck. The

Between the dark span of the Atlantic Ocean and the 
shallow waters of the Chesapeake Bay lies a narrow 
strip of land known tp Marylanders as the Eastern 
Shore. It is a land of cornfields fringed by fishing villages 
and resort towns, isolated by 30. miles of water and three 
centuries of history from the ~rban sprawl across the Bay. 
For the acclaimed writer Christopher Tilghman (TC '68), it 
is home ground, a place filled with family history and child-
hood memories, and the source of the values that inspire his 
work. 


"My stories have always been filled with a keen sense of 
place," Tilghman says, speaking over the phone from his 
home outside Boston, "with people who are attached to 
land, to nature, and to their families." This sense of history 
and tradition led critics to hail In a Father's Place, 
Tilghman's first collection of stories, as one of the most dis-
tinctive and unusual books of 1990. Michiko Kakutani 
(SM '76) of the New York Times wrote, "Many of 
Tilghman's people come to see their lives not only in terms 
of their immediate families, but also in terms of generations 
within the arc of history." The importance of personal his-
tory in his work, Tilghman says, is rooted in his own experi-
ence. 


The Tilghman family has lived on the Eastern Shore 
since 1650, when a surgeon named Richard Tilghman came 
to Maryland to escape the English Civil War. "The gover-
nor of Maryland gave him a grant of land by the Chester 
River," Tilghman says. "Our family place is on that same 
land." By Tilghman's childhood in the 50s, most of the 
family had moved away from the farm. His father chose to 
continue the family tradition on the Shore, running the 
family farm during the summer while working as a publish-
er in Boston for the rest of the year. Tilghman spent his 
summers in a decaying mansion filled with portraits of his 
ancestors and legends of family ghosts. When not working 
on the farm, he sailed the rivers and creeks of the Shore. 


"I got to see the different cultures of the Shore dose-
up," he says. "The kids I hung around with were the chil-
dren of farmhands, and we'd talk to the seine-hauler fisher-
men who worked on the river." He sensed the age-old ten-
sions of the Shore-between black and white, rich and 
poor, watermen and farmers. In his story "On the 
Rivershore," he wrote about the murder of a Shore fisher-
man by a farmer, and an aging landowner who tries to 
resolve the dispute. "I never witnessed any such dramatic 
event," he says, "but a child absorbs a lot from the attitudes 
of people around him." Over time, he became an accom-
plished sailor and grew to love the water. In his stories, even 
when he changes names of places on the Shore, he never 
alters the details of the waterways. "I remember them too 
well," he says. "Those rivers were as much a home to me as 
the land was." 


Yet Tilghman has always been a visitor to the Eastern 
Shore, part of the first generation of }:lis family that has 
never lived there. For a time, he forgot his roots. "All 
through my early years as a writer," he says, "I had no idea 
of the effect the Eastern Shore had on me." Rediscovering 
the bonds of family and land brought him to write the sto-
ries of In a Fathers Place. In many ways, he was returning 
home. 


Tilghman began his writing career a thousand miles 
from Maryland, on a Navy supply ship in the 
Atlantic. He had been drafted during his senior year 
at Yale, and became a navigator for the Navy three months 
after graduation. At sea, he wrote "volumes" in his jour-
nal-"most of it enraged," he says-and decided to write 
fiction when he was discharged. He had done some writing 
as a child and in high school, but at Yale he was more inter-
ested in music. Being at sea for nearly three years changed 
his perspective. In his story "Norfolk, 1969," he wrote 
about a young sailor who comes to love the sea despite his 
disgust for the military. "The farther the jupiter plowed 
toward the center of the ocean, the more an elemental soul 
asserted itself, swells of time, growing over a million square 
miles," he wrote. "None of the anguishes of that age, none 
of the compromises that had been forced upon him, none 
of the political confusions in his head, mattered anymore." 


In the story, his love for the sea drives a wedge between 
the sailor and his pacifist wife, who finally leaves him when 
he is away. "I wasn't in that situation exactly," Tilghman 
says, "but the conflict was the same-between my political 
feelings and the majesty of the sea." Like the sailor in his 
story, he found something timeless and transcendent in his 
experience on the ocean. He began writing to capture that 
sense of wonder. "It's one of the greatest privileges of being a 
writer," he says, "to be able to spend your time dealing with 
these great mysteries, with this sense of astonishment at 
life." 


Many years passed before Tilghman reached maturity 
as a writer and began to publish. "When I began writing in 
1971," he says, "I had my head full of the French-the crit-
ical theory that I studied in college." His years at Yale came 
at an important juncture in modern literary criticism, when 
the theories of Levi-Strauss, Derrida, and the Marxist critics 
gained prominence. The new methodologies influenced his 
first efforts at a novel. "It was a wildly intellectual enter-
prise," he says, "and not any good at all." After working on 
the novel for six years, he abandoned it and turned to short 
fiction. He found his whole approach to writing changing. 
"I realized I wanted to write about people, not vast theoreti-
cal constructs," he says. "Fiction is not a product of the 
intellect." According to Tilghman, fiction writers have to be 
"dumb"-they have to work from the heart and the gut 
instead of the brain. His stories became more personal, 
reflecting his own experiences as a sailor, as a ranch hand in 
Montana, and as a young husband and father. It was 
inevitable that he would eventually come to write about the 
Eastern Shore. "That was the turning point," he says, "when 
my writing-and in many ways my life--came full circle." 


His current project is a novel, set on the Eastern Shore 
in the 30s. The novel began as a short story, but he found 
there was too much to say. "It calls on many of the experi-
ences I' had as a child," he says. Working in a longer frame-
work allows him to present a larger view of the culture of 
the Shore from different perspectives: watermen and farm-
ers, whites and blacks. "I feel like a kid in a candy store," he 
says about writing the novel. "It's really given me a chance 
to get back to the things I'm closest to." 


In the end, it seems entirely fitting that writing has 
brought Tilghman to appreciate his own background 
and his own history. "Writing for me has always been a 
process of exploration," he says. "You put down everything 
you know and try to discover some connection, some expla-
nation for why things happen." The search for understand-
ing takes place in many of his stories-a sailor finding con-
solation for his loneliness in the ocean, a young man return-
ing to his family ranch to try to understand his parents. 
One reviewer called the search "the desire of his characters 
to reckon with their lives as a whole." In Tilghman's view, it 
is the most important thing anyone can do. "We have to 
explore these things," he says. "It's the only way we'll ever 
understand just what we're doing here."

Yale's Orphaned Art 
Kate Schuler 
The Women's Table joins Yale s collection of public art. 
0 
n October 1, hundreds of students, faculty, and 
alumni gathered to celebrate the dedication of what 
Yale President Richard Levin (GRD '74) called "a 
beautiful vision and remarkable artistic achievement." 
The Women's Table, a sculpture by Maya Y. Lin (SY '81, ARC 
'86) celebrating the contributions of women at Yale, was 
unveiled in front of Sterling Memorial Library. President 
Levin, former President Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. (TC '63, 
LAW '66), and Provost Judith Rodin (GRD '79) spoke, and 
Whim'n Rhythm sang at the ceremony. With such fanfare 
surrounding its installation, and the disruptions caused by 
its construction, the sculpture has caught the attention of 
the entire Yale campus. 

The Womens Table, a 32-ton granite sculpture and 
fountain, celebrates the role of women at Yale. Digits 
engraved in the circular granite surface catalogue the num-
ber of women matriculating at Yale each year since the 
school's founding. The dates begin in 1701 and stop at 
1993; future numbers will not be added. In a few years, or 
even a few months, when the fanfare and the hype die 
down, when the name of the artist and the tide of her work 
are forgotten, when its meaning is no longer publicly exalt-
ed, what will become of this multi-million dollar project? 
Rodin, addressing the issue of the possible treatment of the 
sculpture said, "I think people will recognize the meaning of 
this, the welcoming and inclusive nature of the sculpture 
and walkways. I hope people will treat it kindly and rever-
entially." 

If the treatment of many past acquisitions is any indica-
ro THE N£w JouRNAL 
tion of the fate of Maya Lin's work, the piece will need more 
than just Rodin's hopes and assurances. Before the Lin 
sculpture was unveiled, there were rumors of plans for beer 
slides atop the installation, and one student predicted The 
Womens Table would become a "big student birdbath." 

Such treatment would follow consistently Yale's tradition of 
disrespect and apathy towards its public art. 

Claes Oldenburg (SM '50) intended his sculpture, 
Lipstick on Caterpillar Tracks, to draw controversy. One of 
the more prominent works on campus, it has garnered the 
attention of students since its installation in 1969. The 
occasion drew a crowd of over a thousand onto Beinecke 
Plaza. Oldenburg and a group of students who had helped 
commission the sculpture hoped the piece would act as a 
rallying point and gathering place. The artist originally 
intended the lipstick to be inflatable so that students could 
raise it during important events or to announce a speech. 
Although the original vision did not succeed (structural 
problems demanded that the vinyl and wood be replaced by 
steel, aluminum, and fiberglass), students found many uses 
for the giant landmark. In the turbulent years of the late 60s 
and early 70s, the lipstick served as a podium and kiosk for 
radical groups like Students for a Democratic Society. Zero 
Population Growth sheathed the lipstick with a huge plastic 
bag, and opponents of the piece reportedly tried to pour lye 
on it to quicken its deterioration. Since the lipstick's reloca-
tion to Morse College, students have found less radical uses 
for the sculpture; it has become more a joke and catalyst for 
pranks than anything else. Nevertheless, history of art pro-
fessor Vincent Scully OE '40) interprets the postering and 
graffiti on the Oldenburg sculpture as congruous with the 
original purpose. He exalts the sculpture as "a functioning 
work of art." Citing the Oldenburg sculpture as an example 
of a work intended to incite reaction, he explains. "Art is 
always for a response. The lipstick extracts a reaction; myths 
are built around it." The Women's Table differs in style and 
intent and, therefore, according to Scully, will differ in its 
role on campus. "The lipstick is very approachable. The 
Maya Lin piece is a different style, a different type of work 
altogether." 

The fate and condition of these and other works of 
public art on campus relies on the judgment of students and 
administrators. "The way public art is kept up is a reflection 
of the way people feel about it," says Scully. "If they like it 
they will respect it; if they hate it they'll trash it." 

OCTOBER 15, 1993 


This sentiment does not account for apathy towards the 
works, which is probably more common than real emotion 
either way. The kind of treatment most sculptures receive is 
not motivated by politics or an attempt to make a statement 
about the nature of the artwork itself. Rather, sculpture at 
Yale often goes unnoticed, ignored, or at most used for pri-
vate intentions and pranks. 

Susan Frankenbach, registrar of the Yale University Art 
Gallery, commented that public sculpture is for use by the 
community "as long as the integrity of the object is upheld." 
Some recent acts have overstepped this boundary. About 
three years ago, a group of students wrapped a sheet around 
the head of a Henry Moore bronze statue in the gallery's 
sculpture garden and then set it on fire. Last spring, stu-
dents climbed plowed piles of snow on Beinecke Plaza to 
reach the blades of Alexander Calder's stabile Gallows and 
Lollipops and used masking tape to form the initials of their 
"The way public art is kept up is a 
reflection of the way people feel about 
it. If they like it they will respect it; if 
they hate they'll trash it. " 
singing group. While these may seem like minor and harm-
less pranks, such acts may permanently damage already 
fragile works of art. 

Mark Aronson, an an conservator at the gallery who 
removed the masking tape from the Calder stable, explained 
that removing the tape removed some of the pigment as 
well. Outlines of the initials remained, especially where blue 
pigment was used. It is not a simple matter to repair or 
paint over the damage. Certain ethics come into play when 
restoring damaged works. Since original brushstrokes can-
not be replicated and the exact pigment cannot be matched, 
the conservator must weigh the value of preserving as much 
of the original work as possible versus ensuring its longevity. 
The Calder has not yet been repaired; officials are investi-
gating the cost of repair and trying to decide whether or not 
to replace the original matte sheen of the stabile with a 
more durable gloss finish. While these issues may not seem 
vital to the everyday workings of the university, they do 
involve a financial, as well as aesthetic, accounting; vandal-
ism greatly diminishes the work's value. As Frankenbach 
said, a damaged work is "only a shadow of its former self." 

The Calder stabile, installed in 1960, was already in 
delicate condition before last year's incident. Aronson said, 
"The damage placed further stress on an already fragile 
0crOBER 15, 1993 
piece." He explained that the university was looking into 
repairs not simply to flX the damage from the masking tape, 
but also to remedy long-term deterioration of the piece that 
the investigation uncovered, deterioration caused by envi-
ronmental conditions and normal wear and tear. 

Any outdoor sculpture is destined to be worn and 
weathered and will need repairs on a regular basis. Yet Yale 
makes no provision for periodic maintenance checks on the 
condition of the outdoor collection; subtle damage often 
goes unseen. Frankenbach says the art gallery must "rely on 
other people to be our eyes"-that is, Yale assumes others 
will report any damage. Aronson acknowledges that the 
sculptures should be washed once or rwice a year and the 
bronzes should be waxed annually; the gallery, however, 
lacks the staff and funds to regularly maintain the collec-
tion. 

I 
ncidents such as the damage to the Calder stabile clearly 
indicate that art around campus does not always receive 
the respectful treatment it would command if it were 
not located in a gallery. Gallery security supervisor Lynn 
Fitzgerald commented that outright malice has not caused 
damage to any of the works recently, but rather the careless-
ness of"students who weren't thinking." 

While the art gallery and university administrators have 
legitimate complaints when they bemoan the lack of con-
cern for art on campus, they seem co take a passive role in 
the outdoor sculptures' welfare. There are no labels or plac-
ards on the sculptures to help students identify the artists or 
interpret the work. While the university seems to have 
made an effort to bring the works of great artists to campus, 
Th~ Cakkr stabik installation draws glanus .from pass~nby.

Guitar Man stands by the Co-op, baseball cap backwards, instrument in hand, and his case wide open

"Hey Cliff!" someone waves. 

Without skipping a beat he bids a good afternoon and 
goes right on singing "Kansas City Baby." Students often 
say they never hear him play anything else. 

Clifford H. Byrd, born and raised in New Haven, is a 
familiar face on Broadway. I often hear students mention 
the Guitar Man in dining hall conversations: "Who is he?" 
people ask, "I've always wanted to talk to that man." "He's 
the only guy on the street I give money to." All seem to agree 
that he's different from the others that frequent the sidewalk. 
He has a certain energy about him. 

"Sure I'll help you with the article," he says as he leans 
on a newspaper dispenser. "Some brother wanted to write a 
book about my life once .... You know what I can do for you? 
You want to write a book? Honey, can I tell you stories .... " I 
smell alcohol on his breath. 

"You see, tomorrow's Friday and I have to work real 
hard so I can make enough money for a ticket and cab 
to go see my girl. If you can spare anything, I really 
need it. She's in prison, and she needs me. 

They only let me see her twice a week, and when she sees me 
that gives her hope to live ... it keeps her strong." He points to 
his guitar. "Right now, that's my only way." 

"I've heard you give guitar lessons," I say. 

"I sure do. Don't have anyone at the moment, but if you 
know anyone .... I need the money to go see my girl. She's a 
beautiful, lovely flower ... I love her." Cliff pauses. "When she 
gets out we're gonna be married." He tilts his head to the 
side and talks about her for a while. "I got her off drugs. 
She'd been busted for drugs and escaped, but she's straight 
now. She's gonna be OK. You know what? I put her there ... I 
busted my own lady for her own good, because I seen her ......, 
running out of motivation. When she comes home I'll keep 
her away from that old environment ... she's had her ups and 
downs but she'll be OK; she's into the Lord now." 

"You believe in God?" I ask. 

Cliff breaks into a ten minute speech about the Lord 
Jesus and God's everlasting Grace and forgiveness. He plays 
piano at church every Sunday and reads the Bible nearly 
every day. I ask him 
where he finds his 
faith. 

"you see 
that tree over there? 
Man can make a lot 
of things, but no 
matter what, he 
can't make a liv-
ing, 
breathing 
tree, and man 
can't create those 
stars and the 
moon. He can 
only make a 
replica. So I 
know. 

I 
may 
be 
smokin' 
this 
cigarette, and drinkin' a little wine, but 
God still loves me for what I am." 

"I don't do drugs because that 
ain't cool. But I've been there," 
he says. "I almost died off of 
drugs .... My heart was going 'BOOM 
BOOM BOOM,' and my head felt 
like a pumpkin, and I said, 'Yo buddy, 
something ain't right. This stuff's 
killing me."' Cliff feels that God gave 
him another chance to live. "We all 
got a right to live, but if you throw it 
away, then consider it thrown." 

He tells me he was on coke. "At 
the time I thought that was really hap-
penin'," he drawls. "I was young ... I 
didn't care about dying ... I wanted 
guns ... I wanted money .... Thank God I 
didn't kill no one. I've never killed any-
one. When I was in Vietnam I didn't 
kill no one either. I'm a Vietnam vet 
you know, honest to God. 

"I'm not a hoodlum like some of 
my brothers, God bless them. I see my 
brothers on the street with ten dollars 
to rush to get a fix." He says he's differ-
ent and wants people to see it. He says 
he's not a beggar, just a man trying to 
make a living with his guitar." 

I ask him how he started playing 
the guitar: he explains that music was 
his first love. As a boy he would listen 
to his grandfather play gospel music-
and the blues, when his grandmother 
wasn't listening. Cliff has loved music 
ever since. God gave him a gift, he says, 
the gift to play any instrument. He's a 
self-taught guitarist with perfect pitch 
and a photographic memory. "I'm not 
bragging," he insists. "It's something 
God gave me." 

Cliff says he's never had to "beck-
on down to white supremacy." "I'm 
not in college, but I know what that is. 
I'm an American black man, and thank 
God I'm not in Africa with them lions. 
I stand on my own, and that's my way. 

"I respect myself so others can 
respect me too, and if you treat others 
like you want them to treat you, then 
nothing goes wrong. I love what I do .... 
I can be a millionaire tomorrow with 
my guitar. Everyone here's got a 
chance." 

"You really believe that?" I ask 
with some skepticism. 

"You have to help yourself-
that's 
all it takes. I mean, look at you and me, 
we can write that book." I laugh. 

"That's why all the nationalities come 
around here .... But I'm a realist, the 
white man is running this country. You 
should know it," he waves his hand 
towards me. "They're using your peo-
ple as a trade country." I'm Korean-
American. "They know you guys are 
makin' the dollars ... I don't have to go 
to Yale to know that. America needs 
that trade ... that's why they're being so 
sweet and kind. 

Otherwise, they 
wouldn't have time for you, as they 
don't have for some in this country that 
need help. There's a lot of people here 
that need help and don't get it." 

"Hi Cliff." Two students 
come by. "I've got some-
thing for you." One of 
them hands him a five dollar bill. 

"Hey, you know, I got a song for 
you tonight," he says and breaks into 
the blues. He cracks a few jokes in 
between refrains and his audience of 
two laughs good naturedly. After the 
song he asks if we enjoyed it. 

"Very much," one of the students 
reply. 

"Then that made me enjoy it too," 
he bows. 

After they leave he turns to me. "I 
love them. God bless them. Not 
because he gave me five dollars," Cliff 
insists. "Because he's a human being. It 
doesn't matter what color you are, we're 
all brothers and sisters under God. 

Without God in your soul, you're 
among the living dead." 

Evidently, I'm not the first student 
to approach him. Some upper-
classmen know him and even 
play guitar with him on occasion. Cliff 
tells me he's seen students come and go 
after years at Yale. 

"My friend in Switzerland wrote 
me a letter and says when he comes 
back he'll buy me chicken, because he 
knows I love chicken." Cliff has a 
throaty laugh. "That made me feel 
good. You know why? 'cause he knows 
me." 

Kansas City, here I come. 

As it gets dark, I shiver and notice 
the evening chill. With a hand-
shake and a friendly smile, Cliff 
and I part company. 

"See you 
around," he says. Walking away, I 
begin to wonder what exactly it means 
to know someone. How many people 
know Cliff as more than just Guitar 
Man, as more than just the indigenous 
figure on the Broadway sidewalk? 

How many imagine that the Guitar 
Man in front of the Co-op with a 
cigarette dangling from his mouth 
could also be a political commentator, 
a self-rehabilitated anti-drug activist, 
and a God-fearing advocate of the 
Golden Rule? Everyone's got a story. 
Sometimes, all it takes to find out is a 
willingness to look deeper than an 
open guitar case.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the outskirts of rhe city, in a dingy second-story 
room, three friends dress for battle in the late summer 
heat. Red padding covers heads and groins, and gloves 
slide over carefully raped fists. Smiles turn to scowls. In one 
month, these three will be fighting for state championships in 
separate weight classes. Today, under the watchful eye of their 
trainer, theY. will rake turns pummeling each other. 

This second-floor room is the home of Ring One, New 
Haven's one and only boxing gym. The trainer, 34-year-old 
Brian Clarke, is at the moment standing amidst the combat-
ants, lacing their gloves. He could hardly look more out of 
place. Brian's got long blond hair and the chiseled features of a 
Last Action Hero. It's only when he speaks, something he is 
known ro do for hours on e·nd, that his boxing expertise and 
his deep commitment to his fighters surface. Brian is part 
inner-city activist, parr boxing coach. The activist Brian will 
talk passionately about "keeping kids off the street" and how 
boxing can give kids the discipline to succeed. Then the coach 
Brian will reemerge, grinning. "I can train a kid," he'll say, so 
emphatically that you can't help but think his kids are in awfully-
good hands. 

Brian's three proteges are Willie Medina, 26, the gym's 
most experienced and respected fighter; Damon Harris, 18, a 
recent Wilbur Cross High School graduate who has been box-
ing for three months; and Pedro Carmona, 21, a young man 
who has begun to turn his life around with dreams of profes-
sional boxing. None of them looks particularly friendly right 
now. Willie and Damon are limbering up in the ring, which is 
really nothing more than a thin floor mat, ring posts, and 
rope-all patched together with duct-tape. Willie and Damon 
will box for two rounds, followed by Willie and Pedro, then 
Damon and Pedro. 

With three urgent blasts from a buzzer, Willie and Damon 
face each other, knees bem, gloves raised. Everyone else in the 
gym, ten or so men and boys working at punching bags, turn 
their attention to the ring. "Box!" Brian commands, and the 
fists start flying. Two sounds can be heard: the whoosh of 
exhaled breath and the thud of fists hitting bodies and fists hit-
ting heads. From the outset, Willie controls the action, land-
ing punches with tremendous power. "Willie, throw that hook 
in there," Brian directs from outside the ring. "OK," Willie 
responds coolly, deftly mixing the punch into his barrage. 

Damon, meanwhile, who's faster than Willie, tries to use his 
speed to his advantage. Damon's got the right game plan, but 
Willie is too strong and experienced. 

The buzzer ends the round. Damon looks relieved. By

Brian's buzzer, blaring insistently through the windows. Go up

smell of automobiles, you'll know you've arrived. 

Visiting Ring One for the 
first time early in the summer, 
before Damon and Pedro have 
ever set foot in the gym, I don't 
find any sparring going on. 
Brian walks over to me, and an 
incredibly enthusiastic, impas-

education to all his kids and 
how boxing can be an integral

sufficiency," he says. "You get

I'm standing there punchdrunk, overwhelmed by the flurry 
I of cliches. I feel as if I've heard it all before. Politicia[ls talking 
iB about keeping kids off.Jhe street. Big-time college football 
;it COaches talking about putting education first. Brian sounds sin-
cere, but in these first few moments I'm skeptical. The next 
time I hear the cliches, I won't be. I'll realize that Ring One is, 
in many ways, itself a cliche-the dingy, sweat-stained ring, the 
!I Young fighters clinging to their dreams, the charismatic coach 
rJ 
who can't stop talking. And then I'll realize that here, unlike 
any other place I've visited, the cliches are all real. 

What convinces me is a visit to the back corner of the gym, 
a tiny area set off with blue tarpaulins where Brian says he's got a 
scrapbook that he wants to show me. Inside these blue 
tarpaulins, along with the scrapbook and assorted other memo-
rabilia, is something I don't expect to see: a bed. This tiny cor-
ner of the gym is where Brian sleeps. 

"lfl the winter I can see my breath at night," he says. 

0 
pening Brian's scrapbook like opening a floodgate. 
Brian's stories pour out, one after another, at a relent-
less, exuberant pace. The stories revolve around a set 
cast of characters. None of them trains at Ring One anymore, 
but they remain presences in the gym. They are the ones whose 
names are written on fight posters or directly onto the walls 
under words like "State Champion." The older men in the 
gym, at the mention of their names, will nod and smile. Brian, 
a gifted yarn-spinner, can conjure them all up, re-creating the 
way they talked and the way they carried themselves in the ring. 

Many of Brian's stories center on Kareem Wali, 15 years old 
when he fought for Ring One. Even at that age, Brian says, 
Kareem showed more talent than any other fighter who has set 
foot in Ring One. Brian says he altered Kareem's birth certifi-
cate so that he could fight older boys when his peers no longer 
presented a challenge. "Kareem firmly believed that he was 
never going to lose," the coach says. 

Kareem's confidence disintegrated in one night, at the New 
England Golden Gloves in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Kareem 
was fighting in the finals against a local kid with an amazing left 
hook who everyone thought was unbeatable. On fight night, 
Kareem performed beautifully, dominating the local kid and 
even swaying the hometown crowd. Then, inexplicably, the 
judges gave the fight to the local kid. Kareem broke down. 
"There was a lot of shit going on in the ring, so I told my other 
fighters to take Reemy down to the locker room," Brian says. 
"When I got down there a few minutes later, he wasn't around. 
I found my kid crying in a bathroom stall." 

After the Golden Gloves it became an impossibility to keep 
Kareem focused on boxing. "He pulled out of eight fights in a 
row," Brian says. "I used to chase him all around New Haven."

''~u get two kinds of kids with boxing, 
scared kids and kids who think they're 
bad-asses. '' 

Brian has no 
illusions about 
professional box-
ing. It's a grimy 
The two quarreled, and, eventually, 
the coach threw Kareem out of the 
gym. He wasn't committed to being a 
fighter anymore. Kareem still calls 
Brian to say he wants to get back into 
the sport. The coach has al~wed 
Kareem back into the gym on several 
occasions. Each time, though, Kareem 
has failed to follow through. 

With lightning quickness, the 
subject turns to Reggie Higgins, 
Brian's closest approach to training a 
pro. "Reggie was the first fighter that I 
developed from scratch," Brian says. 
"He was my fighter. And if a kid's 
your fighter, then no matter where he 
goes he's still your fighter." Boxing 
coaches like to see their athletes as 
works of art which only they can com-
plete. Reggie was Brian's first creation. 

world, in which a handful of extraordi-
narily talented fighters get fame and 
fabulous wealth while the vast majori-
ty toil in obscurity and near poverty. 

Still, Brian dreams. "I thought for 
sure Reggie would go pro. But I want 
pros chat I developed. If a great fight-.. 
er walked in here tonight from another 
gym, I'd send him away." 

T
he scrapbook closes. Sitting 
inside the blue carps in a near-
empty gym on this early sum-
mer day, Brian is as far from training a 
professional fighter as he has ever 
been. 

Brian thinks that if he could move 
the gym into the Hili section of New 
Haven, he could have more fighters 
like Reggie and Kareem. It's easy to 
puc, relying on membership dues ($20 
per month for adults, $10 for kids; 
kids with a B-average or better in 
school train for free) and whatever he 
can scrape together from his day job at 
a health food store. 

Brian has probably thought harder 
about the mind set of inner-city kids 
than any ocher community activist or 
educator in New Haven. "It's a lesson 
in psychology up here every day," he 
says. The coach claims that he can tell 
exactly what a kid is chinking by the 
way he moves in the gym. Brian tells a 
story about one of his favorite little 
kids, a 14-year-old named Rolando, 
who he surmised was being beaten at 
home by the way he reacted to Brian's 
demonstration of punching technique. 
Every time Brian would move his fist 
in Rolando's direction, the kid would 
shrink, as if he were anticipating being 
hie. Rolando ended up staying at Ring 
One for several days, with Brian, until 

Almost as soon as Reggie sec foot 
in Ring One, he and Brian became 
inseparable. They trained together, 
hung out together, and celebrated vic-
tory after victory together. Brian 
recalls post-fight revelry almost as 
vividly as he recalls the fights them-
selves.

At 25, Reggie began to catch the 
eyes of professional boxing promoters. 
One by one, with practiced smiles and 
dazzling promises, they came, each 
with his own bit of advice for Brian's 
fighter. "I was losing the grip," Brian 
says. Increasingly, Reggie insisted on 
doing things his own way. 

It was not until Reggie did the 
unthinkable that Brian and Reggie's 
relationship fell apart: Reggie sparred 
at another gym. "You just don't do 
that," the coach explains. It's a betray-
al that still smarts, even after two 
years. "I would rather have my girl-
friend fucking someone else. There 
are plenty of other women out there, 
but how many great fighters?" Reggie 
never did go pro. After leaving Ring 
One, he was never the same fighter.

kids, live on the Hill. It's 
one of New Haven's most 
deprived neighborhoods, a 
place presumably full of 
young men who would be 
drawn to the "poor man's

tried to enlist the city's help 
to move the gym, but he's 
run into nothing but red 
tape. Politician's rhetoric, 
unlike Brian's, packs no 
punch. None of the politi-
cians goes home to a smelly,

his family situation calmed down. 

Brian's compassion for inner-city 
kids does not extend to white kids 
from suburbia. A white fighter can 
find a home in Ring One, but he is 
going to have to work extra hard to do 
so. "White guys are much less likely to 
hang around," he says. "They usually 
come for the wrong reasons. They 
want to be tough guys." 

Somehow, though, I don't find it 
incongruous when Brian tells me that 
he grew up in an upper-middle class 
home in Orange, a prosperous New 
Haven suburb. "I was a fuck-up in 
high school," he says. "If it weren't for 
boxing, I'd still be a fuck-up. It's easy 
for me." Brian was a classic suburban 
underachiever, a kid whose IQ tests 
indicated he should be at the top of his 
class, but who for whatever reason pre-
ferred the bottom. After graduation, 
Brian joined the Navy, where, as a 20-
year-old sailor, he learned how to box. 

In spite of Ring One's continually 
dire financial situation, in spite of its 
present dearth of good fighters, Brian 
exudes the calm optimism of someone 
who has survived times of true desper-
ation. "Everything changes," he says. 
"Two years ago I had Reggie and those 
guys. Last year, I had a bunch of little 
kids." Brian pauses. He seems almost . 
overwhelmed by the parade of faces 
that has passed through the gym. 

Then the parade stops. There's one 
name he's forgotten, one face whose 
presence at the gym he has, perhaps, 
taken for granted at times. "And 
Willie," he says. 
"I always have 
Willie." 

Willie Medina is 5' 10" and 
150 pounds. His body is 
taut, perfectly honed for 
giving and receiving blows. There are 
no unnecessary bulges. When Willie 
boxes, his eyes burst open and gaze 
furiously on his opponent. Willie's 
boxing technique, developed carefully 
over ten years of training, is as intimi-
dating as his appearance. It's so good, 
in fact, that 
when middle-
.class kids call 
Ring One ask-
ing for private 
lessons, Brian usually asks Willie to do 
the job. 

Talking to Willie is not nearly so 
intimidating 
as 
fighting 
him. 

Articulate and disarmingly earnest, 
Willie grew up with all the odds 
stacked against him. He has lived his 
entire life in public-housing projects in 
Stratford, watching his mother work 
multiple jobs to support the family 
and his brother struggle with drug 
addiction. He credits boxing with giv-
ing him the discipline to stay clean. 

Now Willie wants to become a police 
officer or a firefighter, and he is pursu-
ing these goals with determination. 

Willie works 9 to 5 delivering auto 
parts. At night he takes courses at 
Housatonic Community College, 
where he has almost completed a 
degree in Criminal Justice, and he vol-
unteers as an Emergency Medical 
Technician. Still, the job search has 
been frustrating. ''I'm taking so many 
tests, but nothing's working out," he 
says. "Just yesterday I cook one at a 
fire station in Cheshire. I figure if I'm 
persistent something's going to hap-
pen." 

At Ring One, Willie is a role 
model. He's constantly being called 
upon for advice and inspiration. 

Willie is the only person in the gym 
whom I ever saw interrupt Brian's 
coaching in order to interject his own 
bit,of expertise. "There's no human 
being that I know that works as hard 
as this kid," Brian says. "If I had a 
company I'd hire Willie in a minure." 

In the second round, Willie contin-
ues to frustrate and punish 
Damon. The younger, smaller, less 
experienced fighter is exhausted. At 
the sound of the buzzer, he stumbles 
out of the ring, downcast and exhaust-
ed. 

Brian tries to lift his spirits.

For many New Haven residents, John DeStefano's cam-
paign slogan reads like a cruel decree of fate. "It's 
Time," the letters proclaim in red, white, and blue. 
The phrase presumably reflects DeStefano's determination 
to reverse the trend of almost unmitigated deterioration · 
that has left New Haven in a shambles. For many residents 
of New Haven, however, the phrase simply means it is time 
to retire another ·unsuccessful administration that has suc-
cumbed to the sheer difficulty of governing a city whose 
needs vastly outnumber its resources. 

According to the Connecticut Department of Labor, 
unemployment in New Haven peaked at 7.3 percent in July 
of this year, up from an average of 6.6 percent for the whole 
of 1990. More layoffs loom as Sc:IU'thern . 
is unsure whether she will make it to the polls this year. 

Elections in New Haven have become something of a 
funereal affair. They claim little of the optimism and 
hope for 'regeneration that accompany elections in 
other parts of this country. Some would even say the current 
mayoral election symbolizes the elusiveness of real change. 
John DeStefano has no significant opposition, and yet he 
served as chief administrative officer for the DiLieto admin-
istration, whose corruption and trickle-down economics left 
New Haven with a $12-million debt in 1989. "These guys 
are like ghosts," says local businessman Michael Rosenthal. 
He added, with a fatalism that afflicts many New Haven 
voters, "That's basic big-city politics." 

New England Telephone, dealing with 
the competitive challenges of utility 
deregulation, has encouraged 3,600 
workers to retire or face the possibility 
of being fired. At a time when its resi-
dents can least afford it, the city's prop-
erty taxes have risen in a way that ren-
ders the term "sky-rocket" inadequate.

dus of its residents, with the population falling from 
164,443 in 1950 to 126,109 in 1980. The trend reversed 
itself slightly between 1980 and 1990. But, in the words of 
Board of Aldermen president Tomas Reyes, New Haven 
residents faced with a crumbling city may begin to ask 
themselves, "What am I doing here?" 

It appears that many have already begun to question 
whether anything can really be done to rejuvenate the city. 
Shawn Garris, assistant director of the Dixwell Community 
House, said the majority of New Haven residents, especially 
blacks and Latinos, feel apathetic "because of all the promis-
es on the part of past administrations that never came to 
fruition." Voter turnout surged to nearly 60 percent in the 
1989 election as twice as many black and Latino voters, gal-
vanized by the prospect of the city's first minority mayor, 
showed up at the polls. Turnout is now back to the 1987 
level of around 30 percent. It is especially low among 
blacks, discouraged by the failure of Mayor John Daniels-
once regarded as their best advocate--to redeem City Hall. 

Julia Ficklin, an Mrican-American New Haven resi-
dent, may have captured the fatalistic mood of this election 
when she said, ''I'm not pleased with DeStefano ... but it's a 
done deal. I can't do anything." Ficklin, who usually votes, 


terious poster: a square painted the fluo-
rescent orange of road signs urging caution with a bold-face 
question mark in the middle. These pessimistic placards 
stare dauntingly from the windows of the city's vacant 
buildings. DeStefano promises the second-coming of 
progress while people wonder if it is too late; if the "time" 
has passed. "It's going to be a disaster," said city resident Jim 
O 'Conner. "It doesn't matter who gets elected." 

The apparent "apathy" of New Haven's electorate actu-
ally reflects something much more serious. The whole polit-
ical process has stalled, as it fails to address people's concerns 
in a direct and meaningful way. 

he sped around New Haven in his snazzy, black 
Volkswagen, with kids in tow and the theme song to 
ocky piping out of the radio, Republican .candidate 
Kevin Skiest epitomized the angry citizen taking things into 
his own hands. Searching for fed-up people who could be 
inspired by the. same "insanity" that drove him to take on 
the system, Skiest found frustration coupled with resigna-
tion, people who were angry, but withdrawn. "You've gotta 
be be crazy to want to be mayor of New Haven," one man 
exclaimed when a Skiest volunteer waved a pamphlet at 
him. 


Observers like Skiest volunteer Frank Ragozinno some-
times reduce New Haven politics to the dry observation: 
"It's going to take us years to wake these people up." Yet 
t~e~e are those who are wide awake, just paralyzed with pes-
simism. 

"By the time you get this far, you've sold your soul to 
the devil," said Fair Haven resident Susan Sapp of the 
repeated election of Democrat administrations. But when 
Skiest asked her to join him in a fight for change, she just 
averted her eyes and grinned. "Why did you run as a 
Republican?" she asked Slciest. "It's the kiss of death." 

The DeStefano campaign itself seems to have largely 
taken place in a vacuum. It somehow remains absurdly iso-
lated from those most concerned with the issue of change. 
''I'm not going to vote unless DeStefano says something," 
said a New Haven resident who gave his name as K.C. "It's 
a wait-and-see kind of thing." 

As the Dixwell Q House's Garris observed, politics take 
on an almost surreal aspect in the city's ghettos. People con-
tinually hear about social programs designed to improve life 
in the inner city and yet, says Garris, their neighborhoods 
remain unchanged. 

Skiest points to lack of political dialogue and debate as 
the reason City Hall appears to serve so few of the city's res-
idents. "How can we expect to have accountable govern-
ment when we don't even have an accountable preelection 
format?" Slciest asked, frustrated when DeStefano declined 
to debate him publicly. 

The very separation of people from politics that 
doomed the Daniels' administration may help to usher 
D eStefano into office, Representative Bill Dyson (D-94) 
observed ironically. "If there is any indication of what to 
expect, part of the reason the past administration got voted 
out was for falling out of touch: a few people being able to 
extract whatever they wanted from the system, the rest be 
damned." 

Mournfulness permeates the unnatural calm surround-
ing the current mayoral race. "On the whole I'm pes-
simistic. I think this race symbolizes the deterioration of 
New Haven politics," said Paul Bass, political commentator 
for the New Haven Advocate. 

Can city government still actively engage the city and 
its problems? The answer to this question may lie in 
the person of DeStefano himself 

DeStefano readily acknowledges, "New Haven does nor 
have a lot of time left." He points to a lack of "political con-
sensus" as the city's chief obstacle, and one that can be over-
come. But the question of just what kind of political con-
sensus he will establish remains troubling for many. 

From the election ofRichard Lee in 1953 until the later 
years of the DiLieto administration in the 80s, the 


New Haven awaits political and economic revival. 
Democratic Party enjoyed the reputation of what Alderman l 
" 
Reyes calls "a monolithic power house." Consensus within ~ 
the party was not a problem. Furthermore, prior to the late ~ 
80s, this party consensus seemed to reflect the electorate's ~ 
priorities. Arthur Barbieri (BK '38), Democratic party c: 
chairman since 1953, recalls handily winning elections in ~ 
which there was "70, 80 and 90 percent turn out." 

When an acute fiscal crisis developed in the late 80s, £ 
however, the party's leadership came under fire. In the years _s 
leading up to Daniels' election, the party's ego was severely 5 
deflated, and party organization began to degenerate. 

Many regarded the Daniels campaign as a much needed 
challenge to the political status quo in New Haven. John 
DeStefano, not Daniels, received the endorsement of the 
Democratic party prior to the 1989 Democratic primary. 
"Daniels took the party on," Dyson said. 

He could do this not only because of the widespread 
disenchantment with the DiLieto regime and the increased 
organization of black voters in the wake of Jessie Jackson's 
presidential campaign, but because o~ the extraordinary 
coalition he built. "The Daniels coalition was a rare phe-
nomenon in American politics: a progressive coalition, led 
by blacks and supported by liberal whites and elements of 
the business community," wrote Yale political scientists 
Mary Summers and Philip Klinkers in a 1991 article about 
Daniels' election to office. 

Although most New Haven residents agree that this 
campaign coalition did not meet its full potencial as a gov-
erning coalition, they disagree as to how complete this fail-
ure was, and what caused it. Yale political science professor 
Douglas Rae, who served briefly as Daniels' chief adminis-
trative officer, now calls the Daniels administration "dead

city's buildings not paying real estate 
taxes," said local real estate developer 
Joel Schiavone (BR '58), bemoaning 
Mayor Daniels' decision to build more 
low-income housing as a "disaster." 
"You can't operate like a liberal demo-
crat in the 90s. A successful mayor will 
have co be more centrist," Schiavone 
said, adding that he saw DeStefano 
heading in this direction. 

DeStefano's creative proposals 
suggest he has grappled with the issues 
and sees the need for change. He has 
disassociated himself from the trickle-
down economics that spurred many a .

Haven. Instead, seemingly aware of 
what Rae called the "overwhelming 
evidence that New Haven will not be a 
retail center for the region," DeStefano 
has opposed the building of the 
Taubman Mall. In calling for an 
increased emphasis on strengthening 
the city's existing institutions, such as 
biomedical technology, DeStefano has 
injected some much-needed pragma-
tism into the politics of a city given to 
pursuing unrealistic cure-ails. 

Furthermore, DeStefano has given 
an indication he will place sound judg-
ment before politics. A Catholic, 
DeStefano has supported the distribu-
tion of condoms at middle schools-
~ an idea that is unpopular in the 
!i Catholic community, whose support 
t he may need to stay in office. 

DeStefano's approach co the prob-
~ lem of exorbitant and inequitable 
1i property taxes aims at long-term 
~reform rather than a quick-fix solu-
~ cion. He proposes filing suit against 
~ the Connecticut legislature ro make 
~ suburbanites share the burden of taxa-
e tion for city services-services they 
f 
now use largely at rhe expense of New 
Haven's taxpayers. "The objective is 
not a successful lawsuit so much as to 
enhance the urgency of discussion of 
the issue," DeStefano said. 

DeStefano's campaign seems par-
ticulary bold and even progressive for 
having emerged in the midst of a polit-
ical freeze. No popular movement 
pressures him to reform. Yet, as 
Summers said, "DeStefano's campaign 
makes me feel as if the whole nature of 
political debate in New Haven has 
changed." 

But while city politics may con-
tinue to evolve, one still cannot 
shake the feeling that those at 
the helm ofNew Haven's political pro-
cess today are there by default. 
Widespread sentiment that city gov-
ernment is destined to fail prevents 
many would-be mayors from mount-
ing a serious opposition. 

The mayoral sear is "a job char 
nobody wants," according to Bass. 
"Any other strong candidate would 
have had DeStefano in a mental hospi-
tal within a week, because he can't take 
criticism," Bass said. 

Another reason people have diffi-
culty taking the mayoral race seriously 
may be that they take place in such 
rapid-fire succession, with elections 
every two years. Voters simply can't 
distinguish one race from another. 

The Democrats, who have opposed 
increasing term length to four years, 
are sometimes seen as exploiting this 
obstacle to a fully organized opposi-
tion. "Over the past 40 years 
Board of Education there are 9,000 
city jobs. All of these people have a few 
relatives in New Haven," he said. 
"That's 30,000 votes. These are people 
who vote their jobs and not the 
. 
" 
1ssues. 

Of course, political debate takes 
place between 
factions of the 
Democratic party itself. Reflecting on 
the primary, Reyes said, "We put 
cogether a straightforward discussion 
of issues because of which DeStefano 
is much aware of the issues of the 
inner-city." 

But in New Haven, where past 
administrations seem to have fallen 
our of touch, few would deny the need 
for greater communication between 
City Hall and the community. 

"Accountability" is a buzz word. 
Reyes himself has launched a "cam-
paign for the betterment of New 
Haven" which aims, among other 
things, co "provide a bridge between 
the administration and the communi-
ty." 

Ultimately, one cold fact under-
lies all the political rhetoric. As loudly 
as people proclaim "It's time" for 
accountable government, and "It's 
time" for lower taxes, and "It's time" 
for more jobs, the economy sleeps 
soundly on. The fate of New Haven's 
next mayor lies more on the good will 
of Washington, D.C., and Hartford 
than in New Haven itself.

**Title: Black Hole Sleuths**
**Author: Cheryl M Harris**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

T
he Big Bang was only the beginning. The universe is 
perpetually destroying and continually creating itself. 
Swirling clouds of dust become planets, exploding 
stars collapse into black holes. Within dying stars, the fusicm 
of hydrogen and helium takes place, involving intense ener-
gy, heat, and pressure. For years, scientjsts, seeking to under-
'S stand the intricate mechanisms behind the universe's contin-
~ ual self-creation and self-destruction, attempted to determine 
'l the rate at which helium burns inside a massive star's core . 

This .rate indicates the ratio of carbon to oxygen formed 
~ within the core's nuclear fusion reactions. Since 
1 this simple ratio can reveal the eventual fate 
] of massive stars, the race to ~lculate its 
~ value became one of the preeminent 
§ quests of modern astrophysics. 

The rate of helium burning 
~ has finally been measured. In 
; April, rwo independent research 
.£ teams, one at Yale, led by Moshe 
~ Gai, associate professor o 
t physics; and the other at Tri-
University Meson Facility (TRI-
UMF) in Canada, discovered 
within their laboratories what once 
could only be reproduced on com-
puter simulations. Gai and a handful 
Yale students achieved the same end as 
TRIUMF did with a $50-million research bud-
get and the collaboration of three universities. The Yale 
and TRIUMF experiments found out what Gai calls the 
"number one unknown in nuclear astrophysics." 

Yale and TRIUMF submitted their fmal research papers 
a week apart. Alhough the rwo teams discovered the rate of 
helium burning through different methods, they reached 
remarkably similar results and confirmed prior computer 
predictions. 

As a result of the success of Gai's team and TRIUMF, 
scientists now know that approximately 85 percent of carbon 
atoms formed within massive stars fuse with helium and 
become oxygen. Knowing that more stars produce a great 
deal of oxygen has increased the chances that a greater num-
ber of massive stars will "skip" subsequent reactions and 
become supernovas. In addition, the calculated value of the 
carbon-oxygen ratio can help scientists predict how dense the 
core of a supernova will be, and if that supernova will col-
lapse into a black hole. 

At Yale, Gai led a team composed of Zhiping Zhao 
(GRD '93), Ralph H. France III (GRD '94), Kin Seng Lai 
(GRD '97), Steve L. Rugari (GRD '90), Edward 1:.. Wilds 
from the University of Connecticut, and a number of under-
graduates from Yale and other universities. Zhao, now at the 
University of Washington in Seattle, chose the problem of 
determining the rate of helium burning as her Ph.D. thesis 
topic under Gai's supervision. 

After intensive observations and calculations, scientists 
knew that a star roughly 25 times more massive than the sun 
lasts about 7.5 million years before it becomes an 
exploding star, a supernova. Scientists consider a 
star "massive" when its mass exceeds six times 
the mass of the sun. These stars expend 
huge amounts of energy .in the hydrogen 
'and helium fusion reactions within their 
cores. The cores violently contract, 
increasing the pressure and temperature 
within the cores. This tumultuous 
compression of the core leads to the 
massive star's devolution into a red 
giant. At the same time, the star's outer 
shell expands, while reactions within the 
core continue to expend energy furiously. 

During the first 7 million of these final 
years, the star produces helium from the 
fusion of hydrogen nuclei. In the last 500,000 
years, when this reaction of hydrogen nuclei has been 
nearly exhausted, helium fusion predominates. Inside the. 
star's core, fusion reactions involving three alpha particles 
(helium nuclei) bring about the formation of carbon-12. A 
nucleus of carbon-12 can then capture another alpha particle 
to make oxygen-16. 

The carbon/oxygen core continues to release tremen-
dous amounts of energy. Temperatures within the star reach-
levels beyond measurements of nuclear physics. As the core 
contracts, iron is produced inside the core. The dying star's 
extremely dense center finally collapses into a neutron star, a 
remnant of the core, or collapses further into a black hole. 
This stellar corpse creates tremendous gravity, sucking matter 
and light into its fathomless black chasm. 

he ratio of carbon-12 to oxygen-16 indicates more 
than just the characteristics of a star's core. This ratio 
allows astrophysicists to estimate three things: how 
quickly heavy elements--such as silicon, neon, and sulfur-
form within the star, in what order these elements form, and 
from indirect measurement, the timing and eventual fate of 
the star's explosion as a supernova. If the helium-burning 
reaction ·within a particular massive star produces small 
amounts of oxygen, heavy elements will ~e formed before the 
star reaches the supernova stage. If, however, the helium-
burning reaction produces significantly more oxygen, reac-
tions forming the heavy elements are "skipped" and the stars 
become supernovas much faster than expected. For scientists 
observing a star at the supernova stage, the carbon-oxygen 
ratio can be a factor in determining whether or not this star's 
core will become dense enough to. collapse into a black hole. 

The combined rate of these two linked reactions 
involved in helium burning determines the overall ratio of 
carbon-12 to oxygen-16 within the core of a massive star. 
Scientists had already discovered the first reaction rate but 
the rate of the second reaction, involving the transformation 
of carbon-12 into oxygen-16, had yet to be calculated. 

Physicist Steve Koonin and colleagues at the California 
Institute of Technology and independent researchers in 
Belgium in 1985 predicted that the second reaction rate of 
helium burning could be measured in the laboratory. 

Researchers, however, found it difficult to duplicate the 
nuclear fusion reaction processes inside a star's extremely 
high temperature core within the mundane conditions of the 
laboratory. The teams at Yale and TRIUMF saw an alterna-
tive method for measuring the second reaction rate. 

They decided to run the entire helium-burning reaction 
backwards. "The laws of physics are completely invariant 
under the transformation of time," says Gai. By reversing 
the reaction, the two teams calculated the reaction rate and 
determined the ratio of carbon-12 to oxygen-16 more easily. 

Professor Gai calls reversing the helium-burning reaction 
"just a clever trick to allow us to measure small quantities." 

Gai's research team fired a beam of deuterium {an iso-
tope of hydrogen) at a thin sheet of titanium doped with 
nitrogen. The deuterium beam's impact on the thin sheet of 
titanium and nitrogen created an isotope of nitrogen, nitro-
gen-16. Since nitrogen-16 is very unstable, the isotope 
immediately decays into oxygen-16. Oxygen-16 further 
decays into carbon-12 and helium. This process i~ simply the 
reverse of the second helium-burning reaction, officially 
known in its experimental reaction formula 12c(a , y) 16o, 
where a and y signifY. garcicle recapture by carbon-12 ( 12c) 
to create oxygen-16 ( 1 0). 

The team filled dozens of laboratory booklets with long, 
consistent calculations of the experiment. "We spent about 
13 weeks actually getting data for this experiment, and those 
13 weeks ran 24 hours a day for about five and half days dur-
ing the week," says France, one of the Yale graduate students 
working on the project. After nearly five years of work, Gai's 
team finally measured the reverse reaction and could calcu-
late, 
using 
quantum 
mechanics, how 
many times the 
forward reac-
tion can happen 
inside the star's 
core. By obtain-
ing this reaction 
rate, the Yale 
team 
could 
compute 
the 
proportion of 
carbon-12 and 
oxygen-16 
formed in the 
final stages of 
nuclear fusion Physics professor Mosh~ Gai and studmt 
before a star Ralph K France measured the rate of helium 
explodes. 

Around the same time, TRIUMF, a huge venture spe-
cializing in nuclear and particle physics founded in 1968 by 
the universities of Alberta, British Columbia, and Victoria, 
and Simon Fraser University, used a different technique 
based on the same principle of the reverse reaction to discov-
er the second reaction rate. Researchers first produced a 
beam of nitrogen-16 and then fired this beam into a target 
composed of carbon-12. Special detectors gauged similarities 
between the emission of alpha particles and the emission of 
carbon nuclei from the disintegration of oxygen-16 nuclei 
created within that target. 

In the July 1993 issue of Discover, Gai comments, "Now 
we have only four, perhaps five, very good candidates for 
black holes. We know, based on our results, that we should 
see many more." The information gained from these experi-
ments can also help scientists explain what will be inevitable 
within our own solar system. "Our sun, for about 4.6 billion 
years, has been fusing hydrogen into helium," adds Gai. "In 
another 5 billion years it will expand into a red giant. The 
radius of the sun will then include the earth, with tempera-
tures around 6,000° C." 

Both research teams are still trying to lower the system-
atic error in their experiments, which would make their 
results more reliable. Nevertheless, their results remain an 
elegant description of the death of stars and the birth of 
black holes. Yale and TRIUMF's measurement of the heli-
um-burning reaction rate has brought science closer to 
understanding the processes behind the continuous creation 
and destruction of the universe.

They used to go to Superfresh on I Oth Street. My mom still 
goes to Superfresh, but my dad goes down to the Pathmark 
at the airport," she explains. She's not sure why he does that; 
he says Pachmark is bigger, but "he always buys the same

her father's house. So her 16-year-old brother often stops off 
at Mom's to eat after school, even when it's Dad's custodial 
time. Beth's parents got joint custody of the kids and the 
cleaning lady, but her mom got the supermarket. 

While her brother lets his stomach lead him home, 
Beth has a harder time deciding where to go for vacations.

always felt that they made a healthy and supportive 
amity, she tells me, curled on her ratty common

of self until she got to college. But during her first year 
at Yale, she was shaken by her sister's questions about 
how healthy their family really was. She opens a 
pink flowered diary, and reads me the entry she 
made freshman year when her sister 
announced that she wasn't coming home 
anymore. 

"I am afraid, because I can feel that 
our family is going to fall apart over 
the years and I don't think there is 
anything I can do about it. I'm 
scared. It's hard to just stand

As she reads, Alisa chuckles at the high drama of her

She still worries about Christmas, and not spending it with her sister, without whom she once felt she could not keep her family a family. But now she questions whether her family has really crumbled in the last three years or whether she has just realized that they weren't so solid to begin with.


Her mother's leg pain started the weekend Jenny's parents brought her to school freshman year. "By the time I was a junior there was a disabled sticker on the car," she says, describing her mother's pain, her inability to walk, the surgery she's had, and the surgery she still needs in order to recover fully. In the midst of the lengthy catalogue of ailments and symptoms, she begins to laugh, a little ruefully. What else can she do? How else can you handle a parent's debilitating illness when you're hundreds of miles away?


The family has changed since she went away and her mother got sick. "My sister just doesn't come home anymore," she says, shrugging and pacing around her common room, picking lint off the carpet, straightening things that don't need to be straightened. Her parents are unable to keep her 17-year-old sister home at night. They don't know where she goes, and Jenny doesn't think they want to. Jenny has a pretty good idea and is very worried. But she's too far away to help, or even to be involved.


When Jenny lived at home, "there were rules. There were a lot of rules. We had curfews, we weren't allowed to drive the car at night-I don't know, what rules do you have? We weren't allowed to do things," she says, now slouching on a saggy couch, face down turned.


Jenny knows that her being at home would not make her mother better. She feels guilty at being away only because when she's home, some of the old rules come back into play. Her sister stays in line more when she's at home. When Jenny's home, she knows where her sister's going, what's up.


But slouched on her couch tonight, she's not feeling that she can make a difference at home. Her sister has been difficult since infancy. And her mother's illness is "a definite medical thing. It isn't a direct result of my coming to college," she says. But she hesitates. "Is it?"

her family's problems. "Sometimes I 
think that it does, and sometimes I 
don't," she says. Like Alisa and Beth, 
Jenny has decided that things may not 
have actually changed so much. The 
problems, or their seeds, were always 
there, and it is only since leaving home 
that she can see them. "I think I just 
never noticed things before. I thought 
1 we had a great family." 


But no matter when and why the 
fissures began, Jenny has decided that 
for her own sanity, she cannot be over-
l involved. "You can't fix things for 
.!, somebody," she says. ''A lot of dealing 
~ with your fam ily is learning what is 
and what is not in your control." 


((D istance," 
we 
agree. 
"D istance." We are learn-
ing the rules of distance 
and space, working ourselves into 
independence. It makes us slightly 
more grown-up. We cry to each other 
rather than our parents. I call home 
less often. A couple of us, myself 
included, contemplate actually sup-
porting ourselves next year. 


This part, the independence and 
the adulthood that develop when your 
childhood family changes is good, we 
agree. This is growth, development, 
character building. 


But I keep my photograph. It's 
better than the memory and easier 
than the reality. Glossy color photos 
full of smiles invariably improve upon 
the memories, air-brushing away the 
adolescent storms, the adult angst. 
The photograph sits on my dresser, a 
family, all dressed up and happy at 
high school graduation, graduate bear-
ing diploma, smiling, confident, and 
innocent.
