her family's problems. "Sometimes I 
think that it does, and sometimes I 
don't," she says. Like Alisa and Beth, 
Jenny has decided that things may not 
have actually changed so much. The 
problems, or their seeds, were always 
there, and it is only since leaving home 
that she can see them. "I think I just 
never noticed things before. I thought 
1 we had a great family." 


But no matter when and why the 
fissures began, Jenny has decided that 
for her own sanity, she cannot be over-
l involved. "You can't fix things for 
.!, somebody," she says. ''A lot of dealing 
~ with your fam ily is learning what is 
and what is not in your control." 


((D istance," 
we 
agree. 
"D istance." We are learn-
ing the rules of distance 
and space, working ourselves into 
independence. It makes us slightly 
more grown-up. We cry to each other 
rather than our parents. I call home 
less often. A couple of us, myself 
included, contemplate actually sup-
porting ourselves next year. 


This part, the independence and 
the adulthood that develop when your 
childhood family changes is good, we 
agree. This is growth, development, 
character building. 


But I keep my photograph. It's 
better than the memory and easier 
than the reality. Glossy color photos 
full of smiles invariably improve upon 
the memories, air-brushing away the 
adolescent storms, the adult angst. 
The photograph sits on my dresser, a 
family, all dressed up and happy at 
high school graduation, graduate bear-
ing diploma, smiling, confident, and 
innocent.
