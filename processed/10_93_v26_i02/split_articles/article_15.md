his family situation calmed down. 

Brian's compassion for inner-city 
kids does not extend to white kids 
from suburbia. A white fighter can 
find a home in Ring One, but he is 
going to have to work extra hard to do 
so. "White guys are much less likely to 
hang around," he says. "They usually 
come for the wrong reasons. They 
want to be tough guys." 

Somehow, though, I don't find it 
incongruous when Brian tells me that 
he grew up in an upper-middle class 
home in Orange, a prosperous New 
Haven suburb. "I was a fuck-up in 
high school," he says. "If it weren't for 
boxing, I'd still be a fuck-up. It's easy 
for me." Brian was a classic suburban 
underachiever, a kid whose IQ tests 
indicated he should be at the top of his 
class, but who for whatever reason pre-
ferred the bottom. After graduation, 
Brian joined the Navy, where, as a 20-
year-old sailor, he learned how to box. 

In spite of Ring One's continually 
dire financial situation, in spite of its 
present dearth of good fighters, Brian 
exudes the calm optimism of someone 
who has survived times of true desper-
ation. "Everything changes," he says. 
"Two years ago I had Reggie and those 
guys. Last year, I had a bunch of little 
kids." Brian pauses. He seems almost . 
overwhelmed by the parade of faces 
that has passed through the gym. 

Then the parade stops. There's one 
name he's forgotten, one face whose 
presence at the gym he has, perhaps, 
taken for granted at times. "And 
Willie," he says. 
"I always have 
Willie." 

Willie Medina is 5' 10" and 
150 pounds. His body is 
taut, perfectly honed for 
giving and receiving blows. There are 
no unnecessary bulges. When Willie 
boxes, his eyes burst open and gaze 
furiously on his opponent. Willie's 
boxing technique, developed carefully 
over ten years of training, is as intimi-
dating as his appearance. It's so good, 
in fact, that 
when middle-
.class kids call 
Ring One ask-
ing for private 
lessons, Brian usually asks Willie to do 
the job. 

Talking to Willie is not nearly so 
intimidating 
as 
fighting 
him. 

Articulate and disarmingly earnest, 
Willie grew up with all the odds 
stacked against him. He has lived his 
entire life in public-housing projects in 
Stratford, watching his mother work 
multiple jobs to support the family 
and his brother struggle with drug 
addiction. He credits boxing with giv-
ing him the discipline to stay clean. 

Now Willie wants to become a police 
officer or a firefighter, and he is pursu-
ing these goals with determination. 

Willie works 9 to 5 delivering auto 
parts. At night he takes courses at 
Housatonic Community College, 
where he has almost completed a 
degree in Criminal Justice, and he vol-
unteers as an Emergency Medical 
Technician. Still, the job search has 
been frustrating. ''I'm taking so many 
tests, but nothing's working out," he 
says. "Just yesterday I cook one at a 
fire station in Cheshire. I figure if I'm 
persistent something's going to hap-
pen." 

At Ring One, Willie is a role 
model. He's constantly being called 
upon for advice and inspiration. 

Willie is the only person in the gym 
whom I ever saw interrupt Brian's 
coaching in order to interject his own 
bit,of expertise. "There's no human 
being that I know that works as hard 
as this kid," Brian says. "If I had a 
company I'd hire Willie in a minure." 

In the second round, Willie contin-
ues to frustrate and punish 
Damon. The younger, smaller, less 
experienced fighter is exhausted. At 
the sound of the buzzer, he stumbles 
out of the ring, downcast and exhaust-
ed. 

Brian tries to lift his spirits.
