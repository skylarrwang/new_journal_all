The Women's Table joins Yale s collection of public art.

n October 1, hundreds of students, faculty, and 
alumni gathered to celebrate the dedication of what 
Yale President Richard Levin (GRD '74) called "a 
beautiful vision and remarkable artistic achievement." 
The Women's Table, a sculpture by Maya Y. Lin (SY '81, ARC 
'86) celebrating the contributions of women at Yale, was 
unveiled in front of Sterling Memorial Library. President 
Levin, former President Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. (TC '63, 
LAW '66), and Provost Judith Rodin (GRD '79) spoke, and 
Whim'n Rhythm sang at the ceremony. With such fanfare 
surrounding its installation, and the disruptions caused by 
its construction, the sculpture has caught the attention of 
the entire Yale campus. 

The Womens Table, a 32-ton granite sculpture and 
fountain, celebrates the role of women at Yale. Digits 
engraved in the circular granite surface catalogue the num-
ber of women matriculating at Yale each year since the 
school's founding. The dates begin in 1701 and stop at 
1993; future numbers will not be added. In a few years, or 
even a few months, when the fanfare and the hype die 
down, when the name of the artist and the tide of her work 
are forgotten, when its meaning is no longer publicly exalt-
ed, what will become of this multi-million dollar project? 
Rodin, addressing the issue of the possible treatment of the 
sculpture said, "I think people will recognize the meaning of 
this, the welcoming and inclusive nature of the sculpture 
and walkways. I hope people will treat it kindly and rever-
entially." 

If the treatment of many past acquisitions is any indica-
ro THE NÂ£w JouRNAL 
tion of the fate of Maya Lin's work, the piece will need more 
than just Rodin's hopes and assurances. Before the Lin 
sculpture was unveiled, there were rumors of plans for beer 
slides atop the installation, and one student predicted The 
Womens Table would become a "big student birdbath." 

Such treatment would follow consistently Yale's tradition of 
disrespect and apathy towards its public art. 

Claes Oldenburg (SM '50) intended his sculpture, 
Lipstick on Caterpillar Tracks, to draw controversy. One of 
the more prominent works on campus, it has garnered the 
attention of students since its installation in 1969. The 
occasion drew a crowd of over a thousand onto Beinecke 
Plaza. Oldenburg and a group of students who had helped 
commission the sculpture hoped the piece would act as a 
rallying point and gathering place. The artist originally 
intended the lipstick to be inflatable so that students could 
raise it during important events or to announce a speech. 
Although the original vision did not succeed (structural 
problems demanded that the vinyl and wood be replaced by 
steel, aluminum, and fiberglass), students found many uses 
for the giant landmark. In the turbulent years of the late 60s 
and early 70s, the lipstick served as a podium and kiosk for 
radical groups like Students for a Democratic Society. Zero 
Population Growth sheathed the lipstick with a huge plastic 
bag, and opponents of the piece reportedly tried to pour lye 
on it to quicken its deterioration. Since the lipstick's reloca-
tion to Morse College, students have found less radical uses 
for the sculpture; it has become more a joke and catalyst for 
pranks than anything else. Nevertheless, history of art pro-
fessor Vincent Scully OE '40) interprets the postering and 
graffiti on the Oldenburg sculpture as congruous with the 
original purpose. He exalts the sculpture as "a functioning 
work of art." Citing the Oldenburg sculpture as an example 
of a work intended to incite reaction, he explains. "Art is 
always for a response. The lipstick extracts a reaction; myths 
are built around it." The Women's Table differs in style and 
intent and, therefore, according to Scully, will differ in its 
role on campus. "The lipstick is very approachable. The 
Maya Lin piece is a different style, a different type of work 
altogether." 

The fate and condition of these and other works of 
public art on campus relies on the judgment of students and 
administrators. "The way public art is kept up is a reflection 
of the way people feel about it," says Scully. "If they like it 
they will respect it; if they hate it they'll trash it."

This sentiment does not account for apathy towards the 
works, which is probably more common than real emotion 
either way. The kind of treatment most sculptures receive is 
not motivated by politics or an attempt to make a statement 
about the nature of the artwork itself. Rather, sculpture at 
Yale often goes unnoticed, ignored, or at most used for pri-
vate intentions and pranks. 

Susan Frankenbach, registrar of the Yale University Art 
Gallery, commented that public sculpture is for use by the 
community "as long as the integrity of the object is upheld." 
Some recent acts have overstepped this boundary. About 
three years ago, a group of students wrapped a sheet around 
the head of a Henry Moore bronze statue in the gallery's 
sculpture garden and then set it on fire. Last spring, stu-
dents climbed plowed piles of snow on Beinecke Plaza to 
reach the blades of Alexander Calder's stabile Gallows and 
Lollipops and used masking tape to form the initials of their

reflection of the way people feel about 
it. If they like it they will respect it; if 
they hate they'll trash it. " 
singing group. While these may seem like minor and harm-
less pranks, such acts may permanently damage already 
fragile works of art. 

Mark Aronson, an an conservator at the gallery who 
removed the masking tape from the Calder stable, explained 
that removing the tape removed some of the pigment as 
well. Outlines of the initials remained, especially where blue 
pigment was used. It is not a simple matter to repair or 
paint over the damage. Certain ethics come into play when 
restoring damaged works. Since original brushstrokes can-
not be replicated and the exact pigment cannot be matched, 
the conservator must weigh the value of preserving as much 
of the original work as possible versus ensuring its longevity. 
The Calder has not yet been repaired; officials are investi-
gating the cost of repair and trying to decide whether or not 
to replace the original matte sheen of the stabile with a 
more durable gloss finish. While these issues may not seem 
vital to the everyday workings of the university, they do 
involve a financial, as well as aesthetic, accounting; vandal-
ism greatly diminishes the work's value. As Frankenbach 
said, a damaged work is "only a shadow of its former self." 

The Calder stabile, installed in 1960, was already in 
delicate condition before last year's incident. Aronson said, 
"The damage placed further stress on an already fragile 
0crOBER 15, 1993 
piece." He explained that the university was looking into 
repairs not simply to flX the damage from the masking tape, 
but also to remedy long-term deterioration of the piece that 
the investigation uncovered, deterioration caused by envi-
ronmental conditions and normal wear and tear. 

Any outdoor sculpture is destined to be worn and 
weathered and will need repairs on a regular basis. Yet Yale 
makes no provision for periodic maintenance checks on the 
condition of the outdoor collection; subtle damage often 
goes unseen. Frankenbach says the art gallery must "rely on 
other people to be our eyes"-that is, Yale assumes others 
will report any damage. Aronson acknowledges that the 
sculptures should be washed once or rwice a year and the 
bronzes should be waxed annually; the gallery, however, 
lacks the staff and funds to regularly maintain the collec-
tion. 

I 
ncidents such as the damage to the Calder stabile clearly 
indicate that art around campus does not always receive 
the respectful treatment it would command if it were 
not located in a gallery. Gallery security supervisor Lynn 
Fitzgerald commented that outright malice has not caused 
damage to any of the works recently, but rather the careless-
ness of"students who weren't thinking." 

While the art gallery and university administrators have 
legitimate complaints when they bemoan the lack of con-
cern for art on campus, they seem co take a passive role in 
the outdoor sculptures' welfare. There are no labels or plac-
ards on the sculptures to help students identify the artists or 
interpret the work. While the university seems to have 
made an effort to bring the works of great artists to campus,
