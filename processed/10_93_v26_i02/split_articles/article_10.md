tudents under age 21 don't get turned away at the 
door. They enter the dimly lit, noisy 'room and imme-
diately push their way to the bar. Arms outstretched, 
they wait for the tap of Milwaukee's Best to slosh into their 
plastic cups. Foaming beer in hand, they survey the scene. 
Spotting some familiar faces, they jostle their way back into 
the crowd and yell to their friends over the deafening strains 
of the Dead. All the while they scan for that cute someone 
who smiled at them two days ago in history section, and 
who just might be out tonight. 

It's not Demery's, Naples, or Sigma Nu. It's the Beach 
Club, a large suite in Silliman, hosting one of its five-keg 
parties. And the Beach Club is just one of a host of rooms 
well known around campus for their catchy names and their 
seminal role in the Yale social scene. On nights when these 
rooms throw parties, hundreds of students pack into their 
spacious common rooms, then overflow into the entryway 
and the courtyard. 

Last year, the Beach Club residents threw about 16 par-
ties. Four hundred students came to the largest one, which 
featured a live band and six and a half kegs. But only about 
lived in the Beach Club last year too, said he spent about 
$200 on alcohol for parties. Still, he said the worst part of 
living in the Beach Club is cleaning the bathroom after par-
ties. "I also don't like the smell of beer that hangs around for 
a few days," he added. 

Before the air has time to clear, friends ask when the 
next party is. Call it the price of living in a room with a ~ 
doorbell (the Beach Club), a kitchen (the Bat Cave in ~ 
Silliman) or in a suite with two floors (Book World in ~ 
Calhoun and the Cottage). It is not just a tradition for ~ 
occupants of these rooms to throw parties. It is a social obli- -., 
gation. "You have something to live up to," Derek ~ 
Hausladen (DC '94) said. But the obligation has its ~ 
rewards. "The easiest way to meet people is to stand by a ·5 
keg and pour beer," Hausladen said. "Soon everybody ~ 
knows your name." 

T
he first Monday of each new semester is "Tequila ~ 
Monday" at the Beach Club and the Bat Cave. The .g

Club parties. "It's so hard to get 
a beer here," because of the 
number of people, said resident 
Matt Bierbaum (SM '95). 
Instead, "most people get ham-
mered beforehand and come 
here after to hang out." 
Residents of these rooms 
have to be willing to stack their 
furniture in a corner, discard 
their privacy, and open their 
suite to whomever shows up, 
even the student who came to a ---::::..oo-
Davenport Cottage party earlier 
this year wearing an inflatable 
moose around his waist. And 
Kate Battle (SY '95), a former 
resident of the Saybrook Beach, 
said she and her roommates had 
to kick people out of their bed-
rooms during parties in their 
eight-person suite.

Buying beer all the time The smell of stale beer permeates the entire environment. Do we have to have another party? 
also adds up. Bierbaum, who 
those who do not know what they are 
in for. A Silliman freshman walked 
past the kegs in the entryway of the 
Beach Club around 9 p.m. on Tequila 
Monday of this year, and asked if he 
was in the right place for the blue 
book party. Bierbaum and his room-
mates told the student, "Yes, but it 
doesn't start for an hour." When he 
carne back an hour later, blue book in 
hand, he found the kegs tapped and 
the tequila flowing. 

Last year, Beach Club residents 
added a new twist to an old tradition. 
They ended one of their parties with a

of a bat and baseball but is not usually 
played in the nude. Actually, Bierbaum 
admitted that the players on the team 
at bat were the only ones completely 
naked. "You could wear your boxers 
when you were fielding," he explained. 

The chance to live in a suite with 
a triple-sized common room, (the 
Beach Club, the Bat Cave, and the 
God Quad), or one with a long, wood-
en bar, (the Beach Club and the God 
Quad) can spur competition in the 
room draw. Bat Cave resident Hien 
Tran (SM '94) said she thought some-
one offered one of her roommates 
money if she would forego living in 
the room. Saybrugian Battle and her 
roommates, the first women in years 
6 THE NEw JouRNAL 
to live in the Beach, had to prove they 
he lived until about five years ago. He 
were worthy of the suite. "People were 
donated a picture of a boat that hung 
like, 'Oh, there's girls in the Beach,"' 
above the mantle. From that picture 
Battle said. "We felt a lot of pressure." 
came the name "Beach Club." 

But she said they lived up to expecta-
Students letting loose for the weekend 
tions, throwing several parties last year, 
were shocked to see Gillon show up at 
even a Christmas party with cookies 
Beach Club parties. Maybe they 
and candy. 

In Branford, in past years, win-
should have listened to him earlier in

the week when he announced the

party in class and hinted that he might 
draw, which almost always meant liv-
come. But the end of Gillon's stint at 
· ing in the God Quad. "It was a real 
Yale coincided with the end of another 
strange election," said Adam Dorfman 
era. The picture of the boat no longer

hangs above the mantle. It was stolen 
current God Quad resident. "Are you 
this summer. "It was only a $10 paint-

Quad? Probably more for the God 
Quad." Starting next year, the God 
Quad residents will either be chosen in 
a special early draw or in an election 
for some kind of social chairperson, 
which would clarify the God Quad's 
role as the center of Branford's social 
life. 

These rooms have not always 
smelled of beer. The Bat Cave and the 
Beach Club started out inauspiciously 
as fellow's suites and later became stu-
dent rooms. Former Silliman fellow 
Steve Gillon, who taught history at 
Yale until last year, left a legacy to the 
occupants of the Beach Club, where 
B
ook World also draws its name 
from its centerpiece. About four 
years ago when a New Haven 
bookstore called "Book World" closed 
its doors, the students who then lived 
in Calhoun 426-427 bought the store's 
neon sign. Too large to fit through the 
door, they hoisted it up four floors and 
hauled it through a window. The Bat 
Cave's name comes from a mysterious, 
sealed closet in the room's hallway. 
Someone once likened it to a cave 
where bats would be likely to live. She 
said she thinks the closet is filled with 
asbestos, but the name stuck. The 
Saybrook Beach takes its name from
