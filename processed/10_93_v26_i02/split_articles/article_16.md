For many New Haven residents, John DeStefano's cam-
paign slogan reads like a cruel decree of fate. "It's 
Time," the letters proclaim in red, white, and blue. 
The phrase presumably reflects DeStefano's determination 
to reverse the trend of almost unmitigated deterioration · 
that has left New Haven in a shambles. For many residents 
of New Haven, however, the phrase simply means it is time 
to retire another ·unsuccessful administration that has suc-
cumbed to the sheer difficulty of governing a city whose 
needs vastly outnumber its resources. 

According to the Connecticut Department of Labor, 
unemployment in New Haven peaked at 7.3 percent in July 
of this year, up from an average of 6.6 percent for the whole 
of 1990. More layoffs loom as Sc:IU'thern .

Elections in New Haven have become something of a 
funereal affair. They claim little of the optimism and 
hope for 'regeneration that accompany elections in 
other parts of this country. Some would even say the current 
mayoral election symbolizes the elusiveness of real change. 
John DeStefano has no significant opposition, and yet he 
served as chief administrative officer for the DiLieto admin-
istration, whose corruption and trickle-down economics left 
New Haven with a $12-million debt in 1989. "These guys 
are like ghosts," says local businessman Michael Rosenthal. 
He added, with a fatalism that afflicts many New Haven 
voters, "That's basic big-city politics." 

New England Telephone, dealing with 
the competitive challenges of utility 
deregulation, has encouraged 3,600 
workers to retire or face the possibility 
of being fired. At a time when its resi-
dents can least afford it, the city's prop-
erty taxes have risen in a way that ren-
ders the term "sky-rocket" inadequate.

Although the New Haven press 
has treated the election of DeStefano as a 
."done deal" since the primary, an under-
current of malaise runs through the city.

dus of its residents, with the population falling from 
164,443 in 1950 to 126,109 in 1980. The trend reversed 
itself slightly between 1980 and 1990. But, in the words of 
Board of Aldermen president Tomas Reyes, New Haven 
residents faced with a crumbling city may begin to ask 
themselves, "What am I doing here?" 

It appears that many have already begun to question 
whether anything can really be done to rejuvenate the city. 
Shawn Garris, assistant director of the Dixwell Community 
House, said the majority of New Haven residents, especially 
blacks and Latinos, feel apathetic "because of all the promis-
es on the part of past administrations that never came to 
fruition." Voter turnout surged to nearly 60 percent in the 
1989 election as twice as many black and Latino voters, gal-
vanized by the prospect of the city's first minority mayor, 
showed up at the polls. Turnout is now back to the 1987 
level of around 30 percent. It is especially low among 
blacks, discouraged by the failure of Mayor John Daniels-
once regarded as their best advocate--to redeem City Hall. 

Julia Ficklin, an Mrican-American New Haven resi-
dent, may have captured the fatalistic mood of this election 
when she said, ''I'm not pleased with DeStefano ... but it's a 
done deal. I can't do anything." Ficklin, who usually votes, 


terious poster: a square painted the fluo-
rescent orange of road signs urging caution with a bold-face 
question mark in the middle. These pessimistic placards 
stare dauntingly from the windows of the city's vacant 
buildings. DeStefano promises the second-coming of 
progress while people wonder if it is too late; if the "time" 
has passed. "It's going to be a disaster," said city resident Jim 
O 'Conner. "It doesn't matter who gets elected." 

The apparent "apathy" of New Haven's electorate actu-
ally reflects something much more serious. The whole polit-
ical process has stalled, as it fails to address people's concerns 
in a direct and meaningful way. 

he sped around New Haven in his snazzy, black 
Volkswagen, with kids in tow and the theme song to 
ocky piping out of the radio, Republican .candidate 
Kevin Skiest epitomized the angry citizen taking things into 
his own hands. Searching for fed-up people who could be 
inspired by the. same "insanity" that drove him to take on 
the system, Skiest found frustration coupled with resigna-
tion, people who were angry, but withdrawn. "You've gotta 
be be crazy to want to be mayor of New Haven," one man 
exclaimed when a Skiest volunteer waved a pamphlet at 
him. 


Observers like Skiest volunteer Frank Ragozinno some-
times reduce New Haven politics to the dry observation: 
"It's going to take us years to wake these people up." Yet 
t~e~e are those who are wide awake, just paralyzed with pes-
simism. 

"By the time you get this far, you've sold your soul to 
the devil," said Fair Haven resident Susan Sapp of the 
repeated election of Democrat administrations. But when 
Skiest asked her to join him in a fight for change, she just 
averted her eyes and grinned. "Why did you run as a 
Republican?" she asked Slciest. "It's the kiss of death." 

The DeStefano campaign itself seems to have largely 
taken place in a vacuum. It somehow remains absurdly iso-
lated from those most concerned with the issue of change. 
''I'm not going to vote unless DeStefano says something," 
said a New Haven resident who gave his name as K.C. "It's 
a wait-and-see kind of thing." 

As the Dixwell Q House's Garris observed, politics take 
on an almost surreal aspect in the city's ghettos. People con-
tinually hear about social programs designed to improve life 
in the inner city and yet, says Garris, their neighborhoods 
remain unchanged. 

Skiest points to lack of political dialogue and debate as 
the reason City Hall appears to serve so few of the city's res-
idents. "How can we expect to have accountable govern-
ment when we don't even have an accountable preelection 
format?" Slciest asked, frustrated when DeStefano declined 
to debate him publicly. 

The very separation of people from politics that 
doomed the Daniels' administration may help to usher 
D eStefano into office, Representative Bill Dyson (D-94) 
observed ironically. "If there is any indication of what to 
expect, part of the reason the past administration got voted 
out was for falling out of touch: a few people being able to 
extract whatever they wanted from the system, the rest be 
damned." 

Mournfulness permeates the unnatural calm surround-
ing the current mayoral race. "On the whole I'm pes-
simistic. I think this race symbolizes the deterioration of 
New Haven politics," said Paul Bass, political commentator 
for the New Haven Advocate. 

Can city government still actively engage the city and 
its problems? The answer to this question may lie in 
the person of DeStefano himself 

DeStefano readily acknowledges, "New Haven does nor 
have a lot of time left." He points to a lack of "political con-
sensus" as the city's chief obstacle, and one that can be over-
come. But the question of just what kind of political con-
sensus he will establish remains troubling for many. 

From the election ofRichard Lee in 1953 until the later 
years of the DiLieto administration in the 80s, the 


New Haven awaits political and economic revival. 
Democratic Party enjoyed the reputation of what Alderman l 
" 
Reyes calls "a monolithic power house." Consensus within ~ 
the party was not a problem. Furthermore, prior to the late ~ 
80s, this party consensus seemed to reflect the electorate's ~ 
priorities. Arthur Barbieri (BK '38), Democratic party c: 
chairman since 1953, recalls handily winning elections in ~ 
which there was "70, 80 and 90 percent turn out." 

When an acute fiscal crisis developed in the late 80s, £ 
however, the party's leadership came under fire. In the years _s 
leading up to Daniels' election, the party's ego was severely 5 
deflated, and party organization began to degenerate. 

Many regarded the Daniels campaign as a much needed 
challenge to the political status quo in New Haven. John 
DeStefano, not Daniels, received the endorsement of the 
Democratic party prior to the 1989 Democratic primary. 
"Daniels took the party on," Dyson said. 

He could do this not only because of the widespread 
disenchantment with the DiLieto regime and the increased 
organization of black voters in the wake of Jessie Jackson's 
presidential campaign, but because o~ the extraordinary 
coalition he built. "The Daniels coalition was a rare phe-
nomenon in American politics: a progressive coalition, led 
by blacks and supported by liberal whites and elements of 
the business community," wrote Yale political scientists 
Mary Summers and Philip Klinkers in a 1991 article about 
Daniels' election to office. 

Although most New Haven residents agree that this 
campaign coalition did not meet its full potencial as a gov-
erning coalition, they disagree as to how complete this fail-
ure was, and what caused it. Yale political science professor 
Douglas Rae, who served briefly as Daniels' chief adminis-
trative officer, now calls the Daniels administration "dead
