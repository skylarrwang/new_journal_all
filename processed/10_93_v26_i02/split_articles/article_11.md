EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Between the dark span of the Atlantic Ocean and the 
shallow waters of the Chesapeake Bay lies a narrow 
strip of land known tp Marylanders as the Eastern 
Shore. It is a land of cornfields fringed by fishing villages 
and resort towns, isolated by 30. miles of water and three 
centuries of history from the ~rban sprawl across the Bay. 
For the acclaimed writer Christopher Tilghman (TC '68), it 
is home ground, a place filled with family history and child-
hood memories, and the source of the values that inspire his 
work. 


"My stories have always been filled with a keen sense of 
place," Tilghman says, speaking over the phone from his 
home outside Boston, "with people who are attached to 
land, to nature, and to their families." This sense of history 
and tradition led critics to hail In a Father's Place, 
Tilghman's first collection of stories, as one of the most dis-
tinctive and unusual books of 1990. Michiko Kakutani 
(SM '76) of the New York Times wrote, "Many of 
Tilghman's people come to see their lives not only in terms 
of their immediate families, but also in terms of generations 
within the arc of history." The importance of personal his-
tory in his work, Tilghman says, is rooted in his own experi-
ence. 


The Tilghman family has lived on the Eastern Shore 
since 1650, when a surgeon named Richard Tilghman came 
to Maryland to escape the English Civil War. "The gover-
nor of Maryland gave him a grant of land by the Chester 
River," Tilghman says. "Our family place is on that same 
land." By Tilghman's childhood in the 50s, most of the 
family had moved away from the farm. His father chose to 
continue the family tradition on the Shore, running the 
family farm during the summer while working as a publish-
er in Boston for the rest of the year. Tilghman spent his 
summers in a decaying mansion filled with portraits of his 
ancestors and legends of family ghosts. When not working 
on the farm, he sailed the rivers and creeks of the Shore. 


"I got to see the different cultures of the Shore dose-
up," he says. "The kids I hung around with were the chil-
dren of farmhands, and we'd talk to the seine-hauler fisher-
men who worked on the river." He sensed the age-old ten-
sions of the Shore-between black and white, rich and 
poor, watermen and farmers. In his story "On the 
Rivershore," he wrote about the murder of a Shore fisher-
man by a farmer, and an aging landowner who tries to 
resolve the dispute. "I never witnessed any such dramatic 
event," he says, "but a child absorbs a lot from the attitudes 
of people around him." Over time, he became an accom-
plished sailor and grew to love the water. In his stories, even 
when he changes names of places on the Shore, he never 
alters the details of the waterways. "I remember them too 
well," he says. "Those rivers were as much a home to me as 
the land was." 


Yet Tilghman has always been a visitor to the Eastern 
Shore, part of the first generation of }:lis family that has 
never lived there. For a time, he forgot his roots. "All 
through my early years as a writer," he says, "I had no idea 
of the effect the Eastern Shore had on me." Rediscovering 
the bonds of family and land brought him to write the sto-
ries of In a Fathers Place. In many ways, he was returning 
home. 


Tilghman began his writing career a thousand miles 
from Maryland, on a Navy supply ship in the 
Atlantic. He had been drafted during his senior year 
at Yale, and became a navigator for the Navy three months 
after graduation. At sea, he wrote "volumes" in his jour-
nal-"most of it enraged," he says-and decided to write 
fiction when he was discharged. He had done some writing 
as a child and in high school, but at Yale he was more inter-
ested in music. Being at sea for nearly three years changed 
his perspective. In his story "Norfolk, 1969," he wrote 
about a young sailor who comes to love the sea despite his 
disgust for the military. "The farther the jupiter plowed 
toward the center of the ocean, the more an elemental soul 
asserted itself, swells of time, growing over a million square 
miles," he wrote. "None of the anguishes of that age, none 
of the compromises that had been forced upon him, none 
of the political confusions in his head, mattered anymore." 


In the story, his love for the sea drives a wedge between 
the sailor and his pacifist wife, who finally leaves him when 
he is away. "I wasn't in that situation exactly," Tilghman 
says, "but the conflict was the same-between my political 
feelings and the majesty of the sea." Like the sailor in his 
story, he found something timeless and transcendent in his 
experience on the ocean. He began writing to capture that 
sense of wonder. "It's one of the greatest privileges of being a 
writer," he says, "to be able to spend your time dealing with 
these great mysteries, with this sense of astonishment at 
life." 


Many years passed before Tilghman reached maturity 
as a writer and began to publish. "When I began writing in 
1971," he says, "I had my head full of the French-the crit-
ical theory that I studied in college." His years at Yale came 
at an important juncture in modern literary criticism, when 
the theories of Levi-Strauss, Derrida, and the Marxist critics 
gained prominence. The new methodologies influenced his 
first efforts at a novel. "It was a wildly intellectual enter-
prise," he says, "and not any good at all." After working on 
the novel for six years, he abandoned it and turned to short 
fiction. He found his whole approach to writing changing. 
"I realized I wanted to write about people, not vast theoreti-
cal constructs," he says. "Fiction is not a product of the 
intellect." According to Tilghman, fiction writers have to be 
"dumb"-they have to work from the heart and the gut 
instead of the brain. His stories became more personal, 
reflecting his own experiences as a sailor, as a ranch hand in 
Montana, and as a young husband and father. It was 
inevitable that he would eventually come to write about the 
Eastern Shore. "That was the turning point," he says, "when 
my writing-and in many ways my life--came full circle." 


His current project is a novel, set on the Eastern Shore 
in the 30s. The novel began as a short story, but he found 
there was too much to say. "It calls on many of the experi-
ences I' had as a child," he says. Working in a longer frame-
work allows him to present a larger view of the culture of 
the Shore from different perspectives: watermen and farm-
ers, whites and blacks. "I feel like a kid in a candy store," he 
says about writing the novel. "It's really given me a chance 
to get back to the things I'm closest to." 


In the end, it seems entirely fitting that writing has 
brought Tilghman to appreciate his own background 
and his own history. "Writing for me has always been a 
process of exploration," he says. "You put down everything 
you know and try to discover some connection, some expla-
nation for why things happen." The search for understand-
ing takes place in many of his stories-a sailor finding con-
solation for his loneliness in the ocean, a young man return-
ing to his family ranch to try to understand his parents. 
One reviewer called the search "the desire of his characters 
to reckon with their lives as a whole." In Tilghman's view, it 
is the most important thing anyone can do. "We have to 
explore these things," he says. "It's the only way we'll ever 
understand just what we're doing here."
