EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Guitar Man stands by the Co-op, baseball cap backwards, instrument in hand, and his case wide open 
on the ground, welcoming donations. 

"Hey Cliff!" someone waves. 

Without skipping a beat he bids a good afternoon and 
goes right on singing "Kansas City Baby." Students often 
say they never hear him play anything else. 

Clifford H. Byrd, born and raised in New Haven, is a 
familiar face on Broadway. I often hear students mention 
the Guitar Man in dining hall conversations: "Who is he?" 
people ask, "I've always wanted to talk to that man." "He's 
the only guy on the street I give money to." All seem to agree 
that he's different from the others that frequent the sidewalk. 
He has a certain energy about him. 

"Sure I'll help you with the article," he says as he leans 
on a newspaper dispenser. "Some brother wanted to write a 
book about my life once .... You know what I can do for you? 
You want to write a book? Honey, can I tell you stories .... " I 
smell alcohol on his breath. 

"You see, tomorrow's Friday and I have to work real 
hard so I can make enough money for a ticket and cab 
to go see my girl. If you can spare anything, I really 
need it. She's in prison, and she needs me. 

They only let me see her twice a week, and when she sees me 
that gives her hope to live ... it keeps her strong." He points to 
his guitar. "Right now, that's my only way." 

"I've heard you give guitar lessons," I say. 

"I sure do. Don't have anyone at the moment, but if you 
know anyone .... I need the money to go see my girl. She's a 
beautiful, lovely flower ... I love her." Cliff pauses. "When she 
gets out we're gonna be married." He tilts his head to the 
side and talks about her for a while. "I got her off drugs. 
She'd been busted for drugs and escaped, but she's straight 
now. She's gonna be OK. You know what? I put her there ... I 
busted my own lady for her own good, because I seen her ......, 
running out of motivation. When she comes home I'll keep 
her away from that old environment ... she's had her ups and 
downs but she'll be OK; she's into the Lord now." 

"You believe in God?" I ask. 

Cliff breaks into a ten minute speech about the Lord 
Jesus and God's everlasting Grace and forgiveness. He plays 
piano at church every Sunday and reads the Bible nearly 
every day. I ask him 
where he finds his 
faith. 

"you see 
that tree over there? 
Man can make a lot 
of things, but no 
matter what, he 
can't make a liv-
ing, 
breathing 
tree, and man 
can't create those 
stars and the 
moon. He can 
only make a 
replica. So I 
know. 

I 
may 
be 
smokin' 
this 
cigarette, and drinkin' a little wine, but 
God still loves me for what I am." 

"I don't do drugs because that 
ain't cool. But I've been there," 
he says. "I almost died off of 
drugs .... My heart was going 'BOOM 
BOOM BOOM,' and my head felt 
like a pumpkin, and I said, 'Yo buddy, 
something ain't right. This stuff's 
killing me."' Cliff feels that God gave 
him another chance to live. "We all 
got a right to live, but if you throw it 
away, then consider it thrown." 

He tells me he was on coke. "At 
the time I thought that was really hap-
penin'," he drawls. "I was young ... I 
didn't care about dying ... I wanted 
guns ... I wanted money .... Thank God I 
didn't kill no one. I've never killed any-
one. When I was in Vietnam I didn't 
kill no one either. I'm a Vietnam vet 
you know, honest to God. 

"I'm not a hoodlum like some of 
my brothers, God bless them. I see my 
brothers on the street with ten dollars 
to rush to get a fix." He says he's differ-
ent and wants people to see it. He says 
he's not a beggar, just a man trying to 
make a living with his guitar." 

I ask him how he started playing 
the guitar: he explains that music was 
his first love. As a boy he would listen 
to his grandfather play gospel music-
and the blues, when his grandmother 
wasn't listening. Cliff has loved music 
ever since. God gave him a gift, he says, 
the gift to play any instrument. He's a 
self-taught guitarist with perfect pitch 
and a photographic memory. "I'm not 
bragging," he insists. "It's something 
God gave me." 

Cliff says he's never had to "beck-
on down to white supremacy." "I'm 
not in college, but I know what that is. 
I'm an American black man, and thank 
God I'm not in Africa with them lions. 
I stand on my own, and that's my way. 

"I respect myself so others can 
respect me too, and if you treat others 
like you want them to treat you, then 
nothing goes wrong. I love what I do .... 
I can be a millionaire tomorrow with 
my guitar. Everyone here's got a 
chance." 

"You really believe that?" I ask 
with some skepticism. 

"You have to help yourself-
that's 
all it takes. I mean, look at you and me, 
we can write that book." I laugh. 

"That's why all the nationalities come 
around here .... But I'm a realist, the 
white man is running this country. You 
should know it," he waves his hand 
towards me. "They're using your peo-
ple as a trade country." I'm Korean-
American. "They know you guys are 
makin' the dollars ... I don't have to go 
to Yale to know that. America needs 
that trade ... that's why they're being so 
sweet and kind. 

Otherwise, they 
wouldn't have time for you, as they 
don't have for some in this country that 
need help. There's a lot of people here 
that need help and don't get it." 

"Hi Cliff." Two students 
come by. "I've got some-
thing for you." One of 
them hands him a five dollar bill. 

"Hey, you know, I got a song for 
you tonight," he says and breaks into 
the blues. He cracks a few jokes in 
between refrains and his audience of 
two laughs good naturedly. After the 
song he asks if we enjoyed it. 

"Very much," one of the students 
reply. 

"Then that made me enjoy it too," 
he bows. 

After they leave he turns to me. "I 
love them. God bless them. Not 
because he gave me five dollars," Cliff 
insists. "Because he's a human being. It 
doesn't matter what color you are, we're 
all brothers and sisters under God. 

Without God in your soul, you're 
among the living dead." 

Evidently, I'm not the first student 
to approach him. Some upper-
classmen know him and even 
play guitar with him on occasion. Cliff 
tells me he's seen students come and go 
after years at Yale. 

"My friend in Switzerland wrote 
me a letter and says when he comes 
back he'll buy me chicken, because he 
knows I love chicken." Cliff has a 
throaty laugh. "That made me feel 
good. You know why? 'cause he knows 
me." 

Kansas City, here I come. 

As it gets dark, I shiver and notice 
the evening chill. With a hand-
shake and a friendly smile, Cliff 
and I part company. 

"See you 
around," he says. Walking away, I 
begin to wonder what exactly it means 
to know someone. How many people 
know Cliff as more than just Guitar 
Man, as more than just the indigenous 
figure on the Broadway sidewalk? 

How many imagine that the Guitar 
Man in front of the Co-op with a 
cigarette dangling from his mouth 
could also be a political commentator, 
a self-rehabilitated anti-drug activist, 
and a God-fearing advocate of the 
Golden Rule? Everyone's got a story. 
Sometimes, all it takes to find out is a 
willingness to look deeper than an 
open guitar case.
