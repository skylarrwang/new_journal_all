T
he Big Bang was only the beginning. The universe is 
perpetually destroying and continually creating itself. 
Swirling clouds of dust become planets, exploding 
stars collapse into black holes. Within dying stars, the fusicm 
of hydrogen and helium takes place, involving intense ener-
gy, heat, and pressure. For years, scientjsts, seeking to under-
'S stand the intricate mechanisms behind the universe's contin-
~ ual self-creation and self-destruction, attempted to determine 
'l the rate at which helium burns inside a massive star's core . 

This .rate indicates the ratio of carbon to oxygen formed 
~ within the core's nuclear fusion reactions. Since 
1 this simple ratio can reveal the eventual fate 
] of massive stars, the race to ~lculate its 
~ value became one of the preeminent 
§ quests of modern astrophysics. 

The rate of helium burning 
~ has finally been measured. In 
; April, rwo independent research 
.£ teams, one at Yale, led by Moshe 
~ Gai, associate professor o 
t physics; and the other at Tri-
University Meson Facility (TRI-
UMF) in Canada, discovered 
within their laboratories what once 
could only be reproduced on com-
puter simulations. Gai and a handful 
Yale students achieved the same end as 
TRIUMF did with a $50-million research bud-
get and the collaboration of three universities. The Yale 
and TRIUMF experiments found out what Gai calls the 
"number one unknown in nuclear astrophysics." 

Yale and TRIUMF submitted their fmal research papers 
a week apart. Alhough the rwo teams discovered the rate of 
helium burning through different methods, they reached 
remarkably similar results and confirmed prior computer 
predictions. 

As a result of the success of Gai's team and TRIUMF, 
scientists now know that approximately 85 percent of carbon 
atoms formed within massive stars fuse with helium and 
become oxygen. Knowing that more stars produce a great 
deal of oxygen has increased the chances that a greater num-
ber of massive stars will "skip" subsequent reactions and 
become supernovas. In addition, the calculated value of the 
carbon-oxygen ratio can help scientists predict how dense the 
core of a supernova will be, and if that supernova will col-
lapse into a black hole. 

At Yale, Gai led a team composed of Zhiping Zhao 
(GRD '93), Ralph H. France III (GRD '94), Kin Seng Lai 
(GRD '97), Steve L. Rugari (GRD '90), Edward 1:.. Wilds 
from the University of Connecticut, and a number of under-
graduates from Yale and other universities. Zhao, now at the 
University of Washington in Seattle, chose the problem of 
determining the rate of helium burning as her Ph.D. thesis 
topic under Gai's supervision. 

After intensive observations and calculations, scientists 
knew that a star roughly 25 times more massive than the sun 
lasts about 7.5 million years before it becomes an 
exploding star, a supernova. Scientists consider a 
star "massive" when its mass exceeds six times 
the mass of the sun. These stars expend 
huge amounts of energy .in the hydrogen 
'and helium fusion reactions within their 
cores. The cores violently contract, 
increasing the pressure and temperature 
within the cores. This tumultuous 
compression of the core leads to the 
massive star's devolution into a red 
giant. At the same time, the star's outer 
shell expands, while reactions within the 
core continue to expend energy furiously. 

During the first 7 million of these final 
years, the star produces helium from the 
fusion of hydrogen nuclei. In the last 500,000 
years, when this reaction of hydrogen nuclei has been 
nearly exhausted, helium fusion predominates. Inside the. 
star's core, fusion reactions involving three alpha particles 
(helium nuclei) bring about the formation of carbon-12. A 
nucleus of carbon-12 can then capture another alpha particle 
to make oxygen-16. 

The carbon/oxygen core continues to release tremen-
dous amounts of energy. Temperatures within the star reach-
levels beyond measurements of nuclear physics. As the core 
contracts, iron is produced inside the core. The dying star's 
extremely dense center finally collapses into a neutron star, a 
remnant of the core, or collapses further into a black hole. 
This stellar corpse creates tremendous gravity, sucking matter 
and light into its fathomless black chasm. 

he ratio of carbon-12 to oxygen-16 indicates more 
than just the characteristics of a star's core. This ratio 
allows astrophysicists to estimate three things: how 
quickly heavy elements--such as silicon, neon, and sulfur-
form within the star, in what order these elements form, and 
from indirect measurement, the timing and eventual fate of 
the star's explosion as a supernova. If the helium-burning 
reaction ·within a particular massive star produces small 
amounts of oxygen, heavy elements will ~e formed before the 
star reaches the supernova stage. If, however, the helium-
burning reaction produces significantly more oxygen, reac-
tions forming the heavy elements are "skipped" and the stars 
become supernovas much faster than expected. For scientists 
observing a star at the supernova stage, the carbon-oxygen 
ratio can be a factor in determining whether or not this star's 
core will become dense enough to. collapse into a black hole. 

The combined rate of these two linked reactions 
involved in helium burning determines the overall ratio of 
carbon-12 to oxygen-16 within the core of a massive star. 
Scientists had already discovered the first reaction rate but 
the rate of the second reaction, involving the transformation 
of carbon-12 into oxygen-16, had yet to be calculated. 

Physicist Steve Koonin and colleagues at the California 
Institute of Technology and independent researchers in 
Belgium in 1985 predicted that the second reaction rate of 
helium burning could be measured in the laboratory. 

Researchers, however, found it difficult to duplicate the 
nuclear fusion reaction processes inside a star's extremely 
high temperature core within the mundane conditions of the 
laboratory. The teams at Yale and TRIUMF saw an alterna-
tive method for measuring the second reaction rate. 

They decided to run the entire helium-burning reaction 
backwards. "The laws of physics are completely invariant 
under the transformation of time," says Gai. By reversing 
the reaction, the two teams calculated the reaction rate and 
determined the ratio of carbon-12 to oxygen-16 more easily. 

Professor Gai calls reversing the helium-burning reaction 
"just a clever trick to allow us to measure small quantities." 

Gai's research team fired a beam of deuterium {an iso-
tope of hydrogen) at a thin sheet of titanium doped with 
nitrogen. The deuterium beam's impact on the thin sheet of 
titanium and nitrogen created an isotope of nitrogen, nitro-
gen-16. Since nitrogen-16 is very unstable, the isotope 
immediately decays into oxygen-16. Oxygen-16 further 
decays into carbon-12 and helium. This process i~ simply the 
reverse of the second helium-burning reaction, officially 
known in its experimental reaction formula 12c(a , y) 16o, 
where a and y signifY. garcicle recapture by carbon-12 ( 12c) 
to create oxygen-16 ( 1 0). 

The team filled dozens of laboratory booklets with long, 
consistent calculations of the experiment. "We spent about 
13 weeks actually getting data for this experiment, and those 
13 weeks ran 24 hours a day for about five and half days dur-
ing the week," says France, one of the Yale graduate students 
working on the project. After nearly five years of work, Gai's 
team finally measured the reverse reaction and could calcu-
late, 
using 
quantum 
mechanics, how 
many times the 
forward reac-
tion can happen 
inside the star's 
core. By obtain-
ing this reaction 
rate, the Yale 
team 
could 
compute 
the 
proportion of 
carbon-12 and 
oxygen-16 
formed in the 
final stages of 
nuclear fusion Physics professor Mosh~ Gai and studmt 
before a star Ralph K France measured the rate of helium 
explodes. 

Around the same time, TRIUMF, a huge venture spe-
cializing in nuclear and particle physics founded in 1968 by 
the universities of Alberta, British Columbia, and Victoria, 
and Simon Fraser University, used a different technique 
based on the same principle of the reverse reaction to discov-
er the second reaction rate. Researchers first produced a 
beam of nitrogen-16 and then fired this beam into a target 
composed of carbon-12. Special detectors gauged similarities 
between the emission of alpha particles and the emission of 
carbon nuclei from the disintegration of oxygen-16 nuclei 
created within that target. 

In the July 1993 issue of Discover, Gai comments, "Now 
we have only four, perhaps five, very good candidates for 
black holes. We know, based on our results, that we should 
see many more." The information gained from these experi-
ments can also help scientists explain what will be inevitable 
within our own solar system. "Our sun, for about 4.6 billion 
years, has been fusing hydrogen into helium," adds Gai. "In 
another 5 billion years it will expand into a red giant. The 
radius of the sun will then include the earth, with tempera-
tures around 6,000° C." 

Both research teams are still trying to lower the system-
atic error in their experiments, which would make their 
results more reliable. Nevertheless, their results remain an 
elegant description of the death of stars and the birth of 
black holes. Yale and TRIUMF's measurement of the heli-
um-burning reaction rate has brought science closer to 
understanding the processes behind the continuous creation 
and destruction of the universe.

remember my family; I have a photograph. What a time 
it was. Two parents, two kids, all in one house. A time 
of innocence. 
I feel much less innocent now, three years after leaving 
the house. I can visit the people in my family, but the fami:.

explain easily or concretely. The changes I can describe 
look petty when I record them. The real changes are tonal, 
intangible. My home feels jarring and dissonant to me.

we would be living in a soap opera, bewailing our fortunes 
over tepid cups of coffee. Behind funny fronts and stories of
