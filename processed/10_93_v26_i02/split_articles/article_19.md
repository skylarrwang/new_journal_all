issues," she says. "We're all sort of ruled by the supermarket. 

They used to go to Superfresh on I Oth Street. My mom still 
goes to Superfresh, but my dad goes down to the Pathmark 
at the airport," she explains. She's not sure why he does that; 
he says Pachmark is bigger, but "he always buys the same 
things." Path mark is so far away that often there's no food at 
her father's house. So her 16-year-old brother often stops off 
at Mom's to eat after school, even when it's Dad's custodial 
time. Beth's parents got joint custody of the kids and the 
cleaning lady, but her mom got the supermarket. 

While her brother lets his stomach lead him home, 
Beth has a harder time deciding where to go for vacations. 
"Since I went to college, I have two houses. My Dad lives in 
my house. My mom lives in an apartment. I don't exactly 
have a bedroom there-I have a pink closet with a bed in 
it," she says. "It's hard for me to decide where to spend my

of self until she got to college. But during her first year 
at Yale, she was shaken by her sister's questions about 
how healthy their family really was. She opens a

anymore. 

"I am afraid, because I can feel that 
our family is going to fall apart over 
the years and I don't think there is 
anything I can do about it. I'm 
scared. It's hard to just stand 
around and watch my fami-
ly self-destruct, helpless. 

Now my sister is going 
to move away, far 
away from us, 
and

won't, I know it, I'm positive of it, I can see it all happening 
in front of my face. It's like watching a bad suspense movie. 
You can only sit and watch the movie play out, or you can 
get up and leave. I don't want to get up and leave." 

As she reads, Alisa chuckles at the high drama of her 
own words, and at how young they seem three years later. 
While A lisa's sister challenged her notions of 
family, her father affirmed chem by moving to 
Boston from California, mostly to be 
closer co Alisa. ''I'd say my dad more 
than my mom suffers from whatev-

your kids leave home," 
Alisa says. "My sis-
