city's buildings not paying real estate 
taxes," said local real estate developer 
Joel Schiavone (BR '58), bemoaning 
Mayor Daniels' decision to build more 
low-income housing as a "disaster." 
"You can't operate like a liberal demo-
crat in the 90s. A successful mayor will 
have co be more centrist," Schiavone 
said, adding that he saw DeStefano 
heading in this direction. 

DeStefano's creative proposals 
suggest he has grappled with the issues 
and sees the need for change. He has 
disassociated himself from the trickle-
down economics that spurred many a . 
futile development project in New

Haven. Instead, seemingly aware of 
what Rae called the "overwhelming 
evidence that New Haven will not be a 
retail center for the region," DeStefano 
has opposed the building of the 
Taubman Mall. In calling for an 
increased emphasis on strengthening 
the city's existing institutions, such as 
biomedical technology, DeStefano has 
injected some much-needed pragma-
tism into the politics of a city given to 
pursuing unrealistic cure-ails. 

Furthermore, DeStefano has given 
an indication he will place sound judg-
ment before politics. A Catholic, 
DeStefano has supported the distribu-
tion of condoms at middle schools-
~ an idea that is unpopular in the 
!i Catholic community, whose support 
t he may need to stay in office. 

DeStefano's approach co the prob-
~ lem of exorbitant and inequitable 
1i property taxes aims at long-term 
~reform rather than a quick-fix solu-
~ cion. He proposes filing suit against 
~ the Connecticut legislature ro make 
~ suburbanites share the burden of taxa-
e tion for city services-services they 
f 
now use largely at rhe expense of New 
Haven's taxpayers. "The objective is 
not a successful lawsuit so much as to 
enhance the urgency of discussion of 
the issue," DeStefano said. 

DeStefano's campaign seems par-
ticulary bold and even progressive for 
having emerged in the midst of a polit-
ical freeze. No popular movement 
pressures him to reform. Yet, as 
Summers said, "DeStefano's campaign 
makes me feel as if the whole nature of 
political debate in New Haven has 
changed." 

But while city politics may con-
tinue to evolve, one still cannot 
shake the feeling that those at 
the helm ofNew Haven's political pro-
cess today are there by default. 
Widespread sentiment that city gov-
ernment is destined to fail prevents 
many would-be mayors from mount-
ing a serious opposition. 

The mayoral sear is "a job char 
nobody wants," according to Bass. 
"Any other strong candidate would 
have had DeStefano in a mental hospi-
tal within a week, because he can't take 
criticism," Bass said. 

Another reason people have diffi-
culty taking the mayoral race seriously 
may be that they take place in such 
rapid-fire succession, with elections 
every two years. Voters simply can't 
distinguish one race from another. 

The Democrats, who have opposed 
increasing term length to four years, 
are sometimes seen as exploiting this 
obstacle to a fully organized opposi-
tion. "Over the past 40 years 
Board of Education there are 9,000 
city jobs. All of these people have a few 
relatives in New Haven," he said. 
"That's 30,000 votes. These are people 
who vote their jobs and not the 
. 
" 
1ssues. 

Of course, political debate takes 
place between 
factions of the 
Democratic party itself. Reflecting on 
the primary, Reyes said, "We put 
cogether a straightforward discussion 
of issues because of which DeStefano 
is much aware of the issues of the 
inner-city." 

But in New Haven, where past 
administrations seem to have fallen 
our of touch, few would deny the need 
for greater communication between 
City Hall and the community. 

"Accountability" is a buzz word. 
Reyes himself has launched a "cam-
paign for the betterment of New 
Haven" which aims, among other 
things, co "provide a bridge between 
the administration and the communi-
ty." 

Ultimately, one cold fact under-
lies all the political rhetoric. As loudly 
as people proclaim "It's time" for 
accountable government, and "It's 
time" for lower taxes, and "It's time" 
for more jobs, the economy sleeps 
soundly on. The fate of New Haven's 
next mayor lies more on the good will 
of Washington, D.C., and Hartford 
than in New Haven itself.
