people he loves." With her father in Boston, the family feels more solid to Alisa now than it did freshman year. Her sister and mother have problems, but she sees her sister at their dad's. She still worries about Christmas, and not spending it with her sister, without whom she once felt she could not keep her family a family. But now she questions whether her family has really crumbled in the last three years or whether she has just realized that they weren't so solid to begin with.


Her mother's leg pain started the weekend Jenny's parents brought her to school freshman year. "By the time I was a junior there was a disabled sticker on the car," she says, describing her mother's pain, her inability to walk, the surgery she's had, and the surgery she still needs in order to recover fully. In the midst of the lengthy catalogue of ailments and symptoms, she begins to laugh, a little ruefully. What else can she do? How else can you handle a parent's debilitating illness when you're hundreds of miles away?


The family has changed since she went away and her mother got sick. "My sister just doesn't come home anymore," she says, shrugging and pacing around her common room, picking lint off the carpet, straightening things that don't need to be straightened. Her parents are unable to keep her 17-year-old sister home at night. They don't know where she goes, and Jenny doesn't think they want to. Jenny has a pretty good idea and is very worried. But she's too far away to help, or even to be involved.


When Jenny lived at home, "there were rules. There were a lot of rules. We had curfews, we weren't allowed to drive the car at night-I don't know, what rules do you have? We weren't allowed to do things," she says, now slouching on a saggy couch, face down turned.


Jenny knows that her being at home would not make her mother better. She feels guilty at being away only because when she's home, some of the old rules come back into play. Her sister stays in line more when she's at home. When Jenny's home, she knows where her sister's going, what's up.


But slouched on her couch tonight, she's not feeling that she can make a difference at home. Her sister has been difficult since infancy. And her mother's illness is "a definite medical thing. It isn't a direct result of my coming to college," she says. But she hesitates. "Is it?"
