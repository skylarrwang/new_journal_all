EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the outskirts of rhe city, in a dingy second-story 
room, three friends dress for battle in the late summer 
heat. Red padding covers heads and groins, and gloves 
slide over carefully raped fists. Smiles turn to scowls. In one 
month, these three will be fighting for state championships in 
separate weight classes. Today, under the watchful eye of their 
trainer, theY. will rake turns pummeling each other. 

This second-floor room is the home of Ring One, New 
Haven's one and only boxing gym. The trainer, 34-year-old 
Brian Clarke, is at the moment standing amidst the combat-
ants, lacing their gloves. He could hardly look more out of 
place. Brian's got long blond hair and the chiseled features of a 
Last Action Hero. It's only when he speaks, something he is 
known ro do for hours on e·nd, that his boxing expertise and 
his deep commitment to his fighters surface. Brian is part 
inner-city activist, parr boxing coach. The activist Brian will 
talk passionately about "keeping kids off the street" and how 
boxing can give kids the discipline to succeed. Then the coach 
Brian will reemerge, grinning. "I can train a kid," he'll say, so 
emphatically that you can't help but think his kids are in awfully-
good hands. 

Brian's three proteges are Willie Medina, 26, the gym's 
most experienced and respected fighter; Damon Harris, 18, a 
recent Wilbur Cross High School graduate who has been box-
ing for three months; and Pedro Carmona, 21, a young man 
who has begun to turn his life around with dreams of profes-
sional boxing. None of them looks particularly friendly right 
now. Willie and Damon are limbering up in the ring, which is 
really nothing more than a thin floor mat, ring posts, and 
rope-all patched together with duct-tape. Willie and Damon 
will box for two rounds, followed by Willie and Pedro, then 
Damon and Pedro. 

With three urgent blasts from a buzzer, Willie and Damon 
face each other, knees bem, gloves raised. Everyone else in the 
gym, ten or so men and boys working at punching bags, turn 
their attention to the ring. "Box!" Brian commands, and the 
fists start flying. Two sounds can be heard: the whoosh of 
exhaled breath and the thud of fists hitting bodies and fists hit-
ting heads. From the outset, Willie controls the action, land-
ing punches with tremendous power. "Willie, throw that hook 
in there," Brian directs from outside the ring. "OK," Willie 
responds coolly, deftly mixing the punch into his barrage. 

Damon, meanwhile, who's faster than Willie, tries to use his 
speed to his advantage. Damon's got the right game plan, but 
Willie is too strong and experienced. 

The buzzer ends the round. Damon looks relieved. By

Brian's buzzer, blaring insistently through the windows. Go up 
the staircase. When the smell of sweat begins to overpower the 
smell of automobiles, you'll know you've arrived. 

Visiting Ring One for the 
first time early in the summer, 
before Damon and Pedro have 
ever set foot in the gym, I don't 
find any sparring going on. 
Brian walks over to me, and an 
incredibly enthusiastic, impas-

again, explaining how he

education to all his kids and 
how boxing can be an integral 
part of that education. 

"Boxing teaches these kids self-
sufficiency," he says. "You get

I'm standing there punchdrunk, overwhelmed by the flurry 
I of cliches. I feel as if I've heard it all before. Politicia[ls talking 
iB about keeping kids off.Jhe street. Big-time college football 
;it COaches talking about putting education first. Brian sounds sin-
cere, but in these first few moments I'm skeptical. The next 
time I hear the cliches, I won't be. I'll realize that Ring One is, 
in many ways, itself a cliche-the dingy, sweat-stained ring, the 
!I Young fighters clinging to their dreams, the charismatic coach 
rJ 
who can't stop talking. And then I'll realize that here, unlike 
any other place I've visited, the cliches are all real. 

What convinces me is a visit to the back corner of the gym, 
a tiny area set off with blue tarpaulins where Brian says he's got a 
scrapbook that he wants to show me. Inside these blue 
tarpaulins, along with the scrapbook and assorted other memo-
rabilia, is something I don't expect to see: a bed. This tiny cor-
ner of the gym is where Brian sleeps. 

"lfl the winter I can see my breath at night," he says.

pening Brian's scrapbook like opening a floodgate. 
Brian's stories pour out, one after another, at a relent-
less, exuberant pace. The stories revolve around a set 
cast of characters. None of them trains at Ring One anymore, 
but they remain presences in the gym. They are the ones whose 
names are written on fight posters or directly onto the walls 
under words like "State Champion." The older men in the 
gym, at the mention of their names, will nod and smile. Brian, 
a gifted yarn-spinner, can conjure them all up, re-creating the 
way they talked and the way they carried themselves in the ring. 

Many of Brian's stories center on Kareem Wali, 15 years old 
when he fought for Ring One. Even at that age, Brian says, 
Kareem showed more talent than any other fighter who has set 
foot in Ring One. Brian says he altered Kareem's birth certifi-
cate so that he could fight older boys when his peers no longer 
presented a challenge. "Kareem firmly believed that he was 
never going to lose," the coach says. 

Kareem's confidence disintegrated in one night, at the New 
England Golden Gloves in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Kareem 
was fighting in the finals against a local kid with an amazing left 
hook who everyone thought was unbeatable. On fight night, 
Kareem performed beautifully, dominating the local kid and 
even swaying the hometown crowd. Then, inexplicably, the 
judges gave the fight to the local kid. Kareem broke down. 
"There was a lot of shit going on in the ring, so I told my other 
fighters to take Reemy down to the locker room," Brian says. 
"When I got down there a few minutes later, he wasn't around. 
I found my kid crying in a bathroom stall." 

After the Golden Gloves it became an impossibility to keep 
Kareem focused on boxing. "He pulled out of eight fights in a 
row," Brian says. "I used to chase him all around New Haven."

Brian has no 
illusions about

ing. It's a grimy 
The two quarreled, and, eventually, 
the coach threw Kareem out of the 
gym. He wasn't committed to being a 
fighter anymore. Kareem still calls 
Brian to say he wants to get back into 
the sport. The coach has al~wed 
Kareem back into the gym on several 
occasions. Each time, though, Kareem 
has failed to follow through. 

With lightning quickness, the 
subject turns to Reggie Higgins, 
Brian's closest approach to training a 
pro. "Reggie was the first fighter that I 
developed from scratch," Brian says. 
"He was my fighter. And if a kid's 
your fighter, then no matter where he 
goes he's still your fighter." Boxing 
coaches like to see their athletes as 
works of art which only they can com-
plete. Reggie was Brian's first creation. 

world, in which a handful of extraordi-
narily talented fighters get fame and 
fabulous wealth while the vast majori-
ty toil in obscurity and near poverty. 

Still, Brian dreams. "I thought for 
sure Reggie would go pro. But I want 
pros chat I developed. If a great fight-.. 
er walked in here tonight from another 
gym, I'd send him away." 

T
he scrapbook closes. Sitting 
inside the blue carps in a near-
empty gym on this early sum-
mer day, Brian is as far from training a 
professional fighter as he has ever 
been. 

Brian thinks that if he could move 
the gym into the Hili section of New 
Haven, he could have more fighters 
like Reggie and Kareem. It's easy to 
puc, relying on membership dues ($20 
per month for adults, $10 for kids; 
kids with a B-average or better in 
school train for free) and whatever he 
can scrape together from his day job at 
a health food store. 

Brian has probably thought harder 
about the mind set of inner-city kids 
than any ocher community activist or 
educator in New Haven. "It's a lesson 
in psychology up here every day," he 
says. The coach claims that he can tell 
exactly what a kid is chinking by the 
way he moves in the gym. Brian tells a 
story about one of his favorite little 
kids, a 14-year-old named Rolando, 
who he surmised was being beaten at 
home by the way he reacted to Brian's 
demonstration of punching technique. 
Every time Brian would move his fist 
in Rolando's direction, the kid would 
shrink, as if he were anticipating being 
hie. Rolando ended up staying at Ring 
One for several days, with Brian, until 

Almost as soon as Reggie sec foot 
in Ring One, he and Brian became 
inseparable. They trained together, 
hung out together, and celebrated vic-
tory after victory together. Brian 
recalls post-fight revelry almost as 
vividly as he recalls the fights them-
selves. 

see why. Both of them, like...----------....---.------=-----.--~ 
At 25, Reggie began to catch the 
eyes of professional boxing promoters. 
One by one, with practiced smiles and 
dazzling promises, they came, each 
with his own bit of advice for Brian's 
fighter. "I was losing the grip," Brian 
says. Increasingly, Reggie insisted on 
doing things his own way. 

It was not until Reggie did the 
unthinkable that Brian and Reggie's 
relationship fell apart: Reggie sparred 
at another gym. "You just don't do 
that," the coach explains. It's a betray-
al that still smarts, even after two 
years. "I would rather have my girl-
friend fucking someone else. There 
are plenty of other women out there, 
but how many great fighters?" Reggie 
never did go pro. After leaving Ring 
One, he was never the same fighter.

kids, live on the Hill. It's 
one of New Haven's most 
deprived neighborhoods, a 
place presumably full of 
young men who would be 
drawn to the "poor man's 
sport" of boxing. Brian has 
tried to enlist the city's help 
to move the gym, but he's 
run into nothing but red 
tape. Politician's rhetoric, 
unlike Brian's, packs no 
punch. None of the politi-
cians goes home to a smelly, 
dingy gym on the outskirts 
of town. 

With a mere $10,000 
grant, Brian estimates, he 
could move to the Hill and 
run a program for 30 kids 
for a year. "What the fuck 
do you think you're getting 
here? You're getting kids
