desperately needed financing—is to advocate for 
themselves, time and time again. 


Over the last few years, the pandemic 
compounded frustrations that had always 
existed among parents and educators. In 2021, 
Connecticut received $346 million in federal 
COVID-19 relief funding, dedicated specifically 
to providing operational support for stability 
and expansion in the childcare industry. But that 
one-time funding has now dried up. Meanwhile, 
childcare professionals risked their lives daily to 
uphold their commitments to their students and 
their communities, as well as the broader economy. 
There was no better opportunity for the state to 
show its appreciation than the 2022-2023 Biennial 
Budget Report, the first iteration of which was 
approved by the legislature in 2021.

A year later in February of 2022, upon 
the release of forecasted budget adjustments, 
Goldburn waited three days to allow the policy 
team at the Connecticut Voices for Children and 
Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance to analyze 
childcare centers’ budgets. The Alliance confirmed 
her worst fears: Connecticut legislators had allo­
cated no additional funding to support the indus­
try. In the next two weeks, Goldburn and her 
colleagues—Bermúdez Zimmerman from Child 
Care for Connecticut and Schiavone, along with 
other providers and policy experts representing 
childcare centers, coalitions, and universal child 
care campaigns across the state—mobilized. On 
March 15, 2022, three hundred and fifty childcare 
professionals, parents, and their children staged 
a “Morning Without Child Care” demonstration 
on the New Haven Green from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. 
Goldburn and her colleagues stepped away from 
their work lives to demonstrate what would hap­
pen if the childcare industry withdrew their ser­
vices, even if just for an hour. 

“We struggled about removing what [fami­
lies] need to survive to ‘punish’ or raise awareness 
for decision-makers,” Schiavone said about the 
ethical dilemma of hitting pause on the workforce. 
Educators feared if they had not called people to 
action, no one would have.

The action worked. In May of 2022, 
Connecticut boasted a shiny new armistice: “The 
biggest investment in child care [and] education…
in our state’s history.” The amended 2022-2023 
biennial budget report allocated $183 million to 
the early childhood education industry, a more 
than twofold increase in what they had been 
previously receiving from the state. “There was 
a straight line between what we did in that rally 
and what was put in the budget,” Goldburn told 
me. And still, this figure represented just a quarter 
of the investment needed for survival.

The message of the first “Morning Without 
Child Care” rally in 2022 resonated with child­
care providers, parents, and families nationwide. 
Advocates in Connecticut more than doubled 
their state’s investment in early childhood and 
education center held off on charging her from 
February through June while Care 4 Kids evalu­
ated its case. Moore was not interested in paying 
a “second mortgage” for child care—and neither 
was her sister, Karla Hicks. Following Moore’s 
advice, Hicks applied for the Care 4 Kids subsidy 
in September of 2022 and was approved within a 
month, just before the annual wave of fall appli­
cations. Hicks attributes her acceptance to the 
good fortune of insider knowledge: “If you don’t 
know about [Care 4 Kids] on your own, you 
would never know about it.”

Jameila McKee, a full-time working mother 
of two infants and a New Haven resident, also 
found Care 4 Kids’ uncertain process to inter­
fere with her job. In McKee’s experience, the 
stress was not only in affording daycare but also 
in finding an available one. McKee’s Care 4 Kids 
application was a several-month-long process 
that could not begin until after her acceptance 
and commitment to a daycare, many of which 
have sizable waitlists. McKee was working full 
time and struggled to simultaneously tour day­
cares and continue paying her bills. While day­
care providers aim to uphold their commitment 
to foster partnerships between educators and 
parents, not every parent can afford to take on 
their part of that commitment.

Another New Haven parent, Asia Huff, 
had heard of Care 4 Kids, but her knowledge of 
the program was limited until after giving birth, 
when a woman started visiting with check-ins, 
plug covers, pantry items, gift cards, and the 
suggestion that she apply. The woman was an 
agent for the Nurturing Families Network, a 
state-funded program that strives to work col­
laboratively with “high-risk first-time parents” 
by providing educational and emotional relief. 
Free of charge, she supported Huff postpar­
tum, including advising her on the Care 4 Kids 
application. “Without the woman that comes 
to visit me, I would be lost,” Huff told me. 

The parents I spoke with emphasized how 
Care 4 Kids is wrapped in an implicit exclu­
sivity—and these barriers to entry complicate 
its mission to help families most in need. Each 
of the mothers I spoke with—Moore, Hicks, 
Huff, and McKee—shared an anticipation for 
the glory age of 5 when they could finally defer 
to the public school system to receive guaran­
teed state-funded education. Only then will 
they no longer have to strictly budget their 
family finances just to ensure their children are 
cared for. 


After Class
U
ltimately, educators and parents 
alike seem to realize the only way to achieve 
more state and national support—including 
September 2023
saw legal recognition from President Biden as he 
issued an executive order to support affordable 
care and quality jobs for care professionals. The 
work of Goldburn and her colleagues reignited 
within a nationwide effort on March 8, 2023—
International Women’s Day—demanding an 
equitable and just care system. Schiavone said 
that this second effort “solidified us [childcare 
professionals] as workers that could turn out con­
stituents. It brought us together as a community 
in ways we’ve never been connected.” In this sec­
ond wave of rallying, advocates were motivated 
by the residual unfulfilled costs from the previous 
fiscal year and the latest budget report released 
in February which boasted what Goldburn 
described as mere “marginal increases.”

The 2024-2025 state budget added $67.5 mil­
lion to Care 4 Kids, an 11 percent increase since 
the initial forecast which was projected to account 
for seventeen thousand children statewide. But 
there were still 18,384 unenrolled children to be 
accounted for who were left without child care 
upon the forced closures of 11.3 percent of class­
rooms that could not afford to stay open as of 
this past May. So while more money was made 
available to providers amid the withdrawal of fed­
eral COVID-19 relief funding, supply remained 
limited. With fewer openings, families who 
could pay the competitive rates of child care out 
of pocket would take precedence over those who 
could not. Ultimately, the names of the families 
with the least means would be the ones collecting 
dust on the waiting lists.

Change is about turning power over to the 
early childcare workforce, one that has been long 
neglected and underestimated. The Connecticut 
legislature recently passed a bill that would 
push the eligibility for kindergarteners so that a 
third of children born in 2019 would have their 
enrollment delayed into elementary school. The 
educational system skeleton is delicate and dis­
jointed. The additional strain this would place 
on educators and parents speaks volumes about 
who should get to decide the flow of money and 
resources in this industry. Nonetheless, there will 
be educators who show up to their jobs so that 
everyone else can show up for their communities, 
even when it brushes the impossible.

Bermúdez Zimmerman raised the propo­
sition of a flexible spending account, ideated by 
those at the Child Care for Connecticut’s Future 
coalition. In April, Governor Lamont issued an 
executive order to initiate a Blue Ribbon Panel 
on Child Care made up of parents, educators, and 
legislators that would be charged with developing 
a five-year strategic plan for the childcare system. 
The American Rescue Plan is set to issue another 
round of funds for Connecticut’s cities. 

At the time of publication, $10 million is 
slated to be allocated to New Haven’s youth, and 
the city intended to reserve $3 million for child 
care, to be partly administered by Goldburn’s 
advocacy non-profit organization CERCLE, a 
component of Hope for New Haven. 

“This is the beginning of a conversation,” 
Bermúdez Zimmerman told me. 

Establishing some type of trust or giving 
private businesses public features are other ways 
in which people could orient their solution-for­
ward thinking. Bermúdez Zimmerman gave the 
example of a quasi-public structure, which would 
provide private programs with a public mandate 
to deliver their services. Converting money and 
power into the hands of industry professionals 
would make it so that “legislature does not have 
authority to dip their hands into whatever they 
want,” according to Bermúdez Zimmerman. 

Early childhood educators are entrusted with 
the lives of the community’s children daily, they 
should also be entrusted with their financial 
independence.

“I’m more optimistic than I’ve ever been,” 
Bermúdez Zimmerman admits. “The last two 
years have been the most fruitful in getting legis­
lators to pay attention. Things are tough now, but 
we’re doing our work.”  ∎
