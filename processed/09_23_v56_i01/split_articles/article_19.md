EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
But the body is wracked with prob­
lems, and there is a comfort in Bianca’s 
determination that at least some of 
those problems can be solved. 
PCOS, the hormonal condition 
from which Bianca suffers, brings 
a host of frustrating and intractable 
metabolic and fertility problems. But 
its telltale symptom is the growth of 
an above-average amount of face and 
body hair. Because of this, Bianca’s 
own grooming routine includes not 
only frequent self-waxing, but also 
perpetual plucking and even facial 
lasering—a multi-front effort to keep 
her body hair at bay.

Knowing how PCOS works, I can 
understand why Bianca might feel that 
hair is a manifest badness to be excised. 
A thick strand protruding from the skin 
is a weed in a garden—pesky, unwanted, 
and always growing back. This is a feel­
ing I can relate to. Hand me a pair of 
tweezers and I will wage war on a lone 
chin hair. It can feel heroic to purge 
oneself of the brittle, wiry enemy. 
Yes, hair is “natural,” but if you 
think every natural bodily function is 
perfect and good, you probably don’t 
have a period, or thighs that touch. 
Some parts of the female body are bad, 
not because the patriarchy said so, but 
because they hurt, or itch, or feel weird. 
Waxing might be a trap, but so 
is the body. So what if I want to be 
smooth as a seal? 

O
n one rainy day, when it is 
already dark outside, I step into 
Bianca’s apartment, and she greets me 
with a hug. 
The air is musty with stale weed and 
incense. The bottom hems of my pants 
are wet. Bianca’s cat, Boxer, sleeps with 
heaving breath. On the TV, there is 
an animation she sets up for ambiance: 
a table, set al-fresco with coffee mugs, 
doodled lines of steam trailing upward. 
In the corner, a black sandwich board 
bears the inscription “CAFE VIBES.” 
When I get on the table, Bianca 
tries, as always, to give me a good wax, 
quick and painless. She complains 
about the same dude as always, who 
borrowed her car and ran the gas down 
to zero and didn’t refill it. 
When she’s finished, she goes back 
in with tweezers for any rogue hairs she’s 
missed. It’s a series of rapid pricks, and 
each one hurts a different way, a different 
amount. The surprise is the worst part.  
In a few weeks, each hair will 
return, poking to the surface as if to say: 
think again, bitch. 
She smears a last blue strip on my 
lower abdomen. This part I can see—my 
own hip bones rising, my muscles seiz­
ing. My body never gets used to the 
shock of the heat, the fury of the pull. 
She rips it off with abandon. 
“That last one,” she says, “is because 
I love you.” ∎
