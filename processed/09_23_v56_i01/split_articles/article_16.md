Points of Departure
The Witches of 
Whitney
M
y first time between the 
clothing racks at Witch Bitch 
Thrift, I was a stranger at an intimate 
conference on the workings of witch­
hood. A stone cat-owl stared at me 
silently. Galaxy-colored soaps carved 
to resemble human torsos stood nearby, 
bound by lengths of black rope in osten­
sibly kinky ways. I found my reflection 
in a small object, labeled a “scrying 
mirror.” The unfamiliar term unnerved 
me—had I violated some unwritten 
rule by looking directly at it? I turned 
to Wikipedia for some relief: “Scrying, 
also referred to as ‘seeing’ or ‘peeping,’ 
is a practice rooted in divination and 
fortune-telling.” I looked up and saw 
no enlightening vision, but noticed the 
friendly fine print underneath the label: 
“Yep, you can take them off the wall to 
look at them!” I heaved a sigh of relief.


A few days later, I sat and talked 
with Virginia Semeghini and Eva 
Ray, who met in music school in 
Connecticut a few years ago and are 
now life partners who run Witch Bitch 
together. Ray was wearing a black 
t-shirt that said “PLACEBO,” her 
undercut visible beneath a headband 
from which felt coconut trees pro­
truded. Semeghini wore a long dark 
flowy skirt and holographic-framed 
glasses, sporting winged eyeliner and 
pointy nails, too. Together, we traced 
the origin of Witch Bitch Thrift.


One morning in 2020, Semeghini 
was sipping coffee, pinching herself 
awake, when she stopped to muse on 
how she wished an “alternative, cool, 
kind of witchy, kind of queer” sec­
ond-hand clothing store existed. “I was 
just throwing words around my brain, 
being like witch bitch thrift, witch 
bitch thrift...? Wait, that sounds really 
cool.” Immediately, she signed up for as 
many social media handles under Witch 
Bitch Thrift as possible and bought the 
domain for the website. 


In retrospect, Semeghini says that 
her sense of urgency to create Witch 
Bitch Thrift stemmed from her desire 
for both accessibility and aesthetic in 
thrifting. Semeghini remembers hear­
ing lots of “horror stories” from queer 
people about walking into the women’s 
or men’s section in a thrift shop, only for 
a staff member to direct them the other 
way. With Ray and Semeghini also 
struggling to find plus-size clothing in 
mainstream thrift stores like Goodwill 
and The Salvation Army, she decided to 
make Witch Bitch Thrift into a space 
where clothing of all sizes and a wide 
range of aesthetics could be found. 


Witch Bitch Thrift began by selling 
clothes online out of Semeghini and 
Ray’s Bridgeport living room. The busi­
ness then moved into the Bridgeport 
Innovation Center, where it was open 
to the public. After outgrowing the 
space, Witch Bitch Thrift—along with 
Ray and Semeghini—officially moved 
to New Haven in January 2023. Even 
before the big move, Witch Bitch 
Thrift had always been inseparable from 
the city of New Haven. After all, the 
store’s largest customer base came from 
New Haven; Ray and Semeghini’s first 
two dates were in the city; and many 
of their regular customers, friends, and 
collaborators lived nearby. Semeghini 
recalls Ray telling  her, “Well, if we 
want to be a big deal, New Haven’s 
definitely the best place.”


Centuries 
before Witch 
Bitch 
Thrift played its part in furthering 
Connecticut’s fascination with all things 
witchy, witchhood had already capti­
vated the popular imagination. In the 
seventeenth century, national atten­
tion to witchcraft first took form as an 
ostracization of the other, resulting in 
the shunning and killing of suspected 
witches. The mass paranoia surrounding 
the Salem Witch Trials was just as much 
about alienating the atypical as it was a 
fear of witchcraft.


Witch Bitch Thrift sets out to 
serve the witch and the witchy alike. 
Witchcraft, 
broadly 
encompassing 
solitary practitioners and followers 
of religions like Wicca, is part of the 
larger contemporary pagan movement 
based on pre-Christian religions and 
cultures. But beyond spiritual affil­
iation, there has been a rise of the 
witchcore aesthetic online. Witchcore 
reclaims and embraces traditional 
witchhood’s unorthodoxy, with fem­
inine-presenting people wearing all 
black, sporting piercings, and reading 
tarots and crystal balls, expanding tra­
ditional boundaries of femininity and 
organized religion. 


Perhaps the alternative nature of 
witchiness encourages its associations 
with queerness. On TikTok, videos 
under the tag #witchylesbians have 
accrued more than one hundred fif­
ty-two thousand views. Yet, in the popu­
lar imagination, witchiness has remained 
in that same narrow stereotype of 
feminine women in black gowns, or as 
Ray puts it, in the style of “black goth,” 
“something you can get out of Hot 
Topic during Halloween,” and “chains, 
D-rings, studs, heavy makeup.” Though 
this aesthetic may seem hyper-specific 
to some, this does not limit Witch Bitch 
Thrift’s cultivation of an open, queer 
community space. 


When Witch Bitch Thrift first 
started posting on Instagram, Ray and 
Semeghini constantly received com­
ments and direct messages from peo­
ple who thought that their items were 
“not witchy enough,” because most of 
Witch Bitch Thrift’s stock strays from 
all-black clothing. But at Witch Bitch 
Thrift, being witchy is less about meet­
ing a set of criteria and more about 
following one’s own intuition and 
beliefs. To Semeghini, who identi­
fies as a practicing witch, “putting out

transphobic comments on social media. 
If Hogwarts is a demonstration of false 
inclusivity, then Witch Bitch Thrift is 
its antithesis, a place dedicated to being 
a warm and vibrant haven for everyone 
who steps into it.

your moon water” or “performing your 
rituals regularly” only matters if your 
heart’s in it. To Ray, witchiness does 
not come in any defined form for a 
non-follower of specific sects of witch­
craft. “You can be witchy and dress 
like anything, it’s about you...There 
can’t be a box, if you forget there’s four 
walls there.” 


Witch Bitch Thrift is size-inclusive 
and does not categorize its clothes by 
gender. All items that go through the 
shop are hand-measured, then sorted 
into categories clearly delineated on 
their universal size chart, such that cus­
tomers are not confused by the arbitrary 
sizes that different companies label their 
clothes. In an Instagram Reel, Semeghini 
speaks about how, on their online store, 
there are even armhole or thigh hole 
measurements for each garment, as well 
as fabric tags that flag textures like wool 
and velvet for people with sensory sensi­
tivities. She ends with “What else could 
we do to make it easier? Let us know!”


And customers let them know: last 
year, after pushback, the two decided 
against selling Harry Potter merchan­
dise, considering that J.K. Rowling 
had recently come under fire for her 


Nicholas Shamp and William 
Rosedale, regular customers at Witch 
Bitch Thrift, appreciate that the store 
fills the niche of an alcohol-free, homey 
LGBTQ+ friendly space. To them, 
Witch Bitch Thrift is more than just a 
thrift shop; it’s family. Shamp hand-
painted the store mannequins’ nails. He 
also sewed the curtains for the Witch 
Bitch Black Box, which is a commu­
nity space within the store with a mini 
stage and couches. It’s where Ray and 
Semeghini organize events like drag 
king nights, tarot readings, biweekly 
open mic nights, and a series of con­
certs by acoustic queer artists (aptly 
named Acoustiqueer), attracting audi­
ences from New Haven and beyond.


One time at the store, Ray told me 
that she really liked my sweater. On 
the way out, I stopped in front of the 
scrying mirror and saw my reflection. 
I thought about how my sweater was 
plain, white, and frankly uninteresting. 
I looked myself in the eyes—and felt a 
little bit witchy. ∎
