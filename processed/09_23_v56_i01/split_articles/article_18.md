B
ianca Cali has two tips for a 
better, less painful Brazilian wax. 
1. For a wider spread, hang one leg 
over the side of the waxing table. This 
makes it easier to access your crevices. 
2. When the wax comes off, cough 
as loudly as you can. This will distract 
you and force you to exhale. 

She shares these tricks with me 
while my body settles into the waxing 
table. The butcher paper underneath me 
crackles. I rest my head on a pink chil­
dren’s pillow decorated with the felted 
ears and tail of a piglet. 

Bianca produces a bottle of baby 
powder and shakes a bit onto the rele­
vant area. I’m told this will create a pro­
tective layer between the hot wax and 
the skin so that when the wax is pulled 
off, it will only bring hair with it, and 
not stray pieces of epidermis. Between 
the pig pillow, the baby powder, and my 
positioning (pantless, belly-up), I can’t 
help but feel like a giant infant on a 
changing table. 

My wax today will be longer and a 
bit more uncomfortable than it would 
be for a returning client, she explains. 
I have arrived with “four phases of 
hair”—in other words, an unkempt 
bush. Bianca will need to work slowly, 
in small sections. She promises that 
she’ll also give me a break between 
strips. “They never do that at the wax 
centers,” she boasts. 

Bianca shuffles between the waxing 
table and a cart to its right where she 
stores her equipment. She keeps the 
wax in a metal warmer that plugs into 
the wall. The wax is a dazzling royal 
blue that gleams like hard candy. When 
she dips her wooden stick into the pot, 
the wax coils in perfect ribbons around 
the instrument. 

A design flaw of the human body is 
that you can’t really see your own crotch 
when you’re lying down. But when I can 
no longer see Bianca’s wand-wielding 
hand, I start to feel it. Hot. She spreads 
a layer of wax, stickier and thicker than 
honey. The viscous glue hardens on my 
skin, plaster-like. 

“We’re gonna apply all the preeees­
sure. We’re gonna do the bikini line 
fiiiiirst. We’re gonna create that liiiiip,” 
Bianca talk-sings, narrating her process. 
The “liiiiiip” (lip), the raised rim on 
the border of a strip of hard wax, allows 
Bianca to grip and tear away the wax 
when it dries (which takes  three min­
utes, give or take). She flicks the edge of 
the strip, upturning the lip, and grabs 
onto it for traction. Then, in one rapid 
yank, she pulls the wax off, uprooting a 
garden of tiny hairs. Per Bianca’s guid­
ance, I cough as hard as I can, making a 
guttural, throat-clearing noise. 

Bianca peers down at me. 
“Not so bad with the cough, right?” 
she asks.
I blink tears out of my eyes and 
respond: “Totally!” 

Over the course of the next twen­
ty-ish minutes, I undergo this same 
process maybe eighteen times. Wax is 
applied. Wax dries. Bianca flicks. I cough. 
Bianca yanks. We both take a break. 

Because this is a Brazilian wax, 
every hair must go, front and back. She 
coaches me into different positions. 
Legs up. Legs down. Open wider. I 
even lie on my side for a second so she 
can access a hard-to-reach spot. (This is 
something, she tells me, she only ever 
makes Jews and Italians do.) 

It’s not my first time getting a 
Brazilian wax, but it is my first time 
getting a Brazilian wax from someone 
I’ve gotten to know, someone who’s told 
me about her past lovers and her bro­
ken washing machine. The strangeness 
of this dawns on me, opportunely, as 
Bianca is probing her wooden stick into 
my butt crack. I almost laugh out loud.


ianca is a girl’s girl. She’s apt to 
start a text with “Hi bubby” or “Hey 
boo.” She has the mettle to castrate a 
bull, but she’d never cut a bitch. She’s an 
indiscriminate hugger, a serial compli­
ment-giver, and a tried and true friend 
to her friends, her friends’ friends, and 
her friends’ friends’ friends.

She speaks in a high-pitched, syr­
upy East Coast fry. Her pale, heart-
shaped face is dominated by big eyes 
and even bigger glasses that could eas­
ily accoutre a “slutty nerd” Halloween 
costume. She has narrow, groomed 
eyebrows and dark hair. At 32 years 
old, she’s not as thin as she used to be. 
Recently diagnosed with the hormonal 
disorder polycystic ovarian syndrome 
(PCOS), she has gained an estimated 30 
pounds in the past few years. This, she 
maintains, has only made her hotter. 

When she’s waxing, she wears 
leggings and tank tops. And at Stella 
Blues, the jazz club where she sings in 
a monthly variety show, she sports lace 
tights, a black A-line mini dress, and a 
metal headband with cat ears. The ears 
are a nod to vaginas, so often made to 
sound feline. On social media she pro­
motes her waxing business under the 
name “Cali the Kitty Waxer.” 

Bianca lives in a second-floor 
walk-up apartment inside a multi-fam­
ily home on Winchester Avenue in New 
Haven, Connecticut. Her apartment 
doubles as her salon, the workspace cor­
doned off from the living room by a coral 
and gray paisley tapestry. 

Next to the window is a plas­
tic-wrapped pedicure chair with an 
empty foot basin. A pop-up spray tan 
tent leans against the back wall, left fal­
low while her tanning gun awaits repair.
A poster for Ariana Grande’s 2018 
pop album Sweetener hangs on the wall. 
On the original album cover, Grande’s 
head is upside down, descending phan­
tom-like from above. But in Bianca’s 
house, the poster has been rotated. The 
text is flipped, unreadable, and Grande 
is right-side-up.

fiti artist known as La Croix Artistry,

spray-painted a mural on the walls of the 
stairway; it includes a mélange of geo­
metric abstractions, a cartoonish portrait 
of Marilyn Monroe, and a particularly 
yonic crop of pink, petaled flowers. 

If there is a precise border between 
free spirit and hot mess, that’s where 
Bianca lives. A “third shift gal,” she 
regularly sleeps till noon, starting her 
workday as her service-industry clients 
wake up and her Yale student clients get 
out of class. She is constantly effusing 
apologies for petty misdeeds—she’s a 
few minutes late; she missed your call; 
there’s clutter in the living room; she 
just woke up from a nap and forgot to 
put away her bong. 

Most of her clients, I think, like 
this chaos. I certainly do. When the 
one-time director of my college com­
edy group referred me to Bianca, it was 
with the promise of a rollicking time. 
A wax and a performance, like dinner 
and a show.


T
here seems to be an infinity of 
code words for female pubic hair. 
Bush. Fuzz. Forest. Muff. Beaver. 
Landwing strip. Happy trail. Carpet. 
(Does it match the drapes?) Grass on 
the field. (Is there any? Play ball!) The 
language is opaque, positing all kinds 
of bizarre feminine analogues. Woman 
as garden. Woman as airport runway. 
Woman as…baseball diamond? 

It’s no surprise. Even in a post-pussy 
hat world, people still hate vaginas—the 
word “vagina,” images of vaginas. The 
schoolyard game in which children com­
pete to say “penis” the loudest has no 
co-ed counterpart. And even for those 
who can tolerate mention of female geni­
talia, pubes are a bridge too far. 

But most everyone has them.
Pubic hair has a few basic adaptive 
purposes, including regulating body 
temperature, 
retaining 
pheromones, 
and protecting against invisible (but 
apparently very threatening) dirt and 
bacteria. It’s not great to get rid of it, 
but it’s not terrible either. 

Even in the days of yore, women 
groomed their nether parts. Egyptian 
art showcases women with neat trian­
gles of black hair; the edges are rul­
er-straight. Greek statues have hairless 
wedges of crotch between their lush 
marble thighs. These figures speak of 
undiscussed self-mutilations—razoring 
with copper blades, singeing with fire. 

The earliest intimate waxes in the 
modern-day U.S. were bikini waxes, 
which aimed to remove the hairs that 
poked out the sides of a high-cut swim­
suit. This form of waxing emerged in 
the  nineteen-forties as beachwear trends 
skewed skimpier. Navels were exposed, 
cleavage popped, but pubes were a dif­
ferent, less negotiable manner of private 
part. The idea was, and still is, to feign 
ease—to suggest that there was never 
any hair down there to begin with. 

When Hollywood chooses to show 
waxing scenes on-screen, it opts for the 
farcical and slapstick. In an episode of 
Sex and the City credited with popular­
izing the Brazilian wax among its view­
ers, the camera trains its gaze on Carrie 
Bradshaw’s twisted brow. A miscom­
munication leads to more hair removal 
than Bradshaw bargained for, and her 
mouth puckers into sexy shock as her 
stiletto-clad leg remains impossibly 
high in the air. (The double punchline: 
Bradshaw loves her new hairless snatch 
and returns for repeat treatments.) 

Why do we do it? Because it feels…
cleaner? Because it looks…younger? 
These answers seem inescapably misog­
ynistic and perverse. 

I’m not sure why I got my first inti­
mate wax. I was in eighth grade, and I 
was mystified by my own body, always 
searching desperately for cues from 
friends and older women to know what 
was expected. I ambled into my local 
branch of the popular waxing chain 
European Wax Center and asked for 
a clean-up job ahead of a family vaca­
tion. It was terribly painful and not 
very thorough. On my middle school 
allowance, I couldn’t afford the salon’s 
proprietary “ingrown hair serum.” The 
woman at the front desk tried to sched­
ule me for a standing monthly appoint­
ment. Balking at this commitment, I 
didn’t return for years. 

Then, at 17, the arrival of my first 
serious boyfriend brought the topic 
back to the fore. Thorough research 
on the now-defunct website Yahoo 
Answers indicated that all men found 
women’s pubes disgusting. I discovered 
that a lot of my friends had gotten laser 
hair removal, undergoing serial, pain­
ful procedures throughout high school 
to weaken their follicles. It felt like the 
task of managing my grooming was a 
test for which I hadn’t studied. 

I think, optimistically, that the fac­
tors driving women to the waxing table 
are subtler and more varied than mere 
bikinis and boyfriends—a matted tan­
gle of our wishes for ourselves, our anx­
ieties about how our partners will see us, 
our impressions of what kind of women 
we are, some basic sensory preferences. 
These negotiations are usually private 
and often subconscious. 

Yet, no matter how personal and 
intimate our waxing practices are, the 
choice feels inescapably supervised.


A
fter doing her own brows for 
years, Bianca started waxing other 
women in 2008, when she enrolled at 
Central Connecticut State University. 
Just eyebrows at first. She declined for­
mal pay in favor of free drinks at the 
school bar. She loved it. If not for her 
mother’s admonition, Bianca would 
have simply dropped out and pursued 
beauty school. Grudgingly, she finished 
her degree in fine art, then entered 
esthetics training the same year.  This 
was where her waxing repertoire grew 
to include bikini waxes and Brazilians.

The first few professional waxing 
jobs brought frustration. At a men’s 
barber shop, she was stuck in a back 
room and gossiped-about in “really dia­
lect Italian” by the otherwise male staff. 
She eventually realized she was work­
ing for a mafia front, and quit.

Even worse than working for the mob 
was her job at the European Wax Center 
branch in Greenwich, Connecticut. There, 
she waxed rich soccer moms for poor pay. 
“You’d have to wax six vaginas an hour to 
make more than $15,” she estimates. 

When she tells me that she supple­
mented this meager income by working

at a go-go bar in Yonkers, New York, 
I note that this sounds retro and not 
like something they have in Yonkers. 
Quickly, she corrects herself. “It was a 
topless strip club,” she admits. 

The managers of City Lights Strip 
Club originally gave Bianca a position as 
a shot girl—defined on Urban Dictionary 
as a “beautiful woman at the club that is 
too hot to strip, too stupid to bartend.” 
Bianca made good tips but feared she was 
a thorn in the side of the harder-working 
strippers. To really earn her keep, she 
needed to become a dancer herself. 

The more experienced strippers 
at the club taught her how to twerk, 
took her to the Bronx to buy her first 
pair of Pleasers (a type of stripper heel 
favored for its grip), and introduced her 
to a woman named Miss Jamaica who 
sewed luxury brand logos onto whole­
sale leotards. This delighted Bianca, 
who aspired in her youth to be a bur­
lesque dancer, and in her even earlier 
youth to be Liza Minelli.  

As a stripper, she learned to grift 
like never before, traversing the club 
circuit with a dancer from Russia who 
posed as her twin sister: Lana and 
Natasha, they called themselves. “She 
taught me,” says Bianca, “that there is 
always a way to make money.” 

Bianca also quickly realized that 
nobody needed consistent hair removal 
more than strippers. She carved out a 
niche for herself, waxing the dancers at 
her own club and the surrounding ones. 
By the summer of 2015, Bianca had 
something of a monopoly on East Coast 
stripper pubes. Her domain stretched 
from New York to Rhode Island. She 
drove to different cities, rented hotel 
rooms, and waxed the dancers en masse. 

To this day, Bianca maintains that 
strippers are the best clients. They’re 
friendly and appreciative. They tip 
well. They get it. She also believes that 
being a stripper made her a better waxer, 
someone impervious to the garishness 
of naked bodies. She grew comfortable 
enough in her own skin to set others at 
ease in theirs. 

Bianca returned to the compara­
tively dull world of Connecticut salons 
emboldened by the enterprising spirit 
of her stripper days. She started a new 
racket. She took jobs at established 
chains, among them Tommy’s Salon 
and Bluemercury, then poached cli­
ents and began to build her home salon 
between gigs. 

Other than one occasion when she 
was giving a “Manzillian” and acci­
dentally tore off a piece of a client’s 
testicle, Bianca has had remarkably few 
waxing disasters. This is because she is 
a very good waxer. Good enough that 
she could do it in her sleep, she tells me. 
Good enough that she’s done it while 
drunk, she also tells me. 

The best evidence of how good she 
is, however, is that she’s earned the right 
to have fun while she works. She sings, 
and gabs, and monologues, bitching 
about the ex-boyfriend she keeps sleep­
ing with. She’s found that being in an 
exclusive relationship with him makes 
him “protective, and, like, annoying.” 
She still walks his dog.  

A man, to Bianca, is a lot like a dog 
that needs to be walked, or at best, a 
big tipper at the strip club. Her focus is 
on women. She has seen the vaginas of 
moms and mommies, strippers and shot 
girls and sorority sisters. She calls every­
one a “girl,” to their faces and behind 
their backs, whether they are 18  or 80 , 
old friends or new acquaintances. 

Once, as I lay on the waxing table, 
she incanted: “The girls are back. We’re 
all together.” It was just the two of us 
in the room, and I was confused by the 
plurality, girls, and I didn’t know where 
we were back from. Still, I liked the 
ring of it: 
The girls are back. We’re all together. 

Bianca gives the best wax I’ve ever 
had. She’s the fastest and the thor­
ough-est, and the most adept at loos­
ening the grip of my self-consciousness. 
“Naked is naked,” she says of the pre­
sumed awkwardness of her job. “Fluid 
is fluid.” She’s seen it all, and it’s all 
more alike than different. 

At 21 years old, I’ve now had more 
Brazilian waxes than I can count. But 
I still feel a childlike ineptitude every 
time I get waxed. My hastily-folded 
underwear, dropped on some chair 
beside the waxing table, looks incon­
gruous, ratty, juvenile. My legs are 
hideous on the table—wide and veiny 
and gray, with their own crop of sud­
denly-obvious stubble. I wonder: Is my 
body the worst, weirdest body that this 
waxer has ever seen? 

But still, I am fearful from the 
first strip to the last, not because I’m 
scared it will hurt—hell, I know it will 
hurt—but because, even though all I 
have to do is lie there, I feel like I’m 
doing it wrong.


O
n a few occasions, I try to bait 
Bianca into confessing that she 
sees what’s problematic in the whole 
ordeal. I expect she might say that she 
knows waxing is a patriarchal con, but 
she’s learned to profit from it like a 
sleazy girlboss. 

I say, “I wish they’d invent an easier 
way of doing this.” 
She says, “This is pretty easy.” 

I tell her that some of my friends 
from college are “rockin’ full bush.” 
“We gotta tell them,” she says, as she 
begins to scheme for a punch-card system. 

I ask her why she thinks people 
get waxed. 
“I feel like it takes half your life to 
shave your body.”

Eventually, I stop trying to force 
this concession. I know that fork­
ing over $80  to get all my pubic hair 
painfully pulled off is a transaction in 
a rigged economy whose two curren­
cies are money and hotness. I know 
it’s something men don’t have to do, 
something I shouldn’t—and really 
don’t—have to do.
