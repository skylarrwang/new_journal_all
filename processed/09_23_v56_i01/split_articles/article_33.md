The caldera of the volcano Ijen is 
faded gray and completely silent. The sul­
fur gas keeps out all animal life—no birds, 
no insects, no rodents. The gas is yellow 
where it breathes from the ground, gray-
white as it rises into puffy clouds at the 
rim of the crater. Tourists watch the sun 
rise over the backs of men carrying the 
sulfur up from below.

When the men cough, their racking 
breaths are dampened by the thick air. They 
are Javanese men no older than fifty, and 
their backs are calloused from the bas­
ket-pole. The full baskets weigh as much as 
ninety kilograms, much more than the men 
carrying them. The trail is steep and rocky. 
From the rim of the crater, the men 
wheel carts of sulfur down the rutted trail, 
hundreds of kilograms at a time, to the 
processing plant at the base of the moun­
tain. At a weigh station near the volcano, 
processing facility PT. Candi Ngrimda 
pays the men by the weight of their harvest. 
Most make about three times the region’s 
average wage. They work from midnight 
until almost 2 p.m. 

In the cool night air, the sulfur con­
denses into liquid, then hardens solid. 
Pipes concentrate the gasses, speeding up 
the accumulation of hardened rocks. The 
fresh sulfur is bright yellow. The locals 
call it the devil’s gold, named for the price 
paid by the men who extract it. Sulfur is 
used for explosives, match heads, elec­
tronic components, and beauty products. 
But PT. Candi Ngrimba uses the sulfur 
here, mined from Ijen, to whiten the sugar 
grown in the region.
