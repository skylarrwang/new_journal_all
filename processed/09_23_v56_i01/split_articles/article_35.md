Midtown to make it on time to a dinner 
reservation. I love hearing their snippets 
of conversation. I love judging their out­
fits and haircuts and modes of walking. I 
love the old ladies selling beaded brace­
lets in Washington Square Park and the 
guys stationed next to them with their 
skateboards and overgrown hair. I love 
Koreatown at night, because the restau­rants are open twenty-four hours and 
the soup tastes better when the sky is 
pitch black and the air has cooled and 
no one is checking the time. 


Some of my friends who are not 
from New York are here for the summer, 
and they’ve come to two conclusions. 
One is that going for a walk feels like 
enough of an activity to deem an entire 
day productive. The other is that it feels 
quite small for a place with a popula­
tion of eight million. Yesterday, I ran 
into three people I know in one hour. It 
made no sense.

I 
passed my driver’s test five days 
before my flight. In real life, I am sur­
prised to learn that the cars drive very 
fast and ignore the stop signs. They don’t 
signal before they switch lanes; they 
expect others will make room. 


The first official “highway” I drive 
on is South Coast, through the main 
downtown strip. There is a theater on 
the left side called Star that looks like 
it has been extracted out of a nine­
teen-fifties Hollywood set to an unas­
suming beach locale on the coast of 
Southern California. A neon sign juts 
out from the building and projects the 
light of multicolored stars onto the road. 
My friend grew up performing in Star 
productions. One of his peers became 
a Disney celebrity and moved an hour 
and a half north to Los Angeles. He 
tells me how weird it is for a childhood 
friendship to become a parasocial one, 
where only one party knows what the 
other is up to. It’s so strange to see his 
face, he says, on the internet, or to hear 
the songs he inspired playing on the 
radio. He tries to avoid it. 


The city of Oceanside, population 
173,000, could have been written for 
a screenplay. It is a year-round sum­
mer vacation. The streets are named 
Surfrider, 
Sportfisher, 
Seagaze. 
At 
night, a line slinks around the block for 
a local ice cream shop that serves their 
scoops out of six windows. They have 
fifty flavors and no samples, so I blindly 
choose vanilla caramel brownie. It is 
surprisingly stretchy, rich and sweet and 
delightfully ordinary.


everything. “After Covid,” she sighs, “it’s 
like people have no heart.”


My mother has become frightened 
by the violence on the news and warns 
me against taking the train. I resist, cit­
ing my solo rides at 10 years old, to and 
from school. I have the cadence of the 
6 train memorized, the names of the 
stops and the minutes between each one. 
I love the choreography it requires, of 
overlapping arms, absence of eye contact, 
the collective squeeze to let one more 
person in. There have been several occa­
sions when a friend has stepped into the 
same car as me, and we are both startled 
and completely unsurprised that such a 
coincidence could happen.


On June 6, a pale yellow haze covers 
the sky, diffusing the setting sun on my 
evening walk around the reservoir. My 
friend texts me that it is coming from 
the wildfires in Canada. I tell him how 
beautiful it looks in person, forgetting the 
burning trees. The next day, I wear a mask 
for the first time in two years, and it is 
scratchy and unfamiliar. It is almost as if 
the pandemic was a dream—a tear in a 
film reel, taped up and smoothed out.        


What I miss most about New York 
when I am gone are the people who 
don’t look at me funny when I pull 
out my camera or wear my pajamas to 
the park or run sixty blocks through 


After I get home from work and 
cook dinner, I have thirty minutes of 
sunlight before it gets dark. I slip on 
my running shoes and jog to the water, 
where there are families and couples and 
teenage boys in snapbacks and tourists 
with fanny packs scattered along the 
pier. Spectators lean against the railing, 
studying the surfers mounting the baby 
waves, upright for seconds before they 
fall off their boards and sink beneath the 
surface. I think about how cold they are. 
If they know everyone is watching them.


At the start of the pier, there is a man 
selling churros from a cart with a vat of 
bubbling, golden oil. At the end, there 
are fishermen stationed in a semicircle 
with prawns and tiny sea creatures tied 
around their thin fishing rods. I shuf­
fle past them quickly. I’m not sure why 
their presence intimidates me. Perhaps 
it is because I feel like an intruder on 
their nightly ritual, or because I inter­
pret their silent focus as a threat. As the 
line separating the sky and the ocean 
fades into obscurity, I think about how 
all the Infinity Rooms I’ve stood inside 
at fancy museums pale in comparison to 
the real thing, the sparkles on the black­
ened sea, the eternity it suggests.


I walk home in the half light.


There is a hurricane warning on my 
second-to-last day in Oceanside. My 
mother calls and instructs me to buy 
toilet paper and nonperishables. The 
downpour is steady and pools into the 
crevices on the patio. I stay inside all day, 
watching the rain through the window, 
and I am miserable. In the morning, the 
city is damp, but the sun is out again 
and I realize how tan I’ve become from 
forgetting to put on sunscreen. How my 
heart rate has slowed with the assurance 
that every day will be the same. I will go 
to the water. I will not know anyone’s 
name. ∎
