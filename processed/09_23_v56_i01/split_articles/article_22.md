Throughout her decades-long career, 
Georgia Goldburn vowed never to close 
the doors of her childhood development 
center. Goldburn, Executive Director of Hope 
for New Haven and a child care industry vet­
eran, was determined to run her programming—
despite tens of thousands of dollars worth of 
debt, high staff turnover, and overall financial 
instability. After navigating the risks of oper­
ating through COVID-19, Goldburn reviewed 
her business’s 2022 finances. She realized the 
sum she could afford to pay her teachers was 
less than the amount they would receive from 
unemployment benefits.


Goldburn’s motivations to operate exceed 
a financial bottom line. They have to. Goldburn 
has committed herself to providing early child­
hood education to Black and brown communities. 
She has observed firsthand how a lack of targeted 
childhood support services, insufficient teacher 
compensation, and inaccessibility of high-quality 
educational programs influences outcomes in the 
community she calls home.


Goldburn’s program Hope for New Haven 
centers under-resourced communities of color. 
Her mission is to consolidate educational 
resources for minority groups emerging from 
her community. 
“What we want is for people of color to 
still have those connections without having to 
leave a community to achieve economic success,” 
Goldburn told me. She emphasized that it is not 
enough to haplessly invest money into under­
served populations without being conscious about 
keeping those groups connected.


“You have to be intentional in how you bring 
money into child care,” she said. 
The system of reallocation is not always 
an equitable one. According to Eva Bermúdez 
Zimmerman, Coalition Director of Child Care 
for Connecticut’s Future, the state’s solution for 
early education is a general stabilization fund 
for licensed child care programs, leaving every­
one haggling. Subsequently, the investment can 
bypass communities most in need and manifest in 
short-sighted solutions, such as inserting children 
into affluent neighborhoods rather than fortify­
ing their local resources. 


Before 2021, universal early child care in 
Connecticut was unheard of until the formation 
of Child Care for Connecticut’s Future, a coalition 
with campaign goals of securing fair compensation 
for educators and more affordable child care for all.


Providers, who range from close relatives tak­
ing care of children to those working at childcare 
centers like Goldburn, understand that when 
they show up to their jobs, parents can show 
up for theirs. The effect bolsters the economy 
and the broader state community. As Executive 
Director of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute, 
Dr. Walter Gilliam quips: “Child care is like the 
road…if it doesn’t work, you can’t get to work.”


But nationwide, legislators and policymakers 
do not treat early childhood care as a fully subsi­
dized public good. Unlike kindergarten through 
high school, early childhood education does not 
fall under the funding and discretion of a stan­
dardized public school system. The closest thing 
Connecticut has to a universal early child care 
system is its twenty-two Head Start programs, 
state-subsidized 
school 
readiness 
preschool 
programs that serve more than 5,539 children 
and families. But these programs often contain 
waitlists of over a hundred families and struggle 
to employ qualified teachers. The local govern­
ment’s other stopgap—a program called “Care 4 
Kids” that subsidizes the cost of child care from 
a wide range of providers—can prove inadequate 
or simply too obscure. Parents and educators alike 
are thus primarily left to navigate a complicated 
patchwork of funding, care options, and availabil­
ity alone—with plenty of barriers to access. 


Every dollar spent on child care, 
Gilliam noted, yields $7.30 in “society savings.” 
These savings represent the money gained back 
when a child has a safe educational environment, 
the chance to secure their degree and employment, 
and ultimately the tools to become a produc­
tive citizen. According to the Early Childhood 
Alliance, the first one thousand days of life is the 
most significant time for secure attachment and 
brain development. Goldburn noted that 80 to 90 
percent of a child’s brain has already developed by 
the time they are 4 and 5 years old. For this reason, 
early childhood educators are pivotal in nurturing 
those basic, life-altering skills that are underesti­
mated yet critical.


Despite the need for these crucial skills, pol­
icymakers and lobbyists alike often neglect to 
fund early childhood education. This is perplexing 
because, as Gilliam notes: “Anytime something is 
considered an infrastructure and essential to life 
and the general public can’t afford it, the govern­
ment subsidizes it.” If that were the case, early 
childhood education should have been queued 
years ago.


“If someone isn’t gonna get rich off of it, [a 
bill] might not pass,” Gilliam told me. He noted 
that to pass a policy funding early child care, the 
proposal must characterize the care as necessary 
to other things constituents care about, namely 
their own assets. While child care buttresses 
familial life, business often takes precedence.


Early childhood education, then, presents a 
difficult business model. Many childcare centers 
struggle to generate revenue and fairly compen­
sate staff, incentivizing fewer people to join the 
field. A third of programs operate in debt, and 71.8 
percent are short-staffed. Providers and parents 
across Connecticut, particularly those who belong 
to and serve marginalized populations, are often 
forced to make decisions in a broken, contradic­
tory market. 


In the spring of 2022, the median wage of 
a childcare professional was $14.97 per hour, 
hardly exceeding the state minimum wage of $14 
at the time. Many of these professionals have 
earned their associate’s and bachelor’s degrees, 
and yet they are compensated like entry-level 
workers. Bermúdez Zimmerman told me that 
both locally and nationally, solutions for recov­
ering the funding deficit are still in the early 
stages. While there are state-subsidized read­
iness programs, they struggle to employ and 
retain qualified staff members. 


“It’s a rotating door, it’s not sustainable,” 
Bermúdez Zimmerman said. Educators seek 
security amidst a shortage of qualified staff, 
the backbone but most challenging aspect of 
the industry.


Devonna Lewis, who currently teaches at a 
New Haven public school pre-kindergarten pro­
gram, experienced the impact of this pay firsthand. 
Lewis began her career in early education at a 
private center. At the time, she was a 24-year-old 
single mother seeking child care for her daughter. 
Now, decades later, even after receiving her asso­
ciate’s degree, little has changed as far as finan­
cial insecurity in the industry. Lewis told me that 
there is no way to win—either hardly subsist on 
minimum wage or make $10 beyond the thresh­
old and lose out on food stamps, healthcare, and 
other government assistance covered under state 
general financial assistance programs. 


Yet while childcare professionals struggle to 
make ends meet, infant care in Connecticut is 
still prohibitively expensive—25.5 percent more 
per year than in-state tuition for a four-year pub­
lic college. According to Goldburn, educators 
mostly use revenue for technical maintenance 
like fixing licensing issues, facility repairs, and 
citations. Despite the need for these programs, 
many childhood educators are struggling to 
swim in a market of contradictions—a highly 
competitive landscape with three thousand, eight 
hundred staff vacancies and an essential service 
barely treading water. The money parents pay is 
not streaming into teachers’ pockets; rather, it is 
financing overhead costs.


Lottie Brown, another New Haven-based 
childcare provider, runs her decade-old business 
out of her home, a completely baby-proofed 
facility with a colorful array of puz­
zles, art supplies, and occupied gar­
dening trays. In Brown’s experience 
working in her own business and 
the New Haven public school sys­
tem, classrooms serve as safe havens 
for young children. According to 
Brown, some of these children were 
born surrounded by drug usage—3-
year-olds have come into Brown’s care 
cursing and sporting “drug parapher­
nalia.” “What happens to that child 
who found her mother unresponsive?” 
Brown asked. Her experience with 
children who have been brought up in 
unsafe circumstances propelled her to 
step in as a childcare professional.


Developing and operating an early 
childcare program requires a level of 
attention and care that far transcends 
the glorified babysitter stigma—that 
the extent of the job is merely mon­
itoring children. Early childhood 
educators find themselves preparing 
both academic and emotional toolkits. 
To help build their confidence and 
self-esteem, Brown encourages her 
students to engage with one another 
and their surroundings. 


“Children need structure, but they 
also need opportunities to learn with­
out teacher-directed things,” Brown 
told me. Purging her program of digi­
tal devices, teaching her students how 
to garden, and helping them pick up a 
paintbrush all allow the children under 
Brown’s care to advance lifelong skills.


But a solid curriculum is not 
enough for a program to thrive, 
according to Goldburn. The program 
has to be marketable. Improving 
retention rates and appealing to wealthy patrons 
means that her program and many others must 
spend their income to comply with industry 
standards and bring in quality resources. When 
facilities are struggling to meet those expecta­
tions, Brown reflects, licensing divisions and 
families alike may perceive the program to be 
lower in quality. Yet centers can only work within 
their means. Less than a third of childcare cen­
ters in Connecticut report a positive cash flow. 
Without the money to afford expensive facil­
ities and equipment, childcare programs must try 
to circumvent whatever judgment that might be 
easy for onlookers to pass. “All people are left with 
is what they see,” Goldburn said. And what many 
see are centers that are providing high-quality care 
without high-quality resources. Achieving such 
standards has a price tag, namely, the enormous 
wage penalty paid by early childhood educators. It is 
a financial burden taken on primarily by women of 
color—whose labor is underpaid and undervalued. 


“Had it been a male-dominated 
industry, would we be facing the same 
challenges?” Anna Witkowski, Chief 
Education Officer for the Children’s 
Learning Centers of Fairfield County, 
asked me pointedly. Out of her one 
hundred forty employees, two are 
men. A previous male employee left 
to work at a Target, which paid $27 an 
hour compared to the $17.50 he made 
hourly as an early childhood educator. 


In an industry sustained by 
women—who comprise about 94 
percent of childcare workers—these 
professionals struggle to disband 
the notions of glorified babysitting 
and passivity often associated with 
their jobs.


Friends Center for Children 
Executive Director Allyx Schiavone 
explained that the societal denigra­
tion of contemporary early childhood 
educators exists within a history of 
exploitation. She urges us to con­
front a parallel reality: “The child­
care system was born out of slavery.” 
Throughout 
antebellum 
America, 
Black enslaved women cared for 
the children of white slave own­
ers. Modern disparities in education 
staffing and access embody the legacy 
of centuries worth of subjugation. 


“When we become so habituated 
to neglecting and exploiting a group,” 
Gilliam explained, “it becomes easier 
to not think about them at all.” 
Disregarding the experiences and 
histories of women of color perpetu­
ates a childcare system that exploits 
their labor. Goldburn confirmed that 
the financial struggles experienced by 
childcare industry professionals are most acute in 
marginalized communities. Black early educators 
are paid on average $0.78 less per hour than their 
white peers, which adds up to more than one 
thousand dollars lost annually.


Connecticut provides a state-subsidized 
childcare program—Care 4 Kids—to fami­
lies with an income of less than 60 percent of the 
state median income. It is the only subsidy-based 
childcare program in the state of its kind in that 
it supports independent providers. And while 
many families benefit greatly from the financial 
assistance, most still have to make partial pay­
ments, upwards of 30 percent of their income, to 
keep their children enrolled in child care. 


According to the state’s plan for the fed­
eral Child Care and Development Fund, Care 
4 Kids reimbursed 52 percent of the market rate 
for infant and toddler care and 30 percent of 
that for preschoolers. A discrepancy between 
the true cost of child care and what providers 
receive leaves parents struggling to pay the dif­
ference on their own. This divide—coupled with 
slow processing time and a lack of easily available 
knowledge—limits Care 4 Kids’ ability to fully 
aid Connecticut parents.


The Care 4 Kids website defines childcare 
providers as early childhood centers licensed by 
the Connecticut Office of Early Childhood or 
a close relative designated to watch over a child. 
Care 4 Kids sends a Child Care Certificate to 
admitted applicants, which authorizes pay­
ment for services for up to a year. Families must 
undergo an annual redetermination process to 
reaffirm their eligibility for the program.


Throughout the final months of 2022, Care 
4 Kids covered a considerable portion of New 
Haven mom Christina Moore’s childcare fees. 
Like the families of more than twenty-five 
thousand other children enrolled in Care 4 Kids, 
Moore met an income limit of less than 60 per­
cent of the State Median Income. She needed a 
daycare to supplement her efforts to support her 
son’s learning while she worked full-time. With 
the promise of these subsidies, Moore enrolled 
her 2-year-old son in daycare. 


But even with the state aid, her son’s child 
care placed an increasingly heavy financial burden 
on her family. Due to a marginal increase in her 
income, Moore had to pay a “family fee”—an out-
of-pocket cost based on her gross income—to 
keep her son enrolled in daycare when he turned 
3. As Care 4 Kids withdrew part of their financial 
assistance, Moore started sending her son to day­
care two days a week instead of five. She had to 
adjust her work schedule to accommodate her son 
being home. 


Moore moved her son into another pre-kin­
dergarten readiness program this past year. But 
the new center had not been inspected. Childcare 
centers in Connecticut are expected to undergo 
state-mandated health and safety inspections, 
including training requirements in CPR, medi­
cation administration, and other forms of emer­
gency preparedness. But centers are expected to 
front the cost of inspection—a cost that some 
cannot afford. 


If Moore had been forced to foot the bill while 
seeking Care 4 Kids coverage, she would have had 
to sacrifice a third of her mortgage in the name of 
keeping her son enrolled in daycare.
