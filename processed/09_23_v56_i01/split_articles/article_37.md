EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Every day since I arrived in Paris, I have gone 
to the same bookstore,the one next to the Panthéon. 
I’m convinced it’s where I’m going to find god. 
The tables outside are a forgettable shade of beige. 
When I settle into them, the waitress says “Hello” 
before I can greet her with “Bonjour.” I counter her 
judgment by placing a book entitled La Plaisanterie 
on the table. I wonder if this feeling of humiliation 
is god. 

Every day I don’t spend crying in Paris is 
another day I’m convinced I’m missing the point. 
God, if you’re there, help me cry. Help me look at 
the royal purple doors of Place Sainte-Geneviève 
and etch them into my memory with tears. Defeated, 
I walk up to the cashier and ask to buy their last 
slice of cake. I spent the prior 30 seconds believing 
that the cake was as lonely and confused as me. But, 
perhaps the cake is just cake and the doors are just 
doors. She refused to let me pay. 

The silence of the bathroom doused me in 
forgiveness. There was no pressure to comprehend 
Paris’ consequential essence, nor pressure to feel my 
subsequent inconsequentiality. I ate the cake with 
my bare hands. Looking in the mirror, I started to cry. 
Not because god finally bestowed unto me the secret 
of  living with purpose, but because I was eating cake 
in the bathroom. What kind of person eats cake in the 
bathroom? 

A knock on the door. I remember how inconve­
nient it is to have revelations when the practicalities 
of life still exist. 

Walking away, I remembered the half-eaten cake 
that remained on the counter. I never went back to the 
bookstore again.
