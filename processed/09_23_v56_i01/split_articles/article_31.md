The Debate for Dignity
meet, I’m intimidated by her incisive, no-frills 
demeanor—she’s 
terrifyingly 
articulate 
and 
emails without exclamation points. Throughout 
our meeting, though, I find myself warming up to 
her vulnerability and occasional jokes.
Joan is one of the founding members of 
Progressives Against Medical Assisted Suicide 
(PAMAS), a Connecticut-based grassroots orga­
nization fighting SB 1076 and variations of the bill 
that have come before it. PAMAS opposes aid in 
dying on the basis that its legalization would inev­
itably lead to its weaponization against economi­
cally, socially, and racially marginalized individuals. 
It, along with other organizations, has been 
fighting to “provide a path for leftists and pro­
gressives who have social justice concerns” about 
aid in dying and to disrupt the notion that the 
opposition is exclusively religious and conserva­
tive. According to Joan, national conversations 
surrounding aid in dying legalization have been 
curated by large organizations like Compassion 
& Choices as a fight for bodily autonomy against 
religious conservatism—“The main funder of 
the opposition is the leadership of the Catholic 
Church,” Tim emphasized in our conversation—
leaving out progressive oppositional concerns. 
“The narrative that suggests that it’s only reli­
gious conservatives or right-wing Republicans 
who are against [aid in dying] really serves 
Compassion & Choices and other groups who are 
pushing this. They love it,” Joan says. 
Joan started organizing after witnessing the 
way her mother, “an elderly dementia patient who 
was on Medicare and Medicaid,” was treated by 
the “medical industrial complex,” the network of 
corporate powers—hospitals, hospice care pro­
grams, drug companies, pharmacies, insurance 
companies, etc.—that form the health industry.
In September of 2011,  Joan’s mother was 
admitted to the Yale New Haven Hospital after 
she began regularly aspirating and had trouble 
swallowing. Up until January of 2012, Joan stayed 
in the hospital with her mom every night and was 
“constantly assaulted by doctors saying, you need to 
let her go, you should send her off to hospice.” At 
the same time, however, Joan’s mother was telling 
her that she “wasn’t ready to die.”
Eventually, her mother’s private doctor told 
Joan that her mother needed a tracheostomy for 
her breathing. However, when Joan made the 
request,  someone—“I think it was a nurse [but] 
I’m not sure. I never learned the identity of the 
person”—summoned an ethics committee meet­
ing, where doctors discussed overriding Joan’s 
decision to continue her mother’s treatment. Joan 
attributes the hospital’s reluctance to continue 
treating her mother to financial disincentives, 
among other reasons.
“Medicare and Medicaid do not pay the hos­
pital what they want for these long hospitaliza­
tions,” Joan tells me. 
Historically, both Medicare and Medicaid 
have underpaid hospitals in reimbursement 
funds—only “56 percent of the amount that 
private insurers pay,” according to a Heritage 
Foundation report. According to another report

published by the Commonwealth Fund, a pri­
vate foundation that supports research in health­
care issues, the two health insurance programs 
underpaid hospitals by $24.8 billion in 2020 and, 
according to the American Hospital Association, 
by $76.8 billion in 2017. 
Seeing how willing the “medical industrial 
complex” was to end her mother’s access to cura­
tive care spurred Joan to think about the ways that 
legalizing aid in dying would impact vulnerable 
populations such as those who are low-income, 
disabled, terminally-ill, and individuals of color. 
“We live in a system where severely disabled 
people, elderly, poor, and non-white people are 
devalued,” Joan says. “There’s already a lot of 
incentive for insurance companies to go for the 
cheapest option of treatment.”
Joan posits that if aid in dying were to be 
legalized, hospitals would press patients away 
from curative care and into the option of aid in 
dying to cut costs, especially in the case of low-in­
come individuals on Medicaid or Medicare. 
The 1977 Washington v. Glucksberg Supreme 
Court decision also noted this potential financial 
incentive, stating “if physician-assisted suicide 
were permitted, many might resort to it to spare 
their families the substantial financial burden of 
end-of-life health care costs.”
Joan said that the corporate profit incentive, 
along with more circumstantial and covert pres­
sures—familial finances, low-quality palliative care, 
and ableism—all lead to a reality where marginal­
ized groups can be coerced into aid in dying.  She 
also believes that the failure of general hospice 
and of palliative care is also contributing to the 
demand for assisted suicide. 
“I heard one person speak about [supporting 
assisted suicide] and she was talking about how 
hospice had failed them and it’s clicking for me…
the failure of hospice care is propelling her to sup­
port medical assisted suicide,” she said. 
In November 2022, The New Yorker pub­
lished an investigative piece capturing how hos­
pice care was turning into a “for-profit hustle.” 
According to Connecticut Hospice, a non-profit 
hospice in the state and “America’s first hospice,” 
to qualify for hospice care, patients must be 
certified by two physicians, who can verify that 
they are terminally ill with a prognosis of six 
months or less to live and formally give up cura­
tive care. This is the standard for the majority of 
hospices around the nation. However, The New 
Yorker found that a growing number of for-profit 
hospice programs would “dupe people into the 
program by claiming that it’s free home health 
care,” illegally recruiting patients who aren’t 
actually terminally ill and keeping them from 
accessing curative care. Patients who outlived 
the projected hospice average of six months for 
profit were then “dumped” by companies. These 
exploitative practices have made hospices espe­
cially predatory toward low-income individuals. 
Disability Rights Opposition
A
ccording to Cathy Ludlum, a disability 
rights activist, there is a long history of the 
medical industrial complex turning to assisted 
suicide to avoid accountability for bettering pal­
liative care for terminally ill and disabled individ­
uals. Cathy, a longtime Manchester, CT resident, 
founded Second Thoughts Connecticut, a disabil­
ity rights organization fighting against the state 
legalization of aid in dying.

After a few back and forth emails, the two 
of us finally hop on a video call together. Cathy 
uses a wheelchair and joins our conversation clad 
in thin-rimmed glasses and a toothy grin. In the 
middle of exchanging introductions, Cathy turns 
from the Zoom camera and directs her voice 
towards her computer.
“Computer, wake up. Mouse click. Mouse 
5…674.” 
Refined by years of practice, Cathy navigates 
her computer exclusively using voice commands. 
When I ask Cathy how she started organizing 
against medical aid in dying, she jumps in and 
asks me to use the term “assisted suicide” instead. 
“Medical aid in dying as a term, really, is 
misleading,” Cathy says. “If someone is assisting 
someone in their transition [to death], that would 
be hospice—assisting the person to be comfort­
able in their health, alleviating anxiety, existential 
concerns, and clinical concerns.”
Cathy tells me that there’s significant histori­
cal precedent for medical abuse of assisted suicide. 
She points to the case of Larry McAfee as an 
example. In 1989, Larry McAfee, who was para­
plegic and frustrated with the limitations of his 
life, won court permission to have his ventilator 
disconnected. Despite his initial decision, McAfee 
changed his mind after moving to a nursing home 
that contained specific accommodations for his 
disability, such as a special computer that let him 
contact the outside world. McAfee ended up living 
for six more years, until he passed from pneumonia.
According to Cathy, McAfee’s case illumi­
nated a jarring conclusion: assisted suicide can 
often be a last resort that disabled individuals are 
cornered into because society lacks the proper 
accommodations—whether that’s access to tech­
nology, medicine, or caretakers—to guarantee 
them proper care and fulfilling lives. . 
I look at Cathy, who’s sitting in her wheel­
chair, and her implicit argument becomes clear: If 
assisted suicide is legalized, my life and right to live 
become at risk.
Compared to other state bills that have 
been passed, Connecticut’s proposed legislation, 
with its stringent residential requirement and 
older age limit—21, instead of 18 like many other 
states—seems to be on the tighter end of aid in 
dying legislation.
But when I ask Cathy and Joan whether the 
safeguards of SB 1076—including a physician 
“We live in a 
system where 
severely disabled 
people, elderly, 
poor, and non-
white people are 
devalued,” Joan 
says.
confirmation of terminal illness, a present witness 
who has no stake in the patient’s death, the patient 
needing to be sound of mind—would mitigate 
some of the aforementioned inequities, they pre­
sented a list of refutations. First, regulations can’t 
prevent covert pressure like familial pressure or a 
patient’s internal guilt for feeling like a burden. 
Second, even places like Oregon, which has legal­
ized aid in dying for twenty-five years, admit to 
not having enough resources to oversee individual 
cases of aid in dying to check for physician negli­
gence or coercion. Lastly, even if all the checks did 
initially work, Cathy argues through the cases of 
Oregon and Vermont, that pro-aid in dying lob­
byists will often use the “bait and switch” tactic 
to wear down legislative safeguards over time. For 
instance, aid in dying was originally legalized in 
Vermont in 2013 under a stipulation that it could 
only be used by residents. However, in May, after 
a lawsuit filed by a Connecticut woman seeking 
aid in dying found Vermont’s residency require­
ments unconstitutional, the Vermont governor 
removed residency requirements. Oregon, which 
had passed its Death With Dignity Act with a 
residency requirement in 1997, also repealed its 
own in 2022. 
In essence, according to Joan and Cathy, it 
doesn’t matter which guardrails were initially set 
with legalizing aid in dying, because there’s noth­
ing stopping them from being worn down.
Despite the aid in dying clash’s emotional 
charge, its intricacies, and its interside tensions, 
Joan says that she has still found moments of 
humanity in connecting with the other side. 
Once, after a bill hearing, Joan had the chance 
to talk to a woman testifying in support of aid 
in dying, who had lost her wife to a “very, very 
drawn-out death.” Moved by the woman’s story, 
Joan shared her mother’s story. 
“I said [to her] you know, we are not against 
you folks, and I really understand what it’s like to 
lose somebody you love, very, very painfully,” she 
said. “We have that same thing in common. I’ve 
been there. I know what it feels like.”
When Palliative Care Isn’t Enough
W
hen I meet Tyrone Biniarz, I’m greeted 
by a man in his late fifties, with a full white 
beard and deep-set voice. Tyrone—who tells me 
to call him Ty—is from Ellington, CT and carries 
himself with a frank yet warm air. Throughout the 
interview, he constantly reminds me: “I’m a very 
open person. I don’t mind you asking anything 
that maybe you don’t feel comfortable asking.”
In April 2016, Ty’s brother Clifford, at the time 
49 years old and living in Tucson, was diagnosed 
with chondrosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. After 
complications with an initial surgery, Clifford was 
hospitalized in Houston for nine months. He 
could no longer walk on his own and lost “bowel 
function and control of his bladder.” Unable to live 
alone, Clifford moved in with Tyrone and his fam­
ily in Connecticut in May 2017.
Before the cancer diagnosis, Clifford had been 
very active. The two brothers loved hiking the 
Grand Canyon “rim to rim in one hike” and going 
to the Indy 500 race together. However, by the 
time he moved in to Ty’s, Clifford couldn’t walk 
up a flight of stairs without assistance.
To get Clifford to his bed on the second floor 
of his home, Ty would secure a strap around his 
chest to “pull and support” his brother as he used 
a walker up the stairs. Despite receiving care from 
Ty and his family, Clifford’s mobility, agency, and 
life all changed irrevocably. 
Since Clifford wasn’t yet a Connecticut resi­
dent or on disability, there were a lot of services he 
didn’t qualify for yet. So Ty, who was at the time 
working a full-time job, became Clifford’s full-
time caretaker.
Ty learned how to take care of and clean 
Clifford the way a nurse would. He tended to 
his brother in the mornings, during his lunch 
break, when he’d drive home from work, and in 
the evenings. 
“I had two kids so it was [similar] to chang­
ing a baby’s diaper. But the circumstances are very 
different because it’s my own brother and he’s an 
adult, right,” Ty says. “So that was difficult.”
Though Ty was happy to help his brother out, 
the dynamic took “its toll financially”—and men­
tally. Ty went “heavily into debt” over Clifford’s 
medical bills. And in February 2021, Ty suffered a 
heart attack. 
“It’s not that I had a heart attack because of 
him,” Ty says. “But the stress and everything in the 
years leading up to that… I’m sure they were con­
tributing factors.”
During the time period leading up to 
Clifford’s death, Ty says that Clifford had been 
contemplating ways to commit suicide, because 
he didn’t want to “go the way [their mother] 
who had cancer did.” Ty knew that Clifford was 
communicating back and forth with someone 
who had access to Canadian medications. He’d 
contemplated hoarding all the painkillers that 
he was prescribed for an overdose, or overdosing 
through the use of fentanyl patches. Ty knew that 
his brother didn’t want to have to suffer for longer 
than necessary.
“[My brother] knew that he had a death sen­
tence looming over his head,”  Ty says. 
However, none of Clifford’s plans came to 
fruition. He ended up being hospitalized for a 
cellulitis infection, where the hospital staff sent 
home all of the extra medication he was stashing. 
Afterward, Clifford was transferred into a nursing 
home hospice, where he passed in June 2021. 
Like Kira, Ty emphasizes that his brother 
wouldn’t have had to suffer for so long—both 
physically and emotionally—if he had access to 
aid in dying. 
 When some­
one’s soulmate, 
parent, or sibling 
passes, where 
does that 
love go?
