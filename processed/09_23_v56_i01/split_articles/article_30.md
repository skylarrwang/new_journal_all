he first thing I notice is the little 
girl’s grin. Stretched impossibly wide, it 
infects her face with joy. In the photograph, 
she’s leaning into the arms of a woman—her 
mother—who wears a similar smile, and her head 
is cocked back as if poised to launch into a fit of 
giggles. The two have the same haircut, a long bob 
with bangs. They lean into each other with ease. 
The photo, taken in 1992, still radiates a soft 
warmth. The two of them look so happy.

Today, almost thirty years later, Kira Philips—
once the little girl from the photo—sits across 
from me. It’s my first time meeting her, and I’m a 
little nervous. Sometime in the last three decades, 
she’s traded her bob for long, pin straight hair. Her 
cheekbones have become more prominent, but she 
still has the same warm brown eyes. 
I ask her how she’s been, and she briefly grins, 
perhaps out of habit. But the smile hangs stagnant 
on her lips and doesn’t swell with the same verve 
as in the picture. She lets out a shuddery breath. 
“You can lead the questions, and I’ll try to keep 
it together,” she says. “It’s been an emotional cou­
ple of days.”

This past weekend was the two-year anniver­
sary of her mom’s passing.

I connected with Kira after finding her name 
in the Connecticut State Assembly’s legislation 
testimonial archives. Last February, she went 
to Hartford  to testify in favor of  SB 1076: An 
Act Concerning Aid in Dying for Terminally 
Ill Patients. The bill would allow terminally ill 
patients in the state of Connecticut the option 
to die by self-administering lethal medication, 
a procedure dubbed “medical aid in dying” by 
supporters and “assisted suicide” by opponents. 
Bills to legalize this procedure have been annually 
proposed—and shot down—in the Connecticut 
General Assembly for almost a decade. 

A look into the text of SB 1076’s reveals 
pages of medical definitions and procedures. 
Co-sponsored by sixteen senators across the polit­
ical spectrum, the bill stipulates the requirements 
for aid in dying, including that the patient must be 
“of sound mind,” confirmed by an attending physi­
cian; terminally ill, defined as having a prognosis 
of six months or less to live; and able to self-ad­
minister the medication. As I read over these 
documents, I wondered: What has driven this bill 
and the daunting procedure it represents back into the 
General Assembly year after year? 

In September 2018, Kira’s mother Claire 
was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a rare 
form of blood cancer. Kira tells me that her body 
responded “really, really poorly” to chemotherapy 
and that, by October, Claire was in at-home hos­
pice, unable to get out of bed. However, after stay­
ing in hospice for three months, things seemed to 
take a turn for the better. 

By around February, she had begun oral, 
non-invasive treatment and was responding well. 
She was in remission, her cancer cell count was 
decreasing, and she was able to walk and drive 
on her own, as well as pick up old hobbies, like 
painting and baking. However, Kira tells me that 
it was also during this time period—during the 
COVID-19 lockdown—that Claire bought a gun. 
Kira describes that summer to me as a “heated” 
time in her neighborhood. With the Black Lives 
Matter movement in full swing and anti-vaxxer
