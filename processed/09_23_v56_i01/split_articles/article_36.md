The days when the flower pot shatters 
because a gust of wind blows too strongly, 
and I am left with dirt and ceramic 
at my feet, my orchids gone, 
I collect the shattered pot 
in the palm of my hand, 
avoiding the sharp edges. 
I think about the Frenchman 
serving tables, carrying dirty, 
porcelain, holding the remnants
of a meal in his arms. When they 
dropped
and everyone turned as if 
they never heard glass shatter
or that shattered glass meant 
the end of the world. 
Remember what he said.
As he bent over to pick up the big pieces, 
La vie est anti-fragile.
It brings itself back together, 
like skin, 
suturing all its wounds.  
Yet I still try to escape things I canâ€™t see,
as if you can lose everything to air.
