EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This one drive, 
my father put the radio on, 
to replace the other sounds, 
and there was news from Norway, 
speaking of the fish - 
there would be less that year. 
Too bad, I thought. 
Too bad it’s the salmon 
dying off this year, 
my father’s favorite. 
Too bad they swam 
downstream instead of up. 
And too bad, my father thought. 
Too bad my favorite fish is 
flopping up dead on the banks 
like my real estate. 
I don’t know what my mother thought. 
My brother, 
who never ate a fish in his life 
and hated silence, asked: 
Norway? 
They bring the fish from Norway? 
And nobody said a word to him. 
Not even the radio 
which crackled like a laugh 
and died.


**Title: Meditation on Monday Honey**
**Author: Isabel Menon**

After Craig Arnold’s “Meditation on a Grapefruit”
To wake bare feet 
into cool tile    glassied by
the pall of night
the promise of morning
          To yawn toes apart
at the chill     stamping
sole into ceramic
             To corpse to the kitchen 
to show you love    despite 
the call of night 
     To rustle the silverware 
into windchime laughter          to grab 
the smallest spoon     still 
stained with 
yesterday & the hardness
of its leftbehind water
 To sticky thumbs 
on smooth glass     the lid gasping 
itself open     the sweet 
sailing into stale air  
To lower slow as syrup     to dip 
to click against jarbottom     to lift  
& to unspool gloss ribbons 
like confessions 
To twirl spidersilk laces 
into one another     spiraling metal
so sugar eats sugar 
like blown glass 
& only then to contour lips 
to the curve 
             to taste 
                the tacky  
                       the treacle  
                           and trickle 
into the promised morning 
a softening 	
the sink 
each day slipping 
each day sticking
