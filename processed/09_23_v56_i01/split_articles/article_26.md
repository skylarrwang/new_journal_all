Lost Time
D
arrell Atkinson’s hands trembled 
as he carved at the metal bar, sharpening 
it till it was a kind of knife. “Forever My 
Lady” by Jodeci dragged through the air, cranked 
out over 94.3 WYBC. Up until that day, he still 
had hope. He had spent two years in the jail on 
Whalley Avenue and at Northern Correctional 
Facility, Connecticut’s only supermax prison, 
awaiting his day in court. He’d rejected a plea 
bargain of forty-eight years and instead insisted 
on a jury trial, maintaining his innocence. But 
that day, March 4, 1994, he was found guilty and 
sentenced to ninety years in prison.

That night, the first night of his lifelong 
sentence, he held the makeshift knife to his 
chest. He closed his eyes and saw the face of his 
mother. The look on her face said: Boy, don’t you 
do it. He sighed, dropping the knife. He had four 
children—three sons and a daughter—and he 
wanted to see them grow up. He wanted to be 
able to hold them again someday.

Twenty-nine years later, Atkinson’s voice 
grew softer as he told me about his family, and 
about how painful it was not to see them for the 
thirty-one years he served in prison. I’m the sec­
ond person to learn of his attempted suicide, he 
said. The first was his mother, who died while he 
was incarcerated.

Atkinson is out of jail, now—living in a 
halfway house, speaking with me—because of 
Connecticut’s commutation policy. He was one 
of the 106 people in Connecticut to receive a sen­
tence commutation since December 2021, reduc­
ing his sentence by fifty-nine years. 

While Atkinson knows it as the tool that 
gave him his freedom, Connecticut’s commu­
tation policy has proven both contentious and 
precarious. In just the past five years, the pro­
cess has been halted and amended with stricter 
parameters multiple times. Debates between 
victims’ advocates, incarcerated people, lawyers, 
and political figures configure commutations in a 
perpetual state of flux—seemingly straddling the 
lines between justice and injustice, rehabilitation 
and punishment. 

The Extraordinary Option

I
n Connecticut, people like Atkinson—
those incarcerated for certain violent crimes 
including felony murder—are ineligible for parole. 
Instead, incarcerated individuals serving lengthy 
sentences have several avenues for amending their 
sentence. The first option, and probably the most 
difficult, is a direct appeal within thirty days of a 
conviction. The second is to file a habeas corpus, 
a petition for a new trial. The third is a sentence 
modification, which is decided by a judge. And 
the fourth is a sentence commutation.

A sentence commutation, rather than an 
appeal or habeas, does not reverse a conviction. 
But the chances of winning an appeal are low: 
Atkinson filed multiple habeas corpus petitions 
for an appeal while incarcerated, in both cases 
arguing ineffective counsel. Each time, a judge 
denied his petition.

The crux of the debate around commuta­
tions lies in whether or not individuals convicted 
of violent crimes deserve a second look. Miriam 
Gohara, a Clinical Professor of Law at the Yale 
Law School, said that second-look statutes—like 
parole or commutations—are not a constitu­
tional right in the same way that the right to a 
jury trial is. “It’s purely discretionary,” Gohara 
said. “But it’s so critical as a safety valve.”

When a judge hands down a sentence, 
Gohara said, they cannot know whether a sen­
tencing standard will hold up over time. In 2012, 
for instance, the Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. 
Alabama that life without the possibility of parole 
for juveniles was unconstitutional for non-ho­
micide crimes and could not be mandatory for 
homicide crimes. Additionally, Connecticut 
abolished the death penalty for future crimes in 
2012 but continued to have eleven men on death 
row until 2015, when the Connecticut Supreme 
Court ruled it unconstitutional. In other words, 
judges rely on second-look provisions to know 
that a sentence can be changed if circumstances 
beyond the crime itself change. 

Over time, sentencing standards for the same 
types of crimes have gotten shorter. Given that 
a significant percentage of the prison population 
in Connecticut was sentenced decades ago, this 
means if they were to commit the same crimes 
today, they might receive a much shorter sentence. 
There are about half as many people incarcerated 
in Connecticut today as there were  fifteen years 
ago, with a little more than ten thousand today 
compared to about twenty thousand in 2008. 

In other states, the power to commute a 
sentence typically resides with the governor of a 
state. But in Connecticut, that power is instead 
held by the Board of Pardons and Paroles, whose 
members are appointed by the governor and 
have experience in social work, law enforcement, 
criminal justice, or substance abuse treatment 
and prevention. When deciding whether to com­
mute a sentence, the Board previously considered 
factors including the seriousness and recency of 
a conviction, the incarcerated individual’s con­
duct while serving their sentence, the impact on 
victims and the community, the extent of the 
individual’s rehabilitation, whether the length 
or form of the individual’s sentence is consistent 
with contemporary sentencing standards, and the 
extent to which continued service of the individ­
ual’s sentence is in the interest of justice.

In order to apply for a commutation, incar­
cerated individuals must have served at least ten 
years of their sentence. And, Atkinson’s attorney 
Alexander Taubes LAW ’15 said, if you get denied, 
you have to wait another five years before applying.

Incarcerated individuals thus have to decide which 
types of sentence modifications to apply for and 
in what order, in case having been denied for one 
hearing might prejudice them in the other.

In the early nineteen-nineties, Connecticut 
legislators removed the possibility of parole and 
good time credits for homicide offenses, which 
includes felony murder. That means the only 
option available to a majority of the people serv­
ing lengthy sentences—which tend to be for vio­
lent crimes—is a sentence commutation. These 
commutations are, in criminal justice professor at 
the University of New Haven and former state 
legislator Michael Lawlor’s words, the “extraor­
dinary” option.

Freedom for Whom?

T
aubes represented forty-three of the 
106 sentences that were commuted between 
December 2021 and April 2023. In total, his cli­
ents had 751 years taken off their sentences, with 
an average of 17.5 years. 

These victories were largely unprecedented. 
Previously, from 2016 to 2021—including a hiatus 
in 2019 and 2020 to reevaluate the commutation 
process—the state had averaged only one com­
mutation a year. Many advocates both for and 
against the state’s commutations policy attribute 
the jump to a natural increase in applications fol­
lowing the pause, but this rise in commutations 
raised alarm bells for some. 

The push against commutations for vio­
lent crimes picked up at the start of 2023, with 
some victim advocates and several Republican 
legislators advocating for limiting commuta­
tions to non-violent crimes. In March, Governor 
Ned Lamont replaced the chair of the Board—
who some legislators felt was too liberal when 
commuting sentences—with Jennifer Medina 
Zaccagnini, a former social worker who served 
on the board since 2008. Lamont also suspended 
commutations entirely while the Board reviewed 
its policies, following pressure from Republicans 
and some victims’ families.

Part of the outrage was because forty-four 
of the seventy-one sentences commuted in 2022 
were for murder. For people like Atkinson—
those serving lengthy sentences without the 
possibility of parole—a sentence commutation 
can seem like the only shot at freedom. And as 
Lawlor suggested, the minimum of ten years 
served for eligibility explains why so many of the 
commuted sentences are for violent crimes: the 
people applying for a commutation have to be 
serving a long enough sentence to begin with.

“How are you supposed to have a second 
chance on anything at life if people want you 
to get out of jail when you’re 80, 90 years old?” 
Atkinson said. “They’re just clearing the path for 
your funeral.”

The uptick in commutations sparked con­
cern from some victims’ families, who worried 
their own perpetrators would be released from 
prison. The Board of Pardons and Paroles notifies 
the family of homicide victims of the application, 
even if the hearing ends up being denied. The 
board also takes into consideration statements 
from the victim’s family and prosecutors.

Plea bargains—which often include waiving 
the right to appeal—further complicate the ave­
nues through which incarcerated individuals can 
have another chance at freedom. Some victims’ 
families feel that commutations undermine the 
strength of these plea bargain stipulations, acting 
as a loophole for freedom. 

“It can almost be insulting to them because 
it’s like a contract,” said Jessica Pizzano from 
Survivors of Homicide. “‘[The accused individ­
ual] willingly accepted their sentence, and then 
to turn around how many years later and change 
that is extremely difficult for our families.”

Survivors of Homicide 
is a Connecticut-based, non-
profit organization that pro­
vides support and advocacy 
to anyone connected with 
a homicide victim. Pizzano 
stressed that the organiza­
tion is apolitical with the 
sole goal of providing sup­
port to its members. Pizzano 
also emphasized that most 
of the families the organi­
zation works with do not 
have a problem with com­
mutation hearings as a whole, 
but do believe that violent 
crimes like murder, sexual 
assault, and felony murder 
should be excluded from 
commutations.

Today, murder charges often come with 
shorter sentences, or the charge itself may be low­
ered to manslaughter or felony murder, Pizzano 
said. “That’s very hard for our families right now 
to be told that due to the current trends, this is 
the sentence that we can give,” Pizzano said. 
“Fifteen years for killing someone, that doesn’t sit 
well with our families.”

Over the last few months, the Board met 
with various stakeholders on both sides in order 
to develop a new commutation policy. On August 
30, the Board heard three cases in its first com­
mutations hearings since the pause. All were for 
murder convictions from the mid-nineties. And 
one, Miguel Sanchez, was granted a commutation. 
Sanchez had been incarcerated since 1997 and the 
Board reduced his sentence by fifteen years, bring­
ing his new effective sentence to forty-five years. 

Attorney David Bothwell, the legisla­
tive and administrative advisor to the Board 
of Pardons and Paroles, said the Board is now 
looking for individuals to show “extraordinary 
and compelling” circumstances towards reha­
bilitation, beyond participating in programs the 
Department of Correction offers. This is the main 
change to the policy. Victim input, the nature of 
the crime, and the seriousness of the individual’s 
involvement will also continue to be taken into 
consideration.

The new policy is vague to a fault, Taubes said.
More critically, it raises the issue of what 
rehabilitation means in a prison setting. How 
does someone who maintains their innocence 
demonstrate accountability for a crime they may 
not have committed? And can a prison environ­
ment really allow for “extraordinary and compel­
ling” forms of rehabilitation?

A Deeper History

A
tkinson grew up in the Hill, a neighbor­
hood composed mainly of Black and Hispanic 
residents just south of downtown New Haven. 
When he was 3 years old, his mother picked him 
up and walked to her sister’s two streets down. She 
put him down on the porch steps, rang the door­
bell, and walked away. Atkinson stayed with his 
aunt for a day before she called the Department 
of Children and Families. For the next twelve 
years, he bounced around 
foster homes and group 
homes. His mother never 
knew that he lived just a 
few streets down for most 
of that time. He walked 
past her once, when he was 
14, at the King’s Department 
Store. She didn’t recognize 
him. It felt like a gut punch.

A year later, Atkinson 
ran away from a group home 
in Massachusetts. When he 
arrived at his mother’s home, 
she pulled him in. They 
sat for hours, running over 
everything that had hap­
pened. “Why did you give 
me up?” he asked her. She 
told him that she hadn’t been 
ready to be a mother. 

“How am I supposed to return? To love 
you?” Atkinson paused—it isn’t an easy subject. 
His instinct was to protect himself, to resist the 
mother who had once abandoned him. I asked 
him how he was able to forgive her.

All families are complicated, he said. But 
when you make it back home, when you walk 
through the door, you feel like you’re 2 years 
old again, running into your parents’ arms. “I 
always wanted to be loved by my family; I 
didn’t want to leave this earth not feeling 
loved,” Atkinson said.

Over time, Atkinson felt like he could go to 
his mother for anything. She was a stern woman, 
someone you wanted as a friend but not as an 
enemy. He picked some of that up from her, he 
said, but he was also committed to softening his 
anger so he could make her proud.

When Atkinson was 17, he met Michelle, 
who was a few years older than him. She came 
up to his bedroom window to get his attention 
on behalf of her friend. Right away, he found her 
“intoxicating.” A few days later, his mother called 
out to him from the front door. There was a girl 
at the door for him: Michelle. “She was the love 
of my life,” he said. “And I don’t throw that word 
love around.”

At 18, Atkinson had his first son, Bobby. 
Michelle told Atkinson he had to get serious—he 
couldn’t keep getting in trouble for petty crimes.

But Atkinson, at the time in his late teens, 
frequently found himself face-to-face with cops. 
The Hill has historically had the highest num­
ber of people in New Haven living below the 
federal poverty line. Atkinson recalls the police 
making frequent rounds in the area. In the late 
nineteen-eighties, this was far from unusual: 
intentional policies pushed from 1970 onward 
had brought about the era of mass incarceration 
in the U.S., as legislators pushed for stricter sen­
tencing laws, tough-on-crime policing—which 
targeted primarily Black and Brown neighbor­
hoods—and growing prison populations. From 
1970 to 1985, the national prison population rose 
from 196,429 to 502,507, according to data from 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics’s Prisoners series.

Connecticut was no exception to this 
national trend. In 1968, Connecticut established 
the Department of Correction—the first cen­
tral authority in the nation to oversee all youth 
and adult correctional institutions and parole 
functions in the state. Connecticut’s prison pop­
ulation grew rapidly, in part due to legislating 
definite sentences and eliminating parole for 
crimes committed after July 1981. Between 1980 
and 1990, the incarcerated population doubled, 
the number of prison staff tripled, and the DOC 
budget quadrupled.

Those effects are still felt today. An October 
2022 report by the Prison Policy Initiative on redis­
tricting data in Connecticut found that six cities—
Hartford, Waterbury, New Britain, Bridgeport, 
New London, and New Haven—were home to 
over half of the state’s incarcerated population, 
despite making up only 17 percent of Connecticut’s 
total population. High incarceration rates dispro­
portionately affect Connecticut’s communities of 
color: in April 2020, the DOC reported that 44 
percent of the prison population was Black, while 
only 13 percent of Connecticut residents are Black.

Atkinson served his first prison sentence at 
age 19, a fifteen-month sentence for drug-related 
charges. After being released, in November 1991, 
Atkinson was ready to turn his life around. He
