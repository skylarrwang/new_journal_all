**Title: Barber**

When I get my haircut I like to imagine 
The barber is you. 
I don’t notice the Eminem playing 
or the feline purr of the clippers 
or the whir of electricity 
from the shop’s neon Suavecito sign. 
I think about his big and soft hands 
that press my ear to my cheek 
and crane my neck back 
showing me that I’m handsome. 
Me looking into the mirror 
You looking at me and finally asking 
How was your day? 
Got plans this weekend? 
and you are beside me 
grazing my temples 
measuring and sectioning out strands of me, 
carefully untangling each one 
while I gaze, dimly 
thinking about those fake silver rings 
that leave turquoise specters around your giant 
fingers that once petted my stubble like a stray cat. 
So when I see my haircut is uneven 
and I know it’ll have to grow it out again I still 
tell him 
It’s just what I asked for! 
I’ll see you again! 
That way I leave without losing 
more than that to an EyeVac.
