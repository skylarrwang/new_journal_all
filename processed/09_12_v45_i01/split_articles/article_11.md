n 1989, a Palestinian extremist 
walked into an office in the 
West Bank and kidnapped Chris 
George. George had been working 
for Save the Children, an international 
humanitarian 
organization 
that 
provides food, medical care, and 
education for children in need. 
“He liked me,” George said of his 
kidnapper. “He was just using me 
for political ends.” George was a 
prominent American, and the extremist 
had been to the organization’s office 
to discuss the construction of a 
kindergarten in the man’s refugee 
camp. After thirty-five hours, George 
was released and given a thirteen-page 
letter for then President George H. W. 
Bush criticizing US support of Israel. 
The Israeli secret service killed the 
extremist a week later. 


After his release, George said in 
an interview, “They were nice to me. 
I practiced my Arabic during this 
period, I ate my food – fish.” George 
handles things stoically, which has also 
helped him navigate the uncertain 
terrain of refugee resettlement in 
New Haven.
“Again? 3-2-1?”
“3-2-1.”
The documentary crew, three 
students from Southern Connecticut 
University, started filming outside the 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant 
Services building, or IRIS. George, 
now IRIS’s executive director for the 
last seven years, was wearing white 
khaki pants, a gray shirt, black shoes, 
and a brown belt. He has gray hair, 
wears glasses, and has a mustache. 
The pin on his shirt said “support 
refugees,” in bright pink letters. He 
wore a black digital watch and used 
the earbuds on his iPhone to make 
phone calls. 
“Welcome to IRIS,” he said, 
“and we are your refugee integration 
service.” The crew stopped filming 
and they walked inside the building. 
George started to clean up the mess 
in the front room, which was filled 
with plastic bags full of clothes and 
scattered papers and magazines. 
“We get a lot of donations,” he said 
with a laugh. IRIS has served almost 
four thousand refugees from Iraq, 
Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia over the 
past twenty-five years, and each year 
they work with about two hundred 
new clients, about a third of all the 
refugees who enter Connecticut, 
George told the filmmakers. Since 
1980, 
Connecticut 
has 
resettled  
twenty-eight 
thousand 
refugees. 
According to the US Department 
of State, three million refugees have 
come to the US since 1975, more than 
twice the combined total number of 
refugees accepted by the nine other 
countries with resettlement programs. 
But the US still only resettles less than 
one percent of the 16 million refugees 
worldwide. 
Reading those numbers, I was 
struck by the enormity of the task 
of resettlement. I couldn’t help but 
think of the old tale about an old man 
who walked down the beach and saw 
a child returning washed-up starfish 
to the ocean. When the old man told 
the child his actions wouldn’t make a 
difference, the boy picked up another 
starfish and threw it back in saying, “I 
made a difference for that one.” I have 
trouble understanding how anyone 
can have that child’s attitude toward 
such astounding numbers. Where 
does that sense of duty and obligation 
come from? But George seems less 
interested in speaking to me about the 
source of his relentless commitment 
than about the necessity of this work 
for the refugees he assists. His steady 
approach helps his clients find routine 
in a process loaded with insecurity. 
Inside the IRIS building, there 
were two Iraqi refugees sitting in 
the main reception office and four 
African refugees in a large room to the 
side, working with a volunteer to fill 
out applications. The Iraqis appeared 
to be husband and wife, middle aged. 
George asked for their permission 
to be filmed, but they shook their 
heads. The camera crew moved into 
the office, and they started filming 
with the refugees behind them. “Our 
job is to help them be self-sufficient,” 
George said. “We are so fortunate 
to get incredible volunteers: high 
schools, synagogues, even our clients 
are volunteers.” In the food pantry 
down the hall, families can come in 
to get two bags of groceries every 
Wednesday. Since it was Thursday, the 
room was empty. 
A woman walked up to George 
and said, “So far so good?” 
“So far so great.” 
The crew asked him to stand 
by a wall near the reception area and 
give them an introduction to the work 
IRIS does. George smiled and began 
to deliver a speech on what they do 
at IRIS. A large part of George’s job 
is public speaking and outreach. He’s 
a comfortable and relaxed public 
speaker, but he stumbled at the end 
and the crew stopped filming. They 
asked him to try again, and George 
gave the same speech, word for word, 
the words seeming to come naturally: 
“A refugee is someone who has 
a well founded fear of persecution. 
Hopefully, some go back to the country 
they fled from if the persecution ends. 
Some integrate in the country they 
fled to. And some come here and work 
with us. We meet them at the airport, 
send them to a furnished apartment. 
We help these new Americans get 
off to a good start. That’s our job, to 
make them self-sufficient. This is a 
lifesaving program.” 
George let the film crew take 
some footage around the office and 
then sat down on a couch in the 
reception area next to me. 
“Sometimes,” he said, “I wish we 
were back to the no-press policy, but 
I just got off the phone with a major 
apartment complex. They’d never 
heard of refugee integration. They’re 
giving us a great price for a three- to 
four-bedroom apartment, and they 
want to do more business with us.” 
George said this isn’t a typical day at 
the IRIS office, and I asked what a 
typical day would be like. He smiled 
and said that there is nothing routine 
about refugee resettlement.
met George weeks earlier at a local 
café. His shirt-sleeves were rolled 
to his elbow and he was carrying a 
worn-out planner. He apologized for 
being late; one of IRIS’ clients had 
called because the client’s roommate, 
an elderly refugee from Iraq, had 
left without telling anyone where 
he’d gone. George went over to the 
apartment, but there was nothing he 
could do. All business, George opened 
his planner on the table: he would be 
at a refugee resettlement conference
