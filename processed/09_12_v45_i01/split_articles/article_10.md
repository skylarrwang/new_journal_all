**Gateway Community College Opens its Doors**

For ritual’s sake, it took about a 
dozen pairs of scissors to cut the blue 
ribbon and open New Haven’s newest 
institution of learning, located four 
blocks away from Yale’s Old Campus. 
When the ribbon fell, the couple 
hundred attendees cheered. The 
celebrations, attended by an estimated 
total of eight hundred people, would 
assume that the economic man, homo 
economicus, will be voting on November 
6. 
But in picking Rep. Paul Ryan 
as his running mate, Romney has 
shifted from his earlier reliance on 
pocketbook issues. His recent focus 
on welfare, entitlements, and deficits 
reflects 
the 
Romney 
campaign’s 
realignment with the principles of 
small-government 
conservatism. 
Traditionally, candidates pivot toward 
the center in the general election to 
appeal to the median voter. But now 
the Romney campaign, wants to frame 
this election as a battle for the soul of 
the country, not just a referendum on 
four years of economic news, as noted 
in an August 28 article in the National 


continue for at least seven hours. 
The public ceremonies August 
29 marked the opening of Gateway 
Community College, whose student 
population is currently comparable to 
Yale’s in number. The main campus’s 
move downtown, to a building just 
four blocks from Old Campus, 
is expected to increase Gateway’s 
enrollment capacity to roughly fifteen 
thousand. It took nine years to plan 
and construct the 360,000 square 
foot space and the building is LEED-
certified, meeting US Green Building 
Council standards for sustainability.
At the ceremony, Gary Cole, a 
1976 Gateway graduate, ate at a table 
outside where he could follow the 
festivities and compare the smaller 
Long Wharf campus to the new 
building. A disabled veteran in his late 
60s, he said he attended school with 
fellow veterans who were all taking 
advantage of their benefits. Cole, 
who pays the Gateway tuition for 
his granddaughter, spent the grand 
opening talking to other Gateway 
alumni, 
appreciating 
those 
who 
remembered him and remembered 
their former professors. 
“I hope they get involved with 
Yale,” he said of the school’s new 
campus. “Because it’s downtown, they 
can get affiliated.”
The question remains: how will 
Yale interact with the community 
college’s main campus move to the 
corner of Church and George? 
One Gateway alumnus is sure 
that these new faces, while bringing 
business to downtown New Haven, 
won’t be wildly welcome to mingle 
with the Yalies. 
“They always looked down on 
us,” said Sasha Lay, who graduated 
from Gateway’s North Haven campus 
in May and has started at Southern 
Connecticut State University. “Yale 
students really like to keep to 
themselves.” 
The former Director of Career 
Services at Gateway, Robert A. Miles, 
called Yale and Gateway “different 
universes.” The average age of a 
Gateway student is 29, he said, and the 
majority of students attend part-time 
to get their Associate degrees. Still, 
Miles, who retired in 2009, is hopeful 
that the two schools will partner—
socially, philosophically, academically, 
economically—and that Yale will 
mindfully create space for Gateway in 
New Haven. 
When 
asked 
whether 
Yale 
supports Gateway financially, Lauren 
Zucker, a representative of Yale’s 
Office of New Haven and State 
Affairs, responded, “Yes, we are 
supportive of Gateway and continue 
to work closely with them.”
Hundreds 
gathered 
to 
hear 
speeches by many involved in the 
school, including executives involved 
in the construction, the President of 
the school, and politicians Mayor John 
DeStefano, Congresswoman Rosa 
L. DeLauro, U.S. Senator Richard 
Blumenthal, State Senator Martin 
Looney, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. 
Malloy 
stressed 
that 
celebration was in honor of “not 
bricks and mortar, but our future” 
and that the opening of the Church 
Street location was a step, not an end. 
He spoke for Connecticut when he 
said, “we will have no progress in this 
state unless we throw our shoulder 
to the wheel, unless we produce the 
kind of product in this state that will 
allow us to compete with the rest of 
the world.” 
While most listened to the 
series of speeches, many, like Cole, 
wandered the school’s halls, filled for 
the occasion with booths for various 
New Haven staples. 
At one booth sat Peter Johnson 
DIV ‘02, who wore a bowtie, and 
said that he hoped to start Christian 
programming at the college.
Some smaller booths ran out of 
food, and free samples abounded. The 
cafeteria was also up and running. An 
older woman, wearing a cap, asked for 
the price of a sandwich. It was free, 
and, pleased, she ate her sandwich at 
an available table. For those who grew 
hungry, the Boar’s Head booth served 
a selection of packed sandwiches while 
Temple Grille took orders for custom-
made salads. One mother sat by the 
kiosks with her two children outside 
the auditorium, where only standing 
space was left. Inside, the Elm City 
Co-op Market laid out fresh apples 
across from a salon’s hair braiding 
station, and hushed chatter came from 
the new, high-ceilinged cafeteria. 
The afternoon brought a series 
of group tours through the ninety 
classrooms, library, culinary center, 
and various other facilities. It looked 
different 
from 
Gateway’s 
previous main campus—the tour 
attendees 
enjoyed 
pointing 
out 
different academic spaces. 
Like Yale’s campus, the building 
creates its own unique space in 
downtown 
New 
Haven. 
The 
standardization of form and style that 
dominates its two blocks sets it apart 
from the rest of the neighborhood. 
However, its spaces, unlike Yale’s, are 
centered around the indoors. 
The city’s leaders hope the new 
addition to the skyline will become 
a symbol of community and hope 
for New Haven. “While there is 
another college downtown, Gateway 
Community College will be the first 
college they will see and it will be the 
college that will serve our families, our 
businesses and deliver our possibilities 
and opportunities,” DeStefano said at 
the event.
