an 
unspoken 
understanding that students 
leaving 
Yale 
will 
find 
employment that requires them to 
work with their minds. We didn’t come 
to this university to train for manual 
labor. But all my experiences—in the 
field, in the construction site, and 
even in the classroom—suggest that 
physical work can teach a depth of 
mental strength that we do not acquire 
in our academic studies.

I’ve spent my summers at farms 
and summer camps; I’ve cleaned 
toilets, washed dishes, herded goats, 
stayed up all night with vomiting

braided garlic, and unloaded milk

boarded a plane to Sitka, Alaska, to 
join a group of Yale students doing 
construction work at Sheldon Jackson 
Campus, the new home of Alaska 
Arts Southeast.

The Sheldon Jackson College 
on Baranof Island, in the Alaska

2011, the campus’s twenty buildings 
and more than twenty of its acres 
were given to Alaska Arts Southeast, 
with the hope that the shuttered 
classrooms and dormitories would 
grow into a thriving center for arts and 
humanities. Hundreds of volunteers 
donated thousands of work hours 
and half a million dollars to restore
