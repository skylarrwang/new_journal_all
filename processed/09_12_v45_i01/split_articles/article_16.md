,either the muscles adapted themselves 
to the motion, or I got used to the 
slight ache. The satisfaction came 
from the repetition, from the mere 
fact of continuing, from the action of 
going over every piece of the beam 
with equal attention. A cut corner 
would manifest itself as a visible 
blot. To do a good job, I just needed 
to be patient, to stick with it. Part of 
me feels proud of that patience and 
stamina. That part agrees 
with Schmidt when he said of 
repetition, “To me that’s kind 
of the essence of hard work. 
If you want to do something 
well, you have to do it for a 
long time, and repetitively.” 
But an equally strong part 
argues back that just because 
something is satisfying doesn’t 
make it worthwhile. Abstract 
work is often unsatisfying 
because it’s harder to reach 
a definite conclusion in a 
specific time frame.


Members of the crew 
were quick to point out that 
manual work often required 
sophisticated, 
abstract 
problem solving. We spent 
two days in mid-July clearing 
a roof of stones, moss 
and gravel, then removing 
waterlogged foam insulation 
so that the roof could be re-
waterproofed and insulated in 
the coming weeks. A group of 
volunteers including Slomski-
Pritz devised a system for 
safely removing gravel from the 
roof. It took them three separate 
arrangements of tarp and cement 
blocks to create a functional system. 
As I listened to Slomski-Pritz 
describe the process of building the 
ramp, two things became clear. The 
first is that it is ridiculous to describe 
manual work as mindless. The kind 
of problem solving he talked through 
is essentially the same as the kind 
I use when developing an idea for a 
paper or solving a problem set. Try 
one thing. See if it works. When it 
doesn’t, figure out why not. Try again 
until you get it right. In the process, 
you discover something about how 
a text or a concept or a ramp works. 
The second thing I observed is that, 
as totally unskilled amateurs, the crew 
had a lot to learn.


For some, construction work 
meant a chance to explore academic 
interests in a new setting. Anne 
Lovelace, a psychology major who 
plans to attend medical school, at first 
found her choice to join the work 
crew difficult to explain to others. 
“Construction in and of itself,” 
she said, “doesn’t really match with 
my academic interest or my career 
interest.” But to her surprise, the work 
crew offered a laboratory unlike any 
she had encountered at Yale. “A lot of 
my academic background comes from 
thinking about how people work and 
the way groups interact,” Lovelace 
said. “Working on the construction 
crew, I brought my psych perspective 
and was paying attention to how the 
group worked, what people needed, 
and how people played off each 
other.” The work crew provided 
Lovelace with a group dynamic to 
explore that was different from the 
seminar groups and athletic teams she 
was used to observing at Yale. 
She had the chance to observe 
a group figuring out how to 
use tools and resources to 
complete a concrete task.


Dairanieh 
specifically 
came to Sitka in large part 
to complement his work 
in 
the 
classroom, 
where 
he has been working with 
wood as a sculptor and artist 
for the past year. He was 
drawn to the renovations 
because he wanted to learn 
formal carpentry technique. 
Dairanieh said he gained not 
just woodworking skills, but 
a sense of responsibility and 
belonging to the community as 
well: “I was given a to-do list, a 
deadline and basic instructions 
and I, an untrained outsider, 
was trusted—by the foreman, 
by SFAC administration, by 
Sitka residents—to carry it 
out, to work on a project 
the entire community cared 
deeply about. It was beautiful 
and humbling.”


Indeed, proponents of manual 
work assert that one of its major 
benefits is that it teaches responsibility 
in an immediate way that abstract 
tasks cannot. When the product 
of your work is visible, and you 
are held directly accountable for it 
by people you know, you are more 
inclined—forced, even—to put in 
your best effort. The thought of 
embarrassment is powerful. It’s easier 
to dismiss a paper that you bullshitted 
It is ridiculous to 
describe manual 
work as mindless. The 
kind of problem-solving 
he talked through is 
essentially the same 
as the kind I use when 
developing an idea for 
a paper or solving a 
problem set.

and never have to read again than to 
ignore a sloppy painting job that you 
see every day. Manual work forces you 
to exercise integrity and care. 
And these are qualities that we 
would hope for in our leaders, people 
in the positions that some Yalies, and 
other similarly-trained students, may 
hold one day. Crawford writes, “Why 
not encourage gifted students to learn 
a trade, if only in the summers, so that 
their fingers will be crushed once or 
twice before they go on to run the 
country?” Schmidt put the point more 
mildly, but the sentiment was the same: 
“People who are positioned to make 
large decisions about other people, 
who aren’t grounded in the tangible 
activity of other humans, often make 
really big mistakes.” Powerful people, 
he argues, need to be anchored in the 
material world. 


T
he inherent value of working 
with one’s hands is complicated 
by the various situations in which 
people can execute that labor. I worry 
that writers like Crawford give too 
easy an answer to a complex question. 
In one of the letters responding to his 
article, Deborah Barnbaum and Gene 
Pendleton pointed out, “Matthew 
Crawford made it clear that his 
education and résumé afforded him 
a great deal of flexibility.” They also 
pointed out that he decides his own 
hours, rates, and pace: “Had he been 
clocking in and out on a factory floor, 
it is dubious whether he would have 
sung the praises of working with his 
hands,” they added.


Crawford comes out of a 
tradition of writers including Wendell 
Berry and Edward Abbey, who have 
advocated for the ethics and politics
