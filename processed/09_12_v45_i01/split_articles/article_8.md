“All voting is a sort of  gaming, like 
checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral 
tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong.”
-Henry David Thoreau

Uncertainty and chance are 
beginning to feel familiar to many 
Americans. The experiences of the 
last four years have left their mark on 
the American psyche and seem to be 
defining this fall’s coming election. 
These conditions can also be 
fournd in one New Haven resident’s 
new board game. In “Generations,” 
a single roll of the dice can undo 
anyone’s hard-won success. Through 
a mixture of prudence, cooperation, 
and good luck, players chart the 
lives of their avatars, negotiating the 
advantages or disadvantages that they  
arbitrarily received at birth. They have 
power over their fortunes only to the 
extent that they have the power to 
vote.

Over the last nine months, J.R. 
Logan, the director of new media 
at the United Way of Greater New 
Haven, has been developing this more 
sophisticated, 
high-stakes 
version 
of “Life.” The paper-and-die  game 
of life, death, or poverty offers far 
more futures for its players than the 
bourgeois options and risks that  its 
precursor permits. 

Logan’s game grew out of a 
tradition of pedagogical board games 
at United Way, where staffers often 
use simple games to explain the 
workings of charitable fundraising 
to prospective donors. “I’ve always 
believed in the power of games to 
educate,” Logan said. For its part, 
“Generations” teaches players about 
the tension between present and 
future generations, and between self-
interest and the good of society.

When I met him at his apartment, 
he showed me the game’s earliest 
renderings—a 
simple 
spreadsheet 
printout, 
full 
of 
handwritten 
annotations and rule changes. Even 
after designing a sturdier version 
through MakeHaven, New Haven’s 
collaborative workshop for tinkerers 
and inventors, Logan and his friends 
are still adding to the library of events 
that may befall characters in the board 
game. “You are hit by a bus,” reads 
one of the more tragic cards a player 
might draw. Players can also die by 
skydiving.  Players must choose among 
candidates with different rankings of 
priority on three major categories: 
education, health, and the economy. 
In an initial “primary round,” players 
with 
more 
money 
automatically 
have more political power. The top 
challenger gets to face the incumbent 
in a general election, and each player 
gets one vote. 

As with real elections, the game’s 
elections present both short-term 
and long-term choices for players. 
For example, a candidate could 
reduce health care in the short run, 
while ensuring permanent wealth for 
players with incomes above a certain 
threshold. All candidates’ platforms 
make immediate changes to the 
society, but also change a separate, 
“baseline” measure of the three 
categories. The next round inherits the 
baseline resulting from the previous 
game, altering their starting conditions 
for the next round of votes.

In 
one 
particular 
instance, 
Logan recalls, players in one round 
kept electing leaders committed to 
improving 
education 
and 
health 
who were also negligent toward the 
economy. In the following rounds,
