Photographs by Sarah Eckinger


These images were taken at the Winchester Arms Factory, 
which has stood in New Haven just north of Yale since the late 
19th century.
“I think of these photographs as not only a documentation of 
urban exploration, but also an example of how sometimes the 
most beautiful images come from those things that have been 
long forgotten.” – Sarah Eckinger
