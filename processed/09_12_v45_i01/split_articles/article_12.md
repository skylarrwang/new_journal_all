with three hundred other non-
profits all of next week, a meeting 
at Quinnipiac on April 10, a meeting 
in new London at 7 p.m. three days 
later, and on Monday, he would be 
welcoming a family of seven from 
Darfur. 
“You could come to that,” he 
said. George gave me a list of his 
colleagues to talk to while he was 
away, and after second thought added 
Ron Berger to the list, his best 
friend since third grade. Berger 
knows him well, and was the 
only person on the list George 
didn’t know from work. 

I 
called Berger on a Thursday 
morning. “Can you hear me 
okay? I’m in my truck,” he said. 
Berger teaches a course at the 
Harvard Graduate School of 
Education, and he drives there 
every week from his home 
in 
Amherst, 
Massachusetts. 
He worked as a public school 
teacher for ten years, and works 
as the Chief Program Officer 
of Expeditionary Learning, an 
organization that opens schools 
and partners with existing ones 
in urban and rural schools to 
improve the quality of struggling 
school districts.
Berger said that even as a boy 
growing up, George was magnetic. 
“Chris has a mythic and heroic 
quality,” he said. George was an 
all-American athlete and ran cross-
country before being recruited for 
the lacrosse team, where he was co-
captain and an all-star player, a state 
champ in high school and the first 
string all American midfield. “Every 
year,” Berger said, “Chris goes back 
to Montclair for the alumni lacrosse 
game. They play a game against guys 
who are twenty-eight or twenty-one. 
He’s fifty-eight and plays against them. 
He has this great 1970’s lacrosse shirt, 
the same shirt he wore when he was in 
high school. He’s playing this alumni 
game in this old antique shirt.” His 
long-term loyalty to the team shows a 
doggedness of character, a man who 
never gives up.
Berger recalled getting into his 
truck in 1989, turning on his radio 
and hearing the first story on NPR. 
It was about George’s kidnapping. He 
had been the first foreigner kidnapped 
in Israel for political reasons, making 
it national news. Berger had been 
shocked, and now so was I. In the few 
weeks I had spent talking to George 
about the significant details of his 
life, he had never mentioned being 
kidnapped. 

stopped by George’s office a few 
days later. The walls were covered 
with newspaper clippings: a headline 
from the New Haven Register 
reads “Iraqi refugees find America 
challenging,” another, “Wars toll 
heavy for many Iraqi children,” and 
finally, “Afghan refugees now happily 
resettled.” An Indiana Jones hat sits 
on a basketball on top of a bookshelf 
in the corner. I asked why he had 
never told me he was kidnapped by 
terrorists. 
“I don’t like the word terrorist.” 
In the few weeks I 
had spent talking to 
George about the 
significant details 
of his life, he had 
never mentioned 
being kidnapped. 

George sighed. “I was abducted, I 
guess it was a kidnapping. It was only 
thirty-five hours. I don’t know if I’d 
call them terrorists. It was very short. 
I would never ever put myself in the 
very unlucky number of people who 
were held for a long time. I was never 
tortured, they treated me very well.” It 
was an uncomfortable subject and he 
was visibly upset when he told me the 
extremist was killed a week later. 

K

Hebrank 
started 
working at IRIS eight 
months before George took 
over 
as 
executive 
director, 
and has known him since he 
interviewed for the job. “From 
the beginning,” Hebrank said, 
“he made the impression of 
having energy.” She explained 
to me that the general attitude 
at IRIS had been that because 
immigration 
was 
highly 
controversial, they would work 
diligently, but quietly. George 
changed that. Though George 
had complained to me earlier 
about the elimination of a no-
press policy, he was the one who 
had gotten rid of it. “Before 
Chris,” Hebrank said, “If I said 
I worked at IRIS, nobody knew what I 
was talking about.” 

I asked Hebrank if she knew him 
outside of the office. She laughed and 
said, “We work a lot.”

L
ater that day, George met with 
me in a small side room down 
the hall because two of his colleagues 
were having a phone conference in 
his office. George told me he wished 
IRIS had money for a larger building 
because they don’t have enough office 
space. Their last building, he said, was 
about a quarter this size. There was 
only enough room for their desks and 
virtually no room for meeting spaces 
for the refugees. We were in one of 
the meeting rooms for refugees, which 
has cinderblock walls, and George was

sitting at a white plastic table with 
folding chairs. He told me that he 
always makes a point of mentioning 
Montclair, New Jersey. “It really did 
have a formative impact on my life,” 
George said. “It’s why I’m doing what 
I’m doing now.”  

George’s mother, a former nurse, 
and his father, a former broadcast 
journalist at ABC, moved to Montclair 
when George was in the third grade. 
His classmates called the their home 
the “mad scientist house,” because it 
was giant and broken-down, believed 
to be haunted. Since George was 
eight, he would come home from 
school and work for hours, fixing it up 
with his father.
In 1972, during the town’s racial 
desegregation of high schools, George 
was bussed from the white to the black 
part of town for school. Navigating 
racial tension was an early practice for 
cross-cultural understanding, and it 
made him develop an appreciation for 
diversity and tolerance.
George studied history and 
anthropology at the University of 
Pennsylvania , where he met his wife, 
Elizabeth, during the first week of 
school. After graduation, he joined 
the Peace Corps in 1997, assigned 
to volunteer in Oman. Elizabeth 
initially planned on staying in the 
US to pursue a career in art. “After a 
few months of desert in the Arabian 
Peninsula, we decided we did not like 
being apart.” George said. “Oman 
is a very conservative country. The 
only way she could come was if we 
got married.” They both traveled 
to Cyprus, where they married in 
1978. Elizabeth went back to Oman 
with him and worked as a darkroom 
technician in George’s office. 
“Montclair was my formative 
experience. For my children, it was 
growing up in the West Bank,” George 
said, referring to his stint there for 
Save the Children Foundation. The 
oldest is an associate producer for 
NPR. She has produced stories in 
Iraq, Egypt, and in Libya during the 
fall of Gadhafi. George’s second child 
is twenty-four and works in Sierra 
Leon as a Peace Corps volunteer. His 
youngest studied drama at the Tisch 
School of the Arts at New York 
University, from which he recently 
graduated. 

After two years in the Peace Corps, 
George returned to Philadelphia, 
working as a plumber, bartender, and 
substitute teacher. In 1982, George left 
for Lebanon, working with Quakers in 
housing reconstruction in Lebanese 
villages and refugee camps until 1984. 
In 1985, George began working as 
a director of the Save the Children 
Foundation, and in 1986 became 
Director of the Left Bank in Gaza. He 
worked with Save the Children for nine 
years. He spent the first half of that 
time in the West Bank in Gaza, and 
the second half at the organization’s 
headquarters in Westport, Conn. After 
the kidnapping in 1989, Chris stayed 
for another year before moving back 
to work as the Acting Director for the 
Middle East Region.  After leaving 
the organization in 1994, he became 
director of the Middle East division of 
Human Rights Watch until 1996. For 
the next four years after that, he was a 
director of the United States Agency 
for 
International 
Development’s 
legislative strengthening project with 
the Palestinian Parliament. Then, for 
three years on a USAID contract, 
George ran an organization that gave 
grants to Palestinian non-profits. 
From 2003 to 2004, he did volunteer 
work, consulting, and writing in 
Connecticut on legislative issues. 
George has been at IRIS since 2005.
George has gone back and forth 
from the US to the Middle East for 
the last twenty-five years. “You get 
stuck,” he told me, “Whether you like 
it or not, the jobs you’re qualified for 
are in the Middle East.” But George 
didn’t just get stuck. He has chosen 
to work in one of the most politically, 
religiously, and economically sensitive 
areas in the world.

T
he family of seven from Darfur 
had arrived at an apartment a 
few blocks away from a synagogue 
the night before we met them. Several 
women from the synagogue had 
volunteered to help them, and had 
spent the last week gathering dishware 
and utensils, arranging the furniture, 
and gathering clothes. The women 
had arrived earlier, and George was 
coming to welcome the family and 
bring donations. George meets with 
every refugee IRIS works with.
The apartment was the left half 
of a white two-story house in the 
Westville neighborhood of New 
Haven. A woman from the synagogue 
stood on the porch as the others 
grabbed the dinner from their car. 
George knocked on the door, and a 
tall, dark, thin man with a moustache 
stepped out. He was excited to see 
George, and they began to speak in 
Arabic. They smiled, and the man 
welcomed us inside.  

The family fled from Darfur 
to Egypt in 2006. The two youngest 
daughters, five-year-old Mariam and 
two-year-old Aya, had never seen 
Darfur. That’s how long it can take for 
a family of refugees to resettle in the 
United States. 

The living room had hardwood 
floors and was nearly empty except 
for a sofa and a small bookshelf. 
A tall woman wearing a long dress 
stood by the kitchen door, and a small 
child poked his head from behind 
her. George spoke with the woman, 
and then leaned into the next room, 
speaking English. The thirteen-year-
old son, Badreldin, also spoke English, 
and George encouraged him to come 
out and say hello. Small and skinny, 
he slowly walked to the women. One 
of the women from the synagogue 
pulled a picture dictionary from a bag. 
He showed it to his mother, and she 
smiled. 

George spoke with the man in

Arabic, pointing at the floor then at a 
table. Finally, the man pointed to the 
floor. George motioned to me and I 
followed him outside to the back of 
his Jeep 4x4. “We’re going to bring 
the TV inside.” We lifted it together 
and brought it to where the man had 
pointed. One of the volunteers was 
giving the wife a bag of food they 
had prepared for them. On each of 
the plastic containers, there was the 
name of the dish in English and then 
Arabic; one of the women from the 
synagogue had used Google Translate 
to make labels. After everything was 
brought into the home, the couple 
walked us to the door and thanked us 
again. The husband shook hands with 
George. 

A
s George drove me back home, 
I asked him what he had been 
saying to the family in Arabic. He said, 
little things, like where to put the TV, 
introducing the women, telling them 
they brought food. We were silent 
for a moment, and George said that 
they use the immigrant integration 
experience as a blueprint for refugee 
resettlement. It’s a difficult process, 
but it’s always that way. His job was just 
to make them self-sufficient, because 
IRIS doesn’t have enough resources 
to take care of them indefinitely. IRIS 
resettles them, and the refugees take 
care of themselves. It is the American 
Dream: self-reliance, hard work, 
pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. 
“My 
grandfather 
an 
immigrant,” 
George 
said. 
His 
grandfather’s last name was originally 
Georgacopoulis. “It makes us proud 
and strong. That’s how it is in America. 
It’s very rare to say ‘He didn’t make 
it.’” 

I asked about the missing Iraqi 
roommate. George explained that the 
man, who has since moved back to the 
US, had flown to the Middle East to 
try to meet with his family in Jordan. 
But George wasn’t sure what he would 
be going back to. I asked if the man’s 
leaving like that was discouraging, 
but George responded stoically that 
it rarely happens. For a second, I 
thought I saw a look of defeat as 
George sighed and watched his 
boulder roll back down the mountain. 
But it was only a second. I knew that 
whether it was at IRIS or anywhere 
else, George will always roll it back 
up again. George was expecting six 
refugees from Eritrea that needed 
an apartment, food, clothes, and 
tutors to teach them English. His 
refugees needed health insurance, 
George returns a phone call in his office. 
food stamps, social security numbers, 
and help filling out job applications. 
They needed to learn where to buy 
groceries, that squirrels are not rats, 
that dogs are not wild animals, and 
that joggers aren’t running away from 
anything. There is nothing routine 
about refugee resettlement.
