EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Sometime during the second or 
third week of your publishing in­
ternship, your boss swivels away 
from her monitor and asks, “How do 
you feel about romance?”
You don’t feel anything anymore. 
You have been photocopying foreign 
contracts for days, and this has made 
you numb. Peering meekly from be­
hind a fortress of overstuffed manila 
files, you repeat, inanely, “Romance?”
Her gaze has already returned to her 
email. “Yeah. Regency.”
You do feel something about 
this genre; some might call it “antipa­
thy.” While you grope for the words 
to express that romance is not, um, 
your favorite thing, a ream of paper 
is dumped into your arms, still warm 
from the office printer. Someone’s 
baby. Your first client manuscript.


On the commute, put aside your 
pious Anna Karenina and pull out 
the Regency romance. Your mouth is 
grim. You’ll find that within the first 
two chapters, the duke senses that he 
could come to love this impudent chit, 
and though she thinks him a cold-
hearted rake, she feels an unwilling at­
traction. They collide on a windswept 
moor outside the estate. An ankle 
gets twisted, a skirt ruined, and they 
fall muddily into each others’ arms. 
Gently, he tilts her face up. They kiss, 
their horses looking on approvingly. 
Throughout, you make broad notes 
in the margins in red ink, punctuated 
by gleeful underlines and spluttering 
question marks. Fly through the story, 
rifling through until at last you turn 
over the final page, look out the win­
dow, and see the parking lot of your 
stop.


Your instructions are simple: 
write up a brief summary and analy­
sis. Always lead with the verdict—do 
you recommend this manuscript for 
acceptance? Explain your reasoning. 
Make suggestions, providing quotes 
and citing page numbers. And be nice: 
this person might be our client, so 
there’s no point in being nasty. The 
agent might want to use your critiques 
in their editorial notes. Sternly, your 
supervisor warns that a reader’s report 
is not supposed to be beautiful prose.


Re-read your notes. Reluctantly 
rein in the snark. The villain’s revenge 
scheme is confusing, you opine, and 
he could probably kidnap the lady 
without stealing the identity of a dead 
naval officer and blackmailing a saucy 
tavern wench. The banter between the 
lovers needs to be cut in half. And per­
haps the word “sexy” should be used 
more sparingly, given the novel’s his­
torical setting. 


In the spirit of “being nice,” 
write how you enjoyed the archery 
scenes and many of the supporting 
characters, which is true—you’re a 
sucker for a precocious little sister or 
an unexpectedly-progressive dowager. 
Swaddle your critiques in qualifiers, 
padding each sentence with a “per­
haps” or a “sometimes.” Before hit­
ting send, add, “Improvements could 
be made to the relationship’s pace. It 
develops a little too quickly.”


This represents an upgrade from 
your first days at the office, in 
which you wrestled with the type­
writer, played gopher, pushed paper. 
You can’t believe this office has a 
typewriter. Your tour of the extensive 
and color-coded files (“Interns often 
find it helpful to draw a map,” your 
supervisor suggests) ends at the intern 
desk, where the slush pile of unsolic­
ited queries is contained—for now—
in the large drawer to your left. You 
flick through the envelopes, which are 
stamped with earnestly excessive post­
age. The oldest has languished for a 
month and a half. This pleases your 
supervisor. “We’re pretty ahead!” she 
remarks cheerfully.


Your job is to bump the hope­
fuls from this particular ring of pur­
gatory, sorting them into Yeses, Nos, 
and Maybes. Your boss will check your 
work, but she provides some helpful 
guidelines: historical fiction should be 
pegged to immediately recognizable 
figures and events, or else it doesn’t 
sell. A thriller should elevate your 
heart-rate by the tenth or fifteenth 
page, or else it doesn’t sell. Nonfic­
tion should have a platformed author, 
or else it doesn’t sell. Literary fiction 
doesn’t sell. 


What does sell is romance, ap­
proximately $1.368 billion of it per 
year.


Interns generally come up with a 
40:60 ratio of nos to yeses and may­
bes, your supervisor informs you, but 
eventually your ratio should shift to 
70:30. Smile. She underestimates your 
ruthlessness.


For your part, you have underes­
timated the lengths to which people 
will go to secure an agent: the sample 
chapters painstakingly bound in plas­
tic covers, the mix CDs and original 
soundtracks, the occasional, perplex­
ing headshot. Your supervisor sees fit 
to mention that the agency doesn’t ac­
cept anyone who sends hand-written 
letters. Or anyone in prison. These 
additional rules eliminate more manila 
than you’d expect. 


The next manuscript lands you 
back in bodice-ripping England, 
with another eligible earl, another 
ravishing young debutante. Anna Kar­
enina is deadweight in your backpack 
on your daily speed-walk through 
Midtown.


Over time you gather a vast lexi­
con of the tics of Romance, but in­
explicably, you’re immune to irritation. 
As you encounter them, you greet 
these clichés like old friends: child­
hood 
friends-turned-lovers, 
ladies 
compromised on balconies, yawning 
gambling debts, deranged kidnap­
pings in the final act. Eventually you 
graduate to other worlds: Gilded Age, 
steampunk, super-hero. A nonfiction 
proposal and mystery cross your desk, 
but do not break your stride.


This is how the genre does so 
well—its readers want comfort, not 
novelty, and they will return again 
and again for the minute yet endless 
variations which each story can offer. 
There’s a subgenre for everyone, each 
a thriving fiefdom unto itself: urban 
fantasy and paranormal, suspense and 
small-town, inspirational (i.e., Chris­
tian) and erotic, historical and “eth­
nic.” There are even series centered 
on characters’ professions, like “Har­
lequin Medical Romance” or “Stories 
set in the World of NASCAR.” Ro­
mances can be consumed in fistfuls, 
like M&Ms, a habit enabled by the 
e-reader, which razed the biggest bar­
riers to consumption: embarrassment 
and difficulty of access. These books 
are priced to entice the impulse buyer: 
$5.99, $4.99, with a novella tossed in 
for free. In the digital age, no one has 
to wait for another fix. You are getting 
the raw stuff.


Abruptly, you’re given a “special 
project”: a full manuscript that 
had been sitting in the inbox for a few 
months. Not a romance.


It’s good. The beginning is messy. 
Its seams show. The scenes are layered 
in a way that makes the pace groan for­
ward by inches. But the characters are 
alive, and for the first time that sum­
mer, you sit on the train and re-read a 
line, just to feel it hit you again. It’s al­
ways difficult to articulate why you like 
a given piece of art; it’s even harder 
when it’s not quite art yet. People talk 
a lot about love, but liking something 
is its own weirdly strong feeling. You 
think this story will speak to someone. 
You think it speaks to you.


You heartily recommend it for 
acceptance.


Despite yourself, you’re a little in 
love.


If the publishing industry has been 
gutted, no one has told the writers. 
Each day brings a fresh batch of query 
letters to add to the slush. The writers 
introduce themselves and their writing 
backgrounds, tell you about their fam­
ilies and hobbies. A speed date where 
you have all the power.


Occasionally it may occur to 
you—briefly, horrifyingly—that you 
are more likely to take a chance on a 
sweet query than any of the real live 
human romantic prospects of your re­
cent past. Ignore this. 


Doggedly chip at the slush pile. 
It’s cathartic to clear out the desk, 
though you hold out hope that you’ll 
find something. Fish out a few pro­
posals that look promising, nervously 
turning them over for inspection. 
Your supervisor rifles through, look­
ing deeply unimpressed, though she 
says she’ll take a look at them soon.


“From now on,” she adds, “You 
can just send out your rejections. You 
don’t have to run them by me. All of 
your nos have been spot-on.”


Not so much with your yeses, but 
damned if you will stop trying. In the 
last week, you feel like you’ve hit a vein 
of gold. In the slush pile, you pull out 
three or four decent options: a mem­
oir or two, a dystopian road novel, a 
New England woman’s fiction which, 
if you squint at it right, could conceiv­
ably be an Oprah’s Book Club pick. 
You are willing to overlook almost all 
faults. Their mistakes will be caught by 
the agent, or in editorial. Anything can 
be fixed. You are desperate for variety.


Yet in your heart, you know that 
if you saw these books in a bookshop, 
you can’t imagine you’d look twice. 
Wonder if, in the publishing world, 
you’ve become a whore with a heart 
of gold.


In an e-mail, a writer friend com­
plains about some “love story for 
adults” she’s been duped into trying, 
a bestseller far more up-market than 
anything resting on your bedside table. 
She jokes, “Do you ever get that fear 
that if you read enough bad prose it’ll 
get trapped in your ear, and you’ll start 
writing it? Horror of horrors!” 


Actually, you fear that you’ve 
forgotten how to read. After four se­
mesters of high-fiber, nutrient-dense 
hits of the literary canon, you had 
become a vocal advocate for cultural 
omnivorism. These days, you feel your 
slush diet eroding your palate, your 
appetite, your metabolism.


Painfully bore through your great 
Russian novel, never gaining enough 
momentum to absorb the text. You 
begin to resent the physical heaviness 
of it, just as an object. When it falls 
off your lap on the train, you wake 
with a start. Picking it up, imagine typ­
ing up a few recommendations for 
Tolstoy, in that peculiarly sunny voice 
you’ve come to own. “While I found 
the characters sympathetic (particu­
larly Anna and Kitty!) the novel has 
a few major structural problems with 
regards to its pace. While the inter­
related cast of characters is balanced 
deftly, the prose takes lengthy detours 
into farming practices and party vot­
ing procedures, and these grow some­
what dry at times. The book might 
also benefit from more fleshed-out 
and explicit scenes between Anna and 
Vronsky. As it stands, the interlude 
marked by the ellipse in Part One feels 
jarring and dissatisfying, especially 
since such ellipses do not occur else­
where in the book. It feels accidental, 
then coy.” 


Consider throwing yourself off 
the Aberdeen-Matawan platform as 
penance.


The manuscript you were rooting 
for is nixed. With terrible kind­
ness, your supervisor deems the novel 
unfixable: too much narrative distance, 
confusing chronology. You’re not sure 
what “narrative distance” means, but 
you swallow her explanation. 


It’s a heart-breaker. She asks that 
you draft a form rejection, with a nice 
note to say that the agency would 
be happy to look at future work, the 
agency equivalent of “I don’t think 
this will work out, but I hope we can 
still be friends.” 


On the 6:31 p.m. express out 
of Penn Station, entertain yourself 
by spying on your fellow passengers. 
This is the summer of Fifty Shades of 
Grey. You are impressed by any novel 
that threatens to unseat Angry Birds 
as the commuter’s diversion of choice. 
They can’t hide from you, these young 
women folding back the paper cover, 
the businessmen hunched surrepti­
tiously over their Kindles.


Like everyone else, develop opin­
ions on the book without having ac­
tually read it—its deadening prose, its 
Cinderella story so weirdly evacuated 
of eroticism—but your feelings lack 
the same bile. Honestly, you’re just a 
little bit dazzled. Who are you to ar­
gue with a book that has earned $50 
million for its author in six months? 
The people have spoken. It sells. And 
it sells film rights, soundtracks, and 
condoms. 


Good romance novels are all 
alike; every bad romance novel is 
bad in its own way. Keep reading the 
manuscripts as they roll in. You have 
become a mechanic of baroque Rube 
Goldberg machines, the characters 
spinning like sawtooth gears and ex­
traneous plots rattling cheerfully, wait­
ing for your tightening wrench, a little 
extra weight. You work with what you 
have. It soothes you to take a look un­
der the hood and make it right, so that 
after an hour or so you can step back 
and say, “It ain’t pretty, but it’ll get you 
from Point A to Point B.” 


The end of the summer leaves 
you ambivalent about the book busi­
ness. After months on the inside, you 
have come to understand the alien­
ation that aspiring writers feel from 
the publishing industry — their sense 
that the gatekeepers’ choices are so in­
scrutable and idiosyncratic that they’re 
essentially arbitrary. You made your 
choices, guided by well-meaning men­
tors, according to prevailing industry 
logic. But you know the imperative 
to sell lucrative schlock in order to fi­
nance the elusive gem would eventu­
ally grind you down.


Finish your Tolstoy, which ends, 
to your surprise, not with Anna in 
the wheels but Levin under the stars. 
Don’t read at all for a few days.
