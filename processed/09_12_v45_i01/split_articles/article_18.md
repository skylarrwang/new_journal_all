In the summer of 1978, North Haven resident Nancy Alderman and her husband were woken up nightly by a terrible smell wafting through the open windows of their home. One night her husband Myles got in the car to follow the stench to its source. He ended up at the chemical plant of the pharmaceutical manufacturing firm Upjohn, in front of over one hundred smokestacks and vents. “It was two miles from our house, but I had no idea it existed,” Nancy Alderman told me over lunch. The plant was located on the banks of the Quinnipiac River, which would later provide a home for her environmental nonprofit—the Quinnipiac River Fund.


In many ways, the history of the Quinnipiac River Fund mirrors its namesake’s trajectory. Though at its source farther north, the river is a small brook, hardly visible on an aerial map, the river-mouth is impressive—a wide, dock-lined corridor crowded with lobster boats and spanned by a number of heavily-traveled bridges.  The Quinnipiac River Fund asks people to re-imagine their waters.
