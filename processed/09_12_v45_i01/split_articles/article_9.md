players 
found 
they 
had 
fewer 
economic opportunities. They were 
annoyed by their new limitations, and 
didn’t understand why they should 
bear the price of an earlier generation’s 
mistakes. But that’s precisely the 
point: “Generations” works so that 
players are chosen for, choosing for 
themselves, and choosing for others. 
The biggest difference between 
“Generations” and a real election is 
the absence of the party system in 
the game. “The candidates presented 
in the game are randomly chosen, so 
there’s more variation,” Logan notes. 
“But the game reflects our actual 
political tradeoffs between short-term 
and long-term interests.” 
Logan 
perceives 
two 
broad 
groups of players: “mechanical” and 
“principled.” 
Mechanical 
are determined to maximize their 
individual outcomes, while principled 
players advance a particular ideology 
even to their own detriment. This 
second 
group 
“becomes 
very 
emotionally attached to the outcome 
of the game,” while the first group 
seems to stay cooler and detached, 
Logan said. Politically opinionated or 
partisan players do not necessarily fall 
into the second group. 
Logan is Canadian by birth and 
retains only a hint of an accent in the 
way he says “about.” His enthusiasm 
for his native country’s politics shows 
in the game, for example, in the 
cards that offer a player the chance 
to purchase plush health insurance. 
Logan freely admits the game reflects 
his political inclinations—if voters 
followed principle rather than self-
interest, they’d come to support the 
social democratic policies that he 
favors and believes realize everyone’s 
long-term interests. The principled 
player will eventually make the best 
choice, which, for Logan, means a 
social democratic agenda.
For 
this 
fall’s 
Republican 
candidate Mitt Romney, the “best 
choice” relies on entirely different 
assumptions, but his campaign now 
seems to share Logan’s logic. He has 
specifically addressed the mechanical 
voter, asking individuals whether they 
are better off than they were four years 
ago. His campaign has hammered 
away at the public perception of the 
state of the economy in the hope of 
implicating President Barack Obama 
by association. This approach reflects 
a dominant view in social science that 
economic performance predicts the 
outcome of presidential elections.
Forecasting 
models 
largely 
Journal. Will this new, ideological 
rhetoric appeal beyond his party’s own 
base?
It’s difficult to predict how 
appealing to voters’ ideologies will 
work out in the real elections, but the 
board game suggests Romney’s tactic 
may be a smart one. One of Logan’s 
most interesting observations suggests 
that even without parties, voters will 
still behave ideologically rather than 
self-interestedly. The question is, do 
this election’s undecided voters—the 
mystical 6 to 8 percent, according 
to Gallup’s daily tracking poll—
vote like the non-partisan players of 
“Generations”? Are undecided voters 
simply principled non-partisans, or, 
are they lost souls, unsure of what is 
mechanically best for them?
Polls consistently show that a 
large majority of Americans feel the 
country is on the “wrong track” and 
worry that their children’s generation 
will be worse off than they are. Uneasy 
feelings, of course, don’t coalesce into 
votes on their own. It takes a narrative 
to interpret and give coherence to 
voters’ confusion. In elections like 
the upcoming November’s, there 
is opportunity for that narrative to 
recreate itself every few months. In 
the elections of “Generations,” voters’ 
decisions are made only minutes apart.
