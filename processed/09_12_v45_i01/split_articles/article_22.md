A Conversation with 
David Samuels
The New York Times called David 
Samuels “an elite narrative journalist, a 
master at teasing out the social and moral 
implications of  the smallest small talk.” 
He is a contributing editor at Harper’s 
Magazine and writes for The New 
Yorker and The Atlantic. He sat down 
with The New Journal at Theresa’s Polish 
Restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, where he 
lives with his two children.
The New Journal: You write on a sort 
of rotation between Harper’s Magazine, 
The New Yorker, and The Atlantic. How 
does that approach inform your work?
David Samuels: At this point these 
places have all become like different 
instruments that are available to me. 
Do I want to play the guitar? What 
kind of guitar? The violin? I get 
flexibility and pleasure from being 
able to play different instruments 
in different places. Without entirely 
meaning to, I ended up with some real 
mastery of this very specific form – 
the long American magazine article. It 
ain’t Shakespeare’s plays or the grand 
19th century novel. On the other hand 
it’s the one indigenous American 
literary form, and it strikes me as 
having no more or no less absolute 
literary potential than the sestina, say.
TNJ: You recently wrote an article for 
Harper’s about a strange undercurrent 
of racism – a sort of desire to 
eliminate the messiness of the real 
world – at the Bronx Zoo. Talk about 
your process with that piece.
DS: If there’s a human value that I’m 
trying to get across in my work, it’s 
about an integration of thinking and 
feeling where feeling comes first.
Part of what I want readers to 
take from my work is the value of not 
knowing everything in advance, and 
not thinking that you do.  Another 
part is the willingness and ability to 
be emotionally and intellectually open 
without feeling superior. I think that 
those values are largely absent from 
the culture of smart people who went 
to good universities who pretend to 
know all this stuff they actually have 
very limited real-world experience of. 
That sense of entitlement to 
the experience of others has always 
rubbed me the wrong way, in part 
because I’m not a person who has a 
lot of confidence in my knowledge 
of things I haven’t seen or felt. The 
inherent assumption that I belonged 
to a common milieu with the people 
I went to school with, was the source 
of a lot of pain and anger for me in 
the course of my own Ivy League 
education and afterwards, because I 
never actually felt like I belonged, or 
like I wanted to belong. I think I’ve 
found a relatively sophisticated way to 
express that hurt and that anger, but 
that is still the underlying animus of 
my work.  So I have always trusted 
to this process of serendipity when I 
choose subjects.
With the zoo piece, I was going 
through a rough time in my life. I felt 
my marriage come apart, and I had 
two children who I loved very much. 
One of the ways I dealt with this was 
to take my son to the zoo. It was a big 
strange park with tigers and giraffes in 
the middle of the Bronx, and it was a 
form of escape that I could share with 
my child. But there’s something weird 
about looking at all these animals 
in cages. Why do I want to do that? 
What am I really showing him about 
the world, and about me? What is 
this communication about and how 
creepy is it that I’m doing this? I didn’t 
understand it.  I just had these feelings 
about it.

TNJ: What finally led you to see the 
weirdness in the zoo?
DS: I was sitting in the zoo library, 
which took about three months for 
them to get me access to. The second 
or third day, I noticed this creepy 
oil portrait of a handsome man 
with a mustache peering at me from 
between some bookshelves. His name 
was Madison Grant. I discovered 
that he was the leading racist of 
early 20th-century America and the 
sort of godfather of eugenics and 
immigration restrictions. He also was 
the creator of the zoo and ran it for 
forty years. Suddenly I was like “Oh, 
the Bronx Zoo was founded by one 
of the more evil people to live in 20th 
century America.” He was also deeply 
involved with the racist German 
scientists who set up Auschwitz. So I 
realized that there was something very 
dark that was woven into the history 
and conception of this place—but it 
took a long time to find that thread. 
All I had to go on was what I felt and 
the fact that I wasn’t willing to allow 
my purely rational faculties to shut 
off what I was actually feeling in that 
place.
TNJ: How do you feel about the state 
of magazine journalism today?
DS: I believe the catastrophe has 
already happened. The magazine 
world I entered almost twenty years 
ago was a broad, commercially-viable 
industry with a long and distinguished 
history. For a reasonably large 
audience of people, it was a fun way to 
spend two hours in the afternoon, as 
an alternative to TV and other forms 
of entertainment. That world is gone. 
And yet in some ways, I feel 
more optimistic about the form now 
that the world I grew up with is gone. 
I can look at the form now and feel 
that things are changing -- that’s 
there’s going to be a marriage of the 
technology and the form I grew up 
with that may be even better in its mix 
of creative potential and audience and 
money. Long-form non-fiction, or 
literary journalism, or whatever you 
call it has been a vital American form 
for 150 years, and it’s already survived 
a number of technological shifts. 
Each time, the form has become more 
robust. 
TNJ: You come from an orthodox 
Jewish background. How does that 
background affect your observations 
of American culture?
DS: The Jewishness of my work is 
inherent in the posture I take and in 
my choices of subjects. I’m the first 
American in my family. I have the 
intensity of interest in American life 
of a typical first-generation immigrant. 
It’s like Bernard Malamud’s novel The 
Natural. He’s as Jewish a writer as there 
is, and yet he writes this great baseball 
novel that doesn’t have anything 
overtly Jewish in it at all. In some 
sense, the intensity of his imagination 
of The Natural depended on his feeling 
that the thing that he was imagining 
was radically other what he was – 
something marvelous and strange 
and threatening. I think that a similar 
sense of distance and identification 
characterizes all my writing about 
America. Barack Obama’s not me; 
Mitt Romney’s not me; Kanye West’s 
not me. I find emotional resonances 
in all my subjects but there’s a distance 
there that comes from the fact that 
I’m situated elsewhere. When I think 
of myself in the larger sweep of some 
historical continuity, I think of myself 
as a writer first, and I think of myself 
as a Jew.
