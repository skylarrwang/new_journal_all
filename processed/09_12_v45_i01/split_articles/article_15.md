the school, which is now a National 
Historic Landmark. Jonathan Kreiss-
Tomkins ’12, who grew up in Sitka, 
invited Yalies to join in the effort for 
the summer through a program called 
Bulldogs on Baranof Island.

This summer, as I watched many 
of my friends begin their working 
lives—as teachers, analysts, activists, 
journalists, law students—I couldn’t 
help but compare my own form of 
work to theirs. What was manual 
labor teaching me? What was 
I accomplishing? And what 
did it mean for an Ivy League 
graduate to choose to install 
insulation all day? 

Two years ago, after a 
series of jobs on farms, I was 
certain that I wanted to be a 
farmer. I loved the work and 
thought it held important 
value for society. I knew that 
I preferred working actively 
with my body, hands, and 
mind (even as a summer 
camp dishwasher) to writing 
emails, making spreadsheets, 
and spending the entire day 
behind a computer screen. 

But as I begin the process of 
building a career and working 
life, I’ve begun to worry that 
to choose to farm would be to 
shirk the responsibilities of my degree 
in some crucial way. 
Though 
I 
have 
long 
held 
physical work to be an important 
part of education, I have come to 
distrust the rhetoric of “fulfillment,” 
“satisfaction,” and “good work” that 
dominates many conversations about 
the value of elite students engaging 
in manual labor. In an attempt to 
clarify my own thoughts, I decided 
to ask these questions to other Yalies 
who had chosen to join the Sheldon 
Jackson work crew or had spent 
time doing manual work elsewhere. 
Their 
answers 
were 
thoughtful, 
varied, surprising, and illuminating, 
and resonated deeply with my own 
attempts to define education and 
ethical work over the past four years.

A
laska is a place that people run 
away to. In Into the Wild, John 
Krakauer writes, “Alaska has long 
been a magnet for dreamers and 
misfits, people who think the unsullied 
enormity of the Last Frontier will patch 
all the holes in their lives.” Though 
my six-week sojourn to the city of 
Sitka in the mild, misty southeast isn’t 
comparable to Chris McCandless’s 
fatal journey into the Alaska bush, 
I share some of the idealism and 
escapism that made McCandless such 
a controversial figure. I like doing 
manual work because I lose myself in 
it. These humble tasks have their own 
unsullied enormity. Call it therapeutic, 
call it lazy, but I enjoy pulling up 
weeds for hours or sanding beams all 
day. There is an element of escapism 
in conducting hard physical labor—
but it also cultivates its own life of the 
mind. We discovered that the mind 
and body aren’t so separate after all.

n May 2009 when I read Michael B. 
Crawford’s New York Times Magazine 
article “The Case for Working 
With Your Hands,” it electrified 
me. Crawford traces his journey 
from political philosophy Ph.D. to 
motorcycle repairman and, along 
the way, makes the argument that 
concrete work has an intellectual and 
ethical dimension sorely lacking in our 
information-age economy. Concrete 
work, he writes, “answers to a basic 
human need of the one who does it.” 
Meanwhile, the country’s relentless 
focus on “mind work” and 
higher 
education 
(at 
an 
increasingly 
astronomical 
cost to students, I might add) 
is not serving its citizens’ 
minds or morals. Working 
with one’s hands cultivates 
“individual 
responsibility” 
in a way that abstract work 
never can. He wrote of “an 
ethic of paying attention that 
develops in the trades through 
hard experience.” According 
to Crawford, not only was my 
individual integrity at stake, 
but the fate of my community 
as well: “Work forms us, and 
deforms us,” he warned, “with 
broad public consequences.”

After a freshman year 
spent shuttling between the 
library, where I scrambled 
to keep up with my Directed Studies 
workload, and dorm rooms on Old 
Campus, where I scrambled to keep 
up with my classmates’ drinking 
habits, Crawford’s essay articulated 
much of the dissatisfaction I felt 
with my education and my lifestyle. 
I’d always been most comfortable 
when making things, whether it was a 
knit hat, a clean room, or a wooden 
box. Yet I struggled to find a way to 
connect that tactile form of thinking 
and production to the work that Yale 
assigned and valued. That summer 
I interned at the Yale Sustainable 
Food Project, and spent seven hours 
a day seeding, weeding, planting and 
harvesting. I had never been happier.

Many students’ reflections on the 
work crew echo Crawford’s reasoning. 
Again and again they returned to 
words like “concrete,” “tangible,” and 
“satisfying.” Manual work like painting, 
sanding or taking off a roof felt real 
in a way that schoolwork often didn’t. 
Omar Dairanieh ’13 spent two months 
in SJC’s central auditorium, Richard 
H. Allen Memorial Hall, before 
the rest of the work crew arrived, 
leveling floors for dance studios and 
painting brackets. The work, he said, 
“was exhausting and backbreaking, 
but it was extremely rewarding. I 
actually got to see a huge differences 
in the building; there was noticeable, 
concrete proof of the work I was 
doing.” This stood in stark contrast to 
his experience as a history major. “I 
spent the last three years at Yale taking 
theory-heavy courses that all came to 
similar conclusions: nothing is real or 
stable or relevant,” Dairanieh said. “As 
challenging and as interesting as that 
critical approach may be, it was also 
really disenchanting.” His experience 
in Alaska was therapeutic, he said, 
and allowed him to re-engage in the 
material world. Manual labor reminded 
him that “things exist. It seems simple, 
but it was extremely reassuring.”

The reality of repetitive manual 
work forced me to slow down, to be 
patient in a way I rarely had to be 
at Yale. Roger Schmidt, director of 
Alaska Arts Southeast and organizer 
of this summer’s volunteer work, 
said that one of the main differences 
between concrete and abstract work is 
the amount of time it takes, with the 
former more time-consuming than 
the latter. Some students had a hard 
time getting used to the difference.  Ira 
Slomski-Pritz ’14 found the repetitive 
motions of painting and sanding 
unenjoyable. “I felt useful because I 
knew these things had to be done and 
this was helpful to the campus, but I 
don’t think that given a choice and if 
I had more skills I would see much 
value in going back and doing those 
jobs.”

I was the kind of child who, 
when asked to name her favorite 
activity, answered, “unloading the 
dishwasher.” I have always found 
focus and enjoyment in repetitive 
work. One of the projects I worked 
on in Allen was sanding tall, laminated 
cedar beams that stretched from the 
floor to the rafters. When I flipped 
the sander switch, I felt vibrations 
quiver up my arm, from fingertips 
to shoulder. I pressed it to the wood 
and swept the machine in circles. 
Slowly, the blackened surface of the 
beam wore away to reveal an amber 
cedar grain. I worked across the 
beam horizontally, then up vertically, 
circling and circling, making my way 
up the ladder rung by rung. Little piles 
of sawdust gathered on the floor and 
stacks of worn sandpaper grew on the 
worktable. After about half an hour 
my arm was sore, but as I worked
