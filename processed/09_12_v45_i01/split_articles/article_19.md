bridges. The Quinnipiac River Fund’s 
origins are similarly humble, but it 
is now a widely-recognized non-
profit that has financed countless 
environmental research and education 
projects. The non-profit’s existence, 
just like the cleaner water running 
in the Quinnipiac, is a testament 
to Alderman’s devotion to her 
surroundings. 

Her 
environmental 
work has created a community of 
researchers and activists who want 
to change how we interact with 
our landscape. As they continue to 
confront environmental abuses after 
three decades of service, they are 
hoping that helping people develop 
personal relationships with the river 
will encourage them to protect it as 
well. 

Alderman is a straight-talking 
New Englander, and she looks the part, 
with a penchant for thick sweaters and 
engaging eye-contact. She acquired a 
Master’s in Environmental Studies in 
1997 and also serves as the founder 
and president of Environment and 
Human Health, Inc., a Connecticut 
non-profit that researches the effect 
of environmental factors on our 
health. When she and her husband 
discovered the Upjohn plant, she was 
39 and had no such credentials. A stay-
at-home mom who dropped out of 
the Connecticut College for Women, 
she 
entered 
into 
activism as a layman and concerned 
citizen. “At that time, women didn’t 
work,” she told me. “They were meant 
to get married and have children. But 
they did volunteer work in a very 
serious way.” 

A large part of Alderman’s 
volunteer work took root in the days 
immediately following that night as 
she investigated what was going on 
inside the Upjohn factory. She tried to 
find out what kind of chemicals were 
causing the smell, but the managers 
of the factory rebuffed her. “What 
are they? They wouldn’t tell us. What 
are you making? Trade secret,” she 
said. Eventually she found that the 
company’s system of open-air waste 
management allowed the toxins she 
had smelled to be released into both the 
air and water. In 1978, she teamed up 
with the newly founded Connecticut 
Fund for the Environment (CFE), an 
environmental law group that aims 
to ensure that recent environmental 
legislation is enforced. Ignored by 
the local Upjohn administrators, 
Alderman and the founder of the 
CFE, Fred Krupp, took the fight to 
the national level. That meant buying 
enough shares of Upjohn to allow 
them to speak at the company’s annual 
General Meeting at its headquarters in 
Kalamazoo, Michigan. 

“There was no question it was 
David and Goliath,” Alderman said, 
and she worked hard to win the fight. 
After years spent working on the 
case, Alderman and Krupp had won 
the support of 123,680 shareholders, 
whose shares totaled “a market 
value of over seven and one half 
million dollars.” They were backed 
by the United Presbyterian Church 
of America, the City of New Haven 
pension funds, the Union Trust 
Company, which is the third largest 
bank in Connecticut, Yale University, 
and First Bank, she said.

On May 19, 1981, Alderman 
spoke at Upjohn’s annual General 
Meeting. I read a copy of the speech. 
Unexpectedly stirring, it incorporates 
her perspectives both as a shareholder 
of Upjohn and as a resident of North 
Haven. She referred to Upjohn as 
“our company” and to its policies as 
“our policies” while the Connecticut 
air and water remain “our air” and 
“our water” — despite the fact that 
the Quinnipiac River was hundreds 
of miles away from the Kalamazoo 
headquarters.  In front of the meeting 
attendees, she asked:

“How can The Upjohn 
Company expect to sell its 
pharmaceuticals to a trusting 
public when its chemical division 
is acting in such a secretive and 
arbitrary way? If our left hand 
is appearing to make people 
sick, how can we expect people 
to trust our right hand to make 
them well?”


The leaders of Upjohn were 
shocked. The meeting resulted in 
major changes: the North Haven plant 
was shut down, and the court case that 
the CFE and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council had brought against 
the company for not complying with 
its water permit was settled. Upjohn 
had to pay $1.2 million over the course 
of three years, money that established 
a permanent fund administered by the 
Community Foundation of Greater 
New Haven. What began with a 
chemical stench disturbing Alderman’s 
sleep grew into the Quinnipiac River 
Fund. 

Other aspects of the landscape 
of New Haven County bear 
subtle traces of Alderman’s work. 
The Farmington Canal Greenway, a 
recreational path that cuts through 
cities and forests between New 
Haven and Granby, Connecticut, 
on the Massachusetts border, owes 
its existence to her. In 1987, she 
banded with other members of 
her community to prevent a large 
mall from being built in Hamden, 
looking for anything on the site that 
might halt the construction. They 
were hoping for wetlands; instead, 
they found an abandoned railway. It 
followed the route of a canal where 
mules used to plod along a towpath, 
pulling boats towards Northampton. 
With some legal help, Alderman had 
a rail-to-trail project underway, which 
both prevented the building of the 
mall and created the Farmington 
Canal Greenway across the state of 
Connecticut. 

Through 
her 
non-profit 
Environment & Human Health, Inc., 
she has convinced schoolbus drivers 
to turn off their motors when they 
wait for kids, persuaded schools to 
stop using carcinogenic artificial turf, 
and completed the largest study of 
well water in the United States. But 
the project that has brought about the 
most long-term changes—and created 
the widest circle of activists—was 
her work that led to the founding of 
the “Q-River Fund,” as it’s lovingly 
nicknamed. 

My first glimpse of the Quinnipiac 
River was on a cool afternoon in early 
April. I had biked from downtown 
New Haven along Chapel Street, 
through the leafy neighborhood 
around 
Wooster 
Square, 
which 
morphed into towering mounds of 
gravel and sand beside dilapidated 
factories near the Mill River. As I 
crossed the drawbridge over the Mill, 
I saw white cylinders farther up the 
river. Then the industrial landscape 
gradually became abandoned-looking 
houses with faded vinyl siding and an 
enormous Mexican restaurant called 
Guadalupe La Poblanita, empty in the 
early afternoon. 

Coming over a little hill 
where Chapel becomes Front Street, I 
had seemingly crossed into an idyllic 
New England village: just beyond a 
stand of trees was the Quinnipiac 
River, its wide surface flecked with 
white caps, and beyond that a low 
green hill with a white spire. As I biked 
along Quinnipiac River Park, I looked 
at the Victorian houses across the 
river, ending at where Ian Christmann 
lives with his family.

Christmann is a photographer 
and part of Alderman’s community 
of activists. He received funding from 
the Quinnipiac River Fund to create a 
photography exhibit called “Consider 
the Quinnipiac” and in July turned it 
into an online gallery and virtual tour 
of the same name. The Quinnipiac 
River Fund tests water quality, 
measures soil erosion and quantifies 
invertebrate populations, but exists 
primarily to raise awareness about the 
river. 

In living and working along 
the Quinnipiac, Christmann has 
come to know the river intimately. 
He knows that five miles upstream 
it becomes quiet, with no boats, but 
much marshland and the occasional 
low bridge. He knows that half of 
the river’s length is tidal, and that 
fifteen to thirty million tires have 
been illegally dumped in the river near 
North Haven. He has photographed 
hundreds of secret moments of life 
along the river: a swan poking its head 
down into its stick-mound nest, a 
dusting of snow on the tugboats and 
docks, a fisherman looking out from 
the sleet-grey mountain of oyster 
shells on the deck of his boat. “Lots 
of people don’t know this area exists,” 
Christmann told me in his living room, 
which looks out over the Quinnipiac. 

Ironically, this landscape is what 
first attracted the Puritans who set up 
the colony that would become New 
Haven. In 1637, Boston businessman 
Theophilus Eaton received reports 
of “the rich and goodly meadows 
of Quinnipiack” from captains who 
were fighting off the Pequot tribe 
and who hoped that the English 
would capitalize on the river before 
the Dutch did. After visiting the site, 
Eaton sent word to his schoolfriend 
John Davenport that he had no trouble 
imagining it as “a thriving Wilderness 
Zion,” as Rollin G. Osterweis puts 
it in Three Centuries of  New Haven. 
Davenport arrived one year later with 
500 followers. 

Christmann’s 
online 
gallery 
outlines the history of the Quinnipiac, 
explaining how the river remained 
central to the New Haven economy 
well into the 19th century. Its bottom 
was encrusted with jagged oyster beds 
so extensive that the area was known 
as “Clamtown.” The Quinnipiac port 
had a brisk traffic of merchants, 
fishermen and sailors, who called 
New Haven “Dragon” after the “sea 
dragons,” or harbor seals, that fed on 
the river’s fish and mollusks.

When his family first moved to 
New Haven, Christmann explained, 
“nobody was talking about the river. 
We felt there was a negative stigma 
about it.”  Part of that was due to the 
pollution that began with 19th century 
industrialization and continued into 
recent years. Christmann explained 
that people thought the river was 
unsalvageable because it repeatedly 
failed to meet state and national water 
quality standards. Over time, the 
generalized sense of apathy cleared 
the way for more dumping in the river. 
Safety 
was 
also 
an 
issue, 
Christmann said. “Crime levels were 
higher here than downtown.” With 
the river’s reputation tarnished, the 
neighborhood surrounding it became 
less desirable and more dangerous. 
People whose families might once 
have been closely involved with the 
river moved away, or retreated into 
their homes, disengaging from the 
community. So Christmann felt it was 
important that his project organize 
itself around locals reclaiming the 
river from different angles.  

“Our intent was that people 
upstream and downstream learn 
about the conditions, both good and 
bad,” Christmann said, explaining 
that the fund took the exhibit on tour 
along the riverbanks, from town hall 
to library to town hall, ending up in 
the Connecticut State Capitol building 
in Hartford. “It was great to have 
decision-makers see the exhibit,” he 
added. He seemed hopeful.

Although 
Alderman 
and 
Christmann 
both 
expressed 
worry for the health of the river, one 
activist in their community stands 
out for his extreme view on our 
relationship to nature, arguing that 
it may be too late to create a healthy 
environment.  Since 2000, physician 
Jerry Silbert has been the executive 
director of the Watershed Partnership, 
an environmental organization that 
has spearheaded multiple projects 
relating to the Quinnipiac River, some 
financed by the Q-River Fund.  Despite 
his success at getting several kinds of 
carcinogenic chemicals banned from 
being used on school lawns, he think 
it’s too late to undo the damage we’ve 
done to our environment.  He says 
we should be focusing on “how to 
maintain a semblance of civilization” 
in the face of the ever-worsening 
environmental crisis.  “Nature doesn’t 
negotiate, it just responds, and I think 
that response will be very harsh,” he 
told me over the phone, explaining that 
we now need to think about providing 
food through local infrastructure so 
that we are not relying on systems that 
require fossil fuels when those systems 
collapse. “I applaud the sentiment of 
sustainability, but I think one has to 
look critically at whether what one is 
doing is window-dressing or putting a 
band-aid on a hemorrhaging artery.”

He is particularly frustrated at 
how governments are doing next to 
nothing for the environment, and at 
how “the captains of industry don’t 
recognize what’s happening.”  That 
disconnect exists on a worldwide 
scale, not just in New Haven County. 
Even with increased interest in the 
Quinnipiac since the inception of 
the Fund, the river has still been 
making headlines for its precarious 
condition.  In January, local paper The 
Record-Journal reported that the Cytec 
chemical plant in Wallingford, just 
blocks from the river, had been listed 
as the second biggest releaser of toxic 
waste in the state of Connecticut.  
And on July 31, The Hartford Courant 
reported a fire in a forging plant in 
Southington.  Over 1000 gallons of 
oil are thought to have drained into 
the Quinnipiac. These events validate 
Silbert’s feeling that parties at all levels 
have to be engaged in protecting the 
environment.

That got me thinking about how 
interest in the Quinnipiac River is 
transferred from one person to the 
next. Educators and artists need to 
care to get residents thinking about 
the river; residents need to care to 
help make the lobbies successful at 
changing legislation; lawmakers need 
to care to listen to the lobbies; law-
enforcers have to care to uphold new 
legislation; heads of industry need 
to care to actually change practices 
instead of looking for loopholes. You 
can string all those players together 
in any number of different webs, 
but it will always end up an intricate 
codependency.

Wherever Alderman, Christmann, 
and Silbert fit into that chain, there is 
no question that they have all inserted 
themselves into the ecosystem of 
the river to try to generate more care 
and interest.  Yet I can imagine how 
associating yourself so closely with a 
river can make you as vulnerable to 
changes as the water and the bank. 
Over thirty years ago, Alderman was 
awakened by a bad smell; now she 
needs something to rouse others.
