EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Dear Readers,
This summer, one of The New Journal’s writers was accused of fabricating sources during 
her internship at a national newspaper. Our first reaction was surprise: why would an author fail to 
source? But the problem seems endemic to journalism, which raises questions about how publications 
should ensure readers trust what they print. Our experiences in the last few months made us realize 
the importance of fact checking in news and we decided to create a fact-checking process of our own 
at TNJ.

TNJ published the article in question, Liane Membis’ “Dreaming On,” in the February 2011 
issue, two editorial boards before our own. The piece’s veracity came into question in late June when 
Membis was fired from the Wall Street Journal. The Huffington Post had picked up “Dreaming On” 
soon after it was first published, and the news outlet removed the article from its site. 

Soon after we found out about the accusations against Membis, we began fact-checking 
her work for TNJ. The article included testimonies from two undocumented Yale students and had 
received significant attention and acclaim for its relevance and honest portrayal. Membis had granted 
the two sources anonymity, which understandably raised further suspicion of the article. But TNJ 
independently verified both the existence and testimonies of the sources. 

We contacted and received verifications from nearly all of the piece’s sources, with two 
notable exceptions. One source said she had never talked with the author. Membis told us this was 
a misattribution — an editing error — and we did independently verify that the quote belonged to 
another source. The second source has chosen not to speak with us, and there is little we can do about 
that. At the time of publication, we can neither confirm the accuracy of the piece nor refute it. The 
lesson seems clear: TNJ should have fact-checked before the piece went to publication.

So TNJ has decided to make a new commitment to its writers and readers. We are working to 
implement an effective but lightweight fact-checking system to cultivate a culture of accuracy among 
our writers. We have verified that none of the sources in the pieces published in this issue have been 
fabricated.

In handling allegations of inaccuracy, we are in good company. This summer, reporters Jonah 
Lehrer at The New Yorker, Fareed Zakaria at Time, and most recently Niall Ferguson at Newsweek came 
under suspicion for plagiarism or fabrication.

Why is this so ubiquitous? As Craig Silverman of The Poynter Institute reported, some of 
the most highly respected news outlets began to reduce or remove their fact-checking operations in 
the 1990s. Once a sign of a dedicated publication, a checking department is now a luxury.

Without a second line of factual defense, it is a writer’s integrity that compels him or her 
to report responsibly — integrity that editors at TNJ and at other publications have trusted almost 
absolutely. Indeed, we still have little reason to expect anything less than absolute honesty from our 
writers. We have no proof that our writers have falsified or plagiarized articles published in TNJ. But 
in light of this spate of accusations, we think it is important to have a support system to verify our 
writers’ work throughout the editing process.

Plagiarism and fabrication are often patterns. It is our responsibility to prevent them from 
our entering our pages. Every other month, we work with dedicated, intelligent writers whose articles 
highlight important issues for our readership. As people of the news, we are interested in truths.
Sincerely,
Juliana Hanle and Aliyya Swaby

“All voting is a sort of  gaming, like 
checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral 
tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong.”
-Henry David Thoreau

Uncertainty and chance are 
beginning to feel familiar to many 
Americans. The experiences of the 
last four years have left their mark on 
the American psyche and seem to be 
defining this fall’s coming election. 
These conditions can also be 
fournd in one New Haven resident’s 
new board game. In “Generations,” 
a single roll of the dice can undo 
anyone’s hard-won success. Through 
a mixture of prudence, cooperation, 
and good luck, players chart the 
lives of their avatars, negotiating the 
advantages or disadvantages that they  
arbitrarily received at birth. They have 
power over their fortunes only to the 
extent that they have the power to 
vote.

Over the last nine months, J.R. 
Logan, the director of new media 
at the United Way of Greater New 
Haven, has been developing this more 
sophisticated, 
high-stakes 
version 
of “Life.” The paper-and-die  game 
of life, death, or poverty offers far 
more futures for its players than the 
bourgeois options and risks that  its 
precursor permits. 

Logan’s game grew out of a 
tradition of pedagogical board games 
at United Way, where staffers often 
use simple games to explain the 
workings of charitable fundraising 
to prospective donors. “I’ve always 
believed in the power of games to 
educate,” Logan said. For its part, 
“Generations” teaches players about 
the tension between present and 
future generations, and between self-
interest and the good of society.

When I met him at his apartment, 
he showed me the game’s earliest 
renderings—a 
simple 
spreadsheet 
printout, 
full 
of 
handwritten 
annotations and rule changes. Even 
after designing a sturdier version 
through MakeHaven, New Haven’s 
collaborative workshop for tinkerers 
and inventors, Logan and his friends 
are still adding to the library of events 
that may befall characters in the board 
game. “You are hit by a bus,” reads 
one of the more tragic cards a player 
might draw. Players can also die by 
skydiving.  Players must choose among 
candidates with different rankings of 
priority on three major categories: 
education, health, and the economy. 
In an initial “primary round,” players 
with 
more 
money 
automatically 
have more political power. The top 
challenger gets to face the incumbent 
in a general election, and each player 
gets one vote. 

As with real elections, the game’s 
elections present both short-term 
and long-term choices for players. 
For example, a candidate could 
reduce health care in the short run, 
while ensuring permanent wealth for 
players with incomes above a certain 
threshold. All candidates’ platforms 
make immediate changes to the 
society, but also change a separate, 
“baseline” measure of the three 
categories. The next round inherits the 
baseline resulting from the previous 
game, altering their starting conditions 
for the next round of votes.

In 
one 
particular 
instance, 
Logan recalls, players in one round 
kept electing leaders committed to 
improving 
education 
and 
health 
who were also negligent toward the 
economy. In the following rounds, 



**Generations: A Board Game Reflecting Political Tradeoffs**

players 
found 
they 
had 
fewer 
economic opportunities. They were 
annoyed by their new limitations, and 
didn’t understand why they should 
bear the price of an earlier generation’s 
mistakes. But that’s precisely the 
point: “Generations” works so that 
players are chosen for, choosing for 
themselves, and choosing for others. 
The biggest difference between 
“Generations” and a real election is 
the absence of the party system in 
the game. “The candidates presented 
in the game are randomly chosen, so 
there’s more variation,” Logan notes. 
“But the game reflects our actual 
political tradeoffs between short-term 
and long-term interests.” 
Logan 
perceives 
two 
broad 
groups of players: “mechanical” and 
“principled.” 
Mechanical 
are determined to maximize their 
individual outcomes, while principled 
players advance a particular ideology 
even to their own detriment. This 
second 
group 
“becomes 
very 
emotionally attached to the outcome 
of the game,” while the first group 
seems to stay cooler and detached, 
Logan said. Politically opinionated or 
partisan players do not necessarily fall 
into the second group. 
Logan is Canadian by birth and 
retains only a hint of an accent in the 
way he says “about.” His enthusiasm 
for his native country’s politics shows 
in the game, for example, in the 
cards that offer a player the chance 
to purchase plush health insurance. 
Logan freely admits the game reflects 
his political inclinations—if voters 
followed principle rather than self-
interest, they’d come to support the 
social democratic policies that he 
favors and believes realize everyone’s 
long-term interests. The principled 
player will eventually make the best 
choice, which, for Logan, means a 
social democratic agenda.
For 
this 
fall’s 
Republican 
candidate Mitt Romney, the “best 
choice” relies on entirely different 
assumptions, but his campaign now 
seems to share Logan’s logic. He has 
specifically addressed the mechanical 
voter, asking individuals whether they 
are better off than they were four years 
ago. His campaign has hammered 
away at the public perception of the 
state of the economy in the hope of 
implicating President Barack Obama 
by association. This approach reflects 
a dominant view in social science that 
economic performance predicts the 
outcome of presidential elections.
Forecasting 
models 
largely 
Journal. Will this new, ideological 
rhetoric appeal beyond his party’s own 
base?
It’s difficult to predict how 
appealing to voters’ ideologies will 
work out in the real elections, but the 
board game suggests Romney’s tactic 
may be a smart one. One of Logan’s 
most interesting observations suggests 
that even without parties, voters will 
still behave ideologically rather than 
self-interestedly. The question is, do 
this election’s undecided voters—the 
mystical 6 to 8 percent, according 
to Gallup’s daily tracking poll—
vote like the non-partisan players of 
“Generations”? Are undecided voters 
simply principled non-partisans, or, 
are they lost souls, unsure of what is 
mechanically best for them?
Polls consistently show that a 
large majority of Americans feel the 
country is on the “wrong track” and 
worry that their children’s generation 
will be worse off than they are. Uneasy 
feelings, of course, don’t coalesce into 
votes on their own. It takes a narrative 
to interpret and give coherence to 
voters’ confusion. In elections like 
the upcoming November’s, there 
is opportunity for that narrative to 
recreate itself every few months. In 
the elections of “Generations,” voters’ 
decisions are made only minutes apart.

For ritual’s sake, it took about a 
dozen pairs of scissors to cut the blue 
ribbon and open New Haven’s newest 
institution of learning, located four 
blocks away from Yale’s Old Campus. 
When the ribbon fell, the couple 
hundred attendees cheered. The 
celebrations, attended by an estimated 
total of eight hundred people, would 
assume that the economic man, homo 
economicus, will be voting on November 
6. 
But in picking Rep. Paul Ryan 
as his running mate, Romney has 
shifted from his earlier reliance on 
pocketbook issues. His recent focus 
on welfare, entitlements, and deficits 
reflects 
the 
Romney 
campaign’s 
realignment with the principles of 
small-government 
conservatism. 
Traditionally, candidates pivot toward 
the center in the general election to 
appeal to the median voter. But now 
the Romney campaign, wants to frame 
this election as a battle for the soul of 
the country, not just a referendum on 
four years of economic news, as noted 
in an August 28 article in the National 


continue for at least seven hours. 
The public ceremonies August 
29 marked the opening of Gateway 
Community College, whose student 
population is currently comparable to 
Yale’s in number. The main campus’s 
move downtown, to a building just 
four blocks from Old Campus, 
is expected to increase Gateway’s 
enrollment capacity to roughly fifteen 
thousand. It took nine years to plan 
and construct the 360,000 square 
foot space and the building is LEED-
certified, meeting US Green Building 
Council standards for sustainability.
At the ceremony, Gary Cole, a 
1976 Gateway graduate, ate at a table 
outside where he could follow the 
festivities and compare the smaller 
Long Wharf campus to the new 
building. A disabled veteran in his late 
60s, he said he attended school with 
fellow veterans who were all taking 
advantage of their benefits. Cole, 
who pays the Gateway tuition for 
his granddaughter, spent the grand 
opening talking to other Gateway 
alumni, 
appreciating 
those 
who 
remembered him and remembered 
their former professors. 
“I hope they get involved with 
Yale,” he said of the school’s new 
campus. “Because it’s downtown, they 
can get affiliated.”
The question remains: how will 
Yale interact with the community 
college’s main campus move to the 
corner of Church and George? 
One Gateway alumnus is sure 
that these new faces, while bringing 
business to downtown New Haven, 
won’t be wildly welcome to mingle 
with the Yalies. 
“They always looked down on 
us,” said Sasha Lay, who graduated 
from Gateway’s North Haven campus 
in May and has started at Southern 
Connecticut State University. “Yale 
students really like to keep to 
themselves.” 
The former Director of Career 
Services at Gateway, Robert A. Miles, 
called Yale and Gateway “different 
universes.” The average age of a 
Gateway student is 29, he said, and the 
majority of students attend part-time 
to get their Associate degrees. Still, 
Miles, who retired in 2009, is hopeful 
that the two schools will partner—
socially, philosophically, academically, 
economically—and that Yale will 
mindfully create space for Gateway in 
New Haven. 
When 
asked 
whether 
Yale 
supports Gateway financially, Lauren 
Zucker, a representative of Yale’s 
Office of New Haven and State 
Affairs, responded, “Yes, we are 
supportive of Gateway and continue 
to work closely with them.”
Hundreds 
gathered 
to 
hear 
speeches by many involved in the 
school, including executives involved 
in the construction, the President of 
the school, and politicians Mayor John 
DeStefano, Congresswoman Rosa 
L. DeLauro, U.S. Senator Richard 
Blumenthal, State Senator Martin 
Looney, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. 
Malloy 
stressed 
that 
celebration was in honor of “not 
bricks and mortar, but our future” 
and that the opening of the Church 
Street location was a step, not an end. 
He spoke for Connecticut when he 
said, “we will have no progress in this 
state unless we throw our shoulder 
to the wheel, unless we produce the 
kind of product in this state that will 
allow us to compete with the rest of 
the world.” 
While most listened to the 
series of speeches, many, like Cole, 
wandered the school’s halls, filled for 
the occasion with booths for various 
New Haven staples. 
At one booth sat Peter Johnson 
DIV ‘02, who wore a bowtie, and 
said that he hoped to start Christian 
programming at the college.
Some smaller booths ran out of 
food, and free samples abounded. The 
cafeteria was also up and running. An 
older woman, wearing a cap, asked for 
the price of a sandwich. It was free, 
and, pleased, she ate her sandwich at 
an available table. For those who grew 
hungry, the Boar’s Head booth served 
a selection of packed sandwiches while 
Temple Grille took orders for custom-
made salads. One mother sat by the 
kiosks with her two children outside 
the auditorium, where only standing 
space was left. Inside, the Elm City 
Co-op Market laid out fresh apples 
across from a salon’s hair braiding 
station, and hushed chatter came from 
the new, high-ceilinged cafeteria. 
The afternoon brought a series 
of group tours through the ninety 
classrooms, library, culinary center, 
and various other facilities. It looked 
different 
from 
Gateway’s 
previous main campus—the tour 
attendees 
enjoyed 
pointing 
out 
different academic spaces. 
Like Yale’s campus, the building 
creates its own unique space in 
downtown 
New 
Haven. 
The 
standardization of form and style that 
dominates its two blocks sets it apart 
from the rest of the neighborhood. 
However, its spaces, unlike Yale’s, are 
centered around the indoors. 
The city’s leaders hope the new 
addition to the skyline will become 
a symbol of community and hope 
for New Haven. “While there is 
another college downtown, Gateway 
Community College will be the first 
college they will see and it will be the 
college that will serve our families, our 
businesses and deliver our possibilities 
and opportunities,” DeStefano said at 
the event.

I
n 1989, a Palestinian extremist 
walked into an office in the 
West Bank and kidnapped Chris 
George. George had been working 
for Save the Children, an international 
humanitarian 
organization 
that 
provides food, medical care, and 
education for children in need. 
“He liked me,” George said of his 
kidnapper. “He was just using me 
for political ends.” George was a 
prominent American, and the extremist 
had been to the organization’s office 
to discuss the construction of a 
kindergarten in the man’s refugee 
camp. After thirty-five hours, George 
was released and given a thirteen-page 
letter for then President George H. W. 
Bush criticizing US support of Israel. 
The Israeli secret service killed the 
extremist a week later. 


After his release, George said in 
an interview, “They were nice to me. 
I practiced my Arabic during this 
period, I ate my food – fish.” George 
handles things stoically, which has also 
helped him navigate the uncertain 
terrain of refugee resettlement in 
New Haven.
“Again? 3-2-1?”
“3-2-1.”
The documentary crew, three 
students from Southern Connecticut 
University, started filming outside the 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant 
Services building, or IRIS. George, 
now IRIS’s executive director for the 
last seven years, was wearing white 
khaki pants, a gray shirt, black shoes, 
and a brown belt. He has gray hair, 
wears glasses, and has a mustache. 
The pin on his shirt said “support 
refugees,” in bright pink letters. He 
wore a black digital watch and used 
the earbuds on his iPhone to make 
phone calls. 
“Welcome to IRIS,” he said, 
“and we are your refugee integration 
service.” The crew stopped filming 
and they walked inside the building. 
George started to clean up the mess 
in the front room, which was filled 
with plastic bags full of clothes and 
scattered papers and magazines. 
“We get a lot of donations,” he said 
with a laugh. IRIS has served almost 
four thousand refugees from Iraq, 
Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia over the 
past twenty-five years, and each year 
they work with about two hundred 
new clients, about a third of all the 
refugees who enter Connecticut, 
George told the filmmakers. Since 
1980, 
Connecticut 
has 
resettled  
twenty-eight 
thousand 
refugees. 
According to the US Department 
of State, three million refugees have 
come to the US since 1975, more than 
twice the combined total number of 
refugees accepted by the nine other 
countries with resettlement programs. 
But the US still only resettles less than 
one percent of the 16 million refugees 
worldwide. 
Reading those numbers, I was 
struck by the enormity of the task 
of resettlement. I couldn’t help but 
think of the old tale about an old man 
who walked down the beach and saw 
a child returning washed-up starfish 
to the ocean. When the old man told 
the child his actions wouldn’t make a 
difference, the boy picked up another 
starfish and threw it back in saying, “I 
made a difference for that one.” I have 
trouble understanding how anyone 
can have that child’s attitude toward 
such astounding numbers. Where 
does that sense of duty and obligation 
come from? But George seems less 
interested in speaking to me about the 
source of his relentless commitment 
than about the necessity of this work 
for the refugees he assists. His steady 
approach helps his clients find routine 
in a process loaded with insecurity. 
Inside the IRIS building, there 
were two Iraqi refugees sitting in 
the main reception office and four 
African refugees in a large room to the 
side, working with a volunteer to fill 
out applications. The Iraqis appeared 
to be husband and wife, middle aged. 
George asked for their permission 
to be filmed, but they shook their 
heads. The camera crew moved into 
the office, and they started filming 
with the refugees behind them. “Our 
job is to help them be self-sufficient,” 
George said. “We are so fortunate 
to get incredible volunteers: high 
schools, synagogues, even our clients 
are volunteers.” In the food pantry 
down the hall, families can come in 
to get two bags of groceries every 
Wednesday. Since it was Thursday, the 
room was empty. 
A woman walked up to George 
and said, “So far so good?” 
“So far so great.” 
The crew asked him to stand 
by a wall near the reception area and 
give them an introduction to the work 
IRIS does. George smiled and began 
to deliver a speech on what they do 
at IRIS. A large part of George’s job 
is public speaking and outreach. He’s 
a comfortable and relaxed public 
speaker, but he stumbled at the end 
and the crew stopped filming. They 
asked him to try again, and George 
gave the same speech, word for word, 
the words seeming to come naturally: 
“A refugee is someone who has 
a well founded fear of persecution. 
Hopefully, some go back to the country 
they fled from if the persecution ends. 
Some integrate in the country they 
fled to. And some come here and work 
with us. We meet them at the airport, 
send them to a furnished apartment. 
We help these new Americans get 
off to a good start. That’s our job, to 
make them self-sufficient. This is a 
lifesaving program.” 
George let the film crew take 
some footage around the office and 
then sat down on a couch in the 
reception area next to me. 
“Sometimes,” he said, “I wish we 
were back to the no-press policy, but 
I just got off the phone with a major 
apartment complex. They’d never 
heard of refugee integration. They’re 
giving us a great price for a three- to 
four-bedroom apartment, and they 
want to do more business with us.” 
George said this isn’t a typical day at 
the IRIS office, and I asked what a 
typical day would be like. He smiled 
and said that there is nothing routine 
about refugee resettlement.
met George weeks earlier at a local 
café. His shirt-sleeves were rolled 
to his elbow and he was carrying a 
worn-out planner. He apologized for 
being late; one of IRIS’ clients had 
called because the client’s roommate, 
an elderly refugee from Iraq, had 
left without telling anyone where 
he’d gone. George went over to the 
apartment, but there was nothing he 
could do. All business, George opened 
his planner on the table: he would be 
at a refugee resettlement conference

with three hundred other non-
profits all of next week, a meeting 
at Quinnipiac on April 10, a meeting 
in new London at 7 p.m. three days 
later, and on Monday, he would be 
welcoming a family of seven from 
Darfur. 
“You could come to that,” he 
said. George gave me a list of his 
colleagues to talk to while he was 
away, and after second thought added 
Ron Berger to the list, his best 
friend since third grade. Berger 
knows him well, and was the 
only person on the list George 
didn’t know from work. 

I 
called Berger on a Thursday 
morning. “Can you hear me 
okay? I’m in my truck,” he said. 
Berger teaches a course at the 
Harvard Graduate School of 
Education, and he drives there 
every week from his home 
in 
Amherst, 
Massachusetts. 
He worked as a public school 
teacher for ten years, and works 
as the Chief Program Officer 
of Expeditionary Learning, an 
organization that opens schools 
and partners with existing ones 
in urban and rural schools to 
improve the quality of struggling 
school districts.
Berger said that even as a boy 
growing up, George was magnetic. 
“Chris has a mythic and heroic 
quality,” he said. George was an 
all-American athlete and ran cross-
country before being recruited for 
the lacrosse team, where he was co-
captain and an all-star player, a state 
champ in high school and the first 
string all American midfield. “Every 
year,” Berger said, “Chris goes back 
to Montclair for the alumni lacrosse 
game. They play a game against guys 
who are twenty-eight or twenty-one. 
He’s fifty-eight and plays against them. 
He has this great 1970’s lacrosse shirt, 
the same shirt he wore when he was in 
high school. He’s playing this alumni 
game in this old antique shirt.” His 
long-term loyalty to the team shows a 
doggedness of character, a man who 
never gives up.
Berger recalled getting into his 
truck in 1989, turning on his radio 
and hearing the first story on NPR. 
It was about George’s kidnapping. He 
had been the first foreigner kidnapped 
in Israel for political reasons, making 
it national news. Berger had been 
shocked, and now so was I. In the few 
weeks I had spent talking to George 
about the significant details of his 
life, he had never mentioned being 
kidnapped. 

stopped by George’s office a few 
days later. The walls were covered 
with newspaper clippings: a headline 
from the New Haven Register 
reads “Iraqi refugees find America 
challenging,” another, “Wars toll 
heavy for many Iraqi children,” and 
finally, “Afghan refugees now happily 
resettled.” An Indiana Jones hat sits 
on a basketball on top of a bookshelf 
in the corner. I asked why he had 
never told me he was kidnapped by 
terrorists. 
“I don’t like the word terrorist.” 
In the few weeks I 
had spent talking to 
George about the 
significant details 
of his life, he had 
never mentioned 
being kidnapped. 

George sighed. “I was abducted, I 
guess it was a kidnapping. It was only 
thirty-five hours. I don’t know if I’d 
call them terrorists. It was very short. 
I would never ever put myself in the 
very unlucky number of people who 
were held for a long time. I was never 
tortured, they treated me very well.” It 
was an uncomfortable subject and he 
was visibly upset when he told me the 
extremist was killed a week later. 

K
elly 
Hebrank 
started 
working at IRIS eight 
months before George took 
over 
as 
executive 
director, 
and has known him since he 
interviewed for the job. “From 
the beginning,” Hebrank said, 
“he made the impression of 
having energy.” She explained 
to me that the general attitude 
at IRIS had been that because 
immigration 
was 
highly 
controversial, they would work 
diligently, but quietly. George 
changed that. Though George 
had complained to me earlier 
about the elimination of a no-
press policy, he was the one who 
had gotten rid of it. “Before 
Chris,” Hebrank said, “If I said 
I worked at IRIS, nobody knew what I 
was talking about.” 

I asked Hebrank if she knew him 
outside of the office. She laughed and 
said, “We work a lot.”

L
ater that day, George met with 
me in a small side room down 
the hall because two of his colleagues 
were having a phone conference in 
his office. George told me he wished 
IRIS had money for a larger building 
because they don’t have enough office 
space. Their last building, he said, was 
about a quarter this size. There was 
only enough room for their desks and 
virtually no room for meeting spaces 
for the refugees. We were in one of 
the meeting rooms for refugees, which 
has cinderblock walls, and George was

sitting at a white plastic table with 
folding chairs. He told me that he 
always makes a point of mentioning 
Montclair, New Jersey. “It really did 
have a formative impact on my life,” 
George said. “It’s why I’m doing what 
I’m doing now.”  

George’s mother, a former nurse, 
and his father, a former broadcast 
journalist at ABC, moved to Montclair 
when George was in the third grade. 
His classmates called the their home 
the “mad scientist house,” because it 
was giant and broken-down, believed 
to be haunted. Since George was 
eight, he would come home from 
school and work for hours, fixing it up 
with his father.
In 1972, during the town’s racial 
desegregation of high schools, George 
was bussed from the white to the black 
part of town for school. Navigating 
racial tension was an early practice for 
cross-cultural understanding, and it 
made him develop an appreciation for 
diversity and tolerance.
George studied history and 
anthropology at the University of 
Pennsylvania , where he met his wife, 
Elizabeth, during the first week of 
school. After graduation, he joined 
the Peace Corps in 1997, assigned 
to volunteer in Oman. Elizabeth 
initially planned on staying in the 
US to pursue a career in art. “After a 
few months of desert in the Arabian 
Peninsula, we decided we did not like 
being apart.” George said. “Oman 
is a very conservative country. The 
only way she could come was if we 
got married.” They both traveled 
to Cyprus, where they married in 
1978. Elizabeth went back to Oman 
with him and worked as a darkroom 
technician in George’s office. 
“Montclair was my formative 
experience. For my children, it was 
growing up in the West Bank,” George 
said, referring to his stint there for 
Save the Children Foundation. The 
oldest is an associate producer for 
NPR. She has produced stories in 
Iraq, Egypt, and in Libya during the 
fall of Gadhafi. George’s second child 
is twenty-four and works in Sierra 
Leon as a Peace Corps volunteer. His 
youngest studied drama at the Tisch 
School of the Arts at New York 
University, from which he recently 
graduated. 

After two years in the Peace Corps, 
George returned to Philadelphia, 
working as a plumber, bartender, and 
substitute teacher. In 1982, George left 
for Lebanon, working with Quakers in 
housing reconstruction in Lebanese 
villages and refugee camps until 1984. 
In 1985, George began working as 
a director of the Save the Children 
Foundation, and in 1986 became 
Director of the Left Bank in Gaza. He 
worked with Save the Children for nine 
years. He spent the first half of that 
time in the West Bank in Gaza, and 
the second half at the organization’s 
headquarters in Westport, Conn. After 
the kidnapping in 1989, Chris stayed 
for another year before moving back 
to work as the Acting Director for the 
Middle East Region.  After leaving 
the organization in 1994, he became 
director of the Middle East division of 
Human Rights Watch until 1996. For 
the next four years after that, he was a 
director of the United States Agency 
for 
International 
Development’s 
legislative strengthening project with 
the Palestinian Parliament. Then, for 
three years on a USAID contract, 
George ran an organization that gave 
grants to Palestinian non-profits. 
From 2003 to 2004, he did volunteer 
work, consulting, and writing in 
Connecticut on legislative issues. 
George has been at IRIS since 2005.
George has gone back and forth 
from the US to the Middle East for 
the last twenty-five years. “You get 
stuck,” he told me, “Whether you like 
it or not, the jobs you’re qualified for 
are in the Middle East.” But George 
didn’t just get stuck. He has chosen 
to work in one of the most politically, 
religiously, and economically sensitive 
areas in the world.

T
he family of seven from Darfur 
had arrived at an apartment a 
few blocks away from a synagogue 
the night before we met them. Several 
women from the synagogue had 
volunteered to help them, and had 
spent the last week gathering dishware 
and utensils, arranging the furniture, 
and gathering clothes. The women 
had arrived earlier, and George was 
coming to welcome the family and 
bring donations. George meets with 
every refugee IRIS works with.
The apartment was the left half 
of a white two-story house in the 
Westville neighborhood of New 
Haven. A woman from the synagogue 
stood on the porch as the others 
grabbed the dinner from their car. 
George knocked on the door, and a 
tall, dark, thin man with a moustache 
stepped out. He was excited to see 
George, and they began to speak in 
Arabic. They smiled, and the man 
welcomed us inside.  

The family fled from Darfur 
to Egypt in 2006. The two youngest 
daughters, five-year-old Mariam and 
two-year-old Aya, had never seen 
Darfur. That’s how long it can take for 
a family of refugees to resettle in the 
United States. 

The living room had hardwood 
floors and was nearly empty except 
for a sofa and a small bookshelf. 
A tall woman wearing a long dress 
stood by the kitchen door, and a small 
child poked his head from behind 
her. George spoke with the woman, 
and then leaned into the next room, 
speaking English. The thirteen-year-
old son, Badreldin, also spoke English, 
and George encouraged him to come 
out and say hello. Small and skinny, 
he slowly walked to the women. One 
of the women from the synagogue 
pulled a picture dictionary from a bag. 
He showed it to his mother, and she 
smiled. 

George spoke with the man in

Arabic, pointing at the floor then at a 
table. Finally, the man pointed to the 
floor. George motioned to me and I 
followed him outside to the back of 
his Jeep 4x4. “We’re going to bring 
the TV inside.” We lifted it together 
and brought it to where the man had 
pointed. One of the volunteers was 
giving the wife a bag of food they 
had prepared for them. On each of 
the plastic containers, there was the 
name of the dish in English and then 
Arabic; one of the women from the 
synagogue had used Google Translate 
to make labels. After everything was 
brought into the home, the couple 
walked us to the door and thanked us 
again. The husband shook hands with 
George. 

A
s George drove me back home, 
I asked him what he had been 
saying to the family in Arabic. He said, 
little things, like where to put the TV, 
introducing the women, telling them 
they brought food. We were silent 
for a moment, and George said that 
they use the immigrant integration 
experience as a blueprint for refugee 
resettlement. It’s a difficult process, 
but it’s always that way. His job was just 
to make them self-sufficient, because 
IRIS doesn’t have enough resources 
to take care of them indefinitely. IRIS 
resettles them, and the refugees take 
care of themselves. It is the American 
Dream: self-reliance, hard work, 
pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. 
“My 
grandfather 
an 
immigrant,” 
George 
said. 
His 
grandfather’s last name was originally 
Georgacopoulis. “It makes us proud 
and strong. That’s how it is in America. 
It’s very rare to say ‘He didn’t make 
it.’” 

I asked about the missing Iraqi 
roommate. George explained that the 
man, who has since moved back to the 
US, had flown to the Middle East to 
try to meet with his family in Jordan. 
But George wasn’t sure what he would 
be going back to. I asked if the man’s 
leaving like that was discouraging, 
but George responded stoically that 
it rarely happens. For a second, I 
thought I saw a look of defeat as 
George sighed and watched his 
boulder roll back down the mountain. 
But it was only a second. I knew that 
whether it was at IRIS or anywhere 
else, George will always roll it back 
up again. George was expecting six 
refugees from Eritrea that needed 
an apartment, food, clothes, and 
tutors to teach them English. His 
refugees needed health insurance, 
George returns a phone call in his office. 
food stamps, social security numbers, 
and help filling out job applications. 
They needed to learn where to buy 
groceries, that squirrels are not rats, 
that dogs are not wild animals, and 
that joggers aren’t running away from 
anything. There is nothing routine 
about refugee resettlement.

here 
is 
an 
unspoken 
understanding that students 
leaving 
Yale 
will 
find 
employment that requires them to 
work with their minds. We didn’t come 
to this university to train for manual 
labor. But all my experiences—in the 
field, in the construction site, and 
even in the classroom—suggest that 
physical work can teach a depth of 
mental strength that we do not acquire 
in our academic studies.

I’ve spent my summers at farms 
and summer camps; I’ve cleaned 
toilets, washed dishes, herded goats, 
stayed up all night with vomiting 
eleven-year-olds, picked green beans, 
braided garlic, and unloaded milk 
trucks. I’ve never held an unpaid 
internship or spent a summer at a 
desk.  A month after graduation, I 
boarded a plane to Sitka, Alaska, to 
join a group of Yale students doing 
construction work at Sheldon Jackson 
Campus, the new home of Alaska 
Arts Southeast.

The Sheldon Jackson College 
on Baranof Island, in the Alaska 
panhandle, first experienced financial 
setbacks in the 1980s. In 2007 it closed 
its doors, leaving the town of Sitka 
with a beautiful, empty, and quickly 
deteriorating college campus. In 
2011, the campus’s twenty buildings 
and more than twenty of its acres 
were given to Alaska Arts Southeast, 
with the hope that the shuttered 
classrooms and dormitories would 
grow into a thriving center for arts and 
humanities. Hundreds of volunteers 
donated thousands of work hours 
and half a million dollars to restore

the school, which is now a National 
Historic Landmark. Jonathan Kreiss-
Tomkins ’12, who grew up in Sitka, 
invited Yalies to join in the effort for 
the summer through a program called 
Bulldogs on Baranof Island.

This summer, as I watched many 
of my friends begin their working 
lives—as teachers, analysts, activists, 
journalists, law students—I couldn’t 
help but compare my own form of 
work to theirs. What was manual 
labor teaching me? What was 
I accomplishing? And what 
did it mean for an Ivy League 
graduate to choose to install 
insulation all day? 

Two years ago, after a 
series of jobs on farms, I was 
certain that I wanted to be a 
farmer. I loved the work and 
thought it held important 
value for society. I knew that 
I preferred working actively 
with my body, hands, and 
mind (even as a summer 
camp dishwasher) to writing 
emails, making spreadsheets, 
and spending the entire day 
behind a computer screen. 

But as I begin the process of 
building a career and working 
life, I’ve begun to worry that 
to choose to farm would be to 
shirk the responsibilities of my degree 
in some crucial way. 
Though 
I 
have 
long 
held 
physical work to be an important 
part of education, I have come to 
distrust the rhetoric of “fulfillment,” 
“satisfaction,” and “good work” that 
dominates many conversations about 
the value of elite students engaging 
in manual labor. In an attempt to 
clarify my own thoughts, I decided 
to ask these questions to other Yalies 
who had chosen to join the Sheldon 
Jackson work crew or had spent 
time doing manual work elsewhere. 
Their 
answers 
were 
thoughtful, 
varied, surprising, and illuminating, 
and resonated deeply with my own 
attempts to define education and 
ethical work over the past four years.

A
laska is a place that people run 
away to. In Into the Wild, John 
Krakauer writes, “Alaska has long 
been a magnet for dreamers and 
misfits, people who think the unsullied 
enormity of the Last Frontier will patch 
all the holes in their lives.” Though 
my six-week sojourn to the city of 
Sitka in the mild, misty southeast isn’t 
comparable to Chris McCandless’s 
fatal journey into the Alaska bush, 
I share some of the idealism and 
escapism that made McCandless such 
a controversial figure. I like doing 
manual work because I lose myself in 
it. These humble tasks have their own 
unsullied enormity. Call it therapeutic, 
call it lazy, but I enjoy pulling up 
weeds for hours or sanding beams all 
day. There is an element of escapism 
in conducting hard physical labor—
but it also cultivates its own life of the 
mind. We discovered that the mind 
and body aren’t so separate after all.

n May 2009 when I read Michael B. 
Crawford’s New York Times Magazine 
article “The Case for Working 
With Your Hands,” it electrified 
me. Crawford traces his journey 
from political philosophy Ph.D. to 
motorcycle repairman and, along 
the way, makes the argument that 
concrete work has an intellectual and 
ethical dimension sorely lacking in our 
information-age economy. Concrete 
work, he writes, “answers to a basic 
human need of the one who does it.” 
Meanwhile, the country’s relentless 
focus on “mind work” and 
higher 
education 
(at 
an 
increasingly 
astronomical 
cost to students, I might add) 
is not serving its citizens’ 
minds or morals. Working 
with one’s hands cultivates 
“individual 
responsibility” 
in a way that abstract work 
never can. He wrote of “an 
ethic of paying attention that 
develops in the trades through 
hard experience.” According 
to Crawford, not only was my 
individual integrity at stake, 
but the fate of my community 
as well: “Work forms us, and 
deforms us,” he warned, “with 
broad public consequences.”

After a freshman year 
spent shuttling between the 
library, where I scrambled 
to keep up with my Directed Studies 
workload, and dorm rooms on Old 
Campus, where I scrambled to keep 
up with my classmates’ drinking 
habits, Crawford’s essay articulated 
much of the dissatisfaction I felt 
with my education and my lifestyle. 
I’d always been most comfortable 
when making things, whether it was a 
knit hat, a clean room, or a wooden 
box. Yet I struggled to find a way to 
connect that tactile form of thinking 
and production to the work that Yale 
assigned and valued. That summer 
I interned at the Yale Sustainable 
Food Project, and spent seven hours 
a day seeding, weeding, planting and 
harvesting. I had never been happier.

Many students’ reflections on the 
work crew echo Crawford’s reasoning. 
Again and again they returned to 
words like “concrete,” “tangible,” and 
“satisfying.” Manual work like painting, 
sanding or taking off a roof felt real 
in a way that schoolwork often didn’t. 
Omar Dairanieh ’13 spent two months 
in SJC’s central auditorium, Richard 
H. Allen Memorial Hall, before 
the rest of the work crew arrived, 
leveling floors for dance studios and 
painting brackets. The work, he said, 
“was exhausting and backbreaking, 
but it was extremely rewarding. I 
actually got to see a huge differences 
in the building; there was noticeable, 
concrete proof of the work I was 
doing.” This stood in stark contrast to 
his experience as a history major. “I 
spent the last three years at Yale taking 
theory-heavy courses that all came to 
similar conclusions: nothing is real or 
stable or relevant,” Dairanieh said. “As 
challenging and as interesting as that 
critical approach may be, it was also 
really disenchanting.” His experience 
in Alaska was therapeutic, he said, 
and allowed him to re-engage in the 
material world. Manual labor reminded 
him that “things exist. It seems simple, 
but it was extremely reassuring.”

The reality of repetitive manual 
work forced me to slow down, to be 
patient in a way I rarely had to be 
at Yale. Roger Schmidt, director of 
Alaska Arts Southeast and organizer 
of this summer’s volunteer work, 
said that one of the main differences 
between concrete and abstract work is 
the amount of time it takes, with the 
former more time-consuming than 
the latter. Some students had a hard 
time getting used to the difference.  Ira 
Slomski-Pritz ’14 found the repetitive 
motions of painting and sanding 
unenjoyable. “I felt useful because I 
knew these things had to be done and 
this was helpful to the campus, but I 
don’t think that given a choice and if 
I had more skills I would see much 
value in going back and doing those 
jobs.”

I was the kind of child who, 
when asked to name her favorite 
activity, answered, “unloading the 
dishwasher.” I have always found 
focus and enjoyment in repetitive 
work. One of the projects I worked 
on in Allen was sanding tall, laminated 
cedar beams that stretched from the 
floor to the rafters. When I flipped 
the sander switch, I felt vibrations 
quiver up my arm, from fingertips 
to shoulder. I pressed it to the wood 
and swept the machine in circles. 
Slowly, the blackened surface of the 
beam wore away to reveal an amber 
cedar grain. I worked across the 
beam horizontally, then up vertically, 
circling and circling, making my way 
up the ladder rung by rung. Little piles 
of sawdust gathered on the floor and 
stacks of worn sandpaper grew on the 
worktable. After about half an hour 
my arm was sore, but as I worked

,either the muscles adapted themselves 
to the motion, or I got used to the 
slight ache. The satisfaction came 
from the repetition, from the mere 
fact of continuing, from the action of 
going over every piece of the beam 
with equal attention. A cut corner 
would manifest itself as a visible 
blot. To do a good job, I just needed 
to be patient, to stick with it. Part of 
me feels proud of that patience and 
stamina. That part agrees 
with Schmidt when he said of 
repetition, “To me that’s kind 
of the essence of hard work. 
If you want to do something 
well, you have to do it for a 
long time, and repetitively.” 
But an equally strong part 
argues back that just because 
something is satisfying doesn’t 
make it worthwhile. Abstract 
work is often unsatisfying 
because it’s harder to reach 
a definite conclusion in a 
specific time frame.


Members of the crew 
were quick to point out that 
manual work often required 
sophisticated, 
abstract 
problem solving. We spent 
two days in mid-July clearing 
a roof of stones, moss 
and gravel, then removing 
waterlogged foam insulation 
so that the roof could be re-
waterproofed and insulated in 
the coming weeks. A group of 
volunteers including Slomski-
Pritz devised a system for 
safely removing gravel from the 
roof. It took them three separate 
arrangements of tarp and cement 
blocks to create a functional system. 
As I listened to Slomski-Pritz 
describe the process of building the 
ramp, two things became clear. The 
first is that it is ridiculous to describe 
manual work as mindless. The kind 
of problem solving he talked through 
is essentially the same as the kind 
I use when developing an idea for a 
paper or solving a problem set. Try 
one thing. See if it works. When it 
doesn’t, figure out why not. Try again 
until you get it right. In the process, 
you discover something about how 
a text or a concept or a ramp works. 
The second thing I observed is that, 
as totally unskilled amateurs, the crew 
had a lot to learn.


For some, construction work 
meant a chance to explore academic 
interests in a new setting. Anne 
Lovelace, a psychology major who 
plans to attend medical school, at first 
found her choice to join the work 
crew difficult to explain to others. 
“Construction in and of itself,” 
she said, “doesn’t really match with 
my academic interest or my career 
interest.” But to her surprise, the work 
crew offered a laboratory unlike any 
she had encountered at Yale. “A lot of 
my academic background comes from 
thinking about how people work and 
the way groups interact,” Lovelace 
said. “Working on the construction 
crew, I brought my psych perspective 
and was paying attention to how the 
group worked, what people needed, 
and how people played off each 
other.” The work crew provided 
Lovelace with a group dynamic to 
explore that was different from the 
seminar groups and athletic teams she 
was used to observing at Yale. 
She had the chance to observe 
a group figuring out how to 
use tools and resources to 
complete a concrete task.


Dairanieh 
specifically 
came to Sitka in large part 
to complement his work 
in 
the 
classroom, 
where 
he has been working with 
wood as a sculptor and artist 
for the past year. He was 
drawn to the renovations 
because he wanted to learn 
formal carpentry technique. 
Dairanieh said he gained not 
just woodworking skills, but 
a sense of responsibility and 
belonging to the community as 
well: “I was given a to-do list, a 
deadline and basic instructions 
and I, an untrained outsider, 
was trusted—by the foreman, 
by SFAC administration, by 
Sitka residents—to carry it 
out, to work on a project 
the entire community cared 
deeply about. It was beautiful 
and humbling.”


Indeed, proponents of manual 
work assert that one of its major 
benefits is that it teaches responsibility 
in an immediate way that abstract 
tasks cannot. When the product 
of your work is visible, and you 
are held directly accountable for it 
by people you know, you are more 
inclined—forced, even—to put in 
your best effort. The thought of 
embarrassment is powerful. It’s easier 
to dismiss a paper that you bullshitted 
It is ridiculous to 
describe manual 
work as mindless. The 
kind of problem-solving 
he talked through is 
essentially the same 
as the kind I use when 
developing an idea for 
a paper or solving a 
problem set.

and never have to read again than to 
ignore a sloppy painting job that you 
see every day. Manual work forces you 
to exercise integrity and care. 
And these are qualities that we 
would hope for in our leaders, people 
in the positions that some Yalies, and 
other similarly-trained students, may 
hold one day. Crawford writes, “Why 
not encourage gifted students to learn 
a trade, if only in the summers, so that 
their fingers will be crushed once or 
twice before they go on to run the 
country?” Schmidt put the point more 
mildly, but the sentiment was the same: 
“People who are positioned to make 
large decisions about other people, 
who aren’t grounded in the tangible 
activity of other humans, often make 
really big mistakes.” Powerful people, 
he argues, need to be anchored in the 
material world. 


T
he inherent value of working 
with one’s hands is complicated 
by the various situations in which 
people can execute that labor. I worry 
that writers like Crawford give too 
easy an answer to a complex question. 
In one of the letters responding to his 
article, Deborah Barnbaum and Gene 
Pendleton pointed out, “Matthew 
Crawford made it clear that his 
education and résumé afforded him 
a great deal of flexibility.” They also 
pointed out that he decides his own 
hours, rates, and pace: “Had he been 
clocking in and out on a factory floor, 
it is dubious whether he would have 
sung the praises of working with his 
hands,” they added.


Crawford comes out of a 
tradition of writers including Wendell 
Berry and Edward Abbey, who have 
advocated for the ethics and politics

The New Journal of working with one’s hands. Critics have condemned these kinds of arguments as removed from the reality of how manual labor gets accomplished today: namely, by machines or by factory workers in the developing world. And indeed two front page New York Times articles from the past week—“New Wave of Deft Robots is Changing Global Industry” and “Made in Bangladesh: Policing the Garment Industry”—support that argument. Crawford faults the “perversity” of the think tank where he once held a job, but he never engages seriously with the reality of most concrete production methods. At best, he is out of touch; at worst, he perpetuates a dangerous fiction that all manual labor is “good,” and good in the same way.


The politics of highly educated young people engaging in manual labor are complicated, especially where class and money are concerned. The work crew in Sitka was compensated in room and board. All other expenses (including, in my case, a $976.38 roundtrip plane ticket) were our own. I took a month-long job at the Sitka Fine Arts Camp to cover my expenses. Some work crew members spent part of their summer working to finance their trip, but others did not. Work crew jobs certainly could not cover the $2,700 annual student income contribution to financial aid. The economic facts of the project raise questions about whether it was limited to those Yalies who were most financially secure, a complicated twist given the class divide between most Yale graduates and most manual workers.


Is there a disingenuous kind of class voyeurism inherent in elite students engaging in manual labor? There is a host of damaging clichés about manual work—that it’s simple or pure or wholesome—that are important to contend with. I value tremendously the exposure my summers have given me to different viewpoints, lifestyles, and ways of thinking. I also can’t disown the fact that, as someone of enormous educational privilege, I get to choose to do manual work (and usually in beautiful landscapes and cushy circumstances) while many others do so from a lack of alternatives. A friend of mine once said to me, “Laura, people have been struggling to get their hands out of the dirt for hundreds of years. I can’t understand why you are going and putting yours back in.” My parents, a professor and a librarian, support my decisions. But were I from a different background, I imagine they might feel quite differently. Dairanieh, for example, whose family was uprooted from Kuwait during the first Gulf War, has felt pressure from his father to pursue a secure professional field. Working on Allen doesn’t fit neatly into that trajectory. “Why a history major at an Ivy League university would choose to do manual labor during the summer rather than, say, pursue a prestigious NYC internship or dedicate the time for thesis research, was incomprehensible to him,” Dairanieh said.


By looking at manual labor exclusively as “good work,” we fetishize labor in damaging ways. Ideally, one would come away from concrete work caring deeply not only about one’s own capacity for responsibility and patience, but also about issues like safety standards, unionization, and fair pay. Putting on a breathing mask and gloves before stripping lead paint made me think more about exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals than I ever had at Yale. Wearing a hard hat while balancing on a ladder to paint a hard-to-reach bit of window trim made me consider preparation, safety, and consequences. Given that many Yalies will go on to make policy decisions that affect the working lives of others, I think these are important experiences to have. Simply put, the more time people who will be in charge of others spend doing manual labor, the fewer accidents we will have like the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion or the BP oil spill. 


Once I began asking around, I found that a surprising number of Yale students have spent time doing physical work, whether by joining the custodial staff as movers at the end of the semester, volunteering as farmers through WWOOF, or working on a construction crew. Though no one I spoke to planned to pursue a career in those fields, many felt that their experience would influence their professional lives. Ben Singleton ’13 spent the summer between his sophomore and junior years working on a construction crew that built high-end apartments in New York City. This past summer, he held a job that may well allow him to occupy one of those apartments in the future, working at a boutique investment bank. Though the two jobs were so different as to be almost incomparable, he values both as forms of hard work. Along with spending “literally eight hours a day swinging a sledgehammer,” Singleton found a niche for himself as an impromptu translator on the crew. He speaks Spanish and Italian and so could talk easily with his Hispanic, Algerian, and Irish coworkers. The conversations were often eye-opening, as he learned how his co-workers had come to the U.S. and grew to respect how hard they worked. “I’ve sort of grown up in a bubble,” Singleton said. “I’m from the Upper East Side.”


It’s easy to imagine how Singleton could have stayed in that bubble, gliding from Manhattan to Yale to a job on Wall Street. He intends to pursue a career in finance after graduation, but his summer working construction was more than tourism. At the investment bank, he explained, he helped companies raise money and reach long-term goals like building factories and creating job opportunities. Part of why he felt invested in the outcome was that he had spent time with workers who would benefit from the companies’ growth. “Out of Yale, a lot of students end up running companies, taking important roles in management,” Singleton said. “The perspective of the worker is hard to understand if you haven’t worked construction yourself. You don’t fully understand what the lifestyle is like and what are the rules that should govern their employment.” From Singleton’s words, it’s clear that he knows that his work inside “the bubble” will have real implications for real people he respects outside of it.


Perhaps the most substantive thing I’ve learned from my summers is that the divide between physical and mental work is a false one. Much manual labor is highly skilled and requires problem solving just as challenging as crafting a good thesis. Weeding taught me focus and patience that I drew on during long nights in the library. I’ve also been lucky to spend my summers with many different kinds of people who ask different kinds of questions—about knowledge, about goodness, about life and work—than those I hear on campus. I’ve spent months with mechanics, farmers, and construction foremen. I have many friends now to whom the word “Yale” means little. I’ve been reminded that there are innumerable ways to be smart and to contribute, with or without a Yale education.


In theory, concrete work expands the mind rather than limiting it. It admits new perspectives, new habits, new ways of thinking about and solving problems. For me, it created a richer landscape of learning where once I saw only dichotomies: liberal arts versus technical school, mind work versus the trades. I feel committed to giving other people access to this landscape of learning, something that won’t be accomplished by my painting a building all day but which I hope I’ll be able to do with more empathy, intellect, perspective, creativity and, dare I say, integrity, for spending hours with a roller, a wall, and a bucket of paint.


As Schmidt pointed out to me, the work at SJC embodies the cooperative collision of mental and physical work. He explained, “We are restoring the campus so that it can be used for pro-human reasons: education, inspiration, art, culture, and science.” The work of the crew and volunteers at the Sheldon Jackson Campus will eventually give more students access to the world of ideas, artists places to practice, the town of Sitka a more vibrant community art space, scholars a place to gather. Schmidt added, “We need simple, concrete metaphors like this to inspire us and remind us that we can make a difference.” At first I’m surprised to hear how he uses the word metaphor to refer to the physical plant of the campus, as though he has delicately switched the concrete and the abstract worlds. But the more I think about it, the more sense his phrasing makes. A restored campus can be a metaphor for a community coming together. The architecture of a building can be a metaphor for the structure of a poem or a symphony. And as work continues on Sheldon Jackson, as volunteers sand beams, scrape paint, and build roofs, more and more students and artists and writers and thinkers will have a place to build metaphors of their own.

SNAPSHOT
By Eric Boodman
In the summer of 1978, North Haven resident Nancy Alderman and her husband were woken up nightly by a terrible smell wafting through the open windows of their home. One night her husband Myles got in the car to follow the stench to its source. He ended up at the chemical plant of the pharmaceutical manufacturing firm Upjohn, in front of over one hundred smokestacks and vents. “It was two miles from our house, but I had no idea it existed,” Nancy Alderman told me over lunch. The plant was located on the banks of the Quinnipiac River, which would later provide a home for her environmental nonprofit—the Quinnipiac River Fund.


In many ways, the history of the Quinnipiac River Fund mirrors its namesake’s trajectory. Though at its source farther north, the river is a small brook, hardly visible on an aerial map, the river-mouth is impressive—a wide, dock-lined corridor crowded with lobster boats and spanned by a number of heavily-traveled bridges.  The Quinnipiac River Fund asks people to re-imagine their waters.

bridges. The Quinnipiac River Fund’s 
origins are similarly humble, but it 
is now a widely-recognized non-
profit that has financed countless 
environmental research and education 
projects. The non-profit’s existence, 
just like the cleaner water running 
in the Quinnipiac, is a testament 
to Alderman’s devotion to her 
surroundings. 

Her 
environmental 
work has created a community of 
researchers and activists who want 
to change how we interact with 
our landscape. As they continue to 
confront environmental abuses after 
three decades of service, they are 
hoping that helping people develop 
personal relationships with the river 
will encourage them to protect it as 
well. 

Alderman is a straight-talking 
New Englander, and she looks the part, 
with a penchant for thick sweaters and 
engaging eye-contact. She acquired a 
Master’s in Environmental Studies in 
1997 and also serves as the founder 
and president of Environment and 
Human Health, Inc., a Connecticut 
non-profit that researches the effect 
of environmental factors on our 
health. When she and her husband 
discovered the Upjohn plant, she was 
39 and had no such credentials. A stay-
at-home mom who dropped out of 
the Connecticut College for Women, 
she 
entered 
into 
activism as a layman and concerned 
citizen. “At that time, women didn’t 
work,” she told me. “They were meant 
to get married and have children. But 
they did volunteer work in a very 
serious way.” 

A large part of Alderman’s 
volunteer work took root in the days 
immediately following that night as 
she investigated what was going on 
inside the Upjohn factory. She tried to 
find out what kind of chemicals were 
causing the smell, but the managers 
of the factory rebuffed her. “What 
are they? They wouldn’t tell us. What 
are you making? Trade secret,” she 
said. Eventually she found that the 
company’s system of open-air waste 
management allowed the toxins she 
had smelled to be released into both the 
air and water. In 1978, she teamed up 
with the newly founded Connecticut 
Fund for the Environment (CFE), an 
environmental law group that aims 
to ensure that recent environmental 
legislation is enforced. Ignored by 
the local Upjohn administrators, 
Alderman and the founder of the 
CFE, Fred Krupp, took the fight to 
the national level. That meant buying 
enough shares of Upjohn to allow 
them to speak at the company’s annual 
General Meeting at its headquarters in 
Kalamazoo, Michigan. 

“There was no question it was 
David and Goliath,” Alderman said, 
and she worked hard to win the fight. 
After years spent working on the 
case, Alderman and Krupp had won 
the support of 123,680 shareholders, 
whose shares totaled “a market 
value of over seven and one half 
million dollars.” They were backed 
by the United Presbyterian Church 
of America, the City of New Haven 
pension funds, the Union Trust 
Company, which is the third largest 
bank in Connecticut, Yale University, 
and First Bank, she said.

On May 19, 1981, Alderman 
spoke at Upjohn’s annual General 
Meeting. I read a copy of the speech. 
Unexpectedly stirring, it incorporates 
her perspectives both as a shareholder 
of Upjohn and as a resident of North 
Haven. She referred to Upjohn as 
“our company” and to its policies as 
“our policies” while the Connecticut 
air and water remain “our air” and 
“our water” — despite the fact that 
the Quinnipiac River was hundreds 
of miles away from the Kalamazoo 
headquarters.  In front of the meeting 
attendees, she asked:

“How can The Upjohn 
Company expect to sell its 
pharmaceuticals to a trusting 
public when its chemical division 
is acting in such a secretive and 
arbitrary way? If our left hand 
is appearing to make people 
sick, how can we expect people 
to trust our right hand to make 
them well?”


The leaders of Upjohn were 
shocked. The meeting resulted in 
major changes: the North Haven plant 
was shut down, and the court case that 
the CFE and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council had brought against 
the company for not complying with 
its water permit was settled. Upjohn 
had to pay $1.2 million over the course 
of three years, money that established 
a permanent fund administered by the 
Community Foundation of Greater 
New Haven. What began with a 
chemical stench disturbing Alderman’s 
sleep grew into the Quinnipiac River 
Fund. 

Other aspects of the landscape 
of New Haven County bear 
subtle traces of Alderman’s work. 
The Farmington Canal Greenway, a 
recreational path that cuts through 
cities and forests between New 
Haven and Granby, Connecticut, 
on the Massachusetts border, owes 
its existence to her. In 1987, she 
banded with other members of 
her community to prevent a large 
mall from being built in Hamden, 
looking for anything on the site that 
might halt the construction. They 
were hoping for wetlands; instead, 
they found an abandoned railway. It 
followed the route of a canal where 
mules used to plod along a towpath, 
pulling boats towards Northampton. 
With some legal help, Alderman had 
a rail-to-trail project underway, which 
both prevented the building of the 
mall and created the Farmington 
Canal Greenway across the state of 
Connecticut. 

Through 
her 
non-profit 
Environment & Human Health, Inc., 
she has convinced schoolbus drivers 
to turn off their motors when they 
wait for kids, persuaded schools to 
stop using carcinogenic artificial turf, 
and completed the largest study of 
well water in the United States. But 
the project that has brought about the 
most long-term changes—and created 
the widest circle of activists—was 
her work that led to the founding of 
the “Q-River Fund,” as it’s lovingly 
nicknamed. 

My first glimpse of the Quinnipiac 
River was on a cool afternoon in early 
April. I had biked from downtown 
New Haven along Chapel Street, 
through the leafy neighborhood 
around 
Wooster 
Square, 
which 
morphed into towering mounds of 
gravel and sand beside dilapidated 
factories near the Mill River. As I 
crossed the drawbridge over the Mill, 
I saw white cylinders farther up the 
river. Then the industrial landscape 
gradually became abandoned-looking 
houses with faded vinyl siding and an 
enormous Mexican restaurant called 
Guadalupe La Poblanita, empty in the 
early afternoon. 

Coming over a little hill 
where Chapel becomes Front Street, I 
had seemingly crossed into an idyllic 
New England village: just beyond a 
stand of trees was the Quinnipiac 
River, its wide surface flecked with 
white caps, and beyond that a low 
green hill with a white spire. As I biked 
along Quinnipiac River Park, I looked 
at the Victorian houses across the 
river, ending at where Ian Christmann 
lives with his family.

Christmann is a photographer 
and part of Alderman’s community 
of activists. He received funding from 
the Quinnipiac River Fund to create a 
photography exhibit called “Consider 
the Quinnipiac” and in July turned it 
into an online gallery and virtual tour 
of the same name. The Quinnipiac 
River Fund tests water quality, 
measures soil erosion and quantifies 
invertebrate populations, but exists 
primarily to raise awareness about the 
river. 

In living and working along 
the Quinnipiac, Christmann has 
come to know the river intimately. 
He knows that five miles upstream 
it becomes quiet, with no boats, but 
much marshland and the occasional 
low bridge. He knows that half of 
the river’s length is tidal, and that 
fifteen to thirty million tires have 
been illegally dumped in the river near 
North Haven. He has photographed 
hundreds of secret moments of life 
along the river: a swan poking its head 
down into its stick-mound nest, a 
dusting of snow on the tugboats and 
docks, a fisherman looking out from 
the sleet-grey mountain of oyster 
shells on the deck of his boat. “Lots 
of people don’t know this area exists,” 
Christmann told me in his living room, 
which looks out over the Quinnipiac. 

Ironically, this landscape is what 
first attracted the Puritans who set up 
the colony that would become New 
Haven. In 1637, Boston businessman 
Theophilus Eaton received reports 
of “the rich and goodly meadows 
of Quinnipiack” from captains who 
were fighting off the Pequot tribe 
and who hoped that the English 
would capitalize on the river before 
the Dutch did. After visiting the site, 
Eaton sent word to his schoolfriend 
John Davenport that he had no trouble 
imagining it as “a thriving Wilderness 
Zion,” as Rollin G. Osterweis puts 
it in Three Centuries of  New Haven. 
Davenport arrived one year later with 
500 followers. 

Christmann’s 
online 
gallery 
outlines the history of the Quinnipiac, 
explaining how the river remained 
central to the New Haven economy 
well into the 19th century. Its bottom 
was encrusted with jagged oyster beds 
so extensive that the area was known 
as “Clamtown.” The Quinnipiac port 
had a brisk traffic of merchants, 
fishermen and sailors, who called 
New Haven “Dragon” after the “sea 
dragons,” or harbor seals, that fed on 
the river’s fish and mollusks.

When his family first moved to 
New Haven, Christmann explained, 
“nobody was talking about the river. 
We felt there was a negative stigma 
about it.”  Part of that was due to the 
pollution that began with 19th century 
industrialization and continued into 
recent years. Christmann explained 
that people thought the river was 
unsalvageable because it repeatedly 
failed to meet state and national water 
quality standards. Over time, the 
generalized sense of apathy cleared 
the way for more dumping in the river. 
Safety 
was 
also 
an 
issue, 
Christmann said. “Crime levels were 
higher here than downtown.” With 
the river’s reputation tarnished, the 
neighborhood surrounding it became 
less desirable and more dangerous. 
People whose families might once 
have been closely involved with the 
river moved away, or retreated into 
their homes, disengaging from the 
community. So Christmann felt it was 
important that his project organize 
itself around locals reclaiming the 
river from different angles.  

“Our intent was that people 
upstream and downstream learn 
about the conditions, both good and 
bad,” Christmann said, explaining 
that the fund took the exhibit on tour 
along the riverbanks, from town hall 
to library to town hall, ending up in 
the Connecticut State Capitol building 
in Hartford. “It was great to have 
decision-makers see the exhibit,” he 
added. He seemed hopeful.

Although 
Alderman 
and 
Christmann 
both 
expressed 
worry for the health of the river, one 
activist in their community stands 
out for his extreme view on our 
relationship to nature, arguing that 
it may be too late to create a healthy 
environment.  Since 2000, physician 
Jerry Silbert has been the executive 
director of the Watershed Partnership, 
an environmental organization that 
has spearheaded multiple projects 
relating to the Quinnipiac River, some 
financed by the Q-River Fund.  Despite 
his success at getting several kinds of 
carcinogenic chemicals banned from 
being used on school lawns, he think 
it’s too late to undo the damage we’ve 
done to our environment.  He says 
we should be focusing on “how to 
maintain a semblance of civilization” 
in the face of the ever-worsening 
environmental crisis.  “Nature doesn’t 
negotiate, it just responds, and I think 
that response will be very harsh,” he 
told me over the phone, explaining that 
we now need to think about providing 
food through local infrastructure so 
that we are not relying on systems that 
require fossil fuels when those systems 
collapse. “I applaud the sentiment of 
sustainability, but I think one has to 
look critically at whether what one is 
doing is window-dressing or putting a 
band-aid on a hemorrhaging artery.”

He is particularly frustrated at 
how governments are doing next to 
nothing for the environment, and at 
how “the captains of industry don’t 
recognize what’s happening.”  That 
disconnect exists on a worldwide 
scale, not just in New Haven County. 
Even with increased interest in the 
Quinnipiac since the inception of 
the Fund, the river has still been 
making headlines for its precarious 
condition.  In January, local paper The 
Record-Journal reported that the Cytec 
chemical plant in Wallingford, just 
blocks from the river, had been listed 
as the second biggest releaser of toxic 
waste in the state of Connecticut.  
And on July 31, The Hartford Courant 
reported a fire in a forging plant in 
Southington.  Over 1000 gallons of 
oil are thought to have drained into 
the Quinnipiac. These events validate 
Silbert’s feeling that parties at all levels 
have to be engaged in protecting the 
environment.

That got me thinking about how 
interest in the Quinnipiac River is 
transferred from one person to the 
next. Educators and artists need to 
care to get residents thinking about 
the river; residents need to care to 
help make the lobbies successful at 
changing legislation; lawmakers need 
to care to listen to the lobbies; law-
enforcers have to care to uphold new 
legislation; heads of industry need 
to care to actually change practices 
instead of looking for loopholes. You 
can string all those players together 
in any number of different webs, 
but it will always end up an intricate 
codependency.

Wherever Alderman, Christmann, 
and Silbert fit into that chain, there is 
no question that they have all inserted 
themselves into the ecosystem of 
the river to try to generate more care 
and interest.  Yet I can imagine how 
associating yourself so closely with a 
river can make you as vulnerable to 
changes as the water and the bank. 
Over thirty years ago, Alderman was 
awakened by a bad smell; now she 
needs something to rouse others.

Sometime during the second or 
third week of your publishing in­
ternship, your boss swivels away 
from her monitor and asks, “How do 
you feel about romance?”
You don’t feel anything anymore. 
You have been photocopying foreign 
contracts for days, and this has made 
you numb. Peering meekly from be­
hind a fortress of overstuffed manila 
files, you repeat, inanely, “Romance?”
Her gaze has already returned to her 
email. “Yeah. Regency.”
You do feel something about 
this genre; some might call it “antipa­
thy.” While you grope for the words 
to express that romance is not, um, 
your favorite thing, a ream of paper 
is dumped into your arms, still warm 
from the office printer. Someone’s 
baby. Your first client manuscript.


On the commute, put aside your 
pious Anna Karenina and pull out 
the Regency romance. Your mouth is 
grim. You’ll find that within the first 
two chapters, the duke senses that he 
could come to love this impudent chit, 
and though she thinks him a cold-
hearted rake, she feels an unwilling at­
traction. They collide on a windswept 
moor outside the estate. An ankle 
gets twisted, a skirt ruined, and they 
fall muddily into each others’ arms. 
Gently, he tilts her face up. They kiss, 
their horses looking on approvingly. 
Throughout, you make broad notes 
in the margins in red ink, punctuated 
by gleeful underlines and spluttering 
question marks. Fly through the story, 
rifling through until at last you turn 
over the final page, look out the win­
dow, and see the parking lot of your 
stop.


Your instructions are simple: 
write up a brief summary and analy­
sis. Always lead with the verdict—do 
you recommend this manuscript for 
acceptance? Explain your reasoning. 
Make suggestions, providing quotes 
and citing page numbers. And be nice: 
this person might be our client, so 
there’s no point in being nasty. The 
agent might want to use your critiques 
in their editorial notes. Sternly, your 
supervisor warns that a reader’s report 
is not supposed to be beautiful prose.


Re-read your notes. Reluctantly 
rein in the snark. The villain’s revenge 
scheme is confusing, you opine, and 
he could probably kidnap the lady 
without stealing the identity of a dead 
naval officer and blackmailing a saucy 
tavern wench. The banter between the 
lovers needs to be cut in half. And per­
haps the word “sexy” should be used 
more sparingly, given the novel’s his­
torical setting. 


In the spirit of “being nice,” 
write how you enjoyed the archery 
scenes and many of the supporting 
characters, which is true—you’re a 
sucker for a precocious little sister or 
an unexpectedly-progressive dowager. 
Swaddle your critiques in qualifiers, 
padding each sentence with a “per­
haps” or a “sometimes.” Before hit­
ting send, add, “Improvements could 
be made to the relationship’s pace. It 
develops a little too quickly.”


This represents an upgrade from 
your first days at the office, in 
which you wrestled with the type­
writer, played gopher, pushed paper. 
You can’t believe this office has a 
typewriter. Your tour of the extensive 
and color-coded files (“Interns often 
find it helpful to draw a map,” your 
supervisor suggests) ends at the intern 
desk, where the slush pile of unsolic­
ited queries is contained—for now—
in the large drawer to your left. You 
flick through the envelopes, which are 
stamped with earnestly excessive post­
age. The oldest has languished for a 
month and a half. This pleases your 
supervisor. “We’re pretty ahead!” she 
remarks cheerfully.


Your job is to bump the hope­
fuls from this particular ring of pur­
gatory, sorting them into Yeses, Nos, 
and Maybes. Your boss will check your 
work, but she provides some helpful 
guidelines: historical fiction should be 
pegged to immediately recognizable 
figures and events, or else it doesn’t 
sell. A thriller should elevate your 
heart-rate by the tenth or fifteenth 
page, or else it doesn’t sell. Nonfic­
tion should have a platformed author, 
or else it doesn’t sell. Literary fiction 
doesn’t sell. 


What does sell is romance, ap­
proximately $1.368 billion of it per 
year.


Interns generally come up with a 
40:60 ratio of nos to yeses and may­
bes, your supervisor informs you, but 
eventually your ratio should shift to 
70:30. Smile. She underestimates your 
ruthlessness.


For your part, you have underes­
timated the lengths to which people 
will go to secure an agent: the sample 
chapters painstakingly bound in plas­
tic covers, the mix CDs and original 
soundtracks, the occasional, perplex­
ing headshot. Your supervisor sees fit 
to mention that the agency doesn’t ac­
cept anyone who sends hand-written 
letters. Or anyone in prison. These 
additional rules eliminate more manila 
than you’d expect. 


The next manuscript lands you 
back in bodice-ripping England, 
with another eligible earl, another 
ravishing young debutante. Anna Kar­
enina is deadweight in your backpack 
on your daily speed-walk through 
Midtown.


Over time you gather a vast lexi­
con of the tics of Romance, but in­
explicably, you’re immune to irritation. 
As you encounter them, you greet 
these clichés like old friends: child­
hood 
friends-turned-lovers, 
ladies 
compromised on balconies, yawning 
gambling debts, deranged kidnap­
pings in the final act. Eventually you 
graduate to other worlds: Gilded Age, 
steampunk, super-hero. A nonfiction 
proposal and mystery cross your desk, 
but do not break your stride.


This is how the genre does so 
well—its readers want comfort, not 
novelty, and they will return again 
and again for the minute yet endless 
variations which each story can offer. 
There’s a subgenre for everyone, each 
a thriving fiefdom unto itself: urban 
fantasy and paranormal, suspense and 
small-town, inspirational (i.e., Chris­
tian) and erotic, historical and “eth­
nic.” There are even series centered 
on characters’ professions, like “Har­
lequin Medical Romance” or “Stories 
set in the World of NASCAR.” Ro­
mances can be consumed in fistfuls, 
like M&Ms, a habit enabled by the 
e-reader, which razed the biggest bar­
riers to consumption: embarrassment 
and difficulty of access. These books 
are priced to entice the impulse buyer: 
$5.99, $4.99, with a novella tossed in 
for free. In the digital age, no one has 
to wait for another fix. You are getting 
the raw stuff.


Abruptly, you’re given a “special 
project”: a full manuscript that 
had been sitting in the inbox for a few 
months. Not a romance.


It’s good. The beginning is messy. 
Its seams show. The scenes are layered 
in a way that makes the pace groan for­
ward by inches. But the characters are 
alive, and for the first time that sum­
mer, you sit on the train and re-read a 
line, just to feel it hit you again. It’s al­
ways difficult to articulate why you like 
a given piece of art; it’s even harder 
when it’s not quite art yet. People talk 
a lot about love, but liking something 
is its own weirdly strong feeling. You 
think this story will speak to someone. 
You think it speaks to you.


You heartily recommend it for 
acceptance.


Despite yourself, you’re a little in 
love.


If the publishing industry has been 
gutted, no one has told the writers. 
Each day brings a fresh batch of query 
letters to add to the slush. The writers 
introduce themselves and their writing 
backgrounds, tell you about their fam­
ilies and hobbies. A speed date where 
you have all the power.


Occasionally it may occur to 
you—briefly, horrifyingly—that you 
are more likely to take a chance on a 
sweet query than any of the real live 
human romantic prospects of your re­
cent past. Ignore this. 


Doggedly chip at the slush pile. 
It’s cathartic to clear out the desk, 
though you hold out hope that you’ll 
find something. Fish out a few pro­
posals that look promising, nervously 
turning them over for inspection. 
Your supervisor rifles through, look­
ing deeply unimpressed, though she 
says she’ll take a look at them soon.


“From now on,” she adds, “You 
can just send out your rejections. You 
don’t have to run them by me. All of 
your nos have been spot-on.”


Not so much with your yeses, but 
damned if you will stop trying. In the 
last week, you feel like you’ve hit a vein 
of gold. In the slush pile, you pull out 
three or four decent options: a mem­
oir or two, a dystopian road novel, a 
New England woman’s fiction which, 
if you squint at it right, could conceiv­
ably be an Oprah’s Book Club pick. 
You are willing to overlook almost all 
faults. Their mistakes will be caught by 
the agent, or in editorial. Anything can 
be fixed. You are desperate for variety.


Yet in your heart, you know that 
if you saw these books in a bookshop, 
you can’t imagine you’d look twice. 
Wonder if, in the publishing world, 
you’ve become a whore with a heart 
of gold.


In an e-mail, a writer friend com­
plains about some “love story for 
adults” she’s been duped into trying, 
a bestseller far more up-market than 
anything resting on your bedside table. 
She jokes, “Do you ever get that fear 
that if you read enough bad prose it’ll 
get trapped in your ear, and you’ll start 
writing it? Horror of horrors!” 


Actually, you fear that you’ve 
forgotten how to read. After four se­
mesters of high-fiber, nutrient-dense 
hits of the literary canon, you had 
become a vocal advocate for cultural 
omnivorism. These days, you feel your 
slush diet eroding your palate, your 
appetite, your metabolism.


Painfully bore through your great 
Russian novel, never gaining enough 
momentum to absorb the text. You 
begin to resent the physical heaviness 
of it, just as an object. When it falls 
off your lap on the train, you wake 
with a start. Picking it up, imagine typ­
ing up a few recommendations for 
Tolstoy, in that peculiarly sunny voice 
you’ve come to own. “While I found 
the characters sympathetic (particu­
larly Anna and Kitty!) the novel has 
a few major structural problems with 
regards to its pace. While the inter­
related cast of characters is balanced 
deftly, the prose takes lengthy detours 
into farming practices and party vot­
ing procedures, and these grow some­
what dry at times. The book might 
also benefit from more fleshed-out 
and explicit scenes between Anna and 
Vronsky. As it stands, the interlude 
marked by the ellipse in Part One feels 
jarring and dissatisfying, especially 
since such ellipses do not occur else­
where in the book. It feels accidental, 
then coy.” 


Consider throwing yourself off 
the Aberdeen-Matawan platform as 
penance.


The manuscript you were rooting 
for is nixed. With terrible kind­
ness, your supervisor deems the novel 
unfixable: too much narrative distance, 
confusing chronology. You’re not sure 
what “narrative distance” means, but 
you swallow her explanation. 


It’s a heart-breaker. She asks that 
you draft a form rejection, with a nice 
note to say that the agency would 
be happy to look at future work, the 
agency equivalent of “I don’t think 
this will work out, but I hope we can 
still be friends.” 


On the 6:31 p.m. express out 
of Penn Station, entertain yourself 
by spying on your fellow passengers. 
This is the summer of Fifty Shades of 
Grey. You are impressed by any novel 
that threatens to unseat Angry Birds 
as the commuter’s diversion of choice. 
They can’t hide from you, these young 
women folding back the paper cover, 
the businessmen hunched surrepti­
tiously over their Kindles.


Like everyone else, develop opin­
ions on the book without having ac­
tually read it—its deadening prose, its 
Cinderella story so weirdly evacuated 
of eroticism—but your feelings lack 
the same bile. Honestly, you’re just a 
little bit dazzled. Who are you to ar­
gue with a book that has earned $50 
million for its author in six months? 
The people have spoken. It sells. And 
it sells film rights, soundtracks, and 
condoms. 


Good romance novels are all 
alike; every bad romance novel is 
bad in its own way. Keep reading the 
manuscripts as they roll in. You have 
become a mechanic of baroque Rube 
Goldberg machines, the characters 
spinning like sawtooth gears and ex­
traneous plots rattling cheerfully, wait­
ing for your tightening wrench, a little 
extra weight. You work with what you 
have. It soothes you to take a look un­
der the hood and make it right, so that 
after an hour or so you can step back 
and say, “It ain’t pretty, but it’ll get you 
from Point A to Point B.” 


The end of the summer leaves 
you ambivalent about the book busi­
ness. After months on the inside, you 
have come to understand the alien­
ation that aspiring writers feel from 
the publishing industry — their sense 
that the gatekeepers’ choices are so in­
scrutable and idiosyncratic that they’re 
essentially arbitrary. You made your 
choices, guided by well-meaning men­
tors, according to prevailing industry 
logic. But you know the imperative 
to sell lucrative schlock in order to fi­
nance the elusive gem would eventu­
ally grind you down.


Finish your Tolstoy, which ends, 
to your surprise, not with Anna in 
the wheels but Levin under the stars. 
Don’t read at all for a few days.

              ENDNOTE
A Conversation with 
David Samuels
The New York Times called David 
Samuels “an elite narrative journalist, a 
master at teasing out the social and moral 
implications of  the smallest small talk.” 
He is a contributing editor at Harper’s 
Magazine and writes for The New 
Yorker and The Atlantic. He sat down 
with The New Journal at Theresa’s Polish 
Restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, where he 
lives with his two children.
The New Journal: You write on a sort 
of rotation between Harper’s Magazine, 
The New Yorker, and The Atlantic. How 
does that approach inform your work?
David Samuels: At this point these 
places have all become like different 
instruments that are available to me. 
Do I want to play the guitar? What 
kind of guitar? The violin? I get 
flexibility and pleasure from being 
able to play different instruments 
in different places. Without entirely 
meaning to, I ended up with some real 
mastery of this very specific form – 
the long American magazine article. It 
ain’t Shakespeare’s plays or the grand 
19th century novel. On the other hand 
it’s the one indigenous American 
literary form, and it strikes me as 
having no more or no less absolute 
literary potential than the sestina, say.
TNJ: You recently wrote an article for 
Harper’s about a strange undercurrent 
of racism – a sort of desire to 
eliminate the messiness of the real 
world – at the Bronx Zoo. Talk about 
your process with that piece.
DS: If there’s a human value that I’m 
trying to get across in my work, it’s 
about an integration of thinking and 
feeling where feeling comes first.
Part of what I want readers to 
take from my work is the value of not 
knowing everything in advance, and 
not thinking that you do.  Another 
part is the willingness and ability to 
be emotionally and intellectually open 
without feeling superior. I think that 
those values are largely absent from 
the culture of smart people who went 
to good universities who pretend to 
know all this stuff they actually have 
very limited real-world experience of. 
That sense of entitlement to 
the experience of others has always 
rubbed me the wrong way, in part 
because I’m not a person who has a 
lot of confidence in my knowledge 
of things I haven’t seen or felt. The 
inherent assumption that I belonged 
to a common milieu with the people 
I went to school with, was the source 
of a lot of pain and anger for me in 
the course of my own Ivy League 
education and afterwards, because I 
never actually felt like I belonged, or 
like I wanted to belong. I think I’ve 
found a relatively sophisticated way to 
express that hurt and that anger, but 
that is still the underlying animus of 
my work.  So I have always trusted 
to this process of serendipity when I 
choose subjects.
With the zoo piece, I was going 
through a rough time in my life. I felt 
my marriage come apart, and I had 
two children who I loved very much. 
One of the ways I dealt with this was 
to take my son to the zoo. It was a big 
strange park with tigers and giraffes in 
the middle of the Bronx, and it was a 
form of escape that I could share with 
my child. But there’s something weird 
about looking at all these animals 
in cages. Why do I want to do that? 
What am I really showing him about 
the world, and about me? What is 
this communication about and how 
creepy is it that I’m doing this? I didn’t 
understand it.  I just had these feelings 
about it. 


39
TNJ: What finally led you to see the 
weirdness in the zoo?
DS: I was sitting in the zoo library, 
which took about three months for 
them to get me access to. The second 
or third day, I noticed this creepy 
oil portrait of a handsome man 
with a mustache peering at me from 
between some bookshelves. His name 
was Madison Grant. I discovered 
that he was the leading racist of 
early 20th-century America and the 
sort of godfather of eugenics and 
immigration restrictions. He also was 
the creator of the zoo and ran it for 
forty years. Suddenly I was like “Oh, 
the Bronx Zoo was founded by one 
of the more evil people to live in 20th 
century America.” He was also deeply 
involved with the racist German 
scientists who set up Auschwitz. So I 
realized that there was something very 
dark that was woven into the history 
and conception of this place—but it 
took a long time to find that thread. 
All I had to go on was what I felt and 
the fact that I wasn’t willing to allow 
my purely rational faculties to shut 
off what I was actually feeling in that 
place.
TNJ: How do you feel about the state 
of magazine journalism today?
DS: I believe the catastrophe has 
already happened. The magazine 
world I entered almost twenty years 
ago was a broad, commercially-viable 
industry with a long and distinguished 
history. For a reasonably large 
audience of people, it was a fun way to 
spend two hours in the afternoon, as 
an alternative to TV and other forms 
of entertainment. That world is gone. 
And yet in some ways, I feel 
more optimistic about the form now 
that the world I grew up with is gone. 
I can look at the form now and feel 
that things are changing -- that’s 
there’s going to be a marriage of the 
technology and the form I grew up 
with that may be even better in its mix 
of creative potential and audience and 
money. Long-form non-fiction, or 
literary journalism, or whatever you 
call it has been a vital American form 
for 150 years, and it’s already survived 
a number of technological shifts. 
Each time, the form has become more 
robust. 
TNJ: You come from an orthodox 
Jewish background. How does that 
background affect your observations 
of American culture?
DS: The Jewishness of my work is 
inherent in the posture I take and in 
my choices of subjects. I’m the first 
American in my family. I have the 
intensity of interest in American life 
of a typical first-generation immigrant. 
It’s like Bernard Malamud’s novel The 
Natural. He’s as Jewish a writer as there 
is, and yet he writes this great baseball 
novel that doesn’t have anything 
overtly Jewish in it at all. In some 
sense, the intensity of his imagination 
of The Natural depended on his feeling 
that the thing that he was imagining 
was radically other what he was – 
something marvelous and strange 
and threatening. I think that a similar 
sense of distance and identification 
characterizes all my writing about 
America. Barack Obama’s not me; 
Mitt Romney’s not me; Kanye West’s 
not me. I find emotional resonances 
in all my subjects but there’s a distance 
there that comes from the fact that 
I’m situated elsewhere. When I think 
of myself in the larger sweep of some 
historical continuity, I think of myself 
as a writer first, and I think of myself 
as a Jew.
