**Title: The Imitation of Mayor Daley**
**Author: William Marshall**
**Page number(s): 3-4**

When Richard C. Lee announced his retirement from politics in 1969, many who knew him were convinced that only retirement could save his life. During his sixteen years as mayor of New Haven, Lee had wrought tremendous physical changes in the city, and the sheer effort of the badgering of state and federal officials, the selling of the programs locally, and the publicizing of the old programs in anticipation of the new programs that were always ready in the wings had itself wrought tremendous changes in Lee. In 1967 he was too ill even to campaign extensively for re-election, and by the time of the inauguration of his successor, Lee was frail and old well beyond his 53 years. 

However, two years out of public office seemed to have served as a remarkable tonic for him. He still could be observed gobbling antacid pills as he waited to deliver his review of Mike Royko's Boss, but he looked younger and healthier than he had in years. 

The New Haven public library made a good match when it paired Lee and Boss. The parallels between Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago and Mayor Richard Lee are striking. Daley is fond of highways and monuments (preferably in the form of high-rise apartment buildings) to his abilities as a redeveloper. Lee has faced charges which have the same ring in terms of his support for the luxury high-rises of the Oak Street Redevelopment Project, Route 34, and the New Haven Coliseum. 

Miss Wilder of "Friends of the Library" noted further parallels as she introduced him: born and raised in an "Irish ethnic enclave," entered politics fresh out of high school, experienced "civil disorders" as mayor of an American city, and channeled millions of dollars of federal money into major renewal projects. Miss Wilder did make two distinctions, however, which in her mind made Lee emerge the better man. While Daley had ordered police to shoot to kill and maim during Chicago's 1968 disorders, Lee had settled New Haven's 1967 flare-up without a shot being fired. And finally, Daley had procured only $80 million in federal money during the 1950's, while Lee had scrambled for $95 million.

**Title: A cop may throw the book at you,**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

Larom Munson, director of the Munson Gallery on Orange Street and a police commissioner for the City of New Haven, stood at the podium in the basement auditorium of the United Church on the Green. It was 12:10 and the 150 people who had come to hear Police Chief Biagio DeLieto review Albert Reiss' The Police and the Public were getting nervous. The New Haven Public Library had designed their "Books Sandwiched In" program for lunch hour enlightenment, and many in the crowd had exactly that: one hour. Now, ten minutes of it were gone and they had not been enlightened one bit. There were of course many retirees in attendance, who had nothing but time, and there were also several leading yankee attorneys, who had nothing but money and therefore, if the converse of the old saw is true, a great deal of time also. But many of the people were in fact secretaries and had to get back to the office. 

Somehow the gold cross on the podium did not seem inappropriate for Munson, a man so obviously at peace as to be at least ordained, and possibly divine. He might well have passed for a Groton and Harvard educated priest and certainly did not resemble the cunning grafter that former Police Chief Ahern had implied he was the night before. Munson introduced the speaker: "Biagio DeLieto, as New Raven's chief of police, has made himself extremely visible in the community. This is is one in a series of efforts to present himself, and through himself, the police department." The chief sat at a table behind Commissioner Munson and shuffled his papers as his past achievements were enumerated for the audience. 

Biagio DeLieto thought he should have been New Raven's police chief in 1967. He had one of the best efficiency ratings in the department, he had earned something of a reputation as an innovator in police training procedures, and he had been with the force since 1946. Arthur T. Barbieri, the Democratic town chairman, also wanted Biagio to be chief. That in itself may have been enough to eliminate the possibility of appointment in the days of Mayor Richard C. Lee; but, in any event, Lee appointed James F. Ahern, and the rest is history. 

Ahern, prematurely gray and preternaturally liberal, went on to become the best known police chief outside of Philadelphia. Like his patron, Lee, Ahern quickly got on the Federal gravy train, pouring thousands of dollars from the Safe Streets and Crime Control Acts into re-studying the role of the police and re-organizing the department along lines dictated by the study. Even the policemen themselves could tell that there was a change in the air. Under Chief Ahern, officers were allowed to smoke (tobacco) on duty and mustaches were permitted with the personal approval of the chief. Ahern played a good game, taking credit for keeping May Day cool, getting appointed to the President's Commission on campus unrest, and appearing with Kingman Brewster on the Dick Cavett Show. 

Meanwhile, Biagio DeLieto, or "Benny" or "Biggy" or "Bags," depending on your degree of familiarity with the captain of the communications division, spent four years being introduced at Melebus Club (Barbieri's bomb shelter on Olive Street, where most of the real business of the city is conducted these days) testimonial dinners as "ladies and gentlemen, the man who should have been police chief of New Haven ... " At times, even the testimonial dinners were not enough and DeLieto considered taking advantage of the police early retirement program. But he hung on and, in so doing, proved once again that patience is oft rewarded. In November 1969, the voters of New Haven decided to throw the rascals in and, approximately one year after the inauguration of Bartholomew F. Guida as mayor, DeLieto was indeed the chief. 

Ahern had departed in a cloud of alleged political continued on page 5
