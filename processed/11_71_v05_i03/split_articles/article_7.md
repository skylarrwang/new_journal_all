**Will Groucho Marx join the revolution?**
**Author: Lawrence Ellenberg**
**Page number(s): 7-8**

When the movie ends, does it end? 
flesh, running around the stage. Other 
than these facts, the relevant details of 
the Marx Brothers are precisely part of 
their tone and spirit. We must admit from 
from the start that we cannot recreate 
their idiosyncratic talents. For that 
matter, even if we were able to do so 
(as was attempted in Minnie's Boys in 
New York), the essential point in a 
serious re-creation would still revolve 
around tone and spirit. 

The Rep, under Robert Brustein's 
direction, has, to a certain extent, 
captured the Marx Brothers' spirit 
quite well. Dick Sbawn"s performance 
as Wolfgang Amadeus Gutbucket, that 
is, as the Groucho character, is simply 
brilliant. Lonnie Carter bas been quite 
clever in his juxtaposition of two perme-
ating American myths, that of the .. big 
house, .. or as I Jiriaht haw preferred 
"hi& home,•• the American pn.on which 
holds us aD, and Hollywood, our sbared 
and collectiwly c:onsc:ious fantasy 
worJcl. 

There is, however, a stumblina bloct 
here, and that is the Marx Brothen 
themselves. Lonnie Carter's notion is 
a good one. The political message is 
clear. There is a dissonance between our 
dreams and our reality, between "Gold-
diggers" and the "big house." Both 
have trapped us, and both must be 
exploded. Walls and tinsel must come 
down. Who is more likely to do the job, 
Carter must have said to himself, than 
those mythic anarchists, those brothers 
Marx (who may be unrelated to Karl, 
but whose instincts are just as revolu-
tionary). 

The Marx Brothers, however, as 
myth, cannot bear the weight of 
politics. The problem with 1"he BW 
Hmue is that it is a Marx Brothen 
scenario with serious intentions. whidl 
is to say that it is self-contradictory. 
The play uses cinema as a continuous 
metaphor, yet the Marx Brothers were 
not cinematic. '11u! BW Howe forces 
political substance upon an anarchy 
which remained, fcx the Marx Brotben, 
always stylistic. 

The Marx Brothers mow4 from 
ftUdeYille to Jeaitimate theater ....... 
they had alienated B.F. Albee, who 
controlled the best vaudeville houses. 
In search of a stage, they fell into 
Broadway. The move into movies was 
just as mechanical. Sound arrived at the 
right time, and movies meant more 
money, less work, and a bigger audience. 
It was as logical a step as Groucho's 
later move into television, and was made 
with as little artistic pretnse. Yet the 
'Marx Brothers' popularity on Broadway 
and in the cinema was in spite of these 
forms. They always remained the bead-
line vaudeville act, and though they 
were framed into a plot, be it play or 
scenario, they constantly fought against 
it. Thalberg was right to try out their 
movies on the vaudeville stage. 

The Rep bas m.isUkenly focused on 
the form of the film med.ium, whidl is 
the one thin& about it whi<:h the Marx 
Brothers resisted. Furthermore, The BW 
HOtUe delineates good guys and bad 
JUYS; for the Marx Brothers no sudl 
value judameot could be made. Values 
and their inevitable derivative, politics. 
would haw subverted the Marx ·Brothers' total irreverence. There is 
something not so laughably reverent 
about The Big House. 

The Big House is most interesting, 
perhaps, as an illustration of something 
which is happening in the theater today. 
The Marx Brothers, as we know, took 
essentially stage vehicles and techniques 
and brought them into the movies. In 
this, they were typical. The American 
journey has traditionally been from 
east to west. and as with settlement, so 
with theatrical/cinematic properties. 
There is a long heritage of Broadway 
shows being adapted by the Hollywood 
dream factory. Everyone's work. from 
Rodgers and Hammerstein to Eugene 
O'Neill, has made this journey west. 
Now, just as America has begun to 
look east (to VietNam) and Captain 
America has taken his trip from the 
Pacific to the Atlantic (Easy Rider), so 
the traditions of adaptation and 
influence have been reversed in the 
theatrical/cinematic world. Broadway 
now feeds on the movies. In the last few 
years we have seen a TONY award 
winning musical, Applause, adapted 
from Hollywood's All About Eve, as 
well as a number of misguided shows 
based on Elmer Gantry, Georgy Girl, and 
and even La Strada. More insidious, 
however, in its own way, has been the 
movies' effect on more serious play-
wrights' imaginations. 

Movies have made their way into the 
theater in two particularly subversive 
channels. The fust is technical, at least 
in origin. We see a frustration on the 
part of young playwrights at not having 
access on the stage to jump-cuts, close-
ups, and sound editing. The result has 
been, at its best, theatrical fragmenta-
tion, and at its worst, recapitulation of 
movie devices on the stage. Maria Irene 
Fornes, for example, has successfully 
used the movie cut as a stage technique. 
Her plays refuse to be localized; scenes 
flow from one into the next. Terence 
McNally, even in so flawed a work as 
Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?, has 
used flashbacks and fragmentation in a 
valid theatrical manner. However, when 
in a work like The Big House we see 
strobe-flickers used for a gratuitous 
silent-screen effect, and when we see 
mugging at the edge of the apron for 
invalid close-ups, we wonder what the 
movies are doing for or to the stage. 

The second influence, a more serious 
one, is in the realm of matter, not 
method, and it is related to myth. 
America's mythic resources have always 
been minor in comparison with its more 
ancient European cultural rivals. There 
is a vast difference between Daniel 
Webster and St. Joan, and we have 
suffered because our hero is the former. 
Now, however, our movies have 
provided us with a seemingly rich 
mythology: Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn 
Monroe, the Marx Brothers. Even Ruby 
Keeler has taken on mythic proportions, 
and thousands flock to No, No, Nanette 
to worship her. 

The problem with our Hollywood 
myths is not that they are neither 
valid nor rich. but that they are not 
ready to be used. They are not fully 
digested; they remain uncomfortably 
close in time and therefore ambiguous. 
It is easy for a playwright to dress a 
character in derby, cane, and floppy 
shoes- he knows the audience's 
response will be to click Chaplin. 
Unfortunately, it is too easy and too 
frequently done. The click is not easy 
to gauge. Chaplin is a contemporary; 
his associations are not generalized yet. 
Too many people know him, not 
through revivals, but through his origi-
nal releases. He is still too much of a 
celebrity to be a myth, too much, 
indeed, of a person. We must know our 
myths only at great distance, and we 
are not yet distanced enough from any 
of our Hollywood heros. 

There is a speech by Groucho in 
Animal Crackers which gets right to the 
heart of the matter ... Do you know 
what this country needs today?" he 
asks. "A seven-<:ent nickeL Yessiree, 
we've been using the f"'tve-cent nickel in 
this country since 1492, and that's 
pretty near a hundred years' daylight 
saving. Now why not give the seven-«nt 
nickel a chance? If it works out, next 
year we could have an eigbt-<:ent nickeL 
Think what that would mean. You could
could go to the newsstand, buy a three-
cent newspaper and get the same nickel 
back again. One nickel carefully used 
would last a family a lifetime!" 

Our movie figures are still only five-
cent nickels, or seven-cent ones at their 
inflated best. The theater, with its 
ancient history, has for a long time 
been trading in dollar nickels. Bringing 
the movies into theater at this time 
seems to me to be an uncomfortable 
deflation.•
