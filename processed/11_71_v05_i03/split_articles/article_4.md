He said that his review would be defensive. That was 
it. Nobody was going to catch him covering up for his 
own failures by pretending not to recognize them in 
others. He wasn't going to. pretend anything. He had 
made mistakes and Daley had made mistakes, but in the 
long run, ~he voters bore them both out. As he had 
always done everything else, Lee vigorously assailed the 
task of review. 
" He [Royko) charges Daley with hypocrisy, autoc-
racy, arrogance, petulance, high-handedness, indiffer-
ence, ignorance, and vindictiveness ... Dick Daley may be 
guilty of all these things; l'm-sure he's guilty of at least 
some. But the City of Chicago is made up of four million 
people. Daley has been mayor for sixteen years and last 
spring, when he ran for his fifth term, he was elected by 
72% of the vote. He must be doing something right." 
He went on to describe what: the world's busiest air-
port, the world's largest convention hall, and parking 
garages downtown, all under Daley's management. 
Royko suggests that in Chicago all of these things have 
been accomplished at the expense of the people. In the 
past five years in New Haven, the same suggestions have 
been made, the same claim that bulldozer renewal has 
prevailed at the expense of the average citizen and for 
the profit of the private entrepreneur. But Lee would 
not back down from his sixteen years. According to 
his statistics, Chicago has all of the monuments, as well 
as a family income 30 per cent above the national 
average. 
"The Old Man" continued in his personable way. 
Granted, Daley had a reputation for tampering with the 
electoral process, but, "whatever his reason was, he did 
support good people." He had made certain that Jack 
Kennedy carried Illinois, "on what wings, I will not 
discuss." Then there were the anecdotes. Kennedy, 
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and Daley, all clinging 
to a life raft which would only hold one person. They 
vote to see who will survive. Daley wins 11 -2. The 
audience laughed. They loved him. The week before, 
they had been polite to Delieto, but they loved Lee. 
Many of his old associates were present: Joel Cogen, 
former executive director of the Redevelopment 
Agency; Charles Gill, former alderman and himself a 
mayoral contender in 1969; Charlie Parker, campaign 
manager for Hank Parker in 1971. Even a group of 
students which had entered the auditorium. armed with 
notes and apparently eager for questions. seemed to be 
swayed. 
Lee charged that the book was unfair. Royko had not 
only challenged Daley's politics, but also his family life 
and religion. And Lee was right. If anything, Boss

renewal. 
suffers from its own excesses of vitriol. Royko's Daley 
can do nothing without malice aforethought. And 
Royko himself is so consumed by his hatred for Daley 
that it twists his own vision. Ethnic neighborhoods are 
the bigoted, racist fiefdoms of bully gangs when they 
produce Richard Daley. They are charming little self-
determining colonies when Daley obliterates them in 
favor of a University of Illinois campus. Boss' picture of 
. Daley is.so one-sided as to be slapstick. This makes the 
book both delightful to read and ineffective as a politi-
cal weapon. 
But Lee couldn't be just right in his appraisal of the 
book. He had to bring the crowd not only into agree-
ment, but into support. He had to control, and he knew 
how. He cited Royko's use of quotations from William 
Kunstler's cross-examination of Daley during the 
Chicago Conspiracy trial. At the mention of the name 
Kunstler, the audience let out a gasp. Now, that was 
unfair. As he had always managed to do, Lee had now 
won them over. 
He did not try to whitewash Daley, however. Lee 
took the mayor of Chicago to task for his racism, his 
nepotism, and his tolerance of criminals in public office. 
He deplored the 1968 "shoot-to-kill" order and the 
activities surrounding the Democratic convention. But 
he also cited the shortcomings of other mayors, short-
comings which could be equally fatal to the functioning 
of a large city, such as John Lindsay's " inability to 
suffer fools gladly." From his sixteen years as a mayor, 
Lee seemed to be saying that public responsibility 
required just the right admixture of vice to a strong base 
of virtue. He seemed to be saying that a mayor had to be 
able to call an uncooperative developer or government 
official a "prick," as well as be able to address luncheon 
groups in the basement of a church. 
Lee summarized by describing Daley as a "benevolent 
despot," and acknowledged that he had been described 
that way himself while mayor of New Haven. He seemed 
to enjoy the memory, just as his physical appearance 
suggested that he seemed to enjoy his distance from it. 
Then the question period started and a woman in the 
front row brought up the·oak Street issue. She charged 
Lee with being responsible for the present New Haven 
housing shortage because of the extensive demolition 
during the early renewal years. Lee denied her charge 
absolutely. Since 1950, there had been a tremendous 
migration of low income individuals and families to the 
city. This had caused the housing shortage, together with 
the failure of the suburbs to absorb their share of low 
income housing. The housing units he had demolished 
were unfit for occupancy. They lacked heat, electricity, 
and in some caseS, even running water. His voice reached 
a pitch. He was moving again. His programs were being 
challenged. Out of some reflex action which he had no 
doubt developed from hours in federal offices and 
aldermanic caucuses, he let loose with all the emotion 
befitting the issue, " Those units were not fit for dogs, 
let alone people!" The audience, carried along with him. 
clapped their approval. 
Meanwhile, five blocks away, workmen were finally 
busy constructing Crown Court, the last phase of the 
Oak Street Redevelopment Plan. After years of delay 
because of grudgingly given federal mortgages, the eight 
story luxury apartment building was finally going up, on 
the same block as the luxurious Crown Towers and 
across the street from the luxurious Madison Towers. 
Whether these buildings and all the demolitions required 
to put them there will, in the final analysis, stand as a 
monument to Lee's callousness or to his vision remains 
to be seen. Maybe he will be better remembered for 
Church Street South. or for the nation's first Section 
221-d-3 housing, or for the inception of a business 
relocation plan for small businesses being dislocated by 
renewal. Regardless. these buildings and much of New 
Haven will stand as a monument to his energy_e

terference and, not unexpectedly, }$ departure was met 
with cries of anguish from the liberal community. The 
sophisticated and erudite gentility of the former chief 
made him a perfect political plum for the anti~uida 
Democratic alliance, as well as for the liberal-leaning, 
once-and-future mayoral candidate, Paul Capra. Many 
of the top officials in the Lee administration had already 
fled New Haven, but DeLieto was the major, high-proftle 
appointment of the new mayor. Guida had chosen to 
leave vacant the important positions of director of 
administration, development administrator, and city en-
gineer' and had been frustrated in attempts to appoint 
a party regular to the position of zoning director. Now 
he was making his move, and it would have to be a good 
one. The new chief would have to prove that he was 
every bit as intelligent, every bit as personable, every 
bit as liberal, and every bit as competent as the man he 
replaced. 
Hence, the rush for the headlines, or, as Commission-
er Munson put it, "visibility in the community." De-
Lieto was uncommonly well suited to the task, being 
possessed of a seemingly insatiable ego, and he paraded 
to openings and dinners and every ceremonial occasion 
imaginable. Every morning, his secretary would place 
a set of glossies from the previous day's events on his 
desk for the chiefs review. 
But with all the glory of actually being chief, 
DeLieto still labored under the image of Ahem. As he 
strode to the podium to deliver his review, he could 
only be adjudged second best in his competition with 
the image. Greeting Jerry Lewis as he stepped off a 
ftre truck and onto a bandstand on the Green was just 
not the same as marshalling the city's forces against the 
Panthers from the front line. There was also some linger-
ing embsrrassment, as well as lingering litigants, con-
cerning $450,000 of cocaine which turned out to be 
50 cents worth of quinine. Upper echelon police 
morale was at an all-time low, what with the chiefs 
absences to be visible in the community, and the 
department had recently lost two division ~rnmanders, 
Heaphy in training, and Talbot of planning and bud-
geting. Nevertheless, the chief would try it again. 
From behind his dark, wide-lapeled suit, red shirt with 
•·nth black-stone-set-in-gold cuff links, and wide silver, 
red, and black tie, DeLieto made a somewhat shallow ad-
mission of awe "in the presence of so much sophistica-
tion." He further confessed, and later proved to the sat-
isfaction of one and all, that he had never reviewed a 
book before. 
There can be no doubt that the book in question 
was a good one for DeLieto to cut his teeth on. Any 
police chief could have had a fteld day with Reiss' ex-
haustive and exhausting sorties into the never-never 
land of the sociologist. The Police and the Public is a 
collection of bela borings of the obvious and lamenta-
tions of the real, all held together by the author's 
unshakeable conviction that the utopian is best of all. 
One is hard put to disagree with the author's conviction, 
and is therefore quite disappointed to ftnd that the en-
tire piece is completed without the slightest hint as to 
how one might go about correcting the little flaws that 
nature has so cruelly inserted into the crystal of man. 
It would certainly be impossible to fmd any fault 
with the thoroughness of Reiss' basic researches, which 
spanned ftve years, took place in four major cities, and 
included patrol observations as well as detailed analyses 
of police ftle statistics. However, the average reader 
does not feel a genuine need for an eight page analysis to 
establish once and for all that most antagonism toward 
the police comes from people they are arresting, as 
opposed to people who call the police requesting that 
someone else be arrested. 
Reiss very thoroughly documents the problems the 
police have with the public and vice vena, many of 
which start out as the simple failure of the police to be 
civil to offenders and the failure of an officer to recog-
nize the legitimacy of policy authority. However, once 
this information is imparted to the reader, nothing 
further is done with it than to suggest that people have 
simply got to be more polite to each other. 
From the several typographical errors in the printed 
text and from the book's title, which is more journaJ.is... 
tic than academic, it is apparent that the ·publishers 
rushed some in their hope to capitalize on the public's 
concern for the state of law enforcement in America. 
They need not have bothered, for The Police and the 
Public has only a very limited value to the average citi-
zen. Although some interesting points are made about 
the evolution of a national police force and some shock-
ing statistics are developed concerning the extent of 
police corruption, the book's main utility lies in its pages 
of data tables, which, while not put to any immediate 
good use, may have some value for future scholars who 
are more inclined toward practice than statistical 
gymnastics. 
Unfortunately, Chief DeLieto missed all of this, 
choosing instead to descnoe the book as refreshingly 
readable, being neither "abstract or excessivelv legaJ.is... 
tic." Any reader of the book would immediately wonder 
how the endless pages of sociological jargon had 
eluded the chief, how sentences such as "A bureau-
cracy requires the standardization of rules by a central 
authority in the expectation that universalism will pre-
vail in the application of these rules," could have es-
caped his comment. The ansWer, as it turns out, resides 
in the fact that he had never read the book, and only 
recently had had the text of the review delivered to him 
by a staff aid. 
However, like the chief himself, and probably with 
every justification, the public had paid no attention to 
the book. As a result, the question and answer session 
followins the revic:w did not pursue the few issues 
raised in The Police and the Public, but featured citizen 
complaints about the scarcity of speed traps and the 
demise of the foot patrolman. These questions were 
ones with which the chief could deal handily enough and 
so he ftnished off the lunch hour, confidently Aherning 
in the name of community visJoility. Solemnly, the 
chief assured a female inquisitor, "The police officer 
is as near to you, madam, as your telephone." Enthus-
iastically, he bestowed the ultimate .compliment on a 
black member of the audience, "You are a very, very 
perceptive young man. This is an idea I have been trying 
to stress for years and years." He explained one of his 
favorite theories and qualified it with all due humility, 
"My appraisal at best involves intuition and empirical 
judgment." 
Shortly after 1 p.m., the question period ended. If 
anything, the review would have delighted Albert 
Reiss, both for being favorable to his book and for being 
such a civil encounter between the police and the public. 
However, upon leaving the basement of the United 
Church on the Green, one could not help but wonder 
where, between the ego and the image, books had in 
fact been sandwiched in. e
