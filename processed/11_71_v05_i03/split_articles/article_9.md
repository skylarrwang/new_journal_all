I sit down to write you a poem 
As the sounds of AK47 rifle fire pour into my brain, 
As the sounds of R 15 machine guns pin up my heart; 
But my hand doesn't shake. 
Only the words " I love" get slanted 
Because of mortars and cannons, artillery and tanks. 
Outside, they are fighting, for glory in battle: 
On this side one person slumps down, dead. 
On the other side one person still lives. 
There another groans and cries out. 
Here one person laughs loudly in victory. 
And it all starts over. 
Oh my love! 
More than twenty years 
And today it still goes on. 
I search my brain 
Looking for a small quiet place 
To remember for a moment my native village. 
But my love, 
That part of my brain 
Has been filled with smoke of bullets and bombs 
For too long. 
The fields, 
The bamboo hedges, 
Flowing rivers, 
The highlands with their little trees, 
The cities big and imposing, 
All battle grounds spread with blood. 
Each hand's breadth of land 
Has its corpse. 
Yet what glory have they won? 
They are dead, killed 
By a Communist's AK rifle 
Or by a nationalist's gun; 
By an ally's bullet 
Or by the shrapnel of a bomb. 
They slump and fall 
Without having known the enemy, 
Mesmerized by the big words: 
Peace, Freedom, Unification. 
This poem comes to you 
Whether my village lives or dies; 
The fire bums high. 
I stop here. 
Ple818, love, don't ask why. 
Some day when there's peace 
I will write you a different poem.


**Title: Black Flower**
**Author: null**

You sit in a car 
With a foreigner 
And wave your hand. 
Is it to say good-bye to me, 
Or farewell to days that have passed? 
11/The New Journal/November 28, 1971 
Your face reminds me of someone I have known; 
I search my mind, 
I try to remember who it might be 
Who has waved to me 
In bitterness or sympathy. 
My god! It is you 
Whom I love, whom I have spent happy days with; 
Innocent and small, 
With soft cheeks and full lips, 
With virgin skin unblemished, 
With a scent fine as the frailest flower; 
The one I worshipped and respected. 
And now all that is finished. 
I remember when you were a student not long ago, 
Holding your palm-leaf hat against the sun 
To shade your face, 
Pouting when the teacher gave you a low mark. 
Now you exchange your flesh for money, 
Dress up in powder and perfume. 
You are called Mrs. or Miss-
Does it matter? 
You are a bitter glass of whiskey 
Which people of a different color, different race 
Buy to satisfy themselves. 
And I, still just a man 
Who, morning and night, 
Drags his feet to the cafe we knew then 
Without money enough for two cups of coffee. 
I look at the people. 
I look at you there 
I look at everybody. 
And I bow my head to wipe tears from my eyes. 
I want to take the earth in my hands 
And squeeze it so tightly 
The meridians will be squashed out of shape 
And we, following our separate lines, 
Will never again meet under the great vault of heaven, 
Because a dream is always beautiful, 
Isn't it? 
Oh, but the sad truth is 
The day I really say good-bye to you; 
I will instruct the sun not to rise 
So I can hold you in my arms forever; 
I will not tremble with fear, 
No one will see me blush, 
And my shyness will be hidden.
