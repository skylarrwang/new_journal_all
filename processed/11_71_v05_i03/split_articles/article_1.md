There are niches in most Gothic buildings around Yale, in the Branford courtyard, in Sterling Library, the gym, the Law School, the entrance to J.Javenport, and so on, but most of the niches are empty. Only Harkness Tower has been filled completely, and that with statues so high up you have to crane your neck to find them, though they include such notables as Jonathan Edwards, Euclid, Homer, and James Fenimore Cooper (expelled from Yale in his junior year). 

Why has Yale foregone the opportunity to provide models of inspiration and righteousness for its students? We asked Wesley Needham, adviser in Tibetan literature for the university library and a fellow of Trumbull College. Needham, who now works for a furniture store in New Haven, learned firsthand about Gothic architecture as a draftsman for James Gamble Rogers (Yale's Louis Sullivan) in the 1920's. 

Mr. Needham explained that the niche, like the stained glass window, served an essential purpose in the ecclesiastical Gothic style of the Middle Ages. It was the shape of an arch, pointed to heaven, and it held a statue of an apostle, saint, or martyr. When the Reformation came, however, many of the religious statues were disposed of and the niches left empty. When Gothic architecture was adapted to collegiate purposes, such as at Oxford and Cambridge, some of the niches were filled with historical figures and scholars, but many remained unfilled. The niche became an embellishment without function, an art form all its own. 

-when James Gamble Rogers designed the Yale buildings," Needham said, "he used photographs of Oxford and elsewhere, not to copy but as guides so he wouldn't go astray. The Law School is an exception, but he wanted to develop the Gothic style as it would have developed on its own, if the Gothic tradition had remained unbroken." 

The empty niches did not pose a problem at first. "When the buildings were built," Needham said, indicating Saybrook, Branford, and Davenport in one broad sweep, "it wasn't a serious matter if the niches weren't filled. It could come later. Maybe they could get a donor to give some money." 

Later could be now. An impromptu survey shows that Yale students have varying ideas on whom to put in the niches. Some would like to see the great brains of this century, the Albert Einsteins and James Joyces. Others favor the great jocks of Yale history, notably Brian Dowling, Calvin Hill, and the mythical Frank Merriwell. (Payne Whitney Gym has plenty of niches.) But most have indicated a desire for American cultural heroes, from Davey Crockett to Mickey Mouse. The actress Diana Rigg scored high; did a lot of counter-culture figures like Jerry Garcia and Ken Kesey. 

Some would like to see Buckminster Fuller, facing east toward Science Hill. Others would like to have Jerry Rubin sitting down on his niche, rapping with the kids. Still others including William F. Buckley would like to see William F. Buckley or nothing at all. 

Perhaps a movement could be formed to fill the niches, to bring about the greening of Yale. Think about it. Decide whom you believe in, contact a sculptor, and then worship at the niche of your choice.
