EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
People have said a lot 
About the countryside 
In difficult and lofty phrases· 
With ‘feelings’ marked night 
Cryptic or bitter 
As the words of a lover betrayed. 
But I would like now to say some simple things, 
Simple as a field of rice or sweet potatoes, 
Or a silent early morning. 
Please let me breathe again 
The air of yesterday. 
Let children play in the sun 
With kites over bamboo bridges. 
Just a narrow little space will be enough, 
Four rows of bamboo trees surrounding; 
And leave a little space for an entrance, 
. A place for a girl and boy to tell the story of the moon, 
For old women with babies to gather and chatter. 
Please give me back these things I've mentioned: 
A story so simple 
As a bird's unbroken song, 
As a mother, 
As a baby, 
As the life of long ago the poets used to tell...


**Title: A Dream Which has Withered**
**Author: Hoentl Minh Nt.ng**

The day I grew up, 
Near my father. near my mother. 
Near my sister, near my brother. 
I only knew how to plant mulberry trees, 
And cultivate rice; 
And then one day war by chance came 
And trampled on my native village. 
People in the name of the father land, 
People in the name of man, 
People in the name of freedom, 
~eople in the name of happiness, 
Spy on each other. destroy each other. 
My father went up into the mountains, 
My mother waits and waits, 
My brother resists the war • 
My uncle is a nationalist; 
People teach me how to hate, 
People teach me how to kill, to cut off heads, 
All in the name ·of love, 
Of philanthropy. of compassion; 
Fathers, mothers, wives, children, whole villages 
Turn into strangers 
And become enemies. 
People teach me to bear grudges, to resent, 
But I only want to be a husband, 
A father. with a wife, with a young son 
Who knows how to say the two words: Viet Nam, 
From Cao Bang to the seas of Thailand. 
But my dream is a small trifle, 
Dim and uncertain, as the days pass.
