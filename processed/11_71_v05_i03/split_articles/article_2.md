Religious figures don't usually attract big crowds at Yale, but tonight the little rabbi with the yarmulke faces a crowd of 400 from where he stands at the Political Union's rostrum. A sizeable number of New Haven residents have joined students at the university to hear him speak. The citizens are middle-aged, respectable. By the end of the evening one of them will have risen to accuse the speaker of hypocrisy. Another will quote the Talmud to him and call him a murderer. 

The speaker is Rabbi Meir Kahane, leader and founder of the militant Jewish Defense League. In the past year he has spent more time in jail and has made more headlines than either Huey Newton or Jerry Rubin. And what does the rabbi talk about tonight? Jewish kids. 

"It is time for young Jews to open up a Jewish book. Philip Roth is not a Jewish book. The young Jew is raised not to be a true Jew, but to make the local caterer happy on his bar mitzvah." The students laugh. The adults smile uneasily. 

Rabbi Kahane addresses himself to the adults about their children, many of whom are gathered in front of him. He tells them that being a Jew loses its meaning when Jews do not fight for their rights. 

"To love a Jew means, for another Jew, feeling the pain of Israel as your own." He tells the audience about Silva Zalmanson, one of the Jews arrested in Russia for allegedly trying to hijack a plane. She is now in a Siberian jail where, he says, the temperature drops to 40 degrees below zero in the winter. "Any Jew who hears the cries of Silva Zalmanson and doesn't heed them is dead as a Jew. They will be as guilty as the Jews were 30 years ago," he says. 

The motto of the Jewish Defense League is "Never Again," referring to what Rabbi Kahane considers the shameful passivity of Jews during World War II. It is more than a motto for the rabbi. It is a creed, almost a religion in itself, based on a combination of ethnic guilt and ethnic pride. He harps on these two themes as he attempts to rebuild American Judaism. 

He mocks the "Uncle Jakes" who do not follow his militant lead because they are "obsessed by the need for respectability." He sneers at the Jews who were unable to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to bomb the rail lines to Auschwitz or allow Jewish refugees to immigrate to the United States during the war. "We couldn't get 200 Jews to go down to Washington and chain themselves to the White House gates," he says disparagingly. He warns that, "with a few exceptions, a Jew's only ally is another Jew," and he blasts those who will not fling themselves into the battle. 

"I have stood at the Soviet embassy for two years, waiting for the people we marched with in Selma, in Washington, at the peace rallies, to join us. When it's a Jewish problem, who marches? Jews. So," he warns, "we come to the question of violence." He goes to the Bible and the Talmud, and continued on page 13
