College Street on November 6 
looks like a pep rally for a charity 
ball. Clusters of women and teenage 
girls and an occasional couple crowd 
the sidewalk. Everyone is sober and 
proud, waiting for Rod McKuen to 
appear at the Shubert. 
You can recognize Rod McKuen 
from his poetry, "Acne scars/Tired 
eyes/Wrinkles on my forehead," or by 
the famous brittle blond hair, or the 
ubiquitous black sneakers. He re-
sembles nothing less than a poet who 
moonlights as a hairdresser. Even in 
the flesh he's a black and white snap-
shot in a color set. Rod McKuen's sex 
appeal is a tribute to America, to the 
democratic principle which says that 
any boy can, and to the will of the 
majority which insists that millions of 
housewives can't be wrong. 
Rod stands silently while his en-
tourage busily chooses between two 
dressing rooms. Rod never talks 
to anyone before his concerts. His 
people show none of his reticence. 
They turn the Shubert theater lobby 
into a Congress of Commerce and 
Art. "Take a bit of Rod McKuen home 
with you. Try him in your own living 
room." But for their poetic sensibilit-
ies, these lady hawkers might have 
gone far in Shea Stadium. "Get your 
limited British editions. Rod in song 
and story." 
Inside, the superficially young 
crowd soon reveals its in.nate middle 
age. Although there are only two men 
in the front row, there are consider-
ably more further back. All wear 
their hair liberally curled on the neck, 
or, if fortunate, lanky. but always a 
cut above the collar like Rod's. Most 
of the women would pass meeting 
house muster. They wear expressions 
of studied sensitivity. They have come 
for Art. 
The curtain flnally rises and the 
stage looks as shabby as it had from 
the wings, disproving all those cliches 
about the magic of the footlights. Thin 
volumes of poetry are neatly strewn 
on stools which are asymmetrically 
aligned. It has the lived-in look of 
home and folks. Rod walks on to 
polite enthusiasm, assumes his stance, 
and immediately begins to sing. He 
looks like a flgure study of Resolu-
tion: feet apart, head forward, arms at 
his sides except in the swell of a key 
emotion. Obviously, this is not his 
medium; he is a poet, a bard, a loner. 
But he is here for us, Art confront-
ing Culture in the name of Truth. 
Rod wears a white sweater which 
blends into his neck and dark slacks 
which blend into the musicians. Even 
the spotlight can't follow him, and 
the poor JUY is sober. Only the heavy 
treaded sneakers seem alive. Rod is 
both with us and apart, casual and 
ready to bolt. To this audience, un-
able to fit into Ken Kesey's movie 
and Captain America's speed bike, 
Rod is the myth, the drifter, the 
catcher of trains. 
He reads about flnding twenty 
dollars. He bought a fountain pen and 
a jackknife because he'd never owned 
one. "He was rich in those days," 
goes the poem. This poetry operates 
on several levels. The audience 
realizes that this experience is deeper 
than mere words. Many of them can't 
hear at all, but they are absorbing the 
thoughts, the vibrations. Discontent is 
politely stared into silence like cough-
ing at a final exam. At one point Rod 
describes his poetry as both a diary 
and the cure for a bad cold. He is 
only joking, of course. 
In format, the concert, like the 
stage, is designed to display Rod 
through his art.

. Modesty: Rod humbly acknowledges 
his debts especially to those artists 
who have recorded his songs: Mary 
Trjivers, Petula Clark, and Perry Como. 
Bluntness: To those critics who 
accuse him of sentimentality, Rod 
answers "tough," and he's not 
bluff'mg. "Get up and hit 'em in the 
uead with love." 
Xffection: Rod celebrates the father-
hood of his sheep dog, Mr. Kelly, 
with considerable skill in whistling. 
Ambition: Having studied various 
brand name detergents (Biz, Duz, Top 
Job, Cold Power, Joy), Rod has come 
up with the soap the housewife really 
wants: Climax. 
Creativity: He introduces the illus-
trated Rod McKuen calendar contain-
ing 365 holidays and a month of Sun-
days. Typical holidays celebrate the 
fourth birthday of Rosemary's 
baby or King Kong's ten-inch teeth . . 
Art is not astronomy. 
Concern: Rod leads a audience par-
ticipation chorus of "Soldiers who 
want to be heroes/Number practically 
zero/But there are millions who want 
to be civilians." 
Sincerity: "Remember it doesn't mat-
ter who you love or how you love, 
*t that you love." 
Rod delivers this material earnestly 
and carefully. What emerges, however,. 
is a true Brechtian spectacular. Every 
stage direction is clearly delineated. 
From his every gesture we know that 
Rod has been told to move or stand 
"just so." But why? Why would 
"America's fastest selling poet" stoop 
to parody at the hands of promoters? 
Is this worth all his evident discom-
fort? But most of all who is he try-
ing to be? Lenny Bruce? Charles 
Schultz? George Fenneman? Maybe 
next fall when he brings us his "one-
man show" ... 
Rod doesn't have time for auto-
graphs tonight, but no one's being 
sent away until Rod's aide f'mds the 
girls he's looking for. He is about 25, 
tall, lean, with Rod McKuen blond 
hair that is dry but not yet brittle, 
and he is asking everyone's name. I 
watch the drama of hope and rejecr 
tion until I am ushered into a small 
cubicle, the Shubert's luxury dressing 
room, and am confronted with Rod 
McKuen's soulful eyes. 
Rod rarely grants interviews now-
adays. Maybe two or three a year, 
although he reads about 60. He has 
never read or seen "Love Story," 
Buy your beloved a 
Wt 
mfrl 
a ···erao. o ·: 
.·. Bed 
.. · . . 
although he "would like to." Perhaps 
that's just as well, however, as there 
is a basic conflict. Rod thinks "Love 
means continually having to say you're 
sorry." In fact, he doesn't under-
stand why they've been linked together 
so often. 
Faced with inf'mite possibility I opt 
for the mundane. "Didn't you say 
that you'd 'paved the way for Erich 
Segal?'" (Esquire, January 1971) 
"I'm quoted as saying that? No. 
Yes? I couldn't have said that." Rod 
does feel that there's a need for roman-
ticism, however. "The times are 
so brittle." 
Rod doesn't have time for novels. 
He reads nine newspapers and at 
least 30 journals, because he's "con-
cerned with what's happening now." He 
writes to "clarify his own life" 
and in hopes that this may "clarify the 
lives of others. Today there is a need 
for people to be honest with each 
other. Children especially need to be 
taught this." Is he pleased that many 
high schools are teaching his poetry 
along with Love Story? "Well, I 
wouldn't presume to teach." 
We are interrupted by the aide 
triumphantly leading in sqmebody's 
"cousins." He starts to break camp. 
Tyco 
15/The New Journal/November 28, 1971 
"What about your fllm?" I shout 
at Rod. 
The script is f'mished and cast. It 
is necessarily somewhat autobio-
graphical, as it is based on the early 
poetry. He can't relate it to Love 
Story because he's "never seen it." 
Rod is played by a 23-24 year old 
unknown whose identity is a 
mystery. 
"How about the woman?" 
"Jean Simmons." 
"Jean Simmons! But doesn't she 
represent a certain style, say the 
Romantic Epic?" 
Rod doesn't want to give any more 
away. And. after all maybe he just 
likes her name. •

Oh, My! Eli Screws up 
Georgeously 
Dear Adler, 
Well at least you were consistent, 
and consistency is the whole thing, 
huh? But the guy's name is Chile 
Allam, not Chilly Allan. And, al-
though you may not know how he 
got it, we all do. 
Let's get on the goddam ball.
