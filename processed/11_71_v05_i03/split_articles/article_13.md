A good word, a bright idea. They're better when you 
tell someone. And if you can't get together over a beer 
or a cup of coffee, then get on the phone and call. 
If your friend's in California, low long distance rates 
from 5 to 11 p.m. weeknights let you telephone clear 
across the country for 85¢ plus tax, for three minutes, 
when you dial without operator assistance. It's only 
70¢ Saturdays and up to 5 p.m. Sundays. 
The telephone can help to bring you together, and 
that's what sharing is all about. Right? Right.
