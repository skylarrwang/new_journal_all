Women of the South 
Tran thi Ly* 
Long hair, hair of a young mother, 
Washed in the water of Thu Bon, 
Adorning your body, wounded in a hundred places. 
In life and death, always loyal. 
Muoi Dong Thap 
Just turned twenty, 
Leader of three hundred struggles. 
One leg left, you stand erect, 
A beautiful flag wrapping your body. 
Nguyen thi Ut 
A guerrilla of the Delta 
Carrying your only child on your hip, 
Combing the river bank, 
... "' ,, 
.,.. 
Striking the enemy as naturally as you go to market. 
Ta thi Kieu 
With a beautiful name from ancient times, 
You're a faithful niece of Uncle Ho. 
Striking the enemy, you're strong as a tiger. 
Speaking of it, you smile like a flower. 
Nguyen thi Dinh 
In the assault you command a hundred squads. 
Night returns, you sit mending fighters' clothes. 
Woman general of the South, descending from Trao and Nhi, •• 
You've shaken the brass and steel of the White House. 
By Luu Trong Lu 
1966 
Tran thi Ly is a woman's name as are the other 
headings of this poem. 
Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, the famous Trung sisters 
who led Vietnamese against the Chinese about 40 B.C.

Don Luce returned to the United 
States after tvvelve years in VietNam, 
when the Saigon government re-
ftned to renew his visa because 
of his artic/1 on the Con Son prison 
tiger cages.

he fmds that sometimes violence has 
to be the Jewish way. "Moses beheld 
an Egyptian smiting a Jew and did he 
form a committee? No, he smote the 
Egyptian." 
Rabbi Kahane is an internationalist 
who sees the United States as the only 
bulwark against tyranny. He genuinely 
fears the new isolationism. ''There is 
a community of interest between Jews 
all over the world and this country." 
He compares the American efforts at 
detente with the Soviet Union to 
Neville Chamberlain's actions at 
Munich. "He thought he'd earned 
peace by canceling out a few Czechs," 
Rabbi Kahane says. 
''This nation stands between free.. 
dom and the long knife of tyranny," 
he says. Many adults applaud lustily, 
but their applause is drowned in a 
torrent of hisses from the majority of 
the students. 
But Rabbi Kahane starts entertain-
ing again, and the hisses are forgotten. 
"Many Jews tell me they like my 
aims, but not my tactics. I was on a 
television talk show with Abbie Hoff-
man a while ago. After we had talked 
for a while Abbie toked at me and 
said, 'I love your tactics, but I don't 
like your aims.' How can you dislike 
a guy like Abbie?" he asks, adopting 
a trace of Yiddish dialect. "I went out 
and stole his book." 
Rabbi Kahane concludes with an 
appeal to all Jews to defend their 
own interests. ''To let yourself be 
stepped on is not the Jewish way." 
The students applaud the performance 
lustily. Many of the adults await the 
question and answer period. The ques-
tions are generally abstract discussions 
of the merits of violence, with the 
adults asking most of the tougher 
questions. The man who calls the rabbi 
a murderer does not specify to what 
he is referring. The rabbi does not 
dignify the charge with a response ex-
cept to say that discussion of such a 
charge is impossible. 
Mterwards, the students file out 
the front entrance back to the library 
or to their rooms. One student re-
marks, "Kahane, along with Hoffman 
and Jerry Rubin, is probably the last 
of the great Jewish comics." 
At the other end of the room, New 
Haven residents use another exit to 
get to the ttreet. One bulky man 
stands and scowls at the podium where 
the rabbi is talking with some stu-
dents. The man seems to be about to 
yell something, but, remembering his 
respectability, he merely turns angrily 
and walks away. contirwed on page 15
