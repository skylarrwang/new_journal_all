throu!ll and the reality of chaos assumes 
its ri!lltful place. This tum of events 
does not happen, because certain truths 
are never tolerated publicly, neither by 
individuals nor by cultures. Archetypes 
save such a society from collective mad· 
ness, archetypes derived from institu· 
tions with historical pretentions: govern· 
ments, churches and families. Colonial 
)!individuals may not know who they are, 
but they certainly know what they are. 
But no system is free of surds, 
erratics. These are real individuals who 
by chance are granted immunity from 
the destiny of those around them. The 
immunity is also a burden: self· 
consciousness, the awareness of differ· 
ences between oneself and those around 
him, the awareness of the unreality of 
everyday life. Yet this self-aware individual 
must derive a sense of reality from some· 
where, and if this sense cannot be found 
in local circumstances, then it must be 
found elsewhere, a physical or aesthetic 
elsewhere. 

This is the subject of Betrayed by 
Rita Hayworth : the appearance of a 
self-aware individual in rural Argentina, 
a character born In an ahlstorical setting, 
in a context of social archetypes, a 
character who derives his sense of 
reality from films. Manuel Puig, the 
author, is '!itally concerned with 
history, with the phenomenon of time, 
bt.it he does not deal with this material 
in dialetical terms. He is not interested 
in recreating history, as for instance a 
novelist would be, by creating charac· 
ters whose lives reproduce the dialec-
tical factors of the era in which he sets 
the book. Rather, he reproduces the 
results of a situation (not really a 
historical situation, but an archetypal 
one) : its people. The characters here 
are not charged with historical signifi· 
cance, but with psychological and 
archetypal energy. That is, people are 
not created as representatives of a class, 
and the work does not derive its 
structure from the interplay of these 
classes. We get the feeling that there is 
no community here (because there is 
no history), that this is in fact the 
work's overriding moral comment. 

But once that primary associat ion is 
understood, there seems to be no imper-
ative in Puig's aesthetic to enlarge upon 
it. Social conflict as such is therefore 
virtually absent from Betrayed by Rita 
Hayworth, displaced by internal, 
psychological realities, wnich sometimes 
fmd expression in social reality. It is this 
fragmentary social structure which gives 
the book its Shape: it is composed of 
isolated, unrelated chapters in which the 
characters think, converse, write, or are 
described. Puig arranges the chapters in 
chronological order, ironically repro-
ducing the flow of time as it occurs in 
the world the text imitates, with one 
exception. 

When we reach the last chapter of 
the book, we suddenly find that we are 
again at the beginning. Chapter XVI, 
" Berto's letter, 1933," is in the wrong 
place. It should appear as an interpola· 
tion in Chapter II, " At Berto's place, 
Vallejos, 1933." This dislocated chap-
ter, a signal to the reader that the 
book's reality is somehow outside of 
chronological time, may be understood 
as an episode not essential to the plot; 
part, perhaps, of the plot's prehistory, 
or as one of the events which do in fact 
push the action to its conclusion. And 
yet, if we examine the information 
contained in the chapter, we see that 
althou!ll it does give us information 
about the characters, it has nothing to 
do (except as a distant, indirect cause) 
with any dramatic action. The meaning 
of Betrayed by Rita Hayworth does not 
depend on our biographical knowledge 
of its characters; it is not therefore a 
novel and not bound to the cause and 
effect relationships implicit in any plot. 

Novels are permanently wedded to 
plot and history. When an author 
abandons these, his art becomes some-
thing else: romance, satire, anatomy. 
Puig is clearly writing about a world 
which cannot be novelistically repro-
duced. If we accept the idea that it is 
the fate of any writer to express his age, 
that it is moreover the onerous task of 
the novelist to bear the weight of his-
tory, then we may certainly accept the 
concept of an author writing some-
thing other than a novel when he has no 
history to reproduce. Puig, despite 
the contemporaneity of his setting, is 
chronicling a myth. The myth is modest: 
not the birth of Orpheus, not Prome-
theus giving fire to men, but the ap-
pearance of self-awareness. This myth 
may seem I ike just another archetypal 
role repeating itself, and yet it would 
seem that it is this self-conscious in-
dividual who lends dignity to those who 
lack his awareness. 

The aesthetic center of gravity of 
Betrayed by Rita Hayworth is a boy, 
Toto, who dominates only three of the 
book's sixteen chapters. That he is not 
the rrotagonist of the work is a tunc· 
tion of the sort of book it is. It has no 
real plot, and it attempts to recreate no 
historical period; rather it traces the 
early manifestations of self-awareness. 
But what we learn about Toto in these 
three chapters clearly points out his sig-
nificance: he is intelligen~, he has under-
standing and intuition, and he is sex-
ually ambiguous. This last detail is im-
portant in that it isolates the boy, sep· 
arating him from the blind copying of 
patterns revealed to him by his father, 
his cousin, and his masculine friends. 

Toto's reaction to all situations, 
particularly unpleasant ones (being 
rebuffed by a girl, feeling cheated when 
his father does not bring him to a 
cafe after a movie, being attracted to 
the uncle of the girl who treated him 
badly), is to create a metaphorical 
rationalization for the event. The stage 
for this primitive form of artistic cre-
ation is the movies. They are reality; 
therefore particularly strong social 
situations are analogous to them. For 
example, in Chapter V, "Toto, 1942", 
we see a systematic restatement of Toto's 
relationship with his father - his most 
serious competitor for his mother's 
love. To explain, in veiled terms, what 
he is experiencing, Toto allegorizes 
the film Blood and Sand (starring Rita 
Hayworth and Tyrone Power). 

For Toto, Blood and Sand is a lesson 
about evil triumphing over good, about 
the death of innocence. He says about 
Rita Hayworth, "And sometimes she 
looks wicked, she's a pretty actress but 
she's always betraying somebody." 
later he adds: "But In Blood and Sand
she betrays the good boy." The "good 
boy" is Tyrone Power, but he is also 
Toto. In Chapter II I, he describes him· 
self in that way when he takes part in 
a dream version of a Shirley Temple 
film. Here he is Rita Hayworth's vic· 
tim, but his simple appropriation of 
Tyrone Power's part implies that she 
too has been recast. As the chapter 
goes on, we see that Rita Hayworth has 
become Toto's father, who had "be· 
trayed" him by inviting some· friends 
to the house instead of going to a cafe 
with Toto and his mother. 

Toto is perpetually betrayed by his 
father, because he cannot be his father. 
His father is all of the oppressors in all 
of the films Toto sees. In The Great 
Ziegfeld, Toto takes on the role of a 
bellboy whose stepfather mistreats him. 
Here he metaphorically displaces his 
father by creating an alternate family, 
with a mother he helps and a father 
he loves. His own father is his cruel 
stepfather. In The Great Waltz, the 
subject of one of Toto's school com-
positions, he becomes an artist (Johann 
Strauss), a victim who when he loses 
his mistress laments that "he never 
succeeded in making her fall madly 
in love with him ... " Toto wants to be 
in dreams what he cannot be in life: 
loved without reservation, loved so 
madly that he can victimize his lover. 
He fails in his dream, just as he fails 
in life. 

Toto can never be free of his rela· 
tionship with his father, his Oedipal 
heritage. But his awareness of his lack, 
his unconscious need to fill that space 
through metaphorical activity will ul-
timately be one more step in his 
separation from his social setting. The 
success of this activity depends on fac-
tors which have nothing to do with his 
family. They occur in the reality of 
films, films metamorphosed in dreams 
and mixed with catechism lessons (par-
ticularly the Last Judgment, which stim-
ulates in Toto a grand fantasy in which 
he becomes a displaced version of his 
father by crawling inside the body of a 
man he wishes his father would copy in 
dress and grooming). 

The other characters in Betrayed by 
Rita Hayworth lack Toto's individuality; 
they are the normal inhabitants of Cor-
onel Vallejos, the small town where 
the work is set. They are two-dimen· 
sional figures, either possible versions 
of Toto (an adolescent who seeks 
sexual release, whose undifferentiated 
sexuality is instinctive, without aes· 
thetic transcendence; an old-maid piano 
teacher whose talent· has dried up in 
pedagogy), or figures who typify a 
class mentality (the character Esther, a 
fanaticql peronista whose displaced 
Oedipal energy is funnelled into pol-
itics). But the characters who stand 
as counterparts or alternatives to Toto 
do not have his self-consciousness, his 
intense dream life, in itself a sort of artis-
tic activity, while the others conform 
to certain archetypal structures, the 
kind at work in Puig's second, un~ 
translated book, Boquitas pintadas. 

Boquitas (Little Painted Mouths) 
is a second trip to Coronel Vallejos, 
but this time Puig studi~s the entire 
situation as if it were a serial romance 
novel or a soap opera. Here his con-
cept of history seems more apparent. 
There is no history in this world, there 
is not even a character like Toto who 
might conceivably represent a kind of 
aesthetic consolation to a people de· 
prived of historical reality. In Boquitas 
we find only archetypes, characters 
who reenact social roles without de· · 
viating from them. Like the figures 
in soap operas, they are not three-di· 
mensional because they have no real 
identity. They merely embody a cer-
tain cluster of emotions. Puig attempts 
to give historical significance to these 
cardboard figures by arranging them in 
family groups, the family representing 
~the organization of time in generations. 
But this dissimulation (which Puig car· 
ries over from soap operas) is quite· 
transparent because there is no real 
progress in the work. Just as in Be-
trayed by Rita Hawworth, chrono· 
logical sequence is an irony, a joke 
which underlines the eternal present 
operative in a society which exists in 
perpetual flux, where there is no 
dialectical tension between social 
elements, just the incessant reiteration of 
the same interplay of passions. 

Boquitas is the more hermetic of 
the two texts, and the least acces-
sible to non-Argentine readers. Be-
trayed by Rita Hayworth, with its 
succession of "close-ups" reminis-
cent of Under Milkwood or Eyeless 
in Gaza at least bears some resem-
blance to familiar literary structures. 
Boquitas, on the other hand, is onl\4 
comparable in structure to film: it 
utilizes flashbacks, documentary-
style objectivity, "pan" shots (the 
narrator describes a character's bed-
room, then "moves" out through a 
window to depict an action going on 
in a neighboring lot, and a narrative 
technique which utterly reifies the 
characters. It is the narrator's total 
detachment whi<;h supports his 
presentation of characters doomed 
to a kind of human underdevelop-
ment. This text and Betrayed by Rita 
Hayworth together form a kind of 
whole, a reduction of the false face 
of colonial history to its true 
components: an endless succession 
of moments without meaning. They 
form an exhaustive vision, one which 
Puig will clearly have to abandon for 
some time. His latest, still unfinished 
text is in fact about life in Buenos 
Aires, not unnaturally a mystery 
novel, the quintessential romance 
structure. 

Puig himself is something of an 
anomaly in Argentina and, in fact, in 
all ot Latin American literature. He 
seems to have disconnected himself 
quite consciously from all extant liter-
ary patterns. He does not imitate 
Borges, Cortazar or Garcia Marquez. 
And yet he is the result of the 
upsurge in the "new" Latin Amer-
ican literature, born some say in 1941, 
with Borges' volume The Garden of 
Forking Paths. This literature has 
always been conscious of its meta-
physica·l content, always divorced 
from direct subservience to any 
ideology, always extremely self-
conscious about style and form. Puig 
stands alone in this context because 
of his having broken with a specifi-
cally literary mode of literary produc-
tion. He does not use literature to 
make literature as Borges does; he is 
not trying to harmonize himself with 
his own vision of literary tradition as 
is Cortazar; and he has not set out to 
write the mock-epic of Spanish 
America, as Garcia Marquez has. He 
is unique in this hemisphere. 

Luckily, he has been well trans-
lated - unlike many of his latin 
American contemporaries. Suzanne 
Jill Levine, a New Haven resident, 
working closely with Puig (perhaps 
the best way to translate one reality 
into another) has •produced a 
genuinely interesting re-creation, 
which can stand on its own merit as 
a work of art. •
