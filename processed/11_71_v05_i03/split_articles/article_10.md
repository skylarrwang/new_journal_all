**Title: Invasion**
**Author: Huy Vu**
**Page number(s): 12**

As a child 
I was curious 
And asked my mother over and over 
"Why are the French called invaders?" 
With tears in her eyes she answered, 
" Have you not seen their tread upon our villages 
And the cannons, the airplanes?" 
And angered she would say 
"They are not Vietnamese." 
I nodded but didn't understand 
For others said the French 
Had come to help. 
" Why have Mr. Hai and Mr. Ba grown rich 
With the French? 
Why do you call them invaders, my mother?" 
And sadly she answered 
"Wait, grow up, you'll understand." 
Oh, why did you cry Mother? Why, Mother?' 
She is dead now. 
And the French have all gone. 
Still I see my mother crying, 
Tears rolling down the curve of her face, 
Today. Is it today? or years ago? 
For I am grown 
And my nephews ask the same old question. 
"What is an invasion?" 
I want to cry, but only say 
" You'll know when you grow up." 
But they understand much younger now. 
Not like when I was a boy. 
And they ask their uncle 
Harder questions. 
â€¢ 
"Where can we find our country?" 
We know now, we all know now 
What an invasion is, 
But where can we find our country?


**Title: Dead Bodies**

The following poem appeared in Lap 
Truong (Standpoint) in 1964. This 
newspaper was closed because of 
the anti-war nature of this poem. 
Dead bodies are all over the land, 
The faces unidentifiable, 
Without clothing, 
Lying on the same land 
Of poverty and hardship. 
An old mother with her stick, 
Tearful eyes, questioned 
The Nationalist, 
The Communist, 
Who live in the same village, 
Who belong to the same mother, 
Who have the same black hair and red blood, 
The same flat nose and yellow skin. 
In her burnt garden, 
This selection, prepared by the Com-
mittee of Concerned Asian Scholan 
for The New Journal comes from 
a forthcoming volume of Vietnamese 
poems, We Promise One Another, 
edited by Don Luce, John Schafer 
and Jacqueline Shagnon.


**Title: Letter To My Father**
**Author: Van Doan Hoc Sin**

During the years of hunger and degradation 
Tears wet my father's face. 
"What can we do, child? 
Stop crying, don't break our hearts." 
In the burning sun 
. My father sold his labor 
To get our bowl of rice; 
In the icy mornings 
My mother worked as a servant. 
Clothing and food were heavy chains, 
My children! 
We have struggled in life 
To overcome injustice and fraud, 
To raise you. 
You shall bear the world on your shoulders 
Love, justice, and truth 
Look ahead and make our dreams come true 
The dreams your father, your mother, and your suffering people 
Dreamt in pearling sweat. 
The year I was born 
My brothers in their twenties 
Were singing in excitement, 
Taking steps to break the bonds of degradation. 
Today, my father, your dream has come true. 
I, your courageous son 
Walk under the flag. 
Since my days of birth 
I have felt pains and sores 
Made by the iron of foreign boots. 
I have chosen justice 
As my source of life. 
I have learnt hatred when fire was destroying my country. 
The blade of my sword shines under the moon. 
My heart hangs high on the mountains. 
In excitement I follow the call toward the flag.

**Title: Saigon**

The children dug for burnt potatoes like hungry dogs. 
The Mother's eyes cannot see the future. 
The vultures came over the dead bodies. 
Animals and men are the same.
