Rita Hayworth can make time without history. 
Cin,ma verit,, documentaries, 
fragments of a certain moment: History. 
The raw material is time: wars, floods, 
rock festivals; the camera consecrates 
these ephemeral phenomena, invests 
them with an unnamed significance and 
thus preserves them. History, however, 
is intention, the dramatization of time, 
a shaping of phenomena to show causes 
and effects. History is not tirqe: time is 
meaningless, history is meaning. 
But where is there no history, only 
time? Lewis and Clark found time, 
pure flux, when they found the North 
American plains Indians. Children live 
in time. So do those peoples who are 
obliged to be the extras in someone 
else's history, the so<alled colonial 
nations. For these people, history 
always seems to be occurring some-
where else; the great dramas of world 
events are always somebody else's 
dramas in which they are always the 
audience; they are always "behind 
the times." 
To live in such a culture is to live in a 
social structure which perpetuates itself 
through repetition. The flow of time 
must be dissimulated, repressed, or the 
utter madness of the situation pokes

At the heart of the Marx Brothers' 
f'J.lm comedy was stage comedy, and at 
the heart of their stage comedy was 
vaudeville. Irving Thalberg, boy genius 
of MGM, intuitively sensed this when he 
began producing the Marx Brothers at 
Metro. The five pictures they had done 
for Paramount had become progressively 
thinner and thinner, and Thalberg knew 
that if the totally anarchic comedy of 
the Marx Brothers were not to wear out 
completely, their comic energy would 
need to be framed in a more or less 
cogent story line. For the explosion to 
have effect, there was need of an object 
susceptible to sabotage. 
The obvious source for this sort of 
screenplay was not in Hollywood but in 
New York.. Thalberg reached across the 
continent to the Algonquin and 
emerged with GeorgeS. Kaufman and 
Morrie Ryskind, authors of the Marx 
Brothers' early Broadway and flf1t film 
success, The Cocoanuts. With the aid of 
Al Boasberg. a gag specialist, these New 
York wits sat down in the hot California 
sun and sweated out the tcreenplay for 
A Night at the Opera. The script was 
good, and Thalberg enthusiastically met 
with Groucho to discuss the shooting. 
Groucho was pleased, but not confident. 
Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers had 
been hits, he maintained, because they 
had weathered years of live audiences 
before they ever made it to the screen. 
Who knew whether A Night at the 
Opera would work? 
Thalberg's solution to the problem 
was obvious, yet inspired. He suggested 
that the Marx Brothers put together 
fJVe of the big scenes from the screen-
play into a vaudeville show and go out 
on the road to test the material. The 
show opened in Seattle and flopped. 
During six weeks of touring, however, 
the scenes were revised, distilled, and 
injected with new material. Ryskind 
and Boasberg att:mded each perfor-
mance, noting .vhat had worked and 
what had not, and then rewrote to 
-accommodate the audiences' responses. 
By the time the tour closed at the 
Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco, 
it was a hit. Thalberg knew that they 
had a movie on their hands. 
Lonnie Carter's The Big House, 
currently at The Yale Repertory 
Theater, has something to do with 
the Marx Brothers and something 
to do with the movies. In the program 
for the production, Michael Feingold, 
literary manager for the company, 
states that, "Lonnie Carter's prison 
farce is an attempt to recall for 
contemporary audiences the tone 
and spirit, though not the factual 
details, of the Marx Brothers comedies, 
and the flowering of American comedy 
in the 1920s and '30s generally, filtered 
through his own distinctive use of 
verbal play ... The poster for The Big 
HOUS#! is a photographic collage of the 
Marx Brothers, Cbadie Chaplin, Buster 
Keaton, and Laurel and Hardy. 
The distinction between "tone and 
spirit" and "factual details .. of the 
Marx Brothers' comedies remains 
unclear to me. Surely we do not expect 
to hear the same lines as we have heard 
in the Marx Brothers' movies; after all, 
this is a new play. Nor do we expect to 
see Groucho. Chico, and Harpo, in the
