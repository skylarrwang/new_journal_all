EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"800 million dollars!" as Wolfe interjects-he 
owes in debts, for which Croker can't even 
begin to pay the inter,est. As a result, Charlie is 
$200 million in the 'fed, making a seizure of 
his many airplanes, cars, houses and horses 
likely. And his reputation is at stake in 
Adanta, where "they liked to talk about fami-
ly, but money was what it all came down to at 
the end of the day." To satisfy the consultants 
at PlannersBanc who keep harassing him for 
money, Charlie decides to lay off some work-
ers from his food packaging operation and 
search for other means to pay back his debts. 
Meanwhile, two other plots begin to 
unfold. Roger White II, a successful, educat-
ed, black corporate lawyer who can't seem to 
shake his old Morehouse nickname, Roger 
Too White, has been asked to work on a case 
that may upset the city's fragile racial balance. 
Fareek Fanon, Georgia Tech's All-American 
running back and 225 pounds of attitude, has 
been accused of raping Elizabeth Armholster, 
whose f.unily is "one of the first five names 
you'd think of if the subject was the White 
Establishment in Atlanta." Across the country 
in Oakland, a young laborer named Conrad 
Hensley has been laid off from one of Croker's 
frozen food packaging plants. The two sub-
plots begin to merge with Charlie at the cen-
ter of the story. Evenrually, Charlie is present-
ed with a Faustian bargain by Roger Too 
White, Atlanta's black mayor, and the Georgia 
Tech board: sell out the Armholster family 
(old friends he has sworn to help) and have 
his debts all but forgiven, or maintain his 
honor and potentially lose everything else. 
Throughout the sprawling narrative, 
Atlanta's invisible but palpable presence is 
constandy in the background. After 11 years 
of research, Wolfe has captured the many 
nuances of the city "too busy to hate" perfect-
ly-right down to the deep cigarette-induced 
baritones of Adanta's society women-even if 
it is a distinctly Northerner's perception. One 
racial tension after another is explored in A 
Man in Fu}/, the mistruSt of a city 75 percent 
black, yet still dominated by white business; 
the ironies of a city government where blacks 
question who is truer to the race; and even the 
different perceptions of rich and poor whites, 
viewing each other as if they were all but dif-
ferent colors themselves. 


But unlike most of Wolfe's other books, 
race is not the theme of this novel. A Man in 
F.Jl explores the different ways that America, 
NOVEMBER 30, 1998 
regardless of race, class, or gender, is coming 
to terms with the confusion of the 1990s and 
the approaching millenium, of a world chang-
ing too fast As the Wiz, Charlie's Wharton-
educated CFO explains, "the paradigm has 
shifted." Conrad, for one, lives in a plastic 
suburb described as "one goulash of condo-
miniums," where one community can only be 
Â· distinguished from another by the reappear-
ance of ?-Elevens and Wendy's franchises. 
Martha Croker, Charlie's ex-wife, finds herself 
single again and suddenly out of step with the 
flow of things. Charlie himself, while listening 
to a pseudo-postmodern critic discussing Fou-
cault and subjectivity in a piece of homoerotic 
art, feels 
A sudden stab of doubt ... Was it he, 
Charlie, who was out of step? Had his eyes 
been closed when some irresistible shift took 
place on the moral terrain? Or were all these 
people ... just plain intimidated, afraid to let it 
be known that they weren't sophisticated 
enough to be cosmopolites of the new 
Adanta, the international city? 


Wolfe has finally developed the talent to 
look beyond external appearances, and mak~ 
his characters three-dimensional. The egalitar-
ian sense of suffering that A Man in Full por-
trays, as each character builds his casde in the 
sky and watches it crumble, is Wolfe's silent 
assertion that America's realities, worries and 
doubts essentially plague everyone, once their 
immediate differences are swept away. 


Still, A Man in Full is not without its own 
problems. Wolfe hasn't learned how to end a 
novel. Simply put, Wolfe seems to have run 
out of time-at 68, this will probably be his 
last book. He drops the ending on the reader 
with none of the build-up and ornamentation 
of the powerful, informed writing of the first 
600 pages. 


A Man in Full may not have perfectly cap-
tured an entire nation's hopes and doubts, but 
it comes as close as any attempt seen so far in 
the 1990s. And who knows what Tom Wolfe 
has left up his sleeve? The last page of the 
book offers hope for another commentary in 
the future: "'Oh, don't worry,' said the man of 
the world, 'I'll be back.'"
