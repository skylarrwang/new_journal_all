Holy Land, U.S.A. 
It's a typical case of bringing the moun-
tain to Mohammed. As long as the mountain 
is plaster of Paris and Mohammed is a fanny-
packed fortysomething. · 
It's "Holy Land, U.SA." 
· These brightly lit words and accompany-
ing 50-foot high cross shine down on Inter-
state 84 near Waterbury, beckoning motorists 
to find their salvation on top of Pine Hill. It's 
an enticement to the kitsch-loving imagina-
cion. 


John Greco (lAW '25) started building 
Holy Land in 1956 as an alternative pilgrim-
age for the devout who couldn't afford to 
make the trip to Jerusalem. Greco bought the 
17-acre plot for $13,000, then began to build 
his city. Soon Pine Hill began to fill with 
poured concrete Virgin Marys, mannequins 
dressed as saints, pipe railings, and all sizes of 
decorative plastic flowers. Walking through 
Holy Land is like a trip through a fonune 
cookie factory, with pithy sayings like "The 
world is fragile, handle with prayer" at every 
turn. Greco forged his miniature Jerusalem 
out of other people's garage sale junk .. 


And they carne. 


In the early '80s, the amusement park-like 
shrine welcomed 40,000 disciples a day, often 
arriving in bus-loads. Donations from visiting 
tourists paid for the upkeep and expansion of 
Holy Land, and Greco added items: every-
thing from concrete grottoes to the Dead Sea. 
With the new funds, Greco created a 200-foor 
long replica of the catacombs, then a minia-
ture of the villages of the 12 tribes oflsrael. 
All this "for the glory of God," according 
to Greco. As a child, Greco wanted to become 
a priest, but he opted for a more lucrative 
career as a lawyer. Holy Land was Greco's con-
tribution to the fa.ith. He chose Pine Hill 
because the terrain bn the hilltop reminded 
him of Palestine. 


Holy Land's heyday ended in the mid-
'80s as Greco (who was 70 when he started 
the project) became too frail to maintain the 
site himself any longer. Holy Land withered 
with Greco, closing its gigantic gate to the 
public when Greco became too ill to supervise 
the project. Those who heed the call today 
and make the pilgrimage will find that the 
largest replica of Jerusalem this side of, well, 
anywhere, has been all but worn away by 
mother nature. 


Greco died in 1986, leaving Holy Land in 
the charge of the same order of nuns that had 
cared for him in his last days, the Religious 
Teachers Filipini. Today's Holy Land hosts 
graffiti and beer bottles instead of worship-
pers. The sisters currently have plans for the 
crumbling Holy Land, but aren't discussing 
what form their repairs will take. While the 
future of Holy Land is being decided, the sis-
ters concentrate on keeping the cross lit, giv-
ing commuters below a little kitsch to ponder, 
if nothing else.
