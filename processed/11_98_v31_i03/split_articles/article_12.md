Faith No More 
As church bells pealed through the Silli-
man courtyard, I sat down for a conversation 
with Chris Mooney (SM '99), one of the lead-
ers of the Yale Society of Humanists, Atheists 
and Agnostics (YSHM). More than fifty sim-
ilar groups have been established on campuses 
nationwide in the last year in association with 
the Council for Secular Humanism. The 
YSHAA's unremarkable mission is to advance 
free and rational thought, but the activities 
they organize to secure Yale for the godless 
seem bizarre to the uninitiated. 


The group's activist agenda includes a 
campaign against Yale's mandatoty Freshman 
Assembly, because it involves prayer. 
They also want Yale to install a 
secular chaplain. "We actually 
have someone lined up to fill this 
position-a member of the 
_.. ........., _ _... 
American Humanist Associ-
ation," said Mooney. "We want someone 
who would be useful to show that Yale 
respects all modes of thought." 


The YSHAA held a Superstition Bash 
on Cross Campus on Friday, November 
13. Brave Yale students tested their fate by 
walking under a huge ladder and Mooney 
smashed a mirror while spilling salt over 
both shoulders at 13:13 {1:13 p.m.}. 


The organization also aims to create a 
community of non-believers. At this point 
Mooney's efforts consist largely of a weekly 
keg party in his suite, which is decorated with 
an eight-inch squeaking nun and posters bear-
ing legends )ike "HELL? NO, WE WON'T GO!" 
and "Anti-Priest, Pro Altar-Boy." 


The society does have more serious goals. 
"The main concerns of the association are 
separation of church and state and First 
Amendment rights." Mooney also sees a con-
nection between "free-thinkers" and a variety 
of other causes on campus. ~The homosexuals 
have it even worse than we do, and we have a 
common enemy in the church. But it's hard 
to form alliances since, if you're gay, about the 
only thing that could be worse would be to 
come out as godless, too." 


The journey towards unbelief was a short 
one for Mooney, who grew up amidst the 
miasma of Catholicism and bacchanalia that 
is New Orleans. Reared by an atheist family, 
he recalls feeling different from all the other 
families in his neighborhood, where the Vir-
gin Mary was a popular lawn ornament. "But 
the time that I realized there was no God 
acutely was when I was a junior or senior in 
high school. It mattered to me a lot because I 
was really unhappy and angry, and being mad 
at religion was one way to get it out." 


I asked Mooney how he evolved his phi-
losophy of tolerance and openness out of this 
initial anger and prejudice. "Yeah, it took a 
long time," he admits. "But 
I 
think 
with 
rational 
th~ught anyone would get 
there eventually." This para-
dox seems endemic to the 
entire movement: a collec-
tion of "free thinkers" united 
by vitriol against the foolishly 
superstitious. When I asked if 
Mooney would like to see all 
organized religion eradicat-
ed, he demurred, saying, "That 
would be a fascist goal. I'm not a fascist." 


But when pressed he admits, "I think it 
would be better." 


Although a march against Batte! 
Chapel would surely generate controversy, 
YSHM currently might be said to suffer from 
a lack of opposition. "Secular humanists love 
America. At least, the one that got founded. If 
you look at the great thinkers of the Enlight-
enment, all their arguments and conceptions 
of human rights and maximizing happiness-
we're just kicking ourselves that we're not in 
the Enlightenment now." Yale's Campus Cru-
sade for Christ's efforts notwithstanding, 
rationalism and empiricism overrule piety 
inside classrooms and out. Nevertheless, 
Mooney sees his organization as part of the 
old guard against a rising wave of dangerous 
mysticism. "I think there's a potential to enter 
a new Enlightenment, but also a new Middle 
Ages." He reads me a quote from Carl Sagan, 
one of the patron saints of his movement: 
"It's a foreboding I have, maybe ill-placed, 
of an America in my children's generation, or 
my grandchildren's generation, when, clutch-
ing our crystals and religiously consulting our 
horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep 
decline, unable to distinguish between what's 
true and what feels good, we slide, almost 
without noticing, into superstition and dark-
ness. "
