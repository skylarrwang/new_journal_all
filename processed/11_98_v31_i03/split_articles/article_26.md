EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
what these kids were doing so close to campus.

But the line between town and gown isn't
as distinct as some would like to imagine.
Mark makes his living begging and hustling
around campus. "Do I get guns for Yale kids?
No, just drugs, no weapons," he says. But he
has no objections to the idea, and quickly
turns to business. "Nothing under $50 will
get you a gun. It would take 24 hours for it to
go down."

Mark's words sound like they're straight
out of a movie. Is it really as simple as he says?
"It's easy to get a gun," says Officer Jones. "It's
knowing the right people and putting the
word out." But a late night cup of coffee buys
an acquaintance with Mark. "If you want a
nine millimeter automatic, it'll cost you about
$150, $200, with bullets." By the next afternoon Mark has located someone who is willing to meet us that night on the New Haven
Green. "He's an honest businessman," says
Mark. "He just wants his money and the
transaction's made."

At 9 p.m. intermittent lamps light paths
across the Green. It would be difficult to spot
a man with a backpack standing in the shadow of a tree and impossible to hear the gun-
shots on Kensington Street. At this hour most
Yalies don't go anywhere near the Green's ominous dark stretches. Bearing John's warning in
mind, we break our date with the dealer. The
gun is waiting for the next person ready to put
up the cash.
