Asian currency 
depreciations 
force students 
to make 
unexpected 
sacrifices. 
A 
lot of people thought I ~iled-1 was 
cially independent in my life, and having a job on cam-
pus sounded like a clistant story to me-until the sec-
ond semester of my freshman year." Last Christmas 
break, the one holiday during the year when students are free from 
work. marked the beginning of a painful downhill slide for Gary and 
other Asian natives at Yale. In a single day, the Indonesian rupiah lost 
32 
returned 
to Yale for the spring semester and approached the University for finan-
cial assistance. Due to Yale's financial aid policy, international students 
who do not request financial aid upon acceptance must sign a form 
stating that they will not ask for aid during their four years at Yale. 
Gary, who spent dose to $5,000 on personal expenses during the first 
semester of his freshman year, had not hesitated to sign this form. "The: 
THE NEW joURNAL 

signature is fairly binding. A repeal of this form is rare and must go 
under careful scrutiny," says Patricia Wei, an undergraduate admissions 
officer responsible for Asia. Without any aid or loans, Gary's parents 
resorted to borrowing money from friends fof his spring tuition. A 
monthly allowance was now a dteam, and, for the first time, Gary was 
on work-study. He juggled two jobs, one of which overlapped with his 
physics class, preventing him from attending any lectures. 

The worst had not yet struck. On May 16, Gary rerurned home 
for the summer and was confronted not only by economic peril but by 
riots in the streets. "Those people, Indonesians, they were starving. 
They just didn't have the money to eat. It didn't seem to have any rea-
son or rationality. I still believe that it is a miracle that I walked out of it 
alive." The exchange rate was now 16,500 rupiahs to the dollar, one-
eighth of its original value. "My father was basically being asked to pay 
what used to be worth $250,000 per school year." He continues, 
"My luggage, which included all my books and summer 
clothing and computer, was looted during the riots." It 
was not until late June that he was able to leave the 
country and rerurn to New Haven to work full-time 
at a laboratory. 

When Gary's parents realized that they could 
no longer spend a single penny on their son's edu-
cation, they were Speechless. In Asia, parents con-
sider education a priority in raising their childten, 
and financial sacrifice is not considered to be a bur-
den for the purposes of a quality education. The 
financial stability necessary to finance a good education 
has been regarded as normal up until this crisis, and thus it 
has bewildered many parents who have been laid off from 
work. Eugene Auh (CC '99) acknowledges that "a mother of an 
acquaintance back in Korea committed suicide because her husband 
had not told the family about his yearlong unemployment." The sud-
den end to comfortable living has taken Asians by such surprise that 
people are hesitant to reveal their problems, even to family members. 

The currency depreciation has not only obstructed higher education-
it has also ruined parents' dteams of making a committed gift to the 
next generation. 

T 
he economic crisis hit Indonesia harder than any other nation 
in the Asian community, so Gary's experience is one of the few 
extreme cases; however, other students have also been signifi-
candy affected. For Carmen Hui (TD '0 1), who attended Jakarta Inter-
national School in Indonesia, the financial crisis became a mental strain 
as much as an economic one. In March, her parents escaped to Hong 
Kong, and she has not been able to rerurn to Indonesia ever since. She 
has lost contact with many of her high school friends. "We are all sepa-
rated now," said Hui. "I feel like I have lost a great home." Out of all 
the countries she has lived in, she feels the strongest tie to Indonesia. 
Now she has no definite plans to rerum to the place where her identity 
was forged.

As trying as the grief and struggle may be, many Yale students have 
begun to make sacrifices for their Yale education. Some have decided to 
curtail their stay to three years. Others, like Auh, have started to work 
on campus, and some have attempted to maximize their funds by keep-
ing track of the currency market. Laiyee Leong (SY '94, GRD '03) 
rerurned to Yale as a first-year graduate student after working in Singa-
pore as a journalist for four years. Although she receives a full fellowship 
that covers her tuition, Leong must use her earnings for personal 
expenses. Aware that there is now only a fixed amount in her savings 
account, she is much more careful with her money. "When I was com-
ing to Yale this summer, I tried to exchange as litde as possible," she 
says. "The rate had risen to 1.77 Singapore dollars to one U.S. dollar, 
about a 20 percent decrease in currency value. I plan to exchange in 
increments from now on, too." As an undergraduate, she was never 
worried about buying anything at Store 24's high prices. Now 
returning to the same place just four years later, she feels 
like she has been caught in the twilight zone. 

The unexpected financial downfall in Asia has 
been a concern for both currendy enrolled stu-
dents and adtninistrators. "Overall international 
applications dropped for the first time for the 
class of '02," said Wei. "When I went on a 
recruitment trip to Asia this past April, I saw 
fewer numbers of students attending informa-
tion sessions." Although economics professor 
Giancarlo Corserti considers East and Southeast 
Asia to be the only regions where the currency depre-
ciation has led to a major economic depression, the 
admissions office foresees a delayed effect on the class of '03. 
With the recent 50 percent increase in foreign financial aid and the ini-
tiation of a recruitment trip to Latin America, the admissions office is 
trying to maintain Yale's diversity. The last five years have seen a signifi-
cant improvement in the internationalization of Yale; international 
applicants can now submit part of their application online and receive 
information through the newly lengthened brochure. 

"Yale, with its relatively stable financial structure, has been one of 
the least affected universities in the United States," said Wei. Neverthe-
less, as Assistant Dean Mary Li Hsu says, "I do know that a few stu-
dents with whom I am familiar have taken time off from school because 
of financial difficulties related to the economy." Gary is not one of 
them. This semester, along with taking six credits, he works over 20 
hours a week to pay off his bills and loans. Although he no longer can 
afford to spend money on luxuries, he is thankful for being able to stay 
at Yale. As Auh says, "Many of us, including me, are appreciating Yale a 
lot more now."
