''All 
happy families resemble each other," writes Sofya in a 
curling cyrillic script, beginning to copy the manuscript 
her husband has just handed her. The work is arduous: 
many words have been furiously scratched out, margin 
corrections have been recorrected, and arrows Â·point lost words home-. 
ward. She may be the only person who can decipher the mess made by 
her husband's brilliance. Her hand, perhaps, still aches from transcrib-
ing W?tr and Peace. She did it seven times. 


She also bore Count Leo 
Tolstoy 13 children, six of 
whom would not live to see 
their father die. That she was 
fiercely devoted to her husband 
and his art is without question; 
that she was severely mentally 
ill in the final years of her life is 
also doubtless, though not nec-
essarily a consequence of her 
devotion. The same passion 
that made Countess Sofya 
Andreyevna Tolstoy a brilliant 
scribe made her a ruthless 
administrator of her household 
in the closing years of Leo Tol-
stoy's life. The aging Sofya grew 
suspicious of her husband 
(though his octagenarian frame 
could hardly have sustained disloyalty). She kept her physically ailing 
husband awake at night with the racket of her mental maladies: the 
slamming drawers and doors of her searches for the evidence of her hus-
band's betrayal. She rarely slept. Tolstoy wrote in his diary (presumably 
the one for which she searched in vain), "Day and night, she has to 
know my every word and deed, and have everything under her con-
trol." It is because of his wife's illness that Tolstoy's biographies invari-
ably end under the same chapter heading: "Escape." 


On October 28, 1910, at three o'clock in the morning, Leo Tolstoy 
awoke in his bedroom at Yasnaya Polyana, the Tolstoy estate in the sub-
urbs of Moscow, and, deciding he could no longer live under the terror 
of his wife's rule, he began preparations to slip out from under her iron 
fist. The house was unusually still. Sofya had finally fallen asleep after 
stirring all night and Tolstoy seized the opportunity. He was 82 years 
old, weak, and close to death. He packed some things, and accompa-
nied by his doctor, left his home and his wife. The carriage drove to a 
nearby station, where Tolstoy and his doctor boarded a train, a train 
that would gain fame rivaled only by the locomotive that races through 
the pages of AnnaKarenina. 


Tolstoy was bound for 
Shamordino, the home of his 
sister, Marya. Everyone in the 
third-class railroad carriage 
recognized the famous writer, 
and before long passengers 
from throughout the train 
crowded into Tolstoy's car-
riage, where he expounded on 
pacifism and politics. After a 
six-hour train ride, the Count 
and his doctor arrived . at 
Kozyolsk, where they spent 
the night, switching trains in 
the morning and embarking 
again for Shamordino. 


The 
arduous 
journey 
began to take its toll on the 
writer. As Tolstoy shivered in 
the cold train compartment, his doctor decided the author could not 
complete the trip. The next stop of the train bringing Tolstoy to the 
end of his life was the obscure town of Astapovo, where the station mas-
ter offered to house the ailing Tolstoy. 


On November 6, still too sick to travel, Tolstoy remained in bed at 
the station master's home. He was in pain. His days marooned in 
Astapovo allowed his family to catch up with him, and soon he was sur-
rounded by his children in the small room. Tolstoy continued to write 
in his diary, even in his final hours. His November 6 entry: "Life is a 
dream, death is an awakening." 


Sofya too came to Astapavo, but she was not allowed to see her bus-
