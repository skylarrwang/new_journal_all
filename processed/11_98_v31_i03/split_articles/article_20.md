Then tht disciples came and said f() him, "Why do you speak in para~

Matthew 13:10~12 
'' T 
he hotel is getting busier and busier, like a pot of boil~ 
ing water. And all the employees are frogs. And the 
water gets hotter and hotter, but really really slowly, 
so no one notices it, until one day the frogs are boil~ 
ing, and the hotel is running really well." 
John Pluecker (ES '0 1) is relating the gospel according to Linda 
Lbby, General Manager of the Omni Hotel, where he delivers room 
service. "I don't really know what to make of it," he said. "I guess she 
wanted it to mean everyone works harder and harder? Maybe?" 
One thing's for sure: the Omni is boiling.


The controversies surrounding the Omni 
began in 1995, when developer David Cordish decided to resuscitate 
the abandoned Park Plaza H otel. In exchange for providing several 
hundred jobs and a sure boon to the moribund Chapel Square Mall, 
New Haven diverted $9.9 million to the project. At Mayor John 
DeStefano's coaxing, Cordish agreed that he would eventually sign a 
neutrality agreement stipulating that the new hotel's management 
would not discuss the formation of a union with its employees. With~ 
out this sort of treaty, management has every right to intimidate would~ 
be unionists in the weeks before their election. After a few closed semi~ 
nars on pay cuts, union corruption, and job loss, most workers decide 
to vote "no." More importantly, under a neutrality agreement, a card 
count over several months, rather than a one-time election, decides the 
fa.te of the union. Employees can join the revolution as slowly as they 
please. 
Then came the Omni. The international hotel syndicate bought a 
controlling stake in the new development and demanded that the bus 
stops on the Greeri be relocated on behalf of its guests' right not to see 
poor people, and put off the neutrality agreement on behalf of its right 
to keep them poor. The only good will in New Haven that the compa~ 
ny did keep was the city's generous $9.9 million donation, which it 
used to build an ostensibly anti-union luxury hotel. Even worse, when 
it finally opened, after years of delay, the Omni drew banquets and 
other events away from union shops like Yale. 
Locals 34 and 35 became irate, according to Connor Martin (TC 
'99), a banquet waitress and member ofLocal217's Omni Organizing 
Committee. In 1996, they'd won a bitter fight against subcontracting 
certain dining hall jobs to non-union employees of an outside firm. 
Suddenly Yale was using the Omni as a kind of luxury subcontractor. 
Money that had once gone to unionized workers was going (in lesser 
proportion, of course) to non-union ones. 
As soon as the hotel opened for business, protests Bared up. A coali~ 
tion formed out of clergy, Yale students, and union members, who felt 
that 9.9 million of their tax dollars entitled the city to viable jobs, not 
just simple surplus value extraction. Even I was awakened from my 
ironic slumber long enough to chant, "Linda Libby: No More Fibby!" 
in front of the hotel last winter. 


On October 29, Omni workers voted, by card 
count, overwhelmingly for a union. Soon 
afterwards, management filed a suit before the 
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
They charged Local 217 of the Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees with coercing workers 
to sign union cards. And Libby recently inex~ 
plicably resigned, though some workers say she 
was forced out. 
"If I slack off a little 
Although the New Haven Advocate 
reported that Libby publically avowed that 
the hotel was negotiating a neutrality agr~ 
ment with Local 217, no such agreement 
ever came. In fa.ct, the hotel brought in 
attorney Jay Krupin, a nationally renowned 
union-buster, to try and settle things down. 
The Omni was looking for a fight, and l 
Linda Libby was still spinning fibbies. 
oi 
bit at work, and I'm 
pro-union, that could 
mean my job."


But even Krupin's cunning couldn't step i. 
to the solidarity of a depressed and desperate community intent on i 
shoring up what few good jobs were still possible. Demonstrators f 
proved vigilant enough to prevent the Governor of Puerto Rico, the ~ 
Honorable Pedro Rosello, from staying at the hotel, and some Omni i 
events were moved to the Law School. A boycott threatened by the a 
coalition finally pushed Yale to authorize its (anti-) labor lawyer, Brian 
Tunney, to help the two sides negotiate a neutrality agreement, which 
was signed on Aprill5 of this year. 
All of this culminated in October 29's card count: of 154 eligible 
employees, 112 agreed to unionize. I asked Martin why the union won 
so easily. "Job security," she said. "There's a company attempt to create 
grievance procedures [for wrongful firings], but it doesn't work at all. A 
grievance procedure is stipulated in a contract, and right now, not hav-
ing a contract, any policy that the hotel has for its employees can be 
changed at the drop of a hac. We have no guarantees.,Until it's guaran~ 
teed in a contract, we have no protection." 
Although they would not go on record, other hotel workers agreed. 
One said he had signed a union card even though the Omni considers 
him management, because he was worried about losing his job. Even 
workers who didn't sign union cards cited fear of management reprisal 
as 
their 
motivation. 
Pluecker 
himself 
expressed some concerns about unionism: 
"When I was signing my union card, I was 
like, 'Do I really want to do this? Is it going to 
come back to me?' If I slack off a little bit at 
work, and I'm pro-union, that could mean 
my job." 


For Martin, however, respect for workers 
is almost as important as secure jobs. "They 
have these Omni Service Champion Awards 
where they give out special awards each 
month. Anyway, one month, there was a 
Mardi Gras theme, and the managers all were 
having a private party beforehand. Then they 
carne out and Linda Libby was wearing a 
crown, and everyone else was w~ing these 
very elaborate masks. Now, the normal work-
ers 
weren,t 
given 
masks-only 
the 
managers. And the 
managers 
walked 
around through the 
ballroom where every-
one else was sitting, 
and threw little beads 
at the workers, and 
then went up and 
gave their presentation." 
"In some sense, we 
already have a union. 
W e stand up for each 
other on the job."


On top of that, she said, "The uniform is 
horrible. It's a polyester tuXedo." Some of the 
hotel's employees aren't even allowed on the 
elevators because "they smell bad," according 
to Martin. 
Pluecker, too, has suffered his share of 
indignities. "There's this one guy who called 
me and I went into his room one night, and 
there was someone in his bed. A very thin, 
scraggly looking white man, and a very over-
weight African-American lady, a prostitute, 
lying in bed, drinking a beer and smoking a 
cigarette. It was kind of traumatic. He stays in 
the hotel all the time." 
Paradoxically, the more the Omni makes a 
show of respecting its workers, the more it 
highlights how little it actually does. "They 
have this slogan," Pluecker said. "'The Power 
of One.' You don't know about the Power of 
One? It says that whenever there is any prob-
lem, you are fully empowered to make a deci-
sion." Of course, it also implies that what's 
really important are individual performances 
as opposed to worker solidarity. The Omni 
calls all of its employees "associates." It pro-
motes monthly "Service Champions." It even 
passed out an "associate opinion survey," on 
which the last question was "Does this survey 
make you feel like your opinion matters?" I 
asked Pluecker whether his does. "Sort of." 
And the "Power of One?" "It's just a slogan," 
he said. 
Martin reports a more serious incident. 
"One member of management called a group 
of black and Latino workers who were eating 
while on a break a 'bunch of little monkeys,' 
and asked the manager to get rid of them. 
T hose things are brought to the boss manager 
and dealt with usually, although the guy is still 
there. The grievance procedure is supposed to 
have some sort of committee, but it doesn't 
exist as far as I know." Pluecker also alleged 
incidents of racism against Latinos. 
As a result of this type of condescension, 
"the 
Human 
Resources 
Depart-
ment was taken aback 
by how well we orga-
nized 
this 
hotel, 
because 
they 
don't 
think that their work-
ers are capable of orga-
nizing," said Martin. 
In fact, worker solidar-
ity at the Omni may act as a counter-hegemo-
ny against the Omni's culture of corporate 
kitsch. Martin said, "In some sense, we 
already have a union. We stand up for each 
other on the job, and that's what a union is all 
about.'' Since the card count, "there's been an 
amazing change in the way people I work 
with think about themselves as workers, the 
way they think about themselves and the 
power they have in society. It's the s~nse 
among workers that 'I have dignity, and I 
deserve respect,"' said Martin. 


"What the union is all about" became 
perfectly clear on October 30, the day after 
the card count. Three union members, 
including Martin, took over a worker/man-
agement meeting led by Libby and the hotel's 
Director of Human Resources, Paul Pinto. 
They presented Libby with a blown-up peti-
tion, tied with a silk ribbon, and signed by 
109 union supponers, including Jesse Jack-
son. Unionists planted in the crowd applaud-
ed, setting off cheers from the rest of the audi-
ence. When Libby finally spoke, Martin said, 
she was alrriost drowned out. "Yes, [the cards] 
do demonstrate a majority, but we're not rec-
ognizing them, because we think the union 
intimidated you," said Libby.
