The Lady Vanishes 
When the city of New Haven demolished 
the old Malley's 4epartment store on the cor-
ner of Church and George Streets, it 
destroyed a landmark more than a century 
old. In its place now sits a gaudy sign welcom-
ing visitors to "New Haven: An All-American 
City." 


But beneath the empty lot lurks a mystery 
that has haunted the city since before the turn 
of the century-the unsolved murder of 20 
year old Jennie E. Cramer. 


In 1881, New Haven was the quintessen-
tial New England city: refined women and 
men paraded down tree-lined streets, the 
economy boomed, and the city bustled with 
the intellectual life its prized university pro-
vided. On August 6, however, the city was 
shaken from its Victorian complacency by the 
discovery of a grisly and mysterious murder. 


A pamphlet published after the murder 
testifies to the charms of the victim, a middle 
class girl: "She was well-known and well-liked 
for her beauty, which was undoubtedly strik-
ing, and for her high spirits and good compa-
ny, although she was not well educated, nor 
particularly attractive mentally." 


One of Cramer's most persistent admirers 
was James Malley, Jr., the nephew of Edward 
Malley, namesake and owner of the famous 
Malley's Department store. As the story goes, 
Cramer and Malley spent the evening of 
Wednesday, August 3, with Walter Malley, 
James's cousin, and Walter's friend Blanche 
Douglass. 


When Cramer did not return home that 
night, her mother was frantic. She interrogat-
ed the Malley boys and Douglass about her 
daughter's whereabouts. Douglass said that 
the two had spent the previous evening at the 
Elliot Boarding House for Women, but that 
they had split up that morning. The Malley 
boys sent a note to Mrs. Cramer saying that 
they had not seen her daughter. 


Two days later, Cramer's body was discov-
ered by a fisherman, Asa Curtiss, near Savin 
Rock on the Long Island Sound. The autopsy 
revealed that she had not drowned. She bad 
been poisoned with laudanum. 


According to court documents, an investi-
gation began promptly, and the Malley boys 
and Douglass were the first witnesses called in 
for questioning. All three denied having seen 
Cramer after the evening of August 3, and 
families and friends provided alibis for the 
threesome starting the morning of August 4. 
When Douglass was questioned further, how-
ever, she revealed that she had lied about her 
and Cramer's whereabouts: they had spent the 
evenings of August 3 and August 5 at the 
Malley mansion. 


On August 15, New Haven police arrest-
eel both Malley boys and Douglass. Edward 
Malley promptly offered a $1000 reward for 
information leading to the apprehension of 
the "real" murderer. The New Haven com-
munity was outraged at the elder Malley's 
involvement in the inquiry, and became suspi-
cious of the slow pace of the investigation. 


The Nau Havm Unum accused the police 
department of "masterful inactivity" and 
argued forcefully that it was "no time for dilly 
dallying." 


The New Haven coroner's jury, the equiv-
alent of today's grand jury, accused the three-
some of "not having fear of God before their 
eyes, but being moved and seduced by the 
instigation of the devil, wickedly contriving 
one Jennie Cramer, late of said town of New 
Haven, with poison willfully, feloniously and 
of their malice aforethought to kill and mur-
der." The trial date was set for June, 1882. 


In the interim, the Cramer story explod-
ed, gaining regional attention and appearing 
repeatedly on the front page of the Nau 111rk 
Tim~s. All the makings of a good story were 
there: power, money, and se:x. Pictures of the 
victim abounded in New Haven. In April, a 
pamphlet appeared that implicated the Malley 
family in the crime. Although the Malleys 
asked their servants to buy up the pamphlet, 
several copies found their way into the pub-
lic's hands, and the demand was so great that 
it went into a second printing. 


Afrer a trial of nearly three months, both 
Malley boys and Douglass were acquitted. 


The people of New Haven osrracized the 
Malley family, suspecting their involvement in 
the murder. People refused to shop at their 
store and the Malleys were rebuffed by the 
society that had once revered them. "The 
incident helped focus the community on the 
pervasive class divisions inÂ· New Haven," said 
history professor Robin Winks, who lectured 
on the Cramer murder to the New Haven 
Colony Historical Society last October. 


"A woman who used to teach English at 
Yale was walking down the street with a Mal-
ley's bag and someone approached her and 
said, 'You must be new here. It's not proper to 
shop at Malley's-people around here don't 
go there anymore,'" said fames Campbell of 
the New Haven Colony Historical Society. 


Malley's might have been replaced by the 
"All-American City," but beneath the facade 
lie 
unanswered 
questions-the 
murder 
remains unsolved.
