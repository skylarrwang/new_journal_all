They are all in the same city, on the same street, 
flowing past each other, bouncing off each other, 
yet isolated in their own world. They each have 
their own concerns, worries, and reasons to hurry; 
they are aware of their surroundings, yet so often 
unaware of the camera that sees them. 
There is an unwritten language, an implicit 
choreography, spoken and followed on the street: 
when you walk, where you stand, where you look, 
when you wait, who you touch, and what you do. 
These interactions are taken for granted, yet they 
determine our movements and c'eate a strange world 
when frozen in time. 
These photographs were all taken on Fifth Avenue 
in Manhattan over the course of the last two months. 
They represent a portion of a year-long project 
centered on the people of Manhattan's streets and the 
act of taking these pictures.
