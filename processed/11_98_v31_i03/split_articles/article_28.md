It's four o'clock in the afternoon and Sharon is already at Dana's house. 
She's standing on the steps asking for her. Dana comes out wearing a coat, 
stomping her boots, blinking her eyes Like she just woke up. "Sharon, it's 
damn cold out here," she says. "Why you dragging me out of bed?" But 
Dana's not too cold or tired to know that Sharon wants some drugr. Dana 
holds out her hand. Sharon gives her some money. Dana keeps her hand 
out. Sharon gives her more. If Sharon wants Dana to go out and get her 
some, Sharon had best be prepared to give some back. What's fair is fair. 
For the New Haven Police Department, recent crackdowns on vice 
are all about fairness. Despite comforting statistics citing the decline in 
violent crime nationwide, crimes once viewed by police as too mun-
dane for serious attention now plague the city. In the mid-'80s, when 
New Haven's drug wars hit their peak, police had no choice but to con-
centrate on the wave of murders, burglaries, and assaults that accompa-
nied the drug trade. Now at the end of the '90s, nights of violence and 
fear have subsided, even if the drug trade has not. Until just a few 
months ago, however, the police continued to target felony offenders, 
despite the surge in misdemeanors. "We weren't listening to what the 
community wanted," says Sergeant Everett Nichols of the Fair Haven 
district. "What we thought were mundane crimes were what the com-
munity wanted out_of their lives. Let's face it, a murder doesn't happen 
every day, but the drunk will be on your steps every day." Arresting 
everyone from drunks to kids playing their music too loudly, the police 
have been trying to make the streets of New Haven quieter and more 
livable for law-abiding citizens. In the past two months, the police 
department has completed four busts, arresting more than 50 women 
and men in its biggest attempt yet to erase the misdemeanor most 
closely related to the drug trade and violence: prostitution. 
'1 don't Like to call it prostitution on my part," Dana says. Dana doem't 
tvm start off a typical day knowing if she'll have to turn tricks. She starts off 
the day knowing she's going to get high, but that won't happen until Sharon 
comes around and sends her out to buy some stuff When Dana jim wakes 
up she ftels normal normal enough to Lie in bed and watch TV And she's 
Mrmal enough to chase her grandkids around the house or cook up a meal 
or talk for a few hours with that reporter who comes over from the universi-
~ But by the time Sharon comes around, Dana already wants her drugr 
and she's ready to risk arrest to get Sharon some, plus a bwck of her own. 
When Dana gets a bwck, the size of an Advil she breaks it in half One 
half keeps her high for 30 minutes, so she can get a full hour from one bwck. 
At the end of the hour Dana starts getting headaches. She's got to smoke 
some crack cocaine. So Dana starts woking around for money: two dollars 
left over from what her husband gave her for giving it up last night, three 
dolltzrs from the cans and bottles she's been collecting. .. not enough to buy a 
TUJrmal $10 bag. ?:hat's when Dana puts on her jeans and heads out to the 
Â·Ho-StrolL " 
The prostitution hot spot for downtown New Haven, or the Ho-
Stroll as it's known on the streets, runs along Chapel Street and Edge-
wood Avenue between Howe Street and Sherman Avenue, a block up 
from Pierson College. A hot spot can start with just one or two girls out 
on the corner. Johns drive by and start recognizing that spot as a place 
to go to "take care of business." Women start recognizing that spot as a 
good place to make money, and traffic grows until it becomes the place 
in the district to make a transaction. With prostitution comes drug 
dealing and with drug dealing come gangs. Gang activity brings loud 
music, yelling, and even gunshots until three in the morning. "When 
you get nine, ten girls on the street, they're noisy, their dates are noisy, 
they're leaving their narcotics around-then it's a quality of life issue," 
says Nichols. Eliminating prostitution is not an easy task. Most busts 
break up a hot spot only to push prostitutes and johns to new parts of 
the district and city, new intersections that will become new hot spots. 
"We're like a M.AS.H. unit," says Nichols. "We're just a quick fix." 
Getting her fix is easier for Dana now that she's been around a whik, 
now that she's known. On the streets they call her the Bag Lady or Ma Duke 
out of respect. Dana can walk the Ho-Stroll in jeans; she tkJem't even need 
to comb her hair. On most days, she walks tkJwn Howe dragging her 
garbage bagr, picking up cans and bottles on the way. A new car skws down 
in front of her. A couple of Yale students walk past Dana on their way to 
Pizza House, but they're not who she's wokingfor. She walks straight to the 
car. A man leans out and asks her, "}Ou working?" He woks Like he's coming 
from an office. "Uh-huh, "she answers and keeps on walking. The car circks 
around the bwck and swws tkJwn again in front of Dana. She gets in. He 
drives dtnmz the street and pulls over. "If he wants to smile at you, it's going 1 
to cost him," says Dana. "If he wants to sit next to you, it's going to cost him. i 
If he wants to put his arm around you, that'll cost him even more. "Dana 
never sets a price. She just sticks out her hand and waits. 
"On the first, second, and third of the month it's real weird peopk from 
the veteran's hospitals, "says Dana. "They come in taxi cabs with their dis-
abilities checks. They pay you $200 to sit and talk with them and watch 
them ... "She moves her hand up and tkJwn to indicate masturbation. Dana 
only sees the veterans once a month. Usually it's married white men from 
the suburbs, businessmen, and cops. She likes the white men. "They always 
strung out and paranoid and give up their money real easy, " she says. "I 
always tell them I need the money for my family. "Dana Likes it best when 
men give her money before she agrees to tkJ anything. The man drives by her 
house and Dana runs inside and pretends to give the money to her family. 
When she gets in the car again, he'll give her more money to go to his house. 
'1 can get $300 for smoking his crack and ktting him eat pussy," Dana 
laughs. She stops there, though. If he wants her to give it up, Dana just 
sticks out her hand for money and, as soon as she gets it, opens the tkJor and 
runs out. In the 15 years she's been smoking crack cocaine, Dana claims she 
has only given it up to "the bitch, "her husband, and he 'pays for it, too. 
These past two months the police department's work on sting oper-
ations has paid off in countless arrests. In each operation, an undercov-
er officer in an unmarked car drives to a hot spot and strikes up a con-
versation with a girl on the street. He records the entire conversation,
