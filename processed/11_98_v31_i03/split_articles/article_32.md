A Land in Full
In his new novel, Tom Wolfe devours '90s America.
by Ro nen G ivony
A Man in Full, Tom Wolfe (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1998), pp. 742.
Among American writers of the 20th cen-
tury, perhaps only Tom Wolfe (GRD '57) can
be said to have drawn consistendy definitive
pictures of individuals and society from not
one, not two, but three decades. It was Wolfe's
reporting that captured San Francisco's '60s
counterculture in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test, and then went on to show the death
throes of black nationalism in Radi~al Chic &
Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers. In the '70s, he
coined what came to be the quintessential tide
of the country's baby boomers-"The Me
Generation" -and wrote about a nation mov-
ing in both ambition and direction toward the
heavens in The Right Stuff In the '80s, he
walked the streets of New York City-"where
things were happening!" -for six years and
produced his first novel, The Bonfire of the
Vanities, one of the decade's best-selling books
and perhaps the final statement of its greed
and corruption. Now, Wolfe is back with his
second novel, A Man in Fu/4 a book that tries
to capture the '90s with the same skills that
have made the past 30 years essentially his.

What has separated Wolfe from his con-
temporaries, as well as most of his recent liter-
ary predecessors, is his devotion to a detailed
realism, which demands painstaking research
and complete immersion in the surroundings
he chooses to write about. In his 1973 book,
The New jounullism, Wolfe advanced a theory
of nonfiction as an art form that would even-
tually come to replace the novel. In a 1989lit-
erary manifesto ("Stalking the Billion-Footed
Beast") published in Harper's, he modified
and added to this theory, claiming that Amer-
ican fiction must return to the kind of ambi-
tious, realistic, socially relevant "big novels"
once produced abroad by Dickens, Zola, and
Balzac and in our own country by Dreiser,
Sinclair Lewis, and Steinbeck.

Such a diehard commitment to tireless,
down-in-the-trenches reporting, as well as
direct interaction with those he writes about,
has come to be a staple of American journal-
ism, but has kept Wolfe, for the most part,
outside of the highbrow literary establish-
ment. As John Updike has written, Wolfe's
writing is thought by many to be not litera-
ture, but entertainment.

Wolfe is still best known for just how
much damned fun his books are to read.
Wolfe's
~tyle-his kinetic, excited prose,
jammed. full of exclamation marks, italicized
phrases, onomatopoeic sound bites, and
inside jokes at his characters' expense--has set
him apart in an age which increasingly
believes that good fiction is abstract fiction. A
quick survey of prominent postwar writers-
Thomas
Pynchon,
Jorge
Luis
Borges,
Vladimir Nabokov-reveals writing that has
turned away from strict reporting of the
everyday world to increasingly chaotic, frag-
mented, absurd depictions oflife.

Wolfe's first venture into fiction, Bonfire,
represents his inlplicit rejection of this kind of
writing. In his own words, Bonfire was an
attempt to "cram as much of New York City
as possible between two covers." The public
eagerly responded, even if the critics claimed
the book's half-hearted ending, lack of emo-
tional depth, and solely external characters
made it fall one step shon of greamess. If Bon-
fire represented a compression of Gotham, A
Man in FuU attempts a much larger project:
cramming America between two covers.

Wolfe has adjusted every aspect of his sto-
rytelling for this increase in scope. Eleven
years in the writing, A Man in FuU weighs in
at well over 700 pages, and includes several
hundred characters, four subplots, and
sprawling descriptions of both the Georgia
countryside and the Northern California
urban belt. It also features Wolfe's usual fare of
serious reporting sprinkled with li~ral doses
of humor. Like Charlie Croker, the book's
main figure, the chief characteristic of A Man
in FuU is its massive size.

The book opens during a quail hunt at
Croker's 29,000-acre Adanta plantation,
Turpmcime. Croker is the All-American guy
whose presence is felt at every point of the
book. Sixty years old, a decorated Vietnam vet
and former college football star, Croker has
raised himself up from the poveny of south-
ern Georgia ("din poor and common as pig
tracks") to become one of the most inlponant
real estate developers in Atlanta. He's dumped
his first wife and now carries on his arm an
achingly gorgeous 28 year old named ~rena,
who, at half of Charlie's age, "has Second
Wife written all over her." His many praises
are sung all over Atlanta, and even his own
servants at Turpmcime have written a song in
his honor:

Charlie Croker was a man in full.
He had a back like a Jersey bull.
Didn't like okra, didn't like pears.
He liked a gal that had no hairs.
Charlie Croker! Charlie Croker! Charlie
Croker!

Still, Charlie is not without his problems:
his latest venture, a multimillion dollar com·
plex built· during Atlanta's 1996 Olympics,
lovingly named Croker Concourse, has
become a hideously expensive Aop. The banks
are calling about the 800 million dollars-
