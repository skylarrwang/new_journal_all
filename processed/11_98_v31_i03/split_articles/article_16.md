band, for fear that her presence would upsetÂ· him too much. She 
remained outside the house, with the crowds of peasants who had 
flocked to respect the great man. Only a handful of those present had 
probably ever read Tolstoy's novels, in which he denies the existence of 
great men. 

There is no contemporary analogy for what it must have been like 
for the station master to have Leo Tolstoy as a guest, albeit an unwilling 
one. No intellectual today commands the reverence that Tolstoy did in 
his Russia. Perhaps no intellectual ever has achieved such popular 
respect before signing with Hades, that unparalleled literary agent. 

On November 7 it became clear that Tolstoy's journey would end 
in unlikely Astapovo. At half past five in the morning, Sofya was finally 
admitted into the room where her husband was deep in a sleep from 
which he would never awaken. Walking to his bed, Sofya stood over her 
husband, and said, "I have never loved anyone but you." 

The body of Tolstoy was returned to Yasnaya Polyana by train. 
Thousands of peasants gathered to pay respeCts to the Count. His body 
was carried from the estate to a 
plot that Tolstoy h;ld long ago 
selected as his burial ground, 
on the edge of a ravine in the 
Zakaz forest, by four of his 
sons. 

Soon after Alexandra's visit, Ilya was hospitalized for what proved to 
be cancer, a cancer which quickly consumed his body. Alexandra visited 
Ilya in the hospital whenever she could, attending to her brother with 
the devotion of Natasha to the dying Prince Andrei, two of Leo's liter-
ary children. Ilya's sickness did nothing to change the ways of the itiner-
ant Nadya. His physical suffering was great, but he welcomed it. He 
would not take the morphine offered to him by the doctors: "I have 
sinned much in my life. I have been sent this suffering in atonement, so 
as to prepare myself. I must bear it, for the sake of God." 

Nadya was at his side that morning, trying to convince him to take 
the morphine. He could not be persuaded to ease the pain, and Alexan-
dra could not persuade Nadya to stay that evening. llya's wife told 
Alexandra that she was leaving. "Don't," Alexandra importuned, "llya 
will die tonight." But Nadya would not change her mind. 

That night Alexandra sat beside Ilya, holding his hand. When she 
returned from the hospital the next morning, Alexandra's friends, see-
ing her smiling face, devoid of grief, inquired as to the health of her 
brother. "He is dead," she 
responded. Alexandra wrote, "I 
could not explain why I was 
smiling, why in my soul I 
rejoiced. How could they have
