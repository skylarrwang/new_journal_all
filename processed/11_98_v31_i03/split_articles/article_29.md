Debbie, who is 16, has just come back from 
being out on the street for three days. She never 
says where she is, but is doing okay, so Dana tries 
not to worry too much. Dana has given Debbie 
a lot of freedom to make her own decisions, and 
for the most part she feels that Debbie has made 
some good choices-she only messes around with 
men she knows and she likes marijuana better 
than crack. But Debbie steals. That's why Dana 
hides everything from her daughter: bags, ciga-
rettes, money. '1 can't trust no one in this fami-
ly, "says Dana. Even now, with Debbie dropped 
out of Hillhouse High School and Dana raising 
Debbie's boy, she feels shut out. "My family 
always has something negative to say, " says 
Dana. "There's no love. I hate living here." 

Most prostitutes learn that the criminal 
justice system can do nothing to them. 
"When you're in it for a while and you're 
strung out and you've been through the sys-
tem, it's like, 'Do what you've got to do,'" says 
Nichols. "When they're young you can scare 
them, tell them yo·u can put them in jail for a 
long time. The hard core ones stand on the 
comer with their hips out and smile. Some-
times I think they want to be taken in. They 
need the break." 

As she walks down Howe, aU Dana can 
think about is escape. '1 hold everything on the 
inside. There's so much stress in my lifo, I had to 
have brain surgery last year. Drugs help me get 
these things out, to help me relax. " That's what 
she's thinking about tonight. She sees one car cir-
cling the block, picking up other girls for a while. 
ln the back of her mind she thinks, "Maybe he's 
a cop. " But Dana is 40 years old, her head's 
kiUing her, and she stopped caring a long time 
ago. The john slows down and she walks up to 
him. "You working tonight?" he asks. "Uh-
huh, "she says and steps into his car. Dana holds 
out her hand and asks the man to make it worth 
her time. He gives her 10 dollars to eat her out 
before he makes the bust.
