mom, though she preferred the m-word 
("multiculturalism"), did the same. Still, both 
quickly moved past talk of integration to talk 
of education. Will actually concluded our 
interview by requesting a copy of my article. 
'~ything that'll help for college," he 
explained. They are not merely paying lip ser-
vice to racial harmony. It seems to be an 
important value to them, but it is clearly sec-
ondary to-and in many ways in the service 
of-Wtll's education. 

But aside from a killer college essay;' how 
could attending Wilbur Cross High School, 
where the incoming freshman class of more 
than 400 will dwindle to 175 by graduation 
day, be good for Will's education? While 
Cross' drop-out and success rates on 
statewide exams are much worse than 
Durham's, the New Haven public 
schools still have a lot to offer a 
stood why The New lQrk Times had come call-
ing. ''I'm shocked," she said. 

Why did Will's family take advantage of 
the program while so many others did not? 
For one, they've been more exposed to urban 
life than most suburban whites. The Costellos 
only moved to Durham from semi-urban 
Middletown because they got a good deal on 
a house. "My mom always says, 'Our house is 
in Durham, but our heart is in Middletown,"' 
said Will. Though they moved, they still go to 
a racially mixed Episcopal church in Middle-
town each week during ''America's most segre-
gated hour." Furthermore, Will's mother 
ofren works in low-income communities 
where she helps residents organize after-
school programs and other community 
projects. 

For 
these 
reasons, 
the 
Will gets to 
study with the most 
motivated students in 
Cross rather than the 
slackers of the 
student like Will. In New 
Haven, unlike Durham, 
Will is in all honors 
classes. 

Sure, 
this 
Costellos have a more cos-
mopolitan oudook than 
most of their friends in 
means that Cross 
has lower stan-
dards for gifred 
education, but in 
Will's case it means 
he gets to study with the 
Durham. 

When 
Will's 
mother 
told people that 
her 
son 
was 
going to New 
Haven 
many 
responded with silence. 
most motivated students at 
Cross rather than the slackers of 
the suburbs. For a student who, as 
suburbs. 
"They thought he'd get a 
second-rate education. No 
one said it, but I felt it. They 
were thinking 'Why would you 
allow your son to go there?'" Will's 
teenage friends were less tactful. "They 
were like 'You been shot yet? Been jumped?"' 
he said. 

his mother puts it, is "more sociable 
than studious," this can make a huge dif-
ference. And if it works, and Will excels at 
Cross, he'll have the chance to take classes at 
Southern or Yale, an option not available to 
students in the suburbs. 

Will's old school, despite conventional 
wisdom about suburban high schools, has its 
problems, too. A recent stabbing has brought 
state troopers to the parking lots at the begin-
ning and end of each school day. 

Considering these factors, there must be 
hundreds of kids in the suburbs who could be 
reaping the same benefits. In fact, Will's 
mother assumed they were. She did not think 
of her child's decision as unusual, and 
assumed there were more than 100 students 
just like Will being bused into ordinary New 
Haven high schools each day. She even 
requested a monthly parents' meeting. When 
I told her that Will was one of only five subur-
banites in Project Choice, she finally under-

While Will has remained friends with 
these kids, aided no doubt by his newfound 
"street cred," he referred to them as "double-
sided" ("two-faced" in grown-up speak). They 
listen to rap music and wear baggy jeans, but 
rarely go into New Haven, even to skate-
board. Yet like his mother, who ended our 
interview by urging me to "be kind to 
Durham-there are good people in this 
town," Will has little ire towards his suburban 
peers. A good liberal, he forgives them, for 
they know not what they do. Still, both he 
and his mother see their shortcomings. 

Like a historian, Will's mother provides 
one telling anecdote to explain her son's deci-
sion to leave his school. Last February Wt.ll 
was in Spain, on the kind of trip only a subur-

ban high school could afford to organize. Will 
and his peers were cooped up in a Madrid 
hotel room when die other kids started com-
plaining that there-was no 1V and that the 
Spanish people they had met were rude. As 
his mother put it, Will had a revelation. Sure 
the students from Durham were "great kids," 
but it struck him that he needed a broader 
experience-an experience he felt he could 
get in New Haven. 

In many ways, it's an experience he is get-
ting, but in other ways it is not. Will is excited 
that the students at Cross "have experienced 
more, they're not so sheltered, and they know 
more of what's going on in the world." But 
they haven't been to Spain and they watch an 
awful lot of television. According to the assis-
tant principal, most of Cross' dropouts just sit 
at home and watch 1V all day. And while the 
diversity in New Haven dwarfs that of 
Durham, where Will said only four of the 400 
kids in his school were non-white, there is lit-
tle meaningful interaction between students 
of different races. 

When I was trying to locate a former Pro-
ject Choice student named Tanisha, I went to 
the cafeteria during her lunch period and 
asked the teacher· on duty for help. He and I 
walked around the black side of the lunch-
room asking if anyone knew her whereabouts. 
No one did. Then the teacher stopped, 
looked out across the rest of the lunch room 
at the all-Latino tables and remarked, "That's 
not a Hispanic name, so I guess she isn't here." 

When I moved on to look for Will, whom a 
peer had described as tall and red-headed with 
baggy pants, I found him at a table in the 
library surrounded by the few white kids in 
his grade. 

Still, he insisted he had made non-white 
friends. His mother bragged that all the girls, 
regardless of race, were introducing them-
selves to him since., in her modest, motherly 
opinion, "he's a pretty good-looking guy." 
Certai.nly he's had interactions with minority 
Students that would have been impossible in 
Durham, but his good friends are white 
because, as he says, "I have the most in com-
mon with them." 

While most suburbanites fear urban 
schools, some may put them on a pedestal 
they don't dese.rVe. To a suburban kid alienat-
ed by his peers' closed-mindedness, the shon-
cornings of urban kids can be dismissed as a 
lack of opponunity-an excuse spoiled sub-

urbanites don't have. Yet, if the students from 
Cross went to Madrid, they'd probably want 
to watch television there, too--not that we'll 
ever find out. New Haven's kids will never go 
to Madrid, as long as school funding remains 
based on local property taxes. And it will, 
regardless of Sheff 

The weak goal of the Sheff v. O'Neil deci-
sion was to address racial segregation but not 
financial inequalities. Sure, separate but equal 
is inherently unequal. But isn't integrated and 
unequal unequal as well? Busing in one white 
kid from the suburbs to Cross is only integra-
tion in the Governor Wallace sense. And there 
aren't any minority students being bused into 

Still, Will's experience, while statistically 
negligible, is valuable. His experience has dis-
pelled many of his Durham friends' myths 
about urban education-he hasn't been 
jumped, or shot. Will's new city friends have 
met someone from the great wide world out-
side New Haven. But there are limits. One 
white suburbanite coming into a school with 
more than 1,000 students is not going to 
affect the school's racial isolation. For all the 
insensitivity of the forced busing bureaucrats 
of the late '60s and '70s, they understood that 
social change takes something few Americans 
like: oven social engineering. Surely this is 
what the creators of Project Choice sought to 
avoid, and they succeeded, by crafting a pro-
gram in line with American values. The pro-
gram is voluntary-based on schools luring 
students-and while the state-provided trans-
portation is expensive, there is no attempt to 
take suburban tax dollars and give them to the 
urban schools that need them. 

The program speaks the language of 
American liberal capitalism: "choice" and 
"marketing" with the student as happy con-
sumer-voter. Perhaps if Popeye's Chicken on 
Elm Street "marketed" itself better, white 
Yalies would "choose" to go there. But they 
don't, though the quality of their product is 
no worse than the dining halls' or say, Broad-
way Pizza's. Alas, Project Choice is as Ameri-
can as apple pie, as American as craving 1V It 
shows us who we really are. And Project 
Choice shows us that, despite the Costellos 
and others like them, integration is not a 
choice America is willing to make.
