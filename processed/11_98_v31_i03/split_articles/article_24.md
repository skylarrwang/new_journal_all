Shaw's Supermarket closed at 10 p.m. lase Tuesday. The cus-
tomers packed up and headed out while a security car circled the 
perimeter of the parking .lot. On adjacent Elm Street, a boy 
pulled his jacket over his head, running for cover from the rain. 
Sirens converged on St. Raphael's Hospital two blocks away and a few 
cars sped down Elm coward the suburbs. A little after ten, the rain 
dulled the sound of a gunshot. No one raised an alarm, no police cruis-
ers followed. 


Lase year, the New Haven Police Department recorded 779 gun-
shots, and firearms were used in 19 of the city's 22 homicides. Although 
the department's firearms unit has recovered 165 handguns since Janu-
ary, crime rates have actually dropped in 1998. This year New Haven 
has seen only ten homicides, five committed with 
firearms. The numbers sound promising and Yale 
continues co recover from the 1991 Hillhouse 
Avenue shooting death of junior Christian Prince. 
But after two incidents on Chapel Street this 
fall, guns have resurfaced as a threat co students and 
to the university's image. On October 7 a man fired 
a gun on a New Haven bus near the intersection of 
Chapel and High Streets. Two weeks later, on 
October 23, two groups of teenagers exchanged 
Â·shots at the corner of York and Chapel. Coming on 
the heels of a pair of shootings at the Medical 
School, the Chapel Street events again raised the 
specter of gun violence in Yale's backyard. 


Although the visibility of guns on campus may 
seem unique to this fall, they have never been far 
away. New Haven police have begun to work with 
state and federal agencies to deter straw buying and 
co block the flow of guns into the city. Connecti-
cut's project "Drugfue" has allowed local police 
depanments to pool their forensic evidence: "Every gun leaves its own 
individual mark. There are no two alike-it's like 
1fingerprints," says 
Sullivan. "Now all of this gets put in the computer. It's a great tool." 


And in conjunction with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
Firearms (ATF), New Haven police have begun a study that will trace 
the origin of every gun implicated in a crime. ATF researchers will fol-
low the path of a gun from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer and 
finally to the street. which extends for two blocks between Elm and Chapel. The shot heard 
last Tuesday night came from this area. A second shot followed half an 
hour later. Hours after the October 23 shooting on Chapel Street, the 
Yale Daily News rushed out a special supplement diagramming the 
events. Yet a few blocks away, random gunfire elicits no response. 
Despite the proximity of the Chapel Street shootings to campus, no 
Yale student has been shot, or shot at, in years. But before New Haven's 
plague of gun viole"nce fades into the background again, it's wonh ask-
ing where the guns come from. 


'' H
ere's a list of guns purchased by one 
person-49 guns," says Captain 
Brian Sullivan, Head of Detectives 
for the New Haven Police Department. "This guy 
bought a lot of guns at various sports places. Some 
of those guns ended up in shootings and murders. 
He was one of the lase straw purchasers in New 
Haven." "Straw buyers" take advantage of differing 
state and local laws by legally purchasing dozens of 
guns in one area and reselling them on the black 
market. New Haven police now run detailed back-
ground checks on anyone who purchases multiple 
guns, but straw buyers persist in states with looser 
gun regulations. 


Although the 
visibility of guns 
on campus may 
seem unique to 
this fall, they 
have never been 
far away. 


The walk to Shaw's takes many students past Kensington Street, 
Kensington Street, just four blocks behind Pierson and Daven-
pon Colleges, has long been a center for the city's inseparable drug and 
gun trades. Ho~ 
with boarded-up windows line both sides of the 
street; groups of young men stand in doorways and warily eye passing 
cars. As close as it is co campus, Kensington has not shared in the urban 
renaissance that won New Haven this year's All-American City award.
