**Good News: Public Access Cable Sweeps the Clouds Away**
**Author: Andrew Youn**

"Army Training Classics" is the best show on public 
access television. Airing Wednesday nights on channel 
29, it's essentially a broadcast of old War Department 
training films in grainy black and white, interspersed with 
ultra-militant soundbites. While watching on October 28, I 
learned how to crawl under barbed wire (on my back), how to 
cross an enemy trench (quickly); and why TNT is the armed 
forces' standard-issue explosive. 


Welcome to the Media Revolution. Along with MTV, CNN, and 
Lifetime, Yale students were plugged into three public television sta-
tions-27, 28, 29-as part of our cable package this year. At first 
glance, the stations seem to air only religious zealots, but looks can be . 
deceiving. 


Citizens Television, Inc. (CTV) is the non-profit provider of public 
access television to the greater New Haven area. Located far north on 
State Street, its unassuming storefront conceals a high-tech interior 
complete with four editing suites, a massive studio, and a Star Trek-like 
room with 20 VCRs stacked on top of one another. The acting execu-
tive director of CTV, James Martino, is something of a media fanatic. 
"Television is so central," he says. "It's everything in our society. I want 
to demystify it, to not understand it is dangerous. All sons of terrible, 
evil things can be done with television." 


These are strange words coming from a corporate type wearing a 
dress shirt, tie, and wire-rimmed glasses. But hold on-as the Brooks 
Brothers top gives way to youthful jeans and sneakers, Martino's enthu-
siasm for television becomes contagious. 


His vision for CTV comes out in lengthy bursts of verbiage. Com-
menting on Citizens Television before he took over, Martino says, "It 
wasn't in bad shape, but it was stagnant. Not moving. To me, that's 
bad. We were fulfilling all of our obligations, but not moving forward." 
He can hardly keep the disgust out of his voice. 


Martino has a long list of improvements in the works-a five-year 
,_ plan, if you will. The omnipresent shabby-looking rug seen on all of 
~ the studio shows will soon be phased out by a new generation of props. 
] As he hies his stride, Martino elaborates about his plans to advertise 
~ CTV on the Prevue Channel ("the only game in town"), build a second 
1 studio space, and improve production training to make the television 
~ shows look somewhat professional. 


There's certainly a lot of work to be done. Upon actually watching 
the shows on CTV, it might be tempting to conclude that, well, public 
access television just plain sucks. Religious groups, 
which take up more than half the programming time, 
range from over-zealous, heavy-jowled, sweaty local 
ministers to nationwide gloom-and-doom crack-pots 
with their own 800-numbers. A significant chunk of the 
remaining time is composed of what I like to call 
"endurance-television," such as hour-long interviews 
about nothing in particular with people talking very slowly. 


A personal favorite is a program that features a fixed camera showing 
the tops of people's heads in a NASA control room for hours on end. 


Most embarrassing for CTV is the question of how many people actu-
ally tune in, an issue that Martino awkwardly ducks (he'll get back to 
me on that). 


At the same time though, shows like "Army Training Classics" 
redeem CTV as a valuable enterprise-seriously. The non-commercial-
ism that makes CTV so lame is the same factor that makes the occa-
sional program so eclectic and amusing. It is gratifying to have an 
escape from a world of nano-second soundbites, stick-thin supermodels 
and catchy jingles. It is healthy to see ordinary, homely people on TV. 


For example, consider "Dolly Curtis Interviews," which features none 
other than Dolly herself (don't worry, I hadn't heard of her either), trav-
eling around Connecticut in search of local heroes. At least Dolly won't 
nauseate you with endless coverage of the Lewinsky a.ff.Ur or, to be hon-
est, Kosovo. 


Perhaps the show closest to my heart, though, is the brand-new 
"Today's Good News Show," whose selling line is: "No more bad 
news!" Noticeably absent from the inaugural show was any media 
hype, or the standard shooting-stabbing-sexual perversion story. 
Instead, the viewer is treated to a nice interview with a local couple who 
own a small business, while their little children run in and out of the 
picture. Then, a technical error caused the airing of a brief but informa-
tive video about the jellybean industry. The show rallied with a panel 
discussion featuring the mayors of West Haven, Hamden, and New 
Haven chatting pleasantly about "the issues" people claim to care 
about. The clincher: an interview with an endearing old man who was 
a torch-bearer in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. 


Maybe the CTV "Media Revolution" is not for everybody. But I 
think Sydney Evans, the producer of "Today's Good News Show," 
sums it up pretty well: "You see stereotype after stereotype on televi-
sion. What we're trying to do is bring out people's humanity."
