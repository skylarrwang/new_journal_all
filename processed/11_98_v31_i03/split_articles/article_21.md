**Title: The Omni and Local 217**

The Omni has refiled a previously with-
drawn case before the NLRB on behalf of its 
employees, alleging tjlat union organizers, like 
Martin, intimidated· other workers. Victory 
would annul the card count. Dan Abraham 
(SM '98), head of the Organizing Committee 
on which Martin serves, denies the charges 
emphatically. "We don't think we harassed or 
intimidated anyone," he said. Martin agrees. 
"I didn't threaten to beat anyone up," she said. 
The source of those charges is slimy, 
according to Pluecker. "When management 
was trying to find out if any workers had been 
harassed by the union, Paul Pinto and the 
main Omni corporate lawyer got a room at 
the hotel, got pizza delivered, got all these 
beverages and stuff, and then they called indi-
viduals from the restaurant and basically said, 
would you like some pizza, would you like a 
drink, and did the union harass you in any 
way?" Several workers, including Martin, con-
firmed that tete-a-tetes like this one-illegal 
by the terms of the neutrality agreement-have 
taken place, though no one testified to first 
harxi experience. 
Nevertheless, Local 217 has not filed a 
complaint before ~e NLRB. "It's in the inter-
est of the workers to make this as polite and 
non-confrontational as possible. Non-con-
frontational is the word of the day," said Mar-
tin. In other words, if the union is strong 
enough, legal recourse is unnecessary. Abra-
ham agrees. "If the union is strong, which I 
think ours is, they have to negotiate with us. 
But if they think were weak, then they'll 
fight." 
Right now, it's management that looks 
weak. Libby is gone, and the Omni is fighting 
Local 217 in court. If its case is dismissed, the 
union may begin contract negotiations three 
months from October 29, according to Abra-
ham. That's when the real rumble will proba-
bly begin. "The fight to get our first contract 
will be much harder than it will have been to 
gee union recognition," said Martin. 
One thing's for sure, though: Omni work-
ers are a long way from boiled frogs.
