early 200 physics students crowd the hall outside Davies
auditorium. A few walk quickly toward a wooden table,
and soon surround it. Others follow until they encircle the
students already at the table. Another ring of students
forms, then another and another. Those on the outside want to get to
the table so badly that they press against each other, forming a solid wall
around the table. By now those actually at the table are trapped by the
students around them. Confusion and anxiety build. Those on the out-
side examine the faces of those now forcing their way out. Some show
disappointment, some show relief, some laugh, and some show no
emotion at all. And those on the outside wonder what kind of face they
will be wearing when they get their tests back.

I am one of these students, but I will not get my test back today.
I'm learning disabled. Although the questions are the same and I'm
graded the same way as everyone else, my test is "different." While I
search again and again through the "A-to-C" stack of bluebooks, the
people behind me grumble and wonder what I'm doing. It seems that
my professor has misplaced my midterm. I am growing increasingly
anxious, but I cannot blame him; he did go out of his way to allow me
twice the normal time to take the test. Still, I can't help but feel some-
what like a second-class student. I woke up at 6:30 a.m. to hike up Sci-
ence Hill for this test, and now I'll have to jump through hoops to
remind my professor that I really did take the exam and that my blue-
book must exist somewhere.

I was born with dyslexia, a disability that affeets reading and
spelling. Although learning disabled students like myself receive special
treatment, we also have to make sacrifices, such as waking earlier than
everyone else to take a test and forfeiting extracurricular activities to
make time for our slowed reading and writing.

The hardest part of being dyslexic at Yale, however, is the general
ignorance that exists about the condition. Although many students
may have had some contact with a learning disabled person in the past,
the majority remain ignorant about learning disabilities. I confront
their misconceptions every day.

"Dyslexic" does not mean "blind." There is nothing wrong with my
eyes, and I don't see things backward. Yes, I can read a book upside
down, but you can, too, if you try. I have no problem telling my left
from my right, and I have never spelled anything backwards. But these
misunderstandings are minor compared to the belief that "learning dis-
ability" is synonymous with "incompetence." This misconception
occurs when others realize that I am different but can't quite tell how.
This uncertainty often leads to prejudice.

A learning disability is a condition that slows the acquisition of cer-
tain fundamental scholastic skills. In my case it simply means that I
read slowly, spell horribly, and have trouble with basic computations
like addition and subtraction. However, a learning disability in no way
affeets one's ability to think and reason. The majority of learning dis-
abled students have no trouble understanding elaborate concepts even
though they lack the ability to perform certain skills.

It may be said that those with learning disabilities have the body of
intelligence, but lack the hands and feet. Just as a physically handi-
capped person benefits from a prosthetic limb, those who are born with
a learning handicap benefit from special privi-
leges. These include extra time on tests and,
in some cases, a p~al waiver from the for-
eign language requirement. But compared to
some other universities-such as Brown,
which allows its learning disabled students
five years to graduate--Yale's approach to
learning disabilities is, to say the least, unac-
commodating.

That Yale would even accept a student
who has trouble with basic skills might seem
mysterious. Most people don't understand
that these skills are not actually required to
complete an Ivy League education. A learning
disabled student can perform at a level equal
or superior to other Yale students. Granted,
they must find alternative ways of learning
that compensate for the basic skills that they
lack. As my lab instructor put it, "Good
mathematicians don't bother with arith-
metic." Most students don't understand this
and ding to the belief that learning disabled
students somehow "snuck" into Yale by gain-
ing an unf.Ur advantage over other students-
"Anyone could have done well on the SATs if
they weren't timed." This common miscon-
ception leads to a feeling of distance that trou-
bles learning disabled people.

Distressing as they sometimes might be,
there are aspects of my disability that have led
to some rather comical circumstances. Last
summer I was traveling alone in Europe.
When I entered England, I was given a small
card to fill out explaining where I had been,
how long I was going to stay, and so on. Hav-
ing visited a few other countries, I had grown
accustomed to these little cards as something
to be disregarded. So I was very surprised
when two armed guards approached me while
I was waiting in line to leave the train station.
It seems that I had misspelled "Amerrica" on
the card; this error, in addition to the fact that
I had been traveling in Morocco during an
African bombing incident, made me suspect.
After a tense moment I was able to produce
my passport and share a laugh with the offi-
cial. Luckily I can reBect on such events with
humor; it allows me to appreciate that though
I might have to wait a few more days for my
tats to be graded, I will never be suspected of
international terrorism at Yale.
