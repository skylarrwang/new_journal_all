**Title: New Haven's Cultural Plan: Can the Arts Revitalize the City?**
**Page number(s): 27**

The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) opened in
downtown Newark in 1997. After the '67 riots and the white flight that
ensued, Newark became a crime-ridden and economically depressed
city. However, in its first year alone NJPAC sold 82 percent of its seats
to over half a million patrons. Its success sparked a surge of realtors
who were convinced of Newark's potential to buy downtown property.
These recent successes in Newark demonstrate that the arts can
improve the image and economy of a city. The Regional Cultural Plan
of Greater New Haven seeks to emulate the NJPAC with one difference--arts are already flourishing in New Haven. The greater New
Haven area boasts six symphony orchestras, two regional theaters, three
touring houses, five museums, and 5,000 individual artists, in addition
to Yale's four professional art schools. According to the Cultural Plan,
by supporting the already existing arts and marketing New Haven as an
arts community, the city will become the creative capital of Connecticut by the end of the decade.

The Cultural Plan arose from feelings within the arts community
that New Haven, and especially its businesses, didn't see the arts as central to the city. As in Newark, such cultural growth could spark economic growth. In 1996 the Arts Council of Greater New Haven, an
umbrella group for New Haven's arts community, hired the Woolf
Organization to perform a comprehensive study of New Haven's cultural assets. In June 1997 they finalized the report and drew up eight
strategies to encourage creative growth in New Haven. The report proposed improving 'the city's facilities, marketing New Haven as an arts
community, and stabilizing the finances of arts organizations. They
sought to further develop cultural services and resources, improve education and increase community solidarity through creative expression.

Now things are starting to happen. The state of Connecticut commissioned a $450,000 independent study of the city's arts facilities.
Also, the Coalition received an award of $300,000 through a matching
grant from The Community Foundation. In the first week of November, the Arts Coalition named Nan Birdwhistell (SOM '86) the Plan's
director.

The Cultural Plan is an expensive proposition, costing a projected
$1.6 million annually, plus capital investments. However, the plan is
unclear as to how much this investment will improve the city economically and socially. Money given to the arts might only improve the arts.
However, the plan's ultimate goal is an urban revitalization comparable
to Newark or Cleveland's Playhouse Square. Yet the plan never fully
explores the connection between the arts and the city's economy. While
claiming that "the impact of its cultural expenditures, already over $160
million annually in the nonprofit sector alone, will grow substantially,"
it never explicitly outlines what benefits the city could reap from
becoming the "creative capital" of Connecticut.

Originally, one of the major motives for commissioning the plan
was to find an effective way to market New Haven as an artistic community. The Arts Council has decided to suspend this initiative until
next year to address a more pressing financial issue. Thirty-two percent
of arts organizations are running deficits in the current fiscal year. Historically, the picture is even worse. In 1995 the city's arts organizations
ran a deficit totalling $2.5 million. Moreover, there is comparatively less
financial support for the arts in New Haven than in other cities. Sixty-
three percent of New Haven art institutions' budgets come from earned
income, compared to 39 percent in Charlotte and 57 percent in Houston (two other cities studied by the Woolf Organization). This can be
attributed to a relatively low rate of giving from both the private and
public sectors. The city contributes only six percent, and the state only
one percent, to the budget of New Haven art organizations. Unfortunately, local corporations have not picked up the slack.

These statistics, however, can be misleading. The numbers exclude
ad hoc giving from the city and state, like the funds for renovation of
the Shubert Theater and the revitalization of Audubon Court. Nevertheless, this trend of ad hoc giving puts the arts in a precarious situation. There is little or no steady source of funding. "This is one of the
greatest challenges to enacting the plan," says Frances Clark, Executive
Director of the Arts Council. She calls for additional funding for an arts
lottery like that used in Massachusetts, or a segment of the sales tax to
be set aside for the arts.

In order for the cultural plan to work, it needs the full support of
the community. Perhaps this is the greatest contradiction in the plan-
it relies on the financial aid of the city, the state, and local businesses,
but one of its primary goals is to foster private community support.
Essentially the Arts Council has to rely on an assumed level of support
to jumpstart its efforts. If support fails to snowball, however, the plan
may never be fully enacted.

Other challenges abound. The plan calls for arts organizations to
see themselves as a community, and not as competitors. "The biggest
challenge for enacting the Plan is getting people to make sacrifices for
the whole," says Clark. While the plan is only in its infancy, some
potential allies are unsure of their place in it. "I'm not clear of what my
role in the plan is ... I'm anxious to see how they include this office,"
says Lauren D'Alessandro, Director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs.
"The biggest obstacle is enacting the actual planning," says Mike
Morand (SY '87), vice president of the Office of New Haven Affairs.
The project is both enormous and costly, making the Arts Council self-
conscious about doing it correctly; if it doesn't act quickly, the community could easily grow wary of its efforts.

While few would ever deny the need for the arts, it is debatable
how many see them as the key to New Haven's future. Since nothing
has been enacted yet, there has been little opposition to the plan. This
makes it difficult to determine whether the plan will garner the support
it needs to turn greater New Haven into a creative and cultural center
for Connecticut, let alone whether it will lead to economic and social
revitalization.

Unlike other initiatives to improve the city, such as the renovation
of the Chapel Square Mall, the Cultural Plan relies not on a few individuals but on the entire community. Supporters' and skeptics agree
that a successful Cultural Plan would mark a new era in the history of a
troubled city.
