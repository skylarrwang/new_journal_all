William Costello III was always part of the legion of white, subur-
ban teens who drive up the price of Hilfiger stock and make it prof-
itable to produce rap albums. But starting last September, Will sacri-
ficed something a teenager actually cares about-sleep-to be part of 
urban culture. He wakes up at 5:30 every morning for an hour-long 
bus ride from Durham, Cf to New Haven's Wilbur Cross High 
School. The bus gets Will to school a half-hour before the morning rit-
ual of filing through the metal detectors begins. 

Will, a junior, is taking part in Project Choice, a program which 
provides state-financed busing for students adventurous enough to 
attend school outside their town and masochistic enough to wake up at 
5:30 a.m. It is one of several programs created by the state legislature in 
response to the Sheff v. O'Nal school desegregation case. According to 
the decision, Connecticut's racial demographics create de facto segrega-
tion in the public schools, which must be remedied by the legislature. 

Each district was asked to declare how many spaces it had available for 
out-of-district students. According to Peter Young, head of the Region-
al Educational Service Center, which oversees the finances and logistics 
of the busing, some suburban districts were honest, some were not. 

Still, the legislature is confident that it can force all districts to play the 
game, like it or not, once the Education Commissioner's report is 
released in January. 

Project Choice is one of two busing programs to come out of the 
State House in response to Sh4f The other bill opened Connecticut's 
tnagner schools to out-of-district students. Of the 500 suburban stu-
dents coming into New Haven, nearly all take part in this program. But 
with carefully sdeged student bodies and bundles of state aid, magnet 
schools have few of the problems associated with urban public educa-
tion. This year, New Haven's magnet Career High School moved into a 
brand new $30 million building near the Yale Medical School. Thirty 
nilllion dollars buys one hell of a natatorium. In addition, Career offers 
NOVEMBER JO, 1998 
seven Advanced Placement courses and boasts an internship program 
with Yale-New Haven Hospital. With these resources it is no wonder 
the school can woo more than a quarter of its students from out-of-dis-
trict. 

And woo is all urban districts can do. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme 
Court declared it unconstitutional to mandate desegregation busing 
across district lines. According to New Haven Representative Cam Sta-
l 
pies, head of the Education CornrrUttee in the State House, it was pop-
{ 
ular opinion, not the Supreme Court, that took forced busing off the 
~ 
table. "That method of desegregating schools has been discredited. No 
one in Hartford wanted forced busing," he said. Presumably none of 
"' 
the little people outside of the Belrway wanted it either. Without man-
dated busing, desegregation becomes reliant, in Staples' words, on 
" 
"marketing." 

But how could New Haven's regular comprehensive high schools 
ever compete with their well-funded counterparts in the suburbs? If this 
first year of Project Choice is any indication, not very well. This year, 
the program has opened up regular urban high schools in New Haven, 
Bridgeport, and Hartford to students from out of district. In Bridge-
port and Hartford not a single suburban student enrolled in the pro-
gram. In New Haven five did, one of whom was Will Costello. 

Will's decision to commute to Wilbur Cross each morning has 
made him something of a celebrity. He has been interviewed by The 
Boston Globe and The New York 1i1m. Yet, unlike the student integra-
tionists of the 1950s and '60s, Will did not intend his enrollment to 
make such a splash. He is no modern-day James Meredith. His decision 
to change high schools was more about education than the politics 
thereof, though like any left-leaning teen, he finds the pose of a civil 
rights crusader an alluring one. When I first asked Will about his deci-
sion to come to New Haven, he invoked the d-word-"diversity." His
