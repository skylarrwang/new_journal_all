"The University doesn't seem to care 
until it would be embarassing not to. 
Is a safe place to work too much to 
ask? --Anne Maginnis, Art Library 
staff meJI?.ber. 

"Yes, I'm bitter. I thought I might 
go blind. But we're starting to see 
things moue at last. "--Robert 
Kaufmann, Art Librarian. 

"I am an architect. (pause] I suppose 
I don't need to comment on these 
problems." -~Paul Rudolph, architect. 

In the Art & Architecture Building 
discontent has given way to a quiet 
sense of danger. Workers wearing 
masks and respirators will begin rip-
ping out the asbestos ceilings that 
have rained down fibers for a decade. 
The old orange rugs will be destroy-
ed. Each book in the basement li-
brary will be vacuum-cleaned and 
shuffled to the Cross Campus Li-
brary for the year. The building is 
not safe. 

To the users of the building, par-
ticularly the librarians, news of the 
hazards came as no surprise. That 
the University would try so hard to 
remove them did, however, and the 
story of that decision is complex. It 
involves a Yale doctor who was 
asked by superiors to "cease and 
desist" the investigation that actual-
ly brought the hazards to light. It 
involves university officials who 
knew remarkably little about a build-
ing that has plagued them from the 
day it opened. And it centers around 
the workers in the building and the 
years of complaints that seem now 
like a fever finally breaking. 

The story began in 1963 when Paul 
Rudolph, the architect of the A & A 
building, had asbestos blown onto .1 
some 70,000 square feet of ceiling 
during the final stages of construc-
tion. The snowy texture was quite 
fashionable then. That the ceilings 
had not been approved by the design 
committee did not matter, for as 
comment: Daniel Denton explores the perils of the Art and Architecture 
building; Emily Leamon takes a jaundiced look at the world's 
largest condensing mill.


Dean of the Architecture School Ru-
dolph enjoyed the double role of 
client and architect. Alvin Eisen-
man, a member of that committee, 
remembers Rudolph as "a very 
powerful man, a man who thought 
that middle class concerns like build-
ing codes were holding back his artis-
tic ambitions." Rudolph says he 
knew nothing of the dangers of the 
fiber then. "I liked the look of it," he 
says and has reportedly compared it 
to "clouds in the sky." 

By 1970 some states had out· 
lawed asbestos ceilings and the 
people upon whom Rudolph's clouds 
were raining began to worry. 

The University decided to remedy 
the problem by painting the asbestos 
with a latex sealer. This solution 
seems to have succeeded only in 
making the ceiling coarser and the 
fibers heavier--mor-e prone to fall. 

To the staff of the library the fee-
ble remedy was nothing new. It fit 
into a larger pattern of frustrations, 
of piecemeal attempts to make the 
building liveable. The water had 
never been good-·"lt was the color of 
chicken bullion," says Anne Magin-
nis, and the staff resorted to buying 
their own water. During the summer, 
librarians suffered nausea and head· 
aches, symptoms qf heat stress. Jn 
the winter, temperatures would reach 
ten degrees below the minimum estab-
lished by state law: 68 degrees. 

The University had been treating 
some of these inadequacies on the 
higher floors of the building. A mas-
sive fire in 1969 had provided the 
necessity and the means--$800,000 
insurance payment--for renovation, 
and a number of problems were cor-
rected in the process. The University 
spent at least another $200,000 in 
repairs on a building that, according 
to John Embersits, Director of Uru· 
versity Operations, "was not de-
signed with function in mind " 

·Conditions m the library impfoved 
little and the staff continued to send 
furious memoranda to the library 
administration. Eventuallv many 
resigned themselves to the tacts and 
learned to joke about the water and 
the heat and the falling dust. 

Then why the sudden barrage of 
relief for the library'! 

The impetus came from two men 
who possess strong doses of irrever· 
ence--Robert Kaufmann and Dr. 
Robert Sawyer, a physician at the 
Yale Health Servicesr. Kaufmann, in 
a!1 emotional way, and Sawyer in a 
scientific way, made the potential 
dangers of the building seem sud-
denly real. 

"I'm basically a pushy, bitchy 
New Yorker," says Kaufmann, "and 
I just didn't give up when I saw that 
my eyesight might be at stake." 

Kaufmann is actually a mild Ala-
baman who describes anger as "hav-
ing your ass on your shoulders." He 
has lately come to know the feeling 
well. 

Last July, Dr. Sawyer ordered 
Kaufmann to leave his library. An 
eye injury Kaufmann had received 
away from work was failing to heal, 
and he had begun to awake in the 
morning wjt;h his eye dry and pain-
ful. When h~ would open his eye the 
surface tissue of his eyelid would 
tear. Yale physicians examined his 
eyes and foqnd what they thought 
might be asbestos fibers. A biopsy 
sample was scraped from Kauf-
mann's eye and sent to New York's 
Mt. Sinai Hospital for electron mi· 
croscopy. No word has come yet, but 
if the.biopsy reveals asbestos Kauf-
mann may sue the University. 

Three other staff members have 
been experiencing conjunctivitis, an 
irritation of the mucous membrane of 
the eye. But since Kaufmann's prob· 
lem is more serious, they remain in 
the building. Kaufmann, who has 
been directing the staff by telephone, 
has visited only once since July--
wearing plastic goggles. 

" I'm sure they feel as if I've de-
serted them," says Kaufmann. Al· 
though Kaufmann's separation 
caused difficulties in communication 
throughout the summer, only after 
the University announced its plans 
did the anxiety of some staff mem· 
hers become intense. 

"The asbestos will be flying soon," 
says Sonja Bay, another librarian. 
"They expect us to go on working as 
usual--how naive can they be?" 

Kaufmann's misfortune became a 
graphic focus for the staff's discon-
tent, and it raised their complaints to 
a pitch that could not be ignored. 

But the main impetus for relief came 
on August 20 from Dr. Sawyer in a 
16-page report that did what should 
have been done long before--it fully 
documented the hazards of.the build· 
ing, cited the law, and made s~ific 
recommendations. 

"Very little was really known 
about the building," says Sawyer. 
"In view of all the complaints--if 
. they burned them they could heat 
1 
the building for the winter--the ignor-

ance was just astounding." 
The report made it clear that the 
University had violated state and 
federal laws protecting workers from 
asbestos exposure. It recommended 
the immediate removal of the asbes-
tos and other measures to make the 
building safe. 
Embersits denies that the Univer-
sity has violated any laws. He says 
that the University has taken action 
because of "growing concern" of the 
staff and the medical report. He 
points to the fact that the project 
was approved without any serious 
opposition from the staff in a meet-
ing on August 27. 
But the staff members do not agree. 
They have been working without any 
promises of compensation for the 
hazards they have faced. 
"We had no choice," says Magin-
nis. "We knew that they were going 
to do this eventually, we just hoped 
they would do it with more respect." 
The University has not decided 
whether or not to compensate the 
staff or to hire an outside agency 
to determine the full scope of health 
hazards. The decision to remove 
the asbestos and the rugs and to 
clean the library, a project of 
$100,000, may not satisfy the staff, 
particularly those who have suffered 
health problems. But to Kaufmann 
and others, the decision marks the 
end of a long battle, or at least the 
beginning of a new one.
