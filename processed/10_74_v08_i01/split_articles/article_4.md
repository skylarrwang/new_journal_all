**Blue Collar and the Old Blue**

Graduation at Yale is strictly an 
ivory tower affair, problems from the 
outside world are not supposed to 
intrude. But last May, in order to 
keep worldly problems apart from 
the commencement ceremonies, cam-
pus police were stationed at the gate-
ways to the Old Campus, and tarpau-
li.ns were draped over the fences. 
While proud parents watched sons 
and daughters receive Yale degrees, 
the chants of DON'T DICTATE! 
NEGOTIATE! intermingled with 
the solemn festivities. For the third 
time in as many contract negotia-
tions, the blue collar workers of 
Local35 engaged Yale University in 
a labor dispute--this one leading to a 
ten week walkout. 

The strike raised troubling ques-
tions about labor-management re-
lations at Yale. At issue was--and 
still is--Yale's priorities in allocating 
its financial resources. 

As the situation stands today, the 
1,100 workers of Local35 (Feder-
ation of University Employees, 
AFL-CIO, a local of The Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees Internation-
al) are back on the job. But there-
cent walkout only halted when both 
parties agreed to submit thirteen 
unresolved issues to an independent 
fact-finder, Eric Schmertz, who will 
present non-binding recommenda-
tions in mid-October to both parties. 
The dispute, therefore, is hardly 
resolved. Subsequent negotiations 
will follow Schmertz's recommen-
dations. But if bargaining does not 
lead to a settlement within twenty-
one days, or if either side refuses to 
extend negotiations, then the Union 
has the option to strike again. This 
means that by late November Yale 
may be without its workers and their 
services, and students may be forced 
to march down to McDonald's for 
their evening meals. 

And another strike may well be 
imminent. Although both sides em-
phasize the undesireability of a walk-
out, they are also quick to point to 
the present strike trend at Yale, 
which, they say, constitutes a pat-
tern difficult to break. Whatever the 
outcome of the labor-management 
dispute, the University's future will 
undoubtedly be affected. 

The 1974 dispute reflects the in-
creasingly polarized relations be-
tween the Union andY ale manage-
ment. This trend, dating from the 
mid-1960's, is suggested in a number 
of indicators. Before 1968, Local35 
had only struck once in its previous 
twenty-six years. Three consecutive 
strikes have followed. Also, accord-
ing to Leonard Marcus, Director of 
Employee Relations at Yale, Union 
members submitted very few formal 
written grievances for alleged man· 
agement contract violations before 
1967. Since then, the number of such 
grievances has steadily increased. 
Marcus suggests this is due to more 
aggressive supervision and better 
trained union stewards. 

Before 1966, the Union generally 
acquiesced to the offers of manage-
ment. According to Union leaders, 
Local 35 enjoyed a friendly rapport 
with Yale's former Personnel Direc-
tor, George Griswold. Acquiescence 
has now been transformed into bitter 
mistrust. The Union leadership sus· 
pects Yale management of trying to 
break the union and negate its effec· 
tiveness. 

On the other hand, representatives 
of management regard certain ac-
tions of Union leadership as amateur· 
ish. 

Several factors have caused this 
polarization in union-management 
relations. Inflation, for example, 
hurts Yale's ability to satisfy Union 
demands for higher wages. For the 
worker, inflation erodes compensa· 
tion increases negotiated in the past. 
A change of Yale's management 
team (and approach) in the mid-
sixties led to a more militant union-
and this made it more difficult for 
the two parties to get along. In the 
1940's, the Union was little more 
than a mechanism through which the 
University could impose contracts. 
This set-up generally continued in the 
50's & 60's. Although the wage levels 
were considerably below others in 
the New Haven labor market, the 
Union nevertheless acceded to the 
University's contract offers. Most 
employees worked a six day week in 
order to take home a moderate sal-
ary. 

Then, in 1966, Yale established a
