EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
But Douglas isn't really arguing a 
case. Though he presents the facts of 
the matter, he fails to direct them 
toward a final argument, or to draw 
any conclusions. He provides no in-
sight into himself, no glimpses of the 
inner principles by which he directs 
his life. His brief rambles, digresses, 
and moralizes--but it never con· 
eludes. 


The book shows, though, that 
Douglas has had ample opportunity 
for reflection. He frequently takes 
long, solitary walks in the woods. He 
prefaces his work by announcing 
that he has written the book in the 
spare time of the last 10 or 12 years. 
He must think deeply on the Court. 
He says, "writing an autobiography 
is, in a sense, giving a detailed ac· 
count of the slow, step-by-step edu· 
cation of the author." But where 
does he reveal the lessons? Clearly he 
is a deliberative man; just as clearly, 
he has omitted almost all reflection, 
all intellectualizing from his auto-
biography. 


Perhaps this is most disturbing: 
one expects Douglas to be a judge, 
but he comes off as merely an un· 
focused lawyer. One hopes for wis· 
dom, but Douglas offers only loose 
strings of anecdotes. 


Douglas's writing style is equally 
disturbing. His prose is flat and con· 
ventional, legal language at its dull-
est. He mars his narrative with 
homiletic conclusions, superficial 
remarks, and unimportant digres· 
sions. He allows himself gratuitous 
attacks on various "bad guys": John 
Foster Dulles, The Dodge Motor 
Corporation, and assorted Wall 
Street Lawyers. He seems to con· 
struct chapters by choosing titles 
and then multiplying anecdotes until 
he has filled up the "right" number 
of pages. Sometimes the anecdotes 
don't seem to follow any particular 
pattern: the idea occurs that one 
could shuffle the pages without 
knowing the difference. As a result, 
The Early Years is often painfully 
boring. 


Other times it is merely puzzling. 
Fly ELI! 


Douglas takes obvious delight in 
mocking "the Establishment." Yet 
Douglas has been a Supreme Court 
Justice for 35 years, was once a 
Securities and Exchange Commis· 
sion bureaucrat, and taught law at 
Yale. He confides that at one time he 
even had some support for a try at 
the Presidency. It is not easy to see 
how Douglas distinguishes himself 
from "the Establishment." 


One must also wonder how often 
Douglas suspends--or softens--his 
critical scrutiny when he is judging 
himself. How has he selected the 
material he presents? Has he left out 
those events or thoughts which con· 
flict with the philosophy he now 
holds? To what extent has his pres-
ent self-understanding shaped his 
interpretation of past events? Per-
haps, as Douglas suggests in a 
slightly different context, "my wish 
dictates my conclusion." Does Doug-
las project the present backwards 
onto the past? 


Questions of Douglas's narrative 
reliability aside, how can he--after an 
energetic, even important, life--
produce such a disappointing auto· 
biography? The Early Years is frus· 
trating because I find Douglas's 
public philosophy so attractive but 
see no deeper justification for his 
thoughts in his autobiography. In· 
stead, he distracts with the window 
dressing of anecdotes. He teases 
with glimpses of his feelings, but 
never reveals much more than the 
facade. 


Go East, Young Man is most frus· 
trating because it represents a squan-
dered opportunity. Douglas has con· 
sistently championed the interests 
and rights of the individual in a 
society increasingly threatened by 
the impersonality of massiveness. If 
only Douglas had focused on his own 
individuality, instead of the social 
environment in which he lived; if 
only his autobiography were as prob· 
ing as his judicial decisions. 


But better that he be a good judge 
and not a good writer than vice 
versa.O
