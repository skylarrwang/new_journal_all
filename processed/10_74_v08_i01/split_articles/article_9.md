Go East, Young Man 
The Early Years 
The Autobiography of 
William 0. Douglas 
Random House, New York 1974. $10 

This book is mistitled. That, un-
fortunately, is the least of its short-
comings. Douglas's autobiography 
seems to have sprung fully-typeset 
from his brow, without the interven-
ing aid of an editor or a second draft. 
The book is unfocused and super-
ficial; the writing is seldom inspired, 
usually insipid, and occasionally 
embarassing. A great man has pro-
duced a greatly disappointing book. 

In all fairness, William Orville 
Douglas did go East as a Young 
Man; he also went West. He first 
travelled West: three year old Bill 
moved from his Minnesota birth-
place to a Yakima, Washington 
home. In his early twenties, he jour-
neyed east to Columbia Law School. 
After graduation, however, here-
turned to practice law in Yakima. 
Since then, Douglas has alternated 
between W ashingtons, always con-
sidering "my own state of Washing-
ton to be my home," while writing 
treatises, lectures and judicial de-
cisions in the nation's capital. 

Douglas probably chose the title of 
his autobiography to emphasize the 
enormity of his eastward journey, 
and to reveal that fame and fortune 
have visited him only because he did 
go east as a young man. Douglas 
guesses that had he not left his child-
hood home, he might have by now 
risen to become principal of Yakima 
High. Yet he never tells us why he 
left. He asks rhetorically what could 
have made him, an unworldly coun-
try boy, leave secure Yakima f~r the 
uncertain world of New York C1ty 
and Columbia Law School. But he 
never stops to answer the question, 
never pauses long enough in the 
headlong description of his life to ex-
plain thE' first crucial choice he made. 

Douglas seldom pauses to probe 
any part of his life very deeply. A 
more accurate title for the book 
would be People, Places, and Ideas I 
Have Met: A Sprint Through His-
tory with William 0. Douglas. He 
herds a bewilderingly large cast of 
characters through his book. The 
reader barely has time to become 
acquainted with any of them, for 
another waits impatiently in the next 
paragraph. Places pass by more 
slowly than faces, but Douglas cir-
cumnavigates the world several 
times before the book is finished. He 
also introduces a number of his 
social, political, and judicial ideas, 
but the handshake has barely passed 
before he travels elsewhere to meet a 
new thought. 

Douglas admits that he has been 
extraordinarily busy throughout his 
life. In college, he studied and 
worked almost full-time (his mother 
counted on him, as the eldest son, to 
support the fatherless family). As a 
law student, he tutored, prepared 
materials for a correspondence 
course in law, and even managed to 
learn some law himself, although 
most of the last activity occurred, as 
he confides, "on the run." 

Douglas's autobiography is no less 
rapid. One cannot avoid thinking 
that he wrote the book "on the run" 
to convey the impression that his life 
was indeed active. It is as though he 
has accumulated anecdotes for 75 
years, and now spews them forth in a , 
great personal flood. Story follows 
story, case follows case, and person 
follows person, without respite, and 
often without apparent connection. 
People appear simply because he 
knew them, or because they were 
famous. In discussing the personal-
ities of the New Deal, Douglas says 
"Frances Perkins, Secretary of 
Labor from 1933 to 1945. should also 
be included." He does not include her 
because he knew her well (he devotes 
a scant four paragraphs to her) or 
because she played an important 
part in his life (he mentions her only 
two more times in the book). Rather, 
he felt she "should be" included be-
cause he was discussing New Deal-
ers. Perhaps Douglas wanted to ful-
fill some self-appointed role as New 
Deal chronicler. Others, however, 
have written about that period with 
sharper insight, greater breadth, and 
clearer vision. 

Unappointed but nonetheless 
undaunted, Douglas proliferates 
facts, faces, and thoughts. He re-
peats most of the important external 
events of his life: his education, his 
various jobs, his friends, and the out-
lines of his social philosophy--but he 
shows nothing of his feelings. He 
describes his first marriage in one 
paragraph, casually inserted be-
tween a summary of his earnings 
from tutoring and a short description 
of his election to the Columbia Law 
Review. 

At one point in the book, Douglas 
argues that "contests in the law 
should never be at the emotional, but 
only at the intellectual, level." Does 
Douglas consider The Early Years to 
be a legal brief in which he argues 
the facts of his life? He certainly does 
fill his book with facts. His may be 
the only autobiography which fre-
quently footnotes the Harvard Law 
Review and US Court Reporter.
