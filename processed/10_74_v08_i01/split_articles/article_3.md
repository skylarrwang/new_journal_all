and right away Playboy wants an 
interview, and then "Meet the 
. Press." A lovely irony, the govern-
ment gives you a platform by oppos-
ing you. 

On the other hand, you have to be 
very aware that what you say you 
don't just say to get the right on's. 
And writing about this period is 
going to be difficult. One of the 
reasons is that it's very painful. For 
instance, we didn't listen to each 
other. "Right On Right On" is not 
listening. And passion did distort 
judgement to an enormous degree. 
People, as I used to say, hated evil 
more than they loved the good, so 
they ended up damn good haters. 
The interesting thing is you really 
only find out how much you enjoyed 
it when you lose it. Where I used to 
go I'd get two or three thousand 
people out there. Now, no one has 
even heard of Coffin. That's good 
experience--I don't say I like it, but 
it's chastening. I don't think I ever 
had the problem of needing a public 
to maintain my identity. That was a 
problem in the peace movement. 
NJ: Did you ever feel trapped by 
your role? 
Coffin: I never thought I was 
under any pressure to say things I 
didn't want to say. It just so happen-
ed that what I wanted very much to 
say, other people wanted to hear 
said--they felt the same way. I felt 
that my primary role was raising to a 
conscious level the feelings that were 
inherent in thousands of people. In 
that sense there was a role to be 
played. 
NJ: Are you feeling too old for this 
sort of part today? 
Coffin: I turned fifty this year. My 
wife said to me you went from thirty-
five to eighty-five overnight. And 
you know, when you reach the age of 
fifty you don't have to become 
mellow, there's no single reason in 
the world for anyone to become

mellow. But you ought to become 
more compassionate and you ought 
to be able to distill from a lot of ex-
perience with a little more insight, a 
willingness to engage in subtlety. 
NJ: It's when your hair starts 
turning gray, you can sit back and 
reflect. 
Coffin: No, I'm not saying you sit 
back. I always felt there was a kind 
of rhythm, you see it in the New 
Testament. Jesus goes up on the 
mountain to pray, and then he's 
down in the valley to heal; he's back 
off by himself reflecting, and then 
he's in the Garden of Gethsemane 
getting arrested, and then he's hang-
ed in the most public place. But 
there's an engagement-detachment 
rhythm to life which I think does 
have to be maintained. If you don't 
pull out and reflect, you may simply 
be using action as an opiate instead 
of as a stimulant. 
NJ: Was your sabbatical largely 
that? 
Coffin: Oh yeah, I didn't do any-
thing active at all except play touch 
football. 
NJ: When you write a sermon for 
Chapel here--for instance your am-
nesty sermon--do you mean it to be 
religious or political? 
Coffin: I think there are non-
political dimensions to political 
issues, which are a religious concern. 
If you view amnesty as a political 
non-political dimensions of political 
issues. That's why Billy Graham is 
..,) 
not politically dangerous in the way 
. Jesus was. 
' 
NJ: You said once that Nixon 
used to surround himself with clergy-
men who were "house niggers." Is 
that the sort of thing you mean? 
Coffin: Yeah. Reverence for God 
entails a certain irreverence for hu-
man institutions, all human insti-
tutions, including especially the 
church. The faith gives you a sort of 
detachment. If you can say a mighty 
fortress is my God, and not a mighty 
fortress is my country, or my job, my 
reputation, my money, my family--
then you have a kind of freedom to 
be critical of all kinds of human insti-
tutions and actions. But if you get 
somebody in the White House like 
Rabbi Korff or this nut McGlaughlin 
who are simply sprinkling holy water 
on every kind of unholy thought and 
act--that's not religious. 
• ~ 
NJ: Even Billy Graham did that 
for a long time. 
Coffin: He did. You know it's 
funny, I wrote Billy Graham on 
amnesty. I thought I could persuade 
him that there was something in it 
for Mrs. Graham a.nd the kids, to put 
it cynically. 
NJ: Did he reply? 
Coffin: Yeah. I wrote him about 
how I applied the biblical text of the 
Year Jubilee to amnesty and he

life to an extraordinary degree. 
issue, purely as a political issue, then 
your definition is not adequate. It's 
a question of how justice is to be tem-
pered with mercy? Do all laws have 
to be enforced simply because people 
can't get away with anything? Is 
there such a thing as the bar of his-
tory--where God's judgement and 
society's judgement can take place? 
Now these are all sort of non-political 
dimensions of political issues. I think 
that's where the preacher comes in. 
Too many people like Billy Graham 
say politics is over here and religion 
is over there. Which is to 
the 
wrote back right away, saying he 
had never thought of it. Of course he 
wouldn't because he's a law and 
order man and doesn't understand 
grace. But we never got together. We 
had an appointment and then he had 
to break it, and then I went off to 
Hanoi and then I got a letter from 
his secretary saying Dr. Graham felt 
that perhaps we would both feel 
more free to talk after the election. 
So I wrote back and said I can't 
believe that Dr. Graham thinks poli-
tical considerations can dictate 
terms of interchange between two 
Christians. (laughs) I never heard 
from him again. 
NJ: Are you aware of the fact that 
many non-believers come to hear you 
preach in Batten Chapel? 
Coffin: In an academic community 
you're apt to have a lot of people who 
are far from willing to stand up and 
make a confession of faith, and that 
is right and proper. I think as long as 
one is asking the right questions one 
is already of the truth. 
NJ: Do you mold your sermons for 
the non-believer, who comes only to 
hear your political views?

Coffin: We have to be very cogni· 
:!\ zant of the fact that he doesn't feel 
' one excluded, because he's a non· 
believer. And one way you don't 
make him feel excluded is by addres· 
sing him in a language he will under· 
stand, with illustrations that won't 
put him off. I'm always puzzled 
when I drive around with the radio 
on in the car and I hear some of these 
religious programs. What the guy is 
actually saying I'm apt to believe 
just as much as be does, but some-
how the way it's coming out strikes 
me as unbelievably false. "Being 
washed in the blood of the lamb," 
let's take a phrase like that. Now 
that can move the hell out of me. But 
I would never use that phrase in 
Batten unless I explained it. That's 
the kind of response to the non· 
believer that's called for. Now if you 
get up and use straight religious Ian· 
guage and talk about Sin, Salvation, 
~" God, Jesus Christ, you can do it in 
such a way that people feel not only 
that you're not speaking to them, 
but you don't care about them. 
That's the problem with the God 
Squad here. Their use of language 
shows a remarkable absence of sensi· 
tivity. So there's certainly that type 
of consideration. 
NJ: Are you out to convert, too? 
Coffin: It would be selfish of me 
not to share that which means most. 
If the proper questions are being 
asked, and being asked with real per· 
sonal concern, then I'm doing my 
job. And I certainly don't worry that 
·<iod needs for his continued exis· 
tence my continued proof of it. Nor 
do I really think it is absolutely nee· 
essary that people believe in God. 
I had a very moving final talk with 
Norman Thomas just before he died--
he was on his deathbed, blind, arth· 
ritic, he could hardly move. And I 
asked him, I said Big Daddy do you 
believe in God? And he said, well, I 
don't believe in that all-loving and 
all-powerful God your uncle Henry 
and Emerson Fosworth used to teach 
us. This was at Union Theological 
Seminary. And I said, don't you 
believe that love is self restricting 
when it comes to power? And he 
said, yeah, I guess you can go a long 
way.with that. And I said let's face it 
Big Daddy, whether or not you be· 
lieve in God isn't really very impor· 
tant. What is important is whether 
God believes in you. And I am pre· 
pared to say quite dogmatically that 
you are his beloved servant. And he 
smiled, he was right at the threshold 
of death, and he smiled and said, you 
know, that made me feel good. 
(laughs) And I meant it too, I wasn't 
playing games with the old boy. I 
loved that man, he was a great man. 
And I meant that. 
NJ: Do you feel your place is at 
Yale? Why didn't you take the pos· 
ition the Institute for World Order 
offered you? 
Coffin: I trust instinct a lot. In· 
stinct didn't quite come through and 
say, you gotta go. That job was very 
tempting. This group is really com· 
mitted to a global future. In the next 
ten years people should be able to 
think globally. They came to me and 
said this is a religious vision isn't it? 
I said yes it is. Isn't it true that 
humankind is already unified by 
God? they asked. And I said, that's 
right. So what are you doing about 
it? I said, well, I try and preach it, 
and they said no, that's not enough. 
We want you to organize a whole reli· 
gious community in this country. We 
know that there must be conscious· 
ness raising and unless there's a 
spiritual dimension, a moral base·· 
broadly defined and generally accep· 
ted--then this movement is not going 
to get off the ground, and it probably 
won't anyway. But it's the right 
thing to do and that's why we're 
asking you to do it. That is a very 
powerful plea, you know, one that I 
couldn't help but respond to. I would 
like to think··at least for the time 
being--that I can do some of it and 
still remain at Yale. At Yale it's a 
terrible thing that we don't have a 
global studies program, that we still 
think in terms of international affairs 
instead of global affairs. Why is it 
that in order to feel in, we have to 
feel that somebody else is out? The 
faithful always need the infidel to 
confirm them in their fidelity. And 
Americans always need somebody 
over there to confirm them in their 
Americanism. Now if the guys from 
Mars would only--maybe we can just 
fake it a little and say they're coming 
from Mars-boy, then we'll have 
world unity like that. You can do 
that, I'm going to try and do that 
here; if you do it at Yale, maybe we 
can help other people do it a bit too. 
I don't like to give up the com· 
munity. Yale is home, and the 
church, I'm a churchman. I feel it 
very deeply, to have a church and be 
in a community, is something very 
important to me. 
NJ: But why here? 
Coffin: I still naively believe, 
maybe naively, that the saving rem· 
nant in this country is the univer· 
sity. I still believe in the education 
with a human face. The question is 
now do the humanities humanize? 
Do they always humanize or do they 
just neutralize? And since World 
War II we've known that people can 
bum Jews to death all day long in 
gas chambers and go home and read 
Rilke and listen to the Rasumowsky 
quartets of Beethoven. So we can't 
be that optimistic that education 
their knowledge and who know that 
loveless knowledge is ultimately triv· 
ial, certainly irrelevant. I think the 
faculty is a very repressed group, re-
pressed and oppressed. I've been 
here 16 years, and that question in 
really sharp focus form has never 
been raised for the university as a 
whole to confront. Do the humanities 
still humanize? 
NJ: It seems like a very commend· 
able goal, but how do you go about 
humanizing the humanities? 
Coffin: Well, first of all I think 
that when you get somebody who 
passionately believes in the serious· 
.ness of what he's teaching that it 
becomes a serious enterprise to ev· 
erybody else. That was Staughton 
Lynd's big gift. Everyone knew that 
Staughton was personally deeply 
committed to what he was teaching·· 
and didn't insist that everyone agree 
with his ideas, but that everybody 
I don't like to give up the community. Yale is 
home, and the church, well, I'm a churchman. 
makes people humanely literate. The 
fact is that the worst evils of the cen· 
tury have arisen in the most civilized 
country, in terms of the highest 
number of people at the universities. 
So you can't automatically assume 
anymore that education makes peo-
ple any more human. And there's 
lots of evidence that says it goes for 
gain rather than growth. I'd like to 
make that kind of fight here. There 
are enough professors here who 
really are deeply human, who love 
more or less agreed with his ques· 
tions, and come to their own personal 
kind of conclusions. 
There's also the question of what 
dimension you're going to teach. Are 
you going to teach Hawthorne with· 
out going into the problem of what's 
sin? You can. You can teach Dostoy· 
evsky and never really be changed 
by it, never even know that Raskol-
nikov was a heretic. I think the 
pressures on intellectuals are to be 
less intellectual and more scholarly,
