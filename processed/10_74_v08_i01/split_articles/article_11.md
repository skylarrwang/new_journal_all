ance seemed strange, especially at an 
institute of higher learning. My pur-
pose was not to find out why but to 
write an objective opinion of what 
the hell was going on in there.'' 


Sawyer decided that the earlier 
studies were useless, that they had 
measured the asbestos in quiet rooms 
and failed to appreciate just how 
people were actually exposed to it--in 
dusting, for example, where the 
worker breathes no direct fallout but 
stirs up tremendous concentrations 
of accumulated asbestos. Monitoring 
the workers as well as the rooms was 
a new idea, and Sawyer's superiors 
told him to "cease and desist." 


Sawyer went ahead with his study, 
nevertheless, and as the data ac-
cumulated, his colleagues started 
y changing their minds. "One of them 
put his hand to his head and said, 
'Oh my God, Bob, you're right!'" 


The report, in its own words, "con· 
tains few revelations." It does, how-
ever, show that the familiar prob-
lems can be cured only with a major 
commitment because they are inter-
related, and it puts those problems in 
the language of the law. It lists the 
violations--the poor water, the bird 
cadavers and animal life in the 
screenless building, the low temper-
atures, and the low railings and 
walls. The report concludes: "Per-
haps a reaffirmation of safety policy 
and responsibility is needed.'' 


I t appears that reaffirmation has 
begun. "Everything is clicking into 
place like dominoes now," says 
Sawyer, who continues to monitor 
the building and its renovation. He 
t carries with him electronic air sam-
plers, respirators and a camera, and 
he insists that he loves the building. 


For Kaufmann, "Things are going 
more smoothly now than ever before, 
our bitterness is paying off. The Uni· 
versity is worried." 


It is sad that the move has taken 
so long, that the private worries of 
some users of the building could end 
only when the public worries of the 
University began. And it could have 
taken longer. M. J. Costello, Busi-
ness Manager of the Schools of Art 
and Architecture and a member of 
the ad hoc committee that recom-
mended the action, "has mixed 
emotions about the decision." 


It will cause so many disrup-
tions," he says. "The University 
should have waited until next sum-
mer--they should have taught, no, 
they should have forced the people to 
live with the building another year. 
It's been 11 years, you know, and no 
one has died from it." 


No one knows what the building 
t. will look like when the library re-
turns there next summer. Many be-
_. 
lieve that the problems are so buiit 
into its contours that they will never 
be rooted out. Memory of the danger 
and the frustration will surely re· 
main. 


Nevertheless, a cautious optimism 
prevails. In the library it is a feeling 
that things can only get better. At 
the Health Services it is confidence 
that the tide has turned, that the 
University now has what Sawyer 
calls "a let's fix it frame of mind." 


And in John Embersits's office it is 
the tired hope that a year's hard 
work can "finally get that building 
off our back.''

**The Joy of Shrinking**
**Author: Emily Leamon**

In the climactic scene of The Loved 
One by Evelyn Waugh, the dis-
traught employee of a garish fun- · 
eral home finds that injecting her· · 
self with embalming fluid is.the 
best way of dealing with her con-
2 
fusion. Upon entering the well-
. 
manicured estate that The Read· 
er's Digest magazine calls home, I 
felt the same way.

Those who have read Waugh's 
novel will remember that music 
was cbntinuously piped throughout 
the grounds; so too at the eighty-
acre site in Pleasantville, New 
York1 where DeWitt and Lila Wal-
lace, the founders of Reader's 
Digest, have nestled the home of 
the world's largest selling maga-
zine. An oozing soporific that can 
best be described as religious 
Muzak emanates from the stra-
tegically placed " carillon::.," which 
sel the mood of the little corporate 
village. 


·'Ptctures from Pleasantvill~. " 
simpers a leaflet the tour ll"Uirle 
hands me The leaflet offer 'an 
armchair tour" of the Digest head-
quarters, of the authentic Modig-
lianis, Gauguins, and Van Goghs 
with which Lila W allac~·who also 
selects the Americana cover paint-
ing for every issue-· has adorned the 
premises. But the insidious and 
mind-deadening philosophy lurk-
ing in "the hallways must be dis-
covered in person. 


The appearance of the Digest's 
employees is curiously outmoded. 
Somber business attire is the order 
i of the day, with most of the women 
affecting a look somewhere be-
tween Peck & Peck and J. C. Pen-
ney. And women there are, but the 
tour guide admits they will be 
found mainly in typmg pools and 
at copy desks. The guide insists, 
however, that this is changing, 
slowly changing. Helen Hector, a 
senior editor whose mere seniority 
seems to have catapulted her to her 
nebulously defined heights, admon-
ishes me, ''Don't listen to them at 
those other places like Ms. (a gri-
mace here) when they tell you that 
women can't get anywhere at mag-
azines You can work within the 
system, you know." 


The philosophy that has raised 
The Reader's Digest Association, 
Inc. from a shoestring outfit in 
Greenwich Village to the multi· 
million-dollar corporation of today 
seems to be; "Ye shall inherit the 
earth if ye can condense it. "Al-
though the gains have not been 
fully reaped, the seeds are surely 
sown, and a vice president of the 
company explains how the foreign 
language editions of the Digest 
help "spread the word." I ask him 
what The Word is. 


''The Protestant work ethic," he 
says. ·patriotism, the belief that 
there 1s a solu tlon to every problem 
and that people want to know 
what the solution is." The vice 
president speaks of the De Witts 
and their philanthropy, and the 
Digest and its wealth, but his pride 
is laced with caution--for he may 
say nothing about the company 
that has not been printed in press 
releases or the papers. He is the 
voice of the Digest and he speaks in 
verbal reprints. 


The vice president nas opinions 
about other magazines, though, 
and he offers them generously. He 
explains that Life need not have 
folded had it only stuck with " vis-
ceral journalism," and not gotten 
into that "high-level •cultural non-
sense." 


An associate editor named Ric 
Cox, clean cut and about thirty, is 
presented to our group as the 
vouthful voice of ThP Reader's 
Digest. I ask him what goes on at 
Digest editorial planning sessions 
and he tells me that there are none. 


He speaks longingly of the day 
when a superior position at the 
Digest will afford him editorial 
power. If the Protestant ethic is the 
editorial Word, then Cox appears 
to be a lamb ready for the sacrifice. 
He condenses books and bides his 
time. 


"I don't particularly like to 
read," says Cox. "You take any 
novel, any article, anything, and 
you'd be surprised how much just 
isn't. necessary, how much you 
could do without." He particularly 
dislikes long descriptions. "Style is 
fine, but people would rather know 
just what happens. When I cut a 
book I try to sift out the extra-
neous scenes, descriptions, charac-
ters. and find the thread of action. 
This is what people want." 


The fervor with which the W al-
lace's digesting mill has recycled 
novels and magazine articles into 
tidy packages of prose seems to 
have overflowed into other parts of 
their lives. The tour guide shows us 
two lithographs that have been r~ 
produced from a tapestry and cut 
down to what Mrs. Wallace consid-
ers a manageable size--condensed, 
as it were. The guide also points to 
a Hepplewhite desk which was pur-
chased because it can be folded up 
for trips, nice and neat. I point out 
the emerging theme to the tour 
guide who laughs and mutters 
under her breath, "They condense 
your wages here. too." 


It is perhaps too easy to wax 
vituperative when speaking of The 
Reader's Digest; its please-every-
one format invites criticism. If 
more people sneer at this magazine 
than any other, it is also true that 
more find unabashed pleasure in its 
pages. So be it. The Word con-
tinues to creep across the globe--
drawing the dollars back to Pleas-
antville. 


The tour is over soon. Through-
out the group's brief look at the 
editorial offices we have been asked 
several times to be silent, PEOPLE 
ARE WORKING. There is no hub-
bub of voices at The Reader's 
Digest, no violent exchange of 
ideas. All business runs with order-
ly decorum. 


They do not worry at The Read-
er's Digest that when today's 
youth become tomorrow's middl~ 
aged the magazine will lose its 
readership. They assert that as 
people grow older they begin to 
"come into the fold," and there is 
an undertone of smugness in the 
assertion. 


As the bus pulls away from the 
ivy-covered building that resem-
bl~s a college more than a publish-
ing house, the thought occurs that 
the high-spirited Pegasus they 
have chosen for their logo is a less 
than apt symbol. Perhaps a bottle 
of Geritol.
