Â«William Sloane Coffin., Jr., Chap-
lain at Yale. Mailer had some re-
collection that Coffin had been 
arrested in the South on one civil 
rights affair or another, perhaps in 
Selma. The man was not unimpres-
sive at all; Mailer felt a dim in-
crease of cheer: our Yale Chaplain 
looked like a winner. " 
from The Armies of the Night, 
by Norman Mailer 

After a year long sabbatical in 
California, William Sloane Coffin 
is back at Yale--and back to stay. 
For Coffin it was more than a year 
of relaxation and reflection. It was a 
year in which J eb Magruder linked 
Coffin's name to the Watergate sce-
nario by claiming that Coffin (his 
former ethics teacher at Williams 
College) had broken the law dur-
ing peace demonstrations. Also last 
year, Douglas Dillon, the former 
Secretary of the Treasury, offered 
Coffin a full time position with the 
new Institute for World Order, an 
organization oriented toward a glob-
al future. He considered it seriously 
but refused. 

The following are largely unedited 
remarks from a casual conversation 
with William Sloane Coffin over 
lunch at Berkeley College. 

NJ: What's this about your 
writing an autobiography? Isn't that 
sort of an ego trip? 

Coffin: Well, that's what I 
thought. So I said to these several 
publishers who were nice enough to 
think I had something to say, why 
don't you publish my sermons, after 
all, that's my art form. They said, if 
you insist we will. We'd rather do 
that secondly, we want your auto-
biography. I said that's kind of pre-
sumptions isn't it? I'm not even fifty 
and I'm to write an autobiography as 
if my life is some kind of Norman 
Mailer litmus paper through which 
everything that is past can come out 
with enormous interest? They said if 
you want to wait until you're senile 
and write something sentimental, 
feel free. But we kind of hoped you'd 
write something tough minded that 
talked a lot about your failures. I got 
sort of intrigued by that. I began to 
see that an honest account of how it 
was with me--with the implication 
being how was it with you-could be a 
useful book for others, as well as un-
doubtedly a wicked form of therapy 
for myself. 

NJ: Might it tum out to be just 
another Magruder book? 

Coffin: I tell you, my wife and I 
made the appointment with Ma-
gruder to meet the head of A then-
eum. A kind of ornery instinct of 
mine said, if Magruder can write a 
book, then dammit, Coffin, (laughs) 
so can you, and have something 
more to say. 

NJ: You mentioned in your review 
of Magruder's book in Harpers that 
his writing did not mean as much to 
Magruder as it should have--that it 
might have been just another PR 
stunt. How will yours be different 
from that? 

Coffin: I think Jeb, as I said, 
wrote too fast. It was ghost written 
and he had to get it done before he 
went to jail to get that money for his 
family and all. I'm not under that 
same pressure. So I hope I '11 take a 
little more time on some of the more 
difficult problems. For instance, 
what does public life do to your pri-
vate life? And have I engaged in 
action as an opiate or as a stimulant? 
I'm not saying it's a deeply intro-
spective book, but I'm going to try 
and write about things--well, I have a 
hard time still talking about it, be-
cause I'm still a little embarassed by 
it. I think that the more personal the 
book is, the better it's going to be. 
For instance, born a WASP in New 
York, I know that in my upbringing 
correctness in behaviour won out 
over honesty of feeling. But I can be 
very specific about what feelings 
were repressed. And what about the 
return of the repressed, did it come 
back? Music was a big thing in my 
life, it was the only place where I was 
really free to express all my emo-
tions. I wanted to be a concert 
pianist. So, there's that kind of 
thing. My hope in dealing with civil 
rights and the anti-war movement in 
the book is to do it rather pastorally, 
not just as a chronicle of events. 

NJ: What sort of change did come 
over you when you became an Amer-
ican folk hero? Towards the end of 
the sixties, students would write 
things like this, from the University of 
Michigan, "Combining his compas-
sion with his energy and unrelenting 
faith and conviction, he is the im-
petus for the movement to continue. 
We don't need a lot of Reverend 
Coffins. But we do need at least 
one." Etc. Etc. 

Coffin: Go right ahead. (laughs) 

NJ: Did you feel comfortable 
underallthatadulation? 

Coffin: Well, if you don't inhale, I 
always figured it wasn't too danger-
ous. No, I enjoy 3000 people coming 
out to hear what I have to say if 
what I have to say is important to 
me to say it. No, I have not suffered 
from a shrinking ego, I know that 
perfectly well. But that's the kind of 
thing that's good to write about. I 
thought at the time, one, that I 
enjoyed it; and two, that I was grate-
ful to the government for giving me 
that platform. See, you ~~_indicted,
