new Department of Personnel to co-
ordinate personnel functions and 
introduce modem management pro-
grams. Leonard Marcus, a labor re-
lations professional who worked for 
the Inland Steel Company, was offer-
ed the job of modernizing Yale's 
personnel programs. John Ember-
sits, a former Yale footbal captain 
and also a veteran of Inland Steel, 
became the University's Director of 
Business Operations. Together, they 
introduced a new management con-
cept to increase efficiency and insti-
tute reforms--"professionalizing" 
Yale's style as an employer. Imme-
diately, Marcus asked the Yale Cor-
poration to approve pay rates com-
petitive with the New Haven labor 
market and a reduction in work hours 
as well. This was done to attract and 
keep competent employees who 
would improve the quality of Yale's 
work force and decrease the costly 
need for sub-contracting. Other 
changes were also made. Through 
negotiations all jobs were divided 
into seventeen labor grades with pre-
scribed bidding procedures for job 
changes. Management cracked down 
on alleged sick leave abuses. Promo-
tions became based on ability as well 
as seniority. Improved job security 
provisions were also negotiated. 

With the advent of new manage-
ment at Yale, the union membership 
perceived that they had an oppor-
tunity to gain long-needed improve-
ments in wages and working con-
ditions--but that they would have to 
take a tougher stand to get them. In 
1968, caught between craftsmen 
dissatisfied with wages and unskilled 
workers who wanted to keep up with 
their skilled fellow-workers, the un-
aggressive Union leadership reluc-
tantly called a strike. 

But the Union was not yet strong. 
During the 1968 strike, Vincent Sira-
bella, then head ofLocal217F and 
Director of the New Haven Central 
Labor Council, acted as a mediator. 
and saw the union settle for what he 
considered a "sweet-heart" contract. In 1969, the rank and file asked Sira-
bella to become full-time business 
agent of Local35. 

Believing that the working man, 
trapped in a class system, could only 
improve his condition through the 
labor movement, Sirabella was deter-
mined to build a strong union. 
Strength, he felt, would both counter 
the formidability of management 
and force Yale to fulfill his vision of 
the university's social responsibility 
to New Haven. 1971 marked a significant step for-
ward for Sirabella and the Union. 
When the issue of a possible bursary 
student threat to Union jobs arose, 
Sirabella led a strike. The Union won 
important contract improvements in-
cluding guaranteed limitations on 
student employment and significant 
wage increases for the unskilled 
workers deprived in the 1968 settle-
ment. But more important, the strike 
effected an unprecedented degree of 
Union solidarity over the job secur-
ity issue. Union strength continued 
to increase; by 1974 Local 35 was 
able to confront management direct-
ly over major financial issues while 
uniformly resisting its efforts to per-
suade workers not to support the 
strike. 

Another factor that has led to 
polarized labor-management rela-
tions is the clash of the personal 
styles of the two leaders. The 
"professional" Marcus, pedigreed by his 
long association with Yale, and the "char-
ismatic" Sirabella, dedicated to com-
batting the establishment, do not, to 
put it mildly, get along. Marcus 
employs formal argument, formu-
lated procedure, and tough bargain-
ing table techniques; Sirabella tries 
to use the anti-Yale emotions of New 
Havenites, and the political forces at 
Yale (students, faculty, Administra-
tion, and white-collar workers) to 
exert pressure against the Univer-
sity. Marcus is irritated by Sira-
bella's flamboyant politicking; Sira-
bella sees Marcus as an insensitive 
manager who suffers from a desire 
for overkill. Sirabella also regards 
Marcus's professional techniques as 
attempts at clever manipulation and 
deception. 

This clash in personal style may 
hinder progress at the bargaining 
table where the two square off. In 
1974, what Marcus regarded as pro-
fessional bargaining techniques Sira-
bella viewed as calculated efforts to 
impose a contract on the Union. 
From Sirabella's vantage point, 
Marcus tried to maximize his posi-
tion by forcing the union to consider 
the University's proposals before 
even beginning discussion of the 
Union's demands. Marcus maintains 
that both sides had "equal time" at 
the bargaining table. 

These differences in fundamental 
perspective often lead to complicated 
communications. Sensitive to pos-
sible union-breaking tactics, the 
Union's negotiating team thought 
Yale tried to dictate a contract that 
would not only have negated some 
provisions in the 1971 contract, but 
would also have pitted incumbent 
workers against new employees. At 
the twelfth hour, Yale offered to re-
allocate the fixed sum in its overall 
proposal-an offer regarded by the 
Union's negotiating committee as an 
attempt to "buy them off" at the 
expense of the rank and file. 

From labor's position, strikes de-
mand a significant sacrifice by the 
low-paid worker, particularly the un-
skilled ones who cannot easily find 
alternative employment. For Yale, 
strikes cause disruptions in the work 
of the university and tie up resources 
for long periods to resolve the dis-
pute and mitigate its effects. Strikes 
also lead to bad relations between 
Yale and its workers, and Yale and 
the community. 

Representatives of the University 
suggest that a formula for automat-
ically submitting labor disputes to 
compulsory arbitration might be 
necessary in the future. Binding arbi-
tration presents certain problems. 
For one, it might make labor rela-
tions at Yale more formal, already a 
primary cause of their polarization. 
And such a formula might confront 
Yale with legal problems which 
would result from having an outside 
party determine how Yale is to use 
its funds. 

Sirabella insists that the Univer-
sity first communicate its acceptance 
and respect for a strong union before 
a working relationship can be estab-
lished between the two parties. He 
does not respond positively to com-
pulsory arbitration, perhaps fearing 
the union may lose its right to strike. 

To alleviate tensions, one observer 
in the 1974 negotiations suggested 
that Yale make a thorough publica-
tion of its finances. This would en-
able the Union to make demands 
with a definite sense of Yale's capac-
ity to pay, while also reassuring the 
workers that Yale has an important 
place for them on its list of priorities. 

More important than the state of 
union-management relations in the 
1974 dispute are the hard financial 
issues involved. The strike reveals a 
classic confrontation between an 
employer trying to maintain the 
status quo in the face of rising costs 
and dwindling assets (i.e. by preserv-
ing priorities and a balanced budget), 
and a union militantly striving to 
improve the economic position of its 
members in the face of overwhelming 
inflation. Of the thirteen unresolved 
issues, six are purely financial in 
nature. Three of these have proved 
the most troublesome. One involves 
the University's wage rates. Anoth-
er, the cost of living adjustment for-
mula (which is designed to protect 
wages against the effects of infla-
tion). The third deals with the degree 
and distribution of the University's 
payment of employee health insur-
ance. 

According to the University's fig-
ures, the union's proposals would 
increase Yale's costs by $10.5 million 
over the next three years, while 
Yale's offer would necessitate an 
increase of $5.2 million. The gap re-
flects the different priorities estab-
lished by each party in determining 
its position. 

The University asserts that in 
the current period of inflation, 
Yale can only pay its non-academic 
employees a competitive wage equiv-
alent to the going rate in the New 
Haven labor market and the private 
university industry. According to 
Yale authorities, a more generous 
offer would force the University to 
compromise its educational priorities 
by either short-changing the academ-
ic budget or dipping into the endow-
ment fund, an important source of 
security and income. They maintain 
that Yale, as a charitable corporation 
restricted by charter provisions to 
purposes of scholarship, can only 
justify non-academic payrolls as 
they contribute to the academic en-
terprise. 

Despite its distinction between 
academic and non-academic payrolls, 
Yale maintains that it does not em-
ploy the competitive market stan-
dard to discriminate against its blue 
collar workers. The same standard 
applies to faculty and administration 
salaries, tuition Levels, and scholar-
ships. But University officials at the 
same time point out that its academ-
ic programs have suffered because of 
finances, and that faculty and stu-
dents must come first in an economic 
pinch. To further indicate its lack of 
discrimination against the workers, 
the University contends that while 
faculty salaries have lagged behind 
inflation, the blue-collar workers 
have stayed ahead of cost of living 
increases. 

But the Union adheres to a differ-
ent set of priorities--it wants a "social 
wage." The Union insists that Yale 
meet the needs of its workers and 
lead the labor market in both wages 
and fringe benefits. Union leaders 
believe that as a well-endowed insti-
tution, exempt from taxation, and 
remarkably successful in balancing 
its budget during inflationary times, 
Yale could pay the workers more if it 
so chose. Union leaders say that Yale 
not only has the capacity to pay 
more, but that it should do so. They 
cite Yale as New Haven's largest and 
wealthiest employer. As such, Yale 
should fulfill its social responsibility 
to the city by paying its workers 
what they consider a decent wage. 

Sirabella feels that the University is 
The New Journal/ October 1, 1974 /8 
hypocritical in not living up to its 
liberal rhetoric. The Union leader-
ship thinks Yale's claim that it can-
not pay more indicates a lack of con-
cern for its workers. 

Using the social standard to deter-
mine wages would help the low-paid 
worker hit hardest by inflation. It 
would enable Yale to practice its 
professed humanitarian concerns by 
aiding its own workers. Finally, it 
would render irrelevant the Univer-
sity's distinction between academic 
and non-academic remuneration, 
while also indicating Yale's recog-
nition that the workers--as contrib-
utors to the Yale community--have a 
right to fulfill their basic needs. 

The University's argument that a 
social wage would be difficult to 
quantify does not provide sufficient 
grounds for rejecting the concept. 
The social standard could be ascer-
tained by answering a few basic 
questions. For instance, what items 
constitute the worker's basic needs? 
Should family size or the compos-
ition of the family be considered? 
Should considered income derive 
only from earnings from one employ-
er or from all financial sources? 
Should computed income include 
both fringe benefits and incentive 
pay? Should wage increases be re-
lated to jobs performed or should 
they vary with the number of depen-
dents of individual employees? Des-
pite their perplexing nature, these 
questions invite response. 

But the issue of the social stan-
dard runs up against both cold fi-
nances and Yale's own philosophy. 
According to Yale, the University 
has been operating at an overall defi-
cit despite austerity measures that 
have reduced faculty positions by 
541 over the past three years. Yale 
maintains that it simply does not 
have the immediate sources of in-
come to pay the union's social stan-
dard. 

A principle source of Yale's in-
come, the endowment, has become 
significantly devalued due to the 
economic situation, and an increase 
in dividends from it is nowhere in 
sight. Stanley Flink, Yale's Director 
of Public Information, points out 
that Yale cannot sell portions of the 
endowment to pay its workers be-
cause the use of its funds is restricted 
by law to educational purposes. As 
for private gifts and government 
grants, these are given for specific 
purposes and cannot be used directly 
for workers' benefits. 

Furthermore, according to Yale, 
tuition (another major source of in-
come) is already the highest in the 
country. It would not be practical 
to impose an additional burden on 
students and parents already suffer-
ing from inflation-a burden that 
might prevent some candidates from 
entering the University. Yale claims 
that disadvantaged students have as 
much right to financial assistance as 
the workers have to higher wages. 

As Yale sees it, then, the payment 
of a social wage to its workers might 
involve a grim choice between cut-
ting back its academic budget and 
decreasing its services by reducing 
the number of workers. 

Yale's payment of what it consid-
ers to be a competitive wage would 
enable it to avoid this agonizing 
question and perhaps a more troub-
ling underlying one: should it re-
orient its financial priorities, or sacri-
fice its workers? In other words, 
should it continue to be an academic 
institution that places quality schol-
arship and formal education first, or 
should it become a more socially 
oriented employer? 

The future of labor-management 
relations at Yale may hinge on the 
answer to this question, and may 
well involve a new or at least clearer 
definition of the University's goals. 0
