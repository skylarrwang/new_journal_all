Finding the Fluid Middle 
by Carla Solomon and Stephen Sternbach 
Student-to-Student Counseling. It's 
a term some of us have heard for four 
years now, and this fall it has come 
again-in the crop of yellow posters 
and on the mimeographed sheets in 
the registration packets. And again 
it has succeeded less in attracting 
counselees than in raising a cloud of 
questions. Who is behind the ser-
vice? How did they get there? What 
can they do? 

After four years of Student-to-
Student Counseling's existence the 
time has come to face other ques-
tions that hinge on a simple fact: 
while subscription to the service 
increases each year, sse has never 
really been popular. What is more, 
while students on campus gener-
ally feel there is a need for such a 
service, several counselors feel that 
sse will fold if it fails to take firm 
roots this year. 

Five nights a week a rotating, 
male-female pair counsels any stu-
dent who chooses to walk through 
the doors of the Yale Health Ser-
vice. A night seldom brings more 
than one visit, and often no one 
comes. 

One reason for the service's lack 
of popularity is also one of its 
virtues--confidentiality. For just as 
counselors never discuss the cases, 
counselees rarely talk about the 
service. But last year only about 
thirty students used sse, and this 
statistic clearly points to other fac-
tors that may say something about 
life at Yale: mistrust of a service 
that is run by other Yale students 
and the fear of admitting weakness 
and vulnerability to anyone. At 
least these are the concerns of 
those students and advisors in-
volved with sse--concerns that in 
this crucial year of its short history 
deserve a closer look. 

Begun in the fall of 1971 as an 
outgrowth of the human sexuality 
course given by Dr. and Mrs. 
Philip Sarrel, SSC viewed itself as 
a sexual information and counsel-
ing service. But its scope soon 
broadened. "We soon realized that 
we were talking about more than 
an information service,'' says Caro-
lyn Grillo, one of the founders. "We 
realized that it was turning into a 
sexual and social counseling organ-
ization." 

It has maintained that dual pur-
pose over the last three years. sse 
provides straightforward sexual in-
formation about contraception, 
VD, abortion and related problems. 
And it attempts, by offering coun-
selors who have had experiences 
similar to the counselees, to allow 
the student to get a better perspec-
tive on the social tensions that the 
Yale environment creates. sse 
seems to cast itself in the role of the 
empathetic but detached room-
mate, while professing to be more 
than that. 

Why another counseling service? 
Yale has the oldest mental health 
program of any educational institu-
tion in the country, and it has 
always been used to full capacity. 
Some 900 students a year come for 
psychiatric care, and though the 
waiting list is long, each student is 
entitled to at least a semester of 
free help. Dr. Ernst Prelinger, a 
clinical psychologist at the health 
service and advisor to sse, thinks 
the overload is only natural for a 
group of students "highly selected 
on intellectual grounds but not on 
emotional ones." 

"Yale is a very hierarchical es-
tablishment," says Phil Zaeder, 
Associate Chaplain of Yale and 
another advisor to sse. "and often 
it offers fixed extremes that cannot 
be adapted to every situation. If a 
person has a problem here, he can 
either talk to friends or see a psy-
chiatrist, and despite the many 
people who use the psychiatric ser-
vices and the many who discuss 
problems with their friends, both 
alternatives are unacceptable to 
some.'' 

Zaeder sees a need for a service 
somewhere in between the two, a 
kind of middle ground that pro-
vides neither friends nor total 
strangers, neither professional an-
alysts nor unskilled listeners. This 
is Zaeder's conception of SSC's 
role, and he calls it the "fluid 
middle." 

"Sometimes it's very difficult 
to find the intimate stranger," he 
says. "We need trust more than a 
friend. We build up a trust and 
endow it to the intimate stranger, 
who becomes a relief from the trial 
motif which is very strong at Yale; 
sometimes it's good to go to a place 
where we're not on trial-not being 
judged. Often a friend cannot pro-
vide this and student counseling 
can." 

"Intimate stranger." "Fluid 
middle." The words themselves are 
vague, and the functions they 
name are just as hard to pin down, 
the boundaries just as loose. While
