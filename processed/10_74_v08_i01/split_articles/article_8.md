**Title: The Student Counseling Service at Yale**

the service tries to play more than 
the role of a friend, it is emphati-
cally not an attempt at in-depth 
psychiatry. When a problem seems 
to exceed the scope of social coun· 
seling--and this decision might 
vary with each counseling team·· 
the team refers the problem to one 
of the staff advisors. 

An example. A freshman woman 
from a strict Catholic family where 
any discussion of sex was taboo 
coines to Yale expecting an active 
social life. She finds that boys are 
not asking her out formally, and 
she doesn't know how to respond to 
"just talking" or going to the 
movies. She becomes more and more 
withdrawn and confides only in 
her roommate, who becomes in· 
creasingly demonstrative in her 
affections. 

She realizes she is being seduced. 
Confronted by a problem her pre-
vious experience has left her un-
prepared for, she is too embarassed 
to tell her freshman counselor and 
too frightened to see a psychiatrist. 

As an aJternative, she goes to SSC. 
The counselors decided that the 
problem was beyond their scope, and 
they told the girl. But it did not 
end there--the counselors convmced 
the girl that she should consult 
someone at the psychiatric service, 
and they helped her set up an 
appointment. They offered no solu· 
tion, but simply eased the trepida-
tion that the girl felt toward 
psychiatrists--the common fear of 
being classified as "sick," and the 
fear that records of treatment will 
jeopardize a career. sse could not 
res9lve the problem and did not 
presume to, it simply referred it to 
a better source. 

But there are problems that SSC 
does think it can handle--problems, 
for instance, of facing the aoademic 
and social pressures of Yale, of re-
lating to people, of making friends, 
of the male student lonely on week-
ends and depressed at mixers, of 
the female student unable to deal 
with a new influx of sexual pres· 
sure, or of the couple not able to 
assimilate changes in the relation-
ship. "We're not a psychiatric ser· 
vice," says Miriam Wimpfheimer, 
co-director of SSC this year. "But 
we're not just sounding boards-
either." And Steve Sternbach, the 
other co-director, puts it this way: 
"The counselors are trained and 
most of us have had experience in 
dealing with these kinds of prob· 
lems--and more severe ones··before. 
If we can't do better than the 
average person off the street, then 
we're useless. But we can do better. 
We know what 1ssues to raise, what 
questions to ask, what to point out, 
ho\\ to build up trust."' 

A fine line, however, exists be 
tween this degree of investigation 
and the irresponsible excesses of 
the " arm charr psychiatrist. •· In 
choosmg to walk this line, the 
counselors and advisors must be 
aware of its dangers. During the 
training sessions, in fact t.hey dis-
cuss the differences between coun· 
seling and psychotherapy. 

"I have no obJection to a coun· 
selor investigating a person's 
past," says Prelinger, "if that past 
has a bearing on the present prob-

lem. I am, however, against a coun-
selor who ettempts to explain a 
person's life." In the terminology 
of psychotherapeutic techniques, 
what the student counselor does 
would be described as "suppor-
tive." Prelinger described the sup-
portive role as "an effort to help 
somebody cope with acute stress 
by strengthening resources heal-
ready has." 

But beyond the label and beyond 
what the advisors think the service 
should be, it is the competence of 
the counselors themselves that de-
termines what sse actually can do. 
The initial training sessions for 
counselors involved role-playing 
exercises designed to elicit the 
sensitivity the counselor will need 
and to give him a sense of the ap-
proaches he can use. One student 
plays counselor and another plays 
counselee while a psychiatrist 
supervises and the other prospec-
tive counselors watch and criticize. 
The scenes serve as dry runs and 
are intended to help make the real 
dialogues as fruitful as possible. 
But even for those students chosen 
to counsel, that dialogue rarely 
comes. Their night at the health 
service is more often than not a 
night to get some reading done. 

Why the poor response? It may 
be that Yale has no use for the ser-
vice, that undergraduate life is too 
fragmented for students to feel 
that a stranger has anything to 
offer. It may be that Yale has no 
uniting force greater than its aca-
demic pressure. Indeed, the library 
is the closest Yale comes to offering 
a social center for undergraduates, 
and it is perhaps symbolic that 
when sse thought of changing 
locations, one of the few places it 
seriously considered was the Cross 
Campus Library. 

Most minority groups on cam-
pus have a stronger sense of com-
munity than the students at large, 
and it is to these groups that 
minority students usually look for 
guidance. Chris Waterman, one of 
the directors of sse last year, 
cannot remember ever having 
counseled a black or Chicano. As 
Phil Zaeder puts it, " If you're 
given a name, you want to feel com-
fortable with others of the same 
name.'' 

According to Zaeder, the causes 
for the difficulties of sse go deeper 
than this. He believes that the 
"achievement ethic"-the tendency 
for students to define themselves 
by their achievements--is so strong 
here that students dislike admit-
ting failure to each other. Seeking 
help from a student counselor 
seems to imply incompetency or a 
kind of inferiority. The achieve-
ment orientation Zaeder mentions 
is a double-edged sword, at once 
causing anxiety and sealing off the 
way ~find relief. 

'' 'Yalies are threatened by the prospect of 
another student who assumes greater 
knowledge.' '' 

"Yalies are threatened by the 
prospect of another student who 
assumes greater knowledge,'' says 
Reb McMichael, a former counsel-
or, "and they fear admitting that 
another student, and not a profes-
sional, could handle a problem 
better than he or a friend could. For 
a Y alie to go to a student-run ser-
vice means that he needs it--and 
it's hard for a Yalie to admit that 
he needs anything." 

What the counselors hope, a.nd 
what Zaeder predicts, is that the 
achievement ethic will be super-
ceded by a more basic human 
need-the need to express oneself. 
" We have a need to be more than 
episodic," Zaeder says. "We have 
to share with someone our whole 
story, to be creative and have 
people listen. We want a chance to 
account for where we have come 
from, what we're doing, and where 
we're going." 

Zaeder questions the traditional 
Freudian notion that intellectual 
insight and a detached analyst pro-
vide the only route to a more posi-
tive emotional state. He thinks 
that sse can work and that it can 
fill a void left by the decline of 
religious counseling. And like 
everyone involved with the service, 
he predicts success. 

"Student counseling is the sort 
of thing you have to build a trust 
in," says Dr. Robert Arnstein, 
head of the mental hygiene depart-
ment at the health service and 
advisor to SSC. " I spent nearly a 
year and a half trying to encourage 
people to continue sse and we're 
just beginning to witness there-
sults of hard work at building up 
an organization. We certainly did 
better last year than the year be-
fore." 

Whether this year will be the 
pivotal year of the group's success 
or the year of its death has yet to 
be seen. Two things are certain. 
First, if SSC takes hold, so will the 
idea that personal counseling does 
not require emotional "sickness." 
And second, if the service dis-
appears, the need for it will not. 0
