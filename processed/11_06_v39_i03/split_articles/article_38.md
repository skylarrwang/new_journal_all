**Title: A Post-Grad's Pursuit of Ivy League Campus Tours**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
how up to a college tour any
college tour and you're guar-
anteed to encounter numerous
'
species: breathless mothers arriving
early to make a good impression;
bored siblings rendered deaf by iP-
ods; .nostalgic alums; and locals who
drift along to kill·time.

But one demographic you'll be
hard-pressed to find is recent uni-
versity grads. So why, on one recent
Yale tour, was a pair of young South-
ern gentlemen, fresh out of Baylor
and the University of Georgia, trail-
ing a group of Japanese tourists and
high school seniors?

Diplomas in hand, Brent Hill,
25, and Cal Knight, 23, had but two
dreams. One: to move to New York
City capital of what was, for them,
the uncharted and enticing North-
east territory and strike it big; a
pretty standard goal for young pro-
fessionals. Item number two? To go
on a campus tour of every single Ivy
League university. It's part of a list of
things they'd like to do in the North-
east, along with skiing in Vermont,
fishing off Long Island, and camping
in the Catskills. They commemorate
their trek by purchasing t-shirts at
each school. Together, they cultivate
their love, no, make that their pas-
sion for Ivy League campus tours.

As of November, the deter-
mined duo has visited the University
of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Har-
vard, and Yale. Cal is eager to visit
Dartmouth. Brent looks forward to
Brown. Neither really wants ·to see
Cornell, but they both feel they must
for the sake of the mission. Mter a
year of tours, they have mastered the
art of the campus visit. "Get there
early so you can see the town," Cal
suggests. Brent spends days scouring
each college's website for maps and
tour schedules, crafting tightly-regi-
mented itineraries.

But once you have a diploma in
hand, what could possibly be the ap-
peal of taking campus tours?

"Well basically, we go to college
campuses to try to date tour guides,"
Brent explains. "No, no, I'm just
joking. It's a joke, I promise." Cal
laughs awkwardly. "He's kidding."

So, if not for the Ivy League
broads whom Cal arid Brent de-
scribe as "extremely book smart but
not necessarily socially smart or at-
tractive"

then for what?

Shiela Pastor, Director of Yale's
Visitor Center, is certain that the
boys have a hidden agenda. When
she hears about their epic journey,
she shakes her head. "Well now, that
is unusual, yes. I've never heard any-
one say they were doing this before.
Maybe they're writing a book? I just
don't know why you'd ever do that
once you graduate from college."

Her colleague nods emphatically in
agreement.

Cal insists their reasons are
harmless: "I was going to be an ar-
chitecture major in college. These
schools are great places to see archi-
tecture, like how that Yale guy bur-
ied the stones in the ground to make
them look old and poured acid down
Harkness tower."

Brent's motives or at least those
he will fess up to
are equally tame.

"Being from Kansas, you always
hear about the Ivy League. Now that
I'm in New York City, Ivy League
schools are one of the things I want
.
,
to expenence.

The pair's Southern ·hospitality,
however, makes them easy targets for
Yankee swindlers. At Harvard, t_hey
•
say, "fake" tour guides hustled them
outside of the train station, trying to
persuade them to. take their tour in-
stead of the official version.

"Honestly, those fake tour guides
looked kind of shady. We don't know
if they were actually students
"

Cal interrupts: ''Not as shady ·
as the people outside of the New
Haven train station!" Evidently, the
Elm City didn't treat the visitors
very well.

With four schools down and
four to go, the boys have reached
some preliminary conclusions:
• Oddest tour guide? Harvard's. Ac-
cording to Brent, she was "your clas-
sic Ivy League girl." Cal adds, "You
could tell that she probably has so-
cial anxiety disorder."
•Greatest mystery? Whether or not
to tip their tour guide.
• School of choice? "Princeton for
undergrad and then Harvard for grad
school," Cal says.

"You know, I don't know if
I'd necessarily want to go to an Ivy
League university," Brent tieclares at
one point. "It's not necessarily the
ultimate college experience."

But twenty minutes later, after
excitedly describing their journey,
Brent has changed his tune. "I think
I probably would go ~o whichever
Ivy League school would let me in."
