**Title: America Wants You**
**Author: Nicole Allan**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

icholas Edward Panza, America wants you. 
Beyond your casual speech, I hear her sing-
ing to your lean rower's body, your gleeful 
enthusiasm. I sense her thirsting to claim your bot-
tled Yalie energy, your Exeter polish and your Ivy · 
gleam 
rooted in a Pasadena past. 

: America, Nick Panza, is soft. Remember when 
she crumbled? It pushed you .over the edge. Now, 
you say, when you hear them talk the softies, the 
liberals 
you get seriously, seriously disturbed. Do 
they love America? Some of them say they do. But 
you, Nick Panza 
you love America. 

our coach once told you, before you leaped into 
your boat and rowed until your lungs flamed, to 
embrace the pain. Nick Panza, you leap in that boat 
and embrace that pain. And you did. You do. It's a 
good thing you call yourself a masochist. 

When you left Yale for the summer and showed 
up for that first day at Officer Candidate School, and 
they emptied your bag onto the hot glinting Virginia 
asphalt, you saw it coming. Hours of pre-dawn pull-
ups and push-ups and sprints and planks. Breakfast , 
lunch, and dinner with a rifle by your side. An end-
less bay of bunks. Disorientation, you describe, all 
the time because, Candidate Panza, battle is any-
thing but order. 

Did you complain? You say Officer Candidate 
School was awesome, the sweetest thing ever. Six 
weeks so sweet you had to go back. You wanted to 
finish right then and there, but you were reclaimed 
by Yale. Its lectures and protests and keggers. If any-
one gives me shit, you said, he's dead. You were hard 
in a sea of soft. 

Back at school, you set up a recruiting table on 
the quad. Semper Fi, . your poster trumpeted, ever 
20 
faithful. The few, the proud, the Marines. Ears cupping 
out from your fuzzed brown hair, you wore your Marine 
t-shirt with your flip-flops and bare tanned legs. A kid 
edged over and said, Thanks, man thank you for what 
you're doing. Another spat out, I hate the military. You 
said, You hate the military? Go join the Taliban. 

One guy read your brochure, looked you in the eye, 
-
said I want to join the Marines. You said great. He said, 
I'm gay. You, Candidate Panza, said I can't help you. 

merica knows you don't come from a "military fam-
. y," as you put it. She knows that, and she wants 
you anyway. She knows they weren't thrilled when you 
told them. You could be an investment banker, you recall 
them saying. Eighty thousand. your first year. You an-
swered that OCS is nonbinding. You still could be. 

After all, America's too smart to gobble you, Nick 
Panza, up all in one bite. She'll savor you week by tnonth 
by year; she got you for six weeks after your sophotnore 
; 
. 
year for Platoon Leaders Class at the 
Quantico base, and she'll get you for 
another six this summer. She'll even 
pay you for it. Usually, America de-
mands the summer after junior year 
for your second leg of PLC, but she 
wanted you so very much that she 
let you defer a year. You needed to 
train with your team. By then, if 
you haven't gotten kicked out and 
you, Panza, that'll never happen to 
you she'll have you for six months 
at The Basic School." You'll finally be 
able to shoot the bullets she denied 
you at first, though you've spent 
four months cradling your weapon. 

After fighting for your specialty, 
infantry or law or intelligence or 
tanks or aviation you want intel, 
but things change, America lets you 
change. Once you decide, you"ll 
spend weeks or months getting spe-
cific. Then comes the contract, the 
assignment you'll go anywhere 
and 
everywhere 
hopefully 
where there are terrorists. Three and 
a half years minimum. Technically, 
you could still be an investment 
banker. But America, Nick Panza, is 
used to getting her way. 

ou tell your friends why you 
went to Quantico. When they 
get all political on you, because col-
lege kids usually do, you can take 
it. Did you vote for Bush? No, but 
everyone knows you're a conser-
vative. You didn't vote for him, 
but you love his America. You are 
quick to declare that you, Nick 
Panza, will support America no 
matter who's running it and who's 
getting bombed. 

You liked being around people 
like yourself. You try to explain 
how the candidates appreciated their 
freedoms, how they didn't take any-
thing for granted you, d never seen 
character like that before. And, let's 
be honest, they were hoots; you'd 
never choked back so many laughs. 

Not many people know how 
funny the military is, but you, Can-
didate Panza, you tell them. You 
keep track of what the Sergeant In-
structors say, and you tell everyone 
you know. Like when anSI explained 
that your M 16 was like a woman in 
black leather she demands respect 
and enjoys pain. Remember that? 

And the SI who told a candidate he 
didn't like guys, but if he kept it up 
he'd stick it in backwards. Ah, wasn't 
that the same one who asked, ~don't 
you want to feel what it's like to pull 
a man's heart out of his chest while 
it's still beating? That was damn 
funny, you say. 

id you like fitting in, Candi-
date Panza? Mos candidates 
do. You admit that you understand 
why the military sticks to Don't Ask 
Don't Tell. You do love your meat-
and -potatoes, after all 
a delicious 
side to your matching M16"s and 
masculinity, your we're-not-black-
, 
h' 
' 
we re-not-w tte-we re-green mot-
to. You kept it hush-hush that you 
went to Yale. It didn't end up being 
a big deal, but your bunkrnates went 
to Iowa State and Valley Forge, so 
you mostly stayed quiet. You're 
just a candidate, you told yourself, 
just one more candidate giving your 
summer to America. 

When you boarded your flight 
home, Nick Panza, in a buzz-cut 
and a Marine t-shirt, you were 
alone. It was the most humbling 
feeling ever, you remember. You 
were so, so full of accomplish-
ment 
you grin and grin just re-
calling it now that people stopped 
you, and thanked you. Maybe they 
sensed your hardness, Candidate 
Panza, alongside their softness. Was 
that when you knew you belonged 
to America? When you began to 
declare that you wanted to do your 
part? Was that when you knew that 
· once a Marine, you, Nick Panza, 
would always be a Marine?
