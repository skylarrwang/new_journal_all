Elihu Yale's snuff boxes. Ezra Stiles will go on to pay forty shillings for them. 
dience," he will raze their houses 
and banish thejr families from 
Madras. 

In the midst of unrest, famine 
plagues the people of Madras. As a 
result, trade and factory output de-
crease. Governor Yale tries to use 
·the East India Company money to 
provide food for the people 
after 
all, healthy workers make more 
cotton stockings but the Com-
pany directors do not approve the 
expenditure. Famine presses on, 
and the Indians, the English, and 
Governor Yale wait for the rains 
and the relief they bring. 

16 91 : Elihu is a prosperous and 
unpopular governor. Through pri-
vate trade and as a company em-
ployee, he has amassed a fortune of 
five-hundred-thousand small, gold 
pellets known as pagodas 
equiva-
lent to 27 million of today's dollars. 
Suspicions that he has used com-
pany money to conduct private 
diamond trade simmer within the 
council of Fort St. George. Elihu 
negotiates the purchase of a region 
south of Madras and names it Fort 
St. David. When he attempts to ap-
point his brother as the governor of 
this new settlement, the resentment 
of the council boils over. Members 
write a fiery document, "Charges 
Against Governor Yale," and send 
it to the directors of the East India 
Company. They vilify him for fa-
voring his brother, for not paying 
customs on his private trade, for 
keeping the finest of the _ factory-
produced cloth for himself, and for 
forcing the natives to fill his coffers 
with so much money that "they 
naturally could not pay their prop-
er taxes." This document brings 
about Elihu's downfall. 

A year later, Governor Yale is 
forced to pass the keys of Fort St. 
George to the newly appointed Gov-
ernor Higginson. Despite his demo-
tion, Elihu spends seven more years 
in Madras before returning to Eng-
land. During these years, the council 
seizes his estate and accuses him of 
poisoning three council members. 
But Elihu is acquitted of all charges 
by the English Parliament. He spends 
his last years in India investing in the 
private trade of diamonds, a practice 
he continues even after returning to 
London in 1699. His most prized 
piece is forty-five carats of a velvet-
blue color which recalls its orgins in 
the Goloconda diamond vein, deep 
within Tamil N adu . 

1713 : 
Elihu is persuaded to 
donate 32 books to a new college 
isolated in the Connecticut wilder-
ness. Collectors of the funds curtly 
recount, "Mr. Yale has done some-
thing, tho very little considering 
his Estate." In 1718, Elihu receives 
a persuasive letter promising that, 
contingent upon a generous dona-
tion, the College of New Haven will 
bear his name for eternity. Perhaps 
enticed by the idea of immortaliza-
tion, he sends hundreds of books, 
a few English goods and paintings, 
and two trunks of Madras textiles 
to New Haven. The textiles, woven 
by Tamil weavers, consist of calico, 
rriuslins, poplins, and silk crepe. All 
sell for considerable profit in New 
England, and thus constitute a suit-
able donation to the floundering 
college. More than half the books 
he donates resonate with religious 
themes; Yale hopes that education 
can convert the Puritans of the new 
college to Anglicanism. Over the fol-
lowing years, representatives of Yale 
College hound him to donate more. 
Elihu promises more books, more 
goods, and more paintings. But he 
forgets, and when he remembers, he 
sends less than he promised. 

On July 11, 1721, Elihu Yale 
passes away, and his will is read. 
Nothing is promised to his ccwick-
ed wife," but five hundred pounds 
are promised to the cc Connectic<?te 
College." As the will is neither dated 
nor signed, its validity is contested. 
Stepdaughters, sons-in-law, repre-
sentatives of Yale College, and a re-
ligious group all compete for slices 
of the fortune. After three-and-a-
half years, a Yale representative 
writes that, ccwe lost Our Cause in 
the Commons by the vile decree of 
the Dean of the Arches, who, I ver-
ily believe was corrupted." Though 
hope of receiving the last five hun-
dred pounds is dashed Yale Col-
lege keeps its name. Elihu's total 
donation to the college amounts to 
£1,162. Though only a meager por-
tion of his wealth, this donation 
links his name, and Tamil Nadu, to 
a college he has never seen .

gothic spires that Elihu's Madras 
textiles helped to build. It is the

seniors, I visit the Yale campus and 
sit through a nervous interview on 
Hillhouse Avenue. Waiting in line at 
a f9od cart, my father proceeds to 
call his friend and talk rather loud-
ly about the grandeur and beauty 
of Yale. "I can see why any parent 
would want their child to go here!,, 
A tall, bearded man ahead of us 
looks back and smiles. I apologize 
for my· embarrassing father, and a 
conversation springs up. The man 
asks my father where he is from. 
When he says he is originally from 
Chennai formerly known as Ma-
dras in India, the man's blue eyes 
brighten and he exclaims, "Tamilia-
naa ?" He begins to speak rapidly in 
Tamil about how he lived and stud-
ied in Tamil Nadu for five years. He 
even rocks and nods his head like a 
native Tamilian. This is my intro-
duction to Anthropology Professor 
Bernard Bate. 

Neither my father nor I have 
ever met a non-Indian fluent in 
Tamil, and we are silent while our 
surprise subsides. I can't even .keep 
up with Bate's rapid speech. During 
the next ten minutes, Professor Bate 
excitedly informs me that Tamil will 
be taught at Yale for the first time in 
the fall. He strides towards his car 
and beckons to us, "Vaango, vaan-
go," asking us to join him in his of-
fice. We politely decline. 


2 0 0 5 : A year and a h~lf later, 
Professor Bate confides to me that 
he thought he had scared my father 
and me away that summer day. We 
were certainly in awe of him. He 
had made me excited that Tamil, a 
language I could understand but 
still wished to gain literacy and flu-
ency in, was to be taught at Yale. 
When it came time for me to choose 
a college in April, Tamil was a dis-
tinguishing factor. 

My timing is opportune. Just 
two years before I arrived on cam-
pus, proposals to offer a Tamil 
course were being written, presented, 
and debated. The South Asian Stud-
ies Program was being built around 
the arrival of Arjun Appadurai, an 
eminent professor of contemporary 
South Asia and social thought, and 
Carol Breckenridge, a professor of 
South Asian history. "In the winter 
of 2002, there was all this excite-
ment about South Asia," says Bate, 
looking back. "It was then that I 
thought we should bring Tamil here. 
Early the next year we were writing 
proposals." He, Appadurai, Breck-
enridge, and Economics Professor 
T.N. Srinivasan presented proposals 
to the Language Study Committee. 

Tamil is one of two classical, lit-
erary Indian languages. It is the thir-
teenth most spoken language in the 
world, surpassing I tali an and Kore-
an. Along with Man_darin and Ara-
bic, Tamil has the oldest continuous 
literary tradition of any language: a 
history of two millennia. It is main-
ly spoken in the south Indian state 
of Tamil N adu, and is a native lan-
guage in Sri Lanka, Singapore, and 
Malaysia. In addition, Mauritian, 
Fijian, South African, and American 
diasporas have transplanted Tamil 
to those countries. This is the lan-
guage yale did not offer. 

Thanks to faculty mobiliza-
tion and a petition, students pe-
rusing the 2004-2005 Yale College 
Programs of Study could find a 
course under the South Asian Stud-
ies section entitled TAML 115: 
INTRODUCTORY TAMIL. 

That first year, eight students 
signed up. The next year, along with 
a sophomore from Sri Lanka and 
a graduate student, I enrolled as a 
freshman in the introductory level. 
Both the graduate student and I 
could understand Tamil quite well, 
but our speech was fragmented and 
we were illiterate. Our Sri Lankan 
peer had learned to read and write 
Tamil growing up, but his compre-
hension and speech skills were at a 
lower level than ours. The instruc-
tor, Professor Elayaperumal Anna-
tnalai, skillfully tailored the class to 
our individual needs. One day, he 
brought us rasam, a spicy tomato 
and lentil soup, and, as we tasted

the dish, we · discussed its cooking 
process and learned new, culinary 
words. We watched a Tamil movie 
about the politics, corruption, and 
bureaucracy of building a house in · 
India. We learned about issues of 
gender, caste, and race in Tamil so-
ciety. At the end of the year, we rel-
ished steaming south Indian rices, 
soups, and vegetable curries at 
Annamalai,s house. We grew very 
close as a class; the small number 
gave us room to learn the subtleties 
of the language. 

This fall, the class remains small; 
three students are in Intermediate 
Tamil and three are in the introduc-
tory level. The administration is not 
satisfied with this enrollment. "The 
question is: will it be more than a 
single digit number?" says George 
Joseph, assistant secretary of the 
Yale Office of International Affairs. 
"Is there a possibility of it ever going 
back up?" 

"There is a sense of unease 
about having three [students per 
level]," Bate says, "but U. Chicago 
has those numbers. Harvard and 
Columbia have those numbers." 

Aside from small class size, an-
other issue dogs the administration: 
the lack of academic outlets for stu-
dents who study TamiL "How does 
Professor Elayaperumal Annamalai teaches TAM L 115. 
Tamil fit into University scholarship 
right now? I think there is an ex-
pectation that if you,re learning a 
language, you will use it elsewhere 
in the curriculum," Joseph says. Yet 
Hindi, which boasts a far greater 
enrollment than Tamil, has only one 
such class: ''Hindi in the Diaspora." 
Tamil itself appears in Bates anthro-
pology classes such as ''Gender and 
Media in India" and in Annamalai's 
anthropology 
class, 
''Language, 
Politics, and Society in India." 

The issue truly clouding Tamii>s 
future at Yale is funding. The South 
Asian Studies Council is the new-
est of all the academic councils, and 
is therefore not as well-endowed. 
''You have to look anywhere, ev-
erywhere for money,,, Joseph says . 
''Funding is needed for paying teach-
ers and for books and publications . 
We would like to build our library 
collections and we would like our 
students to study in Chennai." 

Yale has discovered a particular 
fund within the Tamil Nadu govern-
ment that may be used to promote 
the study of Tamil abroad. This past 
September, Joseph traveled to Tamil 
N adu and met with its Chief Minis-
ter to discuss applying this fund to-
wards Tamil studies at Yale. Despite 
its vast endowment, Yale is asking a 
developing country for financial as-
sistance. But last summer, an indi-
vidual donor made a gift to the Uni-
versity tagged specifically for Tamil 
studies. This gift might ensure that 
Tamil will be offered next year, but 
what about the year after that? 

1699: A stout, 'fifty-year-old Eli-
hu Yale leans upon the rim of a ship 
bound for England. He gazes for 
the last time at the towers of Fort 
St. George, the catamarans beached 
on the scalding sand, and the curv-
ing coastline of Madras. During the 
six-month voyage back to England, 
he will recall his travels, his rise and 
fall, his diamonds. Elihu breathes 
his last breath of Madras air: a brew 
of salt, fish, and spice. He hears two 
fishermen speaking to each other in 
Tamil, arguing heatedly. Perhaps he 
catches a word or two; perhaps he 
gleans a sliver of their argument. He 
turns and descends into the ship,s 
belly to join the chintz, gingham, 
and diamonds, leaving this language 
behind forever.
