THE SHORT DRIVE OUT TO FAIR 
Haven feels like a century of ur-
ban decay on fast-forward: Yale 
passes behind you, then downtown, 
still ''reawakening,.,, and then the 
sad, shoddy buildings that line the 
highways winding toward the city's 
half-vacant industrial core. Among 
the empty warehouses that once fu-
eled America's First Planned City, 
across . from an overgrown plant 
nursery, Rob Fecke has erected an 
almost painfully self-aware symbol 
of urban renewal. F ecke, a charmer 
with the slouchy mannerisms of a 
ski bum, tousles his bright mane of 
blonde hair as he says of his busi-
ness, ''We are, like, the epitome of 
economic development." 


Fecke's Reclamation Lumber 
salvages and resells old timber from 
turn -of-the-century mills, factories, 
and other overlooked buildings like 
colonial agricultural silos. The very 
first building F ecke entered eight 
years ago to gut for lumber was 
the 19th-century Winchester Arms 
Company, the long-collapsed lode-
star of New Haven's economy. He 
used its logs for a commercial build-
ing in Litchfield.


Fecke's business model feeds off 
the history he dismantles, breeding 
new life from the dried timbers. He 
turns ancient planks from collaps-
ing, century-old buildings into ·us-
able wood and then sells it at two 
to three times the price of fresh-cut 
lumber. 


Within the factory, a hive -of 
workers twitter in English and 
Spanish. They are in the process of 
reclaiming an old gym . floor from 
Albertus Magnus College, splintered 
boards from the Yale bowl, and a 
filthy-looking piece of an Amish 
country-house from Pennsylvania. 
Here, the wood goes through a slow 
rebirth. Workers clean off half an 
inch of grime, rot, and water damage 
and then reshape the wood to form 
perfect, rectangular planks. Fecke 
keeps a sort of family album of where 
his offspring end up: the floor of an 
office in Litchfield, a deluxe apart-
ment in Manhattan, and the bases of 
those tiny, ubiquitous table tents in 
every Yale dining hall. 


The Yale Sustainable Food Proj-
ect collaborates with Rob Fecke to 
make these centerpieces. Josh Vi-
ertel, the project's director, gushes 
that, ''It's really beautiful orange 
wood ... Beautiful, beautiful wood: 
doesn't need any finish, doesn't 
need any paint." He's referring to 
what people in the business call a 
"patina," a luster that wood gains 
only with age. Fecke and Viertel 
claim that old wood has a richer and 
deeper color and that dense clusters 
of growth rings create a more du-
rable, stable piece of lumber. Vier-
tel can hardly bring himself to buy 
wood from anyone else: the Food 
Project's greenhouses are·assembled 
with slats from an old, beachside 
boardwalk, and the roof of its wood-
burning oven was pulled from a 
factory in East Haven. Viertel even 
purchased reclaimed lumber for the 
compost bins and stakes. With Fecke 
he feels a ''connection with someone 
who's into materials, into policy." 


Of course, recycled wood is more 
sustainable. "They're all a bunch of 
greenheads over there," Fecke says 
of Yale. "It's a good thing." Fecke is 
a fervent environmentalist himself. 
He talks passionately of Wall Street 
and its environmentally destructive 
incentives system, the history of log-
ging and carpentry, and how chemi-
cal treatments have changed Ameri- . 
can practices forever. He talks about 
fast-growing trees that can never 
compare to the products of ancient 
forests, and how, for most of their 
history, humans have recycled wood 
to build new structures. History, for 
F ecke, has been nothing more than a 
continuous process of rebuilding. 


But when asked if he's involved 
in any other environmental ·causes, 
Fecke says he's not. Then, zooming 
almost instantly into the microscop-
ic details of running his business, he 
describes his plans for expansion and 
a big meeting when he will display 
his showroom to architects. He says 
he wants to win back the "battle-
ground" that is industrial Fair Haven. 


There· is something else that Recla-
mation Lumber is trying to reclaim: 
a section of the city that he wants to 
"win back." And that's not a surpris-
ing idea to hear from one of the few 
who believes that at least something 
in New Haven has aged well.
