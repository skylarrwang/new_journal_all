that though "the University may 
not have intended to provide a space 
for the education of non-students, 
including people who were home-
less," the generosity's uqjntentional 
nature "was what made the act spe-
cial: it came without strings or self-
interest on the university's part.,, 
During his time at Yale, Morton co-
founded Harmony Place and Re-
spect Line, two projects of the Yale 
Homelessness and Hunger Action 
Project. While Morton concedes 
that student access must remain 
the library system's top priority, he 
does not believe the University,s 
devotion to its students should 
preclude it from sharing resources. 
He is quick to point out that Yale 
receives ample .funds from the gov-
ernment and should use some of 
those resources to lower its metal 
bars and welcome the public inside. 
The ID scanner acts as a barrier to 
this sort of welcome, and Morton, 
referencing the French philosopher 
Michel Foucault, says, celt creates a 
ritualistic reenactment of status. If 
every day you get in and get kicked 
out at a certa1n t1me, your pos1t1on 
is inscribed." 
Meanwhile, Yale students ~re 
growing accustomed to the turn-
stile. It's ccinconsequential/' said 
Sophomore Ari Baraban. ccEv-
eryone knows it's there." Where 
Morton sees a ritual reenactment 
of status, Nitecki has seen "expres-
sions of delight" on the faces of stu-
dents when the cc gentle bar" lowers 
for them. 

But there are others who find 
the bar emblematic of encroaching 
injustices. "When things go unchal-
lenged," Morton says, ccthey simply 
become natural facts."
