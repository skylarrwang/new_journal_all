EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
flat on his face. So you,re writing 
that paper for Professor Vincent 
Scully, aren,t you? After years of 
seeing students trek to Morse just 
to stare at me for a week and then 
never give me another glance, rve 
wised up. I can tell some of you just 
want to melt me down, but class is 
class, and papers must be written, 
so you kids learn to bullshit. 
I don't mind. I know Scully as-
signs this paper every year. Should 
I be placed on Old Campus? Or 
left at Morse, where I live now? I 
know I attract more sneers than 
admiring glances 
after all, r m a 
big, metal lipstick on top of a big, 
scary tank. Do you know what an 
identity criss that creates? rve al-
ways taken some comfort in being 
called a "work of art., But art, to 
most of you, is the David, with his 
handsome proportions and flawless 
musculature Queen Bee by luck-
of-the-form. I, on the other hand, 
am designed to be too much to 
handle. Michelangelo made David 
"larger than life,: Claes Oldenburg 
made me absurdly gargantuan. 
rm at peace enough with where 
I am. Here, Scully says my "wonder-
ful international orange stands out 
against the sky.'' Here, 0 ldenburg 
says, I "turn on the sky., I know, 
that doesn't help my reputation as 
a big phallic joke, but ir>s one of the 
nicest things anyone has ever said 
about me. When I was installed in 
Beinecke Plaza in '69, people tossed 
around the idea of giving me a part-
ner a cigarette butt perched on 
the low wall, to complete the look. 
But they left me alone, so you kids 
graffitied me and postered me" my 
exposed tracks rusted, and I was 
Â·taken away. 
I can see what you scribble 
-
down. You think I can,t read? rve 
gone to college for 38 years. This 
year, one of you called my cur-
rent home "cramped" but wrote 
in your paper that r d look out of 
_shape and silly on Old Campus. If 
October 2006 
she were forced to move me there, 
she, d smush me between Bingham 
and Vanderbilt, next to the recy-
cling bins and trash. She is in the 
c'melt-me-down,, camp. They talk 
about doing it behind my back all 
the time, but you can,t let it get to 
you. Ir>s important to keep a cool, 
metal shell. 
Others seem scared of me,-
scared that I might start rolling and 
crush everything in my path, or 
that I might launch a missile from 
my shaft. They,re in the "can,t-
separate-life-from-art, camp. In 
the 70s, I served as an anti-war 
platform. These days, students see 
a military machine. rm what you 
kids make of me. 
Yup, kid, sitting down is a 
good idea, especially if .you,re so-
ber. (Remember that drunk kid, 
who tanked off me?) Whar>s that? 
I would have given you some com-
fort on 0 ld Campus? Ah, a healthy 
dose of the absurd the day you ar-
rived. Something else out of place, 
standing tall and proud. You think 
that all of the other "lost" freshman 
would empathize with me? Well, 
kid, rm not the lost one. You,re 
the one talking to a statue instead 
of writing your paper. 
Eh! What are you doing now? 
You know, you get even funnier-
looking when you're down on your 
hands and knees. You're crawling 
underneath me? Yeah, rm hollow 
inside (ir>s a body-image problem 
I've struggled with for years). But 
people usually experience me from 
the outside, you realize. Are you 
standing up? Careful there. Whoa! 
Kid, I haven,t been touched there 
in years!
