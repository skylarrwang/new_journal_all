IN 2006, ONE HUNDRED YALE STU-
dents gathered to protest the war in 
Iraq. A generation earlier, on May 
15\ 1970, 15,000 Yale students and 
demonstrators from around the 
country gathered in New Haven to 
protest the murder trial of the Black 
Panther party chairman, Â· Bobby 
Seale. Numbers like these have led 
many to point to a decline in po-
litical activism on college campuses 
since the end of the Vietnam era. 
Though these protests occurred 36 
years apart, the Stromberg family 
was at Yale for both . 

Before Cliff Stromberg '71 even 
takes a seat at a meeting of Yale do-
nors, he pulls out a pamphlet stu-
dents handed to him earlier. It pro-
claims that a staggering one fifth 
of Yale's undergraduate population 
comes from only seventy of the na-
tion's high schools. He looks at the 
pamphlet, then cautiously suggests, 
"Aren't there more serious issues to 
be fighting?" 

Stromberg matriculated at Yale 
in 1967, when the university was 
still an all male bastion and stu-
dents wore coats and ties to class. 
Reflecting on his first two years at 
Yale, Stromberg believes that the 
political spectrum on campus dur-
ing that period was similar to the 
range of opinions on campus today. 
In 1969, however, women arrived: 
The ties came off, the draft became 
a reality, the civil rights movement 
was in full force, and the political 
spectrum shrank. "There was no 
gradual change. The difference be-
tween 1967 and 1969 was like the 
difference between 1945 and 1969," 
Stromberg says. "'LiberaP turned 
into a dirty word it implied you 
weren't radical enough. Any asso-
ciation with the Democratic Party 
branded you as a 'sellout to the 
establishment."' 

Stromberg's wife, Dr. Eva Fein-
er '71, attended Swarthmore for two 
years before transferring to Yale in 
the fall of '69. Feiner remembers the 
campus reverberating with the feel-
ing that "we were united in a potent 
moment in history where we could 
actually change things." The sheer 
number of baby boomers created a 
sense of power, and the shaky state 
of the economy eased students' fears 
that their involvement with protests 
would threaten their otherwise 
bright futures. Political philosophy 
and revisionist history were incor-
porated into all levels of education. 
It was more than a period of social 
and political change; it was an intel-
lectual revolution. 

Stromberg and Feiner's daugh-
ter, Kimberly Stromberg, is a senior 
at Yale and has just completed her 
run as publisher of the Yale Daily 
News. She combines her parents' 
former idealism with their cur-
rent ambition. An Economics and 
History double major, Kimberly 
dresses in cowboy boots and funky 
scarves when not suited up for a fi-
nance interview. Though she has a 
job at a New York City investment 
bank lined up for next year, Kim-
berly is quick to emphasize that 
this occupation is merely a starting 
point; a necessary step before she 
can pursue something more mean-
ingful, perhaps related to interna-
tional economic development. 

The Yale that Kimberly attends 
barely resembles the university of 
her parents' years. The sense of be-
longing to a "potent moment in his-
tory" no longer exists. Ins_tead, her 
father points out, "Kids .today are 
more practical about changing the 
world in concrete, local ways: Teach 
for America, personal projects in 
Guatemala, advocating for environ-
mental reform, interning in D.C." 

At the Yale Kimberly's parents 
experienced, any progressive po-
litical action had to be anti-estab-
lishment. "I couldn't imagine even 
considering business school when I 
graduated from Yale," Feiner says. 
"It wasn't considered intellectual 
enough." Instead, she received her 
Ph.D. in government at Harvard, an 
experience she describes as wonder-
ful but not quite right for her. "It 
was a politically correct decision." 
After graduate school and "an edu-
cation in the real world," Feiner de-
cided that she could best change the 
system from the inside. "I started to 
believe that the markets could have 
a more sweeping effect in improv-
ing people's lives than government 
imposed policies." Feiner has head-
ed IBM's Department for Interna-
tional Trade and Development. 

Kimberly knows her parents see 
their careers as much more "estab-
lishment'' than the professions they 
had envisioned as undergraduates. 
Nevertheless, both parents feel they 
have successfully found ways to ex-
press the values they learned at Yale, 
and Kimberly hopes to do the same. 
But by following her parents' half-
rebellious road, she is by definition 
less rebellious. 

The political activity Kimberly 
sees on the Yale campus is largely 
intellectual or institutionalized: the 
Roosevelt Institute, bus trips to 
canvas for votes, politically inclined 
magazines like The Hippolytic. And 
yet, while everyone seems to have 
an opinion, few students spend 
significant time instigating radical 
political change. Unlike her par-
ents' generation, Kimberly and her 
friends tend to accept their parents' 
politics. Many seniors at Yale have 
parents who were, at their age, part 
of a revolutionary moment in his-
tory. And though they have heard 
stories of how their parents rebelled 
against the establishment, these same 
parents have more often than .not 
landed themselves "establishment" 
careers that pay for their tuition. 

Like their formerly radical par-
ents, many current Yale students 
have chosen to work within the 
system by taking I -banking careers, 
completing D.C. internships, and 
teaching in under-funded public 
schools. Perhaps this is not so much 
an indication of apathy, but rather a 
sign that as times change, so do the 
best ways to effect further change.
