a knife across the throat," she recalls.

Both Romeo and Giuseppe
avoid specifics. "Do I have to go
into all this detail?" Giuseppe snaps
in a rare display of frustration. Romeo
says, "I never tried, you know
the truth, I never tried to do some-
thing bad ... to ~nyone." Giuseppe
will relate ,his emotional reaction to
the breakup, b~t even that requires
a disclaimer: ''This is not a story I
tell around."

Romeo and Giuseppe are the
Montague and Capulet of Orange
Street: two men born in the same
year, nurtured by the same land, who
crossed the same ocean and tried to
make their fortunes together, only
to be wrenched ·apart by jealousy
ahd betrayal. But their story has
remained shrouded in omerta
an
Italian principle of silence that Ro-
meo and Giuseppe carried · to New
Haven from the old country-
until now.

Romeo Simeone and Giuseppe
Sabino were born in 1950 in
Formicola, Italy, a srpall town in
the province of Caserta, about 45
kilometers north of Naples. Gi-
useppe imagines he emerged from .
the womb already hard at work.
"I was born working. I was born
working with my father in the fields
of Italy," he says. While helping to
plant olives, tomatoes, grapes, and
chestnuts on his family's small farm,
Giuseppe developed an impeccable
knowledge of vegetables.

Nearby, in another section of
the comuni, Romeo rein to work at
his uncle's grocery store each day
after school. When his uncle made
trips to the marke.t, he would bring
young Romeo along. "I saw the
mushrooms, and the chestnuts
all
of those stuff like that. And I learn,"
Romeo remembers aloud in his
warm and raspy voice. Even as chil-
dren, Romeo and Giuseppe had al-
ready begun to cultivate their trade.

When Giuseppe was 16, he left
Formicola and immigrated to New
Haven with his mother and older
brother, Vincent. It wasn't a clean
break. Giuseppe took on three jobs
to support his family
at a soda bot-
tling plant, a pocketbook shop, and
a steel warehouse
and his heart
remained in Formicola. Giuseppe
and his brother frequently returned
to their hometown on vacation, and
back home the brothers re-kin-
dled old romances. They married
their sweethearts in Italy, and then
brought their young brides back to
New Haven. When Romeo's sis-
ter, Josephine, married Giuseppe's
brother, Vincent, the two men be-
came family.


In 1974, Romeo and his brother
Cesare arrived in New Haven with
nothing. Meanwhile, Giuseppe had
worked his way up to the position
of general manager of the steel ware-
house, so he helped the Simeone

brothers settle in: ccwe found them
jobs. Everything. We took them in
as our own family," Giuseppe re-
calls ruefully.

In 1982, Giuseppe moved his
family which now included daugh-
ter Rosanna and son Antonio
back
to Formicola. Seven years later, af-
ter building a house and opening
a grocery store in his native town,
Giuseppe experienced a change of
heart: "I figured my kids had more
opportunities in America than in
Italy." And so Giuseppe returned,
only to find the roles were reversed:
Now, he had a wife and two kids
but no work, while Romeo was
running "Romeo's Imports," a suc-
cessful Italian trade store on Grand
Avenue, in the Wooster Square area
November 2006
of New Haven.

According to Giuseppe, it was
then that Romeo tipped him off
about the Orange Street property.
But, Giuseppe insists that cc original-
ly it was supposed to be only mine.
And my fan1ily's. So we put all our
efforts in, to build the business up.
And Romeo, he said, 'I'll help you
to start it. Because there was a re-
lationship between family, a family
relation, I thought nothing of it."

They never put anything on paper.
Romeo remembers things dif-
ferently. He claims that he sold the
Grand Avenue store, moved his
business to Orange Street, and then
let Giuseppe in on the enterprise
because he was family. "That's why
he was, we give, we make a partner,
we make
"Romeo, who struggles
with English, gives up and cuts to
the chase. "It was a big mistake!"
he says, and then laughs impish-
ly, as if admitting something he
-shouldn't have.

Both men seem to have shut out
any memory of the 14 years they,
their wives, and their kids labored
together to make a vibrant, intimate
place for the neighborhood to buy
gounnet food. The sour end makes
those times when Romeo and Gi-
useppe devoted their lives to each

other impossible to revisit.

ut listening·to Giuseppe and Ro-
meo talk, a rough sketch of the
events leading up to the cataclysmic
moment emerges. According to Gi-
useppe, trouble had been brewing
from the very beginning: "As soon
as they came in, hell started. Every-
body was robbing everybody." Gi-
useppe keeps the accusations gen-
eral; but he paints· the theft more as
fistfuls of cash snatched from the
register that both Romeo and Gi-
useppe's wives and children worked
than doctored receipts or 'dubious
accounting. The treachery lived
right at the surface, right among the
melanzana, broccolini, and cavol-
fiore, and Giuseppe knew it.

Just as the duplicity within the
aisles of Romeo and Giuseppe's
reached a fever pitch, Giuseppe
learned about an empty store prop-
erty just a few blocks away. Giuseppe
had a minor real estate business
he
owned a few houses around the
neighborhood and when he asked
his children if he should buy the·
building, they said yes. Giuseppe
does not clarify exactly what he in-
tended to do with the store; Peter
DeRose, who owned yet another
Italian market on Orange Street at
the time, thinks Giuseppe meant the
building to be a gift to his son, An-
tonio, to open his own pizza market
or prepared food store. Giuseppe
connects the purchase to Romeo's
stealing, yet insists it was business as
usual. He had always bought good
properties, and this was just another
one.

lation swirls around the intentions

Questions abound: why, if Ro-
meo stole so egregiously, did Gi-
useppe not confront his partner
earlier? Why, really, did Joe buy the
other property? And why was this
an unpardonable offense to Romeo?
nThey had' a dispute," Peter DeRose
says when I ask him what happened.
''There's just no other nationality
that will stab you in the back like
the Italians.''

This, in fact; is the key: no one
cares what the details that caused
the drama were
they were merely
the occasion for the histrionic be-
havior that followed. Whatever the
cause of his wrath, Romeo did not
confront Giuseppe to tell him they
should split; he plotted, carefully
and patiently, until the locks ·were
changed overnight, and he could
summon Giuseppe to see what he
had done, the world as his witness.

· For Giuseppe, the details be-
hind the story have dissolved in the
emotional anguish of the betrayal
itself. Four years later, his voice
quickly rises: "I got a call, a phone
call says come down, and they were
all there like vultures. Prepared. To
attack. To attack why? Because I
help my kids buy a building? Why?
My kids are monkeys or something?
They don't have their own families?
Why?" It is the victimization that
haunts Giuseppe, and the story he
cannot keep bottled inside.

For seven or eight months,
Giuseppe barely spoke a word to
anyone. He hid in his house on
Linden Street and considered sui-
cide. On one rare excursion, Gi-
useppe bumped into a woman who
had been a regular at Romeo and
Giuseppe's, and burst into tears in
front of her. <(Imagine it like this,"
she told the sobbing Giuseppe,
"you fell down, and now you have
to get up and walk again." Giuseppe
would never forget those words. He
went home, and, watching his two-
year-old granddaughter Veronica
playing on the floor, taking cautious
baby-steps, Giuseppe knew that he
had to start all over again. Later that
year, Giuseppe opened a brand new
store the shop initially purchased
for his son and named it after his
granddaughter, Nica.

hough Romeo and Giuseppe
have each lost a brother, they
have been sustained by their ex- ·
tended family: their neightborhood.
"For me, it's like one big family,"
Romeo says, his voice dropping its
usual playfulness'. "I appreciate very
much anyone who spends one pen-
ny or ten· dollars when they come in
the door. It's very~ .. it's a pleasure.
It's very nice."

And Giuseppe, burned by his
fellow paisan, still finds himself full
of goodwill. He has made the whole
world his family: "I love everybody.
I learn to love everybody. Colors,
doesn't matter. Ages, doesn't mat-
ter. And different countries, differ-
ent cultures, I love them all, because
every one of them is human."

Throughout the drama, DeRose
has managed to remain friends with
both Romeo and Giuseppe. He has
his own take on the saga. Despite
the fireworks, he argues, little has
changed between Romeo and Gi-
useppe of Formicola, Italy: "They
both still work a lot of hours and
are very dedicated to their work. I
think it's the same thing. But now
they have to compete with each
other, which probably spurs them
both to work even harder."
