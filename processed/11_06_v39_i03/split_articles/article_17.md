AN ENORMOUS WILD PIG LURKS 
in the entryway of a building on 
Whitney Avenue. Its jaws gape. Its 
back bristles with . wiry fur. 
The 
pig's flank is made of . woven bas-
ketry. 
Painted in rich shades of 
ochre, chalk, and soot, it is actually 
a tribal dance costume acquired by 
Anthropologist Leopold Pospisil in 
the 1950s from a Tambunus village 
in Papua New Guinea. Against the 
white walls and grim linoleum of 
Yal~'s Physical Anthropology Lab, 
it seems resigned to never dance 
• 
aga1n. 

The hallways are lined with 
similar relics. Glass cases bear fes-
tive garlands of wooden beads, 
pottery artifacts~ and even a canoe 
from the Pacific Northwest. In one 
room, a delicate skeleton of a small · 
primate is poised on a branch, its 
bones eerily arranged. 

The majority of Yale's anthro-
pological specimens collect dust in 
the largest of the eighteen ·store-
rooms that house the combined 
collections of Yale and the Pea-
body Museum. Stacks and stacks 
of boxes, meticulously labeled, 
extend up to the ceiling. These 
anthropological goodies are not 
on display across the street in the 
Peabody because they are either 
insufficiently restored or insuffi-
ciently eye-catching. 

Althoug the objects are still 
accessible to researchers, curators 
may also be hesitant to put them 
in a public exhibition because of 
the controversial nature of Yale's 
ownership. Yale acquired most of 
the specimens in this room between 
1920 and 1970, before new laws re-
garding the transp·ortation of antiq-
uities were instated. ''The process 
of collection has changed a lot over 
.time," says Ben Diebold, a gradu-
ate student in the anthropology de-
partment. 

Though once artifacts 
could be shipped to the museum 
after excavations, after World War 
II, countries tightened regulations 
about the movement of antiquities. 
In the 21st century, countries tend to 
be reasonably possessive of artifacts 
discovered within their borders. 

The items in the storeroom are 
mostly relics of a time during which 
a sort of "finders, keepers" men-
tality prevailed. The grey boxes, 
Diebold explains, all contain skele-
tal material: pieces of jaw bone, tib-
ias, pelvises, a yellowed skull with 
crooked teeth. They come from 
large-scale excavations as well as 
private collections. 

"We've got a mummy in here," 
says Diebold nonchalantly, gestur-
ing towards a crate made of smooth 
wood, as small as a child's toybox. 
Inside lies a dwarfed nine-year-old 
girl from Thebes, swathed in fabric, 
a painted mask obscuring her face. 
Archeologists believe there was 
a spa near the site where she was 
found, and that at the time of her 
death, the girl was brought there for 
treatment. She ended up here. 

There is something unsettling 
about the place, with its austere 
walls and neat shelving. As coldly 
institutional as a factory warehouse, 
the room nonetheless quivers with 
eccentric stories that most students 
will never hear tales about the 
splintered femur of an ancient man, 
shards of the world's first glass, a 
mummified crocodile dozing un-
seen all tucked on shelves and nes-
tled in ordered boxes, hidden in the 
bowels of the lab, relics of the days 
when anthropologists took what 
they found and brought it here.
