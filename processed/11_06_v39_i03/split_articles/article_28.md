**A Yale Grad Spurns Academia to Write Trashy Romance Novels**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
My senior essay, "Patriarchal Society and Female Promiscuity in Jane Austen," is due in exactly three weeks. I can only imagine the look of horror on my advisor's face if I marched into her office and announced that I was blowing it off in favor of writing a sequel to Pride and Prejudice. Yale alum Lauren Willig '99, however, did just that. And she's completely unrepentant.

Four years into pursuing a doctorate in English History at Harvard, Willig abandoned her plans to become a professor. She became a law school student by day, and the author of unabashed historical chick-lit by night. Three years later, Willig is a first year associate at a New York law firm, and the author of three novels: The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, The Masque of the Black Tulip, and The Deception of the Emerald Ring.


Although Willig wasn't smote by the gavel of Harvard academia, her professors were underwhelmed by her newfound literary ambitions.
''Some of them who were interested in making history more accessible were excited about it,", she said from her office in New York. "But most of them just thought it was a great big joke."


Though she departed from the academic world, Willig's novels are full of tidbits gleaned from her years at Yale and Harvard. Her first novel, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, is mostly set in a Parisian mansion. As a Renaissance Studies major at Yale, Willig designed just such a mansion for a course in Renaissance architecture. Years later, while writing Pink Carnation, she pulled out her old notebook and transformed her humble homework into the palace of "Edouard de Balcourt." All of Willig's work is punctuated with references to poetry jokes about Keats and Wordsworth which she attributes to a stint in English 125. And, of course, Willig encountered the rudiments of her romantic heroes and villains at Yale.

After attending a Manhattan all-girls high school, Willig scouted her new co-ed environment for characters. "So much of the male stuff comes from long discussions with male friends who were like 'this is how men think'," she said. "Yale was such a great resource for mining the male psyche. I mean, you'd have the guys from  through the fire door in the common room until two in the morning."


At the end of her tenure as a doctoral candidate, Willig spent a year conducting research in England; that year was undoubtedly the biggest academic influence on her work. Her novel opens in the present day as Eloise Kelly, also a Harvard doctoral candidate, roots through the British Museum's archives for information about aristocratic British spies during the Napoleonic Wars. She stumbles upon a goldmine in letters belonging to a Mrs. Selwick-Alderly, whose ancestor, Richard Selwick, was Napoleon's Egyptologist by day and the Purple Gentian, Britain's most dangerous spy by night. But although the Selwick family files are rife with information on the Purple Gentian and his predecessor, the Scarlet Pimpernel, they also contain references to the Pink Carnation, the last and greatest of the troika of British aristocratic spies and the only one who was never unmasked.


The Pink Carnation follows Eloise's quest to discover the identity of its titular spy. She begins by following the odyssey of Amy Halcourt. Orphaned and exiled during the French Revolution, Amy returns home to France at the request of her brother, Edouard, who has become an intimate of Napoleon. Amy, however, has a secret motive: to find the Purple Gentian whose identity is still unknown and join his league of spies. Once she encounters Richard Selwick, the predictable comedy of mistaken identities ensues, leading to an inevitable climax replete with poisoned brandy, an antique pistol, and an iron maiden. There are, of course, the obligatory sex scenes—this is, after all, a romance novel—but far fewer than in most novels of its ilk; Willig clearly prefers international intrigue to bodice ripping.


The novel's biggest problem is its use of Eloise's modern-day story as a framing device. The historical sequences are told as Eloise imagines them, producing a number of unrealistic—albeit amusing—linguistic anachronisms. It's doubtful that a nineteenth-century would-be rapist would utter "Come on! You know you want me!" to his prey. It's equally dubious that members of Britain's most elite corps of spies would refer to the Assistant Minister of Police's personal interrogation room as the "extra-special torture chamber."


Similarly anachronistic is the lack of decorum displayed by the novel's female characters. Amy paces up and down the deck of a ship staffed by drunken sailors in only her slip, and arranges a clandestine midnight meeting in the Jardin du Luxembourg with the man she's sure is the Purple Gentian. Part of this can be ascribed to Amy's naivete, which at times borders on idiocy, but her utter lack of propriety is mirrored in the behavior of her peers. Toward the novel's end, Richard's younger sister, Henrietta, emerges from her bed chamber wearing only a "diaphanous" nightgown into a room filled with several of her brother's friends. It's enough to give Jane Austen an aneurysm.


There's plenty to poke fun at in The Pink Carnation. Considering his reputation as Britain's most mercilessly efficient spy, the Purple Gentian proves to be utterly inept once Amy arrives on the scene. Perhaps it's because he's besotted with her and, admittedly, preventing her from meddling her way into danger is a full-time job, but it's hard to believe that a spy who falls for the most obvious traps could be England's last hope at stemming a French invasion.


But it's not fair to judge Willig's work with the same scrutiny as bonafide historical fiction. Hers is mass-market fiction, pure and simple, and while it can be inane at times, it's also deliciously fun. Perhaps because they're such a vital part of our education, we tend to view books in an all-or-nothing light: we either praise them as literature or dismiss them as trash. Then, as soon as we are done ridiculing Nora Roberts, we run off to watch the latest episode of Grey's Anatomy. I, personally, was so enthralled by The Pink Carnation that I completely forgot to get my weekly Grey's fix. Value is relative to a book's intended purpose; here, the purpose is to entertain. In the same vein, Willig's newest book, The Deception of the Emerald Ring, was released on November 16th. And a few weeks from now, I know I'll put aside my stodgy Austen criticism to read her newest tale of "extra-special torture chambers," bumbling heroines, and not-so-secret agents.
