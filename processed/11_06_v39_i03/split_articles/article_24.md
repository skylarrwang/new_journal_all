ix children come to "Live Like a Celt Day." That number dwindles to five when one boy complains that the traditional costume thrust upon him is too scratchy. Attendance, however, does not seem to concern Cyril. He blows his horn to gather the modest crowd now outfitted in tunics and face paint for a nature walk along the outskirts of the yard. ''Station. One," set up along the embankment of a drainage ditch, depicts the Celtic reverence for streams and salmon. Cyril shows a computer printout of a fish to the kids. "Does anyone know what the salmon meant to the Celts?" Connor, a homeschooled eight-year-old who just finished studying ancient Irish history, has the correct answer: "Knowledge." 

Moving on to the next stage of the walk, Cyril explains the importance of animals to the Celtic tribes. "Can anyone spot the fox in the woods?'' he asks, motioning towards the thorny underbrush. "I see,,, calls Connor, pointing into the woods where Stanley has set up a cardboard replica of a fox. After congratulating Connor, Cyril remarks that wolves used to live in the Connecticut woods, but became largely extinct due to hunting. "Is there a fake wolf?'' asks a little blonde girl with glasses, scanning the forest intently. 

As the group arrives on the far end of the lawn, Cyril begins to lead the children into the trees. "Be on the lookout for raiders,,, he warns portentously. Several tense seconds pass before Lawrence bursts forth from the leaves, waving a stic~ and roaring. A little girl screams. "Kill 'em all," bellows the faux-barbar-ian, charging from his hideout. "We'll enslave the children and kill the rest!,, Cyril ushers the children from the underbrush and runs with them into the yard. His prey out of reach, Lawrence pivots and lumbers dejectedly back into the woods . 

Once the children have caught their breath, the lesson continues. Cyril explains that for Celts, the wheel was a symbol for war. "Does anyone think they know why?'' he asks. Connor's hand shoots up. "Maybe because they thought war was a cycle that never ended and always kept happening," he says. Cyril looks to the adults mingling on the outskirts of the parking lot: "We've got a philosopher here." He had always thought it was because the Celts rode chariots into battle. 

In the meantime, ·· Betty has prepared bowls of oatmeal to demonstrate how the Celts might have made crackers. As the kids sit on a concrete ledge facing the grill, she arranges her cooking utensils and describes the history of classic Irish cuisine. ''Behold the ancient Celtic Tupperware," she announces, producing a plastic container full of biscuits from a nearby box and placing it before her audience. The children, apparently less concerned with learning the process than eating lunch, pound oatmeal into paste and shake mason jars filled with cream. "We don't know how the Celts actually made butter," whispers Cyril to Dan, "But this is fun for the kids." 

As one little girl peruses the stack of Celtic-themed coloring books for sale, her mother asks Cyril how she can pay him for his services. "Pay me?" the robed educator laughs. "Pay me in cattle, of course."'
