Pick up a sword and shield it's "Live Like a Celt Day." 
By Ben Lasman 
t's nine a.m. on a frigid Saturday morning, and 
Cyril May cannot find his cow horn. The bony-
faced, pony-tailed director of Yale Recycling and 
co-founder of the Celtic Learning Project hurls 
jagged spearheads, tore necklaces, and homemade leath-
er buckles across a frosty lawn in an attempt to locate 
the errant bovine accessory. "Cattle were very impor-
tant to the Celts,'' he says, brandishing a Beanie Baby 
bull and mooing for emphasis. "This is what they used 
for currency." 

At the Ancient Order of Hibernian's Hall in Me-
riden, Connecticut, Cyril and his fellow volunteers-
mostly middle-aged, bundled in layers of polar fleece 
and traditional tartan tunics 
arrange artifacts and 
shirts in preparation for the arrival of local families at 
today's ''Live Like a Celt Day,~' an event intended to 
teach children about the Celtic tradition. Hibernian's 
Hall, dull gray and plastered with bulletins for upcom-
ing poker nights and potluck suppers, evokes a mutated 
Winnebago, its rooms jutting out at unpredictable an-
gles. The half-wilted lawn is strewn with primitive ac-
coutrements and bordered by squat, tarp-strewn sheds. 
In the parking lot around back, a battered dumpster has 
been proudly pasted with a glittery shamrock. Today's 
event marks the first official collaboration between the 
Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic frater-
nal society established in 1565, and the Celtic Learning 
Project. Yet, despite its obsession with history, none of 
its members knows when the Celtic Learning Project 
began. "We started organizing sometime in the past five 
or ten years," offers Betty, one of the group's founders. 

The members are here today thanks to Cyril. ''He 
came down here one night to tell a story," remembers 
Stanley, a fellow member of the Order dressed in a green 
Jets sweatshirt and covered in blue face-paint, "and I 
thought it would be great to have him do something 
like that for the kids." Although performing Celtic tales 
ovember 2006 
comprises a large portion of the Learning Project's ac-
tivities, Cyril often has to edit the legends for younger 
audiences: "These stories aren't rated X," he says. "But 
they are usually rated R." 

. Dan, a blacksmith affiliated with the Ancient Celt-
ic Clans reenactment group, woke at five this morning 
to make the three-hour drive from his home in upstate 
New York. His day of living like a Celt begins with 
building an open tent on the grass and hollowing out 
a shallow divot in the earth to act as his furnace. He 
cradles a tiny iron cube in his calloused hands. "That's 
my anvil," he says, resting the lump atop a log jammed 
vertically into the ground, "The Celts liked it because 
it was highly portable." 

A specialist in what he calls "experimental archae-
ology,'' Dan meets with fellow enthusiasts weekly. Us-
ing items disinterred from excavations as models, the 
blacksmith and his assistants painstakingly recreate 
artifacts from scratch, producing functional and accu-
rate facsimiles for use in re-enactments and artisanal 
demonstrations. According to Dan, when anthropolo-
gists discovered a carnax, or centuries-old horn, in an 
Irish bog, a Scottish trombonist spent an estimated 
10,000 pounds constructing a working model of the 
instrument. "We'd love to get one of those," Dan says, 
a wistful expression crossing his face. 

As the Society's resident artist, Betty specializes 
in fabricating its painted shields and wire neckbands. 
"Once, we painted figures of Boudicca and Cuchullin 
with the faces cut out so kids could get their photo-
graphs taken," she recalls. "They like that male-female 
thing." While there is no comparable setup at today's 
event, Betty has devised an equally compelling assort-
ment of interactive stations to teach the many facets of 
antediluvian Celtic existence: "The Fort," a trampo-
line-sized, waist-high ring draped in cloth and flanked 
by a tninute, wooden loom, borders the concrete park-
