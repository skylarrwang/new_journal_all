kitchen, Yale workers · are also 
missing Silliman. 

To be sure, they insist, there is 
much to commend at their new out-
posts. Calhoun's "hounies" have 
· warmed up to Emile, who cleans 
entryways C, D, and E. Some have 
discovered . that the native Haitian 
speaks French, and they practice 
with her each morning. Ricky now 
• 
cleans Morse, and he finds his new 
job a little bit easier; it seems that 
Morsels steal few~r cups than Silli-
manders, so Ricky doesn't have to 
constantly carry them back to the 
dining hall. Jeanne, who supervised 
Emile and Ricky when they worked 
in Silliman, is happy to spend more 
time in Timothy Dwight, getting to 
know the students there. And while 
Tony misses "Jeannie," whom he 
. 
-
calls one of the best bosses he's 
ever had, he's really pleased with 
Kirsta, his new supervisor: "She's a 
peach," he says. 


Still, they miss it. "I miss ev-
erything about . Silliman," 
says 
Tony, his eyes magnified by his 
thick glasses. Now 71 years old, he 
spent the last nine of those years 
cleaning Silliman's entryways A, B, 
and C. He particularly misses the 
courtyard's squirrels, whom he had 
gradually befriended (with the help 
of peanuts) by the end of his first 
year at Silliman. ''It was a ritual for 
me 
every day," he says, adding 
that a three-pound bag of nuts from 
Stop & Shop would last him only a 
week and a half. The squirrels grew 
so used to Tony, they could recog-
nize him at a distance swarming 
him even when he wasn't in uni-
form and he could even recognize 
some of them. "One had half an 
ear," Tony reminisces. "He was the 
smartest one." 

It seems that the squirrels have 
also been displaced by the construc-
tion. When the renovation first be-
gan, Tony saw a squirrel hurry by, 
carrying what he thought was a rat 
in its mouth. When he looked clos-
er, Tony realized that it was a baby 
squirrel. The mother squirrel, star~ 
tled by the noise of the drills, had 
decided to abandon her home in 
Silliman. She carefully moved three 
of her babies, one at a time, from a. 
tree in the courtyard to one outside 
the Wall Street · gate 
away from 
. the noise of drills and hammers. 


As Tony packs up a ·vacuum 
cleaner in Berkeley's south court-
yard, a wistful expression crosses 
his face. There are a few squirrels 
who run around the courtyard 
here, he says, but it's not the same. 
"I fed a couple of them, but they'-re 
not used to me." 

Though separated from his 
squirrels, Tony is at least able to 
reunite with his former co-work-
ers on occassion: he helps Emile 
empty the trash every _ morning in 
Calhoun. "We all stay in touch," 
says Ricky. They visit each other 
on breaks; sometimes meeting on 
Broadway. Tyrese, who is cur-
rently recovering from an opera-
tion on his knee, calls Ricky every 
day. Monique, who recently had 
hip surgery, speaks regularly with 
Roseanne, who keeps in touch with 
Nicole over in Timothy Dwight 
and Alice over in Branford. 


Stu, too, paid Alice a visit last 
week. As Silliman's head chef, a po-
sition he rose to over his 23 years 
of cooking in its kitchen, Stu would 
say he misses the college most of all. 
He's honored to have been invited 
by Master Krauss to cook for Silli-
manders in Commons each Thurs-
day, but says that this once-a-week 
glimpse of his former community 
makes him miss it all the more. He 
wears his Silliman hat to work every 
day, with "CHEF STU'' stitched 
on the back, and he just had a new 
cap made. Do his Morse-Stiles col-
leagues think that, months into his 
employment at another kitchen, 
he ought to leave the hat at home? 
"None of them would ask me to do 
that," he says immediately. "They 
know I'm a Sillimander." 

They all miss the students, too. 
Stu remembers teaching Karen how 
to brew her own beer. Roseanne re-
members how she'd save grapes for 
Isaac when she knew he'd be com-
ing to dinner late. Emile, a devout 
Catholic, remembers praying each 
morning with Aaron, a devout Jew. 
She wants him to become a rabbi, 
or a lawyer~ or, better yet, both. 

Mostly, though, they miss 
each other. "It's more or less a 
family," says Ricky. "When you 
got a problem, it's their problem, 
too." He puts the finishing touch-
es on a sink in a top-floor bath-
room in Morse. "I like it here," he 
says, then his voice softens · "but 
I want to go home."
