these seeds. So when the seeds come 
out, they all breed and start .moving. 
It's the biggest . migration outside

Illegal logging of canopy trees, 
however, interferes with this natu-
ral system. Using field studies and 
satellite images, Curran has shown 
that, from 1985 to 2001, Kaliman-
tan's protected lowland forests 
shrank by more than fifty percent. 

Since fewer trees are left to produce 
the newly fallen seeds, the pigs' 
feasting curbs the forests' regenera-
tion. "I've been blessed and cursed 
in a way," she explains, "because for 
the first six or eight years, I was in 
a beautiful national park, just bath-
ing in the river in a remote place 
that was absolutely beautiful. Then 
later on, I started to see the place 
getting destroyed." 

ost of this devastation oc-
curred under the regime of 
Haji Mohammad Suharto, Indo-
nesia's notorious former president, 
who resigned in 1998 after three 
years of civil unrest. ~~If you think of 
Mobutu or Marcos or Baby Doc," 
Curran says, ''They're like chump 
change compared to this guy." 

Since Suharto's resignation and 
the forests' decline, the government 
has found an alternative source 
of capital in oil palm trees. Palm 
oil 
an ingredient used in products 
from Godiva chocolate to Nabisco 
crackers 
generates revenue for an 
economy in need of a marketable 
resource. But Curran dislikes the 
degree of industrialization neces-
sary to extract palm oil. She de-
scribes the current situation: "Say 
• 
you lived there. You have your own 
farms, and you have coffee and rub-
ber, and you're doing okay in your 
village of two hundred nouseholds. 
The bulldozer shows up, and these 
guys take all your land. You have 
no legal means of recourse." She 
shakes her head. "The regime gives 
you two hectares, and you plant

this oil palm. The regime owns it, 
and you owe them loans. Essen-
tially they're taking self-sufficient 
people and turning them into in-
dentured servants." 

As her research acquired a more 
political tone, Curran began to pub-
licize her results with · the hope of 
inducing social reform. Since her 
first paper was published in Science 
in 1999, numerous groups, such as 
the Rainforest Action Network and 
Greenpeace, have applied her find-
ings to their own environmental 
campaigns. Logging in Kalimantan, 
while disastrous, serves as an exam-
ple that might rescue the Amazon 
from a similar fate. Unfortunately, 
it is too late to save the Kalimantan 
forests, as Curran recognized the 
connection between the two phe-
nomena after the forests had begun 
to disappear. 

Curran's white skin and auburn 
hair clearly mark her as a foreigner 
in Indonesia, but she has managed to 
earn acceptance overseas. "Because 
Kalimantan is on the outskirts and 
Jakarta and the capital cities are not, 
I learned to speak in the backwaters 
of Indonesia. rm always teased that 
I speak like a local hick." She doesn't 
mind the teasing; she believes a sense 
of humor has helped her blend in. 

One presentation that Curran gave 
to an Indonesian audience solicited 
a slew of laughs when she called one 
of her tools a "seed trap." After she 
was done, she learned why every-
one had chuckled 
"seed trap" is 
Indonesian slang for male genitalia. 
"It's good because it's self-deprecat-
ing," she says. '~You learn in Asian 
culture that you don't brag· about 
yourself. You make funny com-
ments to put yourself lower, so it 
. works very well." 

In a dangerous field like .Cur-
ran's, it's helpful to have a trustwor-
thy crew. To select the students she 
invites on her trips, Curran says, "I 
take people out for a beer. Sense of 
humor is important. Patience is an-
other big deal because in Indonesia, 
you hurry up and wait a lot. It helps 
if you have a little zen." 

This zen helps Curran prevent 
Indonesia's culture of corruption 
from interfering with her research. 
Kabir Peay, a graduate student who 
worked with Curran in Kalimantan, 
remembers an occasion when their 
group was held against its will at a 
palm oil processing plant. "The eve-
ning we arrived," he recalled, "four 
large men · arrived at the plantation 
we were staying at and claimed 
we had broken adat, local law, by 
crossing their village grounds with-
out stopping to pay respects to the 
village head." Holding Curran hos-
tage, the men threatened to expel 
the group and confiscate its scien-
tific equipment. But Curran spent 
hours speaking with them in In-
donesian to negotiate a bargain 
that would enable the group to stay 
and conduct research. "There are 
not many other people that could 
have sat in that room, calmly smok-
ing clove cigarettes and negotiating 
in a foreign language with a group 
of dangerous men that wanted to 
hold us hostage," Peay noted. "~But 
Lisa was able to keep it together and 
do exactly that."
