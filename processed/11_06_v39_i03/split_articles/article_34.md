Movements
from
"The
Falun
Standing Stance" and "Penetrating
the Two c ·ostnic Extremes,', to
"The Great Heavenly Circuit," and
"Strengthening Divine Powers" are
designed to unite their energies with
the cosmos.

alun Gong combines meditation
with a unique form of cosmol-
ogy rooted in traditional Chinese
belief systems. The practice was
introduced to China in 1992 by Li
Hongzhi, a trumpet player and for-
mer army officer, who outlined his
essential teaching in Zhuan Falun,
or, in English, Revolving the Law
Wheel. In this collection of nine lec-
tures and essays, Li claims he was
tutored by a long line of Buddhist
and Daoist masters in qigong
an
ancient Chinese form of mind-body
meditation designed to redirect the
34
flow of qi throughout the body. Li
also claims to have gained the abil-
ity to levitate and walk through
walls. Falun Gong,s ultimate goal
is the improvement of the mental,
physical, and spiritual health of its
practitioners . . Members of Falun
Gong, however, believe that Master
Li brought a significantly different
element to qigong practice. When
Li introduced the movement, he
claimed that he was not founding a
new religion but reviving an ancient
set of practices. The . movemenes
official website, falundafa.org, de-
scribes Falun Gong as "originating
in pre-historic China.,,

"The basic foundations of Fa-
.
lun Gong are in qigong," explains
Gareth Fischer, a post-doctoral re-
searcher in the East Asian Studies
Department and a visiting instruc-
tor in anthropology. "But as you
get more deeply involved this other
stuff starts getting put on top of it."
Originally, much of qigong
practice possessed a religious or cos-
mological element. It was only dur-
ing the Cultural Revolution of the .
1960s, when Mao Zedong actively
suppressed traditional Chinese re-
ligions, that the form of medita-
tion more strongly emphasized the
physical component.

"In traditional practices, like
Tai,chi," says Wang, "the practice
was passed down from teacher to
student, and they w:orked at open-
ing one meridian at a time. It might
take 15 or 20 years for a practitio-
ner to open all their meridians. In
Falun Gong, you begin by opening
all of your meridians with the first
"

"Many practitioners turn to
Falun Gong because of health rea-
sons," says Fischer. Fischer does
not _practice Falun Gong himself,
but over the summer of 2000, while
completing his Ph.D. at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, he studied its
practitioners in Hong Kong. Since
1999, it has been illegal to practice,
or even research, the movement in

mainland China.

"It is a very physical practice,"
he says. "No different from lifting
weights at the gym." Li intended for
the practice to be painful at first. It
involves a series of highly specified
poses held for a long period: Fischer,
who tried the practice with follow-
ers in Hong Kong, admits that they
can "make you really sick." This
process of sustained poses is called
qingli · shenti, or "cleaning of the
self." Li and his followers believe
that by enduring the pain of diffi-
cult meditation, they can eliminate
impure karma.

"Once they see the practice
works, they tend to get drawn into
the cosmology."

At its core, Falun Gong sees
qigong as a vehicle for attaining
Zhen-Shan-Ren, or ''Truthfulness,
Compassion
and
Forbearance."
These three principles, Falun Gong
maintains, underlie the workings of
the universe: It is because of man's
natural corruption that humanity
suffers the illnesses and hardships of
the physical world.

he doctors who practice at Yale
claim that Falun Gong offers
not only the path to health, but alsQ
the key to rediscovering one's true
form
what Li refers to as the yu-
ansheng. He says it will allow one
to see past the "special dimension"
that has been constructed around
human ignorance to one of ten
other dimensions, where the "law
wheel," or Falun, exists. "Li be-
lieves that in every person there is
a wheel," explains Fischer, "that has
been installed in the abdomen, but
that exists in another dimension."
This wheel is supposed to move in
tune with the Milky Way, the cos-
mos, and the various rhythms of the
universe, but stress inflicted upon
it by wordly life destroys this syn-
chronicity. This is where meditation
comes in; the tranquil exercises wit-
nessed on Cross Campus are an ef-
fort to realign one's individual wheel
with that of the cosmos.

Although Li claims that Falun
Gong has ancient origins, its phi-
losophy of degeneration and puri-
fication m ay have more recent ·so-
ciological roots. Falun Gong comes
from urban mainland China, where
recent developments in Chinese
society
rapid
industrialization,
large-scale environmental degrada-
tion, and the removal of social sup-
port and w elfare institutions
have
contributed to a general feeling of
•
corruption.

In Fischer's eyes, "people left
out of rapid social change" are
attracted by
what Falun Gong
promises.

he practice has brought a fair
amount of controversy to Yale's
campus. Last April, as Chinese Pres-
ident Hu Jintao delivered a speech
to a packed audience at Sprague Me-
morial Hall, scores of Falun Gong
practitioners who had come from as
far as Australia m editated in protest
on the New H aven Green, holding
bright yellow banners proclaim-
ing "Falun D afa is Good." Across
the street, C hinese students and
Communist Party members, some
of whom had been bussed up from
New York, hoisted
~ed Chinese
flags in support of their country's
government. Alternating between
Chinese and English, the two groups
berated each other through dueling
megaphones.

The streets surrounding campus
were postered with rraphic photos.
Protesters demonstrated live re-
enactments of torture. Since 1999,_
the movement has been banned
in China and actively suppressed
by the government, which denies
that it has committed any human
rights violations in its handling of
Falun Gong. But many claim that
those who refuse to recant their
beliefs are tortured, sometimes to
death, by government authorities.
F alundafa.org alleges that over two
thousand practitioners have died in
custody. Some also claim that the
government harvests the organs of
Falun Gong disciples to sell on the
black market.

The day before Hu's speech,
the Yale Falu n Gong Club had
drawn up a petition with over
2,500 signatures requ esting that
President Levin raise the issue of the

ecause Falun Gong has no tem-
ple, clergy, or official member-
ship, the movement is based mainly
on local informal groups like this
one. It spreads largely through word
of mouth and communication over
the internet. ccWe contact each other
mainly by e-mail," Deng explains.
((There is no other network, no hi-
erarchy." Compared to similar clubs
around the world, whose member-
ship can reach into the hundreds
or thousands, the Yale Falun Gong
Club is relatively small. Deng esti-
mates that there are between seven
and ten committed practitioners in
the Yale community at any given
time,. as well as a shifting population
of other casual observers.

At Yale, as elsewhere, the group
is centered around regular medita-
tion and weekly "experience shar-
ing" sessions, in which practitio-
ners meet to read and study the
movement's central text and discuss
the ways in which Falun Gong has
changed their lives. For most of
the members, this change has been
largely health related.

Lu, the immunobiology re-
searcher, was introduced to the
movement by her parents in 2000.
Her mother, suffering from heart
disease and cerebral arteriosclerosis,
turned to Falun Gong. ccAt first we
all thought my mother was super-
stitious," Lu says. After a string of
unsuccessful research projects and a
difficult childbirth~ -Lu "followed her
mother's example.

Among the group's core mem-
hers, Wang, who emigrated from
China's Sichuan Province when he
was ten years old, is the only under-
graduate. "I was a very sick child,
even in China," he said. When he
moved to Boston, he was hospital-
ized for an ulcer. His father, a re-
searcher in cardiology at Harvard
who had been suffering from a neu-
rological disease known as progres-
sive spinal muscular atrophy, intro-
duced him to Falun Gong. ''Every
doctor in China told [my father] he
had five years to live, maximum," re-
ports Wang. "He wanted to try the
United States, but it was the same
