Building a wall around education. 
by Amy Rothschild 
sk Chris Alexander about the problem with Ster-
ling Memorial Library, and he'll point her out. 
'<There she is 
the lady who hassles us," he whis-
pers, as a uniformed guard with hair as shiny as her shoes 
struts into the farthest alcove of the library and narrows 
her eyes on the six computers open to 'non-Yalies. Few 
students know that she is a key actor in a quiet drama 
playing out on the lamp-lit stage of Sterling. According 
to Alexander, who comes to the library for a quiet respite 
after a workday as a roofer, this guard has explicitly stated 
that it is unfair for students, who pay so much money 
to attend Yale, to be forced to share library access with 
the broader New Haven community. uThere are signs 
November 2006 
all over the place saying you can use the computer 
for twenty minutes," he says. u After fifteen minutes, 
she's asking you to leave.'' 

On August 2Jrd, the administration posted fly-
ers announcing that, starting September 6th, entry 
would be <<restricted to persons with current Yale 
University or Library issued identification cards, 
Sunday through Friday after 6 p.m.'' From this 
hour until closing, bookworms entering the library 
must slide a Yale ID through a groove on the side 
of the stainless steel turnstile under the watch of a 
uniformed guard. For the privileged few, the ma-
chine beeps, flashes a light, and then lowers its met-
al arms. It sounds like a robot regurgitating, and ies 
equally personable. 

According to Danuta Nitecki, the associate uni-
versity librarian for public services, the contraption 
cost the University thousands of dollars. Nitecki, 
who has the warm ~emeanor of a grade-school li-
brarian, says that the expensive scanner is part of 
an experiment in preparation for the re-opening 
of Cross Campus · Library, where 
similar scanners may one day grace 
the underground entrance. 
Ni-
tecki stresses that, though every ef-
fort is made to extend resources to 
the New Haven community to 
what she terms cc researchers in the 
world" Sterling and CCL are not 
· public libraries. (Yale houses its col-
lection of government documents, 
which is available to the general 
public by federal law, far from cen-
tral campus, in the Seeley G. Mudd 
Library on Mansfield Road.) 

In previous years, CCL not only 
opened its doors indiscriminately, 
but also furnished some two-dozen 
computer stations with unrestricted 
internet access. Last year, library 
patrons complained about limited 
seating and computer availability. 
The staff receives so few complaints 
that, Nitecki says, ccwe take them to 
heart." As a result, library admin-
istrators placed further limitations 
on access during the evening hours, 
when more students traffic in and 
out of the library. 

But even before the clock strikes 
six, some guards stringently enforce 
the twenty minute policy. On a Fri-
day afternoon, New Haven resident 
J eraya, 16, finds herself booted from 
MySpace despite the .fact that two-
12 
thirds of the computers idle, ready 
for any student or cc researcher in 
the world" to claim. A guard with 
a large, soft . face frantically treads 
back and forth in the nave, like a toy 
car gaining traction. He stands over 
Jeraya, spitting <<Supervisor!'' into 
his walkie-talkie. When J eraya must 
finally trade MySpace for some 
space outside, the guard turns and 
sighs to a librarian on duty. ccBoy, is 
she trouble." 

cci knew it was going to hap-
pen," New Haven resident Jim 
Moore said of his recently restricted 
access. The once-homeless Moore, 
who currently volunteers at the 
Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen, 
has fr-equented Yale's central librar-
ies for years; he prefers them to the 
New Haven Public Library, where 
teenagers gather after school to 
trade gossip and obscenities, and 
where computer users have always 
faced time restrictions. He foresaw 
that the closing of Cross Campus 
Library might include not only the 
building itself, but also its policy 
of allowing _members of the public 
like himself to use the computers 
to conduct research, check e-mail, 
or play cards on gatning sites into 
the early· morning. Although out-
side users usually follow proper 
library conduct, there have been 
times when Yale Security or the 
University Police were summoned 
to ask individuals engaging in dis-
ruptive behavior such as creating 
too much noise or looking at por-
nography to leave. «The homeless 
have ruined it for themselves," says 
Mike, another formerly homeless 
Yale library-user. «We're not all an-
gels," he admits. 

Nitecki argues that, especially 
with the renovations, there is sim-
ply too great a demand for library 
resources. Installations such as the 
ID scanner are not unique to Yale, 
she points out. ccM y impression is 
that among the Ivy Leagues, we are 
the most open." Indeed, access to 
Columbia and Harvard's main li-
braries hinges on a University ID. 
«I'ffi very comfortable that we are 
still generous," she says. <'Eight 
thirty to six p.m. is quite a bit 
of time." 

These hours do not irnpress 
Gregory Morton, a member of the 
Class of 2000 who deplores the 
changes. He called last year's open 
library access ccone of Yale's best 
contributions to the city." Current-
