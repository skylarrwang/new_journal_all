mid the din of the construction site on Cross 
Campus and the whirl of students rushing from 
class to class, Min Deng and her companions are 
finding inner peace. Notes of traditional Chinese mu-
sic waft from a small tape recorder, competing with the 
roar of heavy machinery, as the group moves in unison

graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, the 
group meets on Cross Campus to practice what it 
calls "mind-body cultivation." "I try to do the prac-

in dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and 
the group's president. "It keeps me much calmer,
