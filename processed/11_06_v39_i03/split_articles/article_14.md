Native Speakers

IN A CHINESE I I 5 CLASS, THE 
at-
mosphere among the ten students is 
generally one of camaraderie in the 
struggle to learn a new language. 
There is, however, one student who 
interferes with the laid-back tone. 
When the professor asks questions 
that stump the other students, Lind-
say speaks up. At other times, she 
seems bored, rubbing her eyes. When 
other students struggle over a tricky 
phrase, Lindsay breaks in, correcting 
their pronunciation. In a word, she 
makes things ... uncomfortable. 


Whether out of cultural fascina-
tion or practical business aspirations, 
more and more students are flocking 
to Chinese language classes. But as 
the East Asian Studies Department 
expands its course offerings, it is 
having trouble deciding what to do 
with students like Lindsay 
stu-
dents of Chinese heritage who can 
speak the language to some extent, 
but lack significant exposure to its 
written form. 


Yale has restructured its Chinese 
program in response to this and oth-
er problems. Following a series of 
meetings in the summer of 2005, the 
university adopted a new placement 
test for students with some Chinese 
experience. Based on test results, the 
.. department places introductory lev-
el students in either Chinese 115, for 
students with no experience, or Chi-
nese 118, for students who, accord-
ing to the course description, "have 
had varying degrees of exposure to 
Chinese in a family or other setting." 


Yale emphasizes that the courses in 
October 2006 
this "separate track" are "not more 
'advanced' than those designed for 
students with no background in 
Chinese but rather address a· differ-
ent set of needs." Chinese 115 pro-
vides elementary language .skills to 
students with no previous exposure 
to the language, with particular at-
tention to pronunciation and speak-
ing. Chinese 118, on the other hand, 
is designed for students with some 
background in the language and fo-
cuses on literacy. 


Yale's new program has its 
kinks. 
Some students, like Lind-
say, have ended up in 115 when 
118 would be more appropriate. In 
Lindsay's case, a scheduling conflict 
prevented her from taking 118, but 
some other students 
disparagingly 
called "sleepers" by t4eir peers-
have been known to mask their lan-
guage abilities in order to succeed 
in less challenging classes and coast 
through language requirements. 


The problems multiply in the 
intermediate and advanced courses. 
After one year of language study, 
the department merges the two 
tracks in the hope that both sets of 
students will be able to work to-
gether at a similar level. However, 
many non-heritage students report, 
that the departmenes plan is some-
what naive. Scott Cohen, · an East 
~ 
Asian Studies major now enrolled in 
an advanced course on Chinese film, 
sits alongside classmates with more · 
oral competence in the language. 
While he may score well on written 
assignments, he still lacks the mas-
tery many native speakers possess 
and has come to the conclusion that 
"you just can't worry about your 
grades." He remains enthusiastic 
about the language, but finds study-
ing it increasingly frustrating. "It's 
enormously hard to articulate opin-
ions and arguments," he explains. 
"I come home really upset some-
times. 


While Cohen has stuck with it, 
many others have abandoned the 
language altogether. Marisa Reis-
man, a junior who recently stopped 
taking · Chinese, found that there 
was too much variety in the experi-
ence levels of students in her classes. 
After two years of study and a sum-
mer in China, she found it almost 
impossible to follow the language 
at a level comparable to that of stu-
dents with backgrounds in Chinese. 
Reisman feels that the Yale program 
is impossible to navigate for a stu-
dent attempting to learn the lan-
guage from scratch. "If you just go 
through the Yale program," without 
visiting China, she says, "you would 
crash and burn.'' 


Still, some Chinese-heritage stu-
dents insist learning Chinese is not 
simple for anyone. 
Lissa Yu originally attempted 
to take an upper-level class, assum-
ing her heritage and speaking ability 
would qualify her for its demands. 
Instead, she wound up "bombing" 
the first test and dropping down to 
Chinese 118. She admits her back-
ground gave her some advantage in 
the class, but she argues, "Every-
one had some knowledge and, for 
those who didn't, you knew what 
you were getting into.'' Further-
more, Yu points out that her own 
abilities should not be overrat-
ed though she is a native speaker, 
she speaks Chinese "like a four-
year-old." 


Besides, Yu suggests that non-
heritage students can also learn a 
valuable lesson in their classes 
the 
feeling of suddenly finding yourself 
in a minority culture. "If you're un-
comfortable," she advises, "consider 
how I grew up."
