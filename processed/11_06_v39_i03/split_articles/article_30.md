EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Giuseppe was at home on 
Linden Street in New Ha-
ven's East Rock neighbor-
hood . when Romeo called. He left 
his house and raced toward Orange 
Street. As he neared "Romeo and 
Giuseppe's," the gourmet Italian 
grocery store he and Romeo had 
run together for over a decade, he 
could see Romeo standing outside. 
Giuseppe knew that figure by heart. 
It was the man he had spent every 
day with for the last 14 years: his 
countryman from the fields of Italy, 
his companion in pre-dawn trips to 
New York's produce markets. All 
of the dealings with nasty distribu-
tors, the firing of unruly employees, 
the lifting of crates, the arranging of 
food displays, the placating of un-
happy customers, the sweeping of 
floors, came flooding back to him 
as he saw the hulking figure stand-
ing beneath the shop's white awning. 
Giuseppe came face to face with 
Romeo, and Romeo told his paisan, 
his kin, his partner, that Giuseppe 
had to go. Overnight, Romeo had 
changed the locks on the Store. 
''It took me right off my feet. 
I had nothing left," Giuseppe says. 
"Fourteen years of my life work. And 
the goals that I had always dreamed 
of when I was young. And finally, 
you know, suddenly,Â· 'boom!' It 
just shut off. I just went, you know, 
kind of blind. I locked myself into 
myself. I couldn't think of nothing 
more than revenge." 


I
t is 5:30 p.m. on the last day of 
October, and night has descended 
on New Haven. On Orange Street, 
between Humphrey and Bishop, the 
early darkness catches shoppers at 
Nica's Market off-guard: Is it dinner 
time already? A graduate student 
comparing two types of goat cheese 
throws both in his basket, a little 
boy in search of the perfect potato is 
scooped up by his mother, and two 
young employees at the back coun-
ter rush to fill demands for chicken 
piccatta, marinated olives, lasagna, 
and balls of fresh mozzarella. 
And there, standing next to the 
meat counter, beaming over the 
scene, is Giuseppe--or Joe, as he's 
known in the neighborhood. His 
face is sharp, bird-like: His nose 
juts out strongly; his eyes are dark 
and focused; his skin is taut; his 
mustache is perfectly pointed. In 
motion-and Giuseppe never stops 
moving-he radiates a warmth and 
exuberance that soften his harsh fea-
tures. He is fit, and when his name 
is shouted from the other end of the 
store, he darts off in its direction, his 
sing-song voice echoing through the 
aisles. Giuseppe is Nica's life force, 
and the store is his. While the long 
hours and stress of running an inde-
pendent grocery might damage the 
health of others, Giuseppe's happi-
ness seems directly proportionate to 
his level of industry. 
At a similar store a few blocks 
down the road, 14 years of history 
have been revised; the labels on the 
tomato sauce, the spice bottles, the 
olive oil, and the awning now read 
"Romeo and Cesare's." A blow-up 
black-and-white portrait of Romeo 
and Cesare has been affixed to the 
wall above the deli. Side by side in 
the picture, the brothers' doughy 
faces melt seamlessly into their necks, 
but where Cesare's soft features and 
wide brows convey a gentle, kind 
demeanor, Romeo's twinkling eyes 
and hard mouth offer a mischievous 
contrast. 
It is Romeo's day off. Outside 
the store, general manager Ben 
Minichino, a born schmoozer, rear-
ranges outdoor seating and greets 
customers. "What's up, boss?" he 
says to an old man wearing a sports 
jacket and a straw hat. Inside, Ce-
sare mans the register while a wom-
an holding an infant in a carrot cos-
tume consults a shopping list and a 
man fumbles for change to pay for a 
jar of sun-dried tomatoes. 
At dusk on Halloween, each 
store is completely self-involved, ig-
norant of the parallel scene playing 
out mere blocks away. The proximi-
ty of the two paisan, and their deter-
mination to ignore each other raises 
the question: What could ever have 
divided two lives so completely en-
twined? 
Although the story tore through 
the East Rock neighborhood at the 
time, the cause of the split remained 
obscured. Toni Dorfman, a Yale the-
ater studies professor and patron of 
Romeo and Giuseppe's, remembers 
returning from a trip to England to 
discover the schism. The account, 
she says, became more and more lu-
rid in the telling. "Something about
