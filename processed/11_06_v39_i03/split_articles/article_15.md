Plumbing the 
Depths 

SARAH STRONG IS 
A 
WESLEYAN 
graduate, a soon-to-be published 
poet, and according to a recent 
poll in The New Haven Advocate·-
the finest plumber in New Haven. 
If the combination surprises you, 
you're not alone. Even Strong her-
self is somewhat baffled. "If you had 
told me I was gonna be a plumber 
living in New Haven ... " she says, 
letting the sentence finish itself. 


Strong's story is an encourag-
ing one for Yale seniors whose post-
graduation plans are often nebulous 
and anxiety-inducing. In Strong's 
family there was precedent for job-
hopping and tradesmanship of the 
many jobs her. mother had, her fa-
vorite was a stint as a carpenter. As 
an aspiring actress in high school, 
the future plumber never had pipe 
dreams. Sure, she liked to tinker 
with things and didn't mind getting 
dirty, but the connections end there. 
Her resume is a smorgasbord of ca-
reers. She has been a bartender, a 
door-to-door canvasser, a teacher in 
a bilingual school, and an interpreter 
at a deaf school. 


Strong made her first foray into 
plumbing a little less than a decade 
ago when, while searching for a job 
that would allow her to continue 
writing poetry and fiction part-time, 
she accompanied her plumber boy-
friend on the job. Plumbing, though, 
is not a career one just falls into. It 
requires at least twice as many years. 
of preparation to become a licensed 
plumber as it does to become a li-
censed lawyer. It takes four years 
of apprenticeship, two years of . 
practice as a journeyman, and three 
multiple-choice exams to put the 
"skilled" in "skilled labor." But after 
her first day under the pipes Strong 
was "completely sold, end of dis-
cussion," and she quickly began the 
formal education that would secure 
her a license. Six years later, ·she 
founded Anchor Plumbing, LLC. 


Strong cites the paucity of 
women in the trades as the reason 
she never considered a plumbing 
career in her youth. Female trades-
men comprise about two percent 
of the skilled physical labor work 
force, and Strong guesses the .statis-
tic is even smaller in the ph.imbing 
industry. She also points to the pre-
vailing attitudes about tradesman-
ship. "A lot of people don't ever 
even think to consider a, job in the 
trades," says Strong. 


The poet-plumber shakes her 
head at the classist assumptions 
that cause many people to associ-
ate plumbing with a failure to earn a 
college degree. Strong, for one, has 
a B.A~ from Wesleyan. 


A college diploma and two X 
chromosomes aren't the only things 
that make her an unconventional 
plumber. "I don't want to perpetu-
ate the ·stereotype of the mechanic," 
she says. So she combats precon-
ceptions by being punctual to all 
appointments and returning phone 
calls promptly. The ''plumber butt" 
stereotype is less easily dismantled. 
"The tool belt is heavy," she says 
obliquely. 


Though it's easy to imagine how 
plumbing might influence Strong's 
writing a mechanical vocabulary 
or a propensity for bathroom scenes, 
for example she has written only 
a few pieces about her job. One, a 
poem, will be published in the up-
coming edition of The Cream City 
Review, The University of Wiscon-
sin's literary journal. Surprisingly, 
Strong claims that her work as a 
writer has actually had a greater ef-
fect on her work as a plumber than 
the other way around. The com-
munication skills and sensitivity to 
interpersonal relationships honed 
by her writing serve her daily in her 
life as a tradeswoman. They cer-
tainly didn't go unnoticed by read-
ers of New Haven's newspaper The 
Advocate, who voted in a in a fall 
2006 poll that Strong's business is 
the best of its kind in the Elm City. 


Despite prevailing stereotypes 
surrounding her primary line of 
work, Strong never second-guess-
es its value. "Working with your 
hands is grounding," says Strong. 
"It teaches you to be in the present 
moment." Strong relishes the grati-
fication that results from solving a 
problem not on a page, but in a pipe. 
"It's empowering," says Strong, a 
jill of all trades, unafraid to leave 
her ivory tower for the porcelain 
bowls. Though writing, not plumb-
ing, may seem more important to 
Yale students, Strong recognizes 
that plumbing is nearly as essential 
as the water coursing through the 
pipelines she repairs. After all, she 
says, "You need that toilet."
