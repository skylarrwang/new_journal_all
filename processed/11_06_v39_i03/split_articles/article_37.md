My day with the jury pool.
by fanny Dach
n the morning after Elec-
tion Day, I feel proud of
my country and proud
of its political processes. With the
House ours and the Senate on its
way, few of my fellow Democrats
feel they have cause to be unhappy.
One of them is John DeStefano,
who remains New Haven Mayor
rather than Connecticut Gover-
nor-Elect. I pass him in front of
City Hall as I wend through foggy
s~eets to join sixty or seventy of
my fellow citizens trickling through
a queue at the door of 235 Church
Street. No one in line, Democrat or
Republican, is happy. Shuffling one
by one past a magnetometer, our
limbs are frisked, our hats removed,
our camera phones confiscated, and
our jackets branded with stickers.
(Since 9/11, anyone caught in this
building without a small, white-
and-red sticker has been detained.)
Our harmlessness established, we
are corralled into an elevator and
taken up to a ninth-floor audito-
rium, where gray plastic seats face
a wood-paneled podium. In a large,
square room with white walls and
gray carpet, we wait. And wait. And
wait. Until. ..
''Good morning!"

The voice, ringing and conviv-
ial, tries to welcome the motley as-
sortment of New Haven Tesidents
to the County Courthouse, but
elicits no more than the grumbling,
half-hearted reply heard so often
by principals addressing middle
school assemblies. Chipper, pas-

sionate, and perplexed by our lack-
luster response, the voice belongs to
the · Honorable Jonathan Silbert, a
Connecticut Superior Court judge.
He goes on to offer some cajol-
ing words of encouragement: "You
should really be more enthusiastic
than that
this is jury duty!"
ew
would-be
jurors
share
Silbert's rosy perspective. In-
formed of n1y impending summons,
my friends spent the week before
November 8th telling me that rac-
ism is my best exit strategy. "Say
you were mugged by a black man on
Dixwell." "Say your family is from
Texas." "Say an episode of The Cos-
by Show traumatized you as a child
and the wounds have yet to heal."
Though my distress at Bill Cosby's
infamous threat against Theo (''I
brought you into this world, and I
can take you out") has long since
faded, the first two statements are
accurate enough. But the next logi-
cal steps
therefore, I am preju-
diced against African-Americans;
therefore; I am unfit to serve as an
impartial member of a jury simply
aren't true. How, then, can I avoid
what the sutnnlons I received in the
mail describes as "an obligation and
an honor"?
My mother the Texan
sug-
gests announcing that I trust the
police. "They always ask you if you
would believe the testimony of a
cop over that of an alleged critninal .
And I always say 'yes/ and they al-
ways push me, saying 'Really? Why

would you?' But I really believe
that. Our. house has been broken
into twice, and the police caught
the people· both times. Our car was ·
stolen, and, found by the police be-
fore we knew it 'Yas missing. One of
your au pairs dated that nice police-
F. h "
man, 1s er.
She's right; I trust the D.C. of-
ficers. With· their blue uniforms
and smiling faces, they protected
my childhood home from burglars
and watched out for me as I crossed
the streets to school. But I am reg-
istered to vote here in Connecticut;
so I have been summoned for jury
duty in New Haven, and I cannot
place my faith in a thin blue line
that seems crooked, inadequate, and
hateful of Yale.

I finally ignore all advice, enter-
ing the courthouse with one mea-
sly card up my sleeve: My aunt is
president of the Texas State Bar.
My apartment is furnished with
large, brass scales of justice from
her swearing-in, and I've heard that
lawyers don't like their jurors to
come from legal families.
s it tunis out, I am holding an
.. a.~.-~;;. my Yale ID. Though my
College Dean ignored two frantic
e-mails pleading for information
about some sort of scholastic ex-
emption, and though no one I spoke
with could remember hearing of an-
other summoned student, the ninth-
floor desk attendant is brisk and
knowledgable. She takes one look at
me, asks if I atn a full-time student,
and then says, "I'm going to send
you home, okay?" Just like that,
I am free to go, to finish my read-
ing while the men and women who
would other wise be at work must
spend hours listlessly waiting to be
chosen for a jury panel.
I'm off the hook. But as I turn
curiosity and an adult-sized helping
of guilt. Besides, it's eight a.m. and I
have nothing better to do until my
one o'clock class. So why not stay?
Fearing that the kindly atten-
dant will discover me and shoo me
away, I claim a chair in the . next-
to-last row. When a television is
wheeled to the front of the room,
I regret sitting so far back. Soaring
music and a flowing graphic of- the
U.S. Constitution replace the mus-
cled body builders of an infomercial
as a video starts to play. A voiceover
narrates the revolutionary struggles
before continuing with "the Pream-
ble and Sixth Amendment that, I'm
told, my forefathers died to secure:
"The accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial, by an
impartial jury of the state and dis-
trict wherein the crime shall have
been committed, which district shall
have been previously ascertained
by law ... " My forefathers spent the
American Revolution as Polish Jews
and Scottish landowners, not rebel-
lious colonists, but the next segtnent
of the video is more affecting. Build-
ings that served as fixtures of my
childhood flash across the screen-
the Capitol, the White House, the
Supreme Court and we are told
that, without our ''most direct and
vital" participation, these buildings
will crumble and fall. As a proud
Washingtonian, and as a voter who
recently exercised his civic rights, I
am struck by this prophecy. I feel
like a heel.
n case the video failed to stir us,
Jonathan Silbert is here to moti-
vate the jury pool in person. After
his rousing "good morning," he
launches right into it. "Experience
tells me that one or two
maybe
even three of you wish you were
somewhere else." He smiles jovially
as most in the audience nod their
heads. There by choice, but hoping
not to stand out, I grin weakly be-
fore pursing my lips and nodding.
Silbert describes voire dire, "an
old French phrase for 'to speak the
truth."' During the next part of the
process
the examination of pro-
spective jurors, under oath, by the
competing litigators we'll
need
to do just that. This grilling session
is where the wheat and chaff are
separated into dignified jurors and
shamed freemen, where so many
had urged me to paint a convincing
portrayal of racism or blind faith in
authority. A quick poll reveals that,
of the sixty or seventy members of
Wednesday's jury pool, half had
been summoned in the past and only
four of those had been accepted onto
jury panels. Silbert lays what he says
we ''may find a hard curse" on the
rest of us that we may be one of
the select few who "look back with
pride upon that as one of the most
important civic duties they have
ever performed or will ever perform
in their lives."
"Virtually without exception,"
he continues, "everyone who's had
the opportunity to actually sit on a
jury reports that it's been one of the
most valuable and rewarding things
they've done." My ears perk up-
whether at the promised rewards
or the selective application process
Yale students are bred to adore, it's
hard to say. When many are called
and few are chosen, the prospect of
being one of the elect is irresistible.
I consider asking to have my name
put back in the pool. Days :filled
with Dean's Excuses and spiritu-al
fulfillment are hard to pass up.
s I wind up, Silbert winds
down, signing off with a joke
about how he hopes the security
line at the door was shorter than the
one at the polls. (It wasn't. Not by a
long shot.) Unamused, the potential
jurors settle in for a long, quiet wait.
The experienced have brought lap-
tops and bagged lunches; the naive
must make do with a pile of B-list
magazines and a hurruning vending
· machine. Members of the jury pool
are at once friends, thrown together
by circumstance, and eneniies, hop-
ing the others will get picked. The
television is tuned to the Food Net-
work, which tortures those of us
not well-stocked for the day's haul,
then (per my request and to the an-
noyance of others) switches over to
CNN's constant, unwavering cov-
erage of the Virginia senate race.
Exploring away from the televi-
sion, I find a group of potential ju-
rors debating the merits of their re-
spective chicken coops. Elsewhere,
a small . Shih Tzu with a pink bow
between her ears is carried mysteri-
ously back and forth by court em-
ployees. A pet? Part of a K-9 unit?
Evidence?
To much of the jury pool, I am
more out of place than the dog. For
them, I, a Yale student, am a circus
animal. They laugh at my vocabu-
lary and stand by the windows,
pointing at various residential col-
leges. "Which one is that?" These
are not the tricks I came here to
perform, an~ it doesn't ~ake long
for the American flag waving in
my mind's eye to sag pathetically.
My dull, three-hour stay has given
me plenty of time to consider the
havoc such an obligation would
wreak on my class schedule and
vacation plans. I head dejectedly
for the door, trying to assuage my
second thoughts. I tell myself that
I helped the justice system merely
by showing up. I have experienced
town and gown for four hours, just
by placing a white circle on my
breast pocket. I anticipate placing
the sticker proudly on my wall. It.
labeled me: ''JUROR."
Yet, as I exit, the guards force
me to throw the sticker away. For
consolation, I ruminate on one of
Silbert's. remarks. "Not to worry,"
he had reassured the pool. "We
know who you are, we know where
you live, and, if we don't :find a case
for you today, we'll track you down
in a year or two and try again." In
my head, I start counting down
from 365.
