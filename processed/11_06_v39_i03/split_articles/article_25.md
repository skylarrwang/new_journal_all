n Indonesia, loggers have placed a five hundred dollar bounty on Professor Lisa Curran's head. 

Back in the U.S., however, she is viewed as a luminary rather than as a target. This year, she was awarded a MacArthur ''Genius Grant" five hundred thousand dollars to use for her work, no strings attached. 

Thanks to the grant, she can now afford to be caught by the loggers one thousand times. 

For the wanted woman, finding a place to sleep is the least of her worries in Indonesia; David Butman, one of Curran's students at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, recalls finding unconventional lodgings with the professor while hiking on a kuda kuda, or logging trail. ''Our beds consisted of empty rice bags slung between two poles just cut from the surrounding forest," he described. ''The sounds of Orangutans cast us off to sleep at night." The pair camped together while traveling through Kalimantan, the region of Indonesia that Curran has studied for 22 years. 

''I know the supply town in Indonesia better than I know where I live now," says Curran, a professor of tropical resources at Yale. In the second week of November, Curran will once again travel to Kalimantan. Before she leaves, she'll need new booster shots. ''But I don't get sick anymore," she insists. ''I've had it all." 

a few years ago, Curran discovered an interaction between two natural phenomena in Kalimantan. One of these occurrences, "masting," is a period of heightened seed production by the island's canopy trees that occurs every three to four years. The other event is the El Niiio Southern Oscillations, a climatic cycle that affects weather in the tropical Pacific. After studying both phenomena, Curran found that the canopy trees synchronized their seed production with this weather cycle, and that, because of this simultaneity, millions of wild pigs feast during years when El Niiio occurs. "These pigs are 150 kilos. They're huge, and they migrate over the landscape in search of
