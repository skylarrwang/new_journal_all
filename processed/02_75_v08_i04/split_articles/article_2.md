Several years ago, when women at 
Yale were still outnumbered ten to 
one, I attended a meeting at the 
Alumni House on involving more 
female graduates in alumniâ€¢func-
tions. Someone mentioned the Yale 
Club of New York, recounting how 
annoyed his wife always became be-
cause she was not allowed to eat in 
the dining hall at certain hours. My 
picket-pig-Mory's adrenalin started 
pumping. 


Then, a woman staff member of 
the Alumni House, who by her dress, 
make-up and polite deference to the 
director seemed to be his secretary, 
spoke for the first time all meeting. 
She said that she had entered the 
elevator at the Club one evening 
wearing a pants suit-she traced the 
imaginary creased flairs and long-
belted tunic-and was told by the 
operator that women were not allow-
ed in pants. "I won't take you up in 
those, lady.'' She calmly unzipped 
and removed her elegant bottoms, 
left them in a heap by the astonished 
attendant, and got off at her floor. 


We left the meeting together, talk-
ing about Yale's guilty, schizophren-
ic attitude toward women. On the 
one hand, the gallant-"Yes, we love 
women," as one French professor 
told me; on the other, "No, we won't 
admit them on an equal ratio with 
men." I found out later that this 
"secretary" was the assistant direc-
tor of the Alumni House. 


Since then, thi.ngs have changed. 
When I talk to undergraduates 
about ratios and quotas, they act as 
if I'm lecturing on ancient history. 
One sophomore told me how grateful 
she was to us pioneers who had gone 
before and made her life easier. And I 
no longer mistake assistant directors 
for secretaries. Women are equal 
participants in all aspects of Yale 
life-undergraduate and alumni-or 
are they? 


All the women I saw at theY ale 
Club one recent afternoon wore pants 
except me. All eight of them. Three 
were secretaries who rode the eleva-
tor with me to the seventh floor 
administrative offices where I want-
ed to inquire about filing a member-
ship application. I wasn't interested 
in joining-using the barbershop, 
banquet rooms, limousine service 
and valet. I simply wanted to snoop. 
A friend had just shot a scene from 
her underground film 
in the dining 
room where women are not allowed 
to eat dinner. I thought I'd check out 
the set. 


Miss G, in charge of membership, 
looked like all the other women in 
Yale offices, without whom the uni-
versity would collapse-fortyish, 
New England tailored, helpful, effi-
cient, and determined to guard the 
corridors of power. 


She gave me an application and 
the list of admissions committee 
members, two of whom must sign in 
order to be admitted. I glanced at 
their business addresses, in case I 
decided to contact someone-there 
was Madden. Plunket, Wetzel, and 
Scott, yes, that William J. Mad-
den, '62, and then James Preston, 
'67, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Mea-
gher and Flom, or was it Skadden, 
Madden, Slarps, Flott and-she 
whisked the paper away. Then she let 
me glimpse at the card with the fee 
scale, 10 per cent less for women, she 
explained, because "you can't use 
the fifth floor yet. The pool and 
S&llll;& baths, and steam room, you 
know, are off limits." She spoke rev-
erently, as if a bank vault were 
secreted there. "When will they be 
renovated to accomodate women?" I 
asked in my best trouble-maker tone. 
"Soon, I'm sure. Just wait." A pink 
blush peaked behind her rouge. I 
could see she was imagining naked 
men running around in towels. So 
was I. 


"I'm not a swimmer," I said, "but 
I would like to play squash." She 
smiled, delighted to tell me that 
since July, all the squash facilities 
were open to women-at $1.00 per 
fifteen minutes per court, with reser-
vations. Why did I feel so uncomfort-
able? Because of the double figure 
dues, paid "quarterly?" Because I 
needed an hour for a good work-out 
and would have to join Floro, Flun-
ket and Scoot before I could afford 
it? 


Miss G was being very friendly. 
No barriers. I was paranoid. I asked 
if I could look around, check out the 
facilities. She was horrified, her 
rouge spotting, "You can't just 
wander around on your own, that 
wouldn't do." The naked men on the 
fifth floor? Perhaps a nude swim-in 
was just the thing to liberate the 
place. 


She picked up the phone and made 
a few calls to find me a guide. Every-
one was "out to lunch." "Can't I just 
go up to the library and read? I've 
got some time to kill before ... " "No, 
I'm sorry, you might get stopped." 
Perhaps, like at the Pentagon, mem-
bers wore ID badges. 


I played my trump. " A friend of 
mine knows Mr. L, the manager, she 
made a film here. Can I see him?" 
(The movie was neo-Warhol, but he 
didn't have to know that.) "The 
manager?" Her face lit up. "Of 
course I'll call him." But he too was 
out to lunch. "Why don't you go 
down to the lobby to wait," she 
suggested. "We'll call you as soon as 
he's in." 


I waited nervously in the lobby-
plush and bustling like an ad 
agency-flipping through News-
week, Cue, Esquire, Vogue, studying 
the diagram of the Yale Bowl, my 
legs sticking to the Moroccan leather 
lounge chairs. I checked the display 
of club ties, the brochures on tours to 
Africa. 


Traffic around me was brisk-all 
shapes, sizes, and ages of conserv-
ative businessmen left the dining 
room, checked baggage and occa-
sionally squired a svelte woman. 
None of the women looked like alum-
nae. The atmosphere, including the 
Moroccan leather, exuded off-hand 
politeness, efficient snobbery and 
money. 


I investigated the ladies room. 
Marble sinks and elegantly stained 
wooden stall doors. 


I listened to the interactions, 
punctuated with words like market, 
benefits, sailboat. A silver-haired 
woman came in, pants and cape, ner-
vously peering. Immediately, a blue-
uniformed guard buttonholed her-
" Lady, what can I do for you?" 
"Over there, lady." She rang up 
someone at the hotel and sat oppo-
site me, her wan smile mirroring my 
own discomfort. 


An hour and a half passed. I re-
membered that I had bought a new 
paperback-Erica Jong-and pulled 
it out, hoping the dirty cover would 
get a rise out of someone. "The most 
uninhibited, delicious, erotic novel a 
woman ever wrote," John Updike 
blurbed on the cover. But I felt in-
creasingly anxious, untitillated, 
reading about a fantasy in an Italian 
train between a soldier and a widow. 
Most of the other loungees had Wall 
Street Journals. 


"Mr. L," someone said across the 
lobby, and I perked up. A man with 
polished loafers that curled up slight-
ly at the toes and with sleek grey 
hair that also curled up slightly, like 
Liberace's, slid over to the guard 
who had called him. He clutched a 
manila poster, announcing some 
football weekend gala. He and the 
guard argued where to hang it, by 
the front door, or by the dining hall. 
The doorman was obsequious, Mr. L 
this, Mr. L that. I wondered whether 
to announce myself. My friend said 
that he had been incredibly helpful 
on her film, even offering to take her 
to dinner when it was finished. But 
when she had called to say she had a 
friend in town, would he like to have 
a drink with us this week, he was 
busy with a hotel convention. Was 
he embarrassed that she had called 
his bluff? I decided to wait for Miss 
G to call me. 


Sure enough, a few minutes later, 
after Mr. L parted with the guard, 
she appeared, "Mr. L called from 
lunch to say he would be tied up in a 
conference all afternoon," she oozed, 
oh so polite. "He can't see you."
