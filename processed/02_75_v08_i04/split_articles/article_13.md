The NewJourruzl!February 14, 1975 
ed with Trigorin, so often I would cut 
back to Nina. I tried to get Trigorin to 
have more urgency on the camera. 
The play could have been his. But his 
characterization was bland, too 
mushy. He had done it before and 
never moved away from his earlier 
performance. 
NJ: How does one go about becom-
ing a director these days? 
Nikos: You train. You must go into 
a program in one of the few schools 
there are, unless you're an actor and 
switch later on. 
NJ: Howdidyou begin? 
Nikos: I went to school at Oberlin 
and then Yale. 
NJ: How do you go about directing 
a play? 
Nikos: First I read it, then I put it 
away for a while. I think about it, let 
it happen to me in my mind. Then I . 
form my ideas, backing them up with 
evidence, other things that are hap-
pening. 
NJ: Do you tell your actors how 
you want to do a play? 
Nikos: I just let them act. I don't 
say anything until they say some-
thing. It's much better to let the 
actors develop. You guide them, it's 
anthologizing, putting them into the 
right direction. 
NJ: Have you ever directed a disas-
ter? 
Nikos: I did a very bad version of 
"Lion in Winter." Wedidn'thititoff, 
it wasn't the right chemistry. I didn't 
have the right cast, and they didn't 
have the right director. What can you 
do? Afterit'sover,youjustsay, 
"back to the drawing board." 
NJ:Whatabouttheeconomicsof 
the theatre? Are the stories about the 
starving actors still true? 
Nikos: Yes. Starving actors are a 
fact of life because it's too easy to be-
come an actor, much too easy. If it 
were more difficult, there would be 
less of them, and if there were less of 
them, there would be less unem-
ployed. 
NJ: Alvin Epstein (director of 
many Yale Rep productions) was 
interviewed in the Yale Alumni 
Magazine a few years ago claiming 
there were too many amateurs in 
theatre. 
Nikos: He was right, there are too 
many, but who in hell is going to de-
cide who is an amateur? Still, you 
don't want a veterinarian to do heart 
surgery, do you? Then why do you 
allow untrained people to direct and 
act? I realize people believe it's in-
stinctual, butitisalsoascience. I 
trained for years, everyone should. 
There are a million amateurs who see 
themselves as professionals. 
NJ: Haveyoueverworkedin the 
commercial theatre? 
Nikos: Some of the things I have 
done have made money. What's the 
difference between the two? I don't 
think that everything done for art's 
sake is art, or that everything meant 
to be commercial is bad. Still, Amer-
ica is far behind where it should be. In 
Russia, the artists are paid as much 
as the Generals. Or so they tell me. 
I'm sorry we're not subsidized for 
theatre here. I envy people in Eng-
land and Canada. We don't have the 
money to do what we want. 
NJ: Whataboutresidentialcom-
panies? 
Nikos: I think the residential com-
panies are the salvation of the 
theatre. It's where people can do their 
best work. 
NJ: Have you seen any produc-
tions you have especially liked or dis-
liked in the past few years? 
Nikos: I really loved Oliver's 
"Uncle Vanya" in England last year. 
It was beautiful. It found what was 
contemporary in the material. And 
also Peter Brooke's "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," which was most 
inventive. The worst thing modem 
directors do is impose things on 
material when there's so much al-
ready there. To invent, before you 
take the time to discover, is danger-
ous. Youdon't mixupchemicalin-
gredients unless you first identify 
them and discover them. 
NJ: Is teaching important to you? 
Nikos: Obviously. It's more than 
half of my career, not in terms of time, 
but in terms of interest. At Williams-
town, we get in as many young people 
as possible at our school. They feed 
into our second company, and that 
feeds into our main one. 
NJ: Howmanyshowshaveyou 
done in your career? 
Nikos: I don'tkeep track, but more 
than a hundred. Now I try not to 
direct more than two or three plays a 
year, in order to continue to replenish 
my thoughts in between. 0
