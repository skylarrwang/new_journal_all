The Latest Final Policy 
by Carol Eliel and Mindy Beck 
Yale's policy towards freedom of 
expression has, it seems, come full 
circle. Or perhaps it never changed at 
all. Or perhaps-most importantly-
Yale has no coherent policy firmly 
and clearly stated. All of these points 
of view have been expressed in re· 
action to the recent release of the 
Report of the Committee on Freedom 
of Expression at Yale, known also as 
theW oodward Report. 

Over the past 12 years, President 
Brewster has often expressed the 
University's belief in "the encourage· 
ment of controversy, no matter how 
fundamental, and the protection of 
dissent, no matter how extreme." 
Furthermore, Brewster has also said 
that "willful disruption of the activ-
ity of the University cannot be toler· 
a ted. The right to recommend sus· 
pension or dismissal of anyone who 
disrupts the life of the University 
must be understood." 

Yetjustlastmonth the University 
saw fit to issue anew a statement of 
policy concerning freedom of ex pres· 
sion. On January 8, 1975 the admin-
istration distributed copies of the 
of Expression at Yale, the fmalstate-
ment of a 13-member committee 
chaired by Sterling Professor of 
History C. Vann Woodward. 

· In essence, this report reiterates 
the assumptions previopsly laid out 
by President Brewster. It states the 
"need for Yale to reaffirm a commit· 
ment to the principle of freedom of 
·expression and its superior impor· 
tance to other laudable principles and 
values, to the duty of all members of 
the University community to defend 
the right to speak and refrain from 
disruptive interference, and to the 
sanctions that should be imposed 
upon those who offend." The report 
suggests ten ways of achieving these 
ends, including an explicit statement 
of University policy, firm administra· 
tive action when freedom of ex pres· 
sion is denied anyone, and possible 
suspension or expulsion as punish· 
ment for disrupters. 

Why did Yale re-state policy when 
previous statements were clear? The 
answer lies in the administration's 
past reluctance to carry out its own 
policy. 

In 1963, the Political Union's 
executive board rescinded a speaking 
invitation to Governor George Wal-
lace of Alabama under what appears 
to have been heavy pressure from the 
Yale administration. In 1969, as mili-
tarism flared on campuses across the 
nation, students seized Wright Hall, 
and held University personnel cap· 
tive for several hours. Forty-seven 
students were suspended as a result, 
but were immediately reinstated, be-
cause "it was felt that the suspension 
was a sanction," according to Georges 
May, Dean ofY ale College at the 
time. Several times in the past ten 
years protestors have disrupted 
classes or film showings for a variety 
of reasons. The administration has 
never taken any serious or long-term 
disciplinary action. During April and 
May of 1970, at the time of the Black 
Panther murder trial in New Haven-
and the planned May Day demon· 
strations-freedom of expression was 
maintained at Yale in spite of high 
tension. But two years later, in April, 
1972, a hostile crowd shouting anti· 
war slogans and obscenities effective· 
ly prevented General William West· 
moreland, another P. U. speaker, from 
reaching the podium. No disciplinary 
action ensued. Shortly thereafter, 
Secretary of State William Rogers 
cancelled an appearance to receive a 
P. U. award, claiming "pressing 
engagements'' elsewhere. 

The Shockley affair last spring was 
thus only the last in along line of 
events at Yale bringing to the fore-
front the University's policy-or lack 
thereof-on freedom of expression. 

As unclear as it had been in the past, 
administration PQlicy was even 
vaguer in the spring of 1974. Shock· 
ley himself called the episode "the 
administratively worst-handled dis-
ruption I've experienced." The appar-
entlack of standard procedures led 
Brewster to establish a committee 
• 'to examine the condition of free 
. expression, peaceful dissent, mutual 
r:_;spectand tolerance at Yale, (and) to 
draft recommendations for any 
measures it may deem necessary for 
the maintenance of those principles." 

Early this year the committee pub· 
lished its final statement. 

Included in the booklet with the 
committee's report is a statement by 
· the one dissenting member of the 
committee, Kenneth J. Barnes, a 
graduate student in both law and 
economics. "Specific limitations of 
tolerance are justifiable," Barnes 
• writes, "if they further the pursuit of 
• truth." In addition, he claims that the 
powerful have more influence in con-
trolling the "free marketplace of 
• ideas" than minority groups do, and 
thus "can.dominate the market and 
drive out weaker, albeit 'true' ideas." 
Free expression in the short run does 
not always outweigh potential long-
run costs, Barnes says, thereby dis· 
agreeing with the majority's view, 
"that the results of free expression 
are to the general benefit in the long 
run, however unpleasant they may 
appear at the time." 

Reacti<_>n to the rep<?rt has been 
_._,.. · mixed. President Brewster issued 
only a short statement in response to 
theW oodward Report. He praised 
·"the Committee's insistent desire to 
st~1_1gtheJ?. the protection of freedom 
of expression at Yale," although he 
disagreed. with the recommendation 
that University offieials should 
a ttempt to dissuade a group from 
issuing a particular invitation. Brew· 
ster also suggested that "suspension 
for not less than a year ... be auto-
matic" for those found to have dis-
rupted a University event. 

Stanley Flink, Yale's Director of 
Public Information, stressed that the 
Woodward Committee's report was 
only a recommendation, and not yet 
University policy. The Yale Corpor· 
ation, which ultimately is the body to 
set policy, began consideration of the 
matter on February 8, and may not 
make any decisions until the next 
Corporation meeting. Flink did say, 
however, that a clear policy on free· 
dom of expression at Yale will be laid 
down within the next few months, 
adding that "the maximum freedom 
of expression is still th~ principle and 
always has been." He called the 
present time an "interim moment," a 
point at which the University has no 
official policy. As far as press cover· 
age of campus events is concerned, he 
said that for the present "there is no 
policy but common sense." He would 
not comment further on the report 
and added that President Brewster's 
statement was also final. 

Professor C. V ann Woodward, 
chairman of the committee which 
authored the report, was "very satis-
fied with (it)," and added, " ) very 
much appreciated (Brewster's) sup-
port, especially the last line of his 
letter," which emphasized that dis· 
ruption of a University event is not 
tolerable. W ood.ward feels that the 
Corporation may alter or add to the 
report before establishing it as Uni· 
versity policy, but claimed that in 
any form such a policy would affect 
campus activities. "I believe," he 
said, "that it will encourage a new 
spirit about the principle of free 
speech." In general he found support 
of free speech • 'pretty widespread in 
the University," calling the opinion 
promulgated by the dissenting state· 
mentone of a "non-representative 
minority." He continued, "I find it 
ironic that this opposition to free 
speech is largely radical and this 
movement which started out in 
Berkeley in 1964 as the Free Speech 
Movement has turned out in its latter 
days to be against free speech." 

Thomas Spahn, former Executive 
Director of Lux et Veritas, one of the 
campus groups which considered in-
viting Shockley last year, com-
mented, "I always assumed that the 
University believed in the freedom of 
speech ... The committee just re-stated 
the obvious." lr. 3hort, he was "very, 
very plea:::ed" wich the committee's 
statement. Spahn was disappointed 
with the U Diversity's vague policy on 
television coverage of Yale events, 
but added that the committee no 
doubt had been unable to study such 
problems due to lack of time. He did 
not feel that the report would affect 
Lux et Veritas, a conservative group 
engendered by the radical activities 
on May Day 1970. "We wanted to 
bring in a variety of viewpoints to 
campus that aren't normally heard, 
and we'll keep on doing that," said 
Spahn. (In January, Lu.xet Veritas 
published.a detailed history on free 
speech at Yale during the sixties and 
seventies, and included its own 
views). Greg Hyatt, the current Exec-
utive Director of Lux et V eritas, also 
feels that "it was a pretty good re-
port ... It comes down hard for free 
speech and against disruption, which 

is the proper attitude as far as I'm 
concerned." Hyatt said that he didn't 
like the dissenting report, but added 
that he felt the majority report looked 
even better in light of it. 

Eugene Meyer, the President of the 
Young Americans for Freedom at 
Yale, the group that finally sponsored 
the Shockley debate, feels similarly 
about the committee's report. "Basi-
cally I was pretty pleased with it," he 
said. It seemed to stress the need for 
freedom of speech or some kind of 
freedom of expression." He did not 
think that the report would alter 
significantly theY .A.F. 's invitation 
policy. Meyer stated that he personal-
ly felt that before inviting a speaker 
theY .A.F. should consider whether 
or not the meeting would be valuable 
to the participants, not whether or 
not it would be disrupted. Nor was he 
altogether confident of the report's 
future success as University policy. 
"I don't think, given Yale's record on 
freedom of speech, that feeling secure 
would be terribly rational," he said. 
But I feel that the chances by and 
large are a lot better than they would 
have been without that report ... It 
remains to be seen what will happen." 

But there are others who disagree 
with the report's findings, and who 
claim that their opinion is being ig-
nored. Elwyn Lee, former Chairman 
of the Black Law Students Union, 
insisted "Ken Barnes is absolutely 
right when he says that very little 
attention is being paid to his dis-
sent ... It's ironic." Lee was originally 
upset over the composition of the 
committee, because he felt it was 
designed to vindicate an as yet un-
announced, presumed consensus 
about free speech, "a mythical con-
sensus which wasn't defined." Lee 
believes that any University official, 
in accord with his right to free speech, 
should be allowed to speak out on the 
propriety of an invitation to anyone 
to appear at Yale; he believes that the 
report heads in the right direction on 
this matter although "the committee 
members don't go as far as (Lee) 
would like." 

Lee's biggest criticism of the 
Woodward Report involves the sec-
tion entitled' 'Of Ways and Means." 
He claimed that the report allows for 
peaceful registration of opposition 
but nothing more. Thus, Lee said, the 
fact that •• (the committee members) 
don't want anybody hurt" is placed 
above their belief in freedom of ex-
pression. In addition, he said that the 
report focuses too heavily on the dis-
ruption of speeches and ignores other 
violations of the freedom of expres-
sion. Lee criticized Brewster's desire 
for standard punishment of disrup-
ters, claiming that hidden that desire 
was a feeling that the President "does 
not trust the faculty," ... and that he 
was disappointed by what the exec-
utive committee did to those students 
brought before it after the Shockley 
affair. Lee feels that Brewster's lack 
of trust contradicts the "supposed 
consensus on free speech'' that some 
claim exists. In general, Lee com-
plained that the committee did not do 
much thinking, because "they knew 
what they were going to say in ad-
vance." 

Michael Darnell, present Chairman 
criticized theW oodward Report as 
being simplistic. "To call for an ab-
solute rule on this campus is to ignore 
restraints on freedom of expression in 
the greater society," he said, citing 
such examples as the practical joker 
who yells "fire" in a crowded theatre 
or the old man who displays himself 
to young girls on the street. Accord-
ing to Darnell, "The Woodward Com-
mittee Report would throw dis-
cretion, reason, morality, and many 
of the other values we ... cherish off the 
campus or subordinate them ... to an 
'absolutism' that denies man's ability 
to solve problems." He focused on the 
Shockley affair, decrying the use of 
the "absolutism" which he thinks the 
Woodward Report advocates as a 
''free ticket to those racists who 
abound (at Yale) to inflict irreparable 
harm upon minorities under the guise 
of scholarship.'' Darnell argued that 
"'absolutism' does not justify the 
relegating of morality to third class 
status among values." In addition, he 
faulted the report on the grounds that 
the committee was predominantly 
white, and that the final statement 
was written largely by four of the 
thirteen committee members and 
based on preconceived notions. 

Three letterw signed by a total of 
4 7 members of theY ale faculty also 
registered disapproval of theW ood-
ward Report and of President Brew-
ster's recommendations. The short-
est letter, from three faculty mem-
bers, said, ''There are circumstances 
and situations in which 'free expres-
sion' can inflict a violence which, 
though less obvious than physical 
force, is perhaps no less severe ... We ... 
urge the Corporation to take account 
of the' non-physical forms which 
violence can assume, and to refrain 
from taking too facile a stand on the 
questions of disruptions." The eleven 
signers of a second letter wrote, 
" ... We understand that individuals 
may at times feel bound in conscience 
to oppose (a) speech.'' They added, 
"We do not believe that it is possible 
to assign primary importance to one 
value unconditionally, be it freedom 
of expression or any other value,'' 
thus attacking the basic premise of 
theW oodward Report. The third let-
ter, signed by 44 professors, urged 
that "on both moral and pragmatic 
grounds ... the University ... retain the 
possibility of a mild or suspended 
sentence in a case of interference with 
free speech.'' They claimed that 
denial of discretion in sentencing was 
an abdication of "the moral responsi-
bility of judgment." They said also 
that the ability of severe sanctions to 
deter further disruptions was at best 
doubtful. The 44 professors claimed 
that mild rather than severe sanc-
tions would often be appropriate "in 
light of adequate mitigating circum-
stances." 

Does Yale have a coherent policy 
on the freedom of expression? T«h-
nically speaking, not yet. Yet almost 
everyone is treating the Woodward 
Report as if-with minor additions or 
alterations-it were already policy. 
And reaction to the report is spread-
ing outside of theY ale community. 
InarecentarticleintheNew York 
Times, Anthony Lewis wrote, "Other 
Universities will look to the Wood-
ward Report for a philosophical ex-
position of the classical argument for 
freedom.'' The report is making far-
reaching ripples in the academic 
pond.O
