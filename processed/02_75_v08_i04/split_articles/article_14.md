"How about tomorrow morning?" I 
asked. "Some other time, I'm a-
fraid." 
Clutching Erica Jong, I took the 
next elevator up to the library. It re-
minded me of L & B, deep shiny 
worn-leather chairs, arched windows, 
the ease and stuffiness of an English-
man's study. Several retired types 
slept in assorted positions in arm-
chairs. I remembered that L & B 
used to be closed to women, and got 
bolder. 
I tried to figure out the classifica-
tion system. One section for bio-
graphy, another for history, I wan-
dered from shelf to shelf. My eye fell 
on the row labeled "Women." The 
first book was The Dangerous Sex, 
by H. R. Hays. Then there was Life 
with Women and How to Survive it, 
A Guide, with such helpful hints as 
how to explain a football game to 
your wife. 
Perhaps Helen Gurlie Brown's Sex 
and the Single Girl was more my 
line. Then there was Esquire's All 
About Women. Women Today, now 
that might prove useful, "A Source-
book." It was published, alas, in 
1938. 
I had expected these titles, rem-
nants of the old blue, no-pants days. 
But the tokens of the times surprised 
me. Here was The Second Sex, The 
Feminine Mystique, The Female 
Eunuch, even Sexual Politics, all in 
hefty hardback. I was feeling the old 
schizophrenia. A quick check showed 
The Feminine Mystique had been 
borrowed exactly three times since 
1966. Still, a beginning. For histori-
cal perspective, there was Everyone 
was Brave, about the suffrage move-
ment, no complaints there, and even, 
wonder of wonders, that radical 
socialist feminist Charlotte Perkins 
Gilman's Woman and Labor, posi- . 
tively communistic. The book selec-
tion committee must have thought it 
was about pregnancy. 
There were a few other titles I 
didn't recognize, though The Bold 
Women sounded promising. About 
hookers? And then my favorite, John 
Stuart Mill's classic On the Subjec-
tion of Women. I knew it well. An 
eminent professor had once told me 
that you had to watch out for his 
conclusions because he had been liv-
ing in sin with that woman Harriet. 
What two books were the most 
dog-eared, tattered and stained with 
the largest number of purple date 
stamps? You guessed it-Andrew 
Sinclair's The Better Half, and Ash-
ley Montague's The Natural Superi-
ority of Women. 
Before I discovered any other Yale 
Club secrets, or got thrown out, I 
hoisted my totebag, a few sheets of 
engraved notepaper, and a copy of 
Penthouse Magazine left open on the 
ta!>le. I stole it as a political act, re-
membering the pants dropped in the 
elevator. O

**Thoughts on a National Police Academy**
**Author: Edward F. Droge, Jr.**

Thoughts on a National Police 
Academy 
Two and one half years ago the 
Knapp Commission asserted, in no 
uncertain terms, that corruption was 
widespread in the New York City 
Police Department. Since then, other 
major cities have taken to task the 
investigation of their own police de-
partments. The results of those in-
vestigations have flowed in a steady 
stream before the public in the form 
of sordid front-page stories. One city 
recently in the news was Phila-
delphia. Corruption in its police 
department, said the Pennsylvania 
Crime Commission, was "ongoing, 
widespread, systematic and occur-
ring at all levels." Moreover, the 
commission accused the mayor of 
attempting to block the investiga-
tion. In the interim between the 
Knapp Commission Report and the 
Pennsylvania Crime Commission 
Report, a spate of police depart-
. ments bit the bullet while bearing up 
to degrading allegations concerning 
the ethical performance of their men: 
Detroit, Baltimore, Newark, Cleve-
land, Chicago, Albany, Minneapolis, 
Atlantic City, Paterson, Indiana-
polis-the list grows longer every 
month. 
Shocking? Apparently not. It 
seems that ugly revelations of this 
nature about the police of numerous 
cities are not enough to spur the 
country into taking measures to 
treat the problem effectively. Per-
haps it is because the people already 
know that their high school educated 
policemen are not really the "finest." 
Perhaps the media headlines are old 
news to most people who know from 
their own experience the extent to 
which the corruption exists. Perhaps 
the public expects no more from its 
police. Perhaps every major city in 
the country will have to rumble with 
police department scandals before 
there is an impetus for action. But 
one thing is certain: everyone, in-
cluding the majority of this coun-
try's policemen, would rather have 
corruption-free departments, yet 
little is being done to achieve that 
end. True, there are many energetic 
individuals and organizations, such 
as the Police Foundation and the 
staff working under the Law En-
forcement Assistance Act, striving 
to better our police. But when viewed 
with a national perspective, the 
effort is relatively minimal, par-
ticularly when it is becoming in-
creasingly clear that most-if not 
all-major cities suffer corruption to 
some degree. 
The problem is not so easily 
solved. It is not as simple as a few 
rotten applies in the barrel. An entire 
system-a tradition-must be 
broken. 
The time has come for a National 
Police Academy, or at least a study 
of the National Police Academy con-
cept. The idea is not that complex. 
A national institution with a curri-
culum aimed at producing profes-
sional police officers could be set up 
similar to the military academies. 
Earnest, career-minded individuals 
would be recruited and awarded not 
only a college-level degree, but also 
officer rank, in return for an obliga-
tion to serve in a specified police de-
partment for a certain number of 
years following graduation. While it 
may be a good idea to provide the 
stipulation that a graduate be per-
mitted to serve in various cities 
during his career, by no means would 
this institution be an invitation to 
nationalize our police force. High 
standards would be set for the 
Academy a.nd maintained at a level 
commensurate with the desired re-
sult-a truly professional graduate 
who can not only cope face-to-face 
with corruption, but who can also 
help in overcoming the system that 
actively plagues our police depart-
ments. 
In the police departments of most 
major cities today a candidate needs 
only a high school diploma or its 
equivalent to satisfy the educational 
prerequisites for the job. When an in-
dividual is accepted he is given four 
to six months training, which is 
intended to cover the entire spec-
trum of police duties and assign-
ments. This includes little or no 
corruption training. Four to six 
months of training and that's it-
instant police officer. It cannot be 
too surprising, therefore, that the 
people living in corruption-ridden 
cities expect no more from their 
police, considering the educational 
standards and extent of training. 
The all-important role a police officer 
plays in our society demands a better 
educated, better trained individual 
for the position. 
In a National Police Academy, a 
single course on corruption might 
last four to six months. The graduate 
would be college educated. He would 
be looked upon as nothing less than a 
true professional and his peers would 
expect nothing less than professional 
performance at all times. The pres-
sure would be on those officers who 
chose not to conform to the image. 
The creation of a National Police 
academy-for the purpose of com-
batting police corruption-is becom-
ing more and more necessary and 
compelling with each passing day, 
with each passing newspaper splash, 
with each passing city losing con-
fidence in its men in blue. 0

**Depression Chic**
**Author: Jon Etra**

Depression chic 
My bank collapsed. The fastest loan 
in town. One point eight billion dol-
lars. Ninety branches throughout the 
New York metropolitan area. When 
the need is financial-Security Na-
tional-KABOOM-the reaction is 
Chemical-SHAZAAM! 
(My bank had collapsed.) 
Fiduciary waters run deep. These 
were the people who gave me a ticket 
to the World's Fair in '64 when I 
opened my first account and added 
page 15 
an avocado enamel percolator in '73 
when I joined Christmas Club. I 
b..9ught stamps in their postage 
machine, made copies on their xerox, 
watched their philodendrons grow 
from sturdy sprouts to spindly 
fronds. This was no idle mercenary 
cartel. This was my bank. My bank. 
Initially I belonged to the Royal 
National of New York and some 
years back, it was absorbed by 
Security. Now, Security struck me at 
the time as lacking something of the 
imperial fillip of the Royal National. 
Security was, as we know, a Long 
Island bank, which is to say not real-
ly a bank at all but more likely a sort 
of grange (or combine) or modified 
alfalfa fund which one would never 
think of as actually dealing in real, 
live, legitimate, tinkling money (one 
could see the bushels of apples and 
corn strewn hither thither about the 
rude wood-beamed arches of its 
vaults). And yet an admirable brava-
do lingered around this metropolitan 
interloper which in the end caught 
my economic whimsy. Here was the 
proverbial David facing off the 
megalosaurian Philistines. I was 
stirred. 
Now all is gone, eviscerated, ex-
punged. What have you done to my 
bank, William Simon? Two billion 
dollars of the little guy's best blood 
sold down the river for forty million 
pieces of corporate silver-it gives 
one a lasting financial frisson even to 
consider such an unconscionable fire 
sale. What delight is my share of the 
nation's seventh largest bank com-
pared to that erstwhile acre in the 
bedrock of America's sterling 
seventy-ninth? I am now party to 
those des testable stiffs who fought 
slammin' Saul Steinberg and the 
Leasco Data boys. I am now all 
that's tedious in American sound in-
vestment, all that's boring in our 
dependable national institutions. I 
will never get a percolator again. 
There is however some compen-
sation. Economic ruin has brought 
me a rare gift: the chance to step into 
the past. For me at least those won-
derful bread line days are back. 
Think of it, shadows of 1930, my 
bank has collapsed. I am a child 
again, a disreputable scion of no less 
than Herbert Hoover: Archie Bun-
ker's dream, selling apples on the 
street, tooling off to California, soup 
kitchens and mercy missions-the 
unutterable charm of the crash. 
Admittedly I am not the first of 
this nostalgic new wave. Those won-
derful people who brought you 
Franklin National, uh, European-
American won the lead. But I am 
still of the privileged few. True, 
FDIC has protected the cash, but in 
spirit I am still beset. My clothes 
have grown shabby. I walk with a 
slouch, ration stamps in pocket, 
WP A card at hand. I am an honored 
ghost, the envy of disaffected multi-
tudes, comrade of the eternal supine. 
And what of the rest of you, will 
you be denied this heady pas de deux 
with debacle, this epopee of economic 
demise? Take heart. Have faith. 0
