The Experience of Directing 
byJemWiner 
Nikos Constantin A thansios Psach-
aropoulos VII has taught acting and 
directing at Yale for almost twenty 
years. For eighteen of those years he 
has.also beenExecutiveDirectorof 
the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 
Massachusetts, considered by many 
critics to be the finest summer theatre 
in the country. 

· Emmy winner Dick Cavett and 
Obie winners Sam Waterston and 
Stacy Keach began their careers 
under Nikos at Yale. So did actor/ 
director Austin Pendleton (who won 
an Qbie for "The Last Sweet Days of 
Isaac" and appeared in "Catch 22," 
and "What's Up, Doc?") and Long 
Wharf Director Arvin Brown. Geral-
dine Fitzgerald, Lee Grant, E. G. 
Marshall, Mildred Dunnock, Thorn-
ton Wilder and dozens of others have 
acted in his productions at Williams-
town. 

Last summer, Nikos directed his 
61 st production at Williamstown, 
Chekov 's 'The Seagull. " The cast 
included Lee Grant, Blythe Danner, 
Kevin McCarthy, andFrankLan-
gella. The National Educational Tele-
vision Network asked him to film the 
production for their Theatre in Amer-
ica series. Nikos accepted, and re-
solved to do all editing himself. Five 
and a half days of shooting, three 
hundred thousand dollars, three 
months of editing, and many Nikos 
man-hours later, "The Seagull" 
appeared on national television to 
considerable acclaim. Reviewers 
called it "a natural, energetic Chek-
ov, "and "the most complete Chekov 
imaginable. "The only sour notes 
came from aN. Y. Times reviewer, 
who didn't like the background 
music, composed by Arthur Ruben-
stein ("not the famous one, " says 
Nikos). 

We talked to Nikos about the ex-
perience of filming the work. We 
caught him on the run, between class, 
and a screening of "The Seagull" for 
his Yale students at the Art and 
Architecture Building. He talked 
about the problems of directing 
Chekov, teaching, working with 
actors, and making theatre into tele-
vision. 

NJ: How did your first t .v. produc-
tion come about? 
Nikos: "The Seagull" is not my 
first televised play, it's just the first 
in which I supervised the photo-
graphy and also the editing. First, 
N .E. T . asked me to do it, I asked the 
cast, and finally we did it. It was a 
good choice for me, because Chekov 
adapts himself to the t.v. screen well; 
he never writes about something or 
_someone you can't see. You just need 
an exterior and an interior set. Can 
you imagine " Our Town" on t .v.? It 
wouldn't work. With "The Seagull" I 
didn't have to keep it a play or make it 
a movie but could just make it be 
Chekovon t.v. 

NJ: Have you been happy with the 
result? How have your reviews been? 
Nikos: The East coast reviewers 
liked it, but the three Los Angeles 
papers flipped over it. They say that 
Chekov is all of a sudden a household 
word. That's great. 

NJ: Howdidyougoaboutcasting 
it? 
Nikos: I cast the people I like, and 
I cast them for the Williamstown 
stage, not for t.v. Emotional range is 
primary, since they're all profession-
als, you assume the vocal and physi-
cal range. 

NJ: How was the actual stage per-
formance? 
Nikos: There were some problems. 
We only rehearsed about two weeks 
and four days. It's never enough 
though people exaggerate how much 
time you need. Lee Grant had diffi-
culties getting an idea of her aura, the 
characterization of Arkadina in Mos-
cow. There were also a lot of battles. 
Lee had thought she was going to 
relax, enjoy a vacation and her art, 
and then 37 reviewers came up and 
criticized her performance. There-
views were mostly bad and that put 
pressure on. She was frightened by all 
of the publicity. 

NJ: Did the film version change. 
any of the performances? 
Nikos: Lee was better on t .v. than 
she was on stage where she was too 
undisciplined. All the others were 
more or less the same. 

NJ: Were there any difficulties in 
the actual filming? 
Nikos: We only had five and a half 
days. Trying to coordinate color when 
you're shooting day and night is al-
most impossible. I also knew I had to 
shrink the performance for t.v. True 
adaptation to the medium changes 
what you're doing, although I didn't 
re-direct any of the scenes. We filmed 
it on location at Williamstown, bor-
rowing a Williams College professor's 
house. All we had to do to it was 
change the shutters. We brought up 
the furniture we needed from New 
York. 

NJ: Five and a half days sounds 
like a very short time. 
Nikos: The last day we worked 
twenty-five hours straight. At least 
the last three hours were pure hell. 
Cameras take four hours to set up 
sometimes, then the actors get up and 
act for maybe five or ten minutes. 
Then they have to move the cameras 
again. But the crew was excellent. 
The man who did the audio has won 
four academy awards. Most of our 
lighting problems were taken care of 
later, in the studio. We ended up re-
lighting the entire play and added 
special effects. For example, when I 
had a close-up of Blythe (Danner, who 
played Nina, a young country girl 
aspiring to be an actress), we colored 
the film just a shade pink. 

NJ: Did you re-shoot many scenes? 
Nikos: WeshotonelineofBlythe's 
fourteen times to get the right effect. 
But Act IV was done in one take. We 
used three cameras most of the time. 
. Usually, whenyou'reselectingshots 
from the truck, a red light goes on in 
the camera that is filming. So the 
actor ends up knowing which of the 
three cameras is taking his picture. I 
asked the camera men, "Is there any 
way that they won't know?" They · 
said, • 'Yes, if you put the cameras in 
isolation." Which we did, leaving me 
to work on it later, taking the time in 
the editing room. It's not the best 
way. 

NJ:Why? 
Nikos: It drives you bananas. 
Especially with tape. I dicllearn a lot 
about the medium, when to use close-
~ps. I also got involved with the 
rhythm of editing: is this a group 
shot, or a person, or whatever. I en-
joyed cutting back and forth. But the 
real work was done with the actors. 
The t.v. work was mostly technical. 

NJ: Were you unhappy with any of 
the performances? 
Nikos: I could not do what I want-
