**Liz Holtzman and the Impeachment Hearings**
**Author: Chris Whipple**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

Those who are accustomed to her 
Washington behavior fmd that diffi-
cult to imagine. In Washington, 
Holtzman seldom has the time or in-
clination to talk to her own staff, and 
when she does she looks so nervous 
that she makes even her shyest in-
terns feel at ease. She is constantly 
intense, impatient with intruders, 
uncomfortable with any kind of 
small talk that might keep her from 
her work. 
But when Liz Holtzman is out 
campaigning in the streets of Flat-
bush, in her Brooklyn district, she 
undergoes what seems to be a total 
transformation. "You ought to see 
her with her constituents," remarks 
one of her Washington staff in dis-
belief, "she is warm, compassionate, 
understanding .. .it's because they 
aren't really people; they're constit-
uents." Whatever they are, Holtz-
man treats them more like people 
than Celler ever did, who never 
bothered to maintain an office in his 
district and seldom ventured out of 
Washington to keep in touch. Holtz-
man regularly turns down speaking 
invitations to spend one day a week 
with her constituents. And they re-
spond in kind. Last month Holtzman 
took the oath of office for a second 
term after capturing 78.6 per cent of 
the vote. 

Holtzman's Washington staff 
must set some sort of record for 
being underpaid and overworked. 
Marilyn, who has been with her since 
they both worked for Lindsay, is the 
first to admit that Holtzman is not 
an easy-going type. This results in 
a fairly rapid tum-over on her staff; 
they seem to come and go nearly as 
fast as they are hired. During the Im-
peachment hearings Holtzman 
worked in nearly total isolation from 
her staff. On our arrival we were told 
by Marilyn that whenever Liz was on 
her way to the office we were to make 
ourselves as scarce as possible. So 
when Liz was on her way from the 
committee we would retreat down 
the hall to the annex. Like Wood-
ward.and Bernstein, Holtzman goes 
her own way without a family to tie 
her down. But unlike either Wood-
ward or Bernstein, she has no appar-
ent social life to distract her from her 
work. 

She has never been a favorite of 
the committee, but Liz Holtzman is 
respected for her obvious legal 
talent. Larry Hogan, the Republican 
from Maryland, spoke of her ten-
dency "to face the world with a chip 
on her shoulder," but added that she 
"is very bright, brilliant, hard work-
ing, dedicated." No one argues with 
that estimation. It was Holtzman's 
lawsuit, for example, that very near-
ly ended the bombing of Cambodia 
not too long ago (Justice Douglas 
sustained her suit that the bombing 
was unconstitutional but the full 
court was hastily convened to over-
rule him). And it was Holtzman's 
questioning that caught Gerald Ford 
contradicting himself in his Vice-
Presidential confirmation hearings. 

So as the televised hearings began 
and Holtzman waited for her turn to 
speak, there was no question that 
she knew the evidence cold. What 
she would do with it in front of all the 
lights and cameras was another 
matter. Holtzman seemed oddly out 
The New Journal/February 14, 1975 
of place-uncomfortable with the 
hearings despite her obvious prepa-
ration for them. I recall one day 
when she was charging around the 
office, waving a copy of the New 
York Times above her head. Her pic-
ture was spread across the first page. 
She was overwhelmed by it-de-
lighted, but maybe just a little 
scared as well. 

It was, after all, a proceeding of 
high theater as well as history, no 
ordinary meeting of the House Judi-
ciary Committee. Three days before, 
the day the televised hearings began, 
Holtzman had to wait her turn while 
the senior members delivered their 
opening fifteen-minute monologues. 
The scene outside room 2141 of the 
Rayburn Building resembled the 
stage of a musical comedy before the 
curtain has gone up. Police were 
swarming in the corridors, reporters 
were badgering each other, ex-
changing notes, waiting for the solo-
ists to appear. Some demonstra-
tors-mostly middle-aged and 
matronly-were holding a "Fast for 
Nixon" outside. Curiously, impeach-
ment seemed to arouse only fanatics. 
Roger Mudd was questioning Rodino 
around the comer from the commit-
tee room when someone yelled, "Ask 
Rodino why his Jewish Mafia friends 
are fucking the impeachment!" An 
armed escort showed him to the 
door. 

Inside room 2141 no one was un-
moved by the occasion. Liz Holtz-
man's mother was sitting in the staff 
seat provided to each committee 
member. On previous occasions, 
when I had occupied it myself, I 
imagined that I saw Liz Holtzman 
wondering who the hell I was. Now 
she was probably wondering what to 
say in her first speech the following 
day. 

At 7:45 in the evening, Chairman 
Rodino called the meeting to order. 
It was Rodino who had charted the 
impeachment process through uncer-
tain territory and under bitter oppo-
sition from all sides. He had set the 
tone for the proceedings in his open-
ing remarks: "The committee must 
now decide a question of the highest 
Constitutional importance," he said, 
and then quoting Edmund Burke, "it 
is by this tribunal that statesmen 
who abuse their power are accused 
by statesmen and tried by states-
men, not upon the niceties of narrow 
jurisprudence, but upon the enlarged 
and solid principles of state mor-
ality ... Let us go forward ... Whatever 
we now decide we must have the 
integrity and the decency, the will 
and the courage, to decide right ... " 

Since that first day, Holtzman had 
been re-drafting her own statement 
while the other members followed 
Rodino's lead. They avoided "narrow 
jurisprudence" and spoke eloquently 
about the larger picture. It was an 
impressive collection of speeches-
a virtuoso performance for members 
of the House of Representatives, who 
were better known as party hacks 
and undistinguished politicians. 

"Here the issue is the Constitution," 
said Hamilton Fish, "and in asses-
sing the fitness of the President for 
remaining in office the Congress be-
comes the conscience and protector 
of the State." Walter Flowers, the 
conservative white Southerner,

seemed to have been struggling with 
his conscience. His speech may have 
been the most eloquent of all: 
Our problem is not now to find 
better values, but I say our prob-
lem is to be faithful to those we 
profess and make them live in 
modem times ... 'We the people of 
the United States,' and surely 
there is no more inspiring phrase 
than this- 'We, the people of the 
United States,' not we the public 
officials of the United States, not 
we the certified experts, or we the 
educated, or we the grown-ups 
over twenty-one or twenty-five, 
not we the privileged classes, or 
whatever, butjustsimply 'We, the 
people ... We, acting in our com-
munities across the nation, can 
pull our fragmented nation to-
gether ... 

So on the second day, when Liz 
Holtzman gave her fifteen-minute 
statement, she had reason to be ner-
vous. She was not about to steal the 
show. Holtzman, 36th in seniority 
out of 38 members, had heard other 
members make many of her points 
already; and Barbara Jordan, the 
massive black congresswoman from 
Texas,hadjustknockedthewind 
out of the galleries with her remarks. 
Jordan had become one of the favor-
ites on the committee, respected for 
her eloquence and for her thundering 
delivery. In contrast, Holtzman, 
looking pale and slight behind her 
hornrimmed glasses, spoke in a fal-
tering voice. While most of the other 
members were staring blankly into 
space or jotting notes, she began, 
"Mr. Chairman, as we sit here to 
measure President Nixon's conduct 
against the standard set in the Con-
stitution of the United States each 
one of us has questioned what the 
Constitution means ... and each mem-
ber on the committee is publicly 
groping for the right thing to do ... " 
in fact, as everyone on the committee 
knew, Liz Holtzman had never exact-
ly "groped" for the right thing to do. 
She had been a sure vote for im-
peachment all along. Now she was 
groping for the right words to intro-
duce the list of evidence she had pre-
pared. She continued, "it is prin-
cipally out of the President's own 
mouth and through his own words 
that we find the strongest evidence 
of the high crimes and misdemeanors 
he has committed ... " Now she 
seemed to be recovering her poise 
and spoke defiantly- if just a little 
nervously-quoting Nixon on the 
subject of the FBI, the CIA, the pay-
ment of hush money to defendants, 
offers of executive clemency and so 
on. She lacked the eloquence of J or-
dan, but by the end of her speech, as 
she recommended that the commit-
tee vote to impeach the President, 
Holtzman was looking more relaxed. 

Across the street in Holtzman's 
office, Marilyn, who had been watch-
ing nervously, looked visibly re-
lieved. There was nothing remark-
able about her opening speech, 
except perhaps the fact that Liz 
Holtzman, the shy congresswoman 
from New York, had begun to warm 
to the occasion. 

If she seemed a little nervous on 
her opening night, that was hardly 
unexpected. But what Holtzman 
lacked in poise that night she made 
up for in her first real test the follow-
ing day. The opening fifteen-minute 
statements were only the ground-
work for the actual debate. On the 
substance of the articles of impeach-
ment Holtzman came as well pre-
pared as any of her senior colleagues. 
On the first day of the debate on 
Article I, Holtzman came to the 
assistance of the senior Democrats 
on a point of obscure law. Paul Sar-
banesÂ·had been assigned to introduce 
the first article of impeachment, and 
he had run into some unexpected 
trouble. Charles Wiggins, Nixon's 
most articulate defender, asked when 
the "policy" to obstruct justice had 
literally begun. Charles Sandman, 
another Nixon supporter, closed in. 
"Is it your understanding of the 
law," he asked, "that the articles of 
impeachment must be specific ... ?" 
"Wouldn't it be a damning indict-
ment," Wiggins added, "if this com-
mittee, if after all this time and 
money we were unable to state with 
specificity what this case is all 
about?" Sarbanes looked confused. 
Hardly anyone, it seemed, had been 
prepared to deal with "specificity." 
Except for Liz Holtzinan. "It's 
true," she countered, "that earlier 
impeachment hearings pleaded very 
specific language. It's also true at 
that tim~ that they were based on 
general civic practice which required 
factual pleading. We abandoned that 
system in 1938: .. and have been oper-
ating on a notice pleading system 
which has been held innumerable 
times to supply the defendants due 
process of law." I doubt that her con-
stituents understood it, but Holtz-
man was beginning to make her 
points to the Committee in her inimi-
table way. Although uncomfortable 
with her opening speech, Holtzman 
delivered lectures to her colleagues 
when debating minute points of 
evidence or law. 

By the time of the debate on the 
secret bombing of Cambodia and 
Nixon's tax evasion (the articles that 
did not pass), Holtzman was leading 
the debate in what was unfortunate-
ly a losing cause. Most of the mem-
bers agreed that the bombing of 
Cambodia was an impeachable 
offense; they disagreed on whether 
Congress had approved the Pres-
ident's action. "I am not saying," 
snapped Holtzman, "that if the 
secret bombing were made public 
that the Congress would not have 
approved it. Congress may very well 
have approved it. But it was the 
right of Congress to have approved it 
and it was the right of Congress to 
have known and it was the right of 
the people to have approved it. That 
is the point that is made here and 
that is the reason for the seriousness 
of the President's actions." So effec-
tive was Liz Holtzman in the debate 
on Nixon's taxes that Sandman, who 
apparently could think of nothing 
else, accused her of libeling the Pres-
ident. Toward the end, when Cald-
well Butler need a "chief resource 
person" on the subject of Cambodia, 
he called on "the gentlelady from 
New York." 

"Gentlelady" may be the least 
appropriate title for Liz Holtzman. 
She has never seemed particularly 
gentle, either to her staff or to the 
press. Some call her aloof or uncom-
municative, others find her conde-
scending and on occasion even 
sanctimonious. Seymour Hersh, the 
New York Times investigative re-
porter, may have described her best 
of all. Hersh had been talking with 
Holtzman briefly in her office and on 
his way out he reportedly stopped 
long enough to say: "She's not a lot 
of laughs, is she?" 

On Capitol Hill that is a typical 
pageS 
reaction to Liz Holtzman. Bu t it is 
hardly the reaction of her constit-
uents in the 16th district of New 
York. "Wesawyouon t.v., an-
nounced a delighted old woman on 
one of Holtzman's recent visits to 
her district, "and the way you let 
them have it was very good." That is 
apparently the general feeling in 
Emanuel Celler's old Flatbush dis-
trict, a sense that they have found a 
tough replacement for Celler in the 
freslunan congresswoman from 
New York. In her first term Holtz-
man has acquired an impressive 
reputation as one of the most out-
spoken advocates{){ the liberal cause 
in the House of Representatives. 

It is a curious role for Liz Holtz-
man, who looks as if she might just 
as well be studying for her law 
boards. She is intense and distant, 
more comfortable with evidence than 
people, so ill at ease in person that it 
is difficult to imagine her in front of 
lights and cameras. But no one 
underestimates Liz Holtzman any-
more, especially since her perform-
ance last October during the hear-
ings into the pardon of Richard 
Nixon. 

The pardon hearings were an un-
expected twist for the committee 
that had fearlessly impeached 
Richard Nixon. This time, when 
Gerald Ford arrived to answer ques-
tions before the committee, the mem-
bers acted as if they were witnessing 
the arrival of the Messiah. William 
Hungate, the chairman for the occa-
sion, began by assuring the new 
President that he would not be kept 
past noon. Then, each member in 
turn thanked the President for the 
privilege of being with him. "It 
was,'' as the New York Times re-
ported, "as if Love Story had been 
presented as a sequel to Crime and 
Punishment." 

But the exception was once again 
Liz Holtzman. Without pausing for 
replies, Holtzman asked eight criti-
cal questions in rapid-fire, about 
"dark suspicions" that the pardon 
was part of a deal, about the secrecy 
of the decision, about whether the 
President would be willing to surren-
der tapes of his conversations with 
Richard Nixon. One editorial called 
her behavior "crude" and "boorish," 
and two columnists suggested paral-
lels to Joseph McCarthy. Larry 
Hogan, the first Republican to aban-
don Nixon only three months before, 
was offended by her "accusatory 
speech." But now it was Liz Holtz-
man, the shy congresswoman from 
New York, who dominated the occa-
sion. "I wondered," she concluded in 
her questions to Ford, "whether any-
body had brought your attention to 
the fact that the Constitution specif-
ically states that even though some-
body is impeached, that person shall 
nonetheless be liable to punishment 
under the law?" Ford had no time for 
a response. Liz Holtzman's time was 
up and the committee hurried on to 
finish its proceedings so that the 
President could get to lunch. Come 
to think of it, if Liz Holtzman weren't 
so nervous, maybe the committee 
would get nothing done at all. 0
