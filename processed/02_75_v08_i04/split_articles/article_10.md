students, the Special Committee will also attempt 
to insure that papers assigned in summer courses 
will not all fall due at the same time. This effort at 
coordination of course requirements could reduce 
the end-of-term crunch on summer students. 

If these ideas are accepted by the summer 
term faculty and succeed in their purpose, says 
Fanton, they could be introduced into theY ale cur-
riculum in the fall, but only if new staff and funding 
are available. 

Implicit in the suggestions of the Special 
Committee on Writing for the Summer Term is 
the recognition of two valid-and complemen-
tary-apprO,llChes to the teaching of writing. One 
way-providing for increased individual attention 
to students-offers a teacher familiar with the 
subject area of the course, and therefore know-
ledgeable in the special requirements of writing fo 
for that discipline. The second approach, which 
calls for a group of editors with little or no famil-
iarity with the subject, utilizes a basic knowledge 
of )low to write clear, precise English. 

Several departments at Yale have been using 
the first approach for many years. In the English 
department, for example, students are taught to 
write literary criticism. In the history department, 
a junior seminar (History 91) which emphasizes 
historical prose is required of majors before they 
write a senior essay. 

Many professors at Yale prefer the first 
approach. They argue that there is more to good 
·academic writing than correct English prose. 
· "There is a danger in learning to write without 
really writing anything," explains Cooke (who en-
dorses both approaches). The student must also 
learn to use his writing skills to focus and test his 
own ideas. Translating thoughts into words is . 
essential to learning: "Clear writing," Cooke con- . 
eludes, "is the result of clarified thinking.'; 

Cooke admits that many faculty members at 
Yale believe that readers who cannot understand 
highly specialized subjects are ignorant and there-
fore not worth reaching. This attitude is typified, 
he adds, by many modem poets. Many scholars 
denounce efforts to make specialized knowledge 
accessible to wider audiences as "gopularizing." 

The second appro~ch, now gaining increased 
acceptance among the faculty, does not deny the 
validity of writing for specialized disciplines. 1 ts 
proponents insist; however, that students who can 
write clear, clean sentences v.jll not only be able·to · 
translate their thoughts into words more easily, 
but will also be better able to make themselves 
understood. At a time when knowledge is increas-
ingly specialized, when interdisciplinary ap-
proaches to research are widely valued, shouldn't 
a student also be taught to write for an audience 
wider than the faculty of this department? 

Much of the extremely complex work being 
done in highly specialized areas obviously cannot 
be understood by anyone who is not familiar with 
the field. But much of this work could be more 
readily understood by people outside the field if it 
could be expressed in clear, concis~English, strip-
ped of jargon that is often vague and unnecessary. 

True, in some cases the simplification and gen-
eralization of complex subjects to make them more 
readily understandable can distort or misrepresent 
their significance. But at Yale today the teaching of 
clear, precise writing for a ~ore general audience 
than one's colleagues is gaining increased accep-
tance. For the first time in its history, the Universi-
ty endorses courses in the craft of writing, indepen-
dent of any one discipline. 

" ... if a man can keep his eyes open, distinguish 
facts from inferences, and write good English, a 
very little knowledge of history and economics and 
elementary law wiU go a great way.'' 
Arthur Twining Hadley, President of Yale from 
1899-1921, rejecting journalism training at Yale 

"We have become a fact-minded countrv," 
says William Zinsser, Master of Branford College, 
Editor of the Yale Alumni Magazine, and teacher of 
the highly successful "Non-Fiction Workshop" 
(English83-1b). "Socialchangeishappeningso 
fast-Women's Lib, advances in science, drugs, 
Civil Rights, sex-that people are inundated with 
facts. They ask 'what does it all mean?' They are 
looking for answers. 

The quickened pace of life, prompted largely 
by television, has made readers more impatient for 
those answers. No longer so willing to read a novel, 
they read newspapers, magazines, and longer non-
fiction works. Zinsser notes that several major 
American novelists-Norman Mailer andJ ames 
Baldwin, for instance-have turned from fiction to 
non-fiction, a trend he sees as' 'no accident. N on-fic-
tion has become the predominant literary form in 
America today.'' 

In most magazines today, according to Zins-
ser, non-fiction is "whattoday'swriterswrite, 
publishers publish, and readers read." 

The newspaper reporting of Watergate (with 
Robert Woodward, '65, in the front ranks), coupled 
with the rise of writer-heroes like Mailer, Tom 
Wolfe and Hunter Thompson, has sparked ana-
tionwide interest in what Zinsse~ aptly terms "the 
romance of journalism." The chance to topple gov-
ernments and expose corruption has inspired an 
awe of the media's power and attracted unprece-
dented numbers of young people to journalism. 

Columbia University's School of Journalism re-
ports that applications are up 48 per cent since 
. 1972; Northwestern reports similar statistics. Me-
dia organizations are swamped with job seekers, 
and no longer find recruiting necessary. 

The romance of journalism is eagerly pursued 
by Yale students. When Yale'sOffi<:eofPublic In• 
formation and theNew Haven Register jointly of-
fered a journalism internship, 40 students immed-
iately responded with applications. Overflow 
crowds of students have attended panel discus-
sions sponsored by the Poynter Fellowship in Jour-
nalism (established in 19~7 by Nels_on Poynter, 
M.A. '27, publisher of the St. Petersburg Times). 

Two newspapers and four undergraduate maga-
zines are curre:t;ttly published on campus. 

In response to this increased interest, the col-
lege seminar program has in the past five years in-
cluded course titles such as "Personal Journal-
ism, "taught by Loudon Wainwright, and" Jour-
nalism, the Art of the Fact," taught by Pulitzer 
Prize winner Thomas Powers, Yale '60. The swol-
len number of applicants to these courses has been 
interpreted by some as an adjunct to grim profes-
sionalism. 

But the teaser that draws many of these 
would-be writers is the chance to read and imitate 
cult heroes, many of whom have pried their way 
into journalism, stretched its limitations, and 
created what is lPOsely called "the New Journal-
ism." Writers such as Norman Mailer, Jimmy 
Breslin. Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson and Tom 
Wolfe draw freely from the resources of fiction 
and inject much of their own personalities into 
their writing. 

Tom Wolfe, who earned a Ph.D. from Yale in 
American Studies (he wrote his dissertation on po-
litical activities of American writers of the 1930's), 
writes frequently for New York magazine and first 
reached a large "counterculture" audience with his 
book The Electric Kool-AidAcid Test. Zinsser be-
lieve that Wolfe's writing is "exhilarating, but ex-
hausting on the optic nerve.'' 

HunterS. Thompson, inventor of "Gonzo" 
journalism (his own term) and the most outrage-
ously drug-crazed writer of all, cut his teeth writ-
ing features for The National Observer as their 
South American correspondent. He has chronicled 
his more recent adventures tn HeU's Angels; A 
$trange and Terrible Saga, Fear and Loathing in 
Las Vegas, FearandLoathingon the Campaign 
Tra4 (the 1972 presidential election) and Fear and 
Loathing at the Superbowl. 

These colorful and innovative writers, and 
others like them, have exposed students to the va-
riety of forms that personal expression can take. 
The college seminars which have sprung up in 
response are flooded with applications. 

But these courses, because they deal largely with a 
subject matter that runs the risk of becoming fad-
dish, generally have a short life span at Yale. They 
usually run for the two years allowed them in the 
college seminar program and disappear when no 
place is offered them in the academic departments. 
But they do encourage students to improve their 
writing on their own, in student publications, and 
in other writing courses. 

The longest running and most successful non· 
fiction writing course. and the only such course to 
complete the move from the seminar program to 
the English department, is Zinsser' s • 'Non-Ficti~n 
Workshop."


Zinsser brought the teaching of non-fiction 
writing-which he broadly defines as writing for 
publication in magazines and professional jour-
nals-toY ale as a Calhoun College seminar in the 
spring of 1971. It was absorbed into the English 
department in 1973. Because of continuing student 
demand, the English department offered a similar 
course last fall and this spring taught by Charles 
Elliott,aformercopyeditoratLIFEandnowa 
senior editor at Alfred Knopf &Company. 

Zinsser came toY ale almost by accident. A 
veteran of the now-defunct New York Herald Trib-
une. he had been a successful freelance writer in 
NewYorkandbeenaregularcolumnistforLIFE 
magazineforfiveyears.Butthesolitudeof 
sitting before a typewriter in his New York 
City apartment began to get to him so he tried 
tofindateachingjob.Atasummersession 
atlndiana University he found teaching to be 
"exhilarating," so he began to search for a 
JM>.rmanentjobatanexperimentalcollege. 

Much tQ his surprise, Yale called Zinsser. 
R. W.B. Lewis, then Master of Calhoun, invited 
him to teach a college seminar. Zinsser was eager 
to leaveN ew York, so he accepted. Soon after he 
had bought a house in New Haven, Zinsser received 
another call. The Yale Alumni Magazine needed an 
editor-was he interested? Though it seemed "an 
absurd thing for a middle-aged man from Prince-
ton to do," he accepted that, too. Threeyearslater, 
he accepted yet another Yale position -as Master 
of Branford College. 

Zinsser first taught his "Non-Fiction Work-
shop" in the spring of 1971. Teaching from his own 
experience, he hoped to exPOse his students to the 
llUlll¥ options OJ?eD to them as writers of non-fie· 
tion.Hesuggestedreadingsfromavarietyofnon-
fiction writers, and read excerpts in class from 
others. His students wrote one paper each week in 
a different area of non-fiction-the interview, the 
editorial, science writing, personal experience, 
feature writing. 

Above all, Zinsser emphasized craft. "Writ-
ing is a craft, like carpentry," he believes. He 
ruthlessly red-penciled clutter and jargon from his 
students' papers. He stressed organization, 
meaningful detail, and always, clarity. 

Fom the beginning, Zinsser knew what his 
course was not. It was not creative writing. It was 
not a course in journalism; he hoped to help stu-
dents with a wide range of interests, both academic 
and professional, to communicate their knowledge 
clearly. Today, he is careful to admit some' 'maver-
icks" to the course each year-students who have 
never written for publication. And he does not 
allow group criticism of student writing, each 
student receives his individual attention. 

Finally, the Workshop was not intended as a 
"career preparation" course. Although many of his 
students hope to write as a career (graduates of the 
course today work with a number of newspapers 
and magazines), Zinsser stresses that the best col-
lege preparation for writing is a strong liberal arts 
program, and the best post-graduate training is 
found on small newspapers and magazines. The 
"Non· Fiction Workshop" has been such a success 
at Yale that Zinsser has now written the basic prin-
ciples of his teaching into a book, to be published 
by Harper & Row as both a textbook and a gen-
eral interest work. 

As Yale seeks to raise the quality of student 
writing, it should consider the basic philosophy of 
writing that Zinsser teaches in his course. Stu-
dents who can write clearly for a general audience 
can also write clearly for their professors. Much of 
the jargon and imprecision which clouds student 
writing can and should be eliminated. Most of the 
lengthy papers cranked out in the wee hours of the 
morning could be condensed. A short, concise es-
say cannot be padded with lengthy quotes. If stu-
dents were encouraged to get to the point without 
concern for page length requirements, maybe they 
would not resort to the widespread practices of 
paddi.ng, cheating on margins, using typewriters 
with large typefaces, and even submitting other 
students' papers with a new tiUe page . . 

Richard W arch of the Special Committee on 
Writing for the Summer Term agrees that "a short 
paper written twice is probably better than a longer 
paper written once," especially in terms of writing 
quality. 

In a few years, the success of the University's 
efforts should be known. Maybe then Y aJe stu-
dents will ~ good writers. 0
