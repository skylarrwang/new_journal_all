**Title: Tales from the Judiciary Committee: The Ordeal of Elizabeth Holtzman**
**Author: Chris Whipple**
**Page number(s): 3**

Elizabeth Holtzman, the Democratic 
congresswoman from Brooklyn, sat 
nervously under the glare of the klieg 
lights of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee Room, waiting for her chance 
to say something. Caldwell Butler, 
the Republican from Virginia, had 
been droning on for ten minutes, de-
fending the first article of im~ach­
ment of Richard M. Nixon. Holtz-
man fumbled briefly with the papers 
on her desk, glanced impatiently at 
Chairman Rodino, and then looked 
straight at Butler with a menacing 
glare. Butler was supposed to speak 
for five minutes. Now he was on Liz 
Holtzman's time- and on her nerves 
as well. 


There were a lot of nerves on edge 
that night. It was the third day of 
the televised impeachment hearings 
and the comittee was tired, their 
staffs were tired, the reporters and 
technicians were tired. It had been 
seven months since the committee 
began compliling evidence-hearing 
witnesses, examining documents, 
and listening to John Doar recite 
endless points of evidence behind 
closed doors. Rodino and Doar were 
annoyed by Republican opposition 
on the day before and had been up 
all night re-drafting articles and 
assigning members to compile more 
evidence for the debate. Rodino 
looked exhausted.' Tom Railsback, as 
usual, looked distressed. 


But at that moment Liz Holtzman 
looked the most distressed of all-es-
pecially to her staff across the street 
in room 1009 of the Longworth House 
Office Building. Most of the offices 
were empty that day and Holtzman's 
staff was gathered around a tele-
vision set waiting for her speech. As 
an intern on Holtzman's staff, I had 
spent the morning with other interns 
looking up obscure quotations in 
books of committee evidence eo that 
Holtzman would be ready to speak 
that afternoon. But Caldwell Butler 
had not yet finished his recital. Liz 
Holtzman's time was up-and so was 
her patience. 


That was not unusual. As volun-
teers in Holtzman's office, we were 
accustomed to her occasionally irri-
table moods. For the last week she 
had been working sixteen to twenty 
hours a day. Three days before, the 
Supreme Court had ruled 8-0 that 
Richard Nixon would have to sur-
render the remaining White House 
tapes. Impeachment was inevitable, 
the hearings were televised, the pace 
was picking up. ·Holtzman had been 
writing her own articles of impeach-
ment, preparing statements, and 
getting ready to debate the evidence 
when she was called. 


But not that day, because Rodino 
had giveri Butler the OK to continue. 
It was no surprise by then that the 
Republicans got the call. Impeach-
ment was assured, and the Demo-
cratic strategy was to come up with 
as many pro-impeachment Repub-
licans as possible. Rumor had it that 
Butler, the Republican, had been lis-
tening to his wife read All The Pres-
ident's Men to him at bedside. And 
his opening statement three days 
before had been surprisingly direct: 
" I am not unmindful of the loyalty 
I owe him," he had said of Nixon to 
his Republican colleagues, "but 
Watergate is our shame ... These 
things have happened in our house, 
and it is our responsibility to clear it 
up ... throughout the extensive tran-
scripts made available to us of inti-
mate Presidential conversation and 
discussion there is no evidence of 
regret ... or reflection upon the basic 
obligations of the Presidency. In 
short, power seems to have corrup-
ted." 


It was partly Holtzman's lack of 
. power on the committee that made 
her situation so uncomfortable. The 
heavies were Chairman Rodino, 
Counsel Doar, and such senior Dem-
ocrats as James Mann of South 
Carolina and Paul Sarbanes of Mary-
land. 'l'hey were the ones who took 
part in the deliberations-the ones 
who drafted the articles of impeach-
ment. Rodino and the senior Demo-
crats determined who would speak 
and when and what the ultimate 
strategy would be. Then there was 
the celebrated "swing" group, the 
undecided Republicans and Southern 
Democrats who were crucial to the 
final vote. Holtzman·belonged to 
neither. She was a freshman Demo-
crat, her vote was certain, her ability 
untested. Holtzman had to go her 
own way. 


And that was just·as well, because 
Liz Holtzman is a loner. It is remark-
able that she got to the committee in 
the first place. Marilyn Shapiro, her 
"administrative assistant" and the 
only one who sees much of her at all, 
confesses that no one thought she 
had a chance to unseat Emanuel 
Celler, the incumbent since 1923 and 
former chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee. Celler reportedly com-
pared Holtzman, a graduate of Rad-
cliffe (magna cum laude) and Har-
vard Law, to "a toothpick trying to 
topple the Washington Monument.'' 
At 32, inexperienced in national poli-
tics, Holtzman pulled off something 
of a miracle. She did it without much 
help from anyone-including John 
Lindsay, her former boss, or Bella 
Abzug, her fellow Congresswoman 
from New York. But by unseating 
Cellar, she may have fulfilled Bella's 
prophesy. Cellar once said that he op-
posed the Equal Rights Amendment 
because. after all, there were no 
womenattheLastSupper. ~'There 
may have been no women at the Last 
Supper," responded Abzug. "but 
there damned well will be women at 
the next one. •• 


There was a certain irony in Holtz-
man's triumph that was even more 
remarkable than the odds she over-
came. Holtzman owed her election 
almost solely to her getting out and 
talking personally to the voters.
