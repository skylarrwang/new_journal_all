The inheritance of physical and instinc-
tive traits is a direct result of gene 
transmission, the study of genetics. 
A 
gene is one of 100,000 in each cell of the 
body, along with 46 chromosomes. 
The 
materials RNA and DNA and protein are the 
three basic ingredients of a chromosome.

Several years ago, when women at 
Yale were still outnumbered ten to 
one, I attended a meeting at the 
Alumni House on involving more 
female graduates in alumni•func-
tions. Someone mentioned the Yale 
Club of New York, recounting how 
annoyed his wife always became be-
cause she was not allowed to eat in 
the dining hall at certain hours. My 
picket-pig-Mory's adrenalin started 
pumping. 


Then, a woman staff member of 
the Alumni House, who by her dress, 
make-up and polite deference to the 
director seemed to be his secretary, 
spoke for the first time all meeting. 
She said that she had entered the 
elevator at the Club one evening 
wearing a pants suit-she traced the 
imaginary creased flairs and long-
belted tunic-and was told by the 
operator that women were not allow-
ed in pants. "I won't take you up in 
those, lady.'' She calmly unzipped 
and removed her elegant bottoms, 
left them in a heap by the astonished 
attendant, and got off at her floor. 


We left the meeting together, talk-
ing about Yale's guilty, schizophren-
ic attitude toward women. On the 
one hand, the gallant-"Yes, we love 
women," as one French professor 
told me; on the other, "No, we won't 
admit them on an equal ratio with 
men." I found out later that this 
"secretary" was the assistant direc-
tor of the Alumni House. 


Since then, thi.ngs have changed. 
When I talk to undergraduates 
about ratios and quotas, they act as 
if I'm lecturing on ancient history. 
One sophomore told me how grateful 
she was to us pioneers who had gone 
before and made her life easier. And I 
no longer mistake assistant directors 
for secretaries. Women are equal 
participants in all aspects of Yale 
life-undergraduate and alumni-or 
are they? 


All the women I saw at theY ale 
Club one recent afternoon wore pants 
except me. All eight of them. Three 
were secretaries who rode the eleva-
tor with me to the seventh floor 
administrative offices where I want-
ed to inquire about filing a member-
ship application. I wasn't interested 
in joining-using the barbershop, 
banquet rooms, limousine service 
and valet. I simply wanted to snoop. 
A friend had just shot a scene from 
her underground film 
in the dining 
room where women are not allowed 
to eat dinner. I thought I'd check out 
the set. 


Miss G, in charge of membership, 
looked like all the other women in 
Yale offices, without whom the uni-
versity would collapse-fortyish, 
New England tailored, helpful, effi-
cient, and determined to guard the 
corridors of power. 


She gave me an application and 
the list of admissions committee 
members, two of whom must sign in 
order to be admitted. I glanced at 
their business addresses, in case I 
decided to contact someone-there 
was Madden. Plunket, Wetzel, and 
Scott, yes, that William J. Mad-
den, '62, and then James Preston, 
'67, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Mea-
gher and Flom, or was it Skadden, 
Madden, Slarps, Flott and-she 
whisked the paper away. Then she let 
me glimpse at the card with the fee 
scale, 10 per cent less for women, she 
explained, because "you can't use 
the fifth floor yet. The pool and 
S&llll;& baths, and steam room, you 
know, are off limits." She spoke rev-
erently, as if a bank vault were 
secreted there. "When will they be 
renovated to accomodate women?" I 
asked in my best trouble-maker tone. 
"Soon, I'm sure. Just wait." A pink 
blush peaked behind her rouge. I 
could see she was imagining naked 
men running around in towels. So 
was I. 


"I'm not a swimmer," I said, "but 
I would like to play squash." She 
smiled, delighted to tell me that 
since July, all the squash facilities 
were open to women-at $1.00 per 
fifteen minutes per court, with reser-
vations. Why did I feel so uncomfort-
able? Because of the double figure 
dues, paid "quarterly?" Because I 
needed an hour for a good work-out 
and would have to join Floro, Flun-
ket and Scoot before I could afford 
it? 


Miss G was being very friendly. 
No barriers. I was paranoid. I asked 
if I could look around, check out the 
facilities. She was horrified, her 
rouge spotting, "You can't just 
wander around on your own, that 
wouldn't do." The naked men on the 
fifth floor? Perhaps a nude swim-in 
was just the thing to liberate the 
place. 


She picked up the phone and made 
a few calls to find me a guide. Every-
one was "out to lunch." "Can't I just 
go up to the library and read? I've 
got some time to kill before ... " "No, 
I'm sorry, you might get stopped." 
Perhaps, like at the Pentagon, mem-
bers wore ID badges. 


I played my trump. " A friend of 
mine knows Mr. L, the manager, she 
made a film here. Can I see him?" 
(The movie was neo-Warhol, but he 
didn't have to know that.) "The 
manager?" Her face lit up. "Of 
course I'll call him." But he too was 
out to lunch. "Why don't you go 
down to the lobby to wait," she 
suggested. "We'll call you as soon as 
he's in." 


I waited nervously in the lobby-
plush and bustling like an ad 
agency-flipping through News-
week, Cue, Esquire, Vogue, studying 
the diagram of the Yale Bowl, my 
legs sticking to the Moroccan leather 
lounge chairs. I checked the display 
of club ties, the brochures on tours to 
Africa. 


Traffic around me was brisk-all 
shapes, sizes, and ages of conserv-
ative businessmen left the dining 
room, checked baggage and occa-
sionally squired a svelte woman. 
None of the women looked like alum-
nae. The atmosphere, including the 
Moroccan leather, exuded off-hand 
politeness, efficient snobbery and 
money. 


I investigated the ladies room. 
Marble sinks and elegantly stained 
wooden stall doors. 


I listened to the interactions, 
punctuated with words like market, 
benefits, sailboat. A silver-haired 
woman came in, pants and cape, ner-
vously peering. Immediately, a blue-
uniformed guard buttonholed her-
" Lady, what can I do for you?" 
"Over there, lady." She rang up 
someone at the hotel and sat oppo-
site me, her wan smile mirroring my 
own discomfort. 


An hour and a half passed. I re-
membered that I had bought a new 
paperback-Erica Jong-and pulled 
it out, hoping the dirty cover would 
get a rise out of someone. "The most 
uninhibited, delicious, erotic novel a 
woman ever wrote," John Updike 
blurbed on the cover. But I felt in-
creasingly anxious, untitillated, 
reading about a fantasy in an Italian 
train between a soldier and a widow. 
Most of the other loungees had Wall 
Street Journals. 


"Mr. L," someone said across the 
lobby, and I perked up. A man with 
polished loafers that curled up slight-
ly at the toes and with sleek grey 
hair that also curled up slightly, like 
Liberace's, slid over to the guard 
who had called him. He clutched a 
manila poster, announcing some 
football weekend gala. He and the 
guard argued where to hang it, by 
the front door, or by the dining hall. 
The doorman was obsequious, Mr. L 
this, Mr. L that. I wondered whether 
to announce myself. My friend said 
that he had been incredibly helpful 
on her film, even offering to take her 
to dinner when it was finished. But 
when she had called to say she had a 
friend in town, would he like to have 
a drink with us this week, he was 
busy with a hotel convention. Was 
he embarrassed that she had called 
his bluff? I decided to wait for Miss 
G to call me. 


Sure enough, a few minutes later, 
after Mr. L parted with the guard, 
she appeared, "Mr. L called from 
lunch to say he would be tied up in a 
conference all afternoon," she oozed, 
oh so polite. "He can't see you."


**Title: Tales from the Judiciary Committee: The Ordeal of Elizabeth Holtzman**
**Author: Chris Whipple**
**Page number(s): 3**

Elizabeth Holtzman, the Democratic 
congresswoman from Brooklyn, sat 
nervously under the glare of the klieg 
lights of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee Room, waiting for her chance 
to say something. Caldwell Butler, 
the Republican from Virginia, had 
been droning on for ten minutes, de-
fending the first article of im~ach­
ment of Richard M. Nixon. Holtz-
man fumbled briefly with the papers 
on her desk, glanced impatiently at 
Chairman Rodino, and then looked 
straight at Butler with a menacing 
glare. Butler was supposed to speak 
for five minutes. Now he was on Liz 
Holtzman's time- and on her nerves 
as well. 


There were a lot of nerves on edge 
that night. It was the third day of 
the televised impeachment hearings 
and the comittee was tired, their 
staffs were tired, the reporters and 
technicians were tired. It had been 
seven months since the committee 
began compliling evidence-hearing 
witnesses, examining documents, 
and listening to John Doar recite 
endless points of evidence behind 
closed doors. Rodino and Doar were 
annoyed by Republican opposition 
on the day before and had been up 
all night re-drafting articles and 
assigning members to compile more 
evidence for the debate. Rodino 
looked exhausted.' Tom Railsback, as 
usual, looked distressed. 


But at that moment Liz Holtzman 
looked the most distressed of all-es-
pecially to her staff across the street 
in room 1009 of the Longworth House 
Office Building. Most of the offices 
were empty that day and Holtzman's 
staff was gathered around a tele-
vision set waiting for her speech. As 
an intern on Holtzman's staff, I had 
spent the morning with other interns 
looking up obscure quotations in 
books of committee evidence eo that 
Holtzman would be ready to speak 
that afternoon. But Caldwell Butler 
had not yet finished his recital. Liz 
Holtzman's time was up-and so was 
her patience. 


That was not unusual. As volun-
teers in Holtzman's office, we were 
accustomed to her occasionally irri-
table moods. For the last week she 
had been working sixteen to twenty 
hours a day. Three days before, the 
Supreme Court had ruled 8-0 that 
Richard Nixon would have to sur-
render the remaining White House 
tapes. Impeachment was inevitable, 
the hearings were televised, the pace 
was picking up. ·Holtzman had been 
writing her own articles of impeach-
ment, preparing statements, and 
getting ready to debate the evidence 
when she was called. 


But not that day, because Rodino 
had giveri Butler the OK to continue. 
It was no surprise by then that the 
Republicans got the call. Impeach-
ment was assured, and the Demo-
cratic strategy was to come up with 
as many pro-impeachment Repub-
licans as possible. Rumor had it that 
Butler, the Republican, had been lis-
tening to his wife read All The Pres-
ident's Men to him at bedside. And 
his opening statement three days 
before had been surprisingly direct: 
" I am not unmindful of the loyalty 
I owe him," he had said of Nixon to 
his Republican colleagues, "but 
Watergate is our shame ... These 
things have happened in our house, 
and it is our responsibility to clear it 
up ... throughout the extensive tran-
scripts made available to us of inti-
mate Presidential conversation and 
discussion there is no evidence of 
regret ... or reflection upon the basic 
obligations of the Presidency. In 
short, power seems to have corrup-
ted." 


It was partly Holtzman's lack of 
. power on the committee that made 
her situation so uncomfortable. The 
heavies were Chairman Rodino, 
Counsel Doar, and such senior Dem-
ocrats as James Mann of South 
Carolina and Paul Sarbanes of Mary-
land. 'l'hey were the ones who took 
part in the deliberations-the ones 
who drafted the articles of impeach-
ment. Rodino and the senior Demo-
crats determined who would speak 
and when and what the ultimate 
strategy would be. Then there was 
the celebrated "swing" group, the 
undecided Republicans and Southern 
Democrats who were crucial to the 
final vote. Holtzman·belonged to 
neither. She was a freshman Demo-
crat, her vote was certain, her ability 
untested. Holtzman had to go her 
own way. 


And that was just·as well, because 
Liz Holtzman is a loner. It is remark-
able that she got to the committee in 
the first place. Marilyn Shapiro, her 
"administrative assistant" and the 
only one who sees much of her at all, 
confesses that no one thought she 
had a chance to unseat Emanuel 
Celler, the incumbent since 1923 and 
former chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee. Celler reportedly com-
pared Holtzman, a graduate of Rad-
cliffe (magna cum laude) and Har-
vard Law, to "a toothpick trying to 
topple the Washington Monument.'' 
At 32, inexperienced in national poli-
tics, Holtzman pulled off something 
of a miracle. She did it without much 
help from anyone-including John 
Lindsay, her former boss, or Bella 
Abzug, her fellow Congresswoman 
from New York. But by unseating 
Cellar, she may have fulfilled Bella's 
prophesy. Cellar once said that he op-
posed the Equal Rights Amendment 
because. after all, there were no 
womenattheLastSupper. ~'There 
may have been no women at the Last 
Supper," responded Abzug. "but 
there damned well will be women at 
the next one. •• 


There was a certain irony in Holtz-
man's triumph that was even more 
remarkable than the odds she over-
came. Holtzman owed her election 
almost solely to her getting out and 
talking personally to the voters.

**Liz Holtzman and the Impeachment Hearings**
**Author: Chris Whipple**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

Those who are accustomed to her 
Washington behavior fmd that diffi-
cult to imagine. In Washington, 
Holtzman seldom has the time or in-
clination to talk to her own staff, and 
when she does she looks so nervous 
that she makes even her shyest in-
terns feel at ease. She is constantly 
intense, impatient with intruders, 
uncomfortable with any kind of 
small talk that might keep her from 
her work. 
But when Liz Holtzman is out 
campaigning in the streets of Flat-
bush, in her Brooklyn district, she 
undergoes what seems to be a total 
transformation. "You ought to see 
her with her constituents," remarks 
one of her Washington staff in dis-
belief, "she is warm, compassionate, 
understanding .. .it's because they 
aren't really people; they're constit-
uents." Whatever they are, Holtz-
man treats them more like people 
than Celler ever did, who never 
bothered to maintain an office in his 
district and seldom ventured out of 
Washington to keep in touch. Holtz-
man regularly turns down speaking 
invitations to spend one day a week 
with her constituents. And they re-
spond in kind. Last month Holtzman 
took the oath of office for a second 
term after capturing 78.6 per cent of 
the vote. 

Holtzman's Washington staff 
must set some sort of record for 
being underpaid and overworked. 
Marilyn, who has been with her since 
they both worked for Lindsay, is the 
first to admit that Holtzman is not 
an easy-going type. This results in 
a fairly rapid tum-over on her staff; 
they seem to come and go nearly as 
fast as they are hired. During the Im-
peachment hearings Holtzman 
worked in nearly total isolation from 
her staff. On our arrival we were told 
by Marilyn that whenever Liz was on 
her way to the office we were to make 
ourselves as scarce as possible. So 
when Liz was on her way from the 
committee we would retreat down 
the hall to the annex. Like Wood-
ward.and Bernstein, Holtzman goes 
her own way without a family to tie 
her down. But unlike either Wood-
ward or Bernstein, she has no appar-
ent social life to distract her from her 
work. 

She has never been a favorite of 
the committee, but Liz Holtzman is 
respected for her obvious legal 
talent. Larry Hogan, the Republican 
from Maryland, spoke of her ten-
dency "to face the world with a chip 
on her shoulder," but added that she 
"is very bright, brilliant, hard work-
ing, dedicated." No one argues with 
that estimation. It was Holtzman's 
lawsuit, for example, that very near-
ly ended the bombing of Cambodia 
not too long ago (Justice Douglas 
sustained her suit that the bombing 
was unconstitutional but the full 
court was hastily convened to over-
rule him). And it was Holtzman's 
questioning that caught Gerald Ford 
contradicting himself in his Vice-
Presidential confirmation hearings. 

So as the televised hearings began 
and Holtzman waited for her turn to 
speak, there was no question that 
she knew the evidence cold. What 
she would do with it in front of all the 
lights and cameras was another 
matter. Holtzman seemed oddly out 
The New Journal/February 14, 1975 
of place-uncomfortable with the 
hearings despite her obvious prepa-
ration for them. I recall one day 
when she was charging around the 
office, waving a copy of the New 
York Times above her head. Her pic-
ture was spread across the first page. 
She was overwhelmed by it-de-
lighted, but maybe just a little 
scared as well. 

It was, after all, a proceeding of 
high theater as well as history, no 
ordinary meeting of the House Judi-
ciary Committee. Three days before, 
the day the televised hearings began, 
Holtzman had to wait her turn while 
the senior members delivered their 
opening fifteen-minute monologues. 
The scene outside room 2141 of the 
Rayburn Building resembled the 
stage of a musical comedy before the 
curtain has gone up. Police were 
swarming in the corridors, reporters 
were badgering each other, ex-
changing notes, waiting for the solo-
ists to appear. Some demonstra-
tors-mostly middle-aged and 
matronly-were holding a "Fast for 
Nixon" outside. Curiously, impeach-
ment seemed to arouse only fanatics. 
Roger Mudd was questioning Rodino 
around the comer from the commit-
tee room when someone yelled, "Ask 
Rodino why his Jewish Mafia friends 
are fucking the impeachment!" An 
armed escort showed him to the 
door. 

Inside room 2141 no one was un-
moved by the occasion. Liz Holtz-
man's mother was sitting in the staff 
seat provided to each committee 
member. On previous occasions, 
when I had occupied it myself, I 
imagined that I saw Liz Holtzman 
wondering who the hell I was. Now 
she was probably wondering what to 
say in her first speech the following 
day. 

At 7:45 in the evening, Chairman 
Rodino called the meeting to order. 
It was Rodino who had charted the 
impeachment process through uncer-
tain territory and under bitter oppo-
sition from all sides. He had set the 
tone for the proceedings in his open-
ing remarks: "The committee must 
now decide a question of the highest 
Constitutional importance," he said, 
and then quoting Edmund Burke, "it 
is by this tribunal that statesmen 
who abuse their power are accused 
by statesmen and tried by states-
men, not upon the niceties of narrow 
jurisprudence, but upon the enlarged 
and solid principles of state mor-
ality ... Let us go forward ... Whatever 
we now decide we must have the 
integrity and the decency, the will 
and the courage, to decide right ... " 

Since that first day, Holtzman had 
been re-drafting her own statement 
while the other members followed 
Rodino's lead. They avoided "narrow 
jurisprudence" and spoke eloquently 
about the larger picture. It was an 
impressive collection of speeches-
a virtuoso performance for members 
of the House of Representatives, who 
were better known as party hacks 
and undistinguished politicians. 

"Here the issue is the Constitution," 
said Hamilton Fish, "and in asses-
sing the fitness of the President for 
remaining in office the Congress be-
comes the conscience and protector 
of the State." Walter Flowers, the 
conservative white Southerner,

TheNewJournol!February 14,1975 
seemed to have been struggling with 
his conscience. His speech may have 
been the most eloquent of all: 
Our problem is not now to find 
better values, but I say our prob-
lem is to be faithful to those we 
profess and make them live in 
modem times ... 'We the people of 
the United States,' and surely 
there is no more inspiring phrase 
than this- 'We, the people of the 
United States,' not we the public 
officials of the United States, not 
we the certified experts, or we the 
educated, or we the grown-ups 
over twenty-one or twenty-five, 
not we the privileged classes, or 
whatever, butjustsimply 'We, the 
people ... We, acting in our com-
munities across the nation, can 
pull our fragmented nation to-
gether ... 

So on the second day, when Liz 
Holtzman gave her fifteen-minute 
statement, she had reason to be ner-
vous. She was not about to steal the 
show. Holtzman, 36th in seniority 
out of 38 members, had heard other 
members make many of her points 
already; and Barbara Jordan, the 
massive black congresswoman from 
Texas,hadjustknockedthewind 
out of the galleries with her remarks. 
Jordan had become one of the favor-
ites on the committee, respected for 
her eloquence and for her thundering 
delivery. In contrast, Holtzman, 
looking pale and slight behind her 
hornrimmed glasses, spoke in a fal-
tering voice. While most of the other 
members were staring blankly into 
space or jotting notes, she began, 
"Mr. Chairman, as we sit here to 
measure President Nixon's conduct 
against the standard set in the Con-
stitution of the United States each 
one of us has questioned what the 
Constitution means ... and each mem-
ber on the committee is publicly 
groping for the right thing to do ... " 
in fact, as everyone on the committee 
knew, Liz Holtzman had never exact-
ly "groped" for the right thing to do. 
She had been a sure vote for im-
peachment all along. Now she was 
groping for the right words to intro-
duce the list of evidence she had pre-
pared. She continued, "it is prin-
cipally out of the President's own 
mouth and through his own words 
that we find the strongest evidence 
of the high crimes and misdemeanors 
he has committed ... " Now she 
seemed to be recovering her poise 
and spoke defiantly- if just a little 
nervously-quoting Nixon on the 
subject of the FBI, the CIA, the pay-
ment of hush money to defendants, 
offers of executive clemency and so 
on. She lacked the eloquence of J or-
dan, but by the end of her speech, as 
she recommended that the commit-
tee vote to impeach the President, 
Holtzman was looking more relaxed. 

Across the street in Holtzman's 
office, Marilyn, who had been watch-
ing nervously, looked visibly re-
lieved. There was nothing remark-
able about her opening speech, 
except perhaps the fact that Liz 
Holtzman, the shy congresswoman 
from New York, had begun to warm 
to the occasion. 

If she seemed a little nervous on 
her opening night, that was hardly 
unexpected. But what Holtzman 
lacked in poise that night she made 
up for in her first real test the follow-
ing day. The opening fifteen-minute 
statements were only the ground-
work for the actual debate. On the 
substance of the articles of impeach-
ment Holtzman came as well pre-
pared as any of her senior colleagues. 
On the first day of the debate on 
Article I, Holtzman came to the 
assistance of the senior Democrats 
on a point of obscure law. Paul Sar-
banes·had been assigned to introduce 
the first article of impeachment, and 
he had run into some unexpected 
trouble. Charles Wiggins, Nixon's 
most articulate defender, asked when 
the "policy" to obstruct justice had 
literally begun. Charles Sandman, 
another Nixon supporter, closed in. 
"Is it your understanding of the 
law," he asked, "that the articles of 
impeachment must be specific ... ?" 
"Wouldn't it be a damning indict-
ment," Wiggins added, "if this com-
mittee, if after all this time and 
money we were unable to state with 
specificity what this case is all 
about?" Sarbanes looked confused. 
Hardly anyone, it seemed, had been 
prepared to deal with "specificity." 
Except for Liz Holtzinan. "It's 
true," she countered, "that earlier 
impeachment hearings pleaded very 
specific language. It's also true at 
that tim~ that they were based on 
general civic practice which required 
factual pleading. We abandoned that 
system in 1938: .. and have been oper-
ating on a notice pleading system 
which has been held innumerable 
times to supply the defendants due 
process of law." I doubt that her con-
stituents understood it, but Holtz-
man was beginning to make her 
points to the Committee in her inimi-
table way. Although uncomfortable 
with her opening speech, Holtzman 
delivered lectures to her colleagues 
when debating minute points of 
evidence or law. 

By the time of the debate on the 
secret bombing of Cambodia and 
Nixon's tax evasion (the articles that 
did not pass), Holtzman was leading 
the debate in what was unfortunate-
ly a losing cause. Most of the mem-
bers agreed that the bombing of 
Cambodia was an impeachable 
offense; they disagreed on whether 
Congress had approved the Pres-
ident's action. "I am not saying," 
snapped Holtzman, "that if the 
secret bombing were made public 
that the Congress would not have 
approved it. Congress may very well 
have approved it. But it was the 
right of Congress to have approved it 
and it was the right of Congress to 
have known and it was the right of 
the people to have approved it. That 
is the point that is made here and 
that is the reason for the seriousness 
of the President's actions." So effec-
tive was Liz Holtzman in the debate 
on Nixon's taxes that Sandman, who 
apparently could think of nothing 
else, accused her of libeling the Pres-
ident. Toward the end, when Cald-
well Butler need a "chief resource 
person" on the subject of Cambodia, 
he called on "the gentlelady from 
New York." 

"Gentlelady" may be the least 
appropriate title for Liz Holtzman. 
She has never seemed particularly 
gentle, either to her staff or to the 
press. Some call her aloof or uncom-
municative, others find her conde-
scending and on occasion even 
sanctimonious. Seymour Hersh, the 
New York Times investigative re-
porter, may have described her best 
of all. Hersh had been talking with 
Holtzman briefly in her office and on 
his way out he reportedly stopped 
long enough to say: "She's not a lot 
of laughs, is she?" 

On Capitol Hill that is a typical 
pageS 
reaction to Liz Holtzman. Bu t it is 
hardly the reaction of her constit-
uents in the 16th district of New 
York. "Wesawyouon t.v., an-
nounced a delighted old woman on 
one of Holtzman's recent visits to 
her district, "and the way you let 
them have it was very good." That is 
apparently the general feeling in 
Emanuel Celler's old Flatbush dis-
trict, a sense that they have found a 
tough replacement for Celler in the 
freslunan congresswoman from 
New York. In her first term Holtz-
man has acquired an impressive 
reputation as one of the most out-
spoken advocates{){ the liberal cause 
in the House of Representatives. 

It is a curious role for Liz Holtz-
man, who looks as if she might just 
as well be studying for her law 
boards. She is intense and distant, 
more comfortable with evidence than 
people, so ill at ease in person that it 
is difficult to imagine her in front of 
lights and cameras. But no one 
underestimates Liz Holtzman any-
more, especially since her perform-
ance last October during the hear-
ings into the pardon of Richard 
Nixon. 

The pardon hearings were an un-
expected twist for the committee 
that had fearlessly impeached 
Richard Nixon. This time, when 
Gerald Ford arrived to answer ques-
tions before the committee, the mem-
bers acted as if they were witnessing 
the arrival of the Messiah. William 
Hungate, the chairman for the occa-
sion, began by assuring the new 
President that he would not be kept 
past noon. Then, each member in 
turn thanked the President for the 
privilege of being with him. "It 
was,'' as the New York Times re-
ported, "as if Love Story had been 
presented as a sequel to Crime and 
Punishment." 

But the exception was once again 
Liz Holtzman. Without pausing for 
replies, Holtzman asked eight criti-
cal questions in rapid-fire, about 
"dark suspicions" that the pardon 
was part of a deal, about the secrecy 
of the decision, about whether the 
President would be willing to surren-
der tapes of his conversations with 
Richard Nixon. One editorial called 
her behavior "crude" and "boorish," 
and two columnists suggested paral-
lels to Joseph McCarthy. Larry 
Hogan, the first Republican to aban-
don Nixon only three months before, 
was offended by her "accusatory 
speech." But now it was Liz Holtz-
man, the shy congresswoman from 
New York, who dominated the occa-
sion. "I wondered," she concluded in 
her questions to Ford, "whether any-
body had brought your attention to 
the fact that the Constitution specif-
ically states that even though some-
body is impeached, that person shall 
nonetheless be liable to punishment 
under the law?" Ford had no time for 
a response. Liz Holtzman's time was 
up and the committee hurried on to 
finish its proceedings so that the 
President could get to lunch. Come 
to think of it, if Liz Holtzman weren't 
so nervous, maybe the committee 
would get nothing done at all. 0

by Stuart Rohrer 
Are Yale students good writers? 
At a university that produced the likes of 
Sinclair Lewis, Thornton Wilder, Steven Vincent 
~enet, John Hersey, John Knowles and Calvin 
Trillin; where Robert Penn Warren, Arthur Mil-
ler, Norman Mailer and a host of others have 
taught on the faculty or visited through fellow-
ship programs, one would expect good under-
graduate writing. 

There is certainly great interest in writing on 
campus today. Attendance at programs featuring 
writers and journalists has been overwhelming. 
Writing courses are swamped with applications. 
Yale students are clearly writing more than 
ever before. It is not uncommon for an under-
graduate to chum out 60 to 100 pages of academic 
papers each term. And student writing fills the 
pages of a diverse group of undergraduate pub-
lications. 

But do these students write well? 
Not well enough. Among the faculty and ad-
ministration, there is, in the words of one con-
cerned faculty member, "a widely shared view 
that student writing needs attention." 

In the coming year, beginning with the sum-
mer term, the University will inaugurate new cour-
ses and programs designed to raise the quality of 
student writing. At last, Yale recognizes the teach-
ing of writing skills as a University obligation. 
Hopefully, the University will also recognize that 
the ability to communicate ideas clearly is essen-
tial to a modem education. 

1 
It is a commonplace that educated men and women 
should be able to express themselves clearly in 
their own language, both in speech and in writing. 
It is a frequent illusion to suppose that one can 
think clearly if he cannot write clearly: words are 
the basic tools of thought. If a person cannot use 
them skillfully, he will be handicapped not only in 
communicating his ideas to anyone else, but also in 
devewping, defining, and understanding them 
himself. 

from "Guidelines" in Yale College Programs of 
Study 

Michael Cooke, Professor of English and direc-
tor of undergraduate studies in the English depart-
. ment, offers a favorite metaphor to describe the ba-
sic elements of training in English -a cart with 
four wheels representing fiction, poetry, drama and 
expository writing. He comments, "We've been ri-
ding on three wheels for too long." 

Traditionally, the English department has 
assumed the responsibility for teaching students to 
write. Until aoout fifteen years ago, every fresh-
man was required to take English 10-freshman 
composition. Laying down rules for organiza-
tion -the paragraph and the topic sentence-and 
polishing grammar supposedly mastered in high 
school and prep school, English 10 prepared stu-
dents to write expository prose about English liter-
ature. The basic principles served for writing in 
other subject area.s as well. 

For those who were serious about writing for 
publication, Yale offered Daily Themes (today's 
English 80 ), the oldest fiction-writing course in 
America and one of the few writing courses that 
have survived the changes of the past seven de-
cades. First offered around 1905, the course for 
many years included a year-long sequence which 
taught narrative, descriptive, argumentative and 
expository prose. From 1910through theearly 
1920's,taught by Professor John Berdan, Daily 
Themes attracted many of Yale's most famous a-
lumni writers, including Henry Luce, Thornton 
Wilder and Archibald MacLeish. 

(Today's Daily Themes, taught by Associate 
Professor Edward Gordon, concentrates exclusive-
lyon creative writing, emphasizing the virtue of 
clarity. Formerly limited to 45 students, it now has 
been expanded toaccomodate75.) 

But Daily Themes has never been a required 
course, and in the late 1950's, English 10 became an 
elective as weU. Yale demanded only that a student 
take one year of English. Those in need of remedial 
help were offered a special course in basic reading 
and writing skills. 

Finally, in the early 1960's, Yale dropped all 
requirements. Incoming freshman were instead 
given " Guidelines" to assist them in course selec-
tion. Predictably, the guidelines insisted on the 
necessity of training in English. The success of 
these guidelines is evident: about 90 per cent of 
Yale's incoming freshmen enroll in English cour-
ses. 

But these introductory courses- English 15, 
25, and 29- now emphasize English literature 
more than basic writing skills. There is now no 
guarantee that Yale undergraduates will enroU in 
courses that emphasize writing. 

Cooke concedes that the quality of student 
writing in the English department today "has not 
come up to our expectations." Professors, absorb-
ed in their own work and writing, leave the bulk of 
undergraduate teaching duties to the junior faculty 
and teaching assistants. These teachers, likewise 
overburdened, do not have time to offer close atten-
tion to student writing problems. 

The English department now intends tore-em-
phasize expository writing. A new sophomore 
writing seminar will make its debut in the summer 
term. Next faU, three new faculty members will be 
added to first-term English 15 sections to permit 
increased attention to basic expository skills. 

"These changes are part of a constant self-revis-
ion'' of the department, says Cooke. ''We needed 
a change." 

But concern over the quality of student writ-
ing is not limited to the English department. 
Eighteen months ago, responding to a general view 
that student writing needed more attention, Pres-
ident Brewster called together a group of faculty 
members to discuss what could be done on a Uni-
versity-wide basis. 

One proposal written after that meeting sug-
gested that all students be required to take a 
"Freshman Essay" seminar in their residential col-
lages. Close attention to writing skills would be em-
phasized as students wrote essays on general top-
ics chosen by their instructors. This proposal was 
~nsidered seriously, and educational foundations 
were approached for the funds needed to imple-
ment it. But due to ' ~logistical problems" involved 
in "administering such a program, explains Richard 
W arch, Associate Professor of American Studies 
and one author of the idea, "it never new." 

The more flexible curriculum of the summer 
term, however, offers new possibilities for in-
creased attention to student writing. A "Special 
Committee on Writing for the Summer Term,'' 
cbaired by professor of history Jack Hexter, was 
formed to act as a ''clearing house'' for ideas on how 
best to incorporate emphasis on writing in summer 
term courses. "The purpose of our work is not to 
tell professors how to teach writing, "says W arch, a 
member of the committee. Nevertheless, the Speci-
al Committee will soon issue to the summer term 
faculty a memorandum offering three possibilities. 

For summer term courses that emphasize writ-
ing, the Special Committee will allocate funds to 
add more graduate students to the teaching staff, 
and thus permit closer attention to students. A 
group of experienced editors will be assembled to 
screen student papers for grammatical and stylis-
tic problems before the papers are handed in to the 
course professors. In courses which do not empha-
size writing, a third option will allow students, with 
the approval of their instructors, to work individu-
ally with an editor to remedy writing problems. 

W arch and Jonathan Fanton, the Executive 
Director of the Summer Term, emphasize that 
these ideas, which have yet to be approved, are not 
designed to increase the workload on summer term 
students. Faculty members who wish to incorpor-
ate these offerings in their courses will be advised 
to adjust course requirements accordingly. 

In response to general concern around the Uni-
Yei'Sity about the intensity of academic pressure on

Term." 
students, the Special Committee will also attempt 
to insure that papers assigned in summer courses 
will not all fall due at the same time. This effort at 
coordination of course requirements could reduce 
the end-of-term crunch on summer students. 

If these ideas are accepted by the summer 
term faculty and succeed in their purpose, says 
Fanton, they could be introduced into theY ale cur-
riculum in the fall, but only if new staff and funding 
are available. 

Implicit in the suggestions of the Special 
Committee on Writing for the Summer Term is 
the recognition of two valid-and complemen-
tary-apprO,llChes to the teaching of writing. One 
way-providing for increased individual attention 
to students-offers a teacher familiar with the 
subject area of the course, and therefore know-
ledgeable in the special requirements of writing fo 
for that discipline. The second approach, which 
calls for a group of editors with little or no famil-
iarity with the subject, utilizes a basic knowledge 
of )low to write clear, precise English. 

Several departments at Yale have been using 
the first approach for many years. In the English 
department, for example, students are taught to 
write literary criticism. In the history department, 
a junior seminar (History 91) which emphasizes 
historical prose is required of majors before they 
write a senior essay. 

Many professors at Yale prefer the first 
approach. They argue that there is more to good 
·academic writing than correct English prose. 
· "There is a danger in learning to write without 
really writing anything," explains Cooke (who en-
dorses both approaches). The student must also 
learn to use his writing skills to focus and test his 
own ideas. Translating thoughts into words is . 
essential to learning: "Clear writing," Cooke con- . 
eludes, "is the result of clarified thinking.'; 

Cooke admits that many faculty members at 
Yale believe that readers who cannot understand 
highly specialized subjects are ignorant and there-
fore not worth reaching. This attitude is typified, 
he adds, by many modem poets. Many scholars 
denounce efforts to make specialized knowledge 
accessible to wider audiences as "gopularizing." 

The second appro~ch, now gaining increased 
acceptance among the faculty, does not deny the 
validity of writing for specialized disciplines. 1 ts 
proponents insist; however, that students who can 
write clear, clean sentences v.jll not only be able·to · 
translate their thoughts into words more easily, 
but will also be better able to make themselves 
understood. At a time when knowledge is increas-
ingly specialized, when interdisciplinary ap-
proaches to research are widely valued, shouldn't 
a student also be taught to write for an audience 
wider than the faculty of this department? 

Much of the extremely complex work being 
done in highly specialized areas obviously cannot 
be understood by anyone who is not familiar with 
the field. But much of this work could be more 
readily understood by people outside the field if it 
could be expressed in clear, concis~English, strip-
ped of jargon that is often vague and unnecessary. 

True, in some cases the simplification and gen-
eralization of complex subjects to make them more 
readily understandable can distort or misrepresent 
their significance. But at Yale today the teaching of 
clear, precise writing for a ~ore general audience 
than one's colleagues is gaining increased accep-
tance. For the first time in its history, the Universi-
ty endorses courses in the craft of writing, indepen-
dent of any one discipline. 

" ... if a man can keep his eyes open, distinguish 
facts from inferences, and write good English, a 
very little knowledge of history and economics and 
elementary law wiU go a great way.'' 
Arthur Twining Hadley, President of Yale from 
1899-1921, rejecting journalism training at Yale 

"We have become a fact-minded countrv," 
says William Zinsser, Master of Branford College, 
Editor of the Yale Alumni Magazine, and teacher of 
the highly successful "Non-Fiction Workshop" 
(English83-1b). "Socialchangeishappeningso 
fast-Women's Lib, advances in science, drugs, 
Civil Rights, sex-that people are inundated with 
facts. They ask 'what does it all mean?' They are 
looking for answers. 

The quickened pace of life, prompted largely 
by television, has made readers more impatient for 
those answers. No longer so willing to read a novel, 
they read newspapers, magazines, and longer non-
fiction works. Zinsser notes that several major 
American novelists-Norman Mailer andJ ames 
Baldwin, for instance-have turned from fiction to 
non-fiction, a trend he sees as' 'no accident. N on-fic-
tion has become the predominant literary form in 
America today.'' 

In most magazines today, according to Zins-
ser, non-fiction is "whattoday'swriterswrite, 
publishers publish, and readers read." 

The newspaper reporting of Watergate (with 
Robert Woodward, '65, in the front ranks), coupled 
with the rise of writer-heroes like Mailer, Tom 
Wolfe and Hunter Thompson, has sparked ana-
tionwide interest in what Zinsse~ aptly terms "the 
romance of journalism." The chance to topple gov-
ernments and expose corruption has inspired an 
awe of the media's power and attracted unprece-
dented numbers of young people to journalism. 

Columbia University's School of Journalism re-
ports that applications are up 48 per cent since 
. 1972; Northwestern reports similar statistics. Me-
dia organizations are swamped with job seekers, 
and no longer find recruiting necessary. 

The romance of journalism is eagerly pursued 
by Yale students. When Yale'sOffi<:eofPublic In• 
formation and theNew Haven Register jointly of-
fered a journalism internship, 40 students immed-
iately responded with applications. Overflow 
crowds of students have attended panel discus-
sions sponsored by the Poynter Fellowship in Jour-
nalism (established in 19~7 by Nels_on Poynter, 
M.A. '27, publisher of the St. Petersburg Times). 

Two newspapers and four undergraduate maga-
zines are curre:t;ttly published on campus. 

In response to this increased interest, the col-
lege seminar program has in the past five years in-
cluded course titles such as "Personal Journal-
ism, "taught by Loudon Wainwright, and" Jour-
nalism, the Art of the Fact," taught by Pulitzer 
Prize winner Thomas Powers, Yale '60. The swol-
len number of applicants to these courses has been 
interpreted by some as an adjunct to grim profes-
sionalism. 

But the teaser that draws many of these 
would-be writers is the chance to read and imitate 
cult heroes, many of whom have pried their way 
into journalism, stretched its limitations, and 
created what is lPOsely called "the New Journal-
ism." Writers such as Norman Mailer, Jimmy 
Breslin. Gay Talese, Hunter Thompson and Tom 
Wolfe draw freely from the resources of fiction 
and inject much of their own personalities into 
their writing. 

Tom Wolfe, who earned a Ph.D. from Yale in 
American Studies (he wrote his dissertation on po-
litical activities of American writers of the 1930's), 
writes frequently for New York magazine and first 
reached a large "counterculture" audience with his 
book The Electric Kool-AidAcid Test. Zinsser be-
lieve that Wolfe's writing is "exhilarating, but ex-
hausting on the optic nerve.'' 

HunterS. Thompson, inventor of "Gonzo" 
journalism (his own term) and the most outrage-
ously drug-crazed writer of all, cut his teeth writ-
ing features for The National Observer as their 
South American correspondent. He has chronicled 
his more recent adventures tn HeU's Angels; A 
$trange and Terrible Saga, Fear and Loathing in 
Las Vegas, FearandLoathingon the Campaign 
Tra4 (the 1972 presidential election) and Fear and 
Loathing at the Superbowl. 

These colorful and innovative writers, and 
others like them, have exposed students to the va-
riety of forms that personal expression can take. 
The college seminars which have sprung up in 
response are flooded with applications. 

But these courses, because they deal largely with a 
subject matter that runs the risk of becoming fad-
dish, generally have a short life span at Yale. They 
usually run for the two years allowed them in the 
college seminar program and disappear when no 
place is offered them in the academic departments. 
But they do encourage students to improve their 
writing on their own, in student publications, and 
in other writing courses. 

The longest running and most successful non· 
fiction writing course. and the only such course to 
complete the move from the seminar program to 
the English department, is Zinsser' s • 'Non-Ficti~n 
Workshop."


Zinsser brought the teaching of non-fiction 
writing-which he broadly defines as writing for 
publication in magazines and professional jour-
nals-toY ale as a Calhoun College seminar in the 
spring of 1971. It was absorbed into the English 
department in 1973. Because of continuing student 
demand, the English department offered a similar 
course last fall and this spring taught by Charles 
Elliott,aformercopyeditoratLIFEandnowa 
senior editor at Alfred Knopf &Company. 

Zinsser came toY ale almost by accident. A 
veteran of the now-defunct New York Herald Trib-
une. he had been a successful freelance writer in 
NewYorkandbeenaregularcolumnistforLIFE 
magazineforfiveyears.Butthesolitudeof 
sitting before a typewriter in his New York 
City apartment began to get to him so he tried 
tofindateachingjob.Atasummersession 
atlndiana University he found teaching to be 
"exhilarating," so he began to search for a 
JM>.rmanentjobatanexperimentalcollege. 

Much tQ his surprise, Yale called Zinsser. 
R. W.B. Lewis, then Master of Calhoun, invited 
him to teach a college seminar. Zinsser was eager 
to leaveN ew York, so he accepted. Soon after he 
had bought a house in New Haven, Zinsser received 
another call. The Yale Alumni Magazine needed an 
editor-was he interested? Though it seemed "an 
absurd thing for a middle-aged man from Prince-
ton to do," he accepted that, too. Threeyearslater, 
he accepted yet another Yale position -as Master 
of Branford College. 

Zinsser first taught his "Non-Fiction Work-
shop" in the spring of 1971. Teaching from his own 
experience, he hoped to exPOse his students to the 
llUlll¥ options OJ?eD to them as writers of non-fie· 
tion.Hesuggestedreadingsfromavarietyofnon-
fiction writers, and read excerpts in class from 
others. His students wrote one paper each week in 
a different area of non-fiction-the interview, the 
editorial, science writing, personal experience, 
feature writing. 

Above all, Zinsser emphasized craft. "Writ-
ing is a craft, like carpentry," he believes. He 
ruthlessly red-penciled clutter and jargon from his 
students' papers. He stressed organization, 
meaningful detail, and always, clarity. 

Fom the beginning, Zinsser knew what his 
course was not. It was not creative writing. It was 
not a course in journalism; he hoped to help stu-
dents with a wide range of interests, both academic 
and professional, to communicate their knowledge 
clearly. Today, he is careful to admit some' 'maver-
icks" to the course each year-students who have 
never written for publication. And he does not 
allow group criticism of student writing, each 
student receives his individual attention. 

Finally, the Workshop was not intended as a 
"career preparation" course. Although many of his 
students hope to write as a career (graduates of the 
course today work with a number of newspapers 
and magazines), Zinsser stresses that the best col-
lege preparation for writing is a strong liberal arts 
program, and the best post-graduate training is 
found on small newspapers and magazines. The 
"Non· Fiction Workshop" has been such a success 
at Yale that Zinsser has now written the basic prin-
ciples of his teaching into a book, to be published 
by Harper & Row as both a textbook and a gen-
eral interest work. 

As Yale seeks to raise the quality of student 
writing, it should consider the basic philosophy of 
writing that Zinsser teaches in his course. Stu-
dents who can write clearly for a general audience 
can also write clearly for their professors. Much of 
the jargon and imprecision which clouds student 
writing can and should be eliminated. Most of the 
lengthy papers cranked out in the wee hours of the 
morning could be condensed. A short, concise es-
say cannot be padded with lengthy quotes. If stu-
dents were encouraged to get to the point without 
concern for page length requirements, maybe they 
would not resort to the widespread practices of 
paddi.ng, cheating on margins, using typewriters 
with large typefaces, and even submitting other 
students' papers with a new tiUe page . . 

Richard W arch of the Special Committee on 
Writing for the Summer Term agrees that "a short 
paper written twice is probably better than a longer 
paper written once," especially in terms of writing 
quality. 

In a few years, the success of the University's 
efforts should be known. Maybe then Y aJe stu-
dents will ~ good writers. 0

The Latest Final Policy 
by Carol Eliel and Mindy Beck 
Yale's policy towards freedom of 
expression has, it seems, come full 
circle. Or perhaps it never changed at 
all. Or perhaps-most importantly-
Yale has no coherent policy firmly 
and clearly stated. All of these points 
of view have been expressed in re· 
action to the recent release of the 
Report of the Committee on Freedom 
of Expression at Yale, known also as 
theW oodward Report. 

Over the past 12 years, President 
Brewster has often expressed the 
University's belief in "the encourage· 
ment of controversy, no matter how 
fundamental, and the protection of 
dissent, no matter how extreme." 
Furthermore, Brewster has also said 
that "willful disruption of the activ-
ity of the University cannot be toler· 
a ted. The right to recommend sus· 
pension or dismissal of anyone who 
disrupts the life of the University 
must be understood." 

Yetjustlastmonth the University 
saw fit to issue anew a statement of 
policy concerning freedom of ex pres· 
sion. On January 8, 1975 the admin-
istration distributed copies of the 
of Expression at Yale, the fmalstate-
ment of a 13-member committee 
chaired by Sterling Professor of 
History C. Vann Woodward. 

· In essence, this report reiterates 
the assumptions previopsly laid out 
by President Brewster. It states the 
"need for Yale to reaffirm a commit· 
ment to the principle of freedom of 
·expression and its superior impor· 
tance to other laudable principles and 
values, to the duty of all members of 
the University community to defend 
the right to speak and refrain from 
disruptive interference, and to the 
sanctions that should be imposed 
upon those who offend." The report 
suggests ten ways of achieving these 
ends, including an explicit statement 
of University policy, firm administra· 
tive action when freedom of ex pres· 
sion is denied anyone, and possible 
suspension or expulsion as punish· 
ment for disrupters. 

Why did Yale re-state policy when 
previous statements were clear? The 
answer lies in the administration's 
past reluctance to carry out its own 
policy. 

In 1963, the Political Union's 
executive board rescinded a speaking 
invitation to Governor George Wal-
lace of Alabama under what appears 
to have been heavy pressure from the 
Yale administration. In 1969, as mili-
tarism flared on campuses across the 
nation, students seized Wright Hall, 
and held University personnel cap· 
tive for several hours. Forty-seven 
students were suspended as a result, 
but were immediately reinstated, be-
cause "it was felt that the suspension 
was a sanction," according to Georges 
May, Dean ofY ale College at the 
time. Several times in the past ten 
years protestors have disrupted 
classes or film showings for a variety 
of reasons. The administration has 
never taken any serious or long-term 
disciplinary action. During April and 
May of 1970, at the time of the Black 
Panther murder trial in New Haven-
and the planned May Day demon· 
strations-freedom of expression was 
maintained at Yale in spite of high 
tension. But two years later, in April, 
1972, a hostile crowd shouting anti· 
war slogans and obscenities effective· 
ly prevented General William West· 
moreland, another P. U. speaker, from 
reaching the podium. No disciplinary 
action ensued. Shortly thereafter, 
Secretary of State William Rogers 
cancelled an appearance to receive a 
P. U. award, claiming "pressing 
engagements'' elsewhere. 

The Shockley affair last spring was 
thus only the last in along line of 
events at Yale bringing to the fore-
front the University's policy-or lack 
thereof-on freedom of expression. 

As unclear as it had been in the past, 
administration PQlicy was even 
vaguer in the spring of 1974. Shock· 
ley himself called the episode "the 
administratively worst-handled dis-
ruption I've experienced." The appar-
entlack of standard procedures led 
Brewster to establish a committee 
• 'to examine the condition of free 
. expression, peaceful dissent, mutual 
r:_;spectand tolerance at Yale, (and) to 
draft recommendations for any 
measures it may deem necessary for 
the maintenance of those principles." 

Early this year the committee pub· 
lished its final statement. 

Included in the booklet with the 
committee's report is a statement by 
· the one dissenting member of the 
committee, Kenneth J. Barnes, a 
graduate student in both law and 
economics. "Specific limitations of 
tolerance are justifiable," Barnes 
• writes, "if they further the pursuit of 
• truth." In addition, he claims that the 
powerful have more influence in con-
trolling the "free marketplace of 
• ideas" than minority groups do, and 
thus "can.dominate the market and 
drive out weaker, albeit 'true' ideas." 
Free expression in the short run does 
not always outweigh potential long-
run costs, Barnes says, thereby dis· 
agreeing with the majority's view, 
"that the results of free expression 
are to the general benefit in the long 
run, however unpleasant they may 
appear at the time." 

Reacti<_>n to the rep<?rt has been 
_._,.. · mixed. President Brewster issued 
only a short statement in response to 
theW oodward Report. He praised 
·"the Committee's insistent desire to 
st~1_1gtheJ?. the protection of freedom 
of expression at Yale," although he 
disagreed. with the recommendation 
that University offieials should 
a ttempt to dissuade a group from 
issuing a particular invitation. Brew· 
ster also suggested that "suspension 
for not less than a year ... be auto-
matic" for those found to have dis-
rupted a University event. 

Stanley Flink, Yale's Director of 
Public Information, stressed that the 
Woodward Committee's report was 
only a recommendation, and not yet 
University policy. The Yale Corpor· 
ation, which ultimately is the body to 
set policy, began consideration of the 
matter on February 8, and may not 
make any decisions until the next 
Corporation meeting. Flink did say, 
however, that a clear policy on free· 
dom of expression at Yale will be laid 
down within the next few months, 
adding that "the maximum freedom 
of expression is still th~ principle and 
always has been." He called the 
present time an "interim moment," a 
point at which the University has no 
official policy. As far as press cover· 
age of campus events is concerned, he 
said that for the present "there is no 
policy but common sense." He would 
not comment further on the report 
and added that President Brewster's 
statement was also final. 

Professor C. V ann Woodward, 
chairman of the committee which 
authored the report, was "very satis-
fied with (it)," and added, " ) very 
much appreciated (Brewster's) sup-
port, especially the last line of his 
letter," which emphasized that dis· 
ruption of a University event is not 
tolerable. W ood.ward feels that the 
Corporation may alter or add to the 
report before establishing it as Uni· 
versity policy, but claimed that in 
any form such a policy would affect 
campus activities. "I believe," he 
said, "that it will encourage a new 
spirit about the principle of free 
speech." In general he found support 
of free speech • 'pretty widespread in 
the University," calling the opinion 
promulgated by the dissenting state· 
mentone of a "non-representative 
minority." He continued, "I find it 
ironic that this opposition to free 
speech is largely radical and this 
movement which started out in 
Berkeley in 1964 as the Free Speech 
Movement has turned out in its latter 
days to be against free speech." 

Thomas Spahn, former Executive 
Director of Lux et Veritas, one of the 
campus groups which considered in-
viting Shockley last year, com-
mented, "I always assumed that the 
University believed in the freedom of 
speech ... The committee just re-stated 
the obvious." lr. 3hort, he was "very, 
very plea:::ed" wich the committee's 
statement. Spahn was disappointed 
with the U Diversity's vague policy on 
television coverage of Yale events, 
but added that the committee no 
doubt had been unable to study such 
problems due to lack of time. He did 
not feel that the report would affect 
Lux et Veritas, a conservative group 
engendered by the radical activities 
on May Day 1970. "We wanted to 
bring in a variety of viewpoints to 
campus that aren't normally heard, 
and we'll keep on doing that," said 
Spahn. (In January, Lu.xet Veritas 
published.a detailed history on free 
speech at Yale during the sixties and 
seventies, and included its own 
views). Greg Hyatt, the current Exec-
utive Director of Lux et V eritas, also 
feels that "it was a pretty good re-
port ... It comes down hard for free 
speech and against disruption, which 

is the proper attitude as far as I'm 
concerned." Hyatt said that he didn't 
like the dissenting report, but added 
that he felt the majority report looked 
even better in light of it. 

Eugene Meyer, the President of the 
Young Americans for Freedom at 
Yale, the group that finally sponsored 
the Shockley debate, feels similarly 
about the committee's report. "Basi-
cally I was pretty pleased with it," he 
said. It seemed to stress the need for 
freedom of speech or some kind of 
freedom of expression." He did not 
think that the report would alter 
significantly theY .A.F. 's invitation 
policy. Meyer stated that he personal-
ly felt that before inviting a speaker 
theY .A.F. should consider whether 
or not the meeting would be valuable 
to the participants, not whether or 
not it would be disrupted. Nor was he 
altogether confident of the report's 
future success as University policy. 
"I don't think, given Yale's record on 
freedom of speech, that feeling secure 
would be terribly rational," he said. 
But I feel that the chances by and 
large are a lot better than they would 
have been without that report ... It 
remains to be seen what will happen." 

But there are others who disagree 
with the report's findings, and who 
claim that their opinion is being ig-
nored. Elwyn Lee, former Chairman 
of the Black Law Students Union, 
insisted "Ken Barnes is absolutely 
right when he says that very little 
attention is being paid to his dis-
sent ... It's ironic." Lee was originally 
upset over the composition of the 
committee, because he felt it was 
designed to vindicate an as yet un-
announced, presumed consensus 
about free speech, "a mythical con-
sensus which wasn't defined." Lee 
believes that any University official, 
in accord with his right to free speech, 
should be allowed to speak out on the 
propriety of an invitation to anyone 
to appear at Yale; he believes that the 
report heads in the right direction on 
this matter although "the committee 
members don't go as far as (Lee) 
would like." 

Lee's biggest criticism of the 
Woodward Report involves the sec-
tion entitled' 'Of Ways and Means." 
He claimed that the report allows for 
peaceful registration of opposition 
but nothing more. Thus, Lee said, the 
fact that •• (the committee members) 
don't want anybody hurt" is placed 
above their belief in freedom of ex-
pression. In addition, he said that the 
report focuses too heavily on the dis-
ruption of speeches and ignores other 
violations of the freedom of expres-
sion. Lee criticized Brewster's desire 
for standard punishment of disrup-
ters, claiming that hidden that desire 
was a feeling that the President "does 
not trust the faculty," ... and that he 
was disappointed by what the exec-
utive committee did to those students 
brought before it after the Shockley 
affair. Lee feels that Brewster's lack 
of trust contradicts the "supposed 
consensus on free speech'' that some 
claim exists. In general, Lee com-
plained that the committee did not do 
much thinking, because "they knew 
what they were going to say in ad-
vance." 

Michael Darnell, present Chairman 
criticized theW oodward Report as 
being simplistic. "To call for an ab-
solute rule on this campus is to ignore 
restraints on freedom of expression in 
the greater society," he said, citing 
such examples as the practical joker 
who yells "fire" in a crowded theatre 
or the old man who displays himself 
to young girls on the street. Accord-
ing to Darnell, "The Woodward Com-
mittee Report would throw dis-
cretion, reason, morality, and many 
of the other values we ... cherish off the 
campus or subordinate them ... to an 
'absolutism' that denies man's ability 
to solve problems." He focused on the 
Shockley affair, decrying the use of 
the "absolutism" which he thinks the 
Woodward Report advocates as a 
''free ticket to those racists who 
abound (at Yale) to inflict irreparable 
harm upon minorities under the guise 
of scholarship.'' Darnell argued that 
"'absolutism' does not justify the 
relegating of morality to third class 
status among values." In addition, he 
faulted the report on the grounds that 
the committee was predominantly 
white, and that the final statement 
was written largely by four of the 
thirteen committee members and 
based on preconceived notions. 

Three letterw signed by a total of 
4 7 members of theY ale faculty also 
registered disapproval of theW ood-
ward Report and of President Brew-
ster's recommendations. The short-
est letter, from three faculty mem-
bers, said, ''There are circumstances 
and situations in which 'free expres-
sion' can inflict a violence which, 
though less obvious than physical 
force, is perhaps no less severe ... We ... 
urge the Corporation to take account 
of the' non-physical forms which 
violence can assume, and to refrain 
from taking too facile a stand on the 
questions of disruptions." The eleven 
signers of a second letter wrote, 
" ... We understand that individuals 
may at times feel bound in conscience 
to oppose (a) speech.'' They added, 
"We do not believe that it is possible 
to assign primary importance to one 
value unconditionally, be it freedom 
of expression or any other value,'' 
thus attacking the basic premise of 
theW oodward Report. The third let-
ter, signed by 44 professors, urged 
that "on both moral and pragmatic 
grounds ... the University ... retain the 
possibility of a mild or suspended 
sentence in a case of interference with 
free speech.'' They claimed that 
denial of discretion in sentencing was 
an abdication of "the moral responsi-
bility of judgment." They said also 
that the ability of severe sanctions to 
deter further disruptions was at best 
doubtful. The 44 professors claimed 
that mild rather than severe sanc-
tions would often be appropriate "in 
light of adequate mitigating circum-
stances." 

Does Yale have a coherent policy 
on the freedom of expression? T«h-
nically speaking, not yet. Yet almost 
everyone is treating the Woodward 
Report as if-with minor additions or 
alterations-it were already policy. 
And reaction to the report is spread-
ing outside of theY ale community. 
InarecentarticleintheNew York 
Times, Anthony Lewis wrote, "Other 
Universities will look to the Wood-
ward Report for a philosophical ex-
position of the classical argument for 
freedom.'' The report is making far-
reaching ripples in the academic 
pond.O

The Experience of Directing 
byJemWiner 
Nikos Constantin A thansios Psach-
aropoulos VII has taught acting and 
directing at Yale for almost twenty 
years. For eighteen of those years he 
has.also beenExecutiveDirectorof 
the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 
Massachusetts, considered by many 
critics to be the finest summer theatre 
in the country. 

· Emmy winner Dick Cavett and 
Obie winners Sam Waterston and 
Stacy Keach began their careers 
under Nikos at Yale. So did actor/ 
director Austin Pendleton (who won 
an Qbie for "The Last Sweet Days of 
Isaac" and appeared in "Catch 22," 
and "What's Up, Doc?") and Long 
Wharf Director Arvin Brown. Geral-
dine Fitzgerald, Lee Grant, E. G. 
Marshall, Mildred Dunnock, Thorn-
ton Wilder and dozens of others have 
acted in his productions at Williams-
town. 

Last summer, Nikos directed his 
61 st production at Williamstown, 
Chekov 's 'The Seagull. " The cast 
included Lee Grant, Blythe Danner, 
Kevin McCarthy, andFrankLan-
gella. The National Educational Tele-
vision Network asked him to film the 
production for their Theatre in Amer-
ica series. Nikos accepted, and re-
solved to do all editing himself. Five 
and a half days of shooting, three 
hundred thousand dollars, three 
months of editing, and many Nikos 
man-hours later, "The Seagull" 
appeared on national television to 
considerable acclaim. Reviewers 
called it "a natural, energetic Chek-
ov, "and "the most complete Chekov 
imaginable. "The only sour notes 
came from aN. Y. Times reviewer, 
who didn't like the background 
music, composed by Arthur Ruben-
stein ("not the famous one, " says 
Nikos). 

We talked to Nikos about the ex-
perience of filming the work. We 
caught him on the run, between class, 
and a screening of "The Seagull" for 
his Yale students at the Art and 
Architecture Building. He talked 
about the problems of directing 
Chekov, teaching, working with 
actors, and making theatre into tele-
vision. 

NJ: How did your first t .v. produc-
tion come about? 
Nikos: "The Seagull" is not my 
first televised play, it's just the first 
in which I supervised the photo-
graphy and also the editing. First, 
N .E. T . asked me to do it, I asked the 
cast, and finally we did it. It was a 
good choice for me, because Chekov 
adapts himself to the t.v. screen well; 
he never writes about something or 
_someone you can't see. You just need 
an exterior and an interior set. Can 
you imagine " Our Town" on t .v.? It 
wouldn't work. With "The Seagull" I 
didn't have to keep it a play or make it 
a movie but could just make it be 
Chekovon t.v. 

NJ: Have you been happy with the 
result? How have your reviews been? 
Nikos: The East coast reviewers 
liked it, but the three Los Angeles 
papers flipped over it. They say that 
Chekov is all of a sudden a household 
word. That's great. 

NJ: Howdidyougoaboutcasting 
it? 
Nikos: I cast the people I like, and 
I cast them for the Williamstown 
stage, not for t.v. Emotional range is 
primary, since they're all profession-
als, you assume the vocal and physi-
cal range. 

NJ: How was the actual stage per-
formance? 
Nikos: There were some problems. 
We only rehearsed about two weeks 
and four days. It's never enough 
though people exaggerate how much 
time you need. Lee Grant had diffi-
culties getting an idea of her aura, the 
characterization of Arkadina in Mos-
cow. There were also a lot of battles. 
Lee had thought she was going to 
relax, enjoy a vacation and her art, 
and then 37 reviewers came up and 
criticized her performance. There-
views were mostly bad and that put 
pressure on. She was frightened by all 
of the publicity. 

NJ: Did the film version change. 
any of the performances? 
Nikos: Lee was better on t .v. than 
she was on stage where she was too 
undisciplined. All the others were 
more or less the same. 

NJ: Were there any difficulties in 
the actual filming? 
Nikos: We only had five and a half 
days. Trying to coordinate color when 
you're shooting day and night is al-
most impossible. I also knew I had to 
shrink the performance for t.v. True 
adaptation to the medium changes 
what you're doing, although I didn't 
re-direct any of the scenes. We filmed 
it on location at Williamstown, bor-
rowing a Williams College professor's 
house. All we had to do to it was 
change the shutters. We brought up 
the furniture we needed from New 
York. 

NJ: Five and a half days sounds 
like a very short time. 
Nikos: The last day we worked 
twenty-five hours straight. At least 
the last three hours were pure hell. 
Cameras take four hours to set up 
sometimes, then the actors get up and 
act for maybe five or ten minutes. 
Then they have to move the cameras 
again. But the crew was excellent. 
The man who did the audio has won 
four academy awards. Most of our 
lighting problems were taken care of 
later, in the studio. We ended up re-
lighting the entire play and added 
special effects. For example, when I 
had a close-up of Blythe (Danner, who 
played Nina, a young country girl 
aspiring to be an actress), we colored 
the film just a shade pink. 

NJ: Did you re-shoot many scenes? 
Nikos: WeshotonelineofBlythe's 
fourteen times to get the right effect. 
But Act IV was done in one take. We 
used three cameras most of the time. 
. Usually, whenyou'reselectingshots 
from the truck, a red light goes on in 
the camera that is filming. So the 
actor ends up knowing which of the 
three cameras is taking his picture. I 
asked the camera men, "Is there any 
way that they won't know?" They · 
said, • 'Yes, if you put the cameras in 
isolation." Which we did, leaving me 
to work on it later, taking the time in 
the editing room. It's not the best 
way. 

NJ:Why? 
Nikos: It drives you bananas. 
Especially with tape. I dicllearn a lot 
about the medium, when to use close-
~ps. I also got involved with the 
rhythm of editing: is this a group 
shot, or a person, or whatever. I en-
joyed cutting back and forth. But the 
real work was done with the actors. 
The t.v. work was mostly technical. 

NJ: Were you unhappy with any of 
the performances? 
Nikos: I could not do what I want-

ed with Trigorin, so often I would cut 
back to Nina. I tried to get Trigorin to 
have more urgency on the camera. 
The play could have been his. But his 
characterization was bland, too 
mushy. He had done it before and 
never moved away from his earlier 
performance. 
NJ: How does one go about becom-
ing a director these days? 
Nikos: You train. You must go into 
a program in one of the few schools 
there are, unless you're an actor and 
switch later on. 
NJ: Howdidyou begin? 
Nikos: I went to school at Oberlin 
and then Yale. 
NJ: How do you go about directing 
a play? 
Nikos: First I read it, then I put it 
away for a while. I think about it, let 
it happen to me in my mind. Then I . 
form my ideas, backing them up with 
evidence, other things that are hap-
pening. 
NJ: Do you tell your actors how 
you want to do a play? 
Nikos: I just let them act. I don't 
say anything until they say some-
thing. It's much better to let the 
actors develop. You guide them, it's 
anthologizing, putting them into the 
right direction. 
NJ: Have you ever directed a disas-
ter? 
Nikos: I did a very bad version of 
"Lion in Winter." Wedidn'thititoff, 
it wasn't the right chemistry. I didn't 
have the right cast, and they didn't 
have the right director. What can you 
do? Afterit'sover,youjustsay, 
"back to the drawing board." 
NJ:Whatabouttheeconomicsof 
the theatre? Are the stories about the 
starving actors still true? 
Nikos: Yes. Starving actors are a 
fact of life because it's too easy to be-
come an actor, much too easy. If it 
were more difficult, there would be 
less of them, and if there were less of 
them, there would be less unem-
ployed. 
NJ: Alvin Epstein (director of 
many Yale Rep productions) was 
interviewed in the Yale Alumni 
Magazine a few years ago claiming 
there were too many amateurs in 
theatre. 
Nikos: He was right, there are too 
many, but who in hell is going to de-
cide who is an amateur? Still, you 
don't want a veterinarian to do heart 
surgery, do you? Then why do you 
allow untrained people to direct and 
act? I realize people believe it's in-
stinctual, butitisalsoascience. I 
trained for years, everyone should. 
There are a million amateurs who see 
themselves as professionals. 
NJ: Haveyoueverworkedin the 
commercial theatre? 
Nikos: Some of the things I have 
done have made money. What's the 
difference between the two? I don't 
think that everything done for art's 
sake is art, or that everything meant 
to be commercial is bad. Still, Amer-
ica is far behind where it should be. In 
Russia, the artists are paid as much 
as the Generals. Or so they tell me. 
I'm sorry we're not subsidized for 
theatre here. I envy people in Eng-
land and Canada. We don't have the 
money to do what we want. 
NJ: Whataboutresidentialcom-
panies? 
Nikos: I think the residential com-
panies are the salvation of the 
theatre. It's where people can do their 
best work. 
NJ: Have you seen any produc-
tions you have especially liked or dis-
liked in the past few years? 
Nikos: I really loved Oliver's 
"Uncle Vanya" in England last year. 
It was beautiful. It found what was 
contemporary in the material. And 
also Peter Brooke's "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," which was most 
inventive. The worst thing modem 
directors do is impose things on 
material when there's so much al-
ready there. To invent, before you 
take the time to discover, is danger-
ous. Youdon't mixupchemicalin-
gredients unless you first identify 
them and discover them. 
NJ: Is teaching important to you? 
Nikos: Obviously. It's more than 
half of my career, not in terms of time, 
but in terms of interest. At Williams-
town, we get in as many young people 
as possible at our school. They feed 
into our second company, and that 
feeds into our main one. 
NJ: Howmanyshowshaveyou 
done in your career? 
Nikos: I don'tkeep track, but more 
than a hundred. Now I try not to 
direct more than two or three plays a 
year, in order to continue to replenish 
my thoughts in between. 0

(continued from page 2) 
"How about tomorrow morning?" I 
asked. "Some other time, I'm a-
fraid." 
Clutching Erica Jong, I took the 
next elevator up to the library. It re-
minded me of L & B, deep shiny 
worn-leather chairs, arched windows, 
the ease and stuffiness of an English-
man's study. Several retired types 
slept in assorted positions in arm-
chairs. I remembered that L & B 
used to be closed to women, and got 
bolder. 
I tried to figure out the classifica-
tion system. One section for bio-
graphy, another for history, I wan-
dered from shelf to shelf. My eye fell 
on the row labeled "Women." The 
first book was The Dangerous Sex, 
by H. R. Hays. Then there was Life 
with Women and How to Survive it, 
A Guide, with such helpful hints as 
how to explain a football game to 
your wife. 
Perhaps Helen Gurlie Brown's Sex 
and the Single Girl was more my 
line. Then there was Esquire's All 
About Women. Women Today, now 
that might prove useful, "A Source-
book." It was published, alas, in 
1938. 
I had expected these titles, rem-
nants of the old blue, no-pants days. 
But the tokens of the times surprised 
me. Here was The Second Sex, The 
Feminine Mystique, The Female 
Eunuch, even Sexual Politics, all in 
hefty hardback. I was feeling the old 
schizophrenia. A quick check showed 
The Feminine Mystique had been 
borrowed exactly three times since 
1966. Still, a beginning. For histori-
cal perspective, there was Everyone 
was Brave, about the suffrage move-
ment, no complaints there, and even, 
wonder of wonders, that radical 
socialist feminist Charlotte Perkins 
Gilman's Woman and Labor, posi- . 
tively communistic. The book selec-
tion committee must have thought it 
was about pregnancy. 
There were a few other titles I 
didn't recognize, though The Bold 
Women sounded promising. About 
hookers? And then my favorite, John 
Stuart Mill's classic On the Subjec-
tion of Women. I knew it well. An 
eminent professor had once told me 
that you had to watch out for his 
conclusions because he had been liv-
ing in sin with that woman Harriet. 
What two books were the most 
dog-eared, tattered and stained with 
the largest number of purple date 
stamps? You guessed it-Andrew 
Sinclair's The Better Half, and Ash-
ley Montague's The Natural Superi-
ority of Women. 
Before I discovered any other Yale 
Club secrets, or got thrown out, I 
hoisted my totebag, a few sheets of 
engraved notepaper, and a copy of 
Penthouse Magazine left open on the 
ta!>le. I stole it as a political act, re-
membering the pants dropped in the 
elevator. O

**Thoughts on a National Police Academy**
**Author: Edward F. Droge, Jr.**

Thoughts on a National Police 
Academy 
Two and one half years ago the 
Knapp Commission asserted, in no 
uncertain terms, that corruption was 
widespread in the New York City 
Police Department. Since then, other 
major cities have taken to task the 
investigation of their own police de-
partments. The results of those in-
vestigations have flowed in a steady 
stream before the public in the form 
of sordid front-page stories. One city 
recently in the news was Phila-
delphia. Corruption in its police 
department, said the Pennsylvania 
Crime Commission, was "ongoing, 
widespread, systematic and occur-
ring at all levels." Moreover, the 
commission accused the mayor of 
attempting to block the investiga-
tion. In the interim between the 
Knapp Commission Report and the 
Pennsylvania Crime Commission 
Report, a spate of police depart-
. ments bit the bullet while bearing up 
to degrading allegations concerning 
the ethical performance of their men: 
Detroit, Baltimore, Newark, Cleve-
land, Chicago, Albany, Minneapolis, 
Atlantic City, Paterson, Indiana-
polis-the list grows longer every 
month. 
Shocking? Apparently not. It 
seems that ugly revelations of this 
nature about the police of numerous 
cities are not enough to spur the 
country into taking measures to 
treat the problem effectively. Per-
haps it is because the people already 
know that their high school educated 
policemen are not really the "finest." 
Perhaps the media headlines are old 
news to most people who know from 
their own experience the extent to 
which the corruption exists. Perhaps 
the public expects no more from its 
police. Perhaps every major city in 
the country will have to rumble with 
police department scandals before 
there is an impetus for action. But 
one thing is certain: everyone, in-
cluding the majority of this coun-
try's policemen, would rather have 
corruption-free departments, yet 
little is being done to achieve that 
end. True, there are many energetic 
individuals and organizations, such 
as the Police Foundation and the 
staff working under the Law En-
forcement Assistance Act, striving 
to better our police. But when viewed 
with a national perspective, the 
effort is relatively minimal, par-
ticularly when it is becoming in-
creasingly clear that most-if not 
all-major cities suffer corruption to 
some degree. 
The problem is not so easily 
solved. It is not as simple as a few 
rotten applies in the barrel. An entire 
system-a tradition-must be 
broken. 
The time has come for a National 
Police Academy, or at least a study 
of the National Police Academy con-
cept. The idea is not that complex. 
A national institution with a curri-
culum aimed at producing profes-
sional police officers could be set up 
similar to the military academies. 
Earnest, career-minded individuals 
would be recruited and awarded not 
only a college-level degree, but also 
officer rank, in return for an obliga-
tion to serve in a specified police de-
partment for a certain number of 
years following graduation. While it 
may be a good idea to provide the 
stipulation that a graduate be per-
mitted to serve in various cities 
during his career, by no means would 
this institution be an invitation to 
nationalize our police force. High 
standards would be set for the 
Academy a.nd maintained at a level 
commensurate with the desired re-
sult-a truly professional graduate 
who can not only cope face-to-face 
with corruption, but who can also 
help in overcoming the system that 
actively plagues our police depart-
ments. 
In the police departments of most 
major cities today a candidate needs 
only a high school diploma or its 
equivalent to satisfy the educational 
prerequisites for the job. When an in-
dividual is accepted he is given four 
to six months training, which is 
intended to cover the entire spec-
trum of police duties and assign-
ments. This includes little or no 
corruption training. Four to six 
months of training and that's it-
instant police officer. It cannot be 
too surprising, therefore, that the 
people living in corruption-ridden 
cities expect no more from their 
police, considering the educational 
standards and extent of training. 
The all-important role a police officer 
plays in our society demands a better 
educated, better trained individual 
for the position. 
In a National Police Academy, a 
single course on corruption might 
last four to six months. The graduate 
would be college educated. He would 
be looked upon as nothing less than a 
true professional and his peers would 
expect nothing less than professional 
performance at all times. The pres-
sure would be on those officers who 
chose not to conform to the image. 
The creation of a National Police 
academy-for the purpose of com-
batting police corruption-is becom-
ing more and more necessary and 
compelling with each passing day, 
with each passing newspaper splash, 
with each passing city losing con-
fidence in its men in blue. 0

**Depression Chic**
**Author: Jon Etra**

Depression chic 
My bank collapsed. The fastest loan 
in town. One point eight billion dol-
lars. Ninety branches throughout the 
New York metropolitan area. When 
the need is financial-Security Na-
tional-KABOOM-the reaction is 
Chemical-SHAZAAM! 
(My bank had collapsed.) 
Fiduciary waters run deep. These 
were the people who gave me a ticket 
to the World's Fair in '64 when I 
opened my first account and added 
page 15 
an avocado enamel percolator in '73 
when I joined Christmas Club. I 
b..9ught stamps in their postage 
machine, made copies on their xerox, 
watched their philodendrons grow 
from sturdy sprouts to spindly 
fronds. This was no idle mercenary 
cartel. This was my bank. My bank. 
Initially I belonged to the Royal 
National of New York and some 
years back, it was absorbed by 
Security. Now, Security struck me at 
the time as lacking something of the 
imperial fillip of the Royal National. 
Security was, as we know, a Long 
Island bank, which is to say not real-
ly a bank at all but more likely a sort 
of grange (or combine) or modified 
alfalfa fund which one would never 
think of as actually dealing in real, 
live, legitimate, tinkling money (one 
could see the bushels of apples and 
corn strewn hither thither about the 
rude wood-beamed arches of its 
vaults). And yet an admirable brava-
do lingered around this metropolitan 
interloper which in the end caught 
my economic whimsy. Here was the 
proverbial David facing off the 
megalosaurian Philistines. I was 
stirred. 
Now all is gone, eviscerated, ex-
punged. What have you done to my 
bank, William Simon? Two billion 
dollars of the little guy's best blood 
sold down the river for forty million 
pieces of corporate silver-it gives 
one a lasting financial frisson even to 
consider such an unconscionable fire 
sale. What delight is my share of the 
nation's seventh largest bank com-
pared to that erstwhile acre in the 
bedrock of America's sterling 
seventy-ninth? I am now party to 
those des testable stiffs who fought 
slammin' Saul Steinberg and the 
Leasco Data boys. I am now all 
that's tedious in American sound in-
vestment, all that's boring in our 
dependable national institutions. I 
will never get a percolator again. 
There is however some compen-
sation. Economic ruin has brought 
me a rare gift: the chance to step into 
the past. For me at least those won-
derful bread line days are back. 
Think of it, shadows of 1930, my 
bank has collapsed. I am a child 
again, a disreputable scion of no less 
than Herbert Hoover: Archie Bun-
ker's dream, selling apples on the 
street, tooling off to California, soup 
kitchens and mercy missions-the 
unutterable charm of the crash. 
Admittedly I am not the first of 
this nostalgic new wave. Those won-
derful people who brought you 
Franklin National, uh, European-
American won the lead. But I am 
still of the privileged few. True, 
FDIC has protected the cash, but in 
spirit I am still beset. My clothes 
have grown shabby. I walk with a 
slouch, ration stamps in pocket, 
WP A card at hand. I am an honored 
ghost, the envy of disaffected multi-
tudes, comrade of the eternal supine. 
And what of the rest of you, will 
you be denied this heady pas de deux 
with debacle, this epopee of economic 
demise? Take heart. Have faith. 0
