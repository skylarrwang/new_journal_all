**Recordings: Bach's "The Art of Fugue"**
**Author: William M. Burstein**
**Page number(s): 15**

Recordings 
1olulnn Sebastian Bach: Die Kunst der 
Fuge (The Art of Fugue), BWV 1080. 
Orchestral realization by Marcel Bitsch 
ll1td Claude Pascal. Chamber Orchestra of 
the Saar-Karl Ristenpart, conductor. 
~onesuch HB 3013 (mono), HB 73013 
•stereo). 2-record set. 

In 1749, Bach, plagued from childhood by 
'Vea.Jt eyes, underwent an operation which 
~dered him totally blind. The Art of 
"iUe was begun during this year; and in 
17~0, when Bach died teo days after being 
ltricken by apoplexy, it remained 
~~~~finished. 

8ach-composer, performer, and 
teacher-intended The Art of Fugue to be 
1 Pl'acticai textbook for those who wished 
~become proficient at fugue-writing. 
~use it was created as a pedagogical 
-YJCe-albeit a dazzling one-and Bach 
left no indication on the manuscript as 
to instrumentation, a controversy existed 
for many years as to whethP.r the composi-
tion ought to be performed at all. 

In recent years the consensus has been 
that the piece is well worth listening to; 
and musicians of all varieties of ability 
have scored it for organ, string quartet, 
two pianos, harpsichord, and full sym-
phony orchestra. 

The present version, for chamber 
orchestra of 13 instruments, sensibly at-
tempts neither to counterfeit a genuine 
Bach orchestration nor·to "improve" the 
tersely-voiced work by scoring it for 
full-sized symphony orchestra. 

Instead, the 22 pieces which comprise 
the work are scored sparingly, with differ-
ent orchestral timbres utilized to bring out 
the different voices. The result, at times, is 
eerie--the listener should be prepared to 
hear solo bassoons; and, in the final (and 
unfinished) fugue, trombones-but it 
comes off remarkably well. The orchestra-
tion is unobtrusive, and after a while one 
is aware only of the music. For a piece as 
timeless as The Art of Fugue, which is 
hampered by the stylistic cliches of no 
period but is by turns archaic and atonally 
far out, such a deference of orchestra to 
music is ideal. 

Ristenpart conducts his excellent 
orchestra sensitively, and presents the 
music with subtlety and sophistication. 
The recording is by Club Fran~ais du 
Disque, and was made in Paris. The sound 
is clean and rich; and stereo separation, 
which in many European recordings is not 
pronounced enough for American tastes, 
is good. Four pages of notes by Jason 
Farrow are of more than incidental 
interest. 

This recording of The Art of Fugue 
is strongly recommended as an indica-
tion that "budget" records (list price for 
the set is $5.00, but it is generally avail-
able for about a dollar less) are, at their 
best, as good as any.

**Dow Chemical at Yale**
**Author: Jerry Bruck**

Dow 
On Tuesday, December 12, a recruiter 
for the Dow Chemical Company, which 
sells napalm to the US Government, will 
be interviewing career-seekers at Yale. 
Dow and the access it has been accorded 
to university recruiting facilities have 
been a target of anti-war activists across 
the country, and the company's campus 
recruitment campaign this year has not 
been a triumph of public relations. At the 
University of Wisconsin thousands of 
students disrupted Dow's visit and the 
Chancellor called in city police to disperse 
them, and even at Harvard students 
succeeded in trapping a recruiter in a 
room for seven hours. Dow executives 
are reported to be very worried about 
their image these days. 

It seems that Dow will receive a 
relatively quiet reception at Yale. The 
students for a Democratic Society will 
probably picket either Woodbridge Hall 
or the Career offices. As of a week before 
the I 2th, there were no plans to disrupt 
the interviews. SDS chairman Karl Klare 
is preparing a ten-minute slide show of 
Vietnamese children burned by napalm 
which he will screen at various places 
around the University before Dow 
arrives, and SDS is preparing a pamphlet 
describing the effects of napalm and 
Dow's role in providing it for the 
counter-insurgency effort. Howard 
Shrobe, 1968, has written the company 
inviting its recruiter to debate the various 
issues involved, but as yet he has 
received no reply. 

Assistant Dean of Yale College 
Donald Akenson, who is responsible 
for the career -advisory office, says that 
the University has yet to formulate a 
policy on recruitment, and that he will 
probably wait until Tuesday and see 
what happens.

**Letters to the Editors**
**Author: Andrew Sims and M. L. Baily Jr.**

Letters 
To the Editors: 
The reviewer of the Jefferson Airplane 
concert (November 12) typifies the novice 
word-thought freak. The first sentence of 
his review provided a simulacrum of sense; 
the rest tapered in content to nil while it 
staggered giddily in description to a help-
lessly mawkish state of pious panegyric. 

Tentatively, in the reviewer's favor, it 
could be assumed that he is a recent-and 
thereby pardonable clumsy--convert to 
the semi-euphoric interparietal gibberish 
of psychedelic impressionism. It strikes 
me as puzzling that the Journal should find 
this puerility novel or intriguing enough to 
foist it upon its readers. 

The Airplane's performance was, com-
pared with others by them and others by 
others, one of the most turned-off me-
chanical, and sarcastic displays of what a 
big name can get away with on the provin-
cial audience at Woolsey that the per-
formance should receive a review of such 
hemophiliac adulation. 

Woolsey Hall itself is ill-suited to the 
kind of sound which the Airplane pro-
duces, but there was no compensation: 
they just poured out the prerequisite num-
ber of decibels and watts to the salivating, 
analphabetic crowd which crammed the 
hall to its gilt gunwales. From a number of 
angles in the hall, it was virtually impos-
sible to hear the vocal at all, and the 
amount of unintentional (or uncalculated) 
feedback from the amplifiers did not im-
prove even the effect. (In which case, the 
reviewer's idea of Grace Slick's voice being 
ten feet tall in a thousand foot pit is 
curiously apt.) 

The so-called light show was patent 
ineptitude. It is immaterial whether 'the 
fellow going wild with colored lights' was 
moving his hand or a paper plate to get the 
effect: it remains that there was little if any 
relation to the rhythm. 

The world of the Airplane is, for there-
viewer, a mythical realm of fast color and 
big sound. Every teeny-bopper is permitted 
a similar fantasy. It is the beauty of much 
of acid rock and the other periphery of 
the movement. But the review itself does 
an unfortunate disservice to the whole 
thing by ascribing to it a kinematic per-
fection which is dependent upon such ill-
considered impressionability. The Journal 
does worse by printing the results.

Please remove my name from your 
mailing list as we are leaving New Haven. 
I do not especially regret this 
discontinuation of receiving The New 
Journal because I find the contents, 
which I have read fairly carefully for 
three issues, less a stimulating interchange 
and ftow of carefully or wittily conceived 
ideas than a torrent of thinly concealed 
left-wing polemicism.

**O'Neill's *More Stately Mansions***

else, led him to stop working and develop 
this idea into a completely new play. 

Psychologically, it is also of interest 
that the wife that Hickey kills in The 
Iceman Cometh seems very maternal, 
forgiving him all his sins and accepting 
him no matter what he does. She refuses 
to believe he won't improve much as 
Mary, in Long Day's Journey Into Night, 
refuses to believe that Edmund has more 
than a summer cold. Another connection 
between the feelings O'Neill was 
struggling with at this time of his life 
would seem to be that the killing of his 
wife inThe Iceman Cometh represents a 
displacement of the anger and rage that 
he felt towards his mother. 

At the end of The Iceman Cometh, all 
the derelicts return to their "pipe 
dreams." Many have considered this a 
tragic ending and, I suppose, many still 
do. To me, the ending conveys an 
acceptance of man's foibles and a quiet 
recognition that men must and do live 
with illusions. For O'Neill, I think this 
ending represented his coming to terms 
with his mother's illness, his mother's 
"pipe dreams." This acceptance of his 
mother's illness is, I think, poignantly 
represented in Long Day's Journey Into 
Night by the unforgettable image of Mary 
Tyrone climbing the stairs with the final 
words, "I fell in love with James Tyrone 
and was so happy for a time." 

O'Neill was at a crossroads when he 
wrote More Stately Mansions. He was 
writing a play which depicted his inner 
feelings towards his mother, feelings be 
was only able to master in the great plays 
that came after. For the reader or viewer 
of More Stately Mansions, the words and 
images of these later plays will be 
hauntingly recalled.
