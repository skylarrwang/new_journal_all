Memoirs 1925-1950 by George Kennan 
Atlantic-Little Brown, 1967. 

"We Americans," George F. Kennan 
wrote in his private diary in the spring 
of 1949, "have won great wars and 
assumed to ourselves great powers. And 
we have thus become the least free of all 
peoples." Had Kennan, then head of the 
Policy Planning Staff of the Department 
of State, made this observation directly 
to Secretary of State Dean Acheson or to 
President Truman or to the innumerable 
jo.urnalistic pundits busy celebrating the 
tnumph of American virtue, he would 
have been regarded as perverse and 
wrongheaded beyond belief. 

Was not American leadership in the 
cause of freedom the hope of the world? 
What of the success of the Truman 
Doctrine in Greece and the Marshall Plan 
in Western Europe? Did not the signing 
of the North Atlantic Treaty in 
Washington that spring prove the 
willingness of the United States to defend 
Europe against Soviet aggression? Had we 
not democratized Japan and Germany 
through enlightened military occupation? 
Was not Japan ready for a peace treaty 
and Germany for self-government? In the 
face of such achievement could any but 
a madman assert that we were the least 
free of all peoples? 

George Kennan's intellectual 
autobiography, Memoirs 1925-1950 
is fundamentally an explanation of his 
extraordinary, even shocking, but 
persuasive dissent. The book is the most 
remarkable personal account ever written 
by an American diplomat and ranks with 
the most important autobiographies by 
Americans in any field. It should be read 
simultaneously as an essay on ethics in 
international relations and as a code of 
personal conduct for diplomats; as a 
penetrating and ironic set of observations 
about peoples under totalitarian 
government; as a contribution to the 
history of important events in which the 
autho~ participated-for example, the 
esta~hshm~nt of American diplomatic 
relations wtth the Soviet Union the 
transformation of official Amerlcan 
policy toward the Soviet Union in 1946 
the formulation of the Marshall Plan the 
1 949 and 19 50 debates over NATO ~nd 
American nuclear strategy; as a series of 
character sketches of diplomats already 
famous or deserving to be better 
remembered-Charles Bohlen William 
C. B~llitt, Wilbur J. Carr, Jose~h E. 
Davtes, John Paton Davies, Averell 
Harriman, Alexander Kirk, George 
Mess~rsmith; as a moving self-study of 
the dtplomat as outsider; but above all as 
~ sustaine~ exp~a?ation of how and why, 
m Kennan s optnton, the United States 
beca":Je "the least free of all peoples." 

Here ts a more formidable attack on the 
complacent conventional view of 
American diplomacy in the Cold War 
than is likely to be found in a whole 
library of revisionist works by 
neo-Beardian economic determinists. 

Kennan sees himself as an outsider, a

detached and troubled observer of the 
thought and life of the twentieth century. 
Even the outwardly trivial episodes of his 
life emphasize his inherited partiality for 
the eighteenth century of his pioneer 
farming ancestors, and his discomfort in 
the highly organized present. He was 
admitted to a modern university 
Princeton, but as the last student to 
arrive was exiled to a remote rooming 
house on the outskirts of town. After 
trying to cope with a Christmas mail 
delivery route in the slums of Trenton 
he caught scarlet fever and missed several 
months of freshman year. He joined an 
eat!ng club and on second thought 
re~tgned to be with the pariah minority of 
Pnnceton undergraduates not invited into 
the clubs. Throughout his career in the 
Foreign Service he was forever missing 
trains, or being overlooked and left 
behind by his superiors. When after ten 
years abroad he returned to his native 
Wisconsin for a summer, he noted in his 
diary, "In the course of a one-hundred-
mile journey I was destined to encounter 
on t~e open road no single fellow-cyclist, 
no smgle pedestrian, no single horse-
drawn vehicle .... The occupants of the 
occasional machines that went whirring 
by ... obviously had no connection in 
the. social sense with the highway over 
whtch they were driving .... They were 
lost spirits, hovering for brief periods on 
another plane, where space existed 
only in time." 

Reflecting now on that experience, 
Kennan writes: "I came away from the 
summer's visit aware that I was no longer 
a part of what I had once been a part of-
no longer, infact, a part of anything at 
all. It was not just that I had left the 
world of my boyhood, although this was 
true; it was that this world had left me. 
It had left everyone else, for that matterÂ· 
but its departure had been sufficiently 
' 
gradual so that those who remained had 
be~n less aware of its passage, and had 
adJ.usted in varying degrees to the change. 
I, hke all other expatriates, simply had 
been left behind." 

Other prominent participants in recent 
American diplomacy have felt a nostalgic 
longing for an earlier age, but not for the 
same pre-industrial eighteenth century so 
dear to Kennan. Dean Acheson, for 
eumple, finds his "Radiant Morn" at the 
turn of the nineteenth century (see the 
evocat.ive first chapter of his memoir, 
Mormng and Noon) when American 
self-confidence and British imperial 
power made the world both joyous and 
predictable-at least to a patrician 
growing up in Middletown, Connecticut. 
John Foster Dulles, as another example, 
emulated the Christian fervor and sense 
of American moral supremacy 
characteristic of Woodrow Wilson's 
vision of the League of Nations. 

But Kennan's ideal society is the 
America of Jefferson, of self-reliant 
farmers who worked hard, set their own 
standards of right conduct, and did not 
meddle in the affairs of others. "They 
asked of government only that it leave 
them alone to struggle in their own way. 
When times were hard, as they often 
were, groans and lamentations went up to 
God, but never to Washington." 

The implications of these different 
ideal pasts are obvious. Acheson, 
admiring the power of Britain in her 
imperial greatness, believed that America 
had of necessity assumed Britain's place
