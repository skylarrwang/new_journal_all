Throughout this play, Edmund's 
relationship to his mother is highly 
complex and many different feelings are 
implied: love, pity, frustration, anger, 
guilt. With regard to his mother's addic-
tion, Edmund appears to be constantly 
struggling throughout the play to keep his 
mother from withdrawing. There is a 
tendency to blame his father's miserliness 
for his mother's condition, but at the 
end everyone, including Mary herself, 
seems helpless and partly responsible for 
the illness. 

Focusing on the ending specifically, 
however, a particular configuration of the 
mother-son relationship is suggested. 
Edmund learns he bas tuberculosis, a 
serious and terrifying physical illness 
which could lead to his death, and at the 
same time his mother withdraws into 
mental illness. In O'Neill's own life, we 
know that these two events were actually 
separated by several months. However, 
the artistic juxtaposition of them as 
occuring on the same day conveys a 
special psychological meaning. 

If these two events had actually 
occurred on the same day as represented, 
it is likely that Edmund would have been 
torn and distressed by certain specific 
feelings. He would have felt remorse and 
concern for his mother, fear and certainly 
an overwhelming helplessness for himself. 
Also, since no-one can really experience 
psychiatric illness in a parent with total 
compassion and objectivity, he would 
have felt intense anger and rage at her 
for having deserted him. 

Furthermore, contracting a serious 
illness like tuberculosis is often 
experienced ambivalently. The prospect 
of long hospitalization in a sanitarium, 
although it is distressful, can also 
represent a chance to escape from an 
unpleasant reality. Considering the 
painful family experience which is 
depicted throughout Long Day's Journey 
Into Night, it is likely that Edmund would 
have unconsciously or in dim 
consciousness wished for an excuse to 
escape, even an excuse as frightening and 
unpleasant as tuberculosis. Hospitals and 
sanitaria offer a caring environment and, 
unconsciously, often represent a nurturing 
mother for those whose real mothers 
have been uncaring and unnurturant. 

If Edmund would have experienced 
such feelings of rage and wished to 
escape, it is also likely that he would have 
felt intensely guilty about them. Indeed, 
he would have felt responsible for his 
mother's withdrawal in some way and 
felt that he himself drove her away from 
him further. The idea that he felt 
responsible for his mother's difficulties 
'becomes especially plausible in light of the 
fact that Edmund knew that Mary first 
became addicted to narcotics immediately 
following his birth. 

The implication of such tortured
