**Title: Draft ...**
**Author:  Jonathan Lear**

In a press conference that will be held 
this week, President Johnson is expected 
to announce a new policy on graduate 
school deferments, according to Gustau 
Arlt, president of the Council of Graduate 
Schools( COS). Arlt interprets the press 
conference as "an extremely hopeful 
sign" that the new draft law scheduled to 
go into effect will be altered. 

Under the Military Selective Service 
Act of 1967, which has not yet been 
enacted, there are no deferments for 
graduate students except in disciplines 
that the National Security Council rules 
in the national interest. Because the new 
law requires the abolition of graduate 
school deferments and that oldest eligible 
males be drafted first, the Yale Graduate 
School could lose up to 40% of its 
students next year. 

A resolution passed by the CGS 
December 2 urges the President to alter 
the planned draft system and to come to 
an early decision, so that both graduate 
students and schools can plan for next 
year. Integral in all the lobbying of 
graduate schools is John Perry Miller, 
dean of the Yale Graduate School and 
president of the Association of Graduate 
Schools (AGS), a group of 41 prestige 
schools that works within the COS. 

"Miller sat in my suite in the Statler 
Hilton until 2 a.m. and helped me write 
the resolutions," said Arlt. 

The CGS's main recommendation for 
changing the draft argues for three basic 
changes. The first is that no discipline be 
designated as more critical than any 
other, since "all fields of higher education 
are of equally critical importance to the 
continued welfare and balanced 
development of the nation." Second, it 
argues that the draft should be based on 
some form of random selection, and third 
that men be drafted at a point of natural 
transition in their education or careers. 

The recommendation makes no plea for 
general deferment of graduate students 
because "the national security transcends 
the interest of any individual or group." 

Miller, as president of the AGS, 
formulated and drafted much in these 
suggestions. 

Miller is confident the pending draft 
laws will be modified, and feels that the 
military is as anxious as he for the 
changes, since it would be forced to draft 
men considerably older than desired. 

"College graduates are too old," says 
Miller. ''They're past their prime. Now 
the military wants some old ones, but a 
good fighting officer is past his prime 
at 21." 

No one is sure bow the law will be 
changed. Both Arlt and Miller predict that 
either the President will suspend the 
institution of this new law for a year in an 
effort to bide time, or a new system of 
random selection will be established. Arlt 
discounted the possibility that there would 
be deferments for special disciplines of 
study, for "that is the law Johnson has in 
front of him, and if he wanted it, he 
would just sign it." 

How the change in the draft laws will 
affect the Yale Graduate School, Miller 
isn't sure, for there are a number of 
contingent problems that must be 
confronted, the most serious being money. 


**Title: ... Money**

With Congress cutting back the number 
of Federal fellowships by one third, the 
Yale Graduate School faces what could 
develop into a serious financial crisis. 

Ironically, the scope of the financial 
problem hinges on the type of draft 
system that is initiated. 

If most of the first and second year 
graduate students are drafted, as they 
would be under the pending law, the crisis 
would be averted, according to John 
Hoskins, director of grant and contract 
administration. The 15,000 Federal 
fellowships to graduate education that 
exist this year have been slashed to 10,000 
for next, and graduate schools face a tight 
financial pinch unless there is a drastic 
reduction in enrollment. 

"In the long run," said Dean Miller, 
"the financial problem is quite serious if 
no changes in federal funding are made 
and if a considerable portion of the 
student body is not drafted." Because of 
the cushioning effect of a Ford 
Foundation grant, there will be no 
significant financial problems at Yale next 
year. However, in years after, the problem 
becomes acute. 

Other schools, more dependent on 
Federal funds than Yale, are already 
faced with financial chaos. The University 
of Illinois is laying off faculty at midyear. 

Miller disagreed with Hoskins' claim 
that wartime spending is responsible for 
Federal cutbacks. "It is not just an 
economy move," said Miller. "There is an 
anti-education spirit in Congress. This 
will have more than a temporary effect."

**Title: Candidate**
**Author: Steven Weisman**

Just before Ronald Reagan, another 
Presidential candidate drumming up 
support for his campaign visited Yale. He 
was Harold E. Stassen, running for the 
office for the fifth time since 1948, this 
time as "the Peace Candidate" in a race 
which be sees focused today on Lyndon 
Johnson and Richard Nixon. 

After the former Minnesota governor 
addressed nearly 100 members of the 
Political Union, someone rose to ask: 
"Mr. Stassen, what are you trying to ac-
complish, aside from creating just another 
target for Mad Magazine?" 

The round-faced Stassen smiled and 
allowed the embarrassed chuckles in the 
audience to die down. "That's a good 
question," he said. Then he went on to 
use some of the phrases which could be 
found in his prepared statement to the 
press: 

"I am well aware that in pressing for 
something I feel strongly about-peace 
in the world-1 must break through a 
heavy crust of cynicism. I must climb 
over a high ridge of ridicule. I have long 
been devoted to the cause of peace. This 
is what I must do." 

"I guess Harold Stassen is a rather 
comic phenomenon," said a Political 
Union member after the candidate's 
speech. "Students want to see just what 
kind of man would do what he's doing. 
That's why most of these people showed 
up here tonight." 

Added the student politician: "Besides, 
he is campaigning on the issues, and he's 
one of the few people who does that when 
it comes to Vietnam. For all that, he's a 
damned interesting guy to listen to." 

Whenever people asked Stassen about 
his views, though, the candidate would 
answer them formally, intoning with his 
sonorous voice as he would to a camera 
and microphone. 

''This is really the first stage of my 
campaign," he explained after his speech. 
"As I see it, the young men and young 
women of America are crucial, and that 
is why I am talking to them first. They 
appreciate honesty, and their impact will 
be decisive. Richard Nixon and George 
Romney spoke at the University of 
Wisconsin and got mixed receptions. 
When I talked there last week, I got a 
standing ovation." 

The candidate continued as he kept 
signing autographs for students: "I've 
decided so far to enter the Wisconsin 
Primary, in April. I'm going out to Utah, 
and then to New York to speak to more 
students. I think I shall continue until 
January 1, when the first stage of my 
campaign ends and it comes time to speak 
to larger groups of voters." 

Stassen had outlined a plan which 
involved "quieting down the war," 
recognizing and negotiating with North 
Vietnam and Red China, retrenching to 
enclaves on the South Vietnamese coast 
until talks begin, and adding Communist 
nations-including East Germany-to 
the United Nations. 

He was applauded warmly for his 
speech, and many people wished him 
good luck. "I appreciate this opportunity 
very much," he said to his audience. "I 
ask you to remember that the people who 
have made the greatest strides in history 
are the ones who have done what other 
men said could not be done."

Yale College 
The Fantasticks, America's longest-
running musical, proved to be Yale's most 
popular play of the week. Capacity 
audiences thundered their appreciation 
and called for the director each night 
(November 29-December 2). The theme 
of the play, the delicate world of innocent 
love being penetrated by the reality of 
pain and despair, is one which "has been 
going in and out of style but is guaranteed 
to raise a smile." Employing the 
Tinkerbelle-audience-involvement 
technique, made famous by Peter Pan, 
narrator-manipulator Ed Gallo lured the 
audience into remembering "that kind of 
September when no one wept except the 
willow." 

Director Ricardo Rodriguez heartily 
stressed the phantasmic nature of the play 
by suspending pastel gossamers from 
chandeliers in the dining room theater, 
by adorning the walls with snowflakes, 
and by making ingenious use of light-the 
strobe light in the mock battle scene and
