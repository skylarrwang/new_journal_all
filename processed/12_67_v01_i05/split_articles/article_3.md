On November 20th, Norman Mailer, sponsored by the English Department, gave the year's second Bergen Lecture in the Yale Law School Auditorium. 
His subject had been billed as "Some Thoughts On Censorship and Obscenity," but in a subtly bizarre fashion the audience ended up the topic of the evening.


Norman Mailer is a stocky; almost portly man who makes many claims for himself. One of them is that he is "the dwarf alter ego of Lyndon Johnson." Another is that he is 5'8". He has black hair streaked now with gray, hair so curly when it's not combed that it makes him look like a male Medusa from the Catskills. You can't be more precise in describing Norman Mailer because he partakes of so many things. That's not to say he's derivative, but rather to point out how much he so aptly represents the diversely gifted and diversely cursed society he has with such loyalty cajoled and harangued for years. His voice is nasal and rather high. He speaks quickly, and sounds like James Cagney with a Harvard accent. He has a habit of smiling and squinting his eyes and putting his hands on either side of his stomach. When he does this he looks like a magnate with a business secret, or perhaps your uncle about to tell a dirty joke.


Norman Mailer has rude charisma. He makes you think of W.C. Fields, of Mr. Hyde, of Erasmus, of Celine, of Lawrence, of Bierce, and so forth. Anyway you look at him, however, the honesty of his moral engagement with America isn't hard to see.


The overflow audience he faced was in high, slightly hysterical spirits-a college audience at a movie show. "Some Thoughts on Censorship and Obscenity" was a thrillingly vague title, on the order of "The Brides of Dracula." It was as much the uncertainty about what Norman Mailer might do as what he might say that had many in the audience leering into the abyss of scatological possibility, leering and, really, wanting to be pushed by this man who has had the misfortune to be in recent years a public aspect of our private minds.


Irredeemably engaged, he is the existential man made manifest, his essence revealed in a lot more ways than one. (He loves to speak of "existential" acts and moments.) He has allowed himself through his variegated notoriety to become a public scapegoat. If you take upon yourself the job of being a genuine existentialist hero, which Norman Mailer has done-of acting for everyone, with apocalyptic dispatch-then one of the consequences of your resolve is that everyone will have you act for them, in their stead, and laugh at you or hate you for it.


Norman Mailer is jeeringly, naggingly, vengefully forthright. He makes a lot of mistakes, and therefore he is an easy mark. Furthermore, it's open season on him all year round. You may find it hard to disagree with your spouse, your friendly neighborhood policeman, your Congressman, or the New York Times, but it's awfully easy to disagree with Norman Mailer. After all, we all know what good taste is.


He was probably a little nervous as he stepped over the aisle-sitters on his way to the podium, smiling his mysterious, engaging smile and wearing a battered Brooks Brothers trench-coat. Perhaps deliberately, his entrance was that of a prize-fighter making his way, in this case through scattered applause, towards the circumscribed arena in which he would engage in yet another contest. Once on stage, he took off his trench-coat, and you could almost read "NORMAN" stitched in gold letters across the back of it.


Mailer, a Harvard graduate, began with a joke about "Yalies", drew some hisses as well as laughter, and so initially tried to tease an unknown and threatening audience in a strange situation. He leaned forward and with a bit of difficulty rested his elbows on the podium, which apparently had been made for tall, honest, close-cropped lawyers and not for this Santa Claus-Hephaestus figure from Brooklyn. He gave his shoulders a bellicose hunch, looked out glitteringly at the audience, and declared, "What do you want me to do tonight. Is it going to be reading, or is it going to be extempore?" No answer from the pit; they didn't know what they wanted, though they did want something. He asked for a show of hands on the matter. "Extempore it is, then," he said, almost as if he were deciding "double or nothing," and, smiling, he stared at the faces that waited for him to begin. To begin speaking on "Censorship and Obscenity"? Well, maybe not, but to begin on something. He spoke now, somewhat haltingly, making some round-about jokes, one of which was about LBJ. He shook his bag of verbal tricks and came up with an uncharacteristically crippled metaphor that had to do with education and a surf board. He laughed when he realized he had actually said it. "Will someone please tell me what was wrong with that last metaphor?" he asked. This was an illuminating moment, Norman Mailer laughing at himself, fully capable of self-mockery and therefore having more both of an ability and a right to mock you than you had previously been willing to grant.


But the audience didn't laugh with Norman Mailer-it didn't understand him as he himself did-and at this point a contest began, Norman Mailer against the public, with Norman Mailer carrying the fight. "You people are pretty good at football, but you're pretty slow with your wits," he snapped. More hisses, applause, some jeers.


With that, Part I of An Evening With Norman Mailer got underway. He himself would probably call it, were he asked, Plan A. He was no longer speaking with, or to his audience, but at it and against it, and for a while at least, the audience was very much against him. He seemed to become smaller behind the podium, caught in the midst of a truly eclectic mass reaction that he himself had triggered.


For a while, the audience became a crowd, with no manners and no self-control. Norman Mailer had communicated to those he faced his own excitability, his irritability, and his impoliteness, but none of his subtle, ironic self-awareness, none of his deep, if crude, generosity and humor.


A female voice called with nervous petulance from the balcony: "What do you want from us?'' and there was a supporting boom from a number of voices seconding the question.


A student persisted in throwing wads of paper at him and was summarily invited to step up on stage. A microphone dialogue ensued, noteworthy mainly for the gusto with which Norman Mailer good-humoredly refused to take other than lightly the student's complaint about being bored. When he said to the boy "I thought I was being pretty funny," the boy answered "That's why I was bored," and the house roared.
