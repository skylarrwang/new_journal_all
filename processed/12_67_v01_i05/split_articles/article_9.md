a spiraling light which projected patterns 
on the audience during the hypnotic 
dance scene. 

But the primary ingredient for success 
was the cast. Trumbull's production 
exhibited a cast of extraordinary ability. 
Spirited and talented, they brought 
strength to the play, making every 
moment vital. The small-cast musical is 
evidently the play most suited to the 
collegiate theatrical scene. It is doubtful 
that there are many as captivating and 
enchanting as Th~ Fantasticks.

The actors in the Timothy Dwight 
production of Peter Shaffer's two one-act 
plays, The Private Ear and Th~ Public 
Ey~, succeeded very well in making both 
meaningful and entertaining what are 
essentially actionless plays. 

The little action in each play consisted 
of variations of triangle situations, which 
are revealed early in the plays, thus 
removing any suspense. What is left is 
only Shaffer's subtle humor and his not so 
subtle message-how context-bound 
language and lack of common experience 
prevent people from communicating. 

To be sure, the plays are constructed 
so that either humor or message could be 
emphasized, but the TD production 
managed to handle one without slighting 
the other. The best scenes were those in 
which non-communication and non-
understanding were themseives the central 
issues. This included the silent resolution 
of Public Ey~. The directors, Peter 
Schwenger of Eye and Leonard Barkan of 
Ear, both did fine jobs.

**Games**

Games 
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, as they 
say in Biology, and so it goes with 
Harvard weekend in particular, and all 
weekends in general. Everything seems to 
be building up and letting down, from 
hopeful Friday on downhill to hopeless 
Sunday afternoon, just as on all other 
weekends-only a thousand times more 
so because of the mothers and fathers 
added to the usual droves of dates. The 
streets seem to be suddenly awash with 
giggly blonde girls getting dress bags out 
of the trunks of their illegally parked 
cars, and boys' rooms are full of people 
who jus~ slog along Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, and then on Saturday serve 
up that life in pithy self-mocking epithets 
at parties. But having the parents around 
makes it all quite different; for one thing 
it gets in the way of a date, having the 
four of you aU there in that traveling 
suburbia of station wagons parked in the 
field at the Bowl, with the perhaps 
mother-in-law looking you up and down. 

A girl can be made to feel extremely 
nervous by almost any act perpetrated by 
that mother of his in her purple tweed 
Darien, Conn., suit and her thermoses of 
bloody marys and coffee ( .. coffee, 
please") and her maddening way of 
climbing her son, as it were, and putting 
flags on top of him, and telling him to 
keep Saturday the 12th free. 

Which thing is she thinking behind her 
polite conversation: Call me Mother? 
She's awfully attractive, John? I hope 
you're having lots and lots of fun and 
seeing all kinds of girls? Does be want to 
know if I'm loyal enough to the old 
school? Well damn Harvard, damn Yale. 
Fab, All, Tide, Lux and Veritas-bahl It's 
terribly hard, if you only have sort of 
ad hoc loyalties, to grasp quite why 
people get so excited about it all. It's 
understandable, it's touching-to see 
these fathers and sons going down the 
streets to hear the sons crisply declaiming 
about their existence at college, as if they 
were trying to grab one frame from the 
film of their present life and say, There, 
that's typical of me, this minute, at Yale 
-and to see their fathers hardly listening, 
fumbling around for the old yellowed 
photograph that was them, dressed up in 
old-fashioned clothes, in front of a 
building that's been torn down since Yale 
'35. They seem to think they've got 
something enormous in common, and 
they are building on the idea that plus 
3a change, plus c'est la mem~ Yale, and 
oh, nothing like Harvard, etc., etc. But 
we impartial outsiders ask ourselves. 

After all, the students, the teachers, the 
very buildings are different, it's just that 
ugly little dog that's the same, compli-
ments of the continuity editor. Well, give 
it up, you probably have to just take it on 
faith like the Virgin Birth. Indeed, there 
they all are at The Game, taking it on 
faith like madmen and acting out year 
after year their serio-comic rivalry they've 
inherited along with their name and their 
nose. 

Then there are all those undergraduates 
and recent graduates to watch-especially 
them because their illusions about Yale 
are not so cold in their graves. It's funny 
to watch them being edgy and senti-
mental, half laughing at their old haunts 
and organizations--Spaghetti and Grapes, 
Bible and Belt-and half going there 
wholeheartedly. Three or four years out, 
the recent fates of the old heroes and the 
old drunks are more interesting to bear 
about than later on, because no one is 
quite sure whether whatshisname 
fulfilled his early promise and drank 
himself to death, or whether be copped 
out and joined the First Nat City Bank, 
and plenty of them are still wandering 
around in a way that would never get 
into the Alumni Magazine. "Last time I 
heard he was in some nudist colony in 
Majorca writing a nov~l." And the ones 
who come for the weekend and find each 
other still have a tendency to call what-
ever they're doing a game-the ad game, 
the poverty game, the God game-so 
no-one will think they've gotten too 
stuffy about themselves. These ones bring 
their dates for a nostalgic weekend to 
show them (don't touch) a good time, 
and how it used to be, and to take them 
to the old room which is now full of 
noisy, immature strangers. Some girls 
have an almost unbelievable capacity for 
tactful participation in other people's 
fantasies-which is what Harvard week-
end, haunting the old town, and especially 
football, are. But what is most peculiar 
especially to a girl who has long since 
slammed her mind shut on the possibility 
of ever understanding the actual rules of 
the game is to think that all of these 
people who have summoned up in their 
minds some feeling of the quiddity of 
their college then go and endow a very 
football player with it, and get satisfaction 
from having him enact a ritual put-down 
of the other colleges by proxy. It's as if 
two men with two interpreters thought 
they were having an argument, when in 
fact the two interpreters, in their own 
language, were arguing about something 
entirely different. 

People don't just watch it, they 
castigate it, wheedle it, threaten it, woo 
it, like schizophrenics holding conversa-
tions with the wall. The basic premise 
that both teams accept, namely that we 
are wonderful and that they are terrible 
(or if their team loses, how wronged they 
were) prompts them to astonishing acts 
of screaming and toilet paper throwing 
and other behavior that would be severely 
frowned upon, say, in the subway. 

Luckily you can sometimes get your 
date to ignore it part of the time, like a 
taxi radio droning on in the background 
by being, yourself, a contrapuntal taxi 
radio .... Sarah Bernhardt had her leg 
amputated, you know ... when is a door 
not a door ... I wish the toe fetishist 
would come and warm up my feet ... 
they say watching football gives you 
cancer ... though sooner or later you are 
cut off by the rising in unison multitudes, 
and inevitably you are drowned out by 
the prayers and lambastings of the man 
behind you, try as you will to stare him 
down or embarrass him with a telephoto 
lens. 

Strange to say, it doesn't seem to 
bother the dates, though, who almost to a 
girl will admit they don't know what 
those men are doing on that field, 
knuckling around in slow motion to the 
inner music of the spheres-and for the 
most part they jump and scream in a 
manner that seems very hypocritical to 
some of us who stick to our guns and 
remain seated throughout. It's the twofold 
mystery of the game itself, and the blood 
of Yale. Blood is thicker than water, and 
bloody marys, drunk on the tailgate with 
... with, well hello ... if it isn't ... you 
son of a gun .•• thicker still.
