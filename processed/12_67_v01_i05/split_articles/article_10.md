Seeger 
"This machine surrounds hate and 
makes it surrender," read the neat letten 
on Pete Seeger's long-necked, five-string 
banjo. You could read the words if you 
were sitting down front at his Woolsey 
Hall concert on Harvard Weekend. 

With purple light shining on his face, 
Seeger sings and preaches about the old 
songs, and also sings some he's just found 
about Americans making stands, violent 
and otherwise, against injustice through-
out our history. 

This time Seeger looks a little older 
than he did when you last saw him. 
Though he's still as long and lean as a 
farm kid, the skin on his face wrinkles 
and pouches like an old baseball glove. 
But when he begins to sing, a wonder-
ful thing happens. He sings out to the 
audience, his head high, his chin way up. 
And as the audience gathers momentum 
and sings back to him in waves, you 
notice that with his head high and back, 
the pouches and lines on his face 
disappear. 

Seeger always does things his own 
way: Even at Woolsey, you, who never 
thought you could, wind up respecting 
him for singing heck instead of hell. He 
Jives with his wife Toshi and their three 
children in a tiny log cabin on the 
Hudson, sixty miles north of New York 
City. Seeger built the cabin himself with 
a little help from his friends. He doesn't 
think twice about turning down concert 
engagements to tour Negro colleges in 
the South or play at peace fairs. 

Back in 1938, before Time magazine 
showed the hippies the way to Haight-
Asbbury and before Jack Kerouac 
dreamed of bitting the road, Pete Seeger, 
a Harvard sophomore, left Cambridge. 
In the next years, he covered thousands 
of miles, hitchhiking and riding freight 
cars, through our depression-ridden 
country. He was singing and picking up 
folk songs. 

Descended from American colonists 
who came here beca~e they were 
religious dissenters, Pete Seeger was 
learning America and her history in song. 
He took time out to serve three years 
with the Special Services during World 
War II. But he was still collecting songs-
army songs this time. 

By the late 50's Seeger was performing 
before capacity crowds at Carnegie and 
Town Halls. The folk song revival that he 
helped to create was in full swing. 

In 1955, Seeger refused to answer 
questions about his political associations 
and belief when asked by a subcommittee 
of the House Un-American Activities 
Committee. The committee was 
investigating alleged subversive influences 
in the entertainment field. 

Seeger cited his rights to freedom of 
speech and association guaranteed by the 
F"arst Amendment to the Constitution. 
The Fifth Amendment, to avoid self-
incrurunation, might have been an easier 
way out. With the Fifth he could have 
• avoided prosecution. · 

Seeger was cited for contempt of 
Congress on ten counts. A New York 
court found him guilty and sentenced him 
to one year in jail. This decision was 
reversed only a few years ago by the 
unanimous decision of the United States 
Court of Appeals. 

"I have never in my life supported or 
done anything subversive to my 
country," said Seeger at the time of his 
sentencing. "I am proud I never refused 
t~ sing for any organization because I 
diSagreed with its belief." 

To illustrate this, Seeger offered to sing 
a song in the courtroom. He was denied 
permission.
