More Stately Mansions: 
Eugene O'Neill at a crossroad 
By Albert Rothenberg, M.D. 
More Stately Mansions, currently playing 
in New York, is probably the last play of 
Eugene O'Neill that will ever have an 
American premiere. Every other play that 
he wrote has been produced, published 
and ignored, or been destroyed forever. 
Psychologically, it is somehow fitting that 
this play should appear here long after 
all major O'Neill plays have been pro-
duced. It is an unfinished work, but more 
than almost any other O'Neill play it 
reveals a pervading issue in the back-
ground of his entire dramaturgy: the 
psychological relationship between 
himself and his mother. 

Furthermore, More Stately Mansions 
was written immediately prior to the two 
O'Neill masterpieces, The Iceman 
Cometh and Long Day's Journey Into 
Night and seems to contain the raw 
material out of which those plays arose. 
Its characters speak the inner turmoil and 
the beginnings of wisdom which O'Neill 
was only able to harness into artistic 
greatness in the later plays. 

More Stately Mansions was meant to 
be the fourth play in O'Neill's cycle of 
nine plays about the history of an 
American family from revolutionary 
times to the present. This cycle was to be 
entitled, A Tale of Possessors Self-
dispossessed. More Stately Mansions was 
written during what appeared to the 
world as O'Neill's fa1low period, between 
the production of Days Without End in 
1 934 and the first production of The 
Iceman C~meth in 1946. Far from being 
truly unproductive during this period, 
O'Neill was· actively at work the entire 
time on drafts of the cycle plays and his 
five completed last plays. 

Of the nine or possibly eleven planned 
plays in the cycle, only A Touch of the 
Poet and More Stately Mansions are 
extant. In 1953, O'Neill burned at least 
six cycle plays in their scenario or rough 
draft form because he wanted no-one 
else to finish them. It is of interest that 
More Stately Mansions survived this 
literary holocaust. In their biography of 
O'Neill, the Gelbs suggest that another 
version of the play was on hand and 
presumably O'Neill overlooked or forgot 
about the surviving draft. However, 
O'Neill had always been highly scrupu-
lous and perfectionistic about his writings 
throughout his life. I don't think, there-
fore, that I would be making too much 
psychiatric hay over this circumstance 
by suggesting that O'Neill may have been 
unconsciously motivated to allow this 
play to survive. In the light of what the 
play reveals, it seems possible that he had 
some need to expose the underlying 
psychodynamics of his relationship to 
his mother. 

Another circumstance in the history of 
!his play bespeaks its psychological 
1mportance to O'Neill. As far as we 
know, he was actively working on More 
Sta!ely Mansions in February, 1939, but 
he mterrupted his work to write the 
entire The Iceman Cometh and then 
immediately turned to Long Day's 
Journey Into Night. There is a good deal

of reason to believe that the story of The 
Iceman Cometh had intense personal 
importance to O'Neill. It is set in the year 
1912 and portrays an actual bar he 
frequented at that time. Many of the 
characters are composites of people 
whom he knew. Furthermore, the year 
1912 had special significance for O'Neill: 
It was the year he made a serious suicide 
attempt and was divorced from his first 
wife; it was the year he entered a 
tuberculosis sanatorium and began to 
write plays; it was a year during which 
his mother returned to her drug habit. 

In addition, elements in The Iceman 
Cometh suggest that his relationship to 
his mother may have been specifically on 
his mind when he wrote this play. The 
young man in the play, Parritt, a char-
acter who bears a good deal of 
resemblance to O'Neill in his youth, is 
depicted as having betrayed his mother 
and all the derelicts are caught up in " pipe 
dreams," a choice of term which 
strikingly conjures up the image of Ella 
O'Neill's drug addiction. 

There is, of course, no doubt that Ella's 
drug addiction was very much on 
O'Neill's mind when he wrote Long 
Day's Journey Into Night. This play was . 
also set in the year 1912 and it would 
seem that the concerns or inspirations 
which led O'Neill to interrupt the 
writing of More Stately Mansions 
continued to operate in both of the next 
two plays. 

More Stately Mansions is a family 
story. It concerns Simon and Sara 
Harford, the young couple who are 
about to marry at the end of A Touch of 
the Poet, and Simon's mother, Deborah, 
who appears briefly in that play. In More 
Stately Mansions, Simon becomes an 
immensely successful businessman and 
gets caught up in a triangle involving 
himself, Sara and Deborah. 

Strikingly, the mother Deborah is 
depicted as a woman who throughout 
Simon's life withdrew into a summer 
house where she fantasied herself as a 
king's courtesan. This is not the first time 
O'Neill portrayed a woman who is 
trapped or traps herself in a house. 
Mourning Becomes Electra and Strange 
Interlude are previous examples of this 
theme. It is the first time, however, that 
O'Neill portrayed a character whose 
behavior was so closely analagous 
to that of his own mother. Although 
Deborah is not a narcotics addict she is 
strongly reminiscent of the mother Mary 
in Long Day's Journey Into Night who 
withdraws into a special room upstairs to 
take her morphine. Actually, the O'Neill 
house in New London has a summer 
house on the grounds which is exactly 
like that described in More Stately 
Mansions and it is possible that Ella 
O'Neill herself withdrew there. 

In order to spell out the particular 
ways in which More Stately Mansions 
depicts the underlying psychological 
relationship between O'Neill and his 
mother, I would first like to review 
Edmund's relationship to his mother in 
Long Day's Journey Into Night, assuminl 
it is a naturalistic play. In other words, I 
will talk about the relationship between 
Edmund and his mother as if it were a 
real relationship between two living 
people. In doing this, I will not be violat-
ing the aesthetic context of the play since 
it is a psychological tragedy and does not 
seem to be symbolic or directed to a social

Nicholas Ray's BIHer Victory (1957) 
Richard Burton, Curd Jurgens 
"One of the most anguished statements on film." 
Confusion, ambivalence, and alienation in a 
poetic and philosophical war film that by contrast 
demonstrates the hollow verbiage of phony 
masterpieces like Guns of Navarone and Bridge 
on the River Kwai.
