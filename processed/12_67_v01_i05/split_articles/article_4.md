Norman Mailer claimed, "This 
gentleman has just employed the 
technique of the Big Lie," then sportingly 
allowed that the boy had won the round. 
But that didn't settle matters, for the 
matinee festivity of the occasion had by 
this time been transformed into what 
might be called a bread-and-circuses 
blood-lust on the part of the (by this 
time) mob. 

For the next twenty minutes Norman 
Mailer sparred with various voices in the 
melee: "Hey, why don't you read 
something, Mr. Mailer?" 
"So far this evening, Mr. Mailer, all 
you've done here is make an ass of 
yourself .... " 
"I disagree, and I'm on your side, Mr. 
Mailer. Come on and put down President 
Johnson!" 
At one point, somebody called, again 
from the balcony, "Come on and say 
something!" 
· 
Norman Mailer roared "FUG yoo!" 
in reply, which may have been a piece of 
splendid impromptu mockery on both 
himself and the mob. For hadn't many 
come primarily to hear Norman Mailer 
swear in public, and hadn't Norman 
Mailer, way back in 1948, scandalized 
the public at large by his daring use of 
fug (here for the first time, if you don't 
count Ulysses) in The Naked and the 
Dead? 

For a while he was like Horatio at the 
Bridge. The heckling and applauding 
continued, the audience, if you could call 
it that, completely disunited and dis-
oriented. No one knew what was 
happening, least of all, you began to feel, 
Norman Mailer. He had tried for a 
grandstand play by opting for extempore, 
and he'd missed the ball completely. The 
people before him were close to being 
entirely out of control, and as the 
situation proceeded minute after minute 
unchanged, the heroic element in it of one 
gladiator facing an enemy host vanished, 
to be replaced by the sense that what was 
happening was not merely an unfortunate 
mistake, but an unpleasant one. 

All at once, Norman Mailer seemed 
Punchy, a set-up of a kind, not noble in 
the least, but "almost, at times, the 
Fool." The clarity of the issues underlying 
the confrontation that was taking place 
had become blurred. 

All you saw was a short little man with 
a pink face and a lot of dark curly hair 
waving his arms in front of a bunch of 
people who would like nothing better 
than to see him go down-although not, 
perhaps, until he had exposed himself in 
the process. 

Re disappointed them. Suddenly, he 
cut down a questioner/heckler in mid-
sentence and announced he had decided 
to read something after all. It was much 
too long, he said, but he'd do the best he 
COuld with it, anyhow. 
Part II of An Evening With Norman 
~ailer began; Plan B went into effect. 
•. ue noise subsided as, with the delibera-
110n of a snail, he shuffled through a 
sheaf of papers he took from a slim 
attache-case of olive drab leather. The 
J)apers he hefted seemed to have the 
"eiabt of galley proofs. They lent biro an 
~~f academic seriousness, as was no 
-uot his wish. 

"Now rd like to read a selection from 
~avorite magazine," he announced. 
~thing fluttered in his hand, a single 
~of paper, and he read about a man 
91 
~rank whiskey from a tea-cup in 
asbington and who boozily spoke of 
"shit" and LBJ in the same breath, most 
disrespectfully. 

"Where's this from?" asked Norman 
Mailer, not quite willing to let his debate 
with the public evaporate completely. 
"Time magazine!" some voices called 
back to him. 

From then on, the polarities of the 
situation were appreciably reversed, and 
almost everyone, socially and dynami-
cally, was on Norman Mailer's side. If 
it's easy to disagree with Norman Mailer, 
you can't not disagree with Time. Unless 
you're Norman Mailer, that is, for what 
followed was not, really, something 
which undercut or invalidated Time's 
account of Norman Mailer's actions on 
the weekend of the Washington March, 
but rather it was a long autobiographical 
article which, while explaining his actions 
there, revealed that what Time reported 
was, after all, substantially correct, as far 
as the facts went, anyway. 

This evening at Yale, he had lost his 
audience through what seemed to be the 
poor execution of a nicely conceived 
rhetorical stance. He now proceeded to 
recapture popular support by reading 
about what life was like in front of 
another auditorium crowd, that one in 
Washington and apparently as unruly and 
unpredictable as the one he was now 
facing. 

He read about that other audience so 
quickly that at times you thought he was 
reading French-the rather Gallic rush 
of dependent clauses and then the verb, 
with uncertain inflection, like something 
falling off a table, yet giving you the 
impression, because of its uncertainty of 
tone, that it meant a lot more than met 
the ear. 

He read about being on stage in 
Washington with Dwight MacDonald, 
Robert Lowell, and Paul Goodman. He 
read about, or rather elaborated on, what 
Time had reported with such spinsterish 
grandiloquence: missing the bowl in the 
men's room qua universal male experi-
ence; his "strong arm" tactics in usurping 
the position of m.c.; his notorious (yet) 
statement that "LBJ is as full of crap as 
I am." 

What he read was all the more striking 
(vivid and exact as it was) for what had 
preceded. The care and logic of what 
could only be called art began to assert 
itself against disorder. His description of 
Lowell on the Washington stage (LoweU, 
imposing, ambivalent, repelled by the 
crowd that looked at him, feeling com-
pelled to be on its side, to read from 
Lord Weary's Castle to those about to 
face the army protecting the Pentagon) 
was what many in the Law School 
Auditorium said later was the best 
moment of the night. 

And Norman Mailer read about being 
raucously alone in front of the Washing-
ton audience, which he couldn't see but 
whose mixed reaction he could hear. And 
he read of stepping from the stage and 
noting, again with self-irony, that no 
one stood up to applaud birO. 

He read with increasing rapidity, so 
that he sometimes slurred the words he 
had written with such care and earnest-
ness. After Part II/ Plan B had been 
going on for about forty minutes, some-
one-in the balcony-yelled "Slower!" 

Genuinely worried about taking too 
much time, of losing the audience he had 
rewon. he was irked to think he might be 
doing just that. He stopped reading and 
said that those who wanted to go could 
go and those who wanted to stay could 
stay. He'd be done in ten or fifteen 
minutes. 

Perhaps fifty people, or about 5% of 
the audience, left the auditorium. When 
people sat down again, you could see a 
few empty seats like shell holes here and 
there. Genial were the faithful now that 
the bored, the disappointed, the angry, 
and the sleepy had quit the scene. 

A few minutes later, Norman Mailer 
said "Thank you" and left the podium. 
Perhaps mindful of the Washington 
crowd whom they had just heard about 
and to whom by implication they had 
been compared, many in the audience 
now stood as they clapped to Norman 
Mailer's exit. He grinned a little at this 
obvious triumph, and with trench-coat 
and attache case went out of the 
auditorium. 

What, finally, had happened? Ap-
parently, "you got two shows for the 
price of one," as a bemused young lady 
put it afterward. You'd been put down 
a Ia Lenny Bruce, and you'd been lifted 
back up again as you are by a good book 
or a good painting or, for that matter, a 
good joke. 

Where had "Censorship and 
Obscenity" come in, though? What you 
ended up with was really neither fish nor 
fowl. Or rather, it was both, a declama-
tory bouillabaisse mixed in subtle 
proportions and dished out with a 
sprezzatura all the more impressive for its 
rowdiness, once you'd thought about it. 

Nor man Mailer had first of all made 
the audience look at itself by reading 
about another audience whose actions 
had mirrored those of its own. The 
ordinary conventions of speaker-
audience relations had been broken up in 
such a way as to allow the audience to 
become, finally, the subject the speaker 
was concerned with. 

Censorship, after all, has to do with 
intolerance, which, in turn, comes from 
fear-the fear (to put it one way) that 
what you rely on is wrong, or that you're 
not who you think you are. 

People were amazed, disgusted, 
delighted, or disturbed by Norman 
Mailer in the Law School, and their 
reactions, varied as they were, reminded 
you of one thing: that censorship is bred 
as much from being caught with your 
pants down as from ignorance and 
superstition. 

Professor R.W.B. Lewis has likened 
Norman Mailer's most recent novel, 
Why Are We In Vietnam?, to "a 
rabbinical terror sermon." The talk at 
Yale was a speech as process, rather than 
product-if you will, a sermon of sorts: 
Norman Martin Mailer Luther. 

Drinking bourbon in a Law School 
lounge minutes later, Norman Mailer 
chatted with students about writing 
novels, about football, about this and 
that. He smiled a lot, mysterious, 
avuncular. He talked a lot, ebullient, 
expansive, always "gracious", however, 
especially with the ladies, the Richard 
Burton of the literary world taking off 
the grease-paint with alcohol. Finally he 
put on his trench-coat, and looking a 
little like Vic Gatto in a field-poncho, he 
departed to take a late train. The next 
day the Law School would be up in arms 
about a balcony door, which had been 
taken off its hinges by some people 
anxious for seats who had found it 
locked. The Law School said the English 
Department could never use the Law 
School Auditorium again. •
