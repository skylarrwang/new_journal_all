Kingman Brewster in 
television's department of 
clarification 
By Daniel Y ergin 

President Brewster's office phoned the 
producers of the David Susskind Show in 
New York City after Brewster's Parents 
Day Speech and offered them a package: 
Brewster, the Rev. William Sloane 
Coffin and Yale corporation member J. 
Irwin Miller, discussing the draft, civil 
disobedience, conscientious objection and 
related issues. 

The idea for the show grew out of the 
controversy surrounding the Parents Day 
Speech, in which Brewster had seemed to 
attack Coffin by criticizing "strident 
voices which urge draft resistance as a 
political tactic." As with many Brewster 
pronouncements, some thought Brewster 
had a specific target-the Rev. Coffin, 
while others weren't quite sure what 
Brewster had been saying or whom he had 
been attacking. Thus the show would be 
an effort at clarification. 

The show worked; issues and 
personalities were clarified. One came to 
some understanding of how thinks J. 
Irwin Miller, former president of the 
National Council of Churches, Esquire's 
nominee for President, the Corporation 
member supposedly closest to Brewster, 
and part of the band of enlightened 
industrialists who allow themselves doubts 
about Vietnam. 

Coffin, the minority on the 21h to llh 
line-up (host Susskind was versatile) 
outlined the tragic absurdities of 
Vietnam and made clear why resistance is 
necessary. The idea of giving "sanctuary 
for consci~nce" within a church, he said, 
"is not to shield a man but to show that 
the claims of government and the claims 
of conscience cannot be reconciled." 

Perhaps, most importantly, there 
seemed to emerge an idea of what's 
behind Brewster's pronouncements-
that is, how the man views the world. 

The show was taped in New York on 
Monday, November 27, for broadcast on 
December 10. Most of the audience of 
1 00 arrived at the television studio on 
67th Street around six o'clock in the 
evening, many of them passing the 
mangled body of a young woman who 
had just jumped to her death from a 
nearby apartment. 

Inside, host Susskind carne forward to 
sit on a stool and warm up the audience 
with a few charming comments, a few 
abrasive comments designed to get the 
audience angry enough to come to the 
microphones to ask questions during the 
program, a few pompous comments, a 
few humorous ones. 

Then the big voice of the invisible 
director came over the loudspeaker, 
ordering Susskind up on the stage so that 
the taping session could begin. 

Susskind's first question went to 
Brewster: are you worried about a 
militant and violent turn in the protest on 
your campus? 

"No, it's not militant in the violent 
sense," said Brewster, much as be had 
responded to the question, how 
widespread is student revolt, on Meet the 
Press last year with, "It's more wide-
spread than revolting." 

"Violence is disturbing," be went on to 
explain to Susskind, "but protest on the 
Yale campus has not taken a violent 
turn." 

"The amount of judgment the students 
have combined with their passion is 
magnificent," added Coffin, but he warned 
that there could very well be violence in 
the future. "1. don't say we should 
condone it," said the reverend, "but we 
should not condemn it without looking at 
what's caused it." 

The first part of the show continued in 
this vein, with Brewster warning of the 
dangers of violence begetting violence 
and of ignoring laws, while Coffin asked 
compassion for students so appalled by 
the violence in Vietnam and so frustrated 
by normal political channels that they 
turn to demonstrations. 

Miller sat quietly through this, his 
mouth slightly open, frowning, his eyes 
on the stage floor, as though he were 
about to say, "What am I hearing, my ean 
must be deceiving me, this sounds lik~ 
like treason." But Miller turned out notto 
be that way. He agreed with Brewster 
about violence begetting violence. If 
another boy slugged his son, said Miller, 
it would not in tum be proper for his son 
to slug back and then say, "He did it and 
so can 1." 

Miller is a lanky man whose high 
motivations seem to have led him into 
several quandaries about the war; and so, 
unsure which course is right, he tends to 
go along with the establishment of which 
he is a member. But only "tends." For 
instance, be believes strongly in rule of 
law, which means that be does not like 
demonstrations, but he also happens to be 
a religious man. So, when a student from 
a Long Island college asked Coffin why 
ministers and priests don't stick to the 
religion and leave the rest of life alone, 
Miller insisted on answering. He said that 
religion, if it is to mean anything, must 
deal with daily behavior and not Sunday 
School attendance. (To the student's 
question, CQffin simply replied, "I think 
that position was first taken by the 
Pharaoh to Moses.") Even more obvious 
is the conflict between Miller as moral 
and intelligent man and Miller as 
businessman. He is self-conscious about 
it. At one point, be jokingly began a 
sentence, "As a craven businessman . ... " 

The sensitivity is there, the awareness that 
profit and motive too easily function as 
one word. All a scholar has to do is worrY 
whether the things he does have any 
meaning or importance; a businessman co Â· 
the other band must worry whether his 
livelihood is by definition in opposition 
to his values. Miller really sounded like 
a college recruiter complaining that 
students don't want to go into business 
when he complained that college students 
don't want to get involved within the 
political system. 

Miller clearly wanted to examine the 
merits of Vietnam, and come to a 
conclusion; but so far he hasn't been able 
to. Given the choice between two 
uncomfortable outlooks, he seems to 
choose that of his friends in government 
and business, the one more naturally 
congenial to him. Thus the danger of 
student violence in this country becomes 
greater, and the importance of our 
Vietnam violence consequently 
diminishes. 

"Bill," he said at one point, drawing 
out the name in a Hoosier twang. ''you'~ 
trying to say that this bonfire over here IS 
really over here . ... " 

"No, I'm not, Irwin." said Coffin. 
"You're trying to make a bonfire out of 1 
brushfire, while I'm pointing to the real 
conflagration."
