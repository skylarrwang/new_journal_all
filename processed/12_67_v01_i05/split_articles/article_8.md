The position Miller takes or doesn't 
take on the war is important because be is 
1eG 
a very influential industrialist. Similarly, 
it's important to understand what 
Brewster thinks not simply because he's 
pnsident of Yale but because he has 
..umed the role of spokesman for higher 
education, serves on Presidential 
commissions, and is called Dr. Brewster 
at 
D 
to 
l 
), 
by David Susskind. 

On the Susskind show Brewster relied 
much less on inflated rhetoric and spoke 
much more clearly than he has on most 
previous public occasions. He was 
uaderstandable, and you cou1d respect 
him for his convictions. He does believe 
ill conscientious objection for moral 
1a10ns, he thinks a man should not be 
fon:ed to kill if he doesn't want to kill. 
He attempted to clarify his Parents Day 
"'lrident voices" statement by saying 
lblt he did not mean Coffin, although 
Brewster discusses Coffin in the next four 
out of five paragraphs in the speech and 
.._.in the speech disagrees with Coffin's 
polition on the draft and deplores his 
penonal style. Brewster thus did not 
IUCCCed in making clear whom be did 
have in mind, if anybody, when he 
c:riticized the "strident voices." 

Brewster said that he wasn't willing to 
criticize the war unless he could take over 
the next morning at nine and offer 
alternatives. Brewster asked Coffin what 
alternatives he wou1d have at nine the 
next morning. 

Coffin mentioned a variety of 
approaches, but he would have done 
better simply to raise the problem of 
iatention; for this is a basic problem. 
Pluta and specific proposals are 
implementation; they devolve from an 
09er-all intention, not the other way 
around. For Brewster to worry about the 
lpeciftc "how's" means finally that he 
doesn't think the United States should 
aet out. Yet the war remains a confusing 
thing for him. 

The problem becomes one of 
&eneralization. The facts of the situation, 
the ugly facts, seem to say one thing; but 
JOur theory tells you something else. You 
lllalte the decision to go with the theory, 
bat you remain troubled and confused 
because reality does not fit snugly within 
the generalization. 

Brewster too views the world with 
certain basic assumptions that grate 
banhly with the reality of the war as be 
perceives it in the tolls of death, 
destruction, incredibility, and lack of 
PI'Ogress. 

He gave three reasons why he thought 
that. while draft resistance on personal 
1b0ra1 grounds was permissible, resistance 
lilould not be used for political ends-
::.. to change the policy. First, he simply 
't think it wou1d be helpfu1 in 
cla.nging the political situation. Secondly, 
he said, "it is terribly important for us not 
tiD abandon the force of persuasion for 
il iavites the forces of oppressive counter-
l'eYolution." Thirdly, he opposes it on 
llloral grounds because it's not the 
PIOduct of individual conscience. 

Coftin responded that draft resistance 
4ld DOt at this point mean rejection of 
Pll'luuion, but was rather a form of 
Jlnuasion. "We are doing it," he said, 
""-cause we care about the finest of 
~ 
traditions. which are being 
~ed." 

BreWster rejected this interpretation, 
1lbic:b finds its models in the efforts of the 
ciYil rights activists and claims that there 
"ouucl be no Dissenting Democrats nor a 
Candidate McCarthy were it not for the 
student activists. 

Towards the end of the taping, what 
•seemed to be Brewster's fundamental 
assumptions finally began to emerge. Ever 
since Johnson put Brewster onto the 
commissi<'n studying the entire selective 
service system, Brewster has spoken out 
about what be considers unfair and 
immoral aspects of the system. 

Brewster nodded his head 'in agreement 
when a student in the audience prefaced 
a question on this attitude by saying that 
the draft had almost been abolished in 
the early 1960's. Then, asked the student, 
how can you talk about the morality of 
the draft, a system that will always be 
unpleasant no matter how administered, 
and not about the morality of the war, of 
which the draft is only manifestation and 
symptom? 

Brewster explained that he thinks a 
system must be worked out because the 
United States will face a series of other 
such wars over the next several years. 

Some might choose to see this response 
as a sign of Brewster's pragmatism, that 
be's interested in reforming one evil if be 
can't reform two. 

It seems more likely, however, that this 
was a hint at Brewster's basic attitude; 
and by implication, his disagreement with 
the war finally becomes nothing more 
than disagreement with how the war is 
being conducted. He seems to accept the 
notion that the Communists (emphasizing 
the) are and will continue to foment wars 
of national liberation to extend a 
Communist hegemony. If you believe that 
and so downplay or even ignore the 
nationalistic elements, then the Com-
munists do have to be stopped and 
Vietnam is the stopping ground. 

A question disturbing many is bow the 
men who were the liberals in the late 
1940's and early 1950's can regard the 
world that way today. But it should not 
be forgotten that many of them, like 
Brewster, worked in the Marshall Plan, 
which, while a tremendously impressive 
and benign program in many ways, came 
about as a reaction to the fear of 
Communist domination extending over 
Western Europe. 

The world has changed a great deal 
since then, but the only change that seems 
to have occurred in the thinking of many 
policymakers is geographic: the capital 
of "international aggressive Communism" 
bas moved from Moscow to Peking. 

Anybody who looked at Soviet Com-
munism in 1948 as he did in 1928, when 
that country was slipping into the throes 
of industrialization and collectivization, 
would have been considered rigid in his 
thinking. Another 20 years and another 
generation have now gone past; but, 
because there have been no dramatic 
events like depression and cold war, too 
many people have permitted the old ideas 
to remain unchallenged in their minds. 

The world view apparently held by 
Brewster needs rethinking; for what the 
Susskind show finally did was clarify the 
causes of Brewster's indecision and 
cqnfusion over Vietnam: on the one hand, 
he sees that almost everything is wrong 
with our War in Vietnam; on the other, 
he accepts the basic assumptions which 
make possible the war. 

Coffin had a good point when be 
objected to people "who can't make up 
their minds about the war, but point to 
the immorality of the protestors and not 
to the immorality of the war." •
