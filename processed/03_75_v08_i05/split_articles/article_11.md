" I would like to add," said Scott 
O'Brien, the treasurer and only paid 
worker for the YHAP, "that we keep 
all money separated. For instance, 
the orrly money we use for office ex-
penses is that which is explicitly ear-
marked." 

Many experts agree that the pre-
sent world food situation represents 
a true crisis. The word "crisis" origi-
nated from the medical term-a 
turning point in a fever. Doctors 
knew that the body must work to 
overcome a disease and if the fever 
did not abate the patient would die. 
The world 's industrial fever will last 
until man, hopefully, realizes that 
progress means slowing down. 
"This is a spiritual revolution as 
great as that which led to the advent 
of Christianity," said the anthro-
pologist Claude Levi-Strauss. A 
change like this takes many years. 
The highest hopes of the YHAP 
would be to influence Yale students 
who may one day work in busi-
nesses or government positions that 
affect world affairs. 
"There are 300,000 persons in the 
U.S. who have signed petitions say-
ing they're willing to eat less to feed 
the hungry and the undernour-
ished-this is the people speaking," 
said Herbert Walters, the Chairman 
of the World Hunger Action 
Coalition. 
The fast day organized by Oxfam 
(a world relief organization centered 
in London) on November 21 of last 
year included 400 universities and 
500 church and community groups. 
Students at Grinnel College in 
Grinnel, Iowa, have a weekly hunger 
newspaper and invite speakers regu-
larly to the college. They have initi-
ated seminars on the subject and on 
February 15 devoted five days to dis-
cuss what the students at Grinnel 
College could do. 
High school students at East 
Catholic High School in Manchester , 
Connecticut raised $10,000 in 
The New Journal I March 26, 1975 
a Fast-a-thon whereby merchants 
paid a dollar per hour for a fasting 
student . "A few weeks prior to that 
these students were hardly talking 
about the hunger situation," said 
Bob Tate, a Yale speaker who visited 
Manchester. Spontaneous efforts 
have an effect. 
Most of President Ford's mail for 
the months of December and Janu-
ary concerned the world hunger situ-
ation. Approximately 90 percent fa-
vored increased U.S. relief aid. 
Organizations from all over the 
country have coordinated a Food 
Day on April17 to illustrate a new 
feeling that food, as well as oil, is a 
valuable resource. 
The Yale Hunger Action Project 
does not stand alone in its concern. 
With the proper vision Yale could 
educate scholars, trouble shooters, 
and planners in the field of hunger. 
For lawyers, this may entail chang-
ing the practices of international 
companies -lawyers can advise 
when (and for how much) a company 
should sell its foreign interests back 
to indigenous groups. People in 
multinational corporations have to 
see, and some of them do, that the 
food crisis is not an isolated pheno-
menon. The profit and progress of 
these companies come at the ex-
pense of people in developing coun-
tries. 
On a different level, a student 
could use his talents to work for 
organizations such as Oxfam or 
CARE. 
The burden of the world hunger 
problem rests not on the United 
States nor on the developing coun-
tries: it rests on everyone. Each 
nation has to produce its resources 
as effectively as possible. The United 
States, because of its technological 
and agricultural advances, can afford 
to release some of its citizens to 
coordinate efforts throughout the 
world. People must develop a world 
overview; the problem of world hun-
ger is not restricted to particular 
regions or particular people-ulti-
mately it affects everyone. 0
