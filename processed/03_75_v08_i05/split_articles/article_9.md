**Title: The Yale Hunger Action Project- Where It Stands Today**
**Author: Bob Liechty**

I don't enjoy people telling me that 
thousands of infants die every day in 
the world. I don't think I really 
believe it. Where I come from child-
ren usually live to an old age. We 
have abortions and miscarriages, but 
that's a different story. 

The question that bothers me is 
why do people starve to death? 

They don't eat enough, I know. But 
because I eat more than enough 
should I feel guilty? I don't enjoy 
feeling guilty any more than think-
ing about starving people. I feel 
guilty because people tell me that I 
am part of a system that deprives 
others of food. We have beautiful 
lawns at the expense of India not 
having enough fertilizer. Fine. I see 
the comparison but I also realize that 
the rice I leave on my plate won't 
feed a starving infant in India. 

I don't like it when guilt forces me 
to repress my better instincts-when 
I feel bad because I think that what-
ever I do will be too small. "The sad 
thing is that if one can't take a giant 
step," said William Sloane Coffin, 
the Yale Chaplain, "then one won't 
take any step at all." 

. 
The Yale Hunger Action Project 
(YHAP) has modest immediate and 
long-range proposals. They realize 
that to effect any changes one has to 
take a series of small steps.

I became aware of the YHAP in 
September when Reverend Coffin 
asked students, faculty, and admin-
istration to come to his office every 
Friday afternoon to discuss the 
hunger situation. Even though 
Coffin started the meetings, many 
different people have developed as 
leaders. Perhaps this is what has 
made the group so strong. 

The fast on November 5, 1974, was 
the first group activity. "Fasting is a 
small reflection,'' said Coffin. It gave 
the students a chance to sacrifice 
something and unified them around 
a common act. 

But if some people coalesced 
around the fast others became irri-
tated because of it. "The major oppo-
sition that I found collecting signa-
tures for the fast," said Charlie 
Homer '76, "was the reaction, 'You 
people are trying to make us feel 
guilty. I'm willing to give money but 
I'm not willing to make a committ-
ment.' I said, we appreciate your 
signing up.'' 

doesn't expect everyone to commit 
themselves to work on the Project. 
The YHAP serves its purpose if 
people become sensitive to the 
hunger situation. 

On February 27, a cQmmittee 
appointed by President Brewster 
and headed by Burke Marshall, a 
Law School professor, held their first 
open hearing to consider an official 
Yale response to world hunger. The 
YHAP formally presented their 
goals, written by David O'Connor 
'75, before this committee. The pro-
posals suggested the creation of a 
curriculum that would stress specific 
issues related to hunger: nutrition, 
world finance, agricultural advance-
ments, food distribution, and land 
reform. They suggested that the 
summer term in 1976 have as its 
axis the world hunger problem. They 
proposed that Yale encourage stud-
ents on leave of absence, about eight 
percent of the student body, to spend 
time on development projects in 
Third World countries. The YHAP 
also discussed the few graduate 
school courses offered in the area 
of world hunger. 

The YHAP suggested to the 
Marshall Committee that the dining 
halls provide students with the 
option of meatless meals and the 
choice to fast on a weekly basis and 
channel the money through the 
YHAP. They noted that fertilizer 
used on Yale lawns could be put to 
better use in India if the proper 
distribution agency were found. 

They admitted, however, that these 
last efforts were "at best stopgap 
measures." 

"Yale is inherantly political," the 
YHAP representative reminded the 
committee. He cited the political im-
plications involved with Yale's in-
vestments in international corpora-
tions. 

A wide range of groups besides 
· the YHAP spoke before the com-
mittee, underlining the broad con-
cern with world hunger. ECHOE, a 
Boston-based group representing 
universities, ecological groups, bus-
inesses, and private citizens, solicited 
Yale's support. Chuck Powers, a 
professor at the Yale Divinity 
School, spoke on the ethics of relief. 
!\nother group advocated reforms in 
Connecticut's school lunch program. 
Alan Berg, author of The Nutri-
tkm Factor, who spoke at Yale 
earlier this year, wrote a letter to the 
Marshall Committee saying that he 
was impressed by what he saw and 
hoped that this interest would push 
Yale graduates into professional 
fields they had conspicuously 
avoided. 

Albert Dobie, head of Yale Dining 
Hall services, submitted a letter of 
support for meatless alternatives. 
He. opposed a move to force veg-
etarian meals on students but said 
he would cooperate with efforts to 
raise funds through dining hall acti-
vities. Dobie was impressed with the 
honesty of students during the Nov-
ember 5 fast. "In fact," he said, 
"more people fasted than signed up. 
Students have changed from 
previous years." 

"I've gotten calls from literally 
every part of the country asking 
what we're doing here," Dobie 
added. He doesn't think that fasting 
is a fad-rather, it reflects a concern 
spontaneously developed in various 
colleges-one that "will be here to 
stay." 

But Dobie recognizes that the 
dining halls' greatest effect comes 
from educating the students. If stu-
dents learn to eat better-waste less 
food, stop overeating, and use less 
meat (which releases grains 
consumed by cattle for human use)-
then the dining halls will have a 
lasting effect on a student's life.

The Marshall Committee hearing 
provided a forum to air positions 
and opinions of various groups, but 
the work and planning occurred else-
where.

The YHAP divided itself into five 
sub-committees to investigate an 
inter-college network, an intra-
college organization, research, 
speakers, and long-range planning. 
The intra-college task force, 
headed by Pam Kohlberg '75, 
conducted the "Catalytic Dollar for 
Education" canvass, instituted 
recycling programs, and organized 
three Monday night fasts during 
March. As the residential colleges 
realized their potential they asked 
groups, such as the Free Food Coun-
cil of New Haven, to assign parti-
cular colleges a specific relief pro-
gram within New Haven. 

The task force contacted the Yale 
Daily News and the New Haven 
J oumal-Courier and asked them to 
run a "neediest cases" series like 
the series in the New York Times. 
The YHAP realized that relief 
money does make a difference and 
that their efforts could change the 
attitude of students. But they also 
saw, as did Boyce Rensberger in the 
New York Times, "that the limiting 
factor is the strength and will of 
leaders in government and finance to 
make food production and distri-
bution matters of high national and 
international priorities." Therefore, 
the YHAP conducted a letter 
writing campaign to begin the slow 
process of influencing politicians. 

A second group in the YHAP 
began to coordinate Yale's activities 
with those of other universities. 
Headed by Stefan Pressor '76, and 
Bob Tate, an assistant chaplain, this 
group sent fact sheets, position 
papers, and bibliographies to 250 
major universities. They now have a 
mailing list of 100 schools that 
exchange information and ideas. In 
an effort to organize Northeastern 
colleges into a coherent political base 
students from Tufts, Harvard, and 
Yale called colleges to a meeting in 
Boston on February 15. Thirty col-
leges formed the Northeast Hunger 
Action Alliance (NEHAA) and 
pledged to inform each other of ideas 
developed at their respective col-
leges. 

The NEHAA met in New Haven on 
March 15 and passed the following 
positions regarding "Food Day," 
planned for April 17. 

1- Every individual has the 
Right to a proper diet and ade-
quate food supply. 

2- Corporate policy and wasteful 
consumption habits can not be 
allowed to violate this Right. 

3- To insure this Right, the 
world's existing resources must be 
distributed more equally.lf so dis-
tributed, the world's resources can 
feed everybody. Historically, pop-
ulation growth stabilizes with 
social equality, economic develop-
ment, and adequate food supply. 

4- The world hunger problem is a 
matter of justice and not charity. 
· Food must not be used as a poli-
cal weapon. 

5- We recognise that the food 
crisis is not an isolated phenome-
non but one manifestation of a 
pattern of gross inequality in the 
distribution of wealth, both within 
nations and between nations. 

The YHAP sponsored a series of 
speakers at Yale who exposed stu-
dents to current thoughts and the-
ories about the hunger problem. 
Five speakers have already visited 
and the sixth, Brad Morse, Under 
Secretary-General of the United 
Nations will speak in March.

To date, the YHAP has collected 
just under $15,000 through fasts and 
private contributions. The fast in 
November amassed $7,173 and the 
three fasts during March will net 
$3,100. 

Each student who fasted on 
November 5 designated where he or 
she wanted the rebate to go. AFRO, 
a Yale group, received $2,941 
and sent the money to the Inter-
state Committee for Relief in the 
Sahel-a U.N. food relief project. 

The Free Food Council in New 
Haven distributed $2,291 worth 
of food to people who couldn't 
pay for both heat and food. The 
Bible Medical Society transfered the 
remaining $1,941 for food and 
medical aid in Bangladesh. 

The YHAP donated the $3,100 
collected in the March fasts to 
the Free Food Council. Early in the 
winter, FFC received hundreds of 
calls a week for food but had none 
to distribute. True, the money sent 
to people in New Haven didn't go to 
people dying in Africa, but it did aid 
many who might develop eye 
diseases and other ailments resulting 
from deficient diets. "Besides," added 
Coffin, "one doesn't have to apolo-
gize for small acts of mercy." 

Four groups compose the Free 
Food Council: Christian Union, 
which serves the area behind Payne-
Whitney gymnasium, Christian 
Community Action, which works in 
the Hill neighborhood near the Yale-
New Haven Hospital, Fairhaven 
Ministry, which is located ten miles 
northeast of Yale, and Fish, which 
has no neighborhood center but de-
livers food to the homes of people 
in emergency situations- such as 
people who have been mugged or had 
their rent, utilities, or fuel rates 
raised beyond their means. 

Christian Community Action fed 
over 150 families in January, not on 
a full time basis but only when the 
families couldn't last on their insuf-
ficient welfare checks. 

Fish delivered meals to 1,300 
people- or about 260 families - in 
January. In September when the 
heating bill was lower and inflation 
less severe, they fed only 76 families. 

"Connecticut is a wealthy state," 
said Bob Martin, the only paid per-
son in Fish, a group maintained by 
200 volunteers. "But the welfare 
system is screwed to begin with. 
And this winter was bad."

"For instance," added David 
Nehring from the Christian Com-
munity Action group, "if a person 
only has $45 yet has a certificate 
from the State to let him buy 
$50 of food stamps he can't 
buy any stamps unless he has 
the whole $50. That's where we 
help." 

And there were other sources of 
money besides the fast. When Tom 
W eiskel, a Yale English professor, 
died on December 1 the family asked 
for contributions to hunger relief-
instead of flowers - to commemorate 
Mr. Weiskel's life. These people 
donated $1,100. 

The Symphony Orchestra, 
Russian Chorus, Yale Band, and 
people interested in Jazz volunteered 
concerts to publicize the YHAP and 
raise money. 

On his own initiative John Espy 
'76, collected books and asked Mr. 
Whitlock, of Whitlock Books on 
Broadway Avenue, to sell them. Mr. 
Whitlock agreed if Espy would price 
the books so that the project would 
stay in the hands of students. Prices 
ranged from ten cents to a few dol-
lars. Books came from solicitations 
at Dwight Hall, Battell Chapel, and 
the sign in front of the boo!t store. 

"I had never thought of this," 
said Mr. Whitlock. "From the end of 
November to February 8 we earned 
$1,062.33. It seems that we've 
got a sure-fire formula to raise 
money for whatever you want."
