Blue Butterflies with Razor Beaks 
by JohnS. Rosenberg 
Here at the New Yorker, by Brendan 
Gill. Random House. $12.95 
"My intention is to follow the prin-
ciple upon which the 'Talk of the 
Town' department of the magazine is 
based: I will try to cram these para-
graphs full of facts and give them a 
weight and shape no greater than 
that of a cloud of blue butterflies." 

An admirably lucid statement of pur-
pose, and no wonder: for the subject 
of this book is The New Yorker, a 
magazine we admire for its precise 
and vigorous writing; and its author 
is Brendan Gill, a "lifer" at the mag-
azine, who through his millions of 
words has contributed much toward 
bringing it to excellence. The book is 
his present to the magazine on its 
fiftieth birthday. 

Yet Gill is disingenuous, even 
wicked. For Here at The New Yorker 
presents not the whole of the maga-
zine, but only its past, on which our 
parents and professors cut their 
teeth. The magazine's past stands to 
its present as the Yale of Brendan 
Gill's college years is to Yale today: 
behind the aristocratic facade and 
posturing of each institution lay 
much unhappiness and cruelty. 

Today the magazine's reporters dis-
sect much that is cruel in our society, 
just as the current Yale questions 
the presumptions of many of its 
graduates. Though dressing it up, 
Gill opens the magazine's past to the 
same treatment. Those leisurely 
swarms of blue butterflies conceal 
razor beaks and sharp talons. 

Brendan Gill, by his account, 
leads-and always has led-an 
almost insufferably happy life. It is 
this which so marks him from his 
colleagues at The New Yorker. 
"Happy writers have histories short-
er even than happy families," Gill 
writes. In his case this is true 
because of his demonstrable happi-
ness; but too many of his colleagues 
lived terribly short lives, mostly 
without any happiness at all. The 
magazine is wise to protect its stars 
from the public eye, for they are a 
wretched lot of misfits; now that Gill 
has by his zeal interrupted their 
"daily naps," we are forced to pick 
through the laundry, trying to match 
these maimed people to the brilliance 
of their clothes. 

Gill's youth fit nicely the purposes 
of the magazine under its founder, 
Harold Wallace Ross. The New 
Yorker was to be a journal for 
dandies, dedicated to the night club 
life of the 1920's. Ross, a comfortable 
bigot, thirsted for facts, for style, for 
graceful cocktail chatter. Upon dis-
covering that the Vienna phone com-
pany played an "A" for its custom-
ers who wanted to tune their instru-
ments, Ross assigned a reporter to 
call the number overseas, and to 
write it up. Brilliant reporting, about 
trifles. In a New Yorker this Febru-
ary, some other faceless writer called 
up the New York Times' computer 
typesetting equipment, to report on 
the sharp "F" it sang into the tele· 
phone. The more things change ... 

Gill began his career among 
writers. Pampered through baby-
hood and prep school by a rich doc-
tor father in Hartford, in the com-
pany of Wallace Stevens and Yeats, 
Gill landed at Yale. In his senior year 
he edited the centennial edition of 
the Yale Lit and was a Bones man. 
Brash, he burst out laughing when 
Robert Frost recited the word 
"bones" during a reading of "The 
Witch of Coos" in Pierson. Frost 
icily terminated his readi.ng, and his 
visit to Yale. Gill got over his embar-
rassment and finished his senior year 
easily when his English tutor blew 
his brains out. 

Undaunted by the sordidness of 
the adult world, Brendan married 
upon graduation, and his father gen-
erously set the young couple up with 
a Connecticut farm, and gave them 
a honeymoon tour of Europe, much 
of it in the company of the Yale 
Glee Club. After a performance by 
the Whiffenpoofs in Munich, "it 
appeared that Hitler had found 'To 
the Tables Down at Mory's' especial-
ly endearing, and he congratulated 
J. Merrill Knapp, the chief Whiff. 
and first editor of The New Yorker. 
"I have always held it against 
Knapp," Gill says, "that at that 
moment he didn't leap upon Der 
Fuhrer and strangle him to death 
with his bare hands, thereby, at the 
expense of a single human life-his 
own, to be sure-preventing the out-
break of the Second World War." 

This is Gill's sole political reflection 
in the book, and possibly in his life; 
significantly, Gill thinks of the epi-
sode in terms of strangling-the 
work of the hands-and never in 
terms of words or writing, his truest 
weapons against all the Hitlers in the 
world if he had cared to use them. 

Home again, in the late 1930's, 
Gill wrote up a thinly fictionalized 
account of meeting Sinclair Lewis, a 
friend from the days of compiling the 
centennial Lit, in a Hartford theater. 
The New Yorker accepted it, and its 
author joined the magazine for life, 
with only one interlude. 

What a life it has been, amidst the 
congenitally slovenly, misshapen 
offices of The New Yorker. Nothing 
was ever thrown away or cleaned up: 
painters painted around Thurber's 
graffiti on the hall walls; papers 
accumulated in offices of a galaxy of 
writers, who "tend to be lonely, 
mole-like creatures, who work in 
their own portable if not pleasant 
darkness and who seldom utter a 
sound above a groan." They whined 
and connived against one another, 
consuming themselves in jealousy, 
alcohol, and their life-long-but 
short-lived-unhappinesses. How 
they complained, from Ross angered 
about the "coons" moving near his 
country house, to Thurber, delight-
ing in making John O'Hara hate Gill 
and the magazine. Brilliance in writ-
ing, disaster in living. 

We see Shirley Jackson and her 
husband, Stanley Hyman, snuffing 
out their lives: ·having stuffed them-


selves over breakfast, they summon 
the waiter, not for a check, but to 
order the same meal all over again. 

Gill brings us a historic confronta-
tion between Edmund Wilson and 
A.J. Liebling: "Each of them liked 
to talk and each wished to talk at the 
other man but not with him. Liebling 
launched out on an extended aria, to 
which Wilson affected to listen; in 
reality, he was simply watching 
Liebling's chest and waiting for the 
moment when Liebling would have 
to stop talking in order to draw 
breath. The moment came at last, 
and Wilson leapt with a torrent of 
words into the momentary gap ... 
what made the battle all the more 
remarkable was that neither oppon· 
ent relinquished the tiniest part of 
his hold on his own topic of conver· 
sation. Wilson, who was then at the 
height of his interest in the Dead Sea 
Scrolls, roared on contentedly about 
their significance, while Liebling 
mumbled on contentedly about a 
favorite figure of his, the learned 
sportsman Colonel Stingo." 

A remarkable battle between 
titans, each phrase finely turned, 
each thought clear; but did Wilson 
and Liebling thus advance the world, 
or their own understandings, at all? 
Was there more in this thrashing and 
hacking out at each other than the 
struggle of naked intellects, too frail 
to admit the presence of another? 

William Shawn, Ross's successor 
as editor. 

Gill partied his way through his 
friends' lives of misery much as he 
must have partied at Yale, oblivious 
of the Depression outside. Yet at all 
these parties, the men and women of 
The New Yorker never broke down 
its coldness. Some members of the 
magazine worked side by side for 
years,withoutspeaking,without 
making introductions beyond a 
memorable-and, one suspects, 
hardly unique-"Fuck you!" 

How much of life Gill misses at all 
those parties! Gill dedicates his book 
to William Shawn, editor of The New 
YorkersinceJanuary 1952, soon 
after Ross's death, soon before most 
of my generation was born. "For 
more than twenty years it has been 
Shawn's fate to edit a humorous 
magazine that, holding up a mirror 
to life, everywhere reflects the dark- · 
est shadows and yet manages to 
make us laugh." Though Gill's book 
conforms to this spirit, portraying 
the miniature tragedies of his stun-
ning associates, his contribution falls 
far short of Shawn's. 

Shawn introduced significant 
intellectual content into the maga-
zine, slapping it out of the diversions 
of the 1920's. "Better than any other 
editor of our time, he has been able to 
measure the distance of our national 
fall from grace; better than any 
other, he measures today the diffi-
culty of regaining that grace." : 

Today Shawn accomplishes this 
self-appointed task with a new stable 
of writers, who make The New York-
er a political journal. It is the meas-
ure of Gill's world that he excludes 
this new generation of writers. 

Where is Richard Rovere, whose pen 
slashed Joe McCarthy? And Richard 
Harris, exposer of Congress and the 
erosion of civil liberties? What of 
Jonathan Schell and the devastated 
Vietnamese villages, and Rachel 
Carson with the ravished birds, and 
James Baldwin's ghetto? Gill knows 
Liebling the food critic, but ignores 
Liebling the press critic; he takes us 
to the race track with "Audax 
Minor," but not to City Hall with 
Andy Logan, nor down Wall Street 
with John Brooks. 

It was Shawn who persuaded Ross 
to devote an entire issue to John 
Hersey's Hiroshima. Shawn culti-
vated Thomas Whiteside's investiga-
tions of defoliants and cigarette 
advertising, and established the 
trenchant political comment which 
now begins most "Talk of the Town" 
sections. Shawn expanded the maga· 
zine so that it blends E.B. White's 
letters from Maine and Paul 
Brodeur's chronicle of asbestos-
caused cancers. He has mixed Calvin 
Trillin's comments on chili with stor-
ies of oil spills and pesticides. He has 
led and educated his readers. 

· Where was Gill? Still detached, 
reviewing movies and now the 
theater. Gill, loving Shawn too 
much, understood him and his 
work-the two are the same-too 
little. 

This delicious book- tangy and 
coy, as vibrant on every page as The 
New Yorker-is a monument to 
times past, when manners concealed 
passions. They are not the manners 
which we value today, nor which The 
New Yorker's pages have embodied 
for the past decade. Much of Gill's 
way of life is gone, and I am glad he 
so enjoyed it. I appreciate this book, 
not for the things he values, but for 
their contrast to our own beliefs-
as a fine antique. In letting us under-
stand how he has lived, Gill helps us 
to understand better-and to like-
the distance we have travelled from 
that past. How far we have come 
from those people there at The New 
Yorker.O
