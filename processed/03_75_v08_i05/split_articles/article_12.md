Only the cars on the streets, perhaps, 
offer a clue. And just as well-for 
this is where you come to forget. It is 
a place uniquely suited for people 
having affairs, for relationships that 
are frowned on by somebody else, or 
somewhere else, for partners meeting 
partners among a crowd grown 
familiar weekend after weekend. In 
the refrigerated darkness, all unions 
seem like a still shot from a long-
silent, long-forgotten movie. There is 
no eroticism, but only the extreme 
voluptuousness of relaxing the will 
and submitting oneself to a scene 
that seems already to have occurred. 
A wise man has said, "If you can't 
make it at the Snow Chicken, you 
can't make it anywhere.'' This, I 
trust, is an exaggeration. The Snow 
Chicken, is a whole world; its rule of 
ritualized flirtation is uncannily 
severe. like the sequence of events in 
a bad dream two nights running, and 
a sure shoot-down awaits anyone 
who looks strange, dances strange, 
or talks strange. On the outside, fall-
ing in love may mean finding out 
about yourself. Here, you make out 
when you're a good snow chicken. 0

**Editing my f"rrst [sex] book**
**Author: Bobbi Mark**

When women came to Yale in the fall 
of 1969, sex came out in the open. 
Sex and the Yale Student was an 
information booklet prepared in 1970 
'and put in each ensuing freshman 
packet. This year a committee of 
eleven students rewrote the 'sex 
book' and titled it Sex at Yale. Bobbi 
Mark, co-chairperson of the commit-
tee and co-editor of the book, reflects 
on the task of editing the controver-
sial guide. 

What began as a revision of Sex 
and the Yale Student became a 
major task of rewriting. We wanted 
to avoid the heterosexual bias of the 
original, so we added sections on 
masturbation and homosexuality. 
We changed the 1970 categories of 
Male and Female contraception into 
sections on prescription and non-
prescription methods of contracep-
tion. 

Before we began to write we met 
with our medical advisor, Dr. Phillip 
Sarrel, a gynecologist-obstetrician 
and sex counselor at Yale's Health 
Service. We were astonished at how 
much had changed in the past four 
years: the Pill is no longer a wonder 
drug, IUD's are now safe for women 
who have never been pregnant, new 
pregnancy tests have been devel-
no<'d. and million~ of men have had 
vasectomies. 

Editing copy proved exhausting. 
We preferred to write in the active 
tense, but often found this impos-
sible. The sections on contraception 
were especially difficult, because we 
·were describing passive devices used 
by active people. 

We were surprised by more subtle 
flaws. Many sections used second 
person address: "If you forget to 
take your pill," "If you think you are 
pregnant." The language assumes 
readers to be heterosexual and 
female. The editors spent one hor-
rible night changing "you" to "he or 
she" and "your" to "her or his," 
making the book more impersonal, 
but more objective. 

Extended objectivity made us 
giddy. Simple situations became 
ridiculous. For example, "If your 
condom has burst ... " A woman may 
feel this doesn't apply to her, that 
the clause should be read "If a man 
thinks his ... '' The condom then 
becomes the responsibility of the 
man, and not the couple. Using 
"your" (in the plural sense) would 
rectify this, but might offend those 
who don't use condoms. "If the con-
dom bursts" avoids confusion and 
places blame on the device or its 
inspector. 

We resolved to omit all references 
to promiscuity and were successful, 
except in the section on homosexual-
ity. There we discuss promiscuity 
and fidelity, things never mentioned 
elsewhere in the book. Had any 
homosexual served on the commit-
tee, I suspect this moralizing would 
have been detected. 

The preface and introduction to 
the book establish an attitude 
toward sex, and give meaning to the 
data which follows. The book 
emphasizes that fulfillment of this 
fundamental human need can be 
highly rewarding. 

Sex is a much discussed, often 
practiced and too often confusing 
issue at Yale. For many students, 
their time at Yale is significant in 
their. development as sexual 
beings. Freshmen faced with the 
newness and strangeness of col-
lege life, also find themselves pres-
sured into confronting sexual 
decisions. People in every class 
find that interpersonal relation-
-. hips ar(' affected by the Yale sit-
uat ion h~ · ov('n·rowding. acedemic 
pressure, the male-female ratio, 
dorm living, and dining hall 
eating. Many Yalies claim that 
there is too much sex on campus, 
others say there is too little. Some 
say nothing. Most feel very con-
fused. 

We, the authors of this book, 
are typical of Yale students in that 
we, too, have questions. It would 
be nice if the book had the 
answers. Of course it doesn't. But, 
we hope that by writing this book 
and sponsoring the sexuality 
course, we can bring some of the 
issues into the open and help 
people to share feelings, problems, 
and pleasures with others.

never seen an erect penis and to men 
and women who have never seen a 
woman's external sexual organs. 

Dr. Sarrel also thought that the 
pictures were educational. However, 
he voted against them because he 
felt they might upset some students 
and shock some alumni. Both were 
valid objections. But the pictures 
manifest the openess advocated in 
the book. We were trying to dispel, 
not perpetuate, ignorance and myth. 

For weeks we explored the pros 
and cons of using the pictures. A 
large majority of the committee 
always voted in favor of the photo-
graphs. Yet many "yes" votes were 
uncertain. We had nothing concrete 
on which to base our predictions of 
how the pictures would be accepted. 

Very few sex manuals have been 
printed and none contain photo-
graphs of sex organs. The committee 
that wrote Sex and the Yale Student 
gambled by publishing the book. 
Four years later, we felt that we were 
taking a comparable risk. 

During the debate, numerous out-
siders became involved-the printer, 
members of the Yale administration, 
doctors at the health center, lawyers, 
reporters and editors of The New 
York Times. This exaggerated the 
importance of the pictures. The 
members of the committee who were 
vehement about keeping the pictures 
fought for something more than the 
photographs. We upheld the prin-
ciples stressed in the book. Indirect-
The original pamphlet contained 
ly we promoted the equality of 
small photographs of contraceptive 
women. Most objections involved 
devices and stone sculptures. Follow-
the picture of the male. Nude photo-
ing the tone of our introduction, we 
graphs of women have always been 
decided to omit the statues and 
available and acceptable. 

The indecision proved exasperat-
ing and destructive. I felt pulled 
between my co-editor who was very 
emotional and defen~ive about the 
pictures, and other people (whom I 
respected) who were against using 
them. I was numb-almost indiffer-
ent-from months of talking and 
writing about sex and the clinical 
and unemotional aspects of birth 
control and anatomy. It became clear 
that making a decision was more 
important than what that decision 
was. We decided to use the pictures. 

As editors, we were tired of taking 
everyone's opinion into considers-
tion when the decision and respon-
sibility for it belonged to us. We 
began to anticipate that other people 
would be irresponsible or inefficient; 
and the committee reprimanded us 
for not delegating authority. But the 
demands of an editor are not those of 
a chairman. We were working on a 
project with deadlines that had to be 
met. When the book was finished we 
were all exhausted, but grudgingly 
proud. The warmth and honesty we 
began with were in the text. And 
next year's freshman will have a 
better idea of what "Sex at Yale" is, 
or should be. 0
