"Yes," he says and looks away from the room, 
away from our table into the shadows. "You can 
do two things in photography. There are those 
who would make a certain sense of what's real. 
Others prefer to make their own 'reality.' I'm more 
interested in actual things, making something 
out of what is already there. We all have to work 
with our own ideas, so in a sense we are all 
doing the same thing. But it's a question of trying 
to describe or trying to editorialize, of making 
little or much of the fact that subjectivity traps 
us all. 


Weegee, a photographer for the New York 
Daily News made a book called The Naked City. 
He was a police photographer and lived a long 
time in a furnished room right across from the sta-
tion. He had a radio set and heard the calls as they 
came in to the desk. He was his own dispatcher, 
going straight to the action. His photographs 
were organized according to category-Fires, 
Murders, Public Events-they weren't fancy pic-
tures. They were straightforward and at the same 
time infused with his own peculiar way of seeing 
things." Jerry's face lights up. On h.\s grave 
mouth a smile glimmers. "For instance, there's a 
picture of a building on fire. It's a full shot; you 
can see the jets of water spraying into the smoke. 
Clouds of steam obscure all but one sentence of a 
billboard mounted on the side of the building that 
says "Just add boiling water." We are laughing 
pretty hard, imagining a building so helpfully 
arranged for W eegee as he turned the corner. 
Jerry continues, "And another page was a picture 
of a blank piece of film, exposed to light and devel-
oped.'' He draws an imaginary rectangle on the 
table. "The caption reads 'This is a picture of 
Greenwich Village. It is blank because nothing 
ever happens there. On another page is a copy of 
a receipt that reads 'Two Murders-$35,' You see, 
he has taken two assigned pictures of murders for 
the News.' But the choice of such an artifact 
as part of his book shows a very precise sensibil-
ity. It's obvious he could immediately register and 
record his response to such an odd paycheck. His 
mind must have worked the way his camera 
works. "There is a very famous picture of him, 
sitting on a camp stool, typing on a machine in 
the trunk of his car, with big cameras all around 
~feet. He used to type the captions for the 
photographs before they went back to the News." 


We compare ideas about other workers and 
their vision, adducing an image, picturing the 
same picture. But he comes back to himself, 
weighing words carefully, regulating the openness 
of his eyes. They don't let too much in, he doesn't 
let too much out. His words are southern accented 
and softly spoken. The voiced opinions are clear 
and thought out, ready to be aired. My prepared 
questions have been anticipated, answered, some-
times dodged, all while I listen. This is nothing 
like an interview. Imagine instead sitting while 
the sun goes down, saying what one thinks and 
dreams, aloud and unabashed. 


After a moment, Jerry says to me, "It's neces-
sary to step back to see things. Good photography 
requires a certain amount of detachment. Now 
Yale is even offering a course-Alienation-pass 
it and you are an artist. You know-A&A-the 
Alienation and Architecture building. But that's 
putting the cart before the horse. By affecting 
a way of doing things you can't have the attitude 
that leads to the routine. And you can't make 
yourself be something you're not. With a Hercu-
lean effort you could keep it up for six months or a 
year, or even five years, which isn't very long 
when you consider how long we have to live. But 
to keep on doing that thing for 30 years or 50 
years, if you're not made to do it, would be impos-
sible. In the end you're going to be a business man 
if that's what you are to be. 


"I didn't start to make photographs seriously 
till my last year in college. Then when things 
weren't going well, I'd go into the darkroom, as an 
escape. When I went to graduate school the dark-
room came East with me and I found myself split-
ting time evenly between photography and study. 
I left school to teach in New York. I walked 
around a lot, looking at people, and took my cam-
era along. That's when I began to save negatives, 
to look at my work. Three years later I came 
here." 


A thought comes to mind. "Photographs are 
very powerful things," I say. "I've seen people 
react very strongly towards them. When I went 
south to Mexico the Indians wouldn't let their pic-
tures be taken. They were afraid the camera would 
steal their soul. When I look at some photographs, 
1 can't help but agree with those Indians. It is 
strange to look at faces that are no longer living, 
that have no names. The artifact, or image has 
lasted longer than the original. I've heard people 
make a point about Atget and Paris, for example. 
The world he photographed was vanishing. And 
you photographed the New Haven train station, 
which is also gone. Does it matter that your 
images are the only things that remain?" 


"I don't think so. That kind of nostalgic mean-
ing only comes atter tne ongma1 has vanished. We 
now have a special perspective on old pictures, 
knowing that such a world was about to dis-
appear, but I think it's artificial to impose such a 
perspective on the photographer. He wasn't 
necessarily conscious of tha, while it was happen-
ing. Now if I were to go out and purposefully pho-
tograph 1950 automobiles, that's something else 
again. I'm much more interested in why I photo-
graph you now. Why do I make a two dimensional 
image of someone who will still be here tomorrow. 
I make something new. I make a photograph.
