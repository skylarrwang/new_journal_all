I wonder why anybody goes to the Snow Chicken Cafe. What peculiar pleasure can be obtained there? Certainly nothing could be less erotic. Yet on a Friday night, the Fords, Chevys, and Dodges are parked about a block and a half deep on each of five deserted streets adjacent to that white cinderblock box with the purple awning.


Standing discreetly before the entrance is a bouncer He will remind anybody flagrantly in violation of the "dress code" advertised by the establishment that they had better return more suitably attired. Just inside the door the management has posted t'he rather elaborate code. It prohibits, among other things, jeans and workboots, and requires jackets and collared shirts.


No need for the sign: everyone is dressed to the hilt. Standing on line, I feel a bit out of place in my Mory's tie and jacket, but a part of me has roots here, via Brooklyn and what I know to be Coney Island Avenue chic. Most of the guys are dressed toward the flashier end of the Brass Button spectrum, parading rich in gaudy patterned shirts, platform shoes, and crotch-tight pants. The dolls display themselves in outline-pants, lots of makeup, and revealing halter-tops. The line is jittery and talkative, but no one says a word about the $2 cover for a place that doesn't even feature alive band. To complain would be decidedly incorrect considering the exaggerated politesse and air of affected refinement that prevails inside the joint.


Past the entrance, in a small lobby, stands the Snow Chicken emblem, mascot or totem. One has ample time to admire it during the wait to be seated. It is a large, grotesque, papier-mache sculpture of a fat hen with protuberant breasts and ass, a cross between a woman and a beast. As a product of the human imagination, it is akin to the figure of the unicorn: a fantastic being which does not really exist in the world, but which embodies a conglomerate of certain elements that exist in strange togetherness here in this hyperventilated coop. Yet only in retrospect, as one walks out the door, does the justness of the sculpture's epitomization become fully apparent. Like the coat of arms of an entire age, it proclaims the ethos of the place: a mixture of mindless "culture in pure sensation," with a cowardly lust for plasticene regularity of desirable features, a doll-like cosmeticism that never grows old. No tit will do here without its wad of silicone.


In unctuous accents, the host introduces himself and leads you into the enormous dancing and sitting area, constructed slopingly and in the round, so that the focus is on the dance floor below. There are two long mirrored bars, and in the dark, what seems to be over a hundred white plastic-wood tables. The dance floor is brilliantly lit, relatively small and extremely crowded. The overpowering sound system and jerky strobe lights are intended to blow the mind, and to produce the effect of having entered another world. On the circular ceiling, the same white material used for the tables is shaped to mimic the vines and branches of a belated, DuPontized bower of bliss.


Every few seconds, shrill police whistles punctuate the long soul records, sounds of the dancers advertising for themselves. When the music stops, fluttering bird noises lead some of them back to their nests.


Everything at the Snow Chicken tends to blur distinctions. The crazy lights and look-alike dress make it impossible to tell how rich or poor any of the people are, or to guess at what they might do on the outside.
