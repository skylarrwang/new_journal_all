The NewJoumal I March 26, 1975

The State Fair was held every year 
in Dallas during the last weeks in 
October. It was billed as "The State 
Fair of Texas, The Biggest State 
Fair in the World." We always went 
to it because there was always a Fair 
Day, a day when our school let us off 
and gave each of us a ticket to get 
through the gates. It was at the fair 
that I experienced in its totality the 
confusing cacophony of Texas: its 
wind-roughened farmers looking 
over new harvesters; its bow-legged 
cowboys dangling rolled cigarettes 
from their lips; the rich cattlemen 
dressed in embroidered boots and 
shirts (with pearl snap buttons), usu-
ally looking over mountainous prize 
bulls named Little Boy, Big John, or 
Sonny Sam; and the negroes, or as 
they were called earlier, the colored 
folks, dressed either in subdued, 
earthy colors with straw hats, or in 
maroons and golds, ogling the new 
cars in the Automobile Building. Or 
sometimes you would find them at 
the Wildlife Building where there 
was a shallow pool filled with cat-
fish, perch, and bream. If you paid 
twenty-five cents you could fish in it 
for three minutes with bamboo poles. 
Every now and then somebody 
would whoop with delight after catch-
ing his Sunday dinner. I spent 
enough quarters to fill up Turtle 
Creek, but I never had a nibble. 


There were penny arcades with 
pinball machines and teenaged 
hustlers. There were cotton candy 
stands, pecan pie booths, Dr. Pepper 
and Frito carts-all of them sur-
rounded by masses of children, every 
fourth one crying. But the best part 
of the fair, the most crowded and 
most fun, was the Midway. Barkers 
with home-fried accents would get 
you to put down a quarter on the 
spinning wheel, or pitch three base-
balls at weighted bowling pins, or 
show your strength by swinging a 
sledge ~1ammer and ringing a bell. 
And, of course, there were the freak 
shows where for a slim dime you 
could see the bearded lady, a horse 
smaller than a dog, a dog with five 
legs, and Siamese twins. There was 
something scary and fetid about the 
side shows and sometimes I would 
skip them altogether. But if one of 
my friends boasted that he was 
going there, all of us kids would fall 
in line behind the over-ailed farmers 
chewing straws, pay our dimes and 
walk in. If we hadn't, we'd have been 
called chickens for the next two 
weeks. 


This conglomeration of people was 
Texas in the late fifties and early six-
ties. Every part and type of Texas 
was represented. The hicks rubbed 
against the city folk, the cowboys 
against the oilmen, the colored 
against the white, all proud to be 
there, to be a part of Texas for those 
two weeks. And when it finished 
they would all return to their respec-
tive places: the cowboys back to the 
Staked Plains, the oilmen to their 
office buildings, the blacks and Mex-
icans to their shacks, the whites to 
their stone and brick houses, and the 
barriers between them would seem 
impregnable for another year. 


At the entrance and exit to the fair 
stood Big Tex, a four-story, blue-
jeaned cowboy with a huge Stetson 
on his head and with a deep, slow 
recorded voice that broadcast pleas-
antries and messages. Sometimes his 
mechanical insides would get out of 
synch and his mouth would flap open 
and shut a few times and then shut 
for good as a booming soliloquy 
emerged, sounding like the voice of 
God gushing from the heavens. If 
any of us ever got lost or separated 
from the group, we'd always meet 
back at Big Tex. Because of his 
voice, his height, his bigness, I was 
never too far away from his presence. 
Without rambling into the obvious, 
without expounding what Big Tex 
symbolizes for me even today, it is 
enough to know that he'd always 
manage to belch while I was leaving: 
" Y'all come back, ya heah." 


We were deeply aware of Texas 
history while growing up, and the 
War for Independence inspired many 
monuments. There was the Alamo 
for one, and by the time we reached 
high school, we had all traveled with 
one class or another to San Antonio 
to see it. When I was about six years 
old, every kid on the block had a 
coonskin hat and a rifle named 
Betsy. We all died imaginary deaths, 
surrounded by hundreds of dead 
Mexicans. Santa Anna, the Mexican 
general, was always portrayed as a 
fat, lazy fool who let his whole army 
get surrounded during a siesta by a 
daring force of Texans at San 
Jacinto. The monument to commem-
orate that victory is the exact height 
of the Washington Monument, but 
the state government put a star on 
top to make the San Jacinto obelisk 
a little bit taller. 


Along with my pride in Texas, I 
was constantly reminded of my fam-
ily's role in Texas history. My great-
great grandfather, Svante Magnus 
Swenson, was the first Swedish 
immigrant in Texas and best friends 
with Sam Houston. With such pres-
tigious 'political connections, Svante 
put together huge tracts ofland in 
Central Texas, which became known 
as the Swenson Land and Cattle Co., 
the second biggest ranch in the state. 
Eighty people now own it, aU des-
cended from Svante. Some of them 
are fourth cousins who live in New 
York and Boston. Others still live on 
and operate the ranch. 


Every now and then Dad would 
pack us in the station wagon, and 
drive four hours across North-Cen-
tral Texas to the ranch. Along the 
way we'd pass towns called Weather-
ford, Abilene, Stamford, and Throck-
morton. They were Southern towns, 
with an overwhelming Texan outlook 
that acknowledges no defeat, except 
when a vengeful God causes the 
crops to dry up and the land to blow 


Modern Dallas is the sophisticated 
city cousin to these prairie towns. 
During the Vietnam War it was 
harsher, less tolerant, and less for-
giving. But that's another chapter, 
describing my dealings with the 
draft board as a C.O., being rejected 
by old friends because of it, and 
turned away from old places because 
my hair was too long. But that is 
another story, one that says I can't 
go home again, at least not to the 
Dallas I knew, the one I wrote about 
here, the one I carry around inside. 0

The Images that Remain 
by Missy Panzer 
Jerry Thompson, Instructor of Photography at 
the Yale School of Art, teaches Documentary 
Photography in the graduate school. He also 
teaches introductory and studio photography to 
undergraduates. He grew up in Houston, Texas 
and attended the University of Texas and Johns 
Hopkins. He received an MFA degree from Yale. 
Jerry Thompson is slender, with thick brown 
hair already laced with silver though he is close 
to thirty. His eyes are deep brown and large. 
We walk from York Street to his studio along 
the underside of the city, past the State Street 
garage and the White Tower. In his second story 
loft, a chair against a white paper backdrop faces 
a huge box of a camera, a big, black, intimate 
monster. The rest of the room is bare. The wooden 
floor shows marks of large machines now van-
ished. Several tall narrow windows puncture the 
walls and let in the sun; it is a lazy, bright after-
noon. 


"You see," he says to me, "I'm getting stable. 
There's going to be a darkroom there." He points 
to an empty space, bordered by high shelves hold-
ing bottles of chemicals and yellow boxes of photo-
graphic paper. "The camera and lights are set up. 
I have a place to bring things." 


As yet there are very few things here. A wooden 
shelf over the radiator holds a coffee pot and thick 
china mugs. A broom stands in the corner. We sit 
on two chairs. I look out the window over his 
shoulder. He looks straight out over the horizon. 
"Do you ever think of returning to Houston?" I 
ask. 


J eny Uelsmann 
"If I did right now, it would be to photograph. 
My dream project is to capture in 30 or 60 or 75 
images, the essence of a city. And going all over 
the country, recreate in photographs what it feels 
like to be in New York, Baltimore, Houston. I 
know few cities well. But each time I go some-
where new I'm surprised to find it nothing like 
the places I have been to before. Each city has its 
own distinct feeling, that much is clear. The ques-
tion is how to get it down on film. 


Walker Evans 
Sharecropper, Alabama 1936 
"James Agee and Walker Evans captured a 
tiny comer of the South when they wrote Let Us 
Now Praise Famous Men. Evans began to do that 
for many sections of the country. Each series of 
photographs is great, but they are still incom-
plete. I'm talking about an all-inclusive piece of 
work, it would be marvelous if anyone could ever 
finish it. It would take years. It would take years 
of walking the streets." 


"I first went to Coney Island with a group ot 
kids from school. I couldn't wait to get back there, 
to see the place, to photograph." 


Jerry's photographs of people on the island are 
not meant to mirror the island. If you go there you 
won't see what is in the pictures. A photograph 
does not copy an image from real life, it shows 
what the photographer saw in a particular scene. 
Subject matter is important; it makes possible the 
communication of a certain way of seeing. And 
New York has a way of making you want to show 
the other people on the streets what you see. 


I am interested in Jerry's opinion of two men 
whose work I don't quite understand. "A photo-
graph," I begin, "is something more, something 
other than what was there at the time the photo-
graph was made. But many contemporary photog-
raphers don't stop at the enhancement of what 
you can see. They go on to make images of things 
that can't be seen at all. Duane Michals does this 
in sequences of photographs which 'tell stories.' 
Jerry Uelsmann makes prints from a combination 
of negatives to produce dream-like juxtaposed 
images.''
