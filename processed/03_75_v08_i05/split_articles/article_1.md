At first, the hints are small. They are neither boastful not blatant. Instead, they whisper in shy voice and only to those who will stop in the day pace to listen: spring nears. Perhaps for you it is the rain, which seems to soften from sleet to warm drizzle. Perhaps it is the earth aroma rising, the rich perfume of fecund loam. For you it may be that tenuous blooming blush of violet hysteria or the briefly-spied herd of geese returning to some Northern lagoon. But as child saplings from the prairie woodlands, we should look to the visit of the bearded vulture as guarantor of the vernal equinox.


How noble a specimen of bird would reward our furtive search when first we heard its haunting refrain 'round the Ides. Fidgeting, squirming children at the groaning breakfast board deep in the heartland grain belts, we would cast our tiny eyes at one another in conspiratorial glee on that morning more special to us than Christmas when the bearded vulture's song seemed to hang like the smell of ebon coffee and chum-sweet griddle cakes over the kitchen table. "Lando Goshen, Pa," Ma would exclaim, "Those tads o' yourn'r wrigglin' more furious 'n a litter o' whelps at drownin' time."


Pa could hear our hearts beat. He would scarcely glance up from his morning Agribusiness man's News Porum & Late Chicage Markets when he issued the delicious edict of release, those longed-for words to free us from the shackles of sobriety and send us into our rainbow-hued forest of fantasy. With a knowing twinkle in his one good eye, he spoke to us as if he too longed to commune with the vulture, as if he too for a daybreak's instant would return to the boyhood of like adventure: "Go on, get the hell out of here. You both make me sick. I hope your legs get torn off in a varmint trap."


And off we'd scramble, tumbling and squealing like piglets over one another in a maddened dash heart-stop, greased-lightning sweepstakes to be the first, the very first, ever-so-wonderfully first person in the whole wide world to find the mystical, mythical, Midwestern Phoenix risen in gaudy splendor from the barren cruel ashes of Winter. Diminutive Ulysses beckoned to the Sirens, we imagined phrases never really there-our ears younger then, maybe too our souls, but when the vulture called we found a message. He spoke to us as if he knew himself to be the harbinger of spring and the words were poesy divine: "Skraaaawk, frap-krak-a-rak, skraaaaawk, frap-krak-a-rak ... "
