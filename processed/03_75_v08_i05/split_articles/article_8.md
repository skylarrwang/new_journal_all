"The story of the train station pictures doesn't 
end there. The lady in charge of preserving the 
station called me up after the pictures were pub-
lished in the Yale Alumni Magazine, and said that 
the organization would like a print of the station. 
in case they ever rebuild it, they would then know 
how to proceed. They want to project a copy from 
a projection of the original. They want to make a 
projection from a projection. That's all a photo-
graph is-projection of light onto a sensitive 
surface." 

Light is reflected off disorganized space. The 
person controlling the light, by means of a camera, 
organizes the space, framing it in a certain way. I 
use my ear and pen and paper the same way Jerry 
uses a camera and light, to select an image. That 
way of framing something, or taking a picture, can 
be very individual. Someone once said Cariter 
Bresson's pictures followed him around. Maybe 
so, the way he organizes space goes with him 
wherever he goes. 

"Irving Penn came to speak to the graduate 
students," I say, "and mentioned he enjoyed 
photographing for Vogue because the.man behind 
the camera was just as important to the oroduct 
as the things in front of the camera. Do you think 
that's true?" 

Jerry nods. "It's especially true about much 
of the photography he does, which is in a studio. 
His photographs are arranged. Nothing is before 
the camera until he puts it there. Studio work is 
very similar to painting. You start with a blank 
canvas and build it up, arranging things in two 
dimensional space. 

"The photography I'm doing is of a different 
kind. I think it comes out of the portraits of 
Bellocq, or Brady. They were documentary por-
traits. 
Robert Frank Political Rally, Chicago 1956 

"I use the same kind of camera that they work 
with. It make a large negative. The prints are con-
tact prints, made by placing the negative next to 
the paper and shining a light on it. The images are 
not enlarged. 
Lee Friedlander 
New Orleans 1968 

"The camera is big and heavy. It is very ob-
vious, not the 35mm kind that hides in your hand. 
Your subject knows you are taking his picture. He 
has to stand still, because the exposures are long, 
lasting several seconds. It's different from the 
fractions of a second we are used to. 

''When I began using these cameras, I was on 
the ctetenstve. Most people were using fast lenses, 
fast film, capturing smaller and smaller slices of 
time. They considered the older methods obsolete. 
I was lucky to get this camera. I was bidding 
against someone who wanted it for a planter. 
'â€¢y oung people in the sixties began to explore 
what might be called "Frank's idiom" -looking at 
American life as frozen seconds, fleeting images 
grabbed in out-of-the-way places. Hundreds of 
photographers have taken countless numbers of 
candid pictures during the last fifteen years, so 
the idiom seems depleted to many of us. We start 
to look at today's world with old tools, and the 
result is a new idiom, different from nineteenth 
century pictures because we live in a different 
time and because the tools have been refined. 

In a few years this idiom will no doubt be depleted 
for a while, and many people will turn to some-
thing else. 

''John Szarkowski, as curator of photography 
at the Museum of Modern Art, has helped tremen-
dously in bringing nineteenth century pictures to 
light. He has educated people about that kind of 
photography. All we had seen for years was the 
35mm work of people like Cartier-Bresson, Robert 
Frank or (more recently) Lee Friedlander. Maybe 
it's time to see where we've been. 

"If you want to see how the camera works, I'd 
like to take your picture, while you're here." 

He moves to the camera as I put down my pen. 
We take our places on either side of the large 
black box. Now I can see its white glass eye, and 
wonder what I look like from the other side. On 
my left is a slice of corridor, ahead the tripod and 
flash are waiting. To my right is a blank white 
wall and in front of me, the glassy impassive stare 
of the camera. "Okay look at the camera, hold it, 
page9 
good." His hand reaches forward to close down 
the lens, the white eye grows smaller. Another 
hand slides a glass plate into place. "Look at the 
camera." The light flashes. "All right." I dip 
down my head to clear the stars from my eyes. 
When I look up, the white eye is wide and ready. 
I frown and slide down on the shiny wood chair. 
The camera shifts, I move. It moves, I move and 
look up, defiant. The flash goes, blinding and 
harsh. And again the eye faces me, open and 
inquiring, unrelenting. I forget my face and stare 
back, patiently, looking at the camera very hard. 
Hands flutter at the edge of my sight, turning hot 
bulbs and sliding film. We are conversing silently 
and intensely. "That's all." I thought his voice 
would break the spell. But as we move into the 
next room, I can't resist looking back over my 
shoulder, to see if that glass stare has followed us. 
If it did, I was too slow to see. I don't know if the 
film carried a piece of my soul away, as the Mexi-
cans believe. It has grabbed a slice of time, flat 
and focused on the film. "I'll get a print back to 
you." And I will have the slice returned, trans-
formed into something I can hold. 

I owe Jerry a different kind of transformation. 
Out of time I grab our words. They return sorted 
and shuffled into a legible document of the after-
noon. We both weld onto paper an otherwise 
transient piece of time. And somewhere it's writ-
ten that for a thousand words a picture is fair 
exchange. O
