**Title: Growing Up with Big Tex**

If you drive south from the dust of Oklahoma, or north from LBJ country, or west from New Orleans and the East Texas pine forests, or east from the cattle ranches of West Texas, you'll see it jutting out of the ground: an aluminum and glass wart on the level, green plain which surrounds it. There are no capital buildings, harbors or rivers to speak of (there is the Trinity River, but it's so low and pitiful that even Dallasites call it the Trinity Trickle). The city seems to stand in the way of railroad tracks and highways as they continue to other places. There's just no good explanation for Dallas being there. It's as if some sort of industrial spontaneous generation happened out there, ruining what would have been some beautiful farm land.


In the sixth grade we learned in our Texas history class that in 1841 a fellow named John Neely Bryan was the one who actually started Dallas. Even he didn't seem to have a good reason to live there; he must have gotten tired on his way toward somewhere else and happened to be in kind of a nice spot so he built a cabin, plotted out the land around him and sold it to other lost sojourners who had stumbled off the well-beaten trails to the south and west. The teacher couldn't explain why so many stopped right there on John Neely Bryan's land. The land was good enough but it wasn't any better or worse than any land within a hundred miles. I remember asking the teacher why so many people came to live there and all she could say was, "They figured it would be a nice place to live."


The important thing is not why it grew there, but that it grew. Eventually, the first few settlers got around to naming their collections of cabins and land after President Polk's Vice-President, a man who will be remembered only because those settlers took his name to honor their new home. And Dallas grew; by the time I entered the story in 1952, it was indeed a city.


Summer was always the dominant season, the one I think of most when looking back. It was always hot and usually humid, with a three week autumn, a three week winter, a three week spring, and the rest a summer that stretched lazily on, the days banging one after another in an endless string. The only thing that distinguished one from another was the violence of the thunderstorms. We-brothers and sisters and the trembling, wiry dog-would hide under the covers of my parents' bed. I still think those gustful rumbling nights are one reason families remain tighter in the South than in any other section of the country. The scariest time we spent huddled together was during the tornado of 1957. We had been through a lot of little tornados but this one turned the sky a color I had never seen. It killed ten people, mostly in the negro section, and we could see its angry tail trailing from the boiling clouds as it skipped over our section of town.



We lived on the outskirts of the city, and a little snake of water called Turtle Creek flowed by our house. The Creek curved and twisted within a small, twenty-foot, chalk-walled drop that contained tangled vegetation and slimy creatures you'd never expect to find in a city. The Creek was narrow enough to jump over in some places, in others it was thirty yards across.


Even under the scorching summer sun we would seldom swim because of what was hidden under the surface. One hot day two policemen came down to go fishing and ended up shooting seven cottonmouths which were sunning themselves on the banks. They brought the dead snakes to our yard and a reporter took a picture of the policemen holding them draped over a bamboo fishing pole. The next day the paper ran a story warning mothers to keep their kids away from the Creek, so we couldn't go down there until everybody forgot about it-which took about a week.


In 1957, the City of Dallas hosted the Dallas Rangers of the Texas League, one step away from the majors. One year they were a farm team for the Chicago Cubs, the next year the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Baltimore Orioles the next. Even though our allegiance to major league clubs shifted with each change in ownership, we were always partial to the Rangers. We'd go out to creaky Burnett Field -a used car lot today-and idolize the players' every move.
