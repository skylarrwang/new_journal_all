THE THEMES
A
trace of that fine com-
mencement nostalgia
would stir late on my
final night at Yale last De-
cember, but it would come at
the end of a day that seemed
more a cruel and comic finale
than a Great Beginning.
E
leven hundred portraits
and biographies are to
be found in the Senior
Classbook, maldng it a com-
prehensive chronicle of the
Class of 1975. What is more,
we've added 00 pages to the
book this year, greatly in-
creasing our total coverage
of Yale College. More than
half of the book is now fea-
ture material, which includes:
450 photographs, 25 stories
and 14 special sections.

e will never again
cla~ber over a regi-
ment of bodies in
front of Brewster's house to
proclaim women's victory at
Bladderball. We no longer
need to suspend a sheet
from the window inscribed
with "Two Thousand Female
Leaders a Year."

O
ur reaction was to re-
quest saliva tests for
half their team; we just
didn't believe that jerseys
could make that much dif-
ference. Hardly daunted, we
skated onto the ice to the
cheers of a few loyal fans
and fought our way bravely
to an 11-3 loss.

ther things about Yale,
as opposed to St Ig-
natius High, dismayed
me - such as the fact that: 1)
girls don't exactly love foot-
ball players here and 2) nei-
ther does anyone else.

ver in Dillon Fieldhouse,
tiny Milt Holt, "the
Pineapple," was putting
a lei over Pat · Mel nally's
head. In strides Ted Ken-
nedy. Light bulbs pop. And
so does just about every
blood vessel in my brain.
I
looked around, and saw
terror spread over the faces
of my fellow beer bottles.
There were screams all a-
round us. I knew we had to
get out before we were
trampled.
