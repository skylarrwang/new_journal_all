There was a shortstop named 
Angel Segui from the Dominican 
Republic. Every time he took a turn 
at bat, he would knock the clods of 
caked mud off the bottom of his 
cleats, put down the bat, make the 
sign of the cross, then spit into his 
hands. One night he hit a homer in 
the bottom of the ninth to win a close 
game against the hated Amarillo 
Raiders. The next day we had our 
YMCA organized baseball practice, 
and the first four batters went 
through Angel Segui's ritual, sign of 
the cross and all, before the dumb-
founded coach gathered his wits 
enough to yell at us, telling us to 
"cut out that malarky." 


We never beat up blacks or called 
any kids nigger where I lived 
because no blacks lived near us. We 
lived in a part of Dallas called High-
land Park and no blacks were 
allowed to live there. Of course, there 
were the maids we'd always see wait-
ing at the bus stop, or the colored 
yardmen who kept the lawns mowed 
and the bushes trimmed, or the guys 
who worked at the filling station or 
behind the counter at the ice cream 
store. But we never really lived with 
them, the black section was too far 
away. 


I think now that our parents felt 
too sophisticated to call anybody a 
nigger or to tolerate us kids doing 
that. The racism was more hidden 
and perhaps deeper because the city 
was so well segregated. The only 
time we went through the black sec-
tion was for some game or other at 
the Cotton Bowl. We would drive 
through the section-our fathers 
behinds the wheels of roomy cars-
and stare at the rows of rotten wood 
shacks with the paint chipping off, 
the dirt yards that were sometimes 
used for parking during big games; 
and the blacks would always be sit-
ting on their porches, the kids in 
bedraggled clothing, barefoot and 
grimy, the adults in old rocking 
chairs or on porch railings, holding a 
can of beer, sometimes laughing 
loudly at hidden secrets, sometimes 
just watching the parade of cars. 


Every year around Christmas-time 
there was something called The Can-
paign at school to collect canned food 
for the poor black folks in West Dal-
las. They would keep count of the 
cans you brought in and post a not-
ice announcing how many cans each 
class had accumulated. We were 
always aware that our class was 330 
cans ahead of the fifth graders and 
220 behind the third graders and so 
we'd bring in more cans. At the 
school Christmas party the head of 
the West Dallas Mission would come 
and accept the cans, thank us for the 
food we donated, and bless us for 
caring about the unfortunates of our 
great city. Some of us would look at 
the trees with the star on top and the 
pile of cans beside it and smile ben-
eficently. We were the class that had 
won on the last announcement, and 
that was what mattered. 


The Mexican-Americans were no 
better off than the blacks in Dallas. 
Their own section of town was fairly 
far away from ours, but our family 
had more contact with them than 
with the blacks. We were Catholic 
and the church we went to, Holy 
Trinity, had part of its parish in the 
Mexican section. From kindergarten 
to fourth grade I went to Sunday 
Schooland learnedthestrange 
prayers and suffered the stem, scar-
ing glares of frustrated nuns who 
were determined to save the souls of 
the damned children sitting fright-
ened at their desks. But in the fifth 
grade, some of the boys in the class 
rebelled. I would hide in the men's 
room with Manuel Dominguez, 
Pablo Romon, and Jerry Sanchez. 
After the bell had rung and the hall-
ways had cleared, instead of going 
upstairs to the classroom we would 
head out to the back alley where a 
few more had gathered, Johnny Ortiz 
and Hernando Smith~ and even 
Robert Flohr who lived near me. 
Hernando pulled out a pack of cig-
arettes and passed them around. I 
nearly got sick, both from the smoke 
and from the excitement of sinning 
right there on church property. Later 
we would go shoplift from a 7-11 
store across the street, taking candy 
and girlie magazines which we all 
looked at in wonderment, trying not 
to show our obvious curiosity, trying 
to be as cool as Cisco, who knew 
everything and already had a mus-
tache. 


These kids were different from the 
ones on my block, but I never 
thought about it until Pat Flohr, 
Robert's older brother, asked us why 
we were hanging around with those 
greasy spies. He said they were so 
greasy their tongues start slipping 
and they can't talk right. He told us 
that if we kept playing around with 
them he would tell our parents. So 
Robert and I convinced our mothers 
that we weren't going to go to Sun-
day School at all. 


One of the Catholic priests in my 
parish, Father Hubert, had been a 
priest in Chicago during the Prohibi-
tion. Because most of the mobsters 
were C~tholic, they spent a lot of 
time in his church. He was the only 
priest AI Capone would trust to hear 
his confessions, and Father Hubert 
used to joke about his unsuccessful 
efforts to save Scarface's soul Fath-
er Hubert kept a big un-lit cigar in 
his mouth all the time, except when 
he was saying Mass, and every ser-
mon started out with a joke or a par-
able about his hectic days in Chi-
cago. One sermon he usually gave 
after Christmas points out how easy 
it is to misunderstand the word of 
God. Father Hubert told us that he 
had overheard a gangster trying to 
describe to some children the story of 
Joseph's flight into Egypt. The 
gangster had proclaimed excitedly, 
"Joseph picks up his wife Mary, the 
Babe Jesus, and flees.' ' One of the 
kids asked the gangster if Joseph 
scratched himself a lot like dogs with 
fleas, and he realized his mistake. 
Later, on that strange day in Novem-
ber, Father Hubert administered last 
rites to a brief, happy time of hope, 
when he annointed the shattered 
head of John F. Kennedy at Park-
land Hospital.
