Union Strife·-A Yale Tradition

T
his January, Yale will likely continue its unhappy 
tradJtion of labor dJscord. Yale and Local unions 34 
and 35 last sat at the bargaining table in September 
1988. In stark contraSt to 1984's year-long strike, adminis-
trators and workers agreed to a contract in four months of 
talks. This time the unions may have a third partner. Led by 
the Graduate Employment and Student Organization 
(GESO), Yale's graduate students are attempting to orga-
nize, with full support from the unions. "The only way to 
deal with Yale is through organizations," said Lucille 
Dickess, current president of Local 34 and an administra-
tive assistant in the Geology Department. "And three are 
better than one." 

For the unions, past experience proves that success lies 
in solidarity. Since 1968 Yale has suffered from the most 
turbulent labor history in the Ivy League. Local 35, which 
represents Yale's mostly male custodial, janitorial, and main-
tenance staff, struck repeatedly in the 1970s. Labor strife 
reached a fever pitch in 1984, when Yale's clerical and tech-
nical workers organized into Local 34. Members of the new 
union, 85 percent of whom were women, claimed Yale's pay 
rates reflected a gender discrepancy of 59 cents to the dollar. 
When the clerical and technical workers walked out 
over the issue of equal pay, Local 35 joined them. "The uni-
versity didn't believe that the men would support us, but 
they were wrong," said Dickess. "We work with each other 
very closely, and in 1988 we broke the strike pattern by sit-
ting down with Yale together and winning a decent con-
tract." 

A growing number of graduate students hope to follow 
in 34's footsteps. GESO made the first move towards form-
ing a union when they joined Yale's Federation of University 
Employees. The fledgling union launched a membership 
pledge drive this fall but so far has not enlisted a majority 
of Yale's graduate students. GESO opposes the Kagan-
Pollitt plan, which requires Ph.D. candidates to complete 
their degrees in six years and has cut 20 percent of teaching 
fellow positions over this year and next. In addJtion, gradu-
ate student health care fees rose 45 percent this year, which 
means that some TAs pay one-third of their salaries for 
health insurance. 

"We want a contract with the university in January," 
said GESO spokesperson Gordon Lafer (GRD '94). "We've 
spent years talcing part in study groups and making reports, 
and we've come to the conclusion that the cuts won't stop

unless we come together and force the issue." While some 
grad students fear the new union will force an agenda upon 
them, GESO's leaders believe their constituency supports 
them. Locals 34 and 35 have donated office space and 
management tips to GESO, and together the three groups 
hold rallies to protest university policies. 

According to the university, GESO complaints lack real 
basis. Yale claims that graduate-program costs top the list of 
fastest-rising items on the budget. "The Kagan-Pollitt plan 
did not reduce the money for grad students. The amount

lost in salaries, and more, has gone to pay for fifth- and 
sixth-year dissertation fellowships," said Charles Long, a 
deputy provost. In order to save money, the university plans 
co accept fewer grad students and require them to graduate 
faster. "Right now, we have more Ph.D. candJdates than we 
need or car;t afford," Long said. 

Even if GESO's complaints hold water, administrators 
believe that graduate students do not have the right to form 
unions. Yale's main labor negotiator Peter Vallone claims 
they receive teaching stipends as part of their scholarships, 
not as salaries. Because Yale does not define them as 
employees, the grad students cannot legally unionize with-
out university recognition. "The university will not sit 
down to discuss compensation, hours, and conditions of 
work with any group of graduate students," said Vallone. 
"Nor will we extend voluntary recognition to them. This 
could become a legal issue, and because we have a very 
strong case I believe we'd prevail." 

But GESO believes that if graduate students unite, the 
university will have to acknowledge them. "Yale defines 
itself as a community based around the common pursuit of 
study, not as a factory," said Lafer. "It will be very difficult 
for them to tell us, 'Shut up, we're not going to deal with 
you,' regardless of what the law says." 

Both GESO and the unions resent what they call Yale's 
"high-handed" approach to problem-solving as much as 
they do its specific policies. The organizations found espe-
