from whites in New Haven's Italian and Irish neighbor-
hoods-many of whom fear that blacks have taken over 
"their" cicy. "Einhorn has made this a racial campaign," said 
Alderwoman Toni Harp (D-2). "He only serves one part of 
the community .. If he wins, Dixwell and the Hill can look 
forward to benign neglect, if not conscious contempt." 


n 1990, the U.S. census reported that for the first time 
whites no longer formed a decisive majority in New 
Haven. While they still comprise 54 percent of the total 
population, blacks now make up 36 percent and Latinos at 
least 13 percent. "It's a time of racial change in the city, and 
to every action there is a reaction," said Alderman Mike 
Morand (D-1, DIY '92). "Einhorn appeals to Wesrville, 
Wooster Square and East Shore-the areas of New Haven 
with the lowest concentration of minorities." 


When Einhorn announced his candidacy in April, he 
spoke before an almost entirely white crowd. At the 
announcement speech, Joel Schiavone, then Republican 
Town Chair, told reporters that Daniels had purged all 
whites from top city jobs. "He's focused almost single-
mindedly on blacks," Schiavone told the N~w Haven 
Regisw. "He has not opened up to people of all shapes and 
sizes." 


Schiavone has since left the campaign, but allegations 
of racism have dogged Einhorn ever since. Critics claim 
Einhorn's speeches about crime and scattered-site housing 
promote fears of violent blacks in the inner city. "He's play-
ing on race very slickly," said Paul Bass OE '82), editor-in-
chief of the N~ Havm Advocau. "He hasn't come out and 
said 'nigger,' but he knows that wouldn't work." 


Einhorn persistently denies that he plays racial politics. 
In fact, he denies that racism affects New Haven society at 
all. "I honestly believe that racism is not a problem in New 
Haven," he said. "The city is ethnically diverse and poor, 
but that doesn't mean that it's racist." Alderman Chris De 
Pi no (R-18) complains that opponents have tagged Einhorn 
as racist merely because he told the truth about the Daniels

Mayor john Dani~ls struggles to hold th~ ~dg~ until Nov~mbn: 
administration. "When you raise a competency question 
about someone, and you're white and he's black, you're 
called racist," De Pino said. "Racism is ugly, but it's also a 
buzzword for journalists and the liberal media. It makes a 
nice soundbite. Ninety-nine percent of the time, there's no 
basis for it." 


In response, Morand and others point to the residential 
and educational segregation that still exist in New Haven; 
the East Shore neighborhood is 98 percent white, Hillhouse 
High School 98 percent black. They claim that at a recent 
Housing Authority meeting where hundreds of angry 
whites protested scattered-site housing, some screamed out 
remarks like, "Have you ever seen a white drug dealer?" "I 
can't believe Einhorn can say there's no racism in New 
Haven,'' said Joshua Karlin, Daniel's campaign spokesper-
son. "How can you expect him to be sensitive to other races, 
to promote multiculturalism?" 


Einhorn does have some minority support. The Puerto 
Rican Action Committee recently endorsed his candidacy, 
as have a few black Republicans like Brian Anderson. But 
by and large Einhorn's constituents live in New Haven's eth-
nic white neighborhoods. These voters feel the city has 
devoted resources primarily to poor black neighborhoods at 
the expense of others. Einhorn plays on their suspicions that 
Daniels ignores a large chunk of the city-not just middle-

class white enclaves like East Shore, 
but also racially mixed, poorer areas 
like Fair Haven. 


Alderwoman Harp, who is black, 
believes that minorities will lose out 
under an Einhorn administration. 
"Einhorn has blinders on; he doesn't 
see blacks and Latinos," she said. "He 
sees New Haven as Westville and the 
East Shore." 


D 
aniels himself grew up in the 
housing projects of the Hill. 
When he first served on 
Board of Aldermen in the 1960s, New 
Haven's Italian-Irish Democratic 
machine dominated politics in the 
city. "The machine functioned for the 
sole purpose of getting people elected 
to city and state offices," Einhorn 
recalled. "The oil of the machine was 
the ability to give out jobs." Under 
this system, relatives and friends of 
machine politicos dominated the city 
payroll. 


By the time Daniels entered poli-
tics, the machine had accepted blacks 
into their ranks, and Daniels worked 
within the system. He served as major-
ity leader of the Board of Aldermen, 
then as a machine-backed state senator 
for ten years. Daniels decided to take 
on the machine in 1989 when he chal-
lenged Mayor Biagio DiLieto, a con-
servative Democrat with ten years in 
office. To everyone's surprise, DiLieto 
dropped out of the race. "He probably 
just saw the writing on the wall-the 
fiscal problems that were around the 
corner," Morand said. 


DiLieto and the machine backed 
bureaucrat John DeStefano for the 
mayoralty; Daniels put himself for-
ward as the people's candidate. His 
victory spawned optimism in New 
Haven for a "rainbow coalition." 


Some of his ideas had remarkable 
success. Daniels' needle-exchange 
experiment became a ~odd nation-
wide. His community-based police 
program, in which beat cops cooper-
ate with neighborhood residents to

prevent crime, earned praise with 
its potential to cut down on police 
brutality and ensure community 
cooperation in law enforcement. 


Despite Einhorn's accusation that 
the mayor has not squeezed 
enough money from Yale, Daniels 
made more progress with the Yale 
Corporation than any other mayor 
in New Haven history when he 
sold the rights-of-way to parts of 
High and Wall Streets. 


In 
exchange, Yale agreed to pay $1.1 
-
turnover of power to the R~gisur this 
September: "Everyone from the mayor 
right on down to the deputy majority 
leader will be a black or Hispanic. 
They can control all the committees 
and shut out every white alderman in 
the city." 


Conservative Democrats like 
Grasso began to drift closer to 
Einhorn. The son of a Republican 
who ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 
1965, Einhorn grew up in Westville_.

million for fire services that had 
always been free. 


But Daniels struggled with a 
deficit that threatened to send the 
city into bankruptcy, and some of his 
appointees didn't seem to know how 
to run a government. The city's mur-
der rate spiraled; its infant mortality 
and AIDS rates soared to the highest 
per capita in the nation. And old 
machine politicians found them-
selves crowded out of government. 


Board of Aldermen President Frank 
Grasso (D-12), who may soon lose 
his post to Latino Alderman Tomas 
Reyes (D-4), complained of the 
1977, he frequently criticized the 
DiLieto administration and the 
Democratic machine, once comparing 
them to the vice and corruption of 
Tammany Hall. Such rhetoric may 
cost him with voters loyal to the old 
machine. Though Reyes admits that 
many machine politicians have decid-
ed not to support Daniels, "In terms 
of public support,. very few Democrats 
have moved over to Einhorn." 


Even his supporters acknowlege 
that Einhorn has his flaws. His atten-
dance at Board of Aldermen meetings 
hovers around 30 percent, and he 
recently paid a $915,000 settlement in 


a malpractice suit filed against his law 
practice. Einhorn has yet to announce 
any concrete budget proposals, and he 
vows to scrap the Wall Street agree-
ment with Yale, even though the 
mayor lacks such authority. But his 
tough-on-crime, 
tough-on-Yale 
rhetoric has proven a powerful magnet 
for disaffected, largely ethnic white 
working- and middle-class voters. 


''Americans are fed up with politicians 
and incumbents," the Advocatls Bass 
said. "New Haven's problems are diffi-
cult, and everyone's confused and frus-
trated with trying to solve them." 


Daniels still holds the edge in 
election polls, and Reyes and Harp 
both believe the media has overstated 
the number of Democrats who sup-
port Einhorn. But the challenger may 
pull off an upset, particularly if dissat-
isfaction with Daniels translates into 
low turnout at the polls. "If I had to, 
I'd pick Daniels, but the race could 
definitely go either way," Bass said. 


If he wins, Daniels wants to reor-
ganize city finances, sponsor new edu-
cational programs for local youth, 
launch a city-wide job training pro-
gram, and put New Haven on tourists' 
maps with such projects as the Volvo 
tennis tournament. Moreover, Daniels 
supporters believe he will continue to 
foster a rainbow coalition where 
blacks and Latinos share power and 
resources equally with whites. 


Einhorn argues that Daniels has 
squandered his opportunity to rejuve-
nate New Haven. "People hear the 
death knells for the city," he said. 
"The mayor makes no decisions; as in 
Hom~ A/on~, the parents are gone. 
There's no one in control." However, 
many doubt that Einhorn would 
prove any more effective than his pre-
decessor. "Daniels is a crummy mayor, 
but Einhorn would be worse," Bass 
said. "On the balance it's a disappoint-
ing choice."
