Guardian Angels 
Silently stalking downtown New 
Haven, the red-bereted Guardian 
Angels are on a self-appointed mission 
to eradicate crime. "It looks quiet 
tonight," said Elliot 'EZ' Zaret into his 
hand-held radio. Since February, when 
the Guardian Angels hit the streets, 
the city has embarked on a new era of 
crime prevention. Many New Haven 
residents see the patrol, trained iri 
martial arts, as the answer to drug-
related crime and the 75 vacancies on 
the police force. 

"A lot of what we do is deter-
rence," said Zaret (MC '91), who 
organized the Angels' New Haven 
chapter. "Because we were on the 
street there wasn't a crime committed. 
We see someone that looks innocent 
and a guy that looks like he's going to 
mug somebody, and they don't con-
nect because we're there." The Angels, 
who carry no weapons, have patrolled 
New Haven since February 13. They 
operate under no special jurisdiction 
and only make citizens' arrests~holdÂ­
ing a suspect captive until the police 
arrive. Zaret said that although he has 
had few run-ins while on patrol, he 
would like to have made more arrests 
to boost morale. 

"These people are cowards, that's 
why they hide behind the gun and the 
gang colors," Zaret said. "If you come 
up with six on one they can't shoot 
you all. There'll be witnesses. You're no 
longer the easy target." When Angels 
enter the headquarters before patrol, 
Zaret searches each one for weapons 
and drug paraphernalia-they must be 
"clean enough to pee in a cup." Then, 
Wednesday through Saturday nights, 
the Angels hit the streets in red berets 
and military-style clothing to fight 
crime. 

'93) wants the Yale Dean's Office to 
recognize the Angels as a student 
group in order to encourage student 
involvement. Currently, the Angels 
recruit by handing out flyers and by 
word of mouth. Two weeks ago 
Elizabeth 
Lane, 
a 
20-year-old 
paramedic, joined the chapter as the 
first female trainee after she heard 
about the group from a colleague. 

Haphazard recruitment, however, has 
failed to draw on all segments of the 
community's population. 

The New Haven chapter does not 
include a single black member. The 
racial imbalance of the mostly white 
patrol has sparked race-specific reac-
tions in the New Haven community-
now over one-third black. In the 
downtown area, white men in business 
suits give the Angels the thumbs-up 
signal as they pass by, but further 
down Chapel Street the group is met 
by thrown bottles and profanity. 

"Until the black youth get involved, 
the Angels won't be as effective as they 
could be," said Ida Wells, the president 
of George Crawford Manor's tenant 
association. 

Despite their shortcomings, the 
has formed at a crucial moment. 
Infighting and factions in the Police 
Department have left the public in the 
lurch. September's "blue flu," when a 
quarter of the force called in sick to 
protest Chief Nicholas Pastore's 
attempts at reorganization, under-
scored the need for collective activism. 
The Angels stress neighborhood self-
reliance. "Do it yourselves," Zaret 
exhorted Westville residents at a town 
meeting. "There's nothing stronger 
than you, looking out for yourselves, 
on your own block. The Guardian 
Angels and the police aren't going to 
do as much as you, the people." 

The police department's recent 
failures have elevated the Angels to the 
ranks of heroes among many New 
Haven residents. Members help orga-
nize block watches and neighborhood 
patrols. Zaret further increases visibili-
ty when he attends town meetings and 
talks to residents. It will take time, 
however, to determine just what 
impact the Guardian Angels have on 
community crime. "Some people see 
us as just a drop in the bucket," said 
Stark, a Guardian Angel. "I prefer to 
think of us as a drop of red dye." 

Although Zaret founded the New 
Haven chapter, only one fellow Yale 
student joined him in the ten-member 
group. Patrol leader Jeff Ald~ich (BR
