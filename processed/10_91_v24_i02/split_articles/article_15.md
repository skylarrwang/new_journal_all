They say that in the height of the 70s, disco diva 
Safari Absolut put aside a brilliant career in dance to 
come to Yale. Her sacrifice wasn't easy. Black, poor, 
and gay, she found that Yale scorned her. Students called 
her a whore, a pervert, unpatriotic-but Safari Absolut 
refused to let them get her down. Instead she started a tra-
dition of outlaw parties and presided over them until she 
met her tragic end doing the two-step at a Gay and Lesbian 
Co-op dance. While purely fictional, her story provides the 
founding mythology for the House of Safari Absolut, a 
small group of primarily gay black men from Yale and New 
"When you>re poor, black, and gay, 
your natural response is to wish you 
were someone else. " 
Haven who strive to affirm their identities in the face of 
homophobia and racism. 


The concept of the house originated in the early 70s as 
a support mechanism for the gay black men of New York 
City who confronted the poverty and violence of urban life. 
While the mission of the House of Safari Absolut is less 
urgent than that of its New York counterparts, each pro-
vides a haven for members who feel alienated from their 
communities. "The house allows a certain refuge, so that at 
the end of the day when the straight white people hate you, 
when the gay white people hate you, and when straight 
black people hate you, you have someplace to go," said a 
senior member of the Hquse. 


The House's philosophy lies somewhere between those 
of a gay fraternity and a performance art troupe. It devotes 
most of its considerable creative energy toward small-scale 
local parties, either at Yale or with the House of Hudger, 
another New Haven house. Jimmy Raines (SY '92) 
described these parties as "orgiastic extravaganzas" held off-
campus or in whatever Yale classroom happens to be empty. 
Although the House publicizes such parties as Love Feast 
and Trip 2069 ("an absurd futuristic party adventure into 
16 TH£ NEW JouRNAL 
flesh and fantasy") with posters on campus, the Yale com-
munity remains unaware of the House itself. .. At Yale, 
there's a whole other experience that most people know 
nothing about, an experience that's tainted with all these 
different evils," Raines said, recalling parties with tureens 
full of cocaine and elegant pastries laced with acid. 


In the tradition of the New York houses, some House 
members dress in drag for their parties, decked in elaborate 
ensembles. One member appeared at a party in a dress 
made entirely of Saran wrap with food coloring for decora-
tion; at another he wore a gold lame halter top with dol-
man sleeves and matching shorts that laced up the front. 


For members of the House, cross-dressing demon-
strates a refusal to accept gender constraints. Some wear 
drag to suit what they perceive as their ambiguous sexual 
identity. "I might wake up one day and think, 'Well, I'm a 
boy,' so I'll put on what the rest of the world sees as boy 
clothes," said Danny Preston (PC '92). "But sometimes I'll 
wake up and think, 'I'm a woman-so watch out!' And I'll 
throw on my little A-line dress and my high heels and hit 
the streets." 


Others in the House cross-dress to leave behind one 
identity and replace it with a more empowering one. Each 
member creates a new House persona and renames himself in 
the process. "I know that no matter what other accomplish-
ments I might achieve along the way, I am first and foremost, 
above any other identity, a gay black man," said Raines. "But 
when I'm Lady Cooch de Ville I become a grand, awesome, 
fearsome type of queen. Knowing that I'm special in this cir-
cle gives me enough to push it through the day." 


Most members name themselves after favorite female 
icons or divas. Creswell Formey (SY '92), for example, 
chose the name Mahogany Chambers with Diana Ross in 
mind. Mahogany refers to the name of Ross' most famous 
movie, in which she played a cha~acter with the last name 
of Chambers. "I worship Diana," said Formey, "and I guess 
I model a lot of my behavior after her and women like her. 
When I'm talking to people, I might do a gesture that I saw 
Diana do in an interview." He tilted his head back and 
flashed a dazzling smile for the audience-Diana protesting 
the flattering suggestion her interviewer just offered.

Paradoxically, the men of the House of Safari Absolut 
choose to emulate the sex symbols of the heterosexual soci-
ety they defy. Yeshi Isaho (a conflation of 'Yes, she is a ho') 
believes House members admire the stature these women 
hold as strong models in black culture, rather than their 
roles as sex symbols. "These women may be mapping out 
what looks like traditional heterosexual desire," he 
explained, "but they don't all behave like that. We're talking 
about women like Aretha Franklin and Tina Turner, who 
overcame all sorts of abuse. These women are strong." 


While Safari Absolut defines its own agenda, 
members follow the lead of the prominent New 
York houses. Their parties appropriate the tradi-
tion of the "ball"-their pageantry of extremes, where gay 
men dress to look like a woman, a straight man, or any of 
their favorite divas. At the ball, crowds cheer the. elaborate 
dress of the drag queens as they judge the performers on 
their ability to "pass" as bona fide women. If the house 
offers these men a physical refuge from the ~angers of 
urban life, the ball allows them a temporary ·emotional 
release. "When you're poor, black, and gay," said Raines, 
"your natural response is to wish you were someone else." 


New Haven residents who frequent the House appreci-
ate its unusual stability. Malcolm, a local dancer who 
turned down offers from the House of Xtravaganza, chose 
Safari Absolut because of its distance from the fiercely com-
petitive ball circuit. He described the "mopping and boost-
ing," or stealing, that goes on at houses whose members 
don't object to shoplifting a $2000 Chanel belt in the name 
of the ball. 


Safari Absolut complements GBLOC (Gays, Bisexuals 
and Lesbians of Color) by serving as a social support group 
rather than a political organization. Four men created the 
House in 1989 to redress the unresponsiveness of the two 
established support groups, the Gay and Lesbian 
Cooperative and the African-American Cultural Center. 


Some House members condemn the Co-op for offenses 
ranging from overt racism to understated lack of concern 
for black gays. Many feel excluded from the Co-op's social 
circle. "The Yale gay community is very incestuous," said
