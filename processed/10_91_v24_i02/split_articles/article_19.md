F
or years I dreamed of arriving at Yale as a freshman. I 
imagined ivy climbing the walls of gothic towers, ven-
erable statues cloaked in the green patina of age, and 
library shelves holding millions of books. Names like "The 
Whiffenpoofs" and "Skull and Bones" echoed in my ears as 
I envisioned three centuries of privilege and tradition. I rel-
ished the stability and substance that I expected Yale to 
offer. 

It's not hard to imagine my shock when I finally arrived 
on campus to see students hawking T-shirts that mourned 
"The Death of the Commons Tradition." Suddenly budget 
deficits and administrative politics invaded my academic 
dream-world. Everyone bemoaned the decline ofYale while 
I struggled simply to find the language lab. 

Like any public school student of the 1980s, I have 
seen the fiscal axe fall. I know how hard it is to reconcile 
unlimited wants and limited resources. Perhaps I had dung 
tightly to the illusion of Yale's financial invulnerability 
because of the price tag attached to it. My parents certainly 
shared this delusion; they couldn't understand how a school 
that costs $22,200 a year could suffer from financial prob-
lems. Of course, the issue is more complex than that, but 
their response made me wonder about Yale's financial prior.:. 
ities. Suffice to say, if the current round of budget talks had 
been a French duel, the administration would have turned 
and fired after only three paces. Of course, my experience 
could have been worse. I could be a varsity wrestler suing 
Yale to reinstate the team that recruited me, or a Philosophy 
major in a department that barely exists. As things turned 
out, the Commons closure was probably a good lesson for 
freshmen, one of those bumps in the road that parents call 
"life's little disappointments." 

Most importantly, the surprises of my first few weeks 
have opened my eyes to a world beneath Yale's "Bright 
College Years" surface. Like the steam tunnels that run 
beneath Yale's streets, an underground network of rumors, 
whispers, and allegations snake through the freshmen class 
about the administration's plans for the future. Any conver-
sation about Yale inevitably turns to one scandal or another. 

Just as I had begun to cope with minor changes like the 
Commons closure, I found out that departments like 
Women's Studies and African-American Studies are crum-
bling under administrative neglect. Then I heard that even 
the study of philosophy at Yale is in danger of dying out. 

These important issues strike at the heart of the univer-
sity-"The Death of a Dining Tradition" pales in compari-
son. And the demise of departments is just the beginning; if 
you keep your ears open, the rumors will burn them off. I 
have heard positively salacious gossip about shadowy 
endowment deals and special professorships. Someone told 
me that Benno has a mysterious aide with a checkered past. 
Does he break kneecaps? Does he secretly run the universi-
ty with Benno as his witless puppet? Who knows? 

Such stories may sound funny to veteran Yalies, but 
they confuse, frustrate, and deeply disappoint freshmen 
with no point of reference. At this point, I'll believe any-
thing I hear about the Yale administration. Where they are 
concerned, truth is stranger than fiction, at least from my 
"fresh" point of view. Case in point: I expected a punchline 
when a junior told me that the same Benno Schmidt who 
now serves as dart-board fodder was the Beloved 
Beermeister of Berkeley just a few short months ago. As the 
Yale Police prepared to end the flow of suds at a courtyard 
party, Benno appeared (on a white horse?) to ,play some 
tunes with Quick Brown Fox. While the partiers chanted 
"Benno! Benno!" our president took a swig of a student's 
beer-without asking to see his drinking card first. For 
God, for country, and for self-aggrandizement. 

Perhaps that incident shows the full extent of Benno's 
concern for undergraduates; on the other hand, Yale 
College Dean Donald Kagan wants to invade every aspect 
of our lives. While Benno partied last spring, Don launched 
a holy crusade in the name of 
academia-against highlighters. To 
Kagan, those must-haves of college life 
actually act as tools of intellectual sub-
version, reducing a writer's life work to 
a series of random facts. No lie. Dean 
Kagan had it in for highlighters, and 
although he didn't succeed in remov-
ing them from the Co-op's shelves, he 
did earn a mocking soundbite on 
CNN Headline News. I had just 
accepted Yale's offer of admission 
when I saw it on TV. I should have 
seen the fluorescent writing on the 
wall. 

I'm glad that our administration 
provides comic relief in the midst of 
the tragedies they visit upon us. But 
underneath the humor lurk worrisome 
administrative woes. About the same 
time that Kagan waged the highlighter 
wars, he spoke to the ultra-conserva-
tive National Association of Scholars, 
in which he used Yale as a straw horse 
to attack the flaws of academic life. In 
one of the more offensive passages, 
Kagan declared that since everyone 
here is so darn liberal, classroom inter-
action between professor and student 
is more like "mutual massage" than the 
grand ideological struggle of his own 
school days. Of course, although he 
finds so much wrong with Yale, Kagan 
addressed his concerns not to the Yale 
community but to a convention of 
like-minded scholars (read: embattled 
reactionary relics). He lacked the good 
sense to make his criticism construc-
tive and the courage to present his 
views to the faculty. Instead, he jetted 
off to the convention and proceeded 
to slander Yale, its professors and its 
students. I always thought the admin-
istration existed to glue the university 
together, not to tear it apart. 

At some point all these incidents 
lose their humor. Quirky style and 
shady dealings belong in a David 
Lynch movie, not at Yale. A college 
president or dean should command 
respect and provide vigorous leader-
ship. After having spent a few weeks 
here, I haven't seen anyone in the 
administration who fits that defini-
tion. I don't expect a president to be 
universally popular and free of contro-
versy, but Yale needs someone who has 
earned the community's respect-real 
respect, not the kind earned at keg 
parties-to lead us through budget 
cuts and other difficult problems with 
a modicum of dignity. 

Many people already have written 
off the current administration as hope-
less. Some say that Yale has lost sight 
of its venerable traditions and academ-
ic goals and aimlessly drifrs anywhere 
but up. Perhaps they exaggerate, but 
while I go to my capped class, eat din-
ner in my college, and rush out of the 
prematurely closing library, I worry 
about the future. If Yale's reputation 
for excellence falls victim to laughable 
leadership, crumbling faculty rela-
tions, ruthless budget cuts and embit-
tered students, who will want to come 
here? Not the caliber of student that 
the vigorous academic life of Yale 
demands, and not the professors we 
have come to expect. 

Yale students cannot allow such a 
decline. One way or another, we must 
pull Yale out of this downward spiral 
of sad fact and rampant fiction. We 
have to channel our complaints about 
Commons and other controversies 
into a realistic discourse on how to 
cure the problems facing Yale. Who 
cares where we eat, as long as it's in a 
great university? I worry more about 
our administration's lack of vision. I 
would have felt silly demonstrating 
against the Commons closure, but I'll 
be there on Benno's lawn when a more 
serious budget cut rolls around, and I 
hope I won't be alone. If the adminis-
tration needs a strong vision for Yale, 
we students can provide one-even 
freshmen. Departments shouldn't dis-
integrate, administrators shouldn't 
snipe at faculty, and budget cuts 
shouldn't destroy the quality of stu-
dent life. 

But if the administration dis-
agrees, Kagan can tilt with liberal 
windmills until he destroys everything 
but his beloved "Common Studies." 
And Benno can just keep on playing 
the role of postmodern Nero.
