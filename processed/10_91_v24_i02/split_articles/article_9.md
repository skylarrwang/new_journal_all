"Political influence? I wasn't aware I 
had any." 

Modesty aside, Arthur Barbieri-
New Haven's quintessential machine 
politician-is no feeble dinosaur. After 
decades of work behind the scenes to 
maintain a fractious party coalition, 
the 75-year-old Democratic Town 
Chair still wields real power. State and 
local politicians respect Barbieri's abili-
ty to garner votes through persuasion 
and patronage. 

The wall that leads to Barbieri's 
office includes photos of John F. 
Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, and former 
New Haven mayors Richard C. Lee 
and Bartholomew Guida. Even U.S. 
Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-3) 
counts the Town Chair as a close ally, 
though she once worked for machine-
breaker Frank Logue, mayor of New 
Haven from 1976-79. "Rosa and her 
family go back years with the New 
Haven Democratic Party," says Paul 
Frick, DeLaura's chief-of-staff. "She 
worked with Logue a long time ago." 
Such testimony shows that Barbieri's 
machine has not become a political 
anachronism. 

During his first tenure as Town 
Chair from 1953 to 1975. Barbieri 
boasted an electoral Midas touch. He 
unified the party behind two-time loser 
Richard Lee and delivered the mayor's 
office to the Democrats in 1953. With 
Barbieri's help, Lee triumphed in seven 
more mayoral elections. Barbieri then 
threw the weight of the machine 
behind Bartholomew Guida, who won 
three consecutive victories. 

"We--the Democratic Party-had 
a very close relationship with the Lee 
and Guida administrations," recalls 
Barbieri. But voters and politicians in 
the post-Watergate era began to regard 
the machine with suspicion. When 
Guida tried to run for a fourth nomi-
6 THE New JouRNAL 
nation in 1975, Frank Logue, then an 
alderman, blew the whistle on the 
"closed corporation." Logue charged 
that Barbieri had single-handedly guar-
anteed Guida the Town Committee 
endorsement. When voters chose 
Logue over Guida in the primary, 
Barbieri resigned as Town Chair. Logue 
rode Democratic 
all the way -to 
Arthur Barbieri: no feeble dinosaur 
the mayor's office. 

Though the machine enjoyed a 
return to power from 1979 to 1989 
with the election of Mayor Biagio 
DiLieto, its heyday had ended. "The 
parties today are not what they used to 
be," Barbieri mourns. "More indepen-
dent-minded people are being elected 
to office, which leaves very little to knit 
the party together." Party cohesion 
crumbled when John Daniels carne to 
power. 

Barbieri's estrangement from 
Daniels provides a marked contrast to 
his close ties wich Lee and Guida. 
Although Barbieri says he would never 
take public action against a Democrat, 
bitterness creeps into his description of 
the current relationship between the 
administration and the party. ''I'm not 
close to the administration," he says. 
"They don't call me vety often." 

The mayor's failure to endorse 
Barbieri for the position ofTown Chair 
in the 1990 election further weakened 
their tie. "After I endorsed John 
DeStefano, Daniels did not ask me to 
resign. He wanted me to help hm;, and 
I did everything I was asked to do," 
recalls Barbieri. "But then, for reasons 
known only to him and those around 
him, they wanted to unseat me." 

According to insiders, Barbieri's 
nominal support for Daniels does not 
match his heartfelt support of past 
machine politicians, Leaning across the 
expanse of his marble desk, Barbieri 
shakes his head wearily as he contem-
plates che uptoming contest. 'Tve 
always predicted elections," he says, 
"but I'm not going co predict this one." 
Party splintering may explain Barbieri's 
hesitancy. "There are indications that 
Aldermanic President Frank Grasso 
(D-12) might endorse Einhorn," says 
Steve Ury, chair of the first ward. "No 
one's sure what Barbieri's going to do 
about it. His old-line people are break-
ing away, and he may sit this one out." 

Still. Arthur Barbieri's commit-
ment to the Democratic Party and to 
New Haven remains strong. "I regis-
tered Democrat because I believed that 
the Democratic Party was the party of 
the people, and I believe that today," 
he says. Barbieri always leaves his door 
open so that anyone who wants to can 
come in and see him. His cylindrical 
office, with its red velvet wallpaper and 
gold double doors, reflects the eccen-
tricities of a man who used to stride to 
the speaker's podium at Democratic 
functions to ~he theme from "The 
Godfather." The days of the united 
machine may be over, but Barbieri 
remains.
