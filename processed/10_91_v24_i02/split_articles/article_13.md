ohn Daniels most likely will win a second term as New 
Haven's mayor on November 5, but with two weeks to 
go the challenger is giving him a run for his money. 
With his conservative stands on ·crime, the budget, and 
public housing, Alderman Jonathan Einhorn (R-25) has 
attracted a sizable following even though Democrats out-
number Republicans in New Haven 10 to 1. An ups.et vic-
tory would make him New Haven's first Republican mayor 
in over 30 years. "It really has more to do with John Daniels 
jonathan Einhorn persistently denies he plays racial politics. 
than it does with me," Einhorn claimed. "He's alienated a 
lot of New Haven." 

Two years ago, Daniels' election seemed to herald a new 
era in New Haven politics. In a city where a conservative 
· Democratic machine had ruled almost J.l.ninterrupted since 
1953, he defeated the machine candidate in a mayoral pri-
mary. Weeks later, backed by a multiethnic coalition of 
black and white progressive Democrats, Daniels coasted 
into office as the first black mayor in New Haven's histoty. 

But his victory quickly soured, as New Haven's fiscal 
and social problef!lS mounted. Daniels inherited a $12 mil-
lion deficit from former mayor Biagio DiLieto, which 
remains even after Daniels slashed city jobs and essential 
services. Critics charge that City Hall teems with bad man-
agement, and New Haven's crime rate has soared to the fifth 
~ highest in the nation. Dreams of a multiethnic coalition 
-. have crumbled, as white residents in middle-class neighbor-
hoods object vehemently to the city's "scattered-site" hous-
ing plan, which mandates government purchase of single-
family homes on their streets for poor black families. 

As minority leader on the Board of Aldermen, Einhorn 
has emerged as Daniels' main critic. W here Daniels has 
instituted community-based policing, Einhorn wants to 
install metal detectors in high schools and call in the 
National Guard to fight crime. Daniels endorses the con-
cept of scattered-site housing, while Einhorn vows to let 
neighborhoods decide whether or not to accept subsidized 
housing--even though New Haven stands to lose millions 
in federal aid if it segregates public housing in poo( black 
areas. 

To many voters Einhorn's conservatism represents a 
promising new approach to the city's social ills. Some 
machine politicos also tout Einhorn to get back at Daniels. 
'They want him swept from office so they can put up a can-
didate more to their liking in two years," said Brian 
Anderson, a former Republican Town Chair. 

On a more serious note, some Daniels supporters allege 
that Einhorn has subtly exploited racial tensions to get votes
