cially rankling the university's failure 
to consult its workers, students, and 
faculty before it decided which areas 
to cut this year. "The administration 
runs this place like a dictatorship: they 
understand what's best for us, and we 
don't," said Clarence Mosely, deputy 
steward for Local 35. "With the bud-
get scenario this year nothing was dis-
cussable-they just drew a line in the 
sand." Deputy Provost Long acknowl-
edged that Yale imposed the recent 
round of cuts from above. "We're real-
ly going to try for wider community 
involvement in the implementation of 
future cuts," he said. 

But for the unions and GE$0, 
such gestures come too late. Already 
both cite cuts in the library system as 
a destructive choice. Yale phased out 
7 1 positions in the libraries this year 
and only avoided lay-offs by absorb-
ing the cuts through attrition. The 
shelving and cataloging departments 
no longer run at full strength, and 
plans to enter pre-1977 works onto 
Orbis have been scrapped. New 
books will enter the computer system 
only through the author-tide cata-
logue, which makes research by sub-
ject difficult. 

Union leaders point to the 
library as the spot where student and 
worker interests converge. "The lost 
jobs in the library have a direct 
impact on the quality of academics_ at 
Yale," said Nancy Ryan of Local 34. 
"Come crunch time this winter when 
people have term papers to do, the 
numbers of lost books due to lack of 
shelving will be extremely notice-
able." She also says the library cuts 
won't save money in the long run. 
"When books aren't shelved they get 
lost, and then have to be reacquired 
and processed, which is expensive." 

Y
ale justifies its draconian mea-
sures as a necessary evil. With 
leaky roofs and crumbling case-
ments, the university channels every 
spare dollar into physical plant reno-
vation. Union officials do not dispute 
that Yale's buildings need repairs but 
argue that renovation should not 
undermine services. "They're planning 
to take from the operating budget like 
it's a cookie jar, and that's just not nec-
essary," said Michael Boyle of Local 
34. 

The unions believe Yale has con-
cored the budget crisis just in time for 
the January negotiations. "In prepar-
ing for talks, the administration will 
plead poverty to try to lower the 
union's expectations," said Dickess. 
"But we are the people who work here 
and deal with their money, and we 
know it's a matter of priorities." The 
unions refuse to take Yale's budget 
worries at face value. "They're going to 
have to document the financial prob-
lem," said Dickess. "Why aren't the 
books open? They say the tabulations 
are too complicated. I say if you have 
nothing to hide, what is your prob-
lem?" 

According to Vallone, the univer-
sity has complied with union requests 
for information whenever possible. 
"We're sharing everything we have 
that relates to the current budget situ-
ation," he said. "They asked for which 
programs would and would not get 
funded in the next five years. There is 
no such document, and if there is it 
would not be appropriate to make it 
public." To the unions, the adminis-
tration's reluctance to share budget 
information indicates that Yale does 
not see its workers as peers. "Yale's 
attitude is one of ar~ogance and pater-
nalism," said Dickess. 

Administrators counter that 
union members see the budget 
through a distoned lens of self-interest. 
"A great portion of the budget is 
restricted for specific uses, and the 
unions don't appear to accept that," 
Vallone said. "It's easy to sharpshoot 
decisions about how money should be 
spent depend~ng on one's own con-
cern. We recognize and respect the 
unions' role on campus, but that 
doesn't mean that in January we'll roll 
over and play dead." 

As the contract deadline nears, 
job security looms as the most contro-
versial item on the agenda. The 
administration plans to reduce Local 
34 employees as part of cutbacks. "We 
have a finite set of dollars, and once 
the Corporation made the decision to 
renovate, we had to size down in other 
places," explained Vallone. "This will 
primarily affect the administrative

paternalism. " 
support staff." Though the university 
has laid off fewer than I 00 people to 
date, Long says more dismissals will 
follow. "Yale has a policy of maintain-
ing competitive staff salaries, and I 
strongly believe we shouldn't fall 
behind in this area. It's much better to 
reduce the numbers of people we 
employ." 

The unions, however, do not buy 
the argument that Yale must fire some 
of its union employees. "In Local 34 
we have a turnover rate of over 500 
people a year," said Boyle. "That 
leaves plenty of room to downsize-
management could redistribute some 
of the work rather than replacing 
everyone. The idea of needing to fire 
at will is a sham." 

The increase in "casual workers" 
disturbs Locals 34 and 35 as well. 
"The administration is continually 
penny-wise, pound-foolish," said 
Boyle. Casuals receive keys to univer-
sity buildings and pose a potential 
security risk. They also work for lower 
pay, but because they have less experi-
ence they often get hurt more, which 
costs Yale in worker's compensation 
and medical care. 

Since medical costs increase 20 
percent every year, Yale wants to scale 
back. "We spend $15 million a year 
on a very liberal policy in which Yale 
pays for pretty much everything," said 
Vallone. The unions will discuss ways 
to keep down medical costs-like dis-
couraging people from claiming work-
er's compensation-but do not feel 
the current package has any padding. 
"The Yale Health Plan is the cheapest 
Health Maintenance Organization in 
Connecticut," said Boyle. "Yale is not 
a small-time employer getting screwed 
by Blue Cross." 

F
or the unions, the option to 
strike offers a way to force Yale's 
hand. But with the recession, 
workers have a lot more to lose than 
they did in 1984. "Yale is the company 
in a company town," said Local 35's 
Mosely. "But it's hard when they 
stretch us like rubber bands until we 
break." The university agenda for the 
talks does not leave much room to 
breathe. "Employees are part of the 
balancing act," said Long. "When we 
negotiate, we're looking at a bleak eco-
nomic picture." 

GESO's ability to affect January's 
negotiations remains unclear. In the 
event of a strike, members of all three 
organizations will vote on whether or 
not to walk out together. Still, the pre-
sent level of cooperation is high. 
"Personally, I would never cross a 
picket line anywhere, ever," said 
Dickess. "And I consider myself repre-
sentative." In a recent poll of Local 35 
members, 90 percent said they would 
strike for recognition of GESO. 

At present, GESO and Locals 34 
and 35 want to reach out to students 
and faculty in order to build a consen-
sus about the budget crisis. By focus-
ing attention on cuts to amenities like 
the libraries, which Yale's academic 
excellence demands, they hope to fos-
ter campus-wide protest. But if the 
campus remains unmoved, or if the 
university chooses not to listen, Yale 
will face its second major strike in 
eight years.
