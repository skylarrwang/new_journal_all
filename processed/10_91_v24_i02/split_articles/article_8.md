EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
With Yale's budget in shambles, the unions on 
the verge of strike, and New Haven divided 
by politics of class and race, why did we put 
a drag queen on our cover? What is it about a small 
group of gay black men that comprise the core of the 
House of Safari Absolut that intrigues us? We'd like to 
think that groups such as Safari Absolut(page 16) and 
Asian evangelicals at Yale (page 22) raise issues beyond 
the confines of their own agendas. In an environment 
as heterogeneous and intimidating as Yale, all of us 
need to carve out our own space. The members of 
Safari Absolut often feel estranged from the very 
groups that were designed to support them, so they 
have created their own. Though the 12 members of the 
group may seem too few to warrant attention from a 
university of 12,000, we found that their search for an 
accepting community carries a universal message. 
Are we merely voyeurs, exploiting lives for a 
cover shot? We hope not. Our stories go beyond a 
voyeuristic gloss, and we want our readers to come 
away with a deepened understanding of what lies 
underneath a seductive exterior. We may all be taken 
by the spectacle of wigs and gold lame at a Co-op 
dance, but by investigating the lives behind the image 
we shed light on our community and ourselves. And in 
putting together the magazine we have learned that the 
House of Safari Absolut and the Campus Crusade for 
Christ share more than either group might imagine.

**Title: Letter to the Editor**

To rhe editor: 
I found "The Last Bastion: Wolf's 
Head Confronts Coeducation" 
[Sept. 6] fair and balanced. You 
did an excellent job of presenting 
both views of an admittedly 
thorny issue. 

While nor necessarily agreeing 
with Sam Chauncey's politics or 
perspectives, I have always 
admired him for speaking our for 
what he believes in. I would rake 
exception with Sam, however, for 
quitting Wolf's Head "in disgust" 
(I wasn't aware he had until your 
article) after the failure of rhe 
1984 vore 
ro 
change the 
membership srarus. 

I, for one, promise Sam rhar I 
will nor quit "in disgust" when 
Wolf's Head becomes coed, which 
I am convinced ir will with the 
next membership Â·vote. After all, 
shouldn't a Yale education, at the 
margin ar least, leave us with some 
respect for the democratic process? 

Perhaps we would all have been 
better served by Sam had he been 
willing to stay in the group 
lighting candles rather rhan 
quitting the darkness. I hope he'll 
rejoin when the issue is resolved ro 
his liking.
