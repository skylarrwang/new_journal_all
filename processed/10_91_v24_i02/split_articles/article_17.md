Faith at Yale 
((I would prefer to see this campus primarily 
Christian-not for my sake, but for everyone's 
sake," said Sidd Puri (CC '93). "If students don't 
have any reason to live and can only derive pleasure from 
things like getting drunk, it's a terribly empty life." Puri, 
pitch of the Christian singing group Living Water, believes 
most Yale students suffer from an unfulftlled spiritual need. 
Puri sees evangelical Christianity as an alternative to the 
non-religious lives he believes most students lead. Zealous 
religious beliefs and conservative social views alienate the 
evangelicals from the campus mainstream. Many have 
sought out Yale's tight-knit evangelical community as a 
haven. 

In recent years, the subculture of approximately 200 
believers has become largely Asian-American, adding racial 
and cultural bonds to the evangelical community. This year 
Asian-Americans comprise 12 out of the 16 singers in 
Living Water. Puri worries that Living Water may come 
aero~.; as an all-Asian group. "I don't know why there are 
suddenly so many Asians involved," he said. "It's a recent 
phenomenon, just over the past three or four years. It's not a 
bad thing unless everyone begins to think we are an Asian-


Living Water demonstrates the most dramatic change 
in racial makeup, with its increase from three to twelve 
Asian-American evangelical singers in two years. But other 
groups have experienced startling increases as well. Yale 
Christian Fellowship (YCF) has seen the Bible-study ses-
sions that form the core of its activities grow from 30 per-
cent Asian-American to over 50 percent. "Since I was a 
freshman, we've had a couple of Asian student leaders and 
the number of Asians has grown to more than half," said 
Toni Huang (ES '92), YCF's student leader. "I think Asians 
attract other Asians." 

The racial composition of these groups raises questions 
about the relationship between evangelical Christianity and 
Asian-Americans. "Historically, many Asian-American 
immigrants were Christian converts," said Linda Yueh, co-
moderator of the Asian-American Students Association 
(AASA). Some speculate that Asians converted to 
Christianity in order to gain easier entrance into the United 
States. Once here, however, the immigrants continued to 
raise their families in accordance with their new-found reli-
gion. "Since families are so important in Asian-American 
culture, it is not unusual for children to be influenced by 
their parents and remain religious," said Yueh. 

Beyond Yale's walls, Asian-American evangelism has 
sprouted at colleges nationwide. Campus Crusade for 
Christ (CCC), a national organization with a Yale chapter, 
sparks controversies at American universities with provoca-
tive posters and guest speakers. David Mahan, a Yale chap-
lain for CCC, says that chapters across the country have 
seen the numbers of Asian-Americans skyrocket in the past 
few years. Mahan welcomes. the influx. "It's exciting that 
Asian-
American 
communities are 
so open to and 
interested in following 
Christ. I think there is a 
greater spiritual interest 
among Asian-Americans than 
among your typical European-American 
groups." 

Tennis star Michael Chang provides a visible example 
of evangelism among young Asian-Americans. In 1989, 
when Chang became the only American man in three 
decades to win the French Open, his first words of thanks 
were to "My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." 

Asian-American evangelicals at Yale express similarly 
strong feelings for God. "The Lord gave me a perspective," 
wrote Ruth Ku (CC '93) in the Fall 1991 issue of the Ya/~ 
Standard, a semi-annual evangelical magazine. "Now I cannot 
possibly run away from Him. Now, I owe Him my life." Such 
declarations of open faith seem out of place at a secular Yale. 
However, evangelical Christians talk like this every day and 
put their words into practice. Students in YCF meet weekly 
to study the Bible with other Christians in their residential 
colleges. Through these groups evangelicals deepen their 
faith and learn to apply the Bible to their lives. 

In the informal atmosphere of Bible study, evangelicals 
solidify their relationships with each other and with God. 
"'I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God 
unless he is born again'-
What does Jesus mean here?" 
asked the leader of a recent YCF Morse-Stiles Bible-study 
group about a passage in John. In the circle of the evangeli-


cals, faith-and the assumption that 
the Bible is the literal word of God-
replaces the academic approach of a 
Religious Studies seminar. 

E
vangelicals' faith includes a 
mission at Yale to spread the 
word of God. While Yale's evan-
gelicals do not boast the charismatic 
style of televangelists like Oral 
Roberts, their proselytizing has antag-
onized several groups on campus. In 
recent years evangelicals have attacked 
d rinking and pre-marital sex as well as 
abortion and homosexuality. 

CCC caused a stir last spring dur-
ing Bisexual 
Gay and Lesbian 
Awareness Days (BGLAD). They blan-
keted dining halls with table tents quot-
ing Biblical passages that decried homo-
sexuality as a sin. "It was not a condem-
nation-we just wanted to show that 
there is more than just one perspective 
on this issue," Mahan said. "The evan-
gelical Christians see BGLAD the same 
way they would see a National Adultery 
Week or a National Lying Week or a 
National Date-Rape Week."' 

Despite their stated intentions, the 
CCC table tents sparked outrage from 
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Co-oper-
ative. Sam Zalutsky (PC '92), a mem-
ber of the Co-op, angrily attacked the 
CCC table tents for their insensitivity. 
Zalutsky worries that the table tents 
hurt religious people who struggle with 
their sexuality. "It upsets me that they 
believe such things. There are plenty of 
people who call themselves C hristian 
that accept homosexuality," Zalutsky 
said. "It's a fallacy that if I pray to God I 
won't be gay. I'm gay and proud of it. 
It's not something I can change." 

Despite the intransigence of a sec-
ular community, evangelicals continue 
fighting to christianize Yale. Their 
confidence that the Gospel supersedes 
all other moralities leaves them at log-
gerheads with much of the university. 
"People's attitudes on this campus are 
like this: 'Believe what you believe. 
T hat's fine-just don't bother me 
about it,' " said Michael Wang (ES 
'94), a member of CCC. "But we con-
sider the Bible a truth that is absolute, 
not relative. It's as if we knew 
Hurricane Bob was coming and we 
wanted other people to know. If peo-
ple don't want to hear, we still must 
tell them because the hurricane is still 
coming."
