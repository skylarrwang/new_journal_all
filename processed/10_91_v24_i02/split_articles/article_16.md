T
he Yale Center for International and Area Studies 
stands in the midst of a storm over the future of 
Yale as a world university. As enrollment triples in 
classes like colonial Latin American history and introducto-
ry Korean, Yale's interdisciplinary international programs 
struggle to keep up with a growing student interest in the 
world. Behind the Center's aspirations, however, lie crucial 
historical and structural problems that may determine not 
just how but what foreign cultures and societies Yale will 
teach. As James Scott, a political science professor, put it, 
"This is still a university very much centered on the Anglo-
American world." Attempting to expand as Yale contracts, 
the Center tries to use limited funds and resources to sup-
port a multitude of programs and finds itself unable to save 
them all. 

The Center acts as Yale's clearinghouse for any activi-
ties of regional or international focus. These include the 
seven Area Studies councils, a thriving International 
Relations (IR) graduate program, and the new 
International Studies major. Recent fundraising coups, like 
the $10 million grant from the Luce Foundation for the 
Center's new building, two large gifts to East Asian Studies, 
and money from the government and from various corpo-
rations for International Studies, have launched 
International ;md Area Studies into one of the university's 
most prominent areas of growth. 

"In a sense, cultural studies are being defit:ted at Yale," 
said J. Michael Holquist, chair of Soviet and East European 
Studies (SEES). "In the past we have not been able to com-
pete because our strengths were not in the social sciences. 
'1nternational and Area Studies are 
not a priority at this unit;ersity--
they're like foster children. " 

We do have a lot of strength in the humanities. We are now 
in a period of transition, moving from a dated cold war 
model to a more diffuse study of cultures. This permits us 
to exploit our existing strengths." 

Since the Center's endowment and grants support the 
majority of its programs, the current budget cutbacks may 
not directly affect International and Area Studies. "In a 
period of cutbacks like this, programs like ours arc in a 
stronger posicion," said Deborah Davis, chair of East Asian 
Studies (EAS). By and large, however, grant money that 
flows inco the Cencer goes to already well-established pro-
grams. 

The faculty and library resources of fields like IR and 
EAS make them more attractive candidates for outside 
funding. Poorer programs like Latin American Studies

their survival. As the Center's outreach 
coordinator Brian Carter said, "It's 
like the Biblical injunction: To those 
that have more will be given more." A 
stronger program also encourages 
more students to enroll. "If I were a 
freshman," said Abigail Horn (CC 
'92), a LAS major, "I would probably 
look into International Studies as a 
major only because it's so much 
stronger." 

Latin American Studies faces a 
crisis. A decade ago, LAS ranked 
among the most active councils at the 
Center, with a strong library collec-
tion, a large number of professors in 
the social sciences, and three full-time 
workers. Loss of funds and faculty 
have decimated the program. "Now all 
they have is an answering machine," 
Latin Ammcan Studi~s major Abigail 
Horn has sun h~r program crumbk. 
said Shawn Smallman (GRD '94), 
who studies Latin American history. 
Last year, Daniel James, an associate 
professor of history, left Yale for a 
tenured position at Duke University, 
leaving the department with no senior 
Latin American expert. 

Without faculty in policy-orient-
2.0 THE NEW jOURNAL 
ed fields like economics, political sci-
ence, and history, the council has lost 
many government grants. Weak pro-
grams like LAS find themselves caught 
in a vicious circle: they cannot get 
money without faculty, and they can-
not hire faculty without money. "It 
has occurred to me that LAS needs to 
be phased out in order to jolt 1he 
administration into making a com-
mitment to it," said Mary Miller, 
chair of LAS. "I don't see why we 
should grace the blue book with the 
illusion that we have it when we 
don't." 

P
rofessor Gaddis Smith, director 
of the Center, oversees an enor-
mous number of people and 
programs, broadly organized under 
either a topical or a regional focus. 
Topical studies include the undergrad-
uate International Studies major and 
International Relations-a two-year 
M.A. program with a current enroii-
:.:J ment of 63 students. The seven Area 
! Studies councils make up the Center's 
regional division. These include EAS, 
LAS, and SEES, which offer under-
graduate majors, as well as African, 
Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and 
West European Studies. Last year, the 
Center and the councils sponsored 
175 conferences, seminars, and lec-
tures, hosted visiting scholars, pub-
lished books and assisted research. 

"The place is organized like the Holy 
Roman Empire of the 11 OOs," said 
Carter of the councils' divergent agen-
das, "with little fiefdoms and cross-
cutting allegiances." 

Is Gaddis Smith, then, the 
Center's benevolent emperor? "Yes, 
but I don't have much to be benevo-
lent with," he said. Erratic funding 
has plagued the Center since the early 
70s, when the Ford Foundation grants 
that helped create it ran out. Like 
international studies centers at other 
American universities, Yale's Center 
traces its origins back to the early 60s, 
when global political and social 
changes triggered a flood of funds 
from foundations and government 
into universities. 

Money went to graduate fellow-
ships, retraining faculty to specialize 
in foreign issues, and the creation of 
international "centers" nationwide. 
"In a panic, they created experts on 
every country in the world," said 
Kenneth Maxwell, a visiting lecturer 
in history. As foundations lose interest 
in global studies, the money dried up. 
Is Gaddis Smith the 
Centers benevolent 
emperor? 

The economic contractions of the 70s 
further prev~nted universities from 
hiring the new regional and interna-
tional experts they had produced in 
the 60s. 

When the Ford grants to Yale 
expired, the university nearly abol-
ished councils without endowments. 
After the director and the council 
chairs desperately lobbied the univer-
sity, international and area studies 
continued at a near-subsistence level. 
Yale's present financial contribution to 
the Center remains small. Sixty per-
cent of the Center's funds come from 
its own endowment, 30 percent from 
assorted grants and only 10 percent 
from 
the 
universiry's 
General 
Appropriations 
budget. 
"Yale 
University per se provides us with an 
office and pays for our telephone 
rental," says Barbara Munck, senior 
administrative assistant at African 
Studies. 

W h ile some councils, notably 
EAS and SEES, found alternate 
sources of fUnding, others could not.

America and Southeast Asia, in con-
trast, remain marginal foreign policy 
concerns and attract few wealthy phi-
lanthropists. "It's hard to get money 
from Larin America for Latin 
America," sai<t Miller. James Scott, 
chair of Southeast Asian Studies, 
pointed out, "The reason why 
President Schmidt flies ro Hong Kong 
and Japan is because these are places 
with a big future. The reason why he's 
not going to Burma or T hailand is 
because there's no money there." 

The precarious status of interdis-
ciplinary fields further complicates the 
position of all the councils and pro-
grams at the Center, not just LAS. 
Without faculty of their own, the 
councils depend heavily on rhe hiring 
priorities of the actual departments. 
"It's politics," said Smith, "trying ro 
persuade people that it's in their inter-
est to hire more internationally mind-
ed faculty." So even though the Center 
does not depend on Yale for funding, 
many students and faculty worry that 
budget cutbacks could rob the pro-
grams of their professors. "Yale calls it 
downsizing," one professor said. "But 
what's happening here is a purge 
D~borah Davis' East Asian Studi~s 
council boasts famous faculty. 
according to some intellectual view." 

The university's faculty curs may 
contradict demands by a changing 
student body for a more international 
curriculum. Demographic changes 
and expanding multiculturalism have 
brought foreign cultures into modern 
education. "People are starting to feel 
that even if they don't' have a direct 
interest in ocher cultures, they 
should," said Melanie Drogin (BK 
'92), an EAS major. This fall, the 
Center's councils and programs guide 
100 graduate sruden ts and over 60 
undergraduate majors. East Asian 
Studies ranks as the tenth largest 
major in Yale College. "You're getting 
a much more diversified student body 
that demands-and rightly so-a 
more comprehensive view of what 
goes into the formation of the modern 
world," said Maxwell. 

Carter sees the recent influx of 
funds as an indication of a more vigor-
ous 
future 
fo r 
Center. 
"International and area studies is a 
part ofYale that is grotesquely under-
developed," he said. "It's not that 
we're leaping ahead, it's that we're 
starting to catch up." Bur the new 
Luce Building will fulfill only the first 
step in the Center's program of devel-
opment. Without sustained funding 
and persistent pressure, the universi-
ty's historical indifference to world 
education may prevail. "International 
~ and Area Studies are nor a very high 
........ priority at this university-they're like 
foster children, like an afterthought," 
said Scott. 

As already strong programs bene-
fit from new grants, the weaker ones 
decay. Larin American Srudic:s may 
require a massive infusion of money 
and support from the university as 
well as from the Center. The question 
remains whether Yale values an inter-
national education enough to make 
that commitment.
