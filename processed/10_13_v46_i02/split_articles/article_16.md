I grew up dancing, and I rely on this sen­
timental-sounding phrase to explain that I 
began dancing well before I wanted to. For 
many years I danced as much as I played 
or worked at school, and when I came of 
age, I confronted dance as an inextricable 
part of my sense of self. Dancing places me 
squarely within my family and its dramas 
and daily life, because my family is full of 
dancers. My choice to go to college was, in 
many ways, drastically alternative. I was 
raised with the assumption that, someday, 
I would go on to dance full-time. When I 
return home, I find the assumption still 
alive.  Sometimes I think of my time here 
as a sanctioned, four-year vacation from 
being who I am. Tomorrow I’ll wake up and re­
member that I’m actually 
a dancer, and have been 
this whole time. 

Part of the unique 
claim that dance has on 
a dancer’s identity is 
that, in order to become 
a good dancer, you must 
be raised according to its 
precepts. Most good dancers are children, 
their skill and talent not a consequence of 
choice, but of strict deference to figures of 
authority. And so when parents raise their 
children, they guide them toward what 
is useful in their endeavors. When danc­
ers raise their children, they guide them 
toward mirrors. Nothing is so useful, be­
cause dancers use mirrors to understand 
their work. Terrifyingly, their work is their 
own bodies. To grow up dancing, I felt, was 
to learn that being hard-working and self-
critical was not a matter of introspection, 
but one of constantly improving the way I 
appeared in a mirror. 

When I arrived at college, I felt inade­
quate to my peers, homesick, and incapable 
of finding my way here. I knew I had come 
to Yale to find a place in the world, so at the 
beginning of my sophomore year, I Googled 
the closest ballet studio and started going 
every day. Nothing tells you who you are so 
accurately as a mirror; ballet studios are 
full of them. 

I attended ballet class that year with 
a newfound desperation. I know this be­
cause if I try, I now remember those nine 
months as one continuous staring into the 
mirror, a time in which I kept noticing the 
shortcomings of my own body, and return­
ing my gaze back to the image of my re­
flected eyes. Because ballet is an exacting 
art form, it quickly becomes psychologi­
cally disturbing, in its recursiveness and 
in its daily demands. Your leg is never high 
or long enough; there is always someone 
better than you. I found solace in looking 
myself in the eye threateningly, demand­
ing of myself that I work 
harder. By the end of the 
year, I had overused my 
right hip flexor and de­
veloped a crippling anxi­
ety problem. I had no idea 
who I was. 

But there are some 
things from that time 
that I remember clearly. 
A dancer’s talent, for ex­
ample, is measured in two ways: how much 
physical potential he was born with and 
has maintained, and how willing he is to 
grit his teeth and use it well. This appears 
to be a standard definition of talent, until 
you hear ballet teachers reconcile the two 
metrics and reassign students into multi­
plying categories. There are dancers “with 
great facility,” but who are lazy. These 
dancers often look as they should, but re­
main weak and careless. There are dancers 
who are “inspiring” because they work hard 
and “to their full potential.” These dancers 
don’t have the body to do well, but “love to 
dance.” Then there are dancers who are 
beautiful. 

So few dancers strike this balance and 
achieve that distinction. Those who do of­
ten acquire an eerie, almost glassy look in 
their eye. They rarely find their own eyes 
in the mirror. Rarely do they look you in 
yours. I think, somewhere along the way, 
I grew up dancing, and I 
rely on this sentimental-
sounding phrase to explain 
that I began dancing well 
before I wanted to.
