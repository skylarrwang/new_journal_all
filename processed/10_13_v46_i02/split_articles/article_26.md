ust six blocks south of the New Haven 
Green, the strongest signs of life are the 
distant roar of traffic on the Route 34 
Connector and the less-regular stream of 
cars here on Church Street South. A school­
bus drops off a girl carrying a backpack 
with a cartoon design whose mother waits 
to walk her home. I watch two boys behind 
them bike back and forth on the sidewalk. 
They are the only pedestrians on this bou­
levard. Though I’ve been told that the long 
beige buildings to my left hold three hun­
dred residences, the nearly-empty streets 
of the neighborhood make that hard to be­
lieve.

“CHURCH STREET REDEFINED: A VI­
TAL MAIN STREET FOR NEW HAVEN’S 
HILL-TO-DOWNTOWN 
DISTRICT.” 
The 
black letters crown the city development 
plans that were unveiled at a public meet­
ing at Hill Central School on September 24. 
The plans are part of an effort by city offi­
cials to dramatically re-envision the future 
of this area between Union Station, Yale 
School of Medicine, and downtown. With­
in a decade, the street I am walking along 
could be thronged with residents of differ­
ent ages, incomes, and backgrounds living 
in new four-to-six-story homes. They could 
take long walks through a neighborhood 
bordered by an array of shops and restau­
rants.

If they succeed at redefining Church 
Street, the project will be the second ma­
jor identity shift for the area in the past 
sixty years. What officials now sterilely 
label as the “Hill-to-Downtown District” 
once formed part of the vibrant Oak Street 
neighborhood. In 1959, a diverse but poor 
community of immigrants lived in the 
area. It was culturally rich, but physically 
poor, and officials fixated on the limited 
infrastructure. Instead of improving living 
conditions, the government decided to de­
molish the neighborhood altogether. Three 
thousand people were displaced. Subsi­
dized highways and mass production were 
making the automobile a ubiquitous pres­
ence in American culture, and the project 
aimed to clear the way for a freeway—the 
Route 34 Connector—to send traffic from 
Interstate 95 smoothly into downtown 
New Haven. City planners envisioned a city 
in which commerce would flow, unimped­
ed by the Oak Street neighborhood. Mayor 
Richard C. Lee was certain that New Haven 
would become “a slumless city—the first in 
the nation.”

But rather than supporting an urban 
core, the highway accelerated a mass exo­
dus to the suburbs. It served commuters, 
not the dwindling surrounding population. 
By the time political momentum for Lee’s 
mid-century urban renewal project ran out, 
plans for a longer highway were scrapped—
the connector now splits at the hulking Air 
Rights Garage into the two forks of Legion 
Avenue—and the promises of a renewed 
city were unfulfilled. With the Oak Street 
neighborhood permanently razed, the con­
nector became infamous for dividing the 
city in two—separating the Hill neighbor­
hood to the south from downtown New 
Haven. Today, the several-block trek from 
the Hill to the Green, or from Yale School of 
Medicine to the heart of campus, is a knot 
of over- and underpasses. Blocks are long, 
and loud with the roar of speeding cars.

New initiatives are aimed at reener­
gizing the urban wasteland created by the 
connector. In 2007, the city was awarded 
a federal Transportation Investment Gen­
erating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant 
to convert the eastern section of Route 
34, which runs from Park Street to Union 
Avenue, into two “urban boulevards”—with 
traffic lights, narrower lanes, and a lower 
speed limit—alongside new developments. 
The ambitious project, called Downtown 
Crossing, will eventually lower the Col­
lege Street overpass to street level. Phase 
I of construction will replace a segment of 
highway at 100 College Street with a new 
pharmaceutical skyscraper. Ground was 
first broken in June.

The Downtown Crossing project will 
pave the way for a larger—and, ideally, a 
more coherent—urban plan. To achieve

this, as the Downtown Crossing project 
advances, the city is simultaneously rede­
signing the area lying south of the Connec­
tor, between Union Station and the medi­
cal school. Called “Hill-to-Downtown,” the 
expansive new project includes two large 
residential-and-retail developments, the 
first across the street from Union Station 
and the second on a more upscale site in 
the former Coliseum property just north 
of Route 34. The first development sits 
on Church Street, which in the new plan 
forms the centerpiece of the district, with 
more 
stores, 
housing, 
and greenspace. The dis­
trict will host new office 
and lab buildings, most 
of them serving the bio­
medical 
industry 
that 
currently dominates the 
area around the medical 
school on the district’s 
western side. Residents 
and officials hope that 
the changes brought by this pair of major 
projects will reap social and economic ben­
efits for the neighborhood, transforming 
an area still feeling the effects of the six­
ties-era urban renewal into a community.

“You could classify Oak Street back 
then as a slum,” acknowledged Robert Sil­
verman in a 2004 interview, “but it was a 
thriving slum. People were living in the 
houses, business was in the stores, and 
business was being done.

Silverman lived in the Oak Street 
neighborhood until it was razed. Along 
with several other former residents, he 
lent his voice to a historical project un­
dertaken through the Manuscripts and 
Archives department of Yale’s Sterling Me­
morial Library in the early 2000s. The New 
Haven Oral History Project compiled voice 
interviews of these New Havenites into an 
exhibit called “Life in the Model City,” a ref­
erence to the Johnson administration’s na­
tional Model Cities project, which had been 
inspired by Lee’s program for New Haven. 
Silverman remembers urban renewal with 
bitterness; it displaced Jewish  organiza­
tions he had belonged to, and erased many 
other features of a previously flourishing 
community.

Today, few homes remain in the area 
where Oak Street disappeared, and resi­
dents nearby miss these hallmarks of a 
lively neighborhood. “There’s a lot of nos­
talgia for what used to be,” says Chris Soto, 
who works for the mayor’s office’s Livable 
City Initiative.

There is good reason to look back with 
longing. Since the remov­
al of the so-called slum, 
the 
Hill-to-Downtown 
area has felt lifeless and 
bleak. On Church Street, 
vast swaths of surface-
level parking surround 
squat office and medi­
cal buildings. Iron fences 
and security cameras re­
mind passersby that they 
are not welcome.

Crossing the street on a sunny Tuesday, 
I start to reconsider. Despite the city’s mis­
takes, some features of a community have 
clearly taken root. The beige buildings of 
the government-subsidized Church Street 
South housing complex seem lived-in. Res­
idents stroll around and lounge beneath 
the trees of a small designated greenspace. 
Groups of people gather on the balconies or 
sidewalks, chatting in Spanish and English. 
A young man stands at the corner with a 
skateboard and a spaniel. This atmosphere 
gives me hope that I had misinterpret­
ed the foreboding atmosphere. Perhaps 
Church Street South has retained the com­
munal atmosphere that I thought had been 
lost decades ago. A family jokes and laughs 
together in front of their apartment door. 
I approach the group and ask them what it 
is like to live there. Two of them introduce 
themselves as Shanequa and Tangie, and, 
asking not to be identified by their last 
names, tell me: 

Within a decade, the 
street I am walking along 
could be thronged with 
residents of different 
ages, incomes, and 
backgrounds.

“Shitty,” Shanequa says, then adds, 
pausing between each word, “Trashy. 
Messed-up. Terrible.” 
At each word, the others nod. “Every­
thing’s falling apart,” Shanequa says. Prob­
lems abound, and the street feels unsafe 
for the families who live there. “The area 
point-blank is bad, with drug dealers, and 
our kids having to see it all.” 

To make Church Street South a better 
home, developers would “have to do a lot of 
rearrangement of the people. They’d need 
to rebuild it, step up security, make it safer 
for kids,” she adds.

Developers have made an attempt to 
respond to residents’ concerns. Represen­
tatives from the mayor’s office, as well as 
from Goody Clancy, the architecture firm 
hired by the city to lead the project, held 
a series of public meetings at Hill Central 
School. After listening to feedback from 
New Havenites, particularly residents 
of Hill neighborhood and Church Street 
South, the firm spent three months nar­
rowing the ideas into a single drafted plan, 
unveiled on September 24.

At the meeting, I listened as David 
Spillane, Goody Clancy’s director of plan­
ning and urban design, explained the plan 
behind that promising title: CHURCH 
STREET REDEFINED. He envisions a thriv­
ing district centered around Church Street 
as its main commercial and residential 
street.

At previous meetings, Church Street 
South residents had advocated for grocery 
stores, pharmacies, and other shops that 
would serve their daily needs. Planners for 
Goody Clancy and the city have acknowl­
edged these requests, but because the 
properties are privately owned, they are 
vague about which businesses will eventu­
ally move in there. “They potentially serve 
residents, they potentially serve commut-

What was once the Oak Street neighborhood is now a dense tangle of overpasses, surface-level 
parking, and office buildings.
