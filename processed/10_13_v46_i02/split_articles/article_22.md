Slaughterhouse of Literature,” calling close 
reading a “secularized theology…that has 
radiated from the cheerful town of New 
Haven over the whole field of literary stud­
ies.”

Things have changed since Moretti 
wrote that essay, but Yale’s English and 
Literature departments are still known for 
emphasis on close reading, and the Univer­
sity has been reluctant to embrace the “dis­
tant reading” aspects of digital humanities 
research. “We have a deep commitment to 
close reading, and that is something that 
computers have not been good at doing 
yet: that very human act of reading, under­
standing, digesting, and making an argu­
ment,” said English professor Amy Hunger­
ford, whose work in American literature 
has grown to encompass studies of chang­
ing media forms.

For Hungerford, the 
development of digital 
humanities at Yale, par­
ticularly in her depart­
ment, is a “chicken-and-
egg problem.” In order to 
attract digital humani­
ties scholars, Yale needs 
to have the community, 
resources, and senior fac­
ulty that support them. 
But in order to invest in those resources, 
someone needs to lobby the administration 
and raise awareness about the need for 
Yale to make those investments. 

Trip Kirkpatrick, a member of the Digi­
tal Humanities Working Group and a senior 
instructional technologist for Yale, agreed 
that the growth of the digital humanities 
at Yale hasn’t been as rapid as it has been 
at some peer institutions. “Yale is in many 
ways a structurally conservative institu­
tion,” said Kirkpatrick. “It’s been around for 
over three hundred years and expects to be 
around permanently, so it looks at things 
in terms of big time frames.”

Meanwhile, the digital world moves 
fast. Kirkpatrick pointed out that Wikipe­
dia, a now indispensible resource for most 
college students, was only invented in 
2001. The digital humanities is evolving at 
a similarly rapid pace, in a way that might 
be difficult for Yale to deal with under its 
current system. “What Yale needs to be 
working on is not necessarily making in­
dividual changes, but figuring out ways to 
adapt to change differently,” Kirkpatrick 
said. “We’re great on stability, not so much 
on agility.”

Kirkpatrick still hopes that digital hu­
manities can be worked into the curricu­
lum. He imagines an English department 
in which professors might list macroanal­
ysis as one of many scholarly interests—
right alongside, say, Anglo-Saxon poetry or 
Marxism—and a course on computational 
stylistics might be offered as an elective 
for undergrads.

There are already some scholars in­
corporating digital tech­
niques and social science 
tools into their work, 
Kirkpatrick pointed out; 
they simply don’t publish 
in online journals devot­
ed to digital humanities 
or consider it central to 
their research. There is 
a pitfall: having scholars 
use digital techniques 
without maintaining digital humanities’ 
separate identity makes it difficult to eas­
ily identify progress. “If digital text analy­
sis falls alone in a forest, does anybody hear 
it?” Kirkpatrick asked. He believes that 
digital humanities will only be thought 
of as a self-standing field if scholars who 
clearly identify their work as digital hu­
manities become successful.

I asked Leonard what separates the so­
cial sciences from the humanities if both 
begin to use the same tools. For him, what 
differentiates the disciplines isn’t so much 
methodology as the sort of questions they 
want to ask, but he acknowledged that the 
relationship can be “uneasy.”

“People will keep doing close readings 
forever,” Leonard said. “It’s just that some

people are interested in supporting close 
readings with quantitative and algorith­
mic analysis of humanities data.”

Regardless of how the work is labeled, 
the new generation of scholars is clearly 
making a turn toward a more technologi­
cal approach. Erin Maher, a senior at Yale, 
is a perfect example: she began her under­
graduate years in the humanities before 
switching computer science, and finally 
majoring in women’s, gender and sexuality 
Studies. “I thought, well, now I have to drop 
my interest in technology,” Maher said. But 
classes like Wexler’s that incorporate new 
media studies have allowed her to find an 
intersection between her two interests.

Maher’s senior project, under Wexler’s 
guidance, will study communities devel­
oped on the microblogging website Tumblr. 
In the past, Maher told me, anthropologists 
studying communities like Tumblr have 
tended to be “disconnected.” “They publish 
their work in places that the people they’re 
writing about will never have access to,” 
she explained.

Maher also works as a programmer 
for Yale’s Information Technology Ser­
vices, helping develop educational tools 
such as Pnut, which will allow students to 
give lecturers feedback in real time. She’s 
hoping that in the future she will use her 
programming skills to help build more ac­
cessible scholarly publishing platforms on­
line, building ladders in and out of the ivory 
tower.

It’s this ethos that particularly drives 
Chiodo in her work on the history of Dante 
scholarship. “We’ve got seven hundred-plus 
years of commentaries and scholarship, of 
blood, sweat, tears and tons of words ex­
pended on this author. I’m finding that digi­
tal tools are allowing me to say new things, 
to see the work in a new way, and that’s true 
of my colleagues as well,” Chiodo said. “That 
in and of itself offers huge possibility.” 

Riding the elevator up through the 
stacks, I’m now hyper-aware of the “great 
unread” around me. Tracking down a par­
ticular volume of Chaucer, I feel myself 
taking part in a long tradition of skimming 
across the top of a vast reservoir of cultur­
al output. While exploring the digital hu­
manities, I’ve realized that in my past three 
years as an English major I’ve never been 
forced to truly examine the tools I’m using. 
While I may go on close reading Chaucer’s 
stanzas, I’ll do so with a better sense of oth­
er technologies of knowledge, other ways 
of seeing, that—for the moment—exist out­
side of my reach.
