Hidden behind high stone walls and a 
wrought-iron gate, Edgerton Park looks 
like a stately sentry, a signal to cars and 
passersby that they have reached the New 
Haven-Hamden town line. But on the first 
Saturday of every September, Edgerton 
becomes an inviting festival ground. The 
musicians, vendors, and exhibitors at the 
annual Connecticut Folk Festival & Green 
Expo set up camp atop the park’s grassy 
hillsides, filling it with the mingled sounds 
of folk music and children at play. 

Winding my way along the outskirts 
of this year’s festival, I take stock of the 
spectacle. To my right, a flock of unsuper­
vised children gathers around a white tent 
where a grown-up fairy princess waves her 
arms in swooping circles. A young boy at­
tempts to swivel his hips at the adjacent 
hula hoop station. The banner at the Won­
derful Worms booth invites the brave and 
the dirt-loving to plunge their hands into 
pots of worm-filled soil and learn about its 
fertilizing properties. I have found my way 
to the kiddie section of the festival: the 
Green Kids’ Village.

Beyond face-painting and free child­
care, the Green Kids’ Village exemplifies 
the festival’s commitment to education, 
founder and coordinator Coleen Camp­
bell tells me. Of the more than eighty-five 
booths populating the vendor village this 
year, approximately twenty are in a work­
shop or performance format. The commer­
cial aims of the festival are modest. Even 
vendors recognize that the most valuable 
aspect of a small-scale event such as CT 
Folk will be the customer interactions. 
Vendors are not just peddling their organi­
cally grown apples, for instance; along with 
that apple, they hand over a lesson on the 
harmful effects of pesticides. 

These lessons are passed on to attend­
ees of all ages, says Campbell: “When you 
grab kids at a young age and educate them 
in fun ways about the environment, hope­
fully they will carry on and be the next co­
ordinator of a green expo!”

Joe DeRisi, owner of Urbanminers, a 
deconstruction and salvaging business in 
South Hamden, calls this model of educa­
tion “seed planting.” The metaphor is fit­
ting: CT Folk is ultimately an exercise in 
community growth. The focus on youth 
education and community outreach helps 
create a space where likeminded commu­
nity members can meet and forge connec­
tions, laying the groundwork for a more 
cohesive and environmentally sustainable 
community.  

The sweet melodies of folk duo Hannah 
& Maggie float over a sea of white tents 
and draw me towards the festival’s central 
stage. Live music is a central part of the 
festival. Campbell explains that folk music 
and environmentalism are a natural com­
bination, harkening back to the Great De­
pression days of Woody Guthrie and Pete 
Seeger.

In previous years, the folk festival had 
been a ticketed event, featuring headlin­
ers like Judy Collins and Emmylou Harris. 
This was its second year with free admis­
sion, and a lineup of lesser-known local 
musicians. Barbara Shiller, president of 
the CT Folk Board of Directors, says, “My 
hope is that people will come to the event, 
perhaps not having heard of the musicians, 
but with an understanding that they will 
hear good music.”

In keeping with folk’s customarily fluid 
definition, this year’s festival included mu­
sical acts ranging from country-inspired 
acoustic performers like Darrel Scott, to 
soulful harmonizers like Brother Sun, to 
quick-step bluegrass numbers performed 
by Yale’s own Professors of Bluegrass, 
which includes Yale President Peter Sa­
lovey on the bass. On and off of the low-
lying, white, wooden stage, the musicians 
appear at ease with the crowds. Many are 
CT Folk regulars, and they form part of 
an intimate local music scene. Some, like 
Hannah & Maggie, are out-of-towners who 
have grown attached to the festival’s musi­
cal community. 

CT Folk is a labor of love for all involved—
Campbell, Shiller, their colleagues on the 
board, and the host of yellow-clad volun­
teers who graciously accommodate the 
needs of vendors, musicians, and attendees 
alike. Shiller invited all of the volunteers 
and coordinators to her home as a celebra­
tory thank-you, both prior to and after the 
festival. She recognizes that local events 
like CT Folk are community-building acts. 
“Whether it’s environmental activism, or 
sharing in the love of music—when you’re 
working together to make something hap­
pen, you’re part of a community.”

This hard work has brought us CT Folk 
in all its summer-day glory. Vendors and 
customers chat like old friends. Festival 
volunteers call out to familiar faces in the 
audience. In line for Ashley’s ice cream, two 
strangers strike up a conversation about a 
side business in bike repair. Musicians, fil­
tering off stage at the end of their act, find 
a spot among the scattering of picnic blan­
kets and beach chairs, blending with audi­
ence members and playfully heckling their 
musical peers. 

Stretching out into the late afternoon 
and evening, the festival stakes its claim 
on this last warm day in September, re­
minding us that there’s still time for an­
other song.
