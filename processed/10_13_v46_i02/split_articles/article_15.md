No Mirrors
in my
Nana’s 
House
by Navy Encinias
I’ve been thinking about mirrors. Mainly, I’ve been remem­
bering that, for some months not too long ago, I took it upon 
myself to have a strange daily encounter with a mirror, every 
day except Sunday. Often I’d spend several hours in front of 
the mirror in the morning, and then again in the evening. I’d 
go home and eat alone in my bedroom, and I’d fall asleep soon 
after. I’d wake up and do it again. Because most days looked 
alike, I have trouble remembering them distinctly. So I was 
surprised when I realized a few days ago that I had kept this 
ritual alive for nine months—my entire sophomore year of col­
lege. 

Mirrors provide us with an overwhelming amount of in­
formation about ourselves. That information—the clear and 
accurate image—is objective, or seems so. What I see in a mir­
ror I take to be true and assertive, and because mirrors com­
municate with rare candor and immediacy, it’s easy to grow 
dependent on them. Mirrors show you where and who you are. 
Think, for example, of the experience of sitting across from a 
friend late at night, when she’s willing to tell you something 
about you. Seeing myself through others this way has protect­
ed me on many occasions. I am uncertain of myself otherwise. 
But as soon as I began asking mirrors for something specific 
that year, the need for information became dangerous. It be­
came a quiet and desperate “I want, I want,” with an immediate 
response: the clear and accurate image.
