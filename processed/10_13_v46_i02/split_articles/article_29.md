The Week in Review
by Eric Boodman
The Fiscal Crisis Affects the Presidential 
Breakfast
President Barack Obama hasn’t tasted cof­
fee in two weeks. Nor has he put butter on 
his toast, or poured fresh milk on his ce­
real. Instead, he has been drinking a coffee 
substitute made from boiled chicory root, 
spreading margarine on his stale bread 
crusts, and pouring reconstituted milk 
onto his cornflakes. Given the government 
shutdown, the Department of Presiden­
tial Breakfasts has had to drastically scale 
back its menus. Read more
American Refugees Head to Canada
Americans are flocking to the Canadian 
border to escape what they see as a looming 
civil war caused by the government shut­
down. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen 
Harper has granted Americans temporary 
refugee status, as well as provisional ac­
cess to the Canadian socialized medical 
system. “We are happy to be able to provide 
relief to our southern neighbors,” Harper 
said at a press conference. He pleaded with 
those Americans currently camped out at 
the border to be patient while their appli­
cations are processed. Read more
Michelle Obama Announces Foraging 
Campaign
On Wednesday, Michelle Obama announced 
a program designed to teach the children of 
furloughed government employees how to 
forage for edible plants. At a White House 
press conference, she displayed baskets of 
acorns, a handful of purslane, and bushels 
of chickweed, as well as the camouflage 
rain boots that allow her to venture into 
muddier spots. “Whether you are look­
ing on the grounds of the White House, in 
your local park, or in your own backyard, 
you can bring home a free, nutritious meal 
for you and your family,” she said. The pro­
gram will begin as soon as the government 
is back in session. Read more
Congressional Republican Accused of 
Mooning Protesters
Representative Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) 
has been accused of indecent exposure af­
ter allegedly mooning protesters in front of 
the Capitol. Albert Jessny, a student at the 
Corcoran College of Art and Design, says he 
was holding up a sign that said “Stop Argu­
ing,” when Scalise came out, dropped his 
pants, and shouted, “Argue with this!”

Castro Volunteers as Interim President
In a five-hour speech delivered in front of 
Havana’s statue of José Martí, revolution­
ary leader and former Cuban president 
Fidel Castro offered to come out of retire­
ment to serve as interim president of the 
United States. “This is more than just a 
fiscal crisis—it is a crisis in leadership,” he 
shouted. “This is an opportunity to show 
the world what a real government looks 
like.” His grandson, Alexis Castro Soto del 
Valle, stood beside him, waving an AK-47.
