T
he moment I walked into the stacks 
of Yale’s Sterling Memorial Library, 
I knew it was love at first smell. The 
scent of yellowing paper reminded me of 
the library in the small town where I grew 
up. I had nearly exhausted the collections 
of that library by the time I got to high 
school, whereas I haven’t even managed to 
set foot on each of Sterling’s sixteen floors.


What to do with all these centuries 
of words, endlessly piling up on library 
shelves? Most books in Sterling are a part 
of what’s called “the great unread”—the 
profusion of books and other cultural out­
put that go ignored by humanities scholars. 
From all the novels and histories, all the 
theory and criticism published in the last 
half century, we select a relative few, cre­
ating a comprehensible, manageable canon 
out of the overwhelming possibilities.


Until now, humanities scholars have 
been devoting their lives to narrowing down 
the resources in their field. But as libraries 
like Sterling begin translating their texts 
into digital forms, scholars have begun to 
wonder whether we might be able to use 
new technologies to make use of entire li­
braries of works, rather than a narrow few. 
New computational techniques can then 
work to “read” these millions of forgotten 
texts, drawing out topics and trends. Using 
these tools, scholars in humanities and the 
sciences are partnering on projects that 
weren’t possible even ten years ago—things 
like text-mining, cultural mapping, and au­
tomated literary analysis. These new tech­
niques are part of what’s called the digital 
humanities, a discipline that is just now 
beginning to take root at Yale. While the 
movement raises exciting possibilities, it is 
also asking scholars to confront how they 
define the humanities as a discipline.


Last March, Peter Leonard became 
Yale’s first digital humanities librarian, a 
new position that signals Yale’s growing 
support for scholars exploring the inter­
section of digital technology and the hu­
manities. In his office on the second floor
