poetry
Every night, boats glide out from behind 
The island to keep an eye on the volcano
And draw its luster out, through red eruptions,
 into the sailorsâ€™ eyes, and into the water
which holds itself against the boat, 
against the island, and cools the stones
intolerable to the skin.
Lapilli falling steadily from far away
Slowly rake the night-slide of ash
to water. The water keeps time, as
Tuna are trawled in in a net between two boats.
Arm after arm, fishermen bring them to a calm place.  
On the rocks that slip below and rise out again, 
Mother walks to meet the waves
And the waves meet her with a splash and spill.
Is it enough to fill a black volcanic basin?
She descends wading deep.
The sand slopes so sharply that if she looks down,
She sees depth with no floor, 
And the island begs in the distance, 
For tall grass, brush and broom made by the moon,
Drawn by an inland wind into blue straw bales
Before dispersing like hair.
