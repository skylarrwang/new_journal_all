Zach was the owner of the blue acrylic 
constellations. I remember his glass pal­
ette, always spotless, his neat rows of small 
piles of paint, his paintings—small brown 
boxes against a blue grid, over and over 
again. His eyebrows, pinched together 
over wire-rimmed glasses, his skinny arms 
raised high, his fine fingers gripping the 
brush so hard that they turned white. I don’t 
remember him ever being happy with his 
paintings; I don’t remember any of us being 
happy with our paintings. That wasn’t the 
point. They’d hum on the walls, waiting for 
us, as we went about the other business of 
our weeks. The door swung open and shut, 
open and shut.  


Now, as I stand in the middle of the 
room, any place my eyes rest is caked 
with memory. The dented gray radiators—
spending the night here in winter, we hud­
dled in front of the heaters on the cold floor, 
sleeping lightly, then rousing ourselves to 
finish the eight, twelve, twenty paintings 
due only hours later. That pink wing-back 
armchair (sagging more, now, than it used 
to) where we would sit when we had given 
up, however briefly. 


To my left, the metal carts in which 
we stashed our lives’ trappings—artistic 
and otherwise. Teacups, warm sweaters, 
scented hand soap repurposed for brush 
cleaner. All the carts are imperfect in some 
way, whether it’s a missing wheel, a bro­
ken hinge, or a faulty latch. I know well the 
harsh screech of dragging the metal beasts 
across a concrete floor. Scraps of tape used 
to claim ownership, now effaced and cryp­
tic: “racie,” suggests one, “CRAN,” shouts 
another. Thick gobs of paint can be picked 
off the surfaces like scabs. 


Looking out over the fresh glowing 
white of the movable partition walls, the 
neatly stacked (if visibly rickety) stools, it’s 
hard to believe how quickly it can all build 
up and be taken down. Effort, frustration, 
investment, paint. Can it really be as im­
portant as it feels? Felling the trees, clear­
ing the land, building the cabin—only to be 
swallowed in a forest fire at the end of each 
semester.


That original wagon party finally 
reached the frontier and split to go their 
separate ways. Some people are making 
video work now; some are designers, some 
animators. Some have no idea what they’re 
doing after graduation this May, but they 
probably won’t be painting. As it pushes 
us out gently, the school gathers in a new 
batch of pioneers, preparing itself for their 
new architecture. We won’t be completely 
erased, though, and most likely, we will be 
back. We’ve kept our keys.
