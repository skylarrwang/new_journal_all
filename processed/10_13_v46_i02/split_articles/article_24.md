the new journal
was built to gold-level LEED certification, 
with walls made from local cedar wood, a 
geothermal heating system, and a rooftop 
garden.


Today is the new building’s grand open­
ing. In the parking lot between the school 
and East Grand Street, rows of chairs face 
a big red and yellow ribbon strung across 
the front of the center. It is still early, and 
Greg Moschetti arrives before the crowd. 
Though Moschetti is a member of the 
founding board, he doesn’t think of him­
self that way. “I would rather think of the 
original small band of Quakers in the lower 
level of the meeting house as conveners,” 
he says. “We convened a conversation that 
will continue for years and years to come, 
as the Friends Center leads the way in ear­
ly-childhood education.”


That conversation is mainly concerned 
with keeping high-quality childcare af­
fordable. Around two-thirds of the center’s 
students live in households earning less 
than the state’s median income of $54,000; 
its average annual tuition is $7706 a year. 
Early childhood education is expensive: 
the hours are long in order to accommo­
date the schedules of working parents, 
and the state mandates high caregiver-
to-child ratios. While Head Start and New 
Haven’s magnet school pre-K programs 
offer a free alternative for students from 
low-income families, spots are limited. At 
the Friends Center, parent volunteers and 
a great deal of administrative legwork al­
lows the school to calculate tuition on a 
sliding scale. The center covers the differ­
ence between tuition money and the oper­
ating costs using what Schiavone says is a 
“jigsaw puzzle of public funds, foundation 
grants, and private donors.”


As a crowd gathers in the parking lot, I 
meet Michael Anderson, an employee at the 
Peabody Museum and another founder of 
the Friends Center. He tells me that back 
when the childcare program was in the plan­
ning stage, he suggested a co-op program, 
which the other founders embraced. Every 
parent volunteers for an hour and a half 
each week, with some adjustments based 
on the number of children parents enrolled. 
Some help out in the classroom, while oth­
ers do laundry on weekends. Arie Mobley, 
a postdoctoral candidate at a neurosurgery 
lab, spends her volunteer hours serving on 
the board. Her husband, a carpenter, uses 
his skills to build furniture for the center.


In some small way, each of these par­
ents  is addressing a national call to nar­
rowing the achievement gap between 
kids from low- and high-income families. 
Across the country, studies by universi­
ties, private foundations, and NGOs point 
to early childhood as a crucial period in a 
child’s development. The Center’s efforts 
are part of a national conversation. In his 
2013 State of the Union address, President 
Barack Obama said, “In states that made 
it a priority to educate our youngest chil­
dren...students grow up more likely to read 
and do math at grade level, graduate high 
school, hold a job, form more stable fami­
lies of their own. We know this works. So 
let’s do what works and make sure none of 
our children start the race of life already 
behind.”


Moschetti envisions Quaker schools 
playing an important part in this process. 
As one of the four Quaker members on the 
school’s fourteen-person board, Moschetti 
was instrumental in shaping the school’s 
mission in its early days. He emphasizes 
that Quaker values will continue to shape 
the school, excitedly pointing out that 
there are already measures in place to re­
mind students and teachers at the Friends 
Center of their roots. Each of the classroom 
doors is labeled with a different Quaker 
value: Peace, Community, Equality, Truth, 
and Simplicity.


Many share his optimism. At the ribbon 
cutting, graduates of the original basement 
preschool stream in, as do parents, may­
oral candidates, and neighbors. Passing by 
a white press tent, they settle into seats 
set up in front of the Friends Center door. 
A large easel with lined white paper dis­
plays the agenda in large, curly handwrit­
ing. Brightly-colored buckets filled with 
scissors sit at the end of each row of chairs. 
Then a line of preschoolers, holding hands, 
emerges from the playground gate. The 
crowd quiets as they watch the children 
find their seats—right in front.

A crowd gathers to celebrate the new 9,245 square foot building. The pre-school originally 
opened in the basement of the Quaker Meeting House.
