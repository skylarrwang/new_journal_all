The title of the eighteenth-century Brit­
ish print, “The Doctor Diminishing Death,” 
seems too triumphant for the scene. Death, 
a skeleton, climbs through the open win­dow of a sick man’s room, eyeing his next 
victim: a thin, nervous, pale man. The doc­
tor, slightly disheveled in a red coat and 
breeches, points a golden medical instru­
ment at the intruder in a desperate attempt 
to stave off his advance. The patient shields 
himself with the only available object—his 
porridge spoon.


Despite its grim subject matter, the 
print, which satirizes medicine’s some­
times futile fight against nature, is meant 
to be light-hearted. In this respect, it is 
typical of the prints in the Clements C. Fry 
Collection at the Yale School of Medicine. 
The collection features prints on subjects 
ranging from mental hospitals to hypnosis. 
It spans five centuries, with works by over 
six hundred artists. Satirical British and 
French prints from the late seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries, often poking fun 
at the pain of illness or the incompetence 
of bad doctors, make up the majority of the 
collection. 


Though the Fry Collection contains 
nearly eight thousand prints and draw­
ings, its contents are squirreled away in the 
basement of the medical school’s histori­
cal library. It is open to public viewing, but 
only by request. Since the subject matter 
is unusual and highly specific, the collec­
tion doesn’t exactly draw crowds. Incred­
ible care, however, is devoted to preserving 
the objects in the dusty basement recesses. 
Alongside the labyrinth of rooms housing 
old books and prints are technologically 
advanced printers, scanners, and machines 
for turning the pages of old books, to keep 
oily fingers from touching the prints. Those 
in the know will tell you that, despite the 
aura of obscurity, the Fry Collection is one 
of the most well-known medical print col­
lections in the world.


Medical prints sound like a dusty area 
of study, but as William Hefland will tell 
you, the intersection of art and science is 
fascinating. One of the collection’s most 
prominent donors, Hefland has a back­
ground in pharmaceuticals but fell in love 
with medical art soon after beginning to 
explore it. Now a recognized figure in the 
medical print-collecting field, he spoke 
fondly of one German poster abstractly de­
picting a man as a chemical plant, a print he 
tracked down after losing it to a physician 
friend at an auction. In fact, he stressed 
that much of the prints’ worth comes from 
their aesthetic appeal—they give research­
ers less medical historical information 
than I had imagined. 


“You’d like to have illustrations of cer­
tain moments in history,” Helfand told me. 
“But you don’t.”


Much of the artwork depicts scenes the 
artists did not actually view; the satires 
twist historical facts to illustrate certain 
points. A common trope of British carica­
ture mocks the rural apothecary’s absurd 
treatment of an unsuspecting peasant with 
bizarre animal-derived products.  


To explain the niche these prints origi­
nally occupied, the collection’s curator, Su­
san Wheeler, likened them to satirical car­
toons in the New Yorker today. Many of the 
works appeared in daily newspapers, and 
others were sold in print shops as decora­
tion. A closer examination of the prints and 
drawings can reveal a time period’s con­

temporary politics and popular thought 
about medicine. Along with its humorous 
pieces, the collection also contains a wide 
variety of serious works depicting medical 
hardships. The most haunting of these por­
tray the trials of mental illness. A black-
and-white, late-eighteenth-century print 
titled “Madness” shows a young woman, 
slightly disheveled and wrapped in a shawl, 
glancing toward the viewer with a searing 
expression of desperation and horror. 


Each year, only a handful of research­
ers, if any, request access to the collection’s 
resources. They primarily use them to lo­
cate images for papers and books on rel­
evant medical and historical topics. John 
Booss, a professor emeritus of neurology 
at Yale, contacted Wheeler when searching 
for images to illustrate his book, To Catch a 
Virus. He ended up using four posters from 
the Historical Medical Posters collection, 
noting the importance of the images’ aes­
thetic appeal. Booss wrote about the his­
tory of diagnostic virology for the general 
public as well as a technical audience, and 
he needed images that would appeal to all 
readers. 


 “Medicine has become so highly tech­
nical that doctors are at risk of becoming 
highly-skilled technicians, and a great deal 
of the humanity of medicine is lost,” Booss 
warns. He sees art as a powerful way for 
scientists to speak to the general public, 
if those scientists can realize it; although 
many of its individual prints satirize the 
grotesque, dehumanizing aspects of ill­
ness, the Fry Collection may bridge the gap 
between doctors and the general public. 


Though there are few visitors, the me­
ticulous preservation of the art allows 
researchers to present this side of medi­
cine. Work like Booss’s helps bring hidden 
prints, if only a fraction of the thousands in 
the Fry collection, outside the dusty base­
ment doors.
