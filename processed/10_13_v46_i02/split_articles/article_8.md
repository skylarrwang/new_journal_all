“This is half a lung.” Mark Michalski held up 
a twisting piece of plastic, one inch thick, 
to his chest. To me, it looked like roots on 
the underside of a tree, with small white 
tendrils poking through brown mesh. This 
was one of Michalski’s first attempts to 
create customized plastic models of human 
organs. 

Michalski is a fourth-year resident at 
Yale-New Haven Hospital. Over the past 
year, he has been making plastic replicas 
of body parts using the machines at Yale’s 
Center for Engineering Innovation and 
Design (CEID), an engineering workshop 
space located on the bottom floor of Becton 
Center on Prospect Street. The CEID pro­
vides materials, tools, and advising for any 
Yale student who signs up to be a member. 
One such tool is a 3D printer. It works like 
a regular inkjet printer, but rather than de­
positing one layer of ink on paper, it depos­
its many layers of material, usually plas­
tic, to create a three-dimensional object.  
Michalski converts patients’ medical data 
into instructions for the printers at CEID, 
which then produce plastic models unique 
to each patient. 

What started as a pet project is mor­
phing into a technology that could revolu­
tionize surgery and, more importantly to 
Michalski, help doctors communicate with 
patients about their diseases. Aside from 
the lung, his recent projects include a frac­
tured pelvis, a diseased kidney, and a can­
cerous prostate.

As a radiologist, Michalski spends his 
days looking at MRI and CT scans of the 
insides of people’s bodies, analyzing these 
scans to diagnose diseases and plan treat­
ments. In his office, Michalski used his 
laptop to show me a 3D skeleton with a 
fractured pelvis. He rotated the skeleton 
with a computer mouse, highlighted vari­
ous bones, and opened 2D slices of the 3D 
model. Staring at the screen, I felt nowhere 
near the real thing, an operating room 
where a surgeon would manipulate a pa­
tient’s pelvis. 

“3D reconstructions give you some 
great data,” Michalski said. “But…for a lot 
of populations who are not radiologists”—
he lowered his voice—“even within the ra­
diologist community, frankly, there’s value 
that comes from being able to hold [the or­
gan].” So he looked into 3D printing at the 
CEID. He created his first model on a low-
end 3D printer, which is about the same 
size and twice the price of a new MacBook 
Pro.

“It all started on that MakerBot right 
there,” Michalski told me, pointing to the 
printer. Within a wooden frame, a small 
black box moved back and forth along met­
al rods, squeezing out plastic like glue from 
a hot glue gun. This machine had printed 
the root-like lung Michalski had shown me 
earlier. While Michalski and I spoke, two 
other students watched the MakerBot spit 
out a custom iPhone case.

About a year ago, Michalski was print­
ing a version of the lung when his project 
caught the attention of Joseph Zinter, as­
sociate director of the CEID. Zinter and Mi­
chalski started talking about the concept 
and they were soon partnering to advance 
the work of 3D printing. Zinter has since 
put hundreds of hours into the project and 
established a special fund for organ print­
ing at the CEID. The two have discussed 
points of departure


potential applications for this technology, 
including educating medical students, in­
forming patients about their conditions, 
and helping surgeons prepare for compli­
cated procedures.

This last idea has already been put into 
practice. Joseph Turek, chief of pediatric 
surgery at the University of Iowa Chil­
dren’s Hospital, has been using 3D-printed 
models of hearts for almost a year. They 
help him finalize his strategy and gain con­
fidence for performing surgery when the 
stakes are much higher. “When I go into the 
operating room, it’s the exact same thing 
that I’m seeing,” Turek said. 

This summer, Michalski printed a can­
cerous knee for an orthopedic surgeon at 
Yale. While preparing for surgery, the sur­
geon put the model on his desk, took out 
his surgical tools, and determined the best 
way to excise the tumor without damaging 
the surrounding area. The model allowed 
him to practice technique without conse­
quence.

These 3D printing projects now take up 
most of Michalski’s time. But in addition 
to his residency, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in 
investigative medicine at Yale. “I have no 
idea if you can write a thesis on this sort 
of thing,” Michalski said. “But I think it’s 
interesting enough”—he corrected himself 
—“important enough, that I’ve got to do it.”

The models’ educational and surgical 
applications are significant. But Michalski 
is primarily drawn to this work because it 
could better inform patients about how a 
disease affects their own organs. Holding a 
model of your liver when you have been di­
agnosed with a tumor gives you a concrete 
sense of what that means.  

“The story, for me, won’t end until I’ve 
used this technology to make patients un­
derstand better what’s going on inside their 
body,” Michalski said. “If we can print new 
bracelets and trinkets with these [print­
ers], then we can print meaningful objects 
for people who are really undergoing the 
battle of their life.”
