On August 24, scandal struck St. Thomas’s 
Episcopal Church on Whitney Avenue: a 
lamp was stolen. In an interview with the 
New Haven Register, church rector Father 
Michael Ray announced a reward and a 
no-questions-asked return policy for the 
small, silver, Victorian lamp that had hung 
above the church’s altar for more than 
twenty years. The lamp’s absence was felt 
“like a hole,” he said.

The story of the lamp’s arrival at St. 
Thomas’s is steeped in community lore. 
Every parishioner I spoke to repeated the 
basic story as though he had heard and told 
it hundreds of times. About twenty-five 
years ago, a pair of now-deceased sisters 
paid for the lamp to be sent from Italy (or 
some other distant country, depending on 
whom I asked) and placed over the altar in 
honor of their brother, who had recently 
passed away. Whether lit by candle or elec­
tricity, the lamp had shone in the sanctu­
ary ever since.

The church’s property manager, Ju­
lie Kelly, was preparing to place a fresh 
eight-day candle into the lamp when she 
first noticed its absence. She made fran­
tic phone calls, “hoping against hope” that 
someone had taken it down for cleaning. 
Each call ended in disappointment, and she 
quickly realized that it had been stolen. 
Kelly describes herself as more “security-
minded” than St. Thomas’s leaders, who 
prefer to emphasize openness and trust in 
the church community. But she was proud 
to say that the violation of trust would not 
cause the church to shut itself off from the 
world. 

“People who come here for worship re­
ally have an expectation of safety in so 
many ways,” Kelly told me. “We want to 
be careful without putting up these giant 
barriers to people. That’s just the constant 
conflict.”

When I arrived at the church at 8:45 
on a Sunday morning in September, there 
seemed to be no sign that anything was 
missing—except people. The sparsely at­
tended eight o’clock service had already 
ended, and worshippers had not yet begun 
to assemble for the next, and more crowd­
ed, ten o’clock service. But the church doors 
were wide open, and the sanctuary was 
lit with sunshine filtered through stained 
glass windows. 

Outside, Sandy Anagnostakis, a small 
and elderly woman, was removing the 
spent flower buds from a rhododendron 
bush. The work wasn’t necessary, she told 
me, but it looks nicer this way. Reverence 
for the church’s physical space easily ex­
tends to the objects it houses—even those 
that strike outsiders like me as quotidian. 
Anagnostakis has been a member of St. 
Thomas’s for eight years, and she was at 
church the Sunday after the lamp was sto­
len. 

“It was quite a shock to all of us, because 
it was such a part of the background beau­
ty of the church,” she said, still picking off 
flower buds. Beyond the shock, the circum­
stances of the crime struck congregants as 
particularly odd. The thief left behind two 
silver candleholders, which are likely more 
valuable than the lamp and were easily ac­
cessible on tables at either side of the altar.

I had gone to St. Thomas’s expecting to 
find lamp zealots angrily calling for police 
to organize a statewide search of pawn­
shops. Instead, I found congregants seem­
ing to apologize for their sadness at the 
loss of a material object. At the first service 
without the lamp in a quarter of a centu­
ry, the church congregants prayed for the 
thief—that he or she had been able to use it 
to relieve a pressing need for food or mon­
ey, and had found emotional solace.

When I finally met Father Ray, the rec­
tor in the Register’s article, I was slightly 
disappointed to find that, despite his col­
lar, Ray looked much more like a harried 
businessman than I’d pictured. Glasses sat 
on his round head, which was topped with 
salt-and-pepper hair, and his voice still 
bore traces of a childhood spent in central 
Texas. He recalled there was more to the 
lamp’s journey to St. Thomas, aspects of its 
story which sounded even more miraculous 
than what I had heard from the congre­
gants. Though paid for by the sisters, it had 
originally been discovered in a flea market 
by Father Ray’s predecessor, who bought it 
when it was grimy and seemed of little val­
ue. When the rector paid to have the lamp 
cleaned, he found that it was made of ster­
ling silver. 

But the lamp’s monetary value is not 
what made it important. When Father Ray 
became rector, he had the electrical wiring 
taken out of the lamp and replaced with 
a candle, which was always lit, symboliz­
ing eternal hope. Over the years, the lamp 
became part of the identity of the phyical 
church, and of its community.

“A lot of what we feel is tied up with 
spiritual and emotional senses that are dif­
ficult to describe,” Father Ray said. “I don’t 
know how else to describe it. We know it’s 
not an important thing in the whole realm 
of issues.” 

As if to convince himself, he repeated, 
“It’s not important.”
