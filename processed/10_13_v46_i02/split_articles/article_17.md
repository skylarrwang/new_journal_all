EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
they’ve lost the sense that their bodies be­
long to them. Obedient now only to music 
and the direction of their keepers, their 
every movement is the consequence of a 
balance serendipitously struck long ago, 
when they were deemed beautiful chil­
dren. After growing up disciplined, they 
earn a career, one in which they are wo­
ken up to rehearse, then again to perform. 
Their artistic skill is called, by many, “in­
terpretive”—that is, at the whim of what 
they interpret. They work hard, but their 
work has the look of ritual. Watching those 
dancers is like watching objects suspended 
in midair, fragile because they’ll soon fall. 
Regardless, it’s beautiful. I’m not quite sure 
what I envied, but I think it was everything. 
Dancers are called 
narcissistic, 
because 
they’re 
obsessed 
with 
the beauty of their own 
image. 
But 
beautiful 
dancers are no longer 
obsessed, per se; their 
beauty and talent is the very water they 
swim in—a banal and constant reality. 
Those obsessed are those of us in desperate 
need to see ourselves in the mirror and find 
the reflection a certain way. Narcissism is 
hardly the word: there is no erotic interest 
or latent egotism, no pleasure in the act of 
reflection. It is, more simply, a consuming 
aspiration, a sort of unhealthy relation­
shi—a dependence on a mirror that will 
never give you what you ask of it. It took 
me awhile to understand it, but eventually 
I think I did: it’s the dependency that devel­
ops when you love something, and it simply 
won’t love you back. If you are lucky and 
beautiful—if dancing somehow does love 
you back—the mirror is no longer useful to 
you. You get that look in your eye; you earn 
a career. Even after you fall and retire, you 
carry the look with you. 
Around that time I decided to become 
an art history major. The work was a fa­
miliar, even convenient exercise, and I 
wasn’t ready to challenge myself more 
than I already was. It required looking at 
images and interpreting what I saw. I was 
more successful the more exacting I was, 
the more I demanded out of what I looked 
at. Most of the time, I neglected that work 
and performed it on myself instead. Such 
an intense and sustained look at your­
self isn’t healthy; it doesn’t improve you 
and it isn’t what we’re at school to do. But 
by nature, I’m a very willful dreamer, and 
the situation complicated when a ballet 
teacher told me I had enough talent to quit 
college and dance full-time. Who knows if 
it was true—but I looked harder at myself 
regardless, and willfully called that look­
ing a dream. A few weeks later, I couldn’t 
move my right leg at night. Sometimes I’d 
black out for seconds at a time; I think from 
nerves. I remember now 
that when I’d return to 
consciousness, I was usu­
ally looking at myself in 
a mirror—in a bathroom 
somewhere, or standing 
in front of the full-length 
in my sophomore suite.  
One day, I did the reading for seminar 
and found some help in it. It was an essay 
on Édouard Manet’s “Un bar aux Folies 
Bergère,” by an art historian named T.J. 
Clark. Manet paints a barmaid attending 
her bar. Everything in the painting takes 
on the quality of a reflective surface. On 
display and for sale are a bowl of a shining 
clementines and two roses in a vase, liquor 
bottles with modern labels, and presum­
ably, the barmaid herself. She shows a pa­
tron the fleshy insides of her forearms, and 
there’s a bunch of flowers collected at her 
cleavage. She has an eerie, almost glassy 
look in her eye. We get an overwhelming 
amount of information, however, from the 
framed mirror behind her. In its reflection, 
we see the sheer enormity of the Folies-
Bergère—the lurid, electric lights, the hun­
dreds of people, a trapeze artist swinging 
overhead. Amid the bustle, the mirror also 
captures a quiet exchange. The barmaid 
leans forward to her patron, in a delicate 
performance of femininity and supplica­
tion. The reflection shows one barmaid, 
servile and attentive—and yet her eyes sug­
gest another, hardly servile and hardly at­
tentive. It seems she’s forgotten where she 
is. 
“A mirror is a surface on which a seg­
ment of the surrounding world appears, 
directly it seems, in two dimensions,” Clark 
writes. “As such it has often been taken as 
a good metaphor for painting.” The mirror 
may be a device that flattens, but it never 
fixes. Unlike painting, the segments of 
the world that a mirror captures are never 
rendered permanent. What’s flattened and 
framed by the mirror is always flickering 
and variable—subject to immediate and 
constant change. Clark continues, “there 
is literally nothing behind the barmaid 
but glass,” and he’s right. It’s just a piece 
of glass. He goes on to say that “there is a 
plain fact of vision somewhere” and, frank­
ly, I wonder where it is. I wonder if, in all its 
plainness, the fact of vision is ever satisfy­
ing. 


I kept asking the mirror for the plain 
and the factual, the immediately satisfying, 
and it never came. What’s most frustrating 
now is that, as many times as I looked at 
myself in the mirror that year, not one of 
those sustained stares still belongs to me. 
They’re lost now, or I’ve misplaced them. 
I have a large mirror in my bedroom this 
year, but I can’t find them there either, and 
maybe it’s best that they’re missing. Instead 
I have a few pairs of ballet slippers left and 
a drawer of practice clothes. They’re black 
and well-worn, and I cherish them now as 
surviving relics from a bad time. 
My grandmother and I had a conversa­
tion about it all one afternoon, and I cried 
about it for the first time. She made a few 
promises: that even though I never trusted 
the mirror to show me so, that my body 
is strong and beautiful. She told me that 
this trouble was bound to come, but that it 
has passed. She promised that tomorrow 
I would wake up and remember that I am 
who I am becoming, and not who I am in 
the mirror, and maybe not a dancer at all. 
There was nothing immediately plain or 
factual about what she said, but for some 
reason, I’ve been better ever since.
