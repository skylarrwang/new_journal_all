The card reader glows a prohibitive red. 
It is barely September, and Yale’s campus 
is poised on the brink of the new semes­
ter. The clusters of graduate students who 
will soon clog the front steps of the build­
ing, smoking their menthols or scraping at 
Styrofoam pad thai containers with plastic 
forks, are nowhere to be seen. Green Hall 
is still waiting for its occupants. Coming 
in from the hard light of Chapel Street at 
noon, I pass through double glass doors 
into the cool dark of the atrium.

The painting studios are on the second 
floor, and I take the stairs with a rhythm 
now familiar to me. Usually, most of these 
rooms are locked, but today the heavy met­
al doors are flung wide open. The whole 
place feels atypically loose, and peaceful. 
The soles of my shoes crack the quiet, send­
ing an echo into the corridor as fluorescent 
lights flicker on to mark my way.

I note with satisfaction that Room 211, 
at least, is locked. I fish my key ring out of 
my bag and feel around for a thick brass 
talisman, with “AZHU” printed on its head. 
I know the right key by its weight in my 
hand, and the door unlocks with a familiar 
schhckk. Room 211 is empty—it’s the early 
days, still. The last early days I’ll experi­
ence here. I’ve come back to be comforted; 
I want the space to fold me back in. I need a 
constant, something I can count on.

The room is dead quiet and barely rec­
ognizable. Light streams in from the win­
dows spanning the facing wall, and sets a 
bleached glow over the room. It looks unbe­
lievably clean—like the walls have renewed 
themselves over the summer, shedding a 
mottled skin for a newer, glistening one. 
After the door slams shut behind me, 
211 seems more familiar. Stepping clos­
er to the walls, I see faint evidence of the 
room’s recent past: paint that the sum­
mer maintenance crew has failed to to­
tally erase. Here, a dripped line of red; by 
the window, a constellation of blue acrylic 
spattering that I can trace to a friend’s 
practice in the autumn of our sophomore 
year. The floors are a complex map of past 
work. The oldest colors have been scrubbed 
down into the concrete, losing all but the 
very last of their character. Other stains 
look just-spilled. I try to parse the blots of 
color for their associations—a distinctive 
purple that another friend is known to fa­
vor; that blood red, that time I cut my foot 
on a broken oil bottle and the blood went 
everywhere (and how it looked like paint). 
The first semester of my freshman 
year, I enrolled in my first painting class 
in 211. I took to the rhythm of the studio 
immediately—settling in for multi-hour 
marathons, balancing my dinner on the ra­
diator. It was a lonely semester, with few 
of the other students intending to be art 
majors. They came to class, they left. They 
didn’t seem to feel the gravity of the room 
so strongly. The next year, however, I found 
my people. We felt like pioneers, building 
our shelter in Green 211.
