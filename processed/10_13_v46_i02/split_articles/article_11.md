Vast gray clouds roll across the sky, shield­
ing New Haven from the morning sun. In 
the center of Yale’s Cross Campus a tall 
metal chair waits, six folding chairs ar­
rayed in front of it. A student emerges from 
Calhoun College, his hair spiked, a cigarette 
dangling from his lips. A ponytailed runner 
jogs by, and dozens of under-caffeinated 
students plod to class. The day will bring 
class discussions, email breakups, and 
drunken dances—imperceptible struggles 
and unrecognized victories.

Just past nine a.m., a young man hold­
ing a thick paperback approaches the chair 
and sits. The reader opens the book and re­
gards his audience of one. He begins: “Anna 
Karenina. By Leo Tolstoy. Chapter One: All 
happy families are alike; all unhappy fami­
lies are unhappy each in their own way. All 
was confusion…”

The reader is a junior named Eric Sira­
kian, and he is the first participant in a mar­
athon reading of Anna Karenina that will 
span the next thirty-six hours. The reading 
project is co-sponsored by the Humanities 
department and the Dramat’s production 
of Anna in the Tropics, a play in which Cu­
ban immigrants in a cigar factory listen to 
the story of Anna Karenina in 1929. The 
work earned a Pulitzer for its author, for­
mer Yale School of Drama professor Nilo 
Cruz, in 2003. Sirakian directed the play at 
Yale in early October, but wanted the pro­
duction to extend beyond the theater.

“The play and the novel are connected,” 
he said. “It’s a play that really celebrates 
storytelling and the power of stories to 
take us away from the manic world and to 
understand ourselves more closely.”

As he reads, Sirakian wears a plain gray 
shirt and black pants, a far cry from the 
fine riding gear of Anna’s lovers. But he 
reads the opening passages smoothly, with 
muted theatrics, stumbling only occasion­
ally over the long Russian family names 
and patronymics. 

In time, several other students take 
seats opposite the reader’s chair, and ac­
cidental spectators stand nearby, drawn 
by the strangeness of it all. They key in to 
the epic story of love, family, society, and 
betrayal in nineteenth-century St. Peters­
burg. Kerry Philben, the next scheduled 
reader, arrives with her dog, a yellow lab, 
and waits for her turn to bring Tolstoy’s 
Tsarist Russia to life. Soon, she takes over 
for Sirakian, picking up where he left off 
with an impressive Russian accent. An­
other undergrad named Javier Cienfuegos, 
outfitted in a bow tie and blazer, taps his 
foot beneath his chair as he anticipates his 
turn. When he takes the stand, he starts 
describing Oblonsky’s goal to take all the 
pleasure he can out of life; meanwhile, 
some tourists and their microphone-clad 
leader come by and threaten to overwhelm 
Tolstoy with their oblivious chatter.

People mostly pass by in a rush, too 
busy to listen as Anna falls for the dash­
ing Count Vronski, imperils her marriage 
to Count Karenin, and abandons her young 
son for the sake of a doomed love affair. 
Was Yale shunning Anna as surely as St. 
Petersburg society had?

Yale’s campus is a poignant place for 
Anna to be brought to life; mere blocks 
from the reading, Tolstoy’s son Ilya lies 
buried in the Grove Street Cemetery under 
a black slate headstone that depicts the 
crucifix of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
The younger Tolstoy moved to Connecti­
cut just before the Russian revolution. He 
established an artists’ colony a few miles 
from campus and spent the rest of his life 
there. Although many of the world’s most 
eminent writers, including Nabokov and 
Dostoyevsky, have called Anna Karenina 
the greatest novel ever written, Ilya main­
tained that his father hated the work and 
wished it had been burned.

For thirty-six hours, a devoted group 
of readers immerse themselves in its lan­
guage and setting, and in the passion of its 
protagonists. Virgil Blanc, a junior who has 
never read the book, spends more hours 
than any of the other volunteer readers 
narrating Anna’s tribulations. Wrapped in 
a fleece blanket to ward off the cold, Blanc 
reads for five straight hours, from two to 
seven a.m. “I wanted to see the transfor­
mation of reading aloud after five hours 
of doing it,” said Blanc, who isn’t a stranger 
to testing his endurance, but usually does 
so with marathon runs and bike rides. “I 
couldn’t see what happened to the listen­
ers, but I could see what happened to me.”

For much of the night, Blanc is alone. 
He grows closer to the work. As the char­
acters suffer, so does he. As they weep, his 
tears flow, too. Close to four a.m., a student 
returning from a night of revelry stumbles 
across the scene and listens for a few mo­
ments. “Right on, man,” he says, nodding his 
head.

The sun rises. Another night falls. The 
sky is dark and clear. With no classes beck­
oning, students amble across campus. It 
is Yale’s family weekend, and many have 
parents in tow. Anna’s life shatters as she 
moves from Russia to Italy and back, as she 
morphs from bored wife to reckless lover 
to social outcast.

What matters is not how many people 
listen. Tolstoy’s words, read aloud, bring 
Anna’s anguish, foolishness, and mistakes 
to the center of campus. Even as our hero­
ine, falling from grace, hurls herself under 
the wheels of a train, she lives.
