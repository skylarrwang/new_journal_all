No one cries over spilt milk at the Friends 
Center for Children. The Tupperware has 
tops there. Everyone always remains calm.

A small boy reaches for the Puffins ce­
real and frozen blueberries sitting in the 
center of a low table. He pours them into a 
neon yellow bowl, and turns to three other 
boys at the table. They watch their peers 
stack blocks, curl up with books, and fiddle 
with puzzle pieces. Then one boy reaches 
for the Lazy Susan and gives it a whirl. Con­
tainers of milk and raisins are upended. 
Fluorescent cutlery goes flying.

What looks to be a playtime mess is 
part of an attempt to clean up early child­
hood education in New Haven. The Friends 
Center for Children, a progressive Quaker 
pre-school in Fair Haven, began with four 
children in a basement and today edu­
cates more than seventy toddlers and in­
fants in a new state-of-the-art facility. The 
9,245-square-foot building was completed 
just this year, but is already well on its way 
to serving the community.

When the center first opened in 2007, 
local families with young children were 
severely underserved. New Haven Mayor 
John DeStefano had formed a group of 
early childhood educators, administra­
tors, and community leaders to develop 
an education plan for the city’s youngest 
children. With over a third of children un­
der the age of five living below the poverty 
line, low-income families were the focus of 
their discussion. When the Friends Center 
announced its decision to expand to a K-8 
school, representatives from the city urged 
a different direction. According to board 
member Greg Moschetti, many approached 
the board with the same plea: “Please, 
please take care of our babies.”

In 2009, they embarked on a campaign 
to build a new home for the center. The 
school needed a space that could allow for 
growth but still maintain the sense of com­
munity and intimacy that had led families 
to line up on their waiting list. The Quaker 
congregation donated a plot of land behind 
its building to form what would become 
the independently-run Friends Center for 
Children. After a three-year wait, Connect­
icut approved a $1,750,000 bond to fund 
the center’s construction in June of last 
year. Work progressed quickly over the 
spring and summer; the children watched 
backhoes and frontloaders move in and out 
of their backyard. 

On the September morning that I arrive 
at the center, all is quiet, the cacophony 
of construction now absent. An unassum­
ing wood and glass façade peeks out from 
behind the dark brown, two-story Quaker 
meeting house. The obtuse angles and met­
al paneling of its roof distinguish it from 
the quaint twentieth-century mill houses 
on the street. The building, I learn later,
