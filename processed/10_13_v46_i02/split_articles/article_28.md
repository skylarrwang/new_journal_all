term ends. At the September 24 meeting, 
Erik Johnson invited interested residents 
to be part of a steering committee that will 
champion the presented Church Street 
plan. “When Kelly [Murphy] and I aren’t 
here and other people aren’t around, we 
want to make sure that there is a commu­
nity voice.” The plan will go before the city 
planning commission on November 20. “We 
want you to come with us to talk about our 
plan,” Johnson says to the assembled com­
munity members. “After we go to the plan­
ning commission, we are going to take this 
to the Board of Aldermen in December…
We would like you to be there.”


Many aspects of the Hill to Down­
town plan could change over the fifteen to 
twenty years it will take for the Downtown 
Crossing project to be completed. But just 
by agreeing to remove Route 34, the city 
has shown that it believes that New Haven 
can be a better and more livable city. I re­
call Shanequa’s words: “They need to hurry 
up and do it.”


Past the treacherous highway over­
pass, I thread east through the park behind 
the Knights of Columbus tower, to the site 
where the New Haven Coliseum sports are­
na  stood from 1972 until the city imploded 
it in 2007. The Knights of Columbus tower 
casts a shadow over the sweeping parking 
lot. In the future, this lot could be entirely 
transformed as part of the Hill-to-Down­
town projects: a developer hired by the city 
submitted a design featuring a town square 
with apartments, restaurants, and top-of-
the-line wine shops; later plans include a 
luxury hotel and a corporate office tower. 
The estimated cost of the project is $250-
$350 million.


After the meeting, Chris Soto says of 
the plan, “In their scheme, you see a ho­
tel. You’re also seeing a lot more activated 
streetscape. The folks on the street aren’t 
just walking by businesses, it’s more stop­
ping and looking and whatnot.”


Many details of the Coliseum develop­
ment would be out of place in a develop­
ment at Church Street South, where resi­
dents are hoping for grocery stores. But it 
evokes a style of city life that the designers 
think Hill-to-Downtown district could as­
pire to: a place where people can live, work, 
and play. A revitalized Church Street, if 
executed well, could be just as lively as 
the architectural designs. People could be 
excited to gather and to walk down in the 
new Main Street. Instead of living among 
the ghosts of a once-vibrant neighborhood, 
residents could find a place to call home.
