The dirty parking lot of CMHC hardly seems like 
the ideal location for a Friday farmers’ market. But 
for the past three years, from July through September, 
the CMHC parking lot has been filled with white tents 
selling farmers’ fresh-off-the-vine bulging eggplant, an 
explosion of kale and lettuce, and the still-wafting smell 
of this morning’s fresh-baked bread. As it turns out, 
the parking lot is actually the ideal place for a farmers’ 
market, for a number of reasons.


The market makes financial sense for the hospital 
administrators. The cost is minimal—City Seed, a New 
Haven nonprofit, sets up the farmer’s market in the 
CMHC parking lot without hospital funds. Additionally, 
for the Connecticut Mental Health Center Foundation—
the nonprofit that provides supplemental, donated 
funding to CMHC—the farmers’ market is actually a 
moneymaking venture. Donors love everything about 
the farmers’ market—it’s environmentally friendly, it’s 
beautiful, and, as of late, it’s trendy. Since setting up 
the farmer’s market three years ago, the foundation 
has actually seen an increase in donations. They 
attribute this to their strategy of donor outreach, which 
highlights efforts to promote a “wellness” culture in 
the hospital—a holistic approach to health that doesn’t 
focus on weight loss but rather on the individual as a 
part of a community.


It all sounds very nice, especially when you throw in 
the live musicians every week and guest-star appearances 
from a bike repairman, patients selling crafts, and—most 
memorably—an equine therapist. The farmers’ market’s 
possible impact on the community is a large selling point 
to donors also. The idea is not just to change the food 
culture at CMHC, but in the Hill as a whole.


Normally, it would be hard for patients and the 
surrounding community to afford to shop at a farmers’ 
market. But City Seed has introduced a program to accept 
food stamps for double their stated value at the market, 
and the CMHC foundation funds the distribution of 
coupons to CMHC patients, which gets them additional 
produce for free.


According to patients, this financial inclusivity 
created a unique social environment. “You get to interact 
with the higher-ups, the doctors, the administrators,” 
Spruill said. “You don’t normally get to do that.”


These social interactions are not just selling points 
for donors, however. They have real clinical benefits. 
“Keeping people coming to their appointments is a 
tremendous problem for us,” says Dr. Michael Sernyak, 
CMHC’s director. With the arrival of the farmer’s 
market, patients started keeping their appointments in 
order to get coupons. Clinicians even began to see better 
appointment attendance on Friday mornings, compared 
to the rest of the week.

“If weight loss is your outcome of interest, a lot of 
people are going to be very disappointed. Most people 
won’t succeed,” Sernayk said. “We want to avoid that 
disappointment. We want to start engineering success to 
begin with. If we focus instead on walking a little more 
or eating better, people might start to lose weight.” But 
that’s a big “might.”


At this point, there have been no success stories 
among CMHC patients.  In fact, the only person to lose 
significant weight at CMHC has been its director—and 
Sernyak didn’t lose weight by just walking around the 
block. 


When he came to the hospital three years ago, 
Sernyak was on the brink of obesity. “I weighed in at 226 
pounds. I’m a physician, so I know how this story ends. 
I don’t want to be in the best shape of my life after I’ve 
had my first heart attack.” He started counting calories 
on his iPhone, buying more fruits and vegetables, eating 
breakfast, and exercising—a lot. He often spent an hour 
and a half on the Stairmaster every day. In eight months, 
he lost over sixty pounds. To keep up his new body, 
Sernyak bikes a few hundred miles a week. He also keeps 
a treadmill in his office, so he can walk while working. 


Sernyak does realize that his method wouldn’t 
work for many of his patients. “If I’m a single parent 
with a kid, I can’t disappear for five hours on a bicycle 
ride. And because I have enough money, I can eat really 
good food that’s good for me.” Losing weight is just 
plain hard, even with all his advantages, he says. Despite 
these caveats, Sernak remains confident that eventually, 
a patient will overcome the challenges of losing weight.


“There will be one or two people who succeed, and 
you never know who that’s going to be. The changes 
for most people may not be dramatic, but small weight 
changes can make a big difference in peoples’ lives.”


For Spruill, healthy eating and exercise are spiritual 
practices. She wants to be healthy and alive for as 
long as possible, so that she can fulfill what she sees as 
her mission to help those around her.


“It’s part of my spiritual involvement to go into 
somebody’s life, affect them in a positive way, and then 
move on,” she says, fiddling with the cross on her neck. 
“It’s like the ripple effect.”


Between Spruill’s strong sense of motivation 
and the aid of CMHC, she is set up for success, but 
something is standing between her and what she wants. 
“I grew up very poor,” Spruill explains. “We would 
usually eat one or two meals a day. I didn’t even know 
what lunch was.” She and her twelve siblings ate healthy 
things—beans and rice and oatmeal, and even vegetables 
from the garden before Spruill’s family moved from 
North Carolina to the Northeast. But they ate lots of it. 
Enough to be very full, especially since sometimes they 
would have to go two or three days without food.


“That’s why I can’t stand to be hungry,” she 
said. “I can’t stand that gnawing feeling still, and that 
goes way back to when I was a kid, dealing with hunger 
as a child.”


People’s relationships with their bodies run 
deeper than what numbers can convey. Even though 
Spruill has a lot of support and aid—regular visits to a 
nutritionist, money to buy healthy food, and a moderate 
exercise regimen—her past remains with her. 


For now, the hospital’s obesity problem remains 
more or less the same as it has been since clozapine 
came on the market in 1990.


“Things are changing, it’s coming,” Spruill said. But 
whether or not her optimism will ultimately lead to the 
numbers going down at CMHC—on the scale in the 
wellness center, or in the nearby emergency room—
remains to be seen.
