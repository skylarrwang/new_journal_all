Osuman Imoro’s opponent was examining the 
blood streaking down his left elbow when 
Osuman stepped into the right-hand server’s 
box of the squash court and struck a loping serve. In 
the third game of this best-of-three match, Osuman, 
14, was spent, his skinny chest pulsing with heavy 
breaths he would prefer you didn’t notice. Restless and 
self-effacing by nature, Osuman asserted himself on 
the court, searching his opponent’s wearied steps for 
a lapse and responding with returns as graceful as they 
were unforgiving. Osuman’s earlier shot, a low, lining 
dagger driven inches off the floor, had drawn blood; his 
competitor, Mason Corbett, skinned his elbow diving 
onto the wooden floor after it. Now Osuman rushed 
to line up the next point before 
Mason could recover. Mason 
reached backwards for the return, 
and they rallied for a bit until 
Osuman suddenly caught a lazy 
ball on his racquet. He thrashed 
it off the court’s side wall at such 
an angle that it ricocheted into 
the front wall, and then towards 
the back left corner of the court. 
Mason, whose riskless shots were 
a lawyer’s answer to Osuman’s 
frenetic flow, pursued it with 
labored steps, but the ball beat 
him and now he was heading 
towards the wall too quickly to 
pull up. Mason crumpled into the 
corner, on the floor for the second time, while Osuman 
leapt in anticipation of a return into the court’s center, a 
place that equals power in a sport that prizes positioning.


For much of that December morning, Osuman 
and his team, Squash Haven, looked out of place in 
the Kneisel Squash Center at Hopkins School, an elite 
New Haven preparatory school. Squash teams from 
private high schools warmed up on five of the center’s 
six glass-walled courts, their players sporting wavy 
hair and bright bandanas. A team from a school called 
Kingswood-Oxford, wearing dragon-themed uniforms, 
completed drills on a court named for David Swensen, a 
Hopkins graduate and Yale’s Chief Investment Officer. 
An elegantly outfitted mother toting coffee in one hand 
and a copy of the New York Times in the other arrived 
to hand her son two new squash racquets wrapped in 
plastic.


Gathered in their own four-walled court were four 
black and three Hispanic boys from Squash Haven, a 
program that teaches select low-income students from 
New Haven public schools how to play squash. Their 
sweatshirts didn’t have brand names. Instead of drills, 
they practiced trick shots. Later, with the team on its 
way to a third place finish, one Squash Haven student 
studied the tournament’s “ladder,” or rankings list, with 
a green afro pick. From a distance, he seemed to be 
rearranging the tournament’s hierarchy.


As Mason and Osuman began their match, one 
of Mason’s Kingswood-Oxford teammates seemed to 
echo the thoughts of many in the room when he asked 
about Osuman, “Do you know who that kid is?” In 
a sport confined in America largely to white, wealthy 
Northeasterners, Squash Haven’s poor black and 
Hispanic players are outsiders. Like a growing number 
of 
urban 
squash 
programs 
nationwide, Squash Haven counts 
on the sport’s association with 
money and prestige to connect 
its students to elite colleges and 
high-paying jobs. But old barriers 
are slow to come down. Does the 
collision between squash clubs 
and public housing—between 
Mason, who took daily summer 
lessons at the Hartford Golf Club, 
and Osuman, whose Ghanaian 
parents have never seen him 
play—really make opportunities 
multiply?


As we watched Osuman, 
Derek Lawrence, a fifteen-year-
old Squash Haven player, told 
me that members of the squash community expect him 
to be on a basketball court. “It feels good to puzzle 
them a little bit.” In the match’s pivotal third game, 
Osuman was puzzling them. Squash, a sport in which 
two bodies jostle for position in a tight, four-walled 
space, rewards players who capture the court’s center, 
and penalizes those who unfairly manipulate the court 
space. If one player interferes with the other’s path to 
the ball, it’s called a let, and the point is replayed. If one 
player interferes with the other’s direct swing on the 
ball, it’s called a stroke, and the person whose shot was 
blocked wins a point. Osuman lorded over the court’s 
center, striking winners that hit three walls before they 
landed at Mason’s tired feet. Mason searched for a 
reassuring nod from his parents and coaches. Osuman, 
who doesn’t let his parents attend matches because they 
make him nervous, kept his eyes locked on the game’s
