kind of questions to ask on a school tour, the cultural 
differences in how kids are socialized to advocate for 
themselves and ask questions of authority,” as factors 
that silently undermine underprivileged families. Squash 
Haven teachers aren’t shy about pressing upon their 
students manners that serve as indicators of social and 
educational status to the outside world. Students were 
eager to look me in the eye and introduce themselves 
formally when we spoke. That’s because the program 
asks them to shake the hand of and make eye contact 
with every Yale student volunteer they encounter.


Squash’s seemingly stale rules seem to cultivate a 
kind of respectful comportment. Players are expected 
to incriminate themselves if they commit a violation on 
court, like hitting a ball on a double bounce. They also stay 
at their court after they compete to serve as referees for 
the next match, calling violations like lets and strokes for 
their peers. Jon Zonis, a lawyer and squash player whose 
family organizes yearly Squash Haven fundraisers, said 
the sport’s demands on poise and fitness teach players to 
find resolve in moments of vulnerability. “It’s so much 
about staying level and staying calm. Being confined 
in that little box with people behind the glass looking 
at you and being the master of your own destiny—it 
teaches you about being on your own.”


Like youth squash, American collegiate squash was 
once exclusively the domain of white, wealthy 
families. But it has a different face today. Many of the 
top teams’ rosters are made up of athletes from Asia and 
the Middle East, where squash is played at a higher level 
in part because it’s popular among the middle and lower 
classes. Paul Assaiante, whose dominant Trinity College 
roster often doesn’t feature a single American, said the 
rise in overseas recruiting upset Greenwich families that 
invested a lot in squash. “It created a bit of a kerfuffle,” 
he said. “‘Why is Johnny being denied the number one 
spot because you’re opening the door to a kid from 
Malaysia?’”


Urban squash programs are responsible for a similar 
demographic revolution in youth squash. Assaiante calls 
the advent of urban squash “by far the greatest change 
in the world of U.S. squash in the last ten years.” He said 
that just as American tennis has improved as the sport 
spread to black athletes, urban squash promises to make 
the U.S. more competitive internationally. “Some of 
these urban squash kids are brilliant athletes.” After the 
Junior Championships, Osuman became the country’s 
no. 21-ranked under-fifteen player. Many urban squash 
players who go to boarding schools, like Kingsley, are 
quickly recognized as the best players on their teams.


But just as Assaiante’s stars endured taunts for 
taking spots on teams from Americans, Squash Haven 
players sometimes absorb insults at junior tournaments. 
Greenwood told me about a time last year when some 
of her students had “a hugely nasty experience” at 
a tournament at Wesleyan. As usual, players were 
refereeing their peers’ matches. In this match, a Squash 
Haven player had seemed to interfere with his opponent, 
but the Squash Haven student who was refereeing chose 
not to call the play a let. Parents from an opposing team 
exploded. Greenwood said they didn’t seem angry about 
a simple missed call. The parents seemed angry that an 
outsider to their sport had gotten in their kid’s way. One 
parent followed a Squash Haven player out of the center 
and verbally assaulted at him in a hallway. Another wrote 
to the tournament director that she would never again 
let her children play in a tournament with Squash Haven 
kids.


Elligers said her students are familiar with barriers 
to opportunity in a city with obvious class divides. 
“They’re hit with failing public schools and Yale in the 
same place. They see it. They know it.” She said Squash 
Haven staff members, all of 
whom are white, don’t hesitate 
to discuss issues of unequal 
opportunity on which students 
might otherwise be silent. The 
program’s six high school juniors, 
the first Squash Haven class to 
be preparing college applications, 
recently handed Elligers report 
cards showing grades as low as 
Cs and an F. Alarmed and upset, 
she put aside Shakespeare’s Much 
Ado About Nothing, the topic of that day’s lesson, and 
opened up a Fiske Guide to Colleges. She showed them 
that their grades weren’t yet within range for their dream 
schools. Then she asked her students to picture their 
high school civics class. Six out of the class’s twenty 
students wouldn’t graduate, based on statistics for New 
Haven public high schools. Of those who graduated 
and enrolled in college, one in five would finish within 
six years. The rates were lower for blacks and Hispanic 
students. That left three future college graduates in the 
twenty-person civics class. “I don’t know about you all, 
but it’s gonna be me,” one student quipped, but the 
harsh message had sunk in. Students couldn’t afford 
to get complacent. They had two semesters left to beat 
long odds that even eight years of enrichment classes 
couldn’t fully wipe clean.


Seneca Cox-Uhlan, a short, thick-bodied eleven-
year-old who is Squash Haven’s only white student, 
told me one day after his academic session that there 
was something I needed to put in my magazine. It 
was something he had never before told anyone about 
Squash Haven. “Teachers at school are paid to be nice to 
students,” he confided. “Here, they’re not paid. They’re 
just plain nice.”


Squash Haven’s teachers, of course, are paid, but 
it’s revealing of their unconventional methods that their 
students aren’t always sure. Elligers said, “We’re all up 
in there. We’re in there with their family stuff and we’re 
in there with school stuff, grade stuff, money stuff, sex 
stuff.” Staff members give kids rides home and estimate 
that they answer thirty texts a day from students. They 
know whose younger brother has a fever and whose 
mom works the night shift. They hear when family 
relationships turn sour and are helping one student’s dad 
find a job. When a ninth grader quit Squash Haven and 
later got pregnant, Elligers, Greenwood, and DeWitt 
visited her at the hospital every day. Elligers later went to 
her home a few times a week to help her change diapers 
and do enrichment homework assignments.


The staff’s immersion is 
not only necessary to smooth 
over everyday challenges for 
kids of limited means. It’s also 
an essential part of the social 
contract for a program promising 
to build a bridge from the projects 
to 
Payne 
Whitney. 
Squash 
Haven challenges students’ low 
expectations, expectations that 
serve as defenses against past and 
future failed promises. In their 
place, Squash Haven plants the idea that with its help, 
students can go as far as they’d like to: up the squash 
rankings and into Yale’s glossy halls. If Squash Haven’s 
promise to tear down barriers turns out to be an illusion, 
the disappointment can be lasting. Kids go back home 
having tasted life on the other side, more convinced than 
ever that they’ll never be allowed in. Squash Haven is “all 
up in there” because fighting systematized prejudices 
requires nothing less.


When I first asked Osuman if I could visit him at 
his home, he said no, explaining with a shrug that 
his dad worked late. Osuman seemed to want to keep 
his home life, which he said could get noisy with seven 
siblings, separate from his life on the squash courts. He 
later complained about a New Haven Register reporter 
who had called him for a recent article and expected him 
to open up right away. “I wasn’t ready for that,” he said. 
“People I don’t see too much of I don’t feel comfortable 
with. I was about to play squash and they just called me.”


After two or three tries, Osuman finally relented 
and told me I could visit. On a chilly December evening, 
I walked to his home on Goffe Street, just three blocks 
from Payne Whitney Gym. It stunned me that I’d 
considered calling a cab. Only three blocks separated 
the U.S. Squash Hall of Fame from a dark road with 
boarded storefronts.


Osuman’s dad, Yousef Imoro, greeted me at the 
door as five tiny children between the ages of eight 
months and six years gathered at his feet. Osuman was 
staying late at squash practice, like usual, but Imoro 
welcomed me. His small row house was barren of stuff 
and filled with people. Osuman’s siblings climbed over 
the couch and onto Imoro’s arms as we spoke. Imoro 
emigrated from Ghana twenty-one years ago. Five years 
ago, his wife and Osuman joined him in New Haven. 
Imoro now works sixteen-hour days at a Toyota body 
shop, and his hands were thick and worn. He seemed 
animated by the same barely-contained ebullience as his 
son.


Imoro recounted an evening a week earlier when 
he heard Osuman rip open a letter and start screaming 
in the kitchen. “Na Gode Allah!” Osuman had yelled, 
‘thank you God’ in Hausa, the family’s native Ghanaian 
language. “Na Gode Allah!” When Imoro came 
downstairs, Osuman told him that he’d earned a spot 
at an upcoming tournament in Boston. “I hope he will 
do well,” Imoro said. “That’s my prayer. I know he will 
do well.”


Imoro told me he brought his family to America 
because their opportunities in Ghana were limited. 
“I want my children to go ahead more than me,” he 
explained. “Because I didn’t get the chance.” He said he 
hoped one day Osuman “might become one of the best 
stars, a Yale star. That’s something we wish. And maybe 
we all achieve the dream.”


I asked Imoro what sort of dream Squash Haven 
represents to him. His two-year-old daughter Adiza was 
sneezing into his arms. “It’s like right now I was sitting 
some place and somebody just came and said, ‘Well this 
is two million dollars. Take it and use it for something.’ 
That’s what Squash Haven represents.” He continued: “I 
thank God for that. I thank the coaches and thank all of 
you for your hard work.”


“I didn’t do anything,” I laughed in protest, figuring 
that he had mistaken me for one of the Yale volunteers 
who helped out.


“Yeah, but at least you walk and come to my 
house, he said excitedly, his voice rising, now practically 
booming through his hollow house. He insisted: “It’s 
something. It means a big thing.”


Imoro’s son, five years off the plane from Ghana, 
was twenty boys away from being the best squash player 
in America at his age. He harbored dreams of going pro 
in the country clubs’ sport; if not, Elligers was already 
plotting his college admissions strategy. In the unlikely 
collision between white, wealthy Americans and poor 
Ghanaians, where the support of the squash elite met 
the resilience and ingenuity of the underprivileged, 
Imoro saw the heavens spark and two million bills fall 
into his worn hands.
