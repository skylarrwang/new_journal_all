the roads of the dead need names at all. The bevy of 
different architectural styles—obelisks, sculptures, 
bare granite blocks—I found almost too much to look 
at. As I walked further, however, the organization 
of the cemetery started to make more sense. In 
Greek mythology, the mapping of the underworld 
is never for the benefit of the dead—it is for the 
living, so that we may make sense of what awaits us. 


The Grove Street Cemetery’s design made it a 
tourist attraction. By 1833, its fame was such that writer 
B. Edwards could claim: “And who has not heard of the 
beautiful cemetery of New Haven? It has been theme of 
more frequent praise among us than any other receptacle 
of the dead, save only Père la Chaise.” In this now-
forgotten era, the Grove Street Cemetery was intended 
to serve as a public park, open to visitors and tourists 
and couched in a sense of spectacle and grandeur. 


As its reputation grew, it became a thoroughfare for 
foot traffic and subject to vandalism. In response, a large 
wall was erected around the cemetery in 1845, funded by 
a group of concerned New Haven citizens. They chose 
to build with stone because it would be more soundproof 
and lasting than the cheaper wood. The enclosure was a 
formalized exclusion of the space of the dead from the 
space of the living. As I walk, these layers of removal 
reroute cluttered musings, and the wall’s exterior 
quiet results in a corresponding stillness of thought.


Whenever I’ve visited the cemetery, it has been 
empty. I’m not complaining—silence and solitude were 
the reasons I entered the cemetery in the first place. But 
I’ve also become fascinated by its unusual history and the 
stories it contains. Today, the cemetery winnows down 
distraction; it calls attention to simplicity. Away from 
the distractions of the outside world, the emptiness of 
the cemetery orders the chaos of my thoughts. As I 
walk through the cemetery, thinking about its history 
of distance and detachment, a similar movement of 
dislocation occurs in my mind. Here in the cemetery the 
structures of life persist, uninhabited. In the absence of 
other living beings, I forget about myself. In his poem 
“Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven,” Lee Edelman 
puts it perfectly: “Lost stories fill the ear’s one room/
with other rooms—all empty, room on room—/
while widths of sound, blown open, rise like paper.”


The strange paradox of this place concerned with 
removal and separation, however, is that it remains a 
spot of attraction for the living, a place of bringing 
together various pasts. It is neither a bustling tourist 
destination nor an empty Victorian ghost-haunt, but 
some combination of the two—a place where one 
can go to be alone and quiet, a place where one can be 
surrounded by a rich and far-from-silent past, or both.
