action. His slim, lithe body darted around the court with 
less grace but more exuberance than his opponent’s. On 
match point, Osuman flicked an unexpected shot into 
the court’s left corner. Mason retrieved it, but stumbled 
back to the center of the court late, and found himself 
in the path of the approaching ball. Osuman wound 
up to swing, then suddenly had to pull back to avoid 
hitting Mason. It was a stroke. Match point to Osuman. 
In a building built with the money of Greg Kneisel, a 
Goldman Sachs executive, on a court whose glass walls 
wished its occupants happiness and good fortune in 
Latin (“QUOD FELIX FAUSTUMQUE SIT”), the boy 
out of a Hartford golf club was disqualified for getting 
in the way of an inner-city boy from Ghana.	 	


T
he program that brought Osuman to Hopkins on 
that December afternoon, Squash Haven, offers 
after-school tutoring and squash instruction to seventy-
nine fourth to eleventh graders from New Haven. The 
students, mostly black and Hispanic and evenly split 
between boys and girls, gather every afternoon with 
a group of coaches and tutors to train in squash, get 
help on their homework, and try more advanced reading 
and writing exercises. In the short term, the program 
promises athletic and academic enrichment. In the long 
term, it reaches for more ambitious targets: admission 
for its students to boarding schools and elite universities, 
and access to rungs of the socioeconomic ladder that 
might otherwise seem out of reach.

This unusual education takes place at Payne 
Whitney Gymnasium, Yale’s nine-story Gothic cathedral 
to athletic extravagance. The gym features 21,000 square 
feet of workout space, two large swimming pools, 
and Squash Haven’s office—a converted closet space, 
now painted in shining green. Squash Haven students 
practice in the seven million dollar Brady Squash Center, 
one of the world’s preeminent squash facilities, whose 
fifteen courts include the only exhibition court in the 
U.S. with four glass walls. The Squash Haven team 
meets in a room tucked at the end of a long hallway in 
the Brady Center that doubles as the U.S. Squash Hall 
of Fame. Students work on poetry assignments in a 
carpeted trophy room displaying worn footballs from 
1902 and a statue of a discus thrower. One afternoon, I 
found fourth-graders sitting on the edge of the room’s 
stately leather chairs as they snacked on clementines and 
prepared for a vocabulary bee. 

Julie Greenwood, Squash Haven’s executive director, 
explained that the program’s goal is to give students 
access to elite schools and squash tournaments from 
which they’ve traditionally been excluded, and to help 
them develop tools to succeed there. If students raise 
their grades and get good at squash, the thinking goes, 
they might join a squash team at a prestigious university. 
At the very least, they’ll build the skills to expand their 
worlds beyond struggling public schools and desperate 
city streets.

Yet squash seemed to be a sport that protected a 
thin slice of wealthy, white, privilege from lower classes. 
Codes of clothing and manners insulated private school 
families from plucky outsiders. Non-marking squash 
shoes, two racquets, and a pair of goggles total $390. 
Access to a squash court alone costs around $3,060, 
the yearly price of membership at the New Haven 
Lawn Club. The most ambitious training programs 
offer lessons from top pros, summer training camps in 
Europe and Asia, and help navigating college squash 
recruitment at yearly costs of between $25,000 and 
$40,000. Is this really the right backdrop against which 
to be teaching kids from New Haven how to raise their 
grades, transcend broken homes, and trust people?

Paul Assaiante, head coach of the perpetually top-
ranked Trinity College squash team, had similar concerns 
when urban squash programs like Squash Haven were 
first developing. Assaiante grew up in a poor community 
in the Bronx, and knew from experience how strange 
and inaccessible squash seemed from the outside. “Why 
would you choose squash?” he asked of these programs. 
“When the students’ time is done—let’s say they don’t 
get into college—they would never join a private club or 
see squash again. Squash seemed like an unlikely partner. 
Why not basketball or soccer?”

Assaiante’s concern, it seemed, was twofold. 
Building a bridge from New Haven public schools 
to Payne Whitney was a project with extraordinary 
possibility. But it also threatened to leave students whose 
futures didn’t include squash or college feeling like a 
rug had been pulled out from under them. Assaiante 
also worried that urban squash programs had doomed 
their messages of learning and self-improvement by 
connecting them to a sport to which its students would 
likely lose access after high school. Tutoring and support 
programs everywhere struggle with the need to make 
their lessons applicable across environments. Why risk 
further marginalizing those lessons by attaching them to 
a context as foreign as squash?

Osuman may have been an equal of his private 
school opponents on the court, but he was still treated 
differently on the sidelines. After his win, his opponent 
Mason walked over to the area where Squash Haven 
players had gathered, waiting to congratulate Osuman. 
Weary-eyed and embarrassed, he leaned towards 
someone in the group and muttered, “Nice game, man.” 
But Osuman was not in the group. The black kid Mason

congratulated, Moubarak Ouro-Aguy, was not the black 
kid with whom Mason had spent thirty minutes on the 
court. “I think he can’t see after this game or something,” 
Moubarak joked later—but not lightly.


I
f the squash community’s obvious privilege can 
sometimes clash with New Haven students’ more 
immediate needs, the unfamiliarity of its surroundings 
also seems to help students imagine themselves anew. 
Moubarak’s sister, Rafi Ouro-Aguy, 16, arrived in 
America from Togo five years ago with her dad, sister, 
and two brothers. Last year her dad lost his job at a 
gas station after back surgery, and the family makes do 
without a car or phone. When I asked Rafi what made 
her want to play squash, she remembered the first time 
she saw Moubarak at Squash Haven. “I saw him on the 
court and I was like, ‘Who is this? 
I don’t even recognize him,’” she 
said. “That’s what I like about 
squash. When you’re playing 
squash, you’re a different person.” 
Where I saw an imposing class 
divide, Rafi recognized a blank 
slate. Squash offered her hope 
in part because it existed so far 
outside the typical boundaries of 
her experience. “You don’t get the 
feeling of the player transforming 
into another person with other 
sports,” she told me.

Moubarak looked different 
to Rafi in part because of the squash court’s bright lights 
and glossy walls. But the sport’s emotional landscape, 
just as foreign as its physical, contributed to Moubarak’s 
transformation. As Rafi tells it,  “My brother was a 
pretty quiet person. But here, everyone was cheering for 
him and I was like, ‘Oh my god. That’s so much love he’s 
getting. I want some of that.’” Rafi said nowhere else 
at school or in her community could she count on that 
kind of support.

Rafi recognized that squash was a game mostly 
populated by white people, but said it wasn’t a new 
experience to feel excluded. What mattered was whether 
or not she was given a chance to correct the imbalance. 
“Squash is squash,” she explained. “It’s not a different 
game for different colors.” 

Despite its barriers, it’s a game that can give the 
strong-willed a shot at unseating squash nobility. On 
March 15, the Brady Squash Center hosted the U.S. 
Junior National Championships for the top thirty-two 
players in each age group. Malaysian, South African, and 
Egyptian pros counseled their pupils and recruited new 
clients. Scouts from Brown and Princeton strolled the 
hallways; Yale’s coach made a girl’s nervous face glow 
when he told her he’d liked watching her play. This 
wasn’t a tournament for the merely proficient. This 
was where the upper crust came to get crowned. And 
Osuman Imoro was not only participating—he was also 
being honored as the under-15 most improved player for 
his explosive rise from no. 231 to no. 23 in the national 
rankings. “It feels like I’m proving myself,” he told me.

Osuman lost quickly in the tournament’s first 
round, but continued to the consolation bracket the 
next day, where he faced Ryan Murray, the sixth-ranked 
fourteen-year-old. The thought of Ryan’s older brother, 
a dominant Harvard squash recruit, worried John 
DeWitt, Squash Haven’s coach. “Osuman’s never played 
a kid like this,” he said before the match. Sure enough, 
Osuman couldn’t get a shot past 
his fitter opponent, faltering at 
the end of long rallies. Osuman 
lost the first game, 11-4.

Down 6-8 in the second 
game of the best-of-five match, 
Osuman slipped pursuing a drop 
shot, then unexpectedly rose and 
hit a cruel cross-court winner on 
his next shot. Suddenly Osuman 
became the aggressor. He rushed 
to line up serves and hit winners 
even as he stumbled. He fought 
to a 16-14 win, and won the 
next game 11-7. Ryan looked 
perturbed. Osuman, perpetually mismatched in yellow 
Asics shoes, blue shorts, and a black shirt, wore an 
expression of quiet resolve; when I asked him later what 
had been going through his mind, he said only that he 
“was trying not to think too much.” In the last game, 
Osuman shouted proudly as he surged to a 7-4 lead. He 
didn’t allow his opponent another point, winning 11-4.

After the match, Ryan left the court, leaned his 
hand against a wall, and started to cry. His coach patted 
him on the cheek, and soon his mom and sister joined. 
Osuman’s supporters were almost as shocked. “I can’t 
believe he beat that kid,” DeWitt said to no one in 
particular. Forgetting his usual reticence, he continued 
emphatically: “That was real. That was real.”	 	


O
suman’s wasn’t just a feel-good win. It was a signal 
that he could compete with anybody. Christi 
Elligers, a firm, freckled woman who serves as Squash 
Haven’s academic director, told me those wins teach 
students not to assent to a power structure that ranks 
people by inherited wealth and privilege. “I’m bringing 

I saw him on the court and I 
was like, “Who is this? I don’t 
even recognize him.” That’s 
what I like about squash. 
When you’re playing squash, 
you’re a different person.

something to the table and I’m going to be able to beat 
your ass,” she imagined her students thinking. Elligers 
was raised in a working-class home by a single mother 
and had never heard of squash before she joined Squash 
Haven. “A kid like Osuman walks in with his head high 
because he can. They might have a monetary advantage 
on him, but they got nothing when they step on the 
court.”

Squash Haven students are also making strides off 
the court. Eighty-three percent of the program’s high 
school students have reached the New Haven Promise 
scholarship’s benchmarks—a B average, forty hours of 
community service, and ninety percent attendance— 
guaranteeing them at least partial funding for college; 
only ten percent of students city-wide meet those 
marks. Six team members were admitted to private day 
and boarding schools on scholarships and with Squash 
Haven financial support; four are on the honor roll. 
One of those students, Ashley Sanchez, 15, started her 
freshman year at Westover, an all-girls boarding school 
in Middlebury, feeling homesick and unprepared. “It 
was like a new world.” She worried what her squash 
teammates thought of her; they’d all gone to private 
schools before and didn’t struggle in classes like she did. 
But during the transition, Ashley said Squash Haven was 
“like a second home.” Greenwood and Elligers took her 
out for dinner on an unannounced visit and told her she 
needed to get her act together. Ashley has raised her 
grades and was recently elected a “Spirithead,” or leader 
of the school’s spirit week.

Elligers said simply welcoming students to Yale can 
lend affirmation to their more quotidian achievements. 
Just like beating an elite squash player encodes bigger, 
hidden victories than the squash win alone, hanging 
‘A’ exams on the wall of a classroom in Payne Whitney 
carries more significance than an exam posted at another 
after-school program. It’s a stamp of recognition from 
an institution that might otherwise be seen as off-limits. 
Elligers said, “We’re building kids who aren’t afraid of 
the world.”

Y
ale’s temple to athletic excess is hardly the most 
unfamiliar place Squash Haven students spend time. 
They frequently stay overnight at the homes of Squash 
Haven supporters during out-of-town tournaments. 
Maryellen Feeley, a Squash Haven board member from 
Greenwich, took players on their first boat rides on the 
Long Island Sound when they visited her home. “They 
end up in towns that they didn’t know existed, seeing 
houses of a size they didn’t know existed,” Elligers told 
me. “They say Green-wich.”

Bringing New Haven students to visit elegant 
mansions can seem an unlikely learning experience. 
Elligers said Squash Haven staff is aware that the trips 
might look to students like implicit arguments for fancy 
cars and two-parent homes. “The danger of the model 
is that there’s a huge disparity between the served and 
the servers.” Students might idolize the lifestyles they 
observe, forgetting that traditional family structures and 
upper-class consumption habits don’t need to be part of 
their future plans. Greenwood recognized the hazards 
of combining Squash Haven’s lessons with exposure to 
upper-class settings. “I hope the message that our kids 
get is not that this needs to be my world, but more that 
I am getting the skills to choose where I want to build 
my life.”

Carlos Briones, 11, realized his homestay family 
living near Wesleyan was rich when he went into the 
home’s garage. “They had mad Nerf guns. Buckets 
of ammo.” When I asked him if his visit taught him 
anything, he parroted the simplified version of Squash 
Haven’s mission—“If I work hard and study, I can one 
day be like them”—but offered a sweeter vision of what 
“like them” might mean: “I could buy the people around 
me nice stuff.”

Kingsley Amoako, 17, was part of the Bronx urban 
squash program City Squash before entering Canterbury 
School, a private boarding school in Connecticut where 
he is the top-ranked singles player. He stayed overnight 
with City Squash supporters during a recent tournament 
at Wesleyan and was stunned by his luck: the father 
was an alumnus of St. Lawrence, the school to which 
Kingsley was in the process of applying, and also worked 
at Goldman Sachs. He told Kingsley, who hopes to work 
on Wall Street, that he would help him get an internship 
at the firm if he got into St. Lawrence.

Greenwood is a toned, sprightly woman who traded 
her job as head squash coach at Williams College to lead 
Squash Haven. She explained: “The opportunities that I 
know about as someone who went to a good liberal arts 
college and grew up in a nice suburb are far different 
than the opportunities that our kids and families are 
able to access.” But connections alone don’t bridge 
the gap. Some Squash Haven students’ families can’t 
speak English and don’t have Internet access or a car. 
“Access is not simply about telling someone, ‘Here’s 
an opportunity. Okay, go for it,’” Greenwood said. She 
works to anticipate the points at which families might 
lose out on opportunities because of circumstantial 
barriers. Then Greenwood and her staff guide families 
through them, helping students access applications and 
taking them on school visits for interviews.

The least visible barriers can be the most disruptive. 
Greenwood cited “the cultural capital in knowing what
