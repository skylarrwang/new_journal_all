movie I talked with Maulin’ Brando, one of the Shock 
Exchange’s first players. “God, we were awful,” he 
recalled. During their first games, is team could barely 
skate, let alone race. “Now we are all doing tricks and 
skating backwards. It’s amazing how far the sport has 
come in such a short period. I guess we knew we were 
bad. We were judged against this template that women 
had already established.”

While women’s roller derby has sped to underground 
fame and even broken through to mainstream culture 
with derby-themed episodes of The Bachelor, CSI, What 
Not to Wear, Top Chef, Psych, and Bones, men’s derby still 
lags behind. Most of the guys seemed happy enough 
watching the briefer and more obscure history they had 
lived, even though most of the scenes with the Death 
Quads had been cut. 

But Skatebreed seemed disappointed. The team 
had made a bit of money selling snacks and admission, 
but it wasn’t the turnout he hoped for. I was one of the 
few people there who wasn’t a derby player already or a 
friend of the Death Quads. “We’ve kind of struggled,” 
Skatebreed said. “It’s really rough actually.” 

The night’s event was largely uneventful. No 
recruits had signed up. It seemed to Skatebreed that the 
men’s roller derby revolution wasn’t happening unless it 
was played before a TV audience. Worrying about funds, 
recruits, exposure, he seemed to miss the point. 

The men of the Death Quads, businessmen and 
engineers, had already achieved a slice of roller derby 
glory. I’d seen it at the first practice, in the flashes of 
Death Quad skates, humming across the polished maple 
floor of the RollerMagic Roller Rink.

and you’re falling, going whichever way gravity takes 
you.” He chuckled at the thought, the way you do in 
daylight, as you remember details of a baffling dream.
I 
met Welts again the following Friday in Fair Haven 
at Channel 1, a tiny showroom and gallery within 
a former swimsuit factory. The Death Quads had 
organized a screening of This is How I Roll, a documentary 
on the struggles men’s derby has faced for recognition 
equal to their female peers. The guests milled about, 
chatting and sipping Narragansetts beneath a projection 
of a Death Quads game against the Magic City Misfits 
from Florida. Skatebreed hoped the event would raise 
funds for tournament travel and attract new recruits.
The Death Quads are currently the thirteenth-best 
men’s team in the world, their identity caught in limbo 
between all-star team and beer league. On one side is 
Crashasuarus Rex, who joined in 2010 after a lengthy 
search that took him through road cycling, mountain 
biking, jiu jitsu, and mixed martial arts. He describes 
himself as “competitive” and says he plays to win. A 
former college athlete, Rex is still young and attractive, 
the kind of guy who would look good smiling on the 
winner’s podium. But the team’s founders are an older 
group whose bodies often can’t keep up. One of the first 
recruits, Pastor of Muppets, has been benched while he 
recovers from stomach surgery.
Welts ended the replay of the game (which they 
eventually had lost) to cue  the movie. “I don’t have 
floor lighting or anything like that,” the Channel 1 host 
said. “If you’re afraid of the dark… hold somebody’s 
hand.” The documentary focused on the men of 
the Shock Exchange, whose captain was scheduling 
matches before he had even drafted a team. After the
