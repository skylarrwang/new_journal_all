Derby
Dreams
By Christopher Peak
A fringe sport goes mainstream, and now 
the boys come out to play.
“C
all me H.G. Welts,” he said, extending a 
hand. “That’s my skater name.”
	I was in a strip mall parking lot to 
catch a ride to Sunday night practice with the Death 
Quads, the men’s roller derby team from the suburbs 
of Connecticut. I had learned of them from a flyer at 
a vegetarian restaurant in New Haven. “Join the roller 
derby revolution,” it said in golden characters. The 
team’s logo was a goateed man, attired like a soldier 
in the trenches and raising a single fist. The fine print: 
“Men 18+” and “Primary Insurance REQUIRED.” 
Welts did not look like the athlete I’d expected, 
much less one to embody his sobriquet. He was 5’10”, 
175 pounds, and entering middle age. His hair was still 
sprouting in curly black tufts, but wrinkles lurked at the 
corners of his eyes beneath his glasses. He seemed closer 
to vegetarian than brute, as did his girlfriend, Metal 
Malady, who was waiting patiently in the passenger seat 
of the gray SUV. 
Welts joined the Death Quads last spring. Metal had 
been skating with the local girls’ team, CT Roller Girls, 
since July 2011, when the sport was still almost entirely 
female. Welts often tagged along—he wanted to learn to 
skate. Lacking a full roster, the men of the Death Quads 
constantly asked him to come to their practices. “As soon 
as I can let go of the wall,” Welts always responded.
“I’m just sitting around at a desk on the computer 
all day,” he told me. Welts is a civil engineer, designing 
and overseeing construction of water mains, storage 
tanks, sewer pump stations, “basically anything that takes

Anyone could cherish what 
Welts loves about derby: 
the speed and smoothness 
of  revolutions in the rink; 
the mystical vibration of  
another man’s shoulder 
crashing into your ribcage; 
the familiar ache of  
exhaustion.
water to your house or takes waste away, we’re doing it.” 
He’d been working at the same company for nearly two 
decades, and wanted a physical outlet. Welts decided to 
see what roller derby was all about. 
To the uninitiated, a roller derby bout seems like a 
nonsensical blur, a mob jostling each other around the 
track. The bout is divided into rounds, called “jams,” that 
can last up to two minutes. Each team has five players 
skating at once, four blockers and a jammer, who scores 
points for every opposing blocker he passes. 
Some escape the nine-to-five 
routine with tropical vacations; 
others get involved in charity. 
Welts takes to his skates. There 
is nothing surprising in this.

ache of exhaustion.
Like Welts, the majority of 
the Death Quads’ first skaters 
joined 
because 
of 
women. 
Some 
coached 
or 
refereed 
women’s bouts, but more often, 
a boyfriend wanted to  participate 
in the game that obsessed his 
girlfriend. Modern-day roller derby began as a feminist 
revival of a sport dating to 1935, when twenty-five co-
ed teams competed in a month-long race that simulated 
the distance from Los Angeles to New York. By 1973, 
the sport had all but died, dropping its athleticism for 
scripted violence. Derby reemerged sporadically through 
the ’80s and ’90s, with added spectacles—one variation 
had alligator pits—but derby as it’s practiced today was 
resurrected in a bar in Austin, Texas, in 2001. In little 
over a decade, the sport has exploded into 1,100 female 
teams. 
Men’s roller derby—sometimes condescendingly 
referred to as “merby”—began in 2006 with the 
founding of the Dirty Dozen from Northampton, 
Massachusetts, who faced the New York Shock 
Exchange in their first match in 2007. Bonnie Thunders 
of New York’s Gotham Girls led the feminist charge 
against men’s intrusion into what she referred to as “our 
sport,” saying that men needed to create their own sport 
or play one of the dozens they already had. Since then, 
she’s “evolved” on the issue, largely because she needed 
co-ed support to bring roller derby to the mainstream. 
The Gotham Girls and Shock Exchange now scrimmage 
once a month, and the Men’s Roller Derby Association 
now has thirty-one member teams, including Southern 
Discomfort in London and Mont Royals in Quebec. But 
roller derby is still far from achieving equality between 
the sexes. The Death Quads, the fourth men’s team in 
the world, draws few fans compared to the team they 
practice with, the CT Roller Girls. The Roller Girls have 
two full travel teams and three more for home games, 
while the men can barely fill out a single team roster.

As the sky at dusk darkened to a bruised 
purple, 
we 
arrived 
at 
the 
RollerMagic 
Roller 
Rink 
in 
Waterbury for coed practice. The 
place was a time capsule of 1970s 
trendiness. Geometric murals 
wobbled on the walls, dimly lit by 
a web of pink, yellow, and white 
neon tubes on the ceiling. The 
worn blue carpet swirled with 
green eddies and snakes, looking 
like hard swampwater; arcade 
games floated precariously atop. 
Dante, one of the men, said the 
floor pattern has been the same 
since he was five. The pimply 
teenagers behind the full-service 
snack bar were finishing their 
shifts and clocking out—literally. 
One by one they punched their 
cards on an old-school machine, one that some of the 
skaters might have been familiar with from their own 
adolescence. In the middle of all this, the large skating 
rink looked timeless, its polished maple gleaming faintly. 
The Death Quads are coached by a short but 
stunningly musclar woman named Pearl Jammer. She 
ordered the men and women onto the rink to run laps 
and Circle Jerk, a founder and co-captain, led the pack. 
He looks like what you might expect from a guy who 
willingly dubbed himself Circle Jerk: he ran barefoot, 
pink-and-yellow hair almost as fluorescent as the neon 
lights above, hoop earrings dangling from his lobes. 
When he first gathered a group in 2008, it was the 
fourth men’s team in the world. C.J. wanted the team 
to be called the Circle Jerks, until the other captain, 
Skatebreed, objected. An assistant at a banking firm and 
now the team’s president, Skatebreed then adopted a 
name from a local group of punk musicians, the Death 
Squads, dropping a letter to match the sport’s four-
wheeled quad skates. C.J. and Skatebreed fit the sport’s 
older demographic, guys too old for contact in lacrosse 
and ice hockey who still wanted a team sport, or maybe 
skateboarders who had never played on a team but now 
wanted a chance.
Pearl Jammer led the group through highkicks, 
lunges, squats, grapevines, and an exercise involving 
primordial crawling across the floor. By the time they’d 
finished with pushups, the guys were sweating. The 
women popped up, ready for more. After another lap, the 
two teams put on their skates, protective helmets, elbow 
pads, kneepads, wrist guards, and mouth guards.
Girl Fawkes, the men’s team manager, sat on a 
tabletop wearing Pokémon hot pants over stockings. She 
skates with the Stepford Sabotage (a group self-described 
as a meeting of Betty Crocker and Betty Ford), the top 
women’s travel team. She says the men have had difficulty 
recruiting new members. 
Roller derby has changed rapidly over the last few 
years as the sport’s governing boards experimented with 
new rules to improve the emerging sport. Their efforts 
have been successful: roller derby now sometimes makes 
it into a newspaper’s sports section, rather than lifestyle. 
Some high-profile skaters talk of one day playing at the 
X Games, maybe even the Olympics. But roller derby’s 
founders are pulled between competing interests: they 
want the sport to gain an audience and respect, but they 
don’t want to lose their punk origins by going mainstream. 
“I still love that I get to play this really offbeat sport,” 
Fawkes said. “Before roller derby I did not do anything 
athletic. I was a poetry-club, film-student, read-a-book-in-
the-dark geek. I do not want to skate and get hit. But it 
was just entrancing.”
Folsom Bruise (real name Laurie Lawless, a roller 
derby name in its own right) had skated over to ask 
Fawkes about her wheels. Folsom said she was the same 
way: athletically challenged. “I didn’t play anything in 
high school. I partied a lot. This is pretty much the first 
time in my life I’ve done anything competitive,” she said. 
After she got her life together in college, Folsom worried 
she would regress without the structure of school. But 
there was roller derby. “Roller derby saved my soul,” she 
said. “In a weird way.”
The guys practiced a few more drills for the next 
week’s match in Albany, working on their offensive 
blocking. Pearl Jammer called them over. “Be there by 
four,” she said. “We are in maroon.”
The Albany fans “are a bunch of douchebags,” 
Fawkes warned everyone. “But why worry about things 
you can’t control?”
“Can we swear at the fans?” a tall man asked.
“Read your fucking rulebook,” Fawkes said.
“You can swear,” another guy whispered to him. 
“Just not excessively.”
Welts and Malady walked back to the car, apologizing 
that I would have to sit next to them in their “stinky 
derby gear” on the way home. 
As we drove, Welts couldn’t stop talking derby. 
“Sometimes, you’re there, standing up straight. The 
next thing you know your feet are out from under you,
