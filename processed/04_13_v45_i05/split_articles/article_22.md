tight-fisted with its money to help the state’s nascent 
wind industry get off the ground. He sounded slightly 
peeved as he described how, as an early recipient of 
funds specifically for on-site generation, Phoenix Press 
hit it big, but several other more recent wind projects 
have been turned down. Though CEFIA still provides 
grants and rebates, which are largely paid for by a 
renewable energy fee on customers’ utility bills, it has 
aimed to reduce reliance on such direct funding. Instead, 
Ljungquist said, they want to serve as a “green bank” 
that attracts private capital to the energy efficiency 
market. For Ljungquist, this puts his organization at 
the forefront of renewable energy development. For 
Weston-Murphy, it is a problem: “They are more finance 
people now than they are technology people, so they’re 
just looking at hard numbers as opposed to what are we 
trying to do here,” he said. In any case, Connecticut’s 
state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards 
require that utilities get twenty percent of their energy 
from renewable energy sources by 2020, so development 
of renewable technology, wind or otherwise, has to 
continue. 

While Driscoll described his turbine as unobtrusive, 
lovely even—a moving piece of sculpture that was 
quieter than the motorcycles driving by outside, other 
residents do not seem to share his view on the energy 
machines. “People don’t want tall towers in their 
backyard, or their neighborhood, or even their town,” 
Ljungquist said. A wind testing machine at Yale’s West 
Campus was shut down three years after its construction 
due to complaints about its beeping noise. A wind farm 
proposal in Prospect, Connecticut was shut down due 
to locals’ bitter protests. The proposed Cape Wind 
development in Nantucket Sound, which is set to be 
the first offshore wind farm in the country, has won 
approval, but is still highly controversial. 

After emerging from rooms filled with hulking 
printing presses with ink-smeared rollers into the 
backyard of Phoenix Press, it was hard to not to look up 
at the turbine’s slender white stalk and find it beautiful. 
The motor whined faintly, and Driscoll and I listened 
to the whoosh of blades slicing through the air. As the 
wind bit into our cheeks, we shrank into our coats and 
stuffed our hands further into our pockets. The area was 
overgrown with weeds, and a pile of rubbish sat in front 
of a the remnants of a building next door, making the 
turbine seem all the more majestic as it spun above us. 

Weston-Murphy said that tens of thousands of 
people who commute across Q-Bridge each 
day see the turbine, and, despite its limitations, it is 
“a testament to the Yankee ingenuity spirit.” Though 
Driscoll sounded disappointed as he spoke of the 
lack of profit from the turbine, he has maintained 
some of that go-getter spirit, partly for himself and 
partly for people like me who come to learn about 
the future of renewable energy in Connecticut: “It’s 
so cool to look at it, to watch it spin, and to know 
that it’s helping run and keep the lights on for this 
whole big plant,” he said, brimming with pride.

As I bid Driscoll farewell at the door to the 
offices that have emptied out and gone dark for the 
day, I could not help but get caught up in his bright 
vision of the turbine. But as I headed back down 
Chapel with a broken bike light, oddly querulous 
winds pushing up against me at each turn, the turbine 
receded in the distance until it was just a pinwheel on 
the horizon.
