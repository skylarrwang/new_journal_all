ith its clock tower, stone columns, and vast 
front steps, the entrance of Fair Haven PreK-
8 School in the New Haven neighborhood 
of the same name looks classically neo-Gothic. But 
one glance inside the school, with its mural-lined walls 
adorned by writing and drawings of every language and 
culture, revealed that its student body hardly matches its 
19th-century façade. 


On a Wednesday afternoon, English-as-a-second-
language (ESL) teacher Michael Soares retrieved Yasser* 
from his sixth-grade reading class to help calm down 
his first-grade sister. The girl had been running around, 
hiding under tables and refusing to listen to instructions. 
From afar, the interaction looked like a typical exchange 
between a teacher and his students. In fact, it was a 
communication chain: Soares spoke English to another 
sixth-grader named Tahir*, who translated his words in 
Arabic for Yasser, who then conveyed the sentiments to 
his sister. 


“Can you tell Yasser to ask his sister why she is 
mad?”
“He says that she does this sometimes at home.”
“What does his mom do when she gets mad? Does 
she let her be mad?”
“He says it goes away.”


After a few more questions, Soares put one hand 
on Yasser’s shoulder and shook his hand. The boy, who 
spoke no English and looked at the ground as he talked, 
smiled a little. 


Yasser and his sister are Yemeni refugees. They had 
arrived at school the day before with little prior English 
language instruction and no exposure to American 
customs. Their situation is not unique. For over half of 
the 660 Fair Haven students, English is not their native 
language. One hundred of these students have been in 
the U.S. for less than a year, and thirty-eight are resettled 
refugees from Africa and the Middle East.


“Every day I’m amazed at how resilient the 
kids are,” Soares said. He has been teaching ESL to 
kindergarten, first-grade, and second-grade classes at 
Fair Haven for six years. The biggest challenges arise, 
he told me, when the students’ problems are beyond the 
school’s resources.


With its integrated Newcomer program, Fair Haven 
School is the default destination for children of refugee 
and other immigrant families in New Haven. The 
school has had a long relationship with the non-profit 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services (IRIS), 
Connecticut’s center for immigrant support. 


Many of the refugees, especially the younger 
ones, arrive at Fair Haven having undergone emotional 
trauma. Some suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, 
others from separation anxiety. Many of their parents 
also distrust the public school system. The Newcomer 
program works to ease the transition from the students’ 
home countries and remedy parents’ worries, goals

always easier said than done.


“You can only do so much over the course of a 
school day,” ESL teacher Kristin Mendoza said. But she 
added that the students at Fair Haven are able to make 
friendships across cultural lines, which she had not seen 
at the Brooklyn elementary school where she previously 
taught. Though it also had a diverse student body, 
ethnic divisions had been clear. There was a table in the 
cafeteria where all the Haitians sat, and tables where all 
the Caucasians sat. By contrast, Fair Haven students 
seem to be unaware of the ways in which their cultural 
differences could separate them. Instead, they relish the 
opportunities to share their perspectives.


New English learners and native speakers are 
not separated in classrooms at Fair Haven. Instead, 
all newcomers are enrolled in 
mainstream classes and assigned 
ESL teachers who provide on-the-
spot support. Walking down the 
hall, Soares picked students out 
of their classrooms to participate 
in the day’s speaking exercises. 
He asked a class of first-graders 
for volunteers to talk about their 
experiences adapting to American 
life, and half a dozen hands shot 
up. He chose Landry*, a boy 
from Burundi. Earlier, Soares had 
shown me Landry’s latest project: 
a print made with a collection of 
ink stamps depicting two human 
silhouettes surrounded by a cluster 
of trees, with a star floating above 
the scene. 


He had moved his hand across the picture. “Most 
kids at this age just put a combination of objects, and 
it doesn’t make a lot of sense. Landry was the only one 
who made a whole image.”


Landry was unhappy to be called out into the 
hallway, where the ESL students often did verbal 
exercises with Soares. He sulked, leaning against the wall 
while two children from China played tag around him. 
Soares asked Landry what was going on, but Landry just 
shrugged. 


“What color are you on?” Soares tapped Landry’s 
shoulder. 
Landry shrugged again. “Green.” 
“Ah, I thought you might be on red,” Soares said. “I 
thought that maybe you were mad because you were on 
red.” When asked to explain what the schoolwide color 
system meant, Sarah*, a Chinese girl, spoke up.


“Red is bad, yellow is a little good, green is good.”
“What do you have to do to be on green?” Soares 
asked.
“Be nice. Don’t fight. Try your best.”


The other boy was Ming*. Both Ming and Sarah had 
been in America for less than a year, and were amused to 
learn that I also spoke Chinese. Excited to converse with 
a stranger in their native tongue, they chattered excitedly 
about the strangeness of America—the big country, and 
its fast-talking people.


Soares pointed out that Sarah’s parents work at a 
Chinese restaurant, while Ming’s dad is a researcher at 
Yale. Landry’s parents had left him at a refugee camp. Yet 
watching the students interact, there was no indication 
of a difference in their socioeconomic backgrounds. 


During the school’s St. Patrick’s Day celebration, 
the students came to school 
decked out in green. Many come 
from families who are unfamiliar 
with the holiday. But Principal 
Margaret-Mary Gethings said 
that their time at Fair Haven has 
made them “background blind.” 


The school is no stranger to 
all-inclusive cultural festivities: 
it had an African Heritage 
Celebration in early March, and 
a Hispanic Heritage Celebration 
last October. Mendoza and 
her fellow ESL teachers are 
planning a cultural fair for this 
spring, when they hope to bring 
community cultural associations 
and arts organizations to the 
school in a showcase of New 
Haven’s immigrant population.


Mendoza asked a class of sixth graders what the 
hardest part of their immigrant experience has been. 
Many of them laughed, because the answer seemed 
obvious: learning English. A boy from Puerto Rico 
recalled, “Everyone walks around, talking and talking, 
and you get dizzy!” 


But Katie*, a rambunctious, bright-eyed girl from 
Burundi, gave a different response.
 “I’m scared ’cause sometimes people be dying in 
the streets.” She paused. “There’s shooting and bullying. 
People judging how you look.” She looked up at 
Mendoza. “I wish in America there can only be peace.”
* The names of  the students have been changed.
