family would eat preserved vegetables called tseukemono, 
which literally translates to “pickled things.” Originally, 
she says, she hated some of the pickled foods her family 
ate, but came to develop an enthusiasm for the craft.


More than the idea of returning to ancestral foods, 
I identified with Litwin’s comment that fermenting food 
is like having a pet. It not only adds a few billion new 
creatures to your living space, it also requires constant 
maintenance and commitment. After bestowing so much 
care upon my kimchi, I almost couldn’t bring myself to 
consume it. But I eventually gave in, closing my eyes 
as the sour yet spicy cabbage crunched in my mouth. 


A few weeks later I found myself walking to 
Edge of the Woods, a self-described “natural market” 
in New Haven, to pick up ingredients to make kefir, 
a type of fermented milk. The recipe I followed 
stressed that kefir was an acquired taste, but I felt 
confident enough in my newfound enthusiasm for 
fermentation to try it. Occasionally I felt embarrassed 
by my sudden interest in fermentation. Was I simply 
a bandwagon fan, latching onto the latest trend?
“I was that weird kid working at a pickle shop,” 
RocheAdachi laughs. “And then I came back and 
all of a sudden fermentation was the thing of 
2013.” She informs me that I’m “not the first” to 
have asked her about fermentation as a craze. “But 
I do fear that it will be too much of a food fad.”


One later afternoon after I strained my kefir, I 
practiced steeling my nostrils against its harsh, sour 
scent. My roommate once again looked skeptical when 
I brought the concoction back to our room. I haven’t 
yet brought myself to try the dish, as a troubling 
thought occurred to me upon first smelling it: I can’t 
tell the difference between kefir and rancid milk.

**Title: Not Rocket Scientology**
**Author: [Author not specified]**

The plain glass door sits between two storefronts 
on Whalley Avenue, and a sign directs visitors up the 
gray-carpeted staircase into an L-shaped corridor. 
Suddenly, his name is everywhere. It’s plastered across 
posters, running down the spines of books that fill 
the bookcases lining the walls, and printed beneath his 
picture, enshrined to the right of the entrance. As soon 
as you walk into the Church of Scientology of New 
Haven, you begin to breathe L. Ron Hubbard, founder 
of Dianetics and Scientology. 


Monica Koehler, an employee of the Church, tells 
me that Scientology means the study of knowledge. 
Hubbard published his first work in the 1950s and 
died in 1986, leaving behind a massive body of 
writings. There are no official leaders of the Church 
of Scientology—instead, all practices and beliefs are 
reinforced by Hubbard’s work. Kathryn Lofton, an 
associate professor of religious studies and professor 
of American studies at Yale, says there is no area of 
life that Hubbard did not touch on in his writings, 
and that practicing Scientology is “a surround-sound 
experience, where Hubbard is the surround.” 


Hubbard condensed his earliest research into 
the idea of Dianetics, which claims that the mind can 
be divided into the analytical mind, responsible for 
rational thought, and the reactive mind, the source of 
all man’s evil. In moments of pain, the analytical mind 
shuts down and the reactive mind takes over. Within 
the reactive mind are engrams, or hidden commands, 
which are formed during traumatic moments and 
lay dormant until triggered. Dianetics is the process 
through which a practitioner can clear the mind of 
these engrams and lead a pain-free existence. 


The church has stood at its Whalley location 
for the past thirty years, but it will soon be moving 
to a larger location nearby, to accommodate more 
worshippers. Koehler could not reveal any specifics 
as to when the move was occurring, though plans 
for the move have been in the works since 2005. 


Koehler said she couldn’t give me an exact number of 
practitioners in New Haven. It is difficult to quantify 
the exact number, she emphasized, because some 
worship at the center, while others practice at home. 
Worshipping at the center could include attending 
seminars, meeting with a representative from the 
center for a Dianetics session, or simply learning 
more about Scientology. This nebulous definition is 
consistent with Scientology’s religious structure as 
a movement; the organization is typically reluctant 
to publish figures. What is known is that, typically, 
Scientology has been most appealing to the aspiring 
middle class and is concentrated in urban areas, like 
New Haven, Lofton said.


But, according to Koehler, “the way to learn 
about Scientology is to find out what is true for you.” 
It does seem contradictory to try to tell the story of 
Scientology without experiencing it for myself. In 
an email, she offers me a free trial auditing session. 
Dianetics teaches that participating in such a session 
is the first step an individual can take to eliminate the 
reactive mind.
