Ten minutes after I was due at Phoenix Press, 
Inc., the spokes of my bike were still spinning. 
I searched out every corner’s street sign, hoping 
that the next would say James Street. Knowing that the 
friendly businessman I had spoken to was probably 
checking his watch, I had the sinking feeling that comes 
with being lost—until I saw the waving white arms of 
the wind turbine. They twirled gracefully in the breeze 
against the blue background of the sky. The turbine’s 
long, slender base reached far above the boats gliding 
under the bridge nearby and the children playing in the 
park below.


Connecticut’s only commercial-size wind turbine 
is perched at the meeting of the Quinnipiac and Mill 
Rivers in an industrial area of New Haven. It belongs 
to Phoenix Press, a family-run business that prints 
everything from instruction manuals to calendars, and 
which erected the 150-foot-tall machine in 2010 to help 
power its production center. Brian Driscoll, one of the 
owners of the press and the man behind the turbine idea, 
has a maverick streak; he has fought to make his printing 
business succeed in an industry where companies are 
rapidly closing doors, but has done so by jumping into 
another that is struggling to get off the ground. Though 
Driscoll’s project was mostly met with support, many 
other wind energy initiatives in Connecticut have failed. 
Several years after the inauguration of Phoenix Press’s 
turbine, questions remain about whether turning to 
wind was—and is—worth the cost, for both Driscoll 
and the rest of the state. 
Driscoll, a large, white-haired man with rimless 
glasses, met me in a waiting room featuring an antique 
printing press purchased at an auction. After ushering 
me into his office, he showed me a computer screen with 
an image of a turbine and three virtual dials tracking 
the turbine’s velocity (nearly one revolution per second, 
when I arrived), total energy production, and wind 
speed. The day was a windy one, and as I watched as the 
virtual needle indicating wind direction flick downwards, 
toward the south, I knew the real turbine was turning 
with it.


Since Driscoll and his two brothers, Tony and Kevin, 
founded their company in 1982, many relatives have 
found jobs there. Kevin is still a co-owner; their mother 
worked as a receptionist and their sister as a bookkeeper, 
Driscoll told me after we walked past his daughter at the 
front desk. Only seven of the thirty-two employees are 
related to him, but he extends the same familial good 
feeling to all his employees. 
The staff has shrunk over the years, and is far 
from the seventy-five people it used to be. When the 
economy started to tank in 2007, he looked for ways 
to cut back on purchases, labor costs—anything that 
would help Phoenix Press. Business looked bleak, and 
Driscoll was not alone in his concerns. According to the 
National Association for Printing Leadership (NAPL) 
and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over a quarter

of commercial printers have shut down since 2000. 
Industry employment has fallen by over forty percent 
because of newer, more efficient machines that require 
less manpower. Additionally, many clients have begun 
designing their own products rather than working with 
external pre-press departments, and have also turned to 
the Internet to distribute information that would have 
been printed.


This economic desperation 
sparked the idea for the wind 
turbine. Perhaps for my benefit, 
Driscoll told the moment of 
revelation with cinematic detail. 
It happened on a break 
one afternoon: “When I walked 
around 
the 
corner 
of 
building, the wind was blowing, 
and it started to blow my hair. 
My shirt was fluttering and my 
pants were fluttering,” Driscoll 
said. After a stroll later the same 
afternoon toward a nearby air 
quality monitoring station that 
also kept track of wind speed, 
he started to ask more questions 
about solar, wind, and tidal energy. In the following 
months, he petitioned for permission to build a turbine 
from the local planning and zoning commission, and 
secured a $200,000 grant from the Connecticut Clean 
Energy Fund, the quasi-state agency that has since 
become the Connecticut Clean Energy Finance and 
Investment Authority (CEFIA). Despite all the troubles 
technology had brought, it also had the potential to save 
Phoenix Press. 
Though the total cost of the turbine, $500,000, was 
high, they decided to install it largely for its financial 
benefit, as it would both cut electricity costs and make the 
press more attractive to customers 
invested in sustainability. 
“We were doing things in the 
right direction, but this was going 
to separate us a huge amount 
from our competition,” Driscoll 
said. Still, he maintained that 
the company’s green practices, 
which 
include 
recycling 
all 
paper, cardboard, wood skids, 
and aluminum plates; printing 
on paper certified by the Forest 
Stewardship Council; and using 
linseed- 
and 
soybean-based 
inks, are not solely financially 
motivated. 
Blaine 
Collison, 
Director of the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s Green Power 
Partnership, in which Phoenix Press participates, pointed 
out that the three hundred or so new partners each year 
come in with a desire to be green, but they would not—
or perhaps could not—join if they did not profit from 
investing in sustainability projects.


A small business like Phoenix 
Press hitting headlines with 
its biggest project in several 
decades was meant to be a 
game-changer. Poster-size 
prints of  construction day 
photos still lie in a stack in 
the office.

Though Driscoll was not one of the “rugged guys” that 
installed the turbine, as he calls them, he was involved 
in the construction process every step of the way. He 
showed me a photo of himself in a white hardhat, 
harness, and sunglasses, noting that a crane lifted him 
nearly above the turbine itself so that he could get a 
better look. “Can you imagine? That’s how high I was,” 
he said. “But at that point I would have jumped up there. 
I was so excited.”
Since then, dozens of articles have been written 
about the turbine, and over a thousand people have 
visited. Hundreds of schoolchildren entered into 
a contest to name the turbine, which was adorably 
christened Gus(t). But Driscoll’s enthusiasm is decidedly 
subdued now; the turbine has been less of a boon 
than he and his brother had 
hoped it would. Though all 
of the press’s clients can see 
the “Wind to Print” logo on 
their products, their biggest 
concern, ultimately, is printing 
costs: “Regardless of how 
good you are and how well 
equipped you are and how 
many turbines you have and 
how many green initiatives 
you have, you’ve got to have at 
least close to the lowest price,” 
Driscoll said. Andrew D. 
Paparozzi, NAPL’s chief economist, pointed out that this 
hypercompetitiveness makes other companies shy away 
from green initiatives; when asked about their capital 
investment priorities for the next three years, only eleven 
percent of commercial printers cited sustainability. Gary 
Jones, an assistant vice president at Printing Industries 
of America, noted that the vast majority of the industry 
is taking some environmentally-friendly measures: “The 
real question is what’s the level.” Recycled papers and 
vegetable-based inks are fairly common, he said, but 
many companies are hesitant to take steps as bold as 
Phoenix Press has. With space limitations on smaller 
companies and sky-high technology costs, generating 
their own energy is simply not feasible. Even if they 
were to go ahead with new eco-friendly projects, returns 
are never guaranteed. 
Driscoll’s turbine generates about a third of 
Phoenix Press’s electricity, and the company is credited 
by the local utility when it feeds unused energy to the 
neighborhood’s electricity grid. But as Driscoll hesitantly 
admits, the company’s profit margin has been less 
generous than expected because the turbine just isn’t 
spinning as quickly as expected. The press estimated 
energy production using standard maps that show 
wind speeds one hundred meters in the air, where wind 
speeds are much higher than at the turbine’s actual level. 
According to Dave Ljungquist, the Director of Energy 
Efficiency Deployment at CEFIA and a member of 
the committee that approved Phoenix Press’s grant, as 
a result, the company’s actual energy output is tens of 
thousands of kilowatt-hours below the estimates each 
year. Back in the Phoenix Press offices, Driscoll drew a 
sketch on a piece of paper to show me how Long Island 
blocks some of the wind coming into Long Island 
Sound, creating disruptive turbulence. Ljungquist thinks 
that the more likely cause of this turbulence is nearby 
structures, such as Q-Bridge and the smokestacks of 
United Illuminating’s English Station.


Though new technology has 
helped CEFIA more accurately 
track lower-level winds, the outlook 
is bleak. “Given the technology 
that we have in wind, a good wind 
turbine really doesn’t start to look 
economical unless you see an average 
wind speed of twelve miles per 
hour,” Ljungquist said. “There are 
very, very few places in Connecticut 
that have an average wind speed of 
twelve miles per hour.” However, 
he described all the other turbines 
you would find if you took a drive 
north on Route I-95, which made Massachusetts and 
Rhode Island look like they have slightly more optimistic 
prospects.  
Glenn Weston-Murphy, the founder of the 
Connecticut Wind Working Group, said that while 
Connecticut will never have wind farms on the scale of 
those in Texas and Oklahoma, smaller-scale development 
is likely. When I met him in one of the restricted-access 
rooms of Yale’s Mason Laboratory, Weston-Murphy, 
who works as an engineering design adviser there, said, 
“Phoenix Press is a nice example of where it can and 
does work reasonably.” His big complaint was that 
CEFIA and Connecticut’s legislators are not doing 
enough. With a touch of cynicism, he said that the 
fact that Phoenix Press’s small 100-kilowatt turbine is 
the only commercial-size turbine currently functioning 
in the state is “representative of the sort of lukewarm 
reception that Connecticut has for wind energy.” 
From Weston-Murphy’s perspective, CEFIA is too
