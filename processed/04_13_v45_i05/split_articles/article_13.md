A
s a spectator of the burgeoning activism scene on 
campus, I’ve been struggling to keep track of the 
major players. Groups and causes at Yale have high 
turnover rates, and I’ve learned the hard way that it’s best 
not to get too attached. After all, it’s tough to have one’s 
heart set on Occupying Morgan Stanley when everyone 
else has long since begun Pushing for Divestment. 

But this year, I forgot about my pledge of 
disengagement. I chose to champion the Yale Syndicate, 
an underdog group with what I hoped was just enough 
audacity to successfully patch the university’s various 
wounds. 

I cheered when its tiny rabblerousing army 
orchestrated a walkout of Rick Santorum’s debate with 
the Yale Political Union on “traditional marriage.” I felt 
I could trust my damaged heart with the artistes who had 
manufactured a zine the Yale Herald deemed “Best Rival 
Publication” earlier this winter.  They vowed to save me 
— and fellow campus sinners —from the temptations 
of “unjust power, despondent apathy and paralyzing 
complacency.”

But, as I learned in the last several weeks, the Y 
Syndicate is dead. Or at least in a deep coma, lacking nearly 
all vital signs of life. Don’t worry: the process was slow, but 
not painful. In fact, they barely realized it was happening. 
Or maybe the Syn hasn’t died so much as dissolved. The 
solvent was time, and maybe a dash of apathy—along with 
over-commitment.

Perhaps it’s best if, like most of the campus, you were 
only marginally aware of its presence. Fewer to mourn its 
inopportune passing.

In mid-March I spoke with the student collective’s 
leaders-by-default Carl Chen ’13 and Marc DeWitt ’15, 
along with a few others, in order to perform its last rites—a 
verbal autopsy of sorts.

We began with its birth. The group started in the 
spring of 2012 as a circle of four or five students frustrated 
by a perceived neoliberal status quo and seeking a space 
for radical leftist intellectual discussion. They individually 
“brewed on that for most of the summer” and returned in 
the fall ready to christen their shared anger, Chen told me.

The term “syndicate” comes out of the anarchist 
branch of anarcho-syndicalism, which rallies an underclass 
to band together to control its own fate. Y Syn wanted 
an organizational structure that was similarly “kind of 
collective, kind of union, but a little more autonomist and 
horizontal,” Chen said. 

Like their namesake tradition, they aimed to avoid 
power’s corruptive tendencies.
 “We didn’t want a place at the table,” DeWitt clarified. 
Unlike fellow activist group Students Unite Now (SUN), Y 
Syn wanted to deconstruct powerful institutions like Yale 
without forming new ones. It was the perfect set-up: a near-
impossible challenge, a greedy corporate archenemy, and a 
healthy rivalry.

In the beginning, things worked. They held assemblies 
that netted as many as fifty members in front of Beinecke 
Plaza’s war memorial. They invited professors to speak with 
them, including political scientist Jim Sleeper, known for his 
scathing criticisms of many Yale administrative decisions. 
They even kept up a website until late September. 
Nick Leingang ’13 was most involved with the process 
of creating the zine—a homemade, collage-style publication 
common in activist circles. He solicited submissions from 
friends with similar political leanings to “revitalize public 
discourse,” the Syn’s stated goal.

Distributed erratically across campus in hard copy and 
eventually posted online, the zine featured illustrations, 
lists, articles and manifestos. Leingang wrote a personal 
essay called “Straddlers” about the struggles of being a Yale 
student from a working class background. Kendra Dawsey 
’14 curated a “Basic Bitch List,” which includes Christopher 
Columbus, “legitimate rape” believer Todd Akin, and Yale’s 
slaveholding residential college namesake John C. Calhoun.

But their attempts to move from discourse to public 
action hit a roadblock: how could they turn their idealized 
alternatives into concrete solutions? 
“Can you live out…theory?” Chen asked. The simple 
answer is: probably not. Especially not while at Yale. But 
I can see the appeal of setting vague goals and taking a 
meandering path to meet them.

Thinking about that path, I get a flashback. A grassless 
lawn, a sea of tents, huddled bodies. Occupying. A 2011 
New York Times article described Occupy Wall Street 
as a protest movement with “faulty aim,” a “lack of 
cohesion,” and a “wish to pantomime progressivism rather 
than practice it knowledgably.” And that was a relatively 
tame critique, before the protesters slunk out of their 
encampments and out of the major press.

Both leaders were familiar with Occupy’s well-
documented pitfalls, but Chen says they wondered if they 
could be the ones to get a little closer to closing the gap 
between theory and reality, as students “in a safe space with 
a lot of time.”

And when President Richard Levin announced his 
departure, the presidential search proved to be good for 
a test drive.

Both Y Syn and its friendly competitior SUN 
petitioned for transparency in the process. While Y 
Syn tried to “create its ideal world,” SUN’s approach to 
activism was more “direct,” Alejandro Gutierrez ’13 
said. The group rallied students to speak with the search 
committee at an open forum.

But a forum was a little too formal for Y Syn’s style. 
No wheedling for change—they wanted action. And they 
wanted it to be “playful,” DeWitt said. SUN was angry 
with the university administrators for excluding student 
voices, but Y Syn never expected anything better from 
them in the first place.

In late September, SUN and Y Syn started a petition 
on change.org that received almost four hundred signatures 
from across the community—albeit out of a community 
that includes eleven thousand current students. At the 
open forum on September 28, students expressed their 
grievances to the search committee for over two hours. 
Earlier that day, Y Syn members chalked classrooms in 
Harkness Hall and Linsly-Chittenden Hall with “playful, 
but critical” slogans, to encourage 
the student body to attend the 
meeting, DeWitt said.

In early October, they placed 
empty wooden chairs on Cross 
Campus, Old Campus and Beinecke 
Plaza, with signs taped to them that read “The Empty 
Seat of Student Representation in the Presidential Search 
Committee.” A photo of one of the chairs made it into 
the Yale Daily News’ Cross Campus section. Presumably, 
students passed by the grouping on their way to section 
that Wednesday night. 

This initiative, like other Y Syn public actions, DeWitt 
clarified, was not “endorsed democratically by the Y 
Syndicate assembly.” The organization was founded not 
to strictly organize students in the traditional sense, but 
rather to encourage participation in proactive and reactive 
critiques of the university.

A month after the chairs were placed, the Yale 
Corporation chose Peter Salovey as Yale’s new president.

Famed Yale anarchist James Scott theorizes in his 
1985 work “Weapons of the Weak” that powerless people 
use small rebellious acts to protect their interests against 
institutions trying to extract their labor, goods, money, or 
interest. 

If we zoom in so uncomfortably close that Yale is 
the world and the Corporation is the state, maybe we 
can see Y Syn’s strategies as analogous to those Scott 
describes, which include “foot dragging, dissimulation, 
false compliance, pilfering [and] feigned ignorance.” In the 
right circumstances, resistance by marginalized peoples 
can drastically change the course of the state’s decisions 
and severely undermine oppressive projects.

Without student input, the Corporation may have 
forgone the safe option and “chosen someone more 
imperial,” DeWitt said.

Plus the Syndicate’s existence gave SUN a public 
relations boost, Chen said, preventing either from seeming 
like “some fringe, marginal sort of organization.” 

But Leingang thinks the group’s focus on the 
presidential search was misdirected, especially since many 
were seniors, unlikely to be affected by the university’s 
future president. “Yale faculty, Yale workers, New Haven 
people should be involved. Our opinions don’t really 
matter,” he said.

Ultimately, Y Syndicate may have been the wrong 
vehicle for grassroots activism altogether. 
“Hierarchical institutions are more efficient. We just 
weren’t about efficiency,” DeWitt said.

Realistically, perhaps Y-Syn is just a ragtag band 
of pranksters. I’m sure others could successfully argue 
they’re neither, both, or somewhere in between. Either 
way, they’ve done something, 
mainly whatever they felt like 
doing, whenever they felt like 
doing it. Numbers, structure, 
organizational longevity? Not 
that important.

Over this year, Chen and DeWitt said they’ve seen 
individual acts likely inspired by the Y Syndicate. For 
example, neither was sure exactly who sent out an e-mail 
from President-elect Peter Salovey’s e-mail referring to 
himself as the “President-select,” with the explanation, “It 
seems that my ‘s’ key was malfunctioning.”

And neither knew who had painted event fliers blue 
and pasted them on the bulletin boards on Cross Campus. 
DeWitt suspects it may have been a statement about Yale’s 
controversial plans for a liberal arts college in Singapore.

Gutierrez confirmed that SUN was not responsible 
for either action.

For those seeking to continue the trend of sporadic 
semi-subversive hijinks, Y Syn leaves behind a heaping 
dose of institutional skepticism, a devil-may-care attitude, 
and vague plans for more zines. No one I spoke to knows 
definitively when or whether the group will continue its 
coordinated efforts. Perhaps when the weather is nicer, 
they said.

Can you live out theory?
