interview.
Daniel Yergin founded the New Journal in 1967, the summer before his senior year at Yale. He then went on to 
study international relations at Cambridge as a Marshall scholar, start an energy consulting company called Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates, and win the Pulitzer Prize for his 1992 book, The Prize. Yergin is one of  the most 
quoted authors on energy issues. A revised paperback edition of  his sixth book, The Quest: Energy, Security, and 
the Remaking of the Modern World—which The Economist called a “masterly piece of  work”—is out now. This 
is a condensed version of  the conversation Yergin had with members of  the New Journal’s editorial board when he was 
back on campus last month.

not have an outlet, and just came in.
We drew people from the graduate school: one 
of the key writers was the wife of a guy who had been 
my TA; there was a wife of a law school student. A 
freshman showed up who wrote this great article about 
when the Doors came to New Haven. The magazine 
gathered momentum very quickly; the talent appeared. 
Fiction narrative applied to nonfiction was the heart of 
what we were trying to do. 
TNJ: Tell us about the founding of the New Journal.
DY: I’d run for chairman of the YDN and lost. 
Usually when you lose you became managing editor, but 
I had this mission, the New Journal, to find this voice 
for New Journalism. I was able to raise a few thousand 
dollars, because that’s all we needed then, and start the 
magazine. We were able to get an office in the basement 
of Silliman and it worked like a magnet. Once it was 
there, people found their way there, people who might

TNJ: How much did the idea of New Journalism 
inform and shape the magazine, and was that challenging? 
You had to have all these literary skills.
DY: There were really strong models. Gay Talese 
and David Halberstam were very prominent. There was 
Esquire, New York—the kind of places where that writing 
was taking place. It was very compelling. We didn’t have 
a lot of questions about launching the magazine. We just 
had entrepreneurial self-confidence. Yale had this very 
strong entrepreneurial tradition in journalism that went 
back to Henry Luce and the founding of Time. Looking 
back, it seems to me that the New Journal was a bolder, 
riskier thing to do than it seemed at the time. 
TNJ: What did you like reporting on when you were 
starting out?
DY: I was always drawn to narrative. I did my senior 
thesis on satire in the Victorian novel, and I was taking 
a writing course with Robert Penn Warren. So I had this 
deep belief in the importance of storytelling, which I 
think I still have: to find the stories that illuminate, and 
find the emblematic personalities who carry the story. 
I certainly carried over the kind of writing and editing 
skills I learned at the New Journal into my life and my 
work.
I went to England to take a Marshall Scholarship, 
but I continued to do magazine journalism and wrote 
for British press, New York, and the New York Times 
Magazine. During the mid-seventies, my journalistic and 
academic interests came together around the subject of 
energy, and I began writing about energy journalistically. 
At Cambridge you don’t take any courses for a Ph.D. 
They just say, “Go away, write a book and come back.” 
At least, that’s what they said to me. That was my first 
book, Shattered Peace. I think that the kind of writing I 
learned from doing New Journalism was extremely 
helpful because that was the way I’ve written ever since, 
to combine argument with narrative.
TNJ: What leads you from that kind of narrative 
journalism to book-length journalism?
DY: One of our colleagues, Susan Braudy, gave me 
a writing lesson: you don’t sit down and write a book or a 
chapter. You sit down and write a paragraph. Eventually 
you have a lot of paragraphs and it looks like a chapter or 
an article. I think that in the books I write, the chapters 
have a kind of article-like arc to them. It is different, I 
think, to undertake a book. Both The Quest and The Prize 
took me a while to get going. It is a little overwhelming. 
When you are looking at scaling the heights of a book, 
it is a more complicated process to get yourself going. 
An article is very finite. You know it’s going to be three 
thousand, four thousand words, and you know how to 
shape it.
TNJ: Which newspapers do you read?
DY: We get five newspapers at home and lots of 
magazines. We must be one of the last households to do 
that. You have to decide what it is you want. Whether 
it’s the Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic or the 
Economist—you’re making an investment in the editors, 
the people who will be the gatekeepers for you, making 
the judgments, because otherwise you’ll just be bobbing 
in a constant sea of undifferentiated information.
