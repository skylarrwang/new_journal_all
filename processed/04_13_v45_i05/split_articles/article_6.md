our generation of the importance of DIY. It also has a 
lot to do with empowering yourself, bringing back the 
culture, really taking your health into your own hands.” 
My classmates and I painstakingly shredded 
cabbage, carrots, onions, peppers, and radishes into 
careful slices: too thin and the vegetables lose their 
crunch, too thick and they don’t absorb enough water 
in the fermentation process. After chopping everything, 
we tossed the mixture with salt and divided up the 
contents into four jars, one for each of us to take home. 
After two weeks, the vegetables would have soaked 
in their own juices long enough to turn into kimchi.


When I first read about fermentation, it seemed 
simple: chop up some produce, stick it in a jar with 
salt, and wait for the bacteria to do their thing. I quickly 
discovered that the process was not so dispassionate. 
I returned home from the class with my jar and strict 
instructions from Litwin to cover it with a plastic 
bag, compressing the vegetables throughout the day 
to ensure they remained submerged in their juices. I 
worried constantly about the health of my kimchi. 
I considered asking my roommate to check in on my 
kimchi while I was in class, but restrained myself. I 
began to view fermentation as not just an activity, 
but a lifestyle. Perhaps I would branch out into more 
complicated food and drink, incorporating some 
sort of fermented concoction in all of my meals.


Because of its ancient origins and resurgence 
in popularity, fermentation awkwardly straddles the 
realm between tradition and the New Age DIY culture 
currently embracing it. While it was first used by farmers 
and those in harsh climates to preserve extra food, it 
now represents a creative way to create healthy dishes. 
Litwin stresses fermentation as a way to eliminate food 
waste and increase farm productivity by preserving any 
surplus produce that would ordinarily be thrown away 
– a difficulty that I, having all of my meals provided 
to me in a dining hall, do not confront directly. 
Shizue RocheAdachi, a Yale sophomore who interned 
at a pickling store in Berkeley, California last summer, 
notes the contrast between fermentation’s various uses. 
“It’s definitely part of this whole artisanal 
food movement,” she says. “From the other 
side, it’s about a lot of people who are into 
the 
deprivation, 
hipster, 
being 
thrifty 
model.”


When I met RocheAdachi in a coffee shop, she 
ordered nothing; instead, she drank water from a Mason 
jar. A volunteer at the Yale Farm, her passion for self-
sufficiency and sustainability had sparked her interest in 
preservation technique. Her Japanese heritage exposed 
her to fermentation from a young age. As a child, her 
points of departure.


My Chemical Romance
My kimchi fermented in a jar by my pillow, smelling 
sour. I imagined the vegetable shreds bubbling in salt 
and their own juices, as the millions of bacteria in the 
container facilitated the vegetables’ chemical breakdown 
into the Korean staple. Nestling it further into an 
old sweatshirt, I made sure the concoction would be 
warm enough through the night – if it reached below 
room temperature, the bacteria would die and the 
fermentation would stop. My roommate watched my 
new, slightly bizarre nighttime ritual with skepticism.


My obsessive care for these pungent vegetables had 
only begun in March, after I attended a workshop titled 
“Break it Down: The Art and Wonder of Fermentation” 
at the New Haven Free Skool. Started by a group of 
artists and activists in New Haven, the Free Skool 
hosts volunteer-run classes on everything from herbal 
medicine to chicken raising. When I arrived at the 
first night of fermentation class, the long room was 
full. Fermentation – which keeps food edible through 
chemical breakdown by bacteria and yeasts – has grown 
in popularity over the past few months, both in New 
Haven and across the country. Both foodies and laypeople 
have joined in the trend, fermenting various foods and 
drinks in their own homes with Mason jars, salt, and 
bacteria cultures. The Free Skool originally intended to 
have around ten people in its fermentation class, but so 
many people signed up that the teacher sent around an 
email before the first class begging those who already 
knew how to make kimchi and sauerkraut to stay home.


“I’ve taught a lot of fermentation classes, and 
interest just increases every single year,” the teacher 
Diane Litwin told me. She speaks of fermentation with 
an almost spiritual devotion, likening the process in 
class to a magical experience. “I think it’s a big shift in
