EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At the center, Koehler takes me to an isolated room 
relatively free of posters and books. She sits across 
from me at a plain white desk. Her soft brown eyes and 
calming voice add warmth to the oddly unadorned room. 
She begins by asking me a few questions about my life, 
and what in particular I want to fix. For Scientology to 
have an impact on an individual, she says, that individual 
must be able to recognize an aspect of her life that could 
improve: “It can’t just work on its own. You have to be 
the one that wants to change something.” Across the top 
of a pile of printer paper, Koehler writes my name in 
large, loopy cursive, and directly under it she writes her 
own. This begins our auditing session. She tells me to 
close my eyes, explaining that I am allowed to stop the 
session at any time. 


Auditing sessions are based on the mind’s ability 
to transport itself back to a particular moment in time. 
Koehler asks me about my breakfast. Separate from 
the act of simply remembering, the exercise requires 
you to relive the experience: to smell the scents, see 
the surroundings, and hear the noises. The goal of an 
auditing session, Koehler says, is to isolate engrams in 
order to reclassify them as memories in the analytical 
mind.


The idea seems ludicrous to me. I smile as I begin 
recounting my breakfast experience at Blue State on 
Wall Street that morning. There was no painful emotion 
associated with that morning’s breakfast, but Koehler 
wants to make sure I was comfortable with the techniques 
of Dianetics before processing a more painful incident. 
After I relive breakfast two or three times, Koehler asks 
me if I am ready to move on.


I think back to a time earlier this semester when I 
felt like my world seemed to be coming down around 
me. I felt like I was friendless, I hated my classes, and had 
gotten involved in all the wrong extracurriculars. I felt 
that no one I had met at Yale had any idea who I really 
was. She guides me as I relive this sort-of breakdown. 
She prompts me with questions about how I am feeling, 
what I am seeing, hearing, and smelling. I recount the 
memory twice all the way through. It started in Blue 
State on Wall Street and ended in my common room. 
An hour passes. I begin my third recounting. Getting 
tired and frustrated, I dig the heels of my hands into my 
eyes and suddenly all I can see is blue. It is a bright royal 
blue, suddenly extinguishing the blackness that had filled 
my mind for the last hour. Koehler asks me to describe 
it, and I tell her was familiar but that I can’t place it. Then 
I realize it is the blue of the Blue State logo. Shocked, I 
take my hands away from my eyes, and immediately all I 
can see is the red of the logo’s text. 


When I leave the church, I don’t feel that I have 
learned anything new about myself. The experience was 
not quite delving, but I imagine what else I could have 
felt. The experience was not quite probing. What I left 
with was a mind full of color—visions of bright, bright 
blue.

**Title: Silent as the Dead**
**Author:  (Author not specified)**

I knocked on the door of the caretaker’s office, 
but no one answered. I could hear a dog barking and 
someone shuffling around inside, but no one came to 
the door. I pushed it open myself and walked into a 
cluttered, smoky room. “Who are you?” the gray-haired 
caretaker asked. After I introduced myself and asked to 
talk to him briefly about the cemetery, he called out, “I’m 
busy. Have a pamphlet,” shoving one in my hand and 
pushing me out the door. Being so abruptly dismissed 
shocked me, but the Grove Street Cemetery is, in both its 
history and its architecture, concerned with boundaries. 
The cemetery is twice removed from the world of 
the living—once through the existing barrier between 
life and death, and once through the tall surrounding 
wall, which now dampens the sound of passing cars and 
trucks. It participates in a tradition of the dislocation of 
death which began with the ekphora, or the secondary 
stage of ancient Greek funeral rites. The Greek 
metropolitans carried their dead outside the city to be 
buried, delineating the city by creating an inverse city 
of the dead on its outskirts. Similar motivations were 
behind the creation of the Grove Street Cemetery. The 
first town cemetery, centrally located on the New Haven 
Green, was sprawling, haphazardly organized, and 
pushed beyond its capacity by yellow fever epidemics 
in 1794 and 1795. In 1797, led by Senator James 
Hillhouse, a group of citizens successfully petitioned 
to move the cemetery to a new location on the edge 
of town, where the dead could be better separated 
and contained. The carefully-planned structures 
included wide grassy paths and square family plots.


As a result of this remove, walking in the Grove 
Street Cemetery can be disorienting. When I first saw 
the street signs that mark each path, I wondered why
