less, I would scream at them to stop. I 
awakened before I could imagine the 
violence. 

As the immediacy of the coup dissipated, the turmoil encouraged 
strange new anxieties to gnaw at me. 
The fact that I could not have full control over my life had made itself abundantly clear to me for the first time. 
Events far beyond my reach could 
drastically change the course of my

stable existence or, for that matter, 
could end it. An obvious truth, though 
I had previously given it little thought. 
Questions more typical of mid-life 
crises now occupied me. Did my role 
as an observer satisfy me? Did my 
career reflect my values? If I were to 
die tomorrow would I feel that I had 
pursued my true interests? Would I 
have made positive contributions to 
society, or neutral ones? This small 
dose of the world's chaos convinced 
me of the importance of making my 
ephemeral life meaningful and purposeful; it inspired me to try even 
harder to shape it. 

Half-heartedly reporting, I 
explored Manila with new 
eyes. Several million too 
many people inhabit the huge 
metropolis; they jam its streets 24 
hours a day with buses, cars, bicycles, 
jeeps, motorcycles, horses and buggies, 
and rickshaw-like carriages pulled 
along by boys and men riding bicycles. 
As I walked, all manner of vehicles 
clotted the humid air with grayish-
green soot. Hundreds of thousands of 
flimsy homes made from corrugated 
tin, cardboard, used tires, and discarded 
plywood lined all the major thoroughfares. Behind them, often, lay 
fetid open sewers that overflowed during 
the rainy months. 

Whole communities shared single 
running faucets; water splashed me as 
I passed bathers sponging themselves 
off only a few steps away. There were 
other sidewalk perils. Deep, stinking 
holes were left in the pavement by 
missing manhole covers, stolen and 
sold to be melted down. Half-naked 
toddlers crouched on the street curb to 
relieve themselves in the gutter. Filthy 
and malnourished children banged on 
car windows at stoplights to ask air-
conditioned passengers for money. I 
could not ignore these sights. 

I had seen such extreme poverty 
before, but I never had considered it, 
beyond a vague intellectual sense, as 
part of my world. This time I let it 
affect me. Walking through the streets 
in Manila, I found it relatively easy to 
regain a perspective on my life--easier, 
anyway, than I think it would have 
been had I continued to work 12 
hours a day behind a desk with a computer. Against this backdrop I decided 
to leave journalism and enter 
medicine. 

Lacking a compelling reason to go 
to medical school after my senior year 
in college, I had put aside my childhood 
plans to become a doctor. But 
those expeditions through Manila 
rekindled my interest. They served as a 
dramatic reminder of the great needs 
that exist in worlds outside my own 
sheltered one, and of the importance 
of trying to respond to them. 

Now, 18 months after returning 
to the States, I still feel inspired to 
embark on a new career that I believe 
will be of greater help to those who are 
in need. I will consider myself fortunate 
indeed if my life continues to 
reflect my dreams of Manila.
