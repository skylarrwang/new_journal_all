Behind the locked doors of Wolf's Head, Yale's last all-male secret society, members have waged a civilized debate over coeducation for the last 22 years. While Skull and Bones broke ranks with its governing board last spring and forced coeducation upon its unwilling alumni, Wolf's Head prefers to act by consensus. This October, the society will vote again on coeducation, perhaps for the last time. 


To address the issue of admitting women to Wolf's Head, the Board of Governors established an internal committee on coeducation in the mid-1980s, which polls the membership at large with annual questionnaires. Though the committee periodically changes members, the current board is weighted in favor of men who graduated before Yale went coed. This year the six-man committee includes members from the classes of '45, '53, '54, '59, '75, and '90. 


As one of Yale's ten elite senior clubs, Wolf's Head initiates 15 men from each junior class on the last Thursday in April. Rumors abound about Wolf's Head tap rituals-on initiation weekend, the old members induct the taps in their Egyptian artifact-laden "Hall" and give each new member a name that traces back to the original group. Tradition dictates that the delegation meet every Thursday and Sunday in the windowless building on York Street, as it has since 1883. Like Yale itself, Wolf's Head thrived for over a hundred years on the money of its usually white alumni. However, much has changed at the Hall since then. Today the society, like the university, seeks diversity. Blacks, Jews, and gays have joined the ranks of the institution-Wolf's Head even installed ramps in the early 80s ro make the Hall wheelchair accessible. Despite these strides, at a coed Yale, diversity without women is a contradiction. 


Alumni worry that admitting women would ruin the unique Wolf's Head experience. The crux of the debate focuses on personal histories, during which each member shares his most intimate thoughts in an environment of privacy and confidentiality. A growing number of members feel that women are necessary to make the experience more than just male bonding. But for many alumni educated in single-sex schools, personal revelation can only occur in the all-male setting. "The experience as I recall it of bonding and sharing your innermost thoughts-I don't see that happening in a coed environment," said Thomas Sargent (BK '58), who attended Yale in the days before coeducation and spent his preparatory years at an all-male school. "There would be embarrassment and holding back." 


Appropriately, one of the earliest advocates of coeducation at Wolf's Head was the man who helped bring women to Yale. In 1968, Sam Chauncey (DC '57) rook a two-year leave of absence from his position as the secretary of Yale College to hammer out the details of admitting women. As a champion of Yale's coeducation, Chauncey thought he could usher Wolf's Head into the new age. Chauncey raised the issue every year when the delegations invited him to the Hall to speak at alumni dinners. He brought the debate before the Board of Governors at their quarterly meetings and needled alums on the faculty. His work resulted in two votes on coeducation-one in the mid-70s and one ten years later-but both failed to muster the necessary two-thirds majority to pass. "It's hard to ask people who aren't used to being radical to go out and risk their necks," Chauncey said. "I worked at it for ten years and failed miserably." 


For most alums, coeducation just is not a burning issue. Despite lobbying efforts from both sides, a majority remains indifferent. "Coeducation is probably a huge issue to the the 30 percent or so who are in favor of it and the 10 percent who are vehemently against it," said Christopher Forster (TC '54), the president of the Phelps Trust Association, Wolf's Head's corporate name. "That leaves 60 percent of the membership who don't feel as strongly." 


For those who want coeducation, the society's failure to admit women is an embarrassment. Yale's President Benno Schmidt, a Wolf's Head alum, refuses to enter the Hall or attend any of the society's functions because of the all-male policy. "Wolf's Head sets a stinking example for the rest of the undergraduates at Yale, which prides itself on liberal values of inclusion," Chauncey said. "I don't like the idea that we have a discriminatory institution in our midst." 


Sam Chauncey resigned from Wolf's Head after the society refused to go coed. 
Chauncey's argument hits home with the younger members of Wolf's Head. Many believe that if the society wants to attract its first-choice taps, it cannot continue to exclude women from its ranks. Paul Saint-Amour (PC '91) turned down the tap because Wolfs Head would not admit women. "I can't imagine why you would be less inclined to tell the story of your life in front of women," he said. "What better way to work out the complexities between the sexes than in a coeducated environment?" 


However, a small alumni faction still holds fast to the traditional line. They maintain a legalistic defense reminiscent of other all-male organizations-they claim a private club reserves the right to determine the makeup of its membership. So far their point of view has prevailed because single-sex proponents held most of the leadership positions in the organization in the past. 


Opposition at the top and indifference among the membership have kept Wolf's Head from admitting women. "I'm sure that the majority of the members believe it should be coed. But they aren't willing to take the time to fight the leadership." said Chauncey, who quit Wolf's Head in disgust after the failure of the 1984 vote. Even the President of Phelps Trust has opposed coeducation.
