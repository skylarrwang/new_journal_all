**Title: Rosa DeLaura: Scaling Capitol Hill**
**Author: Jennifer Pitts**
**Page number(s): 12**

nly eight months into her first term as New 
Haven's congressional representative, Rosa 
DeLauro has made a reputation for herself as a pro-
fessional, not a newcomer to be coddled. "Rosa is clearly the 
best prepared person to represent her district of anybody 
I've seen in the dozen years I've been here," says 
Representative Sam Gejdenson (D-Connecticut), one of 
DeLauro's most ardent supporters. 

DeLauro spent 11 years in Washington, first as an aide 
to Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut) and then as 
director of several political organizations. Her time away 
from the district may have hurt her in the eyes of some con-
stituents-during last year's campaign, her opponent 
labeled her a "radical out-of-town feminist." But the politi-
cal experience she gained has served her well on the Hill. 

Colleagues note her eloquence on the floor as well as 
her involvement in a number of congressional groups. In 
addition to the requisite two committees, DeLauro belongs 
to several ad hoc groups, including the women's caucus, the 
urban caucus, and the Fair Trade task force. And she won a 
plum assignment when House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt (D-Missouri) appointed DeLauro to his "message 
group." The 15-member group formulates the Democratic 
position on key issues. 

At the start of the 1 02nd Congress, DeLauro's confi-
dent opinions and her obvious ease on Capitol Hill set her 
apart from the crowd. New members normally use their 
first few weeks to learn the maze of hallways that snake 
under Hill buildings and to establish contact with senior 
members of the House and Senate. Most of the other 44 
"freshmen" struggled to find their sea legs as they debated 
the ethics of war. "We were sworn in on January third, our 
offices opened on the seventh, and we immediately began a 
discussion of whether or not we were going to war,"

DeLauro recalls. "The war set the tone for the entire term." 

DeLauro wasted no time on office administration. She 
leapt into action with a nationally broadcast speech against 
the use of force in the Persian Gul£ Despite the divisiveness 
of the issue, DeLauro feels the war united Congress as few 
issues can. "It was an extraordinary discussion," she says. 
"The vote on whether to use force caused the same kind of 
anguish for people who had been there a matter of days and 
for people who had been there 40 years." 

While she admits that no subsequent debate has carried 
the weight of the war vote, DeLauro welcomed the return 
to domestic issues. "This year we've debated issues of partic-
ular interest to me, like health insurance and reform of the 
health care system," DeLauro says. "It's a new debate, but 
'1t serves women across the country 
well that someone as highly respected 
and as able as Rosa is also a woman. " 
there are bills on the table, and Congress is going to move 
on this in the next couple of years." 

DeLauro aims to represent the middle class and the 
working poor. She wants more progressive taxes and health 
care, and she supports her words with action. Her first 
major piece of legislation, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, 
champions those she refers to as "ordinary men and 
women." The bill provides tax breaks for all taxpayers in the 
15 and 28 percent brackets-under her bill a family of four 
earning $30,000 would save a third of their taxes. DeLauro 
plans to make up for the lost revenue by taking on the 
upper class. The bill includes a tax hike for top corporations
