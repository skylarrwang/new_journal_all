conviction and that Konesky's role in 
his arrest wouldn't have led Murray to 
kill her. He also told the court that 
after closing Don Phillip's on the night 
of the murd~r, he and Murray had 
driven together to the house of 
Murray's ex-girlfriend. Neither father 
nor son mentioned the story to police 
before the first tria!: Phil's testimony 
stretched the limits of believability. "I 
don't trust almost anything Phillip 
Colton said in the trial after he said his 
name, " said prosecutor Clark. "If 
you're estranged from your father you 
don't get into a car with him in the 
middle of the night to see if your ex-
girlfriend may be home." 

Phil Colton's credibility crumbled 
altogether after Jackie Boyles, the key 
defense witness, revealed that he had 
offered her money for helping his son. 
She told the court that she feared 
Colton-he cruised by her house sev-
eral times daily and propositioned her 
on the street while she hustled. Few 
believed Phil when he denied ever 
meeting Boyles. "The problem in our 
case is that the jury didn't like Phil 
Colton. They thought he was lying," 
said defense attorney Rosenthal. Still, 
the defense expected at least one juror 
would prevent Murray's conviction. To 
everyone's surprise, the jury arrived at 
a unanimous guilry verdict after only 
three hours. 

D
efense attorney Rosenthal 
casts Murray Colton's convic-
tion as the culmination of a 
witch-hunt by the New Haven Police, 
desperate to find someone to blame 
for the murder. "I think in cases of 
murder there's a tendency to believe 
that the system is doing the right thing 
-that someone has been apprehend-
ed," said Rosenthal. As Colton's 
lawyers prepare his appeal, Murray sits 
in the state penitentiary at Somers 
waiting for a hearing that isn't likely 
before next spring. 

After 
Murray's 
sentencing, 
Michael Konesky ventured back to 
Pepe's Market in Kimberly Square, 
Phil Colton's favorite afternoon haunt. 
SEPTEMBER 6, 1991 
"I just thought it was the last thing I 
had to do-to confront my mother's 
enemy," Michael said. He told Phil 
that his son had received 50 years-a 
' life sentence. M ichael turned and 
walked away as Phil yelled, "Are you 
happy now?" The question reverberat-
"How informants use 
their reward money is 
none of our business. J:l 
ed for Michael. During the three trials, 
he busied himself with aiding the pros-
ecution, but with Murray Colton in 
jail there is nothing more he can do for 
his mother. "I don't think you can ever 
get over a murder in your family. 
There's always a hole that will never be 
filled," Michael said. 

In 
May, 
a 
judge awarded 
Tourangeau $16,000 for her role in 
Murray 
Colton's 
conviction. 
Prosecutor Clark believes that she 
deserves the reward for risking her life. 
"Janice Tourangeau is the good citizen 
here. We always say, 'I wish someone 
would get involved. Why don't they?' 
It's because they're scared to death," 
Clark said. Tourangeau told the court 
that she hoped to escape the drug 
world that killed her friend Patry-she 
wanted to start a new life. 

But 
by 
July, 
police 
saw 
Tourangeau hustling, back on the 
streets of Kimberly Square. Friends 
report that Tourangeau spent most of 
the $16,000 on heroin, as Patry once 
had used her police rewards. While 
informants like Patty Konesky and 
Janice Tourangeau help the state con-
vict criminals, the New Haven Police 
continue to dose their eyes to the dev-
astation their money wreaks.
