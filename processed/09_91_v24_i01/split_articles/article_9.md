and a "millionaire's surtax" levied against people making 
more than $290,000. 

Democrats have noticed DeLaura's novel ideas. "When 
Rosa presented her bill she had the rapt attention of the 
Democratic caucus," says Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-California). 
Senator Dodd already has included parts of DeLaura's bill 
in his own Senate legislation. Though her bill won't pass on 
its own, it may well factor into a Democratic proposal. 
Anxious to make their mark, many new representatives 
try to pass a bill to prove their effectiveness in Congress. 
Few bills pack the punch of DeLaura's, however. At one 
conference, while DeLaura discussed her proposed tax cuts, 
Larry LaRocco (D-Idaho) wanted to authorize silver medals 
for the soldiers of the gulf war. De~uro leaves such bills to 
other freshmen. 


DeLaura also wields clout as a defender of abortion 
rights. Her pro-choice credentials ~e in handy when Rep. 
David Bonior (D-Michigan), who opposes abortion, need-
ed a powerful voice to second his nomination for Majority 
Whip. DeLaura's seal of approval reassured reluctant pro-
choice colleagues and helped swing the election. 
"It serves women across the country well that someone as 
highly respected and as able as Rosa is also a woman," says Rep. 
Pdosi. "Rosa is one of the reasons we will increase the number 
of women in Congress." While politics remains a man's game, 
DeLaura has worked hard to earn women a place in govern-
ment. In 1989 she directed an organization called EMILY's List, 
which promotes Democratic, pro-choice women running for 
congressional office. EMILY's List, short for "Early Money Is 
Like Yeast-it makes the dough rise," identifies viable candi-
dates, provides funds, and teaches them how to run their cam-
paigns. "There are only 29 women out of 435 representatives, 
and only two women in the Senate," DeLauro says. "At this rate 
we'll see parity in maybe the next 400 years." 
SEPTEMBER 6, 1991 
"Other politicians parukr to the whims of the day. Rosa sets her 
course with her heart," says Senator Chris Dodd of DeLauro. 
hough women are still underrepresented in poli-
cs, DeLaura never lacked. a female role model. Her 
other Luisa, whom DeLaura calls her main inspi-
racion, has served New Haven as an alderwoman for 25 
years. In the predominantly Italian neighborhood where 
DeLaura grew up, her kitchen table served as a center for 
political debates and constituent concerns. Before the death 
of her father, Ted, in 1971, the community dubbed him 
"Mayor of Wooster Square" for his longtime position as 
alderman of the ward. 

In the mid-60s, several years out of Marymount 
College, DeLaura returned to New Haven to work with a 
grassroots group called the Community Action Institute in 
the Hill district. There she met her mentor, New Haven 


activist Frank Logue. DeLauro spent 
the next ten years working for Logue, 
who became New Haven's mayor in 
1976. 

As the mayor's executive aide, 
DeLauro achieved a high administra-
tive rank at a time when women were 
virtually absent from appointed office. 
The position provided essential experi-
ence for her work .in Washington. 
"You have to get an understanding of 
what local government is all about," 
she says. "That's where the rubber 
meets the road." 
DeLauro claims to 
represent the middle 
class and the working 
poor. 

DeLauro earned a reputation in 
Washington for brains and political 
savvy when she served as chief of staff 
and campaign manager for Senator 
Dodd from 1980 to 1987. After leav-
ing Dodd's office, DeLauro stayed in 
Washington to work for several advo-
cacy organizations. Connections she 
formed on the Hjll proved one of her 
most valuable assets. "In a legislative 
body, a lot of how you get things done 
has to do with interpersonal relation-
ships," she says. "If people know you 
and trust you, there's less to learn 
when you get to Congress-you can 
move that much more quickly." 

With support from Washington 
politicos, DeLauro entered the race for 
New Haven's congressional representa-
tive in November 1989. Called the 
"consummate political organizer," she 
quickly eliminated her Democratic 
opposition with an unmatched talent 
for fundraising and a surname that 
spelled ability to many New Haven 
voters. "She's a very talented politician 
from a formidable political family," 
says David Mayhew, Yale professor of 
political science. 

Her Republican opponent Tom 
Scott, a young state senator from


Milford, had ten years in elective office 
and a relish for heated confrontations. 
A better speaker than DeLauro, Scott 
repeatedly proposed debates that she 
declined. One of the few radio debates 
DeLauro granted disintegrated into 
chaos. As Scott shouted "You're an 
extremist and a radical, Rosa," 
DeLauro shrilled back, "Just relax, 
Tom, just relax!" In an attempt to stem 
the fury, the mediator, WELl's Steve 
Kalb, turned off the candidates' micro-
phones. 

Their increasingly antagonistic 
speeches reduced the candidates to 
conventional black-and-white posi-
tions on conventional campaign issues. 
Scott opposed gun control and abor-
tion; DeLauro favored defense spend-
ing cuts and universal health insur-
ance. As the New Haven Register wrote 
during the onslaught, "Ask Rosa 
DeLauro and Tom Scott the time of 
day and you'll probably get two differ-
ent answers." 

Despite a considerable campaign 
treasury 
and 
support 
from 
Washington bigwigs like former 
House speaker Tip O 'Neill, DeLauro 
edged out Scott by only 7000 votes 
and four percentage points-the 
smallest margin in the state. While 
many say the Democratic machine 
that has run New Haven for years is 
rusting, DeLauro captured more than 
three times as many New Haven votes 
as Scott. The city's support sent her to 
Washington. But the majority of the 
district's voters live in the suburbs, 
where Democratic candidates must 
struggle for enough votes to win. 
DeLauro sqeaked by last November, 
and her challenge next year will be to 
convince suburban voters that she 
speaks their mind. 

T
o prove her efficacy to her con-
stituents, DeLauro lobbied 
hard to land committee assign-
ments that would benefit her jurisdic-
tion. She won her two first choices: 
Government Operations and Public 
Works and Transportation. "You could 
just see that compared to other fresh-
men, Rosa stood out," says Gejdenson, 
who belongs to the group that awards 
committee assignments to freshmen. 
"In almost every instance, she was 
among the top vote-getters." 

DeLauro made a judicious step 
when 
she 
chose 
Government 
Operations, a watchdog over federal 
waste and abuse. The spot may pave 
her way to more important financial 
committees such as Appropriations 
and Ways and Means. "Government 
Operations has access to a great deal of 
information," says Rep. Pelosi, who 
served on the committee before mov-
ing onto Appropriations. "Like 
Appropriations it covers a very wide 
jurisdiction." 

''You could_just see that 
compared to other 
freshmen, Rosa stood 
out. , 

Gejdenson sees DeLauro as the 
promise of the Connecticut delega-
tion. "One of the disadvantages of a 
small state, especially one with the 
high turnover we've had, is that it's 
very hard to build up a powerful oper-
ation," he says. But Gejdenson 
believes that soon, perhaps next year, 
DeLauro will win a spot on the influ-
ential Appropriations Committee; she 
would be the first Connecticut 
Democrat to do so in many years. "I 
tried twice myself, and lost to people 
from more powerful states," he said. 
"But having somebody of Rosa's ability 
makes up for our lack of seniority. My 
only hope is that she stays here for a 
long time."
