Patty was a regular at Don Phillip's [nternational Cafe. The owners son stands convicted of her murder. 
take them somewhere.' She went away 
for ten minutes, came back, and kept 
gabbing as if nothing unusual had 
happened." 

Street-wise and quick-witted, 
Patty learned to survive in the violent 
Kimberly Square area. When she 
moved there in 1986, many knew her 
as the only woman living alone in the 
neighborhood. She boasted of the 
time she broke a beer bottle over the 
head of a man who tried to pick a 
fight with her. Patty thought she could 
take care of herself. 

No stranger to hard times, Patry 
became pregnant with her only child 
at 15. She left her son Michael with 
her mother, ~ho ·raised him in 
Branford. Eventually Michael decided 
that he needed to meet Patty. "When I 
turned 16, I just wanted to find out 
who my mother was and why she 
didn't take care of me." He tracked 
down her address. When he went to 
Patty's house, a plain woman with 
straggly brown hair answered the door. 
"I asked her, 'Is Patty Konesky home?' 
She said 'No.' I told her to tell Patty 
that her son was here. She started cry-
ing.'' 

Michael moved in with his moth-
er for a month but rarely saw her. He 
would come home from work to a 
vacant apartment, Patry already off to 
the bars for the night. "One day I 
came home and she wasn't there. The 
locks were changed on the door," he 
said. Michael moved back to his 
grandmother's, occasionally writing 
and visiting his mother. Three days 
before Christmas 1986, Patty called 
her son to ask if she could move in 
with him. With two roommates, 
Michael didn't have space and reluc-
tantly said no. That was the last 
Michael heard from her. 

Frustrated by the gridlock in his 
mother's case, Michael opened his own 
investigation. "When I asked the New 
Haven Police what was going on with 
the case, they looked at me as if I 
should be telling them," he said. 
Michael walked the Kimberly Square 
streets searching for leads. 

On "the first anniversary of the 
murder, Michael called New Haven 
reporters to revive interest in the case. 
The media jumped on the story. Local 
TV and radio newscasts regularly fea-
tured segments on the unsolved 
"dugout murder." They noted that of 
the 23 murders in New Haven in 
1987, police had solved 22. Only 
Patty Konesky's case remained without 
a lead. The New Haven Register called 
her murder the most grisly crime of 
1987. Pressure mounted on the police 
to find a suspect. When the state 
offered a $20,000 reward for tips on 
the Konesky murder, Michael roamed 
through the Kimberly Square area 
posting signs with Patty's picture. 

The first break came two weeks 
later, when police arrested a friend of 
Patty's on prostitution charges. During 
routine 
questioning, 
Janice 
Tourangeau, a 40-year-old Kimberly 
Square regular, told police that she saw 
Phil Colton's son, Murray, and a sec-
ond unidentified man attack Konesky 
in the dugout. Tourangeau claimed 
that on the day of the murder she had 
begged Patty to let her in on a drug 
deal. When they met around midnight 
outside Don Phillip's, Patty told her to 
hide near the Kimberly Field dugout, a 
well-known drug den, and join her 
after she clinched the deal. 

From her view, behind a bush 
across the field from the dugout, 
Tourangeau claimed she saw Patty and 
Murray talking. Suddenly they both 
rose, and Murray struck Patty on the 
face. A second man sprung from 
behind the dugout and hit her from 
the back. As the men kicked Patty sav-
agely, Tourangeau said she fled the 
scene. 

Tourangeau worked as a prostitute 
on Kimberly Square to support her 
heroin habit. Far from the ideal wit-
ness, she was a product of the same 
drug culture as Patty. "Most of our 
informants tend to be involved with 
some criminal activity,,.. said Lt. 
Waring. "You can't know about crime 
unless you're close to it." Though 
Tourangeau conceded that she came 
forward for the reward money, she told 
police that she didn't really need it 
because she could hustle $2000 a week 
on the streets. At first, the police didn't 
believe her story. But it was the only 
lead in the murder, a.nd the police took 
what they could get. 

Once Tourangeau broke Kimberly 
Square's collective silence on the case, 
two new witnesses told the police that 
they had seen Patty walking with 
Murray in the direction of Kimberly 
Field at around midnight the night of 
the murder. A friend.of Towrangeau's 
claimed that the next night while 
watching a report about an unidenti-
fied woman murdered at Kimberly 
Field, Tourangeau had blurted out 
"that's Patty Konesky." 

Testimony by Murray Colton's ex-
girlfriend, Mariana Foster, proved 
more damning still. Colton had taken 
Foster to Don Phillip's on a date, beag-
ging that he owned the bar. When he 
conceded that he was only running the 
bar until his father finished serving 
time in prison, Murray explained, 
"Some bitch dropped a dime on my 
father-we took care of her, she got 
hers." 

But cracks developed in the prose-
cution's case when a friend of 
Tourangeau's told police that they had 
been together that night, and 
Tourangeau couldn't have seen the 
dugout murder. Jackie Boyles claimed 
that she and Tourangeau went on a 
heroin binge that day, partying at the 
Fremont Hotel all night. Despite the 
contradictory testimony, the state 
forged ahead in Murray Colton's pros-
ecution. The trial opened in the spring 
of 1990. With the conflicting stories 
of Tourangeau and Boyles, the jury 
voted 9 to 3 to convict Colton, but 
without the requisite unanimous ver-
dict the judge declared a mistrial. A 
second prosecution began in the fall, 
with similar evidence presented by 
both sides. The second jury came back 
with 9 to 3 vote to acquit. 

The prosecution knew they had to 
win the third trial because the state 
wouldn't foot the bill for a fourth. 
New attorneys represented both sides. 
The state prosecutor, Jim Clark, 
believed that he could get a conviction 
with the right jury and additional wit-
nesses. But Murray Colton's new 
lawyer, Ken Rosenthal, seemed equally 
determined to show the weakness of 
the state's case, based on the question-
able testimony of Janice Tourangeau. 

Defense attorney Rosenthal aimed 
to destroy Tourangeau's credibility 
with the jury. During his cross-exami-
nation, Rosenthal hammered ques-
tions at Tourangeau until she burst 
into tears. He demanded to know why 
she hadn't called for help or told her 
story until after the state offered the 
$20,000 reward. "I felt guilty for a 
long time for not calling anybody," she 
said, sobbing on the stand. In excruci-
ating detail Rosenthal portrayed 
Tourangeau as a conniving heroin 
addict and prostitute willing to do 
anything to get the reward money. 
"Their case rises and falls on the testi-
mony of this ad mined liar, this prosti-
tute, this junkie," Rosenthal told 
jurors. 

Rosenthal's hardball tactics to dis-
credit the informant seemed more like 
character assassination than defense. 
Prosecutor Clark attacked the local 
media for publicizing Tourangeau's 
"ancient history." Reportedly, she suf-
fered bouts of depression because of 
the intense media scrutiny during the 
three Colton trials. The N~w Havm 
Advocau ran a cover story reporting 
that Tourangeau was suicidal during 
her testimony in the first trial. "Janice · 
Tourangeau came forward and all the 
press wanted to do was trash her back-
ground, instead of looking at the per-
son who helped us get a vicious killer 
off the streets," said prosecutor Clark. 

New witnesses called by Clark sal-
vaged 
Tourangeau's 
reputation. 
Herbert Lee, a renowned forensic sci-
entist, told the court that his blood 
splaner analysis bore out Tourangeau's 
claim that two assailants attacked 
Konesky and that the victim lay on the 
ground for most of the attack. Most 
significantly, Lee's testimony con-
firmed that Konesky's skull fractures 
were consistent with kicks to the head. 
"Everyone knows that Konesky was 
stabbed 248 times. Tourangeau's story 
doesn't mention knives. If you wanted 
to frame someone for this murder your 
story would have knives in it," said 
prosecutor Clark. 

Lee displayed 24 color slides to 
illustrate his analysis in court. Michael 
Konesky bolted from his seat in the 
courtroom twice during the slide 
show. "It was the most difficult part of 
the trial. To see someone stabbed 248 
times, enlarged on a projection screen, 
is the most disgusting thing you could 
see in your life. Let alone that this per-
son was my mother. It made me sick." 

But the testimony of Murray's 
own father devastated the defense case. 
Phil Colton claimed that he and his 
son had been estranged since his drug
