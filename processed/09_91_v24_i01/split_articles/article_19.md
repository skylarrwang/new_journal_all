Advertisers are feeding women a line, 
saying that this concept of beauty is all 
men want. The more men distance 
themselves from the beauty myth, the 
better off we'll all be." 
But ultimately, Wolf wants 
women to free themselves. ''I'm hop-
ing that speaking up will make it easier 
for thousands of women to speak out 
across the country. I certainly don't 
think I'm alone. But we're up against 
something insidious on college cam-
puses, where women's struggle has 
been marginalized into women's stud-
ies and women's centers." 
Wolf finds the problem particular-
ly acute at Yale. Because coeducation 
occurred so recently, she charges that 
women's lives and concerns fall victim 
to indifference and neglect. "Women 
are still only five percent of the 
tenured faculty," she says. "Yale sits 
passively by while one-fifth of its 
women starve themselves. The institu-
tion welcomes our brains but rejects 
our bodies." 
Wolf continues to fight for the 
day when Yale and all of society accept 
women for themselves. She is trying to 
finish her dissertation-on how male 
and female writers use concepts of 
beauty in 19th century English litera-
ture. But she hopes to start a young 
feminists' forum for the New York 
Times. She has solicited articles from 
women like screenwriter Callie 
Khouri, author of Thelma and Louise. 
Wolf hopes that high-profile, self-pos-
sessed young feminists will break 
down the stereotypes of 60s feminists 
and launch a new movement of their 
own. "There's room in feminism for a 
plurality of viewpoints, from separa-
tion to assimilation," Wolf says. "If 
women don't like the way feminism is 
being defined, they should take it back 
for themselves."

Reviewers, I think, have missed 
two important points in their energet-
ic efforts to demonstrate just how far 
short Wolf falls of Friedan. First, they 
have overlooked a shortcoming that 
The Feminine Mystique and The Beauty 
Myth share-one that makes Naomi 
Wolf an excellent candidate to fill 
Betty Friedan's pumps. Second, they 
don't give Wolf enough credit for try-
ing to start a "third wave" of feminism, 
even if she is misguided in her assess-
ment of what might spark that wave. 
As to the similarities between The 
Beauty Myth and The Feminine 
Mystique, both books call for a 
renewed commitment to feminism bur 
make their cases by examining the 
plight of elite, educated women. Any 
revolution that either of these books 
spawns probably will exclude a broad
