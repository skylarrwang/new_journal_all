F
our years at Yale left Naomi Wolf (BK '84) with some-
thing of an identity crisis. "It's a co-ed institution but 
a male culture," she says. "There's a willful excising of 
women from the literary and historical record at Yale." Wolf 
saw women excluded everywhere--from the statues around 
campus, from the ranks of tenured faculty, from Donald 
Kagan's course on Classical Greece. "He left women out of 
antiquity," she claims. "It's like they were never there." 
Wolf worked hard to earn a place in Yale's academic tra-
dition. She graduated with honors as an English major and 
won a Rhodes Scholarship for good measure. She thought 
she'd made it in the Ivy League world. She thought she'd be 
accepted as just one of the brains. 
She was wrong. One evening at Oxford a male student 
casually remarked that she'd won the Rhodes only because 
of her looks. "I talked to other women Rhodes Scholars, 
c7 never suggested theres something 
wrong with adornment, with 
looking good. " 
and they'd all had the same experience," Wolf says. "I began 
to realize that mine was not an isolated experience, but that 
this was systemic. This is the way men relate to intelligent 
women. In male centers like Yale and Oxford, we're always 
being asked to apologize for power with beauty." 
The incident so rankled Wolf that she abandoned her 
doctoral dissertation for two years to immerse herself in 
research about women and beauty. And in the end, she 
became convinced that a conspiracy exists to keep women 
enslaved to beauty, away from the corridors of power. "The 
conspiracy acts as hypnosis to keep women from con-
fronting material issues," she claims. 
Wolf depicts that conspiracy in Th~ &auty Myth: How 
lmag~s of B~auty Art> Used Against WOmm. She contends that 
during the 1960s, when women asserted their indepen-

dence and found an identity outside the home, society had 
to create something new to keep them subjugated. While 
society has always valued a woman's beauty as her most pre-
cious asset, the trend persists today in more subtle, yet 
destructive, ways. "The beauty myth has gotten more dan-
gerous over the centuries," Wolf claims. "What makes it dif-
ferent from corsets or foot-binding is that we're supposed to 
be free now." 
Accord ing to Wolf, the diet and cosmetics industries 
gave birth to the modern beauty myth, which flourished in 
the new image culrure of television, videos, and glossy fash-
ion magazines. She claims that the beauty myth has devas-
tated affluent women in the United States and Europe. "In 
cultures where material constraints like poverty keep 
women down, the beauty myth is tangential," she says. 
"Where women get rich, something has to keep them from 
acting rich." By forcing women to pursue an unattainable 
ideal of beauty, American society robs them of their time 
and energy, stalling the women's movement. "Activism takes 
energy and self-esteem," Wolf says. 
Wolf, who nearly died of anorexia when she was 13 
years old, found writing The Beauty Myth cathartic. "It was 
an incredibly liberating experience," she says. "Bright young 
women in our culture are always made to feel that their 
achievements are not enough, that they can't base their 
identity solely on their will and hard work." 
Wolf's ideas evidently have struck a nerve among 
women. Her book, published this spring, hit the bestseller 
lists in both the United States and Britain, .and its 28-year-
old author has become a media star. Ms. magazine excerpted 
her work, and Tim~ analyzed Wolf in a full-page profile 
before her book even hit the stores in the U.S. In a few 
short months, Th~ Btauty Myth topped the heap as one of 
the most talked-about femin ist polemics since Betty 
Friedan's Tht hminint Mystiqut. "Much of what she was 
saying didn't sound new to me, but for younger women ir 
may have come as a fresh revelation," says Yale history pro-
fessor Cynthia Russett, who once taught Wolf in a course
