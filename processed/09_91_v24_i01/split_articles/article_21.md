I
t took more than a month for mi dreams to reflect my 
life in the Philippines. It didn't matter what I'd seen or 
done in those dramatically nc:_w surroundings; I could 
count on old friends to accompany me in my dreams at 
night. Every time I fell asleep, vivid scenes would feature the 
cast of family and friends I had left in the States. When the 
Philippines finally did seep into my mind, the comforting 
and familiar plots of my dreams changed long before the 
characters did. 

I moved to Manila in October, 1989. I had been an 
infrequent visitor in the past, my travels there never lasting 
more than a few weeks. This time I planned to stay a while. 
Perhaps three years, maybe longer. Having worked as a 
reporter in Washington since I left Yale, I couldn't tell 
whether I was becoming disenchanted with covering the Â· 
federal government or with journalism itself. I hoped that 
the new environment would feed my curiosity and boost 
my waning enthusiasm. In any case, I was looking for an 
adventure. 

As it turned out, I came home from the Philippines 
only four months after leaving. In many ways, I felt as if I 
had never gone away. Nothing appeared to have changed in 
my absence; I was not a Rip van Winkle returning to an 
unrecognizable home. Nevertheless, I no longer fit comfort-
ably into the space I had occupied. The short trip had given 
me an opportunity to reflect on my life, and as I continue 
to be shaped by the decisions I made in Manila, I always 
will be reminded of the importance of those brief months. 

The experience is why I am not now reporting in a 
newsroom, but sitting in a lecture hall in my first week of 
medical school classes. 

A peculiar culture thrived in Manila. Prominent 
national newspaper editors and political columnists gath-
ered several times a week to gossip with former politicians 
and military leaders who remained well-connected and 
powerful. Invited to some of these informal and innocuous-
looking assemblies in popular hotel coffee lounges, I heard 
casual speculation about upcoming plans to overthrow the 
civilian government by military coup. Media-crazed indi-
viduals aggressively sought interviews with me. They 
believed they would inherit power after the government fell 
and their reputations would improve if the foreign, and in 
particular the U.S., press rook their ideas seriously enough 
to print. 

Although at times the attention I received as a reporter 
\\as distasteful, I generally enjoyed the advantages that came 
with my srarus. My U.S. press credentials gave me authority 
to ask questions of people generally inaccessible to the pub-
lic, while my Filipino heritage, family, and friends gave me 
intimate access to the culture. The combination helped me 
both as a foreign correspondent and as I tried to learn about 
the country in which my mother was raised. The dual alle-
giance, however, later undermined my success as a journalist. 

Did my role as an observer satisfY me? 
Did my career reflect my values? 

Just four weeks after I heard rhe first rumors of military 
rebellion, thousands of frustrated soldiers staged a violent 
coup that came perilously close to overthrowing President 
Corazon Aquino's government. I watched from my bed-
room window at dawn one morning as World War II vin-
tage 'Iora-Tora planes flew over che military base across the 
Street from my uncle's house, dropping their earth-shaking 
loads on the burning buildings beneath them. 

Pleased to have something \vorthwhile to report on, I 
updated my editors in the Scares every hour by phone. I 
thought I had an important role in a dramatic event.

anti-aircraft gunfire. Confrontations 
between rebel- and government-con-
trolled tanks destroyed office buildings 
across the highway. Fighting grew 
fierce and killed dozens of civilians. 
U.S. warplanes criss-crossed over the 
city to show support for the Aquino 
government and to intimidate the 
mutineers. 

New to war, I couldn't imagine 
when or how it would end. Like a child 
who believes that she will always 
emerge u nscathed from dangerous 
p redicaments, I observed the events 
with some detachment. T he sense of 
security that came with being a U.S. 
newspaper reporter added to my per-
ception that I was invulnerable. 

Despite irs proximity, the war 
remained a distant notion to me. I 
could have been watching a movie. 
Little by little, however, the movie-like 
veneer of my experience dissolved. My 
frightened young cousins began crying; 
my aunt and her mother prayed aloud 
for the fighting to stop. Because battles 
had been waged before in my relatives' 
middle-class neighborhood during 
other coup attempts, my uncle recog-
nized that rhe fighting this rime would 
nor end by nightfall. We packed our 
bags and left. 

When we returned three days later, 
we fou nd o ur neighborhood ran-
sacked. Rebel troops and government 
forces both had used it as their head-
quarters. Some houses had been 
destroyed and looted, their windows 
b roken and walls riddled with bullet 
holes. Dried pools of blood marred 
kitchen floors. Government soldiers

filled narrow residential streets; they 
toted machine guns, rode tanks, and 
cleaned howitzers. Overwhelmed by 
the sight, I walked among the troops 
but couldn't bring myself to speak to 
them. I felt like a visitor on another 
planet. 

Although the coup was put down. 
after one week, it left an indelible 
impression on me. I felt embarrassed 
by my earlier cavalier reaction to the 
uprising. War and its accompanying 
uncertainties were no longer remote 
concepts. By the time I could sleep 
again, even my dreams had absorbed 
the chaos and instability surrounding 
me. In them, friends and family from 
home split into hostile gangs that ran 
through the streets, senselessly hunting 
each other down. Terrified and help-
