SEPTEMBER 6, 1991 
Last May. Garry TrtH-kau (DC 70), social critic and creator of 
the cartoon Doonesbury, ushered the class of 1991 into the real 
world. Whik George Bush and his attendant helicopters, secret 
service agents, and protesters furnished some competition, 
Trudeau's speech carried the Commencement weekend. Because 
so many of our readers could not be among the thousands on 
Old Campus for the chaos and circumstance of 1991 s 
Commencement Exercises, we excerpt the following from 
Trut:kau's Class Day Remarks:

God save us, The Permanently 
Housed at Home: 

In the spirit of the new plurality, I 
thought I'd begin today by trying to 
offend all of you all at once, in lieu of 
my usual practice of offending small, 
informal groups as I go along. If I have 
inadvertently left anyone out, I natu-
rally apologize for my insensitivity. 
I'd like to speak to you today 
about questions. About pertinent 
questions and impertinent questions. 
And where you might expect them to 
lead you. Of course, a lot of noise is 
part of the bargain. Outrageous decla-
rations and accusations will invariably 
fill the air. But I would argue that 
that's the whole point of a university-
it is a sanctuary where disputatiousness 
should not only be tolerated, it should 
be cherished. The university in this 
country has always been ahead of the 
curve-a subversive, trendy, noisy 
harbinger-a permanent California of 
the mind. 

That the national media have 
shown such concern of late about the 
state of civility on American campuses 
says more about the moral fatigue of 
middle-aged editors than the decline 
of tolerance on the quadrangles. Not 
that civility isn't a desirable social 
virtue-it is-but new ideas will 
always seem unruly and overstated, 
will always seem impertinent. When 
the founding fathers conceived of the 
First Amendment, it was not their 
intention to guarantee the right of any 
speaker to a respectful and tolerant 
audience. (Indeed, at the time, such 
audiences were rare.) Rather, they sim-
ply sought to protect the speaker from 
the censure of his government. 

What's lacking in the media's cur-
rent outcry is a sense of proportion. 
We are not talking about anything 
even remotely resembling a militant 
imposition of conformity in campus 
life. New York Magazinls Nazi book-
burning analogy does violence to both 
reason and history. Indisputably, there 
are ideologues on campuses today 
(what vanguard was ever rife with 
moderates?)-but they are found in 
abundance on both sides of current 
disputes (as the media would rediscov-
er if they checked their own clip files 
of only two years ago). 

The fact is, most of the new advo-
cates for change are not the scary cre-
ations currently haunting the public 
imagination. Many have made valu-
able and positive contributions to uni-
versity life. Moreover, what has been 
overlooked is that the traditionalists 
and the mulciculturalists have been co-
existing on most campuses for years. 

None of which is to downplay the 
natural tension that exists between the 
two. No doubt each of you at one time 
or another has felt intimidated by the 
struggle for the moral high ground. 
No one likes to be called a sexist. And 
what makes these epithets so difficult 
to refute is that they seem to contain 


within them an implied immunity 
from the burden of proof. 

Don't believe it. Reverse prejudice 
does exist, an<:{ it must be engaged as 
forcefully as the bigotry that is its pro-
genitor. To say that something is a 
black thing, or an Asian thing, or a 
female thing, and the outsiders 
wouldn't understand is to argue 
against the whole rationale of your lib-
eral arts education. 

Whether one studies Greek 
drama, Mayan architecture or 20th-
century Chinese politics, the whole 
point of your inquiry is to endeavor to 
see the world as others have perceived 
it. One's remoteness from the experi-
ence only argues for its enhanced value 
as a means for enlightenment. 

The white scholar who rules out a 
career in African history or the black 
scholar who feels pressure not to study 
and teach Shakespeare cheats not only 
the self but a future generation of stu-
dents who might be infected by his or 
her passion. 

When a distinguished black play-
wright argued in the N~ York Tim~s 
last year that a film of his work could 
only be made by a black director, he 
confounded his admirers. Never mind 
that the presence of women characters 
in his work made him vulnerable to 
his own logic-he seemed to have for-
gotten that the very task of fiction is 
about trying to characterize people 
who are not the author. 

Indeed, this is an essential truth of 
all art, not only in the creation of it, 
but in its subsequent appreciation. 
The need to empathize--and to share 
that empathy-is what makes learning 
and teaching. It is what drives the 
study of what we consider the classical 
canon of any culture. 

The good intentions of the young 
have always defined university life. 
Indeed, generations are characterized 
by their common moral debate. The 
indignant media mandarins might do 
well to remember that P.C. was alive 
and well during their years in college 
too. It wasn't called that then, but the 
campus liberation and anti-war move-
