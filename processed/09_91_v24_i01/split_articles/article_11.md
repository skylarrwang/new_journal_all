have not been in support of coeduca-
tion," Forster said. "I was definitely 
against it 15 years ago, but my support 
has warmed up over the years." 


Although Foster's views may have 
changed, single-sex diehards like Tom 
Sargent still have the ear of the Wolf's 
Head leadership. In a heartfelt letter to 
Forster [reprinted at right], he recalls 
his Wolf's Head experience with nos-
talgic fondness. As the father of two 
boys and a girl, Sargent wants to pre-
serve the all-male experience at the 
Hall for his sons, and would like to see 
his daughter join an all-female club. 


"I'd definitely like my son to be a 
member of an all-male society. It 
would be an experience he wouldn't 
get anywhere else," Sargent said. 
"Some of my classmates who were in 
other senior societies [that have gone 
coed since they graduated] said that in 
the coed environment, the experience 
was lost." 


Sargent hesitates to break with the 
past. Without experiencing coeduca-
tion personally, he fears the unknown 
for Wolf's Head. "To coeducationalize 
the experience would change it," 
Sargent said. "Not necessarily for the 
worse-it would just be different. " 


Many of the older alums are happy 
with the way Wolf's Head is. They do 
not want to concede Yale's last male 
bastion. 


But recently, pressure to admit 
women has increased dramatically. 
Skull and Bones was not the only 
society considering coeducation last 
spring. Wolf's Head voted on admit-
ting women last year too--but its pro-
posal failed. The Bones decision has 
forced the issue again this fall. Forster 
believes that times have changed at 
Yale, and that coeducation now stands 
a better chance of passing than it has 
before. 


With their ballots this October, 
members will receive a recommenda-
tion from the committee on coeduca-
tion. The committee decided against 
the usual method of including four 
"position papers" to spell out a spec-
trum of arguments. "I think people

really know the issues by now," Forster 
said. "We just want to make it as sim-
ple as possible." The details of the rec-
ommendation are anyone's guess. 


"Basically the committee is in support 
of coeducation," Forster added. 
"Obviously, there are degrees of opi~-

ion, but the committee is in agree-
ment." 


Before Sam Chauncey resigned 
from the Hall, he proposed a "last 
resort" coeducation package that 
would have doubled the size of the tap 
class to include 15 men and 15 
women. Chauncey suggested that the 
men and women meet separately once 
a week. Then half the men and half 
the women would meet together on 
alternate Sundays. Ironically, Tom 
Sargent resurrected the major points of 
the plan earlier this year. "If the push 
to conformity is so great, then perhaps 
the way around this is to have two del-
egations and to share the building," 
Sargent said. "They could meet sepa-
rately for the personal histories and co-
mingle at other events." 


Such a compromise disappoints 
hard-liners on both sides of the coedu-
cation issue. It satisfies neither the pas-
sion of those who see the issue as an 
unambiguous fight against discrimina-
tion, nor the equally intense feelings of 
those who do not want their successors 
to miss the benefits of the hallowed 
"all-male experience."

Dear Chris Forster: 
From my son, now a sophomore 
at Yale, I am following with 
great interest the •problems• at 
Skull & Bones. When and if we 
are the last to be all-male, the 
pressure to conform will esca-
late geometrically. 


There is an obvious role and 
need for an all-male experience 
like we all shared at the Hall. 
The pressures to conform are 
great in college, and the egali-
tarian spirit will never be 
quite the same as during this 
phase of life; however, 
the 
experience of Wolf's Head would 
never be the same either in a 
heterosexual environment, much 
to the detriment of the delega-
tion. The setting, the mood, the 
ambience, the camaraderie of the 
individuals would all be the 
different . And •different• is 
the operative word here. Thus 
will pass, once and for all, the 
opportunity for young men to 
share their innermost thoughts, 
aspirations, fears and dreams 
with each other in a unique and 
supportive environment. 


They 
don't know that yet, but some 
day at least some of them will. 
And it cuts both ways, which is 
why I would favor separate dele-
gations as the ultimate •solu-
tion• to the coed issue. 


The trend of the voting of 
the Association's membership, 
coupled with being the last of 
the societies to be all male, 
means that very soon Wplf's Head 
will join all the others at Yale 
and conform. In my view much 
will be lost by the Yale men and 
little gained by the Yale women 
other than to change the Wolf's 
Head experience from what it was 
to something entirely different. 


Yours in W.H.S.,
