asting themselves in Senator Lloyd Bentsen's role at 
the 1987 vice-presidential debates, book reviewers 
across the land have stared down Naomi Wolf and 
told her that they know Betty Friedan- and she is no Betty 
Friedan. 
Like Dan Quayle (the target of the original remark), 
Wolf (BK '84), author of the recently published feminist 
polemic Th~ &auty Myth, begs the comparison. Recalling 
Friedan's unhappy homemaker in the 60s blockbuster Th~ 
F~minin~ Mystiqu~. Wolf writes that in the 80s "the gaunt, 
youthful model supplanted the happy housewife as the 
arbiter of successful womanhood." Just when women man-
aged to break down professional and personal barriers, a 
male-dominated, anti-feminist culture manufactured new 
obsessions to keep women from enjoying their hard-earned 
jobs, salaries, and sexual freedoms. 
Feminism has stalled, Wolf argues, because young 
women, exhausted from simultaneously overachieving at 
work and battling fat and wrinkles at home, lack the energy 
to demand equal pay or affordable childcare. Just as their 
mothers had to overcome exhortations to wash whiter 
whites, these young women in the 90s must overcome 
media-induced pathological obsessions with body size and 
shape. 
Reviewers, including playwright Wendy Wasserstein 
(MFA '76) and Friedan herself, have belittled Wolf's 
attempt to equate the policicizacion of beauty with women's 
oppression, or what Friedan called "the problem that has no 
name." What is this talk of dimpled flesh and low self-
esteem, reviewers seem to ask. Haven't we got better things 
to worry about? Writing for the Los Ang~iuTim~s, 
Wasserstein echoes these sentiments. Wolfs argument, she 
writes, is interesting but ultimately "not earth-shaking"-
and it cerrainly can't hold a candle to Th~ F~minin~ 
Mystiq~'s potential to spark a revolution.
