**Title: A Critique of Naomi Wolf's *The Beauty Myth***
**Author: Cathy Corman**
**Page number(s): 33**

W
ile I feel compelled to 
efend Wolf's ideas, much 
emains to criticize. The 
book is wildly uneven, a sociological 
mishmash of random data and razor-
sharp, first-person observations that a 
devoted editor might have streamlined 
into a 
focused 
tour 
d~ fora. 
Unimpeded by such an edicor, Wolf 
lumbers along, bolstering her argu-
ments with strings of unsurprising 
statistics gleaned from contemporary 
newspapers and magazines. The over 
kill of Wolf's scaciscics leaves me posi-
tively dizzy when she explains that 
women work twice as hard as men. 
Does she really need to offer no less

than cwo dozen unrelated bits of infor-
macion to convince me that most men 
don't do housework? 
In an effort co keep the statistics 
under control, Wolf cries to sweep 
facts and figures into tidy piles, each of 
which she labels with a cutesy catch-
phrase, making her prose sound per-
ilously like the ad copy she repudiates. 
The most irritating-Iron Maiden, 
Beauty Back.Jash, Professional Beauty 
Quotient, Church of Beauty, and The 
One Stone Solution-serve as vacuous 
signposts. I have a hunch that the 
phrases serve as a kind of internal 
shorthand for Wolf, but they only 
confuse readers, who constantly have 
to refresh their memories as to what 
these phrases mean. 
The catch phrase that troubled me 
most was the Beauty Mych, itself. 
Three hundred and fifty pages of text 
from scare co finish, and I still do not 
understand how Wolf's paradigm

works as myth. In the popular press, 
writers use "myth" interchangeably 
with "lie" (as in: it's a myth that 
women derive more sexual pleasure 
from men with large penises). On one 
hand, Wolf doesn't use the media's def-
inition of myth-and yet, she doesn't 
employ a more traditional, academic 
definition either. Although she makes 
passing reference in an endnote to 
myth theorist Bronislaw Malinowski 
and says several times chat the Beauty 
Myth tells a story, the story itself 
remains unclear. 
Women are told (and Wolf never 
makes clear by whom) the "lie" that 
success and power belong to the beau-
tiful, which these days translates as 
young and rail-thin. Like Susan 
Brownmiller's "femininity," the Beauty 
Myth is a powerful cultural construct 
that shapes women's sense of them-
selves. Wolf does a good job of 
describing how women consume that 
construct, but she never explains how 
the construct is produced. Her inabili-
ty to explain cultural production car-
ries over to the final pages of the book, 
when she asks readers co make a "new 
myth" -to redefine beauty in healthi-
er, more realistic terms. Although she 
writes that women can "provoke" a 
mass culture by becoming bored with 
standard images of beauty, she offers 
little in the way of concrete suggestion 
as to how to bring about this provoca-
tion. One possibility, communal 
nakedness, struck me as positively 
nutty. 
Who really knows what it would 
take to "provoke" a whole new culture? 
Wolf doesn't have the answer, but 
maybe that's not so important. I hope, 
even if she doesn't provoke a new cul-
ture or a third wave, she'll at least have 
provoked readers' anger at a misogy-
nistic culture.
