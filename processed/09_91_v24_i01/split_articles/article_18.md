on women in America. "I was really 
surprised at how much it was discussed-it was a publishing event." 

Not all of the media hype has 
favored Wolf. Critics charge her with 
hyperbole, especially in comparing the 
-eating disorders epidemic to the 
Holocaust. Older feminists have criticized 
the book for lacking originality. 
Author Susan Brownmiller discussed 
the same themes in her book 
F~mininity, written nearly two decades 
ago. "When I read The B~auty Myth in 
galley proofs, I had a very personal 
reaction to it, because I felt like I'd written 
it before," Brownmiller recalls. "But 
I didn't disagree with anything she said, 
and it's always nice when someone new 
says things over again and adds a new 
perspective to the issues." 

Other critics attack Wolf for ignoring 
women's role in perpetuating the 
beauty myth. "I probably should have 
devoted more time to that," Wolf 
admits. "Women have always been 
used to police other women-it's standard-
issue patriarchal practice. But 
everyone is blaming women right now. 
I wanted to get away from that." 

By far the most stinging criticism 
of Th~ B~auty Myth has come from 
Betty Friedan, the mother of the 1960s 
women's movement, who attacked 
Wolf as anti-beauty. "As a good old 
feminist," Friedan wrote this spring in 
Ailur~ magazine, "let me say categorically 
that I do not believe ... feminism 
requires turning your back on love, 
men, marriage, children or even the 
frivolous desire to adorn and attract." 

Friedan's criticism both surprised 
and confused Wolf. "I just 
wish she'd attacked me for a book I'd 
written," Wolf says. "I never suggested 
there's something wrong with 
adornment, with looking good. I 
don't hate beauty. The bad part 
about the beauty myth is not when a 
woman puts on eyeshadow. The bad 
part is when she gets or loses a job 
because she puts on eyeshadow. The 
bad part is when she feels invisible 
without it."

Wolf attributes part of Friedan's 
criticism to a generational gap among 
feminists. "The difference between 
the 1960s and now is image culture," 
she says. "That's a material force in our 
lives, and it's something women like 
Betty Friedan can't understand." 

Indeed, Wolf and her theories are 
riding a wave of popularity among 
young women. Across the country, as 
she speaks at schools, appears on talk 
shows, and grants interviews to 
newspapers, women confess their 
beauty nightmares to her. "Probably 
two-thirds of the journalists who 
have interviewed me admitted they 
once had an eating disorder," Wolf 
says. "I get letters saying 'You saved 
me from having a face-lift,' or 'I was 
just able to eat my first meal in three 
years with your book propped in 
front of me."' 


Wolf claims that her book has 
affected not just individuals but also 
society as a whole. In Th~ Beauty Myth 
she takes aim at the false claims of the 
-cosmetics industry; two weeks after 
her book appeared, the Food and 
Drug Administration announced a 
crackdown on such advertising, after 
turning a blind eye to it for 40 years. 
"And images of women in magazines 
are starting to change," Wolf says. "I 
think the editors of women's magazines 
are having their consciousness 
raised." 

Wolf hopes that the controversy 
she has engendered will provoke a 
"third wave" of feminism among 
young women in America-and 
among young men. "I don't target 
male sexuality or men, just men in 
institutions," she says. "I think men 
can do a lot to dispel the beauty myth.
