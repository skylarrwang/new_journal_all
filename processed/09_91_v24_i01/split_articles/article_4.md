n our lead piece, Garry Trudeau exhorts Yale students to ask the 
impertinent question. «I would argue that that's the whole 
point of a university," he says. «It is a sanctuary where disputa-
tiousness should not only be tolerated, it should be cherished." The 
New journal strives to live up to Trudeau's advice and sound the 
depths of the community in which we live. Our articles this month 
take you from Capitol Hill to New Haven's Kimberly Square. 
Do the New Haven Police sacrifice lives to fight the drug epi-
demic? Our look at the 1987 murder ofPatty Konesky has made us 
wonder whether police payoffs to informants unecessarily endanger 
their lives. Should Wolf's Head continue to exclude women? In our 
article about Yale's last all-male secret society, we ask whether 
women would improve Wolf's Head or destroy it. Has Yale ever 
really accepted women in its midst? Two articles about Naomi 
Wolf's The Beauty Myth examine the theory that traditional institu-
tions still view women as outsiders. 

It may seem in this issue that women get most of the press, but 
The New journals scope encompasses all of Yale and New Haven. 
We write about the vibrant community that surrounds us, through 
profiles, opinion pieces, and good old-fashioned investigative 
reporting. 

You too can get in on the action. The New journal is looking for 
writers, designers, photographers, artists, computer whizzes, and 
born salesmen for our business staff. Join us at our organizational 
meeting on Tuesday, September 1Oth at 7 p.m. in the Calhoun 
College Foord Lounge. We want to hear your ideas.
