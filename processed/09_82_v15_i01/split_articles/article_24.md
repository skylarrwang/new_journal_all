"what's the matter with me?" 
"Don't you th ink th at's because of 
the pressure?" 
"No, the pressure is really off me 
now. At first, it was pressured ... 
When I was in my heyd ay last year, 
working everyday for GQ, Glamour, 
or Vogue, Dan said to me, 'It's great 
right now, you're getting a lot of 
recognition, you feel good , you're 
making a lot money but soon you are 
not going to be the new top guy. 
You're going to be up there still, maybe 
making more money, but your name 
won't be on th e tip of everyone's 
tongue.' H e was right, and all of a sud-
den, I wasn't the new guy." 
"That must have been depressing," I 
said. 
"No, not really. It happened so 
gradually that I wasn't depressed. I was 
just imp ressed 
that he had such 
foresight. I am making more money 
now. The magazines pay $200 a day, 
and other designers pay $2000." 
"That won't be easy to give up," I 
"It will be hard to take me away 
from it. I always think that would be 
the easiest way. Sometimes I have 
regrets. I wish that I hadn't done this, 
or that I was building a future. This 
l.eads you nowhere. That's sort of the 
justification for being paid a lot. 
Modeling ends and it's a temporary 
job. There really is not a future in it, 
unless you want to be an actor. But I 
don't want to do that. This will lead to 
something, I think. I don't worry about 
it, because everything just seems to fall 
into place. It will work out. I know it 
will."
