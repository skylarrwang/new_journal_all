EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
leader, I became too busy to remain a 
citizen. 

We're all so involved in writing our 
articles, 
researching our papers, 
finishing our problem sets, and striking 
our sets that we filter out all other 
things, including news of the outside 
world. Being well-informed requires a 
commitment of time and emotional 
energy, two things you just begin to 
run short on come midterms or finals, 
printer's deadline or opening night. 

When we do pick up the newspaper, 
we often still lack a sense of immediacy 
and importance. History, including 
that attempt to represent it on the 
printed page, appears as something 
outside of our world, something to 
study with a detached interest, and to 
write long papers about senior year. 

But as far as all these words actually affecting people, actually affecting our 
lives in a big way, it is hard to make 
that connection. The news has rarely 
had such a direct effect on our lives. 
We know there are people at war right 
now, soldiers shooting and killing one 
another. It's just not us or anyone we 
know. 

Perhaps that's why war seems like 
such a remote possibility even though I 
realize it's quite possible we could get 
into another war within the next ten 
years. I don't believe it will happen 
because it has never happened to me or 
to my father or to his grandfather. It is 
at once a definite and a remote 
possibility, one that fills me with fear 
but does not arouse my interest in 
world events. 

Some nights I walk by the Woolsey 
Rotunda and read the names of the 
Yale graduates killed in wars. Above 
the portal which most of us pass each 
day on our way to class, it says, "We 
who must live salute you who found 
the strength to die." I wonder how 
many of them really found the strength 
to die and how many were just caught 
in a current that pulled them under. 

The danger of being fortunate and 
sheltered is that you can lose a sense of 
your own vulnerability. You forget 
that no matter how intelligent, creative, 
and ambitious you are, you can 
be swallowed up as easily as others 
have been. What is it besides the arrogance of our age, and the complacency of our time that leads us to 
believe we will be exempted from the 
challenges and the traumas history has 
so continually put forth? What amazes 
is the ability of the status quo to erode 
our sense of possibility. 

If nothing else, perhaps it pays to 
muster sufficient selfishness and 
foresight to realize we are affected by 
what strangers do. This is not a matter 
of being liberal or idealistic or activist. 
It just means making room in your life 
for the world, and doing that, if for no 
other reason, simply because you are 
part of it. 

In December, The New Journal interviewed Kathleen Cleaver, a former 
Black Panther who came to Yale last 
year after living abroad with her husband Eldridge who had been a fugitive 
from justice. During the interview, I 
remarked that history hasn't really affected our generation the way it affected hers. 

"It hasn't clobbered us yet," I said. 

"Don't worry," she said. "You might 
get a chance for history to clobber you 
too."
