EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When Michael Ives began modeling 
during his sophomore year at Yale, 
everyone in the business told him he 
looked too Waspish to succeed. He was 
blond, blue-eyed and preppie. But 
though his features were classically 
handsome, they were softly askew, as 
though sculpted by a gentle hand As 
he opened his mail one morning, he 
paused to flip 
through 
a 
glossy 
catalogue. Each page he turned to 
revealed a picture of himself. In one, 
he was draped on a leather couch and 
he gazed at the camera, pouting. 
Beneath, a quote from Calvin Thomp-
son read, "Living well is the best 
revenge." In another, he posed beside a 
roaring fire, 
wearing a 
leather-
trimmed jacket and clasping a shotgun 
casually. Beneath, Herman Melville 
was quoted, "They talk of the dignity 
of work. Bosh. The dignity is in 
the leisure." He flipped through the pages, 
commenting on one or two as if 
criticizing a stranger. 
Pinned on the wall above him was a 
Dior ad which he had done last year. 
The overhead shot pictured him lying 
on a tussled bed beside a woman 
wrapped in fur with his head to her 
feet. They were laughing. A silk scarf 
was stretched tightly between 
them-one end in his teeth, the other 
in her hands. "It was fun to do," he 
said, "a fantasy, but not the kind of pic-
ture I would cherish." 

He showed me around the honey-
comb offices of the $14 million model-
ing agency. Rows and rows of framed 
Vogue and Glamour covers hung upon 
the president's office wall, along with

Quarterly cover, and his November 
1981 Linia Uomo cover. Michael was 
the only male model in the collection. 
The honor of being the 'top' model in 
the business is somewhat arbitrary, 
though, Michael said. "It's just like in 
an y business dependent on public op-
inion, like the recording business. If 
you and I had a band, we could write 
and sing beautiful songs, but until 
someone decided that we are 'it' we 
wouldn't be anything. We have control 
in that we can do our best, but until 
someone decides to make you, you are 
nothing." 

Leaving the agency, we headed for 
his assignment, a shooting for B. 
Altman's spring collection. Catalogues 
comprise two-thirds of his schedule. At 
Yale 
where 
Michael 
majored 
in 
English, rowed crew and considered 
teaching, he never thought that in his 
first full year after graduation in 1980, 
he would earn over $100,000. 
This year he will make even more. 
"I remember two years ago, when I 
was discovered," he said. "Dan Deeley, 
the head of the men's division, told me: 
'A year from now you're not going to 
be able to walk down the street without 
feeling self-conscious. People will point 
at you and you'll be working everyday.' 
I never thought it would happen but he 
was right." 

Instant recognition 
People often approach him and ask 
'aren't 
you 
Ives?' In 
restaurants, he often has to wait a little 
longer for a table because the maitre d' 
hotel wants to seat him in front. 
"Dan once told me: 'I don't want to 
see you getting drunk in public.' I 
understand why he said that now. The 
whole market is my public appeal. The 
reason that I am able to work a lot is 
that clients have found that my picture 
will sell their product to the public. 
When I go out, in effect, I am work-

ing. I never get away from it, unless I 
stay home." 

"Do people treat you like the image 
you project in magazines?" 
"Well, they automatically assume 
that I am conceited," he said. "But 
·when I talk to them then they are much 
nicer and more responsive. Then they 
admit, 'God, I expected you to be such 
an asshole.'" 

We arrived 
at an 
unobtrusive 
building on 42nd street. In the 
cramped third floor hall, he knocked 
on a soiled wooden door where a small 
nameplate was tacked which read, 
"Maury Hammond." In a moment, the 
door was opened by a short, balding 
man with a slight paunch wearing 
faded designer jeans. Maury ushered 
us in and shuffied back to his seat in his 
make-shift corner office. As we en-
tered, another male model, who re-
sembled a well-built doll with angular 
features, precise hair and wide eyes, 
was preparing to leave. He wrapped an 
aviator scarf nonchalantly about his 
neck and complimented Michael's 
hair. 
"What did you do with it?" Maury 
asked. 
Michael smiled, "I didn't do 
anything. Someone else cut it for me." 
In a raspy voice, Maury began to 
complain of models who cut their hair 
after the first session of a two-day shoot 
and returned the next day looking 
complerdv different. 
The l>tylist, a tnm woman v.tth a 
maternal air, gave Michael his first 
outfit from the 
racks of clothes.

work suits hung on th,e racks, each 
piece still tagged. Mtchael doesn't 
mind that he can't keep the clothes, 
since he is two inches taller than most 
models and can barely fit into most 
l)amples anyway. While he was chan· 
ging, the stylist ironed a handkerchief 
deftly, placed it in a suit pocket anc 
reached for her pins. When he ·came 
out, she straightened his collar an• 
smoothed his shirt briskly. 
Upon page thirty of B. Altman's 
Spring Catalogue, Michael Ives wears 
a cotton sweater in striped pastels, and 
tan chino pants. The camera would 
not, however, capture his rolled up 
cuffs, which haphazardly revealed his 
own white 
socks and battered 
moccasins. 
After snapping two Polaroids for the 
lay-outs, Maury took his camera and 
began to roam back and forth. He 
worked in silence. Only the whirl of his 
electric shutter was heard against the 
soft tones of the piped-in muzak. 
Michael perched on the edge of a white 
wooden cube, resting his elbow. His 
face froze in a rapid sequence of ex-
pressions-boyish grin, pensive stare, 
energetic laugh, sullen profile, like 
sli~es clicking on a projection screen. 
Later, I asked him what he thought 
about during the sessions. 
"I knew you would ask that," he 
laughed. "Nothing." 
After half an hour, Maury paused, 
scratched his head, uttered a sigh, and 
the assistant changed the position of 
the wooden blocks. Now, Michael 
leaned back, rested both elbows, and 
faced the camera. H e asked, "Are my 
hands OK?" Maury shrugged. "That's 
fine." Each rime Michael moved, the 
stylist jumped up to smooth his 
sweater or his sleeve. 
I wondered what the other models 
were like. 
"How can I generalize?" he said, 
"What are the students at Yale like? 

They're all so ditferent . . . Modeling 
certainly has a mystique about it. I 
think that's just because models are 
young kids who have a lot of money, 
do a lot of drugs and start going to 
fancy places and become the Beautiful 
People. Most of them are boring as 
shit, and stupid, too. But that's true in 
any business." 
"Is there a lot of competition be-
tween models?" 
"It feels pretty competitive at times. 
We don't compete for jobs, but to see 
who works more. A lot of it is unsaid, 
but I feel it. People will joke about it a 
lot, but underneath there's a hint of 
animosity." 
"What is the most dangerous trap for 
a model?" I asked. 
"Believing your own publicity," he 
said. "If you start to believe that you're 
special, and a lot of people in this 
business do, then you're in trouble. 
Because you're not. There are a lot of 
people in modeling who don't have a 
humble bone in their bodies." 
"Do you feel powerful?" 
"No, I don't feel powerful. I guess 
other people assume that you are. 
You're it. You personify taste and class 
and style. Sometimes it is scary, 
because ad men know that just power 
will sell. They show the guy who has 
the power, who is the center of atten-
tion. 
It'~ funny to be part of this 
advertising world, but it has always 
been interesting to me. But I know that 
it's not real. As you just saw, they pin 
the clothes and nothing fits and they 
have to cut the shoes so that my feet 
will fit in. I know it's all fake." We said 
goodbye to Maury and departed. 
From a newsstand on the street, 
Michael purchased a copy of the March 
issue of Gentleman's Qyarterly. We sat on 
the steps of the Public Library, looking 
through the articles instructing men 
how to be "On the Go," have an 
"Ultimate Scrub-Down," or be "Born 
Again" after an "Eleven Month Tune-
up." The ads spoke in virile 
superlatives of "conquering time," 
"having an edge on the competition" 
and "adding life to your style." 
On pages 50-55, he found the ads he 
had done in South America last Jan-
uary for Henry Grethal fashion. In 
each two-page spread, he and four 
other models were striding toward the 
camera confidently, smiling widely, 
their hands in pockets. Thick fertile 
palms stood in the distance. "It looks 
beautiful," he said, "but actually it was 
100° in the shade, and we were 
drenched in sweat. We were pretty 
sick, as a matter of fact, because of the 
squalor and dirt of the place. See that 
woman?" He pointed to a beautiful 
blonde with a vivacious grin. "She just 
got out of the hospital last week after
