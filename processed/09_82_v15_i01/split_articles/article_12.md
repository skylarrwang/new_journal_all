EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
members of the Yale community who 
knew Herrin and came to his aid did so 
as individuals, not as representatives of 
Yale. And although there is some ques-
tion about the capacity in which the 
chaplains at St. Thomas More House, 
the Catholic Church at Yale, acted on 
Herrin's behalf, the denominational 
groups here function independently of 
Yale's authority. Why should Yale 
have done other than it did- holding a 
memorial service for the Garlands, and 
then remaining silent as an institution? 
And was it really "the Yale murder" at 
all, except for purposes of selling 
books? 

A lot depends upon how one chooses 
to read Richard Herrin. If one buys 
the psychological scenario presented 
by Herrin's defense lawyer, and portrayed 
in Meyer's book, Herrin was a 
troubled youth who suffered a series of 
humiliations, academic and amorous, 
which he long repressed and finally 
vented in a moment of rage. If one 
subscribes 
to 
the 
prosecution's 
scenario, he was hurt, he decided to 
kill his girlfriend, he searched for a 
weapon, he used the weapon, and he 
later recounted with coherence and 
precision exactly what he had done. 

If Herrin did just act as a lover seeking 
vengeance, then perhaps it could 
have happened anywhere, regardless 
of where murderer and victim met and 
went to school. But if, as defense ex-
perts testified in court, one must con-
sider the whole psychological profile, 
then perhaps Yale did have something 
to do with it. 

"My feeling is had Richard Herrin 
not gone to Yale, stayed on the West 
Coast, stayed in an environment that 
was familiar to him, gone to a college 
that was less competitive, none of this 
would have happened," Meyer said. 
"He wouldn't have been in the kind of 
circumstances which challenged his

someone had inadvertently 
dumped a load of manure 
on its front lawn." 
whole being, everything about his 
background and lifestyle, and in effect 
humiliated him." 

The story 
Bonnie Garland and Richard Herrin 
met on Bladderball weekend, November, 
1974. He was a senior Geology 
major in Saybrook, a half-Mexican 
American from the barrio of East Los 
Angeles. She was a freshman with a 
beautiful voice who sang in the Glee 
Club and later helped found the singing 
group, Proof of the Pudding. She 
lived 
in a 
Tudor-style house in 
Scarsdale and 
was educated at 
Madeira. 

They 
were 
described 
as 
"inseparable" by Yale friends, and 
three weeks after they met, Garland 
moved in with Herrin. They spent a 
lot of time in their room together and 
did very poorly academically. After 
Herrin went on to a doctorate program

in Fort Worth while Garland remained 
in New Haven, they became engaged. 

In 1977, during her junior year, 
Garland went on tour with the Glee 
Club and started dating a Whiffenpoof. 
She didn't write Herrin for three 
weeks, while he wrote her at every stop 
along the tour. "I'm living every second 
for you now," one of his letters said. 

When Garland mailed a letter informing 
him she was involved with another 
man, she joked, "He'll probably kill 
me." 

Herrin flew to New York to meet 
Garland when she returned from 
Europe. He resolved to get a job in 
New Haven so that he would always be 
near her. It was on the second night of 
his stay in the Garland's home that it 
occurred to him that he had to kill Bon-
nie and then himself. He searched for a 
weapon, found a hammer downstairs 
and hit her head, throat, and chest 
while she was sleeping in her bedroom. 
He then drove away half-naked into 
the night, trying but not having the 
courage to kill himself, and eventually 
confessing to a priest in Coxsackie, 
New York, four hours later. 

When Scarsdale police arrived at 
Bonnie's home, 
her father, 
Paul 
Garland (Yale '52), had already left for 
work, but Joan Garland, her mother, 
awoke and said, "You must have the 
wrong house." She went upstairs and 
found her daughter beaten and bloody 
but still alive. 

Bonnie Garland died after intensive 
surgery and Richard Herrin, sat handcuffed 
to a chair in Coxsackie, New 
York, charged with murder. His 
friends from Yale, however, especially 
people he had known while playing 
guitar at St. Thomas More House, 
came to his aid. They raised $30,000 
for a lawyer. They wrote letters recommending 
him for bail and found a 
place where he could stay with a group 
of Christian Brothers in Albany which
