there to entertain." 
had written) out of the reach of Harvard spies, that he locked it away in his 
personal computer account the week 
before The Game. 
Parker's epithet, which has by and 
large displaced his real name, was 
coined four years ago: "I wore a black 
cape around freshman year and was 
just generally a 
weird person. 
Somebody came up with 'Dr. Death' 
and it stuck." Death's greatest claim to 
fame, apart from reading the halftime 
scripts and just generally being a weird 
person, was playing the gigantic pipe 
organ in Woolsey Hall for the Halloween 
Concert last year. Crouched over 
the organ with his long, spindly legs 
stabbing at the foot pedals and his wiry 
fingers climbing over the triple-deck 
keyboard, Death could have been the 
phantom of the opera. "It was the 
wildest thing I've ever done," he 
remembered. "There must have been 
3,000 drunk and tripping people 
dressed 
in every wild outfit imaginable, and they were listening to 
every note I played." 
the PMB claims that Princeton has 
been singularly rude in the past, persistently eating into the PMB's limited 
time slot, and nearly ruining a show on 
one occasion. 
The "obligatory" 
Princeton joke varies from year to 
year, said Death, but it is invariably 
vicious, and it usually has something to 
do with turnpike exits and industrial 
smells. 
As last year's announcer, Death had 
probably the most familiar voice on 
campus. Aside from a casual innuendo 
or a suggestive double entendre which 
might occasionally slide by, the Voice 
of Death stuck to broader themes of a 
less risque nature last year- themes 
like Reaganomics, or James Watt, or 
parents. But the band did observe what 
Dr. Death referred to as "obligatory" 
jokes. For example, tradition dictates 
that the band make at least some random reference to sheep during the 
Dartmouth show. It's sort of a conditioned response by now, a formality 
the band follows more out of habit than 
anything else. "These are just 
gratuitous 
sheep jokes," explained 
Death. "'God, they hate those. Every 
year we do one and every year you can 
hear the Dartmouth people squirming 
in their seats and screaming 'Oh no, 
not again!"' 
Another "obligatory" joke is what 
Death described as the "token, below-
the-belt Princeton joke." The PMB, it 
seems, has had a bit of a vendetta 
against the Princeton band which goes 
back years. Like most feuds, no one 
knows exactly how it all started, but 


It has been said that if John Philip 
Sousa were to take an aerial glimpse of 
one of the band's formations, he'd bail 
out without a parachute. David Polinsky 
would be the first to admit the band's 
imprecision, but he has never been in 
sympathy with the traditional Big-10 
bands, which he and others have summarily called "fascist." "We're not out 
there to march precisely," said Polinsky, "We're out there to entertain. I 
don't ever recall being precise, and I 
don't remember doing much marching 
either. Sometimes we have to teach our 
freshman how not to march." 
No one in his right mind has ever 
tried to argue that the PMB marches 
better than the Big-10 bands. "Such a 
thing as the Yale Precision Marching 
Band would be impossible in the 
Midwest," said Dr. Thurston. But 
comparing, say, the Navy or the Air 
Force band to Yale's is about like comparing a copy of National Geographic to 
Mad magazine. You just can't. 
While the Navy band will march onto the field in spotless uniforms, waving 
flags and twirling batons in configurations so neat they make the yard 
lines look crooked, the PMB will crowd 
raggedly into the end zone for warmup 
calisthenics- finger 
push-ups, toe 
bends, swimming strokes, and jumping 
jacks. If the Air Force does a 
tribute to Freedom, complete with 
standard bearers and a jet air show, 
then the PMB will do one in honor of 
Communism, 
with jugglers, uni-


cyclists, and a junk yard's worth of 
props. While the opposing band plays 
"Rocky" or "Star Wars," the PMB plays 
"Rock Lobster" or chants the "interception, 
contraception, 
stop-that-ball" 
cheer. 
Does 
this 
irreverent horseplay 
bother the other bands? Apparently 
not. After the Air Force game two 
years ago, several cadets in the band 
crossed over to the Yale side to congratulate the PMB for what others had 
considered 
a 
particularly 
scathing 
show on the armed forces. "Some of the 
brass might have been miffed," said 
Dr. Thurston, who, coincidentally, 
had directed the Air Force band before 
coming to Yale three years ago. "But 
they're usually a bunch of stuffed 
shirts. Maybe I'm just a kid at heart." 
The band's near brush with censorship 
in 1980 raised some important questions about the PMB: Why do Yale 
and only a handful of other schools in 
the country (Brown, University of 
Chicago, Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, and Stanford) 
have "unorthodox" bands? What does 
the presence of a phenomenon like the 
PMB say about the way Yale looks at 
football? And, who should the PMB 
ultimately try to entertain? The 
students? The alumni? The faculty? 
The networks? The local fans? 
"I have to play up to everybody," 
said Polinsky. "There's the administration, the athletic department, the 
alumni, even my mom and dad. 
There's constantly the problem of the 
recognition factor. I mean how many 
people over 40 are going to identify 
with 'Purple Haze?' We have to spread 
our humor out pretty thin." 
Detractors often seem to forget that 
the PMB differs greatly in its organization (and in its emphasis within the 
sports program) from the bands of the 
football powerhouses, which subordinate bands to the athletic department 
and award academic credit for band 
participation. "At no time did we expect the band to follow the role model 
of the Big-10," said Dean Henson. At 
some schools, playing tuba for the 
band is roughly equivalent in time 
commitment to playing linebacker for 
the team. At Yale, where the band enjoys complete independence from the 
athletic department, instrumentalists 
receive no credit and attend the games 
purely voluntarily. With a limited 
budget and little guidance from either 
the music school or the administration, 
the PMB will never march and play 
altogether precisely. 


Some members of the band take the 
PMB's 
independence 
from 
Yale 
athletics a step farther; they see the 
band as a balancing agent, a neutralizer, to offset the seriousness with 
which many people treat football. 
"People in the booth think the world 
moves when they take a shit," said 
Death, who, as the band's announcer, 
worked in the pressbox with ABC 
technicians, stats people, and football 
scouts. 
"We always tried to 
demonstrate to them how utterly 
stupid the game can be when they 
become that engrossed in yardage and 
first downs. ABC treated us like we 
were hired help." 
George Cohen, a clarinet player in 
the band for four years, said it best: 
"It's a way of being irreverent. We're 
putting football in perspective. People 
take the game too seriously, and they 
forget how strange it is that 20,000 
people come out every week to watch 
students beat heads together. The 
whole attitude toward the game at 
most colleges is totally wrong." 
So aside from cutting up and cracking dirty jokes, you might say the 
Precision Marching Band has a nobler 
purpose. Maybe you could say the 
PMB is just an institutional gadfly 
whose job is to make people laugh at all 
the momentous things that American 
football and football halftime shows 
have become. Its duty is to remind us 
that football is in fact a game. And if 
there is to be a gadfly in college football, why shouldn't it be the PMB? 
After all, the game was invented at 
Yale.
