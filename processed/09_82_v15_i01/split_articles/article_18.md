A weekly nuclear war 
Probably the most time-consuming, 
and certainly the most difficult part of 
putting on a PMB show is producing a 
script that works. Few people are 
aware of the innumerable headaches 
invested in each three-minute halftime 
text. Tempers often flare out of 
laughter during the weekly script-
writing sessions as 15 cantankerous 
comedians try to defend their own 
puns, jabs and jests. Bob "Death" 
Parker, last year's announcer, des-
cribed the meeting as "a weekly nuclear 
war." The scriptwriters can tread 
heavily on each other's emotions when 
they tread lightly on each other's jokes. 
"Sometimes people believe that if you 
don't think they are funny, then it 
means 
they're 
lepers," Death 
re-
marked. 

The writers quarrel· line by line, 
bargaining for jokes and puns as if they 
were Wall Street commodities. This 
line is too suggestive, that one too 
cliche; this joke is stale, that one too 
lengthy. Finally they arrive at a script 
they consider suitable. Barring a few 
minor "adjustments" by drum major 
David Polinsky or band director 
Richard Thurston, the script is com-
plete. The writers are confident that 
they've created something good, but it 
remains to be seen on Saturday how a 
crowd as large and as varied as the 
Yale Bowl (and maybe a TV audience) 
will receive it. Only when the laughter 
comes do they know they've succeeded. 
The following are excerpts from 
some of last year's most successful 
shows, selected from the PMB file: 
Good Afternoon Ladies and 
Gentlemen. We of the Yale Precision 
Marching Band would like to respond 
to a recent WICH radio sports show 
editorial. Dick Galliette was right. We 
are responsible for the Princeton Band 
not being allowed to go to West Point. 
It was our fault. We admit it. We also 
accept responsibility for the assassina-
tion of Anwar Sadat, President 
McKinley, and Julius Caesar. And we 
also killed thousands of Cambodians. 
And bombed London. And caused the 
' Black Plague. We're fl.lthy, perverted, 
and disgusting. And do you know what 
else? Next week, the entire Soviet 
Union will explode-engineered solely 
by . . . The Yale . . . Precision . . . 
Marching ... Band! 

.Yes, we've been told to clean up our 
act. In the past we used to form ftlthy, 
disgusting formations, like this one: 
Q 

Look at this formation. What would 
your analyst say about it? What would 
your mother say about what you're 
thinking? This is dirt! This is ftlth! 
This is unconscionable! But wait-
0 

This new formation is clean. This for-
mation is nice. This formation is only 
. . a cigar. 

First Russia went Communist and 
it was a big deal. Then China went 
Communist and all the people who 
weren't communists had to go to a tiny 
island and make T.V. sets. Then Cuba 
went Communist and Miami went 
Cuban. Now, in solidarity with the 
workers of the world, it's, The Yale ... 
Precision ... Marching ... Band. 

We take you now to Strategic Air 
Command in Omaha, Nebraska. 
"Hey, what's that button?" 
"I don't know, YOU push it!" 
"I'm not gonna push it, YOU push 
it!" 
"I'M not gonna push it!" 
"Hey, let's get Ronnie! He'll push 
anything!" 
"He pushed it! Hey Ronnie! You 
know what happened? You just 
launched ... The Yale ... Precision 
.. Marching ... Band!!" 

President Reagan has been in office 
for almost a year now, and already the 
opposition has broken into distinct fac-
tions. There's the "I'm in charge here!" 
Alexander Haig faction, and the "It 
was all just a joke anyway" David 
Stockman faction. Now that Reagan-
omics is making it more profitable to 
be wealthy, and Nancy Reagan's hair-
dresser makes more than most college 
presidents, conspicous consumption is 
back in vogue. 

Another example of conspicuous 
consumption is the James Watt •Let's 
use it all up RIGHT NOW" school of 
thought; or, as the song says, "This 
land was paved for you and me." Did 
you know that the Russians have a hole 
outside of Gorky which is five times 
bigger than anything we have in 
America? We're losing the race to rape 
the land! After all "guns don't kill 
people, TREES kill people!" 

Yes, today our subject is amazingly 
topical. We're talking about parents 
-your's, m1ne, everyone's ... Don't 
be embarrassed- we all have them. 
Some are more trouble than others. 
And what about Oedipus. A fine 
upstanding young man, killed his 
father, slept with his mother, poked his 
eyes out, and then had to wait 2500 
years for Freud to come along and tell 
him why he did it. Why ask Freud? We 
could have told him that if you do it 
you'll go blind. 

("I Only Have Eyes For You") 

Well, that last episode was a little 
gross. You want to hear about a nice, 
clean, historical American family? We 
take you know to a small, sleepy 
suburb, where we meet the Cleaver 
family, starring Hugh Beaumont, Bar-
bara Billingsley, 
To~y Dow, and 
special guest Lizzie Borden as the 
Beaver. 

In today's episode, Lizzy chops· 
Mommy and Daddy up into little tiny 
pieces ... "He!lo Mrs. 
Cleaver. 
Where is the Beaver?" "Oh, hi Eddie. 
Beaver took the deaver upstairs. He's 
giving his father 40 whacks. He's such 
a .cut-up. Would you like some milk 
and cookies, Eddie?" 

Russia isn't the only great Com-
munist country in the world. Over one 
quarter of the world's population is 
Chinese and one billion Chinese can't 
be Wong. The only trouble with Com-
munism in China is that half an hour 
after you revolt, you're hungry again. 

Since becoming a Communist coun-
try, it's been hard to get into China. 
We tried to penetrate the great wall, 
but if Ghengis couldn't do it, nobody 
Khan. 

Comrades-UNITE. For when the 
revolution comes around, all the Egg-
headed Leftist Intellectuals, or ELI, 
will Eliminate Leftover Imperialists, or 
ELI.
