savages and collectivism and 
the 
nonsense of egalitarian society. This is 
all hogwash, very often propogated by 
anthropologists who have never seen a 
primitive man. 

"I don't fight Marxist theory, you 
see, because it is like fascist theory or 
like Nazi theory, or even capitalistic 
theory. T hey are ethnocentric theories 
dreamt up by people with a limited 
knowledge of the universe and of 
mankind. In physics, you don't bother 
with wild models of the universe and of 
mankind. In the same way, a true an-
thropologist doesn't bother with such 
theories. Of course, we have Marxist, 
Fascist and Nazi anthropologists here 
and there. So social science is where 
physics and biology used to be in the 
sixteenth century. We do not yet 
distinguish between alchemists and 
chemists. You see it is all mixed up and 
usually it is the social alchemist who 
becomes the superstar while the 
chemist is hidden, not well understood 
and even looked down upon. The huge 
theories come forward and usually the 
huge theories are nonsense." 

The "religious influence" of Marxists 
in anthropology might be compared to 
the influence of the Creationists in 
biology; dogmas of the nineteenth cen-
tury still permeate the ranks of influen-
tial social anthropologists. Pospisil's 
quarrel is not with the "great thinkers" 
themselves, but with those who blindly 
parrot their works as gospel. He rejects 
the belief that by idle speculation one 
can uncover "laws" that govern social 
development. 

Pospisil's follow up studies were 
almost as revealing was his first trip. 
He witnessed a Neolithic people thrust 
through thousands of years of develop-
ment. Since his first trip, the policies of 
the Dutch colonial government 
towards New Guinea changed radical-
ly. The natives lost an important part 
of their culture when the government 
prohibited warfare between tribes. 
Modern medicine resulted in over-
population and over cultivation of the 
land. Twice the natives rose up to fight 
against forced integration. 

Pospisil maintains that the changes 
in Kapauku culture over the last three 
decades provide evidence to contradict 
Marx's theory of economic deter-
minism. Mcsrx's theory claims that the 
manner in which goods are produced 
will dictate the religion, laws and 
politics of a people. The evolution of 
Kapauku culture, 
Pospisil argues 
could not have been motivated 
primarily by economic factors. 
Neighboring villages often developed 
in different ways even though they 
shared a common economy. 

In one particularly striking example, 
Pospisil describes how a headman 
modified the incest taboo in his village. 
The motivation of the headman was 
simple- he fell in love with two of his 
second paternal cousins and decided to 
marry them. To lessen the effect of his 
crime, he made a law permitting such 
marriages. The new law was accepted 
and had far reaching effects, eventual-
ly altering even the physical structure 
of the village. The change could not 
have been economically determined, 
because the community shared its 
economy with surrounding villages 
which did not change their incest 
taboos. Pospisil argues that the law was 
accepted only because of the particular 
political and historical situation of the 
Botukebo community. 

Although Pospisil could not prevent 
the many upheavals in Kapauku 
culture, he did much to avert its total 
destruction. His books include com-
plete collections of their songs, myths, 
and legends. His works describe native 
dance, ritual and natural philosophy. 
His book Kapau.ku and their Law became 
the official source of native law used by 
the Dutch colonial government in 
judging disputes, but when IndoÂ· 
nesians took over, Pospisil was banned 
from New Guinea for opposing gov-
ernment policy toward the natives. 

Pospisil's last visit to the Kamu 
Valley was in the summer of 1979. He 
no longer sees anything odd about liv-
ing with Stone Age people. He still 
nolds strong ties with the Kapauku, 
counting among them several close 
friends and forty two adopted sons. As 
he looks forward to his next expedition 
into the rain forests of New Guinea, 
his reasons are perhaps as personal as 
they are scientific .
