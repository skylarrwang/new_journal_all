Add an A, 
end an era
Greg Myre 
After a century of football with over 
700 victories at collegiate 
~rt's 
highest level, Yale will enter a new era 
a week from tomorrow when the Bull-
dogs begin the 1982 season, their first 
outside the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association's (NCAA) highest 
division, 1-A. Yale and the rest of the 
Ivies were demoted to Division 1-AA 
last December. 
Since then no one in the Ivy League, 
from administrators to coaches to 
players, has come out in favor of being 
in Division 1-AA. Even as a rule 
adopted by the NCAA in December 
becomes accepted, it remains a sore 
spot, especially at Yale, where the 
Bulldogs have consistently beaten 1-A 
teams outside the Ivy League. Yet the 
demotion to 1-AA marks both the 
culmination of long-standing Ivy 
policies that have de-emphasized foot-
ball and the beginning of a new era 
that may cause those in charge of Ivy 
policy to re-evaluate their traditional 
positions. 
From a national perspective, the 
Ivies as a group do not belong in Divi-

sion 1-A. They have been a steadily 
declining football force for the last 
quarter century. Last season, the eight 
Ivy schools produced a combined 
record of six wins and 18 losses 
against teams outside of the Ivy 
League. Yale alone accounted for three 
of those victories. 
"The Ivy League is in another world 
all its own," said Penn State coach Joe 
Paterno at the NCAA meeting that 
dropped the Ivies from I-A. •rm in the 
real world," he added. 
Ivy administrators purposely 
created this situation which made their 
teams less than competitive. When the 
Ivy League was officially formed, it 
formulated guidelines concerning the 
scholastic indifference, and the win-at-
all-costs philosophy found in many 
big-time football programs. 
Ad-
ministrators effectively put limits on 
Ivy football programs by forbidding 
athletic scholarships, abolishing spring 
football practice, and not allowing Ivy 
schools to participate in post-season 
ball games. 
These policies, which have isolated 

the conference from the realities of big-
time football in an attempt to protect it 
from the abuses found in many major 
college programs, have had their effect 
on the teams' performances. The Ivies 
are consistently thumped by non-
league opponents, not because of a lack 
of talent, but because they are expected 
to compete with schools that give 
scholarships and have spring practice. 
Administrators have applied this 
policy primarily to football because it is 
the most visible sport. Crew teams can 
work out twice a day all year, but foot-
ball cannot have 20 days of spring 
practice because that would show an 
over-emphasis on football. 
"I can understand why football 
needs tighter controls because of its 
size and power relative to other 
sports," Coach Cozza said. "But I also 
think the Ivy football programs are un-
fairly discriminated against, especially 
with regards to the players." 
Cozza points out that 83 of Yale's 91 
football players were National Honor 
Society members in high school. "We 
have never. had problems with losing 
kids due to academics," he said, "The 
lvits need restrittibns ·on monetary 
policies, but we shouldn't restrict the 
kids from reaching their potential." 
Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford 
once wrote that "there 'is an oppressive 
self-consciousness that permeates Ivy 
League football." He added that the 
Ivy League's unwillingness to put itself 
on the line and admit it cares and try to 
be the best gives "'vy League football 
fans the same frustrations competitive-
ly that the Victorians had sexually." 
For almost 30 years, policies that de-
emphasized football allowed the Ivies 
to continue along their own u nique 
path, largely unaffected by the big 
business approach of most major 
schools, while still retaining recogni-
tion as a Division 1-A conference. 
But when 61 of the biggest football 
powers recently pushed for tougher 
qualifications of Division I -A member-
ship so that they could have a larger 
role in shaping TV contracts, the 
NCAA bowed to the pressure, and 
roughly 45 schools, including all the 
Ivies, were dropped ft:om Division 1-A 
to 1-AA. Yale met both of the new re-
quirements (a stadium with 30,000 
permanent seats, or an average of 
17,000 in paid attendance for at least 
one of the previous four seasons) but 
the Ivy schools decided to stick 
together. 
Yale was trapped in the middle 
because its football teams have proven 
they could survive in Division 1-A, yet 
it remained allied with its increasingly-
impotent Ivy bretheren. Last season 
Yale won all of its games with teams 
outside of the Ivy League, including an 
impressive victory over Navy, a highly 
regarded Division 1-A school. 
Yale coaches and administrators 
disagree over how Division 1-AA will 
affect the program. "Our football pro-
grams are going to suffer if we don't 
fight this," Coach Cozza said. "The ef-
fects may not be immediate, but even-
tually it could hurt us in terms of 
recruiting, scheduling, TV revenue, 
and prestige." Athletic Director Frank 
Ryan is less worried about the effects 
of demotion. "If I had my druthers f d 
be in 1-A, but we have accepted the 
change and it's business as usual," he 
To a certain degree, the difference 
between 1-A and 1-AA is semantic; 
Yale plays 10 football games a year and 
seven of those will always be against 
Ivy opponents. So it does not much 
matter if the Ivies are 1-A, 1-AA. or 
NFL. Yale will play virtually the same 
schedule. 
But the remaining three games can 
be quite significant because they allow 
Yale to prove its worth outside the 
Ivies. As a I-AA school, Yale may fmd 
it increasingly difficult to schedule a 
first-rate 1-A school. A school such as 
Navy was willing to play Yale because 
Yale was 1-A and it looked like both an 
attractive game and a fairly certain vic-
tory for Navy. It proved a bad risk, 
and now that Yale is 1-AA it will be a 
risk most 1-A schools are less likely to 
take since there is nothing to gain ex-
cept possible embarrassment when one 
battles a school in a supposedly inferior 
division. 
Had Yale not been able to schedule 
Navy_ last season its 9-1 record and 
many of the individual records would
