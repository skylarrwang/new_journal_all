**Title: Comment: Making room for the world**
**Author: Andy Court**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

They plop the world on my doorstep 
every morning. It lands with a thud, 
and someone's steps shuffie away. I 
take it out of the doorway, so people 
won't trip on it. I glance at the front 
page, but I don't have time to read. I'm 
late for class. I've got to get going. I've 
got so much to do. And the world has 
become like breakfast, really, 
something of a luxury I usually don't 
have time for, an excuse for pro-
crastination in those times that I do. 

Then I go to class where we talk 
about something called history. After 
the section, a friend expresses his pro-
found pleasure that he got in a remark 
even though he had not read the book. 
I'm left wondering: if you carry that at-
titude to its insidious extreme, what act 
was performed aside from a useless, 
shameless dance of egos around the 
table? 

I come home from ITIY classes, and 
my roommate is actually reading the 
newspaper. I fall asleep on the couch 
and someone wakes me up and invites 
me to a political round table. I decline 
this offer, just as I have avoided a 
friend's repeated invitations to attend a 
weekly discussion group in her room. 

Sometimes I do get caught in a 
"political" discussion, and it is most 
frustrating. Especially because I realize 
that most of the others know little more 
than I. Especially because I see how 
a~ept we all are at stretching what little 
bus we do possess into a discussion that 
often revolves around semanitcs in-
st~ad of reality. We are all equipped 
wnh the ability to make what we know 
seem like more than it is. We use this 
skill' o~ term papers written the night 
before, and discussion sections for 
which we are less than sufficiently 
prepared. 

Have we begun to believe what any 
suspecting TA would not-that we 
know more than we do simply because 
we have done the surface work and 
possess the fudging skills? And, even 
more distressing, have we gotten into 
the dangerous habit of shuffiing and 
embellishing what little we have ab-
sorbed, instead of coming to terms 
with material, making connections that 
apply to reality, formulating an in-
telligent position which would be possi-
ble to act on? 

I feel a strange mixture of shame 
and anger when I become involved in a 
discussion about something none of us 
seems to know the first thing about. It 
is not just the sheer irony and abstrac-
tion, our naive and idle wonder about 
some stumbled-upon topic like prison 
reform. It is the way the conversation 
becomes academic in the worst con-
notation of the term. Academic in the 
sense of a game that is played with 
ideas, in which all the participants are 
removed from the human implications 
of the subject. So that in the middle of 
talking about what we should do about 
putting people behind bars in horrid 
conditions, someone asks, "What's this 
in the soup?" 
"It's a kiwi." 
"A kiwi?" 

Yes, much of it is me, and yet I still 
believe that there is something wrong 
with the way many, perhaps most, of 
us perceive our relation to the "real 
world." We are in many ways compla-
cent and unaware and empty. Blame 
partly our youth, blame partly the for-
tunate circumstances of our birth in a 
land of relative prosperity. But also 
blame ourselves because we may have 
misinterpreted freedom to mean in-
vulnerability and have lapsed into 
laziness because nobody has slapped us 
in the face. 

Most of us are the privileged 
members of a so-far lucky generation, 
and our problem (in many ways a for-
tunate one) is that history isn't squeez-
ing us right now, and so we are not 
forced to come to terms with issues we 
know are there. 

If we were personally confronted, 
personally provoked, we would have 
no choice but to respond. But no one 
has dragged our parents off in the mid-
dle of the night, or told us that we will 
have to fight in a war tomorrow if our 
number comes up today. Some of us 
have lost financial aid, and some of us 
have had to fill out white pieces of 
paper reminding us that the govern-
ment 
considers 
us an available 
resource. T hat, however, is all. 

And so for us to be concerned, 
disturbed even, with the way things are 
going, we must lead with our minds 
and persuade our hearts to follow. The 
threat of nuclear war is a perfect exam-
ple of something you don't see, 
something that doesn't seem to affect 
our daily lives at all. Until it happens. 
Unless you make an intellectual 
leap, 
summoning some sense of 
historical possibility and thinking, 
"hey, this could happen and it's getting 
more and more probable all the time," 
then it might never really concern you. 
It might never concern you even 
though it is a much more important 
issue in your life than the change to a 
plus-minus grading system. The pluses 
and minuses, paper extensions and 
library policies are things you can see 
and feel their effects. Escalating arms 
and declining employment are less evi-
dent. 

As a student, I find myself in the 
unique position of having the time and 
luxury to think about things, yet the 
nature of my lifestyle, its hurried pace 
and self-absorption, seems to work 
against the very purpose of my stay 
here. 

No doubt some would argue that we 
are here for the seclusion and con-
templation; we will, after all, have the 
rest of our lives 
to read the 
newspapers, and gripe about taxes. 
But so much of a liberal education in-
volves developing appreciations, learn-
ing to care about things and carrying 
those concerns with you for the rest of 
your life. We do not live our lives in 
neatly-bundled d isciplines. We get it 
all at once- the psychological, 
biological, religious, and historical. To 
immerse ourselves in classical civiliza-
tion or organic chemistry while ignor-
ing what's going on around us is to 
sacrifice, for the sake of scholarship, a 
perspective on the present. Why not 
the world, now as well as later? 

Still it is easy to see how the urgent 
though unimportant i~sues easily take 
priority simply because they interfere 
with the daily operation of my life. If 
I've got a paper to write, that must 
come first because it's due tomorrow. 
Knowing about rent control, public 
education, or foreign affairs has no 
deadline, and so it's often not done. 
Thus arises that bland ivory tower feel-
ing I get after participating in some all-
too-uninformed and naive intellectual 
discussion. "Gee," I think, "I really 
should care more about this. Why 
don't I know more about it?" In-
evitably, it's because I've been so busy 
with my projects and my papers and 
my relationships to really worry about 
whether the president's policies may 
lead to the destruction of the earth. 
Not laziness, 
but extreme and 
misdirected diligence accounts for 
much of the problem. The tendency of 
so many of us is to immerse ourselves 
in our classes and activities and emerge 
from them successfully. I was so busy 
writing and night-editing at the Yale 
Daily News during my freshman year 
that I rarely found time to read that 
newspaper or any other. And so in the 
process of working hard to become a
