Old the murder really have 
anything to do with Yale? 
Dean of Yale College at the time, 
recalled any discussion in which the 
administration considered drafting a 
statement on the matter. 
Yale's responsibility? 
Chauncey and Taft also said they did 
not recall any effort to check back after 
the murder to see what had happened 
to Herrin and Garland while they were 
at Yale. This rai~es another question: 
What was Yale's responsibility for the 
events that preceded and possibly con-
tributed to the murder? Is it possible, 
as Gaylin writes, that Yale contributed 
"an inadvertent but significant share to 
the tragedy" ? 

Meyer and Gaylin both see Herrin 
as a minority student from a disadvan-
taged background who came to Yale 
where he was overwhelmed. "Richard 
was in culture shock from the be-
ginning," Gaylin writes. He was also 
academically intimidated, and admit-
ted in an interview with Meyer, "I gave 
up before I gave myself a chance." 
Sociallv, Meyer writes, Herrin had a 
sense of being "subtly ostracized." 
Thumbing through the pages of the 
Old Campus freshman directory, he 
"felt like an interloper coming to a for-
mal dinner with a counterfeit invita-
tion," Meyer writes. 

At the time Herrin came to Yale, 
there were 30 Chicanos attending the 
school. He did not attend PROP, a 
special program now held to help 
minority students adjust to Yale before 
school begins. 
"Should a university pursue an affir-
mative action program and insensitive-
ly assume that a boy from the barrio is 
no different from that young lad from 
Hotchkiss who brings his experience, 
his culture, his know-how, his friends, 
his manners, and his sense of self and 
place along with him to an environ-
ment that was designed for him by 
people like him?" Gaylin asks. 

Father R ichard 
Russell, 
senior 
Chaplain at More House, and a sup-
porter of Herrin, took issue with 
Gaylin. "I don't think Yale is as simple 
as the authors make it out to be. How 
do we define a minority? There are all 
kinds of people making all kinds of ad-
justments here." Russell said he disap-
proved of Gaylin's implication that it's 
wrong for an institution like Yale to 
take people who are going to be over-
whelmed. 

Â·The only tangible sign of Herrin's 
problems was his poor academic 
' record. He failed three courses in his 
first two years, and graduated only 
after taking a course and writing his 
senior paper over the summer. Herrin 
barely squeaked by, but Chauncey and 
Taft said they didn't know of any at-
tempt on the administration's part after 
the murder to see if Herrin's residential 
college dean or faculty advisor had sat 
him down and tried to find out what 
was wrong. 

Again, Gaylin feels Yale could have 
done more: "Makeup examinations, 
incompletes, special exceptions, 
pushing through, and finally gradua-
tion despite incomplete work are not 
appropriate substitutes for awareness, 
supervision, 
guidance, 
and even 
discipline. He needed an institutional 
mother. Where is alma mater these 
days?" 

Chauncey said that failures, TI's, 
and graduation contingent upon sum-
mer work are not at all unique at Yale, 
and are not necessarily a sign of deep 
emotional troubles. He adds that there 
is not necessarily any connection be-
tween Herrin's poor academic work 
and the forces that moved him to 
murder. 

Yale may not play the role of an "in-
stitutional mother" but it does provide 
a support system of people students 
can 
go 
to 
for help- freshman 
counselors, residential college deans,


faculty 
advisors, 
chaplains, and 
therapists at University Health Ser-
vices. There are no statistics on the 
number of lives saved because the sup-
port system is working, University 
Chaplain John Vannorsdall said. It is 
an unseen and unsung network depen-
dent not only on university workers 
but also on the troubled students 
themselves and friends who may guide 
them to someone who can help. 

If Richard Herrin did not hook up 
with people who could help him it is in-
deed largely his fault. In an interview 
with Meyer, he said he was not sure 
what kept him from seeking help but 
there were certain feelings he was 
afraid to reveal to anyone, even Bon-
nie Garland. 

In Herrin's case, Vannorsdall said, 
"' don't know anybody who had an ink-
ling. How can you provide a support 
structure when there aren't any clues?" 

Soul ... archlng
If the Yale murder had occurred on the 
Yale campus during the school year, it 
would perhaps have been cause for 
more soul-searching. Last year when 
John Angel, a freshman in Davenport 
College, died on November 20 after 
taking a combination of barbituates 
and alcohol, the Council of Masters 
took a serious look at Yale's alcohol 
policy. But during and after the trial of 
Herrin, there was little discussion of 
the matter on campus, according to 
Fenno Heath. 

Although Yale may have had very 
little to do with the killing of Bonnie 
Garland, it could have at least taken 
the occasion to address issues this com-
munity needs to address over and over 
again. What is Yale's responsibility 
towards minority students? What is the 
proper balance between supervision 
and restriction? What ultimately deter-
mines the success or failure of support 
systems? 

Without accepting blame or point-
ing fingers, the University community 
could perhaps have taken time to con-
sider itself. That it did not, that some 
denied it had anything to do with Yale 
at all, is the small shame of this enor-
mous tragedy.
