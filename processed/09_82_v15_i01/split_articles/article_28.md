"Mysticism In the widest sense belongs to the core of all religious faith, whether communal or private."  Introductory question, Dupre has written a book neither didactic nor dogmatic, one that succeeds in encouraging the reader to join him in the search for the element of mysticism in Christian faith.

Henri Nouwen, Dupre's friend and former Yale colleague who now lives in the Trappist monastery in Genesee, New York, notes in the forward that Dupre may have seemed out of place at the Abbey: "I kept hearing Louis' inspired voice in this for-him-so-unusual milieu, and I kept seeing eager faces listening to this, for-them-so-unusual visitor." Nevertheless, Dupre's sensitivity to the Trappist way of life is seen in the pages of The Deeper Life. He is addressing a group of men who have dedicated their lives to a spiritual journey to bring them closer to God. Dupre is conversational as he puts forward how mysticism can be part of the spiritual journey for monks and readers alike.

Eastern religions are considered "mystical" because of their emphasis on meditation and personal search for the spiritual union with God. Christianity's history and heritage as seen in its Sunday morning splendor and omnipresent edifices is conceived quite differently in contemporary society, but Dupre contends that Christianity should not be excluded from being considered mystical.

He writes, "Mysticism in the widest sense, understood as some passively infused experience, belongs to the core of all religious faith, whether communal or private."

For Dupre, the mystical search for the spirtual life is found in turning inward so that the self will exist alone with God separate from the structure of existence. Dupre searches for the place "where God and soul touch, the divine place where God resides, the center of my created being which remains permanently united with God's creative act." Those familiar with Dupre's earlier work, Transcendent Selfhood, may find The Deeper Life a personal meditation on the ideas he set forth previously.

Because it deals with intimate feelings and elusive emotions, mysticism is more easily experienced than explained. Keeping this problem in mind, Dupre reviews how the classical Christian mystical writers have expressed mysticism within their spiritual life. He enlists the help of St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. John of the Cross. Primarily, though, Dupre follows the thinking of the 14th century German Dominican Meister Eckhart. For Eckhart, "God means absolute poverty." For Dupre, this poverty is "the goal of the mystical journey."

Unfortunately, such attempts to describe the experience of Christian mysticism seem confusing at times. The "poverty of God" may make sense to a Cistercian monk who has spent years in silence and meditation searching for aloneness with God. But the person looking for an inroad to spiritual mysticism whose experience is mostly within the confines of Sunday morning liturgies may be at a loss with The Deeper Life. Dupre states that the Christian mystic must purge the soul, as St. John the Cross did, through the suffering and failure of Christ. "The mystic is ready for the passive purgation," Dupre states, "because he or she has long learned to accept all suffering as a God given chance to be purified." This may be so, but it is clearly something one must experience. The Deeper Life is not a how-to or do-it-yourself Christian mysticism book. Like the Cistercian monks who originally heard the material, the reader should have some background in or eagerness for mysticism. In that sense, the book is not introductory enough. It will help those who have already started their mystical journey more than those who are trying to begin.


To the book's benefit, Dupre does an excellent job at showing the importance and rewards of pursuing mysticism. The ultimate pursuit of such a journey is the union of God and soul. Quoting St. Teresa, Dupre describes the union as a marriage of sorts where the human soul and God become "like two who cannot be separated from one another." The soul, through this union, knows the nature and purpose of God.


Deeper Life will appeal to Christian and non-Christian alike. Dupre has shown the peculiarities of Christian mysticism well, but he also acknowledges the validity of other mystical approaches to some ultimate, or the ultimate, truth. He demonstrates how Christianity harmonizes with the mystical approaches of other religions.


The importance of mysticism, Christian or otherwise, is paramount for Dupre. As he sees it, culture and secular society have created the need for understanding our spiritual lives through mysticism. "The need out of which I speak is not merely personal," Dupre writes. "It is the need of an entire age that has replaced transcendence by self-transcending. We may call the prevailing climate atheistic, not because the faith has disappeared in our time, but because the question whether we believe in God or not, retains little or no practical bearing upon our lives."
