**Title: Perils of the middle path**
**Author: John Russo and Kathryn Hemker**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

It came out of the blue, sandwiched between 
the Whiffenpoofs and Smoker John Glenn. 
John A. Russo, a graduating senior in 
Silliman and a cofounder of the Campaign 
Against Militarism and the Draft, stood up 
before 3,000 of his classmates and their 
relatives packed into Woolsey Hall, and 
spoke his mind. Parts of the Class Day 
speech were intended as a direct rebuttal to 
President A. Bartlett Giamatti's Bac-
calaureate Address, "In the Middle 
Distance," delivered that morning from the 
same rostrum. In the address, Giamatti had 
said, "In urging you beyond ideology . . . I 
offer the view of one person, one who is clearly 
middle-aged, middle-class, middle of the 
road; a view of one not given to extremes but 
to the middle." 

"I was concerned about why people are going corporate," Russo told The New Journal. "I was concerned that our own president 
had come out and told us to be a relativist, to 
compromise our convictions." 

The following is the full text of that 
speech, co-written by Kathryn Hemker, and 
delivered May 23. 

Parents, faculty, and honored guests: I 
hope that you will excuse me if I take 
this opportunity to speak directly to 
my classmates. Fellow graduates, all 
about us, our choices and our liberties 
are in danger. Let me give you a few 
examples. 

Book banning, a narrow-minded 
practice that discourages thought, is 
enjoying a revival in our schools. 
Thought vigilantes seek to censor any 
books that do not conform to their 
catechism of correct and patriotic 
views. These individuals would go so 
far as to shield their children, and the 
children of others, from knowledge of 
our country's past misdeeds, including 
slavery. In a misguided attempt to 
preserve children's innocence, book 
banners would condemn future generations to ignorance, and possibly the 
repetition of the same atrocities. 

Elsewhere, there are other signs of 
restriction. In 1973 the Supreme Court 
declared that, with respect to abortion, 
decisions regarding reproductive rights 
were a private matter between doctor 
and patient. But current legislation in 
Congress attempts to intervene in this 
private relationship by defining so-
called "moral" boundaries. 

In a reasonably democratic system, 
such as ours, these problems are easily 
seen, 
if not easily solved. 
Our 
economic system, on the other hand, 
limits our freedoms in ways which are 
far more obscure and insidious. 

Probably the most salient example 
for this graduating class is the state of 
the job market. More of us lined up at 
Career Advisory seeking corporate interviews this year than ever before. 
Because of this, critics have accused us 
of being selfish and without ideals. But 
we were offered fewer choices than 
previous graduates. 

Traditionally, jobs such as teaching, 
social work, and legal aid have been 
considered idealistic. Now, with spending 
cuts in educational loans, social 
programs, and legal assistance for the 
poor, it has become virtually impossible 
to pursue these careers. 

And have we lost our idealism? No, 
what we have lost is the opportunity to 
enter the professions that have attracted idealistic people in the past. 
The so-called "free market" has produced jobs only in the business sector. 
This is the reflection of an economic 
system that places greater emphasis on 
the evils of ring around the collar than 
on the evils of substandard housing. 

Our mistake is in placing the responsibility for social justice on a small 
number of professionals, rather than 
on all citizens. In these days when our 
freedoms are slipping away we must 
realize that social action is not an option: it's a responsibility. 

We have been subtly told-even
