About this issue 
Welcome back from what was prob-
ably a pretty busy summer. It was 
pretty busy for most of us, too. 
From distant points like New York, 
Edmonton, Berkeley, Memphis, and 
New Haven, reporters and editors 
worked long-distance to put this issue 
together. While writing for his 
hometown magazine, newly-elected 
Associate Editor W. Hampton Sides 
put the polishing touc;hes on a piece 
he believes "is destined to rock the il-
literate world." Hampton found the 
Precision Marching Band's leader 
David Polinsky to be an adroit politi-
cian who has tempered the band's 
traditionally-raunchy sense of humor 
with a respect for the tastes of more 
conservative alumni, local football 
fans, and administration officials. 
Coming up with a cover shot for 
the Marching Band story proved 
something of a chore. Though we 
had a perfect picture of Polinsky with 
his arms spread out,in ecstatic ex-
postulation, we couldn't get his arms 
to fit within the confines of the cover. 
Enter Matt Bartholomew, our new 
designer, and Jeff Strong, our new 
photography editor, who managed to 
summon Polinsky from his chicken 
farm in rural Connecticut. At 8:30 
on a Monday morning, while traffic 
flowed below, Bartholomew and 
Strong found themselves on the roof 
of the Taft Apartments trying to 
re-create his historic pose. 
Never one known for understate-
ment, Polinsky was precariously 
teetering on the Taft's edge, Bar-
tholomew reports. "If he went over 
the ledge, we were all set," he said. 
"Jeff was going to run up and take 
pictures of him going down. It would 
have been Pulitzer Prize material, I 
think." 
In this issue, we also introduce a 
new section called NewsJournal (Get 
it?). This will allow us to follow up 
stories we covered in previous issues, 
and develop shorter stories we would 
previously have had to pass up. This 
month, Morris Panner and Hampton 
Sides put the section together. 
Associate Editor Geoff Hayward 
recounts the story of Leopold 
Pospisil's journey into the rain forests 
of New Guinea where he discovered 
that the Kapauku Papauans didn't 
follow Marx's prescription for 
primitive societies. Hayward has 
been working for the past nine 
months on our research stories, at-
tempting to make oftentimes 
technical ideas interesting and ac-
cessible. His background in physics 
has sometimes helped. He spent this 
summer working in a Physics lab in 
Edmonton, Canada, and pro-
crastinating on a make-up exam he 
had to confront last week. 
You may notice more adver-
tisements in the magazine this year. 
Barbara Burrell, our new Business 
Manager, has been the person co-
ordinating our advertising strategy. 
We have been trying for some time to 
work out a simple yet effective 
method for account management, 
and Burrell has been extremely in-
volved in this process. She is a Dallas, 
Texas, native who did financial public 
relations wor.k in New York this sum-
mer for Kekst and Co. 
We are constantly looking for new 
people to work on the magazine. On 
Wednesday September 15 we will be 
holding an organizational meeting. 
Hope to see you there. 
Enjoy the issue.
