The Falwell fire 
The Reverend Jerry Falwell, who will 
speak 
before 
the Political Union 
November 11, has been waiting almost 
a year now for a chance to come to 
Yale and defend his much-maligned 
Moral Majority. 

It was this time last fall when Presi-
dent A. Bartlett Giamatti released his 
fulminous Freshman Address on the 
Moral Majority and sent waves of con-
troversy ringing· from the gothic towers 
in New Haven to the church-steepled 
hills of southern Virginia. In the ad-
dress, which was printed in its entirety 
in the New York Times and the 
Washington Post, Giamatti accused the 
Moral Majority of "licensing a new 
meanness of spirit in our land, a 
resurgent bigotry that manifests itself 
in racist and discriminatory postures." 

Calling the leaders of the fundamen-
talist organization "peddlers of coer-
cion," Giamatti wrote, "The Moral 
Majority would displace law with 
polyester mysticism and would 
presume to impose a final, complete, 
arbitrary contour on society, and the 
behavior of individuals." 

Needless to say, Falwell and his 
associates weren't too happy about that 
speech. In September the Political 
Union tried to arrange a sort of 
Fugard's successes 
DeYid Ott~ntTM ..... Joumel 
Afrikaner playwright Athol Fugard won a 
Tony Nomiruuion as Best Director last year. 
"monkey trial" debate between Falwell 
and Giamatti ("The Debate That 
Wasn't,"TNJ January 30). The Moral 
Majority in Lynchburg quickly ac-
cepted the invitation, but Giamatti, 
who had maintained a conspicuously 
low profile since the release of the ad-
dress, flatly declined. "I think Giamatti 
is a chicken," responded Cal Thomas, 
Vice President and chief spokesman 
for Moral Majority, Inc., "and I would 
be happy to call that to his face. The 
low class of his remarks leaves me 
nothing to fear from a personal and 
even intellectual confrontation with 
him, and I would renew the challenge. 
I think we could present Dr. Falwell at 
Yale- and he's interested in going- if 
Giamatti would simply stop hiding 
behind the intellectual equivalent of his 
mother's skirts, and come out and fight 
like a man." 

Nelson Keener, who handles press 
relations for the Rev. Falwell, said that 
Falwell and possibly Cal Thomas will 
speak at Yale about the Moral Majori-
ty itself, and then will entertain ques-
tions. "The Political Union has been 
after us for two years. The debate plan 
didn't work out, so this is the next best 
thing."

**Title: Fugard's Successes**
**Author: David Ottenberg**

For most playwrights, a Tony Award 
means extra fan mail, but if you hap-
pen to be Athol Fugard, the controver-
sial South African dramatist, critical 
recognition may lead the Government 
to open up your mail. 

Since Heinrich von Staden inter-
viewed him for TN] in February, 
Fugard has done exceptionally well. 
His latest play, Master Harold . . . and 
the Boys, was one of five Tony Award 
nominees this spring, and it lost out 
only to the popular Nicholas Nickleby. 
Master Harold also won the Outer 
Critics' Circle Award for drama. Zakes 
Mokae, handpicked by Fugard in 
South Africa to play the lead, won the 
Tony Award for Best Actor, and 
Fugard himself was nominated for Best 
Director. Apart from critical praise, 
the play has enjoyed an 85 percent 
capacity all summer on ·Broadway, an 
almost unprecedented success for a 
straight play. 

But despite Fugard's public appeal 
in America, the South African govern-
ment rarely accords him a warm wei-
. come. "I have a feeling they may be 
opening up his mail again," said Roz 
Heinz, Press Relations Director for the 
Yale Rep, when she discovered that a 
gift from New Haven that had been 
sent to celebrate his Tony nomination 
had taken two months to reach him in 
South Africa. 

Fugard has not yet attempted to pro-
duce Master Harold 
in his native 
country. He considers the play a par-
ticularly sensitive work to stage there, 
and it is the first play in his 24-year 
career which has premiered outside of 
the apartheid nation. 

The work 
revolves around an episode from the 
lives of two black men (Willie and 
Sam) and a 17-year-old white boy 
(Hally, later Master Harold). "There 
are elements in Master Harold . . . and 
the Boys that might have run into cen-

sorship problems," Fugard said in his 
February interview. 

The fact that Fugard has developed 
close ties with Yale and Drama School 
Dean Lloyd Richards has led many 
within the dramatic community here to 
believe that the Afrikaner will return to 
Yale this year to work as a playwright-
in-residence for the Rep and direct 
another play. But Heinz says those 
rumours are unfounded. "As much as 
we would treasure having him here at 
the Rep, the greater advantage in the 
long run would be for him to stay in 
South Africa, where his heart and 
work are, to write another play." 

Back in South Africa, Fugard is now 
directing his daughter in one of his 
earlier works, People Are Living There. 
He is also working on his 
autobiography and beginning a new 
play. 



**Title: Trials of a draft resister**
**Page number(s): 11**

I tlaink tJuu we should be men first, and sub-
j«ts afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate 
a respect for the law, so much as for the right. 
-Henry David Thoreau, 1849. 

Thoreau's "Essay on Civil 
Dis-
obedience" has become something of a 
bible for 21-year-old David Wayte, a 
former Yale student who goes on trial 
for draft resistance on the 28th of this 
month. Wayte is one of five men in the 
United States who have been indicted 
by the Federal Government for failing 
to register for the draft. A Pasadena 
resident who would now be a senior in 
Trumbull had he not dropped out two 
years ago to devote himself to the pro-
test against draft registration, Wayte 
has decided to follow his conscience 
into the courts, even if it means going 
to jail. 

•1 obviously don't want to go to 
prison," Wayte told The New Journal in 
a phone interview. "God knows I'm 
frightened about it, but I am prepared 
to go." 

Wayte is very certain about his 
motives for disobedience. "I don't want 
to take eve~ the first step toward war," 
he explained. "I'm protesting the spirit 
?f militarism that is growing in Amer-
Ica. I don't consider it a radical thing to 
say that I want to control my own life. 
I'm not a piece of the government's 
property to be used in Lebanon or El 
hours after he appeared on ABC's 
Salvador or wherever else it decides to 
Nightline the night following the ver-
send me. I think we should always look 
diet. "Not just with the outcome, which 
for alternatives to war, not steps 
I had expected all along, but mostly 
toward war, especially when we know 
with the fact that Ben wasn't allowed to 
that we are on the verge of global 
state his motives for not signing. They 
suicide at all times." 

Wayte, who has been one of the 
most vocal opponents of registration, 
has been a conspicuous violator from 
the very beginning. When the Carter 
Administration first stumbled upon 
draft registration renewal in 1979 as a 
possible way to show American disap-
proval of the Soviet invasion of most visible violators, the ones who 
Afghanistan, Wayte wrote a letter 
have spoken out, and then it has ex-
directly to President Carter explaining 
pedi ted our trials. The idea is to show 
why he would never support the Selec-
the others what could happen to them." 

Sasway and Wayte do not qualify as 
~nscientious objectors in the tradi-
tional sense, since neither has cited a 
particular religious aft-.liation or ethnic 
heritage as a rationale for non-com-
pliance. For most of today's draft 
resisters, it is strictly a matter of per-
sonal conscience. But Sasway and 
Wayte do have one remaining tnimp-
card: There are at least 675,000 men in 
the country who for various reasons 
have not signed up either. Proceedings 
on that large a scale would obviously 
present immense legal problems for the 
Justice Department. Supposing that 
the government could indict and con-
viet every one, which it could not, the 
resulting mass of violators would fill 
the cu~nt national prison system 20 
times over. 

"This is the greatest law enforcement 
problem since prohibition," said 
Wayte. "It has become a mass move-
ment, really. It would be impossible 
for the government to imprison all of 
us. My only hope is that by refusing to 
back down, we can raise public con-
sciousness and maybe get the law 
changed."
