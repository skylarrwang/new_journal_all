No longer will tM Band drop trou on national t~lroision, as it did in the Brown game 
(1977). 

It was the spring of 1981 and the Preci-
sion Marching Band was in a fix. It 
had been a bad year for the band, a 
"nadir" as President Giamatti had 
called it. 

Disgruntled alumni, 
in 
unprecedented numbers, had written 
angry letters to the administration and 
to the athletic department that year, 
accusing the PMB of everything from 
"cheap sadism" to "unfunny vulgarity." 

The band's ofT-key halftime perfor-
mances had infuriated New Haven 
residents, Connecticut football fans, 
and 
television 
networks alike. 
A 
Westport woman, for example, had 
described one show she'd seen as •the 
most 
vulgar, 
tasteless, 
sickening 
display of filth that any of us have ever 
seen." She was probably referring to a 
show that had featured Handsome 
Dan, the mascot bulldog, lying in fetal 
position inside what appeared to be the 
uterus of a pregnant woman formation 
while the band solemnly played Bolero. 

Such performances had virtually 
become the rule rathe"r than the glaring 
exception. Flashy articles and flaming 
letters about the band's shenanigans 
were appearing in local and regional 
papers, even The New York Tzmes.
