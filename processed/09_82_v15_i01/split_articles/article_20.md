"They said I was covering 
up for our Immortality." 
The Kapauku Papauans of New Guinea prepan'ng for a pig feast celebration. 
ceedingly complex, much more so than 
any contemporary European lan-
guage. But having at that time six 
other languages already under his belt, 
Pospisil picked up the language fairly 
quickly. After five months he had got-
ten to the point where he could under-
stand even when the Kapauku talked 
amongst themselves. 

Having learned the basics of the 
language, 
he discovered that the 
natives were more frightened of his 
clothing than of him. Once he stripped 
to his shorts, and they saw that he had 
limbs like theirs, they began to accept 
him more easily. But now, his clearly 
visible white skin supported other 
misconceptions. 

"I found out," he said, "that they 
regarded me as immortal. 'White man 
is immortal, he doesn't die.' Now, 
there was a big argument. I said we did 
die and they didn't believe me. Then I 
found out the reason they "scientifical-
ly" thought we didn't die was because 
of our light skin. The only light-
skinned animals they had in their en-
vironment were small crayfish. The 
crayfish sheds its shell and becomes 
soft and pink. The shell then hardens 
and is shed again periodically. They 
believe that in this way the crayfish re-
juvenates itself; 
the soft 
pinkish 
shellfish are like the 
babies of 
Kapauku. So, they believed that the 
crayfish was the only ammal around 
that was immortal because of this cycl-
ing. And they claimed the same was 
true of me. I said, 'This is nonsense. 
We die, we get killed by accidents or by 
force, in wars, or we die of old age and 
disease like you do.' No, they wouldn't 
believe me. They said I was covering 
up for our immortality. 

"Then what happens to me? I tan, so 
I started to get brown. They say, 'Aha! 
You see-you lied to us. Now you are 
getting brown like the crayfish.' In-
deed, I went to New Guinea straight 
from New Haven, and as always hap-
pens to me when I first go in the sun 
and overdo it, I burned and I peeled. 
So, first exposure to the sun, I got red 
then I got brown, and they say, 'Aha, 
now you will peel,' and, indeed, I did. 
So that was a cinch; I was lying to 
them and we were immortal, and I was 
covering up for our immortality." 

Normally, the Kapauku are a prac-
tical people, not interested m such 
complicated reasonings. But, a few of 
the oldest men who spend time con-
templating the nature of the universe 
offered Pospisil their explanation of 
nature. 

The earth is a flat block of soil and 
stone infinitely deep. The sun is a ball 
of fire, and the moon is a cool ball giv-
ing off light like that of fire flies. The 
sun and moon range across a solid in-
verted bowl. In day time, the sun 
travels from east to west just under-
neath the surface of the bowl. At night, 
the sun travels back over the bowl. The 
sun's light shines through a number of 
perforations in the bowl which we call 
"stars." 

The Kapauku's ingenious natural 
philosophy is accompanied by perhaps 
the most primitive technology in the 
world today. They are without pottery, 
painting or written language. They 
remember the past with the aid of 
knotted strings. Otherwise, their 
technology is limited to bow making 
and net weaving. They can calculate to 
the hundreds of thousands but make 
use of this ability only in market place 
transactions. 

Nonetheless, 
Pospisil 
found occasion to be thankful for the 
scientific accomplishments of his hosts. 

"Once I scratched my lower right leg 
and developed what you call a tropical 
ulcer," he said "The same day I had 
huge swelling and got down with a bad 
fever from the terrific infection in my 
leg. So I wanted to operate on myself路 
with a Gillette blade. The natives saw 
that I wanted to cut through my leg 
and screamed 'For heavens sake, you 
would cut your vein.' They asked me, 
'Do you know how to cut a leg?' I said 
no. 'Well,' they said, 'you are a fool to

cut yourself, we'll get you an expert- a 
doctor.' So they got him, and he came 
with two helpers, two husky, very 
muscular fellows. One sat down and 
held me from behind, incapacitating 
my arms; the other sat on my thighs 
and fixed my legs to the ground. Then 
the doctor started to operate with stone 
flint chips which he chipped in front of 
me. When I asked him, 'Why do you 
chip a new knife, you certainly have 
old chips?' He said, 'The old chips are 
bad because there is an evil spirit on 
them.' Well, just clever people, and I 
was more confident after he told me 
that. 

"He started to operate. Now I was 
very apprehensive about the opera路 
tion, that is, I expected terrific pain. 
The fantastic thing was how clever 
they were at inflicting the least pain 
without any anesthetic. 
He cuts 
through making a short instantaneous 
cut and then withdraws. It was like 
pricking with a needle, I was jerking, 
but before I could scream, the knife 
was withdrawn. 

"So in this way he slowly worked 
himself right to the bone. Then he stuf路 
fed the thing with crushed leaves from 
a plant, and then sealed it. He cured 
me; in about ten days and I was walk-
ing. Other people, friends of mine with 
tropical ulcers, had their legs i11 a 
bucket for half a year incapacitated 
with this." 

When Pospisil first went to New 
Guinea, anthropology was still a study 
o f dichotomies: modern versus 
primitives, civilized versus barbaric, 
logical versus prelogical. The theories 
of political thinkers such as Marx and 
Durkheim still dominated the field. 

The Marxist dialectic of history 
presents 
neolithic society as 
a 
leaderless, 
prim1t1ve communism , 
without private property or division of 
labor. While Pospisil did not accept en路 
tirely the Marxist portrait of Stone Age 
culture, he did expect to find the 
natives' very 
primitive 
technology 
would accompany a very primitive 
economy. 

One of the biggest surprises of his 
research was the discovery that the 
Kapauku had a 
highly advanced 
market economy. Contrary to Marxist 
prediction, he uncovered a highly in-
dividualistic wealth-oriented society 
with true money and rigid contractual 
obligations. Natives gain prestige and 
political power not through bravery in 
combat or skill in religious ceremonies, 
but almost entirely through the ac-
quisition of wealth. 

Money is the medium of almost all 
contractual obligations. A young man 
pays heavily for his bride. The only 
limitations to the number of brides he 
may take is the number he can afford. 
If his brother dies, he must pay all 
those who mourn over the grave. Since 
the death caused the mourners grief, 
they have a right to demand-compen-
sation. Everything from parcels of 
land, to wild pigs, to the paths of the 
forest are owned by individuals. In 
fact, 
Pospisil concludes, 
Kapauku 
society is far more individualistic than 
contemporary American society. If a 
native of the Kamu Valley visited New 
Haven, suggests Pospisil, "he would 
call us dirty socialists." 

Rigid divisions of labor dictate dif-
ferent chores depending on the age and 
sex of the worker. Strict taboos prevent 
women from entering men's quarters, 
eating food reserved for males, or 
engaging in male rituals. Should a 
woman try to break these taboos, the 
natives believe she will cause the death 
of her husband. And if the woman's 
husband dies under such cir-
cumstances, she may be held legally 
responsible and could suffer execution 
as a result. 

Beyond the strict age/sex labor divi-
sions there is room for specialization. 
Pospisil saw the equivalents of profes-
sional lawyers, dentists, doctors, mer-
chants and 
even 
professional 
embezzlers. Ail this is a far cry from 
the Marxist vision of collective and 
egalitarian society. 

"I said if I had to put a label to it, I 
would call it 'primitive capitalism,' and 
that of course enraged them all," 
Pospisil said. "Not because the state-
ment was unjustified, but because it 
fights their theories, their convictions. 
Marxism is actually a religion to these 
anthropologists -let's be clear about 
that. It's just not science what they're 
practicing, it's just the antithesis of 
science .... What I found was just 
the opposite of what you read about
