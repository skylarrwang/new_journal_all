have been viewed quite skeptically by 
outsiders who could claim such 
achievements were accomplished 
against weak Ivy opponents. One vic-
tory over a team such as Navy gives 
Yale's season legitimacy and prestige 
that it would not have gained had it 
played a lesser known I-AA school. 


And in college sports "prestige" 
translates into two important factors: 
the ability to raise money and recruit 
first-rate players. 

Yale collected roughly half a million 
dollars from television contracts last 
year. A television appearance is worth 
between $200,000 and $300,000. Last 
season, the prestige of Yale's program 
was such that ABC televised two of 
Yale's games (Navy and Dartmouth). 

Because Yale's entire athletic budget 
(for 33 varsity sports) is a little over $4 
million, the money made from TV ap-
pearances can help to balance the 
athletic budget. 

While the Ivies have never relied on 
TV revenue to support themselves, 
television also provides exposure, 
which is an immeasurable aid in 
recruiting. And recruiting is the area 
that may by most affected by demotion 
to 1-AA. 

Over the years, Yale has done better 
than its Ivy opponents because of its 
ability to recruit outstanding players. 
Yale has successfully sold bright and 
talented high school athletes on the 
benefits of a Yale education and the 
chance to play football at the Division 
1-A level, even if this means foregoing 
a 
scholarship that is 
available 
elsewhere. Yale will still be able to 
recruit a sufficient number of quality 
players, but attracting the outstanding 
prospects will become increasingly dif-
ficult. For the extremely talented high 
school player, the prospect of paying 
one's way to play at a 1-AA school pales 
compared to the chance to play at a 
Division 1-A school for free.
