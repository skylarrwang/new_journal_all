**Title: Aftermath of a Yale murder**

"I like Richard," said one of the prison 
officials at the Eastern Correctional 
Facility in Napanoch, New York. 

Then a guard buzzed the double-
locking doors, and through the formica 
visiting room, down a door to the 
right, 
Richard Herrin, 
the Yale 
murderer, appeared. 

Seeing the man without seeing or 
feeling the harm that he has caused, it 
was difficult not to· agree with the 
prison official. His long black hair 
pinned · back behind his head, his 
neatly-groomed mustache coming 
down to the corners of his lip, Herrin 
appeared healthy, fit, and reflective. 

He refused to talk on the record about 
the murder or about his Yale ex-
periences until he had time to think 
about some of the specific questions 
posed. He seemed so "together"-so 
aware, sincere, articulate, assertive in 
a quiet way- that it forced one to 
weigh present positive impressions 
against the volumes of collected 
knowledge about the case, and the one 
indelible consequence of his act. 

It has been almost a year since Her-
rin, Yale '75, the killer of his girlfriend, 
Bonnie Garland, granted interviews to 
two authors writing books about his 
case. Those books- The Yale Murder by 
Peter Meyer, and The Killing of Bonnie 
Garland by Willard Gaylin, M.D.-
both criticize Yale for the way it 
responded to the 1977 murder, and 
suggest the Yale environment might 
have contributed to the troubles that 
caused Herrin to kill. 

"Yale acted as though someone had 
inadvertently dumped 
a 
load of 
manure on its front lawn," Gaylin 
writes. "It was embarrassing, an an-
noying inconvenience, and Yale was 
particularly offended by the impor-
tunity of the neighbors in complaining 
of the stench. 'After all, it wasn't Yale's 
fault' was a constant refrain. Yale's of-
ficial attitude remains constant to this

day. While the mess was on their 
doorstep, it was not of their doing." 

Said Meyer in an interview this 
summer: "The attitude among the Yale 
administrators that I talked with, as 
evidenced by the very fact they didn't 
want me to use their names, is that 
they wpuld just as soon have this thing 
go away." He believes there was "a 
great deal of misjudgment and lack of 
awareness on the Yale administration's 
part." 

But did the murder really have 
anything to do with Yale? It happened 
in Scarsdale during the summer at the 
home of Bonnie Garland, Herrin's 
girlfriend. He killed her with a ham-
mer while she was sleeping, ostensibly 
because she had told him she wanted to 
date-and sleep with-other men. At 
the time, Herrin had been out of 
school for two years, and Yale would 
not permit Garland to return unless 
she did weU in summer school.
