Professor Leopold Pospisil poses with Kapauku .frimd. 

It must have been a strange sight- five 
hundred Stone Age warriors leading a 
well-clothed European through the 
rain forests of New Guinea. Certainly, 
it was SJrange for the warriors who, 
before this, had never seen a "modern 
man " But, also strange for Leopold 
Posp1 -;il, a Yale anthropology student 
doing research for his doctoral thesis. 
On this expedition into the Kamu 
Valley of West New Guinea, he un-
covered a tribal confederation still un-
touched by the modern world. For 
thirteen months, he lived isolated with 
the Kapauku Papauans gathering data 
on their economy, politics and laws. 
His fmdings 
would 
later raise 
serious doubts about Marxist represen-
tation:. of "primitive society." 

Almost thirty years since that first 
trip in 1954, Leopold Pospisil is still 
continuing his research. Now an ac-
complished professor of anthropology 
at Yale, he returns to New Guinea 
every few summers to study how a 
Stone Age people adjusts to an atomic


era. His detailed observations have led 
him to contradict anthropologists who 
tout "primitive communism," and 
"leaderless egalitarian societies." He 
questions those who claim that the ad-
vance of society is "economically deter-
mined." 

Born and raised in Czechoslovakia, 
Pospisil suffered an 
intellectually-
stifling education dominated by Marx-
ist dogma. Later, when fighting in the 
resistance against the 
Nazis, 
he 
became all the more aware of the risks 
of allowing one man's theories to 
dominate the minds of a nation. This 
background has profoundly influenced 
his research. It is characterized by an 
almost obsessive empiricism and a 
long-standing disdain for the concoc-
tions of armchair theoreticians. So it 
was that when he arrived at the 
rudiments of a theory of law, he decid-
ed to test his ideas against first-hand 
experience. 

He went to study the Eskimo, the 
Hopi 
Indians, 
the Tiroleans of 
Europe, and, in 1954, the Kapauku 
Papauans, a people uninfluenced by 
contempory legal ideas. "When we 
came to the Debai Valley," Pospisil 
said, "the people didn't know whether 
they should kill us or not- they had 
killed everybody else before. And so, 
there was a big discussion lasting about 
half a day with them and then they 
finally decided to let me go through. 
T hey said, 'Alright we'll let you go 
through, but our neighbors further 
deep in the Debai are real bastards. 
They would kill you, so we are going to 
give you two hundred warriors to pro-
tect you.' So, I went deeper into the 
valley and the pattern was repeated. 
The next people said, 'Alright we'll let 
you through but the neighbors are real-
{, bastards, so we give you protection 
of a hundred more people. So, I ap-
peared on the edge of the Kamu valley 
with about five hundred or six hundred 
warriors. It was like a b1g invasion. 
Pospisil in the marktplace. 
"When we came to the 
Debal Valley, the people 
didn't know whether they 
should kill us or not ... " 

And there, underneath, there was 
The first days 
about five or six thousand people 
"When you are exposed to five or six 
waiting for me-just an unbelievable 
thousand people who just ogle you and 
multitude." 

Here in the Kamu valley, Pospisil 
was warmly received by a tribe since 
known as the Kapuaku Papauans. The 
Headman offered to provide him with 
food and lodging and to teach him the 
Kapauku language. Pospisil gladly ac-
cepted, deciding to stay with these peo-
ple and confine his studies to their 
culture. 

Despite the apparent calm of the 
Headman, most of the natives re-
mained both transfixed and terrified 
by Pospisil. Large groups would follow 
his every move, but would flee in all 
directions if he ever approached them. 
Some of the most brave would come up 
to touch him. Pospisil later discovered 
that they wanted to find out if his ligl t 
color was just painted on. In these first 
few weeks, he was much less of an ob-
server than something to be observed. 

watch your every movemen t, you can't 
even go to the forest to relieve yourself. 
And so this was quite a chore, the first 
day. 
"The second day I woke up about six 
o'clock in the morning and the su n was 
not yet up. This is a most beautiful 
time of the day; the birds were singing 
and chirping and everything else was 
absolutely quiet. I thought, 'It is a tee-
rific thing after the big meeting last 
night. It's nice to be alone.' So I opened 
the tent and walked out, and my God, 
I was facing about eight thousand peo-
ple sitting there absolutely quiet and 
staring at the tent. The reaction of the 
people would be similar- maybe more 
shocking for them than for us, if a fly-
ing saucer would land on New H aven 
Green." 

Pospisil kept up an u ntiring effort to 
learn the language. Kapauku is ex-
