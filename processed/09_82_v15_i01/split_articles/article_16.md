1980-81 PMB had 
won 
national 
notoriety for its X-rated shows, for its 
irreverence to the military and the 
White House, and for its obsession 
with phallic symbols. 


That spring the administration was 
eyeing the flood of hate mail with con-
siderable displeasure and not a little 
embarrassment. "We didn't want to get 
involved in censorship," recalled Dean 
of Student Affairs David Henson, the 
man who had to read those letters. 
"But people were really getting offen-

band. Why? For openers, Polinsky,

a battery-operated light-up bowtie and 
wielding a pink fluorescent golf club 
for a conducting mace, Polinsky seem-
ed every bit as unorthodox as his 
predecessors. 


One 
instrumentalist 
remembered him as "loud, eccentric, 
happy-go-lucky Dave." The nettlesome 
question for the band was this: Could a 
musically-illiterate ham like Polinsky 
steer the PMB safely toward the new 
standards of self-censorship demanded 
by the administration? While others
