"What business do I, a worldly man 
mainly acquainted with modern 
philosophy and Marxist theory, have 
speaking to you about mysticism?" 
pondered Professor Louis Dupre as he 
stood before the Cistercian monks. 
The Yale Religious Studies scholar had 
just opened up a series of lectures at 
the Abbey of Gethsemani, a Trappist 
Monastery in Kentucky, where he was 
to discu!ls spirtuality and Christian 
mysticism.

Dupre must have found the monastery 
considerably different from his haunts 
at Yale. For a Trappist's life is one of 
prayer, penance, liturgy, study and 
manual labor. Most of a Trappist's day 
is spent in silence and solitude. And 
this particular monastery, the Abbey 
of Gethsemani, had been for many 
years the home of Thomas Merton, 
one of the best-known spiritual writers 
of the 20th century.
