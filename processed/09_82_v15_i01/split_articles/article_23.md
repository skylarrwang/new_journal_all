contracting a fever in South America." 
"Henry Grethal Designs Sportswear 
Collections with Spirit," the ad pro-

"Has modeling affected your rela-
tions with women?" I asked. 
"No, not really ... people treat me 
differen!}y. When I go out at night, 
though, .I cansee that men don't always 
appfeciate having me around. I found 
that at Yale too." 

Legendary ladles man 
Members of the Yale crew team 
would not be surprised to learn that 
Michael is regarded as a ladies _man in 
New York; his popularity in Florida 
one spring break is still a legend. In his 
1 senior year, Michael stepped off the 
bus in Tampa, and was approached by 
a girl named Tammy. She had seen 
him rowing a year earlier and had 
fallen for hiin. For the whole year, she 
had kept his picture and waited for his 
return. "I wouldn't say that she at-
tacked him but she certainly tried to 
get to know him pretty fast. They saw 
each other for the two weeks of vaca-
tion," said Hal Evans, a heavyweight 
who rowed with Michael for two years. 
"He got along well with men, for 
someone who spent a lot of time with 
girls," Evans said. "Crew is a classic 
test of one's ability to get along with 
guys. You can't be a prima donna or a 
complainer." Another member of the 
team who was competing for the num-
ber five seat said Michael was too nice 
a guy. Usually, on the water he was 
quiet, but always had a sense of 
humor. "We were never sure whether 
he was psyched or not. He acted 
almost nonchalant," said Evans. 
The year . in which he .pegan to 
model, the yarsity boats competed at 
Henley, and Mike rowed in the number 
five seat. His coach, Tony Johnson, a 
lean, relaxed man who has been at 
Yale since 1970, said, "Michael had a 
lot of athletic ability and responded to 
the competition and difficult situations 
with an inner strength." Although 
Johnson felt that M ichael had to adjust 
to the demands of modeling, work and 
rowing, and make some sacrifices, he 
doesn't believe that modeling detracted 
from his performance in the boat. 
Michael never spoke of his modeling 
unless someone asked him, and 
although curious, the team rarely did. 
In fact, it puzzled Hal Evans that 
Michael became a model after gradua-
tion: "It seems like a lot falls into 
Mike's lap." 

Fairy tale discovery 
Michael was surprised that I hadn't 
heard the story of his discovery. "I was 
painting houses one summer on Mar-
tha's Vineyard after my freshman year 
and a 
Vogue photographer named 
Bruce Weber came up and asked, 
'would you mind if we took your pic-
ture?' I asked him how much he would 
pay me, and he told me $60 for the day. 
That was a lot of money. Later, after I 
d id a five page men's section for Vogue 
in April of my sophmore year, I was 
home for two days between Eastern 
Sprints and training for the Harvard 
Race in May. Bruce Weber called on 
Sunday night and said, 'Michael, I 
want you to fly down to New York 
tomorrow, so that we can do some pic-
tures for Valentino.' When I told him 
that I couldn't afford to do that, he said 
they would pay for the day. I figured 
that he meant $60 again, so I said, 'the 
plane is $45 each way and I have to be 
back tomorrow anyhow to go to Con-
necticut ... 'He said, 'Look, we'll pay 
you $500 to come down.' '$500,' I said, 
'Are you kidding?' So I went down in a 
hurry. The same day I met Dan, we 
got along well, and he offered me work 
in New York anytime. W hen summer 
rolled around, I called up and said, 
'were you serious about that offer? Can 
I come to New York?' So I did. And 


that's my story. I'm a discovery. I'm a 
fairy tale, they say." 
"But why did you turn to modeling 
full-time after Yale?" I asked. 
"Well, it was so easy, I mean it was 
right there. I had a couple of teaching 
offers, but you can't make a living do-
ing that. I figured that I could do it for 
a little while, and quit anytime. Also, 
there was no reason not to do it, and I 
kind of wanted to see what would hap-
pen." 

I wondered if a model's lifestyle was 
addictive; you get a little, and you 
always want more. 
"Not for me," he said. "At first I 
hesitated terribly, and the people at the 
agency couldn't believe that I had gone 
back to school. In a way, that became 
part of my appeal, the fact that I had 
gr~duated from Yale. I get a lot of 
mileage out of it." 
"Do the 
self-serving 
aspects of 
Michael 
lves 
modeling bother you?" 
"That's just something I have to ac-
cept. What can I do about it? After all, 
they are paying me, so I am taking as 
much advantage of them as they are of 
me." 

Price of success 
"Sometimes," he continued, "I wish 
that a bus would go by and break my 
nose and I would have to quit, because 
the novelty has really worn ofT. 
"At first, it was really exciting, but 
now it is really work." 
I asked if the work has increased his 
confidence. 
"No, I have gotten more insecure if 
anything. I am not a terribly insecure 
person, I think, but this job can make 
one very insecure. I am spoiled, as I 
said; I have had it easy, and thi:~gs 
have gone well but if I don't work tor 
two ~r three qays, I start to wonder,
