Natural Hazards 
. . 
It's just after midnight on a Monday, and 
I'm in the backseat of a car heading up 1-95 
towards Orange, with Lucas Dreier, a pony-
tailed Yale senior. Val and Liliana, a middle-
aged Connecticut couple that Lucas met 
through a meditation course, are sitting in 
front, talking about India; Lucas is checking 
the batteries in his flashlight. 

About twenty minutes out of New 
Haven, we spot our target: Trader Joe's gro-
cery store, now closed. Lucas directs Val to 
park the car behind a dumpster, out of view 
from the street. "Get your masks out," Lucas 
quips. Armed with flashlights, and keeping . 
our voices low to avoid the night attendant 
on duty, the four of us get out of the car and 
make our way over to a large black dumpster. 
With childlike enthusiasm, Lucas lifts up 
the lid, takes out his flashlight, and jumps in 
among heaps of plastic bags. Wearing only 
sandals, old jeans, and a corduroy shirt 
despite the frigid cold, he eagerly begins to 
tear open the plastic bags 
revealing pack-
aged food mixed in with rotten items, thaw-
ing meat, spoilt vegetables and cracked bot-
tles of tomato sauce. Ignoring the faint

stench, Lucas plunges. his bare hands into a 
bag and discovers, much to his excitement, 
what he calls great finds: cartons of half-and-
half, an intact bag of nuts, bags of frozen veg-
etables, and a hunk of cheddar cheese. 

"The first rule of dumpstering," Lucas 
explains as he rummages, unfazed, through a 
particularly soggy bag of food remains, "is to 
never be hesitant to reach down to the bot-
tom of a disgusting bag 
inevitably, that's 
where the real treat is." Proving his point, he 
happily pulls out a large can of oats, covered 
in organic slime. "Just a little messy," he says, 
"but perfectly good." From inside the dump-
ster, he hands the can over to us, and we add 
it to our growing pile of liberated goods. 

Like me, this is Val and Liliana's first 
time dumpstering, and it shows. When Lucas 
tries to convince them that the "partially-
opened" bag of Belgian chocolate chip cook-
ies are still edible, they pause warily. Lucas 
tosses the cookies onto the pile next to the 
large can of oats. "We'll take cern," he says; 
"My housemates will eat anything." 

Lucas is right: the people with whom he 
lives enjoy dumpstered food daily. They also 
share his passion for recycling, minimal 
resource use, and anti-globalization rhetoric. 

In fact, for Lucas and his seven housemates, 
this is a way of life. They are the original 
founders of the Greenhouse, Yale's first and 
only cooperative living group. 

Started last fall by a group ofYale upper-
rclassmen, the Greenhouse allows students 
who are committed to social justice and envi-
ronmental responsibility to try to live accord-
ing to their ideals. Besides minimizing 
resource use (enter dumpstering), this means 
making all decisions through group consen-
sus, cooking vegetarian or vegan meals 
together, and fostering an ethic of mutual 
cooperation and inter-dependence. Located 
on 125 Dwight Street, the Greenhouse has 
had its fair share of challenges. But now, by all 
accounts, it's thriving. Already, ~eteen Yale 
students have expressed an interest in joining 
next year. 

There is a lot to the Greenhouse beyond 
dumpstering, though it is a vital part of its 
plan to reduce waste (dumpsters behind 
Trader Joe's, Lucas tells me, are recognized 
nationally as "activist goldmines," because of 
the large quantities of packaged food discard-
ed there). The house, with its strong commit-
ment to environmental and social responsibil-
ity, is a haven for Yale's activist community. It
