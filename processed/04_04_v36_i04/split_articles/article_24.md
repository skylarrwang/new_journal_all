walls on the west and north sides of the 
building. Like a good modernist, Kahn put 
functional concerns first and transformed 
Goodwin's three stories into four in order to 
maximize floor space. But the architect's 
most 
striking 
contributions, 
• • 
as many crlttcs 
have noted, are 
evident in the 
Gallery's interi-
or. Kahn want-
ed to make the 
structure of his 
building clear 
to the viewer, so 
he left the raw 
concrete 
sup-
ports 
of the 
building unfin-
ished 
and 
undisguised. 

The brick walls on the building's south side 
were clearly decorative and allowed inches of 
air to flow between them and the ceiling. 
Overhead, an innovative tetrahedronal con-
crete housed light fixtures, air ducts, and 
electrical wiring, all clearly visible to the 
viewer below. When · the Gallery finally 
opened in 1953, Kahn told a reporter at_ the 
Yale Daily News, "I believe in frank architec-
ture. A building is a struggle, not a miracle, 
and the architect should acknowledge this." 
Wtth this in mind, Kahn sought to 
imbue the gallery with a unique balance of 
function and aesthetics. His design empha-
sizes light and fluid movement through 
space: "I hate claustrophobia," Kahn told the 
YDN reporter. In the 2000 YUAG Bulletin, 
Associate Dean of the School of Architecture 
Alexander Purves, explained that Kahn's plan 
departed from Goodwin's because it concen-
trated all the closed spaces (stairs, toilets, ele-
vator shaft) in the center of the building. 
This left the perimeter of each floor open, 
allowing light to stream through the glass 
exterior and flood the space. 

The geometry of the tetrahedronal ceil-
ing is echoed by the concrete cylinder of the 
stairwell and links the lateral movement 
within each floor to the vertical rise of the 
building. The steps aspire up a triangular 
path towards a terrazzo triangle floating 
above the column on a shallow ring of win-
dows. The triangles hovering above enabled 
Kahn to overcome the spatial requirements of 
a low ceiling to create a continuous sense of 
upward movement. 

Kahn's innov-
auve 
pogo-
panels" (panels 
pressed between 
the ceiling and 
floor on pogo- · 
like springs) can 
be 
moved to 
accomodate 
exhibitions and 
create rooms as 
needed. Vincent 
Scully 
noted 
that the panels 
served an aes-
thetic purpose 
as well, separat-
ing the art from the frame and making object 
more "intensely alive." The pogo-panels 
themselves, set on skinny legs, seem almost 
anthropomorphic, 
active agents in Kahn's 
space, much like the viewers themselves. 

set on the panels separate from the concrete 
structure and become active agents in Kahn's 
immense space, with the tetrahedrons contin-
uing ever onward and light sweeping above, 
below, and around the panels, the art stands 
still and encourages the viewer to stand still 
with it. After some time the sweeping move-
ment of light and air impels the viewer on to 
the next panel, then after some time, to the 
next, pausing at each stop to identify with the 
art. Within Kahn's open galleries, the panels 
encourage students to forge intimate connec-
tions with objects Scully calls "protected from 
barbarism and from time." 

n practice, fe'w, if any, of the building's 
floors have ever experienced Kahn's imag-
ine4 openness. When the Gallery opened, 
it was dominated by .the temporary walls for 
dassrooms, · studios, storage facilities, and 
offices. The fourth floor was entirely unob-
structed but was used as a drafting room for 
architecture students instead of exhibition 
space. In 1963 many of the facilities were 
moved to the new Art and Architecture 
building, but the Gallery remained cluttered 
with offices and conservation labs. Ironically, 
as Scully, Purves, and Cunningham have all 
noted, Kahn's movable panels did not make 
the display of art more fluid 
rather, they 
allowed its inhabitants to cannibalize the 
space more easily. The architect had once 
boasted to the YDN, "A good building is one 
which the client cannot destroy by wrong use 
of space. Almost all the partitions ·are mov-
able, so whenever the space is needed for 
something else, they can fit the space to suit 
their need without ruining anything." 

Although the panels did enable the Gallery to 
adapt to suit the changing needs of students 
and staff, they had a disastrous impact on the 
building's character and effect. 

Perhaps the most alarming desecrations 
of the space have occurred when curators 
have fai:led to understand Kahn's intentions. 
Andrew Carduff Ritchie, who came from 
MoMA to serve as director of the Yale Gallery 
in 1957, was the first to manipulate the pan-
els wrongly. In The Art Museums of Louis I 
Kahn, Patricia C 
· gs Loud suggests that 
Ritchie, "concerned about the increasing 
numbers of works of art he had to 
display ... set .about 'remodeling' the Yale 
Gallery to create a more neutral effect, more 
like that in the Museum of Modem Art." 

Ritchie installed white walls to trade the 
building's openness for more definite rooms, 

and used smooth panels to hide much of the 
unfinished concrete so essential to the build-
ing's raw effect. Even the concrete staircase, 
one of Kahn's principal elements, was con-
cealed from view. 

Over the years, the cylinder's panels have 
been removed, but the offices and storage 
space continue to create a sense of Kahn's 
hated claustrophobia. The southern brick 
wall was hidden behind the walls of a gift 
shop, and black screens spanned the crucial 
space between the pogo-panels and the floor. 
In 1962, Scully bemoaned the building's mis-
use but offered some consolation: "some day 
it will obviously be rectified." 

That ch,ty, apparently, is today, though 
the process began informally some time back. 
Pointing 
to 
an 
exposed 
brick 
wall, 
Cunningham credited Mary Gardner Neill, 
Gallery director in the early 90s, as "one of 
the first people to start chipping away at the 
archeological layers" of the building. "Over 
the years," she added, "as we've taken the 
walls down from around the cylinder, taken 
the wall down from the south brick wall, 
curators keep seeing how the installations are 
only improved as we return [the Gallery] clos-
er to what Kahn envisioned." 

Though the basement and fourth floors 
will still contain some offices and storage 
space, the renovated Gallery will actually be 
closer to "Kahn's original vision" than it was 
in 1953. Unrestricted exhibition space will 
span much of the first and all of the second 
and third floors. Most imponantly, the pogo-
panels will be used more thoroughly within 
these open spaces. In his article in YUAG's 
2000 Bulletin, Alexander Purves explained 
that after Ritchie's renovations of the late 
1950s, " ... never again did [Kahn] allow the 
primary spatial experience of his architecture 
to be at the mercy of secondary panition loca-
tions." The pogo-panel, the very thing that 
enabled hacking and clutter, when used cor-
rectly, will make the museum a unique 
expression of light and structure. In its purest 
incarnation, each floor of Kahn's building 
would be an unobstructed expanse, populated 
only by these panels, the artWork, and the 
viewers themselves, with the ceiling and cylin-
der guiding us steadily upward. By next sum-
mer, students will be able to visit the museum 
once again, and to experience Kahn's space as 
never before.
