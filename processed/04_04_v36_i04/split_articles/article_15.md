Friendly Fire 
During the week, David Heinig, a field 
technician for Qualxserv, frequently answers 
calls from Yale's Information Technology 
Services to service computers throughout 
campus. Several weekends a month, however, 
Heinig steps out of the information age and 
into the Old West. In a wooded area adjacent 
to Quonniquag Lake in rural North 
Guilford, he orchestrates shooting events as 
Territorial Governor of the Bluffhead 
Bushwackers, a cowboy action shooting soci-
ety. In these parts, Heinig is known simply as 
"Cayuse," and the only troubleshooting he 
does is with a gun. Like "Cayuse," every 
member adopts an alias, as required by the 
Bushwackers' parent organization. The name, 
which must be original among the 54,000 
members of the Single Action Shooting 
Society (SASS), is often tied to a fictitious or 
real gunslinger and, combined with a little 
research, helps its holder spawn a new per-
sona complete with period costume and gun 
collection. The sport thus becomes less a 
recreational activity and more a transforma-
• twn. 
For "Cayuse," that transformation 
means donning the styles of the 1880s-
cowboy boots, spurs, buckles, and belts 
proper eye and ear protection for the entire 
day as he fires replicas of 19th century pistols, 
rifles and shotguns at steel targets. He is 
joined in this passion by almost a hundred 
fellow Bushwackers, only ten of whom are 
women. They come out, like their Territorial 
Governor, to enjoy the woods and the good 
company. For these die-hard Bushwhackers, 
living out a youthful infatuation with a game 
of "Cowboys and Indians" is all in a Sunday's 
work. 
Recently, Bushwackers under aliases like 
"Doc Red thumb," "Philetus Fine Shoot," 
and "Col.]. L. Chamberlain" gathered for an 
early morning safety meeting, after which 
they split into three posses to embark on a 
weekend ritual. With spectators standing ju~t 
twenty feet away, the participants trotted, 
one at a time, between shooting stations, 
pulling guns from their holsters and aiming 
them at the· "critters" 
steel targets shaped 
like coyotes, chickens, bears, bunnies, and 
buffalo, as well as the less traditional whiskey 
jugs and enemy cowboys 
that populate 
three clearings in the otherwise towering 
woods. A safety officer. jogs close behind with 
a timer in hand. At each of the three stations, 
the shooters execute stages according to 
detailed scenarios penned by the Territorial 
Governor. Stage two, for example, is entitled 
"Sunday Morning Buggy Ride," with instruc-
tions that read: "You and the misses are out 
for a Sunday Morningbuggy ride when you 
take a bum steer· and wind up face to face 
with some onry critters. Lucky that you 
brought your greener and can take care of the 
matters." Above the scenario descriptions and 
the directions are Microsoft Paint-created 
digital diagrams with trajectories linking the 
' 
stations from which to shoot (a wooden out-
house, a jail, and a swaying buckboard) to the 
critters. The· trajectories are color-coded 
according to the 
type 
of gun . 
required: a shot- · 
gun, rifle or pis-
tol. 
A running 
commentary 
between 
participants 
breaks up the 
booming 
gun 
shots. "I knew I 
was gomg to 
shoot over that 
chicken;" "No 
misses;" and the 
playful-bicker-
ing of wife-hus-
band rivalries. 
Scoring is based 
both on accura-
cy and the over-
all time spent 
completing each 
stage, but the 
only spoils 
a 
wmner IS grant-
• ed are playful 
- bragging rights. 
Most 
of the 
morrung IS pep-
r 
; pered with the 
-~ alternating 
· forceful sounds 
- of firing guns and clink of ejected shells. 
Earplugs limit conversation, but, even so, fre-
quent jovial exchanges display the group's 
pleasant rapport. 

The Bushwackers are part of a growing 
• ' national community created through SASS. 
· The 115-page February issue of The Cowboy 
• · Chronicle, the monthly SASS journal, features 
articles by "Aimless Annie," "Palaver Pete," 
· ' and "J .E. B. Stuart" but doesn't mention a sin-
gle legal name. This is a testament to the 
•12 
unique, tight-knit community, that has devel-
oped across the country among · those who 
share an enthusiasm for .cowboy action shoot-
• mg. 
While "Cayuse~' oversees planning for the 
Bushwacker branch of this extended family, 
another member takes responsibility for keep-· 
ing it safe. On a chilly, drizzly morning, "Lazy 
Ace Bob," leaves his Wall Street job as a port-
folio manager to enter the backwoods. I-fere . 
he takes on the title of Head Safety ·officer, a 
job he takes just as seriously. "Lazy Ace Bob" 
is re·sponsible for making sure SASS safety reg-
ulations are followed, 
such as adherence to 
the "170 degree safe-
ty plane." Shooters 
must. keep their guns 
pointed at their tar-
get at all times: if the 
barrel of their gun 
strays more than 8 5 
degrees . in 
either 
direction, they are 
dis.qualified. . · 
. 
Safe though the 
environment may be, 
it is still extremely 
noisy. 
Neighbors 
complain consistent-
. ly, though "Cayuse" 
says he has been able 
to appease them by 
. restricting shooting 
hours. The group's 
forthcoming under-
ground 
shooting 
facility 
project 
which necessitated a 
five hundred dollar 
contribution 
from 
each 
member--
should 
improve 
Bushwacker-neigh-
bor relations. 
Despite 
com-
plaints from non-
participants, single action shooting is the 
fastest-growing shooting sport in the nation. 
The rules are simple and non-restrictive: all 
participants must wear period clothing, follow 
the safety guidelines, join SASS and be over 
the age of twelve. After trying several shooting 
disciplines, "Cayuse" settled with cowboy 
action shooting because he found it to be the 
most fun and ]east competitive. For the past 
seven years he has participated in the sport 
and in 2000 he founded the Bushwackers . 
Now, as Territorial Governor, he tries to give 
his crew a special niche within SASS. The 
members' names are chosen with care, with 
consideration of their historical weight and 
with the personalities of their holders in 
mind. So when choosing a name for the club, 
"Cayuse" was also careful. He thought "Bluff 
Head," 
which 
refers 
to 
where 
Bushwackers hold their meetings had to be 
incorporated. The chosen name naturally 
. suits a club which "Cayuse" has been mold-
ing. from its infancy to stand-out. "It did not 
take long to settle on 'Bushwackers,"' the 
club's website explains. ''A quick check of The 
Chronicle 
reveals 
few 
'Vigilantes,' 
'Regulators,' and 'Shootists,' but there's only 
'B h 
k 
' "
