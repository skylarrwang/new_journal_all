Mall is empty and silent, save for the consistent and quiet hum of

gent Downtown New Haven," proclaimed the firm's webpage. 
Attached to his text, too, was an· artistic rendering of the "new lower 
Chapel," the ambitious re-development projects spearheaded by 
William Jackson Ewing (WJE). The new mall was to showcase upscale 
retail development, an outward facing food market, and well-known 
anchor stores, promised but unnamed. The firm envisioned Chapel 
Square as a "live, work and play destination" and, the website added, 
"Chapel Square will integrate a wide mix of shops, restaurants, sidewalk 
-1' 
-
cafes and a European fresh food market,'catering to a broad spectrum 
of area residents, employees _and visitors to the area." 'For over a year at 
national retail conferences and. expositions, .. the firm's marketing staff 
pushed this presentation--complete with mockup mall_ - touting the 
city, the market, and the project to reel in potential tenants. 


By any measure, both New Haven city officials and Yale administrators 
were happy. New Haven had landed a national development 
team with a portfolio of high profile projects such as Union Station in 
Washington D.C. and New York's Grand Central Station. New Haven 
was finally slated to "tie together the historic campus of Yale University, 
the Broadway shopping corridor, the surging residential Ninth Square, 
and Downtown's renowned theater and arts district." The mall, one of 
the biggest eyesores in the downtown area and the behemoth foil to the 
quaint Yale-managed boutiques of upper Chapel Street, - was finally 
. ready for its facelift. 


The Chapel Square Mall, 160,000 square feet of enclosed shopping 
space, opened as part of New Haven's new wave of development began 
in the 1960s. In 1965, it was a New Haven dream-come-true: an urban 
shopping complex, with department stores like Macy's and Malley's. It 
was no longer necessary to visit two, three or four specialty shops. 
Because the mall contained 
· 
under one roof, early advertisements promised escape from the whims of Northeastern weather. 


A few years after its completion, the project began to falter. In 
1972, mounting debts incurred by the development team caused a 
shakeup in the mall's ownership. At the same time, competition from 
new suburban mega-malls and a population decline in the inner city 
led to a drastic fall in sales throughout the downtown market. Rising 
crime in the 1980s presented another hurdle. Malley's closed its doors 
in 1982, and in 1993 Macy's too left for greener pastures. Today, the 
Macy's building still sits vacant, a shell of the old embossed logo presiding over a crumbling door. 


In all that time, the Mall 
has 
undergone 
several 
attempted 
improvements. 
Besides three mini-renovations and leasing drives, it saw 
a 1997 revitalization effort in 
conjunction with the then-
new Omni Hotel New Haven . 
Baltimore developer David 
Cordish, the man behind the 
renovation, 
envisioned an 
interior passage to link the 
hotel to the markets, much 
like the hugely successful 
Chicago Omni Hotel and 
shopping complex, also by. 
Cordish. By the time New 
Haven's Omni opened, however, the proposed passage was 
already shut, and remains so today. 


So far, attempts to resurrect Chapel Square Mall have all fallen 
short 
and most experts are not surprised. ''I've been dubious that 
there was sufficient market for retail [in that space] for 30 years," said 
Alexander Garvin, commissioner on the New York City Planning 
Commission and professor of Urban Planning and Management at Yale 
"There is not a lot of demand there currently. There have to be many 
more people - residents, office workers or people coming into town. 
What you need is a market and people to fill up the space." 


Over the past ten years, downtown New Haven has experienced an 
economic boom 
led, many say, by Yale's drive to focus energy and 
money in the areas around campus. After years of fiscal austerity in the 
1980s, the Yale of the 1990s injected the overflow from its burgeoning 
endowment into the city, buying up property in three areas: Broadway, 
Chapel Street and Science Hill. 


Since the beginning of President 
Levin's term, much of the property closest to campus has changed 
hands: from local owners to the Yale corporation. Currently, Yale owns 
the majority of the area two square miles outside of central campus, not 
only in the key Chapel and Broadway areas but also south of campus 
in the Audubon area and along the artery that connects central campus 
with the medical school. Yale's involvement and investments, however, 
drop off rapidly just blocks from the residential colleges. 


That a prestigious firm such as WJE would develop property out-
side of the traditional hot zones surprised some. Still, Michael Morand, 
Vice President of the Yale Office of New Haven and State Affairs, 
declared it a natural progression of the investment that Yale and the city 
had been making in the downtown area. "There is no city in 
Connecticut that is doing nearly as well as New Haven is. The fact of 
continuing private investment speaks to its strength," he said. 


The actual development team that was slated to be involved with 
the project was picked by an ad-hoc selection committee composed of 
local city officials, among them Anthony Rescignio, director of the 
Chamber of Commerce; Scott Healy, director of the Town Green 
Special Services District; representatives · from the Mayor's office; local 
business owners; and Bruce Alexander, the director of the Yale Office 
of New Haven and State Affairs. "We chose the developers based upon 
some pretty dynamic presentations, with WJE head and shoulders 
above the others. It was exciting to see the initial architectural render-
ings, and the letters of intent," said Scott Healy. 


ut things began to go downhill quickly. The original financier for 
the plan withdrew, leaving a void in the funding that was filled 
by Lubert Adler partners, a Philadelphia-based real estate invest-
ment group. David Nyberg, a Lubert Adler employee, is also the head 
of a city development firm called Chapel Street LLC, located in New 
Haven. "David Nyberg and Lubert Adler stepped in to make the pro-
posal possible. The committee was very happy with the decision that 
was made," said Healy. Neither Nyberg and Lubert Adler officials 
responded to repeated emails and calls requesting comment. 


Despite the new funding, the plan still drew its critics. In 2003, 
the Mall's previous tenants 
local merchants such as Cross Flava 
Records 
sued WJE over unlawful eviction. Though WJE ultimately 
prevailed, the confrontation brought the project to a standstill for 
almost five months and also soured public opinion on the project. The 
suits reinforced an old line of criticism: at what cost to the local popu-
lation was this project advancing, and for whom was the redeveloped 
mall being created? Philosophical questions aside, WJE's actions were 
legal. The leasing documents for these businesses show that they were 
operating under public subsidy; their rent did not even cover the build-
ing's utilities. According to Scott Healey, ''Any of these businesses that 
had a viable business plan would be able to find space elsewhere in 
downtown, at market rates." 


Throughout the summer, when the first new retail tenants had been 
scheduled to open, the project remained in a deadlock. Though Yale 
sent representatives to the committee that picked the development 
group, Yale news releases about the project were nowhere to be found. 
New Haven local news rarely covered its 
progress. -Then, in a January 2004 interview -
with 
the 
New 
Haven 
Register, 
Henry 
Fernandez, the mayorial office's economic 
development czar, broke the news: everything 
had fallen apart. The WJE development team 
was no longer a principal player in the project. 
Gone too was any mention of the plan from 
the WJE webpage that had earlier heralded 
Chapel Square as the number one upcoming 
site under development. And by January 2004, 
the date originally set for completion, the space 
still sat mostly vacant, in stark contrast to the 
bustling crowds filling the glass-fronted atrium 
in the WJE brochure. "The people who were 
on the committee were not kept in the loop 
about how the plans progressed," said Healey. 


Two people close to the project, who prefer not 
to be named, said they had felt growing impatience from Lubert Adler in the face of a weakened national retail market. In the intervening 
months the local political scene had changed as 
well. Controversy over the fate of the block 
directly adjacent to Chapel Square likely played 
a role in the Chapel development. While one side of the original site 
faces the hustle and bustle of the New Haven shopping district, the 
other side faces the. soon-to-be demolished Coliseum and the dilapidated Macy's complex. According to sources involved with the development process, "WJE grew 
increasingly 
interested 
in 
acquiring and developing this 
attached site as well. 


The city had other plans. In 
1999, Mayor John DeStefano 
requested state funding to move 
Gateway Community College 
from Long Wharf to downtown. "The future of the site 
directly adjacent to it was in 
doubt. "WJE couldn't get the 
city to commit to even street 
level retail if they moved 
Gateway in," said Healey. This 
would effectively isolate the 
new retail in an island 
separating it from other properties, 
and walling it in between two 
colleges. College students, by 
most counts, are not ideal cus-
tomers. "The issue is not 
whether or not Gateway brings 
the right type of clientele downtown. Looking at Bridgeport or 
Hartford there is no increase in 
the business in the area right around the college. Yale students, too, are 
not the greatest customers," said Healey. The city saw the Gateway project as only a small piece of a larger plan. According to Roland Lamar, 
the Mayor's press secretary, DeStefano "wanted to use this to secure 
money towards multiple projects ... moving the college downtown, 
bringing in the Long Wharf Theatre, and paying for the demolition of 
the Coliseum." The Mayor's office and economic development team, 
led by Henry Fernandez, aimed for a holistic redevelopment of the city. 


"There is going to be 
a better campus for 
Gateway. We think 
it will also make 
going 
to 
college 
more attractive for 
our 
residents. 
Similar to the num-
ber of people who 
chose Yale over, for 
example, Dartmouth 
based on seeing New 
Haven, 
[students] 
might look at the 
_ 
new Gateway and 
make 
decision 
based on that," said 
Lamar.

"WJE, has taken a 
different focus now 
that Nyberg is at its helm. He wants to try something new and previously untested in the downtown area: sacrificing the space earmarked 
for retail to increase the amount of residential space. This is appropriate considering the previous work done by the developers; while WJE
