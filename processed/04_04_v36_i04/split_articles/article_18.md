with between them." Michael met them so 
briefly that he wasn't even sure of their 
names. 

The decision is made in the "best inter-
ests of the patient," said Dr. Sledge. He agrees 
that the notion that the patient doesn't know 
what is in her best interest is "kind of pater-
nalistic. But I would rather err on this side 
than on rhe side of neglect. As a physician 
this will always be my bias." 

Michael is currently in the process of 
applying for readmission to Yale which, Dr. 
Siggins emphasizes, is nothing like applying 
for the first time. "We generally anticipate 
that all students will be coming back," she 
said. Flora also took time off, but on a leave 
of absence, rather than on medical leave. She 
spent last semester with her aunt, working 
full-time to help pay for medication and 
appointments with a psychiatrist and a social 
worker and for medication 
all told, a sum 
of $500. Flora did this voluntarily, 
but Michael was forced to pay for his 
treatment during his year off, "plac-
ing a great strain on my family finan-
cially," he said. 


"I needed to go off all these medica-
tions, and I couldn't do that outside of the 
Hospital," she said, a fact which she and her 
psychiatrist, who is not associated with 
UHS, agreed upon. After a day or so, space 
at the Hospital opened up: There was no 
need for an emergency UHS visit, or an 
ambulance ride under restraints. "I took a 
taxi," she said simply. 

Paige, drained of medications, was 
tremendously depressed upon her entrance 
to the hospital. At "times she could hardly get 
out of bed. After two weeks, she didn't want 
to leave. "My insurance kicked me out. I 
was scared to go." She called the Hospital a 
"first-rate place" and was very happy with 
the team of people attending to her, from · 
Dr. Milstein to her nurse, and even "down to 
the medical student on my case." Last sum-
mer, U.S. News & World Report ranked the 
hospital as the seventh best psychiatric hos-
pital in the nation, and the fourth best in the 
northeast (the ranking was computed "sole-
ly on reputation" by sending surveys to ran-
domly-selected psychiatrists). 

Because she was there over the summer, 
Paige didn't have to face the committee that 
can force medical leave. She ended up fol-
lowing her doctor's advice of taking a year 
off anyway, simply declaring a leave of 
absence and retaining the right to come back · 
to Yale the following year, no questions 
asked. 

Paige said she could understand, 
though, why some students hated their expe-
riences at the Hospital. "I suspect that the 
fact that some visits are involuntary and the 
fact that students face geuing kicked out of 
Yale lead to people's anger towards. the 
Hospital." She agreed as well, that some stu-
dents are sent there who don't need to be 
there. "[Mental hygiene] is really quick to 
hospitalize. 
Sometimes people end up 
there 
not without reason 
but who don't 
need to be there. I went there really wanting 
to get better. I think that's not the case for 
some. And that could make you bitter. If you 
spend the whole time fighting the fact that 
you're there, it will make you more 
depressed." Even so, she was baffled to find 
some students describe it "as if it were as bad 
as Mexican prison." Paige only had one crit-
icism of the Hospital: "It's true. The food is 
bad." 

ot so long ago, Flora had a very bad 
weekend, but she, at least, had no one 
to fall back on. She was as depressed 
as she was the night she went to University 
Health, and then to the Hospital last year. 
"I felt actually suicidal," she said. "But I 
knew if I went to UHS they would have h~s­
pitalized me 
with good reason, in terms of 
liability. I couldn't hide it that I was suicidal, 
and in their viewpoint it ~ould have made 
sense. So I didn't go, and I just stared at my 
pills across the room for two days. Before, 
there were a couple of friends I'd call, but I 
know now they'd say I should be in the 
Hospital. So I just deal with it on my own." 

Though Dr. Sledge wouldn't comment 
on any specific cases, when presented with 
one similar to Flora's 
a composite of the 
dissatisfied ex-residents at WS2, those who 
hate or are afraid of the people who were sup-
posed to help them 
he said that at such a 
point, he didn't think the Hospital could do 
anything. Hopefully, he added, the student 
would still forge a strong relationship with a 
University· Health therapist. "I don't think 
for a moment that what we do is perfecr," 
said Dr. Sledge, "or that we don't do things 
that sometimes make people feel dehuman-
ized. I know we do. When it happens, it's 
because of safety concerns, not a sadistic 
urge. 
"That's a tragedy 
someone who's 
alienated, who needs care. It's something we 
should try very hard to correct."
