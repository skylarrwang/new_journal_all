The Peabody Museum of Natural 
History will soon have a symbol to define its 
role in the Yale-New Haven community: a 
twenty-one foot long dinosaur sculpture. But 
the museum didn't opt for a well-known or 
particularly graceful species of dinosaur; 
instead, its curators chose the torosaurus; an 
obscure herbivore from the Late Cretaceous 
period that is closely related to the tricer:.. 
a tops. 

The torosaurus, along with several species, 
was first named and 
described by 0. C. 
Marsh, a 19th cen-
tury Yale paleontolo-
gist. Then again, 
Marsh also identi-
fied five hundred 
other more promi-
nent dinosaurs, such 
as the stegosaurus 
and the triceratops. 
So why did the 
Peabody choose the 
torosaurus? 
And 
why 
does 
Peabody 
need 
a 
twenty-one 
foot 
long bronze statue anyway? 

The 
museum's 
Curator of Vertebrate 
Paleontology, Jacques Gaultier, first hatched 
the idea in 2000, when he suggested erecting 
up a sculpture to give the Peabody an identi-
fiable icon. Gaultier started the search for a 
sculptor outside the Peabody community, but 
when exhibit creator and prepartor Michael 
Anderson heard about the plan, he jumped at 
the opportunity. In fact, he is still so still so 
wildly passionate about the project that he 
can't imagine why the Peabody didn't imme-
diately consider offering the job to one of its 
own staff members. "This is what I do, this is 
what I've been trained to do. My background 
is anatomy and sculpture. I couldn't believe 
it," he said. When Richard Burger, director of 
Museum, asked him 
to put together a few 
proposals. Anderson 
agreed and began the 
search for the perfect 
dinosaur. 

"The one that I was 
really interested in 
doing 
was 
Torosaurus; 
that 
would be the most 
.. 
fun to sculpt," Anderson said. He was lucky: 
when Peabody Museum Director Dr. Richard 
Burger saw Anderson's torosaurus model, he 
chose it before even looking at the others. 

Still, neither Yale nor the Peabody had 
APRil. 2004 
approved the sculpture, and the project had 
no funding. The preliminary stages of the 
project took two years to complete, so 
Anderson used the time to refine his 
torosaurus model. He . traveled to the 
Smithsonian and worked with its paleontolo-
. gists and preparators to create a more accurate 
model. He presented this second version of 
the torosaurus to the Peabody curators in the 
summer of 200 1. They loved it, but the pro-
ject still needed funding and approval from 
Yale's Outdoor Sculpture Committee, which 
has the responsibility to oversee the place-
ment of sculptures on the campus. By the 
summer of 2002, Yale had approved the 
sculpture and the project received all of its 
funding from an "individual that cannot be 
named." 

With 
approval 
funding 
cleared, 
Anderson immersed himself in the project. 
He went back to the Smithsonian's paleon-
tologists and "picked their brains for a couple 
of days," returning to Yale with -~:me-sixth 
scale 
triceratops 
bone 
casts. 
(Because 
torosaurus bones are much rarer than those of 
the triceratops and the 
two have ·very similar 
structures, Anderson 
and the paleontologists 
agreed to use the tricer-
atops 
skeleton 
reconstruct 
torosaurus.) 

When he finished the 
one-sixth scale model, 
Anderson upgraded to 
one-third 
model, building first the skeleton then the 
musculature. Now Anderson has moved the 
sculpture to his house in Guilford and is 
crafting the skin, which he hopes to complete 
by the end of April. 

A few blocks away from his house, another 
team · of worker~ is using a point-matching 
method to build the dinosaur up to full scale. 
Once the life-size sculpture is completed, it ' 
will be taken to bronze casters, and the ' • 
bronze sculpture will be returned to the 
Peabody, where it will be mounted on· an · 
I 
eight-foot tall, fifteen-foot long block of, 
granite 
Anderson 
will ' 
finally 
see 
his 
"dream project" in • 
completion . . 

Meanwhile, 
Peabody still hasn't 
set a completion . 
date or location for 
$400,000 
sculpture. 
Tentatively, 
the ; 
torosaurus will be 
mounted in front 
of the museum, at 
Whitney 
and ' 
Satchem. But due , 
to the large dawn redwood in the area, dissat -
isfied architects are perusing Whitney for 
other possible sites. 

The project won't be completed for at least . 
another year, but five years is not an abnor-
mal!y long time span for such a project. Since 
committing to reconstructing the torosaurus, . 
Anderson has learned a lot about dinosaurs. ' 
He usually studies and works with the facial 
bone structure and muscle arrangement of 
hominids,. specifically the Australopithecus: · 
the species on which he wrote his this is what 
he wrote his Masters thesis. While there are 
basic similarities in the musculature and 
skeletal build of hominids and dinosaurs, 
Anderson knew very little about reconstruct-
ing dinosaurs and Teptiles. He realized that . 
dissecting reptiles and birds would help him . 
better understand the torosaurus' muscula- · 
ture. So he began to study and dissect reptiles, 
including crocodiles and iguanas, as well as a 
few birds. He is also checking with experts _ 
about every decision he makes along the way. 
''I'm really pleased with how much effortJ 
went into this thing, how much we 
researched it," Anderson said. "We have back--
up on every decision we made." 

But the Peabody has a history of blunders in 
its reconstructions, from "The Age of 
Reptiles," Rudolph .ZaiJinger's mural in the 
Great Hall 
all the animals in it are now 
understood to be grossly misrepresented 
to . 
the apatosaurus reconstruction, which is the 
the most iconic thing the Peabody has right •
