Taylor Mali, former national champion 
performance poet, was wearing an American 
flag pin on the lapel of his blazer. An unset-
tled feeling began to grow among the twenty 
Yale students in the room. Mali's prea,cher-
like baritone voice, squeezed into a hurried 
introduction, made him sound like a nervous 
stand-up comic; The audience. wondered if 
this poet's jive would be a departure from the 
typical anti-elitist, disenfranchised tone that 
is endemic to slam poetry. After all, slam 
poetry, the illegitimate child of poetry and 
hip-hop, popularized but commercially mis-
represented by Russell Simmons' Def Poetry 
Jam, is characterized by rebellion 
against 
academia, against government, but most of 
all, against itsel£ In fact, the genre is in dan-
ger of disintegrating because the poets them-
selves refuse to identify with the movement. 
Slam poetry, as Mali has said, is best defined 
by its medium, which is performance art. It 
doesn't exist on the page or in the mind but 
in the audience's reaction, which waivers 
between a strange empowerment and submis-
sion to the sheer volume of his emphatic, 
staccato votce: 
He says the problem with teachers is, 
"What's a kid going to learn 
from someone who decided his best 
option in life was to become a teacher?" 
He reminds the other dinner guests that 
it's true what they say about 
teachers: 
Those who can, do; those who can't, 
teach. 

I decide to bite my tongue instead of his 
and resist the temptation to ·remind the 
dinner guests 
that it's also true what they say about 
lawyers. 
Because we're eating, after all, and this is 
polite company 
Mali believes that every poet should have 
twenty minutes of material to "instruct and 
entertain" any audience, whether it be a room 
of eighth graders or George Bush. Mali took 
a break from a twelve year teaching career to 
bring his philosophy to the road and accom-
plish his goal of encouraging young people to 
become teachers. His formula for change 
combines his classroom experience with a 
dash of anti-elitism thrown in as a token trib-
ute to the genre. To inspire others, Mali 
describes his. proudest moment as a teacher-
the opening of a young girl's mind: 
I'm writing the poem that will change 
the world, 
and it's Lilly Wilson at my office door. 
Lilly is writing a research paper for me 
about how homosexuals shouldn't be 
allowed. 
to adopt children ... 
... I can't believe I'm saying this, Mr. 
Mali, 
but I think I'd like to switch sides. 
And I want to tell her to do more than 
just believe it, 
but to enjoy it! 


When M_ali brings his show down south, 
however, he censors himsel£ To a conservative 
audience, for instance, Lilly's initial objection 
is no longer to gay parenthood, but to allow-
ing Muslims to ride commercial flights. He 
argues that this less controversial issue teach-
es a similar les-
son of open-
mindedness, but 
the 
audience 
accepts this les-
son more readi-
ly. 
In his cen-
sorship, 
Mali 
says he strives to 
be a uniter, not a 
divider. 
Mter 
reading a few 
poems 
gaugmg 
reactions 
and 
political 
lean-
ings of the audi-
ence, he offers 
the aside that his 
flag pin is worn 
out of critical 
irony, intended 
to mock overt 
patriotism. His 
audience can't help but become skeptical, 
wondering if the symbol might change mean-
ing the next time he tours the south. 
Raphi Soifer, on the other hand, wears 
no ambiguous symbols on his lapel. A Yale 
Senior and native of the Seattle area, Soifer 
became involved with slam poetry during a 
year off he spent at home before his freshman 
year, touring local poetry cafes by night. He 
describes himself as, "a performer first, and a 
poet second," but he became disillusioned 
with the genre of slam poetry soon after he 
and a Yale team made it to the national finals 
during his freshman year. 
At ·a typical poetry slam, ftYe judges are 
randomly picked from the audience to assign 
a score from one to ten following each per-
formance. As Mali explains, to win, a poet 
must immediately adapt to reach his audi-
ence,and make his poetry accessible to every-
one present. Indeed, academic poets would 
hardly stand a chance in the slam arena. 
During competition, accessibility can become 
a constraint. For Mali, it is just an inconve-
nience, forcing him to hand pick his poems 
and discard a taboo here and there; for Soifer, 
it robs slam poetry of the freedom that is its
