ike the set for a movie that will never be made, the stretch of 
Orange Street between Chapel and Crown is so empty that it 
· hard to imagine anyone has ever lived there. The storefronts 
are vacant. Picture windows gape at idle sidewalks. Cars rarely pass. 
This is the Ninth Square, a New Haven neighborhood undergoing vast 
renovations with the goal of attracting upscale retail. Further down 
Orange Street, there are new and expensive restaurants, but for now 
this block is still gray and deserted. 

But the Ninth Square is not entirely dead. Though dark and 
unwatched, 60 Orange Street isn't actually vacant. A red ribbon, cut 
long ago at a celebration of the space's opening, bangs limp by the per-
petually, curiously unlocked door. Inside, scrappy wooden pedestals 
support sculptures of lounging, curvaceous women, who stand sentry 
over the naked interior. And at the room's front wind-ow, two life-size 
. . 
painted penguins stare out at the rare passerby who invariably ignores 
them. 

Sixty Orange Street is a temporary display space for the Society of 
Connecticut Sculptors, a Hartford-based artist guild founded twelve 
years ago. According to the society's mission statement, the guild was 
born when "the artistic climate was so overwhelmingly opposed to any

hint of realism in art that it was almost impossible for us to show our 
work." Tlie penguin sculptures are the creations of D.C. French, a New 
Haven resident and member of the Society's Board of Directors. He 
speaks proudly of the society, whose membership has recently increased 
to over a hundred area sculptors. 

The guild helps to fill in an important gap in New Haven's art 
scene. As French admits, "It's sort of a struggle to be a local artist in 
New Haven." For a city bursting with well-regarded museums and 
ambitious art students, New Haven has very few outlets to display the 
work of its local talent. The New Haven Paint and Clay Club, the old-
est artist guild in America, now widely admired throughout New 
England, grew out of such a need. "We were originally founded in 
1900 by a group of artists, most of whom were connected to the Yale 
School of Art," explains artist Dolores Gall, the group's president. "For 
sixty or seventy years, it was the only way to display work in New 
Haven apart from through the Yale University An Gallery, and the 
British Art Center didn't even open until '77, but of course we're not 
British anyway," she says, chuckling. The Paint and Clay Club broke 
off from the Yale Galleries, which seek to exp-ose the Yale p-opulation to 
foreign work, leaving local artists largely n nsupp-orted. 


Following the Paint and Clay Club's example, other New Haven 
artists have recently banded together to form loose guilds. These groups 
do not solicit established galleries but try to establish their own spaces 
to showcase their work. The galleries are not typical: ArtSpace, Elm 
City Artists Guild, and the Society of Connecticut Sculptors are reno-
vating abandoned commercial spaces across the city, transforming them 
into temporary artistic havens. By taking charge of these dilapidated, 
downtown spaces, the groups are using the city's crippled economy to 
improve their culture. From the ruins of the economic slump, they are 
sculpting an artistic climate. 

Sixty Orange Street is one such gallery. Two years ago, French 
scoured the Ninth Square's vacant storefronts, hunting for a place for 
his penguins and other artists' works. He asked a real-estate agent a few 
doors down for permission -to display a few sculptures. The agent 
immediately allowed the group to use the vacant building. "The thing 
is, the place is really for rent, and if someone comes in and wants to 
sign a lease for five years to make a restaurant or something and they're 
willing to shell out a couple thousand, then we're out," French explains. 
"So we've got a sort of sweetheart deal at this point in time, as we're not 
paying thousands of dollars. We're just making the place look habit-
able." 

Two years before French even set out on his artistic mission, when 
the economic and artistic climate was at a low point, an organization 
had already emerged with the sole goal of promoting the arts. ArtSpace, 
a non-profit organizaion, is committed to improving the art commu-
nity by finding outlets for local artists to display their work. The orga-
nization is best known for its beautiful converted gallery space on · 
Orange Street, but at any one time the gallery displays work in a dozen 
spaces across town. Helen Kauder, the foundation's director, is contin-
u_ally seeking abandoned buildings to convert to galleries. 

"I'm not really sure why there are all these vacant storefronts," 
Kauder muses. "The businesses just sort ofdied." She notes that spaces 
are becoming . more and more difficult to find.· "Due to the overall 
development in New Haven ... we're having to look deeper into resi-
dential neighborhoods ... The early nineties were a tough time and a lot 
of alternative and commercial galleries folded. When we started in 
1998, we grew from this need to display work from the artist's per-
. " 
specnve. 

The process of converting an abandoned · commercial space into a 
gallery is, of course, no simple feat. "You need to make an appointment 
with the city, and that in itself can be hectic - they're busy with other 
things, and [appointments] needs to be booked far in advance. And 
then you need to pass inspections with a fue marshal ... The work we 
do embodies general cleaning up, cleaning windows, making signs, 
putting in lighting and sometimes building new walls," Kauder 
explains. The group once converted spaces that are now day care cen-
ters, bookshops, Chinese Take-out restaurants, and even a hair salon. 
Displays that are affiliated with ArtSpace have also occupied places like 
the Gourmet Heaven space on Whitney and Audubon Streets, as well 
as Book Trader Cafe. The construction on Chapel and Orange, soon to 
be Cutler's Corner, was once the American Discount Store on 852 
Chapel Street, but even before its aisles were studded with mouthwash 
and diapers, it housed the elegant works of local artists.

Currently, the gallery collective is involved in a display that opens 
on April 18, in another empty Ninth Square street front across from 
their current location at 50 Orange Street. The show, "Treasure Maps," 
is a collection of art by non-artists: mathematicians, dancers, and biol-
ogists. ArtSpace, unlike the conventional New Haven Paint and Clay 
Oub and the conservative Society of Connecticut Sculptors, seeks to 
display the avant-garde and the cutting edge. "The work we try to show 
is not typical. We are trying to encourage artists to show non-tradi-
tional art, to work together and make site-specific works, and most of 
all we're trying to create a dialogue between the artists," says Kauder. 

ArtSpace is also responsible for the well-known City Wide Open 
Studios, an annual project that brings together about four hundred 
artists and displays their work in a larger, ~bandoned industrialized 
space. The success of City Wide Open Studios has encouraged many 
artists, including Kauder, to seek out permanent non-conventional 
spaces. In fact, marty artists who met at City Wide Open Studios have 
banded together to found their own galleries. 

In 1999., ArtSpace acquired the rights to an empty office building 
at 99 Orange Street. The gallery then transferred control of the space 
to a 
group of artists, including Stephen Grossman, who became-specifically 
interested in one of the building's dilapidated second floor walls. 
Instead of using the open space to display his already extensive body of 
work, Grossman opted to create a site-specific piece. He marked the 
wall with a series of vertical stripes and painted between the stripes a 
fade of light washes that, though largely abstract, implied atmospheric 
spatial depth. Painted over the crumbling surface, Grossman's piece 
revealed the wall's history, highlighting its weighty pa.St. Rather than 
seeking to cover up a piece of failure and destruction, the work accen-
tuates its dilapidation, suggesting the beauty he found in ruin. 

This work, entitled "Collaboration with a Wall," was featured in 
Art News, one of the art world's most widely distributed and respected

Across the Green, guarding the intersection of Whitney and 
Audubon streets, the former residence of Clinton Pianos has been 
cleared of musical instruments. A "University Properties" sign hangs 
in the front window, advertising the space to interested landlords. But 
here, nestled beneath the crown moldings of imitation living rooms 
and hovering over the wall-to-wall carpeting once ridden by a sea of 
lacquered pianos, hangs the work of yet another collective of hopeful 
painters, the Elm City Artists. 

The Elm City Artists "grew out of friendship," explains founding 
member John Cooney. "We would get together at a local bar after a 
Friday open studio class and talk about art." And while the group has 
pulled together an impressive show, they aren't really reaching for the 
pages of Art News. "Though I suppose," Cooney admits, "some of us 
might harbor the secret desire to be successful." Although their first 
full group show is receiving much less publicity than Grossman's did, 
it is no small accomplishment. "There are about 180 paintings here," 
Cooney says proudly, "And we've sold about forty." Mr. Cooney is not

the typical gallery guide. In a plaid shirt and jeans, he sits expectantly 
behind a desk stacked with fliers. When a shy blonde asks if she can 
come in and just look at the paintings, or if she has to pay, he's ecstat-
ic. "By all means, come on in," he says, waving her inside. 

When Cooney leads a visitor around the gallery, he's surprised by 
a painting; "Look - one of peas!" he says, excitedly, "I didn't see that 
one before." The painting at which he's pointing is not something you 
would find in the classical floors of the Yale Galleries- it's-a simple snap 
pea, rudely rendered against a lemon yellow backdrop. It's a terrible 
painting, but at the same time, there's something homey and kind 
about the work, and Cooney evidently loves it. A few days later, the 
painting has been moved from the backroom to the front window, 
where it can face the whole city, and maybe draw the attention of the 
next passerby to a storefront which would other-
wise be empty. But when the next aspiring entre-
preneur rents the space, the artists will take down 
their work, forced to find another hole in the fab-
ric of New Haven to patch with their migratory 
art.
