A case in point is the career arc of
Professor Seyla Benhabib, who is currently
the director of the Ethics, Politics, and
Economics Department and a full tenured
professor. She was an assistant professor at
Yale for two years after graduating from the
Ph.D. program in Philosophy, then she left to
take a research fellowship in Germany. Upon
returning to America, she taught at Boston
and Harvard Universities for two years without
tenure. She was then tenured at SUNY
'
Stony brook, which led' to tenure at Harvard
in 1993 and eventually, in 2001, back at Yale.
In this case, the university was able to bring
her talent back to the
institution after her early
promise of excellence
came to fruition.
Yet while this system
benefits the goals of the
insitution, it is a grueling
process for the scholars
who seek job security.
The university runs on
the bottom line and cannot
make promises even
to its high-level employ-
ees, the professors. Many
junior faculty come to
Yale and leave frustrated.
Yale rarely hires within
t4e r~ks, a policy which
sets up a "glass ceiling"
for its junior professors.
fter five years of
teaching
and
research, Professor
·
Guillermo Irizarry is also
leaving Yale this spring.
He says that the amount
of research work expected of junior faculty is
an enormous burden. In order to get tenure at
any institution of higher learning in America,
an academic in the humanities needs to have
one book under his or her belt and another
near completion, as well as a sizable dossier of
academic papers published in respected journals. All this must be accomplished within
the four or five years before his or her case
goes up for review by a tenure committee. "It
means you don't have a life," Professor
Irizarry jokes painfully. At Ivy League institutions, "You not only have to walk on water,
but you need someone in your department to
argue.for and defend your work," he says.
Yale hires assistant professors for five to
•
six year contracts, at which point promotion
to associate professor depends on an assessment. But unlike many state universities, Yale
does not offer associate professors tenure.
Instead it considers them mere junior faculty.
Only after a faculty member has taught for at
least ten years is he or she eligible to be hired
as a full tenured professor.
When a department committee decides to
grant a faculty member full professorship, the
decision is immense and political, as it entails
an investment of several million .dollars over
· the course of twenty to twenty-five years.

Drafting these senior faculty lines, or full professors tenure tracks, is extremely difficult. As
a result, academics who study marginal topics
can face long odds in seeking tenure. "For
example," Irizarry says amiably, "we are in the
Literature Department, and we are all senior
faculty deciding whether to give a certain
junior faculty member tenure. They are the
absolute expert in the literature of a remote
island in the Caribbean, but it doesn't have .
much to do with your area of expertise, or ·
mine. It's not a particularly hot topic . . Why
should we create a tenure line for him? Unless
someone argues passionately for his case." On
this point, Cooppan agrees. In her view, this
trend of conventionality is hostile to the
innovative, cutting edge scholarship of many
brilliant young academics. Such was the case
for Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Currently a leading
scholar in African American Studies and a
tenured professor at Harvard, he was once a
junior professor at Yale. Untenured here, he
left to teach at Cornell University.


Early cases of tenure, where junior faculty
members are actually promoted, make up
only a small percentage of Yale's tenure
appointments each year. The dominant practice by far, he explains, is to hire academics
who are "at the high point in their careers,
with established reputations." This is common knowledge to junior faculty like him
and Cooppan, who chose to leave for more
advanced, secure positions at other universities even before
being reviewed by
Yale's initial pro-
motion committee.
To Cooppan,
it is not only one
of job security.
"Much of what I
want to do, I can
do better elsewhere," she says.
In addition to creating
courses, she
works with cultural
houses as a minority professor and participates
in
the
Women's Faculty
Forum.
But
instead of being
satisfied with her
engagement, she
feels spread thin.
"I'm at a stage in
my work where I
want to
invest
energy in an institution and have it recognize
that work from the beginning." For Yale
junior faculty, there is "no indication that
someone has invested in us for the. long haul,
- and we can only learn the lesson of our transience." A particular disappointment for her,
having been a Yale undergraduate herself, was
that the university does not value its faculty
the way it does its students. "When you're an
undergrad, it really is all about you. When
you're a graduate student, or a,junior professor, that's no longer the case. And that's kind
of sad .... you're told to keep your head down
and get your work done. Yale can't keep banking on drawing people who choose, perhaps
foolhardily, not to keep their heads down."
Another strong draw of the UC system,
where she will teach this fall is its "family
friendly initiative." As the mother of two
young children, Cooppan appreciates the five
year leave that UC offers. The UC system
also actively encourages the increase of
female faculty by providing ·comprehensive
day care.


Recently, the Women's Faculty Forum
(WFF), of which Vilashini and Seyla are members, has pushed for greater understanding
of the woman's role in academia. "There is
a price one pays as a woman," she told me.
"It is the most difficult between the ages of
thirty and forty, with the biological clock
ticking. And at the same time, from thirty-
five to thirty-eight, that's when one comes up
for tenure." Benhabib, however, emphasized
the need for hard statistics before drawing
conclusions. The WFF is currently creating a
task-force to gather data on women at Yale.
In her opinion, an institution of higher learning can only gain by eradicating needless
obstacles for women. "As the director of EP
& E," she said, "it is increasingly difficult to
find someone to serve as the director of
undergraduate studies, because it is regarded
as a dead-end administrative job by most
junior faculty, especially the men. Women
are generally
better
citizens.
Her
conclusion
is
that
many
more
women
junior
faculty
volunteer
for these
tasks,
many of
which the
university
does not
reward.
"Yale
tenure
from within the ranks," she criticizes. "There
needs to be discussion at the very top administrative levels: are there aspects of the tenuring procedure that are not working? Is the
current procedure accomplishing the tasks it's
designed for? The fact is that we're having our
best junior faculty stolen, and we're wasting
time
resources hiring new people over and
over.
faculty have
reason to be
hopeful. "At
least there is
a
now,
forum,"
she
says in reference
to the
WFF.
"The
institution
still does not
make it easy
to be a junior
faculty member
here, but
at least there
is a place to
discuss these
questions.


Vilashini Cooppan and her two kids


One has to
start the discussion." Cooppan, for her part,
notes that one of the problems with initiatives
like the
WFF is
that they
rely
on
and students, all
of whom
cycle
through
Yale and
leave
within
four
to
ten years.
Powerful
thrusts
from the
grassroots
level run
out
of
steam
after only a few years, and responsibility falls
to the next cycle of leaders to continually
push for negotiations. "At a point," she predicts, "it will be too costly for Yale to keep
cycling in this way."
Irizarry believes that the university has an
ultimately hierarchical culture, one reluctant
to give support to those
low on the ladder. "I don't
want to imply that this is a
plot to oppress junior faculty,
because it's not. Yale
isn't stingy, but it is interested in having the best,
now. It can outpay most
other universities for their
senior faculty, and can
even make pre-emptive
offers. . . Let them leave,
then let them come back
when they prove themselves. That is Yale's general
attitude."
Will Professors Irizarry
and Cooppan be back at
Yale as senior faculty ten
years from now? As far as
Yale is concerned, the
jury's still out. And for current
undergrads who
aspire to professorship, it's
unclear whether the path
ahead will be easier going
even walking in
their formidable footsteps.
