**Title: Tweed New Haven Regional Airport: A SimCity Approach to Air Travel**
**Author: Romy Drucker**
**Page number(s): 38**

The automatic sliding glass doors that 
lead to the main ' and only terminal 
ofTweed New Haven Regional Airport 
bear an ironically ferocious warning in bold 
red letters: STAND )3ACK. 

Though the 
maxim is certainly a necessary safety feature 
for the temperamental doors, the admonition 
seems applicable to the whole airport, not just 
its entrance. You do want to .. stand back" as 
you gaze inside Tweed, with its industrial 
brushstrokes of red and 
grey on the walls and 
floors. 

The airport's 
color scheme and the 
sheer absurdity of its petite 
frame make the building 
seem like it was meticulously 
fit together. from a few pieces of a Lego Set. 
You want to stand back from Tweed. Stand 
back and laugh. 

"Tweed is a farm," as one Pierson sopho-
more who recently visited the airport put 
it. The airport sort of jumps out of 
nowhere, as if it were placed 
with all the thought that goes 
into a left mouse click in the residential zone 
of a game of SimCity. Compared to New 
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, 
which is over 4,930 acres .and boasts three 
enormous runways which range from 10,000 
to 14,572 feet in length, Tweed is 236 acres 
and has one runway which measures a measly 
5600 feet. Even as far as small airports go, 
Tweed is positively dinky. To get there you 
take modest residential side streets with 
names evocative of suburbia's pleasant green-
ery: Grove Street, Forest Street and Charter 
Oak Avenue. These are streets that normal-
ly take you to the grocery store or the clean-
ers, not to an airport. The route is marked by 
blue informational signs stamped with an air-
plane logo, which looks more like a slightly 
disfigured bird than a plane. Runways aside, 
the building itself might be smaller than a 
Connecticut bird sanctuary. This is a place 
where planes depart and arrive, but some 
Connecticut homes definitely show it up. Of 
course, most homes do not have baggage 
carousels (Tweed doesn't actUally have a real 
baggage carousel), or what seems to be 
Twec;!d's greatest asset: a colorful and plenti-
fully stocked Snapple vending machine.  

On a Saturday afternoon during the 
Connecticut public school spring break,Â· the 
only people in the lonely terminal were two 
idle uniformed workers manning the vacan_t 
ticket counter. The blankness of their expres-
sions suggested that thes~ employees were 
used to slow days. Currently, the only flights 
from Tweed go to Philadelphia. Who from 
New Haven needs to go to Philadelphia 
anyway? 

Apparently, 
corporate 
America. "We need an 
airport 
that 
can 
serve the cor-
porate com-
munity that needs to get in ... Get their busi-
ness done ... And get out and Tweed New 
Haven 
really 
has 
that," 
said 
Henry 
Fernandez, Economic Director of the City of 
New Haven in an aviation press release. And 
maybe this little airport really is needed: there 
were several dozen cars parked in Tweed's 
Long Term parking lot that day and even 
some empty spots at the attached Avis rental 
car facility. With the recent acquisition of 
Delta shuttle service and forthcoming flights 
to Washington-Dulles Airport from a nou-
veau airline called Independent, more people 
are warming up to the possibility of a New 
Haven airport, even if it does look like a joke 
from the outside. 

The project sparked a city-wide debate 
this year when additional money was 
required to expedite the renovations which 
Tweed has been undergoing almost continu-
ously since it opened in 1931. Naysayers dis-
missed this desperate final attempt to mod-
ernize Tweed as part of an 
n realistically 
utopian economic vision of New Haven. So 
when the city's generous contract with Tweed 
expired and technically ended funding 
efforts, no one expected Mayor John 
DeStefano to independently decide that if the 
New Haven business community could raise 
two million dollais, the city would commit 
another $900,000. "Given that we had laid 
off public service employees and raised taxes," 
said Ward One Alderman Ben Healey, "it 
seemed difficult to justify putting $900,000 
towards an airport." 

But eventually, after 
heated debates within the aldermanic cham-
ber, Healey came to support the airport. 
"There are no sure bets when it comes to 
something like Tweed Airport," he admitted .. 
But the prospect of economic development 
gave 
him 
reason 
enough to try and con-
vince fellow officials 
and 
skeptical 
con-
stituents of his opinion: 
"You've gotta give it a chance." 

Expanding Tweed is a gamble for 
New Haven, much in the same way 
that New Haven gambled on an exten-
sive urban development project in the 1950s: 
parking lots. Despite an extensive highway 
infrastructure, for the most part, those stayed 
empty. Will Tweed take off? Will those lone-
ly employees realize their vision of a terminal 
bustling with business associates hurriedly 
trying to catch a plane back to their home 
bases and Yale students traveling home on the 
holidays? Will Tweed's baggage carousels 
make their first substantial circuit? (Tweed 
doesn't acwally have baggage carousels.) Will 
Snapples tumble forth from the machine as 
quickly as they are snatched from a Yale Law 
School refrigerator? One can only hope that 
for the good of the New Haven community, 
those answers will all be, "Go fly."
