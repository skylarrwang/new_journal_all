bout twenty years ago, Frank Gehry designed the Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital, which occupies a small triangular block bounded by Liberty Street, Washington Avenue, and Congress Avenue, at the southern edge of the Yale-New Haven Medical Center. 
The stairwells are partially exposed to the elements and a small moat lines one corner of the Hospital complex's lead exterior, which is both toxic and unsafe to touch. Each day, at the entrance on Liberty Street, the mentally ill of Yale and New Haven arrive to be treated, with or without their consent.

Last spring, Flora*, a sophomore, became severely depressed. 
On a night, she said something to a friend along the lines of, "Maybe I should just take all my pills." She doesn't remember her exact words most of that weekend has become a haze. The friend took her to the emergency staff at University Health Services (UHS), which decided, against Flora's will, that she needed to go to "the Hospital" (as she calls it and as it will be referred to herein). 
The ambulance crew strapped her on a stretcher the first of several experiences she now describes as "dehumanizing" and rushed her to the suicidal unit at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. There, after waiting seven hours for a bed to become available, she was again put on a stretcher and wheeled to the adult psychiatric ward. 

Another patient, Michael, has less traumatic memories of entering "the Hospital." 
Sometime in October, after a "pretty terrible weekend depression-wise," Michael's psychiatrist recommended a visit at the end of his regular mental hygiene appointment. At first Michael resisted, but the doctor assured him he "would be there just for a few days. It just going to be a chance to rest and recu-u ... " 
He consented, and about an hour later, an ambulance arrived to take him to the Hospital. He remembered the ambulance being "a little too chipper ... but one was a woman with a heavily hair-sprayed fe-mul-e-a e's a e-a e's let, and that's worth mentioning." 

Although Michael consented to go to the Hospital, if his doctor had declared his case an emergency, Michael's opinion, like Flora's, would not have mattered. Dr. Sledge, Medical Director of the Hospital and Master of Calhoun College, estimates that one quarter of the Hospital's admitted patients are "truly involuntary," but that after about a week, most end up changing their minds. 
Still, there are those, like Flora, who do not change their minds. For them, their forced hospitalization makes them feel that their mental health has slipped out of their control. 
For Michael, this loss of control became apparent when he learned that a doctor he had just met for a few minutes that morning had called his mother and asked her to come to the hospital. "Had my therapist or psychiatrist, or even [my dean] called her, they would have known that my mother herself attempted suicide a little over a month prior," he recalled later. "-My relationship with her is tenuous, and her presence was not comforting to me at the time." The phone call from UHS was the first time Flora's parents had heard that their daughter had mental health problems. In high school, Flora never told anyone she was depressed: "I never talked about being depressed to my guid~ counselor, because I thought she would give me a bad recommendation and I wouldn't get into college." Her parents had to drive to New Haven and stay in the Ronald McDonald House, a discount residence for families of the hospitalized. 

Both Flora and Michael are ex-residents of WS2, the adult ward at the Hospital. Dr. Sledge explains, "WS2 means the operations that are on the second floor of the Washington Square building," which is named for the adjacent street (as are the complex's other two buildings, Liberty Village and Congress Place). 

Sarah, a junior who also had a severe depressive episode, arrived at WS2 just hours before Michael. On the day of their arrival, the ward was decorated with cutout pumpkins illustrated with faces patients had drawn during a session of occupational therapy. Ghosts adorned the nurse's station, a big glass box overlooking the lounge. "I looked at the nurse's station and immediately thought: 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'" Sarah said. On the corkboard in her room, someone had written a dialogue with Jesus. "Forgive me Jesus for my evil, evil sins," it read, and then beneath that: "I forgive you I watch over everyone in this room. Remember the Ten Commandments love thy father and mother." The word "remember" was underlined twice. 

Sarah shared her quad with three older women. WS2 does not separate Yale students from New Haven residents, nor does it separate those with mood disorders, like depression or bipolar disorder, from those with other illnesses, like schizophrenia, which a number of students complained about. "One 83-year-old woman wouldn't stop talking when it was time to go to sleep," said Sarah. "She'd just say, 'Get me out of here, please God get me out of here.'" The first night, a patient with Tourette's syndrome sat outside her room cursing repeatedly. "He was like a leaky faucet just saying 'Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.'" 

In the hospital, the day begins early. 
"You have to get up at the ass crack of dawn," said Flora. The first activity is "Goals Group," a group session during which each patient, in turn, declares his or her goal for the day. "Everyone said their goal was to get out that day. One guy was deaf. He would just scream," Flora remembered. 

All patients are assigned a treatment team that includes a nurse, a doctor, a social worker, and some medical students, since Yale-New Haven is a teaching hospital. 

Flora said that the Hospital was not helpful: "You just sit around for eight fucking hours thinking about how depressed you are." Dr. Robert Milstein, Associate Medical Director, said that while life in the ward is certainly "not exciting in the sense that everyday life is," there are still activities and various treatments over the course of the day. 
There are outdoor breaks, there are puzzles and board games, and there is a television. 
And there is also occupational therapy, otherwise known as arts and crafts. One day during her two-week stay at the hospital, Sarah's art therapist told the group to draw how they were feeling. "I drew a brick wall and a tornado chasing a little guy," she told me. "And I drew a knot." 

The history of the Yale-New Haven Psychiatric Hospital reflects the history of psychiatric care through the past century. 
Until recently it was called the Yale Psychiatric Institute (YPI), established by the Yale Medical School in the 1930s. 
Throughout the following decades, the YPI used a psychoanalytic approach, specializing in adolescent and young adult treatment. 
The method common in these decades was known as "rehabilitative." The setting was "more like home," says Dr. Sledge, and those who could afford it came from all over the world to the YPI. 

In the 1960s a strong anti-institutional sentiment swept across much of the nation, and many psychological hospitals and homes were emptied. But this first wave of de-institutionalization was ill-conceived, since few outpatient resources were well-developed. A second wave of de-institutionalization over the next two decades was more successful, although it was followed by a sharp rise in the costs of both inpatient and outpatient mental health care. Insurance companies began pressuring patients not to stay long in mental hospitals. "Today," Dr. Sledge told me, "those who pay the bills have said, 'We are not paying for rehabilitation we pay for the treatment of acute symptoms.'" Because of this pressure, the average stay at today's psychiatric hospital is only eight or nine days. 

Due to this drop in financing, the YPI began to accumulate debts. Meanwhile, the neighboring Yale-New Haven Hospital has always had its own mental health service. In 2000, Yale Medicine Magazine ran a blurb headed "FALL TO YPI," calling the Institute "a victim of the new economics of healthcare." The Yale-New Haven Hospital would acquire the old facility under Dr. Sledge's direction, improving both their own mental health services and those of the Institute since "Yale-New Haven Hospital has more access to patients through its medical services and can participate in federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid more fully than a free-standing psychiatric hospital." 

The shift in payments from insurance companies, which led to a shift in the standard of care, may be one of the factors that provoked criticisms of the psychiatric hospital. As Dr. Sledge pointed out, the old "rehabilitative" system was more lenient toward the patients but ultimately unsustainable due to the expense. The cost of weeks or months of nursing and doctoring was too expensive for the majority, and thus the system was "not democratic, in that only the very wealthy, and the very well-insured could afford treatment." 
The new system, then, was democratic, because it was cheaper but it became cheaper at a price. 

When you have suicidal thoughts, Flora said, "you don't really want to die. You just want something inside you to die." 
Though she told the emergency staff at UHS that she wanted to sleep for a very long time, it was because she wanted relief from her depression. Flora wanted the rehabilitation she had thus far failed to get, not just the treatment of acute symptoms, so she was determined to get out of the Hospital from the moment she set foot inside. For her, WS2 was "really demoralizing. It made me feel like I couldn't take care of myself. And they didn't change my medications, they didn't really give me therapy." 

The weekend of her arrival at the Hospital, Flora talked with two other Yale students who would soon be let out after a week and a half stay. The students had just learned that Yale was asking them to take a medical leave from school. The two girls advised Flora to be careful about what she told her doctors, if she wanted to be able to stay at Yale. 

A student often becomes a patient at the Hospital before he even learns that his status at Yale is in jeopardy and hinges on approval from two doctors at Mental Hygiene, Dr. Lorraine Siggins and Dr. Eric Millman. They decide whether a student is allowed to return to classes or if he will have to take medical leave. 

The two girls whom Flora befriended in the Hospital gave her advice on how to portray herself to those evaluating her. "They said if I let them know that school's a problem, they'd kick me out. So, basically, I was very manipulative with my doctors." 

Dr. Sledge tried to sketch the different viewpoints surrounding the doctors' decisions to hospitalize and to subsequently force medical leave. Patients generally "don't want to think of themselves as profoundly mentally ill," and thus will sometimes deny the seriousness of their situations. Certain conditions can also distort patients' perspectives: the manic patients tend to have extreme denial, the paranoid ones have misperceptions, and the depressed ones have feelings of doom and self-blame. Those responsible for taking care of such patients must be careful to make their own judgments accordingly. "There will be disagreements between clinicians and patients about what the truth is and sometimes [the patients are] right," Dr. Sledge said. 

A little under a week after entering the Hospital, Michael met with Dr. Millman, who told him, without missing a beat, that he would not be going back to school but would be sent home. Michael protested, as did his mother and even his college dean. The doctor agreed to confer with the rest of the team and reconsider, but they stuck with their initial decision. "I was really angry and upset for a good two months after," Michael wrote me. The doctors "did confer with both my therapist and psychiatrist, and Dr. Milstein and [the social worker] at the hospital, but it still seems wrong. The decision rested upon the whim of two people I spent less than an hour
