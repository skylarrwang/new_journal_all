How to Write a Political Poem 
By Taylor Mali 
However it begins, it's gotta be loud 
and then it's gotta get a little bit louder. 
Because this is how you write a political 
poem 
and how you deliver it with power ... - -
... Because all you have to do is close 
your eyes, 
lower your voice, and end by saying: 
the same line three times, 
the same line three times. 
Mali's criticism of hip-hop inspired 
poetry takes the form of satirical mimicry of 
the genre, light-hearted and astute on many 
points, but all the more painful to watch 
when delivered by a white, middle-aged man, 
particularly as he attempts to beat-box, grunt, 
and imitate the distinctive slang of hip-hop 
vernacular. The audience is visually uncom-
fortable at best, and the silence conveys a hazy 
disapproval at the breaking of a cultural 
taboo. 
Somebody in the back wonders if he is 
holding anything back, if Mr. Mali is censor-
ing himself for this group of Yale students. 
"Mr. Mali, is there any material you specifi-
cally wouldn't perform for a group of Yale 
students like us?" someone asks. ''Actually, 
the one I just did has gotten me in the most 
trouble," he replies, ''And I wouldn't have 
performed it here if you hadn't brought up 
hip-hop."
