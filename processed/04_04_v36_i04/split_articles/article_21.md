remember saying yes, oh yes, this is a job 
I've wanted since I was seventeen years 
old," says Professor Vilashni Coop pan. 
That was six years ago, when she landed her 
first job: Assistant Professor of Literature at 
Yale University, her alma mater. "It was an 
incredible sense of arrival," she says. But at 
the end of this semester, she will leave her 
post at Yale to teach in the University of 
California system. "I think I speak for many," 
she said in a recent speech to the Women's 
Faculty Forum, "when I say that we want our 
dream jobs to deliver more than this. We 
Â· want to work somewhere where we matter 
and where we count." 

Cooppan always knew this day would 
come 
Yale had made that clear. "The insti-
tution leaves no room for surprise," she 
exp]ains. "They let you know that there is less 
than ten percent tenure rate for junior facul-
ty. You choose to come here knowing that." 
Yale's tenure positions usually go to acade-
mics who are already leaders in their fields 
and perhaps tenured elsewhere. To Cooppan, 
this tendency means that contributions she 
might make to the Yale comniunity, includ-
ing mentoring students and cooperating 
with colleagues to develop academic innova-
tions, will go unappreciated. "All of it is on 
your own time," she says. "I have been told, 
as have all my junior colleagues, that 'You 
should have said 'no' to whatever extra 
demands, courses, committees, program-
building initiatives, curriculum redesign 
projects, interdisciplinary seminars, etc. are 
placed on us and have gotten in the way of 
our 'real work.'" 

World Literatures, a course that Professor 
Cooppan designed from scratch, is an exam-
ple of a contribution she feels is underappre-
ciated. Since the course's inception, it has 
become a core requirement for the Literature 
major and has received rave reviews from stu-
dents. She smiles, "it was a pedagogical pro-
ject that led to some of the best 
I 
have done here and served as the basis for sev-
eral solid articles. The work that the institu-
tion considers peripheral irrigates the 'real 
work' 
the work that matters." 

tis common knowledge that Yale has high 
standards for its faculty, and emphasizes 
~e importance of research. In a recent 
article on the tenure process in The Yale 
Herald, History Department Chair Jon 
Butler is quoted as saying: "The University is 
committed to the advancement of knowl-
edge. And the advancement of knowledge 
comes from scholarship 
from research, as 
opposed to te;~ching." To achieve his goal, 
Yale hires only the best of the best: those who 
publish the most influential and respected 
books and papers in humanities, and those 
responsible for leading research in the sci-
ences. From the their perspective, it pays to 
make long term investments only in academ-
ic super stars. Such investments leave Yale's 
young professors fending for themselves in 
the shadows of their world-renowned col-
leagues. If, later in their careers, these junior 
faculty prove to be top scholars themselves, 
Yale can then give them atuactive tenure
