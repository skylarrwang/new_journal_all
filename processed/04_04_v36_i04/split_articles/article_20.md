had a primarily retail portfolio, Nyberg is primarily a residential devel-
oper. Some of his best-known local projects include the apartments 
above the Palace Theatre and the properties on College Street. "I was 
intrigued by the idea of housing; the notion of turning the office build-
ing into housing seemed to be a promising and interesting one," said 
Garvin. "It was the first scheme that thought about downtown resi-
dential use." 

Still the current plan is not universally praised. According to neigh-
bors, it is being organized without ·a grand plan for design; no architect 
is listed on the forms filed with the city for zoning changes. While the 
previous plan had centered on changing the very fabric of the mall-
turning it "inside out" and cutting through to extend the Shubert 
Arcade through the building the current design will keep the mall's 
basic design intact. If the previous proposal was open-heart surgery, this 
is a mere band-aid. Healey sees this as a problem. "The second story on 
the Temple and Chapel corner is a office space for [Nyberg's] purpos-
es," he said. The concrete shell is not much different. What is needed 
is strong architectural vision. If there is one on the project, he's being 
paid to work from the inside out rather than the outside in." Even 
without a strong design vision, the building has already opened doors 
and laid out a welcome mat.

Chapel Street. While her warmth may seem a bit premature, 
there will certainly be something new to see when students 
return to New Haven in the fall. The fourth development will mark the 
end of four decades of hope for a downtown mall. The resulting buiJd-
ing will be much like other city apartments, with housing above and 
retail units on the ground floor. What will not return is the airy inner 
atrium, the floors of retail and the very idea that spawned American 
mall growth: enclosed, climate-controlled space. If the new plan suc-
ceeds, it will mark the first time that Chapel Square has achieved eco-
nomic success. According to Douglas Rae, Yale Professor of 
Management and Political Science and author of City, a recent book 
on urbanization in New Haven, "I do think there is potential, and that 
the right development of the mall will meet with market success." But 
for now the building is dark, empty and waiting 
an island in a city 
watching it for signs of movement.
