Democratic Town 
Committee Chair

got advance 
warning of what to expect-as a result of the 
previous evening's turnout and have managed 
to improvise an agenda with aplomb. The 
attendees have to maneuver around us as they 
line up to donate money to nominee's cause 
and sign up for the lists of activities. 

To Voigt, the free-form structure and 
energy that characterize Meetups seem both 
mysterious and intriguing. "This is all so new 
and different to me. I'm used to ;mion poli-
tics, where there's a structure, and everyone 
knows exactly what they're supposed to do. 
But we need to learn to do this, to put some 
more life into the Party, and to use these new 
ideas and technologies to reach different con-

says earnestly. "We even got Mayor John

sign that Meetup has broken into the con-
sciousness of the Democratic establishment

Rosenberg intends to lat~h onto that 
opening and harness the enthusiasm of the 
Clark and Dean Meetup groups to energize 
the local Democratic Party. "There are 
130,000 people in N~ Haven and only 
50,000 are registered Democrats. This is 
unacceptable," she says. As the city regularly 
polls oover half Democratic, Rosenberg has a 
rea~on to expect more. On the other hand, 
this dominance is itself a reason for apathy. 
With such a powerfUl Democratic machine 
ensuring victory at almost all levels of govern-
ment in election after election, it's nnsurpris-
ing that few people see much reason to regis-
ter and vote. Although the Kerry campaign 
hopes to build the anarchic energy of the 
Clark and Dean Meetups into a potent anti-
Bush force. Laura Barnes, a Clark supporter 
from Lyme, is skeptical: "We grew from with-
in, from early meetings and increasing online 
organization and they worked. The Kerry 
people are trying to get into this sideways, 
and I'm not sure 
that they fit."

**Hearing History**
**Author: Julian Darwalt**

Looking for the 
office of Andy 
Horowitz, director of the New Haven Oral 
History Project, in the basement of HGS, I 
take a wrong turn down the dim orange hall 
7


and wind up walled in by a decayed mattress 
and a pile of discarded desks. Though Andy 
says that he is ashamed to lead donors to his 
office, the project has recently attracted sig~ 
nificant 
donations. The energetic office 
makes up for the modest surroundings. From 
the recorders on Andy's desk to the stacks of 
CDs with the stories ofNew Haven residents, 
one senses that something historically signifi-
cant is in the works here. 

Andy launches into the history of his 
own project and its connection with urban 
renewal. He sees a great . logic to the 
NHOHP: it fills a historically important gap 
in the extensive literature on New Haven's 
renewal, it is educational for the interviewers 
(some of whom are doing simultaneous indi~ 
vidual research), and it helps foster a town-
gown dynamic that is empowering for New 
Haven citizens. 

He gives me a quick history of New 
Haven renewal, beginning with historians' 
traditional starting point 
Richard Lee, 
mayor of New Haven from 1954:-1970. 
During that time Lee created radical change 
in the city with extremely well-funded pro-
jects that attracted national attention. At one 
point, New Haven was receiving twice as 
much from. the government as any other city 
iri America. But while he put New Haven at · 
the forefront of American urban renewal pro-
jects, his policies remain controversial. He 
relocated over 25,000 people to create his 
conception of "the model city." In the 
process, he erased much of what was deemed 
unsightly in New Haven, but some would 
argue that in the process he also got rid of 
much of what was good. 

Pointing to a . 
framed magazine page OIJ. his wall, Andy 
shows 
me 
several 
Caterpillar 
Heavy 
Equipment magazine advertisements depicting-
ing Richard Lee in command of a fleet of 
bulldozers ploughing through New Haven. 

Previously, historians have examined 
how Lee set up alternative government struc-
tures, how he secured his massive amounts of 
funding, and how he achieved such large scale 
change. 

From historians like Yale professor 
Douglas Rae, we know a good deal about a 
small number of the people who governed 
New Haven. But, Andy explains, we know 
very little about what the actual experience 
was like for most residents: "No one," Andy 
says, "has ever asked what was it like to live in 
the model city." One of the main goals of 
oral history is to record the stories of those 
people who are not represented in the tradi-
tional historical record. Andy is a firm believ-
8 
er in the notion that "You don't have to be 
famous for your life to be history." And this 
community-based approach, he says, is part 
of what has made the project so successful; 
people want to do it, and they are aware that 
they are helping write history themselves .. 

In Andy's opinion the very act of inter-
viewing is just as valuable as the archives it 
produces. While Andy thinks the typical 
range of Yale service projects is fantastic, he 
noticed that after a while the dynamic can get 
a little one-sided 
Yale students are the 
experts helping out New Haven. With the 
oral history project, New Haven residents are 
helping out students, and the interviews· are 
empowering for both sides, Growing up in 
New Haven, Andy says pointedly, "my par-
ents and friends were smart, too." 

About half way through our talk, a mem-
ber of his team comes in. She has just inter-
viewed a resident for a research paper. "His 
dog burped into the microphone," she says. 
"Yeah, that happened to me .too one time," 
replies Andy. 

How did Andy begin the project in 
which he would later have experience with 
dog-burp archival? Andy is a New Haven res-
ident who went to Hillhouse High School. 
For four summers he worked for the 
Department of Weights and Measures. He 
was the guy who went .around making sure 
· everybody got a fair deal on their cheese at 
the deli by standardizing scales. "When you 
are doing a job like that," he admits, "you 
take your time." So he heard all sorts of inter-
esting stories. As for the cheese scale accura-
cy, he says, the benefit usually went to the 
customers: "the scales get sticky after a while 
which makes things read as heavier." Andy 
offers that detail with a certain self-aware 
excitement, his inner archivist grinning at the 
idea.that he has had firsthand access to such a 
quirky fact. 

What else has Andy found? Some stories 
are bits of New Haven color: the owner of the 
Winchester factory used to ride his bike up a 
hill holding onto the back of a trolley. Others 
probe the high hopes and tough conse-
quences of renewal. A planner of the 
Audobon arts district describes the period as 
"one of the most exciting times; there was the 
sense that you could dream as big as you 
wanted and the city and the federal govern-
ment could have it there for you to make it 
happen." A man tells how, when his child-
hood neighborhood was bulldozed, he would 
take the after school bus with his friends to 
stand around the remains of their old neigh-
borhood. Another resident describes how her 
family had owned a store for three genera-
tions 
a store that "is now under 1-91. They 
built a highway over my livelihood." There 
are also stories of integration; one interviewee 
was a lawyer for a group dedicated to inte-
grating predominantly white neighborhoods. 
The group was made up of bankers and 
1 
h 
(( 
" 
awyers w o ran a straw man operation: 
white owners would think they were selling to 
whites when, in fact, the people they met 
were decoys. Once the previous residents had 
left, the new black owners would sign the 
deeds. 

Andy also hopes to explore the excite-
ment of renewal and the problems it created 
through intra-neighborhood conversations. 
These will include three Local History Days 
at the New Haven Free Public Library when 
members of the old neighborhoods will have 
a chance to trade stories in panel discussions. 
He also is working ·on a museum exhibit 
called "Life in the Model City." 

Andy gives me a few CD's of recorded 
interviews. The first is an interview with the 
Reverend Dr. Edwin Edmonds, an Mrican-
American sociology professor at Bennett 
College in Greensboro, North Carolina who 
came to New Haven on February 7, 1959, 
after the racist backlash against integration 
endangered his family. He slowly describes 
taking his two daughters to a "white-only" 
municipal pool supported by his tax money. 
When he got to New Haven, he took a job at 
the Dixwell Church of Christ and continued 
his involvement with the NAACP, which the 
New Haven White Citizens' council had 
declared "treasonous." 

Listening to Edmonds' stories is 
very different from the frenzy of daily life at 
Yale. The stories emerge slowly. 
There is 
something soothing about taking an hour out 
of the day listening to someone who's not 
talking any faster to accommodate your hec-
tic schedule. While Horowitz is busy tran-
scribing interviews to be more rapidly acces-
sible, skimming these stories will have an 
entirely different effect than listening to the 
Reverend speak 
slowly and clearly, proud of 
the fact that he has an eager audience.
