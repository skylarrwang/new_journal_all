To the casual passer-
by,
the southern
face of Louis Kahn's
Yale University Art Gallery
(YUAG) looks the same as
ever: its unrelenting brick
fas;ade
moves
along
Chapel Street · with the
authority it has commanded for over fifty years. But
around the corner on York
Street,
glass
wall ·
reveals a major excavation
taking place. The building's four stories resemble
an
archeological
site.
Kahn's famous tetrahedral
ceiling
weighs
down
upon
dusty
expanse, broken only by
concrete pillars, the occasional ladder, and rows of
glowing work-lights.
The YUAG renovation
is the first phase in a
$94 million capital campaign to transform the
Chapel Street arts area.
When the entire project is
complete, the Art History
Department
will
be
housed in a new building
on York Street, and the
Gallery will reclaim the
space
Egerton
Swartwout's
Old
Art
Gallery, built in 1928, and
Street Hall, built in 1867,
for teaching galleries and
object study classrooms.
Among Gallery staff, it had long been known
that the Kahn building was in need of an
improvement. Because it had never undergone a full scale renovation, the building was
unable to meet some of the technical
demands of a twenty-first century museum.
More importantly, the project needed to
restore Kahn's building to match his original
conception. Kahn had intended the Gallery
to be open expanse, but over the years storage
space and offices carved into the space.
When the Kahn building . reopens its
doors in 2005, it will have more exhibition
space than ever, establishing its primary role
as a museum rather than a multipurpose
space used for galleries, classrooms and
offices.
As Louisa Cunningham, a Deputy
Director of YUAG, explained while she
walked from one expansive floor to the next,
the renovation will "restore the building to
Kahn's original vision." With a renewed
emphasis on Kahn's principal themes of light
and structure, the renovation will allow viewers to appreciate how the interior affects their
relationship to the art.
To understand the
importance of the
current
renovation, one needs to look at
the history of the building's design: the evolution
of Kahn's ideas and
their degradation over
time.
Originally,
University had selected
Philip Goodwin as the
designer for the new
gallery on the corner of
York and Chapel. The
first modern building on
campus, it would mark a
major departure from the
neo-gothic towers that
dominated
University. Goodwin had
co-designed New York's
Museum of Modern Art
1939,
one
Manhattan's
first
International Style buildings, and Yale wanted to
bring this sleek modernism to its campus.
Although Goodwin had
made preliminary sketches
for the Gallery in
1941, he grew frustrated
with the project's stops
and starts and quit in
1951.
Louis Kahn, based at
a firm in Philadelphia,
began lecturing at Yale's
architecture school in
1947. He went abroad as a fellow of the
American Academy in Rome when the
school, in conjunction with the architecture
department, asked him to take over the
Gallery designs. Kahn, over fifty years old
and still without a major commission, quickly
accepted the offer.
Kahn inherited not only the basic rectangular scheme of the Gallery, but a host of
requirements. Still, the ultimate design was
distinctly his own. The closed brick facade
Chapel
Street
departed
from
Goodwin's scheme, as did the glass curtain
