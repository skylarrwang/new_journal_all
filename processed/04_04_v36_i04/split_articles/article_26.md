of the voters are different. If Bush wins the next election, having scared 
Americans so much, the situation is going to be so disgusting, that 
people will wonder. And also, if Kerry wins the election, having told 
Americans that Republicans are, "Public Enemy Number One," that 
also is not healthy. So, what you need is a breed of politicians who are 
able to look for the common ground. In Uganda, that kind of [nega-
tive] politics also exists. People start bad-mouthing each other. 
Sometimes they get so personal. In the last campaign, the incumbent 
accused his challenger of being sick with AIDS. Well, the truth or not 
of it was not debated; but it showed how far people will go in order to 
win an election. The key way to look at the election, therefore, is to 
study human nature. And human nature is the same in America and 
the same in Uganda. 

In a recent article you wrote for 
The Yale Herald, you described how 
travel advisories for JYorthern Uganda 
usually raise more eyebrows than ques-
tions. What do you think accounts for 
this scarcity of demand for information? 

The media in America seldom 
focuses on Africa. It's either famine in 
Ethiopia, the refugees of Sudan, the 
death of dictator Idi Amin, or the war 
in the Congo. Now, the embassies in 
use 
-IS 
Mrica, they know everything that goes on in Uganda, and that's why 
they tell their citizens, "Don't go to ·Northern Uganda." But they don't 
go into the details. 

The media, it marches behind the strong political currents. In 
Uganda, since this current president took over in 1986, he has been 
hailed as a beacon of hope for Africa, he has been described as part of 
a new breed of Mrican leaders. The characteristic of this new breed was 
that they are very much pro-USA. So they have enjoyed a long hon-
eymoon where the USA has not criticized their policies. 

As a result [of these alliances], there is a distonion. In Nonhern 
Uganda, one million people are displaced; economic activity has come 
to a standstill; the HN AIDS infection rate is at thirty percent. Still 
the US government does not question our government's policy! Our 
government is an ally. So, while the Cold War era gave America the 
motivation to suppon thugs like Mbeki, the current war in Iraq is giv-
ing America the motivation to suppon dubious leaders in Africa, 
including our own. And that is why the travel advisories stop at say-
ing, "Don't go there." 

In the same article, you concluded by asking the world to act, and act 
now. What can Yale students do to help? 

At Amani Forum [The Great Lakes Parliamentary Forum on 
Peace], we cany out fact-finding missions. We could have two Yale stu-
dent interns, who can look at the situation. By having Yale Students 
visit conflict regions, and repon on what they see, in a language that

Americans can understand, is one way to help. 

The other way is for Yale students to write to their senators, and 
tell them the money they are sending in aid [to Uganda] is being used 
to fight wars. It has become an industry for removing guilt. You just 
give money to Mrica to . remove guilt. I think America should roll up 
its sleeves and get involved. Yale students can galvanize that pressure 
towards their senators and legislators. The other thing is for them to get 
interested in the issues. I think we need to care about people. 

Somebody said after the Rwandan genocide that if the 200 moun-
tain gorillas had been threatened with extinction, the world would have 
acted more. Instead, for months, people were dying in Rwanda. The 
younger generation ofYale, the "A-B40s" or, "Americans below forty," 
ofYale University, they need to have that feeling of kinship with human 
ID 
beings. Yale students need to start asking 
questions of their leaders. 

Do you think human rights can become a 
voting issue in this country, and in Uganda? 

Elections are very local, and unless the 
human rights issue is a local issue, they 
don't seem to resonate well. But I do think, 
for America, given its pre-eminence in the 
world today, human rights can become an 
issue. I do believe that we can also make 
human rights in Africa an issue. And the start-
ing point is to ask the candidates, what do you think? At the end of the 
day, my only advice to Yale studen~s is to reclaim that sense of outrage 
when things go wrong. We need outrage, outrage about human rights. 

It's not often in the American press that you hear opinions from 
African politicians on the so-called "global war on terrorism. " What are 
your views, and what do you see as Africa's role in the war on terrorism? 

It is our duty, as African leaders, to condemn terrorism. There is 
no place for terrorism in a civilized world. At the same time, it is criti-
cal that we look at the root causes of terrorism. The strategies of ter-
rorists, appear to be based on desperation. There is some deep-seeded 
anger. First, we must show that we understand. The role of sympathy 
·and empathy in diplomacy has been underestimated. There are a few 
things Africans can teach the world about conflict resolution. We must 
find a way to be a family again. Right now, I think many of the Arabs 
don't feel they are members of the world's families. There's a lot of prej-
udice. So, what can the weaker countries of the world do? They can 
teach the powerful countries the power of sympathy. 

You have been praised for your use of proverbs. Do you have a favorite 
proverb? 

I actually don't use proverbs a lot. I use stories. My favorite saying, 
though, is, "Whatever you do, do it as if it is impossible to fail."
