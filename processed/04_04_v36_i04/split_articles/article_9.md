Networked 
With a touch of nostalgia, I pushed open 
the door of Koffee? on Audubon Street and 
greeted a scene with which I had become 
familiar over the past seven months. The cof-
fee shop was overflowing with a diverse mix 
of busybodies and activists, brought together 
courtesy of Meetup, an Internet bulletin 
board that helps unite strangers with shared 
interests. As the local coordinator running 
Meetups on behalf of Wesley Clark's presi-
dential campaign, I was accustomed to stand-
ing in front of a similar group each month at 
Anna Liffey's. These small gro·up gatherings 
were just one piece of·a small nationwide rev-
olution, in which thousands of supporters 
honed Internet technology like Meetup into a 
political tool guaranteed to give candidates a 
boost. For Clark and the previously little-
known Vermont Governor Howard Dean, 
that boost was enough to seize headlines, but 
not victory. Instead, the campaign of John 
Kerry, which is considerably less adept with 
local organizing and Internet technology like 
Meetup, emerged as the Democrats' hope for 
a November victory. 

That's· why tonight's meeting at Koffee? 
was different, and not just for me. Previous 
Meetups had always been devoted to meeting 
on behalf of a particular candidate, but the 
Democratic National Committee had desig-
nated tonight's meeting a special "Unity 
Meetup." Grudgingly, the former Deaniacs 
and Clark supporters were heeding the call to 
transfer their allegiance to the triumphant 
Kerry clan 
and to bring their technology 
with them. 

Meetup's website (www.meetup.com) 
lists over 4,000 topics around which people 
can converge ranging from Bufl}r the Vampire 
Slayer to crocheting 
political groups are 
only a subset, although with the advent of the 
Dean and Clark campaigns, they have 
become a dominant subset. 

Users pick a 
topic, enter their zip code, and find out when 
the next meeting is. The pre-determined 
meeting days fall at the same time on the 
same day each month, so there's no wrangling 
over people's schedules. Venues are deter-
mined by vote: local New Haven spots have 
included Koffee?, Playwright, Anna Liffey's, 
and Olde Blue. The average Meetup involves 
members informally gathering to socialize 
and discuss their common interest over a few 
drinks 
but, as the Dean and Clark cam-
paigns have demonstrated, they can also 
accomplish much more. 

The self-designated leader of the Unity 
Meetup was Ward 22's newly elected 
Democratic Committee co-chair, Alyssa 
Rosenberg. Perched on a table in front of the 
floor-to-ceiling windows at the back of the 
coffee shop, she had her hands full with the . 
restless array of button-clad Democrats who 
filled the room. Some of the crowd consisted 
of bright-eyed political newcomers; others 
were old hands who still weren't sold on this 
newfangled form of mobilization. Most chal-
lenging of all, Rosenberg faced the bemused 
and impatient stares of several contingents of 
Clark and Dean supporters, who had been 
attending and running their own Meetups for 
months. 

One of them, Sharon Steuer, whose 
attachment to the exciting time of Dean's rise 
was visibly intact, is an artist and former 
coordinator for Dean. She sat in a corner 
among a tight cluster of fellow supporters of 
the Vermont Governor and was clearly having 
a hard time concealing her impatience with 
the Democrats who lacked the Dean cam-
paign's adroitness with of local organizing. As 
Rosenberg and members of the audience hes-
itantly considered creating a media response 
committee, Steuer interjected, "The DeaD 
campaign already knows how to do this. Let's 
not reinvent the wheel." 

The vocal but confused comments frofll 
around the room only rein£0rced Steuer's 
annoyance. 

"I have a question: Why are we having all 
of these groups?" said Keith Crane, a. moun-
tainous man whose booming voice startled 
Rosenberg and much of the crowd. "There's 3 
Kerry Meetup tomorrow; why don't we just 
go to that one and get rid of this one? I was 3 
Dean supporter before, but we've got a candi-
date now. It's John Kerry and we should be 
united around him. So why do we need all of 
these different meetings?" Crane's complaintS 
are not without foundation: sometimes, the
