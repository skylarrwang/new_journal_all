<>rt:Mao, 36, a leading advocate for human rights who hails from 
war-torn Northern region of Gulu, Uganda, has spent the past 
nine months studyi,ng as a World Fellow at Yale University. When he 
returns to Uganda this june, where he is currently serving a second term 
in Parliament, Mao will take on a new challenge: campaigning for the 
Presidency in 2006. For someone who began his political career with thir-
teen dollars in his pocket, challenges are nothing new. Having wtinessed 
the atrocities of genocide in his own country, Mao 
believes Afticans can teach the world a lesson in the 
fight against terrorism: empathy. The following are 
excerpts from an interview with The New Journal. 
What is the next presidential candidate for 
Uganda doing here in New Haven? 
I've also been wondering~ Whenever I'm 
invited to talk to people, I end by saying, "What's 
a nice guy like me doing at Yale?" I believe that it 
is important if you have a big mission ahead of 
you, to sort of take a step back. Even Jesus. first 
took forty days in the desert to reflect on his life's 
mission. I'm not Jesus, but I have a mission. I 
decided long ago that before I ran for the office of 
president of Uganda, I would first build a sufficient knowledge base, 
and the World Fellows Program has offered me that opportunity. 


You have been described as a "hero, a kind ofsuperstar for the youth. " 
What is your vision for Uganda, and what is it about this vision that 
speaks to younger people? 
My message appeals to the youth because I tell them that, "The 
earlier generations have m~sed up so much, let's understand why they 
messed up, and then our mission is to correct." And to a large extent, 
the young age at which I went for nationalist elections [helps]. I was 
twenty six when I offered myself for the first election; I lost, which is 
a good thing. I think if you think you're such a hot stuff, you're .horns 
should be pruned a bit. And thank God I got my pruning very early 
in life. 
The young people see me as a spokesman for their generation,. a 
kind of voice. I have reassured them that Uganda is our country. I have 
told them that though we are many tribes in Uganda, we are united by 
poverty, we are united by the lack of water in our villages, we are unit-
ed by illiteracy. 


Also, the views I've expressed in parliament: In 1997, I was a lone 
voice calling for a peaceful settlement for the conflict in the north. I 
thought I was actually digging my political grave. I was saying things 
which must have offended so many of the members. I told them we 
needed to talk to people who were killing our people. But I felt I was 
morally bound to advocate for peace. To stand up, express a view and 
be met with jeers and scorns 
that was trying for me. [But] hardly 
four years later, the Parliament turned around and started pressuring 
the government to talk to the rebels. 


I guess the stronger and bigger the odds that you overcome, the 
more admiration you win. That's the only way I can explain my so-
called heroism. 


What new perspectives, specifically, have you gained as a World 
Fellow? Have any affected or changed the views you originally held? 
. 
Two come to mind. The first is the inequality 
within America. From my general studies, I used to 
know about inequalities between nations. Living 
here in New Haven, I have reflected more on 
inequalities within nations. I have realized that 
America has a lot of challenges in bridging the social 
gaps between those who have, those who have not, 
and those who have little. So that is one thing that 
I go back with: a new look at America's social 
inequalities. 
The other thing is that there is no unanimity. 
on the face that America represents to the world. I 
used to think that every American thought like 
President Bush: you're either with us, or with them. 
A black and white policy where when America 
intervenes they ask the first person they meet, 
. "Who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?" 
I go back to Uganda convinced that Bush is not America. And 
Americans are not Bush. I go back convinced that there is a vigorous 
debate in this country. 


When you infot med your colleagues and your constituency that you 
would be coming to the United States to participate in this program, how 
was the news received? 
What flattered my voters most was the fact that I was chosen from 
so many Africans. I guess that made them feel that, "Well, other peo-
ple have confidence in our choice." But, in life, people also know that 
where you stand determines the level of your influence. Becoming a 
World Fellow puts me in touch with people who are very influential. I 
get emails from people in my constituency, and they say, "Why dont 
you bring the issue of Northern Uganda to the attention of the 
Security Council?" And indeed, when the US Ambassador-to the UN 
came to speak to us, I pulled him aside and addressed him on that mat-
ter. My constituents therefore know that being a World Fellow puts me 
in a position where I can reach key decision makers.

What are your thoughts on this 
campaign, and how does the type of negative politicking he1-e compare to 
your anticipated presidential campaign in Uganda? 
People can get nasty in a campaign, basically because, in America, 
the campaigns are not really managed or run by the candidates. The 
people who choose the words and phrases that politicians say in front
