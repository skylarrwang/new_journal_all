Points of Departure
Studio Haven
“Y
ou see the Apple Store, you see 
L.L.Bean, then you see a black ass 
store, it’s painted black, it looks creepy 
as fuck from the outside. It’s kinda like 
a candy shop, it’s enticing, you’ve gotta 
look in there,” said Palayo Mais, a mul­
timedia artist from New Haven and a 
regular at the Neville Wisdom Fashion
Design Studio.


I spoke with Palayo soon after my 
first visit to the Neville Wisdom studio. 
Before then, I hadn’t spent much time 
perusing the Broadway conglomerates, 
and the name “Neville Wisdom” did lit­
tle to elucidate the purpose of this enig­
matic store. From the words “WHERE 
ARE 
YOUR 
CLOTHES 
MADE?” 
written in big black letters in the tinted 
storefront window, decorated with man­
nequins sporting cocktail dresses and 
streetwear, I could only guess it was 
another one of Broadway’s many high-
priced clothing boutiques. 


What I didn’t know at first was that 
behind the dressy storefront, under­
cover in a sea of corporate strongholds, 
resides the Neville Wisdom Fashion 
Design Studio, a nucleus and safe haven 
for creatives throughout the city. Its 
leading creator and businessperson 
Dwayne Moore Jr. invited me to see
the space myself. 


Dwayne’s relationship with Neville 
Wisdom, after whom the store is named, 
is tightly knit, sewn with years of built 
trust and patience. In just about five 
years, Dwayne went from serendipi­
tously wandering into Neville’s studio 
to recently becoming a partner at the 
business. Starting out as an apprentice 
to Neville, Dwayne developed skills he 
can put to practice as part of the studio’s 
business and as part of his own brand. 
Together, Neville and Dwayne’s income 
is largely made of clothing alterations 
and commissions.


As Dwayne now continues to take 
a more administrative role, Neville 
Wisdom transitions into retirement. 
I couldn’t reach Neville himself for 
this article, as he was on a boat in the 
Caribbean and had lost his phone.


Dwayne gave me a look inside what 
he describes as his second home. 
“This is the space that keeps [the 
studio] alive for the most part,” Dwayne 
said as he led me to the back half of the 
studio. Behind the storefront manne­
quins is a regiment of industrial sew­
ing machines and an artillery of fabrics, 
much of it accumulated thanks to the 
community of local donors that Neville 
himself has established throughout his 
career. Overlooking the studio is a five-
foot tall multimedia portrait of Neville, 
with a black and white base and colorful 
cloth embellishments. Even further back, 
through a narrow hallway overtaken by 
old sewing experiments and works in 
progress is the store’s photography space. 
In this studio, shower thoughts become 
inventive clothing lines, gallery additions, 
and new prints.


“What pulls people in is the win­
dow and the ‘Made in New Haven’ sign,” 
Dwayne tells me. “I think that’s in part 
why people come in here, because it feels 
out of place.” That is, among the sur­
rounding chain stores that boast bright 
curated facades and imported goods, 
Neville Wisdom sticks out.


The Neville Wisdom studio is a 
playground for anyone with a vision. 
Those interested, like Palayo, pay a fee to 
use the space consistently, but all visitors 
are welcome. Drawn to the unique hand­
made pieces that Dwayne documented 
online, Palayo brought himself through 
the doors of the Neville Wisdom
studio to discover what he described as 
a “bat cave.”


Palayo has found solidarity in the 
community Neville and Dwayne have 
built. Some days Palayo leaves with 
armfuls of clothes from Dwayne’s per­
sonal line. One time, Dwayne gave 
Palayo a spare camera to help with his 
photography endeavors. Palayo can 
spend hours at the studio, where he and 
Dwayne will work in the hum of sew­
ing machines and R&B, reflecting on 
each other’s projects, lives, and anything 
else that comes to mind. To Palayo, the 
studio is a sanctuary, a place grounded 
in creativity and camaraderie that has 
been conducive to his growth as an
individual and artist.


Dwayne and I flipped through cata­
logs and portfolios of local New Haven 
artists whose books were proudly dis­
played on the store’s shelves. Meanwhile, 
he told me about a well-meaning cus­
tomer who had reminded him of the 
trials he would experience, especially as 
a Black artist and businessman. Sharing 
racial identity, the customer had told 
Dwayne to be wary of the personalities 
he would meet given his business and 
given its location. “You sound like my 
mom,” Dwayne had laughed, dismissing 
the concern. Negative attention, if any, is 
hardly an issue to him because the indi­
viduals that naturally gravitate toward the 
Neville Wisdom studio are the types of
people he’d want to associate with anyway.


 “The way the front is set up, it’s as if 
only the people I think I would engage 
with come in here. I feel like looking at 
this place you have to be open to wanna 
even come in.” As many new faces as 
he sees, Dwayne feels a strong sense of 
community at the studio, between New 
Haven being his home and the store­
front drawing in like-minded people. 
“You’re already curious,” he said. “I like 
to talk to curious minds.” Dwayne told 
me that the first time he landed outside 
Neville Wisdom’s door he was reading a 
book called Curious Minds, and we mar­
veled at the full-circle moment.


A few times in our conversation, 
Dwayne shifted his attention to help­
ing another studio regular perfect a 
waistband on a pair of shorts. The fab­
ric he was working with was one of his 
own designs, a quadriptych featuring 
the band Kiss. In the closing hours we 
spent talking, a handful of visitors leaked 
in and out of the studio, some custom­
ers and local creators looking to take 
their ideas through the finish line. In the 
Neville Wisdom studio, the storefront 
and the design studio exist in symbiosis.


To Dwayne, his responsibilities in 
the studio are not a clock-in, clock-out 
ordeal—they’re lifestyle, an extension 
of his being. In his eyes, the studio is as 
much a workshop as it is a home. “Some 
nights I’ll just sleep on that couch right 
over there,” Dwayne gestured to the 
satin couch where my coat and tote bag 
were resting.


By many standards, New Haven is 
not the ideal spot for exercising creative 
visions. Palayo believes that the art traf­
fic in New Haven is “nonexistent,” as a 
product of the population and the lack 
of diversity. In New Haven, the culture 
does not seem to demand novelty like 
other larger cities, where the movement 
of people isn’t defined by a monopolizing 
private institution. Meanwhile, Dwayne 
sees the market differently, “It can feel 
small, but I think I’d feel smaller in any 
other city to be fair. It’s about connecting 
with the people who you think resonate 
with you. It depends on how you look
at it for sure.”


“[My] favorite part [is] how open 
it is. In a literal sense and also how 
people perceive it when they walk in. I 
think I like that so much because I’ve 
experienced that exclusivity from peo­
ple not wanting to teach me,” Dwayne 
reflected on the studio’s function in 
the community. “The fashion industry 
seems so exclusive, but we’re more than 
welcome to anyone that wants to be
a part of this.”


The 
Neville 
Wisdom 
Fashion 
Design Studio has taken a new shape 
over the years, especially as a result of 
the pandemic, and will continue to do 
so with the changing leadership, which 
Dwayne believes he can use to draw a 
youthful perspective and energy into the 
studio. The diversity of people and opin­
ions is what he believes will reignite the 
space. “I don’t see it going away or mov­
ing, as much as we downsize,” Dwayne 
asserts, “It says a lot about the useful­
ness to the community.” The studio is 
one-of-a-kind, a place providing people 
of all backgrounds and interests with 
a community that hardly says no and 
relentlessly gives. “In the industry you 
serve the person you work for, and the 
space,” Dwayne explained. “This space
serves me.” ∎

Warm Balls, 
Hot Commodity
B
efore school started, before the packs 
of twelve-person first-year friend 
groups started menacing campus, before 
twelve-packs of Bud Light began to litter 
High Street, I met Lisa Satavu. I walked 
into the Loose Leaf on Whitney Avenue 
on a tepid August day, sweating lightly. 
Satavu had her two children in tow, ages 
7 and 2. We sat down at a table, all four 
of us. I sipped a Banana Foster Milk 
nervously, glancing at the small heart
sharpied on the lid.


Satavu and her husband Marcus own 
and operate a vast array of businesses 
in Connecticut. Yale students before 
my time might remember FroyoWorld 
frozen yogurt shops in the spots where 
the Loose Leaf locations on High Street 
and Whitney Avenue currently stand. 
It was Lisa and her brothers that first 
started what is now a successful, New 
England-wide chain of frozen yogurt 
shops. Satavu and her husband also own 
all Saladcraft and Pokémoto locations
in New Haven.


When I asked her how she came to 
own a Loose Leaf, she told me about 
her business philosophies, about eating 
spoonfuls of red bean as a child, about 
working fourteen hours a day when 
starting FroyoWorld, about her family 
and her life.


Satavu had been a teacher before 
she delved into the food industry. “My 
brothers were always the business guys,” 
she said. After ten years of teaching, she 
decided to join her brothers in manag­
ing their FroyoWorlds. But Satavu said 
that Froyoworld, in New Haven at least, 
had run its course by the time the boba 
industry started to gain mainstream trac­
tion in 2019 and 2020.


“With time, things change, just like 
fashion, just like the interests of peo­
ple,” Satavu said. “Granted, everything 
starts first on the West Coast, but at 
least in our sense, we felt like Yale is 
kind of the heart of the East Coast, with 
all the newest attractions and cultural 
foods. So that’s why we wanted to bring
Loose Leaf here.”


So, like students from across the 
country arriving in droves to the East 
Coast, many for the first time, Loose 
Leaf seems to be another wide-eyed 
West Coast transplant, finding its foot­
ing in New Haven, Connecticut. 


I wrapped up my conversation 
with Satavu. I was under the impres­
sion that I was the one interviewing her, 
but after the twenty minutes I spent 
speaking to her, she offered me a job.


A week later, I was a “bobarista.”

n The Book of Tea, published in 1906, 
the aesthete and art critic Okakura 
Kakuzō detailed the birth, history, and 
beauty of making a simple cup of tea. 
Of primary importance to him was the 
rare harmony of Eastern and Western 
cultures in their enjoyment of tea. 
“Humanity has so far met in a tea-cup,” 
he wrote.


“In the liquid amber,” he wrote, 
“within the ivory-porcelain, the initi­
ated may touch the sweet reticence 
of Confucius, the piquancy of Laotse, 
and the ethereal aroma of Sakyamuni 
himself.” Okakura saw tea-making 
as a religion in and of itself, draw­
ing in philosophies from Buddhism
and Daoism.


I wonder what Okakura would think 
of a typical summer afternoon in the 
bustling kitchen of a Loose Leaf Boba 
shop. Drinks sling with the efficiency of 
hospital triage, bobaphiles coming and 
going, still more young people chatting 
around mouthfuls of the “real tea, real 
ingredients, and real milk” that Loose 
Leaf’s website advertises.


Everything takes on a rosy pink 
tinge in the light of the iconic Loose 
Leaf neon signs. “With my besteas,” 
they proclaim. “Don’t teas’ me!” At the 
table next to me, two boys talk about 
their summer consulting internships 
and their upcoming YSIG (Yale Student 
Investment Group) interviews. Everyone 
is drinking boba.


The tapioca balls, introduced to the 
United States in the late nineteen-eight­
ies by Taiwanese immigrants, go by a 
whole host of monikers in both English 
and Mandarin. There’s the “bubble” in 
bubble tea, tapioca pearls, boba, etcetera 
etcetera. I heard a rumor that the word
“波霸” (romanized, literally “bo” and “ba”)
stemmed from Taiwanese slang for 
boobs. I texted my dad the question: 
“Does 波霸 actually mean breasts in 
Taiwanese slang?”


“Actually, big breasts,” he replied. 
So in its very nature, a kind of orig­
inal sin, perhaps boba is deeply unseri­
ous. Squishy, often warm, globular and 
toothsome—on every Loose Leaf cup 
is the same phrase printed in small font: 
“Caution: Little Warm Balls.” While 
Okakura Kakuzo thought that East and 
West might be unified in tea, boba itself, 
in its spherical glory, might be a com­
plete foil to the seriousness of the tea 
ceremony of East Asian traditions.


Originally sequestered in Taiwanese 
American, and then Asian American, 
communities, boba has quickly spread to 
major cities over the past five years, and 
it’s now firmly rooted in New Haven. 
Vivi Bubble Tea on Chapel, a branch of 
the nationwide chain, opened in 2016. 
Whale Tea on Whitney Avenue opened 
in 2019. The two Loose Leaf locations 
opened in 2021 and 2022. Now, seeing 
students toting the characteristic tall, 
clear cup and black boba-compatible 
straw is commonplace.


Many young Asian Americans raised 
on the West Coast, myself included, 
grew up drinking boba, brightly colored 
and distinctly flavored, in chain stores 
like Tea Station and Lollicup. Back then, 
drinking boba was weird. It was a for­
eign drink, and the pearls were a textural 
and geometric shock. Years later, every­
one is drinking boba, from California
to Connecticut.


Loose Leaf, like so many other 
national boba chains, began on the West 
Coast. As the sun was going down on a 
scorching California day, I met Thomas 
Liu and Jasmine Yip, the founders 
of Loose Leaf, at their Los Angeles 
Melrose location. We spoke under a 
faux-fresco mural of The Last Supper 
starring Bernie Sanders, Cardi B, Kurt 
Cobain, Trevor Noah, Oprah Winfrey, 
and Ellen DeGeneres, drinking pale 
beige cups of boba.


Liu grew up in the San Gabriel 
Valley, a predominantly Asian suburb of 
Southern California, just twenty miles 
shy of the city of Los Angeles. “It was 
Asians on top of Asians,” he said. “There 
was a boba shop on every corner.”


The complicated cultural makeup of 
his family, the majority of which moved 
to Vietnam from China after the 1911 
Xinhai Revolution, informs his interest 
in the food industry. It informs the menu 
choices at Loose Leaf, too: offerings 
range from drinks incorporating pandan, 
a green Southeast Asian leaf that tastes 
like vanilla and coconut, to the “POG 
Agua Fresca,” inspired by Mexican road­
side beverage stands. 


But both Yip and Liu never shook 
the idea that boba’s shape, texture, and 
name were something to laugh at. 
Jasmine said that their brand is based on 
the idea that humor, like food, bridges 
wide gaps. Loose Leaf’s voicemail 
directs you to place an online order at 
“warmballs.com.”


“Everything you do, just enjoy your 
life,” Yip said. “Customers who have a 
sense of humor will see you like you’re 
real people.”


I look up at Jesus-Bernie painted 
onto the wall, his arms spread open as if 
proselytizing, and Judas-Oprah grasp­
ing a cup of boba in her traitorous hand. 
Sense of humor, indeed. 


Paul Freedman, a serious, glasses-
wearing man surrounded by shelves of 
colorful books, is a Professor of History 
and a Medievalist specializing in 
Catalonian and cuisine history. Standing 
among the last bastions of non-boba 
drinkers, he believes that consuming cul­
ture, such as media and food, is a mis­
guided way to understand people.


“I don’t think that gastronomy is a 
path toward understanding,” he told me 
when I interviewed him. “People your 
age have been taught a lot of pieties in 
high school . . . ‘Oh, if we just eat a lot of 
Vietnamese food, we’re gonna under­
stand a lot more about Vietnam’ is in that 
category of comforting pieties.” 


I thought back to reading about 
the religious history and ceremonies 
surrounding tea culture in Japan and 
China. I wonder if the way that tea has 
evolved has required an evolution of the 
way we worship it, that drinking boba 
tea requires a repetition of “comforting 
pieties” to be palatable. 


However, many boba shop owners 
that I interviewed espoused the idea 
that boba actually can in fact bridge gaps 
between people and serve as an intro­
duction to Asian culture and foods. Lisa 
Satavu is one of them.

these flavors, their vision gets a little bit
more open about certain things,” she said.
In Whale Tea on Whitney Avenue, 
couples sipped each other’s drinks and 
groups of friends studied the complex 
menu together as I spoke with Jessie 
Cheung ’24. Cheung is familiar with 
how boba functions both as a business 
and a social setting. She is from Dallas, 
where her family opened Texas’s first 
ViVi Bubble Tea franchise. They have 
since helped establish three ViVi stores 
across the state. Cheung points to a ris­
ing interest in East Asian food and cul­
ture, sometimes referred to as the Hallyu 
Wave, as one reason for the rise in
boba consumption.
“Asian culture is now so much more 
prolific, especially with the popularity 
of Korean culture,” Cheung said. “So 
a lot of people have been starting to 
engage with boba because it’s so easy. It’s 
like, instead of getting a coffee, which 
is a very American thing, you can just
get a drink.”
It is boba’s ambiguous identity as an 
“Asian” drink, now mutated into some­
thing unquestionably American, that 
makes it so interesting to me. While 
boba is now “easy” to consume, (conve­
nient and ubiquitous and, God forbid, 
“trendy”) it contains so much baggage. 
Some Asian-Americans have started 
using the phrase “lunchbox moment” to 
describe the times when we opened our 
lunch boxes full of kimchi and gyoza 
and curry and fried rice and glass noo­
dles, and were met with caterwauls of “It 
stinks!” or “Ew, what is that?” Drinking 
boba in the presence of people who 
didn’t know what it was used to be a 
textbook lunchbox moment. Now, every­
one is drinking boba.
My friend Shane Zhang ’25, remem­
bers getting boba with his friends almost 
every Friday in high school. When 
he drank boba, he said, it was a way of 
enjoying a quasi-Asian drink that was 
palatable to non-Asian friends.
“It’s like I’m Colossus of Rhodes—I 
straddle two worlds,” he said. “My balls 
hang in the balance.”
I thought of the mythical statue 
at Rhodes, presiding over intercultural 
trade and commerce, and about boba, 
trapped between cultures today. As a cul­
tural export, as a marker of the migration 
of people and labor from Asia, boba does 
hang in the balance. Not quite one world, 
not quite the other.
In many ways, Loose Leaf’s mar­
keting and naming seems to be a per­
fect example of the evolution of what 
the concept of “tea” means, from Asia to 
America, from 1906 to 2022, through a 
twisting gyre of time and space, to end 
up in the plastic plant wall of a Loose 
Leaf in New Haven, Connecticut.
Boba, when it first came to the U.S., 
was categorized by the artificial powders, 
colors, and flavors that Loose Leaf now 
disavows. While perhaps the moralizing 
question of authenticity—whether or not 
the evolution of boba has been a “good” 
or “bad” thing—is unimportant, what is 
notable is understanding its journey: as a 
commodity, the vast distance it has trav­
eled; as a cultural practice and tradition, 
the long span of time it has endured. My 
feelings about boba are complicated—it 
feels good to know that American people 
are accepting of a drink with Taiwanese 
origins, that they would be willing to 
try a beverage with pandan in it. But I 
think about telling myself comforting 
pieties in the acceptance of boba’s pop­
ularity, that I might just have to accept 
the fact that I will feel conflicted about 
white people drinking boba, unaware of
its larger history, for the rest of my life.
During my brief tenure at Loose 
Leaf, I had to remake many drinks. I 
would pour out the drink in the sink, 
milks of all colors swirling down the 
drain, down into the belly of the hidden 
sewer system. The boba would be left 
behind, sticky balls clumping up at the 
drain. I had to stick my hand directly 
into the ballish void to force them down 
the drain, which was always a slightly 
repulsive but nonetheless deeply satisfy­
ing feeling.
I remember my fists full of boba, cup­
ping humanity’s tapioca in my teacup of
a hand. Then I squished them down. ∎

n John Cavaliere’s shaky iPhone 
recording of a late-summer rain­
storm in 2021, a manhole cover at the 
intersection of West Rock and Whalley 
Avenue has blown off, and become a 
spewing, 2-foot-high fountain. Water—
mired to an unsettling blackness—roils 
and sloshes against the side of his porch. 
The cars that manage to pass flash their 
emergency blinkers as they squelch 
through the flood, tires half submerged 
in the filthy mix of sewage and run­
off. Raindrops streak slantwise through 
the frame. The water is unstoppable;
the water is everywhere.
Cavaliere, owner of the antique 
shop Lyric Hall, has lived through vio­
lent floods for the past ten years. He has 
plenty of footage to show for it—videos 
of him trekking down the stairs in the 
middle of the night to find a pool of 
grayish water at calf-level in the base­
ment, lapping at wooden chair legs and 
picture frames. Along with the video 
clips, which he keeps in the hopes of 
showing the city officials, he’s typed up 
the measurements of every flood on a 
sheet of printer paper. “On May 7, 2011 
there was 3 feet. On August 15, 2012, 
there was 4 feet, 2 inches,” he reads. The 
numbers only grow, tending in the same 
direction as the sea levels in Long Island 
sound. “In July 2021, 6 feet, 5 inches. In 
September 2021, that was almost 7 feet.”
He sets the folded sheet on the 
wooden end table near the display 
window. The two of us are standing in 
Cavaliere’s small, one-story shop; it’s 
October, 2022. There’s a deep sigh. “[The 
floods have] taken out the HVAC [Heating, 
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning] sys­
tems, the heating [and] air conditioning 
systems, so many times I can’t keep up.” 
Cavaliere, who refurbishes old artwork 
and repairs gilded picture frames for a 
living, used to keep his workshop in the 
basement, until repeated flooding events 
forced him to relocate to the main floor. 
His gilt molds and picture frames now 
lie sprawled across a storefront table. He 
tries not to think of all the antiques and 
artworks he’s lost over the years.
Today, the store has no heating. 
Instead, Cavaliere uses a cast-iron wood 
stove squatting in the center of the room. 
He took the furnace out of the basement 
years ago, fearing that a flood might 
reach his home’s electrical panels. If any 
electrical panels got submerged and he 
accidentally stepped into the water, he 
explained, “I could get electrocuted.”
Cavaliere and his fellow Westville 
residents have watched these sewage 
overflows increase in frequency against 
a trend of rising sea levels and intensify­
ing storms. They’ve sent dozens of emails 
to state and local officials, which all go 
either largely unanswered or forwarded 
to other representatives. Just last month 
he sent a sample of floodwater from 
near the basement stairway to Baron 
Analytical Laboratories. The results came 
back the next day, concluding that fecal 
coliforms in the water “were too high to 
accurately count.” When the water dries, 
streets and sidewalks are left with toxic 
residue and bacteria. “In other words, 
you know, we could get E. coli, Hepatitis 
A, typhoid from all these microbes.”
Flooding has upended Cavaliere’s 
life. “It does something to you all these 
times,” he said. “It’s traumatic.”
C
ombined Sewer Overflow (CSO) 
is common in cities with older 
wastewater infrastructure, according to 
Colleen Murphy-Dunning, director of 
the Urban Resources Initiative (URI). 
Most infrastructure built throughout 
the mid-to-late 1800s was designed with 
a single sewage pipe. Waste from toi­
lets and bathtubs would combine with 
stormwater runoff and be transported to 
the processing facilities in East Shore.
The single pipe design quickly 
retired in the years following the 1970 
Clean Water Act, after officials realized 
that it was causing waste to be directly 
discharged into the rivers. During 
heavy rainstorms when the water vol­
ume exceeded carrying capacity, the 
single pipe system would resort to an 
“outfall”—a safety valve that expelled 
untreated sewage straight into the rivers. 
Cities like New Haven had been wash­
ing feces directly to the Long Island 
Sound. Under the Clean Water Act, 
this wastewater system would be legally 
required to improve.
At least, it was supposed to be. 
Despite the intentions of the Clean 
Water Act, New Haven has been 
slow to develop its infrastructure. 
Most of the city’s historic neighbor­
hoods—downtown, 
Wooster 
Square, 
Dixwell, Westville—continue to use the 
combined sewer system.
There are more immediate conse­
quences to the single pipe system than 
feces in the rivers. Faced with more sew­
age than it can handle, enough pressure 
builds up to pop manhole covers off and 
send its contents spilling all over the 
street. “It’s pretty nasty,” Chris Ozyck, 
URI’s associate director, said as we drove 
down Front Street in his pickup. He 
pointed out the townhouse complexes 
on the slope to our right, where storm­
water often rushes down and over­
whelms the pipes. As it moves downhill, 
the sewage-runoff mixture often gets 
backed up near low-lying areas and 
floods the streets.
Like most historic urban areas, not 
all of New Haven’s 555 mile-long sew­
age system is the same. Most streets 
constructed farther from downtown 
now use two pipes—one which spe­
cializes in collecting runoff stormwater 
from the catch-basins, and another that 
connects to each home’s sewage system. 
Doing so prevents the sewage flooding
from happening.
The situation in Newhallville, a 
neighborhood in New Haven’s Ward 22,
is one such instance of this. Though 
Ozyck told me that some basements in 
the neighborhood had been flooding, 
the culprit seems to be purely runoff 
for now. Most of Newhallville’s streets 
have two sewer pipes, which has so far 
spared its residents of the feces-laden 
horrors. Hunter Irwin, a local resident 
on Shelton Avenue, moved here for his 
job at Yale-New Haven Hospital during 
the beginning of the pandemic and has 
braved three years of unrelenting storms. 
He admitted that runoff stormwater can 
still be a problem—it collects on the 
curbside and the empty lot across the 
street, especially during late summer 
thunderstorms—but so far, it hasn’t been 
much of a concern.
Dawn Henning, a New Haven city 
engineer, said that the city has been 
working steadily to outfit older dis­
tricts with separate sewer pipes. That’s 
where URI has stepped in. As part of 
an effort to divert excess runoff from 
entering the sewage pipes, the nonprofit 
applied for grant funding and accepted 
contracts with the city government to 
install bioswales–trenches filled with 
shrubs and vegetation that receive runoff 
With water levels rising, the observation deck at the end of Clifton Street in Fair Haven is crumbling into the sound.

water–in the most flood-vulnerable cor­
ners of New Haven. Since 2014, Ozyck 
and his crew have installed almost four 
hundred of them across the city.
On a Friday afternoon in October, 
he and I visited the very first bioswale in 
New Haven, just outside the Berzelius 
secret society on Trumbull Street. The 
rain from the night before collected in 
tiny puddles by the curbside. The lower 
leaves of the bioswale’s inkberries and 
daylilies glistened with water droplets. 
The soil in the swale felt cool and damp 
to touch, a sign that the plants in the 
bioswale had been busy filtering away 
neighborhoods like Fair Haven have 
already started eroding. “What used to 
be a fifty-year storm is now a ten-year 
storm,” said Ozyck. In other words, a 
storm with a severity seen only once every 
fifty years is now occurring in every ten.
On Front Street, he showed me homes 
facing the Quinnipiac River with par­
tial-underground basements that—like 
Lyric Hall—have experienced a signifi­
cant uptick in flooding. From the end of 
Clifton Street, we saw a building partially 
sinking into the river. The guardrail of 
the outlook we stood on was just inches 
away from touching the water itself. 
Rising sea levels, Ozyck said, has only 
increased the odds of flooding. Water 
from the riverbanks will naturally spill 
onto the streets during an intense rain 
event, stressing the already aged parts of 
the city’s sewage system and threatening 
to make overflows of Westville’s kind 
dramatically more frequent.
Part of preventing these sewage 
outpourings will therefore require pro­­
tecting the city from floods. Single sewer 
pipes like those in Westville are begin­
ning to overflow with greater regularity 
as ever-intensifying flood events strain 
their capacity. Less flooding, then, would 
mean less overflow. After Hurricane 
Sandy and Irene hit in 2011, the engi­
neering department received grants 
from the state and federal government 
for future flood protection. One of them, 
the Community Development Block 
Grant, awarded $4 million to studying 
green infrastructure development in the 
Long Wharf area. The research, which 


the runoff. The idea was to return rain­
water back into the soil, where it would 
be taken up by street trees and absorbed 
into the water table.
“It’s mimicking what nature wants 
to happen with water, which is that it 
should go through soils and down and 
recharge the subsurface water light table,” 
Murphy-Dunning said. In the process, 
the soil ends up cleaning the water in 
ways that traditional treatment plants do 
not. The bioswale’s success on Trumbull 
exceeded their initial expectations: by 
naturally filtering the run-off, it man­
aged to save a street that had long suf­
fered from chronic flooding.


C
limate change has only intensified 
these sewage overflow events. “The 
more we experience sea level rise and 
just . . . higher and higher levels in the 
harbor, the more that reduces the capac­
ity of our storm system and . . . the more 
we see that flooding,” said Henning.
Global warming’s effects are begin­
ning to be felt in a city that sits right 
along the water’s edge. “There were 
a series of storms that happened [in] 
2010 through 2015, in addition to hurri­
canes Sandy and Irene, that were really 
intense [and] had high return frequen­
cies,” said Henning. During that time, 
ten- and twenty-five-year storms swept 
through the city almost yearly. That 
hasn’t improved: storms that are statisti­
cally only suppposed to occur once every 
five to ten years are hitting New Haven 
annually, explained Henning.
Streets like Quinnipiac Avenue and 

Henning was responsible for, explored 
potential green solutions.
Long Wharf, which is directly beside 
the Long Island Sound, is currently one 
of the areas most vulnerable to flooding. 
The first phase of their proposed FEMA-
grant project will expand Long Wharf’s 
current drainage capacity by construct­
ing a 10-foot diameter pipe from the 
police station out to the harbor. Another 
project, led by the Army Corps of 
Engineers, has plans to build a flood wall 
along the sea-facing I-95 and install a 
pump station. In plans to protect the city 
from sea level rise roughly half a meter 
higher than the national average by 2050. 
Combined, the total costs work out to
roughly $195.8 million.
The completion dates of both proj­
ects remain uncertain. The tunnel pro­
posal is currently under review, which 
Henning admitted “can take a while.” 
After the agreement, she expects another 
six months for permitting and two years 
of construction. The flood wall awaits two 
years of design and a three- to four-year
construction period.
Bioswales, meanwhile, have pro­
vided a faster—and possibly more 
efficient—short-term solution for the 
city. “Green infrastructure is much less 
disruptive to install,” Murphy-Dunning 
said. One of the greatest challenges to 
updating the single-sewer system is its 
cost and labor: adding another pipe calls 
for digging up the entire road, creating 
a trench, and connecting the newly-laid 
pipe to every curbside catch-basin. By 
collecting runoff on the streets, bioswales 
help ease the strain on the existing single-
pipe sewage system.
Murphy recognized the importance 
of the city’s current ­flood-protection 
projects, but she also brought up the 
importance of managing its existing 
impervious surfaces. Man-made mate­
rials, such as asphalt, increase the odds 
of flooding by preventing runoff from 
entering the ground. And while larger 
drainage pipes will certainly help, the 
flooding will only return if the city con­
tinues to develop over existing green 
spaces at the rate it currently is.
Henning tells me that the city 
itself has no jurisdiction over combined 
sewage. The engineering department 
only oversees storm drainage; the san­
itary system is managed instead by the 


greater New Haven Water Pollution 
Control 
Authority, 
a 
quasi-private 
entity that has its own long-term con­
trol plans. However, Henning did note 
that “they are under consent order by the 
[Environmental Protection Agency] to 
manage the two-year six-hour storm and 
to have essentially no overflows.”
As it waits for approval on its land­
mark projects, the city has continued to 
take steps towards flood resilience. Some 
of its smaller projects include replacing 
hundred-year-old clay pipes and clean­
ing curbside catch-basins.
With grant funding used up, bio-
swale construction has stopped. Its 
maintenance remains in the hands of 

Cavaliere and his fellow 
Westville residents have 
watched these sewage 
overflows increase in 
frequency against a trend 
of rising sea levels and 
intensifying storms.


Getting the resources and making sure 
there is enough to go around will take 
time. Making sure every neighborhood 
receives the funding they need, how­
ever, is easier said than done. “We get 
this investment for downtown, but how 
does it appear in some other part of the 
city . . . ? It’s tough,” she said.


O
n September 6th, 2022, New Haven 
received 4 inches of rain in six 
hours—a month’s worth of precipitation 
packed into the span of a day. Rainwater 
streamed down streets, bogging cars 
and school buses. At Yale, Bass Library 
flooded; Benjamin Franklin’s dining 
halls seeped water; and the floor of base­
ment butteries grew slick.
That day, in the basement of Lyric 
Hall, Cavaliere recorded 9 inches.
As a densifying urban area, New 
Haven faces a unique set of challenges. 
The city has to contend with runoff along 
concrete surfaces and rising sea levels, 
bearing the brunt of both inland and 
coastal flooding. “We’re kind of getting 
it from all angles,” said Henning.
Back at Lyric Hall, it is mid-October 
and not quite yet the tail of fall. Sunlight 
URI. During our meeting Ozyck pulled 
his truck over to the side of Grove Street, 
walked out, and tugged out a mat of 
browning red oak leaves from the bot­
tom. Bioswales have to be constantly 
monitored and maintained to function 
properly, he said. Repairing broken 
guardrails, granite edging, and remov­
ing yard-waste is a months-long project
for the nonprofit.
“I think we try to work on all 
scales,” Henning said. She looks for­
ward to running studies using a geo­
graphic imaging system that will help 
the city capture more data. For areas 
like Westville’s Whalley Avenue and 
Forest Road, she noted that “we’re kind 
of in the study phase of the flooding.” 

And while larger drainage 
pipes will certainly help, the 
flooding will only return if 
the city continues to develop
over existing green spaces at 
the rate it currently is.

pet at the shop’s entrance, like any other 
day. The only traces of last month’s flood 
might be the basement’s faint mustiness 
as Cavaliere shows me the ball valve he 
installed. Closing it would shut the pipe 
that leads to the street sewer main and 
keep sewage from backing up into the 
toilet. Now, he explained, the plan is 
to apply for grant funding that would

foundations.
The back of the house is paint-
peeled and sagging. Recently, though, a 
friend had helped repair the side of the 
basement. Cavaliere looked out at the 
pool of golden leaves across the street. 
Despite all the challenges he has expe­
rienced, he’s still hopeful: “It’s a miracle 
that I’ve managed to survive all this but 
I think it’s because I just feel so loved by 
the community and I love my commu­
nity, and I am doing exactly what I want 
to do in my life.” ∎

We sit in the air-conditioned Starbucks
and she says, heaven is a place on Earth,
Starbucks is a place on Earth,

Now we’re laughing,
of course ironic about neoliberal bliss 
but there’s a part of us that means it, 
wants to languish in these velvet chairs forever.

Julia recounts to me the story of Job, 
all that was given and taken away by God. 
We talk about her gamer ex-boyfriend 
who is wasting his brief store of potential. 
She ended things and misses him. 
We are both so greedy,
I tell her on the park bench now, 
devouring cold peanut noodles from the to-go container.

We hear an organ from the church service, 
priest’s deep voice, body of wafer, 
blood of wine. We rush to the door and peer in, 
noses pressed to the stained glass, 
anthropologists of this neighborhood and its ambient humidity.

We hold each other’s hands and wait to ascend,
to be let in, knowing we’re Jewish and we’re stoned
and we won’t, we fucking won’t.

walk slowly from block to block glowing under the moonlight and the dripping 
neon silhouettes of storefronts, of provision, and of humanity. It’s been effaced, it’s 
been erased, it’s been eradicated. A small space, already designated for a people, 
sequestered further and further—a nation condensed into a city condensed into a 
town condensed into a district condensed into a small boat rocking endlessly on 
an uneven and cruel ocean, waiting to topple and capsize. Squashed in between a 
trendy French bistro and an upscale ‘dirtbag’ bar is the stall we grab dinner at. The 
aunty firmly places our fried dumplings in a styrofoam box with chopsticks—E. 
tells me that the aunty likes me, but there’s not a hint of kindness in her eyes, how could there 
be? It’s too much to ask someone to be kind when all they’ve known is violence. As we plop the 
steaming jiaozhi in our mouths, E. points out a mural of pigeons playing mahjong. Their feathers

the lion’s head swallowing a hongbao as a diverse group of onlookers clap in joy. The lion, a symbol 
of dominion and masculinity in the west, is representative of community here. We bounce from

It’s not easy to make 
the choice to stay.

New Haven Public School teachers are leaving 
for nearby districts with higher wages.

I
t’s 8:35 on a weekday morning, and 
students are filing into the Augusta 
Lewis Troup school in New Haven. 
Visible through the glass face of the 
building, clusters of middle-schoolers 
chat unhurriedly. Backpacked students 
bottleneck at the school’s front doors 
and spill out onto the wide stretch of 
pavement outside.

Sixth-grade teacher Da’Jhon Jett has 
been preparing in his classroom since 7:15 
this morning. Today, his three gifted and 
talented students—students who read 
well above a sixth-grade level—might 
finish independent work early. Jett hopes 
that they’ll use the advanced books, pur­
chased with his own money, to occupy 
themselves while he teaches four of his 
other students to identify the letters of 
the alphabet. Of his twenty-one students, 
four are learning English as a second 
language. Four are working on letter 
identification, and six need more special 
education support than they currently 
receive. Jett is not trained as a teacher of 
special education or English Language
Learners (ELLs). But since Augusta Lewis 
Troup lacks enough specially trained 
educators, these students have landed
in Jett’s classroom.

Low pay and tough working con­
ditions have triggered a mass exo­
dus of teachers from the profession. 
Nationwide, starting teacher salaries 
have sunk to the lowest level since the 
Great Recession (after adjustment for 
inflation). Pay—decided years in advance 
by union contracts—has not kept up 
with the rapid rise in cost of living. Since 
January 2021, rates of resignation have 
grown in educational services faster than 
in any other industry because of low pay 
and overwhelming expectations.

In New Haven, the impact on stu­
dents is especially dire. The city can’t 
compete with the salaries and working 
conditions of other Connecticut districts, 
which benefit from more local property 
tax revenue. Teachers are leaving New 
Haven to fill better-funded vacancies in 
wealthier districts, primarily in Fairfield, 
leaving the teachers who stay to pick 
up the slack. All six of the teachers I 
interviewed for this article 
know people who recently left 
the district.

Ryan Boroski is a Social 
Studies teacher at the Co-
operative Arts & Humanities 
High School. “Two of my 
friends left this year,” he told me. 
“One was going to make 50 per­
cent more and one was going to 
make 35 percent more.”

When some teachers leave, 
class sizes increase for those 
who stay. Steve Baumann, an 
eighth-grade science tea­cher in 
his tenth year at the Conte West 
Hills school in New Haven, 
explained how classroom man­
agement suffers in large classes: 
“If you have twenty-five students 
and you have even three that are really 
off-behavior, it can really throw off the 
dynamic of the whole class.” Jett also 
said that he often feels unable to teach 
effectively with so many students in the 
classroom. Leslie Blatteau, President of 
the New Haven Federation of Teachers 
Local 933, said, “Right now we’re jug­
gling the jobsof many people . . . it wears 
on energy and morale.”

All six of the teachers interviewed 
had classes larger than twenty-five stu­
dents. Eighteen or fewer is generally 
considered ideal.

J
ett, who is Black, began teaching 
because he wanted to show students 
of color that “we can . . . lead in the class­
room.” However, with increasing pres­
sures from the school to cater to students 
with vastly different needs, Jett told me, 
he has little time to get to know his stu­
dents one-on-one.

Before moving to New Haven, Jett 
taught in Hamden, where average profi­
ciencies in math and reading are 43 and 
50 percent, respectively. In New Haven, 
these rates are 22 percent and 35 per­
cent. Jett attributed the discrepancy in 
achievement between New Haven and 
Hamden in large part to overwhelming 
class sizes. This year, Jett was relieved that 
his class only had twenty-one students, 
a decrease from last year’s twenty sev­
en-student class. But he still struggles 
to get everyone on the same page. Of 
the low reading levels among some 
of his students, Jett told me, “I didn’t 
know until I got there. I didn’t believe 
it until I got there. I just didn’t think it
could be that low.”

Though conditions of teaching in 
New Haven—class sizes, low pay, and 
long hours—have induced some teachers 
to leave the district, the six New Haven 
teachers I spoke with are committed 
to helping their New Haven students. 
Teachers cited New Haven’s unique 
diversity and the new union leadership’s 
commitment to improving teaching and 
learning conditions as reasons for staying. 
The New Haven school district is in the 
top one percent in the state for racial and 
ethnic diversity, and 88 percent of its stu­
dents are Black or Latinx.

Blatteau, who has taught social stud­
ies in New Haven since 2007, won her 
election to union president in December 
2021. She ran alongside a slate of candi­
dates that included Wilbur Cross High 
School counselor Mia Comulada as sec­
retary. Before the election, Blatteau and 
her colleagues asked teachers what they 
wanted to change about their jobs. Many 
responded that their “working condi­
tions are students’ learning conditions,”

and that students and teachers have 
“shared concerns, experiences, values, and 
should have shared action.”

The concerns that Blatteau and her 
colleagues saw emerge in conversations 
with teachers—especially the stagnant 
pay, despite growing responsibilities—
were similar to those I heard. All of the 
teachers I interviewed said they worked 
more than the 6.75-hour day stipulated 
in their contract. Kris Wetmore, a visual 
arts teacher at New Haven’s Cooperative 
Arts & Humanities High School, told 
me she’s improving her work-life bal­
ance and trying not to work beyond 7:30 
a.m. to 2:15 p.m., “the hours I’m getting 
paid for.” Still, Wetmore admitted that 
she usually has to get to work early and 
spend some time working on weekends 
to prepare for the week’s lessons. Jett 
added, “If any of us just worked for the 
6.75-hour day, no one would get anything 
done.” No one felt that their pay fairly 
compensated these long hours. 
Boroski feels low teacher pay reveals 
the city’s priorities. “I know no one gets 
into this job for the money, but . . . the sal­
ary in New Haven is a reflection of the 
lack of respect for teachers.”


T
eachers have long been subject to 
lower salaries than similarly educated 
professionals for their demanding work. 
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020, Blatteau explained, wages stag­
nated when the city negotiated a pay 
freeze that stopped the regular schedule 
of raises stipulated in the union contract. 
Since teacher pay schedules lay out pay 
for a teacher’s entire career, a one-year 
pay freeze meant that teachers were set 
back a full year in their schedule of raises. 
“This really robs teachers who are going 
into retirement because their pensions 
are dependent on their salary,” Baumann 
said, emphasizing the impact of pay 
freezes on long-term teachers.


Local activists and union organiz­
ers have attributed the deficit in New 
Haven public school funding to Yale’s 
paltry contributions to the city. Davarian 
Baldwin is a political science professor 
at Trinity College and Director of the 
Smart Cities Lab, which facilitates col­
laboration with eleven cities on problems 
involving municipal services includ­
ing public transportation, housing, and 
schools. In the past, Baldwin has worked 
with New Haven Rising, a local activ­
ist group whose demands include an 
increased voluntary contribution from 
Yale. Baldwin said that top colleges like 
Yale are “built on the plunder of their cit­
ies,” and he highlighted Yale’s property 
tax break as a prime example.


Daniel HoSang is professor of 
Ethnicity, Race and Migration at 
Yale and a founding member of the 
Anti-Racist Teaching and Learning 
Collaborative. He, Blatteau, and Wilbur 
Cross counselor Mia Cormulada helped 
me understand the complex structure 
that determines public school funding, 
which in turn determines teacher salaries. 
School funding is allocated at a few lev­
els: first, the city of New Haven deter­
mines its annual budget, which includes 
all of the money that will be used for 
municipal services in the city. This 
money comes primarily from property 
taxes (New Haven’s city assessor, Alex 
Pullen, did not respond to questions 
about local funding, which accounts for 
58.8 percent of total school funding). 
Funding from property taxes does 
not include money from Yale’s volun­
tary contribution to the city, which was 
$23.2 million this year. In 2019, activists 
in New Haven Rising estimated that 
Yale would have paid $146,079,896 if 
its property was taxed as private, 40 per­
cent of the $364,659,346 total public 
school budget for New Haven that year. 
Yale’s property holdings in New Haven
are increasing every year.


The district gets a small amount of 
funding—approximately 4 percent in 
2020—from the federal government, 
and the city also gets 37.3 percent of 
school funding from the state, includ­
ing money from the Payment in Lieu of 
Taxes (PILOT) program. The PILOT pro­
gram gives $90 million in state funding 
to New Haven to make up for property 
tax revenue lost because of the city’s 
large swaths of untaxed property, mostly 
owned by Yale and Yale New Haven 
Health. When it comes to Yale’s tax 
break, this still leaves about $56 million
unaccounted for.


Baldwin likened Yale’s tax break to 
a subsidy that New Haven grants the 
University each year. When discuss­
ing his work with New Haven Rising, 
Baldwin said, “We want to create pol­
icies that induce schools like Yale to be 
better neighbors.” Blatteau added, “Yale 
could really right the wrongs of the his­
toric underfunding of public schools that 
they have contributed to by taking up so 
much untaxed property.”


Lauren Zucker, Yale’s associate 
vice president for New Haven Affairs 
and University Properties, responded 
to questions about Yale’s relationship 
with New Haven in an email: “Yale is 
proud of its commitment to our home 
city . . . the University pays approximately 
$5 million in property taxes . . . making 
Yale among the top three real estate 
taxpayers in New Haven.” She also 
emphasized Yale’s cultural contributions 
to the city, including the University’s 
Pathways to Science and Pathways 
to Arts and Humanities programs for
New Haven Public School students and 
Yale’s public museums.


Zucker cited Yale’s recent “historic 
increase” in voluntary payments to the 
city, and this year’s $23.2 million contri­
bution. $23.2 million is 15.7 percent of 
what Yale would pay if its buildings were 
taxed like private property, according to 
the 2019 calculations from New Haven 
Rising cited earlier. Yale’s voluntary con­
tribution still leaves New Haven about 
$33 million short in property tax revenue. 
HoSang added that Yale is not 
entirely to blame for the harms its 
untaxed property has wrought on the 
city. “After all, Yale didn’t author the laws 
that keep it from paying taxes,” he said. 
Yale’s status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit orga­
nization means that the school is exempt 
from all taxes on educational property 
buildings where instruction takes place.


New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker 
acknowledged that there is much work 
to be done to secure adequate funding for 
public schools, but he said, “We’re seeing 
both [Yale and the state of Connecticut] 
take significant steps to address these 
problems.” 
Elicker 
attributed 
the
lack of money for schools to Connecticut 
counties’ overreliance on city-limited 
property tax revenue. Property taxes 
from suburbs and rural areas around 
New Haven don’t contribute to the 
city’s revenue. In contrast, Elicker said 
that other states distribute funding by 
county, spreading property tax revenue 
more evenly. New Haven schools would 
be better funded if the city adopted this 
system. Still, in Elicker’s view, “the city 
of New Haven works very hard with very 
limited resources to support funding for 
our public schools.”


Even within the district, however, 
funding is unequally distributed. Jett told 
me that the Wexler Grant Community 
school, a mile away from his school 
between Dixwell Avenue 
and Canal Street, has 
two 
sixth-grade 
class­
rooms and twenty-three 
sixth graders. In smaller 
settings, 
teachers 
can 
work with each student 
to meet their needs. The 
school district’s spokes­
person, 
Justin 
Harmon, 
explained 
how funding is allocated in an email: 
“Neighborhood schools vary in enroll­
ments as the population around them 
swells or declines,” he said. “Wexler is in a
period of decline. Over time, the district 
makes staffing and program adjustments 
in an effort to rebalance the distribution 
of students and teachers from school 
to school.” Blatteau maintains that the 
public school deficit is an illusion: “If 
schools were a genuine priority,” she said, 
“the city would find the money.”


I
f Jett worked in Norwalk, a majority 
white town with a median house­
hold income of $89,486, he’d be making 
$64,355, according to a salary compar­
ison chart prepared by the New Haven 
teacher’s union. If he worked thirty 
minutes away in Westport, a city that 
is 86.5 percent white and where the 
median household income is $222,375, 
he’d make $77,721. In New Haven, 
where the median household income is 
$44,507, he makes only $50,440. A por­
tion of Jett’s modest paycheck goes back 
into his classroom.


To make up for the things his 
school can’t buy, Jett keeps his classroom 
stocked by spending his own money. 
While we were on the phone, Jett pulled 
up his Amazon purchase history for 
the last few months, going back to just 
before the school year started. Adding up 
the money that he spent on books, paper, 
pencils, markers, craft supplies, and 
toys demonstrating mathematical con­
cepts, Jett estimated that he spent close 
to $4,000 on supplies for his classroom 
this summer. What the school is able to 
provide often arrives after the year has 
started. Teachers who didn’t make sim­
ilar purchases sometimes begin the year 
without books. Baumann has experi­
enced these delays, and now buys most 
of the materials needed for experiments 
with his own money. All of the teachers 
I interviewed said they spend some of 
their own money on classroom supplies, 
but amounts ranged from a few hun­
dred dollars to Jett’s $4,000. Still, they
choose to stay.


W
hen asked if he has considered leav­
ing the district, Baumann said, “I 
think about it every day.” He knows sev­
eral teachers who have left just this year. 
Still, he plans to stay for the next year 
and a half until he retires: “I . . . honestly 
enjoy the eighth-grade team teachers 
that I’m working with, and I’m proba­
bly staying here more for them than for 
myself or the kids right now.”


Blatteau said, “Teachers who switch 
districts love New Haven, but I don’t 
blame them.”


Comulada agreed. “People need to 
feed their families, Maybe [leaving] is in 
their self-care bucket,” she said, acknowl­
edging also that pay across districts “isn’t 
an even-steven.”


Those teachers who do stay in New 
Haven remain excited about the district’s 
potential, and Blatteau said that “this isn’t 
a crisis without an answer.” The union’s 
current leadership is advocating for the 
things rank-and-file teachers want, like 
smaller class sizes and pay that adjusts 
to the rising cost of living. In prepara­
tion for the election, candidates—all of 
whom are teachers themselves—worked 
to increase member engagement in the 
union, responding to criticisms that 
there wasn’t enough information avail­
able about union activity.


Though he acknowledges that pay
and conditions are better at other 
schools, Jett said, “New Haven is one of 
the only districts in Connecticut where 
kids’ and families’ voices are heard, where 
we’re really trying to fix these problems.” 
Where other districts promised inclu­
sion but often fell short, in New Haven, 
“everyone’s doing their best to get kids 
up to where they need to be.” Still, as 
Blatteau and her colleagues in the union 
understand, teaching in New Haven is 
unsustainable for many teachers.


Things are looking up, though. In 
November, the city’s Board of Education 
approved a new teacher contract that 
will incrementally increase salaries over 
three years, according to the New Haven 
Register. In July of 2023, wages will 
increase 5.9 percent, then 4.9 percent the 
year after, and 3.9 percent the year after 
that. By the 2025–26 school 
year, the starting salary will 
be $51,421, compared to 
the current starting salary 
of $45,457. It’s an overdue 
improvement, but it might 
still not be enough.


“Teachers are the most 
unappreciated and under­
compensated [workers],” said Boroski. 
What’s more, New Haven teachers 
advocate for their students far beyond 
the classroom. Comulada recounted two 
trips to Massachusetts that she orga­
nized in 2019, rallying students and fel­
low teachers to support a student who 
had been detained by ICE.


Students 
leave 
Augusta 
Lewis 
Troup at 2:50 p.m.. Under the hum of 
fluorescent lights, Jett stows the mark­
ers and crayons, sorts early-reader books 
and chapter books into their separate 
bins, and reorganizes math manipula­
tives. He keeps the supplies his paycheck 
paid for in good shape. A mile away at 
the Cooperative Arts and Humanities 
High school, Boroski and Wetmore do 
their ritual clean-up as well: Wetmore 
puts away all of her art supplies so that 
a health teacher can use the room the 
following morning, while Boroski rolls 
up the projector screen that he bought
for his room. ∎

**Title: God the Mother, Ahn Sahng-hong, and the World Mission Society Church of God: A Yale Investigation**
**Author:  Not specified in provided text**
**Page number(s): 22-24**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Kelsey M. had just turned eighteen when she was approached on the way back to her dorm in Seattle by someone asking if she’d heard about “God the Mother.” Curious, she agreed to attend a Bible study the next day, at the end of which she was baptized.

When she was first approached, Kelsey was new to the area, having just moved for college. She had no family or friends in Seattle. The peo­ple who had invited her to attend a Bible study looked around her age and seemed friendly, so she decided to tag along.

In a matter of weeks, she was in so deep that she was prepared to “literally die for the Church.”

Kelsey was recruited during what the Church calls a “short-term mission”, in which members from Los Angeles are sent to cities like Seattle to preach for about a week and baptize as many people as possible. “Everything they said to me made logical sense, for example, because they believe in a God the Father and God the Mother, they said just as every living creature on this Earth requires a father and a mother to be given life, in the same way, we have to have a God the Father and the Mother to be given spiritual life,” Kelsey said. “They use a lot of real life examples to justify or explain their doctrine, to make it more digestible.”

During such missions, Kelsey told us, the recruitment process is “sped up,” which means important, secret tenants of the Church are divulged earlier than usual. Perhaps their most important belief is that their founder, a twenti­eth century minister named Ahn Sahng-hong, is the second coming of Christ. Many other members that we spoke to only learned about Ahn Sahng-hong after several months in the Church. What Kelsey did not learn right away, though, was that Ahn’s spiritual wife—a living South Korean woman named Zahng Gil-jah—is God the Mother. She was told this explicitly only after three years in the Church, by which time she was in so deep that she didn’t think to question it.

The church that Kelsey joined is known as the World Mission Society Church of God, a reli­gious Bible-based movement that was founded by Ahn Sahng-hong in South Korea in 1964. Kelsey told us that the Church teaches preaching members to only reveal its beliefs and practices bit by bit, because the more radical beliefs of the Church—such as the fact that God the Mother is very much alive—would “scare [newly recruited members] and they’re not going to want to listen to the truth.” The Church allegedly justifies this through a verse in 1 Corinthians that says, “I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it.”

Last spring, a division of the Church known as ASEZ, or Save the Earth from A to Z, sought to establish a student organization at Yale. We investigated ASEZ for the Yale Daily News in April of 2022 and spoke to ten students who attested to having been approached by members of the Church on campus, as well as a few who’d actu­ally joined. One student, Charnice, who joined for a few months, was told to miss class and other extracurriculars to focus on her “spiritual family.” Another student, Davornne, became a Freshman Counselor (FroCo) while actively involved in the Church, seemingly seeking to recruit the first year students in her group and missing crucial responsibilities to attend marathon bible sessions. At the time that we interviewed ASEZ, the group was spearheaded on campus by Davornne, who has since graduated, but from student reaction to the article, we learned that there was a wave of attempted recruitment from as early as 2018. The Church’s closest location is in Middletown, Connecticut, but over the last year, they have mainly invited students to Bible studies at the Starbucks on Chapel Street.


Yale students might recognize the group’s recruitment tactics from personal experi­ence. Usually in pairs, members of ASEZ would approach students in coffee shops or on the street between classes, asking if they’d want to join for Bible study. If the answer is no, a student might be subjected to a few minutes of earnest per­suasion before they’re left alone. If the answer is “sure”, they’ll likely be invited to a Bible study at the Starbucks on Chapel Street or a room in Bass Library. Students on other university cam­puses have described being loaded into a car and driven to a church building, where they’ll sit down with other members for hours of worship, at the end of which, usually, awaits an impromptu, Do-It-Yourself baptism in the church bathtub.


We were able to meet Kelsey, and many of the other sources in this article, through a small online community of ex-members-turned-vocal critics of the World Mission Society Church of God. Kelsey told us that the Church’s “target audience” is young adults aged between 18 and 30 years old. “Basically, anybody who is not tied down with a family and can just dedicate their entire free time to the advancement of recruitment for the group,” Kelsey said. “That was number one. That’s why you see them on a lot of college campuses.”


But the question of the legitimacy of the Church, which has been accused by former mem­bers of being a “cult,” and the intense, often unset­tling commitments it asks of its members, goes much deeper.


The Bible studies and church services that Kelsey attended were initially not held at a church, but at a member’s house. Every Saturday, she and other members would gather there from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. for three hour-long services, mean­ing that she was “constantly surrounded” by the same people. “When you start college, you’re very impressionable, everybody’s kind of trying to figure out the world around them at that time,” Kelsey said. “Everybody in the Seattle church at the time, we all just sat around one dinner table, so it was a bunch of people who had no family, no friends in the area . . . and we literally just became like a family.”


Things moved quickly for Kelsey. Her fellow members were all the friends she had in Seattle, and because she hadn’t previously read the Bible, she was quick to believe what they told her. For Kelsey, a lot of her first experiences in the Church weren’t immediate red flags—even if she was spending copious amounts of time at the church, it initially didn’t strike her as concerning. In fact, like all of the former members we spoke to, Kelsey described the tension between the Church as a toxic and controlling institution, and her fellow members being kind, friendly, and drawn to the Church for many of the same reasons as herself. This is what made it so hard for her, and others, to leave.


In July, we visited the New York City branch of the Church for their 3 p.m. service. We found the address on the internet, and at the front of the two-story office building was a sign that read “Ring the doorbell if the door is locked.” The door was not locked, so we entered through the glass doors into a makeshift waiting room with just an elevator. Certificates of philanthropic awards hung on the walls around the room. We stepped into the elevator to go up to the second floor, where the services were being held. But the elevator did not budge and the doors stayed open. After a couple of minutes, we stepped out and rang the doorbell—which had a Ring camera—outside the front door. Just then, the doors of the elevator closed.


As we debated calling the elevator again, the doors opened to reveal a tall man dressed in a gray suit. He began to question us: how did we know about the Church? Why were we there? Who’d invited us? Services were invite-only, we were told, for the protection of the members. It did not mat­ter that we had called a week earlier and been told that services were open to all by someone who subsequently stopped answering our calls. He instructed us to come back in half an hour for activities, when the service was over. So, we did. For the next thirty minutes, we sat kicking our legs on barstools at a restaurant next door, sweating in the New York City heat, debating our next move and guessing at what exactly “activities” might mean. But when we were let up to the sec­ond floor, there were now two men standing in front of the elevator door, barring our way. The second man, we found out, was Victor Lozado, the overseer of the New York and New Jersey branch. Members were being sent home early because of the heat wave, they said, so now was not a good time. It would be best if we could put our names down so they could contact us for a future Bible study. Members, all dressed in suits and blazers, despite the heat, streamed outside in twos and threes—but a few minutes later, they reentered the building through a door to the side of the main lobby. There was no indication that any of them were going home for the day.


The origins of the World Mission Society Church of God are more complicated than the Church makes them out to be. Searching for information about Ahn online leads to a deluge of mixed information. The blog Examining the wmscog is run by a former member who is ded­icated to unveiling the doctrines of the Church, and there are at least a dozen counter-blogs that attempt to hide and invalidate any criticisms of the Church. Googling “How can Ahn Sahng-hong be the Christ” brings up pages of those counter-blogs, like The True wmscog and The True God the Mother, in addition to the Church’s regional websites. But there is little information about the man himself.


From what we were able to find, Ahn Sahng-hong, a 46-year-old South Korean Christian min­ister, founded the Church in 1964 under the name Church of God Jesus Witnesses in Busan, South Korea. Born in the Jeollabuk-do province of South Korea in 1918, Ahn grew up in a Buddhist household. In 1946, he converted to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. According to the website for the World Mission Society Church of God in Korea, he began receiving revelations from God in 1953, and in 1956, Ahn predicted that there would be the second coming of Christ within the next decade. In 1962, he was excommunicated from the Seventh-day Adventists.


Ahn taught a literal interpretation of the Bible, something he felt the Christian Church had distorted. He believed that Christian ico­nography like symbols of the cross was a form of idolatry; that the Sabbath should be observed on Saturday, not Sunday; that women should wear head coverings while praying; and that humanity is living in the end times, when the end of the world is imminent. In his books, The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life and The Bridegroom Was a Long Time in Coming, and They All Became Drowsy and Fell Asleep, he predicted that the world would end forty years after the cre­ation of the modern state of Israel in 1988. After Ahn’s passing in 1985, the original church split into two separate sects: the New Covenant Passover Church of God, led in Busan by Ahn’s son, and the Church of God Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong. The latter, which was rebranded as the World Mission Society Church of God in 1997, was led by Zahng Gil-jah and the general pastor Kim Joo-cheol. While the New Covenant Passover Church of God believes that Ahn was just a prophet of God, the World Mission Society believes he is God himself—and they believe that Zang is Ahn’s “spiritual wife”, and God the Mother.


Zahng is an ever-smiling 79-year-old woman living in South Korea. According to a letter allegedly written by her first husband Kim Jae-hoon, Zahng and Kim were married in 1966 and began going to Ahn’s church together. They had two children, but as Zahng became more and more involved with the Church, she sold their house to pour money into the Church and began to neglect her family. Eventually, they separated in 1987.


George, whose name has been changed to protect the identities of his family members, was born into the Church and remained a member for twenty-one years. His parents married when his father served in the United States military in South Korea, and both of his parents initially joined the Church. While his mother was “indoc­trinated fast” and “very devout,” George said she still was not as “into it” as his father. His parents separated, and George has not seen his father in ten years. Based on his Linkedin, George believes his dad is now a missionary for the Church and works for the Red Cross.


George met Zahng at the main temple in South Korea, once with his father as a young child and later again with his mother as a teenager. Each time he met her, he believed fully that she was God. She was charismatic and maternal. After a service, she would sit alongside a transla­tor as a line of people came up to meet her. Often, George said, people would describe what they were struggling with in their lives.


The World Mission Society Church of God has been awarded with multiple philanthropic awards, as has Zahng herself. Her website, and the website of the WeLoveU Foundation she founded, describes her philanthropic ventures as evidence of “the Love of a Mother.” Members of the Church frequently participate in community service—receiving media cover­age almost every time—and the Church osten­sibly founded ASEZ as a means for university students to get involved with the service-side of the Church, without having to participate in the Church’s religion.


According to Anthony Forte—another for­mer member who joined the Church in 2011 and left in 2021—however, members of the Church are aware that ASEZ is what he called a “front group,” created just to recruit more members into the Church. He pointed out the contradic­tion between the Church believing the world is going to end any day now, and ASEZ carrying out environmental efforts that should, under this reli­gious belief, have no real effect on whether or not the world is saved. When members pointed this out to church leaders, Anthony said, they were reassured that “Save the Earth” meant to recruit the people of the Earth to their church to be saved, not the planet. ASEZ also gave the Church opportunities to legitimize itself, Anthony said, through photo opportunities and the collec­tion of awards from governments and official organizations for their hours conducting service. But Victor told us that this was ridiculous. He emphasized that ASEZ was created by university students in the Church who were only interested in furthering the Church’s service mission; they “wanted to bring what they learned in the Church, into their school,” he said.


“We cannot help people feeling like ‘Oh, but I have to join the Church’ [and that feeling] will keep them from helping even though they could,” Victor said. “So ASEZ was essentially that we want to bring the actual preaching to practice rather than directly preaching with the Bible.”


An email we obtained sent by Brittley Timmons, the administrator of the Church in Maryland, included a spreadsheet that described ASEZ activities as a method of building relation­ships, which is a key step in church recruitment.


Victor recognized us from our first article in the News. After we were asked to leave the Bronx church, he stepped outside and, seeing us, rattled off a list of reasons why the Church had to be wary of the media. A balanced perspective was all he was asking for, and that was something he said he would be willing to provide. He agreed to meet for an interview, initially suggesting a Starbucks in Manhattan, on the condition that we attend a Bible study first—something that he said all reporters were asked to do.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
After a month of back and forth, Victor 
offered to drive up to meet us at the Middletown 
church. Sitting at the back of a white and beige 
meeting room with several rows of seats, the pas­
tor of the Church, a tall, ever-smiling Korean 
man who later called himself the “selfie king,” 
brought out a tray of snacks. He set up a screen 
at the front of the room and began screening half 
an hour of videos about the Church including 
dozens of videos of church members across the 
world gathered in large groups, smiling, wav­
ing, and exclaiming “We love you!” As we were 
leaving, after asking us to take a selfie with him, 
the “selfie king” gave us goodie bags filled with 
baked goods, a mug inscribed with a Bible verse, 
and a note that ended with another “We love 
you.” Victor’s story is familiar. He first joined the 
Church as a 20-year-old college student in 2005 
in Bogota, New Jersey. He was invited to a Bible 
study after soccer practice. He said he’d tried 
out several churches prior to joining the World 
Mission Society, but found that many churches 
did not “practice what they preached,” including 
the Catholic church in which he grew up. Once 
he saw the “evidence” from the Bible about the 
Sabbath, he knew the Church of God was “dif­
ferent”. (The evidence: Mark 16:1 states “Saturday 
evening, when the Sabbath ended.”)


Victor was baptized a few days after his first 
Bible study.


Ava, whose name has been changed to pro­
tect her identity, is a former member who was 
in the Church for about two months. She, like 
Kelsey, was baptized at her first Bible study, 
but she had not been told almost anything 
about the Church’s beliefs. According to Kelsey, 
once you are baptized by the Church, you’re
considered a member.


When the World Mission Society first 
approached her, Ava had just graduated college. 
Two women around her age approached her in 
the Christian aisle of a bookstore. At the time, 
she had been interested in learning more about 
Christianity, so when the women asked her to 
join them for a Bible study, she agreed to go the 
next day, despite the women urging her to follow 
them into a car immediately.


When she went to the Church, Ava noticed 
photos of Zahng on the walls and accepted 
their explanation that that was God the Mother. 
Looking back, she chalks this up to naivety. At 
the end of the Bible study, she was taken to a 
separate room of the house with a tub, where 
she was submerged underwater. “It seemed like a 
normal Bible study, nothing out of the ordinary,” 
she said. “I liked what I heard, so they asked me 
if I wanted to get baptized, and that’s something
I actually regret.”


The feeling of regret kept coming up 
throughout our conversation with Ava. She had 
joined the Church and allowed herself to be bap­
tized because she was genuinely interested in 
Christianity. Later, she learned that the Christian 
leaders condemn World Mission Society as a 
cult, and this made her wonder if she had tainted 
herself. “I regretted [the baptism] very much. I 
felt like what have I done? How did I ruin my 
chances to get to heaven?” Baptizing members 
before they’re devoted is a way to make them feel 
committed to the Church quickly. At the time, 
though, she believed the group when they told 
her she had to be baptized in order to see salva­
tion, so that Saturday she returned to the house 
for World Mission Society’s day of sabbath where 
they worshiped and studied the Bible nonstop—
it felt like “cramming for an exam.” Everyone was 
cooped up in the house from morning until night, 
breaking only for meals.


“We spent the entire day at that house and it 
was exhausting,” Ava said in an almost confes­
sionary tone. She felt almost guilty that she had 
allowed herself to be baptized, and kept apol­
ogizing for how “ignorant” she had been about 
religion at the time. “I’m going to be honest with 
you, it’s an experience I’ve never experienced 
before. At the end of that day, it felt like a phys­
ical change happening, like [my brain] was being 
reworked and reformed.”


Over time, however, questions began to pop 
up. She had contributed to gifts and monetary 
donations for “the heavenly mother” in South 
Korea, and the Church had played a “thank you” 
message from God the Mother at the next service. 
Ava wondered why, if the woman in South Korea 
was God, she only responded by nodding and 
smiling, and could not respond in English. She’d 
also seen mentions of Ahn Sahng-hong as the 
second coming of Christ on the internet—some­
thing the Church hadn’t mentioned to her at all—
which she brought up at one of the Bible studies. 
To each of her questions, Ava said she was only 
told by the members conducting the Bible study 
that she was “ignorant,” “dumb,” and should not 
have “read ahead.”


She eventually left and joined a Methodist 
church. She told us that she wants to get re-bap­
tized to “wash away” what happened. She felt 
“betrayed” by the two women from the bookstore, 
whom she had considered her friends.


Kelsey, too, described her baptism as an 
uncomfortable experience.


“They didn’t tie my hands and throw me into 
a bathtub,” Kelsey said. “But the thing is, I don’t 
believe that I had the information necessary to 
really make the choice on my own, because they 
were not forthcoming with all the stuff that was 
going to be required of me.” Both Kelsey and 
Ava told us that the intimate space where their 
baptisms took place and the group of people that 
surrounded them made them feel pressured to 
agree to the baptism. “They tell you in order to be 
saved and enter the kingdom of heaven, you have 
to be baptized and they show a verse in the Bible 
that says you don’t know what’s going to hap­
pen tomorrow,” Kelsey added. “So there’s some
element of fear tactics as well.”

Anthony recalled being similarly baptized 
at his first Bible study. He felt like he had been 
misled. He was not religious at all before joining 
the Church, did not have any experience and had 
little knowledge of baptism, and was told that he 
would just “get a little wet.” Instead, he was led 
to a room where he was asked to take off all his 
clothes and change into a robe. He kneeled down 
while a group of about five people prayed over 
him—it felt like a “whirlwind.”


“In my mind, it was a ceremony where maybe 
they sprinkle water and then that’s really the end 
of it,” Anthony said. “But they ended up making 
me walk up to a room, where they told me I had 
to take off all my clothes and put on a robe and 
I felt like that was deceptive . . . But I already felt 
this peer pressure, these people are all excited and 
surrounding me excited that I’m going to be bap­
tized . . . what am I supposed to do?”


Victor told us that the immediacy of baptism 
within the Church is based on their commitment 
to following the Bible. “In the Bible, every bap-
tism was immediate. There is no record of a
baptism being delayed by six months or a year, so 
it is taught in the Bible that if someone wants to 
be baptized, they can do it the same day.”


A
t the end of November, a month after we’d 
sat down with Victor, we wrote him with 
a list of the allegations former members had 
brought forward—allegations that had “legal 
implications” according to his reply. The next 
day, we received an email with fifty member 
testimonies attached as letters mostly addressed 
to “whom it may concern.” These letters, fea­
turing the writers’ first and last names, detailed 
their positive experiences with the Church. In 
Victor’s words, “with over 4,000,000 members 
worldwide everyone has different experiences, 
and to write a story about our Church only from 
the perspective of “former members,” its unfair 
to all the members who currently attend the 
Church, and whose lives have improved since 
having joined the Church.”


A member of the Church for seventeen 
years, Zuley Polanco, described how her hus­
band, whom she had met while at college, even­
tually began attending the Church with her. “We 
got married and for a long time I attended the 
Church of God alone which was never a problem 
but I still wanted him to be a part of this beau­
tiful organization,” she wrote. “So, I invited him 
to one of the many events held at the church 
and he was very impressed by how much the 
Church of God does for the community and the
countries around the world.”


Another member, Youngbae Song, who has 
attended the Church since 2007, wrote that the 
Church helped him to understand the “impor­
tance” of keeping God’s commands: “I realized 
that no other churches I attended were actually 
following the teachings of God in the bible, but 
practice many pagan customs.”


Youngbae described how the Catholic mother 
of one member called her daughter and decided 
to visit the Church because her Catholic priest 
had said to their parish: “if you want to believe 
in God, you should be like the members of the 
Church of God.”


“It is a miracle!” Youngbae wrote. “Many co 
workers and family members came to Church of 
God because they realized how much the mem­
bers who attended had changed for the better 
after attending the church.”


Many of the other testimonies read with the 
same zeal, describing how the Church changed 
members for the better, and that their spiritual 
change compelled friends and family to attend 
too. Many of them describe their former selves, 
before joining the Church, as selfish or lost; after 
joining the Church, Ivan Diaz wrote that he 
began helping out around the house and became 
a more positive person. Several mention finding 
the “truth”—sometimes with a capital “T”—
through the Church. Although the accounts 
represent the variety of experiences within the 
Church—many of which, according to Victor, 
dispute the claims of former members—there 
are some elements that connect the testimo­
nies to each other and to those of former mem­
bers. The recruitment that Kelsey, Anthony, and 
George describe is reminiscent of Pablo Chavez, 
who “could not help but to invite” his family, 
friends, coworkers, and classmates to the Church 
and Naomi Timmons who realized that “every­
one must know about and come to this church!” 
Time spent at the Church that would stretch 
past midnight each day is described by Saira 
Ahmed as the Church becoming her “home”—
“Day after day, no one needed to call me to ask 
if I was coming,” she wrote. Many described 
being disillusioned with other religions before 
finding the Church. Several of the members 
described having a family while in the Church, 
children who would attend Bible studies and 
Sabbath days and eventually begin preaching to 
others. Several of them described having spouses 
who weren’t originally in the Church—but all 
of them either ended up joining or separating, 
although one describes another member who is 
not a member of the Church. A few of them did 
describe learning about God the Mother early 
on. Several of the testimonies, like Jaewon Kim’s 
and Jenn Garcia’s, also describe joining the 
Church while in college, although they empha­
size that the Church did not interfere with their 
studies or extracurriculars.


One member, Ashley, graduated from Yale in 
May 2018 and worked at Yale from 2018 to 2020. 
While she was at Yale, she was not particularly 
interested in the Church, being more focused on 
her academic and professional goals. She recalled 
being introduced to the Church through two 
girls who approached her and her roommate at 
a mall: had she heard that the second coming 
of Christ had already come, they asked her. Not 


understanding the name “Ahn Sahng-hong,” she 
asked them to repeat it four times before feel­
ing “relieved” to learn that the reason she couldn’t 
understand it was because it was Korean. After 
a few Bible studies, Ashley was baptized—a rite 
in order for her to “keep the Passover and receive 
the promise of God.” The Church taught her that 
many of the things she thought she knew were 
not biblical: “I felt so hurt by all those churches 
that taught me those things that had nothing to 
do with what God commanded us. I felt lied to 
and I wanted to know the truth.”



The Church calls new recruits, people who 
attend at least one Bible study, “fruits.”


“Bearing fruit,” Kelsey said, meant bringing 
somebody to the Church who then gets baptized, 
and each fruit that a member “bears” earns them 
points at the main Church in South Korea. If a 
fruit begins contributing monetarily—through 
tithes and offerings—they are then called a “talent.”


Tom, whose name has been changed for pri­
vacy reasons, became involved almost seven years 
ago as a senior in high school when he was mes­
saged by a coworker he liked, asking if he would 
come to the Church of God. He didn’t think 
much of it, and saw it as an opportunity to get to 
know the girl and thought it could be interest­
ing. He said he found the people the Church uses 
for recruiting are either young college students
or attractive women.


About a week after she messaged him, he 
went to the Church, then only stayed in the 
Church for a few months, but he could already 
tell that something wasn’t right. 


Tom said the Bible studies seemed normal 
at first, although he did not have much religious 
experience, but he said things started becoming 
“weird” and “strange,” especially with the long 
church services and how he found members of 
the Church were “out of touch with reality” and 
“brainwash[ed].” 


They also encouraged him to not talk to peo­
ple who did not agree with the Church’s ideas, 
which he also found strange, and said they would 
“do anything they [could]” to get him to stay late 
at the services, leading him to often lie and tell 
leaders he was sick to get out of commitments 
for the Church.


“They don’t strike me as somebody that would, 
you know, hurt you physically, but they will do 
anything necessary to mentally convince you to 
stay,” Tom said.


I
n 2010, Kelsey said that the Church taught 
that the world would end in 2012 and that each 
member had to bring in ten talents in order to 
ensure their place in heaven. The Church called 
this the “ten talents movement.”


“It was so incredibly stressful, and meanwhile 
2012 passes and they said, ‘Mother’s giving us 
more time to bear the ten talents,’” Kelsey said. 
“2012 comes and goes and we’re still here, and the 
Church backtracks and says, ‘We never taught 
that the end of the world was going to happen.’” 
(Members had been taught to physically prepare 
for the end of the world by buying an army duf­
fle bag, a month’s worth of food, and a month’s 
worth of water.) But the Church was still expect­
ing its members to recruit.


The Church, allegedly, would simply move 
the date of destruction further back. 2014, the fif­
tieth anniversary of the Church, was the next date, 
and when that passed, they said the world would 
end in 2018. They stressed that members should 
be ready for the world to end at any moment, and 
they should prepare by devoting themselves com­
pletely to the Church.


“If Father comes tonight, you want to be 
found doing the gospel work,” Kelsey said. “They 
had it in your mind that Ahn Sahng-hong could 
come back at any moment and destroy the whole 
world, and they would tell us that you need to 
be prepared to watch your children die in front

of you and still be faithful.” Kelsey felt that to 
be prepared she had to be constantly preaching, 
studying the Bible, or doing work for the Church.

Kelsey and other former members recounted 
frequent offerings that were required by members, 
including a tithe of 10 percent of your annual pre-
tax income. Victor emphasized the importance of 
a tithe as a biblical teaching, but said there is “free 
will” with every teaching of God, explaining that 
the tithe is not enforced. After all, he said, God 
wants a “cheerful giver.”

A 10 percent tithe is described in the Bible 
in Deuteronomy and is also required by some 
churches including the Seventh-day Adventists 
and the Church of Latter-day Saints, but is vol­
untary for the most part in other churches in
the United States. 

Kelsey, however, told a different story.
“They say they don’t require anybody to tithe, 
and that’s a lie,” Kelsey said. “When I first joined, 
all I was required [to give] was tithes and offer­
ings . . . but the more I got involved in the Church, 
the more that they started asking me for.”

Eventually, half of Kelsey’s salary was going 
to the Church. She was purchasing lights for the 
building, cooking for the whole congregation 
twice a month, and, when she became a leader in 
the Portland branch, she was spending an addi­
tional $250 to $300 a month to provide meals on 
sabbath days for up to 120 regular members. If 
there were seminars, construction at the Church, 
or materials needed for the children’s classes, 
Kelsey also had to front the cost. “It got to the 
point where by the time I left the Church, roughly 
40 to 50 percent of my paycheck was going to the 
Church every month,” she said.

When asked about members like Kelsey hav­
ing to spend large sums of money, Victor said, “I 
don’t know what that means.” 

Anthony also recalled having to give large 
sums of money. He said every time you receive a 
paycheck, you were told to tithe 10 percent of your 
pre-tax income and “always round up” if there was 
change involved. There would be an offering on 
Saturday at each of the three services, and once a 
month, there would be a “brown envelope” which 
goes to international churches or towards plan­
ning for church missions and included a “thank 
offering” that members contribute to once a 
month. In addition to these donations to the 
Church, they also have “the feasts of God” which 
are special celebrations involving at least seven­
teen different ceremonies throughout the year, 
each of which requires extra donations in two 
offerings per service, on top of food donations or 
donations towards specific events.

“I’m sure that some of it goes towards the 
upkeep of the building, but even when they do 
construction work, a lot of the time the members 
are just contributing more and more,” Anthony 
said. “So it seems limitless, how much they ask the 
members to give, and you don’t really see where 
it goes. It seems like they just take tithes and 
offerings and they completely put it aside, and 
then the members continue to feed into upkeep­
ing the building and the food and everything like 
that to keep it sustained. Typically, you’d see the 
tithe go towards that, but it doesn’t.”

Tom said church leaders would ask for dona­
tions and give members a week to provide the do- 
nation. In his case, he donated around $300 in total.


O
n George’s second visit to the main tem­
ple in Korea, he and his mother, like other 
members, lined up to meet Zahng after the 
service. When it came time for his mother and 
him to go up, George was confused. Without 
George saying anything, the translator described 
to Zahng his struggles with drug abuse, and 
about how his father had stopped sending child 
support to them, and her face dropped. “It was 
the weirdest thing,” he said, stunned by the fact 
that the translator knew and was sharing such 
sensitive information about him with someone 
who—as God—he assumed would already know 
everything. These were things he had only told 
his church leader back home, under the assump­
tion that it was confidential. He later found out 
that the Church reported his situation to the 
elder of the Church, who then passed it onto 
the headquarters in South Korea. He felt “vio­
lated” and disturbed that his intimate struggles 
were being openly discussed, just so that Zahng 
could tell him “everything’s gonna be alright,
it will get better.”


George said that the Church frequently 
shared such sensitive information without mem­
bers’ consent. He told us that the same thing hap­
pened to some of his friends in the Church who 
were conflicted about their sexuality, or were in 
relationships that weren’t ordained. The Church 
would tell George that God the Mother knew 
these things, because she is all-knowing, but 
when he questioned why Zahng even needed a 
translator, the deacon at his church in California 
told him that she’s God in human form, and 
that in the same way, Jesus had physical aspects 
that made other people doubt and crucify him. 
They would tell him that he shouldn’t ques­
tion those things, because “God’s thoughts are
higher than ours.”

Still, Zahng’s generosity isn’t fiction. During 
George’s visit to Korea with his mother, he 
learned that the Church had given his father 
$5,000 for child support—because he had refused 
to on his own—and the Church wanted to fix 
that relationship and ensure his father, a mis­
sionary for the Church, wouldn’t lose face. But 
George and his mother never got the money; 
they never even knew it existed until Zahng 
asked him about it. Zahng ended up giving 
them $2,000 in a brown envelope, which George 
felt was like an “emotional investment.” He 
was conflicted, because he was grateful for the 
money and still steadfast in his beliefs, but the 
money also made him feel even more tied to the

Church, like he was indebted for something that
he was actually owed.

“It was a very hard moment to know that he 
used that money from the Church,” George said. 
“I don’t know what it was for, maybe he just gave 
it back to the Church, but I felt very manipulated 
after finding out that she gave me $2,000 and 
gave $5,000 to my dad, but she’s just recycling our 
tithes and offerings so that they could keep us in.”

T
he Church’s presence on campus isn’t new. 
After our first article in May, we learned 
that students have been approached on campus 
since as early as 2018. One Yale student wrote 
on Twitter that she was approached during her 
first year in 2018. Although she wasn’t alone, the 
Church members ignored her friend who is a 
man, focusing all their attention on her. After 
she explained to them that she was a practicing 
Muslim and was not interested in “expanding” her 
views, she wrote, they tried to tell her that God 
the Mother “worked under all major religions.”

The members had told her that they were 
Yale Divinity School students and were trying to 
form an official club on campus. We weren’t able 
to identify any current or former students at Yale, 
besides Davornne and Ashley, who are members 
of the Church. 

Another student wrote that he was “followed” 
from Cross Campus back to Bingham Hall in his 
first year by members of the Church. “I had to run 
into the entryway to escape,” he wrote.

Outside of Yale, ASEZ has chapters at the 
University of Connecticut, Antelope Valley 
College, Indiana University-Purdue University 
Indianapolis (IUPUI), New York University, Old 
Dominion University, Bronx Community College, 
and Lehman College. 

The chapter at the University of Connecticut 
holds active meetings, including “paint and plant” 
events, game nights, and general body meetings. 
The other college chapters nationwide are often 
highlighted for their service work by local news 
outlets, including planting trees or cleaning up 
local areas.

G
eorge moved back to the United States as 
a child and grew up attending one of the 
Church locations in California. “It was a part of 
my whole childhood,” George said. “Everyone 
that I knew in the Church would be considered 
family. I didn’t know anything else. I didn’t know 
how other services went at other churches or just 
how normal people outside my church acted.”

Each Saturday, the children would be brought 
to a separate room, while the adults went for ser­
vices. “It wasn’t a good place for kids to strive and 
it’s very depressing, all we do is study the Word 
of God. But it was back to back, and we were just 
kids,” George said.

Sealed away in a room all day, he would learn 
to recite “Mother’s Teachings” which were Zahng 
Gil-jah—God the Mother’s—thirteen teachings. 
For as long as their parents were in the services or 
Bible studies, the children were studying the teach­
ings. This sometimes meant that they were there 
from 9 a.m., when the first service began, to around 
9 or 10 p.m., when the third service ended, with
just short breaks to go outside or eat. “We never 
had time to sleep,” George recalled. “If we slept, we 
would be woken up. We’re never able to close our
eyes, we’d have to always be looking at the Bible.”

Kelsey, for a time, was in charge of teach­
ing children on Sabbath days. She taught a 
group of children ages 3 to 15 for the entire day
every Saturday.

“5-year-olds, I had to teach them how to find 
the verses in the Bible and then repeat the sub­
jects and test them,” Kelsey said. “Children were 
expected to bring their classmates, their teachers, 
their friends and families [into the Church].”

Kelsey added that at the end of the day, she 
would meet with other members of leadership 
and was expected to divulge any issues or prob­
lems her students were facing, including things 
said to her in confidence.

As her role in the Church ramped up, Kelsey 
found that she was committing every moment 
outside of work to the Church. Everyday after 
work, she would be at the Church or around cam­
puses preaching until around 10 p.m., then after 
getting back home, she would study for another 
two hours, and the next day she would do it all 
over again.

“There were no days off, absolutely no days,” 
Kelsey said. “I lost every single friend I ever had.”

he Church’s hold on its members extended 
to anything that was considered “earthly”—
anything that might take you away from your 
heavenly family. That meant non-religious music, 
movies, sports, and internet use were discouraged; 
work was largely thought of as a means to better 
contribute towards the Church; and connections 
with family, friends, and romantic partners had to 
center the Church.

Less than a year after Anthony joined the 
Church, a head pastor had asked him how he 
was doing. ”You should be thinking about a fam­
ily,” he said, suggesting that he marry a member

Anthony had previously heard rumors about 
arranged marriages, but felt thrown off-guard. 
When he told the pastor that he hadn’t given it 
any thought before, the leader of the Church told 
him to “look around” and tell them who he liked. 
“They say that if you get married, you have a lot 
more opportunity to be blessed by God,” Anthony 
said. Anthony ended up marrying a woman the 
pastor first suggested in October of 2012, a year 
and three months after joining the Church and 
just a few months after their first date. They had 
met before, but never really spoken, and after four 
months, they went to different locations. After 
only two dates, they were told they had to decide 
whether or not they would marry each other.

Anthony told us he’d been asked to relocate 
multiple times over the decade that he was in the 
Church. That, in addition to the late hours spent 
at the Church—sometimes staying up until 1 or 
2 a.m.—meant that it was difficult to maintain a 
stable career. In 2012, he lost a job he had worked 
for six years—he started messing up at work 
because of the late nights. Once he found a new 
job, the Church told him it was time to be married. 
On the day of his wedding, the pastor told him 
that he and his wife should move to Florida, but 
he never gave Anthony an explicit reason. Moving 
to Florida meant that he’d have to give up his new 
job, spend some time finding new work, and—
because he went from a management position to 
an administrative position—live on half his previ­
ous wages. But he did it, because the Church told 
him to. He relocated three more times after that 
with his wife. They stayed married for nine years.

“We went through a lot of ups and downs, 
especially at the beginning, getting used to being 
married to a stranger,” Anthony said. “Looking 
back, being married out of fear, and out of the 
fear of condemnation, it definitely feels wrong 
for both of us. I feel like to have an expectation 
for somebody to marry a stranger . . . and doing it 
under threat, it’s kind of hard to express, because, 
in essence, you just feel like you’re forced to be in 
this intimate relationship with somebody that you 
haven’t chosen . . . Ultimately, you’re only doing it 
because you’re obedient to the Church.”

“Let me ask you this,” Victor said when we 
asked him if the Church conducted arranged 
marriages, smirking. “Let’s say you and I, we go 
to a party, and I introduce you to a friend of mine. 
‘I think maybe you guys can make a cute couple, 
you want to get to know him?’ Would you say
I’m arranging a marriage?”

Victor was introduced to his wife, who is 
Korean, by his pastor in 2009. They were married 
a year later. “I got to know her, and we went on 
a date, and we went on a few dates, we dated for 
some time, and then we decided to get married.”

Kelsey said that the Church showed mem­
bers a verse in the Old Testament that said that 
Jews should not mingle with gentiles, in order to 
justify why members should only marry within 
the Church. “In the same way we are spiritual 
Jews, and we don’t need to mingle with the people 
of the outside world,” she said.

K
elsey left the Church in 2017, ten years after 
joining. The process of leaving was difficult 
for her, because by that point she was utterly con­
vinced that the end of the world was approach­
ing. She left, not because she stopped believing 
in the Church, but because she was so burnt out 
from its demands that she realized she physically 
wasn’t able to keep going. She had been told that 
she was “lazy” and “wasn’t working hard enough.” 
The reason her parents died, church authorities 
said, was because she wasn’t preaching as much 
as she should be.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Having spoken to former and current mem­
bers, that sense of deception is certainly there, but 
it’s hard to define. People are baptized almost 
immediately, but not all of them later regret 
it. Members learn about Ahn Sahng-hong and 
Zahng Gil-jah at different stages. And although 
the Church’s members are responsible for bring­
ing people in, no individual member is at fault for 
the way the Church eventually strips its members 
dry of their money, time, and autonomy. Victor, 
the spokesperson of the Church, welcomed us 
into the Church at Middletown without hesi­
tation, but he was also quick to shut down any 
complaints from former members that we shared 
with him. We got the sense that that was the 
kind of denial members were met with when they
raised questions.


College campuses have long been attractive 
to alleged cult organizations: the Moonies, the 
cult of Sarah Lawrence, Shincheonji. College 
students are often open-minded, but also at their 
most vulnerable—far from home and looking for 
a sense of community.


In 2018, the University of Memphis banned 
ASEZ from its campus because of its aggressive 
preaching practices. But other universities, like 
the University of Washington, feel that preach­
ing falls within freedom of speech, and instead 
just advise students to research online or ask a 
friend or advisor before joining something new. 
Yale administrators did not respond in time to a 
request for comment, so what Yale might choose 
to do, if anything, is unclear. This semester, there’s 
been a marked absence of ASEZ’s presence on 
campus—perhaps because the last known student 
to be a member of it has graduated—but dotted 
around campus are people handing out flyers for 
other churches, or sitting quietly besides maga­
zine stands of church pamphlets propped up on 
the street. It’s hard not to wonder what differenti­
ates these groups from ASEZ.


For now, though, and perhaps indefinitely, 
Kelsey will continue to be haunted by the pros­
pect of the world’s collapse and her condemna­
tion by a woman living in South Korea. ∎
—Miranda Jeyaretnam is a junior
in Pierson College. Sarah Cook is a
sophomore in Grace Hopper College.
Her father’s death brought her some clar­
ity. He had a stroke, and his family, after days 
spent living with the possibility of him never 
returning to consciousness, made the decision to 
take him off of life support. The day the proce­
dure was meant to happen coincided with one 
of the Church’s feasts, but she was told she still 
had to be at the Church that day. “Even though 
I told them my dad’s dying in the hospital, and 
this is the day that they’re going to pull the 
plug,” Kelsey said. “They said, ‘Let the dead bury
their own dead.’”


But by that point, ten years in, the decision 
to leave the Church wasn’t easy. For one thing, 
all of her friends were in the Church, and while 
the Church as an organization is “toxic,” she 
said, the people you interact with on a daily basis 
are kind people who just got “caught up in this 
mess.” She was torn between wanting to leave, 
and believing that if she left she would be con­
demned to hell. She decided to take a break from 
the Church, but when she didn’t show up for one 
service, she was bombarded with texts asking 
where she was and if she was okay, and apolo­
gizing for not having paid enough attention to 
her. She found out that members of her church 
had circled her sister’s apartment block, looking 
for her car. When they showed up to her work, 
lying to get through security, she decided she had 
to take a formal break. She did her research and 
confronted the pastor with questions she knew 
he couldn’t answer. The nail in the coffin: why 
did the Church claim that its founder was pas­
tor Kim Joo-cheol, and not God the Father Ahn 
Sahng-hong, on its religious non-profit forms to 
the Internal Revenue Service?


Still, it took several months for Kelsey to 
stop believing in the Church’s doctrine. Five 
years on, she continues to have apocalyptic night­
mares, dreams where she is being burned alive or 
has to watch people burn up around her. She has 
been told by friends and family that she has some 
form of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and she 
still struggles to find joy in doing things that 
don’t have a purpose connected to the Church, 
like watching TV, watching movies, or listening 
to music.


“I struggle every single day because of this 
church,” Kelsey said. “The Church taught for the 
longest time that if you ever leave the Church 
of God, you will die, and you will die a horrible 
death. So whenever something bad happens, that 
always comes into my mind, even though I know 
that what they did is wrong.”


I
n the months since our first article, we’ve wres­
tled with the question of what makes some­
thing a cult, and what makes a cult dangerous, as 
opposed to just different. We previously spoke to 
Steven Hassan, a cult expert, about the difference 
between ethical cults and unethical or destructive 
cults. The key difference, he said, lies in whether 
or not members are deceived into joining.

A New Haven family center is on a mission to provide free

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Most of the symbolism in the office of In Our 
Blessed Mother’s Arms (IOBMA), a family center 
in New Haven, falls into two categories: babies 
and the Biblical.

First, the religious decor. Scattered around 
on surfaces and shelves, there are the miniatures: 
figurines of the pope, an angel, a nativity scene, a 
friar. Virgin Mary statues—white-glazed, gold, 
ivory, and blue—tower by comparison. One
is knee-high. 
The baby paraphernalia, on the other hand, 
is more life-sized: there’s a baby-sized baby doll 
for a baby to play with, fetus-sized fetus dolls that 
are handed out to potential clients on the street, a 
brochure illustration of “a tiny person—his actual 
size and appearance . . .” in the womb. On the walls, 
there’s a variety of babies of different races on 
posters inscribed with messages like Life is Precious, 
Celebrate Life! and Babies are Blessing Choose Life! 
And in photographs populating a corkboard,
there are the babies of IOBMA’s clientele.

From the outside, the office building could 
be mistaken for someone’s home: yellow siding, a 
rust-painted stoop with a little fleur-de-lis carved 
into the awning, ruched sheer curtains frozen 
behind the glass. Instead, it houses a dentist’s 
office on the first floor and IOBMA on the second. 
The next door neighbors—the New Haven Fire 
Department to the right, a white-pillar mansion 
on the left—appear less cozy. Together, the trio 
makes for an unlikely group: a place to deal with 
fire, a place to live in grandeur, and a place to deal 
with a pregnancy.


Ivana Solsbery, the owner and Director of the 
family center, sat at her desk, still recovering from 
her twice-weekly, two-hour prayer session outside 
New Haven’s Planned Parenthood. Just out the 
window across from her, on the other side of the 
street, Planned Parenthood’s THESE DOORS 
STAY OPEN banner drifted in the breeze.

Set against the nationally recognizable 
shadow of Planned Parenthood and the lib­
eral landscape of Connecticut, In Our Blessed 
Mother’s Arms seems like an obscure outpost. 
But there are similar sites found all over the coun­
try, most commonly known as crisis pregnancy 
centers. Their definitions generally circle the 
Guttmacher Institute’s, which describes them as 
“organizations that provide counseling and other 
prenatal services from an antiabortion (prolife) 
perspective.” They have a few analogous labels—
including pregnancy resource centers, limited 
pregnancy service centers, pregnancy care clinics, 
or, more pejoratively, fake health clinics. IOBMA is 
a reflection of this naming tedium: Solsbery and 
the center’s website call it a family center, but its 
Facebook page says it’s a “Pregnancy Resource 
and Outreach Center.” It offers services that 
many crisis pregnancy centers offer—and then 
some—and serves mostly pregnant clients. Like

other centers, it does not provide referrals for 
abortion, and its website has a disclaimer that it’s 
“not a pro-abortion organization.”


IOBMA doesn’t operate like all crisis preg­
nancy centers in the country—by nature, they 
are varied and shifting. Beyond its relatively 
obscure appearance, IOBMA is functionally a hum­
ble operation, too: it’s a one-woman-show that 
usually helps just a couple pregnant clients at a 
time, offering resources and supplies to help cli­
ents through pregnancy and childrearing. IOBMA 
doesn’t compete with Planned Parenthood 
because it doesn’t offer abortion services, and 
perhaps it even helps supplement the clinic’s 
family services. But Planned Parenthood’s recog­
nizability helps IOBMA more. It helps IOBMA
help others.


**Title: A State of Crisis**
**Page number(s): 35-36**

Many of today’s crisis pregnancy centers present 
as legitimate clinics. But they lack the medical 
licensing and regulations, such as federal privacy 
laws, that health facilities are bound by. They don’t 
support abortion. If they mention abortion as a 
pregnancy option with clients, they don’t provide 
referrals—though that caveat isn’t always clear 
in their messaging. They often offer a swath of 
useful services for free, like pregnancy tests, ultra­
sounds, and basic supplies like diapers, cribs, and 
baby clothes. But these services can come at a cost, 
such as false information about pregnancy and 
the risks of abortion, required parenting course­
work in exchange for free services, the failure to 
provide diagnoses or accurate readings of ultra­
sounds, and, crucially, clients’ time—with the 
potential consequence of delaying prenatal care, 
sometimes until it’s too late for a legal abortion 
to be an option. 

Tracing back to the sixties, these clinics 
have historically served clients who are primar­
ily low-income, young, and people of color with 
friendliness, family services that address some 
of their clients’ real needs, and a medical posture 
to boot. They have a legacy of persuading clients 
to carry their pregnancies to term with white 
women at their helm.

Abortion has been legal in Connecticut since 
1990. But, in anticipation of the overturning of 
Roe v. Wade this June, Connecticut enshrined 
legal protections for out-of-state abortion seek­
ers. Those provisions were set in May, just a few 
weeks after the Dobbs decision was leaked, in 
House Bill 5414, which also expanded the pool of 
providers who can perform abortions and short­
ened abortion wait times to two weeks. This bill 
now makes Connecticut one of two “safe har­
bor” states in the country, alongside New York, 
which passed similar legislation in June. One 
Connecticut abortion clinic—Hartford GYN 
Center in Bloomfield—has since seen patients 
come from states as far as Ohio, Tennessee, and 
Texas, according to Roxanne Sutocky, the clinic’s 
Director of Community Engagement.

Across the US, estimates of the number of cri­
sis pregnancy centers range anywhere from 1,500 
to 5,000—the data isn’t reported by states, the 
centers, or otherwise collected in a streamlined 
way. We at least know that they vastly outnumber 
the 807 abortion clinics in the US reported by the 
Guttmacher Institute. That imbalance will grow 
as the number of clinics continues to shrink post-
Roe and the demand for crisis pregnancy centers 
subsequently grows. In Connecticut, there are at 
least twenty crisis pregnancy centers, compared to 
fifteen licensed abortion clinics.

A given crisis pregnancy center might have 
a few revenue streams: donations, national 
anti-abortion organizations that fund and direct 
thousands of affiliate centers, and—though not 
in Connecticut—state tax dollars. Nationwide, 
crisis pregnancy centers receive five times more 
funding than legitimate abortion funds and clin­
ics. They’re typically 501(c)(3) nonprofits, which 
means they qualify for federal income tax-exemp­
tions, and their tax returns don’t have to be public. 
This means they can often offer their services for 
free. Many centers open locations near abortion 
clinics, college campuses, and in low-income 
neighborhoods.

Roxanne Sutocky told me that, between 
the network of abortion clinics she works with 
in Connecticut as a Community Engagement 
Director for The Women’s Centers (which 
includes Hartford GYN), patients tend to encoun­
ter crisis pregnancy centers in some capacity 
before coming into contact with a legitimate 
clinic. In part, that’s because they are some of 
the top hits that come up when you search terms 
online related to pregnancy or abortion options in 
Connecticut. “We hear people coming to us and 
regurgitating the misinformation that we hear 
from anti-abortion centers,” she said. “It’s unfor­
tunate because, for many people, it’s very unclear 
to them that the person that they’re engaging 
with or the website that they’re looking at is actu­
ally an anti-abortion entity.”

In Greater New Haven alone, there are 
at least four crisis pregnancy centers besides 
IOBMA—there’s Mary and Joseph’s Place in 
North Haven; Birthright of Greater New Haven 
in Hamden; Carolyn’s Place Pregnancy Care 
Center located across the street from Waterbury 
Hospital; and Saint Gianna Pregnancy Resource 
Center, which operates out of a mobile van and a 
building nestled next to the New Haven Hospital 
Saint Raphael Campus in New Haven’s Dwight 
neighborhood. Meanwhile, there’s only one 
licensed abortion clinic in New Haven. And it’s 
IOBMA’s neighbor.


**Title: Like Mother**
**Page number(s): 36**

“I knew in my heart that one day I would be doing 
this,” said Solsbery, with a gesture around the 
office. “Because I came from where they’re at.”

She’s talking about her clients—pregnant 
mothers seeking help in this den of religious and 
infant paraphernalia. But those clients are hard to 
find. I tried reaching out to IOBMA clients for this 
piece, but wasn’t able to talk to them—because of 
a discomfort with speaking publicly, because the 
office was empty, or because Solsbery wanted to 
protect their privacy, citing legal binding by the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA). (By definition, as a medically unli­
censed clinic, IOBMA is not bound by HIPAA).

In 2014, Solsbery founded IOBMA as a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit pregnancy resource center at 340 
Whitney Avenue. A Catholic, Solsbery was six­
teen when she had her first child and struggled to 
find resources to help her navigate single mother­
hood, which she said were less plentiful back then. 
Now, she’s a great-grandmother—and thanks 
God she had her child, because she had to have 
a hysterectomy at age twenty-one. “That’s why I 
always say people regret abortions, but they never 
regret a child,” she said.

Ivana Solsbery’s got blue-green eyes, long 
blond hair, and she’s light on her feet. She treads 
calmly, to the tune of utter cacophony—a medley 
of syncopated key jangling, colliding rosary beads, 
and a cell phone that rings every ninety or so sec­
onds. It’s usually spam, sometimes business. She 
puts up with the noise, maybe even likes it—in 
fact, she’s working on setting up two more phones 
in the center soon. 

It’s hard to imagine Solsbery doing her job in 
the quiet. That would mean staying still, or put­
ting down her things. Solsbery’s role at IOBMA 
is anything but a traditional, stationary desk 
job. Her other titles might be informal, but she 
simultaneously does the work of a recruiter, client 
counselor, fundraiser, volunteer coordinator, trea­
surer, and delivery service driver, among others. 
She’s on the go.

“We gotta keep it moving,” she said. “If they 
need something, whatever it may be, we do our 
whole power to get it done . . . We’ve never not 
gotten it done.” Solsbery told me she ends up 
doing a lot of the IOBMA work alone, but she often 
describes her work using the “we” pronoun, not an 
“I”. Perhaps she doesn’t give herself enough credit, 
or perhaps the “we” is more figurative. Still, she 
said she keeps some things separate from the “we.”

“I don’t push my religion on anybody,” she said. 
“All I’m here to do is to try to help.”

That’s Solsbery’s articulation of her mis­
sion. The IOBMA mission statement on its web­
site is more specific: As the Lord’s purveyor of 
hope and the Mother’s helpers, our mission is to love 
mothers and children, make them our friends for life,
and end abortion.

On the latter point of the IOBMA mission, 
Solsbery said, “We don’t refer for an abortion.” 
Still, she explained, “that doesn’t mean that we 
don’t talk about it, don’t discourage it or anything. 
That’s up to the individual. All we do is give the 
truth. They want it, they can come. If they don’t, 
that’s their choice also.”

But what are Solsbery’s personal beliefs 
about the truth? Here are her main points about 
abortion:

“I don’t know, that’s my opinion,” said Solsbery.

Solsbery has her beliefs. She said she’s 
upfront with clients that she’s Catholic, but that 
it’s “not an issue at all . . . because we’re just here 
to help and they know that.” Her beliefs about 
abortion don’t disrupt the IOBMA operation: “We 
set them down and show them their options,
from abortion to medical.” 
But Solsbery also explained that “it’s sad that 
our society . . . can’t see life within the woman, and 
it’s not her choice—I’m sorry, she has another 
individual in her now, the child’s in the world 
because she’s in the world.” 

Still, Solsbery said she has helped fund abor­
tion for at least one client in the past. But neither 
the center’s website nor the blue brochure distrib­
uted on the sidewalk advertise that IOBMA offers 
anything about abortion—information, funding, 
referrals, or otherwise. The services that the cen­
ter does advertise online include housing, emer­
gency food and transportation, financial and legal 
aid, pre-natal care, baby supplies, post-abortion 
programs and support, adoption information, and 
sexually transmitted disease education. Solsbery 
said she also helps pay utility bills and rent, as 
well as find babysitters and jobs for clients. Most 
of her clients are pregnant, she said, and the num­
ber she’s working with at a given moment can 
usually range from one to seven.

There’s another service, which makes up the 
second half of the mission statement of IOBMA. 
•	
“It’s like a cancer in our world that’s spreading everywhere.”
(The national rate of legal abortion has declined steadily since the eighties, 
according to the Guttmacher Institute, except for an eight percent increase
in 2020.)
“For me, rape is a very very evil act done to an individual, but abortion’s
evil also, so you’re going to hurt this person two times?”
(According to the American Psychological Association, being denied an abor­
tion has a greater impact on mental health than receiving a wanted abortion.)
“You have another separate human being inside you that doesn’t give you 
the right to kill it, it just doesn’t. I mean that’s more brutal than African 
Americans being enslaved to all of this Holocaust—this is more than any
war, more human beings.”
“There’s been a lot of women who have died from [abortion].”
(The mortality rate for legal abortion in the United States is 0.7 deaths per 
100,000 procedures. By contrast, the maternal mortality rate is 23.8 deaths
per 100,000 births, as of 2020, according to the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention. The maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women
is 55.3 per 100,000.)

From the iobma 
mission statement.


Solsbery said it comprises most of her work, and 
that it’s “what’s different between our center and 
a lot of them”:
Another part of our mission is to deliver our 
Lord’s message of life over abortion to the most needy 
and vulnerable communities. We do not wait for 
these women in need to come to us; we go to them. 
In Our Blessed Mother’s Arms actively reaches out

gram and takes God’s message of love and assistance
In practice, we go to them is pretty literal: 
Solsbery drives directly to the doorsteps of her 
clients in New Haven, Waterbury, Meriden, 
Hamden—“all over here.” While recruitment 
happens outside Planned Parenthood, Solsbery’s 
grassroots outreach happens from behind the wheel, 
with a trunk full of diapers, food, and other sup­
plies. The clients she hasn’t already met on the 
sidewalk by Planned Parenthood usually hear 
about IOBMA through the recommendation of 
past clients. They often call without coming in 
person to IOBMA. This way, she said, her clients 
don’t have to pay for bus tickets or gas. Most of 
her descriptions of trips to help clients involve 
delivery of basic provisions for infants.
“I’ve been out at 10 o’clock delivering for­
mula,” said Solsbery. “The baby had diarrhea and 
went through the diapers, I came and delivered
them to ‘em.”
Solsbery seems proud of her work with 
New Haven’s refugee and immigrant communi­
ties. She mentioned a couple from Afghanistan, 
another from Iraq. She spoke about a girl from 
China, pointing to a photo of a family in a din­
ing room on the wall of her office. “This little girl 
was almost aborted, but—and they’re very intel­
ligent people—they were scared,” she said. “In 
their country at that time they could only have 
one child.” (New Haven’s resettlement agency, 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services (IRIS), 
doesn’t send its clients to crisis pregnancy centers 
in New Haven, according to Nika Zarazvand, a 
Health Coordinator at IRIS. Solsbery said she 
mostly meets these clients on the sidewalk out­
side Planned Parenthood.)
Solsbery switched IOBMA’s label from a preg­
nancy resource center to a family center four 
years ago, and maintains that it’s still a 501(c)(3) 
nonprofit organization. The change was made to 
reflect the center’s expansion from strictly moth­
erhood-related services to food, housing, and 
beyond—as well as the aim of the organization to 
“unite families,” Solsbery said, and to “involve the 
whole family”with pregnancies.
“I’ve had dads cry on my shoulder because 
they didn’t want to have this abortion, but he had 
no choice in the matter,” Solsbery said. “He’s the 
father and our laws haven’t even caught up with 
that, and I feel so bad . . . He wants to do what’s 
right and he can’t.”
In veering away from the medical front of 
other crisis pregnancy centers, IOBMA perhaps 
becomes more appealing. Not only does it appear 
professionally homey, it promises a personal 
and long-term relationship with clients, with an
all-in-one owner-recruiter-counselor-financer 
point-person who guides patients by the hand, 
each step of the way. By contrast, Connecticut’s 
only state-level abortion fund, the Reproductive 
Equity Access Choice (REACH) Fund, provides a 
markedly impersonal service in order to protect 
patients’ privacy and decision-making processes. 
For Jessica Puk, Board President and Co-Founder 
of REACH, “it’s enough just knowing that we 
helped people get their healthcare.”
A long-haul, one-on-one, one-stop-shop—
IOBMA makes a bigger promise. And perhaps the 
biggest part of that promise: it’s free. Solsbery said 
she funds the many services of IOBMA through 
individual donations, and events like church 
drives, baby bottle drives, a biannual fundraiser 
by a young women’s group at Branford High 
School, and an oyster festival in Milford where 
she planned to sell some snow cones. “I’m always 
doing some kind of fundraiser,” she said.
She said she’s also constantly applying for 
and requesting grants from local ministries, such 
as the Archdiocese of Hartford, and wherever 
else she can find funding. IOBMA’s Form 990—its 
income tax form, obtained online—from 2014 
was the only publicly available record of IOBMA 
spending that I could find. It shows that the cen­
ter received just under $11,000 that year in “con­
tributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts,” 
which made up all its income. The largest listed 
expense was the “provision of diapers, lotion, for­
mula creams and necessities for mother & babies,” 
amounting to almost $2,300, followed by “cloth­
ing, bedding, high chairs, car seats for babies as 
needed,” at around $1,000, then “printing, publi­
cations, postage, and shipping” at $950, and “sup­
plemented food for families of clients as needed” 
at about $700. No rent is listed as an expense.
It’s about the family unit, not a medical prac­
tice; Solsbery claims clients’ decisions to seek 
abortions is respected and discussed, rather than 
totally rejected; it’s a local, home-grown organi­
zation funded by Solsbery pulling herself up by 
her bootstraps and finding funds in her com­
munity, not some direct overhead fund, and it 
doesn’t invoke the name recognition of a major 
crisis pregnancy center network like Birthright,

which has seven locations across Connecticut 
and at least hundreds nationally. In Our Blessed 
Mother’s Arms, maybe, isn’t like the typical crisis 
pregnancy center.
Or maybe it is. What’s atypical about IOBMA 
makes it somewhat standard: crisis pregnancy 
centers all around Connecticut and the coun­
try have their own individual identities, formed 
through variations in geography, resource offer­
ings, homeyness, professionalism, basis in faith, 
and commitment to long-term relationships with 
clients. Connecticut’s crisis pregnancy centers 
deploy via mobile van, juxtaposition with abortion 
clinics, and nestle in some of the state’s lowest-
income regions like Bridgeport, Waterbury, and 
Cheshire; they offer different combinations of 
pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, couples’ counsel­
ling, information about abortion and adoption, 
and parenting counselling, among other offerings. 
IOBMA has filed its tax returns under the family 
services category, not reproductive health care, 
but other crisis pregnancy centers in the state file 
under alternative categories too, like human ser­
vices, women’s services, religion, and maternal and 
prenatal health.
IOBMA’s also a former affiliate of Heartbeat 
International, one of the nation’s largest cri­
sis pregnancy networks, according to Solsbery 
and a certificate in her center that indicated the 
affiliation expired in 2016. Solsbery’s working 
to get funding for an ultrasound machine from 
the Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest 
Catholic fraternal service, whose global head­
quarters is located in New Haven. The organiza­
tion will hopefully match the funds she raises for 
the machine through their designated program 
for purchasing ultrasounds for crisis pregnancy 
centers. Solsbery saidshe hopes to find a doctor 
who will operate the machine.


**Title: 4. Like Yesterday**
**Page number(s): 39**

In Tiny You: A Western History of the Anti-Abortion 
Movement, Jennifer Holland—an author and 
University of Oklahoma professor of history 
specializing in abortion history—traces the early 
modern anti-abortion movement with a focus on 
the American West, where many of the country’s 
first crisis pregnancy centers sprang up in the six­
ties. It’s also where Solsbery—born in San Diego 
and later spending time in Colorado—said she 
spent her life before moving to New Haven at the 
turn of the century. 
Back then, according to Holland, most crisis 
pregnancy centers were led by either evangel­
ical Christians or Catholics—with evangelical 
Christians believing in proselytizing the immo­
rality of abortion to clients, and Catholics focus­
ing on prayer without preaching. And within 
these denominations, staff were historically 
mostly white women. Unlike men, women could 
uniquely convey “that it was their experience 
as women that led them to their anti-abortion 
stance, not partisan politics,” Holland writes. 
The position and status of white women gave 
them “the experiential authority to speak to other 
women and the moral authority to intervene in 
intimate familial issues.” Beyond professional­
ism and medical posture, many centers sough to 
create a “kitchen table feeling” while interact­
ing with clients to personalize the experience as
much as possible.
Solsbery carries on these founding traditions, 
including the old Catholic approach—recruiting 
with prayer because “that’s our way of helping,” 
but she doesn’t expect her clients to share her reli­
gious views.
IOBMA also contains many of the shifting 
strategies of crisis pregnancy centers—especially 
the focus on the fetus, a notorious and founda­
tional tenet of the modern anti-abortion move­
ment used to convey that fetuses constitute 
human life and that abortion is murder. In IOBMA, 
there’s fetal development chart lining the wall 
in her center’s bathroom, there’s a seven-minute 
video on DVD showing fetal development in the 
womb, and there are fetal dolls that she tucks into 
the palms of potential clients on the sidewalk 
(“for when we don’t have time” to explain, she 
said), and Solsbery herself resists language refer­
ring to the fetus.
“The child in the womb,” explained Solsbery, 
“is a child. It’s not a fetus. It’s not a baby.”
In the late seventies, according to Holland, 
people running crisis pregnancy centers realized 
that the kitchen table strategy was not enough 
because they were largely serving low-income 
women, young women, and women of color 
who faced practical challenges that moral guid­
ance couldn’t answer. They increasingly began 
offering family support services to supplement 
their messaging. Today, IOBMA, as a family

center, still embodies this emphasis on support, 
and its grassroots outreach program perhaps takes
it to new heights.
“White women activists asserted their moral 
authority by claiming to have special access to 
universal truths,” writes Holland. “And they tried 
to use that moral authority to transform the 
women of color, poor women, and young women 
who were the majority of the clients at [crisis 
pregnancy centers].” 

By the eighties, family support services 
weren’t producing the results crisis pregnancy 
center leaders desired for the amount of effort 
and resources they required. So they sought to 
focus on the client as well as the fetus. Abortion 
didn’t just hurt the fetus, it hurt the client, 
too. “Abortion-seeking women were no lon­
ger just victims of coercion or poverty,” writes 
Holland. “They were victims of abortion itself.” 

Anti-abortion activists began using the term 
“post-abortion syndrome,” which claims that abor­
tion causes post-traumatic-stress disorder-like ill­
ness. Diagnosis was loose, so almost anyone who 
had an abortion could be told they had a clinical 
condition attributable to the fact that they termi­
nated a pregnancy. The American Psychological 
Association (APA), the Journal of the American 
Medical Association, and similar organizations 
have never recognized the condition—meanwhile, 
the APA asserts that carrying an unwanted preg­
nancy to term increases risks for mental health 
and domestic abuse. But post-abortion syndrome 
still holds firm in all kinds of crisis pregnancy 
centers today. 

IOBMA is no exception: it offers “post-abor­
tion programs and support” on its website and, 
on at least one visit, there was a booklet on-site 
with guidance for “Identifying and Overcoming 
Post-Abortion Syndrome.” Solsbery even had 
a brochure for Rachel’s Vineyard, a weekend 
retreat program she said at least one of her cli­
ents has attended, with the slogan healing the pain 
of abortion—one weekend at a time. The program 
is offered at locations around the globe in both 
Catholic and non-denominational settings. The 
Connecticut outpost is in Farmington. 

Between kitchen table domestic quaintness, 
family values imbued through family services, 
and the creation of post-abortion syndrome, 
Holland writes that anti-abortionists “made the

supposedly intrinsic knowledge of fetal life cen­
tral to the female experience” in crisis pregnancy 
centers. Though it was founded in 2014, and is a 
long way from Solsbery’s home and those found­
ing crisis pregnancy centers on the west coast, 
there’s a time capsule of crisis pregnancy center 
tactics threading through IOBMA’s philosophy and 
practice. The history lives on.

And now, Solsbery said she is feeling hopeful 
about the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. 
Wade. “Look how many lives are going to be saved,” 
she said. “The schools are decreasing because of 
abortion.” In the first hand motion she’d made in 
an hour, she pressed her two hands down hard on 
top of each other on her desk. “This is facts.”

5. Full Circle
Up until November, the IOBMA recruitment for­
mula was a matter of summation. On an August 
12th visit, the props added up: six homemade dan­
gling rosaries, five pairs of sunglasses, two por­
table stools for those who don’t stand for long 
stretches, one plastic grocery bag filled with bro­
chures, seven lawn signs plugged into the grass. 
The result: one prayer circle straddling the side­
walk outside Planned Parenthood. It set the stage 
for a seemingly infinite recitation of the rosary.

Prayer kept to a schedule: 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 
p.m., Wednesdays and Fridays, each with a differ­
ent set of prayer regulars. Members of the Friday 
group said they are part of the same church—
Saint Mary’s Church in Clinton, Connecticut. 
On the Fridays I visited, the attendees dangling 
rosaries with Solsbery weren’t official volunteers 
or employees of the clinic—they just prayed, and 
maybe distributed some literature. The other 
helpers were the lawn signs: LIFE styled in 
the Game of Life font, ABORTION STOPS A 
BEATING HEART, PRAY TO END ABORTION, 
64,000 US LIVES LOST (except the 4 is a 3 that’s 
been x-ed out by hand with marker), a painting of 
the Virgin Mary.

But the real key to the equation, it seemed, 
happened when the circle broke. That sweaty 
day in August, one attendee, visibly the youngest, 
spearheaded the interruption. 

At first, she just seemed distracted. In between 
utterances of Hail Mary and pray for us sinners now, 
her eyes lifted from the scripture, past the vortex of 
the circle. Something caught her attention—then, 
more darting glances, a nudging of her neighbor. 
A mumble was exchanged, a decision was made. 
Someone shoved a pamphlet into her hands, and 
she started walking towards a young woman at 
the stoplight at Whitney and Edwards Street, 
headed away from Planned Parenthood. En route, 
her walk broke into a jog. Solsbery tagged behind, 
with even more urgency and more pamphlets. 
Later, Solsbery told me that the woman they 


**Page number(s): 42**

stopped was pregnant, that she seemed interested 
in IOBMA, and that she said she’d stop by. Back
on the sidewalk, prayer resumed. 

When first looking for Solsbery’s prayer circle 
in August, I accidentally approached a different 
group stationed at the Planned Parenthood side­
walk, on the other side of the parking lot. There, 
a woman handed me a brochure with more bla­
tant messaging than the one Solsbery distributed. 
Where Solsbery’s asked Pregnant? Worried?, this 
one straightforwardly implored PLEASE HAVE 
YOUR BABY. Where Solsbery’s included a draw­
ing of a fetus, this one was more photographic, 
with an insert displaying HUMAN GARBAGE—
fetus corpses in a trash can. Where IOBMA 
offered alternatives to abortion, this one pleaded 
To save the life of your BABY the LAMINARIA
(seaweed sticks) can STILL BE REMOVED.

But both brochures featured the same list of 
six crisis pregnancy centers in the Greater New 
Haven area and an abortion pill reversal hotline. 
IOBMA is the first on that list.

“They’re more vocal,” said Solsbery, referring 
to the other group. “We do the quiet approach.”

IOBMA’s sidewalk recruitment is getting qui­
eter, and getting centralized. Solsbery recently 
applied to and began a partnership with Sidewalk 
Advocates for Life—an organization with the 
mission statement to train, equip, and support com­
munities across the United States and the world in 
sidewalk advocacy: to be the hands and feet of Christ, 
offering loving, life-affirming alternatives to all pres­
ent at abortion facilities, thereby eliminating demand 
and ending abortion. The organization currently 
operates 239 sites nationwide, and is helping train 
new volunteers to revamp the IOBMA prayer ses­
sions outside Planned Parenthood. Solsbery said 
she realized that the old method was “intrusive,” 
and she wanted to make her sidewalk presence 
more approachable.

When I visited in November, Solsbery had 
already gained a new uniform and a goodie bag: 
a Sidewalk Advocates-branded blue traffic vest, 
and a pink-clothed sack containing Bath & Body 
Works lotion alongside some brochures. A few 
hundred feet away, in the middle of the parking 
lot, Planned Parenthood’s escorts stood emp­
ty-handed in neon pink traffic vests. 

Going forward, prayer will be moved fur­
ther away, to the other side of Edwards Street, 
while Solsbery will recruit alongside Sidewalk 
Advocates-trained volunteers where prayer hap­
pened. Solsbery said she’ll be distributing some 
additional literature: business cards for hotlines—
Love Line and Option Line—that connect call­
ers to local crisis pregnancy centers. The signs are 
coming down, too, and being replaced by a sin­
gle sign advertising the link and hotline of the 
Abortion Pill Rescue Network. Abortion rever­
sal—advertised as a counteracting treatment to 
medication abortion—is based on “unproven and 
unethical research,” according to the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,

the nation’s leading organization of reproduc­
tive health clinicians. The Abortion Pill Rescue 
Network and Option Line are both programs of 
Heartbeat International, one of the largest crisis 
pregnancy center networks in the country.

The new recruitment strategy is show­
ing results already. She’s barely tried out the 
new methodology, but more people, she said, 
are stopping on the sidewalk than she’s seen
in a long time.


6. No Harm, No Foul
Crisis pregnancy centers have strong free speech 
protections. Laura Portuondo—a Fellow with 
the Program for the Study of Reproductive 
Justice at Yale Law School and an advisor for the 
Law School’s Reproductive Rights and Justice 
Project—explains it this way: the Supreme 
Court has “essentially tied itself into knots” to 
protect crisis pregnancy free speech. These pro­
tections were bolstered back in 2018, when the 
Court heard National Institute of Family and Life 
Advocates (nifla) v. Becerra—a lawsuit filed by 
one of the nation’s largest crisis pregnancy cen­
ter networks—in response to a law passed in 
California requiring crisis pregnancy centers to 
post information about state-offered abortion 
and contraception services, along with a notice 
that they are medically unlicensed. NIFLA argued 
that the government violated their right to free 
speech. The Supreme Court agreed, striking 
down the law in a 5–4 decision. Before the time 
of nifla v. Becerra, crisis pregnancy center speech 
was more so regarded by the Court as the com­
mercial speech of an operational business. Now,

the Court regards it as “traditional speech, like 
you or me,” said Portuondo. And this speech is
much harder to regulate.

Still, Connecticut has attempted to regulate 
it, following in California’s footsteps. In 2021, 
Connecticut passed a bill targeting deceptive 
advertising and created an avenue for reporting 
it through the Attorney General, who can then 
determine if it’s deceptive and open a court order 
to have it taken down. Deceptive advertising, as 
the bill puts it, constitutes “any statement con­
cerning any pregnancy-related service or the 
provision of any pregnancy-related service that is 
deceptive, whether by statement or omission, and 
that a limited services pregnancy center knows or 
reasonably should know to be deceptive.” The bill 
has limited some online advertising, according to 
State Representative Jillian Gilchrest (D-West 
Hartford), a co-sponsor of the bill, and other­
wise cracking down has been a game of “cat and 
mouse.” And there’s still the caveat that “there 
can be crisis pregnancy centers who might be 
misinforming individuals who actually enter their 
physical space or who have misinformation in the 
physical space.” 

Connecticut’s advertising bill is being chal­
lenged by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), 
the same organization that defended NIFLA in 
the California case, and that helped draft and 
defend the Mississippi legislation that led to 
the toppling of Roe v. Wade. ADF filed a federal 
lawsuit against Attorney General William Tong, 
on behalf of the Care Net Pregnancy Resource 
Center of Southeastern Connecticut using a 
similar interpretation of the First Amendment
to the California case.

Liz Gustafson is the State Director of Pro-
Choice Connecticut, a non-profit that works 
to protect and expand reproductive freedom in 
Connecticut, and that collaborates with simi­
lar organizations across the country to engage 
nationally with its mission. She’s also a former 
escort for Hartford GYN, an abortion clinic that 
used to share a parking lot with a crisis pregnancy 
center. Liz Gustafson said that the legal backing 
of crisis pregnancy centers crystallizes their criti­
cal role in the anti-abortion movement.

“[Crisis pregnancy centers] fundamentally 
operate as the frontline for the anti-abortion 
movement, so while they may be operating in 
some kind of different way, all of them move right 
into the same courtyard,” said Gustafson. And if 
crisis pregnancy centers weren’t the frontline, she 
asked, “then why is the legal arm of the anti-abor­
tion 
movement 
challenging 
our 
Attorney
General legally?”

Crisis pregnancy centers seem to exist at a 
remove from legal and political realms of the 
anti-abortion movement, despite serving it, in 
part because they have largely been unbounded 
by legal responsibility for communicating accu­
rately to clients, in part because appearing non­
partisan helps them recruit clients. These factors 
combined have helped crisis pregnancy centers 
work to change minds and hearts about abortion 
in as personal a means as possible. 

For Dina Montemarano—who studies dis­
information in the anti-abortion movement as 
the Research Director for NARAL Pro-Choice 
America, a large nonprofit national organization 
that leads lobbying, political action, and advo­
cacy efforts to protect reproductive freedom—of 
all the ways that the anti-abortion movement 
spreads disinformation, crisis pregnancy centers 
might be the most severe: “meeting people face to 
face at a time when they desperately need some­
one who they can trust, who can give them cor­
rect information—in some way that’s the cruelest 
way that [the anti-abortion movement] is spread­
ing that disinformation,” she said.

Crisis pregnancy centers have honed and 
shifted tactics over time to persuade preg­
nant women to carry their pregnancies to term. 
Meanwhile, legal challenges to abortion have 
shifted strategy in the context of what can be 
argued as constitutional. IOBMA has narrowed in 
on family services that address real, important 
needs of families—but that is an approach cri­
sis pregnancy centers have used for decades to 
target low-income women and women of color. 
IOBMA’s family focus, and its lack of abortion ser­
vice advertising, make it seem relatively mild in 
a sea of crisis pregnancy centers that present as 
Planned Parenthood-like medical clinics. In the 
eyes of the law, it’s pretty clean. But that doesn’t 
change that, while its operation provides real and 
necessary services in the process of delivering our 
Lord’s message of life over abortion to the most needy 
and vulnerable communities, it’s part of the center’s 
particular mechanism of a broad mission to end 
abortion. This means that IOBMA might be quite 
helpful for pregnant clients who know they’d 
like to carry their pregnancies to term, especially 
because IOBMA’s services are free. But for clients 
who might otherwise have decided to have an 
abortion, IOBMA could be dissuasive. And now, 
by recently gaining an ultrasound machine and 
deprioritizing prayer on the sidewalk, IOBMA is 
partially sacrificing its non-medical appearance in 
favor of approachability, potentially to the effect 
of dissuading those clients who might have other­
wise sought out medical expertise and an abortion.

Liz Gustafson recognizes the value of the 
services of crisis pregnancy centers in spite of 
their stances on abortion. “The provision of free 
resources is important, right? Because obviously 
there is a gap in terms of people being able to 
acquire the resources that they need, like free 
diapers,” said Gustafson. “That doesn’t negate 
the fact that they are still a component of the 
anti-abortion movement. I think, if anything, 
that should be an opportunity for our local and 
state government to fill in that gap. Of course, 
we don’t want these organizations who are 
perpetuating dangerous misinformation and 
also just stigma and shame and just terrible, 

“meeting people
face to face at a time 
when they desperately 
need someone who 
they can trust, who 
can give them correct 
information—in some
way that’s the cruelest
way that [the anti-
abortion movement] 
is spreading that dis-
information,” she said.


45
inaccurate information, but also we need to make 
sure that people who need free resources are able
to get those resources.”

Solsbery works hard to fund, deliver, organize, 
and execute her services. At Thanksgiving, she 
drove approximately forty turkey dinners to fami­
lies in and around New Haven. “They were people 
in need,” she said. “And that’s what I’d hope that 
Planned Parenthood would realize someday: that 
if they’re for choice and the woman that chooses 
life, how come they don’t help her?”

New Haven’s Planned Parenthood doesn’t 
deliver turkey dinners, but, in addition to offering 
abortion and abortion referrals, it offers adoption 
services, adoption referrals, fertility awareness 
education, pregnancy options education, preg­
nancy planning services, birth control, emergency 
contraception, pregnancy testing, and trained 
staff to talk with patients who’ve experienced 
early pregnancy loss, or miscarriages. 

These cost of these services is low, if not free, 
through Medicaid, and other health insurance 
programs, and Planned Parenthood’s subsidiza­
tion programs. Connecticut also offers, as a part of 
its Medicaid public health coverage, Health Care 
for Uninsured Kids and Youth (HUSKY) Health. 
The program subsidizes health services either at 
low cost or for free—depending on income—for 
children, parents, relative caregivers, and pregnant 
people, among others. Undocumented immi­
grants are eligible for HUSKY coverage for prenatal 
care; children up to age nineteen qualify regard­
less of family income. There’s also the REACH 
Fund, Connecticut’s first state-level abortion fund, 
which started partially funding abortions this 
fall using a $50,000-and-growing fund. There’s 
other nonprofits that help with basic childrearing 
necessities, too—like Connecticut Diaper Bank, 
which delivers 300,000 diapers to 6,400 families 
in the state each month.

IOBMA is far from the only alternative to get­
ting an abortion at Planned Parenthood. While 
IOBMA has the guarantee of free services, it’s up 
against some robust competition and affordable 
avenues to obtain them—many of which are 
bound by privacy laws and rigorous standards of 
professional qualifications. 

Despite Connecticut’s resources, however, 
US Census Bureau Data consistently shows 
that Connecticut is a state with extreme wealth 
disparity. And there will always be those who 
don’t have insurance, or who don’t know all the 
options available, or times when government 
support isn’t enough. And perhaps IOBMA will be
there for them.

Solsbery’s concerned with the truth, and 
the women she says are being deprived of it. “It 
should just be about being truthful with each 
individual,” she said. “They have the choice in the 
end—not me, not you. Whoever’s in this situa­
tion, they have the choice in the end, but if they 
know all of their choices—there’s many out there, 
really—then that still becomes free will. God 
gives us free will, so that becomes that person’s 
free will. But if they’re not told the whole truth, no,
that’s not right.” 

The anti-abortion movement has evolved into 
an amalgamated giant over the last fifty years, and 
through it truth has remained a moral fact bol­
stered by false information. Reflecting this cen­
tral truth of the anti-abortion movement—that 
abortion is wrong—through the prismatic lens of 
In Our Blessed Mother’s Arms’ many helpful ser­
vices, that helpfulness seems more sinister. 

IOBMA comprises one woman working with 
one pregnant client at a time, in a state with some 
of the strongest guarantees of abortion rights, in a 
city with services supporting access to reproduc­
tive care. Solsbery has helped at least one client 
fund an abortion, and she’s not interested in pros­
elytizing. It seems harmless. But IOBMA doesn’t 
exist in a solitary vacuum: it builds on the wis­
dom and resources of generations of crisis preg­
nancy centers created to persuade clients to carry 
pregnancies to term. The delicate, hodgepodge, 
homemade quality of IOBMA reflects a power­
ful lifeblood of the anti-abortion movement: 
white women with a cause and the maternal 
approachability to persuade. The mission, after all,
is to end abortion.


7. For the Road
Back at Planned Parenthood, Ivana Solsbery is 
doing her sidewalk circle duties. It’s September, 
and the wind’s got a bite. There’s talks in the 
group of getting an abortion pill reversal sign 
soon, but for now recruitment is still happen­
ing the old way—the spotlight’s on prayer, signs,
and the rosary.

Mid-prayer, the wind knocks over a sign. A 
few minutes later, someone riding a bike knocks 
over another, mumbling something. Both times, 
the signs are immediately put back, with a similar 
urgency to the literature distribution jogging.

“There you go. That’s the other side,” said 
Solsbery, with a sigh, to no one in particular.

 Election season’s on the horizon, too, and 
one of the prayer attendees is wearing a Leora 
Levy cap. On the car next to her, there’s a Leora 
Levy sticker. In the trunk, there’s a Leora Levy 
lawn sign. In November, Leora Levy—the Con­
necticut Republican Senate candidate endorsed 
by Trump—lost the Senate race. 

At one point, Solsbery’s attention turns to the 
Planned Parenthood escorts in pink traffic vests 
in the middle of the parking lot. She’s flabber­
gasted. “Why would anyone volunteer to do that?” 
she asked. ∎

of the most exclusionary shorelines in 
the country.
24 of Connecticut’s 169 cities and 
towns border the Long Island Sound. 
Over half of Connecticut’s population 
lives in coastal zones defined by these cit­
ies’ borders. Across the state, municipal 
beaches have curbed non-resident access 
to their shores by charging skyrocket­
ing rates for seasonal passes. Westport, 
for example, charges out-of-towners 
over fifteen times more for beach park­
ing than its residents—$50 a season for 
residents and $775 for everyone else. In 
Stamford, residents pay a flat rate of $26 
a season while non-residents pay the 
town $292. New Haven’s beaches hold 
some of the state’s least financial restric­
tions—with the famed Lighthouse Point 
Park charging non-residents $25 per day 
or $100 for the summer season. But just 
a few miles away, West Haven keeps the 
bar to entry high, requiring non-res­
idents to pay more than double New 
Haven’s ask, at $250 for the season. 
“Connecticut beaches are gated in 
ways that should be offensive to every

“IN ESSENCE,
TOO MANY
PUBLIC BEACHES 
IN CONNECTICUT 
HAVE BECOME 
COUNTRY CLUBS.”


the towns’ wealthy and predominantly 
white residents. These fines are more 
than a summertime inconvenience: they 
perpetuate a persisting legacy of racial 
and economic exclusion in New England. 
They are emblematic of national man­
ifestations of rampant injustice which 
certainly do not begin or end at the coast.


The emergence of private beaches in 
Connecticut can be traced back to the 
1880s, when the state legislature granted 
a charter allotting self-government to 
affluent families who had converted 
Old Saybrook into their new vacation 
haven. Early twentieth century com­
mercial developers then bought up the 
state coastline, converting farm and for­
est lands into vacation homes packaged 
for middle-class whites. Charters barred 
non-residents from operating parks, 
beaches, and streets, and they explicitly 
enacted racially restrictive housing cov­
enants preventing Black and Jewish buy­
ers from becoming coastal homeowners.


Even after the Fair Housing Act was 
passed in 1968—which prohibited hous­
ing discrimination by landlords, munic­
ipalities and other housing providers on 
the basis of race, sex, religion, national 
origin, familial status and disability—
these racially discriminatory real estate 
practices persisted. Local policymakers 
made the switch to using language that 
centers one’s residential status to perpet­
uate these segregating measures. Today, 
thinly veiled, racially coded language 
bars “non-residents” from beachside 
parking or weekend beach access in 
beach towns like Westport. And, in 
many locales, these restrictions are also 
reflected in the accessibility of housing 
and renting. Combined, they make the 
possibility of a beach weekend in some 
regions in Connecticut unfeasible.”


“The towns that are most egregious 
in establishing these differential rates for 
parking are the towns that have made it 
almost impossible for folks to move into 
those communities,” Lemar reflects. He 
speaks with equal parts history teacher 
authority and soccer dad optimism. “The 
Greenwiches, 
the 
Fairfields . . . [these 
towns] have very restrictive zoning laws 
that don’t allow for multi-family homes 
or for new home construction. They 
essentially close off their borders pur­
posefully to new occupants. And then 
they say ‘our beaches are only for people 
who live here.’ ”


Today, Greenwich bans multi-fam­
ily housing on over 95 percent of its land, 
despite the fact that multi-family homes 
once drove the town’s suburban growth. 
This push to build a community made 
almost entirely of single-family homes, 
and therefore push out lower-class and 
often non-white residents, was bol­
stered by a 2017 Planning and Zoning 
Commission measure to formally ban 
multi-family developments in the neigh­
borhood. Fairfield has followed suit, as 
exhibited by some Fairfield homeowners’ 
active resistance to state-mandated 
affordable housing developments within 
their town in the interest of protecting 
their uniform wealth and whiteness.


Effectively denying out-of-towners 
and the non-wealthy access to the beach 
is part of a legacy of broader policy pat­
terns like restrictive zoning that continue 
to engender segregation in Connecticut 
neighborhoods. Andrew Kahrl, professor 
of history and African American stud­
ies at the University of Virginia, studies 
the environmental history of land use 
and segregation in the twentieth cen­
tury, particularly in Connecticut and 
the American South. An even-tem­
pered academic, he talked through the 
phone with a punchy, resolute tone. He 
unflinchingly classified Connecticut as 
a state whose restrictive beach practices 
had a clear racial effect, “even if they dis­
claimed racial intent.” He stressed that 
the creation of resident-only, private 
beaches in the Northeast served as an 
example of local government-sanctioned 
practices of blatant segregation.


“In practice, Connecticut is a pro­
foundly segregated state around racial 
and class lines,” Kahrl told me. “[White 
and wealthy] communities fight like hell 
to prevent affordable housing, equita­
ble public schools, and shared public 
resources.”

declarations such as The beach has reached 
capacity, or Non-residents have to pay their 
fair share. These signs and fees serve as 
tangible manifestations of the beach 
town belief that its residents have an 
unquestionable right to their adjacent 
coastlines, while non-residents do not.


Others point to the financial inequity 
that they believe would follow from 
expanded Connecticut public beach 
access. As reported by the Greenwich 
Free Press, Brian Farnen, formerly a 
Connecticut State Representative in 
Fairfield (D-132), insisted on looking at 
the question of beach access from “an 
equity perspective”—that is, financial 
equity. As a reason for limiting beach 
access, he cited a perceived imbalance in 
tax dollars: Fairfield residents sent too 
much to the state capital, he wrote, when 
considering the funds that they received 
back to invest in their local community 
“Our typical resident . . . is paying so 
much money in property taxes to upkeep 
these beaches, [and] yes they should get 
that benefit,” Farnen noted.


State representatives like Lemar 
were quick to remind me that the idea 
that these wealthy coastal communi­
ties were primarily responsible for their 
beach’s upkeep is a fallacy. In reality, the 
Long Island Sound and its beaches are 
kept clean by state and federal govern­
ments. They invest hundreds of millions 
of dollars annually in sewage treatment 
and other wastewater management—
dollars which, ultimately, come from 
Connecticut residents, many of whom 
will be excluded from the beaches they 
help pay for.


“They’re 
not 
charging 
differen­
tial rates because they need help 
upkeeping their beaches,” Rep. Lemar 
insists. “That’s a bold-faced lie. They’re 
charging differential rates to keep
people out.”


New Haven beaches rank low in 
terms of restrictive access to the coast 
along the Long Island Sound. But the 
pandemic, Lemar told me, offered pub­
lic health restriction justification to limit 
beach access, even in previously accessi­
ble locations. This shift spurred Lemar 
to look at beaches through an equity 
lens—and in turn made his concern for 
the future of Connecticut beach accessi­
bility heighten.


“[I soon saw] that what started off as 
capping off beaches from a health and 
safety justification quickly shifted to lin­
gering resident-only regulations,” Lemar 
recalled, thinking back on summers in 
the state once COVID-19 cases had begun 
to decline. “I saw this right here in East 
Haven, which shut down access to the 
beach and went out of their way to ticket 
and tow non-locals, like my constituents 
in New Haven. The refusal to relax those 
rules after public guidance had relaxed,

these differential rate structures, points

to an underlying racial prejudice in the 
state and a [hoarding] of the very things 
all those in Connecticut should have the 
right to access.”


The myth of local beach upkeep 
functions in the interest of municipalities, 
who then monopolize these shorelines at 
the cost of widespread public access. 
“But all waters run to Long Island 
Sound: whether they like it or not, the 
whole state is involved,” Connecticut 
State Representative Michael Winkler 
of Vernon, Connecticut (D-56) echoed.


My mother grew up a block away from 
the infamously-bustling and border­
line-mythical Venice Beach boardwalk: 
an ecosystem defined by screenwriters 
with a dream, skaters with a cause, and 
NIMBY-homeowners with a fight to pick. 
My grandparents still live in a centu­
ry-old Californian apartment building 
in sight of the water. It’s the beachside 
heartbeat of our family.


About twenty miles west of the Rose 
Avenue Beach Tower in Venice stretches 
the long-fraught Malibu coastline, in 
which public access to the beach has 
come at an unearthly price. With the 
city’s founding came the violent des­
ecration of sacred Chumash land, as 
present-day Malibu stood as the south­
ern capital of the 200-mile spanning 
Chumash territory. Since its unlikely 
inception as the “Malibu Movie Colony” 
by the railroad-rich Rindge couple in

the 1930s, Malibu persists as the post­
er-child for private property and public 
trust disputes in the state. Just as Rhoda 
May Knight Rindge—the “Queen of 
Malibu”—once unsuccessfully attempted 
to block the construction of the Pacific 
Coast Highway through the Malibu Pier 
in order to tuck Malibu away from wide­
spread public access, Malibu’s billionaire 
elite have been closing off their beach 
fronts for decades. They’ve used pub­
lic intimidation tactics to scare off visi­
tors, along with clout and capital to try
to justify their exclusive right to the sea.


“There’s a sense in L.A. that if you’re 
rich you have earned the right to be 
insulated, to not have to live next to 
public lands,” formerly L.A.-based envi­
ronmental organizer and public artist 
Jenny Price GRD ’98 said to me. “What 
that means is that many people can’t get 
to the beach that they can see out their 
window.”


I wanted to better understand how 
the idea of access and upkeep are at play 
by the Pacific, so I spoke via Whatsapp 
with 
environmental 
historian 
and 
Southern Californian beach scholar Elsa 
Devienne. A Parisian native who for a 
decade has dedicated her research to the 
study of Southern Californian beach cul­
ture and climate, she called me while on 
holiday back home in the French coun­
tryside. She managed to both poke fun at 
our spotty telephone signal and solemnly 
discuss climate scientists’ predictions 
that sea level rise in the West Coast will 
reach 8 inches by 2050, leaving all but 
the largest Malibu beaches, like Zuma, 
swept below flood levels. 


“Beaches are what climate engineers 
call ‘rivers of sand,’” Devienne noted. 
“L.A. beaches were artificially enlarged in 
the seventies with generated sediment in 
order to meet rising demands to create 
modern beaches for a modern city. And 
due to a combination of both climate 
change and standard beach deterioration, 
they’re rapidly eroding.”


It’s a stunning and disconcertingly 
equalizing omen: even these coveted, 
star-studded beaches are not built to 
last. And still, fights for equitable pub­
lic beach access along Broad Beach and 
other famed Malibu beach fronts persist 
along this degenerating coastline. 
Malibu 
property 
owners 
have 
pushed back against expanding pub­
lic beach access since the beachtown’s 
unlikely inception in the early twenti­
eth century. Notably, American billion­
aire and entertainment industry mogul 
David Geffen made headlines in 1983 
when purchasing his beach mansion, 
which conjoined two existing prop­
erties and blocked a state-mandated 
sidewalk-to-shore public pathway. He 
made the news again in 2002 after refus­
ing to make public easements or beach 
access points on his Carbon “Billionaire’s” 
Beach Malibu home. Yet, in 2007, after 
substantial pushback, he agreed to open 
Sunrise at Malibu Lagoon, 2020.

up a 42-foot stretch of the prized Carbon 
Beach to the public in exchange for a 
10-foot privacy go-between. Despite this 
seemingly small-scale victory, Geffen’s 
concession marked a historic and prece­
dent-setting win for the state.


“The best way to make a beach pub­
lic is to get the public onto it,” Price said. 
“You have to learn which signs you can 
smile at and which you can ignore.” 


California is the only state to enforce 
public beach access thanks to the regu­
latory powers of the California Coastal 
Commission, an organization created by 
the state’s voters in 1972 amidst a rise of 
coastal and environmental activism in 
the 1960s and 1970s.


In early August, Linda Locklin 
called me from her turquoise blue, 
knick-knack filled office space in Santa 
Cruz, California. She speaks with a 
warm, instinctive grin. Locklin lets me 
know that she’s been the Coastal Access 
Program Manager for the commission 
for over three decades. She dreamed of 
marrying her interests in environmen­
tal planning and fieldwork with public 
benefit, and she feels she has achieved 
just that. She fearlessly loves this agency, 
what it stands for and what it defends.


Locklin speaks proudly of the criti­
cal victories the commission has secured. 
Through their issuing of permits for 
development across 1.5 million acres of 
state coastal lands, over the last thirty 
to forty years, the California Coastal 
Commission has been able to successfully 
obtain public walkways between houses 
on private property and public lands, 
despite private homeowners’ perpetual 
resistance to state regulations. She notes 
that widespread present-day access to 
Malibu beach fronts stands as an exam­
ple of how the public right to beach space
can win out against the muscle of capital.


“People have always known they’re 
welcome in vast public beaches like 
Zuma or Surfrider, but it takes gump­
tion to walk down recently-opened pub­
lic pathways to smaller beach fronts . . .” 
Locklin reflects. “They make you feel like 
you’re not wanted even though you have 
every legal right to be there.”


Now the Coastal Commission has 
the power to levy fines against public 
access violators, such as resistant coastal 
homeowners. They often go to court and, 
Locklin boasts, they have yet to lose.


In notes directed at the Connecticut 
state legislature opposing Rep. Lemar’s 
coastal equity bill, state residents from 
historically restrictive coastal suburbs 
like Fairfield and Greenwich said things 
ranging from:
 “As municipalities have seen over 
the years, Hartford creates an issue where 
there is not one and then passes the 
buck” to “I hope that you will reconsider,
otherwise you will be ruining our town!”


Other opponents believe beaches are 
a scarce resource that must be limited in 
order to avoid overwhelming capacity 
numbers.


Connecticut 
State 
Rep. 
Steve 
Meskers (D-150) of Greenwich explained 
that the popular beach destination, 
Greenwich Point, contained 1,100 park­
ing spaces, while the town consists of 
60,000 residents. He voiced that capac­
ity was nearly oversaturated as is, par­
ticularly on summer holiday, and there 
was no obvious area for additional beach 
parking or practical train transit.


“I’m not sure how I grant more 
incremental access,” Meskers told the 
Greenwich Free Press.


He further outlined that no state 
bills considered the over-extension of 
public access to non-state residents; 
shorelines like Greenwich touch the 
New York border, and are a common 
destination for residents of both states.


“I’m concerned I’m being asked for 
reciprocity to residents of another state,” 
Meskers suggested.


At the beginning of the century, 
many state beach activists hoped the 
issue of undue beach restrictions had 
been settled. Although the Connecticut 
Supreme Court ruling in Leydon 
v. Greenwich in 2001 affirmed the 
right of non-residents’ use of munici­
pal beaches, beach restrictions still run 
rampant. As a result of the Leydon 
ruling, non-residents are now legally 
allowed onto municipal beaches, but 
due to an onslaught of town-ordered

financial penalties, the act of doing so 
continues to be feasibly impractical. In 
response, in July of 2021, the American 
Civil Liberties Union named financially 
restrictive beach policies in counties like 
Greenwich and Westport as present day 
examples of de facto segregation. They 
also accused these measures of violat­
ing the Public Trust Doctrine, which 
ensures the public’s right to land above 
the mean high water line in coastal states 
like Connecticut. 

For the last two years, and most 
recently this past spring, Rep. Lemar 
has led the charge alongside other state 
government officials to push for reform 
through the enactment of HB 5361, an 
unpassed bill which aims to imple­
ment financial penalties to counties 
who do not abide by beach equity stan­
dards. After years of refraining from 
commenting on the subject, this spring, 
Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont—a 
Greenwich native—agreed there should 
be studies on the matter of beach access, 
withholding any definitive stance on the 
topic beyond supporting the “bipartisan 
effort to take a closer look at this import­
ant issue.” Lamont and other suburban 
shoreline candidates have sidelined this 
issue, likely due to an unwillingness to 
rock the political boat from the interests 
of politically influential suburbanites. 

“Voters don’t want studies, voters 
want solutions,” Rep. Winkler retorted 
on a call with me in July, urging the 
governor to both acknowledge and take 
a stand against systemic class and racial 
disparities by the coast. But months later, 
in November, Ned Lamont would go on 
to win re-election for governor.


Beach 
climate 
scholar 
Devienne 
acknowledges that coastal access 
is embedded in Californians’ sense 
of what is right and what is their right. 
Emboldened by the protections offered 
by the Coastal Commission and prec­
edent-setting efforts to fight for public 
space, they seem to possess an inherent 
belief that the every-day non-billion­
aire is entitled to coastal leisure, that 
one cannot simply weaponize their 
whiteness and wealth to warrant an 
unjustifiable claim over nature. Despite 
a deep-rooted history of exclusivity, 
evident in Connecticut’s implicit and 
explicit removal of Black and Brown 
beachgoers and beach town residents, a 
determined contingent of present-day 
Connecticut residenc seem to echo 
these sentiments for protected public
beach access.


Still, the environmental and social 
history of contested state and public 
land is irrefutably tied to the history of 
Indigenous removal, Black exclusion, 
and the preservation of whiteness in the 
outdoors, measures of erasure most often 
achieved through state violence. It may 
seem dangerous and illogical, therefore, 
to encourage state regulation as a means 
of pacifying the interests of local govern­
ments and rich landowners, and in turn 
addressing their particular wrongdoings, 
let alone in re-introducing a collective 
protection of leisure and the outdoors. 

While these reforms might successfully 
ensure the public right to access the out­
doors in legal terms, how these protec­
tions will manifest in government action, 
particularly as coastal lands become 
more and more of a scarce resource as the
climate crisis progresses, is yet to be seen.


What is certain is that exclusive 
beach access and its restrictive practices 
are extensions of long-ingrained systems 
of racial exclusion. And the protection 
of wealth and cementing of privilege 
come at a steep price: the perpetuation 
of a generations-spanning landmine of 
exclusion. All of this tug-of-war comes 
as climate-caused coastal flooding prom­
ises to wreak havoc on anybody unlucky 
enough to stand in its way, neither dis­
criminating by race nor class. It may be 
that the coastal beach-house billionaires 
are less territorial of their beachfront in 
the coming decades. It may be that as 
these beaches erode, so might the issue 
of beach access. Rest assured, however, 
that from coast to coast, there will con­
tinue to be calls to free whatever beach 
that remains. ∎

**Hotel Dreaming**
**Author: Kylie Volavongsa**

T
he studios are easy to miss. 
To find the one in New Haven, 
you have to go to the Graduate 
Hotel on Chapel Street, right across 
from the Yale School of Art. Walk 
through the doors, up a small flight of 
stairs and emerge into the lobby. Go 
past the mismatched sofas and armchairs, 
tacky wallpaper, and framed Yale para­
phernalia. Ignore the coffee counter—
even if that sharp whiff of freshly pulled 
espresso starts to draw you in. Go further, 
into the back room. Then the very back 
of the back room. 

If you see the small gold plaque by 
the wooden double doors, then you’ve 
found it. Graduate Dreams Society, it’ll say. 
That’s it.


I only found it because I was kind 
of forced to. There was a New Journal 
meeting in the back of the Graduate’s 
lobby for the design of the previous 
issue, and as a God-fearing Associate 
Editor of this magazine, I attended. But 
I didn’t know a thing about design, so 
my eyes wandered. I looked at lamps, 
then students staring at their laptops, 
then the big double doors. Then the 
shiny gold plaque right next to them.


I almost thought it was one of Yale’s 
secret societies.


A visit to the Sweet Dreams 
Society’s website is just about as vague as 
the plaque. The first thing to load on the 
screen is the all-seeing eye at the cen­
ter, just above the words “Dulce Fomnii,” 
which could mean “sweet dreams” in 
Latin if “Fomnii” wasn’t one letter 
away from “somnii,” the actual word for 
“dream”. This could’ve been a mistake in 
transcription—a version of the letter ‘s’ 
in Old English and Roman cursive can 
easily be confused for a lowercase ‘f.’ But 
to really learn about the Sweet Dreams 
Society, you have to move your cursor 
until the link to the About page presents 
itself in the top left corner of the screen. 
Turns out, my guess about the Society 
was close. Those big double doors are 
the entrance to an art studio, one of 
ten tucked away in select Graduate
Hotels across the country.


The Graduate Sweet Dreams Society is 
an immersive artist-in-residence program 
and creative community, the website says. 
We’re helping emerging artists turn their 
dreams into a reality. 

And for four months last summer, 
Yale undergraduate Geovanni “Geo” 
Barrios held the keys to Graduate New 
Haven’s studio and did just that, slipping 
behind those big double doors and that 
strange gold plaque.


G
eo’s tools and near-finished projects 
were scattered around the studio in a 
kind of frozen chaos. 

To my right: paintings and prints 
that I could barely make out from a 
dark corner. On an open shelf that split 
across the middle of the room: assorted 
blades, thick bundles of yarn, mason jars 
of handmade dyes. Then the floor: skinny 
birch trunks with the roots and branches 
amputated, their crowns decapitated 
too—really, just rough poles, bound by 
rope to one another in some abstract 
frame, a large wooden ‘X’ at its center. 
I watched Geo kneel on the floor, 
eyeing a tail of rope that dangled from 
the frame. “This one’s too long,” he said, 
holding it up so I could see. He kind of 
looked like a dad with his baseball cap, 
cargo shorts, and dark mustache. And it 
suited him, his relatively simple appear­
ance inside this busy room, against the 
overall noise of the Society’s kitsch 
marketing. Geo’s voice was easy to fol­
low, too—light, with a slight slowness 
that made his words feel more deliberate. 
It was the day before his capstone solo 
exhibition, and I think he was practic­
ing how he would finally speak to an 
audience. But at the moment, we were 
talking about the beginning. 

Last May, near the end of the school 
year, Geo still didn’t know what he was 
going to do over the summer. He’d been 
looking into art fellowships and other 
residencies, ways to spend time mak­
ing art without the pressure of needing 
to work. This was before he found the 
Sweet Dreams Society. By the time he 
did, the application—a video proposal—
was due in two days. 

“Two. Days.” He repeated to me. “I 
saw it, and I was like, holy shit.” Any 
longer, and the Society would’ve slipped 
away, unnoticed. 

Geo found the Sweet Dreams 
Society the same way I did: by chance, 
browsing in the back of the back room 
of the lobby of the Graduate Hotel 
on Chapel Street in New Haven, 
Connecticut. But Geo might not have 
found it without a little happenstance 
either—he didn’t have Wi-Fi where he 
lived, but the nearby Graduate did. With 
little time for planning, he grabbed his 
camera and recorded his application on 
the spot, describing a project of his that 
had never come to pass.


E
veryone’s an artist in some way, 
shape, or form. I believe.” 

His government name is Paul Blair. 
His professional name is DJ White 
Shadow. He’s got blue eyes, a healthy 
gray beard, and several black-ink tattoos 
that run down his arms to his fingers. DJ 
White Shadow is the type of guy that 
looks like he’s got a story or two, and he 
probably does, having produced the likes 
of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way and Artpop, 
and the 2002 Yu-Gi-Oh! theme song.


More 
importantly, 
DJ 
White 
Shadow is the founder of the Sweet 
Dreams Society. 

My first time seeing Blair is through 
a promotional video posted to the 
Graduate Hotel’s Instagram in December 
of 2021. He steps in front of an unassum­
ing white background, taking a seat on 
an unassuming white stool. The Sweet
Dreams residency, he says, is about space.


“I believe that in order to create the 
best product, you need to experiment 
with where you create. You need to 
be comfortable where you create. You 
need to create in a positive, uplifting 
environment.”


What matters to Blair aren’t just 
the spaces the artists are entering, but 
also the spaces they’re coming from. 
According to its online application, the 
Society seeks “artists with strong ties 
to the Graduate community they’re
applying for.” 

I found this confusing. 

Graduate is a hotel chain, with each 
of its thirty-three locations established 
specifically in college towns like Berkeley, 
Fayetteville, and New Haven. We are all 
students, its tagline declares. But I won­
dered why the Sweet Dreams Society 
lives out of a hotel chain of all places, 
where the idea of community becomes 
a nebulous, even secretive thing. After 
all, the only people consistently around 
are the ones clocking in and out for work, 
the people behind desks and counters 
and in employees-only back rooms. Then, 
there’s the fact that Graduate hotels are 
college town hotels, meaning the other

“consistent” presences are passersby, like 
visiting alums, students’ families, and 
tourists. And are New Haven locals also 
included in Graduate New Haven’s com­
munity, even without a reason to ever 
spend the night there?

I wondered what it meant for some­
one—for an artist—to be tied to a hotel 
community, anyway. 

In any case, Geo had solid enough 
ties to the Graduate community as 
someone living in New Haven, a student 
attending Yale, or a guy who regularly vis­
its the lobby to do work. Maybe a mix of 
everything. Looking at what had clearly 
been months of work in the studio—
the many careful knots of rope keeping 
his sculpture together—Geo proved 
himself well. Whether it be within the 
Graduate or Sweet Dreams or really 
any other community, I think Geo does 
have the ability to tether himself wher­
ever he’d like, if that was what he wanted. 
My question lies in how tight this tie 
to the Graduate community was and 
would continue to be, and what exactly
it looked like from both sides of the rope.

The backgrounds of the rest of Geo’s 
cohort continue to reveal how much 
more pliable the criteria of community 
can get. Already an upperclassman on 
academic leave, Geo’s the youngest res­
ident of the eight-member Summer ‘22 
cohort by about four or five years. He 
is this cohort’s only college student. 
Geographically speaking, the rest of the 
2022 cohort is a mix of bona fide locals, 
alumni of host towns’ associated schools, 
and total newcomers. As a whole, the 
Graduate and the Society’s community 
ties tangle into a knot. 

To be fair, the Sweet Dreams Society 
is still young. At the time of writing, it 
has recently opened the application for 
its Winter 2023 residency, which will 
be its third cohort of artists. Maybe the 
Society’s obscurity, both in reputation 
and logistics, is reasonably unintentional. 
But I still find this interesting with a fig­
ure like DJ White Shadow in charge. 
Then again, “We are all students,” 
said the tagline. The Society could still 
be learning how to emerge, too. 

Talking to DJ White Shadow is like 
talking to a quirky uncle. 
Though we were on a phone call 
between New Haven and Paris, I could 
almost hear the expressions he made as 
he spoke, the way his hands might’ve 
been waving around when he called peo­
ple he didn’t name directly “boneheads,” 
“total turds (to be frank),” and “full of 
shit.” Incredibly nice guy, though. 

“We’re trying to build something 
that’s emotional. Like, for lack of a bet­
ter word, very loving and tied to our 
surroundings.” He went on, “The basic 
ethos of the Sweet Dreams Society is 
that hotels are in the community, the 
hotel has space, and all the space in the 
hotel should be used—preferably for 
good rather than evil.” 

Paul laughed as he said this. 

It turns out, his tie to the Graduate 
community is a simple one: he’s been 
friends with the owner for about twenty 
years. And so he chose Graduate’s spaces 
for good because they both shared the 
idea that a hotel should serve the com­
munity it’s in. It was an easy choice to 
make. Paul’s goal with the Sweet Dreams 
Society, then, was to serve Graduate 
communities with spaces that their com­
munity members could create in. That 
is, with a private hotel chain’s private 
studios, which were often discovered by 
chance or word-of-mouth. 

Logistically, the Graduate makes 
perfect sense as the home of the Sweet 
Dreams Society. But in practice, at least 
in the practice of its marketing and pre­
sentation, I’m still unsure what to make 
of it. I remember, in particular, when 
Geo told me about friends who had 
passed by the Graduate without ever 
knowing he was working in a studio in 
the back—“You’re telling me you’ve been 
there? Every day, ten hours a day for the 
last four months, and we have never
been inside?”


The studios are for their communi­
ties. Their Graduate communities, spe­
cifically. But before anyone else, the keys 
belong to the artists. I had asked Geo 
if his time working in the studio felt 
influenced by Yale, perhaps the most 
present Graduate New Haven-related 
community sitting outside those doors. 
He shook his head no. 

“This is my space,” he’d said, looking 
over his projects and furniture and scraps 
of rope. He smiled. 

I am still unsure of what kind of 
artist community the Sweet Dreams 
Society aims to build from the already 
loose bounds of what makes the 
Graduate community. What would actu­
ally emerge if you combined, into one 
communal space, all ten of these isolated 
and far flung studios, the three to four 
months of personalized work from each 
artist, and the depth that would come 
with each of their solo exhibitions? 

I don’t doubt that Paul is making an 
honest effort. I’ve heard from Geo, and 
three other Sweet Dreams members, 
what a valuable time their residency has 
been in terms of their art, having a space 
of their own, and the validation of work­
ing with people at similar stages in their 
careers. 

“We have a lot of interactive fabric 
between the artists, and we encourage 
them to get to know each other. I try to 
put people in the same room, put them 
on the same call, put them in the same 
position,” Paul explained to me, “so they 
know, you know, you’re not the only 
weirdo in the world.”

A 
week and a half after Geo’s exhibi­
tion was the Sweet Dreams Society’s 
collective artist showcase. All eight of 
the Society’s 2022 cohort would finally 
convene in New York City, in Graduate 
Roosevelt Island’s Panorama Room. This 
was where I began to realize that maybe 
the Sweet Dreams Society and its collec­
tive identity, at large, aren’t supposed to 
make much sense. But I wanted to try to 
understand it anyway. 

The Society’s little gold plaque was 
almost as hard to find in the Roosevelt 
Island hotel as it was in New Haven—
behind the receptionist’s island counter 
in a small cubby of a hallway. But that 
night, the studio doors stayed shut. I 
walked just a bit further to the elevator, 
blocked off by velvet rope and a pair of 
security guards. I showed them my ID 
and they allowed me to ascend to the top 
floor. The elevator opened to more velvet 
rope and two people with a list, taking 
names by the door. 

I stepped into a rooftop bar. Geo’s 
work was the first thing I saw, but just a 
portion of what had been on display in 
New Haven: his three Riso prints on a 
small table and his AI Scout Badges, pro­
jected on the floor nearby. Right behind 
the projections was DJ White Shadow 
himself, working a DJ set from an ele­
vated booth. Despite the crowded bus­
tle of the bar and the music that was so 
loud that you had to yell if you wanted to 
talk with someone, he was cool, focused, 
and remarkably unnoticeable—I never 
would’ve guessed that he was the 
founder of all this. 

The rest of the showcase had been 
set up in a long, narrow lounge annexed 
from the rest of the bar. There, about 
three to four paintings from four dif­
ferent artists were intimately packed 
together, flanking both sides of me as 
I walked down to look. Still wearing 
my puffer coat from outside, I tried not 
to bump into the easels as I passed by 
(but this would happen anyway, multi­
ple times). Between these artists’ works, 
there was actually a fine amount of 
room. Just not enough to get the full 
picture of what they’d really done for 
all those months over the summer—
not unless you put in the effort to find
a closer look. 

Here were the artists of the Sweet 
Dreams Society, finally all together in 
this communal and surely bonding cel­
ebratory experience. But what seemed 
to have happened when they were put 
all together, at least to me, was that their 
community was too tightly-woven and 
too distant all at once; it was incredible 
to see all the different things they’d put 
together under the same mentor and 
in the same chain of hotels, from fiber 
installations to paintings to huge papier-
mâché sculptures, but each had taken a 
little of the focus away from its neigh­
bors, especially due to the hotel bar’s lack 
of dedicated space for the show. I saw 
a lot of the Sweet Dreams Society’s art, 
but I didn’t know how much I could see 
of the artists themselves. 

Everything from that entire sum­
mer of working away in privacy was 
finally out in the open. But as I sat in 
that little lounge, surrounded now by 
guests who seemed like they mostly 
came for the charcuterie board, their 
complimentary drinks from the bar 
in hand, I wondered what all of this 
was really for. The celebration of the 
work, or the act of the party? Maybe 
I wasn’t tied closely enough to their
community to know. 

The fifth display, at the end of the 
lounge, had a little more room and 
was intended to be an experience. Yen 
Azzaro’s ALTAR|ALTER is based on 
the Buddhist shrine of her childhood 
home. But rather than gifts for the spir­
its, Azzaro’s altar was filled with items 
related to survivors and victims of anti-
Asian hate crimes—a chunk of concrete, 
a knife, a target bag, a bottle of massage 
oil. There was also a bundle of incense 
for observers to “pray” with and leave in a 
bowl of rice. I grew up Buddhist too, and 
I thought this was beautiful. 

Azzaro couldn’t ship the original 
“altar” from Michigan, so what sat in 
front of me was a small table from the 
outside lounge, with some of the items 
on its surface while others were rele­
gated to the floor. Alongside those were 
vinyl signs with instructions on how to 
approach the exhibit. 

ALTAR|ALTER by YEN AZZARO.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Since I was at a rooftop bar, I kept 
my shoes on. But either way, it felt wrong 
to step on someone’s words, even if I 
was stepping on them to pray. When I 
held the incense between my palms and 
thought about the awful things that 
happened to these people, and what 
it must’ve been like to go to a studio 
every day and think about it even more, 
I got emotional. This didn’t last very
long though.

The club-style Lizzo remix booming 
over speakers snapped me out of it. 
I was hoping to just let you in on
my little world of crafts, but I was
convinced by a friend that you
might appreciate some footnotes.


**Getting back to New Haven**
**Page number(s): 61-62**

Getting back to New Haven was a 
fever dream. An all-nighter at my 
cousin’s place in Queens, a 5 a.m. F train, 
a 6 a.m. Metro-North train, and an 8 
a.m. Lyft to my 9 a.m. lecture. And the 
Yen Azzaro's modified ALTAR|ALTER exhibit.
entire time, I was still deciding whether 
or not I knew what the Sweet Dreams 
Society really was yet. Even now, I’m still 
thinking about it.

For a residency trying to push the 
work of unestablished artists into the 
world, the Society can be an enigma to 
outsiders like me, with its closed doors 
and private studios and obscure online 
marketing. To really understand what 
goes on in those studios, you need ties 
to the Graduate community. Specifically, 
you need to have ties to individuals 
in the Graduate community, or you 
might find yourself at a rooftop bar 
bumping into easels and wondering 
what was going through any of those 
creators’ heads for that whole sum­
mer of being a member of the Sweet
Dreams Society.

I was lucky to have ties to Geo. Since 
I saw his own little world of crafts before 
the Society would take it someplace 
bigger (not to mention, own the rights 
to those crafts afterwards), I saw what it 
did for him as an individual artist. He’d 
been given the space, time, and money 
to really flesh himself out, to continue 
emerging with an identity of his own. 
Morally Straight was powerful. And con­
fessional and eclectic and distinctly Geo. 
I am happy that this is a place in New 
Haven, now, for people to go and make 
this kind of thing happen. 

But there are still those unanswered 
questions for me about community. I 
wonder how the Sweet Dreams Society 
will continue to “learn as it goes” (says 
Paul), and how long it might take for 
it to emerge as the kind of community 
Paul wishes for it to be. I wonder, in the 
very back of my mind, if there was ever 
a concrete idea of a “Graduate commu­
nity,” or if it ever was possible to carve 
one out in the liminal bustle of a college 
town hotel.

If you find yourself in New Haven, I 
think it’s worth stopping by the Graduate. 
Again, on Chapel Street, across from 
Hull’s Art Supplies and the Yale School 
of Art—down the street from the Yale 
University Art Gallery, if that helps too. 
Walk into the lobby, and for the pur­
poses of this visit, poke around a little. 
Take in the kitsch furniture, the random 
Yale artifacts on the walls and shelves, 
the pizza payphone blocked off by a line 
of rental bikes. Go to the coffee bar, have 
that shot of espresso, and do some peo­
ple watching. Who’s working in there 
that day, and how many have migrated 
from the back room to the back of the 
back room? Or did the hotel close it off 
for a private event? 

If it’s open, definitely walk inside 
and look for the gold plaque. The doors 
to the studio will probably be locked, 
but they’re fun to look at when you take 
guesses at what could be behind them 
now, in the in-between of the summer 
residency and the winter residency to 
come. If it were me, I’d take guesses at 
what kind of person might get the keys 
next. I would also make guesses about 
the shape of the community sitting out­
side those doors, the community that 
would be sitting all around you. What 
are their ties here? Do they have any? 
Go to the Graduate. Find the studio. 
Figure it out for yourself, too. ∎

**The Farm**
**Author: Simon Billings**
**Page number(s): 62**

Jeremy smiles into the folds of his skin. 
Late October. He likes this time of year for 
its calm: “The grass here is just covering 
crop right now. The whole farm feels sort of 
tucked away.” We are cold, sweat-flecked and 
shivery. 

Today, it’s garlic. With the heels of our 
hands, we mash down on the bulbs and split 
cloves from roots. Then, we stake out little 
holes in the soil, ensconcing a clove every 
six inches. Occasionally, I de-glove one and 
slip it in my mouth. More than occasionally, 
I snack on Komachi turnips. Technically 
we get three each today. (But I’m compen­
sating for the total fools who don’t even try 
them. Like the fools who never wanted their 
daily Babybels: I used to do the rounds of 
the canteen, collecting desiderata. So more 
like seven.) I feed the chickens the roots of 
seven turnips before going back to the garlic 
columns. A greybeard once told me Farmers 
who wait until they finish their Beverly Gage 
papers never plant. He added, If they watch 
every cloud, they never harvest.

The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in history when people 
are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was presumably considered new. Wishing to 
share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. Besides, things seemed slow around here.”
Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. Two thousand five hundred 
copies of each issue are distributed free to members of the Yale and New Haven community. The New Journal is printed by TCI Press,
