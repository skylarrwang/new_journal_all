T
he studios are easy to miss. 
To find the one in New Haven, 
you have to go to the Graduate 
Hotel on Chapel Street, right across 
from the Yale School of Art. Walk 
through the doors, up a small flight of 
stairs and emerge into the lobby. Go 
past the mismatched sofas and armchairs, 
tacky wallpaper, and framed Yale para­
phernalia. Ignore the coffee counter—
even if that sharp whiff of freshly pulled 
espresso starts to draw you in. Go further, 
into the back room. Then the very back 
of the back room. 

If you see the small gold plaque by 
the wooden double doors, then you’ve 
found it. Graduate Dreams Society, it’ll say. 
That’s it.


I only found it because I was kind 
of forced to. There was a New Journal 
meeting in the back of the Graduate’s 
lobby for the design of the previous 
issue, and as a God-fearing Associate 
Editor of this magazine, I attended. But 
I didn’t know a thing about design, so 
my eyes wandered. I looked at lamps, 
then students staring at their laptops, 
then the big double doors. Then the 
shiny gold plaque right next to them.


I almost thought it was one of Yale’s 
secret societies.


A visit to the Sweet Dreams 
Society’s website is just about as vague as 
the plaque. The first thing to load on the 
screen is the all-seeing eye at the cen­
ter, just above the words “Dulce Fomnii,” 
which could mean “sweet dreams” in 
Latin if “Fomnii” wasn’t one letter 
away from “somnii,” the actual word for 
“dream”. This could’ve been a mistake in 
transcription—a version of the letter ‘s’ 
in Old English and Roman cursive can 
easily be confused for a lowercase ‘f.’ But 
to really learn about the Sweet Dreams 
Society, you have to move your cursor 
until the link to the About page presents 
itself in the top left corner of the screen. 
Turns out, my guess about the Society 
was close. Those big double doors are 
the entrance to an art studio, one of 
ten tucked away in select Graduate
Hotels across the country.


The Graduate Sweet Dreams Society is 
an immersive artist-in-residence program 
and creative community, the website says. 
We’re helping emerging artists turn their 
dreams into a reality. 

And for four months last summer, 
Yale undergraduate Geovanni “Geo” 
Barrios held the keys to Graduate New 
Haven’s studio and did just that, slipping 
behind those big double doors and that 
strange gold plaque.


G
eo’s tools and near-finished projects 
were scattered around the studio in a 
kind of frozen chaos. 

To my right: paintings and prints 
that I could barely make out from a 
dark corner. On an open shelf that split 
across the middle of the room: assorted 
blades, thick bundles of yarn, mason jars 
of handmade dyes. Then the floor: skinny 
birch trunks with the roots and branches 
amputated, their crowns decapitated 
too—really, just rough poles, bound by 
rope to one another in some abstract 
frame, a large wooden ‘X’ at its center. 
I watched Geo kneel on the floor, 
eyeing a tail of rope that dangled from 
the frame. “This one’s too long,” he said, 
holding it up so I could see. He kind of 
looked like a dad with his baseball cap, 
cargo shorts, and dark mustache. And it 
suited him, his relatively simple appear­
ance inside this busy room, against the 
overall noise of the Society’s kitsch 
marketing. Geo’s voice was easy to fol­
low, too—light, with a slight slowness 
that made his words feel more deliberate. 
It was the day before his capstone solo 
exhibition, and I think he was practic­
ing how he would finally speak to an 
audience. But at the moment, we were 
talking about the beginning. 

Last May, near the end of the school 
year, Geo still didn’t know what he was 
going to do over the summer. He’d been 
looking into art fellowships and other 
residencies, ways to spend time mak­
ing art without the pressure of needing 
to work. This was before he found the 
Sweet Dreams Society. By the time he 
did, the application—a video proposal—
was due in two days. 

“Two. Days.” He repeated to me. “I 
saw it, and I was like, holy shit.” Any 
longer, and the Society would’ve slipped 
away, unnoticed. 

Geo found the Sweet Dreams 
Society the same way I did: by chance, 
browsing in the back of the back room 
of the lobby of the Graduate Hotel 
on Chapel Street in New Haven, 
Connecticut. But Geo might not have 
found it without a little happenstance 
either—he didn’t have Wi-Fi where he 
lived, but the nearby Graduate did. With 
little time for planning, he grabbed his 
camera and recorded his application on 
the spot, describing a project of his that 
had never come to pass.


E
veryone’s an artist in some way, 
shape, or form. I believe.” 

His government name is Paul Blair. 
His professional name is DJ White 
Shadow. He’s got blue eyes, a healthy 
gray beard, and several black-ink tattoos 
that run down his arms to his fingers. DJ 
White Shadow is the type of guy that 
looks like he’s got a story or two, and he 
probably does, having produced the likes 
of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way and Artpop, 
and the 2002 Yu-Gi-Oh! theme song.


More 
importantly, 
DJ 
White 
Shadow is the founder of the Sweet 
Dreams Society. 

My first time seeing Blair is through 
a promotional video posted to the 
Graduate Hotel’s Instagram in December 
of 2021. He steps in front of an unassum­
ing white background, taking a seat on 
an unassuming white stool. The Sweet
Dreams residency, he says, is about space.


“I believe that in order to create the 
best product, you need to experiment 
with where you create. You need to 
be comfortable where you create. You 
need to create in a positive, uplifting 
environment.”


What matters to Blair aren’t just 
the spaces the artists are entering, but 
also the spaces they’re coming from. 
According to its online application, the 
Society seeks “artists with strong ties 
to the Graduate community they’re
applying for.” 

I found this confusing. 

Graduate is a hotel chain, with each 
of its thirty-three locations established 
specifically in college towns like Berkeley, 
Fayetteville, and New Haven. We are all 
students, its tagline declares. But I won­
dered why the Sweet Dreams Society 
lives out of a hotel chain of all places, 
where the idea of community becomes 
a nebulous, even secretive thing. After 
all, the only people consistently around 
are the ones clocking in and out for work, 
the people behind desks and counters 
and in employees-only back rooms. Then, 
there’s the fact that Graduate hotels are 
college town hotels, meaning the other
