Points of Departure
these flavors, their vision gets a little bit
more open about certain things,” she said.
In Whale Tea on Whitney Avenue, 
couples sipped each other’s drinks and 
groups of friends studied the complex 
menu together as I spoke with Jessie 
Cheung ’24. Cheung is familiar with 
how boba functions both as a business 
and a social setting. She is from Dallas, 
where her family opened Texas’s first 
ViVi Bubble Tea franchise. They have 
since helped establish three ViVi stores 
across the state. Cheung points to a ris­
ing interest in East Asian food and cul­
ture, sometimes referred to as the Hallyu 
Wave, as one reason for the rise in
boba consumption.
“Asian culture is now so much more 
prolific, especially with the popularity 
of Korean culture,” Cheung said. “So 
a lot of people have been starting to 
engage with boba because it’s so easy. It’s 
like, instead of getting a coffee, which 
is a very American thing, you can just
get a drink.”
It is boba’s ambiguous identity as an 
“Asian” drink, now mutated into some­
thing unquestionably American, that 
makes it so interesting to me. While 
boba is now “easy” to consume, (conve­
nient and ubiquitous and, God forbid, 
“trendy”) it contains so much baggage. 
Some Asian-Americans have started 
using the phrase “lunchbox moment” to 
describe the times when we opened our 
lunch boxes full of kimchi and gyoza 
and curry and fried rice and glass noo­
dles, and were met with caterwauls of “It 
stinks!” or “Ew, what is that?” Drinking 
boba in the presence of people who 
didn’t know what it was used to be a 
textbook lunchbox moment. Now, every­
one is drinking boba.
My friend Shane Zhang ’25, remem­
bers getting boba with his friends almost 
every Friday in high school. When 
he drank boba, he said, it was a way of 
enjoying a quasi-Asian drink that was 
palatable to non-Asian friends.
“It’s like I’m Colossus of Rhodes—I 
straddle two worlds,” he said. “My balls 
hang in the balance.”
I thought of the mythical statue 
at Rhodes, presiding over intercultural 
trade and commerce, and about boba, 
trapped between cultures today. As a cul­
tural export, as a marker of the migration 
of people and labor from Asia, boba does 
hang in the balance. Not quite one world, 
not quite the other.
In many ways, Loose Leaf’s mar­
keting and naming seems to be a per­
fect example of the evolution of what 
the concept of “tea” means, from Asia to 
America, from 1906 to 2022, through a 
twisting gyre of time and space, to end 
up in the plastic plant wall of a Loose 
Leaf in New Haven, Connecticut.
Boba, when it first came to the U.S., 
was categorized by the artificial powders, 
colors, and flavors that Loose Leaf now 
disavows. While perhaps the moralizing 
question of authenticity—whether or not 
the evolution of boba has been a “good” 
or “bad” thing—is unimportant, what is 
notable is understanding its journey: as a 
commodity, the vast distance it has trav­
eled; as a cultural practice and tradition, 
the long span of time it has endured. My 
feelings about boba are complicated—it 
feels good to know that American people 
are accepting of a drink with Taiwanese 
origins, that they would be willing to 
try a beverage with pandan in it. But I 
think about telling myself comforting 
pieties in the acceptance of boba’s pop­
ularity, that I might just have to accept 
the fact that I will feel conflicted about 
white people drinking boba, unaware of
its larger history, for the rest of my life.
During my brief tenure at Loose 
Leaf, I had to remake many drinks. I 
would pour out the drink in the sink, 
milks of all colors swirling down the 
drain, down into the belly of the hidden 
sewer system. The boba would be left 
behind, sticky balls clumping up at the 
drain. I had to stick my hand directly 
into the ballish void to force them down 
the drain, which was always a slightly 
repulsive but nonetheless deeply satisfy­
ing feeling.
I remember my fists full of boba, cup­
ping humanity’s tapioca in my teacup of
a hand. Then I squished them down. ∎
