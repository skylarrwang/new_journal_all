Points of Departure
Studio Haven
“Y
ou see the Apple Store, you see 
L.L.Bean, then you see a black ass 
store, it’s painted black, it looks creepy 
as fuck from the outside. It’s kinda like 
a candy shop, it’s enticing, you’ve gotta 
look in there,” said Palayo Mais, a mul­
timedia artist from New Haven and a 
regular at the Neville Wisdom Fashion
Design Studio.


I spoke with Palayo soon after my 
first visit to the Neville Wisdom studio. 
Before then, I hadn’t spent much time 
perusing the Broadway conglomerates, 
and the name “Neville Wisdom” did lit­
tle to elucidate the purpose of this enig­
matic store. From the words “WHERE 
ARE 
YOUR 
CLOTHES 
MADE?” 
written in big black letters in the tinted 
storefront window, decorated with man­
nequins sporting cocktail dresses and 
streetwear, I could only guess it was 
another one of Broadway’s many high-
priced clothing boutiques. 


What I didn’t know at first was that 
behind the dressy storefront, under­
cover in a sea of corporate strongholds, 
resides the Neville Wisdom Fashion 
Design Studio, a nucleus and safe haven 
for creatives throughout the city. Its 
leading creator and businessperson 
Dwayne Moore Jr. invited me to see
the space myself. 


Dwayne’s relationship with Neville 
Wisdom, after whom the store is named, 
is tightly knit, sewn with years of built 
trust and patience. In just about five 
years, Dwayne went from serendipi­
tously wandering into Neville’s studio 
to recently becoming a partner at the 
business. Starting out as an apprentice 
to Neville, Dwayne developed skills he 
can put to practice as part of the studio’s 
business and as part of his own brand. 
Together, Neville and Dwayne’s income 
is largely made of clothing alterations 
and commissions.


As Dwayne now continues to take 
a more administrative role, Neville 
Wisdom transitions into retirement. 
I couldn’t reach Neville himself for 
this article, as he was on a boat in the 
Caribbean and had lost his phone.


Dwayne gave me a look inside what 
he describes as his second home. 
“This is the space that keeps [the 
studio] alive for the most part,” Dwayne 
said as he led me to the back half of the 
studio. Behind the storefront manne­
quins is a regiment of industrial sew­
ing machines and an artillery of fabrics, 
much of it accumulated thanks to the 
community of local donors that Neville 
himself has established throughout his 
career. Overlooking the studio is a five-
foot tall multimedia portrait of Neville, 
with a black and white base and colorful 
cloth embellishments. Even further back, 
through a narrow hallway overtaken by 
old sewing experiments and works in 
progress is the store’s photography space. 
In this studio, shower thoughts become 
inventive clothing lines, gallery additions, 
and new prints.


“What pulls people in is the win­
dow and the ‘Made in New Haven’ sign,” 
Dwayne tells me. “I think that’s in part 
why people come in here, because it feels 
out of place.” That is, among the sur­
rounding chain stores that boast bright 
curated facades and imported goods, 
Neville Wisdom sticks out.


The Neville Wisdom studio is a 
playground for anyone with a vision. 
Those interested, like Palayo, pay a fee to 
use the space consistently, but all visitors 
are welcome. Drawn to the unique hand­
made pieces that Dwayne documented 
online, Palayo brought himself through 
the doors of the Neville Wisdom
studio to discover what he described as 
a “bat cave.”


Palayo has found solidarity in the 
community Neville and Dwayne have 
built. Some days Palayo leaves with 
armfuls of clothes from Dwayne’s per­
sonal line. One time, Dwayne gave 
Palayo a spare camera to help with his 
photography endeavors. Palayo can 
spend hours at the studio, where he and 
Dwayne will work in the hum of sew­
ing machines and R&B, reflecting on 
each other’s projects, lives, and anything 
else that comes to mind. To Palayo, the 
studio is a sanctuary, a place grounded 
in creativity and camaraderie that has 
been conducive to his growth as an
individual and artist.


Dwayne and I flipped through cata­
logs and portfolios of local New Haven 
artists whose books were proudly dis­
played on the store’s shelves. Meanwhile, 
he told me about a well-meaning cus­
tomer who had reminded him of the 
trials he would experience, especially as 
a Black artist and businessman. Sharing 
racial identity, the customer had told 
Dwayne to be wary of the personalities 
he would meet given his business and 
given its location. “You sound like my 
mom,” Dwayne had laughed, dismissing 
the concern. Negative attention, if any, is 
hardly an issue to him because the indi­
viduals that naturally gravitate toward the 
Neville Wisdom studio are the types of
people he’d want to associate with anyway.


 “The way the front is set up, it’s as if 
only the people I think I would engage 
with come in here. I feel like looking at 
this place you have to be open to wanna 
even come in.” As many new faces as 
he sees, Dwayne feels a strong sense of 
community at the studio, between New 
Haven being his home and the store­
front drawing in like-minded people. 
“You’re already curious,” he said. “I like 
to talk to curious minds.” Dwayne told 
me that the first time he landed outside 
Neville Wisdom’s door he was reading a 
book called Curious Minds, and we mar­
veled at the full-circle moment.


A few times in our conversation, 
Dwayne shifted his attention to help­
ing another studio regular perfect a 
waistband on a pair of shorts. The fab­
ric he was working with was one of his 
own designs, a quadriptych featuring 
the band Kiss. In the closing hours we 
spent talking, a handful of visitors leaked 
in and out of the studio, some custom­
ers and local creators looking to take 
their ideas through the finish line. In the 
Neville Wisdom studio, the storefront 
and the design studio exist in symbiosis.


To Dwayne, his responsibilities in 
the studio are not a clock-in, clock-out 
ordeal—they’re lifestyle, an extension 
of his being. In his eyes, the studio is as 
much a workshop as it is a home. “Some 
nights I’ll just sleep on that couch right 
over there,” Dwayne gestured to the 
satin couch where my coat and tote bag 
were resting.


By many standards, New Haven is 
not the ideal spot for exercising creative 
visions. Palayo believes that the art traf­
fic in New Haven is “nonexistent,” as a 
product of the population and the lack 
of diversity. In New Haven, the culture 
does not seem to demand novelty like 
other larger cities, where the movement 
of people isn’t defined by a monopolizing 
private institution. Meanwhile, Dwayne 
sees the market differently, “It can feel 
small, but I think I’d feel smaller in any 
other city to be fair. It’s about connecting 
with the people who you think resonate 
with you. It depends on how you look
at it for sure.”


“[My] favorite part [is] how open 
it is. In a literal sense and also how 
people perceive it when they walk in. I 
think I like that so much because I’ve 
experienced that exclusivity from peo­
ple not wanting to teach me,” Dwayne 
reflected on the studio’s function in 
the community. “The fashion industry 
seems so exclusive, but we’re more than 
welcome to anyone that wants to be
a part of this.”


The 
Neville 
Wisdom 
Fashion 
Design Studio has taken a new shape 
over the years, especially as a result of 
the pandemic, and will continue to do 
so with the changing leadership, which 
Dwayne believes he can use to draw a 
youthful perspective and energy into the 
studio. The diversity of people and opin­
ions is what he believes will reignite the 
space. “I don’t see it going away or mov­
ing, as much as we downsize,” Dwayne 
asserts, “It says a lot about the useful­
ness to the community.” The studio is 
one-of-a-kind, a place providing people 
of all backgrounds and interests with 
a community that hardly says no and 
relentlessly gives. “In the industry you 
serve the person you work for, and the 
space,” Dwayne explained. “This space
serves me.” ∎
