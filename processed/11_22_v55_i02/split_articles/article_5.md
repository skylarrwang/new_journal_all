n John Cavaliere’s shaky iPhone 
recording of a late-summer rain­
storm in 2021, a manhole cover at the 
intersection of West Rock and Whalley 
Avenue has blown off, and become a 
spewing, 2-foot-high fountain. Water—
mired to an unsettling blackness—roils 
and sloshes against the side of his porch. 
The cars that manage to pass flash their 
emergency blinkers as they squelch 
through the flood, tires half submerged 
in the filthy mix of sewage and run­
off. Raindrops streak slantwise through 
the frame. The water is unstoppable;
the water is everywhere.
Cavaliere, owner of the antique 
shop Lyric Hall, has lived through vio­
lent floods for the past ten years. He has 
plenty of footage to show for it—videos 
of him trekking down the stairs in the 
middle of the night to find a pool of 
grayish water at calf-level in the base­
ment, lapping at wooden chair legs and 
picture frames. Along with the video 
clips, which he keeps in the hopes of 
showing the city officials, he’s typed up 
the measurements of every flood on a 
sheet of printer paper. “On May 7, 2011 
there was 3 feet. On August 15, 2012, 
there was 4 feet, 2 inches,” he reads. The 
numbers only grow, tending in the same 
direction as the sea levels in Long Island 
sound. “In July 2021, 6 feet, 5 inches. In 
September 2021, that was almost 7 feet.”
He sets the folded sheet on the 
wooden end table near the display 
window. The two of us are standing in 
Cavaliere’s small, one-story shop; it’s 
October, 2022. There’s a deep sigh. “[The 
floods have] taken out the HVAC [Heating, 
Ventilation, and Air Conditioning] sys­
tems, the heating [and] air conditioning 
systems, so many times I can’t keep up.” 
Cavaliere, who refurbishes old artwork 
and repairs gilded picture frames for a 
living, used to keep his workshop in the 
basement, until repeated flooding events 
forced him to relocate to the main floor. 
His gilt molds and picture frames now 
lie sprawled across a storefront table. He 
tries not to think of all the antiques and 
artworks he’s lost over the years.
Today, the store has no heating. 
Instead, Cavaliere uses a cast-iron wood 
stove squatting in the center of the room. 
He took the furnace out of the basement 
years ago, fearing that a flood might 
reach his home’s electrical panels. If any 
electrical panels got submerged and he 
accidentally stepped into the water, he 
explained, “I could get electrocuted.”
Cavaliere and his fellow Westville 
residents have watched these sewage 
overflows increase in frequency against 
a trend of rising sea levels and intensify­
ing storms. They’ve sent dozens of emails 
to state and local officials, which all go 
either largely unanswered or forwarded 
to other representatives. Just last month 
he sent a sample of floodwater from 
near the basement stairway to Baron 
Analytical Laboratories. The results came 
back the next day, concluding that fecal 
coliforms in the water “were too high to 
accurately count.” When the water dries, 
streets and sidewalks are left with toxic 
residue and bacteria. “In other words, 
you know, we could get E. coli, Hepatitis 
A, typhoid from all these microbes.”
Flooding has upended Cavaliere’s 
life. “It does something to you all these 
times,” he said. “It’s traumatic.”
C
ombined Sewer Overflow (CSO) 
is common in cities with older 
wastewater infrastructure, according to 
Colleen Murphy-Dunning, director of 
the Urban Resources Initiative (URI). 
Most infrastructure built throughout 
the mid-to-late 1800s was designed with 
a single sewage pipe. Waste from toi­
lets and bathtubs would combine with 
stormwater runoff and be transported to 
the processing facilities in East Shore.
The single pipe design quickly 
retired in the years following the 1970 
Clean Water Act, after officials realized 
that it was causing waste to be directly 
discharged into the rivers. During 
heavy rainstorms when the water vol­
ume exceeded carrying capacity, the 
single pipe system would resort to an 
“outfall”—a safety valve that expelled 
untreated sewage straight into the rivers. 
Cities like New Haven had been wash­
ing feces directly to the Long Island 
Sound. Under the Clean Water Act, 
this wastewater system would be legally 
required to improve.
At least, it was supposed to be. 
Despite the intentions of the Clean 
Water Act, New Haven has been 
slow to develop its infrastructure. 
Most of the city’s historic neighbor­
hoods—downtown, 
Wooster 
Square, 
Dixwell, Westville—continue to use the 
combined sewer system.
There are more immediate conse­
quences to the single pipe system than 
feces in the rivers. Faced with more sew­
age than it can handle, enough pressure 
builds up to pop manhole covers off and 
send its contents spilling all over the 
street. “It’s pretty nasty,” Chris Ozyck, 
URI’s associate director, said as we drove 
down Front Street in his pickup. He 
pointed out the townhouse complexes 
on the slope to our right, where storm­
water often rushes down and over­
whelms the pipes. As it moves downhill, 
the sewage-runoff mixture often gets 
backed up near low-lying areas and 
floods the streets.
Like most historic urban areas, not 
all of New Haven’s 555 mile-long sew­
age system is the same. Most streets 
constructed farther from downtown 
now use two pipes—one which spe­
cializes in collecting runoff stormwater 
from the catch-basins, and another that 
connects to each home’s sewage system. 
Doing so prevents the sewage flooding
from happening.
The situation in Newhallville, a 
neighborhood in New Haven’s Ward 22,
is one such instance of this. Though 
Ozyck told me that some basements in 
the neighborhood had been flooding, 
the culprit seems to be purely runoff 
for now. Most of Newhallville’s streets 
have two sewer pipes, which has so far 
spared its residents of the feces-laden 
horrors. Hunter Irwin, a local resident 
on Shelton Avenue, moved here for his 
job at Yale-New Haven Hospital during 
the beginning of the pandemic and has 
braved three years of unrelenting storms. 
He admitted that runoff stormwater can 
still be a problem—it collects on the 
curbside and the empty lot across the 
street, especially during late summer 
thunderstorms—but so far, it hasn’t been 
much of a concern.
Dawn Henning, a New Haven city 
engineer, said that the city has been 
working steadily to outfit older dis­
tricts with separate sewer pipes. That’s 
where URI has stepped in. As part of 
an effort to divert excess runoff from 
entering the sewage pipes, the nonprofit 
applied for grant funding and accepted 
contracts with the city government to 
install bioswales–trenches filled with 
shrubs and vegetation that receive runoff 
With water levels rising, the observation deck at the end of Clifton Street in Fair Haven is crumbling into the sound.
