EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
After a month of back and forth, Victor 
offered to drive up to meet us at the Middletown 
church. Sitting at the back of a white and beige 
meeting room with several rows of seats, the pas­
tor of the Church, a tall, ever-smiling Korean 
man who later called himself the “selfie king,” 
brought out a tray of snacks. He set up a screen 
at the front of the room and began screening half 
an hour of videos about the Church including 
dozens of videos of church members across the 
world gathered in large groups, smiling, wav­
ing, and exclaiming “We love you!” As we were 
leaving, after asking us to take a selfie with him, 
the “selfie king” gave us goodie bags filled with 
baked goods, a mug inscribed with a Bible verse, 
and a note that ended with another “We love 
you.” Victor’s story is familiar. He first joined the 
Church as a 20-year-old college student in 2005 
in Bogota, New Jersey. He was invited to a Bible 
study after soccer practice. He said he’d tried 
out several churches prior to joining the World 
Mission Society, but found that many churches 
did not “practice what they preached,” including 
the Catholic church in which he grew up. Once 
he saw the “evidence” from the Bible about the 
Sabbath, he knew the Church of God was “dif­
ferent”. (The evidence: Mark 16:1 states “Saturday 
evening, when the Sabbath ended.”)


Victor was baptized a few days after his first 
Bible study.


Ava, whose name has been changed to pro­
tect her identity, is a former member who was 
in the Church for about two months. She, like 
Kelsey, was baptized at her first Bible study, 
but she had not been told almost anything 
about the Church’s beliefs. According to Kelsey, 
once you are baptized by the Church, you’re
considered a member.


When the World Mission Society first 
approached her, Ava had just graduated college. 
Two women around her age approached her in 
the Christian aisle of a bookstore. At the time, 
she had been interested in learning more about 
Christianity, so when the women asked her to 
join them for a Bible study, she agreed to go the 
next day, despite the women urging her to follow 
them into a car immediately.


When she went to the Church, Ava noticed 
photos of Zahng on the walls and accepted 
their explanation that that was God the Mother. 
Looking back, she chalks this up to naivety. At 
the end of the Bible study, she was taken to a 
separate room of the house with a tub, where 
she was submerged underwater. “It seemed like a 
normal Bible study, nothing out of the ordinary,” 
she said. “I liked what I heard, so they asked me 
if I wanted to get baptized, and that’s something
I actually regret.”


The feeling of regret kept coming up 
throughout our conversation with Ava. She had 
joined the Church and allowed herself to be bap­
tized because she was genuinely interested in 
Christianity. Later, she learned that the Christian 
leaders condemn World Mission Society as a 
cult, and this made her wonder if she had tainted 
herself. “I regretted [the baptism] very much. I 
felt like what have I done? How did I ruin my 
chances to get to heaven?” Baptizing members 
before they’re devoted is a way to make them feel 
committed to the Church quickly. At the time, 
though, she believed the group when they told 
her she had to be baptized in order to see salva­
tion, so that Saturday she returned to the house 
for World Mission Society’s day of sabbath where 
they worshiped and studied the Bible nonstop—
it felt like “cramming for an exam.” Everyone was 
cooped up in the house from morning until night, 
breaking only for meals.


“We spent the entire day at that house and it 
was exhausting,” Ava said in an almost confes­
sionary tone. She felt almost guilty that she had 
allowed herself to be baptized, and kept apol­
ogizing for how “ignorant” she had been about 
religion at the time. “I’m going to be honest with 
you, it’s an experience I’ve never experienced 
before. At the end of that day, it felt like a phys­
ical change happening, like [my brain] was being 
reworked and reformed.”


Over time, however, questions began to pop 
up. She had contributed to gifts and monetary 
donations for “the heavenly mother” in South 
Korea, and the Church had played a “thank you” 
message from God the Mother at the next service. 
Ava wondered why, if the woman in South Korea 
was God, she only responded by nodding and 
smiling, and could not respond in English. She’d 
also seen mentions of Ahn Sahng-hong as the 
second coming of Christ on the internet—some­
thing the Church hadn’t mentioned to her at all—
which she brought up at one of the Bible studies. 
To each of her questions, Ava said she was only 
told by the members conducting the Bible study 
that she was “ignorant,” “dumb,” and should not 
have “read ahead.”


She eventually left and joined a Methodist 
church. She told us that she wants to get re-bap­
tized to “wash away” what happened. She felt 
“betrayed” by the two women from the bookstore, 
whom she had considered her friends.


Kelsey, too, described her baptism as an 
uncomfortable experience.


“They didn’t tie my hands and throw me into 
a bathtub,” Kelsey said. “But the thing is, I don’t 
believe that I had the information necessary to 
really make the choice on my own, because they 
were not forthcoming with all the stuff that was 
going to be required of me.” Both Kelsey and 
Ava told us that the intimate space where their 
baptisms took place and the group of people that 
surrounded them made them feel pressured to 
agree to the baptism. “They tell you in order to be 
saved and enter the kingdom of heaven, you have 
to be baptized and they show a verse in the Bible 
that says you don’t know what’s going to hap­
pen tomorrow,” Kelsey added. “So there’s some
element of fear tactics as well.”

Anthony recalled being similarly baptized 
at his first Bible study. He felt like he had been 
misled. He was not religious at all before joining 
the Church, did not have any experience and had 
little knowledge of baptism, and was told that he 
would just “get a little wet.” Instead, he was led 
to a room where he was asked to take off all his 
clothes and change into a robe. He kneeled down 
while a group of about five people prayed over 
him—it felt like a “whirlwind.”


“In my mind, it was a ceremony where maybe 
they sprinkle water and then that’s really the end 
of it,” Anthony said. “But they ended up making 
me walk up to a room, where they told me I had 
to take off all my clothes and put on a robe and 
I felt like that was deceptive . . . But I already felt 
this peer pressure, these people are all excited and 
surrounding me excited that I’m going to be bap­
tized . . . what am I supposed to do?”


Victor told us that the immediacy of baptism 
within the Church is based on their commitment 
to following the Bible. “In the Bible, every bap-
tism was immediate. There is no record of a
baptism being delayed by six months or a year, so 
it is taught in the Bible that if someone wants to 
be baptized, they can do it the same day.”


A
t the end of November, a month after we’d 
sat down with Victor, we wrote him with 
a list of the allegations former members had 
brought forward—allegations that had “legal 
implications” according to his reply. The next 
day, we received an email with fifty member 
testimonies attached as letters mostly addressed 
to “whom it may concern.” These letters, fea­
turing the writers’ first and last names, detailed 
their positive experiences with the Church. In 
Victor’s words, “with over 4,000,000 members 
worldwide everyone has different experiences, 
and to write a story about our Church only from 
the perspective of “former members,” its unfair 
to all the members who currently attend the 
Church, and whose lives have improved since 
having joined the Church.”


A member of the Church for seventeen 
years, Zuley Polanco, described how her hus­
band, whom she had met while at college, even­
tually began attending the Church with her. “We 
got married and for a long time I attended the 
Church of God alone which was never a problem 
but I still wanted him to be a part of this beau­
tiful organization,” she wrote. “So, I invited him 
to one of the many events held at the church 
and he was very impressed by how much the 
Church of God does for the community and the
countries around the world.”


Another member, Youngbae Song, who has 
attended the Church since 2007, wrote that the 
Church helped him to understand the “impor­
tance” of keeping God’s commands: “I realized 
that no other churches I attended were actually 
following the teachings of God in the bible, but 
practice many pagan customs.”


Youngbae described how the Catholic mother 
of one member called her daughter and decided 
to visit the Church because her Catholic priest 
had said to their parish: “if you want to believe 
in God, you should be like the members of the 
Church of God.”


“It is a miracle!” Youngbae wrote. “Many co 
workers and family members came to Church of 
God because they realized how much the mem­
bers who attended had changed for the better 
after attending the church.”


Many of the other testimonies read with the 
same zeal, describing how the Church changed 
members for the better, and that their spiritual 
change compelled friends and family to attend 
too. Many of them describe their former selves, 
before joining the Church, as selfish or lost; after 
joining the Church, Ivan Diaz wrote that he 
began helping out around the house and became 
a more positive person. Several mention finding 
the “truth”—sometimes with a capital “T”—
through the Church. Although the accounts 
represent the variety of experiences within the 
Church—many of which, according to Victor, 
dispute the claims of former members—there 
are some elements that connect the testimo­
nies to each other and to those of former mem­
bers. The recruitment that Kelsey, Anthony, and 
George describe is reminiscent of Pablo Chavez, 
who “could not help but to invite” his family, 
friends, coworkers, and classmates to the Church 
and Naomi Timmons who realized that “every­
one must know about and come to this church!” 
Time spent at the Church that would stretch 
past midnight each day is described by Saira 
Ahmed as the Church becoming her “home”—
“Day after day, no one needed to call me to ask 
if I was coming,” she wrote. Many described 
being disillusioned with other religions before 
finding the Church. Several of the members 
described having a family while in the Church, 
children who would attend Bible studies and 
Sabbath days and eventually begin preaching to 
others. Several of them described having spouses 
who weren’t originally in the Church—but all 
of them either ended up joining or separating, 
although one describes another member who is 
not a member of the Church. A few of them did 
describe learning about God the Mother early 
on. Several of the testimonies, like Jaewon Kim’s 
and Jenn Garcia’s, also describe joining the 
Church while in college, although they empha­
size that the Church did not interfere with their 
studies or extracurriculars.


One member, Ashley, graduated from Yale in 
May 2018 and worked at Yale from 2018 to 2020. 
While she was at Yale, she was not particularly 
interested in the Church, being more focused on 
her academic and professional goals. She recalled 
being introduced to the Church through two 
girls who approached her and her roommate at 
a mall: had she heard that the second coming 
of Christ had already come, they asked her. Not 


understanding the name “Ahn Sahng-hong,” she 
asked them to repeat it four times before feel­
ing “relieved” to learn that the reason she couldn’t 
understand it was because it was Korean. After 
a few Bible studies, Ashley was baptized—a rite 
in order for her to “keep the Passover and receive 
the promise of God.” The Church taught her that 
many of the things she thought she knew were 
not biblical: “I felt so hurt by all those churches 
that taught me those things that had nothing to 
do with what God commanded us. I felt lied to 
and I wanted to know the truth.”



The Church calls new recruits, people who 
attend at least one Bible study, “fruits.”


“Bearing fruit,” Kelsey said, meant bringing 
somebody to the Church who then gets baptized, 
and each fruit that a member “bears” earns them 
points at the main Church in South Korea. If a 
fruit begins contributing monetarily—through 
tithes and offerings—they are then called a “talent.”


Tom, whose name has been changed for pri­
vacy reasons, became involved almost seven years 
ago as a senior in high school when he was mes­
saged by a coworker he liked, asking if he would 
come to the Church of God. He didn’t think 
much of it, and saw it as an opportunity to get to 
know the girl and thought it could be interest­
ing. He said he found the people the Church uses 
for recruiting are either young college students
or attractive women.


About a week after she messaged him, he 
went to the Church, then only stayed in the 
Church for a few months, but he could already 
tell that something wasn’t right. 


Tom said the Bible studies seemed normal 
at first, although he did not have much religious 
experience, but he said things started becoming 
“weird” and “strange,” especially with the long 
church services and how he found members of 
the Church were “out of touch with reality” and 
“brainwash[ed].” 


They also encouraged him to not talk to peo­
ple who did not agree with the Church’s ideas, 
which he also found strange, and said they would 
“do anything they [could]” to get him to stay late 
at the services, leading him to often lie and tell 
leaders he was sick to get out of commitments 
for the Church.


“They don’t strike me as somebody that would, 
you know, hurt you physically, but they will do 
anything necessary to mentally convince you to 
stay,” Tom said.


I
n 2010, Kelsey said that the Church taught 
that the world would end in 2012 and that each 
member had to bring in ten talents in order to 
ensure their place in heaven. The Church called 
this the “ten talents movement.”


“It was so incredibly stressful, and meanwhile 
2012 passes and they said, ‘Mother’s giving us 
more time to bear the ten talents,’” Kelsey said. 
“2012 comes and goes and we’re still here, and the 
Church backtracks and says, ‘We never taught 
that the end of the world was going to happen.’” 
(Members had been taught to physically prepare 
for the end of the world by buying an army duf­
fle bag, a month’s worth of food, and a month’s 
worth of water.) But the Church was still expect­
ing its members to recruit.


The Church, allegedly, would simply move 
the date of destruction further back. 2014, the fif­
tieth anniversary of the Church, was the next date, 
and when that passed, they said the world would 
end in 2018. They stressed that members should 
be ready for the world to end at any moment, and 
they should prepare by devoting themselves com­
pletely to the Church.


“If Father comes tonight, you want to be 
found doing the gospel work,” Kelsey said. “They 
had it in your mind that Ahn Sahng-hong could 
come back at any moment and destroy the whole 
world, and they would tell us that you need to 
be prepared to watch your children die in front
