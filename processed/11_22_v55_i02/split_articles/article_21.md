On the day after the shivering Jews 
weep at God. February’s wormy grass 
stomped on by their shovels, digging down past 
him, burying us both, getting us confused.
My mother’s tongue in a knot on a word
I typed at the dinner table for her.
Then my turn. I adjust my father, slur
across the bad years. No mourner here’s heard
how I wrote this tribute: three days ago
I iced the shower water to blue-lipped
and knew that he would die. It made me trip
and twist into the bath curtains. Out flowed
the little I knew in him. Only then
could my father’s fatherhood ink my pen.


**Friday night**

It is Friday night. No date. 
Any Friday night you want. 
I am playing chess with my Dad 
after we get back from the synagogue 
and before we eat dinner. 
I am chuckling as my Dad 
recycles old jokes. 
My favorite one he tells: 
“You can pick your friends and
you can pick your nose but
you can’t pick your friend’s nose.”
I am a child. Any age you want but a child.
after dinner and before we go to bed. 
He usually falls asleep in the 
middle. I keep the game
up, play on his behalf, 
moving the black pieces now too. 
I don’t blame him. I don’t.


**God is not dead, God is just a loser**
**Author: Paola Santos**

God is not dead, god just lost someone he never had 
God is not dead, god is a glass cabinet of possibilities 
God is not dead, god is a 42nd Street ceviche
God is not dead, god is a sickly sycamore and its offshoots 
God is not dead, god is my soup-scorched tongue
God is not dead, god’s just gargoyled and rusting 
God is not dead, god is no longer worried about the sriracha recall
God is not dead, god just grabbed a beer with a priest, a challah baker, and his Spectrum guy
God is not dead, god remembers the molting San Simeon seals
God is not dead, god’s just reeling with the neo-jackbooted noww
God is not dead, god brought his binoculars 
God is not dead, he’s just watching the birds 
The birds aren’t dead, 
they’re just watching god.

The stretch of sand between Lifeguard 
Towers 30 and 38 has seen my mom, my 
aunts, my sister, and me gain too many 
constellations of freckles to count. We 
store decade-old boogie boards and 
scratched-up beach pails up the block at 
the far end of the hallway in my grand­
parents’ apartment; the jury is still out on 
whether our gear is worn-in or worn-
down. My family insists on remind­
ing me that when we first moved from 
Managua to Los Angeles, I was none 
too fond of our coastal Californian after­
noons. I missed warm lake water and 
the tried-and-true stability of Marco 
Polo and a pool—and I made it every­
body’s business. I may have hated the 
lingering tendencies of sticky sand, but 
I soon learned to love the cold Pacific. 
I found cigarette butts, sandcrabs, and 
claw machine treasures all in scoops of 
sandy mud. I held open houses for my 
drip-dry castles, I chased down kites, I 
poked my mom for another ziplock bag 
of grapes or goldfish. I bugged my dad 
and older sister to brave the waves with 
me, arm-in-arm.
have transformed Connecticut into one 
of the most exclusionary shorelines in 
the country.
24 of Connecticut’s 169 cities and 
towns border the Long Island Sound. 
Over half of Connecticut’s population 
lives in coastal zones defined by these cit­
ies’ borders. Across the state, municipal 
beaches have curbed non-resident access 
to their shores by charging skyrocket­
ing rates for seasonal passes. Westport, 
for example, charges out-of-towners 
over fifteen times more for beach park­
ing than its residents—$50 a season for 
residents and $775 for everyone else. In 
Stamford, residents pay a flat rate of $26 
a season while non-residents pay the 
town $292. New Haven’s beaches hold 
some of the state’s least financial restric­
tions—with the famed Lighthouse Point 
Park charging non-residents $25 per day 
or $100 for the summer season. But just 
a few miles away, West Haven keeps the 
bar to entry high, requiring non-res­
idents to pay more than double New 
Haven’s ask, at $250 for the season. 
“Connecticut beaches are gated in 
ways that should be offensive to every 
resident of one of those towns,” said New 
Haven and East Haven Connecticut 
State Representative Roland Lemar, on 
a call with me in late September. “In 
essence, too many public beaches in 
Connecticut have become country clubs.”
Exclusionary beach fees render the 
coast economically inaccessible to all but 
Connecticut’s beaches are grassy 
by comparison. From the Waterford 
Beach dunes to the Calf Pasture pier, the 
state’s 338 miles of jetty-ridden shoreline 
stretch into the cold Atlantic. This past 
summer, however, I learned just how 
hard it is to visit Connecticut’s beaches: 
throughout the state, local restrictions 
Rosy gray and hazy
blue Venice Beach days 
have marked nearly 
every week of the last 
fifteen years of my life.
