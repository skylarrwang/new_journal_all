EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Since I was at a rooftop bar, I kept 
my shoes on. But either way, it felt wrong 
to step on someone’s words, even if I 
was stepping on them to pray. When I 
held the incense between my palms and 
thought about the awful things that 
happened to these people, and what 
it must’ve been like to go to a studio 
every day and think about it even more, 
I got emotional. This didn’t last very
long though.

The club-style Lizzo remix booming 
over speakers snapped me out of it. 
I was hoping to just let you in on
my little world of crafts, but I was
convinced by a friend that you
might appreciate some footnotes.


**Getting back to New Haven**
**Page number(s): 61-62**

Getting back to New Haven was a 
fever dream. An all-nighter at my 
cousin’s place in Queens, a 5 a.m. F train, 
a 6 a.m. Metro-North train, and an 8 
a.m. Lyft to my 9 a.m. lecture. And the 
Yen Azzaro's modified ALTAR|ALTER exhibit.
entire time, I was still deciding whether 
or not I knew what the Sweet Dreams 
Society really was yet. Even now, I’m still 
thinking about it.

For a residency trying to push the 
work of unestablished artists into the 
world, the Society can be an enigma to 
outsiders like me, with its closed doors 
and private studios and obscure online 
marketing. To really understand what 
goes on in those studios, you need ties 
to the Graduate community. Specifically, 
you need to have ties to individuals 
in the Graduate community, or you 
might find yourself at a rooftop bar 
bumping into easels and wondering 
what was going through any of those 
creators’ heads for that whole sum­
mer of being a member of the Sweet
Dreams Society.

I was lucky to have ties to Geo. Since 
I saw his own little world of crafts before 
the Society would take it someplace 
bigger (not to mention, own the rights 
to those crafts afterwards), I saw what it 
did for him as an individual artist. He’d 
been given the space, time, and money 
to really flesh himself out, to continue 
emerging with an identity of his own. 
Morally Straight was powerful. And con­
fessional and eclectic and distinctly Geo. 
I am happy that this is a place in New 
Haven, now, for people to go and make 
this kind of thing happen. 

But there are still those unanswered 
questions for me about community. I 
wonder how the Sweet Dreams Society 
will continue to “learn as it goes” (says 
Paul), and how long it might take for 
it to emerge as the kind of community 
Paul wishes for it to be. I wonder, in the 
very back of my mind, if there was ever 
a concrete idea of a “Graduate commu­
nity,” or if it ever was possible to carve 
one out in the liminal bustle of a college 
town hotel.

If you find yourself in New Haven, I 
think it’s worth stopping by the Graduate. 
Again, on Chapel Street, across from 
Hull’s Art Supplies and the Yale School 
of Art—down the street from the Yale 
University Art Gallery, if that helps too. 
Walk into the lobby, and for the pur­
poses of this visit, poke around a little. 
Take in the kitsch furniture, the random 
Yale artifacts on the walls and shelves, 
the pizza payphone blocked off by a line 
of rental bikes. Go to the coffee bar, have 
that shot of espresso, and do some peo­
ple watching. Who’s working in there 
that day, and how many have migrated 
from the back room to the back of the 
back room? Or did the hotel close it off 
for a private event? 

If it’s open, definitely walk inside 
and look for the gold plaque. The doors 
to the studio will probably be locked, 
but they’re fun to look at when you take 
guesses at what could be behind them 
now, in the in-between of the summer 
residency and the winter residency to 
come. If it were me, I’d take guesses at 
what kind of person might get the keys 
next. I would also make guesses about 
the shape of the community sitting out­
side those doors, the community that 
would be sitting all around you. What 
are their ties here? Do they have any? 
Go to the Graduate. Find the studio. 
Figure it out for yourself, too. ∎
