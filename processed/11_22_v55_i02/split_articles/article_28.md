**The Farm**
**Author: Simon Billings**

Jeremy smiles into the folds of his skin. 
Late October. He likes this time of year for 
its calm: “The grass here is just covering 
crop right now. The whole farm feels sort of 
tucked away.” We are cold, sweat-flecked and 
shivery. 

Today, it’s garlic. With the heels of our 
hands, we mash down on the bulbs and split 
cloves from roots. Then, we stake out little 
holes in the soil, ensconcing a clove every 
six inches. Occasionally, I de-glove one and 
slip it in my mouth. More than occasionally, 
I snack on Komachi turnips. Technically 
we get three each today. (But I’m compen­
sating for the total fools who don’t even try 
them. Like the fools who never wanted their 
daily Babybels: I used to do the rounds of 
the canteen, collecting desiderata. So more 
like seven.) I feed the chickens the roots of 
seven turnips before going back to the garlic 
columns. A greybeard once told me Farmers 
who wait until they finish their Beverly Gage 
papers never plant. He added, If they watch 
every cloud, they never harvest.
