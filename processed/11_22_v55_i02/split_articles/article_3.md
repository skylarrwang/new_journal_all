Warm Balls, 
Hot Commodity
B
efore school started, before the packs 
of twelve-person first-year friend 
groups started menacing campus, before 
twelve-packs of Bud Light began to litter 
High Street, I met Lisa Satavu. I walked 
into the Loose Leaf on Whitney Avenue 
on a tepid August day, sweating lightly. 
Satavu had her two children in tow, ages 
7 and 2. We sat down at a table, all four 
of us. I sipped a Banana Foster Milk 
nervously, glancing at the small heart
sharpied on the lid.


Satavu and her husband Marcus own 
and operate a vast array of businesses 
in Connecticut. Yale students before 
my time might remember FroyoWorld 
frozen yogurt shops in the spots where 
the Loose Leaf locations on High Street 
and Whitney Avenue currently stand. 
It was Lisa and her brothers that first 
started what is now a successful, New 
England-wide chain of frozen yogurt 
shops. Satavu and her husband also own 
all Saladcraft and Pokémoto locations
in New Haven.


When I asked her how she came to 
own a Loose Leaf, she told me about 
her business philosophies, about eating 
spoonfuls of red bean as a child, about 
working fourteen hours a day when 
starting FroyoWorld, about her family 
and her life.


Satavu had been a teacher before 
she delved into the food industry. “My 
brothers were always the business guys,” 
she said. After ten years of teaching, she 
decided to join her brothers in manag­
ing their FroyoWorlds. But Satavu said 
that Froyoworld, in New Haven at least, 
had run its course by the time the boba 
industry started to gain mainstream trac­
tion in 2019 and 2020.


“With time, things change, just like 
fashion, just like the interests of peo­
ple,” Satavu said. “Granted, everything 
starts first on the West Coast, but at 
least in our sense, we felt like Yale is 
kind of the heart of the East Coast, with 
all the newest attractions and cultural 
foods. So that’s why we wanted to bring
Loose Leaf here.”


So, like students from across the 
country arriving in droves to the East 
Coast, many for the first time, Loose 
Leaf seems to be another wide-eyed 
West Coast transplant, finding its foot­
ing in New Haven, Connecticut. 


I wrapped up my conversation 
with Satavu. I was under the impres­
sion that I was the one interviewing her, 
but after the twenty minutes I spent 
speaking to her, she offered me a job.


A week later, I was a “bobarista.”

n The Book of Tea, published in 1906, 
the aesthete and art critic Okakura 
Kakuzō detailed the birth, history, and 
beauty of making a simple cup of tea. 
Of primary importance to him was the 
rare harmony of Eastern and Western 
cultures in their enjoyment of tea. 
“Humanity has so far met in a tea-cup,” 
he wrote.


“In the liquid amber,” he wrote, 
“within the ivory-porcelain, the initi­
ated may touch the sweet reticence 
of Confucius, the piquancy of Laotse, 
and the ethereal aroma of Sakyamuni 
himself.” Okakura saw tea-making 
as a religion in and of itself, draw­
ing in philosophies from Buddhism
and Daoism.


I wonder what Okakura would think 
of a typical summer afternoon in the 
bustling kitchen of a Loose Leaf Boba 
shop. Drinks sling with the efficiency of 
hospital triage, bobaphiles coming and 
going, still more young people chatting 
around mouthfuls of the “real tea, real 
ingredients, and real milk” that Loose 
Leaf’s website advertises.


Everything takes on a rosy pink 
tinge in the light of the iconic Loose 
Leaf neon signs. “With my besteas,” 
they proclaim. “Don’t teas’ me!” At the 
table next to me, two boys talk about 
their summer consulting internships 
and their upcoming YSIG (Yale Student 
Investment Group) interviews. Everyone 
is drinking boba.


The tapioca balls, introduced to the 
United States in the late nineteen-eight­
ies by Taiwanese immigrants, go by a 
whole host of monikers in both English 
and Mandarin. There’s the “bubble” in 
bubble tea, tapioca pearls, boba, etcetera 
etcetera. I heard a rumor that the word
“波霸” (romanized, literally “bo” and “ba”)
stemmed from Taiwanese slang for 
boobs. I texted my dad the question: 
“Does 波霸 actually mean breasts in 
Taiwanese slang?”


“Actually, big breasts,” he replied. 
So in its very nature, a kind of orig­
inal sin, perhaps boba is deeply unseri­
ous. Squishy, often warm, globular and 
toothsome—on every Loose Leaf cup 
is the same phrase printed in small font: 
“Caution: Little Warm Balls.” While 
Okakura Kakuzo thought that East and 
West might be unified in tea, boba itself, 
in its spherical glory, might be a com­
plete foil to the seriousness of the tea 
ceremony of East Asian traditions.


Originally sequestered in Taiwanese 
American, and then Asian American, 
communities, boba has quickly spread to 
major cities over the past five years, and 
it’s now firmly rooted in New Haven. 
Vivi Bubble Tea on Chapel, a branch of 
the nationwide chain, opened in 2016. 
Whale Tea on Whitney Avenue opened 
in 2019. The two Loose Leaf locations 
opened in 2021 and 2022. Now, seeing 
students toting the characteristic tall, 
clear cup and black boba-compatible 
straw is commonplace.


Many young Asian Americans raised 
on the West Coast, myself included, 
grew up drinking boba, brightly colored 
and distinctly flavored, in chain stores 
like Tea Station and Lollicup. Back then, 
drinking boba was weird. It was a for­
eign drink, and the pearls were a textural 
and geometric shock. Years later, every­
one is drinking boba, from California
to Connecticut.


Loose Leaf, like so many other 
national boba chains, began on the West 
Coast. As the sun was going down on a 
scorching California day, I met Thomas 
Liu and Jasmine Yip, the founders 
of Loose Leaf, at their Los Angeles 
Melrose location. We spoke under a 
faux-fresco mural of The Last Supper 
starring Bernie Sanders, Cardi B, Kurt 
Cobain, Trevor Noah, Oprah Winfrey, 
and Ellen DeGeneres, drinking pale 
beige cups of boba.


Liu grew up in the San Gabriel 
Valley, a predominantly Asian suburb of 
Southern California, just twenty miles 
shy of the city of Los Angeles. “It was 
Asians on top of Asians,” he said. “There 
was a boba shop on every corner.”


The complicated cultural makeup of 
his family, the majority of which moved 
to Vietnam from China after the 1911 
Xinhai Revolution, informs his interest 
in the food industry. It informs the menu 
choices at Loose Leaf, too: offerings 
range from drinks incorporating pandan, 
a green Southeast Asian leaf that tastes 
like vanilla and coconut, to the “POG 
Agua Fresca,” inspired by Mexican road­
side beverage stands. 


But both Yip and Liu never shook 
the idea that boba’s shape, texture, and 
name were something to laugh at. 
Jasmine said that their brand is based on 
the idea that humor, like food, bridges 
wide gaps. Loose Leaf’s voicemail 
directs you to place an online order at 
“warmballs.com.”


“Everything you do, just enjoy your 
life,” Yip said. “Customers who have a 
sense of humor will see you like you’re 
real people.”


I look up at Jesus-Bernie painted 
onto the wall, his arms spread open as if 
proselytizing, and Judas-Oprah grasp­
ing a cup of boba in her traitorous hand. 
Sense of humor, indeed. 


Paul Freedman, a serious, glasses-
wearing man surrounded by shelves of 
colorful books, is a Professor of History 
and a Medievalist specializing in 
Catalonian and cuisine history. Standing 
among the last bastions of non-boba 
drinkers, he believes that consuming cul­
ture, such as media and food, is a mis­
guided way to understand people.


“I don’t think that gastronomy is a 
path toward understanding,” he told me 
when I interviewed him. “People your 
age have been taught a lot of pieties in 
high school . . . ‘Oh, if we just eat a lot of 
Vietnamese food, we’re gonna under­
stand a lot more about Vietnam’ is in that 
category of comforting pieties.” 


I thought back to reading about 
the religious history and ceremonies 
surrounding tea culture in Japan and 
China. I wonder if the way that tea has 
evolved has required an evolution of the 
way we worship it, that drinking boba 
tea requires a repetition of “comforting 
pieties” to be palatable. 


However, many boba shop owners 
that I interviewed espoused the idea 
that boba actually can in fact bridge gaps 
between people and serve as an intro­
duction to Asian culture and foods. Lisa 
Satavu is one of them.
