declarations such as The beach has reached 
capacity, or Non-residents have to pay their 
fair share. These signs and fees serve as 
tangible manifestations of the beach 
town belief that its residents have an 
unquestionable right to their adjacent 
coastlines, while non-residents do not.


Others point to the financial inequity 
that they believe would follow from 
expanded Connecticut public beach 
access. As reported by the Greenwich 
Free Press, Brian Farnen, formerly a 
Connecticut State Representative in 
Fairfield (D-132), insisted on looking at 
the question of beach access from “an 
equity perspective”—that is, financial 
equity. As a reason for limiting beach 
access, he cited a perceived imbalance in 
tax dollars: Fairfield residents sent too 
much to the state capital, he wrote, when 
considering the funds that they received 
back to invest in their local community 
“Our typical resident . . . is paying so 
much money in property taxes to upkeep 
these beaches, [and] yes they should get 
that benefit,” Farnen noted.


State representatives like Lemar 
were quick to remind me that the idea 
that these wealthy coastal communi­
ties were primarily responsible for their 
beach’s upkeep is a fallacy. In reality, the 
Long Island Sound and its beaches are 
kept clean by state and federal govern­
ments. They invest hundreds of millions 
of dollars annually in sewage treatment 
and other wastewater management—
dollars which, ultimately, come from 
Connecticut residents, many of whom 
will be excluded from the beaches they 
help pay for.


“They’re 
not 
charging 
differen­
tial rates because they need help 
upkeeping their beaches,” Rep. Lemar 
insists. “That’s a bold-faced lie. They’re 
charging differential rates to keep
people out.”


New Haven beaches rank low in 
terms of restrictive access to the coast 
along the Long Island Sound. But the 
pandemic, Lemar told me, offered pub­
lic health restriction justification to limit 
beach access, even in previously accessi­
ble locations. This shift spurred Lemar 
to look at beaches through an equity 
lens—and in turn made his concern for 
the future of Connecticut beach accessi­
bility heighten.


“[I soon saw] that what started off as 
capping off beaches from a health and 
safety justification quickly shifted to lin­
gering resident-only regulations,” Lemar 
recalled, thinking back on summers in 
the state once COVID-19 cases had begun 
to decline. “I saw this right here in East 
Haven, which shut down access to the 
beach and went out of their way to ticket 
and tow non-locals, like my constituents 
in New Haven. The refusal to relax those 
rules after public guidance had relaxed, 
along with the continued expansion of 
these differential rate structures, points 
“THE BEST WAY TO 
MAKE A BEACH PUBLIC 
IS TO GET THE PUBLIC 
ONTO IT,” PRICE SAID.
“YOU HAVE TO LEARN 
WHICH SIGNS YOU CAN 
SMILE AT AND WHICH 
YOU CAN IGNORE.”
to an underlying racial prejudice in the 
state and a [hoarding] of the very things 
all those in Connecticut should have the 
right to access.”


The myth of local beach upkeep 
functions in the interest of municipalities, 
who then monopolize these shorelines at 
the cost of widespread public access. 
“But all waters run to Long Island 
Sound: whether they like it or not, the 
whole state is involved,” Connecticut 
State Representative Michael Winkler 
of Vernon, Connecticut (D-56) echoed.


My mother grew up a block away from 
the infamously-bustling and border­
line-mythical Venice Beach boardwalk: 
an ecosystem defined by screenwriters 
with a dream, skaters with a cause, and 
NIMBY-homeowners with a fight to pick. 
My grandparents still live in a centu­
ry-old Californian apartment building 
in sight of the water. It’s the beachside 
heartbeat of our family.


About twenty miles west of the Rose 
Avenue Beach Tower in Venice stretches 
the long-fraught Malibu coastline, in 
which public access to the beach has 
come at an unearthly price. With the 
city’s founding came the violent des­
ecration of sacred Chumash land, as 
present-day Malibu stood as the south­
ern capital of the 200-mile spanning 
Chumash territory. Since its unlikely 
inception as the “Malibu Movie Colony” 
by the railroad-rich Rindge couple in

the 1930s, Malibu persists as the post­
er-child for private property and public 
trust disputes in the state. Just as Rhoda 
May Knight Rindge—the “Queen of 
Malibu”—once unsuccessfully attempted 
to block the construction of the Pacific 
Coast Highway through the Malibu Pier 
in order to tuck Malibu away from wide­
spread public access, Malibu’s billionaire 
elite have been closing off their beach 
fronts for decades. They’ve used pub­
lic intimidation tactics to scare off visi­
tors, along with clout and capital to try
to justify their exclusive right to the sea.


“There’s a sense in L.A. that if you’re 
rich you have earned the right to be 
insulated, to not have to live next to 
public lands,” formerly L.A.-based envi­
ronmental organizer and public artist 
Jenny Price GRD ’98 said to me. “What 
that means is that many people can’t get 
to the beach that they can see out their 
window.”


I wanted to better understand how 
the idea of access and upkeep are at play 
by the Pacific, so I spoke via Whatsapp 
with 
environmental 
historian 
and 
Southern Californian beach scholar Elsa 
Devienne. A Parisian native who for a 
decade has dedicated her research to the 
study of Southern Californian beach cul­
ture and climate, she called me while on 
holiday back home in the French coun­
tryside. She managed to both poke fun at 
our spotty telephone signal and solemnly 
discuss climate scientists’ predictions 
that sea level rise in the West Coast will 
reach 8 inches by 2050, leaving all but 
the largest Malibu beaches, like Zuma, 
swept below flood levels. 


“Beaches are what climate engineers 
call ‘rivers of sand,’” Devienne noted. 
“L.A. beaches were artificially enlarged in 
the seventies with generated sediment in 
order to meet rising demands to create 
modern beaches for a modern city. And 
due to a combination of both climate 
change and standard beach deterioration, 
they’re rapidly eroding.”


It’s a stunning and disconcertingly 
equalizing omen: even these coveted, 
star-studded beaches are not built to 
last. And still, fights for equitable pub­
lic beach access along Broad Beach and 
other famed Malibu beach fronts persist 
along this degenerating coastline. 
Malibu 
property 
owners 
have 
pushed back against expanding pub­
lic beach access since the beachtown’s 
unlikely inception in the early twenti­
eth century. Notably, American billion­
aire and entertainment industry mogul 
David Geffen made headlines in 1983 
when purchasing his beach mansion, 
which conjoined two existing prop­
erties and blocked a state-mandated 
sidewalk-to-shore public pathway. He 
made the news again in 2002 after refus­
ing to make public easements or beach 
access points on his Carbon “Billionaire’s” 
Beach Malibu home. Yet, in 2007, after 
substantial pushback, he agreed to open 
Sunrise at Malibu Lagoon, 2020.

up a 42-foot stretch of the prized Carbon 
Beach to the public in exchange for a 
10-foot privacy go-between. Despite this 
seemingly small-scale victory, Geffen’s 
concession marked a historic and prece­
dent-setting win for the state.


“The best way to make a beach pub­
lic is to get the public onto it,” Price said. 
“You have to learn which signs you can 
smile at and which you can ignore.” 


California is the only state to enforce 
public beach access thanks to the regu­
latory powers of the California Coastal 
Commission, an organization created by 
the state’s voters in 1972 amidst a rise of 
coastal and environmental activism in 
the 1960s and 1970s.


In early August, Linda Locklin 
called me from her turquoise blue, 
knick-knack filled office space in Santa 
Cruz, California. She speaks with a 
warm, instinctive grin. Locklin lets me 
know that she’s been the Coastal Access 
Program Manager for the commission 
for over three decades. She dreamed of 
marrying her interests in environmen­
tal planning and fieldwork with public 
benefit, and she feels she has achieved 
just that. She fearlessly loves this agency, 
what it stands for and what it defends.


Locklin speaks proudly of the criti­
cal victories the commission has secured. 
Through their issuing of permits for 
development across 1.5 million acres of 
state coastal lands, over the last thirty 
to forty years, the California Coastal 
Commission has been able to successfully 
obtain public walkways between houses 
on private property and public lands, 
despite private homeowners’ perpetual 
resistance to state regulations. She notes 
that widespread present-day access to 
Malibu beach fronts stands as an exam­
ple of how the public right to beach space
can win out against the muscle of capital.


“People have always known they’re 
welcome in vast public beaches like 
Zuma or Surfrider, but it takes gump­
tion to walk down recently-opened pub­
lic pathways to smaller beach fronts . . .” 
Locklin reflects. “They make you feel like 
you’re not wanted even though you have 
every legal right to be there.”


Now the Coastal Commission has 
the power to levy fines against public 
access violators, such as resistant coastal 
homeowners. They often go to court and, 
Locklin boasts, they have yet to lose.


In notes directed at the Connecticut 
state legislature opposing Rep. Lemar’s 
coastal equity bill, state residents from 
historically restrictive coastal suburbs 
like Fairfield and Greenwich said things 
ranging from:
 “As municipalities have seen over 
the years, Hartford creates an issue where 
there is not one and then passes the 
buck” to “I hope that you will reconsider,
otherwise you will be ruining our town!”


Other opponents believe beaches are 
a scarce resource that must be limited in 
order to avoid overwhelming capacity 
numbers.


Connecticut 
State 
Rep. 
Steve 
Meskers (D-150) of Greenwich explained 
that the popular beach destination, 
Greenwich Point, contained 1,100 park­
ing spaces, while the town consists of 
60,000 residents. He voiced that capac­
ity was nearly oversaturated as is, par­
ticularly on summer holiday, and there 
was no obvious area for additional beach 
parking or practical train transit.


“I’m not sure how I grant more 
incremental access,” Meskers told the 
Greenwich Free Press.


He further outlined that no state 
bills considered the over-extension of 
public access to non-state residents; 
shorelines like Greenwich touch the 
New York border, and are a common 
destination for residents of both states.


“I’m concerned I’m being asked for 
reciprocity to residents of another state,” 
Meskers suggested.


At the beginning of the century, 
many state beach activists hoped the 
issue of undue beach restrictions had 
been settled. Although the Connecticut 
Supreme Court ruling in Leydon 
v. Greenwich in 2001 affirmed the 
right of non-residents’ use of munici­
pal beaches, beach restrictions still run 
rampant. As a result of the Leydon 
ruling, non-residents are now legally 
allowed onto municipal beaches, but 
due to an onslaught of town-ordered
