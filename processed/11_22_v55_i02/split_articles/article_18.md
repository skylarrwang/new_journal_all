Another part of our 
mission is to deliver 
our Lord’s message 
of life over abortion 
to the most needy 
and vulnerable 
communities. We do 
not wait for these 
women in need to 
come to us; we go 
to them. In Our 
Blessed Mother’s 
Arms actively 
reaches out to these 
women through our 
grassroots outreach 
program and takes 
God’s message of
love and assistance
directly to them.
Ivana Solsbery’s got blue-green eyes, long 
blond hair, and she’s light on her feet.
From the iobma 
mission statement.


Solsbery said it comprises most of her work, and 
that it’s “what’s different between our center and 
a lot of them”:
Another part of our mission is to deliver our 
Lord’s message of life over abortion to the most needy 
and vulnerable communities. We do not wait for 
these women in need to come to us; we go to them. 
In Our Blessed Mother’s Arms actively reaches out 
to these women through our grassroots outreach pro­
gram and takes God’s message of love and assistance
In practice, we go to them is pretty literal: 
Solsbery drives directly to the doorsteps of her 
clients in New Haven, Waterbury, Meriden, 
Hamden—“all over here.” While recruitment 
happens outside Planned Parenthood, Solsbery’s 
grassroots outreach happens from behind the wheel, 
with a trunk full of diapers, food, and other sup­
plies. The clients she hasn’t already met on the 
sidewalk by Planned Parenthood usually hear 
about IOBMA through the recommendation of 
past clients. They often call without coming in 
person to IOBMA. This way, she said, her clients 
don’t have to pay for bus tickets or gas. Most of 
her descriptions of trips to help clients involve 
delivery of basic provisions for infants.
“I’ve been out at 10 o’clock delivering for­
mula,” said Solsbery. “The baby had diarrhea and 
went through the diapers, I came and delivered
them to ‘em.”
Solsbery seems proud of her work with 
New Haven’s refugee and immigrant communi­
ties. She mentioned a couple from Afghanistan, 
another from Iraq. She spoke about a girl from 
China, pointing to a photo of a family in a din­
ing room on the wall of her office. “This little girl 
was almost aborted, but—and they’re very intel­
ligent people—they were scared,” she said. “In 
their country at that time they could only have 
one child.” (New Haven’s resettlement agency, 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services (IRIS), 
doesn’t send its clients to crisis pregnancy centers 
in New Haven, according to Nika Zarazvand, a 
Health Coordinator at IRIS. Solsbery said she 
mostly meets these clients on the sidewalk out­
side Planned Parenthood.)
Solsbery switched IOBMA’s label from a preg­
nancy resource center to a family center four 
years ago, and maintains that it’s still a 501(c)(3) 
nonprofit organization. The change was made to 
reflect the center’s expansion from strictly moth­
erhood-related services to food, housing, and 
beyond—as well as the aim of the organization to 
“unite families,” Solsbery said, and to “involve the 
whole family”with pregnancies.
“I’ve had dads cry on my shoulder because 
they didn’t want to have this abortion, but he had 
no choice in the matter,” Solsbery said. “He’s the 
father and our laws haven’t even caught up with 
that, and I feel so bad . . . He wants to do what’s 
right and he can’t.”
In veering away from the medical front of 
other crisis pregnancy centers, IOBMA perhaps 
becomes more appealing. Not only does it appear 
professionally homey, it promises a personal 
and long-term relationship with clients, with an
all-in-one owner-recruiter-counselor-financer 
point-person who guides patients by the hand, 
each step of the way. By contrast, Connecticut’s 
only state-level abortion fund, the Reproductive 
Equity Access Choice (REACH) Fund, provides a 
markedly impersonal service in order to protect 
patients’ privacy and decision-making processes. 
For Jessica Puk, Board President and Co-Founder 
of REACH, “it’s enough just knowing that we 
helped people get their healthcare.”
A long-haul, one-on-one, one-stop-shop—
IOBMA makes a bigger promise. And perhaps the 
biggest part of that promise: it’s free. Solsbery said 
she funds the many services of IOBMA through 
individual donations, and events like church 
drives, baby bottle drives, a biannual fundraiser 
by a young women’s group at Branford High 
School, and an oyster festival in Milford where 
she planned to sell some snow cones. “I’m always 
doing some kind of fundraiser,” she said.
She said she’s also constantly applying for 
and requesting grants from local ministries, such 
as the Archdiocese of Hartford, and wherever 
else she can find funding. IOBMA’s Form 990—its 
income tax form, obtained online—from 2014 
was the only publicly available record of IOBMA 
spending that I could find. It shows that the cen­
ter received just under $11,000 that year in “con­
tributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts,” 
which made up all its income. The largest listed 
expense was the “provision of diapers, lotion, for­
mula creams and necessities for mother & babies,” 
amounting to almost $2,300, followed by “cloth­
ing, bedding, high chairs, car seats for babies as 
needed,” at around $1,000, then “printing, publi­
cations, postage, and shipping” at $950, and “sup­
plemented food for families of clients as needed” 
at about $700. No rent is listed as an expense.
It’s about the family unit, not a medical prac­
tice; Solsbery claims clients’ decisions to seek 
abortions is respected and discussed, rather than 
totally rejected; it’s a local, home-grown organi­
zation funded by Solsbery pulling herself up by 
her bootstraps and finding funds in her com­
munity, not some direct overhead fund, and it 
doesn’t invoke the name recognition of a major 
crisis pregnancy center network like Birthright,

which has seven locations across Connecticut 
and at least hundreds nationally. In Our Blessed 
Mother’s Arms, maybe, isn’t like the typical crisis 
pregnancy center.
Or maybe it is. What’s atypical about IOBMA 
makes it somewhat standard: crisis pregnancy 
centers all around Connecticut and the coun­
try have their own individual identities, formed 
through variations in geography, resource offer­
ings, homeyness, professionalism, basis in faith, 
and commitment to long-term relationships with 
clients. Connecticut’s crisis pregnancy centers 
deploy via mobile van, juxtaposition with abortion 
clinics, and nestle in some of the state’s lowest-
income regions like Bridgeport, Waterbury, and 
Cheshire; they offer different combinations of 
pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, couples’ counsel­
ling, information about abortion and adoption, 
and parenting counselling, among other offerings. 
IOBMA has filed its tax returns under the family 
services category, not reproductive health care, 
but other crisis pregnancy centers in the state file 
under alternative categories too, like human ser­
vices, women’s services, religion, and maternal and 
prenatal health.
IOBMA’s also a former affiliate of Heartbeat 
International, one of the nation’s largest cri­
sis pregnancy networks, according to Solsbery 
and a certificate in her center that indicated the 
affiliation expired in 2016. Solsbery’s working 
to get funding for an ultrasound machine from 
the Knights of Columbus, the world’s largest 
Catholic fraternal service, whose global head­
quarters is located in New Haven. The organiza­
tion will hopefully match the funds she raises for 
the machine through their designated program 
for purchasing ultrasounds for crisis pregnancy 
centers. Solsbery saidshe hopes to find a doctor 
who will operate the machine.

In Tiny You: A Western History of the Anti-Abortion 
Movement, Jennifer Holland—an author and 
University of Oklahoma professor of history 
specializing in abortion history—traces the early 
modern anti-abortion movement with a focus on 
the American West, where many of the country’s 
first crisis pregnancy centers sprang up in the six­
ties. It’s also where Solsbery—born in San Diego 
and later spending time in Colorado—said she 
spent her life before moving to New Haven at the 
turn of the century. 
Back then, according to Holland, most crisis 
pregnancy centers were led by either evangel­
ical Christians or Catholics—with evangelical 
Christians believing in proselytizing the immo­
rality of abortion to clients, and Catholics focus­
ing on prayer without preaching. And within 
these denominations, staff were historically 
mostly white women. Unlike men, women could 
uniquely convey “that it was their experience 
as women that led them to their anti-abortion 
stance, not partisan politics,” Holland writes. 
The position and status of white women gave 
them “the experiential authority to speak to other 
women and the moral authority to intervene in 
intimate familial issues.” Beyond professional­
ism and medical posture, many centers sough to 
create a “kitchen table feeling” while interact­
ing with clients to personalize the experience as
much as possible.
Solsbery carries on these founding traditions, 
including the old Catholic approach—recruiting 
with prayer because “that’s our way of helping,” 
but she doesn’t expect her clients to share her reli­
gious views.
IOBMA also contains many of the shifting 
strategies of crisis pregnancy centers—especially 
the focus on the fetus, a notorious and founda­
tional tenet of the modern anti-abortion move­
ment used to convey that fetuses constitute 
human life and that abortion is murder. In IOBMA, 
there’s fetal development chart lining the wall 
in her center’s bathroom, there’s a seven-minute 
video on DVD showing fetal development in the 
womb, and there are fetal dolls that she tucks into 
the palms of potential clients on the sidewalk 
(“for when we don’t have time” to explain, she 
said), and Solsbery herself resists language refer­
ring to the fetus.
“The child in the womb,” explained Solsbery, 
“is a child. It’s not a fetus. It’s not a baby.”
In the late seventies, according to Holland, 
people running crisis pregnancy centers realized 
that the kitchen table strategy was not enough 
because they were largely serving low-income 
women, young women, and women of color 
who faced practical challenges that moral guid­
ance couldn’t answer. They increasingly began 
offering family support services to supplement 
their messaging. Today, IOBMA, as a family
