water–in the most flood-vulnerable cor­
ners of New Haven. Since 2014, Ozyck 
and his crew have installed almost four 
hundred of them across the city.
On a Friday afternoon in October, 
he and I visited the very first bioswale in 
New Haven, just outside the Berzelius 
secret society on Trumbull Street. The 
rain from the night before collected in 
tiny puddles by the curbside. The lower 
leaves of the bioswale’s inkberries and 
daylilies glistened with water droplets. 
The soil in the swale felt cool and damp 
to touch, a sign that the plants in the 
bioswale had been busy filtering away 
neighborhoods like Fair Haven have 
already started eroding. “What used to 
be a fifty-year storm is now a ten-year 
storm,” said Ozyck. In other words, a 
storm with a severity seen only once every 
fifty years is now occurring in every ten.
On Front Street, he showed me homes 
facing the Quinnipiac River with par­
tial-underground basements that—like 
Lyric Hall—have experienced a signifi­
cant uptick in flooding. From the end of 
Clifton Street, we saw a building partially 
sinking into the river. The guardrail of 
the outlook we stood on was just inches 
away from touching the water itself. 
Rising sea levels, Ozyck said, has only 
increased the odds of flooding. Water 
from the riverbanks will naturally spill 
onto the streets during an intense rain 
event, stressing the already aged parts of 
the city’s sewage system and threatening 
to make overflows of Westville’s kind 
dramatically more frequent.
Part of preventing these sewage 
outpourings will therefore require pro­­
tecting the city from floods. Single sewer 
pipes like those in Westville are begin­
ning to overflow with greater regularity 
as ever-intensifying flood events strain 
their capacity. Less flooding, then, would 
mean less overflow. After Hurricane 
Sandy and Irene hit in 2011, the engi­
neering department received grants 
from the state and federal government 
for future flood protection. One of them, 
the Community Development Block 
Grant, awarded $4 million to studying 
green infrastructure development in the 
Long Wharf area. The research, which 


the runoff. The idea was to return rain­
water back into the soil, where it would 
be taken up by street trees and absorbed 
into the water table.
“It’s mimicking what nature wants 
to happen with water, which is that it 
should go through soils and down and 
recharge the subsurface water light table,” 
Murphy-Dunning said. In the process, 
the soil ends up cleaning the water in 
ways that traditional treatment plants do 
not. The bioswale’s success on Trumbull 
exceeded their initial expectations: by 
naturally filtering the run-off, it man­
aged to save a street that had long suf­
fered from chronic flooding.


C
limate change has only intensified 
these sewage overflow events. “The 
more we experience sea level rise and 
just . . . higher and higher levels in the 
harbor, the more that reduces the capac­
ity of our storm system and . . . the more 
we see that flooding,” said Henning.
Global warming’s effects are begin­
ning to be felt in a city that sits right 
along the water’s edge. “There were 
a series of storms that happened [in] 
2010 through 2015, in addition to hurri­
canes Sandy and Irene, that were really 
intense [and] had high return frequen­
cies,” said Henning. During that time, 
ten- and twenty-five-year storms swept 
through the city almost yearly. That 
hasn’t improved: storms that are statisti­
cally only suppposed to occur once every 
five to ten years are hitting New Haven 
annually, explained Henning.
Streets like Quinnipiac Avenue and 

Henning was responsible for, explored 
potential green solutions.
Long Wharf, which is directly beside 
the Long Island Sound, is currently one 
of the areas most vulnerable to flooding. 
The first phase of their proposed FEMA-
grant project will expand Long Wharf’s 
current drainage capacity by construct­
ing a 10-foot diameter pipe from the 
police station out to the harbor. Another 
project, led by the Army Corps of 
Engineers, has plans to build a flood wall 
along the sea-facing I-95 and install a 
pump station. In plans to protect the city 
from sea level rise roughly half a meter 
higher than the national average by 2050. 
Combined, the total costs work out to
roughly $195.8 million.
The completion dates of both proj­
ects remain uncertain. The tunnel pro­
posal is currently under review, which 
Henning admitted “can take a while.” 
After the agreement, she expects another 
six months for permitting and two years 
of construction. The flood wall awaits two 
years of design and a three- to four-year
construction period.
Bioswales, meanwhile, have pro­
vided a faster—and possibly more 
efficient—short-term solution for the 
city. “Green infrastructure is much less 
disruptive to install,” Murphy-Dunning 
said. One of the greatest challenges to 
updating the single-sewer system is its 
cost and labor: adding another pipe calls 
for digging up the entire road, creating 
a trench, and connecting the newly-laid 
pipe to every curbside catch-basin. By 
collecting runoff on the streets, bioswales 
help ease the strain on the existing single-
pipe sewage system.
Murphy recognized the importance 
of the city’s current ­flood-protection 
projects, but she also brought up the 
importance of managing its existing 
impervious surfaces. Man-made mate­
rials, such as asphalt, increase the odds 
of flooding by preventing runoff from 
entering the ground. And while larger 
drainage pipes will certainly help, the 
flooding will only return if the city con­
tinues to develop over existing green 
spaces at the rate it currently is.
Henning tells me that the city 
itself has no jurisdiction over combined 
sewage. The engineering department 
only oversees storm drainage; the san­
itary system is managed instead by the 


greater New Haven Water Pollution 
Control 
Authority, 
a 
quasi-private 
entity that has its own long-term con­
trol plans. However, Henning did note 
that “they are under consent order by the 
[Environmental Protection Agency] to 
manage the two-year six-hour storm and 
to have essentially no overflows.”
As it waits for approval on its land­
mark projects, the city has continued to 
take steps towards flood resilience. Some 
of its smaller projects include replacing 
hundred-year-old clay pipes and clean­
ing curbside catch-basins.
With grant funding used up, bio-
swale construction has stopped. Its 
maintenance remains in the hands of 

Cavaliere and his fellow 
Westville residents have 
watched these sewage 
overflows increase in 
frequency against a trend 
of rising sea levels and 
intensifying storms.


Getting the resources and making sure 
there is enough to go around will take 
time. Making sure every neighborhood 
receives the funding they need, how­
ever, is easier said than done. “We get 
this investment for downtown, but how 
does it appear in some other part of the 
city . . . ? It’s tough,” she said.


O
n September 6th, 2022, New Haven 
received 4 inches of rain in six 
hours—a month’s worth of precipitation 
packed into the span of a day. Rainwater 
streamed down streets, bogging cars 
and school buses. At Yale, Bass Library 
flooded; Benjamin Franklin’s dining 
halls seeped water; and the floor of base­
ment butteries grew slick.
That day, in the basement of Lyric 
Hall, Cavaliere recorded 9 inches.
As a densifying urban area, New 
Haven faces a unique set of challenges. 
The city has to contend with runoff along 
concrete surfaces and rising sea levels, 
bearing the brunt of both inland and 
coastal flooding. “We’re kind of getting 
it from all angles,” said Henning.
Back at Lyric Hall, it is mid-October 
and not quite yet the tail of fall. Sunlight 
URI. During our meeting Ozyck pulled 
his truck over to the side of Grove Street, 
walked out, and tugged out a mat of 
browning red oak leaves from the bot­
tom. Bioswales have to be constantly 
monitored and maintained to function 
properly, he said. Repairing broken 
guardrails, granite edging, and remov­
ing yard-waste is a months-long project
for the nonprofit.
“I think we try to work on all 
scales,” Henning said. She looks for­
ward to running studies using a geo­
graphic imaging system that will help 
the city capture more data. For areas 
like Westville’s Whalley Avenue and 
Forest Road, she noted that “we’re kind 
of in the study phase of the flooding.” 

And while larger drainage 
pipes will certainly help, the 
flooding will only return if 
the city continues to develop
over existing green spaces at 
the rate it currently is.
sifts past the balcony, through the win­
dows, onto the refurbished Persian car­
pet at the shop’s entrance, like any other 
day. The only traces of last month’s flood 
might be the basement’s faint mustiness 
as Cavaliere shows me the ball valve he 
installed. Closing it would shut the pipe 
that leads to the street sewer main and 
keep sewage from backing up into the 
toilet. Now, he explained, the plan is 
to apply for grant funding that would 
lift his storefront an additional two feet 
and waterproof the building’s warped 
foundations.
The back of the house is paint-
peeled and sagging. Recently, though, a 
friend had helped repair the side of the 
basement. Cavaliere looked out at the 
pool of golden leaves across the street. 
Despite all the challenges he has expe­
rienced, he’s still hopeful: “It’s a miracle 
that I’ve managed to survive all this but 
I think it’s because I just feel so loved by 
the community and I love my commu­
nity, and I am doing exactly what I want 
to do in my life.” ∎
