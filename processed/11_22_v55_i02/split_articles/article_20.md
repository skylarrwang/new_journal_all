the nation’s leading organization of reproduc­
tive health clinicians. The Abortion Pill Rescue 
Network and Option Line are both programs of 
Heartbeat International, one of the largest crisis 
pregnancy center networks in the country.

The new recruitment strategy is show­
ing results already. She’s barely tried out the 
new methodology, but more people, she said, 
are stopping on the sidewalk than she’s seen
in a long time.


6. No Harm, No Foul
Crisis pregnancy centers have strong free speech 
protections. Laura Portuondo—a Fellow with 
the Program for the Study of Reproductive 
Justice at Yale Law School and an advisor for the 
Law School’s Reproductive Rights and Justice 
Project—explains it this way: the Supreme 
Court has “essentially tied itself into knots” to 
protect crisis pregnancy free speech. These pro­
tections were bolstered back in 2018, when the 
Court heard National Institute of Family and Life 
Advocates (nifla) v. Becerra—a lawsuit filed by 
one of the nation’s largest crisis pregnancy cen­
ter networks—in response to a law passed in 
California requiring crisis pregnancy centers to 
post information about state-offered abortion 
and contraception services, along with a notice 
that they are medically unlicensed. NIFLA argued 
that the government violated their right to free 
speech. The Supreme Court agreed, striking 
down the law in a 5–4 decision. Before the time 
of nifla v. Becerra, crisis pregnancy center speech 
was more so regarded by the Court as the com­
mercial speech of an operational business. Now,

the Court regards it as “traditional speech, like 
you or me,” said Portuondo. And this speech is
much harder to regulate.

Still, Connecticut has attempted to regulate 
it, following in California’s footsteps. In 2021, 
Connecticut passed a bill targeting deceptive 
advertising and created an avenue for reporting 
it through the Attorney General, who can then 
determine if it’s deceptive and open a court order 
to have it taken down. Deceptive advertising, as 
the bill puts it, constitutes “any statement con­
cerning any pregnancy-related service or the 
provision of any pregnancy-related service that is 
deceptive, whether by statement or omission, and 
that a limited services pregnancy center knows or 
reasonably should know to be deceptive.” The bill 
has limited some online advertising, according to 
State Representative Jillian Gilchrest (D-West 
Hartford), a co-sponsor of the bill, and other­
wise cracking down has been a game of “cat and 
mouse.” And there’s still the caveat that “there 
can be crisis pregnancy centers who might be 
misinforming individuals who actually enter their 
physical space or who have misinformation in the 
physical space.” 

Connecticut’s advertising bill is being chal­
lenged by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), 
the same organization that defended NIFLA in 
the California case, and that helped draft and 
defend the Mississippi legislation that led to 
the toppling of Roe v. Wade. ADF filed a federal 
lawsuit against Attorney General William Tong, 
on behalf of the Care Net Pregnancy Resource 
Center of Southeastern Connecticut using a 
similar interpretation of the First Amendment
to the California case.

Liz Gustafson is the State Director of Pro-
Choice Connecticut, a non-profit that works 
to protect and expand reproductive freedom in 
Connecticut, and that collaborates with simi­
lar organizations across the country to engage 
nationally with its mission. She’s also a former 
escort for Hartford GYN, an abortion clinic that 
used to share a parking lot with a crisis pregnancy 
center. Liz Gustafson said that the legal backing 
of crisis pregnancy centers crystallizes their criti­
cal role in the anti-abortion movement.

“[Crisis pregnancy centers] fundamentally 
operate as the frontline for the anti-abortion 
movement, so while they may be operating in 
some kind of different way, all of them move right 
into the same courtyard,” said Gustafson. And if 
crisis pregnancy centers weren’t the frontline, she 
asked, “then why is the legal arm of the anti-abor­
tion 
movement 
challenging 
our 
Attorney
General legally?”

Crisis pregnancy centers seem to exist at a 
remove from legal and political realms of the 
anti-abortion movement, despite serving it, in 
part because they have largely been unbounded 
by legal responsibility for communicating accu­
rately to clients, in part because appearing non­
partisan helps them recruit clients. These factors 
combined have helped crisis pregnancy centers 
work to change minds and hearts about abortion 
in as personal a means as possible. 

For Dina Montemarano—who studies dis­
information in the anti-abortion movement as 
the Research Director for NARAL Pro-Choice 
America, a large nonprofit national organization 
that leads lobbying, political action, and advo­
cacy efforts to protect reproductive freedom—of 
all the ways that the anti-abortion movement 
spreads disinformation, crisis pregnancy centers 
might be the most severe: “meeting people face to 
face at a time when they desperately need some­
one who they can trust, who can give them cor­
rect information—in some way that’s the cruelest 
way that [the anti-abortion movement] is spread­
ing that disinformation,” she said.

Crisis pregnancy centers have honed and 
shifted tactics over time to persuade preg­
nant women to carry their pregnancies to term. 
Meanwhile, legal challenges to abortion have 
shifted strategy in the context of what can be 
argued as constitutional. IOBMA has narrowed in 
on family services that address real, important 
needs of families—but that is an approach cri­
sis pregnancy centers have used for decades to 
target low-income women and women of color. 
IOBMA’s family focus, and its lack of abortion ser­
vice advertising, make it seem relatively mild in 
a sea of crisis pregnancy centers that present as 
Planned Parenthood-like medical clinics. In the 
eyes of the law, it’s pretty clean. But that doesn’t 
change that, while its operation provides real and 
necessary services in the process of delivering our 
Lord’s message of life over abortion to the most needy 
and vulnerable communities, it’s part of the center’s 
particular mechanism of a broad mission to end 
abortion. This means that IOBMA might be quite 
helpful for pregnant clients who know they’d 
like to carry their pregnancies to term, especially 
because IOBMA’s services are free. But for clients 
who might otherwise have decided to have an 
abortion, IOBMA could be dissuasive. And now, 
by recently gaining an ultrasound machine and 
deprioritizing prayer on the sidewalk, IOBMA is 
partially sacrificing its non-medical appearance in 
favor of approachability, potentially to the effect 
of dissuading those clients who might have other­
wise sought out medical expertise and an abortion.

Liz Gustafson recognizes the value of the 
services of crisis pregnancy centers in spite of 
their stances on abortion. “The provision of free 
resources is important, right? Because obviously 
there is a gap in terms of people being able to 
acquire the resources that they need, like free 
diapers,” said Gustafson. “That doesn’t negate 
the fact that they are still a component of the 
anti-abortion movement. I think, if anything, 
that should be an opportunity for our local and 
state government to fill in that gap. Of course, 
we don’t want these organizations who are 
perpetuating dangerous misinformation and 
also just stigma and shame and just terrible, 

“meeting people
face to face at a time 
when they desperately 
need someone who 
they can trust, who 
can give them correct 
information—in some
way that’s the cruelest
way that [the anti-
abortion movement] 
is spreading that dis-
information,” she said.

inaccurate information, but also we need to make 
sure that people who need free resources are able
to get those resources.”

Solsbery works hard to fund, deliver, organize, 
and execute her services. At Thanksgiving, she 
drove approximately forty turkey dinners to fami­
lies in and around New Haven. “They were people 
in need,” she said. “And that’s what I’d hope that 
Planned Parenthood would realize someday: that 
if they’re for choice and the woman that chooses 
life, how come they don’t help her?”

New Haven’s Planned Parenthood doesn’t 
deliver turkey dinners, but, in addition to offering 
abortion and abortion referrals, it offers adoption 
services, adoption referrals, fertility awareness 
education, pregnancy options education, preg­
nancy planning services, birth control, emergency 
contraception, pregnancy testing, and trained 
staff to talk with patients who’ve experienced 
early pregnancy loss, or miscarriages. 

These cost of these services is low, if not free, 
through Medicaid, and other health insurance 
programs, and Planned Parenthood’s subsidiza­
tion programs. Connecticut also offers, as a part of 
its Medicaid public health coverage, Health Care 
for Uninsured Kids and Youth (HUSKY) Health. 
The program subsidizes health services either at 
low cost or for free—depending on income—for 
children, parents, relative caregivers, and pregnant 
people, among others. Undocumented immi­
grants are eligible for HUSKY coverage for prenatal 
care; children up to age nineteen qualify regard­
less of family income. There’s also the REACH 
Fund, Connecticut’s first state-level abortion fund, 
which started partially funding abortions this 
fall using a $50,000-and-growing fund. There’s 
other nonprofits that help with basic childrearing 
necessities, too—like Connecticut Diaper Bank, 
which delivers 300,000 diapers to 6,400 families 
in the state each month.

IOBMA is far from the only alternative to get­
ting an abortion at Planned Parenthood. While 
IOBMA has the guarantee of free services, it’s up 
against some robust competition and affordable 
avenues to obtain them—many of which are 
bound by privacy laws and rigorous standards of 
professional qualifications. 

Despite Connecticut’s resources, however, 
US Census Bureau Data consistently shows 
that Connecticut is a state with extreme wealth 
disparity. And there will always be those who 
don’t have insurance, or who don’t know all the 
options available, or times when government 
support isn’t enough. And perhaps IOBMA will be
there for them.

Solsbery’s concerned with the truth, and 
the women she says are being deprived of it. “It 
should just be about being truthful with each 
individual,” she said. “They have the choice in the 
end—not me, not you. Whoever’s in this situa­
tion, they have the choice in the end, but if they 
know all of their choices—there’s many out there, 
really—then that still becomes free will. God 
gives us free will, so that becomes that person’s 
free will. But if they’re not told the whole truth, no,
that’s not right.” 

The anti-abortion movement has evolved into 
an amalgamated giant over the last fifty years, and 
through it truth has remained a moral fact bol­
stered by false information. Reflecting this cen­
tral truth of the anti-abortion movement—that 
abortion is wrong—through the prismatic lens of 
In Our Blessed Mother’s Arms’ many helpful ser­
vices, that helpfulness seems more sinister. 

IOBMA comprises one woman working with 
one pregnant client at a time, in a state with some 
of the strongest guarantees of abortion rights, in a 
city with services supporting access to reproduc­
tive care. Solsbery has helped at least one client 
fund an abortion, and she’s not interested in pros­
elytizing. It seems harmless. But IOBMA doesn’t 
exist in a solitary vacuum: it builds on the wis­
dom and resources of generations of crisis preg­
nancy centers created to persuade clients to carry 
pregnancies to term. The delicate, hodgepodge, 
homemade quality of IOBMA reflects a power­
ful lifeblood of the anti-abortion movement: 
white women with a cause and the maternal 
approachability to persuade. The mission, after all,
is to end abortion.


7. For the Road
Back at Planned Parenthood, Ivana Solsbery is 
doing her sidewalk circle duties. It’s September, 
and the wind’s got a bite. There’s talks in the 
group of getting an abortion pill reversal sign 
soon, but for now recruitment is still happen­
ing the old way—the spotlight’s on prayer, signs,
and the rosary.

Mid-prayer, the wind knocks over a sign. A 
few minutes later, someone riding a bike knocks 
over another, mumbling something. Both times, 
the signs are immediately put back, with a similar 
urgency to the literature distribution jogging.

“There you go. That’s the other side,” said 
Solsbery, with a sigh, to no one in particular.

 Election season’s on the horizon, too, and 
one of the prayer attendees is wearing a Leora 
Levy cap. On the car next to her, there’s a Leora 
Levy sticker. In the trunk, there’s a Leora Levy 
lawn sign. In November, Leora Levy—the Con­
necticut Republican Senate candidate endorsed 
by Trump—lost the Senate race. 

At one point, Solsbery’s attention turns to the 
Planned Parenthood escorts in pink traffic vests 
in the middle of the parking lot. She’s flabber­
gasted. “Why would anyone volunteer to do that?” 
she asked. ∎
