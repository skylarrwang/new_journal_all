EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Having spoken to former and current mem­
bers, that sense of deception is certainly there, but 
it’s hard to define. People are baptized almost 
immediately, but not all of them later regret 
it. Members learn about Ahn Sahng-hong and 
Zahng Gil-jah at different stages. And although 
the Church’s members are responsible for bring­
ing people in, no individual member is at fault for 
the way the Church eventually strips its members 
dry of their money, time, and autonomy. Victor, 
the spokesperson of the Church, welcomed us 
into the Church at Middletown without hesi­
tation, but he was also quick to shut down any 
complaints from former members that we shared 
with him. We got the sense that that was the 
kind of denial members were met with when they
raised questions.


College campuses have long been attractive 
to alleged cult organizations: the Moonies, the 
cult of Sarah Lawrence, Shincheonji. College 
students are often open-minded, but also at their 
most vulnerable—far from home and looking for 
a sense of community.


In 2018, the University of Memphis banned 
ASEZ from its campus because of its aggressive 
preaching practices. But other universities, like 
the University of Washington, feel that preach­
ing falls within freedom of speech, and instead 
just advise students to research online or ask a 
friend or advisor before joining something new. 
Yale administrators did not respond in time to a 
request for comment, so what Yale might choose 
to do, if anything, is unclear. This semester, there’s 
been a marked absence of ASEZ’s presence on 
campus—perhaps because the last known student 
to be a member of it has graduated—but dotted 
around campus are people handing out flyers for 
other churches, or sitting quietly besides maga­
zine stands of church pamphlets propped up on 
the street. It’s hard not to wonder what differenti­
ates these groups from ASEZ.


For now, though, and perhaps indefinitely, 
Kelsey will continue to be haunted by the pros­
pect of the world’s collapse and her condemna­
tion by a woman living in South Korea. ∎

sophomore in Grace Hopper College.
Her father’s death brought her some clar­
ity. He had a stroke, and his family, after days 
spent living with the possibility of him never 
returning to consciousness, made the decision to 
take him off of life support. The day the proce­
dure was meant to happen coincided with one 
of the Church’s feasts, but she was told she still 
had to be at the Church that day. “Even though 
I told them my dad’s dying in the hospital, and 
this is the day that they’re going to pull the 
plug,” Kelsey said. “They said, ‘Let the dead bury
their own dead.’”


But by that point, ten years in, the decision 
to leave the Church wasn’t easy. For one thing, 
all of her friends were in the Church, and while 
the Church as an organization is “toxic,” she 
said, the people you interact with on a daily basis 
are kind people who just got “caught up in this 
mess.” She was torn between wanting to leave, 
and believing that if she left she would be con­
demned to hell. She decided to take a break from 
the Church, but when she didn’t show up for one 
service, she was bombarded with texts asking 
where she was and if she was okay, and apolo­
gizing for not having paid enough attention to 
her. She found out that members of her church 
had circled her sister’s apartment block, looking 
for her car. When they showed up to her work, 
lying to get through security, she decided she had 
to take a formal break. She did her research and 
confronted the pastor with questions she knew 
he couldn’t answer. The nail in the coffin: why 
did the Church claim that its founder was pas­
tor Kim Joo-cheol, and not God the Father Ahn 
Sahng-hong, on its religious non-profit forms to 
the Internal Revenue Service?


Still, it took several months for Kelsey to 
stop believing in the Church’s doctrine. Five 
years on, she continues to have apocalyptic night­
mares, dreams where she is being burned alive or 
has to watch people burn up around her. She has 
been told by friends and family that she has some 
form of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and she 
still struggles to find joy in doing things that 
don’t have a purpose connected to the Church, 
like watching TV, watching movies, or listening 
to music.


“I struggle every single day because of this 
church,” Kelsey said. “The Church taught for the 
longest time that if you ever leave the Church 
of God, you will die, and you will die a horrible 
death. So whenever something bad happens, that 
always comes into my mind, even though I know 
that what they did is wrong.”


I
n the months since our first article, we’ve wres­
tled with the question of what makes some­
thing a cult, and what makes a cult dangerous, as 
opposed to just different. We previously spoke to 
Steven Hassan, a cult expert, about the difference 
between ethical cults and unethical or destructive 
cults. The key difference, he said, lies in whether 
or not members are deceived into joining.
