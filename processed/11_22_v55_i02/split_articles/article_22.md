“IN ESSENCE,
TOO MANY
PUBLIC BEACHES 
IN CONNECTICUT 
HAVE BECOME 
COUNTRY CLUBS.”


the towns’ wealthy and predominantly 
white residents. These fines are more 
than a summertime inconvenience: they 
perpetuate a persisting legacy of racial 
and economic exclusion in New England. 
They are emblematic of national man­
ifestations of rampant injustice which 
certainly do not begin or end at the coast.


The emergence of private beaches in 
Connecticut can be traced back to the 
1880s, when the state legislature granted 
a charter allotting self-government to 
affluent families who had converted 
Old Saybrook into their new vacation 
haven. Early twentieth century com­
mercial developers then bought up the 
state coastline, converting farm and for­
est lands into vacation homes packaged 
for middle-class whites. Charters barred 
non-residents from operating parks, 
beaches, and streets, and they explicitly 
enacted racially restrictive housing cov­
enants preventing Black and Jewish buy­
ers from becoming coastal homeowners.


Even after the Fair Housing Act was 
passed in 1968—which prohibited hous­
ing discrimination by landlords, munic­
ipalities and other housing providers on 
the basis of race, sex, religion, national 
origin, familial status and disability—
these racially discriminatory real estate 
practices persisted. Local policymakers 
made the switch to using language that 
centers one’s residential status to perpet­
uate these segregating measures. Today, 
thinly veiled, racially coded language 
bars “non-residents” from beachside 
parking or weekend beach access in 
beach towns like Westport. And, in 
many locales, these restrictions are also 
reflected in the accessibility of housing 
and renting. Combined, they make the 
possibility of a beach weekend in some 
regions in Connecticut unfeasible.”


“The towns that are most egregious 
in establishing these differential rates for 
parking are the towns that have made it 
almost impossible for folks to move into 
those communities,” Lemar reflects. He 
speaks with equal parts history teacher 
authority and soccer dad optimism. “The 
Greenwiches, 
the 
Fairfields . . . [these 
towns] have very restrictive zoning laws 
that don’t allow for multi-family homes 
or for new home construction. They 
essentially close off their borders pur­
posefully to new occupants. And then 
they say ‘our beaches are only for people 
who live here.’ ”


Today, Greenwich bans multi-fam­
ily housing on over 95 percent of its land, 
despite the fact that multi-family homes 
once drove the town’s suburban growth. 
This push to build a community made 
almost entirely of single-family homes, 
and therefore push out lower-class and 
often non-white residents, was bol­
stered by a 2017 Planning and Zoning 
Commission measure to formally ban 
multi-family developments in the neigh­
borhood. Fairfield has followed suit, as 
exhibited by some Fairfield homeowners’ 
active resistance to state-mandated 
affordable housing developments within 
their town in the interest of protecting 
their uniform wealth and whiteness.


Effectively denying out-of-towners 
and the non-wealthy access to the beach 
is part of a legacy of broader policy pat­
terns like restrictive zoning that continue 
to engender segregation in Connecticut 
neighborhoods. Andrew Kahrl, professor 
of history and African American stud­
ies at the University of Virginia, studies 
the environmental history of land use 
and segregation in the twentieth cen­
tury, particularly in Connecticut and 
the American South. An even-tem­
pered academic, he talked through the 
phone with a punchy, resolute tone. He 
unflinchingly classified Connecticut as 
a state whose restrictive beach practices 
had a clear racial effect, “even if they dis­
claimed racial intent.” He stressed that 
the creation of resident-only, private 
beaches in the Northeast served as an 
example of local government-sanctioned 
practices of blatant segregation.


“In practice, Connecticut is a pro­
foundly segregated state around racial 
and class lines,” Kahrl told me. “[White 
and wealthy] communities fight like hell 
to prevent affordable housing, equita­
ble public schools, and shared public 
resources.”

Karhl 
and Lemar refer to, local signage bear
