financial penalties, the act of doing so 
continues to be feasibly impractical. In 
response, in July of 2021, the American 
Civil Liberties Union named financially 
restrictive beach policies in counties like 
Greenwich and Westport as present day 
examples of de facto segregation. They 
also accused these measures of violat­
ing the Public Trust Doctrine, which 
ensures the public’s right to land above 
the mean high water line in coastal states 
like Connecticut. 

For the last two years, and most 
recently this past spring, Rep. Lemar 
has led the charge alongside other state 
government officials to push for reform 
through the enactment of HB 5361, an 
unpassed bill which aims to imple­
ment financial penalties to counties 
who do not abide by beach equity stan­
dards. After years of refraining from 
commenting on the subject, this spring, 
Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont—a 
Greenwich native—agreed there should 
be studies on the matter of beach access, 
withholding any definitive stance on the 
topic beyond supporting the “bipartisan 
effort to take a closer look at this import­
ant issue.” Lamont and other suburban 
shoreline candidates have sidelined this 
issue, likely due to an unwillingness to 
rock the political boat from the interests 
of politically influential suburbanites. 

“Voters don’t want studies, voters 
want solutions,” Rep. Winkler retorted 
on a call with me in July, urging the 
governor to both acknowledge and take 
a stand against systemic class and racial 
disparities by the coast. But months later, 
in November, Ned Lamont would go on 
to win re-election for governor.

Devienne 
acknowledges that coastal access 
is embedded in Californians’ sense 
of what is right and what is their right. 
Emboldened by the protections offered 
by the Coastal Commission and prec­
edent-setting efforts to fight for public 
space, they seem to possess an inherent 
belief that the every-day non-billion­
aire is entitled to coastal leisure, that 
one cannot simply weaponize their 
whiteness and wealth to warrant an 
unjustifiable claim over nature. Despite 
a deep-rooted history of exclusivity, 
evident in Connecticut’s implicit and 
explicit removal of Black and Brown 
beachgoers and beach town residents, a 
determined contingent of present-day 
Connecticut residenc seem to echo 
these sentiments for protected public
beach access.


Still, the environmental and social 
history of contested state and public 
land is irrefutably tied to the history of 
Indigenous removal, Black exclusion, 
and the preservation of whiteness in the 
outdoors, measures of erasure most often 
achieved through state violence. It may 
seem dangerous and illogical, therefore, 
to encourage state regulation as a means 
of pacifying the interests of local govern­
ments and rich landowners, and in turn 
addressing their particular wrongdoings, 
let alone in re-introducing a collective 
protection of leisure and the outdoors. 

While these reforms might successfully 
ensure the public right to access the out­
doors in legal terms, how these protec­
tions will manifest in government action, 
particularly as coastal lands become 
more and more of a scarce resource as the
climate crisis progresses, is yet to be seen.


What is certain is that exclusive 
beach access and its restrictive practices 
are extensions of long-ingrained systems 
of racial exclusion. And the protection 
of wealth and cementing of privilege 
come at a steep price: the perpetuation 
of a generations-spanning landmine of 
exclusion. All of this tug-of-war comes 
as climate-caused coastal flooding prom­
ises to wreak havoc on anybody unlucky 
enough to stand in its way, neither dis­
criminating by race nor class. It may be 
that the coastal beach-house billionaires 
are less territorial of their beachfront in 
the coming decades. It may be that as 
these beaches erode, so might the issue 
of beach access. Rest assured, however, 
that from coast to coast, there will con­
tinue to be calls to free whatever beach 
that remains. ∎
