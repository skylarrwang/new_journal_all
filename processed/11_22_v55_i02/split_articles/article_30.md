EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Our beloved miniature dachshund, Pip, went missing from our garden on Tuesday afternoon. He is brown and tan, short-legged, and answers to the name “Pip.” He’s wearing a small blue collar with a tag bearing our address.  A reward is offered for his safe return. Please call 555-1212 if you have seen him.
