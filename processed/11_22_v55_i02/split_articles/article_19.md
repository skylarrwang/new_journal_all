center, still embodies this emphasis on support, 
and its grassroots outreach program perhaps takes
it to new heights.
“White women activists asserted their moral 
authority by claiming to have special access to 
universal truths,” writes Holland. “And they tried 
to use that moral authority to transform the 
women of color, poor women, and young women 
who were the majority of the clients at [crisis 
pregnancy centers].” 

By the eighties, family support services 
weren’t producing the results crisis pregnancy 
center leaders desired for the amount of effort 
and resources they required. So they sought to 
focus on the client as well as the fetus. Abortion 
didn’t just hurt the fetus, it hurt the client, 
too. “Abortion-seeking women were no lon­
ger just victims of coercion or poverty,” writes 
Holland. “They were victims of abortion itself.” 

Anti-abortion activists began using the term 
“post-abortion syndrome,” which claims that abor­
tion causes post-traumatic-stress disorder-like ill­
ness. Diagnosis was loose, so almost anyone who 
had an abortion could be told they had a clinical 
condition attributable to the fact that they termi­
nated a pregnancy. The American Psychological 
Association (APA), the Journal of the American 
Medical Association, and similar organizations 
have never recognized the condition—meanwhile, 
the APA asserts that carrying an unwanted preg­
nancy to term increases risks for mental health 
and domestic abuse. But post-abortion syndrome 
still holds firm in all kinds of crisis pregnancy 
centers today. 

IOBMA is no exception: it offers “post-abor­
tion programs and support” on its website and, 
on at least one visit, there was a booklet on-site 
with guidance for “Identifying and Overcoming 
Post-Abortion Syndrome.” Solsbery even had 
a brochure for Rachel’s Vineyard, a weekend 
retreat program she said at least one of her cli­
ents has attended, with the slogan healing the pain 
of abortion—one weekend at a time. The program 
is offered at locations around the globe in both 
Catholic and non-denominational settings. The 
Connecticut outpost is in Farmington. 

Between kitchen table domestic quaintness, 
family values imbued through family services, 
and the creation of post-abortion syndrome, 
Holland writes that anti-abortionists “made the

supposedly intrinsic knowledge of fetal life cen­
tral to the female experience” in crisis pregnancy 
centers. Though it was founded in 2014, and is a 
long way from Solsbery’s home and those found­
ing crisis pregnancy centers on the west coast, 
there’s a time capsule of crisis pregnancy center 
tactics threading through IOBMA’s philosophy and 
practice. The history lives on.

And now, Solsbery said she is feeling hopeful 
about the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. 
Wade. “Look how many lives are going to be saved,” 
she said. “The schools are decreasing because of 
abortion.” In the first hand motion she’d made in 
an hour, she pressed her two hands down hard on 
top of each other on her desk. “This is facts.”

5. Full Circle
Up until November, the IOBMA recruitment for­
mula was a matter of summation. On an August 
12th visit, the props added up: six homemade dan­
gling rosaries, five pairs of sunglasses, two por­
table stools for those who don’t stand for long 
stretches, one plastic grocery bag filled with bro­
chures, seven lawn signs plugged into the grass. 
The result: one prayer circle straddling the side­
walk outside Planned Parenthood. It set the stage 
for a seemingly infinite recitation of the rosary.

Prayer kept to a schedule: 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 
p.m., Wednesdays and Fridays, each with a differ­
ent set of prayer regulars. Members of the Friday 
group said they are part of the same church—
Saint Mary’s Church in Clinton, Connecticut. 
On the Fridays I visited, the attendees dangling 
rosaries with Solsbery weren’t official volunteers 
or employees of the clinic—they just prayed, and 
maybe distributed some literature. The other 
helpers were the lawn signs: LIFE styled in 
the Game of Life font, ABORTION STOPS A 
BEATING HEART, PRAY TO END ABORTION, 
64,000 US LIVES LOST (except the 4 is a 3 that’s 
been x-ed out by hand with marker), a painting of 
the Virgin Mary.

But the real key to the equation, it seemed, 
happened when the circle broke. That sweaty 
day in August, one attendee, visibly the youngest, 
spearheaded the interruption. 

At first, she just seemed distracted. In between 
utterances of Hail Mary and pray for us sinners now, 
her eyes lifted from the scripture, past the vortex of 
the circle. Something caught her attention—then, 
more darting glances, a nudging of her neighbor. 
A mumble was exchanged, a decision was made. 
Someone shoved a pamphlet into her hands, and 
she started walking towards a young woman at 
the stoplight at Whitney and Edwards Street, 
headed away from Planned Parenthood. En route, 
her walk broke into a jog. Solsbery tagged behind, 
with even more urgency and more pamphlets. 
Later, Solsbery told me that the woman they

stopped was pregnant, that she seemed interested 
in IOBMA, and that she said she’d stop by. Back
on the sidewalk, prayer resumed. 

When first looking for Solsbery’s prayer circle 
in August, I accidentally approached a different 
group stationed at the Planned Parenthood side­
walk, on the other side of the parking lot. There, 
a woman handed me a brochure with more bla­
tant messaging than the one Solsbery distributed. 
Where Solsbery’s asked Pregnant? Worried?, this 
one straightforwardly implored PLEASE HAVE 
YOUR BABY. Where Solsbery’s included a draw­
ing of a fetus, this one was more photographic, 
with an insert displaying HUMAN GARBAGE—
fetus corpses in a trash can. Where IOBMA 
offered alternatives to abortion, this one pleaded 
To save the life of your BABY the LAMINARIA
(seaweed sticks) can STILL BE REMOVED.

But both brochures featured the same list of 
six crisis pregnancy centers in the Greater New 
Haven area and an abortion pill reversal hotline. 
IOBMA is the first on that list.

“They’re more vocal,” said Solsbery, referring 
to the other group. “We do the quiet approach.”

IOBMA’s sidewalk recruitment is getting qui­
eter, and getting centralized. Solsbery recently 
applied to and began a partnership with Sidewalk 
Advocates for Life—an organization with the 
mission statement to train, equip, and support com­
munities across the United States and the world in 
sidewalk advocacy: to be the hands and feet of Christ, 
offering loving, life-affirming alternatives to all pres­
ent at abortion facilities, thereby eliminating demand 
and ending abortion. The organization currently 
operates 239 sites nationwide, and is helping train 
new volunteers to revamp the IOBMA prayer ses­
sions outside Planned Parenthood. Solsbery said 
she realized that the old method was “intrusive,” 
and she wanted to make her sidewalk presence 
more approachable.

When I visited in November, Solsbery had 
already gained a new uniform and a goodie bag: 
a Sidewalk Advocates-branded blue traffic vest, 
and a pink-clothed sack containing Bath & Body 
Works lotion alongside some brochures. A few 
hundred feet away, in the middle of the parking 
lot, Planned Parenthood’s escorts stood emp­
ty-handed in neon pink traffic vests. 

Going forward, prayer will be moved fur­
ther away, to the other side of Edwards Street, 
while Solsbery will recruit alongside Sidewalk 
Advocates-trained volunteers where prayer hap­
pened. Solsbery said she’ll be distributing some 
additional literature: business cards for hotlines—
Love Line and Option Line—that connect call­
ers to local crisis pregnancy centers. The signs are 
coming down, too, and being replaced by a sin­
gle sign advertising the link and hotline of the 
Abortion Pill Rescue Network. Abortion rever­
sal—advertised as a counteracting treatment to 
medication abortion—is based on “unproven and 
unethical research,” according to the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
