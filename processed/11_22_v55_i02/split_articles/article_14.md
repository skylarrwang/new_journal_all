of you and still be faithful.” Kelsey felt that to 
be prepared she had to be constantly preaching, 
studying the Bible, or doing work for the Church.

Kelsey and other former members recounted 
frequent offerings that were required by members, 
including a tithe of 10 percent of your annual pre-
tax income. Victor emphasized the importance of 
a tithe as a biblical teaching, but said there is “free 
will” with every teaching of God, explaining that 
the tithe is not enforced. After all, he said, God 
wants a “cheerful giver.”

A 10 percent tithe is described in the Bible 
in Deuteronomy and is also required by some 
churches including the Seventh-day Adventists 
and the Church of Latter-day Saints, but is vol­
untary for the most part in other churches in
the United States. 

Kelsey, however, told a different story.
“They say they don’t require anybody to tithe, 
and that’s a lie,” Kelsey said. “When I first joined, 
all I was required [to give] was tithes and offer­
ings . . . but the more I got involved in the Church, 
the more that they started asking me for.”

Eventually, half of Kelsey’s salary was going 
to the Church. She was purchasing lights for the 
building, cooking for the whole congregation 
twice a month, and, when she became a leader in 
the Portland branch, she was spending an addi­
tional $250 to $300 a month to provide meals on 
sabbath days for up to 120 regular members. If 
there were seminars, construction at the Church, 
or materials needed for the children’s classes, 
Kelsey also had to front the cost. “It got to the 
point where by the time I left the Church, roughly 
40 to 50 percent of my paycheck was going to the 
Church every month,” she said.

When asked about members like Kelsey hav­
ing to spend large sums of money, Victor said, “I 
don’t know what that means.” 

Anthony also recalled having to give large 
sums of money. He said every time you receive a 
paycheck, you were told to tithe 10 percent of your 
pre-tax income and “always round up” if there was 
change involved. There would be an offering on 
Saturday at each of the three services, and once a 
month, there would be a “brown envelope” which 
goes to international churches or towards plan­
ning for church missions and included a “thank 
offering” that members contribute to once a 
month. In addition to these donations to the 
Church, they also have “the feasts of God” which 
are special celebrations involving at least seven­
teen different ceremonies throughout the year, 
each of which requires extra donations in two 
offerings per service, on top of food donations or 
donations towards specific events.

“I’m sure that some of it goes towards the 
upkeep of the building, but even when they do 
construction work, a lot of the time the members 
are just contributing more and more,” Anthony 
said. “So it seems limitless, how much they ask the 
members to give, and you don’t really see where 
it goes. It seems like they just take tithes and 
offerings and they completely put it aside, and 
then the members continue to feed into upkeep­
ing the building and the food and everything like 
that to keep it sustained. Typically, you’d see the 
tithe go towards that, but it doesn’t.”

Tom said church leaders would ask for dona­
tions and give members a week to provide the do- 
nation. In his case, he donated around $300 in total.


O
n George’s second visit to the main tem­
ple in Korea, he and his mother, like other 
members, lined up to meet Zahng after the 
service. When it came time for his mother and 
him to go up, George was confused. Without 
George saying anything, the translator described 
to Zahng his struggles with drug abuse, and 
about how his father had stopped sending child 
support to them, and her face dropped. “It was 
the weirdest thing,” he said, stunned by the fact 
that the translator knew and was sharing such 
sensitive information about him with someone 
who—as God—he assumed would already know 
everything. These were things he had only told 
his church leader back home, under the assump­
tion that it was confidential. He later found out 
that the Church reported his situation to the 
elder of the Church, who then passed it onto 
the headquarters in South Korea. He felt “vio­
lated” and disturbed that his intimate struggles 
were being openly discussed, just so that Zahng 
could tell him “everything’s gonna be alright,
it will get better.”


George said that the Church frequently 
shared such sensitive information without mem­
bers’ consent. He told us that the same thing hap­
pened to some of his friends in the Church who 
were conflicted about their sexuality, or were in 
relationships that weren’t ordained. The Church 
would tell George that God the Mother knew 
these things, because she is all-knowing, but 
when he questioned why Zahng even needed a 
translator, the deacon at his church in California 
told him that she’s God in human form, and 
that in the same way, Jesus had physical aspects 
that made other people doubt and crucify him. 
They would tell him that he shouldn’t ques­
tion those things, because “God’s thoughts are
higher than ours.”

Still, Zahng’s generosity isn’t fiction. During 
George’s visit to Korea with his mother, he 
learned that the Church had given his father 
$5,000 for child support—because he had refused 
to on his own—and the Church wanted to fix 
that relationship and ensure his father, a mis­
sionary for the Church, wouldn’t lose face. But 
George and his mother never got the money; 
they never even knew it existed until Zahng 
asked him about it. Zahng ended up giving 
them $2,000 in a brown envelope, which George 
felt was like an “emotional investment.” He 
was conflicted, because he was grateful for the 
money and still steadfast in his beliefs, but the 
money also made him feel even more tied to the

Church, like he was indebted for something that
he was actually owed.

“It was a very hard moment to know that he 
used that money from the Church,” George said. 
“I don’t know what it was for, maybe he just gave 
it back to the Church, but I felt very manipulated 
after finding out that she gave me $2,000 and 
gave $5,000 to my dad, but she’s just recycling our 
tithes and offerings so that they could keep us in.”

T
he Church’s presence on campus isn’t new. 
After our first article in May, we learned 
that students have been approached on campus 
since as early as 2018. One Yale student wrote 
on Twitter that she was approached during her 
first year in 2018. Although she wasn’t alone, the 
Church members ignored her friend who is a 
man, focusing all their attention on her. After 
she explained to them that she was a practicing 
Muslim and was not interested in “expanding” her 
views, she wrote, they tried to tell her that God 
the Mother “worked under all major religions.”

The members had told her that they were 
Yale Divinity School students and were trying to 
form an official club on campus. We weren’t able 
to identify any current or former students at Yale, 
besides Davornne and Ashley, who are members 
of the Church. 

Another student wrote that he was “followed” 
from Cross Campus back to Bingham Hall in his 
first year by members of the Church. “I had to run 
into the entryway to escape,” he wrote.

Outside of Yale, ASEZ has chapters at the 
University of Connecticut, Antelope Valley 
College, Indiana University-Purdue University 
Indianapolis (IUPUI), New York University, Old 
Dominion University, Bronx Community College, 
and Lehman College. 

The chapter at the University of Connecticut 
holds active meetings, including “paint and plant” 
events, game nights, and general body meetings. 
The other college chapters nationwide are often 
highlighted for their service work by local news 
outlets, including planting trees or cleaning up 
local areas.

G
eorge moved back to the United States as 
a child and grew up attending one of the 
Church locations in California. “It was a part of 
my whole childhood,” George said. “Everyone 
that I knew in the Church would be considered 
family. I didn’t know anything else. I didn’t know 
how other services went at other churches or just 
how normal people outside my church acted.”

Each Saturday, the children would be brought 
to a separate room, while the adults went for ser­
vices. “It wasn’t a good place for kids to strive and 
it’s very depressing, all we do is study the Word 
of God. But it was back to back, and we were just 
kids,” George said.

Sealed away in a room all day, he would learn 
to recite “Mother’s Teachings” which were Zahng 
Gil-jah—God the Mother’s—thirteen teachings. 
For as long as their parents were in the services or 
Bible studies, the children were studying the teach­
ings. This sometimes meant that they were there 
from 9 a.m., when the first service began, to around 
9 or 10 p.m., when the third service ended, with
just short breaks to go outside or eat. “We never 
had time to sleep,” George recalled. “If we slept, we 
would be woken up. We’re never able to close our
eyes, we’d have to always be looking at the Bible.”

Kelsey, for a time, was in charge of teach­
ing children on Sabbath days. She taught a 
group of children ages 3 to 15 for the entire day
every Saturday.

“5-year-olds, I had to teach them how to find 
the verses in the Bible and then repeat the sub­
jects and test them,” Kelsey said. “Children were 
expected to bring their classmates, their teachers, 
their friends and families [into the Church].”

Kelsey added that at the end of the day, she 
would meet with other members of leadership 
and was expected to divulge any issues or prob­
lems her students were facing, including things 
said to her in confidence.

As her role in the Church ramped up, Kelsey 
found that she was committing every moment 
outside of work to the Church. Everyday after 
work, she would be at the Church or around cam­
puses preaching until around 10 p.m., then after 
getting back home, she would study for another 
two hours, and the next day she would do it all 
over again.

“There were no days off, absolutely no days,” 
Kelsey said. “I lost every single friend I ever had.”

he Church’s hold on its members extended 
to anything that was considered “earthly”—
anything that might take you away from your 
heavenly family. That meant non-religious music, 
movies, sports, and internet use were discouraged; 
work was largely thought of as a means to better 
contribute towards the Church; and connections 
with family, friends, and romantic partners had to 
center the Church.

Less than a year after Anthony joined the 
Church, a head pastor had asked him how he 
was doing. ”You should be thinking about a fam­
ily,” he said, suggesting that he marry a member

Anthony had previously heard rumors about 
arranged marriages, but felt thrown off-guard. 
When he told the pastor that he hadn’t given it 
any thought before, the leader of the Church told 
him to “look around” and tell them who he liked. 
“They say that if you get married, you have a lot 
more opportunity to be blessed by God,” Anthony 
said. Anthony ended up marrying a woman the 
pastor first suggested in October of 2012, a year 
and three months after joining the Church and 
just a few months after their first date. They had 
met before, but never really spoken, and after four 
months, they went to different locations. After 
only two dates, they were told they had to decide 
whether or not they would marry each other.

Anthony told us he’d been asked to relocate 
multiple times over the decade that he was in the 
Church. That, in addition to the late hours spent 
at the Church—sometimes staying up until 1 or 
2 a.m.—meant that it was difficult to maintain a 
stable career. In 2012, he lost a job he had worked 
for six years—he started messing up at work 
because of the late nights. Once he found a new 
job, the Church told him it was time to be married. 
On the day of his wedding, the pastor told him 
that he and his wife should move to Florida, but 
he never gave Anthony an explicit reason. Moving 
to Florida meant that he’d have to give up his new 
job, spend some time finding new work, and—
because he went from a management position to 
an administrative position—live on half his previ­
ous wages. But he did it, because the Church told 
him to. He relocated three more times after that 
with his wife. They stayed married for nine years.

“We went through a lot of ups and downs, 
especially at the beginning, getting used to being 
married to a stranger,” Anthony said. “Looking 
back, being married out of fear, and out of the 
fear of condemnation, it definitely feels wrong 
for both of us. I feel like to have an expectation 
for somebody to marry a stranger . . . and doing it 
under threat, it’s kind of hard to express, because, 
in essence, you just feel like you’re forced to be in 
this intimate relationship with somebody that you 
haven’t chosen . . . Ultimately, you’re only doing it 
because you’re obedient to the Church.”

“Let me ask you this,” Victor said when we 
asked him if the Church conducted arranged 
marriages, smirking. “Let’s say you and I, we go 
to a party, and I introduce you to a friend of mine. 
‘I think maybe you guys can make a cute couple, 
you want to get to know him?’ Would you say
I’m arranging a marriage?”

Victor was introduced to his wife, who is 
Korean, by his pastor in 2009. They were married 
a year later. “I got to know her, and we went on 
a date, and we went on a few dates, we dated for 
some time, and then we decided to get married.”

Kelsey said that the Church showed mem­
bers a verse in the Old Testament that said that 
Jews should not mingle with gentiles, in order to 
justify why members should only marry within 
the Church. “In the same way we are spiritual 
Jews, and we don’t need to mingle with the people 
of the outside world,” she said.

K
elsey left the Church in 2017, ten years after 
joining. The process of leaving was difficult 
for her, because by that point she was utterly con­
vinced that the end of the world was approach­
ing. She left, not because she stopped believing 
in the Church, but because she was so burnt out 
from its demands that she realized she physically 
wasn’t able to keep going. She had been told that 
she was “lazy” and “wasn’t working hard enough.” 
The reason her parents died, church authorities 
said, was because she wasn’t preaching as much 
as she should be.
