EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Most of the symbolism in the office of In Our 
Blessed Mother’s Arms (IOBMA), a family center 
in New Haven, falls into two categories: babies 
and the Biblical.

First, the religious decor. Scattered around 
on surfaces and shelves, there are the miniatures: 
figurines of the pope, an angel, a nativity scene, a 
friar. Virgin Mary statues—white-glazed, gold, 
ivory, and blue—tower by comparison. One
is knee-high. 
The baby paraphernalia, on the other hand, 
is more life-sized: there’s a baby-sized baby doll 
for a baby to play with, fetus-sized fetus dolls that 
are handed out to potential clients on the street, a 
brochure illustration of “a tiny person—his actual 
size and appearance . . .” in the womb. On the walls, 
there’s a variety of babies of different races on 
posters inscribed with messages like Life is Precious, 
Celebrate Life! and Babies are Blessing Choose Life! 
And in photographs populating a corkboard,
there are the babies of IOBMA’s clientele.

From the outside, the office building could 
be mistaken for someone’s home: yellow siding, a 
rust-painted stoop with a little fleur-de-lis carved 
into the awning, ruched sheer curtains frozen 
behind the glass. Instead, it houses a dentist’s 
office on the first floor and IOBMA on the second. 
The next door neighbors—the New Haven Fire 
Department to the right, a white-pillar mansion 
on the left—appear less cozy. Together, the trio 
makes for an unlikely group: a place to deal with 
fire, a place to live in grandeur, and a place to deal 
with a pregnancy.


Ivana Solsbery, the owner and Director of the 
family center, sat at her desk, still recovering from 
her twice-weekly, two-hour prayer session outside 
New Haven’s Planned Parenthood. Just out the 
window across from her, on the other side of the 
street, Planned Parenthood’s THESE DOORS 
STAY OPEN banner drifted in the breeze.

Set against the nationally recognizable 
shadow of Planned Parenthood and the lib­
eral landscape of Connecticut, In Our Blessed 
Mother’s Arms seems like an obscure outpost. 
But there are similar sites found all over the coun­
try, most commonly known as crisis pregnancy 
centers. Their definitions generally circle the 
Guttmacher Institute’s, which describes them as 
“organizations that provide counseling and other 
prenatal services from an antiabortion (prolife) 
perspective.” They have a few analogous labels—
including pregnancy resource centers, limited 
pregnancy service centers, pregnancy care clinics, 
or, more pejoratively, fake health clinics. IOBMA is 
a reflection of this naming tedium: Solsbery and 
the center’s website call it a family center, but its 
Facebook page says it’s a “Pregnancy Resource 
and Outreach Center.” It offers services that 
many crisis pregnancy centers offer—and then 
some—and serves mostly pregnant clients. Like

other centers, it does not provide referrals for 
abortion, and its website has a disclaimer that it’s 
“not a pro-abortion organization.”


IOBMA doesn’t operate like all crisis preg­
nancy centers in the country—by nature, they 
are varied and shifting. Beyond its relatively 
obscure appearance, IOBMA is functionally a hum­
ble operation, too: it’s a one-woman-show that 
usually helps just a couple pregnant clients at a 
time, offering resources and supplies to help cli­
ents through pregnancy and childrearing. IOBMA 
doesn’t compete with Planned Parenthood 
because it doesn’t offer abortion services, and 
perhaps it even helps supplement the clinic’s 
family services. But Planned Parenthood’s recog­
nizability helps IOBMA more. It helps IOBMA
help others.


**Title: A State of Crisis**
**Page number(s): 35-36**

Many of today’s crisis pregnancy centers present 
as legitimate clinics. But they lack the medical 
licensing and regulations, such as federal privacy 
laws, that health facilities are bound by. They don’t 
support abortion. If they mention abortion as a 
pregnancy option with clients, they don’t provide 
referrals—though that caveat isn’t always clear 
in their messaging. They often offer a swath of 
useful services for free, like pregnancy tests, ultra­
sounds, and basic supplies like diapers, cribs, and 
baby clothes. But these services can come at a cost, 
such as false information about pregnancy and 
the risks of abortion, required parenting course­
work in exchange for free services, the failure to 
provide diagnoses or accurate readings of ultra­
sounds, and, crucially, clients’ time—with the 
potential consequence of delaying prenatal care, 
sometimes until it’s too late for a legal abortion 
to be an option. 

Tracing back to the sixties, these clinics 
have historically served clients who are primar­
ily low-income, young, and people of color with 
friendliness, family services that address some 
of their clients’ real needs, and a medical posture 
to boot. They have a legacy of persuading clients 
to carry their pregnancies to term with white 
women at their helm.

Abortion has been legal in Connecticut since 
1990. But, in anticipation of the overturning of 
Roe v. Wade this June, Connecticut enshrined 
legal protections for out-of-state abortion seek­
ers. Those provisions were set in May, just a few 
weeks after the Dobbs decision was leaked, in 
House Bill 5414, which also expanded the pool of 
providers who can perform abortions and short­
ened abortion wait times to two weeks. This bill 
now makes Connecticut one of two “safe har­
bor” states in the country, alongside New York, 
which passed similar legislation in June. One 
Connecticut abortion clinic—Hartford GYN 
Center in Bloomfield—has since seen patients 
come from states as far as Ohio, Tennessee, and 
Texas, according to Roxanne Sutocky, the clinic’s 
Director of Community Engagement.

Across the US, estimates of the number of cri­
sis pregnancy centers range anywhere from 1,500 
to 5,000—the data isn’t reported by states, the 
centers, or otherwise collected in a streamlined 
way. We at least know that they vastly outnumber 
the 807 abortion clinics in the US reported by the 
Guttmacher Institute. That imbalance will grow 
as the number of clinics continues to shrink post-
Roe and the demand for crisis pregnancy centers 
subsequently grows. In Connecticut, there are at 
least twenty crisis pregnancy centers, compared to 
fifteen licensed abortion clinics.

A given crisis pregnancy center might have 
a few revenue streams: donations, national 
anti-abortion organizations that fund and direct 
thousands of affiliate centers, and—though not 
in Connecticut—state tax dollars. Nationwide, 
crisis pregnancy centers receive five times more 
funding than legitimate abortion funds and clin­
ics. They’re typically 501(c)(3) nonprofits, which 
means they qualify for federal income tax-exemp­
tions, and their tax returns don’t have to be public. 
This means they can often offer their services for 
free. Many centers open locations near abortion 
clinics, college campuses, and in low-income 
neighborhoods.

Roxanne Sutocky told me that, between 
the network of abortion clinics she works with 
in Connecticut as a Community Engagement 
Director for The Women’s Centers (which 
includes Hartford GYN), patients tend to encoun­
ter crisis pregnancy centers in some capacity 
before coming into contact with a legitimate 
clinic. In part, that’s because they are some of 
the top hits that come up when you search terms 
online related to pregnancy or abortion options in 
Connecticut. “We hear people coming to us and 
regurgitating the misinformation that we hear 
from anti-abortion centers,” she said. “It’s unfor­
tunate because, for many people, it’s very unclear 
to them that the person that they’re engaging 
with or the website that they’re looking at is actu­
ally an anti-abortion entity.”

In Greater New Haven alone, there are 
at least four crisis pregnancy centers besides 
IOBMA—there’s Mary and Joseph’s Place in 
North Haven; Birthright of Greater New Haven 
in Hamden; Carolyn’s Place Pregnancy Care 
Center located across the street from Waterbury 
Hospital; and Saint Gianna Pregnancy Resource 
Center, which operates out of a mobile van and a 
building nestled next to the New Haven Hospital 
Saint Raphael Campus in New Haven’s Dwight 
neighborhood. Meanwhile, there’s only one 
licensed abortion clinic in New Haven. And it’s 
IOBMA’s neighbor.


**Title: Like Mother**

“I knew in my heart that one day I would be doing 
this,” said Solsbery, with a gesture around the 
office. “Because I came from where they’re at.”

She’s talking about her clients—pregnant 
mothers seeking help in this den of religious and 
infant paraphernalia. But those clients are hard to 
find. I tried reaching out to IOBMA clients for this 
piece, but wasn’t able to talk to them—because of 
a discomfort with speaking publicly, because the 
office was empty, or because Solsbery wanted to 
protect their privacy, citing legal binding by the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA). (By definition, as a medically unli­
censed clinic, IOBMA is not bound by HIPAA).

In 2014, Solsbery founded IOBMA as a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit pregnancy resource center at 340 
Whitney Avenue. A Catholic, Solsbery was six­
teen when she had her first child and struggled to 
find resources to help her navigate single mother­
hood, which she said were less plentiful back then. 
Now, she’s a great-grandmother—and thanks 
God she had her child, because she had to have 
a hysterectomy at age twenty-one. “That’s why I 
always say people regret abortions, but they never 
regret a child,” she said.

Ivana Solsbery’s got blue-green eyes, long 
blond hair, and she’s light on her feet. She treads 
calmly, to the tune of utter cacophony—a medley 
of syncopated key jangling, colliding rosary beads, 
and a cell phone that rings every ninety or so sec­
onds. It’s usually spam, sometimes business. She 
puts up with the noise, maybe even likes it—in 
fact, she’s working on setting up two more phones 
in the center soon. 

It’s hard to imagine Solsbery doing her job in 
the quiet. That would mean staying still, or put­
ting down her things. Solsbery’s role at IOBMA 
is anything but a traditional, stationary desk 
job. Her other titles might be informal, but she 
simultaneously does the work of a recruiter, client 
counselor, fundraiser, volunteer coordinator, trea­
surer, and delivery service driver, among others. 
She’s on the go.

“We gotta keep it moving,” she said. “If they 
need something, whatever it may be, we do our 
whole power to get it done . . . We’ve never not 
gotten it done.” Solsbery told me she ends up 
doing a lot of the IOBMA work alone, but she often 
describes her work using the “we” pronoun, not an 
“I”. Perhaps she doesn’t give herself enough credit, 
or perhaps the “we” is more figurative. Still, she 
said she keeps some things separate from the “we.”

“I don’t push my religion on anybody,” she said. 
“All I’m here to do is to try to help.”

That’s Solsbery’s articulation of her mis­
sion. The IOBMA mission statement on its web­
site is more specific: As the Lord’s purveyor of 
hope and the Mother’s helpers, our mission is to love 
mothers and children, make them our friends for life,
and end abortion.

On the latter point of the IOBMA mission, 
Solsbery said, “We don’t refer for an abortion.” 
Still, she explained, “that doesn’t mean that we 
don’t talk about it, don’t discourage it or anything. 
That’s up to the individual. All we do is give the 
truth. They want it, they can come. If they don’t, 
that’s their choice also.”

But what are Solsbery’s personal beliefs 
about the truth? Here are her main points about 
abortion:

“I don’t know, that’s my opinion,” said Solsbery.

Solsbery has her beliefs. She said she’s 
upfront with clients that she’s Catholic, but that 
it’s “not an issue at all . . . because we’re just here 
to help and they know that.” Her beliefs about 
abortion don’t disrupt the IOBMA operation: “We 
set them down and show them their options,
from abortion to medical.” 
But Solsbery also explained that “it’s sad that 
our society . . . can’t see life within the woman, and 
it’s not her choice—I’m sorry, she has another 
individual in her now, the child’s in the world 
because she’s in the world.” 

Still, Solsbery said she has helped fund abor­
tion for at least one client in the past. But neither 
the center’s website nor the blue brochure distrib­
uted on the sidewalk advertise that IOBMA offers 
anything about abortion—information, funding, 
referrals, or otherwise. The services that the cen­
ter does advertise online include housing, emer­
gency food and transportation, financial and legal 
aid, pre-natal care, baby supplies, post-abortion 
programs and support, adoption information, and 
sexually transmitted disease education. Solsbery 
said she also helps pay utility bills and rent, as 
well as find babysitters and jobs for clients. Most 
of her clients are pregnant, she said, and the num­
ber she’s working with at a given moment can 
usually range from one to seven.

There’s another service, which makes up the 
second half of the mission statement of IOBMA.

“It’s like a cancer in our world that’s spreading everywhere.”
(The national rate of legal abortion has declined steadily since the eighties, 
according to the Guttmacher Institute, except for an eight percent increase
in 2020.)
“For me, rape is a very very evil act done to an individual, but abortion’s
evil also, so you’re going to hurt this person two times?”
(According to the American Psychological Association, being denied an abor­
tion has a greater impact on mental health than receiving a wanted abortion.)
“You have another separate human being inside you that doesn’t give you 
the right to kill it, it just doesn’t. I mean that’s more brutal than African 
Americans being enslaved to all of this Holocaust—this is more than any
war, more human beings.”
“There’s been a lot of women who have died from [abortion].”
(The mortality rate for legal abortion in the United States is 0.7 deaths per 
100,000 procedures. By contrast, the maternal mortality rate is 23.8 deaths
per 100,000 births, as of 2020, according to the Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention. The maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black women
is 55.3 per 100,000.)
