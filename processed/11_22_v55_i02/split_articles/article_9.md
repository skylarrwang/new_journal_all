and that students and teachers have 
“shared concerns, experiences, values, and 
should have shared action.”

The concerns that Blatteau and her 
colleagues saw emerge in conversations 
with teachers—especially the stagnant 
pay, despite growing responsibilities—
were similar to those I heard. All of the 
teachers I interviewed said they worked 
more than the 6.75-hour day stipulated 
in their contract. Kris Wetmore, a visual 
arts teacher at New Haven’s Cooperative 
Arts & Humanities High School, told 
me she’s improving her work-life bal­
ance and trying not to work beyond 7:30 
a.m. to 2:15 p.m., “the hours I’m getting 
paid for.” Still, Wetmore admitted that 
she usually has to get to work early and 
spend some time working on weekends 
to prepare for the week’s lessons. Jett 
added, “If any of us just worked for the 
6.75-hour day, no one would get anything 
done.” No one felt that their pay fairly 
compensated these long hours. 
Boroski feels low teacher pay reveals 
the city’s priorities. “I know no one gets 
into this job for the money, but . . . the sal­
ary in New Haven is a reflection of the 
lack of respect for teachers.”


T
eachers have long been subject to 
lower salaries than similarly educated 
professionals for their demanding work. 
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020, Blatteau explained, wages stag­
nated when the city negotiated a pay 
freeze that stopped the regular schedule 
of raises stipulated in the union contract. 
Since teacher pay schedules lay out pay 
for a teacher’s entire career, a one-year 
pay freeze meant that teachers were set 
back a full year in their schedule of raises. 
“This really robs teachers who are going 
into retirement because their pensions 
are dependent on their salary,” Baumann 
said, emphasizing the impact of pay 
freezes on long-term teachers.


Local activists and union organiz­
ers have attributed the deficit in New 
Haven public school funding to Yale’s 
paltry contributions to the city. Davarian 
Baldwin is a political science professor 
at Trinity College and Director of the 
Smart Cities Lab, which facilitates col­
laboration with eleven cities on problems 
involving municipal services includ­
ing public transportation, housing, and 
schools. In the past, Baldwin has worked 
with New Haven Rising, a local activ­
ist group whose demands include an 
increased voluntary contribution from 
Yale. Baldwin said that top colleges like 
Yale are “built on the plunder of their cit­
ies,” and he highlighted Yale’s property 
tax break as a prime example.


Daniel HoSang is professor of 
Ethnicity, Race and Migration at 
Yale and a founding member of the 
Anti-Racist Teaching and Learning 
Collaborative. He, Blatteau, and Wilbur 
Cross counselor Mia Cormulada helped 
me understand the complex structure 
that determines public school funding, 
which in turn determines teacher salaries. 
School funding is allocated at a few lev­
els: first, the city of New Haven deter­
mines its annual budget, which includes 
all of the money that will be used for 
municipal services in the city. This 
money comes primarily from property 
taxes (New Haven’s city assessor, Alex 
Pullen, did not respond to questions 
about local funding, which accounts for 
58.8 percent of total school funding). 
Funding from property taxes does 
not include money from Yale’s volun­
tary contribution to the city, which was 
$23.2 million this year. In 2019, activists 
in New Haven Rising estimated that 
Yale would have paid $146,079,896 if 
its property was taxed as private, 40 per­
cent of the $364,659,346 total public 
school budget for New Haven that year. 
Yale’s property holdings in New Haven
are increasing every year.


The district gets a small amount of 
funding—approximately 4 percent in 
2020—from the federal government, 
and the city also gets 37.3 percent of 
school funding from the state, includ­
ing money from the Payment in Lieu of 
Taxes (PILOT) program. The PILOT pro­
gram gives $90 million in state funding 
to New Haven to make up for property 
tax revenue lost because of the city’s 
large swaths of untaxed property, mostly 
owned by Yale and Yale New Haven 
Health. When it comes to Yale’s tax 
break, this still leaves about $56 million
unaccounted for.


Baldwin likened Yale’s tax break to 
a subsidy that New Haven grants the 
University each year. When discuss­
ing his work with New Haven Rising, 
Baldwin said, “We want to create pol­
icies that induce schools like Yale to be 
better neighbors.” Blatteau added, “Yale 
could really right the wrongs of the his­
toric underfunding of public schools that 
they have contributed to by taking up so 
much untaxed property.”


Lauren Zucker, Yale’s associate 
vice president for New Haven Affairs 
and University Properties, responded 
to questions about Yale’s relationship 
with New Haven in an email: “Yale is 
proud of its commitment to our home 
city . . . the University pays approximately 
$5 million in property taxes . . . making 
Yale among the top three real estate 
taxpayers in New Haven.” She also 
emphasized Yale’s cultural contributions 
to the city, including the University’s 
Pathways to Science and Pathways 
to Arts and Humanities programs for
New Haven Public School students and 
Yale’s public museums.


Zucker cited Yale’s recent “historic 
increase” in voluntary payments to the 
city, and this year’s $23.2 million contri­
bution. $23.2 million is 15.7 percent of 
what Yale would pay if its buildings were 
taxed like private property, according to 
the 2019 calculations from New Haven 
Rising cited earlier. Yale’s voluntary con­
tribution still leaves New Haven about 
$33 million short in property tax revenue. 
HoSang added that Yale is not 
entirely to blame for the harms its 
untaxed property has wrought on the 
city. “After all, Yale didn’t author the laws 
that keep it from paying taxes,” he said. 
Yale’s status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit orga­
nization means that the school is exempt 
from all taxes on educational property 
buildings where instruction takes place.


New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker 
acknowledged that there is much work 
to be done to secure adequate funding for 
public schools, but he said, “We’re seeing 
both [Yale and the state of Connecticut] 
take significant steps to address these 
problems.” 
Elicker 
attributed 
the
lack of money for schools to Connecticut 
counties’ overreliance on city-limited 
property tax revenue. Property taxes 
from suburbs and rural areas around 
New Haven don’t contribute to the 
city’s revenue. In contrast, Elicker said 
that other states distribute funding by 
county, spreading property tax revenue 
more evenly. New Haven schools would 
be better funded if the city adopted this 
system. Still, in Elicker’s view, “the city 
of New Haven works very hard with very 
limited resources to support funding for 
our public schools.”


Even within the district, however, 
funding is unequally distributed. Jett told 
me that the Wexler Grant Community 
school, a mile away from his school 
between Dixwell Avenue 
and Canal Street, has 
two 
sixth-grade 
class­
rooms and twenty-three 
sixth graders. In smaller 
settings, 
teachers 
can 
work with each student 
to meet their needs. The 
school district’s spokes­
person, 
Justin 
Harmon, 
explained 
how funding is allocated in an email: 
“Neighborhood schools vary in enroll­
ments as the population around them 
swells or declines,” he said. “Wexler is in a
period of decline. Over time, the district 
makes staffing and program adjustments 
in an effort to rebalance the distribution 
of students and teachers from school 
to school.” Blatteau maintains that the 
public school deficit is an illusion: “If 
schools were a genuine priority,” she said, 
“the city would find the money.”


I
f Jett worked in Norwalk, a majority 
white town with a median house­
hold income of $89,486, he’d be making 
$64,355, according to a salary compar­
ison chart prepared by the New Haven 
teacher’s union. If he worked thirty 
minutes away in Westport, a city that 
is 86.5 percent white and where the 
median household income is $222,375, 
he’d make $77,721. In New Haven, 
where the median household income is 
$44,507, he makes only $50,440. A por­
tion of Jett’s modest paycheck goes back 
into his classroom.


To make up for the things his 
school can’t buy, Jett keeps his classroom 
stocked by spending his own money. 
While we were on the phone, Jett pulled 
up his Amazon purchase history for 
the last few months, going back to just 
before the school year started. Adding up 
the money that he spent on books, paper, 
pencils, markers, craft supplies, and 
toys demonstrating mathematical con­
cepts, Jett estimated that he spent close 
to $4,000 on supplies for his classroom 
this summer. What the school is able to 
provide often arrives after the year has 
started. Teachers who didn’t make sim­
ilar purchases sometimes begin the year 
without books. Baumann has experi­
enced these delays, and now buys most 
of the materials needed for experiments 
with his own money. All of the teachers 
I interviewed said they spend some of 
their own money on classroom supplies, 
but amounts ranged from a few hun­
dred dollars to Jett’s $4,000. Still, they
choose to stay.


W
hen asked if he has considered leav­
ing the district, Baumann said, “I 
think about it every day.” He knows sev­
eral teachers who have left just this year. 
Still, he plans to stay for the next year 
and a half until he retires: “I . . . honestly 
enjoy the eighth-grade team teachers 
that I’m working with, and I’m proba­
bly staying here more for them than for 
myself or the kids right now.”


Blatteau said, “Teachers who switch 
districts love New Haven, but I don’t 
blame them.”


Comulada agreed. “People need to 
feed their families, Maybe [leaving] is in 
their self-care bucket,” she said, acknowl­
edging also that pay across districts “isn’t 
an even-steven.”


Those teachers who do stay in New 
Haven remain excited about the district’s 
potential, and Blatteau said that “this isn’t 
a crisis without an answer.” The union’s 
current leadership is advocating for the 
things rank-and-file teachers want, like 
smaller class sizes and pay that adjusts 
to the rising cost of living. In prepara­
tion for the election, candidates—all of 
whom are teachers themselves—worked 
to increase member engagement in the 
union, responding to criticisms that 
there wasn’t enough information avail­
able about union activity.


Though he acknowledges that pay
and conditions are better at other 
schools, Jett said, “New Haven is one of 
the only districts in Connecticut where 
kids’ and families’ voices are heard, where 
we’re really trying to fix these problems.” 
Where other districts promised inclu­
sion but often fell short, in New Haven, 
“everyone’s doing their best to get kids 
up to where they need to be.” Still, as 
Blatteau and her colleagues in the union 
understand, teaching in New Haven is 
unsustainable for many teachers.


Things are looking up, though. In 
November, the city’s Board of Education 
approved a new teacher contract that 
will incrementally increase salaries over 
three years, according to the New Haven 
Register. In July of 2023, wages will 
increase 5.9 percent, then 4.9 percent the 
year after, and 3.9 percent the year after 
that. By the 2025–26 school 
year, the starting salary will 
be $51,421, compared to 
the current starting salary 
of $45,457. It’s an overdue 
improvement, but it might 
still not be enough.


“Teachers are the most 
unappreciated and under­
compensated [workers],” said Boroski. 
What’s more, New Haven teachers 
advocate for their students far beyond 
the classroom. Comulada recounted two 
trips to Massachusetts that she orga­
nized in 2019, rallying students and fel­
low teachers to support a student who 
had been detained by ICE.


Students 
leave 
Augusta 
Lewis 
Troup at 2:50 p.m.. Under the hum of 
fluorescent lights, Jett stows the mark­
ers and crayons, sorts early-reader books 
and chapter books into their separate 
bins, and reorganizes math manipula­
tives. He keeps the supplies his paycheck 
paid for in good shape. A mile away at 
the Cooperative Arts and Humanities 
High school, Boroski and Wetmore do 
their ritual clean-up as well: Wetmore 
puts away all of her art supplies so that 
a health teacher can use the room the 
following morning, while Boroski rolls 
up the projector screen that he bought
for his room. ∎
