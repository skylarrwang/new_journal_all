EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“consistent” presences are passersby, like 
visiting alums, students’ families, and 
tourists. And are New Haven locals also 
included in Graduate New Haven’s com­
munity, even without a reason to ever 
spend the night there?

I wondered what it meant for some­
one—for an artist—to be tied to a hotel 
community, anyway. 

In any case, Geo had solid enough 
ties to the Graduate community as 
someone living in New Haven, a student 
attending Yale, or a guy who regularly vis­
its the lobby to do work. Maybe a mix of 
everything. Looking at what had clearly 
been months of work in the studio—
the many careful knots of rope keeping 
his sculpture together—Geo proved 
himself well. Whether it be within the 
Graduate or Sweet Dreams or really 
any other community, I think Geo does 
have the ability to tether himself wher­
ever he’d like, if that was what he wanted. 
My question lies in how tight this tie 
to the Graduate community was and 
would continue to be, and what exactly
it looked like from both sides of the rope.

The backgrounds of the rest of Geo’s 
cohort continue to reveal how much 
more pliable the criteria of community 
can get. Already an upperclassman on 
academic leave, Geo’s the youngest res­
ident of the eight-member Summer ‘22 
cohort by about four or five years. He 
is this cohort’s only college student. 
Geographically speaking, the rest of the 
2022 cohort is a mix of bona fide locals, 
alumni of host towns’ associated schools, 
and total newcomers. As a whole, the 
Graduate and the Society’s community 
ties tangle into a knot. 

To be fair, the Sweet Dreams Society 
is still young. At the time of writing, it 
has recently opened the application for 
its Winter 2023 residency, which will 
be its third cohort of artists. Maybe the 
Society’s obscurity, both in reputation 
and logistics, is reasonably unintentional. 
But I still find this interesting with a fig­
ure like DJ White Shadow in charge. 
Then again, “We are all students,” 
said the tagline. The Society could still 
be learning how to emerge, too. 

Talking to DJ White Shadow is like 
talking to a quirky uncle. 
Though we were on a phone call 
between New Haven and Paris, I could 
almost hear the expressions he made as 
he spoke, the way his hands might’ve 
been waving around when he called peo­
ple he didn’t name directly “boneheads,” 
“total turds (to be frank),” and “full of 
shit.” Incredibly nice guy, though. 

“We’re trying to build something 
that’s emotional. Like, for lack of a bet­
ter word, very loving and tied to our 
surroundings.” He went on, “The basic 
ethos of the Sweet Dreams Society is 
that hotels are in the community, the 
hotel has space, and all the space in the 
hotel should be used—preferably for 
good rather than evil.” 

Paul laughed as he said this. 

It turns out, his tie to the Graduate 
community is a simple one: he’s been 
friends with the owner for about twenty 
years. And so he chose Graduate’s spaces 
for good because they both shared the 
idea that a hotel should serve the com­
munity it’s in. It was an easy choice to 
make. Paul’s goal with the Sweet Dreams 
Society, then, was to serve Graduate 
communities with spaces that their com­
munity members could create in. That 
is, with a private hotel chain’s private 
studios, which were often discovered by 
chance or word-of-mouth. 

Logistically, the Graduate makes 
perfect sense as the home of the Sweet 
Dreams Society. But in practice, at least 
in the practice of its marketing and pre­
sentation, I’m still unsure what to make 
of it. I remember, in particular, when 
Geo told me about friends who had 
passed by the Graduate without ever 
knowing he was working in a studio in 
the back—“You’re telling me you’ve been 
there? Every day, ten hours a day for the 
last four months, and we have never
been inside?”


The studios are for their communi­
ties. Their Graduate communities, spe­
cifically. But before anyone else, the keys 
belong to the artists. I had asked Geo 
if his time working in the studio felt 
influenced by Yale, perhaps the most 
present Graduate New Haven-related 
community sitting outside those doors. 
He shook his head no. 

“This is my space,” he’d said, looking 
over his projects and furniture and scraps 
of rope. He smiled. 

I am still unsure of what kind of 
artist community the Sweet Dreams 
Society aims to build from the already 
loose bounds of what makes the 
Graduate community. What would actu­
ally emerge if you combined, into one 
communal space, all ten of these isolated 
and far flung studios, the three to four 
months of personalized work from each 
artist, and the depth that would come 
with each of their solo exhibitions? 

I don’t doubt that Paul is making an 
honest effort. I’ve heard from Geo, and 
three other Sweet Dreams members, 
what a valuable time their residency has 
been in terms of their art, having a space 
of their own, and the validation of work­
ing with people at similar stages in their 
careers. 

“We have a lot of interactive fabric 
between the artists, and we encourage 
them to get to know each other. I try to 
put people in the same room, put them 
on the same call, put them in the same 
position,” Paul explained to me, “so they 
know, you know, you’re not the only 
weirdo in the world.”

A 
week and a half after Geo’s exhibi­
tion was the Sweet Dreams Society’s 
collective artist showcase. All eight of 
the Society’s 2022 cohort would finally 
convene in New York City, in Graduate 
Roosevelt Island’s Panorama Room. This 
was where I began to realize that maybe 
the Sweet Dreams Society and its collec­
tive identity, at large, aren’t supposed to 
make much sense. But I wanted to try to 
understand it anyway. 

The Society’s little gold plaque was 
almost as hard to find in the Roosevelt 
Island hotel as it was in New Haven—
behind the receptionist’s island counter 
in a small cubby of a hallway. But that 
night, the studio doors stayed shut. I 
walked just a bit further to the elevator, 
blocked off by velvet rope and a pair of 
security guards. I showed them my ID 
and they allowed me to ascend to the top 
floor. The elevator opened to more velvet 
rope and two people with a list, taking 
names by the door. 

I stepped into a rooftop bar. Geo’s 
work was the first thing I saw, but just a 
portion of what had been on display in 
New Haven: his three Riso prints on a 
small table and his AI Scout Badges, pro­
jected on the floor nearby. Right behind 
the projections was DJ White Shadow 
himself, working a DJ set from an ele­
vated booth. Despite the crowded bus­
tle of the bar and the music that was so 
loud that you had to yell if you wanted to 
talk with someone, he was cool, focused, 
and remarkably unnoticeable—I never 
would’ve guessed that he was the 
founder of all this. 

The rest of the showcase had been 
set up in a long, narrow lounge annexed 
from the rest of the bar. There, about 
three to four paintings from four dif­
ferent artists were intimately packed 
together, flanking both sides of me as 
I walked down to look. Still wearing 
my puffer coat from outside, I tried not 
to bump into the easels as I passed by 
(but this would happen anyway, multi­
ple times). Between these artists’ works, 
there was actually a fine amount of 
room. Just not enough to get the full 
picture of what they’d really done for 
all those months over the summer—
not unless you put in the effort to find
a closer look. 

Here were the artists of the Sweet 
Dreams Society, finally all together in 
this communal and surely bonding cel­
ebratory experience. But what seemed 
to have happened when they were put 
all together, at least to me, was that their 
community was too tightly-woven and 
too distant all at once; it was incredible 
to see all the different things they’d put 
together under the same mentor and 
in the same chain of hotels, from fiber 
installations to paintings to huge papier-
mâché sculptures, but each had taken a 
little of the focus away from its neigh­
bors, especially due to the hotel bar’s lack 
of dedicated space for the show. I saw 
a lot of the Sweet Dreams Society’s art, 
but I didn’t know how much I could see 
of the artists themselves. 

Everything from that entire sum­
mer of working away in privacy was 
finally out in the open. But as I sat in 
that little lounge, surrounded now by 
guests who seemed like they mostly 
came for the charcuterie board, their 
complimentary drinks from the bar 
in hand, I wondered what all of this 
was really for. The celebration of the 
work, or the act of the party? Maybe 
I wasn’t tied closely enough to their
community to know. 

The fifth display, at the end of the 
lounge, had a little more room and 
was intended to be an experience. Yen 
Azzaro’s ALTAR|ALTER is based on 
the Buddhist shrine of her childhood 
home. But rather than gifts for the spir­
its, Azzaro’s altar was filled with items 
related to survivors and victims of anti-
Asian hate crimes—a chunk of concrete, 
a knife, a target bag, a bottle of massage 
oil. There was also a bundle of incense 
for observers to “pray” with and leave in a 
bowl of rice. I grew up Buddhist too, and 
I thought this was beautiful. 

Azzaro couldn’t ship the original 
“altar” from Michigan, so what sat in 
front of me was a small table from the 
outside lounge, with some of the items 
on its surface while others were rele­
gated to the floor. Alongside those were 
vinyl signs with instructions on how to 
approach the exhibit.
