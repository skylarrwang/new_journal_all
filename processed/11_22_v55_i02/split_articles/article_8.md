**Those Who Stay**

It’s not easy to make 
the choice to stay.

New Haven Public School teachers are leaving 
for nearby districts with higher wages.

I
t’s 8:35 on a weekday morning, and 
students are filing into the Augusta 
Lewis Troup school in New Haven. 
Visible through the glass face of the 
building, clusters of middle-schoolers 
chat unhurriedly. Backpacked students 
bottleneck at the school’s front doors 
and spill out onto the wide stretch of 
pavement outside.

Sixth-grade teacher Da’Jhon Jett has 
been preparing in his classroom since 7:15 
this morning. Today, his three gifted and 
talented students—students who read 
well above a sixth-grade level—might 
finish independent work early. Jett hopes 
that they’ll use the advanced books, pur­
chased with his own money, to occupy 
themselves while he teaches four of his 
other students to identify the letters of 
the alphabet. Of his twenty-one students, 
four are learning English as a second 
language. Four are working on letter 
identification, and six need more special 
education support than they currently 
receive. Jett is not trained as a teacher of 
special education or English Language
Learners (ELLs). But since Augusta Lewis 
Troup lacks enough specially trained 
educators, these students have landed
in Jett’s classroom.

Low pay and tough working con­
ditions have triggered a mass exo­
dus of teachers from the profession. 
Nationwide, starting teacher salaries 
have sunk to the lowest level since the 
Great Recession (after adjustment for 
inflation). Pay—decided years in advance 
by union contracts—has not kept up 
with the rapid rise in cost of living. Since 
January 2021, rates of resignation have 
grown in educational services faster than 
in any other industry because of low pay 
and overwhelming expectations.

In New Haven, the impact on stu­
dents is especially dire. The city can’t 
compete with the salaries and working 
conditions of other Connecticut districts, 
which benefit from more local property 
tax revenue. Teachers are leaving New 
Haven to fill better-funded vacancies in 
wealthier districts, primarily in Fairfield, 
leaving the teachers who stay to pick 
up the slack. All six of the teachers I 
interviewed for this article 
know people who recently left 
the district.

Ryan Boroski is a Social 
Studies teacher at the Co-
operative Arts & Humanities 
High School. “Two of my 
friends left this year,” he told me. 
“One was going to make 50 per­
cent more and one was going to 
make 35 percent more.”

When some teachers leave, 
class sizes increase for those 
who stay. Steve Baumann, an 
eighth-grade science tea­cher in 
his tenth year at the Conte West 
Hills school in New Haven, 
explained how classroom man­
agement suffers in large classes: 
“If you have twenty-five students 
and you have even three that are really 
off-behavior, it can really throw off the 
dynamic of the whole class.” Jett also 
said that he often feels unable to teach 
effectively with so many students in the 
classroom. Leslie Blatteau, President of 
the New Haven Federation of Teachers 
Local 933, said, “Right now we’re jug­
gling the jobsof many people . . . it wears 
on energy and morale.”

All six of the teachers interviewed 
had classes larger than twenty-five stu­
dents. Eighteen or fewer is generally 
considered ideal.

J
ett, who is Black, began teaching 
because he wanted to show students 
of color that “we can . . . lead in the class­
room.” However, with increasing pres­
sures from the school to cater to students 
with vastly different needs, Jett told me, 
he has little time to get to know his stu­
dents one-on-one.

Before moving to New Haven, Jett 
taught in Hamden, where average profi­
ciencies in math and reading are 43 and 
50 percent, respectively. In New Haven, 
these rates are 22 percent and 35 per­
cent. Jett attributed the discrepancy in 
achievement between New Haven and 
Hamden in large part to overwhelming 
class sizes. This year, Jett was relieved that 
his class only had twenty-one students, 
a decrease from last year’s twenty sev­
en-student class. But he still struggles 
to get everyone on the same page. Of 
the low reading levels among some 
of his students, Jett told me, “I didn’t 
know until I got there. I didn’t believe 
it until I got there. I just didn’t think it
could be that low.”

Though conditions of teaching in 
New Haven—class sizes, low pay, and 
long hours—have induced some teachers 
to leave the district, the six New Haven 
teachers I spoke with are committed 
to helping their New Haven students. 
Teachers cited New Haven’s unique 
diversity and the new union leadership’s 
commitment to improving teaching and 
learning conditions as reasons for staying. 
The New Haven school district is in the 
top one percent in the state for racial and 
ethnic diversity, and 88 percent of its stu­
dents are Black or Latinx.

Blatteau, who has taught social stud­
ies in New Haven since 2007, won her 
election to union president in December 
2021. She ran alongside a slate of candi­
dates that included Wilbur Cross High 
School counselor Mia Comulada as sec­
retary. Before the election, Blatteau and 
her colleagues asked teachers what they 
wanted to change about their jobs. Many 
responded that their “working condi­
tions are students’ learning conditions,”
