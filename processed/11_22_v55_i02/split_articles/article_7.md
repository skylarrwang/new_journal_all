EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
That’s what Julia once called our neighborhood, half-joking.

We sit in the air-conditioned Starbucks
and she says, heaven is a place on Earth,
Starbucks is a place on Earth, 
and I finish her sentence: 
so Heaven is Starbucks. 
Now we’re laughing,
of course ironic about neoliberal bliss 
but there’s a part of us that means it, 
wants to languish in these velvet chairs forever.

Julia recounts to me the story of Job, 
all that was given and taken away by God. 
We talk about her gamer ex-boyfriend 
who is wasting his brief store of potential. 
She ended things and misses him. 
We are both so greedy,
I tell her on the park bench now, 
devouring cold peanut noodles from the to-go container.

We hear an organ from the church service, 
priest’s deep voice, body of wafer, 
blood of wine. We rush to the door and peer in, 
noses pressed to the stained glass, 
anthropologists of this neighborhood and its ambient humidity.

We hold each other’s hands and wait to ascend,
to be let in, knowing we’re Jewish and we’re stoned
and we won’t, we fucking won’t.


**Lachrymose for Chinatown**
**Author: Ella Goldblum**

E. says it looks nothing like it used to—the robustness and the feel of it is gone. We 
walk slowly from block to block glowing under the moonlight and the dripping 
neon silhouettes of storefronts, of provision, and of humanity. It’s been effaced, it’s 
been erased, it’s been eradicated. A small space, already designated for a people, 
sequestered further and further—a nation condensed into a city condensed into a 
town condensed into a district condensed into a small boat rocking endlessly on 
an uneven and cruel ocean, waiting to topple and capsize. Squashed in between a 
trendy French bistro and an upscale ‘dirtbag’ bar is the stall we grab dinner at. The 
aunty firmly places our fried dumplings in a styrofoam box with chopsticks—E. 
tells me that the aunty likes me, but there’s not a hint of kindness in her eyes, how could there 
be? It’s too much to ask someone to be kind when all they’ve known is violence. As we plop the 
steaming jiaozhi in our mouths, E. points out a mural of pigeons playing mahjong. Their feathers 
are bright and multi-colored. How do they hold the tiles? How do wings, tools of migration and 
transit, grab a hold of something in this world? There’s another one across the street of a lion dance, 
the lion’s head swallowing a hongbao as a diverse group of onlookers clap in joy. The lion, a symbol 
of dominion and masculinity in the west, is representative of community here. We bounce from 
mural to mural until it leads into an alleyway. White people are spilling out of a bar into the street, 
their faces are split open in drunken smiles. We’ve stopped in front of a mural of Sun-Wukong, the 
Monkey God. When I was a child, the only way I could even stand to learn Chinese was through 
the tales of his mythical journey. He is faded—his golden fur melted to jaundice and Jingu Bang 
looks small next to the large truck parked next to him. On his face, someone’s pasted a Grateful 
Dead sticker. There’s a slight pause in her body as E. stares, calculating this vandalism. The white 
people are growing wilder, their shouts definitely reaching the tops of shop houses, waking those 
inside trying to sleep. E. reaches up, grabs the edge of the sticker, and violently peels it off, revealing 
his gleaming face and that mischievous grin still smiling . . .
