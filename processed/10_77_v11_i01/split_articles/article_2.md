**Title: Bergman Revisited**

Several years ago to the day, there was a ferocious uproar in New York. Ingmar Bergman's Persona was shown at the New York Filmfestival-comique. The artist was present. I say "artist" for what is he if not a painter, with winter light and glasses darkly as his tools, a choreographer of sleeping and waking, the heroic soporific of modern man. I say "present" in hopes of the reader's understanding indulgence. And this man, this walking symbol of so much that is dark and sleepy on the Northern Side of this globe, was forced, alas, the memory is painful, to wait an entire day before a contract with a distributor was signed, guaranteeing the artist a mere ninety-eight and a half percent of box-office revenues and a two million dollar advance. As the artist in que.stion has said, " I owe more than that in chess debts."


The uproar that greeted his work, had not the sovereign of the city, the von Sydow-like Lindsay, left shortly after the credits, might have lasted a full four seconds. Caused, one has it on good account (that of the critic for Midnight magazine, Lightning Louie) because the foot and bottle fetishists arrived too late for the scene involving the broken glass.


As examples of the diverse yet all together reactions caused by this astonishing work, let me cite the program note. Printed in 9 point Caledonia - alas why not Trump Mediaeval, or even 36 point P.T. Barnum Bold for this artist who has said .. There's one dead every minute"? - it read: 
Another confusing and profound work by one of the heavies ( 185 at last count - putting it on, lngmar baby) of modern Swedish literafilm, it will bore some, confuse others, and cost you $5 for a seat with a view of the screen. Bergman's marriage of light and dark, sex and silence, is one of the most profoundly important since that of Akhenaten and Nefertiti (He had the power. she had the legs) in the Amarna period of Egypt.


Now let me compare my reaction, written after reading the above program note, as a guarantee of impartiality.


Soon after entering the theatre, I felt a gradual sensation of darkness. I realized I was not alone, Others were sensing this too: For Bergman had come up with the astonishing device of dimming the lights before showing the film. Soon after, the film broke. How often had we seen this as mere fakery in the hands of an incompetent projectionist. But here it was being done for real. film burnt as only a supreme Swedish craftsman knows how. Soon thereafter, I encountered the figure of Morpheus, Bergman's substitute for the figure of Death in those films where the latter was unavailable, "having entertained a better offer from Hollywood. I had the most peaceful sensation known to man, a kind of drowsiness. a heaviness of the eyelids so similar to that experienced under hypnosis, a desire upon leaving the theatre to remember nothing.


As a last corrective, confirmative of the similarity of visions induced by the swell Swede, let me quote from Dennis Hopper, an artist of similar stature and talent, whose film Easy Rider. shown at the same Film-festivalcomique was to show once and for all the possibility of combining the figures of the hippie, the biker, the heroine-pusher, and $60,000,000 at the box-office. Hopper's interpretation: 
Well, yea, man, I mean, he blew it man, I mean like you know man, I mean I fell asleep man, can you dig it? I mean Sleeping at a Bergman movie is like a lot easier than trying to fall asleep on your bike man, I mean shit, man.


Ah yes, this artist, who !:las done so much to revolutionize the world's sleeping habits, whose movies have a marvellously spiritual, timeless quality, as if one were dead and never going to wake up - so aptly symbolized by his frequent docks with no hands - that one finds only in the greatest art. I cannot close without c~ting what must be the definitive artist's analysis of his own work, a comment that seems to distill all his message into a few words, "Wo ist G0t? G0t ist t0d, und 0e'm goeng to rna ke l0tsa m0eney 0eff it."
