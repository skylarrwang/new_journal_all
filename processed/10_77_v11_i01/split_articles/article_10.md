blathering on a joint of his $50 a bag 
weed and tried calling his dealer 
friend about it -
he was knocked 
cold while leaning forward to catch 
the last streamer of smoke from the 
roach. "That's it!" he bellowed, the 
small gash above his eye annoying 
him somewhat. "I'm just going to glue 
the fucker down!" and so saying he 
produced the tiny tube and we had a 
grand time gluing objects all over the 
house. 

But this story is not about Krazy 
Glue and the only reason I mentioned 
The Hardware is that I'd never had a 
pushbutton system before and I felt it 
was long overdue. Christ! This is 1977 
and I knew that some cheap piece of 
crap wasn't going to cut it in our 
household. 

But I liked the slabby look of the 
Trimline and the pushbuttons (al-
though not the squared keyboard-type 
I had expected) had a terrific solid-
state look that reeked of efficiency. 
SNETCO seemed to be letting me 
know that if it weren't for geeks like 
Ralph Nader, flapping their wings 
about mindless safety precautions, I'd 
have the relays and switches right up 
front, the bare metal contacts await-
ing my touch. The receiver and 
keyboard were integrated on one unit 
on my new Trimline Totalphone, and 
with a digital dexterity normally 
found only in accordion players one 
could actually manage the whole 
procedure one-handed thereby per-
mitting the simultaneous operation of 
calculators and other electronic equip-
ment indigenous to a typical house-
hold of the computer age. Between 
classes and Star Trek reruns who has 
time to squander? 

The really impressive feature of the 
Totalphone service is that your unit 
looks no different from those used by 
plebes who might as well be talking 
to you from the Bronze Age. The 
hold button feature is enough to 
intimidate these clowns. ("Sorry 
Waldo -
other line") With a quick 
punch of the right index you are 
hooked up to the Mongo Mother 
Computer --,- the Big Ear that 
controls half the world (if ya can't 
beat 'em ... ) and by using all manner 
of codes provided by the SNETCO 
Totalphone info pamphlet you can do 
it all -
from launching a salvo of 
ICBM's to lighting up the Christmas 
tree on the White House lawn. 

The service also allows you to hold 
three-party conference calls and for-
ward calls to another number while 
you're out at the condensers or at 
droid maintenance. 

The most up-to-date feature of the 
T -phone is the speed call. By the deft 
use of one of the extra buttons on the 
keyboard (you know -
the ones with 
the tic-tac-toe board and the Egyptian 
symbol for Ankh) you can program 
the unit to ring up to eight numbers 
(alas, not simultaneously -
a techno-
phile such as myself must simply 
make do) by depressing a single key. 
Of course, one must accept such 
atrophied numeral retention as a 
natural consequence of the con-
venience, but we've done quite well 
over the last two decades without legs 
or digestive systems, so no great 
tragedy. 

Well, I justtapped the number 
seven and the button with the sigma 
notation symbol on it which tells you 
how you're feeling (galvanic skin 
response costs onlv an additional two 
doilars a month) ~nd with a click or 
two more I will have the horoscope 
for today. I am completely pleased 
with Toto -
he screens out annoying 
calls and his reassuring hum is a 
mainstay when I feel I am misunder-
stood by the fallible human world. 

With all of the options available in 
the complete package, I have no need 
for the telephone function, so I'm 
having it disconnected. Toto and I 
have no use for the others.

**Speed Reading at Yale**
**Author: Nick Defeis**

You have 34 seconds to finish 
this article: begin. 
In 1701, old El~m never guessed 
that by 1977, Yali~s \\jOuld need or 
want to learn how to tead, or he 
might have decided to' scrap his 
library and set up a trade school. But 
in the epoch of fast foods and one 
night stands, it was inevitable that 
speed reading would enter the Ivy 
League. 

You must have had one of those 
innocuous yellow flyers from Evelyn 
Wood slipped under your door by 
now. Since they offer no information, 
besides a promise to make you the 
fastest kid on the block (at least as 
far as reading is concerned), the only 
way to find out the true story of 
Evelyn Wood (this sounds like a 
porno flick) is to visit the Holiday 
Inn (maybe this is a porno flick) for a 
free session. 

At the introductory meeting you 
will be quoted a $300 price for seven 
meetings of several hours each. Before 
cashing in your food rebates, you will 
do well to consider a few points 
brought to light by recent Wood 
graduates. 

The most frequently mentioned 
criticism (200 words) of the course is 
that Evelyn Wood offers you nothing 
you couldn't learn yourself. Accord-
ing to one Yale source, "any 
well-written book on speed reading 
offers virtually the same course Wood 
does, at a fraction of the cost. I only 
wish I had known this last year." The 
teachers are not special; after the 
seven week program many partici-
pants felt qualified to teach the 
course. 

Nor is reading speed increased as 
dramatically as the advertisements 
claim. Though satisfaction is guaran-
teed or your money back, proving 
that you have managed not to learn 
anything is difficult. 

reading tests contain such easy pas-
sages and questions -
that only 
the simple-minded could fail to 
improve after learning the rudi-
mentary Wood skills. When reading is 
of a more obscure nature, Evelyn 
Wood offers as little help as your 
class notes. Just try flipping through 
the Principia Mathematica in an hour 
or two. 

Some Woodsies (Old Woods?) even 
claim that Evelyn Wood teaches very 
little reading; hours are spent on such 
extraneous items as notetaking and 
newspaper editing. (We hope that the 
board of the Daily News is reading 
this.) The fact that the course's 
syllabus includes these items indicates 
that Evelyn Wood doesn't have too 
much to teach. 

In the face of these criticisms, there 
are those who hold Evelyn (400 
words) Wood speed reading to be an 
invaluable part of their education. 
Some, like David Kelley, Wood '77, 
claim the $300 fee provides an 
incentive unavailable by purchasing a 
$3.00 "how to" book. Others accede 
to criticisms of the instructors and 
format, but counter these by asserting 
that you do indeed learn a new skill-
more than can be said of many Yale 
offerings at $600 a shot. Reading 
speed is definitely increased (273 
words -
you're losing ground!). 

There may be some loss of compre-
hension, but not nearly as much as in 
"skimming" the material without the 
benefit of speed-reading skills. 

So we are left with a rather faulty 
expose: the course does what it 
claims. I've garnered these opinions 
from people who took the c~urse, 
people who wish they had known all 
of this before plunking down the 
$300. Yet no one wholeheartedly 
regretted their investment, and no one 
was dissatisfied enough to demand a 
refund. Like any other course, speed 
reading involves some work, some 
disappointment, some learning. Look 
at it this way -
after having learned 
absolutely nothing from good old 
Psych I Ia, did you ever try and get 
your money back? 

600 words. It should have taken 
you exactly 34 seconds to read this 
article. Please answer the following 
questions: 
I) When was Yale founded? 
a) 1977 
b) 1701 
c) 344 words ago 
2) The law of excluded middle is 
a) False 
b) None of the above 
c) found in the Principia Mathe-
matica 
d) irrelevant to this article 
3) You learned nothing from Psych Ita 
because 
a) you were dropped on your head 
as a child 
b) you dropped the class after 2 
weeks 
c) you haven't taken speed reading 
d) False -you did learn something 
from Psych II a, and you are 
smarter than the staff of this 
magazine 
4) Old Woods are 
a) somewhere near New Canaan 
b) a brand of Scotch 
c) graduates of a speed-reading 
course

**Mailbox Overflow**
**Author:  Not specified**

When we returned to New Haven 
after a long hot summer (see Friend 
of Infamy, p. 2), we found our 
mailbox overflowing. The following 
items constitute a mere sampling: 
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
From ABC Records: 
With several national AOR sta-
tions, retail outlets and members of 
the press showing a substantially 
increased interest in Tom Petty and 
The Heartbreakers, the group is 
embarking on a series of concert 
dates throughout the West this fall. 
Petty and the Heartbreakers will be 
the opening act for Be Bop Deluxe on 
all six dates. 
Jay Morgenstern, President ABC/ 
Dunhill Music, INC. has recently 
successfully concluded negotiations 
for the acquisition of Lambert and 
Potter's interest in One of A Kind 
Music. 

Included in this prestigious cata-
logue are the Glen Campbell hits, 
"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in 
L.A.)" and "See You On Sunday," 
the score to the motion picture 
"Tunnelvision," Kiki Dee's "Once A 
Fool," Tavares' "It Only Takes A 
Minute," as well as the songs "You 
Brought the Woman Out of Me," 
••Baby Don't Be Giving Me Up," "My 
Ship," and ••stood Brothers" among 
others.

FROM PUFFIN NEWS -
PAPER-
' BACK BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 
FROM PUFFIN: 
Everyone knows what Penguins 
and Pelicans are, but what, exactly, is 
a Puffin? A puffin - like a Pelican -
is a dignified bird with curious habits 
When in flight, the Puffin always 
seems to have a very large head. On 
land, it struts around in an erect pose 
with a contemplative, almost comical 
look. The summer home for millions 
of Puffins is the Westman Islands. 
There are Puffin colonies on thirteen 
of the islands when they take up 
residence in early spring. The Puffin 
lays only one egg each year.

DR. CAMMER'S FREEDOM 
FROM COMPULSION IS 
COMPELLING! 
Do you recognize any of these 
people? 
• The hostess who rushes to empty 
the ash tray as soon as the cigarette 
butt appears in it ... 
• The excessively tidy-clean man who 
avoids sitting down at a party because 
he refuses to crease his trousers or 
jacket 
• The list maker so much in 
obeisance to his list that if asked to 
take off for a movie he answers with 
a vacant gaze because this is not on 
the list (Ed. see Friend of Infamy, p. 
2. paragraph I)

Dear Lori, 
Since the first weeks of school 
promise to be wild and wooly, I 
wonder if we should begin to make 
plans for the first issue of The New

interesting class .....
