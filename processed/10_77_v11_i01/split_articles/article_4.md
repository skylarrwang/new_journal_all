The Hanna Gray Story 
When for the umpteenth time, the 
Yale Daily News ran that photograph 
of Hanna Gray standing, arms folded, 
looking cross, word was sent to 
Woodbridge Hall that it would be 
nice for the News -
and for Mrs. 
Gray -
to obtain a new picture. A 
photographer went over for a shutter 
session and Gray -
who reportedly 
hates to have her picture taken 
because none will do her justice -
did not show up. The editors then 
sent the photographer to follow her 
around in public. He did -
for an 
hour -
but Mrs. Gray never un-
folded her arms long enough for the 
photographer to take a different 
picture. 

As Yale enters the flfth month of 
interregnum, with Provost Hanna 
Gray as Acting President, the para-
dox that surrounds her administration 
can be deflned more clearly. Unlike 
the charismatic politician who is 
loved by those who don't know him 
and an anathema to those who do, 
Hanna Gray is well liked by her staff. 
Beyond what may only be a veneer of 
unapproa~hability, they report that 
she has an incisive sense of humor. 
Most of them, from Corporation 
members to administrative members 
of the faculty, find her quite ap-
proachable; some say that they enjoy 
working with "Hanna" more than 
they enjoyed working with 
"Kingman." ··with Brewster, you 
never were quite sure what he 
expected of you," said one adminis-
trator who is close to both. "Things 
run much more smoothly." 

With the door closed, the Presi-
dent's Offlce in Woodbridge Hall 
looks like a closet. It is about the size 
of a Yale .College single room -
without the fireplace. For Hanna 
Gray, the space must be quite con-
fining. Her Pffice as Provost -
the 
one which is really hers -
is a large 
conference room in the Hall of 
Graduate Studies. But half of her 
days since May, when Brewster 
resigned to become Ambassador to 
Great Britain, have been spent in this 
offlce. 

Mrs. Gray has kept Brewster's 
small desk which faces the wall. 
Brewster's John F. Kennedy rocker 
sits facing the new couch she has 
installed. The light green curtains are 
hers, too. But the trappings of office, 
the sense of commanding, is just not 
there. These are temporary quarters. 
Bookshelves remain bare, containing 
only that skeleton of Yale histories 
and class books which Mr. Brewster 
did not pack with him. Pictures have 
disappeared; only the hooks remain. 

The administration which is run 
from this offlce is the same one which 
was structured and orchestrated by 
Kingman Brewster, who sat at the 
desk for fourteen years. And, until a 
new President is appointed, it is 
Gray's determination to keep the 
University on the general course that 
Brewster set. 

"Some people look at this as a 
transition period and see uncertainty," 
says Gray. "Actually, a great many, 
things need doing but the uncertainty 
is not so great. So much of what is 
needed to be done here has always 
been the responsibility of the Uni-
versity as a whole." 

Kingman Brewster was a man who 
spent a great deal of his time on the 
fundraising trail for the Campaign for 
Yale during his last years in office. 
His schedule, which had once in-
cluded a monthly appearance at one 
of the residential colleges, was 
replaced by a schedule which sent him 
instead to breakfasts with alumni 
groups in Atlanta and dinner the 
same day in New Haven. Brewster 
was also a much sought-after spokes-
man for t,he fate of higher education. 

How much to fill these shoes, in 
the midst of a presidential search that 
may well replace her, is Hanna Gray's 
dilemma. The day-to-day duties she 
sees as simply ••an expanded Provost-
ship." 

"There is a big difference between 
being a President and being an acting 
President," says Stanley Flink, direc-
tor of Alumni Communications and 
Public Information. "Mrs. Gray can 
be a very strong management flgure 
without having to worry about the 
range of public activities which are a 
President's responsibility." 

Mrs. Gray demonstrated her talent 
for "strong internal management" 
with her handling of the strike. Union 
officials who gambled that holding off 
a · strike until the school year began 
would wreak havoc on Gray's ad-
ministration have lost. Yale holds 
firm to their predetermined contract 
offers, and .Deputy Provost George 
Langdon and Associate Provost 
Radley Daly have been assigned to 
coordinate the University's response 
among non-striking personnel. 

The long term work of developing 
solutions to Yale's financial crisis 
continues as usual. Last Friday, when 
the· second rebate checks were paid to 
students, negotiations remained at an 
impasse. Mrs. Gray flew off to 
California for a meeting of the Center 
for Advanced Study on Behavioral 
Sciences and a Sunday brunch with 
West Coast volunteers for the Cam-
paign for Yille. 

Vincent Sirabella, business 
manager for AFL-CIO Local 35, the 
Yale unit on strike, is not above 
charges of political ambition himself 
in questions of what motivated the 
job action. Yet he sees the plain 
pattern in Mrs. Gray's actions. 

"I have it from very reliable 
sources," said Sirabella the day before 
the strike began, .. that Hanna Gray 
has been told she can be the President 
of Yale if she does three things. First, 
fix Yale's deficit. Second, make the 
Campaign for Yale a success. And 
third, break my union." 

"That is, of course, absurd," re-
sponded Gray later. She has heard 
charges of the sort before. 

"There is always the sense that 
what is done or not done by an 
Acting President will be seen as a sign 
of ideas of ambitions," continued the 
Acting President. "It's inevitable, and 
you sort of have to live with the fact. 
That level of discourse is not very 
helpful at all." 

Whether Gray wants to be Presi-
dent of Yale- though most people 
assume she does -
is something she 
keeps to herself. Anything she does to 
change the way she -
or Yale -
does things can bring additional 
the new journal, October 20, 1977 
painful charges that her actions are 
motivated by ambition. So she lives 
with a "damned if you do, damned if 
you don't" situation, maintaining a 
low profile. Her speaking engage-
ments are kept at a minimum. Mrs. 
Gray's public posture is only to 
participate in those parts of the 
traditional role of the Presidency that 
are inescapable. "She has not had to 
be involved, as Mr. Brewster was, in 
performing the role of spokesman for 
higher education for Yale and the 
independent colleges," says Flink. 

"She is not the President," said one 
supporter, in reaction to criticism that 
Gray's administration is necessarily 
static ... Everyone expects her to act 
like the President. It's anguish. You 
have to act it, but you're not it., 

Other administrators report that 
the Presidential search has had a 
decided effect on the number of new 
policy matters brought up by Ad-
ministration members. They claim 
that Gray will not implement or 
develop new policy which could 
co~ct with the goals of a new 
President. "To stop an idea halfway 
through is worse than not starting it 
at all," says University Secretary 
Chauncey ... But there's no point in 
not going ahead with plans for 
projects in certain areas. After a 
President is selected, we'll be ready." 

Gray continues her administration 
"on a tough tightrope,, .. on one 
corner of the stage in the spotlight," 
or "with bullets constantly whizzing 
by her bead," depending on which 
metaphor of which University offlcial 
suits you. Substantive policy changes, 
except those budgetary decisions 
which are the prerogative of the 
Provost or initiated by the Corpora-
tion, will wait on the Search Com-
mittee's decision. And, as another 
campus likely candidate for the job 
put it, "I know she and I both hope 
the committee comes to a decision 
within a month or two.,

Hanna Holborn was four years old 
when she first came to Yale. The year 
was 1934; her parents were among the 
first of the academics who came from 
Germany to escape the Nazis. Her 
father, Hajo Holborn, joined the Yale 
faculty in European History. A 
Sterling Professor here until his death 
in 1969, Holborn's entry in Who's 
Who is, for the time being, longer 
than his daughter's. 

One evening a few weeks ago, 
Gray's position as Acting President of 
Yale put her on the dais of the kick-
off dinner for the New Haven area 
United Way Campaign. Also at the 
head table was Vincent Sirabella. As 
Mrs. Gray was introduced to the 
audience as a life-long New Havenite 
who had attended the Foote School, 
an observer saw Sirabella's jaw drop 
in amazement. "Here was Sirabella 
who thought Hanna Gray came from 
outer space somewhere. He had never 
heard that she went to the same 
school his daughter does now. •• 

The New Haven of Hanna Gray's 
childhood was one of an elm-lined 
Hillhouse A venue with a mansion, 
rather than a tower, at the end. 
Science Hill was called Sachem Hill. 
"That's where we went sliding and 
learned to cross-country ski," remem-
bers Gray. She continues to ski today 
as often as possible, with her husband 
at their house in Vermont. 

At the precocious age of 15 Hanna 
Holborn entered Bryn Mawr College. 
Her prime extracurricular activity was 
the Bryn Mawr College News. "We 
were not very kind to the Adminis-
tration," says Gray with a laugh. 
''Bryn Mawr did not have a Phi 
Beta Kappa chapter. We led a 
campaign against bringing it on 
campus. Our motives were part 
snobbery, part populism. The snob-
bery was the feeling that surely 
everybody at Bryn Mawr rated Phi 
Beta Kappa, so why have it at all. 
The other reason was that we thought 
the curriculum was too rough, and 
none of us would make it." 

Almost as soon as Gray became a 
giaduate student at Radcliffe, she was 
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. "By then 
I'd grown up," said Gray. "I was-a 
little embarrassed about my previous 
history." 

After her college journalism experi-
ence, Gray told the New York Times 
last year that she hoped to find a 
glamorous New York publishing 
career. Somehow though, the family 
tradition of scholarship prevailed. 
Gray was a Fulbright Scholar at 
Oxford from 1950 to 1952, and 
received her history Ph.D. from 
Radcliffe in 1957. In 1954 she married 
Charles Montgomery Gray, also a 
career educator, who is now Senior 
Research Associate at the Yale Law 
School. 

For seven years after receiving her 
doctorate, Gray took junior faculty 
teaching posts at Bryn Mawr, 
Harvard, and the University of 
Chicago. Tenure came at the Uni-
versity of Chicago in 1964, where she 
continued her work in general 
European history, with a concentra-
tion in the intellectual development of 
the Renaissance and Reformation. 

Sooner or later most modern 
scholars have to choose between 
academics and administration; Gray 
took the fateful step in I 972 when she 
was named Dean of the College of 
Arts and Sciences at Northwestern 
University. Just a year before, Gray 
had been elected a successor trustee 
of the Yale Corporation and was one 
of the fmt two women in Yale history 
to serve as a trustee. 

"The post at Northwestern was 
particularly interesting," notes the 
Dean, who left the job to come to 
Yale as Provost. "The time was right 
to go into administration. It's an 
extension of my interests." 

It was then up to Kingman 
Brewster, who was seeking to flll the 
Provost's job vacated by now Under-
secretary of State for Economic 
Affairs, Richard Cooper. Sources say 
that Brewster was looking for a 
woman. The person he found, the 
person who assumed his duties as 
Acting President last spring, was 
Hanna Gray. It was late 1974, and 
the budget problems of the expansive 
Brewster years had just come home to 
roost. 

Iri the peaceful mornings, before 
the cars outside have turned Hill-
house. A venue from a quiet residential 
street to a linear parking lot, Mrs. 
Charles Montgomery Gray is a 
gardener. The Provost's House, right 
next to the Secretary's House and two 
doors down from the President's 
House, has a sunporch. Mrs. Gray 
has turned it into a greenhouse. Every 
day, at about half past eight, the 
plants are watered and pruned. By 
nine or nine-thirty she is gone. 

Whether her first stop is the 
President's Office in Woodbridge Hall 
or the Provost's Office in HGS is 
determined by the events of the day. 
Her schedule is precise to the point 
that time is equally divided between 
the two offices. For the most part, 
her day is broken up into half hour 
segments. Meetings with her staff, 
other Corporation officers, and mem-
bers of the Provost's Office are 
frequent and expeditious. 

"We all know that we should work 
a little harder and a little longer 
before we go into meetings with her," 
said Associate Provost for Personnel 
Rad Daly. "I have a sense that I want 
to come into meetings with all the 
homework done." 

"People who work with her know 
they need to have something to say, 
and that they better say it clearly," 
says Gregory Campbell, an Assistant 
to the Acting President who was a 
junior colleague with Gray in the 
University of Chicago's European 
History Department. "You couldn't 
run a discussion group or a seminar 
without doing that either." 

The academic feeling around her 
prevails. Some people who have 
talked to her feel that she "suffers 
fools badly;" officials around her 
confirm she is demanding -
to a 
point. 

"She hates to be interrupted," 
observed one Corporation officer. 
"She'll just go right on talking. But 
I've never seen her_ interrupt anyone 
else either. 

"It is especially funny to see 
someone who has a point to make 
which has to be made immediately. 
She'll just ignore them until she is 
finished." 

"It's not that opposition is not 
allowed," says Campbell. "The ques-
tion is whether the point is of worth. 
A discussion will continue as long as 
there's substance." 

"But she tries to warm up a 
meeting fmt," says one Provost 
officer. "During the playoffs we might 
discuss the relative merits of the 
Yankees and the Red Sox," adds 
Campbell. "She's a Yankee fan." 

Lunches are usually working affairs 
held in the Officers Dining Room 
above Commons or at Mory's. 
During long meetings at the Provost's 
office around a conference table 
sandwiches will be brought in.

"The President's Office in Woodbridge is about the size of a Yale 
College single room- without the fireplace. For Hanna Gray, the 
space must be quite confining." 
"At an Officers' lunch she's usually 
the leader in spoofing somebody," 
notes Chauncey. "And usually it's the 
Secretary -
me." 

On the day the strike began, retired 
Associate Secretary George Vaill 
asked in jest if he should join a picket 
line. "No, George," replied Gray, "but 
you could go home ·and make us 
some cookies." 

During the first week of school, a 
member of the German Department 
of Yale University received an 
engraved invitation to a reception at 
43 Hillhouse.Avenue. But the card 
puzzled him. "Mr. and Mrs. Charles 
M. Gray request the honor of your 
presence at a reception," read the 
card. He took the invitation home to 
his wife. "Do you know any Charles 
Gray?" asked the professor. She 
didn't either. Finally they figured it 
out. 

Last week the Grays gave another 
party unlike anything ever seen at the 
Brewsters. People said later, "Gee, 
wasn't that fun." And at the receiving 
line for the freshmen the Grays didn't 
want to have a student introducing 
them. Informality reigned; there's 
something less royal on Hillhouse 
too. 

As Acting President, Hanna Gray 
Jacks authority to rearrange Yale's 
priorities. However, she can and is 
preparing the way for the financial 
pruning which must be the first task 
of a permanent President. 

The most important policy objec-
tive for the interim administration is 
to devise a process of budgeting 
which will prevent Yale from again . 
acquiring huge unforeseen deficits. 
This year a controllable, anticipated 
$800,000 budget overrun turned into 
a whopping deficit of $6 million. 

Two major reports will emerge 
from the administration in the coming 
year; both will have important conse-
quences for the way Yale raises and 
spends money. On the immediate 
horizon is the work of Anthony 
Knerr, a new Gray appointee who is 
Special Assistant to the President for 
Budget and Planning. His report will 
be released in November,' and from 
then on Yale's funds will be spent 
through "programmed budgeting." 

Not unlike Carter's "zero-base" ap-
proach, the change will put the total 
cost of each Yale program into one 
budget column. 

Knowing the "real cost" of each 
program will help administrators to 
relegate priorities. Hence, it will be 
easier to "trade off," and shift one use 
of resources to another: 

"The system will improve our 
.ability to control budgets so that 
people can be held accountable," says 
Associate Provost Daly. "It will be 
able to send up warning signals 
throughout the year if things aren't 
going right." 

And in the long run, when aca-
demic goals meet with budgetary 
realities, programmed budgets will 
mean a big difference. Bluntly, the 
object is cuts. "It's a problem of 
defining our weaknesses when we 
want to eliminate them to build our 
strengths," concludes one planning 
official. 

Due to the recent extension of the 
Campaign for Yale until next June, 
Corporation Officer for Institutional 
Development Charles Lord has more 
time to consider a replacement pro-
gram which will continue to seek 
capital for Yale's endowment. Until 
the Campaign for Yale, endowment 
funds were raised on an "as needed" 
basis; from now on there is little 
indication that Yale's thirst for more 
endowment will ever be satiated. 

Lord should be reporting directly 
to the Corporation on this issue 
sometime next year. His final formu-
lation, though, surely awaits the 
arrival of a permanent President. 

"We are surely going to need a 
continuing development effort," says 
Gray. "It will be a separate office 
concerned with maintaining a con-
tinued relationship with other kinds 
of donors." 

The "other donors" Gray seeks are 
in addition to "Yale's own" who are 
solicited by the Alumni Fund. It takes 
more than old school ties to win 
funds from corporations and founda-
tions. 

"This is something we've learned 
from the Campaign," says Gray.
