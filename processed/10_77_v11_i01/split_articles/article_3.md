I wasn't particularly psyched on the Totalphone at first - it looked a little too lightweight and I wondered if its base would have to be glued to the night table like that ridiculous Princess phone we had for about a month. Until Dave came by with that great Mohaccan and the tube of miracle adhesive you had to pretend you were Yehudi Menuhin as you pinched the receiver between clavicle and chin while holding down the base with one hand and dialing with the other. Elsewise the loaded spring effect of the stretched receiver cord was likely to snap the glow-in-the-dark bedialed base into your temple like the backfiring slingshots that Wile E. Coyote was creamed with while trying to catch the Roadrunner. Dave had gotten us all completely (continued on page fifteen)


**Title: FRIEND OF INFAMY**
**Author: Saratoga Summers**

An insinuatins hello to everyone at the end of this long, hot summer - a scorcher IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, though on some evenings I SWEAR that the only people seeing any action had to be those deliciously daring looters in the South Bronx and points beyond. It was a long summer, but the people who managed to make it endless are those few Yalies still abroad in Turkish prisons. (I suppose you naughties are going to say you thought it was baby powder!) Console yourself, kiddies (if this column isn't just censored to RIBBONS by those tempestuous Turks!), at least you don't have to buy a rooming contract this year - or for another seven years, at least!!


Aside from the course offerings, though, you jailbirds are missing a lot! (Not to worry; Saratoga ALWAYS has the scoop ... )


The ides of October find your intrepid reporter in a real snit after a terrifying ordeal that is, to my mind, simply STRAW FOR THE FIRE that we more attractive Yalies are building to roast our lecherous, lascivious, licentious instructors. I am referring, of course, to the Yale Sex Suit. Oppressed ladies of the campus, FORWARD MARCH! I was taking an Astronomy class, to learn the many uses of the telescope, but little did I know that such knowledge would come AT THE EXPENSE OF MY BODY AND GOOD NAME!


My teacher wanted me to take my sunglasses off! He SAID that this was so I could see clearly through the telescope, but I understood his hidden meaning. (Who EVER wears sunglasses to bed?) I dropped the course like a hot rock, but now I'm having trouble with my piano instructor. He's always asking me to PLAY! I'm warning you, boys, Saratoga understands a double entendre. The women of this campus have HAD it! Hang 'em high, girls!


••• ITEM ••• What pert POR post-deb is ripe and ready to dump her amorous, unglamorous boyfriend in a pot of bubbling chickenfat just to watch his skin fry? Yes, this certain bovine Bavarian we know is sick unto death of the .. carnal act," that certain "relation" which some know by names that no decent columnists can get their editors to print. She is .. ill unto tbe grave" of ess-ee-ex night and day, day and night, day in, day out, in, out, in, out! It's disgusting. I almost threw up in the keyhole. This is to a certain fellow whose name will appear in this column if he doesn't learn to sheath his sedulous spear about three times in four. THIS IS THE HUMAN RACE, BUDDY.


•••SHORTIES •••To that couple two rows ahead at .. Casablanca": there ARE bras without those damn hooks, you know ... in case you missed that trunkload of hash from Afghanistan, get your hands on the Lebanese stuff. It at least makes you forget how many pages you have to write, if not what courses you're taking! ... warning to Bloomsbury: you don't stop screaming your head off at Rudy's, I'll let the rest of the campus in on it. Just try me ... you don't fool around with Saratoga. I see you when you're sleeping, I know when you're awake, and I have nude photos of all of you. After all, as the great philosopher Socrates once said, "the unexamined life is not worth living." And as the great philosopher Spinoza once said, "If you hear any hot ones, pass them my way!"


Farewell, dear readers; until our next pow-wow, I wish most of you love and peace. I wish some of you unmitigated misery. You know who you are.
