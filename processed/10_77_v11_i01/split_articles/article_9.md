Although he has been in love with 
and apparently made love to Judith 
Hastings, the attractive Radcliffe 
overachiever, Francis now rebuffs her 
amorous advances. Once he explains 
that he has developed a crush on a 
Harvard sophomore (male), Judith 
quickly recognizes her brother Randy 
as the object of Francis' affections. 
When this threesome is left alone 
onstage, the play often threatens to 
become serious; but the hilarious 
inanities of Herschel and the older 
generation diffuse the tensions of the 
central situation. Staged asthma 
attacks, threatened suicides, and slap-
stick pratfalls combine with 
Innaurato's lively and witty dialogue 
to turn a potential sexual nightmare 
into a rambunctious farce. 

Unfortunately, verbal pyrotechnics 
and stage stunts also obscure the 
forward action of the play. John 
Gielgud once noted, in connection 
with his production of The Impor-
tance of Being Earnest, that it is 
important for a director to learn how 
to prevent the audience from laughing 
in too many places. Innaurato and 
Peter Mark Scrufter, the director of 
Gemini, must share the blame for 
allowing the play to become more 
about the personalities and past 
histories of the older people than 
about the present frustrations faced 
by the youngsters. Danny Aiello, as 
Fran, Ann DeSalvo, as his mistress, 
and Jessica James, as the blowzy 
nextdoor neighbor, turn in the 
strongest performances of this pro-
duction and in doing so throw the 
play off balance. Despite the fact that 
the play centers on the figure of 
Francis, the character is underwritten 
by lnnaurato and underplayed by 
Robert Picardo. Each of the older 
characters gets at least one Benno-like 
aria in which he explains how he 
understands himself and his friends. 
The younger generation must do 
without this dramatic luxury. Francis 
moves from brooding to quipping to 
cake-slinging without ever giving us a 
glimpse of how he thinks. Conse-
quently, a few good speeches and a 
lot of good fun hang on a very thin 
plot line. 

And the fun is very good indeed. 
At the end of their first evening in 
town, Judith and Randy are treated 
to a spaghetti dinner on a folding 
table in the backyard. Each character 
approaches his meal differently; the 
emotional entanglements of the day 
have affected appetites in a variety of 
ways. But everyone eats -
except 
Lucille, Fran's widow lady. Lucille is 
not hungry. Lucille will just "pick." 
And pick she does; like one of 
Hitchcock's birds she swoops down 
on everyone else's plate, retrieving 
now some pasta, now a little salad, 
now a piece of bread -
repeatedly 
refusing a plate of her own. Anne 
DeSalvo, who won an Obie for this 
performance (as did Aiello for his), 
plays the scene hilariously but, like 
many other such wacky moments in 
the play, a bravura turn interrupts the 
flow of the action. DeSalvo also 
creates the play's most compassionate 
moment as she lectures Judith on 
homosexuality. Having a son at Yale 
"where they turn out a Jot of queers, 
along with the doctors and lawyers," 
Lucille feels that she can advise the 
younger woman on the love and 
understanding that Francis needs. In 
a somewhat fantastic fashion -
and 
with a great deal of sentimentality -
the older generation appreciates 
Francis' uncomfortable predicament 
even better than Francis or his 
contemporaries. 

The play's ending, like the play 
itself, begs all serious questions. In 
the off-off-Broadway productions 
done at Playwrights Horizons and the 
Performing Arts Foundation Play-
house, Gemini concluded with Francis 
alone at his bedroom window, playing 
Callas as he had at the opening of the 
first act. Judith and Randy having 
departed with minimal hopes for a 
resolution to their dilemma in the fall, 
Francis settled back into discontented 
isolation. In what may have been 
conceived of as a pre-Broadway 
"jollying up," the play now pauses 
where it once ended; after fifty 
seconds of soul searching Francis now 
asks himself that classic question 
posed by every potential heel from a 
boy-gets-girl film comedy: "What am 
I doing?" A few joyful screams to the 
neighbors serve to recall Judy and 
Randy in enough time for Francis to 
join them on their trip back home, 
where our hero presumably will work 
out some solution to his identity 
crisis. Although this is by no means a 
completely happy ending, the hoopla 
that accompanies it drowns out any 
objections that might be raised. Once 
again, the formal demands of comedy 
overwhelm the problems that the play 
raises. 

As its successful run on Broadway 
indicates, audiences certainly find 
Gemini more palatable than Denno 
Blimpie. It is a funny play finely 
acted. But for those of us who have 
enjoyed the broad, grotesque strokes 
of Innaurato's previous work -
including his collaboration with 
Christopher Durang on the Yale 
Rep's Idiots Karamazov 
Gemini 
cannot help but be disappointing. 
lnnaurato has diluted his style, his 
humor, and his subject matter to 
produce a naturalistic, sit-com, 
bisexual-chic hit.

**David Hockney by David Hockney**
**Author: Curt Sanburn**

David Hockney x David Hockney

David Hockney by David Hockney 
Nikos Stangos, editor. 
Harry Abrams, publisher, New York. 
3 I 2 pp., illustrated with 434 illus-
trations, 60 full color plates, $37.50 
The name David Hockney is batted 
about by friends of mine with the 
same exclusive tone of voice used on 
cocaine and lofts. It sounds c.s though 
they've got the corner on something 
vaguely classy, deliciously decadent, 
and impossibly inaccessible to anyone 
else. Well, in fact, David Hockney is 
a very good painter, and the publica-
tion of his autobiography/catalogue 
raisonne, David Hockney by David 
Hockney, should cleanse Mr. 
Hockney of the pop-kitsch-faggot-
media-event image thai his trend 
cultists would have you and me 
believe. 

The text is an edited version of 
twenty-five hours of taped conversa-
tion between Hockney and his editor 
Nikos Stangos. Hockney's rambling, 
loose-weave narrative is informal and 
informative. The tone is pleasantly 
erudite and modest. We hear about 
nearly all of the 434 paintings, 
sketches, and prints included in the 
book, representing the great body of 
his work since 1957. All of this is set 
against a dense background of illus-
trative detail: anecdotal portraits of 
friends, comments on other artists, 
musings on art, and forecasts for the 
future of Hockney's own work. I 
haven't seen as warm and compre-
hensive a view of a living painter 
since Frank O'Hara's monograph on 
Robert Motherwell. 

Hockney's art resists easy classifica-
tion. The artist explains that he was 
"slightly interested in photo-realism," 
but more interested in an "interpre-
tation of the photograph;" he ex-
plores the flatness of objects in a 
photograph and extrapolates from the 
photographic process an original kind 
of figurative modernism in painting. 
The result: Spatial planes that blink 
into color fields and figures that slip 
out of three-dimensional representa-
tion, reappearing as flat signs of 
unusually articulate color. This free 
play between figurative, photographic, 
and color field painting is one of the 
bases of Hockney'-s art -
"eclecticism 
can be a synthesis." The reductive 
thrust of modernism in Hockney's 
work holds the precision of repre-
sentation in a delicate, sophisticated 
balance. 

This is all very ambitious, yet the 
paintings are proof of his success. 
Simplicity and water-like clarity (look 
at the famous pool paintings) belie an 
unfolding complexity of image and 
paint. In "Portrait of an Artist" 
( 1971), a dense and silent work, the 
taut images eventually disintegrate, 
letting their colors float free. It is an 
exhilarating sight. 

If only because of the inaccessibility 
of much of Hockney's work (most of it 
is in private collections; MOMA has a 
single drawing), this book is invaluable. 
places Hockney's art in the public 
domain. It is a comprehensive and 
lively record of a living artist's work 
and life. His prices will probably 
skyrocket as a result, and controversy 
will persist. 

Curt San burn descends from his loft 
to talk about art. 

The British Art Center will be 
exhibiting Hackney's works in 
February, 1978.
