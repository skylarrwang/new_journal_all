In my sweetest dreams, despairing of the grotesque gothic ghouls of Yale, I see the full, lush meadows of Holland painted in the subtlest hues of fresh green, flat but seeming rounded in their abundance, wet with the straight geometric patterns of irrigation ditches, framed by rustic farmhouses, proper and neat modern houses in the distance and the cobblestone road, all of it overhung with that dramatic visualization of God's very own breath, the Dutch sky; af\d this, oh my elusive Elysia, is inhabited by that most splendid of all quadripeds, the Frisian cow.


She is the pure combination of both fundamental colors of the universe, black and white, the dark and unknown of the earth mixing with the wholesome white of milk and other life-related fluids. No shades are allowed in this clearest of colorings except the subtle browns and pinks of her hoofs and the luscious meat colors of her udders, reminding one of the secret and delicious parts of humanity. She is enormous and unmoveable. As a rock she will stand in those soft meadows, slowly flicking her tail as if flies could ever bother her. Gently, she pulls at the grateful grass on which she trods, mixing herself once again with all of nature as her mouth fills with foam and the ground receives the heavy load of what it once was.


Off in the distance, her young issue darts and jumps in the air, defying the gravity of life, laughing with the sun above at the clay underneath their feet. She looks at them, then ( oh, destiny!) at me, her full round eyes echoing Helen's pleas of passion. She bats her eyelashes, too long for a mortal, then bends her hind legs and slowly sinks from her uprightness to the ground. Ah, this vache fatale! Her mouth is contemplating the deliciousness of greenery, the black patches on her body undulate and roll with her gentle breathing. Slowly, she shifts again, folding her front legs underneath her heavy breast. Her udders lie fully exposed, inactive," promising goodness. Slowly, she inclines her head, and I feel as if I could loose my flood of sorrows in her great sea of warmth without ever finding a trace of it back. Then, I wake again, moaning as psychiatrists, doctors and nineteenth-century romantics cluck their tongues at me, impressing the fruitlessness of existence on me. 0 for a cow, a cow to save my sinner's life!
