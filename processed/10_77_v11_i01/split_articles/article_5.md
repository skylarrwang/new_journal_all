Derrida at Yale: "Please Don't Quote" 
by Leslie Anderson 
Jacques Derrida admitted in an 
interview that he is a cautious writer 
and speaker. He asked me not to 
quote him in this article, explaining 
that in view of the care he takes not 
to simplify in a written text, be is 
hesitant to generalize in an interview, 
or have his ideas simplified within a 
quotation. In his writing, he will not 
state his logic outright, though he 
invites the reader to pursue it to its 
radical end. One often feels that his 
conclusions are only implicit, al-
though crucial in understanding and 
evaluating him. If one attacks Derrida 
regarding the inferential quality of his 
writing, be can reply that he never 
said such and such; his caution pays 
off. 

A professor of philosophy at the 
Ecole Normale Superieure, Derrida 
confines his teaching in France to 
philosophical history, but in the 
United States be is known primarily 
as a literary critic of the Post-
Structuralist school. As a guest 
lecturer in the Comparative Literature 
Department at Yale this fall, be gave 
four lectures in French on Heidegger's 
"The Origin of the Work of Art," 
four lectures in French on Freud's 
Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and 
one lecture in English entitled "Ltd., 
Inc." on his own article, "Signature 
Event Context" and "Reiterating the 
Differences: a Reply to Derrida" by 
John R. Searle. 

I asked Derrida why he felt he was 
so controversial. He answered some-
what self-consciously that his type of 
deconstruction destroys the founda-
tion for all the presuppositions of 
Western philosophy, academic insti-
tutions and political beliefs, and 
described his method as a very minute 
questioning into all that forms the 
basis of culture. His essays and 
lectures supply the presuppositions 
and bases that he has in mind. 

Western man assumes that his 
language comes from and points to 
material reality. Science, philosophy, 
and every other discipline consider 
their development part of a pro-
gression towards an absolute, external 
truth. Derrida believes that the 
"truths" man discovers in nature are 
only the assumptions and prejudices 
with which he perceives it. In his 
English lecture, "Ltd., Inc.", Derrida 
used this argument to attack Marx's 
claim that economic principles gave 
rise to th~ superstructure of culture 
and ideas, as well as to his own 
political theory. Derrida noted that, 
like everyone else, Marx had to 
idealize objects in order to talk about 
them: his conclusions simply repro-
duce those ideologies, or in Derrida's 
words, "the axiomatic that belongs to 
the entire philosophy." 

"Derrida's analysis makes no distinction between philosophical, 
literary or scientific texts. He is not interested in finding the meaning 
or 'right interpretation' of a text, but in explaining how, as a text, it 
increases human understanding, and why human understanding 
always involves texts, just as it always involves metaphors." 

Marx tried hopelessly to circum-
vent ideology. Philosophers, obsessed 
by purity, try in t.he same way to 
avoid using metaphors. Within Litera-
ture, one word can have many 
different meanings and several dif-
ferent words can have the same 
meaning. "Sun" is the father of nature 
or the "son" of God. "God," "seed," 
"gold," "sun," "eye," and "Father," 
are interchangeable in certain con-
texts. Philosophers attempting to 
transcend this web of meanings speak 
in an abstract language of "concepts" 
which are meant to be "univocal," or 
free of any metaphorical associations. 
But according to Derrida, every 
concept bas a metaphorical com-
ponent. When someone says "My 
essays are rid of metaphors -
I am a 
pure thinker," or in Marx's words, "I 
am a materialist" he has merely 
resorted to a rhetorical device, 
turning ideology and idolatry into 
. "truth." Man must think through 
. metaphors and, in a larger sense, 
through texts. Metaphors do not 
entrap thought until men enshrine 
them, as they have the Bible, 
Aristotle, Marx, and Freud. In our 
interview, Derrida criticized Marxists 
for treating Marx as though he were 
sacred, and added that he personally 
does not have any sacred texts. 

Professors have embraced the 
language of their disciplines, wrap-
ping themselves up in the security of 
departmental discourse. Derrida 
threatens this security, as a philoso-
pher whose literary criticism is more 
radical and consistent than that of 
literary critics. Derrida's analysis 
makes no distinction between philo-
sophical, literary or scientific texts. 
He is not interested in finding the 
meaning or "right interpretation" of a 
text, but in explaining how, as a text, 
it increases human understanding, 
and why human understanding always 
involves texts, just as it always 
involves metaphors. 

Geoffrey Hartman, a professor of 
English at Yale, feels that Derrida's 
importance lies in his "totally non-
sentimental secularism." He bas 
changed the way many people think 
about literature, encouraging them to 
consider the whole phenomenon of 
literary thinking beyond specific 
works and disturbing the disciplinary 
boundaries of philosophy, literature, 
and science .with his textual approach. 
But he accomplishes this by dis-
regarding the importance of the 
content of the individual work. In 
examining only the rhetorical power 
and devices of a text, he precludes 
any moral judgment about it. 

Perhaps just such a "non-senti-
mental secularism" is the most 
interesting and fruitful way to look at 
literature and philosophy today, but 
is it also, as Derrida suggests, the best 
way to talk about po~tics, scien~ and 
religion? Deconstruction seems 1nade-
quate for studying the Bible, the 
speech of a presidential' candidate, or 
an article on a breakthrough in 
medical research. Derrida bas devel-
oped a critical method that is 
primarily manneristic; it concerns the 
form rather than the content of the 
text. 

Derrida stated in our interview that 
be is trying to change the code of 
political discourse so that some topics 
will be understood as political which 
have never been seen as such before. 
He attacks those who assume that 
philosophy, literature or speech are 
free from anthropomorphism and 
cultural prejudice: value judgments of 
a political nature are implicit in 
language. We are tempted to believe 
that opposites such as simple/com-
plex, light/ dark, presence/absence, 
life/ death represent oppositions in 
nature, that they are impersonal, 
"true," and the basis of defining 
words. Derrida claims that there is no 
such thing as natural opposition. In 
"Signature Event Context" he says 
that opposites are only statements of 
human preference, which arbitrarily 
compare two things. They are "never 
the confrontation of two terms, but a 
hierarchy and the order of a sub-
ordination." We assume that simple is 
better than complex, light better than 
darkness: these judgments have 
shaped the "absolutes" of philosophy 
into expressions of prejudice and 
politics. And, like his literary 
criticism, Derrida's politics are man-
neristic. They deal with definitions: 
analyses of rhetoric taking place after 
the words are spoken and the action 
concluded. His theories are not 
concerned with correcting actual 
problems or enacting people's desires; 
in fact, Derrida's excessive self-
consciousness undermines the values 
and feelings that would generate 
political action. 

The nihilism of Derrida's method 
of analysis becomes Clearer in view of 
the theory of truth that underlies his 
work. Derrida rejects Saussure's 
theory that a word is a sign 
expressing a nonverbal meaning or 
referent, and replies that the con-
nection between language and referent 
or external truth is only arbitrary, 
that our oppositions of meaning come 
from cultural prejudices and do not 
reflect any natural dichotomy. In 
"Signature Event Context," he says 
that "the absence of a referent is a 
possibility easily enough admitted 
today ... the potential presence of 
the referent at the moment it is 
designated does not modify in the 
slightest the structure of the mark, 
which implies that the mark can do 
without the referent." The possibility 
of an absent referent is the basis of all 
speech and writing. According to 
Derrida, human thought and desire 
do not produce speech and, perhaps, 
do not exist. It follows that moral 
outrage and physical hardship do not 
produce political discourse because its 
text may be studied independently of 
the social context. Derrida reverses 
Marx's theory that economic con-
ditions produce the superstructure of 
culture and thought. Rather, the 
superstructure manifests itself in dif-
ferent metaphorical combinations. 

The controversy that surrounds 
Derrida concerns his style of presen-
tation as well as his radical theories. 
His essays have become increasingly 
literary in form over the last ten 
years, substantiating his arguments, 
and seducing the reader with the 
brilliance of his style as well as with 
logic. Many people dislike the com-
plexity with which he writes and 
speaks, and some considered his 
Heidegger lectures self-indulgent; 
others felt that his ideas were not 
worth the trouble it took to grasp 
them through his maze of rhetoric. 
Nevertheless, all of his lectures were 
well-attended, and Derrida expressed 
surprise at the number of American 
students who have adopted his 
~schemas" in their own critical 
method. Derrida himself may be seen 
as a text, and as such, he, too, may 
become a dogma. 

Derrida does not discard the basis 
of Western culture merely to build 
another in its stead: he describes his 
deconstruction as a process that has 
no end. But one wonders at the 
practicability of this aim. As other 
critics take up his method, he may be 
swallowed by the system which he 
attacks. H man always needs meta-
phors and structures with which to 
think, it seems, judging from his 
reception at Yale this fall, that 
Derrida bas become the latest one.
