to the infighting to be tough. But to 
explain away something controver-
sial -
to the faculty, to the alumni -
how would she do it?" 

"On the day the strike began, retired Associate Secretary George Vaill 
asked in jest if he should join a picket line. 'No George; replied Gray, 
'but you could go home and make us some cookies.·" 

Indeed, descriptions of Gray's per-
sonality further make her suited for 
an acting Presidency which is pri-
marily concerned with budgetary 
issues. In her dual role, she acts as a 
"super Provost." 

"Kingman was a pragmatic oppor-
tunist," notes Sam Chauncey, who 
worked with Brewster through his 
entire tenure here. "He saw an idea 
and said, 'Go do it. rm on the 
bandwagon.' Hanna is a logical 
rationalist. She is analytical and 
methodical, like a surgeon." 

And those qualities -
as Chauncey 
and others have defined them -
fit 
the times. The age of austerity at Yale 
would frustrate a dreamer like 
Brewster. These days call for a 
different kind of innovation, of ways 
not to build, but to extricate Yale 
from a fmancial mess. Gray seems 
likely to leave the acting Presidency 
with Yale in a lot better shape than it 
was when she took over. 

Doubts about suitability are also 
apparent, especially within the lower 
echelon which doesn't work with Mrs. 
Gray every day. 

"God, she's hard to talk to. She is. 
I can't get anywhere. You try to have 
a little chit-chat, and you can't get 
through. 

"It's fine when Gray has to make 
the tough decisions; a more gre-
garious person might be too exposed 

This kind of testimony, criticalas 
well as supportive, is the talk which 
goes on in a Presidential search. 
Associates close to Brewster when he 
was an Acting President -
and the 
leading candidate for the permanent 
job -
report it was even tougher. 

As long as Hanna is running the 
house that Kingman built, a com-
parison of her manner with his way 
of running things is proper. It's not 
yet entirely her show. As ever, the 
pressure of the Presidential search 
may have put a damper on the way 
Gray runs things. But the comparison 
between Gray and Brewster is as 
much a product of the times as it is 
of their different personalities. 

One event last year made the 
comparison quite clear. In a televised 
news conference in HGS a smiling 
Kingman Brewster was there to 
announce the appointment of Frank 
Ryan as athletic director. When the 
bright lights went out, though, it was 
Gray's turn. She was the one to tell 
us Yale is entering an age of austerity. 

Does her newness to that office 
upstairs in Woodbridge make it easier 
for Hanna Gray to say "no"? Some 
officials think that with Gray in 
charge, it wiU be easier for Yale to 
balance this year's budget. 

"How could Brewster possibly not 
feel a very strong bond with people 
who went through the late sixties with 
him?" asked one official in response. 

Gray has the chance to make some 
cutbacks where Brewster, with 
political ties for fourteen years, 
couldn•t. "Hard, unemotional, ruth-
less decisions are impossible to make 
which hurt people you've been 
through tough times with," says one 
official. 

But Gray demurs. "I don't think 
that long years of political ties cut 
one way or the other. A person who 
has been here longer might have deb~ 
to call in." 

"So much of the decision making 
depends on process," she notes. 
"Personal or individual considera-
tiohs usually have less of an effect. •• 

But the discussion continues: Gray 
is hardly an outsider. She has been 
here -
and a part of the budget-
making process of the Brewster 
administration -
for almost three 
years. But the types of programs 
which, in the long run, may face 
cutbacks are the things such as 
counseling and decentralized dean•s 
offices, costly academic programs 
which were added during the Brewster 
years. And these are the things which 
would have been harder for Brewster 
to cut than for any of his successors. 

"Hanna keeps reminding people 
that the deficits do not reflect poor 
performance. Yale's overspending has 
not been waste," says Charles Lord. 
"The market didn't stay the way it 
was going. We're no longer willing to 
wait for external events to balance 
our budg"!t." 

"Everybody is for cutting back," 
notes Deputy Provost George 
Langdon. "But every department 
wants things cut far from them. And 
if you start to take away some T A's 
in history, that's an explosive issue 
with the Yale College Council. Some-
where, though, we'll have to give up a 
big piece here or there. •• 

If internally the Administration's 
biggest challenge is to formulate an 
effective budgeting process which wiU 
preclude unforeseen deficits, the 
biggest problem on the outside is 
convincing Yale's constituencies of the 
severity of its problems. 

"It's very, very hard," says Deputy 
Provost George Langdon. "For a long 
time we've lived on the theory that 
bigger is better." 

But Gregory Campbell, Mrs. Gray's 
assistant, contradicts the idea that the 
best way to fix Yale's difficulties is to 
label it as an immediately curable 
crisis. 

"Sliding into a war is the opposite 
of a rational process," said Campbell, 
who is also a European historian. 
" We do not want to make light of 
financial difficulties which are ob-
viously real. On the other hand, we 
do not want to exaggerate like 
Chicken Little. Our policy is just 
consistency, based on rational analy-
sis on a continual basis." 

Perhaps Mrs. Gray has an advan-
tage. Her administration, detached 
from its constituents by the pressures 
of a Presidential search, can begin to 
make some of those hard budgetary 
decisions which ruffle people's 
feathers. Yes, art schools want funds 
cut fairly -
away from their disci-
pline. But the immediate ranking of 
priorities, and making the best of 
Yale's strengths, may require harsh-
ness ... a harshness that Gray can 
handle. These are the budget de-
cisions which must be made in the 


So Hanna Gray is on a tightrope. 
No one knows the effect of any 
Presidential action on Yale's fund-
raising. Alumni who deferred giving 
to the Campaign until Brewster 
resigned can now say they don•t like 
Gray. When a permanent President is 
appointed they can excuse themselves 
by demanding to wait and see what 
the new President's policy is. But 
excuses or not, Yale's uncertain 
financial future -
and its totally 
undefined Presidential future -
will 
be hard on the Campaign. The 
problems of a Presidential search are 
toughest for those campus officials 
whose names are on the list. Public 
discussion of policy demands cer-
tainties. The only certainty of the 
moment is that Yale does not have a 
President.
