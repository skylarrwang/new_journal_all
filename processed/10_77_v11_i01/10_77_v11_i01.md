**Title: pe Pulchridtudinous Vaccinae**
**Author: Jan Kie**
**Page number(s): 2**

In my sweetest dreams, despairing of the grotesque gothic ghouls of Yale, I see the full, lush meadows of Holland painted in the subtlest hues of fresh green, flat but seeming rounded in their abundance, wet with the straight geometric patterns of irrigation ditches, framed by rustic farmhouses, proper and neat modern houses in the distance and the cobblestone road, all of it overhung with that dramatic visualization of God's very own breath, the Dutch sky; af\d this, oh my elusive Elysia, is inhabited by that most splendid of all quadripeds, the Frisian cow.


She is the pure combination of both fundamental colors of the universe, black and white, the dark and unknown of the earth mixing with the wholesome white of milk and other life-related fluids. No shades are allowed in this clearest of colorings except the subtle browns and pinks of her hoofs and the luscious meat colors of her udders, reminding one of the secret and delicious parts of humanity. She is enormous and unmoveable. As a rock she will stand in those soft meadows, slowly flicking her tail as if flies could ever bother her. Gently, she pulls at the grateful grass on which she trods, mixing herself once again with all of nature as her mouth fills with foam and the ground receives the heavy load of what it once was.


Off in the distance, her young issue darts and jumps in the air, defying the gravity of life, laughing with the sun above at the clay underneath their feet. She looks at them, then ( oh, destiny!) at me, her full round eyes echoing Helen's pleas of passion. She bats her eyelashes, too long for a mortal, then bends her hind legs and slowly sinks from her uprightness to the ground. Ah, this vache fatale! Her mouth is contemplating the deliciousness of greenery, the black patches on her body undulate and roll with her gentle breathing. Slowly, she shifts again, folding her front legs underneath her heavy breast. Her udders lie fully exposed, inactive," promising goodness. Slowly, she inclines her head, and I feel as if I could loose my flood of sorrows in her great sea of warmth without ever finding a trace of it back. Then, I wake again, moaning as psychiatrists, doctors and nineteenth-century romantics cluck their tongues at me, impressing the fruitlessness of existence on me. 0 for a cow, a cow to save my sinner's life!


**Title: Bergman Revisited**
**Author: Thomas Russell**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

Several years ago to the day, there was a ferocious uproar in New York. Ingmar Bergman's Persona was shown at the New York Filmfestival-comique. The artist was present. I say "artist" for what is he if not a painter, with winter light and glasses darkly as his tools, a choreographer of sleeping and waking, the heroic soporific of modern man. I say "present" in hopes of the reader's understanding indulgence. And this man, this walking symbol of so much that is dark and sleepy on the Northern Side of this globe, was forced, alas, the memory is painful, to wait an entire day before a contract with a distributor was signed, guaranteeing the artist a mere ninety-eight and a half percent of box-office revenues and a two million dollar advance. As the artist in que.stion has said, " I owe more than that in chess debts."


The uproar that greeted his work, had not the sovereign of the city, the von Sydow-like Lindsay, left shortly after the credits, might have lasted a full four seconds. Caused, one has it on good account (that of the critic for Midnight magazine, Lightning Louie) because the foot and bottle fetishists arrived too late for the scene involving the broken glass.


As examples of the diverse yet all together reactions caused by this astonishing work, let me cite the program note. Printed in 9 point Caledonia - alas why not Trump Mediaeval, or even 36 point P.T. Barnum Bold for this artist who has said .. There's one dead every minute"? - it read: 
Another confusing and profound work by one of the heavies ( 185 at last count - putting it on, lngmar baby) of modern Swedish literafilm, it will bore some, confuse others, and cost you $5 for a seat with a view of the screen. Bergman's marriage of light and dark, sex and silence, is one of the most profoundly important since that of Akhenaten and Nefertiti (He had the power. she had the legs) in the Amarna period of Egypt.


Now let me compare my reaction, written after reading the above program note, as a guarantee of impartiality.


Soon after entering the theatre, I felt a gradual sensation of darkness. I realized I was not alone, Others were sensing this too: For Bergman had come up with the astonishing device of dimming the lights before showing the film. Soon after, the film broke. How often had we seen this as mere fakery in the hands of an incompetent projectionist. But here it was being done for real. film burnt as only a supreme Swedish craftsman knows how. Soon thereafter, I encountered the figure of Morpheus, Bergman's substitute for the figure of Death in those films where the latter was unavailable, "having entertained a better offer from Hollywood. I had the most peaceful sensation known to man, a kind of drowsiness. a heaviness of the eyelids so similar to that experienced under hypnosis, a desire upon leaving the theatre to remember nothing.


As a last corrective, confirmative of the similarity of visions induced by the swell Swede, let me quote from Dennis Hopper, an artist of similar stature and talent, whose film Easy Rider. shown at the same Film-festivalcomique was to show once and for all the possibility of combining the figures of the hippie, the biker, the heroine-pusher, and $60,000,000 at the box-office. Hopper's interpretation: 
Well, yea, man, I mean, he blew it man, I mean like you know man, I mean I fell asleep man, can you dig it? I mean Sleeping at a Bergman movie is like a lot easier than trying to fall asleep on your bike man, I mean shit, man.


Ah yes, this artist, who !:las done so much to revolutionize the world's sleeping habits, whose movies have a marvellously spiritual, timeless quality, as if one were dead and never going to wake up - so aptly symbolized by his frequent docks with no hands - that one finds only in the greatest art. I cannot close without c~ting what must be the definitive artist's analysis of his own work, a comment that seems to distill all his message into a few words, "Wo ist G0t? G0t ist t0d, und 0e'm goeng to rna ke l0tsa m0eney 0eff it."

I wasn't particularly psyched on the Totalphone at first - it looked a little too lightweight and I wondered if its base would have to be glued to the night table like that ridiculous Princess phone we had for about a month. Until Dave came by with that great Mohaccan and the tube of miracle adhesive you had to pretend you were Yehudi Menuhin as you pinched the receiver between clavicle and chin while holding down the base with one hand and dialing with the other. Elsewise the loaded spring effect of the stretched receiver cord was likely to snap the glow-in-the-dark bedialed base into your temple like the backfiring slingshots that Wile E. Coyote was creamed with while trying to catch the Roadrunner. Dave had gotten us all completely (continued on page fifteen)


**Title: FRIEND OF INFAMY**
**Author: Saratoga Summers**

An insinuatins hello to everyone at the end of this long, hot summer - a scorcher IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, though on some evenings I SWEAR that the only people seeing any action had to be those deliciously daring looters in the South Bronx and points beyond. It was a long summer, but the people who managed to make it endless are those few Yalies still abroad in Turkish prisons. (I suppose you naughties are going to say you thought it was baby powder!) Console yourself, kiddies (if this column isn't just censored to RIBBONS by those tempestuous Turks!), at least you don't have to buy a rooming contract this year - or for another seven years, at least!!


Aside from the course offerings, though, you jailbirds are missing a lot! (Not to worry; Saratoga ALWAYS has the scoop ... )


The ides of October find your intrepid reporter in a real snit after a terrifying ordeal that is, to my mind, simply STRAW FOR THE FIRE that we more attractive Yalies are building to roast our lecherous, lascivious, licentious instructors. I am referring, of course, to the Yale Sex Suit. Oppressed ladies of the campus, FORWARD MARCH! I was taking an Astronomy class, to learn the many uses of the telescope, but little did I know that such knowledge would come AT THE EXPENSE OF MY BODY AND GOOD NAME!


My teacher wanted me to take my sunglasses off! He SAID that this was so I could see clearly through the telescope, but I understood his hidden meaning. (Who EVER wears sunglasses to bed?) I dropped the course like a hot rock, but now I'm having trouble with my piano instructor. He's always asking me to PLAY! I'm warning you, boys, Saratoga understands a double entendre. The women of this campus have HAD it! Hang 'em high, girls!


••• ITEM ••• What pert POR post-deb is ripe and ready to dump her amorous, unglamorous boyfriend in a pot of bubbling chickenfat just to watch his skin fry? Yes, this certain bovine Bavarian we know is sick unto death of the .. carnal act," that certain "relation" which some know by names that no decent columnists can get their editors to print. She is .. ill unto tbe grave" of ess-ee-ex night and day, day and night, day in, day out, in, out, in, out! It's disgusting. I almost threw up in the keyhole. This is to a certain fellow whose name will appear in this column if he doesn't learn to sheath his sedulous spear about three times in four. THIS IS THE HUMAN RACE, BUDDY.


•••SHORTIES •••To that couple two rows ahead at .. Casablanca": there ARE bras without those damn hooks, you know ... in case you missed that trunkload of hash from Afghanistan, get your hands on the Lebanese stuff. It at least makes you forget how many pages you have to write, if not what courses you're taking! ... warning to Bloomsbury: you don't stop screaming your head off at Rudy's, I'll let the rest of the campus in on it. Just try me ... you don't fool around with Saratoga. I see you when you're sleeping, I know when you're awake, and I have nude photos of all of you. After all, as the great philosopher Socrates once said, "the unexamined life is not worth living." And as the great philosopher Spinoza once said, "If you hear any hot ones, pass them my way!"


Farewell, dear readers; until our next pow-wow, I wish most of you love and peace. I wish some of you unmitigated misery. You know who you are.

The Hanna Gray Story 
When for the umpteenth time, the 
Yale Daily News ran that photograph 
of Hanna Gray standing, arms folded, 
looking cross, word was sent to 
Woodbridge Hall that it would be 
nice for the News -
and for Mrs. 
Gray -
to obtain a new picture. A 
photographer went over for a shutter 
session and Gray -
who reportedly 
hates to have her picture taken 
because none will do her justice -
did not show up. The editors then 
sent the photographer to follow her 
around in public. He did -
for an 
hour -
but Mrs. Gray never un-
folded her arms long enough for the 
photographer to take a different 
picture. 

As Yale enters the flfth month of 
interregnum, with Provost Hanna 
Gray as Acting President, the para-
dox that surrounds her administration 
can be deflned more clearly. Unlike 
the charismatic politician who is 
loved by those who don't know him 
and an anathema to those who do, 
Hanna Gray is well liked by her staff. 
Beyond what may only be a veneer of 
unapproa~hability, they report that 
she has an incisive sense of humor. 
Most of them, from Corporation 
members to administrative members 
of the faculty, find her quite ap-
proachable; some say that they enjoy 
working with "Hanna" more than 
they enjoyed working with 
"Kingman." ··with Brewster, you 
never were quite sure what he 
expected of you," said one adminis-
trator who is close to both. "Things 
run much more smoothly." 

With the door closed, the Presi-
dent's Offlce in Woodbridge Hall 
looks like a closet. It is about the size 
of a Yale .College single room -
without the fireplace. For Hanna 
Gray, the space must be quite con-
fining. Her Pffice as Provost -
the 
one which is really hers -
is a large 
conference room in the Hall of 
Graduate Studies. But half of her 
days since May, when Brewster 
resigned to become Ambassador to 
Great Britain, have been spent in this 
offlce. 

Mrs. Gray has kept Brewster's 
small desk which faces the wall. 
Brewster's John F. Kennedy rocker 
sits facing the new couch she has 
installed. The light green curtains are 
hers, too. But the trappings of office, 
the sense of commanding, is just not 
there. These are temporary quarters. 
Bookshelves remain bare, containing 
only that skeleton of Yale histories 
and class books which Mr. Brewster 
did not pack with him. Pictures have 
disappeared; only the hooks remain. 

The administration which is run 
from this offlce is the same one which 
was structured and orchestrated by 
Kingman Brewster, who sat at the 
desk for fourteen years. And, until a 
new President is appointed, it is 
Gray's determination to keep the 
University on the general course that 
Brewster set. 

"Some people look at this as a 
transition period and see uncertainty," 
says Gray. "Actually, a great many, 
things need doing but the uncertainty 
is not so great. So much of what is 
needed to be done here has always 
been the responsibility of the Uni-
versity as a whole." 

Kingman Brewster was a man who 
spent a great deal of his time on the 
fundraising trail for the Campaign for 
Yale during his last years in office. 
His schedule, which had once in-
cluded a monthly appearance at one 
of the residential colleges, was 
replaced by a schedule which sent him 
instead to breakfasts with alumni 
groups in Atlanta and dinner the 
same day in New Haven. Brewster 
was also a much sought-after spokes-
man for t,he fate of higher education. 

How much to fill these shoes, in 
the midst of a presidential search that 
may well replace her, is Hanna Gray's 
dilemma. The day-to-day duties she 
sees as simply ••an expanded Provost-
ship." 

"There is a big difference between 
being a President and being an acting 
President," says Stanley Flink, direc-
tor of Alumni Communications and 
Public Information. "Mrs. Gray can 
be a very strong management flgure 
without having to worry about the 
range of public activities which are a 
President's responsibility." 

Mrs. Gray demonstrated her talent 
for "strong internal management" 
with her handling of the strike. Union 
officials who gambled that holding off 
a · strike until the school year began 
would wreak havoc on Gray's ad-
ministration have lost. Yale holds 
firm to their predetermined contract 
offers, and .Deputy Provost George 
Langdon and Associate Provost 
Radley Daly have been assigned to 
coordinate the University's response 
among non-striking personnel. 

The long term work of developing 
solutions to Yale's financial crisis 
continues as usual. Last Friday, when 
the· second rebate checks were paid to 
students, negotiations remained at an 
impasse. Mrs. Gray flew off to 
California for a meeting of the Center 
for Advanced Study on Behavioral 
Sciences and a Sunday brunch with 
West Coast volunteers for the Cam-
paign for Yille. 

Vincent Sirabella, business 
manager for AFL-CIO Local 35, the 
Yale unit on strike, is not above 
charges of political ambition himself 
in questions of what motivated the 
job action. Yet he sees the plain 
pattern in Mrs. Gray's actions. 

"I have it from very reliable 
sources," said Sirabella the day before 
the strike began, .. that Hanna Gray 
has been told she can be the President 
of Yale if she does three things. First, 
fix Yale's deficit. Second, make the 
Campaign for Yale a success. And 
third, break my union." 

"That is, of course, absurd," re-
sponded Gray later. She has heard 
charges of the sort before. 

"There is always the sense that 
what is done or not done by an 
Acting President will be seen as a sign 
of ideas of ambitions," continued the 
Acting President. "It's inevitable, and 
you sort of have to live with the fact. 
That level of discourse is not very 
helpful at all." 

Whether Gray wants to be Presi-
dent of Yale- though most people 
assume she does -
is something she 
keeps to herself. Anything she does to 
change the way she -
or Yale -
does things can bring additional 
the new journal, October 20, 1977 
painful charges that her actions are 
motivated by ambition. So she lives 
with a "damned if you do, damned if 
you don't" situation, maintaining a 
low profile. Her speaking engage-
ments are kept at a minimum. Mrs. 
Gray's public posture is only to 
participate in those parts of the 
traditional role of the Presidency that 
are inescapable. "She has not had to 
be involved, as Mr. Brewster was, in 
performing the role of spokesman for 
higher education for Yale and the 
independent colleges," says Flink. 

"She is not the President," said one 
supporter, in reaction to criticism that 
Gray's administration is necessarily 
static ... Everyone expects her to act 
like the President. It's anguish. You 
have to act it, but you're not it., 

Other administrators report that 
the Presidential search has had a 
decided effect on the number of new 
policy matters brought up by Ad-
ministration members. They claim 
that Gray will not implement or 
develop new policy which could 
co~ct with the goals of a new 
President. "To stop an idea halfway 
through is worse than not starting it 
at all," says University Secretary 
Chauncey ... But there's no point in 
not going ahead with plans for 
projects in certain areas. After a 
President is selected, we'll be ready." 

Gray continues her administration 
"on a tough tightrope,, .. on one 
corner of the stage in the spotlight," 
or "with bullets constantly whizzing 
by her bead," depending on which 
metaphor of which University offlcial 
suits you. Substantive policy changes, 
except those budgetary decisions 
which are the prerogative of the 
Provost or initiated by the Corpora-
tion, will wait on the Search Com-
mittee's decision. And, as another 
campus likely candidate for the job 
put it, "I know she and I both hope 
the committee comes to a decision 
within a month or two.,

Hanna Holborn was four years old 
when she first came to Yale. The year 
was 1934; her parents were among the 
first of the academics who came from 
Germany to escape the Nazis. Her 
father, Hajo Holborn, joined the Yale 
faculty in European History. A 
Sterling Professor here until his death 
in 1969, Holborn's entry in Who's 
Who is, for the time being, longer 
than his daughter's. 

One evening a few weeks ago, 
Gray's position as Acting President of 
Yale put her on the dais of the kick-
off dinner for the New Haven area 
United Way Campaign. Also at the 
head table was Vincent Sirabella. As 
Mrs. Gray was introduced to the 
audience as a life-long New Havenite 
who had attended the Foote School, 
an observer saw Sirabella's jaw drop 
in amazement. "Here was Sirabella 
who thought Hanna Gray came from 
outer space somewhere. He had never 
heard that she went to the same 
school his daughter does now. •• 

The New Haven of Hanna Gray's 
childhood was one of an elm-lined 
Hillhouse A venue with a mansion, 
rather than a tower, at the end. 
Science Hill was called Sachem Hill. 
"That's where we went sliding and 
learned to cross-country ski," remem-
bers Gray. She continues to ski today 
as often as possible, with her husband 
at their house in Vermont. 

At the precocious age of 15 Hanna 
Holborn entered Bryn Mawr College. 
Her prime extracurricular activity was 
the Bryn Mawr College News. "We 
were not very kind to the Adminis-
tration," says Gray with a laugh. 
''Bryn Mawr did not have a Phi 
Beta Kappa chapter. We led a 
campaign against bringing it on 
campus. Our motives were part 
snobbery, part populism. The snob-
bery was the feeling that surely 
everybody at Bryn Mawr rated Phi 
Beta Kappa, so why have it at all. 
The other reason was that we thought 
the curriculum was too rough, and 
none of us would make it." 

Almost as soon as Gray became a 
giaduate student at Radcliffe, she was 
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. "By then 
I'd grown up," said Gray. "I was-a 
little embarrassed about my previous 
history." 

After her college journalism experi-
ence, Gray told the New York Times 
last year that she hoped to find a 
glamorous New York publishing 
career. Somehow though, the family 
tradition of scholarship prevailed. 
Gray was a Fulbright Scholar at 
Oxford from 1950 to 1952, and 
received her history Ph.D. from 
Radcliffe in 1957. In 1954 she married 
Charles Montgomery Gray, also a 
career educator, who is now Senior 
Research Associate at the Yale Law 
School. 

For seven years after receiving her 
doctorate, Gray took junior faculty 
teaching posts at Bryn Mawr, 
Harvard, and the University of 
Chicago. Tenure came at the Uni-
versity of Chicago in 1964, where she 
continued her work in general 
European history, with a concentra-
tion in the intellectual development of 
the Renaissance and Reformation. 

Sooner or later most modern 
scholars have to choose between 
academics and administration; Gray 
took the fateful step in I 972 when she 
was named Dean of the College of 
Arts and Sciences at Northwestern 
University. Just a year before, Gray 
had been elected a successor trustee 
of the Yale Corporation and was one 
of the fmt two women in Yale history 
to serve as a trustee. 

"The post at Northwestern was 
particularly interesting," notes the 
Dean, who left the job to come to 
Yale as Provost. "The time was right 
to go into administration. It's an 
extension of my interests." 

It was then up to Kingman 
Brewster, who was seeking to flll the 
Provost's job vacated by now Under-
secretary of State for Economic 
Affairs, Richard Cooper. Sources say 
that Brewster was looking for a 
woman. The person he found, the 
person who assumed his duties as 
Acting President last spring, was 
Hanna Gray. It was late 1974, and 
the budget problems of the expansive 
Brewster years had just come home to 
roost. 

Iri the peaceful mornings, before 
the cars outside have turned Hill-
house. A venue from a quiet residential 
street to a linear parking lot, Mrs. 
Charles Montgomery Gray is a 
gardener. The Provost's House, right 
next to the Secretary's House and two 
doors down from the President's 
House, has a sunporch. Mrs. Gray 
has turned it into a greenhouse. Every 
day, at about half past eight, the 
plants are watered and pruned. By 
nine or nine-thirty she is gone. 

Whether her first stop is the 
President's Office in Woodbridge Hall 
or the Provost's Office in HGS is 
determined by the events of the day. 
Her schedule is precise to the point 
that time is equally divided between 
the two offices. For the most part, 
her day is broken up into half hour 
segments. Meetings with her staff, 
other Corporation officers, and mem-
bers of the Provost's Office are 
frequent and expeditious. 

"We all know that we should work 
a little harder and a little longer 
before we go into meetings with her," 
said Associate Provost for Personnel 
Rad Daly. "I have a sense that I want 
to come into meetings with all the 
homework done." 

"People who work with her know 
they need to have something to say, 
and that they better say it clearly," 
says Gregory Campbell, an Assistant 
to the Acting President who was a 
junior colleague with Gray in the 
University of Chicago's European 
History Department. "You couldn't 
run a discussion group or a seminar 
without doing that either." 

The academic feeling around her 
prevails. Some people who have 
talked to her feel that she "suffers 
fools badly;" officials around her 
confirm she is demanding -
to a 
point. 

"She hates to be interrupted," 
observed one Corporation officer. 
"She'll just go right on talking. But 
I've never seen her_ interrupt anyone 
else either. 

"It is especially funny to see 
someone who has a point to make 
which has to be made immediately. 
She'll just ignore them until she is 
finished." 

"It's not that opposition is not 
allowed," says Campbell. "The ques-
tion is whether the point is of worth. 
A discussion will continue as long as 
there's substance." 

"But she tries to warm up a 
meeting fmt," says one Provost 
officer. "During the playoffs we might 
discuss the relative merits of the 
Yankees and the Red Sox," adds 
Campbell. "She's a Yankee fan." 

Lunches are usually working affairs 
held in the Officers Dining Room 
above Commons or at Mory's. 
During long meetings at the Provost's 
office around a conference table 
sandwiches will be brought in.

"The President's Office in Woodbridge is about the size of a Yale 
College single room- without the fireplace. For Hanna Gray, the 
space must be quite confining." 
"At an Officers' lunch she's usually 
the leader in spoofing somebody," 
notes Chauncey. "And usually it's the 
Secretary -
me." 

On the day the strike began, retired 
Associate Secretary George Vaill 
asked in jest if he should join a picket 
line. "No, George," replied Gray, "but 
you could go home ·and make us 
some cookies." 

During the first week of school, a 
member of the German Department 
of Yale University received an 
engraved invitation to a reception at 
43 Hillhouse.Avenue. But the card 
puzzled him. "Mr. and Mrs. Charles 
M. Gray request the honor of your 
presence at a reception," read the 
card. He took the invitation home to 
his wife. "Do you know any Charles 
Gray?" asked the professor. She 
didn't either. Finally they figured it 
out. 

Last week the Grays gave another 
party unlike anything ever seen at the 
Brewsters. People said later, "Gee, 
wasn't that fun." And at the receiving 
line for the freshmen the Grays didn't 
want to have a student introducing 
them. Informality reigned; there's 
something less royal on Hillhouse 
too. 

As Acting President, Hanna Gray 
Jacks authority to rearrange Yale's 
priorities. However, she can and is 
preparing the way for the financial 
pruning which must be the first task 
of a permanent President. 

The most important policy objec-
tive for the interim administration is 
to devise a process of budgeting 
which will prevent Yale from again . 
acquiring huge unforeseen deficits. 
This year a controllable, anticipated 
$800,000 budget overrun turned into 
a whopping deficit of $6 million. 

Two major reports will emerge 
from the administration in the coming 
year; both will have important conse-
quences for the way Yale raises and 
spends money. On the immediate 
horizon is the work of Anthony 
Knerr, a new Gray appointee who is 
Special Assistant to the President for 
Budget and Planning. His report will 
be released in November,' and from 
then on Yale's funds will be spent 
through "programmed budgeting." 

Not unlike Carter's "zero-base" ap-
proach, the change will put the total 
cost of each Yale program into one 
budget column. 

Knowing the "real cost" of each 
program will help administrators to 
relegate priorities. Hence, it will be 
easier to "trade off," and shift one use 
of resources to another: 

"The system will improve our 
.ability to control budgets so that 
people can be held accountable," says 
Associate Provost Daly. "It will be 
able to send up warning signals 
throughout the year if things aren't 
going right." 

And in the long run, when aca-
demic goals meet with budgetary 
realities, programmed budgets will 
mean a big difference. Bluntly, the 
object is cuts. "It's a problem of 
defining our weaknesses when we 
want to eliminate them to build our 
strengths," concludes one planning 
official. 

Due to the recent extension of the 
Campaign for Yale until next June, 
Corporation Officer for Institutional 
Development Charles Lord has more 
time to consider a replacement pro-
gram which will continue to seek 
capital for Yale's endowment. Until 
the Campaign for Yale, endowment 
funds were raised on an "as needed" 
basis; from now on there is little 
indication that Yale's thirst for more 
endowment will ever be satiated. 

Lord should be reporting directly 
to the Corporation on this issue 
sometime next year. His final formu-
lation, though, surely awaits the 
arrival of a permanent President. 

"We are surely going to need a 
continuing development effort," says 
Gray. "It will be a separate office 
concerned with maintaining a con-
tinued relationship with other kinds 
of donors." 

The "other donors" Gray seeks are 
in addition to "Yale's own" who are 
solicited by the Alumni Fund. It takes 
more than old school ties to win 
funds from corporations and founda-
tions. 

"This is something we've learned 
from the Campaign," says Gray.

Derrida at Yale: "Please Don't Quote" 
by Leslie Anderson 
Jacques Derrida admitted in an 
interview that he is a cautious writer 
and speaker. He asked me not to 
quote him in this article, explaining 
that in view of the care he takes not 
to simplify in a written text, be is 
hesitant to generalize in an interview, 
or have his ideas simplified within a 
quotation. In his writing, he will not 
state his logic outright, though he 
invites the reader to pursue it to its 
radical end. One often feels that his 
conclusions are only implicit, al-
though crucial in understanding and 
evaluating him. If one attacks Derrida 
regarding the inferential quality of his 
writing, be can reply that he never 
said such and such; his caution pays 
off. 

A professor of philosophy at the 
Ecole Normale Superieure, Derrida 
confines his teaching in France to 
philosophical history, but in the 
United States be is known primarily 
as a literary critic of the Post-
Structuralist school. As a guest 
lecturer in the Comparative Literature 
Department at Yale this fall, be gave 
four lectures in French on Heidegger's 
"The Origin of the Work of Art," 
four lectures in French on Freud's 
Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and 
one lecture in English entitled "Ltd., 
Inc." on his own article, "Signature 
Event Context" and "Reiterating the 
Differences: a Reply to Derrida" by 
John R. Searle. 

I asked Derrida why he felt he was 
so controversial. He answered some-
what self-consciously that his type of 
deconstruction destroys the founda-
tion for all the presuppositions of 
Western philosophy, academic insti-
tutions and political beliefs, and 
described his method as a very minute 
questioning into all that forms the 
basis of culture. His essays and 
lectures supply the presuppositions 
and bases that he has in mind. 

Western man assumes that his 
language comes from and points to 
material reality. Science, philosophy, 
and every other discipline consider 
their development part of a pro-
gression towards an absolute, external 
truth. Derrida believes that the 
"truths" man discovers in nature are 
only the assumptions and prejudices 
with which he perceives it. In his 
English lecture, "Ltd., Inc.", Derrida 
used this argument to attack Marx's 
claim that economic principles gave 
rise to th~ superstructure of culture 
and ideas, as well as to his own 
political theory. Derrida noted that, 
like everyone else, Marx had to 
idealize objects in order to talk about 
them: his conclusions simply repro-
duce those ideologies, or in Derrida's 
words, "the axiomatic that belongs to 
the entire philosophy." 

"Derrida's analysis makes no distinction between philosophical, 
literary or scientific texts. He is not interested in finding the meaning 
or 'right interpretation' of a text, but in explaining how, as a text, it 
increases human understanding, and why human understanding 
always involves texts, just as it always involves metaphors." 

Marx tried hopelessly to circum-
vent ideology. Philosophers, obsessed 
by purity, try in t.he same way to 
avoid using metaphors. Within Litera-
ture, one word can have many 
different meanings and several dif-
ferent words can have the same 
meaning. "Sun" is the father of nature 
or the "son" of God. "God," "seed," 
"gold," "sun," "eye," and "Father," 
are interchangeable in certain con-
texts. Philosophers attempting to 
transcend this web of meanings speak 
in an abstract language of "concepts" 
which are meant to be "univocal," or 
free of any metaphorical associations. 
But according to Derrida, every 
concept bas a metaphorical com-
ponent. When someone says "My 
essays are rid of metaphors -
I am a 
pure thinker," or in Marx's words, "I 
am a materialist" he has merely 
resorted to a rhetorical device, 
turning ideology and idolatry into 
. "truth." Man must think through 
. metaphors and, in a larger sense, 
through texts. Metaphors do not 
entrap thought until men enshrine 
them, as they have the Bible, 
Aristotle, Marx, and Freud. In our 
interview, Derrida criticized Marxists 
for treating Marx as though he were 
sacred, and added that he personally 
does not have any sacred texts. 

Professors have embraced the 
language of their disciplines, wrap-
ping themselves up in the security of 
departmental discourse. Derrida 
threatens this security, as a philoso-
pher whose literary criticism is more 
radical and consistent than that of 
literary critics. Derrida's analysis 
makes no distinction between philo-
sophical, literary or scientific texts. 
He is not interested in finding the 
meaning or "right interpretation" of a 
text, but in explaining how, as a text, 
it increases human understanding, 
and why human understanding always 
involves texts, just as it always 
involves metaphors. 

Geoffrey Hartman, a professor of 
English at Yale, feels that Derrida's 
importance lies in his "totally non-
sentimental secularism." He bas 
changed the way many people think 
about literature, encouraging them to 
consider the whole phenomenon of 
literary thinking beyond specific 
works and disturbing the disciplinary 
boundaries of philosophy, literature, 
and science .with his textual approach. 
But he accomplishes this by dis-
regarding the importance of the 
content of the individual work. In 
examining only the rhetorical power 
and devices of a text, he precludes 
any moral judgment about it. 

Perhaps just such a "non-senti-
mental secularism" is the most 
interesting and fruitful way to look at 
literature and philosophy today, but 
is it also, as Derrida suggests, the best 
way to talk about po~tics, scien~ and 
religion? Deconstruction seems 1nade-
quate for studying the Bible, the 
speech of a presidential' candidate, or 
an article on a breakthrough in 
medical research. Derrida bas devel-
oped a critical method that is 
primarily manneristic; it concerns the 
form rather than the content of the 
text. 

Derrida stated in our interview that 
be is trying to change the code of 
political discourse so that some topics 
will be understood as political which 
have never been seen as such before. 
He attacks those who assume that 
philosophy, literature or speech are 
free from anthropomorphism and 
cultural prejudice: value judgments of 
a political nature are implicit in 
language. We are tempted to believe 
that opposites such as simple/com-
plex, light/ dark, presence/absence, 
life/ death represent oppositions in 
nature, that they are impersonal, 
"true," and the basis of defining 
words. Derrida claims that there is no 
such thing as natural opposition. In 
"Signature Event Context" he says 
that opposites are only statements of 
human preference, which arbitrarily 
compare two things. They are "never 
the confrontation of two terms, but a 
hierarchy and the order of a sub-
ordination." We assume that simple is 
better than complex, light better than 
darkness: these judgments have 
shaped the "absolutes" of philosophy 
into expressions of prejudice and 
politics. And, like his literary 
criticism, Derrida's politics are man-
neristic. They deal with definitions: 
analyses of rhetoric taking place after 
the words are spoken and the action 
concluded. His theories are not 
concerned with correcting actual 
problems or enacting people's desires; 
in fact, Derrida's excessive self-
consciousness undermines the values 
and feelings that would generate 
political action. 

The nihilism of Derrida's method 
of analysis becomes Clearer in view of 
the theory of truth that underlies his 
work. Derrida rejects Saussure's 
theory that a word is a sign 
expressing a nonverbal meaning or 
referent, and replies that the con-
nection between language and referent 
or external truth is only arbitrary, 
that our oppositions of meaning come 
from cultural prejudices and do not 
reflect any natural dichotomy. In 
"Signature Event Context," he says 
that "the absence of a referent is a 
possibility easily enough admitted 
today ... the potential presence of 
the referent at the moment it is 
designated does not modify in the 
slightest the structure of the mark, 
which implies that the mark can do 
without the referent." The possibility 
of an absent referent is the basis of all 
speech and writing. According to 
Derrida, human thought and desire 
do not produce speech and, perhaps, 
do not exist. It follows that moral 
outrage and physical hardship do not 
produce political discourse because its 
text may be studied independently of 
the social context. Derrida reverses 
Marx's theory that economic con-
ditions produce the superstructure of 
culture and thought. Rather, the 
superstructure manifests itself in dif-
ferent metaphorical combinations. 

The controversy that surrounds 
Derrida concerns his style of presen-
tation as well as his radical theories. 
His essays have become increasingly 
literary in form over the last ten 
years, substantiating his arguments, 
and seducing the reader with the 
brilliance of his style as well as with 
logic. Many people dislike the com-
plexity with which he writes and 
speaks, and some considered his 
Heidegger lectures self-indulgent; 
others felt that his ideas were not 
worth the trouble it took to grasp 
them through his maze of rhetoric. 
Nevertheless, all of his lectures were 
well-attended, and Derrida expressed 
surprise at the number of American 
students who have adopted his 
~schemas" in their own critical 
method. Derrida himself may be seen 
as a text, and as such, he, too, may 
become a dogma. 

Derrida does not discard the basis 
of Western culture merely to build 
another in its stead: he describes his 
deconstruction as a process that has 
no end. But one wonders at the 
practicability of this aim. As other 
critics take up his method, he may be 
swallowed by the system which he 
attacks. H man always needs meta-
phors and structures with which to 
think, it seems, judging from his 
reception at Yale this fall, that 
Derrida bas become the latest one.

**Austerity at Yale**

to the infighting to be tough. But to 
explain away something controver-
sial -
to the faculty, to the alumni -
how would she do it?" 

"On the day the strike began, retired Associate Secretary George Vaill 
asked in jest if he should join a picket line. 'No George; replied Gray, 
'but you could go home and make us some cookies.·" 

Indeed, descriptions of Gray's per-
sonality further make her suited for 
an acting Presidency which is pri-
marily concerned with budgetary 
issues. In her dual role, she acts as a 
"super Provost." 

"Kingman was a pragmatic oppor-
tunist," notes Sam Chauncey, who 
worked with Brewster through his 
entire tenure here. "He saw an idea 
and said, 'Go do it. rm on the 
bandwagon.' Hanna is a logical 
rationalist. She is analytical and 
methodical, like a surgeon." 

And those qualities -
as Chauncey 
and others have defined them -
fit 
the times. The age of austerity at Yale 
would frustrate a dreamer like 
Brewster. These days call for a 
different kind of innovation, of ways 
not to build, but to extricate Yale 
from a fmancial mess. Gray seems 
likely to leave the acting Presidency 
with Yale in a lot better shape than it 
was when she took over. 

Doubts about suitability are also 
apparent, especially within the lower 
echelon which doesn't work with Mrs. 
Gray every day. 

"God, she's hard to talk to. She is. 
I can't get anywhere. You try to have 
a little chit-chat, and you can't get 
through. 

"It's fine when Gray has to make 
the tough decisions; a more gre-
garious person might be too exposed 

This kind of testimony, criticalas 
well as supportive, is the talk which 
goes on in a Presidential search. 
Associates close to Brewster when he 
was an Acting President -
and the 
leading candidate for the permanent 
job -
report it was even tougher. 

As long as Hanna is running the 
house that Kingman built, a com-
parison of her manner with his way 
of running things is proper. It's not 
yet entirely her show. As ever, the 
pressure of the Presidential search 
may have put a damper on the way 
Gray runs things. But the comparison 
between Gray and Brewster is as 
much a product of the times as it is 
of their different personalities. 

One event last year made the 
comparison quite clear. In a televised 
news conference in HGS a smiling 
Kingman Brewster was there to 
announce the appointment of Frank 
Ryan as athletic director. When the 
bright lights went out, though, it was 
Gray's turn. She was the one to tell 
us Yale is entering an age of austerity. 

Does her newness to that office 
upstairs in Woodbridge make it easier 
for Hanna Gray to say "no"? Some 
officials think that with Gray in 
charge, it wiU be easier for Yale to 
balance this year's budget. 

"How could Brewster possibly not 
feel a very strong bond with people 
who went through the late sixties with 
him?" asked one official in response. 

Gray has the chance to make some 
cutbacks where Brewster, with 
political ties for fourteen years, 
couldn•t. "Hard, unemotional, ruth-
less decisions are impossible to make 
which hurt people you've been 
through tough times with," says one 
official. 

But Gray demurs. "I don't think 
that long years of political ties cut 
one way or the other. A person who 
has been here longer might have deb~ 
to call in." 

"So much of the decision making 
depends on process," she notes. 
"Personal or individual considera-
tiohs usually have less of an effect. •• 

But the discussion continues: Gray 
is hardly an outsider. She has been 
here -
and a part of the budget-
making process of the Brewster 
administration -
for almost three 
years. But the types of programs 
which, in the long run, may face 
cutbacks are the things such as 
counseling and decentralized dean•s 
offices, costly academic programs 
which were added during the Brewster 
years. And these are the things which 
would have been harder for Brewster 
to cut than for any of his successors. 

"Hanna keeps reminding people 
that the deficits do not reflect poor 
performance. Yale's overspending has 
not been waste," says Charles Lord. 
"The market didn't stay the way it 
was going. We're no longer willing to 
wait for external events to balance 
our budg"!t." 

"Everybody is for cutting back," 
notes Deputy Provost George 
Langdon. "But every department 
wants things cut far from them. And 
if you start to take away some T A's 
in history, that's an explosive issue 
with the Yale College Council. Some-
where, though, we'll have to give up a 
big piece here or there. •• 

If internally the Administration's 
biggest challenge is to formulate an 
effective budgeting process which wiU 
preclude unforeseen deficits, the 
biggest problem on the outside is 
convincing Yale's constituencies of the 
severity of its problems. 

"It's very, very hard," says Deputy 
Provost George Langdon. "For a long 
time we've lived on the theory that 
bigger is better." 

But Gregory Campbell, Mrs. Gray's 
assistant, contradicts the idea that the 
best way to fix Yale's difficulties is to 
label it as an immediately curable 
crisis. 

"Sliding into a war is the opposite 
of a rational process," said Campbell, 
who is also a European historian. 
" We do not want to make light of 
financial difficulties which are ob-
viously real. On the other hand, we 
do not want to exaggerate like 
Chicken Little. Our policy is just 
consistency, based on rational analy-
sis on a continual basis." 

Perhaps Mrs. Gray has an advan-
tage. Her administration, detached 
from its constituents by the pressures 
of a Presidential search, can begin to 
make some of those hard budgetary 
decisions which ruffle people's 
feathers. Yes, art schools want funds 
cut fairly -
away from their disci-
pline. But the immediate ranking of 
priorities, and making the best of 
Yale's strengths, may require harsh-
ness ... a harshness that Gray can 
handle. These are the budget de-
cisions which must be made in the 


So Hanna Gray is on a tightrope. 
No one knows the effect of any 
Presidential action on Yale's fund-
raising. Alumni who deferred giving 
to the Campaign until Brewster 
resigned can now say they don•t like 
Gray. When a permanent President is 
appointed they can excuse themselves 
by demanding to wait and see what 
the new President's policy is. But 
excuses or not, Yale's uncertain 
financial future -
and its totally 
undefined Presidential future -
will 
be hard on the Campaign. The 
problems of a Presidential search are 
toughest for those campus officials 
whose names are on the list. Public 
discussion of policy demands cer-
tainties. The only certainty of the 
moment is that Yale does not have a 
President.

Although he has been in love with 
and apparently made love to Judith 
Hastings, the attractive Radcliffe 
overachiever, Francis now rebuffs her 
amorous advances. Once he explains 
that he has developed a crush on a 
Harvard sophomore (male), Judith 
quickly recognizes her brother Randy 
as the object of Francis' affections. 
When this threesome is left alone 
onstage, the play often threatens to 
become serious; but the hilarious 
inanities of Herschel and the older 
generation diffuse the tensions of the 
central situation. Staged asthma 
attacks, threatened suicides, and slap-
stick pratfalls combine with 
Innaurato's lively and witty dialogue 
to turn a potential sexual nightmare 
into a rambunctious farce. 

Unfortunately, verbal pyrotechnics 
and stage stunts also obscure the 
forward action of the play. John 
Gielgud once noted, in connection 
with his production of The Impor-
tance of Being Earnest, that it is 
important for a director to learn how 
to prevent the audience from laughing 
in too many places. Innaurato and 
Peter Mark Scrufter, the director of 
Gemini, must share the blame for 
allowing the play to become more 
about the personalities and past 
histories of the older people than 
about the present frustrations faced 
by the youngsters. Danny Aiello, as 
Fran, Ann DeSalvo, as his mistress, 
and Jessica James, as the blowzy 
nextdoor neighbor, turn in the 
strongest performances of this pro-
duction and in doing so throw the 
play off balance. Despite the fact that 
the play centers on the figure of 
Francis, the character is underwritten 
by lnnaurato and underplayed by 
Robert Picardo. Each of the older 
characters gets at least one Benno-like 
aria in which he explains how he 
understands himself and his friends. 
The younger generation must do 
without this dramatic luxury. Francis 
moves from brooding to quipping to 
cake-slinging without ever giving us a 
glimpse of how he thinks. Conse-
quently, a few good speeches and a 
lot of good fun hang on a very thin 
plot line. 

And the fun is very good indeed. 
At the end of their first evening in 
town, Judith and Randy are treated 
to a spaghetti dinner on a folding 
table in the backyard. Each character 
approaches his meal differently; the 
emotional entanglements of the day 
have affected appetites in a variety of 
ways. But everyone eats -
except 
Lucille, Fran's widow lady. Lucille is 
not hungry. Lucille will just "pick." 
And pick she does; like one of 
Hitchcock's birds she swoops down 
on everyone else's plate, retrieving 
now some pasta, now a little salad, 
now a piece of bread -
repeatedly 
refusing a plate of her own. Anne 
DeSalvo, who won an Obie for this 
performance (as did Aiello for his), 
plays the scene hilariously but, like 
many other such wacky moments in 
the play, a bravura turn interrupts the 
flow of the action. DeSalvo also 
creates the play's most compassionate 
moment as she lectures Judith on 
homosexuality. Having a son at Yale 
"where they turn out a Jot of queers, 
along with the doctors and lawyers," 
Lucille feels that she can advise the 
younger woman on the love and 
understanding that Francis needs. In 
a somewhat fantastic fashion -
and 
with a great deal of sentimentality -
the older generation appreciates 
Francis' uncomfortable predicament 
even better than Francis or his 
contemporaries. 

The play's ending, like the play 
itself, begs all serious questions. In 
the off-off-Broadway productions 
done at Playwrights Horizons and the 
Performing Arts Foundation Play-
house, Gemini concluded with Francis 
alone at his bedroom window, playing 
Callas as he had at the opening of the 
first act. Judith and Randy having 
departed with minimal hopes for a 
resolution to their dilemma in the fall, 
Francis settled back into discontented 
isolation. In what may have been 
conceived of as a pre-Broadway 
"jollying up," the play now pauses 
where it once ended; after fifty 
seconds of soul searching Francis now 
asks himself that classic question 
posed by every potential heel from a 
boy-gets-girl film comedy: "What am 
I doing?" A few joyful screams to the 
neighbors serve to recall Judy and 
Randy in enough time for Francis to 
join them on their trip back home, 
where our hero presumably will work 
out some solution to his identity 
crisis. Although this is by no means a 
completely happy ending, the hoopla 
that accompanies it drowns out any 
objections that might be raised. Once 
again, the formal demands of comedy 
overwhelm the problems that the play 
raises. 

As its successful run on Broadway 
indicates, audiences certainly find 
Gemini more palatable than Denno 
Blimpie. It is a funny play finely 
acted. But for those of us who have 
enjoyed the broad, grotesque strokes 
of Innaurato's previous work -
including his collaboration with 
Christopher Durang on the Yale 
Rep's Idiots Karamazov 
Gemini 
cannot help but be disappointing. 
lnnaurato has diluted his style, his 
humor, and his subject matter to 
produce a naturalistic, sit-com, 
bisexual-chic hit.

**David Hockney by David Hockney**
**Author: Curt Sanburn**

David Hockney x David Hockney

David Hockney by David Hockney 
Nikos Stangos, editor. 
Harry Abrams, publisher, New York. 
3 I 2 pp., illustrated with 434 illus-
trations, 60 full color plates, $37.50 
The name David Hockney is batted 
about by friends of mine with the 
same exclusive tone of voice used on 
cocaine and lofts. It sounds c.s though 
they've got the corner on something 
vaguely classy, deliciously decadent, 
and impossibly inaccessible to anyone 
else. Well, in fact, David Hockney is 
a very good painter, and the publica-
tion of his autobiography/catalogue 
raisonne, David Hockney by David 
Hockney, should cleanse Mr. 
Hockney of the pop-kitsch-faggot-
media-event image thai his trend 
cultists would have you and me 
believe. 

The text is an edited version of 
twenty-five hours of taped conversa-
tion between Hockney and his editor 
Nikos Stangos. Hockney's rambling, 
loose-weave narrative is informal and 
informative. The tone is pleasantly 
erudite and modest. We hear about 
nearly all of the 434 paintings, 
sketches, and prints included in the 
book, representing the great body of 
his work since 1957. All of this is set 
against a dense background of illus-
trative detail: anecdotal portraits of 
friends, comments on other artists, 
musings on art, and forecasts for the 
future of Hockney's own work. I 
haven't seen as warm and compre-
hensive a view of a living painter 
since Frank O'Hara's monograph on 
Robert Motherwell. 

Hockney's art resists easy classifica-
tion. The artist explains that he was 
"slightly interested in photo-realism," 
but more interested in an "interpre-
tation of the photograph;" he ex-
plores the flatness of objects in a 
photograph and extrapolates from the 
photographic process an original kind 
of figurative modernism in painting. 
The result: Spatial planes that blink 
into color fields and figures that slip 
out of three-dimensional representa-
tion, reappearing as flat signs of 
unusually articulate color. This free 
play between figurative, photographic, 
and color field painting is one of the 
bases of Hockney'-s art -
"eclecticism 
can be a synthesis." The reductive 
thrust of modernism in Hockney's 
work holds the precision of repre-
sentation in a delicate, sophisticated 
balance. 

This is all very ambitious, yet the 
paintings are proof of his success. 
Simplicity and water-like clarity (look 
at the famous pool paintings) belie an 
unfolding complexity of image and 
paint. In "Portrait of an Artist" 
( 1971), a dense and silent work, the 
taut images eventually disintegrate, 
letting their colors float free. It is an 
exhilarating sight. 

If only because of the inaccessibility 
of much of Hockney's work (most of it 
is in private collections; MOMA has a 
single drawing), this book is invaluable. 
places Hockney's art in the public 
domain. It is a comprehensive and 
lively record of a living artist's work 
and life. His prices will probably 
skyrocket as a result, and controversy 
will persist. 

Curt San burn descends from his loft 
to talk about art. 

The British Art Center will be 
exhibiting Hackney's works in 
February, 1978.

him somewhat. "I'm just going to glue 
the fucker down!" and so saying he 
produced the tiny tube and we had a 
grand time gluing objects all over the 
house. 

But this story is not about Krazy 
Glue and the only reason I mentioned 
The Hardware is that I'd never had a 
pushbutton system before and I felt it 
was long overdue. Christ! This is 1977 
and I knew that some cheap piece of 
crap wasn't going to cut it in our 
household. 

But I liked the slabby look of the 
Trimline and the pushbuttons (al-
though not the squared keyboard-type 
I had expected) had a terrific solid-
state look that reeked of efficiency. 
SNETCO seemed to be letting me 
know that if it weren't for geeks like 
Ralph Nader, flapping their wings 
about mindless safety precautions, I'd 
have the relays and switches right up 
front, the bare metal contacts await-
ing my touch. The receiver and 
keyboard were integrated on one unit 
on my new Trimline Totalphone, and 
with a digital dexterity normally 
found only in accordion players one 
could actually manage the whole 
procedure one-handed thereby per-
mitting the simultaneous operation of 
calculators and other electronic equip-
ment indigenous to a typical house-
hold of the computer age. Between 
classes and Star Trek reruns who has 
time to squander? 

The really impressive feature of the 
Totalphone service is that your unit 
looks no different from those used by 
plebes who might as well be talking 
to you from the Bronze Age. The 
hold button feature is enough to 
intimidate these clowns. ("Sorry 
Waldo -
other line") With a quick 
punch of the right index you are 
hooked up to the Mongo Mother 
Computer --,- the Big Ear that 
controls half the world (if ya can't 
beat 'em ... ) and by using all manner 
of codes provided by the SNETCO 
Totalphone info pamphlet you can do 
it all -
from launching a salvo of 
ICBM's to lighting up the Christmas 
tree on the White House lawn. 

The service also allows you to hold 
three-party conference calls and for-
ward calls to another number while 
you're out at the condensers or at 
droid maintenance. 

The most up-to-date feature of the 
T -phone is the speed call. By the deft 
use of one of the extra buttons on the 
keyboard (you know -
the ones with 
the tic-tac-toe board and the Egyptian 
symbol for Ankh) you can program 
the unit to ring up to eight numbers 
(alas, not simultaneously -
a techno-
phile such as myself must simply 
make do) by depressing a single key. 
Of course, one must accept such 
atrophied numeral retention as a 
natural consequence of the con-
venience, but we've done quite well 
over the last two decades without legs 
or digestive systems, so no great 
tragedy. 

Well, I justtapped the number 
seven and the button with the sigma 
notation symbol on it which tells you 
how you're feeling (galvanic skin 
response costs onlv an additional two 
doilars a month) ~nd with a click or 
two more I will have the horoscope 
for today. I am completely pleased 
with Toto -
he screens out annoying 
calls and his reassuring hum is a 
mainstay when I feel I am misunder-
stood by the fallible human world. 

With all of the options available in 
the complete package, I have no need 
for the telephone function, so I'm 
having it disconnected. Toto and I 
have no use for the others.

**Speed Reading at Yale**
**Author: Nick Defeis**

You have 34 seconds to finish 
this article: begin. 
In 1701, old El~m never guessed 
that by 1977, Yali~s \\jOuld need or 
want to learn how to tead, or he 
might have decided to' scrap his 
library and set up a trade school. But 
in the epoch of fast foods and one 
night stands, it was inevitable that 
speed reading would enter the Ivy 
League. 

You must have had one of those 
innocuous yellow flyers from Evelyn 
Wood slipped under your door by 
now. Since they offer no information, 
besides a promise to make you the 
fastest kid on the block (at least as 
far as reading is concerned), the only 
way to find out the true story of 
Evelyn Wood (this sounds like a 
porno flick) is to visit the Holiday 
Inn (maybe this is a porno flick) for a 
free session. 

At the introductory meeting you 
will be quoted a $300 price for seven 
meetings of several hours each. Before 
cashing in your food rebates, you will 
do well to consider a few points 
brought to light by recent Wood 
graduates. 

The most frequently mentioned 
criticism (200 words) of the course is 
that Evelyn Wood offers you nothing 
you couldn't learn yourself. Accord-
ing to one Yale source, "any 
well-written book on speed reading 
offers virtually the same course Wood 
does, at a fraction of the cost. I only 
wish I had known this last year." The 
teachers are not special; after the 
seven week program many partici-
pants felt qualified to teach the 
course. 

Nor is reading speed increased as 
dramatically as the advertisements 
claim. Though satisfaction is guaran-
teed or your money back, proving 
that you have managed not to learn 
anything is difficult. 

reading tests contain such easy pas-
sages and questions -
that only 
the simple-minded could fail to 
improve after learning the rudi-
mentary Wood skills. When reading is 
of a more obscure nature, Evelyn 
Wood offers as little help as your 
class notes. Just try flipping through 
the Principia Mathematica in an hour 
or two. 

Some Woodsies (Old Woods?) even 
claim that Evelyn Wood teaches very 
little reading; hours are spent on such 
extraneous items as notetaking and 
newspaper editing. (We hope that the 
board of the Daily News is reading 
this.) The fact that the course's 
syllabus includes these items indicates 
that Evelyn Wood doesn't have too 
much to teach. 

In the face of these criticisms, there 
are those who hold Evelyn (400 
words) Wood speed reading to be an 
invaluable part of their education. 
Some, like David Kelley, Wood '77, 
claim the $300 fee provides an 
incentive unavailable by purchasing a 
$3.00 "how to" book. Others accede 
to criticisms of the instructors and 
format, but counter these by asserting 
that you do indeed learn a new skill-
more than can be said of many Yale 
offerings at $600 a shot. Reading 
speed is definitely increased (273 
words -
you're losing ground!). 

There may be some loss of compre-
hension, but not nearly as much as in 
"skimming" the material without the 
benefit of speed-reading skills. 

So we are left with a rather faulty 
expose: the course does what it 
claims. I've garnered these opinions 
from people who took the c~urse, 
people who wish they had known all 
of this before plunking down the 
$300. Yet no one wholeheartedly 
regretted their investment, and no one 
was dissatisfied enough to demand a 
refund. Like any other course, speed 
reading involves some work, some 
disappointment, some learning. Look 
at it this way -
after having learned 
absolutely nothing from good old 
Psych I Ia, did you ever try and get 
your money back? 

600 words. It should have taken 
you exactly 34 seconds to read this 
article. Please answer the following 
questions: 
I) When was Yale founded? 
a) 1977 
b) 1701 
c) 344 words ago 
2) The law of excluded middle is

b) None of the above 
c) found in the Principia Mathe-
matica 
d) irrelevant to this article 
3) You learned nothing from Psych Ita 
because 
a) you were dropped on your head 
as a child 
b) you dropped the class after 2 
weeks 
c) you haven't taken speed reading 
d) False -you did learn something 
from Psych II a, and you are 
smarter than the staff of this 
magazine 
4) Old Woods are 
a) somewhere near New Canaan 
b) a brand of Scotch 
c) graduates of a speed-reading 
course

**Mailbox Overflow**
**Author:  Not specified**

When we returned to New Haven 
after a long hot summer (see Friend 
of Infamy, p. 2), we found our 
mailbox overflowing. The following 
items constitute a mere sampling: 
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
From ABC Records: 
With several national AOR sta-
tions, retail outlets and members of 
the press showing a substantially 
increased interest in Tom Petty and 
The Heartbreakers, the group is 
embarking on a series of concert 
dates throughout the West this fall. 
Petty and the Heartbreakers will be 
the opening act for Be Bop Deluxe on 
all six dates. 
Jay Morgenstern, President ABC/ 
Dunhill Music, INC. has recently 
successfully concluded negotiations 
for the acquisition of Lambert and 
Potter's interest in One of A Kind 
Music. 

Included in this prestigious cata-
logue are the Glen Campbell hits, 
"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in 
L.A.)" and "See You On Sunday," 
the score to the motion picture 
"Tunnelvision," Kiki Dee's "Once A 
Fool," Tavares' "It Only Takes A 
Minute," as well as the songs "You 
Brought the Woman Out of Me," 
••Baby Don't Be Giving Me Up," "My 
Ship," and ••stood Brothers" among 
others.

PAPER-
' BACK BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 
FROM PUFFIN: 
Everyone knows what Penguins 
and Pelicans are, but what, exactly, is 
a Puffin? A puffin - like a Pelican -
is a dignified bird with curious habits 
When in flight, the Puffin always 
seems to have a very large head. On 
land, it struts around in an erect pose 
with a contemplative, almost comical 
look. The summer home for millions 
of Puffins is the Westman Islands. 
There are Puffin colonies on thirteen 
of the islands when they take up 
residence in early spring. The Puffin 
lays only one egg each year.

• The hostess who rushes to empty 
the ash tray as soon as the cigarette 
butt appears in it ... 
• The excessively tidy-clean man who 
avoids sitting down at a party because 
he refuses to crease his trousers or 
jacket 
• The list maker so much in 
obeisance to his list that if asked to 
take off for a movie he answers with 
a vacant gaze because this is not on 
the list (Ed. see Friend of Infamy, p. 
2. paragraph I)
