In the street below, a bullock cart loaded 
with grain plods past the sugar cane 
crusher. The boys at the crusher feed the 
cane stalks through the press rapidly, 
turning out as much as they can. Dr. 
Khan and I are sitting at the table near 
the windows overlooking the street, pro-
longing breakfast tea, watching the 
people whose lives are not divided into 
weeks and who receive no benefit from 
the fact that today is Sunday. All day and 
all night every day, the street below this 
window is crowded, and thousands of 
lives flow past this window which frames 
a scene I have dubbed: the motion pic-
ture, "Bombay." Khanji and I are discus-
sing, as always, our two different worlds. 
"You mean there are no bullock carts 
at all in New York, not even in the poorer 
sections?" 
"It's just a different world. There's no 
real peasant culture. And god knows no 
domestic animals in the cities. You have 
to see it." 
"I would miss India," says Khanji, 
who is one of the few young Indian doc-
tors I have met who does not dream of 
moving to the States. Sun bathes the 
tenements across the street, where people 
live close with little privacy. A young 
woman on a balcony is tossing and comb-
ing her long black hair in the morning. 
We're off to Juju beach on "The magic 
bullock"-Khan's treacherous lambretta 
scooter that has had three flats in the past 
week. As a medical student on fellowship 
in India to learn about health-care sys-
tems, I am also learning about Indian 
hospitality and Indian transportation. 
One guarantees me an unending supply of 
attentive hosts, and the other ... at least a 
chance to be philosophical. We roll north 
through the city, along the edge of the 
Arabian Sea. On the sea side we pass a 
white mosque like a giant carving in 
ivory, with minarets and scallops above 
the windows-then a cove sheltering old 
fishing boats with sails curved like gull 
wings. But on our right is the city, and 
"hutments" of cloth or thatch or wood 
are pushed together on every margin of 
available land. When we pass a small pond 
where women are walloping wet clothes 
against the pavement, men are sun-
bathing in the sun, and little kids are 
defecating near the blooming lilies, I lean 
forward on the lambretta and shout 
above the wind into Khan's ear, 
"Bombay is the largest village in the 
world." 

When at last we arrive at the beach, I 
find myself grasping for a hold. The sub-
urbs through which we passed between 
the city and the beach, though new to 
me, seemed familiar: quiet streets, no 
hutments, small apartment buildings and 
private homes with Fiats parked in the 
driveways, palm trees towering above the 
mood of dust and comfort and silence. 
India, after all, is a name for a different 
view of the same round world. But now 
we are accosted by a woman and a child 
as we reach the sand. The woman wears 
the red-checked sari thrown over her right 
shoulder that shows her to be from 
Gujarat-a migrant to the city. She has no 
eyebrows. There are erratic pigment spots 
on her face. She has that slight rounding 
to her face, that slight flattening of her 
nose, that slight puffiness of her eyes, 
described as "Leonine." She and her child 
are begging, and I take note that her 
fingers and toes still look normal. 

Through the intended-to-embarrass din of 
her begging and her raucous caricature 
of humility, I have to remind myself over 
and over that the present sorrow is some-
times the best we can ever know. The 
woman has early leprosy. 

It is Sunday. We came here to go 
swimming. The leprous woman is almost 
instantly joined by dusky children hold-
ing up their hands, by men with monkeys 
on strings, vying for our attention and 
our coins. Who do you give your money 
to? How much? 

"Come on," says Khan, and we march 
through the food stands selling ice cream 
and spicy vegetables to the open beach. 
Warm sand worms intertoe. And we're in 
for a swim. I'm lucky. Salt water washes 
against me in rhythm, and the cold claws 
of the ocean wash away the heat and dust 
of our ride. 

We walk the beach; there are only 
handfuls of people dispersed thinly. 
Several monkey men wander aimlessly 
with no one to collect coins from. Two 
bearded men catch my eye. One is young 
and dark; the other is ancient, and he 
carries a brass pitcher of ocean water up 
the beach towards a pile of saffron cloth 
lying on the sand. Both men hunker 
down, naked except for loin cloths, 
warmed by the sun, muttering, tracing in 
the sand, sprinkling water. I would like to 
watch, but Khan clearly wants to leave 
them their privacy. 

"Your hippies," I kid him. 
"Not at all. How can you say that?" 
"Well ... They both follow a wandering 
life, with few demands ... They both place 
the ultimate values in their life on those 
experiences that transcend daily living." 
"These sadhus are the opposite of 
hippies." 

I am carried away, as if we are assess-
ing something I own: "Hippies are con-
sciously imitating Sadhus. They shake 
themselves awake from the dream. That's 
what the drugs are: an alarm clock. They 
want to sit up and see a reality that 
doesn't depend upon the rituals of con-
vention, that exists independently from 
specific conditions. Hippies want to be 
the Sadhus of the West." 
"That's the point, 'want to be.' These 
sadhus-or the real ones, anyway, not just 
the ganga addicts-are learned men. They 
don't disobey their parents; they don't 
take drugs and wander about with 
women; they go beyond the average men 
by discipline. And they are religious. This 
is their way of life. It is part of our coun-
try. They have not escaped from the 
rituals; they live them." 

Half the hippies are in India for the 
ganga, anyway. I know that. And I've 
heard Khan kid around about the Sadhus 
who live on ganga. And Khan is a Muslim, 
not a Hindu. I point out the tiny holes 
that pock the beach. A star-like pattern 
of sand grains extends out from each one. 
The mystery is solved when we see tiny 
sand crabs duck backwards into their 
holes as our shadows glide over them. I 
am thinking to myself: What can a hippie 
possibly say to the beggar woman whose 
toes will soon rot off? And what can they 
say to themselves? 

Sun and breeze match each other. It is 
perfectly comfortable; I feel part of the 
beach. With sudden delight, Khan points 
down: two large crabs, eight inches in 
diameter, are locked together and strug-
gling, claw on claw. Dr. Khan grabs each 
of them behind their front pinchers, and 
gently pulling, twisting, insisting, sepa-
rates them, and places them back on the 
sand. Watching him, I am reminded of his 
gentle force in the operating room. Sur-
prisingly, the two crabs neither scuttle 
away nor attack each other, but, with a 
strange swimming motion of their legs, 
they melt downward into the sand until 
only their sand-colored backs are un-
covered-yet perfectly blended with the 
beach. 

"Imagine how many we must walk 
over without being aware of it." 

As we look up, a flock of goats bobble 
past on their stick legs, ears flopping, 
ewes and kids led by the bearded. Two 
slender men in turbans walk behind. The 
scenario flows across the beach like a 
breeze. We watch, speechlessly, until 
goats and goatherds blend into the hori-
zon. As if resuming our breakfast conver-
sation, Khanji says, "This is what an 
Indian who settles in America would 
miss." 

Back at the beach house we have ice 
cream. Children approach us and hold out 
their hands pleading. I give away my 
coins and then the Gujarati woman with 
leprosy returns, hands outstretched. 
"This is what an Indian who settles in 
America would miss."
