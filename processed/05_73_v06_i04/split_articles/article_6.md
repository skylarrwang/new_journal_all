Station and seeing men I knew saying 
'power to the people; 'right on,'" says 
Trudeau. "It was self-serving, therapeutic 
rhetoric; it took on a whole life of its 
own ... and Mark became an unsympa-
thetic stereotype in direct parody of what 
went on." But Mark no longer is the 
self-indulgent activist; he has become 
more honest with himself, more aware of 
where a thoughtful radical may go after 
he comes down from the initial rush of 
activism. Trudeau has dropped the 
• "megaphone" before Mark's name--he 
hasn't used it in two years. 


Trudeau seems to feel that he himself 
has mellowed along with his characters. 
He is no longer the "man of extra-
ordinary inaction at mixers"; no longer 
just a member of the class of 1970: the 
class that threatened the stability of 
senior societies during Mayday; Inky 
· Oark's first class, the class that was told 
it would be "different from all the pre-
ceding classes." Trudeau seems to be a 
condensation of his characters, growing 
subtler, more complex, while still possess-
ing an incisive understanding of what is 
on peoples' minds. 


Perhaps some of the changes within 
Trudeau have been externalized in the 
character of Zonker Harris, one of the 
citizens of his Walden Commune who 
came into the strip two years ago as a 
tight end of the football team. "Zonker 
represents a very profound sense of char-
acter, a whole new sensitivity not in 
Mike," says Trudeau. "He's very fragile, . 
but he doesn't take himself seriously." 
Zonker seems unencumbered by social 
forces; he is concerned with the immedi-
ate environment. Very small things make 
up his fantasy world and he is easily 
bruised when someone takes them away. 
He feels a tremendous responsibility 
toward the animals around Walden (last 
Christmas he tried to convince a squirrel 
to hibernate) but never with any eco-
logical sense of duty. 


B.D. can yell at Zonker; it won't 
faze him. When he drops B.D.'s pass in 
the championship game and the team 
loses, B.D. hunts him down but Zonker 
finally meets him with a Christmas 
present. Trudeau thinks Zonker dropped 
the pass on purpose. 


For Trudeau, the comic strip has be 
cc.me a study of communication and lack 
of communication-among the characters 
themselves as well as among the char-
acters, the cartoonist, and the readel's. 
Last year he wrote a series on Bernie, a 
weird biology freak with a seven-year-old 
genius girlfriend who brings him egg salad 
sandwiches to calm his nerves during 
nitroglycerin experiments. Trudeau had 
Bernie walking around with an invisible 
ftle cabinet, the point being that Bernie 
deals with everything on an empirical 
level; he thinks everything can be fated. 
Trudeau's editor sent the strips back and 
told Trudeau that he just couldn't share 
those ideas with the rest of America. 


But Trudeau continues to be intrigued 
Hlll:r! 
stDf,'r, 
slltJOT· 
\ 
by the possibiJities of dialogue within the 
four-frame gag panel of conventional 
comic strips. 


He recognizes that all he has is a five-
second gag. Nevertheless, he constantly 
finds himself fighting against tempta-
tions to be superficial, to be ethnic for 
the sake of "relevance" (the original 
publicity for Doonesbury was "those 
campus cutups and the campus capers"). 
"You just have to be as honest as you 
can"-he says. "As soon as you become 
obsequious or 'relevant' you become dis-
honest." Trudeau never takes out or 
changes the names in his satires on com-
mercial products. At times, there are un-
predictable benefits to this policy: Mack 
trucks once sent him a gold-plated 
' phone handle with a Mack bulldog 
on it after he used their brandname in 
one comic strip. 


Although Trudeau says he does not 
want to be a cartoonist all his life, he has 
managed to get his cartooning down to a 
regular business schedule. He keeps six 
weeks ahead of his daily strip, working on 
his cartoons about fifteen hours a week 
· while being a freshman counselor and a 
student in graphic design at the Yale Art 
•and Architecture School. Two syndicates 
promote his strip at horne and abroad: it 
. now runs in about 200 papers in nine 
different countries. 


But working for the syndicates re-
mains a more volatile business for 
Trudeau than one might suspect. For one 
pung, there are 350 syndicated cartoons 
in the country and they are all in direct 
competition with each other-meaning 
that when your strip goes in a newspaper, 
someone else's goes out. It tends to be-
come a personal business rather quickly. 


For another thing, American cartoon 
strips tend to be conservative, usually 
three years behind the major social forces 
in society. So a social satirist like Trudeau 
is bound to stir a great deal of anxiety 
and emotions among newspaper editors. 


Occasionally, newspapers decide not to 
run his cartoons: The Los Angeles Times 
dropped his series on President Nixon 
visiting Watts; the Akron papers would 
not run his series on Kent State. And 
while Trudeau maintains that his cartoons 
are primarily of entertainment value, 
regardless of how political people think 
he is, he defends the right of a paper to 
drop (but never edit) his cartoons when it 
feels the subject matter is too contro-
versial. The most recent conflict for 
Trudeau rsulted from a series he wrote on 
former Presidential advisor John Ehrlich-
man. The series (part of which appears on 
these pages of The New JoU17Ulf) was 
written before the Watergate case had 
blown apart, but was scheduled to appear 
the first week in May , after the pre-
viously almost unheard of Ehrlichman 
became a well-known public figure . 
Trudeau had to scrap the entire series, 
although some of the strips will appear 
later in revised forms. With the Watergate 
proceedings still going on. Trudeau's 
subject is just too hot to handle right 
now-especially on top of his coming 
series about Zonker getting basted in 
Texas.e
