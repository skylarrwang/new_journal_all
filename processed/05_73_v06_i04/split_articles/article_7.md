An Interview by Andrew Elkind 
Standish Lawder's basement is a riot 
of miniature switches, wires and ustltu 
mechanical devices. It is also the work-
shop of a highly inventive independent 
filmmaker, and hidden among the wires 
and gadgets are full projection facilities, 
thousands of feet of film and a home-
made optical printer capable of infinit-
IJ 
111 a vast range of visual effects. 
Lawder's activities represent a high-
â€¢ntensity collage of film theory and prac-
tice. As a film theorist, he initiated the 
study of film at Yale, where he taught 
popular introductory courses in film 
history and experimental film. He is cur-
rently on leave from his position as 
Associate Professor of History of Art, and 
during the past year has served as the film 
Luke Professor of Film Studies at Har-
vard. As a filmmaker, Lawder has re-
ceived widespread recognition and nu-
merous prizes and awards for his films, 
among them Necrology, Dangling Parti-
ciple, Corridor and Raindance. With the 
aid of the Guggenheim Foundation and 
the American Film Institute, he will ex-
periment next year with 70 mm stereo-
scopic cinematography. 

As we began our conversation, Lawder 
leaned back in his chair and lit up a Gau-
loise. Surrounded by wires, adapters and a 
host of electromechanical servants, he 
spoke of the film process and the process 
of his own film-making. 

When you first get into film you have 
a general "man-on-the-street" working 
definition of what film is, and it cor-
responds pretty closely to "The Movies." 
The more you get into it, you find that 
some of the most extraordinary, exciting, 
powerful films are not movies at all. 
They're records, documents and experi-
ments. Anything and everything can go 
on film and it needn't be packaged 
along the lines of a dramatic structure of 
90 to 160 minutes. 

Film arrived before anybody knew 
what to do with it. There were no rules 
and it wasn't necessarily dramatic or 
comedy, or adventure or Western. It was 
just this magical recording device, and 
anything that was interesting, mysterious 
or sensational was fit subject matter. 
What you have, in fact, is experimental 
film. Filmmakers experimenting, trying 
to find situations that come alive most 
vividly on film. That first decade is full of 
fantastic stuff. 

My favorite is a film of 1903 called 
"Electrocuting the Elephant ... And that's 
exactly what happens, by God. It's about 
a minute long, terrible photographic qual-
ity, very flatly and gray, and the res-
toration is so bad it jittles all over the 
screen. But what happens is this: they 
lead out this enormous elephant and 
there is a long shot of him, head on. And 
you look at this elephant and he's chained 
up and suddenly clouds of smoke come up 
from his feet and this great bent col-
lapse and twitches--it's just an incredible 
piece of film.

In your own film-making, you've made 
explicit use of some of these remarkable 
pieces of found footage [shots and scenes 
taken directly from other films]. I'm 
thinking particularly of Dangling Parti-
ciple and Construction Job, which you 
constructed without using a camera at 
all. Film, more than any other art, 
seems to offer this opportunity for 
incorporating portions of pre-existing 
works into new products. 

Well, found footage filmmaking is 
roughly analogous to a process of collage 
or the art of assemblage, where the artist 
regards the entire visual information 
environment of secondary images: news-
papers, video, film and so forth. We're 
totally surrounded by images which refer 
to the real world but in themselves con-
stitute a kind of secondary and purely 
illusionistic arsenal. And they are as much 
a part of the environment as nature is. 

The use of this material, it seems to 
me, is perfectly valid. It's what a lot of 
artists in static media have done--select-
ing, arranging, editing, composing and so 
forth. All an artist does, it seems to me, is 
make decisions about what is in and what 
is out and at a very stupid, basic level this 
is the nature of his activity--though it 
doesn't explain why or what comes out 
of it. When I'm working with images, I 
don't make a distinction between a piece 
of film I've shot, somebody else has shot, 
somebody has shot for an entirely differ-
ent purpose, a piece of footage I shot a 
long time ago and am now using for an-
other purpose or an image that can be 
absolutely reworked by any number of 
systems. But of course I don't make films 
like most filmmakers. I don't go out into 
the real world with a camera, gather a lot 
of images, and then assemble them to tell 
a story about what was out there. That's 
just not my avenue. 

I've been working with film for a long 
time and in the process have accumulated 
an enormous stash of junk footage. 
People lay it on me all the time. They see 
my films and later come to me with a 
stack of films that came out of their 
grandparents' attic. I just tend to accumu-
late that stuff. 

I see two pretty distinct tendencies in 
your work. To a large extent your collage 
films function in terms of their inform-
ation content. But films like Corridor and 
Raindance work in an entirely different 
way. 

Yes, films such as Corridor or Rain-
dance operate in terms of energy. They 
also deal with information but it is infor-
mation in the communication engineer's 
sense of it, that is, items of sensory input, 
data, binary bit patterns, signal-value 
ratios. Which is another way of saying 
energy, right? And that has just been a 
large concern of mine for a long time--the 
way the eye and the mind can be stimu-
lated by forcing them into a situation of 
high-speed information processing, by 
implanting patterns of energy as power-
fully and rapidly as possibly. 

Haven't you been involved in a num-
ber of experiments which have explored 
aspects of the visual process? 

In 1960 I had just gotten out of 
Army, I was studying art history in Mu-
nich, and I met a remarkable, brilliant 
man named Dr. Max Knoll. He's been 
recognized by many people as being one 
of the most extraordinary creative minds 
of science in the twentieth century. 

Among his accomplishments was the 
invention, by and large, of the electron 
microscope. He did that way back in the 
20's and 30's, and then wandered off into 
other things. He was a physicist but also 
very interested in psychiatry, art, and a 
lot of other activities-- he was a very 
Faustian character. He was also very 
much a Jungian, and during the last ten 
years of his life was concerned with the 
concept of formal patterning, that is, 
images corresponding to archetypal con-
figurations inherent in some mental pro-
cess or structure of the brain. He investi-
gated enormous quantities of art of var-
ious sorts--folk art, primitive art, child-
ren's art, art of the insane, art of dreams--
in an attempt to categorize them accord-
ing to Jungian archetypal configurations 
of form. He began working with neuro-
physiologists at the Munich Mental 
Health Institute and discovered that when 
you passed carefully controlled, very low 
voltage pulses of electricity through the 
brain, it would excite visual patterns 
involuntarily. With your eyes closed, in a 
dark room, with black goggles on, with 
this electrical stimulation you could very 
clearly perceive patterns of light. And 
they took various forms according to--
well that was the question--according to 
what? According certainly to measurable 
factors like voltage control and wave 
configurations, amplitudes, but also 
apparently according to some sort of 
interface between that pulse and some 
characteristic of the circuitry of the 
brain, which varied according to 
different individuals. 

There's an issue here that really fasci-
nates me and is very close to film. If you 
regard film as a process, film starts with 
the real world, then, it's put on celluloid 
and processed through various machines 
and finally ends up on a strip that goes 
through a projector. But it doesn't stop 
there--it goes onto the screen and comes 
back into your eye. So there is a total 
circuit of connections. It has to do with 
how the eye thinks, and how the brain 
sees, and how you accommodate images 
and how you process that visual infor-
mation. 

While I was working on Raindance, I 
became involved with an experiment that 
was being developed over at Connecticut 
Mental Health Center by two psychia-
trists, Dr. George Henniger and Dr. Walt 
Brown, who are interested in the use of 
film to generate emotions within a con-
trolled clinical (experimental) situation. 
The experiment was, primarily to moni-
tor the physiological responses that ac-
company emotion which is, in this case, 
triggered by film. 

They were attempting to identify 
precisely what takes place in the body, in 
the mind, when we experience fear, de-
pression, anxiety and so forth. They went 
through the entire system of monitors 
that medicine has developed--
electroencephalograms, analysis of blood 
chemistry, simple things like respiration, 
heart beat, galvanic skin response ... 

Anyway, they called me up and asked 
me for suggestions on films that would 
trigger emotions. I started working with 
them on this project and I was fascinated 
by it, because it conformed pretty closely 
to a view of film that I have. I see a film 
as a phenomenon that really gets inside 
your mind, inside your body, and does 
things to you. That's what is interesting 
about film. Why is it we react with de-
light, fear, apprehension, fascination, 
whatever, by looking at this pattern of 
light and objects and images? 

When I was working on Corridor I got 
interested a lot in the potential interface 
between film as an energy system and the 
central nervous system and particularly 
the way in which--or the extent to which--
film as a system of pulses of energy could 
interlock and could drive the brain into 
an alpha wave mode. 

That brought me back full circle to 
those experiments I had been working on 
a decade ago. I saw their laboratory as a 
check-out station for some of these ideas. 
I gave them a print of Raindance and 
worked with subjects, wiring them up and 
reading from the polygraph which came 
out of the electroencephalogram. I found 
it quite amazing that here is a system 
which gives you a kind of instant readout, 
a graph, a chart, of exactly what is hap-
pening. It records very directly what is 
happening very immediately. 

One very specific goal in Raindance 
was the exploration of illusionary color--
the way the eye will perceive colors that 
are not on the screen, colors that come 
about through after-images or through 
retinal mixing. And to check out the 
energy level of the brain as it accommo-
dates and processes that information at 
that precise moment, just seems to me 
really interesting. 

The funny thing about those experi-
ments is that they simply confirmed my 
intuitions in the making of the film. I, 
frankly, did not find them very helpful as 
a source of information which informed 
my decisions--they simply told me I was 
on the right track and when I thought 
interesting things were happening, damn 
it, they were. 

Raindance is a very demanding film. 
The first time I saw it I was bored and got 
a headache. But I found it extraordinarily 
interesting--and much more enjoyable--
on second viewing. 

Part of that problem is that we think 
so little about how we are thinking when 
we watch a film that we react to the film 
automatically according to a backlog of 
conditioned experience. 

Now in a film like Raindance, ques-
tions--like where are we going? how is this 
going to end?--very often blanket out a 
perception of the fundamental experience 
of the film itself. Not where is it going or 
what is going to happen but rather--what 
is happening. Most films engage the mind 
primarily through suspense. We wonder 
about how they're going to turn out, how 
this character is going to develop, how 
the plot will work out, how the loose 
ends are coming together. We are actively 
engaged in the film by speculating on its 
resolution. 

That conditioned experience which we 
call "The Movies" has for so long been 
defined in terms of this fundamental 
question: what is going to happen? In-
stead of what is happening. But there are 
other films, like Raindance, that you can 
only get the barest glimpse of the first 
time through. In the first screening you're 
wondering about what is going to happen 
instead of being able to pay attention to 
what is happening. 

"Movies" are intended to function 
primarily within an entertainment situa-
tion. Film, as movies, are defined pri-
marily as one-shot situations. They ex-
haust themselves the first time through, 
they're expendable commercial com-
modities. Now I don't think that need 
be, or at least that doesn't particularly 
interest me. I'm interested very much in a 
lot of films that I want to look at again 
and again and again. You see more and 
more each time, you learn more and 
more each time, you learn more about 
your own process and pattern of percep-
tion each time. This seems to me a 
fairly fundamental redefinition of 
film and of course it is closer to a tra-
dition of painting, a much more serious 
tradition of art. That is, something 
that renews itself each time, reveals 
more of itself each time, and is in fact 
a matrix, a layer of information, sen-
sations, evocations and ideas that cannot 
be perceived the first time. 

Isn't there a problem getting people to 
see a film more than once? 

It seems to me that's a problem of film 
distribution, a problem that's built into a 
tradition of film exhibition, rather than 
being a fundamental fact of the medium 
itself. I think a more important fact of 
film is the extraordinary richness of the 
medium itself. After all, it can be worked 
with in a way that the experience quite 
literally becomes new on second and 
third and fourth viewing. A film that is 
rich enough, or strong enough, doesn't 
exhaust itself the first time. 

I really liked the short animation se-
quence at the beginning of Raindance. 
Where did you get that footage? 

It's from a British animation film, 
called, I think kind of appropriately, 
"The History of Cinema," a little cartoon 
of a classroom or instructional film on 
the history of cinema. I was looking at it
