One nlaht In the aprlna of 1967, 
Carry Trudeau ut down to write a comic 
atrlp for Th1 R1cord, Yale'a humor maa· 
azlne, whoae humor waale11 eluaJve Jn 
thoae daya. It wu a frlvoloua Idea. He 
had al~ya wanted to be a writer, not a 
cartoonlat. Yet he waalntrlaued with 
the drawlnp of Jules Peiffer, particularly 
with one character named 11Bernard," 
a little neb blah who apent a areat deal of 
hli time feelina-lnadequate. Trudeau waa 
a freahman; the battle crlea of Davenport 
mlxen were clear In hla mind. 

Trudeau flnlahed the atrlp In four 
houra. It wu terrible. The charactera 
were 
11atyllzed, the art waa bad." He put 
1t away for a year. After a sophomore 
year marked by frustration and a acn10 
of aelf·trapdy, Trudeau picked up hla 
aketchea apln. He boaan to develop the 
charactera of Mike "tho Man" Dooneabury 
and B.D., a football quarterback/myth

"The conundrum of l~fe is how

that, it's often nice to spena a

I' 
qulnteaaentlal Yallea, Mike the Man and 
B.D., appeared the next fall In a Yalt 
Dtllly N1w1 comic atrlp called bull ta/11. 
It waalmmedlatoly popular, and by the 
time the Dowllna·Hlll ora ended, the 
quarterback hlmaclf would write: "Jt aot 
to the point where J waa anxloua to aee 
what I had done the day before. I even 
became hesl,ant to ao on a road trip untU 
laaw what 'bullta/11 movea• to uae at 
one of our aliter achoola." 

When Trudeau araduated and trana-
formed bull ta/11 Into the lnttrnatlonally 
ayndlcated Doont~bury comic atrlp, many 
Yallea continued to claim him for Yale 
before Cod and Country. That Trudeau 
waa aood aa a ayndlcated cartoonlat waa 
never In queatlon; the point of contention 
. waa whether Trudeau had taken the edae 
orr hla humor by broadenlna the acope · 
of hla comlca to appeal to a mau audience. 
It Ia a aubtle and aore point for many who 
jealoualy suard bulltfflll aa part of the 
Yale Experience. After all, who but a 
Yale man could r1ally appreciate the 
fruatratlona and fantaalea of Mike the Man 
Dooneabury? 1t waa too cloae to home. 

He eontlnuea to draw on Yale for hls 
material, but hla characters-even B.D.·· 
have loat their major tlca to Yale. Hla 
problem Ia no lonaer to expreu the 
aenalbllltlea of pre-coeducation Yale men, 
but to broaden atereotypea Into charae-
tera, to explore the posalbllltlea of Jan· 
auaae, and to defy momentary conaldera· 
tlon··to create a comlc atrlp that capturea 
the attention and lmaaJnatlon of the 
predominantly non-Yale readen who rip 
throuah the comlca section every day. 

On the one hand, Trudeau doean't want 
to be a cartoonJat all hla life. Cartoonists 
are a very Jnarown aroup whote aole paa-
alon uaually la cartoonlna; that's why they 
don't object to obacenely lona contracta. 
Trudeau wUI be dolna Doont~bury until 
he Ia at lout 34. That wu the ahorteat 
contract he could pt. On the other hand, 
he conaldera It a prlvlleae to be able to 
alt down at the drawlna board every day 
and work out hla fantaalea before 18 
mllljon readen. 


Garret B. Trudeau, as he is hardly ever 
called, has always thrived on a strong 
heritage of fantasy. His formative years 
were spent on a farm in New York-- "it 
was a real Christopher Robin existence. 
I was well schooled in fantasy and Beatrix 
Potter." He feels that his early experience 
instilled him with a profound respect for 
nature. One of his most poignant mem-
ories was the Faulknerian test of his 
manhood: a caribou hunt in New-
foundland. 

After four days of rain and misery, 
Trudeau canoed into a cove, the skies 
parted and a lone caribou walked out into 
the clearing. It was a God-sent vision. 
Trudeau killed it, only with a great deal 
of anguish. He has not hunted since. 

Trudeau has had endless fantasies con-
cerning his own athletic prowess, and has 
played out a lot of these fantasies with 
Brian Dowling, although the two never 
were friends and neither has any real 
impression of the other. Trudeau remem-
bers being amazed as he watched Dowling 
one day weaving in and out of cars speed-
in~ down Elm Street. Another day he 
spted on Dowling cashing a check at the 
Co-op. The only time they actually met 
was when Trudeau came to Dowling's 
room to pick up the quarterback's intro-
duction to the ftrst collection of bull 
tales. The conversation went something 
like this: 

Dowling: I really enjoy your cartoons. 
Where did you get the idea to do some-
thing like that? 
Trudeau: Oh, l don't know, where did 
you get the idea to play football? 

And that was about it. 

The critical point in Trudeau's career 
seems to have been the summer before his 
junior year at Yale. He had spent most of 
the previous year mourning the end of a 
romance; his confidence was low. Toward 
the end of the Spring term, he got to-
gether with three friends, one of whom 
began to mention casually the idea of · 
putting out a magazine during the sum-
mer, in say, Washington, D.C. Things got 
serious. The idea was to start a tri-lingual 
magazine (English-French-Spanish) for 
the diplomatic corps in Washington. Sort 
of a New York magazine, pointing out 
the positive aspects of Washington life for 
those of foreign cultures. They split up 
the assignments. Then they took an Al-
legheny flight down to the Capital to 
investigate the magazine's prospects, the 
three of them in jackets and ties and 
white shirts--Trudeau in a pink shirt; he 
was the art director. They researched 
their assignments, flew back to New 
Haven, typed up reports, and made final 
plans. 

That summer--while the Poor People's 
campaign and Resurrection City scared 
people away from Washington-the four 
of them put out a 24-page bi-weekly 
magazine. They slept three hours a night. 
Collectively, they lost 70 pounds. One 
night, when the publisher had decided to 
Volume six, number four I May 18, 197316 
take a short nap, he was awakened with, 
"Bruce, it's time for dinner ... " and 
promptly bolted up, saying "Dinner, 
dinner, file under D." 

Gra phicatly, the magazine wasn't 
great. But the four were caught up in the 
spirit and the process; by the end of the 
summer they had 85 volunteers working 
for them. Trudeau returned to Yale with 
confidence, despite the fact that one of 
his friends owed-and still owes-him $400. 

The bull tales that began appearing the 
next fall were simple, formula- oriented: 
Doonesbury (at a mixer, dancing with 
a girl, smile on his face), thinking: Well, 
here I am at my first mixer, and quite 
obviously about to score. It won't be long 
before we start on up to my room. 
(Tall upperclassman comes over.) 
Upperclassman: Hey Frosh! What do 
you say you go take a look at the new 
Coke machine! 
Doonesbury: Oh yeah, sure. That's 
rich ... the Coke machine·, right, the new 
Coke ~chine, that's a laugh, ha, ha. 
Doonesbury (alone, on his knees, 
looking at the Coke machine): Actually, 
it's quite tricky the way it works. 
(Actually, this was one of a few true 
incidents Trudeau adapted for his strips. 
It happened to his freshman roommate, 
only it was a milk machine.) 

The characters were archetypal. The 
women were merely props for Mike's 
frustrations. The quality of the draw" 
iilg was only fair, sometimes inconsistent. 
Often, he didn't draw in the mouths of 
characters and continued not to do so 
until one day he got a letter from a man 
in San Fransisco who enclosed a whole 
batch of Doonsbury cartoons with the 
mouths of characters drawn in. "You 
see how much better they are," he wrote. 
But bull tales was entertaining--and at 
a sobering place like Yale, where self-
flagellation occasionally hits peaks like 
Mayday, 1970--it was a welcome relief. 

Some people may have criticized him for 
modelling his drawings after Feiffer and 
his reader-character interactions after 
Schultz's Peanuts, but the verdict remain-
ed: Trudeau was capturing the sensibility 
and mood of Yale with an incisive humor; 
people were waiting for The Yale Daily 
News, wondering if bull tales would be 
good today. 

Since Trudeau first began writing 
about Michael J. Doonesbury, there has 
been a constant but unconscious evolu-
tion in the character of Mike the Man. 
Doonesbury still experiences many of the 
same anxieties, but no longer in hyper-
bolic ways. He is m\lch calmer, much 
more able to deal with the world. He has 
mellowed. "I've found whole new ways 
of being rejected," says Trudeau, "far less 
simplistic." 

Trudeau's campus radical, (Mega-
phone) Mark Slack meyer, has also mel-
lowed. •1'he original Mark was my super-
ficial reaction to going through Yale
