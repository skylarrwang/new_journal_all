EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
one night--Ilook at a Jot of fJ.Jms like that 
with the sound off, because the sound 
gets in the way if you're interested in the 
image. I liked that one sheet of rain that 
came down, I liked its pattern, I liked its 
gesture, I liked the counterpoint of the 
busy activity of the raind!ops with that 
rather beautiful sweep of the wipe. So 
when I first saw 1t I jumped up and stop-
ped the projector and took that film and 
printed out that one little piece. Then I 
looped it and started playing with it, 
printing it on high contra_st and adding 
color and alternating negative and po-
sitive frames and doing all those things 
that went into the making of Raindance. 
I worked on Raindance for a year. 
First of all I didn't know where I was 
going. Quite literally, I would work in 
that film by taking a piece of footage, 
inspecting it, speculating on what was 
interesting about that particular segment 
and asking myself now if that's good, 
what's next? And then I would combine 
it with something else or add some color 
or change something. I'd make decisions 
-like a painter does when he's got this 
picture in front of him--he keeps changing 
and adding and subtracting and rework-
ing. And after so many decisions of lhis 
sort I finally decided that eventually it 
was finished. I had spent a Jot of money, 
and in the end, had absolutely no idea if 
anybody was interest in looking at it. But 
happily that film has been very good to 
me. In one year it has paid for itself in 
festival prizes alone. 


Are you working on any more energy 
films like Rain dance and Corridor? 
No, I'm not doing things like that now. 
I was very glad I got into that film, but 
I'm not interested right now in those 
problems or in working in that style. I'm 
shifting back more to film as information, 
film as a process of inspection. 


What projects are you working on 
now? 
It's hard to say what I'm working on. 
There are a good dozen films that I don't 
know whether I'm working on or whether 
they're abandoned. If they never get 
done, then I guess they're abandoned. 
I work primarily with ideas and the 
only way for me to t1nd out if an idea 
really works is to check it out-to shoot 
it. That room and cabinets there and in 
the back room are piled high with footage 
that I never made into a fmished film. I'm 
just cluttered up with dead-end projects. 
Some !...!''- - ~;d finish. Some are good and 
I just haven't gotten around to them. All 
this is very expensive, but I regard it as 
absolutely fundamental as a kind of 
research and development. In order to 
keep thinking about what works on film 
and what doesn't, I've got to keep work-
irlg and when I get a good idea I've got to 
stop all the other ideas and just chase that 
one and check it out. 


I'm working on a couple of films that 
are ideas that have been suggested by 
what my optical printer is capable of 
doing. I'm doing animated streak optical 
zooms. That means that the camera, 
mounted on a motor-driven platform, will 
physically move toward the image with 
the shutter open. Each frame is going to 
be blurred through the movement of the 
camera towards the image and it will be 
like zooming-- you'll have these streaks of 
light converging or radiating out from 
central points. It creates very interesting 
spacial distortions of the image. Very 
controlled, carefully set-up situations 
usirlg that piece of machinery. That's 
generally how I work, anyway. First I 
build the machirle and then I decide what 
to do with it. 


There are a couple of very large pro-
jects that may or may not ever get done. 
They really should get done because I've 
invested a lot of money in them and a Jot 
)f footage. I've got a number of docu-
nentaries that represent several thousand 
reet of color that just need to be cut and 
maybe I'U do that next year. 


I didn't know you had any interest in 
doing a documentary. 


Well, I decided at one point that I 
wanted to make a documentary and I 
started thinking about what a documen-
tary film is and what we look at and what 
we enjoy and what makes good docu-
mentaries good. Obviously it's a matter 
not only of the treatment but also the 
selection of the topic. So I started think-
irlg about that and came up with a near 
perfect solution which, as curious as it 
sounds, is baton twirling. 


I discovered that there is a massive 
sub-culture in this country of baton-
twirlers. All across the country in back 
yards, in little towns, there are thousands 
and thousands and hundreds of thousands 
of little girls who dedicate their lives to 
baton twirling. 1 had had a mistaken un-
derstanding of what baton twirling was, 
seeirlg it only at its J'TIOre public displays 
such as Memorial Day paraaes and foot-
ball halftime intermissions. That's not 
the business at aiL Baton twirlirlg is a 
highly organized, highly competitive 
activity. There are on any given weekend, 
all over the country, local and state and 
regional competitions. And this is the 
real stimulus and it's the coordirlating 
structure of the activity. The National 
Baton Twirling Association is' the second 
Volume six, number four I May 18, 1973110 
largest girl"s youth organization in the 
country, after Girl Scouts, and they take 
this business very, very seriously. 


Once I discovered this, it became very 
clear that here is absolutely the ideal sub-
ject for a documentary film. Check it out. 
It's got color, it's got spectacle, it's got 
human interest, it's grassroots Americana. 
It is this enormous cultural phenomenon 
that nobody knows anything about. It's 
got grace and beauty and movement that 
on film are even more so. 


I got some money for this from the 
Kaltenborn Foundation and I went with 
a crew and filmed 2500 feet at the Na-
tional Baton Twirling Competition out irl 
St. Paul, Minnesota four vears ago. I had 
:-.nother 2000 feet shot at the Rose Bowl 
that year. I also shot a lot of local 
twirlers and teachers of twirling. 


This twiriirlg footage I have is just out 
of sight,just extraordinary. It represents 
an infinitely complex folk art, somewhere 
between gymnastics, dance, and athletic 
activity. It requires the kind of fanatical 
dedication which is part of the reason 
why children are so good at swimming, 
because they haven't learned that there's 
more to life than swimming non-stop for 
four hours a day. But, unlike swimming 
which is purely an athletic activity, this 
isn't an issue of a matter of talent, it's a 
matter of dexterity. What they do with 
that glistening chrome dildo ... 


This material is such a joy to look at 
on film. I have a lot of sync-sound inter-
views with mothers and twirling coaches 
and executive officers of the twirling 
organizations, and of course they take it 
all very seriously. At first, I was thinking 
irl terms of how ridiculous this is and how 
wide open it is for satire, but I came 
around a good deal. I really got very fond 
of the people, knowing and seeing how 
much it meant to them. I mean, it is 
ultimately a frivolous activity, but, on the 
other hand, somebody who is that dedi-
cated and can focus attention that pre-
cisely and work that hard on something--
there's something to be said for it. 


Well that's one film that I ought to 
just sit down and finish, the material is so 
good. That's the biggest block of material 
I have on documentary film. There are a 
couple of other documentary films that 
someday I ought to finish up. One is on 
the Oldenberg lipstick given to the Uni-
versity in the spring of '69. 


I understand tho' you've been awarded 
some grants. What sort of filmmaking do 
you plan to be doing? 


Well, it's a big block of time-it's 
fifteen months free of teaching and free 
from any other academic entanglements 
at either Harvard or Yale. I've got a 
Guggenheim grant for the year, and just 
recently I landed another $10,000 grant 
from the American Film Institute to help 
with production expenses. I've been 
tooling up for the project and I've done 
my homework in theory and practice. 


It's going to be devoted to experiments 
in 70 mm stereoscopic cinematography. 
I've been aware of this phenomenon-
that of stereo film--for a long time, and 
have been shooting in it and playing with 
it since 1967 or so, when I bought a 
crude stereo rig for my 8olex. And that 
16 mm SJStem was enough to convince 
me that here, at last, is a virgin art 
enormously rich in expressive potential 
that literally nobody has seriously looked 
at or played with or explored. 


What I'll be doing are the kinds of 
things in films that I think I'm good at. 
I'm good at thinkirlg up and designing 
machinery to handle the process. I'm 
pretty good at thinking through the 
machinery towards those ideas that are 
best expressed with it. This is a kind of 
film-making that requires very close 
attention to the frame and to composi-
tion and to the image. Indeed, stereo 
really works only that way. If you just 
shoot normal situations and events in 
stereo there are all sorts of problems 
which in regular film are ordinary conven-
tions of seeing. But in stereo they become 
problems. For example, in film the movie 
screen is always seen as a flat surface with 
"'> 
an illusion of depth behind it, like a win-
dow. 


ln stereo you're not looking at a flat 
photographic image. You're looking lit-
erally at objects. let me give you an 
example of the sort of problems I'm talk-
irlg about. If you sit in the front row, to 
the side, m a movie theater, you'll get an 
enormously distorted image, and if there's 
a large close-up of a head on the screen, 
the head will be onion-shaped, it will 
stretch out towards you. You don't see 
it as onion-shaped, you see it as a head 
and you make those corrections. Now, 
if you take that same shot in stereo you 
will look at a man whose head is, in fact, 
shaped like an onion. 


I don't know exactly what I'm going 
to be doing, but there are a number of 
situations that I'm thinking of, that I 
want to explore. What I come up with 
will not necessarily be narrative but more 
situational. Since what you see is phys-
ically there, the meaning is going to come 
from why it's there. There are a lot of 
films that stereo simply will not help, 
and its overwhelming sensation of the 
physical presence will exhaust itself pretty 
quickly. But if you involve events and 
people in some sort of compelling situa-
tion that has its own inner logic and 
structure, it can be pretty excitin~.
