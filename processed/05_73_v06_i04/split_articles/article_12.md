It is also wide open to optical marup-
ulations that I think I can engineer through 
optical printing of the stereo image that 
will permit fantastic transformations. 

Just to start with: double exposures, 
layers, several images stacked in space, 
each operating differently, sometimes . 
floating in and out of each other, some-
times separating--that kind of thing. 

Very simple to do. It's not at all simple, 
but I can do it. 

Or, for example, working with travel-
ing matts. If I shoot in stereo, say a man 
·against a totally black background, what 
you see is this man walking, or singing, 
or dancing, or whatever, and his figure 
is brilliantly lit and is totally white, so 
you have this figure of white light 
moving and walking in front of you, 
right? Okay. If you take that piece of 
film, which is a white cut-out, in space, 
and print it together with let's say foot-
age of a pan shot moving along a brick 
wall and combine those two together, 
what you'll have is this improbable but 
tangibly real image of a figure in space 
moving with gestures--very clearly a figure, 
but the image formed out of a brick wall. 
And then to print that with animated-
streak optical zooms, and to have him 
disappear down into himself. Magritte 
is the closest in painting to the kinds of 
ideas that I'm speculating on and ca£1 
happen in stereo, I think. 

Wlu!· I'll end up with is not something 
that is distributable. It will be very much 
a kind of concert situation where I have 
to adjust the entire viewing, screening 
situation. I'm thinking most of aJI rear 
screen which imparts a very different 
quality to the image. Another even more 
important aspect of my stereo work in-
volves an adjustable inter-ocular separa-
tion of the images. That is one part of 
the whole process that nobody has worked 
with at all. The assumption has been that 
stereo is a rendering of the three-dimen-
sional world according to clues in space 
that are determined by binocular vision. 
The eyes are about 2~ inches apart, so 
if you put lenses that far apart, you read 
in space. But if you design the cameras 
so that those eyes can be moved farther 
out, what that does is enormously mag-
nify it, stretching space. Then, by re-
photography on the optical printer, you 
can do all sorts of miniturization effects. 
You can have little , tiny people hanging 
in space, moving way out and way back 
and things like that. I think it's a very 
rich, wide open, and fascinating art. 

I've got a whole notebook of ideas. But 
most of the ideas will come from the pro-
cess and checking out ideas and seeing 
what works and what doesn't and just 
following my nose. e
