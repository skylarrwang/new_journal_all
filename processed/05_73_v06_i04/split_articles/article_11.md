EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
proto-Absurdist dramatist Jarry-1 would 
have had to take my leave of him bowing, 
walking backwards, and calling him "your 
transcendency," because ot his high rank 
in the cult. I decided it would be better 
not to. They thanked me much for 
coming. I tried my best to say the right 
things. 

I went out the multi-locked door, took 
the lift down. and ran for a cab to Orly. 
That )WS 196 7. Since then I have 
appeared in two other lonesco plays, and 
directed still another. I wrote an earlier 
version of this article for The New Journal 
that managed to get quoted and refe"ed 
to in other publications, and an Australian 
professor, Richard N. Coe, has seen fit to 
publish a picture of me as a nearly-nude 
rhinoceros in the British edition of his 
study of lonesco. As a result of all this, I 
too now have a steadily -growing collec-
tion of miniature rhinoceroses. 

Before /left his apartment six Augusts 
ago, lonesco told me to keep in touch. I 
have, but sparingly; I don't want to push 
it. I write him infrequently and here-
sponds promptly. I spent a year in 
France, but only took up the oft-repeated 
open invitation to visit a couple of tjmes. 
Ionesco thrives on contradictions. No 
interview with him, no pronouncement 
oy him :.hould be laken too seriously; he 
will take pains to gainsay it the next time 
around. The second time I saw him he 
looked thinner, he sounded sadder, and 
he didn't laugh. A new black rhino had 
found its way into the living room, and 
squatted staring at us from the floor. 

From his balcony he had watched the 
riots of 1968 bring France to a standstill, 
yet de Gaulle, .. an inadvertent Pata-
physician," had squeaked his way out of 
it. Vietnam and the world's reaction to it 
were tearing everything apart, and he 
wanted to know about it. Beckett had 
written the play lonesco had joked 
about-Breath, which Kenneth Tynan (an 
arch-enemy of lonesco) had perverted 
into the prologue for Oh, Calcutta. Hun-
ger and Thirst.had played at a professional 
summer theatre in Massachusetts (an 
•• American Premiere," according to their 
publicity) with the new fowth episode in 
place of the old second, and nobody 
much liked any of it. He has written no 
new episodes. Grotowski is now the rage. 
Mme Ionesco has seen him, but he hasn't. 
I tell him all I know-their new approach 
to the physical training of the actor, and 
the new approach to the text: the play-
wright is unimportant, the words are 
intoned, not spoken with regard to their 
literal meaning. He puzzles, he questions, 
and then he stops: "But, still and all, it's 
...ery difficult to write a text for the the-
atre." 

For many critics, Ionesco's frrst plays 
were his best. They shocked the theatre 
world and then, after a while, they were 
understood, and stayed that way. But he 
went on writing, and changed. Though his 
first theatrical acts had been radical, 
revolutionary, his credentials lapsed. He 
saw himself as anti-totalitarian, anti-
political; he was seen as reactionary. His 
place in the history of the drama was 
assured, but he continued to live and 
write, and what he wrote often embar-
rassed people for his sake, and even en-
dangered the esteem he had won years 
before. Ionesco seems to be constantly 
aware of this current, as if his silence, his 
death, would be accepted by the world as 
an act of discretion. Yet he seems to 
prefer a life of writing to eternal ftxity in 
a pantheon, and so he continues. 

And then I phone him again, and he's 
ebullient. "How are things at Yale? Have 
they turned it into a shoe factory yet? I 
hear from Harvard that it'll happen any 
day now." He has only half an hour, but 
he invites me over and stretches it to two. 
I return to Yale, to the Drama School. 
Here in the States Ionesco is taught-far 
more than he is in France--and his earlier 
plays are produced, but he hardly seems 
to be a contemporary playwright. There 
hasn't been a major New York produc-
tion for years. 

In 1970 I hear he has written a new 
play ,Jeux de massacre. I ask about it, he 
sends me an autographed copy, and I try 
to get Dean Brustein interested in it. I 
don't get far. After a while it gets pro-
duced in Washington, to no great acclaim. 
When I first heard of Macbett, well 
over a year ago, I didn't even bother 
mentioning it. But Alvin Epstein, who 
was beginning to assume his duties as 
Acting Artistic Director of the Yale Rep-
ertory Theatre, heard about it and was 
excited by what he heard. Brustein was 
enthusiastic about the idea of premiering 
Edward Bond's Lear at the Rep, so Mac-
bell sounded like a good companion-
piece. Very softly, very gently, I leaped 
in. I wrote lonesco for information, I got 
reports on the Paris production, I got 
hold of a script, wrote up a scene-by-
scene synopsis, and made a rough trans-
lation of a couple of scenes. Epstein and 
literary Manager Michael Feingold read 
the French text and loved it. I just hoped, 
but didn't push. (I couldn't be objective 
about it anyway). 

Ionesco, however, 
hadn't answered my inquiries, so in early 
May we decided to phone him. The top 
brass of th~ Repertory Company gathered 
in the Dean's office as we waited for the 
transatlantic connection to be made. I 
couldn't resist;just as lonesco was about 
to get on the line I covered the mouth-
piece and said to Brusteirt "Quick! How 
do you say •Hello' in French?" A pall fell 
over the room. 

lonesco was as friendly and helpful as 
he could be, but the news was not en-
couraging; he had just sold all English-
language rights to a producer in London. 
He would see what he could do. Before 
saying goodbye he startled me: 
"Thanks," he said, .. for being interested 
in me." 

Through the summer and fall we dealt 
with London , trying to get the rights. All 
Ionesco knew of the Rep was what I told 
Volume six, number four I May 18, 1973114 
him, but he wrote that he would insist 
that if the Londoners didn't take up their 
option to premiere the play they should 
let us do it. 

For months there was no word. We 
put Macbett as late in the season as pos-
sible, in the seventh slot, right before 
Lear. As the months of silence wore on 
and hope wore out we looked for a play 
to fill the slot: something small, prefer-
ably a four- character play, as Lear was an 
enormous undertaking that would need 
extra weeks of rehearsal (overlapping the 
weeks reserved for Production 7) and 
would require the full energies of the 
Company. Just days before we were going 
to announce another play for the seventh 
slot a telegram came from London. It was 
ours. 

Macbett was a strairt on the Company, 
but they seemed to love it. Weeks before 
it went into rehearsal there was already 
enormous effort to re-focus the script in 
the places where it would be meaningless 
to American"audiences (or where the 
directors--Epstein, Bill Peters, and John 
McAndrew-thought it was weak) and to 
plan in detail the set, costumes, and ac-
tion. 

During the weeks of rehearsal I had 
virtually nothing to do with the produc-
tion; I had to pass my doctoral orals. I 
felt--unreasonably, no doubt--as if I had 
been separated from my baby. But when 
I finished my orals and got back to re-
hearsals-the week before opening-1 was 
delighted. The Company's Jove and work 
and directors' feeling for the play were 
already stamped upon the production. 

There were still problems, though, 
esi'Ccially with the ending. The directors 
had felt that Ionesco's ending was cold 
and flat , but they knew that theirs had 
the same problem. So we examined the 
script. 

The play deals with the continual 
circularity of evil. It posits a state in 
which the ruler, no matter who he is, 
will do evil. Glamiss and Cander ful-
minate against the tyranny of Archduke 
Duncan but, though their rebellion fails, 
it is obvious that their rule would have 
been no better than his. Macbett and 
Banco, the generals who have commanded 
the archducal armies in the suppression of 
the rebellion, change their minds and rail 
against Duncan by repeating Glamiss' and 
<..:ander's accusations word tor word. 
Their rebellion succeeds, but the state is 
no better off for it; in place of one mur-
derer on the throne, the state now has a 
committee of mwderers. Nor does Mac-
bett's murder of Banco help things in any 
way. An avenger appears--Macol-but at 
the end of the play he announces quite 
clearly that his rule will be the worst yet. 
In Ionesco's ending the populace one 
by one leave the stage during Macol's 
last speech. A fog covers the stage and a 
butterfly-chaser-a figure of absurd, de-
tached hope- crosses the stage, as he had 
done irt the first act. But in the Yale 
production the butterfly- chaser was out 
of the question; the directors hadn't like 
him from the start, so they had cut him 
out of the play. Besides, the populace in 
lonesco's version was showing an un-
characteristic discernment; throughout 
the play they had enthusiastically em-
braced every tyrant who came along, so 
why should they now withhold their 
favors from Macol? 

A new idea was hammered out; the 
populace would cheer Macol toward the 
ings and then freeze. Two of the aU-but-
faceless peasants would detach themselves 
from the crowd and repeat a fragment of 
the railing-against-the-tyrant dialogue that 
Glamiss and Cander and then Macbett 
and Banco had spoken. They then rejoin 
the mob, which unfreezes and cheers 
Macol's coronation off the stage. 

The directors worried about the new 
ending. They asked me if it wasn't doing 
violence to the playwright's intentions. 
But I liked it; it completed the circle 
already suggested by the text, it preserved 
the sense of a steadily deepening evil-a 
downward spiral, really, rather than a 
circle--yet it kept alive the absurd spirit of 
hope--through laughter, if nothing else. I 
remembered lonesco's appreciation of the 
Dramat's rewrite of the last episode of 
Hunger and Thirst, and I advised them to 
go ahead. 

Later I remembered something else. 
lhe last time I saw lonesco was in Au-
gust, 1969, at his apartment. After we 
had chatted for a while he got ready to go 
out for an appoirttment. As his wife 
helped him put on his jacket, I caught a 
glimpse of a button on the underside of 
his lapel. I asked him to show it to me. It 
said: H H H in '68; I asked him if he had 
been for Humphrey. 
"No," he said, .. 1 didn't really like 
either of them. One is as bad, as ugly as 
the other." He laughed, said goodbye, 
and headed for the lift.e
