**Title: The Accused**
**Author: Joel Krieger**
**Page number(s): 11-12**

"No doubt you are each aware of the 
documents placed before us for scrutiny 
in this case. which though not above the 
ordinary. are not wholly beyond our 
interest. I suspect we are close to deter-
mining the guilt of the Accused, by pro-
fession an Historian, of the name N---路. 
this closenes~ giving us all. and I grant not 
the least myself, a certain tendency to 
undervalue the remaining details of our 
inspection. Of course, not everyone 
would, under any reasonable circum-
stances, desire particularly to review three 
rather lengthy documents before we may 
engage ourselves more pleasurably by 
interrupting our responsibilities here for 
dinner which, if I'm not mistaken, will be 
quite pleasant. Nonetheless. if I may ask, 
perhaps ... " 


As the gentleman spoke, I alone 
among the jurors gathered around the 
table even pretended to an air of atten-
tion. His face, an overstuffed armchair 
with cushions fluffed carelessly, puffed 
up as an unexpected thought settled 
itself. 


"In an hour, very well, before dinner. 
we shall resolve the matter. If some one 
of you will do me the honor of indicating 
his desire to examine the documents, he 
may report his conclusions to the rest of 
us upon the hour. and if we may trust his 
judgment , our business chall be con-
cluded." 


The gentleman folded his hands with a 
perfect geniality, preparing to await our 
response. My peers displayed complete 
indifference. 


"Very well. I shall read them over." 


And so I took them. My fellow jurors. 
bothering only intermittently to venture 
out from behind their disinterest, sat 
uneasily around the table. Its very sub-
stance seemed to strain under the arduous 
task of remaining inert during the folly of 
our deliberations. 


I was handed the documents. The first , 
l noted immediately, contained a narra-
tive of a courtroom scene itself. I must 
say my preliminary disinclination toward 
undertaking their study was little jeopard-
ized as I began. 

PRELIMINARY REPORT SUBMITTED 
BY ACCUSED HISTORIAN N- -- SUB-
MITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT 
OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE 
CASE OF P--- . 

The Accused sat at the docket rubbing 
his mustache horizontally along the 
upper lip with the bent knuckle of his 
thumb. He seemed to level the full inten-
sity of his attention on the gesture. I felt 
myself rubbing my bare upper lip in rhy-
thm. Evidently, The Accused had only 
this gesture with which to keep himself in 
check. He was waiting, I suppose a bit less 
eagerly than I, for the start of the trial. 
They had quite a while ago sent around a 
boy to forewarn me that the proceedings 
were to begin immediately. Consequent-
ly, I had taken my seat earlier than neces-
sary, a move most unfortunate. The seat 
was hard and badly shaped. As well, my 
tie was auite tidtt around the neck. I 
wondered whether it would be proper for 
someone in my position to undo the 
collar button. These affairs were trying 
for everyone. I felt the pen in my breast 
pocket and relaxed a bit. There was no 
reason for anyone to fe.el uneasy. The 
voice finally came: 

THE COURT IS APPROACHING. 
PLEASE RISE. 

Wondering how long the spectacle 
would take, and fearing for the worst, I 
swayed to my f~et as the President and 
Judges passed close in front and assumed 
their positions. 路路 

THE PRESIDENT: Be seated. I de-
clare this session of the Supreme Colle-
gium of the Final Court open. Mr. Ac-
cused Confessor, have you received a 
copy of the indictment? 

THE ACCUSED: Yes. 

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Do you desire 
to have Counsel for Defense? 

THE ACCUSED: No, I do not need 
Counsel, I do not intend to defend my-
self. I am here to bear full responsibility 
for my crimes. 

THE PRESIDENT: I must explain that 
in the case of an accused who has de-
clined Counsel for the Defense that, in 
addition to his last plea, he has the priv-
ilege to make speeches in defense. 

His arrogant humility was shameful. A 
bore as well. Beyond that, his deceit 
would no doubt receive strict notice from 
the Court. I certainly noticed it. In the 
final analysis that would be enough. His 
attitude on the stand was almost a dis-
appointment. One might actually have 路 
listened to his responses--as a debater he 
was usually competent if humorless-and 
almost wish him innocent. For a moment, 
just before the Court entered, I myself 
entertained certain thoughts in this direc-
tion. But one could see through his pose 
of contrition so easily. I hoped that 
would affect the length of the trial. Be-
.sides. I couldn't be sure how quickly 
they would need the record for the pub-
lic. 

THE PRESIDENT: We shall now pro-
ceed to interrogation of the Accused 
Confessor. 

THE ACCUSED: I have a request to 
make to the Court. I would like the op-
portunity of freely presenting my case to 
the Court, and request permission at the 
beginning of my statement to dwell more 
or less, as far as time will permit, on an 
analysis of the ideological and political 
stand of the criminal "Bloc of Leftists 
and Terrorists", because comparatively 
little will otherwise be said about it in the 
course of the trial and because it has a 
certain public interest and the public 
opinion will determine its historical posi-
tion. I feel my request is not unreason-
able since Citizen the Procurator put the 
question at the preliminary session, if I 
am not mistaken. 

THE PROCURATOR: If the Accused 
intends in any way to restrict the right of 
the State Procurator to put him questions 
in the course of his explanations, I think 
that Citizen the President should explain 
to the Accused Confessor that the right 
of the Procurator to put questions is 
based on law. I therefore ask that this 
request should be denied, as provided in 
the Code of Criminal Procedure. 

THE ACCUSED: That is not what I 
meant by the request. 

I suffered with the tedium of these 
formalities. Legal trickeries would not 
save him, even if they were played out. I 
had once considered proposing to the 
Court that I be called only when neces-
sary. Naturally {I say it only for form's 
sake), I would not suffer in myself any 
tendency to shirk civil responsibility. My 
meaning here is no doubt clear. Any mind 
would dull if it were consigned to unnec-
essary tedium. But I had feared the au-
thorities might misunderstand. There was 
the slight chance they might see anti-
social rationalization behind what, I 
might argue objectively. was a perfectly 
proper evaluation of the circumstances. 
So I had discreetly allowed the matter to 
drop. I wondered now whether to recon-
sider such a proposal. Luckily, guilt was 
guilt. I decided to leave the collar closed. 
Soon enough I could open it outside. But 
I was getting rather annoyed. 

THE PROCURATOR: Allow me to 
begin the interrogation of the Accused 
Confessor. Formulate briefly what exact-
ly it is you plead guilty to. 

THE ACCUSED: Firstly, to belonging 
to the revolutionary '~Bloc of Leftists and 
Terrorists". 

THE PROCURATOR: Since what 
year? 

THE ACCUSED: From the moment 
the bloc was formed. I plead guilty to 
being one of the outstanding leaders of 
this "Bloc of Leftists and Terrorists". 

Consequently. I plead guilty to what 
directly follows from this, the sum total 
of crimes committed by this revolution-
ary organization irrespective of whether 
or not I took direct part in any particular 
act. Because I was responsible as one of 
the leaders and not as a cog of this revolu-
tionary organization. 

THE PROCURATOR: What direct 
aims were pursued by this revolutionary 
organization? 

THE ACCUSED: This revolutionary 
organization, to formulate it briefly ... 

THE PROCURATOR: Yes. briefly. for 
the present. 

THE ACCUSED: The principle aim it 
pursued, although, so to speak, it did not 
fully realize it, and did not dot all the 
"i's" -was essentially the aim of elimina-
ting unfettered private competition 
through speedy public and direct appro-
priation of the means ... 

THE PROCURATOR: Briefly and 
directly you were asked to state the aims 
of your revolutionary bloc. Now then, as 
a group did you aim to overthrow the 
national power? 

THE ACCUSED: The overthrow of 
the national power was a means to our 
end. 

THE PROCURATOR: In what man-
ner. .. 

THE ACCUSED: As is known.
