me. For many years I could not un-
derstand why, on my birthday one year, 
he remained in bed and refused to join 
the celebration. You see, one cannot 
know to suspect such things. Such a fact 
could not be predicted by State officials 
from testimony. 


Of course, one can depend on the 
callous nature of children. They jeer at 
you incessantly. Let your hat be crooked 
or let you have a bandage upon your 
cheek from a hurried shave in the morn-
ing that disfigured an uneven sector of 
the face, that is by the side of the mouth 
there are certain areas which-
The pimple, on my cheek, needed 
attention .. .l recall it. But the Procurator 
has misinterpreted. The preliminary 
report was rushed. I neglected to dis-
tinguish, that, the redness, a natural 
matter of complexion, you understand. 
Exactly so. 


The indiscretion, you realize--was 
unintentional. I take the task seriously. 
Habit. A curious phenomenon both in tht 
general and specific. I keep the trial 
records, in actual transcript form.l place 
them beside me as I begin my historical 
record, naturally. Perhaps I mentioned 
above-during the trial for my own per-
sonal use, I note the circumstances 
around me. Of the following sort--
/ entered the courtroom, witnessing 
the fami/iJlr positioning of the officials, 
my peers, who appeared in Court year by 
year-and so on...:Only one man remains 
apart accomodating himself with diffi-
culty to the su"oundings-and so on·-
You see, I take a sort of diary. I write 
it for myself, though I speak as if to 
another. Harmless impressions I note. If 
one recalls the impressions, you see, the 
logic and detail of the moment are better 
recalled for use later. So I, as a matter of 
habit, but one that has served well--place 
my personal notes (subjective, I grant 
that, but one recalls the other to which it 
is inextricably linked, mediated, you see, 
mediated by my writing). I place the one 
by the other. Never before has there been 
this confusion. Now I have submitted 
both. How could I? This is impossible. I 
am betrayed. I cannot explain. I have 
committed suicide. How many times have 
I thought of it. Never directly. Never with 
an instrument. But this is beyond 
mistake. I have never done this before. 
Do you understand. I meant no paro-
dy. It was a mistake. My intention must 
be considered. I have never done this 
before. My record is clear. I have served 
conscientiously ...

A I have always studied in cramped 
quarters. This is nothing. Heretofore 
space to me has been temporal: In my 
theoretical studies. I have constdered 
world historical sequence. But the work 
has been taken. There is barely time to 
read. They turn off the lights directly 
after the meal. Do not misunderstand. 
The quality of the foc;>d is the leas~ con-
sideration. I work to 1gnore the ammal 
functions alone. But I have changed. I 
have lost the scrubbed pink of the civil 
servant. Tht: nails grow and shape them-
selves. The hair begins to retain the oils. 
There are blank spaces on the scalp, 
furrows, where the scalp peeks through 
covered with a scummy rind. It is not 
balding. Forgive me, this is inconse-
quential. I fight the idle mind.

I write now, given the chance for a 
moment. I display talents long hidden by 
the specific form of labor. The desk 
drawer (have I mentioned they have left 
me a desk and a broken typewriter, I 
soon shall know each part if I remain)-it 
closes unevenly, only with extreme 
pressure. I examined it minutely. A thin 
wood-like plank of board has splintered 
and reaches, now, unevenly above the 
groove through which it was origninally 
intended to slide. I am referring to the 
bottom of the desk drawer. Do you know 
these accordian shaped blades of steel 
which when wedged between two separ-
ated splinter sections of wood, join them 
together. This is what I require. You see I 
have become less abstract .This is a lower 
level of abstraction. I am concerned now 
within a specific historical formation. 


Why have I again waited for the last 
hours of lildlt to take up the pen in hand 
(I speak figuratively, I employ the rna- · 
chine). Trembling, I have removed and 
folded the plain grey cover that has 
encased it. The yellow light forces the 
plain grey cover that has encased it. The 
yellow light forces the dust to appear 
with special clarity. I tap the left side key 
for raising the keyboard. It refuses to 
hold the upper case. I placed a scrap of a 
napkin, folded, in the ribbon guide to 
force the carriage to raise up when nee-
essary. I beat at it with my pen in hand. I 
have rolled the ribbon counter-clockwise 
with my finger so I will not fmd myself at 
a critical moment uselessly striking keys. 
That is, through certain details, I have 
prepared the instrument and am typing. 
And so I am sitting again at a typewriter. 


They have promised that tonight I 
shall be allowed to bathe. Why am I 
si>eaking of these things. There will be a 
strict limit of water. (You see. prisons are 
most gratuitous in the terms they im-
pose). ) c~u)d per _!laps wash once lightly. 
But it is in certain areas that the cloth 
rubs most annoyingly. 1 don't know 
whether the skin is too dry or too oily. 
Soap dries it, I know that. This has not 
been my privilege. The water will not be 
at all plentiful. If it is hot or warm it 
might be best to hurl it directly over the 
head. I could dry the scalp and scratch it 
at my leisure. A white crustiness has 
formed (not alarmingly, this is not really 
unusual) under the mails upon scratching, 
which is more frequent. But if the water 
is very cold, it would be best used around 
the arms and legs. The feet are beyond 
the present interest. Where can they take 
me? (Always, you may note, I inject the 
theory). They have begun to crack be 
tween the toes. Of course this cannot 
interest you. I am idle. This is clear to 
you, no doubt. I must concentrate, and 
leave the details within this space to your 
conjecture. You are interested in broader 
relationships. There lies the explanation. 


B They have taken the typewnter, the 
writing paper, I have always ~own. 


Luckily I was able to hide agamst my skin 
a few sheets I had filled. The ink may 
have smeared against the sweat. I can 
check later. There is no imprimatur, now. 
I write what I know. You may ask how 
they have taken the typewriter with the 
report expected by the day. And the 
writing paper. I cannot say. I will not see 
it again. I have begged for a newspaper. A 
party paper, even a journal. For the

thickness, who can read it and discover. Is 
it not my due? A fair recompense for the 
expropriated portion of my labor. But we 
are too advanced for simple commodity 
exchange. 


I have always read. As a child, even. 
Instead of such a life that, in a certain 
sense, one might admit, that is instead of 
a life of this nature. I have not known the 
way of others. Do I drink or sit at gossip. 
They play bridge until the morning. Have 
I a friend of the kind- Ptitochka, shall we 
go to the ballet, how her cheeks flame, 
her bare neck reddens itself a bit as I 
gaze, she places her hand, just the elegant 
tips of her fmgers, in my palm. Let us 
walk on the prospect. Let us stroll 
through the park. You are poetry to me. 
Here is the laurel for your hair. No in-
deed, my little sweet, it is you. Not I. I 
am blessed with you, my pigeon, without 
aU is barren ... 


But I am distracted from my work.· 
Allow me. It is very hard to read, now. 
There is but one dusty shaft from the 
window. Of course, this is best. The street 
noises cannot distract me. I concentrate 
on the proof of my innocence. It shall 
immediately be laid before you. You 
must understand, the children plotted 
against me. They pointed, jeering at me, a 
trusted official. I did not mention this 
offlcially. As I left the court a group of 
juvenile felons ch~se !11~ out. Where were 
their books, as a child, I was never separa 
ted, lessons had to be copied. They 
chased me to my apartment. 


c 
Was it the last I broke off. I had not 
noticed the light. It is all the same when 
the eyes are accustomed. No more 
chances. That was thirteen days ago. A 
week later I could write again. It means 
nothing to you, the days, I might argue. 
Here time is different. A tile on the wall 
for each minute, a fly per second. The 
walls crawl with them. You understand 
they have not infected me yet. This is 
why I scratch the scalp, to check. The 
nails come ~P clean-that is, cl<_>gged with 
my organic matter alone. Of course there 
is dust. But the living garbage is removed. 
I am slipping from myself again. I must 
explain my disagreement regarding the 
nature of history that placed me here. It 
is not the dialectic that escapes me. But 
who can supply the term. You memorize 
as taught. One extrapolates only within. 
First it is the teacher, a party organ, the 
newspaper, the party itself. History can 
be understood- that is, the progression 
recalled. In dreams, for the exam it is all 
clear. But there is no mechanism. It is the 
rule of history. That is, the distinction 
lies in relation of subject to object. There 
is no knowing subject. This is clear for 
you. It is the historian. The historian 
alone. 


D It is really very clever, on their part, I 
admit. They have not returned the type-
writer. It has been two weeks now. They 
say the case must be completed. My 
testimony. that is the official document. 
is complete: For a time there was only 
the pen. But that was better. I am closer 
to the instruments of my labor. They 
serve at my will. Do you understand? Of 
oourse this is as under early historic 
formations. I was glad to have a pen, so 
that I may continue my pleas. Why have I 
oomplicated the matter so? But they will 
take the pen soon. The chances do not 
escape me. I must have it down. Finally, 
they have told me to write a final plea. A 
final statement. They ask me to summar-
ize my life. Naturally ,little is necessary, 
my case is clear. But, you see, I grab at 
the chance to have a pen. I write lighter, 
superimposed three times, and so have 
more left for the nights. This strains my 
eyes, but it cannot be helped. I think the 
fever has begun. I feel hotter. The room is 
oolder, the soup, the window is clouded. 
My face seems flushed. It remains sweaty 
all the time now. It is red, needs atten-
tion. But they give me no linen. Only 
they have shown by their faces, they will 
take the pen. I must conclude. 
You know what has become of me. 
You realize I do not. I cannot say. You 
see the point. It is a matter of history, 
now.

·1 he children keep shouting. I carry 
books, walking down the stairs. I loosen 
my tie. They do not like me. They are 
laughing at the size of my head. Moilll'rul 
says it's just because we are new in the 
neighborhood. They won't eat lunch 'Vith 
me. I'll study. I have to, what if the exam 
is a day early. I can't go. It's a bad teach-
er. He makes everyone nervous. I can't 
go. I can't go. It will be summer soon. I 
can study at home. 


Very well. I am sufficiently in sight of 
the end. My allowance of time will be 
strictly adhered to. 


.. Fellow jurors, very well. I have con-
cluded my study." 


The gentleman who addressed us 
nearly an hour before spoke again. Eager 
for their release, my peers on this occa-
sion displayed perfect attention. 


..If there are no objections, I shall 
inform the Court of our decision. Sir, 
perhaps you should like to offer a few 
words ... " 


He hesitated a moment, offering with 
this gesture the formal acknowledgement 
of the duty I had taken upon myself. 


.. Thank you. No. There is nothing." 


.. Very well. I shall inform the Court of 
the results of our deliberation. As for 
dinner, who shall order ftrst? I believe 
that honor is yours ... " e

THE FIRST BREAKTHROUGH 
IN LOUDSPEAKERS IN 50 YEARS 

A LOUDSPEAKER BETTER 
THAN MOST AMPLIFIERS! 
When we talk about distortion ratio on the order 
of 1/10 of 1% or less, most people assume we are 
talking about the best of the newly designed direct 
coupled amplifiers. Not so now ... THERE ACTUAL-
LY IS A LOUDSPEAKER WITH AS LOW A DIS· 
TORTION RATIO AS THE BEST AMPLIF I ER! 
The new ESS Heil Air Motion Transformer, devel-
oped by the noted physicist, Dr. Oskar Heil, and 
manufactured under exclusive license by ESS, is a 
revolutionary transducer design that does not gen-
erate sound waves by pushing air with a piston 
"plunger." Instead, the ESS Heil Air Motion Trans-
former harnesses the tremendous power of a pneu-
matic "lever" which, by small squeezing movements 
over a large surface area directly produces air move-
ments FIVE TIMES GREATER than a conventional 
flat surface with one-fifth the motion. As a result 
of the completely new principles by which it oper-
ates, the ESS Heil Air Motion Transformer has near 
instantaneous acceleration, exhibits distortion 
figures as fine as modern electronics, and achieves a 
level of performance that finally approaches theore-
tical perfection.
