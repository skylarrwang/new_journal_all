My favorite is a film of 1903 
called "Electrocuting the Elephant." 
And that's exactly what happens, by 
God. They lead out this enormous 
elephant and there is a long shot of 
him, head on. And you look at this 
elephant and he's chained up and 
suddenly clouds of smoke come up 
from his feet and this great beast 
collapses and twitches-it's just an 
incredible piece of film.
