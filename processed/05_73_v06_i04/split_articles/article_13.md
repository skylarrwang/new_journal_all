Such dilatory ideological foolishness. 
To what end I could only wonder. I knew 
the prosecution. It would not be fuddled. 
I noted carefully, I might say conscien-
tiously, the evasiveness and callow lack of 
respect the Accused paid to the Court. 
Such squirming. The chair was intoler-
able. Perhaps the messenger could be 
induced to procwe me a pillow-- just a 
sm~ll one, perfectly unsatisfactory, like 
the kind one used while driving. As a 
Cowt official I was entitled to certain 
courtesies. The oversight was appalling, 
and not without consequences. My per-
ception should not be allowed to suffer 
through unfortunate external conditions 
that would quite naturally in any human 
being create certain ... psychological 
... distractions and unpleasant conditions 
in the mind that might affect both obser-
vations and conclusions. I shifted my 
weight. 


THE PROCURATOR: By means of a 
forcible overthrow? 
THE ACCUSED: Yes, by means of the 
forcible overthrow of state power. 
THE PROCURATOR: With the help 
of? 
THE ACCUSED: With the help of all 
the difficulties which could be encounter 
ed by this power. In particular with the 
help of a war which prognostically was in 
prospect. 
THE PROCURATOR: Which was 
prognostically in prospect with whose 
help? 
THE ACCUSED: With the help of 
foreign states. 
THE PROCURATOR: On condition? 
THE ACCUSED: On the condition, to 
put it concretely, of a number of conces-
sions. 
THE PROCURATOR: To the extent 
of ... 
THE ACCUSED: To the extent of the 
cession of territory. 
THE PROCURATOR: That is ... ? 
THE ACCUSED: If all the "i's" are 
dotted-on condition of the dismember-
ment of the State. 
THE PROCURATOR: The severance 
of whole regions and republics from the 
State? 
THE ACCUSED: Yes. 
THE PROCURATOR: In whose favor? 
THE ACCUSED: In favor of the cor-
responding states, whose geographical and 
political... 
THE PROCURATOR: And also by 
means of weakening the defensive power? 
THE ACCUSED: You see, tl1is ques-
tion was not discussed, at least not in my 
presence. 
THE PROCURATOR: And what was 
the position in regard to wrecking? 
THE ACCUSED: The position in re-
gard to wrecking was that in the end, 
especially under pressure of the Terrorist 
part of the so-called contact center, des-
pite a number of internal differences, 
which I take are of no interest to the 
investigation, after various vicissitudes, 
disputes and so on, the orientation on 
wrecking was adopted.

At this point there occurred an inter-
ruption of the part of the person directly 
to my left. Scratching his stomach with 
untold pleaswe as if in anticipation of th~ 
bulge that would develop there once my 
task had seen its completion, he inter-
rupted me needlessly (as there was an 
unoccupied man seated to his left idly 
fingering a silver case): 
"Pardon me, have a cigarette extra?" 
"They are never extra. But you may 
have one if you wish. Incidentally, would 
you care to scan the portion I've conclu-
ded?" 
"Actually, I suspect you are in the 
better position to judge them. I was 
rather careless this morning and failed to 
digest some of the earlier details. I was 
about to a:;k you. How do you consider 
these writings? I would guess they are 
pretty dry reading at this point, with the 
deliberations we have carried on." 
"He's a bit off, actually. It is more a 
curiosity than legally germane. I am not 
clear as to what he is intending. As I say, 
perhaps you would like to take a look for 
the sake of your own satisfaction." 
"Well perhaps one of us will. Yes. 
Very likely one of us may-" 
The man on my left, to whom I had 
just spoken, turned slowly to his own 
left, carefully swiveling the trunk of his 
body in the chair, indicating that for him 
such action was a physical feat offering 
an unusual challenge. The man on his side 
immediately began to shake his head 
disappointedly, as if some imperious 
force prevented his accepting the fellow's 
offer to take up the documents. 


THE PROCURATOR: Did it tend to 
weaken the defensive power of the coun-
try? 
THE ACCUSED: Natwally. 
THE PROCURATOR: Consequently, 
there was an orientation on the weaken-
ing, the undermining of defensive power. 
THE ACCUSED: Not formally, not as 
a matter of ideology, but essentially it 
was so. 
THE PROCURATOR: But the actions 
and activity in this direction were clear? 
THE PROCURATOR: Can you say 
the same about subversive acts? 

Detail followed trivial detail, as if the 
events were the key to the verdict. A 
pimple on my forehead needed attention, 
it made me tense. Who would notice if I 
placed a clean index finger unobtrusively 
of course, even carelessly--on either side 
and pressed down with no obvious con-
cern. Such deliberation was certainly not 
frivolous. I had to concentrate unbother-
ed. Yet I could imagine the regrettable 
distraction if the President chanced to 
peer up ... 

The President: You, Citizen Historian, 
rather than conscientiously procuring 
notes as your duty prescribes, you have 
involved yourself quite independently in 
personal endeavor generally unbefitting 
the solemnity of this court. What briefly, 
is your explanation of this? 
Me: Mr. 
aa~en Your Excellence the Presidt>nt,l

Sufferina for my restraint, I bepn to 
feel nauseated. With an effort I focused 
my attention on the proceedinaa. 
THE PROCURATOR: I repeat, Ac· 
c:used Confenor, can you say the same 
about subversive acts? 
THE ACCUSED: With reprd to sub· 
ventve ac:tl··by virtue of the division of 
labor and my definite functions, of which 
you know-1 mainly occupied myself with 
the problematlc:a of aeneralleaderahlp 
and with the ideoloaJcal aide. This, of 
course, did not exclude either my belna 
aware of the prac:tlc:al alde of the matter, 
or the adoption of a number of practical 
steps on my part. 
and activities In this direction were clear? 
THE ACCUSED: In Heael'a "Logic" 
the word "this" Ia c:onaldered to be the 
most difficult word ... 
THE PROCURATOR: I ask the Court 
to explain to the Accused Confeasor that 
he Ia here not In the capacity of a phllo· 
aopher, but a criminal, and he would do 
· better to refrain from talklna about 
Heael'a phllo10phy, It would be better, 
flnt of all for Heael'a phUosophy ... 
THE ACCUSED: A phlloaopher may 
be a c:rlminal.

those who imaalne themselves to be phil· 
osophers turn out to be spies. Phlloaophy

THE ACCUSED: I am speaklna aa I

Ideological referents that determined
