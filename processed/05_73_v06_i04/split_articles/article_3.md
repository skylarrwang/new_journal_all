I arrived at 11 a.m. on the dot, just as we 
had arranged on the phone earlier in the 
week. Mustered up all the coffee-stoked 
courage I had, and pushed the bell. Long 
wait. No sound. I looked around. The top 
floor of a rather high-class Paris apart-
ment-house. Sunlight. Under the door-
bell, their nameplate: IONESCO. 

Then, finally, footsteps down the hall. 
The sound of the lock being opened from 
within. Then another lock. Two more. 
Finally the door swung open, and a very 
small woman stood in front of me in her 
bedclothes, squinting from the light. She 
had just awakened. 
"Madame Ionesco?" 
"Oui, Monsieur." 
"I'm here to speak with your husband. 
We have an appointment for 11 o'clock." 
She looked puzzled. I tried to clear 
things up. 
"Oh," she said, the light finally dawn-
ing, "you're the comedien! Weren't you 
supposed to come next Tuesday?" 
Damn, thought I. This was my last day 
in Europe; I couldn't have made it for 
Tuesday. She hovered for a minute be-
tween sending me away and inviting me 
in. Then: 
"Come in and sit down. I'll see if my 
husband can speak with you." 

A nondescript green armchair. The 
living room is filled with modern art: 
abstract, yet it is not itself a modern 
room. Ionesco appears at one door, disap-
pears through another. The maid walks 
through, looks around disapprovingly, 
and also disappears. 

Then Ionesco comes in to greet me. 
His pajama top is white, his pajama bot-
toms are purple. His robe is yet another 
purple. We are friends from the start. 
"So glad you were able to get hold of 
me," he said. "But weren't you supposed 
to come next Tuesday?" 

We retired to the study and sat down 
to chat. The room was lined with books. 
Not an "absurdist" library, I thought: too 
scholarly. The desk-top was full of rhino-
ceroses, of all sizes and textures. 
"You must love rhinoceroses," I ven-
tured. 
"Not very much, no. It's just that 
since I wrote the play everyone thought 
that I loved them, and all my friends 
started sending them to me. The same 
thing happened with The Chairs. Now 
when I'm in a room full of people and 
somebody uses the word 'chair' or 'rhino-
ceros,' everyone looks at me as if I had 
invented the chair and the rhinoceros. 
Won't you have a whiskey?" 

We re-retired into the living room, 
where the maid had set up a tray. I had to 
help him pour out his fruit juice and 
mineral water (good for the liver), be-
cause his right hand was in a cast. He 
explained that it had happened during his 
summer vacation in the Midi, when he 
had tried to ski down a staircase. 

There was a wild, contorted statue in 
the manner of Tsar that seemed to be a 
man in a funny hat on a sway-backed 
horse. The man's face was featureless, his 
body was twisted and lumpy. 
"C'est 
moi," he said. "The sculptor wanted to 
create the ultimate parody of the eques-
trian statue." I told him that the resem-
blances were striking--the eyes, the 
mouth, the arms, the bearing. We laugh-
ed. 

Ionesco laughs with his eyes and with 
his entire mouth, from diaphragm to lips. 
And the eyebrows--at once strikingly 
prominent yet seemingly lost in that great 
craggy plain of baldness--punctuating the 
laugh. Only the incredibly wide, flat nose 
anchors the other features down by stay-
ing still. All in all, a gorgeous laugh. 

It is late summer, 1967. In the spring I 
had played a leading role, Brother Tara-
bas, in the English-language world pre-
miere of his Hunger and Thirst at the 
Yale Dramat. The Polish critic Jan Kott, 
at that time a teacher at the Drama 
School, had admired the production and 
written Ionesco about it. When Kott 
heard that I would be in Paris on a Bates 
Fellowship he gave me the phone number 
and urged me to use it. I went to Paris 
and, needless to say, I didn't phone. You 
don't just call Ionesco and tell him you 
want to see him, do you? I stayed a 
month in Paris, I went to Avignon, to 
Geneva, to London, and then back to 
Paris for the last week before the return 
flight. And I still had the phone number. 
Well, I reasoned, Ionesco couldn't be 
all bad; when the Dramat had been ma-
king no discernible progress with his agents 
in the effort to get the rights to Hunger 
and Thirst, he had intervened personally 
on our behalf, for no fathomable reason. 
Since he'd been interested in our doing 
the play, he might possibly be interested 
in the production photos I'd brought 
with me. That's it. So I called, and offer-
ed to bring pictures. 

He stared hard at the photos. He quiz-
zed me about all sorts of details ... was 
there enough lighting for the brilliant 
fresh-air plateau in front of the museum 
in the second episode? ... where did all-
male college get its actresses?...what were 
the monks doing in these photos of the 
"Good Inn" of the third episode? 

I explained to him, somewhat tim-
orously at first, how much we had cut 
the scene and changed the order of lines 
to give it more direction. Far from being 
offended, he seemed pleased and interest-
ed, most of all in the gestures he saw the 
monks doing. I explained to him that we 
had differed radically in this respect from 
the earlier production at the Comidie-
Fran~aise. The monks were not mute 
mimes; they were given an active part in 
the interrogation-brainwashing-revival: 
prayers, imprecations, chants, black mass 
blasphemies. Nor were they rooted to the 
symmetrical Brechtian bleachers, as they 
had been in Paris; they swayed, they 
circled, they practically danced. Ionesco 
thought it was wonderful. He thinks it 
would have been better if the Comidie-
Fran~aise had done it that way. He 
wishes he had written it that way. He 
goes to tell his wife.
