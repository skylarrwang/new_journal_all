The playwright wanted to know about 
the director, Leland Starnes, about the 
actors, and about the general setup of the 
Dramat. In passing, I mentioned the lack 
of rehearsal time and the physical punish· 
ment the cast and crew went through to 
get this particular play on the stage. I 
started onto another subject, but he stop· 
ped me. 
"I am very touched," he said. 

Later, he was admiring a marvelous 
photo of the ghost of mad Aunt Ade· 
laide, who was played by a woman who 
had worked with the Dramat and other 
local theatres for thirty years. He asked 
about her. I told him that she had died 
within a month after the final curtain. He 
stared hard at the picture for thirty sec-
onds or so, then sat back, took off his 
glasses, and breathed. 

Still later in the day, while Ionesco 
was in another room, his wife. in a totally 
different context, mentioned a closemess 
that both of them feel to the actors who 
create his characters. It all fits in. That 
was why I was there. 

He worried about the reviews--much 
more than l would have thoU2ht. I ~ve 
him the Register's and the Providence 
Journal's. l helped him a little with the 
English. He actually reads it pretty well, 
though he doesn't speak it at all; the 
English lessons that led to The Bald So· 
prano apparently bore little fruit other 
than the play itself. He had been to A· 
merica several years before, visiting the 
cartoonist Saul Steinberg in New York. 
There were always lots of people around, 
but few of them spoke French or 
Rumanian (his second language; though 
born in Rumania, he had lived in France 
until age 13), so after a couple of days he 
stopped trying to communicate and just 
drank a lot and smiled at everyone and 
enjoyed himself immensely. 

We discussed Hunger and Thirst at 
length. Having worked so hard and lived 
so long with the play I felt reasonably 
confident, especially on the topic of the 
third episode, the black mass in which I 
had been the chief celebrant. He decided, 
on the evidence I gave him, that we had 
avoided the traps that German companies 
had f:.Llen into in their productions; we 
had made of the episode what he had 
intended: "an anti-Brechtian play in the 
style of Brecht." 

He has written a new episode for the 
play. He'Ll keep on writing new ones, he 
says. If you want to produce the play, just 
pick your three favorites. 

I described a recent Silliman College 
production of The Bald Scprano in which 
the director had done various violences to 
the play: in the ftrst scene the Smiths had 
read the lines directly from the Grove 
Press edition while watching The FBI on 
TV; the Fire Chief had masturbated dur-
ing the maid's recitation of her poem 
'1'he Fire"; and so on. lonesco listened. 
He questioned, he puzzled, and he laugh· 
ed. Surprisingly, he seemed disturbed 
about the television; twenty years ago, 
when the play was written, one would 
hardly have expected to fmd a TV in a 
typically English home. l pointed out 
that one doesn't worry about anachro· 
nisms when one puts on lonesco. lonesco 
wa.c; content. 

We talked. And talked. Without order 
sometimes. We leaned in to work out 
intricacies; we leaned back to laugh. I got 
drunk. 

The question of literary influence 
came up. He feels that he is entirely with· 
in the historical line of French writers--es-
pecially jn that he revolts against all of 
them. While contemporary European 
playwrights do keep interested and in· 
formed about each other's work, he hard· 
ly feels their effect on him could properly 
he called an influence; it's too superficial. 
KafKa, for example. did influel'\ce 
him-but he didn't feel it until a dozen 
years after reading Kafka. 

We spoke about the other playwrights 
of modern France, and the productions 
of their plays then appearing in Paris; we 
had seen many of the same plays. We had 
even been at Avignon at about the same 
time--but I had been attending the Festi· 
val (the most important summer event in 
French theatre) and Ionesco had just 
been walking around the town looking 
for the narrowest streets. He had been 
invited to the Fe-stival to act the part of 
the- father in Philippe Adrien's La Baye, 
but he had declined because of worry 
about his health. We touched on Beckett, 
Genet, Sartre, de Ghelderode, Arrabal, 
Adamov, and Obaldia, among others. He 
feels that the "absurdist" revolution of 
the early ftfties was the work of Beckett, 
Pinter and himself--but actually, he ad· 
mits, he is not really familiar with Pinter's 
plays; only a few of them have been 
translated, and still fewer have been pro· 
duced in Paris. He seems to feel much 
closer to Samuel Beckett, though. They 
don't see each ether t00 often, but seem 
to keep in touch. Ionesco admires him 
immensely. 

He tells a story. Beckett has be-en 
working on a new play for a year. The 
curtain goes up, revealing what looks like 
a man half-submerfed in muck and gar· 
bage. He stares out toward the audience 
for a moment, then (and here lonesco 
demonstrates) heaves a great long sigh. 
Curtain. But, says Ionesco, Beckett is not 
yet satisfied with the play; it's still too 
long. 

Strange. I fmd myself talking about 
Ionesco in the third person while talking 
to him across his coffee table. He doesn't 
seem to mind. Sometimes he takes it up, 
more often he speaks of the theatre of 
Ionesco in the first person. Sometimes 
what he says would appear immodest or 
downright boastful, but something in his 
manner announces that matters of pride 
are fairly irrelevant with lonesco. At mo-
ments he may be touchy and defensive, at 
other moments self-denigrating, but final-
ly he ends up dispersing the whole prob· 
lerr. with that laugh. In lonesco's Victims 
of Duty the poet Nicolas d'Eu announces, 
in effect, "No, I don't write at all, and 
I'm proud of it. It would be useless; we 
already have lonesco and lonesco. That's 
eno~h." The man asks to be laughed at, 
and with. 

A couple of times my French breaks 
down. I try to ask him a complex ques-
tion and he doesn't get what I'm driving 
at. I try again and he answers me in the 
most elementary terms. I change the 
subject ~nd feel foolish. Very sobering. 

We talked a great deal about politics. I 
hadn't expected that a playwright so 
opposed to engage theatre should be so 
conscious of it--but it all fit into place, 
eventually. It seems that he has been 
haunted by the idea of totalitarianism. 
World War II is never far from his 
thoughts, and its monoliths pervade his 
dreams. His writing is often a purgation 
of these nightmares, as it was for KafKa. 
Arrabal is similarly tortured by the 
father-figure of his native Spain, btlt 
Ionesco would have him give even freer 
rein than he does already to his va.rious 
panics. Through subjective theatre, 
lonesco feels, one can reach a high degree 
of universality. 

He is soon to have an article published 
suggesting that Americans not be so sen· 
sitive to foreigrt criticism-especially 
Fren-ch. De Gaulle, he says, represents 
and leads that considerable faction of 
Frenchmen who resent the fact that the 
United States has twice saved France, and 
so ignore the fact and blame the U.S. for 
anything and everything. Such countries, 
as he sees it, not only force America to 
stand alone in defense of the entire free 
world against totalitarianism, but also are 
making Americans doubt that their stand 
is just. Vietnam, he readily admits, is 
bothersome to the extreme--but he 
doesn't know what else the U.S. could 
have done. 

We touch on Yale, contemporary 
America, my life, my plans. My immedi· 
ate plan was a 4:00 flight back to the 
States. Two hours away.l would need 
lunch, n 'est-ce pas? And so came lunch·, 
in several quite agreeable courses. Just the 
three of us, me at the head of the table. 
Ionesco worried about his diet, his liver, 
his medicine. He looked at his plate help· 
lessly; his wife noticed, got up and tod· 
dled around behind me, and cut his meat. 
He put his broken hand on the table and 
grumbled disgustedly, "I'm just like an 
infant." 

This and that were discussed. Mme 
Ionesco entered in a great deal. She's very 
pleasant. She keeps the files: reviews, 
letters, photos and such. Shr keeps things 
going. Her first language was Rumanian. 
In a fit of astonishing largesse and bene· 
volence, I congratulated her on her practi· 
cally perfect French accent. Perhaps a fit 
of whiskey and red wine. 

After the main course Mme lonesco 
stepped on a button she had plugged in 
Wlder the table before the meal, and a 
buzzer rang in the kitchen for the maid. 
After a few minutes she buzzed again. 
After a few more minutes she cleared the 
table herself and brought on the che"ese 
and yogurt. Around peach time the doc-
tor came to give lonesco his daily shot. 
It was over. I gulped down the peach 
and stood. lf I were a Pataphysician-a 
follower of the non-philosophy of the
