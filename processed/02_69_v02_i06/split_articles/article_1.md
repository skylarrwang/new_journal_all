Durell was a tall man, with a heavy musculature and thick black hair touched by gray at the temples. He wore inconspicuous dark suits, white button-down shirts, dark knitted ties. Aside from his height, and the way he carried himeslf-which a trained observer could identify as the walk of a dangerous man-he could lose himself in most crowds.


His Cajun accent no longer betrayed him, thanks to his years in New Haven where he picked up a Yale degree and some cash playing cards at Savin Rock. He had started in the business with G-2 and later transfered to the old OSS training ground at Pemberley during World War II. Afterward, he had known there could never be any other work for him, and he had been accepted by the Central Intelligence Agency of the State Department when it was first formed. It was lonely, dangerous, mean and dirty work for him, and the risks went unheralded by bugles.

Edward Aarons, Assignment: School for Spies

The career of Sam Durrell is not entirely a pulp-writer's fancy. Although the games at Savin Rock have long since folded, Yalies for the last quarter century have been leaving their lonely, dangerous, mean and dirty work as students to move from Yale into that ultimate closed corporation on the Potomac, the Central Intelligence Agency. Yale, in turn, through a relationship which neither organization has wished to publicize, has benefitted from a continuing exchange of personnel with the CIA. Today, an ex-CIA officer with fifteen years' experience is a special assistant to President Brewster, another is the University Chaplain, and many other former intelligence operatives teach in Yale's English and political science departments.

The CIA does not run Yale. It does not need to. The men from the CIA who are at Yale today are not active agents of an invisible government. It is disturbing, however, to note how closely the talents required of an effective Yale administrator correspond to those demanded of a good agent. Who for example, could be better suited to represent Yale to New Haven's black community than a man who could convince Adlai Stevenson that the United States had no interest in invading Cuba?

In any case, judging by the number of Yale men who have entered this branch of government service, it seems clear that there are no prevailing ethical standards embedded in the Yale education which preclude cooperation with a super-secret spy agency.

Like Yale, the CIA is basically a community of scholars surrounded by a legion of administrative agents of serviceable virtue who sustain the institution and carry out its bidding. The academic stamp has been on the American intelligence community ever since its founding after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Office of Strategic Services, the immediate forerunner of the CIA was, in fact, known as the "100 professors."

William Kahrl, Yale '68, recently left the graduate program in American studies to work with the Youth Division of the New Haven Police Department.

One of the first of those professors, Norman Holmes Pearson, professor of English and American studies at Yale, explains that scholars were first brought into intelligence work to plug the gaps in military thinking. The Army, for example, never considered the Library of Congress as an important intelligence resource; and yet, one could find there data of the annual rainfall in Tibet, the angle of the beach at Okinawa, the depth of the harbor at Marseilles-

in short, all of the factual material which is essential to an effective intelligence system. Consequently, Archibald MacLeish, then Librarian of Congress, was an early recruit of the fledgling OSS.

Wilmarth Lewis, Yale '18 and a member of the Yale Corporation until 1964, was brought in to establish a central registry of intelligence data based on the filing system he had developed for cataloguing the papers of Horace Walpole.

For many men of a bookish bent whose talents would not have been best applied on the front lines, the OSS afforded a chance for valuable service during the war. Among the men from Yale who joined at this time were Eugene Weyth; John Phillips, curator of the American Art Collection; Sumner Crosby; Bradford Wells; and Sherman Kent, who remained with the intelligence service until his retirement last year. To its critics, the OSS was composed of "a group of middle-aged specialists in anthropology, economics and a dozen other fields, plus a few young instructors who had had Ph.D. training in applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair of libraries." Pearson, a James Bond "M" of Bogart vintage who commanded counter-espionage for all of Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, recalls that his department was composed mainly of professors and lawyers: "Of the two, I preferred the lawyers because they had been trained to make up their minds on the evidence at hand, whereas professors prefer to meditate."

Although the academics played a leading role in organizing intelligence materials, the membership of the OSS was motley. As one veteran remarked, "In those days of the speeded-up draft and the scrambling for jobs, OSS was frequently the last refuge of the well-connected." The founder of the OSS, William J. Donovan, began by bringing in many of his old law partners and acquaintances to help him. Gradually, this "Old-Boy" network spread to include such diverse individuals as the millionaire Paul Mellon, movie director John Ford (who is scheduled to direct a history of the OSS with John Wayne as Donovan), a Yale tackle named George Seabury, Rene Dussaq ("the human fly") and the bartender from the New York Yale Club. As Pearson recalls, "It was a time for remembering people."

Pearson is a man well suited to such times, for his accumulation of well-known friends is as evident to the casual visitor as the bulk of his reading, and there is scarcely a foot of wall space in Pearson's three-room office (outside of the bathroom) which is not lined with books.

One of the more startling names of past acquaintances which Pearson has to recall is that of Kim Philby, the Russian double-agent. In his recently published memoirs, Philby remembers Pearson derisively as "the poet from Yale ... all 'hail fellow well met,' or 'have you heard the one about the lady on the bus.'" And Graham Greene at the time of Philby's defection commented in the Times that Philby had never been so great a threat to British security as Norman Holmes Pearson.

Pearson, who is a proponent of the theory that Philby went bad as a result of reading at an impressionable age Kipling's story of another Kim, reacts sharply to Philby's attack while concurring subtly with Greene's. He points out that while Philby as a Russian agent was rifting British desks, Pearson, as an American agent, was rifting Philby's. Thus, remarks Pearson with a wicked grin, "Philby was right to say that he was well rid of me, because he knew that I was kind."

The operational patterns established by the OSS later shaped the development of the CIA. Research and analysis by trained scholars is still the basis of the intelligence system, and the web of personal friends, school ties and useful acquaintances remains at the heart of the recruitment process. It should not be forgotten that the OSS was an exciting and colorful service as well. It was an organization which sent Tolstoy's grandson Ilya on a mission to the Dalai Lama in the forbidden city of Lhasa, and it gave a brave former Yale student, Roderick Hall, the chance to battle the German Army single-handed in an attempt to close the Brenner Pass to the Axis. Undoubtedly, the aura of adventure still accounts for much of the attractiveness of the espionage business. For example, CIA agent Herbert Itkin, indicted in New York for bribing a high city official, has been implicated in a plot hatched by two East-Side London crime czars to kidnap the Pope.

C. Tracy Barnes, who worked with the French underground during the war and later served with the CIA for nearly all of its history, agrees that for many years the intelligence service attracted men "who like to tear up the pea patch."
