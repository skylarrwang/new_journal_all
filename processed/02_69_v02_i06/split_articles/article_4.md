A while back, WYBC held a contest in which listeners were to complete the sentence, "If God were a Yale man .... "The winner, a sophomore at Connecticut College for Women, answered, "If God were a Yale man, there would be no second coming."

But Heracles, the prototypical hero, had to descend into Hades and return; James Bond returned from a garden of death in You Only Live Twice; and on a somewhat less mythical scale, The New Journal is back. Very honestly, we had to cancel the issue we had planned for the exam period. Besides the ridiculous amount of catching up that most of us had to do, there was also a financial problem or two. But the world is looking bright again, and we will be around this year and next year and as long aftenhat as there are people who want to put out a publication worth reading.

The New Journal is not a staid institution but is rather a few people who are excited by writing, editing, advertising, graphic design and general running around. We don't have heels or any type of formal competition: not that we are anarchists, but we feel most at home in our own personal chaos.

If you are interested in taking an integral part in publishing The New Journal, which is read by about three times as many people as any other Yale publication, whether ye be undergraduate, graduate student, faculty, faculty wife, student wife, please stop by our office in the basement (Room 50) of Silliman College on Wednesday, February 12, after 7:30.

There is an awful lot to be done, and we are looking for the handful of people who want to do it.


**Title: Barnes' nightmare**
**Author: Paul Goldberger**

Who plans Yale? Herb Short is damned if he knows, so he and Manfred Ibel, both students in the School of Architecture, created the Yale Planning Forum. When Short spoke the other night to members of Architecture 131b, a seminar on the Yale community, the talk was of power, people and pedestrian traffic routes. Beer can tops popped all over, and the scene was a far cry from the tinkle of sherry glasses in Woodbridge Hall.

"We clearly exist to usurp power," Short says. "We're going to advise the University just as does Ed Barnes' office." Barnes-better known to the outside world as Edward Larrabee Barnes, A.I.A.-is a New York architect and official planning consultant to Yale. "We're going to come up with our own concrete proposals," Short adds, "and if they're ignored-well, then some of us might become more than intellectual advisers."

As yet, "some of us" includes just Short and Ibel, so a mass student movement against Yale expansion plans hardly seems imminent. But the group plans to set up headquarters in a Chapel Street storefront and Short and Ibel will begin a full time effort to mobilize the Yale community on their first issue: the proposed Mellon Center for British Art and British Studies, slated to occupy the south side of Chapel Street between High and York Streets.

Yale secretly assembled the land before Paul Mellon's gift of a building and art collection was made public in December, 1966.

The Mellon Center epitomizes all that is wrong with Yale design, says the Planning Forum. While supporting the idea of a British Studies center, the group is concerned about the loss of a commercial block on Chapel Street. Chapel, Broadway and Wall Street are the lifeblood of the Yale campus, says Short- who claims the streets give Yale the human element Harvard Square gives Cambridge-and, by the present Mellon plan, the university is placing its institutional demands above the needs of the city and its own student community. Ditto, says Short, for Yale's projected housing, parking and classroom development throughout the campus.

The Mellon Center's architect is due to be chosen in early spring, and the Planning Forum hopes by then to have established itself sufficiently to speak for the student community. "I don't think anything will happen unless we force it to happen," Short says. "The people making decisions about space here see the University as a bunch of academic departments. We have to generate pressure on our side."

Part of this pressure, once the Mellon Center begins moving toward its 1973 target completion date, will be to force the University to include a mall of shops on the building's ground floor to replace the Chapel block. Shore also talks of designing the Center in conjunction with the planned Drama School building, proposed for the rear of the same block.

When the talk gets that long range, Short spews out plans faster than Ed Barnes ever dreamed possible. "There've been proposals to close off York Street," he says, "and make the old Drama School a film society headquarters and a student center. There's also talk of using Freshman Commons as a student center."

Warming up, Short shows the maps he prepared for his thesis presentation, which was based on the Yale Planning Forum. "Orbit," at first glance a sort of abstract version of a New Haven road map, shows the routes preferred by pedestrians across the campus. "They're in complete conflict with the University's plans," Short points out, "because students tend to walk where there's something to see and people to meet--or to take short cuts through buildings such as Woolsey Hall. But the axes are in any case different from those 'planned.'"

The Planning Forum seemed well on its way. Architecture 131b, a mixed bag of students from the Law and Divinity Schools as well as Art and Architecture and Yale College, couldn't find much to argue with in Herb Short's application of student power to the university planning process. Then someone raised the question of student interest, and Short admitted that was the group's problem. "We have to inspire more concern from undergraduates and non-architecture grad students," he said. He noted that most students are indifferent because of their transient position: "When you'll be out of here in four years, it's hard to see a need for concern. Yet students will, in the end, have to become involved. We looked at what was happening at Yale and we got incensed-the old Gothic campus sat in the center, and monolithic institutional buildings were spread around the outside with no relationship to one another. We're at a time of the biggest expansion since the 1930s, and a new image will have to grow out of that the people in the University want."

Finding what the people in the University want and making sure they can have it is what the Yale Planning Forum is for -whether it be a new art gallery, an expansion of library space on the cross campus, or just the guarantee of a place to get a cup of coffee at one in the morning.


**Title: Singer**
**Page number(s): 2, 15**

Out of the charivari of last week's Singer and ROTC issues, emerges a surprising similitude. For in the minds of some faculty sitting in Connecticut Hall last Thursday lurked the argument that the same academic bankruptcy in military training could be shown to lie behind any program that channeled the University's resources into the more practical needs of the immediate community. Such an attitude toward what Whitney Griswold called the "service station" functions of the state colleges seems to underlie the Singer Report itself.

Along with its idealistic, elitist underpinnings, the Report urges that University "contributions to public education will proceed from on-going research interests." Thus stated, without proceeding from the interests and needs of the community, the University's contribution will be that of the experimenting dandy playing piebald games among the locals. Without proceeding from the interests of Yale students, the University will contribute very little to "the contact with that world" that the Singer Report seems to hint is so necessary for the education of an elite. For while it is difficult, given the traditional role of the private, national university, to argue for its responsiveness to the particular needs of the immediate community, to argue for the provision of some direct confrontation with the social problems of the generation seems easier and certainly within the scope of an institution destining its members for leadership.

By its rhetoric, unfortunately, the Singer Report has come to bear more of the onus for Yale's response to the city than its authors claim. The report's concluding but altogether sketchy suggestions deserve some commendation. Inviting other local colleges to assist or handle Upward Bound and venturing jointly with independent private schools such as Choate to restructure pre-college preparation for black students are worthy impulses. Nevertheless, claims can be made that such ventures deal with such a paucity of students that they never affect the crux of the problem, the public school.

As for Yale's responsibility to develop new techniques and structural changes in the public schools, the Report sees Yale's much-touted Social Sciences Research Institute as a panacea. The recently announced Institute will include three centers for the study of contemporary social problems: the Center for Urban Studies, the Center for Urban Education, and the continued on page 15
