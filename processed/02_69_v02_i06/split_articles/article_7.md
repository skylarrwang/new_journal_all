EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the course of the last year, the advanced 
nations of the world have been faced with an 
extraordinary and unprecedented upsurge 
of student unrest. New student tactics have 
taken hold in seventy nations of the world: 
everywhere the pattern has bee~ for .stud~~ts 
to occupy or seek to occupy thear un_aversattes 
until the demanded reforms are achaeved. In 
Czechoslavakia and France, students almost 
triggered major political revolutions .. I pro-
pose, here, to present a very speculauve.argu-
ment concerning the style and psycho-has-
torical situation that unite student protests 
in the more advanced nations of the world. 

One of the factors often cited as an expla-
nation of youthful unrest is the very large 
number of young men and women in the 
world under the age of thirty-which has 
become the critical dividing line between 
generations. But this fact alone does. 
not constitute an adequate explanataon of 
the revolutionary mood of many uni-
versity students. In all historical eras, the 
vast portion of the population has been 
under the age of 30. Indeed, in the most 
primitive societies, most people are dead 
long before they reach that age. If chrono-
logical youth alone were enough to 
insure rebellion, advanced societies, where 
a greater proportion of the population 
reaches old age than ever before in world 
history, should be the least revolutionary, 
and the most piimitive societies should 
be characterized by the greatest youthful 
ferment. This is not the case. 

What does matter, however, are two 
interrelated characteristics of the under-
thirties: first, the relationship of the young 
to the established institutions of the so-
ciety, that is, whether they are engaged in 
them or not; second, the opportunities 
the society provides for continuing intel-
lectual, ethical and emotional develop-
ment after the age of puberty. In both of 
these regards, the present situation in the 
more advanced nations is without any 
precedent. 

Philippe Aries, in his remarkable book, 
Centuries of Childhood, points out that 
until the end of the Middle Ages, no 
separate stage of childhood was recog-
nized in Western societies. Infancy ended 
at approximately the age of six or seven, 
whereupon most children were integrated 
into adult life, treated as small men and 
women, and expected to work as junior 
partners of the adult world. 

One crucial phenomenon in the more de-
veloped nations of the world today is the 
gradual recognition of another stage of 
life, one that like childhood and adoles-
cence before it, was previously allowed to 
only a small minority, but that is rapidly 
being extended to an ever greater group. I 
will call this the stage of youth, and by 
youth I will mean a further stage of disen-
gagement and development that intervenes 
between adolescence and adulthood. 

Kenneth Keniston is an associate professor 
of psychiatry at the Yale M edical School. 
He is the author o.f The Uncommitted and 
The Young Radicals. 

What is new about our present situa-
tion, then, is not that there are more young 
people, but that we have opened to larger 
numbers of them an extended period of 
disengagement and development that con-
tinues into the twenties and often until the 
thirties as well. We have created a new 
stage of life, at least for the more fortu-
nate in the more advanced nations, a stage 
of continuing disengagement from the 
adult structures of the society, a stage that 
provides opportunities for intellectual: 
emotional and moral development whach 
were not afforded to any large group to 
the same extent ever before in history. In 
the student revolts, we are seeing onere-
sult of this advance. 

I have called the extension of youth an 
advance advisedly. There is growing evi-
dence that, on the whole, attendance in a 
university is, all other things held con-
stant, a good thing for the individual in-
volved. Put in an oversimplified phrase, it 
tends to free him-to free him from 
swallowing unexamined the assumptions 
of the past, to free him from the super-
stitions of his childhood, to free him to ex-
press his feelings more openly and to f~ee 
him from irrational bondage to authonty. 

Available evidence indicates clearly that 
this is an effect of attendance at a uni-
versity, not a factor built into the selection 
process by which students are admitted. 

I obviously do not need to suggest that 
all college graduates or all student radi-
cals are free and liberated spirits, un-
encumbered by irrationality, superstition, 
authoritarianism or blind adherence to 
tradition. But as applied to individuals, 
these findings indicate that universities, far 
from only turning out machine-like 
robots who will provide skilled manpower 
for the economy, are turning out ever-
greater numbers of highly critical citizens, 
young men and women who have had the 
opportunity, the leisure, the affluence and 
the educational resources to continue 
their development past the point where 
most men and women in the past were re-
quired to stop it. 

One part of what we are seeing on 
campuses throughout the world is not a 
reflection of how bad higher education is 
but rather of its extraordinary accomplish-

ments on a historical scale. Even the moral 
righteousness of the student rebels, a 
quality both endearing and infuriating to 
their elders, must be judged at least in 
part a consequence of the privilege of an 
extended youth; for a prolonged develop-
ment, we know, permits the individual 
to elaborate a more personal, less purely 
conventional, sense of ethics. 

What the advanced nations have done is 
to create their own critics on a mass basis 
-that is, to create a larger and larger 
group of young men and women who take 
the credal values of their societies as their 
own, who internalize these values and 
identify them with their own best selves 
and who are willing to struggle to imple-
ment them. And at the same time, these 
same young men and women have been 
freed from the requirements of work, 
gainful employment and even marriage, 
permitting them to criticize their society 
from the protected position of disengage-
ment. 

But the mere fact of prolongation of 
psychological development need not auto-
matically lead to unrest. To be sure, we 
have granted to millions the opportunity 
to examine their societies, to compare 
them with their values and to come to a 
reasoned judgment of the existing order. 
But why should their judgment today be 
so unenthusiastic? 

What protesting students share, on a 
worldwide basis, is a mood more than an 
ideology or a program-a mood that says 
that the existing system, the power struc-
ture, is hypocritical, unworthy of respect, 
out-moded and in urgent need of reform. 
In addition, the complaint of repression, 
manipulation and authoritarianism is 
ubiquitous although paradoxical, given the 
apparently great freedoms given students 
in many nations. In America those who 
complain most loudly about being suffo-
cated by the subtle tyranny of the Society 
attend the institutions where freedom is 
in fact greatest. Around this general 
mood, specific complaints arrange them-
selves as symptoms of what they often 
call the "exhaustion of the existing so-
ciety." 

To understand this phenomenon, we 
must recognize that during the decades 
since the second World War, a number of 
societies have begun to move past the 
industrial era into a new world that is post-
industrial, technological, post-modem, 
post-historic or, in Brzyzinski's terms, 
"technectronic." In western Europe, the 
United States, Canada and Japan, the first 
contours of this post-industrial society are 
already apparent. And in many other less 
developed societies, middle-class profes-
sionals (whose children become activists) 
also Jive in post-industrial subcultures. 

Whatever we call this new kind of society, 
it has demonstrated that for the first time 
in history man can produce more than 
necessary to meet his material needs. 

This accomplishment is admittedly 
blemished by enormous problems of eco-
nomic distribution in the advanced na-
tions, and it is in terrifying contrast to the 
overwhelming poverty of the Third 
World. Nevertheless it has become clear 
that what might be called "the problem of 
production" can, in principle, be solved. 

If all members of American society, for 
example, do not have enough material 
goods, this is because the system of distri-
bution is flawed. The same is true, or will 
soon be true, in a number of other nations 
that are approaching advanced states of 
industrialization. Characteristically, these 
nations, along with the most techno-
logical, are those where student unrest has 
recently been most prominent. 

The transition from industrial to post-
industrial society brings with it a major 
shift in social emphases and values. Indus-
trializing and industrial societies, what-
ever their political organizations, tend to 
be oriented toward solving the problem of 
production. An industrial ethic--some-
times Protestant, sometimes socialist, 
sometimes communist-tends to empha-
size psychological qualities like self-dis-
cipline, delay of gratfication, achievement-
orientation and a strong emphasis on 
economic success and productivity. The 
social, political and economic institutions 
of industrializing societies tend to be or-
ganized in a way that is consistent with the 
goal of increasing production. And as 
many have noted, industrial societies tend 
to apply universalistic or uniform stan-
dards, to reward achievement rather than 
status acquired by birth, to emphasize 
emotional neutrality ("coolness") and ra-
tionality in work and public life. 

The emergence of post-industrial so-
cieties, however, means that growing 
numbers of youths are brought up in fam-
ily environments where abundance, rela-
tive economic security, political freedom 
and affluence are simply facts of life, not 
goals to be striven for. To such young men 
and women, the psychological impera-
tives, social institutions and cultural 
values of the industrial ethic seem largely 
outdated and irrelevant to their own life 
situations. 

When the young perceive that the prob-
lem of production has been or can be 
solved, when it has been solved in their 
own life-experience, they become unre-
sponsive, bored or "turned off" by values, 
institutions and psychological demands 
that originated in a society where produc-
tion was crucial. Once it has been demon-
strated that a society can produce more 
than enough for all of its members, at least 
some of the young turn to other goals: 
for example, trying to make sure that so-
ciety does produce enough and distributes 
it fairly, or else searching for outlooks 
arid life-styles that will enable them to live 
meaningfully with the goods and the 
leisure they already have. The problem is 
that our society has, in some realms, ex-
ceeded its earlier targets and, lacking new 
targets, has become exhausted by its suc-
cess. As a result, even though material 
conditions are in many respects better 
than ever before in world history, this era 
brings an unprecedented and surprising 
upsurge of student protest and unrest. 

When the values of industrial society 
become devitalized, the elite sectors of 
youth-the most affluent, intelligent, priv-
ileged and so on--come to feel that they 
live in institutions with imperatives that 
lack moral authority or, in today's jargon, 
"credibility." The moral imperative be-
hind production, acquisition, materialism 
and abundance has been lost. 

Furthermore, given the lack of moral 
legitimacy felt in "The System," the least 
request for loyalty, restraint or conformity 
by its representatives-for example, by 
college presidents and deans-is viewed as 
a moral outrage, an authoritarian repres-
sion or a manipulative co-optation. 

Thus, I suggest that the vague feeling of 
oppression voiced by so many.students 
springs from their feeling that the existing 
society has lost its ethical mandate and 
credibility, so any demand from that so-
ciety is an exercise in "illegitimate author-
ity" and must be exposed and resisted. And 
perhaps that peculiar sense of suffocation 
felt by dissenting students arises ultimately 
from living in societies without vital ethi-
cal claims. 

Given such a situation, it does not take 
much to trigger off a major protest. I 
doubt that school, college and university 
administrators are in fact more hypo-
critical and dishonest than they were in 
the past. American intervention in Viet-
nam, while many of us find it unjust, 
outrageous and cruel, is not in itself more 
outrageous than other similar imperial-
istic interventions by America and other 
nations within the last century. And the 
position of blacks in this nation, although 
disastrously and unjustifiably disadvan-
taged, is materially and legally better than 
ever before. Similarly, the conditions of 
students themselves in America have never 
been. so good, especially at those elite col-
leges where student protests are most com-
mon. But this is precisely the point. It is 
because so many of the other problems of 
American society seem to have been re-
solved or to be resolvable in principle that 
students now react with new indignation 
to old problems, turn to new goals, and 
propose radical reforms. 

So far I have emphasized the moral ex-
haustion of the old order and the fact that 
for the children of post-industrial afflu-
ence the once-revolutionary claims of the 
industrial society have lost much of their 
validity as a source of immediate per-
sonal motivation. I now want to argue that 
we are witnessing on the campuses of the 
world a fusion of two revolutions with dis-
tinct historical origins. One revolution is 
the old and familiar revolution of the in-
dustrial society, the liberal-democratic 
egaJitarian revolution which has not yet 
been completed in any nation of the world, 
the revolution that started, if you will, 
in America and France at the turn of the 
18th century and that has since spread to 
virtually every nation in the world. The 
other revolution is the new revolution, the 
post-industrial revolution, which seeks to 
define new goaJs relevant for the 20th 
and 21st centuries.

In its social and political aspects, the 
industrial revolution has been a revolution 
of universalization, in the sociologist's 
awkward terms. It has involved the pro-
gressive extension to larger and larger 
numbers of people of economic, political 
and social rights, privileges and oppor-
tunities originally available only to the 
aristocracy, then only to the middle-class, 
and now in America, for example, only 
to the relatively affluent and white work-
ing class. It is in many respects a quantita-
tive revolution: that is, it concerns itself 
less with the quality of life than with the 
amount of political freedom, the quantity 
and distribution of goods, or the amount 
and level of injustice. 

In our own society, as we approach the 
targets of the first revolution on which our 
society was built, to be poor becomes out-
rageous; and even to witness poverty, dis-
crimination, exploitation and oppression 
in others becomes intolerable. In our 
own time, the impatience to complete the 
first revolution has grown apace, and we 
find less tolerance, less patience, less 
willingness to compromise and forgive 
among the young, especially among those 
who now take the values of the old revolu-
tion for granted-seeing them not as 
goals, but as rights. 

A subtle shift has thus occurred. What 
used to be utopian visions-for example, 
equality, freedom from discrimination, 
abundance-have now shifted to become 
demands-inalienable rights upon which 
one can insist without brooking any com-
promise. It is noteworthy in student con-
frontations that no one today requests 
anything: students present their "de-
mands". 

So on the one hand we see a growing 
impatience to complete the first, the lib-
eral-industrial revolution, to extend the 
economic, social and political claims of 
liberalism to all, a growing intolerance of 
a society where oppression, inequality 
and exploitation persist. But on the other 
hand, admixed with the demands of the 
old revolution is a second revolution con-
cerned with newer issues, a new revolution 
that is less social, economic or political 
than psychological, historical and cultural, 
a revolution less concerned with the 
~uantities of things than with their quali-
ties, a revolution that judges the virtually 
complete liberal revolution and finds it 
~till wanting. "You have to have grown up 
•n Scarsdale to know how bad things 
really are," said one radical student. 

This comment would probably sound ar-
rogant, heartless and insensitive to a poor 
black, much less to a citizen of the Third 
World. But he meant something important 
by it. He meant that even in the Scarsdales 
of America, with their affluence, their up-
per middle-class security and abundance, 
their well-fed, well-heeled children and ex-
cellent schools, something is wrong. Eco-
nomic affluence does not guarantee human 
fulfillment; political freedom does not 
yield inner liberation and cultural free-
dom; social justice and equality may leave 
one with a feeling that something else is 
missing in life. "No to the consumer 
society" shouted the bourgeois students of 
the Sorbonne during May and June of 
1968-a cry that understandably alienated 
French workers, for whom affluence and 
the consumer society are still central 
goals. 

What, then, are the targets of the new 
revolution? I approach this question with 
great diffidence, since I feel that if I, or 
anyone, could answer that question satis-
factorily·, we would indeed be prophets of 
a new age. As is often noted, students 
themselves do not know what these ob-
jectives are: they speak vaguely of "a so-
ciety that has never existed"; of "new 
values," of a more humane world; of "lib-
eration" in some psychological, cultural 
and historical sense. Their rhetoric is 
largely negative, and it is only indirectly 
that we can discern certain trends in the 
rhetoric of the student the world across 
that point to the still unformulated targets 
of the new revolution. 

First is a revulsion against the notion of 
quantity, particularly economic quantity 
and materialism, and a turn toward no-
tions and concepts of quality. One of the 
most delightful slogans of the French stu-
dent revolt was "Long live the passionate 
revolt of creative imagination." There is 
some sense in which the achievement 
of abundance may enable us to turn to 
examine, as only a few artists and mad-
men have examined in the past, the 
quality, intactness, joyfulness and zestful-
ness of our daily and immediate experi-
ence, including the interweaving of imag-
ination in our Jives. 

Another goal of the new revolution 
involves a revolt against uniformity, 
equalization, standardization and homo-
genization. At times this revolt approaches 
anarchic quaintness, but it has a strong 
positive core as well. This core is a demand 
that individuals be appreciated not be-
cause of their similarities or despite their 
differences, but because they are different, 
diverse, unique and non-interchangeable. 
The same pressure is evident in a thousand 
areas: for example, the insistence upon a 
cultivation of personal idiosyncracy, 
mannerism and unique aptitude; even the 
rejection of the melting-pot and con-
sensus-politics view of American life in 
favor of a post-homogeneous America in 
which cultural diversity is underlined 
rather than denied. 

The new revolution also involves a con-
tinual struggle against psychological or 
institutional closure or rigidity in any · 
form. Positively, it extols the virtues of 
openness, motion and continuing human 
development. What Robert J. Lifton has 
termed the protean style is clearly in evi-
dence in this new revolution. Fixity and 
rigidity of all forms is fought against, even 
the rigidity of a determinate adult role. As 
an alternative, there is emerging a concept 
of a lifetime of personal change, of an 
adulthood of continuing self-transforma-
tion, of an adaptability and openness to 
the revolutionary modern world that will 
enable the individual to remain with it, 
psychologically youthful and on top of the 
present. 

A final characteristic of the new revolu-
tion is the revolt against centralized power 
and the complementary demand for par-
ticipation. What is demanded is not merely 
assent by the governed, but the involve-
ment of the governed in the governance of 
their lives and their communities. The 
phrase "participatory democracy" of 
course summarizes this aspiration, but the 
aspiration extends far beyond that one 
phrase and the rudimentary social forms 
that have sprung up around it. The de-
mand for participation extends to the 
demand for relevance in education, that is, 
for a chance for the individual to partici-
pate as a human being in his own educa-
tional experience, in such a way that all of 
his faculties, emotional and moral as 
well as intellectual, are involved in his 
education. The demand for participation 
is also embodied in the new ethic of 
"meaningful human relationships" in 
which individuals confront each other 
without masks, pretenses and games, "re-
late" to each other as unique and irre-
placeable human beings, develop and 
devise new forms of relationships from 
which all participants will grow.
