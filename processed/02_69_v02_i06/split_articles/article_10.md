"That spring I moved to New York, and 
we began to practice every day. Things 
weren't totally together, the drumming 
was still a problem, but it worked out. The 
music was really getting more coherent 
and more interesting. We were doing a lot 
of formal arranging, things that were 
more complex musically, something I had 
hoped for all along. I wanted to combine 
the songs that Tuli and Ed were writing, 
which I felt were really worthwhile, with 
music that would form a real rock-and-
roll ethos. We wanted to make some 
money to be able to continue to reach 
other people, and we saw the music as a 
kind of political action. 

"The music we were playing was pretty 
revolutionary. People talk about the songs 
of the Mothers of Invention; well, I guess 
we were the fathers of the Mothers. Their 
first album, Freak Out, was an idea that 
had been going on in New York for some 
time. We used to play at benefits with a 
group called the Falling Spikes, and to-
gether we'd be called the Transcendental 
Simulematic Orchestra; we'd play the 
background music for underground 
movies and light shows on dancing people, 
which was all starting at that time. The 
FaUing Spikes eventually became the 
musicians for Andy Warhol's group, the 
Velvet Underground. We referred to the 
music as acid rock and body rock and 
flesh rock and grope rock. A lot of those 
terms could really be ascribed to Ed 
Sanders, because he introduced a lot of 
terminology into the jargon that had been 
Times Square creep language. In fact, his 
position in the new linguistics was pretty 
central. 

"That summer we did a peace concert 
at Carnegie Hall. There was an archetypal 
black blues singer there, blind, who played 
the twelve-string guitar beautifully. He 
-started singing a slow spiritual song, and 
Joan Baez sort of popped into the room 
and joined in. Ken Weaver was drunk at 
the time and got into a big argument with 
Theodore Bike!, who kept pounding his 
chest and yelling that he had been a mem-
ber of the Movement for 30 years and we 
were just punks. I guess it was the voice of 
the Establishment. 

"The war was a pretty important issue 
among these people, even back in '64 and 
'65. At the time I felt the US was at least 
making a mistake if not doing something 
immoral. I was pretty involved, and I 
probably would have stayed with them for 
a year or so longer, or at least until I had 
decided to go back to Yale. The people I 
met were great: Harry Smith, Ted Berri-
gan and Alan Ginsberg, who is a friendly, 
open and warm guy who always gives you 
a friendly little grope when you see him. 
But then the Army moved into my life. 

"When I left Yale, it occurred to me that 
I might be drafted, but I intended to cop 
out, like so many people I know in New 
York. I had originally planned to appear 
before the physical board as a drug user 
and hope that they would reject me. The 
guys in the band didn't want me to go and 
offered to come with me and throw a big 
scene and help me put holes in my arms. 
But I was called up in the peak month of 
October, '66, and anyone with two legs 
was accepted. So it came down to a choice 
of going in peacefully or going to jail. And 
I doubted what support the Fugs could 
provide in a court case. 

"I really wasn't willing to be a martyr, 
although I thought it was a bad idea to 
become involved in the army. I was really 
questioning myself, because I couldn't be 
sure that my motives were pure. Although 
I felt that this war was a bad thing, I also 
believed that it was an inevitable function 
of human civilization and that it probably 
wouldn't end in my lifetime. Most of my 
opposition was just a feeling that I didn't 
want to be interrupted, that I didn't want 
to be bothered. 

"When it came down to my actual in-
duction scene, it was pretty long and pain-
ful and rather traumatic. I was regarded 
as being a freak because I had long side-
burns and fairly long hair. So on the way 
down to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, I 
ducked into a barbershop and got a straight 
haircut; I wasn't about to give any Army 
barber some kind of orgasm from cutting 
my hair. At Fort Jackson, it was complete, 
total disorientation. The whole idea of 
Army training is to give you a feeling of 
isolation and unfamiliarity that empties 
you out and makes you receptive to the 
military way. 

"At the time, I wasn't feeling sorry for 
myself. As soon as I accepted the fact that 
I was in the Army, I decided to devote my 
energies to doing a good job, so that I 
wouldn't get harassed more than neces-
sary. I tend to be fairly practical and prag-
matic anyway, and I had such a feeling of 
academic failure in the back of mind that 
it was a relief to do well on the tests they 
gave us in basic. 

"The reaction among Gis to my being a 
Yalie and a former Fug was one of sur-
prise, but I didn't get much of a hard time. 
Our platoon became very close as a unit, 
and none of the others did. It was great to 
be part of cohesive, working group, some-
thing I guess I wanted with the Pugs. I 
found it easy to see what was demanded of 
me and to perform without feeling that I 
was really being changed. It was a kind of 
resuscitation period. It had occurred to me 
that the Army would be a kind of interest-
ing time out, and when I finally got in, I 
decided that I would use the two years to 
become physically and mentally fit. 

"I was assigned to be a radio operator 
in a stateside base, although I had re-
quested to be a medic. I had hoped that 
I would have time to do some writing, but 
at the end of every day we'd all go off and 
get drunk or high. I had a lot of free time, 
and I would go up to New York all the 
time in those first months to see the Fugs. 

"Most of the guys drafted were afraid 
or didn't want to go to Vietnam, and they 
didn't volunteer for infantry or armor.! 
didn't want to be the company peace creep, 
because I didn't see how it would do any-
thing. I was able to work some people 
around to a kind of skepticism, but you 
begin to get the feeling of kinship with the 
poor Gis who are no better nor worse than 
you but are over there anyway. In April I 
found out that I was going to Vietnam; my 
orders came in the last week of June, and 
I left on July 27." 
Jack is surprisingly casual about the 
transition from Fug musician singing "Kill 
for Peace" and participating in the early 
peace protests to a radio operator in South 
Vietnam. He was assigned to a twelve-
hour night shift with the Signal Corps and 
spent most of his free time reading and 
relaxing.
