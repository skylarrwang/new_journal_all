During the Korean War, the CIA also 
offered the singular advantage of being 
one of the few government agencies where 
liberals and leftists could work without 
fear of the shadow of Joe McCarthy. Dur-
ing this period the CIA began its financing 
of the National Student Association for 
participation in leftist world youth fes-
tivals, and Allen Dulles, the CIA chief, 
took his stand against McCarthy in de-
fense of William Bundy. For liberals like 
New York Magazine editor Gloria 
Steinem, founder of the Independent Re-
search Service, the CIA was the only 
place to turn for funds to represent the 
United States at communist festivals 
abroad. For pea-patch terrors of the 
calibre of William Sloane Coffin, the CIA 
offered more: it offered "the chance to 
work on the side of Socialism against 
Communism." 

Reverend Coffin has always been dis-
creetly candid about the fact of his service 
with theCIAfrom 1950to 1953 and 
candidly discreet about the nature of his 
work tor the agency. He had not yet re-
ceived his call to the ministry. when he 
entered the service; he was interested in 
international relations and spoke fluent 
Russian. His assignments never brought 
him into the agency headquarters in 
Washington, and he left the CIA after 
three years with what he calls "a narrow 
impression of a pretty outstanding group 
of guys." Coffin still sees a few of his 
friends in the CIA and is proud of the 
personal ties that have survived politics. 
"They look on me as a traitor, and I 
look on them as murderers," he explains 
jovially. 

Liberals for the sake of Mr. Coffin's 
reputation and conservatives for the sake 
of the agency's undoubtedly would all 
prefer to believe that the agency which 
Coffin joined during the Korean War is a 
very different organization from the CIA 
today. Chances are that it is not. The CIA 
has continued to recruit intelligent liberals 
wherever it can find them, and on Viet-
nam, for example, the agency has main-
tained a relatively dovish stance. Coffin 
certainly does not regard this past associa-
tion as any blot upon his record, although 
it did cause some slight trouble when he 
was appointed to the Advisory Board to 
the Peace Corps at a time when Sargent 
Shriver was striving mightily to keep that 
organization free of CIA infiltration. 

According to C. Tracy Barnes, who bas 
been with the CIA for the last fifteen 
years, the agency bas changed. "Over the 
years there has been a gradual accumula-
tion of procedures ... tep.ding to keep 
out the pea-patch-tearer-uppers ... " 
Barnes should know. A Groton-Yale-
Harvard-Law graduate, he spent the war 
working with the French underground. 
From January to June, 1945, he worked 
with Allen Dulles in Switzerland arrang-
ing the surrender of northern Italy. After 
a few years of other government work 
and private law practice, Barnes went to 
work for Dulles again in the CIA in 1952, 
where he remained until 1967. His name 
bas appeared in connection with the 
agency on various occasions, notably as 
the most prominent liaison officer to the 
State Department during the planning of 
the Bay of Pigs invasion. According to 
Arthur Schlesinger in A Thousand Days, 
it was Barnes and he who, on AprilS, 
briefed Adlai Stevenson on the coming 
invasion. On the basis of that briefing, 
Adlai Stevenson stood up on the morning 
the boats bit the beaches to assure the 
nations of the world that the US had no 
part in the plot against Cuba. Schlesinger 
later admitted that the briefing may have 
been "unduly vague." 

Barnes was with the agency during its 
greatest growth period, under the Repub-
licans. Probably the full story of how the 
agency grew during this period will never 
be known: how, for example, McCarthy 
was kept out; how the FBI was beaten 
back in its attempts to encroach upon the 
CIA's sphere of activity; who was ulti-
mately responsible inside the executive 
branch for overseeing the agency's growth. 
Certainly the fact that the chief of the 
CIA, Allen Dulles, was the brother of 
the Secretary of State made for an in-
formal intermeshing of power which few 
departments of government could match. 
Also, the fears bred by the Cold War 
helped the agency, as Barnes explains, to 
see itself as "a necessary tool of govern-
ment policy." Wl\atever the combination 
of circumstances which Jed to this result, 
the CIA within a decade doubled its staff, 
acquired a budget half again as large as 
that of the Department of State, and hired 
a body of men more flexible, more experi-
enced and in some cases more influential 
than their counterparts in State. 


According to Tracy Barnes, this all 
changed with the Bay of Pigs debacle. 
"There was a change of attitudes. Until 
then, if the agency did exceed its limits, 
it d id so with the consent of the govern-
ment. After the Bay of Pigs, there was 
distrust of the agency within government." 
John F. Kennedy grumbled at the time, 
"I made a mistake in putting Bobby in 
the Justice Department .... Bobby should 
be in CIA. ... McNamara has dealt with 
Defense; Rusk has done a lot with State; 
but no one has dealt with CIA." 

In the spring of 1967, the CIA suffered 
a setback which was, in some ways, even 
more damaging: the disclosure of the CIA 
funding of the National Student Associa-
tion. In subsequent investigations, CIA 
money was found in everybody's pocket 
from MIT and the American Newspaper 
Guild to Norman Podhoretz. Before this, 
Barnes feels, except for occasional leaks 
agency critics "didn't have anything to 
get their hands on" unless they wanted to 
attack the agency as a governmental unit 
on ethical grounds. As W. Eugene Groves, 
President of the NSA at the time, re-
marked in a paper subtitled "Second 
Thoughts after the Storm": 

"In reacting to the CIA/ NSA expose, some 
Americans saw themselves almost directly 
threatened. Some saw a manifestation of 
what American society, and interpersonal 
relations within this society, ought not to be. 
At the same time, others saw nothing wrong 
with using secretive methods to fight out-
siders, 'them.' And conservatives saw their 
own economic and political interest jeopar-
dized by covert support of liberal groups, 
feeling that the money was given to the 
wrong people.'' 

Today, two years later, it is still difficult 
to assess the damage to the CIA. The 
agency's Covert Action Division #5, 
which handled most of the funding, has 
not grown new tentacles where the old 
ones were struck off; and the division 
head, Robert Kiley, a former president 
of NSA, has dropped out of sight. The 
Katzcnbach Commission appointed by 
the President in February, 1967, has put 
an end on paper to all covert funding of 
domestic organizations. But C.A.D. #5 
still exists, and it is a good guess that the 
money is still going out, only the vehicles 
have changed. 

More important, the agency may have 
lost the ability to regenerate its ideals and 
the capabilities of its personnel because 
of the damage the disclosures may have 
done to the agency's recruiting program. 
The NSA is one example. When the 
NSA decided to admit to its connections 
with the CIA, an attempt was made by a 
number of people connected with the asso-
ciation to investigate the relationship and 
make a full discloure of all the details. It 
became clear that the NSA through its 
international programs bad never been 
actively engaged in spying per se, nor had 
it ever been able to provide the agency 
with useful intelligence of any importance. 
The CIA admitted as much. Why then did 
the agency continue to finance the NSA 
for so long? 

The reasons accepted at that time had 
to do with internal disputes over recruit-
ing programs. There appeared to be a 
division within the CIA between the 
liberals of the OSS school and the later 
Dulles recruits generally described as 
"FBI-mentality" types. According to the 
story, the liberals were using the NSA as 
a recruiting resource to replenish their 
own ranks within the agency. 

CIA people today tend to discount 
this story, pointing out that such are-
cruiting plan could never have worked. 
They insist that there is no way of know-
ing that a man who is a liberal NSA 
staffer at twenty-two is going to feel the 
same way about world events after five 
years within the C IA. They explain the 
rationale for the NSA support much more 
simply, as nothing more than an attempt 
to build a base for influence within the 
ranks of the new generation of college 
students. To that extent, they argue, the 
NSA venture was a qualified success. 

But the opportunity for maintaining that 
influence has been lost, largely because 
of bad press. The CIA maintains no public 
relations office. In fact, it closed its public 
affairs office in Washington four years ago 
with the simple announcement that "a 
top-secret intelligence agency has no 
public affairs." For the agency, there is 
nothing to do but wait for the ill feelings 
raised by the disclosures of 1967 to sub-
side in time. In the meanwhile, Tracy 
Barnes admits that he has no idea "where 
the bright young liberal minds are going 
to come from."
