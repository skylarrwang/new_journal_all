Mr. Fug joins long-range patrol 
by Jeff Pollock 
That which you have loved with youthful 
enthusiasm and admired with youthful ardor, 
that which you have secretly and mysteri-
ously preserved in the innermost recesses of 
your soul, that which you have hidden in the 
heart: that which you have learned to know 
bit by bit, like a bird gathering straws for its 
nest, happier over each separate little piece 
that over all the rest of the world; that you 
always approach with a certain shyness, with 
mingled emotions, when you know that the 
purpose is to try to understand it. I know 
that what I have hitherto understood is very 
little, so there will always be enough left 
behind. 

Sillren Kierkegaard, Either/ Or 

I floated lonely down the street one day, 
Who did I see slither my way 
Slum Goddess from the Lower East Side, 
Slum Goddess, gonna make her my bride, 
There's not a chick in the world who's half as 
hip as she 
My swinging little Goddess from Avenue D 
It's really very groovy 
To take her to a movie, 
Where we make it in the balcony. 

Ken Weaver, "Slum Goddess" 

Jack Anderson ·s apartment on Chapel 
Street is big and roomy. A few photos of 
army buddies in Vietnam and a little oil 
painting of some sunflowers that be did 
before going into the service grace the 
spotless white walls. The only other 
mementos from his three years away from 
Yale are a cigarette lighter inscribed, 
"John A. Anderson, Ill, First Infantry, 
Vietnam, June, 1967-July, 1968" and a 
crumpled old Playbill from "An Evening 
with the Fugs" at the Players' Theater. 
Jack offers us a seat on his trunk and 
settles back into a canvas Yale director's 
chair. It is the only piece of furniture in 
the room. 
"The summer after my freshman year 
at Yale, I worked at the New York World's 
Fair and lived in an apartment on the 
Lower East Side. I wandered around the 
neighborhood and heard about a rock 
group caJled the Fugs playing at the 
Bridge Street Theater. I went one night 
and talked to them and then met them 
again at the Peace Eye book store, which 
was run by their leader, Ed Sanders. They 
were all amazingly energetic guys. Ed got 
his B.A. in Greek and Latin literature 
from NYU and was a pretty active poet. 
He had worked at a tobacco stand on 
Times Square for a while until he got 
enough backing to open the Peace Eye. 
"The Pugs had really gotten going dur-
ing the previous winter. Ed had grown up 
with classical rock and roll in the fifties. 
He was high school class of '56 and a 
cheerleader at the time, you know: "Tough 
as nails, hard as bricks, Southwest High 
School fifty-six!" In fact, that's why Ed is 
in a footbaJI uniform on the cover of the 
Fugs' second album. 
"The other core members of the group 
were Ken Weaver and Tuli Kupferberg, 
an old-time New York anarchist and poet. 
Tuli has always had a tremendous follow-
ing, primarily of young girls. He's a very 
beatific person, like a kindly wise uncle, 
but it wasn't always totally platonic. He's 
not a dirty old man-he takes young girls 
to bed sometimes and just interdigitates 
with them. 
"My best friend was Ken Weaver. He 
was born a bastard in Texas and had some 
pretty traumatic times moving from one 
foster home to another. After four years 
in the Air Force as a Russian translator, he 
got a job working on Wall Street. As kind 
of a reaction to the service, he wore turtle-
necks to work and started letting his hair 
and beard grow. He eventually quit Wall 
Street and lived by donating blood for five 
bucks a pint. When I met him he was 
sleeping in the back room of Ed's book 
store.

"I was a guide that summer in the Fed-
eral pavillion at the New York World's 
Fair. The Fugs thought it was interesting, 
and I was a new kind of person for them 
to have as a friend, a Yalie. We made 
friends quickly enough so that there were 
no undercurrents-! laughed at them and 
they laughed at me. I bought a bass guitar 
and kind of joined up." 
"With the Fugs I played bass, Ken 
Weaver was on conga drum, and there 
were two other musicians who played as 
sidemen, Peter Stamfel and Steve Weber 
of the Holy Modal Rounders. The group 
was playing the old kind of music I used to 
like; we sung two William Blake poems 
in bluegrass and did rock and roll par-
odies. 
"Tuli and Ed had decided that they 
wanted to use rock and roll to convey 
poetry of their own. They had visions of 
merging modern poetry with modern 
music, which both of them appreciated as 
a classical idea. With Dylan's new music 
a Jot of rock was becoming poetic, and 
since I expressed an interest they indicated 
that they would like to have me along. 
"Obviously I didn't look like them 
much, because my hair wasn't very long 
and I didn't have a beard. But they were 
· the last people at that time to worry about 
any kind of image. In fact, later on my 
image became valuable as a sort of oasis 
of innocence. They accepted me on the 
basis of the contribution I made, which 
was dependability and some sort of orga-
nized music. You see, I could be counted 
on to play the same note roughly at the 
same time in a given song, every time they 
played it." 
"A lot of New York kids were our early 
following, as the hippie phenomenon was 
beginning. But we'd also get a lot of up-
town, middle-class. middle-brow, middle-
aged people, who would come in and 
giggle nervously away through the whole 
show. Most of the songs were Ed and 
Tuli's. Things like "Swineburn Stomp," 
"Wet Dream over You" and "Supergirl": 
I want a girl that can love like a monkey, 
hug like a castle, 
think like a darling, 
laugh like a lemon, 
eat like a monster, 
roar like a jug of wine. 
Supergirl, my supergirl 
"Ed Sanders did most of the singing, 
although Tuli did some in the early days. 
The rest of us did background harmony, if 
you could call it that. For a long time our 
music was very rough and ragged, and yet 
people preferred the first album to the 
second, because it was so ... patently what 
it was, so blatant. We had a program to 
follow during the shows, a strict format. 
It was presented as a kind of theater, "An 
Evening with the Fugs," with Playbills and 
all that. 
"The way the performance developed 
and continued, Ed Sanders had a continu-
ous monologue throughout the show, 
making various comments, introducing 
people and songs and talking to the audi-
ence. Tuli would go through costume 
changes and pantomimes, and Ken 
Weaver would act the part of some hid-
eous character like a bum on the Bowery 
or a faggot in Times Square, and Ed 
would be David Freakpuke interviewing 
him for the mass media. We also had Lee 
Cragtrec, who was a masterful keyboard 
pianist. But Lee would get so pissed off at 
the lack of musical organization or he'd 
have some metaphysical 'vector' inter-
ferring with Ed that he'd periodically 
stomp off stage in the middle of a song, 
and we wouldn't see him for a few days. 
"I was doing arrangements; Ed would 
construct a song and its lyrics and just 
work out a sketchy tune on the tape re-
corder. The rest of us would translate it 
into playable music. It was pretty clear by 
this time that Ed and Tuli and Ken were 
the Fugs and the other musicians were 
just sidemen. When we finally got to the 
point of incorporating ourselves, I was in-
cluded as one of the four principal Fugs. 
Not because I was making an equal con-
tribution, but because I was dependable, 
compared to the other people. I managed 
to get along with them all. 
"The summer was over, and I was 
tempted not to come back to New Haven, 
but I said I ought to try to make both 
scenes for a while. The first semester 
wasn't too bad and I went into New York 
to play on the weekends. I guess I got a 
fair amount of work done, but I was losing 
interest in English literature. The only 
bright spot was a paper I did on Milton, 
using Burroughs' Cut and Blend tech-
nique. I would transpose lines of Paradise 
Lost or blend them with other works, 
like Lawrence Durrell's Black Book. It's 
kind of like reading very free verse or 
looking at abstract art. You really have to 
be open to any possible significance. 
"It's kind of related to what the Fugs 
and other groups were doing at the time. 
There's really a difference between people 
'doing their own thing' at any given time 
and people obeying a certain formula 
even if that formula itself is governed by 
chance. The Burroughs method, which Ed 
Sanders turned me on to, is structured. It 
really seems more valid than no form 
whatsoever, like a lot of purported 'music' 
that consists of using any noise you hap-
pen to generate. We used to do a lot of 
that in the early days of the Fugs, and you 
know, it just begins to pall. 
"Second semester at Yale, things be-
came difficult because I was in New York 
every day recording for our second 
album. At that time there was a kind of 
identity crisis going on: Was I a student or 
a rock-and-roll star? I was really trying to 
lead two lives, and though it wasn't Yale's 
fault, the scene in New York seemed to 
offer me more. I was dropping courses, so 
I figured I'd better resign for a year.
