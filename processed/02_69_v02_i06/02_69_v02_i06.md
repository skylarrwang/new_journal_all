**Title: Old Blues and the CIA**
**Author: William L. Kahrl**
**Page number(s): 3**

Durell was a tall man, with a heavy musculature and thick black hair touched by gray at the temples. He wore inconspicuous dark suits, white button-down shirts, dark knitted ties. Aside from his height, and the way he carried himeslf-which a trained observer could identify as the walk of a dangerous man-he could lose himself in most crowds.


His Cajun accent no longer betrayed him, thanks to his years in New Haven where he picked up a Yale degree and some cash playing cards at Savin Rock. He had started in the business with G-2 and later transfered to the old OSS training ground at Pemberley during World War II. Afterward, he had known there could never be any other work for him, and he had been accepted by the Central Intelligence Agency of the State Department when it was first formed. It was lonely, dangerous, mean and dirty work for him, and the risks went unheralded by bugles.

Edward Aarons, Assignment: School for Spies

The career of Sam Durrell is not entirely a pulp-writer's fancy. Although the games at Savin Rock have long since folded, Yalies for the last quarter century have been leaving their lonely, dangerous, mean and dirty work as students to move from Yale into that ultimate closed corporation on the Potomac, the Central Intelligence Agency. Yale, in turn, through a relationship which neither organization has wished to publicize, has benefitted from a continuing exchange of personnel with the CIA. Today, an ex-CIA officer with fifteen years' experience is a special assistant to President Brewster, another is the University Chaplain, and many other former intelligence operatives teach in Yale's English and political science departments.

The CIA does not run Yale. It does not need to. The men from the CIA who are at Yale today are not active agents of an invisible government. It is disturbing, however, to note how closely the talents required of an effective Yale administrator correspond to those demanded of a good agent. Who for example, could be better suited to represent Yale to New Haven's black community than a man who could convince Adlai Stevenson that the United States had no interest in invading Cuba?

In any case, judging by the number of Yale men who have entered this branch of government service, it seems clear that there are no prevailing ethical standards embedded in the Yale education which preclude cooperation with a super-secret spy agency.

Like Yale, the CIA is basically a community of scholars surrounded by a legion of administrative agents of serviceable virtue who sustain the institution and carry out its bidding. The academic stamp has been on the American intelligence community ever since its founding after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Office of Strategic Services, the immediate forerunner of the CIA was, in fact, known as the "100 professors."

William Kahrl, Yale '68, recently left the graduate program in American studies to work with the Youth Division of the New Haven Police Department.

One of the first of those professors, Norman Holmes Pearson, professor of English and American studies at Yale, explains that scholars were first brought into intelligence work to plug the gaps in military thinking. The Army, for example, never considered the Library of Congress as an important intelligence resource; and yet, one could find there data of the annual rainfall in Tibet, the angle of the beach at Okinawa, the depth of the harbor at Marseilles-

in short, all of the factual material which is essential to an effective intelligence system. Consequently, Archibald MacLeish, then Librarian of Congress, was an early recruit of the fledgling OSS.

Wilmarth Lewis, Yale '18 and a member of the Yale Corporation until 1964, was brought in to establish a central registry of intelligence data based on the filing system he had developed for cataloguing the papers of Horace Walpole.

For many men of a bookish bent whose talents would not have been best applied on the front lines, the OSS afforded a chance for valuable service during the war. Among the men from Yale who joined at this time were Eugene Weyth; John Phillips, curator of the American Art Collection; Sumner Crosby; Bradford Wells; and Sherman Kent, who remained with the intelligence service until his retirement last year. To its critics, the OSS was composed of "a group of middle-aged specialists in anthropology, economics and a dozen other fields, plus a few young instructors who had had Ph.D. training in applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair of libraries." Pearson, a James Bond "M" of Bogart vintage who commanded counter-espionage for all of Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, recalls that his department was composed mainly of professors and lawyers: "Of the two, I preferred the lawyers because they had been trained to make up their minds on the evidence at hand, whereas professors prefer to meditate."

Although the academics played a leading role in organizing intelligence materials, the membership of the OSS was motley. As one veteran remarked, "In those days of the speeded-up draft and the scrambling for jobs, OSS was frequently the last refuge of the well-connected." The founder of the OSS, William J. Donovan, began by bringing in many of his old law partners and acquaintances to help him. Gradually, this "Old-Boy" network spread to include such diverse individuals as the millionaire Paul Mellon, movie director John Ford (who is scheduled to direct a history of the OSS with John Wayne as Donovan), a Yale tackle named George Seabury, Rene Dussaq ("the human fly") and the bartender from the New York Yale Club. As Pearson recalls, "It was a time for remembering people."

Pearson is a man well suited to such times, for his accumulation of well-known friends is as evident to the casual visitor as the bulk of his reading, and there is scarcely a foot of wall space in Pearson's three-room office (outside of the bathroom) which is not lined with books.

One of the more startling names of past acquaintances which Pearson has to recall is that of Kim Philby, the Russian double-agent. In his recently published memoirs, Philby remembers Pearson derisively as "the poet from Yale ... all 'hail fellow well met,' or 'have you heard the one about the lady on the bus.'" And Graham Greene at the time of Philby's defection commented in the Times that Philby had never been so great a threat to British security as Norman Holmes Pearson.

Pearson, who is a proponent of the theory that Philby went bad as a result of reading at an impressionable age Kipling's story of another Kim, reacts sharply to Philby's attack while concurring subtly with Greene's. He points out that while Philby as a Russian agent was rifting British desks, Pearson, as an American agent, was rifting Philby's. Thus, remarks Pearson with a wicked grin, "Philby was right to say that he was well rid of me, because he knew that I was kind."

The operational patterns established by the OSS later shaped the development of the CIA. Research and analysis by trained scholars is still the basis of the intelligence system, and the web of personal friends, school ties and useful acquaintances remains at the heart of the recruitment process. It should not be forgotten that the OSS was an exciting and colorful service as well. It was an organization which sent Tolstoy's grandson Ilya on a mission to the Dalai Lama in the forbidden city of Lhasa, and it gave a brave former Yale student, Roderick Hall, the chance to battle the German Army single-handed in an attempt to close the Brenner Pass to the Axis. Undoubtedly, the aura of adventure still accounts for much of the attractiveness of the espionage business. For example, CIA agent Herbert Itkin, indicted in New York for bribing a high city official, has been implicated in a plot hatched by two East-Side London crime czars to kidnap the Pope.

C. Tracy Barnes, who worked with the French underground during the war and later served with the CIA for nearly all of its history, agrees that for many years the intelligence service attracted men "who like to tear up the pea patch."

Phoenix

A while back, WYBC held a contest in which listeners were to complete the sentence, "If God were a Yale man .... "The winner, a sophomore at Connecticut College for Women, answered, "If God were a Yale man, there would be no second coming."

But Heracles, the prototypical hero, had to descend into Hades and return; James Bond returned from a garden of death in You Only Live Twice; and on a somewhat less mythical scale, The New Journal is back. Very honestly, we had to cancel the issue we had planned for the exam period. Besides the ridiculous amount of catching up that most of us had to do, there was also a financial problem or two. But the world is looking bright again, and we will be around this year and next year and as long aftenhat as there are people who want to put out a publication worth reading.

The New Journal is not a staid institution but is rather a few people who are excited by writing, editing, advertising, graphic design and general running around. We don't have heels or any type of formal competition: not that we are anarchists, but we feel most at home in our own personal chaos.

If you are interested in taking an integral part in publishing The New Journal, which is read by about three times as many people as any other Yale publication, whether ye be undergraduate, graduate student, faculty, faculty wife, student wife, please stop by our office in the basement (Room 50) of Silliman College on Wednesday, February 12, after 7:30.

There is an awful lot to be done, and we are looking for the handful of people who want to do it.


**Title: Barnes' nightmare**
**Author: Paul Goldberger**

Who plans Yale? Herb Short is damned if he knows, so he and Manfred Ibel, both students in the School of Architecture, created the Yale Planning Forum. When Short spoke the other night to members of Architecture 131b, a seminar on the Yale community, the talk was of power, people and pedestrian traffic routes. Beer can tops popped all over, and the scene was a far cry from the tinkle of sherry glasses in Woodbridge Hall.

"We clearly exist to usurp power," Short says. "We're going to advise the University just as does Ed Barnes' office." Barnes-better known to the outside world as Edward Larrabee Barnes, A.I.A.-is a New York architect and official planning consultant to Yale. "We're going to come up with our own concrete proposals," Short adds, "and if they're ignored-well, then some of us might become more than intellectual advisers."

As yet, "some of us" includes just Short and Ibel, so a mass student movement against Yale expansion plans hardly seems imminent. But the group plans to set up headquarters in a Chapel Street storefront and Short and Ibel will begin a full time effort to mobilize the Yale community on their first issue: the proposed Mellon Center for British Art and British Studies, slated to occupy the south side of Chapel Street between High and York Streets.

Yale secretly assembled the land before Paul Mellon's gift of a building and art collection was made public in December, 1966.

The Mellon Center epitomizes all that is wrong with Yale design, says the Planning Forum. While supporting the idea of a British Studies center, the group is concerned about the loss of a commercial block on Chapel Street. Chapel, Broadway and Wall Street are the lifeblood of the Yale campus, says Short- who claims the streets give Yale the human element Harvard Square gives Cambridge-and, by the present Mellon plan, the university is placing its institutional demands above the needs of the city and its own student community. Ditto, says Short, for Yale's projected housing, parking and classroom development throughout the campus.

The Mellon Center's architect is due to be chosen in early spring, and the Planning Forum hopes by then to have established itself sufficiently to speak for the student community. "I don't think anything will happen unless we force it to happen," Short says. "The people making decisions about space here see the University as a bunch of academic departments. We have to generate pressure on our side."

Part of this pressure, once the Mellon Center begins moving toward its 1973 target completion date, will be to force the University to include a mall of shops on the building's ground floor to replace the Chapel block. Shore also talks of designing the Center in conjunction with the planned Drama School building, proposed for the rear of the same block.

When the talk gets that long range, Short spews out plans faster than Ed Barnes ever dreamed possible. "There've been proposals to close off York Street," he says, "and make the old Drama School a film society headquarters and a student center. There's also talk of using Freshman Commons as a student center."

Warming up, Short shows the maps he prepared for his thesis presentation, which was based on the Yale Planning Forum. "Orbit," at first glance a sort of abstract version of a New Haven road map, shows the routes preferred by pedestrians across the campus. "They're in complete conflict with the University's plans," Short points out, "because students tend to walk where there's something to see and people to meet--or to take short cuts through buildings such as Woolsey Hall. But the axes are in any case different from those 'planned.'"

The Planning Forum seemed well on its way. Architecture 131b, a mixed bag of students from the Law and Divinity Schools as well as Art and Architecture and Yale College, couldn't find much to argue with in Herb Short's application of student power to the university planning process. Then someone raised the question of student interest, and Short admitted that was the group's problem. "We have to inspire more concern from undergraduates and non-architecture grad students," he said. He noted that most students are indifferent because of their transient position: "When you'll be out of here in four years, it's hard to see a need for concern. Yet students will, in the end, have to become involved. We looked at what was happening at Yale and we got incensed-the old Gothic campus sat in the center, and monolithic institutional buildings were spread around the outside with no relationship to one another. We're at a time of the biggest expansion since the 1930s, and a new image will have to grow out of that the people in the University want."

Finding what the people in the University want and making sure they can have it is what the Yale Planning Forum is for -whether it be a new art gallery, an expansion of library space on the cross campus, or just the guarantee of a place to get a cup of coffee at one in the morning.


**Title: Singer**
**Page number(s): 2, 15**

Out of the charivari of last week's Singer and ROTC issues, emerges a surprising similitude. For in the minds of some faculty sitting in Connecticut Hall last Thursday lurked the argument that the same academic bankruptcy in military training could be shown to lie behind any program that channeled the University's resources into the more practical needs of the immediate community. Such an attitude toward what Whitney Griswold called the "service station" functions of the state colleges seems to underlie the Singer Report itself.

Along with its idealistic, elitist underpinnings, the Report urges that University "contributions to public education will proceed from on-going research interests." Thus stated, without proceeding from the interests and needs of the community, the University's contribution will be that of the experimenting dandy playing piebald games among the locals. Without proceeding from the interests of Yale students, the University will contribute very little to "the contact with that world" that the Singer Report seems to hint is so necessary for the education of an elite. For while it is difficult, given the traditional role of the private, national university, to argue for its responsiveness to the particular needs of the immediate community, to argue for the provision of some direct confrontation with the social problems of the generation seems easier and certainly within the scope of an institution destining its members for leadership.

By its rhetoric, unfortunately, the Singer Report has come to bear more of the onus for Yale's response to the city than its authors claim. The report's concluding but altogether sketchy suggestions deserve some commendation. Inviting other local colleges to assist or handle Upward Bound and venturing jointly with independent private schools such as Choate to restructure pre-college preparation for black students are worthy impulses. Nevertheless, claims can be made that such ventures deal with such a paucity of students that they never affect the crux of the problem, the public school.

As for Yale's responsibility to develop new techniques and structural changes in the public schools, the Report sees Yale's much-touted Social Sciences Research Institute as a panacea. The recently announced Institute will include three centers for the study of contemporary social problems: the Center for Urban Studies, the Center for Urban Education, and the continued on page 15

**Title: The CIA: Liberals and Leftists**
**Author:  Unattributed**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

A Yale Institution for Upperclassmen 
During the Korean War, the CIA also 
offered the singular advantage of being 
one of the few government agencies where 
liberals and leftists could work without 
fear of the shadow of Joe McCarthy. Dur-
ing this period the CIA began its financing 
of the National Student Association for 
participation in leftist world youth fes-
tivals, and Allen Dulles, the CIA chief, 
took his stand against McCarthy in de-
fense of William Bundy. For liberals like 
New York Magazine editor Gloria 
Steinem, founder of the Independent Re-
search Service, the CIA was the only 
place to turn for funds to represent the 
United States at communist festivals 
abroad. For pea-patch terrors of the 
calibre of William Sloane Coffin, the CIA 
offered more: it offered "the chance to 
work on the side of Socialism against 
Communism." 

Reverend Coffin has always been dis-
creetly candid about the fact of his service 
with theCIAfrom 1950to 1953 and 
candidly discreet about the nature of his 
work tor the agency. He had not yet re-
ceived his call to the ministry. when he 
entered the service; he was interested in 
international relations and spoke fluent 
Russian. His assignments never brought 
him into the agency headquarters in 
Washington, and he left the CIA after 
three years with what he calls "a narrow 
impression of a pretty outstanding group 
of guys." Coffin still sees a few of his 
friends in the CIA and is proud of the 
personal ties that have survived politics. 
"They look on me as a traitor, and I 
look on them as murderers," he explains 
jovially. 

Liberals for the sake of Mr. Coffin's 
reputation and conservatives for the sake 
of the agency's undoubtedly would all 
prefer to believe that the agency which 
Coffin joined during the Korean War is a 
very different organization from the CIA 
today. Chances are that it is not. The CIA 
has continued to recruit intelligent liberals 
wherever it can find them, and on Viet-
nam, for example, the agency has main-
tained a relatively dovish stance. Coffin 
certainly does not regard this past associa-
tion as any blot upon his record, although 
it did cause some slight trouble when he 
was appointed to the Advisory Board to 
the Peace Corps at a time when Sargent 
Shriver was striving mightily to keep that 
organization free of CIA infiltration. 

According to C. Tracy Barnes, who bas 
been with the CIA for the last fifteen 
years, the agency bas changed. "Over the 
years there has been a gradual accumula-
tion of procedures ... tep.ding to keep 
out the pea-patch-tearer-uppers ... " 
Barnes should know. A Groton-Yale-
Harvard-Law graduate, he spent the war 
working with the French underground. 
From January to June, 1945, he worked 
with Allen Dulles in Switzerland arrang-
ing the surrender of northern Italy. After 
a few years of other government work 
and private law practice, Barnes went to 
work for Dulles again in the CIA in 1952, 
where he remained until 1967. His name 
bas appeared in connection with the 
agency on various occasions, notably as 
the most prominent liaison officer to the 
State Department during the planning of 
the Bay of Pigs invasion. According to 
Arthur Schlesinger in A Thousand Days, 
it was Barnes and he who, on AprilS, 
briefed Adlai Stevenson on the coming 
invasion. On the basis of that briefing, 
Adlai Stevenson stood up on the morning 
the boats bit the beaches to assure the 
nations of the world that the US had no 
part in the plot against Cuba. Schlesinger 
later admitted that the briefing may have 
been "unduly vague." 

Barnes was with the agency during its 
greatest growth period, under the Repub-
licans. Probably the full story of how the 
agency grew during this period will never 
be known: how, for example, McCarthy 
was kept out; how the FBI was beaten 
back in its attempts to encroach upon the 
CIA's sphere of activity; who was ulti-
mately responsible inside the executive 
branch for overseeing the agency's growth. 
Certainly the fact that the chief of the 
CIA, Allen Dulles, was the brother of 
the Secretary of State made for an in-
formal intermeshing of power which few 
departments of government could match. 
Also, the fears bred by the Cold War 
helped the agency, as Barnes explains, to 
see itself as "a necessary tool of govern-
ment policy." Wl\atever the combination 
of circumstances which Jed to this result, 
the CIA within a decade doubled its staff, 
acquired a budget half again as large as 
that of the Department of State, and hired 
a body of men more flexible, more experi-
enced and in some cases more influential 
than their counterparts in State. 


According to Tracy Barnes, this all 
changed with the Bay of Pigs debacle. 
"There was a change of attitudes. Until 
then, if the agency did exceed its limits, 
it d id so with the consent of the govern-
ment. After the Bay of Pigs, there was 
distrust of the agency within government." 
John F. Kennedy grumbled at the time, 
"I made a mistake in putting Bobby in 
the Justice Department .... Bobby should 
be in CIA. ... McNamara has dealt with 
Defense; Rusk has done a lot with State; 
but no one has dealt with CIA." 

In the spring of 1967, the CIA suffered 
a setback which was, in some ways, even 
more damaging: the disclosure of the CIA 
funding of the National Student Associa-
tion. In subsequent investigations, CIA 
money was found in everybody's pocket 
from MIT and the American Newspaper 
Guild to Norman Podhoretz. Before this, 
Barnes feels, except for occasional leaks 
agency critics "didn't have anything to 
get their hands on" unless they wanted to 
attack the agency as a governmental unit 
on ethical grounds. As W. Eugene Groves, 
President of the NSA at the time, re-
marked in a paper subtitled "Second 
Thoughts after the Storm": 

"In reacting to the CIA/ NSA expose, some 
Americans saw themselves almost directly 
threatened. Some saw a manifestation of 
what American society, and interpersonal 
relations within this society, ought not to be. 
At the same time, others saw nothing wrong 
with using secretive methods to fight out-
siders, 'them.' And conservatives saw their 
own economic and political interest jeopar-
dized by covert support of liberal groups, 
feeling that the money was given to the 
wrong people.'' 

Today, two years later, it is still difficult 
to assess the damage to the CIA. The 
agency's Covert Action Division #5, 
which handled most of the funding, has 
not grown new tentacles where the old 
ones were struck off; and the division 
head, Robert Kiley, a former president 
of NSA, has dropped out of sight. The 
Katzcnbach Commission appointed by 
the President in February, 1967, has put 
an end on paper to all covert funding of 
domestic organizations. But C.A.D. #5 
still exists, and it is a good guess that the 
money is still going out, only the vehicles 
have changed. 

More important, the agency may have 
lost the ability to regenerate its ideals and 
the capabilities of its personnel because 
of the damage the disclosures may have 
done to the agency's recruiting program. 
The NSA is one example. When the 
NSA decided to admit to its connections 
with the CIA, an attempt was made by a 
number of people connected with the asso-
ciation to investigate the relationship and 
make a full discloure of all the details. It 
became clear that the NSA through its 
international programs bad never been 
actively engaged in spying per se, nor had 
it ever been able to provide the agency 
with useful intelligence of any importance. 
The CIA admitted as much. Why then did 
the agency continue to finance the NSA 
for so long? 

The reasons accepted at that time had 
to do with internal disputes over recruit-
ing programs. There appeared to be a 
division within the CIA between the 
liberals of the OSS school and the later 
Dulles recruits generally described as 
"FBI-mentality" types. According to the 
story, the liberals were using the NSA as 
a recruiting resource to replenish their 
own ranks within the agency. 

CIA people today tend to discount 
this story, pointing out that such are-
cruiting plan could never have worked. 
They insist that there is no way of know-
ing that a man who is a liberal NSA 
staffer at twenty-two is going to feel the 
same way about world events after five 
years within the C IA. They explain the 
rationale for the NSA support much more 
simply, as nothing more than an attempt 
to build a base for influence within the 
ranks of the new generation of college 
students. To that extent, they argue, the 
NSA venture was a qualified success. 

But the opportunity for maintaining that 
influence has been lost, largely because 
of bad press. The CIA maintains no public 
relations office. In fact, it closed its public 
affairs office in Washington four years ago 
with the simple announcement that "a 
top-secret intelligence agency has no 
public affairs." For the agency, there is 
nothing to do but wait for the ill feelings 
raised by the disclosures of 1967 to sub-
side in time. In the meanwhile, Tracy 
Barnes admits that he has no idea "where 
the bright young liberal minds are going 
to come from."

**Author: Kenneth Keniston**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the course of the last year, the advanced 
nations of the world have been faced with an 
extraordinary and unprecedented upsurge 
of student unrest. New student tactics have 
taken hold in seventy nations of the world: 
everywhere the pattern has bee~ for .stud~~ts 
to occupy or seek to occupy thear un_aversattes 
until the demanded reforms are achaeved. In 
Czechoslavakia and France, students almost 
triggered major political revolutions .. I pro-
pose, here, to present a very speculauve.argu-
ment concerning the style and psycho-has-
torical situation that unite student protests 
in the more advanced nations of the world. 

One of the factors often cited as an expla-
nation of youthful unrest is the very large 
number of young men and women in the 
world under the age of thirty-which has 
become the critical dividing line between 
generations. But this fact alone does. 
not constitute an adequate explanataon of 
the revolutionary mood of many uni-
versity students. In all historical eras, the 
vast portion of the population has been 
under the age of 30. Indeed, in the most 
primitive societies, most people are dead 
long before they reach that age. If chrono-
logical youth alone were enough to 
insure rebellion, advanced societies, where 
a greater proportion of the population 
reaches old age than ever before in world 
history, should be the least revolutionary, 
and the most piimitive societies should 
be characterized by the greatest youthful 
ferment. This is not the case. 

What does matter, however, are two 
interrelated characteristics of the under-
thirties: first, the relationship of the young 
to the established institutions of the so-
ciety, that is, whether they are engaged in 
them or not; second, the opportunities 
the society provides for continuing intel-
lectual, ethical and emotional develop-
ment after the age of puberty. In both of 
these regards, the present situation in the 
more advanced nations is without any 
precedent. 

Philippe Aries, in his remarkable book, 
Centuries of Childhood, points out that 
until the end of the Middle Ages, no 
separate stage of childhood was recog-
nized in Western societies. Infancy ended 
at approximately the age of six or seven, 
whereupon most children were integrated 
into adult life, treated as small men and 
women, and expected to work as junior 
partners of the adult world. 

One crucial phenomenon in the more de-
veloped nations of the world today is the 
gradual recognition of another stage of 
life, one that like childhood and adoles-
cence before it, was previously allowed to 
only a small minority, but that is rapidly 
being extended to an ever greater group. I 
will call this the stage of youth, and by 
youth I will mean a further stage of disen-
gagement and development that intervenes 
between adolescence and adulthood. 

Kenneth Keniston is an associate professor 
of psychiatry at the Yale M edical School. 
He is the author o.f The Uncommitted and 
The Young Radicals. 

What is new about our present situa-
tion, then, is not that there are more young 
people, but that we have opened to larger 
numbers of them an extended period of 
disengagement and development that con-
tinues into the twenties and often until the 
thirties as well. We have created a new 
stage of life, at least for the more fortu-
nate in the more advanced nations, a stage 
of continuing disengagement from the 
adult structures of the society, a stage that 
provides opportunities for intellectual: 
emotional and moral development whach 
were not afforded to any large group to 
the same extent ever before in history. In 
the student revolts, we are seeing onere-
sult of this advance. 

I have called the extension of youth an 
advance advisedly. There is growing evi-
dence that, on the whole, attendance in a 
university is, all other things held con-
stant, a good thing for the individual in-
volved. Put in an oversimplified phrase, it 
tends to free him-to free him from 
swallowing unexamined the assumptions 
of the past, to free him from the super-
stitions of his childhood, to free him to ex-
press his feelings more openly and to f~ee 
him from irrational bondage to authonty. 

Available evidence indicates clearly that 
this is an effect of attendance at a uni-
versity, not a factor built into the selection 
process by which students are admitted. 

I obviously do not need to suggest that 
all college graduates or all student radi-
cals are free and liberated spirits, un-
encumbered by irrationality, superstition, 
authoritarianism or blind adherence to 
tradition. But as applied to individuals, 
these findings indicate that universities, far 
from only turning out machine-like 
robots who will provide skilled manpower 
for the economy, are turning out ever-
greater numbers of highly critical citizens, 
young men and women who have had the 
opportunity, the leisure, the affluence and 
the educational resources to continue 
their development past the point where 
most men and women in the past were re-
quired to stop it. 

One part of what we are seeing on 
campuses throughout the world is not a 
reflection of how bad higher education is 
but rather of its extraordinary accomplish-

ments on a historical scale. Even the moral 
righteousness of the student rebels, a 
quality both endearing and infuriating to 
their elders, must be judged at least in 
part a consequence of the privilege of an 
extended youth; for a prolonged develop-
ment, we know, permits the individual 
to elaborate a more personal, less purely 
conventional, sense of ethics. 

What the advanced nations have done is 
to create their own critics on a mass basis 
-that is, to create a larger and larger 
group of young men and women who take 
the credal values of their societies as their 
own, who internalize these values and 
identify them with their own best selves 
and who are willing to struggle to imple-
ment them. And at the same time, these 
same young men and women have been 
freed from the requirements of work, 
gainful employment and even marriage, 
permitting them to criticize their society 
from the protected position of disengage-
ment. 

But the mere fact of prolongation of 
psychological development need not auto-
matically lead to unrest. To be sure, we 
have granted to millions the opportunity 
to examine their societies, to compare 
them with their values and to come to a 
reasoned judgment of the existing order. 
But why should their judgment today be 
so unenthusiastic? 

What protesting students share, on a 
worldwide basis, is a mood more than an 
ideology or a program-a mood that says 
that the existing system, the power struc-
ture, is hypocritical, unworthy of respect, 
out-moded and in urgent need of reform. 
In addition, the complaint of repression, 
manipulation and authoritarianism is 
ubiquitous although paradoxical, given the 
apparently great freedoms given students 
in many nations. In America those who 
complain most loudly about being suffo-
cated by the subtle tyranny of the Society 
attend the institutions where freedom is 
in fact greatest. Around this general 
mood, specific complaints arrange them-
selves as symptoms of what they often 
call the "exhaustion of the existing so-
ciety." 

To understand this phenomenon, we 
must recognize that during the decades 
since the second World War, a number of 
societies have begun to move past the 
industrial era into a new world that is post-
industrial, technological, post-modem, 
post-historic or, in Brzyzinski's terms, 
"technectronic." In western Europe, the 
United States, Canada and Japan, the first 
contours of this post-industrial society are 
already apparent. And in many other less 
developed societies, middle-class profes-
sionals (whose children become activists) 
also Jive in post-industrial subcultures. 

Whatever we call this new kind of society, 
it has demonstrated that for the first time 
in history man can produce more than 
necessary to meet his material needs. 

This accomplishment is admittedly 
blemished by enormous problems of eco-
nomic distribution in the advanced na-
tions, and it is in terrifying contrast to the 
overwhelming poverty of the Third 
World. Nevertheless it has become clear 
that what might be called "the problem of 
production" can, in principle, be solved. 

If all members of American society, for 
example, do not have enough material 
goods, this is because the system of distri-
bution is flawed. The same is true, or will 
soon be true, in a number of other nations 
that are approaching advanced states of 
industrialization. Characteristically, these 
nations, along with the most techno-
logical, are those where student unrest has 
recently been most prominent. 

The transition from industrial to post-
industrial society brings with it a major 
shift in social emphases and values. Indus-
trializing and industrial societies, what-
ever their political organizations, tend to 
be oriented toward solving the problem of 
production. An industrial ethic--some-
times Protestant, sometimes socialist, 
sometimes communist-tends to empha-
size psychological qualities like self-dis-
cipline, delay of gratfication, achievement-
orientation and a strong emphasis on 
economic success and productivity. The 
social, political and economic institutions 
of industrializing societies tend to be or-
ganized in a way that is consistent with the 
goal of increasing production. And as 
many have noted, industrial societies tend 
to apply universalistic or uniform stan-
dards, to reward achievement rather than 
status acquired by birth, to emphasize 
emotional neutrality ("coolness") and ra-
tionality in work and public life. 

The emergence of post-industrial so-
cieties, however, means that growing 
numbers of youths are brought up in fam-
ily environments where abundance, rela-
tive economic security, political freedom 
and affluence are simply facts of life, not 
goals to be striven for. To such young men 
and women, the psychological impera-
tives, social institutions and cultural 
values of the industrial ethic seem largely 
outdated and irrelevant to their own life 
situations. 

When the young perceive that the prob-
lem of production has been or can be 
solved, when it has been solved in their 
own life-experience, they become unre-
sponsive, bored or "turned off" by values, 
institutions and psychological demands 
that originated in a society where produc-
tion was crucial. Once it has been demon-
strated that a society can produce more 
than enough for all of its members, at least 
some of the young turn to other goals: 
for example, trying to make sure that so-
ciety does produce enough and distributes 
it fairly, or else searching for outlooks 
arid life-styles that will enable them to live 
meaningfully with the goods and the 
leisure they already have. The problem is 
that our society has, in some realms, ex-
ceeded its earlier targets and, lacking new 
targets, has become exhausted by its suc-
cess. As a result, even though material 
conditions are in many respects better 
than ever before in world history, this era 
brings an unprecedented and surprising 
upsurge of student protest and unrest. 

When the values of industrial society 
become devitalized, the elite sectors of 
youth-the most affluent, intelligent, priv-
ileged and so on--come to feel that they 
live in institutions with imperatives that 
lack moral authority or, in today's jargon, 
"credibility." The moral imperative be-
hind production, acquisition, materialism 
and abundance has been lost. 

Furthermore, given the lack of moral 
legitimacy felt in "The System," the least 
request for loyalty, restraint or conformity 
by its representatives-for example, by 
college presidents and deans-is viewed as 
a moral outrage, an authoritarian repres-
sion or a manipulative co-optation. 

Thus, I suggest that the vague feeling of 
oppression voiced by so many.students 
springs from their feeling that the existing 
society has lost its ethical mandate and 
credibility, so any demand from that so-
ciety is an exercise in "illegitimate author-
ity" and must be exposed and resisted. And 
perhaps that peculiar sense of suffocation 
felt by dissenting students arises ultimately 
from living in societies without vital ethi-
cal claims. 

Given such a situation, it does not take 
much to trigger off a major protest. I 
doubt that school, college and university 
administrators are in fact more hypo-
critical and dishonest than they were in 
the past. American intervention in Viet-
nam, while many of us find it unjust, 
outrageous and cruel, is not in itself more 
outrageous than other similar imperial-
istic interventions by America and other 
nations within the last century. And the 
position of blacks in this nation, although 
disastrously and unjustifiably disadvan-
taged, is materially and legally better than 
ever before. Similarly, the conditions of 
students themselves in America have never 
been. so good, especially at those elite col-
leges where student protests are most com-
mon. But this is precisely the point. It is 
because so many of the other problems of 
American society seem to have been re-
solved or to be resolvable in principle that 
students now react with new indignation 
to old problems, turn to new goals, and 
propose radical reforms. 

So far I have emphasized the moral ex-
haustion of the old order and the fact that 
for the children of post-industrial afflu-
ence the once-revolutionary claims of the 
industrial society have lost much of their 
validity as a source of immediate per-
sonal motivation. I now want to argue that 
we are witnessing on the campuses of the 
world a fusion of two revolutions with dis-
tinct historical origins. One revolution is 
the old and familiar revolution of the in-
dustrial society, the liberal-democratic 
egaJitarian revolution which has not yet 
been completed in any nation of the world, 
the revolution that started, if you will, 
in America and France at the turn of the 
18th century and that has since spread to 
virtually every nation in the world. The 
other revolution is the new revolution, the 
post-industrial revolution, which seeks to 
define new goaJs relevant for the 20th 
and 21st centuries. 


--- Page 9 ---

In its social and political aspects, the 
industrial revolution has been a revolution 
of universalization, in the sociologist's 
awkward terms. It has involved the pro-
gressive extension to larger and larger 
numbers of people of economic, political 
and social rights, privileges and oppor-
tunities originally available only to the 
aristocracy, then only to the middle-class, 
and now in America, for example, only 
to the relatively affluent and white work-
ing class. It is in many respects a quantita-
tive revolution: that is, it concerns itself 
less with the quality of life than with the 
amount of political freedom, the quantity 
and distribution of goods, or the amount 
and level of injustice. 

In our own society, as we approach the 
targets of the first revolution on which our 
society was built, to be poor becomes out-
rageous; and even to witness poverty, dis-
crimination, exploitation and oppression 
in others becomes intolerable. In our 
own time, the impatience to complete the 
first revolution has grown apace, and we 
find less tolerance, less patience, less 
willingness to compromise and forgive 
among the young, especially among those 
who now take the values of the old revolu-
tion for granted-seeing them not as 
goals, but as rights. 

A subtle shift has thus occurred. What 
used to be utopian visions-for example, 
equality, freedom from discrimination, 
abundance-have now shifted to become 
demands-inalienable rights upon which 
one can insist without brooking any com-
promise. It is noteworthy in student con-
frontations that no one today requests 
anything: students present their "de-
mands". 

So on the one hand we see a growing 
impatience to complete the first, the lib-
eral-industrial revolution, to extend the 
economic, social and political claims of 
liberalism to all, a growing intolerance of 
a society where oppression, inequality 
and exploitation persist. But on the other 
hand, admixed with the demands of the 
old revolution is a second revolution con-
cerned with newer issues, a new revolution 
that is less social, economic or political 
than psychological, historical and cultural, 
a revolution less concerned with the 
~uantities of things than with their quali-
ties, a revolution that judges the virtually 
complete liberal revolution and finds it 
~till wanting. "You have to have grown up 
•n Scarsdale to know how bad things 
really are," said one radical student. 

This comment would probably sound ar-
rogant, heartless and insensitive to a poor 
black, much less to a citizen of the Third 
World. But he meant something important 
by it. He meant that even in the Scarsdales 
of America, with their affluence, their up-
per middle-class security and abundance, 
their well-fed, well-heeled children and ex-
cellent schools, something is wrong. Eco-
nomic affluence does not guarantee human 
fulfillment; political freedom does not 
yield inner liberation and cultural free-
dom; social justice and equality may leave 
one with a feeling that something else is 
missing in life. "No to the consumer 
society" shouted the bourgeois students of 
the Sorbonne during May and June of 
1968-a cry that understandably alienated 
French workers, for whom affluence and 
the consumer society are still central 
goals. 

What, then, are the targets of the new 
revolution? I approach this question with 
great diffidence, since I feel that if I, or 
anyone, could answer that question satis-
factorily·, we would indeed be prophets of 
a new age. As is often noted, students 
themselves do not know what these ob-
jectives are: they speak vaguely of "a so-
ciety that has never existed"; of "new 
values," of a more humane world; of "lib-
eration" in some psychological, cultural 
and historical sense. Their rhetoric is 
largely negative, and it is only indirectly 
that we can discern certain trends in the 
rhetoric of the student the world across 
that point to the still unformulated targets 
of the new revolution. 

First is a revulsion against the notion of 
quantity, particularly economic quantity 
and materialism, and a turn toward no-
tions and concepts of quality. One of the 
most delightful slogans of the French stu-
dent revolt was "Long live the passionate 
revolt of creative imagination." There is 
some sense in which the achievement 
of abundance may enable us to turn to 
examine, as only a few artists and mad-
men have examined in the past, the 
quality, intactness, joyfulness and zestful-
ness of our daily and immediate experi-
ence, including the interweaving of imag-
ination in our Jives. 

Another goal of the new revolution 
involves a revolt against uniformity, 
equalization, standardization and homo-
genization. At times this revolt approaches 
anarchic quaintness, but it has a strong 
positive core as well. This core is a demand 
that individuals be appreciated not be-
cause of their similarities or despite their 
differences, but because they are different, 
diverse, unique and non-interchangeable. 
The same pressure is evident in a thousand 
areas: for example, the insistence upon a 
cultivation of personal idiosyncracy, 
mannerism and unique aptitude; even the 
rejection of the melting-pot and con-
sensus-politics view of American life in 
favor of a post-homogeneous America in 
which cultural diversity is underlined 
rather than denied. 

The new revolution also involves a con-
tinual struggle against psychological or 
institutional closure or rigidity in any · 
form. Positively, it extols the virtues of 
openness, motion and continuing human 
development. What Robert J. Lifton has 
termed the protean style is clearly in evi-
dence in this new revolution. Fixity and 
rigidity of all forms is fought against, even 
the rigidity of a determinate adult role. As 
an alternative, there is emerging a concept 
of a lifetime of personal change, of an 
adulthood of continuing self-transforma-
tion, of an adaptability and openness to 
the revolutionary modern world that will 
enable the individual to remain with it, 
psychologically youthful and on top of the 
present. 

A final characteristic of the new revolu-
tion is the revolt against centralized power 
and the complementary demand for par-
ticipation. What is demanded is not merely 
assent by the governed, but the involve-
ment of the governed in the governance of 
their lives and their communities. The 
phrase "participatory democracy" of 
course summarizes this aspiration, but the 
aspiration extends far beyond that one 
phrase and the rudimentary social forms 
that have sprung up around it. The de-
mand for participation extends to the 
demand for relevance in education, that is, 
for a chance for the individual to partici-
pate as a human being in his own educa-
tional experience, in such a way that all of 
his faculties, emotional and moral as 
well as intellectual, are involved in his 
education. The demand for participation 
is also embodied in the new ethic of 
"meaningful human relationships" in 
which individuals confront each other 
without masks, pretenses and games, "re-
late" to each other as unique and irre-
placeable human beings, develop and 
devise new forms of relationships from 
which all participants will grow.

Mr. Fug joins long-range patrol 
by Jeff Pollock 
That which you have loved with youthful 
enthusiasm and admired with youthful ardor, 
that which you have secretly and mysteri-
ously preserved in the innermost recesses of 
your soul, that which you have hidden in the 
heart: that which you have learned to know 
bit by bit, like a bird gathering straws for its 
nest, happier over each separate little piece 
that over all the rest of the world; that you 
always approach with a certain shyness, with 
mingled emotions, when you know that the 
purpose is to try to understand it. I know 
that what I have hitherto understood is very 
little, so there will always be enough left 
behind. 

Sillren Kierkegaard, Either/ Or 

I floated lonely down the street one day, 
Who did I see slither my way 
Slum Goddess from the Lower East Side, 
Slum Goddess, gonna make her my bride, 
There's not a chick in the world who's half as 
hip as she 
My swinging little Goddess from Avenue D 
It's really very groovy 
To take her to a movie, 
Where we make it in the balcony. 

Ken Weaver, "Slum Goddess" 

Jack Anderson ·s apartment on Chapel 
Street is big and roomy. A few photos of 
army buddies in Vietnam and a little oil 
painting of some sunflowers that be did 
before going into the service grace the 
spotless white walls. The only other 
mementos from his three years away from 
Yale are a cigarette lighter inscribed, 
"John A. Anderson, Ill, First Infantry, 
Vietnam, June, 1967-July, 1968" and a 
crumpled old Playbill from "An Evening 
with the Fugs" at the Players' Theater. 
Jack offers us a seat on his trunk and 
settles back into a canvas Yale director's 
chair. It is the only piece of furniture in 
the room. 
"The summer after my freshman year 
at Yale, I worked at the New York World's 
Fair and lived in an apartment on the 
Lower East Side. I wandered around the 
neighborhood and heard about a rock 
group caJled the Fugs playing at the 
Bridge Street Theater. I went one night 
and talked to them and then met them 
again at the Peace Eye book store, which 
was run by their leader, Ed Sanders. They 
were all amazingly energetic guys. Ed got 
his B.A. in Greek and Latin literature 
from NYU and was a pretty active poet. 
He had worked at a tobacco stand on 
Times Square for a while until he got 
enough backing to open the Peace Eye. 
"The Pugs had really gotten going dur-
ing the previous winter. Ed had grown up 
with classical rock and roll in the fifties. 
He was high school class of '56 and a 
cheerleader at the time, you know: "Tough 
as nails, hard as bricks, Southwest High 
School fifty-six!" In fact, that's why Ed is 
in a footbaJI uniform on the cover of the 
Fugs' second album. 
"The other core members of the group 
were Ken Weaver and Tuli Kupferberg, 
an old-time New York anarchist and poet. 
Tuli has always had a tremendous follow-
ing, primarily of young girls. He's a very 
beatific person, like a kindly wise uncle, 
but it wasn't always totally platonic. He's 
not a dirty old man-he takes young girls 
to bed sometimes and just interdigitates 
with them. 
"My best friend was Ken Weaver. He 
was born a bastard in Texas and had some 
pretty traumatic times moving from one 
foster home to another. After four years 
in the Air Force as a Russian translator, he 
got a job working on Wall Street. As kind 
of a reaction to the service, he wore turtle-
necks to work and started letting his hair 
and beard grow. He eventually quit Wall 
Street and lived by donating blood for five 
bucks a pint. When I met him he was 
sleeping in the back room of Ed's book 
store.

"I was a guide that summer in the Fed-
eral pavillion at the New York World's 
Fair. The Fugs thought it was interesting, 
and I was a new kind of person for them 
to have as a friend, a Yalie. We made 
friends quickly enough so that there were 
no undercurrents-! laughed at them and 
they laughed at me. I bought a bass guitar 
and kind of joined up." 
"With the Fugs I played bass, Ken 
Weaver was on conga drum, and there 
were two other musicians who played as 
sidemen, Peter Stamfel and Steve Weber 
of the Holy Modal Rounders. The group 
was playing the old kind of music I used to 
like; we sung two William Blake poems 
in bluegrass and did rock and roll par-
odies. 
"Tuli and Ed had decided that they 
wanted to use rock and roll to convey 
poetry of their own. They had visions of 
merging modern poetry with modern 
music, which both of them appreciated as 
a classical idea. With Dylan's new music 
a Jot of rock was becoming poetic, and 
since I expressed an interest they indicated 
that they would like to have me along. 
"Obviously I didn't look like them 
much, because my hair wasn't very long 
and I didn't have a beard. But they were 
· the last people at that time to worry about 
any kind of image. In fact, later on my 
image became valuable as a sort of oasis 
of innocence. They accepted me on the 
basis of the contribution I made, which 
was dependability and some sort of orga-
nized music. You see, I could be counted 
on to play the same note roughly at the 
same time in a given song, every time they 
played it." 
"A lot of New York kids were our early 
following, as the hippie phenomenon was 
beginning. But we'd also get a lot of up-
town, middle-class. middle-brow, middle-
aged people, who would come in and 
giggle nervously away through the whole 
show. Most of the songs were Ed and 
Tuli's. Things like "Swineburn Stomp," 
"Wet Dream over You" and "Supergirl": 
I want a girl that can love like a monkey, 
hug like a castle, 
think like a darling, 
laugh like a lemon, 
eat like a monster, 
roar like a jug of wine. 
Supergirl, my supergirl 
"Ed Sanders did most of the singing, 
although Tuli did some in the early days. 
The rest of us did background harmony, if 
you could call it that. For a long time our 
music was very rough and ragged, and yet 
people preferred the first album to the 
second, because it was so ... patently what 
it was, so blatant. We had a program to 
follow during the shows, a strict format. 
It was presented as a kind of theater, "An 
Evening with the Fugs," with Playbills and 
all that. 
"The way the performance developed 
and continued, Ed Sanders had a continu-
ous monologue throughout the show, 
making various comments, introducing 
people and songs and talking to the audi-
ence. Tuli would go through costume 
changes and pantomimes, and Ken 
Weaver would act the part of some hid-
eous character like a bum on the Bowery 
or a faggot in Times Square, and Ed 
would be David Freakpuke interviewing 
him for the mass media. We also had Lee 
Cragtrec, who was a masterful keyboard 
pianist. But Lee would get so pissed off at 
the lack of musical organization or he'd 
have some metaphysical 'vector' inter-
ferring with Ed that he'd periodically 
stomp off stage in the middle of a song, 
and we wouldn't see him for a few days. 
"I was doing arrangements; Ed would 
construct a song and its lyrics and just 
work out a sketchy tune on the tape re-
corder. The rest of us would translate it 
into playable music. It was pretty clear by 
this time that Ed and Tuli and Ken were 
the Fugs and the other musicians were 
just sidemen. When we finally got to the 
point of incorporating ourselves, I was in-
cluded as one of the four principal Fugs. 
Not because I was making an equal con-
tribution, but because I was dependable, 
compared to the other people. I managed 
to get along with them all. 
"The summer was over, and I was 
tempted not to come back to New Haven, 
but I said I ought to try to make both 
scenes for a while. The first semester 
wasn't too bad and I went into New York 
to play on the weekends. I guess I got a 
fair amount of work done, but I was losing 
interest in English literature. The only 
bright spot was a paper I did on Milton, 
using Burroughs' Cut and Blend tech-
nique. I would transpose lines of Paradise 
Lost or blend them with other works, 
like Lawrence Durrell's Black Book. It's 
kind of like reading very free verse or 
looking at abstract art. You really have to 
be open to any possible significance. 
"It's kind of related to what the Fugs 
and other groups were doing at the time. 
There's really a difference between people 
'doing their own thing' at any given time 
and people obeying a certain formula 
even if that formula itself is governed by 
chance. The Burroughs method, which Ed 
Sanders turned me on to, is structured. It 
really seems more valid than no form 
whatsoever, like a lot of purported 'music' 
that consists of using any noise you hap-
pen to generate. We used to do a lot of 
that in the early days of the Fugs, and you 
know, it just begins to pall. 
"Second semester at Yale, things be-
came difficult because I was in New York 
every day recording for our second 
album. At that time there was a kind of 
identity crisis going on: Was I a student or 
a rock-and-roll star? I was really trying to 
lead two lives, and though it wasn't Yale's 
fault, the scene in New York seemed to 
offer me more. I was dropping courses, so 
I figured I'd better resign for a year.

"That spring I moved to New York, and 
we began to practice every day. Things 
weren't totally together, the drumming 
was still a problem, but it worked out. The 
music was really getting more coherent 
and more interesting. We were doing a lot 
of formal arranging, things that were 
more complex musically, something I had 
hoped for all along. I wanted to combine 
the songs that Tuli and Ed were writing, 
which I felt were really worthwhile, with 
music that would form a real rock-and-
roll ethos. We wanted to make some 
money to be able to continue to reach 
other people, and we saw the music as a 
kind of political action. 

"The music we were playing was pretty 
revolutionary. People talk about the songs 
of the Mothers of Invention; well, I guess 
we were the fathers of the Mothers. Their 
first album, Freak Out, was an idea that 
had been going on in New York for some 
time. We used to play at benefits with a 
group called the Falling Spikes, and to-
gether we'd be called the Transcendental 
Simulematic Orchestra; we'd play the 
background music for underground 
movies and light shows on dancing people, 
which was all starting at that time. The 
FaUing Spikes eventually became the 
musicians for Andy Warhol's group, the 
Velvet Underground. We referred to the 
music as acid rock and body rock and 
flesh rock and grope rock. A lot of those 
terms could really be ascribed to Ed 
Sanders, because he introduced a lot of 
terminology into the jargon that had been 
Times Square creep language. In fact, his 
position in the new linguistics was pretty 
central. 

"That summer we did a peace concert 
at Carnegie Hall. There was an archetypal 
black blues singer there, blind, who played 
the twelve-string guitar beautifully. He 
-started singing a slow spiritual song, and 
Joan Baez sort of popped into the room 
and joined in. Ken Weaver was drunk at 
the time and got into a big argument with 
Theodore Bike!, who kept pounding his 
chest and yelling that he had been a mem-
ber of the Movement for 30 years and we 
were just punks. I guess it was the voice of 
the Establishment. 

"The war was a pretty important issue 
among these people, even back in '64 and 
'65. At the time I felt the US was at least 
making a mistake if not doing something 
immoral. I was pretty involved, and I 
probably would have stayed with them for 
a year or so longer, or at least until I had 
decided to go back to Yale. The people I 
met were great: Harry Smith, Ted Berri-
gan and Alan Ginsberg, who is a friendly, 
open and warm guy who always gives you 
a friendly little grope when you see him. 
But then the Army moved into my life. 

"When I left Yale, it occurred to me that 
I might be drafted, but I intended to cop 
out, like so many people I know in New 
York. I had originally planned to appear 
before the physical board as a drug user 
and hope that they would reject me. The 
guys in the band didn't want me to go and 
offered to come with me and throw a big 
scene and help me put holes in my arms. 
But I was called up in the peak month of 
October, '66, and anyone with two legs 
was accepted. So it came down to a choice 
of going in peacefully or going to jail. And 
I doubted what support the Fugs could 
provide in a court case. 

"I really wasn't willing to be a martyr, 
although I thought it was a bad idea to 
become involved in the army. I was really 
questioning myself, because I couldn't be 
sure that my motives were pure. Although 
I felt that this war was a bad thing, I also 
believed that it was an inevitable function 
of human civilization and that it probably 
wouldn't end in my lifetime. Most of my 
opposition was just a feeling that I didn't 
want to be interrupted, that I didn't want 
to be bothered. 

"When it came down to my actual in-
duction scene, it was pretty long and pain-
ful and rather traumatic. I was regarded 
as being a freak because I had long side-
burns and fairly long hair. So on the way 
down to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, I 
ducked into a barbershop and got a straight 
haircut; I wasn't about to give any Army 
barber some kind of orgasm from cutting 
my hair. At Fort Jackson, it was complete, 
total disorientation. The whole idea of 
Army training is to give you a feeling of 
isolation and unfamiliarity that empties 
you out and makes you receptive to the 
military way. 

"At the time, I wasn't feeling sorry for 
myself. As soon as I accepted the fact that 
I was in the Army, I decided to devote my 
energies to doing a good job, so that I 
wouldn't get harassed more than neces-
sary. I tend to be fairly practical and prag-
matic anyway, and I had such a feeling of 
academic failure in the back of mind that 
it was a relief to do well on the tests they 
gave us in basic. 

"The reaction among Gis to my being a 
Yalie and a former Fug was one of sur-
prise, but I didn't get much of a hard time. 
Our platoon became very close as a unit, 
and none of the others did. It was great to 
be part of cohesive, working group, some-
thing I guess I wanted with the Pugs. I 
found it easy to see what was demanded of 
me and to perform without feeling that I 
was really being changed. It was a kind of 
resuscitation period. It had occurred to me 
that the Army would be a kind of interest-
ing time out, and when I finally got in, I 
decided that I would use the two years to 
become physically and mentally fit. 

"I was assigned to be a radio operator 
in a stateside base, although I had re-
quested to be a medic. I had hoped that 
I would have time to do some writing, but 
at the end of every day we'd all go off and 
get drunk or high. I had a lot of free time, 
and I would go up to New York all the 
time in those first months to see the Fugs. 

"Most of the guys drafted were afraid 
or didn't want to go to Vietnam, and they 
didn't volunteer for infantry or armor.! 
didn't want to be the company peace creep, 
because I didn't see how it would do any-
thing. I was able to work some people 
around to a kind of skepticism, but you 
begin to get the feeling of kinship with the 
poor Gis who are no better nor worse than 
you but are over there anyway. In April I 
found out that I was going to Vietnam; my 
orders came in the last week of June, and 
I left on July 27." 
Jack is surprisingly casual about the 
transition from Fug musician singing "Kill 
for Peace" and participating in the early 
peace protests to a radio operator in South 
Vietnam. He was assigned to a twelve-
hour night shift with the Signal Corps and 
spent most of his free time reading and 
relaxing.

Center for Management Studies, centers 
that will magically loosen the depart-
mental bonds to release social scientists 
to study broader, concrete problems. Such 
researches might eventually influence edu-
cational and social policy and in the long 
run actually implement policy by the 
training (perhaps) of a few teachers and 
bureaucrats. 

For the more immediate problems of 
New Haven, the Singer Report affirms the 
suggestion in Brewster's current annual 
report that Yale help initiate a Yale-New 
Haven Community Corporation which 
might include housing and educational 
corporations. What relations, however, 
will occur between such a corporation and 
the departmentalized researches of the 
Center for Urban Education? Relations 
that will guarantee undergraduate, grad-
uate and community participation, or re-
lations that will insure convenient research 
material for academics? Will the Center 
for Urban Studies, for example, commit 
itself to the Yale-New Haven Housing 
Corporation to explore as well as estab-
lish new ways to house both the coming 
influx of Yale students and the disad-
vantaged citizens of New Haven? 

Such questions can be asked not to un-
derscore the limitations of the Singer 
Report but to challenge rightfully the way 
it was subsequently publicized and han-
dled. For it would seem that if the gist of 
the Report is simply to offer guidelines 
and if thus students, the community and 
faculty must combine to implement its 
suggestions, then something very different 
from an 'acceptance in principle' by the 
administration is needed. The Yale Daily 
News reporter conscientiously following 
the Report this past week called for more 
information and discussion. It is ironic 
that he was soon shut off from sources of 
information. Strange too that there should 
be concerned faculty in the Schools of 
Law, City Planning and Architecture, and 
in the Master's Teaching Program who 
have little knowledge of Yale's urban 
involvement and small insight into the 
nature of the university's projected co-
operation with the city. Will such urban 
programs continue to be distilled in Wood-
bridge Hall, refined in the mysterious alem-
bics of Mssrs. Fanton and Fleishman? 


**Title: The New Politics**
**Author: Robert Lamm**

Brook.Jyn's St. George Hotel is old and 
tarnished; thus, its choice as the scene of 
a statewide conference of Coalition for 
a Democratic Alternative may have been 
ominous. The theme of the January 18 
meeting was "Toward a New Democratic 
Coalition." By the middle of the morning, 
I had placed a question mark at the end 
of that phrase on my program. 

The collection of people there was in-
triguing, if not bewildering. They ranged 
from Robert Lowell to Norman Mailer, 
from Paul O'Dwyer to Stanley Steingut. 
One thing was certain. Everyone who was 
anyone in left-liberal Democratic circles 
in the state of New York managed to make 
an appearance. 

In the morning I wandered into a panel 
on "The Future of the New Politics"; the 
panelists included Peter Fishbein, an at-
torney and former aide to Robert Ken-
nedy; Newfield Gorman, a speechwriter 
for the McCarthy campaign; Jack New-
field of the Village Voice; and Neal 
Hurwitz of Columbia's Students for a Re-
structured University. 

Fishbein began legalistically. For him 
the New Politics included both the Mc-
Carthy and Kennedy campaigns, which he 
conveniently lumped together, a practice 
that began, as I can best recall, the day 
after the New Hampshire primary. What 
the New Politics did not include for 
lawyer Fishbein, old beyond his years, 
were those bad boys from the New Left; 
and he soon proceeded to raise the spectre 
of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Ger-
many. He was living proof that former 
Socialists like Irving Howe and everyone's 
parents are not the only ones who can 
draw inadequate comparisons. 

Paul Gorman was the angry young man 
of the panel, and he voiced disaffection 
even with the now-controversial star of the 
show, Eugene McCarthy, whose after-
noon appearance everyone eagerly 
awaited. Gorman spoke of the need for a 
redistribution of power in America, rais-
ing up the old demon of the military-indus-
trial complex (now the military-industrial-
space complex) and pointing to the need 
for leadership which had no stake in main-
taining the present institutions. 

In the afternoon I spent most of my 
time at a panel on the future of the Demo-
cratic state organization of New York. It 
began with a speech by Michael Harring-
ton, who is a member of what someone 
called the Albert Shanker school of New 
Politics. Harrington spoke of the need 
for a new party within the Democratic 
Party. He took great pains to remind 
everyone, especially intellectuals, that la-
bor was essential to the new coalition. 
You know, I saw labor, especially in New 
York City, as part of the old coalition, the 
military-industrial-labor complex. 

Ted Sorenson, whose interests in a 
revitalized Democratic Party are un-
doubtedly altruistic (though presumably 
he would accept a legitimate draft for the 
Senatorial nomination in 1970), spoke 
later and went out of his way to praise 
that famed anti-machine politician, Sena-
tor Abraham Ribicoff-never a bad idea 
in New York Democratic circles if you're 
canvassing for support. That raised in my 
mind the old lingering question of how 
such a dedicated anti-machine politician 
as Senator Ribicoff got where he did in 
such a dedicated machine state as John 
Bailey's Connecticut. 

The CDA Conference was a testament 
to the old notion that politics makes 
strange bedfellows. This was nowhere 
more evident than when the panel was lec-
tured by the latest hero of the New Poli-
tics in New York, State Chairman John 
Burns, accused of cheating the McCarthy-
ites out of at-large delegates to the Con-
vention last June. Burns was later to be 
hissed a bit by less forgetful members of 
the audience and defended by none other 
than Paul O'Dwyer. It is indeed depress-
ing that the New Politics has sunk so low 
that Paul O'Dwyer is forced to defend 
John Burns. 

Well, the best is always saved for last. 
There he was, Don Quixote himself, fresh 
from a vote for Russell Long and a favor 
for Gale McGee to tell us all about the 
New Politics in 1969. Gene McCarthy 
still held the hearts of the crowd, though; 
they stood (not all, but most) and cheered 
wildly. 

McCarthy, praised in an introduction 
by Paul O'Dwyer for having the courage 
to debate Joe McCarthy in the 1950s and 
challenge Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s, 
was not about to duck the questions on 
everyone's mind. First came the bitter-
ness of the man. As some in the audience 
began to indicate their displeasure for his 
jokes about his recent actions in the 
Senate, Gene went after the jugular. He 
had gone up to New Hampshire to hunt 
big game in the person of Lyndon John-
son, but a lot of people, a Jot of these 
rabbit-hunters, had not gone with him. 
They had stayed home though he had in-
vited them to come a few times. Then, 
later on, they came. Old Gene was not 
about to be put on the defensive by any 
Kennedyites around. 

Bitterness was not all, though. Mc-
Carthy spoke of the need for changes in 
people and politics and political processes 
in the USA. He spoke of the need for a 
movement centered around the people and 
not around leaders, a movement that was 
its own and not his. He indicated that if 
the movement were so dependent on his 
vote for Senate whip and on his presence 
on Foreign Relations, it was really in bad 
shape and perhaps had misjudged him. 
It almost seemed that Gene had deliberate-
ly wished to destroy the hero-worship sur-
rounding him. Perhaps not surprising for 
a man who was always more anti-hero 
than hero. The man is strange and egotisti-
cal and arrogant; but if he hadn't been, he 
might never have run against LBJ and we 
might all be the worse off because of it. 

The real probJem is that the New Poli-
tics, CDA style, is not new enough. The 
predominance of middle-aged and middle-
class people at the conference was not in-
spiring. Their hearts may be in the right 
place, but their understanding of the issues 
and power realities in America is often 
limited. 

Looking around the CDA convention, . 
and even listening to Lowenstein and Mc-
Carthy, I could sense why McCarthy's 
speechwriter Paul Gorman had become 
discontented. People were talking about 
making radical changes in the quality of 
our national life but were not talking about 
radical tactics or even about radical pro-
grams. It was a not-so-New Politics that 
day at the not-so-new St. George Hotel. 


**Title: Random thought**

Random thought 
Dr. Arthur W. Galston, chairman of the 
faculty's committee on the course of 
study, said, "ROTC is like singing in the 
Whifienpoofs-a perfectly fine activity." 
If you have the choice, may we suggest 
the latter. 


**Title: Club sandwich**

Club sandwich 
Every night, the old United Restaurant on 
Chapel Street used to feed, and occasion-
ally poison, generations of book-weary 
Yale men. The greasy floors, the ever-
present smoke and the Early Attic decor 
lent a charm to the United that brought a 
few tears at its demise nearly three years 
ago. At some point since then, Yale pur-
chased the property and converted the old 
greasy spoon into the United Restaurant 
Art Gallery. 

The spirit of the old United was re-
captured for us last week when we received 
an invitation to the opening of the latest 
gallery event, screened on old United place 
mats. A two-man show by Bruce Mcintosh 
and Frank Mouris, students in the graphic 
design program at the Yale School of An 
and Architecture, in a way thematically 
describes the full menu of graphic design 
as "the club sandwich" of the visual arts. 

Against the gray dampness and stale 
beer aroma of the old building, the show 
itself offers a freshness and variety of 
theme that is a tribute to the range of these 
two artists. Assemblages, sculptures, de-
signs, collages, and Rauschenberg-type 
rubbings fill the gallery. Significantly, 
these mixed-media forms represent the 
personal and highly individualistic atti-
tudes of the artists towards their presenta-
tion and subject matter. 

"Maybe it goes back to my childhood," 
insists Frank Mouris, who majored in 
Architectural Sciences at Harvard before 
coming to Yale, "but I can't bear to throw 
anything away. I have a thing about baby 
shoes, old gloves, weathered pieces of 
wood; things that people throw away. And 
I try to give them a new meaning by plac-
ing them in an unusual context. The same 
is true of the pieces of magazine that I use 
in my collages. The juxtaposition of ad-
vertizing symbols and magazine photos 
make people more visually aware of the 
idioms they take for granted every day. 

"One of the more striking examples of 
what I mean is in the sculpture titled 
'Prominent Member.' There was an old 
porch pillar lying behind our house for a 
whole summer. The trashmen refused to 
take it away. I cut it into an old piece of 
driftwood that I found in Maine, and it 
worked beautifully. I mean it represents 
'a study of surface textures in a wood 
sculpture' but it's also the most ,.--ouc thing 
I've ever seen." 

This combination of a satiric sense of 
humor and a more serious search for new 
means of visual expression gives the work 
of both artists an exuberance and vitality 
that makes the show almost a dramatic 
event. 

"It's a matter of total visual communica-
tion," insists Bruce Mcintosh, a former 
student at Rhode Island School of Design 
and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Brown. 
"I find the arbitrary divisions within the 
arts really meaningless. Why all the boun-
daries between sculpture, painting, film 
and graphic design? I hope my work makes 
people forget the critical labels, and rather 
see the beauty in the interrelation of 
themes and styles. 

"I feel that the show is a kind of per-
sonal history for me. It includes work 
from over a long period, and it lets me see 
where my work has come from and where 
it is going. There is a personal rhythm in 
seeing component parts in several different 
forms. The same things appear in the cal-
endar assemblage, in the rubbings, and in 
the collages that indicate some of the com-
mercial and social idioms that bug me. 

"Things like flags and eagles, the whole 
Americana bit, has been a hang-up for a 
long time. A brutal juxtaposition of some 
of the phony things we say and the visual 
emblems we accept can be strikingly 
beautiful, visually, as well as socially 
meaningful. I hope the tension created 
by the crossing of themes and media can 
shake people enough to let them experi-
ence art openly, to let them share the 
excitement I feel and want to communi-
cate."
