In trying to join the Women's Center, Students for Life challenged basic political 
assumptions about feminism. Can the women's movement afford a pro-life wing?

Instead of writing on walls or screaming at roommates, try a body massage or cognitive

Another Course 
Saffron-robed and bald, beating drums 
and crashing cymbals, they color Elm 
Street 
with 
otherworldly designs. 
Yalies with designs for this world only 
turn their heads and scuttle to the 
safety of Cross Campus. The Hare 
Krishnas are in town, and apparently 
they're here to stay. 

The Krishnas, who first appeared in 
New Haven in 1973 and spent two 
months selling books on the Green, 
have returned periodically to conduct 
educational programs at Dwight Hall. 
But according to Acaryadeva, the cur-
rent chairman of the International 
Society for Krishna Consciousness 
(ISKCON) and a visiting lecturer in 
New Haven, "the Krishnas are perma-
nent." 

The principle lure of New Haven is 
Yale. As Acaryadeva explained, the 
Krishnas plan to establish temples in 
academic centers where "some of the 
most intelligent people tend to con-
gregate," and 
to 
cultivate "an 
enlightened class, ideal in its conduct 
and enlightened in spiritual 
knowledge." This enlightened class, 
they hope, will guide America to a 
spiritual awakening. 

Steve Shutt, a Yale history Ph.D. 
candidate 
who 
teaches meditation 
classes in Dwight Hall and is familiar 
with ISKCON, asserted that the pre-
sent group of Krishnas is well-suited to 
Yale. He feels that they use an ap-
proach significantly different from the 
shock tactics and psychological.tinker-
ing commonly associated with the 
Krishnas. Pointing to their knowledge 
of Western and Eastern culture and 
religion, Shutt said that the New 
Haven Krishnas seem very intellec-
tually inclined. 

About 500,000 people have joined 
the Krishna movement in the United 
States since it appeared in New York 
City in 1965. The movement began in 
India 5000 years ago and has gathered 
a large international following. It is

based on extensive literary sources, 
primarily the writings of the Lord Sri 
Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita. Accor-
ding to Acaryadeva, through a strict 
program of chanting, diet, and discus-
sion, Krishna devotees attempt 1'to at-
tain a spiritual knowledge that will 
purify their soul and bring them to a 
higher and expanded consciousness." 

Acaryadeva established a new center 
last May on Park Street to bring this 
opportunity to New Haven and Yale. 
Its doors are open to the inquisitive on 
Thursday evenings for informal 
discussion about reincarnation, 
spirituality, and existentialism over a 
meal of homemade vegetarian pizza 
and pear juice. On Sunday evenings 
the Krishnas hold a more formal pro-
gram of chanting, a lecture and discus-
sion, 
followed 
by 
a 
multi-plate 
vegetarian feast. 

Even though several Yale students 
have attended these sessions, the 
Krishnas have not received the over-
whelming response from them that 
they had hoped for. Dina Diya, a first-
year student in the nursing school's 
nurse-midwifery program and a Krish-
na devotee of 15 years, feels that the 
Krishnas will have a greater influence 
on the community as people become 
more aware of the movement. 

The Krishnas' parade, or "hari 
nama," has introduced many Yale 
students to the group. "That really 
scares people," admitted Sarvatma, an 
Argentinian who left his editorial posi-
tion on a surrealist Uruguayan news-
paper and now runs the Park Street 
center. "Most people respond with 
wilderment, but some brave ones· have 
spoken to us." Acaryadeva added, "We 
have to go out and meet people. We 
have a lot of communicating to do."

Place of Refuse 
Sometimes people forget. "There's 
nothing sadder than an empty porch," 
said Becky Seashore (TD '88), who as 
co-coordinator of the Compost Co-
operative makes morning van runs 
twice a month to pick up recyclable 
food wastes from the homes of the 
Coop's members. Apart from the occa-
sional absent compost bucket, how-
ever, Seashore and her colleague-in-
'compost, Betsy Lyman (For. '88), find 
their involvement in the Compost 
Cooperative a satisfying way to exer-
cise their ideals as environmentalists 
and to generate awareness about 
wasted resources. 

The Coop, now in its second year, 
hopes to exceed last spring's final 
membership of 79. Although most 
members among this year's increasing 
roster of 35 study at the Yale Forestry 
School, participants include a smatter-
ing of Yale professors and under-
graduates, as well as one rabbi. 

Members of the Coop agree to collect 
their leftover foodstuffs in a five-gallon 
compost bucket and to donate them to 
the Coop every two weeks. In addi-
tion, members divide the cost of gar-
bage bags, buckets, xeroxing and 
gas- a total contribution of under ten 
dollars a year for each participant. 

Finally, each member is asked to take 
part in the dirty work, joining the two 
coordinators in one hands-on compost 
pick-up run per year. 

Although one member characterized 
the pick-up run as an activity after 
which "you just come home feeling 
gross," Coop members consider the in-
convenience worthwhile because it 
...

feeling gross." 
gives them an opportunity to return 
organic materials to the soil, rather 
than allowing them to be dumped into 
a city landfill. Seashore emphasized 
the value of overcoming the en-
vironmental limitations imposed by 
living in a city. In addition, she admit-
ted, "com posting is just a helluva lot of 
fun." One diversion in which com-
posters indulge is to guess the intimate 
details of other members' lives by ex-
amining their discarded leftovers. "All 
of a sudden there will be a half bucket 
of coffee grounds," said Seashore, "and 
you'll know this person is stressing 
out." 

The Coop's pick-up crew transports 
the leftovers from each home to the 
Forestry School for collection by Yale's 
uncrowned king of compost, Peter P in-
chot (For. '88). From the organi-
zation's inception last 
year, 
Pin-
chot has been the sole recipient of the 
hundreds of gallons of compost 
generated by members every month. 
When last measured, his burgeonipg 
compost heap was twelve feet long, fo:Ur 
feet wide, and over two-and-a-half feet 
tall. Pinchot uses the compost to help 
fertilize vegetables on his small private 
farm in Guilford, feeding his family 
with the produce he grows. 

Although Pinchot. may seem a bit 
hard to satisfy when it comes to 
organic matter, asserting that "I always 
want more compost," the Coop has an-
nounced that he is "more than willing 
to share" his collection of decomposing 
food scraps. At least one other Coop 
member, Professor Bill Burch of the 
Forestry School, plans to take h im up 
on the offer. 

Seashore says that the Coop's ar-
rangement is not ecologically flawless, 
pointing out that those who use com-
post would ideally produce it them-
selves. Still, she feels that "all these 
things should be done in the end 
because they're fun and they bring peo-
ple together." She would like to see the 
Coop renamed The Leftovers Alliance 
and imagines the perfect compost run 
as an affair which would include capes 
for all participants, a blaring red siren, 
and a mounted compost bucket for the 
roof of the van "like those rotating 
K entucky Fried Chicken buckets."

Measuring Up 
Sung Kwak straightened the tie of h is 
tuxedo and took a last glance in the 
mirror. It was concert night for the 
New 
H aven Symphony Orchestra 
(NHSO), and in 15 minutes Kwak 
would lead the orchestra's 85 musicians 
through a program of Mozart, Men-
delsohn, 
and 
Tchaikovsky. 
Kwak 
moved about backstage with a conduc-
tor's composure. Would the concert go 
all right? H e flashed a quick smile. "I 
hope so." 

Kwak was the first of five finalists 
competing to succeed Murry Sidlin, 
music director of the NHSO for the 
past 11 years. According to violist 
Marvin Warshaw, the NHSO became 
a "more respectable orchestra" under 
Sidlin's guidance. Richard Lightfoot, 
chairman of the search committee 
which will select Sidlin's replacement 
next May, claimed that "Murry built 
the orchestra." The N HSO hopes to 
find someone who will follow Sidlin's 
lead. 

When the N H SO announced their 
search for a new director in 1986, they 
received over 275 applications from 
across the nation. The search commit-
tee, 
which 
includes 
three board 
members, two musicians, and the or-
chestra's general manager, rejected 
about half of the candidates, citing in-
adequate credentials. The search com-
mittee requested recordings from 50 
applicants and eventually proposed 
five finalists after more than a year of 
biweekly meetings. 

The NHSO chose applicants "in the 
ascendant portion of their career," 
Lightfoot said. He pointed out that 
New Haven has a reputation for being 
an "arts-intensive community" and that 
the new director must consequently 
show a great deal of artistic leadership. 

Kwak, the current music director of 
the Austin Symphony Orchestra and a 
former 
conductor 
for 
the J offrey 
Ballet, seems to have the necessary 
credentials on paper. But Lightfoot 
stressed that a resume does not stand 
alone. "We have a sophisticated au-
dience and a reputation for adven-
turous programming," he said. "We 
can't have someone who is archival." 

Paul Kantor, one of the two musi-
cians on the · search committee, said 
that the orchestr'i members also want 
an exciting leader- someone "inspired 
and inspiring." Kantor pointed out 
that the selection process, in which 
musicians and management work to-
gether, differs from that of many or-
chestras. ''Here," he said, "the board 
members have been very open to the 
musicians' comments. They really 
have listened to what we have to say." 

The musicians have a chance to get 
to know each finalist during a week of 
meetings and social events. Kwak, 
who visited New H aven in October, 
also 
met with NHSO fundraising 
groups, staff, and volunteers and held 
a press conference for local media. But 
the focal point of Kwak's stay was the 
time he spent with the orchestra-ap-
proximately 13 hours spread over five 
rehearsals. According to Kantor, this 
is a "luxurious amount of time" to 
prepare for a concert. At the end of the 
week, Kwak led the orchestra in front 
of an enthusiastic crowd in Woolsey 
Hall. · 

After the concert, K wak changed 
from his tuxedo into a conservative suit 
and tie. Musicians came to shake his 
hand, and a friend brought roses. 
Asked if it was a good concert, Kwak 
beamed and replied, "It was a good 
week." Four . other conductors now 
stand between h im and his next New 
H aven audience.

Between the Vines/ Ann Wierda · 
The Body Politic 
"Look around Yale. You don't see a 
pregnant woman walking around this 
campus." 

A woman defending the pro-choice 
stance on abortion was speaking at a 
recent forum. True enough, I thought. 
I did not even have to pause ·in an 
attempt to recall any pregnant women 
I might have seen in class, in the 
library, in the dining hall. I followed 
her subsequent pro-choice arguments 
also without a pause. 

Unplanned 
pregnancy disrupts 
woman's 
education and employment, many 
times leaving her in economic and 
emotional 
despair. These familiar 
arguments defending the right to 
abortion provide the basis for my own 
feminism. 

Two days later, as I sat across a 
dining hall table from three women of 
Students 
Life, 
pro-life 
organization on campus1 that basic 
understanding seemed vaguely 
threatened. The lac~ of direct clash 
between their pro-life arguments and 
my pro-choice beliefs bewildered me. 

Over and over, these women threw out 
the same words, the same rhetoric, 
that I had heard in the mouths of pro-
choice believers. As we talked, I had 
the strange sensation that words had 
separat~'d from meanings and were 
floating freely around the table. 

"Look around Yale," Shannon 
Summers (BR '90) said. "You don't see 
a pregnant woman on this campus." 
She continued, "This institution is 
not gtvmg women options. It 1s 
sending out 
signals 
that 
woman cannot have a baby and be a 
student here. There is no room for a 
pregnant woman at Yale." The degree 
to which her argument reflected rr:y 
assumptions about a woman's choice 
disconcerted me. Yes, a woman should 
have the option. to have a child, if she 
so chooses. Yes, there should be a 
"place" for a pregnant woman. But 
does this reasoning constitute a "pro-
life" argument or a 
"pro-choice" 
argument with a different emphasis? 

And does feminism have room for both 
ideologies? 

I heard the strong words of Katie 
Oberlies(LA W '88):"I am a member of 
6 The New JournaVDecember 4 , 1987 
Students for Life, and I am a feminist." 
To this woman, the right to abortion 
did not lie at the center of feminism. 
She did not expect her stance on the 
issue to place her outside the move-
ment. Then she and other members of 
Students for Life sought inclusion in 
the Yale Women's Center. The Center 
decided that the right to abortion 
contained such 
basic femionist 
significance- a 
woman's right 
privacy in terms of her own body- as 
to make it a 
definitive line for 

Feminists could 
have 
differing opm10ns on prostitution, 
pornography, or the ERA, but not on 
abortion. Students for Life fell on the 
wrong side of the line and found 
themselves defined out of feminism 
and the Center. 

Traditional definitions of feminism 
exclude many women from 
the 
women's movement, just as they 
exclude Students for Life from the 
Women's Center. In fact, women have 
no unified political ideology and no 
comprehensive way of defining their 
interests. Not all women call them-
selves ·feminists, and we can easily 
acknowledge this division. 

But 
accepting the idea of division and
I ' 
political difference within the ranks of 
feminists 
becomes more 
difficult. 
Definitions of feminism -mean 
different, 
possibly contradictory, 
things. When one woman's feminism 
undermines the validity of another 
woman's, the larger whole of the 
movement begins to lose meaning. 

The questions facing the Women's 
Center-and any organization which 
calls 
itself simply "women's"- go 
beyond the incessant questioning of 
whose feminism counts as real. For at 
some point the women's movement has 
to reconcile its relationship to an 
incredibly diverse body of women. Is 
the movement obligated to include all 
the views of women merely because 
they are held by women? Or is the 
primary commitment not to some 
inclusive 
representation but to a 
specific political agenda, a specific 
feminism? 

The Women's Center dealt with 
these questions when it reevaluated its 
statement of purpose. That statement 
grew out of the realization that the 
Women's Center had run- up against 
rbe wall of its own homogeneity. In 
restructuring the Center with the·hope 
that it would become a "place for all

graphy, or the ERA, 
but not on abortion. 
women," the women recognized the 
strength feminism gathers from a 
multiplicity of class, cultural, and 
racial experiences. Did they turn away 
from this recognition in excluding 
Students for Life? 
I soon realized that my first answer 
to this question, a simple "yes," proved 
too easy and ignored many d imensions 
of the decision. There was much more 
at stake in this instance than an 
opportunity to enhance the Center's 
diversity. Incorporating these women 
could undermine the Center's political 
orientation and its ability to work for 
certain political beliefs. In denying 
entry to Students for Life, the Center 
affirmed a specific political agenda 
which they d id not want compromised. 
In effect, they rejected the obligation to 
represent all women when some of 
them held views in basic contradiction 
to the Center's commitment to 
feminism. 

For every belief there exists · an 
opposing belief. If I choose to fight on 
one side, I must consider the other 
side, attempt to understand it, and 
even respect it as an alternative. But I 
still remain committed to fighting 
against 
it. There is a 
precarious 
balance to fmd between accommodation 
and focused pursuit. Too often society 
has expected women's political efforts 
to strike that balance on the side of 
accommodation . 

I respect the women of the Center 
for claim ing their political nature 
outright, and even more, for claiming 
~e right to fight for their political 
mterests. T hese interests, no longer 
synonymous at Yale with the word 
"feminism," have found opposition in 
Students for Life. The women of this 
group vehemently insist that they are 
feminists; 
they deny an y ties to 
national pro-life groups, except one 
entitled Feminists for Life. As an 
organization, they do not claim that 
abortion 
should be illegal. Their 
objectives include exploring 
the 
morality of abortion, exposing the 
potential harms which accompany the 
procedure, a nd 
advocating fu ll 
consideration of the alternatives. 

But as individuals, their objectives 
differ from the organization's rhetoric. 
When questioned, members of Stu-
dents for Life express the belief that 
abortion should be illegal except in 
rare cases. G iven their strong personal 
views, I question their honesty in 
refusing to take an offical stand on the 
legality issue. More important, I lose 
respect for them as a women's group 
because they fail to back up their 
personal views with 
a 
political 
statement. 

In the case of abortion, women 
cannot separate the personal from the 
political. Ultimately, these women 
threaten my right to abortion, and that 
threat touches a raw emotional chord 
within me concerning right and 
wrong. Every struggle for human 
rights begins with this instinct for what 
a human being deserves. I must reject 
the intellectual arguments of these 
women because of the same instinct 
which 
supports my pro-choice 
beliefs- the feeling that each human 
being has the fundamental right to 
control her own body. 

In the end, women at Yale lost 
control of their own Center, as Dean 
Sidney Altman decided that 
all 
women's groups, specificaJiy Students 
for Life, must have a place there. 
Altman's command made the women's 
attempts to work out their own 
arrangement seem beside the point. 
But quite the opposite is true. The 
conflict at Yale represents important 
changes 
m 
the broader women's 
movement. "Feminism" no longer 
connotes a single political ideology, 
and women's groups cannot assume a 
common purpose with aJI who call 
themselves feminist. One sign of the 
movement's development is this new 
level of political dissension within its 
ranks. Women must go beyond old 
definitions of feminism to identify 
political ideas which promote their best 
interests.

"In modern times we 
usually don't have ex-
temal lions. All of our 
lions are inside of us 
now." 
8 The New Journal/ December 4. 1987 
In Yale's stacks, the wntmg on the 
tables and walls, scribbled in black pen 
and colored markers, speaks of love 
and trouble. "I don't belong here, I am 
too stupid! My professors all hate me!" 
someone has written on one desktop. 
On another: "All I want to do is sleep 
for a few weeks, like my dog at home. 
Is that too much to ask? I won't pee on 
the rug." Basic questions appear: "Why 
me?" and "Is love a media myth?" 
There is also an offering of advice. 
"Music can keep you sane," someone 
writes. "If you screw up on one test or 
paper or even in one whole class your 
life will be far from over." But the graf-
fiti has a limited effect. "I can't keep on 
like this. I have to do something 
NOW," one tabletop reads. "This can 
be a very bad place. Here I am in the 
stacks, last week of school, and- some-
one- a guy- breaks into 
muffled 
sobs two aisles down." 

Humor, advice, longing, and des-
pair surface in a variety of graffiti, but 
they often come from the same source, 
stress. Stress has an effect on both 
physical and emotional well-being, and 
in recent years has received increasing 
attention from the medical field for its 
link to physical illness. In a meeting of 
mind and body, stress management 
formalizes ways to prevent "stressing 
out," a condition with symptoms as 
mild as cold hands and as threatening 
as chest pain. 

The coronary heart disease that such 
pain can signal has become the major 
cause of premature death in the United 
States. The medical establishment has 
responded to this high incidence with 
an increased interest in stress manage-


In modern times we usually don't 
have external lions. All of our lions are 
inside of us now, and we push our but-
tons mentally in response to threats to 
our ego or threats to things that we 
value, but that triggers the same bodily 
response," Roderick Watts, a stress 
management counselor and psycholo-
gist, explains. Dr. Watts, on the 
Medical School faculty, coordinates 
the adult programs at the Consultation 
Center, a clinic near the Yale campus 
that serves the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center, the Department of 
Psychiatry of the School of Medicine, 
and 
Community Consultation 
Board, 
Inc. 
He addresses 
stress 
management in a number of work-
shops 
for business and nonprofit 
groups and teaches its techniques to 
the Yale community during midterms 
and finals. 

From outside Watts' office, 
children's voices fade in and· out, 
signaling activity in the Center's 
special programs. "We are prevention-
oriented in general- anything like 
consultation, education, and training 
designed to prevent mental health pro-
blems before they occur," Watts says. 
For worried students as well as cor-
porate bosses, stress management fits 
within this model and often results in 
lowered health care costs. 

Students attend Watts' seminars 
because they have difficulty coping 
with academic and personal pressure. 
Joa~ Slepian (SOM '93), familiar with 
these problems, has d1scovered how 
stress management addresses students' 
needs. She spent six years as director 
of counseling services for Hartwick 
College 
in 
upstate 
New 
York 
and found stress management an im-
portant part of her work. A trained 
clinician with master's degrees in 
counseling and clinical social work, she 
came- to Hartwick without any formal 
training in stress management. Upon 
witnessing inappropriate student 
responses to stress, such as heavy 
drinking, she recognized the need for a 
healthful alternative. 

"Once you identify the stressor and 
the situation and what is going on you 
can do one of three things. You can 
change yourself, you can change the 
situation, or you can change your

Corrao uses biofeedback for her patients in the TMJ Facial Pain Clinic at 
the Yale Psychophysiology Center, 
where she serves as clinical coordinator. TMJ stands for temporoman-
dibular joint disorders, which are problems that affect the joint between the 
temple bone and lower jaw. The TMJ 
Facial Pain Clinic treats patients with 
discomfort due to congenital problems, 
an injury such as a car accident, or 
chronic trauma from clenching or grinding 
the teeth, a habit linked to anxiety. To modify behavior, a biofeedback 
machine depicts involuntary responses 
through visual or aural representation. 
For example, patients can learn to increase blood flow to their hands by invoking images of warmth and gauging 
their progress with the biofeedback 
machine. Corrao uses biofeedback for 
measuring jaw muscle tension; the 
technique has proved successful also in 
treating migraines. 

Studies on the medical effectiveness 
of biofeedback and relaxation response 
reveal clear benefits for those in the 
fourth stage of stress development. 
School of Medicine Professor Linda 
Powell has co-authored the most recent

Dangerous Decisions 
Jennifer Sachs 
Over winter break, workers will install 
two coin-operated condom dispensers 
in each of Yale's residential colleges. 
These dispensers, filled with brand 
name, medicated latex condoms, will 
be located in the single-sex bathrooms 
next to the dining halls. Though 
students might prefer to have them 
nearer to their bedrooms, the ma-
chines will at least be closer than Store 
24, or WaWa's, or the pharmacy at 
University H ealth Services (UHS). By 
installing the condom dispensers, Yale 
will be publicly committing itself to 


certain assumptions about its un-
dergraduate population: 
that 
Yale 
students are sexually active, and that a 
percentage may already carry the virus 
that can cause AIDS. 

The proposal to install the dis-
pensers originated in July and gained 
acceptance only last month- the lag 
due partly to summer inertia, but 
mostly to bureaucratic tie-ups. Yale 
College Dean Sidney Altman said in 
early November that he was "not 
aware" of the particulars of discussions 
regarding the dispensers and that the 
decision to install them rested in the 
hands of the Council of Masters. The 
chair of that group, Berkeley Master 
Robin Winks, refers specific inquiries 
to Dr. Daniel Rowe, Director of Uni-
versity H ealth. Rowe says he has had 
the dispensers ready to go for some 
time, but needed approval from the 
Dean's office. 

This delay points to a peculiar pro-
blem in the care and treatment of 
AIDS. The disease affects so many 
facets of society that it has blurred the 
boundaries of responsibility: health 
care providers now act as judges of se-X-
ual practices, and public officials daily 
confront issues of medical ethics. 

Defining a response to AIDS that bal-
ances these separate concerns can tax 
the resources and imagination of an y 
instit1,1tion. A confused or halfhearted 
response, however, could be fatal to 
the students, the financial health, and 
the vitality of Yale. 

Last April the University hired Sally 
Rinaldi, a registered nurse with a 
master's degree in public health, as its 
AIDS educator. Rinaldi came from 
Yale-New Haven H ospital, where she 
had served in a similar capacity. She 
works at UHS three days a week, com-
.piling AIDS information and answer-
ing 
telephone queries about 
the 
disease. She also helps to coordinate 
the AIDS education program of guest 
speakers, information for freshman 
counselors, and pamphlets. The pro-
gram tries to encourage students to 
practict' "safer sex," defined as sexual 
activity in which partners do not ex-
change fluids- such 
as semen or 
saliva-which 
might transmit the 
AIDS virus. 

R owe, whose cheerful optimism has 
endeared him to his staff, seems en-
thusiastic about his new employee. 
H er presence here, he feels, means that 
"Yale has made a real commitment to 
AIDS education." Cathe·rine Teare 
(ES '88), who works as Rinaldi's assis-
tant, disagrees. "She can't do an ex-
cellent job in a half-time position. And 
she's hamstrung by the administration, 
who won't allow anything too explicit 
to be put out." The pamphlets dis-
tributed at UHS show couples in dis-
creetly sexual poses: arms caressing 
shoulders, hands on backs. Posters on 
the ground floor of the Health Services 
building, of a green blob carrying a 
gun or a spear. above the warning 
"AIDS KILLS," do not conjure up 
thoughts of sex, responsible or other-
wise. 

"A lot of the girls we're 
messing around with 
we've been messing 
around with since 
freshman year." 

Rinaldi's main accomplishment at 
Yale has been to encourage the forma-
tion of student groups to educate their 
peers. She assisted the organizers of 
the AIDS Task Force at Yale (AT-
FAY), of which Teare is a member, in 
planning AIDS Education and P reven-
tion Week in November. Rinaldi also 
works with about a dozen students, 
many from ATF A Y, who will parti-
cipate in monthly educational forums 
and presentations on the disease. Ad-
ministrators feel that the most effective 
dissemination of information about 
AIDS occurs when students hear it 
from their peers. ATFAY has at-
tempted to reach the undergraduate 
heterosexual 
population with con-
troversial table tents that tell the story 
of a monogamous couple's discovery, 
right before graduation, that both part-
ners carry the virus. These efforts, like 
Rinaldi's, falter, 
because would-be 
educators often do not know what spe-
cific knowledge gaps exist or how to 
address them. "It has to be discussed 
among students," Teare says. "But I 
don't know how it can be done. For all 
I know, everyone knows all about 
AIDS and practicing safe sex- but I 
d oubt it." 

Other schools have begun to ex-
amine the level of awareness about 
AIDS on their campuses, and the sta-
tistics have not been encouraging. An 
article in the February Chronicle of 
Higher Education reported that 74 per-
cent of 13,000 students surveyed at 
Stanford did 
not discuss sexually 
transmitted diseases with their part-
ners, and more than a quarter did not 
know what constituted "safe sex·." An 
u nofficial survey conducted on 2000 
students at Brown University last 
spring revealed that only 24 percent 
had changed 
their sexual 
habits 
because of knowledge about AIDS. 
And a 
University of Connecticut 
psychology professor recently released 
the results of a questionnaire which 
showed that 70 percent of the students 
he interviewed practiced what he term-
ed "unsafe sex." 

H ow does Yale compare? The 'Uni-
versity has not undertaken any com-
prehensive studies to gauge either the 
extent of sexual activity or the effects of 
AIDS awareness on students here. 
Although Altman, Rinaldi, and other 
health officials all voice concern that 
many Ya.le students ignore the dangers 
of AIDS, none has specific information 
to support these fears. Rather, they 
base them on assumptions about the 
nature of being a college student: "I 
remember being one myself," Altman 
says. "There's a tendency to think that 
you're immortal."

Dr. Daniel Rowe, director of University Health Services: He proposed the condom 
machines to protect "my population." 

Conversations and interviews with 
undergraduate men' and ""omen sug-
gest that they are neither as cautious as 
Altman would like them to be, nor as 
ignorant as Teare s~spects they are. 
On this campus, the level of awareness 
about the medical aspects of the 
disease- facts and fallacies about 
transmission and the types of behavior 
that contribute to risk- appears fairly 
high. Most of the approximately 30 
respondents to an unscientific survey 
of 300 undergraduates indicated that 
they knew AIDS could not be trans-
mitted easily: "not by casual contact, 
shared razors; in general, very difficult 
to transmit. ... " 

Knowledge does not always cor-
relate with attitudes, though, and 
many Yale undergraduates seem to 
share a comfortable feeling of isolation 
and insularity from the disease. Almost 
all students responding to the surve), 
except those who said they were vir-
gins, acknowledged some measure of 
personal danger. when asked directly if 
they were at risk. But answers to a 
more general question, "Who is at 
risk? " did not always include the 
respondent. "Mostly homosexuals and 
H aitians and people from Zaire," one 
replied. 
Another an-
swered, 
"prostitutes 
and 
their 
'customers,' men who've had homo-
18 The New Journal/December 4, 1987 
sexual intercourse, IV drug users, peo~ 
ple from Haiti, Zaire, and a few other 
countries." 

Even when speaking directly about 
AIDS at Yale, students can avoid con-
fronting its relevance to them. J ohn 
Rozen says that he thinks about AIDS 
fairly often, and he knows that the 
disease has affected many different 
groups: "Male homosexuals, IV drug 
users, and women who sleep with a lot 
of guys." He doesn't think that A IDS 
poses a particular threat to "his circle," 
especially since most of his friends-are 
not gay. They sleep with. numerous 
women, usually use condoms, and do 
not discuss the possibility of disease 
before or after sexual activity. "Discus-
sion breaks up the continuity of sex," 
he says, smiling. 

As evidence of his own 
invul-
nerability, Rozen cites recent studies 
indicating that male-to-female 
transmission of the AIDS virus is more 
likely than female-to-male transmis-
sion. Fraternity brothers Tom Blake 
and William Klein, however, now 
treat women as calculated risks. They 
have cut down on their "roadtripping," 
using condoms when they do but pre-
ferring to date women whose sexual 
histories they can determine. "There's 
more incentive to be with someone you 
know," Blake says. He and Klein have 
PERSPECTIVES 
an "AIDS index," a one-to-ten scale by 
which they rate the likelihood of infec-
tion of their women friends. 

Michael Lindgren, an outgoing he-
terosexual man who rarely uses con-
doms because they are "a pain in the 
ass," agrees that some degree of 
knowledge about a partner's sexual 
history is helpful. The college com-
munity is so small, he adds, that "a lot 
of the girls we're messing around with 
we've been messing around with since 
freshman year," and he knows which of 
his friends have slept with which 
women. "That's what's nice about 
Yale," he says. 

Rationales like this nearly bring Dr. 
Robert DeBernardo out of his seat. 
The clinical immunologist, who heads 
the AIDS policy' committee at UHS 
and serves as the Medical Coordinator 
for AIDS, responded to this outlook in 
a November 6 editorial to the Yale 
Daily News. In it, he wrote that "No 
matter how careful one may be, after 
enough different partners you will en-
counter an infected partner .· ... If 
one out of every thousand airplane 
flights 
crashed, 
would you 
fly?." 

DeBernardo also disputes the conten-
tion that condom use alone can protect 
against AIDS. Ht> says that infection is 
"strictly a statistical sort of thing. Cer-
tainly the rate of transmission is not 
100 percent. And certainly it's not 
zero. You can take your choice in be-
tween." Although opinions on the ef-
ficacy of condoms vary, studies that 
show them to have a 30 percent failure 
rate in preventing gonorrhea seem to 
indicate that they are not failsafe. 

DeBernardo warns that, while people 
should use condoms, he does not ad-
vocate "using them and forgetting 
everything else." The ideal option, he 
says, is a monogamous relationship in 
which both partners know they do not 
carry the virus. 

Heterosexual women may need to 
follow his advice more closely than 
their male partners. Female suscep-
tibility to AIDS has received national 
media attention, especially with there-
cent news that women tend to die more 
quickly of the disease. During AIDS 
Education and Prevention Week, a

talk on Women and AIDS was one of the 
best attended events, attracting a 
crowd of over 30 women and two or 
three men. Chris Norwood, the fea-
tured speaker, noted that heterosexual 
women show an infection rate three 
times that of other groups, including 
intravenous drug users. Perhaps as a 
result of the barrage of publicity, some 
women express almost irrational fears 
of infection. Sarah Crocker has had 
only two sexual relationships in the 
past three years, one of these long-term 
and monogamous. In the other,- her 
boyfriend and she were so careful that

jokes. Yet she still fears infection so 
much that she has considered getting 
tested for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIY), the virus which can cause 
AID S. 

C rocker admits that her fear might 
seem like paranoia, and probably is ex-
cessive. She blames a society that puts 
most of the onus for sexual respon-
sibility on its women. "Women have 
always internalized a responsibility for 
sex that men haven't. It's less affrontive 
to their consciousness to have to think 
about sex," she says. Since the news 
that condoms provide a degree of pro-
!ection against AIDS, advertising has 
Increased dramatically, nearly all of it 
directed at women. Rebecca Patter-
son, a single senior woman, says she 
has considered purchasing a supply of 
condoms to keep in her room. If a 
sexual situation arose and neither she 
nor her partner were prepared, she 
says, "I can certainly see where I would 
be- I don't know if lazy is the right 
word -lax enough not to actually use a 
condom." She blushes. "But buying 
condoms would be pathetic, consider-
ing I'm not sexually active at the mo-
ment." According to recent market 
surveys, women have begun to pur-
chase condoms in much larger num-
bers than they did before the AIDS 
epidemic. 

PERSPECTIVES 
H IV postt1vtty, he does not think he 
has AIDS. 

Schleicher's relaxed attitude finds its 
opposite in one who, like Crocker, ap-
parently has little to fear. Neil Orne 
has had one relationship since he came 
out at the end of his sophomore year, 
with a man who had practiced safer sex 
with his former partners. Still, he was 
so terrified at the prospect of AIDS 
that he convinced his boyfriend to get 
tested. "We talked about it a lot. I was 
very scared ... unreasonably so," he 
now admits. The test was negative, but 
Orne still considers taking one himself. 
"Someday I may get tested just to have 
a 
piece of paper 
that says I'm 
negative." 

He and Klein have an 
"AIDS index" by 
which they rate the 
likelihood of infection 
of their women friep.ds 
For male 
homosexuals, 
once 
thought to be somehow more suscepti-
ble to the disease, attitudes and prac-
tices began changing years ago. Adam 
Stone, .a gay junior, says that "every 
person that I've slept with at Yale has 
practiced 
safe sex. 
It was never 
brought up, it just happened." Stone, 
whose room is decorated with .UHS 
safe sex pamphlets, has had six or 
seven partners since he came to Yale; 
he does not have anal sex, would not 
perform fellatio, and avoids deep kiss-
ing. H e also does not sleep with 
women, although other gay men here 
do. 

Scott Schleicher was "actively

the virus, a number at which DeBernardo laughs. The doctor is slower to 
dismiss the words of Michael Chapian, 
the coordinator of ATFAY, who alleges that eight undergraduate and 
graduate students have had 10 leave 
Yale suffering from AIDS, ARC, or 
the stress of HIV positivity, and that 
approximately one dozen students admitted to Yale as freshmen this past 
September knew before entering that 
they were HIV positive. He admits 
that Chapian may have access to information which UHS does not share. 
Rowe denies that Chapian could 
know whether incoming freshmen had 
tested positive for HIV. "The health 
history report that the freshmen get 
does not include any HIV information," he says. Chapian says that he 
learned about the 12 HIV positives 
from a contact at the medical school, 
and that he personally knows "more 
than two" undergraduates who tested 
positive at sites other than UHS. 
Regardless of the number of known 
positives, DeBernardo says that "Those 
who are known HIV positive are only 
the tip of the iceberg." Some students 
may be unwitting carriers. 
Those cases 
that 
UHS 
administrators and providers do know 
about, they treat according to the 
guidelines of the 
University AIDS 
policy. Asymptomatic HIV positives 
will have full access to all University 
activities and facilities, while people 
suffering from AIDS or ARC will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A 
cautionary note precedes these guidelines: "The following policies are based 
on 
the 
current state of medical 
knowledge, which is subject to change 
as new 
information becomes 
available." 
The Health Care plan currently 
covers AIDS treatment, which DeBernardo estimates can run as high as 
$70,000 per year for each patient. If 
UHS is faced with a sudden increase in 
the number of cases covered by its insurance plan, he says, "it's going to be 
a financial burden." Some of this cost 
will be assumed by students, through 
small increases in their Yale medical 
insurance. Rowe says that, for now, 
UHS will rely on its own "stop-loss" insurance, which picks up the costs of 
catastrophic illness for health maintenance organizations after a certain 
point, to prevent students from feeling 
the pinch. Stop-loss insurance is now 
inexpensive, but DeBernardo believes 
it may soon skyrocket in response to 
greater demand. An administrator at 
Yale-New Haven adds that hospitals 
which have attempted to provide insured treatment for AIDS patients 
have begun to go bankrupt. "Work 
that out for yourself," he says. "If the 
Health Plan had to foot the bill for a 
number of patients, it would be difficult to imagine how they would remain solvent, unless the University 
subsidized them." Neither DeBernardo 
nor Rowe can predict what UHS will

do then, although they both insist that 
Health Services will continue to provide coverage for AIDS treatment. 
DeBernardo's characteristic brevity 
dissolves when he discusses the Health 
Services' need to keep all options open 
in dealing with AIDS. He plans to 
recommend reevaluation of the UHS 
policy on a yearly or semi-yearly basis, 
noting that more anonymous testing 
may eventually prove desirable. Then 
again, he says, a time may come when 
HIV positivity does not bear the 
stigma, or create the fear, that it does 
now. "Maybe we can get more civilized 
and the information can just go in the 
regular medical record," he says. 
Providers are to treat 
all patients as if they 
are infected. 
For now, other Yale administrators 
concentrate on short-term responses to 
AIDS while slowly building a permanent apparatus to deal with larger problems in the future. University officials 
obviously fear 
the changing 
dimensions of the disease will throw 
their 
most 
careful 
planning off 
balance, so they wait and evaluate 
every step. They seem to hope that 
they will be spared a sudden spurt of 
cases until they are ready to handle 
them financially, legally, and emotionally. Yale chose to lease the condom machines for one year instead of 
the two years suggested by the vendors 
"to see how they would work out," 
Rowe says. But while the University 
hesitates and examines its options, the 
threat of AIDS continues to grow.

It is Richard's first visit to the Dana-3 
clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital, 
and he has brought his wife and their 
18-month-old baby with him. They sit 
quietly in one of the many examining 
rooms that line the hallway of Dana-3, 
where twice a week the hospital's AIDS 
Care team gathers to meet and evaluate some of the 300 patients they currently treat. Dr. Warren Andiman, 
chief physician at the AIDS Care 
Clinic, has not met Richard before. He 
is a new patient, but Dr. Andiman 
knows the story of Richard and his 
family long before he enters the room. 
Their file tells a story he has seen many 
times. 
A New Haven man in his late twenties, Richard had used drugs since the 
age of 15, mostly heroin and cocaine 
toward the end. Four years ago, Richard got lucky. He enrolled in a 
methadone program to fight his heroin 
abuse, and after two years of treatment 
24 The New Journal/December 4. 1987 
he gave up drugs entirely. He has not 
touched them since. Richard began to 
work regularly, and two-and-a-half 
years ago he married his wife. Soon 
after, they gave birth to a baby boy. 
Last August, when Richard checked 
into a local hospital suffering from extreme weight loss, doctors determined 
that he had a low white blood cell 
count. On the advice of a physician, 
Richard underwent a test for the 
presence of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody in his 
system. The test returned positive. 
Richard was feeling the first symptoms 
of infection with AIDS. 
In September, both his wife and 
child underwent the test for AIDS. 
Both tests came back positive. "All I 
ever expected all the time I was doing 
drugs was hepatitis," Richard tells Dr. 
Andiman. "I didn't even know about 
AIDS. I thought my whole life was 
turning around, doctor." 
None of the family suffers from the 
many opportunistic infections which 
attack a body whose immune system 
has been weakened by the AIDS virus. 
For the time being, they will live normal lives. All Richard can do now is to 
request psychiatric care for the trauma 
the family will face and for the tremendous guilt he feels at having infected 
his wife, who has never touched drugs 
or alcohol, and his child. 
Richard and his family reflect a 
tragic set of circumstances that is 
becoming more prevalent as the AIDS 
epidemic grows in the United States. 
Intravenous drug (IVD) abuse has 
become a major source for the spread 
of the AIDS virus. With it come problems which are unlike those encountered by any other risk group. In 
cities like New Haven-urban centers 
with poor, minority populations- a 
new picture of the AIDS epidemic is 
emerging. Intravenous drug abuse

now accounts for only 17 percent of 
AIDS cases nationally. But in New 
H aven well over 60 percent of all 
AIDS cases are intravenous dru& 
abusers, the sexual partners of IVD 
abusers, or the children of an IVD 
abusing parent. 

AIDS has brought an added dimen-
sion of danger and fear to an already 
horrible probl~m. IVD abusers have 
always faced a debilitating addiction; 
but before AIDS, they at worst risked 
catching hepatitis from sharing a nee-
dle. Physical addiction, isolation, and 
financial destitution still lead addicts to 
use dirty "works." Now, however, 
AIDS threatens to infect and kill 
thousands of IVD abusers, their sexual 
partners, and their children. 

Homosexual and bisexual men still 
account for two-thirds of the 57,000 
AIDS cases nationwide, but many gay 
men have responded by practicing safe 
sex and reducing promiscuity. In cities 
like San Francisco, the gay population 
is primarily white, middle class, and 
literate. AIDS information reaches the 
homosexual community through stan-
dard educational channels. Those who 
wish to reduce risk of contact with the 
disease can change their sexual habits 
In comparison, IVD abusers must 
survive in an isolated world. While 
homosexuals can fight the disease as a 
community, no community of IVD 
abusers exists, other than in "shooting 
galleries" where addicts gather to pur-
chase and shoot heroin and co-
caine- where the chance of exposure 
to HIV from contaminated needles 
runs highest. Heroin users do not 
discriminate when desperate for the 
drug that they need. Unlike unsafe 
sexual practices, hero;n abuse is addic-
tive and almost impossible to beat 
alone. 
"It's 
total 
madness," said 
Malcolm, a 35-year-old reformed IVD 
addict. "A lot of people are thrown in 
and there's no getting out alone. I've 
never seen anyone pull themselves 
out." 

Often homeless or indigent, New 
Haven's almost 10,000 IVD abusers 
·are vulnerable like no other risk group. 
According to officials at the Connec-
ticut State H ealth Department, only 
1,060 of those IVD abusers are known 
to be undergoing any form of drug 
abuse treatment. Even those who wish 
to enter a program often cannot. A 
three to four month waiting list forces 
addicts seeking treatment to continue 
to deal with their addiction alone. 
AIDS has made those three or four 
months a time in which they could 
easily contract a disease which no 
clinical treatment can cure. 

Geraldine Bryant can speak con-
fidently 
about the 
IVD-abusing 
population. As director of the Orchard 
Street Methadone Clinic and a mem-
ber of the Mayor's Task Force on 
AIDS, she has become an outspoken 
activist for AIDS education in New 
Haven. Her clinic, one of three 
methadone units run by the APT 
foundation. a nonprofit organization 
By 1992 Connecticut 
can expect a death 
rate of five to ten 
people a day from 
AIDS. 
for the treatment of substance abuse, 
administers methadone to some 280 
reforming IVD abusers. A synthetic 
narcotic, methadone is itself an addic-
tive drug which alleviates withdrawal 
symptoms and stops craving without 
giving a "high." 

For Bryant and her staff, dealing 
with intravenous drug abuse is a trying 
job in its own right. AIDS has brought 
new dimensions to their work. "The 
true stress comes from seeing someone 
whose life is debilitated by drugs. but 
who comes in for treatment," Bryant 
said. "They begin to turn around their 
world. A mother with children begins 
'to be concerned about their welfare, 
health, and appearance. She gets a job, 
and then she comes in and tells us she 
has AIDS." Approximately 25 percent 
of APT's methadone patients who have 


consented to be tested are HIV posi-
tive. That statistic, spread out over the 
other 8,800 IVD abusers in New 
Haven who have never entered treat-
ment, suggests that up to 2,200 IVD 
abusers are now out there, out of touch 
and unaware that they carry the AIDS 
virus. 

"There are people who are out there 
using, who may not have contracted 
[AIDS] but will if they continue to stay 
out there," Bryant said. "They will 
share needles and works if they .are 
desperate or ill. They are not con-
cerned about catching a disease at that 
point in their life. They will catch it 
and spread it because they cannot get 
into treatment." 

The waiting list for methadone 
treatment and the IVD abusers who 
are now known to be H IV positive 
only partially indicate the seriousness 
of New H aven's AIDS crisis. New 
Haven currently has 119 cases of 
diagnosed full-blown AIDS, the stage 
of the disease in which opportunistic 
infections attack the body. H owever, a 
report issued recently by the Mayor's 
Task Force on AIDS estimates that 
about 6,000 people in New Haven are 
now HIV positive. By 1991 New Ha-
ven can expect 700 to 800 cases of full-
blown AIDS, many more cases of 
ARC (AIDS-related complex), and 
thousands who are HIV positive. Most 
of the individuals who will come down 
with full-blown AIDS by 1991 are al-
ready infected. It is too late to save 
them. 

New Haven now faces two major 
problems. First, it must prepare. the 
city and its health care programs for 
the wave of dying young people which 
will flood the city's hospitals in the 
years to come. By 1992 Connecticut 
can expect a death rate of five to ten 
people a day from AIDS. Second, New 
Haven must begin to work toward sav-
ing the thousands of others, mostly 
poor minorities associated with IVD 
abuse, who risk infection. City workers 
and volunteers have only begun to ad-
dress these problems. 

Bryant believes that to prevent addicts 
from becoming infected, outreach wor-
kers must teach them to use drugs safe-
ly. Though some cities considered 
distributing free needles, fear of pro-
moting IVD abuse ruled out that op-
tion. The alternative in New Haven 
and elsewhere is to teach IVD addicts 
to sterilize their needles and to supply 
them with the necessary materials-
bleach or alcohol packets. At the same 
time, outreach workers distribute con-
doms and discuss safer sex practices to 
protect the partners of IVD abusers. 

Educators can reach potential AIDS 
vJcttms 
only 
by 
penetrating 
the 
neighborhoods, schools, soup kitchens, 
and welfare motels. But once inside, 
outreach workers still face the barrier 
of an "unbelieving" community. Accor-
ding to Bryant, IVD abusers often 
think that they are immortal. "No mat-
ter how much you warn them, they 
believe AIDS is a distant, far-off threat 
and that it could never happen to 
them." 

she said. "Intravenous drug 
users have experienced so much that is 
terrible .in life and have survived. 
They are convinced that their luck is 
going to hold out. We know this is not 
true." Even if successful, outreach 
education will begin to show effects on-
ly three to seven years after full-scale 
programs are implemented, according 
to the Mayor's Task Force report. 

Much time and many lives will pass 
before New Haven can begin counting 
off those years. Outreach education re-
mains far from adequate. 

Only this October the city govern-
ment dedicated three full-time workers 
from the city Health Department to 
AIDS outreach. 
They will 
enter 
neighborhoods and communities cut 
off from AIDS education to work with 
IVD abusers, referring them to drug 
treatment centers. The city initiated 
the program at the recommendation of 
the Mayor's Task Force on AIDS, 
which Mayor Biagio DiLieto created 

last year to coordinate AIDS services 
in New Haven. 

"We're no strangers to any of this," 
said Dominick Maldonado. "These are 
our own communities." Maldonado 
worked for eight years at Crossroads, a 
45-bed residential facility for the treat· 
ment of IVD addicts in New H aven, 
before becoming one of the city's 
outreach workers. The move from 
Crossroads to the streets will not be dif-
ficult for him. He grew up in New 
Haven, and knows the streets well. He 
has seen friends become IVD addicts, 
and he has seen friends die from 
AIDS. Yet Maldonado remains op· 
timistic about the IVD community. 

"The majority of addicts do want to 
change," he said. "But you cannot tell 
them to stop using until they are ready 
themselves. All you can do in the 
meantime is make the connection be· 
tween drugs and AIDS, and teach 
them to use [drugs] safely if they're go-
ing to use at all." Despite his optimism, 
Maldonado admits that three outreach 
workers cannot educate thousands .of 
addicts. 

Fortunately, they are not a.lone. 
Long before the city government 
began to take action, a few privately 
run community groups like AIDS Pro-
ject New Haven (APNH) carried the 
burden of outreach. APNH began in 
1983, soon after the first AIDS cases in 
New Haven were diagnosed. Those 
patients were mostly gay, and APNH 
began as a resource for New Haven's 
gay population, providing an AIDS 
hotline, referral, counseling, and sup· 
port services. These services have ex-
panded. But as the majority of AIDS 
patients in New Haven shifted from 
homosexuals to IVD abusers, APNH 
found itself revising its tactics to ac-
commodate a population with many dif-
ferent social problems. Working out of 
a one-room office at College and Elm 
streets, APNH now deals principally 
With IVD users and their sexual part· 
ners. Where posters, pamphlets, pub-
lic forums, and talks once sufficed for 
risk education, APNH outreach 
Workers must now pound the streets, 
P&ssing out condoms and bleach, 
COunseling, an'd making referrals to 
drug treatment centers. 

"To have an impact you can't have a 
distanced approach," said George Ap-
pleby, chairman of the board of 
APNH. Appleby is a member of both 
the Mayors and Governors Task Forces 
on A IDS, and sits on the faculty of the 
Graduate School of Social Work at 
Southern Connecticut University. He 
became involved in AIDS work in 
1984, soon after his best friend died of 
the disease. "You need immediate per· 
sonal contact. Eighty-five percent of 
the IVD users out there are unknowns 
who haven't come in for treatment, 
and they don't wear signs." 

APNH now has over 150 part-time 
"By being an AIDS 
worker you share the 
pariah status of the 
people you work 
.th " 
volunteers staffing their various 
counseling and support services, but 
only six part-time outreach workers. 
Appleby realizes the desperate need for 
more workers, but volunteers commit· 
ted to street work are hard to find. The 
work is difficult and intimidating. 

Many APNH volunteers burn out 
from too much time and stress in the 
field. 

"When your volunteers are 
primarily white, middle-class people 
trying to relate to poor blacks and 
Hispanics, it can be difficult building 
up a system of trust," Appleby said. 
"Working the streets is not something 
we feel comfortable with, but it has to 
be done. We're concerned with getting 
to all the populations we need to." 

These concerns have led workers to the 
shooting galleries themselves, where 
drug suppliers allow workers to enter 
safely and pass out alcohol or bleach 
for cleaning works. "It protects their 
clientele, as strange as that sounds," 
Appleby said. Workers must contend 
with other barriers, such as addicts' 
distrust of outside assistance arising 
from fear of the narcotic officers who

met with resistance from 
th~ state 
when they tried to put AIDS posters on 
buses. "DON'T PASS THE SPIKE-
USE CONDOMS," the ad reads. Ac-
cording to Appleby, APNH fought 
with 
the State Commissioner of 
Transportation and the State Depart-
ment of Health for six months before 
going to the Qivil Liberties Union with 
their case. "It was because the ads 
would be offensive. The word 'con-
dom' was a red flag," Appleby said. 
The state eventually gave in.

outreach workers appear as outsiders 
to the city's IVD-abusing population, 
who are mostly black and Hispanic. 
To ·fight AIDS in minority com-
munities, outreach requires initiative 
from within those populations. While 
the city's Hispanic community has 
organized itself to combat AIDS, 
Bryant is frustrated with the slow pace 
of action being taken by black com-
munity leaders. New Haven's black 
population accounts for almost 60 per-
cent of the city's AIDS cases, but re-
mains cut off from educational cam· 
paigns. Bryant would like to see black 
civic leaders who have access to those 
communities take the responsibility for 
educating them. "Black ministers, city 
and community leaders have got to 
stop turning their heads because they 
think it is not a problem for them. It is, 
and we cannot continue to ignore it." 
Bryant said that the Hispanic com· 
munity in New Haven has risen to the 
needs of its population, who require 
bilingual education, information, and 
counseling. 


Hispanos Unidos Contra SIDA 
began last June when 30 members of 
New Haven's Hispanic community 
gathered to discuss the AIDS problem. 
"Everyone made a comm;tment to ' 
work," said Maldonado, a founding 
member of Hispanos Unidos. After 
drafting a work plan in October, 
Hispanos Unidos incorporated their 
board of directors. Since then they 
have created two bilingual pamphlets 
on AIDS prevention-one put to· 
gether by IVD abusers for IVD 
abusers, and one for the general 
public. They have started support 
groups 
for 
patients and 
family 
members and will soon begin to con-
duct outreach work of their own. 
Hispanos Unidos is an exception. 
AIDS activists in New Haven would 
like to see more initiative of this sort, 
but a largely disinterested community 
combines with a lack of funding to 
hamper such efforts. Ironically, while 
APNH focuses on the IVD-abusing 
population, it receives most of its fund-
ing from New Haven's gay population, 
according to Appleby. APNH gets no 
money from the city and received only 
$7,000 total from the state. But it is 
slated to receive another $37,000 from 
the state to hire a full-time director, 
who will spend time applying for 
grants. 
and 
Hispanos 
Unidos 
formed independently and have sur-
vived independently. They owe their 
existence to concerned volunteers ·and 
financial donors. Both groups and the 
Mayor's Task Force would like to :see 
the state government take a 
~ore 
responsible role in fighting AIDS, 
which poses a large threat statewide. 
Connecticut ranks seventh in the na-
tion for incidence of AIDS, and the 
State Department !Jf Health Services 
contends that it is actively moving 
against the disease. Their solution, 
however, is one which New H aven 
AIDS workers believe wastes time and 
money and ultimately hinders their 
own efforts. 

In August the Department of H ealth 
Services contracted with Expand, a 
Maryland-based consulting firm, to 
study the statewide needs for com-
bating the sp':ead of AIDS. In Jan-
uary, Expand will present to the state a 
"conceptual framework paper" with 
suggestions for planning and develop-
ing AIDS education and counseling. 
That paper cost $185,000, and the 
state has agreed to finance whatever 
program Expand suggests - another 
$400,000 to $500,000. 
"I don't think most people in New 
Haven think that's a wise use of 
funds," said Sher . Horosko, coor-
dinator for the Mayor's Task Force on 
AIDS. "Why would you bring in a con-
sulting firm from Maryland to look at 
this 
problem, 
instead of funding 
organizations that are already working 
locally, and struggling? It makes no 
sense to us." The Mayor's Task Force 
advised Mayor DiLieto who, with other 
community leaders, wrote a strong let-
ter of protest to the State Commis-
sioner of Health opposing the project. 
Protestors marched in front of the 
H ealth Department in H artford, but 
the contract was still signed. According 
to Dr. Sheryl Henderson, state coor-
dinator for Expand, the group is still 
assessing Connecticut's AIDS educa-
tion needs and has not yet made any 
specific recommendations. 
Horosko, Appleby, and others 
feared that Expand would attempt to 
set up its own services in New Haven, 
which would split available resources. 
The heads of all three New Haven or-
ganizations met with Henderson last 
month and were assured that no ser-
vice duplications would take place. 
However, Expand's role in fighting 
AIDS statewide and in New Haven re-
mains unclear. "In the meantime, 
we're doing it," Appleby said. "They'll 
go through a period of planning and 
assessment. We've already done that." 
As it is, Connecticut's efforts lag far 
behind those of other states' social, 
medical, and outreach services. New 
Haven already contains over 50 per-
cent of the state's AIDS population, 
and some AIDS workers fear that the 
city could become a magnet, drawing 
AIDS patients from throughout the 
state. San Francisco, because of its

sophisticated AIDS care programs,
became the magnet for California. But
New Haven's services are inadequate
for its own ever-growing AIDS popula-
tion, without confronting an influx of
patients from the rest of Con necticut.
San Franciso developed sophisticated
care programs because the m~ority of
its A IDS population, gay men, has a
strong power base in the city govern-
ment. By comparison, New Haven's
AIDS population has no power base at
all.

The city's IVD abusers must depend
on the efforts of outsiders to combat
the vicious cycle which is slowly con-
suming them. Volunteer groups and
now the city have begun to address the
problem of AIDS and IVD abuse. But
their efforts are dwarfed by the vast
population of minorities and IVD
users whose needs they hope to meet.
The current rift between the state and
New Haven is damaging the cause· of
AIDS education and hurting the AIDS
patients themselves. "My clear impres-
sion is that there is a lack of urgency 6n
the part of state planners," Appleby
said. "The more you delay education
funds, the greater the chance that more
young people are going to be infected
with the virus."

In the meantime people are dying.
Richard and his family are only one
case. The AIDS clinic at Yale-New
Haven hospital has already lost two en-
tire families, 81 people in all. "I think
it's going to get much worse before it
gets better," Bryant said. "Many more
minorities and drug abusers will die
before people begin to pay attention."
Six thousand New Haven residents
may already carry the AIDS virus.
Condoms, bleach, and counseling can
begin to protect the uninfected. But
until outreach receives the support it
needs, the cycles of H IV infection will
continue to turn.

**All Fall Down**
**Author: John Boswell**

Plagues have held a mirror to the
cultures and peoples they affiict for as
long as literature has recorded the fears
and follies of humans. Writings from
Exodus tO Camus' La Peste have
chronicled the reactions of individuals
and nations to biological catastrophe as
a means of exploring human souls and
behavior. This is partly because the
terrifying effects of plague- sickness
and death- are themselves staples of
both history and literature, being the
chief plot devices nature uses in setting
the length and shape of human lives.
They are at once natural and un-
natural, universal and singular, ab-
solutely predictable and totally un-
nerving, and therefore ideal for both
literature and history, which must
decipher the constants of the human
heart by exploring its reactions to par-
ticular and extraordinary events:
Plague adds another dimension to


the revealing power of sickness and
~eath by transforming an essentially
Individual experience into a communal
one. Long ago, the deceased were "laid
to rest" on family land and thought of
as the members of the family or com-
rnunity who had gone before; in the
lllodern world the dead are all gathered
away from the areas used by the living
and hidden away behind cemetery
Walls. The sick are kept away from the
healthy, often in special buildings for
th_is purpose. These distinctions and
their social embodiments are created
by profound anxieties about sickness
and dying, which in the twentieth cen-
tury have taken on the air of the
bizarre and macabre rather than being
thought of as normal events in the lives
of humans. Medicine and its ameliora-
tion of the frailty of the body have con-
tributed to this, but it is also in large
measure the result of loss of faith in
personal or social values beyond good
health and a pleasant life.

Plague demolishes these barriers
and looses on the living and healthy the
anxieties supposed to be contained
beyond hospital and graveyard walls.
Disease and mortality become com-
munal experiences and worries.
Healthy people must think about
disease, must experience sickness other
than their own, must face and cope
with death. An unusual increase in the
number of sick, especially if related to
a communicable illness, can so terrify
the healthy that they cease to believe in
the distinctions which formerly pro-
tected them. Whole societies can begin
to think of themselves as diseased and
dying, even when the majority are not,
because the horror of plague breaks
through the cultural barriers which
had protected the ordinary person
from seeing the inevitable, or so
disorders the natural plot line for in-
d ividuals that notions of "lifetime" col-
lapse.

The most haunting images of plague
in the Western tradition are those of
the Black Death of 1348-1350, which
killed about one-third of the entire
population of Europe in two years .. Its
effects were so devastating that the
political and religious structures of
Europe were profoundly transformed.
Astonishingly, much literature com-
posed at the time takes little notice;
some of it seems utterly oblivious. The
cynical and ribald tales told in the
Decameron by aristocrats who fled the
plague and sealed themselves off from
a dying world are the best known li-
terary legacy of this. The nursery
rhyme "Ring around the rosey" (a
description of one of the symptoms) is
an incongruously light-hearted re-
minder of a later occurrence of the

same plague, and one of the few 
cultural muniments to record the 
magnitude of its horror: "all fall down." 
But the Black Death is by no means 
the most disruptive plague on record. 
Most of the Indian population of South 
America died within 50 years of the ar-
rival of Europeans from the plague of 
smallpox the Spanish brought with 
them. Because the conquistadores were 
accustomed (and more immune) to 
smallpox themselves, because they 
neither understood nor cared about the 
Indians dying by the millions, and-
most poignantly, perhaps-because 
the culture which might have recorded 
the revelations of this plague perished 
along with its creators, nothing sur-
vives to share the secrets of the human 
heart which might have been learned 
from what was perhaps the most de-
vastating single pestile'hce iq history. 
Like other plagues, 
the AIDS 
epidemic is both universal and par-
ticular. In the communities most af-
fected by it so far, one sees the classic 
responses to plague. Some find that the 
walls which protected them from death 
and sickness have collapsed, and they 
regard themselves as members of the 
community of the dying even if they 
are apparently healthy. Others -like 
Boccaccio's storytellers- shore up the 
old walls, build new ones, or escape to 
fantasy. 

But in several ways the AIDS epi-
demic and public reaction to it are un-
paralleled. The walls around disease 
and death have been greatly buttressed 
in the twentieth century not only by 
preoccupation in industrial societies 
with the health of the body but also 
with the concept of being "normal"- a 
concept which has replaced "mor al" or 
"good" in politically based, religiously 
plural societies. In moralistic cultures 
everyone is conscious of being a sin-
ner, a fact ·which mitigates the degree 
of alienation visited upon or felt by 
those who transgress the rules. "Nor-
mality" is a much more alienating con-
cept, since it frequently applies to so-
meone's being rather than to behavior 
which he could alter. Serious illness is 
abnormal in health-obsessed America, 
and few things are as alienating as be-
ing seriously unhealthy. 

This blaming and punishing of vic-
tims for not being "normal" is par-
ticularly devastating in the cases of the 
largest groups of people with AIDS in 
America, gay men and drug addicts. 
Even without fear of contagion, having 
a fatal illness would isolate them from 
American society. When communica-
bility and social stigma are added, the 
rejection, callousness, and indifference 
become overwhelming. It is not too 
difficult to see why, in a society deeply 
troubled by drug abuse on the part of 
political, artistic, and sports elites, the 
public might choose to view heroin ad-
diction as a reprehensible moral choice 
rather than as a pitiful form of suffer-
ing. The circumstances of the poorest 
and most alienated Americans are 
quite different from those of the rich 
and powerful, and one might more 
charitably regard their addiction as a 
desperately wrong choi~e of remedies 
than as a malicious crime, but it is still 
understandable that people entertain 
ambivalence about problems of drug 
abuse. 

It is less easy to understand-
indeed, very hard for me to see-why 
the pathetic, excruciating conse-
quences this often entails are then con-
flated with addicts' bad choices, induc-
ing at best utter indifference to their 
fates and at worst active revulsion and 
hostility. The plight of middle-class 
persons affiicted with lung cancer after 
years of smoking, with heart disease 
after years of being overweight or fail-
ing to exercise, with injuries sustained 
in an automobile accident while intox-
icated, with financial ruin after fiscal 
dishonesty- these prompt compassion 
in most humans, and soften judge-
ments about erstwhile failings. Even if 
we see that in some way their misery is 
related to their previous actions, we 
are reminded that misfortune is as 
common to all of us as are unwise or 
selfish choices. For some reason, the 
unwise choices of poor blacks and His-
panics in America's urban centers 
seem to place them out -of reach of 
compassion or empathy from most 
Americans, including, tragically, the 
government. 

It is as bad for gay men, which is 
more surprising in some ways, because 
they are not usually separated from the 
indifferent majority by emolional, 
social, or physical distance. They come 
from ordinary families of all social 
classes. The wall dividing them from 
the majority is not demarcated by a 
ghetto or a color or economic standing. 
The notion that Western society has 
been characterized by generally in-
creasing progress and tolerance on 
social issues like the position of gay 
people is a misprision. Probably at no 
time and place in Western history have 
attitudes toward gay people been more 
hostile than in the United States and 
Europe throughout most of the twen-
tieth century. This is related to the 
historical vagaries and inconsistencies 
of the transition from moral values to 
pseudo-scientific ones noted above. 

In the ancient world "norms" for 
human beings were largely social and 
behavioral: there was public agree-
ment and expectation about how to be 
a good citizen, a good parent, a good 
child, a good friend, based on codes of 
conduct which anyone could fulftll. 
There was little or no consciousness of 
gay people as a distinct category of 
human being; they could and did fulfill 
these duties as well as anyone else. 
Men known to have erotic interest in 
other men occupied high pos1t1ons, 
were extremely influential and often 
much admired. 

Christianity introduced a different 
set of norms, marginally worse for gay 
people. From about the the fourth cen-
tury of the Christian era to the 
Renaissance, the predominant public 
norm was holiness: a complex concept 
derived from Christian scriptures and 
teaching, social taboos and decorum, 
and personal sentiment. This norm 
could be applied in two ways to gay 
Jleople. They could be viewed as 
"separate but equal"-i.e., bound by 
the same rules of holiness except for 
the variable of gender. A Christian 
ceremony of union for same-gender 
couples perfomed widely in the Early 
Middle Ages, a genre of debates in 
high medieval literature about the 
relative merits of homosexual vs. 
heterosexual love (in which the gay 
side wins two out of three), complaints 
in 
twelfth and thirteenth-century 
literature that gay clerics enjoy special 
advantages- are 
all traces of the 
"separate but equal" approach. 

A second, better-known strand of 
though t opposed homosexual behavior 
categorically. It held that to meet the 
standard of"holiness" a sexual act must 
not only occur within a marriage, but 
also be procreative. This narrower 
view was mostly limited to ascetic 
strains in the 
early church, but 
gradually gained ground in Europe 
from the twelfth to the fourteenth cen-
tury, at a time when many other 
minorities (e.g., Jews) were also incur-
ring greater 
social 
stigma and 
ostracism, and it eventually swept the 
other one before it. By the end of the 
Middle Ages, homosexuality was con-
sidered a serious sin everywhere in 
Europe, and there were penalties for it 
in most civil lawcodes. 

This put gay people in an inferior 
category, but it is crucial to note that it 
was a category everyone else also oc-
cupied at times: what was wrong with 
gay people was that they were sinners, 
but it was "normal" to be a sinner. 
Every human being since the Fall but 
Jesus and the Virgin Mary had been or 
would be a sinner. Even the people 
who promulgated this view of sexuality 
admitted that most conjugal acts per-
formed by most couples did not meet 
its standards; it was, therefore, not so 
disturbing that gay people failed them 
as well. 

It was the modern world that created 
the barriers now isolating gay people 
so effectively. Beginning in the eigh-
teenth century, having for the most 
part lost interest and faith in the 
transcendental values underlying the 
idea of"holiness," European society in-
creasingly replaced it with the concept 
of "normality." And as medicine has 
advanced and the residents of pros-
perous industrialized cultures have 
become more focused on their bodies 
and less interested in non-material 
values, a paramount arena for assess-
ing the "normal" in Western thought 
has come to be "health"- physical and 
psychological.

cause they died in such numbers under
European dominance.

Most human disasters elicit sur-
prises,
good and bad, from the
characters of those drawn into them.
While many instutitions of American
life, most notably the federal govern-
ment, have evinced a spectacular
callousness and indifference to AIDS
and its toll of human suffering, other
communities not traditionally known
for social responsibility or humane
concern have assumed the burdens of
caring for the sick and raising money
and consciousness to combat the
disease. Images of this change in
American society may last as long as
those of the U.S. Congress denying
public funds for AIDS to service
organizations whose members' per-
sonal lives do not meet with their ap-
proval. It is as inspiring to see a
desperately poor Hispanic woman take
in and love her three orphaned grand-
children with AIDS, or a gay man
tenderly care for the dying partner
completely rejected by his family, as it
is depressing to hear Jesse Helms speak
obscenely against dying people whose
personal moral standards he disagrees
with.

Perhaps minority groups have found
strength and purpose,
while
the
political structures charged with public
welfare remain negligent, for the same
reasons
that death and suffering
sometimes elicit tremendous courage
from the weak. Perhaps the scale of the
tragedy and the irruption of the human
reality of sickness and dying into the
hygienic world of the twentieth century
have reminded these communities of a
shared humanity easily forgotten be-
fore a television set, in a comfortable
automobile, physically separated from
the sick and despised. In every age,
before any crisis, the human species in-
spires wonder no more for its mean-
ness and cruelty than for its courage
and greatness of spirit.

Respecting the Strike
Q: What was the strike all about?
A: Well, we ate out , studied alone in
our rooms, and the bathrooms never
got cleaned. For many students, dis-
cussions of the clerical and technical
(C&T) workers' strike of 1984-85
might never delve any deeper. But a
reminder of the actual grounds for
dispute is especially important now, as
negotiations continue toward a con-
tract to succeed the one signed in
January of 1985. On Stn'ke for Respect:
The Clerical and Technical Workers' Strike
at Yale University, 1984-85, fills that bill.
Written by four pro-union activists,
the book chronicles the formation of
Local 34 and the events lea<.iing up to
the union's first contract, offering com-
mentary on labor-management rela-
tions at Yale.

The book's authors- Yale
his-
tory graduate students Toni Gil-
pin and Daniel Letwin, Gary Isaac
(LAW
'85 ),
and Jack
Mc-
Kivigan, associate director of the
Frederick Douglass Papers and a lec-
turer in the History department-have
two aims.
Firs~. they attempt to in-
troduce Local 34 by providing an over-
view of the establishment and contrac-
ting of the union·. Second, the authors
try to extrapolate some general themes
from Local 34's experience about how
to bargain collectively. These goals are
not incompatible. Unfortunately, the
obvious bias with which the authors
portray the Local 34 story precludes
their presenting an objective case study
from which convincing conclusions
may be drawn.

As recounted in On Strike for Respect,
Local 35 of the Federation of Univer-
sity Employees, Yale's union of service
and maintenance workers, successfully
organized Local 34 from within the
campus. Local 34 won certification at
Yale in May of 1983, in what the
authors describe as an emotional elec-
tion that followed 30 years of fai!P.d at-
tempts. The margin of victory was a
slim 39 votes out of 2505.

On Stn'ke for Respect boasts an im-
pressive cast:
Local
34, "whose
membership is mostly female, dispro-
portionately minority, and by and
38 The New J ournal/December 4, 1987
large inexperienced in unions, let
alone strikes;" Local
35,
whose
members realize that "if Yale finds it
can take down one union it's going to
take down all of them;" the aggressive
current president of Local 34, Lucille
Dickess, who contends that "many . . .
joined the union because the value of
their work was ignored by the Univer-
sity;" and John Wilhelm, chief ne-
gotiator for Local 34 and business
manager for Local 35, a man involved
in every major decision made by Local
34 since its inception.

The authors provide a mosaic of in-
terviews that keeps the "homegrown"
and personal aspect of Local 34's strug-
gle at the forefront. Without concen-
trating on any one figure, they portray
a union that depends on its democratic
nature to succeed. In the beginning,
some C&Ts resisted taking an active
role: "I thought that having a union on
campus meant you had organizers,
The authors go out
of their way to
scold the
administration.
and they called meetings and gave you
information and you signed a card; if
they wanted to sign somebody up they
signed them up," one woman said. But
eventually many workers recognized
the potential benefits of shaping their
own union. "People felt 'How•can we
possibly talk about contract proposals
when none of us has ever seen a union
contract before ... ?' But then we
started gradually to realize that all we
had to do was to examine very careful-
ly our work lives here at Yale and how
we would change them . . .. "

The memhers of Local 34 quickly
learned that achieving union status
was "quite a different thing from win-
ning a first contract." Step by step, On
Strike for Respect examines the formula-
tion of union demands, the election of
a negotiating team, and the early bar-
gaining sessions.

Negotiations during November and
December of 1983 proved fruitless.
The union held rallies and vigils to call
attention to their status- no progress.
In March 1984, the union offered to
submit to binding arbitration. The ad-
ministration rejected the proposal. The
union threatened to strike.

In mid-March, Local 35 agreed to
honor Local 34 pickets in the event of a
strike. An interim resolution on April
4 prevented a strike, as the union and
administration agreed to a partial con-
tract codifying language on all issues
resolved to date. This contract left
wage, benefit, ap,d job security issues
outstanding. The spring and summer
months passed without action, and in
fall of 1984 Local 34 again threatened
to strike. On September 26, the union
erected pickets at Yale. Early that
morning, picketers outside the Old
Campus urged passing motorists to
show their support. Many honked in
response.

Ten weeks later, with no new agree-
ment and morale at a low, the mem-
bers of Locals 34 and 35 returned to
their jobs for the two weeks before the
holiday break. They pledged to walk
out again in January if agreements on
both the 34 and 35 contracts (Local
35's contract expired in January of
1985) had not been reached.

The effects of the strike on the C&Ts
are well documented in On Strike for
Respect. Financial hardships affected all
union members. In the first few weeks,
"everybody [got) nervous and [said)
'when are they going to settle? When
are we going back to work? I need
money, my family needs money." La-
ter, local clergy interceded on behalf of
union members to secure postpone-
ments of rent payments. The strike
bore ethical burdens as well. Prior to a
"nonviolent witness" in which de-
monstrators would be arrested, one
woman said, "Last night I had to sit
down with my kids and talk to them
about why I was going to oreak the Jaw
and get arrested after I'd been telling
them for the last ten years, you ·never
break the law; you always do what a
police officer says."

Despite the trials of tl.e union
membership, most media attention
was directed toward the travails of the
students. As the Los Angeles Ti,.,.s
described:

Since September 26, about 400
classes have been moved to chilly
church basements, dimly lit movie
theaters, crowded living rooms, and
packed pizza parlors. Twelve of thir-
teen student dining rooms are clos-
ed. Laboratories are curtailed; the
law school is deserted. Bags of gar-
bage are piled in the halls, dormitory
bathrooms remain uncleaned, and
litter lines the neat Old Campus.
Police on horseback patrol near the
massive Gothic buildings.

The authors posit that this extensive
media coverage, coupled with rallies
and vigils aimed at establishing the
themes of comparable worth and ra-
cism, pressured the administration in-
to acquiescing to a contract and agree-
ing to union demands. But Local 34
already had a partial contract in
September of 1984, which indicah s
that the administration recognized the
new union's legitimacy. Furthermo· ,
this thesis presumes that Local 34 was
indeed victorious in the dispute, an
assumption worth questioning.

In
many cases, the authors' pro-union
biases overwhelm the validity of their
arguments.

Few people, least of all administra-
tion officials, deny that Local 34 con-
trolled public sympathy throughout the
strike. But the importance of public
relations to the final outcome must be
questioned. Certainly the theme-ori-
ented protests made. for excellent press
and were good for union morale, but
to consider their control of public at-
tention as synonymous with
achievements at the bargaining table is
erroneous. For example, the national
mwia focused on the union themes of
"pay equity" and "comparable worth."
The Yale administration had to answer
charges of sexism and racism through-
OUt the strike. But Steve Hamm, the
New
H aven Register reporter who
In 1984, there was nothing in Commons.
covered the strike, points out that for
all the attention this matter received,
"there is no language in the contract
that addresses the pay equity issue
directly."

On another front, the union also
scored away from the negotiating ta-
ble by publicizing the anti-union
reputation of Yale's newly engaged law
firm.
But controversy about
lawyers did not convince the ad-
ministration to change its plans. An at-
torney from the firm t-f'raded the ne-
gotiating team for Yale throughout the
strike. Similarly, the auth01s describe
how the union aroused tremendous
public support for the notion of having
both sides submit outstanding issues to
binding
arbitration.
Once again,
public outcry did not cause the ad-
ministration to include a binding ar-
bitration clause in the Local 34 con-
tract.

in support of their themes, the
authors also omit relevant information
from their accounts. Avowed pro-labor
activists, they clearly want to make the
best possible case for the union and the
worst one for the University; they
neglect to interview any administra-
tion officials who might dispute their
accounts. This approach leads to
misrepresentations.

For instance, the authors go out of
their way to scold the administration
for insisting on holding negotiating
sessions with Local 34 ofT campus.
They do not mention that negotiations
with Local 35 had always been held at
the nearby Park Plaza Hotel, and that
the administration was not establishing
a new precedent for Local 34. In
another section they chide the ad-
ministration for appointing a
ne-
gotiating committee made up of"seven
lower-level administrators and faculty
members." Although this description
of the administration team is accurate
for the outset of the negotiations, the
authors fail to indicate that Yale's vice
president for administration joined the
negotiating team in the fall of 1984,
when a strike seemed imminent.

The authors are also misleading in
their account of salary proposals made
by Yale. They describe Yale's initial
salary proposal in January of 1984,
and comment later that Yale aug-
mented the proposal on the table by
only .4 percent during the month of
April. They never mention that Yale
raised its offer twice during the in-
tervening two months.

On january 19, 1985, 20 months after
certification, Local 34 signed a fuU
contract. Despite powerful evidence
that both sides made concessions, the
authors hail th is contract as a union
victory. Their suggestion that students
of labor relations can draw valuable
lessons from the union 's tactics falls
victim to this unsubstantiated op-
timism.

For a case stu dy to be convincing it
must take an unbiased approach to its
subject, indicate points of contention
or uncertainty, and account for these
factors in its conclusions. Instead, the
authors of On Strilce for Respect sweep
aside information that weakens their
arguments. Written differently, this
book could have been a more suc-
cessful review of the last strike with an
eye to future negotiations. As it is, it
provides excellent insight into Local 34
and the process of union development.
And at least some answers to the stu-
dent asking, "What was the strike all
about?"
