cause they died in such numbers under
European dominance.

Most human disasters elicit sur-
prises,
good and bad, from the
characters of those drawn into them.
While many instutitions of American
life, most notably the federal govern-
ment, have evinced a spectacular
callousness and indifference to AIDS
and its toll of human suffering, other
communities not traditionally known
for social responsibility or humane
concern have assumed the burdens of
caring for the sick and raising money
and consciousness to combat the
disease. Images of this change in
American society may last as long as
those of the U.S. Congress denying
public funds for AIDS to service
organizations whose members' per-
sonal lives do not meet with their ap-
proval. It is as inspiring to see a
desperately poor Hispanic woman take
in and love her three orphaned grand-
children with AIDS, or a gay man
tenderly care for the dying partner
completely rejected by his family, as it
is depressing to hear Jesse Helms speak
obscenely against dying people whose
personal moral standards he disagrees
with.

Perhaps minority groups have found
strength and purpose,
while
the
political structures charged with public
welfare remain negligent, for the same
reasons
that death and suffering
sometimes elicit tremendous courage
from the weak. Perhaps the scale of the
tragedy and the irruption of the human
reality of sickness and dying into the
hygienic world of the twentieth century
have reminded these communities of a
shared humanity easily forgotten be-
fore a television set, in a comfortable
automobile, physically separated from
the sick and despised. In every age,
before any crisis, the human species in-
spires wonder no more for its mean-
ness and cruelty than for its courage
and greatness of spirit.
