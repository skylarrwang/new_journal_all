Dangerous Decisions 
Jennifer Sachs 
Over winter break, workers will install 
two coin-operated condom dispensers 
in each of Yale's residential colleges. 
These dispensers, filled with brand 
name, medicated latex condoms, will 
be located in the single-sex bathrooms 
next to the dining halls. Though 
students might prefer to have them 
nearer to their bedrooms, the ma-
chines will at least be closer than Store 
24, or WaWa's, or the pharmacy at 
University H ealth Services (UHS). By 
installing the condom dispensers, Yale 
will be publicly committing itself to 


certain assumptions about its un-
dergraduate population: 
that 
Yale 
students are sexually active, and that a 
percentage may already carry the virus 
that can cause AIDS. 

The proposal to install the dis-
pensers originated in July and gained 
acceptance only last month- the lag 
due partly to summer inertia, but 
mostly to bureaucratic tie-ups. Yale 
College Dean Sidney Altman said in 
early November that he was "not 
aware" of the particulars of discussions 
regarding the dispensers and that the 
decision to install them rested in the 
hands of the Council of Masters. The 
chair of that group, Berkeley Master 
Robin Winks, refers specific inquiries 
to Dr. Daniel Rowe, Director of Uni-
versity H ealth. Rowe says he has had 
the dispensers ready to go for some 
time, but needed approval from the 
Dean's office. 

This delay points to a peculiar pro-
blem in the care and treatment of 
AIDS. The disease affects so many 
facets of society that it has blurred the 
boundaries of responsibility: health 
care providers now act as judges of se-X-
ual practices, and public officials daily 
confront issues of medical ethics. 

Defining a response to AIDS that bal-
ances these separate concerns can tax 
the resources and imagination of an y 
instit1,1tion. A confused or halfhearted 
response, however, could be fatal to 
the students, the financial health, and 
the vitality of Yale. 

Last April the University hired Sally 
Rinaldi, a registered nurse with a 
master's degree in public health, as its 
AIDS educator. Rinaldi came from 
Yale-New Haven H ospital, where she 
had served in a similar capacity. She 
works at UHS three days a week, com-
.piling AIDS information and answer-
ing 
telephone queries about 
the 
disease. She also helps to coordinate 
the AIDS education program of guest 
speakers, information for freshman 
counselors, and pamphlets. The pro-
gram tries to encourage students to 
practict' "safer sex," defined as sexual 
activity in which partners do not ex-
change fluids- such 
as semen or 
saliva-which 
might transmit the 
AIDS virus. 

R owe, whose cheerful optimism has 
endeared him to his staff, seems en-
thusiastic about his new employee. 
H er presence here, he feels, means that 
"Yale has made a real commitment to 
AIDS education." Cathe·rine Teare 
(ES '88), who works as Rinaldi's assis-
tant, disagrees. "She can't do an ex-
cellent job in a half-time position. And 
she's hamstrung by the administration, 
who won't allow anything too explicit 
to be put out." The pamphlets dis-
tributed at UHS show couples in dis-
creetly sexual poses: arms caressing 
shoulders, hands on backs. Posters on 
the ground floor of the Health Services 
building, of a green blob carrying a 
gun or a spear. above the warning 
"AIDS KILLS," do not conjure up 
thoughts of sex, responsible or other-
wise. 

"A lot of the girls we're 
messing around with 
we've been messing 
around with since 
freshman year." 

Rinaldi's main accomplishment at 
Yale has been to encourage the forma-
tion of student groups to educate their 
peers. She assisted the organizers of 
the AIDS Task Force at Yale (AT-
FAY), of which Teare is a member, in 
planning AIDS Education and P reven-
tion Week in November. Rinaldi also 
works with about a dozen students, 
many from ATF A Y, who will parti-
cipate in monthly educational forums 
and presentations on the disease. Ad-
ministrators feel that the most effective 
dissemination of information about 
AIDS occurs when students hear it 
from their peers. ATFAY has at-
tempted to reach the undergraduate 
heterosexual 
population with con-
troversial table tents that tell the story 
of a monogamous couple's discovery, 
right before graduation, that both part-
ners carry the virus. These efforts, like 
Rinaldi's, falter, 
because would-be 
educators often do not know what spe-
cific knowledge gaps exist or how to 
address them. "It has to be discussed 
among students," Teare says. "But I 
don't know how it can be done. For all 
I know, everyone knows all about 
AIDS and practicing safe sex- but I 
d oubt it." 

Other schools have begun to ex-
amine the level of awareness about 
AIDS on their campuses, and the sta-
tistics have not been encouraging. An 
article in the February Chronicle of 
Higher Education reported that 74 per-
cent of 13,000 students surveyed at 
Stanford did 
not discuss sexually 
transmitted diseases with their part-
ners, and more than a quarter did not 
know what constituted "safe sex·." An 
u nofficial survey conducted on 2000 
students at Brown University last 
spring revealed that only 24 percent 
had changed 
their sexual 
habits 
because of knowledge about AIDS. 
And a 
University of Connecticut 
psychology professor recently released 
the results of a questionnaire which 
showed that 70 percent of the students 
he interviewed practiced what he term-
ed "unsafe sex." 

H ow does Yale compare? The 'Uni-
versity has not undertaken any com-
prehensive studies to gauge either the 
extent of sexual activity or the effects of 
AIDS awareness on students here. 
Although Altman, Rinaldi, and other 
health officials all voice concern that 
many Ya.le students ignore the dangers 
of AIDS, none has specific information 
to support these fears. Rather, they 
base them on assumptions about the 
nature of being a college student: "I 
remember being one myself," Altman 
says. "There's a tendency to think that 
you're immortal."

**Perspectives**

Dr. Daniel Rowe, director of University Health Services: He proposed the condom 
machines to protect "my population." 

Conversations and interviews with 
undergraduate men' and ""omen sug-
gest that they are neither as cautious as 
Altman would like them to be, nor as 
ignorant as Teare s~spects they are. 
On this campus, the level of awareness 
about the medical aspects of the 
disease- facts and fallacies about 
transmission and the types of behavior 
that contribute to risk- appears fairly 
high. Most of the approximately 30 
respondents to an unscientific survey 
of 300 undergraduates indicated that 
they knew AIDS could not be trans-
mitted easily: "not by casual contact, 
shared razors; in general, very difficult 
to transmit. ... " 

Knowledge does not always cor-
relate with attitudes, though, and 
many Yale undergraduates seem to 
share a comfortable feeling of isolation 
and insularity from the disease. Almost 
all students responding to the surve), 
except those who said they were vir-
gins, acknowledged some measure of 
personal danger. when asked directly if 
they were at risk. But answers to a 
more general question, "Who is at 
risk? " did not always include the 
respondent. "Mostly homosexuals and 
H aitians and people from Zaire," one 
replied. 
Another an-
swered, 
"prostitutes 
and 
their 
'customers,' men who've had homo-

sexual intercourse, IV drug users, peo~ 
ple from Haiti, Zaire, and a few other 
countries." 

Even when speaking directly about 
AIDS at Yale, students can avoid con-
fronting its relevance to them. J ohn 
Rozen says that he thinks about AIDS 
fairly often, and he knows that the 
disease has affected many different 
groups: "Male homosexuals, IV drug 
users, and women who sleep with a lot 
of guys." He doesn't think that A IDS 
poses a particular threat to "his circle," 
especially since most of his friends-are 
not gay. They sleep with. numerous 
women, usually use condoms, and do 
not discuss the possibility of disease 
before or after sexual activity. "Discus-
sion breaks up the continuity of sex," 
he says, smiling. 

As evidence of his own 
invul-
nerability, Rozen cites recent studies 
indicating that male-to-female 
transmission of the AIDS virus is more 
likely than female-to-male transmis-
sion. Fraternity brothers Tom Blake 
and William Klein, however, now 
treat women as calculated risks. They 
have cut down on their "roadtripping," 
using condoms when they do but pre-
ferring to date women whose sexual 
histories they can determine. "There's 
more incentive to be with someone you 
know," Blake says. He and Klein have 
PERSPECTIVES 
an "AIDS index," a one-to-ten scale by 
which they rate the likelihood of infec-
tion of their women friends. 

Michael Lindgren, an outgoing he-
terosexual man who rarely uses con-
doms because they are "a pain in the 
ass," agrees that some degree of 
knowledge about a partner's sexual 
history is helpful. The college com-
munity is so small, he adds, that "a lot 
of the girls we're messing around with 
we've been messing around with since 
freshman year," and he knows which of 
his friends have slept with which 
women. "That's what's nice about 
Yale," he says. 

Rationales like this nearly bring Dr. 
Robert DeBernardo out of his seat. 
The clinical immunologist, who heads 
the AIDS policy' committee at UHS 
and serves as the Medical Coordinator 
for AIDS, responded to this outlook in 
a November 6 editorial to the Yale 
Daily News. In it, he wrote that "No 
matter how careful one may be, after 
enough different partners you will en-
counter an infected partner .· ... If 
one out of every thousand airplane 
flights 
crashed, 
would you 
fly?." 

DeBernardo also disputes the conten-
tion that condom use alone can protect 
against AIDS. Ht> says that infection is 
"strictly a statistical sort of thing. Cer-
tainly the rate of transmission is not 
100 percent. And certainly it's not 
zero. You can take your choice in be-
tween." Although opinions on the ef-
ficacy of condoms vary, studies that 
show them to have a 30 percent failure 
rate in preventing gonorrhea seem to 
indicate that they are not failsafe. 

DeBernardo warns that, while people 
should use condoms, he does not ad-
vocate "using them and forgetting 
everything else." The ideal option, he 
says, is a monogamous relationship in 
which both partners know they do not 
carry the virus. 

Heterosexual women may need to 
follow his advice more closely than 
their male partners. Female suscep-
tibility to AIDS has received national 
media attention, especially with there-
cent news that women tend to die more 
quickly of the disease. During AIDS 
Education and Prevention Week, a
