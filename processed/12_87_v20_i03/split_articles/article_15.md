their progress with the biofeedback 
machine. Corrao uses biofeedback for 
measuring jaw muscle tension; the 
technique has proved successful also in 
treating migraines. 

Studies on the medical effectiveness 
of biofeedback and relaxation response 
reveal clear benefits for those in the

Kraemer. But she emphasizes that 
stress alone does not cause heart 
disease, though it increases the risk.

studies for non-disease patients, Watts
