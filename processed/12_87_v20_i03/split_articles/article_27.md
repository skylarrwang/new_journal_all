Respecting the Strike
Q: What was the strike all about?
A: Well, we ate out , studied alone in
our rooms, and the bathrooms never
got cleaned. For many students, dis-
cussions of the clerical and technical
(C&T) workers' strike of 1984-85
might never delve any deeper. But a
reminder of the actual grounds for
dispute is especially important now, as
negotiations continue toward a con-
tract to succeed the one signed in
January of 1985. On Stn'ke for Respect:
The Clerical and Technical Workers' Strike
at Yale University, 1984-85, fills that bill.
Written by four pro-union activists,
the book chronicles the formation of
Local 34 and the events lea<.iing up to
the union's first contract, offering com-
mentary on labor-management rela-
tions at Yale.

The book's authors- Yale
his-
tory graduate students Toni Gil-
pin and Daniel Letwin, Gary Isaac
(LAW
'85 ),
and Jack
Mc-
Kivigan, associate director of the
Frederick Douglass Papers and a lec-
turer in the History department-have
two aims.
Firs~. they attempt to in-
troduce Local 34 by providing an over-
view of the establishment and contrac-
ting of the union·. Second, the authors
try to extrapolate some general themes
from Local 34's experience about how
to bargain collectively. These goals are
not incompatible. Unfortunately, the
obvious bias with which the authors
portray the Local 34 story precludes
their presenting an objective case study
from which convincing conclusions
may be drawn.

As recounted in On Strike for Respect,
Local 35 of the Federation of Univer-
sity Employees, Yale's union of service
and maintenance workers, successfully
organized Local 34 from within the
campus. Local 34 won certification at
Yale in May of 1983, in what the
authors describe as an emotional elec-
tion that followed 30 years of fai!P.d at-
tempts. The margin of victory was a
slim 39 votes out of 2505.

On Stn'ke for Respect boasts an im-
pressive cast:
Local
34, "whose
membership is mostly female, dispro-
portionately minority, and by and
38 The New J ournal/December 4, 1987
large inexperienced in unions, let
alone strikes;" Local
35,
whose
members realize that "if Yale finds it
can take down one union it's going to
take down all of them;" the aggressive
current president of Local 34, Lucille
Dickess, who contends that "many . . .
joined the union because the value of
their work was ignored by the Univer-
sity;" and John Wilhelm, chief ne-
gotiator for Local 34 and business
manager for Local 35, a man involved
in every major decision made by Local
34 since its inception.

The authors provide a mosaic of in-
terviews that keeps the "homegrown"
and personal aspect of Local 34's strug-
gle at the forefront. Without concen-
trating on any one figure, they portray
a union that depends on its democratic
nature to succeed. In the beginning,
some C&Ts resisted taking an active
role: "I thought that having a union on
campus meant you had organizers,
The authors go out
of their way to
scold the
administration.
and they called meetings and gave you
information and you signed a card; if
they wanted to sign somebody up they
signed them up," one woman said. But
eventually many workers recognized
the potential benefits of shaping their
own union. "People felt 'How•can we
possibly talk about contract proposals
when none of us has ever seen a union
contract before ... ?' But then we
started gradually to realize that all we
had to do was to examine very careful-
ly our work lives here at Yale and how
we would change them . . .. "

The memhers of Local 34 quickly
learned that achieving union status
was "quite a different thing from win-
ning a first contract." Step by step, On
Strike for Respect examines the formula-
tion of union demands, the election of
a negotiating team, and the early bar-
gaining sessions.

Negotiations during November and
December of 1983 proved fruitless.
The union held rallies and vigils to call
attention to their status- no progress.
In March 1984, the union offered to
submit to binding arbitration. The ad-
ministration rejected the proposal. The
union threatened to strike.

In mid-March, Local 35 agreed to
honor Local 34 pickets in the event of a
strike. An interim resolution on April
4 prevented a strike, as the union and
administration agreed to a partial con-
tract codifying language on all issues
resolved to date. This contract left
wage, benefit, ap,d job security issues
outstanding. The spring and summer
months passed without action, and in
fall of 1984 Local 34 again threatened
to strike. On September 26, the union
erected pickets at Yale. Early that
morning, picketers outside the Old
Campus urged passing motorists to
show their support. Many honked in
response.

Ten weeks later, with no new agree-
ment and morale at a low, the mem-
bers of Locals 34 and 35 returned to
their jobs for the two weeks before the
holiday break. They pledged to walk
out again in January if agreements on
both the 34 and 35 contracts (Local
35's contract expired in January of
1985) had not been reached.

The effects of the strike on the C&Ts
are well documented in On Strike for
Respect. Financial hardships affected all
union members. In the first few weeks,
"everybody [got) nervous and [said)
'when are they going to settle? When
are we going back to work? I need
money, my family needs money." La-
ter, local clergy interceded on behalf of
union members to secure postpone-
ments of rent payments. The strike
bore ethical burdens as well. Prior to a
"nonviolent witness" in which de-
monstrators would be arrested, one
woman said, "Last night I had to sit
down with my kids and talk to them
about why I was going to oreak the Jaw
and get arrested after I'd been telling
them for the last ten years, you ·never
break the law; you always do what a
police officer says."

Despite the trials of tl.e union
membership, most media attention
was directed toward the travails of the
students. As the Los Angeles Ti,.,.s
described:

Since September 26, about 400
classes have been moved to chilly
church basements, dimly lit movie
theaters, crowded living rooms, and
packed pizza parlors. Twelve of thir-
teen student dining rooms are clos-
ed. Laboratories are curtailed; the
law school is deserted. Bags of gar-
bage are piled in the halls, dormitory
bathrooms remain uncleaned, and
litter lines the neat Old Campus.
Police on horseback patrol near the
massive Gothic buildings.

The authors posit that this extensive
media coverage, coupled with rallies
and vigils aimed at establishing the
themes of comparable worth and ra-
cism, pressured the administration in-
to acquiescing to a contract and agree-
ing to union demands. But Local 34
already had a partial contract in
September of 1984, which indicah s
that the administration recognized the
new union's legitimacy. Furthermo· ,
this thesis presumes that Local 34 was
indeed victorious in the dispute, an
assumption worth questioning.

In
many cases, the authors' pro-union
biases overwhelm the validity of their
arguments.

Few people, least of all administra-
tion officials, deny that Local 34 con-
trolled public sympathy throughout the
strike. But the importance of public
relations to the final outcome must be
questioned. Certainly the theme-ori-
ented protests made. for excellent press
and were good for union morale, but
to consider their control of public at-
tention as synonymous with
achievements at the bargaining table is
erroneous. For example, the national
mwia focused on the union themes of
"pay equity" and "comparable worth."
The Yale administration had to answer
charges of sexism and racism through-
OUt the strike. But Steve Hamm, the
New
H aven Register reporter who

covered the strike, points out that for
all the attention this matter received,
"there is no language in the contract
that addresses the pay equity issue
directly."

On another front, the union also
scored away from the negotiating ta-
ble by publicizing the anti-union
reputation of Yale's newly engaged law
firm.
But controversy about
lawyers did not convince the ad-
ministration to change its plans. An at-
torney from the firm t-f'raded the ne-
gotiating team for Yale throughout the
strike. Similarly, the auth01s describe
how the union aroused tremendous
public support for the notion of having
both sides submit outstanding issues to
binding
arbitration.
Once again,
public outcry did not cause the ad-
ministration to include a binding ar-
bitration clause in the Local 34 con-
tract.

in support of their themes, the
authors also omit relevant information
from their accounts. Avowed pro-labor
activists, they clearly want to make the
best possible case for the union and the
worst one for the University; they
neglect to interview any administra-
tion officials who might dispute their
accounts. This approach leads to
misrepresentations.

For instance, the authors go out of
their way to scold the administration
for insisting on holding negotiating
sessions with Local 34 ofT campus.
They do not mention that negotiations
with Local 35 had always been held at
the nearby Park Plaza Hotel, and that
the administration was not establishing
a new precedent for Local 34. In
another section they chide the ad-
ministration for appointing a
ne-
gotiating committee made up of"seven
lower-level administrators and faculty
members." Although this description
of the administration team is accurate
for the outset of the negotiations, the
authors fail to indicate that Yale's vice
president for administration joined the
negotiating team in the fall of 1984,
when a strike seemed imminent.

The authors are also misleading in
their account of salary proposals made
by Yale. They describe Yale's initial
salary proposal in January of 1984,
and comment later that Yale aug-
mented the proposal on the table by
only .4 percent during the month of
April. They never mention that Yale
raised its offer twice during the in-
tervening two months.

On january 19, 1985, 20 months after
certification, Local 34 signed a fuU
contract. Despite powerful evidence
that both sides made concessions, the
authors hail th is contract as a union
victory. Their suggestion that students
of labor relations can draw valuable
lessons from the union 's tactics falls
victim to this unsubstantiated op-
timism.

For a case stu dy to be convincing it
must take an unbiased approach to its
subject, indicate points of contention
or uncertainty, and account for these
factors in its conclusions. Instead, the
authors of On Strilce for Respect sweep
aside information that weakens their
arguments. Written differently, this
book could have been a more suc-
cessful review of the last strike with an
eye to future negotiations. As it is, it
provides excellent insight into Local 34
and the process of union development.
And at least some answers to the stu-
dent asking, "What was the strike all
about?"
