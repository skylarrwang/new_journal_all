now accounts for only 17 percent of 
AIDS cases nationally. But in New 
H aven well over 60 percent of all 
AIDS cases are intravenous dru& 
abusers, the sexual partners of IVD 
abusers, or the children of an IVD 
abusing parent. 

AIDS has brought an added dimen-
sion of danger and fear to an already 
horrible probl~m. IVD abusers have 
always faced a debilitating addiction; 
but before AIDS, they at worst risked 
catching hepatitis from sharing a nee-
dle. Physical addiction, isolation, and 
financial destitution still lead addicts to 
use dirty "works." Now, however, 
AIDS threatens to infect and kill 
thousands of IVD abusers, their sexual 
partners, and their children. 

Homosexual and bisexual men still 
account for two-thirds of the 57,000 
AIDS cases nationwide, but many gay 
men have responded by practicing safe 
sex and reducing promiscuity. In cities 
like San Francisco, the gay population 
is primarily white, middle class, and 
literate. AIDS information reaches the 
homosexual community through stan-
dard educational channels. Those who 
wish to reduce risk of contact with the 
disease can change their sexual habits 
In comparison, IVD abusers must 
survive in an isolated world. While 
homosexuals can fight the disease as a 
community, no community of IVD 
abusers exists, other than in "shooting 
galleries" where addicts gather to pur-
chase and shoot heroin and co-
caine- where the chance of exposure 
to HIV from contaminated needles 
runs highest. Heroin users do not 
discriminate when desperate for the 
drug that they need. Unlike unsafe 
sexual practices, hero;n abuse is addic-
tive and almost impossible to beat 
alone. 
"It's 
total 
madness," said 
Malcolm, a 35-year-old reformed IVD 
addict. "A lot of people are thrown in 
and there's no getting out alone. I've 
never seen anyone pull themselves 
out." 

Often homeless or indigent, New 
Haven's almost 10,000 IVD abusers 
·are vulnerable like no other risk group. 
According to officials at the Connec-
ticut State H ealth Department, only 
1,060 of those IVD abusers are known 
to be undergoing any form of drug 
abuse treatment. Even those who wish 
to enter a program often cannot. A 
three to four month waiting list forces 
addicts seeking treatment to continue 
to deal with their addiction alone. 
AIDS has made those three or four 
months a time in which they could 
easily contract a disease which no 
clinical treatment can cure. 

Geraldine Bryant can speak con-
fidently 
about the 
IVD-abusing 
population. As director of the Orchard 
Street Methadone Clinic and a mem-
ber of the Mayor's Task Force on 
AIDS, she has become an outspoken 
activist for AIDS education in New 
Haven. Her clinic, one of three 
methadone units run by the APT 
foundation. a nonprofit organization 
By 1992 Connecticut 
can expect a death 
rate of five to ten 
people a day from 
AIDS. 
for the treatment of substance abuse, 
administers methadone to some 280 
reforming IVD abusers. A synthetic 
narcotic, methadone is itself an addic-
tive drug which alleviates withdrawal 
symptoms and stops craving without 
giving a "high." 

For Bryant and her staff, dealing 
with intravenous drug abuse is a trying 
job in its own right. AIDS has brought 
new dimensions to their work. "The 
true stress comes from seeing someone 
whose life is debilitated by drugs. but 
who comes in for treatment," Bryant 
said. "They begin to turn around their 
world. A mother with children begins 
'to be concerned about their welfare, 
health, and appearance. She gets a job, 
and then she comes in and tells us she 
has AIDS." Approximately 25 percent 
of APT's methadone patients who have 


consented to be tested are HIV posi-
tive. That statistic, spread out over the 
other 8,800 IVD abusers in New 
Haven who have never entered treat-
ment, suggests that up to 2,200 IVD 
abusers are now out there, out of touch 
and unaware that they carry the AIDS 
virus. 

"There are people who are out there 
using, who may not have contracted 
[AIDS] but will if they continue to stay 
out there," Bryant said. "They will 
share needles and works if they .are 
desperate or ill. They are not con-
cerned about catching a disease at that 
point in their life. They will catch it 
and spread it because they cannot get 
into treatment." 

The waiting list for methadone 
treatment and the IVD abusers who 
are now known to be H IV positive 
only partially indicate the seriousness 
of New H aven's AIDS crisis. New 
Haven currently has 119 cases of 
diagnosed full-blown AIDS, the stage 
of the disease in which opportunistic 
infections attack the body. H owever, a 
report issued recently by the Mayor's 
Task Force on AIDS estimates that 
about 6,000 people in New Haven are 
now HIV positive. By 1991 New Ha-
ven can expect 700 to 800 cases of full-
blown AIDS, many more cases of 
ARC (AIDS-related complex), and 
thousands who are HIV positive. Most 
of the individuals who will come down 
with full-blown AIDS by 1991 are al-
ready infected. It is too late to save 
them. 

New Haven now faces two major 
problems. First, it must prepare. the 
city and its health care programs for 
the wave of dying young people which 
will flood the city's hospitals in the 
years to come. By 1992 Connecticut 
can expect a death rate of five to ten 
people a day from AIDS. Second, New 
Haven must begin to work toward sav-
ing the thousands of others, mostly 
poor minorities associated with IVD 
abuse, who risk infection. City workers 
and volunteers have only begun to ad-
dress these problems. 

Bryant believes that to prevent addicts 
from becoming infected, outreach wor-
kers must teach them to use drugs safe-
ly. Though some cities considered 
distributing free needles, fear of pro-
moting IVD abuse ruled out that op-
tion. The alternative in New Haven 
and elsewhere is to teach IVD addicts 
to sterilize their needles and to supply 
them with the necessary materials-
bleach or alcohol packets. At the same 
time, outreach workers distribute con-
doms and discuss safer sex practices to 
protect the partners of IVD abusers. 

Educators can reach potential AIDS 
vJcttms 
only 
by 
penetrating 
the 
neighborhoods, schools, soup kitchens, 
and welfare motels. But once inside, 
outreach workers still face the barrier 
of an "unbelieving" community. Accor-
ding to Bryant, IVD abusers often 
think that they are immortal. "No mat-
ter how much you warn them, they 
believe AIDS is a distant, far-off threat 
and that it could never happen to 
them." 

she said. "Intravenous drug 
users have experienced so much that is 
terrible .in life and have survived. 
They are convinced that their luck is 
going to hold out. We know this is not 
true." Even if successful, outreach 
education will begin to show effects on-
ly three to seven years after full-scale 
programs are implemented, according 
to the Mayor's Task Force report. 

Much time and many lives will pass 
before New Haven can begin counting 
off those years. Outreach education re-
mains far from adequate. 

Only this October the city govern-
ment dedicated three full-time workers 
from the city Health Department to 
AIDS outreach. 
They will 
enter 
neighborhoods and communities cut 
off from AIDS education to work with 
IVD abusers, referring them to drug 
treatment centers. The city initiated 
the program at the recommendation of 
the Mayor's Task Force on AIDS, 
which Mayor Biagio DiLieto created 

last year to coordinate AIDS services 
in New Haven. 

"We're no strangers to any of this," 
said Dominick Maldonado. "These are 
our own communities." Maldonado 
worked for eight years at Crossroads, a 
45-bed residential facility for the treat· 
ment of IVD addicts in New H aven, 
before becoming one of the city's 
outreach workers. The move from 
Crossroads to the streets will not be dif-
ficult for him. He grew up in New 
Haven, and knows the streets well. He 
has seen friends become IVD addicts, 
and he has seen friends die from 
AIDS. Yet Maldonado remains op· 
timistic about the IVD community. 

"The majority of addicts do want to 
change," he said. "But you cannot tell 
them to stop using until they are ready 
themselves. All you can do in the 
meantime is make the connection be· 
tween drugs and AIDS, and teach 
them to use [drugs] safely if they're go-
ing to use at all." Despite his optimism, 
Maldonado admits that three outreach 
workers cannot educate thousands .of 
addicts. 

Fortunately, they are not a.lone. 
Long before the city government 
began to take action, a few privately 
run community groups like AIDS Pro-
ject New Haven (APNH) carried the 
burden of outreach. APNH began in 
1983, soon after the first AIDS cases in 
New Haven were diagnosed. Those 
patients were mostly gay, and APNH 
began as a resource for New Haven's 
gay population, providing an AIDS 
hotline, referral, counseling, and sup· 
port services. These services have ex-
panded. But as the majority of AIDS 
patients in New Haven shifted from 
homosexuals to IVD abusers, APNH 
found itself revising its tactics to ac-
commodate a population with many dif-
ferent social problems. Working out of 
a one-room office at College and Elm 
streets, APNH now deals principally 
With IVD users and their sexual part· 
ners. Where posters, pamphlets, pub-
lic forums, and talks once sufficed for 
risk education, APNH outreach 
Workers must now pound the streets, 
P&ssing out condoms and bleach, 
COunseling, an'd making referrals to 
drug treatment centers. 

"To have an impact you can't have a 
distanced approach," said George Ap-
pleby, chairman of the board of 
APNH. Appleby is a member of both 
the Mayors and Governors Task Forces 
on A IDS, and sits on the faculty of the 
Graduate School of Social Work at 
Southern Connecticut University. He 
became involved in AIDS work in 
1984, soon after his best friend died of 
the disease. "You need immediate per· 
sonal contact. Eighty-five percent of 
the IVD users out there are unknowns 
who haven't come in for treatment, 
and they don't wear signs." 

APNH now has over 150 part-time 
"By being an AIDS 
worker you share the 
pariah status of the 
people you work 
.th " 
volunteers staffing their various 
counseling and support services, but 
only six part-time outreach workers. 
Appleby realizes the desperate need for 
more workers, but volunteers commit· 
ted to street work are hard to find. The 
work is difficult and intimidating. 

Many APNH volunteers burn out 
from too much time and stress in the 
field. 

"When your volunteers are 
primarily white, middle-class people 
trying to relate to poor blacks and 
Hispanics, it can be difficult building 
up a system of trust," Appleby said. 
"Working the streets is not something 
we feel comfortable with, but it has to 
be done. We're concerned with getting 
to all the populations we need to." 

These concerns have led workers to the 
shooting galleries themselves, where 
drug suppliers allow workers to enter 
safely and pass out alcohol or bleach 
for cleaning works. "It protects their 
clientele, as strange as that sounds," 
Appleby said. Workers must contend 
with other barriers, such as addicts' 
distrust of outside assistance arising 
from fear of the narcotic officers who
