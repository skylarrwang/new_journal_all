talk on Women and AIDS was one of the 
best attended events, attracting a 
crowd of over 30 women and two or 
three men. Chris Norwood, the fea-
tured speaker, noted that heterosexual 
women show an infection rate three 
times that of other groups, including 
intravenous drug users. Perhaps as a 
result of the barrage of publicity, some 
women express almost irrational fears 
of infection. Sarah Crocker has had 
only two sexual relationships in the 
past three years, one of these long-term 
and monogamous. In the other,- her 
boyfriend and she were so careful that

jokes. Yet she still fears infection so 
much that she has considered getting 
tested for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIY), the virus which can cause 
AID S. 

C rocker admits that her fear might 
seem like paranoia, and probably is ex-
cessive. She blames a society that puts 
most of the onus for sexual respon-
sibility on its women. "Women have 
always internalized a responsibility for 
sex that men haven't. It's less affrontive 
to their consciousness to have to think 
about sex," she says. Since the news 
that condoms provide a degree of pro-
!ection against AIDS, advertising has 
Increased dramatically, nearly all of it 
directed at women. Rebecca Patter-
son, a single senior woman, says she 
has considered purchasing a supply of 
condoms to keep in her room. If a 
sexual situation arose and neither she 
nor her partner were prepared, she 
says, "I can certainly see where I would 
be- I don't know if lazy is the right 
word -lax enough not to actually use a 
condom." She blushes. "But buying 
condoms would be pathetic, consider-
ing I'm not sexually active at the mo-
ment." According to recent market 
surveys, women have begun to pur-
chase condoms in much larger num-
bers than they did before the AIDS 
epidemic. 

PERSPECTIVES 
H IV postt1vtty, he does not think he 
has AIDS. 

Schleicher's relaxed attitude finds its 
opposite in one who, like Crocker, ap-
parently has little to fear. Neil Orne 
has had one relationship since he came 
out at the end of his sophomore year, 
with a man who had practiced safer sex 
with his former partners. Still, he was 
so terrified at the prospect of AIDS 
that he convinced his boyfriend to get 
tested. "We talked about it a lot. I was 
very scared ... unreasonably so," he 
now admits. The test was negative, but 
Orne still considers taking one himself. 
"Someday I may get tested just to have 
a 
piece of paper 
that says I'm 
negative." 

He and Klein have an 
"AIDS index" by 
which they rate the 
likelihood of infection

thought to be somehow more suscepti-
ble to the disease, attitudes and prac-
tices began changing years ago. Adam 
Stone, .a gay junior, says that "every 
person that I've slept with at Yale has 
practiced 
safe sex. 
It was never 
brought up, it just happened." Stone, 
whose room is decorated with .UHS 
safe sex pamphlets, has had six or 
seven partners since he came to Yale; 
he does not have anal sex, would not 
perform fellatio, and avoids deep kiss-
ing. H e also does not sleep with 
women, although other gay men here 
do.

considered taking the ELISA test 
which, with approximately a 95 per-

argues that the high number of false 
results makes the test useless in any 
case: "I'd rather live

outweighs any potential benefits to 
those who already use condoms and 
practice safer sex.
