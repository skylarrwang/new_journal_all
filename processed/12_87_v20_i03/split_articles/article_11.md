The Body Politic 
"Look around Yale. You don't see a 
pregnant woman walking around this 
campus." 

A woman defending the pro-choice 
stance on abortion was speaking at a 
recent forum. True enough, I thought. 
I did not even have to pause 路in an 
attempt to recall any pregnant women 
I might have seen in class, in the 
library, in the dining hall. I followed 
her subsequent pro-choice arguments 
also without a pause. 

Unplanned 
pregnancy disrupts 
woman's 
education and employment, many 
times leaving her in economic and 
emotional 
despair. These familiar 
arguments defending the right to 
abortion provide the basis for my own 
feminism. 

Two days later, as I sat across a 
dining hall table from three women of 
Students 
Life, 
pro-life 
organization on campus1 that basic 
understanding seemed vaguely 
threatened. The lac~ of direct clash 
between their pro-life arguments and 
my pro-choice beliefs bewildered me. 

Over and over, these women threw out 
the same words, the same rhetoric, 
that I had heard in the mouths of pro-
choice believers. As we talked, I had 
the strange sensation that words had 
separat~'d from meanings and were 
floating freely around the table. 

"Look around Yale," Shannon 
Summers (BR '90) said. "You don't see 
a pregnant woman on this campus." 
She continued, "This institution is 
not gtvmg women options. It 1s 
sending out 
signals 
that 
woman cannot have a baby and be a 
student here. There is no room for a 
pregnant woman at Yale." The degree 
to which her argument reflected rr:y 
assumptions about a woman's choice 
disconcerted me. Yes, a woman should 
have the option. to have a child, if she 
so chooses. Yes, there should be a 
"place" for a pregnant woman. But 
does this reasoning constitute a "pro-
life" argument or a 
"pro-choice" 
argument with a different emphasis? 

And does feminism have room for both 
ideologies? 

I heard the strong words of Katie 
Oberlies(LA W '88):"I am a member of 
6 The New JournaVDecember 4 , 1987 
Students for Life, and I am a feminist." 
To this woman, the right to abortion 
did not lie at the center of feminism. 
She did not expect her stance on the 
issue to place her outside the move-
ment. Then she and other members of 
Students for Life sought inclusion in 
the Yale Women's Center. The Center 
decided that the right to abortion 
contained such 
basic femionist 
significance- a 
woman's right 
privacy in terms of her own body- as 
to make it a 
definitive line for 

Feminists could 
have 
differing opm10ns on prostitution, 
pornography, or the ERA, but not on 
abortion. Students for Life fell on the 
wrong side of the line and found 
themselves defined out of feminism 
and the Center. 

Traditional definitions of feminism 
exclude many women from 
the 
women's movement, just as they 
exclude Students for Life from the 
Women's Center. In fact, women have 
no unified political ideology and no 
comprehensive way of defining their 
interests. Not all women call them-
selves 路feminists, and we can easily 
acknowledge this division. 

But 
accepting the idea of division and
I ' 
political difference within the ranks of 
feminists 
becomes more 
difficult. 
Definitions of feminism -mean 
different, 
possibly contradictory, 
things. When one woman's feminism 
undermines the validity of another 
woman's, the larger whole of the 
movement begins to lose meaning. 

The questions facing the Women's 
Center-and any organization which 
calls 
itself simply "women's"- go 
beyond the incessant questioning of 
whose feminism counts as real. For at 
some point the women's movement has 
to reconcile its relationship to an 
incredibly diverse body of women. Is 
the movement obligated to include all 
the views of women merely because 
they are held by women? Or is the 
primary commitment not to some 
inclusive 
representation but to a 
specific political agenda, a specific 
feminism? 

The Women's Center dealt with 
these questions when it reevaluated its 
statement of purpose. That statement 
grew out of the realization that the 
Women's Center had run- up against 
rbe wall of its own homogeneity. In 
restructuring the Center with the路hope 
that it would become a "place for all
