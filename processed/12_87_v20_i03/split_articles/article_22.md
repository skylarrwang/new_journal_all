According to George Appleby, "This community is not supportive of AIDS Project 
New H aven, or of AIDS education in general."

patrol the same territory. 
AIDS educators must also fight ig-
norance, fear, and a lack of public sup-
port in the New Haven community as 
a whole. H omophobia and mistrust of 
anything associated with the word 
AIDS has plagued the fight against ig-
norance. "By being an AIDS worker 
you share the pariah status of the peo-
ple you work with," Appleby said. His 
volunteers have faced anger and bad-
gering from audiences while lecturing, 
as well as conflict with family members 
and friends. "This community is not 
supportive of AIDS Project New 
H aven, or of AIDS education 
in 
general," Appleby said. APNH even 
met with resistance from 
th~ state 
when they tried to put AIDS posters on 
buses. "DON'T PASS THE SPIKE-
USE CONDOMS," the ad reads. Ac-
cording to Appleby, APNH fought 
with 
the State Commissioner of 
Transportation and the State Depart-
ment of Health for six months before 
going to the Qivil Liberties Union with 
their case. "It was because the ads 
would be offensive. The word 'con-
dom' was a red flag," Appleby said. 
The state eventually gave in.

outreach workers appear as outsiders 
to the city's IVD-abusing population, 
who are mostly black and Hispanic. 
To ·fight AIDS in minority com-
munities, outreach requires initiative 
from within those populations. While 
the city's Hispanic community has 
organized itself to combat AIDS, 
Bryant is frustrated with the slow pace 
of action being taken by black com-
munity leaders. New Haven's black 
population accounts for almost 60 per-
cent of the city's AIDS cases, but re-
mains cut off from educational cam· 
paigns. Bryant would like to see black 
civic leaders who have access to those 
communities take the responsibility for 
educating them. "Black ministers, city 
and community leaders have got to 
stop turning their heads because they 
think it is not a problem for them. It is, 
and we cannot continue to ignore it." 
Bryant said that the Hispanic com· 
munity in New Haven has risen to the 
needs of its population, who require 
bilingual education, information, and 
counseling. 


Hispanos Unidos Contra SIDA 
began last June when 30 members of 
New Haven's Hispanic community 
gathered to discuss the AIDS problem. 
"Everyone made a comm;tment to ' 
work," said Maldonado, a founding 
member of Hispanos Unidos. After 
drafting a work plan in October, 
Hispanos Unidos incorporated their 
board of directors. Since then they 
have created two bilingual pamphlets 
on AIDS prevention-one put to· 
gether by IVD abusers for IVD 
abusers, and one for the general 
public. They have started support 
groups 
for 
patients and 
family 
members and will soon begin to con-
duct outreach work of their own. 
Hispanos Unidos is an exception. 
AIDS activists in New Haven would 
like to see more initiative of this sort, 
but a largely disinterested community 
combines with a lack of funding to 
hamper such efforts. Ironically, while 
APNH focuses on the IVD-abusing 
population, it receives most of its fund-
ing from New Haven's gay population, 
according to Appleby. APNH gets no 
money from the city and received only 
$7,000 total from the state. But it is 
slated to receive another $37,000 from 
the state to hire a full-time director, 
who will spend time applying for 
grants.

formed independently and have sur-
vived independently. They owe their 
existence to concerned volunteers ·and 
financial donors. Both groups and the 
Mayor's Task Force would like to :see 
the state government take a 
~ore 
responsible role in fighting AIDS, 
which poses a large threat statewide. 
Connecticut ranks seventh in the na-
tion for incidence of AIDS, and the 
State Department !Jf Health Services 
contends that it is actively moving 
against the disease. Their solution, 
however, is one which New H aven 
AIDS workers believe wastes time and 
money and ultimately hinders their 
own efforts. 

In August the Department of H ealth 
Services contracted with Expand, a 
Maryland-based consulting firm, to 
study the statewide needs for com-
bating the sp':ead of AIDS. In Jan-
uary, Expand will present to the state a 
"conceptual framework paper" with 
suggestions for planning and develop-
ing AIDS education and counseling. 
That paper cost $185,000, and the 
state has agreed to finance whatever 
program Expand suggests - another 
$400,000 to $500,000. 
"I don't think most people in New 
Haven think that's a wise use of 
funds," said Sher . Horosko, coor-
dinator for the Mayor's Task Force on 
AIDS. "Why would you bring in a con-
sulting firm from Maryland to look at 
this 
problem, 
instead of funding 
organizations that are already working 
locally, and struggling? It makes no 
sense to us." The Mayor's Task Force 
advised Mayor DiLieto who, with other 
community leaders, wrote a strong let-
ter of protest to the State Commis-
sioner of Health opposing the project. 
Protestors marched in front of the 
H ealth Department in H artford, but 
the contract was still signed. According 
to Dr. Sheryl Henderson, state coor-
dinator for Expand, the group is still 
assessing Connecticut's AIDS educa-
tion needs and has not yet made any 
specific recommendations. 
Horosko, Appleby, and others 
feared that Expand would attempt to 
set up its own services in New Haven, 
which would split available resources. 
The heads of all three New Haven or-
ganizations met with Henderson last 
month and were assured that no ser-
vice duplications would take place. 
However, Expand's role in fighting 
AIDS statewide and in New Haven re-
mains unclear. "In the meantime, 
we're doing it," Appleby said. "They'll 
go through a period of planning and 
assessment. We've already done that." 
As it is, Connecticut's efforts lag far 
behind those of other states' social, 
medical, and outreach services. New 
Haven already contains over 50 per-
cent of the state's AIDS population, 
and some AIDS workers fear that the 
city could become a magnet, drawing 
AIDS patients from throughout the 
state. San Francisco, because of its
