Feminists could have 
differing opinions on 
prostitution, pomo-
graphy, or the ERA, 
but not on abortion. 
women," the women recognized the 
strength feminism gathers from a 
multiplicity of class, cultural, and 
racial experiences. Did they turn away 
from this recognition in excluding 
Students for Life? 
I soon realized that my first answer 
to this question, a simple "yes," proved 
too easy and ignored many d imensions 
of the decision. There was much more 
at stake in this instance than an 
opportunity to enhance the Center's 
diversity. Incorporating these women 
could undermine the Center's political 
orientation and its ability to work for 
certain political beliefs. In denying 
entry to Students for Life, the Center 
affirmed a specific political agenda 
which they d id not want compromised. 
In effect, they rejected the obligation to 
represent all women when some of 
them held views in basic contradiction 
to the Center's commitment to 
feminism. 

For every belief there exists Â· an 
opposing belief. If I choose to fight on 
one side, I must consider the other 
side, attempt to understand it, and 
even respect it as an alternative. But I 
still remain committed to fighting 
against 
it. There is a 
precarious 
balance to fmd between accommodation 
and focused pursuit. Too often society 
has expected women's political efforts 
to strike that balance on the side of 
accommodation . 

I respect the women of the Center 
for claim ing their political nature 
outright, and even more, for claiming 
~e right to fight for their political 
mterests. T hese interests, no longer 
synonymous at Yale with the word 
"feminism," have found opposition in 
Students for Life. The women of this 
group vehemently insist that they are 
feminists; 
they deny an y ties to 
national pro-life groups, except one 
entitled Feminists for Life. As an 
organization, they do not claim that 
abortion 
should be illegal. Their 
objectives include exploring 
the 
morality of abortion, exposing the 
potential harms which accompany the 
procedure, a nd 
advocating fu ll 
consideration of the alternatives. 

But as individuals, their objectives 
differ from the organization's rhetoric. 
When questioned, members of Stu-
dents for Life express the belief that 
abortion should be illegal except in 
rare cases. G iven their strong personal 
views, I question their honesty in 
refusing to take an offical stand on the 
legality issue. More important, I lose 
respect for them as a women's group 
because they fail to back up their 
personal views with 
a 
political 
statement. 

In the case of abortion, women 
cannot separate the personal from the 
political. Ultimately, these women 
threaten my right to abortion, and that 
threat touches a raw emotional chord 
within me concerning right and 
wrong. Every struggle for human 
rights begins with this instinct for what 
a human being deserves. I must reject 
the intellectual arguments of these 
women because of the same instinct 
which 
supports my pro-choice 
beliefs- the feeling that each human 
being has the fundamental right to 
control her own body. 

In the end, women at Yale lost 
control of their own Center, as Dean 
Sidney Altman decided that 
all 
women's groups, specificaJiy Students 
for Life, must have a place there. 
Altman's command made the women's 
attempts to work out their own 
arrangement seem beside the point. 
But quite the opposite is true. The 
conflict at Yale represents important 
changes 
m 
the broader women's 
movement. "Feminism" no longer 
connotes a single political ideology, 
and women's groups cannot assume a 
common purpose with aJI who call 
themselves feminist. One sign of the 
movement's development is this new 
level of political dissension within its 
ranks. Women must go beyond old 
definitions of feminism to identify 
political ideas which promote their best 
interests.
