do then, although they both insist that 
Health Services will continue to provide coverage for AIDS treatment. 
DeBernardo's characteristic brevity 
dissolves when he discusses the Health 
Services' need to keep all options open 
in dealing with AIDS. He plans to 
recommend reevaluation of the UHS 
policy on a yearly or semi-yearly basis, 
noting that more anonymous testing 
may eventually prove desirable. Then 
again, he says, a time may come when 
HIV positivity does not bear the 
stigma, or create the fear, that it does 
now. "Maybe we can get more civilized 
and the information can just go in the 
regular medical record," he says. 
Providers are to treat 
all patients as if they 
are infected. 
For now, other Yale administrators 
concentrate on short-term responses to 
AIDS while slowly building a permanent apparatus to deal with larger problems in the future. University officials 
obviously fear 
the changing 
dimensions of the disease will throw 
their 
most 
careful 
planning off 
balance, so they wait and evaluate 
every step. They seem to hope that 
they will be spared a sudden spurt of 
cases until they are ready to handle 
them financially, legally, and emotionally. Yale chose to lease the condom machines for one year instead of 
the two years suggested by the vendors 
"to see how they would work out," 
Rowe says. But while the University 
hesitates and examines its options, the 
threat of AIDS continues to grow.
