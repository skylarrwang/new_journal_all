Measuring Up 
Sung Kwak straightened the tie of h is 
tuxedo and took a last glance in the 
mirror. It was concert night for the 
New 
H aven Symphony Orchestra 
(NHSO), and in 15 minutes Kwak 
would lead the orchestra's 85 musicians 
through a program of Mozart, Men-
delsohn, 
and 
Tchaikovsky. 
Kwak 
moved about backstage with a conduc-
tor's composure. Would the concert go 
all right? H e flashed a quick smile. "I 
hope so." 

Kwak was the first of five finalists 
competing to succeed Murry Sidlin, 
music director of the NHSO for the 
past 11 years. According to violist 
Marvin Warshaw, the NHSO became 
a "more respectable orchestra" under 
Sidlin's guidance. Richard Lightfoot, 
chairman of the search committee 
which will select Sidlin's replacement 
next May, claimed that "Murry built 
the orchestra." The N HSO hopes to 
find someone who will follow Sidlin's 
lead. 

When the N H SO announced their 
search for a new director in 1986, they 
received over 275 applications from 
across the nation. The search commit-
tee, 
which 
includes 
three board 
members, two musicians, and the or-
chestra's general manager, rejected 
about half of the candidates, citing in-
adequate credentials. The search com-
mittee requested recordings from 50 
applicants and eventually proposed 
five finalists after more than a year of 
biweekly meetings. 

The NHSO chose applicants "in the 
ascendant portion of their career," 
Lightfoot said. He pointed out that 
New Haven has a reputation for being 
an "arts-intensive community" and that 
the new director must consequently 
show a great deal of artistic leadership. 

Kwak, the current music director of 
the Austin Symphony Orchestra and a 
former 
conductor 
for 
the J offrey 
Ballet, seems to have the necessary 
credentials on paper. But Lightfoot 
stressed that a resume does not stand 
alone. "We have a sophisticated au-
dience and a reputation for adven-
turous programming," he said. "We 
can't have someone who is archival." 

Paul Kantor, one of the two musi-
cians on the · search committee, said 
that the orchestr'i members also want 
an exciting leader- someone "inspired 
and inspiring." Kantor pointed out 
that the selection process, in which 
musicians and management work to-
gether, differs from that of many or-
chestras. ''Here," he said, "the board 
members have been very open to the 
musicians' comments. They really 
have listened to what we have to say." 

The musicians have a chance to get 
to know each finalist during a week of 
meetings and social events. Kwak, 
who visited New H aven in October, 
also 
met with NHSO fundraising 
groups, staff, and volunteers and held 
a press conference for local media. But 
the focal point of Kwak's stay was the 
time he spent with the orchestra-ap-
proximately 13 hours spread over five 
rehearsals. According to Kantor, this 
is a "luxurious amount of time" to 
prepare for a concert. At the end of the 
week, Kwak led the orchestra in front 
of an enthusiastic crowd in Woolsey 
Hall. · 

After the concert, K wak changed 
from his tuxedo into a conservative suit 
and tie. Musicians came to shake his 
hand, and a friend brought roses. 
Asked if it was a good concert, Kwak 
beamed and replied, "It was a good 
week." Four . other conductors now 
stand between h im and his next New 
H aven audience.
