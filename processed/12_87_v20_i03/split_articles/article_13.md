"In modern times we 
usually don't have ex-
temal lions. All of our 
lions are inside of us 
now." 
8 The New Journal/ December 4. 1987 
In Yale's stacks, the wntmg on the 
tables and walls, scribbled in black pen 
and colored markers, speaks of love 
and trouble. "I don't belong here, I am 
too stupid! My professors all hate me!" 
someone has written on one desktop. 
On another: "All I want to do is sleep 
for a few weeks, like my dog at home. 
Is that too much to ask? I won't pee on 
the rug." Basic questions appear: "Why 
me?" and "Is love a media myth?" 
There is also an offering of advice. 
"Music can keep you sane," someone 
writes. "If you screw up on one test or 
paper or even in one whole class your 
life will be far from over." But the graf-
fiti has a limited effect. "I can't keep on 
like this. I have to do something 
NOW," one tabletop reads. "This can 
be a very bad place. Here I am in the 
stacks, last week of school, and- some-
one- a guy- breaks into 
muffled 
sobs two aisles down." 

Humor, advice, longing, and des-
pair surface in a variety of graffiti, but 
they often come from the same source, 
stress. Stress has an effect on both 
physical and emotional well-being, and 
in recent years has received increasing 
attention from the medical field for its 
link to physical illness. In a meeting of 
mind and body, stress management 
formalizes ways to prevent "stressing 
out," a condition with symptoms as 
mild as cold hands and as threatening 
as chest pain. 

The coronary heart disease that such 
pain can signal has become the major 
cause of premature death in the United 
States. The medical establishment has 
responded to this high incidence with 
an increased interest in stress manage-


In modern times we usually don't 
have external lions. All of our lions are 
inside of us now, and we push our but-
tons mentally in response to threats to 
our ego or threats to things that we 
value, but that triggers the same bodily 
response," Roderick Watts, a stress 
management counselor and psycholo-
gist, explains. Dr. Watts, on the 
Medical School faculty, coordinates 
the adult programs at the Consultation 
Center, a clinic near the Yale campus 
that serves the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center, the Department of 
Psychiatry of the School of Medicine, 
and 
Community Consultation 
Board, 
Inc. 
He addresses 
stress 
management in a number of work-
shops 
for business and nonprofit 
groups and teaches its techniques to 
the Yale community during midterms 
and finals. 

From outside Watts' office, 
children's voices fade in and· out, 
signaling activity in the Center's 
special programs. "We are prevention-
oriented in general- anything like 
consultation, education, and training 
designed to prevent mental health pro-
blems before they occur," Watts says. 
For worried students as well as cor-
porate bosses, stress management fits 
within this model and often results in 
lowered health care costs. 

Students attend Watts' seminars 
because they have difficulty coping 
with academic and personal pressure. 
Joa~ Slepian (SOM '93), familiar with 
these problems, has d1scovered how 
stress management addresses students' 
needs. She spent six years as director 
of counseling services for Hartwick 
College 
in 
upstate 
New 
York 
and found stress management an im-
portant part of her work. A trained 
clinician with master's degrees in 
counseling and clinical social work, she 
came- to Hartwick without any formal 
training in stress management. Upon 
witnessing inappropriate student 
responses to stress, such as heavy 
drinking, she recognized the need for a 
healthful alternative. 

"Once you identify the stressor and 
the situation and what is going on you 
can do one of three things. You can 
change yourself, you can change the 
situation, or you can change your
