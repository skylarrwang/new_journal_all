It is Richard's first visit to the Dana-3 
clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital, 
and he has brought his wife and their 
18-month-old baby with him. They sit 
quietly in one of the many examining 
rooms that line the hallway of Dana-3, 
where twice a week the hospital's AIDS 
Care team gathers to meet and evaluate some of the 300 patients they currently treat. Dr. Warren Andiman, 
chief physician at the AIDS Care 
Clinic, has not met Richard before. He 
is a new patient, but Dr. Andiman 
knows the story of Richard and his 
family long before he enters the room. 
Their file tells a story he has seen many 
times. 
A New Haven man in his late twenties, Richard had used drugs since the 
age of 15, mostly heroin and cocaine 
toward the end. Four years ago, Richard got lucky. He enrolled in a 
methadone program to fight his heroin 
abuse, and after two years of treatment

he gave up drugs entirely. He has not 
touched them since. Richard began to 
work regularly, and two-and-a-half 
years ago he married his wife. Soon 
after, they gave birth to a baby boy. 
Last August, when Richard checked 
into a local hospital suffering from extreme weight loss, doctors determined 
that he had a low white blood cell 
count. On the advice of a physician, 
Richard underwent a test for the 
presence of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody in his 
system. The test returned positive. 
Richard was feeling the first symptoms 
of infection with AIDS. 
In September, both his wife and 
child underwent the test for AIDS. 
Both tests came back positive. "All I 
ever expected all the time I was doing 
drugs was hepatitis," Richard tells Dr. 
Andiman. "I didn't even know about 
AIDS. I thought my whole life was 
turning around, doctor." 
None of the family suffers from the 
many opportunistic infections which 
attack a body whose immune system 
has been weakened by the AIDS virus. 
For the time being, they will live normal lives. All Richard can do now is to 
request psychiatric care for the trauma 
the family will face and for the tremendous guilt he feels at having infected 
his wife, who has never touched drugs 
or alcohol, and his child. 
Richard and his family reflect a 
tragic set of circumstances that is 
becoming more prevalent as the AIDS 
epidemic grows in the United States. 
Intravenous drug (IVD) abuse has 
become a major source for the spread 
of the AIDS virus. With it come problems which are unlike those encountered by any other risk group. In 
cities like New Haven-urban centers 
with poor, minority populations- a 
new picture of the AIDS epidemic is 
emerging. Intravenous drug abuse
