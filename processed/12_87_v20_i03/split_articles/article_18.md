the virus, a number at which DeBernardo laughs. The doctor is slower to 
dismiss the words of Michael Chapian, 
the coordinator of ATFAY, who alleges that eight undergraduate and 
graduate students have had 10 leave 
Yale suffering from AIDS, ARC, or 
the stress of HIV positivity, and that 
approximately one dozen students admitted to Yale as freshmen this past 
September knew before entering that 
they were HIV positive. He admits 
that Chapian may have access to information which UHS does not share. 
Rowe denies that Chapian could 
know whether incoming freshmen had 
tested positive for HIV. "The health 
history report that the freshmen get 
does not include any HIV information," he says. Chapian says that he 
learned about the 12 HIV positives 
from a contact at the medical school, 
and that he personally knows "more 
than two" undergraduates who tested 
positive at sites other than UHS. 
Regardless of the number of known 
positives, DeBernardo says that "Those 
who are known HIV positive are only 
the tip of the iceberg." Some students 
may be unwitting carriers. 
Those cases 
that 
UHS 
administrators and providers do know 
about, they treat according to the 
guidelines of the 
University AIDS 
policy. Asymptomatic HIV positives 
will have full access to all University 
activities and facilities, while people 
suffering from AIDS or ARC will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A 
cautionary note precedes these guidelines: "The following policies are based 
on 
the 
current state of medical 
knowledge, which is subject to change 
as new 
information becomes 
available." 
The Health Care plan currently 
covers AIDS treatment, which DeBernardo estimates can run as high as 
$70,000 per year for each patient. If 
UHS is faced with a sudden increase in 
the number of cases covered by its insurance plan, he says, "it's going to be 
a financial burden." Some of this cost 
will be assumed by students, through 
small increases in their Yale medical 
insurance. Rowe says that, for now, 
UHS will rely on its own "stop-loss" insurance, which picks up the costs of 
catastrophic illness for health maintenance organizations after a certain 
point, to prevent students from feeling 
the pinch. Stop-loss insurance is now 
inexpensive, but DeBernardo believes 
it may soon skyrocket in response to 
greater demand. An administrator at 
Yale-New Haven adds that hospitals 
which have attempted to provide insured treatment for AIDS patients 
have begun to go bankrupt. "Work 
that out for yourself," he says. "If the 
Health Plan had to foot the bill for a 
number of patients, it would be difficult to imagine how they would remain solvent, unless the University 
subsidized them." Neither DeBernardo 
nor Rowe can predict what UHS will
