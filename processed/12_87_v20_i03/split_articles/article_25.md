same plague, and one of the few 
cultural muniments to record the 
magnitude of its horror: "all fall down." 
But the Black Death is by no means 
the most disruptive plague on record. 
Most of the Indian population of South 
America died within 50 years of the ar-
rival of Europeans from the plague of 
smallpox the Spanish brought with 
them. Because the conquistadores were 
accustomed (and more immune) to 
smallpox themselves, because they 
neither understood nor cared about the 
Indians dying by the millions, and-
most poignantly, perhaps-because 
the culture which might have recorded 
the revelations of this plague perished 
along with its creators, nothing sur-
vives to share the secrets of the human 
heart which might have been learned 
from what was perhaps the most de-
vastating single pestile'hce iq history. 
Like other plagues, 
the AIDS 
epidemic is both universal and par-
ticular. In the communities most af-
fected by it so far, one sees the classic 
responses to plague. Some find that the 
walls which protected them from death 
and sickness have collapsed, and they 
regard themselves as members of the 
community of the dying even if they 
are apparently healthy. Others -like 
Boccaccio's storytellers- shore up the 
old walls, build new ones, or escape to 
fantasy. 

But in several ways the AIDS epi-
demic and public reaction to it are un-
paralleled. The walls around disease 
and death have been greatly buttressed 
in the twentieth century not only by 
preoccupation in industrial societies 
with the health of the body but also 
with the concept of being "normal"- a 
concept which has replaced "mor al" or 
"good" in politically based, religiously 
plural societies. In moralistic cultures 
everyone is conscious of being a sin-
ner, a fact Â·which mitigates the degree 
of alienation visited upon or felt by 
those who transgress the rules. "Nor-
mality" is a much more alienating con-
cept, since it frequently applies to so-
meone's being rather than to behavior 
which he could alter. Serious illness is 
abnormal in health-obsessed America, 
and few things are as alienating as be-
ing seriously unhealthy. 

This blaming and punishing of vic-
tims for not being "normal" is par-
ticularly devastating in the cases of the 
largest groups of people with AIDS in 
America, gay men and drug addicts. 
Even without fear of contagion, having 
a fatal illness would isolate them from 
American society. When communica-
bility and social stigma are added, the 
rejection, callousness, and indifference 
become overwhelming. It is not too 
difficult to see why, in a society deeply 
troubled by drug abuse on the part of 
political, artistic, and sports elites, the 
public might choose to view heroin ad-
diction as a reprehensible moral choice 
rather than as a pitiful form of suffer-
ing. The circumstances of the poorest 
and most alienated Americans are 
quite different from those of the rich 
and powerful, and one might more 
charitably regard their addiction as a 
desperately wrong choi~e of remedies 
than as a malicious crime, but it is still 
understandable that people entertain 
ambivalence about problems of drug 
abuse. 

It is less easy to understand-
indeed, very hard for me to see-why 
the pathetic, excruciating conse-
quences this often entails are then con-
flated with addicts' bad choices, induc-
ing at best utter indifference to their 
fates and at worst active revulsion and 
hostility. The plight of middle-class 
persons affiicted with lung cancer after 
years of smoking, with heart disease 
after years of being overweight or fail-
ing to exercise, with injuries sustained 
in an automobile accident while intox-
icated, with financial ruin after fiscal 
dishonesty- these prompt compassion 
in most humans, and soften judge-
ments about erstwhile failings. Even if 
we see that in some way their misery is 
related to their previous actions, we 
are reminded that misfortune is as 
common to all of us as are unwise or 
selfish choices. For some reason, the 
unwise choices of poor blacks and His-
panics in America's urban centers 
seem to place them out -of reach of 
compassion or empathy from most 
Americans, including, tragically, the 
government. 

It is as bad for gay men, which is 
more surprising in some ways, because 
they are not usually separated from the 
indifferent majority by emolional, 
social, or physical distance. They come 
from ordinary families of all social 
classes. The wall dividing them from 
the majority is not demarcated by a 
ghetto or a color or economic standing. 
The notion that Western society has 
been characterized by generally in-
creasing progress and tolerance on 
social issues like the position of gay 
people is a misprision. Probably at no 
time and place in Western history have 
attitudes toward gay people been more 
hostile than in the United States and 
Europe throughout most of the twen-
tieth century. This is related to the 
historical vagaries and inconsistencies 
of the transition from moral values to 
pseudo-scientific ones noted above. 

In the ancient world "norms" for 
human beings were largely social and 
behavioral: there was public agree-
ment and expectation about how to be 
a good citizen, a good parent, a good 
child, a good friend, based on codes of 
conduct which anyone could fulftll. 
There was little or no consciousness of 
gay people as a distinct category of 
human being; they could and did fulfill 
these duties as well as anyone else. 
Men known to have erotic interest in 
other men occupied high pos1t1ons, 
were extremely influential and often 
much admired. 

Christianity introduced a different 
set of norms, marginally worse for gay 
people. From about the the fourth cen-
tury of the Christian era to the 
Renaissance, the predominant public 
norm was holiness: a complex concept 
derived from Christian scriptures and 
teaching, social taboos and decorum, 
and personal sentiment. This norm 
could be applied in two ways to gay 
Jleople. They could be viewed as 
"separate but equal"-i.e., bound by 
the same rules of holiness except for 
the variable of gender. A Christian 
ceremony of union for same-gender 
couples perfomed widely in the Early 
Middle Ages, a genre of debates in 
high medieval literature about the 
relative merits of homosexual vs. 
heterosexual love (in which the gay 
side wins two out of three), complaints 
in 
twelfth and thirteenth-century 
literature that gay clerics enjoy special 
advantages- are 
all traces of the 
"separate but equal" approach. 

A second, better-known strand of 
though t opposed homosexual behavior 
categorically. It held that to meet the 
standard of"holiness" a sexual act must 
not only occur within a marriage, but 
also be procreative. This narrower 
view was mostly limited to ascetic 
strains in the 
early church, but 
gradually gained ground in Europe 
from the twelfth to the fourteenth cen-
tury, at a time when many other 
minorities (e.g., Jews) were also incur-
ring greater 
social 
stigma and 
ostracism, and it eventually swept the 
other one before it. By the end of the 
Middle Ages, homosexuality was con-
sidered a serious sin everywhere in 
Europe, and there were penalties for it 
in most civil lawcodes. 

This put gay people in an inferior 
category, but it is crucial to note that it 
was a category everyone else also oc-
cupied at times: what was wrong with 
gay people was that they were sinners, 
but it was "normal" to be a sinner. 
Every human being since the Fall but 
Jesus and the Virgin Mary had been or 
would be a sinner. Even the people 
who promulgated this view of sexuality 
admitted that most conjugal acts per-
formed by most couples did not meet 
its standards; it was, therefore, not so 
disturbing that gay people failed them 
as well. 

It was the modern world that created 
the barriers now isolating gay people 
so effectively. Beginning in the eigh-
teenth century, having for the most 
part lost interest and faith in the 
transcendental values underlying the 
idea of"holiness," European society in-
creasingly replaced it with the concept 
of "normality." And as medicine has 
advanced and the residents of pros-
perous industrialized cultures have 
become more focused on their bodies 
and less interested in non-material 
values, a paramount arena for assess-
ing the "normal" in Western thought 
has come to be "health"- physical and 
psychological.
