Another Course 
Saffron-robed and bald, beating drums 
and crashing cymbals, they color Elm 
Street 
with 
otherworldly designs. 
Yalies with designs for this world only 
turn their heads and scuttle to the 
safety of Cross Campus. The Hare 
Krishnas are in town, and apparently 
they're here to stay. 

The Krishnas, who first appeared in 
New Haven in 1973 and spent two 
months selling books on the Green, 
have returned periodically to conduct 
educational programs at Dwight Hall. 
But according to Acaryadeva, the cur-
rent chairman of the International 
Society for Krishna Consciousness 
(ISKCON) and a visiting lecturer in 
New Haven, "the Krishnas are perma-
nent." 

The principle lure of New Haven is 
Yale. As Acaryadeva explained, the 
Krishnas plan to establish temples in 
academic centers where "some of the 
most intelligent people tend to con-
gregate," and 
to 
cultivate "an 
enlightened class, ideal in its conduct 
and enlightened in spiritual 
knowledge." This enlightened class, 
they hope, will guide America to a 
spiritual awakening. 

Steve Shutt, a Yale history Ph.D. 
candidate 
who 
teaches meditation 
classes in Dwight Hall and is familiar 
with ISKCON, asserted that the pre-
sent group of Krishnas is well-suited to 
Yale. He feels that they use an ap-
proach significantly different from the 
shock tactics and psychological.tinker-
ing commonly associated with the 
Krishnas. Pointing to their knowledge 
of Western and Eastern culture and 
religion, Shutt said that the New 
Haven Krishnas seem very intellec-
tually inclined. 

About 500,000 people have joined 
the Krishna movement in the United 
States since it appeared in New York 
City in 1965. The movement began in 
India 5000 years ago and has gathered 
a large international following. It is

based on extensive literary sources, 
primarily the writings of the Lord Sri 
Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita. Accor-
ding to Acaryadeva, through a strict 
program of chanting, diet, and discus-
sion, Krishna devotees attempt 1'to at-
tain a spiritual knowledge that will 
purify their soul and bring them to a 
higher and expanded consciousness." 

Acaryadeva established a new center 
last May on Park Street to bring this 
opportunity to New Haven and Yale. 
Its doors are open to the inquisitive on 
Thursday evenings for informal 
discussion about reincarnation, 
spirituality, and existentialism over a 
meal of homemade vegetarian pizza 
and pear juice. On Sunday evenings 
the Krishnas hold a more formal pro-
gram of chanting, a lecture and discus-
sion, 
followed 
by 
a 
multi-plate 
vegetarian feast. 

Even though several Yale students 
have attended these sessions, the 
Krishnas have not received the over-
whelming response from them that 
they had hoped for. Dina Diya, a first-
year student in the nursing school's 
nurse-midwifery program and a Krish-
na devotee of 15 years, feels that the 
Krishnas will have a greater influence 
on the community as people become 
more aware of the movement. 

The Krishnas' parade, or "hari 
nama," has introduced many Yale 
students to the group. "That really 
scares people," admitted Sarvatma, an 
Argentinian who left his editorial posi-
tion on a surrealist Uruguayan news-
paper and now runs the Park Street 
center. "Most people respond with 
wilderment, but some brave ones· have 
spoken to us." Acaryadeva added, "We 
have to go out and meet people. We 
have a lot of communicating to do."
