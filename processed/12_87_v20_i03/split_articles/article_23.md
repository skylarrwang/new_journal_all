AIDS
sophisticated AIDS care programs,
became the magnet for California. But
New Haven's services are inadequate
for its own ever-growing AIDS popula-
tion, without confronting an influx of
patients from the rest of Con necticut.
San Franciso developed sophisticated
care programs because the m~ority of
its A IDS population, gay men, has a
strong power base in the city govern-
ment. By comparison, New Haven's
AIDS population has no power base at
all.

The city's IVD abusers must depend
on the efforts of outsiders to combat
the vicious cycle which is slowly con-
suming them. Volunteer groups and
now the city have begun to address the
problem of AIDS and IVD abuse. But
their efforts are dwarfed by the vast
population of minorities and IVD
users whose needs they hope to meet.
The current rift between the state and
New Haven is damaging the cause· of
AIDS education and hurting the AIDS
patients themselves. "My clear impres-
sion is that there is a lack of urgency 6n
the part of state planners," Appleby
said. "The more you delay education
funds, the greater the chance that more
young people are going to be infected
with the virus."

In the meantime people are dying.
Richard and his family are only one
case. The AIDS clinic at Yale-New
Haven hospital has already lost two en-
tire families, 81 people in all. "I think
it's going to get much worse before it
gets better," Bryant said. "Many more
minorities and drug abusers will die
before people begin to pay attention."
Six thousand New Haven residents
may already carry the AIDS virus.
Condoms, bleach, and counseling can
begin to protect the uninfected. But
until outreach receives the support it
needs, the cycles of H IV infection will
continue to turn.
