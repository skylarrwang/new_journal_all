Plagues have held a mirror to the
cultures and peoples they affiict for as
long as literature has recorded the fears
and follies of humans. Writings from
Exodus tO Camus' La Peste have
chronicled the reactions of individuals
and nations to biological catastrophe as
a means of exploring human souls and
behavior. This is partly because the
terrifying effects of plague- sickness
and death- are themselves staples of
both history and literature, being the
chief plot devices nature uses in setting
the length and shape of human lives.
They are at once natural and un-
natural, universal and singular, ab-
solutely predictable and totally un-
nerving, and therefore ideal for both
literature and history, which must
decipher the constants of the human
heart by exploring its reactions to par-
ticular and extraordinary events:
Plague adds another dimension to


the revealing power of sickness and
~eath by transforming an essentially
Individual experience into a communal
one. Long ago, the deceased were "laid
to rest" on family land and thought of
as the members of the family or com-
rnunity who had gone before; in the
lllodern world the dead are all gathered
away from the areas used by the living
and hidden away behind cemetery
Walls. The sick are kept away from the
healthy, often in special buildings for
th_is purpose. These distinctions and
their social embodiments are created
by profound anxieties about sickness
and dying, which in the twentieth cen-
tury have taken on the air of the
bizarre and macabre rather than being
thought of as normal events in the lives
of humans. Medicine and its ameliora-
tion of the frailty of the body have con-
tributed to this, but it is also in large
measure the result of loss of faith in
personal or social values beyond good
health and a pleasant life.

Plague demolishes these barriers
and looses on the living and healthy the
anxieties supposed to be contained
beyond hospital and graveyard walls.
Disease and mortality become com-
munal experiences and worries.
Healthy people must think about
disease, must experience sickness other
than their own, must face and cope
with death. An unusual increase in the
number of sick, especially if related to
a communicable illness, can so terrify
the healthy that they cease to believe in
the distinctions which formerly pro-
tected them. Whole societies can begin
to think of themselves as diseased and
dying, even when the majority are not,
because the horror of plague breaks
through the cultural barriers which
had protected the ordinary person
from seeing the inevitable, or so
disorders the natural plot line for in-
d ividuals that notions of "lifetime" col-
lapse.

The most haunting images of plague
in the Western tradition are those of
the Black Death of 1348-1350, which
killed about one-third of the entire
population of Europe in two years .. Its
effects were so devastating that the
political and religious structures of
Europe were profoundly transformed.
Astonishingly, much literature com-
posed at the time takes little notice;
some of it seems utterly oblivious. The
cynical and ribald tales told in the
Decameron by aristocrats who fled the
plague and sealed themselves off from
a dying world are the best known li-
terary legacy of this. The nursery
rhyme "Ring around the rosey" (a
description of one of the symptoms) is
an incongruously light-hearted re-
minder of a later occurrence of the
