In the late afternoon on Friday, 
October 7, I relinquished my watch to a 
jeweler on Chapel Street. 

I can’t tell you the precise time this 
occurred.

My watch had been ailing for days, 
maybe the better part of two weeks. 
First, it was five minutes behind. Then 
ten. Then forty. Then it stopped. Then 
it would tick again and I’d wind the dial 
so the second and minute hands rested 
at the correct distance from each other. 
Then it would stop, again, but I’d wear 
it anyway, hoping that it would revive 
during the day when it got some sunlight 
and some fresh air and that I’d look 
down when I needed it and the hands 
would be moving again like they were 
supposed to. 

I’d sit down to dinner in the dining 
hall and find myself telling everyone 
about my watch.  
“So, how’s your week?” asked my 
long-unseen friends. “How have you 
been?”  
My fork would clink against my 
plate. I would dig into roasted cauliflower 
or tofu fried rice or pan-seared salmon 
with mango salsa. 
“Good! Good. I need to get my 
watch fixed, though. Every time I look 
down it’s more behind.” 
“Oh, yeah—hm. That must be so 
annoying!” 

You know the phrase, “You are 
what you eat?” Rewrite. You are what 
you say while you eat. My watch was the 
bland, vicissitudinous spoonful I fed my 
suitemates. 

On Tuesday, October 11, after my 
film lecture, I returned to the jeweler on 
Chapel Street. The lecture ends at 2:20 
p.m. It couldn’t have been long after that.

The woman behind the counter 
asked for the ticket they’d given me on 
my first visit. I couldn’t find it in my 
backpack, and all seemed lost.	
But she said I could give her 
my name, which I eagerly did. She 
disappeared into the back, reemerged 
with a crisp, yellow manila envelope, and 
asked to see my identification. Satisfied, 
she unveiled my watch, the band neatly 
coiled. It was pulsing gorgeously. 

I was reunited with my watch at 
2:32 p.m., according to the receipt.
“Would you like to wear it out?” the 
woman asked. 
“Oh yes, I would,” I said. 	
Is knowing the time all the time so 
important? If it is, why did days grow 
into the better part of two weeks before 
I relinquished a time-teller that couldn’t 
tell me the time? I mean before I got it 
diagnosed. Cured. Fixed? 

My watch’s constant tempo gives 
regular rhythm to inconstant days. Its 
band wraps around my wrist and beats 
with a pulse where I can feel my own. 
It’s the living, moving machine I choose 
to wear with me from day’s start to day’s 
end. 

Maybe it took me so long to part 
with my watch because it’s really a small 
part of me. Maybe I had known all 
along that I would miss it. I had been a 
negligent owner, really. Maybe that’s why 
it was the conversational morsel I gave 
others to digest.

Or maybe I need to stop worrying 
about my watch and find something else 
to talk about.
