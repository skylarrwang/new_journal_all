The Clean, Green 
Financing Machine
Gov. Dannel Malloy and the state 
legislature 
overhauled 
Connecticut’s 
energy bureaucracy over the summer. 
They merged the regulatory body for 
utilities and the old environmental 
commission to create a new agency, 
the 
Department 
of 
Energy 
and 
Environmental 
Protection. 
The 
department is headed by Daniel Esty, a 
Yale University professor on leave, and 
is sometimes known by its profound 
acronym, DEEP. Malloy also established 
the Connecticut Clean Energy Finance 
and Investment Authority, which calls 
itself “the nation’s first ‘green bank.’ ” 
As a “quasi-public” agency, it has broad 
legal power not only to award grants, but 
also to make various types of loans and 
to seek investment, like a private bank.


The aim is to leverage public and 
private money to help scientists and 
entrepreneurs in Connecticut develop 
renewable, efficient sources of energy, 
and to encourage the commercialization 
and adoption of new technologies. 
“Financial institutions across the country 
have been in touch with us to try to think 
through opportunities and partnerships. 
Attracting private capital is the main goal 
here,” said David Goldberg, the green 
bank’s director of government and 
external affairs.


It may be too early to tell what 
the new authority’s impact will be, but 
if Goldberg and his colleagues are 
successful, the Leeway-Putnam building 
on Putnam Avenue in Hamden may 
offer a glimpse of what’s to come.


The supportive housing facility for 
patients with HIV and AIDS is a stucco-
sided box with bright blue metal roofing 
on the gables and awnings over the entry. 
It sits across from a vacant lot and next 
to a warehouse and garage where grass 
sprouts through cracks in the asphalt of 
the parking lot. Inside, a vent near the 
floor was quiet on a rainy September 
afternoon. A visitor wouldn’t give the 
dusty grate a second glance.


Yet energy-efficiency technology 
doesn’t always look fancy and futuristic. 
When the building’s vents are whirring, its 
heating and cooling system draws energy 
from the ground through many shallow, 
water-filled wells several feet deep. The 
system is called a geothermal or ground-
source heat pump, and it’s designed to 
meet the building’s heating and cooling 
needs more efficiently. Geothermal 
pumps can save more energy per dollar 
than solar panels, and they’ve been 
around for decades. Reducing fossil fuel 
consumption doesn’t have to mean cold 
fusion generators, acres of solar panels 
gleaming in the sunrise, or faster-than-
light travel. 


Leeway, the New Haven support 
organization for patients with HIV 
and AIDS, opened the 17-unit facility 
in Hamden last fall. The system was 
installed with a $71,000 grant from the 
Finance and Investment Authority’s 
predecessor, which did not offer loans 
to the extent that the new authority will.


“It’s had its quirks just like any other 
system, but I think it’s been working very 
well,” said Rick Ross, who oversaw the 
project for Leeway. “That, along with the 
insulation that was installed there, makes 
it a very energy-efficient building.”
