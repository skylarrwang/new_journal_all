a basic circuit and battery pack, with 
the goal of lighting up a model house. 
To learn about energy and inertia, they 
build cars out of wooden wheels, rubber 
bands, and mousetraps. 

Conducting these programs, the 
staff is dismayed by what they see as a 
lack of creative drive in today’s students. 
According to Sally Hill, the museum’s 
associate director and principal designer, 
teaching to the test has fostered a 
generation that constantly asks, “Is this 
okay? Is this right?”, often to the exclusion 
of more pressing questions. “They’re 
driven by a culture of ‘get it right, get 
an A,’ ” she says. “These are kids who 
take no risks.” These days, the museum’s 
educators no longer show “unelaborated 
models,” as Hill calls them, to classes. All 
examples are decorated, messed-with, 
or otherwise personalized beforehand. 
Unless they’re given this tacit license 
to explore, kids will churn out replicas 
utterly indistinguishable from the model, 
following directions and learning little.

Brown argues that it is more 
important today than ever before that 
students learn through mentorship. 
He was profoundly influenced by his 
mentor, Normand Method, a cabinet-
maker and teacher who Brown says 
would try anything. Method instilled in 
Brown a passionate belief in learning’s 
“liberating function,” freeing doctors 
to become woodworkers, and making 
woodworkers realize that they can attend 
MIT seminars on electricity.

However, there is a dearth of 
mentorship in American classrooms 
today, Brown says, due in part to two 
things: schools which are pressed to 
meet state and federal benchmarks, and 
the monopoly that universities have on 
higher education. Universities dominate 
most young people’s visions of their 
future advancement even if they do not 
learn well in a traditional classroom. As 
a result, many have forgotten to stop to 
ask what they should be. 

“The university system is not much 
different from the housing bubble.” 
Brown claims. “It’s a great mechanism 
to make people borrow money.” Though 
higher education is often valuable, he

says, “It’s a suspicious product for the 
amount of money.” 

Sara Thomas, an educator at the 
museum, agrees. An art teacher at a 
magnet school for eight years, she grew 
frustrated with a system that conveyed 
her students to colleges that they couldn’t 
afford. Wishing to be able simply to 
teach kids skills again, she joined the 
staff of the museum several weeks ago. 

Brown and Thomas insist that 
there must be some way for young 
people to seek out meaningful learning 
experiences after high school, outside of 
two and four-year colleges: journeymen’s 
programs, for instance, or engineering 
internships. In our first email exchange, 
Brown asked, “You don’t get into Yale 
without 
a 
bookish 
predisposition. 
But what if you had wanted to be an 
electrician? Are there schools for deep 
thinking electricians?  Are there schools 
that offer electricians a cultural/social 
experience equivalent to that part of 
your experience [at] Yale?” Is it possible, 
he asks, to have an Ivy League for auto 
mechanics?

This unique educational perspective 
is refreshing, but also somewhat 
alienating to visitors. The Eli Whitney 
staff members often refer to people 
as “outsiders,” though their tone 
is surprisingly free of judgment or 
suspicion. The usage seems protectively 
insular, as though the staff members 
feel they must defend their pursuit 
of an educational model that has 
been declared obsolete in America. 
Hill, catching herself using the word, 
explains, “It’s hard. We’re not typical 
in any way.” When pressed as to why, 
Karen Lenahan, the museum manager 
laughs, “Have you seen our office?” 
According to Lenahan, the museum 
has adjusted to the recession by working 
harder to book programs at schools, 
though their contribution lines have 
remained steady. Such community loyalty 
has sustained this small organization 
despite a humble and unfashionable 
mission, and will continue to do so 
during times of fiscal hardship.

In fact, while businesses and nonprofits 
alike are trimming down wherever 
possible, the Eli Whitney Museum and 
Workshop has plans for growth. They 
have begun to raise funds for a $200,000 
project: a 1,000-square foot expansion 
of the Design and Development 
Workshop to house a new computer 
numerical control robot alongside the 
one that was purchased three years ago. 
The CNC can scan a design to fabricate 
three-dimensional objects. The museum 
staff usually refers to it as “the Robot” 
in their pamphlets, or, conversationally, 
as “the Machine.”

Hill jokes that the museum divides 
its history into two periods, pre-
Machine and post-Machine. Where an 
apprentice would once be tasked with 
drilling holes into hundreds of strips 
of wood, that job is now dispatched by 
the Machine with greater precision and 
speed. As a result, staple projects have 
been sharpened, made more beautiful, 
their constituent parts now fitting 
together more smoothly. The Machine 
also can produce prototypes practically 
on demand, enabling iterations of 
new projects that can be refined more 
quickly. More importantly, Hill says, 
it has expanded their sense of what is 
possible for their designs.

The specter of automation does not 
worry Hill. The Eli Whitney Museum 
and Workshop is far from eliminating 
the human element from their work, 
and even farther from devaluing the 
process of learning by doing. In order 
to design well with the robot, you first 
have to play with materials by hand. As 
apprentices advance, delegating tedious 
tasks can only improve their educational 
experience, allowing them to invest 
more time and energy in design and 
invention. To that effect, the museum 
has created the Norm Method Design 
Internship, a semester-long workshop 
intended to help the apprentices build a 
portfolio, a single concession to a world 
that demands résumés.

When Eli Whitney once said 
that his factory was producing 
armorers as well as arms, he meant it 
regretfully. His goal had been to phase 
out skilled labor in favor of simple, 
reproducible motions not subject to 
human variance.  This industrial ethos, 
which used workers as interchangeable 
and replaceable bits, would not be fully 
developed until over a century after he 
established his firearms factory in 1798. 
Today, the museum that bears his name 
takes as its mission the continuation of 
the historical moment that Whitney was 
impatient to move beyond: when the 
energy of innovation and the zest of 
enterprise were balanced by production 
on a human scale, when there was dignity 
and craft in manufacturing. “We are not 
naïve,” reads the museum’s fund-raising 
literature. “We don’t forsee, or need, the 
steadily growing markets we enjoyed for 
the last ten years...We want to save—as 
only a computer can—the intricate and 
nuanced dimensions of our designs.”

Construction on the new building 
has already begun; as of mid-September, 
a space had been cleared, and in the 
intervening week between my visits, the 
first framed wall was erected. Gleaming 
with the paleness of new wood, the site 
resembled Munson’s landscape more 
closely today than ever before.
