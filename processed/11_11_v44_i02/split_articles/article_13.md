              POINTS OF DEPARTURE
Katharine Knoietzko
Mark Simon, a founding partner of 
Centerbrook Architects in Centerbrook, 
Connecticut, is especially familiar with 
geothermal systems. He helped draw the 
plans for Kroon Hall, Yale University’s 
$33.5 million experiment in efficient 
building design, which uses four 1,500-
foot wells for geothermal heating and 
cooling. When I spoke to Simon, he 
was preparing to catch a flight to Ohio, 
where his firm is designing a system for a 
boys’ high school in a Cleveland suburb.


Soil and water belowground are 
insulated from seasonal temperature 
changes, and the pumps use the planet’s 
body heat to keep buildings comfortable 
inside. Ten feet down, the temperature 
in most places stays around fifty-five 
degrees Fahrenheit all year, Simon said. 
In the winter, the warmth that the soil 
groundwater 
absorbed 
during 
the summer can heat buildings. In the 
summer, water that is the temperature of 
the soil can be used to cool them down. 
Geothermal 
heat 
pumps 
are 
inexpensive 
don’t 
require 
sophisticated technology. They will 
typically pay for the cost of installation 
in five to ten years. Still, a geothermal 
heat pump can be very difficult to design. 
“There are a lot of tricky technical issues 
that need attention. Some things aren’t 
going to work the way you want them 
to,” Simon said.


The engineer designing a heat 
pump needs to consider what’s in the 
soil—mud, sand, rock, gravel, clay—as 
well as how much groundwater there is 
and whether changing seasons will affect 
the water table. The amount of heat the 
ground can absorb depends on all of 
these factors. The climate of the region 
matters as well, since when a geothermal 
pump heats groundwater and soil, they 
stay warm for a surprisingly long time. 
In a climate with hot summers and mild 
winters, Simon explained, “the ground 
over time will slowly get warmer and 
warmer.” Yet the pumps work well in 
a state such as Connecticut, with warm 
summers and cold winters.


Funding geothermal heating and 
cooling systems is only a small part of the 
new green bank’s mission. The agency 
also plans to add enough solar panels 
to Connecticut homes to generate thirty 
megawatts of electricity, and Goldberg 
said the agency’s staff expects to exceed 
that goal. Another ambition is producing 
methane, which can power electrical 
generators, by feeding agricultural waste 
to bacteria on a large scale.


Goldberg 
emphasized, 
though, 
that choosing particular technologies 
or industries to support isn’t his 
agency’s goal. It’s a familiar criticism 
of government efforts to support 
entrepreneurship. “The state didn’t 
pick a winning technology,” he said. 
“We’re going to say, ‘We got a pot of 
money, we’re looking for the lowest 
cost, ultimately, to the ratepayer.’ ” If 
the Leeway-Putnam building is any 
indication, the cheapest, most effective 
technologies in Connecticut’s clean-
energy future may be old ones that look 
surprisingly familiar.
