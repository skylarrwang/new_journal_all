“When you saw bull riding, maybe 
you thought there’d be cowboys in town 
who walk like this,” he told us, slouching 
and bowing his legs out, “sit on the 
fence, and say, ‘Yee-haw!’ ” If so, we 
were mistaken. “We’d like to have a little 
fun—play some tunes, do a little dance, 
make a little love, get down tonight!”
If anyone were to shout “Yee-haw!” 
I would have expected it to be McCoy. 
When it comes to cowboys, the 31-year-
old rider from Tupelo, Oklahoma is the 
genuine article. He rode his first calf 
when he was 5. I asked him how to tell 
a real cowboy from a city slicker who’d 
just dressed up for the show. “The thing 
is, the bulls don’t care what you wear. 
You could ride one like that,” he said, 
indicating my necktie.


That night, McCoy and his three 
roommates sat down in a Denny’s to 
talk about the bulls they’d drawn for the 
next day, figurin’ how best to ride ’em. 
McCoy would be on an animal named 
Flashpoint. “He looks like a really good 
draw. He’s honest; he has no tricks,” 
McCoy told me. Then they headed back 
to their room at the Hartford Marriott 
for a good night’s sleep.


T
he bulls, meanwhile, were spending 
the night at Crowley’s Stables, 
just over the state line in Agawam, 
Massachusetts. “We’re staying at the 
Hotel Marriott because we couldn’t get 
into Crowley’s Stables,” Carnefix said. 
You could tell it was a joke he’d used 
many times, but it was still funny.


I drove up to Agawam the next 
day after lunch to meet Jeff Robinson, 
the stock contractor. (“It’s a hot item, 
bull semen,” McCoy said, adding that 
Robinson is “the producer of the year. 
He’s kind of cornered the market, if 
you know what I mean. He’s got it 
cornered, or froze. He’s got the market 
froze.”) After having heard a rumor or 
two, I wanted to hear the true story of 
how Robinson’s bull Chicken on a Chain 
got his name. Chicken on a Chain is a 
popular animal who has been bucking 
riders since 2005, even though the career 
of a typical bull lasts only two years 
before he is put out to stud. Chicken 
on a Chain has just over 3,700 fans on 
Facebook, and Robinson told me he 
receives a couple dozen emails a week 
asking about him.


Robinson, 
with 
his 
deadpan 
cowboy sarcasm, has a keen appreciation 
for the ironies of what was originally a 
predominantly rural sport. “We don’t 
fight chickens or dogs where I’m from,” 
he told me. He is also the kind of stock 
contractor who enjoys messing with 
you. For example, after I told him I 
was a Yale student, he convinced me, 
briefly, that Rasmussen was a Harvard 
alumnus. More than one reporter asked 
Robinson over the weekend how many 
bulls he owned. “Oh, several,” he’d say. 
(Robinson operates three trucks that 
carry around a hundred bucking bulls to 
events around the country, and there are 
more animals at his ranch in Mars Hill, 
North Carolina.)


At Crowley’s Stables, Carnefix and 
I had been joking about my prospects 
as a bull rider. “We got some guys that 
will teach you. You’re not too young 
to learn,” Carnefix had said. Carnefix 
mentioned this post-graduate plan to 
Robinson. “You’re the right size,” he 
told me.


I asked Robinson what a good size 
for a bull rider is. (I am 5-foot-9.)
“ ’Bout your size,” he said.


We stood around watching the 
bulls leave their temporary pens and 
trot up into the trailers in which they’d 
ride down to Hartford. Eventually, I 
asked Robinson about Chicken on a 
Chain. He’d bought the bull on a farm 
somewhere in north Georgia.
“It was kind of creepy,” Robinson 
began. “It was a junky, junky set-up.” A 
boy about ten years old met him. “His 
teeth were all rotten, and he looked 
he was on meth. He said, ‘Hey mister! 
You come to get this motherfucker?’” 
Robinson looked at the bull, a huge 
animal even by bovine standards. “He’s 
the meanest Goddamn bitch you ever 
seen,” the boy said, “and his name’s 
Chicken on a Chain.” Robinson asked 
for an explanation, and the boy obliged, 
continuing in the same vein. “That 
cocksucker got into my daddy’s fightin’ 
roosters,” the boy began, indicating a 
hillside behind him, where Robinson 
saw a number of roosters tethered on 
short chains. Apparently the bull had got 
a prize cock’s chain tangled in his hind 
feet and drug the animal around the 
farm, and that was how he got his name.
“That’s the last time I been to north 
Georgia,” concluded Robinson. Turns 
out some folks are too redneck even for 
the country’s biggest producer of bull 
semen. 


I made no effort to determine 
whether Robinson’s story was true.


ickets for two decent seats for 
the weekend came to six hundred 
dollars, but money was no object for the 
devoted bull riding fans of New England 
and New York. Georgina Vitarius, 
the organizer of the Professional Bull 
Riders Bronx Fan Club, led a group of 
about ten fans to Hartford. The Bronx 
group is “mostly single women, sitting in 
their rooms screaming,” she said. “This 
way, you can scream together. You don’t 
feel so alone.”


Vitarius met Cori Bielecki in 
Hartford, and by Sunday, the two had 
become fast friends. Bielecki, a lissom 
31-year-old horsewoman and vegetable 
farmer from Nantucket, is one of the 
riders’ favorite fans. She spends a lot of 
time with them during the tour, and had 
run an errand to Walmart that morning 
to pick up a couple of tanks of propane 
for the show’s opening pyrotechnics. 
Her cowboy boots are covered with the 
riders’ autographs.
“They were drunk as skunks last 
night,” she told me. She’d been out with 
them until 5 a.m. as the cowboys drank, 
flirted, and ordered pizzas. “The girls are 
flocking… They’re just living the little 
rock-star lives that they’ve built for their 
little bull-buckin’ selves,” she said. 
(McCoy, who wears his wedding ring 
when he rides, was not among the group. 
“I like to think that most of the guys are 
here for business,” he told me. If that’s 
not always true of the Americans, it is of 
the Brazilians. “One word—dedication,” 
McCoy said when I asked him about 
their rides this year. “They come a long 
ways with one goal in mind.” Many of 
the Brazilian riders send their winnings 
home to families who can’t support 
themselves otherwise.)


The fact that the riders spend time 
with their fans—at the very least, to sign 
autographs, take photos, and shoot the 
breeze through the fence after a night 
of bull riding—is an important part of 
bull riding’s appeal. “That’s what makes 
this sport great,” said Chuck McCoy, an 
appliance repairman from Bridgeport, 
New York, who isn’t related to the rider. 
As bull riding grows more popular, 
though, it’s inevitably losing some of its 
intimacy.


Chuck McCoy came for the weekend 
with his wife Doreen, who has an album 
filled with autographed photos of 
herself with bull riders, and they would 
be traveling to Las Vegas at the end of 
the month for the championships.


The McCoys have been bull riding 
fans for about eight years. When the 
tour came to Mohegan Sun last year, the 
bullfighters, who are officially the Dickies 
DuraBullFighters and who are also Built 
Ford Tough, were sent to a hardware 
store in the small town of Colchester, 
Connecticut to meet fans and advertise 
Dickies jeans. Even though Colchester 
is half an hour away from the casino in 
Uncasville, the McCoys followed them.
“No one knew who they were,” 
Chuck said. “People were going in there, 
buying garden supplies, their pet food. 
Nobody was there.” Doreen wrote a 
letter to Dickies, letting them know the 
McCoys felt the company had gone too 
far. Everyone involved in bull riding is 
expected to be accessible to their fans.


The McCoys weren’t the only ones 
nervous about the sport’s future. “It’s 
going to get further and further away 
from the fan-rider relationship,” said 
Pete Archibald, a retired well-driller 
from Lyndeborough, New Hampshire. 
“It’ll be like NASCAR, where you can’t 
even get near them.”


The 
comparison 
between 
the 
Professional Bull Riders and the National 
Association of Stock Car Auto Racing is 
often drawn in the press, and Carnefix 
himself 
had 
mentioned 
NASCAR 
earlier in the weekend. Though the 
sport is now receiving more airtime, not 
too long ago, sports shows’ highlight 
sequences only included wrecks and 
drivers with comical names. In the same 
way, Carnefix explained, sports shows 
feature bull riding only when a bull picks 
up a rider on his horns and tosses him, 
especially if the rider has a name like 
Ryan Dirteater.


I asked Murray if he thought that 
bull riding could continue to expand 
without straining the riders’ relationships 
to their fans. “I think it’s tough. I think 
it’s a balancing act,” he answered. The 
former world champion keeps his own 
personal cell phone number private. 
“People are looking back to when there 
were fifty people that wanted to meet 
the guy. Now there are fifty thousand 
that want to meet the guy. It just gets 
harder.” But, he concluded, “We’re still 
far and away the most fan-friendly and 
accessible sport.”


That may be true, and the bull 
riders’ fans will remain wildly loyal no 
matter what. It’s also true that bull ridin’ 
jus’ ain’t what it used to be. “Years ago, 
we were one big family,” Chuck McCoy 
told me. “Now, you have to kiss ass and 
get down in the dirt just to talk to the 
real cowboys.”


S
aturday night, the riders gathered 
in a concrete-floored room of the 
Civic Center basement, big enough to 
drive a truck through, to draft their bulls 
for the third and final day of riding. At 
traditional rodeos, the riders draw their 
bulls out of a hat, but the Professional 
Bull Riders introduced the draft to add 
an element of strategy to the sport.


The cowboys sat around several 
small round tables with computer 
printouts and markers. The Brazilians 
had a table in the corner.
“Dirteater couldn’t get out on him,” 
I heard one cowboy saying to another.
“Dirteater couldn’t, but you could 
get out on him,” the other said.
“I’m not even gonna try.”


Fabiano Vieira, a rookie from Brazil, 
was the only rider to have qualified on all 
three bulls he’d ridden in the first two 
days of the tournament. He had the 
first pick, and he chose a bull named 
Hannibal.


Tight Rope was the next bull, Luke 
Snyder’s pick.


Then Slim To None, Exotic Justin, 
Tornado Alley.
“L.J., which one? Did you say 
Tornado Alley?”


Flashpoint had bucked off Cord 
McCoy that night, and another rider 
picked the bull McCoy had hoped to 
ride the next day. McCoy chose Real 
Legit on the advice of the guys who 
happened to be standing next to him at 
the time. “You shoot from the hip,” he 
said. He wouldn’t ride Real Legit either, 
and would finish the weekend with only 
four hundred dollars.


Vieira, on the other hand, would ride 
Hannibal the next day and another bull 
named Who Dat in the championship 
round to win the tournament. He’d had 
a perfect weekend, and left Hartford 
with just under forty thousand dollars.


I wasn’t going to leave the 
tournament with a check, nor were any 
of the other fans merging onto Interstate 
91 that afternoon. I was lucky, though, 
to have talked to the real cowboys.
