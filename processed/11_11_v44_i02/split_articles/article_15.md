May 15 movement of los indignados, the 
indignant, who sat down in the plaza 
that serves as the beating heart of Spain’s 
capital and decided they weren’t going to 
move until they felt less indignant.


But then, I thought I was witnessing 
a European phenomenon. I couldn’t 
imagine a similar group of Americans 
protesting against nothing in particular 
and for nothing specifically in a manner 
that violated all manner of municipal 
regulations. In Spain, even the president 
merely shrugged his shoulders and 
said he understood the protesters’ ire 
and that evicting them would cause 
more problems that it would solve. In 
America, I reckoned, protests became 
weird sometime between the ’70s and 
last fall’s Rally to Restore Sanity in 
Washington, D.C., where I and a quarter 
of a million other people all made fun of 
the idea of protesting.


Unemployment in Spain pushes 
20 percent, and among young people 
it’s over 40 percent. Neither of the 
nation’s two biggest political parties has 
any idea what to do. Politicians in major 
cities, such as Valencian Community 
president Francisco Camps, have been 
indicted in corruption scandals and 
gone unpunished. Short of Franco’s 
grandchildren, who wouldn’t be taking 
the streets? But it’s a Spanish thing. 
Right?


Spaniards 
in 
all 
major 
cities 
protested against the political and 
economic system. They began in 
May a week before national elections. 
They didn’t vote. They camped there 
all summer, beginning to disband in 
June but not actually leaving until the 
beginning of August, when the police 
finally retook the plaza. They tried to 
come back, but the police blocked the 
streets, so the protestors all went back 
inside to find some air conditioning. 


As I strolled through Occupy 
Wall Street last month, I tried to figure 
out what the protestors wanted. One 
man’s sign listed the ratios of average 
CEO salary to average worker’s salary 
in Britain, Japan, and the United States. 
Twelve to one. Fifteen to one. Four 
hundred and twenty-two to one. Yikes. 


I found myself helping out with 
what the protestors call the “people’s 
voice.” Someone starts talking. People 
nearby repeat the words loudly so 
that a large circle of people can hear 
the speech. (The New York Police 
Department has prohibited megaphones 
and other noisemaking devices.) A 
woman gave a speech on behalf of 
an organization she called the New 
York Society of A-G-L-B-F-I-O-Z 
or something like that. (It got a little 
muddled in the process of repeating.) 
Then she began to tell us the economic 
story of our young lifetimes: “Since the 
early ’90s (‘since the early ’90s’), average 
worker salaries have remained constant, 
but the super rich keep getting richer.” 
More people repeated her words. “In 
the financial collapse, (‘in the financial 
collapse’) ordinary Americans lost their 
jobs and their homes, but Wall Street 
kept on profiting.” Loud and clear. 


I walked to Washington Square Park, 
where another protest was underway. It 
may have been true that every corner 
on Broadway, the street in America 
with the most overbearing corporate 
advertisements, was just as crowded as 
Zuccotti Park, but Washington Square 
was lively. New York University students 
and young people surrounded the central 
pond and repeated each other’s speeches. 
TV cameras surrounded a pretty, well-
dressed college-age girl as she explained 
her sign listing concrete demands for 
the movement. Another man waved 
a stake topped by the impaled effigy 
head of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd 
Blankfein bloodily gaping at us. Most 
people seemed to recognize Blankfein. 
So there’s another concrete demand.


Why Washington Square Park? 
Well, the movement spread. Everyone 
wanted to take part. As we listened to 
a speech by environmental activist Bill 
McKibben railing against oil pipelines 
and government secrecy, a group of 
kids wearing tie-dyed T-shirts held signs 
saying “Christians for Occupy Wall 
Street” and “Who would Jesus foreclose 
on?” By October 15, when people all over 
the United States and the world marched 
in solidarity with OWS, there were 
protests in my hometown of Atlanta, in 
London, England and Lubbock, Texas; 
in Cape Town and Mumbai and Seoul; 
in socialist-equality paradise Stockholm, 
in multiple buroughs of New York City. 
Oh, and fifty thousand indignados retook 
Puerta del Sol. 


The hardcore people camping on 
the cold New York concrete have started 
something, and I don’t mind if a lot of 
them are weird. It’s about time someone 
stood up and said it: the economy could 
be fairer. I’m orgulloso—that’s “proud”— 
of my country because so many of us 
are doing just that.
