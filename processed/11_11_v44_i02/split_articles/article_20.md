T
he former world champion 
L.J. Jenkins was there. So was 
Ryan Dirteater, who’d won the 
tournament two weeks earlier in Wichita, 
along with a cadre of talented Brazilians, 
including this year’s favorite for the 
championship, a 23-year-old from Pilar 
do Sul, São Paulo, named Silvano Alves. 
The best in the world were buckin’ bulls 
in downtown Hartford. You had to think 
they were in the wrong city, and possibly 
the wrong century. Ain’t no cowboys in 
these parts, someone should have warned 
the organizers of the Professional Bull 
Riders, which is the major league of bull 
riding and the governing body for what 
may be this country’s newest spectator 
sport.


I arrived in Hartford on a Friday 
night. On my way to the XL Civic 
Center, I drove past clubs, bars, and 
darkened 
office 
buildings, 
and—
inexplicably—small crowds of cowboys 
and cowgirls of all ages wearing denim 
and plaid and boots. The scene outside 
the city’s virtuous Old Statehouse was a 
foreigner’s confused vision of America: 
cowboy hats leaning together and proud, 
colonial brick.


I gradually realized few of them were 
anything like “real cowboys”—whatever 
that meant—and that was disappointing, 
because I had come to Hartford with the 
intention of meeting one. I was looking 
for someone who appeared more 
comfortable on an animal’s back than on 
his own two feet, with a leathery face and 
a lean jaw and an intense, flat gaze, like 
you might use to stare down a bull. I had 
come out of curiosity. You see, I’m one 
of that rare species of troglodyte that 
Flint Rasmussen, the Bull Riders’ clown, 
kept calling “city people.” (“People are 
staring at me—city people,” he told the 
audience. The crowd at the Civic Center 
had just dressed up for the night. They 
were city people too.) I felt that after 
having lived here for twenty-one years, 
it was time to learn what America was 
really all about.


Yet 
although 
someone 
says 
something politically incorrect and 
vaguely offensive into the arena’s 
microphone about once a night, I 
discovered bull riding shows are for 
the most part designed to appeal to 
people like me as well, not only to true 
Americans. The prayer that’s repeated 
before the bull riding begins each night 
noticeably avoids the words “Jesus” and 
“Christ.”


I caught Rasmussen shortly after 
he had officially declared his candidacy 
for the 2012 presidential election. He 
had aimed a pair of political jokes right 
and left—following a line about joining 
the other clowns in the presidential race 
with “I don’t have time to occupy Wall 
Street, because I have a job”—but he 
told me he almost always avoids political 
comedy. “These people pay money to 
come and sit for two and a half hours 
where they’re not watching the news,” 
he said.


The 
Professional 
Bull 
Riders 
have changed the sport, and if I had 
gone looking for a genuine hick good 
time, I wasn’t going to find one. The 
organization is building a national 
television audience, and bull riding is 
becoming corporate and mainstream. 
As Jeff Robinson joked, “We’re not 
just redneck-based oriented anymore.” 
Robinson is one of the country’s major 
stock contractors. That is, he owns 
thirty-five of the bulls who were in 
Hartford, including Stanley FatMax, a 
bull named after the hardware brand, 
and New Britain – 1843, named for 
the town and year in which Stanley was 
founded. Several of the wildest, most 
powerful bulls in the world are also his, 
including I’m a Gangster and Chicken 
on a Chain, who would be bucking in 
the World Finals in Las Vegas at the end 
of October.


There would be only one more 
stop on the riders’ tour before they went 
to Las Vegas. It was a last opportunity 
for some of them to qualify for the 
championship, so the stakes were high.


O
f 
course, 
it 
is 
a 
gross 
oversimplification to say that this 
country is split into city people and cattle 
people and they never talk to each other. 
I myself have had several experiences 
with the other kind of American.


There was, for example, that one 
fellow, my friend’s cousin’s husband, a 
retired engineer whom I met at a dinner 
party in Knights Landing, California. If 
you haven’t heard of Knights Landing, 
that’s because it’s not much more than 
a plot of houses amid other plots of 
rice, tomatoes, and sunflowers the same 
size and shape. The engineer was a short 
man with pale blue eyes whose hobby 
was racing automobiles and who spoke 
in deliberate, exact sentences. “I like Bill 
O’Reilly,” he told me. “I think he calls a 
spade a spade.” I really wanted to ask him 
about politics because he seemed like an 
intelligent man with strong opinions and 
a point of view unfamiliar to me. We 
stayed away from the subject, though. 
It seemed in the past he’d had heated 
disagreements with his father-in-law, 
who was sitting at the head of the table 
and telling stories about immigrating 
from Mexico as a young man, becoming 
a farm operator, and harvesting more 
than fifty thousand tons of processing 
tomatoes in one bumper year. America 
meant very different things to those two 
men. Besides, the engineer’s mother-
in-law kept serving me more of her 
enchiladas.


Then there was the woman who 
spent many months trying to get my 
grandpa to marry her. The relationship 
finally ended earlier this year. “She 
thought Jesus wouldn’t like her,” 
my grandpa said. “But people need 
companionship, and I think He would 
understand that.” Getting married didn’t 
make sense to him, though, because 
nothing of that kind was going to happen 
anyway. I have always wished I could 
share my grandpa’s magnetism, but I’ve 
at last come to admit that at 94, he is the 
handsomer man by far.


I called my grandpa the morning I 
left New Haven for Hartford. “Whatever 
you do, don’t get on a bull’s back,” he 
warned.


“I wouldn’t ever have thought of it 
if you hadn’t suggested it,” I said.


A
t the back entrance to the Civic 
Center in Hartford, I met a pair of 
technicians. One of them had twirled the 
ends of his impressive moustache. The 
other looked me up and down and said, 
“If you came to work this show, you’re 
definitely overdressed.” I had thrown 
on a pair of jeans and my blue blazer 
because—well, obviously, the corduroy 
one would have been out of place. As 
it turns out, the blazer and jeans is a 
good strategy if you’re going to watch 
bull riding. It’s what the announcers and 
officials wear who aren’t cowboys. What 
gave me away was the necktie.


I explained that I was there to 
report on the event. “Don’t speak to this 
man; he’s from the evil news media!” 
the technician joked to his partner. This 
might be a difficult weekend, I thought 
then, but as it turned out, everyone 
involved with the bull riding seemed 
happy to have me hanging around. A 
moment later my phone vibrated. It 
was Jack Carnefix, the Professional Bull 
Riders’ affable press officer. I excused 
myself and met Carnefix in the bowels 
of the Civic Center, where he explained 
what bull riding is all about.


“First thing, nothing’s tied around 
the bull’s balls. That’s the most common 
question,” he said. A rope called a flank 
strap is tied around the bull’s waist to 
encourage him to buck harder. It’s an 
annoyance to the animal, who will try to 
kick it off with his hind legs. Another 
rope, the bull rope, is wrapped tightly 
around the bull’s shoulders and over the 
rider’s palm.


The rider must keep his grip on the 
bull rope with his other hand free for 
eight seconds. If he isn’t thrown before 
then, the ride qualifies, and the rider is 
awarded a score out of a hundred points 
by four judges who consider whether the 
rider appears in control and how hard 
the bull is bucking. A decent score is 
between eighty and ninety points; scores 
above ninety points are rare.


Besides the rider, there would be 
several others in the arena. The three 
bullfighters would protect the riders 
after they’d been thrown by distracting 
the bulls. “If you’re a rider, and you get 
thrown, first you got to figure out which 
way is up. Then you’re running for the 
nearest fence,” Carnefix said. There 
would also be a mounted cowboy, who 
would lasso a bull if the animal couldn’t 
find the exit after throwing his rider. 
Presidential hopeful Rasmussen would 
also be present.


Rasmussen (it is not a pseudonym) 
is officially an “entertainer,” not a rodeo 
clown, because the Professional Bull 
Riders don’t organize rodeos, and they’re 
very sensitive about the distinction. At 
a rodeo, you’ll also see steer wrestling, 
cutting shows, saddle- and bareback-
bronco bucking, and barrel racing, 
among other competitions. “Whatever 
you do, don’t call us a rodeo,” Carnefix 
told me later.


But before I saw any of these people, 
the lights in the Civic Center went down, 
and a movie about the United States 
Air Force was played for the audience 
“They’re just 
living the little 
rock-star lives 
that they’ve built 
for their little 
bull-buckin’ 
selves.”
