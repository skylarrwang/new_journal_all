Cut A Rug
John Kebabian’s desk is in the 
corner of the storefront, almost hidden 
behind a pile of small rugs. It lacks 
modern technological gadgets, including 
a computer. Here, John neatly records 
transactions by hand on spreadsheets 
collected in a black binder. The whole 
interior of the store has an old quality 
about it, reminding customers that 
Kebabian’s Oriental Rugs has been in 
John’s family for more than a century. 
It is clean, with hardwood floors, solid 
white walls, and a high ceiling adorned 
with a pattern of white tiles that are 
elegant in their simplicity. The plainness 
emphasizes the vibrant colors and 
chaotic patterns of the rugs.


In the back of the store sits a 
brand new 21-inch Apple desktop 
computer, which John’s wife Peggy says 
they invested in so their “Web site guy” 
can help them create and edit video 
blog posts. Every week, Peggy posts a 
short video called “Rug of the Week” 
to Kebabian’s Facebook page in which 
John tells the story of the chosen rug. 
She herself is also updating the store’s 
Web site. The new site’s launch date is 
November 1, and Peggy excitedly tells 
me it will be totally redesigned, complete 
with a virtual tour of the store.


The store’s red bricks stand out 
among the pale pink and gray and white 
of its neighbors on Elm Street, drawing 
attention to bold white paint on the side 
wall that proudly proclaims Kebabian’s, 
the name of John’s great-great uncle, 
also called John. The first John Kebabian 
was an Armenian who had attended 
Robert College, a school for expatriate 
children in the former Constantinople. 
He arrived in New Haven in 1882 as a 
Yale College student. In those days, Yale 
did not offer financial aid, so he sold 
oriental rugs to pay for his tuition.


The current John Kebabian took 
over the store in 1992, abandoning his 
molecular biophysics and biochemistry 
degree at Yale’s Graduate School of Arts 
and Sciences when his father retired 
due to illness. He had planned to work 
as a medical researcher and teacher 
before taking over the business. Now he 
purchases high-quality hand-woven rugs 
from Central Asian countries, including 
Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and 
Tibet.


John has continued the store’s 
tradition of repairing rugs by hand. 
Although 
sewing 
machines 
make 
repairing rugs easier and faster, the result 
is inferior, he says. The methods used at 
Kebabian’s may seem outdated and time-
consuming, but they are thorough.


Marcy Kebabian, John’s sister, is 
mending a rug. “We don’t use machines 
here,” Marcy clarifies, her hands busy 
with invisible stitches. “This rug here? 
The guy is giving it to his son, but he 
wants it repaired first. I have to do the 
invisible stitch because it’s double-sided, 
so you wouldn’t want to see the stitch on 
either side.” She bends her head close to 
the rug, illuminated by a bright lamp, and 
deftly makes a stitch.


Even when cleaning the rugs, the 
store uses the method that has been in 
place for decades. Though machines 
are available that wash rugs, they aren’t 
thorough enough, especially when used 
on the handwoven rugs Kebabian’s 
sells. John proudly shows me the 
vacuum cleaners the staff uses instead. 
“You can’t even find these anywhere 
anymore!” John says. Indeed, they look 
like props taken from the set of Mad 
Men, the television show set in the 1960s: 
a silver pole connected to the suction 
piece, with a big red bag hanging from 
the back to collect the dust. The store’s 
traditions can mean hard work for the 
staff. “I can eat whatever I want, because 
it’s a workout every day here,” says Craig 
Tyska, who has worked at Kebabian’s for 
many years.


All the same, Peggy is working to 
modernize the stubbornly old-fashioned 
store’s branding and media presence. 
“We’re trying to bring things up to date. 
We have such great products, and we 
want to use all this new social technology 
to get the word out, bring the caliber of 
our media resources up to that of our 
rugs,” she says. If she succeeds, she’ll 
have demonstrated that new media 
doesn’t necessarily mean the end of old 
traditions.

The Weirdoes Make 
Some Good Points
One sign read, “Our economy could 
be more fair.” Well, that was what it was 
all about, I guess. As I wandered through 
the crowd at Occupy Wall Street on a 
Saturday last month I saw that all the 
usual suspects were out. Dreadlocked, 
shirtless, smelly backpackers littered 
the ground with their wool blankets 
and blue plastic tarps and gave each 
other back massages. Mixed in among 
them, middle-aged, bald anticapitalists 
handed out Socialist Party literature and 
The Occupied Wall Street Journal and told 
anyone who would listen to “open your 
eyes to the coming revolution.” 


I guess you could say a lot of these 
guys were weird. One lady told me that 
the Federal Reserve was completely 
responsible for the financial collapse 
because it was controlled by the 
Rockefellers, the Morgans, and the mafia, 
and then said something like “America-
is-turning-into-Nazi-Germany.” An old 
man there said he had won an Emmy for 
his documentary filmmaking, and that he 
had been a protester all his life, at the ’63 
march with Martin Luther King, Jr., the 
’68 protests against “the war,” and the 
’03 protests against “the other war,” but 
that this gathering at Zuccotti Park in 
downtown Manhattan was the greatest 
sharing and interchange of humanity 
he’d ever seen. I asked him to tell me the 
name of one of his films and he dodged 
the question, muttering something about 
anti-Semitism in Poland. 


I stopped trying to talk to people 
and checked out the signs. “This is what 
democracy looks like.” “We are the 99 
percent.” “Mr. President, tear down this 
Wall (Street).” “Todos somos O.W.S.” “End 
all war; End all greed; End the fed.” 
“I’m a human being not a commodity.” 
“Ronald Reagan sucked balls.”


Occupy Wall Street is a movement 
of discontents. Lefties of all stripes, 
from Communists to anarchists to 
supporters of President Barack Obama 
to independents—even some Ron Paul 
libertarians—gathered to stare down the 
New York Stock Exchange and display 
to the bankers, traders, and CEOs the 
mass of humanity that didn’t like what 
Wall Street was doing. Then the police 
told them to move, so they spilled into 
a nearby park and stared down a Brooks 
Brothers store and a Burger King. 


This kind of thing wasn’t new 
to me. I’d been in Madrid during the
