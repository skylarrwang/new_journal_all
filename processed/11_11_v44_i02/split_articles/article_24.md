Larry Smith turned the bow of 
his 
weathered, 
flat-bottomed 
skiff toward the Long Island 
Sound. More than forty other sailboats, 
motorboats, and kayaks were moving 
with him. July 10 was the kind of bright 
summer Sunday when sunlight shocks 
the seascape into a series of horizons 
from deck to sky. Before they reached 
the chop and swell of New Haven 
Harbor, the boats turned back across 
the shallower, calmer waters of Morris 
Cove. They swung close to the Pardee 
seawall, where more than a hundred 
protestors waved signs printed in crisp, 
simple black letters. They read, “No 
toxic sludge here!” and “Don’t dump in 
Morris Cove!” A kayaker flew the Jolly 
Roger off his stern, and hand-drawn 
“No Dumping” banners draped the 
flanks of many of the boats. Onshore, 
Mayor John DeStefano, Jr., mugged 
for the press with a child from Morris 
Cove who wore a blue crab costume. 
U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro stood 
nearby, her back to the seawall, using a 
megaphone to express her support for 
the protestors in their fight against the 
United States Army Corps of Engineers’ 
plan to dump contaminated material in 
the cove.


The flotilla circumnavigated the 
cove twice, passing the soft gray beach, 
the seawall, the canted auburn cliffs, and 
then the sound’s great blue expanse. The 
boats ran along the outermost moorings 
of the New Haven Yacht Club, really 
more of a working man’s boating 
cooperative, where Smith is a senior 
member, and floated through where the 
sailors and their children swim. Their 
keels traced a sea-floor anomaly that 
the boaters could not see, a rectangular 
trench 2,450 by 650 feet, where the cove 
floor sinks more than a fathom below its 
surrounding bed. The edge of the trench 
is less than five hundred feet from shore. 
Decades earlier, Morris Cove had given 
a strip of its gravel and sand sea floor to 
the construction of Interstate 95, leaving 
a depression, or borrow pit, beneath its 
waters. And in February 2010, the Army 
Corps announced its intention to fill the 
borrow pit with toxic debris.
