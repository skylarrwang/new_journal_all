liberal parents, and that those who 
haven’t experienced hardship in life, 
won’t experience it, and won’t cause 
it,” he added. “That is a very dangerous 
assumption.”
Pomona already had a number of 
policies in place intended to prevent 
sexual assault and to support and 
protect victims before receiving April’s 
letter. These included providing private 
and group counseling for survivors, 
in addition to the support Schudson’s 
group offers. Pomona also allows a 
victim to request special academic 
considerations, such as dropping a class 
without penalty after the regular deadline 
if the assailant is also in the class. The 
university recently added a session to 
its freshman orientation program for a 
more engaging and thorough discussion 
of sexual assault. 
One of the more important new 
policies adopted this fall, however, 
met 
with 
criticism 
from 
some 
Pomona students. The Dear Colleague 
letter requires that schools use a 
“preponderance of evidence” standard 
of proof in grievance procedures for 
sexual harassment or assault. If sexual 
harassment or violence is more likely than 
not to have occurred, then a student can 
be punished. The standard is now part 
of Pomona’s student disciplinary code. 
“It was clear that 
universities 
needed assistance 
in determining 
how Title IX 
applies in cases of 
alleged sexual 
violence.”
Office for Civil Rights in 2006 for failing 
to notify students of an on-campus 
rape and murder. These are just a few 
examples.
“It was clear from OCR’s work 
investigating 
individual 
complaints, 
conducting compliance reviews, and 
responding 
to 
technical 
assistance 
requests 
that 
needed 
assistance in determining how Title 
IX applies in cases of alleged sexual 
violence,” Bradshaw explained.
The Office for Civil Rights is hoping 
the Dear Colleague letter will clarify 
a university’s responsibilities when it 
comes to sexual violence and that these 
recommendations and guidelines will 
help to create campuses in which sexual 
assault occurs less frequently, or when 
it does occur, to assure that the victims 
can find emotional and disciplinary 
resolution.
When asked if schools are ever 
uncooperative, Bradshaw said, “It’s 
rare.” He also explained that the first 
action the Office for Civil Rights initiates 
with a non-complying institution is to 
negotiate a resolution agreement with 
the university to bring it into compliance. 
He said that in the vast majority of cases, 
this is sufficient action.
P
omona 
College 
in 
Claremont, 
California, is one school that has 
responded swiftly to the letter. The 
school revised its code of conduct 
in September, bypassing the student 
comment period typically required for 
such changes because the change was 
federally mandated. Instead, the school 
held a two-week period for student 
discussion after enacting the new policy.
Zach Schudson, a junior at Pomona 
and a member of the student group 
Advocates for Survivors of Sexual 
Assault, said that he appreciated how 
conscientious the administration at 
Pomona has been in engaging with 
issues of sexual violence. “People like 
to pretend that this is a wonderful place, 
but it’s not perfect,” Schudson said. 
His classmates assume “that people 
who come to this school all come from 
white, middle-class backgrounds with

The legal system employs various 
standards of evidence for different 
levels of litigation. In criminal trials, 
the standard is highest, requiring the 
prosecution to prove guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt. But in most civil 
suits, as well as in some criminal 
proceedings such as parole violation 
hearings, the plaintiff must only provide 
a preponderance of evidence. This is 
also the standard of proof used in grand 
jury proceedings. In a 2002 National 
Institute of Justice study, approximately 
80 percent of the schools that identified 
a particular evidentiary standard for 
sexual-assault disciplinary proceedings 
already employed the preponderance of 
evidence standard. 
Despite the standard’s prevalence, 
national organizations such as the 
American Association of University 
Professors and the Foundation for 
Individual Rights in Education have 
criticized it. Both groups have sent letters 
to Assistant Secretary Russlynn Ali at 
the Office for Civil Rights questioning 
whether the lower standard still complies 
with the basic principles of the judicial 
process and expressing reservations 
about the severity of consequences for 
the falsely convicted, comparing the 
standard to a “tie goes to the runner” 
mentality.
The editorial board of The Student 
Life, the weekly newspaper at Pomona, 
also objected to the new standard, 
claiming that it discounted “the value of 
a legal right that lies at the heart of our 
democratic process.”
A few days later, The Student Life 
published a response from Schudson. 
He argued that the preponderance 
of evidence standard of proof is an 
appropriate response to this unique type 
of case because sexual assault does not 
always result in forensic evidence.
Schudson cited data from a 2010 
study by David Lisak, a psychologist at 
Northeastern University, and several 
of his colleagues, which estimated the 
rate of false rape allegations over one 
ten-year period at just under 6 percent. 
As Schudson wrote, “the presumption 
of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ that

protects alleged perpetrators mutates 
into a presumption of ‘lying until proven 
truthful’ for survivors.”
Schudson’s response is compelling. 
Just as much as alleged perpetrators of 
sexual assault deserve to be presumed 
innocent, victims of assault should not 
be presumed liars. Preponderance of 
evidence is a good compromise between 
both parties in cases such as these, where 
hard evidence is often difficult to find. 
Many criticisms of the standard may 
ultimately stem from an assumption 
that women who accuse men of rape 
are often untruthful, or from a mistaken 
belief that sexual assault is uncommon.
T
he University of Maryland is 
also 
working 
include 
the 
preponderance of evidence in its code 
of conduct in response to the letter from 
the Office of Civil Rights. Currently, 
the university’s published Code of 
Student Conduct states that in all cases 
brought before the grievance boards, 
the “burden of proof shall be upon 
the complainant, who must establish 
the guilt of the respondent by clear and 
convincing evidence.” Diane Krejsa, 
senior university counsel at Maryland, 
explained that a separate committee has 
also been meeting every other month 
since the summer to review any needed 
changes and updates to the university’s 
disciplinary procedures for sexual assault 
cases.
But in Maryland’s case, students 
had also been fighting administrators for 
greater transparency. For three years, a 
group of persistent journalism students 
and one professor worked on a project 
to track cases of sexual assault at their 
university. Just weeks before the Dear 
Colleague letter was sent to campus 
officials, the students obtained a list from 
Maryland’s Office of Student Conduct 
of all the students in the past decade 
found guilty of sexual assault. Sue Kopen 
Katcef, a lecturer in the Merrill College 
of Journalism at Maryland, led the 
students in investigating sexual violence 
there. When she first presented the idea 
to her journalism class three years ago, 
she said, “[My students] looked at me 
like I was crazy.” But by the end of the 
semester, both men and women in the 
class had committed themselves to the 
project, upset by the predatory behavior 
of some of their fellow students. The 
students that year produced an award-
winning radio program based on their 
research.
Katcef didn’t stop there. Semester 
by semester, she helped her students 
follow the laws all the way to the top of 
the state of Maryland’s legal system. The 
university at first refused to release the 
names of guilty students by claiming they 
were protected under the federal Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
Sexual violence “is not something that’s 
unique to the university of Maryland,” 
Katcef said. “This is a problem that is 
pervasive on college campuses, private 
and public, across the country.”
In 2000, the National Institute of 
Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
collaborated on a comprehensive survey 
of college women about sexual assault. 
Their data demonstrate that in fact 
nearly 5 percent of college women are 
victimized (experience completed or 
attempted assault) each calendar year. 
The conclusions of this Department of 
Justice survey, when applied to a campus 
of over 26,000 undergraduates, half of 
them female, indicate that an average of 
675 women at Maryland may be victims 
of attempted or completed sexual assault 
each year.
When Katcef’s students finally 
obtained the list of students who had 



21
been disciplined by Maryland’s grievance 
boards in the last ten years, there were 
only four names. If sexual violence is 
a huge problem, why don’t more cases 
come before university disciplinary 
committees?
Extrapolating their data to a 
four-year college career, the Justice 
Department researchers observed that 
the statistic could climb to 20 percent 
of the collegiate female population. 
(A 1985 survey of over 3,500 college 
women about sexual violence published 
in Ms. Magazine also found that one in 
five women were victims of sexual 
violence. While the statistic was widely 
accepted and cited throughout the 1990s, 
there were problems with the survey’s 
methods, making it easy for skeptics to 
dismiss its findings. This more rigorous 
federal survey unfortunately confirmed 
the older estimate.)
The University of Maryland’s list 
reveals the problem in how victims 
of sexual violence understand their 
experiences and whether they choose 
to report them. “Many women do not 
characterize their sexual victimizations 
as a crime for a number of reasons 
(such as embarrassment, not clearly 
understanding the legal definition of 
rape, or not wanting to define someone 
they know who victimized them as a 
rapist) or because they blame themselves 
for their sexual assault,” noted writers of 
the Department of Justice. In addition 
to making procedural modifications, 
universities must improve education 
about sexual violence.
Y
ale University’s code of conduct 
already uses the preponderance 
of evidence standard. “I think the 
evidential standard is definitely more 
applicable than clear and convincing 
evidence because establishing guilt or 
innocence is already so difficult” in cases 
of sexual violence, Assistant Dean Jill 
Cutler said. Cutler sat through many 
sexual misconduct proceedings during 
her fourteen years as the secretary of the 
Yale’s Executive Committee. The cases 
are complicated by factors like alcohol, 
lack of witnesses, and the fact that most 
cases of sexual assault at Yale involve 
acquaintances.
During the past year, though, Yale 
has reassessed its sexual misconduct 
policies anyway. Among other changes, 
Yale now uses stronger, more specific 
language in the student code of conduct 
explaining what qualifies as sexual 
harassment and assault. The grievance 
procedure 
for 
victims 
of 
sexual 
violence—in the past an opaque and 
confusing process—has been unified 
into a single University-Wide Committee 
on Sexual Misconduct.
That committee will also appoint 
a fact-finder, someone unaffiliated with 
the university, for each case. “I think it 
will help greatly to have independent 
outside investigators who can spring 
into action and collect the facts as soon 
as a case is brought to light, and who will 
have the time and energy to interview 
all the people whose observations might 
be relevant to the chain of events,” 
said Cutler. It is important that the 
investigators are not professors, who 
often are too busy to gather all the 
information a committee needs to make 
a decision.
Proper investigation of sexual 
violence cases was mentioned briefly in 
the Dear Colleague letter, but the Office 
of Civil Rights focused on the speed of 
investigations (so that victims are not 
dragged through months and months of 
hearings) rather than on the individuals 
doing the investigating.
Though some have criticized Yale’s 
efforts to change how the University 
handles sexual misconduct as ponderous 
and ineffectual, the administration’s 
attitude contrasts with what Schudson 
calls an inadequate response from 
Pomona College officials.
The administration there is making 
changes only because the Office of Civil 
Rights has required it to do so, according 
to Schudson. The letter “has regulatory 
authority, so that’s what’s important to 
us,” Miriam Feldblum, a dean at Pomona, 
told The Student Life. As far as Schudson 
is concerned, it was like saying, “Because 
we had to.”
The administration didn’t hesitate 
to make changes that will help victims 
of sexual violence find justice. However, 
if Schudson is correct, Feldblum’s 
attitude also demonstrates a lack of 
understanding of the depth of the 
problem and the need for administrators 
to cooperate in addressing it.
The Dear Colleague letter began 
with the premise that changes had to 
be made so that education could remain 
the great American equalizer. The 
threat of terminating federal funds is an 
effective one, as Pomona’s case shows. 
But for universities to alter a campus 
culture that fosters—or at least turns a 
blind eye to—victim blaming and other 
dangerous assumptions, they will need 
to do much more than just follow the 
guidelines in the Office of Civil Rights 
letter. The federal bureaucracy has 
nothing to do with some of the best 
examples of effective action to combat 
sexual violence, from Schudson’s and his 
friends’ determined advocacy at Pomona 
to Katcef’s sleuthing. Instead, students 
and administrators alike must take a long 
look at their own campuses’ specific 
failings and find ways of creating a safer, 
saner sexual culture.
