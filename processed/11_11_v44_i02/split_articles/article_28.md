remained silent as controversy built 
over the last year and a half, and she is 
inclined to think the department might 
ask the Army Corps to revise its plan. 
“The only thing hard to gauge is 
how much latitude the Army Corps 
has,” Larry Smith, who is attending the 
meeting, concludes.

Bosch refuses to rely on last year’s 
good faith, particularly in light of the 
project’s delay. The residents have been 
relying on shock appeal to galvanize 
the surrounding community. Some 
members of NHPOWer! are concerned 
about losing popular following. “Their 
hope is that in a few years enough of us 
will forget so they can slip it through,” 
Northrup says of the Army Corps. By 
the end of the meeting, the residents 
have resolved to begin letter-writing 
campaigns to both this year’s incoming 
aldermen and Senators Joe Lieberman 
and Richard Blumenthal. 

Morris Cover Robert Castiglione 
had spoken up early in the meeting. 
That morning he’d watched, through 
binoculars, a large boat dragging a flat 
plate through the water and periodically 
raising and rinsing it for three hours in 
the section of cove facing his house.

Keegan explains that the Army 
Corps is conducting additional research 
into water current velocities, salinity, and 
quality within the pit, as measured by 
platforms installed in the cove bed for 
sixty days, because the public wants more 
information—not because the Army 
Corps feels any more is needed. “All of 
our data tells us there is no impact at all,” 
Keegan says. But he emphasizes that the 
engineers will evaluate the additional 
information. “I wouldn’t have done the 
surveys if I didn’t have an open mind,” 
he says. Even if Keegan has an open 
mind, it’s hard to imagine what could 
swing the Army Corps’s financially 
loaded decision.

It’s clear that the Army Corps is 
focused on minimizing its expenses. 
Keegan has never hidden that. The 
goals of NHPOWer!’s are even more 
transparent. But it’s not obvious how 
influence and legal authority will 
combine to determine whether the 
disposal goes through. So far, the 
conflict has consisted largely of drawing 
lines and recruiting troops. For now, the 
Morris Cove residents can only continue 
consolidating support among residents 
and elected officials.

A
utumn on Morris Cove means it’s 
time to raise the sailboats out of the 
water and put them up on blocks. Only 
a few weeks remain until the oystermen 
arrive to harvest the bottom feeders. 
Kids bike up and down the sidewalks, 
rolling over pressed, wet leaves.

It’s October once more. Larry Smith 
circles the borrow pit in an 18-foot skiff. 
The air smells of healthy brine, the sea 
is calm, and the cove’s sailboats point 
their noses into a soft, dusk breeze. The 
engine is cut, and high pings mark the 
sound of halyards slapping the vessel’s 
metal masts. The hole stretches nearly a 
half-mile, centered under an imaginary 
line that runs from an outcropping on 
the southern edge of the cove to the 
auburn cliffs beneath Fort Nathan Hale. 
Smith can’t see it below the dark surface 
of the sea.

An airhorn wails from a few 
moorings away, and the skiff motors 
over to pick up two sailors and ferry 
them back to the dock. They look like 
Smith: sun-tanned and white-haired, of 
an age to have spent Vietnam avoiding 
the draft by service in the Peace Corps 
and then teaching in the New York 
City public school system, as Smith did. 
Smith then spent his career teaching 
special-needs students at their homes. 
The sailors’ faded jeans and dull white 
shirts match the worn shades of the 
cove and its boat hulls. Smith explains 
that he was checking out the hole and 
they tease him about his determination 
to keep the damn thing clean. 

The moorings extend right up to the 
edge of the hole. “One member swears 
he’s in the pit every year,” Smith says. 
The man is convinced that his anchor 
drags in the pit and, Smith concedes, 
“He might be right.” Smith is sure that 
the resistance to the dumping plan won’t 
weaken, as the most vehement protestors 
live and sail from this spot. It was Nick 
Proctor, another senior club member, 
whose daughter first wore the Morris 
Cove protests’ blue crab costume five 
years ago for Halloween. Smith explains 
that the shock that all local boaters 
feel, Covers or not, when they hear the 
proposal, stems from their relationships 
with the waters they sail. They have all 
watched the Long Island Sound grow 
cleaner over the last two decades. “It 
doesn’t feel spiritually right to fill the pit 
with contaminants when the trend has 
been to improve,” he says. 

Much of the fervor with which 
citizens have reacted to the plan to dump 
Bridgeport’s waste in the cove is powered 
by those feelings. Smith explains that 
people react primally, territorially, to 
the plan. Residents think things like, 
“‘They’re going to dump their shit in my 
harbor? No way!’” He gazes across the 
flat grey plain of sleeping sea and sky. 
The Army Corps engineers, Smith says, 
“don’t have any poetry.” 

When the sun sets today, it is a slow, 
hazy descent. One of the houses a few 
rows back from the cove has been home 
to Robert Castiglione for more than 
sixty years. Castiglione is firmly opposed 
to the Army Corps’ disposal plan. “Not 
in my backyard,” he says emphatically. 
Castiglione is no less self-interested 
than the other actors in this underwater 
drama. Keegan wants to finish the job, 
Bridgeport wants increased shipping 
access, and elected officials want to be 
re-elected. Though money and influence 
motivate them, they’re ultimately limited 
by the natural environment, which 
always has tended to resist the control 
of sailors and engineers alike.

Smith circles it in his skiff. The 
Army Corps proposal turns on it. So 
now do the lives of the other Covers.
There is a hole in Morris Cove.
