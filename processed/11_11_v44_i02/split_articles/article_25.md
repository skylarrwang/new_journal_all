A
t the time of Christ’s birth, the 
largest city in the world after Rome 
was Ephesus, home to the Temple of 
Artemis. One thousand years later, 
Ephesus had become a small village, 
rendered insignificant to the world by 
the silting of its harbor. Contemporary 
Bridgeport is struggling with what could 
be its own demise by dirt.


Bridgeport is one of Connecticut’s 
three deep-sea ports (New Haven and 
New London are the other two), and 
its location at a nexus of highways 
and railroad lines makes it a desirable 
shipping destination. But Bridgeport 
Harbor has not been dredged since 1964, 
and when navigation channels grow 
too shallow, the large shipping vessels 
that bring petroleum and other goods 
must unload their cargo offshore. Many 
companies move on to new destination 
ports. Turbana, the banana importer, left 
Bridgeport for Philadelphia in 2008.


Bridgeport’s unemployment rate 
has been rising—it was around 13 
percent this fall—and the city has passed 
anti-blight ordinances to prohibit the 
accumulation of debris like tires or 
abandoned cars on private property. 
While the city’s economic problems have 
other causes besides stagnant shipping, 
the restoration of old trade patterns and 
the construction of new might help the 
city achieve recovery.


The Panama Canal is currently in 
the middle of an expansion—its first 
ever—that is scheduled to be completed 
in three years. The canal is adding a new 
lane of traffic and locks on both its 
Atlantic and Pacific sides. The expansion 
could increase the number of massive 
shipping tankers passing from Asia to 
the eastern United States by 30 percent 
and would also admit tankers twice to 


in materials produced after 1979, but 
because they do not break down, 
PCBs leak from old waste and tend 
to accumulate in fish and sediment. 
The Army Corps has used CAD cell 
technology intended to contain these 
urban and industrial pollutants in other 
New England harbors. Boston, Norwich, 
and New London all have cells installed 
by the Army Corps, which is obligated to 
maintain federal navigation channels at 
the request of port agencies. When the 
Bridgeport Port Authority pushed for a 
dredging plan, they likely didn’t have the 
use of Morris Cove in mind.


Last fall, the protesters gathered 
2,200 signatures for a petition against 
the dumping proposal, hoping to put 
pressure on public officials before 
the midterm election. By October 30, 
2010, they had won the public support 
of DeStefano, DeLauro, and then-
gubernatorial candidate Dannel Malloy, 
who all showed up to that Saturday’s 
shore-bound protest. But while Malloy 
condemned the Morris Cove disposal, 
he emphasized that he also thought 
dredging in Bridgeport was important 
for the state’s economy.


The 
Army 
Corps’s 
case 
for 
dumping in Morris Cove is threefold. 
First, it saves Bridgeport and the federal 
government millions of dollars. Second, 
it fills an unnatural hole that has very 
little biological activity. Third, the new 
CAD cell would create twenty-four 
more acres of oyster habitat in Morris 
Cove. The Covers, on the other hand, 
fear the pollution of their cove and their 
backyards. But more important, they 
worry that the Corps doesn’t entirely 
know what it is doing.


Smith and fellow Morris Cover 
Ben Northrup organized the floating 
protest, entreating neighbors and up-
river yacht club members to bring their 
voices and their vessels. The boating 
community rallied, filling the cove on 
that midsummer day with members 
of more than five other boating clubs. 
These boaters, and Smith, felt that 
storing contaminated sludge in the inlet 
just didn’t make sense—not when they 
had been watching New Haven Harbor 
begin to get clean again, the fish return, 
and the cove’s waters brighten and clear.


The dumping in Morris Cove that 
Smith and his neighbors are fighting is a 
crucial component of the Army Corps’s 
plan for dredging Bridgeport’s shipping 
channels. The Army Corps proposes 
relocating 197,000 cubic yards of toxic 
mud to Morris Cove. The waste would 
travel the twenty-five miles by barge, 
descend in a plume into the pit, and then 
spend the next nine months settling into 
its new home. At that point the Corps 
would return to cap the refuse with a 
Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) cell 
seal, a scab of clean material. The entire 
$42 million project would generate ten 
times as much waste as would be stored 
in Morris Cove, but the rest would go 
into a new CAD cell in Bridgeport 
Harbor, with the material rated “suitable 
for open water disposal” released at a 
designated site in the sound.


The waste to be stored in Morris 
Cove contains high concentrations 
of chemicals called polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) and dangerous heavy 
metals. The metals can cause respiratory 
and gastrointestinal damage, but it is 
the PCBs that rile the Covers. These 
well-known carcinogens were banned
