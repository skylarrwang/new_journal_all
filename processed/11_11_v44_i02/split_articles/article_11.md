at a week-long Balkan music workshop 
in Ashoken, New York, almost three 
decades ago, Zlatne Uste, which Drew 
describes as “a classic, Serbian-style 
brass band,” has been at the centre of the 
Balkan music community in New York 
City. At their show in September, I found 
myself dancing in a sea of Brooklyn 
hipsters as well as ladies who could’ve 
been my grandmother. Traditional circle 
dances in 11/8 time, pogoing, free-style 
grooving—we did it all.


New Haven has never had as vibrant 
a scene as New York, but the Elm City 
did have its own folk-dance boom in 
the ’70s. Every week, Hendrie Hall was 
packed, the floor shivering in time to 
Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek rhythms. 
Now the Harris brothers are trying to 
re-establish a community around Balkan 
music and dance. “I’m hoping to tap into 
the youthful, inquisitive social ferment I 
associate with colleges and universities,” 
Laine said.


Later in the evening on October 3, 
the Harris brothers’ hope was looking 
less far-fetched than it had been earlier. 
Jennifer Brosious, Laine’s wife, and 
Bonnie Kaplan, a lecturer at the Yale 
School of Medicine, two women who 
have been folk-dancing for decades, 
joined hands and began to weave a 
Serbian line dance between the tables at 
Café Nine. I watched Kaplan’s feet—I 
have never seen sneakers moving so 
gracefully.


Soon, during a fast dance in 7/8 time 
called a rachenitsa, some of the patrons 
who had looked apathetic earlier got up 
to join. Brosious and Kaplan showed 
them when to move their feet and how 
to wave their hands in front of them 
as if they were at a Bulgarian wedding. 
As their stiletto heels fell into rhythm, 
the women began to whoop and yell 
with excitement. Drew took a wild solo. 
Afterwards, I asked Demo Rest, a Café 
Nine regular, whether he knew about 
Balkan music before that night. “This is 
the first night of my Balkanization,” he 
replied. From his grin, it looked like it 
might not be the last.
