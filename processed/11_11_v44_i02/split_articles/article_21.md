on several large screens. The Air Force 
is a sponsor of the Professional Bull 
Riders, and the gist of the movie was 
that the two organizations share a set 
of American values as old and as sacred 
as the Constitution itself. After the film, 
a squadron of about twenty Air Force 
recruits marched into the arena in three 
columns to swear their oaths of service 
publicly and to promise to defend those 
values. They wore blue jeans and blue Air 
Force T-shirts and looked very young. I 
felt bad for the recruit on the corner of 
the phalanx nearest me, who stepped off 
on his right foot and stumbled.

“Ladies and gentlemen: 365 days 
a year, 24/7, may it be here, or may it 
be abroad, they’re men and they’re 
women that protect and defend these 
United States of America,” as one 
of the announcers described the Air 
Force later, emphasizing these. “I think 
it is our American duty to tell them 
from the bottom of our hearts how 
much we appreciate what they do for 
our country.” The audience didn’t need 
the encouragement, though. They’d 
interrupted Lt. Col. Horst Knorreck 
of the 319th Recruiting Squadron with 
spontaneous applause during his speech 
before the swearing-in.

Several minutes later, there was a 
series of loud explosions and heat on 
my face: Carnefix had positioned me 
underneath a set of four flamethrowers 
that were shooting columns of fire to 
a height of around twenty-five feet. 
Flashes of magnesium lit up the Civic 
Center, and the letters “PBR” burned in 
propane on the dirt floor of the arena. 
The announcers introduced the cowboys, 
who ran out of the gate, tipping their 
hats to the audience. The current top 
five riders stood akimbo on platforms 
above the arena. Over their heads, beams 
of light crisscrossed through the smoke 
and more stuff blew up. The ecumenical 
prayer was said (“We don’t only ask it 
of you of our cowboys, we ask it of 
you of our livestock as well”), and the 
319th Recruiting Squadron Honor Guard 
presented the colors.

The National Anthem was followed 
by the Party Rock Anthem as the lights 
came on again.

The Bull Rider’s Prayer
“Father, tonight we come to you asking that you put 
your mighty hand upon this event. We don’t only ask it 
of you of our cowboys, we ask it of you of our livestock 
as well. We thank you for this day. We thank you for the 
gifts you’ve given us. That said, we’d also like to say a 
very special prayer for our servicemen and women, 
whether they be at home or even abroad, protecting 
and defending the freedoms we so dearly love as free 
Americans. We ask this of you in forgiveness of our sins, 
and by your name we pray. Amen.”

I had expected, even hoped for 
ostentatious displays of patriotism, but 
I was so surprised to learn that everybody’s 
shuffuhlin’-shuffuhlin’, 
including 
the 
toughest cowboys in the world and their 
fans, that I missed the first ride: Mike 
Lee, the former world champion from 
Decatur, on a bull named Get Back, for 
eighty-five points. It was a mighty fine 
way to start a weekend of bull ridin’.


It turned out there were several 
reasons for the Professional Bull 
Riders’ presence in Hartford, the group’s 
first visit to the city in their nineteen-
year history. The riders have stopped at 
Mohegan Sun, the casino in Uncasville, 
for the past several years. This year, there 
was a scheduling conflict at Mohegan 
Sun’s arena with the state’s Women’s 
National Basketball Association team, 
the Connecticut Sun, who took priority. 
As to why the cowboys were in the state 
in the first place, Carnefix explained it 
was part of a vision of building a national 
audience for the sport. The organization 
couldn’t just hold events in Texas and 
Oklahoma. “We want California. We 
want Connecticut,” Carnefix said.


That vision seems to belong mostly 
to Ty Murray, one of the twenty bull 
riders who left the rodeo circuit in 1992 
to establish the Professional Bull Riders. 
(“Ty wants to make this a mainstream 
sport. And really all of us do,” Robinson 
told me.) Murray has won the world 
championship nine times, and he gave 
television commentary in Hartford. “I 
want to see it where it’s on ESPN every 
week, just like the other sports,” he told 
me, adding later, “I want to see it grow as 
much as possible. Whenever we go after 
something, we try not to limit ourselves. 
We set our goals pretty big.”


Before the Professional Bull Riders, 
Murray told me, riders competed in  “a 
lot of stand-alone, one-off things that 
different promoters would do. They 
ranged from big and good to little and 
crappy.” His organization has succeeded 
in making the sport “followable,” he said. 
“Football wouldn’t be that big if it was 
just some random game and you didn’t 
know anything about it every Sunday.”


The New York private equity firm 
Spire Capital bought a majority share of 
the Professional Bull Riders in 2007 for 
an undisclosed amount. The same year, 
the cowboys traveled to New York for 
the first time. Bull riding at Madison 
Square Garden was sold out, Murray 
remembers. “We were really adamant 
about going to places like Boston and 
New York City. When we sold out 
Madison Square Garden, it dispelled the 
myth that it was a Western sport.”


Today, the Professional Bull Riders 
estimate their international television 
audience at 100 million. The events are 
broadcast in eighty-five countries. Not 
only has the audience for bull riding 
grown, it has broadened as well. “When 
you look at the crowd at a PBR event 
compared to a more traditional rodeo 
event, you see a more diverse crowd. 
You see young people, you see every 
race, creed, and color,” Murray said. 
“It’s not your traditional everybody’s-in-

jeans-and-hats-and-boots.”

The field is wider, too. Some of 
the riders are city boys, including many 
who had never ridden until their late 
teens. Then there are the Brazilians, 
who held five of the top six spots in the 
overall standings during the Hartford 
tournament. “The Brazilian contingent 
goes stronger every year,” Murray said. 
Many of the Brazilians don’t speak 
English, and when a bull’s name is lost 
in translation before a round, it’s funny 
to see the world’s best riders looking 
confused in the middle of the arena. 
Brazil has always been strong—Adriano 
Moraes, who won the first world 
championship in 1994, is Brazilian. But, 
Murray said, “They dominated this year 
like no other.”


Yet Murray left me with the 
impression that his dreams had less to 
do with audience numbers, much less 
advertising revenue, than with seeing 
bull riders get the respect they deserve.


Though there’s more money in the 
sport now than there used to be, the 
athletes’ earnings remain comparatively 
modest. The top bull riders earn about 
$1.5 million a year in “on-bull earnings,” 
or prize money, excluding sponsorships. 
The riders aren’t employed, and if 
they can’t hang onto a bull for at least 
eight seconds all weekend, they’re paid 
only a nominal four hundred dollars to 
cover the expense of traveling to the 
tournament. Their independence and 
low pay is a point of pride—Rasmussen 
made a joke the first night about Alex 
Rodriguez’s $32 million salary after the 
Yankee shortstop left men stranded in 
the last game of his team’s season, which
