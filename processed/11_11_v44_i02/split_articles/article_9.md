The Race for 
Ward 1
               POINTS OF DEPARTURE
Susannah Shattuck
This summer, before she announced 
her candidacy for Ward 22 alderwoman, 
Jeanette Morrison went door to door 
in Dixwell, asking her neighbors what 
concerns they had about the community. 
“There’s no jobs,” they told her. But 
from the porches where she stood 
listening, she could see construction 
happening all over neighboring Ward 1 
on Yale’s campus. How could the city 
grant those zoning rights, she wondered, 
without also requiring that some of the 
area’s unemployed residents be trained 
and allowed to work on these projects? 
Only 30 percent of the people employed 
in New Haven are actually from New 
Haven, which, she argues, is “just a 
terrible statistic.” 
With 
unemployment 
rates, 
municipal layoffs, and violent crime 
all 
rising, 
frustrations 
like 
these 
are mounting across the city as the 
November 
8 
election 
approaches. 
“People just want to live decent lives,” 
Morrison said. “There’s something 
wrong.” 
In the September 13 Democratic 
primary elections, New Haven residents 
announced 
that 
they 
want 
new 
representation. Aldermanic candidates 
backed by unions, such as Morrison, 
defeated 
establishment 
candidates, 
many of them incumbents who had 
served for as long as two decades, in 
fourteen out of fifteen hotly contested 
races—despite the fact that many City 
Hall officials took a vacation day for 
last-minute canvassing. It was the first 
time in Mayor John DeStefano, Jr.’s 
tenure that a significant number of 
aldermanic candidates he had endorsed 
were defeated. “The unions kicked ass 
tonight,” DeStefano said at his own 
primary victory party at BAR on Crown 
Street. The same evening, Morrison 
recalled, “I started crying, my mom 
started crying, my friends started crying. 
Like, oh my God!”


The unions had won an important 
victory over the Democratic Party 
establishment, creating a new, dynamic 
moment in New Haven politics. Since 
early summer, DeStefano and local 
unions were assembling rival slates 
of aldermanic candidates. The mayor 
may no longer be able to count on the 
support of the aldermanic council in 
January.


On November 8, students living in 
Ward 1 will vote for a peer to represent 
them on the Board of Aldermen. While 
the labor-establishment division will 
influence the day-to-day responsibilities 
of the new alderman, neither of the 
two candidates—Sarah Eidelson ’12 and 
Vinay Nayak ’14—is officially supported 
by unions or by City Hall, and neither is 
incumbent. 


Though they’re aware of the 
signficance of the primary election, 
Eidelson and Nayak are wary of talking 
candidly about it. They are especially 
reluctant to discuss how tensions may 
affect the Ward 1 race. Certainly, neither 
wants to be categorized as belonging to 
either side. 
“I think that pro-City Hall versus 
anti-City 
Hall 
politics 
is 
entirely 
unproductive 
because 
ultimately 
whoever the aldermen are are going to 
have to work with whoever the mayor 
is,” Nayak said. He said he would be 
an “independent-minded” alderman, 
putting him in the best position to be 
effective because “when you’re less 
concerned about the other political 
dynamics that are going on, like the 
longevity of staying on the board, then 
you’re in a better position to really 
advocate for what you believe in.” 
Eidelson was equally diplomatic. “I 
think that the kind of active democracy 
and engagement happening around the 
city is exactly what we need to move 
forward in a positive direction,” she said, 
“and I think it’s great that people were 
able to elect a lot of new representatives 
who they thought would serve them 
better than their past ones have.” She 
added that the quarreling involved in 
intraparty politics is counterproductive. 
This reasoning may be inspiring, 
but it is also tactful and predictable. 
Whoever is elected to represent Ward 
1 will have to navigate these tensions 
once he or she is on the Board. In fact, 
despite their careful public distance 
from New Haven’s political dichotomy, 
Nayak and Eidelson have already 
inevitably encountered this aspect of 
the city’s politics on their paths to this 
campaign. For now, these histories are all 
constituents have to distinguish the two 
candidates.


As a freshman, Nayak worked as a 
policy assistant to the board’s Community 
Development Committee, where he 
learned about the economic plight of 
small business owners, nonprofits, and 
other community members. Eidelson 
worked with 3-year-olds at Creating 
Kids, a daycare on Wall Street, during 
her freshman year. She has spent the 
past two summers in New Haven. This 
year, Eidelson managed Sarah Saiano’s 
campaign for Ward 18 alderwoman. In 
2010, she ran the Community Voter 
Project at the Connecticut Center for a 
New Economy, a nonprofit organization 
in the city that deals with issues of 
economic justice. She went door-to-
door registering voters in Dwight, 
West River, Dixwell, and Newhallville. 
So, while Nayak has spent more time 
working with the city’s legislative and 
executive branches, Eidelson has spent 
more time in the city at large—talking 
to community members about their 
concerns and working on the campaigns

that led up to last month’s elections.  
The 
candidates’ 
divergent 
experiences have provided them with 
different skill sets and areas of expertise. 
Nayak worked on a committee headed by 
Marcus Paca, Ward 24’s establishment-
backed alderman who was just unseated 
by a union candidate. Eidelson helped 
lead last spring’s “We Are One” rally 
at City Hall, which brought together 
unions and labor rights groups, and the 
campaign she managed this summer was 
for a union-backed candidate. (Saiano 
was the only such candidate to lose 
her race on September 13.) Eidelson 
has personal relationships with Frank 
Douglass, the union-backed candidate 
and Yale dining hall staff member who 
won in Ward 2, and Jeanette Morrison, 
whose campaign she worked on last 
month. Morrison said, “The most 
important thing in local politics are 
relationships and trust, and Sarah has a 
relationship not just with me but with 
different people around New Haven.”


Publicly, the candidates portray 
themselves as being very similar, 
sometimes frustratingly so. The three 
planks of Eidelson’s platform are to 
create a New Haven where “Government 
works for the people,” “No one lives in 
fear” and “All neighborhoods are vibrant 
and inclusive.” Nayak’s points are (with 
the order manipulated for comparison’s 
sake), to “Make government more 
transparent,” “Keep us safe,” and 
“Revitalize our economy.” They both 
want to improve infrastructure, make 
the city’s streets friendlier to bicyclists 
and pedestrians, and strengthen prisoner 
re-entry programs. Each promises to be 
an accessible presence on campus.


When pressed, the candidates have 
found a convenient, respectful way of 
distinguishing 
themselves. 
Eidelson, 
a senior, says she’s “the most in touch 
with Yale students because of how 
much experience I have working with 
them already to make the changes that 
they want to see.” Nayak, a sophomore, 
points out that while Eidelson will 
graduate soon, he will be a student for 
the next two years, making him “able to 
be accessible to and interact with kids in 
the Yale community to work together on 
the solutions.” 


Their approaches to policy do vary, 
however. Nayak is extremely detailed 
and on point. When asked the same 
open-ended questions as Eidelson 
in an interview on policy matters, he 
spoke for more than three times as long. 
Hyperspecific, downloadable reports—
ready to be submitted to the board if 
he’s elected—have been on his website 
for months. He punctuates conversation 
and op-eds with appeals to refer to his 
website. Eidelson is less talkative when 
it comes to policy and has only uploaded 
some comparatively concise policy 
points to her site this month.


difference 
between 
the 
candidates is clear in their approaches 
to community policing. Both candidates 
think it’s important that the police 
department engage with residents, but 
they would execute this goal differently. 
Nayak says that his campaign is based 
on “realistic conversations [I’ve] had 
with people on the Board as well as 
people in City Hall, as far as what we 
could reasonably get done.” While he 
believes that the city should have more 
community-centered policing, he says 
it’s an internal matter for the police 
department to address. He would rather 
focus on “real solutions that the Board 
of Aldermen actually has jurisdiction 
over.” 
Eidelson said that a return to 
community-centered policing was a 
priority. Faced with the question of 
jurisdiction over policing, she brought up 
charter reform, the review and revision 
of the city government’s constitution 
completed by the Board every five years. 
(Charter reform is a favorite subject of 
Eidelson’s; Nayak didn’t mention it in 
an interview.) Currently, Eidelson said, 
the police commission that oversees the 
police department is entirely appointed 
by the mayor. This authority, she said, 
“could shift with charter reform, such 
that the people can have more direct 
power over the police force.” 
Nayak wants to work within the 
system, and Eidelson wants to reform 
it entirely. He’s more pragmatic; she’s a 
bit more romantic. It is not difficult for 
anyone who has talked to the candidates 
to understand the differences between 
them. But these differences are certainly 
not advertised.
