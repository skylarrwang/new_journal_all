he had repeatedly refused in the past 
because the extra money could help pay 
for his tuition. He tried fruitlessly for 
a while to talk his father into keeping 
his job as a machinist. Finally, Michael 
reminded Walter of a story Walter had 
once told him about Walter’s father from 
back when the Frames lived on a farm in 
Rosedale, West Virginia. One morning, 
Walter’s father went out to the corncrib 
to discover that someone had snuck in 
and stolen some of the chicken feed. He 
immediately threw out the lock to the 
crib. When Walter asked why, he said, 
“If someone is desperate enough to 
sneak into our corncrib so he can feed 
his family, I’m not going to stop him.” 
Michael told Walter that he would be 
worse off knowing that his father wasn’t 
doing what he needed to be happy than 
he would be with a little more money for 
tuition; he promised that he’d get by.

Frame went to Union expecting 
to major in physics, but when it came 
time to complete a lab requirement, 
he was dismayed to find that the only 
project available for an undergraduate 
of his experience level was “something 
in biophysics with killing frogs.” He has 
been a vegetarian for as long as he can 
remember (“Burned animals’ muscles—
who thinks that’s a good thing to eat? I 
mean, come on!”), so he switched his 
major to mathematics. He had already 
completed most of the requirements 
anyway. From there, he moved on to 
complete his Ph.D. in mathematics at 
Tulane in 1978 and performed some 
postdoctoral 
research 
at 
Carleton 
University in Ottowa. The only thing he 
liked about Carleton was a hematologist 
who worked at the medical school 
named Jean Maatta, so he married her 
and they both hit the road for the New 
College in Florida. But they didn’t like the 
mosquitoes and moved to Schenectady 
soon after, where Frame was offered a 
teaching position at his alma mater.

He taught calculus and other basic 
math courses until 1988, when SUNY 
Albany announced that they would 
be bestowing Benoit Mandelbrot with 
an honorary degree. Jim Corbett, a 
professor at Albany, planned to deliver 
a brief lecture about fractal basics in 
advance of the ceremony. He couldn’t 
make it, so Frame filled in at the last 
minute. What he didn’t know was 
that Mandelbrot himself would be in 
attendance. He describes the experience 
as “giving a general introduction to the 
ten commandments with Moses in the 
front row.”

He must have done a pretty good 
job, because two years later, when 
Mandelbrot was invited to teach fractal 
geometry at Yale, he enlisted Frame to 
help him write the curriculum. The first 
time the course was offered in 1992 was 
just before the movie “Jurassic Park” 
came out. The film had been adapted 
from a book that ostensibly had to do 
with fractals and chaos theory, and 
everyone was excited about the prospect 
of understanding the science behind 
it. In reality, the book had very little to 
do with chaos theory and the movie 
had even less, aside from a few lines 
delivered by Jeff Goldblum about how 
nature always returns to disorder. That’s 
not really what chaos theory is, but 180 
students signed up for the class anyway. 
Frame has taught it ever since.

Chaos theory, another mathematical 
concept that can be explained through 
fractals, is probably more applicable to 
Frame’s life than it is to dinosaurs. The 
most important aspect of chaos, and 
the one most often misunderstood, 
is sensitivity to initial conditions. The 
long-term future of a chaotic system 
is impossible to predict because even 
imperceptible differences in its initial 
conditions can lead to vastly different 
outcomes. In spatial terms, this means 
that you can never be sure whether 
your starting place is a specific point or 
another point arbitrarily close to that 
point: the two are indistinguishable, 
yet their futures are completely distinct 
from one another. This makes predicting 
the progress of the system as a whole 
impossible. The common example is of 
a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa 
causing a hurricane in North America. A 
more accurate way to put it, according 
to Frame, is that a butterfly flapping its 
wings in Africa makes it impossible to 
predict how, when, or where a hurricane 
will occur in North America because 
every small disturbance in wind patterns 
has the potential to yield a drastically 
different future.

“Chaos has given me a real 
appreciation for unpredictability,” Frame 
says. Who knows what would have 
happened had Jim Corbett not been 
busy on that day in 1988, or if the New 
College had been in a less swampy part 
of Florida, or if Michael Frame’s genetic 
material had come together in a way that 
made him more naturally fit for athletic 
activity? Each moment is a composite 
of untraceable forces leading back to an 
indiscernible initial position. In the case 
of the Frames, some forces are clearer 
than others. Michael had a melanoma 
removed from his ankle in 1983. His 
sister has had breast cancer since 1991, 
and his brother was diagnosed with 
leukemia in 2000. Two years ago, Michael 
was diagnosed with inoperable prostate 
cancer. He thinks unlucky genetics and 
continued exposure to Union Carbide 
chemicals account for the prevalence of 
sickness in his family. Cancer has also 
been one of the reasons why he and 
Jean—whom he calls the only person 
with whom he’s ever had an emotional 
connection—are so close. She has had 
breast cancer for twenty-eight years, 
and they both agreed early on that they 
wouldn’t have any children. He says, 
“The thought of having a child and then 
one or both of us dying while he or she 
was still young was just terrible.”


With regard to himself and his 
siblings, he says, “None of us have the 
sense that this thing is unfair.” He adds, 
“These are just the initial conditions of 
our lives.” For now, things are stable. 
He’s lasted longer than the doctors 
thought he would, and he’s currently 
on a few experimental treatments. He 
has good days and bad days. On the 
weekends, Jean, who now has a job 
in the transplantation center of Yale-
New Haven Hospital, works in her 
vegetable garden. Frame watches her 
through his window or reads books by 
José Saramago, his favorite author. His 
favorite Saramago so far is Death With 
Interruptions, a surreal novel in which 
Death takes a vacation.

One of Frame’s favorite examples 
of self-similarity in art, Salvador Dali’s 
“Face of War,” also has to do with death. 
In the painting, a corpse-like face in a 
barren landscape looks out at the viewer. 
A skull sits in its mouth and in each of 
its eye sockets. Inside each of the skulls’ 
eye sockets and mouths is a skull with 
skulls in its eye sockets and mouth.

One day while sitting in his office, he 
explained to me why he likes it so much. 
“At some point, you can no longer see 
what’s going on in the eyes and mouth,” 
he said. “But you can imagine it.”
