about scale. As a Professor Adjunct in 
the Mathematics Department at Yale 
University, a position he has held since 
1992, he studies fractals—patterns that 
look the same close up as they do far 
away.

The most easily understood fractal 
shape is the Sierpinski Gasket. There are 
many different methods of producing 
the gasket, but the simplest way to 
visualize it is to start with a triangle. If 
you join the midpoints of each of the 
triangle’s sides, you’ll form a smaller 
triangle in the center. Remove that, and 
you end up with three smaller triangles 
surrounding an empty, triangle-shaped 
space. Repeating the process for each 
of these triangles will yield smaller and 
smaller triangles, each of which is part 
of a larger shape, which is in turn part of 
a larger shape. In the theoretical plane, 
this can go on forever, but comparable 
processes happen all the time. Take the 
bronchi in your lungs, each of which 
branches off into bronchioles which 
branch off into bronchioles which 
branch off into bronchioles. Similarly, if 
you look at a coastline, you’ll find that

the erosion patterns that form within the 
stretch of a few feet are analogous to the 
same patterns that occur over a number 
of miles. It’s the same process repeated 
on smaller and smaller scales. The genius 
of it is that the range of its application 
seems limitless, from seashell design to 
planetary formation.

I once asked Frame, “Isn’t it 
overwhelming? I mean, it’s everywhere!”

He frowned. After a moment, he 
said, “Well, no. It’s all just a matter of 
finding a progression of simpler things.”

This is a common theme in how 
Frame sees the world. Someone once 
pointed to a sunflower and said to him, 
“How can you see that and not believe 
in God?” He said, “Easy. I just believe in 
Fibonacci numbers.”

I say, “What about things that can’t 
be explained systematically?”

He says, “I don’t think there’s 
anything 
that 
can’t 
be 
explained 
systematically.”

In addition to working for almost 
twenty years with Benoit Mandelbrot, the 
French mathematician who discovered 
fractals, Frame also teaches MATH 190, 
an introductory course in the subject 
that’s frequently taken by students 
outside the mathematics department 
because the study of fractals is as visual 
as it is analytic.

Mandelbrot 
discovered 
fractals 
while working as a probabilist for IBM 
in the 1960s. He was researching ways 
to predict and prevent problems in the 
way computers transmit information, 
and noticed that errors tended to clump 
together in patterns that looked the 
same whether he analyzed a shorter or 
longer time interval. In other words, the 
data behaved the same on a large scale as 
it did on much smaller ones. He called 
this property self-similarity.

Mandelbrot had been interested in self-
similar structures since the early ’50s, but 
the transmission error problem provided 
him with the right conditions to 
formulate a firmly grounded theory. By 
1975, he had conducted enough research 
to publish Les objets fractal, an explanation 
of how any self-similar pattern could be 
described and replicated using only a few 
metrics.  

Frame believes that there are 
patterns waiting to be recognized almost 
everywhere. If there doesn’t appear to 
be one, it’s probably because we’re not 
asking the right questions. A lot of that 
is probably due to the amount of time 
he spent working with Mandelbrot. 

Often, Mandelbrot, who died last 
October of pancreatic cancer, would 
write down a solution to a problem on 
a piece of paper and say something like, 
“These are the right answers, but can 
you figure out a way to explain them?” 
Frame would take them into his office 
for a day or two, working backwards to 
figure out how Mandelbrot had come 
to his conclusions. Mandelbrot told 
him once that equations came to him in 
visions. Frame’s job for a long time was 
to translate those visions into terms the 
rest of us could understand.

I ask him if he has had any eureka 
moments himself. He says, “I think 
eureka moments are for people with 
forceful personalities.”

Frame’s process is slow and 
deliberate, a fact about which he is 
mercilessly self-deprecating. Mandelbrot 
could look at an image or a problem 
and find a solution within a matter of 
seconds. When Frame wants to solve a 
problem, he’ll write it down and leave it 
on his desk, visiting in for a couple of 
minutes every now and then to squint 
at it until something clicks. He often 
complains he’s the dumbest person 
in the department. He’s proud of his 
teaching, but only insofar as he can 
empathize with students’ bewilderment. 
The trick to good teaching, he says, is “to 
remember what it’s like to not understand 
something. I’m confused about most 
things most of the time, so I recognize 
that look on students’ faces.” Despite 
this, he has worked as a consultant for 
the Department of Energy and the 
Department of Transportation and 
is in the process of designing a new 
set of classes for pre-meds that more 
accurately reflect real problems people 
face in the medical profession. For the 
past twenty years, he’s been working on 
writing a textbook for advanced fractal 
study.

T
he computer in Frame’s office 
is equipped with software that 
analyzes radio frequencies for signs 
of extraterrestrial life. Every few days, 
the data is processed and sent to the 
headquarters of the Search for Extra 
Terrestrial Life Institute. He knows he 
probably won’t find anything, but he 
thinks the idea is “dag-blasted cool.” 
The rest of the office is what you’d 
expect from a math professor: piles of 
loose papers, bulging manila envelopes, a 
board covered with swirling patterns of 
dust from lots of erasing. A cane hangs 
from the chalk ledge. Frame has had to 
use it more and more in the past few 
years as his strength has deteriorated. 
He is small, and he looks smaller when 
he’s seated behind his huge desktop 
monitor. His hair is white, receding, 
and closely cropped. An unruly beard 
of multidirectional hairs extends down 
his neck. His glasses are big and thick; 
they make him look a little like WALL-E, 
the trash-compacting robot from the 
Disney-Pixar film.

Frame was born in 1951 to Walter 
and Mary Arrowood Frame. Even though 
she made more money than Walter did, 
Mary quit her job as an executive at 
a local bank so she could stay home 
with Michael and his younger siblings, 
Steven and Linda. Walter was a gifted 
millwright. He loved his job because he 
loved using his hands, but he often had 
to work long shifts at odd hours. Every 
third week he would work the night shift, 
and everyone in the house would have to 
be very quiet during the day so he could 
sleep. Frame remembers sitting outside 
on the porch wrapped in a blanket while 
a thunderstorm raged overhead, waiting 
for his dad to come home. Every night, 
Walter would peel apples for the family 
while Mary read stories from a Hans 
Christian Andersen book.

At the time, St. Albans was just 
on the edge of rural West Virginia, and 
finding things to do was a challenge. (“A 
lot of kids were athletes, but obviously 
not me,” Frame says with a smirk.) 
Michael became interested in the natural 
world. He made hot air balloons and 
mixed homemade gunpowder with 
moonshine 
from 
his 
grandfather’s 
general store to create model rockets. 
One year for his birthday, his uncle gave 
him a telescope. He still remembers 
being able to make out the craters on 
the moon and, just barely, the rings of 
Saturn.

Michael was the first member of 
his family to go to college. His parents 
couldn’t afford the tuition, but the 
Frames have a history of doing what’s 
important first and worrying about 
logistics later. Walter himself ran away 
from home at sixteen to join the Navy. 
He lied to the recruiter about his age 
and started working as a repairman in 
the Pacific fleet, where he discovered his 
love for machinery. Frame remembers 
that soon after he was accepted into 
Union College, his father told him he 
was going to accept the foreman’s job
