D
ear Colleague: 
Education has long been recognized 
as the great equalizer in America. 
The U.S. Department of  Education and its 
Office for Civil Rights believe that providing all 
students with an educational environment free 
from discrimination is extremely important.

Thus began the letter sent to 
colleges around the country on April 4 by 
the Office for Civil Rights of the federal 
Department of Education. Nineteen 
pages long, it expressed concerns about 
national statistics on sexual violence in 
institutions of higher education and 
outlined the responsibilities of these 
colleges and universities, under Title 
IX of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act, to take “immediate and 
effective steps to end sexual harassment 
and sexual violence.”

In recent years, the Office for 
Civil Rights has issued similar advisory 
letters 
regarding 
bullying, 
gender 
discrimination 
in 
collegiate 
sports, 
and single-sex education. But Jim 
Bradshaw, a Department of Education 
spokesman, noted that this was the 
first time an administration has ever 
issued guidance specifically dealing with 
sexual violence. April’s letter is also 
unprecedented in mandating specific 
policies. “Dear Colleague” letters in the 
past have left details to the discretion 
of individual schools. But this time, the 
Office for Civil Rights is requiring that 
administrators include specific language 
in student codes of conduct. The letter 
also stipulates what some worry is a low 
standard of evidence that could lead to 
wrongful punishments in sexual assault 
cases. Universities must comply or else 
they could face litigation or lose federal 
funding.

The letter covers everything from 
disciplinary procedures to freshman 
education 
programs, 
emphasizing 
respect and protection for victims and 
transparency on policies and programs. 
The obligations discussed in the letter 
also apply to secondary schools.

The Dear Colleague letter is not 
surprising in light of the many cases 
of collegiate sexual violence that have 
made the news in recent years. At 
Arizona State University, a rape survivor 
successfully sued the school under Title 
IX in 2006 for allowing her attacker, a 
football player, to return to campus 
after dismissing him for prior sexual 
misconduct. A woman at the University 
of Colorado won a Title IX suit in 2007, 
receiving a $2.5 million settlement from 
the university after proving it had failed 
to address a hostile sexual environment 
that led to her rape. Eastern Michigan 
University was fined $357,000 by the

Under Title IX, the Obama administration has 
mandated ambitious reforms at universities 
nationwide to combat sexual violence.
