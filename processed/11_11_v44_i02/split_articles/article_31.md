Working Definition
Yale tries for a second time to establish 
a program for researching and studying 
the hatred of Jews in the 
contemporary world.

CRITICAL ANGLE               
P
rofessor Maurice Samuels took 
the podium and sighed. “As many 
of you know,” he said, “this has 
not been an easy summer.” To me, it 
didn’t look like those in attendance—
faculty members, elderly New Haven 
couples, and a few undergraduates 
informed of the lecture through the 
Directed Studies program or the Polish 
Club—had found their way to the 
Wall Street auditorium on the heels of 
controversy. That September afternoon 
in Yale University’s Whitney Humanities 
Center, 
Samuels 
was 
introducing 
Princeton history professor Jan Gross, 
who would give a lecture called “On the 
Periphery of the Holocaust: Killing and 
Plunder of Jews by their Neighbors.” 


Samuels’s words were a reminder of the 
fierce debate surrounding his program, 
which made the afternoon’s talk unusual 
among the enormous number of 
department-sponsored lectures on Yale’s 
campus. 
“Professors of nineteenth-century 
literature like myself aren’t usually 
accustomed to the media spotlight,” 
Samuels said. “And I have to admit 
that I was somewhat taken aback by 
the vehemence of the critics I faced on 
both sides of the political spectrum, and 
before I had even done anything.”
What occurred over this past 
summer was, on its surface, little more 
than a bureaucratic shift in the Yale 
academic machine: the Yale Institute 
for the Interdisciplinary Study of 
Antisemitism 
(YIISA, 
pronounced 
“yee-suh”) was shut down and replaced 
almost immediately by the Yale Program 
for the Study of Antisemitism (YPSA, 
“yip-suh”). 
Acronyms 
change, faculty shift their affiliations 
with various boards and institutes: so 
the seasons pass in academia. “YPSA 
will discuss both contemporary anti-
Semitism and historical anti-Semitism,” 
said Samuels, who had just been 
appointed director of the fledgling 
YPSA, in a June 21 statement. “Like 
many, I am concerned by the recent 
upsurge in violence against Jews around 
the world and YPSA will address these 
concerns. I also believe that we benefit 
a great deal by placing current events 
into historical context. YPSA will not 
refrain from exploring any controversial 
contemporary topic.” 
This carefully worded statement 
wasn’t enough to stop the public from 
reacting with ire to the transition. 
Commentators accused Yale of hushing 
dialogue on what former YIISA director 
Charles Small called a “current crisis 
facing Jews” and focusing instead on 
the more politically neutral study of 
historical anti-Semitism. The verb “kill” 
occurred frequently in columns about 
YIISA’s closing. In Slate, in the Wall Street 
Journal, and in many Jewish publications, 
critics accused Yale of allowing leftist 
political sympathies to stifle scholarship 
exposing Muslim anti-Semitism. David 
Greenberg, writing for Slate in July, 
posed a charged question: “How did 
liberalism—historically the philosophy 
of toleration and equal rights—come to 
be so squeamish about confronting Jew-
hatred in its contemporary forms?” 
Jew-hatred. I have a very vivid 
memory of being six years old and 
worrying that a neo-Nazi was going 
to kill my mother. In Illinois, a lawyer 
named Matthew Hale was preaching 
white supremacy and one of his 
followers had shot several Jews walking 
to their synagogue in Chicago. So, 
running errands with my mom, I would 
cross my arms over my chest in a way 
that would cover up the word “Jewish” 
on my Jewish Community Center 
summer camp T-shirt—that way, the 
white supremacists we encountered 
wouldn’t know it was us they should be 
shooting. We never did run into one—
or, if we did, my trick worked, and we 
survived. Around that time, the Ku Klux 
Klan staged a march in my home city, 
Pittsburgh. They were met by protests, 
which my mother and older siblings 
attended. I was not allowed to go. I was 
very disappointed at being denied the 
chance to gawk firsthand at the hooded 
anti-Semites: an exotic, dying species of 
bigot which I had so often heard about 
but never met. 
In Hebrew school, and eventually, 
in public school, I learned about Hitler, 
Kristallnacht, the Nuremburg Laws, and 
Auschwitz. At 12, I watched Schindler’s 
List and visited the Holocaust Museum 
in Washington, D.C. What made these 
history lessons different from others 
was their ominous refrain: It could happen 
again. Anti-Semitism was a disease that 
could appear dormant but break out 
when least expected, and it was our 
duty as Jews to be vigilant. Before the 
Democratic primaries for the 2004 
presidential election, a Sunday school 
teacher told me that he would move to 
Israel were Joe Lieberman ’64 elected 
president. “If the terrorists attack again, 
people will blame the president, and 
then blame the Jews.” 
He left the rest up to my 
imagination, but by that point I was 
already growing skeptical of what in my 
view was a kind of paranoia. For all the 
Holocaust films I watched, I couldn’t 
make the connection between Germany 
in 1938 and the United States in 2004. 
Lieberman didn’t win the primary, so my 
teacher’s theory was never tested, but I 
felt sure anyway that it was unfounded. 
The Klan never came back to town. I 
came to Yale, where, just like everywhere, 
some people have funny opinions about 
Jews, but where, just like anywhere, I 
have yet to meet a real anti-Semite. I 
thought I’d left the fear of my childhood 
behind for maturity and rationality. And 
before the events of this summer, I was 
used to shrugging off criticisms of the 
American university as a stronghold of 
leftist politics. So what if my history 
professor is a self-avowed Marxist? 
Where else was I going to meet one? 
The greatest 
challenge of 
researching 
anti-Semitism 
is not 
labeling and 
cataloguing 
offensive acts 
but asking the 
essential 
question: 
“Why does man 
hate?”


I was nonplussed by accusations 
this summer that a historically anti-
Semitic university was hushing a group 
of academics simply because their ideas 
were unpalatable to the University’s 
liberal supporters. When editorials 
called for “not another Jewish dime 
to Yale,” I couldn’t comprehend the 
uproar. Why was the media so up in 
arms, especially when another program 
to study anti-Semitism was going to take 
YIISA’s place? As I talked to different 
scholars in the field, I began to think 
that these visceral reactions to YIISA’s 
closing reflected the same problematic 
assumptions that lay underneath the old 
institute’s research.

T
he 
foundation 
of 
YIISA’s 
scholarship was the concept of 
“New Antisemitism,” which scholars 
define as the latest incarnation of 
an ancient prejudice which focuses 
primarily on demonization of the State 
of Israel. Alvin Rosenfeld, director of 
the Institute for the Contemporary Study 
of Anti-Semitism at Indiana University, 
Bloomington, traced for me the historical 
evolution of anti-Semitism, from the 
religious anti-Semitism that accused 
Jews of Christ’s death, to the racial anti-
Semitism that laid the groundwork for 
the Holocaust, to the modern political 
anti-Semitism targeting Israel. 
“The fact is that we are living in 
a time when there is much too much 
hostility to Jews and the Jewish state,” 
Rosenfeld told me. “And by the latter I 
don’t mean criticism of Israeli policies 
that someone might object to on 
legitimate grounds, but the need to call 
into question the legitimacy of the state 
and its future. When [Israel’s critics] 
use Nazi language to compare the state 
of Israel to the Third Reich, or South 
African language to compare the State 
of Israel to apartheid South Africa, that 
is something else, and I have no problem 
calling that something else anti-Semitic.” 
Rosenfeld referred me to a working 
definition of anti-Semitism accepted by 
the European Monitoring Centre for 
Racism and Xenophobia. The definition, 
which is used by the Indiana institute 
and appeared in a 2008 Congressional 
report on global anti-Semitism, provides 
examples of anti-Zionist rhetoric which 
is also anti-Semitic: “Denying the Jewish 
people their right to self-determination... 
by claiming that the existence of a 
State of Israel is a racist endeavor” and 
“Applying double standards by requiring 
of [Israel] a behavior not expected or 
demanded of any other democratic 
nation.” 
I can see where Rosenfeld is coming 
from. What is going on in the Palestinian 
Territories, for all of its ugliness, is 
not equivalent to the Nazi Holocaust. 
Making that comparison is alienating 
and unproductive. I feel queasy when 
a friend dismissively asks, “You’re not 
doing that Birthright thing, are you?” I 
imagine that many Jews, both my age and 
older, and of all political persuasions, 
also suspect that anti-Zionism stems 
from a particularly sticky form of anti-
Semitism. But intellectually, I know the 
issue is sometimes more complicated. 
Those entrusted with studying anti-
Semitism should think deeply about 
these complexities. My major issue 
with scholarship on New Antisemitism, 
of which YIISA was a prime example, 
is its insistence that large swathes of 
potentially useful or revealing ideas are 
anti-Semitic and therefore deserve no 
serious discussion in academia.
Take, for example, the South 
Africa-inspired strategy of Boycott, 
Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel 
as a means of ending the occupation 
of the Palestinian Territories. Critically 
analyzing the BDS movement instead of 
dismissing it immediately as anti-Semitic 
would be alarming to many scholars 
who subscribe to the doctrine of New 
Antisemitism, because it compares 
Israel to a historically racist state. In a 
2006 paper for the American Jewish 
Committee, Alvin Rosenfeld wrote 
that “progressive” Jews who promote 
discussion of the BDS movement are 
“profoundly wrong. Such thinking is 
also harmful in its likely effects, for in 
calling into question Israel’s legitimacy 
and moral standing, it abets the views 
of those who demand an end to Jewish 
national existence altogether and lends 
a coveted aura of Jewish support to 
the advancement of this eliminationist 
goal.” 
Rosenfeld avoids exploring the 
premises of the movement he criticizes. 
Similarly, I wouldn’t have dared to 
discuss the reasoning behind Boycott, 
Divestment, and Sanctions in my 
Hebrew school classroom. But Yale 
is not a Hebrew school classroom. 
Dogmatic restrictions on studying anti-
Semitism put seriously considering the 
reasons for anti-Zionism on the same 
moral level as crediting the claims of 
Holocaust deniers. The truth is that the 
failure to distinguish between the two 
also makes me queasy. 
Yaman Salahi, a soft-spoken third-
year law student, contributed an op-ed 
to the News last fall criticizing the old 
YIISA before its closure. Instead of 
attempting to place anti-Semitism in the 
context of other forms of hatred, Salahi 
wrote, speakers at a YIISA conference 
focused conspicuously on Muslim and 
Arab anti-Semitism. Scholarship at 
YIISA, Salahi told me, reflected “a body 
of knowledge out there which is saying: 
‘O.K., who is criticizing Israel right now? 
Let’s find out how to make them anti-
Semitic.” This dogma was what led to 
the closing of YIISA: its research was 
So what if my 
history 
professor is 
a self-avowed 
Marxist? Where 
else was I 
going to meet 
one?
