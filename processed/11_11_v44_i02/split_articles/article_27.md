environmental 
assessment 
examines 
using the sludge to construct islands, 
blending it into cement, and turning 
the waste into landscaping soil after 
treatment, and they are all too expensive. 
B
arbara Blumeris, a planner for the 
Army Corps, is frustrated. “It’s just 
a hole,” she says. Blumeris and Keegan 
haven’t yet finished presenting their 
proposal to the residents of Morris 
Cove, but their audience refuses to 
cooperate. It is April 2010, and at the 
first of two required public hearings, the 
Covers have arrived with angry posters 
and pointed questions. 
Claudia Bosch, a Cover since 2003, 
has armed her daughter for the hearing 
with a sign nearly as large as the five-year-
old that reads “No Toxic Carcinogenic 
Sludge in Morris Cove!”
A few weeks earlier, Bosch, a stay-
at-home mom, took a call from a friend 
in her small, bright house on Townsend 
Avenue, two blocks from the ocean. 
Ward 18 Alderman Alyne Depino was 
going door-to-door, Bosch’s friend said, 
asking neighbors to attend a public 
hearing about a waste disposal project in 
the cove.
“Initially, I did not want to go,” 
Bosch says. “I thought, ‘Oh, it’s going 
to be all right.’” But then she read the 
proposal online. Bosch was alarmed 
not only by the long list of toxins in the 
sludge and the nine-month period for 
which it would lie uncovered, but also 
by the way the writers of the document 
seemed unaware of important details 
about Morris Cove. Though Morris 
Cove is in New Haven, it shares a zip 
code with East Haven, she explained, 
and the Army Corps’s proposal used 
East Haven demographic data. “When 
you don’t get right which community is 
where,” she wondered, “what else are 
you not getting right?”
She began trawling for more 
information online. First she pulled 
all the surveys and data related to the 
Bridgeport project. She found a chart 
with a skull printed by the materials to 
be placed in open water. “I just had to 
chuckle,” she says. She felt that if the 
waste deemed suitable for open water 
disposal got a single skull, the Morris 
Cove mud should get three. She found 
the Army Corps’s report on its use of 
Morris Cove’s pit for the disposal of 
materials from a comparatively small 
New Haven Coast Guard Station 
dredging in 2000. The report concludes, 
“It is recommended that the borrow pit 
continue to be used for the placement of 
small to moderate volumes of sediment 
deemed suitable for unconfined open 
water disposal.” Bosch sees the current 
plan as a reversal. “Now it’s the placement 
of a large volume of sediment deemed 
unsuitable and the question is, what 
made you change that?” she says, raising 
her voice. “When you haven’t even done 
your homework!”
That 
study 
also 
reveals 
that 
midwinter ice and high winds delayed 
the completion of the dumping from 
the Coast Guard station, suggesting that 
future contaminated waste may have to 
sit uncapped longer than anticipated. 
The Army Corps would have to abandon 
Morris Cove work in February, whether 
the dumping had been completed or not, 
because the cove is one of few places 
where the winter flounder spawns. 
If weather interferes with transport 
between Bridgeport and New Haven 
and the dumping is postponed, the 
waste may remain uncapped for another 
season in addition to the required nine-
month settling period.
Bosch eventually collected reports 
on CAD cell use from as far afield as 
Rotterdam, yet of all the data she found, 
her favorite statistic is one provided 
by the Army Corps itself. During the 
nine-month settling period at least one 
percent of the contaminants will remain 
suspended in the water surrounding 
the waste deposit, even in the best-case 
scenario. Bosch worried about that one 
percent. Her children swim in that water. 
At the April meeting, she and the 
other Covers ask Keegan and Blumeris: 
would the Army Corps inadvertently 
poison them? The Army Corps’s 
representatives answer as best they 
can, referring to their slides once more. 
The meeting ends. The Covers are left 
feeling uneasy and angry. But they know 
a second public hearing is still to come. 
A 
year and a half later, Bosch explains 
her reaction to that night and the 
moment when Blumeris muttered, “It’s 
just a hole.” Bosch says, “That attitude, 
‘We know how nature works, we have 
everything under control,’—that makes 
me very uneasy.” She speaks more 
quietly than normal, feeling her way 
through her thoughts. That confidence, 
which she calls “arrogance,” reminds her 
of the disastrous failure of the levees in 
New Orleans six years ago. 
“We have everything under control 
because we did those little studies in the 
laboratory,” she says ironically.
Five 
months 
after 
the 
April 
meeting, Bosch’s friend and neighbor 
Ben Northrup asked her to drive to 
Bridgeport with him for that city’s public 
meeting with the Army Corps. It would 
be a tedious way to spend an evening, 
but it would prove they were serious, 
Northrup thought. So he and Bosch sat 
in a University of Bridgeport recital hall 
and watched the same presentation from 
a half a year earlier. The Army Corps had

pointed questions would be needed to 
stop the dumping. That was when the 
organization New Haven Protecting 
Our Water!, or NHPOWer!, was born. 
“When I came home the same night 
I knew we had to do something—I 
started mobilizing friends,” Bosch says. 
Their first goal was to convince the 
Army Corps to return to the Cove for a 
proper hearing.
The Army Corps came back to 
New Haven in late October, armed with 
a slideshow to explain their reasoning 
to the 120 residents in attendance. The 
explanation of why PCBs wouldn’t 
contaminate the cove consisted of a 
single bullet point: “- contaminants 
largely remain on sediment.” The Army 
Corps presented a series of graphs 
illustrating how Bridgeport’s levels of 
PCBs were much lower than those of 
many other New England ports. The 
graphs also showed that Bridgeport’s 
harbor has a concentration of the toxic 
particles that, between 100 and 560 
particles per billion, is three times as 
high as New Haven’s (which is less than 
190 ppb) and is highly contaminated 
(fish sold over state lines aren’t allowed 
to have a concentration higher than 2 
ppb).
Toward the end of his presentation, 
Keegan pulled up a two-tone graphic. It 
showed a house, a slope, the water line, 
and a trench, and, swooping down under 
them, an arrow, curled like the top half 
of a re-curved bow, to represent the 
downward flow of water into Morris 
Cove. No land infiltration of the toxic 
waste would occur, the Corps explained, 
because of gravity. “It’s a matter of 
physics… Water doesn’t flow uphill,” 
Keegan explains a year later. Bosch 
thought the image might make sense for 
Nathan Hale School, a mile up from the 
Cove on Forbes bluff, where the meeting 
was being held. But the houses in her 
neighborhood, down the hill, all collect 
sand in their backyards, and the residents 
use sump pumps to keep basements dry 
during heavy rains. 
As Bosch recalls, the engineers 
dropped lead into a container of water 
to show that it would settle to the 
bottom. “Then a Cover asked, ‘Are you 
aware that your model might not be 
not revised it to address contaminant 
infiltration in Morris Cove. Afterward, 
Bosch approached Keegan and asked 
when the second required public hearing 
would take place. Keegan told her it just 
had.
Bosch decided then that she had 
been participating only in the illusion 
of public discourse. She says she saw 
that the Corps was fully committed 
to the Morris Cove version of the 
dredging plan and was not prepared to 
make changes in response to the 
citizens’ views. More force than a few

the reality here? Because there is the 
seawall.’” Seawalls reflect the energy of 
waves back into the sea, meaning each 
tide shifts more sediment.
“Which wall?” Barbara Blumeris 
asked in response. The Morris Cove 
residents were stunned. They felt as if 
they’d fallen off the map of sensible 
procedure. Some Covers laughed—had 
the engineers ever even visited the site? 
they wondered.
Bosch decided that they hadn’t. 
Indeed, the Army Corps’s 154-page 
assessment does not mention the 
seawall. The entire document addresses 
Morris Cove very little. A single sentence 
classifies the water quality of the cove as 
severely polluted, contradicting another 
Army Corps study from 2000 that states 
the cove is far cleaner than Bridgeport 
Harbor. 
That was that. The Army Corps 
of Engineers, Bosch and NHPOWer! 
concluded, could not be trusted.
“W
hat about a vigilante midnight 
hole-filling party?” A few 
people laugh, but the woman who spoke 
sounds maybe a bit too enthusiastic. 
Someone else suggests, sarcastically, 
inviting the Army Corps to an oyster 
bake with the CAD cell shellfish. 
The eight attendees of a NHPOWer! 
meeting October 4 sit above the Morris 
Cove fire station’s garage, facing Bosch 
and Northrup, the group’s acting heads. 
The group is planning its next steps. 
Last fall, NHPOWer! won both 
media and political attention. Bosch 
jokes that the only elected official whose 
support they’ve yet to win is President 
Barack Obama. But these pledges 
of support have yet to produce any 
new law that would block the Army 
Corps. Members of NHPOWer! fear 
that budgetary constraints may make 
these 
politicians’ 
promises 
brittle. 
Besides, it isn’t elected officials, but the 
Connecticut Department of Energy and 
Environmental Protection, or DEEP, 
that will approve or reject the Army 
Corps’s plans. 
The Army Corps only needs two 
things before proceeding with the 
dredging and disposal: funding from 
Congress and approval from DEEP. 
Funding, Keegan says, is two years away 
at best. Between the fiscal years of 2010 
and 2012, the Army Corps’ overall budget 
will decrease by more than $900 million. 
Keegan does not seem concerned about 
receiving DEEP approval. The Army 
Corps and DEEP often work together, 
and 
state 
representatives 
attended 
the informational meetings. Sheiffele, 
though, is not as confident. DEEP
