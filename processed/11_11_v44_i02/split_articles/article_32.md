sometimes unscholarly, its speakers 
oftentimes uncritically pro-Israel in 
their rhetoric, and the institution itself 
ultimately undesirable at Yale.  
Wondering about the possibility of 
alternatives to New Antisemitism, I got 
in touch with Jonathan Judaken, an anti-
Semitism scholar at Rhodes College in 
Memphis. In an email, Judaken stressed 
that the academy should not shy away 
from politically charged scholarship, 
as long as the research being produced 
is innovative. If controversial and 
opinionated scholars “have insights that 
challenge conventions not already an 
important part of the public debate,” he 
wrote, “then either perspective should be 
voiced in the academy. There is no better 
site in our culture for voicing the most 
difficult or dangerous ideas because the 
academy actually has tools and criteria 
for judging such issues.” Difficult and 
dangerous ideas might include not only 
questioning specific Israeli policies, but 
also the fundamental doctrines that 
tangible solutions. It can be frustrating to 
hear a professor such as Samuels suggest 
that scholarship must take care not to 
cross the line into activism. “Scholars 
can help define anti-Semitism; they 
can map its contours; they can explain 
its manifestations,” Samuels, YPSA’s 
embattled figurehead, told me. “This 
is not to say that scholars cannot have 
opinions, or take sides on issues.  But the 
work of the scholar is different from the 
work of the advocate.” 

Both Rosenfeld and Judaken will 
be coming to Yale this year to speak at 
YPSA events. Rosenfeld’s lecture is titled 
“Sources of the ‘New Antisemitism’” 
and Judaken will talk about “Theorizing 
the Study of Antisemitism.” No theory 
about anti-Semitism or the state of Israel 
will ever be politically neutral, but from 
the list of speakers and their lecture 
topics, I can surmise that the range of 
views expressed at YPSA will be wider 
than that of its predecessor, and I feel 
that YPSA is in good hands. My hope 
that its scholars do take an activist stance, 
though not in support of or opposition 
to any nation-state. Instead, I’d like to 
see YPSA advocate and be a model for 
a more open and heterogenous academy, 
where scholars argue new ideas in front 
of a critical audience instead of preaching 
established theories to a complacent 
choir. As easy at it is to ignore Yale’s 
seemingly esoteric academic turmoil, 
as students we are right in the middle 
of it. It’s hard to say which ideas will 
make their way out of the ivory tower, 
where we are safe to appreciate their 
complexity, but we can’t wait until they 
enter the world of politics and sound 
bites to start paying attention.
underlie them—even if this means 
doing away with the restrictions of the 
New Antisemitism school.
I 
don’t think it’s controversial to say that 
all scholars of anti-Semitism think 
it is a problem that a small American 
child fears for his Jewish life at the end 
of the twentieth century, whether they 
call the problem New Antisemitism 
or something else. But the greatest 
challenge of researching anti-Semitism 
is not labeling and cataloguing offensive 
acts but asking the essential question: 
“Why does man hate?” It is a frustrating 
question, partly because it has no 
definitive or universal answer, and partly 
because it’s hard to see how any answer 
could stop Iranian newspapers from 
publishing hateful cartoons or untangle 
the knot in my stomach I feel when 
my friends criticize Israel. Academic 
research, no matter how contrarian, 
can feel inadequate when there are so 
many problems in the world that require
