The Tinkerers
Apprentices at the Eli Whitney Museum 
learn to work with their hands.
By Sophia Nguyen
9-year-old boys whose teachers wanted 
them “tamed.” But to Brown, their 
misbehavior was not the real problem. 
“Being the smartest kid in the school 
is the problem,” he says. “This is a 
fairly common paradox, where natural 
mechanics are told that they’re losers. 
They’ve never been told, ‘You are 
magical at this.’” 

Through his work at the Eli Whitney 
Museum and Workshop, Brown tries 
to reach those with a different kind of 
intelligence, “people who see big pictures 
so intricate that English is inadequate” to 
describe them. Over the course of our 
conversation, he talks about accountants, 
religious mystics, dyslexics, and origami 
artists, saying, “They’re fascinated by 
intricacies, while other kids are caught 
up in the thematic lines of the Smurfs.” 
According to him, these are students 
who can’t sit still in a classroom, but 
become utterly absorbed by imagining 
esoteric mechanical processes.

Various treasures rest here and 
there in the museum staff offices: a set

of wooden elephants, a metal acrobat 
held up by spindly limbs, other personal 
tokens from beloved students. There’s a 
large wooden worktable at the back and 
rows of plastic tubs filled with model 
boats and houses. They’re products of 
the museum’s workshop, which I visited 
on a Sunday in September when it was 
humming with activity. In uniforms 
of red t-shirts and safety goggles, high 
school-age apprentices sand surfaces 
and bore holes, cutting once and 
measuring twice. Amidst the sawdust 
and clamor, their seriousness of purpose 
and brisk competence, there are snatches 
of color: the red of their shirts, the aqua 
of a boy’s dyed hair, the wooden cat 
dolls being painted by a birthday party 
of younger children. The apprentices’ 
productivity is totally unlike the way I 
work as a Yale student. They are busy 
without being harried, focusing on their 
tasks with attention that isn’t scattered 
by multitasking. Everyone is utterly 
absorbed in their given duty. 

The museum staff runs this 
apprenticeship program for students 
ages 13 through 18 in addition to offering 
workshops and visiting classrooms in 
schools. The apprentices, nicknamed 
“redshirts,” work at the museum for 
approximately five hours a week during 
the school year, and longer over summer 
vacations. In exchange, they receive 
a stipend and considerable training, 
and become involved in all of the 
museum’s operations. They master tools, 
assemble kits, and conduct workshops 
with visitors, eventually designing their 
own projects to add to the museum’s 
collection. 

Brown and the museum staff 
constantly emphasize the importance 
of experimentation. They’re believers 
in the serious business of tinkering, 
and in the generative qualities of what 
most would call play. When they visit 
a classroom, it becomes a much more 
open space. However briefly, the work 
can present students with new and 
tangible 
challenges—challenges 
that 
occur in real time, with specific shapes 
and demonstrable consequences. This 
kind of challenge can only arise while 
working with your hands towards a 
particular goal: turning a wheel, igniting 
a spark.

T
he Eli Whitney Museum and 
Workshop collects “experiments.” 
Established in 1979, the red brick 
building on Whitney Avenue is located 
on the site of Eli Whitney’s historic 
factory in Hamden, which introduced 
mass production to the United States. 
Whitney was the first to give each worker 
a specific task in the manufacturing 
process. The image of his factory is 
well-known from history textbooks 
containing William Gyles Munson’s 
idyllic painting “The Eli Whitney Gun 
Factory.”

The museum outside the workshop 
is quieter. Here, exhibits are sectioned 
off in their own domain. A glassed-in 
model of the old factory stands silent. 
Waiting to be illuminated by the push of 
a button, miniature workers are frozen in 
their labor, each bending to his assigned 
task, forever striving towards their boss’s 
dream of uniform production.

The apprentices in the museum’s 
workshop, by contrast, are in constant 
motion. As Brown leads me on a tour 
he calls our “walking interview,” some 
of the teenagers stop us to ask him 
questions. They politely ignore my 
blank stares that betray an inability to 
visualize the dimensions they discuss, 
the screws and braces they name, and 
the difficulties they’ve encountered in 
building. They have developed a friendly 
but impenetrable jargon precisely for 
this space.

“I’ll be okay if we don’t finish the 
balancing circuses today,” Brown tells 
one student. “But we should finish the 
boats.”

Brown referred to two of the 
workshop’s projects. Where the workers 
of the old factory once built guns, 
the seven full-time staff and seventy-
five apprentices now manufacture kits 
containing the materials for models and 
science experiments—seventy thousand 
a year. These kits are designed to teach 
science concepts to younger students, 
ranging from kindergarten to the eighth 
grade. The kits and the museum’s 
accompanying educational programs 
bring in approximately one million 
dollars annually, comprising 72 percent 
of the organization’s revenue. Other 
sources of income include the field 
trips that educators from the museum 
make to public and private schools in 
Connecticut and New York to conduct 
workshops in classrooms. The museum 
also earns money from visitors, usually 
families with young children, who 
assemble projects together on weekends 
or come in for birthday parties. Many 
attend the special programs held during 
school vacations, weaving scarves over 
winter break and designing tests for 
superhero-themed crash dummies over 
the summer. The rest of the museum’s 
revenue comes from First Factory 
products, projects sold wholesale to 
summer camps or local teachers.

These projects are the museum’s 
educational mission in a box. Designed 
to fulfill Connecticut standards for 
science curricula from kindergarten 
through eighth grade, each is intended to 
be easily completed in a classroom and 
to promote engagement with concepts 
through physical contact with materials. 
To learn about electricity, students build 
Unless they’re given 
this tacit license 
to explore, kids 
will churn out 
replicas utterly 
indistinguishable 
from the model, 
following directions 
and learning little.
