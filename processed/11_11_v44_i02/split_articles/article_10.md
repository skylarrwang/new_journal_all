Balkanization
It was the end of the 1970s in 
Washington, D.C., and nobody was 
buying Laine Harris’s falafel. The 
competition was fierce. “I would line 
up with all the other vendors on the 
corner—rug dealers, hash-pipe carts, 
hot-dog carts,” he recalls. When the 
boredom became unbearable, Harris 
started to perform. Raised in Alabama, 
Harris had learned Balkan folk-dancing 
in college, and at his cart he chose a 
Macedonian dance involving fancy 
footwork and towel-twirling. Later, he 
challenged himself further by chanting 
rhymes in time to the music playing 
in his head: “Hot falafel, spinach pie, 
baklava, give ‘em a try. It’s a tasty treat, 
it’s got no meat, so come on by, give it a 
try. Hot falafel and spinach pie.” People 
took notice of him and started flocking 
to his cart. Soon, he said, “I was busy 
enough that I wasn’t dancing and singing 
anymore.”  


Laine Harris and his brother Drew 
have since made their way to New 
Haven, where they’re still dancing, but 
no longer sell falafel. They lead a new 
Balkan jam the first Monday of every 
month at 7 p.m. at Café Nine on State 
Street.


“For those of you trying to have an 
intimate conversation: Well, sorry,” Drew 
announced after they finished a song on 
October 3. Half an hour into the jam’s 
third session, the patrons weren’t paying 
much attention to the music. They sat at 
the back, drinking beer, eating popcorn 
from red plastic baskets, and chatting. 
Most of the applause came from the 
musicians themselves.  


The seven instrumentalists sitting 
or standing in the lee of the stage 
launched into a lively dance tune, the 
melody carried by Drew and another 
saxophonist, who were playing in the 
aggressively nasal style favored in the 
Balkans. On the rotary trumpet, which 
looks vaguely like a horn from the Civil 
War, Laine took care of the harmony, 
keeping pace with the saxes through 
each twist and turn. A tuba player filled 
out the lower register. And beneath it all 
ran a wild river of percussion, from the 
water-like sounds of two darbukas—a 
kind of hand drum played all over the 
Near East—to the cascading booms and 
cracks of the tapan, a Balkan double-
headed bass drum strapped to the front 
of the body and played with a mallet-like 
stick in one hand and a switch in the 
other.  


The song they played had once 
been 
performed 
at 
a 
traditional 
gypsy circumcision party near Ohrid, 
Macedonia. It came to the United States 
on a cassette in the early 1980s, in the 
hands of a musician who played with the 
Harris brothers in the legendary New 
York Balkan brass band Zlatne Uste. 
Laine Harris still plays with Zlatne Uste, 
although Drew left the group to spend 
more time with his family and to focus 
on his job teaching entrepreneurship and 
business strategy at Central Connecticut 
State University. Laine works at a yoga 
center in Hamden.


What first interested the Harris 
brothers in Balkan music was girls. “As 
a shy guy looking for a date, I couldn’t 
just walk across the room to talk to 
someone,” Laine says.  Both brothers 
had taken some ballet classes, and they 
figured that, as straight guys who could 
dance, they might get lucky. So they 
began to attend folk-dance events at their 
college in Pensacola, Florida. “We got 
invited to parties, and we were pleased 
with our results,” Drew told me with a 
laugh. Years later, Laine would meet his 
wife, Jennifer Brosious, in a professional 
Balkan dance troupe in California. 


But while Laine and Drew Harris 
were date-hunting, they got seriously 
hooked on the odd meters and modes 
of Balkan music. Laine remembers 
hearing a recording by Boris Karlov—a 
man referred to as “the legend of the 
Bulgarian accordion”—and thinking 
that “this was not an accordion, this 
was a steam train.” Soon, they had 
put together a band. Their first paying 
gig was a mock Serbian wedding in 
Texas. “It was a three-day weekend, 
the appropriate amount of time for a 
wedding,” Laine said. 


All this was happening in what Drew 
calls “the golden era of folk-dancing 
in America,” which began around the 
late ’60s and was winding down by 
1980.  In that period, a folk dance with 
seventy people was considered small. 
Hundreds of enthusiasts would turn out 
at get-togethers all over North America. 
Dancers who lived in places where 
there wasn’t much of a scene would 
drive hundreds of miles for a weekend 
workshop. The Harris brothers suggest 
that the fascination with Balkan dance 
in particular came from an interest in 
cultures oppressed by Soviet rule and 
a wish to express solidarity with the 
people who lived under it.


In those years, Drew and Laine 
Harris moved from job to job. 
Drew worked as a longshoreman, a 
construction worker, and a windshield 
repairman, while Laine, besides being 
a falafel salesman and folk-dancer, was 
a fireman, a cabinet-maker, and a flight 
instructor. Since then, both brothers 
have settled in the New Haven area, and 
the golden age of folk-dancing has come 
and gone.


But Balkan music is now becoming 
increasingly hip in cities like New York 
and Montreal. On September 24, I heard 
Laine Harris playing with Zlatne Uste 
in the East Village. Since its formation 
In city politics at large, candidates 
don’t understate their differences and 
affiliations—they 
champion 
them. 
Morrison, for example, was proud to 
have served on the executive board of 
her local union. “I like unions!” she said. 
“I work for the State of Connecticut, 
and I’m part of the union.”  Morrison 
supports unions because of what they 
accomplish. “We all believe that the 
people should have a voice,” she said, 
“and that people should be given the 
same opportunities as everyone else.” 
We can hope that a more diverse 
Board of Aldermen will help achieve 
these goals, whatever the outcome of 
the Ward 1 race.
