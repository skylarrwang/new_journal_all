money comes straight from Congress, 
with the exception of a percentage that 
the Bridgeport Port Authority will have 
to raise itself. Use of the Morris Cove 
borrow pit would put two million dollars 
less stress on that organization (which 
has its own financial woes). As it states in 
its draft proposal, the Army Corps must 
find the least expensive, environmentally 
acceptable disposal option. And the 
Corps does make a case for the CAD 
cell improving the marine environment 
in Morris Cove.


The Army Corps classifies the 
Morris Cove dumping as a “beneficial 
use” disposal option. Project manager 
Michael Keegan argues that raising the 
sea floor (though pit won’t be filled 
entirely) would create twenty-four more 
acres of oyster habitat and end the 
seasonal formation of an oxygen-poor 
environment within the pit, which can 
hurt marine life. 


Environmental advocates would 
prefer that neither the Morris Cove CAD 
cell nor a second Bridgeport CAD cell 
were built. The best place to move the 
mud would be inland, says Louis Burch, 
the Connecticut program coordinator for 
Citizens Campaign for the Environment, 
a nonprofit organization with eighty 
thousand members in New York and 
Connecticut. Yet this alternative, which 
would require constructing a treatment 
facility to clean the contaminated waste, 
would make the project fourteen times 
as expensive. Burch also likes the idea 
of using the material productively. The 
Army Corps is using some of New 
York’s dredging waste to restore marsh 
islands in Jamaica Bay off Brooklyn and 
Queens. Many alternatives to dumping 
may never be explored because of 
their cost. The Army Corps’s draft


three times as large as those that can 
currently pass through. 


Water-born freight in the eastern 
United States will increase dramatically 
over the next ten years, says Judi 
Sheiffele, executive director of the New 
Haven Port Authority. “The trucks won’t 
be on I-95, they’ll come by water,” she 
says. Sheiffele predicts that a few ports, 
perhaps Virginia’s Norfolk, whose 
channels are fifty feet deep, and the 
New York and Newark harbor, where 
the Army Corps is in the middle of a 
major dredging project, will become 
hubs in a new marine highway system. 
Connecticut’s ports, however, aren’t in 
any condition to take advantage of the 
increase in maritime activity. 


Traffic in all three of Connecticut’s 
deepwater 
ports—Bridgeport, 
New 
Haven, 
and 
London—has 
decreased by 30 percent in recent 
years, largely as a result of siltification. 
Connecticut’s 
maritime 
industry 
generates $2.7 billion in economic 
activity every year and supports thirty 
thousand jobs. The decline of these 
harbors hurts the health of the state, not 
just individual cities. 


At the end of September, the state 
of Connecticut began searching for a 
consultant to evaluate its current markets 
and transportation infrastructure and 
to strategize how it can best prepare 
for the expansion. Upon his election, 
Malloy proposed allocating fifty million 
dollars to the revitalization of the ports, 
but for now each port will have to work 
individually to improve its infrastructure. 
Part of the difficulty of re-establishing 
the ports is the absence of a governing 
body in charge of the state’s waterfront. 


The New Haven Port Authority 
shares Morris Cove residents’ worry that 
the Army Corps’s plan puts Bridgeport’s 
interests ahead of New Haven’s. New 
Haven Harbor is due for its own 
decennial maintenance dredging, and 
the borrow pit may be needed for the 
city’s own dirt. Sheiffele says that New 
Haven’s dredge material is much less 
toxic than Bridgeport’s and has been 
deemed suitable for open water disposal. 
In a letter to the Army Corps last April, 
Sheiffele wrote that the current plan 
to use the Morris Cove borrow pit 
for Bridgeport’s waste could increase 
the cost of New Haven’s planned 
maintenance dredge. Rights to use the 
pit are particularly important in light 
of the imminent closing of the Central 
Long Island dump site, the open-water 
disposal location previously used by 
New Haven, scheduled for 2013.


The current Bridgeport plan is 
estimated to cost $42.1 million. The 
alternative, which would require building 
a second CAD cell in Bridgeport harbor, 
would cost $7.6 million more. The
