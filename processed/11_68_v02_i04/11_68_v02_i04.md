**Title: Four stations in his circle**
**Author: Austin C. Clarke**
**Page number(s): 3, 6, 7**

Immigration transformed Jefferson Theophillis Belle, and after five years made him deceitful, selfish and very ambitious. 

It saddened his friend Brewster very much; but he had to confess that Jefferson was the most successful of them all. Still, Brewster pitied him. However, Jefferson had qualities which Brewster tried to emulate, even though JTB was not a likeable man. 

He was too ascetic, and pensive; and his friends hated him for it. But Jefferson had his mind on other things: a house and a piece of land round the house. "I must own a piece o' Canada!" Every morning going to work, as the Sherbourne bus entered Rosedale, he became tense. The houses in Rosedale were large and beautiful; and as far as he could guess, they each had a fireplace . .. because, man, I couldn't purchase a house unless it got a fireplace ... that fire sparkling, and playing games on my face in the winter nights, crick-crack! . .. and sometimes at night, Jefferson would go to Rosedale (once, he went at three in tbe morning) to watch the house he had put his mind on. But this house was not for sale! Gorblummuh! that don't deter me, though! 'cause one o' these mornings it must go up for sale, and I will be standing up right there, with the money in my hand.


Born in the West Indies and residing in Canada, Austin C. Clarke teaches black literature at Yale and is author of anum-ber of novels, the most recent being T he Meeting Point. 


One Friday night in the Paramount Tavern with Brewster, Jefferson had a great urge to see his property. He paid for the drinks, said he had to go to the men's room, slipped out through the back door, and nearly ran into a taxi driver hustling women and passengers. He raised his hand to call the taxi. But he realized that he had already spent a foolish dollar on Brewster; so he changed his mind, and mentally deposited that dollar bill to the $10,000 he had in the bank; and he set out on foot. The wind was chilly. Look, how I nearly throw 'way that dollar 'pon foolishness! I am still a very strong man, at forry. I could walk from Spadina to Rosedale, man; and when he heard his own voice say how wise he was, he walked even faster. Anxiously. he grabbed his left back trousers pocket; "Oh!" he said; and a laugh came out. He didn't trust anybody; certainly not Brewster. He was very glad the money was in his pocket; and yet, for a second, he imagined that the money was actually stolen, and by Brewster. So, he unpinned the two safety pins, undid the button, and took out the money, wrapped in a dirty black handkerchief. His experiences with money made him uneasy. Any day, he might need it for the down-payment (although he could not have known what it would be); and if he wanted a house in Rosedale, he must be prepared. 

He walked slowly now (there was money in his hand); and when he came under a light, he counted it. Nine hundred dollars. 

This money went to work with him; went to church with him ; went into the wash-room at work and at home with him ; and when he went to bed, it was pinned to his pyjamas. "Nine! Right!" He had so much money now, he counted only in hundreds. 

He put the money back into his pocket; pinned it, twice; and buttoned it down. And before he moved on, he made a promise to change the handkerchief. Five years! five years I come to this country, with one pair o' shoes!


Sometimes, in weaker moments, he would argue with himself to get some education, too. Coming through the university grounds, once, by chance, he saw a line of men and women crossing the lawn, with the lawn strewn with roses and flash bulbs and cheers and laughter, and a few tears to give significance to the roses and the bulbs; and he felt then the power of education and the surrounding buildings. 

And he had shaken his head, and run away. The three hours following, he had spent forgetting and getting drunk in the Paramount. That was five years ago. Now, he did not have to run. He walked through the grounds jauntily this time, because he had nine hundred dollars in cash, in his pocket. And as he came out, to enter Queens Park, he saw two shadows; and the two shadows grew into two forms; and one form was raising the skirt above the thighs of the other form; and when they saw him coming, the man covered the girl's reputation with his jacket. They remained still, pretending they were shadows, until a passing car pointed its finger at the girl's back; and Jefferson saw "University of Toronto," written in white letters on the man's jacket. Goddam, he's so broke through education, he can't afford a hotel room!


Far along Bloor Street: the boasting water van is littering Toronto and making some pedestrians wet; and a man holds half of his body through the driver's window, and says, "Night!", and this greeting carries him into Rosedale, quiet as a reservation. Five years of hard work has brought him here, tonight, in front of this huge mansion. I going have to paint them windows, green; and throw a coat o' paint on the doors ... the screens in the windows will be green like in the West Indies ... I going pull up them flowers and put in roses, red ones; and build a paling, and build-up my property value .. . and he goes up on the lawn and tries to count the rooms in the four-storey house. imagine

In Comment: Brewster puts himself on the line for them, Dr. Morris wishes them a good night's sleep, Janis gets hung up on their hang-ups, and the dramat sticks 'em in a brothel. Ah, women. 


With only days to go before the girls arrived, the little office above Dwight Hall Chapel pulsed like a nerve center. Call from Smith. Vassar on the line. Sarah Lawrence wants to know if .... Sifting through the decisions, quickly delegating and accepting responsibilites, Avi Soifer, chairman of the Coeducation-Now Committee, was told that Kingman Brewster was on the line. 

"Oh no, not now. I'm much too busy . . . tell him I'm not in." 

Avi, congratulations and thanks. 


After Dr. John Morris is generally known as the man who invented the "morning-after birth-control pill." A professor of gynecology at the Yale Medical School, Morris is a member of an increasing group of physicians who are practicing the "New Medicine." 

As with the New Politics, there is an intense recognition in medicine of the failure of the old scheme: to deal efficiently with a problem before it becomes a crisis. The population explosion, Morris explained at Silliman College last week, is just such a crisis; for it is our children who will share the world with thirty billion people, ten times the present population, and there are already a billion people living on marginal nutrition. 

This, he claimed, is the doctors' fault, for while they lowered the death rate, they showed no concern for the birth rate. The medical specialty of gynecology remained concerned only with obstetrics. Family planning and abortion are for the rich; we haven't even penetrated the ghettoes yet. 

In a New Haven study of 100 unwed mothers under the age of seventeen, the following was demonstrated for a five-year period: The mothers, only nine of whom were eventually married, gave birth to 340 babies, 238 of which were on the welfare roles. 95 percent of the mothers had more than one pregnancy, 60 percent in the first year, and 89 percent were of the ghetto population. A similar group in another state's study cost the government $20 million by the time they had reached thirty-five. 

Several years ago, birth control was a crime in Connecticut. In a test case sponsored by Yale-New Haven and several planned-parenthood groups, the law was thrown out. At the trial, however, each time a doctor rose to testify, officers of the court rose to save the delicate ears of those present and, in unison, raised and lowered the window shades, creating a clamor which made the testimony inaudible. 

Dr. Morris believes that abortion should be entirely a matter of the woman and her physician. (In communist nations, it is a woman's right to have an abortion if she so desires.) It should be taken off the criminal statutes, as has been done in Maryland, and all of the archaic sex laws, which are embarrassingly unenforceable anyway, should be flushed away. 

In order to deal with poverty, Morris believes, we will have to reduce the birth rate first. India recognized that they could not possibly build schools, create communities and produce food at a rate equaling the expansion of their population. The general revulsion to birth control fell; now there is a national policy for family planning. 

The question of religious ethics may not be as difficult to transcend as is presently believed. In Chile, where the population is predominantly Catholic, the doctors are inserting more intra-uterine devices proportionately than in New Haven; and at the moment, the IUD is the most effective birth control for poorly motivated populations. 

The liberalization of abortion laws remains the tensest debate. In the majority of the states the only legal means of terminating a pregnancy caused by rape is the "morning-after-pill," Dr. Morris's own contribution. It is a large dose of estrogens which causes the lining of the uterus to be unsuitable for implantation of the fertilized ovum. However, very few people are aware of this "pill," and thus we find yet another example of the need for a national standard of sex education. 

Unless the people of the world make a conscious educated effort to curb the population explosion, Morris said, we will see in our time federally policed population control. -----

**Title: Comfort**
**Author: Jim Mann**

Janis Joplin and Big Brother were discussing New Haven after their Saturday-night performance. 

"In some of the towns we play in, all of the girls wear bras, and in other towns, none of them do. In New Haven they all do. 

"I was surrounded by a lot of good-looking chicks tonight," said Janis, "but they all had their tits pointing straight out." 

She was drinking a bottle of Southern Comfort. Between her two performances, she had consumed one pint and had kicked away everyone within fifteen feet of her. During the second show, she openly cursed at the band. 

"Those cold drinks, sometimes you can't hold out on stage for more than thirty minutes a show. 

"Two years ago I used to love this stuff," Janis said, "but now ..." She coughed a little, her eyes watered over, and she sneezed three times. Turning to the guy next to her, she asked, "This doesn't have acid in it, does it? 

"Did you see me spit on stage in the second show? Never thought I'd have to do that. But you've got to if you want to drink and hit some of those notes. 

"I never was known for being too refined, anyway." 

A Yalie was downstairs admiring Janis. He had a little brown derby which Janis rested on her frizzy hair. 

"Can I have it'? Last night in Providence someone gave me a gigantic sculpture, an enormous penis. I'm going to put it in my living room." 

The Yalie asked Janis if he could come see her over Christmas. "I won't remember you then," she replied. "After a couple of hours in a performance, I start to forget, and then I don't remember anything until the next morning." 

Herb Wright, who promoted the performance, says that the performers will get $15,000 for the night, of which Janis personally will get about $8,000. 

"She's a greedy bitch," says Wright. 

Janis is going to leave the Holding Company some time within the next month and pick her own group. She has a few people lined up already, but won't commit herself about it. One of the people she tried to get was Eric Clapton, but that didn't work out. 

"I need real workers," she says. "I'm one of the hardest workers in the business right now."


**Title: Brendan's Be-in**
**Author: [Not specified]**
**Page number(s): 2, 15**

The Yale Dramat's production of The Hostage, being their first production since the departure of Leland Starnes, is a milestone in their recent history. While Mr. Starnes had his strong points, Dramat audiences had been subjected to his consistent weaknesses, for a good many years. 

It is disappointing to see in this new production again a competent performance that in the end lacks the depth and resonance it would need to be a memorable experience. 

Brendan Behan set The Hostage in an Irish brothel populated by a motley assortment of irregular characters who squabble constantly, take their quarrels directly to the audience and always end up by singing someone's favorite song. The Dramat company, under the direction of Charles Maryan, handles the minor characters competently but without great originality. 

Amusing and lively these little people may be, but they are unfortunately familiar; and somewhere between Behan and the Dramat stage, the dynamism of the Irish spirit has leaked out. Instead of a hard-drinking Irish brothel that lets off steam in bawdy jokes and songs to the audience, we are left with something that resembles a small-town music hall on amateur night. 

But Brendan Behan did not write this play as a moment of light satire. He wrote a boisterous and richly textured, biting criticism of Causes. Not all causes, perhaps, but two at least: devout Catholicism and Irish nationalism. Both were tightly woven into his own past. He was educated in Dublin by the French Sisters of Charity, and he joined the Irish Republican Army at the age of fourteen. The good Sisters would not want to claim him, but he spent almost nine years of his life in prison for political crimes connected with the IRA. 

There is some deep feeling behind his mockery of both these causes, a feeling that comes out in the rough boisterousness of his attacks on them. The Dramat seems to have missed this feeling, so the boisterousness they manage comes out tame and one-dimensional. 

The Hostage is a play of tradition trying desperately to ignore the present, of people trying desperately to hold on to traditions in the present by viewing them with heavy irony. But the people of The Hostage, no matter what sarcasm they may be able to lay on their own traditions, are continued on page 15

41 The New Journal I November 17, 1968 
me in this house with four storeys! and not 
one blasted tenant or boarder/ Be be can-
not count nll the rooms from the front, so 
be goes through the alleyway, to look at 
the backyard, -and the rooms in the back, 
and ... (a car passes; and the man driving 
turns his head left, and sees a shadow; and 
he slows down, and the shadow becomes 
a form; he stops, says something on the 
radio in the car; parks the car; walks back, 
and waits) ... Jefferson comes humming 
back to the front lawn and tries again to 
count, and four men pounce upon him and 
drag him along his lawn, with bands on 
his mouth and some in his guts and drop 
him in the hack seat of the car. He can 
bear voices, talking at the same time, com-
ing through the radio speaker. "Good!" 
a living voice says. "Take him to Division 
Two." And they did that. Jefferson Tbe-
ophillis Belle, of no fixed address, un-
known, labourer unskilled, spent a very 
long time before he convinced them that 
he was not a burglourer; and in all that 
time, his head was spinning from the ques-
tions, and from the blows: because you 
were walking round this respectable dis-
trict, this time o' night, with all that money 
on your person, and you're not a burglar? 
to buy a house, eh? that doesn't even have 
a "For Sale" sign up? who are you kidding, 
mack? and they gave him one final kick of 
warning; and with his pride injured ("God 
blind you, cop! so help me God!") he woke 
up Brewster, to see what be thought. 
"They should still be kicking-in your be-
hindi" Brewster said in his heart, as be · 
rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. Without 
compassion, he left Jefferson; and when be 
got back into bed, his blanket was rising 
and falling from the breath of his laughter 
and wishes ... should have kicked-in your 
arse, boy! Brewster couldn't wait for morn-
ing and the Paramount to talk about it. 


After this, Jefferson decided to visit 
Rosedale in the daytime only. When pay 
days came, every cent went into his bank; 
and his balance climbed like a mountain; 
similarly, his hate for black people. A week 
later, he took out a summons against 
Brewster, who owed him twenty dollars 
from three years ago. He tried to get him 
arrested; but his lawyer advised otherwise; 
so Jefferson settled for a collection agency. 
The collection agency got the money back; 
but Jefferson gave it back to Brewster. 
This success convinced him further that 
business was more important than intel-
lect; money more important still. He bad 
seen Jews in the Spadina garment district; 
be bad seen Polish immigrants in the Jew-
ish Market; he had seen their expensive 
automobiles going north after a beautiful 
day of sweating profits; and he said, Me, 
too! soon I going north, tam bien/ 


He stopped drinking at the Paramount. 
He stopped going to the Silver Dollar for 
funk, rhythm, blues and jazz. He didn't 
want to see any more black people. He 
spent more time in his room, alone. On 
weekends, he watched television and drank 
beer; and re-checked his bank book, be-
cause anybody could make a mistake, but 
be-Christ! they ain't making no mistake 
with my money! His actions and his move-
ments became tense, more ordered. His 
disposition became rawer; and once or 
twice, he lost his temper with his super-
visor at the Post Office, and almost lost his 
job; but he lost a slice of pride apologizing. 
The germ implanted upon his sensibili-
ties by the police presuming him a burglar, 
that be was burgling the house of his 
dreams ("God blind you, Mister Police-
man. I am a man, too!") that he, Jefferson 
Theophillis Belle, a' black Barbadian, could 
only through crime possess nine hundred 
dollars in cash ("Double-blind you, Mister 
Ossiferl When I'm working off my arse, 
where are you ... ?") was systematically 
eating away his heart and mind. In isola-
tion, he tried to find some solace. He would 
tell himself jokes, and laugh aloud at his 
own jokes. Still, something was missing. 
The boisterousness of the Paramount was 
gone. He no longer enjoyed Saturday 
mornings in the Negro barber shop on 
Dundas, where he and others, middle-
aged and cronied, would sit, waiting for 
the chair, laughing themselves into hiccups 
with jokes, with the barber, about women 
they knew when they were younger men. 


He went instead north, from Baldwin 
Street to the Italian barber on College. The 
haircuts there were worse, and more ex-
pensive; and time did not improve them. 
He had almost walked away from his 
past, when on that bright Saturday morn-
ing, "Goddamn, "baby!" the Voice picked 
him out, sneaking out of the Italian bar-
ber's, brushing the hair out of his neck. He 
squirmed, because be recognized the 
Voice. It came again, loud and vulgar, "I 
say, goddam, baby!" Jefferson pretended 
he was just one of the European immi-
grants walking the street. And be walked 
on, hiding his head in invisible mounds of 
shame. The Voice disappeared. He relaxed 
and breathed more easily. And suddenly, 
he felt the hand on his neck, and "God-
dammitl baby, ain't you speaking to no 
niggers this morning, you sweet black 
motherfuckerl" All the eyes in the foreign-
language heads turned to listen. Then in 
a voice the eyes couldn't hear, "Lend me a 
couple bucks, baby. Races." 
Jefferson Theophillis Belle made a men-
tal note right then, never again to speak 
to black people. 


He found himself walking through the 
campus grounds again; spending long 
hours pondering the stem buildings; the 
library crammed with knowledge in print, 
and the building where he had seen the 
lines of penguins dressed ·in black and 
white, like graduate scholars. Education is 
a funny thing, heh-heh-heh! and I had 
better get a piece o' that, too. He argued 
himself into a piece of education; but he 
held fast to the piece of property, too. He 
visited some institutions, and took away 
their prospectuses, to study ... these things 
make me out as if I don't know that two 
and two is four, that the world round, that 
Columbus discover it in 1492, that that 
bastard sailed down in my islands and 
come back and called them Indian, hah-
hah! . .. if it was me make that mistake,

"How can a pragmatic people like the 
Chinese have gone off the deep end this 
way?" asks a Yale undergraduate, reflect-
ing in his question a stereotype of Chinese 
"character" that is widespread among in-
telligent and generally well-informed 
Americans. "I am beginning to think that 
there was something after all to the old 
idea of the Yellow Peril," writes an alum-
nus of ten years ago who had thought, 
until the Great Proletarian Cultural Revo-
lution, that the Chinese were working 
things out in their own incomprehensible 
ways but that the rest of the world could 
probably live with the result.


For many of the middle-aged and 
older who felt personally involved in the 
Chinese civil war, old wounds have been 
reopened and debates of forty years' stand-
ing revived.


For one group, the events of the past 
three years have been the final working-
out of a tragedy with themes that were 
clear from the beginning. For another, 
these same events have undercut the fight 
of a lifetime to bring the Chinese commun-
ist movement under a rational light, in the 
expectation that tensions could be eased 
if Americans could only understand.


To the new radical youth of the West, 
the Chinese Cultural Revolution has posed 
different but no less divisive problems. 
Glancing fragments of Maoism are picked 
up out of context wherever a group senses 
an empathy with what it finds: the open 
horizons of romantic anarchism, intense 
discipline and struggle in the name of vary-
ing ends, young "wanderers" playing 
chess in the sunshine as others argue the 
issues of life and death. There is no more 
effort to put Maoism in its own setting 
than there is to reconcile these rationally . 
opposed goals. Neither history nor linear 
logic is considered relevant.


These varying reactions to the Cultural 
Revolution have one thing in common: 
they stem from a continuing Western self-
preoccupation-individual or collective 
-with our problems. We condemn the ad-
ministration, both major parties, or-
ganized business and organized labor for 
refusing to attempt to get beneath the 
surface of what is happening in China, for 
projecting their hopes and fears onto a 
screen and calling it China. Yet much of 
the academic and serious journalistic 
writing on China today suffers from pre-
cisely this flaw, Jess crudely expos~. In a 
shrinking world more than one-quarter of 
which is Chinese, this dominance of old 
assumptions reflects a failure of the im-
agination, a rigidity and inadaptability to 
altered circumstances that portends catas-
trophe.


Dr. Lifton's superb essay points the way 
to a fresh examination that makes these 
sterile preoccupations irrelevant. It is not 
the first study of the Cultural Revolution; 
easily a hundred serious and substantial 
articles on the subject have been pub-
lished. The author has taken account of 
these without attempting to summarize 
them. The seminal importance of this 
book lies in the way questions are formu-
lated and possible answers suggested.


Probing into fundamentals, it is an essay 
which no specialist can ignore and which 
at the same time offers an excellent spring-
board into the study of contemporary 
China for thoughtful adults with little 
background on the subject.


The central question is this: The Chinese 
have a millennia! record of the highest 
accomplishment in every field of human 
endeavor, a record of an ability to disci-
pline their vast energies toward millenary 
goals. The Chinese tradition of dealing 
with crises of politics, technology and 
nature through psychic cultivation, based 
on a belief in the malleability and teach-
ability of man is today reinforced by 
China's need for the highest morale and 
discipline. Yet paradoxically, Mao's su-
preme effort to this end, the Cultural 
Revolution, has ended in a paralyzing loss 
of discipline and morale. Why did Mao 
try anything so fantastic and what effects 
may we anticipate?


Dr. Lifton scarcely mentions problems 
of politics (in the usual sense), economics 
or social structure. He recognizes their 
importance but argues convincingly that 
we have been bewildered by a welter of 
specific but disjointed data on these sub-
jects because we have not looked at the 
problems of psychohistory, which in his 
view underlie the present Chinese social 
structure or any other. He attaches no real 
importance to the rumors of personal 
cliques and their favoritisms and quarrels 
-rumors that pre-empt most of the little 
space the American press can spare for 
news of China. He is basically concerned 
with two main questions: the contours of 
Mao's personality as a revolutionary lead-
er and the psychohistorical dynamics of 
the Cultural Revolution. He treats these 
not only as problems of a specific time and 
place but also as illustrations of pheno-
mena that may shed light on individual 
and group behavior in all times and places.


The central theme of the treatment both 
of Mao and of the Cultural Revolution 
is revolutionary immortality: the passion-
ate conviction that the lives and deaths 
of the pioneer generation of guerrilla 
revolutionary leaders will be meaning-
less unless they live on in a continuing 
uninterrupted revolution that returns per-
ennially to its sources in the Chinese 
countryside. Dr. Lifton does not argue that 
this is the only theme one could choose. 
"Large historical events cannot be attrib-
uted to a single c<tuse, nor grapsed by a 
single explanation." I am persuaded by 
this book, however, that the compulsion to 
find revolutionary immortality is prob-
ably the most significant element in the 
Cultural Revolution. It is certainly the 
freshest and one which no scholar other 
than Dr. Lifton could have formulated.


Who else can use psychological and psy-
choanalytic concepts without being con-
stricted by them, finding his science no 
more infallible than others, and is at the 
same time versed in history and intimately 
familiar with Chinese (and Japanese) re-
actions to the problems they and their cul-
tures face?


Dr. Lifton deliberately avoids discus-
sion of Mao's sharp conflict with his father, 
for that would lead to a full psycho-
biography of Mao. He finds the theme of 
conquering death more central than the 
Oedipus complex to the development of 
the heroic personality. The reader will find 
here staggering evidence, in brief com-
pass, on Mao's repeated escapes as his 
wife, son and old comrades were killed in 
action. Mao's reactions to this cumula-
tive experience became comprehensible 
when viewed as illustrations of survivor-
guilt. To overcome this guilt, and in-
creasingly with age to find the end of all 
men's rainbows, Mao has sought revolu-
tionary immortality not merely as a legend 
-although he has long since been one-
but as part of a revolutionary process that 
can be immortal only if it continues and 
accelerates.


Hence the re-emergence as early as 1957 
of the idea of permanent or uninterrupted 
revolution and the inauguration at that 
time of the Great Leap Forward-an effort 
to vault over the stages of development 
in the history of other countries and to 
achieve overnight by sheer will-power not 
just what it has taken other countries gen-
erations to accomplish, but far more, and 
to use each new peak of triumph as a 
base for the assault on a higher peak, on 
into the infinite future.


After the Great Leap Forward in the 
late 1950s failed, why then, after a brief 
period of relaxation, did Mao and his in-
ner circle feel impelled to order a far more 
daring leap, the Cultural Revolution? To 
Dr. Lifton, this decision was not a symp-
tom of madness in any clinical sense nor of 
senility, and certainly not the product of 
the intrigues of wives. He suggests that 
Mao, facing certain and possibly imminent 
biological death, despite his show of swim-
ming the Yangtze at age 72, became ob-
sessed with symbolic immortality. The rev-
olution must go on, yet the younger gen-
eration knew guerilla warfare only as 
history, tens of thousands of technocrats 
struggled with problems that did not lend 
themselves to solution by struggle and self-
criticism, and even Party cadres were 
settling into established routines.


It should be :remembered that the gov-
ernment apparatus, dominated by Liu 
Shao-ch'i's "right-wingers," had been re-
sponsible for the first Five Year Plan and 
for tremendous gains in most spheres of 
public and private life. But the free criti-
cism invited during the Hundred Flowers 
Period resulted .in open expressed demands 
for uninhibited, self-propelled develop-
ment in all the arts; systematic, "bour-
geois" scientific procedures in scholarship; 
more consumer goods and some little 
pleasures and comforts in life. As one 
worker put it, a hard day's work, a good 
dinner with wine and to bed with my wife. 
This was the end of the Maoist dream: 
embourgeoisement.


To keep the whole picture in proportion, 
Dr. Lifton might also have noted that fur-
ther forced-draft development was prob-
ably necessary before most Chinese could 
reap any such rewards and that the foreign 
policies of both the Soviet Union and the 
United States gave credible grounds for 
what many outsiders have interpreted as 
paranoid fears of foreign attack.


The party apparatus had been in charge 
of the Great Leap that failed. With State 
and Party machinery both compromised, 
Mao turned to the People's Liberation 
Army, a living reminder of the glorious 
tradition of the revolution. He also ap-
pealed directly to the very young, not only 
youths but children, to form themselves 
into Red Guards and to smash the "re-
visionists," "capitalists" and other enemies 
of the immortal revolution. With schools 
closed, the young roamed the country, 
finding enemies everywhere-in state, 
Party and army.


Mao's solution was to open all the flood-
gates and loose the revolutionary fervor of 
the very young, whipped to a fever, against 
what had become a revolutionary estab-
lishment: 
"In place of his formerly sensitive applica-
tions of personal passions to China's des-
perate historical experience, we encounter a 
misplaced faith in his own psychic state, a 
substitution of his own psychic history for his-
tory at large. Because he and a few around 
him fear the death of the revolution, China 
must be made to convulse."


Dr. Lifton does not argue that Mao's in-
trapsychic struggles fully explain the 
course of the Chinese revolution since 
Mao's ascendancy in 1935 or its latest 
phase, the Cultural Revolution. What he 
does argue is that "they now spread con-
fusion and antagonism rather than the 
illumination they had in the past." It is im-
portant to remember that this very drive 
toward the unattainable, this "psych ism" 
in Maoist thought-the belief that the sub-
jective can overcome the objective-has 
always been an essential factor in what is, 
aJI in all, the spectacular success story of 
the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Com-
munist Party has used every resource at its 
command, but it early discovered that lack-
ing economic incentives, psychological 
incentives could literally work wonders.


Claims that the "thought of Mao Tse-
tung" has been responsible for everything 
from the victory of the Chinese team in 
an international table tennis tournament to 
the development of thermonuclear wea-
pons have been greeted with derision 
abroad. Yet Dr. Lifton quotes the presi-
dent of the United States Table Tennis As-
sociation: 
"The writings and spirit of Mao invade every 
match the Chinese play. The national team, 
before beginning play, recite Mao quotations 
to give them courage, and in the middle of a 
tense game a Chinese crowd will often chant 
Mao's sayings to spur their heroes on. It has 
a terrific psychological effect, seeming to 
drive them to feats of endurance and other 
exceptional efforts."


Table tennis is a vivid but trivial example. 
The record of the Chinese revolution is 
full of well attested instances where the 
words of Mao have literally inspired men 
to achieve what observers declared impos-
sible. The point these observers missed is 
the "psychism" (something considerably 
more potent than the extreme voluntarist 
strain in European Marxist thought) that 
Dr. Lifton finds central to Maoism and the 
Cultural Revolution. The achievements, 
in his view, are almost enough to "take the 
fallacy out of the psychistic fallacy."


Almost, but not quite. This extraordi-
nary leader, building on an age-old heri-
tage of belief in the central importance of 
the indoctrinated mind in governing man 
and nature, can evoke responses that lead 
to quadrupled effort; but he faces modern 
technology. He may-perhaps must-be-
lieve that through his ideology his "pure" 
young followers can become "absolute 
conquerers of men, technology and death."


For Mao is both attracted to technology 
and repelled by its social consequences. 
An outmoded factory may multiply its out-
put if devoted men not only give all their 
strength but all their minds to doing the 
best possible job with the means available. 
Manpower may be harnessed to build 
dams in record time. But although high 
morale never hurt a physicist or an econ-
omist, Dr. Lifton regards it as patently 
absurd to regard China's achievement in 
nuclear physics as a result of political in-
doctrination or "to treat capital formation 
as a type of guerilla warfare."


These are the factors behind the recur-
rent "Red and Expert" controversy. Is it 
more important to be a zealous believer 
("red") or to develop professional compe-
tence? A country of "red experts" is the 
ultimate but unattainable goal, and so the 
official line has swung at intervals from one 
extreme of encouraging expertise and 
telling the cadres to leave the professionals 
in peace to work, to the other of proudly 
declaring that redness is expertise: "The 
redder the more expert."


Dr. Lifton relates this tension to the ten-
sion in Chinese history between "essence" 
and "function" (t'i-yung). He does not be-
lieve that "redness and expertise" can be 
combined without mutual transformation, 
any more than the reformers of the cen-
tury preceeding Mao succeeded in using 
the t'i-yung formulation as a way of rising 
to the Western challenge without accept-
ing the implications behind that challenge. 
The idea of "Chinese values as the founda-
tion or essence, Western skills for prac-
tical or functional use" (Chung-hsiieh wei 
t'i, hsi-hsiieh-wei yung) led to a long and 
tortuous tragedy that achieved neither of 
its goals.


Dr. Lifton seems to me to be saying that 
although the Cultural Revolution was 
bound to fail, it was not an anomaly and it 
should not have come as a surprise. Nor 
are Mao's pronouncements the ravings of 
an aged madman. both represent the new-
est and most extreme of a series of efforts 
of the true believers to couple the pure 
hearts and bare hands of the Chinese peas-
antry with twenty-first century technology. 
This particular effort has failed, but we 
do not yet see the technocrats back in con-
trol, in spite of the efforts t9 pacify and 
discipline aroused youth and to restore the 
authority of the Party. I suspect that what 
Dr. Lifton repeatedly refers to as "im-
mortalizing visions" are likely to recur. 
Their roots lie deep in several strata of 
Chinese tradition. Further, and here I dis-
agree with Dr. Lifton, China's present

Fragments of a Saturday afternoon 
by Jonathan Coppelman and Kenneth Cavander 
The bands of alumni in station wagons roll 
down Route 34, bowing to the altar-like 
facade of the Walter Camp Archway and 
moving across the road onto the grass. 
They eat their lunch beside parked auto-
mobiles as portable bars and picnic baskets 
magically produce sustenance for the 
game to come. The widespread use of 
liquor helps to break down the mind's 
resistance as these initiates try to get them-
selves totally smashed, that is totally in-
volved. There is a desire to recall the myths 
of an earlier time of racoon coats, hip 
flasks- "total belief." 

As they eat, in this prelude to the Ritual, 
the Bowl looms through the pillars like an 
enormous receptacle, its contents a mys-
tery. The many entrances to the bowl are 
like long dark tunnels-transitional pas-
sageways which clearly divide the game 
world from their daily lives-rites de pas-
sage moving these initiates from the real 
into the surreal. A burst of color at the end 
and they are born again. 

When these followers of the game finally 
manage to tear themselves away from their 
banquet, they move in a long procession 
into the stadium. The seats are assigned; 
even in this mass event there is careful 
control and situation of participants. There 
is an unusual amount of contact among 
people, who sit on long, wooden planks. 
The contact of the bodies creates a circuit 
that seems to run around the stadium. 
/otUJthan Coppelman, a second-year critic 
at the Drama School, is a candidate for a 
Doctor of Fine Arts degree. 
Kenneth Cavander has reported for the 
London Times, has written television 
screenplays for the BBC and has been as-
sociated with both the Royal Shakespeare 
Company and the Royal Court Theatre. 
He presently teaches in the classics depart-
ment as well as the Drama School. His 
adaptation of The Bacchae will be pro-
duced by the Yale Re~rtory Theatre in 
March. 

The Stadium. The task is to create a uni-
fied, self-contained, completely autono-
mous setting for violence, in which the 
spectators face the opponent's followers 
across the field. In between the two 
groups is the zone (the killing zone) where 
the game takes place. The design both 
separates the two groups and unites them 
in a common interest. The symmetry of 
the field with its clear, even demarcations, 
marks the exclusive area where the vio-
lence will occur. 

Through different sight lines and a dif-
ferent relationship of spectator to event, 
the focus of energies could be dispersed 
throughout the crowd, creating an enor-
mously explosive situation. In this less in-
sulated structure the opposing factions 
might tear each other apart. Thus the de-
sign of the present Bowl manifests an 
ancient understanding. 

Football is a completely autonomous 
world, totally self-contained. It has its own 
limits of space and corresponding bound-
aries of time. The game is played in four 
15-minute quarters-an arbitrary but 
rigidly enforced span; the space is one 
hundred yards of grass, marked off in five-
yard intervals. 

In this autonomous world, the players 
are identified through certain conventional 
characteristics. By the nature of the Ritual, 
these characteristics help the spectators 
bridge the gulf between the idealized 
world of their heroes and their own un-
glamorous existence. Through identifica-
tion they can share in the exploits of the 
players. 

First the players are given a number, 
for immediate identification in the course 
of the afternoon's events: success, mis-
take, injury. Second, place of birth and 
education: the origin and roots of Sat-
urday's heroes, with a slight suggestion of 
the sources of development which led the 
heroes to move beyond the limitations of 
ordinary men. The players from far away, 
vague territories (Wyoming, Ohio) are the 
most interesting. 


--- Page 11 ---

The final and most-observed character-
istic is size: Bigness is a central mystique 
in football; the players for the most part 
must be bigger than life, for the experience 
they engage in is extraordinary, clearly of 
a different magnitude than daily life on 
campus. Aside from their practical use, 
shoulder pads and helmets enhance the size 
of the players and create an impersonal, 
ritualized appearance-the equipment in 
football is more imposing and impersonal 
than that of any other competitive sport. 
The pattern of action is as follows: one 
party tries to open holes into which a mem-
ber projects himself; the opposing role 
players respond by attempting to close any 
such holes and knock down the intruder, 
who tries to remain erect as long as pos-
sible. The conventions of blocking and 
tackling, the methodology of advancing 
the ball, involve an aggressive relation to 
an opposite member-a basic pattern of 
penetration-response rooted in the sexual 
act itself. 

With all their size and strength we have 
only a very slight sense of the heroes' 
vulnerability. Clearly, these men are mor-
tal. Achilles had his heel, the halfback his 
ankle, the quarterback his knee--everyone 
is susceptible to injury, and it seems the 
best players are in the most precarious po-
sition: as the toeam's fortunes rest largely 
on their well-being, they are singled out 
for attack by the opposing forces. 

"KILL 81 !" they chant as an overzeal-
ous defender crunches the home hero five 
yards out of bounds. There are severe 
limits to the application of force, and the 
opposing player has violated them. But 
the coach simply whisks the player out of 
of the game; once out of play, he is out 
of reach, untouchable, and in some sense 
no longer real. The crowd remembers him 
and invokes vengeance for a short while. 
But concentration always returns to the 
given moment, and memory is short-lived. 

The half-time is a completely failed ex-
perience. It is an attempt at comic relief, 
somewhat like the satyr play used in 
Greek tragedy. The contrived, sophomoric 
quality of the humor is simply contrasted . 
to the heroic magnitude of the event that 
surrounds it. The marching formations 
and the irony are simply inadequate to the 
energies focused upon them-energies de-
rived from the game that surrounds the 
half-time show. In attempting to fill a void 
(the time-space continuum of the game 
itself is suspended), the bands simply call 
attention to the void and make it obvious 
that the low-comic organization of numer-
ous people in formation is non-heroic. 

Late in the game a malaise permeates 
the supporters, though their team leads 
by many points. There is a feeling of some 
vague, immense failure. Winning was not 
the fruition, the culmination it is supposed 
to be. Conversation turns from the game 
to the parties and dancing to follow. The 
game itself is only part of a series of ex-
periences designed to regenerate the body. 

The football weekend is rooted in the 
week that precedes it. It comes out of the 
monastic structure of the life with its tight-
ly organized time, its ascetic demands and 
continual self-denials. All week the in-
dividual must repress an entire aspect of 
his existence in order to survive and excel. 
The football week-end is a direct response 
to the week-an opposite generated by five 
days of insanely regimented existence. The 
weekend must be everything that the 
week is not: free, sensual, erotic. A time 
for the body. 

We know that Greek theater, perhaps all 
theater, began as a fertility rite, to make 
the grapes grow. What happened-people 
went out into the fields and had an orgy, 
and then they said to the grapes, "Go on, 
now you do it!" and that way they hoped 
the crops would keep coming up year after 
year and not die every fall. And out of 
this came theater. It's a ritual, basically, 
theater-a ritual in which we all go out 
into the field and get smashed. tolE

international position makes these visions 
and the consequent "irrationality" almost a 
necessity. The "pragmatists"-embodied 
in the pilloried Chief of State Liu Shao-ch'i 
--cannot win over the ideologues as long 
as China's margin of survival seems pre-
carious to Chinese. The belligerent posture 
of the United States and the Soviet have in 
my opinion been a prime factor in tipping 
the balance in favor of redness and non-
rational psychism over calm, evolutionary 
pragmatic professionalism. It is worth re-
membering that the first great burst of 
Chinese "irrationality" coincided with the 
advance of troops under the command of 
General Douglas MacArthur to the Yalu 
River reservoirs and the Manchurian 
frontier. 

Thus far, the outside world has been for-
tunate. The threats and pressures of out-
side powers have led to internal convulsion 
only. Chinese foreign policy has been 
marked by extreme caution. But if our 
present attitudes continue, we may face 
psychism in Chinese foreign policy, with 
the consequent death not only of the Chi-
nese revolution but of the human race.

trapped by them. And a person who is 
trapped is never simple, never without a 
certain inner tension. 

In making for The Hostage the series of 
choices that constitute a director's inter-
pretation of a play, Charles Maryan has 
consistently chosen the tamer and simpler 
way. Bunny Cohn's quiet ferocity and 
Drew Denbaum's placidy Irish observance 
of the passing world are competent per-
formances taken for themselves. The hos-
tage himself (Perry King) and the IRA offi-
cer (Jeff Pressman) play only slightly be-
low the level of intensity that seems called 
for by the situation and the script. No one 
of these interpretations would make a tame 
play, but together they systematically pull 
the play's teeth. 

Behan is more careless of the sharp 
side of the play than any production can 
afford to be. He lets the seriousness of the 
situation go unmentioned for such long 
stretches of playing around that when the 
claws do come out, they have to be felt. 

A friend of Behan's once commented, 
"Brendan would drop his trousers in 
church for a laugh." Little that is sacred 
to the Irish is sacred in the same way to an 
· American audience, and the Dramat has 
not managed to overcome the culture gap. 

Their production is more like someone 
opening his fly in a railroad station. Amus-
ing if you're in on it, but not shocking, 
not a real gas.
