me in this house with four storeys! and not 
one blasted tenant or boarder/ Be be can-
not count nll the rooms from the front, so 
be goes through the alleyway, to look at 
the backyard, -and the rooms in the back, 
and ... (a car passes; and the man driving 
turns his head left, and sees a shadow; and 
he slows down, and the shadow becomes 
a form; he stops, says something on the 
radio in the car; parks the car; walks back, 
and waits) ... Jefferson comes humming 
back to the front lawn and tries again to 
count, and four men pounce upon him and 
drag him along his lawn, with bands on 
his mouth and some in his guts and drop 
him in the hack seat of the car. He can 
bear voices, talking at the same time, com-
ing through the radio speaker. "Good!" 
a living voice says. "Take him to Division 
Two." And they did that. Jefferson Tbe-
ophillis Belle, of no fixed address, un-
known, labourer unskilled, spent a very 
long time before he convinced them that 
he was not a burglourer; and in all that 
time, his head was spinning from the ques-
tions, and from the blows: because you 
were walking round this respectable dis-
trict, this time o' night, with all that money 
on your person, and you're not a burglar? 
to buy a house, eh? that doesn't even have 
a "For Sale" sign up? who are you kidding, 
mack? and they gave him one final kick of 
warning; and with his pride injured ("God 
blind you, cop! so help me God!") he woke 
up Brewster, to see what be thought. 
"They should still be kicking-in your be-
hindi" Brewster said in his heart, as be · 
rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. Without 
compassion, he left Jefferson; and when be 
got back into bed, his blanket was rising 
and falling from the breath of his laughter 
and wishes ... should have kicked-in your 
arse, boy! Brewster couldn't wait for morn-
ing and the Paramount to talk about it. 


After this, Jefferson decided to visit 
Rosedale in the daytime only. When pay 
days came, every cent went into his bank; 
and his balance climbed like a mountain; 
similarly, his hate for black people. A week 
later, he took out a summons against 
Brewster, who owed him twenty dollars 
from three years ago. He tried to get him 
arrested; but his lawyer advised otherwise; 
so Jefferson settled for a collection agency. 
The collection agency got the money back; 
but Jefferson gave it back to Brewster. 
This success convinced him further that 
business was more important than intel-
lect; money more important still. He bad 
seen Jews in the Spadina garment district; 
be bad seen Polish immigrants in the Jew-
ish Market; he had seen their expensive 
automobiles going north after a beautiful 
day of sweating profits; and he said, Me, 
too! soon I going north, tam bien/ 


He stopped drinking at the Paramount. 
He stopped going to the Silver Dollar for 
funk, rhythm, blues and jazz. He didn't 
want to see any more black people. He 
spent more time in his room, alone. On 
weekends, he watched television and drank 
beer; and re-checked his bank book, be-
cause anybody could make a mistake, but 
be-Christ! they ain't making no mistake 
with my money! His actions and his move-
ments became tense, more ordered. His 
disposition became rawer; and once or 
twice, he lost his temper with his super-
visor at the Post Office, and almost lost his 
job; but he lost a slice of pride apologizing. 
The germ implanted upon his sensibili-
ties by the police presuming him a burglar, 
that be was burgling the house of his 
dreams ("God blind you, Mister Police-
man. I am a man, too!") that he, Jefferson 
Theophillis Belle, a' black Barbadian, could 
only through crime possess nine hundred 
dollars in cash ("Double-blind you, Mister 
Ossiferl When I'm working off my arse, 
where are you ... ?") was systematically 
eating away his heart and mind. In isola-
tion, he tried to find some solace. He would 
tell himself jokes, and laugh aloud at his 
own jokes. Still, something was missing. 
The boisterousness of the Paramount was 
gone. He no longer enjoyed Saturday 
mornings in the Negro barber shop on 
Dundas, where he and others, middle-
aged and cronied, would sit, waiting for 
the chair, laughing themselves into hiccups 
with jokes, with the barber, about women 
they knew when they were younger men. 


He went instead north, from Baldwin 
Street to the Italian barber on College. The 
haircuts there were worse, and more ex-
pensive; and time did not improve them. 
He had almost walked away from his 
past, when on that bright Saturday morn-
ing, "Goddamn, "baby!" the Voice picked 
him out, sneaking out of the Italian bar-
ber's, brushing the hair out of his neck. He 
squirmed, because be recognized the 
Voice. It came again, loud and vulgar, "I 
say, goddam, baby!" Jefferson pretended 
he was just one of the European immi-
grants walking the street. And be walked 
on, hiding his head in invisible mounds of 
shame. The Voice disappeared. He relaxed 
and breathed more easily. And suddenly, 
he felt the hand on his neck, and "God-
dammitl baby, ain't you speaking to no 
niggers this morning, you sweet black 
motherfuckerl" All the eyes in the foreign-
language heads turned to listen. Then in 
a voice the eyes couldn't hear, "Lend me a 
couple bucks, baby. Races." 
Jefferson Theophillis Belle made a men-
tal note right then, never again to speak 
to black people. 


He found himself walking through the 
campus grounds again; spending long 
hours pondering the stem buildings; the 
library crammed with knowledge in print, 
and the building where he had seen the 
lines of penguins dressed ·in black and 
white, like graduate scholars. Education is 
a funny thing, heh-heh-heh! and I had 
better get a piece o' that, too. He argued 
himself into a piece of education; but he 
held fast to the piece of property, too. He 
visited some institutions, and took away 
their prospectuses, to study ... these things 
make me out as if I don't know that two 
and two is four, that the world round, that 
Columbus discover it in 1492, that that 
bastard sailed down in my islands and 
come back and called them Indian, hah-
hah! . .. if it was me make that mistake,
