Immigration transformed Jefferson Theophillis Belle, and after five years made him deceitful, selfish and very ambitious. 

It saddened his friend Brewster very much; but he had to confess that Jefferson was the most successful of them all. Still, Brewster pitied him. However, Jefferson had qualities which Brewster tried to emulate, even though JTB was not a likeable man. 

He was too ascetic, and pensive; and his friends hated him for it. But Jefferson had his mind on other things: a house and a piece of land round the house. "I must own a piece o' Canada!" Every morning going to work, as the Sherbourne bus entered Rosedale, he became tense. The houses in Rosedale were large and beautiful; and as far as he could guess, they each had a fireplace . .. because, man, I couldn't purchase a house unless it got a fireplace ... that fire sparkling, and playing games on my face in the winter nights, crick-crack! . .. and sometimes at night, Jefferson would go to Rosedale (once, he went at three in tbe morning) to watch the house he had put his mind on. But this house was not for sale! Gorblummuh! that don't deter me, though! 'cause one o' these mornings it must go up for sale, and I will be standing up right there, with the money in my hand.


Born in the West Indies and residing in Canada, Austin C. Clarke teaches black literature at Yale and is author of anum-ber of novels, the most recent being T he Meeting Point. 


One Friday night in the Paramount Tavern with Brewster, Jefferson had a great urge to see his property. He paid for the drinks, said he had to go to the men's room, slipped out through the back door, and nearly ran into a taxi driver hustling women and passengers. He raised his hand to call the taxi. But he realized that he had already spent a foolish dollar on Brewster; so he changed his mind, and mentally deposited that dollar bill to the $10,000 he had in the bank; and he set out on foot. The wind was chilly. Look, how I nearly throw 'way that dollar 'pon foolishness! I am still a very strong man, at forry. I could walk from Spadina to Rosedale, man; and when he heard his own voice say how wise he was, he walked even faster. Anxiously. he grabbed his left back trousers pocket; "Oh!" he said; and a laugh came out. He didn't trust anybody; certainly not Brewster. He was very glad the money was in his pocket; and yet, for a second, he imagined that the money was actually stolen, and by Brewster. So, he unpinned the two safety pins, undid the button, and took out the money, wrapped in a dirty black handkerchief. His experiences with money made him uneasy. Any day, he might need it for the down-payment (although he could not have known what it would be); and if he wanted a house in Rosedale, he must be prepared. 

He walked slowly now (there was money in his hand); and when he came under a light, he counted it. Nine hundred dollars. 

This money went to work with him; went to church with him ; went into the wash-room at work and at home with him ; and when he went to bed, it was pinned to his pyjamas. "Nine! Right!" He had so much money now, he counted only in hundreds. 

He put the money back into his pocket; pinned it, twice; and buttoned it down. And before he moved on, he made a promise to change the handkerchief. Five years! five years I come to this country, with one pair o' shoes!


Sometimes, in weaker moments, he would argue with himself to get some education, too. Coming through the university grounds, once, by chance, he saw a line of men and women crossing the lawn, with the lawn strewn with roses and flash bulbs and cheers and laughter, and a few tears to give significance to the roses and the bulbs; and he felt then the power of education and the surrounding buildings. 

And he had shaken his head, and run away. The three hours following, he had spent forgetting and getting drunk in the Paramount. That was five years ago. Now, he did not have to run. He walked through the grounds jauntily this time, because he had nine hundred dollars in cash, in his pocket. And as he came out, to enter Queens Park, he saw two shadows; and the two shadows grew into two forms; and one form was raising the skirt above the thighs of the other form; and when they saw him coming, the man covered the girl's reputation with his jacket. They remained still, pretending they were shadows, until a passing car pointed its finger at the girl's back; and Jefferson saw "University of Toronto," written in white letters on the man's jacket. Goddam, he's so broke through education, he can't afford a hotel room!


Far along Bloor Street: the boasting water van is littering Toronto and making some pedestrians wet; and a man holds half of his body through the driver's window, and says, "Night!", and this greeting carries him into Rosedale, quiet as a reservation. Five years of hard work has brought him here, tonight, in front of this huge mansion. I going have to paint them windows, green; and throw a coat o' paint on the doors ... the screens in the windows will be green like in the West Indies ... I going pull up them flowers and put in roses, red ones; and build a paling, and build-up my property value .. . and he goes up on the lawn and tries to count the rooms in the four-storey house. imagine
