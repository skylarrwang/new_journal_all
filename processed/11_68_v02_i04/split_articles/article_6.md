The Yale Dramat's production of The Hostage, being their first production since the departure of Leland Starnes, is a milestone in their recent history. While Mr. Starnes had his strong points, Dramat audiences had been subjected to his consistent weaknesses, for a good many years. 

It is disappointing to see in this new production again a competent performance that in the end lacks the depth and resonance it would need to be a memorable experience. 

Brendan Behan set The Hostage in an Irish brothel populated by a motley assortment of irregular characters who squabble constantly, take their quarrels directly to the audience and always end up by singing someone's favorite song. The Dramat company, under the direction of Charles Maryan, handles the minor characters competently but without great originality. 

Amusing and lively these little people may be, but they are unfortunately familiar; and somewhere between Behan and the Dramat stage, the dynamism of the Irish spirit has leaked out. Instead of a hard-drinking Irish brothel that lets off steam in bawdy jokes and songs to the audience, we are left with something that resembles a small-town music hall on amateur night. 

But Brendan Behan did not write this play as a moment of light satire. He wrote a boisterous and richly textured, biting criticism of Causes. Not all causes, perhaps, but two at least: devout Catholicism and Irish nationalism. Both were tightly woven into his own past. He was educated in Dublin by the French Sisters of Charity, and he joined the Irish Republican Army at the age of fourteen. The good Sisters would not want to claim him, but he spent almost nine years of his life in prison for political crimes connected with the IRA. 

There is some deep feeling behind his mockery of both these causes, a feeling that comes out in the rough boisterousness of his attacks on them. The Dramat seems to have missed this feeling, so the boisterousness they manage comes out tame and one-dimensional. 

The Hostage is a play of tradition trying desperately to ignore the present, of people trying desperately to hold on to traditions in the present by viewing them with heavy irony. But the people of The Hostage, no matter what sarcasm they may be able to lay on their own traditions, are continued on page 15
