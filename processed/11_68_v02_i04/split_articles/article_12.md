Dear A. ' 
Th1s ls a hard letter to wrtte. 
I •on•t atnoe words. 
When you 
got talllng-down drunk tn the restaurant and had your publlo out-
burst as a celebrity, I gaYe up on you. 
A aoralistlo selt-
rtghteousneas surged up ~ throat llke unexpected •oatt. Thla 
haa lett ae tarr1t1ed or unlo.tng daaena wh1oh, I failed to reallza, 
aa'- thelr not unooarortable hoae tnstde ~ otherwise (of course) 
lo.lq traae. 

It didn' t ooour to me, as I looked 1n pur1tan1cal dlsgust at you, 
to aak ~ 
you were lousy drunk 1n that publlo place. 
Yet , I said 
to arse~ln a gll ... r of reoogn1t1on , 1t wasn' t tun and saaea tor 
you. 
Bully tor ae. 
Chalk up a userul nuaber or ae;rus to help ae 
out or goddaa burnlng hell. 

All right . 
The potnt ta I haYen't thought or .uoh alae slnoe the 
Inotdent when you alaply blew up and went to plaoee wtth a lot or 
people looking on. 
Aaong other thlnga, I realtse I had ataply not 
mown you betore and aa n- queat1on1ng to what cle.,._ I'•• known
