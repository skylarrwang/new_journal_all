In Comment: Brewster puts himself on the line for them, Dr. Morris wishes them a good night's sleep, Janis gets hung up on their hang-ups, and the dramat sticks 'em in a brothel. Ah, women. 


With only days to go before the girls arrived, the little office above Dwight Hall Chapel pulsed like a nerve center. Call from Smith. Vassar on the line. Sarah Lawrence wants to know if .... Sifting through the decisions, quickly delegating and accepting responsibilites, Avi Soifer, chairman of the Coeducation-Now Committee, was told that Kingman Brewster was on the line. 

"Oh no, not now. I'm much too busy . . . tell him I'm not in." 

Avi, congratulations and thanks. 


After Dr. John Morris is generally known as the man who invented the "morning-after birth-control pill." A professor of gynecology at the Yale Medical School, Morris is a member of an increasing group of physicians who are practicing the "New Medicine." 

As with the New Politics, there is an intense recognition in medicine of the failure of the old scheme: to deal efficiently with a problem before it becomes a crisis. The population explosion, Morris explained at Silliman College last week, is just such a crisis; for it is our children who will share the world with thirty billion people, ten times the present population, and there are already a billion people living on marginal nutrition. 

This, he claimed, is the doctors' fault, for while they lowered the death rate, they showed no concern for the birth rate. The medical specialty of gynecology remained concerned only with obstetrics. Family planning and abortion are for the rich; we haven't even penetrated the ghettoes yet. 

In a New Haven study of 100 unwed mothers under the age of seventeen, the following was demonstrated for a five-year period: The mothers, only nine of whom were eventually married, gave birth to 340 babies, 238 of which were on the welfare roles. 95 percent of the mothers had more than one pregnancy, 60 percent in the first year, and 89 percent were of the ghetto population. A similar group in another state's study cost the government $20 million by the time they had reached thirty-five. 

Several years ago, birth control was a crime in Connecticut. In a test case sponsored by Yale-New Haven and several planned-parenthood groups, the law was thrown out. At the trial, however, each time a doctor rose to testify, officers of the court rose to save the delicate ears of those present and, in unison, raised and lowered the window shades, creating a clamor which made the testimony inaudible. 

Dr. Morris believes that abortion should be entirely a matter of the woman and her physician. (In communist nations, it is a woman's right to have an abortion if she so desires.) It should be taken off the criminal statutes, as has been done in Maryland, and all of the archaic sex laws, which are embarrassingly unenforceable anyway, should be flushed away. 

In order to deal with poverty, Morris believes, we will have to reduce the birth rate first. India recognized that they could not possibly build schools, create communities and produce food at a rate equaling the expansion of their population. The general revulsion to birth control fell; now there is a national policy for family planning. 

The question of religious ethics may not be as difficult to transcend as is presently believed. In Chile, where the population is predominantly Catholic, the doctors are inserting more intra-uterine devices proportionately than in New Haven; and at the moment, the IUD is the most effective birth control for poorly motivated populations. 

The liberalization of abortion laws remains the tensest debate. In the majority of the states the only legal means of terminating a pregnancy caused by rape is the "morning-after-pill," Dr. Morris's own contribution. It is a large dose of estrogens which causes the lining of the uterus to be unsuitable for implantation of the fertilized ovum. However, very few people are aware of this "pill," and thus we find yet another example of the need for a national standard of sex education. 

Unless the people of the world make a conscious educated effort to curb the population explosion, Morris said, we will see in our time federally policed population control. -----

**Title: Comfort**
**Author: Jim Mann**

Janis Joplin and Big Brother were discussing New Haven after their Saturday-night performance. 

"In some of the towns we play in, all of the girls wear bras, and in other towns, none of them do. In New Haven they all do. 

"I was surrounded by a lot of good-looking chicks tonight," said Janis, "but they all had their tits pointing straight out." 

She was drinking a bottle of Southern Comfort. Between her two performances, she had consumed one pint and had kicked away everyone within fifteen feet of her. During the second show, she openly cursed at the band. 

"Those cold drinks, sometimes you can't hold out on stage for more than thirty minutes a show. 

"Two years ago I used to love this stuff," Janis said, "but now ..." She coughed a little, her eyes watered over, and she sneezed three times. Turning to the guy next to her, she asked, "This doesn't have acid in it, does it? 

"Did you see me spit on stage in the second show? Never thought I'd have to do that. But you've got to if you want to drink and hit some of those notes. 

"I never was known for being too refined, anyway." 

A Yalie was downstairs admiring Janis. He had a little brown derby which Janis rested on her frizzy hair. 

"Can I have it'? Last night in Providence someone gave me a gigantic sculpture, an enormous penis. I'm going to put it in my living room." 

The Yalie asked Janis if he could come see her over Christmas. "I won't remember you then," she replied. "After a couple of hours in a performance, I start to forget, and then I don't remember anything until the next morning." 

Herb Wright, who promoted the performance, says that the performers will get $15,000 for the night, of which Janis personally will get about $8,000. 

"She's a greedy bitch," says Wright. 

Janis is going to leave the Holding Company some time within the next month and pick her own group. She has a few people lined up already, but won't commit herself about it. One of the people she tried to get was Eric Clapton, but that didn't work out. 

"I need real workers," she says. "I'm one of the hardest workers in the business right now."
