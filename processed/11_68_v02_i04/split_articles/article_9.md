Fragments of a Saturday afternoon 
by Jonathan Coppelman and Kenneth Cavander 
The bands of alumni in station wagons roll 
down Route 34, bowing to the altar-like 
facade of the Walter Camp Archway and 
moving across the road onto the grass. 
They eat their lunch beside parked auto-
mobiles as portable bars and picnic baskets 
magically produce sustenance for the 
game to come. The widespread use of 
liquor helps to break down the mind's 
resistance as these initiates try to get them-
selves totally smashed, that is totally in-
volved. There is a desire to recall the myths 
of an earlier time of racoon coats, hip 
flasks- "total belief." 

As they eat, in this prelude to the Ritual, 
the Bowl looms through the pillars like an 
enormous receptacle, its contents a mys-
tery. The many entrances to the bowl are 
like long dark tunnels-transitional pas-
sageways which clearly divide the game 
world from their daily lives-rites de pas-
sage moving these initiates from the real 
into the surreal. A burst of color at the end 
and they are born again. 

When these followers of the game finally 
manage to tear themselves away from their 
banquet, they move in a long procession 
into the stadium. The seats are assigned; 
even in this mass event there is careful 
control and situation of participants. There 
is an unusual amount of contact among 
people, who sit on long, wooden planks. 
The contact of the bodies creates a circuit 
that seems to run around the stadium.

London Times, has written television 
screenplays for the BBC and has been as-
sociated with both the Royal Shakespeare 
Company and the Royal Court Theatre. 
He presently teaches in the classics depart-
ment as well as the Drama School. His 
adaptation of The Bacchae will be pro-
duced by the Yale Re~rtory Theatre in 
March. 

The Stadium. The task is to create a uni-
fied, self-contained, completely autono-
mous setting for violence, in which the 
spectators face the opponent's followers 
across the field. In between the two 
groups is the zone (the killing zone) where 
the game takes place. The design both 
separates the two groups and unites them 
in a common interest. The symmetry of 
the field with its clear, even demarcations, 
marks the exclusive area where the vio-
lence will occur. 

Through different sight lines and a dif-
ferent relationship of spectator to event, 
the focus of energies could be dispersed 
throughout the crowd, creating an enor-
mously explosive situation. In this less in-
sulated structure the opposing factions 
might tear each other apart. Thus the de-
sign of the present Bowl manifests an 
ancient understanding. 

Football is a completely autonomous 
world, totally self-contained. It has its own 
limits of space and corresponding bound-
aries of time. The game is played in four 
15-minute quarters-an arbitrary but 
rigidly enforced span; the space is one 
hundred yards of grass, marked off in five-
yard intervals. 

In this autonomous world, the players 
are identified through certain conventional 
characteristics. By the nature of the Ritual, 
these characteristics help the spectators 
bridge the gulf between the idealized 
world of their heroes and their own un-
glamorous existence. Through identifica-
tion they can share in the exploits of the 
players. 

First the players are given a number, 
for immediate identification in the course 
of the afternoon's events: success, mis-
take, injury. Second, place of birth and 
education: the origin and roots of Sat-
urday's heroes, with a slight suggestion of 
the sources of development which led the 
heroes to move beyond the limitations of 
ordinary men. The players from far away, 
vague territories (Wyoming, Ohio) are the 
most interesting.

The final and most-observed character-
istic is size: Bigness is a central mystique 
in football; the players for the most part 
must be bigger than life, for the experience 
they engage in is extraordinary, clearly of 
a different magnitude than daily life on 
campus. Aside from their practical use, 
shoulder pads and helmets enhance the size 
of the players and create an impersonal, 
ritualized appearance-the equipment in 
football is more imposing and impersonal 
than that of any other competitive sport. 
The pattern of action is as follows: one 
party tries to open holes into which a mem-
ber projects himself; the opposing role 
players respond by attempting to close any 
such holes and knock down the intruder, 
who tries to remain erect as long as pos-
sible. The conventions of blocking and 
tackling, the methodology of advancing 
the ball, involve an aggressive relation to 
an opposite member-a basic pattern of 
penetration-response rooted in the sexual 
act itself. 

With all their size and strength we have 
only a very slight sense of the heroes' 
vulnerability. Clearly, these men are mor-
tal. Achilles had his heel, the halfback his 
ankle, the quarterback his knee--everyone 
is susceptible to injury, and it seems the 
best players are in the most precarious po-
sition: as the toeam's fortunes rest largely 
on their well-being, they are singled out 
for attack by the opposing forces. 

"KILL 81 !" they chant as an overzeal-
ous defender crunches the home hero five 
yards out of bounds. There are severe 
limits to the application of force, and the 
opposing player has violated them. But 
the coach simply whisks the player out of 
of the game; once out of play, he is out 
of reach, untouchable, and in some sense 
no longer real. The crowd remembers him 
and invokes vengeance for a short while. 
But concentration always returns to the 
given moment, and memory is short-lived. 

The half-time is a completely failed ex-
perience. It is an attempt at comic relief, 
somewhat like the satyr play used in 
Greek tragedy. The contrived, sophomoric 
quality of the humor is simply contrasted . 
to the heroic magnitude of the event that 
surrounds it. The marching formations 
and the irony are simply inadequate to the 
energies focused upon them-energies de-
rived from the game that surrounds the 
half-time show. In attempting to fill a void 
(the time-space continuum of the game 
itself is suspended), the bands simply call 
attention to the void and make it obvious 
that the low-comic organization of numer-
ous people in formation is non-heroic. 

Late in the game a malaise permeates 
the supporters, though their team leads 
by many points. There is a feeling of some 
vague, immense failure. Winning was not 
the fruition, the culmination it is supposed 
to be. Conversation turns from the game 
to the parties and dancing to follow. The 
game itself is only part of a series of ex-
periences designed to regenerate the body. 

The football weekend is rooted in the 
week that precedes it. It comes out of the 
monastic structure of the life with its tight-
ly organized time, its ascetic demands and 
continual self-denials. All week the in-
dividual must repress an entire aspect of 
his existence in order to survive and excel. 
The football week-end is a direct response 
to the week-an opposite generated by five 
days of insanely regimented existence. The 
weekend must be everything that the 
week is not: free, sensual, erotic. A time 
for the body. 

We know that Greek theater, perhaps all 
theater, began as a fertility rite, to make 
the grapes grow. What happened-people 
went out into the fields and had an orgy, 
and then they said to the grapes, "Go on, 
now you do it!" and that way they hoped 
the crops would keep coming up year after 
year and not die every fall. And out of 
this came theater. It's a ritual, basically, 
theater-a ritual in which we all go out 
into the field and get smashed. tolE
