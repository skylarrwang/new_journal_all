international position makes these visions 
and the consequent "irrationality" almost a 
necessity. The "pragmatists"-embodied 
in the pilloried Chief of State Liu Shao-ch'i 
--cannot win over the ideologues as long 
as China's margin of survival seems pre-
carious to Chinese. The belligerent posture 
of the United States and the Soviet have in 
my opinion been a prime factor in tipping 
the balance in favor of redness and non-
rational psychism over calm, evolutionary 
pragmatic professionalism. It is worth re-
membering that the first great burst of 
Chinese "irrationality" coincided with the 
advance of troops under the command of 
General Douglas MacArthur to the Yalu 
River reservoirs and the Manchurian 
frontier. 

Thus far, the outside world has been for-
tunate. The threats and pressures of out-
side powers have led to internal convulsion 
only. Chinese foreign policy has been 
marked by extreme caution. But if our 
present attitudes continue, we may face 
psychism in Chinese foreign policy, with 
the consequent death not only of the Chi-
nese revolution but of the human race.

trapped by them. And a person who is 
trapped is never simple, never without a 
certain inner tension. 

In making for The Hostage the series of 
choices that constitute a director's inter-
pretation of a play, Charles Maryan has 
consistently chosen the tamer and simpler 
way. Bunny Cohn's quiet ferocity and 
Drew Denbaum's placidy Irish observance 
of the passing world are competent per-
formances taken for themselves. The hos-
tage himself (Perry King) and the IRA offi-
cer (Jeff Pressman) play only slightly be-
low the level of intensity that seems called 
for by the situation and the script. No one 
of these interpretations would make a tame 
play, but together they systematically pull 
the play's teeth. 

Behan is more careless of the sharp 
side of the play than any production can 
afford to be. He lets the seriousness of the 
situation go unmentioned for such long 
stretches of playing around that when the 
claws do come out, they have to be felt. 

A friend of Behan's once commented, 
"Brendan would drop his trousers in 
church for a laugh." Little that is sacred 
to the Irish is sacred in the same way to an 
Â· American audience, and the Dramat has 
not managed to overcome the culture gap. 

Their production is more like someone 
opening his fly in a railroad station. Amus-
ing if you're in on it, but not shocking, 
not a real gas.

Letters 
To The New Journal: 
Come off it, Bonnie McGregor! Your 
highly personalized and warped impres-
sions of the life of a Yale female graduate 
student don't deserve a serious refutation. 
Chop down your self-constructed pedestal, 
cultivate your deprived sense of humor, 
relax and enjoy a good thing.
