"How can a pragmatic people like the 
Chinese have gone off the deep end this 
way?" asks a Yale undergraduate, reflect-
ing in his question a stereotype of Chinese 
"character" that is widespread among in-
telligent and generally well-informed 
Americans. "I am beginning to think that 
there was something after all to the old 
idea of the Yellow Peril," writes an alum-
nus of ten years ago who had thought, 
until the Great Proletarian Cultural Revo-
lution, that the Chinese were working 
things out in their own incomprehensible 
ways but that the rest of the world could 
probably live with the result.


For many of the middle-aged and 
older who felt personally involved in the 
Chinese civil war, old wounds have been 
reopened and debates of forty years' stand-
ing revived.


For one group, the events of the past 
three years have been the final working-
out of a tragedy with themes that were 
clear from the beginning. For another, 
these same events have undercut the fight 
of a lifetime to bring the Chinese commun-
ist movement under a rational light, in the 
expectation that tensions could be eased 
if Americans could only understand.


To the new radical youth of the West, 
the Chinese Cultural Revolution has posed 
different but no less divisive problems. 
Glancing fragments of Maoism are picked 
up out of context wherever a group senses 
an empathy with what it finds: the open 
horizons of romantic anarchism, intense 
discipline and struggle in the name of vary-
ing ends, young "wanderers" playing 
chess in the sunshine as others argue the 
issues of life and death. There is no more 
effort to put Maoism in its own setting 
than there is to reconcile these rationally . 
opposed goals. Neither history nor linear 
logic is considered relevant.


These varying reactions to the Cultural 
Revolution have one thing in common: 
they stem from a continuing Western self-
preoccupation-individual or collective 
-with our problems. We condemn the ad-
ministration, both major parties, or-
ganized business and organized labor for 
refusing to attempt to get beneath the 
surface of what is happening in China, for 
projecting their hopes and fears onto a 
screen and calling it China. Yet much of 
the academic and serious journalistic 
writing on China today suffers from pre-
cisely this flaw, Jess crudely expos~. In a 
shrinking world more than one-quarter of 
which is Chinese, this dominance of old 
assumptions reflects a failure of the im-
agination, a rigidity and inadaptability to 
altered circumstances that portends catas-
trophe.


Dr. Lifton's superb essay points the way 
to a fresh examination that makes these 
sterile preoccupations irrelevant. It is not 
the first study of the Cultural Revolution; 
easily a hundred serious and substantial 
articles on the subject have been pub-
lished. The author has taken account of 
these without attempting to summarize 
them. The seminal importance of this 
book lies in the way questions are formu-
lated and possible answers suggested.


Probing into fundamentals, it is an essay 
which no specialist can ignore and which 
at the same time offers an excellent spring-
board into the study of contemporary 
China for thoughtful adults with little 
background on the subject.


The central question is this: The Chinese 
have a millennia! record of the highest 
accomplishment in every field of human 
endeavor, a record of an ability to disci-
pline their vast energies toward millenary 
goals. The Chinese tradition of dealing 
with crises of politics, technology and 
nature through psychic cultivation, based 
on a belief in the malleability and teach-
ability of man is today reinforced by 
China's need for the highest morale and 
discipline. Yet paradoxically, Mao's su-
preme effort to this end, the Cultural 
Revolution, has ended in a paralyzing loss 
of discipline and morale. Why did Mao 
try anything so fantastic and what effects 
may we anticipate?


Dr. Lifton scarcely mentions problems 
of politics (in the usual sense), economics 
or social structure. He recognizes their 
importance but argues convincingly that 
we have been bewildered by a welter of 
specific but disjointed data on these sub-
jects because we have not looked at the 
problems of psychohistory, which in his 
view underlie the present Chinese social 
structure or any other. He attaches no real 
importance to the rumors of personal 
cliques and their favoritisms and quarrels 
-rumors that pre-empt most of the little 
space the American press can spare for 
news of China. He is basically concerned 
with two main questions: the contours of 
Mao's personality as a revolutionary lead-
er and the psychohistorical dynamics of 
the Cultural Revolution. He treats these 
not only as problems of a specific time and 
place but also as illustrations of pheno-
mena that may shed light on individual 
and group behavior in all times and places.


The central theme of the treatment both 
of Mao and of the Cultural Revolution 
is revolutionary immortality: the passion-
ate conviction that the lives and deaths 
of the pioneer generation of guerrilla 
revolutionary leaders will be meaning-
less unless they live on in a continuing 
uninterrupted revolution that returns per-
ennially to its sources in the Chinese 
countryside. Dr. Lifton does not argue that 
this is the only theme one could choose. 
"Large historical events cannot be attrib-
uted to a single c<tuse, nor grapsed by a 
single explanation." I am persuaded by 
this book, however, that the compulsion to 
find revolutionary immortality is prob-
ably the most significant element in the 
Cultural Revolution. It is certainly the 
freshest and one which no scholar other 
than Dr. Lifton could have formulated.


Who else can use psychological and psy-
choanalytic concepts without being con-
stricted by them, finding his science no 
more infallible than others, and is at the 
same time versed in history and intimately 
familiar with Chinese (and Japanese) re-
actions to the problems they and their cul-
tures face?


Dr. Lifton deliberately avoids discus-
sion of Mao's sharp conflict with his father, 
for that would lead to a full psycho-
biography of Mao. He finds the theme of 
conquering death more central than the 
Oedipus complex to the development of 
the heroic personality. The reader will find 
here staggering evidence, in brief com-
pass, on Mao's repeated escapes as his 
wife, son and old comrades were killed in 
action. Mao's reactions to this cumula-
tive experience became comprehensible 
when viewed as illustrations of survivor-
guilt. To overcome this guilt, and in-
creasingly with age to find the end of all 
men's rainbows, Mao has sought revolu-
tionary immortality not merely as a legend 
-although he has long since been one-
but as part of a revolutionary process that 
can be immortal only if it continues and 
accelerates.


Hence the re-emergence as early as 1957 
of the idea of permanent or uninterrupted 
revolution and the inauguration at that 
time of the Great Leap Forward-an effort 
to vault over the stages of development 
in the history of other countries and to 
achieve overnight by sheer will-power not 
just what it has taken other countries gen-
erations to accomplish, but far more, and 
to use each new peak of triumph as a 
base for the assault on a higher peak, on 
into the infinite future.


After the Great Leap Forward in the 
late 1950s failed, why then, after a brief 
period of relaxation, did Mao and his in-
ner circle feel impelled to order a far more 
daring leap, the Cultural Revolution? To 
Dr. Lifton, this decision was not a symp-
tom of madness in any clinical sense nor of 
senility, and certainly not the product of 
the intrigues of wives. He suggests that 
Mao, facing certain and possibly imminent 
biological death, despite his show of swim-
ming the Yangtze at age 72, became ob-
sessed with symbolic immortality. The rev-
olution must go on, yet the younger gen-
eration knew guerilla warfare only as 
history, tens of thousands of technocrats 
struggled with problems that did not lend 
themselves to solution by struggle and self-
criticism, and even Party cadres were 
settling into established routines.


It should be :remembered that the gov-
ernment apparatus, dominated by Liu 
Shao-ch'i's "right-wingers," had been re-
sponsible for the first Five Year Plan and 
for tremendous gains in most spheres of 
public and private life. But the free criti-
cism invited during the Hundred Flowers 
Period resulted .in open expressed demands 
for uninhibited, self-propelled develop-
ment in all the arts; systematic, "bour-
geois" scientific procedures in scholarship; 
more consumer goods and some little 
pleasures and comforts in life. As one 
worker put it, a hard day's work, a good 
dinner with wine and to bed with my wife. 
This was the end of the Maoist dream: 
embourgeoisement.


To keep the whole picture in proportion, 
Dr. Lifton might also have noted that fur-
ther forced-draft development was prob-
ably necessary before most Chinese could 
reap any such rewards and that the foreign 
policies of both the Soviet Union and the 
United States gave credible grounds for 
what many outsiders have interpreted as 
paranoid fears of foreign attack.


The party apparatus had been in charge 
of the Great Leap that failed. With State 
and Party machinery both compromised, 
Mao turned to the People's Liberation 
Army, a living reminder of the glorious 
tradition of the revolution. He also ap-
pealed directly to the very young, not only 
youths but children, to form themselves 
into Red Guards and to smash the "re-
visionists," "capitalists" and other enemies 
of the immortal revolution. With schools 
closed, the young roamed the country, 
finding enemies everywhere-in state, 
Party and army.


Mao's solution was to open all the flood-
gates and loose the revolutionary fervor of 
the very young, whipped to a fever, against 
what had become a revolutionary estab-
lishment: 
"In place of his formerly sensitive applica-
tions of personal passions to China's des-
perate historical experience, we encounter a 
misplaced faith in his own psychic state, a 
substitution of his own psychic history for his-
tory at large. Because he and a few around 
him fear the death of the revolution, China 
must be made to convulse."


Dr. Lifton does not argue that Mao's in-
trapsychic struggles fully explain the 
course of the Chinese revolution since 
Mao's ascendancy in 1935 or its latest 
phase, the Cultural Revolution. What he 
does argue is that "they now spread con-
fusion and antagonism rather than the 
illumination they had in the past." It is im-
portant to remember that this very drive 
toward the unattainable, this "psych ism" 
in Maoist thought-the belief that the sub-
jective can overcome the objective-has 
always been an essential factor in what is, 
aJI in all, the spectacular success story of 
the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Com-
munist Party has used every resource at its 
command, but it early discovered that lack-
ing economic incentives, psychological 
incentives could literally work wonders.


Claims that the "thought of Mao Tse-
tung" has been responsible for everything 
from the victory of the Chinese team in 
an international table tennis tournament to 
the development of thermonuclear wea-
pons have been greeted with derision 
abroad. Yet Dr. Lifton quotes the presi-
dent of the United States Table Tennis As-
sociation: 
"The writings and spirit of Mao invade every 
match the Chinese play. The national team, 
before beginning play, recite Mao quotations 
to give them courage, and in the middle of a 
tense game a Chinese crowd will often chant 
Mao's sayings to spur their heroes on. It has 
a terrific psychological effect, seeming to 
drive them to feats of endurance and other 
exceptional efforts."


Table tennis is a vivid but trivial example. 
The record of the Chinese revolution is 
full of well attested instances where the 
words of Mao have literally inspired men 
to achieve what observers declared impos-
sible. The point these observers missed is 
the "psychism" (something considerably 
more potent than the extreme voluntarist 
strain in European Marxist thought) that 
Dr. Lifton finds central to Maoism and the 
Cultural Revolution. The achievements, 
in his view, are almost enough to "take the 
fallacy out of the psychistic fallacy."


Almost, but not quite. This extraordi-
nary leader, building on an age-old heri-
tage of belief in the central importance of 
the indoctrinated mind in governing man 
and nature, can evoke responses that lead 
to quadrupled effort; but he faces modern 
technology. He may-perhaps must-be-
lieve that through his ideology his "pure" 
young followers can become "absolute 
conquerers of men, technology and death."


For Mao is both attracted to technology 
and repelled by its social consequences. 
An outmoded factory may multiply its out-
put if devoted men not only give all their 
strength but all their minds to doing the 
best possible job with the means available. 
Manpower may be harnessed to build 
dams in record time. But although high 
morale never hurt a physicist or an econ-
omist, Dr. Lifton regards it as patently 
absurd to regard China's achievement in 
nuclear physics as a result of political in-
doctrination or "to treat capital formation 
as a type of guerilla warfare."


These are the factors behind the recur-
rent "Red and Expert" controversy. Is it 
more important to be a zealous believer 
("red") or to develop professional compe-
tence? A country of "red experts" is the 
ultimate but unattainable goal, and so the 
official line has swung at intervals from one 
extreme of encouraging expertise and 
telling the cadres to leave the professionals 
in peace to work, to the other of proudly 
declaring that redness is expertise: "The 
redder the more expert."


Dr. Lifton relates this tension to the ten-
sion in Chinese history between "essence" 
and "function" (t'i-yung). He does not be-
lieve that "redness and expertise" can be 
combined without mutual transformation, 
any more than the reformers of the cen-
tury preceeding Mao succeeded in using 
the t'i-yung formulation as a way of rising 
to the Western challenge without accept-
ing the implications behind that challenge. 
The idea of "Chinese values as the founda-
tion or essence, Western skills for prac-
tical or functional use" (Chung-hsiieh wei 
t'i, hsi-hsiieh-wei yung) led to a long and 
tortuous tragedy that achieved neither of 
its goals.


Dr. Lifton seems to me to be saying that 
although the Cultural Revolution was 
bound to fail, it was not an anomaly and it 
should not have come as a surprise. Nor 
are Mao's pronouncements the ravings of 
an aged madman. both represent the new-
est and most extreme of a series of efforts 
of the true believers to couple the pure 
hearts and bare hands of the Chinese peas-
antry with twenty-first century technology. 
This particular effort has failed, but we 
do not yet see the technocrats back in con-
trol, in spite of the efforts t9 pacify and 
discipline aroused youth and to restore the 
authority of the Party. I suspect that what 
Dr. Lifton repeatedly refers to as "im-
mortalizing visions" are likely to recur. 
Their roots lie deep in several strata of 
Chinese tradition. Further, and here I dis-
agree with Dr. Lifton, China's present
