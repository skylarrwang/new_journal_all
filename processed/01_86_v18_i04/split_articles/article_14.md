prosecutor, Assistant State Attorney 
Mary Galvin, disrupted the display of 
support and began the proceedings by 
loudly proclaiming, "Gladys Faulk is 
not a battered woman." 

Peering through her round glasses, 
Galvin introduced the facts with an air 
of self-confidence and a slight tone of 
sarcasm, intending to destroy any 
image of Faulk as a weak and helpless 
abused woman. Galvin claimed that 
Faulk "has a prior criminal record for a 
felonious assault against her own sister 
in 1973, as well as two other incidents 
on her record. This is the fourth time 
she has appeared before a court." 

Galvin waved her hand about as she 
went on to e.stablish Faulk as a violent 
person and to dispel any initial sym-
pathy battered women usually receive: 
"Faulk's relationship with Smith was a 
tumultuous one with violence on both 
sides. Of all the police reports, only 
one recorded injuries, and those were 
to Smith. Faulk hit him over the head 
with a flower pot." Galvin's voice 
drowned out the murmuring in the 
court as she began to depict vividly 
Smith's injuries. "There were four stab 
wounds, not one. There was one on his 
~ight hand, clearly a defensive wound, 
and three on his back. Evidently these 
wounds were not inflicted in self-
defense," she pronounced. 

Galvin 
also 
meticulously 
emphasized the inconsistency of 
Faulk's testimony in police reports 
concerning the stabbing. "First she said 
it happened in the kitchen. Later she 
claimed it happened as he was 
leaving." _:rhen Galvin concluded just 
as abruptly as 
she had begun. 
"Although it may not have been 
premeditated murder, 
Faulk did 
intend to injure Smith. She poses a 
threat to the community and should be 
removed." With that she sat down with 
her back squarely facing the 
courtroom. 

The prosecutor had attempted to 
show that Faulk's history and the 
specifics of the case prove her to be a 
violent criminal rather than a 
vulnerable battered woman. But 
speaking next, Diane Polan, Faulk's 
defense attorney, began to transform 
Faulk's image into a diligent, caring 
woman who was frightened by the very 
real threat of an obsessed man. Unlike 
Galvin, Polan appeared more com-
fortable in court. She called on witness 
after witness to give their personal 
accounts of Faulk, in an effort to create 
a positive, sympathetic image. 

One witness, Doris Thorpe, a night 
nurse administrator at Yale-New 
Haven for 37 years and Faulk's im-
mediate supervi.sor for five years, 
assured the court of both Faulk's 
patience and her harrassment by 
Smith. Although Faulk worked a 
demanding midnight to eight a.m. 
shift with the sick, the aged, and 
undoubtedly some high-strung and 
impatient doctors, "she never once lost 
her temper and there have never been 
any complaints from hospital staff or 
patients about her," according to 
Thorpe. She went on to verify Faulk's 
abuse. "She had come to work one 
night with 5trangle marks on her throat 
and signs of being punched." When 
asked if Faulk was afraid of Smith, 
Thorpe immediately replied, as if 
insulted by such an obvious question, 
"Yes, definitely." 

Another friend of Faulk's, Julie 
Castella, a young woman whom Faulk 
had supported for a year because of a 
family problem, informed the court 
that despite the frustrations Faulk must 
encounter being a single mother of 
two, "I never once witnessed any 
violence toward the children. If they 
got into a fight, they talked it out." 

Others told of the numerous part-time 
jobs Faulk held in addition to her 
hospital job so she could send her 
14-year-old-daughter, 
Beatrice, 
to 
parochial school. Some mentioned the 
volunteer work Faulk did at the school 
her seven-year-old son Robert attends. 

An especially important witness, 
child psychologist Dr. Edward H. 
Futterman, emphasized Faulk's close 
relationship with her children and the 
impact her incarceration might have 
on them. "Beatrice is a highly depen-
dent girl who is almost pr,.otective of 
her mother," Futterman exclaimed. 
"She declared that she 'would just quit' 
if her mother 
were 
imprisoned." 

Futterman described 
Robert 
as 
"extremely vulnerable," and 
he 
mentioned that 
he had indicated 
suicidal tendencies. 

After letting the witnesses present a 
positive view of Faulk, Polan herself 
refuted 
the prosecutor's 
denial of 
Faulk's status as a battered woman. 
"Clearly this was a battering situation," 
Polan concluded. "Her inability to 
extricate herself from the situation she 
was in is a typical characteristic in all 
battered woman cases." · Then she 
reminded the judge, "incarceration is 
only justified if a person is a threat to 
the community or if the community 
demands retribution." 

Polan had 
attempted to show Faulk's qualities, 
that the community supported Faulk, 
and that not even Smith's relatives 
demanded retribution. According to 
Polan, Faulk's case didn't meet either 
of the qualifications for imprisonment. 

Superior Court judge Frank J. 
Kinney disagreed. Without even a


short break after the lengthy defense, 
he had made a decision. He let out a 
frustrated breath and said in a quiet 
voice which could easily be heard in 
the motionless room, "I'm not satisfied 
that this is a battered woman. Several 
facts are disturbing. She has support in 
the community, yet these witnesses are 
not relying on objective facts but on 
M rs. Faulk's version of what hap-
pened. I'm aware of the impact my 
decision may have on the children, and 
I 
regret it, but some period of 
impr isonment 
is necessary." He 
pronounced a sentence of two and a 
half years in jail followed by about 
eight years probation. 

The judge's voice was immediately 
muffied by commotion. Amidst all the 
movement and noise, however, one 
figure remained stationary: Robert, 
Faulk's wide-eyed son. His apparent 
state of shock and silent tears probably 
came not so much out of an under-
standing of what had happened and the 
impact it would have on him, but as a 
response to his sister's hysteria and his 
own fright at seeing adults in tears. 

Yet one dramatic courtroom scene 
may not be sufficient to explain all the 
ambiguities inherent in Faulk's case. 
Later, speaking with Polan at her 
office, am idst numerous plants and 
polit ical 
posters, 
more subtle 
complexities emerged. 

originally agreed to defend Faulk after 
Faulk's friends learned of the lawyer's 
reputation for representing battered 
women and requested her assistance. 
Polan, '73, Law '80, is one of four in 
New H aven's only all-women law firm, 
Levine and Polan, which she describes 
as "a politically progressive, feminist 
law office." As water leaked through 
the roof of her homey office above 
Charlie's Place, she addressed some of 
the prosecutor's statements and 
examined their implications. 

Polan initially elaborated on one of 
the 
most condemning arguments 
against Faulk: the felonious assault on 
her sister. Polan explained, "This 
assault was 12 years ago. She was 
visiting her sister in New Haven, and 
she lived in South Carolina. They were 
both drinking, and the sister accused 
her of flirting with her boyfriend, 
which 
wasn't true. There was a 
physical fight in which the sister was on 
top of Gladys, and G ladys picked up a 
bottle and cut her sister with it. She 
ended up pleading guilty not really 
understanding that there were conse-
quences." 

According to Polan, the seriousness 
of the charges against Faulk and the 
handling of the incident in 1973 are an 
example of "the class and race bias of 
the system." In 1973, if Faulk had been 
able to afford better counsel or if she 
had had the time to resolve the 
problem instead of returning to her job 
for fear oflosing it, she may have been 
able to get the charges against her 
reduced or dropped. If she were white, 
someone might have been sympathetjc 
and tried to protect her record, and she 
would not have pleaded guilty to the 
charge. In addition, Polan implied that 
many 
people even 
subconsciously 
stereotype blacks by associating them 
with 
low economic 
status, 
little 
education, and societal problems. She 
pointed out, "When the judge said 'I 
know about these love/hate relation-
ships,' I think he was expressing his 
own subconscious notions about the 
kind of relationships that go on among 
people who are poor and of a lower 
social class than he is. This association 
between black people and a violent 
way of living reflects race and class 
bias." 

Eight 
years 
ago Francine 
Hughes was acquitted on grounds of 
temporary insanity. Perhaps there was 
a sympathetic attitude toward this white 
woman that did not exist toward 
Faulk. 

The role of race and class in Faulk's 
case is subtle, and some will even deny 
that it exists. But the double standard 
in the court system concerning abused 
women is almost blatant. The justice 
system, all levels of it, has disregarded


the seriousness of domestic violence for 
a long time. Since the system doesn't 
prevent abuse from recurring, many 
women have no alternative but to 
handle the situation as best they can. 
But this leads to the danger of 
condemnation by our society and by the 
very system in which they sought 
refuge. 

Gladys Faulk defended 
herself against Jackson Smith by 
fighting back, leading the court to 
perceive the relationship as mutually 
violent. Because she resisted abuse, 
confusion arose over the definition of a 
"battered woman" in the Faulk case. 

Polan said, "I think that was the most 
pernicious part of what the prosecutor 
did: to get up and say this isn't a 
battered woman because she fought 
back, that the whole definition of 
battered is that you have to sit back 
and be a victim- if you fight back you 
are no longer a battered woman. If 
you're a victim and you act like a 
victim, you get a lot of sympathy- you 
might be dead, you might be in the 
hospital-but you get sympathy. I 
think the message is 'let the guy break 
your bones, end up in' the hospital, but 
if you fight back you're the one who's 
going to end up in jail, not him.' And I 
think its a real tragedy." 

Undoubtedly, it is unfortunate when 
anyone, but especially a ·mother of 
two, attempts to free herself from 
abuse and then serves time in jail for it. 
Yet, how much blame for the situation 
rests on the individual and how much 
on our society and its justice system? 

The Defense Committee for Gladys 
Faulk thinks they know the answer to 
this question. They feel Judge Kinney 
misinterpreted and overlooked many 
aspects of the case. The committee has 
distributed a 
letter throughout 
Connecticut asking for supporters to 
write Kinney in protest. For others, 
the answer lies in a belief or disbelief in 
the subtle biases and stereotypes of 
race, class, and gender within the 
judicial system.
