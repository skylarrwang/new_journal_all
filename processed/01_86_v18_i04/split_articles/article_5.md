Unfinished Stories
To the Editor:
The most surprising thing about james
Ledbetter's piece, "AlA: Should They
Patrol the Classrooms?" is that The
New journal published it without even
making the effort to substantiate his
chilling "revelations."

A few points in this stunning "ex-
pose" are worth a second look. "At one
point," Ledbetter writes, "Csorba
pulled from his file cabinet what he
called his 'secret target list' of radical
professors." At the end of the same
paragraph, he writes, "I asked Csorba
how he compiled the list; he told me he
took it from a list of faculty who had
endorsed a rally opposing U.S. in-
volvement in Central America." Two
things call Ledbetter's account into
question.

The list he is referring to is, as I told
him, a published document entitled,
"A National Appeal for Peace with
Justice in Central America." It is an
open letter protesting U.S. interven-
tion in Central America. The list was
compiled, then, by the signatories
themselves, and then released to the
public. When a copy was sent to me, I
kept it in our correspondence file. I
showed it to Ledbetter because it il-
lustrates the extent of political activity
among leftist profesors.

On the front of the list, in typeset,
there is a plea for peace and a dove
bearing an olive branch- hardly the
design I would have selected for my lit-
tle hit list. Another interesting point is
that none of the people criticized in our
monthly newspaper,
The
Campus
Report, are on that list whose existence
Ledbetter has since revealed to the
world.

Another illustration of Ledbetter's
lack of integrity concerns a course
syllabus he showed us during his visit,
which I've kept as well. It is from a
class he himself was taking at Yale en-
titled "Marxist Dialectic and Rhetoric."
Presumably, he brought the syllabus
along to get our reaction to it, and in-
deed we gave it a quick look. But
Ledbetter doesn't record our reactions,
and I think I know the reason. When he
showed it to us, we pointed out that the
reading list included Arthur Koestler's
The God that Failed, and we promptly
dismissed Ledbetter's suggestion that
the course was weighted with Marxist
propaganda. But this awkward little ex-
change just didn't fit into his "expose."

Ledbetter has a literary reporting
style which leans heavily on dialogue
and direct quotations. How did he get
them at such length? He didn't take
notes as we spoke, and he doesn't men-
tion a tape recorder. In the article he
informs us in passing that, "Some time
(later),
I
excused myself to the
bathroom to scribble notes of our con-
versation." We had a two or three hour
conversation, and "some time" after it
was over he scratched out these sup-
posedly incriminating comments word
for word. Think about it. There were
12 verbatim quotations-adding up to
some 170 words- based on notes hasti-
ly scribbled out in a bathroom stall.
That boy has amazing recall.

Another comical detail
in
Ledbetter's account has me watching
Battle for the Planet of the Apes, upon
his return from composing in the
bathroom. In his attempt to make me
look silly, I'm afraid he only shows
what a dishonest man he is. When he
walked in I was rewinding a recently
recorded McNeil/Lehrer debate on
AlA, and every time I stopped the
tape, on came the apes. Ledbetter
himself had expressed an interest in
seeing the tape. Again, your in-
vestigative reporter sacrificed the truth
for a laugh at our expense.

"Once the accusation is made,"
Ledbetter concludes, "substantiated or
not, a professor's reputation is already
tarnished." Good point. And this leads
me to ask again why nobody from The
New Journal ever called me to substan-
tiate all these accusations. The irony is
pretty obvious. You express your fears
that AlA might publish false and un-
substantiated stories on professors
-which we have never done- and
then proceed to publish a false and
unsubstantiated "expose" on AlA.
Les Csorba, III
Executive Director, AlA

jim Ledbetter responds:
Csorba's details about his list confirm a ma-
jor point of my article: Accuracy in Academia
gives its student "monitors" the names of
allegedly leftist professors to target. Prior to
my article, Accuracy in Academia frequently
denied in public that this was their aim (see
Reed Irvine's letter to the editor, The New
Republic, Dec. 23). Furthermore, these
targeted individuals are being harassed for
political beliefs expressed outside of the
classroom, not for "inaccuracies" inside. One
of these «professors" that Csorba instructed me
to target is not only no longer at Yale, she
was never even on the faculty here; she held an
administrative position. The idea that sign-
ing an open letter on a broad political issue
such as Central America can lead to red-
baiting in the name of "accuracy» ought to
give all of us pause.

My article contains seven quotations from
Csorba and Scully taken from our meeting-
all other citations come from telephone conver-
sations, during which I took careful notes.
Our meeting lasted two hours, and I wrote
down the word-for-word quotes about 90
minutes through the meeting. Given that the
purpose of my visit to AlA's office was
precisely to gather such verbatim material,
and that I was concentrating accordingly, I
do not consider this an extraordinary feat of
memory.

It is typical of AlA that Csorba's letter ad-·
dresses none of the substance of my article,
only those portions which made him appear
foolish. I understand that Csorba's project is
to cover up the group's ideological purposes,
but he is sadly mistaken if he thinks that the
biggest problem with AlA is whether or not
employees watch · TV movies on company
time.


Another Other Side
To the Editors:
In her recent article "The Other Side of
Brunch" (TN],
12/6/85), Tamar
Lehrich used my statements to support
her claim that "because of the
economic and social differences which
emerge once students put on their blue
uniforms, workers often resent those
whom they have to serve."

In point of fact, I know of no in-
stances in which the economic dif-


ferences among student workers have
caused resentment or hostility; indeed,
due to the extreme diversity of the
economic backgrounds of student
workers, financial status fails to con-
stitute an issue at all.

Ms.
Lehrich's assumptions that
because we work we are poor, or that
because we earn money we resent
those who do not, are misconceptions
that would have been dispelled with
objective investigation. Instead, my
words were taken entirely out of con-
text to substantiate Ms. Lehrich's inac-
curate preconceptions.

Considerate Kennedys
I read the December issue of The New
journal while listening to records.
When I saw "Sound Effects," by Jen
Fleissner (p. 4), I paused and grabbed
the nearest album: "Warning," it said
on the cover. "The inside fold-out to
this record cover is a work of art by
H. R. Giger that some people may
find shocking, repulsive or offensive."
So why is this piece of trash in there?
"Life can sometimes be that way," it
continued. I never knew the Dead
Kennedys could be so considerate
(without PMRC, no less).
S. Fraidin
P.S. It was quite a repulsive fold-out.

Issues of Neutrality
I would like to respond to the article,
"Bridging the Gap" (TN], 10/11/85).
Let me begin by stating my position on
the subject. Throughout the course of
the strike I considered myself a neutral
student who believed in the Union's
right to
strike as
well
as
the
University's stance in negotiations. It
is important to know where people
stand when they discuss an issue with
which they've previously been involved.
The New Journal has failed to do this.

The union article was written by
Melissa Turner and Jay Carney.
While I am not aware of Turner's
stance during the strike, I know that
Carney was a vocal student activist.
He picketed Commons, took part in
various union activities, and was even
on the front page of the Yale Daily News
when he helped stage a sit-in at CCL to
protest library schedule changes.

I have no objections to these ac-
tivities, but once Carney puts his
byline on an article, the reader should
know about them. Carney's union
sympathies were not mentioned at the
end of the article, only that he was a
junior in T.D. The fact that Carney is
not an unbiased journalist would
change the way one reads the article.

Consider the description of ad-
ministration official Jack Siggins. Sig-
gins, we learn, "sits in his well-lit and
spacious office overlooking the court-
yard." The article later states that
"although Unionists might describe
Siggins and his wife as tyrants, they
keep such characteristics well hidden."
According to Carney, the Sigginses are
in fact tyrannical. He is agreeing with
the Union's accusations.

I would not object to this article if
there were one or two lines that seemed
biased. The whole tone of the article,
however, resembles a union tract. At
one point, Carney concludes, "It is
tempting, so easy to conclude, like Sig-
gins, that the kinks . . . will work
themselves out over time." We soon
learn that this is not the case. Poor, evil
Siggins has done it again. Or has he?
David Kramer
BR '87

The writers respond:
We feel that, by knowing only one of the co-
writers' backgrounds, Kramer made a broad
assumption about the tone of the article.
Turner's stance during the strike was much
like Kramer's. The examples you highlight to
illustrate Carney's bias were written and
agreed upon by both writers, as was the entire
article.
