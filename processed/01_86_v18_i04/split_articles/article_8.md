Nine thirty a.m. Monday morning. Courtroom A, located at the end of a long and dusty 
hallway in the New Haven County Courthouse, slowly fills with people. The vast majority 
are men, mostly Hispanic or black. Many appear to have been here before- they stroll in 
casually, calling out greetings and chatting with their wives and girlfriends. In the comer, a 
white girl of about 17, expensively dressed, sits quietly under the "No Smoking" sign. Her 
mother hovers over her. At exactly 10 a.m., the bailiff appears, loudly proclaiming the en-
trance of the judge, but the rest of his speech is barely intelligible as assorted members of the 
crowd shuffie to their feet. From a doorway behind the bench, Judge Robert E. Reilly 
emerges and declares Arraignment Court in session for the day. He reads his rules. No 
wearing hats. No chewing gum. Absolutely no talking. With a final glare around the room, 
he begins the day's proceedings.
