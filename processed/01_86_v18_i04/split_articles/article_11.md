"Students will always 
complain about two 
things: school food 
and health care." 
At 10:00 p.m. on October 9, Aimet' 
Wolfson, TD '87, twisted hel· ankle 
before the Stiles gate. Rushed to 
Urgent Visit by the Yale police, she 
anived at 10:30. Wolfson grimaced 
and shook her head as she recalled her 
ensuing 11xperience with the University 
Health $el'Vkes (UHS). She spent the 
next two hours in the waiting room in 
extreme 
pain; her requests for 
painkillers and aspirin went ignored. 
She said that, once admitted, she 
received a curs.ory examination from·a 
doctor whose only advice was that she 
return the next day for x·rays. The 
non-physician who then treated her 
failed to wash a dirty bleeding !~Crape . 
The foJJowing morning, the physician 
told her she had sprained her ankle, 
and referred her to Physical Therapy 
to have it taped. There, the therapist 
informed her she would be able to walk 
without crutches in three days. 
Despite her doubts about the 
possibility of walking 
.JOOO 
and 
misgivings about the quality of her 
treatment. Wolfson did not question 
the diagnosis. But her parents, both 
physicians, did. Arriving the next day 
for Parents' Weekend, they realized 
that their daughter's problem was 
considerably more serious than had 
been diagnosed. But the orthopedic 
surgeon contracted by the Health Plan 
had left his office earlier that Friday 
and would not be available for three 
days. Convinced that their daughter 
required 
a 
specialist's care, 
the 
Wolfsons finally took her without 
referral to the 
Yale~New Haven 
Hospital emergency room, where a 
physician diagnoaec.l the problem to be 
torn ligaments and set her ankle in a 
cast. He informed her that. baq she 
twisted the ankle again, . she . Woql(i 
have required an oper~tion.

Wolfwn's expetience typical of UHS,

the Health Services provide shQd({y

the Health Services' flaws go negl~d. 
Ultimately, Wolfson blames the 
\'ery structure of the Health Services 
for her shoddy care. Her physician at 
UHS, she accused, was unwilling W 
give her thorough treatment because it 
woJid be too costly. Her criticism may 
be valid: UHS is modeled upon a 
system designed to reduce medical care 
costs. In l971 Yale abandoned its 
insufficient health care system, the. 
Department of University Health, and 
created the first university-based 
Health Maintenance Organization 
(HMO) to offer comprehensive health

•v ................. johnson developed what 
she th~t was a urinary tract infec-
tion (lJTI), a paiQ[ul inflammation of 
the urethra or bl.ader. She turned first 
to Undergraduate Medicine. But when 
her ailment did not respond to 
treatment, her physician ~ferred ber 
to the UHS urologist, 
who sees 
students at the Health Genter on 
Wednesday afternoons. Told that the 
first available appointment was not for 
another mqnth aad a half. Johnson 
turned to Gy~, 
hoping that a 
referral from that department might 
speed the proc:aa. She got the refenal, 
but still could not circumvent the 
wamng 
list. In great pain and 
unwilling. to live with it for six weeks, 
she, like Wolfson, consulted private 
practitioners outside UHS for care. It 
was a $200 decision. but one which got 
her prompt and effective treatment. 
Students, 
however, 
level 
more 
complaints at particular departments 
of the Health Services than they do at 
its organizational structure. In fact, 
none of. the departments students visit 
most frequently- Athletic Medicine, 
Obstetrics/Gynecology, Mental 
Hygiene, Undergraduate Medicine, 
Urgent Visit- escape criticism. 
Students claim that Athletic 
Medicine fails to practice its stated 
policy: 
returning athletes to 
competition as soon as they can 
participate without risking further 
injury. 
Athletes say 
that the 
department places a higher priority on 
sending them back to the fields than it 
does on their health. One student 
described the staff as "a patch·'ern-up-
and·push-'em-out-there sort of crew." 
Athletes commonly believe that advice 
from Athletic Medicine should be. 
taken with a grain of 11alt. and many 
turn to practitioners outside UHS-
some on the ad\' ice of their coaChes. All 
but one of the athletes who reported 
having bad experiences refused to have 
their stories published. Even after 
being offered anonymity, they de-
clined, saying that the nature of their 
problems would identify them. 
Cynthia Russell was willing to break 
the silence only because she is no 
longer able to compete as a runner. 
She cannot walk for long periods 
without pain, and her right hip 
remains bruised to this da)'. While she 
does not blame her permanent dis-
ability on Athletic Medicine, she does 
accuse 
the department of having 
exacerbated her injury: "Because the 
physician took a shortcut I was stuck 
on crutches for three months," she 
said. Now, Russell runs short distances 
occasionally on her own. "l love to 
run," she explained, smiHng shyly as 
she pointed at the copy of Runner 
Magazine on her trunk. She refused to 
name the physician who had treated 
her because she had never confronted 
him directly herself. 
Russell, now a senior, had not run 
competitively before freshman year. 
Upon arriving at Yale, she joined the 
cross-country team and improved hrr 
distance running dramatically in very 
little time. Her body was unprepared 
for the change, however, and she 
injured her right hip. Though she tried 
stretching and applying heat and ice to 
the sore area, the pain persisted. It 
prevented her from completing her last 
race of the season. The next day she 
went to UHS. 
•Tne doctor who rxamined rne had 
been an athlete himself, so I trusted 
him. • she recalled. He explainw to her 
that her problem was a common one, 
and prescribed Motrin, a disinflam-
matory drug. But the pain in her hip 
intensified, and she 
returned to 
Athletic Medicine. This time, the 
physician offered her cortisone, a hor-
mone injected into the tissue around 
joints to reduce inflammation. The 
doctor assured RusseU that the pain 
would vanish within hours of the shot 
and that she would be able to run after 
a few days. She accepted the injection. 
Pain increa~d drarnaticaJly after the 
.shot. In a few hours, she could not 
walk without timeing, She .called the 
physician, wJ:LO :'gain ~xplained that 
the tenderness would ,soon go_ away. It-
didn't. Russell consulted a private 
orthopedic surgeon when she went 
home for Christmas break. BJaming 
the cortisone for worsening her 
condition, h"e put her on crutches. A 
New Haven orthopedic surgeon 
Russell visited upon returning to Yale 
recommended that she be treated with 
ultrasound. She received the therapy at 
UHS, and her condition improved. 
After spring break, she was able to 
walk without crutches. 
According to Dr. Daniel Larson, the 
director and only full-time physician in 
Athletic Medicine, the pressure to 
return to competition tends to come 
from athletes, not coache11. Larson 
added, however, that ~mphasizing a 
speedy recovery never outweighs his 
chief concern: the athlete's health. "We 
want no probability of further injury," 
said Larson, who competed in track at 
Yale. 
Articulate and humorous, 
Larson demonstrated great command 
over his department's statistics. He 
explained that many athletes ignore 
their own long-term health care by not 
returning for further treatment after 
they begin to feel better. "If you have a 
concern about the long-term 
implications of treatment, ask," he 
advised. But this safeguard somehow 
does not seem sufficient. 
The Women's Center, the Coalition 
for an Educated Choice (CEC), and 
the Student Gynecology Resource 
recently sponsored a survey of under-
graduate 
women 
to gauge their 
opinion of UHS's department of Ob-
stetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN). 
According to Hilary 
Fox, 
co-
coordinator of the CEC, many of the 
women surveyed complained of being 
unable to schedule appointments to 
have urgent problems treated 
expeditiously. "People are upset about 
having to wait more than a month or 
six weeks for things like a urinary tract 
infection or a pelvic exam to get birth 
control. These problems are more 
important than the people at DUH 
thiok," Fox said. 
.In fact,' 
when patients call 
OB/GYN, it is departmental policy to 
automatically schedule them for 
appointments six to eight weeks in the 
fQture. However, according to Nurse 
Coordinator Vicki Wirth, women with 
specific problems can be seen in one 
day's time. If patients, after being 
offered a distant appointment, ·then 
explain that 
they have pressing 
concerns, the receptionist will refer 
them to Wirth, who will evaluate the 
urgency of their need. "What the 
patient needs to know," Wirth said, "is 
that if they have a problem and need to 
come in sooner, they should speak to 
the nurse coordinator. The real 
problem is the person who calls in, 
hears the first available appointment is 
six to eight weeks off, gets angry and 
hangs up without pursuing her 
concern further." 
But the "real problem" is that no-
where is this information offered to 
women. The department's handbook 
does not include it in its section 
concerning appointments at OB/GYN. 
Fox herself had never heard the 
process described and, when informed, 
became indignant. She argued that a 
person should neither have to dig for 
an appointment nor give personal in-
formation to a receptionist untrained 
in providing gynecological care. 
Wirth feels that the existing system 
does not jeopardize women's health, 
and that much of the criticism is 
unfair: "People see a light at the end of 
the tunnel as relates to a specific neea. 
They have one time in mind for an 
appointment and are disappointed 
when they can't get it. So we're 
perceived as not being flexible," she 
said. But Wirth agreed that many 
women do not understand how to get 
an appointment at OB/GYN. "I don't 
think they pursue it," she said. "They 
just get discouraged." Yet under the 
present system, Wirth reports that by 
11:00 a.m. her desk is buried beneath 
records of people who called in 
requesting urgent care. One wonders if 
OB/GYN could survive the onslaught 
if all 
its uninformed 
users were 
abruptly enlightened. 
This communication gap could be 
bridged easily by 
detailed 
explanation of the appointment 
process in the student and OB/GYN 
handbooks or, more effectively, by a 
revision of the existing system. Yet 
what can be the purpose of having the 
receptionist automatically give a 
distant appointment other than to 
discourage women from seeking care 
at OB/GYN? If this is the goal, the 
system seems to be 
successful. 
According to a worker at Planned 
Parenthood, an organization on 
Whitney Avenue which provides 
gynecological services, 
more Yale 
women have gone there for care this 
year than in the last three combined. 
"Many students have 
run into an over-
moralistic attitUde 
when asking for birth 
control. Sometimes 
they've been told that 
abstinence is the best 
method." 
Many undergraduates unable to 
schedule a satisfactory appointment in 
OB/GYN also turn to Undergraduate 
Medicine for gynecological care, as the 
"Guide to Obstetrical and Gynecol-
ogical Care" suggests. But there, 
according to Fox, "Many students have 
run into an overmoralistic attitude 
when 
asking for birth control. 
Sometimes they've been told that 
abstinence is the best method." 
One woman recalled her experience 
with Undergraduate Medicine. When 
she developed a urinary tract infection, 
a condition aggravated by her use of a 
diaphragm, Julia Goldburg was ex-
amined by a Student Medicine nurse 
practicioner who informed her that, in 
her opinion, Goldburg should not be 
having premarital sex. Goldburg said 
that the woman stood away from her
