"It is the task of the critic to keep think-
ing open," R.A. Shoaf says. The Yale 
English professor intends both mean-
ings: a critic must think originally and 
yet avoid didacticism. Criticism, and 
especially something as non-limited as 
literary criticism, should pass through 
as many open doors as possible without 
closing any of them; it should pursue 
questioning without satiation. In his 
latest book, Milton, Poet of Duality, 
Shoaf transforms this easily forgotten 
ideal into an entire critical program. 


The book opens something as seeming· 
ly arcane and closed as Milton's 
Paradise Lost and proceeds to draw out 
not only many central problems of 
Milton scholarship, but also many cen-
tral questions of the nature and role of 
poetic rhetoric in general. His analysis 
draws on many contemporary strands 
of critical theory, and his style has the 
unique capacity to be both provocative 
and convincing. 


The subtitle of Shoafs book, "A 
Study of Semiosis in the Poetry and the 
Prose," is a good indication of the point 
from which Shoaf begins. Semiosis-
that is, signification, or more precisely, 
the process by which signification oc-
curs- is a byword among literary 
critics signalling a post-structuralist 
foray into "the text." To look at any 
narrative from the point of view of 
semiosis is to analyze it in its most 
basic function, to evaluate its ability to 
me4n anything at all. 


Shoafs book frames Milton's poetry 
as an analysis of semiosis in its own 
right, an analysis which highlights and 
dramatizes the various dimensions of 
rhetorical signification. Discussing the 
story of humanity's transgression in 
Eden as rendered by Milton, Shoaf 
makes much of the presence of the ap-
ple as a sign in the otherwise heavenly
landscape of the pre-fallen world. This 
becomes particularly meaningful as the 
"sign" is transfigured into a "sin" when 
Adam and Eve taste it, simultaneously 
incurring both their expulsion into the 
world and the replacement of the apple 
with the Son of God, otherwise known 
as the Word. Transgressing the sign, 
mankind falls into language and a con-
dition in need of redemption. Milton's 
saga of the Fall in this way becomes 
tied to problems of"fallen" rhetoric and 
linguistic signification. And this in 
turn leads back to both Milton's 
primary concern as a poet and Shoafs 
concern as a commentator on litera-
ture. Shoaf demonstrates 
from 
a 
literary perspective how Adam and 
Eve's salvation becomes essentially 
linked with the salvation of rhetoric. In 
the critic's treatment, as in the poet's 
rhetoric, the sign-become-sin is recog-
nized to be the legacy of the Fall. 


One interesting dimension of this 
argument is the way it brings together 
such disparate disciplines as Christian 
theology and literary criticism. Both 
the nature and the structure of this 
analysis seem to presume that the 
perennial problem of Western 
humanism- how to account for and 
deal with the gap between language 
and reality- is identical to a central 
tenet of Christian theology. Shoaf ex-
plores the status of rhetoric and the 
problem of its poetic usage in terms of 
transgression and redemption. In do-
ing this, he virtually aligns certain 
issues of modern literary criticism with 
Christian dogma. One might feel that 
this borders on either scholarly hubris 
or perhaps heresy. And yet the point is 
there in Paradise Lost, as Shoaf is able to 
show convincingly. At the very least, 
and to the credit of Shoafs critical 
powers, this argument makes Milton 
seem to have a knowledge of the 
dangers and capabilities of rhetoric 
three centuries ahead of its time. 


By touching many bases, by ad-
dressing everything from epistemology 
to morality and from narcissism to 
Dante, Shoaf goes beyond the inten-
tions of even 
the 
most modern 
criticism, which tends to qualify itself 
as merely "rhetorical" or "structural" 
analysis. This much will be already 
familiar to those who know Shoaf from 
his Yale English literature courses. 


Neither his professorial manner nor 
the substance of his discussions fit 
neatly within the usual parameters of 
literary study. He speaks with a preci-
sion and intensity too rarely en-
countered in classroom discussions. 


His analogies are wild and insightful, 
colored with everything from 
Elizabethan poetry to techniques of 
film editing or even to speech acquisi-
tion among infants. He is not averse to 
gesturing, sometimes extending his 
arms toward students or staring direct-
ly into the eyes of one in order to make 
a point almost embarrassingly per-
sonal, as if physically to lead those who 
are listening into the compelling syn-
thesis of his vision. 


The power of Shoafs analyses and 
the even tone of their development 
make it seem as if, regardless of the 
particular context of the given argu-
ment, something larger is always at 
stake. Implicit iri his academic vision 
is the belief that there is only one 
multi-dimensional 
realm 
of 
truth and knowledge that scholarship 
portends to address. One might sense a 
danger in this, a tendency to overlook 
specifics in the name of profundity. Yet 
Shoars intense style of literary analysis 
does not simply or irrevocably m ix 
.subjects better left apart and distinct. 
On the contrary, pedagogical humility 
and a refined sense of academic 
responsibility consistently check the 
otherwise exuberant drift of his 
argumentation. His questioning never 
loses control, even as momentum car-
ries it well beyond the traditional stric-
tures of interpretation. 


One principle behind Shoars ap-
proach to literature is his stated 
distaste for method. Method, he feels, 
is an unnecessary intrusion into the 
critical enterprise, 
which 
already 
stands in uneasy external relation to 
that which it concerns. The precol'l-
ceived notions of any "method," guidt. 
lines with which to approach a text, ar-
tificially constrain an interpretation to 
say certain things while disqualifying it 
from saying others. 


Dismissing 
method as a critical concern, Shoaf 
makes no pretense of providing a 
manifesto of literary theory. Yet, in 
turning to the text at hand, he pursues 
its meaning with an energy and an 
allegiance 
he terms "a constant 
reference and reverence for the text." 


In this way, Shoaf contributes to the 
field of literary theory, seemingly 
without trying or intending to at all. 


Shoaf strategically and literally uses 
the text's own words to reconstitute it 
in a critical fashion. Borrowing his 
critical vocabulary from the text at 
hand, he tends to blur the d istinction 
between author and reader, between 
the work and its critic. He believes that 
any text, in order to be complete, must 
be understood by someone in external 
relation to it. A text can only be mean-
ingful 
to 
the extenr that 
it 
is 
understood by its readers. 


Every 
reading is therefore a criticism and an 
integral part of the text itself. Shoaf 
begins by criticizing method and yet 
finally implies that some sort of 
method- if orily that of merely com-
prehending- is 
inevitable, 
even 
necessary. 


Why does Shoaf take on such an en-
trenched literary figure as Milton, the 
patriarchal Goliath of English letters? 
There is an answer, perhaps, in the 
fact that something as intransient and 
accessible as theology firmly grounds 
Milton's poetic rhetoric. The Puritan 
poet, himself somewhat of a peda-
gogue, drew only thin d istinctions be-
tween his art and his faith. He allowed 
his poetry to infect his religion and vice 
versa. Because Milton's dual concern 
with art and belief resembles that of the 
literary critic, whose textual analysis 
inhabits the middle realm precisely 
between text and analysis, Shoaf can 
assume a secular equivalent of M ilton's 
Christian piety, a literary faith prox-
imate to the poet's own. By manipu-
lating these 
hidden 
interrelations, 
Shoaf pulls Milton's theological 
rhetoric into the arena of literary 
criticism, a broader context than that 
of religious poetry. He then proceeds 
with his argument into a more or less 
undefined field of humanistic scholar-
ship. 


Shoaf clearly finds much in Milton's 
narrative that 
goes 
beyond both 
theology and literature. In this realm 
of the critical beyond, the boundaries 
and distinctions between one thing and 
another become provocatively unclear, 
and Shoafs argument strains at the 
limits of his scholarly craft. Shoaf then 
is able to read Paradise Lost and other of 
Milton's related works as a parable of 
signification in which ev~y reader has 
a vital stake. With Milton, Shoaf wants 
the reader to feel not only the full 
.weight of a Puritan's severe assessment. 
of humanity but also the persistent 
faith of a theologian. Furthermore, he 
would have us face the peculiar respon-
. sibility which is the poet in us all. 


The question as to how Shoaf can 
possibly bring all this to bear without 
being heavy-handed and transgressing 
his own stated intention to "keep think-
ing open" leads to the central problem 
this book presents: does one finally 
ascribe the argument of Milton, Poet of 
Duality to Milton or to Shoaf? Its basic 
components are ·a set of theological-
poetic principles, the modern abstrac-
tions into and through which they are 
drawn, and a particularly agile critical 
ability. But is it the Puritan's or the 
critic's conclusions that finally win out? 


Shoafs firm answer is that neither one 
nor the other should or even can be 
considered exclusive. His own argu-
ment has two distinct and initially in-
compatible poles: Milton's theology 
and the secular analysis of a literary 
critic. At times an overpowering 
Christian rhetoric pervades the book, 
though Shoaf explains this infusion of 
religious terminology as strategic: it 
reflects the inevitable consideration
