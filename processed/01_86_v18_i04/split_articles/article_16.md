EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
any reader must make for the "intend-
ed" and "prophetic" Christian essence 
of Milton's poetry. This rhetoric also 
reflects Shoafs interest in the tension 
and pull between a Christian poetics 
and the secular, critical stance through 
which it is approached. 

Shoafs ability to forge a cre.ative 
synthesis between the text and its inter-
pretation, by allowing the two to 
merge, is the central and perhaps con-
troversial innovation of Shoafs work as 
a scholar and critic. In Milton, Poet of 
Dtudity, there remains little or no dif-
ference between the theological and the 
secular, the prophetic and the critical; 
Shoaf allows the two poles mutually to 
influence each other and then finally to 
merge together. Thus, it is difficult 
finally to pin down the source of many 
of the claims of the argument. The 
rhetoric is the poet's but it is in turn 
assumed 
by the critic, 
who 
manipulates it while attempting to do 
as little interpretive violence as possi-
ble to the original text. 

However, this light critical treading 
which preserves the poet's rhetoric is 
not merely a passive repetition of 
Milton's 17th century moralism. On 
the contrary, Shoafs argument is in-
formed by all the critical and 
philosophical insight of the centuries 
which proceed Milton. Milton, Poet of 
Duality is not so much a radical reinter-
pretation of the Western canon as a 
more agile construction of one of its 
details. And this is precisely the value 
of Shoafs work as a critic and scholar, 
taking up our literary heritage not to 
polemicize on the impossibility of 
meaning _or in 
reaction to such 
polemics, but rather to consolidate our 
modern perspective and move on, to a 
new style of analysis if necessary. With 
such precedents as this, it seems that 
criticism is now beginning to under-
take the program which Milton in-
stituted three centuries ago, as Shoaf 
puts it, "seeking not the bizarre for its 
own sake but the mysterious articula-
tions of the unities of the plenitude."
