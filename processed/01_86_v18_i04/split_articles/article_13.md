"I'm the wrong color and I'm too big to 
be a battered woman," Gladys Faulk 
told her lawyer after she was sentenced 
to two and a half years in prison on 
November 22. Faulk, a 5'9", 180 
pound black woman had killed her ex-
boyfriend. On the same day as Faulk's 
sentencing another 
New 
Haven 
woman, also 
black, 
committed a 
similar crime. Again on .Christmas 
day, a woman from Dixwell Avenue 
stabbed her ex-boyfriend. These three 
cases of assault within eight months are 
not purely coincidental. They illus-
trate, rather, that battered women 
often turn to violent solutions as a 
result of their inadequate protection by 
the law. 

By virtue of their actions, none of 
these women fit the classic image of the 
defenseless battered woman who is 
unable to fight back. Moreover, all 
three women were black and lower-
middle class. Faulk's situation was 
therefore not unique. Yet her deviation 
from more traditional stereotypes led 
to confusion at her trial, to a conflict 
between Faulk's status as a victim and 
her violent act. The prosecution and 
the defense created opposing images of 
Faulk, each substantiating their claims 
with different definitions of what it 
means to be a battered woman. 

Of the 10 years Faulk lived in New 
Haven and worked as a nurse at Yale-
New Haven Hospital, three of them 
were plagued by a man named Jackson 
Smith. After a six month romantic 
relationship with Smith in 1982, Faulk 
left him because of what she has 
described as his "irrational jealousy." 
Apparently, Smith would not agree to 
be just friends. For three years he 
persistently broke into her home, 
sexually and physically abused her, 
and harrassed her children. Faulk 
moved three times in the course of 
three years to escape Smith, but to no 
avail. On May 18, 1985, Faulk came 
home to find, once again, that Smith 
had broken in. Upon warning from 
her son that Smith was reaching for a 
knife, Faulk grabbed a kitchen knife 
and tried to call the police. In her at-
tempt to make him leave, a fight en-
sued and Faulk fatally injured Smith. 

Faulk was incarcerated the day of 
the incident. Almost immediately, a 
group of New Haven citizens led by 
Faulk's 
friends 
from 
the 
hospital 
formed the Defense Committee for 
Gladys Faulk. The unusual group met 
about once a month at the Dixwell 
Community House, 
a 
modern 
building which stands out 
m 
neighborhood of older, decaying 
tenement housing. The committee has 
raised $2000 bail in contributions from 
Yale-New Haven employees, enabling 
Faulk to get out of jail 10 days after she 
entered. They also organized a mass 
mailing throughout Connecticut which 
raised $1500 for general expenses. In 
order to provide for a good defense 
attorney as well as a child psychologist, 
they held a benefit for her at St. Paul's 
Episcopal Church which drew about 
100 people and raised S 1000. 

At their final meeting on the 
afternoon of November 
7, Jake 
Weinstein, a leading member of the 
committee, elaborated on the case. 
Weinstein, a man in his early thirties 
wearing hiking boots, a t-shirt, and 
jeans was one of the many personal 
friends of Faulk's who made up about 
half of the committee. The other half 
was composed of concerned citizens. 
As an unconventional young man, a 
middle aged black man with a heavy 
African accent, and a lively older 
woman entered the room, Weinstein 
said, "You know when Gladys was 
incarcerated in May she met a lot of 
women in jail for the same reason she 
was." Although the number of women 
who kill their abusers is unknown, 44 
out of 1000 women suffer abuse in 
domestic situations, according to the 
Connecticut Department of Human 
Resources. Moreover, many women in 
jail for murder have killed either their 
husband or their boyfriend. Weinstein 
was very familiar with battered women 
cases and was especially concerned 
with the related issue of police neglect 
of domestic violence. As he slouched 
over the table and clasped his hands, 
Weinstein noted, "She'd call the police, 
but when they came, if they came, 
usually he'd be gone. Of all the times 
Gladys called them, 
they never 
arrested him. This just escalated the 
violence." 

Weinstein and the other committee 
members' awareness reflects a growing 
national concern with cases of domestic 
violence and police negligence toward 
them. In one recent case, Tracey 
Thurman of Torrington, Connecticut 
won $2.3 million in compensatory 
damages from the city. She had been 
permanently disfigured and partially 
paralyzed by her estranged husband in 
1983, and the Court declared that the 
Torrington police deparment's "failure 
to act" on her reports of h'arassment 
and abuse were responsible. This case 
established a precedent that now holds 
the police liable for their inaction. 

Yet police apathy 
to domestic 
violence, as shown in Thurman's case, 
has still not significantly decreased . 
The 10 reports Faulk filed with the 
New Haven police, for instance, were 
entitled "Domestic" rather than 
"Assault." Police often do not view 
seriously the threat to the individual in 
domestic cases because the person 
knows the offender. Moreover, police 
frequently get hurt in these cases. 
Women 
can 
sometimes obtain 
Temporary Restraining Orders 
against their mates, but they are very 
rarely enforced. 
Occasionally the 
police actually find the offender and 
attempt to bring him to court, but 
usually the assailant fails to appear and 
the police merely issue a rearrest 
warrant. Often the warrant will not be 
pursued. The violator is very rarely 
punished, and without a deterrent 
from either the court or the police 
department, women have relatively 
little protection from repeated abuse. 

Police neglect of recurring 
incidents of violence happens at all 
levels of society and among all races. A 
19i7 case from Dansville, Michigan, 
which inspired the film The Burning Bed, 
awakened the nation to the helpless 
~ituation of abused women. The poor 
white 
woman 
cas,Â«; 
involved, 
Francine Hughes, 
was repeatedly 
abused by her husband. As in Faulk's 
case, .the. police could not act upon her 
calls because they had not witnessed 
an abusive incident. Hughes doused 
her bedroom with gasoline while her 
husband was asleep and set it ablaze. A 
more significant parallel between 
Hughes and Faulk is their shared 
economic status. Statistics hint that 
police do less to prevent domestic 
violence in lower-class neighborhoods 
because of their belief in pervasive 
violence among the poor. 

At the sentencing on November 22 
in a hot, overcrowded courtroom in the 
New Haven Superior Court, Faulk's 
case appeared to correspond to the 
Hughes case, but with several unique 
additions. Even before the sentencing 
began, Faulk revealed two different 
images of herself which both the 
prosecution and the defense would 
play upon. Initially, she looked proud 
and strong as she sat up straight in her 
purple velveteen blazer. While she and 
her supporters waited in the tense 
courtroom, Faulk appeared confident 
as many teary, 
nervous friends 
approached her. 
But when 
time for her case arrived, Faulk 
became jittery and glassy-eyed. The
