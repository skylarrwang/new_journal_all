Resurfacing Issues
General Dynamics,
the owner of
Connecticut's Electric Boat shipyard,
can't seem to leave scandal in its wake.
On December 2, a federal grand jury
charged the company with masking
$7.5 million in cost overruns on a
prototype of the Sergeant York anti-
aircraft gun. General Dynamics (GD),
three present company officials, NASA
Chief and former GD Director James
Beggs, were all charged with commit-
ting fraud.

In response to the allegations, the
Navy announced on December 3 that
it was indefinitely suspending GD for
the second time in six months, thereby
forbidding the nation's third largest
defense contractor from receiving any
new government contracts. But the
next day the Navy extended the
December 6 bidding deadline on four
nuclear-powered attack submarines to
keep GD, a main bidder, in the
running. Two days later, the Air Force
followed suit by extending the bidding
on a new fighter plane, which GD is
also competing to build.

The fraud
allegedly took
place
between 1978 and 1981. During that
time, GD was developing a prototype
of the ill-fated Sergeant York, hoping
to win governmental approval to build
the weapon. GD allegedly hid cost
overruns on the program in two
separate accounts,
one involving
weapons-related research and the other
covering the preparation of bids for
other Defense Department contracts.
GD never got the chance to build the
final version of the anti-aircraft gun; in
1981, the Army chose Ford Aerospace
to develop the gun. In August of last
year,
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger cancelled
the entire
Sergeant York program after
weapon repeatedly failed to pass per-
formance tests.

Sources claim that the Pentagon's
suspension of GD is not intended as
punishment.
Rather, said Chip
Partner, a spokesman for Connecticut
Congressman Sam Gejdenson, the
suspension is allowing the Pentagon to
"take a good, hard look at what the
company has done to improve its ac-
counting procedures." According to
Partner, Pentagon officials plan to visit
several GD divisions,
including
Electric Boat in Groton, to examine
both
those procedures and
implementation of a code of ethics,
which GD was required to institute
after the first company suspension.

If GD is found guilty of the charges,
the Pentagon will be forced to consider
debarment, the prohibition of bidding
on
any government contracts.
Explained
Navy spokesman
Bill
Harlow, "There are various kinds of
debarment. You can do it against
certain persons, you can do it against
companies or divisions of companies
for a certain period of time. There are
a lot of options available."

But just how "available" are these
options? In fact, GD's monopolies on
construction of the Navy's Trident
submarine, the Army's M-1 tank, and
the Air Force's F-16 jet fighter all
impede severe government reprisal. As
the bidding extensions demonstrate,
GD, like other major defense con-
tractors, enjoys an impunity which the
Pentagon inevitably must recognize.
Colonel Robert O'Brien, deputy assis-
tant secretary of defense, pointed out,
"To go
into major
fighter com-
petition and automatically exclude
one of your major fighter manufactur-
ers over something that may be
resolved in a matter of weeks-you're
really cutting off your nose to spite
your face."

The Pentagon's recent actions,
however, may signal new willingness
to police itself and its suppliers.
Indeed, the Pentagon exposed the
alleged fraud despite the involvement
of a
high-ranking Administration
official,
NASA Chief Beggs.
On
December 4, Beggs announced that he
was taking a leave of absence from his
post. And on December 26, the Naval
Sea Systems Command offered
Newport
News Shipbuilding the
opportunity to inspect and repair a
Trident submarine later this year.

Since Newport News is the only other
shipyard in the country with the
potential to build a Trident, the offer
represents at least a small step towards
eliminating GD's monopoly on the
sub. Said O'Brien, "The fact that there
are indictments and the fact that the
government is recouping money indi-
cates to me that something not only has
not gone wrong, something has gone
right."

For General Dynamics, the path
ahead looks anything but promising.
While no trial date has been set
concerning the Sergeant York indict-
ments, a new set of charges against the
company is being prepared in Connec-
ticut. Stemming from damaging tape
recordings made by former Electric
Boat Chairman P. Takis Veliotis, these
indictments of former GD Chairman
David Lewis and others are expected
to be handed down sometime in the
next six months.
