while performing the pelvic exam: 
"She seemed so uncomfortable doing 
it, like she thought she might catch 
kooties from me or something- like 
she might catch my disease." 
Undergraduates believe that unless 
they threaten suicide, they will be 
placed on a weeks-long waiting list for 
therapy at Mental Hygiene. According 
to Dr. Robert Arnstein, directorofMental 
Hygiene for 25 years, this perception 
comes from his department's attempt 
to meet an excessive demand. Those 
seeking therapy are first given an 
"initial evaluation" to determine their 
need. If considered "able to function," 
students are then referred to a waiting 
list. The length of the waiting list 
varies with the time of year. For 
example, students who come in on 
March 1 will beÂ· given brief therapy be-
fore the end of the term, and then, if 
necessary, be invited back t~ continue at 
the beginning of the following school year. 
In addiuon, students believe that, 
once in therapy, they will eventually be 
ejected regardless of whether they have 
made any progress. This complaint is 
also grounded in fact, since a flexible 
limit of 15 50-minute visits is placed on 
those students considered "able to 
function. " Once past this limit, 
students must wait until the following 
year to pursue therapy, provided their 
m ental health does not degenerate. 
Arnstein pointed out that many colleges 
provtde for only three or four visits. 
"Yes, there are times we'd like to do 
more," be admitted, "but there's a 
financial limit." 


Students are likely to believe the worst 
of the Health Services because of a 
commonly held perception that the 
medical staff of UHS simply does not 
care about undergraduates. The health 
center is an enormous and busy place. 
Receptionists at the front desk seem 
more interested in the last four digits of 
social security numbers than in names, 
and the place is swarming with 
strangers. 


Added to students' confusion on 
using the Health Services is the 
frustration of waiting for walk-in care. 
Waiting rooms are comfortable, and 
certainly 
spacious . 
Chairs 
are 
cushioned, there is no Muzak (UHS 
dropped it years ago in response to 
complaints), 
and magazines and 
medical pamphlets litter the tables. But 
an afternoon spent leafing through last 
July's New Yorker and periodically 
glancing at the clock is not well spent 
for students in a hurry to get cured and 
get on with life. 


This phenomenon, often considered 
an integral part of the Yale experience, 
is nevertheless avoidable. UHS staff 
members, from the director on down, 
boast of Undergraduate Medicine's 
excellent record for providing same-
day appointments to students who call 
early in the morning. They do not 
need to turn to walk-in care to get 
speedy treatment. Yet the Health Plan 
handbook nowhere 
mentions 
this 
same-day appointment policy. 


Often, those students who do receive 
an appointment still feel alone and 
anonymous when they find themselves 
being examined by a different person 
each time. By recommending that sub-
scribers to the H ealth Plan regularly 
consult one member of the medical 
staff when they require treatment, 
U H S does try to make care more 
personal. But most undergraduates are 
clearly ignorant of this policy, though 
the handbook mentions it. 


Students, then, are partly to blame 
for their perception that the staff of 
UHS is insensitive. For example, 
undergraduates too busy during the 
day wander over to UHS at night 
expecting treatment. Urgent Visit staff 
become impatient dealing with 
students' sore throats while patients 
with more pressing problems are kept 
waiting. 


Unlike the pediatric 
specialists who- staff Undergraduate 
M edicine, the physicians, nurses, and 
physician's assistants of Urgent Visit 
are not trained specifically in treating 
the student age group. When students 
ask a lot of questions or refer to the 
kind of care they received at home, 
Urgent Visit health care providers may 
take offense. Students who do not 
understand their providers' impatience 
attribute it to indifference. 


Beyond claims of insensitivity, 
students frequently accuse the staff of 
downright incompetence. In some 
cases, students' failure to understand 
the nature of their sickness and 
treatment may be at the root of the 
problem. 


Within the college age 
group, illnesses tend to be viral and 
therefore difficult 
to diagnose. 
"Sometimes people have to be sick for a 
finite period of time before we know 
what's wrong with them," explained 
Dr. Jane Rasmussen, a pediatrician in 
Undergraduate Medicine. "Students at 
this stage tend to expect instant care. 
Many of the problems they have are 
viral- mononucleosis, hepatitis-
which modern medicine doesn't have a 
cure for yet. I keep saying maybe to-
morrow. If I don't bring my magic 
wand in some days I can't cure them. 
It's very frustrating." 


The most striking feature of the 
UHS- undergraduate relationship is 
the awesome lack of communication. 
Students aware of problems with 
UHS-either within a department's 
structure or with individual providers-
do not communicate their concerns 
to 
the 
Health Services, 
while 
UHS in turn does not reach out to 
students to dispel their misperceptions. 


UHS has established three vehicles for 
communication to encourage mem-
bers' input, but does not actively 
inform students of their existence. 
They are listed on the 51st page of the 
student handbook. Consequently, stu-
dents, either out of ignorance or 
apathy, do not make use of them. 


Although 
Health Services 
comment card system has served as a 
model for other organizations since 
UHS started using it in 1973, under-
graduates rarely take advantage of it. 
At the front desk in all main reception 
areas, the Health Plan deposits cards 
that encourage general comments and 
pose specific questions, such as "Does 
the UHS seem to you to be staffed by 
competent people?" and "Can you 
suggest any ways in which the UHS could 
improve 1ts services to patients?" Every 
two weeks the Comment Card Com-
mittee, which includes the director and 
the medical director of UHS, evaluates 
the cards and determines which 
member of the staff should respond to 
each comment, and department chiefs 
consult any member of their staff 
targetted with several complaints. No 
students who were interviewed had 
filed cards. 


Another potentially effective but less 
visible medium for communication 
with UHS is the Patient Health Care 
Coordinator, Geraldine Frei. From 
her tiny office on the first floor of the 
health 
center, 
Frei 
addresses in-
dividuals' needs: she is there to explain 
the system to confused patients, to try 
to resolve complaints and, if possible, 
to speed patient access to the various 
departments. However, she is rarely 
contacted by undergraduates and feels 
they are unaware of her office. Frei 
agreed that it would be a good idea to 
inform the students. "Once we posted 
notices about this office irt the offices of 
the residential college deans. We 
perhaps should get back to doing that 
again," she said. 


The third vehicle for dialogue is the 
Consumer Advisory Committee, 
which includes six undergraduate 
representatives among its 18 members. 
Though the committee's purpose is to 
put forward members' complaints and 
to propose new health programs, it 
seems to have no impact on or for the 
undergraduate community. Last year, 
the undergraduate representatives at-
tempted to sound out their peers' 
opinions of UHS. Their survey 
reached only 30 undergraduates, and 
they abandoned the project. Peter 
Litwin, 
DC '86 and committee 
chairman, explained that the under-
graduate representatives plan to raise 
their profile by putting out table tents 
to describe the committee and by 
holding a meeting to discuss the Health 
Plan. To date, the student body has yet 
to be informed of its representatives' 
names. The six students were listed in 
the winter issue of the Yak Health Plata 
Consumer Newsletter, 
which keeps 
H ealth Plan members updated on 
changes in UHS. It is not sent to 
undergraduates. 


Athletes commonly 
believe that advice 
from Athletic 
M edicine should be 
taken with a grain of 
salt. 


Students and UHS staff both acknowl-
edge the lack of communication and 
agree that it causes problems. Why, 
then, is no one doing anything about 
it? The student handbook is clearly 
inadequate. Most students do not have 
the stamina to forge their way through 
it, and, in any case, it omits important 
information. 


Failing to understand 
how to use UHS leads students to 
q uestion its quality. Hearing 
occasional horror stories about 
misdiagnosis and mistreatment at the 
H ealth Services fuels the perception 
that UHS is inadequate. Savvy upper-
classmen convey this negative attitude 
to arriving freshmen, who are already 
uneasy 
about using the 
Health 
Services for the first time. Vague 
denunciations of the quality of care 
abound ("I know I've heard stories 
... "), and misperceptions multiply. 


And the undergraduate community 
does not forget; that Yal!!'s health 
system is still called by its original 
initials, DUH, 14 years after its name 
was changed, is evidence of the 
tenacity of undergraduates' collective, 
collecting memory. 


Perhaps, then, UHS staff members 
are justifiably fatalistic about 
undergraduate criticism. 
One 
phy sicia n 
smiled ruefully in 
responding to students' common 
concerns. "Students will always 
complain about two things: school food 
and health care," she explained. These 
words imply that improving U H S is 
futile. H owever, the premise behind 
them, that undergraduate complaining 
is inevitable, is not valid. Rather, 
complaining is inevitable only if UHS 
continues to operate in a vacuum, 
isolated at the University's periphery. 


If undergraduates would address their 
complaints to UHS instead of to each 
other, and if UHS would step actively 
into the Yale community, a vital part 
of undergraduates' lives could be fully 
integrated.
