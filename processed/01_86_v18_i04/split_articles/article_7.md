assistance and skilled trammg to the 
impoverished , without really under-
standing the values and culture of the 
needy 
nation. 

Believing 
that 
the 
citizens themselves could best bring 
about reform in underdeveloped lands, 
Drayton formed in 1982 the Ashoka 
Society, a relief organization which 
funds Third W orld public service pro-
jects. The Arlington, Virginia-based 
organization now has 1400 members 
and friends and four chapters nation-
wide, including one in New Haven. 

Relying solely on the private sector, 
the Ashoka Society supports not only 
projects but the individuals who create 
them, hoping to provide Third World 
entrepreneuers with an independence 
otherwise unavailable. 

Concentrating its efforts in India 
and Indonesia, Ashoka gives native 
citizens with sound ideas for public ser-
vice work an annual stipend of $2,500 
to $3,500. The money can be used by 
the recipients for personal expenses or 
as capital for new projects. "It's their 
vision we're supporting," said Ted 
Marmor, a memberofthe New Haven 
chapter and a professor of public 
management and social science at 
Yale. 

Since its inception, Ashoka has funded 
33 Third World fellows and now sup-
ports 27. Because of Drayton's work in 
India as an undergraduate, Ashoka has 
a network of friends in Asia who report 
periodically about projects in need of 
funding. "Environmental Education," 
one of Ashoka's most successful pro-
grams in India, stresses that students 
learn from their environment, not 
from rote memorization. The system 
has been nationalized and now affects 
nearly 18,000 schoolchildren. 

The society gathers the necessary 
funds from individuals and corpora-
tions alike. The New Haven chapter 
has raised $500 from its five members 
and is now in the middle of a fund-
raising effort among its 
friends. 

Nonetheless. the local soc1ety is search-
ing actively for a suuable Third \\"orld 
candidate for a five-year fellO\\ ~hip . 
Drayton and the Ashoka Society 
have earned a 
national 
reputation 
for 
innovation 
and 
1m pact, 
as evinced by a MacArthur Fellowship 
which Drayton 
recently received, 
~ corporated, the company that pro-
duces Coppertone and dominates 
the suntan lotion market. Word had 
reached them of Pawelek's inven-
tion. 

Dr. 
Richard Hurd, 
vice-
president of the company, wanted to 
produce and market Pawelek's mol-
ecule. "You can make people tan in 
Chicago in January," he excitedly told 
the inventor. 

prom1smg him $40,000 annually for 
four years. With this stable income, he 
can now direct all his efforts into the 
organization, which may expand its 
aid into North and South America. 

The society may very well succeed 
wherever it travels, because it is, as 
Marmor put it, "an example of a quiet 
network which gets things done. It's 
mainly something we believe in, a way 
for us to do our share of good." 


**Title: Who Needs Florida?**
**Author: Bronwyn Barkan**

When 
Dr. John Pawelek, 
senior 
research scientist in dermatology at 
Yale, dropped his pants in a lecture to 
medical residents, he had a very good 
reason. Pointing to a small tan spot in 
the midst of an otherwise pale leg, 
Pawelek displayed the accidental side 
effect of a molecule he had synthesized, 
which would allow people to maintain 
a healthy golden tan without the bene-
fit of sunny Bahaman beaches. 

Pawelek had been searching for a 
cure to melanoma, a form of skin 
cancer. "One day I was sitting out in 
my back yard late at ni~rht iust free 
associating ... ," Pawelek explained, 
when he conceived of synthetically 
developing a molecule known as phos-
phodopa as a possible remedy for the 
disease. Four years later, after he had in-
jected laboratory mice with phospho-
dopa, he discovered that the molecule 
had not cured their melanoma, but had 
encouraged their cells to produce more 
pigment. The mice had tanned. 

At a dermatology convention in 
1982 Pawelek was approached by a 
representative of Memphis Plough In:. 

Pawelek decided to investigate with 
the Yale Office of Cooperative Re-
search the possibility of a commercial 
company marketing and producing a 
substance invented 
in 
a 
Yale 
laboratory. After complex patent pro-
cedures, an agreement was reached 
between Memphis Plough Inc. and 
Yale, whereby the patent would be 
shared, and Pawelek would continue to 
be involved with the manufacturing of 
his product. 

Memphis Plough Inc. is currently 
conducting toxicity tests in accordance 
with Federal Food and Drug Admin-
istration regulations. Pawelek does not 
believe they will hnd his product 
poisonous. There were no toxic effects 
oÂ·n the laboratory mice, despite the im-
mense doses of phosphodopa that they 
were administered. If the tests con-
tinue as planned, the product should 
hit drugstore shelves by 1987. 

If the product is succe~ful, its pro-
ceeds are sure to be extensive. "I have 
not the slightest idea of what the 
royalties are," Pawelek said. "I am in-
terested in doing research." In fact, 
Pawelek and the Department of Der-
matology will each receive 30 percent 
of the first $200,000 earned, and 
Pawelek will earn 20 percent of the 
profit after that initial sum. 

Pawelek hopes that his product will 
prevent people from over-exposing 
themselves to the sun and increasing 
their risks of contracting melanoma or 
other varieties of the disease. A word of 
caution is in order for all who believe 
their dreams are about to be fulfilled: 
this product will not allow you to tan 
beyond your natural limit. If you tan 
very little now, you are destined to re-
main pale. Nothing will help you 
become a bronze idol.
