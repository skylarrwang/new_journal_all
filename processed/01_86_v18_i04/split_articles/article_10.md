"If you really believe 
that innocent people 
shouldn't go to jail, 
you have to accept 
that guilty people will 
get off free." 
Some court operators feel that the im-
balance of black and Hispanic clients 
and white officials manifests itself in 
subtle forms of racism. 
Reilly 
vehemently denies that any prejudice 
exists in his courtroom, claiming that 
in law school, while living in a low-

neat and clean, and it floors them. 
That doesn't fit the stereotype." For 
Hill, there is only a matter-of-fact ac-

in here for prostitution, and a black 
girl with the same circumstances. 
They'll put the white girl in a halfway 
house, and send the black girl to Nian-
tic [Correctional Institution)." Calmly, 
she told the story of an investigator 
who once asked a public defender if he 
"didn't ever get tired of representing all 
those coons," and laughed. 
"You 
know," Hill said, "the sickest fucking
