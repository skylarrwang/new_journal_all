**Title: Yale has waited for girls too long**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**
**Page number(s): 3**

Debbie Brewster, a brown-haired Vassar 
freshman, thinks Yale should be coed. 
"Especially since Vassar had to go and 
shoot those poor Yalies down." She would 
like to see the day when she could enroll 
at Yale; and, as a matter of fact, there are 
a lot of people who would like to see that 
day come quickly. 

Two weeks ago, a militant minority of 
the Student Advisory Board printed a wall 
poster suggesting the immediate construc-
tion of a geodesic dome over the Cross 
Campus and inviting 500 girls to camp 
out there a Ia Resurrection City. 

A Coeducation Now Committee, pres-
ently in embryonic form, is planning to 
have students vacate certain entryways of 
the residential colleges. Girls will take their 
places ... for a week or two. 

David Kaetz, one of Yale's resident 
good people, is starting a collection for 
funds to buy doors for all the stalls in the 
bathrooms-this being in his mind the 
only obstacle to immediate and complete 
coeducation. 

One man who sees a few other prob-
lems besides doors to bathroom stalls, but 
is somewhat less convinced of the advan-
tages of girls camping out on the Cross 
Campus, is the deciding force in bringing 
girls to Yale: Debbie Brewster's father. 

Kingman Brewster wants undergraduate 
women in the Yale community. "The social 
and moral value of having two thousand 
college girls of outstanding intellectual and 
personal qualification resident in New 
Haven is apparent. Their absence has, in 
the eyes of the faculty and University 
Council Committee on Yale College, put 
Yale at a serious disadvantage both socially 
and morally. The crash week-end, the de-
grading form of social activity known as 
the Mixer, have been distasteful. They are 
a most unhealthy and unnatural part of 
the four Yale undergraduate years. Such 
an environment is not conducive to the 
development of a considerate, mature and 
normal relationship among the sexes." 

Yes, Brewster does want undergraduate 
women at Yale. The two questions are how 
and when. The whole push for women at 
Yale centers on these; and Brewster, im-
bued with the need to listen to student 
opinion, seriously wants a meaningful-
but needless to say responsible-sign of 
what students want. 

Should Yale just admit women into a 
completely coeducational set-up, or should 
it build a separate female coordinate col-
lege? If the trend of other educational 
institutions is an influencing factor, then 
Yale should aim towards coeducation. The 
historic reasons behind coordinate educa-
tion, with a separate administration, fac-
ulty and board of trustees-which spring 
from the belief that men's education is an 
elitist luxury not in keeping with women's 
needs-are dead, or at least in death 
throes. Coordinate institutions such as 
Harvard and Radcliffe or Brown and Pem-
broke are moving toward coeducation. 

Radcliffe women, for example, are taught 
by Harvard faculty, attend Harvard 
courses and receive Harvard degrees. Rad-
cliffe remains coordinate, however, with 
its own trustees, administration, endow-
ment and admissions policy. 

Stanford has gone all the way. Three 
years ago Stanford experimented with a 
coed dormitory.lt was such a success that 
now over 25% of Stanford students live 
in coed houses. It all began when David 
Harris, now Joan Baez's husband but then 
student body president, decided coed 
living was the only healthy way for people 
to get to know each other. Joseph Katz, a 
professor of psychology at Stanford, be-
lieves that the situation prevents over-
idealization of the opposite sex and leads 
to healthy relationships, ultimately to bet-
ter marriages. Katz also speaks of an "in-
cest effect"-residents of the same house 
treat each other as brothers and sisters, 
with a resulting moratorium on casual 
sex. A slight variation of the don't-seduce-
a-girl-Saturday-night-with-whom-you-
have-to-eat-breakfast-Sunday-morning 
rule. The houses usually focus around a 
theme--<:ommunity development or 
French literature, for example. Girls are 
delighted to talk about things other than 
clothes and dates, and boys are delighted 
to listen. The less attractive girls, who 
would take a two-hour bus ride from Vas-
sar to stand in a comer at a Yale mixer, 
interact daily with boys and can be judged 
as whole people, not just potential sex 
machines. 

Brewster understands this trend toward 
coeducation, and his thinking has moved 
quite a distance since he dreamed of Vassar 
a mile or two away. Hopefully he's ready 
to keep moving. 

He presently favors a "coordinate" edu-
cation developed along coeducational 
lines: he wants two separate administra-
tions but one faculty, and says he's flexible 
about the rest. Brewster feels he could 
attract a "better and more interesting" 
person as president of a coordinate college 
for women than as just another member 
of the Yale administration hierarchy. 

But some people disagree. "The separate 
women's administration at Brown," are-
cent Pembroke graduate noted, "only 
attracts the around-forty unmarried career 
woman who is unsure of her own place in 
a male-oriented society. She passes on this 
sense of insecurity to her students; the 
result is a Jot of uptight women within the 
University. The bad parts of my experience 
at Brown had to do with that which was 
particularly Pembroke." 

But women do have special problems 
and needs, Brewster believes, and a sep-
arate administration might be the best way 
to deal with them. "I feel that it is ridicu-
lous to think of women as just child-
bearing men," he says. 

Brewster sees the coordinate arrange-
ment as a chance to be creative, to try 
new methods of education. This innovative 
urge is part of Brewster's sincere desire to 
offer the best in undergraduate education 
for women at Yale. 

"I can't avoid feeling that the introduc-
tion of 1500 women should be used as an 
occasion for experimentation in Yale Col-
lege." He feels that coed residential 
colleges are possible under his plan for 
coordinate education, and can be consid-
ered separately from the coed-coordinate 
issue. 

But there are those who are not con-
vinced that Brewster's plans are innovative 
at all. R. Inslee Clark, dean of undergradu-
ate admissions, feels coordinate education 
is a backward step: "If we go coordinate, 
that only means that in the next ten or 
twenty years we will want to go coed. 
We should set up an institution that is 
forward looking for the next thirty or forty 
years, and not sometime later regret we 
tied ourselves down." 

The coordinate system at Brown and 
Pembroke has in the past few years experi-
enced such difficulties with the transition 
towards coeducation. The coordinate 
women's institution has undergone a series 
of identity crises, fighting to retain a dis-
tinct status within the University but only 
ending up holding itself back. Two years 
ago, on the occasion of Pembroke's 75th 
anniversary, the Brown Daily Herald 
declared the death of Pembroke as a separ-
ate institution, and little has been said since 
in defense of the coordinate system save 
some vague don't-let-go cries for tradition. 

But the underlying factor in any deci-
sion about girls at Yale, as Brewster well 
knows, is money. Any idea has to be sold 
to rich alumni or a very rich alumnus, and 
this is probably a strong influence in push-
ing Brewster towards coordinate educa-
tion. It is, he reasons, easier to sell the so-
and-so College for Women than to raise 
money for simply absorbing girls into Yale. 

And the chances of attracting more capi-
tal, he continues, will be greater if the 
coodinate trusteeship is not just a bipro-
duct of the Yale Corporation: "two teller 
windows instead of one." 

Yale can, of course, make certain com-
promises to a donor's wishes, but it should 
never be caught accepting money on con-
ditions that violate faculty and student 
opinion. Th1s has been a rule that Brewster 
has adhered to in the past; there is no 
reason why he should not follow it with 
the issue of coeducation vs. coordinate 
education.
