to a great extent on its ability to continue 
to capitalize on voter discontent as it did 
this spring when the voters of New Haven 
expressed an amazing degree of anti-war 
or at least anti-administration sentiment. 

The concern voters expressed over a 
national issue, in fact, stimulated a local 
reform impulse. Reform Democrats 
realize, however, that local political strug-
gles in America rarely ascend to debates 
on foreign policy. A sachem of Tammany 
Hall put it rather succinctly when he 
described the futility of the Democratic 
Party's crusade against imperialism in 
1900: 
The Party spent all its breath on that issue 
in the last campaign. That was all right, but 
you can't get people excited about the 
Phillipines. They're too busy makin' a livin' 
to bother about the niggers in the Pacific. 

The reform leaders of New Haven were 
made painfully aware of the volatility of 
national issues on the night of March 31. 
"At first the McCarthy movement here 
was really motivated almost wholly by 
concern for the war," said Professor Van 
Dorn Ooms, one of the principal orga-
nizers of the peace campaign in New 
Haven. "But after Johnson withdrew a 
good deal of wind left our sails and we bad 
to concentrate more on local issues." 

Nevertheless the war in Vietnam did 
act as a catalyst for local political insur-
gency. The unprecedented coverage of the 
war in the media and the strenuous effort 
made by the McCarthyites to inject the 
peace issue into the primaries caused 
national and local issues to be mixed in 
a way that was quite unique. 

Whatever effect the peace issue and 
McCarthy's candidacy bad on the birth 
of the reform movement, it was clear by 
the end of the summer that the organized 
challenge to the Democratic machine in 
New Haven had taken on an identity and 
a stt"ength of its own. When the Reform 
Democratic Movement began organizing 
within the ranks of the McCarthy cam-
paign it created a good bit of tension. One 
group was committed almost exclusively 
to nominating McCarthy in Chicago and, 
with that end in sight, to obtaining fair 
representation at the State Convention in 
Hartford. A spokesman for this group felt 
that "the young reformers" bad taken 
over the McCarthy operation to work for 
local political causes, a development 
which he felt had hurt the effort to secure 
McCarthy's nomination. Furthermore be 
complained that the young people in the 
RDM "wanted to fight and agitate rather 
than work within the party to reform it." 

This gentleman, who complained that the 
young people called him a "patrician 
reformer" and a "Stevenson re-tread," is 
the spokesman for a middle-aged group, 
many of them veterans of Dick Lee's 
campaigns, who are skeptical about the 
RDM. The Democratic Party for them is 
a monumental verity, somewhat like Red 
China: it must be reformed and captured 
if possible, but God forbid that it be fought 
head on. 

The core of young activists in the ROM 
have different priorities. These "new" 
reformers-some who have flirted with 
the New Left and many more who were 
brought into politics by the hope and the 
tragedy that was called Kennedy-felt that 
McCarthy never really had a chance. 

There is some irony in the fact that the 
Senator seemed less important to them 
than he did to the older group; he was, in 
a way, a means to an end. Although some 
of these people look back nostalgically to 
the snowy hills of New Hampshire, many 
more look forward to open conflict with 
the machine in New Haven. The McCarthy 
campaign gave them a unique opportunity 
to infiltrate the Democratic machine, and 
so throughout the summer they concen-
trated on expanding their local power 
rather than campaigning on the long road 
to Chicago. 

Many of these Reform Democrats feel 
uneasy and, in a sense, embarrassed 
working within the regular organization. 
After all, it makes them the colleagues of 
political untouchables like Barbieri and 
Bailey, Dempsey and Dodd. The reformers 
an!, of course, sensitive to leftist charges 
that they are tainted with the odors of 
machine politics. A spokesman for the 
American Independent Movement (AIM) 
said that electoral cooperation with the 
Reform Democrats might be possible but 
that basically the two groups were ideo-
logically incompatible. "In the first place," 
he said, "most AIM people are in some 
sense socialists. We also have no faith in 
the American political system. The Reform 
Democrats even seem to have faith in the 
Democratic Party of Connecticut. They 
say, 'It's hopeless to work in the system, 
but we'll do it anyway. • " 

Some of the reformers are receptive to 
this criticism. One of their leaders, Lee 
Wallace, said that he too had "no faith in 
the party system as it operates today. We 
will have to break it down, but we can 
start by trying to take over the Democratic 
Party," he continued, echoing the old Non-
Partisan League strategy, "because it is 
the party of power in New Haven just as 
it is in most of the South." 

Those who agree with Wallace have 
supported the New Party even without 
McCarthy as a nominee. This form of 
insurgency is not simply a symbolic gesture 
to prove the reformers' militancy; it is an 
alternative strategy for disrupting the 
machine; and, more importantly it is a 
form of moral protest against the perver-
sion of democracy which took place in 
Chicago and, to a lesser extent, in Hartford. 

The older group who worked exclusively 
on the McCarthy campaign finds this 
strategy objectionable. Like Senator Mc-
Carthy and his Connecticut leader, Rever-
end Joseph Duffey, they will stay in the 
party and work for peace candidates, 
wherever those may be found. 

In spite of the strategic and ideological 
differences which separated the young 
Reform Democrats from the McCarthy 
for President people all of the New Haven 
reformers found a basis for cooperation at 
the Hartford convention in June. In bat-
tling for proportional representation, abo-
lition of the unit rule and sweeping reform 
of state election laws, the young activists 
discovered causes with which to confront 
the machine, and the McCarthy parti ans 
found issues which affected their candi-
date·s chances for nomination. 

In general, the ideological focus of most 
of the reformers has been on making the 
political system, especiaiJy the Democratic 
Party, more responsive to the will of the 
people. Some of the people involved in 
the movement go the full distance toward 
government by plebiscite and favor the 
abolition of conventions and the institution 
of a national primary. But there are not 
many thoroughgoing populists among the 
reformers. Van Ooms, the leader of the 
New Haven delegation at Hartford, said 
that he was "not convinced that a national 
presidential primary is the answer": 
Parties have to weigh things other than pure 
public opinion. A national primary would be
