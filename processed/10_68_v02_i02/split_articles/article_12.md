Letters 
To the editors: 
I am rather disturbed to discover in Mopsy 
Strange Kennedy's article on the Living 
Theatre a number of statements and atti-
tudes erroneously attributed to me. (A 
few of tlie students quoted in the piece 
have told me of a similar problem, but I 
shall mention only my own objections.) 
Since I was never interviewed by Mrs. 
Kennedy for this article, I am curious to 
determine how she came to such conclu-
sions and to try to set the record straight. 
First of all, I never called the Living 
Theatre "dull and tedious." Having been 
an admirer and supporter of this group 
since 1957 and the first to invite them to 
this country, I could hardly be expected 
to hold such a simplistic opinion. I have 
complicated but generally positive feelings 
about most of their productions, though I 
did say in a published statement that their 
fourth offering, Paradise Now, was 
"tedious and without much theatrical 
value, an opinion generally shared by 
those who did not participate in the 
proceedings on the stage." 
Secondly, I find it extremely presump-
tuous of Mrs. Kennedy to state that I am 
"frightened by the radicalization going on 
at the School of Drama," if such it can be 
called. The School bas consistently 
encouraged all forms of radical experi-
mentation, and will, I hope, always 
continue to do so. I am proud to say that 
our student body has managed to learn a 
great deal from the visit of the Living 
Theatre and to absorb its more valuable 
achievements, while rejecting what is 
spurious, without feeling compelled, as 
you somehow suggest, to annihilate all 
other existing forms of theatre. Thirdly, 
I am puzzled by Mrs. Kennedy's statement 
that I "sat in ... shirtsleeved gloom" when 
the Becks were in my office foUowing 
their arrest the previous evening. I don't 
remember my state of dress at the time, 
though Mrs. Kennedy was certainly not 
there to witness it; but rather than making 
me gloomy, the Living Theatre filled me 
with a sense of great exhilaration during 
its two-week stay. I resent Mrs. Kennedy's 
further implication that I was somehow 
forced by Judith and Julian Beck to permit 
them to continue with their performance. 
Everyone who knows the facts in this case 
is aware of how hard I fought to keep 
Paradise Now open for its concluding two 
nights. Nor did I suffer from what Mrs. 
Kennedy characterizes as a "painful 
headache" while the Company was here. 
Indeed, I was notably free from such com-
plaints until I read her article. 
In conclusion, I would like to add that 
while I was not surprised to be castigated 
by the New Haven Register and WNHC 
forhaving brought such unorthodox the-
atre to New Haven, I am astonished to find 
The New Journal describing this visit as 
if the Company had somehow materialized 
here against my will and to my dismay. 
This is obviously absurd. I trust that Tlu 
New Journal in future issues will cease 
resorting to a yellow journalism of the left 
in order to produce jazzy copy against a 
deadline. This article is most unworthy of 
the radical but factual standards set last 
year by your previous editor, Dan Yergin. 

Robert Brustein 

Editors' note: 
As Mr. Brustein knows, while Mrs. 
Kennedy did not personally interview him, 
several of the New Journal editors con-
ducted interviews for this article and spoke 
with him personally. We are well aware 
that Mr. Brustein was instrumental in 
bringing the Living Theatre back to the 
United States; rather than trying to attack 
him, or to suggest that he oppose their 
going on stage, we tried to present some 
of the problems that arose during the 
troupe's stay in New Haven. 

I just thought your article on the Living 
Theatre captured the spirit of our 
company, the action that took place in the 
Drama School and the University, and the 
work we are doing: both the positive and 
negative aspects. 

There is a type of student open to 
change who wasn't here 10 years ago but 
is now. 

Most institutions and people ought to 
change. It is a very good thing if the Drama 
School is changed and shaken by our visit 
or anyone else's. The word pleased is 
inadequate. I really dug The New Journal, 
and I hope the people at the Drama School 
will not only have the guts to verbalize 
the change but will have a chance to do 
something.
