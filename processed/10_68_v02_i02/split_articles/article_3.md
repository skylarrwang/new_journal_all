The financial problems, alas, directly 
influence the speed with which Yale can 
admit women. Brewster expects the $50 
million he wants or the $30 million he'll 
settle for to come from a source that 
would not normally donate to any other 
function of the University. He does not 
want Yale to be subject to a charge of 
"taking away" money from areas such as 
bio-medical research to get women to Yale. 
"I try to avoid thinking of priorities," says 
Brewster. "We ought to be able to do this 
without downgrading the other needs." 

One result of this stance is his avoiding 
setting up priorities which recognize the 
urgency of bringing women to Yale. 
Attempting to evade the question of 
time, Yale overlooks perhaps its biggest 
mistake: Yale has waited too long. Now 
only a radical move will keep it from being 
behind the times. Vassar, Wesleyan, Wil-
liams, even Bennington, can be under-
stood if not dismissed. But Princeton? 
The Princeton Report, a 50-page de-
tailed document delving into every aspect 
of education of women at Princeton, de-
cided in favor of immediate coeducation. 
This report, which Brewster admits is rele-
vant, with a few minor exceptions, for 
Yale, finds that coeducation is less expen-
sive and generally more viable than coordi-
nate education. 

Why wasn't the Princeton Report the 
Yale Report? The intended Vassar merger 
is a weak answer. With Dartmouth the 
only bedfellow left, questions of urgency 
cannot be passed off. Yale is behind, and 
unless it moves it will suffer. 

Part of Yale's institutional pride is its 
insistence on doing things "right." There is 
perhaps nothing wrong with doing things 
right, unless "right" is not a little like the 
arrogance that turned Vassar off. At this 
point, "right" certainly does not mean halt-
ingly, conservatively or with the fear of 
not doing things right. 

Brewster understands student demands 
for coeducation but is a bit skeptical of 
the students' sense of urgency concerning 
their social lives. This skepticism towards 
the students' sense of urgency, towards 
their desire for an improved New Haven 
social scene, ignores the sick and unhealthy 
environment to which a Yale student is 
subjected. To pass off the demands of 
urgency as self-interest alone ignores the 
reality of the conditions that exist and their 
effect on the student body. But the question 
of urgency transcends just the unnatural 
living conditions. 

Yale has systematically ignored the 
n~ed to educate women. "Yale cannot 
serve her underlying purpose or the nation 
by not educating women," says Trumbull 
Master Ronald Dworkin. The horrifying 
Jack of women's educational opportunities 
on a national level only increases the de-
mand on Yale to act. 

"Nice as it would be to move slowly, 
the problem of educating women is too 
urgent," says Dworkin. "I am in favor of 
something of a crash program-admitting 
women immediately." To this end, Dwor-
kin advocates doing with Jess than ideal 
physical needs, if it means that girls could 
come to Yale now, in a coed arrangement. 

That Yale's duty to educate women does 
not seem as compelling or urgent as other 
arguments betrays an Old Blue attitude 
toward women: they are somewhat differ-
ent; you know, not quite as good. This 
attitude also affects the decision to go coed 
or coordinate. 

"Coordinate education suggests a separ-
ation, and presumably you create separate 
things when there is something unique 
about the two things," says Inslee Clark. 
"To my mind there is nothing about living, 
sharing ideas, and learning that is unique 
or better for one group than for the other." 

Clark agrees with Dworkin that it is too 
late to wait and that women must be ad-
mitted to Yale immediately. 

More compelling, but no more impor-
tant than the other reasons, is the fact that 
the quality of Yale students is going to 
suffer due to Brewster's hesitancy. Right 
now the students who turn Yale down to 
go somewhere else are among the students 
Yale most wants. They almost all go to 
coeducational institutions. As the entire 
admissions staff well knows, the bright 
young student is no longer buying the 
men's school idea. They only have to read 
the paper to know that if they can't live in 
what they consider a natural environment 
at Yale, there are other fine institutions 
where they can. The Princeton Report 
admits that only about half of a class is 
considered "top rate". The other half are 
not quite as good but are needed to fill the 
class out. There is no doubt this situation 
exists at Yale. Inslee Clark has met pri-
vately with both the faculty and the ad-
ministration and warned them of the 
immediate drop in the quality of students 
at Yale if it does not go coed immediately. 

Brewster is quite aware that the crisis is 
nigh. With the donation in hand, Brewster 
would probably be willing to take some 
bold steps; without it, he is more cautious. 
Yet, a valid argument suggests that if Yale 
plunged into coeducation right now it 
could convince donors of the sincerity of 
its desire to improve women's education. 

"If we admitted women immediately," 
says Ronald Dworkin, "we would get the 
best women in the United States. We would 
get girls of an intellectual quality that 
would make plain our reasons." 

Surprisingly, the Princeton Report con-
cluded that alumni giving would increase 
if coeducation were adopted. First, the 
younger alumni are generally in favor of 
coeducation and are beginning to enter 
income brackets where they could make 
sizeable donations. Second, increasing 
the undergraduate body by 25 or 40 per 
cent necessarily increases the number of 
future donors. Finally, any major issue 
on campus tends to focus almuni attention 
and increases their financial support of 
the University. 

But these arguments, which can be ban-
tered back and forth, pale next to the 
question of attitude. To rush forward does 
not necessarily mean to be haphazard. 
Yale must rush if it is not going. to fall 
seriously behind. This move should be ap-
proached not with a fear of rushing but 
with the optimism of making Yale a for-
ward-looking educational institution. To 
hesitate rather than make a wrong move is 
the old mixer attitude: the boy is out to im-
press the girl rather than meet her. 

"You can't build a perfect institution 
for women before they come," says lnslee 
Clark. "You have to let them come and 
then adjust." Yale doesn't need another 
monument or inflexible institution. If 
Brewster is committed to flexibility, rather 
than fear of future problems, he should 
act-and then meet the problems that will 
arise with a confident enthusiasm. 

Now, how could women be admitted to 
Yale next year? Easy. Classroom space and 
faculty-student ratio are the least compli-
cated problems. The scheduling would be 
tighter at first, but there is plenty of unused 
classroom space at Yale. The Princeton 
Report studied the increases in faculty and 
faculty salaries that would be necessary if 
1000 women were admitted to Princeton. 
They assumed that the faculty-student 
ratio would be maintained and that the 
quality of teaching would remain the same. 
They also assumed that women would 
make approximately the same course selec-
tions as men, a variable open to some 
question but valid enough to work with. 

The increase in needed finances is sur-
prisingly small, the Princeton Report 
found. One reason is that in a large lecture 
course, the women students could be 
added without affecting the class or the 
lecturer. The greatest increase in faculty 
would be needed on lower levels--more 
graduate student instructors to lead discus-
sion sections. But these are the lowest paid 
members of the faculty. The total cost of 
increase in faculty that would be needed 
at all levels to add I 000 women, the 
Princeton Report estimates, would be 
$577,932. Not bad compared with $50 
million.

And Yale could absorb women much 
more easily than Princeton. Because Yale 
is more of a university, there are many de-
partments and faculty that do not reach 
nearly as many students as they could. This 
is true of any university that wants to 
"push the forefronts of knowledge"; some 
administrators call it inefficiency, but 
Brewster rightly cringes at the word. In 
any case, admitting girls to a university 
like Yale would be much easier than at a 
college like Williams, Wesleyan, Vassar, 
Bennington or a small university like 
Princeton-and all of them are managing 
to muddle through. 

Residence problems provide the biggest 
ruQ, but they too can be overcome. Even-
tually more residential colleges will have 
to be built, and men like Rev. Coffin, 
Dworkin, Clark, and R. W. B. Lewis hope 
that the colleges will be on a coed basis. 
"I'd like to see Calhoun thirty per cent 
girls," says Master J.,ewis. "I would almost 
say to the administration, 'aw c'mon and 
take five entryways in Calhoun right 
away.'" 

In the existing colleges the community 
bathrooms would probably make it incon-
venient to have each entryway coed, but 
there is no obstacle to having certain 
entryways of the same college for men 
and others for women. If future colleges 
were built with private bathrooms for each 
suite as is done at Harvard, then even this 
problem would be eliminated. 

Since residential colleges cannot be 
built by next September, there must be 
some means of freeing space in the exist-
ing colleges. The easiest way would be to 
make all triple suites into quads. (In the 
present triple there are two bedrooms and 
a livingroom; instead of having just one 
double bedroom put another bed in the 
single bedroom. Voila.) 

There are approximately 400 triples in 
Yale College. Assuming Yale would admit 
the traditional number of men, a rule not 
quite as sacred as some would have it, then 
there would be 400 places open to women 
in September. Off-campus housing could 
be encouraged for the cause, which would 
also add to the number of women 
admitted. 

If Brewster is hesitant about simply 
admitting 400 women to Yale next year, 
he could instead accept the same number 
of transfers from colleges such as Vassar, 
Smith, Connecticut College, Sarah Law-
rence and Wellesley. These women would 
be here for a year-a modified junior year 
abroad-and would then return and get 
their degrees at their own colleges. If Yale 
did this for a year or two, it would learn 
about the various problems encountered in 
providing excellent women's education. 
By 1970 or 1971, after a couple of years of 
educating women on campus, Yale could 
make the step to coeducation with more 
confidence. 

Looking back at the Vassar-Yale report, 
now only a year old, one sees the anachro-
nisms of a coordinate institution-with its 
own faculty, located possibly miles away 
from Yale in its own very separate kitchen 
-as overwhelming. Yale cannot afford to 
step backwards into the future by creating 
a new institution that is dated, rigid and 
behind the times before it is born. Yale 
must become coeducational. And it must 
do it now. Or, at least, by next year.
