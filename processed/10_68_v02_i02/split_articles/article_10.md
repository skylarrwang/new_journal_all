This transfer of identity could have as-
serted itself logically with a Rebecca-like 
osmosis engendered by Elsa's living in the 
house still haunted by the memory of the 
dead star. Or by a gradual encroachment 
of the part she is acting in her' screen 
debut. Or by the dominance of Zarkin's 
wildly egotistic personality. Or, most prob-
ably, by a combination of these elements. 
However, Aldrich is not so much inter-
ested in logic or probability as be is in 
ramming the power of illusion down the 
audience's throat. Accordingly, Novak/ 
Elsa begins assuming the personality of 
Novak/ Lylah long before any rational 
process can assert itself. 

At the very first audition, Elsa mo-
mentarily and inexplicably displays the 
inflections and manerisms of the dead 
Lylah. During a screening of one of 
Lylah's old films, the soundtrack is turned 
off and Elsa's voice drones on, an exact 
duplication of what was beard on screen. 
Grotesque flashbacks of Lylah's life are, 
for no apparent reason, seen from Elsa's 
point of view, despite the fact that she 
could not have been more than a tot when 
the events in question occurred. 

The characters of Elsa and Lylah shuttle 
back and forth wildly, outside of the film 
part Elsa is taking, outside of any possible 
transformation, outside of reason. In op-
position to the confusion imposed on the 
narrative, Aldrich exercises complete con-
trol over the shooting of the film: every 
set-up is carefuUy composed, every cut is 
precisely timed. The film's visual style is 
characterized by large plastic shapes as-
serting themselves in the foreground of the 
frame. This concreteness this control 
manifested in Lylah Clare's style clashes 
with and ultimately overrides the narrative 
which Aldrich has intentionally reduced 
to a shambles. In other words, although 
we do not understand how and why 
Novak/ Elsa switches characters, we are 
forced to accept her as Lylah when she is 
Lylah and as Elsa when she is Elsa. In 
spite of our rational objections, we are 
completely at the mercy of the director 
and his art. 

Thus, although the film may be con-
fusing on a first viewing, on a second it can 
be terrifying in its avowal of the triumph 
of illusion. For example, an under-the-
credits shot of Elsa making a funny face in 
front of an appliance shop as her image is 
honeycombed by closed-circuit TV on a 
dozed display sets is not so amusing the 
second time around. A preceding shot of 
Elsa writhing among Lylah's fan maga-
zines as the dead star's voice speaks off-
screen in harsh German is so chilling that 
it is difficult to comprehend bow the film 
was interpreted as "yummy" camp by so 
many reviewers. Difficult, that is, if we 
were not used to seeing this catch-all label 
applied to nearly every HoUywood film 
the knights of the keyboard fail to under-
stand. 

If at the beginning of Lylah Clare we 
are puzzled by the shifts between illusion 
and reality in Elsa's personality, as the 
film progresses they cease to merely shift 
but rather merge inextricably. By the time 
of the trapeze scene, we are watching a 
film of a film of an imaginary circus in 
which the allegorical death of Lylah and 
the real deaths of both Elsa and Lylah are
