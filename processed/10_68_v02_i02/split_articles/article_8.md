flatter someone this way. Their poems don't lose interest 
for all that. 

A Young American Poet, according to Paul Carroll's 
selection, has in many ways the best of both schools. Your 
composite Young American Poet was born in 1932, or 
later. He or she has a B.A., frequently an M.A. from 
someplace like the Creative Writing Program at Iowa. 
May have published a book-some have published many 
-but, if so, in all likelihood with a small press of exotic 
title (fibor de Nagy, Black Sparrow, Kayak, etc.). Publi-
cation with a commercial press smacks of sell-out, unless, 
like Aram Saroyan, you can get Random House under 
contract to put out a ream of blank paper stamped with 
your copyright when you've stopped trusting words. 

Almost certainly has appeared in magazines, little Qr 
otherwise, most frequently in those edited by friends. (At 
least 15 of the 54 edit little magazines themselves: the 
small-press/ little-magazine world seems to run on friend-
ships.) Lives in San Francisco, on New York's Lower East 
Side or at a State College--sometimes all three. Makes a 
living teaching, criticizing art or picking up fellowships. 
Promulgates a poetics reluctantly but floridly when 
pressed, disavowing all the while any ability or inclination 
to explain why or how one writes poetry: 
I write poetry to tie leashes onto vacuums because it is a city 
ordinance. I write poetry to be the right person to answer the 
wrong question .... I suppose you could say I write poetry 
to find out why I write poetry. 
(Julia Vinograd) 

Young American Poetry is frank, dramatic, experimen-
tal with language if not with form, rigorous in its demands 
on poet and audience. Young American Poets put 
themselves firmly in the center of their poems. Then 
they call in wives and children, friends and poetic masters, 
not as metaphors, emblems or dramatic poses but as 
facts, even as interruptions to the work of poetry: 
36. 
Life is boring when you are Tarzan of the Apes 
e.g. You step out from behind a bush 
and say 
Yes, lam M'sieurTarzan 
37. 
Dick Gallup arrives at this point 
and says 
" Life is too boring" 
38. 
Jacques Louis David is crying in his crib 
he is not bored 
Jane has given him a banana 
Dick reads those lines 
they bore him 
39. 
but I laugh plenty 
(Ted Berrigan, "Tambourine Life") 

Berrigan has the gall to record visits, drop names, make 
lists, tell bad jokes and turn these accidents into an image 
of a crazy, jangling, thin-skinned existence only the Sal-
vation Army would dream of using for music: tambourine 
life. For these poets, random acts become the poem, or 
the poem itself can become an act, a weapon: 
With its cutting edge 
With its submarine of survivors 
With its flagpole that has run down all flags 
With its shape of a grave-digger's shovel 
With its vein of ore 
With its speed of a runner who leaves no tracks 
I jab into your mouth, this poem, this tongue. 
(Jack Marshall, "Forced Entry") 

Forsaking words, Diane Wakoski, who admits to a fetish 
about George Washington and a soul from the Minoan 
age, poses with a pistol pointed at the startled reader. She 
makes her portrait her best poem. Message from Marshall, 
Wakoski, et al.: a Young American Poet does not hesitate 
to hold the reader up, to aim his poems outward and let 
them explode. To replace Koch's satire of the academic 
style, the first gasp for poetic "Fresh Air," Saint Geraud 
addresses himself directly and bitterly to his contempo-
raries: 
There's no time left to write poems. 
If you wiU write rallying cries, yes, do so, .... 
• 
What I mean is: maybe you are the earth's last poets. 
(Saint Geraud, "To American Poets'') 

Maybe. Koch's poem created a character. Saint Geraud 
is a character, a pseudonym from an 18th-century porno-
graphic novel which masks the poet. "Saint Geraud" 
dismisses Bill Knott (his erstwhile self, real-world name) 
as "a virgin and a suicide." He pubhshed Knott's suicide 
letter widely in 1966 to announce a personal apocalypse. 
Other poets prepare to face the general apocalypse he 
predicts. Robert Kelly tries to articulate it, with the help 
of the world's mythologies and poetic strategies out of 
Blake and Ginsberg. Lou Lipsitz, who has a Ph.D. from 
Yale in Political Science, hopes (momentarily) to avoid it: 
We'll stay 
in the mountains, preaching, 
singing, weaving and propagating 
our own kind. 
(Lipsitz, "For WFG Who Was Told 
That He Didn't Publish Enough to 
be promoted to Associate Professor") 

Young American Poetry begins with the poet at the 
center.lt's a fresh start, with no one pretending that poems 
descend from the air or that poets finally want anything 
more than what they can make poetically. The enterprise 
mushrooms; it involves the reader, radicalizing him artisti-
cally. The key ideas are confrontation and participation, 
as: 
1 hold in my hands 
one invaluable, unusually large, circular, 
hydrated, cellular, fish-spined, shell-pasted, 
molecular, wood-fitted, lilac scented, pollenated, 
earth-colored, Katanga-mined, Bantu-smelted, ... 
mobile, eurhythmic, mechanical 
non-plastic, free-spinning, 
winged, elevated, 
piece of myself. 
If you look closely 
you can see it. 
(Morton Marcus, "Look Closely") 

Any poet wants to make the reader do his share of the 
poetic work, or "look closely," but 71 adjectives for a bit 
of the poet's self-the very accumulation has to suggest 
a new way in this generation to approach the task of 
poetry. These young poets see it as part of their responsi-
bility not to let the reader escape his reading untouched. 
A simple strategy: break a 3-word sentence ("This ... 
ruins me") with a 43-line parenthesis describing the first 
word, as Gerald William Barrax (the one black poet in 
the 54) does in "Second Dance Poem." The reader must 
meet the thing itself head on and face the poet's dissolu-
tion when they both break the spell of the parenthesis. The 
distant reader finds himself implicated, committed-
guerrilla poetry (to which supply any available analogy 
to the Living Theatre). 

Whatever the poem does to the reader dramatically, it 
remains on the page. Therefore, the most exciting work 
by Young American Poets tries all imaginable maneuvers 
with that page. Tricks in this bag are magic to experi-
menters. Berrigan's "Tambourine Life" places events in 
time (sequence or simultaneity) by spacing them-making 
the poem's dramatic strategy a visual one. Barrax's "Sec-
ond Dance Poem" entangles the reader with the poet in 
the parentheses of a paradoxical relationship--making 
the poem's visual strategy a dramatic one. Lines spaced 
out in one way or another keep meanings and images ftex-
ible in the best work. Only poets like James Applewhite, 
Marvin Bell, James Tate and a few others, who move in 
traditional patterns of imagery, take little or no advantage 
of the possibilities of visual form. Oddly, Applewhite, Bell 
and Tate all write about the constrictions of traditional 
form. Once the reader has stumbled happily through the 
chaotic layout of "Tambourine Life" or meandered 
dazedly around Vito Hannibal Acconci's "Kay Price and 
Stella Pajunas," a poem of conventional shape will feel 
cribbed and confined. Young American poets have sur-
veyed e. e. cummings' experiments in typography; they 
have followed Olson's advice to mirror breathing in their 
lines and make the best use of the typewriter. Acconci in 
"Kay Price ... " met these challenges an<! more (near the 
end vertical strips 7 or 8 characters wide describe the 
smalles, largest, longest, quickest books in the world) to

the bewilderment and irritation of the reader. Until you 
reach his note on the title: "Kay Price, of Adelaide, South 
Australia, typed, nonstop, for 53 hours, ending on June 
13, 1962. Stella Pajunas, in 1946, typed 216 words per 
minute on an IBM machine." By this time, what better 
material than a praise of the machine itself, on that 
machine? 

At some point, poem-shapes abandon the verbal re-
sources of traditional poetry. In "Re," Acconci encloses 
each line in 0, often depositing further sets of 0 in be-
tween. Here and there a set of 0 will contain words, 
permutations of "here and there" and "I say." "Re" might 
mean "about," "on the subject of;" it has to do in Latin 
with "thing," which becomes "affairs," or maybe "event" 
-a neat succession to describe what happens in the figure-
poem when the poet tries to capture his experience in 
words and the subject becomes action on paper. With a 
poem like "Scrip Ant," the reader ventures on his own. 
The poet or perpetrator, Clark Coolidge, does offer a 
description of what be's about: 
As Stein has most clearly & accurately indicated, Words have 
a universe of qualities other than those of descriptive relation: 
Hardness, Density, Sound-Shape, Vector-Force, & Degrees of 
Transparency/ Opacity. I am attempting to peer through the 
lines into this possible WoodArt Landscape, work within it & 
return with Wordscapes, WordObjects to light and refresh 
the mind so currently overloaded with centuries of medial 
Language-Tape. 

Acconci and Coolidge appropriate techniques from a 
phenomenon very popular in Europe now: concrete 
poetry. Concrete poets make graphic symbols of words 
and windmills of letters. (The Something Else Press has 
an anthology of concrete poetry with handsome and 
enlightening examples. Sometimes they can be coaxed 
into selling it.) One poet in the 54 has contributed work 
of this type, what he calls "pattern poems." Richard 
Kostelanetz's "Tribute to Henry Ford-1, 2, 3" are com-
posed of Ts and A's, the first two in simple highway traffic 
patterns, the third with both letters in a more complicated 
clover-leaf. These should warn aspirants against choosing 
novelty out of weakness; other poets in this collection go 
beyond their depth with forms and styles borrowed from 
more crafty predecessors or created for the occasion, but 
only these "pattern poems" exploit a mode cheaply. 

Strange that the one poet here who has no art with words 
should supply the longest biography, a full page of small 
print detailing all his critical essays and collections of 
others' writings. 

If some young poets move beyond the tradition by 
pushing form--dramatic and visual-to its limits, others 
move beyond by moving in, by penetrating the verbal 
texture of poetry in order to turn it inside out. (A leader 
like Berrigan bas tried all of these paths. He says he works 
through a poetics in each book he finishes.) Key concept 
here: syntax, the interrelation of parts in language-
structures. Beyond syntax of words within the sentence 
lies a syntax of thoughts, phrases or objects in the poem. 
Traditional poetry places its objects in relations either 
predictable or immediately acceptable. Many Young 
American Poets test variations of the surrealist style, 
rejecting common object-, phrase- or thought-syntax, 
sometimes rejecting even the notion of design, as Sotere 
Torregian does most emphatically. Torregian calls himself 
the "spokesman for the Surrealist Movement in America." 
(The Movement's motto: "C'est Ia guerre totale"-more 
guerrila poetry.) Surrealist images rise from the uncon-
scious, according to practitioners. The poet invites; be 
does not organize. He hopes that alogical connections will 
create a new syntax, evocative or suggestive, possibly a 
projection of something hitherto untapped in the reader's 
unconscious experience. Try, for example: 
Many students of Greek think a thorn of the foot an 
Egyptian bird like a heron 
Three tailors of Tooley Street. He was also the chief Moon 
God "wandering the blue rocks" 
live with me 
(Sotere Torregian, "The Age of Gold") 

What bells ring: Androcles and the lion? An old Irish folk-
song? Sir James Frazier, Oisin or Christopher Marlowe? 
Collect all associations, then test against the title. You 
may miss the sound of poetry, but in exchange you gain 
a kaleidoscope of impossible, beautiful visions at first and 
a knowledge of u.tter deprivation as you approach the end: 
You runaway 
Where girls are dubbed with race-horse wreaths 
You return the area is demolished by the robot 
bomb 
Cheese and bread our diet again 
Weare naked 
(Torregian, "Age of Gold") 

Random images in surrealist poetry replace, or some-
times augment, the random events of "reality" in a poem 
like "Tambourine Life." Although surrealism fashionably 
emphasizes the aleatory element, poetry that takes off 
from this style can still convince the reader that a poet 
remains in control, that he is at the center, still the Hero 
of Art. To explain the origin of this control, Tyner White 
makes a game-metaphor for a process many of his con-
temporaries probably experience in some form: 
Most of my poems start as nonsense improvisations, but once 
the material is on the page and the typewriter has given up, I · 
am in the position of a chess player looking over his board-
White to play and win ... from a defeated jangle of rubbish 
one hopes to make a triumph out of the poem. The trouble is 
knowing what Black will do. 

A game played on the ubiquitous Writing Machine pro-
vides the battleground for the struggle from rubbish to 
poem, always against a mysterious adversary who might 
upset the whole board whenever he chooses. 

Directness that amounts to an assault on the reader, 
startling visual techniques, old methods under new control 
are positive and novel qualities of poets in the new anthol-
ogy. The same qualities, however, lead to characteristic

failings. Directness becomes flat-footed, prosy. Experi-
mental form overwhelms or excludes substance. Linguis-
tic tricks proliferate into chaos. From young poets 
tradition expects, even demands, passion, inventiveness 
and nerve and in return forgives imitation of older poets, 
inflation of inadequate images/ ideas, cramping of what 
could be major images/ ideas. Nevertheless, the excite-
ments of novelty more than compensate for the inevitable 
losses of control. 

In poetry with these qualities another problem arises, 
not strictly new, but very much a part of the new style: 
Do these poems end, or do they just stop? (Does it matter?) 
A slice of life has no necessary structure and conclusion, 
unlike an academic homiJy upon an ant. The pattern of a 
concrete poem can close itself, but the open forms derived 
from cummings, Olson al)d Ginsberg just seem to promise 
more of the same. And the unconscious, the image-
reservoir, of a surrealist runs out of new images sooner 
than it provides their proper completion, whatever it 
might be (assuming that the orthodox surrealist leaves the 
products of his unconscious untampered with). To take 
these statements negatively, as deprecations of contem-
porary poetry, is to accept a common critical premise: 
that the nature of art is to order experience. In the past, 
poets who took the chance of open-endedness in a poem 
usually took pains to point their readers in the right 
direction(s), a kind of ordering. Young poets now might 
argue (do argue, on the evidence of their work) that, given 
the universe of experience they confront, exalting order 
as the only true aim of art would be as false as exalting the 
heroic couplet as the only true form. For many Young • 
American Poets, the criterion of completeness is dated, 
irrelevant. Their poems aproach-
become-happenings, 
happily; and the reader must work to complete the experi-
ence of the poem, if he needs to. Ultimately, this adventi-
tiousness becomes a criterion for the new poetry, and 
editors of little magazines, describing their policies, 
categorically reject the "well-made" poem. Academic 
' r 
style has thus traveled 180 degrees on a wheel of fortune. 
The new style, like the old, has its roots in an attitude 
toward the language available to the poet. A canny young-
ster will carve out for himself something like Peter 
Scheldahl's blob-theory of American English: 
I'm unalterably stuck with the terrible American language, 
which is a volatile and often a very messy language .... 
American words are blobs, rather than clusters, of meaning. 
Sticking with the "native speech rhythms" is the only way to 
know what you yourself are talking about, let alone to com-
municate it to someone el~. 

Altogether, it verges on a political program of novel 
courage, this insistence that even the artist confront the 
life around him directly, instead of trying to shape it 
intellectually. 

The Young American Poets as an anthology is dis-
tinguished by diversity, inclusiveness rather than exclu-
siveness. To put this collection together, Paul Carroll read 
magazines by the hundreds, communicated with scores 
of older poets, teachers and editors and finally invited 
poems from 300 poets. Of whom he chose 54. Hard to 
quarrel with his choices, harder to pick the few who will 
stay the course, one day to write as patronizing an Intro-
duction-by-a-Major-Poet-of-the-Previous-Generation as 
the brief essay by James Dickey which begins this book. 
I might say: Watch Acconci, Berrigan and Tony Towle, 
if you like to laugh while doing headstands. Kelly if your 
visions are naturally mythic. Louise GlUck and Dennis 
Schmitz if you choose to know, elegantly, where you are 
in a poem at all times. Ronald J obnson if you appreciate 
a brilliant meadow when a poet puts you in the middle of 
one. And James Welch, particularly for his special subject 
matter: he's a Blackfoot Indian. Under any circumstances 
or conditions, watch. Almost all of the 54 repay a reading, 
even a strenuous one, and almost all promise more and 
better poetry. Their mistakes are instructive, their suc-
cesses delightful. In one fat volume, with entertaining 
full-page photographs and even more entertaining biog-
raphies-cum-manifestos, they make a zany, furry, some-
times furious, addition to the generative principle in 
anthologies. 

About ten years ago, Paul Carroll was the first editor 
to publish Kerouac, Burroughs and other important Beats 
in Big Table. An anthology like this proves that he remains 
more interested in what a poet is trying to do than in 
telling him what he ought to do--a healthy if heretical 
attitude.~
