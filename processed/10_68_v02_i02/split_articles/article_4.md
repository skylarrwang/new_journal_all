Heroes, hawks, and hacks: in which 
New Raven's white knights battle political 
untouchables to change the system and 
wonder if the system just might change them 
by James Green 
"Reformers," reflected George Washington 
Plunkett, that durable sage of Tammany 
Hall, "were only mornin' glories-looked 
lovely in the mornin' and withered up in 
short time, while the regular machines 
went on tlourishin' forever, like fine oaks." 

Few can deny the historical accuracy of 
Plunkett's remark. Reformers from the 
days of the mugwumps to the "club" 
Democrats of Manhattan have tradition-
ally vented their spleen, usually to the 
discomfort if not the dislocation of the reg-
ulars, and then departed from the scene. 

New Haven has never really had a 
genuine reform movement. The Yankees, 
who were pushed to the sidelines and later 
to the suburbs by "the great unwashed," 
did not return to challenge the political 
power of the ethnic groups. Apparently 
the old stock did not suffer from status 
anxiety when it lost control of the political 
parties to the likes of Davey Fitzgerald 
and the Ullman brothers-the WASPs 
still controlled the law firms, school 
boards, banks and everything else that 
really mattered in New Haven. With the 
exception of a brief flurry of reform 
activity connected with the campaigns of 
Adlai Stevenson and Richard Lee in the 
early fifties, the only real challenge to the 
local party organization was launched this 
year when the McCarthy campaign struck 
New Haven with rather surprising force. 

The entire slate of delegates pledged 
to McCarthy was elected in the April 
primary, and in the next week the 
embryonic Reform Democratic Movement 
(RDM) succeeded in placing eight of its 
members on the Democratic Town Com-
mittee. But in spite of these stunning 
victories by the McCarthyites, the G. W. 
Plunkett of New Haven was sanguine. 

"This is a thing that will pass," mused 
Arthur Barbieri. "In the meantime it is 
my job as town chairman to make sure 
that everyone gets a fair shake." There-
formers have other ideas; they fully 
intend to remain active in New Haven 
and within a few years to win control of 
the Democratic Party from the man they 
call King Arthur. 

The reformers have no illusions about 
the enormity of their task; they admit it will 
be difficult to hold the support they woo 
on the war issue in April and to expand 
their voting base among blacks and 
working-class whites. During the summer 
Irv Stolberg, then a reform candidate for 
the State Senate, predicted that the success 
of the RDM would depend to a great 
degree on the outcome of the primary 
challenges to the organization in 
September. 

The insurgents had considerable 
difficulties with their primary campaigns 
this fall. Most of the student canvassers 
were still on vacation, and those who 
spent the summer in New Haven were "on 
an emotional down" after the events in 
Chica~o. Stolberg reluctantly bowed out 
of his somewhat symbolic race against 
State Senate majority leader Ed Marcus, 
and on primary day all three of the RDM 
candidates for State Assembly lost to 
organization incumbents. The Reform 
Democrats will now concentrate on 
Senator Abraham Ribicoff's campaign for 
re-election instead of a fourth-party effort 
and act as a left-of-center interest group 
in New Haven politics until the next 
elections. 

James Green, a third-year graduate student 
in American History, is currently prepar-
ing a dissertation on American radicalism 
in the early twentieth century. 

The September primaries were not an 
unmitigated disaster for the reformers. In 
the 11 Oth Assembly District Rich Norling, 
a uniquely practical student of political 
science in the Yale Graduate School, lost 
to the incumbent by the agonizing margin 
of five votes. This contest between a young 
reformer and a gnarled regular illustrated 
with remarkable clarity the challenges that 
the RDM faces. 

First of all, the hard-fought campaign 
for the 11 Oth showed the reformers that 
they face an old-time machine which is 
still alive and kicking. Norling lost the 
Thirteenth Ward, a working-class area 
with a sizeable Polish enclave, by a margin 
of almost two to one, because the organi-
zation "got their people out." The old 
politics which the reformers scorn was 
perfectly symbolized in the Thirteenth. 
Across the street from the polling place at 
St. Stanislaus School, the proprietor of a 
Polish meat market proudly displayed a 
picture of the incumbent in his window. 
Attached was a large sign in. royal blue 
letters which read: "Vote for your friend, 
Ed Gudelski." 

The large ethnic vote for the machine 
in the Thirteenth Ward did not surprise 
the reformers. What disturbed them most 
was their inability to get out the "friendly" 
vote. On primary day ROM workers noted 
that a "substantial" number of voters who 
had supported the McCarthy slate in 
April simply did not come out to vote for 
the ROM in September. This problem can 
be explained in part by the lack of student 
canvassers and by the apathetic or "dazed" 
attitude of many of the voters who bad 
supported the McCarthy-Reform slate in 
the spring. 

The long-term problem of voter tran-
siency reared its ugly head in the 
September skirmishness. Much of the 
McCarthy support from the April cam-
. paign had scattered over the summer. The 
RDM draws most of its voting support, 
not to mention its leadership, from the 
ranks of the young professionals-"Yale 
people and other transients," as one 
organization politician put it. "The only 
stable base of support we have," com-
plained one ROM committeeman," is a 
group of lovely old ladies who seemed to 
have been weaned on the politics of 
Horace Greeley." In order to keep pace 
with their highly mobile constituency, the 
reformers must spend an inordinate 
amount of time registering new voters, 
circulating nominating petitions, battling 
with the registrar of voters, publicizing 
meetings and canvassing voters. 

However, the rewards of bringing the 
growing professional-academic group into 
local politics can be substantial, as the 
results of the September primary in the 
heavily student Twenty-First Ward indi-
cated: Norling carried it by a margin of 
138 to 11. The recruitment of this new 
professional-academic group has, in effect, 
made the reform movement in New 
Haven, but it has also exacerbated town-
gown tensions, especially in wards like 
the Thirteenth, where the ethnic working 
class and new intellectual class face each 
other head on. William Miller in his book 
The Fifteenth Ward and the Great Society 
wrote of the "sizzling hatred" of Yale on 
the part of most New Haveners, which has 
resulted in part from the fact that "there 
is no longer a shock-absorbing college-
educated non-Yale middle class." The 
McCarthy campaign has taken deep-
rooted conflict between native and tran-
sient into the political arena. 

The endurance of the ROM will depend
