**Yale's Cultural Lag in Poetry**

On a grey afternoon last spring W. H. Auden appeared at 
Pierson College. Hundreds of eager listeners were turned 
away for lack of space, although many readers consider 
Auden's latest poems to be echoes of his early work. 

Around the same time Kenneth Koch read at Branford 
College. His audience included the friend who had in-
vited him, 8 or I 0 other fellows of Branford who had 
dined with him at the Master's House, and a few-a very 
few-undergraduates. But Koch's long poem, "The 
Pleasures of Peace" (Paris Review, Summer, 1968), which 
he read that day at Branford, may just be one of the most 
brilliant works by any American poet in years, and his 
influence on the best younger poets has been enormous. 

Auden, of course, is famous. He has lectured and read at 
Yale many times before; students may read his work in at 
least one course in the English department. Koch is 
merely active and important. He teaches at Columbia. 

In poetry, as in other areas, Yale suffers from cultural 
lag. What has already been institutionalized is received 
with great enthusiasm; what we cannot yet codify we ig-
nore. The curriculum for both undergraduates and 
graduate students, especially in English, supports, without 
quite acknowledging it, the goal of turning out competent 
scholars and critics--nothing so unprofessional as poets 
and novelists. Particularly not poets, who are at best hard 
to pin down between Honors and High Pass. A working 
poet wants and needs to read what other poets are writing 
now. A budding scholar cares to read only what the tra-
dition has already assimilated. Hence we have a course of 
studies which dares to reach as far as Robert Lowell, 
Sylvia Plath and James Dickey. 

Poets to be studied in class fit the "academic" style, an 
excellent mode which has simply dominated taste too 
long. This line starts, for present purposes, with Eliot and 
Pound, who discovered Tradition. It includes learned 
allusion, organic metaphor and elaborate form. (Pound 
revived the sestina, dead since Sidney as far as anyone 
knows; Eliot adopted and modified it for The Four 
Quartets.) The "baleful influence" (Koch's phrase) of Eliot 
and Pound made it obligatory for a self-respecting poet to 
know and use Latin, 17th-century E nglish poetry and 
19th-century French poetry; to try sestinas, sonnets, villa-
nelles and ballades; to consider as subjects small creatures 
and smaller disappointments. From their example grew a 
school someone has called the "cornbelt metaphysicians." 

Proficient in prosody, they can ruminate inexhaustibly on 
the moral and aesthetic implications of, say, an ugly bird 
which risks its life to obtain food. They "sometimes ... 
brave a subject like the Villa d'Este or a lighthouse in 
Rhode Island" (Koch). Like white liberals, they try to 
overwhelm rebellion by appearing to contain it. Gregory 
Corso once charged that "No square poet would ever 
begin a poem with 'Fried Shoes,' "so John Hollander pro-
duced not one but two, and one of them a villanelle. The 
example of Mr. Hollander, who taught at Yale for several 
years, shows what the dedicated academic poet can do 
with material superficially as unpromising as the descent 
of a chunk of plaster from Wright Hall or Saybrook Col-
lege: it yields the ballad, "Near Tragedy Near Yale Sta-
tion." 

While Eliot and Pound packed their neo-neo-classical 
bags in London and New York, Dr. Williams practiced 
medicine and wrote poetry in Paterson, New Jersey. Key 
phrase for his style: "no ideas but in things." In place of 
philosophy modeled on The Four Quartets or pastiche de-
rived from The Waste Land, the eye of the poet stayed on 
the object, often a simple, domestic object. A red wheel-
barrow or a handful of plums, whose thingness turns the 
poem from a meditation into a dramatic event: 

This Is Just to Say 
I have eaten 
the plums 
that were in 
the icebox 
and which 
you were probably 
saving 
for breakfast 
Forgive me 
they were delicious 
so sweet 
and so cold 
(William Carlos Williams, in Tire 
Collected Earlier Poems) 

Neither the wheelbarrow nor the plums give rise to an 
elaborate rhetorical gesture. Watch the wheelbarrow, cov-
ered with rainwater, and taste the plums; beyond that, it's 
up to you. Born in 1833, Williams was a contemporary of 
Eliot. Yet his style did not come into its own as a model 
until after 1950. 

Following Williams, the Black Mountain poets, led by 
Charles Olson, based "projectivism" on things, on direct 
perception, on composition by field, on process rather 
than idea. Olson refused to let the years he spent at Yale 
affect him. He wanted the reader to hear the poet breath-
ing in the verse and the poet to take advantage of the 
typewriter's distinctive qualities. At Black Mountain 
College, an enclave in North Carolina, Olson, Creeley, 
Dorn, Duncan, Levertov and others published magazines 
and books, developing the means and motives of projectiv-
ism from a combination of Williams with more esoteric 
materials, like Mayan hieroglyphics and H asidic mysti-
cism. Later in the fifties traveling New Yorkers studied 
Williams-plus-Orientalism at the feet of Kenneth Rexroth 
in San Francisco, published their Whitmanesque incan-
tations with Ferlinghetti at the City Lights Bookstore and 
began to call themselves the Beat Generation. 

Meanwhile, back at the university, the academic literary 
quarterlies limited themselves to the accepted style of 
verse, eminently publishable, lamentably perishable. 
Commercial publishers made up slim volumes for poets 
prominent in these quarterlies. Anti-academics countered 
with little magazines and private presses. Apparently 
two separate poetic universes coexisted in this country 
where, after all, the public for any poetry is extremely 
limited. But then an anthology turned coexistence into 
war. 

An anthology can define a generation of poets exclu-
sively. In 1954 Donald Hall, Louis Simpson and Robert 
Pack, academic poets who gathered in someone's aca-
demic basement, slyly limited "the new poets of England 
and America" in their anthology to an academic group 
deeply impressed by the teachings of New Criticism: their 
metaphors developed organically, their poems encouraged 
formalistic explication. Leaf through Hall-Simpson and 
the look of the pages tells the story-solid blocks of print, 
neat stanzas with lines of equal length. Donald Hall 
guided the selection of quiet, competent, nostalgic poems 
like his own appreciation of the Sleeping Giant hill in 
Hamden. In 1960 Donald Allen retaliated with an anthol-
ogy of the Other poets, allowing no overlap. He labeled 
schools: The Projectivists (Olson, Duncan, Levertov, 
Creeley, et at.), The San Francisco Renaissance (Brother 
Antoninus, Ferlinghetti, Jack Spicer, Philip Lamantia), 
The Beat Generation (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Corso}, The 
New York G roup (Koch, Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery). 

Belligerence shouted from Allen's title, The New Ameri-
can Poetry (a contrast to the international style of the 
academics); and the pages of broken lines, shifting forms, 
designs and symbols promised to treat experience freshly. 

Just possibly the appearance of Allen's anthology signaled 
the decline into disfavor of the academic style. Only the 
strongest ivory tower could have withstood Kenneth 
Koch's attack on academics "gargling out innocuous (to 
whom?) poems about maple trees and their children" 
(Allen, p. 231). 

Both older generations influenced the 54 poets in Paul 
Carroll's new anthology, The Young American Poets. 
Young American Poets wear what learning they have 
more lightly than did the academics in Hall-Simpson; 
yet many of them think harder than did Allen's " new 
American poets." Because Paul Carroll had a poem of 
his own among the projectivists in the Allen anthology, 
we should expect a certain sympathy in his collection with 
open forms and experimentation. And he reveals this 
sympathy, without letting it become an exclusive prefer-
ence. His chosen young poets don't line up precisely on 
one side or the other in the great War of the Anthologies. 

In fact, unlike its predecessors, The Young American 
Poets does not define a generation. The generation of these 
poets-those who last-will occur 5 to 10 years from now. 
(Assume that a poetic generation is when something poeti-
cally new happens definitively, or something poetica!Jy 
old ends decisively. Current opinion puts the generation 
of the academics in 1947, with the award of the Pulitzer 
Prize to Lowell's Lord Weary's Castle, and the generation 
of the Others in about 1962.) Right now, more young 
poets reveal their teachers than exhibit poetic personalities 
of their own. Any group of writers 22-35 years old must
