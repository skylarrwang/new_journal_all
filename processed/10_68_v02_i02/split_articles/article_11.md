contained. Yet, despite the indecipherable 
complexity of the scene, we still accept it. 
Aldrich presses his point savagely. As 
Elsa lies dying and the cameras incredibly 
continue to roll, director Zarkin screams 
at some confused extras, "Cry, you clowns! 
You're supposed to to cry!" They cry. In 
the next scene, at the premiere of "Lylah 
Clare-Film Star," we hear the audience 
respond obediently to the silent command 
of the now-invisible director. It need no 
longer be spoken, obviated by an intangi-
ble but unquestionable force. The bizarre 
final scene (a TV dog-food commercial 
which goes beserk) sums up the nature of 
this power; it exists autonomously and irra-
tionally in the medium itself. 

The Legend of Lylah Clare is a Piran-
dellian statement of such depth and feroc-
ity that even respectable efforts in the same 
vein such as Godard's Contempt and 
Minoelli's Two Weeks In Another Town 
pale somewhat in comparison. And 8* 
now looks like child's play. Aldrich has 
created the best film on film ever made and 
the most convincing conscious testi-
monial to the power of his art to control 
and refashion reality. "Live Ghost In An 
Enchanted Cemetery!" shouts a magazine 
cover showing Elsa Brinkman standing 
beneath a portrait of Lylah Clare. But no 
spooks and seances are necessary to haunt 
this strange story. It is a projected strip of 
cellulose acetate, 70mm wide, that gives 
concrete form to these phantasms; the 
medium is the medium.
