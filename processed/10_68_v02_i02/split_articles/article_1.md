Peiffer
During most of September the site of the 
old Yale Co-op-a room above Gnomon 
Copy Service-was cluttered with military 
gear. M-1 and automatic rifles, steel hel-
mets, grenades, knives and ammunition 
packs lay piled on a wooden table. On the 
floor nearby, a US Army tripod-mounted 
machine gun pointed vaguely in the direc-
tion of Morse College. 

The weapons were intended for use in 
the Second American Revolution, whose 
early history is chronicled in Jules Peiffer's 
new play, God Bless, the Yale Repertory 
Theatre's current production. 

In a corner of the room, temporarily 
used for rehearsal, stood Peiffer, slouching 
a bit, his broad face slightly in advance of 
the rest of his body. After glancing around 
the room with worried eyes (his eyes, it 
seems, are always worried), he went over 
to Harold Stone, the director, to find out 
how much time we would have before the 
beginning of rehearsal. 

A ring of wispy, light-brown hair keeps 
Peiffer's baldness at bay. He walks with 
small, shuffling steps, as if testing the floor 
for a spot solid enough to support his foot. 
He seems to view chairs, tables and objects 
in general with suspicion and keeps his 
distance. Not surprisingly, this shrewd 
critic of our world does not feel quite at 
home in it. 

Inevitably, he invites comparison with 
his own cartoon creatures. Despite his suc-
cess and his obvious sense of his worth, 
Peiffer bears a strong family resemblance 
to Bernard Mergendeiler, the hero of many 
of his cartoons. Bernard, born into a world 
less sensitive than he, cowers under a con-
tinual rain of social slings and arrows. 
People look through him at Parties. Girl-
friends break up with him after he has 
bared his soul to them. 

Peiffer's success has no doubt relieved 
him of some of the burdens of being a 
Mergendeiler, but he still shares Bernard's 
basic dilemma. Both fight the same battle: 
Bernard and Peiffer in this corner, the rest 
of the world in that. When we went down 
to Hungry Charley's for lunch, Peiffer 
ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and 
something about the way he examined it, 
lifting up a corner and peeking in, was very 
Bernardish, as if the sandwich presented a 
possible threat or challenge. 

Peiffer's cartoons first appeared in the 
Village Voice-on the condition that they 
not pay him anything. They now appear 
in dozens of newspapers and magazines 
here and abroad and are, needless to say, 
very well paid indeed. Crawling Arnold, 
a one-act play, was performed at Spoleto 
Â·n the Festival of Two Worlds in 1961; 
eiffer's animated cartoon, Munro, won 
Academy Award; he has published a 
cessful novel, and his first full-length 
play, Little Murders, ran on Broadway 
(though not for long). God Bless will open 
in London shortly after its New Haven pre-
miere and is scheduled for performance 
in Los Angeles later in the season. 

Peiffer is attracted by forms other than 
cartoon, which he considers somewhat 
limited in scope. He has written columns, 
but not many because he finds them "such 
hard work." He would like to write novels 
but, again, this kind of writing is difficult 
for him. "Two years of sheer agony" is 
his description of the time spent on Harry, 
the Rat with Women, his only published 
novel. Two years of work, he decided, was 
a lot of effort for 181 pages. 

Cartooning and playwriting do come 
easily for him, but he was hesitant about 
writing plays because he believes a play 
must be bad to succeed in New York. 
"I knew if I ever wrote one that was any 
good, it would close right away," he ex-
plained. "That's what happened to Little 
Murders; that's what will probably happen 
to God Bless." 

Peiffer insists that his method of writing 
a play is entirely distinct from that of 
drawing cartoons, but the characters in 
God Bless are obviously Peiffer people, 
related to the men, women and children 
who talk their way through his cartoons. 
Like them, the characters in the play love 
to give advice and to justify their existence 
to themselves and to the world at large. 

Peiffer is obviously quite pleased with 
his play. He has always wanted to write a 
political play and wrote the first draft of 
God Bless last February under the inspira-
tion (if that is the correct word) of the 
politics of the Great Society. His own po-
litical philosophy might be described as 
optimistic cynicism; he believes the coun-
try must go through a period of right-wing 
repression before true social reform can 
be achieved. But he does feel that the 
country will survive and reform will come. 

Newsweek once described Peiffer as "a 
Clark Kent who takes off his clothes and 
is still Clark Kent." He is the total unhero, 
the odd-man-out whose isolation gives him 
understanding. As the man least able to 
leap tall buildings at a single bound-least 
able, in fact, to leap anything in any num-
ber of bounds-Feiffer is more aware than 
the rest of us of the dangers lurking in the 
world and more willing to point them out. 


**Title: Cream**
**Author: Marty Friedman**

Silence is as important to music as blank 
space is to a sketch; to know when not to 
play is as important as to know when to 
play. Last Friday night at the Arena, the 
Cream forgot-or at least ignored-the 
value of being quiet sometimes. 

Eric Clapton used to sing with his guitar 
(buy the album he and John Mayall did 
together). He used to attack the music 
savagely, with contrasts. Like dark and 
light lines in a drawing, he used loud and 
soft, sharp, and sweet notes. Snatches of 
guitar on the three Cream albums show 
that Clapton can still discriminate, but 
his solo in "Spoonful'' Friday night was 
solid sound without breathing, every note 
on beat in an endless diarrhea. And Ginger 
Baker's drum solo in "Toad" suffered the 
same ailment: an endless rolling and shape-
less emission of sound. There was little 
dialogue between the three musicians, just 
three people belting out noise at once, or, 
for variation, in solo. But there were of 
course standing ovations for Ginger after 
"Toad,'' for Eric after "Spoonful" and for 
Jack Bruce after his harmonica solo in 
"Traintime." 

Perhaps it takes too much energy to 
make good music every night, or perhaps 
the Cream don't care what they play-
you'd get bored too, playing "Toad" before 
shrieking kids for two years. Perhaps I 
was expecting too much after their excel-
lent Wheels of Fire album-in the studio, 
not live. With the six dollars I spent to go 
to the concert, I should have bought the 
new Jimi Hendrix album. 


**Title: Lylah**
**Page number(s): 2, 18**

Robert Aldrich's career in film-making has 
been faithfully inconsistent. For example, 
only Aldrich could blast show business in 
general and Hollywood in particular so 
passionately in The Big Knife (1955) and 
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane (1963), 
while cranking out banal and efficient 
mediocrities (Sod om and Gomorrah, Four 
for Texas) with the apparent impervious-
ness of a John Sturges or a Richard 
Brooks. 

In recent years, Aldrich bas seemingly 
settled down into a comfortable com-
mercial groove with The Flight of the 
Phoenix and The Dirty Dozen, films in 
which frequent lapses in taste and artistic 
judgment are concealed by excellent en-
semble acting and shrewd hucksterism. 

Aldrich was clever enough to contract 
15 per cent of Dozen's huge gross, and he 
used these riches to gain control of what 
Orson Welles called "the biggest toy train 
set in the world"-his own studio. 

The Killing of Sister George, first pro-
duct of Aldrich Studios, is now in the 
final stages of editing. Aldrich's press agent 
assures us that not only will Sister George 
set Hollywood on its ear, but that it will 
make The Fox look like Mary Poppins. In 
between Dirty Dozen and Sister George, 
while Aldrich Studios was being formed, 
The Legend of Lylah Clare was filmed to 
complete Aldrich's M-G-M commit-
ments. Lylah, then, is to all outward ap-
pearances a lame-duck production, a 
contract-filler. It is also the most exciting 
new American film I have seen this year. 

I recommend that the film be seen at 
least twice or not at all. Obviously, the lat-
ter course has been overwhelmingly the 
most popular. Lylalt Clare expired quickly 
on the New York circuit after three weeks, 
shunned even by the 42nd Street vultures 
who pick the bones of recent failures. In 
Los Angeles it was an immediate flop at 
Grauman's Chinese. And it seemed oddly 
appropriate that Loew's 47th was razed by 
wrecking balls the day after Lylah closed. 

For Aldrich has reversed field on us again. 
This visual vaudevillean has shifted gears 
from the dependable hucksterism of Dirty 
Dozen to one of the most intentionally 
anti-commercial films ever to come out of 
Hollywood. Aldrich has chosen to launch a 
ruthless attack on the sensibilities of his 
once-sacrosanct audience. 

The original intent of the screenplay 
seems clear and simple. Lewis Zarkin 
(Peter Finch), a movie director, has been 
in "retirement" for 20 years after the mys-
terious death of his Galatea, Lylah Clare 
(Kim Novak). He attempts a comeback by 
using a look-alike, Elsa Brinkman (also 
Novak), to launch the bio-pic Lylah Clare 
-Film Star. The girl gradually assumes 
her screen role in real life, and the events 
of the past reveal themselves by repeating 
themselves.
