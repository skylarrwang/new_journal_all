interviewed on the local media after his 
return from Chicago and has probably 
gained a few votes as a result of his articu-
late description of the outrages which took 
place there. 

The bosses are quick to defend them-
selves against the reformers' charges. "Of 
course the organization has power," said 
one veteran alderman. "But it wouldn't if 
it wasn't responsive. We don't have pat-
ronage any more, and so we can't control 
people. After all," he concluded smugly, 
"this isn't Chicago." 

Have the bosses of New Haven heard 
their last hurrah? Apparently so, accord-
ing to Morris Olmer, who bravely de-
fended his chief: "The people like Arthur 
Barbieri," he argued, "and they think be's 
responsive. If he wasn't they wouldn't elect 
him town chairman. He is a mediator, not 
a boss like John Golden, who ruled before 
him with an iron hand." 

The heart of the professionals' argu-
ment is that they represent a majority of 
the voters. Barbieri's men maintain. that 
the victory of the McCarthy slate in April 
was less than a sweeping mandate. The 
reformers are a minority, a snobbish intel-
lectual one at that, who are "using the 
bossism issue as a guise for their own pow-
er drive" and "attempting to inflict their 
will on the people." It is a classic example 
of what William Lee Miller called "popu-
list conservatism" in his entertaining book 
on the perils of politics in New Haven's 
Fifteenth Ward. 

It is understandably difficult, however, 
for the reformers to accept the benevolent, 
majoritarian intentions that the regulars 
claim when confronted with incidents like 
the one which occurred in the Second 
Ward during the local primaries. St. Mi-
chael's hall resembled a court house in 
Lowndes County on April15. Voters of 
the Second Ward were intimidated, ha-
rassed and literaJly prevented from voting 
in elections for ward committeemen. The 
chief villain of this piece, one Albert 
Annunziata, attempted to use his power as 
a machine tender to disfranchise as many 
potential reform voters as possible. Using 
various delaying tactics which often bor-
dered on the obscene, this gentleman 
managed to prevent at least twenty people 
from voting, a margin large enough to cost 
the Reform candidate for committee-
woman the election. 

Much to the surprise of the reformers, 
the machine did not get away with this 
reckless bit of chicanery. The three organi-
zation men who executed, but probably did 
not instigate, the disfranchisement activi-
ties were convicted of vote fraud and the 
court recommended that Annunziata, who 
is an attorney for the city, be debarred. 

But due to one of those wonderous va-
garies of Connecticut election law the 
judge maintained that the ruling statute did 
not permit him to order a new election or 
to offer any other remedy to the aggrieved 
voters! For those who are of a conspira-
torial frame of mind, the reformers point 
out that attorney Alexander Goldfarb, a 
hired gun for the Democratic Party in 
Connecticut who defended Annunziata 
et al., is also the draftsman of the afore-
mentioned statute. 

There is of course something more to 
the Reform Democrats' ideology than anti-
bossism. They speak of creating "parti-
cipatory democracy" within their party by 
throwing open the decision-making pro-
cess to all who would participate. The 
RDM bas in fact formalized this concept 
in their new constitution, which provides 
for monthly policy meetings open to all. 

There is much of the old New England 
town meeting in all of this, but very little 
of the trust implied in that image. There-
formers fear power in a way that would do 
Lord Acton proud and tend to spin out 
elaborate checks and balances on leader-
ship when they discuss their organizational 
plans for the future. This fear of the cor-
rupting influence of power is very evident 
in the reformers' attack on the present con-
dition of the Democratic Party. Although 
they have presented a very intelligent cri-
tique of the existing political machinery, 
of primary laws, convention procedures, 
ward organizations etc., it seems that at the 
heart of their attack is a very deep distrust 
of those who have power. "Arthur Bar-
bieri" said one of the leaders of the Mc-
Carthy campaign, "is a bad man." 

Critics of the .RDM doubt that there-
formers have the capacity to be responsive 
leaders. "They're not participatory at all," 
State Representative Morris Olmer, an out-
spoken regular, said of the Reform Demo-
cratic Movement. "They won't meet with 
us to discuss the issues. Their attitude 
seems to be, 'We don't knoW what the peo-
ple want, but we will tell them.' Really, 
they're fascistic-minded." This critique of 
the reformers by a professional is ironic-
ally supported by a man of the New Left, 
Yale Professor Peter Rose, who said he 
feared that the reformers were "not really 
committed to changing the decision-
making processes in New Haven. In fact, 
they have not really consulted the people 
before making their moves.'' Rose was also 
distressed that the reformers we,re too con-
cerned with the traditional, liberal, due-
process approach to problems. "Their fixa-
tion with Roberts' Rules of Order doesn't 
encourage involvement," said Rose. "It 
actually precludes participation by the av-
erage ghetto resident." After observing a 
few of the reformers' seemingly inter-
minable organizational meetings, it is easy 
to apply to them the following character-
ization of amateur club politics offered by 
James Q. Wilson: 

Meetings begin late and end very late. 
Everyone may speak and virtually everyone 
does. Roberts' Rules of Order is very much in 
evidence; indeed it is perhaps the only source 
of authority one can detect .... The amateur 
Democrats are extremely sensitive to the 
charge that amateur politics is nothing but 
a debating society. But ... there is an almost 
irresistible urge among the intellectual 
amateurs to get into the discussion in order 
to attack a weak argument, display a fact, 
dissect an inconsistency or make a point. 

Whatever the inherent inadequacies of the 
reformers' approach to participatory de-
mocracy, the fact remains that there are 
several young activists out in the wards of 
New Haven working to bring more people 
into the political system without waiting 
for it to be completely revolutionized. 

Bruce Payne, who was recently elected a 
Democratic ward committeeman on the 
Reform ticket, is a graduate student in po-
litical science who calls himself a resident 
activist. "I can't provide many of the old 
services," he said describing the limits of 
his role, "like getting city jobs for people; 
but the machine can't either. Many people 
are really lonely and distanced from the 
political order, and I simply try to channel 
their estrangement in useful directions." 

Payne said that people in his ward were 
often anxious to talk about their own 
troubles and to suggest remedies for com-
munity problems. And so he has instituted 
open ward meetings which will serve an 
educational as well as a political function. 

The role of a committeeman as Payne 
Abe Ribicoff: "How hard it is to accept the 
truth." 

Bruce Payne: resident activist, therapist, 
agitator and old time war:d heeler. 

Lee Wallace: "We will have to break the 
party system dowr.." 

sees it combines the talents of a therapist, 
an agitator and an old-time ward heeler. 
Talking to old ladies about their rheuma-
tism, the war in Vietnam and the corner 
street-light all seem to be mixed in the same 
bag. This is certainly not radical reform of 
existing structures-although the RDM 
has worked out some new concepts of 
intra-party democracy. It is, however, an 
attempt to make the system, the ancient 
apparatus which has served this city for so 
long, a bit more responsive to the people 
who live in the New Haven of 1968. 

But good intentions, say critics of the 
reform movement, cannot disguise the 
basically elitist posture of the reformers. A 
critic on the left feels that, 

Basically, the reformers in New Haven want 
to talk to their own kind. They disdain the 
bigotry of the lower-class ethnic groups, but 
they dQn't attempt to understand it. Part of 
the problem is that so many of these people 
are academics. The more the reform move-
mentis University based, the less chance it 
has to understand the problems of the 
community. 

The radical critique of the reformers was 
echoed by a machine politician, who also 
zeroed in on elitism: 

The McCarthy workers had an easy time of it 
bringing out the WASP vote, but they really 
bitched when I brought in old folks and people 
who didn't speak English and tried to help 
them out .... [.The reformers) seem to think 
that only the educated should vote. 

James Q. Wilson in his analysis of reform 
~ 
Democrats concluded that class-based 
elitism was the biggest problem of the or-
ganizations he studied: 

The amateurs seek to mobilize intellectual, 
not material discontent; to obtain recognition 
for the cosmopolitan middle class, not for 
the disadvantaged lower class; and to press 
for rationalization on the basis of general 
principles rather than for the distribution 
of tangible benefits on the basis of personal 
mediation. 

The problem of elitism plagues there-
formers for two reasons: first, because their 
approach to politics and community prob-
lems tends to be filtered through the lenses 
of bourgeois America; and second, be-
cause their more or less permanent mi-
nority position forces them to project their 
political views onto the people from what 
seems to be a position of moral and in-
tellectual superiority. As Wilson pointed 
out, this is the eternal dilemma of there-
formers. "The only alternative to elitism 
is the reformation of public opinion," 
which is a vain hope without the ability to 
organize the mass of the electorate andes-
tablish working alliances with those labor 
and minority groups which do have a mass 
base. The ROM in New Haven seems to 
be caught on the horns of this dilemma. Its 
membership is predominantly middle class 
and upper class, and it has no prospect of 
securing an agreement with labor or the 
white ethnic groups who are intensely 
loyal to Lee if not to the machine. 

Prospects for working with black or-
ganizations should be equally clouded. 
Middle-class reform movements have al-
ways had difficulty enlisting the aid of 
blacks, because, as one political scientist 
has written, 

Except for a handful with an intellectual 
orientation or a professional background, 
most potential Negro leaders seem [to the 
amateurs] to be primarily interested either in 
the conventional rewards of the professional 
politician oroin racist slogans and extreme 
positions.

11 I The New Journal I October 20, 1968 
The New H aven reformers are tempted 
to accept this dichotomy when they see 
Barbieri's black henchman Gene McCabe 
working hard to put together a ghetto ma-
chine like Boss Dawson's in Chicago and 
at the same time they see Fred Harris and 
other militants expressing their standard 
view of white liberals with good inten-
tions. A member of AIM offers this pessi-
mistic view: 

The bourgeois blacks may be willing to go 
along with the reform movement, but, basi-
cally, these liberals don't offer the structural 
changes the residents of the ghetto demand. 

And, what is more, the reformers' due-
process, organizational approach prevents 
them from understanding what's really 
happening among black people. 

lrv Stolberg, a reform leader, acknowl-
edges the difficulties his group has had in 
securing black interest and cooperation. 
"On the one hand, black leaders say that 
the McCarthy people didn't contact them 
early enough in the campaign, and on the 
other hand, when he did speak to them 
early in the winter, they didn't want to ally 
with us because we didn't have any power." 

In spite of all the obstacles and dire pre-
dictions, the McCarthy movement made 
some progress toward political coopera-
tion with the black community. Shortly 
after winning the entire block of New 
Raven's delegates to the Hartford Con-
vention the McCarthy leaders gave four 
alternate positions to black people, in-
cluding Bill Jones of the Progressive Dem-
ocrats and Courtland Wilson of the 
NAACP. Later Jones and Mrs. Fred 
Harris accepted two of the positions the 
McCarthyites had been awarded on the 
Democratic State Committee. At the con-
vention in Hartford, Wilson spoke highly 
of the McCarthy delegates' walk-out; he 
said that they would return to New Haven 
as "winners" in the eyes of his community 
and predicted that there was definitely a 
future in an electoral aJiiance between 
Reform Democrats and the Black Coali-
tion. There is of course some question as 
to how many blacks share Wilson's op-
timism. ("After all," said one white radical, 
"Courtland is a Tom." 

The reformers have, however, taken 
legitimate pleasure in the unexpected de-
velopments which occurred at the RDM 
convention in the Conte School on Sep-
tember 7. After an hour of rather boring 
debate on the constitution, about twenty 
black people including Wilson and John 
Barber, who is certainly not a "Tom," 
strode to the front of the auditorium. Just 
before their arrival Bill Jones made a 
speech, which presumably represented 
more than his own opinion, urging that 
"blacks not give up on the political pro-
cess." In spite of the odious nature of the 
Chicago convention, Jones was encour-
aged by the Negro challenges in southern 
states, by the candidacy of Channing 
Phillips, and by the fact that white instead 
of black militants were exposing their 
heads to police billy clubs. 

In a surprise move, an alert reformer 
nominated Courtland Wilson to oppose 
the temporary chairman of the convention, 
lrv Stolberg, for the vice presidency of the 
ROM. Wilson didn't know quite what to 
make of it but after caucusing with the 
black delegation, decided to accept. Stol-
berg then withdrew and brought the house 
down with his timely statement that "the 
success of the movement will depend on a 
true coalition of all groups in New H aven." 

Wilson was elected along with two other 
members of his delegation who won seats 
on the executive committee of the RDM. 

Apparently, a group of articulate black 
leaders has decided to take a chance on 
the white, middle-class reformers. 

The future of this alliance is, of course, 
very uncertain, and the inclusion of the 
black militants, even for the time being, 
probably reduces even further the appeal 
the RDM will have to labor and ethnic 
groups. There is also considerable doubt as 
to whether the reformers will be able to 
ally with AIM (the convention tabled a 
motion to endorse Robert Cook's can-
didacy on the AIM ticket) even though the 
field staffs of both groups will overlap con-
siderably. 

There are other weighty imponderables. 
Can the ROM maintain the momentum it 
established in the April primaries and dur-
ing the conventions? Will the reformers 
suffer a serious loss of prestige as a result 
of their defeat in the September primaries? 
If the war issue recedes, will the reformers 
lose the liberal, non-student support 
they won on it? There are more basic 
queries to be raised. Can the reformers 
really work within the Democratic party 
for anything like meaningful change in the 
political machinery, not to mention the 
social and economic systems, of New 
Haven. Or will the demands of profes-
sional politics eventually force them into 
the familiar mold-a mold in which their 
radical critics already place them? Can the 
reformers really claim to speak for the 
people even with the majority they attained 
in the April primary; or does their race, 
professional status and intellectual pre-
tension prevent them from really under-
standing what the people, specifically poor 
whites and Negroes, really want or, more 
importantly, why? If these questions are 
not on the minds of the reformers at this 
critical stage in the development of their 
movement, they should be. ~
