EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The war between Nigeria and the seces-
sionist Republic of Biafra is now entering 
a phase in which the densely populated 
heartland of Biafra will be generally over-
run. Many observers have described this 
war, with its already staggering toll of 
death by starvation, as a process of "geno-
cide." 

This word should never be bandied 
about lightly; for surely, should it accurate-
ly describe a situation in the world today, 
a morally concerned American public 
would be expected to demand immediate, 
drastic, multi-national efforts to forestall 
such an outcome. It is therefore extremely 
important for us all to examine very care-
fully what is happening in Biafra at this 
time. 

Eight years ago, the new nation of Ni-
geria was widely bailed as the greatest tri-
umph of British colonial policy. But since 
that time, the realities of political life in 
Nigeria have increasingly shifted from the 
glittering images of progressive nation-
hood which seem to fascinate most Ameri-
can and British diplomats arid officials. 

Many months ago, at the outset of the Bia-
fran secession, the image which these offi-
cials accepted was that of a strong, legally 
constituted nation embarking upon a 
"surgical" and humane operation on one 
of its segments, a segment which had been 
led astray by a clique of evil men. This 
police action, it was h~ld, would end in a 
few weeks at the most, since tbere was "qo 
popular support" behind the Biafran se-
cession. 

However, the realities of the Nigerian 
scene can be observed today through the 
eyewitness reports which have filtered out 
through the international news media since 
the war began, particularly those from re-
porters actually in Biafra or at the battle-
fronts. These accounts have clearly de-
scribed the stubborn devotion of the Bia-
fran people to the cause of their inde-
pendence in the face of tre~endous odds 
and suffering, and they have also reported 
the terrible consequences which have fol-
lowed when the Nigerian armies, made 
victorious by the sheer weight of military 
equipment supplied them by Britain and 
Russia, have confronted Biafran popula-
tions in those areas they have overrun. 

And yet as the death toll mounts, Ameri-
can and British officials continue to mini-
mize it or to dismiss it as an "internal 
matter" to be resolved "by the Nigerians 
themselves." Indeed, when the prediction 
that the people of Biafra had no will to 
fight proved totally false, the British in 
particular did not draw from this the logi-
cal conclusion that their doctrines had 
been wrong. Instead, they proceeded to 
rescue their erroneous theories by provid-
ing arms to the Nigerians, a response 
which our government has quite clearly 
supported. 

How has this state of affairs come 
about? Ultimately, basic responsibility for 
the breakdown itself rests squarely upon 
the shoulders of Great Britain, whose co-
lonial designs made it almost certain, from 
the beginning, that the Nigerian experi-
ment would fail. On the one hand, they 
saw to it that almost all of the economic, 
legal and educational progress would occur 
in the southern regions of Nigeria, not in 
the North, and they encouraged the peo-
ple of the overpopulated East (which later 
became Biafra) to travel as skilled work-
ers into the other regions, thus to serve as 
the primary social "glue" which bound the 
country together. But on the other hand, 
when these same people began leading 
nationalist, democratic movements to-
wards an independent "one Nigeria," the 
British created a parliamentary system 
which ensured that political power would 
predominantly reside in the more con-
genial hands of the authoritarian, tradi-
tional northern rulers, who themselves 
insisted prior to independence on either 
dominating the federation or seceding 
from it. 

For these two reasons, the failure of a 
nation was unknowingly but largely pre-
determined. The Federation began in 1960 
under a coalition between parties based in 
the North and the East, but an inexorable 
series of developments followed indepen-
dence: 

In 1962 the first ominous fracturing oc-
curred in the western region, as a result of 
relentless pressures exerted by the coali-
tion parties in power; by 1963 there were 
intense ethnic-group conflicts over census 
returns from various parts of the federa-
tion. In 1964 a breakdown of the coalition 
between the North and the East was fol-
lowed by party realignments and a dis-
orderly, disputed national election; in 1965 
Hausa people were murdered in consider-
able numbers in turbulent Yorubaland, 
lbos living in the North were publicly vili-
fied by prominent Northern leaders, and a 
blatant rigging--endorsed by the federal 
government--of the Western elections 
effectively destroyed public confidence in 
the electoral process. 

The first army coup of 1966, led by na-
tionalist young (mostly Eastern) officers, 
was widely hailed as the beginning of a 
new national order. But leadership of the 
state fell not to these men but to an older 
officer ~ho proved ineffectual. The extent 
of the coup's failure can be assessed from 
the fact that the countercoup which fol-
lowed was an affair of pure tribal wrath 
which did not even pretend to reflect na-
tional consensus. 

One cannot assess the subsequent de-
velopments of the Biafran secession and 
war without understanding three crucial 
facts. 

First, any careful observer of the Ni-
gerian scene with the slightest capacity for 
objectivity is aware of the enormous com-
plexity of the political maneuverings be-
fore the pogroms of 1966 and knows that 
all ethnic groups in Nigeria contributed 
their full share to the failure of unity. To 
be fair, there were elites from all parts of 
the country who were dedicated to true 
national unity, but these elites had to rely 
for support on grassroots which were 
basically tribalistic in outlook. To some 
degree at least, the populations of Eastern 
origin were the most strongly nationalistic, 
precisely because they had emigrated wide-
ly to other regions; but they also were 
irritants in those regions because of their 
commercial strength and their superior 
education, which sometimes led to arro-
gance. In addition, their position as agents 
of social mixture in those regions made 
them highly vulnerable as scapegoats 
when the basis for unity began to dissolve. 
But such facts hardly justify blaming these 
elements for the loss of unity itself; quite 
the contrary, they were its strongest ad-
vocates. When personal accounts of the 
dissolution become available (assuming 


that representatives of both sides survive 
to write them) the devotion of prominent 
Easterners to the ideal of national unity 
will be indubitable. 

Second, an observer must consider the 
outcome of the rise in intertribal hostility 
which derived from political competition 
on the national level. In September of 
1966 tens of thousands of Easterners were 
slaughtered in the North. Countless others 
were dispossessed, mutilated and terror-
ized, and well over a million such persons 
were driven from the North as refugees 
back to the East. It has been argued by 
some that this pogrom alone was enough 
to destroy the unity of N igeria; but when 
the Nigerian military government, which 
itself had ridden to power only a few 
months earlier over the corpses of more 
than t\VO hundred Eastern officers, pro-
ceeded to cap the pogroms with a public 
breach of the conciliatory agreements ne-
gotiated in Aburi, Ghana, the Biafran 
secession seemed to most Easterners to be 
the only realistic way of ensuring their 
security against what co.uld only appear to 
them as a devious, hostile federal power. 

But the third fact to be emphasized is 
much more important to the situation now, 
and it is the least widely understood. This 
is the fact that, from the time of the po-
groms onward, the Nigerian military gov-
ernment adopted the systematic tactic of 
making a single tribal group the scapegoat 
in order to isolate and minimize its op-
position and to generate a Nigerian unity 
where none initially existed. 

Since the leader of the East was an Ibo, 
since the majority of the eastern popula-
tion was Ibo, since most of the leaders of 
the first military coup had been Ibo, since 
no major lbo leaders had died in that 
earlier coup, and since most of the victims 
of the countercoup and of the pogroms had 
been Ibo, the.new Nigerian military gov-
ernment found it convenient to identify 
the lbos as evil conspirators, as scapegoats 
to be "blamed for the failure of the old fed-
eration. In this way, the Nigerians hoped 
to draw the support of other tribal groups 
away from the new Republic of Biafra and 
to forge a new basis of Nigerian unity 
through shared hatred of imagined Ibo 
viUains. 

The federal government bas of course 
consistently denied discriminating against 
any ethnic group in the federation. How-
ever, this denial gains no credibility from 
the "twelve-state" division of the country 
drawn up by that government, ostensibly 
to provide every major ethnic unit with its 
rightful territorial power base. Taking ac-
count of the fact that the Hausa, Yoruba 
and Ibo populations are, very roughly, 
comparable in numbers (the Hausa being 
somewhat more numerous than the Ibo, 
the Yoruba somewhat less), it turns out 
that in Colonel Gowon's twelve-state 
scheme, the Hausa and Yoruba would be 
allocated an effective majority control 
over three states apiece, covering a total 
area of over 150,000 square miles, while 
the Ibo population would be deprived of 
its most valuable lands and given control 
of a single state covering a tiny region of 
only 8,000 miles-much less than its right-
ful homeland. Quite obviously, this scheme 
was designed to impoverish the Ibo peo-
ple for the benefit of other tribal groups 
in the East and Midwest regions. 

Furthermore, the stereotyping and stig-
matizing of lbos has been the major theme 
of Nigerian government propaganda since 
the beginning of the war. Nobody can re-
main long in Nigeria unless be espouses 
(or at least defers to) this dogma. H owever, 
once a person has accepted it, he can then 
reconcile himself to (and in many cases, 
relish) the prospect that millions of Ibos 
may have to die in the interests of "keep-
ing Nigeria one." 

These policies have, in fact, been effec-
tive in molding attitudes throughout Ni-
geria. I spoke a few days ago to a serious, 
mild-mannered and scholarly official, who 
casually informed me about the war: After 
affirming his sympathy for his "Ibo broth-
ers" (an act which has now become some-
thing of a Nigerian national ritual) and 
pointing out that a hundred or so lbo stu-
dents are prominently in attendance at 
Ibadan University, be complained about 
the sympathy of the American public to-
ward Biafra and said it was unfortunate 
that Nigeria could not engage in the kinds 
of propaganda which would answer the 
Biafran claims. He said to me, "If we told 
the Americans the truth, told them the 
facts that the Ibo people have been evil 
and wicked and seek to destroy our coun-
try, they would ask us, 'Why then do you 
want them in your country at all?' " 

So I brought the question back to him 
and asked, "If you do think they are that 
way, why do you want them in your 
country?" "As they are now," he answered, 
"in their homeland in the center of our 
country, they are all like a cancer which 
will destroy us. If we leave them there, 
they will get arms from France and make 
war against us. We will never rest until 
we have completely rooted out this cancer 
from our country." 

The frightening implication of such 
views, which can be elicited by anybody 
from any Nigerian official who drops his 
guard in conversation, seems to be lost on 
our own government personnel. In fact, 
the leaders of our State Department appear 
to have accepted the Nigerian doctrine of 
total lbo culpability, and perhaps this re-
liance upon Nigerian views is what has led 
them to underestimate so grossly the death 
rate of starving Biafrans. Certainly the 
recent statements by our State Department 
parrot the official Nigerian view of this 
situation, and the views of some of our 
senators appear to have adopted the Ni-
gerian argument that all blame for the 
deaths in Biafra must be relegated to the 
Biafran leaders themselves. 

Clearly, however, the death toll by 
starvation is not the only horror in store 
for the people of Biafra. We all are aware 
that the Nigerian armies which have en-
circled the lbo heartlands are heavily 
armed with British and Russian weapons. 
But it can hardly be doubted, in view of 
reports from the front, that they are also 
strongly armed with the conviction of fa-
natics; that as they kiU Biafrans they are 
destroying a human "cancer" which they 
describe by the term "lbo." And these two 
facts, overwhelming military power and 
overwhelming righteous passion, add up, 
in my opinion, to genocide taking place in 
Biafra today. 

It matters very little whether or not this 
result is intended by General Gowoo, or 
whether a few thousand Ibos are at the 
same time being allowed by the Nigerians 
to live in various other parts of the coun-
try as helots of the state. Peace Corps peo-
ple living in Northern Nigeria at the time 
of the pogroms were astonished at the 
readiness with which ordinarily pacific 
local populations accepted the idea of ob-
literating communities of foreign migrants, 
even after years of peace and considerable 
integration. After 15 months of ferocious 
warfare, there is every probability that 
whatever constraints previously existed in


the populace have been long lost among 
the Nigerian armies in the field and that 
exhortations to be moderate, made by Ni-
gerian leaders at a distance, are unlikely to 
prove effective. 

However, yet another frightening de-
velopment is apparent as this war moves 
towards its seemingly inexorable outcome. 
Parts of the English and American press, 
which formerly reported the conflict with 
considerable objectivity and detail, are 
now beginning to present summaries which 
try to make the best of what is happening, 
to shield us all (including, one may pre-
sume, their authors) from the raw horror 
of recent events. We are being told that 
the starvation of millions is merely an 
efficient means of warfare which has time-
honored precedent, that this is, after all, 
the first time that an African country has 
proved itself by winning its own modern 
war, that the death rate in Biafra seems 
Jess alarming if we compare it with how 
many more might die in the future if 
Nigeria were to disintegrate further. 

Perhaps it is emotionally intolerable for 
us to bear the burden of horror and guilt 
which we would otherwise have to face; 
perhaps we must all react in this way. Per-
haps our State Department finds it neces-
sary to minimize, justify and dismiss the 
situation for the same compelling reasons. 
But I believe that other reactions remain 
possible. Although our government has 
made no effective efforts to stop the fight-
ing, it can still try to minimize the final 
slaughter by bringing the case decisively 
before the United Nations as a matter re-
quiring urgent international action. UN 
observers should be sent into Nigeria in 
large numbers, to forestall the genocide 
which is otherwise highly probable. Occa-
sional brief "official missions," guided by 
Nigerian troops, simply cannot suffice for 
this situation. And our country can mount, 
through the UN or through the various 
agencies now active on the scene, a truly 
massive relief program, rather than the 
token efforts we have made to date. 

But none of this can wait "until the war 
is ended." If we wait until that time, there 
may be very few Biafrans left to save. As 
we stand by, we are viewing a horror un-
folding with a toll in human lives that may 
rival that of the gas chambers of Europe. 
The time to act is now, even though we 
might prefer inaction. Surely we as ana-
tion are guided by some moral standards 
above our own immediate national self-
interest. ~
