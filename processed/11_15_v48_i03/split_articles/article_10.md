A library on wheels combats illiteracy

The bright orange paint on the New Haven bookmo­
bile makes it look like a freewheeling bus of the nine­
teen-sixties. But if you walk inside, you will find that 
the carpeted interior resembles a preschool classroom. 
Wooden shelves jut out of three sides of the bus, filled 
with books of all shapes and sizes. Some are books for 
young children, like Angelina’s Big City Ballet and 
A Mare for Young Wolf; others are elementary school 
favorites, like The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. 


Every year, the bookmobile visits over one hundred sites 
around New Haven, and almost every month it makes a 
two-hour stop at the Blake Street Early Learning Center 
in Westville. 


Children from low-income families have limited access 
to books. The bookmobile is trying to tackle this problem 
in a decidedly non-digital way, by bringing the physical 
book back. In New Haven, where thirty-five percent of 
kids live in poverty, the stakes are high: research shows 
that kids from underprivileged households who cannot 
read proficiently by third grade are six times likelier to 
drop out of high school than their peers. The New Haven 
Free Public Library has operated the bookmobile for 
fourteen years under the assumption that wheels could 
be part of the solution. Last year, the original bus was 
retired due to maintenance issues, and the new bus got 
a head-turning orange paint job. The lettering on one 
side now reads, “expanding minds, unleashing potential”
 and “expandiendo mentes, desatando potencial.”
Vehicles like the bookmobile have a long history in the 
United States, dating back to 1905, when a librarian in 
rural Maryland began carting books around in a wagon 
to reach people who lived far from the library. At their 
peak in the mid-twentieth century, roughly two thousand 
bookmobiles trundled down American streets; as of 2011, 
there were just under seven hundred library bookmobiles 
left. Increasingly a relic of a bygone age, New Haven’s 
bookmobile is playing a tiny part in America’s long battle 
for educational equality. 


In the morning, the first class of ten children filed onto 
the bookmobile from the Blake Street center, with two 
teachers in tow. They chattered noisily as their teachers 
ushered them onto the small benches lining the floor. 
“Who’s been to the library before?” asks Natasha Mick­
elson, who runs the bus’s programs for young children. 
She sits upright in a chair near the front of the bus, smil­
ing at the seated children. The teachers are tasked with
