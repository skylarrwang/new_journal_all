What does the university’s DVD collection say about Yale? 
Madeline Kaplan
since i started working at the Film Study Center 
last September, I’ve walked past Pedalphiles hundreds 
of times. It’s shelved right by the entrance to the film 
library, below Pan’s Labyrinth and a few rows above 
Pulp Fiction. The title is written in orange Comic Sans, 
which tends to catch the eye. Last week, after fourteen 
months of intrigue, I checked out the DVD, carried 
it several blocks up Wall Street, and pushed it into 
my disk drive. Here is what happens in Pedalphiles: a 
documentarian follows several S.C.A.B.s (Skids Creating
Apocalyptic Bicycles) in the year 2000. S.C.A.B.s 
are anti-car, pro-bicycle activists who customize bikes 
and attempt to intimidate drivers. They say rebellious 
things while being interviewed and shout rebellious 
things while riding through the streets of Minneapolis. 
This goes on for thirty-eight minutes. Then the film is 
over. (The credits are also in Comic Sans.)
There are more than 22,000 DVDs in the Film Study 
Center collection, which is housed in the basement 
of the Whitney Humanities Center. Most of the students
who come to the library need to make up for a 
missed class screening, and restrict themselves to several
shelves of films reserved for courses. Huge lectures 
tend to have quite a few stragglers. (It will take a while 
to scrape the Disney syllabus out of my long-term mem­
ory.) Professors can check out an unlimited number of 
films, and many keep a constant stash of several dozen 
DVDs on loan for as long as they want, no risk of late 
fees. One woman brings us a stack of ten movies every 
Tuesday, then asks for ten more. But even the regulars 
tend to stick to certain subsets of the collection: old 
Hollywood classics, contemporary TV dramas, influential
Japanese cinema. After months of fetching the 
same films over and over, I began to wonder about the 
thousands of movies that go perpetually unwatched. It 
was an inspired stroke of procrastination: a search for 
the strangest, most obscure film in the archive.
The “Experimental” section seemed a logical place 
to begin. Since database entries are organized alphabetically,
I started with filmmaker Robert Frank’s 
1971 project, About Me: A Musical. It’s a strange little 
movie, if not a shocking one. Originally intended to be 
a piecemeal meditation on the American music scene, 
at some point during production, it morphed into 
Frank’s first-person journey through various musical 
settings—including the inside of a federal penitentiary. 
(The twist: The filmmaker casts himself as a young 
woman.) About Me: A Musical has no Wikipedia page, 
which makes it pretty obscure by modern standards, 
but its depictions of American music are surprisingly 
meaty. Next on my alphabetized list was The Best of 
Bulgarian Animation, which sounded random enough 
to elude the average Film-Study-Center-goer. In one 
short, a hamlet of squat orange villagers wrestles an 
invading army of slithering black snakes. Not as shiny 
as Pixar, but just as delightful.
I set out to find the film least likely to pique anyone’s 
interest. It would have to be something no professor 
would put on a syllabus, something without much 
of a contribution to its cultural moment. Something 
really unappealing. I sat through (most of) The Lake 
House, a bland and confusing sci-fi romance starring 
Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. But even this could 
have an audience (a scholar of the mid-2000s turtleneck
aesthetic, or a Sandra Bullock fan who made a 
wrong turn).
Searching further for obscure projects, it occurred to 
me that the most unknown films would be listed under 
the “Yale” designation—unlikely to appear in any other 
film archive and, hopefully, impossible to track down 
on the internet. After a bit of digging, I discovered 
Coeducation: The Year They Liberated Yale. The half-
hour-long documentary tracks the first year of coedu­
cation at Yale, from Move-In Day of 1969 to the spring 
of 1970. Though it was filmed forty-five years ago, the 
University looks unnervingly similar to the present-day. 
Female first-years and their parents are worried about 
the social climate of campus, sure, but they’re also 
worried about lugging overstuffed suitcases up four 
flights of Vandy stairs. My favorite interview was filmed 
during Parents’ Weekend in the Pierson courtyard. 
The documentarian asks a father how his daughter is 
enjoying her first few months at Yale, perhaps hoping 
for an answer about the pressure of representing her 
gender, or maybe the anxieties of student unrest over 
Vietnam. “Well, I think she is like most freshmen,” he 
answered. “Lonely.” Coeducation is like a communal 
home movie, the places and people instantly familiar. 
The Yale archive is not just a storage space for the 
anxieties of eighteen-year-olds past. It is also a time 
capsule holding a pair of student-made documentaries 
that speak directly to the student activism unfolding 
on campus today. The first, Warrington Hudlin’s Black 
at Yale, concerns the unconventional education of 
Eugene Rivers. Lacking traditional academic credentials,
Rivers moved to New Haven in 1973 and started 
attending philosophy classes, studying more than fifty 
hours a week, though not enrolled as a student. Once 
Yale administrators discovered that he wasn’t enrolled, 
they were forced to decide whether or not to allow 
Rivers to stay, and to confront an age-old institutional 
question: who is Yale for? 
Thirty years later, Monique Walton and Andia 
Winslow decided to make their own account of Black 
life at Yale in 2004, Still Black, At Yale. In one scene, a 
meeting of The Black Student Alliance at Yale discusses 
holding a Day of Action in response to incidents of 
racial profiling in residential college libraries. We tend 
to think that the things most relevant to our moment 
are happening right now, outside, where everyone can 
see. But sometimes they’re sitting in a film archive, one 
shelf over from the best of Bulgarian animation and 
Keanu Reeves in a turtleneck.
