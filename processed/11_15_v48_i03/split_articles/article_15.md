Bea Dozier-Taylor, the New Haven native who 
opened the bookstore and gallery in 1988, has devoted 
the last twenty-seven years of her life to this message. 
“He who controls the images controls the mind,” she 
says, “and too often Black people are sold on false 
images of ourselves. This is a place for Black brilliance 
and Black beauty.” 

At 64, Dozier-Taylor has the easy wisdom of someone who knows what she believes. Some days she wears 
a wrap over her short-cropped hair, other times a baseball cap. She is quick to smile, if somewhat slower to 
laugh. She does not mince words, nor does she allow 
anyone to put them in her mouth. She quotes verses 
from Elizabeth Alexander, Langston Hughes, and the 
a three-storey building on the corner of Day Street 
and Edgewood Avenue bears two side-by-side signs. The 
first reads, “A Walk in Truth: Christian Books”; the other, 
“blackPRINT: a Black-American Heritage Gallery.” 
Hanging in the window to the right of the entrance is 
a large banner with the words “TELL ALL THE CHILDREN OUR STORY—WE’VE COME THIS FAR 
BY FAITH” in red, black, and green, the colors of the 
Pan-African flag. Campaign signs for Mayor Toni Harp 
run along the windowsills, beside black-and-white posters with the slogan “#BlackLoveMatters.” Fixed to the 
front door is a quote from the African American physician and astronaut Mae Jemison: “Never be limited by 
other people’s limited imaginations.”
