As the public’s understanding of sewage and the 
importance of clean water has evolved, the conditions 
of the rivers have improved over time. This change was 
largely catalyzed by the Clean Water Act, which Con­
necticut passed in 1972 and introduced regulations for 
water polluters and water standards. Recalling the pol­
lution in the nineteen-seventies as its worst ever, Mush­
insky notes the drastic improvements all three New 
Haven rivers have made since then, largely due to the 
Clean Water Act. Fish populations, for example, have 
rebounded. Now ospreys and bald eagles nest along the 
Quinnipiac River.      


But as suburbia has encroached on the undeveloped 
areas, Mushinsky says, so too has the amount of imper­
meable surfaces—sidewalks and streets—that create 
runoff to the rivers. And while the rivers are no lon­
ger streams of sewage and trash, parts of the river and 
its tributaries remain practically cut off from human 
access, generating indifference to them. As a result, the 
river’s health suffers, and New Haven residents don’t 
know they are being robbed of their waters.
with the river tend to be those who use it as a source of 
food—they fish in it and crab in it, unaware that their 
dinner has been swimming in sewage. 


In an effort to alleviate pollution in the West River 
and reconnect residents to the river, local organizers 
have created a plan to bolster New Haven’s grey (i.e. 
traditional and man-made) water infrastructure with 
green infrastructure inspired by the Earth’s natural sys­
tem. On the border of Edgewood Park runs Westpark 
Avenue, one block of which is lined with plant beds 
that look like miniature secret gardens, with small clus­
ters of trees and plants framed by stone blocks and little 
rails. These are bioswales: landscaping elements that 
collect rainwater. They are an element of New Haven’s 
recently established green infrastructure, designed to 
mimic the ways that Earth’s water cycle naturally filters 
out pollutants. A few blocks away, rain gardens—wood­
chip-and-gravel lined rectangles filled with shrubs and 
flowers—dot the roads, diverting water from storm 
drains and filtering out pollutants.


The bioswales are part of a larger initiative put 
forth by the West River Watershed Coalition, a group 
of local residents, activists, and government officials 
trying to heal New Haven’s rivers using methods that 
rely on cultural change and green infrastructure. The 
West River Watershed Restoration Plan, which was 
approved this October, outlines the Coalition’s goals—
using green infrastructure projects like bioswales and 
rain gardens to reduce CSOs, preserving and restoring 
habitat along the river, increasing flood resilience, and 
educating the community about the rivers to encour­
age connection and stewardship. 


When Europeans first founded urban settlements 
in the New Haven area, early New Haven residents 
began “using rivers basically as conveyance systems 
for sewage and other types of trash,” Barbery told me. 
Eventually, the river and its tributaries became so con­
taminated that people preferred no waterways at all.


By the middle of the twentieth century, the rivers 
were full of contaminants and impossible to use for 
any recreational purposes. “When I was a kid, the river 
was something to be afraid of,” Wallingford State Rep­
resentative Mary Mushinsky said. “It was very foul—
once in a while there was a boat trip and it would be so 
unpleasant that you wouldn’t want to go again.” 


As a child growing up in Westville, environmental 
anthropologist David Casagrande, FES ’95, remem­
bers going down to play in the river, near where the 
pulp factory where his father worked  discharged its 
waste into the water. Casagrande’s father has child­

Gary Zrelak, director of operations at the East Shore 
Water Pollution Abatement Facility, tells me that while 
CSOs are a problem, he is more concerned about 
storm water as a source of pollution in the West River. 
However, he says, “I’m not trying to say [CSOs] are 
good. They’re part of the problem, and we have a long-
term plan to address those.”


The abatement facility, which processes waste and 
sewage for New Haven, Hamden, East Haven, and 
Woodbridge, is surprisingly picturesque, once you get 
past the primary treatment process and the sludge, and 
before you get to the incineration room. It’s situated 
on the shore of Long Island Sound, and surrounded by 
groves of trees that cut it off from the nearby residential 
areas. 


The first time Zrelak and I speak over the phone, it’s 
raining. He mentions that tonight will be one of those 
nights when the pipes overflow into the river, which 
makes the sound of rain on my roof a little less enjoy­
able than usual. On rainy days, when the pipes are 
over capacity, they are designed to release untreated 
sewage and storm water right into the river. The forty 
million gallons of sewage (the daily average, although 
it can increase by 100 million gallons on rainy days) 
that do make it to the treatment plant end up in giant 
covered tanks whose contents aren’t visible from above. 
They make their presence known by their smell: the 
solid waste is first filtered out of the sewage, leaving 
“grey water” that travels out through secondary treat­
ment. As it begins the bacterial treatment processes, 
the air begins to take on the not-quite-pleasant but 
not-quite-repugnant smell of living mud. By the time 
it passes through clarifiers and is disinfected with chlo­
rine, it is clear.


The solid waste, meanwhile, takes a different path. 
It ends up in the massive, multistory incinerator where 
the solid waste circulates and burns. As I peer into the 
incinerator’s flames, it occurs to me what challenges 
environmentalists contend with: often, the tradeoff for 
one problem brings another: we (mostly) no longer 
dump raw sewage into rivers or the sound, but sewage 
treatment creates some significant pollution if its own, 
including the air pollution caused by incineration.


By using green infrastructure, the coalition may be 
able to solve the problem, at least for CSOs, without 
making that trade.

Supporting the existing combined sewer system with 
green infrastructure requires less time and money than 
deconstructing the current system to rebuild two sep­
arate systems. Separating the sewage and storm water 
system would theoretically involve tearing up the 
streets and installing another system of pipes that carry 
storm water only. While the GNHWPCA has a long-
term plan to control CSOs, it will take decades. And, 
even then, the storm water runoff will continue to pol­
lute the bodies of water into which it flows. 


Instead, the coalition plans to eliminate sewage 
overflows by stopping storm water runoff from reaching 
the pipes in the first place. As the city of New Haven 
has become more and more developed, the runoff has 
increasingly become a cause of pollution in the river—
both because it causes sewage to overflow, and also 
because it is polluted. Small-scale innovations like the 
bioswales redirect the storm water runoff through natu­
ral means towards the major bodies of water. 


While pristine at its source, the West River grows 
increasingly polluted as a result of increased pave­
ment and streets that block the re-absorption of 
storm water. Forty percent of surfaces in the lower 
watershed are impenetrable, far above the threshold 
level of twelve percent—the level at which local riv­
ers begin to see degraded water quality as a result of 
storm water runoff. Unable to be absorbed into the 
soil, the storm water flows into the river, bringing 
pollutants with it. The river, unsurprisingly, suffers, 
as does Long Island Sound, into which West River 
ultimately empties. 


To extend conservation efforts beyond the bioswales 
and urban gardens, members of the coalition have gone 
house to house asking watershed inhabitants to discon­
nect their downspouts, which carry storm water directly 
from roofs to rain gutters. Local environmental activist 
Lynne Bonnet, who helped bring together the group 
that became the coalition, is working on gathering and 
distributing rain barrels, to help people store storm 
water on their property until the storms have cleared 
and the system is no longer overcapacity. The hope is 
that, when implemented on a large scale, smaller treat­
ment measures could eliminate runoff into the rivers 
altogether, and pave the way for a more sustainable 
water management system.              	


“To undo urbanization is not cheap and it’s not easy,” 
Mushinsky said, but the watershed plan also offers what 
she says is the “easiest and cheapest” solutions to the 
problem. “When you have to dig up a whole street and 
install a storage for sewage overflow or some of those 
big projects, those are just so expensive that they’re 
going to take decades to do. But the smaller ones, dis­
connecting people’s downspouts … that kind of thing is 
just a cultural change. We just have to go through the 
neighborhoods and educate people to do it.”


In addition to small-scale intervention, the coalition 
intends to reinvigorate community connection to New 
Haven’s bodies of water. As demonstrated by the coali­
tion and its members, when people feel connected to 
the rivers, they work to improve them. Currently, much 
of the river and its tributaries remain blocked by either 
steep banks or private property. Improving access will 
hopefully further entrench community commitment to 
improving the water’s pollution. So far, the coalition 
is working to create an unbroken walking path along 
the West River, given it recently received greenway 
designation. At Common Ground High School, stu­
dents are working on ways to increase access to Winter­
green Brook, a tributary of the West River that runs by 
their campus. 


Already, the West River Watershed coalition has suc­
ceeded in bringing together a diverse group commu­
nity members—including people who live in the Mill 
and Quinnipiac watersheds—and uniting them around 
the rivers. The plan provided them with a vision of how 
to achieve a New Haven with effective management of 
both sewage and storm water. They hope they will one 
day see the waters restored to their natural state.

THE HOPE IS THAT, WHEN 
IMPLEMENTED ON A LARGE 
SCALE, SMALLER TREATMENT 
MEASURES COULD 
ELIMINATE RUNOFF INTO 
THE RIVERS ALTOGETHER, 
AND PAVE THE WAY FOR A 
MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
