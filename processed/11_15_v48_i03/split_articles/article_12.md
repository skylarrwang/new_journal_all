keeping the children quiet and attentive while Mickel­
son’s voice remains calm and level, commanding the 
attention and even awe of the kids. 

Every child on the bus raised his or her hand in 
response to the question.

“What do you do at the library?” Mickelson’s voice 
contained an energy that permeated the room. 
“Read books!” 
“Do you like to read stories?” 
A little boy named Caden nearly jumped out of his 
seat: “Yes, we do!” 
Mickelson opened up a picture book that had been sit­
ting on her lap, holding it so the children could see the 
pictures inside. She must have read the book a hundred 
times before, but she acted as if she were reading it for the 
first time, like the children. The book, called Wild About 
Books, tells the story of a bookmobile for animals—an 
approach that is heavy-handed in its self-promotion, but 
is also effective in capturing the attention of the kids, who 
connect the story to the bus they’re sitting on. “By reading 
aloud from the good Dr. Seuss, she quickly attracted a 
mink and a moose. A wombat, an onyx, a lemur, a lynx, 
eight elephant calves and a family of skunks,” she read. 
The children’s teachers occasionally had to redirect their 
attention to the story, because they were distracted by all 
the books waiting behind them, trying to decipher the 
titles or pull them out of the shelves to inspect the pic­
tures inside. Sometimes, the kids got carried away in their 
excitement as they responded to one of Mickelson’s sup­
plementary questions (“how tall is an elephant?”), chat­
tering on over the exact height of an elephant. 
When story time ended, the session finished with a cho­
rus of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” Afterward, the chil­
dren shuffled to the door. Someone asked eagerly, “Are 
we going to the playground?” As the last girl reached the 
stairs, she turned to face Mickelson and waved. “Thank 
you!” she called.

Throughout the fall and spring, the bookmobile 
rolls down the streets of New Haven, from East Rock to 
Newhallville, Westville to Fair Haven. Between October 
2014 and October 2015, the bookmobile had 4,350 pro­
gram attendees, 2,774 books checked out, 112 site visits, 
and 180 new library cards issued at schools all across 
New Haven, but especially at early learning centers like 
Blake Street. According to Xia Feng, who administers the 
New Haven Library’s Young Minds Program, most early 
learning centers lack the library spaces for older kids that 
exist in public schools, and there are only five commu­
nity libraries across the city. The bookmobile tries to 
fill that gap.

Focusing on early learning centers, however, con­
strains the bookmobile’s reach: just under half of New 
Haven’s 8,500 children under the age of four are enrolled 
in early learning programs. The bookmobile also visits 
summer camps, block parties, and the annual tree light­
ing on the New Haven Green, but this doesn’t leave the 
time or resources for general neighborhood visits, which 
might allow people to stumble serendipitously upon the 
bookmobile. According to Catherine DeNigris, the New 
Haven Free Public Library’s deputy director, other chal­
lenges include the weather, which keeps the bookmobile 
from going out during January and February. “Ideally we 
would want the bookmobile on the road more,” she said. 

When almost any form of media can be streamed at 
the push of a button, the sight of children elbowing one 
another for books is inherently nostalgic. But Mickelson 
believes that libraries are still relevant, especially in areas 
where young children don’t have easy access to books at 
home. Story time, DeNegris said, is “a tradition that has 
been around forever but is still totally viable,” since it cre­
ates a gathering place and social experience for children. 
Though the bookmobile may not have the same reach or 
accessibility as broader digital initiatives, it has something 
those projects don’t: a physical space and a tactile reading 
experience that together make a lasting emotional impact 
on kids.

At the end of the second session at Blake Street, 
the children were asked to pretend they were holding 
books of their own. “What do you see in your book?” 
Mickelson asked. 
“I see mushrooms!” “I see geese!” Almost every child 
stared into their hands as if they were really holding a 
book. I caught the eye of one little girl; she smiled, briefly, 
then turned back to the story she was developing in 
her palms.
