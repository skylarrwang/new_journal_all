of the city’s highest crime rates. The division troubles 
her, and she takes to radio to talk about it. 
Radio is a way for Salwa to feel in control. “Usually 
I just go home and say, ‘I’m upset about this, and this,’ 
but now I get to say ‘I’m upset about this, and this,’ 
and people are listening to me,” she says. She says her 
friends from school listen to her show. She’s infectiously
optimistic, but she still remembers how difficult it 
was to talk about her illness with her family. 
“There’s this stigma in the African American community
about mental illness that’s kind of like, ‘Get over 
it,’” she says. It’s something she hopes to eventually 
confront through radio. “In the future, I’d hopefully 
have my own show. I think I’m going to do a whole 
series about mental illness and not be afraid of talking 
about it.” 
A few weeks after hearing Onyeka Obiocha on 
Urban Talk Radio, I went to The Happiness Lab. He 
stood behind the counter when I entered, taking a 
detailed pour-over order from the man at the register. 
A dark, curly beard, eyes crinkled into a steady smile, 
a baseball cap—he looked exactly like he did on the 
Independent page. He asked for my order in a voice
 I already knew well.
“I heard you on Urban Talk Radio,” I said. Oh, and 
a latte, too.
Obiocha raised his eyebrows before he started gently 
chuckling. He turned away from me in mock disbelief. 
“You’re the first,” he finally said. “I hope I sounded OK.” 
Swaby came in a few minutes later, followed by an­
other host from the station, which is only a few blocks 
away. I waved at them and Obiocha when I left, skirting
around the society of the knuckleheads, dreamers, 
schemers, what have you. 
I biked home the long way at 4:00 p.m. WNHH’s 
Spanish-language programming was starting. I imagined
the waves flying past my face, holding a quiet 
density, trying to squeeze past tall buildings and sometimes
making it. I couldn’t hear them at that moment, 
of course—instead, cars horns wailed and dissolved. A 
bus sighed as it came to a stop, and as the passengers 
hopped off, I caught only the beginnings and ends of 
muddled words that grazed my ears. The air, a tangle 
of energy, buzzed.
