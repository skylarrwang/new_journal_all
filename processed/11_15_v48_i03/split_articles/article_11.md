enoc escobar watched cormorants glide inches above 
the waves of the Long Island Sound. Alex Mass noticed 
the way sandy bluffs slide towards the sea, and Alyssa Hall 
contemplated the impending flooding of downtown Man­
hattan by the water through which they sailed.

“By the end of the century, it’s going to go up two feet,” 
she warned.


As the three students told me about their educational 
voyage through the Long Island Sound, they painted a 
picture of a complex, important, and unexpectedly beau­
tiful body of water in unsettling flux.  

All three were serving as sailors aboard the schooner 
Brilliant, and all three are seniors at New Haven’s Sound 
School, a vocational charter high school that focuses on 
aquaculture and marine trades, where students learn 
about the sea in the classroom and on the water. This 
year’s inaugural Brilliant Marine Ecology Program offered 
seven students at the Sound School a special opportunity 
to do both, as they conducted research projects on ecolog­
ical topics related to the Long Island Sound. Enoc investi­
gated seabird adaptations, while the other two focused on 
closely related current environmental issues. Alyssa stud­
ied sea level change, and Alex researched coastal erosion 
in New England, which is becoming more severe as the 
waters rise.


They saw their topics of inquiry firsthand during the 
sea component of the program, which culminated in a 
three-day, forty-mile, round-trip odyssey through the 
Long Island Sound. From Mystic, Connecticut, to Fish­
er’s Island, through the Watch Hill Passage, a.k.a. “seasick 
alley”, to Block Island, and back again, the students got 
the chance to experience the Sound firsthand.


The blending of classroom and hands-on learning in 
the Brilliant Program captures the essence of the Sound 
School, where, as Steve Joseph, one of the teachers who 
went on the trip, told me, “the Long Island Sound is our 
biggest classroom.”


The Sound School has had direct access to this natu­
ral classroom since 1995, when it moved to its waterfront 
location in New Haven’s City Point neighborhood. Since 
its founding in 1981, it has prepared kids to be stewards of 
the Long Island Sound, a mission it is joined in by other 
vocational high schools, like Marine Science Magnet 
High School in Groton, and the Aquaculture Science & 
Technology Education Center in Bridgeport. Students at 
all three institutions are exploring the challenges of the 
changing waters.

“We just went through a really tremendous warm 
spell,” said Tim Visel, coordinator of the school’s voca­
tional program. “In 1998, the lobsters died. In 1999, our 
blue crabs exploded.”


The past few years have been colder, and blue crabs, 
which prefer warm water, are giving way to lobsters again. 
Similar cycles have been occurring for as long as records 
exist, said Visel, who does extensive historical research 
on ecological patterns in the Sound. But, as the climate 
changes, cold spells are getting farther apart. As lobsters 
now run the risk of dying off in Connecticut, the Sound 
School’s aquaculture program started a lobster hatchery a 
few years ago. 

“We’re trying to educate people on farming the sea,” he 
told me of his work with students on the aquaculture track, 
as we toured the lab where much of this education occurs. 
“We’ve got one of the largest shellfish labs in the coun­
try here,” he added. The room, with its rows of bubbling 
tanks and networks of pipes, valves and filters, looked wor­
thy of Monterey Bay Aquarium or Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. But, like the wooden-boat workshops and 
outboard engine repair rooms of the marine technology 
program, it is run primarily by high school students. In 
their applications to the school, teenagers must demon­
strate a strong interest in the marine. Besides being the 
overall focus of the vocational programs, the ocean seeps 
its way into every part of the school’s curriculum.

“Even in our core classes, we’re doing more ocean-re­
lated stuff,” said Alex. “Like in English, we’re reading sea 
poems, instead of just normal poems. Teachers really try 
to relate the ocean to what we do.”

“But we still love our core classes—we don’t just go on 
boats all day,” added Alyssa, who, like Alex and Enoc, is 
on the sailing team. Tim Visel compared the sailing team, 
along with the top-notch open-water rowing team, to “our 
school’s version of football.”

“We’re ones to be reckoned with,” said Gabriel Neil 
Geist, an assistant coach for the rowing team. A short, 
soft-spoken, man who looked like he had stepped out 
of an L. L. Bean catalog, Geist is a 1988 graduate of the 
Sound School, whose return to his alma mater makes 
him feel, he said, “like the luckiest man alive.” 

On a warm October afternoon, we stood on a grassy 
lawn between the school and the harbor, watching five- 
and seven-person boats that would look appropriate chas­
ing whales in eighteenth-century etchings. Each crew of 
students sped away from the shore. 

“Look, they just crashed,” Geist said, more amused 
than worried, as one group, pushed off course by a brisk 
sea breeze, tapped the side of a moored boat. Flustered 
and disorganized, the rowers struggled to manoeuver back 
into open water.


They passed over small beds of oysters, started and 
maintained by students and teachers as replacements for 
ones that had died off over the past century. City Point, 
once a successful oystering community, had been on the 
decline since the nineteen-fifties, when the construction 
of Interstate 95 cut it off from in rest of New Haven. Even 
earlier, its oyster beds were plagued by pollution from a 
now-closed sewage treatment plant. When Geist was a 
student at the Sound School, the most prominent feature 
on the coastline was a shipyard where old boats were sent 
to be broken up for scrap.

“It really looked like an old, New England run-down 
seaside town,” Geist said. 

Now, where derelict boats once lined the coast, build­
ings that host the Sound School marine facilities share 
the waterfront. The Pequonnock Yacht Club moved in 
next door from Bridgeport in 2009. The rowboats set off 
from a marsh-lined shore, dotted with recently refur­
bished houses.


Seaside houses crumble and are rebuilt again. Cli­
mate changes and animal populations die. Even the 
brief return voyage of the Brilliant was plagued by the 
remnants of Hurricane Joaquin, which lashed waves 
into eight-foot swells and pelted the sailors’ backs with 
rain. But, as Enoc said, remembering the trials of the 
storm fondly, it’s all “part of bearing with nature.” The 
sea can indeed be a fickle being, and each new class at 
the Sound School enters a body of water surrounded by 
one of the most urbanized regions in America—and their 
studies there teach them that it’s also one of the most 
precarious ones.
