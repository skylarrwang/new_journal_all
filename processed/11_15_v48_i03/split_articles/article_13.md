The strangest performance space in New Haven
a typical trip to never ending books at 810 State 
Street delivers two things: disappointment and a ratty 
paperback. The lights will probably be off inside the store. 
In lieu of posting hours, owner Roger Uihlein maintains a 
shelf of free books outside the entrance. If, however, you 
pick an atypical day, the door will swing open to a fjord-
like set of bookshelves and a wall of literature devoted 
to the apparently one-dimensional realm of “women’s 
issues.” All of these books are free, too. If you plan your 
visit with unbelievable serendipity, you’ll end up at Never 
Ending Books on the second Monday of the given month, 
right in time for Expression Mondays.


About fifteen chairs face the curtained stage area, 
which is cast in a red light. Some of the New Haven resi­
dents are in their nine-to-five office casual, but the book­
store seems more like a friend’s apartment than a place of 
business. And, like a friend, Expression Mondays is only 
one of many recurring events to pass through the shop. 
The musicians and open-mic participants gather around, 
waiting for someone to jump in with original material or 
an homage. Uihlein’s attendance is never guaranteed. 
His manner of managing performances at the store is 
akin to setting wind-up toys in motion; for the most part, 
Uihlein trusts performers to “do their own thing.”


According to Robert Caruthers, a guitar-wielding 
emcee whose stage name is Bobcat, Expression Mon­
days were established “a bunch of years ago” on the 
West Coast. Harry Grammer, founder and CEO of the 
community outreach organization New Earth, wanted to 
create an environment in which people could perform 
without having to worry about record labels, agents, or 
career advancement. Eventually, the event grew beyond 
the walls of the café atmosphere, expanding into schools 
and correctional facilities. Bobcat had met Uihlein from 
the New Haven music scene, and when one of Gram­
mer’s disciples came to Bobcat in search of a venue, Bob­
cat knew the perfect location. 


Performance has been encoded into Never Ending 
Books from the start, and Uihlein saw the books as merely 
a means to an end. “The concept was to sell enough books 
to have the space,” he says. After the workday is over, the 
space—which resembles some musician’s dream living 
room, replete with an upright piano, soft chairs, and a col­
lection of vintage amplifiers–—could be used for classes, 
seminars, rehearsals, and concerts. Now that the books are 
free, the utility of the space hasn’t changed. Uihlein is


just much more open about lending the space out: there’s 
nothing to steal, and so long as the performer cleans up 
after themselves, he isn’t worried. Inquiries about finan­
cial ledgers are met with circumlocution; aside from 
small donations, the shop seems to draw life from the 
sounds that reverberate in its midst.


On the second Saturday of every month, Never Ending 
Books is the venue for the Uncertainty Music Series, the 
brainchild of New Haven artist Carl Testa. Testa’s “uncer­
tainty” is not manifest in indecision, but rather in the 
sheer breadth of his curatorial direction. In the archive of 
past concerts online and on the store’s flyer-studded win­
dows, you’ll find musicians whose work spans free jazz, 
minimalism, noise, musique concrète, IDM, and con­
temporary chamber music. Yale School of Music compo­
sition student Brian Heim, who performed for an Uncer­
tainty concert in September, says the venue gives him 
the “opportunity to listen more freely” to certain strains 
of music that “wouldn’t be as well received elsewhere.” 
For Uncertainty artists, Never Ending Books is a sort of 
proving ground, before they head to larger local venues 
like Firehouse 12 or The Big Room. 


Uihlein approaches the concert scheduling with non­
chalance. If someone whom he knows “well enough” 
asks to use the space, he’ll generally accept. And once 
the minimal promotional details are ironed out—“I don’t 
tell anyone about your gig,” he says—he backs off. It’s 
not uncommon for him to give performers the keys to 
the shop when he can’t make a concert. A semi-retired 
carpenter and occasional write-in candidate for Mayor of 
New Haven, Uihlein is quiet about how he spends his 
time. He’s a member of the New Haven Improvisers Col­
lective that performs regularly at Never Ending. On the 
Collective’s out-of-date webpage, which enumerates each 
player’s main instrument, Uihlein’s name appears near 
the very top of the list. His instrument? Propulsion.


While Uihlein’s presence is often felt from afar, 
at the Expression Monday I attend, he sits in the back 
and surveys the week’s expressionists. Bobcat ends his 
opening remarks with an admonition of sorts: “Here, 
you are encouraged—your arm may be twisted to 
express yourself.” 


A few folk songs round out Bobcat’s time on stage, and at 
the end of the last song, the room’s eyes turn to me. About 
twelve eager attendees greet me with hopeful gazes. For 
the first time, I realize that participation, whether through 
a twisted arm or my own volition, is the real entrance fee 
at Never Ending Books. The quality of my contribution, 
the consistency of my attendance—these are secondary 
to my obligation to take part in whatever exhibition has 
the store for the night. Uihlein trusts his musical tenants 
implicitly, and he seems to expect the same of those who 
chance on the store when it’s open for a concert. Beneath 
his indifferent air, he propels his patrons to reflect upon 
Never Ending’s musical liberality. I pay the creative tithe 
and sing one of my songs at the piano. Thinking that I’ve 
said what I had to say, I close the fallboard, but Uihlein’s 
voice rises above the encouraging applause. He wants me 
to play another.
