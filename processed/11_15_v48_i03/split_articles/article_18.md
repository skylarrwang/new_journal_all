present day. Each year, an estimated fourteen million 
gallons of untreated sewage flow into the West River, 
which runs through Bethany, Woodbridge, and New 
Haven before emptying into the harbor. The over­
flows are caused by storm water runoff: in cities and 
suburbs, where the soil is typically obstructed by lay­
ers of cement and pavement, the runoff can’t perme­
ate through to the soil. It either floods the streets or is 
directed to a management system via downspouts and 
gutters. In New Haven, the sewage and storm water sys­
tems are one and the same, leading to combined sewer 
overflows, or CSOs, during storms. Storm water com­
bines with sewage as it flows into the pipes, which are 
designed to overflow into the river when they exceed 
the sewage treatment plant’s capacity. And even before 
the storm water makes contact with sewage, it is a 
source of pollution:  it brings with it all the debris and 
pollution it has picked up on the sidewalks and streets, 
including chemicals, fertilizer, antifreeze, and animal 
feces. And the few residents who do regularly interact


new haven is a city of unseen rivers. In addition to 
sitting on the shores of the Long Island Sound, it is part 
of three separate watersheds—water runs off into three 
different rivers that run through the city: the Quinnip­
iac River, the Mill River, and the West River, the last 
of which is twenty-five miles long and, in New Haven, 
largely out of sight of the city dwellers.

“Some people honestly don’t even know that the 
river exists,” said Kendall Barbery, the Green Infra­
structure Program manager at the Connecticut Fund 
for the Environment/Save the Sound.

Yale, for its part, only widens the gap between people 
and the river. The athletic complex cuts off river access 
by cutting off the path trailing the West River with a 
large fence; while a sign reads, “PUBLIC ACCESS TO 
WEST RIVER: SUNRISE TO SUNSET,” the gate is 
padlocked shut.  

It should be no surprise, though, that locals have 
looked away from the rivers—for centuries, they have 
been sites of serious pollution, continuing up to the
