Bass has only been hosting Dateline for three months, 
but his long-standing track record as a New Haven 
journalist allows him to talk to people like Markley 
and Holder-Winfield like they’re old pals—often, they 
are. In the book The Wired City, about the founding of 
the Independent, author Dan Kennedy describes Bass 
as “single-handedly holding city hall accountable with 
his fierce reporting” during his stint at the now-defunct 
New Haven Advocate. He wrote for other publications, 
including the Connecticut section of The New York 
Times, Connecticut Magazine, and USA Today, but 
went rogue when he saw the local journalism scene 
dissolving. 
“I felt that corporate media monopolies had destroyed 
local journalism for the most part,” Bass told me, “and 
now everything has to be scaled up, including on the 
web.” In 2005, while local journalists lost their jobs 
and publications closed their doors around the nation, 
Bass started the Independent.  
Like the Independent at its inception, WNHH has 
filled an empty spot in the radio landscape. WNPR is a 
popular station, but it’s based in Hartford and is dominated by national NPR programming. WELI is based 
in New Haven, but the likes of national talking heads 
like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck fill its airwaves. 
Local WYBC (different from WYBCx, Yale College’s 
radio) claims to be “the rhythm of the city,” but it provides music, not discussion.

Where We Live, a daily morning talk show on WNPR, 
is one of the top radio programs for Connecticut-based, 
national, and global news. John Dankosky is the host—
he’s worked at WNPR for years, and many of the stories he’s reported in the state have been broadcast nationally on NPR. A month before WNHH launched, 
Bass asked Dankosky to give a workshop to the hosts to 
teach them the basics of interviewing. 
Unlike listeners of WNHH, those who tune in to 
WNPR and Dankosky’s show aren’t necessarily looking 
for hyper-local programming. 
“If you ask [our listeners] in the street what’s the story 
that’s really important to them, they may say the school 
board in their town, and they might also say the war 
in Afghanistan, or they may say what’s happening with 
the state budget,” Dankosky said. When we spoke, the 
day’s episode of Where We Live had just aired (following NPR’s Morning Edition). A thirteen-piece funk 
band from Hartford called West End Blend had played 
live, and Dankosky interviewed a Yale professor about 
the Iberian film festival she organizes. That’s pretty local. But there remains a divide between WNHH and 
WNPR when it comes to the intended audience of 
that coverage. 
“Public radio has a traditionally very educated, sometime wealthier audience. They tend to be older,” Dankosky said. WNPR is larger than WNHH, but compared 
to what Dankosky calls “big radio”—stations with the 
same voice tracking pop songs for hours—it’s still minuscule. They need money, as do similar stations across 
the country, and that often means getting it from the 
people who tune in faithfully and are likely to donate 
during pledge drives. While they try to attract young 
listeners, it’s still a balancing act. “If you turn away 
from the things that audience likes, you risk losing the 
funding base,” he said.  
WNHH doesn’t have to worry about that. As a low 
power station, they’re funded by grants that Bass applied for years ago instead of by ads, and the future 
of the station depends on getting more grants in the 
coming years. This financial freedom explains why 
Bass cares less about spreading the gospel of WNHH 
than the public radio hosts who spend days doing 
pledge drives for their stations. “We’re not doing any 
billboards or ads on buses,” Bass said. “The way we 
built the Independent was one by one. Every time we 
did a story, people would find out about it because you 
interviewed them. And I feel like we can do it the same 
way, piece by piece, by word of mouth.” His publicity 
model is, essentially, to do his job. 
That’s how Gellman found out about the Independent. When she came to New Haven for a fellowship 
at the Yale University Art Gallery, she didn’t predict 
she’d end up behind the controls at WNHH. After a 
few months at the Gallery, though, she felt stuck in the 
Yale scene.
“I had been profoundly lonely when I moved here,” 
she told me. “I made a couple friends through Yale and 
met the guy who is now my boyfriend, but when you 
move to a new place…” She trailed off. A colleague 
had told her about the Independent, which had an 
opening for a music writer. She started claiming assignments. Trying to get away from Yale herself, she noticed limitations in the Independent’s music coverage.
“We weren’t covering Cafe 9. We weren’t covering 
Bar or Stella Blues, and we weren’t covering anything 
in the Hill, Dixwell, or Newhallville,” she said. “New 
Haven is such a tale of two cities. There are a lot of 
poor white people, there are a lot of poor Black people, and there are a lot of poor Latino and Hispanic 
people, and they’re all in different neighborhoods,” she 
explained. “Sometimes, music venues are what bring 
them together.”


So, four nights a week, Gellman, who describes herself as a “crunchy granola Jew,” set out to report. After 
working a full day at the YUAG, she’d go to performances around the city, sometimes staying up until 2 
a.m. to finish a story for the next day. 
She covered the music beat for over a year. The 
more she wrote for the Independent, the more lukewarm she felt about her pending Ph.D. applications. 
She had reservations about leaving New Haven, which 
she had come to love one concert at a time. So, when 
she was accepted to Duke, Paul Bass offered her a different job: the station manager of a new radio station. 
For any media venture, finding an audience is critical—and tricky. Aliyya Swaby, a 2013 Yale graduate 
who hosts the transportation-themed show In Transit 
on Monday afternoons, told me that she simply doesn’t 
know what kind of people listen to her show. She 
thinks, though, that they probably aren’t her age. Even 
with an online presence, getting young people to listen 
to an hour of radio is difficult when many of them are 
used to picking and choosing their own news. Getting 
their attention often depends on editing and scripts to 
add on-demand entertainment value; WNHH is less 
predictable. The Independent could feasibly do away 
with the satellite dish and only upload their content 
online—it’s something Bass says may happen in the 
future. But, for now, sending their shows out into the 
airwaves still allows potential listeners to stumble upon 
it while driving. There’s less choice on a radio dial than 
on the Internet—with fewer places to turn when they 
lose interest, maybe listeners are likelier to be lured 
out of momentary boredom by terrestrial radio.


On one of her episodes, Swaby interviewed Doug 
Hausladen, who directs the city’s Department of Transportation, Traffic and Parking. (He’s also a water polo 
coach at Yale, and his voice has the energy the job 
demands.) Hausladen, blond and with the build of a 
once-brawny athlete, is well known in New Haven and 
the WNHH office. When he entered the studio, he instinctively hung up his suit jacket on the door hook. 
We started talking about whether people were tuning 
in to WNHH. 
“The number of people that know that I almost 
burned my house down during the cooking experience I talked about on Lucy’s show?” he offered. “It’s 
pretty impressive how many people heard that story.” 
There’s no way of knowing how many people heard 
it on the air, but SoundCloud shows that seventy-seven people heard the episode, and the count gradually 
keeps growing. 
“It’s interesting,” Hausladen said. “I have more work 
to do now that WNHH exists. It used to be that I 
could just read the newspaper article, and I could read 
it quickly. Now I have to listen to an hour of radio.” 
It’s the mindset of the Independent as embodied by 
WNHH: to really live somewhere, New Haven or elsewhere, you have to pay attention. You have to listen.

On the curb outside the Independent’s offices on 
51 Elm Street, Shafiq Abdussabur is standing with his 
17-year-old daughter Salwa, who’s dressed in head-to-
toe magenta. For the Abdussaburs, radio is a family 
affair. Today, Salwa and her mother Mubarakah Ibrahim—who is broadcasting her own show on WNHH as 
we stand on the sidewalk—will be guests on Shafiq’s 
show. Though most kids her age are in class during 
Wednesday mornings like this, Salwa recently withdrew from her charter high school, choosing homeschool instead. After parking his silver minivan, Shafiq 
shakes my hand and says hello in the same baritone 
I’ve heard on air. He and Salwa climb the stairs to the 
Independent offices. 
Mubarakah is already inside the studio wrapping up 
Mornings with Mubarakah, which airs an hour before 
her husband’s Urban Talk Radio. “First we talked about 
doing a show together,” she told me. “Then, in my full 
feminist voice, I was like, ‘Nope! I want my own show!’” 
Like the rest of the family, when Mubarakah laughs, 
she doesn’t giggle—it’s always loud and full. 
   Mubarakah often talks about women’s health for her 
show, covering mindfulness, estrogen in grocer store 
chicken breasts, and obesity. She’s the founder of Fit 
Haven, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing health disparities affecting women and girls, and she used to run 
a gym called BALANCE Fitness Studios. She also has 
a project called Fit Muslimah, an on- and off-line community of Muslim women for whom she leads private 
fitness retreats, since many Muslim women don’t exercise outside of their homes. In 2007, she was on the 
Oprah Winfrey Show for an episode about impressive 
thirty-somethings in America. Now, her accumulated Facebook following is upwards of 205,000 people, 
numbers Bass doesn’t hesitate to admit he cares about.

For Mubarakah, issues like Islam in America and 
what it means to be a Black woman are hard to get 
away from, since they’re parts of her everyday life. Radio, she says, “is my intersection.” It’s where she can 
talk about all of them at once, to people who might 
never hear about them otherwise. 
Shafiq and Salwa arrive at the office and greet Bass, 
who tells Shafiq to pick out one of the WNHH sweatshirts from a cardboard box that just arrived. Salwa slips 
into the studio and takes a seat at the head of the table. 
Her mother sits to her left in a sweater and hijab, both 
scarlet, and her father is on the right. The studio is tiny, 
but WNHH enables the Abdussaburs’ conversation to 
expand beyond its walls. And it’s easy conversation—
they crack jokes, laugh the same rousing laugh, and 
nod their heads in time with the jazz Gellman sends 
through their headphones before the top of the hour. 
Salwa is often a guest on her parents’ shows for brief 
segments called Sass Talkin’ With Salwa. Her elevator pitch requires some choreography: “Sassy is saying 
what you think and meaning what you say, and being, 
like, ‘hey,’” she told me, snapping her fingers, popping 
a hip, and giggling. 
Salwa decided to withdraw from high school because she was diagnosed with depression. She calls 
her current routine “doing her own thing.” Part of that 
thing is preparing her Sass Talkin’ segments, which, 
for now, mostly means reading aloud essays on Urban 
Talk Radio. Today, she’ll talk about economic disparity 
with her parents and describe the feeling of attending 
a Shakespeare festival at Edgerton Park in East Rock, a 
wealthy neighborhood surrounded by areas with some
