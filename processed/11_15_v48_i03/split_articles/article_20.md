WHO PROTECTS PICASSO?
P R O F I L E
Through the eyes of a guard at the Yale University Art Gallery 
Lora Kelley
“What is a museum guard to do, I thought to myself; 
what, really, is a museum guard? On the one hand, you 
are a member of a security force charged with protecting 
priceless materials from the crazed or kids or the slow 
erosive force of camera flashes; on the other hand you are 
a dweller among supposed triumphs of the spirit.”
— From Leaving the Atocha Station, Ben Lerner
it’s noon, and Imani Lane looks over forty-seven tiny 
security screens spread across two PC monitors. Lane 
has been a guard at the Yale University Art Gallery for 
more than thirteen years. After years on the floor, she 
now also works at the front desk in the Nolen Center, 
the museum education building across the street from 
the Gallery. She scans the screens for movements the 
on-floor guides might miss. When visitors walk through 
the galleries, sit on benches, or encounter a Van Gogh 
for the first time, Lane is watching. 
As a guard, especially when in the gallery, Lane is 
tasked with helping patrons. But, mostly, her job is not 
to get in the way. “We’re supposed to be invisible,” she 
says. It’s difficult to imagine Lane, who is bubbly and 
effusive, fading into the background. Lane laughs often 
when she talks. She is at ease in her black leather office 
chair, wearing a uniform of a blue button-up shirt, kha­
kis, and clogs. But she emphasizes that the role of a 
guard is to maintain order, not to “to bother or talk too 
much to people in the gallery.”

It can be tough not to talk, especially when patrons 
want to address Lane. “When you’re in an art gallery, 
you can get emotional,” Lane says, and visitors some­
times look to her to unload their reflections. Van Gogh’s 
Night Café, in particular, often moves people to talk. 
Lane just listens and nods politely. When people ask if 
she likes the art, she can’t share her opinions. But, at 
her desk away from the art, Lane makes it clear that her 
natural impulse would be to engage enthusiastically 
with visitors.

A few minutes into our conversation, a museum 
patron wanders out of the elevator near Lane’s desk, 
looking lost. Interrupting herself mid-sentence, Lane 
greets him, “Hi, how are you doing? Welcome to the 
Nolen Center. Are you looking for the way out?” The 
man responds yes, revealing his French accent. Imme­
diately, Lane asks, “Parlez vous Francais?” and, when 
he nods, she adds, “Je m’appelle Imani.” He grins 
and asks if she speaks Spanish, too. Lane replies, “un 
pocito,” before laughing and giving him directions to 
the exit (in English).

Sending the tourist off in the elevator, Lane mod­
estly shrugs. “You meet so many people from around 
the world, you want to be able to say something.”

Lane fondly recalls the excitement of getting on 
the train with her class as a kid in New York City and 
visiting the Museum of Natural History, the Tomb of 
Perneb at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the 
MoMA. This early love of museums has stayed with 
her, and she thinks all her fellow guards share it at least 
to some extent. “You couldn’t work here and not like 
the art, ” she says. “You can’t tune it out.”


When there aren’t visitors in the galleries 
she’s guarding, Lane switches from being a guard—
watching people watching art—into being a patron 
of the museum. She fixes her gaze on her favorite
 pieces, focusing on one or two at a time. “I love objects 
that look like they’re in motion,” she says. 
When I meet Lane again, this time in the lobby of 
the Yale University Art Gallery, we take the elevator up 
to the Modern and Contemporary section to visit The 
Knife Grinder, one of Lane’s favorite paintings. In it, a 
man hunched over a knife pushes through geometric 
shapes. It’s a cubo-figurist piece. Shapes radiate out­
ward from the central figure as multiple iterations of 
each of his body parts repeat in shades of orange, blue, 
and grey.

LANE STANDS STILL AS HER 
WELL-PRACTICED GAZE CUTS 
EASILY TO THE CENTER OF 
THE PAINTING, TO THE KNIFE 
IN THE FIGURE’S HANDS. SHE 
FOCUSES ON THE SLITS AND 
ANGLES ON THE CANVAS; 
THEY REMIND HER OF THE 
FLIPBOOKS SHE USED TO 
MAKE IN ART CLASS AS A KID.

Lane stands still as her well-practiced gaze cuts eas­
ily to the center of the painting, to the knife in the fig­
ure’s hands. She focuses on the slits and angles on the 
canvas; they remind her of the flipbooks she used to 
make in art class as a kid. “The more you look at it, 
the more you notice the movement of the knife,” Lane 
notes. Then she starts to recount the progression of her 
relationship to this work: at first she was puzzled by the 
knife, since when she looks at a painting for the first 
time, she never reads the labels. (She waits until she 
has explored the painting on her own.) “For a while 
when I first saw it I was like ‘is that a fork?’” She told 
herself, “Let me figure it out.” So she asked questions. 
Where is the figure standing? Is he in a basement? Is 
he using the knife to create or destroy? She muses, 
“Sometimes I don’t want to know too much because 
that wouldn’t leave as much for me to do on my own.” 
Looking closely, Lane cycles slowly through the 
museum’s collection, interpreting and re-interpret­
ing. But then, as soon as a visitor walks in, she snaps 
to attention. She needs to make sure that the art is out 
of harm’s way.

The Gallery holds pieces by Picasso, Brancusi, Rot­
hko, and Fra Angelico, to name a few. But, for most of 
her day, Lane is not focusing her gaze on brushstrokes. 
Instead, she says, “I make sure no little children are 
crawling on the floor crying that they lost their mom­
mies” and “I’m just here to make sure the art stays on 
the walls.” She scans the corners of the room in case 
someone trips on a bench. From her perch at her secu­
rity desk, she focuses more on the moving shapes of vis­
itors than the tiny, static art on the gallery walls. She is 
constantly watching to make sure no one gets too close 
to the art. “Everyone has the urge to touch,” she says.

Leaning in, as if telling me a secret, Lane describes 
her dream exhibit: the full a tactile museum space. She 
envisions a “touch gallery” with touchable copies of 
famous pieces. Instead of discouraging tactile engage­
ment, this space would sanctify it. She pictures a space 
filled with reproductions of the museum’s greatest hits. 
She has a specific room in mind, one in the basement 
of the YUAG that has an empty wall. Visitors (and 
Lane) could view pieces that, she says, for example, 
will “Feel and look just like an actual Picasso. And you 
can touch it.” 

There would still be guards in this gallery, to help 
out if someone trips or if a kid wanders in unaccom­
panied. But the works would not need to be watched 
so vigilantly. This dream space would make Lane’s life 
as a guard easier. In this touch gallery, she imagines, 
“people can hopefully get the touchies out of them,” 
so upstairs they would not try to touch original works. 
Lane prefers when she does not need to stop visitors 
from doing what they want to do. When visitors come 
in, she says she always thinks, “I don’t want to talk to 
you,” hoping that the patron will not cause trouble. 

Lane develops all kinds of plans while in the gal­
lery, and she acts on some. After hours looking at Picas­
sos, she had the idea to start sketching famous Picasso 
paintings “from a security guard’s perspective” in her 
free time. She just ordered some fabrics on eBay to 
start sewing dresses inspired by patterns in paintings. 
“All these ideas come from me working here, me being 
around the art handling, the exhibitions department, 
conservation,” she says.

The museum guard does a delicate dance—protect­
ing art while trying not to interfere with the onlooker’s 
experience. In the tactile gallery of Lane’s imagina­
tion, this task might be easier. But for the moment, she 
continues to guard the space, eyes flickering across the 
canvases or computer screens, absorbing all the angles.
