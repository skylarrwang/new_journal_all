THE  NEW  JOURNAL
includes color illustrations and articles on Black histo­
ries. A portrait of Christ as a Black man, surrounded by 
Black apostles, watches over the entire store from the 
back wall. 

The store’s motto is “Selling us on ourselves.” To 
Dozier-Taylor, drawing attention to Black struggles and 
accomplishments both in cultural and religious con­
texts not only instills greater pride in Black patrons and 
heightens awareness in non-Black patrons, but also cor­
rects misrepresentations of history. Still, she says, while 
most appreciate the Blackprint section of the store, 
some visitors of color take issue with Dozier-Taylor’s 
decision to only display images and works that portray 
Biblical figures as dark-skinned Semitic people. 

“I often run into this sentiment of ‘Don’t touch my 
Jesus!’” says Dozier-Taylor. “Or people say, ‘Just know­
ing Jesus is enough,’ as if I was politicizing everything 
by showing him as a dark-skinned man. And that’s 
another thing I hear, especially from Black men—‘I 
ain’t gonna worship some white man.’ But because I do 
know Jesus and how important he is, I respond, ‘Well, 
if that’s your problem, get yourself a Black one!’”

She adds, “Look, it’s not only about presenting an 
alternative image. Answer me this: do you think Joseph 
would have been able to hide Jesus in Egyptland if 
Jesus looked like a Scandinavian?”

Dozier-Taylor works to make the bookstore a bea­
con in the community. She has, over the years, offered 
advice to other Black entrepreneurs on the verge of 
opening their own businesses. She opens her doors to 
people from the neighborhood who have businesses 
but might not yet have an office, particularly business­
women of color who need a space to meet with clients. 
The bookstore also hosts events showcasing Black 
artists. At a book signing and reading in mid-October, 
self-published African American author Jill Snyder 
read from a book of love letters between her mother 
and father during their courtship in the nineteen-thir­
ties. People filtered in and out of the event, and at any 
given time over the several-hour-long period there 
were roughly ten people in attendance, all Black, all 
local, all engaged. 

Snyder explained to her audience that she viewed 
creating the book, entitled Dear Mary, Dear Luther, 
as an exploration of family histories that long untold. 
In researching her mother and father, she found docu­
mentation of her grandparents and great-grandparents, 
the latter of whom were enslaved, and had fled slavery, 
in the American South. 

“My grandmother always said our ancestors escaped 
slavery in Virginia,” Snyder recalled. “But I only had 
that as an anecdote, something people weren’t really 
willing to speak on because it was too painful. When 
I found my great-grandfather’s obituary, it finally val­
idated his story and brought to light some of this lit­
tle-known Black history.”

Snyder spoke to her frustration with widespread 
portrayals of Black men as being rough and crude. 
An exchange of written love letters, she pointed out, 
is a form of romance seldom afforded Black men in 
their depictions in novels and other media. She added 
that her father, during the time she knew him, always 
appeared a hard and stoic man. Finding his tender let­
ters was a revelation in and of itself.

“Here is the heart of my father,” she said, fanning 
the dog-eared pages of her book. “He put his heart 
on paper.” 

Dozier-Taylor hopes that such events impact her 
neighborhood. Several friends have urged her to move 
downtown, for increased safety and foot traffic, but stay­
ing in Dwight is important to her. “We often have so 
much fear of our own communities,” she says. “Despite 
all our love, there is this fear, and it’s a strange dance 
we do. I wrestled with that for a long time, wondering 
whether it wasn’t some kind of punishment that I was 
here. But recently it became very clear to me: I am 
here precisely because I am not afraid. I know that this 
is where God always intended me to be.”

Behind the building that houses A Walk in Truth 
and Blackprint is a small backyard garden, between 
the store and the neighboring Antillean housing proj­
ect. Up against the fence of the yard is a bright mosaic 
depicting Black men, women, and children. Beside the 
mosaic is a grey stone cross. 

“Remember that this space is, first and foremost, a 
place of exchange,” Dozier-Taylor explains. “For peo­
ple to exchange ideas, perspectives, hope, and love. 
That mosaic is showing you an indaba—a place to 
meet, a place to gather, a place to exchange. And that 
is what I try to do here: give people their indaba.”

Over the nearly three decades Dozier-Taylor has 
occupied her corner, she has seen the neighborhood 
around her change. She has seen businesses open and 
close. She has seen old liquor stores pack up and new 
schools open. She has seen schools torn down to make 
room for condominiums. She has watched and aided 
the growth of Black entrepreneurs, just as she has seen 
Black tenants wracked with rent from white landlords. 
Through it all, she has built and nurtured a space of 
safety, learning, and welcome for her community. 
Through it all, the indaba’s doors stay open.
