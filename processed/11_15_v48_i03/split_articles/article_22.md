EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
halfway through a show on New Haven’s new lo­
cal radio station, Onyeka Obiocha is talking about rural 
Tanzanian villages. But, as is standard on WNHH, the 
conversation loops back to the city. Obiocha’s warm, 
tenor voice describes how the beans make their way to 
his downtown coffee shop, The Happiness Lab. Shafiq 
Abdussabur, the host of Urban Talk Radio, asks him 
about the ins and outs of the business in a voice that 
can command a room. Adbussabur takes measured, 
attention-grabbing pauses between sentences as if he 
were speaking to an audience of thousands. He sounds 
like he’s been doing this for a while. 

Near the end of the show, Obiocha asks if he can 
explain some of his business’s philosophy. “Now that 
I hopefully have one or two people’s ears here—” he 
begins, but Abdussabur interrupts: “You have ten 
thousand ears!” He’s joking, and the men laugh again. 
They know they don’t have ten thousand ears, not even 
close—but they’re still in the studio, broadcasting, for 
the sake of local news.

Abdussabur had never done radio before August, but 
he has since hosted episodes about gun violence, polic­
ing, a local arts nonprofit, and urban biking, to name a 
few. Most days, he works as a New Haven police officer 
and treasurer of the New Haven Police Union. Now 
he can also call himself a radio personality. He and 
the hosts of twenty-five other shows make up the voices 
of WNHH, the city’s newest independent news source, 
which launched in August. There are shows about pol­
itics, sports, books, businesses, cooking, and local mu­
sic. Two hours a day are dedicated to Spanish-language 
programming. Mayor Toni Harp comes into the studio 
on Mondays, and a man named Joe Ugly hosts three 
hours of talk radio and local hip-hop each morning. 
WNHH is an attempt to inject New Haven’s airwaves 
with conversation by and for locals, with stories that 
national news outlets often overlook. As it becomes 
easier and easier for people to curate the news they 
want to hear, whether with podcasts or topic-specific 
apps, WNHH stands by the belief that tuning in, with­
out the ability to control what you might hear, is what 
it really means to be in the know. 

Unlike New Haven’s more established stations, 
WNHH is classified as “low power,” a type of FM ra­
dio license for nonprofits. After the Telecommunica­
tions Act of 1996, national radio groups were allowed 
to buy clumps of smaller stations and turn them into 
corporate chains. Suddenly, many once-autonomous 
stations across the country were broadcasting identical 
content. The FCC created the “low power” license in 
2000 as an answer, giving people the ability to broad­
cast independently, albeit with a weaker signal. These 
same large companies then lobbied for the Radio 
Broadcasting Preservation Act in the same year, limit­
ing the growth of low power stations in order to avoid 
interference with high power, commercial ones. Grass­
roots activists spent more than ten years fighting for 
their right to broadcast until Congress finally passed 
the Local Community Radio Act of 2010. 

WNHH is one of the successful applicants for the 
new low power licenses. That means that it’s part of a 
small but growing community of independent stations. 
Today, there are more than 1,300 in the U.S., many 
of which are Spanish-language or run by Christian 
groups. They often serve a hyper-specific listenership, 
priding themselves on their locality, their honesty, and 
their ruthlessly unedited material. It’s the spirit of pi­
rate radio, upgraded to legal status. At a time when 
podcasts—with soundtracks, charming quips, and art­
ful room noise—dictate the marketable future of radio, 
low power stations and their advocates hold on tightly 
to a certain grittiness (though the FCC still doesn’t al­
low them to swear).

But WNHH isn’t just trying to combat the Goliaths 
of media; it wants to inform, and sound like, its home 
city. It works in concert with the New Haven Indepen­
dent, a local online news publication meant for “the 
knuckleheads to the dreamers and schemers, and ev­
eryone in between,” according to the site’s mission 
statement. Both WNHH and the Independent operate 
out of two rooms on the third floor of a downtown brick 
building. The leader of the five-person team that runs 
both is Paul Bass, Yale class of 1982, who founded the 
Independent in 2005. 

WNHH’s signal spans only about three miles, reach­
ing north of New Haven but breaking up when blocked 
by tall buildings downtown. (When I first tuned in, 
blips of a Katy Perry song from another station inter­
rupted the signal.) To make up for this deficit, WNHH 
relies heavily on its presence on the Independent web­
site, where audio content is increasingly finding its 
home. Each episode is uploaded to SoundCloud and 
can be heard live on the Independent’s website, where 
most episodes average around thirty listeners. 

WNHH has a dramatically smaller audience than 
pop stations or established podcasts. But even if the 
airwaves are hard to find and online listeners tend to 
be few, the station still broadcasts content for twelve 
hours a day. The Independent’s sense of duty to telling 
New Haven’s stories, and having the right people tell 
them, pervades the entire station—it pushes the hosts 
to get behind the microphone, with people they know, 
and to simply speak, even if it’s to speak to an audience 
of a hundred, thirty, or even zero. 

“You’re listening to WNHH LP 103.5 FM New Hav­
en, streaming live at www.newhavenindependent.org,” 
says Lucy Gellman, the station manager at WNHH, 
into her microphone. She’s in the studio—a room the 
size of a walk-in closet next to the main Independent 
office—to introduce Paul Bass and produce his daily 
news show Dateline. Gellman stands behind a wooden 
desk at the back of the room, headphones covering her 
short, curly hair. There is no glass barrier between the 
talent and the technician. She uses a desktop control 
panel, stuck between her computer and keyboard, to 
fade out the music by local bands that plays before the 
show starts, and she spends most of the broadcasting 
time writing and responding to tweets or transcribing 
interviews for the Independent site. She does this for 
almost every show on WNHH, every day. On Fridays, 
she gets to be the host of Kitchen Sync, her show about 
food in New Haven. One episode was about her favor­
ite ratatouille recipe. Another discussed the city’s food 
truck laws. 

Sitting at the small linoleum table, across from Bass, 
are two WNHH regulars: State Senators Joe Markley 
and Gary Holder-Winfield, who are here to debate is­
sues from the day’s headlines. The men trade pleas­
antries first; Markley, a balding Republican with im­
pressive posture and teeth, asks Bass about the recent 
Jewish holidays. Holder-Winfield, a young Democrat 
with broad shoulders, has his hands on his knees, ready 
to spar. 

“I thought we’d lead with Planned Parenthood,” Bass 
says, referencing the rallies against defunding the or­
ganization that took place downtown on September 
29. He leans forward to rest his forearms on the table. 
There’s no script. Bass calls out the topics they’ll dis­
cuss as the clock ticks to 11:00 a.m.: the pope, John 
Boehner, state cuts to Medicaid funds, the debate 
over the name of Yale’s Calhoun College. But, first, 
Planned Parenthood.

Markley raises his eyebrows. “I’d rather talk about the 
pope than Planned Parenthood,” he hopelessly offers, 
before placing both palms flat on the table. He’s bracing 
himself. It’s 10:59 a.m. Gellman fades the music.
