"Esperanza no temorf Hope not fear!" The chant rose in the twilight as a crowd of over 2,500 filed toward the 
Yale Bowl. The group Included members of Yale unions Locals 34 and 35, the Graduate Employees and 
Students Organization, Yale-New Haven hospital workers, members of the clergy and local congregations, and 
undergraduate organizers of the nascent student union United Students at Yale-a bewildering variety of indi-
viduals and interests. They gathered on the night of Yale's tercentennial gala to demonstrate their unity of 
purpose: a desire for a better Yale, one that pays higher wages, recognizes organized graduate students, hos-
pital workers, and undergraduates, and rethinks its role in the city which surrounds it.
