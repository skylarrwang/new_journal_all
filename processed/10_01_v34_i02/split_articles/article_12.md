ON THE MORNING OF j UNE 14, 2001, 
employees of the Giordano Construction 
Company were laying water pipes in front 
of 451 College Street, one of the many con-
struction sites on the Yale campus. Entirely 
oblivious to the mystery they were about to 
unearth, several workers returned from 
their lunch breaks shordy before I PM and 
prepared to fill a trench with trucked-in 
dirt. Suddenly, they saw bone. 

A truckload of soil used for backfill 
outside of the building that now houses the 
Departments of Comparative Literature 
and Religious Studies yielded the skeletal 
remains of more than one person, includ-
ing a fractured jawbone with six teeth. 

What were these bones doing there? No 
one has found a simple answer to this sim-
ple question.
