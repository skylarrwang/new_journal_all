EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
EVERY DAY, Yale women walk over to University Health 
Services (UHs) on Hillhouse Avenue to receive some form 
of contraception-birth control pills, diaphragms, intrauterine 
devices. They are all available, and most never question their legal-
ity or women's right to have them. On their way, some of these 
women may even pass by 79 Trumbull Streeet. The building quali-
fies as a historic site, but there is no plaque commemorating what 
happened there forty years ago this November. If it weren't for 
the work of two Yale professors, one motivated woman, and mem-
bers from the Yale and New Haven c~mmunity inside this build-
ing, the women who walk to University Health Services each day 
might still be committing a crime. 


Reproductive rights in New Haven were revolutionized on 
November I, 1961, when 15 women became the inaugural patients 
of a Planned Parenthood clinic at 79 Trumbull. The clinic was an 
Â·open challenge to the Comstock laws, which made it illegal for a 
doctor in the United States to prescribe or give advice about birth 
control. In 1961, Connecticut was the only state that still clung to 
this 85-year-old law. Ten days and 75 patients later, police arrested 
the clinic's doctor, Yale obstetrics and gynecology chairman Dr. 
Charles Lee Buxton, and the clinic's director Estelle Griswold. 
Upon entering the New Haven Police Station, Buxton expressed 
regret that the clinic would have to close. "It's very disappointing 
not to be able to treat patients who need medical advice so badly," 
he said. "It's like not being able to use penicillin for anyone who 
needs it." 


Buxton and Griswold opened the clinic because the us 
Supreme Court could not rule on the constitutionality of the 
Comstock laws until someone had been prosecuted under their 
terms. Fowler Harper, the lawyer who took the case to the 
Supreme Court, said, "It would be a state and community service 
if a criminal action were brought" against the clinic. 


New Haven police alleged that both defendants "did cause or 
command a certain married woman to use a drug or medicinal 
article for the purpose of preventing conception." The pair spent 
the night in jail and was released the next day on $250 bail. 


Buxton and Griswold challenged the constitutionality of the 
Comstock laws, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against 
them. Griswold v. Conn~cticutwas on its way to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 


While their case was pending, Buxton and Griswold kept the 
clinic open, using it as the departure point for a shuttle service 
taking women to clinics in New York and Rhode Island, where 
birth control had been legalized. Four years after their arrest, on 
June 7, 1965, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in the 
defendants' favor. The 7-2 decision reversed the Comstock laws, 
making Connecticut the last state to legalize the prescription, use, 
and distribution of information about birth control. 


A
t the time of Buxton and -Griswold's arrest, the center was 
booked through mid-December, women were flocking 
there from all over Connecticut. At Grace-New Haven Hospital 
(now Yale-New Haven}, restrictions prohibited Buxton from dis-
cussing birth control with his patients. So he sent them to 
Planned Parenthood, where six other Yale doctors had agreed to 
join him in providing what they considered the best care for their 
female patients. 


Four decades later, Yale has emerged as one of the country's 
most progressive universities in terms of reproductive health poli-
cy, offering birth control and abortions under the Yale Health 
Plan. This policy appears to be a natural progression from 
Griswold v. Con~cticut. When asked in what year the Yale Health 
Plan began to fund abortions, Dr. William Billings, the head of 
obstetrics and gynecology at University Health Services at its 
inception in 1971, said, "When they became legal, in 1973. If it 
was legal, we offered it. If you wanted to have your appendix out, 
you had your appendix out. If you wanted an abortion, you could 
get an abortion." 


This past January, Yale became the first school in the nation 
to announce that it would offer the new abortion drug, RU-486, as 
part of its standard health plan. The pill, also known as Mifeprex, 
induces miscarriage within several days when administered early in 
a pregnancy. After it received FDA approval in September 2000, 
many anticipated that "the abortion pill" would fundamentally 
change the way abortions are perceived. Pro-choice activists 
praised the long-overdue expanded freedom a woman now had to 
choose from a variety of treatments. 


With the availability of a non-inva-
sive abortion procedure, women 
gained increased privacy-and control 
over their bodies. Pro-lifers, though, 
criticized the new drug's likelihood of 
increasing the number of terminated 
pregnancies. They raised doubts about the 
drug's safety, n'?ting that first-time trials 
showed that som~ women suffered from 
extensive bleedint. 


Unlike Yale", the majority of college cam-
puses in the country have steered clear of the 
controversial drug. Most choose not to offer 
Mifeprex at their health centers, claiming they 
are ill-equipped to handle the potentially severe 
side effects of the drug, while some schools, such 
as H arvard, have agreed to reimburse students 
who receive the drug from an off-campus clinic. 


When Yale announced last year that RU-486 would 
be offered as part of its standard health plan, USA Today conduct-
ed a poll of 50 random schools across -the country, of which Yale 
was the sole university co offer the controversial drug. Today, calls 
to all the Ivy League health centers reveal that Yale remains the 
only one to provide its srudents and faculty with the option of 
R.U-486. 


Without any student lobbying, Yale decided to offer a drug 
whose political implications and reported adverse side effects have 
made national headlines since its first trial in 1991. Across the 
country, op-ed pages of srudent papers have displayed headlines 
urging administrations and student health plans to provide its stu-
dents with the widest range of reproductive health options. 


Meanwhile, on Yale's campus, it was only after the administration 
announced its new policy that the debate began. 


Emily Grant, chair of the Pro-Life League at Yale, published 
op-ed pieces in srudent newspapers criticizing the decision. RU-
486, she believes, "is not designed for college women. We don't 
have husbands, mothers, and other people who live with us to 
watch over us and make sure that we 
don't bleed to death." Currently the 
Pro-Life League is pushing for Yale 
to follow Harvard's lead, and pro-
vide students with moral objections 
to abortion with a refund of the 
fraction of their student health 
insurance that pays for abortions. 
At Harvard the refund is 6o 
cents. 


Director of University 
Health Services Paul Genecin 
understands the controversy 
over the drug, especially in a 
university setting. But such 
controversy, he believes, cannot 
dictate the university's decisions. 
"Intellectual freedom at a place like Yale gives all of 
us the right to our views, but not all these views can be put into 
policy, and someone has to make this decision about policy," he 
said. Yale's policy, he feels, exists to offer the most complete set of 
medical options to patients, despite political and social implica-
tions. 


But while Buxton and Griswold opened their clinic with the 
intention of testing the law, today Yale wants no part of a political 
debate. "The issue of abortion is highly politicized," said Genecin. 
"As a health care organization, we want co preserve an atmosphere 
for our patients that is suppoctive and medical, not political." The 
result of this attitude, however, has been a notable silence about 
the options available to women under the Yale Health Plan, espe-
cially for a move that put Yale at the forefront of a national con-
flict. 


Alice Wolfram, coordinator of the Reproductive Rights 
Action League at Yale, says that the administration's uneasiness 
about politicizing women's health options "might be a legitimate 
concern, but it's not a legitimate excuse." "The larger issue," 
Wolfram asserts, "is that abortion is a safe, legal, medical proce-
dure that needs to be available to Yale students. Making abortion 
available but not telling students it is 
available has the potential to undermine 
Yale's reproductive options." 


Just how much can a woman find 
out about her choices at UHs? A 
phone call to the OB-GYN depart-
ment to inquire about students' options 
reveals that, for political or organizational 
reasons, students are not the only ones in 
the dark. "Does the Yale Health Plan 
cover Ru-486?" a student wanted to 
know. The receptionist sighed, "I'm going 
to transfer you to member services." 


Member services responded to the same 
question with a simple, "I don't know. 
Can you call back?" Calling back resulted 
in another transfer-back to OB-GYN. 
"Does the health plan cover RU-486?" 
"I don't know. I mean, I don't know 
what that is," the woman on the other 
end responded, "What is it?" 


"My friend told me that it's an abor-
tion pill." 


A slight gasp from the other end. 
Then, "Oh, dear. 1 don't know." The 
voice, which a second ago was annoyed by 
the request for the mystery drug, now 
offered$ympathy and support. Still, her 
only advice was, "Call back and make an 
appointment when you find out what you 
want to do, OK?" 


A student, confused, possibly desper-
ate, hung up the phone unaware of what 
her options were--as a UHS patient and as 
a woman. 


"I understand [Yale's] caution," says 
Susan Yq!en, Vice President of Public 
Affairs and-Communication at Planned 
Parenthood of Connecticut, "but the trou-
ble with their caution is that students may 
not be getting the information that they 
need." Yale has set itself apart from 
schools across the country, but, as Susan 
Yolen says, "I don't think anyone likes 
being on a limb all by themselves." 


In a sense, however, Yale has been in 
a league all by itself for the 40 years since 
Griswold. In his day, Griswold praised 
Buxton for having "acted in the highest 
traditions of the medical profession" and 
deserving "the salute and everlasting grati-
tude of all men and women who value 
human freedom." On July 28, 1961, 
Buxton issued a statement concerning the 
intention to open their clinic in the belief 
that Connecticut women "deserve the type
