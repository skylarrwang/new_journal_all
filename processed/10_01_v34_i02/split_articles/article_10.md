TucKED AWAY BEHI!'fD CITY HALL, on 157 
Orange Street, is an office that most people 
don't even know exists. Before September 
u, it was practically empty all day long. 
Now it has a relatively steady flow of traffic 
of five people a day. It's a small increase, but 
the people in the United States Marine 
Recruiting Office aren't interested in num-
bers. They serve those few young women 
and men who want to do more than just 
wave a flag and proclaim their patriotism. 

In fact, you won't find much flag waving in 
the Marine Recruiting Office. For them 
war is strictly business. 

Walking into a recruiting office for 
the first time is a surreal experience 
for a young, skeptical civilian. The 
floor is covered with plush 
red carpet an~ the 
walls are 
plast~red 
with Marine memo-
rabilia-glossy 
posters of tanks, 
helicopters, 
and 
sabers. Two yellow .boot 
prints appliqued onto the red carpet before 
the front desk indicate where a recruit 
should stand. As I hover near the door, to 
my left is a wall of Polaroid shots of new 
Marine recruits dressed in t-shirts and blue 
jeans. Standing in front of me is a young 
sergeant with a penetrating stare. He is pol-
ishing a dagger. The only thing at all famil-
iar is a bulldog sniffing at my ankles. Only 
this bulldog is not "Handsome Dan," but 
"Tank," the office mascot. 

The office is an elaborate propaganda 
machine, designed to entice potential 
recruits to join the Few, the Proud, the 
Marines. The man sitting behind the first 
desk is Sergeant Rosa, a lean, muscular 
young man whose eyeglasses and composed 
posrure help soften his appearance. "So, 
you ready to join?" he barks at me. 

Intimidated, I respond with a not-so defin-
itive, "Uh, no." However, after telling him 
that I am a srudent at Yale, the question of 
rny joining the Marines is immediately dis-
rnissed-the University prohibits recruiters

on its campus of Io,ooo potential soldiers, 
and students almost never express interest. 
However, Sergeant Rosa seems undisrurbed 
by this. Leaning back in his chair, he non-
chalantly remarks, "It doesn't bother me. 
I'd imagine that most Yale students aren't 
· that interested in joining the Marines. 
They're more concerned with making 
money or becoming famous." 

For Sergeant Rosa, the Marine philos-
ophy demands everything that Yalies are 
not. He takes out a set of brass plates and 
lays them on the table. They list everything 
that the Marines offers its 
recruits: Challenge, Pride 
of 
Belonging, 
Leadership 
Management Skills, 
Courage, Poise, and 
Self-confidence. 

What Yale offers 
to 
its 
stu-
dents-educa-
tiona! opportu-
nity, travel and 
adventure, professional development, and 
financial security-according to Sergeant 
Rosa are things that "come and go." 

Marines do not rely on rewards that can 
change so easily. This is why they are the 
"9u for the world," the only armed service 
that can be deployed anywhere in the 
world 
within 
24 
hours 
without 
Congressional approval. For the Marines, 
September II was just another "9u call." 

During my time in the office I hear 
Sergeant Rosa's colleagues express their dis-
satisfaction with the "bunch of fucking 
communists" surrounding them in New 
Haven and at Yale. Fortunately, as Sergeant 
Rosa is pleased to point out to a money-
grubbing Yalie such as myself, 33 percent of 
Fortune .500 companies are owned or run 
by former Marines-an impressive statistic 
for people who are taught to see financial 
security as something that "comes and 
goes." As one of Sergeant Rosa's colleagues, 
Sergeant Beaty, puts it, "Marines do many 
things with few numbers." 

But a new outburst of patriotism is 
sweeping through the country. Is the sight 
of proud Americans waving flags in sup-
port of war a welcome sign to a Marine? 
Sergeant Beaty tells me a story about a lady 
that tried to give him an American flag. He 
was in a coffee shop when she approached 
him to encourage him to put a flag on his 
car. He responded to her by pointing to the 
Department of Defense military identifica-
tion sticker on his truck. "I was letting her 
know that I had been wearing my flag with 
pride long before September 11." He stared 
down at me. "On September 10 we could-
n't give anyone a flag without someone· 
spitting on it or burning it. Now everyone 
fucking wants one."
