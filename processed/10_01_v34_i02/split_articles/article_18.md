"THE OUTBREAK OF [THE WAR] 
FOUND THE 
UNPREPARED AND THE COLLEGE STUDENTS 
AND IGNORANT • •• THE MAJORITY, EITHER LUKEWARM OR 
INDIFFERENT, REMAINED MERELY SPECTATORS THROUGH-
OUT THE ENTI RE CONFLICT." 
These words could easily refer to this month's bombing of 
Afghanistan. But they are taken from Ellsworth Eliot's 1932 history 
Yak in the Civil war. I find the echo fascinating, as the last month 
of national uncertainty has led me to a search for historical context. 
How should we, as studentS, address war from within an institution 
older than the nation itself? 

The answers I found were surprisingly enduring. In every 
major American war, Yale has been faced with an existential chal-
lenge: How can it continue to prepare elite young men for the 
future through a liberal arts education when that future is endan-
gered and those young men are needed to fight? Throughout us his-
tory, the University has adapted to the requirementS of the time, 
defending both irs values and its methods as crucial to the nation's 
best interests. "In general, war has strengthened the University's 
confidence in itself;'' said Gaddis Smith, professor emeritus and 
eminent historian ofYale. 

Furthermore, Yale and irs studentS have always responded to 
war with an eye toward building both the nation's history and their 
own futures. The names carved into the marble walls of Woolsey 
Hall bespeak the university's pride in its contribution to the nation-
al destiny. But as time passes, we may look very differently at both 
self-anointed heroes and the many in every age who allowed histo-
ry to pass them by. 

T
he War Between the Scates was the first to affect Yale sub-
stantially. During the American Revolution, the college, with 
only about 6o studentS, simply dosed down for a year. The War of 
1812 and the Mexican War barely hindered Yale's growth or estab-
lishment. When news of war came to Yale during spring break in 
1860, therefore, it reached a student body that had, like the current 
one, grown up in peaceful and prosperous times. They were uncon-
16 
cerned with policies. Eliot pointS out that during the'entire ten years 
prior to the war, only one essay on any political subject appeared in 
any student publication. 

One immediate effect of the Civil War was the departure of 
Southern studentS. But what ofYale's brave young Northern sons? 
Were their heartS filled with fire for the glorious conflict? Not so 
much. Neither faculty nor administration especially encouraged 
service in the war, according to Eliot. In fact, the faculty decided 
against allowing a leave of absence for those deciding to serve. All 
in all, only about eleven percent of the class. of 1865 saw action, 
including 17 who served over their summer break. Out of all of 
Yale's studentS and living alumni of the time, 932 or one-fifth 
fought in the war-775 Union and 157 Confederate. 

On campus, the attitude toward the war was surprisingly flip-
pant. In essays such as "My War Experience" and "Our Army 
Correspondence," appearing in the Yak Literary Magazine in 1862, 
war service sounded like a bad vacation. One student wrote from 
the Shenandoah Valley: "The only thing we rook at this point were 
stout colds ... New Haven fogs don't get anything like what we cap· 
cured in Philadelphia, where we held a severe struggle with numer-
ous ditches and brambles." 

Of course there were heroic stories as well, like that of James 
Brand in the History of the Class of I865. "In the thick of the fight-
ing at Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville & Gettysburg. Carried his 
wounded colonel off the "Wheat Field" in the face of a galling fire. 
For this act, Congress awarded him a gold medal." On his return to 
New Haven in the spring, "Professor Thacher is said to have 
mounted the fence and proposed 'three cheers for James Brand."' 

But the average student distinctly lacked brio. William 
Stocking, class of x865, quips in Yak in the Civil war, "We thought 
the war was about over or we wouldn't have enlisted at all." He

recounts a long :1maginary conversation with a fellow soldier who 
sounds like a Viemam protester-he "had been drafted and he had-
n't money to buy a substitute; the roads to Canady was all guarded; 
he would have to go to the front; he might get killed and then what 
would become of him?" The soldier ends by lamenting char he was-
n't a sick, black, b,;lby girl, "For then I would surely never have to 
serve." 

A more thoughtful attempt to rationalize studenrs' lack of par-
ticipation was the essay, "In WarTime," published in the Lit in June 
1864. Ir follows the average student's hemming and hawing between 
the campus "contagion of enthusiasm" and his family's worry. 
The Yale man tells himself that the war ought to be fought by the 
lower classes: "There were other men who were stouter, men who 
had no employment, and no settled plans, there were enough of 
these men to ftli up the ranks on the first call, and probably they 
would ftnish the war." As the war drags on, and the carnage gets 
worse, he feels not reliefbut regret."Vicksburg, Gettysburg, are his-
torical names, but you have no share in them ... others chide your 
alma mater for having kept so many of her sons at home." Sharing 
in "historical" glory, even if that meant death, should be part of the 
Yale spirit. 

The essay concludes with a theme repeated again and again 
over the next century: Yale men could be great in war, but their tal-
enrs are better served by shaping history in peace. In this case, an 
appeal is made to studentS to go south as carpetbaggers: "There is a 
whole race to be elevated." And this wasn't just rhetoric. Smith 
points out Yale's strong role in the establishment of black colleges 
after Reconstruction; in the 188os there was a higher enrollment of 
blacksrudenrs at Yale than at any time until the 196os, mostly trans-
fer studentS from colleges like Fisk with Yale graduates on their fac-
ulties. 

OCTOBER 19, 2001 

he History of the Class o/1918 includes an essay on "Yale in the 
Civil War and Yale in the World War" by Yale Law Professor 
Simeon E. Baldwin, class of r861. He goes through the relatively 
paltry statistics of those from Yale who served in his youth before 
concluding, "These figures are in striking contrast to those which 
the next university catalogue will describe. The college is now half 
depleted, dining hall dosed, and the campus is a daily drill ground. 
StudentS go about in Khaki and the only lectures or addresses which 
attract any interest are on the war." 

Indeed, the degree to which Yale turned all irs resources toward 
war in both WW1 and WWII is hard ro imagine today. "We were a 
very militaristic college," says Smith, "much more militaristic than 
Harvard. We were the only one that had irs own military program 
during the neutrality period." Prior to the establishment of the 
national Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) in 1916, Yale signed 
up 500 students for training in field artiliery maneuvers. Private 
donations built a drill hall and stables out on the Yale Field, and 
each Yale Battery drilled an hour-and-a-half a week. In the summer 
of 1916 a company of 120 srudenrs, including Prescott Bush and 
Hiram Bingham, the future discoverer of Machu Picchu, went to 
training camp at Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, and spent a wonderful 
vacation learning to swear and dig ditches. 

Even before America entered the war, sons of Eli were in the 
trenches. Most famously, Karl Llewellyn, an American who had 
attended high school in Germany, joined the German forces as soon 
as war broke out. As he wrote to his class, "I believe that Germany 
has been forced into this conflict through no fault of her own ... I 
shall be in the greatest epoch of the century. I shal! see history made, 
and see it in Germany, with an understanding that few have had." 
He received the Iron Cross before being removed from Germany 
through the intercession of the American ambassador, and returned

to Yale in time co graduate with his class. He later tried in vain to 
join the American army, and went on to become a tegendary pro-
fessor of law. Junior Will Thaw enlisted in the French army in 1915. 
He wrote: "I am going to take a part, however small, in the great-
est, and probably last, war in history, which has apparently devel-
oped into a fight of civilization against barbarism." 

Once war was declared, again during spring break, "Yale 
became a military camp," says Smith. The dorms were under mili-
tary supervision, Old Campus and Cross Campus were guarded by 
sentries, and nearly the entire student body was enrolled in the 
ROTC training course. The Class of 1917 published a separate war 
R~cord along with its History, the only Yale class to do so. Three 
hundred and sixry-four out of 415 students have some service record 
listed. These range from the bombers of the flying "Yale Gang" to 
artillery officers to members of the Chinese Labor Corps of the 
British Expeditionary Forces. 

What spurred Yale's eagerness for war? Football, according to 
Professor Smith. "It had quite a bit co do with what was then called 
the Yale spirit, which has quite a bit to do with football," he said. 
"Players were heroes who sacrificed time and pain for the greater 
glory of Yale . . . Yale invented college football as we know it." 

Throughout the First World War, victories over Princeton and 
Brown shared space with victories at Berne or the Somme on the 
front pages of the News. The class of 1917 put it this way: 
18 
All throughout the year we had been growing in our class 
a certain spirit best typified in our College motto, 'For 
God, for Country, and for Yale', which in June was des-
tined to manifest itself in a practical way and amply prove 
the justification of its existence. It was the spirit of mili-
tarism, preparedness, and service. 

This view was echoed in the boosterism of President Hadley, 
who, according to Smith, went so far as co state at the dedication of 
Woolsey Hall in 1919, '"these honored dead have fulfilled the ulti-
mate purpose of the university by dying'." 

Not everyone was thrilled by the prospect of drill teams shar-
ing the Yale fields with football scrimmages. The discussion of the 
formation of Yale Batteries included a letter co the News from stu-
dent G.R. Cl!cler on October 5, 1915. "The military regime must 
inevitably have a vicious effect on the intellectual ideals, on the 
thinking of every man in college," Curler wrote. "Worst of all, we 
should be caught to think of organized murder as a sort of game, on 
the whole rather good sport." 

Whatever the objections of students like Cutler or the odd 
pacifist professor like William Lyons Phelps, Yale forged lasting 
links with the military during World War I. Yale's rotc program 
would continue, with for-credit courses in "military science"-
"how to dig a latrine," according to Smith-until widespread oppo-
sition to the Vietnam War led to the program's abandonment in 
1969. 

HE WORLD'S SECOND "TOTAL WAll." BROUGHT a greater degree 
of militarization a,nd upheaval to the University than had yet 
been seen. In July 1941 students lost their blanket deferment from 
the dra& for the first time. As in World War I, the campus became 
a military camp. This time several different wings of the military set 
up on campus: the Enlisted Reserve Corps, Navy· Line and Air, 
Marines, Aimy Air Corps, and the Aimy. Most trainees were not 
drafted, but in February and March 1943 Yale Goo students were 
called up in rwo weeks. The campus was in mass confusion, with 
studentS packing and unpacking, holding multiple "liquid" good-
bye parties, auditing their classes restlessly. 

As the war intensified, President Seymour instituted major 
changes in Yale's curriculum and policies. He wrote co the Class of 
1944: "In defense against aggressive powers whose success will mean 
the destruction of all freedoms without which education is mean-
ingless, the University must devote herself without limit of effort to 
a single, special service--helping to win the War. To this end all the 
resources of Yale are pledged." Yale moved to a year-round schedule 
and the traditional curriculum was curtailed co allow students to 
graduate in seven semesters while simultaneously training for the 
military. 

Professor Smith says that in contrast co the bombastic rhetoric 
of wwt, the Second World War brought a grimmer attitude to the 
Universiry. As the History of th~ Class of I944 reads: "No one could 
say that our new way of life was as enjoyable as the old, or that all 
our lase days here have been pleasant." But the students go on co 
underline their own necessity to history in terms familiar from pre-
vious generations of Yale students. "· ... that these changes were nee-
