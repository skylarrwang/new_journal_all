the ASA and the YPJ about Palestine," he

it possible? Probably. But it hasn't hap-

A
TH£ PARTY IS DYING DOWN at the 
cultural house, Gardezi and I end 
up on the porch, talking about 
how Yale has changed since September n. 
A junior who speaks with self-assurance, 
Gardezi is caught off guard when asked if 
she has always felt safe here. Her breath 
quickens a moment as she pauses. 
Collecting herself, she admits that she has 
felt like an outsider at times. "It's ironic," 
she says, speaking of the post-catastrophe 
atmosphere on campus. "I only really start-
ed to feel safe and comfortable this last 
y.:ar. I didn't feel self-conscious anymore. I 
didn't feel like I was this person draped in 
this cloth and people were staring at me." 
That newfound security was shattered 
when news of the attacks came. "I have a 
brother who works in New York," Gardezi 
says. "But I felt like I couldn't react. I had 
10 wear this stone expression on my face, 
because people automatically see the head 
covering and they want to read your face. 
'What does it mean? Is she happy?'" 
Gardezi describes a feeling common 
among many Arab and Muslim students: 
that their otherness is now seen as a threat. 
•Honest to God, I don't know what people 
think when they see me, and I'm not going 
0cro&£R 19, 2001 
to go that far in speculating," she says. 
Tammer Riad expresses a similar frustra-
tion. Speaking of the Arab and Muslim 
communities as a whole, he says he feels as 
if "we have to come together and prove to 
the American public that we grieve as 
much as they do, if not more. You know, 
we're American too." 

While some students stay silent in an 
attempt to prove their patriotism, others 
believe it is important to speak freely. 
Gardezi, for instance, expresses concern 
about the future of Afghanistan, the home-
land she hasn't seen since age three. "What 
are we going to do, bomb the countryside? 
The people there are already dying. Theyre 
already starVing ... It just doesn't make 
sense." Describing an identity that some 
might interpret as contradictory, she con-
tinues, "At my core, I'm still an Afghan-
an Afghan-American . . . I'm just as 
American as anyone else, and if I have to 
prove it to someone, well, I don't need to 
concern myself with them." 

GA.RDEZI HEADS BACK JNSIO£ tO 
the party, a bicyclist pedals past 
on Crown Street. "usA! uSA!" he 
shouts in the direction of the house. A 
week before, I would have thought such an 
outburst bizarre. Now I think it seems nor-
mal enough, even admirable. Then, I begin 
to consider his intentions and to wonder 
who he was. A patriotic Yalie? Looked like 
it. A friend of mine? Could have been. A 
bigot? Perhaps. I walk home alone, won-
dering how it came to be that the three pos-
sibilities could so easily all be true.
