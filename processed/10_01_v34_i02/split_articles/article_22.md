cian, but he remained mentally ill and

weekly chess games at Harmony Place, but 
that was because my opponents were usual-
ly high on crack. 

Last summer, I did not know what to 
do. I didn't want to move again, so I ended 
up in New Haven, figuring I could work 
for one of its hundreds of do-gooder orga-
nizations. But when June came, I was still 
floating and unsatisfied., 

Then, I had a number of long conver-
sations with a friend who was working on 
the "DeStefano for Mayor" campaign, and 
I watched the ftcst debate between mayoral 
ical leadership in Fair Haven because they 
had been consistently frustrated at the apa-
thy and incompetence of the existing lead-
ers. In Fair Haven, which comprises three 
of New Haven's 30 political wards (wards 
14> 15, and 16) and q,ooo of its 120,000 res-
idents, democracy seemed to be failing. 
The three Fair Haven aldermen had been 
in power for a decade, and we believed they 
had done harm. Their unchallenged leader-
ship was perpetuated by a lack of effort to 
register new voters in the part of the city 
that consistently attracts the largest num-
ber of new residents. They supported the 
reopening of an antiquated power plant in

trash collection operation to keep Fair 
Haven clean. All kinds of other leaders, 
activists, and community members came 
forward during the Fair Haven campaign, 
united in their conviction that Fair Haven's 
people deserved better. The three aldermen 
remain the same, but the Fair Haven 
Democratic Party is radically different. 

There were no limits last summer. 
Anyone could ask for anything, especially 
when they asked together.

candidates DeStefano and State Senator 
Martin Looney. I began working on the 
campaign afrer a long conversation with 
Campaign Manager Julio Gonzalez, who 
reminded me that the "DeStefano for 
Mayor" campaign was not a tutoring pro-
gram or a community development corpo-
ration. "It's a political campaign, and the 
goal is to win," he told me. "We want to 
win for good reasons. But we are not a non-
profit. Are you sure this is what you want 
to do?" 

I was not sure. I spent hours that night 
thinking a.bout whether power really cor-
rupts, and anticipating all the dirty, dis-
tasteful things I would see happen through-
out the summer. I never guessed that I 
would be spending my Thursday nights in 
July 
in 
the 
yellow-walled 
People's 
laundromat. 

At first, I couldn't conceive of any-
thing revolutionary about the reelection of 
a four-term mayor. But then I realized one 
of the major goals of the campaign was to 
change the Democratic Party in New 
Haven by reaching out to everyone. Several 
of the Mayor's supporters were determined 
to find and support new Democratic polit-

their neighborhood, English Station, even 
though New Haven already has the highest 
rate of childhood asthma in the state of 
Connecticut. Prostitution and drug-deal-
ing remain prevalent in many sections of 
Fair Haven. Yet all three of its representa-
tives have voted against allocating resources 
to Fair Haven when they cannot directly 
contrOl them. 

There had not been a serious challenge 
to the aldermanic seats in Fair Haven for . 
longer than most residents could remem-
ber. The "DeStefano for Mayor" campaign 
ran candidates against the three incum-
bents. All three lost, but our campaign reg-
istered and pulled 300 new Democratic 
voters in Fair Haven, uniting passionate 
people from different pans of Fair Haven 
as well as creating votes for DeStefano. For 
the first time in years, people were talkin.g 
about issues, about change, about the 
future. The voting rolls were growing. A 
serious, impassioned debate developed. 
More people in Fair Haven voted than in 
any of the past four mayoral primaries.

least one of the issues, even though our 
candidates did not win. When I wrote an 
"Energy Plan" for New Haven for the cam-
paign this summer, one of my suggestions 
was that the city should acquire English 
Station, to make sure that it can never 
reopen in a way that is destructive to the 
people near it. I just found out that the city 
is actually working to do this. The alder-
men retracted their unanimous support of 
the reopening of the English Station power 
plant and even apologized for ever support-
ing it. This means that the people of Fair 
Haven can count on at least one line of 
defense against environmental racism. 

This summer I never wanted to leave 
work. Sometimes I didn't. I spent more 
than a few nights under my desk at the 
office. For the first time, I felt like I was 
doing more than fostering dependency. I 
was a part of the fluid organism that is 
democracy-something that can be as rad-
ical, daring, and open as people are willing 
to make it.
