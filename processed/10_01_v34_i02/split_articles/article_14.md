ON OcrOBER 5-7, 2001, Yale welcomed 
back its alumni to a third tercentennial 
weekend. Though special attempts were 
made to involve current students, senti-
ments on campus ranged from uninterest-
ed to indifferent. But I, an eager freshman, 
decided not to be cynical; in fact, inspired 
by a surge of school spirit, I christened 
myself "Tercentennial Boy" and dedicated 
my soul to Yale's birthday. Engulfed in a sea 
of black Mercedes sedans and joined by a 
swarm of silver-haired men, I made it my 
mission to get to the bottom of ail things 
"three hundred." Was there anything 
beneath the hoopla? Was the gala more 
than a self-congratulatory reunion? 

The weekend opened Friday evening 
with "A Celebration Of Tradition and 
Service" outside the Bowl. More than 20 
organizations, 15 academic departments 
and schools, and beleaguered sports teams 
like fencing were invited to flaunt their 
achievements under makeshift tents. I 
arrived rwo hours before the start of the 
show, hoping to rub should.ers with 
throngs of other eager Yalies, but I found 
only nine people there including personnel. 
Needing to pass some time, I dragged rwo 
suitemates onto the basketball court where 
I found a charming Southern alumnus of 
the class of 1959 in a ragged pinstriped suit 
old enough to have been worn by James 
Naismith. I asked him if he wanted to play. 
He nodded in assent, and then the two of 
us took on my suitemates. Despite his 
advanced age, he knew how to talk shit and 
had a beautifully old-school sky-hook. I 
threw him a couple of passes he might have 
slammed down were it still 1959, but he fin-
ger-rolled them in. After the old man and I 
finished routing my friends, I asked him 
about the Yale of his day. "Not going to 
school with women was a problem ... it led 
to nothing good, because I honestly didn't 
know how to interact with them. None of 
us knew how." As we walked off the court, 
I saw his wife waiting for him. Apparently 
he had learned. The crowds now began to 
overflow Eli Village. It was Tercentennial 
Time. 

I took in the scenery in all its 
grandeur: old people, older people, and 
confused students who looked as though 
they had arrived at the party thirty years 
earlier. As I passed an intriguing exhibit on 
robotics, I saw a faculty jazz band headed 
by a chiseled, So-year-old tuba player. 
They were playing an upbeat Dixieland 
tune and the crowd was very into them. 
These guys, whose skill paralleled their 
age, redefined cool; for a moment, I 
would have given up youth itself to 
become one of them. This urge only 
intensified as the saxophonist, sporting 
a slick 50s Vegas look, slyly winked at a 
mesmerized (not to mention beautiful) 
sophomore. He represented an antique-
ly sophisticated generation ofYale men 
who wore raccoon coats and drank brandy. 
I wanted in on that world, and they want-
ed to go back to it .. 

As hot as the band was, the buzz for 
me had shifted to a dark corner behind a 
gigantic plastic balloon in the likeness of a 
Tostitos bag. A crowd surrounded a myste-
rious, towering figure accompanied by 
what he claimed was a bulldog. Now I'm 
no dog breeder, but I know 'a }?ulldog when 
I see one, and this was more like an ugly, 
enormous, vicious Chihuahua. Little kids 
tried to play with the thing, and its owner 
encouraged them: "Pet Bulldog, Bulldog 
loves you." The cute kids begged to differ, 
giggling in unison, "That's not a bulldog!" 
Despite ethical reservations about interact-
ing with a person who desecrates our mas-
cot and 
dupes our community, 
I 
approached the character because he radiat-
ed a kind of familiar avuncular vibe. He 
said to me, "I declare this day a divine spec-
tacle." As into the whole thing as I was, I 
replied, "Yeah, it's fun, but you might be 
slightly overdoing it." The guy immediate-
ly turned on me, clutched his dog leash, 
and gave me a look that said, "If you don't 
get lost I'm gonna sick this bitch on you so 
fast you won't know what hit you, you lit-
de smartass." Kids were frightened, the 
crowd began to dissipate, and needless to 
say, I boned ~ut. 

I checked my cell. It was time to enter 
the stadium. I took my seat in the center of 
the Davenport section only to find some-
thing I hadn't seen for hours: throngs of 
young people. I started a conversation with 
the girl next to me, but it all seemed so rou-
tine; I missed the mystique of the old-
timers. 

The show in thcf Bowl, entitled "For 
God, for Country, for Yale ... Forever" lived 
up to its name in that it lasted approxi-
mately forever; but it was still studded with 
a few gems. The rumor all along had been 
that Britney Spears would make a cameo, 
but we got something far more special: Big 
Bird. Not only did the gentle giant engage 
in witty banter with William F. Buckley, Jr., 
but he led the crowd in a heartwarming 
rendition of the Sesame Street song. The 
Bowl erupted in applause as we all 
regressed 15 or more years. It all seemed too 
good to be true and this Â·was still before 
Paul Simon took center stage. When he 
went into "Graceland" and "Bridge Over 
Troubled Water," the girl next to me called 
her dad in New York and simply said, 
"Listen." It was quite a moment. All this, in 
addition to a prc;: .. Tecorded greeting from 
the 41st president, constant name drop-
ping, and way too much orchestral music, 
lefr me with one question: What more 
could you ask for? This was an event that at 
different times resembled a second-tier 
awards show, a tight concert, and (most 
often) a ridiculously lavish bat mitzvah. 

The night climaxed with an intimidat-
ing fireworks display. After the finale, I 
stood up, collected myself, and looked 
down at the flock of alumni on the field. I 
saw men and women who were, well, very 
old. And then it hit me. Before I know it, I 
will be the alumnus, blue blazer and all.
