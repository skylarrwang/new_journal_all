The bones, according to the state's 
medical examiner, are from roo to 150 years 
old. The New Haven Register suggested that 
they carne from a church burial ground, 
maybe the First & Summerfield United 
Methodist Church'~ a few houses away. 

However, such a simple explanation is 
highly unlikely, says Ed Franquemont, 
executive director of the New H aven 
Preservation Trust. "According to my 
knowledge, there never was a cemetery 
associated with this church." 

Yale's chief research archivist Judith 
Schiff offers an altogether different 
explanation. 
Describing 
the 
dis-
covery as 
"puzzling," 
she 
posits 
that 
these 
bones were the 
remains of people 
who were privately 
buried-perhap~ an 
old professor. ~hose 
relatives wished him to 
remain nearby. According to the 
New Haven Colony Historical Society 
records, in the nineteenth century the land 
on College Street was owned by several 
prominent figures, including a dentist, a 
public official, and a minister, any of whom 
may have wished to keep their loved ones 
close at hand. However, as Franquemont 
points out, there were rules prohibiting pri-
vate burials; thus, such a suggestion seems 
only "dimly possible." So could it have 
been foul play? Perhaps these human 
remains are the clue to the so-called 
'Edwards tragedy of 1906,' a mysterious 
murder that took place in the home of one 
of the neighborhood residents. Indeed, as 
Schiff points out, in this case "anything's 
possible." 

Yet we should not forget a crucial part 
of the medical examiner's report-the find-
ing of surgical marks on many of the bones. 
According co a Yale spokesman who asked 
not to be named, the medical examiner 
believes the bones to have come from dis-
carded cadavers used for medical purposes 
when the comer of Prospect and Grove 
Streets was the site of the School of 
Medicine from 1813 to r86o. While medical 
research was uncommon during the early 
nineteenth century, cadavers were neces-
sary for teaching basic anatomy. However, 
since "recent subjects" were hard to come 
by, rumors were rife about students sneak-
ing into the Grove Street Cemetery ro steal 
bodies for classroom use. It was even 
thought that a tunnel connected the ceme-
tery to the medical school to make the stu-
dents' snatching a little easier. Although 
these macabre stories are hard to ver-
ify, the medical school's his-
torical 
librarian Tobey 
Appel acknowledges bod-
ies must have been pro-
cured in a "somewhat 
shady manner." She 
refers to an incident 
in 1824 when a 
riot broke out in 
New 
Haven 
after 
rumor that 
students 
had taken a 
female body 
from 
Haven ceme-
tery proved to be true. Enraged 
townspeople besieged the building for five 
nights; only an armed intervention by the 
local militia was able to quell the crowd's 
anger. The medical school was forced to 
rebury the stolen cadaver. 

With medical markings on the bones 
and fragments revealing evidence of the 
scalpel or bone saw, it is quite possible thar 
the medical examiner's supposition holds 
true. In fact, the backfill the construction 
crew was using may have originated from 
behind the current sss building, since fill 
from various work sites is moved around 
campus regularly to be used wherever nec-
essary. As a result, however, the exact source 
of the din in which the bones were found 
may never be determined. As one local 
newspaper so aptly commented about the 
'EdwardS tragedy' in 1906, "This mystery, 
it is safe to say, never will be cleared up sat-
isfactorily unless the dead will come back 
to tell."

**Whipping Boys**
**Author: Katie Malizia**

IN 1865, freshman Lyman Hotchkiss Bagg 
might have returned to his room after a 
long day of orientation exercises to find his 
favorite cap missing, or his boxing gloves, 
or perhaps his pipe and tobacco. He looks 
around, confused. Suddenly, there is a 
knock at the door. "Yes?" answers the per-
plexed Bagg. From the other side comes 
laughter and cries of "Open the door, 
Fresh!" and "Let us in, Freshie, if you don't 
want to die!" A crowd of rowdy and inebri-
ated sophomores bursts into the room and 
orders him to climb on his desk. If he refus-
es, they place him there by force, binding 
him if necessary. Having subdued their 
prey, they pull cigars and pipes from their 
pockets and proceed to blow smoke in his 
face, all the while ordering him co recite 
poetry in Greek, explain the principles of 
Euclid, say the alphabet backwards, sing 
Yale songs, or dance a jig. 

This is just one of the bizarre hazing 
rituals Bagg himself describes in his book 
Four Years at Yale, published in 1871. The 
book was part of a Yale tradition in which 
each class would write its own history 
shortly after graduation. According ro 
Bagg, upperclassmen in general, and 
sophomores in particular, considered it 
their sacred duty to torment freshmen 
without mercy, doing everything from 
breaking into their rooms and stealing their 
personal belongings to shoving them into 
the street as they passed on the sidewalk. 
The harassment was so vicious that Bagg 
openly encouraged freshmen to take up 
arms against their oppressors: "With suffi-
cient warning, on both sides," he claimed, 
"a pistol-shot through the door is the surest 
way to scatter a crowd of Sophs pressing 
against it, and though they vow dire 
vengeance against him in consequence, a 
Freshman who thus defends himself will 
not be likely afrerwards to suffer at their 
hands." However, he is quick to point out, 
brandishing a pistol at the perpetrators 
once they have entered the room is just 
"sheer folly." 

The old boys ofYale also took a more 
literal approach to the tradition of"Rush." 
On an appointed night, usually in response 
to a challenge from the sophomores, 
crowds of "Freshes" anti "Sophs" would 
gather at opposite ends of Library Walk to 
battle it out for the sake of class honor. At 
a given signal they would rush the oppos-
ing class at a dead sprint determined to 
break the other's ranks, though it mean 
scratched faces, scraped knees, and torn 
clothes. Rush usually continued in this way 
until the faculty sent everyone back to their 
lodgings or the police started making 
arrests. 

But none of this, Bagg insists, com-
pares to the genuine "hazing" reserved for 
special cases of freshmen insolence. If a 
freshman was deemed particularly ornery 
or uncooperative, a "self-appointed 
committee" of sophomores lured him 
into a closed carriage where he was 
bound, gagged, and blindfolded. They 
would then drive off with their victim to 
some remote location, often East or 
West Rock, where, depending on how 
much they disliked the offending Frosh, 
they would cut his hair, write his class 
year on his cheek in indelible ink, 
drench him in cold water, strip him 
naked and smear his body with paint, or 
as Bagg puts it, "practice certain things 
which cannot be mentioned ... When. they 
tired of this they left him, hog-tied and 
naked, to make his own way home. If he 
was especially lucky, they might toss him 
over the wall of Grove Street Cemetery, 
where he stayed until the gates were 
unlocked the next morning. 

Interestingly, Bagg traces the abuse of 
freshmen back to Yale undergraduate regu-
lations. As late as 1804, Yale freshmen were 
apprenticed to serve upperclassmen, who 
could summon them any time during their 
free hours. "It being the duty of Seniors," 
according to the 1760 rulebook, "to teach 
Freshmen the laws, usages and customs of 
the College, to this end they are empow-
ered to order the whole freshmen class, or 
any member of it, to appear, in order to be 
instructed and reproved, at such a time and 
place as they shall appoint; when and 
where every freshman shall attend, answer 
all proper questions, and behave decently." 

Anyone want a freshman slave? 

The cruelest of these practices have 
mercifully receded into the past, and Bagg 
admits that, despite the abuse, "It is the 
freshmen," he says, "who go to the greatest 
excess in all sort of indulgences" from 
"drunkenness" to "lechery." At least some 
things never change.
