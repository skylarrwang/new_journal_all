In 1919, Igor Sikorsky fled the Russian Revolution for New York. Four years later, he founded the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation and went on to design and build the world's first helicopter. He designed them to be maneuverable for improved search and rescue. "If a man is in need of rescue, an airplane can come in and throw flowers on him, and that's just about all." Today, Sikorsky is best known for combat aircraft, but its website still touts stories


In the current conflict, Black Hawks play a central role in US military strategy. Afghanistan's mountainous terrain makes helicopters the combat vehicle of choice. America has already moved Black Hawk helicopters into neighboring Uzbekistan, and the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk is now stationed in nearby waters to be used as a "my pad" for helicopter landings and special operations. While United Technologies Co. (UTC), Sikorsky's parent company, saw its stock plummet after September 11, chairman George David believes that defense spending will pull them through once again.


Without extensive US training, Colombia seems unable to properly manage the new helicopters it has received as part of the War on Drugs. Last February, former drug czar Barry McCaffrey said, "You can't just send machinery ... You've got to train the crews ... (Several years ago) I flew in there and looked at (the Colombians) painting over the near $100,000-plus-radar-reflective paint job so they could get 'Ejercito de Colombia' on the tailbone."


In the 1980s, Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd was known for his vocal opposition to President Reagan's interventionist policies in Central America, especially with regard to Nicaragua. However, he voted in favor of Plan Colombia last year. UTC has donated at least $38,000 to Senator Dodd and $33,500 to Senator Joseph Lieberman in the last six years.


Meanwhile, after signing a $217 million multi-year defense contract last May, Sikorsky has hired new workers in Connecticut. UTC is the state's largest employer; Sikorsky alone is the tenth largest.


Last year, Congress gave $297 million to Colombia for new military expenditures in the War on Drugs. This will include the purchase of at least 18 new Sikorsky Black Hawks. Not mentioned on the Sikorsky website is the use of its helicopters in Colombia's 40-year-old civil war. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Rand Beers has said, "The governments of Colombia and the United States don't discriminate between who is the drug trafficker and the ..."


Next March, Sony Pictures will release *Black Hawk Down*, a patriotic action flick about a crashed helicopter in Somalia and the values Americans hold most dear. In *Deeds*, another upcoming film, Sikorsky's S-92 is the stylish ride of a big-time businessman. According to the Sikorsky website, "There is an old Hollywood adage that actors should not share a stage with animals and children, as they are certain to steal the scene. Add to that a Sikorsky helicopter."
