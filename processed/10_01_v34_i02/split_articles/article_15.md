T'S FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 
2001. Members of the Asian 
American Students Alliance, 
the Association of Native Americans 
at 
~Yale, 
the 
Arab 
Students 
Association 
(ASA), 
Muslim 
Students Association (MSA), and others 
have gathered at one of Yale's cultural 
houses. Many here were at an interfaith 
vigil earlier in the day sponsored by the 
MSA and Yale Hillel. Jews had read from 
the Koran, Muslims from the Old 
Testament prophets; everyone prayed-
together-for peace. In the face of 
tragedy, Yale students look first to one 
another for consolation and support. 
That night at the house, they were doing 
what students everywhere were doing: ban-
tering nervously over strains of hip-hop and 
rock, trying again to relax and to laugh, 
doing anything but studying, anything but 
watching TY. 

The scene could have been lifted from the 
pages of Yale's promotional literature. I imagine 
a caption beneath the. photograph: At Yak you 
will ga th~ b~st ~ducation available anywh"~· lOu 
will b~ in th~ vibrantly div~~ company of your purs, 
th~ group who will probably teach you th~ most in your 
four y~ars of study. Th~ campus is a gartkn of tokranc~ 
wh~ any stutknt may gath" th~ flowers of a /ib"al 
~ducation fruly during an untkrgraduau ca"" 
that com~s to sum iik~ one long_ stimulating 
conversation. 

Yale's Muslim and Arab students find 
tolerance more preached than practiced 
"I'm very lucky to be at Yale. It's a very open-minded atmos-
phere," Tammer Riad, an Egyptian-American from New Jersey, told 
me that night. Nilofar Gardezi, an Mghan-American from 
California, concured: She's not felt any sidelong glances or heard 
any negative comments. "And I'm not surprised," she says "because 
I feel the Yale community is very open." 

I listen and nod, but in my mind I imagine that caption with 
another sentence penciled in after September n: This could be the 
biggest lie you've ever believed. 

E
VERYONR AT THE HOUSE had been told time and again that 
Yale was safe. Still, they told each other one more time. 
Some displaced their concerns, focusing on the now con-
tinuous stream of news stories 
reporting acts of liacred and calls 
for retaliation ·against Arabs, 
other Middle-Easterners, Asians, 
Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, and 
others 
across 
country. 
~Muhajaba, watch out.'ll 
~If you look Arab, be careful.' 
Someone's friend's ' mosque was firebombed outside Chicago. 
Someone else's parents were told to go back where they belong. 
Another person describes a bed-sheet sign spotted by a friend in 
New Jersey: Muslim Hunting Season Now Open. 

Sammy Mansour, a Palestinian Muslim from Tira, Israel, who 
holds both American and Israeli citizenship, brings up the vandal-
izing of an MSA building at Wayne State University in Detroit: 
Bricks were thrown through windows; cars were smashed. All agree 
that such an incident could never happen here. 

Yet Mansour himself admits, "There's always a threat in the 
background." Referring to an escort list created for ASA and MSA 
members, he says, "We're just taking precautionary measures." But 
others bring up incidents occurring in town, not far from campus: 
people threatened, singled out for their race or creed. "You never 
know," Mansour says. "It could eventually spill over onto campus. 
But so far it hasn't." 

Gardezi, however, has a story to counter that. She describes a 
joint ASA-MSA meeting held the night after the attacks. A friend, she 
says, saw from a distance a woman in a headscarf walking down a 
COrridor in WiUiam L. Harkness Hall. She then overheard voices 
fiom a nearby classroom: "How dare she wear that? How dare she 
show her face at a time like this?" "We all collectively gasped," 
Gardezi says of the reaction by those at the meeting that night. 
"'This could have been me. There are only four of us here on the 
whole campus who are muhajaba {Muslim women who wear the 
hijab, a traditional headscarf)." "That was the first incident we had 
heard of ... and we didn't know what to anticipate. We were going 
around the circle, and time and time again someone kept saying 
'Muhajaba, watch out.' 'If you look Arab, be careful.'" 

Fadi Kanaan, co-president of the ASA, who is a Lebanese citi-
zen, describes "a wall of bitterness" dividing campus since 
September n. One wonders if the barrier he describes is noticed 
only by those whom it excludes. Kanaan gives the atmosphere in the 
Yale office where he works as an example of the change: "Just the 
fact that you are racially affiliated with a group of people--not even 
religiously or politically--can make people think that you feel dif-
ferently about this whole situation." He tries to understand his co-
workers' attitudes, saying, "These are people I've known for years. I 
know that ... it's subconscious and involuntary. But you can feel it." 

T
HR SUSPICIOUS GLANCES, the prejudice, the threats are 
nothing new to Sammy Mansour. He says of the still 
nascent ASA, of which he is the Political Action Chair, 
"We're accepted on campus, but we're always going to have to face 
opposition from some people who want to make us look like some 
evil organization." Mansour tells me about hateful emails, threats, 
and a nasty missive in the Valentine's Day issue of The Yale Herald. 
In this fall's Light & Troth "Freshman Survival Guide," Davi 
Bernstein, former co-president of Yale Friends of Israel (YFI), warns 
freshman to avoid the ASA, a group he labels as "anti-American." 

Many Arabs and Jews on campus felt compelled to take sides 
as Zionists and Palestinian nationalists clashed. The ASA was found-
ed last fall as the current Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, was tak-
ing shape in Israel. Though thousands of miles from the West Bank, 
the campus has again become a battleground as the violence con-
tinues. Two Israeli soldiers gave a Master's Tea in Trumbull College 
on November 15, 2000, and retired Israeli General Yoav Gallant 
addressed a large crowd assembled in sss on January 23, 2001, at an 
event organized by the YFI. Outisde each event, ASA students dis-
tributed leaflets and held protest signs. Both time's, police escorts 
were needed to eject unruly spectators, including the faculty advi-
sor to the ASA, genetics professor Mazin 
Qumsiyeh. ASA members heckled the Israeli 
soldiers, calling them Nazis, says one YFI 
member. Gallant said Palestinians were no 
better than dogs, an ASA member counters. 
Both sides deny the other's accusations. 

After the first incident, the ASA tried to 
arrange a compromise, according to the 
Yak Daily Nnus. Each group had scheduled 
speakers w appear at campus events on 
November 28, 2000. Fadi Kanaan, who 
had invited Norman Finklestein, a Jew 
known for criticizing Israel as a colonialist 
state, encouraged a debate between him 
and Ehud Luz, an Israeli political scientist 
invited to speak by YFI. Luz refused, how-
ever, out of "dignity and self respect," and 
the lectures were held separately and simul-
taneously. Instead of a dialogue, there were 
two monologues, each on its own stage. 

Verbal clashes continued into the 
spring semester, with partisans barraging 
the opinion pages of the N~s with guest 
columns, calling for dialogue and criticiz-
ing the other side for refusing to talk. The 
ASA lodged an informal complaint of 
harassment against YFI to the Yale College 
Dear~'s Office. A meeting between the two 
groups proposed by Assistant Dear~ Edgar 
Letriz never materialized after members of 
the A.SA rejected the invitation. In the last 
column the Nnus printed on the subject, 
which appeared on January 30, 2001, 
Qurnsiyeh repeated the same vain hope 
expressed by both sides: that the next inter-
action between the two groups be "a dia-
logue open to both sides equally and fair-
ly." What followed, however, were months 
of public silence. 

Now, nearly a year after the conflict, 
reconciling the partisans seems impossible. 
I tried to organize a group interview with 
Bernstein and Aaron Faust, former co-pres-
idents of YFI, along with Kanaan and 
Qumsiyeh. Both Bernstein and Kanaan 
explained that the two sides have grown so 
far apart that neither even recognizes the 
other's 
existence. 
Bernstein 
said, 
"Whenever we attempted a dialogue with 
the ASA, we were rebuffed and made to look 
like fools. This won't happen again. A 
proper dialogue is not possible with the ASA 
because they do not believe Israel is a legit-
imate entity, and thus YFI is not legitimate 
to them, either. This is the sad truth." 

Kanaan, who reluctantly agreed to the 
meeting, described a similar feeling among 
ASA members. "The YFI has ingrained mis-
perceptions of what the ASA is and what its 
members do," he explained. "They think 
we support Arafat and the dictators of the 
Arab world. We see ourselves as a group of 
Arabs and Arab-Americans who want to 
celebrate our culture and raise Arab aware-
ness on campus. We've tried to work with 
them before, but they bluntly refused. As a 
result, it's really difficult to have a group 
interview with last year's YPI leaders." 

Qumsiyeh was the only one to agree with 
enthusiasm; he even asked that the event 
take place in front of an audience. 

Faust also refused to participate in a 
group interview, though he did offer to 
meet me in person and c:xplain why. "The 
issue is unique in its emotional depth," he 
explained. Everyone involved has been per-
sonally touched by the violence. He 
recalled Qumsiyeh's stories of brutal treat-
ment at the hands of Israeli police. Faust 
himself has family members who've fought 
in every major Israeli-Palestinian war. He 
asked, "How is Mazin going to have an un-
emotional discussion with me?" The two 
groups might be able to talk, he speculated, 
but only if they discussed anything but pol-
itics. "Th~ can't be any dialogue between
