We find introducing this issue a heavy task. Since September 
11, an unrelenting wave of pronouncements and prophe-
cies have been offered up by student columnists, professors, 
community leaders, and other self-appointed arbiters of public opinion. 
Their basic tenet is the same: Our generation has experienced a trans-
formation of character; we find ourselves in a fundamentally altered 
world. 

But what do these words really mean? What is historical change sup-
posed to look like from the inside? Is it like continental drift, so slow and 
profound that it is entirely beyond our perception? Or is it like a Rash of 
_lightning illuminating a whole new landscape for an instant? We don't 
know. We are the children of the end of history. And even as the public 
bombast and Rood of editorials continue unabated, many around us slip 
back into routine, conversations, goals, and worries essentially 
unchanged. 

In this issue, we strive to see how history has brought us here, and to 
examine where we are now. The cover article "A Thin Blue Line" shows 
us that complete clarity never existed on this campus during wartime. 
The aw~ard self-consciousness of being 20 years old is not unique to 
the 21st century. The uncertainty and presumptuousness we feel does not 
make our attempts at clarity any less important or valid. 

Meanwhile, members of our community encounter concrete prob-
lems. As ''The Stranger Among Us" illustrates, Arabs Â·and Muslims 
among us are forced to confront social forces shockingly discordant with 
the tolerance so many of us profess. 

We cannot say definitively whether or not we live in a new world 
since September 11, whether our generation has a man~e to pick up, 1 
and whether the words we have written will weigh upon the scales of 
change. What we can say together, though, is that we have tried to do 
what this magazine has taken as its purpose since 1967: to put our 
moment into context.
