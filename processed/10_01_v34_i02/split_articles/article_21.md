of medical care legally permitted in all 
other states and in most foreign coun-
tries." Prior to 1965, 51 percent of families 
under the poverty line had no family plan-
ning. Thirty-one percent of children in 
New Haven were born to single women, 
and 15 percent of births were to mothers 
under the age of 18. 

Harper and Btdton's campaign was 
about more than making birth control 
available--it was about making birth con-
trol available to people of all classes, 
neighborhoods, and minority groups. 
According to Roraback, "if you knew the 
right person to get you to the right doctor 
and had the money, you could access birth 
control in Connecticut. Buxton was espe-
cially concerned that poor women would-
n't be able to get the services available to 
them." When Roraback, who still prac-
tices law in Hartford, was told that Yale 
offers RU-486 as part of its standard 
health plan, her response was exuberant. 
"Yale is so good," she said, "it's amazing." 
Still, some may ask whether Yale is 
doing all it can to serve the female stu-
dents, faculty~ staff, and families who use 
UHs. Is it possibl~ for. Yale to find a bal-
ance between patients' right to know 
about all their options and patients' right 
to get medical service in a non-politicized 
environment? Yale only needs to look to 
the example set by the Griswold-eta doc-
tors to see that political controversy need 
not inhibit the practice of medicine. Dr. 
Vuginia Stuermer, who worked at the 
Planned Parenthood clinic, recollected, 
"On the day Dr. Buxton and Mrs. 
Griswold were arrested I was running the 
clinic. And I came in the door and they 
said to me 'Dr. Stuermer, the cops are 
here. What should we do? And I said, 'We 
should see the patients."'
