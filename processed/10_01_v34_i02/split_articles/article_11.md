"THANK YOU, that's what I've been waiting 
to hear for three weeks." 

Whether my words differed from any-
one else's, I can't be sure. I've heard it said 
that William Jefferson Clinton, whenever 
he works a crowd, picks out one person for 
a heart-to-heart conversation-it has 
become his signature move. It could have 
been my words, it could have been my 
suave new Eddie Bauer glasses, or it could 
have been the awkward way I'd jammed a 
rain coat and a commemorative poncho 
and a program and a Caribbean novel 
under my left arm so that both of my hands 
were visible, as per the Secret Service's 
ordets. For whatever reason, when I mut-
tered my thanks to the former President 
and shook his hand just after hearing the 
final speech of Yale's tercentennial celebra-
tion, he stopped, kept my hand in his, and 
began to speak. 

President Clinton started by thanking 
me for my words and explaining the moti-
vation behind his speech. "I think that this 
is the best thing I can dq right now, espe-
cially since I'm no longer in public office. I 
can talk to the American people, explain 
5 

what's happening, and assure them that 
things will be all right." It seemed logical, 
although some might hope that a former 
President would use his experience and 
intelligence to shape policy decisions in the 
wake of mind-boggling events like the 
September n terrorist attacks. He then 
expressed concern for the country's young 
adults, who have never experienced such an 
insecure and unstable world. He reiterated 
to me the words of his speech, calling for 
more "positive interdependence" through-
out the globe. Because I had paid careful 
attention during his speech, I took this 
opportunity to in~estigate whether o~;..not 
President Clinton was truly wearing a 
toupee, as had been suggested by a neigh-
bor during the address. However, before I 
could assure myself that his coif was in fact 
real, I was drawn back into his presence by 
his careful reestablishment of eye contact. 

He decided to end with a note of humor, 
making us chuckle by saying, "Osama bin 
Laden doesn't like it when you Â·mention 
that, as a Muslim friend informed me, 
Mohammed's first wife was a wealthy inde-
pendent businesswoman who proposed to 
Mohammed herself." 

Listening to him, I felt better, as if the 
weight that had pressed down on my 
shoulders since the attacks had been lifted. 
For a moment, the same charisma that 
brought him eight years in the Presidency 
was focused on a small group ofYalies. The 
handshake in itself was impressive: Even 
though President Clinton is left-handed, 
the grip of his right hand on mine was 
strong at the outset and remained so for the 
ninety seconds he held it, increasing the 
pressure when certain points merited 
emphasis, until the demands of gesticula-
tion broke the bond of our palms. This, I 
thought, is a man who knows how to use a 
handshake. All of it-the touch, the 
relaxed southern drawl, the slow transfer of 
his gaze from one person's eyes to the next, 
the way he cowered over my six feet one 
inch, the musky scene of sweat built up in 
a suit over the course of a day-seemed to 
convey a sense of fatherly concern and 
truth to the throng surrounding him. 

As he moved away my palms were 
sweaty, my face was flushed, and my heart 
was pounding. I realized the import of his 
first words: President Clinton seemed to 
understand that his ideas and intelligence 
were, as they have always been, less impor-
tant than the inspiration and enveloping 
warmth he makes people feel. This is why 
his mere appearance in a crowd of jaded 
Yalies-students who had booed a video of 
the current President the night befor~ 
caused two standing ovations; the applause 
after the speech itself paled in comparison. 

It was only when he moved on and I 
attempted to work my way out of the 
crowd that I caught the gaze of friends and 
strangers around me, staring with awe and 
envy. Clinton moved away, and the crowd 
that had been pressed against my backside 
began to disperse. As I fought my way out, 
hearing the yells of others pressing forward 
to make contact with the former President 
before his motorcade pulled away, I realized 
that the clamor for pictures and hand-
shakes and words was not as ridiculous as 
I'd initially judged. President Clinton's 
vaunted intelligence and political acumen 
notwithstanding, all that had made him an 
important and powerful public figure 
could be captured in my moment with him 
on the steps before Sterling Memorial 
Library. Those packed into the crowd were 
competing to have just such a moment of 
their own.
