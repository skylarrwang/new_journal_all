EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
essacy for our future well-being, a justifica-
tion of our remaining in a university exis-
tence, none can deny." In ordinary times, 
Ivy League students hardly have co cast 
about for a justification of their education. 
But in times of war, as the students of the 
class of 1917 wrotl, "the constellation of 
Mars" has often eclipsed "the scar of knowl-
edge." 

THAT IS, UNTIL VIETNAM. "The deep 
misgivings about the war, compound-
ed by the immorality of using an 
inequitable draft to fight it, generates a bit-
ter skepticism of the values which motivate 
all established authority." These words 
come not from a leftist student publication 
but from 
Yale 
President 
Kingman 
Brewster's address to the freshmen (and for 
the ftrst time, women) in September 1969. 
During this war, the administration's ener-
gy was once again focused on preserving 
the integrity of the University. But, as 
Brewster recognized, the threat this time 
was internal. 

Yale studel;its of the time who talk now 
about the war years focus their attention on 
why the university was not destroyed by 
the nearly universal opposition to the war, 
the draft, and the establishment. Strobe 
Talbott, former deputy Secretary of State 
and head ofYale's new Center for che Study 
of Globalization, says, "At Yale the demon-
strations were almost universally peaceful, 
and if one person deserves credit for chat, 
it's Kingman Brewster. He really showed by 
example the importance of presenring the 
civility of discourse." 

Talbott was Chairman of the Nro;s in 
1967 when he published an editorial about 
a draft protest petition then in circulation, 
headed "They Won't Go." "Strobe Talbott 
actually is probably the single person who 
most turned Brewster against the war," says 
journalist Mark Zanger, who was immor-
talized as bushy-haired campus radical 
"Megaphone Mark" in Garry Trudeau's 
Doonesbury strips of the period. (Zanger 
claims che character is a composite.) 

"When [Strobe] joined the ocher edicors in 
writing a 'We Won't Go' editorial ... 
Brewster noticed that even the best and 
brightest by his definition were not going." 
For Zanger and ochers seeking co motivate 
direct action, however, the moderation of 
the leadership was not all positive. 

"Brewster was very hard for activists 
because he actually maintained some sense 
of openness . . . Ivy presidents like Cordier 
at Columbia or Pusey at Harvard, to name 
two, went down in the sixties because they 
took measures chat shut down and polar-
ized the campus. [At Yale] you couldn't just 
do anything and provoke acts of blatant 
stupidity." 

Whether it is called "elevation of dis-
course," "intellectualization," or modera-
tion, students speak of an apathy and 
ambivalence on campus chat didn't always 
come through in the music. "Many of 
those who opposed the war doubtless did 
so from a tangle of idealism and self-inter-
est," says Randy Helm, class ofi970. "And 
I suspect chat chose of us who were most 
passionate and angry were chose who, in 
our hearts, wondered whether self-interest 
was the larger factor." Zanger says the cam-
pus was slow to respond co the exhortations 
ofYale's Students for a Democratic Society, 
the main anti-war organization. "In 1966 
nobody showed up co a rally. In 1967 you 
would get maybe five or ten people. In 
early '68 we had an anti-war rally on the 
Green and Arthur Miller spoke, that was 
two co three thousand people. That was a 
peak." 

Then, several events in the spring of 
1970 changed the campus atmosphere: the 
murder trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale 
in New Haven, Nixon's illegal invasion of 
Cambodia, and the shooting of 13 student 
protesters at Kent State University. Even 
marginally involved students were sudden-

ly radicalized. "I spent most of senior year 
discovering the joys of getting high, hang-
ing out at our unofficial senior society's 
beach house . . . in short, senior pleasures 
typical of a more insouciant age," said Reid 
Detchon, class of 1970. "Bobby Seale's trial 
came to New Haven, and I was on the 
Green that spring day-protesting a little, 
mostly participating in the Event-when 
the news came that Nixon had bombed 
Cambodia. This evil man had decided to 
make the war worse, not end it, and we 
howled in anger and fear and outrage about 
America becoming Amerika, losing our 
hope that this democracy would respond to 
us. The campus was shut down by that out-
rage, by our inability to focus on anything 
else." Those days of mass protest on the 
Green were the closest that Yale ever came 
to "blowing up," and like Yale presidents 
past, Brewster responded to the students' 
fiery spirit with special war measures-this 
time by canceling final exams and allowing 
seniors to graduate based on work done to 
date. 

THE OTHER FORCE IN YALE's VIETNAM 
experieqce was, of course, the chap-
lain, civil rights and peace activist Reverend 
William Sloane Coffin, Jr. On September 
23, 2001, he returned here to speak on a 
panel on peace at BatteU Chapel. "When I 
came back to Yale these past few days, I was 
flooded with remembrances," he said in 
response to a question. "It was the Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution all over again. We were 
the second university after the University of 
Michigan to have a sit-in in I964, and we 
need to have another one now," he told a 
cheering crowd. This comparison doesn't 
work at all for Talbott, who is editing a 
forthcoming anthology of Yale professors, 
Th~ Ag~ of T~r, to address the post-
September 11 situation. "I have the greatest 
respect for Reverend Coffin," he says, "but 
the analogy doesn't take you very far. The 
Gulf of Tonkin was basically a case of 
harassment on the high seas, and now 
7,000 people have been killed. It's not 
accurate history and not f.lir either." 

Coffin and Talbott, like generations of 
Yale men before them, are drawing on their 
experience here to respond to a new kind of 
conflict. As a conscientious student I 
would like to learn from their example, but 
the historical analogies do not come easily. 
Today, just as in the Civil War, we at Yale 
and in the nation have been caught 
unaware, faced with an unprecedented 
threat at home. Just as in the world wars, 
the conflict is global in scope. Just as in 
Vietnam, opposition to the government's 
policies, at least in form, is the norm with-
in which we act. Is there a special mandate 
for action now? 

At the Tercentennial celebration, the 
President of Harvard quoted Theodore 
Roosevelt's words, "Wherever I have been 
engaged in a great endeavor I have found a 
Yale man by my side." Professor Smith 
points out that he didn't finish the quota-
tion-the "great endeavor" Roosevelt was 
specifically referring to was the bloody bat-
tle of San Juan Hill in the even bloodier 
Spanish-American War. One of Roosevelt's 
comrades-in-arms, Augustus Canfield 
Ledyard, class of 1898, is honored by the 
flagpole on Beinecke Plaza. "So the flagpole 
of the university celebrates not a very good 
cause---colonial oppression," Smith says. If 
making our mark on history is the Yale stu-
dent's obsession, we would now do well to 
determine where the mark should strike.
