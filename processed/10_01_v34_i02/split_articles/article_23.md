EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the days after September 11, Donald Kagan, a Yale professor of history and classics, threw himself into the campus debate. In a guest column in the Yale Daily News on September 18, Kagan called for vigilance, criticizing the likes of professor Paul Kennedy and globalization guru Strobe Talbott for going soft on terrorism and "blaming the victim." He wrote, "Such voices as those of Kennedy and Talbott are always available in countries such as ours. Their grievances about various aspects of our own country lead them to seek the causes of any troubles in us and to urge understanding of our enemies." Kagan likened Kennedy and Talbott to the intellectuals who advocated appeasement as Hitler rose to power.

In *While America Sleeps: Self-Delusion, Military Weakness, and the Threat to Peace Today* (2000), a book Kagan co-wrote with his son Frederick, a professor at West Point, the authors criticize US military policy over the last decade, and match Kagan's attacks on Kennedy and Talbott in forwardness and theme. The Kagans viciously pick apart US military policy, arguing that the world did not become safe with the fall of the Soviet Union and that the United States is ultimately responsible for this lapse in security. The book was at once frightening and affirming for me, a pacifist Iowan who has never expressed interest in foreign policy. It immersed me in the harsh language of Cold War realism for the first time. And though it seemed strange at the time, the language thrilled me. Instead of shaking my head while reading it, I found myself asking, "Why am I suddenly obsessed with war?"

"In the war of 2020, certainly, of 2010, possibly, perhaps even earlier, America will not be immune to direct attack anymore." This one sentence confers a new relevance on the book today. It is sweeping, bold, abrasive, and tragically prescient. But is it adequately explained by the writers' analysis?

Much of the book draws on official documents and statements of policy-makers. Colin Powell ominously notes, "there will be a next time; there always is." Clinton's Secretary of State William Perry states in words which now sound naive, "It's an entirely implausible scenario that we'd fight two wars at once." And Senator Les Aspin proposes a sweeping threat-based military policy that stands in stark contrast to the more absolute policy the Kagans favor. The authors shape the actors involved like literary characters. Aspin is impatient and misdirected. Dick Cheney is heroic and sagacious. In fact, each politician is disturbingly two-dimensional. The writers' political agenda is supported just enough by the ideas and writings of others to make the book palatable.


But the intentions of its authors are clear. America is falling down, the world is getting nasty, and something has to be done. The Kagans argue that the United States is in a position to suffer the same fate as Britain did in the 1930s: We are tangled in a web of "pseudoengagements" similar to those that drew England into World War II. Pseudoengagements, as the authors define them, are limited in scope and direction. They have the look of full-scale operations, minus the clear conclusion. For example, Slobodan Milosevic remained in power for several years after our intervention in the Balkans. An effective operation would have deposed him immediately; our "pseudoengagement" left him in control.

The lesson of the book is simple: Obliterating an opponent is a controversial plan of action, but not finishing the job is much worse.

Why, according to the Kagans, has our policy grown weak? "The 'Weimar syndrome' continues to paralyze American leaders." The United States refuses to touch anything that might escalate or de-escalate without warning, and is afraid of any engagement that might claim American lives. Volatility is unattractive to policy-makers, especially after the turbulence of the 60s and 70s. The Kagans realize this and warn, "There is no escape from the responsibility of judgment and no reason to believe that inaction is safer than action."


America's definition of war changed again after the Iraqi conflict, they say. "It is not enough to win; the victory must come at almost no cost ... engagement must not be prolonged, must entail no casualties, and must, almost always, avoid the use of ground forces." The Gulf War created a new model. Shaky engagements are now acceptable, so long as Americans are not hurt.


The authors argue that the United States has inexcusably failed to deter aggression worldwide. Since 1991 "declarations of false victories" have inflated American confidence, while the rest of the world shifted and sagged and schemed against us. Our Somalian campaign failed, our Haiti campaign was ineffective, Bosnia still requires constant intervention, Iraq is rebuilding its forces, and North Korea is still harboring weapons of mass destruction.

Forget specific examples for a moment. The authors' most disturbing conclusion is general: "Pseudoengagement has had the same effect in America as it had in Englandâ€”it has gravely complicated the efforts of those who favor real engagement to make their case." Kagan voiced this concern even more directly in his September 18 editorial. Intellectuals, he says, are always clamoring for peace, understanding, and rationality. But what happens when the irrational becomes reality? What happens when buildings fall down? What if the minority, that militant, unpopular minority, is absolutely correct? And what if no one listens?


Even if America has gone about things the wrong way, blatant aggression seems dangerous and foolish to many. The authors recognize this sentiment, knowing full well that almost everyone in his or her right mind rejects aggression in the abstract. They also seem to realize that they are perceived as both radical conservatives and self-aggrandizing intellectuals. The cleverness of *While America Sleeps* lies in the way they compensate for this perception by grounding their discussion in numbers and reasonable-sounding observations: "It is not clear that the high-technology weapons our forces now use can be mass-produced quickly." "By 1998 ... the US Army and US Marine Corps active force structure had been reduced to only 661,000 ..." "The United States does not fight wars within margins so tight." "The Gulf coalition has shattered; NATO and the United States risk drifting apart. Challengers of the status quo proliferate, along with weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them."

I am living in an uncertain world. And as I cast about for a theory that will contextualize the government's actions in Afghanistan, I can't help but entertain what the Kagans say:

We have shown how military weakness, combined with the desire to ignore unpleasant international realities, has led America to abandon control of the international scene, shirk its responsibilities, and place global stability and its own security in jeopardy ... has America allowed its military might to run down so far that the cost of restoring it might drive future administrations faced with real warning signs to ignore the dangers or seek unrealistic solutions? The answer, again, we fear, is yes.

I'm a quiet guy from the Midwest, who has never shot a gun. Yet I sit in my room, waiting for another tragedy, praying that Kagan is wrong, that any future conflict will be simple. If he is right, I hope I am not the only one who has tried to listen...
