I fought the bureaucracy, 
and it was a draw

office and modified at the East Hartford biometrics office.


I’m what you call DACA-mented. This means that 
starting in 2002, when my family came over from Uru­
guay and we overstayed our tourist visas, I was totally 
screwed (no papers), and ever since June 2012, when 
Obama decided that he did in fact have the Constitu­
tional authority to re-order our enforcement priorities 
through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
(DACA) program, I have been slightly less screwed. 
Since then, I have had a renewable work permit, 
which allows me to do luxurious things like “work,” 
“get a driver’s license,” and “pay taxes whose benefits 
I will not receive.” All of these privileges are courtesy 
of the Employment Authorization Document, my 
DACA-ment.

But let’s take a step back. I know, it’s crazy that my 
family has lived in South Carolina for thirteen years 
and doesn’t even have green cards. We overstayed our 
visas because we had an uncle who thought that he 
could get us green cards, but he was wrong. Oops. Yes, 
I am pretty American. No, there’s no pathway to cit­
izenship for people like me (all 665,000 Childhood 
Arrivals). I could do a green card marriage, but I’m not 
too keen on the idea of committing a felony. Yes, it’s 
a felony. United States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services (USCIS), has officers whose job it is to sniff 
out true love (what underwear does your spouse wear? 
When did you last have sex?). Yes, my parents would 
totally get deported by President Trump; they’re keep­
ing a set of Very American cheeseburgers constantly 
on the grill just in case Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) comes knocking.

With that out of the way, here we are: me, after 
more than a decade in this country, with a work permit 
that can get renewed every two years and serves as my 
only claim to any sort of lawful status in this country. 
I’m currently on my second such work permit, which 
means that I’m only in my fourth year of pseudo-le­
gality. Four years was apparently long enough for me 
to forget how precarious my position is. This is a story 
about what reminded me.

The drama is bureaucratic. Accordingly, it is logis­
tical and boring. I needed to renew my work permit, 
which was going to expire on October 2, 2016. This 
procedure involves some very simple paperwork, which 
I filed in May, and an eventual biometrics appoint­
ment, where USCIS would take my fingerprints and 
picture. Dealing with USCIS is an exercise in waiting 
patiently, so I wasn’t too concerned when July passed 
with no biometrics appointment. But by the end of 
August, I was worried—I now had a month until the 
expiration of my permit, and USCIS takes a month to 
blink. I started inquiring about my case. 

Now, I’ll give credit where credit is due. USCIS has 
a pretty spiffy-looking website, and sometimes it even 
works. It was on this spiffy website, on September 8, 
2016, that I was told—by cursive lettering in a very aes­
thetically pleasing scrollwork graphic—that “on August 
5, 2016, we scheduled you for a biometrics appoint­
ment and mailed you an appointment notice for 
Receipt Number [redacted].” This message presented 
a significant problem. USCIS had not processed an 
address change in time, it turns out, and had sent my 
biometrics appointment to the place I lived during my 
summer job in Fort Lauderdale, whose owner decided 
I didn’t need to be informed about the envelope from 
USCIS that arrived a few days after I left. Now we 
arrive at the emotional high point of the drama: me, 
in the Trumbull College Library, staring at a computer 
screen, silent. (In my mental landscape, screaming and 
breaking things.) 

An expired work permit would mean being fully 
undocumented for a pretty long time as an entirely new 
application was processed. A quick recap of Things It 
is Difficult to Do While Undocumented: work, get on 
an airplane, present ID for literally anything. In short, 
prove to anyone at all that you are a person who exists. 
It would also mean that I would begin accruing unlaw­
ful presence, which would make several pathways to 
legal status more difficult, and, after 180 days, trigger 
a three-year bar on coming back into the country if I 
ever were to leave. I had grown so accustomed to my 
legal status that all of this came as something of a shock 
and an affront. Me? I’ve figured this out! You can’t do 
this to me (again). As my dear friend Donald might say: 
Wrong!

There’s no way to write about what happened next in 
an interesting way, because it was intensely uninterest­
ing. I talked to an immigration lawyer, who advised me 
that there was a biometrics office in East Hartford, and 
that the Hartford USCIS office could print my appoint­
ment notice. I duly made an appointment in Hartford. 
There, I did indeed receive my appointment notice. 
Then, I went to East Hartford, where I explained to the 
immigration officer that I was really trying not to get 
deported and would he please consider letting me do 
the biometrics there with my old appointment notice? 
He smirked a little—I think he was on to my game—
and then said yes, proceeding to edit the appointment 
notice with the most beautiful orange pen I had ever 
seen.

And with that, the ball went out of my court and into 
that of USCIS, which now has to decide whether or not 
my crisis-intervention was timely enough. I wait. Omit­
ted from this boring narrative is a phone call to parents 
(screaming, but who wouldn’t scream) and a strained 
week of being able to accomplish nothing aside from 
making people uncomfortable with my near-hysterical 
jokes about getting deported (“This won’t be funny 
when I’m getting deported!” followed by nervous 
laughter). And, of course, approximately half of the 
World’s Greatest Democracy wishing I would skip all 
this trouble and just get the hell out. 

Maybe USCIS will play nice and renew my work per­
mit despite the delay. This is good. It will not change 
the fact that my legal status depends every two years on 
the caprices of a clanking federal bureaucracy. It will 
not change the fact that the only thing between my 
parents and ICE is the generous, memo-writing hand 
of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh 
Johnson. It does not change the fact that immigration 
reform with a path to citizenship, which would elimi­
nate this country’s institutionalized socio-legal under­
class, is a proposal easily defeated because “amnesty” 
is a bad word in the national morality play. Millions 
of people are at the mercy of How the Base is Feeling.

How The Base Is Feeling becomes law, becomes 
bureaucratic protocol, becomes ontological reality. In 
the nineties, the Base Felt that there were too many 
damn foreigners streaming in from Cuba, and, accord­
ingly, the State of California took the entirely logical 
step of proposing to ban undocumented children from 
public schools. I want to go visit my relatives in Uru­
guay, some of whom I haven’t seen in thirteen years? 
Thunk! I bounce off the invisible walls erected by the 
law. My dad has to drive to work? Thunk! Maybe he 
gets arrested, because the State of South Carolina 
would rather have unlicensed drivers on the road than 
cede to the Illegals by doing anything so weak as giving 
them driver’s licenses. (The People of South Carolina 
seem pretty comfortable with their cheap vegetables, 
and with my dad painting their houses.) 

What is left to say? My life almost got ruined because 
of a bureaucratic hiccup (and still could). Donald 
Trump might become President. As I have been whin­
ing to you in the pages of a Yale magazine, millions of 
undocumented workers have been subsidizing the very 
pleasant lives of people who, at worst, want to ethnically 
cleanse them, and, at best, would probably rather the 
invisible labor stay invisible. Maybe, while you read, 
ICE knocked on some doors to Enforce Our Nation’s 
Immigration Laws. A few weeks ago, I saw someone in 
Ray Bans and chinos wearing a Make America Great 
Again T-shirt. What a fun intellectual exercise that 
must be for him. Fuck this.
