went for bike rides and lifted weights with his mother 
Cyndy, a personal trainer, and ate dinner with her five 
nights a week.

To Grinde, Montana is the greatest place in the 
world. “You feel a sense of freedom,” he wrote. “Peo­
ple in Montana are able to live their lives doing what 
they want to do.” In Great Falls and the surrounding 
suburbs, football is king, and Grinde was at the center 
of it all. He started playing flag football in third grade, 
tackle in fifth. This will be the first season he’s sat out.

“Football played a huge role in my life,” he wrote. 
“All the life lessons it taught me, the pathways it 
opened up for me, the relationships I gained from it.”

As a junior, Grinde was named Montana’s Gato­
rade Player of the Year. That year, he rushed a class 
record of 2,180 yards and twenty touchdowns, leading 
the C.M. Russell High School Rustlers to the Class 
AA state championship game. His name shows up five 
times in the state record books. “Watch his film,” Yale 
Assistant Coach Derrick Lett told me. “He’s the best 
player in Montana.”

The eleven-minute high school highlight reel, which 
has been viewed over two thousand times online, is 
utterly silent. No 2 Chainz, no trap beats, not even a 
roar from the crowd. There’s nothing to distract from 
the football. At 210 pounds, Grinde has the stocky 
build of a power running back. But he’s got speed, too; 
the video opens with Grinde catching a screen in the 
backfield and sprinting seventy yards down the left 
sideline with the entire defense in hot pursuit. In the 
next clip, he jukes a hapless defender to the ground. 
He blocks a massive lineman onto his back, makes a 
leaping sideline catch, and spins out of a defender’s 
arms in a split second.

The Gatorade press release mentions academic cre­
dentials in step with Grinde’s athletic prowess: 4.0 GPA, 
vice president of his class, elementary school tutor, 
Special Olympics and United Way volunteer, youth 
soccer coach. He played basketball on the side—and 
led the state in three-point shooting percentage. Paul 
Rice, Yale’s Montana recruitment coordinator, tracked 
Grinde down after that junior season. “He had Ivy 
League aspirations and grades,” Lett said. He was the 
kind of recruit coaches covet. Harvard and Columbia 
were after him, too, but ultimately Grinde chose Yale. 
He liked Yale’s coaching staff, he had gotten along well 
with his teammates during his recruitment visit, and he 
was excited to live in New Haven.

Grinde’s success brought him statewide renown. 
“He’s a small-town hero,” wrote Patrick Brennan, a 
high school friend of Grinde’s. “Everyone wanted to be 
associated with him.” That reputation awaited Grinde 
at Yale: Division I football, a potential starring role, the 
chance to play in front of tens of thousands of fans at 
the Harvard-Yale Game.

OCTOBER 2016
Composite Team Rankings. Preseason training began 
on July 2; though the team can’t hold official prac­
tice until late August, the summer months provide a 
chance for incoming freshmen to lift, condition, and 
bond. Grinde seemed to be thriving. “He was doing 
well with the players,” Lett said. “All signs were that he 
was happy.”

“We all loved Andy,” Herring agreed. “Andy was the 
man.”

But for a college student, playing football means sac­
rifice. Players can’t schedule classes between two and 
eight. The afternoons are packed with treatment ses­
sions, film sessions, and practice. Sometimes, the com­
mitment pushes players to the brink. “When we have 
early morning lifting, we always joke about quitting,” 
Herring said. “But we’re never going to do it.”

“If you don’t love the game,” Tribble said, “you’d 
rather die than play college football.”


In Grinde’s junior year of high school, as the acco­
lades came pouring in, the demands of the sport started 
to wear on him, and he began to consider taking a year 
off before college. “I knew a break off for one year 
would rejuvenate me,” he wrote. “The only reason I did 
not act on my dream was because of football.” Grinde’s 
array of academic and athletic demands was a heavy 
burden. “Privately, he’s under tremendous expecta­
tions and stress,” wrote Brennan. “In the public eye, 
he’s calm and true.”

After a season of awards and broken records, Grinde’s 
future was secure. He committed to Yale on August 6, 
2015, before his senior year at C.M. Russell. But his 
love for football started to erode. As the season began, 
he had doubts about whether he wanted to play for 
four more years. Football was making him feel sick 
of school, and impeding his “will to be a happy and 
innovative student,” he wrote. Then, in a mid-October 
game against Billings Senior, he fell on his left shoul­
der and his AC joint separated, sidelining him for sev­
eral games.

Football is a dangerous game, and Grinde knows it. 
“My brother studies neuroscience in college and has 
been warning me about head trauma for a while now,” 
he wrote. “Any life changing injuries like that worry me 
quite a bit, especially since I was blessed with a mind 
that got me into Yale.” Still, Grinde insisted, he never 
would have stopped playing for fear of injury. But in 
the midst of a season in which he was already recon­
sidering his commitment to the sport, this was another 
setback.

As his senior spring turned to summer, Grinde felt 
increasingly set on taking a year off. He knew he could 
rejoin Yale’s team after a year away, though a longer 
deferral would be harder for the coaches to accept. But 
he balked at the last moment and decided to give the 
team a shot. Back home, he was lifting for ten hours 
a week; he showed up to camp at 225 pounds and felt 
stronger than he ever had before.

But at Yale, summer training was nothing like 
Grinde’s usual routine. The team spent only two hours 
a week lifting; the majority of training was spent out 
on the fields, running and doing conditioning drills. 
Grinde lost ten pounds and performed worse and worse 
on the team’s weekly speed and vertical tests. Though 
his teammates and coaches believed otherwise, the 
summer was a struggle for him. He wasn’t enjoying 
football anymore. “I was weaker and slower at the end 
of [the summer] than I should have been,” he wrote. 
“The summer training sucked a lot of my confidence 
for the sport right out of me.”

As August approached, the thought of leaving lin­
gered in Grinde’s mind. He came to a realization: if he 
were to be happy at school, football couldn’t be a part 
of his life. He made the decision. “I never in a million 
years thought I would work up the courage to actually 
take off like I did,” he wrote. “But one night I just did 
it.”

At first, the team heard nothing. Then, a text. The 
only reason he was playing football, Grinde explained, 
was because his dad wanted him to. He didn’t love the 
game anymore. A couple of days after his departure, 
there was another update, this time from Chicago. Two 
weeks later, that was the last the other Yale football 
players heard from him.

The team was blindsided. Incoming freshmen foot­
ball players leave their schools fairly often, Lett said; 
they get homesick, or lose their sense of commitment 
to the sport. But this rarely happens at Yale. In fact, as 
far as Lett knows, this is the first time it’s happened in 
Tony Reno’s five seasons as Head Coach.

Grinde knew he was ultimately headed back home 
to Montana, but he had no plan, no timetable. From 
IN GREAT FALLS AND THE 
SURROUNDING SUBURBS, 
FOOTBALL IS KING, AND 
GRINDE WAS AT THE 
CENTER OF IT ALL.

Philadelphia, he took a train to Harrisburg. Then a 
bus to Pittsburgh. A midnight train to Chicago. He 
explored each city by day and slept on trains and buses 
by night. He was free, careening across the country on 
his own—but not for long.

Steve Schreck of the Great Falls Tribune reported 
Grinde’s departure from Yale on August 24, writing that 
Grinde, “one of the most heralded recruits in recent 
Rustler history, will not be a part of the Yale football 
program this season.” John Amsden, a personal injury 
attorney from Bozeman, Montana, saw the news. He 
reached out to Grinde and offered to help him find 
work in Bozeman. In the midst of his travels, Grinde 
accepted a position as a legal assistant at Amsden’s law 
firm, Beck, Amsden & Stalpes, PLLC. Though Grinde 
had planned to travel for a few more weeks, he put his 
wanderlust aside and took a twenty-eight-hour train 
ride from Chicago, through Minneapolis, and back to 
Montana. Now, Grinde is keeping himself busy, work­
ing at the firm forty hours a week. He has been doing 
research for testimonies, gathering information for 
cases, and assisting Great Falls District Judge Dirk San­
defur in his campaign for a seat on Montana’s Supreme 
Court. In his free time, Grinde takes online courses on 
real estate. And he still works out for a couple of hours 
every day.


Throughout his childhood, Grinde longed to play 
in the NFL. But gradually, that ambition faded. Back 
in Montana, he is pursuing a new dream: a year away 
from football. But even now, the game follows him. He 
owes his internship in part to his stardom—after his 
career at C.M. Russell, the entire state had his back.

Now, he talks of other dreams, of traveling from city 
to city on his own. “I decided to quit living my life for 
other people,” he wrote. He wants to make enough 
money to travel the world. Where does he want to go? 
He tells me it’s “quite a long list.” One day, he hopes 
to buy a lake house. He mentions this out of the blue. 
Why a lake house? “There’s nothing but good vibes 
while staying at a lake house,” he wrote. “And I am 
all about good vibes.” As Grinde dreams of his future, 
football doesn’t appear to cross his mind.

Lett is adamant that Grinde will be back on the team 
next year. “He just needed a bit more time,” Lett said. 
“It’s like riding a bike. When you’re a running back, it’s 
all natural.”

Grinde, however, is uncertain if he’ll return. “I do 
not see myself rejoining the football team,” he wrote 
me. But then, a few days later, he sent me another 
email: “There’s still a chance I’ll play.”

As Yale’s football season unfolds, 107 of his former 
teammates will be lifting, practicing, and playing 
together in New Haven. At Beck, Amsden & Stalpes, 
over two thousand miles away, Grinde will be sitting at 
a desk, living for himself.
