At PoleFly, sexiness and sport go together

Wooster Square’s hottest fitness 
space is an empty dance studio with 
ten-foot metal poles bolted to the 
ground and ceiling. On a recent Sun­
day, a friend and I visited the studio, 
which sits in a small brick building 
across the street from Sally’s Apizza. It 
was a hot and humid day, and the last 
thing I wanted to do was exercise—
especially when that exercise was pole 
dancing.

A tall, lanky woman with pink-
streaked, 
strawberry-blonde 
hair 
greeted us at the door. She wore a tight 
blue crop top and low-rise sweatpants 
with slits up the sides showing off 
toned, muscular legs. She introduced 
herself as Jessica Lynn, our instructor 
and the owner of the studio, PoleFly. 
We walked into a room with wall-to-
wall mirrors, lined with stability balls, 
light hand weights, and yoga mats. It 
was a cozy space, private and serene. 
But the eight poles interspersed 
throughout the room made it obvious 
that this was not your traditional dance 
class. 

Lynn gave us a rundown of the stu­
dio rules. Number one: no jewelry. It 
can scratch the poles. Number two: 
no lotion. While poling, your palms, 
among other things, can get sweaty, 
and lotion weakens your grip. As my 
friend said, “This pole is more stable 
than any relationship I’ve ever been 
in.” Nobody wants to complicate that 
with lotion. 

PoleFly opened in 2013 and, in 
addition to pole dancing, offers aerial 
hoop, barre, and chair dancing classes. 
Lynn was surprised that my friend and I had never heard 
of the studio before; Yale students are some of her best 
customers. Visitors range from members of Yale Danc­
ers to students at the Divinity School to players on the 
football team. But her most frequent patrons? Women 
at bachelorette parties.  

Pole dancing has been popular since the nine­
teen-eighties, but its reputation and purpose are con­
tested and evolving. In recent years, many pole afi­
cionados have championed it as a non-sexual form of 
exercise. “Up until a few years ago,” Lynn said, “to say 
you did pole dancing was a taboo.” Before she opened 
PoleFly, Lynn worked as a bartender in downtown New 
Haven. She took pole-dancing classes in order to stay 
in shape, but when she mentioned her pole work, cus­
tomers at the bar responded by asking her which club 
she danced for. 

At the same time, there are amateur and professional 
competitions for pole enthusiasts, branded as purely 
athletic. Like at nightclubs, woman are usually the ones 
competing, and the uniform is often a glorified bra and 
underwear—but that’s more utilitarian than aesthetic. 
Skin contact with the pole is required for inversions 
because it creates the friction needed for flips and 
tricks (another reason for the “no lotion” rule). And for 
these athletes, little about pole dancing is glamorous. 
They have callused hands, they get bruises, and their 
skin peels off. Still, the US Pole Dance Federation—an 
organization founded in 2008 to organize national pole 
dancing competitions—boasts the tagline “The Sleek, 
The Strong, The Sexy.” Lynn said that the purely ath­
letic focus ignores the fact that many women learn how 
to pole dance as a form of entertainment, not exercise. 
Now, most competitions have a separate section for 
“exotic dance.” And studios like PoleFly, popping up 
across the country, walk a delicate line between draw­
ing customers through the activity’s sexy reputation 
and insisting on its serious athleticism. 

We began the class with a light warm up to “Uptown 
Funk.” After we finished our squats and dynamic

stretches, we started to learn a couple of basic tricks. 
Our first move was called “walking around the pole,” 
which consisted of walking around the pole. Then we 
moved on to some more complicated moves, the most 
intense being the fireman spin. Imagine a fireman slid­
ing down the pole in the station to get to the truck. 
That’s the basic configuration of the spin, but instead 
of sliding down, you use the momentum from initially 
swinging your outside leg (the one farthest from the 
pole) to leap up and spin around the pole several times. 
I did it, but I can’t say it was graceful. Lynn made it 
all look easy. She has been “poling” for about five and 
a half years, ever since a friend took her to a class and 
got her hooked. She loved the challenge of it, and she 
found it much more fun than working out at the gym. 
She supplemented her classwork by training at home 
on a pole she had installed in her living room.

“I have a ton of toenail polish scrapings on my ceil­
ing from inversion kicks I would practice on the pole,” 
she said with a laugh. “It’s only about eight feet tall.”

Next we learned some “sassy floorwork” to combine 
with the pole tricks for a final dance combination. First 
up: the body roll.

“Imagine you’re squatting over a nasty toilet at a club 
and then you’re using the pole to help roll your body 
up,” Lynn explained. “Now slide all the way down the 
pole to the floor with your legs in a wide squat position 
like you don’t even care how dirty the bathroom floor 
is.”

Described as such, the moves did not sound sexy. 
Lynn went on to describe the first part of a turn as 
“sniffing your armpit.” She tries to make her language 
as desexualized as possible. 

“Once you say the word ‘sexy,’ people get uncom­
fortable,” she explained. “Most people come here for 
a workout, and even the people that do come here to 
learn how to dance ‘sexy’ get anxious when they actu­
ally hear that word.” 

PoleFly offers about twenty-five group classes a 
week, but instructors also lead private parties. And 
those, according to Lynn, get a bit crazier; at bachelor­
ette parties, Lynn will often lead chair or lap dancing 
classes. In such cases, it’s clear that the participants are 
not there for a workout, so Lynn often uses more sex­
ual language than she would use in a traditional class. 
Although the crowds are rowdier, she enjoys teaching 
them: it’s usually everyone’s first time poling, and the 
vibe is less morning-at-the-gym and more night-at-the-
club. But the number one rule she gives to groups is 
that they are not allowed to attend the class under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol. 

“It’s a workout, so they can’t be drunk and trying to 
do it,” Lynn explained.

Not everybody follows the rules. “One girl was so 
drunk that I had her just sit in the corner and play with 
one of the stability balls,” Lynn said. “She still threw 
up.”

We performed our final routine to Beyoncé’s “Me, 
Myself, and I.” It was about a minute and a half long, 
and it combined the moves we had learned: walks 
around the poll, fireman spins, and body rolls among 
others. I can’t really say how I looked while doing it. 
I was watching Lynn the whole time, trying to mimic 
her movements. By the end, I was dizzy from all of our 
spinning and had broken a sweat. The next morning 
I woke up with sore arms despite the fact I had barely 
left the ground. I watched some videos of professional 
pole events, and I was struck by the athleticism of the 
women competing. Pole dancing is no joke: it’s a seri­
ous workout. Yet when I was on the phone with my 
mom later that week and she asked what I did Sunday 
afternoon, I didn’t tell her about my time at PoleFly. 
Lynn said pole dancing “doesn’t have to be a shameful 
thing,” but it still wasn’t something I wanted to talk 
about. 

During the class, Lynn and the other women, includ­
ing myself, wore their hair down. Being able to flip your 
hair while performing the dance makes it more fun. 
But I have never been in another fitness class where 
everyone kept their hair down. We were doing chal­
lenging moves, but at the same time we were being, 
well, sexy. PoleFly instructors don’t use sexual language 
because they don’t need to: people taking their classes 
know what they’re signing up for. While for women, it’s 
hard to be simultaneously sexual and athletic, for men 
there’s no such clear divide. What PoleFly and profes­
sional pole dancers are attempting to do is clear a space 
for women to be both. It’s no small feat.
