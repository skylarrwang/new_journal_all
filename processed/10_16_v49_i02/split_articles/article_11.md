THE  NEW  JOURNAL
face. I know the photo will land on Facebook, where I 
am currently faceless. 
Last April, I deleted my account because I had never 
been interested in following the lives of people I had 
never been close to. However, scrolling through Chirik­
jian’s album on the temporary account I made just for 
this purpose, I feel a sense of closeness with him that is 
unreasonable after only one interview. I know how his 
friend Gabe Eats Fries (#641), with the ketchup at the 
center of the paper plate, and I fall a little in love with 
the way Martha looks in the golden light of afternoon 
in Post-Run Last-Minute Shopping (#121). If I don’t 
feel like I really know Chirikjian, I know at least that I 
am not alone at Yale—that others, too, have Late Walks 
Back from the Library (#298), write Late Papers (#602), 
and sometimes feel as if the world is Cold and Desolate 
(Photo #646). 
In Timothy Dwight, where Chirikjian will hold a 
spring gallery show displaying his project, the commu­
nity has embraced the shots as a shared album. It has 
become a point of pride, he says, for students in the 
college to appear in the photos. 
Chirikjian himself, however, has a hard time remem­
bering a lot of his photos save for his most recent addi­
tions to the album. He calls each photo a reminder of 
the day’s events, stimulating his memory, but he seems 
more concerned with the sense of measured time the 
photos lend him. 
“Everyone here is doing so much,” Chirikjian says, 
and sometimes it overwhelms him. “You talk to any 
one person, and they’ll tell you some of what they’re 
doing, but often they’ll just forget because of the mag­
nitude.” The photos, he tells me, help him understand 
his own progress. 
So many of these pictures are gorgeously composed, 
capturing foggy nights in a dreamscape of soft lavender. 
Chirikjian is a serious artist, and I wondered, as I spoke 
with him, whether the album just amounts to a cele­
bration of his numerous joys on campus. But if I wasn’t 
convinced that Chirikjian’s album is relatable, or com­
pletely naturalistic, I stop questioning once I finally 
find my own photo in the album, #784. I’m convinced 
I fit into what Chirikjian, in a low voice at the end of 
our conversation, tells me in his most pressing sense of 
purpose with the album title.
 “I want to get intimate moments,” he says. “I want to 
get something real. Realer.” 
In the photo, I’m smiling wider than usual with a 
forced slouch. I want to seem comfortable, as if we’re 
talking casually. Looking at the photo, it’s easy to forget 
that Chirikjian, once the shutter snapped, left quickly; 
that he will take another photo, and another, and 
another, until he graduates; that we talked only once. 
But still, in between frames, there is a quiet moment to 
remember with him.
