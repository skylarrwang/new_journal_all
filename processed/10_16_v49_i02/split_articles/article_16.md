Alex Thomas, a junior astrophysics major, set down 
his plate and waved his arm. “Meeeeeeee!” he shouted 
at Luntz. “Everyone in America raises their hand,” he 
joked. Thomas, who is the first person in his family to 
go to college, grew up in a largely agricultural, Repub­
lican-leaning community in southern Ohio. He and his 
mother plan to vote for Clinton, even though they dis­
like her, because “she’s not Trump.”

Like Thomas, most of the focus group voters raised 
their hands in answer to Luntz’s question. They chose 
words like “incompetent,” “obnoxious,” “fake,” “liar,” 
and “scary” to describe the candidates, exuding outrage 
and bewilderment. “They’re both honest and dishon­
est,” one woman said. “It depends what you want your 
honesty on.” 

“This entire debate is going to be a slugfest,” one 
on-screen voter predicted. “Back and forth, all personal 
attacks.”

Some of the New Republicans giggled. Grant 
Gabriel, a senior from Nevada who had been involved 
with the College Republicans for three years and has 
worked for Newt Gingrich, shook his head at the televi­
sion. “I’m not going to find this funny,” he said. 

Gabriel describes himself as a “pragmatic conser­
vative,” being moderate on social issues and farther 
right on fiscal policy—approximately the outlook of 
the majority of the self-described conservatives I inter­
viewed for this story. He says he watched with shock 
as Donald Trump “took the political world by storm.” 
As a Classics major, however, he believes history has 
shown that populist movements like Trump’s fizzle out 
quickly. That’s what he hopes will happen, leaving the 
Republican Party he loves intact. He wants the long-
term lesson of Trump and his furious supporters to be 
that the Republican Party must do a better job address­
ing the needs of working-class voters. At the same time, 
he thinks the party must reject Trumpism (and “Trum­
pian rhetoric,” to use another favorite New Republican 
phrase) to move forward. 

A dozen or so Yale students, all men, stared at a 
television tuned to CBS. They had packed into the 
common room of sophomore Michael Fitzgerald’s Sil­
liman suite to watch the first debate of the first presi­
dential election in which they are old enough to vote. 
The men lean right, politically, but they had officially 
disavowed the Republican candidate on stage: Donald 
J. Trump. Trump was the reason they were all in Fitz­
gerald’s suite, instead of at the Yale College Republi­
cans’ watch party in Linsly-Chittenden Hall across 
campus. In August, after the Yale College Republicans 
endorsed Trump, four of the board members, includ­
ing Fitzgerald, quit and started their own organization, 
the New Republicans. They pledged in an inaugural 
Facebook post to be “a more active Republican organi­
zation on campus that will always put national interests 
above partisan ones.”

On the one hand, this position ensured they could 
experience some satisfying schadenfreude no matter 
who prevailed in the debate, because neither candi­
date could embarrass them. On the other hand, what­
ever Trump said over the course of the next 90 min­
utes, given his track record, would probably add to an 
unseemly chapter for the Republican Party they still 
mostly supported, and a less-than-shining moment for 
a democracy they still fervently believed in. 

Fitzgerald, a sophomore who favors tidy slacks and 
plaid button-downs, provided Pepe’s Pizza and bottles 
of Pepsi. As the New Republicans grabbed slices and 
settled in on couches and chairs, Republican poll­
ster Frank Luntz held a conversation on CBS with a 
focus group of 27 undecided Pennsylvania voters wear­
ing blue and white “Hello My Name Is…” stickers. A 
woman with pink hair said she was leaning towards 
Hillary (“There’s a surprise,” a New Republican noted 
drily), while a middle-aged white man declared him­
self the “most Trump person in this room.” A freshman 
who had met the New Republicans at the extracurricu­
lar bazaar alternated between glances at the screen and 
his Bible, which he was reading for Directed Studies. 
Frank Luntz asked the focus group, “Who here is mad 
at the choices we have for President?”
