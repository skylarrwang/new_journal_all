Thomas Pogge stands in the doorway of a classroom 
in Linsly-Chittenden Hall, surrounded by a gaggle of 
students. He’s just finished teaching “Global Finan­
cial Integrity,” a Yale college seminar that meets Mon­
days at 3:30 p.m., in style: ten minute late, to rousing 
applause. 

On a Monday afternoon like this, well into Yale’s fall 
semester, it’s easy to forget that just a few months ear­
lier, Pogge was publicly accused of sexual misconduct. 
Last spring, in a Buzzfeed News article entitled “Eth­
ics and the Eye of the Beholder,” Yale graduate stu­
dent Fernanda Lopez Aguilar alleged that Pogge used 
his position to manipulate her into a sexual relation­
ship, punishing her professionally after she resisted his 
advances. The article reported that this incident was 
just one example of Pogge’s misconduct, an “increas­
ingly open secret in the international philosophy com­
munity.” After Lopez Aguilar filed a federal Title IX 
complaint in October 2015, Yale reviewed the case, 
finding evidence of “unprofessional conduct” but not 
enough to support claims of “sexual harassment.”

On June 20, 2016, more than 150 professors and 
colleagues in the field signed an open letter condemn­
ing Pogge’s behavior. “Based on the information that 
has been made public, we strongly condemn [Pogge’s] 
harmful actions toward women, most notably women 
of color, and the entire academic community,” it reads. 
As of its last update on 9:40 PM EST on July 13, 2016, 
the letter has 1,013 signatures. 

Esteemed English professor Harold Bloom has faced 
similar accusations to those mounted against Pogge, 
most publicly in Naomi Wolf’s explosive 2004 New 
York Magazine cover story, “The Silent Treatment.” 
“I was the object of an unwanted sexual advance from 
a professor at Yale,” she wrote, naming Bloom. She 
recounted a strange candle-lit dinner he’d insisted 
upon, during which he had placed his hand firmly on 
her inner thigh. Wolf insisted that Bloom’s advances 
also seemed to be part of an open secret, and wrote 
that she and other former female students had come 
forward with allegations of their own, and condemned 
Yale for not taking the complaints seriously. But 
because the public accusations were made twenty years 
after the private transgressions, Yale again did not take 
action. Critics argued Wolf’s claims were based purely 
on hearsay; Meghan O’Rourke wrote a column in Slate 
vilifying the testimony, called “Crying Wolf.”

The University has not removed Bloom or Pogge, 
because however much media attention their lapses 
received, neither professor has been found guilty by 
Yale—and in Bloom’s case, Yale never investigated. 
This semester, students are again offered the oppor­
tunity to study under these professors, both of whom 
are widely regarded in their fields. Pogge and Bloom’s 
upper-level seminars are both application-based, and 
Pogge’s intro level course is just one of three options to 
fulfill the Political Philosophy requirement in the Eth­
ics, Politics, and Economics major. All three classes are 
small, but every student sitting there made a conscious 
decision to do so.

The complicated nature of the professors’ pub­
lic personas introduces a graver consideration to the 
course-selection process: Should students consider 
allegations like these as they decide to take certain 
classes? Is there a moral calculation involved, and are 
students making it?

—
“The idea that it might be morally wrong to refrain 
from taking a class for the reason that its instructor 
has been accused of sexual misconduct—this idea is 
pretty bizarre,” Pogge wrote to me in an email. An arti­
cle like the one I am writing, he argued, participates 
in the propagation of sexual misconduct charges that 
may be false. “To be sure, any undeserved harm your 
story inflicts could be outweighed by e.g. a compelling 
public interest. In the present case, however, the pub­
lic interest served by your story seems miniscule: the 
ethical question you pose is barely worth discussing 
and could be discussed equally well in generic terms, 
without alerting readers to the accusations against me.”

It’s not surprising Pogge would be willing to look at 
this philosophical question more abstractly—he is a 
philosophy professor. But given the allegations against 
him, some find his ethical focus troubling. This semes­
ter, his seminar is focused on “Global Financial Integ­
rity”; in the spring, they are titled “Ethics & Interna­
tional Affairs” and “Recent Work on Justice.”

“I feel like humans hate hypocrisy instinctively,” said 
Grace Paine, a senior majoring in Political Science 
who considered taking Pogge’s class before realizing

who would be teaching it. “And so the idea of tacitly 
showing my respect for this person of authority—who 
speaks from his position of authority on morality and 
has a documented history of behaving immorally 
toward young women and abusing his position of 
power—when he talks about global abuses of power 
didn’t sit right with me.” 

However, Pogge’s area of philosophical expertise 
actually has little to do with the kinds of personal and 
professional morality that have been called into ques­
tion, argued Shelly Kagan, a colleague of Pogge in the 
Philosophy department. Pogge studies global poverty 
alleviation, and argues that wealthy countries like the 
United States should help developing countries not in 
the name of “charity,” but out of obligation. 

“Despite the fact that [Pogge] might have behaved 
in ways that seem distasteful and unprofessional and 
even immoral,” Kagan said, “the forms of misconduct 
are not forms of conduct that have anything to do with 
his area of teaching.” 

Lopez Aguilar, who grew up in Honduras, argued 
the opposite. In addition to accusing Yale of violating 
Title IX, which concerns sex-based discrimination, she 
also filed a Title VI complaint, which concerns race. 
“He has a taste for women, most ironically, who hail 
directly or recently through their lineage from devel­
oping and non-Western countries,” she wrote. “Most 
disturbingly, his choice of victim precisely parallel the 
very countries’ consent he purports, in his well-known 
academic theory, to defend as invalid in light of human 
rights abuses.” 

The race dimension exacerbated the already uneven 
power dynamics between Pogge and his student, Lopez 
Aguilar wrote. Linda Alcoff, a Professor of Philosophy 
at Hunter College who signed the open letter, said that 
while one might think Pogge’s specialty would require 
him to be sensitive to intersectional identities, an 
awareness of structural injustices does not always trans­
late into an understanding of identity-based injustices. 
Professors like Pogge, she said, “take the structural stuff 
as a macro framing. It doesn’t always cause them to 
feel that they need to understand racism, sexism, het­
erosexism.”

Even if you were able to separate the question of 
Pogge’s philosophical pursuits and his behavior, she 
added, it wouldn’t make a difference. “Anybody who 
is a professor in higher education has taken on a mor­
ally bound obligation to assist his students and to do 
his scholarship with integrity and with responsibility 
to others,” she said. “That’s true whether you’re doing 
higher energy physics or ethics.”

At 86 years old, after having taught at Yale for six­
ty-one years, Harold Bloom’s complex reputation pre­
cedes him. If you believe the rumors, he’s sexist and 
inappropriate. A womanizer. But he’s also a world-re­
nowned literary critic; preeminent in his field. Bloom’s 
alleged offenses have settled behind a historical haze 
in a way that Pogge’s aren’t. Every year, students still 
jockey for spots in Bloom’s class.

“[The class] was attractive to me because one of 
the things this school professes to be is a collection of 
experts like that,” said a male junior taking Bloom’s 
course, “Poetic Influence: Shakespeare to Keats.” He 
spoke under the condition of anonymity. He had read 
Wolf’s piece before coming to Yale and, after sign­
ing the open letter condemning Pogge, also carefully 
considered the moral implications of studying under 
Bloom, who did not respond to requests for comment. 
“I was wondering, thinking about the article, not know­
ing how to let that enter in my decision matrix,” he 
recalled. How is it possible to reconcile Bloom’s pres­
tige with the specter of what he might have done?

Ultimately, he said, he outsourced the calculus to 
Yale. “There’s this tendency to politicize choice here,” 
he explained. “But if you buy into this institution—and 
you do…—to me, these questions are always a slippery 
slope.” By attending the university, he argued, stu­
dents are already complicit in funding a faculty project 
which is inherently based in a “totally gendered power 
structure.”

For men, it’s often easier to speak in abstract terms 
about the philosophical and moral implications of 
a choice like this. But for women, it’s more compli­
cated—it becomes a choice about whether you are 
willing to risk harassment yourself. 

“I’m hesitant to take any rumor as truth, but I’d

rather be safe than sorry,” said Kas Tebbetts, a freshman 
enrolled in the Political Science equivalent of Pogge’s 
lecture, also called “Intro to Political Philosophy,” but 
taught by Bryan Garsten. 

Paine, the senior who chose not to take Pogge’s class, 
was more critical. “The idea in general of having a pro­
fessor who is alleged to have preyed upon undergrad­
uates who he’s teaching makes me kind of sick,” she 
said. “Just sitting in lecture and thinking about all the 
allegations…”

Taking a class with someone who allegedly fits the 
trope of a “male cultish academic figure who feels like 
their brilliance gives them impunity, using power to 
get young women into bed,” as Alcoff described Bloom 
and Pogge, may be a risk. 

Nicole Bokat, the mother of the managing editor of 
this publication, studied at New York University in the 
1980s, when Bloom taught in the English department. 
There were rumors even then, Bokat said. “For exam­
ple, he made a comment that he was so happy to be at 
NYU because the students were so much more attrac­
tive than at Yale,” she recalled.

Bokat did not take a course with Bloom because 
their literary interests didn’t seem to align—she wanted 
to study female authors, and knew “he wouldn’t be 
interested in that”—but, she said, “in the old days, if 
you couldn’t take class with any sexist professors, you 
wouldn’t get your degree.”

Women that do take Pogge’s classes also have grounds 
to hesitate for professional reasons. Kagan mentioned 
a rumor that Pogge has written letters of recommen­
dation for women with whom he’s had romantic but 
not academic relationships. Regardless of whether the 
rumor is true, female graduate students who may have 
turned to Pogge for mentorship might now worry about 
how that association will damage their reputation in 
the long term.

“Yale should take a hard look at its own history in 
regard to professors like Bloom and Pogge and rethink 
the criteria of excellence,” Alcoff said. Hiring schol­
ars who have major influence or who have published 
esteemed books means little when their students can­
not work at their optimal level for fear of harassment. 
“Institutions often separate the quality question from 
the moral question, but you can’t!”

But it is no more the responsibility of women than of 
men to make a political statement in their course selec­
tion. The opportunity to study under literary or phil­
osophical genius is attractive to many—so of course, 
some female students have considered these professors’ 
reputations and chosen to take their classes anyway.

I counted five female students in Pogge’s “Global 
Financial Integrity,” and at least three in “Intro to Polit­
ical Philosophy.” The five I asked declined to speak 
with me. Only men would comment.

“Although there may be questions about morality, 
that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from them, espe­
cially if they have shown themselves to be very good 
at teaching,” said Miles Betterson, a sophomore taking 
Pogge’s lecture. “I did debate over taking it or not, but 
the be all end all was: I’m going to learn a lot.” Besides, 
he needs the humanities credit, and another section 
didn’t work.

 Jacob Malinowski, a freshman, agreed. “I don’t 
endorse anything he’s done in his personal life, and I 
don’t condone the allegations. I just think the class is 
interesting.”

When I ask Gaurav Pathak why he chose to take 
Pogge’s “Global Financial Integrity,” he was quick to 
defend his decision. Pogge’s an incredible speaker, an 
esteemed scholar—and he is only one of three co-lec­
turers who team-teach the course (the other two are 
professionals from Price Waterhouse Cooper and 
McKinsey). “He’s practically a section participant,” 
Pathak said.

Of the nine female students who have taken or are 
taking Bloom’s class I contacted, none agreed to speak 
on the record.

Should a vegetarian boycott a professor for eating 
meat? Should monogamists avoid learning from an 
adulterer? These hypothetical comparisons are pithy 
and easy to swallow. And they miss the point.

The idea of boycotting a class based on a professor’s 
beliefs might seem counter to the project of a liberal 
arts institution, a place that’s supposed to challenge 
assumptions and shape informed, reflective opin­
ions through exposure to dissenting discourse. Taking 
classes from professors whose politics differ from one’s 
own expands these boundaries—as does, one could 
argue, taking a class from a professor whose lifestyle or 
personal choices seem distasteful. 

But here, the stakes are different; higher. The ques­
tion of whether to take a class from one of these pro­
fessors is not always an abstract moral choice. It’s also 
a very concrete question of a teacher’s power over his 
students, and whether or not you can learn from some­
one who might abuse that power in the classroom. 

Either way, it’s impossible to remove the burden of 
individual responsibility. If no one showed up to “Intro 
to Political Philosophy” on the first day of shopping 
period, Pogge wouldn’t be teaching a class.
