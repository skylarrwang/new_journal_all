EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:

It begins with an email. It’s from mailman.yale.
edu, so it misses the spam filter and goes straight to 
your inbox. You get the notification during seminar, 
and you’re sitting right next to the professor, so for 
the next hour it sits there, unopened, unanswered. 
You hope that it might be your Lit professor getting 
back to you about her office hours, or maybe word 
on that internship you applied to last month. 
Out of class, you pull out your phone and open 
it. “Welcome Newbies!!” reads the subject. That’s 
funny, you think. You don’t think you signed up for 
anything. You open it. Your eyes glaze over—it’s 
just a generic welcome email from some unnamed 
organization, full of quasi-ironic green Comic Sans 
and GIFs of Ron Swanson throwing up or whatever. 
You delete the email and go on with your day.


I don’t send anything for the next two weeks. 
That’d be too easy. You’d catch on to the game. But 
soon enough, in that same seminar, at that same 
time, you get an email from the same address. You 
give it a glance. It’s worse than the last one: you 
don’t really read the content, but you can see that 
the Comic Sans is orange now and much larger, 
and all the GIFs are from that one episode of 
Pokémon that gave all those kids seizures. That’s in 
rather poor taste, you think. Maybe I’ll unsubscribe. 
So you do. You get two confirmation emails. 
Cool. You feel a rush of power. You feel as if you’ve 
won.


Nope. You’re wrong. Next week, same time, 
another email. Okay. You’re gonna read the god­
damn thing for once.
Hi all!
WHAT UP from the CROW’S NEST, all 
you smarmy scriveners! Hope everyone 
is having a stellar week!
Just a quick reminder: SlorpF.E.S.T. is 
COMING UP THIS WEDNESDAY AT 
2 A.M.!!!!1!!!1! Remember to get your 
tickets and background checks NOW, 
because they’re going fast!
It goes on like this for a few weeks.


You unsubscribe again, but you’re starting to 
get more than a little weirded out. You email the 
IT department. Hey, you ask. Is there any way to 
remove me from this panlist? They won’t take me off.


Sunday night. You’re asleep. You’ve got class in 
a few hours. You hear a buzz. In the matchstick 
moonlight filtering through the blinds, you groggily 
reach for your phone. 
“Newbies: OMG GET YOUR DRESS SLACKS 
NOW!” reads the subject line.


Without even thinking, you throw the phone 
across the room, and it shatters.


The next morning, you’re picking up the shards 
of glass, trying to figure out what the hell about 
this is making you so angry. Fuck, you think, it’s 
everything. Those rainbow fonts. The unrelent­
ing onslaught of pointless cutesiness. Those fuck­
ing GIFs from TV shows you’re pretty sure never 
existed and also from Friends. Truly, God need not 
create Hell, you think; man has made it for himself. 
On the way to the bathroom, you step on a piece 
of glass from your phone’s screen. It goes right 
through your foot.


You come back from the emergency room. 
You’ve already missed two classes today, and you’ve 
got three papers due in the next two weeks, so you 
know you’d better get to work.


In your inbox are six new emails. Five from the 
panlist; one from IT.
Dear sir, the last reads, Thank you for contacting 
Yale Information Technology services with your con­
cern. However, removing a student from a mailing 
list is up to the discretion of the student organization 
sending the emails. 


So you open one of the goddamn things. You scan 
for an email address to send a message to, someone 
to yell at. Zilch. It’s just you and mailman.yale.edu. 
Did you try unsubscribing from the panlist? the 
IT email asks. You nearly break your laptop, too.


The emails come every hour now. Not at regular 
intervals. Sometimes there’s a gap long enough to 
make you think that maybe the deluge has stopped. 
Then you relax—big fucking mistake.


Now the messages include your name. Some of 
the emails start with it. They’re just vague enough 
that they could conceivably be form emails. But 
just. 


Your friends are getting tired of you asking them 
about who’s behind this panlist. I don’t know, says 
Esmé. Maybe it’s a religious thing? Fucking Carl 
asks why you don’t just unsubscribe, so you punch 
him right in his pudgy face in the middle of your 
Politics of Knowledge in Latin America seminar.


Another month. Maybe two. You can barely tell 
any more. You can barely sleep these nights. The 
GIFs begin to follow you into your dreams. I’m 
creative and fun and quirky! they say. I epitomize 
millennial vapidity! Don’t you just think I’m the 
fucking greatest?!


Then came the first email you missed, but Jesus, 
was it a doozy. From your ER&M prof. We need 
to discuss your paper, it said, you found out later. 
You never made the connection, because you 
stopped checking your inbox. This happens a few 
times. You’d know your grades were dropping if you 
checked your emails.


You’re isolated. You don’t look at your texts any 
more after someone added you to this inscrutable 
group message called “THE SCROD SQUAD 
;););)”. Oh God, you think. It escaped the email 
server.


You miss class. You aren’t eating enough. One 
night, you claw the modem out of the wall in a fit 
of madness.


Sometimes, you try to sleep and all you can hear 
is the MIDI version of “Trap Queen” that they 
attached to one of the emails. More than once, you 
watch the sun rise on another weary day, your trem­
bling hands clutching the blanket, and all you can 
think is, Shit, did I miss SlorpF.E.S.T.?


When ExComm finally comes calling about your 
failing grades, they know well enough to visit in 
person.
—
Next September. You’re back home, living at 
your parents’ house. You’re stable. You’re doing 
fine. You work part-time as a barista. The medica­
tion is working. Everything is just A-okay. There are 
at least some days when you don’t vomit the second 
you see WordArt.


You’ve applied to a couple of new schools. 
Explained that you had a nervous breakdown but 
you’re doing much better. You should be hearing 
back about now, you think. So, you check your 
email.


The subject reads: “OMFFFFFFFFFG NEW­
BEEZZZZ WELCOME!!”


And as you lie there on the floor, convulsing 
in fits of agony, you will think, finally, of the mist 
along the hedges that day near the coast. You will 
think of the blood, the face you barely glanced at. 
The name you never cared about.


You will know now what you should have known 
long ago: that sometimes, the dead don’t die. 
That sometimes they merely transmigrate into a 
semi-nonsensical string of cat memes and garish 
slang and ceaseless invitations to stop by a pitch 
meeting. That the unsubscribe button is just a cruel 
trick, like a knife to the back or shopping period. 
That this is your life now. That you are condemned 
to my world of ceaseless badgering and sub-Upwor­
thy attempts at hip twentysomething humor for all 
eternity. That you will forever suffer my revenge.
