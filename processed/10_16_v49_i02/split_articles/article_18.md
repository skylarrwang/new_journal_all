THE  NEW  JOURNAL
It’s an argument made by many prominent conser­
vatives across the country. Politicians like Nebraska 
Senator Ben Sasse and former presidential candidate 
Jeb Bush are refusing to vote for Trump while claiming 
that they represent the true values of the Republican 
Party. It’s an argument that could play well here on 
campus, too, where a Yale Daily News survey of the 
Class of 2020 showed that just 5 percent said they sup­
ported Trump; in 2012, a survey by the News showed 
15 percent said they supported Mitt Romney. Yale’s 
William F. Buckley Program, which was founded in 
2010 to promote intellectual diversity on campus and 
is known for inviting right-leaning speakers to campus, 
conducted a national poll that found only 19 percent 
of four-year college students support Trump, compared 
to 42 percent who say they’ll vote for Clinton. But the 
New Republicans are looking beyond campus to insist 
that they can play a role in redefining the GOP. Even 
in an insular environment like Yale, they believe their 
fight is a fight for the soul of the party and the country.
“If, say, in four or eight years we continue nominat­
ing people like Donald Trump and continue down this 
very dark path, I’ll have to leave the Republican Party,” 
said Benjamin Rasmussen, a junior and New Republi­
cans co-chair. “But there is hope. There is hope. We’re 
not out of time yet. We’ll stay with the party, if we’re 
bringing it back to the party of Reagan. But I don’t 
know. The future is very uncertain.” 

The problem is that it’s not clear what, if anything, 
the New Republicans and their conservative compatri­
ots can do to influence the voters that this election has 
revealed and emboldened. The increasingly vocal alt-
right has claimed Pepe the Frog as its unofficial mas­
cot, subjected journalists to anti-Semitic trolling on 
Twitter, and turned a hypothetical wall into a proud 
symbol of nativism. Even beyond the alt-right, many 
Trump voters rage against the elitism and arrogance of 
Washington, and it seems unlikely that anyone with the 
New Republicans’ approach and Ivy League pedigree 
will be able to squash them—or convince them of the 
wisdom of small government principles and overt out­
reach to non-white voters—after November 8.

In Fitzgerald’s common room, Luntz ceded the 
screen to Lester Holt, Clinton and Trump. Soon, 
Trump was proclaiming that the housing crash was good 
business and  not paying taxes made him smart while 
Clinton whipped out a too-cute line about “Trumped 
Up Trickle Down” economics. The New Republicans 
uncorked a bottle of Woodbridge white wine. They 
laughed at some moments, but they also spent a lot of 
time with their heads in their hands. Funny this was 
not. They are still Republicans, and Trump is too. 

Less than a year ago, to many Americans, Republi­
cans, and students on this campus, Trump was funny. 
Rasmussen, a Global Affairs major from the Bay Area 
who says he’s used to being one of the few conservatives 
in the classroom, was studying abroad in Russia when 
Trump rode a golden escalator down to his presidential 
announcement speech in June 2015. Rasmussen says 
he “laughed out loud.” But then Trump’s poll numbers 
spiked and stayed high, and Rasmussen started to get 
nervous. Something was happening in the Republican 
Party that he didn’t understand. 

When he got back to campus, the Yale College Repub­
licans weren’t doing much. The primaries started, and 
Trump won New Hampshire, and then South Caro­
lina, and then a slew of states on Super Tuesday. The 
College Republicans held a debate watch party during 
the primaries, but only board members came. 
“We had all this Popeyes chicken and only like five 
people were there,” Rasmussen recalls. 

No one in the organization supported Trump in the 
primary, according to Rasmussen and Fitzgerald, but

as the months wore on and one candidate after the 
other fell by the wayside, the group began to discuss 
what they would do in the event of Trump’s nomi­
nation. Early on, there was a division between those 
who disliked Trump but thought he would be better 
than any Democrat, and those who would not support 
Trump under any circumstances. Fitzgerald was espe­
cially disturbed by what he saw at Trump’s rallies; as 
a black man, he says, he would be wary of attending 
one even if he loved Trump. When the semester ended 
and summer began, some Republicans on campus and 
across the country were still hoping for a successful 
eleventh-hour challenge to Trump at the Republican 
National Convention. It didn’t happen. 

After the Harvard Republican Club announced in 
early August that it would not be endorsing Trump, the 
Yale College Republican board members—including 
Rasmussen; Fitzgerald; Gabriel; sophomore Jay Mon­
dal; and co-presidents Emmy Reinwald, a senior, and 
Michaela Cloutier, a junior—convened for a discus­
sion via GroupMe about what to do next. They decided 
that while it was inappropriate to release an official 
repudiation of Trump, they didn’t need to endorse him, 
and Gabriel made the point that doing so could turn off 
potential new members and compromise other work, 
like campaigning for down-ballot candidates such as 
Senator Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire. “We reached 
a compromise between those who hated him and those 
who felt they had an obligation to the party,” Gabriel 
recalls. 

This strategy of staying quiet and hoping no one 
asked directly seemed viable, Fitzgerald said, because 
the College Republicans are such a small group, with 
three board members at the start of this year and about 
six people who attend events. As Reinwald and Clout­
ier would later point out in an article they published 
on The Tab about their endorsement of Trump, before 
August 8 the Facebook page had just forty-eight likes. 
(The Yale College Democrats have over 1,700.)

But a week later, the College Republicans GroupMe 
blew up again: Someone had created a fake Twitter 
account and posted the message, “The Yale College 
Republicans will not be supporting Donald Trump in 
the fall. More information to come.”

Gabriel, checking Overheard at Yale from Boston, 
watched news about the Twitter account attract com­
ments asking if the tweet was true. “Things sort of 
snowballed,” Gabriel says, but he still thought the sit­
uation could be resolved with a neutral statement that 
said nothing about Trump while criticizing the imper­
sonation and theft of the College Republicans’ logo. 
But the co-presidents saw it differently. They felt the 
situation demanded a show of vocal support for Trump, 
and by the time they told the other board members 
what they were doing, their statement was already up 
on Facebook. It was shared over two hundred times. 
“While not every member of our organization sup­
ported Trump in the primary, as an organization and 
branch of the GOP we support Republicans up and 
down the ballot,” it read in part. “And yes, that includes 
supporting Donald Trump for president.”

Rasmussen was on the subway in New York as the 
events unfolded, and when he got off, the endorsement 
was up. He and the other future New Republicans 
tried to persuade Reinwald and Cloutier to revise the 
statement, but they refused. Individual board mem­
bers could post their own comments on Facebook, the 
co-presidents said, but the official stance of the Yale 
College Republicans was that Trump should be the 
next president of the United States. 

Rasmussen, who founded an organization called the 
American Patriots Club at his high school, says he had 
joined the College Republicans because he wanted 
to advance the cause of conservative politics on cam­
pus. He felt the Trump endorsement would make that 
impossible. “We’d be forever branded, not as conser­
vatives or Republicans, which already has negative 
connotation on this campus,” he said, “but as Trump 
supporters.”

Fitzgerald, Rasmussen, Gabriel, and Mondal told 
Reinwald and Cloutier they were resigning. (They 
reached out to the last board member, sophomore Ben 
Zollinger, but he said he supported the endorsement 
and would keep his position.) They considered trying 
to impeach the two co-presidents, but the organiza­
tion’s constitution provided no process for that. Rein­
wald and Cloutier declined to comment for this story; 
one College Republican I approached in person said 
he saw “no necessity to give interviews to the main­
stream media.” (I asked to talk with them again after 
it became clear that Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” 
video was reshaping the race and the national chair­
man of the College Republicans announced she would 
not vote for Trump. Reinwald replied, “We’re not com­
menting.”)

Among the ex–board members, the idea of starting 
an anti-Trump Republican organization took shape. 
Within days, Fitzgerald had built a website and the 
group had drafted a statement. They emailed Clout­
ier and Reinwald to explain what they were doing, and 
then they went live with a Facebook post. The Wall 
Street Journal, Politico, and Breitbart picked up the 
story. Rasmussen appeared on Fox News to argue with 
Ryan Fournier, the National Chairman of Students 
for Trump, a big-haired, smooth-faced North Carolin­
ian who said the New Republicans were throwing the

election to Clinton. Rasmussen countered that he was 
helping to “save the Republican Party from its eventual 
collapse.” 

Various right-wing sites also wrote about the New 
Republicans. USA Politics Today called them “appall­
ing,” while the Gateway Pundit (“Where Hope Finally 
Made A Comeback”) declared them “sick.” As of early 
October, the Yale New Republicans’ sole Facebook 
post—their introductory message—had attracted fif­
ty-six likes, as well as comments from people with no 
apparent Yale affiliation. “You are a disgrace to our 
country and party,” wrote a man named Phillip Hefner.

Rasmussen dismissed the backlash as a sign that 
the New Republicans were on the right track. But the 
online hate also seemed to reflect a disturbing revela­
tion of this election cycle: There is little respect left 
between the GOP voters who anointed Trump their 
nominee and the party elite. A group of earnest Yale 
kids who think they know what’s best for America made 
a satisfying stand-in punching bag for The Establish­
ment. 

The reaction on campus, however, has been largely 
positive. The New Republicans share articles writ­
ten about them on their Facebook page and say they 
received emails from incoming freshmen even before 
the semester started. But Rasmussen, a first-gener­
ation college student whose mother is a mail carrier 
and whose father is a house painter, hasn’t told his dad 
about his new extracurricular. His father has been a 
Trump supporter from the very beginning of the cam­
paign. Rasmussen does, though, talk about the New 
Republicans with his grandfather, who’s a somewhat 
less dedicated Trump supporter. The conversations 
aren’t exactly cheerful.

“He thinks I’m dividing the party. He thinks I’m 
giving in to Hillary,” Rasmussen says. “He thinks that 
if we don’t elect Trump, then the Republican Party’s 
doomed. But if we do elect Trump, the Republican 
Party’s more doomed.” While Rasmussen was busy try­
ing to build a space for right-leaning Yalies who hate 
Trump, he had to communicate across a growing frac­
ture between himself and the people back home.

Yale is a liberal campus, but the undergraduate com­
munity is dotted with conservative organizations: the 
Yale Political Union’s Party of the Right, the Federal­
ist Party, the Tory Party, and the Conservative Party; 
the Yale Free Press; the Objectivist Study Group; and, 
since 2010, the well-funded, non-profit and non-parti­
san William F. Buckley Program. Last year, the Buckley 
Program boasted 174 student fellows (including Rein­
wald, Cloutier, Rasmussen, and Gabriel; Fitzgerald is 
applying this year) who attend events and dinners with 
speakers. Unlike the College Republicans and now the 
New Republicans, these organizations are devoted pri­
marily to discussing ideas, not to electoral activism. 

At a recent reception held by the Buckley Program 
at The Study, this preference for high-minded prin­
ciples was on full display. Buckley was celebrating its 
reprinting of the 1975 Woodward Report, which laid 
out a strong institutional commitment to free speech. 
The remarks of federal appellate judge José Cabranes, 
who got his law degree from Yale in 1965, didn’t sound 
totally un-Trumpian—he criticized political correct­
ness and the implementation of a shadowy universe of 
federally-mandated sexual assault bureaucracy on col­
lege campuses—but chants of “Build the wall!” would 
have elicited gasps and stares. Before Cabranes spoke, 
guests mingled beside an open bar while waiters passed 
cosmopolitan trays of potstickers and falafel balls.  

The election has been a topic of consternation across 
Yale’s conservative intellectual circles. (The Federalist 
Party recently held a debate on the topic “Conserva­
tives have no party.”) Abhay Rangray, a sophomore and 
prospective Buckley Fellow in a suit and red tie whom 
I had met at the New Republicans’ debate watch party, 
said the whole spectacle was a sign that America’s 
democracy was devolving into European politics, with 
the Democratic Party edging towards Communism and 
the Republican Party towards nationalism. 

“I hope this is a temporary shift, and after the era of 
Trump we can return to conservatism,” Rangray said. 
“But it’s frightening because Trump’s success shows 
that old-school values are not shared by many Repub­
lican voters.”

Conservatives in the Buckley Program, like the New 
Republicans, tend to wax poetic about those old-school 
values. They’re the values of the Program’s namesake: 
the founder of the National Review, the twentieth cen­
tury’s leading American conservative intellectual, and 
a member of Yale’s class of 1950. Just before graduat­
ing from Yale, Buckley wrote God and Man at Yale, 
a critique of secularism and liberalism at the univer­
sity. Lauren Noble, who founded the program as a 
Yale senior in 2010 and is now the executive director, 
describes Buckley Conservatism as a principled oppo­
sition to the expansion of the state’s role in public life. 
She and senior Josh Altman, president of the Buckley 
Program, say that true conservatism also rejects rac­
ism. William F. Buckley, they note, helped to purge 
anti-Semitism from the party. (He also criticized the 
Civil Rights Movement and wrote in a National Review 
editorial that “the White community in the South is 
entitled to take such measures as are necessary to pre­
vail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does 
not predominate numerically.” Noble says that the
