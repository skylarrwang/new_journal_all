CAMERA LUCIDA
John Chirikjian takes a photo every day 
Catherine Peng
On his 784th day at Yale, John Chirikjian takes a 
picture of me in the bustling Branford dining hall. 
His camera is pressed close to his chest, and his dark 
eyes narrow. Then comes the click. Chirikjian pauses 
to compare this photo to the ten he has already taken 
today and to the thousands he has taken during three-
plus years at Yale. He won’t show me the shot before he 
leaves, tucking his camera to his side, but hours later I 
will find my own photo online, where anyone can see 
it.

Chirikjian always knows precisely how many days 
he has been at Yale, because since the beginning of 
his freshman year he has taken a photograph every day 
and posted it in a public Facebook album (titled “‘Take 
it Slow’ ~ Dean Loge,” referring to the former Dean 
of Timothy Dwight college). The most recent photo 
when we spoke was the sixteenth photo of Chirikjian’s 
senior fall and the 783rd in the collection. A computer 
science major in Timothy Dwight—the site of his very 
first photo entry— Chirikjian began the project to 
share his college experience with his parents. Posting 
photos online, where friends and family expect to see 
them, keeps him accountable. 

Chirikjian’s photos are meant to resemble a shared 
diary account of everyday life on campus. From his first 
breathless still taken on August 24, 2013 to a shot of 
a colorful summer night under the lights of Ashley’s 
Ice Cream Shop shop on September 16, 2016—the 
day before we spoke—Chirkijian’s photos are touching 
not only because of the moments they capture, but also 
because of their consistency. The album displays his 
meticulous devotion to Yale, shot by shot. 

 “Every once in a while when I’m feeling sentimen­
tal, I’ll go through all the photos,” says Jordan Plotner, 
his close friend and freshman-year roommate. It’ll 
always bring me to this place of timeless nostalgia.”

There are moments in the album that could belong 
to any Yale student—photos such as Harkness (#166), 
Questionably Necessary Bag Checks At Bass Library 
(#432), HalloWoads (#569)—but there are also pho­
tos so personal that they might be best understood by 
close friends, or Chirikjian alone. There are his New 
Haircuts (#466), his Mustache Parties (#269), his Suite 
Teethbrushing (#194). His closest friends sparkle in 
these photos, pulling viewers into scenes that they have 
not experienced. It feels strange and intrusive to study 
these photos as an outsider to Chirikjian’s private life—
to feel a false nostalgia for another’s memory as you 
click through the collection.

I need to ask for an explanation from Plotner on the 
Attempts to Bleach Hair w/ Teeth-Whitening Tooth­
paste (#467), for instance, which captures the reflec­
tion of Chirikjian’s suitemates gathered in a bathroom 
mirror, blow-drying their hair. “That pretty much sums 
up sophomore year,” he tells me. “Mev and Lukas dyed 
their hair blonde, Mev shaved his head, and Lukas 
tried to change his hair color with toothpaste. I was a 
somewhat passive bystander and Chirikjian was taking 
the photo. It’s an odd scene in which every single one 
of us is doing something that doesn’t make sense.”

Chirkijian insists that he doesn’t mind whether the 
pictures are popular in a social space or whether they 
rack up likes from peers. “I’m a social media whore…
but I like to think that I’d choose a more intimate scene 
if it better represents the day,” Chirikjian says. He 
refuses to plan his successive shots, and takes several 
each day in search of the perfect candid.

Though he speaks of capturing intimacy, it often 
escapes him. Even the grainier iPhone photos that dot 
the album are tweaked for color balance, straining for 
faithfulness to reality. 	

“Ideally, every one of this 
series would be a candid scene,” he says. “But more 
often than not, if you pull a camera out, even if it’s just 
a phone, people become instantly aware of it.”

When Chirikjian takes my photo, I think about this 
authenticity. I know he is looking for a natural pose, 
but I can’t stop myself from smoothing the hair near my
