I was the shadow of the Kookaburra
hanging on my windowpane.
The glass superimposed
my toothless smile onto
the blue crescent of his wing.
When his eyes overlapped mine,
I revealed my teeth in laughter,
and he echoed me in a round.
I laughed louder; he cackled
and called me insane,
But I was the shadow
of the Kookaburra slain.
Kookaburra sits on a rusty nail
but where is the hammer,
where is the axe that turned the old gum tree
into the window frame.
Oh how life can be.
