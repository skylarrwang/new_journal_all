NEW HAVEN IS REFOCUSING ITS EFFORTS TO TACKLE
 HOMELESSNESS.  IS  THAT  ENOUGH?

There’s a ritual every Sunday afternoon on the 
New Haven Green. For the past nine years, rain or 
shine, volunteers have set up a small altar behind Trin­
ity Church on the Green, complete with an altar cloth, 
communion chalice, and Bible. They unfold a dozen 
wooden chairs. A self-appointed drummer sits down, 
flips over a plastic container, begins playing a beat, 
and a congregation of homeless people arrives for the 
Chapel on the Green.

On a cold afternoon at the end of September, the 
oldest participants fill the rows of chairs, while the rest 
stand in a semicircle around the altar, bags of their pos­
sessions at their feet. One man lies down on the grass, 
hand on his stomach, looking up at the trees. The rec­
tor welcomes the crowd and begins reading a Bible pas­
sage, raising her voice over the sound of city buses rum­
bling down Chapel Street. The crowd listens quietly.

When the service ends, the crowd lines up for the 
most vital part of the event: a free Sunday lunch. Each 
week, a different local church sponsors the Chapel on 
the Green, providing their rector for the service and 
over 150 bagged lunches containing sandwiches and 
snacks. The line, nearly one hundred people long, 
consists almost entirely of young or middle-aged black 
men. Some leave immediately after receiving food, 
while others congregate in small groups across the 
Green to eat.

One of the attendees is Harold Fox, who has lived 
on the New Haven Green since the beginning of July. 
He sleeps on a bench, sitting upright, his backpack at 
his feet and worn suitcase by his side. When it rains, 
he sleeps under the awning of a bus stand on Chapel 
Street. But he never really sleeps. Even in the dead of 
night, the Green is alive with activity, and he dozes for 
an hour or two at most.

Nine weeks ago, Fox, an affable 47-year-old New 
Haven native with short hair and a thin beard, had an 
apartment and a steady job. Monday through Friday, 
he worked 16-hour shifts at the Yale-New Haven Hos­
pital sterilizing surgical instruments, a job he had held 
for nine years. But when he got into an argument with 
his supervisor, he was fired. At first, he held onto his 
apartment, though making rent soon became difficult. 
Then, he became convinced that someone was snoop­
ing around his home at night. Fearing for his safety, he 
gathered his remaining possessions and left.

Fox is now one of the roughly one hundred unshel­
tered homeless people who spend their nights in New 
Haven’s streets, parks, and abandoned buildings. That 
population seems to have surged in the city recently, 
casting a shadow over the progress that state and fed­
eral governments say they have made in the past two 
years. Since Fox only just lost his home, he is consid­
ered “transitionally homeless,” and thus is not the pri­
ority of federal and statewide efforts, which focus on 
housing the “chronically homeless,” people with dis­
abilities who have been homeless for over a year.

Jason Martinez manages the Coordinated Access 
Network (CAN), a federally-mandated shared data­
base of homeless people, for United Way of Greater 
New Haven, a social service provider. He said the New 
Haven area has been housing the chronically homeless 
with unprecedented efficiency. “Last year, it took two 
and a half years to house the chronically homeless,” he 
said. “Now, it takes 100 days.”

Before the CAN, homeless people had to inquire at 
each shelter for an available bed. Now, they can call 
2-1-1 and be entered into the system, which allows 
local service providers to connect them with available 
resources, case managers, and a place to sleep. The 
CAN helps reduce favoritism at shelters, and prioritizes 
support for the chronically homeless, whom the federal 
government deems the most vulnerable.

The state of Connecticut has been a national leader 
of homeless reduction initiatives. In January 2015, 
Connecticut joined Zero: 2016, a national campaign 
that is trying to meet the goals of the Obama Admin­
istration to end veteran’s homelessness by the end of 
2015 and chronic homelessness by the end of 2016. 
Zero: 2016 includes over 400 member organizations 
responsible for coordinating homeless services in city, 
county, metropolitan, or statewide areas. And to track 
its own progress, Zero: 2016 requires that each branch 
conduct an annual “Point-In-Time Count” (PIT), a 
laborious data-gathering method that requires sending 
volunteers into streets and shelters to count the num­
ber of homeless people they find on a single night.

In May, when the Connecticut Coalition to End 
Homelessness (CCEH) released its PIT data, the state­
wide results were encouraging. Across Connecticut, 
homelessness had dropped thirteen percent since 2007. 
Chronic homelessness had dropped twenty percent in 
only a year, on track with the targets of Zero: 2016. 
And last year, to much fanfare, the state declared the 
elimination of veteran’s homelessness; there is now a 
system in place to ensure that homeless veterans, once 
identified by service providers, secure housing within 
ninety days.

In New Haven, however, even as service providers 
pool their resources to fight homelessness, there is little 
agreement about the most basic fact: whether home­
lessness is rising or falling in the city. The New Haven 
PIT reported 625 homeless people, including 138 
children. That number was lower than it has been in 
the past, but it was a ten percent increase since 2015. 
The rate of chronic homeless showed no significant 
decrease within the past year. And most worrisome of 
all, there was a fifty-two percent increase in the city’s 
unsheltered homeless population from last year alone.

Yet despite the concerning data, service providers 
in New Haven are optimistic that they can eliminate 
chronic homelessness in the city by the end of this year 
— and eventually, homelessness altogether.

“I definitely think it’s possible to end homelessness,” 
said John Bradley, the Executive Director of Liberty 
Community Services, a New Haven-based homeless 
service provider. “We’re not talking about ending pov­
erty, we’re not talking about getting everyone educated. 
We’re just talking about 500 people sleeping on the 
street. It can be done.” As Bradley explained, eliminat­
ing chronic homelessness will make more resources 
available to the transitionally homeless, which would 
enable New Haven to eliminate homelessness entirely.

But the current emphasis on ending chronic home­
lessness means that transitionally homeless people like 
Harold are at risk of falling through the cracks. Since 
Fox has only been homeless for nine weeks, he is not 
even represented by the PIT. And because he has not 
yet entered a shelter or worked with a case manager, 
he is not part of the CAN. He lives on the Green in 
a limbo between the home he had not long ago and 
the shelter that, due to fears of bedbugs and a sense 
of principled independence, he hopes to avoid for as 
long as possible. He remains optimistic that soon he 
will find a job and an apartment. But the strain of the 
past few months shows in his weary, drooping eyes and 
the ragged edge of his voice.

Fox spends his days walking to soup kitchens across 
New Haven for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and 
attends the Chapel on the Green on Sundays. He has 
a slow, lurching gait, a combination of the weight of 
his luggage and a limp he acquired after being hit by 
a car years ago. In the morning, he goes to the Pow­
erhouse Gym in North Haven so that he can exercise 
and shower. (He has enough money to keep his mem­
bership until the end of the year.) And each night, he 
returns to a bench on the Green to sleep under the 
glow of a streetlamp. 

“Eventually I’ll get myself out of here,” he says.

For federal and local governments, ending homeless­
ness is as much a financial concern as it is a humani­
tarian one. The longer someone is homeless, the more 
they cycle through expensive public systems like hos­
pitals, jails, and emergency services. According to the 
Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness (CCEH), 
eliminating homelessness could save up to seventy per­
cent of the cost of those public resources.

But in their fight to end homelessness, service pro­
viders in New Haven and across the country face formi­
dable challenges. Limited employment opportunities, 
stagnant wages, the opioid crisis, and the rising cost of 
living continue to push people into homelessness or 
prevent them from returning to permanent housing. 
Since the causes of homelessness are complex and per­
vasive, victories are ephemeral.

The homeless are a transient population. People 
move from place to place, arrive and leave shelters, 
and try to hold onto permanent housing. As a result, 
tracking rates of homelessness over time can be almost 
impossible, even with systems like the PIT. Commu­
nity leaders who volunteer in the PIT are quick to 
note its flaws. But the confusion sits deeper. Many city 
officials and homeless service providers say there is no 
clear consensus about whether homelessness is on the 
rise in New Haven, or if the disturbing data is caused 
by random variation.

Martha Okafor, the Community Services Admin­
istrator for New Haven — a branch of City Hall that 
oversees city community service providers — empha­
sized that the PIT count is inherently unreliable.

“It’s not a total count, because at that point in time, 
you count all the people you can reach. We don’t get to 
every place, and we only get the people we can see. We 
may not reach every person,” she said. Fox, for exam­
ple, had a job and an apartment when this year’s PIT 
was conducted.

Lisa Tepper Bates, the Executive Director of the 
CCEH, said the weather of the count night could sig­
nificantly influence the data. On bitterly cold nights, 
people may go to greater lengths to find shelter, result­
ing in a lower unsheltered population; last year’s PIT 
was conducted during a blizzard, she said. Warmer 
temperatures tend to correlate with higher unsheltered 
counts, as was the case this January. 

Bradley said that the opening of a warming shelter at 
Bethel AME Church on Goffe Street this past winter 
might also have increased this year’s high unsheltered 
count, since people there, who might not have been 
even counted before, were recorded as unsheltered. 
Some, like Tepper Bates, argue that this year’s uptick 
may not be representative of a larger trend. Another 
provider said that even with the PIT and her organiza­
tion’s own data,  “we just don’t know.”

But Bradley said that the potential increase does 
concern him, and that his organization has seen higher 
demand recently. Sunrise Café, a free breakfast pro­
