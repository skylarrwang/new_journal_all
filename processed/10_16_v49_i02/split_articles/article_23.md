THE  NEW  JOURNAL
gram Liberty Community Services runs out of a church 
in Wooster Square, has seen more participants between 
this summer and last winter. And for the first time ever, 
there are waitlists for its housing programs, though that 
is partly because calling 2-1-1 makes it easier for people 
to request access, Bradley explained.

Okafor, who manages the $1.1 million that the city 
allocates to homeless service providers in New Haven, 
was even more adamant. She explained that the data 
from the Homeless Management Information System, 
a federal system that centralizes data from local provid­
ers, indicates a homeless population in the city that far 
exceeds the PIT count.
“Oh yes, homelessness is on the rise,” she said.

Though faced with uncertainty and disagreement 
about the state of homelessness in the city, most service 
providers are cautiously optimistic that they can elim­
inate New Haven’s chronic homelessness by the end 
of this year. And there is a strong impetus to do so: as 
Tepper Bates argued, the chronically homeless are the 
people most likely to die if they are not housed. 

But Okafor pointed out that the intense focus on 
housing the chronically homeless diverts attention 
away from the largest population, the transitionally 
homeless, who may have only recently lost their homes 
and now are struggling to get by. 
“The conversation has centered on this very small 
population, and you lose sight of the larger population 
of people who are homeless, which is growing,” she 
said. “We’re not paying attention to them.”

Although Fox has both a mental and physical disabil­
ity – schizoaffective disorder and a permanently dam­
aged leg – he is not considered chronically homeless 
because he has not yet been homeless for a year. He is 
not a priority for the federal or the city government. As 
Fox grapples with the reality of his new life, he is striv­
ing to inform himself about the landscape of resources 
available to him.

Like most homeless people in New Haven, Fox has 
the schedule of free meals around the city memorized; 
they determine the course of his day. Depending on 
the day of the week, he gets breakfast at Sunrise Café, 
Amistad in the Hill neighborhood, St. Paul’s Chapel, 
or the Community Soup Kitchen on Broadway. He 
gets lunch there too, or at the Saint Ann Soup Kitchen. 
For dinner, he heads to the Downtown Evening Soup 
Kitchen on Temple Street.

Fox lives on $190 per month from food stamps, 
bumming cigarettes off other people on the Green and 
accepting the occasional dollar from passersby. He is 
petitioning for unemployment benefits, but if that does 
not work out, he plans to get a job at Hummel Brothers 
Inc., a meatpacking company in Long Wharf, which 
he has heard is always hiring. 

But Fox is qualified for a much higher-skill job. In 
his thirties, living in a housing authority apartment in 
New Haven, he went back to school at Gateway Com­
munity College. He received two Associate in Science 
degrees in hotel and food service management, and a 
certificate in culinary arts. Now, though, his daily rou­
tine has become so much about survival that he has few 
long-term plans, beyond vague hopes that he will find a 
good job and a place to live soon.
“I don’t hang out with people,” he says. “That’s how 
I got started with all this mess in the first place, trusting 
people,” he says. He says that he likes the Chapel on 
the Green for its sense of community, but he is largely 
on his own.

The rector looks up from the passage to address the 
crowd on the Green. “Jesus is saying to us, you may be 
lost sometimes, you may be the one that was taken from 
the fold, and it may not make any sense to you, but I 
see you, I will seek you out.” She opens her arms wide. 
“Those times when we don’t feel like we’re with the 
others, when others have left us behind, let us rejoice, 
for God is seeking us out.”

After the rector’s prayers, people move through the 
crowd, shaking each other’s hands and exchanging 
peace. An old man tapping a large stick: “Peace be with 
you.” A skinny young man wearing a backwards base­
ball cap, leaning against his bike: “Peace be with you.” 
A middle-aged woman with shivering hands: “Peace be 
with you.” Fox, wearing a white undershirt and cargo 
shorts, toting his suitcase: “Peace be with you.” Then, 
the rector performs the communion rites and circu­
lates through the crowd, dipping a communion wafer 
in grape juice and placing it on each person’s tongue. 
The drummer begins playing a slow beat as the crowd 
sings a mumbled version of “Amazing Grace” and, with 
increasing rhythm, slides into “We Shall Overcome.”

Rowena Kemp, the Assistant Rector of Trinity On the 
Green, which organizes the program, has worked at the 
service since 2014. She says that the size of the group 
is smallest at the beginning of the month — when peo­
ple receive SNAP benefits — and swells significantly by 
the end. Recently, she has noticed that the crowd has 
been younger and bigger.  

Fox is sharing a bench with a young man who intro­
duces himself as “Lieutenant Kendrick the Third.” He 
has glasses, cropped blonde hair and jittery knees. In 
one breath, he says that he grew up in Florida, is active 
in the U.S. army, and suffers from PTSD. 

He then points to a gaunt, shirtless man with tattoos 
across his chest sitting on the asphalt next to the bench,

whom he claims is his brother. “His name is Ghost.”

As they eat their lunch, the three men talk about the 
dangers of the Green. “People are getting shot, selling 
all kinds of drugs,” says Kendrick. “And the gangs mark 
their territory—”
“Yeah, that’s the loose cig guys,” says Fox, nodding. 
“You gotta stay safe.”
“I’ve seen more homeless out here than anywhere in 
Connecticut,” says Kendrick.

But in New Haven, he says, you can get three meals 
a day, which is why he came here.

Ghost agrees, rocking back and forth. “Trenton 
[New Jersey] is a war zone,” he says. His wife is still 
there, he says, and he wants to bring her to New Haven 
as an escape. 


Ghost is not alone. Many nearby towns do not have 
emergency shelters, which forces homeless people to 
take buses or trains to get to a city like New Haven, 
where they have a better chance of finding a bed. For 
Bradley, the influx of outsiders is an indication of New 
Haven’s success at supporting the homeless. He noted 
that New Haven is the only city in Connecticut that 
dedicates general revenue funds (business and property 
taxes) to homeless services.  But increased demand 
from newcomers also strains New Haven’s ability to 
serve its own homeless population.

At least on the ground, it seems that demand for 
homeless services has risen recently in New Haven. 
The Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen now serves 30 
more people on average than it used to. The Chapel on 
the Green has also seen its numbers rise. Each Sunday, 
new faces emerge in the crowd. One volunteer, who 
has been serving the program for the past three years, 
said that when he scans the crowd, there are only ten or 
fifteen people who consistently appear; everyone else 
is different. One of the church sextons attributed that 
fluidity to the fact that other towns actively send their 
homeless people to New Haven because the city has 
more available resources.

Even as many homeless people arrive in New Haven 
seeking immediate support, the city government is 
trying to reallocate its resources so that fewer people 
become homeless in the first place. Martha Okafor 
said that before, all of the city’s money was going into 
emergency shelters. But last year, the Community Ser­
vices Administration, which she leads, redistributed 
city funds for homeless services based on a review con­
ducted by an independent panel. Two shelters, New 
Reach and Emergency Shelter Management Services, 
lost over $100,000 in city funds. That money was given 
to other agencies for preventative measures such as 
financial help with utility bills, childcare support, and 
food stamp assistance. The city’s funds were also used 
to open Bethel AME Church’s new warming center.
 “We’re moving away from just sheltering people and 
hoping for the best,” said Tepper Bates. “We’re trying to 
focus at the front door on preventing homelessness and 
helping people leave shelters as quickly as possible.”

Homeless service providers like Liberty Community 
Services and Columbus House have programs that can 
intervene at critical moments to pay a client’s rent, pre­
vent eviction, or help them stabilize their lives before 
they lose their homes. And rapid re-housing programs 
can quickly place people in permanent housing by 
providing initial financial assistance to cover a security 
deposit, the first month’s rent, or utility bills.

As important as preventative measures are, in the 
short term, many homeless people across New Haven 
continue to rely on emergency shelters to get off the 
streets at night. Columbus House maintains a shelter 
in the Hill with about 100 beds that, depending on the 
type of program someone is a part of, can be slept in 
for one night or up to six months. In the men’s and 
women’s wings of the shelter, there are clean, well-lit 
rooms with a dozen beds reserved for emergency stays 
of up to ninety days.

But at Emergency Shelter Management Services, a 
75-bed men’s emergency shelter on Grand Avenue in 
Wooster Square, the homeless must line up each day to 
secure a bed. One Friday afternoon, roughly thirty men 
were waiting outside the shelter’s entrance at 3:30 pm,

half an hour before the shelter opened its doors, with 
more arriving every few minutes. Many of the men in 
line were quick to condemn the shelter for poor condi­
tions and a bedbug infestation.

Joshua Hoenig, a 29-year-old from a neighboring 
town, pulled up his shirt to show bed bug bites that 
ringed his stomach and covered his arms and legs. He 
said that he had just been to the hospital because of 
the bites. Doctors warned him that if he were bitten 
again, he would risk getting a blood infection. But he 
had nowhere else to go, so he was back in line.

Other men displayed bedbug bites across their bod­
ies and described bedbugs in mattresses and pillows, a 
ceiling fan that only blows dust, moldy showers, bath­
room tiles caked with grime, blankets that are never 
cleaned, unsecured storage bins, favoritism, complaints 
to the Health Department that went ignored. (Okafor 
said that there was a “moment” when the shelter had 
bed bugs, but health inspectors visited and certified 
it.) Even as the city attempts to fund preventative mea­
sures, some emergency shelters, like the one on Grand 
Avenue, seem unable to provide adequate support.

And, as Bradley pointed out, even preventative pro­
grams receive little federal funding; housing the chron­
ically homeless remains at the top of the nation’s pri­
orities.
