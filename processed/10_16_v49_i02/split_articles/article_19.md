Civil Rights Movement was not Buckley’s finest moment.)
Ultimately, 
many 
self-described 
Buckley Conservatives recognize that 
arguing amongst themselves about 
Trump’s rejection of conservatism is 
futile. 
“Everyone kept shouting, ‘Trump 
is not a conservative, Trump is not a 
conservative!’” Noble recalls of the 
primary season discourse among the 
conservative intelligentsia. “And half 
of America does not care that Trump 
is not a conservative.”

While standing near the cheese 
table before Cabranes’s remarks, I ran 
into Karl Notturno, a Buckley Fel­
low and Yale’s most famous Trump 
supporter. For over a year, he’s been 
posting Facebook statuses that support 
nearly every statement Trump makes 
and proudly wearing a TRUMP t-shirt 
around campus. He’s not involved 
with the Yale College Republicans, 
and he hasn’t officially worked for the 
Trump campaign, though he did a bit 
of phone-banking once, but if you ask 
almost anyone at Yale whether they 
know any Trump supporters in the stu­
dent body, Notturno’s name is often 
the first—and sometimes the only 
one—to come up. 

Notturno sipped a Pepsi with grena­
dine as he explained why he preferred 
Trumpism to pure conservatism. He wore a coat and 
tie, his blond hair rising in its trademark shock. A regis­
tered independent, Notturno says he’s gone through a 
political transformation since high school from liberal 
to libertarian to non-ideological. 
“Trump is far more practical than ideological,” Not­
turno said. Many conservatives at Yale, he thinks, get 
caught up in ideology and principle and fail to explain 
how those would translate to actual policy solutions. 
To cite a favorite phrase of his supporters, Trump tells 
it like it is. He doesn’t care what Bill Buckley would 
think.  

The New Republicans are betting that, moving for­
ward, they can restore conservative principles, and 
hopefully decorum, to what they believe is their rightful 
place at the forefront of the party. It’s a bet that could 
help them make electoral politics more appealing to 
conservatives at Yale, who don’t canvass and campaign 
with the gusto of liberals in the Yale College Demo­
crats. But it’s a bet that seems less tenable beyond the 
Ivory Tower.

Three weeks into the semester, the Yale New Repub­
licans held their first event of the year, an introductory 
dinner at the Branford Dining Hall. Fitzgerald and 
Rasmussen set their bags down at a long table by the 
door, retrieved plates of pasta and hamburgers, and sat 
down to wait. 

Soon a freshman in a baseball cap and red backpack 
appeared beside the table. 
“Is this the Yale New Republicans?” he asked. Fitz­
gerald and Rasmussen nodded. “What does this group 
entail? Are there meetings? Is this a meeting?” 
“This is more like a social, get-to-know-you dinner,” 
Rasmussen replied. 

The freshman, Perry Falk of La Jolla, dropped his 
bags and went to get food. Soon two other freshmen, 
Canaan Harris of northeastern Mississippi and Snigdha 
Nandipati of San Diego, arrived.

After some small talk, Rasmussen began his pitch: 
“Basically, what we plan on doing is campaigning for 
candidates who truly represent the best of the party, not 
just anyone who slaps an R next to their name.” It can 
be difficult to nail down what “the best of the party” 
really means for either major American party, but I got 
the sense from the New Republicans that they’re look­
ing for fiscal conservatism, more moderation on social 
issues, and, especially, serious efforts towards racial 
inclusivity. Few major Republican candidates hit all 
of these targets, but the New Republicans tend to like 
people like John Kasich and Marco Rubio. 

The freshmen nodded. 
“There’s also a tradition of Partisan Pong,” Rasmus­
sen continued, referring to the annual battle between 
the Yale College Republicans and the Yale College 
Democrats that takes place in the spring. “We’re going 
to try to join as a third party and win it.”

At this dining hall gathering of conservatives, the 
conversation turned not to the wisdom of the Austrian 
School of Economics or the social value of patriotism, 
but instead to the real reason everyone was there: Don­
ald Trump. They shook their heads over the infamous 
Cinco de Mayo taco bowl tweet, decried Trump’s 
refusal to firmly reject David Duke’s endorsement, 
and speculated whether this moment marks the end of 
the Republican Party or just rock bottom before it can 
make a resurgence. Fitzgerald also brought up his pes­
simism about the GOP’s ability to draw minority voters.
“It’s not because the Republican Party is racist,” Har­
ris responded. “It’s because almost all the racists are in 
the Republican Party. I wish the Party did more to say, 
‘That’s not us.’ If it isn’t us. I hope it’s not us.”

If the New Republicans’ rhetoric on Trump tends 
towards the apocalyptic, the College Republicans don’t 
seem much happier about him. Though the College 
Republican board members refused to comment for 
this story, they did invite me to their first meeting of 
the year, in a classroom in WLH one Monday evening 
in September. About ten people showed up, most of 
whom were freshmen. Reinwald and Cloutier taped up 
a flag, which kept falling off and needing to be re-taped, 
that said “College Republicans: The Best Party on 
Campus.” They passed out College Republican glasses 
and posters, which they encouraged attendees to hang 
up in their rooms to irritate their roommates. 

They broached the topic of Trump without saying 
his name, using a tone of grim resignation, and then 
moved on quickly. Calling the year “rough” for Repub­
licans, they emphasized the need to support local can­
didates. 

Reinwald also mentioned that their panlist has over 
one hundred people—a sign, she said, that Yale is 
home to more Republicans than the attendees might 
think based on the size of the meeting. Notturno told 
me the same thing about Trump voters while at the 
Buckley event: He says complete strangers sometimes 
stop him on the street to say they’ll be voting for Trump 
in November. And once you start looking beyond the 
circles of people who are actively involved in political 
groups on campus, it becomes easier to find students 
who aren’t merely grudgingly supporting Trump. 

Snigdha Nandipati, a freshman who came to the 
New Republicans dinner but said she doesn’t consider 
herself especially politically minded, supports Trump’s 
stances on immigration. Most of the outrage regard­
ing some of his comments is a result of media spin, 
she thinks, to which Trump falls victim because of his 
inexperience. The Washington Post’s release of the 
tape showing Trump talking about how he “grabbed 
[women] by the pussy” gave her some pause, but she 
was heartened by his apology during the debate two 
days later. “As a woman, I am not threatened by a cou­
ple of words that were said in a harmless casual setting 
over ten years ago,” she wrote in an email. She plans to 
vote for Trump in California. 

For several Trump supporters on campus, how­
ever, the release of the tape on October 7 was a game 
changer. Earlier that week I had interviewed a junior 
and a senior, both political science majors, who were 
happy to go on the record as Trump supporters. One 
of them, the junior, had supported Trump from the 
beginning of the Republican primary. He thought the 
candidate had good ideas about fiscal policy, was mov­
ing the party beyond “attempting to regulate morality” 
by opposing gay marriage and would support small 
business owners. Trump’s rhetoric “has really been 
uncalled for at times,” but he thought the media was 
taking Trump’s words out of context. A few days after 
the tape came out the junior emailed first to say that he 
no longer planned to vote for Trump, and then to insist 
that his name be removed “due to our political climate 
on campus.” The senior had conisdered Trump “the 
lesser of two evils”—until the tape came out and he 
decided that he would not vote for Trump and did not 
want his name associated with the candidate. 
“I am hoping the Republican Party will try and do 
something with this,” he wrote in an email. “I really 
don’t know if there is a fix for this type of problem.”


**Title: Yale Democrats Canvass in New Hampshire**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

With thirty-six days before the election, a group of 
Yale Democrats boarded a bus paid for by U.S. Con­
gresswoman Rosa DeLauro and rode to Keene, New 
Hampshire to canvass for Hillary Clinton. (The New 
Republicans are hoping to visit later this month to 
canvass for Kelly Ayotte with the Harvard Republican

Club.) Polls show Trump and Clinton neck and neck 
in this state of Rockwellian small towns and some of 
America’s highest opioid overdose death rates. 

The stretch of Route 101 heading into Keene from 
the Massachusetts border is dotted with TRUMP signs, 
their bright blue jumping out against a backdrop of 
autumnal leaves. The Clinton campaign occupies a 
storefront in Keene’s busy downtown. There was none 
of the handwringing or anxiety I heard among Yale’s 
conservatives, nor the ambivalence many liberals hold 
towards Clinton. Inside the campaign office, by design, 
you forgot the narrative of presidential election as 
national existential crisis. 

When the Dems knocked on voters’ doors, you 
remembered. Maxwell Ulin, a senior from Santa Mon­
ica, California and president of the Dems, canvassed 
voters on three streets in a suburban neighborhood of 
tidy two-story homes. 

His list included undecided voters and those who 
leaned Republican. At each house, Ulin, lanky in light 
blue jeans and a darker blue button down, knocked and 
then stood at attention, carefully holding his Hillary 
for America campaign materials below his waist so the 
voter wouldn’t see them and get irritated before even 
opening the door. At the first house, a man cracked 
open the door. 
“Hi—” Ulin began.
“Politics?” the man asked.
“…yes,” Ulin replied.
“Have a good day,” the man said.

At a house with a Trump sign, Ulin followed his 
orders and still knocked on the front door. The mid­
dle-aged, sweatshirt-clad man who answered said every­
one in the house would be voting for Trump. Ulin 
moved on, and I stayed to ask the man what he thought 
of the Yale New Republicans. He hadn’t heard of them 
before, and he wasn’t terribly interested.
“That’s their choice,” he said, before shutting the 
door and returning to the football game. 

When he finished his list, Ulin had encountered 
an approximately representative cross-section of the 
American electorate: There was a Trump supporter, a 
Clinton supporter, and a lot of people who were mostly 
just mad about the whole thing. Good enough. After 
three hours in New Hampshire, the Dems headed back 
to New Haven, ultimately spending twice as much time 
on the bus as they did on the ground. 

That same weekend, I met a man named Paul Neu­
gebauer in the parking lot of a church in West Haven. A 
retired firefighter with grey hair and a thick mustache, 
EVERYONE KEPT 
SHOUTING, “TRUMP IS 
NOT A CONSERVATIVE 
TRUMP IS NOT A 
CONSERVATIVE!” AND 
HALF OF AMERICA 
DOES NOT CARE THAT 
CONSERVATIVE.
