he was dropping off donations. We started talking about 
politics when I mentioned a class I was taking called 
Modern US Liberalism and Conservatism.

“I’m a right-wing guy,” he said. “I think the country’s 
being stolen.”

For decades, he was a member of the firefighter’s 
union in Bridgeport, and just before the 2000 election 
he attended a union conference where Hillary Clin­
ton gave a speech he found dishonest. He doesn’t like 
Trump’s arrogance, but he thinks Trump is a patriot. 
What bothers him most about Clinton isn’t her politics 
so much as what he sees as her elitism—people like 
her, he is sure, think people like him are stupid. 

Neugebauer’s anger is a problem not only for the 
Democratic Party, but also for the New Republicans, 
who in rejecting his nominee are implying that they, 
too, think he is stupid. This might be the major prob­
lem revealed by this election: a large subset of Ameri­
can voters believe that the political elites—a category 
into which Yale students are lumped even when they 
technically hold no power—are laughing at them. 

When I asked the New Republicans how they think the 
Republican Party can reject Trumpism without alien­
ating his millions of supporters, Rasmussen mentioned 
the danger of listening to the masses. Gabriel said he 
hopes Trump-style populism will lose favor after this 
election. They didn’t have a solution for bringing voters 
like Neugebauer into a reimagined Republican Party.

I asked Neugebauer what he thought of the New 
Republicans. He paused for a long moment. 

“I think your generation succumbs to a lot of social 
pressure,” he said. “I think these kids’ decisions were 
based more on how they appear to the public than what 
they actually believe.”

It was clear that talk of principles would not per­
suade Neugebauer to reconsider his support for 
Trump, because he didn’t even buy that those princi­
ples were authentically held. And none of this matters, 
really, because Neugebauer thinks that if Trump wins, 
President Obama will somehow create an excuse to 
remain in office. In other words, Neugebeauer no lon­
ger believes that American democracy actually exists.

The New Republicans have to believe that it does. 
They have to believe that Americans on the right, given 
the choice, will reject Trumpism and accept the wis­
dom of rebuilding a big-tent party staked firmly to con­
servative principles. But when you leave Yale, drive to 
Keene or across the West River to West Haven, in front 
of house after house, for miles of highway, you see the 
signs: TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. And you wonder if 
the New Republicans, who think their whole party is at 
a crossroads, might be standing there alone.
