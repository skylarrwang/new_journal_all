In the second semester of her first year, Abbey Kim called an 
ambulance for a friend who was clearly too drunk to look after, 
and subsequently learned how much money an ambulance 
ride could cost. So when the situation came up again later that 
year—when Abbey’s friend got dangerously drunk, to the point 
of needing an IV in the hospital—she postponed calling 911 for 
two hours. “I don’t want to impose the cost of an ambulance 
on someone without it actually being dire, if that could be a 
serious thing for them,” Abbey said. Another time, Abbey and her 
friends were up until 6 in the morning taking care of an extremely 
intoxicated friend, rather than calling for help. “She was very, 
very drunk and it was shocking to see because she just is not 
someone who gets sick easily,” Abbey told me. “At that point, 
everyone knew that it cost money to call an ambulance….And so 
I think people just followed the ‘hopefully it’ll pass’ strategy.” Now, 
Abbey and her friends have established a plan of action for each 
of them, should someone require an ambulance. “The…situation 
forced us to have conversations while sober about what we 
would want to happen to us if we got too drunk,” Abbey said.

When Lillian Zhou had too much to drink one Friday night 
in February, 2022—exhibiting the warning signs for over-
intoxication she’d learned from Yale alcohol safety officers—her 
roommate decided to call the student health line. An ambulance 
showed up to take Lillian to the Yale New Haven Hospital. When 
she was released early the following morning, with a nasty hang-
over and the advice to take an Uber home, she didn’t know that 
a month later she would be hit with a nearly $1,000 ambulance 
bill. “I was not in a situation to understand what level of bill I was 
getting myself into, or that my insurance wasn’t going to cover it,” 
she said. It took her months to finally pay it off. She had to beg her 
parents for money, though it’s very uncomfortable to talk about 
alcohol-related matters with her family (they offered to pay a 
small portion of the bill). She tried to get help from Yale and talked 
with her FroCo, Yale Health, and the Yale New Haven Hospital, but 
wasn’t able to recoup any money. “I found it preoccupied me a fair 
bit for most of that semester.” Lillian said. “It was a very different 
kind of stress than you feel normally in college, and one that I 
obviously don’t think it’s fair to be subjected to.”
STORY 3

January are likely footing the entire bill, while 
those who wait until December might get 
off easier. Often the costliest factor is the co-
insurance, or the percentage of the bill that the 
patient is responsible for paying. All this can 
leave a fully-insured patient with hundreds or 
more to pay out-of-pocket.
Often, however, an ambulance service is not 
covered by a student’s insurance at all, which 
leaves them vulnerable to “surprise billing.” A 
surprise bill can occur when a patient inadver­
tently receives emergency treatment from an out-
of-network provider. In the case of ambulances, 
the dispatcher will almost always send whatever 
provider is available and nearby, whether or not 
they’re contracted with the patient’s health plan. 
Because patients don’t get to choose what service 
comes to get them, they have nothing to protect 
them from out-of-network billing rates. They can 
either get in whatever ambulance shows up, and 
risk having to pay an inflated bill, or refuse the 
care altogether.
A study conducted by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation (KFF), one of the nation’s leading 
sources of medical analysis and journalism, found 
that approximately 50 percent of national ground 
ambulance transports to emergency rooms ended 
in a surprise bill; another study by Health Affairs 
found that in Connecticut, that number balloons 
to 66 percent. I spoke with the lead author of the 
KFF study, Krutika Amin, who confirmed that 
ambulances result in the highest out-of-network 
billing rate of any medical service. 
Madeline 
O’Brien, 
research 
fellow 
at 
Georgetown University’s Center on Health 
Insurance Reforms, emphasized the bind that 
surprise billing puts on students. “This is a situa­
tion where students do not have choice,” she told 
me. “In the vast majority of cases, people who are 
calling an ambulance need to be in an ambulance. 
And we don’t want [them] . . . being in a situation 
where they can’t make it to the hospital or they’re 
stuck waiting in the emergency room . . . because 
they were worried about cost.”
Yale Health offers undergraduates two levels 
of insurance: Basic, and Hospitalization/Specialty 
Care. The Basic plan is free for every enrolled 
student, and does not cover the cost of ground 
ambulances. The Specialty plan (costing $2,756 
for a full term) does cover ambulances, with no 
copay. Yale Specialty is offered free of charge for 
every student on full financial aid, and is currently 
owned by 52 percent of the undergraduate body, 
according to Dr. McCarthy. The remaining 48 
percent have some other form of insurance––usu­
ally provided through their parents or guardians’ 
plans. It’s this half who are most susceptible to the 
crushing costs of ambulances. 
In January, 2022, the No Surprises Act went 
into effect, which largely protects patients from 
paying out-of-network rates for doctors and 
treatment facilities they did not get to choose. 
“Millions of hard-working Americans will no 
longer have to worry about unexpected medical 
bills,” President Biden announced in February, 
2022. But this was not entirely true. While the 
No Surprises Act kicks into action once a patient 
is in the hospital, it 
doesn’t account for the 
costs incurred on the 
drive over. In light of 
this vulnerability, ten 
states have taken pro­
active steps to pass 
some level of protec­
tion for surprise billing 
from 
ground 
ambu­
lances. Connecticut is 
not one of them.
The only bulletproof way to avoid a surprise 
bill: don’t call an ambulance in the first place. It 
would seem this is the route many Yale students 
opt for.
Two million dollars is 0.0048 
percent of Yale’s endowment; 4.7 
percent of what Yale spent on 
library acquisitions in 2018; and 
3.5 percent of what the University 
spent on athletics the same year. 
SO SOMEONE’S CALLING AN 
AMBULANCE FOR YOU. HERE’S WHAT 
TO EXPECT ON YOUR AMR BILL.
You’re awake, alert, and it’s not too serious.
You don’t look so good. It seems serious: chest 
pain, trouble breathing, an allergic reaction, loss 
of consciousness, or struck by a vehicle, perhaps.
During the ride,
They’re here but you refuse to get in.
Dispatch sends a basic life support (BLS) 
ambulance, meant for less critical injuries.
The BLS ambulance that was dispatched still 
treats you outside.
The ALS ambulance that was dispatched still 
*An emergency response is an immediate response to a 911 call or the equivalent. The 
ALS 1 level of service has a non-emergency response option, hence the distinction.

Dispatch sends an advanced life support (ALS) 
ambulance. Those are staffed with at least one 
paramedic and carry life-saving medication.
During transportation, you need to be given 
multiple administrations of medication or a 
procedure like chest decompression.
You’re charged for every mile driven.
