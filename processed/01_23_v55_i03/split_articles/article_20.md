Since the disbandment, some play­
ers joined other teams or started coach­
ing, while others moved on to different 
professions. The players most involved 
with Elm City Internationals are still 
in contact with the kids they mentored, 
usually through FaceTime. Ted Haley 
remains at Post University. Foley has 
directed much of his energy back to the 
New Haven Gooners. He still has the 
PIZZA flag, however, packed away at his 
parents’ house.


Foley remembers his time with Elm 
City as a “weird little bright spot” in his 
life while he worked a job he didn’t like. 
For one excellent summer, he slipped 
into a routine: meeting friends for 
drinks, going to the game, winning, and 
then bringing everyone back to the bar 
to celebrate.


“Knowing the way it ended and how 
disappointing it would be, I’d still take it,” 
he says. “I wouldn’t even say bittersweet, 
just sweet memories.” 


Nelkin hasn’t given up on his dream 
of a New Haven soccer team. He thinks 
the Elm City fan base lies dormant, 
ready to be resurrected at any moment. 
Yale’s renovated soccer field, set in front 
of the brick backdrop of Coxe Cage 
field house, reminds Nelkin of a small 
English stadium, and he believes that, 
if Elm City Express came back, they 
could consistently sell it out. Every time 
he passes the stadium, he peeks inside 
and imagines: the stands brimming 
with New Haven soccer heads, the pitch 
studded with players in navy shirts, the 
air filled with chanting, a shrill whistle, 
and the echo of drums. ∎

Slowly, an image began to 
emerge—one of a team so 
intimate, so tangible for
fans that, for one summer,
it became transcendent.
