THE COST TO RIDE
FROCOS
“The culture that surrounds this at Yale . . . calling 
an ambulance for someone is really a last 
resort . . . I would say it’s a dilemma that pretty 
much every student at Yale will go through
at least once, if not deciding as a FroCo figure, 
then at least as a friend.” J. ’22, FORMER FROCO

F
ew people are placed in a graver and more con­
fusing situation regarding acute intoxication 
than Yale’s FroCos. Since Yale trains FroCos to 
err on the side of caution when one of their first 
years is in need of medical attention, many stu­
dents know that in certain situations, contacting 
a FroCo is the same as contacting the paramed­
ics. In the experience of more than a few students, 
this Yale policy serves to further isolate them from 
the people best equipped to provide help, and can 
compound the danger of an emergency. 
But FroCos are students themselves. They 
know first-hand what it’s like to worry about the 
cost of an ambulance. At one point, they might 
have had to conceal their intoxication from their 
own FroCos. For J. ’22, a former FroCo, these 
memories are all too fresh.
“We didn’t really realize how difficult things 
could be very quickly if you didn’t have a specialty 
health care coverage,” she told me, referring to a 
time her first year when she called an ambulance 
for her friend. “And so that kind of influenced 
when I was a senior and I called an ambulance for 
someone, the first thing I asked was, ‘Are you for 
sure under specialty coverage?’”

FroCos who encounter emergency situations 
involving alcohol find themselves in an especially 
agonizing bind, J. told me. On the one hand, they 
have close bonds with students and want to save 
them the expense of an ambulance ride that may 
well be unnecessary. On the other hand, they are 
in positions of authority, and choosing not to call 
would deliberately flout protocol. 
“I remember during training they told us that 
we had to call the ambulance if the student was 
unresponsive,” said J. “I remember after that talk 
the [FroCo team] came together and were like, 
‘No, that’s ridiculous. If someone is not able to pay 
for it, we will Uber them there.’” 

Uber is an option for some students, but 
comes with its own host of limitations. Many 
students do not feel safe taking a non-emergency 
vehicle to the hospital––having to obey traffic 
laws and risk sickness en route; and many drivers 
do not feel comfortable carrying a sick student. 
For Matt Chin ’22, former Berkeley FroCo, 
the paramount concern is safety.
“At the end of the day as a FroCo we don’t 
have professional medical experience. So a lot 
of the times when we go into situations, it’s a 
judgment call,” he told me. “And for me person­
ally, I think that really the anxiety around those 
situations comes from just wanting to do the best 
I can to uphold the safety of everyone.”

Despite this, Chin says he dislikes Yale’s pol­
icy, which for him was one of the most frustrat­
ing parts of being a FroCo: “It was baffling to 
me where there was policy in place [that] almost 
counteracted that trust students had in FroCos,” 
he said. “[It] almost seemed counterintuitive to 
what FroCos are in place for and the guidance 
that we received.”

Some students have found strategies to work 
around Yale’s FroCo policy. Will resorted to 
talking to one FroCo in code. “One time I called 
the FroCo and I said, ‘hey, hypothetically, if my 
friend is really drunk, can I explain some hypo­
thetical symptoms to you, and you can tell me 
what you think?’” Will told me. “That’s sort of a 
way of getting around the red tape, and the FroCo 
was fine with doing that.”


**Title: DEVELOPING AN AMBULANCE SYSTEM**

DEVELOPING AN 
AMBULANCE SYSTEM
“I think that whenever Yale sets a cap on their 
resources for emergen[cy] situations, it’s going 
to lead to issues.” ERIN BAILEY ’24

T
here is another way that Yale could ease the 
burden of ambulance fees on students: operate 
its own emergency transport service.

It is relatively common for universities to 
run ambulance systems out of their student EMS 
programs, at little to no cost to the student body. 
Self-reported data on the National Collegiate 
Emergency Medical Service Foundation web­
site––an organization that encompasses stu­
dent-run EMS programs on college campuses 
across the world––shows that thirty-eight of the 
261 represented U.S. colleges supply ambulance 
services to their students.

From my conversations with EMS captains at 
other schools, it appears this does a lot to encour­
age students to seek medical attention. “We see a 
lot of times, we’ll get on scene and a student does 
not want to go to the hospital that really needs 
to go,” said Maribeth Novsak, Chief of Rowan 
University EMS. “So us being able to walk in and 
say, ‘hey, you’re not going to get a bill for this’ . . . it 
usually can get them to get into the ambulance 
and go to the hospital.”

Michelle Kight, Chief of Montclair State 
EMS, told a similar story. “I have recently heard of 
a case where a student didn’t want to go to the 
hospital, and that was the rationale that they gave, 
is that they thought we billed,” she told me. “And 
we’re like, ‘No, we don’t bill, we’ll take you for no 
fee.’ And then they went.”

If Yale wanted to set up an ambulance system 
on campus, they would probably start with Yale

Emergency Medical Services (YEMS). YEMS is a 
Yale organization made up of volunteer student 
EMTs––most commonly seen at sports games 
or other large events. Though they’re qualified 
to administer basic life support––same as any 
professional EMT––they currently only provide 
stand-by coverage. In other words, they don’t 
respond to calls.
I talked to Judi 
Reynolds, 
New 
Haven’s Regional EMS 
Coordinator, about what 
it would take for YEMS 
to expand into an ambu­
lance agency. Together 
we went through each of 
the state requirements. 
Given 
the 
necessary 
funding and patience, 
there were really only 
two that posed a consid­
erable challenge. 
The 
first––person­
nel acquisition––is the­
oretically achievable, say 
members of the YEMS 
Executive Board and 
university EMS captains. 
In order to earn Primary 
Service Area Responder 
(PSAR) status for Yale 
campus––the designation that allows an orga­
nization to run an ambulance program ––YEMS 
would need to provide 24/7 coverage, 365 days a 
year. That would likely require hiring licensed 
EMTs outside the student body to fill in during the 
times of year when students are on break. The only 
Connecticut college to do this is the University of 
Connecticut, by way of their in-house fire depart­
ment. William Perez, Chief of UConn Fire, told 
me the effort wouldn’t be worth the requisite time 
and money for Yale, so long as back-end reim­
bursement options exist.

The second challenge I discussed with Judi 
Reynolds is more herculean. According to CT 
law, only one agency can serve as the designated 
PSAR in a given municipality at a time. Currently, 
for Yale campus, that agency is AMR. “If you want 
to have an ambulance, then that’s an agreement 
[with AMR] or a relinquishing by them,” Reynolds 
said.

So Yale would have to get AMR to volun­
tarily give up the service rights to Yale campus, 
no doubt a sizable portion of their New Haven 
income. Though Yale could conceivably exert 
enormous pressure on AMR, the chances of them 
succeeding appear small. To hear Chief Perez talk 
about it, Yale would have the same luck asking 
AMR to write them a check. “If 
me or you work at AMR we’d be 
like, ‘What? Absolutely not.’ That’s 
our business. That’s our bread and 
butter,” he said.

AMR earned 860 million dollars in revenue 
in 2021. The North American ambulance services 
market as a whole was valued at 18.85 billion U.S. 
dollars in 2022, according to a 2022 report by 
Grand View Research, and is expected to reach 
$40.64 billion by 2030. “Ambulances…it’s a busi­
ness. [They make it so complicated] to keep 
things in check.” Chief Perez said. “It keeps the 
chess board stable. So when you move that chess 
piece, a lot of people gotta agree and a lot of peo­
ple gotta know.”

I asked Dr. McCarthy if Yale Health had ever 
discussed acquiring their own ambulances: “We 
have not…There are lots of requirements.”

I asked Shaun Heffernon if YEMS had ever 
reached out to AMR: “To the best of my knowl­
edge, they have not formally requested to expand 
their services.”

**Title: TAKING CARE**

TAKING CARE
“There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be free.
[Yale has] the money. Even if it hurts their 
budget a little bit, they have the money.”
KYLE HOVANNESIAN ’25

C
hief Perez had his own idea for how to main­
tain student safety, for a much lower price tag. 
“Is there any way [Yale] could set aside a little 
pot of money with some administrator that exam­
ines it case by case? How much can it be?” he said. 
“How is that a bad thing?”

The problem of ambulance bills raises a fun­
damental question about the University’s respon­
sibility to its students. To be clear, ambulances are 
not the only medical expense students struggle 
with, nor the only reason they might delay med­
ical care. However, according to student accounts, 
they present a disproportionately large obstacle 
to seeking emergency medical attention and an 
unreasonable financial burden. 

Madeline O’Brien believes something needs 
to change. “Any situation where somebody is not 
taking [an ambulance] because they’re worried 
about cost, that could be life or death,” she said. 
“So even if I don’t have the data on all the peo­
ple who are doing that, if you know one person 
at Yale, or a handful of people at Yale, who didn’t 
get service and it could have made a difference in 
their safety, then that’s an issue that needs to be 
solved,” she said. 

Chief Perez seemed to agree. “I don’t need
. . . something bad happening to you guys because 
you don’t want to call 911 because you don’t want 
to pay,” he told me. “I’d pay for it out of my damn 
pocket before I let you get hurt.”

“It’s not right,” he added after a pause. “We’re 
supposed to take care of each other.” ∎
