THE COST TO RIDE
The New Journal
Outside the Yale New Haven Hospital emergency room.
Anna Tender was biking by the Peabody museum on Whitney 
Street when she fell off her bike and broke her wrist. A passerby 
noticed Anna laying on the ground, her skin flush pale, her hand 
sticking out in entirely the wrong direction, and decided to call 
an ambulance. But Anna was a junior, and by that time she’d 
heard a lot of stories from people who’d had to go to the hospital 
for alcohol emergencies. She knew what she might have to pay 
for it. “While I was laying there with my wrist broken, I was like, 
‘can you please not call 911?’” Anna said. “I just really did not want 
to pay for an ambulance ride.” When the ambulance showed up, 
Anna declined to get in, signing the refusal of service waiver with 
her nondominant hand. She took a seat by the Peabody, and 
waited fifteen minutes for a friend to come pick her up and drive 
her to the emergency room. “Thinking back on it, it’s wild that that 
was the thing that I was really worried about.”


“If you talk to any student, they’d agree that 
[ambulances] should be free,” Kyle told me. 
“And Yale knows it’s a problem, how could they 
not?...I’m sure they realize this is putting a finan­
cial burden on students. They’d just rather put the 
burden on me than pay for it themselves.
Most administrators I reached out to 
declined or did not respond to requests for com­
ment regarding the problems these twenty-one 
students described. Of the few administrators 
from whom I was able to obtain statements, 
none expressed prior awareness of the full scope 
of the issue.
THE ADMINISTRATION
“I think there definitely is a hesitation to call 
ambulances around here because of
the prohibitive cost . . . I would say that probably 
everyone at Yale, specifically people at
Yale who tend to go to events with alcohol or 
parties, probably knows someone who’s had 
to pay for an ambulance.” ANNA TENDER ’23
W
hen I was a first year, I learned quickly from 
friends and upperclassmen not to call an 
ambulance unless the situation was seriously 
life-threatening. It was part of my informal 
induction process to Yale, alongside how to sneak 
into the dining hall, or cram for my L1 final. In 
my experience as an undergraduate, Yale students 
who don’t hear the warning at first hear it eventu­
ally, and students who don’t hear it early enough 
often learn through painful experience. 
“I think that’s something that was drilled into 
me. Never call an ambulance because you will be 
charged like $1000 . . . I think it’s just like common 
knowledge,” said R.
High-ranking administrators at Yale, however, 
appear not to know this unwritten rule among 
Yale students. Dr. Jennifer McCarthy, Chief 
Medical Officer of Yale Health, told me she’d 
never looked into it. “Until you reached out to me, 
I hadn’t really thought of [cost] as an issue that 
would preclude people from calling,” she told me.
Shaun Heffernon, a prominent member 
of the Board of Advisors for Yale Emergency 
Medical Services (YEMS), and EMT instructor 
at Yale, said that, to his knowledge, worry about 
ambulance fees has never put a student at physical 
risk, nor have there been any internal discussions 
at YEMS about the problem of ambulance billing.
I reached out to many members of the 
Dean’s Office, including all fourteen residen­
tial college deans, Dean of Yale College Pericles 
Lewis, and Marichal Gentry, former Dean of 
Student Affairs and one of the founders of Yale’s 
Alcohol and Other Drugs Harm Reduction 
Initiative (AODHRI, pronounced “Audrey”). All 
either didn’t respond to requests for comment or 
redirected me to current Dean of Student Affairs, 
Melanie Boyd. Dean Boyd sent the following 
statement, after which she did not respond to
subsequent questions:
“I understand that money can be a worry, 
but many students nevertheless call for help in 
life-and-death situations when they think their 
friends’ lives are at risk.” Dean Boyd did not com­
ment on the high burden of ambulance payments, 
or elaborate on medical situations that were not 
life-and-death.
Hannah Peck, Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs, echoed Dean Boyd’s comments. “When 
we’ve looked into this issue in the past, we’ve 
heard from students that in the moment of an 
emergency, worry about costs does not deter 
them from getting help for their friends.” She 
did not respond to follow-up questions about the 
collection of those students’ perspectives.
THE COST OF CALLING
“Unless it’s like a life or death scenario and I
know that the person is going to die if they don’t
call an ambulance, then I would feel like my 
responsibility would be to provide as much non-
medical support as I could without calling an 
ambulance.” LUCY SANTIAGO ’24
M
ost of the Yale policy makers say that in a 
medical emergency, there should be no hesi­
tation in calling an ambulance. Safety comes first,
finances second. 
“As a physician and as a human,” Dr. 
McCarthy said, “you want them to call and deal 
with things like finance later.”
Yale does have a standard procedure for 
alcohol emergencies. AODHRI is a Yale program 
designed to minimize the “physical, psycholog­
ical, academic, and social” harm of alcohol and 
drug consumption on 
campus. The AODHRI 
website urges students 
to seek medical help 
when they’re alarmed 
by their friends’ condi­
tion. They offer a page 
of emergency numbers 
to call; at the top of the 
list is the Yale Police. 
Yale 
trains 
incom­
ing first years to call a 
First-Year 
Counselor 
(FroCo) or to call 911 
when they feel unsure what to do, and instructs 
FroCos to do the same for their first year stu­
dents. “Be willing to overreact to protect some­
one,” AODHRI admonishes.
But not all students heed this advice, espe­
cially if the situation involves alcohol. Josie Steuer

SECTION 3
Hannah Peck, Assistant Dean 
of Student Affairs, echoed Dean 
Boyd’s comments. “When we’ve 
looked into this issue in the past, 
we’ve heard from students that in 
the moment of an emergency, worry 
about costs does not deter them 
from getting help for their friends.”
SECTION 2



Ingall ’24, told me there are no circumstances in 
which she would call an ambulance for a drunk 
friend, “because it’s gonna cost ten bajillion dol­
lars.” Another student, A., said she’s been a lot 
more careful since an incident in which she had 
to pay an inordinate price for an emergency call. 
“Afterward, I told all my friends, ‘Never call an 
ambulance, just sleep it 
off, it’s not worth the 
cost.’ . . . It’s the attitude 
of many Yale students, 
and it’s so dangerous.”
It may be hard at 
first to understand why 
someone would risk 
their health. But in the 
experience of some stu­
dents who’ve had to cope with the aftereffects of 
a hospital stay, the “safety first” approach has cre­
ated financial burdens that outweigh the health 
risks. Some students who have taken an ambu­
lance, or know someone who has, say they will 
not call 911 without serious thought, no matter 
the potential danger.
“If I had known [about the cost], I would 
have begged my friends not to call, even when 
getting help may have been in my best interest,” 
said A.
“The financial strain that this put on me was 
very intense,” said Lillian Zhou ’24. “The insanely 
high price makes me not want to call [an ambu­
lance], for other people or myself.”
Tony Potchernikov ’24 remembers his ambu­
lance bill costing between $500 and $800, which 
meant that he had to extend credit payments to 
afford a plane ticket home at the beginning of 
the pandemic in 2020. “I remember thinking, ‘I 
have no idea what the hell I’m going to do,’” he 
said. It took Lillian the entire semester to earn the 
funds to pay back the $994 she owed, using a lot 
of savings from previous jobs. Josie Steuer Ingall 
contested her bill with her dad’s private insurance 
and was able to get it reduced from around $500 
to $200, which meant she didn’t have to skimp 
on things like groceries and personal expenses. “I 
legitimately would have been fucked,” she told me. 
For students who can’t afford to pay, a bill in 
their online health portal means potentially hav­
ing to go to their parents for help. Even if they 
can afford the cost on their own, some portion 
of the charge is likely to show up on their par­
ents’ insurance bill, alerting them to their child’s 
excessive drinking. For students who come from 
families that do not tolerate underage drinking, 
the shame of confessing to a disapproving family 
may be as painful as emptying their own pockets. 
“The first thing I was worried about was hav­
ing to tell my parents about the whole situation.” 
said Lillian. “Probably second to the how-am-I-
going-to-pay-all-of-this, is, this means I have to 
get my parents involved.”
It can be challenging for students to return to 
school and try to reinstitute a sense of normalcy 
with all this hanging over their heads. “The psy­
chic stress of . . . getting that bill was like being 
punched in the stomach,” Josie told me. A few 
students said they had trouble focusing on their 
classes after receiving their bills, preoccupied with 
the stress of debt and effort of earning the money 
back. “It’s hell,” Kyle said.
That’s a lot on the line for a single night of 
drinking. So when members of the administra­
tion recommend that students seek medical help 
when they feel their health is in danger, without 
regard to cost, it can feel ingenuous. 
“For some people, [the bill] is a drop in the 
bucket,” said Anna Tender ’23. “For other people, 
that’s an entire month’s worth of their rent.”
LET’S TALK ABOUT 
INSURANCE
“If you have an emergency situation, you’re 
calling 911 wherever you are and who’s
available is going to show up. So ideas like 
disclosing prices up front or giving people the 
opportunity to shop and compare don’t work 
in the ambulance space.” MADELINE O’BRIEN, 
RESEARCH FELLOW AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY’S 
CENTER ON HEALTH INSURANCE REFORMS
E
very undergraduate at Yale has some form 
of health insurance––it’s a requirement for 
enrollment. Why, then, are students claiming to 
pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a 
five minute ambulance ride?
Even before insurance kicks in, the final cost 
of an ambulance bill can be nearly impossible 
to predict. It varies by the type of care provided, 
the mileage driven, and a host of other factors. 
However, many students I spoke with brought up 
the same number as a kind of benchmark for the 
average ambulance rate: $1000. 
Charlotte Murphy ’23, shared the view of 
many students I spoke to: “If I can help myself, 
and have a friend monitor me, it’s not ideal, but 
it’s better than paying a thousand dollars.” 
One thousand dollars, before insurance, is 
on the low end for an ambulance ride. American 
Medical Response (AMR)––the designated ambu­
lance service for New Haven, and one of the larg­
est in the country––charges between $1005 and 
$2221, depending on the kind of life support they 
provide, and excluding additional fees. 
A student with non-Yale insurance that 
covers their emergency transport will likely still 
need to pay some portion of this charge. There’s 
the copay: the flat rate every patient is required 
to pay for a service––and the deductible: the 
amount a patient is responsible for paying each 
year before insurance starts chipping in. This 
means that students who need an ambulance in

The only bulletproof way to 
avoid a surprise bill: don’t call an 
ambulance in the first place. It 
would seem this is the route many 
Yale students opt for.
