coins’ pure composition and EB impres­
sion, the elaborate and unique designs 
covering each doubloon added to their 
historical and monetary value. The coins 
circulated in New York following their 
production, and in 1944, New York’s 
Holy Trinity Church donated one of the 
seven coins to Yale’s growing numismat­
ics collection.

Yale’s famous coin was not miss­
ing for long. Two years after the 1965 
break-in, Richard F. Andrews, an insur­
ance agent specializing in the discovery 
of lost valuables, recovered the doubloon 
in Miami. According to a 1982 New 
York Times article, Andrews was work­
ing a different case in Florida when he 
“came across a trail” that led him to the 
Doubloon. The same article noted that 
Andrews “traced [the coin] through 
underworld figures to a coin collector in 
Chicago” but maintained that the coin 
was found in Miami. Andrews refused 
to provide further information about 
the coin’s recovery to the Times, adding 
only that “no money exchanged hands” 
in return for the doubloon. He only 
explained that the “investigation of the 
missing coins is still active—if I reveal 
any details, it will make the job much 
more difficult.’”

Despite Andrews’ discretion, virtu­
ally no progress has been made on the 
case since 1967. Only one person has 
been convicted of a crime relating to 
the heist: John Reisen, an employee of 
the Chicago-based Columbia Stamp 
and Coin Company, was found stor­
ing sixty-nine of Yale’s missing coins in 
the company safe. The Yale Daily News 
reported on the event, emphasizing hope 
that Reisen’s arrest would lead to further 
discoveries relating to the heist. No fur­
ther arrests have been made in the six­
ty-five years following.

Yale librarians and administration 
seem to want to leave this dramatic com­
ponent of their numismatics career in 
the past. In 1981, Yale decided to sell their 
recovered Brasher Doubloon despite 
the energy and expenses invested in 
its recovery. The University reportedly 
needed the extra income to help fund 
the construction of the new Mudd 
library, leveraging the coin for a $650,000 
payout. Following its sale, Yale added 
that concerns over the security of the 
Doubloon contributed to the decision
to let it go.

Yale’s numismatics collection has 
continued to grow in prestige and con­
tents, despite its doubloon-less state. 
Perhaps the University’s eagerness to 
rid themselves of the Brasher Doubloon 
reflects their desire to move on from the 
embarrassment of the heist.

There is no shortage, however, of 
stories of other numismatic-related 
crimes. Contrary to the popular per­
ception of coin-collecting as a hobby, 
drama is rampant in the numismatics 
community. Just two years after Yale’s 
break-in, millions of dollars’ worth of 
coins were stolen from the Miami man­
sion of Willis H. du Pont, the former 
Chief Executive Officer of General 
Motors and a famed numismatist. The 
mansion’s alarm system reportedly 
failed to turn on when five masked 
burglars entered in the night. Du Pont 
interpreted the thieves’ demand to give 
them “the money” too literally, and led 
them to his basement coin collection. 
The five men made it out with over 
seven thousand coins, exceeding a mod­
ern value of ten million dollars. Among 
the loot was one of the other seven 
existing Brasher Doubloons.

According to another article pub­
lished by the Professional Coin Grading 
Service, one of the Miami thieves decided 
to keep a stolen coin for himself. He hap­
pened to select the Brasher Doubloon. 
For safekeeping, he taped it to his ankle. A 
few months later, he was admitted to the 
hospital following a severe beating by his 
mafioso father-in-law. The nurses attend­
ing to him found the doubloon still taped 
to his leg, recovering a coin worth nearly 
one million dollars.

Unlike the du Pont robbery, which 
is well-recorded and well known among 
coin collectors of varying degrees of seri­
ousness, the infamous Yale Numismatics 
Collection heist is only infamous among 
those entrenched in mint madness—a 
small, but dedicated audience. This is 
despite the odd similarities in the cases. 
Even Yale’s undergraduate coin commu­
nity was largely unaware of the dramatic

Yale heist, until after the inaugural 
meeting of the Yale Numismatics Club, 
formed in 2021 by undergraduate numis­
matists eager to work more closely with 
the famed collection.

“A lot of people imagine coin collec­
tors as nerdy kids or really old men,” said 
Noah Savolainen ’25, a sophomore in 
Grace Hopper College and co-founder 
of the Numismatics Club. “And there are 
a lot of those. But many coin dealers are 
just successful finance guys or suave high 
school dealers who sell coins instead of 
drugs.” Like the Yale heist revealed, the 
coin world can be equally lucrative and 
deceptive—traders need insider knowl­
edge and a reputation of integrity within 
the community.

“I’ve been involved with coin collect­
ing for a very long time, and it’s become 
a social and professional element of my 
life, on top of it being a hobby,” said 
Savolainen. He’s not alone. A few days 
before Savolainen spoke with me, he had 
been in Florida at the Florida United 
Numismatists (FUN) show, which attracts 
hundreds of dealers and thousands of 
attendees.

“Coin collecting is a hobby for almost 
everybody who’s involved with it, and 
a business for the others,” Savolainen 
explained. At FUN, Savolainen attended 
an auction offering coins from the col­
lection of Harry Bass—a millionaire 
financier and avid numismatist—with 
sales that totalled $24 million.

The auction is a high-energy 
scene. Objects smaller than an iPhone 
can pack a room with people will­
ing to spend millions on a single coin. 
Someone attending their first auction, 
or perhaps even their first coin show, 
could be seated next to someone with 
a world-renowned collection and never 
know it. Noah said, “The President of 
[Heritage Auctions] was on the phone 
speaking with anonymous buyers bid­
ding through the phone. There is a lot of 
anonymity within the coin world.” He 
explained that security is a large issue 
that most collectors, buyers, and sellers 
often worry about.

Christian Hartch, a junior at 
Princeton University and fellow numis­
matist, reinforced this concern. He and 
Noah recently visited the New York 
International Numismatics Conference, 
where World Numismatics—a collec­
tion showing at the event—claimed to 
have around six figures worth of coins 
stolen from the show. Hartch said, 
“There’s always stuff going around, get­
ting stolen.”

But despite this rather dramatic ele­
ment of the coin world, it is not often 
talked about or highlighted as a large 
component of the community cul­
ture. In fact, Hartch, who created and 
runs one of the largest coin-oriented 
YouTube 
channels—Treasure 
Town 
Coins, with over one hundred thousand 
subscribers—had not even heard of the 
Yale heist until he learned of this article.

The heist that occurred at Yale sev­
enty years ago was not rare in that valu­
able objects, easily used as collateral on 
the black market or liquified for its com­
ponent assets, are often the subject of 
large robberies. What makes this heist so 
peculiar is its lack of closure.

Today, Yale’s numismatics collec­
tion is alive and well. In 2001, the con­
tinuously growing collection boasting 
three hundred thousand coins moved 
into the bright, beautiful Bela Lyon 
Pratt Gallery of Numismatics in the 
Yale University Art Gallery. The gallery 
is composed of two adjacent wood-pan­
eled rooms. The room on the right takes 
up the valuable real estate of a museum 
corner room with large, undisrupted 
windows looking down on Chapel 
Street. It houses just one large table 
that sits surrounded by a small library 
of worn books. The adjacent room of 
the gallery more resembles a maze of 
history, housing multiple floor-to-ceil­
ing shelving units tightly packed with 
foam and leather padding. Despite the 
romantic and grand atmosphere of the 
gallery, unlike the glamorous drama of 
the fine arts community and their mil­
lion-dollar mysteries, no one wants to 
talk about the successful collection’s 
mysterious past. Even the current cura­
tors of Yale’s collection—who hold the 
responsibility of elevating the collec­
tion’s profile—declined to comment on 
the crime. For now, things remain quiet 
and unsolved in the mystery of the 
missing coins. No one seems to want to 
dwell on it. Few even know about it. ∎
