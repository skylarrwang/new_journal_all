To get both 
these pieces of 
identification, you 
run into circularities 
and dead ends.
If applicants want 
to recall a birth 
certificate, they need 
an identification. 
If they want an 
identification card, 
they need a birth 
certificate. But what 
are applicants meant 
to do when they are 
starting over?


Similar problems occur with this option—pass­
ports, which expire ten years after being issued, are 
no longer valid for many leaving incarceration. And 
to apply for one, applicants must show a birth cer­
tificate, proof of identity, and pay the required fees 
(which consist of a $130 application fee and a $35 
“execution fee”).
To get both these pieces of identification, you 
run into circularities and dead ends. If applicants 
want to recall a birth certificate, they need an iden­
tification. If they want an identification card, they 
need a birth certificate. But what are applicants 
meant to do when they are starting over?


The second category of documentation that 
applicants are required to show at the DMV is proof 
of Social Security. This can be in the form of a 
Social Security card, or specific tax forms. 
Tax forms, however, require consistent 
employment that not all formerly incar­
cerated people have. They are also usually 
given to employees in January to denote 
the payments of the year before; depend­
ing on when they begin work, this could 
leave applicants up to a year with no 
identification. 
Ramsay still has his Social Security 
number, but this is not enough for the 
DMV—they want the physical card. This 
can be another dead end: in order to request 
a Social Security card replacement from 
the Social Security Administration, appli­
cants are asked to show a driver’s license.
It’s circular. 
Ramsay has been unable to acquire 
his Social Security card so far. Robinson 
notes that the pandemic made it more 
difficult to secure his own card, as he had 
to make routine calls to explain his situa­
tion instead of going to the offices directly 
and receiving guidance.


For proof of residency, there must 
be two pieces of mail from two separate 
senders. This means that people experi­
encing housing insecurity face additional 
barriers.


Ramsay is still fighting to get his 
identification and Social Security card; he 
has depended on EMERGE’s assistance throughout the 
process. He gets little help from his probation officer. 
The State of Connecticut’s Judicial Branch defines 
the role of probation officers as responsible for pro­
viding “intake, assessment, referral, and supervision 
services to [the] sentenced individual.” This notably 
includes check-ins to ensure that probationers are 
making progress in their re-integration. Despite 
this, Ramsay’s probation officer has told Ramsay that 
securing his documentation is not within the scope 
of their work, emphasizing to Ramsay that the offi­
cer’s role is to come to Ramsay’s house or office, take 
urinalyses, and make sure he has a job.
“It’s easy to say ‘You know what? Eff this.’ and 
go back to what we know,” Ramsay says. “And that’s 
where the problem comes in . . . You go through a lot 
of hurdles, but I just try to stay faithful.”


To secure a license, they have to navigate the 
plethora of documents and applications to secure 
their documentation, pay all the required costs, 
acclimate to life post-incarceration, abide by their 
probation officer’s requirements, and work towards 
financial stability in the process. If all of this sounds 
confusing, that’s because it is. 
There are barriers for people post-incarceration 
who’ve held driver’s licenses in the past, too: incar­
ceration usually implies driver’s license suspension. 
In order to retain the license, there is a required 
restoration fee of $175. If there are taxes 
owed on a vehicle under the applicant’s 
name, then the taxes or tickets must be 
paid off, too, before the driver’s license 
can be restored. 
Once those are all paid, driving priv­
ileges are restored, meaning it becomes 
possible to apply for a learner’s permit. 
Even if someone has formerly held a 
license, they are required to re-acquire 
a permit, with the restriction that the 
holder can only drive when accompanied 
by someone twenty years or older who 
has held a license without suspension for 
more than four consecutive years. After 
ninety days with a permit, applications 
must pass a vision test and a twenty-five-
question knowledge test, and take an 
eight-hour Safe Driving Practices Course. 
Failure of the vision or knowledge tests 
require applicants to reschedule the tests 
online and pay the fees once again. These 
include a $40 testing fee (that includes 
all the tests) and a $19 fee for the learn­
er’s permit itself. The fee for a non-driver 
state identification is $28. This process can 
be long and expensive.


Not only are the abundance of fees a 
barrier to many, testees need to provide 
their own vehicle for the driver’s exam 
and potentially miss work for the per­
mit test, Safe Driving Practices Course, and driv­
er’s test. Availability for appointments range from 7 
a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays, with some available slots 
on Saturdays.


Robinson had to wait almost a year to get his 
Social Security card. His documentation was lost 
during his sentence, although he is not sure why. 
Through work with the Parole Project in Louisiana, 
where he was incarcerated, and EMERGE in New 
Haven, he has managed to secure his Social Security 
card, birth certificate, and, as of October, his learn­
er’s permit. Following his release, Robinson moved 
to New Haven to support his mother, with whom 
he currently lives. He notes that securing a Social 
Security card was particularly difficult as a result of 
the pandemic, since he could not go to the offices 
and work out what was necessary. Instead, he fielded 
calls and emails until he was able to secure it.


Robinson had to return on three separate occa­
sions to the DMV before they granted him a learner’s 
permit. Once, they refused him because the letter he 
showed did not have a date on it.
“You see so many people,” Robinson says. “They 
become heartbroken because they go to get their 
license and many fail time and time again. And it’s 
like it’s very next door to being impossible.”


In total, fees can amount to about $348, including 
testing, document copies, restoration fees, and the 
combined cost of securing both a permit and license. 
Applicants also have to pay the fees for each attempt 
if they fail, a burden for those with inconsistent or 
low-paying work.
“Those are barriers that you have to go through, 
but you got to go through them because you’re try­
ing to dismiss catching the bus and being to work 
on time,” Robinson says. “You don’t have 
a lot of support. You don’t have a lot of 
help . . . Just trial and error, you know, that’s 
how you learn the system.”


Robinson finally secured his permit 
on October 10, 2022, about a year after his 
release. 
“It’s wonderful,” Robinson says. “I’ve 
gotten a job and through EMERGE and 
been promoted from a crew member to a 
shop manager. Now I’m real close to get­
ting my driver’s license . . . And I’m not the 
only one.”


A
s a result of this long and diffi­
cult process, many people reintegrat­
ing post-incarceration drive without a 
license, according to Liman Fellow and 
lawyer Hannah Duncan. Throughout 
her work in public interest law, she has 
been informed of cases where individuals 
violate parole, probation, or supervised 
release in order to drive out of necessity.
“It’s just so much easier,” Woodcock, 
EMERGE’s Executive Director, says. “Your 
chances of being pulled over are pretty slim, but if 
you do get pulled over without a license, and you’re 
on parole, you can get violated and sent back to jail. 
So that’s the risk that you run.” 
The problem does not end once a license is 
secured. Now comes the process of buying and reg­
istering a car.


Getting a car alone is a costly process. In the 
last two years, used-car prices have increased dra­
matically—used car prices are currently 43 percent 
higher nationally than the typical depreciation rates. 
Additionally, securing a loan to pay for a car is sig­
nificantly harder for someone with both a criminal 
history and little to no credit history. 
In order to register a car, identification in the 
form of a driver’s license or passport must be pro­
vided, along with proof of ownership in the form of 
a title or former owner registration. If the vehicle is 
from another state, there are different requirements.


The DMV also requires proof of Connecticut car 
insurance and a Bill of Sale, a document with vehicle, 
buyer, and seller information, as well as the selling 
price and date of the vehicle. These can be drafted 
independently as long as they include all the nec­
essary information. Car insurance in Connecticut 
can cost upwards of $800 per car, but drivers with 
a driving record or violation are charged more—
sometimes upwards of $2,000. Despite car insur­
ance being mandatory in most states, companies can 
still deny applicants due to many factors, including 
credit history, type of vehicle, financial history and 
driving record.


The DMV charges fees for car registration, in 
addition to the insurance required for registra­
tion. To register a regular passenger car, the fees
total $225.


Ramsay notes that a license may seem like 
“a small thing, but it’s a big thing at 
the end of the day.” He echoes that 
the difficulty of the process can be 
inhibiting to many who are trying
to reintegrate. 
While only 10 percent of Connecticut 
residents are Black and 15 percent are 
Hispanic, 40 percent of incarcerated peo­
ple in Connecticut are Black and 25 per­
cent of them are Hispanic. As a result, 
these re-entry costs largely impact people 
of color disproportionately. 
Things like state identifications and 
driver’s licenses are determined by state 
and federal requirements, meaning local 
government has little bearing on these 
requirements. New Haven’s main contri­
bution to people reintegrating is through 
workarounds to getting a driver’s license: 
the public transit system and continued 
development of bike lanes. In summer 
of 2022, New Haven announced its Safe 
Routes for All Plan, which hopes to move 
away from a city transportation system 
that is based around cars, by enhancing the 
infrastructure of biking, walking, and pub­
lic transit in the city. 
Woodcock, EMERGE’s Executive Director, notes 
that most formerly incarcerated people he is aware 
of through EMERGE take public transportation 
or depend on others for car rides, while a smaller 
amount bike or walk. 
Ramsay continues to gather the necessary doc­
uments to get his permit soon. Robinson will soon 
be scheduling his first attempt at his road test since 
passing the written test for a driver’s license.
“If you don’t have this documentation, [it’s easy 
to] go back to what you know,” Ramsay says. “But 
that wasn’t my case. I said, ‘You know what? I’m just 
gonna still take it one day at a time.’” ∎
