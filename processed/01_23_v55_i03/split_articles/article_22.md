On top of the burden 
of finding a job is 
finding one accessible 
through public 
transportation. With 
no car and no flexible 
income to afford 
ride-share apps 
or taxis, formerly 
incarcerated people 
depend on buses, 
trains, bicycles, or 
walking to get to and 
from work.


Like Robinson, he is employed at EMERGE, a 
self-described “self-sufficient social enterprise com­
mitted to assisting formerly incarcerated people 
successfully integrate back into their families and 
communities.” They have a variety of programs for 
formerly incarcerated people to get started, includ­
ing a Transitional Employment Program, peer-
to-peer group meetings called Real Talk, and a 
Trauma Informed Men’s Group. In their Transitional 
Employment Program, participants earn at least $15 
an hour, while working up to twenty-four hours 
a week in construction, landscaping, and property 
management. The other sixteen hours of the work 
week are reserved for support programs.


There are six supervisors at EMERGE, all of whom 
have been through EMERGE’s programs and have 
experience being formerly incarcerated. EMERGE 
Executive Director Alden Woodcock calls them “the 
heart and soul of the organization,” noting their roles 
teaching crewmembers, communicating 
with staff, operating equipment, and car­
ing for the organization’s tools, vehicles,
and equipment.


In the mornings, participants arrive 
at EMERGE’s headquarters at 830 Grand 
Avenue—on a bus line—and from there 
they split up and drive to different worksites 
or work from the headquarters. EMERGE 
supports their participants throughout the 
process of securing documents, bus passes, 
and licenses. They helped Ramsay get a bus 
pass and Robinson secure his permit.


Ramsay found out about EMERGE at 
a job fair. There were construction hats 
lined up on a table and some people in 
discussion around it. He walked over and 
started up a conversation. “They heard my 
story and wanted to see better for me and 
I’ve been there ever since,” Ramsays says. 
“Everything that I need to really navigate 
in society EMERGE has helped me to get.”


Ramsay is now one of the supervi­
sors at EMERGE, many of whom drive 
newer employees to their job assign­
ments. Supervisors that cannot drive 
stay at the EMERGE building or support in other 
ways instead. Ramsay sometimes feels “discour­
aged” because he cannot help the team by driving.


Currently, Ramsay is working on securing his 
Social Security card in order to apply for a state iden­
tification card, and eventually a driver’s license.


Ramsay wakes up around 4 a.m. and starts his 
day with a prayer before getting ready for it. By 6 a.m., 
he’s off on the ten-minute walk from his West Haven 
home to the bus stop. He leaves the house early to 
give himself time in case the bus is early. Ramsay 
takes the 265 to the New Haven Green, a ten to fif­
teen minute ride, and then walks another thirteen 
minutes to EMERGE’s headquarters. He is a supervisor 
now, and makes sure to be there before 7 a.m. The 
total commute takes about forty-five minutes.


If Ramsay had a car, the commute would be 
about fifteen minutes. But in the year since he was 


immy Robinson is learning how to use 
the Uber app in Claire’s Corner Copia. 
Dressed in a newsboy cap, a pink jacket, and 
a plaid button-down, he looks at his phone 
skeptically. His friend Annie Nisenson 
managed to secure him a $100 voucher for the app, 
and she leans over his shoulder to show him how 
to navigate it. Apps like Uber are new to Robinson; 
in fact, most are new to him. Robinson was serv­
ing life without parole before an unexpected pardon 
culminated with his release in 2021. He recalls the 
length of his incarceration exactly: forty years, seven 
months and two hours.


Robinson is used to taking the bus to work each 
morning. His bus is supposed to come at ten minutes 
to six. Sometimes the bus comes early, sometimes 
late, Robinson says. But he tries to make it to the 
bus stop at a good time for him to arrive at work on 
time no matter what—he works at EMERGE, an orga­
nization that supports clients through a 
variety of reintegration programs post-in­
carceration, as a shop manager.


Instead of using tools like the CT 
Transit app to support him in navigating 
the bus system, he has learned by mem­
orization and trial-and-error. He knows 
the phone number to call about bus status, 
and does so when necessary.


Robinson, however, will soon have no 
need for the Uber or CT Transit app. In 
October 2022, he was able to secure his 
learner’s permit. He’s preparing for his road 
test so he can finally receive his license.


His license will be a badge of honor, 
an accomplishment that many people in 
the process of reintegration struggle to 
acquire. Connecticut’s most recently avail­
able data from the National Institute of 
Corrections suggests that as of December 
31, 2019, 36,475 residents are on probation 
and 3,651 are under parole. For most of 
these residents, transportation—every­
thing from navigating public transport 
to securing a license—is a major barrier
to reintegration.


W
hen Andrew Ramsay began his sentence,
it was 1991. When he came back home, it was 2021.
Since returning, Ramsay has had to learn how 
to navigate public transportation in New Haven. 
Ramsay noted that his family has helped him, but 
that he initially depended on Uber so as not to “dis­
rupt” their lives. He stopped using Uber because 
the app’s surge pricing left a dent in his paychecks. 
Currently, he switches between public transportation 
and having a friend drive him.


“Everything is all brand new, so it’s like I’m 
a baby. I’m starting all over again,” Ramsay says. 
He speaks eloquently about the difficult pro­
cess of securing the required documents to 
acquire a license, emphasizing that he keeps faith
and patience.


“I pay my taxes. I’m 
working. I’m doing 
all these things.
And to this day, I’m 
still struggling 
right now to get my 
documentation,” 
Ramsay says. This 
documentation is 
not just essential for 
transportation—
identification is often 
required to apply for 
housing, banking, 
and healthcare.


It can be incredibly difficult to get a job 
post-incarceration, especially with the increase in 
national unemployment since the start of the COVID-
19 pandemic, not to mention the usual obstacles for 
formerly-incarcerated people—employer prejudice, 
lack of educational degrees, and a lack of the docu­
mentation necessary to be added to someone’s pay­
roll, for example.


The court’s expectation for formerly incarcerated 
people is to integrate immediately, requiring weekly 
proof of job searches to be sent to their probation 
officers, noted Hannah Duncan, the Curtis-Liman 
fellow at Yale Law School’s Arthur Liman Center for 
Public Interest Law. This creates pressure to accept 
any offer at all—even if the job is far away or has odd 
hours. Duncan herself has managed cli­
ents who commute for hours to get to and 
from their job.


In the federal system, supervised 
release or probation can be part of a sen­
tence, and those under these must still 
report to a probation officer. Violating 
conditions of their release from custody 
as part of their probation or supervised 
release can mean you get sent back to 
jail—full-time employment is often 
a condition of release from custody, 
Duncan says. Full-time employment 
being a condition often leads to accepting 
the first job offer you get. On top of this, 
it is immensely frowned upon to reject 
offers in the face of so many job applica­
tion rejections.


On top of the burden of finding a job 
is finding one accessible through pub­
lic transportation. With no car and no 
flexible income to afford ride-share apps 
or taxis, formerly incarcerated people 
depend on buses, trains, bicycles, or walk­
ing to get to and from work. 


The New Haven bus system is run by 
the Connecticut Department of Transportation, and 
is free to ride for now, as the state legislature recently 
extended a free bus policy until April. Ramsay 
describes the bus system as “O.K.” The buses can be 
inconsistent, so he opts for the walk from the New 
Haven Green to EMERGE.


Unless people get jobs on a bus line, they need a 
car. But, for the formerly incarcerated, getting a car is 
painfully difficult.


T
he majority of Connecticut residents—
more than three fourths—drive alone to 
work, but formerly incarcerated people struggle 
not only to secure a car, but also a permit, license,
and registration. 


Much of this struggle boils down to the same 
thing: applicants need documents that people who 
have not been away from home for prolonged peri­
ods of time tend not to have. And they cost money 
to get.


In order to secure an identification from the state 
of Connecticut, applicants must show three catego­
ries of documents: proof of identity, proof of a Social 
Security number, and proof of Connecticut residency. 
Proof of identity should include at least one 
“primary document.” For U.S.-born citizens, “primary 
documents” must be a birth certificate or a passport. 
Alden Woodcock, EMERGE’s Executive Director, 
notes that unless a family member saves your Social 
Security card and birth certificate for you while incar­
cerated, it is incredibly difficult to secure a state-issued 
identification card. According to Connecticut 211, a 
human and social services resource, personal docu­
ments obtained during intake or incarceration are 
stored in “a secure location” at each correctional facility.


Nonetheless, Robinson notes that there is a 
lot of “poor management” and that his 
Social Security card was lost during his 
incarceration. 


Even if a family member is able to 
hold onto your documents, this might 
not be enough, depending on the length 
of the sentence. Illness, death, and other 
unprecedented factors can affect whether 
family or friends have been able to hold 
onto them—the longer the sentence, the 
older parents and family members get 
and the more likely illness or death has 
affected them.


For Ramsay, who is a U.S. citizen but 
was born in Jamaica, the process of secur­
ing a birth certificate was even harder. His 
mother formerly had his documentation, 
but she passed away during his sentence 
and his documents were lost. Ramsay has 
been making lots of phone calls and send­
ing lots of emails to gather the documents 
he needs to prove that he is a U.S. citizen.


“I pay my taxes. I’m working. I’m 
doing all these things. And to this day, 
I’m still struggling right now to get my 
documentation,” Ramsay says. This doc­
umentation is not just essential for transportation 
identification is often required to apply for housing, 
banking, and healthcare.


To request a birth certificate, applicants must go 
to the town vital records where they were born, the 
town of their mother’s residence at the time of birth, 
or the State Vital Records Office. In order to request 
it, they must fill out an application and mail it, along 
with a government-issued photo identification, and a 
payment of $30 per copy. 


In Ramsay’s case, he had to contact the Jamaican 
government and pay for his birth certificate to be 
sent to Connecticut. So far, this is all he has been 
able to secure in order to demonstrate proof of iden­
tity and citizenship, but is still in need of his Social 
Security Card. 


Alongside a birth certificate as primary doc­
umentation, you can show a passport at the DMV.
