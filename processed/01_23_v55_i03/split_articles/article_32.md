another, her long hair spills over her 
shoulder as she leans over to kiss a boy 
on the cheek. The person in the photos 
was twenty pounds lighter, more delicate, 
more feminine, and very, very straight.
No one else in my family has a tat­
too. When I was mulling over my first 
tattoo, my mother lamented to me that 
no one would hire me if I got one. I had 
to reassure her that the only occupations 
I could foresee banning tattoos were 
preschool teachers and the Navy, and I 
had no intention of joining either. But 
I could understand her ambivalence. In 
the weeks ahead of my appointment, 
questions swarmed in my mind. What if 
I don’t like the way it looks on my body? 
What will happen when I’m older, when 
my skin sags and swells, when the ink 
blurs and fades? I shuddered to imag­
ine the wrinkles forming around those 
two fish, their bellies slowly bulging and 
bloating along with my own.

Getting a tattoo is a dull, monoto­
nous pain, like getting stung by a micro­
scopic bee over and over again—only, the 
bee is actually a thin needle puncturing 
your skin up to three thousand times per 
minute. When the needle punctures your 
dermis, the second layer of your skin, and 
injects a spout of ink, your body sends 
white blood cells to attack the foreign 
particles. But tattoo particles are larger 
than the particles white blood cells can 
dispose of, so the ink remains. A tattoo 
is a wound you wear forever. I thought of 
this as the artist moved the needle to the 
thickest, most fleshy part of my shoulder, 
as I closed my eyes and felt the machine 
buzz into my skin.


Although Sam’s workspace in 
Broken Crystal, like the rest of the 
store, is a shock of colors and trinkets, 
it serves a utilitarian purpose too. On a 
simple black shelf, miniature figurines 
of monkeys, unicorns, and skeletons 
stand with the order and obedience 
of a newly conscripted army among 
sterilized needles, gauze pads, and 
Vaseline. Among their ranks is a dried 
out orange peel, preserved proudly in a 
glass case. There are faint black scratches 
shaped like fish and flowers on its side, 
likely some of Sam’s earliest etchings.

In her sanitized, well-organized nook, 
Sam is showing a custom design that she 
drew on her iPad to Tatiana, her client 
today. Tatiana, like most clients, found 
Broken Crystal by asking around for 
good queer tattoo artists in the area. The 
design is rather bare bones, without the 
shading and detail that Sam will include 
later. Flowers are one of Sam’s specialties; 
she can usually draw them from memory.

After Tatiana approves the design, 
Sam prints out a stencil version on car­
bon-based paper in washable ink. The 
stencil is what’s used to determine the 
tattoo’s placement, and what the artist 
ultimately traces over during the actual 
tattooing. Sam shaves Tatiana’s calf and 
disinfects it, and reaches past her collec­
tion of Dr. Seuss-themed bobbleheads 
for a thick, purple gooey substance. She 
applies the goo generously to the sten­
cil on Tatiana’s leg. When she peels it 
away, we see the final design: a delicate 
sunflower, its stem a trail of cursive spell­
ing out the name of Tatiana’s late aunt. 
Sam has watched clients decide on one 
placement, then decide it was too high, 
then too low, then too off-center, before 
concluding that their original placement 
was ideal all along. But Sam is always 
patient. “I want people to feel comfort­
able with whatever goes on their bodies,” 
Sam insists. Thankfully, Tatiana likes the 
initial placement too.

Watching Sam work, I learn that tat­
tooing is a lot like painting, and Sam, a 
lifelong artist who attended an arts high 
school, is a practiced impressionist. She 
first makes a gentle outline of the sun­
flower on Tatiana’s leg, carefully and 
slowly tracing out the hair-thin stem, 
each folded petal. She uses a handheld 
needle—not one of the heavy, traditional 
needles connected to a power outlet 
that shakes when you turn the voltage 
higher—because it feels like using a light 
paintbrush. Once the black outline is 
down, she goes in with the colors, start­
ing with the lightest shade and moving 
to the darkest, easing them into the skin 
like slow, weighty watercolors.

Sam tells me, much to my surprise, 
that she suffers from carpal tunnel syn­
drome. Her hand tenses up sometimes, 
which can make tattooing rather uncom­
fortable. When she tattoos, her vivacious, 
effervescent expressions grow more sub­
dued. She quietly and steadily holds the 
tattoo gun in place, applying brief dabs of 
Vaseline to make sure the ink enters the 
skin seamlessly. She checks in regularly 
with her clients—“You hanging in there? 
Does that hurt?”—before returning to 
her work with intense focus. She tells me 
that she hates seeing her clients in pain. 
“I hate hurting people,” she admits, “even 
though that’s my job.”

Sam remembers the pain of her first 
tattoo too vividly. She had just turned 
18, and her parents had finally let her get 
that ambitious tattoo she had wanted for 
a long time: a giant, multicolored dream 
catcher that encircled her back, inspired 
by Disney’s Pocahontas. “You know, 
‘Colors of the Wind’ and blue corn moon 
and all of that stuff?” she reminisces.

The full color tattoo took around 
three hours to complete. It felt like a 
hot knife going into her back the entire 
time. The male artist was a family friend. 
“Everything about it was awful. There 
was metal music playing, skulls every­
where, and the guy’s got a big bike out­
side, bulldogs in front,” Sam groans. 
“He’s got greased-back hair, tattoos 
everywhere, like the most cliché tattoo 
shop you could possibly go to. And of 
all the names, the shop was called, like, 
COMMITMENT.” She spits out the 
word dramatically.

“Why did you choose to get more 
tattoos?” I ask. “Thirty-four more, to be 
exact?”

“It’s like having a kid,” she says non­
chalantly. “No one likes being pregnant. 
No one likes [childbirth], but you like 
[kids] when they’re 18 and out of your 
house. And then they’re here to save 
you later.”


The word “tattoo” comes from the 
Tahitian word “ta-tu,” meaning to 
write or mark, which is what Indigenous 
communities in the Pacific Islands 
had been doing for generations before 
European colonization. For Indigenous 
peoples, tattoos served more than an 
aesthetic purpose. They were protective 
talismans, or even permanent, corpo­
real genealogies, each one marking an 
individual’s social status and lineage. 
Eighteenth-century Europeans, how­
ever, found these exquisite markings 
of animals, patterns, and nature to be 
primitive—albeit fascinating—oddities. 
Colonizers captured tattooed men and 
women to display at world’s fairs, plac­
ing them in “human zoos” where other 
Europeans could gawk at the savagery of 
the lesser known, un-Christian parts of 
the world. Sandwiched between exhib­
its boasting the latest models of steam 
engines, or other novel tools of industri­
alization, these human zoos completed 
stadial theories of evolution. The tattoo 
was understood as a feature of the “unciv­
ilized Other,” whose body was made 
purely for public consumption, asserting 
the superiority of the Western world.

The public perception of tattooing in 
the West changed with the invention of 
the tattoo machine, which made tattoo­
ing less time-consuming and more acces­
sible. Around the same time, Western 
powers set up formal military outposts 
in the Pacific, placing male soldiers in 
Asia. Many returned home with dragons, 
geishas, military insignia, flags, or even 
“MOM,” or a fiancé’s name written in an 
obnoxiously red heart. The practice grew 
in popularity and spread among veterans, 
working class men, the Chicano move­
ment, biker gangs, and queer subcultures. 
Suddenly, tattoos had new, subversive 
meanings: they were marks of survival, 
resilience, pride, and resistance against a 
world that marked you as Other.

When I first discovered the queer 
tattooing scene, I was surprised by the 
number of queer artists, especially artists 
of color, who were committed to unset­
tling tattooing stereotypes. Like Sam, 
they weren’t interested in abiding by 
overly masculine, Orientalist, or con­
spicuously white and Western tattoo 
traditions. Their designs were thin and 
detailed, inspired by Gothic design, tra­
ditional Korean and Chinese artwork, 
queer subcultures—anything counter-
hegemonic. They wore their tattoos 
proudly. When I turned 21 and started 
visiting queer bars and clubs in New 
York City, I noticed, alongside mullets 
and ripped tops, arms and legs covered 
in monochromatic and colorful designs.

At the same time, I began delving 
into feminist and queer theory, tak­
ing in ideas that celebrated body mod­
ification as a subversive act. I began to 
understand my body as a site for my 
politics, and a site where difference is 
made apparent and celebrated. Perhaps 
this is what I wanted when I got my first 
tattoo, then another, and another: to 
destroy and incinerate my straight body, 
to coax out a new visibly and conspic­
uously queer body—the one I had hid­
den for so long by growing out my hair, 
painting my nails, throwing up, starving 
myself, wearing bodycon dresses, and 
sleeping with men. I, too, hoped that 
tattoos would save me. As I walked out 
of the studio last August and passed my 
hand over the fresh wound of my new 
tattoo, I traced the two fishes, wanting 
to feel like a phoenix breathing in its 
first breath of air.


In her senior year of college, Sam 
realized she was developing feelings for 
her roommate. It was something she had 
never really experienced before. “Great 
times, like Stockholm syndrome,” she 
concedes, rolling her eyes. “I just liked 
them because I was around them so god­
damn much.” She finally decided it was 
time to come out, though she had known 
for a long time that she wasn’t attracted 
to men. In high school, she avoided dat­
ing anyone. While her friends talked 
about their school crushes, she shud­
dered at the thought of kissing a boy.

I empathize with many moments 
in Sam’s coming out journey. There was 
the ambivalence toward most men who 
hit on her, the general lack of interest in 
presenting as overly feminine, and the 
one very intense female “friendship” in 
high school that had turned out to be 
a blatantly obvious crush, followed by a 
similarly intense friendship breakup. “I 
mean, I showed up to this girl’s doorstep 
on Valentine’s Day with frickin’ flowers 
and a teddy bear,” Sam says, cringing.

Sam passed as a straight woman for 
most of her life. She grew up in a com­
munity and went to a university where 
she was one of few queer women. She 
wore her hair long, donned shape­
less, unremarkable clothes, and tried to 
look the least Sam as possible. She was 
even voted prom queen, an irony she 
acknowledges with a chuckle. It wasn’t 
until she opened Broken Crystal that 
she started to meet and make queer 
friends. She started presenting as a 
hundred-footer, with collared shirts, a 
whiff of short hair, and arms full of tat­
toos. She started dating a woman—Sara, 
her girlfriend of over four years—and 
buzzed away her hair.

When I ask her if she noticed people 
treating her differently after she came 
out, she tells me about an encounter she 
had with a Christian proselytizer when 
she worked at Walmart a few years ago. 
The proselytizer had noticed Sam’s col­
orful half-sleeves and remarked that tat­
toos are not “what God wants.” Enraged, 
Sam told the woman that she had a pair 
of demon wings inked on her back—and 
she was going to tattoo her face next.

“I’m going to Hell for a lot worse 
than my tattoos,” Sam laughs. “I’m 
gonna go down for being frickin’ gay.”


On one of my visits to Sam, I 
noticed that she has a tattoo of 
two overlapping cards on her left arm. 
The first card read: “THIS TATTOO 
IS PERMANENT.” The second, “THIS 
BODY IS TEMPORARY.” 

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“This? Oh, I just thought it was funny,” 
she started, then paused for a moment. 
“But my whole thing is: if you want it, you 
want it. If you want a tattoo just because 
it looks cool, go for it. It’s a memory. 
Obviously there are some stupid tattoos, 
but people do stupid things every day. I 
mean, I’m driving a Jeep every day.” She 
gestured wildly to said vehicle in the 
parking lot. “Them shits flip.”

“People are obsessed with making 
their tattoos perfect because it stays on 
your body forever, and then I have to 
explain to them that their bodies are not 
perfect to begin with. But that’s okay—
it’s good to have your tattoos a little bit 
crooked, because our bodies are a little 
bit crooked. There’s something comfort­
ing to me about that permanence.”


For my last visit to Broken Crystal, 
I decide that I want a new tattoo. I 
don’t think much about it as I wait in 
front of the studio on a bright, crisp 
November morning. I’m just feeling a 
cool flower at the moment, or some­
thing of the sort. My mind jumps to the 
flower that shares a name with the first 
woman I dated.

Sam pulls up in her olive green Jeep. 
She steps out of the car with Sara, her 
girlfriend, whom Sam wants me to meet.

The three of us spend the morn­
ing chatting in the shop as Sam tat­
toos me. Sam first cleans the sensitive 
inside part of my forearm, placed on an 
armrest, with her usual tenderness and 
care, and the light from the curtains 
casts flashes of color on our skin. As the 
needle hits my skin, Sam and Sara talk 
about some of their nightmarish room­
mates—including a woman who let 
her giant pet rabbits shit all over their 
house—and it almost makes me forget 
about the dull pain in my arm. It feels 
nice to not be in reporter mode, to just 
listen and laugh.

“I think that’s done,” Sam finally says. 
She dabs Vaseline, wipes it gently with a 
paper towel to reveal the finished piece. 
“Do you like it?”

I look down at the detailed, refined 
stem, the petals curling so realistically—
as if scorched, briefly, by sunlight. I do. ∎
