EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Africans were among new haven’s 
first settlers, the archival papers 
read. They say that she was “the first 
African of which there is any record,” that 
her name was Lucretia. 1638 is the year that 
she arrived, where she lived in Governor 
Theophilus Eaton’s estate and tended to 
twenty-one fireplaces and over thirty res­
idents, raising up Elihu Yale himself. In a 
ninety-one-page paper titled “The Hist ori­
cal Status of the Negro on Connecticut” by 
William C. Fowler, it is said that Lucretia 
died happy and content and married to 
her husband John Cram, and grew old on 
two acres of land parceled out from Eaton’s 
property.

If you search online for Lucretia and 
manage to find her, each result will repeat 
the words of Fowler’s work when describ­
ing her. Whether it be the “Records of the 
Colony and Plantation of New Haven, 
from 1638 to 1649” or an 1899 article in 
Connecticut Magazine titled “Negro Slavery 
in Connecticut,” Lucretia and her husband 
are always parceled out no more than a sin­
gle mention, the subject of a sentence. The 
sentences all amount to something like this: 
They were people enslaved to Governor 
Theophilus Eaton who “grew old and stub­
born and eventually died happy and content 
on their allotted two acres of ground.”

Twice more Lucretia can be found 
online, once in a 1646 court transcript and 
another time in “The Public Records of the 
Colony of Connecticut, from August, 1689 
to May, 1706.” The latter collection lends 
context that Eaton had given Lucretia and 
John Cram the two acres of land because 
they were growing “old and troublesome.” 
In the former, Lucretia isn’t described on a 
broad scale, but in her actions. Mentioned 
once in the transcript, she is presented as a 
witness against Thomas Hogg, an enslaved 
resident of the Eaton estate accused of bes­
tiality and theft. Each time Lucretia is found, 
it is only in conjunction with another name.

Dr. Ann E. Garrett Robinson, a writer, 
researcher, and former professor of psy­
chology at Gateway Community College, 
says that she just “kind of stumbled upon 
Lucretia.” While conducting research in 
1997 for a new museum on schooling for 
African American children in the Prince 
Hall Masonic Temple, she came across the 
historical papers that read that Africans were 
among New Haven’s first settlers. Lucretia, 
the papers claimed, was “the first African of 
which there is any record” in New Haven.

“Her name seemed to echo on that 
page,” Dr. Robinson said, after a long pause. 
In the twenty-five years since she first read 
the name Lucretia, Dr. Robinson—now 89 
years old—has been searching to complete 
more of her story.

“Throughout 
my 
whole 
life 
I’ve 
looked toward opening doors,” she told 
me. “Having attended an all-Black school 
as a child and throughout my high school 
career, I’ve always had to. Had to be the 
first, couldn’t wait on nobody.” Had to be, 
she declared over the phone, as if in a single 
moment these stories, part of her larger his­
tory, could slip between her fingers.

She has devoted much of her life 
to championing and reconstructing the 
lives of those who came before her. In 
1982, her dissertation research on Booker 
T. Washington’s three wives was cited in 
Ebony Magazine. The article attributes 
her with “playing a major role in focusing 
public attention on the forgotten wives of 
Washington.” In all of her work, she reaches 
back into the past, cultivating counternar­
ratives for the lives that were reduced to 
single lines within historical records. These 
stories, entangled with her own, beat out a 
steady drum: “We cannot be forgotten,” Dr. 
Robinson insists.

In an attempt to bring Lucretia back 
into the public memory, Dr. Robinson has 
spoken out about the importance of pub­
lic representations of Lucretia’s name. “We 
need to name a building in her name, we 
need to name a school in her name . . . ” Dr. 
Robinson declared back in an April 2022 
radio interview on Dateline New Haven.

Steve Winter—Dr. Robinson’s friend 
and then-alderman for Ward 21—worked 
with her to try to honor Lucretia. Together, 
they drafted a petition to have the corner 
renamed. The petition required at least 250 
signatures for approval, two-thirds of which 
had to come from the neighborhood sur­
rounding the petitioning area. The neigh­
borhood expands into the greater part of 
Downtown New Haven and includes most 
Yale students.

Winter and Dr. Robinson found 
the bulk of their supporters by knocking 
on doors in the McQueeney Towers on 
Orange Street, a public housing devel­
opment for senior and disabled residents. 
After quickly collecting the required 250 
signatures, the pair took the issue to the
