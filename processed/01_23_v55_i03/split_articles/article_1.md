Dear readers,
We’d like to greet you with a goodbye. Specifically, take care.
Take care is a promise willed to the departing. It means keep yourself safe and
pay attention. Volume 55, Issue 3 of The New Journal follows people and 
communities who intimately understand what it means to fulfill this promise, 
and when a promise isn’t enough. Formal systems of support can fail to help 
individuals, so informal systems—from personal networks to strangers who 
want to help—step up to take care when those established channels fall short. 
In this issue, communities take the wheel, literally.
“Reintegration Roadblocks” follows an organization that supports people 
reintegrating post-incarceration to overcome the innumerable hurdles on 
the road to getting a driver’s license; while, in “Scrap Cycling,” a writer cycles 
after the man behind Peels on Wheels—a start-up filling in for New Haven’s 
landfill-dependency by collecting neighborhood food scraps on his bike.
In our cover story, students make the game-time decision for their friends in 
alcohol-induced emergencies: either call 9-1-1—sinking their friends into the 
debt induced by an uninsured ambulance trip—or hang up to take care of the 
emergency themselves. “It’s not right,” Chief Perez says when our Executive 
Editor Jesse Goodman speaks to him. “We’re supposed to take care of each 
other.”
It doesn’t stop there. In one story, we see a woman spend decades fighting to 
build public memory of Lucretia, an enslaved woman who is believed to be
the first Black resident of New Haven. In another, the crowds brought 
together by the Elm City Express come back to life, with wins shared both 
among the players and the city alike. In “This Tattoo Is Permanent,” clients’ 
queer identities and permanent ink collide as modes of rebellion, thanks to 
the work of a queer tattoo artist. And, in the endnote, a man tends to the 
pianos in the School of Music one string at a time, the quiet enabler of the 
thrum of the ivories at hundreds of concerts.
We’d like to thank the writers, editors, copy editors, designers, Photography 
Head Lukas Flippo, and Creative Director Kevin Chen for the tremendous 
amount of care they put into this issue. Our collective promise is this issue, 
which we now depart, and leave to you. 
Take care,
The Managing Board
