Essay
M
y favorite photo Reese has 
taken of me is the one posted to 
his Instagram in between frag­
mented shots of his body. I’m applying 
my favorite red lipstick, staring into a 
silver hand mirror in the warm lighting 
of my old freshman dorm in Welch Hall. 
He’s captioned it, “this is my body bro­
ken for you, or whatever.” When I ask 
him about it, he gleefully tells me it’s a 
reference to the Bible, when Jesus offers 
his body as the wine and bread of com­munion. Corinthians 11:24: Take, eat; this 
is My body which is broken for you. “Oh my 
God,” Reese exclaims, “that goes so hard. 
I wish I thought of that!” 

I don’t think that it was intentional 
for Reetse to place me in the midst of 
his broken body, but I love to think of 
myself there. Once, I wrote to my friend 
Jabez that in his eyes I was broken and 
remade into the image of a new God. To 
me, this is what it means to have queer 
friends. Or more like, this is what it is 
to recognize yourself in someone. Here 
is my body, broken for you. In between the 
fragments of our bodies and Gods lie our 
hearts and the art that comes from them. 
As queers, we are reimagining it all—and 
in these bodies, we find something holy. 

I was not raised religious. I spent 
the last summer wandering through­
out Italy, learning about saints and their 
golden sins. In every Catholic church, 
there was the bloodied body of Christ 
hung for all to see, his weeping mother 
posited even higher. I carried bad luck 
with me all that summer and wondered 
if the tombs of the priests I had so care­
lessly walked over could sense my irrev­
erence. Even worse was my treatment of 
the Sistine Chapel. You’re not supposed 
to take pictures, but I did anyways. All 
those glorious man-bodies, bulging 
with cheek and muscle. I wondered if I 
was going to Hell. I posted them to my 
Instagram and wrote, I love queer people. I 
hope you all live long, beautiful lives. I hope 
the journey is abundant and kind. I hope you 
find your people. I hope it’s everything you 
wanted and more.

All this to say that I am painting a 
new kind of citizenship here. I am re-
imagining God in the image of an erotic, 
homosexual, and queer personhood. I 
hope you will forgive my irreverence.

This is not to say that Reese is a god. 
Reese is queer. Reese is Jewish. Reese is 
from Texas. Reese loves Houston. We 
share a love for gold jewelry. He loves 
his mother and his older sister, Georgia. 
I can say all of these things, but it is hard 
to impart what I really think embodies 
Reese, the parts of him that aren’t so 
easy to compartmentalize. A smooth, 
low-hanging voice. Slim-fingered hands 
he throws up in the air like someone’s 
exasperated Southern grandmother, half 
prayer and half surrender. And then 
there’s what could only be his: a kind of 
shining generosity, one that can’t help 
but spill over his fingertips and into the 
art he makes.

The photographer’s gaze is often 
a site of transaction; to desire a certain 
shot, to capture a moment and steal its 
private passing, can be a selfish or twisted 
act. But Reese’s warmth is inescapable in 
his shots—every subject is given some­
thing precious, a certain beauty we can 
witness only through his gaze. He tells 
me that striving to capture that warmth 
in his subjects “was always the sentence 
I was trying to write. That I couldn’t find 
the words for. I feel like I finally found 
my stride . . . with capturing this feeling 
of softness and warmth and romanticism 
that I associate with my home and the 
people that I love and the people that 
make me feel safe.” 

There are dozens of his photographs 
that come to mind when he says this—
his sister haloed in golden light and peer­
ing through a shredded window screen, 
a Mona Lisa-esque smile on her face. 
The regal grace of his mother as she sits 
astride her horse, the gentle blue back­
drop of a Texan twilight behind her. That 
first photo from my freshman dorm, 
and the sureness I felt in his gaze 
behind me as he witnessed 
and captured a moment I
felt beautiful. 

He continues. “A 
lot of my photogra­
phy has shifted to 
those moments of 
feeling good. If 
you go back and 
read my essays, 
in any piece of 
art that I pro­
duce, I have 
this fascination 
with this very 
somatic 
feel­
ing of warmth, 
of 
wetness. . . . I 
think it’s a sensa­
tion that makes me 
feel safe. That essay 
about Houston starts 
out with ‘thick, fleshy 
one-ness.’ 

That’s 
the 
closest thing I’ve come to
describing it.” 

I think of an interview I once 
read with poet Ocean Vuong, where 
he wrote: Is it possible for queer joy—out­
sider-hood—to be so mundane that, in that 
simplicity, it’s radical? To insist that this joy 
does not have to end in tragedy, in death, in 
loss? We can just simply sit at a table and be 
okay for the next five minutes. I think of 
the photos Reese captures of his loved 
ones—wherein we are well and whole. 
We are fragmented and united. Our 
untethered, rehumanized beauty is rad­
ical. We have all the warmth of a home. 

On this Reese and I agree: queer­
ness is a mode, an ethic. Brimming with 
sexuality, but also a descriptor for the 
ways in which queer, erotic autonomy 
defies the goals of the nation-state. His 
art is a production of this philosophy, of 
desire manifested and realized. As the 
soft, pink light of our common room 
shines over his pale hands, he says to me: 
“Photography is about aesthetics. What 
you see, what you envision. I’ve always 
been attracted to, obviously, men. But 
that used to be something so shameful 
and painful for me. I think art started 
as a way to navigate those feelings . . . the 
fact that I was attracted to these men, 
these male bodies and male forms, 
became a source of inspiration . . . It was 
about reclaiming the things I’ve always 
wanted to take pictures of. I’ve always 
wanted to look at men.”

Now I am offering you my own 
remembrance. I remember being a queer 
child and growing up feeling part-pred­
ator. I wonder how it left its mark—
thinking I was half-human. I craved 
love. I still do. Love, full and whole. I 
was always really good at that. I give it 
to other people fast and easy, just the way 
I like it. I love the ritual of it. I love the 
act of honoring, of desire and its release; 
I love the moment of yes, yes I will do 
this, I will do it again and again and 
again until I am filthy with it. These are 
the echoes of a childhood spent seeking 
love. These are the manifestations of our 
very human desire.

Queerness is a lifeforce, a freedom. 
Desire is a long-held wish. And pride is 
still protest. We are still freeing ourselves, 
still forging the world in which our 
desires are no longer paid for in blood.

If I could write my own version of a 
Corinthians-like prayer, it would begin like 
this: here lies the flesh, the body, the reck­
oning of its blood and warmth. We are not 
Jesus Christ’s bloodied body hanging from 
the church walls, but his still-living desire. I 
will not invoke the familiar sins. I am tired 
of blood; I’ve grown weary of sacrifice. I 
am realizing that not everything is a 
loss. I am holding the peace with 
me, reveling in the sound of a 
heartbeat both warm and 
wild; I am realizing that 
my heart was looking 
for friends like Reese 
for a long, long time.

We 
should 
all be so lucky 
to have queer 
friends. 

Queer 
people 
make the good 
art and embrace 
their 
friends 
and be radically 
happy, 
merrily 
and 
religiously 
relentlessly. 

Singer 
Phoebe 
Bridgers 
said, 
I 
wanted to see the world 
through your eyes until it 
happened. But my friend, 
I want to see the world 
through your eyes if only to 
see the beauty you render it. I 
want the world to see what I see, too.

I sometimes think that in fifty years, 
when our bones have dried up, I’ll crawl 
into that good place and find a field of 
golden hay, a slim-fingered hand waiting 
to guide us to its center. There will be a 
big round table, oak and sturdy, and we 
won’t remember things like the open 
wound of our queerness or who we used 
to be. I’ll feel a touch on my shoulder and 
turn to see the face of my old friend, and 
feel for a second what it used to be like 
in the warmth of his gaze. We will talk 
with our companions and laugh for hours. 
There are no gods. Not really. Not here. ∎
