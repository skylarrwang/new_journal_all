Points of Departure
Scrap Cycling
D
omingo Medina, owner and foun-
der of Peels & Wheels Composting, 
surveys the heap of food waste before 
him. Over a thousand pounds of 
rejected leftovers are spread in a neat 
rectangle at his feet, the sweet smell 
of decay punching through the win­
ter chill. His son, Noah, shoos his 
dog away from a banana peel. One 
employee scours the pile for still-edi­
ble melons and potatoes to take home. 
Another wades into the garbage, pick­
ing out stray pieces of plastic and com­
post bin liners.

Medina grabs a shovel to start turn­
ing the pile as he tells me about his com­
posting setup.
“It’s all human-scale,” he says. “It 
doesn’t require any machinery, just labor 
force.”

Medina is the brains and one-sixth 
of the brawn behind Peels & Wheels, 
New Haven’s bike-based composting 
service. For $7.50 per pickup, Medina 
and his five employees will collect your 
food scraps and pedal them to a small 
facility by the Mill River where orange 
rinds and eggshells slowly turn back into 
soil for local farms and gardens. Since its 
founding in 2014, Peels & Wheels has 
diverted over one hundred and ninety 
thousand pounds of food waste.

I joined Medina for his Monday 
pickup route on a blustery morning in 
December. It took a while for him to 
confirm our meeting point: “My refer­
ences are trees, doors, corners, not num­
bers,” he told me.

His process, though, he knows by 
heart. He coasts into each customer’s 
driveway, eyes peeled for the little green 
bin left on the porch or by the dumpster. 
He weighs the bucket with a portable 
scale, spins the top off with a practiced 
ease, and heaves its contents into one 
of the large black bins on his trailer, 
smacking the base to dislodge tenacious 
scraps. And then he bikes away to his 
next destination, his trailer fourteen or
so pounds heavier.

Medina rides a beast of a bicycle: 
bright orange with an electric assist, a 
heavy gray trailer, and tires as thick as my 
forearm. My gray road bike looks puny 
by comparison. Although Medina was 
dragging three hundred pounds of gar­
bage, I found myself racing to keep up 
as I followed him up Canner and down 
Orange, stopping at three consecutive 
houses on Whitney Avenue.

Our route reflected the business’s 
limited clientele. Peels & Wheels only 
accepts customers in East Rock, Prospect 
Hill, Wooster Square, Downtown New 
Haven, and Westville, plus Spring Glen 
and Whitneyville in Hamden—an eight 
mile radius covering some of the wealth­
iest parts of the region. The collection 
area doesn’t include the lower-income 
neighborhoods of Fair Haven, although 
that’s where the compost is processed, 
or Newhallville, even though it’s next to 
Prospect Hill.

Medina says he worries about these 
inequalities, but sees them as the inher­
ent limitations of running a business. 
It’s not that he doesn’t want to serve 
more neighborhoods, but that there 
aren’t enough people requesting his 
services. Weekly collection costs $30 a 
month (although about twenty off-cam­
pus Yale students get subsidized pickups 
through the Yale Student Environmental 
Coalition). Peels & Wheels is funded by 
its customers, so its customers are mostly 
people with funds to spare.

“I needed to do something that 
could pay for itself. I worked a long, long 
time for not-for-profits,” he told me. “It 
required me to write grants and to chase 
the money, and I got tired of it…I’m just 
not willing to get into boards, and meet­
ing every month, and trying to convince 
people. My time of convincing is done. 
For me, it’s about doing.”

Employee Austin Larkin takes a 
similar perspective. I chat with him 
while we hack discarded vegetables into 
pieces, increasing their surface area so 
they decompose faster. Larkin describes 
himself as a former “guerrilla composter” 
who used to bury his food waste in back­
yards and parks before he discovered 
Peels & Wheels.

“It felt very logical and also rad­
ical,” Larkin says as he jabs a hoe into 
a particularly sturdy carrot. “Obviously 
it’s not enough, but it’s also better than 
nothing. It’s what’s possible right now. 
And it’s not about finding an ideal, it’s 
about progress.”


Progress, though, might be difficult 
without more institutional support. Two 
years ago, New Haven’s Food System 
Policy Division received a $90,000 USDA 
grant, which it used to improve commu­
nity garden compost systems and start 
community composting working groups. 
But due to bureaucratic challenges, the 
Division failed to find city-owned land 
where they could start another food 
waste diversion site. Instead, they used 
the money to expand Common Ground 
High School’s compost facility (which 
Medina helped establish).

In general, local efforts at food 
waste management are “a little frag­
mented” and limited by budgetary con­
straints, according to Deborah Greig, 
Common Ground’s Farm Director. 
There are a handful of independent ini­
tiatives: in addition to Peels & Wheels, 
many restaurants contract with the 
Hartford-based scrap collector Blue 
Earth Compost, while Yale sends its 
dining hall discards to an anaerobic 
digestion facility in Southington. But 
there’s no citywide compost infrastruc­
ture, and no organizations devoted to 
helping interested residents develop 
composting skills.

“You need to have municipal-level 
compost. It almost doesn’t matter that 
there’s micro-haulers out there,” Greig 
said. “I think it’s impossible to create 
equity and access in education and com­
posting itself until there’s also a larger 
effort [by] the city.”

Medina agrees: he notes that Peels 
& Wheels is New Haven’s main home 
compost hauler, yet it only serves about 
five hundred households out of more 
than fifty thousand in the city. But he 
insists that a micro-scale approach can 
work on a municipal level. Most city­
wide compost systems, he says, rely on 
massive trucks and process food waste in
a central hub. They treat food waste as 
a “nuisance” to whisk away rather than a 
valuable good to return to local residents. 
He would prefer a decentralized network 
of compost haulers and processors, with 
programs like Peels & Wheels closing 
the loop in every zip code.

“Everybody sees my business like 
something cute,” he said. “But it’s also a 
demonstration that things can be done 
differently.”

Although Medina swears his opera­
tion is scalable, he is struggling to make 
it last. Right now, Peels & Wheels oper­
ates rent-free from the parking lot of 
sustainable printing company Phoenix 
Press, sweeping stray bits of food from 
the asphalt at the end of each process­
ing session. Local nonprofit New Haven 
Farms—which has since merged with 
the New Haven Land Trust to become 
Gather New Haven—grows crops in a 
small plot beneath the press’ wind tur­
bines, and Medina founded Peels & 
Wheels so that they could have free 
compost processed on site. But Phoenix 
Press’ owners are selling, and Medina 
has yet to find a new location.

Medina is not a melancholy man—
fist bumps are his preferred farewell ges­
ture—but as he ponders this dilemma, 
he turns pensive. Expanding the city’s 
compost systems requires broader con­
cern about food waste. But how do you 
get people to stop making their garbage 
someone else’s problem—to stop “push­
ing the wrinkle,” as Medina puts it?

He takes heart in the fact that he 
is providing a valuable service for his 
community. Peels & Wheels started, 
according to college freshman Noah, 
as “a notepad with five clients” and “a 
bunch of little containers all around 
the house.” Over the last nine years, his 
dad’s company has kept one hundred 
and ninety thousand pounds of food 
waste out of incinerators and created 
nearly sixteen thousand metric yards of 
soil-enriching compost.

And it doesn’t hurt that subscribers 
tend to be effusive in their gratitude.
“I tried [composting with] worms 
and unfortunately I filled my house 
with bugs and so Domingo’s service 
was a godsend when I learned about it,” 
Virginia Chapman, a Peels & Wheels 
customer and Director of Yale’s Office 
of Sustainability, said in an email. “I 
love the low carbon footprint (the 
wheels), the garden it was supporting, 
and the compost I get back every year 
for my garden.”

Besides, the job stays interesting. 
Most of what ends up in the compost 
bins is fairly standard—chopped vegeta­
bles, stale bread, the accidental piece of 
silverware. But when I ask Medina about 
the strangest thing he’s seen in a com­
post bin, he has an answer prepared.
“I honestly thought there was a 
woman that was trying to compost her 
husband,” Medina said.

Strands of hair and fingernail clip­
pings started showing up in her compost 
bin. Then shirts, then trousers.

Medina never saw any human 
limbs—and, as far as he knows, there 
were none to be disposed of. But if it 
weren’t aiding and abetting a murder, he 
says Peels & Wheels could have com­
posted them.
“We’ll take anything that’s organic…
animal or plant-based.” ∎
