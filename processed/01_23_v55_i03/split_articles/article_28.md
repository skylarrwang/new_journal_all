GETTING PEACE
OF MIND
“If we were to be able to expand that basic
plan to emergency coverage . . . then a student 
can have the peace of mind knowing that,
‘hey, if I need an ambulance’ or ‘hey, if my
friend needs to go to the E.R.,’ the bill is not 
something I’m going to have to worry about.”
ANDREW DU ’24, DEPUTY CHIEF OF OPERATIONS
FOR YALE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

W
hat could Yale do to protect its students from 
ambulance billing?
“I think the solution would be some type of 
financial assistance,” Shaun Heffernon, member 
of the Yale Emergency Medical Services board of 
advisors, told me.
Dr. McCarthy agreed. “I feel like it’s an insur­
ance question,” she said. “So the question is, should 
Yale––not Yale Health because that’s a different 
thing––should they cover ambulance transports?” 
As of the latest public disclosure, Yale has 
41.4 billion dollars in its endowment. As admin­
istrators persistently point out, spending that 
money is not as simple as writing a check. There’s 
a process required to free up money for university 
expenses. At the same time, the fact that Yale has 
more resources than all but one other educational 
institution on the planet, and more than a few 
countries, has led some students to wonder if the 
institution should not brave its own bureaucracy 
and make the funds available. 
“One trip to the emergency room is enough to 
put you in debt and wipe out your savings,” said 
Kyle. “They’re basically saying it’s O.K. for me to 
go through this, it’s ok for all these other students 
to go through this, just so they can save a buck.” 
Using some simple back-of-the-envelope cal­
culations, the amount of money required to cover 
emergency ambulance costs for students would be, 
for Yale, relatively little. The cost of an AMR ambu­
lance providing basic life support is about $1000. 
An ambulance providing Advanced Life Support 
can reach nearly $1700, not including mileage fees.
Neither Yale Health nor AMR disclosed to 
me how many ambulances are taken by Yale stu­
dents every year, but it is possible to reach a rough 
estimate by looking at a comparable institution 
that does. Brown University’s free ambulance 
program, according to publicly available data, 
receives approximately one thousand calls a year. 
Brown has about six hundred more undergradu­
ate students than Yale, so the number of rides at 
Yale College (assuming an equivalent amount of 
partying) would presumably be somewhat lower. 
But even if Yale students made exactly the same 
number of calls as Brown students; every one of 
those calls ended up in a transport; and every one 
of those transports incurred nearly the maximum 
charge of $2000, the total cost for the school 
would come out to two million dollars. 

Two million dollars is 0.0048 percent of Yale’s 
endowment; 4.7 percent of what Yale spent on 
library acquisitions in 2018; and 3.5 percent of what 
the University spent on athletics the same year. 
Presumably, if Yale were willing to reimburse 
the full bill, it would have no issue contracting 
with AMR or any other ambulance service. But 
even if Yale were unable to formally cover ambu­
lances under its Basic insurance, there are institu­
tional funds like Safety Net––a system designed 
to reimburse Yale students for unexpected funds 
related to their education––which could pay back 
the full ambulance cost directly to students. Safety 
Net representatives told me they offer “generous 
support” for high-need students who experience 
unexpected medical bills, but did not respond to 
requests for more information.


HARM REDUCTION
“I can’t imagine there’s anyone who [hasn’t 
hesitated to call an ambulance for a 
drunk friend]. I think anytime anybody seems 
too drunk, anytime anybody seems ill . . . 
whatever anybody will encounter, [they] really 
have to stop and think, should I call 911?” 
JOSIE STEUER INGALL


T
here are a myriad of reasons someone might 
need to go to the hospital––two of the students 
I talked to were involved in bike accidents, another 
experienced an allergic reaction. But overwhelm­
ingly, students told me they considered calling an 
ambulance due to acute intoxication.
On every college campus in every state in the 
country, students are going to drink. The ques­
tion is not how to prevent students from drink­
ing altogether, but how to ensure they do so safely. 
This has been Yale’s stated goal for over a decade: 
to reduce not just the physical harm of alcohol 
consumption on campus, but the financial, social, 
and mental harm as well. 
But Yale has so far made no move to address 
the prohibitive price of an ambulance. In some stu­
dents’ opinions, this oversight has not only placed 
them in danger, but violated Yale’s own stated 
intention of mitigating alcohol-related harms.
“I do think that Yale should cover ambu­
lance costs, especially considering that they 
teach freshman students to call their FroCos and 
they teach the FroCos to call Yale Health,” said
Lucy Santiago.
In addition to AODHRI, a one-stop shop for 
substance use education and resources, Yale has 
a number of other strategies to minimize the 
consequences of alcohol consumption. There are 
mandatory educational seminars during Camp 
Yale (Yale’s orientation week) to teach first year

students about safe drinking. There is Yale’s medi­
cal emergency policy, which ensures a student will 
not face disciplinary action if they call for medical 
attention. And there is Yale’s First Year Counselor 
(FroCo) program, which––operating with the 
the understanding that a first year student new 
to campus life is usually more vulnerable than an 
upperclassman––is designed to pair younger stu­
dents with a trusted older figure to help with the 
college transition, and in whom to confide.  
The formula Yale has worked out is intuitive. 
If they can educate their students on the danger of 
severe intoxication––thereby limiting the number 
of dangerous alcohol emergencies––and reduce 
barriers for accessing help, then students are posi­
tioned to navigate the complications of alcohol 
consumption at college with a full measure of 
protection.
But there is a gap in Yale’s harm reduction 
measures––a gap of no more than half of a mile 
or so, which separates a very drunk student from 
the safety of Yale Health or Yale New Haven 
Hospital. That half of a mile can represent hun­
dreds or even thousands of dollars; it can span 
the distance between happy parents and parents 
threatening sanctions. Most crucially, it can mea­
sure the difference between calling for emergency 
help, and braving it alone.
So long as this gap exists, some students 
believe, no combination of other Yale initiatives 
will fully protect them from the snowballing 
consequences of a single night’s binging. “It’s all 
bullshit,” said Will. “I didn’t feel like there was 
actually as many options as they say . . . and it feels 
a little bit deceitful.”
Online data from Yale’s Office of Institutional 
Research shows that 62 percent of Yale students, 
or approximately four thousand undergraduates, 
report binge drinking––that is, they consume 
four or more drinks (for women) or five or more 
drinks (for men) in a night. When someone binge 
drinks, they rapidly increase their risk of alcohol 
poisoning or alcohol-related injury, according 
to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. Despite this, only sixteen students 
were seen at Yale Health Acute Care in 2021 with 
the diagnosis “intoxication”.


DECISION-MAKING
“It’s like a Catch-22. If you call the ambulance, 
you’re risking completely setting him back in 
many different spheres in his life. Emotionally. 
Financially. Socially. If you don’t call, you are 
placing yourself as essentially God . . .
You [feel like] you have his life in your hands.” 
WILL CARRACIO ’25

I
n many scary medical situations, it can be 
hard to parse degrees of emergency––is this 
something I can sleep off, or is it life-threaten­
ing? This is especially true for intoxication. Two 
people who’ve had the same amount to drink, 
exhibiting the same symptoms, can suffer vastly
different consequences. 
This creates a quandary: the bystander’s 
dilemma. The psychological burden of deciding 
whether to call an ambulance for someone else––
the potential consequences of a wrong decision
––adds to the overall mental cost associated with 
ambulance billing. 
On the one hand, there may appear to be 
an imminent threat to someone’s health, or even 
their life. “When you’re scared and he’s vomiting 
or saying things that are scary and there’s adrena­
line and it’s all happening at once, you don’t have 
a clear head,” Will said. “Your mind automati­
cally goes to the worst scenario, which is this kid 
is going to die in my suite, and it’s going to be 
my fault.”
But sometimes calling for help might feel like 
the most threatening option. “I just would not 
want to put that cost on 
someone not knowing 
if they were going to 
be able to pay it,” said
How does one mea­
sure the relative value of 
these factors, pummeled 
by a whirlwind of sec­
ondary considerations––
family 
relationships, 
emotional 
and 
legal 
liability, an obligation 
to respect their friend’s 
wishes––while 
trying 
not to dwell on the knowledge that the decision 
they make could impact their friend’s long term 
physical or mental health? 
These decisions––they’re often not only 
upsetting, but incredibly perilous. A first-year 
undergrad with a semester of Biology 101 and 
access to WebMD is not able to properly triage 
a patient. A CDC report on binge drinking from 
2015 found that 113 people between the ages 
of 15 and 24 die of alcohol poisoning every year, 
though the number that die of alcohol-induced 
injuries and accidents is much higher (approxi­
mately fifteen hundred college students per year, 
according to the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism).
SECTION 7
It only takes one mistake—that 
decision to put a friend in bed 
instead of picking up the phone—
to cost someone their life. Every 
moment of hesitation, weighing 
unknown probabilities and 
balancing the possibility of physical 
cost against the guarantee of 
financial cost, raises that likelihood.

An ambulance speeds along South Frontage Road.
Josie Steuer Ingall was making a turn on her bike at the inter-
section of State and Bradley when she was hit by a car. Josie 
went flying and dislocated her hip. Some people eating nearby 
at September in Bangkok witnessed what happened and called 
an ambulance. Josie had heard stories before, and was not 
keen to pay any ambulance bills. She put her own hip back in 
place. “Do not put me in your white van. I am not going to the 
hospital,” Josie remembers thinking. But she was scared; she’d 
just been hit by a car after all. So when the paramedics from 
American Medical Response arrived on scene, they managed to 
persuade her to get into the ambulance for a quick assessment, 
so long as the vehicle didn’t move an inch. “I told them ten 
thousand times I don’t want to go to the hospital,” Josie said. 
The paramedics asked her a few questions, diagnosed her with 
hip contusions, and allowed her to hobble to her boyfriend’s 
house. Josie thought she’d managed to avoid the charge. Later, 
she got a bill for $500.
