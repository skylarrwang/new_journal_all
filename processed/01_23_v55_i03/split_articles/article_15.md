Coin-Gate: Who Stole
 Yale’s Doubloon?
Seventy years ago, five burglars stole nearly one million dollars worth of coins
from the Yale Numismatics collection. We still don’t know who they were.

Snapshot
on the night of May 
29th, 1965, five masked 
men broke into Sterling 
Memorial Library. The 
thieves hid among the 
stacks of old books 
before overtaking the night guards and 
breaking into the basement vaults. That 
night, they would carry out four thou­
sand looted coins, weighing about sixty 
pounds, from the Yale Numismatics col­
lection—one of the most decorated and 
valuable coin collections in the world. 
Among their loot, they took Yale’s famed 
Brasher Doubloon, the first gold coin 
produced in the United States follow­
ing independence. Altogether, the stolen 
artifacts totaled a value of almost one 
million dollars at the time—the largest 
robbery New Haven had ever seen. The 
case remains unsolved.

“The theft was carried out with 
expert selectivity,” explained James Tanis, 
the University Librarian at the time, in a 
June 7, 1965, Yale University News Bureau 
press release. “Only a limited number 
of the stolen coins are unique and read­
ily identifiable . . . In some instances, the 
thieves selected from individual trays 
only those coins combining high value 
and potential for undetected sale.”

Only a discerning eye can identify 
details that make coins more valuable, 
like their metallic composition and 
historic origin—the thieves had that 
eye. The press release also noted that 
the heist relied upon the “deactiva­
tion of burglar alarms and knowledge 
of the details of the safe keeping of 
the collection,” both well-kept secrets 
of the University Library. The thieves 
knew what they were looking for, and 
they knew how to get it.

Complete records of the coins in 
Yale’s numismatics collection were never 
made, largely because of the inconsis­
tent means used to acquire them. Yale’s 
collection was obtained through various 
donations and gifts made by life-long 
collectors affiliated with the University, 
growing to more than one hundred 
thousand coins over two hundred years. 
By the time of the heist, only those 
who routinely handled the collection or 
assisted with its curation knew its spe­
cific contents. The collection’s long-time 
curator, Theodore V. Buttrey, was one of 
the only people with the memory and 
experience required to be able to recount 
the collection. Just before the heist, how­
ever, Buttrey left his curatorial position 
to become a professor of Greek and 
Latin at the University of Michigan.

Following the break-in, Sterling 
Library administrators called Buttrey 
back to New Haven to identify the miss­
ing coins and provide an estimate of their 
cumulative value. The previously men­
tioned University press release also out­
lined these missing objects; the first page, 
titled “pieces easily identifiable,” con­
tained the descriptions of only seventeen 
coins. To the untrained eye, the rest of 
the list read as disorganized and incom­
prehensible. To numismatists, however, 
attuned to the differences in composi­
tion and origin of the stolen coins, pat­
terns appeared immediately—almost all 
of the collection’s American and English 
gold coins, for example, were stolen.

The absence of one particular 
coin was conspicuous: Yale’s Brasher 
Doubloon. A 1981 New York Times arti­
cle described Brasher Doubloons as 
“known among coin collectors as well as a 
Rembrandt among art lovers.” Ephraim 
Brasher, a New York goldsmith, forged 
only seven of these valuable gold coins 
in 1787. Brasher’s doubloons were made 
in the pre-federal period, before the 
establishment of the Philadelphia mint. 
Prior to the federal production of money, 
different types of metals were used to 
form the same coins, creating disparities 
in what should have been consistent val­
ues. Brasher would assay the coin’s actual 
value by measuring its weight in gold 
to ensure a standardized value. Upon 
completion, he would stamp the coins 
with his hallmark ‘EB.’ In addition to the
