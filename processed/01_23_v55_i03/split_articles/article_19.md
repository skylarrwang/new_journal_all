n the stands of Yale’s Reese 
Stadium, four drummers pounded 
out a roiling beat. Their heads bobbed 
in telepathic communion as the rhythm 
rolled through a crowd of over three  
thousand people.
It was August of 2017, and fans had 
gathered for the championship game of 
the semi-pro National Premier Soccer 
League, or NPSL. The final was a show­
down between Texas’s Midland Odessa 
F.C. and the Elm City Express—New 
Haven’s fledgling team, which had 
remarkably risen to the league champi­
onship in its inaugural year.
The game’s first goal came when 
Tavoy “Bull” Morgan, Elm City’s fleet-
footed top scorer, twisted past three 
defenders to slot the ball into the corner 
of the net. Minutes later, Morgan scored 
again: a mid-air volley with his right 
foot, which blasted the ball to an impos­
sible space just between the crossbar and 
the keeper’s outstretched fingers. In cel­
ebration, the Bull rammed a defender to 
the ground and sprinted to the stands 
with his hands cupped behind his 
ears to hear the fan commotion. More 
goals followed—the final score: 5–0,
Elm City Express.
The 2017 NPSL championship marked 
a high in New Haven sports. Over the 
past century, the city has seen a hockey 
team, a baseball team, and another soc­
cer team come and go. And by 2019, Elm 
City had disbanded too, leaving New 
Haven, once again, without a profes­
sional sports team.
But during that 2017 season, a 
new team and an eager fan base briefly 
alchemized into something unstoppa­
ble. “We started in the cold of February, 
and we ended up winning it by August,” 
remembers former right winger Sha-
quille Saunchez over a phone call last 
December. “It’s a journey that probably 
we will never forget.”


A
n online search for Elm City 
Express leads you five thousand 
miles south to the Brazilian state of 
Santa Catarina. The team was owned by 
the company K2 Soccer North America 
and its affiliate K2 Soccer South America, 
which also oversees a Brazilian soccer 
club. Both companies operate under 
the Brazilian-based investment out­
fit Baltoro Group. The reason why K2 
Soccer landed in New Haven remains 
somewhat unknown—but when the 
company arrived, they found a rich his­
tory of soccer in the city. 
Josh Nelkin was an Elm City fan 
and is a former player for the New York 
Ukrainians, an amateur soccer club. He 
remembers growing up in New Haven 
in the eighties and nineties among a 
vibrant and welcoming pickup soc­
cer scene, rooted in the city’s European, 
Latin American, and African immigrant 
communities. Nelkin had always wished 
for a Connecticut soccer team. “A New 
Haven-based team seemed like a far, far, 
dream,” he tells me over the phone. 
Nelkin’s dream became reality when 
Elm City arrived in 2017. The team built 
a roster based on local talent: in addition 
to a few loan players from K2 Soccer’s 
Brazilian club, management recruited 
heavily among soccer alumni from Post 
University, University of Connecticut, 
Quinnipiac University, Sacred Heart Uni-
versity, and other Connecticut schools.
“[Elm City] were the unifiers, all 
barriers were broken,” Nelkin remembers. 
Matches drew in die-hard soccer heads 
and people new to the game, young kids 
who dreamed of one day playing under 
an Elm City jersey and older fans Nelkin 
recognized from his pickup days, fans 
from a variety of cultural backgrounds. 
Even local Arsenal and Liverpool sup­
porters quelled their rivalry to unite 
behind Elm City.

Some of the team’s most loyal fans 
included participants of Elm City 
Internationals, a New Haven organi­
zation that offers academic and soccer 
programming to low-income youth, 
especially immigrants and refugees. 
Lauren Mednick, the organization’s 
founder, remembers her students col­
lecting autographs and kicking the 
ball around with players after matches. 
Outside of games, a few Elm City 
players tutored and coached students 
during their summer academy. Mednick 
would take students to practically every 
match, even traveling out of state so 
kids wouldn’t miss a chance to see their 
favorite players. “It was really something 
that they looked forward to, especially 
our youngest kids at the time. They 
really idolized the players and got to 
know the players,” Mednick says, and 
even over our crackly phone call, I can 
hear the smile in her voice. 
Head coach Ted Haley remembers 
that the number of fans grew steadily 
with each game. “It was kind of like 
the new restaurant that people start to 
rave about,” Haley says. “We were lucky 
enough to catch fire.”
According to Haley, the team also 
had supporters’ groups, or fan clubs, 
including a group with a New Haven 
pizza theme. “My kids still sing the 
songs that they were singing,” he adds.


T
he pizza song, I discovered, was 
to the tune of “Seven Nation Army.” 
Its composers were members of an Elm 
City supporters’ group known as the 
Brick Oven Brigade. 
I meet Ed Foley, one of the Brigade’s 
founding members, at The Cannon, 
a soccer bar on Dwight Street. The 
Cannon is styled like an English pub 
and home to the New Haven Gooners, 
a local fan base of the English Premier 
League team Arsenal F.C. Behind the bar, 
amidst a red collage of Arsenal memora­
bilia, hangs a blue Elm City scarf.
Foley, who is trim with a well-kept 
goatee, is a regular at The Cannon and 
a long-time member of the Gooners.

He spins stories expertly, never pausing 
or backtracking, and his speech is pep­
pered with references to mythology and 
ancient history I have to look up after we 
talk. There’s a palpable excitement in his 
voice as he recalls stories about Elm City. 
Foley describes Elm City’s 2017 sea­
son as “the halcyon days,” and the games 
as the “the greatest open mic night in 
all of New Haven.” He and his friends 
would sit behind the goal and poke fun 
at the opposition’s keeper—giving them 
nicknames or calling them by celebrity 
look-alikes. He remembers once yell­
ing at the opposing team as they lined 
up for a defensive corner kick until a 
defender stopped, turned around, and 
started laughing. “It was—how would 
I put it . . . not a hostile atmosphere, but 
an imposing atmosphere of just we’re 
gonna laugh at you for like ninety min­
utes and offer you a beer afterwards,” 
Foley says.
The Brigade was born when Foley 
bought a $3.50 Italian flag emblazoned 
with the word “PIZZA” off of Amazon. 
But he objects when I refer to him as a 
founder of Brick Oven Brigade. “It really 
wasn’t anything that formal,” he says, “we 
were just local dummies.”
While Foley has scrubbed Brick 
Oven Brigade socials off the internet, 
the now-inactive Facebook of a different 
supporters’ group lingers as a snapshot of 
that exciting time in Elm City Express 
history: The Yard Dogs, named after 
guard dogs that roam rail yards to pro­
tect trains. Their posts are just as aggres­
sive as the group’s name suggests, tearing 
into their Connecticut rivals, especially 
Hartford F.C., and reveling in Elm City’s 
dizzying rise.


F
or that 2017 season, Elm City 
Express had no brakes. They rolled 
through the regular season with a 9–2–1 
record. In the postseason, they glided 
past their first four opponents, scoring 
eleven total goals and conceding only 
one. Suddenly, the team had reached the 
league championship.
In the YouTube recap of the finals, 
after Elm City wins, players and fans 
melt onto the field in a screaming, 
jumping mass. Fans shake blue and 
white scarves while the silver cup gleams 
overhead. Mednick remembers play­
ers hoisting one of her students up on 
their shoulders in the middle of the field. 
In the back, you can see Foley waving
the PIZZA flag.
“It was like the epitome of local team 
wins,” says Foley. He went to Christy’s, a 
soccer pub at the time, and partied with 
players after the game. “It was just a real 
good night. One of those feelings that 
you only really get with a semi-profes­
sional team.”


L
oose summer nights stiffened into a
Northeastern autumn, and Elm City
entered the off-season. When the team 
returned in 2018, Nelkin, Haley, Foley, 
and the players I talked to said the 
urgency and energy of the first season 
had dissipated. 
First, Elm City lost their home turf. 
When Reese Stadium underwent reno­
vations in 2018, the team moved to Jess 
Dow Field at Southern Connecticut 
State University. Dow Field was twice as 
large as Reese and less centrally located. 
The roster changed, too. According 
to goalkeeper Matt Jones, nearly all 
players worked separate jobs to supple­
ment their income, making it difficult 
to keep players longterm. In the back­
ground, rumors floated about conflict 
with the Brazilian management and a 
lack of enough funding to carry on past 
the 2018 season.
With fans dispersed among Jess 
Dow’s bleachers, the games lost their 
original intimacy.


he official announcement that 
Elm City would not participate in 
the 2019 season appeared on the team’s 
Instagram in January. It remains the last 
post on the account.
There’s no epic trainwreck to mark 
the end of Elm City Express: just a 
scattering of gently rusted remains. As 
I collected bits of the team’s story, I 
wandered through abandoned social 
media accounts, old YouTube clips, 
and 
corporate 
websites 
translated 
from Portuguese; I learned about the 
pickup soccer games that used to rule 
Yale fields and heard strange stories of 
hundreds of Elm City scarves sponta­
neously appearing at the local Savers. 
Slowly, an image began to emerge—one 
of a team so intimate, so tangible for 
fans that, for one summer, it became 
transcendent.
In one telling, the story of Elm City 
Express ends in a surprising tragedy: a 
source of joy for New Haveners vanish­
ing with no satisfying explanation. In a 
different version, Elm City’s demise was 
inevitable. The very things that made 
the team special—its smallness, local­
ness, its concentrated fanbase—made it 
difficult to pull in a wide group of casual 
viewers, creating a model too insular to 
survive long-term.
What I can say for sure, is that New 
Haven had a soccer team. A good one, 
too. They created something special 
at Reese stadium. But they’re not here 
anymore, and the craving for the energy, 
connection, and purpose Elm City gen­
erated for its fans remains. Nearly every 
fan I talked to expressed a hope that 
someday Elm City, or a local team like 
it, could return to the city.
