Students say the cost of an ambulance is preventing them from
seeking necessary emergency care. Is Yale paying attention?

Will Caraccio ’25 was getting ready for 
bed one night in October, 2022, when 
he got a text that his friend and for­
mer roommate, Kyle Hovannesian ’25, 
was drunk. Really drunk.

The news was alarming, but not totally sur­
prising. Will and Kyle had been roommates 
throughout their first year. Halloween night was 
the first time Kyle needed an ambulance. Will 
came home around one in the morning to find 
vomit all over the room, a third of a handle of 
vodka gone, and Kyle, nearly unresponsive, unable 
to walk by himself––all the warning signs of a 
potential overdose he was taught to look for in 
Yale’s safety training. “The first time I saw it, I was 
terrified. I was like, this kid is going to die,” Will 
said. “It’s kind of traumatizing.”

That night, Will followed protocol. He 
called 911, listened for sirens, and talked with the 
paramedics as they loaded Kyle into the back 
of the ambulance. Will passed it off as a typi­
cal “Welcome to Yale” moment, a rite of passage 
nearly all college first years experience. But the 
situation repeated itself; once, and then again. 
Will kept calling for help, listening for the ambu­
lance to pull up outside the gates of Old Campus, 
watching the paramedics wheel his friend out
on a gurney.

As harrowing as the ambulance trips and 
overnight hospitalizations may have been for 
Kyle, both he and Will remember the problems 
really starting after Kyle left the hospital. Kyle 
would get a bill from the ambulance company 
that promised to suck up all the money he’d been 
saving up from his student job at––of all places––
Yale Health. It meant signing up for more shifts 
at work, calculating how much credit he could 
afford to spend, and cutting down on expenses, 
just to afford the following semester’s tuition. “I’m 
thinking, ‘there goes my entire savings,’” Kyle 
said. “[It] kind of starts a chain reaction that takes 
over my life.” Eventually, Kyle learned calling an 
ambulance was virtually out of the question.

“His life could be in jeopardy, or at least his 
health could be in jeopardy, whether or not it kills 
him. But at the same time he’s begging me, plead­
ing with me not to call,” Will said. “So I don’t 
know what to do. I genuinely think if I were to 
call the ambulance every time . . . he would have 
dropped out.”

So when Will got that text in October of 
2022, he knew the drill. It turned out a scared 
friend who worried for Kyle’s safety had already 
called 911, and an ambulance was on the way. Will 
sprang into action. “What I did essentially was to 
say, ‘I know you don’t want to go in the ambulance. 
You need to put on a really good performance for 
me,’” he said.

Will led Kyle to bed and turned off the lights. 
When the paramedics showed up, he lied and 
told them Kyle was fine; he was in bed, sleeping 
it off. When they demanded to see him anyway, 
Will told them to wait. He crept into the room 
and tried to prepare Kyle as best he could. He 
knew that the paramedics would ask Kyle some 
questions; he’d seen it enough times before to 
get the gist: Where are you? How old are you? How 
much money is seven quarters? Kyle, for his part, 
was terrified. He wouldn’t remember anything 
from that night, except this encounter with the 
paramedics. He knew if he failed to convince 
them he was okay, they would make him go to 
the hospital, and he’d get slammed with another 
bill. “I was telling myself, ‘O.K., sit up straight, 
speak slow, clear, annunciate’ . . . It was very high 
pressure,” Kyle said. Both played their part well. 
With Will’s help, and the calming influence of 
the darkened room, they managed to persuade 
the paramedics to leave.


Representatives at Yale Health and the Yale 
Dean’s Office have told me they haven’t heard that 
ambulance bills present an obstacle to seeking 
medical attention, or have claimed outright that 
they do not. But students appear to disagree. Over 
the last six months, I spoke with twenty-one cur­
rent and recently-graduated Yale students about 
experiences in which they personally hesitated 
to call for an ambulance, or witnessed someone 
hesitating to call one. Some of them had taken 
an ambulance trip at Yale already, and preferred 
to risk their health rather than experience it again. 
Others had heard what it would cost them or 
their friends, and figured it was safer to handle 
the situation on their 
own. These students 
spoke of other concerns 
that contributed to their 
hesitation, but one fac­
tor was far and away the 
most common and sig­
nificant: the bill.

“I remember my 
friend was really drunk 
and really sick and was 
being wheeled out to 
the people that came 
with the stretchers,” said K. “And she was asking 
me, ‘Am I going to have to pay for this?’...That’s 
not something that you should be thinking about 
if you’re in that state.” 

The dilemma of whether to call an ambulance 
during a true emergency, these students told me, is 
a threat to students’ mental and physical well-be­
ing, as well as their financial security. Many of 
these students claim that Yale has not meaning­
fully addressed or acknowledged the issue, leading 
them to doubt whether the University is uphold­
ing its fundamental responsibility to ensure the 
safety of its students.
