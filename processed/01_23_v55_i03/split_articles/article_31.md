O
ne of the best tattoos Sam 
Jannetty has recently made was 
for a fellow lesbian. It was two 
black-and-white scissors, well, scissoring. 
Like she does with all her designs, Sam 
posted this tattoo to her Instagram page, 
sprinkling rainbow emojis in the caption: 
“IYKYK.” (If you know, you know.)
 Sam is the owner of Broken Crystal 
Tattoo Studio in Milford, Connecticut, 
which she advertises as a queer-friendly 
tattoo shop. The descriptor is unnecessary. “I mean, we’ve got frickin’ Rick and 
Morty playing in here,” Sam says, gestur­
ing to a large flat-screen TV hanging on a 
robin-egg blue wall. The rest of the shop 
resembles an explosion of a Pride parade. 
There are rainbows everywhere: a rain­
bow fan, splayed open next to a poster 
with a chicken nugget on it that reads 
“NUGS, NOT DRUGS”; a rainbow tapestry 
depicting UFOs abducting people from 
Earth; and rainbow Pokemon figurines 
filling a plastic bowl on the coffee table as 
if they were front desk mints. On my first 
visit, I had no trouble finding the shop in 
an otherwise nondescript suburban strip 
mall, as Sam had also hung a set of sheer 
rainbow curtains on the front window. 
Sunlight streamed through, casting kalei­
doscopic reflections on the tiled floor.
It’s in this rainbow-tinted sunlight 
that I watch Sam show me her own 
tattoos. “I think I have, like, thirty-five?” 
She pauses, squinting in the brightness 
as she counts. “Yeah, I’d say thirty-five 
tattoos.” With her colorful arm tattoos 
and neon hair that she dyes and re-dyes 
on a whim, Sam settles in her store per­
fectly. “I wouldn’t worry about putting 
that too close to me,” she says, making a 
slight shooing motion when I adjust my 
phone to record our conversation. “I’m 
loud as hell.”
Sam doesn’t quite have sleeves—or 
at least not yet, she tells me—but her 
tattoos nearly envelop her forearms. She 
raises her arms, wrists turned upward, 
to give me a better look. There’s a red 
Pac-Man, a matching tattoo she shares 
with her siblings, next to a large moth 
that wraps its wings protectively over her 
right elbow. She also has an ice cream 
cone with a skull on top of it, a happy 
little alien holding on to a happy little 
cat, and a tiny fish tank (because she 
has a tiny tank—a small bladder—her­
self). Many of her tattoos were drawn by 
other artists whom she lets practice on 
her own skin. There’s no coherent theme 
tying all of these designs together, but 
I’m surprised to hear that she thinks a lot 
of these permanent creations suck. “This 
one here,” Sam says, pointing to a very 
gay, very rainbow gradient bar on her 
upper arm, “when the artist started, and I 
saw the ink bleeding together, I thought, 
‘Oh, shit.’” She shrugs and laughs.
Sam runs Broken Crystal (she chose 
the name because it’s rather “pastel goth,” 
she says) with her sister Chloe and 
another colleague. The shop opened in 
April 2021 and has drawn a loyal, mostly 
queer cohort of tattoo enthusiasts. Sam 
started tattooing around her college 
graduation, five years ago. In that time, 
she’s seen her fair share of the less savory 
side of the tattooing industry. She got 
her tattooing license by enrolling in a 
tattooing school, ignoring the traditional 
route of becoming an apprentice to a 
more established artist. But Sam found 
the school, with its exorbitant tuition 
and a general lack of committed instruc­
tors, to be highly exploitative. Sam pri­
marily taught herself by practicing, for 
hours upon hours, on fake skin and 
fruit rinds, and eventually joined a tat­
too shop in New Haven as a new artist. 
But the shop she worked at was a far cry 
from the one she owns now. Most of the 
other artists were men, who would occa­
sionally hit on their women clients. Sam, 
a “hundred-footer” (someone you could 
spot as gay from a hundred feet away), 
immediately felt out of place. “I was the 
show pony of the shop,” she says.
Sam hates being told what to do, and 
her anti-authoritarian impulses blos­
somed as she grew tired of traditional, 
male-dominated tattoo shops and their 
hypermasculine decor. After saving up 
some money, she left the old shop and 
opened her own studio. “They’re all 
the same,” Sam says. “You walk in, and 
there’s a motorcycle up front. There’s 
some creepy-ass version of metal music 
in the background, all these guys around. 
It’s like a sit down, shut up, get tattooed 
kind of thing.”
At her old shop, Sam had to endure 
some rather bizarre tattoo requests. Once, 
a gay man walked in and demanded that 
she tattoo the f-slur on the inside of 
his lip. He wanted to reclaim the word, 
and a queer artist should help him do it 
at the very least, right? Another time, a 
couple—it’s always the couple tattoos—
wanted each other’s names tattooed on 
them in a brushstroke heart with three 
money wads on one side, three pot leaves 
on the other. No matter what, Sam 
reserves most of her judgment, with the 
exception of turning down one customer 
who insisted on getting a butterfly tramp 
stamp that started in her ass crack.
“Sometimes I’m like, you really want 
to get this shit on you right now?” she 
says. She lets out a brief sigh. “But if you 
want it, you want it. Go for it.”
I 
decided to get my first tattoo a 
couple summers ago, when I began 
dating women for the first time. It was 
a simple line drawing of two koi fish 
swimming around each other, designed 
by my childhood best friend, who is also 
queer and Chinese. I knew I wanted it 
on my arm, or somewhere visible on 
my body. I wasn’t going to hide it under 
a sleeve, or keep it tucked behind my 
ear. My body and I have had a strained 
relationship, and it became even more 
tense during lockdown. I had little to 
do besides waste time in my childhood 
bedroom, watching my body and face 
mutate and metamorphose: gaining 
weight, losing weight, gaining it back, 
plus more; cutting my bangs, dying my 
hair. I became less interested in looking 
thin, pretty, and appealing to men—the 
things I’d been concerned about before 
the pandemic cut my sophomore year of 
college short—and more concerned with 
just looking different. Having a visible 
tattoo was a part of that journey.
Sometimes, I look through the CVS 
photos that used to hang under the 
string lights in my dorm. The photos 
remind me of how little I recognize in 
my old self. In one photo, she’s wearing 
a hot pink dress, her arms draped around 
a friend. She’s drunk, but laughing. In
