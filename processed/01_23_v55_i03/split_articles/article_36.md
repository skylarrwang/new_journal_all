New Haven Board of Alders. The vote 
that took place on November 10th, 2022, 
was swift and unanimous: the corner 
of Orange and Elm was declared to be 
Lucretia’s Corner. For Winter and Dr. 
Robinson, the ease of this process reaffirmed 
the ability of the public to elevate past lives 
and stories. Lucretia’s life, Winter noted, “was 
long overdue” for remembrance.


In the days after the vote, Winter 
and Dr. Robinson celebrated the naming 
of Lucretia’s Corner, the same location 
where Lucretia worked on Governor Eaton’s 
three thousand-acre, thirty-person estate 
four hundred years ago. “[Corner naming] is a 
great tradition because it acknowledges that 
the public has control over the public space and 
what stories are told in the public space,” Winter 
said.


When Dr. Robinson stumbled upon 
Lucretia’s name nearly twenty-five 
years ago, she had no idea who Lucretia 
was and sought to put a face to the name, 
to answer the lingering question of Who is 
she? As she continued to search throughout 
the archives across New Haven 
and the larger part of Connecticut, Dr. 
Robinson came to draw up only fragments 
of Lucretia’s life, compiling only a short 
stack of documents that failed to reveal 
who Lucretia was.


There’s very little on Lucretia beyond 
her name, the touchstone to Lucretia’s 
life which first prompted Dr. Robinson’s 
search. She blames part of this absence 
on the great fire of 1666, the remnants 
of which caused Eaton to rebuild his 
estate from wood to brick and stone. Dr. 
Robinson questions what couldn’t have 
been replaced—that perhaps lost to 
the fire were irretrievable hints to who 
Lucretia was.


“Lucretia’s case is interesting because 
she is one of the few named enslaved 
people,” Dr. Robinson told me. “Names 
weren’t common, especially when you were 
thought of as property.” Yet even in her 
name there is uncertainty—we don’t know 
if Lucretia really was her name, whether 
it was a title she was born with or one 
that she was consigned to bear. Perhaps 
it was just something that Eaton tacked 
on when she arrived to the Americas. As 
I raised these doubts to Dr. Robinson, she 
looked at me and could only nod her head 
in agreement.


“It’s like a puzzle,” Dr. Robinson says. 
“You have to piece together what you’ve 
heard, what the literature tells you.” It 
seems that in between the gaps of the 
pieces is silence, and in the silence is where 
you will find Lucretia.


The city has decided it is Lucretia’s 
Corner now, the corner of Orange and 
Elm. Perhaps this gesture is meant to signal 
her final ownership of the two acres that 
Eaton once allotted her. But then again, 
you wouldn’t know that this is her corner. 
There still is no plaque commemorating 
her place. Instead, you will find the words 
“ROSA STOP HATE” scratched into a 
concrete wall. Just above it, a torn poster 
peeling away from its tape: Slow Down. 
Breathe, the poster echoes—stop and think, 
appreciate the life that has been placed 
before you, remember her life. But we do 
not know exactly what that life entailed.


Can it ever be Lucretia’s corner? She 
is not here—not physically at least—to 
claim ownership over it, and a corner is not 
enough to undo the violence that she faced 
and the erasure that subsequently left her 
absent from history. A name is practically 
all that is left, and that too is riddled 
with doubt. During our conversation, Dr. 
Robinson says, “We don’t know where in 
Africa Lucretia was born. We don’t know 
where she’s buried.” A corner doesn’t tell 
us these things.


I don’t think the corner is enough, but 
I don’t think the corner was ever meant 
to be the solution. It’s an act that brings 
Lucretia, slowly, into the public memory of 
current-day New Haven, rather than leaving 
her to be forgotten, spared just a few 
words in the archives.


“The corner naming is something that 
I hope can bring together so many people 
from various walks of life,” Dr. Robinson 
tells me at the end of our conversation. “At 
the corner of Orange and Elm you have 
the government buildings, the rich and 
powerful, and even housing projects all in 
the same ward; that ward is a place that 
represents the Green, the public library, 
and, in a small space, all of New Haven.”


We don’t know what her real name 
is—we can’t ever know. Yet what we do 
know is this: four hundred years ago she 
once existed, and four hundred years later 
she continues to live. To remember her 
is to reignite that flame, to believe in her 
life beyond our grasp—that we don’t need 
to see her nor find her to believe that she 
lived. So it isn’t much, but it is something, 
a piece that brings remembrance. This is 
her corner. ∎

In all of her work, she 
reaches back into 
the past, cultivating 
counternarratives 
for the lives that were 
reduced to single lines 
within historical 
records. These stories, 
entangled with her 
own, beat out a steady 
drum: “We cannot 
be forgotten,” Dr. 
Robinson insists.
