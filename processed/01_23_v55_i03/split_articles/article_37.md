**Diamond Cave**
**Author: rachel shin**
**Page number(s): 50-51**

This collection is inspired by the poem
“금강 굴” / “Diamond Cave” by Ko Un.
The poem, translated by Sunny Jung, goes:
What a relief
you cannot live everywhere all at once.
Today, here in Diamond Cave,
there’s no longer any reason to live.
Stay one or two days:
this world
& the Other are drained of difference.
Wind blows.
As a pearl is born at seabottom in agony
out of oyster flesh from within the most obscure darkness
here the wind blows from the depths.
I want to travel far & then return.
The wind blows as if I were eighty-five,
maybe eighty-seven.

The Diamond Cave is at once dislocated 
and omnipresent—both current and 
timeless. The location is, for each reader, 
“Today, here.” At first blush, Ko’s take
on the present is nihilistic as he writes that 
life is devoid of meaning and difference. 
However, in the second stanza, change stirs.
Wind blows and a pearl tears from the 
womb. As Ko earlier equated difference with 
meaning, we see that these infinitesimal
motions create purpose within “the most 
obscure darkness.” In Korean, the word “굴,”
 which Jung translates as “Cave” in the
title, also means oyster. Thus, Ko likens the
imperceptible seabottom affairs of the oyster 
to our “Today, here.” He suggests that even 
within the most obscure darknesses
of our individual Diamond Caves, pearls 
may yet be born.
Here, I sought to capture pearls—beads of 
luminescence—in various Diamond Caves 
through which I’ve passed.
