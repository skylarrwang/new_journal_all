EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
My first impression upon meet­
ing William Harold is that he 
has absolutely destroyed the 
piano in front of him. He’s trustworthy, 
of course, because he is a piano tech­
nician, but at the current moment the 
Steinway grand that he sits in front of 
looks genuinely wrecked. He’s taken 
it apart in ways I didn’t realize a piano 
could be taken apart. The keys, for exam­
ple, and the entire action (the mech­
anism which translates a press of a key 
into a hammer strike) have been slid for­
ward, out of the piano frame, and onto 
his lap.


Harold has been Yale School of 
Music’s resident piano technician since 
1997, which means that he is responsi­
ble for maintaining the 130 Steinways 
(high-quality pianos built by Steinway 
& Sons) on the University’s property. 
He tries to stay invisible, but perhaps 
you’ve still heard him making his rounds 
between 8:30 and 5:00 every weekday, 
traveling between concert halls, practice 
rooms, and studios on campus. Each 
session takes him about an hour and a 
half, which means he tunes around four 
or five pianos every single day. Harold’s 
job requires more than simply tuning 
each piano, though. As I interrupt his 
session in Woolsey Hall, he’s adjust­
ing what’s called a “backcheck”, a small 
block that catches the hammer so that 
it doesn’t bounce too far away from the 
string, allowing a pianist to repeat a note 
very quickly.


Harold grew up not far from 
New Haven in the town of Guilford, 
Connecticut, 
and 
studied 
physics 
at Hampshire College in Amherst, 
Massachusetts for two years. He had no 
formal piano training before college, but 
he started teaching himself to play on 
a friend’s keyboard, “to distract myself 
from all the physics.” At first, he taught 
himself by ear, improvising blues and 
jazz-inspired tunes, which he wordlessly 
describes by turning to the piano in front 
of him. “At Hampshire, my sound was 
all—” he improvises for a few minutes, 
leaning deep into the keys to churn out 
bluesy licks and progressions, reminisc­
ing on the soulful sounds that first drew 
him to the instrument.


“Physics and music—you’re learn­
ing all about wave forms, and about 
how sound waves interact with each 
other . . . that was the perfect thing to be 
studying to do this because in the end, 
this is a mechanical acoustical phenom­
enon,” he explains. After graduating 
from Hampshire with degrees in both 
Physics and Music, he began working at 
the Sohmer Piano Factory in Ivoryton, 
Connecticut, much to his parents’ cha­
grin (“You go to college to get out of the 
factory!”). Forty years later, he’s still in 
love with his craft. He employs his phys­
ics degree as he describes the tuning pro­
cess, explaining, “If you have two notes 
that are in perfect tune, then the crest 
and the troughs and wavelengths are all 
coherent. The waves are the exact same 
frequency and each crest is matching up 
with each crest.”


Harold bends down to sift through 
his bag of tools, reaching for an oddly 
shaped wrench and two small rubber 
wedges. Although I myself am a pianist, 
the inner mechanism of the instru­
ment is still largely a mystery to me, so 
Harold invites me to peer into the piano 
with him as he launches into a patient 
demonstration of his process. Using the 
wrench, he starts to turn a tuning pin––a 
small knob that, when twisted, tightens 
or loosens a string in the piano, raising 
or lowering the pitch it produces. Each 
note is produced by three separate strings 
that are hit simultaneously by one ham­
mer, so he must make sure that they’re 
all completely in tune with each other, 
and in equal temperament with the rest 
of the piano. He pounds the key as he 
tunes, moving his hand with the sound 
waves being produced by the two strings. 
He’s revealed something I wouldn’t have 
picked up on before—a beat within the 
sound, a wavering that lines up with the 
pulsing motion he’s making with his 
hand. He has a finely honed ability to 
hear that discordance, when the sound 
waves are “out of cycle,” as well as a tuner 
app on his phone, and he uses both to 
wiggle the tuning pin into its rightful 
place. After a few adjustments, the note 
rings out clearly.


“Sometimes, over the years, just like 
anything else you do forever, there are 
some days where I’m just like, ‘what am 
I doing? I’m tuning a piano—what’s 
a piano?’” Harold admits to brief mo-
ments of existential crisis about a job
where he is “just tightening and loos­
ening strings all day,” but immediately 
thereafter he adds, with a hint of disbe­
lief at his own good fortune, that “I’ve 
been doing this for a long time, and it’s 
still cool to me, isn’t that weird? I was 
lucky, you know?”


Harold has a riveting disposition. 
You can tell that he doesn’t often get the 
chance to talk about himself, and now 
that he has someone’s full attention, he 
barrels forward and answers questions 
without even needing to be asked. In a 
drawling voice, he speeds through phys­
ics-heavy explanations, graciously check­
ing for comprehension every few minutes.


“You got that?” he asks, making eye 
contact.


“Uh-huh,” I say, nodding along, “and 
how––”


I don’t get my question in, but it’s 
O.K., because he’s started talking about 
something far more interesting.


“The ultimate goal is to make myself 
as invisible as I can, and the best way to 
do that is to do my job.” He tunes pianos 
before rehearsals and performances, long 
before anyone else has arrived. He tries 
to finish fifteen minutes before he’s sup­
posed to, as it makes everyone nervous 
to see him doing last-minute touch-
ups on the piano. Today, we’re sitting at 
the Steinway that lives in Woolsey Hall, 
Yale’s largest and most opulent recital 
hall, in preparation for a concert in the 
afternoon. This is already the third time 
this week that he’s tuned this specific 
piano, which seems both tedious and 
excessive, but he insists it is important 
for the success of tonight’s performance.


“Well, you know, if something [goes] 
wrong I can always blame you, right?” he 
chuckles.


“Sure,” I offer. I’m definitely distract­
ing him.


“No. I can’t. I can’t blame anybody, 
it’s my responsibility to get this thing 
done. I can’t blame anybody else,” he says
with finality.


While he defends that it’s his 
responsibility to make sure the piano is 
in working order, he admits that he used 
to be tempted to make excuses for flaws 
in tuning jobs, likening this to inexperi­
enced musicians who are quick to blame 
their instrument for flaws in their perfor­
mance. He won’t give me any names, but 
he recounts a story of an accomplished 
pianist who was rehearsing in Woolsey 
Hall a few years back and complained 
about the piano action. Harold took a 
look inside the piano, even though he 
had just spent two days perfecting every­
thing within it. It was flawless.


“I see what the problem is, but I need 
a half an hour,” he told them. When the 
pianist returned from a walk twenty-five 
minutes later, Harold was pretending 
to finish up by twisting a tiny screw in 
the action (which he had simply rotated 
back and forth a few times). He set the 
piano up exactly the way it was half an 
hour earlier. The pianist re-attempted 
their piece, and Harold received a rous­
ing round of thank yous for whatever 
miracle he had performed.


In this way and in countless others, 
Harold has been the unsung hero of 
hundreds of concerts held at Yale over 
the past twenty-five years. He’s set to 
retire at the end of this year, and he has 
a surprising plan for his well-earned 
free time.


“I’ve been taking [piano] lessons,” he 
says, “and I practice two or three hours 
a day when I come home, so I’ll have 
something to do.”


He closes our interview by playing 
a full piece on the freshly-tuned piano, 
one he’s been working on with his piano 
teacher that’s been giving him a little 
bit of trouble. It’s a tango by Alberto 
Ginastera, and it sounds lovely. It’s not 
nearly the most difficult piece that’s 
been played on this stage, but William 
Harold plays with a remarkable amount 
of sensitivity. He’s spent the past forty 
years getting to know this instrument, 
inside and out, and now he’s finally get­
ting a chance to play. ∎
