into the (connecticut) woods
B
efore we crossed the gate into Hamden’s West 
Rock Ridge State Park, Michael Richardson pulled 
a bottle of mosquito repellent from a backpack stuffed 
with hiking supplies. “I have two separate infections 
of Lyme disease, so I make a point of bringing the 
bug spray every time I come out,” he explained to me 
as we stood near the park’s entrance. “It’s just one of 
those things you have to deal with, I guess.” 

Richardson knows nature, ticks and otherwise: 
he has spent the past four years compiling a compre-
hensive guide to native species 
of plants and animals across the 
state. In 2010, the 37-year-old 
Connecticut native founded 
the educational website Con-
necticutWilderness.com; today, 
the website features nearly 900 
creatures, from Sphyrapicus 
varius, the yellow-bellied sap-
sucker, to Notophthalmus viri-
descens, the Eastern newt.

Even on this sunny Saturday 
morning in September, when 
people in hiking boots and ca-
noes dot the sunlit Connecticut landscape, Richardson 
said his thoughts often turn toward darker visions. 
“Every time I’m out, I’m always sort of thinking from 
a survivalist standpoint,” he said as we headed down 
the trail. “You have to think about it in terms of what 
would happen if there was a zombie apocalypse or a 
nuclear bomb went off.” 

Richardson knows this eschatological vision—
the undead swarming the parking lot, the woman on 
the red canoe paddling through hellfire—is improb-
able. Unlike so-called “doomsday preppers” obsessed 
with the apocalypse, Richardson is ruled by a more 
practical motivation: he’s simply fascinated by how 
nature abounds with resources for survival. His ex-
treme thought experiment—and the attention to de-
tail it requires—has afforded him a near-encyclopedic 
knowledge of the Connecticut species he now cata-
logs online. The man behind ConnecticutWilderness.
com is part Bear Grylls, part botany teacher—and de-
termined to get his visitors to rethink their relation-
ship with nature.

Richardson discovered his love for the wilder-
ness as a teenager, tucked away at summer camp in 
the New Hampshire woods. There, from the camp’s 
counselors, he learned about vegetables that came 
from the ground, not the gro-
cery store: wild plants that you 
could pluck straight from the 
dirt and eat. The first he tried 
was a slender white root called 
Indian cucumber. With just 
one bite, he was hooked. “I 
knew you could pick blackber-
ries and blueberries and all that 
stuff, but the Indian cucum-
ber, that was cool,” Richard-
son said. Later that summer, he 
decided to draft an exhaustive 
map of the campground’s ed-
ible plants, a feat for which he won Camp Pasquaney’s 
nature award. “That was sort of the first iteration of 
Connecticut Wilderness,” he said.

He built the current version of the website about 
four years ago to share his knowledge. By day he is 
an IT professional, and the project has offered him an 
opportunity to learn additional computing languages 
and skills. Richardson uses everything from vinyl re-
cords of birdcalls to Wikipedia to guide his work. 
“The best way to get proficient is to spend a lot of 
time studying,” he said. “You have to be really careful 
and know what you’re looking for.” To illustrate his 
point, Richardson motioned me over to a cluster of 
black and yellow insects, buzzing menacingly around 
a clump of purple blooms.

“Come down low on these guys,” he said, squatting 
down with his camera. He let one of the fuzzy critters 
climb his finger. “That’s a syrphid fly,” he said. “They 
look like bees. They’re mimics.” But unlike bees, 
they’re harmless. Syrphid flies’ resemblance to a more 
dangerous doppelganger helps them ward off preda-
tors—plus freak out inexperienced hikers like me. 
But those familiar with the wilderness, my guide 
included, have an easier time than predators at rec-
ognizing the many mimics that live in Connecticut. 
Richardson cites another common local example: two 
plants, mountain laurel and wintergreen. The former 
is poisonous, while the latter lends a minty taste to 
chewing gum. But both have red stems and blue-
green leaves. When we found a plant that fit that de-
scription, Richardson used a pocketknife to slice off 
a portion, then plucked off its leaves, tore them in 
half, and gave the fragments a sniff. Pressing the leaf 
fragments to his mouth, he took a taste to confirm his  
identification: wintergreen.

Richardson rarely checks the analytics that would 
tell him how many people have visited his website. 
Just 51 Facebook users, including myself, “like” the 
website’s fan page. Still, it’s important to him that the 
website expand, both online and off. He hopes to 
develop a mobile version of his site, and he recently 
hosted a mycology walk under the ConnecticutWil-
derness.com banner attended by a dozen people eager 
to learn to identify wild mushrooms. 

In Connecticut, a state better known for its coun-
try clubs than its national parks, the challenge isn’t 
taming the wilderness, but finding it. Here, foraging 
for wild edibles is a hobby, not a matter of sustenance. 
“You’re never really going to be anywhere in Con-
necticut where you can’t get rescued,” Richardson 
said. “Even in the deepest of forests, you really can’t 
get more than five to ten miles away from a road at 
the most.” But even a short distance from the pristine 
lawns of suburbia, he can point at nearly any plant and 
tell you whether you can eat it.

On our hike, Richardson identified dozens of 
other species that can sustain hungry foragers, from 
sheep sorrel, a lemony herb that goes well in salad, 
to common mullein, a fuzzy-leaved plant that grows 
close to the ground and is said to have medicinal ef-
fects. Some plants have multiple uses, too: take mul-
lein, for example. “Its best use is as toilet paper in the 
woods,” Richardson said. “It works.” While you may 
never find yourself wiping with a leaf, the point has 
been made: there’s an abundance of treasures in the 
forest, if only you learn to find them.

T
he quest for the Holy Grail. The legend of the 
Sword and the Stone. The founding of the Knights 
of the Round Table. These, and other tales, fill the il-
lustrated pages of Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. 
Malory, an English knight and Member of Parliament, 
wrote the book while imprisoned in the 1470s. Since 
then, the book has become one of the most well 
known collections of the heroic deeds and chivalric 
romances of King Arthur’s reign.

Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library 
owns a special 1838 edition of Le Morte d’Arthur—
one of just three hundred ever created. Its handmade 
paper is fragile. Its edges are torn, interrupting the 
patterns of pears and leaves that line the pages’ bor-
ders. Some pages have come loose from the binding. 
The book creaks as I flip through its pages. But even 
in this condition, the book is valued at over $10,000.

Yet, until very recently, it sat in the shelves of the 
open circulation stacks of Sterling Memorial Library, 
available for anyone to check out. The book finally

THE NEW JOURNAL

found its way to the Beinecke in September when ju-
nior Katie Stoops checked it out, for pleasure reading. 
One of the book’s first pages says that it is “of su-
perior issue.” Intrigued, Stoops 
researched the book’s history. 
She learned that the Dutch pa-
per the book was printed on 
makes it extraordinarily valu-
able. To make the paper, fine 
linens were steeped in water 
and dried between different 
coatings of salts, liquors, and 
acids of fermented rye or but-termilk. The linens were dried 
and re-wetted for weeks un-
til they were white and sturdy 
enough for printing. 
When she discovered the 
book’s value—a UK book-
shop lists the volume on Abe-
Books, an online book mar-
ketplace, for $11,711.10—she felt uncomfortable 
being in possession of a book with such “historical 
and monetary” value. After contacting Sterling Me-
morial Library, Stoops gave the book to Brian Kiss, 
who works in the circulation department there. 
Kiss quickly brought Le Morte D’Arthur to the Bei-
necke through the basement tunnel that connects the  
two libraries.

Stoops’s story is unusual, 
but not unheard of at Yale. About 
once a month, someone dis-
covers a rare or very old book, 
potentially worth more than a 
thousand dollars, in the Ster-
ling collection. It is then moved 
over to the Beinecke. Though 
old and fragile books still turn 
up occasionally, Kiss said that 
it’s uncommon for books as 
rare—and as valuable—as Le 
Morte d’Arthur to be found in the stacks, available  
for circulation.  

In the past eleven years, Yale’s libraries have made 
an effort to move all rare and fragile books to the 
Beinecke. The library’s staffers combed through the 
Sterling stacks in 2004 as part of a major project to 
move thousands of books into their collection. Sarah 
Schmidt, head of printed acquisitions at the Beinecke, 
said they were looking for everything published be-
fore 1800. At any given time, four staff members 
and two students were assigned to the project. They 
methodically went through 
the library catalogue, finding 
the call numbers of rare books 
and collecting them from the 
stacks. George Miles, a curator 
of Western Americana at the 
Beinecke, says that he knows 
the project didn’t find all of the 
rare books, but “we felt pretty 
confident that we got most of 
them.”

In 2006, the former Cross 
Campus Library was renovated 
to become today’s Bass Library. 
During the construction, its 
books took up temporary resi-
dence in Sterling. Kiss helped 
re-shelve Sterling’s books to 
make room for the Cross Campus collection. It was, 
he says, “the first time in a long time that people had 
put their hands on literally every single book in the 
entire library.” While moving the books back to the 
newly opened Bass in 2007, Beinecke staffers were in-
structed to put aside any book printed before 1800 so 
that these books could be moved to the Beinecke col-
lection. “They found tons and tons of stuff,” Kiss says. 
Many of the books were small, 
pages numbered with Roman 
numerals. Most were not writ-
ten in English. Hundreds were 
transferred to the Beinecke. 
Kiss explains that books 
printed in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries circulat-
ing in Sterling were not part 
of the project. The scope of the 
transfer was already so large 
that including newer books in 
the search would have added an enormous amount of 
work for the librarians. That may be one reason that 
the Dutch paper edition of Le Morte d’Arthur, which 
was printed after 1800, remained in the stacks.

But books are moved to the Beinecke for reasons 
other than old age. Some are very fragile—for exam-
ple, historical political pamphlets and booklets. Oth-
ers might be particularly difficult to replace. Even so, if 
ABOUT ONCE A 
MONTH, SOMEONE 
DISCOVERS A RARE 
OR VERY OLD BOOK, 
POTENTIALLY WORTH 
MORE THAN A 
THOUSAND DOLLARS, 
IN THE STERLING 
COLLECTION. 

the Beinecke already has a copy of a rare book—even 
if it is worth a significant sum of money—multiple 
copies are allowed to stay in Sterling so that library 
patrons can access them. This could be a second reason 
why Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur was overlooked 
in Sterling: the Beinecke already held two older copies of 
Malory’s book when Stoops discovered the 1838 edition. 
However, because of its Dutch paper, this 1838 edition was 
even more valuable than its counterparts in Beinecke. 
Only by flipping through its pages could someone real-
ize its significance. 

So, some rare books still linger in Sterling. While Yale’s 
librarians want to make its collection of over fifteen mil-
lion volumes available for research, they also want to en-
sure that the books are properly preserved. Though books

in the Beinecke collection are not in open stacks, students 
and researchers can read them in the reading rooms. 
“The library system at large is looking to balance secu-
rity with accessibility,” Miles says. “It’s one of the hardest 
questions that libraries face. They want to serve today’s 
readers as well as tomorrow’s.” As a result, books like the 
illustrated Dutch-paper Le Morte d’Arthur may continue 
to wind up on the desks of students who are unaware of  
their value.

“I would imagine,” Miles says, “that there will al-
ways be a few books in Sterling that we are surprised 
to discover are still there.”


**Title: haunted haven**
**Author: Libbie Katsev**

“P
oint five’s nothing. In New Haven, we  
get sevens.”

Chrystyne McGrath stands outside of the Star-
bucks at the intersection of Chapel and High Streets, 
surrounded by a crowd of about forty people. She 
holds up a black box the size of a graphing calculator. 
It’s an EMF meter, a scientific instrument that mea-
sures changes in electromagnetic fields. A small screen 
displays a single number. If the number is at least 0.5, 
McGrath says, then the machine might be detecting 
a ghost.

The EMF meter is one of a ghost hunter’s primary 
tools, but McGrath is less of a hunter and more of a 
guide. On this cold Friday night in early November, 
she’s leading us on a ghost tour of New Haven. Mc-
Grath is wearing a silver down coat and a hat with a 
leopard-print band. By day, she works at the Health 
Options Center for Wellness in Guilford, which of-
fers a smorgasbord of alternative medicine options in-
cluding herbal treatments and hypnotherapy. By night, 
she leads tours for the New Haven division of Ghost 
Walks USA, which also offers tours in New York City, 
Washington, D.C., and Palm Beach, Florida. 

Before we get started, McGrath gives us a crash 
course in ghost physics. When we die, there’s a light. 
If our spirits go into the light, they pass on; if not, 
they stay here and haunt the living, hovering one foot 
above the ground and feeding the local ghost tour-
ism industry. In a symbiotic relationship, the tourism 
industry feeds the ghosts. Ghosts consume electricity, 
according to McGrath, which is why EMF meters can 
detect them. She warns us our phones are likely to go 
dead, but to keep them ready anyway: Ghosts can be 
captured on camera as glowing orbs or bright streaks 
of light. Often, orbs appear in the photos the morning 
after – charging your cell phone overnight feeds the 
spirits, who then decide to grace your pictures with 
their presence.

McGrath asks if anyone has experienced a ghost 
before. Most people stay silent, but one man in a black 
jacket raises his hand. Later, he’ll volunteer to knock 
on the door of the Skull and Bones tomb, the first stop 
on tonight’s tour. 

We stop at about a dozen places, including secret

society tombs, Sterling Memorial Library, the Grove 
Street Cemetery, Yale’s visitor center, and City Hall. On 
the way, we get a good dose of New Haven history, ev-
erything from the Amistad up-
rising to Hurricane Sandy. This 
history is full of ghosts. Some 
are historical figures like Cor-
nelius Vanderbilt, and others 
are prominent local legends. 
Mary Hart, better known 
as Midnight Mary, haunts Ev-
ergreen Cemetery, near the 
intersection of Columbus Av-
enue and Ella T. Grasso Boule-
vard. The tour doesn’t stop at 
Evergreen Cemetery, but Mc-
Grath tells the story anyway: 
According to legend, Mid-
night Mary was buried alive. 
And then there are the name-
less spirits, like the murdered girl with long red 
hair who haunts the basement of the New Haven  
Free Public Library.

At Sterling Memorial Library, McGrath shares two 
stories. The first is of a kindly librarian named Auntie, 
who still helps students out with their studies, de-
spite having died decades ago. 

The second is about an entity 
that called itself “Seth.” Back in 
1963, a poet named Jane Rob-
erts was possessed by this spirit. 
While channeling Seth, Roberts 
went on to write many books, 
known as the Seth Material. The 
manuscripts and letters, along 
with some recordings of Jane 
Roberts, ended up in the Ster-
ling Memorial Library’s Manu-
scripts and Archives collection, 
taking up a total of 498 boxes. 

After that, we spend some 
time huddling in front of the 
gates of the Grove Street Cem-
etery. There, the ghosts of soldiers killed in the Revo-
lutionary War greet McGrath, she says. McGrath tells 
us to take pictures, and if our intentions are strong, 
the ghosts will show up for us, too. I guess I’m not 
sincere enough, because I don’t get any orbs, just a 
glowing white blotch in between the bars of the gate. 
It might just be my camera flash reflecting off another 
participant’s cellphone, but I can’t be sure. I do feel 
a cold patch as we walk along the gates of the ceme-
tery—I mean, the entire East Coast is a cold patch, but 
it seems to me that the left side 
of my body is a little bit chillier 
than the right.

The Union Trust Building 
on Church Street now houses 
Wells Fargo. But, almost a cen-
tury ago, a nasty bank teller 
named Eli Wilson skimmed 
money off of other people’s 
savings. He died in accident, 
trapped in the bank’s airtight 
vault. Later, phantoms of laugh-
ing children terrorized the 
men who tried to paint the 
walls. That’s a sure sign that the 
building was once an orphan-
age, McGrath says. Following 
her instructions, I put the EMF 
meter that McGrath had lent to me on the ground 
to see if it will pick up signs of any ghosts. Some of 
the tour’s participants had downloaded an app that al-
lowed their phones to act as EMF meters, so they put 
their phones on the sidewalk.

I had been carrying the EMF meter for much of 
the tour, and it had been fluctuating wildly through-
out the walk. I’m surprised that it doesn’t beep in 
front of the Union Trust Building, even when I lay it 
on the sidewalk. But it goes wild when we’re crossing 
the street. I wonder if it’s a fluke, or if it’s picking up 
the spirit of an unfortunate pedestrian. 

As we head over to the New Haven Green, a man 
on the tour approaches McGrath. He’s got a photo 
with an orb in the window of one of the city hall 
buildings. Can she tell if it’s the real thing? This is it, 
I think: confirmation of the supernatural, or at least 
of…orbs. McGrath looks at the picture. She says it 
looks like a light fixture.

We stop in the middle 
of the New Haven Green and 
stand by a plaque that marks 
the ground in front of a sap-
ling. It replaces the old Lincoln 
Oak that came down during 
Hurricane Sandy, skeletons and 
a time capsule tangled in its 
roots.

“The vortex is right here,” 
McGrath says. A vortex is a 
place where energy is concen-
trated, and McGrath said later 
that all high-energy locations—
including burial grounds like 
the New Haven Green—have 
a vortex. McGrath explains that 
the people burying the time 
capsule a century ago had found the vortex using 
dowsing rods, divination tools that pick up electro-
magnetic signals. (Today, there’s an app for that.) She 
invites us to step onto the vortex, and one at a time, 
people do. One woman feels a tingling in her hands. A 
man starts to rock back and forth, slowly.  I’m swaying 
too, where I’m standing, and I know it’s because it’s 
late and I’m tired and naturally unsteady on my feet, 
and I wonder if they’re swaying for the same reason, 
but I don’t take a turn on the vortex hotspot. Maybe 
I’d rather not find out.

“H
ow can the nation expect that the Republicans 
will solve the problem of the president not 
being able to drive the nation’s bus properly when 
they’re the ones who punctured the tires?” The voice 
coming from the stereo on the back of Reverend Ray 
Dubuque’s van lilts and breaks on “tires”—it sounds 
wise; a little paternal. Dubuque drives in circles, down 
College Street, right on Chapel, up High, and back 
around again. “That’s my voice you’re hearing,” he 
says. “I just recorded it this morning and burned it 
onto a CD. I’d use a mic, but I’m not sure how to rig 
it up in here.” 

So here he is, this friendly, red-sweatered man in 
his mid-seventies, driving the car that I’ve been trying 
to track down for weeks. You’ve probably seen him—
his tan sedan and trailer are now part of the afternoon 
landscape of downtown New Haven, looping around 
the Yale campus on clear weekday afternoons, blar-
ing Frank Sinatra and slow jams, plastered in slogans 
for websites called “LiberalsLikeChrist” and “Great-
Liberal-Insights.” In the past, Dubuque was a Catholic 
priest, then a Methodist minister; now, he is retired. 
He has run these websites since the late 1990s. The 
ones advertised on the van are the main sites, but a 
bit of clicking on large, grainy gray buttons will lead 
you to over 400 html pages—“JesusWouldBeFurious,” 
“theGodlessConservativeParty,” 
“ColumbusNoHero,” 
“MorePartisanshipPlease,” and “CatholicArrogance,” 
to name a few. Some of the pages are meticulously 
researched exposés on conservative corruption, some 
are detailed analyses of scripture, and some are plain 
rants. Full of blinking buttons and big, blue hyperlinks, 
with most of the text resting on a background motif 
of computer-generated linen, they seem to be a relic 
of the Web’s frontier days in the late nineties, bold but 
unsophisticated. Dubuque says all his pages serve a 
common goal: “I want liberals in America to wake up. 
Seventy percent of Americans identify as Christians. 
Instead of treating them as rivals, we should aggres-
sively persuade them to support the party that sup-
ports the ideas of Jesus Christ”—by which he means, 
of course, the Democrats.

www.liberalslikechrist.org/thegodlessconserva-
tiveparty.html: “Christian conservatives” have 
been using guilt by association for dec- 
ades to suggest that “liberal Christians” of [sic] 
being godless Marxists. Where is the evidence 
to support that charge?

Dubuque pulls over onto Hillhouse Avenue and 
waits for an opportunity to turn around. Some stu-
dents walk by as we wait for a green light. They look 
at the car for a few seconds, a little amused, then  
keep moving.

“Anyway,” Dubuque continues, following them 
with his eyes, “I’ve been wanting to advertise for 
years. I watch television all the time—MSNBC, and 
sometimes I go over to Fox to see what they’re up 
to—and I see that they’re spending millions of dollars 
on commercials. I don’t have that kind of money. So 
I bought this caravan this summer and hitched it to 
my car.”

I ask him why he wants to get the word out. Is 
there a Liberals Like Christ community? He tells me 
he has a Yahoo group moderated by one of his friends. 
It has just over five hundred members, and averages 
a few hundred posts per month. The forums are used 
for discussion, but Dubuque never tries to organize 
in-person events. “Organizing liberals is like herd-
ing cats,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of chiefs, but  
no Indians.” 

But never mind the organizing—Dubuque has a 
lot to say. The sun is setting as we round Chapel Street 
again, and the pink horizon illuminates one side of 
his face through the windshield. For a second he has 
the stoic and collected look of a world-weary vision-
ary. “You’re probably wondering what my definition 
of ‘liberal’ is,” he says slowly. “Now, by my definition, 
Stalin and Lenin were conservatives. Conservatives 
aren’t about conserving the past—that’s a huge mis-
take. They’re about conserving power for themselves. 
Us liberals, we’re about distributing wealth and power. 
We’re about equality.”

As he rattles off the hot-button issues, he says his 
websites give Christian liberals fodder for argument. 
On taxing the rich, according to Dubuque’s page 
“ChristvsChurch,” Jesus is pretty clear: “Anyone who 
wishes to be first in the kingdom of god should make 
himself the last and the servant of the rest” (Matthew 
20:26-28). Jesus doesn’t even mention homosexuality, 
or abortion, says Dubuque. “Of course, people on the 
Christian right will say, ‘But the Bible says, ‘Thou shalt 
not kill!’” Dubuque laughs a little. “And what’s that 
supposed to mean? The Bible doesn’t say thou shalt 
not kill a fetus anymore than it says thou shalt not kill 
a mosquito.” 

I ask him if he’s trying to use the sites to convert 
conservative Christians. “Those who really are conser-
vative have a lot to lose. I don’t expect to convert the 
Koch brothers. But the other ninety-nine percent, the 
non-wealthy conservative Christians, are just being 
lied to. If they really believe in the teachings of Jesus, 
hopefully I can convince them.” I ask him if he’s ever 
had any meaningful discourse with members of the 
Christian right. “Not really,” he admits. But he doesn’t 

I ASK HIM IF HE’S EVER 
HAD ANY MEANINGFUL 
DISCOURSE WITH MEMBERS 
OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT.

IN THAT GROUP.”

Can hypnotherapy help Yale’s athletes master their minds—and their opponents?

Story and illustrations by Ivy Sanders-Schneider 

T
he Yale men’s soccer team won only one of its 
seventeen games this season. Midway through 
the fall, physical training had not led to considerable 
improvement on the field. The coaches hoped to find 
another way to give their team an edge. They talked 
one-on-one with the players, learning what made 
each man tick; they even administered personality 
tests. They were not looking for information about 
the players’ observable performances. They were in-
terested in improving the team’s mental game. De-spite months of training, they psyched themselves out 
on the field. So the coaches offered a few players an 
unusual opportunity: hypnotherapy.

Ryan Simpson, a sophomore athlete, was one of 
three teammates who took the coaches up on their of-
fer, and the only one to agree to an interview. The tall, 
bright blond goalie had dated one of my suitemates, 
so he was especially candid with me. On the soccer 
field, Ryan often struggled to keep his mind under 
control. He was jittery and nervous. He reacted slow-
ly, and didn’t jump high enough or dive far enough 
to make saves. Off the field, he kept his frustrations 
bottled up until they began to manifest in insomnia, 
anxiety, or the cathartic breaking of furniture. Despite 
these problems, he didn’t initially embrace the idea  
of hypnotherapy. 

“I went in thinking, ‘This is going to be silly,’’’ 
Ryan said. He agreed to hypnotherapy partly out of 
a sense of obligation: the hypnotherapist, Leanne 
Peterson, is also the fiancé of the team’s assistant 
coach, Hiro Suzuki. (Suzuki and Brian Tompkins, the 
recently retired head coach, could not be reached  
for comment.) 

“I never thought it would work,” Ryan continued, 
“but I am so happy to say I was one hundred percent 
wrong…It helped me attempt to figure out me.” 

I wanted to believe Ryan when he talked about 
the radical change in his perspective, so Ryan and Pe-
terson allowed me to come along to their second ap-
pointment. So I suppressed my doubts and went to 
experience hypnosis for myself. 

Hypnosis has long been a pop-
ular as an on-stage entertain-
ment stunt. As a result, hypno-
therapy has struggled to assert 
itself as medically sound. It can 
be hard to find unbiased infor-
mation about the effectiveness 
of the practice, since most of 
the testimonies are from prac-
ticing hypnotherapists. The few 
scientific studies that do exist look into two dozen 
participants at most. For example, a 2000 study pub-
lished in the academic journal Perceptual and Motor 
Skills observed that “hypnosis may positively control 
emotions, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions,” but 
the two researchers, sports psychologists at the Uni-
versity of Sheffield Hallam, based their claim on the 
experiences of a single “elite senior European tour 
golfer.” Other studies, which look at hypnotherapy pa-
tients’ cerebral blood flow or athletic performance, are  
similarly questionable.


The many hypnotherapy services, however, 
promise success rates that science cannot. There are 
over a dozen such centers in the greater New Haven 
area, many of which practice sports hypnotherapy 
and count Yale athletes among their clients. One is the 
Amadeus Center for Health & Healing, which is lo-
cated just two blocks from the university’s campus. 
Mindful Warriors, based out of Lakeville, Connecti-
cut, offers testimonials on its website from Yale varsity 
golfers as well as volleyball, football, and field hockey 
players, all praising the therapist’s ability to help them 
relax and learn about themselves. So, the soccer team’s 
embrace of hypnotherapy isn’t entirely new.


The NCAA publication Mind, Body, and Sport, 
calls sports psychologists “an ideal resource to pro-
vide care and services,” but warns against “motiva-
tional gurus” and “mental coaches,” who can find 
“college athletics a prime target for their services, 
and they may very well ignore, minimize or neglect 
the real issues of psychological health.” Still, Matthew 
Stults-Kolehmainen, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist 
and researcher at the Yale Stress Center and Columbia 
University told me that he believes the therapy might 
have some merit. Though he wouldn’t personally 
prescribe hypnotherapy, “the literature does report 
some evidence of efficacy for 
some performance-related out-
comes,” he said. 


Hypnotherapy’s reputation 
often affects clients’ expecta-
tions. Peterson, the hypnother-
apist, noted that clients often 
come in either overly skepti-
cal, which prevents them from 
feeling any effects, or overly 
excited, believing her to be a 
psychic. 


A licensed clinical social 
worker, Peterson practiced traditional talk therapy for 
two years before acquiring her hypnotherapy license 
in 2013. With hypnotherapy, however, she says she 
sees results much more quickly. In her experience, 
the treatment can address issues as varied as academic 
underachievement, grief, and depression in only four 
sessions. One patient’s anxiety seemed to decrease by 
half after just one meeting. As Peterson put it, she’d 
“never seen results like that in traditional therapy.”


When Ryan and I met to walk to our hypnotherapy 
session, I expected him to guide us to a clinic or office 
building. Instead, we turned toward a nearby apart-
ment building. Peterson has a New Haven office for 
her business, meditation, yoga, and therapy center 
called Elevate, but she sometimes holds informal ses-
sions at home.


A small woman with shining brown hair, Peter-
son was poised and professional. She asked us to re-
move our shoes in the entryway before guiding us 
to the living room, lit warmly with star-shaped lan-
terns. There, Ryan and I each lay on a wing of her  
L-shaped couch. 


Our session, like each session Peterson adminis-
ters, began with a conversation about what hypno-
therapy is and what we wanted to address. Peterson 
played a mellow instrumental track on her laptop, as 
she turned down the lights and began to speak slowly 
and softly.

“Imagine a ball of energy starting at your toes,” 
she began. We envisioned it rolling from our toes 
to our feet, up our legs and throughout our bodies. 
“Imagine your body melting away,” she continued, 
and we systematically let the consciousness of our 
limbs float away, arm, arm, leg, leg. 

Worried I wasn’t fully experiencing the hypnosis, 
I analyzed my experience as it occurred. What would 
happen, I wondered, if I moved my arm? Would it 
break the spell? But even as I considered it my limbs 
felt heavy, locked in place, as if asleep. I could move 
my arm, I thought. But why bother? This was the 
hypnosis, I decided—or, at least, the manifestation of 
my desire not to sabotage my own experience. Later, 
I asked Peterson why, instead of losing consciousness 
completely, I felt half-awake throughout the session—
aware of my body and my senses but unable or un-
willing to move. She reassured me that my experience 
was a common one, explaining that people tend to 
expect hypnosis to feel utterly new, when in reality 
it is more like an extended state of relaxation, similar  
to meditation. 

Continuing the hypnotherapy, Peterson instructed 
us to mentally walk down a staircase to a meadow. 
From there, she told us to walk along an outdoor 
path, following the sun. In my mind I followed the 
sun along a California hillside, which transformed 
into a tree-lined trail as my thoughts increasingly gov-
erned by dream logic.  

“Follow the path and don’t worry about your fu-
ture,” Peterson directed us. “The future is your path 
and the sun will guide you.” From the path we were 
directed to a movie theater, where we were instructed 
to watch ourselves succeeding on the screen. In my 
black-and-white mental movie, I was taking tests, 
writing papers, completely calm throughout.  

“Picture yourself during finals succeeding. Say to 
yourself, ‘I am enough. I am enough,’” she instructed. 
“Say, ‘I am relaxed and peaceful. I release stress.’” 

We hovered there for a moment, watching our 
imaginary futures on our imaginary screens, before 
Peterson walked us backwards out of the hypnosis: 
we traveled down the path again, up the stairs, and 
then, on a count of three, became aware of our bodies 
and our faces, and finally opened our eyes. Ryan woke 
as if from a deep sleep, unable to remember half of  
the session.


Although an inch-long tear in his quadriceps pre-
vented Ryan from completing the soccer season, he 
did play one post-hypnotherapy game on his injured 
leg. It was the Harvard-Yale soccer game. Normally 
antsy and unfocused, Ryan remembers feeling calm 
and relaxed. During the game, instead of letting his 
doubts get the better of him, he told me he was able 
to trust himself. The mental shift translated into bet-
ter performance. He made smarter decisions and felt 
more confident, which helped him block more shots.


It’s impossible to know how much of this can 
be attributed to the hypnotherapy, but Ryan credits 
the treatment for his improvements. He recalled how, 
during his first session, Peterson asked him to visual-
ize two abstract struggles: first, climbing a mountain 
until he reached what he described as “his vision of 
success”; and then plunging “underwater and feeling 
crushed by the weight of everything,” until he swam 
to the surface. Ryan said hypnotherapy allowed him 
to switch his perspective from a glass half empty to a 
glass half full.


Yet, Ryan had wanted to be calmer and more pres-
ent, so hypnotherapy may have acted as a catalyst for 
a mental shift he had already been reaching towards. 
Changes he attributed to hypnotherapy might have 
occurred simply through force of will. Maybe even 
the opportunity to pause and reflect improved his 
play. “The purpose [of hypnotherapy]  is to remind 
you of what makes you succeed and what causes you 
to fail,” Ryan said. 


I had seen Ryan’s transformation, and I wanted 
hypnotherapy to work for me. A few days later, I found 
myself in the library quietly chanting, “I am enough. 
I am enough.” But it was hard, during the academic 
crush of early December, to know if the calmness I 
was feeling was a result of a subconscious suggestion 
or a sign of emotional burnout. I think I’ve been bet-
ter able to deal with stress, but I don’t know if it’s pos-
sible to say that hypnotherapy changed me. It might 
have simply been, as Ryan kept suggesting, a reminder 
to pay more attention to myself.


Who knows—maybe the secret to athletic suc-
cess is not daily workouts, lifting weights, or run-
ning drills. Maybe the secret is lying in a darkened 
room, conjuring up mental mirages, your limbs  
perfectly still.

I’m in Mumbai when Samantha dies, and Siem 
Reap when I find out. I see it on Facebook, which 
is how I always learn that an acquaintance has died. 
It’s 5:00 a.m., and my circadian rhythms are upside 
down. The air beyond my hotel room window is 
warm and soggy, and it’s fogging up the glass. The 
air-conditioning on my face feels like it would be 
chlorine-blue if I could see it. The room smells like 
perfume and bleach fumes. I’ve promised myself that 
I won’t use my laptop first thing in the morning, but 
it’s my only connection with home and I wake up 
reaching for it.

The first thing I notice is that there are cryptic 
little notes sprinkled through my news feed.

Cassandra: Goodmorning @Sam. <3 <3 <3 Think-
ing of you this morning. I still don’t believe it.

The posts are all tagged like that: @Sam, her name 
lit up in a luminous blue. Second, I notice the jokes.

Jake: I swear you must have demanded them to 
bring chicken fries back when you got up there lmao 
I saw the commercial today and instantly thought 
“Damm Sam would flip shit!” Lmao miss you boo. 

Third, I notice the comments choking with  
earnestness.

Monte: i just don’t know what to say its just so un-
real that another one of my friends have left this 
earth. I’m gonna miss all the random times Sam 
would just show up at my house and just take me 
on one of her random adventures.Through thick 
and thin i always knew that she would be there. 
As she would always say to me “ i got your back 
kid” Truly an angel love you sammy. - @Sam

Fourth, I see photos, like a slideshow at a wake.

in a flurry like down feathers, or Cam pulling it out 
in tufts.
The second was Dante. He was tall, with an imp-
ish smile that showed gaps between all his teeth. He 
grew up in the Pleasant View Acres project. In fifth 
grade, Dante and I used to yell “Two Musketeers!” 
and then press our foreheads together until our brains 
hurt. In high school, Dante played football. He wore 
dark purple polos, and these spotless suede Timber-
lands that were so fly. He went to a state college, but 
he dropped out after a year, and then he dropped out 
of contact.

A rusty iron freight train rolls through Lewiston 
every twelve hours at a speed that seems too slow for a 
train. It blows a low, whale-sound whistle that used to 
re-play in my dreams when I was drowning. At 4:00 
a.m. one morning, Dante left 
his apartment, walked down-
town, and stood on the rail-
road tracks. He just stood there, 
watched the train come, heard 
the whistle, and stood there.

His brother got a stay of 
sentence for his misdemeanor 
conviction to attend his funeral.
Sam was the third to die. I 
knew her the least well of the 
three, but it was impossible not 
to like her. She was loud and 
friendly, always cursing brightly 
and dancing in the hallways. She had a semi-ironic 
obsession with Spongebob Squarepants, and she used 
to carry around pineapple-house erasers, wear starfish 
t-shirts, and burst randomly into the theme song in 
full-on pirate-accent.

I lost touch with Sam when I graduated, and she 
took an extra year to finish school. I saw her again 
the November before she died, three and a half years 
later. We were at the Blue Goose, a bar that’s small 
and damp and black like a hole in the earth. Sam was 
drunk. So was I. She had gained some weight. She had 
a little freckle on her chin that I had never noticed be-
fore. She wanted to hear about college. I told her that I 
was taking the year off to sing with the Whiffenpoofs. 
I’m always embarrassed to talk about Yale back home, 
so I added,“That’s pretty pretentious right?” She just 
called me “kid” in this affectionate way that I’ve only 
ever heard in Lewiston. She said, “Yeah, kid, but it 
sounds fun.” She had just enrolled in a local college. 
She wanted to be a teacher.

At 2:00 a.m. on July 27th, Sam was driving her 
family’s Ford Focus down Buxton Road, drunk and 
screaming-fast. She swerved off the road and hit a 
telephone pole. The Ford flipped and landed on the 
driver side. The metal scrunched, crushing her in her 
seat. They closed the road for two hours to fix the tele-
phone pole, and then opened it right back up again.

Life in Lewiston has an undertow of desperation. 
It’s the kind of small, poor town where everyone’s 
family settled there in the 1850s to work in the mills, 
and they’ve all been working the same kind of blue 
collar jobs ever since. The mills are closed now, so they 
work in the Tampax factory, or the Country Kitchen 
Donuts factory, or they don’t work at all. Kids call it 
the Armpit of Maine, or the Dirty Lew. They dream of 
leaving, throwing all of their belongings in a mud-
crusted Ram pickup and driving south-west forever, 
but they never do.

I didn’t feel desperation to leave, growing up. 
My parents moved to Lewiston in the ’90s to teach 
anthropology at a nearby liberal arts college. Lew-
iston was their chosen home, so that’s how it al-
ways felt for me. But as graduation drew closer, 
it became increasingly inevitable that I was going 
to leave (whether I wanted to or not), and that my 
friends were going to stay, stuck, like in a bad dream 
where you’re thrashing but something’s got you by  
the ankles.

Mourning brings people in Lewiston together 
like nothing I’ve ever seen, though minor league ice 
hockey runs a close second. Everyone in Lewiston re-
members being young and bored and trapped. They 
don’t just grieve for one person’s death; they grieve 
for the town, for the kind of place where kids die try-
ing to get out. It’s intense, public, ebullient grief. It’s 
the whole town in matching white shirts, releasing 
orange balloons strung with letters to the dead. These 
kids die praying to break free, but strangely, wonder-
fully, their deaths draw the community into an even 
tighter circle.

I mourn vicariously for Sam, through photos on 
Facebook. I see six tattoos of Sam’s name, surrounded 
by tropical flowers, on two left feet, one bare chest, 
one forearm, one shoulder, and one delicate shoulder 
blade. I see three rear windshield graphics reading In 
Loving Memory Samantha 1992-2014, with match-
ing decals of Spongebob Squarepants lying on his 
side, batting long, playful eyelashes like Sam’s. I see 
two pieces of Sam-inspired jewelry: one locket hold-
ing a little bit of a bumper sticker from Sam’s car, one 
bracelet with an inscription of Sam’s name. And I see 
one roadside shrine, by the telephone pole on Buxton 
Road where she died. Stuck in the ground is a make-
shift white cross, and above it float two Spongebob 
balloons. I find six pictures of the shrine, and when I 
put them in the right order, they make a time-lapse. 
The balloons drift slowly to the ground, and visitors 
pile the cross so high with bouquets that you can’t see 
it anymore.

The summer that Sam dies, I’m on a twenty-seven 
country world tour with the Whiffenpoofs. We travel 
to a new city every forty-eight hours, and it’s exhila-
rating and disorienting. In East Africa, I start pretend-
ing I’m sleeping in my own bed. In the Middle East, 
I turn to Google Maps, and stare at satellite images of 
my house. I watch Lewiston’s post-crash convulsions 
from Southeast Asia, plunged in the deepest pit of my 
homesickness. I want to be there. I want to do some-
thing for Sam—something big, like a tattoo, or a bou-
quet by the cross. Maybe it’s selfish, but I want to be 
a part of Lewiston’s special kind of grief-celebration.

But I left. I was never trapped in Lewiston, and 
now I’m gone. This distance has never been more 
pronounced than when I’m traveling the world with 
a Yale singing group, stuffing myself into tailcoats, 
pretending I knew that you were supposed to hold a 
champagne glass by the stem, or call it a “flute.” The 
departure has become too spectacular now, too gaudy. 
It cuts me off, disinherits me from the right to mourn 
for Sam and my hometown. What could I possibly say 
about Sam’s death? What do I know about her life?

I sit on my hotel bed in Cambodia, my face bath-
ing in the laptop’s blue light. The picture’s there, and 
there’s a freckle on her chin. I’m wondering if this is a 
silence that will lead me to slip away from home for-
ever. And I’m wondering if it would be too much—or 
not nearly enough—to break it, and click a few keys.

I’m sorry, @Sam
Or
@Sam, rest easy

water slide slicked with baby oil. Sherry posts one of 
Sam as she was just before she died: twenty-two years 
old, creamy skin, highlights in her hair, hoop ear-
rings, deep dimples, crooked laughing bottom teeth, 
wet-looking eyes.

Lewiston, Maine is spilling guts on the internet 
today, and I want to look away, but I can’t. Some of 
the most enthusiastic grievers barely knew Sam at all. 
There’s something inviting about this kind of exhibi-
tionist mourning. I’m halfway around the world, on 
tour with the Yale Whiffenpoofs, and all I want to do 
is take part, send something home, a few sad words, 
wrapped in a comment box. I want to write about how 
she died so young that now her death will be the big-
gest thing that ever happened to her. How it will seem 
like the whole point of her life 
but it wasn’t, it couldn’t have 
been. My fingers hover over 
the keys, jittery. I don’t write  
a word.

This is not the first time 
that one of my classmates has 
died in the few years since I 
graduated from Lewiston High 
School. Andrew was the first. He 
was a giant with a soft, round 
face. He lived in a run-down 
complex on Bartlett Street. He 
had a booming bass voice, and 
he used to cheer so loudly at football games that the 
coach would kick him off of school property. When 
he sang, you felt it rumble in your chest like your 
body was against a dryer. He wanted to be a singer. 
The last time I saw Andrew was at graduation. He 
wasn’t walking, but he cheered from the bleachers. 
After the fanfare, he walked up to me with puffy eyes, 
and this goofy swagger like he didn’t have a care in 
the world. He told me that he was going to take sum-
mer classes and graduate within a year. One more year 
wouldn’t be so bad.

During that year, Andrew overdosed on bath salts. 
The police said they couldn’t be sure, but we all knew 
it was bath salts. I couldn’t make it back for the funer-
al. A few weeks later, I went home and hung out with 
Cam, who was with Andrew the night he died. Cam 
was nineteen, and bald. I guess he had started losing 
his hair in high school, but I couldn’t help picturing 
it happening all at once during the funeral, falling out

A
t an evening Mass at Saint Mary’s Church on Hill-
house Avenue, Father Joseph Allen stands at the 
pulpit and reads to his congregation from the Gos-
pel of Matthew. He reads the story of a miracle: as 
Jesus departed from the city of Jericho, two blind 
men stopped him on the road. These men knew him 
and begged that he cure their blindness. Jesus asked 
them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” “Yes, Lord,” 
they responded. Jesus touched their eyelids. “Let it be 
done according to your faith,” he told them. The men 
opened their eyes and began to see.

Father Allen pauses to look around at the parish-
ioners in the pews of New Haven’s oldest Catholic 
church. He takes a deep breath. “These men are grasp-
ing for anything in their hope for a cure,” he says. 
“They are at a point where nothing in their society 
can help. And so, it is their faith that saves them.” 
He closes the Bible and carries it down the pul-
pit steps, back to the altar, where he continues to cel-
ebrate the Mass. After Communion, the service con-
cludes with a familiar prayer. Though the text is in 
every parishioner’s pew-box, no one reads from the 
paper: they know the words by heart. They pray to 
God for the canonization of Father Michael McGivney, 
the parish priest who, some 130 years ago, devoted 
his life to the widows, orphans, and indigents of this 
very church. 

Father McGivney’s spirit may dwell in heaven, but 
his body is in their midst. Father McGivney’s remains 
lie at the back of the church, in a granite sarcoph-
agus that glows under a row of lights. The congre-
gants pray for Father McGivney’s help in delivering 
miracles. They all speak the same prayer, but hope for 
different things: some pray for a cure for illness, oth-
ers for a job to pay the bills or a loved one to return  
safely home. 

“We pray that God will grant the favor through 
the intercession of Father McGivney on behalf of us,” 
says Father Allen, a Dominican friar who has been a 
pastor of Saint Mary’s Church since 2007. “And it is 
certainly a lot of prayers storming heaven. For three 
years now, we have said the prayer at the end of each 
Mass, every day, and many of the parishioners say the 
prayer on their own.”

At this point, Father McGivney’s Cause for Saint-
hood—the process by which someone becomes a saint 
in the Roman Catholic Church—has been advancing 
for seventeen years. But it is a long and complicated 
road to sainthood. Now, Father McGivney’s advocates 
need to show that he has helped make miracles hap-
pen by interceding with God on behalf of the faithful. 
Authentic miracles, it turns out, are hard to prove.

In the late 1800s, when Roman Catholics often 
endured prejudice in the largely Protestant Northeast, 
Father McGivney devoted himself to New Haven’s 
Catholic community. In his time as a priest at Saint 
Mary’s Church, from 1877 to 1884, he visited the 
sick, tended to the dead and dying, and helped those 
who could not help themselves. 

John Walshe, Father McGivney’s 
grandnephew and a practicing 
lawyer in Bridgeport, says that 
stories of Father McGivney’s self-
less work have been passed down 
through his family. 

“He wasn’t the type to stay 
inside the church all day, and he 
wasn’t all ‘sackcloth and ashes,’” 
says Walshe. “When one of his parishioners was in 
need, Father Mike”—as the family affectionately calls 
Father McGivney—“wasn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves 
and get his hands dirty.”

Father McGivney was particularly concerned with 
New Haven’s Probate Court. The Court routinely sep-
arated widowed mothers from their children if the 
mother was unable to demonstrate her ability to sup-
port each child. Father McGivney had seen this hap-
pen many times, and throughout his career, he inter-
vened to assist widowed mothers in danger of losing 
their children. Once, he vowed to serve as a guardian 
for a young man about to be sent to an orphanage. 
But he could neither attend to every such case 
nor change the system singlehandedly. So, in Octo-
ber 1881, Father McGivney gathered several of his 
parishioners in the basement of Saint Mary’s Church, 
where he was then an assistant pastor. He explained 
to them his vision for a new organization of Catholic 
laymen, one that would provide insurance for Cath-
olic families. In the event of the death of a family’s 
breadwinner, this insurance would give the remaining 
family members the financial support needed to stay 
 together. This, Father McGivney hoped, would put 
an end to painful separations at the ruling of the  
Probate Court.

On March 29, 1882, he founded the Knights of 
Columbus to provide insurance to Catholic families. 
Within twenty years, the group’s membership had 
swelled to over 10,000, and its mission had expanded 
beyond insurance to include charitable work. Today, 
more than 1.8 million men across the world belong 
to the organization. Over the last ten years, they have 
contributed a total of nearly 700 million hours of  
volunteer service.

The organization has remained devoted to Father 
McGivney and his founding principles of charity and 
altruism. In 1997 the Knights of Columbus Supreme 
Council, headquartered in New Haven, petitioned the 
Hartford Archdiocese to start the 
process of canonization for Father 
McGivney. They asked then-Arch-
bishop of Hartford Daniel Cronin 
to initiate the first stages of Father 
McGivney’s case. He named Fa-
ther McGivney a Servant of God, 
formally beginning the Cause  
for Sainthood.

Only three people born in 
the United States have ever been made saints in the 
Roman Catholic Church. Two, Saints Elizabeth Seton 
and Katharine Drexel, founded religious orders dedi-
cated to educating the poor. They were canonized in 
1975 and 2000, respectively. The third, Saint Kateri 
Tekakwitha, was canonized in 2012, becoming the 
only Native American saint. Were Father McGivney to 
be elevated to sainthood, he would become the first 
American-born man ever canonized. 

Today, Father Allen says, the Church is looking 
for contemporary Catholics who could be canonized. 
“People we can align ourselves with, instead of some-
body who died in, say, 476, in which case you lose 
the connection with this place and time.” He explains 
that, by 1997, the Knights of Columbus were think-
ing, “We’ve put this off long enough. It’s time to be-
gin the Cause for Father McGivney.”

Every Cause needs an advocate, called a postulator, 
who builds the case for sainthood. The Knights chose 
Father Gabriel O’Donnell, a thoughtful, white-haired

Dominican friar fluent in Italian. He holds a doctor-
ate from the Teresianum, an institute for the study 
of spirituality and theology in Rome. After his ap-
pointment, Father O’Donnell was required to attend 
classes at the Augustinianum, near the Vatican, with 
many other postulators. He was the only American in  
the program. 

After a year of rigorous study at the Augustinia-
num, Father O’Donnell received his certification from 
the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Vatican 
body that oversees the canonization process. He re-
turned to the United States prepared to take the reins 
of the Cause for the Sainthood of Father McGivney. Fa-
ther O’Donnell’s first responsibility as postulator was 
compiling the Acts: extensive historical records and 
documentation of Father McGivney’s life, as well as 
the priest’s own writings. 

To compile the Acts, Father O’Donnell worked 
with the Knights of Columbus archivist. “We spent 
the better part of a year going to the state archives 
in Hartford and going through all the microfiches of 
newspapers and journals to find all the references to 
Father McGivney we could,” he says. “We were able 
to piece together a lot of information about him, a 
whole chronology.” Father O’Donnell tracked down 
Father McGivney’s living relatives to find out more 
about their ancestor. He even traveled to County Ca-
van, Ireland, where Father McGivney’s parents had 
lived before they immigrated to America, to learn 
about the McGivney clan’s history.

O’Donnell’s work was academic, but he says it 
also affected him personally. “Over the course of my 
work,” says Father O’Donnell, “I came to know Father 
McGivney first as a historical figure and then, grad-
ually, as a spiritual ‘friend’ whom I came to admire 
and with whom I developed a personal connection. I 
sensed a kinship with Father McGivney that inspired 
me in my own life as a man and as a priest.”

After two years of research, Father O’Donnell had 
compiled 700 pages on Father McGivney’s life and 
work. In March of 2000, he presented these to Arch-
bishop Cronin at the Hartford Seminary in front of 
a huge audience made up mostly of members of the 
Knights of Columbus. With great ceremony, Archbish-
op Cronin tied the pages of the Acts with red string 
and sealed them with hot wax. This marked his Decree 
of Closure. The local diocesan process was over. The 
Roman process was about to begin.

What seems like a normal suitcase could, in the hands 
of a priest, contain the fate of a possible saint. It was 
now Father O’Donnell’s job to carry the Acts safely to 
the Vatican and deliver them to the Congregation for 
the Causes of Saints. He packed the documents into 
two suitcases and boarded his flight to Rome, wheel-
ing his luggage onto the plane, unwilling to check his 
precious cargo. 

A driver met Father O’Donnell at the airport out-
side of Rome and drove him to the Congregation. 
After arriving at the Palazzo delle Congregazioni, Fa-
ther O’Donnell lugged the suitcases into the build-
ing. “Thank God for the elevator,” he thought, “I don’t 
know if I could drag these up the stairs.” He presented 
the Acts to members of the Congregation, who broke 
the seals, verified that all was in order, and gave the 
Roman process the go-ahead. 

Father O’Donnell spent most of the next two years 
in Rome, as per Congregation rules, writing the Po-
sitio, a volume of biographical information from the 
Acts as well as an examination of Father McGivney’s 
virtue and spirituality. He submitted the completed 
Positio, which was over one thousand pages long, to 
the Congregation in 2002.

Six years later, Father O’Donnell’s efforts on behalf of 
the Cause finally bore fruit: in 2008, the Congrega-
tion for the Causes of Saints approved the Positio and 
recommended that Pope Benedict XVI declare Father 
McGivney Venerable, a decree that officially recog-
nizes a candidate’s heroic virtue. On March 16, 2008 
Pope Benedict XVI declared Father McGivney Vener-
able. There are currently only forty-nine ‘Venerables’ 
awaiting the next steps toward full sainthood. 

Because the Pope issued his decree from the Vati-
can while most of America slept, Father Allen in New 
Haven had not yet heard the news when he awoke 
that morning. It was Palm Sunday, the day that begins 
the Western Christian holy week leading up to Easter. 
He was in the sacristy—a small chamber where the 
priest prepares for a service—at Saint Mary’s, getting 
ready to celebrate the Palm Sunday Mass, when the 
parish secretary told him that a group of journalists 
had gathered outside the church. 

“I asked if they could come back after the Mass,” 
Father Allen recalls, “but they said it couldn’t wait.”

After that Palm Sunday, Father McGivney’s Cause 
faced its greatest challenge yet: proving that God had 
worked miracles through the late priest.

How do you prove a miracle?  The Holy See de-
fines a miracle as some event that has no scientific or 
non-divine explanation. They must agree that God has 
performed a miracle in response to Father McGivney’s 
prayers. After one miracle has been authenticated, Fa-
ther McGivney would be declared Blessed; the next, 
and final stage—canonization—would occur when a 
second miracle is confirmed. But, if miracles attribut-
ed to a candidate for sainthood cannot be proved au-
thentic, the years of work and thousands of pages of 
writing devoted to his Cause could come to nothing.


Hundreds of people have written to the Knights of 
Columbus because they believe Father McGivney in-
terceded in curing their illnesses. Many of the congre-
gants at Saint Mary’s have come to Father Allen report-
ing miracles they attribute to Father McGivney’s aid. 
Yet few of these instances come close to qualifying as 
genuine miracles in the view of the Congregation for 
the Causes of Saints. 

Take, for example, the case of John Walshe, Fa-
ther McGivney’s grandnephew. In 2009, Walshe went 
to Bridgeport Hospital for routine tests after a bout 
of pneumonia. The tests came back showing an ex-
ceptionally high white blood cell count. He was di-
agnosed with aggressive prostate cancer and told he 
would need surgery. 

Several weeks before the operation, Walshe took 
his 16-year-old son aside for a conversation about Fa-
ther Mike. He told his son that he had been saying 
the intercessory prayer to Father McGivney and asked 
him to do the same on his behalf. From that point 
on, until the day of surgery, father and son prayed to 
Father McGivney for a cure. Following the five-hour 
prostatectomy, John Walshe awoke to find the surgeon 
at his bedside, grinning widely. 

“We got it all,” the doctor said.

Today, Walshe remains cancer-free. He believes 
that Father McGivney’s intercession on his behalf was 
at least partly responsible for his cure. But, like many 
others with similar stories, his case does not officially 
qualify as a miracle. After all, who knows if it was 
Father McGivney’s intercession or the surgeon’s skill 
that saved Walshe’s life?

Father Allen, the pastor at Saint Mary’s Church, 
is also a cancer survivor. He, too, believes that con-
stant prayers to Father McGivney were responsible for 
his cure. But hivs melanoma did not vanish without 
explanation—a surgeon removed it in the operating 
room. Neither Father Allen nor Walshe challenge the 
Vatican’s process for determining what is miraculous 
and what isn’t, but both wish that the issue were not 
so black and white. 

“I have given it a lot of thought each day, and 
I believe that my cancer did not go beyond what it 
was precisely because of my devotion to Father Mc-
Givney,” says Father Allen. “A miracle must be instan-
taneous, inexplicable, no medical intervention, and 
so forth. Well, all that is true. But maybe the doctor’s 
knowledge, and his hands, were part of the miracle.” 

However, Father Allen understands the Catholic 
Church’s hesitancy in claiming divine intervention 
in cases where the “miracle” could be attributed to 
medical treatment. In as delicate a matter as miracles, 
which many treat with suspicion anyway, the Church’s 
reputation is at stake.

“The Church could expose itself to ridicule by 
making statements that it must later retract,” he says, 
“should the miracle be disproven [after sainthood is 
granted].” 

In 2000, while working in Rome on the Positio for 
Father McGivney, Father O’Donnell identified an event 
from the 1990s that he thought fulfilled the Vatican’s 
criteria. He helped to prepare a separate Positio for 
the event. (Due to confidentiality rules surrounding 
rejected miracles, he cannot give more details about  
the case.)

“The Positio for a reported miracle,” says Father 
O’Donnell, “includes not only the account of the re-
ported miracle but also all of the medical documents 
involved—every X-ray, every blood test, all of the doc-
tors’ and nurses’ notes. All of that must go into the 
Positio to demonstrate that medical solutions were 
attempted, and failed.” But he explains that “in the 
case of the reported miracle I submitted for Father 
McGivney’s Cause, science did everything it could but 
it didn’t work. It was inexplicable what happened, and 
I felt there was clear evidence of the Digitus Dei, the 
Finger of God.”

The reported miracle passed preliminary vetting 
by a committee of canon lawyers, who ensure that the 
Positio’s account of the event is factual and in keep-
ing with the protocols of the Catholic Church. The 
Positio then moved to the consideration of a board 
of physicians, called the Consulta Medica or the Col-
lege of Doctors. At least nine doctors review each re-
ported miracle. In order for a miracle to gain approval, 
they must rule out any medical explanation for the  
reported event. 

In 2011, after years of deliberation, the medi-
cal committee rejected the reported miracle Father 
O’Donnell submitted for Father McGivney. Without 
revealing anything confidential, Father O’Donnell 
explained why he felt the miracle had not “passed 
muster.” The College of Doctors found that the medi-
cal record for the subject of the reported miracle was 
incomplete, as the hospital where the patient had un-
dergone treatment and testing had not retained all of 
the patient’s X-rays from the relevant time period.

“Because of our advances in science and technol-
ogy, the bar has been raised considerably for prov-
ing a miracle,” say Father O’Donnell. “What two cen-
turies ago you might have been able to ‘prove’ was 
miraculous healing, today would require a lot more 
scientific investigation and documentation. But this 
also means there is greater security that the authen-
ticated event is actually miraculous. The Holy See will 
only accept as miraculous something that truly has no  
other explanation.”

After the 2011 rejection of the first reported miracle, 
a new postulator, Andrea Ambrosi, prepared the Posi-
tio for a second. (Father O’Donnell had since stepped 
down from his role as postulator and now heads the 
Knight of Columbus organization’s Father McGivney 
Guild.) Vice-Postulator for the Cause Brian Caul-
field, who works at the Knights of Columbus head-
quarters in New Haven, is hopeful that the reported 
miracle will soon move to the College of Doctors for  
medical review.

“If anything it gives me confidence in the integ-
rity of the process that it is so strict,” he says. “We 
would all like to see Father McGivney beatified as 
soon as possible, but there is a great amount of careful 
examination needed in these cases.”

Father McGivney is a long way from official saint-
hood. Even if the Pope beatifies him, it will require 
another authenticated miracle to move from Blessed 
to Saint. Still, Father McGivney’s supporters remain 
hopeful. The Catholic Church has struggled in re-
cent decades to maintain its strength—especially in 
the United States. Sex-abuse scandals have called the 
Church’s moral authority into question and tarnished 
much of America’s view of the priesthood. Morale 
amongst priests has dwindled, along with their num-
bers. Every advancement of Father McGivney, a priest 
himself—“one of their own,” as Father Allen says—
toward sainthood is a source of pride and inspiration 
for the American clergy. 

“The Cause,” says Father O’Donnell, “is good in-
strument to give a more positive face to the priests 
and improve their perception in the world.”

One afternoon, while sitting at his desk in the priory, 
Father Allen explains that “[Father McGivney] could 
be beatified very soon. It might even happen when 
Pope Francis visits the United States next September, 
but of course we don’t know for sure. As for Father 
McGivney’s sainthood, well, when that happens we’ll 
be more prepared than anyone.”

He rises from his chair and walks to the shelves 
in the corner of his office. He pulls out several lami-
nated blueprints, his architectural plans for the long-
awaited day when Father McGivney may be canon-
ized. Father Allen has plans to move Father McGivney’s 
marble sarcophagus to the front of the church, where 
the altar now stands, so that the congregation that is 
devoted to their former parish priest can view their 
patron saint’s memorial in full splendor. 

Father Allen has the new lighting plan all figured 
out, down to the last bulb. He has even started to 
calculate how much it will cost to install more bath-
rooms—after all, he will need to accommodate the 
crowds he anticipates will flock to Saint Mary’s to visit 
the resting place of Saint Michael McGivney.

Still, Father Allen says, there is no need to wait for 
an official decree of sainthood to honor Father Mc-
Givney’s spiritual inspiration and legacy. 

“Whether by divine providence Father McGivney 
is raised to Blessed or is canonized in itself is very 
important,” says Father Allen, “but our work does not 
depend upon that.”

As Father Allen told his congregation, Jesus alone 
could not grant sight to the two blind men of Jeri-
cho. It took their faith to bring the miracle. Father 
McGivney’s greatest power, then, may not be miracles 
worked from the grave, but the fervor he inspires in 
the believers at Saint Mary’s Church as they honor him 
in their daily prayers.

Edward Columbia is a freshman
in  Morse College.

ON MARCH 29, 1882, HE FOUNDED THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS 
TO PROVIDE INSURANCE TO CATHOLIC FAMILIES. TODAY, MORE 
THAN 1.8 MILLION MEN ACROSS THE WORLD BELONG 
TO THE ORGANIZATION.

TODAY, FATHER ALLEN SAYS, THE CHURCH IS LOOKING FOR 
CONTEMPORARY CATHOLICS WHO COULD BE CANONIZED. 
“PEOPLE WE CAN ALIGN OURSELVES WITH.”

NEW HAVEN’S PUNK 
SCENE LIVES ON IN THE 
BASEMENTS OF SOME ITS 
MOST DIE-HARD FANS

walked up the uneven stairs to the Panty 
House’s front porch on a Sunday night in 
November. A group of twenty-somethings 
with bull-ring nose piercings, shaggy beards 
and long, purple-streaked hair sat on the patio 
smoking. They nodded silently as I entered. 

Less than three miles from Yale’s campus, 
this “female house of punk,” as described by 
resident Kayla Bastos, was hosting a concert 
by New Haven band Mute Witness. Their front 
man, Ed Goodfriend, had warned me not to 
spread word about the show’s location too 
widely or publish the address. Doing so could 
attract police attention to the unofficial con-
cert venue and result in fines for those who 
live there. There was no entrance fee, but Chris 
Szczerba, a punk enthusiast who helps book 
shows for local bands, collected contributions 
in the living room. His black felt top hat was 
filled with crumpled singles. Inside the warm 
living room, a dozen people passed around 
steaming mugs of cider and a small black Lab-
rador retriever puppy.

THE NEW JOURNAL

On any other day, the living room of this old, 
white house could only be described as quaint. The 
couches were strewn with sweaters, the bookshelves 
overstuffed with books—and in the corner sat a box 
of kitty litter. But its fresh-cut flowers, vintage cande-
labra, and handmade quilts were hard to spot, as about 
thirty people passed through the room that night. 
“We’re ready for ya!” someone called from 
downstairs, and the crowd filed down a narrow stair-
case to the house’s basement. I ran my fingers along 
the cement walls covered in torn concert posters, 
some designed by Bastos herself. They were embla-
zoned with the names of punk bands like Foulmouth, 
Modern Horror, and Nursery Crimes. On a large sil-
ver tank against the basement’s back wall, a banner 
of colorful letters spelled out “DICK FART.” Christmas 
lights illuminated a chalkboard on which someone 
had scrawled that night’s performers: Mountain Man, 
Nervous System, Mute Witness, Rage, and Throw Shit 
Away. 

The Facebook event page describes Mute Witness’s 
sound as “worship but not emulation of metalcore 
made back before that got to be a dirty word. Politi-
cal hardcore.” Goodfriend jumped around, screaming 
lyrics that were rendered inaudible by thrashing gui-
tars and a thumping bass. He danced with audience 
members and shoved the microphone into their faces 
so they could scream along. I felt the basement floor 
vibrate beneath my feet. The music grated on my ears, 
but the crowd’s energy and rapture made me nod 
along. A sweaty Goodfriend paused between songs to 
look into the crowd and say, “Thank you to all who 
work for punk rock, to do something unconventional 
in homes like these.” I caught sight of Bastos in the 
crowd, eyes half-closed beneath her pink bangs. She 
was smiling softly and nodding her head to the music, 
a punk at peace.

But she wouldn’t be at peace for long. It was one 
of the last concerts ever to be hosted at this New Ha-
ven punk venue. Just weeks later, the Panty House 
would be shut down—going the way of punk rock 
houses across the nation. Residential dwelling by day, 
crowded venue by night—these homes violate legal 
regulations because they are not registered venues. 
But the law isn’t the only thing leading to their de-
cline. As people move in and out of new homes, the 
stress of hosting large groups of people at wild con-
certs often deters punk fans from holding concerts in 
their own basements

When I visited, Panty House, along with a hand-
ful of other house venues in New Haven, had hosted 
shows every few weeks since 2012. Since Bastos and 
her friends moved there, the house had become more 
than the place where five women, a gray cat, a shaggy 
brown dog, and the occasional male slept and ate. Bas-
tos and Emily Byram, who form the musical duo known 
as Circle Circle, practiced and performed their folk-pop 
tunes with banjo and ukulele in the living room. At 
night, young punk bands rocked the basement so loudly 
that Bastos’s cat Mishka scurried across the floorboards 
upstairs. But the scene looked tame compared to the no-
torious New Haven stages of the 1970s and 1980s. 

New Haven’s punk clubs were known to look rough 
on the outside and worse on the inside. As punk grew 
popular internationally, the city became notable for 
local bands such as the Saucers, Sperm Donor, and the 
Poodles. Big-ticket musicians, including the Ramones, 
the B-52s, and Blondie, stopped by while traveling be-
tween New York and Boston. With both teenage rock-
ers and celebrities passing through, the New Haven 
punk community coalesced around “unpretentious, 
fist-banging, working-man music,” said John Stone, 
a member of the New Haven band 10,000 Blades. 

Though the punk market has shrunk over the past few 
decades, the rebellious spirit of the rockers remains in 
residential basements, alive but out of public view. It 
is a gentler punk, with a close-knit but open commu-
nity that revives the raucous spirit of the past in pri-
vate spaces. Most concertgoers at the Panty House, for 
example, knew those who lived there, as well as those 
performing. Still, anyone could receive the house ad-
dress via e-mail a few hours before a show. 

New Haven’s most famous punk rock venue was 
Ron’s Place, once on the corner of Park and Chapel 
Streets. In the 1970s, Doc Marten combat boots stuck 
to the club’s beer-soaked floors, and the running joke 
was not to use its toilets, lest you get crabs. But its 
dance floor was “packed every night of the week,” said 
Jim Martin, a member of New Haven’s original punk 
scene and the front man of the local band Chem-trails. 
I met Martin in October at the now-closed An-
chor Bar. Dressed in all leather, Martin was hard to 
miss. When he slid into a booth by the near-empty 
bar and stuck out his hand, I noticed that his knuckles 
revealed the faint outlines of a rag-tag tattoo done by 
friends. His forearms are covered with tattoos of the 
names of all of his former bands, along with the man-
tra “Born a rocker, die a rocker.” Having been a regular 
at punk clubs since age fourteen, Martin spoke about 
the local stages he once played with his former punk 
band, Broken.

In the 1980s, the Connecticut punk scene grew 
from New Haven to Stamford, Bridgeport, Hartford, 
and New London, with new clubs popping up across 
the state. But by the late nineties, as interest in the mu-
sic faded, most of these once-crowded punk venues 
shut down. Punk became memorialized in numerous 
retrospective documentaries, exhibits, and perfor-
mances. Meanwhile, its pioneers grew older and put 
down their electric guitars. 

In New Haven, though, musicians from the Golden 
Age of punk are now training a new generation of 
head-bangers and guitar thrashers who strut their 
stuff in the kind of basements where the genre origi-
nated. Though these venues are small, the music is as 
loud as it was decades ago.

The Panty House and similar establishments celebrate 
anti-establishment eccentrics, but they have tried to 
stay away from the less-than-lovely faces of punk. In 
the original club punk scene in New Haven, Martin 
says, “there were creepy factions, factions that hated 
people.” It was a time when homophobia and racism 
were more often publicly encountered than they are 
today. Martin remembers the angry skinhead punks 
of the eighties, the “Nazi garbage” who once tried to 
stab him at a concert. 

The house venues of today are different. “The 
scene self-polices,” Martin said. “People don’t let that 
shit survive, and it hasn’t in New Haven.” Szczerba, an 
employee at the independent booking firm Arc Agen-
cy and the donation collector at Panty House, said 
the current house venues are nothing like the clubs 
where, as a teenager, he broke his ankle three times.

Yet the absence of racism doesn’t mean these 
houses offer family-friendly evenings. “To have a 
house of punk, you need a lawless shithole,” Stone 
said. With citywide efforts to clean up the town, 
opening a legal venue that’s also a “shithole” is not as 
feasible as hosting a show on home turf. Stone’s stu-
dio apartment, dubbed the Yankee Doodle, is one of 
New Haven’s newest house venues, hosting both folk 
and scream-o punk concerts. It follows in the creative, 
rule-breaking tradition of places like the Panty House. 
At house venues, “people are free to create,” Stone 
told me, green eyes widening. “And also to puke off 
balconies.” 

When Bastos and her friends established Panty House, 
they were determined to make it a place where, true 
to the ethos of punk, misfits could feel at home in 
an open-minded feminist environment. On the base-
ment wall, the faint remains of sidewalk chalk scrib-

ble read in capitalized lettering: “No sexism, no rac-
ism, no homophobia. Don’t be a jerk.” Bastos’s house 
rules basically end there. Panty House is meant to feel 
respectful but also irreverent. 

A few weeks after the concert, Bastos invited 
me back to Panty House for a tour. I followed her as 
she darted into the kitchen. On a corkboard by the 
fridge, Bastos had pinned thank-you notes from out-
of-town bands that came to perform and crashed on 
her couch. One band, SWAATH, hailing from Maine, 
praised the home for its “max comfort and warmth.” 
On the fridge, someone stuck a magnet from Arc 
Agency, the concert-booking firm at which Bas-
tos is the only female employee. We made a pit stop 
back in the living room before heading downstairs, 
where Bastos flipped through a small brown book,  
a guest log of the Panty House’s visitors.

Bastos giggled, reading choice entries out loud, 
transporting herself back to nights of loud music and 
drunk dancing. One read, “Wow, will this blunt ever 
end and where is my food also I want to live here 
this is good.” Julia Rodriguez, Bastos’s housemate, en-
tered. She knelt by Bastos and read over her shoulder. 
With a pierced septum and wild, curly streaked hair, 
Rodriguez fits in with the basement’s punk décor. 

Later, we scrolled through dozens of grainy vid-
eos from Panty House concerts, while Bastos provided 
commentary. She laughed at memories of her friends 
and the touring musical idols who performed from 
out-of-town performing on her makeshift stage. We 
watched footage of bands she admires most, from 
Saintseneca, a folk rock group, to Mountain Man, a 
hardcore punk band. “I can’t believe Mountain Man 
played here,” Bastos told me. “I’ve been listening to 
their music since high school. Watching them play,  
in my own house, Wow.” Bastos trailed off, lost  
in memory.

Stone’s Yankee Doodle apartment is, like the Panty 
House, a living museum, reflecting the work and spir-
it of young artists. Stone fills his playing space with 
plants potted in plastic bottles hung from rafters and 
smoothly sanded wooden furniture he made him-
self. Sitting on his couch and opening a Narragansett 
beer, I spied a prosthetic leg on the floor, what ap-
peared to be an antler, a cinderblock, and several half- 
finished paintings. 

Stone’s trio 10,000 Blades took to the makeshift 
stage to practice while I propped my feet on the bright 
orange road work sign that serves as Stone’s coffee 
table. Stylistically, 10,000 Blades falls somewhere be-
tween Bastos’s Circle Circle and Goodfriend’s Mute 
Witness. They certainly aren’t indie folk, but they 
aren’t hardcore punk either. One of Stone’s neighbors 
told him that they weren’t really a punk band. Rather 
than argue, Stone retorted that it’s true—even with 
their high-energy rhythms and wry lyrics, 10,000 
Blades isn’t quite a hardcore punk band. Yet it’s an-
tithetical to the punk ethos to exclude others from a 
genre that’s grown increasingly diverse musically, to 
tell a musician that he is not punk enough to rock. 
It’s punk’s do-it-yourself spirit—not its volume—that 
10,000 Blades embodies.

The members of 10,000 Blades played as if in 
a trance. Sam Carlson closed his eyes while drum-
ming and Stone, jumping around in paint-splattered 
sneakers, sang with his eyes closed and lips pressed 
against the microphone. After an extended guitar 
solo, Stone reemerged. “Not so bad. Fucking hands 
are cold though.” Behind the drum set hung a sheet 
on which he spray-painted “We are in Connecticut 
and it is cold outside,” a tongue-in-cheek homage to 
the state he loves. “I’m here in New Haven intention-
ally,” said Stone. “I give a crap about this beautiful city. 
It has a lot of problems. It needs some TLC, and my 
way to provide that is by hosting shows and playing 
my music.” 

“You should return to where you’re from, and 
work to make that city cool,” added Carlson, look-
ing around the Yankee Doodle approvingly. “Everyone 
moves to New York, but there’s a lot of potential to 
build a great community right where you’re from.” 
Stone and Bastos welcome crowds into their per-
sonal spaces on the condition that their belongings 
are respected with the vigor that punks usually direct 
against the establishment. “I usually shout something 
like, ‘If you break my shit, I’ll slash your tires,’ into 
the mic before shows here,” Stone told me, only half-
joking. After hosting particularly rowdy and drunken 
crowds, Bastos posted a PSA about the Panty House 
on her blog, titled “The Panty House is not a Party 
House,” in which she wrote, “I live 
in a residential neighborhood and 
will not hesitate to kick you the 
fuck out of my house if you can’t 
cooperate with the general house 
rules.” 

Maintaining 
a 
comfortable 
home full of mementos that si-
multaneously functions as a pub-
lic punk rock space is no easy feat. 
“Every time a place pops up, they 
shut down before too long,” Szc-
zerba said, listing bygone New Ha-
ven house venues like the Discovery Zone, the Cookie 
Jar, Fort Flesh, and Submarine. Stone’s Yankee Doodle 
has only hosted shows since last summer, and Bastos 
noted that the Panty House—which hosted concerts 
since 2012—had a uniquely long run by New Haven 
standards. “It’s a really volatile environment to live 
in,” said Goodfriend, who has lived in a few of New 
Haven’s concert houses but grew tired of living in a 
“lawless shitholes,” as he said. Aside from concerns 
about destructive crowds, Bastos endured the constant 
difficulty of keeping an unregistered venue below the 
police’s radar: She knew of house venues across Con-
necticut that were shut down by the police. Bastos was 
“really anal” about making sure that bands start and 
finish on time in accordance with New Haven’s sound 
ordinance. Even so, police have twice received sound 
complaints about the Panty House. “I better not be 
fined,” Bastos had said, biting her pierced lip. 

Bastos was not fined, but she was forced to close 
the house venue. In late November, Bastos was at 
work at The Granola Bar, a café in Westport when she 
received a panicked call from Rodriguez. “There’s a 
huge foreclosure sign on our front lawn,” Rodriguez 
said into the phone, “and the sign says I can’t remove 
it. What do we do?”

“What do we do?” Bastos echoed in her living 
room, seated on the couch and stroking Mishka. The 
five women in their twenties who 
lived at the Panty House had to 
move out by the end of December. 
Bastos’s only recourse was to post 
a photo of herself flipping off the 
foreclosure sign on Facebook, cap-
tioned “RIP Panty House.” 

“I’m incredibly sad,” Bastos 
told me. “I love living here. But 
I’m also a little relieved.” As excit-
ing as it is to plan shows, two years 
had been enough for Bastos. She 
enumerated the anxieties involved 
in running a concert house, chief among them the 
disappointment of sparse crowds. Though the Panty 
House usually summoned a few dozen punk fans to 
its dank basement, “sometimes only ten people show 
up, and that makes me so fucking sad,” Bastos said. 
When crowds were thin, Bastos paid performers out 
of pocket. “I’d hate for them to leave with nothing.”

“It’s so hard to find a good group of people to live 
with, who can afford a house in New Haven and who 
are down to commit to the house concert lifestyle,” 
she said. She, Rodriguez, and Tobias were looking to 
move into an apartment. “It’ll be really nice to not live 
in a house that’s falling apart,” Bastos laughed, and I 
remember the gaping hole in their basement window, 
kicked in by an attempted theft and shoddily patched 
with a square of carpet. “We’ll probably have acoustic 
shows in our apartment, and I’ll always book local 
bands at other venues through Arc Agency,” she as-
sured me. “But first, we’ll have an insane final concert, 
with punk and folk bands,” she said. Her eyes swept 
across the room, from the wilting flowers to an enor-
mous sombrero. “This place is special,” Bastos said. “I 
hope other people pick up where we left off, opening 
up their houses the way we did.” 

The final concert, on December 28th, was the 
biggest one they had ever had. Over a hundred people 
came, to hear punk bands in the basement and Circle 
Circle strumming upstairs. It was a unique melding 
of the punk spirit with the homey vibe of a group of 
women who were sorry to leave the place they had so 
carefully made their own.

On a Saturday evening in early December, two friends 
and I ran through a rainy parking lot and into the 
warmth of Stone’s Yankee Doodle. In a crowd of a 
dozen young adults bathed in gold Christmas lights, 
I listened to the soft sounds of sweater-clad rockers 
sitting cross-legged on Stone’s stage. The Panty House 
might no longer exist, but the sounds of New Haven’s 
do-it-yourself music scene still blur the boundaries, 
recalling punk’s heyday, on a smaller scale. The music 
was honest and sweet, and at a certain point I forgot 
about New Haven’s punk politics and lost myself in 
the songs about finding love and leaving friends and 
jerking off.

So that’s why we’ve done so much to 
put the president in new media envi-
ronments, like Google Hangouts and 
Twitter interviews and getting young 
people to enroll with the Affordable 
Care Act through Between Two 
Ferns, which obviously I know 
is not a real interview, but it was 
a way to reach people and it was 
very effective. 

Not everything we did worked, some 
of it was a little awkward, but by and 
large it was pretty successful. You have to 
be cautious and conservative when you’re deal-
ing with how the president interacts with the me-
dia, but I’m sure there will be things you and I 
can’t even dream of that presidents will be doing in  
ten years.

After graduating from Yale, you worked for the 
Miami Herald and Time magazine. If you were 
graduating this spring with an interest in journal-
ism, what would you be doing?

The economics of it are extremely challenging, up 
and down, from the starting reporter and writer to 
the publisher of any publication. But I think that the 
universe is settling a little bit, and when you look at 
the strength of The New York Times and the Wall 
Street Journal—and the Washington Post is actu-
ally on a rebound—there’s hopefully longevity there 
and they actually have digital strategies as well. 

The most exciting place right now in terms of the 
written word is in the startup universe—not the 
digitization of old media, but publications that have 
started online. Vox.com comes to mind as one that 
is just, I think, excellent. It provides extremely high 
quality reporting and writing. It provides a real public 
service with its approach to explanatory journalism. 
I might gravitate in that direction. In the end, if you 
can get the economics right, there’s always going to 
be a place for long-form magazine journalism, at least 
I hope.

L
ast summer, The Onion published a fake op-ed 
under your byline titled “Well, Time To Go Out 
In Front Of A Bunch Of People And Lie To Them.” 
What do you make of this idea that you and other 
press secretaries are really just in the business  
of deception?

One of the things people ask me, having left the White 
House after five years, three and a half as press secre-
tary, is, don’t you feel liberated now? I felt liberated 
when I went. I wasn’t an advocate, I didn’t take sides 
as a reporter in elections or align with a party or even 
an ideology. Having the opportunity, as I did, to go to 
the White House and work for a president and vice 
president that I believe in and a series of policy initia-
tives that I dealt with and to talk about them was actu-
ally very liberating. That’s my view. And I think it’s a 
little simplistic to say that because you’re representing 
the president and the administration and the country 
that you’re somehow being untruthful.


One allegation often levied against the Obama 
administration is its excessive use of the Es-
pionage Act of 1917 to go after whistleblow-
ers. Is it at odds with Obama’s promises of  
increased transparency?

For the people who say blindly that this administra-
tion is an enemy of the free press, it’s just ridiculous. 
It very strongly supports shield laws and has pushed 
Congress on that. The new standards are the best there 
have ever been. The fact of the matter is that you have 
a convergence of existing cases that were started un-
der the Bush administration and technologies that are 
so different now. When there are national security 
leaks, it’s serious. There are consequences, they can be 
sometimes extremely damaging.

I’m curious to hear about your switching sides, so 
to speak, from journalist to press secretary. You 
told The New York Times, “If I had known then 
what I know now, I would have suc-
cumbed less often to chasing the 
same soccer ball down the field that 
everybody else was.” Do you think 
the press often succumbs to a herd 
mentality?

In Washington, every issue or challenge 
or problem or obstacle is a sensation 
or scandal. When that happens, there is 
a starting gun that goes off and people 
chase the story. And sometimes when you 
get a mass of high-profile reporters from the 
most prominent news organizations chasing 
the same story, it suggests a legitimacy to the underlying 
story that may not be there. Sometimes it is. Obviously 
there is a lot of important stuff that happens, a lot of bad 
things have happened in government and policy. But I 
think there is a lot of hyperventilating, and things turn 
out to be a lot less important than the reporting at the  
time suggested.

The instinct is correct to hold power accountable. That 
instinct needs to be nurtured, but there need to be edi-
tors and others around who have the perspective to 
know when a story is Watergate or not. Everything be-
comes “the worst thing since….” There’s only going 
to be one Katrina. There’s only going to be one Water-
gate. There’s an effort to hype every story beyond what 
the facts can bear. And I don’t think it’s a conspiracy, 
I just think it’s a function of the way the press works  
in Washington.

The administration went out of its way to give 
interviews to and to take questions at press con-
ferences from new media ventures like the Huff-
ington Post. Where do you think the president a 
generation from now will be giving interviews to? 
When I was at the White House, you still always had 
to find your audience. It’s just a lot more complicated 
now than it was under Reagan and Bush and even to 
some degree Clinton. For this president and his suc-
cessor, it will just be more of a challenge. If he gives a 
major speech in the afternoon, it’s almost a guarantee 
that no one will even know it happened. It’s no longer 
likely even that network news will cover it. If they do, 
their audiences have shrunk dramatically. 

Jay Carney ’87, a former managing editor of the 
New Journal, served as the 29th White House 
press secretary until his resignation this past 
May. He is now working as a commentator for 
CNN. He spoke with TNJ about politics, media, 
and whether or not The Onion has it right.

The old woman's shawl, a faded rose, lay abandoned on the park bench.  A half-eaten apple, browning at the edges, sat beside it.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, stretching and distorting the familiar shapes of the playground equipment.  Gone.  Just gone.

The city sleeps, a concrete giant,
Its breath, a sigh of exhaust fumes.
The moon, a pale eye, watches over it all,
A silent witness to the night's dark bloom.

My grandmother's hands, gnarled and strong, moved with a grace that belied their age.  Each thread, a story whispered through the loom, a tapestry woven with years of laughter and tears, of joy and sorrow.  The patterns, intricate and beautiful, held secrets only she could understand.  Now, her loom sits silent, the threads still, awaiting a hand that will never come.
