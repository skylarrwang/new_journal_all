found its way to the Beinecke in September when ju-
nior Katie Stoops checked it out, for pleasure reading. 
One of the book’s first pages says that it is “of su-
perior issue.” Intrigued, Stoops 
researched the book’s history. 
She learned that the Dutch pa-
per the book was printed on 
makes it extraordinarily valu-
able. To make the paper, fine 
linens were steeped in water 
and dried between different 
coatings of salts, liquors, and 
acids of fermented rye or but-termilk. The linens were dried 
and re-wetted for weeks un-
til they were white and sturdy 
enough for printing. 
When she discovered the 
book’s value—a UK book-
shop lists the volume on Abe-
Books, an online book mar-
ketplace, for $11,711.10—she felt uncomfortable 
being in possession of a book with such “historical 
and monetary” value. After contacting Sterling Me-
morial Library, Stoops gave the book to Brian Kiss, 
who works in the circulation department there. 
Kiss quickly brought Le Morte D’Arthur to the Bei-
necke through the basement tunnel that connects the  
two libraries.

Stoops’s story is unusual, 
but not unheard of at Yale. About 
once a month, someone dis-
covers a rare or very old book, 
potentially worth more than a 
thousand dollars, in the Ster-
ling collection. It is then moved 
over to the Beinecke. Though 
old and fragile books still turn 
up occasionally, Kiss said that 
it’s uncommon for books as 
rare—and as valuable—as Le 
Morte d’Arthur to be found in the stacks, available  
for circulation.  

In the past eleven years, Yale’s libraries have made 
an effort to move all rare and fragile books to the 
Beinecke. The library’s staffers combed through the 
Sterling stacks in 2004 as part of a major project to 
move thousands of books into their collection. Sarah 
Schmidt, head of printed acquisitions at the Beinecke, 
said they were looking for everything published be-
fore 1800. At any given time, four staff members 
and two students were assigned to the project. They 
methodically went through 
the library catalogue, finding 
the call numbers of rare books 
and collecting them from the 
stacks. George Miles, a curator 
of Western Americana at the 
Beinecke, says that he knows 
the project didn’t find all of the 
rare books, but “we felt pretty 
confident that we got most of 
them.”

In 2006, the former Cross 
Campus Library was renovated 
to become today’s Bass Library. 
During the construction, its 
books took up temporary resi-
dence in Sterling. Kiss helped 
re-shelve Sterling’s books to 
make room for the Cross Campus collection. It was, 
he says, “the first time in a long time that people had 
put their hands on literally every single book in the 
entire library.” While moving the books back to the 
newly opened Bass in 2007, Beinecke staffers were in-
structed to put aside any book printed before 1800 so 
that these books could be moved to the Beinecke col-
lection. “They found tons and tons of stuff,” Kiss says. 
Many of the books were small, 
pages numbered with Roman 
numerals. Most were not writ-
ten in English. Hundreds were 
transferred to the Beinecke. 
Kiss explains that books 
printed in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries circulat-
ing in Sterling were not part 
of the project. The scope of the 
transfer was already so large 
that including newer books in 
the search would have added an enormous amount of 
work for the librarians. That may be one reason that 
the Dutch paper edition of Le Morte d’Arthur, which 
was printed after 1800, remained in the stacks.

But books are moved to the Beinecke for reasons 
other than old age. Some are very fragile—for exam-
ple, historical political pamphlets and booklets. Oth-
ers might be particularly difficult to replace. Even so, if

COLLECTION. 

the Beinecke already has a copy of a rare book—even 
if it is worth a significant sum of money—multiple 
copies are allowed to stay in Sterling so that library 
patrons can access them. This could be a second reason 
why Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur was overlooked 
in Sterling: the Beinecke already held two older copies of 
Malory’s book when Stoops discovered the 1838 edition. 
However, because of its Dutch paper, this 1838 edition was 
even more valuable than its counterparts in Beinecke. 
Only by flipping through its pages could someone real-
ize its significance. 

So, some rare books still linger in Sterling. While Yale’s 
librarians want to make its collection of over fifteen mil-
lion volumes available for research, they also want to en-
sure that the books are properly preserved. Though books

in the Beinecke collection are not in open stacks, students 
and researchers can read them in the reading rooms. 
“The library system at large is looking to balance secu-
rity with accessibility,” Miles says. “It’s one of the hardest 
questions that libraries face. They want to serve today’s 
readers as well as tomorrow’s.” As a result, books like the 
illustrated Dutch-paper Le Morte d’Arthur may continue 
to wind up on the desks of students who are unaware of  
their value.

“I would imagine,” Miles says, “that there will al-
ways be a few books in Sterling that we are surprised 
to discover are still there.”


**Title: haunted haven**
**Author: Libbie Katsev**

“P
oint five’s nothing. In New Haven, we  
get sevens.”

Chrystyne McGrath stands outside of the Star-
bucks at the intersection of Chapel and High Streets, 
surrounded by a crowd of about forty people. She 
holds up a black box the size of a graphing calculator. 
It’s an EMF meter, a scientific instrument that mea-
sures changes in electromagnetic fields. A small screen 
displays a single number. If the number is at least 0.5, 
McGrath says, then the machine might be detecting 
a ghost.

The EMF meter is one of a ghost hunter’s primary 
tools, but McGrath is less of a hunter and more of a 
guide. On this cold Friday night in early November, 
she’s leading us on a ghost tour of New Haven. Mc-
Grath is wearing a silver down coat and a hat with a 
leopard-print band. By day, she works at the Health 
Options Center for Wellness in Guilford, which of-
fers a smorgasbord of alternative medicine options in-
cluding herbal treatments and hypnotherapy. By night, 
she leads tours for the New Haven division of Ghost 
Walks USA, which also offers tours in New York City, 
Washington, D.C., and Palm Beach, Florida. 

Before we get started, McGrath gives us a crash 
course in ghost physics. When we die, there’s a light. 
If our spirits go into the light, they pass on; if not, 
they stay here and haunt the living, hovering one foot 
above the ground and feeding the local ghost tour-
ism industry. In a symbiotic relationship, the tourism 
industry feeds the ghosts. Ghosts consume electricity, 
according to McGrath, which is why EMF meters can 
detect them. She warns us our phones are likely to go 
dead, but to keep them ready anyway: Ghosts can be 
captured on camera as glowing orbs or bright streaks 
of light. Often, orbs appear in the photos the morning 
after – charging your cell phone overnight feeds the 
spirits, who then decide to grace your pictures with 
their presence.

McGrath asks if anyone has experienced a ghost 
before. Most people stay silent, but one man in a black 
jacket raises his hand. Later, he’ll volunteer to knock 
on the door of the Skull and Bones tomb, the first stop 
on tonight’s tour. 

We stop at about a dozen places, including secret

society tombs, Sterling Memorial Library, the Grove 
Street Cemetery, Yale’s visitor center, and City Hall. On 
the way, we get a good dose of New Haven history, ev-
erything from the Amistad up-
rising to Hurricane Sandy. This 
history is full of ghosts. Some 
are historical figures like Cor-
nelius Vanderbilt, and others 
are prominent local legends. 
Mary Hart, better known 
as Midnight Mary, haunts Ev-
ergreen Cemetery, near the 
intersection of Columbus Av-
enue and Ella T. Grasso Boule-
vard. The tour doesn’t stop at 
Evergreen Cemetery, but Mc-
Grath tells the story anyway: 
According to legend, Mid-
night Mary was buried alive. 
And then there are the name-
less spirits, like the murdered girl with long red 
hair who haunts the basement of the New Haven  
Free Public Library.

At Sterling Memorial Library, McGrath shares two 
stories. The first is of a kindly librarian named Auntie, 
who still helps students out with their studies, de-
spite having died decades ago. 

The second is about an entity 
that called itself “Seth.” Back in 
1963, a poet named Jane Rob-
erts was possessed by this spirit. 
While channeling Seth, Roberts 
went on to write many books, 
known as the Seth Material. The 
manuscripts and letters, along 
with some recordings of Jane 
Roberts, ended up in the Ster-
ling Memorial Library’s Manu-
scripts and Archives collection, 
taking up a total of 498 boxes. 

After that, we spend some 
time huddling in front of the 
gates of the Grove Street Cem-
etery. There, the ghosts of soldiers killed in the Revo-
lutionary War greet McGrath, she says. McGrath tells 
us to take pictures, and if our intentions are strong, 
the ghosts will show up for us, too. I guess I’m not 
sincere enough, because I don’t get any orbs, just a 
glowing white blotch in between the bars of the gate. 
It might just be my camera flash reflecting off another 
participant’s cellphone, but I can’t be sure. I do feel 
a cold patch as we walk along the gates of the ceme-
tery—I mean, the entire East Coast is a cold patch, but 
it seems to me that the left side 
of my body is a little bit chillier 
than the right.

The Union Trust Building 
on Church Street now houses 
Wells Fargo. But, almost a cen-
tury ago, a nasty bank teller 
named Eli Wilson skimmed 
money off of other people’s 
savings. He died in accident, 
trapped in the bank’s airtight 
vault. Later, phantoms of laugh-
ing children terrorized the 
men who tried to paint the 
walls. That’s a sure sign that the 
building was once an orphan-
age, McGrath says. Following 
her instructions, I put the EMF 
meter that McGrath had lent to me on the ground 
to see if it will pick up signs of any ghosts. Some of 
the tour’s participants had downloaded an app that al-
lowed their phones to act as EMF meters, so they put 
their phones on the sidewalk.

I had been carrying the EMF meter for much of 
the tour, and it had been fluctuating wildly through-
out the walk. I’m surprised that it doesn’t beep in 
front of the Union Trust Building, even when I lay it 
on the sidewalk. But it goes wild when we’re crossing 
the street. I wonder if it’s a fluke, or if it’s picking up 
the spirit of an unfortunate pedestrian. 

As we head over to the New Haven Green, a man 
on the tour approaches McGrath. He’s got a photo 
with an orb in the window of one of the city hall 
buildings. Can she tell if it’s the real thing? This is it, 
I think: confirmation of the supernatural, or at least 
of…orbs. McGrath looks at the picture. She says it 
looks like a light fixture.

We stop in the middle 
of the New Haven Green and 
stand by a plaque that marks 
the ground in front of a sap-
ling. It replaces the old Lincoln 
Oak that came down during 
Hurricane Sandy, skeletons and 
a time capsule tangled in its 
roots.

“The vortex is right here,” 
McGrath says. A vortex is a 
place where energy is concen-
trated, and McGrath said later 
that all high-energy locations—
including burial grounds like 
the New Haven Green—have 
a vortex. McGrath explains that 
the people burying the time 
capsule a century ago had found the vortex using 
dowsing rods, divination tools that pick up electro-
magnetic signals. (Today, there’s an app for that.) She 
invites us to step onto the vortex, and one at a time, 
people do. One woman feels a tingling in her hands. A 
man starts to rock back and forth, slowly.  I’m swaying 
too, where I’m standing, and I know it’s because it’s 
late and I’m tired and naturally unsteady on my feet, 
and I wonder if they’re swaying for the same reason, 
but I don’t take a turn on the vortex hotspot. Maybe 
I’d rather not find out.
