On any other day, the living room of this old, 
white house could only be described as quaint. The 
couches were strewn with sweaters, the bookshelves 
overstuffed with books—and in the corner sat a box 
of kitty litter. But its fresh-cut flowers, vintage cande-
labra, and handmade quilts were hard to spot, as about 
thirty people passed through the room that night. 
“We’re ready for ya!” someone called from 
downstairs, and the crowd filed down a narrow stair-
case to the house’s basement. I ran my fingers along 
the cement walls covered in torn concert posters, 
some designed by Bastos herself. They were embla-
zoned with the names of punk bands like Foulmouth, 
Modern Horror, and Nursery Crimes. On a large sil-
ver tank against the basement’s back wall, a banner 
of colorful letters spelled out “DICK FART.” Christmas 
lights illuminated a chalkboard on which someone 
had scrawled that night’s performers: Mountain Man, 
Nervous System, Mute Witness, Rage, and Throw Shit 
Away. 

The Facebook event page describes Mute Witness’s 
sound as “worship but not emulation of metalcore 
made back before that got to be a dirty word. Politi-
cal hardcore.” Goodfriend jumped around, screaming 
lyrics that were rendered inaudible by thrashing gui-
tars and a thumping bass. He danced with audience 
members and shoved the microphone into their faces 
so they could scream along. I felt the basement floor 
vibrate beneath my feet. The music grated on my ears, 
but the crowd’s energy and rapture made me nod 
along. A sweaty Goodfriend paused between songs to 
look into the crowd and say, “Thank you to all who 
work for punk rock, to do something unconventional 
in homes like these.” I caught sight of Bastos in the 
crowd, eyes half-closed beneath her pink bangs. She 
was smiling softly and nodding her head to the music, 
a punk at peace.

But she wouldn’t be at peace for long. It was one 
of the last concerts ever to be hosted at this New Ha-
ven punk venue. Just weeks later, the Panty House 
would be shut down—going the way of punk rock 
houses across the nation. Residential dwelling by day, 
crowded venue by night—these homes violate legal 
regulations because they are not registered venues. 
But the law isn’t the only thing leading to their de-
cline. As people move in and out of new homes, the 
stress of hosting large groups of people at wild con-
certs often deters punk fans from holding concerts in 
their own basements

When I visited, Panty House, along with a hand-
ful of other house venues in New Haven, had hosted 
shows every few weeks since 2012. Since Bastos and 
her friends moved there, the house had become more 
than the place where five women, a gray cat, a shaggy 
brown dog, and the occasional male slept and ate. Bas-
tos and Emily Byram, who form the musical duo known 
as Circle Circle, practiced and performed their folk-pop 
tunes with banjo and ukulele in the living room. At 
night, young punk bands rocked the basement so loudly 
that Bastos’s cat Mishka scurried across the floorboards 
upstairs. But the scene looked tame compared to the no-
torious New Haven stages of the 1970s and 1980s. 

New Haven’s punk clubs were known to look rough 
on the outside and worse on the inside. As punk grew 
popular internationally, the city became notable for 
local bands such as the Saucers, Sperm Donor, and the 
Poodles. Big-ticket musicians, including the Ramones, 
the B-52s, and Blondie, stopped by while traveling be-
tween New York and Boston. With both teenage rock-
ers and celebrities passing through, the New Haven 
punk community coalesced around “unpretentious, 
fist-banging, working-man music,” said John Stone, 
a member of the New Haven band 10,000 Blades. 

Though the punk market has shrunk over the past few 
decades, the rebellious spirit of the rockers remains in 
residential basements, alive but out of public view. It 
is a gentler punk, with a close-knit but open commu-
nity that revives the raucous spirit of the past in pri-
vate spaces. Most concertgoers at the Panty House, for 
example, knew those who lived there, as well as those 
performing. Still, anyone could receive the house ad-
dress via e-mail a few hours before a show. 

New Haven’s most famous punk rock venue was 
Ron’s Place, once on the corner of Park and Chapel 
Streets. In the 1970s, Doc Marten combat boots stuck 
to the club’s beer-soaked floors, and the running joke 
was not to use its toilets, lest you get crabs. But its 
dance floor was “packed every night of the week,” said 
Jim Martin, a member of New Haven’s original punk 
scene and the front man of the local band Chem-trails. 
I met Martin in October at the now-closed An-
chor Bar. Dressed in all leather, Martin was hard to 
miss. When he slid into a booth by the near-empty 
bar and stuck out his hand, I noticed that his knuckles 
revealed the faint outlines of a rag-tag tattoo done by 
friends. His forearms are covered with tattoos of the 
names of all of his former bands, along with the man-
tra “Born a rocker, die a rocker.” Having been a regular 
at punk clubs since age fourteen, Martin spoke about 
the local stages he once played with his former punk 
band, Broken.

In the 1980s, the Connecticut punk scene grew 
from New Haven to Stamford, Bridgeport, Hartford, 
and New London, with new clubs popping up across 
the state. But by the late nineties, as interest in the mu-
sic faded, most of these once-crowded punk venues 
shut down. Punk became memorialized in numerous 
retrospective documentaries, exhibits, and perfor-
mances. Meanwhile, its pioneers grew older and put 
down their electric guitars. 

In New Haven, though, musicians from the Golden 
Age of punk are now training a new generation of 
head-bangers and guitar thrashers who strut their 
stuff in the kind of basements where the genre origi-
nated. Though these venues are small, the music is as 
loud as it was decades ago.

The Panty House and similar establishments celebrate 
anti-establishment eccentrics, but they have tried to 
stay away from the less-than-lovely faces of punk. In 
the original club punk scene in New Haven, Martin 
says, “there were creepy factions, factions that hated 
people.” It was a time when homophobia and racism 
were more often publicly encountered than they are 
today. Martin remembers the angry skinhead punks 
of the eighties, the “Nazi garbage” who once tried to 
stab him at a concert. 

The house venues of today are different. “The 
scene self-polices,” Martin said. “People don’t let that 
shit survive, and it hasn’t in New Haven.” Szczerba, an 
employee at the independent booking firm Arc Agen-
cy and the donation collector at Panty House, said 
the current house venues are nothing like the clubs 
where, as a teenager, he broke his ankle three times.

Yet the absence of racism doesn’t mean these 
houses offer family-friendly evenings. “To have a 
house of punk, you need a lawless shithole,” Stone 
said. With citywide efforts to clean up the town, 
opening a legal venue that’s also a “shithole” is not as 
feasible as hosting a show on home turf. Stone’s stu-
dio apartment, dubbed the Yankee Doodle, is one of 
New Haven’s newest house venues, hosting both folk 
and scream-o punk concerts. It follows in the creative, 
rule-breaking tradition of places like the Panty House. 
At house venues, “people are free to create,” Stone 
told me, green eyes widening. “And also to puke off 
balconies.” 

When Bastos and her friends established Panty House, 
they were determined to make it a place where, true 
to the ethos of punk, misfits could feel at home in 
an open-minded feminist environment. On the base-
ment wall, the faint remains of sidewalk chalk scrib-

ble read in capitalized lettering: “No sexism, no rac-
ism, no homophobia. Don’t be a jerk.” Bastos’s house 
rules basically end there. Panty House is meant to feel 
respectful but also irreverent. 

A few weeks after the concert, Bastos invited 
me back to Panty House for a tour. I followed her as 
she darted into the kitchen. On a corkboard by the 
fridge, Bastos had pinned thank-you notes from out-
of-town bands that came to perform and crashed on 
her couch. One band, SWAATH, hailing from Maine, 
praised the home for its “max comfort and warmth.” 
On the fridge, someone stuck a magnet from Arc 
Agency, the concert-booking firm at which Bas-
tos is the only female employee. We made a pit stop 
back in the living room before heading downstairs, 
where Bastos flipped through a small brown book,  
a guest log of the Panty House’s visitors.

Bastos giggled, reading choice entries out loud, 
transporting herself back to nights of loud music and 
drunk dancing. One read, “Wow, will this blunt ever 
end and where is my food also I want to live here 
this is good.” Julia Rodriguez, Bastos’s housemate, en-
tered. She knelt by Bastos and read over her shoulder. 
With a pierced septum and wild, curly streaked hair, 
Rodriguez fits in with the basement’s punk décor. 

Later, we scrolled through dozens of grainy vid-
eos from Panty House concerts, while Bastos provided 
commentary. She laughed at memories of her friends 
and the touring musical idols who performed from 
out-of-town performing on her makeshift stage. We 
watched footage of bands she admires most, from 
Saintseneca, a folk rock group, to Mountain Man, a 
hardcore punk band. “I can’t believe Mountain Man 
played here,” Bastos told me. “I’ve been listening to 
their music since high school. Watching them play,  
in my own house, Wow.” Bastos trailed off, lost  
in memory.

Stone’s Yankee Doodle apartment is, like the Panty 
House, a living museum, reflecting the work and spir-
it of young artists. Stone fills his playing space with 
plants potted in plastic bottles hung from rafters and 
smoothly sanded wooden furniture he made him-
self. Sitting on his couch and opening a Narragansett 
beer, I spied a prosthetic leg on the floor, what ap-
peared to be an antler, a cinderblock, and several half- 
finished paintings. 

Stone’s trio 10,000 Blades took to the makeshift 
stage to practice while I propped my feet on the bright 
orange road work sign that serves as Stone’s coffee 
table. Stylistically, 10,000 Blades falls somewhere be-
tween Bastos’s Circle Circle and Goodfriend’s Mute 
Witness. They certainly aren’t indie folk, but they 
aren’t hardcore punk either. One of Stone’s neighbors 
told him that they weren’t really a punk band. Rather 
than argue, Stone retorted that it’s true—even with 
their high-energy rhythms and wry lyrics, 10,000 
Blades isn’t quite a hardcore punk band. Yet it’s an-
tithetical to the punk ethos to exclude others from a 
genre that’s grown increasingly diverse musically, to 
tell a musician that he is not punk enough to rock. 
It’s punk’s do-it-yourself spirit—not its volume—that 
10,000 Blades embodies.

The members of 10,000 Blades played as if in 
a trance. Sam Carlson closed his eyes while drum-
ming and Stone, jumping around in paint-splattered 
sneakers, sang with his eyes closed and lips pressed 
against the microphone. After an extended guitar 
solo, Stone reemerged. “Not so bad. Fucking hands 
are cold though.” Behind the drum set hung a sheet 
on which he spray-painted “We are in Connecticut 
and it is cold outside,” a tongue-in-cheek homage to 
the state he loves. “I’m here in New Haven intention-
ally,” said Stone. “I give a crap about this beautiful city. 
It has a lot of problems. It needs some TLC, and my 
way to provide that is by hosting shows and playing 
my music.” 

“You should return to where you’re from, and 
work to make that city cool,” added Carlson, look-
ing around the Yankee Doodle approvingly. “Everyone 
moves to New York, but there’s a lot of potential to 
build a great community right where you’re from.” 
Stone and Bastos welcome crowds into their per-
sonal spaces on the condition that their belongings 
are respected with the vigor that punks usually direct 
against the establishment. “I usually shout something 
like, ‘If you break my shit, I’ll slash your tires,’ into 
the mic before shows here,” Stone told me, only half-
joking. After hosting particularly rowdy and drunken 
crowds, Bastos posted a PSA about the Panty House 
on her blog, titled “The Panty House is not a Party 
House,” in which she wrote, “I live 
in a residential neighborhood and 
will not hesitate to kick you the 
fuck out of my house if you can’t 
cooperate with the general house 
rules.” 

Maintaining 
a 
comfortable 
home full of mementos that si-
multaneously functions as a pub-
lic punk rock space is no easy feat. 
“Every time a place pops up, they 
shut down before too long,” Szc-
zerba said, listing bygone New Ha-
ven house venues like the Discovery Zone, the Cookie 
Jar, Fort Flesh, and Submarine. Stone’s Yankee Doodle 
has only hosted shows since last summer, and Bastos 
noted that the Panty House—which hosted concerts 
since 2012—had a uniquely long run by New Haven 
standards. “It’s a really volatile environment to live 
in,” said Goodfriend, who has lived in a few of New 
Haven’s concert houses but grew tired of living in a 
“lawless shitholes,” as he said. Aside from concerns 
about destructive crowds, Bastos endured the constant 
difficulty of keeping an unregistered venue below the 
police’s radar: She knew of house venues across Con-
necticut that were shut down by the police. Bastos was 
“really anal” about making sure that bands start and 
finish on time in accordance with New Haven’s sound 
ordinance. Even so, police have twice received sound 
complaints about the Panty House. “I better not be 
fined,” Bastos had said, biting her pierced lip. 

Bastos was not fined, but she was forced to close 
the house venue. In late November, Bastos was at 
work at The Granola Bar, a café in Westport when she 
received a panicked call from Rodriguez. “There’s a 
huge foreclosure sign on our front lawn,” Rodriguez 
said into the phone, “and the sign says I can’t remove 
it. What do we do?”

“What do we do?” Bastos echoed in her living 
room, seated on the couch and stroking Mishka. The 
five women in their twenties who 
lived at the Panty House had to 
move out by the end of December. 
Bastos’s only recourse was to post 
a photo of herself flipping off the 
foreclosure sign on Facebook, cap-
tioned “RIP Panty House.” 

“I’m incredibly sad,” Bastos 
told me. “I love living here. But 
I’m also a little relieved.” As excit-
ing as it is to plan shows, two years 
had been enough for Bastos. She 
enumerated the anxieties involved 
in running a concert house, chief among them the 
disappointment of sparse crowds. Though the Panty 
House usually summoned a few dozen punk fans to 
its dank basement, “sometimes only ten people show 
up, and that makes me so fucking sad,” Bastos said. 
When crowds were thin, Bastos paid performers out 
of pocket. “I’d hate for them to leave with nothing.”

“It’s so hard to find a good group of people to live 
with, who can afford a house in New Haven and who 
are down to commit to the house concert lifestyle,” 
she said. She, Rodriguez, and Tobias were looking to 
move into an apartment. “It’ll be really nice to not live 
in a house that’s falling apart,” Bastos laughed, and I 
remember the gaping hole in their basement window, 
kicked in by an attempted theft and shoddily patched 
with a square of carpet. “We’ll probably have acoustic 
shows in our apartment, and I’ll always book local 
bands at other venues through Arc Agency,” she as-
sured me. “But first, we’ll have an insane final concert, 
with punk and folk bands,” she said. Her eyes swept 
across the room, from the wilting flowers to an enor-
mous sombrero. “This place is special,” Bastos said. “I 
hope other people pick up where we left off, opening 
up their houses the way we did.” 

The final concert, on December 28th, was the 
biggest one they had ever had. Over a hundred people 
came, to hear punk bands in the basement and Circle 
Circle strumming upstairs. It was a unique melding 
of the punk spirit with the homey vibe of a group of 
women who were sorry to leave the place they had so 
carefully made their own.

On a Saturday evening in early December, two friends 
and I ran through a rainy parking lot and into the 
warmth of Stone’s Yankee Doodle. In a crowd of a 
dozen young adults bathed in gold Christmas lights, 
I listened to the soft sounds of sweater-clad rockers 
sitting cross-legged on Stone’s stage. The Panty House 
might no longer exist, but the sounds of New Haven’s 
do-it-yourself music scene still blur the boundaries, 
recalling punk’s heyday, on a smaller scale. The music 
was honest and sweet, and at a certain point I forgot 
about New Haven’s punk politics and lost myself in 
the songs about finding love and leaving friends and 
jerking off.
