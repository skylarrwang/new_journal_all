in a flurry like down feathers, or Cam pulling it out 
in tufts.
The second was Dante. He was tall, with an imp-
ish smile that showed gaps between all his teeth. He 
grew up in the Pleasant View Acres project. In fifth 
grade, Dante and I used to yell “Two Musketeers!” 
and then press our foreheads together until our brains 
hurt. In high school, Dante played football. He wore 
dark purple polos, and these spotless suede Timber-
lands that were so fly. He went to a state college, but 
he dropped out after a year, and then he dropped out 
of contact.

A rusty iron freight train rolls through Lewiston 
every twelve hours at a speed that seems too slow for a 
train. It blows a low, whale-sound whistle that used to 
re-play in my dreams when I was drowning. At 4:00 
a.m. one morning, Dante left 
his apartment, walked down-
town, and stood on the rail-
road tracks. He just stood there, 
watched the train come, heard 
the whistle, and stood there.

His brother got a stay of 
sentence for his misdemeanor 
conviction to attend his funeral.
Sam was the third to die. I 
knew her the least well of the 
three, but it was impossible not 
to like her. She was loud and 
friendly, always cursing brightly 
and dancing in the hallways. She had a semi-ironic 
obsession with Spongebob Squarepants, and she used 
to carry around pineapple-house erasers, wear starfish 
t-shirts, and burst randomly into the theme song in 
full-on pirate-accent.

I lost touch with Sam when I graduated, and she 
took an extra year to finish school. I saw her again 
the November before she died, three and a half years 
later. We were at the Blue Goose, a bar that’s small 
and damp and black like a hole in the earth. Sam was 
drunk. So was I. She had gained some weight. She had 
a little freckle on her chin that I had never noticed be-
fore. She wanted to hear about college. I told her that I 
was taking the year off to sing with the Whiffenpoofs. 
I’m always embarrassed to talk about Yale back home, 
so I added,“That’s pretty pretentious right?” She just 
called me “kid” in this affectionate way that I’ve only 
ever heard in Lewiston. She said, “Yeah, kid, but it 
sounds fun.” She had just enrolled in a local college. 
She wanted to be a teacher.

At 2:00 a.m. on July 27th, Sam was driving her 
family’s Ford Focus down Buxton Road, drunk and 
screaming-fast. She swerved off the road and hit a 
telephone pole. The Ford flipped and landed on the 
driver side. The metal scrunched, crushing her in her 
seat. They closed the road for two hours to fix the tele-
phone pole, and then opened it right back up again.

Life in Lewiston has an undertow of desperation. 
It’s the kind of small, poor town where everyone’s 
family settled there in the 1850s to work in the mills, 
and they’ve all been working the same kind of blue 
collar jobs ever since. The mills are closed now, so they 
work in the Tampax factory, or the Country Kitchen 
Donuts factory, or they don’t work at all. Kids call it 
the Armpit of Maine, or the Dirty Lew. They dream of 
leaving, throwing all of their belongings in a mud-
crusted Ram pickup and driving south-west forever, 
but they never do.

I didn’t feel desperation to leave, growing up. 
My parents moved to Lewiston in the ’90s to teach 
anthropology at a nearby liberal arts college. Lew-
iston was their chosen home, so that’s how it al-
ways felt for me. But as graduation drew closer, 
it became increasingly inevitable that I was going 
to leave (whether I wanted to or not), and that my 
friends were going to stay, stuck, like in a bad dream 
where you’re thrashing but something’s got you by  
the ankles.

Mourning brings people in Lewiston together 
like nothing I’ve ever seen, though minor league ice 
hockey runs a close second. Everyone in Lewiston re-
members being young and bored and trapped. They 
don’t just grieve for one person’s death; they grieve 
for the town, for the kind of place where kids die try-
ing to get out. It’s intense, public, ebullient grief. It’s 
the whole town in matching white shirts, releasing 
orange balloons strung with letters to the dead. These 
kids die praying to break free, but strangely, wonder-
fully, their deaths draw the community into an even 
tighter circle.

I mourn vicariously for Sam, through photos on 
Facebook. I see six tattoos of Sam’s name, surrounded 
by tropical flowers, on two left feet, one bare chest, 
one forearm, one shoulder, and one delicate shoulder 
blade. I see three rear windshield graphics reading In 
Loving Memory Samantha 1992-2014, with match-
ing decals of Spongebob Squarepants lying on his 
side, batting long, playful eyelashes like Sam’s. I see 
two pieces of Sam-inspired jewelry: one locket hold-
ing a little bit of a bumper sticker from Sam’s car, one 
bracelet with an inscription of Sam’s name. And I see 
one roadside shrine, by the telephone pole on Buxton 
Road where she died. Stuck in the ground is a make-
shift white cross, and above it float two Spongebob 
balloons. I find six pictures of the shrine, and when I 
put them in the right order, they make a time-lapse. 
The balloons drift slowly to the ground, and visitors 
pile the cross so high with bouquets that you can’t see 
it anymore.

The summer that Sam dies, I’m on a twenty-seven 
country world tour with the Whiffenpoofs. We travel 
to a new city every forty-eight hours, and it’s exhila-
rating and disorienting. In East Africa, I start pretend-
ing I’m sleeping in my own bed. In the Middle East, 
I turn to Google Maps, and stare at satellite images of 
my house. I watch Lewiston’s post-crash convulsions 
from Southeast Asia, plunged in the deepest pit of my 
homesickness. I want to be there. I want to do some-
thing for Sam—something big, like a tattoo, or a bou-
quet by the cross. Maybe it’s selfish, but I want to be 
a part of Lewiston’s special kind of grief-celebration.

But I left. I was never trapped in Lewiston, and 
now I’m gone. This distance has never been more 
pronounced than when I’m traveling the world with 
a Yale singing group, stuffing myself into tailcoats, 
pretending I knew that you were supposed to hold a 
champagne glass by the stem, or call it a “flute.” The 
departure has become too spectacular now, too gaudy. 
It cuts me off, disinherits me from the right to mourn 
for Sam and my hometown. What could I possibly say 
about Sam’s death? What do I know about her life?

I sit on my hotel bed in Cambodia, my face bath-
ing in the laptop’s blue light. The picture’s there, and 
there’s a freckle on her chin. I’m wondering if this is a 
silence that will lead me to slip away from home for-
ever. And I’m wondering if it would be too much—or 
not nearly enough—to break it, and click a few keys.

I’m sorry, @Sam
Or
@Sam, rest easy

one of Sam in high school, poised to dive down a 
water slide slicked with baby oil. Sherry posts one of 
Sam as she was just before she died: twenty-two years 
old, creamy skin, highlights in her hair, hoop ear-
rings, deep dimples, crooked laughing bottom teeth, 
wet-looking eyes.

Lewiston, Maine is spilling guts on the internet 
today, and I want to look away, but I can’t. Some of 
the most enthusiastic grievers barely knew Sam at all. 
There’s something inviting about this kind of exhibi-
tionist mourning. I’m halfway around the world, on 
tour with the Yale Whiffenpoofs, and all I want to do 
is take part, send something home, a few sad words, 
wrapped in a comment box. I want to write about how 
she died so young that now her death will be the big-
gest thing that ever happened to her. How it will seem 
like the whole point of her life 
but it wasn’t, it couldn’t have 
been. My fingers hover over 
the keys, jittery. I don’t write  
a word.

This is not the first time 
that one of my classmates has 
died in the few years since I 
graduated from Lewiston High 
School. Andrew was the first. He 
was a giant with a soft, round 
face. He lived in a run-down 
complex on Bartlett Street. He 
had a booming bass voice, and 
he used to cheer so loudly at football games that the 
coach would kick him off of school property. When 
he sang, you felt it rumble in your chest like your 
body was against a dryer. He wanted to be a singer. 
The last time I saw Andrew was at graduation. He 
wasn’t walking, but he cheered from the bleachers. 
After the fanfare, he walked up to me with puffy eyes, 
and this goofy swagger like he didn’t have a care in 
the world. He told me that he was going to take sum-
mer classes and graduate within a year. One more year 
wouldn’t be so bad.

During that year, Andrew overdosed on bath salts. 
The police said they couldn’t be sure, but we all knew 
it was bath salts. I couldn’t make it back for the funer-
al. A few weeks later, I went home and hung out with 
Cam, who was with Andrew the night he died. Cam 
was nineteen, and bald. I guess he had started losing 
his hair in high school, but I couldn’t help picturing 
it happening all at once during the funeral, falling out
