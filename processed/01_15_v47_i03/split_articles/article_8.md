A
t an evening Mass at Saint Mary’s Church on Hill-
house Avenue, Father Joseph Allen stands at the 
pulpit and reads to his congregation from the Gos-
pel of Matthew. He reads the story of a miracle: as 
Jesus departed from the city of Jericho, two blind 
men stopped him on the road. These men knew him 
and begged that he cure their blindness. Jesus asked 
them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” “Yes, Lord,” 
they responded. Jesus touched their eyelids. “Let it be 
done according to your faith,” he told them. The men 
opened their eyes and began to see.

Father Allen pauses to look around at the parish-
ioners in the pews of New Haven’s oldest Catholic 
church. He takes a deep breath. “These men are grasp-
ing for anything in their hope for a cure,” he says. 
“They are at a point where nothing in their society 
can help. And so, it is their faith that saves them.” 
He closes the Bible and carries it down the pul-
pit steps, back to the altar, where he continues to cel-
ebrate the Mass. After Communion, the service con-
cludes with a familiar prayer. Though the text is in 
every parishioner’s pew-box, no one reads from the 
paper: they know the words by heart. They pray to 
God for the canonization of Father Michael McGivney, 
the parish priest who, some 130 years ago, devoted 
his life to the widows, orphans, and indigents of this 
very church. 

Father McGivney’s spirit may dwell in heaven, but 
his body is in their midst. Father McGivney’s remains 
lie at the back of the church, in a granite sarcoph-
agus that glows under a row of lights. The congre-
gants pray for Father McGivney’s help in delivering 
miracles. They all speak the same prayer, but hope for 
different things: some pray for a cure for illness, oth-
ers for a job to pay the bills or a loved one to return  
safely home. 

“We pray that God will grant the favor through 
the intercession of Father McGivney on behalf of us,” 
says Father Allen, a Dominican friar who has been a 
pastor of Saint Mary’s Church since 2007. “And it is 
certainly a lot of prayers storming heaven. For three 
years now, we have said the prayer at the end of each 
Mass, every day, and many of the parishioners say the 
prayer on their own.”

At this point, Father McGivney’s Cause for Saint-
hood—the process by which someone becomes a saint 
in the Roman Catholic Church—has been advancing 
for seventeen years. But it is a long and complicated 
road to sainthood. Now, Father McGivney’s advocates 
need to show that he has helped make miracles hap-
pen by interceding with God on behalf of the faithful. 
Authentic miracles, it turns out, are hard to prove.

In the late 1800s, when Roman Catholics often 
endured prejudice in the largely Protestant Northeast, 
Father McGivney devoted himself to New Haven’s 
Catholic community. In his time as a priest at Saint 
Mary’s Church, from 1877 to 1884, he visited the 
sick, tended to the dead and dying, and helped those 
who could not help themselves. 

John Walshe, Father McGivney’s 
grandnephew and a practicing 
lawyer in Bridgeport, says that 
stories of Father McGivney’s self-
less work have been passed down 
through his family. 

“He wasn’t the type to stay 
inside the church all day, and he 
wasn’t all ‘sackcloth and ashes,’” 
says Walshe. “When one of his parishioners was in 
need, Father Mike”—as the family affectionately calls 
Father McGivney—“wasn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves 
and get his hands dirty.”

Father McGivney was particularly concerned with 
New Haven’s Probate Court. The Court routinely sep-
arated widowed mothers from their children if the 
mother was unable to demonstrate her ability to sup-
port each child. Father McGivney had seen this hap-
pen many times, and throughout his career, he inter-
vened to assist widowed mothers in danger of losing 
their children. Once, he vowed to serve as a guardian 
for a young man about to be sent to an orphanage. 
But he could neither attend to every such case 
nor change the system singlehandedly. So, in Octo-
ber 1881, Father McGivney gathered several of his 
parishioners in the basement of Saint Mary’s Church, 
where he was then an assistant pastor. He explained 
to them his vision for a new organization of Catholic 
laymen, one that would provide insurance for Cath-
olic families. In the event of the death of a family’s 
breadwinner, this insurance would give the remaining 
family members the financial support needed to stay 
 together. This, Father McGivney hoped, would put 
an end to painful separations at the ruling of the  
Probate Court.

On March 29, 1882, he founded the Knights of 
Columbus to provide insurance to Catholic families. 
Within twenty years, the group’s membership had 
swelled to over 10,000, and its mission had expanded 
beyond insurance to include charitable work. Today, 
more than 1.8 million men across the world belong 
to the organization. Over the last ten years, they have 
contributed a total of nearly 700 million hours of  
volunteer service.

The organization has remained devoted to Father 
McGivney and his founding principles of charity and 
altruism. In 1997 the Knights of Columbus Supreme 
Council, headquartered in New Haven, petitioned the 
Hartford Archdiocese to start the 
process of canonization for Father 
McGivney. They asked then-Arch-
bishop of Hartford Daniel Cronin 
to initiate the first stages of Father 
McGivney’s case. He named Fa-
ther McGivney a Servant of God, 
formally beginning the Cause  
for Sainthood.

Only three people born in 
the United States have ever been made saints in the 
Roman Catholic Church. Two, Saints Elizabeth Seton 
and Katharine Drexel, founded religious orders dedi-
cated to educating the poor. They were canonized in 
1975 and 2000, respectively. The third, Saint Kateri 
Tekakwitha, was canonized in 2012, becoming the 
only Native American saint. Were Father McGivney to 
be elevated to sainthood, he would become the first 
American-born man ever canonized. 

Today, Father Allen says, the Church is looking 
for contemporary Catholics who could be canonized. 
“People we can align ourselves with, instead of some-
body who died in, say, 476, in which case you lose 
the connection with this place and time.” He explains 
that, by 1997, the Knights of Columbus were think-
ing, “We’ve put this off long enough. It’s time to be-
gin the Cause for Father McGivney.”

Every Cause needs an advocate, called a postulator, 
who builds the case for sainthood. The Knights chose 
Father Gabriel O’Donnell, a thoughtful, white-haired
