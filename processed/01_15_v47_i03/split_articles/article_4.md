“H
ow can the nation expect that the Republicans 
will solve the problem of the president not 
being able to drive the nation’s bus properly when 
they’re the ones who punctured the tires?” The voice 
coming from the stereo on the back of Reverend Ray 
Dubuque’s van lilts and breaks on “tires”—it sounds 
wise; a little paternal. Dubuque drives in circles, down 
College Street, right on Chapel, up High, and back 
around again. “That’s my voice you’re hearing,” he 
says. “I just recorded it this morning and burned it 
onto a CD. I’d use a mic, but I’m not sure how to rig 
it up in here.” 

So here he is, this friendly, red-sweatered man in 
his mid-seventies, driving the car that I’ve been trying 
to track down for weeks. You’ve probably seen him—
his tan sedan and trailer are now part of the afternoon 
landscape of downtown New Haven, looping around 
the Yale campus on clear weekday afternoons, blar-
ing Frank Sinatra and slow jams, plastered in slogans 
for websites called “LiberalsLikeChrist” and “Great-
Liberal-Insights.” In the past, Dubuque was a Catholic 
priest, then a Methodist minister; now, he is retired. 
He has run these websites since the late 1990s. The 
ones advertised on the van are the main sites, but a 
bit of clicking on large, grainy gray buttons will lead 
you to over 400 html pages—“JesusWouldBeFurious,” 
“theGodlessConservativeParty,” 
“ColumbusNoHero,” 
“MorePartisanshipPlease,” and “CatholicArrogance,” 
to name a few. Some of the pages are meticulously 
researched exposés on conservative corruption, some 
are detailed analyses of scripture, and some are plain 
rants. Full of blinking buttons and big, blue hyperlinks, 
with most of the text resting on a background motif 
of computer-generated linen, they seem to be a relic 
of the Web’s frontier days in the late nineties, bold but 
unsophisticated. Dubuque says all his pages serve a 
common goal: “I want liberals in America to wake up. 
Seventy percent of Americans identify as Christians. 
Instead of treating them as rivals, we should aggres-
sively persuade them to support the party that sup-
ports the ideas of Jesus Christ”—by which he means, 
of course, the Democrats.

www.liberalslikechrist.org/thegodlessconserva-
tiveparty.html: “Christian conservatives” have 
been using guilt by association for dec- 
ades to suggest that “liberal Christians” of [sic] 
being godless Marxists. Where is the evidence 
to support that charge?

Dubuque pulls over onto Hillhouse Avenue and 
waits for an opportunity to turn around. Some stu-
dents walk by as we wait for a green light. They look 
at the car for a few seconds, a little amused, then  
keep moving.

“Anyway,” Dubuque continues, following them 
with his eyes, “I’ve been wanting to advertise for 
years. I watch television all the time—MSNBC, and 
sometimes I go over to Fox to see what they’re up 
to—and I see that they’re spending millions of dollars 
on commercials. I don’t have that kind of money. So 
I bought this caravan this summer and hitched it to 
my car.”

I ask him why he wants to get the word out. Is 
there a Liberals Like Christ community? He tells me 
he has a Yahoo group moderated by one of his friends. 
It has just over five hundred members, and averages 
a few hundred posts per month. The forums are used 
for discussion, but Dubuque never tries to organize 
in-person events. “Organizing liberals is like herd-
ing cats,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of chiefs, but  
no Indians.” 

But never mind the organizing—Dubuque has a 
lot to say. The sun is setting as we round Chapel Street 
again, and the pink horizon illuminates one side of 
his face through the windshield. For a second he has 
the stoic and collected look of a world-weary vision-
ary. “You’re probably wondering what my definition 
of ‘liberal’ is,” he says slowly. “Now, by my definition, 
Stalin and Lenin were conservatives. Conservatives 
aren’t about conserving the past—that’s a huge mis-
take. They’re about conserving power for themselves. 
Us liberals, we’re about distributing wealth and power. 
We’re about equality.”

As he rattles off the hot-button issues, he says his 
websites give Christian liberals fodder for argument. 
On taxing the rich, according to Dubuque’s page 
“ChristvsChurch,” Jesus is pretty clear: “Anyone who 
wishes to be first in the kingdom of god should make 
himself the last and the servant of the rest” (Matthew 
20:26-28). Jesus doesn’t even mention homosexuality, 
or abortion, says Dubuque. “Of course, people on the 
Christian right will say, ‘But the Bible says, ‘Thou shalt 
not kill!’” Dubuque laughs a little. “And what’s that 
supposed to mean? The Bible doesn’t say thou shalt 
not kill a fetus anymore than it says thou shalt not kill 
a mosquito.” 

I ask him if he’s trying to use the sites to convert 
conservative Christians. “Those who really are conser-
vative have a lot to lose. I don’t expect to convert the 
Koch brothers. But the other ninety-nine percent, the 
non-wealthy conservative Christians, are just being 
lied to. If they really believe in the teachings of Jesus, 
hopefully I can convince them.” I ask him if he’s ever 
had any meaningful discourse with members of the 
Christian right. “Not really,” he admits. But he doesn’t 

I ASK HIM IF HE’S EVER 
HAD ANY MEANINGFUL 
DISCOURSE WITH MEMBERS 
OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT. 
“NOT REALLY...THERE’S NOT A 
LOT OF INTELLIGENCE 
IN THAT GROUP.”
