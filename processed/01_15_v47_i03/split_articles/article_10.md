NEW HAVEN’S PUNK 
SCENE LIVES ON IN THE 
BASEMENTS OF SOME ITS 
MOST DIE-HARD FANS

walked up the uneven stairs to the Panty 
House’s front porch on a Sunday night in 
November. A group of twenty-somethings 
with bull-ring nose piercings, shaggy beards 
and long, purple-streaked hair sat on the patio 
smoking. They nodded silently as I entered. 

Less than three miles from Yale’s campus, 
this “female house of punk,” as described by 
resident Kayla Bastos, was hosting a concert 
by New Haven band Mute Witness. Their front 
man, Ed Goodfriend, had warned me not to 
spread word about the show’s location too 
widely or publish the address. Doing so could 
attract police attention to the unofficial con-
cert venue and result in fines for those who 
live there. There was no entrance fee, but Chris 
Szczerba, a punk enthusiast who helps book 
shows for local bands, collected contributions 
in the living room. His black felt top hat was 
filled with crumpled singles. Inside the warm 
living room, a dozen people passed around 
steaming mugs of cider and a small black Lab-
rador retriever puppy.
