Dominican friar fluent in Italian. He holds a doctor-
ate from the Teresianum, an institute for the study 
of spirituality and theology in Rome. After his ap-
pointment, Father O’Donnell was required to attend 
classes at the Augustinianum, near the Vatican, with 
many other postulators. He was the only American in  
the program. 

After a year of rigorous study at the Augustinia-
num, Father O’Donnell received his certification from 
the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Vatican 
body that oversees the canonization process. He re-
turned to the United States prepared to take the reins 
of the Cause for the Sainthood of Father McGivney. Fa-
ther O’Donnell’s first responsibility as postulator was 
compiling the Acts: extensive historical records and 
documentation of Father McGivney’s life, as well as 
the priest’s own writings. 

To compile the Acts, Father O’Donnell worked 
with the Knights of Columbus archivist. “We spent 
the better part of a year going to the state archives 
in Hartford and going through all the microfiches of 
newspapers and journals to find all the references to 
Father McGivney we could,” he says. “We were able 
to piece together a lot of information about him, a 
whole chronology.” Father O’Donnell tracked down 
Father McGivney’s living relatives to find out more 
about their ancestor. He even traveled to County Ca-
van, Ireland, where Father McGivney’s parents had 
lived before they immigrated to America, to learn 
about the McGivney clan’s history.

O’Donnell’s work was academic, but he says it 
also affected him personally. “Over the course of my 
work,” says Father O’Donnell, “I came to know Father 
McGivney first as a historical figure and then, grad-
ually, as a spiritual ‘friend’ whom I came to admire 
and with whom I developed a personal connection. I 
sensed a kinship with Father McGivney that inspired 
me in my own life as a man and as a priest.”

After two years of research, Father O’Donnell had 
compiled 700 pages on Father McGivney’s life and 
work. In March of 2000, he presented these to Arch-
bishop Cronin at the Hartford Seminary in front of 
a huge audience made up mostly of members of the 
Knights of Columbus. With great ceremony, Archbish-
op Cronin tied the pages of the Acts with red string 
and sealed them with hot wax. This marked his Decree 
of Closure. The local diocesan process was over. The 
Roman process was about to begin.

What seems like a normal suitcase could, in the hands 
of a priest, contain the fate of a possible saint. It was 
now Father O’Donnell’s job to carry the Acts safely to 
the Vatican and deliver them to the Congregation for 
the Causes of Saints. He packed the documents into 
two suitcases and boarded his flight to Rome, wheel-
ing his luggage onto the plane, unwilling to check his 
precious cargo. 

A driver met Father O’Donnell at the airport out-
side of Rome and drove him to the Congregation. 
After arriving at the Palazzo delle Congregazioni, Fa-
ther O’Donnell lugged the suitcases into the build-
ing. “Thank God for the elevator,” he thought, “I don’t 
know if I could drag these up the stairs.” He presented 
the Acts to members of the Congregation, who broke 
the seals, verified that all was in order, and gave the 
Roman process the go-ahead. 

Father O’Donnell spent most of the next two years 
in Rome, as per Congregation rules, writing the Po-
sitio, a volume of biographical information from the 
Acts as well as an examination of Father McGivney’s 
virtue and spirituality. He submitted the completed 
Positio, which was over one thousand pages long, to 
the Congregation in 2002.

Six years later, Father O’Donnell’s efforts on behalf of 
the Cause finally bore fruit: in 2008, the Congrega-
tion for the Causes of Saints approved the Positio and 
recommended that Pope Benedict XVI declare Father 
McGivney Venerable, a decree that officially recog-
nizes a candidate’s heroic virtue. On March 16, 2008 
Pope Benedict XVI declared Father McGivney Vener-
able. There are currently only forty-nine ‘Venerables’ 
awaiting the next steps toward full sainthood. 

Because the Pope issued his decree from the Vati-
can while most of America slept, Father Allen in New 
Haven had not yet heard the news when he awoke 
that morning. It was Palm Sunday, the day that begins 
the Western Christian holy week leading up to Easter. 
He was in the sacristy—a small chamber where the 
priest prepares for a service—at Saint Mary’s, getting 
ready to celebrate the Palm Sunday Mass, when the 
parish secretary told him that a group of journalists 
had gathered outside the church. 

“I asked if they could come back after the Mass,” 
Father Allen recalls, “but they said it couldn’t wait.”

After that Palm Sunday, Father McGivney’s Cause 
faced its greatest challenge yet: proving that God had 
worked miracles through the late priest.

How do you prove a miracle?  The Holy See de-
fines a miracle as some event that has no scientific or 
non-divine explanation. They must agree that God has 
performed a miracle in response to Father McGivney’s 
prayers. After one miracle has been authenticated, Fa-
ther McGivney would be declared Blessed; the next, 
and final stage—canonization—would occur when a 
second miracle is confirmed. But, if miracles attribut-
ed to a candidate for sainthood cannot be proved au-
thentic, the years of work and thousands of pages of 
writing devoted to his Cause could come to nothing.


Hundreds of people have written to the Knights of 
Columbus because they believe Father McGivney in-
terceded in curing their illnesses. Many of the congre-
gants at Saint Mary’s have come to Father Allen report-
ing miracles they attribute to Father McGivney’s aid. 
Yet few of these instances come close to qualifying as 
genuine miracles in the view of the Congregation for 
the Causes of Saints. 

Take, for example, the case of John Walshe, Fa-
ther McGivney’s grandnephew. In 2009, Walshe went 
to Bridgeport Hospital for routine tests after a bout 
of pneumonia. The tests came back showing an ex-
ceptionally high white blood cell count. He was di-
agnosed with aggressive prostate cancer and told he 
would need surgery. 

Several weeks before the operation, Walshe took 
his 16-year-old son aside for a conversation about Fa-
ther Mike. He told his son that he had been saying 
the intercessory prayer to Father McGivney and asked 
him to do the same on his behalf. From that point 
on, until the day of surgery, father and son prayed to 
Father McGivney for a cure. Following the five-hour 
prostatectomy, John Walshe awoke to find the surgeon 
at his bedside, grinning widely. 

“We got it all,” the doctor said.

Today, Walshe remains cancer-free. He believes 
that Father McGivney’s intercession on his behalf was 
at least partly responsible for his cure. But, like many 
others with similar stories, his case does not officially 
qualify as a miracle. After all, who knows if it was 
Father McGivney’s intercession or the surgeon’s skill 
that saved Walshe’s life?

Father Allen, the pastor at Saint Mary’s Church, 
is also a cancer survivor. He, too, believes that con-
stant prayers to Father McGivney were responsible for 
his cure. But hivs melanoma did not vanish without 
explanation—a surgeon removed it in the operating 
room. Neither Father Allen nor Walshe challenge the 
Vatican’s process for determining what is miraculous 
and what isn’t, but both wish that the issue were not 
so black and white. 

“I have given it a lot of thought each day, and 
I believe that my cancer did not go beyond what it 
was precisely because of my devotion to Father Mc-
Givney,” says Father Allen. “A miracle must be instan-
taneous, inexplicable, no medical intervention, and 
so forth. Well, all that is true. But maybe the doctor’s 
knowledge, and his hands, were part of the miracle.” 

However, Father Allen understands the Catholic 
Church’s hesitancy in claiming divine intervention 
in cases where the “miracle” could be attributed to 
medical treatment. In as delicate a matter as miracles, 
which many treat with suspicion anyway, the Church’s 
reputation is at stake.

“The Church could expose itself to ridicule by 
making statements that it must later retract,” he says, 
“should the miracle be disproven [after sainthood is 
granted].” 

In 2000, while working in Rome on the Positio for 
Father McGivney, Father O’Donnell identified an event 
from the 1990s that he thought fulfilled the Vatican’s 
criteria. He helped to prepare a separate Positio for 
the event. (Due to confidentiality rules surrounding 
rejected miracles, he cannot give more details about  
the case.)

“The Positio for a reported miracle,” says Father 
O’Donnell, “includes not only the account of the re-
ported miracle but also all of the medical documents 
involved—every X-ray, every blood test, all of the doc-
tors’ and nurses’ notes. All of that must go into the 
Positio to demonstrate that medical solutions were 
attempted, and failed.” But he explains that “in the 
case of the reported miracle I submitted for Father 
McGivney’s Cause, science did everything it could but 
it didn’t work. It was inexplicable what happened, and 
I felt there was clear evidence of the Digitus Dei, the 
Finger of God.”

The reported miracle passed preliminary vetting 
by a committee of canon lawyers, who ensure that the 
Positio’s account of the event is factual and in keep-
ing with the protocols of the Catholic Church. The 
Positio then moved to the consideration of a board 
of physicians, called the Consulta Medica or the Col-
lege of Doctors. At least nine doctors review each re-
ported miracle. In order for a miracle to gain approval, 
they must rule out any medical explanation for the  
reported event. 

In 2011, after years of deliberation, the medi-
cal committee rejected the reported miracle Father 
O’Donnell submitted for Father McGivney. Without 
revealing anything confidential, Father O’Donnell 
explained why he felt the miracle had not “passed 
muster.” The College of Doctors found that the medi-
cal record for the subject of the reported miracle was 
incomplete, as the hospital where the patient had un-
dergone treatment and testing had not retained all of 
the patient’s X-rays from the relevant time period.

“Because of our advances in science and technol-
ogy, the bar has been raised considerably for prov-
ing a miracle,” say Father O’Donnell. “What two cen-
turies ago you might have been able to ‘prove’ was 
miraculous healing, today would require a lot more 
scientific investigation and documentation. But this 
also means there is greater security that the authen-
ticated event is actually miraculous. The Holy See will 
only accept as miraculous something that truly has no  
other explanation.”

After the 2011 rejection of the first reported miracle, 
a new postulator, Andrea Ambrosi, prepared the Posi-
tio for a second. (Father O’Donnell had since stepped 
down from his role as postulator and now heads the 
Knight of Columbus organization’s Father McGivney 
Guild.) Vice-Postulator for the Cause Brian Caul-
field, who works at the Knights of Columbus head-
quarters in New Haven, is hopeful that the reported 
miracle will soon move to the College of Doctors for  
medical review.

“If anything it gives me confidence in the integ-
rity of the process that it is so strict,” he says. “We 
would all like to see Father McGivney beatified as 
soon as possible, but there is a great amount of careful 
examination needed in these cases.”

Father McGivney is a long way from official saint-
hood. Even if the Pope beatifies him, it will require 
another authenticated miracle to move from Blessed 
to Saint. Still, Father McGivney’s supporters remain 
hopeful. The Catholic Church has struggled in re-
cent decades to maintain its strength—especially in 
the United States. Sex-abuse scandals have called the 
Church’s moral authority into question and tarnished 
much of America’s view of the priesthood. Morale 
amongst priests has dwindled, along with their num-
bers. Every advancement of Father McGivney, a priest 
himself—“one of their own,” as Father Allen says—
toward sainthood is a source of pride and inspiration 
for the American clergy. 

“The Cause,” says Father O’Donnell, “is good in-
strument to give a more positive face to the priests 
and improve their perception in the world.”

One afternoon, while sitting at his desk in the priory, 
Father Allen explains that “[Father McGivney] could 
be beatified very soon. It might even happen when 
Pope Francis visits the United States next September, 
but of course we don’t know for sure. As for Father 
McGivney’s sainthood, well, when that happens we’ll 
be more prepared than anyone.”

He rises from his chair and walks to the shelves 
in the corner of his office. He pulls out several lami-
nated blueprints, his architectural plans for the long-
awaited day when Father McGivney may be canon-
ized. Father Allen has plans to move Father McGivney’s 
marble sarcophagus to the front of the church, where 
the altar now stands, so that the congregation that is 
devoted to their former parish priest can view their 
patron saint’s memorial in full splendor. 

Father Allen has the new lighting plan all figured 
out, down to the last bulb. He has even started to 
calculate how much it will cost to install more bath-
rooms—after all, he will need to accommodate the 
crowds he anticipates will flock to Saint Mary’s to visit 
the resting place of Saint Michael McGivney.

Still, Father Allen says, there is no need to wait for 
an official decree of sainthood to honor Father Mc-
Givney’s spiritual inspiration and legacy. 

“Whether by divine providence Father McGivney 
is raised to Blessed or is canonized in itself is very 
important,” says Father Allen, “but our work does not 
depend upon that.”

As Father Allen told his congregation, Jesus alone 
could not grant sight to the two blind men of Jeri-
cho. It took their faith to bring the miracle. Father 
McGivney’s greatest power, then, may not be miracles 
worked from the grave, but the fervor he inspires in 
the believers at Saint Mary’s Church as they honor him 
in their daily prayers.
