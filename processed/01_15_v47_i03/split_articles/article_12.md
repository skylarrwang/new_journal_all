So that’s why we’ve done so much to 
put the president in new media envi-
ronments, like Google Hangouts and 
Twitter interviews and getting young 
people to enroll with the Affordable 
Care Act through Between Two 
Ferns, which obviously I know 
is not a real interview, but it was 
a way to reach people and it was 
very effective. 

Not everything we did worked, some 
of it was a little awkward, but by and 
large it was pretty successful. You have to 
be cautious and conservative when you’re deal-
ing with how the president interacts with the me-
dia, but I’m sure there will be things you and I 
can’t even dream of that presidents will be doing in  
ten years.

After graduating from Yale, you worked for the 
Miami Herald and Time magazine. If you were 
graduating this spring with an interest in journal-
ism, what would you be doing?

The economics of it are extremely challenging, up 
and down, from the starting reporter and writer to 
the publisher of any publication. But I think that the 
universe is settling a little bit, and when you look at 
the strength of The New York Times and the Wall 
Street Journal—and the Washington Post is actu-
ally on a rebound—there’s hopefully longevity there 
and they actually have digital strategies as well. 

The most exciting place right now in terms of the 
written word is in the startup universe—not the 
digitization of old media, but publications that have 
started online. Vox.com comes to mind as one that 
is just, I think, excellent. It provides extremely high 
quality reporting and writing. It provides a real public 
service with its approach to explanatory journalism. 
I might gravitate in that direction. In the end, if you 
can get the economics right, there’s always going to 
be a place for long-form magazine journalism, at least 
I hope.

L
ast summer, The Onion published a fake op-ed 
under your byline titled “Well, Time To Go Out 
In Front Of A Bunch Of People And Lie To Them.” 
What do you make of this idea that you and other 
press secretaries are really just in the business  
of deception?

One of the things people ask me, having left the White 
House after five years, three and a half as press secre-
tary, is, don’t you feel liberated now? I felt liberated 
when I went. I wasn’t an advocate, I didn’t take sides 
as a reporter in elections or align with a party or even 
an ideology. Having the opportunity, as I did, to go to 
the White House and work for a president and vice 
president that I believe in and a series of policy initia-
tives that I dealt with and to talk about them was actu-
ally very liberating. That’s my view. And I think it’s a 
little simplistic to say that because you’re representing 
the president and the administration and the country 
that you’re somehow being untruthful.


One allegation often levied against the Obama 
administration is its excessive use of the Es-
pionage Act of 1917 to go after whistleblow-
ers. Is it at odds with Obama’s promises of  
increased transparency?

For the people who say blindly that this administra-
tion is an enemy of the free press, it’s just ridiculous. 
It very strongly supports shield laws and has pushed 
Congress on that. The new standards are the best there 
have ever been. The fact of the matter is that you have 
a convergence of existing cases that were started un-
der the Bush administration and technologies that are 
so different now. When there are national security 
leaks, it’s serious. There are consequences, they can be 
sometimes extremely damaging.

I’m curious to hear about your switching sides, so 
to speak, from journalist to press secretary. You 
told The New York Times, “If I had known then 
what I know now, I would have suc-
cumbed less often to chasing the 
same soccer ball down the field that 
everybody else was.” Do you think 
the press often succumbs to a herd 
mentality?

In Washington, every issue or challenge 
or problem or obstacle is a sensation 
or scandal. When that happens, there is 
a starting gun that goes off and people 
chase the story. And sometimes when you 
get a mass of high-profile reporters from the 
most prominent news organizations chasing 
the same story, it suggests a legitimacy to the underlying 
story that may not be there. Sometimes it is. Obviously 
there is a lot of important stuff that happens, a lot of bad 
things have happened in government and policy. But I 
think there is a lot of hyperventilating, and things turn 
out to be a lot less important than the reporting at the  
time suggested.

The instinct is correct to hold power accountable. That 
instinct needs to be nurtured, but there need to be edi-
tors and others around who have the perspective to 
know when a story is Watergate or not. Everything be-
comes “the worst thing since….” There’s only going 
to be one Katrina. There’s only going to be one Water-
gate. There’s an effort to hype every story beyond what 
the facts can bear. And I don’t think it’s a conspiracy, 
I just think it’s a function of the way the press works  
in Washington.

The administration went out of its way to give 
interviews to and to take questions at press con-
ferences from new media ventures like the Huff-
ington Post. Where do you think the president a 
generation from now will be giving interviews to? 
When I was at the White House, you still always had 
to find your audience. It’s just a lot more complicated 
now than it was under Reagan and Bush and even to 
some degree Clinton. For this president and his suc-
cessor, it will just be more of a challenge. If he gives a 
major speech in the afternoon, it’s almost a guarantee 
that no one will even know it happened. It’s no longer 
likely even that network news will cover it. If they do, 
their audiences have shrunk dramatically. 

Jay Carney ’87, a former managing editor of the 
New Journal, served as the 29th White House 
press secretary until his resignation this past 
May. He is now working as a commentator for 
CNN. He spoke with TNJ about politics, media, 
and whether or not The Onion has it right.
