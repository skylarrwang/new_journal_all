**Title: essay on roadside shrines and being far from home**

I’m in Mumbai when Samantha dies, and Siem 
Reap when I find out. I see it on Facebook, which 
is how I always learn that an acquaintance has died. 
It’s 5:00 a.m., and my circadian rhythms are upside 
down. The air beyond my hotel room window is 
warm and soggy, and it’s fogging up the glass. The 
air-conditioning on my face feels like it would be 
chlorine-blue if I could see it. The room smells like 
perfume and bleach fumes. I’ve promised myself that 
I won’t use my laptop first thing in the morning, but 
it’s my only connection with home and I wake up 
reaching for it.

The first thing I notice is that there are cryptic 
little notes sprinkled through my news feed.

Cassandra: Goodmorning @Sam. <3 <3 <3 Think-
ing of you this morning. I still don’t believe it.

The posts are all tagged like that: @Sam, her name 
lit up in a luminous blue. Second, I notice the jokes.

Jake: I swear you must have demanded them to 
bring chicken fries back when you got up there lmao 
I saw the commercial today and instantly thought 
“Damm Sam would flip shit!” Lmao miss you boo. 

Third, I notice the comments choking with  
earnestness.

Monte: i just don’t know what to say its just so un-
real that another one of my friends have left this 
earth. I’m gonna miss all the random times Sam 
would just show up at my house and just take me 
on one of her random adventures.Through thick 
and thin i always knew that she would be there. 
As she would always say to me “ i got your back 
kid” Truly an angel love you sammy. - @Sam

Fourth, I see photos, like a slideshow at a wake.
