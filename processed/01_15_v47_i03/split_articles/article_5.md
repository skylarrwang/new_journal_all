T
he Yale men’s soccer team won only one of its 
seventeen games this season. Midway through 
the fall, physical training had not led to considerable 
improvement on the field. The coaches hoped to find 
another way to give their team an edge. They talked 
one-on-one with the players, learning what made 
each man tick; they even administered personality 
tests. They were not looking for information about 
the players’ observable performances. They were in-
terested in improving the team’s mental game. De-spite months of training, they psyched themselves out 
on the field. So the coaches offered a few players an 
unusual opportunity: hypnotherapy.

Ryan Simpson, a sophomore athlete, was one of 
three teammates who took the coaches up on their of-
fer, and the only one to agree to an interview. The tall, 
bright blond goalie had dated one of my suitemates, 
so he was especially candid with me. On the soccer 
field, Ryan often struggled to keep his mind under 
control. He was jittery and nervous. He reacted slow-
ly, and didn’t jump high enough or dive far enough 
to make saves. Off the field, he kept his frustrations 
bottled up until they began to manifest in insomnia, 
anxiety, or the cathartic breaking of furniture. Despite 
these problems, he didn’t initially embrace the idea  
of hypnotherapy. 

“I went in thinking, ‘This is going to be silly,’’’ 
Ryan said. He agreed to hypnotherapy partly out of 
a sense of obligation: the hypnotherapist, Leanne 
Peterson, is also the fiancé of the team’s assistant 
coach, Hiro Suzuki. (Suzuki and Brian Tompkins, the 
recently retired head coach, could not be reached  
for comment.) 

“I never thought it would work,” Ryan continued, 
“but I am so happy to say I was one hundred percent 
wrong…It helped me attempt to figure out me.” 

I wanted to believe Ryan when he talked about 
the radical change in his perspective, so Ryan and Pe-
terson allowed me to come along to their second ap-
pointment. So I suppressed my doubts and went to 
experience hypnosis for myself. 

Hypnosis has long been a pop-
ular as an on-stage entertain-
ment stunt. As a result, hypno-
therapy has struggled to assert 
itself as medically sound. It can 
be hard to find unbiased infor-
mation about the effectiveness 
of the practice, since most of 
the testimonies are from prac-
ticing hypnotherapists. The few 
scientific studies that do exist look into two dozen 
participants at most. For example, a 2000 study pub-
lished in the academic journal Perceptual and Motor 
Skills observed that “hypnosis may positively control 
emotions, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions,” but 
the two researchers, sports psychologists at the Uni-
versity of Sheffield Hallam, based their claim on the 
experiences of a single “elite senior European tour 
golfer.” Other studies, which look at hypnotherapy pa-
tients’ cerebral blood flow or athletic performance, are  
similarly questionable.


The many hypnotherapy services, however, 
promise success rates that science cannot. There are 
over a dozen such centers in the greater New Haven 
area, many of which practice sports hypnotherapy 
and count Yale athletes among their clients. One is the 
Amadeus Center for Health & Healing, which is lo-
cated just two blocks from the university’s campus. 
Mindful Warriors, based out of Lakeville, Connecti-
cut, offers testimonials on its website from Yale varsity 
golfers as well as volleyball, football, and field hockey 
players, all praising the therapist’s ability to help them 
relax and learn about themselves. So, the soccer team’s 
embrace of hypnotherapy isn’t entirely new.


The NCAA publication Mind, Body, and Sport, 
calls sports psychologists “an ideal resource to pro-
vide care and services,” but warns against “motiva-
tional gurus” and “mental coaches,” who can find 
“college athletics a prime target for their services, 
and they may very well ignore, minimize or neglect 
the real issues of psychological health.” Still, Matthew 
Stults-Kolehmainen, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist 
and researcher at the Yale Stress Center and Columbia 
University told me that he believes the therapy might 
have some merit. Though he wouldn’t personally 
prescribe hypnotherapy, “the literature does report 
some evidence of efficacy for 
some performance-related out-
comes,” he said. 


Hypnotherapy’s reputation 
often affects clients’ expecta-
tions. Peterson, the hypnother-
apist, noted that clients often 
come in either overly skepti-
cal, which prevents them from 
feeling any effects, or overly 
excited, believing her to be a 
psychic. 


A licensed clinical social 
worker, Peterson practiced traditional talk therapy for 
two years before acquiring her hypnotherapy license 
in 2013. With hypnotherapy, however, she says she 
sees results much more quickly. In her experience, 
the treatment can address issues as varied as academic 
underachievement, grief, and depression in only four 
sessions. One patient’s anxiety seemed to decrease by 
half after just one meeting. As Peterson put it, she’d 
“never seen results like that in traditional therapy.”


When Ryan and I met to walk to our hypnotherapy 
session, I expected him to guide us to a clinic or office 
building. Instead, we turned toward a nearby apart-
ment building. Peterson has a New Haven office for 
her business, meditation, yoga, and therapy center 
called Elevate, but she sometimes holds informal ses-
sions at home.


A small woman with shining brown hair, Peter-
son was poised and professional. She asked us to re-
move our shoes in the entryway before guiding us 
to the living room, lit warmly with star-shaped lan-
terns. There, Ryan and I each lay on a wing of her  
L-shaped couch. 


Our session, like each session Peterson adminis-
ters, began with a conversation about what hypno-
therapy is and what we wanted to address. Peterson 
played a mellow instrumental track on her laptop, as 
she turned down the lights and began to speak slowly 
and softly.

“Imagine a ball of energy starting at your toes,” 
she began. We envisioned it rolling from our toes 
to our feet, up our legs and throughout our bodies. 
“Imagine your body melting away,” she continued, 
and we systematically let the consciousness of our 
limbs float away, arm, arm, leg, leg. 

Worried I wasn’t fully experiencing the hypnosis, 
I analyzed my experience as it occurred. What would 
happen, I wondered, if I moved my arm? Would it 
break the spell? But even as I considered it my limbs 
felt heavy, locked in place, as if asleep. I could move 
my arm, I thought. But why bother? This was the 
hypnosis, I decided—or, at least, the manifestation of 
my desire not to sabotage my own experience. Later, 
I asked Peterson why, instead of losing consciousness 
completely, I felt half-awake throughout the session—
aware of my body and my senses but unable or un-
willing to move. She reassured me that my experience 
was a common one, explaining that people tend to 
expect hypnosis to feel utterly new, when in reality 
it is more like an extended state of relaxation, similar  
to meditation. 

Continuing the hypnotherapy, Peterson instructed 
us to mentally walk down a staircase to a meadow. 
From there, she told us to walk along an outdoor 
path, following the sun. In my mind I followed the 
sun along a California hillside, which transformed 
into a tree-lined trail as my thoughts increasingly gov-
erned by dream logic.  

“Follow the path and don’t worry about your fu-
ture,” Peterson directed us. “The future is your path 
and the sun will guide you.” From the path we were 
directed to a movie theater, where we were instructed 
to watch ourselves succeeding on the screen. In my 
black-and-white mental movie, I was taking tests, 
writing papers, completely calm throughout.  

“Picture yourself during finals succeeding. Say to 
yourself, ‘I am enough. I am enough,’” she instructed. 
“Say, ‘I am relaxed and peaceful. I release stress.’” 

We hovered there for a moment, watching our 
imaginary futures on our imaginary screens, before 
Peterson walked us backwards out of the hypnosis: 
we traveled down the path again, up the stairs, and 
then, on a count of three, became aware of our bodies 
and our faces, and finally opened our eyes. Ryan woke 
as if from a deep sleep, unable to remember half of  
the session.


Although an inch-long tear in his quadriceps pre-
vented Ryan from completing the soccer season, he 
did play one post-hypnotherapy game on his injured 
leg. It was the Harvard-Yale soccer game. Normally 
antsy and unfocused, Ryan remembers feeling calm 
and relaxed. During the game, instead of letting his 
doubts get the better of him, he told me he was able 
to trust himself. The mental shift translated into bet-
ter performance. He made smarter decisions and felt 
more confident, which helped him block more shots.


It’s impossible to know how much of this can 
be attributed to the hypnotherapy, but Ryan credits 
the treatment for his improvements. He recalled how, 
during his first session, Peterson asked him to visual-
ize two abstract struggles: first, climbing a mountain 
until he reached what he described as “his vision of 
success”; and then plunging “underwater and feeling 
crushed by the weight of everything,” until he swam 
to the surface. Ryan said hypnotherapy allowed him 
to switch his perspective from a glass half empty to a 
glass half full.


Yet, Ryan had wanted to be calmer and more pres-
ent, so hypnotherapy may have acted as a catalyst for 
a mental shift he had already been reaching towards. 
Changes he attributed to hypnotherapy might have 
occurred simply through force of will. Maybe even 
the opportunity to pause and reflect improved his 
play. “The purpose [of hypnotherapy]  is to remind 
you of what makes you succeed and what causes you 
to fail,” Ryan said. 


I had seen Ryan’s transformation, and I wanted 
hypnotherapy to work for me. A few days later, I found 
myself in the library quietly chanting, “I am enough. 
I am enough.” But it was hard, during the academic 
crush of early December, to know if the calmness I 
was feeling was a result of a subconscious suggestion 
or a sign of emotional burnout. I think I’ve been bet-
ter able to deal with stress, but I don’t know if it’s pos-
sible to say that hypnotherapy changed me. It might 
have simply been, as Ryan kept suggesting, a reminder 
to pay more attention to myself.


Who knows—maybe the secret to athletic suc-
cess is not daily workouts, lifting weights, or run-
ning drills. Maybe the secret is lying in a darkened 
room, conjuring up mental mirages, your limbs  
perfectly still.
