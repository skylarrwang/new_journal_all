into the (connecticut) woods
B
efore we crossed the gate into Hamden’s West 
Rock Ridge State Park, Michael Richardson pulled 
a bottle of mosquito repellent from a backpack stuffed 
with hiking supplies. “I have two separate infections 
of Lyme disease, so I make a point of bringing the 
bug spray every time I come out,” he explained to me 
as we stood near the park’s entrance. “It’s just one of 
those things you have to deal with, I guess.” 

Richardson knows nature, ticks and otherwise: 
he has spent the past four years compiling a compre-
hensive guide to native species 
of plants and animals across the 
state. In 2010, the 37-year-old 
Connecticut native founded 
the educational website Con-
necticutWilderness.com; today, 
the website features nearly 900 
creatures, from Sphyrapicus 
varius, the yellow-bellied sap-
sucker, to Notophthalmus viri-
descens, the Eastern newt.

Even on this sunny Saturday 
morning in September, when 
people in hiking boots and ca-
noes dot the sunlit Connecticut landscape, Richardson 
said his thoughts often turn toward darker visions. 
“Every time I’m out, I’m always sort of thinking from 
a survivalist standpoint,” he said as we headed down 
the trail. “You have to think about it in terms of what 
would happen if there was a zombie apocalypse or a 
nuclear bomb went off.” 

Richardson knows this eschatological vision—
the undead swarming the parking lot, the woman on 
the red canoe paddling through hellfire—is improb-
able. Unlike so-called “doomsday preppers” obsessed 
with the apocalypse, Richardson is ruled by a more 
practical motivation: he’s simply fascinated by how 
nature abounds with resources for survival. His ex-
treme thought experiment—and the attention to de-
tail it requires—has afforded him a near-encyclopedic 
knowledge of the Connecticut species he now cata-
logs online. The man behind ConnecticutWilderness.
com is part Bear Grylls, part botany teacher—and de-
termined to get his visitors to rethink their relation-
ship with nature.

Richardson discovered his love for the wilder-
ness as a teenager, tucked away at summer camp in 
the New Hampshire woods. There, from the camp’s 
counselors, he learned about vegetables that came 
from the ground, not the gro-
cery store: wild plants that you 
could pluck straight from the 
dirt and eat. The first he tried 
was a slender white root called 
Indian cucumber. With just 
one bite, he was hooked. “I 
knew you could pick blackber-
ries and blueberries and all that 
stuff, but the Indian cucum-
ber, that was cool,” Richard-
son said. Later that summer, he 
decided to draft an exhaustive 
map of the campground’s ed-
ible plants, a feat for which he won Camp Pasquaney’s 
nature award. “That was sort of the first iteration of 
Connecticut Wilderness,” he said.

He built the current version of the website about 
four years ago to share his knowledge. By day he is 
an IT professional, and the project has offered him an 
opportunity to learn additional computing languages 
and skills. Richardson uses everything from vinyl re-
cords of birdcalls to Wikipedia to guide his work. 
“The best way to get proficient is to spend a lot of 
time studying,” he said. “You have to be really careful 
and know what you’re looking for.” To illustrate his 
point, Richardson motioned me over to a cluster of 
black and yellow insects, buzzing menacingly around 
a clump of purple blooms.

“Come down low on these guys,” he said, squatting 
down with his camera. He let one of the fuzzy critters 
climb his finger. “That’s a syrphid fly,” he said. “They 
look like bees. They’re mimics.” But unlike bees, 
they’re harmless. Syrphid flies’ resemblance to a more 
dangerous doppelganger helps them ward off preda-
tors—plus freak out inexperienced hikers like me. 
But those familiar with the wilderness, my guide 
included, have an easier time than predators at rec-
ognizing the many mimics that live in Connecticut. 
Richardson cites another common local example: two 
plants, mountain laurel and wintergreen. The former 
is poisonous, while the latter lends a minty taste to 
chewing gum. But both have red stems and blue-
green leaves. When we found a plant that fit that de-
scription, Richardson used a pocketknife to slice off 
a portion, then plucked off its leaves, tore them in 
half, and gave the fragments a sniff. Pressing the leaf 
fragments to his mouth, he took a taste to confirm his  
identification: wintergreen.

Richardson rarely checks the analytics that would 
tell him how many people have visited his website. 
Just 51 Facebook users, including myself, “like” the 
website’s fan page. Still, it’s important to him that the 
website expand, both online and off. He hopes to 
develop a mobile version of his site, and he recently 
hosted a mycology walk under the ConnecticutWil-
derness.com banner attended by a dozen people eager 
to learn to identify wild mushrooms. 

In Connecticut, a state better known for its coun-
try clubs than its national parks, the challenge isn’t 
taming the wilderness, but finding it. Here, foraging 
for wild edibles is a hobby, not a matter of sustenance. 
“You’re never really going to be anywhere in Con-
necticut where you can’t get rescued,” Richardson 
said. “Even in the deepest of forests, you really can’t 
get more than five to ten miles away from a road at 
the most.” But even a short distance from the pristine 
lawns of suburbia, he can point at nearly any plant and 
tell you whether you can eat it.

On our hike, Richardson identified dozens of 
other species that can sustain hungry foragers, from 
sheep sorrel, a lemony herb that goes well in salad, 
to common mullein, a fuzzy-leaved plant that grows 
close to the ground and is said to have medicinal ef-
fects. Some plants have multiple uses, too: take mul-
lein, for example. “Its best use is as toilet paper in the 
woods,” Richardson said. “It works.” While you may 
never find yourself wiping with a leaf, the point has 
been made: there’s an abundance of treasures in the 
forest, if only you learn to find them.
