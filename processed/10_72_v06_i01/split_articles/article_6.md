THE DAHL REPORT WAS NOT THE FIRST 
by Vicki C. Jackson 
Of the ten und~rgraduates present 
at a recent meeting of a residential 
college education committee, five 
were freshmen coerced into attend-
ing by their counselors. Discussion 
was strained. When the college 
Master asked, '·'What would you 
like to learn that you cannot learn 
at Yale right now?" the freshmen 
as well as most of the upper-
classmen had nothing to say. They 
were surprisingly incapable of 
dealing with a faculty member's 
suggestion that the broad politic.al 
and educational implications of 
the college seminar program be 
considered. 
Four years ago, at the inception 
of the Hall seminar program, such 
a display of disinterest would have 
been inconceivable. Student 
impatience with the subjects, 
methods, and processes of education 
at Yale complemented and drew 
strength from their anger and 
involvement with national political 
events. 
But, earlier in the sixties, the 
world had been less turbulent, and 
Yale students had been less 
critical of their university. Educa-
tional decision-making was the do-
main of faculty committees which 
at most informally consulted 
student leaders. Curricular and 
programmatic changes added to 
the standard Yale program numerous 
"options," open to a select few, 
but genuine alternatives--courses of 
learning significantly diverse yet 
equally accessible and legitimate--
were practically nonexistent. 
Student desires for new learning 
situations, and doubts as to the 
concept of degree requirements, 
gave the word "alternative" an 
increasingly positive connotation. 
Enthusiasm and critical thinking 
ran high; clarity of meaning 
suffered. For some, the cry for 
alternative meant that present 
educational, political, and social 
situations were so awful that any 
change represented a positive 
alternative. For others, the new 
alternative meant a new system of 
education based on different 
assumptions. And for some, 
"alternative" was in itself a system: 
education at Yale should consist 
of several equally legitimate and 
unique courses of learning available 
on a non-preferential basis to all 
students. 
Student participation in 
University: governance became 
linked, emotionally if not logic-
ally, to the rising theme of the 
new alternative. The exclusion of 
affected parties from the formal 
decision-making proces~, students 
argued, led to failures and inade-
quacies in Yale's education. The 
addition of the term "participation" 
completed the paradigm of 
reform, and participation, like 
alternative, lost its neutral meaning. 
The emphasis placed on the positive 
nature and impact of alternatives 
and participation created an 
atmosphere which lasted from the 
mid-60's to 1970 and in which 
numerous, substantive changes 
occurred in Yale education. 
Historically, two circumstances 
set the tone and parameters of 
educational reform at Yale. First, 
there has always been and still 
remains a distinctive Yale education 
whose very boundaries are suggested 
by the optional and exclusive nature 
of the special programs available. 
Second, for most of Yale's history, 
the faculty has both formulated and 
initiated educational philosophy and 
change. Between 1884 and 1945, 
with much tinkering and swinging to 
extremes, the faculty evolved the 
three-part concept of a liberal arts 
education that prevailed unchanged 
until the 1960's and that even today 
is the basis of the standard Yale 
education. 
Professor William Graham Sumner 
led the battle which resulted in Yale's 
reluctant surrender of a system of 
totally required course selection. 
Beginning in 1884, Y alies could elect 
some of their courses, although group 
requirements were retained to 
prevent "utter chaos." Creation of 
the separate departments of study in 
the Reorganization fo 1919 lay the 
ground for the requirement of the 
t:iK<dergraduate major, formalized by 
the faculty in the early 1930's. By 
the end of the following decade 
the Course of Study Committee spoke 
for the faculty in describing the 
liberal arts education as a balance 
between breadth, concentration, and 
election. 
In 1952 the national media hailed 
the Yale College faculty Report on 
General Education for its "revolution-
ary" British approach to American 
higher education. In seeking to 
increase the intellectual content of 
education and foster greater student 
independence, the report recommended 
a two-year period of guided indepen-
dent work with neither classes exams 
nor grades. This proposal thre~tened ' 
to undermine the departmental auth-
ority and vitiate the power and 
control that the faculty exercised in 
specific courses. The proposal died 
in committee. 
Ten years later, a faculty committee, 
appointed by the President to 
reevaluate the Common Freshman year 
program then in effect envisioned an 
innovative but less fundamental 
remaking of Yale. Nearly all their 
proposals were adopted and the 
freshmen, physically isolated by 
their residence on the Old Campus had 
also previously been treated as a 
separate administrative unit within 
the University. Now, the separate 
freshman course book was discontinued 
and the position of Dean of Freshman ' 
was abolished. At the same time the 
position of college dean was estab-
lished. 
Beginning in the spring of 1965, a 
combination of rlsing studen"t -interest 
in educational issues and several 
sweeping policy changes made by the 
faculty generated a momentum that 
made it possible for radical change 
to take place. The Senior Advisory 
Board. an elected body of 
popular but apathetic and inef-
ficient seniors, decided that a 
Board appointed by Adminis-
tration and college officials and 
former SAB members would be 
more committed and hence 
more effective. The newly 
appointed Board soon had a 
hot issue on their hands when 
Yale refused to grant tenure 
to Richard Bernstein, a popular 
member of the philosophy 
department. Two weeks of 
student protest followed, 
including a 72-hour vigil in 
front of Woodbridge Hall. 
Bernstein was not reappointed, 
but a committee, chaired by 
Professor Robert Dahl, was 
established to investigate 
teachiug and tenure at Yale. 
As a result of the first Dahl 
report, which affirmed present 
standards of scholarship but 
suggested the setting of minimum 
standards of teaching competence 
for permanent appointments, 
parallel student and faculty 
committees on teaching were 
created. In addition, the faculty 
approved a proposal suggested by 
the SAB, providing for undergrad-
uate advisory committees on 
curriculum within the departments. 
Also in 1965, before the SAB had 
prepared a formal report on the 
subject, the Yale faculty assumed 
the initiative and overturned the 
system of group distributional 
requirements in effect since the 
first decade of the century. Dis-
tressed by undue emphasis on dis-
tribution at the expense of special-
ization, and disturbed by the poor 
quality of science courses offered 
to non-s<'·;mtists, Dean Georges 
May requested that the Co~ of 
Study Committee and an informal 
group of science professors reevalu-
ate distributional requirements. After 
consulting with the SAB, the Course 
of Study Committee-recom-
mended the abandonment of all 
subject matter requirements and 
thPir replacement with the guide-
lines still in use. The support of 
prestigious faculty for the proposal 
guaranteed its adoption. 
During the following year, the 
Course of Study Committee under 
some pressure from students and the 
SAB, reevaluated grades at Yale.
