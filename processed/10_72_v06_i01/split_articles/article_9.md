Little has been said and even less 
written about the duet of the Yale 
Daily News and Kingman Brewster 
last May. Yet, five months later its 
importance for study and discussion 
remains undiminished. Each of us 
involved in actions of struggle against 
the war last spring must examine what 
effect our ow n behavior has had on 
the magnitude of American aggression 
during the past summer and the present 
fall. 

On Friday, May 12, 1972, the Yale 
Daily News published a carefully 
worded statement in which Kingman 
Brewster pledged to suspend and 
possibly expel any student involved 
in militant demonstrations against 
William Rogers, Nixon's Secretary 
of State, during a visit planned for the 
following Monday night. That 
afternoon a t urbulent confrontation 
developed at the News offices 
between twenty members of the New 
Haven Air War Collective and four 
editors representing the .Vews --
~latthew Coles, Charles Cuneo. 
John Geesman, and l\Iichael Spencer. 
Members of the Collective accused 
the News editors of abetting 
Brewster's move to establish an 
atmosphere of threat and intimidation 
over the University community, in 
particular against anti-war forces. 
They were specifically angered by the 
News' ·failure to print in th eir 
Friday edition a statement entitled 
"The People Want Rogers."' The 
om1tted statement described the 
unprecedented action of the Yale 
Political Union, Rogers· host 
orgamzation , to close its membership 
lists a month and a half before the 
planned visit of Rogers. The denial 
of access to the orgamzation had 
begun pnor to the Westmoreland 
mcident and despite objections that 
continued throughout the spring. 
Collective members mamtained that 
the Political Union was using a Yale 
building without payment of rent 
to hold a closed meetmg of a closed 
society. The closing of member-
ship lists cannot easily be reconciled 
with Brewster's reference to the 
mt-eting as "an authorized 
University activity." In the unpub-
lished statement the Collective 
quest10ned the policy of the 
University administration to allow 
the use of Yale buildings by 
exclusive organizations for exclusive 
meetmgs. 

According to one Collective 
member. who had been denied 
ac<:ess to the Political Union. 
.. Brewster·s position on ·free speech· 
was transformed into a defense of 
the Political Union ·s denial of 
access into its organizatiOn. There 
is no • free speech· if people are 
not free to hear or are not given 
the right of access.·· 

Lawrence Lifschultz is a m em ber 
of the Yale Committee of Concerned 
Asian Scholars and participated in 
the even ts of last spring as a member 
of the New Haven A ir War Collective. 

The conflict at the News office 
sharpened when Collective members 
demanded that editors Coles, Cuneo, 
Geesman, and Spencer publish an 
extra edition prior to Rogers' 
anticipated arrival Monday evening. 
Due to their end-of-the-year 
schedule, the News had no plans 
to r un an edition unt il after Rogers' 
visit. The Collective maintained 
that the News had a responsi-
bility to the community, par-
ticularly to the several h undred 
people who would be putting 
their academic careers on the line 
come Monday. By publishing Brew-
ster's edict alone the paper had 
played a crucial political function 
in creating the mood of intimida-
tion. The people who faced 
expulsion wanted their position to 
be known and fully understood 
by all the students and faculty--
for it is from such understanding 
that defense and support would arise. 

At that point, the News editors 
refused to publish an e1>."tra edition. 
Their reasons and their subsequent 
retreat raise profound questions 
concerning the idea of a "free press·· 
in a capitalist society. The editors 
raised two issues to explain their 
unwillingness to run an extra 
edition: first, it was technically 
impossible since their special typist 
would be unavailable over the 
weekend; and second, the News 
would be financially incapable of 
covering the costs of an "extra. ·• 
One of the Collective members with 
the necessary "electronic tape" 
typing skill offered his service. The 
News refused. The Collective 
offered to purchase an ad to cover 
the cost of the edition. The News 
refused once again. 

The Collecttve demanded a better 
explanation for the News' continued 
refusal. Coles, Cuneo, Geesman, 
and Spencer asked to caucus in 
private. They withdrew and after 
fifteen minutes announced that they 
would publish the "extra" prior to 
Rogers' visit contingent on for mal 
consultation with their business 
manager and a few staff members. 
The News agreed to include the 
"People Want Rogers" statement and 
other critiques of Brewster's 
•·principled'' position. Moreover, they 
said to the group that technical 
problems would be overcome by the 
News itself. 

One Collective member interviewed 
this fall recalled, smiling, ·'You know, 
it's like the Chinese say. Liu Shao 
Chi always said that 'technical and 
economic" matters are the determining 
factor, while Mao maintained that in 
reality 'politics· is always in command. 
Well, we saw through the technical 
obstacles raised by the News editors 
to the essence of the problem-the 
refusal to prin t in reality was a 
political position . For a moment it 
was like in Shanghai in 1967 when the 
Red Guards seized control of 
People's Daily. The di(ference, of 
course, is that the Yale Daily News 
has never been a people 's daily." 
14/The New Journal/October 30, 1972 

Leaving the matter of Shanghai 
aside, there still remain a host of 
wider political questions to be asked. 
Why was it that on Friday May 12th 
the News published Brewster's 
position alone and failed to publish 
.1 critical response? The News not 
only had a copy of the statement 
in question but had already given 
verbal assurance that th ey would 
publish it in the Frid ay paper. 
Perhaps it did not appear because it 
questioned Brewster 's statement on 
too basic a level. And why did t he 
News so firmly resist the appeal by 
those willing to stand up to the 
expulsion threat who only wished to 
critique the theory of the hammer 
before it was lowered? 

Politics is the only plausible answer. 
The News editors consistently argued 
that "technical" considerations held 
them back , all the time denying their 
political prejudices. They were 
"objective journalists." Actually, there 
is no more objectivity in the political 
position of the News than there is in 
the New York Times which daily 
refers to the "communist enemy,., 
"enemy forces, .. "Vietcong,"' 
and "North Vietnam." The News 
played the Brewster statement and the 
Rogers appearance the way it did 
because it was predisposed to do so. 

As is well known by now, Rogers 
cancelled his appearance in New Haven 
and instead the Political Union 
presented the A. Whitney Griswold 
award for statesmanship to him in 
Washington this past summer. Whether 
or not Brewster actually knew of 
Rogers' pending cancellation prior to 
the public announcemen t, remains 
unclear. If, on the 12th , Brewster 
did not know that Rogers had 
cancelled, he is a lucky man the 
Secretary of State did not come. 

Still, it is not implausible that 
Brewster may have known th at 
Rogers would not sh ow, but went 
ahead anyway and issues h is May 12th 
"suspension and expulsion" 
statement. In so doing he would 
have neatly taken care of the 
criticism coming from his righ t 
which, personified by Eugene V. 
Debbs Rostow, had poured forth 
fire since the Westmoreland incident. 
Now Brewster had taken the 
ultimate stand of firmness against the 
insurrectionists. 

Yet, if Brewster knew that Rogers 
would not come, he also knew he 
would not have to carry out his 
threat. He would not have to face 
the "left" at Yale which had grown 
to substantial proportions following 
)lixon 's carpet bombing of Haiphong 
on April 16th and his later mining 
of Vietnamese harbors. It would 
have been an ugly scene for Kingman 
Brewster on May 15th in the streets 
outside Sprague Hall. Then the 
beneficent Kingman Brewster would 
have had an untold number of

that Rogers would not show and 
still went ahead with issuing his 
statement, then his political 
acumen for dealing with his 
right wing must be recognized. 

The final irony to the story 
still hasn't been told. When it 
became known that Rogers would 
not come, the New Haven Air 
War Collective, in recognition 
of the "impossible" obstaCles 
faced by the News editors, with-
drew its request for the "extra" 
edition. To the Collective's 
surprise, an "extra" of the Yale 
Daily News appeared on Monday 
morning anyway. It did not 
carry "The People Want Rogers" 
statement--or any mention of the 
Friday conflict at the News 
office. Even in retrospect, the 
oldest college daily had not found 
this news fit to print. The lead 
article was about none other than 
Kingman Brewster. Saturday he 
had gone on television and asked 
the people of New Haven to go 
to Washington and "lobby" 
against the war. "Objectively 
speaking," noted one Collective 
member, "Kingman Brewst~r 
didn't even offer to buy an ad in 
the News to pay for the cost of 
the extra edition." 
---
In the last decade various 
forms of opposition to the 
Vietnam war have developed. In 
this respect, it should be clearly 
understood that the editors of 
the News--Coles, Geesman, 
Cuneo, and Spencer--are all 
opposed to American involve-
ment in Vietnam. So is Kingman 
Brewster. Then what was all the 
·trouble about last April and May? 
Why were opponents of the war 
poised against each other? 

In the tenth year of our direct 
involvement in Vietnam, in the 
twentieth year since our support 
for France's reoccupation, and 
in the thirtieth year of the Viet-
namese struggle for independence, 
it is time to critically discuss the 
matters that divide those united 
against the war in Vietnam. 

There are two issues involved: 
strategy, and what Ken Mills 
used to call " a fundamental 
difference in world outlook." 

There is no denying that the 
Collective had hoped for a major 
social upheaval in this city and 
in the country. It was hoped 
that the aroused anger of the 
American people and the social 
disruptions causE!d by massive 
protest would be sufficiently 
forceful to throw a real scare into 
the Nixon administration and 
other attendant centers of ruling 
power in America. It was just 
such an upsurge in May 1970 
that forced Nixon to beat a 
hasty retreat from his invasion 
of Cambodia. 

Kingman Brewster and the 
~itors of the News opposed such 
an upheaval. Their position was 
one of moderation. Opposition 
111eant fasting, wearing black 
armbands, holding one-day mora-
toria, or lobbying in Washington. 
That done, all were to return to 
'Classes and take exams. Nixon's 
magnification of "automated 
massacre" did not prevent Yale 
authorities from announcing time 
·and again, "the leniency of 1970 
will not be repeated." 

The division over strategic 
practice among opponents of the 
war is at bottom a very funda-
mental ideological question. 
The Air War Collective maintained 
that only through a sharp upsurge 
of protest from the American 
people and from American stu-
dents in particular would the 
Dictatorship of the American 
Executive effect a retreat. The 
Collective had hoped that this 
University, along with others, 
would have shut down in a 
national student strike until 
Nixon had pulled back on his 
build-up of the air war. Of 
course, neither the strike nor a 
reduction in American bombing 
occurred. 

Brewster and the News op-
posed the strike. To relieve the 
pressure on the University they 
both maintained that at Yale 
"there is no enemy" and thus a 
strike against the University had 
no purpose. The enemy, of 
course, is always elsewhere--never 
before you. This position, how-
ever, belies the fact that in May 
1970 a forceful national stu-
dent strike had real impact in 
checking further .American ag-
gression against the Cam bod ian 
people. 

At issue last spring was the 
question of whether the revolt 
emerging in the country would be 
contained or would develop fur-
ther. It was crucial to various 
political groups, among which 
the News and Brewster must both 
be included, to achieve contain-
ment in the form of a "manage-
able protest". A major upheaval, 
it was said, would only play into 
the hands of the Administration. 

Yet, five months later--following 
a spring, summer and fall of the 
most intense bombing in the his-
tory of mankind--it must be asked 
who really played into whose 
hands. 

Brewster and the News sup-
ported a one-day lobby effort in 
Washington. The tactic was a 
classic one. If it is your institu-
tion the people are threatening 
to strike or disturb, then you 
must deflect them from their 
object. They must be led in a 
different direction; that is, away 
from New Haven and down to 
Washington. 

15/The New Journal/October 30, 1972. 
It would have been different 
if the trip to Washington had 
been part of a national call to 
go to the capital. Neither 
Brewster nor the News were 
prepared to make such a call. 
To do so might have created a 
mushrooming effect. This 
clearly had to be avoided. In-
stead, a few buses just for New 
Haveners rolled down to D.C. 
and rolled back. Tt son h~rl hP.P.n 
nice and manageable. And very 
soon all returned to normal ex-
cept for the Vietnamese. 

These differences in strategic 
. practice are at bottom important 
ideological issues. There is a 
clear difference between being 
anti-the-Vietnam war and being 
anti-imperialist. While both 
·Brewster and the News may be 
the former, they are certainly not 
the latter. 

Brewster in particular has not 
broken with the ideology of 
America's World Empire. Last 
spring he stood out as a seeming-
ly tortured enigma who privately 
considered the possibility of 
following the president of Am-
herst College in civil disobedience, 
while publicly threatening to 
expel any student who might 
break the "law." He stands in 
the eye of such a contradiction 
because he has not broken fun-
dame~tally with the premises 
underlying this country's inter-
national empire. Nor is there 
any reason given his position, 
past practice, and class to expect 
that he ever will make such a 
break. 

It is clear that Brewster has 
not even approached such trans-
formation. He continues to per-
petuate the very mystification 
about America's 'role in the 
world', that has led to so much 
sadness for our own country and 
for the Indochinese. Last April, 
in the same month B-52's bombed 
Haiphong for the first time, 
Brewster wrote the following in 
Foreign Affairs: 

The United States does occupy 
a position of indispensability to 
the security and economy of the 
. rest of the world .. .Any potential 
aggression should be kept on 
notice of what might be called 
our 'exasperation points.' The 
American electorate would react 
explosively to the outrage of 
unambiguous aggression in areas 
where we feel visceral commitment 
by affinity, a territorial commit-
ment by proximity or moral com-
mitment by promise. 

It was enough to have heard 
at the start of the sixties John 
Kennedy say, "To those 
'peoples in the huts and vil-
lages of half the globe struggling 
to break the bonds of mass mis-
ery, we pledge our best efforts 
to help them help themselves." 
It was enough to have heard that 
and then to have watched 
Kennedy set up strategic ham-
lets, schools of counter-insur-
gency, and an Alliance For 
·Progress which was no more than 
an alliance for counterrevolution. 
But it is more than eno-qgh--it 
is too much--in 1972 to hear 
Kingman Brewster speak about 
informing potential aggressors of 
America's "exasperation points." 

:Brewster's position that America 
must stand ready to defend the 
world from aggression is no more 
than an obfuscation for his real 
defense of American hegemony 
in the world. Lastly, Brewster 
writes that the American people 
"would react explosively to the 
.outrage of unambiguous aggres-
sion." We must presume of 
course, that Brewster did not 
·"react explosively" last spring, 
.but instead worked hard to insure 
that no "explosion" would occur, 
because the "unambiguous aggres-
sion" was that of his own country. 

The duet of the Yale Daily News 
News and Kingman Brewster in 
the period of heightened slaughter 
last spring must be studied and 
discussed. It is important for all 
who oppose the war--indeed, who 
oppose the Empire. A deeper 
understanding of questions con-
cerning ideology and strategic 
practice is essential if our coming 
struggle against this war and yet 
unenacted American tragedies is 
to be more effective. In The 
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
Bonaparte, referring to Hegel's 
comment that all facts and per-
sonages of great importance in 
wprld history occur, as it were, 
twice. Marx wrote, "He forgot 
to add; the first time as tragedy, 
the second as farce." Our 
actions in Spring '72 were in-
adequate to stem the new level 
of aggression against the Vietnam-
ese. That is the tragedy. We 
must better inform our practice, 
to avoid the farce that would be 
a greater tragedy. •
