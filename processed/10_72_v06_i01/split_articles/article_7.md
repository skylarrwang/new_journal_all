"Bill Fulbright has suffered for 
some time from a Cassandra complex," 
said a Senatorial colleague of the 
Chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. With reason enough, 
for Fulbright has spent more than a 
decade warning of the dangers that 
come from the arrogance of power. 
In 1961 he advised John Kennedy 
against the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
Throughout 1965 and 1966 he 
warned Lyndon Johnson not to 
escalate the Vietnam War--and was 
rewarded with whispered rumors 
about his mental balance. 

But on one occasion, while 
Fulbright's advice was good, his 
prophecy was wrong. One pleasant 
spring afternoon in 1969, he went to 
the White House for an amiable 
two-hour discussion with Richard 
Nixon and Henry Kissinger. He 
respectfully suggested to the 
President that the 1968 election had 
given him a mandate to seek a 
compromise in Vietnam, withdraw 
American troops, and leave Vietnam's 
internal problems to the Vietnamese. 
He cautioned against confusing US 
interests with those of the Saigon 
regime, and warned against ~e 
"siren song" of those Amencan 
strategists who wanted to tum the 
last corner--only "to lure the United 
States into a deeper and more 
devastating war." And he advised, 
urged, even pleaded, that the 
President act before he became a 
prisoner of events. 

Then came the pleasant prophecy. 
"U you stop the war," he said, "which 
is what people expect, you can do 
almost anything else and be re-elected. 
The people will be that grateful to 
you." 

The President smiled. A Nixon 
smile. "That's what I'm going to do." 

Nixon did not follow Fulbright's 
advice. He did not end the war; indeed, 
he has made it even more terrible. Yet, 
like a matinee magician, he has given 
the appearance of peace, and that has 
been enough to win the people's 
gratitude in this quirky political year. 
Meanwhile, President-Chairman 
relations have fallen to just about where 
they were under Johnson, below freezing. 
"Except in the line of official duty," 
said Fulbright with some acidity, "he 
doesn't see me now." 

"America may be coming to the 
close of a circle," Fulbright recently 
wrote. Certainly Fulbright has closed his 
quarter-century circle--from the powerless 
critic to powerful insider to powerless 
critic. As chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee he in fact wields 
Daniel Yergin, Class of 1968, was 
a founding-editor of The New 
Journal. He is currently writing 
a Ph. D. thesis for Cambridge 
University on the early years of 
the Cold War. He has 
contributed to the New York Times 
Magazine, New York Magazine, and 
the Yale Review. 
only influence, not power; yet despite 
an almost sure rank among history's 
greatest Senators, his influence is at 
its lowest ebb. It is evident in his 
manner. He tires more easily, shows 
boredom, and is more openly irritated. 

Indeed, Fulbright is a lonely, 
isolated figure, respected but not 
popular in his chamber. Intellectually, 
he is a Woodrow Wilson, alive and well 
in a world of Cold Warriors and would-be 
Metternichs. Yet--and this is his 
paradox--long-time observers think that 
he has never been more creative, that 
never has he spoken with greater 
urgency. 

Though today Fulbright may sound 
like a Cassandra, there is also something 
of the converted sinner about him. The 
label 'dove' is out-of-date. He has gone 
through a transformation so thorough 
that he rejects the entire course of 
postwar US foreign policy, and thus 
rejects much of his own past. Men do 
not normally change their ideas in 
their 60's, but Fulbright now operates 
on a new set of assumptions, 
fundamentally different from those 
which guided him ten years ago. 

To fathom the Senator from 
Arkansas, however, is no easy thing. 
He is a complicated man, marked by 
contradictions on every level--a searing 
sarcasm and a courtly manner; long 
digressions on points that interest 
him in hearings, and yet impatience 
and even condescension toward those 
whom he considers dim; intense 
curiosity and a low boredom threshold; 
becoming modesty and a peacock's 
pride; a deep and wide-ranging intellect 
and yet a peevish tum; humanitarianism 
on a global scale and a slim civil 
rights record; fierce bursts of energy 
and periods of moodiness, bordering 
on depression; a sometimes wry, 
sometimes mocking cynicism and yet 
high-flying idealism; conservatism 
about the limits of human capabilities 
yet utopianism about international 
organization. And finally, arrogance 
and self doubt. 

He evokes wildly contradictory 
responses in people. One of Johnson's 
State Department people: "Fulbright 
is an embittered, almost wild man, 
without a rudder." Stuart Symington: 
"Courage is part of the man's 
character." A former National 
Security Council member: "You can 
fault him for a number of things--
tactical judgment, ego, absorption in 
trivia--but I doubt you could tmd a 
more gifted man to run any institution 
in our government!' A fellow 
Senator: "Fulbright is sometimes 
his own worst enemy." 

Yet one finds a consistent evolution 
in his thought, begirming with the 
sober critiques in Old Myths and 
New Realities in 1964 and The 
Arrogance of Power in 1966, and 
culminating in a startling new book 
called The Crippled Giant. It is 
startling because it amounts to an 
obituaiy for the Cold War, a 
complef.e rejection of the conventional 
wisdom. Fulbright declares that the 
United States must share with the 
Soviet Union some apportionment of 
blame for the Cold War. 

"Change," he writes, "has come not 
from wisdom but from disaster." He 
suggests that the American public and 
its leaders, including one J. William 
.Fulbright, have gotten it wrong, not 
completely perhaps, but wrong 
enough to make way for Vietnam and 
other potential disasters. We misunder-
stood the men--and the minds of the 
men--in Moscow, Peking and Indochina. 
We decided without real evidence 
that they were part of a giant 
international revolutionary conspiracy, 
and failed to observe that they were 
also nationalists. We set off on a universal 
crusade, all too often military in form, 
called "containment." 

"I suspect too,, the Senator writes, 
"if Khrushchev and Mao and Ho had 
not had the name of 'Communist,' we 
might have recognized them as men we 
could respect: tough and sometimes 
ruthless, but patriots nonetheless, 
committed to the well-being of their own 
people." Certainly, we have accepted 
lesser lights like Franco, Salazar, Yayha 
Khan, the Greek Colonels and numerous 
dim Latin American luminaries into the 
firmament of the Free World. 

To reach the Senator, you pass through 
an outer office decorated with photographs 
of Fulbright and Johnson in earnest 
conversation, with inked captions by LBJ 
in chronological order: "To J. William 
Fulbright, than whom there is no better"; 
"To Bill Fulbright, who listens--maybe-
perhaps"; "To Bill. I can see I haven't 
been very persuasive." An aide later 
explained that Fulbright has probably 
forgotten the photos are there. 

Then down a corridor lined with cartoon 
originals until, at last, into his office-the 
Senator, occasionally sipping ice water and 
smoking cigarettes, began talking about 
the evolution of his ideas. The blinds were 
drawn in such a way that the shadows 
fell across Fulbright, reminding you of a 
country lawyer's office on Main Street on 
a warm, lazy afternoon. Fulbright was 
tense, upset and exasperated by the further 
escalation of the air war. His face tends 
toward gauntness, so that his ears seem 
to droop away from his head. His 
clothes in this warm weather were those 
that only a banker or a statesman would 
feel constrained to wear--black, sober, 
responsible, with a vest and watchchain. 
But it is the voice that catches you, an 
instrument he plays for effect-resonant 
in tone, varying in speed, courtly in 
marmer, all wrapped for delivery in a 
rich Arkansas accent. 

"Well, it would be a very odd thing if 
I didn't change my views in the light of 
new knowledge," he said, responding to 
a question about the frequent charge 
that he is inconsistent. "It isn't so much 
that you change your views relative to 
certain facts-it's that new facts, new 
elements appear." 

Fulbright has discovered these new 
elements in hearings, formerly classified 
papers, memoirs, and in the works of 
revisionist historians. 

Yet as he talked, Fulbright was 
careful to qualify and requalify his 
judgments. On the one hand, Stalin 
was a "very ominous character"; on the 
other, Russia's "very traumatic 
experience in World War II gave some 
justification for fearing a resurgent 
Germany." 

Fulbright's own involvement in 
foreign affairs goes back to the middle 
of World War II when, as a freshman 
representative, he wrote a one-sentence-· 
long resolution, bearing his name, in 
which the House put itself on record 
in favor of US membership in a 
postwar UN. With this resolution safely 
tucked in his hip pocket, Secretary 
of State Cordell Hull finally felt 
confident enough, at age 72, to take 
his first airplane trip to Moscow to 
begin talking about founding the UN 
with the British and Russians. After 
the war, Fulbright authored the 
legislation setting up the international 
scholarship p~:ogram bearing his name. 
Also in late 1945 Fulbright spoke 
out in one of the most thoughtful 
critiques of Truman's foreign policy. 
"We have already fallen to quarreling 
with Russia, like two big dogs chewing 
on a bone ... To be tough or to 
be soft, toward a nation is not a 
policy. Our objectives ... should be to 
obtain their assistance in the creation 
of a bona {ide organization based 
upon law." 

By the spring of 1946, subject to the 
same pressures that quieted other critics, 
Fulbright had subscribed to the Cold 
War consensus that guided US policy--
and stilled dissent-until the late 
1960's. In May 1946, he asked in a 
speech: "Is it the purpose of Russia 
to dominate the world through a 
subtle combination of infiltration and 
force?" Along with the rest of the 
foreign policy caste, he answered 'yes.' 

Now sitting in his office and as 
though recalling that very speech, he 
said, "After World War II, we were sold 
on the idea that Stalin was out to 
dominate the world. I didn't have the 
knowledge or foresight to make a 
judgment at the time. I didn't know 
about Ho 's letters to Washington--or 
that they were ignored. Very few people 
did make the right judgment. Henry 
Wallace sensed it, he had a feeling 
about it, but he was ridiculed for 
being a visionary, an appeaser, 
unrealistic. 

"The crux of the problem was 
the generalization of the Truman 
Doctrine. It changed from a 
rescue operation for Greece in 
1947 into an ideological crusade. 
It created the attitude, the state 
of mind, that later led to Viet 
Nam." Again the qualification. 
"That was most unfortunate. 
But I'm not trying to say that 
Mr. Truman or Mr. Acheson is 
to blame. Judging it at the time, 
I'm not saying that I or anybody 
else would have been much 
better." 

In 1959, Majority Leader 
Lyndon Johnson finally per-
suaded Theodore Green, the 
91-year-old, somewhat deaf and 
often sleepy chairman of the 
foreign relations committee, 
to step aside. Fulbright became 
the committee's new chairman. 
He and Johnson had a mutual 
admiration society going. Ful-
bright remarked of President-
elect Kennedy: "He'll be as 
good a President as he makes use 
of Lyndon Johnson's political 
genius." Johnson in turn looked 
on him, perhaps a bit enviously, 
as a Southern·style intellectual 
and respected his independence. 
Kennedy, at Johnson's fervent 
urging, had considered Fulbright--
who was not sure he really 
wanted the job--as his first 
choice for Secretary of State; 
but Robert Kennedy, fearing 
that Fulbright's backbench 
support of the Southern anti-
civil rights bloc in Congress 
would alienate new African 
nations, talked his brother out of 
it. 

Civil rights has been Ful-
bright's famous flaw. During the 
late 1950's and early 1960's, he 
never supported civil rights leg-
islation. The reply has always 
been that, to be a statesman, you 
must get re-elected, and you don't 
get re-elected--or at least didn't--
in Arkansas by championing 
civil rights. 

Today Fulbright feels that the 
Kennedy policies, as much as 
those of Eisenhower, aggravated 
the Cold War, for he thinks the 
Russians were more intent on 
"businesslike relations" than we 
ever believed. He has a special 
nostalgia for Khrushchev, who he 
says built a golf course in the 
Crimea in preparation for 
the visit Eisenhower did not make 
in 1960. "In looking back on 
him," Fulbright recalled, "from 
various things he said, from when 
he was over here, it seems to me 
that he was hoping in his rather 
blunt way to do constructive 
business with us--to normalize 
relations." 

The Senator now believes that 
Khrushchev's "We will bury you" 
did refer to economic competi-
tion; that the "wars of national 
liberation," which did so much to 
gear up the Kennedy action-intel-
lectuals for Vietnam, may have 
been a verbal device, targeted for 
Peking; that the missiles in Cuba 
may have had more to do with 
Khrushchev's troubles with the 
Soviet military than with a 
c;iesire to immolate the US. 

The change began to come for 
Fulbright in 1964 and 1965, when 
he started to lose confidence in 
the men, institutions and policies 
with which he had identified. His 
expectations for the Johnson 
Presidency had been great--indeed, 
he later said he looked forward to
