"He used to listen," said Ful-
bright of Johnson, " but in evalua-
ting my advice against that of his 
chief advisers, McNamara and 
Rusk, he decided that they 
knew the facts." 
The open break carne over the 
Dominican Republic in 1965. 
The Administration claimed that 
American nationals were endan-
gered, that a Communist uprising 
was at the core of the civil strife. 
A careful Foreign Relations 
Committee study, however, con-
vinced Fulbright that the Adminis-
tration had used a phony Red 
Scare to justify both to itself and 
to the country an unjl~stifiable 
intervention. On September 15, 
1965, he rose in the Senate: "The 
Administration acted on the 
premise that the revolution was 
controlled by communists--a 
premise which it failed to estab-
lish at the time and has not 
established since." 
" Mr. Johnson never forgave me " 
said Fulbright. "After that, we 
' 
never had a private meeting. 
Never again was I consulted." A 
pained little smile crossed his fa<;e. 
"Of course, when I look back on 
it, I wasn't ever really consulted in 
the sense tl1at he was ever interested 
in what I had to say. He had made 
up his mind already. He was 
trying to keep me within bounds, 
so I wouldn't take issue and em bar-

This event solidified his growing 
doubts about the whole course of 
US policy. By the time of the 1966 
Vietnam hearings, he Wil& already 
a dove. Johnson clearly put 
Fulbright at the top among "Nervous 
Nellies." In private, the President 
accused Fulbright of everything . 
from disloyalty, to being "unable 
to park his bicycle straight," to 
outright racism. "The President 
used to say that Fulbright had a 
little old racial problem--he didn't 
think little yellow people cared as 
much for Freedom as white folks " 
recalled a former high State 
Department official. 

Fulbright, who never savored the 
role of Congressional crank, was 
upset by innuendoes in Johnson's 
Washington that his dissent was a 
gymptom of abnormal psychology--
so upset in fact that he twice 
arranged hearings on the interaction 
of psychology and international 
politics. "People ridiculed the whole 
idea," he said, "but they proved to 
be two of the most interesting series 
we've ever had. I was very interested 
myself, be<;ause I've often 
wondered why I take a different 
view from others." 

" It's not for me to be a Freud" 
he added, but he did trace his 
current role back to his family and 
childhood. "There was nothing in 
my background to give me the 
same kind of egotism--I'm not sure 
that's the right word, it may be 
offensive--as Lyndon Johnson." He 
emphasized the importance of his 
father's death when he was 18. 
"He left six children and my poor 
mother. We thought we were going 
to the poorhouse. I was young, 
and we were distracted, and I 
~earned humility--if you want to 
call it that. I wasn't prepared to be 
pushing people around. I was trying 
to survive." 

. This back~ounc} has made Fulbright 
mde~ndent--:ntellectually, financially, 
emot10nally--all his life. "The 
combination of all these types of 
things," he said, "gives you a differ-
ent attitude, a different approach 
under certain circumstances. I 
would react differently from Johnson--
and Nixon. It was much more difficult 
for Mr. Johnson to accept what he 
would interpret as a defeat than for 
me. It's the background against which 
you make judgments, without being 
conscious of it." 

He reflected for a moment. "I 
remember a curious experience." He 
described a White House meeting in 
February, 1965, when the decision to 
escalate the bombing was taken. Only 
Senator Mike Mansfield and he took 
issue. "I didn't have any particular 
reason for dissenting, for disagreeing. 
I had no intelligence reports." He said 
that wiijl a certain disdain. "It just 
seemed the wrong thing to do. It 
was purely instinctive." 

" There's still the underlying 
feeling that it is our responsibility 
to build up what they call a 
"structur~ for ~ace"--not unlike
