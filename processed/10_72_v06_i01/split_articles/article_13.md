becoming captives of their smaller 
allies, the tremendous restrains 
imposed by nuclear weapons, that 
balance of power systems tend to 
breakdown as Kissinger's vaunted 
Vienna system collapsed in August 
1914. 

While others have made many of 
these specific points, Fulbright's 
program, in its entirety, has a 
coherence. In effect, he has articu-
lated what is today's "opposition 
line" more clearly than anybody else. 
His influence lS clearly felt today, 
however, only in Congress' efforts 
to get back its role in policy-making 
• 
"Nobody has had more impact than 
him," said Stuart Symington. "A 
lot of people prattle on the floor 
about the dignity of the Senate, but 
he's the one who's worked really 
hard to preserve the prerogative of 
the Senate. The Senate's new look 
is embodied in how he handles it. If 
he should not come back to the 
Senate after the 1974 elections, 
it would be a disaster for the 
country." 

Not everybody bends to 
Fulbright's leadership. He has been 
criticized lately for tactics. Moreover, 
a dozen or so Senators can be expected 
to vote immediately against any 
legislation or resolution bearing his 
name. And a lot of Congressman 
simply resent him. Last year, Rep. 
Thomas Morgan, ·chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
was asked what had happened in a 
conference meeting between his 
committee and the Fbreign Relations 
Committee. "Nothing happened," 
Morgan snapped, "except that 
Professor Fulbright lectured us for 
( 
• an hour." 

The tum-about in Congressional 
attitude on its role can be dated to 
August 17, 196 7, when Undersec-
retary of State Nicholas Katzenbach 
told a Foreign Relations Committee 
hearing that, in the context of the 
Vietnam War, "the expression of 
declaring war is one that has become 
outmoded in the international arena." 
Katzenbach was thus saying that the 
Presidential prerogative on major 
questions was virtually complete. 

In the years since, the Senate, 
sometimes a majority, but more 
often a substantial but growing minority, 
has sought to regain its role. This 
new kind of bipartisanship has taken 
many forms-from the anti-ABM 
coalition, to stop-the-war amendments, 
to efforts to force the President to 
reveal all secret executive agreements. 
But, as the Haiphong mining and 
more recent escalations of the air 
war prove, Congress' role in foreign 
.. policy is more brave talk than 
actual fact. The message was clear in 
the subdued, almost-empty hearing 
rooms during the testimony on the 
Pentagon Papers on the mc.rning 
Nixon's mines off Haiphong were 
activated. It was even clearer in a 
caucus during the May crisis when 
a Senator who had called for an 
"audience" with the President was 
sharply reminded by Mike Mansfield: 
"Not an audience, but a meeting. 
He's not king-yet." 

" We've been trying everythmg we 
.. 
can think of," said Fulbright, "but 
we've been thwarted. One of the 
main reasons for the inability of 
Congress to reassume its proper 
role is the existence of the war!' 
His secretary buzzed him. He would 
have to go to the floor shortly to 
vote on a war fund cut-off---a 
vote in which the Administration 
would once again scrape through. 
But he continued, "When you have 
a Congress and a country dominated 
by this war fever, the feeling that 
our men are on the front lines--" He 
shook his head. " It's an atmosphere 
almost impossible to overcome." 

"It's true, as societies become more 
complex, there's a natural tendency 
toward the concentration of power 
in the executive. And an economic 
crisis or a war always leads to an 
exaggeration of executive power. 
We've been in a fof'o/:rear -~risis. 
This is the fundamental reason for 
the deterioration of Congress. 
There's nothing you can do until 
you can get over the feeling that 
there is impending disaster, and 
you've got to look to the great leader." 

Yet Fulbright has been doing 
something. He and Eugene McCarthy 
made dissent respectable. Beyond 
that, Fulbright was the first to 
begin-at first tentatively a decade ago, 
then with increasing confidence--to 
suggest the outlines and orientations 
for a new US foreign policy. He 
began this effort long before the old 
orthodoxy had collapsed, at a time 
when Henry Kissinger was still 
engrossed in the nuclear doom 
books of the Cold War. 

So, he may be less the outcast, 
the Cassandra, and more the teacher 
than he recognizes. He is as much 
the foreign policy professor as 
Kissinger. For this new Nixon-
Kissinger line--in its better moments, 
stripped of its geopolitical jargon· 
and Spenglerian gloom, separated 
from its powerful anti-communist 
remnants--shows remarkable 
congruity with the Fulbright out-
line. It turns out that they too 
have been listening, at least 
some of the time. It's just that 
they prefer to forget where they 
heard it first. 

The conversation, as it ended, 
returned to the Vietnam war. 
Fulbright always returns to the 
war; it is an obsession, but one 
grounded in our recent history. 
For him the war is both a sign and 
a cause of our misfortunes. It has 
crippled our foreign policy, drained 
resources, eroded the national life, 
and destroyed the credibility of 
government. 

His secretary had buzzed him 
again, and the bells for a vote were 
ringing as he walked from his office 
into the hallway of the New 
Senate Office Building. He was 
asked how effective he has been. He 
was standing now by the special 
elevator for Senators that would 
take him to the ba&ement, where 
he would catch a tram that would 
carry him to the Capitol. The 
Senate page held the door open. 
Fulbright shrugged, as though weary 
at the end of a long, frustrating, day. 
" I haven't been effective at all, have 
I? The war's still going on." He 
said it matter-of-factly, almost 
coldly. Perhaps there was in his 
voice a note of sadness as well. •

with stereo components by 
Advent. Sansui, and BSR, 
$400 
now buys 
you all 
~a:iBJ~the music. 
Until very recently. if you set out with four hundred dollars to purchase a 
complete stereo system. you were likely to be disappointed. To purchase a 
music system that could reproduce the lowest octave(s) of deep bass, you 
found you had to spend about six hundred dollars; for four hundred dollars a 
component system did not exist which could produce really low bass. 
But this has now changed. Because of two new products, we are now able to 
offer (and guarantee) a complete AM/FM stereo phonograph system which 
provides the necessary range to reproduce all music. The system consists of 
two new Smaller Advent Loudspeakers, a Sansui 350A AM/FM stereo 
receiver. and a BSR 510A/X automatic turntable with a Shure elliptical 
diamond cartridge. The new* Smaller Advent Loudspeakers and the Sansui 
receiver· make possible the increased performance and lower cost of this 
system. 

The Smaller Advent is the only loudspeaker costing less than the original 
Advent which can reproduce the entire musical range. Through the Smaller 
Advent you can hear the bottom octave of piano and pipe organ, the lowest 
notes of the double bass. or the bottom string of an electric bass guitar: 
(These low frequency sounds have a lot to do with the enjoyment you will 
derive from your music system.) 

On all kinds of musical material, and. under most listening conditions likely 
to apply in most homes. the Smaller Advent is the equal of any speaker 
system available. 

No technical sorcery is responsible for the surpnsmg performance of the 
Smaller Advent Loudspeaker. To build into the speaker its excellent low 
frequency capabilities, Advent has had to give up a small amount of 
efficiency and power·handling ability: the Smaller Advents will not play as 
loudly as the larger Advents.

ADVENT 
The Sansui AM/fM stereo receiver provides enough power to satisfy both you 
and the Advent speakers; it delivers into the four-ohm Advents more than 
15.0 watts of RMS power, over the entire audio range, with less than 0.5% 
total distortion. (RMS is the most demanding and least flashy of the various 
power rating systems.) The FM and AM tuner sections of the Sansui receiver 
are both sensitive and selective: weak stations as well as strong will be 
received with a surprising fullne~s and clarity. 

To match the level of quality which the Sansui receiver and the Smaller 
Advent speakers represent, we recommend the BSR 51 OA/X automatic 
turntable. It has a good heavy platter, a convenient cueing control. and 
minimal (also inaudible) wow. flutter, and rumble. The BSR. with the Advent 
speakers and the Sansui receiver, allow us to offer you a quality sound system 
at a cost substantially lower than that which was previously possible. 

We include with the BSR a dust·cover, a base, and a Shure cartridge -
a 
smooth, light-tracking, wide-range cartridge with fine high frequency 
capabilities. It complements the excellent high frequency characteristics of 
the Smaller Advent Loudspeakers and the Sansui receiver. 

The complete system, guaranteed for two years, parts and labor. costs $399. 
You can sit back and hear all the music. 

*In most talk about stereo equipment, a "new" product is one that is either 
"better" or "worse" than a "not-new" product. (Sometimes it is "the same", 
but with a few additional frills -
black-light front panel, Day-Gio controls. 
Remote Control, etc.) The Smaller Advent Loudspeaker is really "new" -
not better or worse than the original Advent. It was design~ to answer a very 
real need - the need for a quality loudspeaker at a low cost and of small size 
which could provide every sonic character that most people associate with the 
best possible loudspeaker, when connected to a low-cost receiver or amplifier.
