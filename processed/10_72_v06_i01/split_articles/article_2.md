In a year when Yale was sweating 
out its worst financial crisis in 
memory, the University community 
was staggered in early September 
by the revelation that the predicted 
operating deficit of $5.75 million 
for 1971-72 had missed the mark 
by more than four and a half 
million dollars. The discrepancy 
between the predicted deficit and 
the actual $1.2 million figure made 
news across the nation, disturbed 
and infuriated many faculty and 
administrators, and upset the 
operations of several key planning 
committees charged with produc-
ing remedies for Yale's financial 
ills. 

The deficit issue, with prodding 
from news reports, exploded into 
a lively controversy, apparently 
fraught with internal politics, 
laced with bitter feelings, and 
confused with reckless accusations. 
The controversy seemed to threaten 
the credibility of the Brewster 
Administration and cast suspicion 
on the competence of University 
Treasurer John Ecklund. It even 
raised eyebrows among the 
Fellows of ~he Yale Corporation. 

The initial fires of the controversy 
have calmed enough to permit a 
more clear-headed assessment 
of the deficit situation. The report 
of the Provost on the reasons for 
the miscalculation has found no 
single cause for the miscalculated 
deficit, but rather a string of small 
causes that added up to produce the 
discrepancy. Yet the deficit error 
has had a profound effect on the 
short term planning of the 
University, and additional results 
that may not be known for some time. 


The recent history of Yale's 
financiaJ picture begins in 1965, when 
computer technology entered the 
process. At about the same time, a 
new administration and financial 
team was assembling--Kingman 
Brewster had assumed the Presidency 
a year earlier; John Ecklund, the 
University Treasurer, and Robert 
O'Connor, the Budget Director, 
moved in a few years later. At this 
time, unfortunately, money became 
a problem. And so began a new era 
in the University's history. Yale, 
the proud University that had 
recently provided waiters and maids 
for its students, now found itself 
with a budget deficit. Between 
1967 and 1970 the annual 
deficit climbed from $300,000 to 
an imposing $1.8 million.

American. 

At first, the financial crisis in 
higher education was less threatening 
at Yale than at many other 
Universities, but the ultimate impact 
of growing budget deficit would 
prove equally fatal. Neither new 
computers nor skilled budget officials 
could alter the stark fact that a 
budget deficit must be made up out 
of the .University's endowment, the 
source which provides yale with 25 
per cer\t ot her annuaJ mcome ana 
holds the key to her future growth 
and financial stability. Depleting 
the endowment necessarily results 
in irrevocable loss of future income. 

In December, 1970, John Ecklund 
cast an understandably gloomy eye 
to the future, and predicted that 
Yale's deficit would be $8 million 
in 1971-2 if current practices 
continues unaltered. Ecklund's 
forecast was not a warning estimated 
off the top of his head. Although they 
had just wrapped up the '69-'70 
fiscal year, and were in the midst of 
'70-'71, University officials were 
mired in the long process of 
constructing the '71-'72 budget. 
Their deadline was May, 1971, at 
which time the Yale Corporation 
would approve their proposed 
budget. 

By late summer 1970, O'Connor 
and his staff of seven were already 
making income and.expenditure 
estimates for the 1971-72 budget. 
The Treasurer makes the official 
pronouncements and gets wqat 
little publicity there generally is in 
that department, but the official at 
the heart of the budgetary process is 
O'Connor. He spoke to Alumni 
Fund officers and fund-raisers, 
examined the Endowment and 
possible government funds, and made 
reasonable projections based on 
his research and experience. He also 
examined the University's current 
cos~ set-up, spoke to personnel 
officials about their needs, and thus 
began formulating a notion of 
possible expenses. 

Estimating endowment income 
is impossible, for that would 
require predicting the performance 
of the stock market in the year 
ahead. How then does the 
University arrive at a budget 
figure? 

As Ecklund observes, "This 
turns out to be the simplest thing 
of all," and what makes it 
simple is the "University 
Equation." In esst:nce, the 
University decides before the year 
begins how much it will spend 
from endowment income, and any 
errors in estimation are taken into 
account in the following year's 
allowance. 

With the preliminary work 
completed, a slew of officials 
entered the process in the form of 
the University Budget Committee. 
Its members included the Provost, 
the Associate Provost, the
