his report ready for faculty consider-
ation by November. He has expressed 
the cautious hope that some of the 
committee's suggestions may be put 
into effect by the 1973-74 academic 
year. 

The Blum committee is not the 
only University planning group that 
has suffered from the deficit 
discrepancy. Controversy generated 
by Yale's financial affairs has also 
.delayed chances for serious 
discussion of the suggestions for 
long-range changes in the academic 
structure of the University set forth 
in the Dahl report. Academic changes 
have been swept aside by more 
pressing financial questions, 
especially those centering on the 
extended semester plan suggested in 
the appendix to the report. Dahl 
and his group are especially 
chagrined by the attention focused 
on the relatively minor appendix to 
the report. "Had the deficit 
question never been mentioned, our 
report would have received more 
serious consideration,., Dahl says. 
As the matter stands, Dahl feels 
that the misprojected deficit 
and the ensuing controversy 
has "discredited the Dahl report 
as a whole." 

Another important, yet less 
tangible, consequen~e of the 
. 
deficit discrepancy 1s the quest1on 
. -·:h _, 
it raises of the administration's 
credibility. As Brewster indicated 
in his September 8 letter to the 
Corporation he feels his own cred-
ibility has been threatened. It re-
mains to be seen just how much of 
the damage is repaired by the 
~port of the Provost. 

The faculty has received an 
annual "crisis report" from the 
Provost each year since 1970, the 
year when austerity measures were 
first put into effect. The faculty 
tended to disregard these reports, 
and there was a certain sentiment 
'among them that the Administration 
was crying "wolf." During the 
_spring of 1972, however, when the 
Administration reported on the 
projected state of the University's 
'financial health during considera-
tion of the extended semester 
proposal, the faculty at last 
began to believe that an emergency 
existed. This partially explains why 
the faculty created the Summer 
Study Committee. 

With the surprising news from 
the Treasurer's Office this fall, 
there was cause for many faculty 
members to believe that the Ad-
ministration had cried " wolf" 
again. Reductions had been made 
in the number of faculty positions 
starting in the year 1970-71, 
reductions that hit the ranks of 
untenured junior faculty 
especially hard, and, in the 
opinion of some faculty members, 
30 waterfront street 
new haven 
lowered the quality of Yale 
teaching. Although the need for 
the faculty cutbacks is apparently 
not mitigated by this year's 
unexpectedly low deficit, the 
effects of a huge deficit that 
never materialized must be 
reckoned with if the Adminis-
tration is to maintain its credi-
bility with the faculty. 

One last damaging effect of 
the deficit affair is the pressure 
heaped, perhaps unfairly, on the 
Treasurer himself. Especially in 
:the press coverage of the deficit 
revelation, there were reports of 
internal politicking and personal 
criticism of those responsible for 
computing the projected deficit. 
There was speculation that 
Brewster's letter to the Corporation 
constituted such a criticism of the 
Treasurer. This speculation over-
dramatized the point of Brewster's 
letter and at the same time 
clouded an already complicated 
issue. Perhaps during the heat of 
the publicized controversy, some 
tension did exist between the 
President and the Treasurer. 
However, Brewster later expressed 
regret that his letter had been 
interpreted as a personal attack on 
Ecklund . Ecklund refused to 
;comment on the tone of the 
letter. 

The budget is predicted by the 
University Budget Committee, not 
by the Treasurer himself, and is 
based upon projections made by 
the Budget Department and the 
various University officials in charge 
of budgetary units. Blame for 
incorrect estimates cannot fairly be 
attributed to the inadequacies of 
any individual but rather to the 
system now used to monitor 
Yale's financial situation. 

Some changes have already been 
made in the system. For example, 
the composition of the University 
Budget Committee has been changed 
to include three academic deans in 
order to give better representation 
to Yale's academic sector. In 
addition, it has been suggested that 
the faculty charter include a 
standing committee to monitor the 
financial situation and report period-
ically any changes in the financial 
picture. 

Uncertain as the process of 
economic forecasting seems to be, 
'the University has good reason to 
expect changes in the system that 
will provide the more reliable 
financial figures so important 
to the planning of its future. As 
O'Connor admits, "We could be 
more on top of things." •
