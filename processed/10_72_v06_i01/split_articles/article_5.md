EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the far side of the market, 
Carmen is setting up across from the 
fat-faced boy who is selling his 
mother-in~law's bastmg !llaten als 
for a quarter of a "yaahd--it's a 
dollah-nineteen at Calgon's, I 
•checked it last night." Carmen 
is a flea market professional, a · 
grizzled man with small watery 
eyes and Tony and Lucille's pizza 
stains on his shirt. He sits at the 
center of his long booth, King 
Carmen, with his wife and two 
granddaughters selling sweaters and 
china on his left, a group of 
friends and relatives pushing 
furniture and plumbing equipment 
on his right. 
"I'll give you fifty cents for this." 
An old man points to a threaded 
steel pipe. 
Carmen blinks. "It cosl me more 
than that. That's my life on the 
table, you know." Monkey wrenches, 
pipe fittings, washers, files, saws. 
Carmen claims he is an ex-plumber 
who is too old to climb, and is stuck 
with fifteen years of tools in his 
garage. 
"It ain't worth more than fifty 
cents." 
"All right, take it pop. Joey, get 
the man's money." Life is hard, 
explains Carmen .. He's been losing 
money in this business, people 
stealing left and right. This is the 
last year, he says, before he goes 
on social security. There are rumors 
around the flea market that 
Carmen sometimes finishes the 
day with four or five hundred 
dollars in his pocket. 
" Thank you sir," Joey says. 
"Now, what else can I do you out 
of?" 


Two booths down from Lucky 
Pierre, h is chief understudy, Eddie, 
is selling rings, earrings, bracelets, 
and h airpms. "Buy one, I give you 
one. Hurry up before my boss 
gets back." Lucky Pierre is not 
listening to Eddie, but watching a 
man named "Tiger." Pierre pulls 
a crumpled cigaret from his mouth, 
and waits a moment. Tiger is 
deciding whether to buy a watch-
band; Lucky Pierre has already 
decided. 
"You see the label on the back?" 
Pierre flips a leather watchband and 
shows the gold lettering: Speidel's. 
"You recognize the name? It's 
the best." 
"Well, what. do you want for it?" 
"Three dollars." 
"Christ, I can get it in the store 
for that much." 
"Just a minute, young man. This 
must be your first time here." He 
presses a hand on Tiger's shoulder 
that keeps him from leaving. Pierre 
is good with his hands; he knows 
how to control a man's arm, how 
to direct a woman's hand to the 
bracelet she wants. Lucky Pierre 
looks around, moves closer. "Give 
me a dollar for it," he mutters and 
shoves the watchband in Tiger's 
pocket. Tiger pulls it out, Pierre 
shoves it in, in and out it goes, 
Pierre saying, "Here, I want you 
to have it, I want you to be happy, 
am I allowed to make you happy?" 
By the time he gets his change, 
Tiger is clutching the Speidel 
watchband like a little boy who is 
so pleased With his new toy that 
he is almost embarrassed. 
Lucky Pierre slowly sips his coffee . 
He chats with the woman selling 
clean junk, quality junk, lots 
of good junk, cheap. It's going 
to be a good day. 
Ten o'clock is the time Lucky 
Pierre begins to click. 
" Here we go, here we go," Pierre 
starts off, "this is what I'm really 
going to do. Let me give something 
away." Pierre jumps on the 
counter and flings combs, scotch 
tape, key rings into the crowd. 
"I don't care where I throw it; 
I am entitled to do what I want. 
As I said before, my boss is in 
Florida and I'm here catching _a 
cold. He says, Pierre, advertise 
for. me, give it away, throw it 
away, go crazy." A crowd moves 
in. 
"Now. Who here has enough 
trust in Lucky Pierre to give ten 
cents for a paper bag? It's 
absolutely empty, nothing but air." 
He rips the bag in four pieces and 
throws it in the air. 


"But, I promise you that before 
you leave, that bag will be full of 
cookies." Lucky Pierre stops, 
assesses the crowd. "Okay folks, 
close in now, I need ten bags to be· 
legal." Pierre begins to fill the 
cookie bags with his piles of 
cheap merchandise, hitting all the 
~s with a few items. 
"Okay, ladies and gentleman, how 
many here have the confidence to 
say, Pierre, I will give you a dollar 
and a half for this box?" The crowd 
watches the green and red box; no 
one raises his hand. Pierre stops and 
takes a breath. "Give me a will to 
go on, my friends, a teeny will to 
go on." 
One man takes the chance. Pierre 
puts his hand on the man's shoulder: 
"Open it, young man and tell me 
if you're satisfied. Here it is, ladies 
and gentlemen, a $6.50 boy's shirt. 
And I'll tell you what, here is 
your fifty cents back, I only want 
a dollar. That's for having 
confidence in Lucky Pierre. As 
I said, I go crazy giving things 
away. Here, open your bags, I'm 
going to full your cookie bags. 
Here we go, here we go, here we 
absolutely go."
