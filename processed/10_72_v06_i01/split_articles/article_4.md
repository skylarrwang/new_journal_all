TRUST IN LUCKY PIERRE 
TO GIVE TEN CENTS FOR 
A PAPER BAG?"

Sunday morning, when the stars 
are still clear above Boulevard St., 
Â·Lucky Pierre-the king of the flea 
market--begins to bring all the 
week's work together. About 
6:45, he parks his van in the 
dirt lot behind the Big Buy Food 
Center and walks over to the 
Riverside Cafe to pick up three 
coffees, regular. Back at booth 
505, Lucky Pierre's underlings, 
John and Eddie, pile his merchan-
dise on a counter assembled from 
ping-pong tables and saw horses. 
Wigs, pantihose, magnetic hair 
nets, foam cushion rollers, 
lipsticks, colored yarns, and pony 
tail holders. John is a little 
young so Pierre will have to ex-
plain that the bags for the mer-
chandise must be an arm's 
length from the counter where he 
can grab them without looking 
or breaking the stride of his sales 
pitch. Everything must be at 
Pierre's fingertips; and today, when 
Lucky Pierre is pushing Pro tufted 
toothbrushes for a quarter a piece, 
he will always have a ready sample 
in his back pocket. 

Two hours before Lucky Pierre 
opens up booth 505, the produce 
people--Benny's fruit and vegetable 
boys, the Mascari Bros. wholesale 
bananas, Charlie the chicken man, 
the melon, pumpkin and cantelope 
gang--begin their five-to-five 
selling day. The Italians across from 
Benny always set up first: they 
like to gossip and joke while 
waiting for dawn, sitting around a 
barrel filled with burning crates 
and fruit boxes. As the Ill'St 
customers filter through the 
market, the young Italian son (who 
probably is in line to inherit the 
family business) takes his station 
in front by the fancy peppers, 
sweet com, and escarole. He 
plants a cigaret behind his ear, 
puts on a red hat (a woolen 
hat when it gets cooler) 
and begms his endless chatter--
"Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy 
oh boy, we gaaaht em"--while the 
father in a blue sun hat barks 
"Beauuutiful!" and a relative 
finishes the conversation--"haaa! ta 
la Ia Ia Ia chaaa!" 

Sometimes the family gets into 
food fights with the boys selling 
tomatoes--five pounds for a dollar; 
but most of these fights are 
provoked by one of Benny's boys 
who buys a pound of tomatoes 
and takes the first shots. Benny's 
boys are rarely suspected of 
provocation because they are 
usually selling bushels of Maggio 
Bell peppers and because Benny 
runs a respectable business. In 
fact, Benny ("Hey, what are you 
saying back there") Rabinowitz 
has been working the wholesale 
fruit and vegetable line for 40 
years. He likes to work in a 
maroon sweater, white shirt and 
tie, and talk about the fLISt game 
in the Bowl 58 years ago, when 
Harvard whalloped Yale. 

While Benny is hawking twenty 
oranges for a dollar, and Charlie 
the chicken man is getting rid of 
his weak, unsaleable chickens by 
flinging them in the lagoon for the 
seagulls, the market swells with 
customers. By nine o'clock, the 
New Haven Plaza is crammed with 
several hundred cars. The morning 
prices begin to stabilize: Benny, 
who's got the best deals on peppers 
and citruS. ttuits, forces the prices 
down; the Italians keep the com 
at fifteen ears for a dollar.
