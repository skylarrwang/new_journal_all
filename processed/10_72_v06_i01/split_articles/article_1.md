**Title: Call Them All Ishmael**
**Author:  Joel Krieger**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

Dr. Bruno Bettelheim may be 
the most controversial psychiatrist in America today. His radical 
ideas on treating autistic children, 
which he has implemented for 
almost thirty years as Director of 
the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic 
School in Chicago, have earned 
him lavish praise as well as 
prompted critics to nickname him 
"Dr. No," "Counterspock," and 
"Dr. Brutalheim." Moreover, 
while some liberal professional 
colleagues cringe at his belief that 
extreme student activists are men-
tally ill, many conservative leaders 
have been rushing him to the 
platform. 

In that tradition late last 
month, Yale's Lux et Veritas 
invited Bettelheim to speak in New 
Haven. During'.dinner befor~ the 
address, he applied his "common 
sense" approach in psychology to 
the controversy over Mory's mem-
bership policies. After the aspiring 
lawyers present had analyzed the 
legal points at issue, Bettelheim 
concluded the discussion with the 
offhand remark, "Well, it's nice 
for the men to have a place to get 
together." 

Greg Harris, Director of Lux 
et Veritas, introduced Bettelheim 
to an audience that filled 263 
Street Hall. The 69-year-old 
psychiatrist was born in Vienna, 
imprisoned by the Nazis in 
Buchenwald and Dachau, and 
came to the United States in 1939. 
The speech received sus-
tained applause. Excerpts follow. 

"Call me Ishmael," that is how 
Mo by Dick begins. This makes clear 
that Ishmael was not his true name· 
that his true name was of no mean-' 
ing ~cause he had no true identity, 
and 1t sets the stage for a novel which 
is the story of the struggle for 
gaining an identity. · But "Call me 
Ishmael" told much more at a time 
when everybody was familiar with 
the Bible and its stories. About 
Ishmael, the Bible tells "his hand 
will be against every man and every 
man's hand against him." He is 
the outsider par excellence.


One student activist participated in 
all demonstrations he could, because 
while they lasted it gave him a 
temporary feeling of being together 
with others, thus escaping his desperate 
loneliness and isolation. That is why 
h~ pressed for as many and as pro-
tracted demonstrations and sit-ins as 
he could. All he knew was that these 
activities were extremely important 
and rewarding to him and because of 
this he was convinced that the causes 
they were about were of greatest merit 
Then one day, on one of these marche; 
they were told each one should hold 
somebody's hand. It so happened that 
he found himself without anybody 
holding his. Recalling it in therapy, 
with tears he said, "No one held mind." 


He continued to participate in militant 
activities simply because he did not 
know of any other way to satisfy his 
longing for being close to somebody, 
for somebody holding him by the 
hand. Still, after this experience hE' 
also began to take drugs to escape his 
misery. A relative who had similar 
experiences ~d had been helped by 
psychoanalysiS encouraged him to do 
likewise and he decided to give it a try .... 

The political activities of such persons 
permit them to escape a complete 
paranoid break with reality. By 
interpreting reality in line with their 
paranoid delusions, they are able to 
remain in touch with at least some 
isolated part of the aspects of reality, 
while the support and admiration they 
find for their daring attack on authority 
symbols among their followers is 
another, though most tenuous, contact 
with reality. This is why the first 
mentioned student could seek treat-
ment when he lost this contact when 
nobody was taking hold of his hand. 

Thus embracing extreme positions 
is actually an ego defensive operation, 
which succeeds because the rage and 
violence drains off aggression, which 
otherwise would destroy whatever 
paranoid defenses remained working. 

The quasi or outright delusional 
quality of th~ir beliefs, the inacces-
sibility to debate while loudly 
complaining that nobody listens to 
them, the oversimplification of 
issues, and the preoccupation with 
violence and destruction (the feared 
destruction of themselves, and the 
readiness to embrace ideas of the 
destruction of their enemies) com-
bined with an absence or emotional 
paucity and flatness of human 
relations are typical for these 
persons. Thus the revolt is a 
defense against full fledged paranoia, 
or against being uncontrollably 
swept into anonymous homicide, or 
into suicide. It is usually the result 
of the depressive and compulsive 
obsessive defenses having failed, 
which permitted these students to 
maintain themselves through most 
of their high school or college 
years. Therefore in treatment these 
defenses have to be reestablished 
before, in further treatment, they 
can be replaced by more ego correct 
defenses. 

Thus for them, too, the only 
constructive solution is Melville's: 
that only through a struggle that 
tests our existence to the very core 
can such :· person find his identity. 
The moral struggle, the struggle 
against the elements, the struggle 
with good and evil that stand in 
the center of Melville's novel, 
is in our work replaced by the 
struggle for that self-discovery 
which goes on in psychoanalytic 
treatment. But, as we all know, 
if the avenues for such struggle 
to find oneself are closed, then 
the alternatives of dropping out 
or of violent revolt become very 
tempting. • 


I cannot offer you any deeper 
insight in the origin of student 
revolt than that contained in 
Melville's description of Ishmael's 
state of mind. As you know from 
your own experience, all too many 
of our late adol~cents select to use 
the way out of plStol and ball, that 
is try to evade and escape what to 
them is an unbearable inner con-
flict by dropping out, today ever more 
of~n through the slow suicide of 
usmg LSD or .s~. And even if 
they escape kilhng themselves, they 
destroy th.emselves as aut:onomous 
hum~ bem.gs by embra~mg a 
delusional life of non-existence. 

Others turn their inner violence 
against the outside world, "step out 
into the street" in Melville's words, 
as if he had foreseen our street 
demonstrations; and provoke adult 
father figures who mean nothing to 
them as persons, again as if he had 
foreseen the adolescent propensity 
for confrontations for confronta-
tion's sake. While this. second group 
believes to struggle actively and 
vigorously for their autonomy, they 
destroy it in fact as radically as 
their counterparts who withdraw into 
solipsistic isolation. ·How much they 
are brothers under the skin could be 
seen, for example, in how easily 
they made common cause, for 
example, in Chicago during the 
democratic convention, as on so many 
other occasions. 

In my own work with a small 
number of extreme student activists--
as long as they find easy discharge 
for their inner pressures through 
their acting out, and can fool them-
selves that they have escaped their 
desperate loneliness through the 
admiration of their own crowd, 
they are not likely to subject them-
selves to the rigorous examination 
of their inner motives which is 
implied in psychoanalytic work--as 
soon as they began to take stock of 
themselves, instead of acting out, 
they sunk into deep depression. 
Revolt had indeed berm their substi-
tute for pistol and bail, and seeing 
them in this dE"ep depression, in their 
feeling of hopeless isolation, feeling 
of utter worthlessness and despair, 
one cannot help feeling that, at the 
time, they may have been better off 
revolting, though society certainly 
was not. 

So why do I not let them go on 
with their revolt? Because of their 
own choice. Once they have taken a 
first good look at themselves and 
their ~otives, not a single one in my 
~xpenence wanted to get back to 
their revolt, because they by then 
knew that it did not offer them a way 
to the other, and this is what they 
despe~ately lo_nged for. The immensity 
of therr desparr of ever reaching the 
other is symbolized by their feeling 
that they can reach him only by imt 
having to destroy the entire world. 
Only wh~n the establishment is brought 
down, Wlll they be able, so they believe 
to gain access to the other. Only if 
they realize that through their revolt 
they cannot reach the other do they 
become accessible to ~atment. 

During the past few years Yale 
seems to haue misplaced its penchant 
for critical reflection. Part of the 
problem lies with what is written. 
We notice the Lit has folded. The 
News remains the oldest college 
daily. Things once again seem 
slow around here. The New JDurnal 
will work to draw attention back 
to those matters whose considera-
tion was once commonplace: 
education at Yale, the role of the 
University, the relationship of 
Yale to New Haven, life in the 
community. The Journal returns 
in an attempt to counter the 
monotony of the mainstream and 
to challenge facile analysis and 
creative non-reporting. Join us 
every three weeks, and debate us on 
and off the page.
