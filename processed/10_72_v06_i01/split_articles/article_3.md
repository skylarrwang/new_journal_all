Treasurer, the Comptroller, 
sometimes President Brewster, 
and O'Connor, who is the 
·Committee's chief staff officer. 
'They reviewed the initial findings 
and made their own criticisms and 
emendations. In November, 1970, 
they approved the broad outlines 
of the proposed University 
budget, at which time the various 
deans and operating officers were 
given guidelines for preparing 
their specific budgets. 

Throughout the winter of 1970 
O'Connor held meetings on each 
one of Yale's 400 budgets, 
reviewing with each official the 
estimates for his particular 
budget. Some sessions lasted only 
ten or fifteen minutes, but some of 
the more complicated budgets--
University Treasurer John Ecklund: 
who said he was to blame ? 
like that for the History Department--
required a.day of examination. 
O'Connor's role was far more than 
that of collating budgets from the 
numerous operating departments. 
Often he did not accept the 
estimates that he scrutinized and 
became responsible for making 
reasonable corrections. 

In January 1971, an interim report 
was presented to the Corporation, 
and the deficit was estimated at 
$6.5 million. A final report was 
made in May, and as a result of 
various favorable budget decisions, 
the estimated deficit was reduced 
to $5.7 million, the figure approved 
by the Yale Corporation. The 
deficit is simply the arithmetic 
difference between projected income 
and projected expenses. The 
Corporation was willing to counten-
ance a deficit for the next sever.a1 
years, in the expectation that 
implementation of certain policy 
decisions would create a balanced 
budget by '75-'76. 

But Yale can not absorb yearly 
deficits for very long. Although a 
$650 million endowment cushion 
seems ample, in fact only $37 
million--the University Unrestricted 
Expendable Endowment (UUEE)-
can be used to make up a deficit. 
The remaining millions are 
legally restricted in one way or 
another to certain specific uses-
and paying for a budget deficit 
is not among them. In the last six 
years, $8 million of the Expendible 
Endowment has gone toward 
meeting annual deficits. It becomes 
clear that rising budget deficits 
will not only lessen Yale's future 
income, but soon deplete this 
Endowment, and leave Yale in an 
awkward and unfortunate financial 
position. 

The $5.7 million figure included 
some $1.8 million in contingency 
funds, the largest of which was 
$750,000 for "uncontrollable 
variances." What were the 
contingency funds for? No one 
knew, but everyone felt sure that, 
given the dismal financial 
conditions, the money would be 
needed to cover expenses they 
had not foreseen. The contingency 
funds thus reflected the pessimism 
engendered by the recent deficit 
years, as well as the necessarily 
uncertain nature of budget 
predictions. 

Essentially, the budget is a 
dynamic document. Ecklund 
revised his estimate twice, first in 
January, 1972, when he announced 
to the Corporation a new deficit 
estimate of $5.1 million, with a 
$1.4 million figure for unspent 
contingency funds. This more 
optimistic prediction was based 
on the occurrence of events that 
could not have been foreseen 
earlier and on positive actions 
taken during the year to alleviate 
the crisis. In May, 1972, Ecklund 
made a second estimate of $4.6 
million, with $1 million in 
contingency funds still unspent. 
So at this point the estimated 
absolute deficit was $3.6 million. 

Sometime in late August 1972, 
the Budget Office calculated the 
actual University operating deficit 
.. at $1.2 million. The figure was 
reported to President Brewster 
shortly afterward. In his letter to 
Prouost Richard Cooper: he explained it all. 
4/The New Journal/October 30, 1972 
the Fellows of the Yale Cor{1oration 
September 8, Brewster wrote: 
With mixed emotions I recently 
received surprising news from the 
Treasurer's Office. Instead of the 
five million seven hundred thousand 
dollar deficit for.: 1971-72 which 
was approved a year ago last June 
by the Corporation, the actual 
figure is approximately 011e million 
dollars. 

Brewster's letter went on to praise 
Yale administrators for their work 
in implementing budget cuts around 
the University. But he also expressed 
displeasure at the discrepancy 
between the predicted and actual 
budgets: "The surprising divergence 
of estimates and performance does 
pose a danger that no future 
forecasts will be believed; and that 
there will be continued skepbcism 
about the adequacy ot the 
information about where we stand 
financially at any given time." 

In response to that "danger" and 
possible "skepticism" Brewster 
appointed Provost Richard N. Cooper 
to undertake an investigation of 
the deficit discrepancy. He also 
reported the deficit surprise to 
the Summer Study Committee 
chaired by Professors Blum and 
Pelikan. The Study Committee had 
been considering possible ways to 
balance the University budget 
through calendar reform and cuts in 
the academic and non-academic 
sides of the University. Now they had 
to revise their suggestions to meet 
the implications of the deficit 
revelation. 

Even if the Treasurer's Office 
revised its estimate in May 1972 to 
$4.6 million with an extra million in 
unused contingencies, the question 
remains: what caused the discrepancy 
between the May figures and the 
actual deficit? This is one of the 
matters Provost Cooper discussed in 
a report to the President dated 
October 9. His report suggested 
that "the discrepancy between budgeted 
and actual results for 1971-72 was 
·due to a wide variety of factors, 
each of which requires its own 
t!Xplanation, rather than to any single 
factor." 

Budget Director U '()onrtor: 
"We could be more on top of things." 



In this way the Provost's Report 
attributed the discrepancy both to 
unforeseen changes in the operating 
budget, and to a pessimistic bias in 
projection due to past economic 
conditions. But what caused these 
unforeseen changes? Why weren't 
they caught and reported earlier? 

One reason is the University's 
cash-accounting system, an 
accounting method used by most 
universities because most 
t- · universities have tended to use it. 
According to Comptroller Albert 
Buesking, the man second-in-
command to Ecklund, that is the 
only reason Yale uses the cash-
accounting rather than the 
accrual accounting system, 
favored by most large businesses. 

In cash-accounting, a debt 
becomes fiscally real only 
when there is a cash outlay to pay 
it, not when the debt is incurred. 
Until a bill is paid , Yale's central 
budgeting department does not 
even know it exists. Thus the 
University's books may present a 
deceptive picture of financial 
health only because a backlog of 
paperwork in various departments 
has prevented certain bills from 
being paid. 

In the accrual system, a debt 
is recorded as soon as it is 
incurred. The organization has an 
accurate picture of its true financial 
condition all the time. According 
to Buesking, discussions have been 
under way for several years 
about how to change Yale's account-
ing to the accrual system, and that 
ultimately the University will 
make the switch. At the 
October 14 Corporation meeting, 
the Trustees urged the University 
to institute those changes. This 
reform will help University officials 
keep better track of the actual 
course of expenditures and income 
throughout the year. 

In any case, how accurate can 
University budget estimates be? 
"No one expects on-target fore-
casting" a year in advance of a 
$130 million budget, admits 
Kingman Brewster, but hardly any om 
understood just how tentative the 
$5.7 million figure actually could 
be. The financial officials knew 
that the figure was, in effect, only 
a best first guess, even though it 
was the approved "official figure," 
rendered imprecise by a host of 
factors. 

The Cooper Report was necessary 
to detail such factors, because they 
had not been explained at the 
appropriate time--when the figure 
was announced. Ecklund later 
pointed out that government 
budgets consider a five per cent 
margin of error acceptable, and that 
the Yale estimate was only off by 
$4.5 million out of $130 million. 

Later, however, Blum said that 
the committee did not use the $5.7 
million figure as a "hard" figure, but 
rather as an estimate of the magnitude 
of the problem.
