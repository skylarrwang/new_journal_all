The Dahl Report was not the first ... 
(continued from page 9) 
At that time Yale students were 
graded on a 60-100 scale, and Dean's 
List, percentile ranking, and sundry 
honors were conferred on the basis 
of grade-point average. Several 
incidents finally crystallized 
the almost universal student 
opposition to what was seen as an 
unjustified and pretentiously precise 
system. A 600-person lecture 
course taught by Margaret Mead 
had a class average of 88, ten points 
higher than the Yale 'college average, 
a circumstance which occasioned 
much self-righteous envy among 
those not enrolled. When a 
sociology seminar voted to turn 
in grades of Satisfactory and 
Unsatisfactory, and the 
department balked at the propriety 
of such a grading scheme, the 
professor then reported a grade 
of 100 for each·student. The Yale 
College Dean, refusing to accept 
these grades, argued that they were 
not "credible" to the faculty. 
General disgust with all grades rose 
when it was rumored that the 
Selective Service System would use 
class rank in determining defer-
ments. 

The Yale Daily News exercised 
unexpected leadership in focusing 
student attention on grades. Although 
the SAB and the Student Committee 
on Teaching recommended 
moderate revision of grades to an 
eight-point letter system, the 
Course of Study Committee 
startled many students by proposing 
and gaining faculty approval for 
a four-point Honors, High Pass, Pass, 
Fait system, in effect until this year. 
ln 1967-68 student participation 
increased, inspired by the dramatic 
changes of previous years. As a result 
of pressure from the Student 
Committee on Teaching and the 
Council of Masters, an all-faculty 
committee was appointed to reassess 
the educational potential of the 
residential colleges. Attention 
focused on the "sophomore seminars," 
created in 1952 by a gift from 
Paul Mellon, and which were then 
being used by large departmental 
courses as discussion groups for 
underclassmen. Meanwhile, some 
colleges, resenting the departmental 
exploitation of college resources, 
began giving student-initiated 
non-credit seminars on subjects like 
" Race, Riot, and Poverty." 

The spring of 1969 saw the most 
complete expression of participation 
and alternative at Yale, in the form of 
the Coalition for a New University, a 
movement for radical reform within 
the University. CNU was also the best 
organized student movement 'Yale has 
ever seen. Growing out of a c1ty 
planning seminar on institutional 
change, CNU evolved through weekly 
meetings of undergraduates and 
graduate students, and concerned 
itself with a broad spectrum of Yale 
issues: use of space and architecture, 
the relationship of the University to 
New Haven, quality of teaching, 
college as a community of more than 
scholars and students. It discusses 
the need for attracting more 
"creative types" into the teaching 
and student body and faculty. 
CNU provided an umbrella publica-
tion for articles by individuals and 
groups as diverse as Masters and Yale 
SDS. In addition, it held a four day 
workshop on educational issues at 
Yale in which over half the university 
student population participated in 
one form or another. 
Three key issues emerged from 
CNU's inquiries: access to information, 
participation by students and non-
faculty in govenlance, and the need for 
opportunities for coherent personal 
development in undergraduate educa-
tion. Unfortunately, consideration 
of these rna tters has been side-
tracked in the last few years. 

The advent of coeducation dis-
tracted attention and absorbed 
en~rgy away from the broader 
movement for change. The pres-
ence of "sufficient" women 
somehow came to represent the 
problem of wholeness and commun-
ity at Yale. In addition, the 
lengthy and cumbersome deliber-
ations of the Governance Commis-
sion successfully killed most 
student desire and entp_U$iasm for 
participation in the tedious, 
bureaucratic process of governance 
at Yale. The Governance 
Commission itself proved a crowning 
irony tO the high hopes of the Coalition 
Coalition: rather than creating a 
mechanism for decision-making, 
the CNU had created a commission 
that took two years to study the 
problem before reporting. 

The belief in mass, participatory 
democracy lost broad support 
through its association with the 
Yale-Panther events of spring 1970. 
Student participation on faculty 
~mmittees lost its appeal to 
all but a dedicated and unrepresen-
tative few, and even then general 
interest was commensurately 
weakened. 

Thus, when the Study Group on 
the Future of Yale--the Dahl 
Committee--spent last year con-
sulting the community on their 
complaints and visions of Yale, 
student concern was moderate and 
restrained· in comparison to the 
level of interest years ago. A small 
group of students did meet 
regularly and issue several policy 
reports--for the most part ignored-
to the Dahl Committee, but their 
activities not only had little 
impact but were virtually unknown 
by other concerned students. 

Presumably, the recommendations 
of the Dahl Report will be considered 
by the faculty and its committees 
this year, unless the temporary 
faculty committee appointee over 
the summer to evaluate the 
financial implications of the Report--
puts further consideration out of the 
question. 

In many ways, the Dahl Report 
responds to questions raised by the 
CNU. For the first time, a faculty 
report has seriously considered the 
need for attracting more 
women, and "poets and playwrights" 
into the student body and faculty. 
It recommends the improved use of 
space at Yale to ease the social flow. 
It urges more creative use of existing 
space, within and outside the 
residential colleges. 

The committee's Hall report 
is also threatening. Optional 
programs with limited an~ pref-
erential admissions are subject to 
greater departmental and faculty 
supervil;ion than 1,000 alternative 
courses of study. 
According to the program,.students 
will participate in freshman seminars 
in their major area of inter..est 
and confront questions of 
educational as well as personal de-
velopment. More impo~t, each 
student will design his own program 
of study, without externally 
imposed degree requirements, 
but with the advice a1id approval of 
a Board of Mentors, or faculty 
advisors, within each college. 

In the mentorship program-the 
major educational proposal, and 
in a sense, the key to the whole 
report--it responds boldly to 
the need expressed for "self-defin-
ition of goals, and for tJ:l~ ~e~~l-. 
opment of "moral capabilities With 
which to face a "d~sorienting society." 
Twenty years later, the likeli-
hood seems great that the events 
of 1952 will be repeated. 

The original proposal, instructors 
needed only the approval of a small 
faculty Committee on Teaching in 
one of the residential colleges, but 
this procedure met with substantial 
faculty opposition. The faculty 
amended the program to require all 
seminar instructors to have or obtain 
at least temporary departmental 
appointment, and ruled that college 
seminars had to be approved not 
only by the special Committee but 
also by the Course of Study 
Committee. Now, many college 
seminars function merely as addi-
tional course options to regular de-
partmental programs. 

By 1968 the SAB had succeeded 
in obtaining faculty approval of 
voting student representatives on the 
major faculty committees. 
Moreover, a strengthened belief in 
the value of and necessity for student-
initiated participation was reflected 
in several changes in the SAB itself. 
Its members were once again 
elected, it increased .its membership 
to include juniors, and it began to 
write pamphlets to fellow students 
rather than faculty ~ommittees. 
The SAB started issuing "Guide to 
Yale," written by Derek Shearer, and 
advocating the loophole approach to 
Yale's education: "Learn the 
tricks and you can do whatever you 
want here." The immediate success 
of the student-initiated coeducation 
drive, singlehanqedly engineered and 
foisted on a reluctant administration 
by student Avi Soiffer in the fall of 
1968, created an upsurge in student 
confidence and desire to change Yale. 
Almost anything seemed possible. 
16/The New Journal/October 30, 1972 


The possibility of a dramatic increase in non-departmental majors 
is threatening, especially to 
smaller departments. The elim-
ination of existing "special 
programs"--such as Directed Studies, 
Early Concentration, the Five Year 
B.A. and Scholar of the House--
provided for a well-endowed program 
of seminars, originating in the 
suggestion, on subjects not available 
in standard departmental offerings. 
This proposal created a truly 
alternative system in which any student 
with an idea and a desire to learn 
could initiate a credit-bearing course, 
taught by any qualified individual 
in or outside of Yale College. 

Yet it is unclear exactly what the 
mentorship program is designed to 
accomplish. If its purpose is to 
provide a more rigorous and 
individualized program of purely 
academic instruction, it is difficult 
to see in what way it is an improve-
ment on the present relatively 
ineffective program. If, on the other 
hand, its purpose is to provide a 
structure within which students can 
establish the kind of relationship 
with an older "guide" that will 
give direction to the search for self-
definition, at the same time 
providing the advisor with the kind 
of personal knowledge helpful in 
deciding what the most productive 
learning experiences are for 
individual students, then it is unclear 
that fifteen willing faculty members 
per college can be found who are 
capable of making the kind of 
commitment this would entail. 

It seems possible that students will 
look on this program as an infringe-
ment of their freedom to, in Dahl's 
terms, "treat college as a cafeteria, 
where the courses are chosen hap-
hazardly on the basis of taste and 
willingness to pay or work for the 
student," rather than as a meaning-
ful elaboration of that freedom. 

Yet, even if one were to grant that 
the mentorship program is a 
substantive and potentially liberating 
alternative to the existing 
bureaucracy, the chances are great 
that it will never be implemented. 
Insofar as it might encourage and 
permit a student to fashion a non-
departmental or perhaps non-academic 
course of study, and insofar as it would 
insist that students take the primary 
responsibility for deciding what is 
worth learning, the mentorship program 
represents too great a departure for 
the faculty to support.
