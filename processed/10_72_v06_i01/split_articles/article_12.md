President has about winning the 
game. He had more assurance, per-
sonally, than this President. But the 
Vietnamese had suffered much had 
been so disappointed over Gen~va, 
that they were just as arbitrary as 
th~y could be. And that was a great 
mistake from their own point of 
view, for they could have had this 
war over a long time ago." 

Fulbright is steadfast in his 
opposition to present Administration 
policies. He has concluded that they 
want to maintain a pre-eminent 
American presence in Southeast Asia. 
"I don't think the people knew in 
1968 or know now what is in 
the mind of the President--and it's not a 
policy of disengagement. Vietnamization 
means control by proxy." 

The first step would be an 
end to the Vietnam war, ended 
the way the French ended their 
war-with a conference. We would 
accept a mixed government, includ-
ing communists, and we would 
not attempt to maintain a major US 
position in Southeast Asia. 

Fulbright would shift away from 
what he describes as America's 
"great power militariam." This 
would involve both the rejection of 
military responses to political 
problems, and a substantial reduc-
tion in US bases and commitments 
abroad. He would also avoid new 
commitments like those the 
Administration is now negotiating 
with the Portuguese and Greek 
dictatorships for bases in Athens 
and the Azores. 

He would revert to a •policy of 
non-intervention. No more military 
and CIA involvements as occurred 
in Greece and the Dominican 
Republic. No more public funds for 
private organizations like Radio Free 
Europe. No longer a free hand to 
the Pentagon propagandists within 
our own country. 

He would continue to pursue 
the ~etente with Russia and C:hina, 
lookmg for areas of common mterest 
and possible cooperation. (Fultiright 
has applauded the President's 
efforts in these directions. After the 
China trip, he wrote Nixon, 
congratulating him and pledging his 
full support. No reply came from the 
President.) As much international 
tension as possible, including the 
Middle East powder keg, would be 
moved inside a revived UN. And 
foreign aid would be redirected 
from military assistance towards 
developmental projects. 

Finally, he would attempt two 
crucial changes in foreign policy 
practices. First, believing that the 
"cult of the strong Presidency" has 
created a crisis-oriented Presidential 
dictatorship in foreign policy, he 
would try to restore Congress' 
Constitutional role in declaring war, 
making treaties, and advising the 
President. "The American 
Congress is indeed a slow-moving 
and sometimes inefficient body," 
he observed last year, "but to 
those of us who have developed an 
appreciation of the capacity of 
people in high places for doing 
stupid things, there is much to be 
said for institutionai processes · 
which compel people to think things 
over before plunging into action."

Someone might prepare a speech tor

Yet they differ in fundamental 
premises. Kissinger's balance of power 
assumes that struggle and war are the 
natural order on the world scene.

Obviously, Fulbright is not an 
isolationist. But he is also not an in-

school of the Deans (Acheson and 
Rusk) or in the managerial school of 
the Princes (Metternich and Bismarck).
