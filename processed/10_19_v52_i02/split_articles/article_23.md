Elicker has an instinct for collaboration. “The 
way I’ve learned how to make those decisions 
in life in general is to incorporate other people 
who I trust,” he said. “I don’t think one person 
is ever good at making all the best decisions.” 
Part of the shift in Elicker’s appeal from 2013 to 
2019 is that he surrounded himself with a more 
diverse campaign team. “It was important to get 
leadership from many different backgrounds to 
be visibly part of the campaign,” he said, “both to 
guide some decisions on the campaign, but also to 
show the city that our campaign was inclusive of 
many people, and prioritize that.” 


Elicker’s consciousness of the ways his whiteness 
has shaped his candidacy takes various forms. At 
worst, he seems prone to tokenizing the people 
around him. At best, his reflections encourage him 
to engage more humbly and more intentionally 
with the city. 


“My administration will be really accessible,” 
he said with a hopeful smile. “A lot of people want 
to be listened to and want to be heard.”


Elicker proved throughout the 2019 campaign 
his chameleonic skill of shifting tactics in order 
to meet the expectations of the city he hopes to 
govern. He recognizes his blind spots. He pays 
attention to what New Haveners tell him they 
need, and incorporates their conversations into 
his platform. How he’ll transition into office, if 
elected, remains to be seen. “I think being mayor 
is a constant campaign,” Elicker told me. He’s 
been working to win the trust of New Haveners 
over the last six years; perhaps, come January, 
we’ll be seeing more front-facing iPhone videos 
and hearing more of his knocks on our doors.
