n the wall of Howard K. Hill’s 
office hangs a framed poster with a 
quote that begins: “THE FUNERAL 
helps confirm the reality and finality of death.” 
But while Hill owns a funeral home, he doesn’t 
just serve people at burial time. He encourages 
people “to prepare not just for death, but to 
prepare for life.” 

Howard K. Hill Funeral Services first opened 
its doors in 2004. Fifteen years and two new 
branches later, Hill is well-established in the 
business. “As a funeral director, you have to 
entrench yourself in community in order to 
remain relevant,” he told me, settled in a high-
backed leather chair. Hill wears elegant suits, 
has a shiny bald head, and maintains a thin, neat 
mustache. He talks slowly and evenly, and moves 
with practiced calm. Glass plaques on a table 
in his office commend his leadership, and one 
declares him Humanitarian of the Year. 

Hill bought his Chapel Street building—a 
three-story, nineteenth-century house with a 
red awning—from Monahan, Cox, Smith, & 
Crimmins Funeral Home, which has since 
migrated to Wooster Square. Hill said the 
business 
moved 
“because 
the 
population 
shifted.” According to Hill, his predecessors 
served mostly Italian and Irish families and left 
the neighborhood when their clients did. Today, 
many of Hill’s neighbors are Yale-affiliated 
renters who don’t bring much business. “Yale 
clientele are not necessarily dying; they’re not 
necessarily from here; and they come here very 
temporarily,” he said. 

Most of Hill’s clients are black families who 
attend church in the surrounding Dwight 
neighborhood. “They may live out in the 
suburbs, but they come to church here,” said 
Hill, who participates in church events. “So 
when something happens, they know me.” He 
emphasized that segregation in the funeral 
business is by no means organic—his difficulty 
attracting white customers has deep roots in 
historic prejudice. While white funeral directors 
have been able to “serve the black community 
with ease,” Hill has had difficulty expanding 
his client base. “Do I want to serve in other 
communities, white communities? Absolutely I 
do. I’m a business person,” he said. 

Hill pointed out Gerry Brown, an older white 
man and funeral director. Hill hired Brown 
about ten years ago “for the specific reason” of 
developing stronger ties to New Haven’s white 
population. “It was in my original business plan 
that I want to be the first African American 
funeral home that routinely serves in white 
communities,” he said. “It still hasn’t worked.” 

Brown remains involved in community 
outreach. He helps host death preparedness 
“seminars” at churches, community centers, and 
senior centers, assisting families with funeral 
arrangements in advance of any deaths.

Hill sees his limited market as a symptom of 
the challenges that black-owned businesses 
encounter. 

Following 
legally 
mandated 
integration, many black-owned businesses were 
wiped out by their white-owned counterparts, and 
these businesses are again in decline, Hill said. 

In 2014, his concern about this trend prompted 
him to found the Black Business Alliance, which 
coordinates networking, training, and technical 
assistance for black entrepreneurs in New 
Haven, Hartford, and Fairfield counties. 

Early in his career, Hill noticed that many 
families struggled to cover funeral costs. He 
integrated financial advice into his funeral 
consultations, speaking about savings and 
investments, life insurance, and how to preserve 
wealth across generations. He often buries 
multiple family members, so he tries to help 
people make financial plans from one funeral to 
the next. 

Hill even hired one former client, and later 
helped her start her own business. After Sandra 
Watts, the daughter of a woman Hill had buried, 
lost her job, Hill hired her as the funeral home’s 
chaplain. It was her job to provide mourners with 
emotional support. At Hill’s encouragement, 
she also arranged flowers in the funeral home’s 
basement. When a local florist wanted to sell their 
shop to Hill, he signed the lease on Watts’s behalf. 
Watts had never owned a business before, but she 
“trusted [Hill] because he was proof that it could 
be done.” Now, she has a storefront on Shelton 
Avenue in New Haven, and another space on 
Dixwell Avenue in Hamden. Her shop is called 
Remember the Lilies, after her mother, Lily. 

Moved by the financial insecurity he witnessed 
in his customers, Hill started a fund to help cover 
end-of-life ceremonies. This organization, now 
called The Prosperity Foundation, evolved to 
support organizations that serve Connecticut’s 
black community with services that include college 
and career preparation, culinary education, and 
support for people experiencing homelessness. 

As he supports other black businesses and 
organizations, Hill is also expanding his own 
franchise. In addition to existing locations in 
Hartford and Bloomfield, he is purchasing 
another funeral home in New Britain. He wants 
his branches not only to provide services for the 
dead but to spur economic prosperity among the 
living. In Hartford, for example, he is advocating 
to redevelop the area around his funeral home as 
a shopping district for the local community. “This 
is my community change model,” he said. “It’s 
reserved specifically to impact black communities, 
starting with an aggressive funeral director.” As 
Hill models it, this “aggressive funeral director” 
is someone who is determined to make change—
someone who leverages the business of death in 
order to enhance community life.
