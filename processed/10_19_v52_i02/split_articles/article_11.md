stuck in the shadow
she rests and plays  
dutifully trudging forward
she rests again
tilts her head and listens
     la da da, doom doom! 
he is captivating
and she has nearly missed her cue
she journeys onward, driving up crescendos into chords
when he gets lost in trill, she grabs him by the hand 
and pulls him to his feet
it has always been this way 	
what way?
	
a marriage?
	
a friendship? 
	
a partnership?
sometimes they touch in the middle
but it is fleeting and he is first to leave, scaling back upward
to melodies she could only dream of and applause that drowns her out
still she listens thoughtfully
and watches carefully
and waits for her turn.
