t’s Wednesday night and DJ Commander 
plays the music loud. I’m at the Elks Lodge on 
Dixwell, where Mayor Toni Harp’s supporters 
are hosting an appreciation day to celebrate 
her legacy in New Haven. Harp is scheduled to 
attend, but she hasn’t arrived yet. R&B floods the 
room, and people greet each other, hug, laugh. 
The room keeps filling up. Then I hear some 
scattered applause from the hallway outside the 
room. The applause spreads inside, and suddenly 
everyone is cheering. “Toni, Toni, Toni,” they 
chant. Harp enters wearing a black blazer and 
waves to the crowded room. Over the speakers, DJ 
Commander says, “Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor 
Harp!” The room goes crazy.

Two weeks earlier, Harp had suspended her 
mayoral reelection campaign after losing the 
Democratic primary to Justin Elicker. But tonight, 
she’s trying to rally the energy of the room, forcing 
her voice to be animated as she reminisces about 
her successes. Reading from a script, Harp recounts 
how she removed a controversial fence between 
New Haven and Hamden, revitalized the Long 
Wharf food trucks, restored College Street Music 
Hall, balanced New Haven’s budget, improved 
graduation rates, and reduced crime. Then she 
says, “I just want you to know that I am still on the 
ballot.” The audience erupts into applause, and 
then more chants of “Toni, Toni, Toni…” One 
man yells, “Don’t give it up!”

 Harp grew up in Salt Lake City. She was the 
only black student in her middle school, and in 
her high school she was one of thirty in a class of 
600. According to the CT Mirror, she said in 2013 
that she “saw mistreatment as an African-American 
child in Utah.” She “realized that people mistreat 
people. And you have to rise above it.”

 In 1974, Harp graduated from Yale with a 
Master’s in Environmental Design. She became 
an alder for the Dwight neighborhood, then a 
state senator for twenty years. In 2013, she defeated 
Justin Elicker in New Haven’s mayoral election. It 
was the first time a woman had become mayor of 
the Elm City, and the second time a black person 
had. Over the next six years, unemployment 
in New Haven dropped 50 percent and crime 
dropped to its lowest point in fifty years. High 
school graduation rates increased, and so did 
affordable housing. Harp won in 2015 and 2017 
without much opposition.

And then, this September, she lost. Elicker took 
more than 58 percent of the votes in the primary. 
Harp suspended her campaign but decided to stay 
on the ballot for the general election on November 
5. It was her first loss ever as a politician, and it was 
to an opponent she had beaten six years ago, whose 
experience consisted of two terms as an alder and 
who led a nonprofit of five full-time employees.

The mood was more somber when I met Harp 
in her office at City Hall. She seemed sad. When 
she spoke, she looked around the room and rarely 
into my eyes. Harp is seventy-two years old. Her 
hair is a rich dark brown that verges on black, and 
it falls snugly around her head and onto her ears. 
I asked her why she thought she lost. “It’s hard 
to say,” she said. Her voice was quiet and slow. “I 
don’t really know.”

Harp did say, vaguely, that some voters had 
concerns with her administration. That’s true. 
The first signs of concern came in 2017, during 
the tortured process of hiring Carol Birks, a 
controversial candidate, as superintendent. Harp 
cast a deciding vote in Birks’s election at a Board 
of Education meeting where, according to the 
New Haven Independent, students walked out 
in protest, audience members stood with duct 
tape over their mouths, and one board member 
challenged another to a “duel.”

Then in 2018, Harp raised taxes by 11 percent 
to compensate for reduced state funding. And in 
November of that year, her administration relaxed 
lead paint inspection regulations so that the city 
would only be required to inspect the homes of 
children with at least fifteen micrograms per 
deciliter of lead in their bloodstream, rather than 
the previous, stricter standard of five micrograms. 
Since May, the city has faced a class-action lawsuit 
representing around three hundred children 
who could be harmed by the regulations. And in 
June, the FBI subpoenaed records from the Harp 
administration, apparently to investigate its use of 
public funds. So far, the FBI hasn’t released any 
findings.

Elicker cited many of these events in campaign 
ads. He accused Harp of “corruption and 
mismanagement” after the FBI probe. He blamed 
her for the lead poisoning of three hundred 
children, and he even attempted to link her to a 
mass K2 overdose on the New Haven Green in 
2018.


Harp’s supporters refute these allegations. 
Jeannette Morrison, the President Pro Tempore 
of the New Haven Board of Alders, where she 
represents Ward 22, noted that the fact that the 
FBI is investigating an administration doesn’t 
mean that the administration is guilty. Former 
Harp debate advisor Alex Taubes told me that 
Harp had to prioritize the most severe cases of lead 
poisoning first because the city didn’t have enough 
inspectors. And Harp herself pointed out that New 
Haven’s emergency services actually won awards 
for their response to the 2018 overdoses.

Taubes and I are sitting on a bench in the 
backyard of Koffee. He’s wearing a suit without 
a tie, and his fine hair is streaked with gray. He 
speaks with passion but without hurry, lingering 
on his words when he likes them, gesturing with 
his hands, and leaning back on the bench with his 
eyes closed. Taubes says that Elicker’s campaign 
engaged in “character assassination” and got away 
with it because Harp is a black woman. Elicker 
employed the “stereotype of the corrupt black 
mayor,” Taubes asserts. “He turned her into a 
caricature.” When Taubes speaks of Harp he 
seems to be in awe. He describes her prodigious 
knowledge of policy and how she tries to hide that 
knowledge so as not to alienate voters. “She could 
be on Ezra Klein’s podcast,” Taubes says. “It’s why 
she gets so much done. She’s a policy wonk, 100 
percent.”

I asked Morrison, at her desk at City Hall, if 
Elicker had attacked Harp’s character unfairly. 
“Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes,” she said. She wore a jean 
jacket and hoop earring, and she swatted at a 
mosquito while we talked. Elicker “definitely” 
treated Harp differently because she is a black 
woman, Morrison said. She claimed that Elicker 
wouldn’t accuse a white man of corruption and 
mismanagement without solid evidence.

Harp supporters don’t mention that her campaign 
used plenty of attack ads, too. One flyer compared 
Elicker to President Trump, accusing both of 
“overconfidence and incompetence.” A television 
ad warned that Elicker planned to use drones 
to spy on New Haven residents. Harp’s former 
campaign manager, Ed Corey, even claimed that 
Elicker’s wife, Natalie, used her influence as an 
assistant U.S. attorney to have the FBI subpoena 
the Harp administration. Harp’s campaign called 
it a “political hit job.” Later, on a WNPR radio 
show, Harp admitted that her campaign’s attack 
on Natalie Elicker was “ill-advised ”and promised 
not to target Elicker’s family again.

Elicker and his campaign “started putting all 
this doubt in the minds of people, and so a lot of 
people just didn’t come out and vote,” Morrison 
said. She claimed that Harp isn’t corrupt. “She’s 
made mistakes,” Morrison said. “But she’s human; 
she’s supposed to make mistakes.”


Back at Elks Lodge, Harp approaches a group of 
reporters for a statement. One reporter asks about 
her prospects for reelection. “If people want to 
vote for me they certainly can,” she says, almost 
defiantly. “If you want me to be your mayor you’ve 
got to vote for me. I’ve done my job.”

The tables are almost full, and people eat 
fruit salad and meatballs from disposable plates. 
At every seat is a flier. “The People’s Campaign 
to Re-Elect Toni Harp,” each reads, alongside a 
photo of Harp at her desk. “Vote November 5.”

Emma Jones, a prominent activist who fought 
for New Haven’s recently established Civilian 
Review Board, is here at Elks Lodge. She is the 
mother of Malik Jones, a young black man who 
was shot and killed by an East Haven police officer 
in 1997. After Harp’s primary loss, she and Taubes 
created the People’s Campaign for Toni Harp, a 
group of Harp supporters devoted to getting her 
reelected in November. As of October 12, its 
Facebook page had 308 members. Most of the 
posts are ebullient stories about what Mayor Harp 
has accomplished. One post, by Taubes, reads: 
“You Got The Lies. Now For The Truth,” along 
with a list of Harp’s accomplishments. Taubes told 
me that the group organizes phone banking and 
door-to-door canvassing. “We don’t have money,” 
he said, “but we want to let [Mayor Harp] know 
that you don’t need money if you have people.”
