Jones spoke to me with passion, and she 
emphasized her points by pounding one fist 
into her open hand. Harp was blamed for things 
that white mayors weren’t, she said—like lead 
poisoning, which has been a problem for decades. 
“I don’t like it, and I have an obligation and a 
responsibility to stand up and say, ‘No. That’s not 
right,’” Jones said. The People’s Campaign fulfills 
that obligation. “I want to educate people, so that 
people have the real truth,” she said. “Let’s talk 
about this woman’s record.”
“Do you know how big it is that we don’t have to 
wake up and see there’s been another shooting in 
a high school community?” Jones added.

She was talking about YouthStat, a program 
designed to intervene with young people who are 
at risk of dying from gang violence. According 
to the CT Mirror, at least two young people 
were shot down on the streets within Harp’s first 
hundred days as mayor. So Harp brought together 
superintendents, principals, police officers, fire 
chiefs, and other professionals. They came up with 
criteria—grades, graduation, attendance, criminal 
history—for identifying the kids who were most at 
risk. Then they developed an electronic system to 
allow parents, social workers, teachers, and other 
adults to coordinate with each other to help the 
kids stay engaged in school. The resulting program 
was YouthStat, and since its creation in 2014, Harp 
told me, “We haven’t lost a kid.”

Harp seems torn about letting go. She told me 
she stayed on the ballot because she wanted to 
honor the Working Families Party’s nomination 
and give people another chance to vote for her. 
“So many people who said they didn’t vote in 
September thought that the real election was in 
November,” she said. “So I wanted them to have 
an opportunity to either vote for me or vote for my 
opponent.”

But if she wants to give voters another chance, 
why not actively campaign? Her voice gained 
momentum as she told me that Elicker’s primary 
run was full of malice and viciousness. She didn’t 
want to go through more of it.
“He smeared me, smeared my administration—
the people who work hard on behalf of the people 
of New Haven every day—and it was undeserved,” 
she said. “I wasn’t going to be a part of allowing 
that to continue.”

Harp didn’t say that Elicker ran a racist or a 
sexist campaign. “I’m sure that men are attacked 
too,” she said. But she also said she had never 
seen anything in New Haven politics as vicious 
as Elicker’s campaign. “And I do happen to be 
a woman and an African-American, so I don’t 
know what his motive was, other than to win,” 
she said.
 Elicker’s campaign strategy seems to have 
worked. Sure, Harp doesn’t want to put herself 
through another round of his attacks. But maybe 
it’s also true that Harp won’t campaign because 
a part of her knows it won’t change the results of 
the general. Has she already let go?

Many of Harp’s supporters say they’re 
uncertain what would happen to New Haven 
without Harp as mayor. I asked Morrison how 
the city might change: “That is the biggest 
question that I have,” she said. She praised Harp 
for supporting the new Q House, a community 
center in Dixwell that opened in 1924 and shut 
down in 2003. Harp helped secure funding for 
a reopening of the center in 2020. “I am just so 
thankful to Mayor Harp for making Dixwell a 
priority,” Morrison said.

And Shaleah Williams, the YouthStat program 
coordinator, claimed that YouthStat was possible 
only because of Harp. “YouthStat is her baby, so 
to speak,” she said. She told me about a student 
who was disengaged from school because he 
needed glasses but didn’t have the means to 
get them. At a meeting, the school nurse told 
officials about the student’s situation. YouthStat 
assigned him a case manager, who spent almost 
“He smeared me, smeared 
my administration—the 
people who work hard on 
behalf of the people of 
New Haven every day—and 
it was undeserved.”

two months helping him. The case manager took 
him to an eye doctor, got a prescription, and let 
him choose his frames. After that, Williams said, 
the student engaged more in school, and his 
grades improved.

Williams, like Morrison, is apprehensive 
about the prospect of Harp’s departure. Harp 
“understands the youth in this city and what’s 
necessary to help them along,” Williams said. She 
worries that new mayors won’t “have the heart that 
she does.”

This might be Harp’s last term as mayor, but 
YouthStat and the Q House will outlast her. And 
maybe it’s some consolation to her supporters 
that institutions like these will live on as proof of 
Harp’s time in this city.

But what will Harp do if she isn’t mayor next 
term? She’s not quite sure. “I may do some of what 
you’re doing,” she told me. “I may write—memoirs 
or something—and it may be helpful to people.”

Harp seemed surprised—or maybe relieved—
when I brought up her free time. She talked 
faster, unburdened by the thought of how her 
words might be used against her. I asked if she 
saw her children much. “My daughter lives with 
me, so I see her every day.” She laughed, one of 
the few times in our interview. “And that’s my first 
grandchild right there. He just turned a year and 
a half.” She pointed to a photograph on her office 
wall.

On Sundays she goes to Center Church on the 
Green with her daughters. She’s a member of 
groups that help “the city’s neediest.” She has two 
dogs, Ella and Cece, and she plays with them in 
her backyard twice a day. “So, you know, I have 
things to do with my time,” she said. And she 
laughed again, briefly.

THE CHALLENGER
A 
few decades before Justin Elicker 
decided to run for mayor of New Haven, 
he stole a shopping cart. “I don’t know 
what we were thinking, but we stole a shopping 
cart and threw it in the woods,” he told me. 
Elicker remembers lifting the grocery-store 
staple as a singular moment of rebellion in his 
sheltered young life in the wealthy suburb of New 
Canaan, Connecticut. “It was really exhilarating,” 
he reflected, smiling sheepishly. “I still feel bad 
about it.” 
Elicker came of age in a community that 
regularly tops the charts for highest median 
family income in the United States. Just a forty-
five minute drive from New Haven, New Canaan 
is 95 percent white and looks strikingly different 
from the majority-minority city he’s hoping to 
run. “It was in one way very wholesome,” Elicker 
told me, “and in another way, devoid of a lot of 
the realities of the world.” Before moving to New 
Haven, he attended Middlebury College, then 
taught English in Taiwan, worked as a Foreign 
Service Officer in the U.S. State Department, 
and taught elementary school, high school, and 
college in Connecticut. He moved to New Haven 
in 2007 to attend Yale’s School of Forestry and the 
School of Management, and graduated in 2010. 
Now, nine years after graduating, he lives with his 
wife, Natalie, and their two kids on the top floor of 
a three-family house on Orange Street.

After outgrowing his days of snatching shopping-
carts, Elicker ran for mayor of New Haven 
for the first time in 2013, when he was 37 years 
old. He’d lived in New Haven for six years, and 
served as alder for the East Rock and Cedar Hill 
neighborhoods for four. His platform centered 
around “fresh solutions,” which he posted one by 
one for seventy-five days on his campaign website. 
The solutions touched on everything from police 
reform to vocational training programs to the 
bureaucracy of the preschool enrollment process. 
Hartford Courant reporter David Holihan wrote 
that he ran as “New Haven’s equivalent of Bernie 
Sanders, only younger and with better hair.” 
He had big plans and not much experience. His 
relationship to the city was shaped by his time at 
Yale, and some constituents seemed to feel that 
he hadn’t spent time in the neighborhoods he was 
hoping to represent. The unions staunchly backed 
his opponent Toni Harp, a fellow Yale graduate 
and a popular state senator. At one debate, Paul 
Bass, editor of the New Haven Independent, asked 
Elicker how he would succeed as mayor with “no 
appreciable support” from people of color in the 
city. 

In the 2013 election, his supporters looked very 
much like the people he’d grown up around: most 
of the 23 percent of the votes he accumulated in 
the Democratic primary came from the affluent, 
predominantly white neighborhoods of East Rock 
and Westville. After his loss in the primary, he ran 
With the mayor’s office in sight, Justin Elicker works 
to win New Haven’s trust.
