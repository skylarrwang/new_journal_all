DANIELLA COHEN
Naked for Edvard 
Munch
P O E M
– Daniella Cohen is a senior in 
Timothy Dwight College
She sits on the white 
cot, barely- 
breasts splitting 
her sternum and
a little rippled baby 
fat above the hands,
splayed to cover  
the parts now 
in formation—
that darkness about her—
the muck
of Puberty encroaching as if
a shadow cast 
in the mirror
She stays 
still a long while.
