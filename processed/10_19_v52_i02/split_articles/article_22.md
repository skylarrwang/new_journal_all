as an independent in the general election against 
Harp. She became the first woman to be mayor of 
New Haven; he went back to the drawing board.
Elicker’s 2019 campaign wasn’t entirely a 
departure from his campaign in 2013; both were 
grassroots-based and issues-centered. Each time, 
he emphasized his commitment to taking only 
donations that fell within the limit set by the 
Democracy Fund, New Haven’s public financing 
system ($370 in 2013 and $390 in 2019). But on 
the night of the 2019 primary election, something 
was different. An underdog from the beginning, 
Elicker won with 2,048 votes more than Harp. 
In 2013 he won in just seven wards, five of which 
included East Rock, downtown, and Yale’s campus. 
This year, he took fifteen. Though predominantly 
white neighborhoods remained a large portion of 
his support, New Haveners from all corners of the 
city turned out to vote for Elicker. At debates he 
received enthusiastic cheers. The city celebrated 
him. So what changed?
*
On a Monday night in the middle of September, 
one week after he’d come out on top of the 
Democratic primary that many doubted he’d win, 
Elicker threw a “campaign kick-off.” The mood 
was both celebratory and expectant. Supporters 
and friends from across the city filled the back 
room of BAR, a pizza restaurant on Crown Street. 
Bro-hugs were exchanged and backs were slapped 
and kids were fed New Haven-style pizza. Gage 
Frank, Elicker’s campaign manager, took down 
names and emails as supporters filed in. Violet 
string lights gave the room an optimistic glow.

Many people at the campaign kickoff had 
voted for Harp in past elections, or had worked 
with her in different capacities throughout her 
terms. Criticism of Harp was at an all-time high 
following her cost-cutting relaxation of lead 
paint regulations, her involvement in hiring an 
unpopular superintendent, and accusations of 
corruption in her administration. Maria Tupper, 
an Elicker supporter in attendance, said, “As a 
woman, it’s hard for me not to support another 
woman.” But, as many of his supporters agreed, 
the city needed transformation, and Elicker 
promised change.

By the time speeches started, the room was 
full. Ties were loosened; tables were packed; and 
those without seats stood. State representatives for 
Connecticut shared the stage, each talking for a 
few moments about their support for Elicker to 
gentle applause. Then Urn Pendragon, a former 
mayoral candidate, took the floor. “Unity is more 
than a five-letter word,” she insisted, and received 
a lukewarm “woo.” When Elicker stepped up 
onto the table and grabbed the microphone, he 
thanked every speaker. The crowd roared for each 
name. Tables shook. Kids stomped their feet. 
Nearly a week after the event, when I walked 
into Elicker’s campaign headquarters on the first 
cold day of September, the room was quiet. It 
was the first floor of a small building on Whalley 
Avenue, nestled between an auto body shop and a 
hair salon. The bricks were painted daffodil yellow. 
On the walls, butcher paper hung underneath a 
question: “What are your hopes for New Haven?” 
“Equity in all schools for all kids,” one message 
written in block letters insisted. “Let’s start with 
honesty and transparency,” suggested another. 
“Police accountability” huddled next to a large “Tax 
Yale,” with “I second that” and “So do I!” written 
carefully in faded green marker underneath. The 
WiFi password, NewLeadership2019, was pasted 
on each wall, along with a sign denoting how many 
shifts campaign volunteers and staff had taken for 
the week. “Justin: 18” was at the top of the most 
recent one. The only person who completed more 
shifts—his campaign manager, Gage—did so only 
by one. 

Kevin Alvarez, Elicker’s field manager, greeted 
me with a warm smile as I walked into campaign 
headquarters. I recognized him as the “Kevin” 
from Elicker’s encouragements to “email Kevin” 
in the videos that he posts on Facebook, Beto 
O’Rourke-style, shot from the front-facing camera 
on his iPhone. Like Beto, Elicker demonstrates 
his fluency in Spanish in the videos—a skill he 
has mobilized to mixed responses while debating 
and knocking on doors throughout his campaign. 
In the same tradition as Beto’s performance at the 
first presidential debate, Elicker’s willingness to 
speak in Spanish could be interpreted as a sign that 
he’s focused on communication and accessibility 
in governance—or, to some ears, it could ring as 
inauthentic.

One of the successes of Elicker’s 2019 campaign 
is the variety of ways he’s created relationships with 
voters. He engages with millennials online and 
with the elders of his city on their front porches. 
And his willingness to reveal his personality in his 
public presence shows—from his SoundCloud 
cover of The Rainbow Connection in the style 
of Kermit the Frog, to his storied Justin Bieber 
impression the Independent deemed “credible,” 
to the way he gives out his phone number freely 
online and in speeches.

Elicker wore his signature cornflower-blue 
shirt and held a Klean Kanteen gingerly with 
both hands as we spoke. He had a bad cold, but 
he talked through it in a soft and serious way, 
stopping when a story he told made him chuckle. 
I asked him why he would be the best person 
to be mayor. “I don’t think I’m the best person. 
Barack Obama would be better than me,” he said 
solemnly. (Many supporters applaud his humility.) 
He believes that the knowledge he’s gained over 
the past five years as executive director of the New 
Haven Land Trust and the perspective he’s gained 
from living in New Haven for more than a decade 
will set him up for success. 

Elicker took leadership of the Land Trust, a 
non-profit organization focused on local land 
stewardship and environmental education, in 
February 2014. Around that time, an embezzlement 
scandal involving Elicker’s predecessor racked 
the organization. Elicker moved the Land Trust 
forward,  spearheading a youth jobs training 
program, revitalizing Schooner Camp, and 
championing a series of community gardens—
which, five years later, are going strong.

While sharing a beer with her wife at Elicker’s 
campaign kickoff, Sally Esposito, a former 
educator who has watched the Land Trust evolve 
under Elicker’s leadership, told me that Elicker 
has gotten to know the city through his work in 
community gardens. She recalled watching him 
turn the Land Trust’s struggling finances around 
and shift it from an organization focused on wealthy 
neighborhoods into one that served her neighbors 
in Fair Haven who needed more help. She saw 
Elicker get his hands dirty in gardens across New 
Haven, growing familiar with neighborhoods he 
hadn’t spent much time in before. 

“I never knocked on doors in East Rock,” Elicker 
said about his most recent campaign. “I knocked 
on doors everywhere else in the city.” He found 
the process fulfilling, and it changed the way he 
campaigned. “It’s interesting how many things 
come up over and over and over again on the 
doors,” he said, mentioning affordable housing 
and free after-school programs as common topics 
of concern. The focus of his campaign shifted 
substantially from the neighborhoods that had 
supported him in 2013 to the neighborhoods he felt 
needed more attention, but his closest supporters 
remained committed—Elicker didn’t spend his 
canvassing time near his home, but he attended 
fundraisers in East Rock, and stayed close to his 
friends and supporters there. 

At the Land Trust, more than any place else, 
Elicker learned how to lead with his ears first. 
“It’s really important to not just show up, even 
if you’re pretty sure it’s the right thing to do, not 
just show up and tell people ‘we gotta do this,’ but 
to listen, and engage, and build trust,” he said. 
Elicker looked up at the ceiling quizzically while 
we talked, as if he were presently absorbed in the 
process of figuring out how he felt and what he 
should do. He repeated this gesture many times 
throughout our conversation, especially while 
reflecting on his relationship with one community 
gardener in particular, Alonzo Bryan. 

Bryan (whom Elicker calls “Mr. Alonzo”) 
tended a community garden on Hazel Street in 
Newhallville, for which he’d been caring alone for 
a couple of years. When the Land Trust approached 
him to ask if other Newhalville residents could 
garden in the plot, Bryan felt frustrated. “And 
it was fair for him not to be happy about that,” 
Elicker said, gazing upwards. But Elicker, no 
stranger to distrust, was persistent. He felt that 
the community in Newhallville should have an 
opportunity to cultivate their own soil, and benefit 
from the harvest. “Over time, we developed a 
relationship with him,” he said. Then, recently, 
Bryan welcomed a woman and a group of young 
children to Hazel Street to garden alongside him. 
Another thing that Elicker learned from his work 
with Bryan is that time can be an ally. “Things 
take a lot of time. And sometimes time is all it 
takes,” he said. Time has been good to Elicker; 
the six years between his campaigns account for 
half of his time living in New Haven. Part of his 
recent success is tied to the roots he’s put down in 
those years. 

Elicker has worked in the past years to distance 
himself from Yale. But Elicker’s engagement 
with New Haven, like incumbent Toni Harp’s, 
has been shaped by his time as a Yale student. 
When I asked him about how he would tax Yale, 
he paused, then placed two fingers on the table 
between us, in parallel lines. “What’s important 
is exploring those options at the same time that 
you build a relationship,” he told me. “Like two 
business that are potentially collaborating, but 
potentially competitive.” He turned a searching 
gaze upward once again.
