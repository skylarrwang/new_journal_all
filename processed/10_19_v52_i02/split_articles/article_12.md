SEAMS OF THE SELF
A local designer stitches a new philosophy of fashion 
into his “wearable art.”
T
yrone “Tea” Montgomery has one 
guiding principle of style: to dress 
according to how he feels. I met him 
on an uncharacteristically warm September 
afternoon, seated in Koffee next to a garment 
bag containing a riot of colorful clothing. “I 
can’t really say that I’m into fashion, so I can’t 
tell you the brands and the trends or things like 
that,” he explained, “but what I know is style.” 
He wore a white t-shirt, a snapback hat, and 
crisp custom-made tracksuit joggers sharpened 
by contrasting grey and white patterns. Striped 
socks wrapped up his look with a hint of color. 
Frustrated by a lack of originality and variety 
in the clothes he found at stores, Tea decided 
that if he couldn’t find the garments he wanted, 
he’d have to create them himself.
So he started Threads by Tea—a one-man 
business that sells “wearable art,” specially 
customized apparel designed and crafted by 
Tea. The start-up operates out of Tea’s New 
Haven studio and reaches customers through 
word of mouth, his “organically grown” local 
network, and social media platforms; he plans 
to expand soon to an online store.
Tea doesn’t work from a catalogue. Instead, he 
provides clients the space to express themselves 
through clothing designed specifically for 
them. As he explains it, his process of getting to 
know customers is simple: “First, tell me how 
you want to feel,” he said during a presentation 
reported by the New Haven Independent. 
“Then, tell me how you want to look.” Tea’s 
end goal is to make a garment that’s not just 
aesthetically appealing, but that captures 
the essence of a customer’s personality. Less 
interested in building pieces around his own 
style or brand, he custom-designs clothes to 
enhance the confidence of the people wearing 
them.
Tea exudes a sense of ease with himself. 
He recalled how he got his nickname: “As I 
grew and discovered myself, I recognized how 
people naturally feel calm and safe around me. 
I noticed how, much like a tea bag in water, 
I change my environment for the better.” 
As he enters an industry ruled by trends and 
characterized by a preference for models who 
look alike, Tea is determined to spread his 
commitment to self-expression. In just two 
years since generating the idea for his business, 
Tea has not only taught himself how to sew, but 
also welcomed others to join him as clients and 
collaborators. Threads by Tea’s Instagram and 
Facebook accounts brim with quotes set against 
its logo, a spool of thread spilling out of a teacup. 
The posts are punctuated by characteristic “.. .” 
dots, meant to act as both Tea’s signature and 
a pause for the reader—a brief “moment for 
thought,” he explained.
Tea prides himself on the fact that his 
business draws people from all walks of life; 
the typical Threads by Tea customer does not 
exist. “Regardless of what they do,” he said of 
his clients, who range in age from 4 to 70, “they 
want to make some noise in their worlds.”
This past spring, Tea eagerly took on his 
first large-scale project for Tia Russell Dance 
Studios: creating costumes for the Shubert 
Theatre’s summer production of Charlie and 
the Chocolate Factory. He had little experience 
in constructing dancewear and only two and a 
half months to complete the commission. Still, 
he tirelessly pushed through trial and error to 
create fifty-four costumes full of whimsy and 
color.
When we met at Koffee, Tea unpacked his 
overflowing garment bag and handed me a plaid 
snapback. The shimmering, sleek underside of 
the hat, lined with a trimming I could imagine 
on the hem of a dress, took me by surprise. 
Tea sifted through his collection of jumpsuits 
and two-pieces: a patchwork of paisley squares 
popped against black knit pants, floral pinks 
met geometric reds and blues, and patterns 
exploded with each shifting hem.
Tea, looking up from his clasped hands, said 
that he was born and raised in New Haven. 
“I left for school and such, moved away a 
couple of times, but I always come back,” 
he said. A Bachelor’s in Marketing at UC 
Berkeley, a Master’s in Entertainment Business 
Management at Full Sail University, and an 
unfulfilling position in sales and hospitality led 
him back to his hometown. After returning to 
New Haven, he said, he set out on a “journey” 
to discover “how to use my real talents and 
abilities to make a living my way.” 
Tea had mentioned that he incorporates 
music into his practice, so I clicked through his 
SoundCloud page, where he sometimes refers 
to himself as “Montgom’ry Tea.” The page’s 
description muses: “An artist’s journey...is to 
teach themselves to the world.”
Scrolling through track after track, I saw Tea 
reappear on each album cover. On one, he is 
accompanied by ghostly cartoon characters 
splattered with purple and green at a table 
littered with doodled bottles. On another, he 
beams in sunglasses and an elegant black blazer. 
I click on a song entitled “I Guess,” not knowing 
what to expect. Diana Ross’s booming intro to 
“Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” merges 
with Tea’s rapping and an echoing melody. I 
can sense the same impulse to fuse Diana Ross 
with Tea’s own voice in the collision of fabrics 
in a single garment. His plans for a Threads 
by Tea showcase within the next year or so 
include five collections, each accompanied by 
a corresponding EP album.
As his philosophy of individuality continues to 
steep and spread in the communities he works 
with, Tea encourages his customers to wear 
their personalities boldly on their sleeves. Artist 
and educator Meghan Shah was struck by Tea’s 
ability to create statement pieces that empower 
his clients. She remembered several instances 
in which strangers approached Tea and told him 
they would never have been able to pull off his 
look, but Tea makes it his mission to encourage 
these same people instead to embrace these 
outfits in what Shah calls “accessible” clothing. 
Since their meeting, the collaboration has 
“developed a voice of its own” through a mixture 
of Shah’s fabric and Tea’s clothing design, with 
her textiles set to be included in an upcoming 
line of his clothing. They even worked together 
to fuse Shah’s purple, blue, and white pattern 
with Tea’s vision in a tunic made especially for 
her. “I felt like I was all that,” Shah laughed as 
she fondly recalled the process of making the 
overcoat with him. Above all, she admires Tea’s 
ability to dress for himself, not for the occasion.
