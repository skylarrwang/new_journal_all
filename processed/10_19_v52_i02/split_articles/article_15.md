dorm rooms, carrying electricity to bedside lamps 
and lecture halls.
When Bublitz walks through the plant, he 
listens for problems. After twenty-five years 
of working here, he knows the sounds of the 
machinery like a parent knows their child’s cries. 
Pings are comforting; gurgling is not a good 
sign. The sound he dislikes most of all is water 
hammer—the banging noise produced when 
steam barrelling through pipes contains water 
droplets that collide with difficult-to-navigate pipe 
corners. Like bullets in a body, these errant water 
particles can seriously damage the equipment.

The turbines and gas compressors and boilers 
are housed within a neo-Gothic brick structure 
that is over a century old. Natural light floods the 
ground floor, where most of the vital machinery 
hums along. Elegant floor to ceiling windows 
belie the fact that the building is explosion-proof, 
a feature that is particularly important given that 
the plant is surrounded on all sides by people, 
living and dead. Bublitz’s colleague jokes that we 
are sitting on ancient burial grounds: across the 
road is Grove Street Cemetery; the bodies of the 
“unholy” who died by suicide are rumoured to 
have been buried underneath at the edge of the 
cemetery, underneath our very feet.

Bublitz tells me wistfully about the artistry of 
the century-old architecture. When he arrived, 
the plant still proudly bore the original pumps, 
brass whistles, drip canisters, and brick-set 
Bigelow boilers. Wrought iron handrails lined the 
machinery. The year was 1994, but the atmosphere 
recalled the golden age of steam, the age of Nikola 
Tesla’s electrical dreams.

In those days, the boilers weren’t lit by the 
flip of a switch but by a guy with a torch. In the 
mornings, Bublitz’s team would send someone to 
light four of the boilers with a six-foot steel rod 
wrapped in asbestos cloth, drenched in diesel oil 
and fired off with a zippo lighter.
“Instead of a computer judging when to add 
more fuel or air or dampers we did it with our 
brains,” Bublitz tells me.

Thermally inert and non-flammable, asbestos 
seemed like a match made in heaven for insulating 
boilers. But between 1979 and 2000, hundreds of 
deaths due to asbestosis and mesothelioma, a type 
of cancer, were reported in Connecticut. The 
Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance lists Yale power 
plants as one of the job sites where you may have 
been exposed to harmful asbestos. Bublitz insists 
that as long as the asbestos was soaked, there was 
no danger—it’s when the toxic chemical turns 
into a dust or powder form that you have to be 
worried. 

Bublitz’s recollections seem almost mythic 
to me as I walk through the power plant on a 
Wednesday morning in September. The asbestos 
torches and brick-set boilers have been replaced 
by computerized signal systems and Italian-
made gas turbines. The fluorescent strip lights 
lining the walkways will soon make way for more 
environmentally-friendly LED lighting. The only 
continuity is steam. For as long as these energy-
charged vapours continue to spin turbines, Bob 
Bublitz’s steampunk dream hums on. 

In the plant, there is no room for error. In the 
winter, the stakes are even higher. One day in 
January 2008, it was 7 degrees and bitterly cold. 
A line ruptured in Gas Turbine Number Two. 
Bublitz, at that point the oiler, was in charge of 
turning valves and checking equipment. He was 
warming up two back-up boilers when an alarm 
pierced the frigid air. His shift partner went 
to investigate. Before he even got to the unit, it 
exploded. 

But unlike a lot of companies that operate with 
a tight bottom-line, Yale spends money to have 
extensive back-up systems. “Within seconds of 
the explosion, the built-in fire suppression system 
kicked in and the fire was out. By the time the fire 
company came, there was no actual fire,” Bublitz 
recalls. 

There was another problem, however: all three 
turbines were out of commission. Bublitz and the

team fired up two temporary boilers to keep the 
heat and electricity running to campus. Working 
for hours through the night, they saved valuable 
equipment from freezing and averted a possible 
crisis of hypothermia. No one even noticed the 
explosion. “All the students slept through the 
night with a smile on their face,” Bublitz said. I 
could find no news on the event dating back to 
the time, although the plant records confirm that 
it happened. For Bublitz, it is a point of pride that 
his work is unnoticed. It means that nothing has 
gone wrong.

The plant manager takes me up several flights of 
stairs to the roof, where water spray swirls in white 
clouds. Eight chiller towers remove heat from 
the air-conditioner water returning from campus. 
Two brick smokestacks reach like armadillo tails 
to the pale summer sky. In the age of catalytic 
converters, the name “smokestack” doesn’t mean 
what it used to; I can see no smoke billowing from 
these towers.

The floor vibrates like the chest of a great beast. 
Big white fans on the roof pull the water toward the 
sky to dissipate the heat, before sending hundreds 
of gallons back down across chevron corrugated 
plates. I am standing before a great industrial 
waterfall.

From the roof, I can see the lamp-lit windows of 
the Sterling Memorial Library stacks and students 
zipping on bicycles between their classes. 
The Yalies and faculty who depend on the plant never 
give it a second thought, in much the same way 
that we never consider the unceasing palpitations 
of our own hearts.  

“Though we are never seen, we know that we 
have an important function,” Bublitz tells me later. 
“I may never be a great writer or politician or lawyer, 
but I bet I kept a few warm and the light on they 
studied by.” Behind the tall brick walls of the plant, 
seated in the control room, Bublitz monitors the 
machinery at the core of Yale’s operations. When 
dusk falls, his shift will end and his colleagues will 
take his place to keep the flame burning through 
the night. He is hidden, exactly as he thinks he 
should be.
