don’t go into medicine unless you’re committed to 
lifelong learning.”
As I gathered my things, Sanders repeated 
something she’d heard the Dean of Yale’s medical 
school say on opening day this year. “Fifty percent 
of what you learn in medical school is going to be 
wrong. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you which 50 
percent.” 
On television and in her writing, Sanders 
guides her readers and viewers through a search 
for the right answers to rare medical mysteries. 
But in person, she seems more comfortable with 
not knowing all the solutions. She’s determined to 
make people realize that uncertainty is inevitable, 
and that we must learn to be content with that 
fact.
