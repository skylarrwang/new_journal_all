o an uninformed observer, Bob 
Bublitz looks like he might be in the 
belly of a ship. He sits behind an array of 
computer monitors in the control room of Yale’s 
Central Power Plant on Tower Parkway, watching 
red and green indicators blink at him like boats 
passing in the night. Bublitz has a white sailor’s 
beard, cast-iron shoulders, and forearms as thick 
as pipes. He served six years in the Navy, attaining 
the rank of Petty Officer second class by the time 
he left. When he first joined at eighteen, eager to 
continue the Bublitz family tradition of military 
service, he wanted to be a machinist. The only 
opening was for a boiler technician. “So into the 
pit I went,” he says. 

Working amid steam vapor in the hull of a navy 
ship, Bublitz was reminded of the steampunk 
adventurers in the novels of Jules Verne and the 
boiler room where Jack and Rose share a kiss in 
the Titanic. He was in love. And the object of his 
passion was steam-powered machinery. 

He stayed in the business of harnessing energy 
from steam after he was honourably discharged—
first, in a boiler room in a Hartford firearms 
factory, then at Yale. He hasn’t been in the Navy 
for more than two and a half decades now. And 
we are not in the belly of a ship. We are in the 
65,000-square-foot plant that keeps the lights 
on, the heat running, and the air chilled for the 
25,000-odd people who live and work on Yale’s 
central campus and Science Hill. 

At 7 a.m., as students and faculty stir in their 
beds, flip on the lights and turn on the shower, the 
engineers and mechanics and oilers at the plant 
come in for their shifts. Those who worked the 
night shift shuffle bleary-eyed out of the plant. On 
Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving and New 
Year’s, every hour, every day of the year, every 
year, the machinery churns on.

Outside the control room, the gas turbine 
grumbles constantly and loudly (at around ninety 
decibels), forcing the plant workers to stuff their 
ears with foam plugs to prevent hearing damage. 
Plumes of pale steam waft between serpentine 
pipes. “Victory Energy, Full Steam Ahead!” is 
emblazoned on the side of a boiler. The plant 
compresses and burns natural gas that is piped in, 
producing electricity and waste heat in the process. 
The waste heat boils water into ‘free steam’ in 
these boilers. Pregnant with energy, the highly-
pressurized steam flows over and spins the turbine’s 
blades. The steam feeds everything—the heaters 
in the winter and chillers for air-conditioning 
in the summer. Delicate cables housed in silver 
metal conduits branch out from the plant beneath 
the streets of New Haven, around cemeteries and
