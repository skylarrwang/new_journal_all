A
fter her fourth night of troubled 
sleep, Urn Pendragon decided to run 
for mayor of New Haven. She had been 
weighing the prospect since a public hearing 
at City Hall on February 21, when hundreds of 
community members congregated to discuss Yale’s 
failure to fulfill a promise it had made in 2015 
to hire 1,000 New Haven residents. Pendragon 
had mulled over the testimonies of her fellow 
New Haveners for days. After nearly two years of 
organizing in New Haven, this was the moment 
that “set me over the edge,” she recalls.

At 48 years old, Pendragon felt “political” for 
the first time. Up until then, she experienced 
life through a “mental fog” that obscured any 
motivation to engage politically. She attributes 
the alleviation of this fog to her gender transition, 
which acted as a kind of biological and spiritual 
solvent, dissolving the haze through which she 
had lived her entire life. 

Pendragon’s relationship to her trans identity is 
“unique,” in her words, and arose unexpectedly. 
In her mid-40s, Pendragon was diagnosed with 
Klinefelter syndrome, which affects individuals 
with two or more X chromosomes and a Y 
chromosome. She decided to undergo hormone 
replacement therapy, coming out to friends and 
family as a trans woman. The result was instant: 
the fog lifted. 

Before her transition, Pendragon experienced 
a severe bout of clinical depression linked to 
overproduction of estrogen and testosterone—a 
result of Klinefelter syndrome. “For me,” Pendragon 
began, “because I couldn’t focus, because of my 
anatomy—you’re withdrawn from the things that 
you truly want to do or how you want to behave. 
You’re stifled.” Yet Pendragon is cautious not 
to universalize her experience. Although her 
navigation of gender has been intimately linked 
with biology, she acknowledges that the two “can 
be both separate and intertwined.”

As a local activist, Pendragon seeks to “fix the 
problems instead of trying to outlive them.” She 
has lobbied in front of the General Assembly 
for a fifteen-dollar minimum wage and served 
on the Affordable Housing Task Force; she 
supported local civic action events, like the Stop 
& Shop strikes that resulted in better pay and 
healthcare coverage for workers; she participated 
in negotiations over renewed police contracts; she 
advocated for a state bill that created a paid family 
and medical leave system. 

When I asked Pendragon where she wanted to 
meet, she invited me to a meeting with Mothers 
and Others for Justice, a group of New Haveners 
who gather to build community through activism 
and legislative action. Pendragon attends these 
meetings every month in the basement of Stepping 
Stone Transitional Housing on Winchester. Having 
taken the Yale shuttle as far up Winchester as the 
route allowed, I found myself before a sienna brick 
building, with windows partitioned into triptychs, 
and an ecru set of double doors that looked more 
decorative than functional. Following the rasp of 
skateboard wheels on asphalt, I wound around the 
building to a ramp leading into a basement, where 
I would find Pendragon, wearing a Nike t-shirt and 
pale denim, doling out side-hugs and balancing a 
plateful of food. 

Pendragon’s eyes glowed with the phosphoric 
glaze of the fluorescent lights. The tendrils of 
wavy blonde hair that evaded her studded silver 
headband fell leisurely onto her face. When I 
asked Pendragon why she wanted to meet here, 
she scanned the room. There was a communal 
heap of rotisserie chicken and coleslaw by the 
door, and Audre Lorde quotes framed in the 
menthe construction paper that decorated the 
walls. Fellow activists chatted at tables, forming a 
‘U’ shape around the room. 

Mothers and Others was the first community 
in which Pendragon encountered unwavering 
acceptance—where her serious involvement in 
grassroots organizing began. Here she met people 
who, like her, had experienced homelessness and 
food insecurity. Taking a swig of apple juice, she 
said, “It was a really great fit for me, but also, I 
have a lot of friends here.” 

Pendragon was born in Lansing, Michigan, and 
was less than a year old when her mother divorced 
her father. Together, she and her mother moved 
often across the Midwest and South. Her most 
salient memories linger between St. Louis, Tulsa, 
and the Winston-Salem area of North Carolina. 
Yet she couldn’t identify with the places that raised 
her. “It was like taking a New Yorker and shoving 
them in the middle of the country,” she remarked.

Pendragon 
moved 
to 
South 
Windsor, 
Connecticut, 
after 
graduating 
from 
SUNY 
Stonybrook with a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology 
over ten years ago, and she has stayed in the 
state ever since. She worked for Cablevision for 
five years but was one of six hundred employees 
laid off when the company was bought out. After 
taking a moment to reflect on what came next for 
her, Pendragon looked at me and said, “The cards 
stacked up in just the right order.” 

Shortly after, Pendragon discovered she was 
eligible for a state program that subsidizes higher 
education for recently laid-off workers. She 
made an early withdrawal from her (401)k to 
buy a car. She arranged to live with one friend 
in New Haven during the week and with another 
in West Haven on weekends so she could attend 
class at Southern Connecticut State University. 
Pendragon was determined to get her Master’s in 
Political Science; she couldn’t see herself studying 
anything else. “Politics touches every part of our 
lives,” she remarked, “and I’ve been running with 
it since then.” 

The central policy goal of Pendragon’s 
mayoral campaign was the implementation of an 
inclusionary zoning ordinance that would require 
20 to 22 percent of units in new housing projects 
to be affordable housing. As of April 2019, she 
said, “twelve out of the fifteen towns in the New 
Haven region dip below the 10 percent threshold 
for affordable housing.” Pendragon presented the 
inclusionary zoning initiative, paired with city 
advocacy for solar farms, wind turbines, and other 
forms of sustainable energy, in her “New Haven 
Green Deal.” 

When I asked Pendragon why affordable 
housing is so central to her campaign strategy, she 
told me that she sees housing as “the central issue 
of our lives.”

Urn Pendragon exited New Haven’s mayoral 
race, but she hasn’t given up her cause.


“You spend anywhere between 30 and 60 
percent of your money to put a roof over your 
head. If you’re paying more than you should, 
which is anywhere between 25 and 30 percent, 
there is such a discontinuity,” Pendragon tells me. 
Her hands fiddle with the tassel of her purse. “For 
those of us who are between homelessness and 
being able to afford housing…it’s really no way 
to live.” 

In the middle of the Mothers and Others for 
Justice meeting, Pendragon pushes her chair back 
and stands to make an announcement: she has 
decided to withdraw from the mayoral race. 
Justin Elicker, who had won the Democratic 
primary days earlier, shares many of Pendragon’s 
policy priorities, such as inclusionary zoning and 
a bill to combat homelessness. After his victory, 
Elicker asked Pendragon to join his administration 
in an “amalgamated” position that would combine 
policy-making, city-planning, and economic 
development. Pendragon tells the crowd that she 
accepted Elicker’s offer. The room swells with 
applause. 

As I walk with Pendragon to her car after the 
meeting, I anticipate a cast of disappointment 
to undergird her attitude toward Elicker. But 
any mournfulness she feels about the race is 
overshadowed by an excitement to develop an 
affordable housing plan under Elicker’s tenure.   

I ask her if she thinks it would have been possible 
for her to win the race with her background. “Of 
course!” Pendragon declares. I notice the solar 
panels that shimmer on the roof of her car under 
the opal light of the moon. She gushes to me 
about an idea she has: a collaboration with a local 
artist to create wind turbines that could contribute 
aesthetically to the city and reinforce New Haven’s 
commitment to sustainable energy. 

When I ask Pendragon why she ran for mayor 
in 2019, she explains, “the timing was not right 
before.” Prior to getting her Master’s, Pendragon 
lacked the theoretical framework to articulate her 
own experiences, something she saw as essential 
to her candidacy. However, even with a graduate 
education, Pendragon’s entry into the political 
sphere has presented formidable challenges. 

“Filling out the forms at the City Clerk office 
was very easy to do. That’s always accessible,” 
Pendragon says. But the race’s accessibility is also 
contingent on factors such as exposure, personal 
experience, and connections, Pendragon explains. 
Lacking in any of these areas could be devastating 
to a campaign, even for candidates who consider 
themselves “qualified.” 

I think about what it means to be qualified. 
Is knowing how to navigate the bureaucracy 
and formalities of politics what makes a person 
qualified? Or is the stake a person holds in the issues 
they are fighting for, and an intimate knowledge 
of those issues, also of value? Pendragon’s mayoral 
run carried a personal urgency missing from 
her former competitors’ campaigns; she and her 
community are the ones primarily affected by the 
consequences. This is where the power in her 
activism lies. For Pendragon, waiting to outlive 
these issues is not an option.
