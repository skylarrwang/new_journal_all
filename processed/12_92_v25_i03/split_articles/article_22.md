the AIDS epidemic and Kramer's own 
battles with GMHC, it quickly 
became both a critical and popular 
success. While the play enhanced 
Kramer's credibility, his outspokenness 
created controversy once again. 
Although ACT UP's radical tactics 
included an infamous protest at St. 
Patrick's Cathedral, where members 
chained themselves to pews, threw 
condoms in the air, and brought high 
mass to a quick halt, Kramer wanted 
the group to go even further. "Larry's 
power decreased at the time of the 
1990 San Francisco AIDS Conference, 
when he called for riots and violence," 
recalled Novick. "The activist commu-
nity sharply rejected the idea. It was a 
kind of repeat of the rejection he had 
experienced from GMHC." 

After the conference, Kramer kept 
a lower profile, but he never retracted 
his provocative call for action. ''I'm not 
by nature a terrorist, but I'm amazed 
that there hasn't been violence," he 
said. "I'm amazed that, with all these 
people dying of AIDS, somebody with 
nothing to lose hasn't taken a pot shot 
at Jesse Helms or Pat Buchanan." 

While the activist community 
drew back from Kramer, he watched 
helplessly as ACT UP lost its energy. 
The very success of ACT UP had taken 
its toll. When the Bush administration 
began to respond to some of the 
group's demands, ACT UP decided to 
tackle additional issues like abortion 
and gay and lesbian rights. 

Disagreements over the direction 
of ACT UP prompted some members 
to quit the group. "Vanguard organiza-
tions never have long lives," explained 
Jason Heffner, a former member of 
ACT UP and a policy analyst for the 
National AIDS Commission. "Many 
of us moved into ACT UP very early, 
dropping everything else we were 
doing in our lives to work on it. Finally 
we had to come back to what we had 
left." 

By 1991, Kramer himself suffered 
from the emotional fatigue of his 
decade-long fight, especially since doc-
tors had diagnosed him as HIV-posi-
tive the year before. In addition, the 
second organization that he had helped 
create slipped steadily out of his con-
trol. "At ACT UP, we bent over back-
wards not to start another awful 
bureaucracy like GMHC," he sajd. 
"We went too far, creating something 
that's democratic to a flaw, where every 
crazy in the wodd can come and 
obstruct progress." 

The radical, often hateful rhetoric 
of ACT UP disappeared from much of 
Kramer's writing. Th~ D~stiny of M~, 
his critically-acclaimed sequel to Th~ 
Normal H~art that recently premiered 
off-Broadway, deals as much with his 
troubled family life as with his AIDS 
activism. In the new play, the unfeeling 
bureaucrats of Th~ Normal H~art have 
become more sympathetic doctors and 
nurses, reflecting Kramer's own experi-
ence with the medical establishment 
since his HIV diagnosis. 

Kramer worries that his personal 
acquaintance with the people he criti-
cizes has compromised his effectiveness 
as an activist. But his most frequent 
targets disagree. "Even though he's a 
personal friend, it makes news when he 
attacks me," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, 
director of AIDS research for NIH. 
"He can blast me in the press one day, 
and we'll discuss it over dinner the 
next." Kramer has in the past labeled 
the doctor an incompetent idiot and a 
monster, but Fauci brushes aside such 
insults as merely Kramer's way of bait-
ing the media. 

Not all of his friends find Kramer's 
stinging words so easy to ignore. "I 
credit Larry Kramer with saving my life 
and millions of other gay men's lives. 
He's a hero to me, and I don't have 
many heroes anymore," said Heffner. 
"But I haven't escaped his wrath or crit-
icism now that I work in the govern-
ment, so my admiration is not without 
a certain amount of pain." 

The Sullivan incident once again 
demonstrated Kramer's willingness to 
alienate friends in the name of his 
cause. While then-Yale president 
Benno Schmidt and the Corporation 
maintained that Greany and the other 
protesters denied Sullivan freedom of 
speech, Kramer claimed that the whole 
incident had been blown out of pro-
portion. "Twenty-five people scream-
ing in Batt~ll Chapel was hardly the 
earth-shattering event that Benno was 
determined to make it appear," he said. 
The Executive Committee eventually 
dropped the charges against Greany, 
but not before Kramer had angered his 
friends on the Corporation. 

Kramer's concern for today's gay 
Yalies may reflect his own college years, 
which were none too bright. As a fresh-
person, academic difficulties and lone-
liness drove him to attempt suicide. "I 
think I truly felt as if I were the only 
gay person at Yale," he recalled. "I 
didn't make any contacts with anyone 
in my own age group in a gay way for 
my entire four years." 

In addition to his intervention on 
Greany's behalf, Kramer has also spo-
ken at a few of Yale's gay events and 
given lectures about AIDS for various 
courses. H e sometimes talks about 
moving back to New Haven to work 
with students. 

"I just hope that gay kids are 
proud of being gay, and that Yale 
accepts and recognizes them," he said. 
"I guess of all the places in the world, 
New Haven represents to me the 
depths of despair that I once was in, 
and how far I've come from that 
despair. And how far the world has 
come, too.
