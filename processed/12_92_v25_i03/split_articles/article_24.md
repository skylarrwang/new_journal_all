Until Emily Honig's appoint-
ment, the program a no m uence 
on the tenure process. Th1s proce-
ure as e to c arges t at sc oar-
ship in women's studies has not been 
accorded enough legitimacy. 
Many women's studies support-
ers point to the case of Professor 
Micaela di Leonardo as an example of 
how this arrangement hurts the pro-
gram. Di Leonardo left Yale two 
years ago after the anthropology 
department did not grant her tenure. 
Although acclaimed by feminist 
scholars, her work did not seem sig-
nificant enough to merit tenure in the 
eyes of senior faculty in the anthro-
pology department. 
In protest, students formed an ad 
hoc committee and drew up a list of 
demands. "We wanted a review of the 
process," said Aoki. "We wanted it to 
be more flexible so that there would 
be more input from others who rec-
ognized work in women's studies as 
work." Committee members request-
ed that money be allocated for a joint 
tenure position to be shared by 
women's studies, and a general re-
evaluation of the tenure procedure. 
Without senior positions to move 
into, women's studies faculty leave 
Yale after six or seven years, the usual 
amount of time for assistant profes-
sors unless they get promoted. Their 
departures create a sense of instability. 
"What makes the overall faculty affili-
ated with women's studies seem more 
volatile is that it's not really under the 
control of the program," said Cott. 
According to Long, however, the 
university has supported the pro-
gram. He points to the joint promo-
tion of Honig, which would have cost 
the university more money because 
one senior professorship equals two 
junior positions in cost. "The admin-
istration has agreed to thJ: creation of 
the senior position, which immedi-
ately changes the nu~ber of junior 
faculty equivalents from two to 
three," he said. 
Long admits that in the past 13 
years the constant change that has 
plagued the women's studies program 
has primarily burdened students. 
"The current undergraduates have 
had a hard time with continuity," he 
said. "Micaela di Leonardo's depar-
ture, the delay in replacing her, and 
Emily Honig's departure have made 
continuity appear more difficult in 
the past few years." 
Women's studies majors bal-
ance their frustrations against their 
enjoyment of their courses. " My 
women's studies classes have been 
absolutely the most exciting classes 
I've taken at Yale," said Waterhouse, 
"the classes in which I've been on the 
edge of my seat." 
Honig's tenure would have 
brought new hope for stability as well 
as vitality in the program. Her depar-
ture, and the university's failure to flU 
the postion, have left students doubt-
ful of improvement in the near 
future. "You take what you can get," 
said Brenowitz, "when you're a 
women's studies major."
