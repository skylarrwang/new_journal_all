D4T, a new AIDS drug developed 
at the Yale School 'Of Medicine, may 
overtake AZT as the leading means of 
prolonging the lives of people with 
AIDS. Developed with the help of a 
patent and funding from Bristol-
Meyers Squibb, and with a boost from 
a new Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) program that speeds drugs' 
transition from laboratory to patient, 
the drug has successfully passed two 
rounds of laboratory testing. D4T has 
left its creators-Or. William Prushoff 
and researcher Tai-Shu Lin-and gone 
on to clinical trials at about 45 institu-
tions in the United States and Europe. 

Thanks to the FDA's new Parallel 
Tracking Program, physicians may now 
prescribe D4T to patients who cannot 
handle other drugs, even though the 
new drug has not completed the thre~ 
phases of testing that the FDA usually 
requires before it officially approves a 
dtug. Extensive clinical trials follow two 
rounds of laboratory tests, a costly and"" 
time-consuming process. "From con? 
ception to counter, a drug costs $250 
million and can take as long as ten 
years," said Prushoff. However, as the 
first drug approved under the FDA's 
new program, D4T was released on a 
limited basis at the beginning of clinical 
testing. 

Results of the laboratory tests indi-
cate that D4T may often succeed where 
AZT and DDI, other widely-used 
drugs that fight AIDS, have failed. 
D4T has already proved more effective 
than DDI, and its beneficial effects last 
much longer than AZT's, according to 
a July report in The Walt Street journal 
More significantly, Prushoff said the 
first phase of testing has already shown 
that D4T has a lower toxicity than 
AZT, which can damage bone marrow. 
Prushoff hopes that more patients will 
be able to take D4T, and that they will 
be able to do so for a longer period than

they could with AZT. 

With D4T, Prushoff continues a 
research career that began with the first 
herpes drug intended to combat eye 
infections, which he developed in the 
1950s. Since then, he has specialized in 
"modification structure"-synthesizing 
compounds that mimi<;: parts of the 
DNA molecule, but actually inhibit it 
from replicating. D4T, like AZT and 
the herpes drug, works at the molecular 
level on this principle. In anti-cancer as 
well as in anti-AIDS drugs, modifica-
tion structure aims to prevent viral 
DNA from reproducing itself, cutting 
short the most basic process through 
which infection spreads. 

Prushoff calls modification struc-
ture "a widely-used but inefficient 
approach." He looks toward new tech-
nologies that may soon reduce medical 
guesswork, such as X-ray crystallogra-
phy, which allows scientists to see 
molecular structure more easily. 

Awaiting these improved techniques, 
Prushoff hopes that work like his will 
become more precise. "Right now," he 
said, "it's rational serendipity."
