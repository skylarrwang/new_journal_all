nization. Kramer himself helped create the group in 1981. 
At the time, he was already infamous within the gay com-
munity for his 1978 novel Faggots, which criticized the shal-
low sex-oriented gay life of the late 70s and enraged many 
who had fought so long for sexual freedom. When Kramer 
wrote to the N~w York Nativ~, a gay newspaper, to express 
his worry about the deaths of some friends from what 
would later be called AlDS, many gays scoffed at the man 
who had urged them to change before they "fucked them-
selves to death." 
"I think the concealed meaning in Kramer's emotional-
ism is the triumph of guilt: that gay men deserve to die 
from their promiscuity," responded Robert Chesley in a let-
ter to the Nativ~. "With Kaposi's sarcoma attacking gay 
men, Kramer assumes he knows the cause." Although many 
would later dub Kramer the prophet of AlDS, much of the 
gay community at the time felt, as Chesley did, that Kramer 
had overestimated the danger of the new and strange disease 
and was using it to reinforce a prudish anti-sex message. 
Kramer's controversial personality soon landed him in 
hot water with the very organization he had helped found. 
"GMHC thinks that it can't do anything that confronts the 
system," he said. "They just go out and raise money and 
very quietly tend to their own. It's cowardice on their part, 
and it used to drive me insane." 
Kramer's insistence that GMHC sp~ out against the 
government caused other board members to fear that he 
would alienate crucial officials. When the group finally 
secured a long-sought meeting with Mayor Koch in 1983, 
fear of a Kramer diatribe led GMHC leaders to exclude him 
from the session. They subsequently voted him off the 
board of the organization. "You need to be able to work 
within the system. That's how we've always 
approached it," said David Eng, a 
spokesperson for GMHC. "We feel that it's 
important to be in Washington, Albany, and 
New York City making sure that fair and 
effective AlDS legislation is passed." 
But in the early 80s, organizations like 
GMHC fought an uphill battle. Many offi-
cials on the state and local levels took their cue 
from Washington, where Ronald Reagan avoided the 
subject of AlDS. While the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) sat on the $8 million designated for research on the 
disease, Reagan's Secretary of Health and Human Services 
Margaret Heckler claimed that AlDS was not underfunded. 
"I'd call the Reagan policy the passive extermination of gay 
men and IV drug users," said biology professor Alvin 
Novick. Even Surgeon General C. Everett Koop blasted the 
president for his unwillingness to address the problem. 
Kramer vented his anger at GMHC and the govern-
ment through Th~ Normal H~art, an autobiographical play 
that debuted in April 1985. Chronicling the first years of
