Fire Station Democracy

W;
en people calk about the Dwight-Edgewood 
eighborhood that extends down Whalley 
Avenue, they invariably mention its diverse 
blend of people. The neighborhood's socio-economic, eth-
nic, and religious mix drew me to the community's polling 
place on election day. I hoped to observe voting day action 
in a neighborhood known as a microcosm of New Haven. 


As dusk approached, I parked on a side. street nestled 
between grandiose Victorian mansions and low-income 
apartments. Down the road, I found an unassuming fire 
station with huge glass-paneled garage doors. The isolated 
clusters of people outside did not match the crowd con-
tained in the small rectangular structure. People filled the 
building, forming an immense line that lumbered slowly 
forward towards the voting booths. 


Lieutenant Don Donahu, the fire staciCU1's command-
ing officer, described the crowd as "multi-international," 
carefully enunciating each syllable. Indeed, in my first few 
moments I saw Orthodox Jews, Latinos, 
Mrican Americans, 
business suits, 
lies, and Yale students. It looked like 
the whole community had migrated 
through rainy cold and conglomerated 
in the hazy glow of the fire station on 
120 Ellsworth St. "People are droving in 
here to put their little vote in, n com-
mented firefighter Leon Brown, who was 
on duty to help voting proceed smoothly. 


Outside, bundled up in a blue parka, Sally 
Connelly distributed Democratic literature 
to her neighbors. "People are really eager and 
committed," she commented. "I've heard 
some wonderful stories of people who've just gone through 
fire and brimstone to vote." 


Inside, wisps of conversation, screams of impatient chil-
dren, and the ever-present chatter of the fire-station radio 
filled the air. But even the poll-workers' cajpling, "Tighten 
up ... Get close ... Everyone start hugging and kissing ... Move 
to the back of the bus," could not pierce the almost surreal 
hush of those in the line, a line which showed no sign of 
ending. As quickly as possible, the official checkers marked 
off each name on the huge white sheets that listed the 
neighborhood's residents. "I didn't think there would be this 
many people, to tell you the truth," remarked Omar Ursini, 
one of the checkers. Another checker, Katheline Faight, 
added, "Eighty percent turnout and still coming, will you 
look at this!" Ursini continued, "The crowd hasn't let up 
since 6:00 this morning. We've done almost 2,000 people." 


The only people who did not participate in the com-
motion consuming the fire station were those who worked 
there every day. The firefighters idled at the edge of the 
chaotic scene, strangely displaced from their own turf. 


Lieutenant Donahu stood at the doorway of his office and 
smoked. "When I opened up the station, there were people 
waiting in line outside in the pouring rain to vote," he 
observed in a New Haven accent. "The incumbents are in 
trouble, in my opinion. It's time for a change." 


It's tim~ for a chang~. Outside and inside, poll workers, 
voters, and campaign volunteers chanted this phrase like a 
prayer. Throughout the campaign, I had thought this slo-
gan to be a corny sound-bite, painfully lacking supporting 
substance from any candidate. But obviously, in the 24th 
Ward, a yearning for realistic innovation was driving people 
to participate in the election process. "They're tired of the 
starus quo," said Faight. Ursini half-joked, "I hope so." 


Outside, in the misty drizzle chat penetrated just 
enough to freeze the ink of my ballpoint pen, the voters also believed that their vote might help fuel thts 
much-heralded change. David Roberts, a computer opera-
tor, said, "This is the first time I decided to vote. Because of 
the way the economy is and the way people who've been in 
public office have been running it, I thought now I would 
be able to say something and it would count." 


For some the line was too overwhelming. An old man 
in an overcoat opened the door, took one look at the crowd, 
and muttered, "Don't have the attitude for this." But sue~ 
reac~ions proved rare. While a few looked frustrated and 
tired, a neighborly, almost convivial atmosphere flowed 
through the fire station. "A few people have left. They have 
to be at work," said assistant registrar Sandy Clendenen. 
"But in general, people are in good temper and cheerful." 


Enthusiasm permeated the air of what at times felt like 
a reunion. "In a way, it's a chance for neigh-
bors to see each other who may not other-
wise," said voter Breina Schain. "It is a 
meeting place where people can greet each 
other in a safe area where common interests 
are going on." The communal spirit seemed 
abnormal. While all insisted that Edgewood 
provided a decent place to live, the neigh-
borhood definitely did not convey a picture 
of urban harmony. More a neighbor than a 
politician, Alderwoman Liz McCormick 
had been busy explaining the various refer-
endum questions to voters. She listed what 
she considered Edgewood's three major 
problems: "prostitution, absentee landlords 
who don't maintain property, and crime 
including theft, car theft, break-ins, and 
drugs." But she quickly qualified her 
remark, "Not that the whole ward is ram-
pant with all of these." 


"This is a neighborhood in transition," 
said Schain. "I refuse to be nervous about 
my surroundings; however, I do feel it's 
dangerous to the point where it shouldn't 
be." Brian Pence (BK '96), who, like many 
Yale students, had spent several hours can-
vassing the neighborhood, remarked, 
"There's a lot of--maybe not fear-but at 
least nervousness. A lot of people didn't 
even want to open doors when we 
knocked." 


The increase in nervousness has sparked 
devotion to community rejuvenation 
efforts. In the last few years, an active 
blockwatch organization and the Edgewood 
Neighborhood Association (ENA) have 
contributed a great deal to stopping crime. 
They have also fought prostitution with the 
notorious, if inventive, "John-of-the-Week" 
campaign. Joseph Firine, the ENA presi-
