New Age Scribes 
In the Middle Ages, monastic 
scribes copied manuscripts by hand for 
six hours a day in rooms called scripto-
ria. They observed strict silence, but 
sometimes monks wrote thoughts in 
the margins of their work: "The parch-
ment is hairy," or "Now, I've written 
the whold thing: for Christ's sake give 
me a drink.'' In the days before the 
printing press, the monks, supported 
by the rich and powerful Catholic 
Church, served as the world's primary 
bookmakers. 


Today, books are typeset on com-
puters and most monks no longer 
double as scribes. Yet modern monas-
teries must support themselves. One 
monastery, the Holy Cross Abbey in 
Berryville, Virginia-home to 25 
Benedictine Cistercian monks-
has 
found a way to combine old traditions 
and new technology, as well as to pay 
the bills. They help the Yale Library 
with its number one customer request: 
to transfer more books into Orbis, the 
computerized card catalogue. 


Last January, Brother Benedict 
Simmonds of the Holy Cross Abbey; 
approached Monty Montee, head of 
cataloguing for Yale's libraries, and 
Fred Martz, head of database manage-
ment, with the idea of "The Electronic 
Scriptorium." The monks proposed to 
convert drawers of 3-by-5 index cards 
to computer files for loading into 
Orbis, a process called retrospective 
conversion, or recon for short. The 
librarians planned a pilot project to 
convert 10,000 Cross Campus 
records. "We did some comparative 
shopping with other vendors," said 
Martz. "When you calculate all the 
costs, this is the best approach." 


The Electronic Scriptorium is the 
latest twist in the monastery's unique 
economic history. In 1950, when 20 
monks founded the Holy Cross Abbey, 
they supported themselves by farming 
the 1 ,200 acres of monastery land and 
by baking Monastery brand bread. 


During the 60s, however, the number 
of monks decreased and they were 
forced to rent out the farm. "The bak-
ery became the center of our work and 
for many years bread was our prod-
uct," said Brother Simmonds. "But the 
bread economy has changed quite rad-
ically. In 1984 we began baking fruit-
cakes." The first year the monks baked 
1,500 fruitcakes. Now they bake 
30,000 annually, almost all of which 
they sell around Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. 


Their prodigious baking, however, 
created a logistical nightmare for the 
monks-how in Heaven's name to 
organize the distribution of 30,000 
fruitcakes in three months. Like many 
entrepreneurs in the 1990s, they 
bought a computer. But then the 
problem arose of what to do with the 
computer for the other nine months of 
the year. "We began to think of 
putting our monastic community back 
in the service of the humanitarian pur-
suits that monasteries have always 
served," said Brother Simmonds. It 
was at this point that the monks of the 
Holy Cross Abbey thought up the 
Electronic Scriptorium. 


One of the monks' tasks will be to 
check the public Orbis records against 
the library's Authority File, a list of 
names of authors in Library of 
Congress proper form. The monks 
will make sure, for example, that both 
Ular and P~au and Anna Karen ina will 
be found under Tolstoy, rather than 
one under Tolstoy and the other under 
Tolstoi. The monks have arranged to 
access Orbis directly, via the national 
computer network Internet, to do the 
job more quickly and cheaply than 
large commercial vendors. 


The monks will also create 10,000 
book records. For most books the 
monks can look up the record on a 
CD-ROM purchased from the Library 
of Congress. They will then load the 
record onto their computers, make any 
necessary changes, and save it on their 
hard drive. For books not on the CO-
ROM they will have to create records 
from scratch. Eventually they will 
transfer all the records to a magnetic 
tape, which will go to Yale to be 
copied into Orbis. 


Because the library has no money 
set aside for recon, after this pilot pro-
ject ends it has no definite plans to 
continue working with the monastery. 
"We have enough trouble keeping up 
with the new books that come in," 
said Martz. But Yale does receive 
donations specifically for recon-such 
as one for a project now underway to 
convert 40,000 volumes of Western 
Americana. If more donations come 
in, and if the monks satisfy librarian 
expectations, they could get a crack at 
some of the 5 million volumes still 
waiting to be entered into Orbis. 


In the meantime, the monks are 
busy creating an information system 
for the Johns Hopkins Medical 
Library and looking for other libraries 
in need of their services. For the Yale 
librarians, working with the monks 
instead of a large commercial vendor 
has given a different feel to recon. "It 
has some appropriateness for the 
library," said Martz. "In the old days 
monasteries were the keepers of the 
books. Many of the most famous, 
valuable, and rare books in Beinecke 
Library would have been long gone if 
monks hadn't taken care of them 
through the Middle Ages. It's coming 
full circle."
