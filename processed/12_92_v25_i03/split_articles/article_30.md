I 
pick flowers before every away game. Flowers or some 
leaves that I put next to my seat on the bus for luck. I 
also give some to Pete Swartz, our kicker. On this drizzly 
Friday I pick an extra big bunch of red and orange leaves 
because we are playing Dartmouth, the biggest game of our 
season so far. We gather outside of Lapham Field House, all 
of us players carrying our clunky blue travel bags over our 
shoulders. The trainers and equipment men load big blue 
boxes into the belly of the bus and the managers hand out 
bag lunches. Our coaches, a good many of whom are Italian 
and wear funny hats, stand outside, shuffling. We are all 
dressed in jacket and tie, which makes the large lineman 
types look a bit out of place and ill at ease. On the way up 
1-91 some of the guys sleep, snoring with Walkmans on 
their ears and textbooks across their laps. I watch the coun-
tryside and changing foliage of the Connecticut River 
Valley. 

The Connecticut River is a blue vein coursing through 
New England. In late October the valley's surrounding hills 
explode into orange and yellow and red. Fields are ochre 
with corn, or cold with dirt where the corn has already been 
harvested. One triangular-shaped field above Brattleboro is 
still tilled by horse. Small towns wedge themselves unobtru-
sively into bends in the river. From the bus, Hanover, New 
Hampshire is a few white houses and steeples pushing their

way through the trees. We exit the highway, cross the iron 
bridge, and the dark river that has followed us for the whole 
trip is left behind. 

Hanover swims with fall and with studepts hurrying to 
put up a wooden bonfire in the center of the town green. 
Invaders in buses, we disembark at the old brick locker 
rooms that sit across a small paved walk from Dartmouth's 
Memorial Stadium. A bunch of us wander across the grass, 
poking the turf with our leather dress shoes. The huge 
empty stands, covered with ivy, rise up on either side. I try 
to imagine what the stadium will look like tomorrow. Then 
a whistle-Coach Cozza thinks it's too wet for practice, so 
.we go to our hotel to "rest up." 

The Holiday Inn in White River Junction looks just 
like the Ramada in Easton, Pennsylvania, which looks just 
like whatever hot~! is outside of Cornell in upstate New 
York. These places always make me wonder about the life of 
professional athletes on the road. This Holiday Inn does 
have some quality attractions--on the way to our identical 
rooms we pass a huge indoor recreation area with a swim-
ming pool, a ping-pong table, a pool table, a putting green 
and even a railway caboose, maroon with Delaware-Hudson 
Line painted on the side. "How the hell'd this get in here?'' 
someone asks. None of us knows. I wish I could go for a 
walk. 

Most of the guys go to their 
rooms with the identical beds and 
watch TV. Ties pulled, feet up, 
waiting. Waiting specifically for 
dinner. Food comes at 5:30, along 
with a rush oflarge boys. Salad first, 
with iceberg lettuce. Spaghetti with 
meat sauce. Rolls that always run 
out. Chicken. Chocolate cake. A lot 
of my teammates have grumbled 
recently about the lack of red meat. 
After dinner we watch films. The 
same ones of Dartmouth we've 
watched all week. The only reason 
we meet is to meet, to keep the 
team together. Afterwards I walk 
through hollow corridors back to 
my room. I try to read and end up 
watching TV with Ed Kmak, my 
roommate and fellow receiver. I 
can't tell what's outside our closed

aturday morning breaks clear and cold. The wet from 
the day before barely sits on the ground. The air is 
Northern crisp-not quite cold enough to see your 
breath, but cold enough for longjohns. Cold enough to 
think of snow. In the hotel parking lot I watch the nipping 
wind pick up the leaves and blow them across the sky into 
the biting early morning smoke from distant farmhouses. 
We leave the hotel and drive the nervous 11 miles up to 
Hanover. 

Locker rooms during the week are loud and raucous. 
On game day an eerie silence descends. Players, half in dress 
clothes, half in uniform, sit on benches and read the pro-
gram. No one says a word. The only sounds are the hum of 
heavy metal coming through someone's Walkman and the 
never-ending flush of toilets from the bathroom. Some

The door outside occasionally blows open and lets in a 
short blast of bands and the assembling crowd.

the Lord's Prayer. Sometimes I wonder about the Jewish

Nerves. He finds a way of doing this right in the middle of 
the Lord's Prayer, or expertly between verses of the National 
Anthem. Against Dartmouth he does both. We are ready to 
play. 

The players trot out onto the field, and to Bill from his 
green press box above the stands, they look very small: The

the 30! A fumble! The bali squirts in the 
air, Mike Brown recovers in the air for 
Yale! Bill Gonillo yells into the mike. 
What a beginning. The fans hardly in 
their seats! But Yale fails to capitalize. 
The offense sputters and Pete Swartz, 
the kicker, misses a 39-yard field goal 
into the wind. 

Nothing has gone right for the Elis 
early on, Bill mumbles between bites of 
his corn chowder. This chowder is 
always the best thing about broadcast-
ing games up in Hanover, and today 
it's the only good thing. Yale's getting 
thoroughly dominated by Jay Fielder, 
Dartmouth's star quarterback. After 
the missed field goal, Yale's workhorse 
running back Keith Price fumbles. 
Fielder throws a strike to Greg 
Hoffmeister on the next play for a 
touchdown. And so goes the first half:

Fielder, going Long, for Brzica, catches 
the football three steps out of bounds at

Across his body-off baittnce--40 yards 
down field-a strike! Yale is down by 
23. Then· a final insult: Dartmouth's 
third-string fullback Chris Umshied 
rambles over 30 yards co the 10 on a 
fake punt with only 12 seconds left in 
the half. Fielder hits receiver David 
Shearer on the lase play before half-
time for a touchdown. The bands 
thump, the home crowd roars, and Bill 
tries to find something good to say: 
gonna know the words of "Its the Backs 
Go Marching By" because, uh, they sing 
it after every score here and thry've Mne

broadcast at around three in the morn-
ing New Haven time, and with Hawaii 
up by a bunch late in the third, the 
announcer heard all the radios on the 
East Coast go off with one big click. 

T

a fumble. But we can't seem co 
drive, and Dartmouth's quar-
terback can't seem t_? do anything 
wrong. As we huddle sweating and 
angry on the sideline, planning our 
next series, the crowd explodes and we 
turn our heads to see some receiver in 
green dashing down the sidelines. A 
deep voice crackles cheerfully over the 
public address system "Fielder co 
Bnica" or "Fielder to Hoffmeister." At 
half-time we walk off the field feeling 
like we've been punched in the stom-
ach, our air gone. Mystified, down-
turned faces in the locker room. Looks 
not met. Coach Cozza has two things 
to say to us: "Keep your poise, play 
with your hearts." We don't know 
what co chink, but out we 
go for the second half. 

Fall foliag~things look 
beautiful, but things aren't 
so beautiful right now and 
certainly the Yale Bulldogs 
have a heck of a mountain to 
climb if they want to get 
back in the game, Bill says 
into the mike as the second 
half starts. He chews on a 
complimentary hot dog 
and counts 17 different 
colors in the mountain 
behind the stands. Pretty 
impressive. Then Yale 
scores on an unobtrusive 
run by halfback Price. 
WELl field commentator 
Joe Benanto checks in: It's a 
start, hey. you have to score 
one before you score four, so 
you never know what's going 
to happen. Bill starts look-
