the result was an overwhelmingly Red October. TD cap-
tured championships in five of the eight fall sports. With 
531 Tyng Cup points, 135 more than second-place Stiles, 
TD is threatening to turn this year's race into a runaway. 
Calhoun, on the other hand, with only 181 points, could 
conceivably score fewer points this year than TD has tallied 
in the fall season alone. 


The stark athletic contrast between TD and Calhoun 
is, on the surface, difficult to explain. After all, Yale assigns 
freshpeople to their residential colleges at random, without 
regard to their athletic prowess or dedication. But when 
the intramural call goes out, TDers dutifully set aside 
books, musical instruments, and even other varsity sports 
to win glory for their college, while the 'Houn emits a col-
lective yawn. "lntramurals are a huge part of the identity 
of this college," said Kathryn Crump (TD '94), one of 
TO's intramural secretaries. "Even people who don't play 
identify with them." 


The personal commitment of some TDers to intramu-
rals rivals that of the most dedicated varsity athletes. Many 
often skip classes to participate. Past intramural secretaries 
have even scheduled all of their classes in the morning to 
minimize conflicts, Crump said. 


TD Master Robert Thompson, known affectionately 
to his students as "Master T," is the driving force behind 
TO's tradition of intramural success. Thompson values 
athletic competition as a unifying thread in a diverse col-
lege community. "lntramurals are such a beautiful way to 
bring people together," he said. "With the residential col-
lege system under bombardment, athletics bring people's 
interest back into the college. The playing fields enhance 
the dining hall and the life of the college as a whole." 


Thompson, a historian of New York culture, often 
brings celebrities to campus to celebrate Tyng Cup tri-
umphs. Past visitors have included musician David Byrne 
and film director Jonathan Demme. "He knows everyone," 
Dodge said. "This year he's promised 
to try to bring us Madonna." "If we 
win," Thompson said, "I promise the 
party of the century." 


Thompson's sideline antics in 
support of TD teams are the stuff of 
lege.nd. He once showed up to a 
women's soccer game wearing a red 
TD flag as a cape. 
On a hot 
September day, while cheering for the 
men's soccer team, he stripped from a 
business suit to boxer shorts. In past 
years, Thompson even played on TO's 
coed touch football team. "I made a 
touchdown once," he recalled, "and it 
was the thrill of my life. Too bad it 
was disqualified." 


TO's torrid rivalry with Ezra 
Stiles provides the fuel that sustains 
this high level of enthusiasm. "Stiles 
is the college that we have so much 
venom for," Crump said. The two 
powerhouses have won 1 0 of the last 
11 Tyng Cup championships, with 
Morse breaking the duopoly in 1987. 
For the last three years, TO has 
watched bitterly as irs rival captured 
the Tyng. "Stiles is a group that 
comes together as a result of the dire 
circumstance of living in an ugly 
building," Dodge said. "They are a

much larger college than TO, and 
they have little success at other 
endeavors." 


TD is, in fact, the smallest of 
Yale's residential colleges. With 376 
students, 70 fewer than Stiles, TO's 
success seems all the more remarkable. 
Yet Dodge admits that TO derives 
some advantage from the fact that 
freshpeople live in the college, since 
new students become immersed in the 
tradition right at the start of their Yale 
careers. 


Zealous TDers flock to the intra-
mural fields in droves. "Each ream 
has a core group of people, the mini-
mum amount needed to play, who 
come to every game," Crump said. 
"Others come pretty regularly." The 
biggest problem that captains of TO 
teams face is spreading playing time 
around to everyone who shows up to 
play. "Some people do get discour-
aged," Crump said. "Fifteen men 
once showed up ro fill three spots in a 
volleyball game." TO often intimi-
dates irs opponents through sheer 
numbers, 
according 
to 
Greg 
Mohrman, Calhoun intramural secre-
tary. "At their football games, there's a 
sea of red shirts on the sidelines," he 
said. 


In Calhoun, meanwhile, the race 
for the Tyng Cup is largely an exercise 
in apathy. Captains of Calhoun teams 
must scramble to find players on a 
day-to-day basis. "In other colleges, 
people tend to schedule their time 
around in tram urals," Mohrman said. 
"In Calhoun, it's just nor a priority." 
Intramural 
secretary 
Amanda 
Wheeland (CC '94) recalled that the 
hardest part of her job to dare h as 
been finding 10 ping-pong players for 
each of the season's 11 matches. 


W hat could possibly explain 
Calhoun's intramural ineptitude? 
Wheeland sees a correlation between 
the college's poor performance in the 
Tyng Cup race and its two-year stran-
glehold on the Gimbel Cup, the prize 
for the college whose students possess 
the highest overall GPA. "People in 
Calhoun do their work instead of 
play," she said. 


Recruiting women has been par-
ticularly difficult for Calhoun. 
"There are only three women in the 
college who consistently come out for 
intramurals," Mohrman said. Ellen 
Rothman (CC '94), a sometime 
Calhoun squash player, said that since 
so few women participate, matches 
frequently end in forfeit. "You never 
know if you're actually going to get to 


Calhoun Master Turan Onat, 
who as acting master of Stiles in 1990 
tasted the fruit ofTyng triumph, sens-
es an imminent turnaround in the for-
tunes of Calhoun intramurals. 


"Things are improving," he said. But 
he cautions that winning is not every-
thing. "As long as there is participa-
tion, my heart won't be broken," he 
admitted. 


While Calhoun struggles to avoid 
forfeit, TD teams improve from game 
to game and from season to season. 
Athletes in TD tend to stay commit-
ted to their teams, not only through-
out the season, but throughout their 
time at Yale. "Our men's touch foot-
ball team is awesome," said Ryan 
Williams (TD '95), a member of the 
coed squad. "They've been playing 
together for at least a year." TO's coed 
team has developed an inventory of 
alignments and plays to which new 
players are introduced at the begin-
ning of each season. Calhoun's coed 
team, according to Willits, must varyÂ· 
its strategy depending on who shows 
up for the game, and often settles for 
no strategy at all. 


On game day, experience and 
cohesion propel the TO juggernaut 
straight into the end zone. When 
Calhoun and TO clashed in men's and 
coed touch football, the red army 
marched to victory by twin scores of 
32-0. Shellshocked Calhoun foot-
baller Tom Connally (CC '94) recog-
nized Dodge, a fellow Oklahoman, 
from across the line of scrimmage. 
"He was an all-state quarterback in 
high school," Connally recalled. 


Crump believes TO's overwhelm-
ing success has led some outside of the 
college to erroneously conclude that 
TD has lost the sense that intramurals 
are supposed to be fun. "People think 
that TO is all about winning," she 
said. "They think we want to score as 
many points as possible. It hurts 
sometimes." Mohrman, who is also a 
referee for intramural football, noted 
that TO football games often get out 
of hand, not because of any malicious 
intent on TO's part, but because of 
the natural flow of the game. "They'll 
score a few touchdowns, get excited, 
score a few more, and all of a sudden 
the score is 49-0 and the other team is 
pissed."

One could probably guess at the 
divergent athletic fortunes of the two 
colleges simply from their respective 
intramural t-shirts. Calhoun's recently-
released shirts bear the self-deprecating 
slogan, "Nowhere to Go But Up." 
TO's t-shirts, by contrast, proudly bear 
the college's arcane rallying caJl, "Ashe!" 
"It's our bloodcurdling battle cry," 
Crump said. "Half the people in TO 
don't even know what it means." 


If TDers maintain the intensity 
they exhibited this fall, they could 
finally make good on the promise 
borne on the backside of their t-shirts. 
It could, indeed, be a TO Tyng. 


Meanwhile, this year looks to be an 
unpleasant one for intramural enthusi-
asts in Calhoun. "I'd love to see the 
'Houn emerge, phoenixJike, to chal-
lenge us," said Thompson, who once 
served as acting master of Calhoun. 


Mohrman, however, has slightly less 
mythical goals. ''I'd like to see us get 
out of last place and get competitive," 
he said. In the bifurcated, Cold War 
world of intramural athletics, being 
competitive may be the best for which 
the 'Houn, or any other college stand-
ing between Stiles and TO, can hope.
