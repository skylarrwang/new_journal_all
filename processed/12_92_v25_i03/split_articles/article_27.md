much everything to stop this. But still 
he kept calling me." 

The teaching assistant's pursuit of 
Sarah affected her academics. She 
could not concentrate in section 
because she wondered if he directed 
his comments to the class or to her 
alone. "An obsessive male is hard 
enough to deal with in the social 
realm," Sarah said. "But now the 
obsessive male is also giving you a 
grade during the week. Your academic 
and social lives collapse into each 
other." 

After learning of the board from 
her college dean, Sarah spoke ro a 
board member and filed an informal 
complaint. The board contacted her 
teaching assistant, informed him of 
Sarah's identity, and listened to his side 
procedure usually entails a hearing at 
which both parties state their cases 
before a committee appointed by the 
dean. 

'1 did everything to stop 
this. But still he kept 
calling me. " 

The committee then submits a 
report to the dean, who decides on a 
final resolution. Action by the dean 
can include oral warnings, reprimands, 
or review of disputed grades. If the 
dean believes that a harassment inci-
dent merits more serious punishment, 
he or she can refer it to higher authori-
ings are more rigid and impersonal, 
and the student relinquishes control to 
the administration. 

Board members believe that they 
provide a viable alternative to these 
more formal procedures. 

"No 
aggrieved student has ever come to me 
whose problems have been overlooked 
by the board or not taken seriously," 
said Betty Trachtenberg, Dean of 
Student Affairs of Yale College. 

Board members regret that stu-
dents who do not know much, if any-
thing, about the board can have mis-
perceptions about its level of formality. 

"The use of the word 'board' really 
misrepresents how informal and con-
cerned this group is," said Tetzlaff. 

Confusion about the murky 
boundaries of sexual harassment con-
of the story. The board keeps all pro-
ceedings confidential, but identifies 
the complainant to the alleged harasser 
for the sake of fairness to all parties. 

The board aims to resolve matters 
as quickly as possible, bur can rake no 
action without the student's permis-
sion. "We do not want the srudent to 
lose control of the situation," said 
Parker. The board may arrange for a 
student to change sections, or require 
offenders to write letters of apology. In 
Sarah's case, she switched sections, and 
her teaching assistant received a warn-
ing from his department. 

If the board fails to resolve a prob-
lem, or if a student files a formal com-
plaint, the Dean of Yale College han-
dles the case. Once the dean steps in, 
the student no longer controls the 
handling of the com plaine. The dean's 
ties. The ultimate power to dismiss an 
instructor lies with the University 
Tribunal, a body whose action must be 
authorized by the president and which 
has never met in its 23 year history. 

Cases that involve student com-
plaints against other students come 
before the Executive Committee, 
which handles all infractions of the 
Undergraduate Regulations. The 
Executive Committee may authorize 
removal from campus housing or put a 
student on probation. 

But few students initiate formal 
complaints, although they allow for 
severe punitive action. According to 
Valerie Stanley, Assistant Director of 
Yale's Office for Equal Opportunity 
Programs, the lengthy process and the 
publicity of a formal procdure intimi-
dates people. In addition, the proceed-

uibutes to student reluctance to lodge 
any kind of complaint with the uni-
versity. Another student, Mike*, who 
was harassed by his teaching assistant, 
did not consider the situation serious 
enough to turn to the administration. 

Mike's instructor repeatedly urged 
him to come in during office hours, 
and then came to Mike's room one 
night to return a lab. "I worked so 
hard on these labs bur he graded me so 
harshly. I kept wondering what was 
going on," Mike said. Unable to 
ignore the situation, Mike dropped the 
course. But about a month later his 
teaching assistant showed up at his 
door, dressed up and holding a flower. 
After a nervous exchange the teaching 
assistant left. Mike found the incident 
awkward and unwelcome, yet doubts 
that the teaching assistant's actions fall 
under the definition of sexual harass-
ment 

Mike's reluctance reflects the diffi-
culty in determining the point at 
which 
an 
instructor's behavior 
becomes a violation of a student's aca-
demic and personal life. Even Sarah 
did not immediately label her experi-
ence as sexual harassment. "I thought 
that sexual harassment was only a case 
involving an ultimatum, like, 'If you 
don't sleep with me, I'll fail you or fire 
you,'" she said. 

Some students believe that univer-
sity policy and awareness efforts have 
failed to clear up the confusion for 
both students and instructors. Becky 
Young (ES '94), co-coordinator of 
women breaking the silence, a group 
formed to raise awareness about sexual 
new teaching assistants provides little 
opportunity to deal with the issue in 
depth. 

In response to the need for more 
thorough training, a group of graduate 
students established a series of work-
shops called Working at Teaching. 
One workshop addressed "crushes" of 
students on teachers and vice versa, 
and the problems of favoritism and 
harassment that arise. According to 
Matt Dowling (GRD '94), these 
workshops fill a gap in the p resent 
training system. H owever, not all 
teaching assistants attend this pro-
gram. 

The efforts of groups like 
Working at Teaching signal a positive 
step in the battle against sexual harass-
ment. As this national issue hits cam-
assault and harassment, claimed that 
few students actually read Yale's sexual 
harassment pamphlet and that even 
fewer freshpeople attend the optional 
discussion during orientation. "We 
call on the administration to take a 
more aggressive approach to this 
issue," said Young. 

Faculty and staff do not receive 
much guidance about Yale's sexual 
harassment policy either. In accor-
dance with state law, the Office of 
Equal Opportunity Programs periodi-
cally runs workshops for super~isors, 
some of whom are faculty members. 
But the administration does not spon-
sor workshops for all teachers. Every 
teaching assistant receives a handbook 
that includes a section on sexual 
harassment and states that they should 
not date students. But orientation for 
pus, Yale shows signs of increased 
responsiveness. 

Deputy 
Provost 
Charles Long plans to revise sexual 
harassment grievance procedures to 
clarify policies and the steps to file a 
complaint. And Tetzlaff claims that 
despite campus confusion over the 
university's policy and grievance pro-
cedures, Yale considers sexual harass-
ment a very serious matter. "From 
what I have seen, people are very com-
mitted to the board," she said. 

"There's a commitment in the univer-
sity that students should not have to 
deal with sexual harassment."
