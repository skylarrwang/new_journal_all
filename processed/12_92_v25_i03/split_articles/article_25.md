Asserting that Yale officials ignored her complaints at that 
time, Joost renewed her charges this fall. Also, history and 
American studies professor Mario Garcia left Yale this sum-

had harassed one of his graduate students. 
In a recent Yale Daily News article, ten of 30 female 
graduate students interviewed said they knew of other inci-

graduate school. National numbers back up their claims. 
According to the Association of American Colleges, 20 to 
30 percent of undergraduates and even more graduate stu-
dents experience harassment from instructors. 
The number of Yale students who report such incidents 
falls far short of national statistics and word-of-mouth 
reports, however. According to physics professor Peter 
Parker, who convenes the Yale College Grievance Board for 
Student Complaints of Sexual Harassment, the number of 
complaints received by the board has ranged from 12 ro 24 
a year. Last year the board received almost no complaints. 
"There's a great deal of frustration," said Parker, "knowing 
and hearing about so many more cases out there that never

At the beginning of each academic year, the grievance 
board places pamphlets that explain its functions and proce-
