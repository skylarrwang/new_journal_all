Cari/Jonn~r Bm Wtoarn (MC '93) survtys his domain from lofty Harkness Tower. 

Nineteen Yale students have a very special set of keys. 
The first key unlocks the entryway door of 
Harkness Tower, and the second opens the door to 
a '"harrow spiral staircase. The students use the third in the 
middle of the dark and damp stairwell. Then they climb 
and climb, past the tower clock and the pigeons, and use the 
fourth and final key to unlock a grate that leads to the open 
air and the bells of the tower. Higher than the bells, 286 
steps from the ground, they reach the top of Harkness. Far 
from sections, papers, and exams, they can see all of New 
Haven and, in the right weather, as far as Long Island. 

These 19 students make up the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, 
who climb Harkness daily to chime the hour and enjoy the 
height, the view, and the power to make the entire campus 
listen to their music. 

The carillon tradition began in 17th century Holland. 
When the central town clock rang the hour, townspeople 
often missed the first few beats, so the bell-ringers began to 
chime a little tune to capture the town's attention before 
they rang out the time. Carillon playing declined during the 
18th century, when many a town's bells were melted down 
to make armaments for the French Revolution. But a 20th 
century surge of interest, largely in the United States, led to 
the rearrangement of many classical pieces for the carillon as 
well as the composition of new runes. 

The bells in Yale's beloved Harkness played a large role 
in the carillon revival. Builders completed the tower at the 
end of World War I, and in 1921 a steamer brought 14 
newly-cast bells from England to New Haven. In 1964 
Elenor Crofut gave Yale the additional upper 40 bells need-
ed to make a full carillon. 

The Yale carillon, a keyboard instrument like the 
organ, spans four and a half octaves and has 54 hand keys 
and 28 foot pedals. The keys attach to clappers hung in the 
tower via thin steel rods. The clappers increase in weight as 
the notes get lower-
the clapper bells attached to the high 
notes weigh about 200 pounds, while the lowest bell weighs 
almost seven tons. One plays the instrument by hitting the 
keys with loosely clenched fists or by pressing on the foot 
pedals. Since the pedals play the same notes as the lower 
half of the hand notes, two players can perform together 
using only the hand keys. 

Though an official college organist played the original 
bells, during the 1940s Yale College students took over the 
job and played the chimes five times a day for 15 minutes 
per ring. When Yale acquired a full carillon, the Yale Guild 
of Carillonneurs was officially founded.
