defense holds 
Dartmouth to a field goal. Yale's Matt 
Fahrney runs back a long return. Price

time Mills dives over the end line. Bill 
leans forward now, into the game. It's 
not out of the realm of possibility, he says 
uncertainly. A comeback is in the air, 
the wind picks up and the home 
crowd, quieted, grows nervous as the 
fall shadows lengthen. The Yale band 
bumps happily, "March, march on 
down the field," and the Yale defense 
holds again, bringing Fielder to earth. 
Yale has the ball once more, driving. 
The offensive line is opening up holes 
for Price, who cuts back expertly, div-
ing for extra yardage. Yale reaches the 
Dartmouth two, the quarter comes to 
an end, and Bill shouts: Don't go anywhere! 


In the third period something hap-
pened, an intangible change, 
though I'm not sure what it was. 
Maybe the weather. The fall afternoon 
became full of wind, blustery leaves 
danced across the field, shadows 
spread towards us from the stands and 
press box, and thousands of people, 
some ringing the end zones and sitting 
on the grass, crowded around. 

Something blew us down the field. It 
was a moment of fullness: we were all 
inside of the game. And for a moment, 
I thought we had a chance to win. 
Yale scores on the first play of the 
fourth quarter. It's now Dartmouth 
33, Yale 21. Bill clutches the mike: 
plenty of time, plenty of time here. 
Things become crazy, possible. The 
white uniforms on the Yale bench 
jump in the sun. Dartmouth has the 
ball: Fielder at the 45- lofts one 
up--has a receiver--Clifford--makes 
the catch at the 20-Oh!--breaks the 
tackle there and ... Danny Urban hit 
him as soon as he caught the ball but 
Urban is getting up slow ... It was a 
tremendous hit, but the Yale player is 
the one hurt. He limps off. In the 
next play Fielder throws to a leaping 
Brzica in the left corner of the end 
zone. Touchdown. The Dartmouth 
side sighs with relief. Oh, that is a 
back-breaker. 

But Yale 
is 
not through. 
Quarterback Mills engineers another 
drive and slides across the end line. 
Swartz lines up for an onside kick-
and botches it, completely missing 
the ball. The Yale side groans, and so 
does Bill: Oh boy, that was absolutely 
horrible play. The clock ticks and the 
game beats with last minute despera-
tion. Dartmouth moves down the 
field after the botched kick and misses 
a field goal-but Yale has an extra 
man on the field and the drive contin-
ues 
because 
of the 
penalty. 
Inexcusable! The battered and grass-
stained 
white 
defense 
holds 
Dartmouth on the one- yard line, but 
time is not with Yale. Their last drive 
ends with a long interception, the ball 
fluttering desperately down the field 
only to fall into the hands of a green 
uniform. The gun sounds, fans pour 
onto the field and Bill, up in the 
booth, shakes his head. That would've 
been something. 

Then the final gun, shaking hands 
with Dartmouth at midfield, and the 
solitary walk back to the locker room. 
Now the field lies empty and I 
stand outside, hair wet from the 
shower, body tired, eyeblack taken 
off, tie back on. A large radio man 
and a few reporters with notebooks 
hover around the locker room door, 
waiting for the coach or the odd player, 
and the final shafts of the sun 
jump through the tips of the trees 
over the deserted field. At moments 


And then it's over. The field 
stands alone, battered, covered 
in shadow. A program bounces 
along the sidelines in the wind. 
Memories of our fallen comeback 
dance through my mind: a lucky pass, 
a missed kick, a groan, huge and 
unfathomable, as we turned our 
sweaty faces to the clock in the end 
zone, pleading with time to slow. 
like this, in the waning light of a lost 
game on a fall day in Hanover, New 
Hampshire, I know why I love foot-
ball, and I know that I will remember 
these days when I am old. I shoulder 
my blue bag and walk back to the 
bus.
