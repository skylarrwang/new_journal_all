EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The· article "Women's Clinics in 
Crisis" in the Sept. 4 issue is mislead-
ing in stating that "Women's Health 
Services and Planned Parenthood 
receive less in federal subsidies" than 
community health centers, "although 
they treat comparable numbers of low-
. 
, 
mcome patients. 

While it may be true that some 
community health centers receive 
more federal grants than these 
women's clinics, it is unlikely that the 
women's clinics see as many low-
income patients or have the same over-
all volume of business. As providers of 
comprehensive preventive and primary 
care, community health centers see 
people of all ages and genders and are 
especially dedicated to serving low-
income populations. In 1991, for 
example, Hill Health Center served 
nearly 15,000 people, 72 percent of 
whom were under the poverty level. 
Of the nearly 8,000 females seen by · 
the Center in 1991, some 3,700 were 
women of child-bearing age. Seventy-
seven percent of the 566 women wing 
the Center's family planning service in 
1991 were at or below the poverty 
level. Another indicator of volume is 
that our OB-Gyn Department record-
ed 5,340 medical visits in 1991. 

In the fiscal year that ended June 
30, 1991, about 25 percent of the Hill 
Health Center's income came from 
federal grants-not 64 percent as the 
article stated. It must be remembered 
that the range of problems addressed 
by community health centers is 
broad-AIDS, homelessness, sub-
stance abuse, teenage pregnancy, 
infant mortality, immunizations, 
chronic 
and 
episodic 
illness. 

Consequently, our opportunities (and 
competition) for federal and state 
grants to meet these needs are greaL 

Looking generally at federal subsi-
dies, it should be said that another 37 
percent of our revenue in 1991 came 
from patient fees, of which Medicaid 
was a sizeable chunk. Thw, it is true 
that community health centers are 
heavily subsidized by the federal gov-
ernment, but their mission of provid-
ing first-class care to the poor requires 
substantial public funding in the 
absence of private initiatives.

**Title: Corrections**
**Author: The New Journal**

Our Oct. 16 story "The Struggle to 
Respond" failed to state that Yale's pol-
icy toward Response and other under-
graduate peer counseling groups strict-
ly respects the groups' confidentiality 
policies. At no time do university offi-
cials ask peer counselors for any kind 
of details about or names of their 
counselees. 

Our Oct. 16 story "The King of 
Chapel Street" referred to the negative 
impact that the proposed Hamden 
Cou.n Mall would have on downtown 
New Haven's retail district. However, 
Hamden's town zoning board has 
rejected the plans for the mall, so the 
concerns raised in the article are moot. 
Also, the article asserted that New 
Haven would have to raise taxes to pay 
for the proposed Taubmen Mall. This 
is not the case; the mall will be funded 
by state dollars.

Oct. 16 issue was taken by Valerie
