Almost 50 percent of New 
Haven's youth drop out of school and 
an estimated 10,000 of the city's chil-
dren live in poverty, but the financial-
ly-strapped city cannot afford to pay 
for new youth programs. An innova-
tive public-private collaboration called 
Leadership, Education and Athletics in 
Partnership for New Haven Youth 
(LEAP) has stepped in to fill the gap. 

With a free summer camp operated 
out of several New Haven housing 
projects, LEAP aims to expand the life 
opportunities of inner-city children. 
Community 
activist 
Anne 
Calabresi and several friends raised 
over $176,000 from local corpora-
tions, foundations, universities, and 
the Federal government to fund the 
free eight-week day camp. LEAP used 
the funds to pay for transportation, 
educational supplies, and training and 
salaries for 60 counselors, chosen from 
New Haven area colleges and high 
schools. 

Groups of eight children ranging 
from 7 to 13 years old, one senior 
counselor, and one junior counselor 
spent three mornings a week in a class-
room. They explored skills like prob-
lem-solving and decision-making 
through hands-on learning projects in 
reading, science, and math. The 
groups spent the rest of the week in 
activities and outings around New 
Haven. Counselors also took children 
on one week-long trip to either 
Boston, Toronto, or Washington, 
D.C. 

LEAP gathered resources and 
recruited students for the program 
through extensive community net-
working. The program obtained class-
room space at the Lincoln-Bassett 
public school, and Yale provided 
campers with the use of a pool in 
Payne-Whitney Gymnasium for five 
afternoons a week. David Echols, exec-
utive director of the New Haven 
Housing Authority, secured vacant

units in housing projects for senior 
counselors. By living in the areas 
where they worked, counselors could 
establish closer ties not only with the 
children but with their parents, whose 
support LEAP believes is crucial to the 
success of the program. 

The 240 children who participat-
ed in LEAP had not previously experi-
enced many of the activities the pro-
gram provided. "If I wasn't doing 
LEAP, I wouldn't be doing nothing in 
the summer," said Tashema Cloud, 9. 
Some of the campers sold drugs before 
the program began. "A few kids that 
eventually ended up in the program 
we literally pulled in off the street cor-
ner," said project coordinator Matt 
Klein (BR '93). Counselors stuffed 
mailboxes with information and

depended on word-of-mouth to 
recruit most of the LEAP participants. 
"I started going because all my friends 
were going," said Sherrea Meyers, 12. 

While camper recruitment may 
have been flexible, LEAP selected 
counselors through an extremely rigor-
ous application process. The board 
sought as role models for the children 
high school and college students who 
had made it out of the projects them-
selves. "We didn't want to hear about 
'I want to do this, I want to do that' 
from our applicants," said program 
director H enry Fernandez (LAW '93), 
"but rather about their interest in the 
kids." 

LEAP recruited junior counselors 
with similar qualifications in mind. 
Tara Waller, currently a senior at the 
High School in the Community, heard 
about LEAP from a teacher. "She knew 
I would be interested because I'd 
already been involved in tutoring bilin-
gual kids after school," Waller said. 
Like all LEAP juniol' counselors, Waller 
comes from the New H aven area, and 
she continues to meet with her campers 
six hours a week outside of school. 

According to Klein, most junior and 
senior counselors keep in contact with 
their students throughout the year and 
will return for the second summer in 
1993. 

During the rw<rweek training peri-
od, counselors organized an entire cur-
riculum for their students that included 
no homework besides journal entries. 
Instead, counselors focused on main-
taining campers' attention through par-
ticipation-oriented activities. One 
group wrote a play about growing up in 
the projects, which they performed for 
Senators C hristopher Dodd (D-CT) 
and Joseph Lieberman (O-CT ). 

Another group designed a model city in 
which campers chose their own profes-
sions. Although counselors enjoyed the 
creative process of designing a curricu-
lum, LEAP plans to give them more 
structure next year. The program will 
also train counselors to identifY learn-
ing disabilities and to cope with abused 
children. 

In 1993, LEAP will add one more 
camp site and double the number of 
children involved in the program. 
LEAP hopes to save as many New 
H aven children as possible from the 
dangers of the streets. "If we're not 
aggressive with our programs and don't 
take some risks," said Calabresi, "we 
will continue to lose our children. "
