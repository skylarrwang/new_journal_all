**Women's Studies: Fighting for Respect**

L
ast spring, Yale made an unprecedented tenure offer. 
The university offered a senior position to associate 
professor Emily Honig, breaking with tradition by 
creating a joint appointment for her in the women's studies 
program and the history department. Many students and 
faculty saw the appointment as a response to long-standing 
demands for tenured faculty in women's studies. "This is 
significant because we didn't have a senior faculty in 
women's studies," said women's studies major Carissa Aoki 
(ES '93). Only by hiring its own senior faculty, women's 
studies supporters argued, could the program attain the 
level of continuity that most departments and large pro-
grams at Yale enjoy. 

Yet Honig passed up the university's offer for a tenured 
position at the prestigious women's studies department of 
the University of California at Santa Cruz, and Yale has no 
plans to replace her either this year or next. Until the uni-
versity acts, the women's studies program is back to the 
small-program status of two assistant professorships, much 
to the chagrin of its students. 

Some students believe that the lack of university sup-
port and the negative attitude toward women's studies that 
they have encountered at Yale comes from a general disre-
spect towards interdisciplinary programs. "There's a basic 
attitude about all alternative disciplines that they are not as 
rigorous as traditional ones," said women's studies major 
Chani Waterhouse (SM '93). According to Laura Wexler, 
the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) of women's 
studies, students say they have been criticized for their 
involvement in the program. "We get reports that people 
are made to justify their choice of a 
women's studies class, much less a 
major," she said. 

Women's studies faculty claim that 
the youth of the program puts pressure 
on it to prove itself in the established 
realm of academia. "Like American 
studies in the 1940s, women's studies 
is still emerging," said Patricia Pierce, 
former associate dean of Yale College. 

Most importantly, the feminist focus 
of women's studies has made the pro-
gram one of the most controversial 
disciplines at Yale. 

As women's studies majors grapple 
with the bias against their chosen field, 
they also must navigate through the 
pitfalls of their program. Students 
express discontent with several aspects 
of their major, including course offer-
ings, advising, and the structure of the 
program. At the root of these prob-
lems lies the high rate of faculty 
turnover. As they struggle to make the 
program work for them, students must 
piece together programs of study from 
a list of courses not under their major's 
control. As a result, they question the 
level of university support for the 
major. 

S
ince its inception in 1979, 
women's studies has grown 
steadily in terms of course offer-
ings and student involvement. The 
program incorporates courses from 
many different departments, drawing 
faculty from a range of disciplines. 
The total number of courses focusing 
on women, including women's 
studies classes, classes in other depart-
ments, and college seminars, rose from 
15 in 1976 to 52 last year. In the same 
15-year span, the number of students 
taking courses on women increased 
from 366 to 1216. 

The enrollment explosion in 
women's studies classes reflects grow-
ing student interest in the field. 
"Feminist scholarship is the cutting 
edge right now in a lot of different dis-
ciplines like history, anthropology, and 
literature," said major Waterhouse. 
"Doing the major means taking classes 
with some of the smartest and best 
thinkers at Yale and being exposed to a 
way of looking at issues that's complex 
and inclusive. It's an incredibly vital 
area of study." 

Yet expansion has come with 
drawbacks. In the past several years, 
some majors have voiced concern 
about the structure of the curriculum. 
Because of the high rate of faculty 
turnover, course offerings in the major 
change from year to year. The specific 
nature of the major's requirements-
five core courses, seven courses in the 
student's area of concentration, one 
course outside that concentration, and 
the senior essay-makes it difficult to 
build a curriculum that can withstand 
the frequent shifts. "It turns into a 
crap shoot whether or not you have 
enough courses to fill the require-
ments," said major Tracy Turner (ES 
'93). And because they must concen-
trate in a particular area of study, some 
majors find it difficult to choose class-
es that apply to both women's studies 
and their area of interest. 

According to history professor 
Nancy Cott, a founder of the women's 
studies program and its current chair, 
consistency in course offerings is not 
the program's most important con-
cern. She sees the constant change as a 
positive influence on the program. "I 
think in a new area like women's stud-
ies that is multi-disciplinary," she said, 
"this kind of differentiation from year 
to year can actually add a lot of vitality 
to the subject and to the teaching of 
the subject." 

But some students disagree. 
"There are times when it's awkward in 
class because we are all coming from 
different backgrounds," said Turner. 
She believes that the major should be 
restructured to focus more on the his-
tory of feminist thought. "There 
should be more theory after the intro-
ductory course so that all the women's 
studies majors work from a basic core 
knowledge," she said. 

Cott believes that exposing stu-
dents to several perspectives on 
women's studies takes precedence over 
creating a common background. "We 
hope to provide students with what we 
see as necessary or minimal exposure 
to different kinds of approaches within 
women's studies," she said. 

Advising, like course offerings, 
suffers from discontinuity. In 
the past five or six years, the 
women's studies DUS has changed 
every year. The DUS's responsibilities 
include teaching the introductory 
course, advising, and performing 
administrative tasks. "We only have 
two junior positions in women's stud-
ies, and sometimes one of those people 
is on leave," Con said. "Also, no one 
wants to be DUS all the time." 

The program has attempted to 
bring in faculty members from other 
departments to act as DUS. But out-
of-program professors have no incen-
tive to take on the extra work load and 
rotate into the position only briefly. 
"When we borrow a faculty member 
from a department to be DUS, it's just 
about inevitable that that person will 
only be able to do it for one year," said 
Cott. 

The turnover in the position of 
DUS and other faculty has hurt the 
advising available to some undergrad-
