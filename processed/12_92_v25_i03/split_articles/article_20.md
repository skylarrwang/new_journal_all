shared 
power 
between the Vietnamese-installed 
government in Phnom Penh, two 
rebel factions, and the Khmer Rouge. 
Boua was horrified by the news. "My 
God," she remembered thinking, 
"they're coming back to power." To 
prevent this possibility, she had 
helped establish a lobby group to 
pressure the U.S. government to 
withdraw its support from the Khmer 
Rouge. The Campaign to Oppose the 
Return of the Khmer Rouge 
(CORKR), an advocacy group sup-
ported by over 40 relief organizations, 
set up shop in Washington, D.C. in 
1989. Boua is a member of the 
CORKR Board of Advisors, a body 
that includes dignitaries like Haing S. 
Ngor and Elie Wiesel. "Chanthou is 
an adviser, an activist, a fundraiser, 
and a cheerleader," said CORKR 
executive director Craig Etcherson. 
"The well-being of the Cambodian 
people is something she's extremely 
passionate about." 
Boua cares for Cambodia on 
both global and local levels. But she 
reserves her greatest energies to help 
individuals: the women and children, 
the grandmothers, aunts, mothers, 
daughters, and sons of Cambodia. 
For 
Boua, 
the fight 
to end 
Cambodia's suffering is a personal 
battle. She will allow neither individ-
uals nor world powers to forget what 
has happened to her country. And she 
has begun educating her two chil-
dren, ages eight and five , about 
Khmer culture and the horrors of the 
Khmer Rouge. "They already know," 
she said, "about Pol Pot."
