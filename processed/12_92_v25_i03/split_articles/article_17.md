·p or the weekday warriors of Timothy Dwight and Ezra 
Stiles, the annual race for the Tyng Cup has become a 
Cold War of athletic enmity. The two intramural 
superpowers stare each other down from opposite sides of 
the Yale map, while the other ten colleges struggle in the 
shadow of their monumental rivalry. If fall intramural 
results hold true, this should be the year that TO's red-clad 
army finally recaptures the coveted Cup, which has spent 
the last three years in the clutches of the enemy. 
Meanwhile, no college has been more quickly ousted from 
the Tyng fray than Calhoun, whose beleaguered intramu-
raletes find themselves in an increasingly familiar posi-
tion--dead last. 
The seeds of fortune in this year's race for the Tyng 
were sown during last year's intramural campaign. 
Calhoun spent virtually the entire year deeply mired in last 
place, finishing too far behind the other colleges even to get 
mud kicked in its face. With enthusiasm at a record low, 
this year promised to be an uphill batcle for Calhoun intra-
mural die hards. "It's a cyclical pattern," said Mari Willits 
(CC '94), captain of coed football. "People won't come out 
for intramurals if they think we're going to lose, and they 
definitely won't come out if they think we're going ro for-
feit." 
TD, meanwhile, after struggling for the majority of the 
year, made a late spring charge for last year's Tyng that con-
sumed the entire college, according to intramural secretary 
Chris Dodge (TD '93). TDers hung red flags and t-shins 
out of their windows to show their solidarity as the gap 
with Stiles narrowed. Eventually, TD came up just short 
and had to settle for a close second. 
Last spring's enthusiasm carried over into this year, and 
DECEMBER 4· 1992.
