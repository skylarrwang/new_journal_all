Yale's bell-ringers bang out tunes like Bach's "Toccata and Fugue," Chopin's "Funeral March," "Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead," and the "Pink Panther." In addition to performing for the Yale community, they play national anthems for visiting dignitaries and do $75 gigs for weddings. 

The guild is currently planning a spring trip to Belgium, where they will visit a few of the original carillon towers and acquaint themselves with the history of their instrument.


Guild members choose their own tunes and sometimes improvise during their rings. The group has a library of music into which players can delve, and the selection includes Bach fugues, gospel hymns, Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven," and the Sesame Street theme. Bernstein learned quickly that some student listeners display their preferences quite clearly. "Last year a group of Branford students would post hate notices whenever I played the Beatles," she said.


One further attraction of carillonning is its distance from stereotypical Yale activities. Wearn and Scott noted that since carillonning is not exactly a mainstream thing, guild members tend to be a little on the, well, strange side. "It's not that we're eccentric," said Scott. "But you could say that we all have our eccentric aspects."


While the student community below walks around campus, enjoying, ignoring, or even hating the music that screams from the tower, the carillonneurs sit far above playing music with the sense of ultimate control. Although offbeat and perhaps a little mysterious to most, guild members find carillonning to be an empowering experience. "It's cataclysmic," said Wearn. "You're sitting under 40 tons of bells, playing music you love, and the heavens open up!"


Guild membership depends on musical skill and diligent practice. None of the present carillonneurs played the instrument before coming to Yale. Beginners study under experienced guild members during the fall semester and audition before winter break. Student carillonneurs ring the bells for a half-hour twice a day, at 12:00 and 5:00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday, and at 2:00 and 5:00 p.m. on Sundays. Carillonneurs also play special theme rings, like their Halloween show, in which members performed for the construction of the tower, and from Crofut, support Yale's carillon activities. The Harkness funds maintain the tower and bells, while the Crofut money provides the guild with an operating budget. 

Membership in the guild comes with the appealing perk of access to the top of Harkness Tower. "It's a great escape from Yale to sit up in the tower all by yourself," said Molly Scoville (DC '93), co-chair of the guild. "It's one of the few places you can really be alone." 

Despite their possessive feelings about the tower, members often agree to share access to it. "At times I get phone calls from people I hardly know because they find out that I have a key to the tower," said Mira Bernstein (BK '94). "But I almost always take them up there because I think it's a really worthwhile experience." 

Carillonneurs' sense of privilege also extends to the act of bell-ringing itself. "One of our applicants called it 'a mix of power and anonymity,' and it totally is," said co-chair Ben Wearn (MC '93). Bell-ringing offers its devotees a rare opportunity for total control. "Playing my first ring was terrifying," said Ted Scott (SY '93). "But once you dare to play, there's really nothing anyone can do to stop you."
