McCarthy 
Immediately following the naming of the 
Democratic Town Committee's slate of 
delegates to the June 22 state convention, 
Town Chairman Arthur Barbieri lauded 
the committee's unanimous support of 
President Johnson and stated that the 
delegates represented the "many, many 
segments of the city's Democratic or-
ganization." 

When Barbieri rebuffed attempts to have 
at least eight of New Raven's 34 dele-
gates to the state convention pledged to 
Senator Eugene McCarthy, he was run-
ning the risk of a primary fight which 
would strain personal and organizational 
relationships in the Democratic party. 
"If there is a contest," said Barbieri at 
the time, "I'll have my best foot forward." 

Barbieri's organization has not lost a 
primary fight since he has been Town 
Chairman, and has nipped many primary 
fights in the bud with the help of Con-
necticut's often-revised primary laws. 

Barbieri's pro-Johnson delegates are 
going to be a tough bunch to unseat in the 
April 9 primary. The party's slate includes 
Mayor Richard Lee, his long-time sup-
porter and ambassador-at-large Demo-
cratic National Committeeman John 
Golden, and a host of office holders and 
organization Negroes. 

These "many, many segments" of the 
local Democratic machine pale, however, 
in comparison to the pro-Johnson dele-
gates put forward by the party in H artford. 
On the Hartford ticket are Governor John 
Dempsey, party leader John Bailey and 
Senator Abraham Ribicoff, among others. 

As a long time observer of the political 
situation in Connecticut put it, the party 
has everything on the line in the big city 
primaries. If many of the seventeen or 
so primaries in Connecticut are lost or if 
the unit rule binding delegates to the 
national Democratic convention in Chi-
cago is dented by even one McCarthy 
delegate, the whole Democratic party 
organization in Connecticut would fall 
under a shadow and perhaps be eventually 
repudiated by reformers within the party. 

At its March 5 open convention the 
New Haven McCarthy group put forth 34 
delegates from the community of New 
Haven as well as from the university. 
Prominent among the university sup-
porters are Professors James Tobin and 
John Blum, as well as Chester Kerr. While 
much of the money, help and initial en-
thusiasm naturally emanated from Yale, 
the local campaign to unseat the town 
committee's delegates will quickly be for-
gotten and may even prove a liability in 
terms of state and national policy if the 
rank and file Democratic voters in the city 
do not consider a vote for McCarthy a 
realistic alternative. 

Consequently, significant efforts have 
been made to obtain a commitment from 
prominent individuals and liberally 
oriented groups in the city to join in the 
McCarthy campaign. 

Among the McCarthy delegates are 
Richard Belford, former chairman of the 
New Haven Commission on Equal Oppor-
tunities and the Reverend Robert Fors-
berg, leader of a church coalition known 
as the W~der City Parish. 

Support has also come from former 
members of the city's Democratic organi-
zation who don't feel comfortable about 
either the local or the national party situ-
ation. A delegate on the McCarthy slate, 
Ann Mitchell, was formerly Democratic 
party chairlady for the city's 21st ward. 

Nevertheless, most of the politically 
oriented social action groups in the city of 
New Haven have not seen the McCarthy 
campaign as the place to fight the good 
fight against city hall and the party. Over-
tures to these groups from the under-
financed and somewhat disorganized Mc-
Carthy Democrats have drawn outright 
rejections as well as offers for covert help 
and canvassing assistance with caveats 
that no mention of the names of the 
organizations be made. 

Some black groups in the city have re-
strained from entering the McCarthy fight 
either because of their funding depend-
ency on Community Progress, Inc., or 
because they are busy pursuing the fragile 
illusion of a statewide bloc of black 
voters. 

If the majority of more than 20,000 
registered Democrats in this city find a 
focus for their discontent in the promise 
McCarthy and the local McCarthy cam-
paigners offer, the fight can be won. To

**Title: Steel**
**Author: Fred Hyde**

Steel 
One of the men Lyndon Johnson drafted 
to mediate the Dominican Republic crisis 
in 1965 was Ellsworth Bunker, now our 
ambassador to Vietnam. Bunker is the 
sort of Yale-spawned public servant who 
responds to duty, pragmatically analyzes a 
situation and shoulders his responsibility 
without so much as a groan. In this case, 
Bunker also happened to be a director of 
a company that is one of the largest owners 
of sugar lallVs in the Dominican Republic. 

It's such curious coincidences as this, 
barely audible now next to the guns of 
Vietnam, that make one start to ask if 
Vietnam is really such a fluke, and that at 
the same time bring into focus a number 
of questions about American foreign 
policy. How much does the US confuse 
the interests of American corporations 
with the national interest? What are the 
limits of American intervention? Are all 
areas of the world equally crucial to the 
national security? 

One individual actively asking these 
questions is Ronald Steel, who was at Yale 
for a week in February as a visiting fellow 
in Jonathan Edwards College. Steel is 
almost unique in occupation. He is a 
political writer whose perceptive and fresh 
insights into foreign policy have gained 
increased attention. Yet Steel belongs to 
no university, institute, magazine, govern-
ment agency or politician's brood. He's 
freelance and self-supporting. 

Steel, who graduated from North-
western and holds a master's degree in 
political economy from Harvard, spent 
a year in the foreign service before de-
ciding that bureaucracy was not for him. 
He left his assignment in Cyprus for New 
York, where the only writing job he could 
find was with a high school current 
affairs magazine. While with that maga-
zine, he wrote a book review which 
was accepted by The New Republic. 

He began writing freelance full time, 
with his articles appearing in a wide 
variety of periodicals. Some of the best 
have recently appeared in The New York 
Review of Books, and he will soon be 
writing a series of articles for The New 
American Review. Steel also spent a year 
as a Congressional fellow of the American 
Political Science Association, including 
a six-month stint with Senator Fulbright. 

Steel's first book, End of Alliance, dem-
onstrates the obsolescence of the NATO 
alliance and the archaic thinking behind 
the idea of an "Atlantic community." Pax 
Americana, which appeared last year, 
deals with the broader problems of Amer-
ica's role as a global power. These prob-
lems were also at the center of the seminars 
Steel led in Jonathan Edwards. 

"America's foreign policy," Steel said 
in an interview while at Yale, "has become 
self-defeating. It's hung up on its own 
ideology of anti-communism, and bas led 
us into involvements not necessary for our 
own security or national interests or even 
for the benefit of the people we're trying 
to help. 

"This counter-ideology of anti-com-
munism has also made for an evasion of 
the real problems of American society. 
People aren't free in this country. We ex-
ternalize our own problems and are now 
beginning to pay the price." 

Steel said that American intervention-
ism has been based on premises that 
seemed reasonable two decades ago 
(although the factual basis of those 
premises is increasingly open to debate). 
"But certainly," he added, "they're no 
longer valid today. And our foreign policy 
today is conducted by people whose atti-
tudes were formed in the late 1940's and 
who haven't changed." 

Some who agree with most of Steel's 
observations would change his emphasis 
on an ideology of anti-communism and 
instead point to an American preoccupa-
tion with stability and the status quo and 
a corresponding uncertainty when results 
are not predictable. 

One example that bolsters Steel's con-
tions, however, is the US reaction to 
Cuba. Steel was in Cuba in January, as a 
journalist covering the Cultural Congress. 
"I went not knowing what to expect," 
said Steel. "I had some sympathy with the 
aims of the Revolution, but I probably 
expected to find a revolution betrayed, a 
party apparatus imposed on a society, with 
Soviet imperialism substituted for Amer-
ican imperialism-that it would be like 
Eastern Europe, but with a sunny climate. 

"It was quite different. There was a 
tremendous excitement and idealism that 
reminded me of the kibbutz mentality of 
Israel. The common danger was a cohe.'live 
element. Much was phrased in the tra-
ditiOnal Marxist rhetoric, but that didn't 
make it any less passionate or convincing. 
People seemed to actively like the gov-
ernment. This is true of the young people, 
I must add. Anybody over 35 finds it very 
difficult to adjust to life in Cuba today."
