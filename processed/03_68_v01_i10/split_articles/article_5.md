Hair stylist (for men) 
Gentlemen's Workshop 
Do you get your hair cut with the same attitude 
that you cut your fingernails? Instead of just a 
"haircut," why not have your hair styled next time? 
A hairstylist considers your face as a whole. He can 
do more to improve your appearance than your tailor. 
Try it, unless you are perfect now.
