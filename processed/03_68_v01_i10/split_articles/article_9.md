To the Editors: 

The road to nation-building is not smooth 
for a country like Nigeria. With 56 million 
people in an area about the size of Texas 
and Okll}homa, Nigeria has within its 
boundaries 250 or more ethnic groups 
speaking different languages. Yet never 
before in the history of modern Africa 
have so many people been ruled by so few 
whom they themselves elected. 

Political parties in Nigeria grew along 
ethnic and regional lines, mostly to protect 
each group's or region's interest- and so 
contributed to suspicion among ethnic 
groups. Each party is held together by 
traditional, familial, ethnic and religious 
loyalties. The l bos, the most educated and 
vocal group in pre-independent Nigeria, 
came to dominate the NCNC (National 
Council of Nigerian Convention), which 
became merely the mouthpiece of an 
lbo ethnic and cultural or&anization, the 
lbo Union.
