Lesson No. I in 
Practical Economics 
for diamond-minded 
students 
Most of the reason for the 
retail price of a diamond is 
the fact that this is the cus-
tomary procedure: jewelers 
buy from wholesalers. They 
pay high rentals for their 
stores. They own fancy 
fixtures. They have higher 
priced help than most other 
retailers. They pay a lot for 
insurance. They have an 
inventory-obsolescence 
problem. They spend a lot 
for advertising, accounting 
and other business ex-
penses. They need and de-
serve a high mark-up. They 
couldn't exist without it. 
But take us .We buy 
where the wholesaler buys. 
That can save up to% to 
begin w ith. No inventory. 
We sell from a catalogue oÂ£ 
natural color photos. No 
overhead because we have 
no fancy store. No capital 
investment. No obsoles-
cence. No insurance. Noth-
ing but top quality at 
bottom prices.
