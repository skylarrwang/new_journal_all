AI LaValley in jail: II All the 
routines you live by drop away 
very suddenly~ and the time 
really stops. There was no 
time. People ask~ did it go by 
slowly 
I did it go by fast. It just 
did not exist.~~ 

Over two thousand people participated in demonstra-
tions outside the Army Induction Center in Oakland, 
california, on December 18 and 19, 1967. The police, 
apparently having learned to do without rough tactics 
after the bloody demonstrations in October ("letter 
from Berkeley," The New Journal, October 29, 1967), 
were efficient and even anxious to avoid violence. 
Almost 300 people were arrested during the two days 
of demonstrations. 

Among those arrested on the first day was Albert 
LaValley, who had not been particularly politically 
ICtive during his ten years at Yale as a graduate 
ltudent and as an English teacher. last fall LaValley, 
whose book Carlyle and the Idea of the Moderns has 
)lilt been published by the Yale Press, went to teach 
at San Francisco State College. The following inter-
view Is the story of LaValley's experiences in the 
Ill-in and during his subsequent jail term. The story 
exists within the larger context of the discovery of an 
environment very different from the one LaValley had 
known at Yale. The interview was conducted over 
long-distance telephone In mid-January by Susan 
Braudy and Daniel Yergln. 

How did you first get Involved? 

How did I come to sit in at the Oakland Induction 
Center? This is difficult to trace. The first step here 
this winter was turning in my draft card. I turned in my 
draft card in early December. 

I read a letter to my class that I wrote to my draft 
board in which I expressed my feelings about the 
frustrations young people were facing. I wrote that 
nobody was paying attention to these things. 1 thought 
the government was alienating people who would be 
leaders tomorrow. And I said to the class that I was 
thinking about my own protest, about going fo jail, 
and some of them said, "Why don't you?" I pondered 
it for a while and then decided that I would go. 

I knew what the Oakland demonstration was-
there were signs up for that-but I didn't know 
anybody working on it. I then decided that I would 
have to go to some meetings. I wanted to find out what 
jail was like and how violent this thing was going to 
be. And I went down to--it was like going under-
ground-to this very, very sinister street, to a 
converted warehouse, where some people who had 
been in jail in October were having a meeting. We sat 
on the floor in a very pot-like atmosphere. These 
people struck me as much less shrill than the people 
up at State. They were rather ironic, and it was the 
first irony that I had seen out here. They had a sense 
of humor, and they seemed realistic. Yet they seemed 
committed to things. So I knew that I was with 
good people. 

There were all these older people, from all walks of 
life, which came as a surprise, and this was true in 
jail too. We had a vineyard owner from Modesta, a 
Quaker, who's been committed to these causes for a 
long while. We had several educators. We had a 
pacifist from the Forties, who runs the Walden School 
in Berkeley. We had a longshoreman-an M.A. from 
Stanford, but still a longshoreman. And we had two 
Unitarian ministers. 

At this tactics meeting in the warehouse run by the 
War Resistance League, we were learning purely 
non-violent tactics. At the meeting I realized that 
there are threats to face. Sometimes Hell's Angels 
motorcycle gangs come to muddy things up. In fact, 
the Angels did appear at a Be-In on Sunday before 
the Oakland demonstration. They beat several people 
up, and the police didn't Interfere. 

What did they teach you at the non-violence school? 

First we play-acted picketers and active hecklers, 
and this can be very real. I was surprised. My Eastern 
irony says that this kind of thing does not work-we 
are play-acting. But it does work, it did work. Old 
people got tackled, knocked down and kicked by 
young people. In fact, we all took our turns at 
getting knocked down and kicked. 

So after this practice morning se .. ion, 
waa Oakland next? 

Monday morning, the 18th of December, about six 
o'clock in the morning. There at the Oakland 
Induction Center, a large support group was walking 
around on the streets. I think nearly three hundred 
people were eventually arrested for civil disobedience 
and for not having their draft cards. 

I was in the first group arrested. I simply sat in a 
doorway at the Induction Center. It was a very strange 
feeling. It was raining, everything was wet. It was 
about six in the morning, and there I was sitting 
in a doorway. 

Did you walk up to the Induction Center by yourseH 
or in a group? 

People just gathered around there. It was extraor-
dinary to see how many people drove up from various 
places all alone, and, even in this public place, had 
a private sense of using this kind of protest for a 
private educational experience. Really remarkable. 
Many had not been very active in war resistance. At 
Yale they would be isolated people, I think. Here 
they have started doing things. That morning around 
the Induction Center, some were picketing. Those 
who were going to commit civil disobedience were 
asked to come over in front of the Center. 

You just sort of found yourself a place. I wanted to 
get it over with. So I simply sat in this doorway; then 
more people came to sit there, too. With about ten 
of us in the doorway, it got crowded. It got tense. They 
put up large boards inside the door. I didn't know 
whether they wanted to force the door open and push 
us out of the doorway, or whether they were simply 
protecting their door. Then several people who 
worked at the Induction Center came. They insisted 
on going to work. And they did trample over us. 

A girl on crutches was there with us. This made 
things a little difficult. Then a .group of inductees 
who were really up-tight arrived. We tried talking to 
them, but it didn't seem to work. One of them kept 
screaming, " There's psychiatric help for you people." 

Then a Marine came up. I don't know what his 
function was, but he looked very magnificent in his 
uniform. He was breathing very tensely. 

I was a little bewildered by the whole thing. As I 
was sitting there, a few of my students came by and 
shook my hand. It was very strange. Everybody said I 
looked rather innocent. I was just waiting for it to 
get over. And I was afraid something violent 
might happen. 

Then it happened. Just like on television. A man 
came up and said that he was the manager of the 
building, and that we had to move on or we would be 
arrested. And then the police came and did their 
little act with the bullhorn and took pictures and 
hauled us off. A few people did resist arrest. They 
went limp. 

And then came the Oakland jail? 

The police station, the courthouse and the jail are all 
part of one complex at Oakland. The first thing that 
hit me was the inhumanity of the process. It startles 
anybody who's arrested. The deeper I went into the 
experience, the more inhumane and sadistic people 
seemed, and the more contained by the system they 
were in. I had been at an English Department party 
at San Francisco State the night before, and that first 
day at Oakland I was very tired. They took us into a 
large room at the jail. They fingerprinted us five times. 
Our pictures were taken three times. Booking is 
pure bureaucracy, and here too the arbitrariness 
seemed evident. Some people had almost all their 
clothes taken away. I guess they had sympathy for 
me because of my back brace. They left not only my 
sweater, but my coat. I was the only person with a 
coat. I gave it to somebody else who was freezing. 

Then began two weird days without even a glimpse 
of daylight. There was some electric light, but we 
were in these dim, Kafkaesque yellow rooms. They all 
looked alike, and we w~re herded from one to 
another. The first day they took us to a room with a 
hundred beds, and I talked to a lot of people. Already 
you could see civilization springing up there. People 
were introducing themselves, making up games and 
welcoming new arrivals. Most people, we found out, 
had been arrested not for sitting in the doorway, 
but for sitting in lines in front of the buses carrying 
the inductees. 

The second day in jail at Oakland was more mind-
boggling. We could have gotten out on bail, of course, 
but we decided against it. And what stunned me 
again that day was the total inhumanity of the process. 
I hadn't eÂ¥pected it to be this bad. They keep herding 
you from room to room, very small rooms. You don't 
know where you're going. lee Bond, a very level-
headed fellow from San Francisco State, began 
feeling Ill. So we told the guards, who said they would 
give him attention. But all they did was take him and 
throw him in another cell all alone. And they left him 
there. This was the first example of their punitive way 
of dealing with illnesses that continued much more 
disastrously later in the jail at Santa Rita. Their 
reasoning: If you're going to get sick, you don't get 
arrested, you don't go to jail. At one point they said, 
"Let the bastards die." 

The problem of crowding was less serious, but still 
striking. On the second day, for instance, they took 
twenty-five of us-no, fifty of us-into a tiny room, 
the anteroom to the courtroom, a really foul place. It

had only one toilet, and crap smeared all over the 
place, peeling walls, and things written all over it. 
Everybody had bad headaches from being herded 
from one of these close rooms to another all day long. 

This Is the Oakland City Jail? 

Yes, but then right outside where we were was this 
plush courtroom with great wood panels on the other 
side of the door. The judge was elected but everybody 
knew he was a Reagan man, and we kept hearing that 
the sentences were going to be very stiff. He wanted 
to give us a year's probation and fifteen days, but 
the lawyers had indicated that they were not going to 
take that. The judge was angry. He was determined 
to punish us. He sentenced people in groups of ten 
or twelve. He read the charges: we had tumultuously 
and offensively gathered and refused to disperse and 
things like that. There were several charges, and 
many of them were dropped. Finally, we were all 
sentenced for disturbing the peace. The judge gave 
twenty-day sentences to first offenders and forty-five 
days to those who were committing civil disobedience 
a second time. 

I was with Lee Bond on the bus that took us to the 
Santa Rita jail. You are put into a bus where each 
seat runs across the bus, and there are several 
paneled areas that you are locked into. I was locked 
into an area with this guy Lee, and he was in such 
pain that he could hardly move. 

When we got to Santa Rita, we made a point to 
get medical help for Lee. They finally took him into 
the Oakland Hospital, where he saw a doctor. He saw 
four doctors later at various times, none of whom did 
much of anything. Later he needed hospitalization, 
and we went on strike for him, but I will come to that. 
But they did try to take care of him. 

Santa Rita is south of the Livermore Valley, and 
it is called the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center. 

lslt a prison farm? 

No, it is the county jail. It is not a real prison, but 
a minimum security prison, with fences all around 
it. Actually, it is an old Navy Base. 

At Santa Rita, they stripped us of everything. What 
had not been taken at Oakland was taken there. Then 
we were sprayed with DDT, which is a little painful. 
They give you a pair of dungarees that don't fit 
you. You are allowed to keep your shoes and socks, 
after they have searched them. They give you a blue 
shirt, and that's it. No reading material. You have to 
keep washing your underwear, and during the twenty 
days almost everybody's underwear was worn out. 
Stockings completely disintegrate if you wear them 
for twenty days in a row. When we lett, we willed 
whatever underwear was still intact to the people 
who were still there. The first bit of brutality we felt-
1 don't know if it was really brutality-we were 
awakened the next morning about 4:30 for breakfast. 
The temperature was about 30 degrees. Most of the 
time the weather was very warm, but that first day 
was cold. There was heavy frost. Then we were 
dragged outside and made to wait in line for fifteen 
minutes before we went to breakfast. And this was 
the beginning of the general harassment. 

If they woke you at 4:30, what time was breakfast? 

We were normally served breakfast at 5:30. We were 
scheduled for only two meals a day after our rebellion, 
so I ought to talk about the rebellion. The first night 
we were told we were going to be integrated with 
the other prisoners. If we shaved and showered, that 
is. But many people did not want to shave. Some 
people had beards for religious reasons, and others 
had beards because they played in rock-and-roll 
bands. And others felt a kind of castration in having 
these crewcut people coming at your beards and 
moustaches with clippers. 

They wanted you to get your hair cut too? 

You had to have your hair cut and a shave. You 
would be allowed a thin moustache, but you had to 
have your hair cut. An older man from the non-
violence tactics school felt that our main issue was the 
War. He had a beard for twenty years and he did not 
seem to think that it was a major issue. But the young 
people really did think it was an issue. And most of the 
older people decided the first night at Santa Rita to 
support the young people and not have a shave 
and haircut. 

And the next morning it happened-quite impromp-
tu. They came in and asked how many wanted to be 
integrated and get privileges. But those who don't, 
they said, can take your blankets and clothing to the 
other barracks. And that's what we did. Everybody 
just got up and did it. Then they herded us into an 
area with five barracks around a courtyard; we were 
segregated from the regular prisoners. We were put 
into two adjoining barracks, separated by a gate. 
They closed the gate after three days, when they saw 
that we were having meetings and getting a little too 
organized. 

The barracks I was in did not open into the court-
yard. So when we opened our doors, we were just on 
a sidewalk that ran about a hundred feet-the length 
of the barracks. So it was 50 or 60 people in a room 
about 100 feet long. The room had nothing in it but 
double bunk beds, five cold-water spigots, three 
johns and a urinal. That was it. We could open the 
doors and go out to the sidewalks in the front, but 
no farther. The johns were the same as they are in all 
prisons, out in the open. The bathroom itself was not 
even closed off. You know, it was almost part of 
the main room. 

Were the barracks heated? 

They were supposed to be heated. Some of them 
were, but ours wasn't. But after a while the weather 
got warmer. Though some people still got colds. It 
was cold at night, of course. It was always cold and 
uncomfortable to sleep there. We told the lieutenant 
about our colds when he came to talk to us at one 
point. He said colds are not a new thing, they are not 
an old thing either, they are there, they are every-
where people gather. Soon we sounded like a 
tuberculosis ward. I was very lucky. I had a cold two 
days and then it went away. We were fortunate to be 
in our barracks, because we finally began getting 
sunshine all day, and we sat outside in the sun. 

The women were taken elsewhere? 

Oh, yes. We saw them for the last time on the paddy 
wagon trip from the Induction Center at Oakland. 

But you heard about Joan Baez and her being 
put Into the Hole (solitary confinement)? 

In prison there is a grapevine, you see. Everything 
travels. When we went on a hunger strike for Lee 
Bond to get some medical treatment, the women 
went on a sympathy strike the next meal. They knew 
by that time. The captain came on the second day of 
our strike, and Lee was still very sick, and our Stan-
ford pathologist said he needed to be hospitalized. I 
told the captain at this point about him, and the 
captain said that he would be given medical treat-
ment. I was interested in my own attitude. 1 was willing 
to admit that the captain was a rational man. He 
seemed rational. I believed he would bring medical 
treatment. But the next day no medical treatment 
came. This fellow Lee could not get up to go to the 
dining hall, where we went twice a day. Our group 
was segregated from the other prisoners. We had 
only two meals a day, one at 5:30 in the morning, the 
other at three in the afternoon. We were allowed no 
privileges, no visitors, no mail, ingoing or outgoing. 
We did not have jackets for ten days. We didn't even 
have any toothpaste for five days or toothbrushes tor 
six. You cannot believe what the first taste of tooth-
paste is like after six days. It's the most exquisite 
flavor. 

I had believed that the captain would get help tor 
Lee, but he did not get help, and he lied to us in 
other instances. It was clear that the man was a liar, 
but I was not willing to admit this. I had always 
assumed that Jaw has some justice in it, but I quicklY

learned that it does not. It is quite arbitrary. Their 
punitive techniques were simply haphazard. Every-
thing went according to whim. It was just like 
Catch-22. We actually had a copy of Catch-22 in the 
barracks. I split in into two parts, and it was widely 
circulated. It was a great favorite. Many felt it was the 
greatest book ever written, but that could be because 
they read it in jail, which is Catch-22 all over. The 
people in charge say something is the rule, but the 
rule is incomprehensible and you can't question it. 

The girls were also in trouble for failing to obey 
some rule which they did not understand. They later 
went on strike, which brought them a bread-and-
water diet for three days. Joan Baez was put in the 
Hole because she was the spokesman who went up 
to ask what rule they had violated. 

When the captain came a second time, he came to 
quiet us, because he thought we might become a 
problem like the girls. I was interested to see if there 
was a unanimity of response to him. Everybody knew 
that this man was a fool. I began to detect a 
mechanical smile that I had not seen the first time. 
Whenever we asked a question, he said, "I came to 
tell, not to discuss." There was finally a violent debate 
about what to do to get medical treatment for Lee. 
He had not been allowed to eat for two days because 
he could not walk to the dining hall, and we would 
get busted and sent to solitary if we brought food 
back. He was in great pain. 

At breakfast the next morning everybody took an 
empty tray and sat down. There were a few other 
prisoners, non-cooperative sorts, who saw us, and it 
reached them immediately. They cheered us when-
ever we entered the dining hall after that, and they 
would always flash a V-sign to us. As we lett the 
dining room that morning, we sang "We Shall 
Overcome." It was really a moving kind of experience, 
and by nine there was medical help. 

Ironically, 1 don't think the medical help had any-
thing to do with our strike, but the strike had other 
900d effects. It helped bind us together. It also gave 
the other prisoners the sense that things coul? .be 
done to make Santa Rita a better place. I see 1a11 as a 
kind of rug under which all our American problems are 
hidden. Prisoners are mainly winos and narcotics 
cases, and probably about eighty per cent Negroes. 
Eighty-three per cent come back to prison. No re-
habilitation goes on there, obviously. It is a place 
Where society conceals problems. You learn to look 
at America in a completely different way; you see that 
jail is just an incarnation of all the worst things in 
this country. The people who run it are violent a.n.d 
&adistic-the struggling little men, mostly ex-m1htary, 
Who need power. 

. 

The captain is obviously a parody of authonty 
figures who roam through our society, those mechan-
Ical people who claim they're only doing their job. 
He appeals to regulations and rules, and the world 
becomes kind of crazy because there are endle~ 
rules, and it you ask a questi~::m, sudd.enly ~rule IS 
Invented to take care of it. It 1s very dtsturbtng to see 
this; it can alter your vision of America. People in 
1hia country have cut themselves off from a sense of 
responsibility. They have gotten into their own bag, 
into their suburban home, and they don't care. They 
don't see the horror that goes on. They can say that 
this is the greatest country in the world, and at the 
next moment condemn the War in an abstract way. 

But then it's really interesting to see how we 
learned to live so well together under these intimate 
conditions. We had nothing at all. Our books were 
taken away from us, aside from a few that had been 
smuggled in or had been lying around. The intensity of 
learning to live with these people made all other 
things seem trivial, made the prison seem trivial. And 
it made even outside seem trivial after a while. When 
I came out that last Saturday, I expected the real 
world to be more real, to be beautiful and tangible. 
But when I came out, everything was shadowy and 
fictive. The real world was back there with those 
people. We were obviously intensely relating to each 
other while we were there. 

How do you mean? 

Well, I was struck both at Santa Rita and in the 
Oakland jail by how civilization suddenly seems to 
begin again when you do not have things. We made 
balls out of blankets, yarn and adhesive tape that a 
trusty smuggled to us. In fact, he was very good at 
getting us things from the outside. He brought 
cigarettes every evening. The trusty was our liaison 
with the world outside and with the other prisoners, 
some of our fellows, who had taken the shave and 
haircut and gone out and worked. One guy from 
Santa Cruz worked on a pig farm. Another guy 
worked in a bakery. The Stanford pathologist ended 
up pouring water in the dining hall. 

The guards would harass those who stayed behind. 
One of their techniques was to take someone off to 
solitary, quite arbitrarily, for some offense that you 
could never understand, and keep him there for five 
days. Some people were in maximum security for 
the time, where all you got was a mattress and a 
simple blanket in the evening from 11 to 6. The rest of 
the day you had to stand in a seven by seven cell, 
shared with cockroaches and ants. 

About the twelfth day, a guard we called Piggy, who 
was new on the job, came to harass us. He herded all 
60 of us into the little john area and made us walk by 
it again and again. Afterwards we sang Mickey Mouse 
songs because we were so frustrated and offended 
by the whole thing. Then he hauled one guy off. We 
were so stunned that we did not protest. When he 
came back that night and tried to take someone else 
off, we just all walked outside. We are all going, we 
said. And with that he had to get the lieutenant who 
came down and apologized and said that the man 
was new. Toward the end it was very beautiful to 
watch this punitive system break down. After that 
many people wanted to go greystone, solitary. 

They wanted to see what it was like. They also 
wanted to subvert the system. 

Piggy came in once and pleaded with us to rescue 
two people outside on the sidewalk who refused to 
come in for the count. He said to us, " Is there anybody 
here in authority who can persuade these two people 
to come in?" One black fellow, who is going to be a 
fine leader someday, answered, "I am the only black 
man here, therefore I have the power." 

What else happened among people in your barracks 
group? 

My own feelings about the group are the interesting 
part of the experience. Actually this intense group 
thing might happen under any situation of 
psychological stress. It does not have to happen in 
prison. But because it was prison, it made some 
difference. And it opened me up to many new things. 
At first I was perfectly friendly with people, but 1 
was the only person in his thirties in this barracks, 
though several people were older. I was also the 
only regular college teacher. And I had been 
resisting the California environment. 

That first day in Santa Rita, I met two extremely 
intelligent people talking about astrology. 1 never 
had any great interest in astrology, and I don't 
expect to develop one. But here were guys of 
extraordinary intelligence working out astrology 
charts for people. Suddenly I realized I knew a little 
astrology; I read Yeats, for instance. All right, so it 
still sounded zany to me. But I listened. I learned 
something too. Meanwhile somebody else was doing 
yoga. We soon started holding yoga classes, which 
I joined to get rid of my nervousness. I was nervous 
as hell that first day. I did yoga simply as a physical 
tool, not for any kind of theoretical belief at all. 
But it did relieve my nerves. 

At first I felt distant from these life styles. They 
struck me as strange, remote and sometimes 
ridiculous. Then I moved to an acceptance of diversity 
and new things which I had really believed I could 
not tolerate. In the process I learned how stuffy and 
rigid I was. My conservatism was constantly being 
brought home to me on the matter of colleges and 
universities. Thi~ always came up as my topic in 
discussions because I was part of the institution 
that many considered evil and actually doomed. Out 
here all kinds of free universities are beginning. 
They are a partial answer to people's community 
needs, because the established universities have 
become so big and bureaucratic. Yale seems 
incredibly human by comparison with these things 
out here. Free universities do develop as alternative 
communities. They stress group therapy types of 
programs and the exotic, but always with a kind of 
personal bent. I have looked very, very suspiciously 
at these things, but I talked to people at Santa Rita 
and elsewhere who made incredible sense about 
them. People talked about the kind of education 
that could be based on each person's needs-
education that does not try to channel anything or to 
place anything on top of people. 

In jail, these kinds of educational situations 
would spring up. Little by little seminars did develop, 
though they were hardly ever scheduled. We had 
seminars on Martin Suber. We had seminars on the 
future of the resistance movement, on the draft 
laws, on literature. You name it, there was a seminar. 
We had humanistic psychology lectures, and lectures 
on the longshoremen's union. 

Why can't we all conduct education in a more 
leisurely manner like this, with courses less rigid, 
less structured? I liked the fact that you could go to 
the classes you wanted. This is education to meet 
your interests and needs. 

Did the time pau slowly? 

At Santa Rita jail, anyway, the atmosphere of The 
Magic Mountain was always running through my 
mind. There was an incredible sense of severance 
from the familiar. All the routines you live by drop 
away very suddenly, and time really stops. There was 
no time. People ask, did it go by slowly, did it go 
by fast. It just did not exist. Several people said the 
whole experience resembled a very long acid trip. 
Time really stopped because there wasn't anything 
to measure it by. There were just our meals, and 
sometimes it got dark, and sometimes it was light. 
The effect of this on me was very peculiar. First of all,
