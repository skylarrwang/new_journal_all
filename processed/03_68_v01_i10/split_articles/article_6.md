Summer violence: 
black and white 
by Austin Clarke 
Born in Barbados and educat.ed at the 
University of Toronto, Austin Clarke is a 
producer for the Canadian Broadcasting 
Company and the editor of Ebo Voices. 
The author of three novels, the latest 
entitled The Meeting Point, Mr. Clarke 
was recently a visiting fellow at Berkeley, 
Calhoun, and Morse Colleges. 
Certain misconceptions drift around this 
Yale campus like the woof in the long 
hair of the various cultists. These miscon-
ceptions, on a superficial examination, 
have to do with the relationship of the 
black student to the white student; and 
on a larger scale, with the relationship of 
the two races in the larger society of which 
Yale is, ironically, a very unreal sample. 
But in the deeper realities of racism in this 
country, these misconceptions become 
hypocrisy and racial deceitfulness--
perhaps cultural deceit, which is about 
the most heinous crime a man can ration-
alize himself into committing, by the 
process called intellectualism. 

It is now obvious even to those who are 
gripped in this cultural deceit that Amer-
ica is in a state of tension, trembling like 
a bowl of psychotic jello. It has put itself 
into this position of nervous trembling 
tension, in the first place, through this de-
ceit. But this deceit has a certain historical 
basis. The relevant fact is, that the white 
man is concerned about violence this 
summer. In blunt terms, he is concerned 
about the possibility of his being killed in 
what Esquire magazine, very emotionally, 
called The Second Civil War. The black 
man, on the other hand, is more correctly, 
deeply concerned. His concern is for his 
life, whether or not he is something called, 
by the inventiveness of journalism, a Black 
Nationalist, a Black Racist, or a Black 
Muslim; and his concern at this time of 
tension is based on no more startling an 
historical fact than that, even in times of 
less expressed tension, his life, his creative 
ambition in terms of achievement within 
the greater society, has always been domi-
nated by the possibility of his being killed 
by whites, simply because he is black. 

I do not think, however, that the con-
cern of the white man in this context is 
anything more than an awareness. His con-
cern cannot be, and is not, from his own 
historical relationships with black people, 
of a nature that can be translated into any 
creative action to avert this impending 
violence-violence both to himself and to 
the black man. I think that the white man 
today in this country, because of his stance 
of silent immorality, has been put in a 
position of interpreting this concern (if 
he has thought about it at all in these 
terms) to mean his concern for white lives. 
And also, his concern for white property. 
He will arm himself against blacks; 
blacks in general, blacks whose very pres-
ence and existence, he is convinced, 
threaten him and are even bent upon the 
destruction of him as a man. This white 
choice, this arming against the Second 
Civil War, has in effect stated that the 
possibility of understanding, of communi-
cation between the two races, of facing 
the reality that this arming is no solution, 
is really the signal that the black man must 
once again clothe himself in his historical 
shell of defensiveness. 

One gets the impression that the two 
forces in the society, the civil and the pri-
vate attitudes to arming and therefore to 
violence, must react one upon the other in 
such a way as-to create a chain reaction 
of indiscriminate slaughter of blacks and 
whites. And the sad possibility exists that 
when white citizens arm themselves, their 
act presupposes a certain incapability on 
the part of the Jaw agencies to do the job of 
killing the identified enemy cleanly and 
efficiently. The terrible implication exists 
that the white citizens have private scores 
to settle which may not arise out of the 
declared state of rebellion or revolution or 
riot. There is a very real possibility that 
this private arming might result in a mad 
thirst for black blood, the racial implica-
tion of the term notwithstanding. 

The concern of the black man is a real 
one. He has found himself in a position 
that may be called revolutionary, revo-
lutionary not so much in a political sense 
as in a cultural sense. His historical tra-
dition in this country has taught him that 
the white man could conceivably choose 
one of his race for lynching, for murder, 
for rape; the society has reacted against 
him in such a way as to rob him of all his 
freedoms, or of a considerable and signi-
ficant amount of the freedoms that exist by 
the simple fact of birth. Today, this black 
man is in a position in which he sees that 
the society has in fact, through its acts, 
chosen his entire race, or a considerable 
portion of it, tot elimination. Police forces 
have bought equipment which tradition-
ally one expects to find only on the battle-
field of an enemy of the United States, 
not in a black community. The publica-
tion, whether intended or not, of descrip-
tions of the arsenals located strategically 
throughout the country, the hardened 
attitude of white egotism and the very 
existence of these arsenals states that the 
justification of their use almost coincides 
with the apparent sanguinity of their 
purpose. This is the revolutionary position 
confronting the black man in this country. 

You get the terrifying feeling in the guts 
that every white man you meet on the 
street is praying for the summer to come, 
like Americans wish for Christmas and 
Santa Claus. You get the uneasy premoni-
tion that something has been planned: 
wait until summer, this Negro problem will 
be solved once and for all. But although 
this is the wrong medicine for an ailment 
which was wrongly diagnosed to begin 
with, no one seems too worried about it. 
It has gone beyond that. 

I have not yet considered the causes 
for this intensified white attitude reflected 
in civic and private arming. They are 
simple: the attitude arose out of the vari-
ous white reactions to the rebellions, to 
"crime in our streets," to "lawlessness," 
to "civil violence," which are really 
euphemisms for "niggers acting up and 
getting out of hand." But these rebellions 
were caused by something else: something 
cultural, something historical, something 
that exists in the very foundations of this 
society. The arming and its motivation 
state bluntly that the causes of those re-
bellions (not only of last summer but the 
perennial question of what to do with the 
niggers in the woodpile of society) have 
now become irreconcilable, absolutely 
insoluble. They state bluntly that the pos-
sibility of any creative relationship be-
tween blacks and whites is not only non-
existent, but undesirable; and in this way, 
the act of arming and the apparent desira-
bility of implementing the usefulness of 
those arms shows that white America is 
reverting back to the psychology of the 
strong cowboy of the legendary West. 
Bang! Bang! Bang! Problem solved. You 
blow the morality away in the smoke of 
the gun and the guilt and the conscience 
disappear with the smoke. 

It should be evident by now that I have 
laid most, if not all, of the liability upon 
the white American. This is not necessarily 
a racist point of view. It is more the point 
of view derived from a realistic appraisal 
of the real power of this white American 
-a power which is undeniably great 
enough to end effective racism, a power 
which by its execution in racial considera-
tions ignores morality and conscience. But 
this acknowledgment of the white man's 
power does not imply that the moral 
aspect of racism, though its end might be 
achievable, would disappear with the 
actual, physical end of racism. And this 
would be my refutation of the opinion of 
Dick Gregory, the comedian, who told a 
Yale audience recently that while he was 
disposed to call America the most racist 
country in the world, this definition did not 
exclude the black American. This opinion 
of Mr. Gregorys undoubtedly shows a 
comedian's predisposition for making 
people laugh, if at the expense of keeping 
them instructed. For if Mr. Gregory were 
concerned more with instruction than with 
comedy, then he would have understood 
that historically the power to do good and 
the power to do evil, like the corresponding 
freedom to be good and to be evil, has 
always been in the hands of the white 
man; and this power bas been used. 

To substantiate this position, let me go 
back to what can be seen in the white pri-
vate assumption of arms. It is egotism. 
It is self-protectionism. It is alienation. It 
also is a statement that those agencies 
elected to provide protection for the citi-
zen (black and white) within the law have 
broken down or are assumed to have 
broken down, that those agencies are too 
impartial (depending upon one's degree of 
racist attitude) to the black citizens. The 
white citizen with arms ceases to regard 
the black citizen as a citizen at all, or as a 
human being, and regards him more as a 
threatening force outside of himself. As a 
statistic. As a minority, defined only by 
reports of commissions. Some social psy-
chologists have defined this society as a 
song-singing society. I think it is a 
commission-oriented society. 

One gets the feeling also that this white 
arming is to serve not only the preserva-
tion of white lives but also the main-
tenance ,of white property. Recognizing 
the sovereignty imputed to property by the 
white man, and recognizing the white 
man's refusal to acknowledge his associa-
tive humanity to blacks (both innocent and 
guilty in a riot-violence context) when 
they are locked in a so-called riot-this 
recognition clearly exposes the sliding 
scale of cultural and moral values, the 
schizophrenic, in American civilization. 

But the white man cannot stop at arm-
ing himself and then wait behind the 
darkened blinds of his conscience for the 
black revolutionary or the black rioter 
to show his face of anger and dissent. 
Similarly, the white man cannot justi-
fiably correlate his inaction, his non-
participation in killing blacks, or his lib-
eralism with his financial contribution 
to so-called civil rights movements and 
organizations or his physical participation 
in them. In the present context of revo-
lution, the white man cannot sit down 
in front of his television set, view the 
violence and conclude that he is morally 
righteous and racialistically better than the 
killing cop, merely because of this physi-
cal non-participation. He cannot in any 
way achieve this moral absolution, even if 
in the process of witnessing the "de-
tached" television violence he does shed 
a few tears. It is beyond tears and moral 
values. For him to rationalize this way is 
to pretend he can live outside the reality of 
his social responsibility, which has now 
become a responsibility because of factors 
that are out of his control. 

Basically, this action of non-action 
cannot be a realistic tactic, because in this 
context of violence in the revolution, the 
definitions of white liberal, white activist, 
white racist, white cop, on the one hand, 
and black nationalist, Negro, nigger, Black 
Muslim, Uncle Tom, on the other, will 
cease to have value, will cease to have 
relevance. The values which both racial 
groups think they can derive from the 
violence, from the threat of violence and 
from the communication or political re-
lationship erupting out of the conclusion 
of the violence-these values are going 
to be the real values. Nobody should be 
too concerned, in this context, if he is to be 
killed, although he does not subscribe to 
or maintain either antagonistic attitude 
or ideology in the revolution. The revo-
lution is going to create, out of itself, the 
side that people are going to have to take. 
It will resolve itself into a case of having 
your allegiance chosen for you, by the 
simple logic of your color. 

The perspective of reality tells us, or 
ought to tell us, two things. First, violence 
is American. And white. Second, in the 
state of tension and jello-sensibilities, it 
may be, perhaps, perhaps, desirable that 
the violence express itself in a controlled 
way--on both sides-in order that the two 
peoples can recommence some more 
creative functioning in their society. In 
this sense, the violence may be desirable. 
If it can be projected that this essential 
violence will result in a plateau of rela-
tionships which are more creative (a 
redefinition of the morality of the two 
races; a miraculous comprehension of the 
futility of this kind of violence in this 
kind of society), then the violence ceases 
to be merely essential and becomes 
desirable. 

Violence in itself is undesirable. As a 
creative artist I have to recognize the 
negativism of violence. But my creative 
imagination does not blind me to the 
greater realities which state, especially 
loudly today, that whether or not I am 
involved in something called art-for-art's· 
sake, I am a member of a society which 
today threatens the elimination of my 
race. And I am aware of the greater values 
deriving from those greater realities. 

There is nothing you or I can do to 
avert this violence, in its political con-
siderations. But there is something you and 
I may do-perhaps will have to do--
once the violence erupts.
