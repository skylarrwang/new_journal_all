**Title: Rhinoceros**
**Author: Ray Ortali**
**Page number(s): 13-14**

If a rhinoceros were to run over a house-
wife's cat, you would probably think that 
the cat had no business being in the 
rhino's cage. If a logician were to tell 
an old gentleman that since a cat has four 
paws, and his dog also has four paws, his 
dog is therefore a cat, you would know 
that you were at an lonesco play. And if 
the old gentleman were of the beatnik 
type, if the housewife were to wear a mini-
skirt, you would realize that you were 
watching the Dramat production of 
Rhinoceros. Let me add right away that I 
love cats (when they are not dogs), mini-
skirts (when they are not worn by bouse-
wives) and Dramat productions (when 
they don't transform a logician into a 
Dr. Leary, who happens to be something 
like his opposite). 

Said Ionesco: "The bad qualities of a 
play are due to the fact that they are not in 
conformity with the play itself." Like-
wise: the bad qualities of the directing of 
a play are due to the fact that they are 
not in conformity with the play itself. 
That, I think, was the problem with the 
Dramat's production. 

Let me quote Ionesco once more: "I 
have been very much struck by what one 
might call the current of opinion, by its 
rapid evolution, its power of contagion, 
which is that of a real epidemic. People 
allow themselves suddenly to be invaded 
by a new religion, a doctrine, a fanaticism. 
... When people no longer share your 
opinions, when you can no longer make 
yourself understood by them, you have the 
impression of being confronted with 
monsters-rhinos, for example. They 
have that mixture of candor and ferocity. 
They would kill you in the best of con-
science." Around 1938, in Bucharest, 
lonesco had witnessed many of his rela-
tives and friends being contaminated by 
the ideology of the epoch, Nazism. The 
play, whose initial purpose was to de-
scribe, in an almost clinical fashion, this 
process of Nazification, had its world 
premiere on the stage at Dusseldorf in 
November, 1959, and the way it was re-
ceived by the German audience proved 
they made no mistake about its meaning. 

For the record, it must be said that Ionesco 
intensely disliked the way the play was 
produced on Broadway. "[In America] 
everybody agreed that the play was funny . 
But it is not funny; although it is a farce, 
it is above all a tragedy. A man watches 
powerlessly the transformation of his 
world; he does not know any more whether 
he is right or not. He struggles hope-
lessly. He is the last one of his kind. He 
is lost. People find that funny!" 

The structure of the work is classic: a 
simple idea (under certain circumstances, 
men become rhinos), a regular progression 
(one anonymous person becomes a rhino, 
then an office colleague, then Beranger's 
best friend, then everybody except Beran-
ger and his girl friend, then everybody 
except Beranger), finally a denouement 
(the paradoxical-and dubious-victory 
of Beranger). In other words, a trap which 
progressively closes upon its victim. But 
in this production, the trap did not work 
perfectly. One of the reasons was that the 
staging was not in accord with lonesco's 
play. This we can see, for instance, in the 
sets of the first two acts. 

In the first scene, brown and sad walls, 
moderate light; in the second scene. a 
brightly lighted and very modern adver-
tising office in Madison Avenue, where 
people seem to have a lot of fun perfecting 
the "bad breath" television ad. Just the 
opposite of the directions given by Ionesco 
and, more important, just the opposite of 
the spirit of the play. Details? Maybe, but 
"the bad qualities of the directing ... " 

Again, in the first scene of the second 
act, Beranger, who has come to John's 
room to apologize for an argument, 
watches as John turns into a rhino. The 
striptease and bellydancing of Jon Marks 
as John were very impressive and in per-
fect accord with the spirit of the play, the 
moral striptease being cleverly paralleled 
by the physical. Then Beranger returns 
to his own room, which is soon besieged 
by a herd of rhinos, increasing in number 
minute by minute, roaring louder and 
louder, from the streets, on the telephone, 
on the television. And here I have no 
fewer than two quarrels with the Dramat 
production. 

First, the decorator has created for 
John a beautifully furnished, sophisti-
cated room, and for Beraoger a very 
shabby one. Now nothing is further from 
the spirit of the play than the implication 
of any social difference between John 
and Beranger: both work eight hours a day 
in the same sort of office, if not in the 
same one. Ionesco, whose stage directions 
are never to be overlooked, is very clear 
on this point. "Beranger's room looks 
surprisingly like John's." Why? To em-
phasize the basic fact that Beranger 
could beÂ·John, and John, Beranger. No 
matter what the dtfferences are between 
the two friends, they are less important 
than their similarities. Beranger finds it 
difficult to summon the energy to meet 
each new day; be is "not used to himself," 
and nevertheless he is the one who re-
mains a man. It so happens that be is 
immune to the "rhinoceritis." John is 
happy with himself, be feels "light, light," 
and yet he is the one who chooses to be-
come a rhino. The opposite couJd just 
as well have been true. 

My second disagreement with the 
Dramat production appears to me the 
more important. The whole last scene 
seems pointless (I am almost sure of that) 
and boring (I am quite sure of that). It 
is partly Ionesco's fault. Beranger's suc-
cessive confrontations with his colleague 
Dudard, with his girl friend Daisy, and 
finally with himself are a little bit mechani-
cal, almost too well planned. It is partly 
the fault of the actor playing Dudard, who 
seemed to have some difficulty in bring-
ing life to the character, not one of the 
best created by Ionesco anyway. But it is

mainly, I believe, a problem with the 
direction. In fact, the solution had been 
outlined by Ionesco himself: "On the back 
wall, stylized rhinos' heads appear and 
disappear, more and more numerous up 
to the end of the act. These heads must 
become more and more beautiful in spite 
of their monstrosity." I do not pretend 
that the heads have to be on the back wall 
or even that they should really look like 
rhinos' heads. Any cinematographic-
or psychedelic--device would be welcome, 
but the absolute imperatives are constant 
motion, constant increase in number (the 
notion of proliferation is dear to Ionesco's 
heart) and constant increase in beauty. 

True, we had once in a while a happy 
bunch of characters with rhino's noses 
dancing around the stage, but this is 
hardly an adequate solution. The rhinos 
must be present all the time and 
must become mor.e and more beautiful. 
This is basic: their growing beauty 
should condition the audience, or at least 
prepare it, to the sudden about-face of 
Beranger, succumbing to the temptation of 
the "rhinoceritis" and shouting, "I am 
not handsome! Th.ey are handsome!" 

Moreover, lonesco took the trouble to 
indicate a second device which, added to 
the first one, should put the audience in a 
sort of mesmerized mood, much the same 
as Beranger's own emotional state. He 
looks at some of his friends' portraits, and 
then puts them on the wall. "The ugliness 
of these portraits contrasts with the rhinos' 
heads, which have become very beauti-
ful." Unfortunately that device also was 
overlooked in the Dramat production, and 
the result is to put on the poor words 
uttered by Beranger a burden that they 
were not intended to bear. 

There is one last problem. The whole 
play has been transported from France to 
the United States, 1968, in order to focus 
the meaning of the play on current Amer-
ican problems. The majority of the 
slides stressed the bad conscience of 
America toward her minority groups and 
toward the violent intervention in Viet-
nam, and seems to disapprove. This is at 
least the impression that I gathered. On 
the other hand, I was told that what the 
director had in mind was exactly the oppo-
site, to castigate the extremists, whether 
on the right or on the left. If this is so, 
he failed to convey that impression, at 
least to me; and in any case, it is at best 
risky to assume common features between 
the "New Left" (even the "New Right") 
and Nazi ideology. Furthermore, even 
assuming it to be proved, the parallel does 
not seem to work. Beranger's ultimate 
loneliness stems from a totalitarian con-
dition. All or almost all his fellow citizens 
are overcome by the "rhinoceritis," and 
especially the bourgeois, the pressure 
groups, the gens en place, the govern-
ment. It seems to me that in 1968 in 
America, Beranger would have, on the 
contrary, no problem at all. 

I have been critical enough of this 
Dramat production to have the right to 
say (and a chance to be believed) that such 
an ambitious production is a most ex-
citing and most welcome contribution to 
a more alive American theater. Jon Marks 
in the role of John was without contest 
the best rhino around. Clay Howe was an 
excellent Beranger, soft-spoken, mar-
velously helpless and once in a while 
genuinely moving. As for the director, 
Leland Starnes, he has an obvious sense of 
theatrics, an ability to manage actors, and 
a lot of imagination. Indeed, why not 
imagine Ionesco's play speaking Amer-
ican? But here the accent is too heavy, 
the intonation overstressed.
