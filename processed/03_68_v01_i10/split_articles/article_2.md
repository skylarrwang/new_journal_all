Robert Penn Warren 
Nothing we had · 
Nothing we were 
Is lost 
All is redeemed 
In knowledge. 
Brother To Dragons 
"Every man is a novelist," says the soft 
husky Southern ·voice. The words tumble 
by. "His hero is himself. His novel is his 
life. He seeks patterns in his life, his 
novel." 

Robert Penn Warren looks over steel-
rimmed reading glasses from face to face 
around the seminar table. His next sen-
tence is emphatic, pitched slightly higher. 
"We look into our past to find out who we 
are." 

Warren checks his gold pocket watch 
on the table in front of him. He pulls off 
his glasses and pushes his chair back from 
the table. The class is over. His creative 
writing students are silent. Finally they 
gather their books and start walking out 
of the seminar room in Silliman College. 
One student whispers, "I could listen to 
him talk for days. I wish he would always 
talk, not read." 

A student walks up to Warren and 
perches on the table by his lecture notes. 
He has fallen behind in the short story he 
is writing. Warren offers him extra time. 
The student says be would rather flunk 
than do less than his best. 
"It wouldn't be fair to you to have to 
read it, and if wouldn't be worth it to me 
to rush through it." 

Warren smiles ironically. "You, sir, are 
an idealist. I am not. I will be glad to read 
anything you write. Writing is a process 
of learning." 

"Red" Warren describes his face as 
typically Scotch-Irish, with a strong jaw-
bone and malarial hollows in his cheeks. 
He wears a tweed jacket, low boots, laced 
and brown, and blue or checked shirts. 
When be reaches for his watch and chain 
at the beginning of class, navy blue sus-
penders stretch over a strong chest. 

He bas the flushed, translucent skin of 
a red-haired man. His hair is thinning, 
short and wavy. Its faded brown hints at 
the red that gave him his nickname. His 
eyes are small, blue, deepset; the lids are 
hooded. His lips are narrow, turned in on 
themselves, speaking of struggles on 
internal landscapes. 

He still looks like his early book jacket 
pictures, though the years have added new 
texture to his face. In repose Warren looks 
grim, thoughtful. A reporter once wrote 
that Warren's expression for photograph-
ers suggests a farmer about to throw you 
off his land. But the downward pull of his 
mouth seems to be a self-conscious ironic 
chuckle after a good laugh. He looks 
remote until he speaks. But then you feel 
his force and warmth. You feel it even 
more when exposed to his streak pf pun-
gent, colloquial humor. He surprises you 
with his joy when he smiles. 

The best contemporary American writer 
of both prose and poetry, Warren is even 
more expressive when he tells a story 
aloud. His voice changes pitch, pauses 
rhythmically or over-syllabizes at the end 
of a phrase in a rich Southern way. Here-
peats a phrase or two for emphasis or for 
pleasure. Often he speaks so fast that 
phrases seem like one word. But more

often his slow cadences hypnotize. 

Robert Penn Warren defines himself 
and his times thro\lgh history. For him 
life is not an eternal present with a future. 
He uses his past to inform and enrich his 
present as a Southerner, a man and an· 
artist. And it is the world of his boyhood 
that has shaped his writer's imagination 
and his sense of history. 

Warren was born in Guthrie, Kentucky, 
in 1905. As a boy he explored his grand-
father's rundown tobacco farm and the 
caves and woods around it. Warren writes 
about the world of his childhood, of his 
grandfather, Gabriel Telemachus Penn, an 
old man, shrunken, with a pointed, clipped 
gray beard. He wore blue jeans which 
hung loose from blue suspenders. To the 
young boy, he looked like General Lee 
without his white horse. 

Tlie old man brought alive the Civil 
War and its impact for the boy. Warren's 
grandfather thought slavery was a bad 
thing, and he did not want to see the 
country divided. But when war came he 
went with his own. 

Mornings, years later, he sat on his chair 
under a cedar tree with a book and his 
pipe. He told his grandson about riding in 
the cavalry with General Nathan Bedford 
Forrest. He told of fighting in winter 
woods and escaping by wading through 
cold rivers. 

"And how dead m.en looked in the river 
bottoms in winter, and I lay on my back 
on the grass, looking up in the thick cedar 
limbs, and I thought how it was to be 
dead." 

Once during the war, Warren's grand-
father headed a command to hunt bush-
wackers in Tennessee. After they caught 
them, the soldiers held brief, roadside 
court proceedings. Then they hanged 
them. When the war was over, families of 
the bushwackers got murder indictments 
against the Confederate troops in Tennes-
see. So after the war, Warren's grandfather 
never returnd to Tennessee, but settled 
in Kentucky. 

"Guerrilla-what's that?" I said. 
"Bushwackers, we called 'em," he said. 
" Were they on the Yankee side?" 
"Son, they didn't have a side. 
Just out to plunder and ride 
And hell-rake the pore countryside. 
Just out for themselves, so son ... 
"Time is short-hell, a rope is -
that's that." 

As his grandfather described the hangings, 
the boy's imagination re-created the young 
man who was now that shrunken old man 
with the pointed gray beard sitting under 
the cedar tree. 

Calmly then, out of the sky, 
Blotting the sun's blazing eye, 
He rode. He was large in the sky .... 
To the great saddle's sway he swung, 
N ot old now, not old now, but young, 
Great cavalry boots to the thigh .... 
The horseman does not look back, 
Blank-eyed he continues his track, 
Riding toward me there, 
Through the darkening air. 
The world is real. It is there. 
History and poetry also infl.uenced 
Warren early in life. Under the cedar tree, 
his grandfather not only told him stories of 
the Civil War, but recited Burns or Byron 
or read to him from Napoleon and His 
Marshals. And Warren was discovering 
history and literature for himself. At six, 
he read "Horatius at the Bridge," at nine
