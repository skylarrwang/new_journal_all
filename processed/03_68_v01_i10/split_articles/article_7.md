lows a similar pattern. He believes the best 
writing courses could be courses in Milton 
or the French novel, and he constructs his 
own class discussions around the analysis 
of a novel or short story. How is the story 
made? he asks. How does it express its 
.aning? How does it fulfill itself? 

Warren's current critical emphasis goes 
far beyond the concentration on the text 
advocated by his earlier textbooks. The 
ltOry comes out of a man's "life context" 
and "life needs." His "life context" is the 
whole period he wrote in: the social con-
text, the conflict of values in his world. But 
there is also an individual with "life needs" 
behind the story. "Every man has his own 
place to scratch, his own little scab to 
pick," Warren says. How does the author 
lranslate his preoccupations and life con-
at into a story that has meaning and 
relevance for others? 

The standard authors Warren talks 
about in class are examples of men grap-
pling with the problems of writing. War-
JeD's sense of history again dictates his 
leDSe of what is most important for a 
writer to learn. Young writers especially 
IDd it hard to understand their relation to 
lbeir own times. Literature courses teach 
bow other writers faced this problem. 
Dreiser dealt with the newspaper, "the 
bot stuff." Hawthorne went back into 
history. The student's sense of his own role 
can be sharpened by these examples. 

Warren and his writing students thrash 
out individual story problems in frequent 
conferences. "I don't think what is done in 
a conference could be duplicated in a class 
of fifteen people. It's too public. It would 
he inhibiting to me and to the students." 
Ia writing conferences Warren encourages 
&lhldent to explain how the story came out 
ef his deeper self, not as a dire, dark auto-
11iosraphical secret, but as the expression 
of a relation between himself and his life. 

One student compared the atmosphere 
ef the conference to a profound conver-
lltion on someone's front porch. Although 
Warren bas made no marks on a story ex-
cept the time of the appointment, be re-
JDembers its details and methods almost 
CIOmpletely. "He gives a general opinion of 
-and then leans back and asks you what 
J'UUr theme is, what are you trying to say. 
After you tell him, he points out which 
ll:enes work toward that end and which 
don't. He suggests alternatives and tells 
JOU to let your mind play over the story, 
letting new associations build up." 

Both Warren and his students find this 
Rperience rewarding. The students sense 
a Wisdom and a deep interest in their prob-
lems and work. Warren himself says that 
tallting personally to students is one of the 
-.est important things be does. It is his 
CIDiy way of continually knowing their 
lraeration. "Otherwise, I'd be going into 
&friend's living room and have his son or 
ll'andson say 'Good evening, sir' and then 
10 out. If you have any curiosity about the 
lbape of the world, teaching is one way 
of seeing something that's happening."

**Title: Counter-demonstrators**
**Author: James Thorpe**

The big American flag at the head of the 
demonstration returned to the Green 
about the time the last of the marchers set 
out for the Induction Center. This meant 
that about six thousand people who 
had turned out on the afternoon of 
March 3, 1968, were strung out through 
the center of New Haven, and the "counter-
demonstrators had some time to kill. 

The professional counter-demonstrators 
knew this was their hour. The Bridgeport 
Anti-Communist Society's mobile grave-
yard circled the Green a couple of times 
on the back of an enormous truck, with 
its row of markers commemorating the 
millions and hundreds of millions from 
Russia to Cuba who have died by being 
forced to live under communism. A seven-
year-old struggled manfully under a sign 
condemning red professors and pink stu-
dents. A leaflet passer was training a man 
in his late twenties in the minimax of 
counter-demonstrating. It was business 
as usual. 

But even professionals are human. The 
man who drives the graveyard exploded at 
the Yale graduate student who led the 
marchers, carrying the flag. "Hey you," 
he began, "you the sonovabitch pushed me 
in the water at Westport .... "An elderly 
patriot with Kresge's Stars and Stripes 
threatened to burn anyone who wanted 
to burn the flag. It must be admitted 
though, he thought most of the peaceniks 
were sincere, and did not object to their 
use of the flag (" ... it's a law that you 
gotta fly the American flag at demon-
strations, to show that you love your 
country ... "). 

For every professional there are half 
a dozen concerned citizens, and a more 
significant number of just plain folks. 
They never meant to be counter-demon-
strators. They just happened to come from 
Madison to shop in the Mall, or from 
North Haven to take their girlfriend to a 
movie when they discovered the march. 
Nobody ever pays attention to profes-
sionals except other professionals. It's 
hard not to pay attention to a concerned 
citizen, however. You know the general 
line: "You ain't worth the air you breathe 
and it's fre~get a bath, you filthy scum 
-if you don't Jove your country, go to 
Russia," and so forth. Do not under-
estimate the concerned citizen. He may 
have a son or a brother or a boyfriend who 
is getting shot at, which is after all the 
kind of thing that makes one concerned. 
He is neither pink-brained nor yellow-
bellied. He's a taxpayer too. He knows 
that America has never lost a war. 

Besides, if the demonstrators are not 
interesting enough to those who passed by, 
there are always the Slum Lords, or the 
Shakers, or the Comrnancheros. They 
pass for motorcycle hoods, complete with 
denim uniforms and Hell's Angels faces, 
until you realize that there aren't any 
motorcycles to be seen, except for the 
massive police Harleys. They have come 
to taunt the cops and to join in the traffic 
jam along the march route in their blue 
Pontiacs and, finally, to exercise their 
right of free speech by singing "The Battle 
Hymn of the Republic." 

And they do attract the younger ele-
ment. Your common garden variety high 
school student, who never seems to have 
much to do anyhow, must pass his Satur-
day afternoon one way or another, and 
motorcycle gangs are entertaining. As the 
speeches started on the other side of the 
rope, wandering twos and threes coalesced 
to the tune of "Glory, glory, hallelujah, 
the truth goes marching on." 

A handful broke from the crowd to see 
whether they could cop the peaceniks' 
flag. "Hey, hey, what do you say, let's 
support the USA," they chanted. 

Meanwhile, Arthur Miller earnestly 
declared that war is not an athletic contest. 
Two dozen eggs were thrown into the 
knot of high school students, but it didn't 
matter, since the eggs were still in their 
cartons. Before long, the enormous sea-
gull which had spent the afternoon on top 
of the WELl flagpole across the street 
headed for sea, and the crowd of high 
school students dissolved like salt in water. 

An elderly Negro policeman turned to 
his fellow officer and said, "OK, Mouse-
keteers, let's take it easy." In a minute, 
William Sloane Coffin would speak. And 
General Westmoreland wants another 
206,000 troops next year.
