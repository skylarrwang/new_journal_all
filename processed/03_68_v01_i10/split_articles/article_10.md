Of all society's laws, the command to kill is 
perhaps the one law which a moral man 
should presume always to disobey--except 
when he has compelling reasons for obeying. 
Ignorance, doubt, the lack of specific opposi-
tion are never convincing reasons for follow-
ing the call to war. Fear of imprisonment or of 
the law are neither moral reasons for killing, 
nor rational reasons for dying. And even for 
the most deeply committed democrat, majority 
approval of a war is not sufficient cause to 
fight in it. To fight, to kill, to die, we would 
need more than a justification of this war. We 
would need conviction-strong conviction 
that what we do is just and right, that the 
destruction of Vietnam is the only way to save 
something as close and as dear to us as the life 
. we might lose. To fight without this conviction 
is to kill wantonly, to sacrifice needlessly. 
The burden of proof-the necessity to con-
vince us with real and irrefutable arguments-
rests with the government which would send 
us off to kill and to die, and not with those of 
us who would refuse to serve. The law tells us 
coÂ·participate in war unless we are forbidden 
by conscience and religion to do so. We believe 
that war is grave enough and horrible enough 
that people should oppose it, unless compelled 
by conscience and survival to support it. 
WE ARE NOT CONVINCED. We will not 
serve this brutal war. We will not cease in our 
efforts to stop it. 
We are told that draft resistance is an in-
tensely personal decision-between a man 
and his conscience-and that civil disobedi-
ence should not be undertaken for political 
ends. Yet our "personal" decision is a matter 
of life or de~th for someone whose conscience 
is not consulted; submission to induction is 
every bit as political as resistance. We are told 
that our conscience cannot be exercised 
through a group; we must act individually, 
one by one. Yet in our name the government 
uses an army, and destroys a nation. We are 
told that two wrongs do not make a right, that 
while the government may be wrong, we 
should not use illegal means to oppose it. Yet 
we do little harm, much less than the harm 
we would do by remaining silent. Can this be 
compared to the systematic destruction meted 
out by U.S. troops and bombers? Finally, we 
are told that were everyone to follow his con-
science instead of the law, it would lead to 
anarchy. Yet Hider came to power legally, 
and Eichmann carried out his duties under the 
law. Has not history shown us a far greater 
danger when everyone follows the dictates of 
government without regard to his conscience? 
Patriotism has often required that men die 
for their country. It is in the spirit of patriotism 
that many 'of us are prepared to go tO jail for 
our country. To oppose this war in silence is 
a crime. And while the government may put 
us in jail, it cannot make us criminals. We will 
meet at I :oo p.m. on the NEW HAVEN 
G RBEN. Please be there to support us; please 
join with us, in the name of America, to end 
this war. 


Many are prepared to resist, but only with 
some assurance that their action will be part 
of a politically effective movement. To break 
esistance 
The war has reached such magnitude that it 
is no longer enough to withdraw our support. 
We must actively work to prevent our 
brothers, American and Vietnamese, from 
killing and dying senselessly. It is a conscienti-
ous act to refuse to commit an atrocity; it is 
also a conscientious act to exercise political 
power to stop an atrocity. On April 3, young 
men throughout the nation will return their 
draft cards to the government, and write an 
explanatory letter to theit boards. Those not 
subject to the draft will stand with them in 
solidarity. By this act, they will serve notice 
on the American people that those asked to 
fight this war do not support it. They will 
demonstrate to the government, in a dignified 
and non-violent manner, that to continue in 
its violence, it will have to imprison many of 
the nation's privileged youth. And because 
virtually all next year's draftees will come 
from this stratum, they can withhold from 
the government the power it needs to increase 
its madness. 

down the sense of isolation, to reduce the 
danger of acting in vain, The Resistance offers 
a pledge: one may agree to resist on the con-
dition that the number of pledges. nationwide 
reaches a specified total (the pledge is grad-
uated from I,ooo to I 5,000). If you are ready 
to resist now, along with the 2,000 others who 
have already done so, we urge that you sign 
the unconditional pledge so that we may 
include you in the nationwide tally. To obtain 
a pledge form, or to discuss any other aspects 
of The Resistance, please call Doug Rosenberg 
at 865-274I, or Rick Bogel at 562-8388. 
Contributions are also welcomed, made out to 
The Resistance, and sent to 68 Norton St. 
Apt. 44, New Haven.
