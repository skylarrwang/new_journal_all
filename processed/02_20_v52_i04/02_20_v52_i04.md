THE  NEW  JOURNAL
I
t’s noon at the call center at the New 
Haven 
Police 
Station. 
The 
operators, 
dispatchers, and supervisors are visible less 
by the ceiling lights, yellow and dim, than by the 
white glare that monitors cast upon their faces. 
These screens are everywhere: three or four per 
person, each with a different spreadsheet or alarm 
system, while another larger screen dominates the 
wall, displaying the names of officers on duty. A TV 
tuned to the news plays silently overhead; no one is 
watching it. A supervisor holds two phones, one for 
each ear, and simultaneously yells information to a 
dispatcher across the room. By the wall, an operator 
stops mid-sentence to answer an incoming call, then 
another; traffic starts to pick up. An active shooter, a 
fire, a panicked mother to be talked through CPR. 
The rapid speech of a dozen-odd employees fills 
the shadowed room. From time to time a joke is 
thrown into the mix, and a short laugh sends a voice 
flying. But always within seconds, that professional 
tone—any call-taker’s best asset—returns to calm a 
desperate caller.


This is a standard day for the New Haven 
Public 
Safety 
Communications 
Department, 
which is responsible for managing the thousands 
of emergencies that flare up across the city daily. 
Although an employee’s duties can differ throughout 
the week, new hires generally begin as operators. 
Known more colloquially as call-takers, their job is 
to handle the initial calls, from the mundane to the 
dire, of those in distress. Senior operators may be 
assigned to the post of dispatcher, coordinating fire, 
police, or ambulance responses to the emergency 
situation. Overseeing all of this are the supervisors, 
typically long-time dispatchers, who watch the list of 
held calls to ensure there is no backlog. The entire 
effort is facilitated by the director of the department, 
George Peet, who has been here since 1997. Each 
morning these employees, many of whom have been 
here as long as Peet has, must wake up and steel 
themselves in whatever way possible for a fresh batch 
of crises.

THE PEOPLE WHO PICK UP
S n a p s h o t :
For New Haven’s 911 operators, the city’s day-to-day emergencies take a toll.

In an office down the hall, the call center’s 
clamor is inaudible. Sunlight streams in from a wide 
window overlooking Route 34. The employees to 
whom I talk range from recent hires to old hands; 
all of them have no shortage of war stories. David 
Mancini, a jovial dispatcher with some top teeth 
missing, recounts a running gun battle that affected 
three neighborhoods and the highway. Debbie 
Thornton, the two-phoning supervisor, was the 
dispatcher for the 2002 drug operation in the Hill 
neighborhood during which Officer Robert Fumiatti 
was shot in the face. “He died three times on the 
way to the hospital,” she tells me. Fumiatti survived 
five more years before suffering a fatal heart attack, 
likely tied to that earlier injury. Another operator 
offers the story of a wife trying to save her overdosed 
husband. For Sheila Villegas, a call-taker of five 
years, the hardest calls are those in which children 
call for their parents or  a child is in distress. “I have 
a ten-year-old at home, so those are always touchy,” 
Villegas said. 


These cases, terrible as they sound, are the 
exception in that the operators eventually learned 
how they turned out. Much of the time, Peet says, 
the trauma of a call does not resolve itself. “Call 
takers talk to people in all types of emergencies, from 
childbirth to stabbings to shootings to houses on fire 
to people trapped to people having their own mental 
issues. We’ve talked people off of bridges—all these 
sorts of things. There’s no closure.”


Yet other factors compound the inherent stresses 
of the job. Work policies, for one, are seen by all 
involved as archaic and often draconic. Peet notes 
that employees sometimes get schedules with 
inconvenient days off, and that many policies are 
driven only by seniority. As a result, it can take years 
as a call-taker before the job starts to pay dividends. 
Benefits, too, are scant. Thornton, a twenty-three-
year veteran of the call center, worked a second 
job at Home Depot until 2018 to support her two 
children as a single mom. In her opinion, daycare 
accommodations, or similar employee support, 
would have made a major difference. 


Mancini, his chair propped up beside a desktop 
Bill Murray sticker, explains that many operators quit 
as a result of the high stakes nature of call-taking. 
“We work in a mistake-free environment. What you 
do—on the phone and the information that the 
call-taker takes, and how the dispatcher dispatches 
it, and how the supervisor’s listening to make sure 
everything goes smoothly—is the difference between 
life and death.” 


He looks at me intently for a moment, then leans 
forward. “Regrets, bro. You don’t want those. That’s 
why whether you just got married or you just won 
powerball and you’re having the best day of your 
life, or she just broke up with you and she’s going 
out with your brother and everything else and life’s 
miserable—you got to deliver.” He gives me a rueful, 
gap-toothed grin.


Peet also sees a lack of public awareness about 
the difficulty of call-taking as another factor 
exacerbating employee turnover. “We kind of get left 
out of the picture an awful lot,” he says. I ask about 
the 911 SAVES Act, introduced last August in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, which would aim to 
bring more prestige and better pay to the profession 
by changing its classification from clerical work to 
protective services. When I mention the Act, Peet 
can’t help but beam. “That would be like ‘God hear 
my prayer’ being answered,” he says with a laugh. 
“Just the fact that [dispatchers] would be seriously 
considered as part of the public safety process. Like 
anything, people want someone to say ‘you do a good 
job.’ It takes a very humble person to do what they do 
and to not get the recognition for it.”


How do call-takers and dispatchers maintain their 
mental health day in and day out, faced as they are 
with the sometimes jarring sequence of calls from 
non-emergencies, such as noise complaints, to calls 
about fires, overdoses, murders, and the like? One 
answer may be institutional support. “The city and 
the department offer EAP, Employee Assistance 
Programs. We’re constantly watching people for signs 
of stress,” Peet maintains. When asked about NHPD 
Chief Otoniel Reyes’s suggestion of mandatory 
mental health check-ins for police officers, he says 
it’s a procedure his department would also be in 
favor of adopting.


Even so, many employees at the call center are 
skeptical of the current mental health infrastructure’s 
efficacy. “Most people are hesitant in utilizing EAP 
because there’s a stigma to it,” says Mancini, rubbing 
his chin. 


Villegas is of a similar mind. “I think partly some 
of the employees don’t feel comfortable admitting 
they need some type of help for their stress levels. I 
think sometimes they may feel weak, or they don’t 
want others to know they’re suffering from some sort 
of PTSD or from certain calls.” Yet the system also 
needs work, not simply the mindset of call-takers. “I 
think that in our department, they just expect you to 
get over it, in a sense,” Villegas notes. “With all first 
responders, I don’t think they make mental health a 
first priority.”


Where institutional tools fall short, personal 
coping mechanisms pick up the slack. Each operator 
has their own tried and true way of destressing. For 
Mancini, this involves “cats, guns, motorcycles, 
martial arts” and his girlfriend, who is reportedly 
“lovely.” Thornton, who recently moved to a farm 
with geese and ducks not far from New Haven, 
relies on baking and smooth jazz for relaxation. Teri 
Nelson Durant, a veteran dispatcher who previously 
worked at a post office, has a ritual of praying every 
morning on the way to work. At home, she takes her 
mind off of work by spending time with her fifteen 
kids. “Grasping them outside of here is what helps 
keep sane,” she says. “It keeps me busy.”


As for Villegas? “Honestly, my therapy is my 
dog,” she says softly, with a tentative smile. “After 
a rough day at work I go home, and he’s there, 
and he’s just so happy to see me—just coming 
home to him and my son, just trying to forget 
about what I went through during that shift.” She

looks at the wall behind me. “Unfortunately, after 
working here for so many years, you kind of get 
numb. Because it’s just one call after another call after 
another call.” 

The call center is more full of banter than one 
might expect, usually through small jibes that sneak 
their way in during the slowest hours of the day. A 
frequent instigator is Mancini, who came in second 
at a recent amateur stand-up competition, and who 
explains somewhat redundantly, after a half hour of 
wisecracking, that he likes to tell jokes: “That’s my self 
defense.” The other operators interviewed largely share 
his thoughts, but it is Durant who most succinctly 
expresses the importance of a sense of humor.  

“Sometimes we have to laugh and joke,” she says with 
a throaty chuckle. A light rain licks the rooftops behind 
her, out the window. “Sometimes we find ourselves 
laughing a lot just to keep from crying.”

Peet suggests that the most heartening consolation 
may come from a sense of purpose. “I don’t want to 
say there’s more positive than negative, because the 
negative’s pretty heavy, but I believe that the positives 
that do occur are so rewarding that they help to wash 
some of the negative away,” he says. “We try as managers 
to instill in their minds that people usually are calling 
911 at some of the most dire moments of their life, and 
you are the person that’s able to help them. So you 
can walk away knowing you did something good and 
valuable on that day.” 

The other operators agree. After his first gig out 
of the military, a post at Town Fair Tire which he 
describes as “a great fucking job,” Mancini says his 
late mother called him up. “She’s like, ‘Why don’t you 
help people?’” He shakes his head. He took the job as a 
dispatcher, he says, to serve the community. “I was born 
here; I was educated here; now I have the privilege of 
working here. I have a vested interest in seeing New 
Haven do well.”

The signature detachment of operators’ voices tends 
to conceal how much the job matters to them. Peet, 
the director, recalls a particularly brutal 2013 blizzard, 
which dumped more than four feet of snow on the city. 
“Any time we sent an ambulance out, within moments 
they were stuck,” he says. He remembers having to tell 
his operators that they could not leave because the 
doors downstairs were blocked. It was impossible for 
emergency services to reach those in need. Employees 
took turns sleeping in the office while their colleagues, 
exhausted as well, told frantic callers that they could 
not help. Caught up in the memory, Peet is somber. 
“As a public servant dedicated to safety, to tell someone 
you’re on your own—that doesn’t fit within anything 
that you have within you, let alone training.”

Before I leave, I sit for a half hour or so with 
Thornton at her desk while she supervises. As she 
recounts the decades’ worth of calls she has fielded, it 
seems like a dam breaks inside of her. The words come 
out in streams. She tells me about cars flipping over, 
cops being shot, how she managed these horrors as a 
single mom trying to raise her kids alone. At last she 
arrives back at the death of Officer Fumiatti, for whom 
she felt responsible as his dispatcher, at which point we 
both realize her cheeks are wet. Out of her hundreds 
of thousands of dispatches, many heroic successes, this 
one remains with her. I ask Thornton how one deals 
with it all. “You don’t,” she says. She turns away; the 
phone is ringing.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
The New Haven Green, the city’s most central 
public park, came to national attention in August 
2018, when 116 people were hospitalized after 
ingesting K2 there. K2 is a drug often described as a 
form of synthetic marijuana, but in reality, the two 
drugs have vastly different compositions, and K2 is 
significantly more dangerous.     

Greene says he has noticed a greater police 
presence since the mass K2 overdose in 2018. 
“They’re definitely around here more since then, 
just making their faces known,” he says of the 
police officers. “It’s probably for the tourists and 
the families that want to come here, I guess. That’s 
their priority.” 

The police aren’t the only people who have been 
frequenting the public park lately. Phil Costello, an 
advanced practice registered nurse and the clinical 
director for Homeless Care at the Cornell Scott 
Hill Health Center, spends much of his time on the 
A
s darkness begins to fall, lampposts flicker 
to life across the New Haven Green, 
illuminating the crisscrossing pathways 
and park benches. The place is almost completely 
deserted, save for a few people emerging from Center 
Church. Ray Greene,  who is currently experiencing 
homelessness and receiving treatment for substance 
use disorder, stands on the corner waiting for the 
bus back to the town of Hamden, Connecticut. He’s 
bundled in a thick winter coat, and wears several 
pairs of thin cotton gloves. On his back he carries 
a large, worn-out backpack, which he says contains 
most of his belongings.

per capita in the country; New Haven County 
consistently ranks among the highest in the state 
for per-capita rates of overdoses, according to the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health. “The 
biggest thing that came out of this whole K2 thing is 
that it made the city more aware of what we all already 
knew, which is that our people desperately need help,” 
Costello says. 

Shortly after the K2 poisoning, then-Mayor Toni 
Harp outlined a number of initiatives intended to 
address the problems presented by substance use 
disorder in New Haven. Through his work on the 
Green, Costello witnessed the implementation and 
effects of these projects firsthand. Among the initiatives 
was the New Haven Police Department’s adoption of 
hot spot technology, which allows officers to track drug 
overdoses throughout the Northeast and anticipate 
spikes in overdoses in New Haven before they occur. In 
the past year, the New Haven Fire Department has also 
partnered with local treatment centers to print cards 
with information about New Haven-based services. 

New Haven Green, stopping at each park bench to 
chat with people and checking the vital signs of 
anyone who appears to be unconscious or at risk 
of an overdose. Greene says he often sees Costello 
making his rounds on the Green. “It’s good to 
know there’s somebody who’s looking out,” he says. 

*
   It’s around dinnertime on a cold night in 
February, and Phil Costello is standing by the 
entrance of the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen 
on Temple Street. He’s leaning against the door of 
his black pick-up truck, wearing black scrubs. He 
carries two heavy backpacks, one slung over each 
of his broad shoulders. Patrons of the soup kitchen 
are shuffling towards the entrance for dinner. 
Many are coming from the New Haven Green, less 
than a block away. Most greet Costello by name 
as they pass, and he does the same. “Hey,” he says 
to a man standing by the entrance and smoking 
a cigarette. “How’re you feeling this week? How’s 
your breathing?” They chat amiably for a few 
minutes, cracking jokes and discussing the man’s 
various health issues.

Costello describes his specialty as “street 
medicine,” which primarily involves checking up 
on members of the New Haven community who 
are experiencing homelessness. Much of his work 
centers around the intersection of homelessness 
and addiction. “The people I usually work with 
spend most of their time just trying to figure 
out how to survive,” he says. “That makes finding 
windows of sobriety and stability in which to 
provide consistent and actually effective treatment 
for addiction or anything else particularly difficult.” 

As Costello sees it, his work both prevents 
unnecessary,  and expensive emergency room visits 
and ensures that people who do need emergency 
treatment at a hospital get it. 

Costello was making his rounds on the Green 
when the 2018 overdoses began, and he was 
one of the first responders to treat the overdose 
victims. Though he describes the amount of K2 
present on the Green that day as an anomaly, he 
believes the event was consistent with the rise in 
substance abuse disorder he had observed on the 
Green in years prior. Connecticut currently has 
the ninth highest rate of opioid-related deaths 
“The people 
I usually 
work with 
spend most 
of their time 
just trying 
to figure 
out how to 
survive.”

Fire Chief John Alston argues that much of the 
solution has to do with simply providing people with 
the information they need to seek treatment. “We 
knew we wouldn’t be able to just arrest or legislate 
our way out of this problem,” he says. Alston believes 
the card program has been successful at directing 
people towards seeking treatment. “Eighty-three 
percent of the calls we get at the Fire Department 
are medical, and a significant number of those are 
going to be drug related,” he says. “If we believe that 
to be the case, we either give someone a card or we 
place it on their person so they find it later. We’ve 
had treatment centers reporting that lots of people 
are coming in seeking treatment because they found 
the information on these cards.” 

Mayor Justin Elicker, who was inaugurated in 
January, supports the emergency responders’ 
emphasis on treatment rather than policing. “City 
Hall’s philosophy on how to address substance use 
disorder is about not criminalizing drug use but 
treating it as a medical issue,” he says. “Nonprofits 
in the city like the APT Foundation treat people 
regardless of whether they’re currently using or not. 
Research shows that you’ll get better results that 
way.” (The APT Foundation is a treatment center in 
New Haven that offers a range of services, including 
several methadone clinics in the area.) 

Mayor Elicker does note, though, that police 
presence on the Green has increased since the K2 
overdose. Phil Costello has noticed this in his work as 
well. “There are a lot of people trying to help out,” he 
says. “But has the increased police presence changed 
the drug issue? Probably not. Police presence is a 
band-aid, not a solution to the problem.”

Former Mayor Harp also created a task force with 
representatives from law enforcement, City Hall, 
treatment centers, non-governmental organizations, 
the Green’s Committee of Proprietors, the churches 
on the Green, and local residents. According to 
Costello, who was involved with the task force, the 
most important thing to come out of the group’s 
work was a proposed plan for a drop-in center and 
clinic near the Green, where people struggling with 
addiction could get treatment. Costello believes 
that establishing such a center would be a critical 
step towards addressing the problems of substance 
use disorder in New Haven. In Vancouver, he said, 
opioid treatment centers that feature supervised 
consumption or injection facilities have been shown 
to reduce the likelihood of overdose-related deaths. 
According to Costello, there are currently two 
ongoing efforts to raise money for a drop-in 
center near the Green, but funding remains a 
significant hurdle. “It would make a big difference 
in the community if Yale would help out with that,” 
Costello says. Yale has historically been involved 
with providing access to treatment services in New 
Haven: the Hill Health Center, where Costello works, 
was founded in 1968 as a collaboration between 
the local community and doctors at the Yale School 
of Medicine. 

As Costello envisions it, the drop-in center would 
include a clinic and a sobering room where people could 
rest and recover in a safe and monitored environment, 
reducing the risk of arrest or hospitalization. “One of 
the biggest problems is that there just isn’t a place 
for these people to be able to go,” he says. “A lot of 
them just need a safe, warm space, where they can be 
consistently addressed by the same people.” The center 
would also have mailboxes where people experiencing 
homelessness could receive mail and staff members 
who could help with scheduling medical appointments. 
“Many people don’t think about this, but for people 
who don’t have regular phone service, scheduling 
medical appointments and getting treatment can 
be extremely difficult,” Costello says. “Even if an 
appointment is made, if nobody ever answers 
the phone to confirm the appointment, it’ll just
 get cancelled.” 

But other recent efforts to open treatment centers 
in New Haven have been met with backlash from 
a group of residents of the Hill, including Ward 3 
Alder Ron Hurt and Ward 4 Alder Evelyn Rodriguez, 
who claim that the city is already saturated with 
social services. Last fall, the New Haven Independent 
reported that community members resisted the Hill 
Health Center’s plan to build a new, $20 million, 
fifty-two-bed inpatient treatment center. Opponents 
argued that further increasing the relatively high 
concentration of treatment centers runs counter 
to efforts to make lower-income neighborhoods 
safer, pointing out that the area around the APT 
Foundation’s methadone clinic in the Hill has been 
the site of a disproportionate amount of crime. The 
plan for the treatment center was ultimately approved 
by the Board of Alders. 

Part of the resistance to the opening of new 
treatment centers in New Haven stems from the 
perception that this initiative would attract people 
from outside New Haven, who might create a drain on 
the city’s social services and contribute to higher crime 
rates. “We need to make sure that the surrounding 
towns and cities are adequately providing programs 
for their residents, so they don’t feel forced to come 
to New Haven for treatment,” Mayor Elicker says. 
“This is part of why this issue centers on the Green, 
because it’s right next to the bus stops, so it’s where 
these people spend their time.” 

But according to Costello, though many people do 
travel to New Haven to receive treatment, they usually 
return to their own communities at night and are 
unlikely to stay in New Haven. “They’re typically 
not the ones spending time on the Green,” he says. 
“Plus, the K2 incident had nothing to do with opiates, 
so blaming opiate treatment centers that are actually 
helping people get better just confuses things.”

Costello believes that building public support for 
the drop-in center near the Green is the most 
important factor in making the center a reality. In his 
view, increasing police presence on the Green without 
expanding access to treatment services nearby serves 
primarily to appease local business owners who feel 
that the prevalence of substance abuse on the Green is 
bad for business. “What we need to do is educate local 
businesses and community members,” he says. “We 
need to let everyone know that if people are inside 
getting help and staying safe, they’re not out in front 
of the storefronts, and they’re not having these issues 
on the Green.” When asked if he thinks the center 
will become a reality soon, Costello grimaces a little. 
“It’s a slow process,” he says, chuckling and shaking 
his head.


Ray Greene says he has noticed the fire department’s 
card program, and believes it’s making a difference. 
“People got to get this information somehow,” he says. 
But he believes a drop-in treatment center near the 
Green would be transformative. “You’ve always got 
to be moving around from place to place to get the 
services in New Haven, so if it was right here I bet a 
lot of the people here on the Green would be doing a 
lot better,” he says. 

He sees the Green as the best possible place to 
spend his time, but he says he wishes he felt more 
welcome there. “A lot of folks think of people hanging 
out on the Green as a nuisance, but I’m not trying to 
be a nuisance,” he says. “I just need a place to be.”  
After spending the night in Hamden, he says, he’ll 
return to the New Haven Green the next morning.

Hillary Browning is a senior in 
Hopper 
College—but 
she 
never 
endured Bingham Hall or made a 
home out of the Hopper Courtyard. She lives 
a few blocks away from Wooster Square Park in 
New Haven. Half-marathon certificates, heart-
warming pictures, and mementos from her 
military past speckle the wall of her apartment. 
Her husband, James, a Navy veteran with a warm 
smile and dressed in a simple t-shirt and jeans, 
greeted us in the home’s foyer as he sat on the 
wooden floors playing with their ten-month-old. 
Round, bright-eyed, and excited but shy, the baby, 
Lily, crawled on a multicolored play mat.

James isn’t the only Navy vet in the house. 
Browning served as a journalist in the Navy for 
six years. Upon retiring from the military, she 
applied to Yale through the Eli Whitney Students 
Program, which provides a pathway to the 
college for nontraditional students—people who 
have taken at least five years away from formal 
education. In August 2016, when Browning was 
24, she moved to New Haven and enrolled at Yale. 
Fewer than two years later, as a sophomore, she 
would give birth to Lily, her first child.

Each veteran carries their own story, reasons 
for serving, and experiences. Browning, a petite 
brunette who loves writing, explained that she 
initially didn’t consider college because of her 
high school grades. She worked at a restaurant 
until a recruiter called her out of the blue due 
to her military entrance test scores. Her parents 
were unconvinced that their sensitive daughter 
would join. At the age of 19, in 2012, Browning 
decided to enter the Navy as a journalist to prove 
her parents wrong. 	

As a military journalist, Browning was first 
stationed in Sasebo, Japan, tasked with creating 
commercials and hosting radio shows for the 
American Forces Networks. While producing 
video-news in Sasebo, Browning met her husband 
James, a bomb disposal technician concurrently 
stationed in Japan.

Eventually, Browning was deployed for seven 
months to Bagram, Afghanistan, where she 
documented military history. She later spent 
time on the USS Eisenhower ship, serving as the 
editor-in-chief of the boat’s daily newspaper. 
For a long time, a school like Yale didn’t even 
seem like a possibility for her. “The military 
teaches you that you’re replaceable,” she said. 
“When people get discharged, they feel like one of 
the many, so they don’t apply to schools like Yale,” 
whose applicants hope to be one of the selected 
few. However, an advisor at Service to School 
(S2S), a non-profit that assists military veterans 
with the college application process, encouraged 
her to apply. “Without the Eli Whitney school 
program, Yale would be inaccessible,” Browning 
said. 

Most military veterans in Yale College are 
enrolled through the Eli Whitney program, which 
has an annual class of around thirty students. 
While the program enrolls students from all 
sorts of backgrounds, it has, within the last 
decade, started to accept more and more military 
veterans. In 2010, not a single veteran studied as 
an undergraduate at Yale; today, there are sixteen 
veterans and one active duty member of the 
Marine Corps in the undergraduate student body. 
Part of what explains this increase is that, in 
2015, Yale became the first participant in Service 
to School’s Vetlink program, which provides 
college counseling for high-achieving U.S. 
military veterans and seeks to match them with 
the nation’s most selective universities.  

Patricia Wei, director of admissions for Yale’s 
Eli Whitney Program, explained that Eli Whitney

students are “academically just like other 
undergraduates but age-wise more like graduate 
students and faculty.” But some Eli Whitney 
veteran students have voiced that fitting in isn’t 
always easy. Former military medic Jake Fischer 
reflected that while “being a veteran didn’t make 
me stick out, being older could be awkward.” 
He described how Eli Whitney students aren’t 
allowed to live on campus and sometimes have 
trouble dating when most of their classmates are 
younger. Andrew Nguyen, a former Army Ranger, 
explained that he wanted to connect with people 
who have different outlooks in order to fully 
experience college life, so he joined an Alzheimer 
Buddies group, the Sigma Nu fraternity, and the 
Rugby team. 

Unlike Fischer and Nguyen, Browning is less 
“plugged in” to extracurricular activities on 
campus. While Browning originally wanted to 
“be super involved,” she “realized how little she 
knew” once classes began. Other students were 
quoting Foucault and seemed well-versed in 
classical texts. In order to catch up, the veteran 
journalist chose to “bare down” on academics 
because “everyone else felt so ahead” and placed 
less of an emphasis on clubs. Browning also has 
different day-to-day priorities than those of most 
undergraduates—instead of going to Toads or 
finding suite parties, she needs to buy groceries 
to cook dinner, get gas for her car, and finish 
renovation projects in her apartment. 

While Browning values her time at Yale, it 
became difficult for her to stay on campus with 
a hungry baby at home. Browning is one of the 
few Yale undergraduates who are parents. She 
said that the parenting support groups at Yale 
that she’s found are mainly geared toward faculty 
and graduate students, so she and her husband 
had to try especially hard to find communities of 
parents. Browning only recently found a group at 
the Office of International Students & Scholars 
and heard about a mom-baby fitness class.  

When Browning first got pregnant, she worried 
about how her baby would affect her schooling. 
She recalls that Risa Sodi, the dean of the Eli 
Whitney program, assured her that being a student 
would offer her a unique degree of flexibility 
during this time in her life.
Browning has built a home in New Haven 
with her husband and child, and she’s found 
community with other parents outside of Yale, 
whom she has met through her daughter. Now, in 
her senior spring, Browning is taking three classes, 
which add up to four hours of class per week. This 
relatively low course load has allowed her to take 
Lily to group playdates alongside her husband.“I 
could let my husband take her alone,” Browning 
said in an email, “but we enjoy watching her 
interact with other little ones, and these meet-ups 
are important for us too.”

As a new mother, Browning could only be away 
from home four to five hours at a time, so there 
have been instances when raising a newborn baby 
has come into conflict with Browning’s classes. 
Last semester, when Browning was taking two 
back-to-back seminars, her husband would bring 
Lily to campus and she would have to step out 
of class to breastfeed her. Browning missed most 
of the career fairs, which were held late in the 
afternoon, when she had to feed Lily. 

“I do lay awake at night wondering if I should 
be in the library more and at home less,” she said. 
“When people say, ‘Wow, how are you doing this 
mom/student thing?!’ I feel guilty, because I feel 
like I’m not actually doing it. My role as a mom 
is secure, but my role as a student feels fragile.” 

But Browning’s undergraduate peers have been 
a source of strength for her. “People usually give 
me too much credit,” Browning said. “I’ve said 
that I’m a mother in classes and people seem 
floored. My husband is a stay-at-home dad. I get a 
lot of support.” 

Browning’s secret society even threw her a 
surprise baby shower. At the party, she received 
face masks and bath bombs, and onesies, toys, and 
blankets for her baby.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
It was snowing when I dialed, raining
when I hung up, chaos even for me
who mixes the chaff back into the wheat
and salts the on-ramps and rakes up needles
only to scatter them on the ground and
walk through as if to cut a covenant,
or sew one together. At dawn, with all
the inertia of imagination,
I laced my boots and cradled the laundry.
Is it even worth it to clean these clothes? 
No matter. When the washer door clicked shut
I knew that ours is not the slipped disk in
the spine of a novel, it’s just the end
and so we wring it out, make it lie flat.

Visitation
When my foot falls asleep I recall that
the body won’t evince itself or mist
its limbs with feeling more often, only
when it needs to tell me to get up and
move along. Last night a spindly old man
told me about the etymology
of a word, an insight so luminous
it made me stir and realize I must
have already known it in order to
dream that I learned it. But like Ishmael,
why say more? Leak awakens knowledge of
lack and now I’m staring at the drip from
the kitchen sink wondering if all the
oceans are peering down the spout, holding back.

**Title: RUNNING ON LOVE**
**Author: LAURA GLESBY**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the first Monday of November last 
year, Americans’ mail slots were unusually 
stuffed with promises. Political hopefuls 
grinned at constituents and flooded inboxes and 
voicemails with last-minute Can-I-Count-On-Your-
Votes. Across New Haven, a divisive mayoral race 
huffed its last bitter breaths in the eighteen hours before 
election day. For a moment, the frenzy found its way 
to an uncontested aldermanic race in New Haven’s 
twentieth ward, as Delphine Clyburn wedged flyers 
behind doorknobs on the block just around the corner 
from her Newhall Street house. 

Clyburn was running unopposed for her fifth two-
year term as alder of New Haven’s Ward 20, which spans 
much of Newhallville, a neighborhood at the northern 
border of the city with a majority-Black and low-income 
population. Clyburn had an hour and a half to canvass 
before she needed to leave for her 2 p.m. work shift at 
a state-run group home for adults with developmental 
disabilities. In New Haven, alders receive a stipend 
of $2,000 a year; most have to work full time jobs in 
addition to their political responsibilities. 

The majority of the block’s residents were at work, 
so she slipped flyers through mail slots and slid them 
between door hinges. Her silver hair was clipped back 
in a characteristic bun, aside from an orderly wisp 
that swept across her forehead. Occasionally, Clyburn 
stopped to greet pedestrians with a hug before checking 
whether she would see them at the polls the next day. 

On the day before the election, in a ward with over 
four thousand residents, Clyburn handed out only 
about two dozen flyers. She had chosen the particular 
block not because it would be politically strategic, but 
because 89-year-old Ella Anderson lived there, and 
Clyburn wanted to pay her a visit. 

When Clyburn knocked, Anderson (whose name 
has been changed in this story to protect her privacy) 
answered the door in a flamingo-colored nightgown, 
wearing curlers in her hair. Anderson ushered us inside 
and dragged out chairs for us at a dining room table 
covered in a red plastic tablecloth. Small heaps of mail 
rested on the table before us.

Anderson brought out materials she would need 
to renew proof of her eligibility for Connecticut’s 
Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income 
households pay for heat in the winter, by filling out 
forms for a local non-profit called the Community 
Action Agency of New Haven. Clyburn was putting 
the pre-election rush on hold that morning to help 
Anderson reapply for the government benefit that 
would keep her house warm.

For another politician, the visit to Anderson might 
have been an unusual detour. But Clyburn treated it as 
just another part of her job. On and off election season, 
Clyburn frequently goes “on the doors” both to visit 
with and advocate for her constituents. Local activists 
attest that since Clyburn took office in 2012, the change 
has been palpable in Newhallville. Her ward is slowly 
becoming a neighborhood city officials can no longer 
ignore. 

*

For most of her childhood, Clyburn was whisked 
from home to home, for reasons that often only made 
sense to her in retrospect. Her parents died in separate 
car accidents—her father first, and then her mother. 
She knows that she was 3 years old at the time of her 
mother’s death because at age thirteen, she found a 
newspaper clipping about the crash in a Connecticut 
public library. Soon after the accident that killed their 
mother, Clyburn and her older sister found themselves 
under their great aunt’s care in North Carolina.

“She made sure everything was clean,” Clyburn 
recalled of her great aunt. (Since then, Clyburn has 
kept her living spaces immaculate; her kids used to call 
their home “the museum.”) But Clyburn said that if she 
so much as misspelled a word in her homework, her 
great aunt would beat her. Her great aunt also implored 
them not to trust anyone: “You don’t depend on nobody,” 
Clyburn remembers her saying.

In that house, Clyburn grew up playing baseball and 
kickball, skating and riding bikes. She would cut out 
her own paper dolls and build paper houses for them, 
with paper furniture. But when her grandfather came 
to visit during the summers, Clyburn recalls that he 
noticed her aunt’s abuse and arranged for her to move 
to another aunt’s home in Bridgeport, Connecticut. 

In Bridgeport, Clyburn found herself living with four 
younger kids she had never met.

That aunt made a habit of disappearing, according to 
Clyburn; some weeks, she would leave the house Friday 
and come back Monday. In her absence, Clyburn, who 
was 13 at the time, said she took care of the four younger 
children also living in the house. “I was practically like 
the mom around the house,” Clyburn said. “I knew 
how to run a house, keep it clean.” 

One day, when her aunt was absent, she decided to 
make hot chocolate for the other children in the house. 
She boiled water on the stove, and the water spilled 
onto one of the other kids—she doesn’t remember 
how—burning one girl badly enough that she had to 
go to the doctor. After a year with the aunt who was so 
often gone, Clyburn wound up in her first foster home.

Clyburn’s first set of parents assigned through the 
foster system had always wanted a daughter. The 
Watsons were an elderly couple with no other children, 
and Clyburn felt loved there. But one day, Clyburn 
found herself reassigned to a new foster family, where 
eight other kids—including one of Clyburn’s biological 
brothers she didn’t know she had—resided. 

Clyburn recalls that one of the other foster children 
living in her new home could not hear or speak. The 
girl soon wrote Clyburn a letter saying that the father of 
the house “touched her,” as Clyburn recalls it. Clyburn 
was 15 and scared; she had been scared of the father 
even before receiving the letter. Unsure of what to do, 
she initially kept the letter to herself, and prayed by a 
stream of water outside the house each night: Lord, help 
me get out of this house. Help me. Help me.

Soon, her foster sister “began to show,” Clyburn said. 
In the letter, the girl had only confided that the father 
“touched” her. But the truth revealed itself in the form 
of a fetus. As a ward of the state, according to Clyburn, 
the girl gave birth and was forced to relinquish her 
baby. The whole family had to go to court. Clyburn 
said she brought the letter with her and testified against 
her foster father. Each child was relocated to a different 
house.



A triangular patch of grass two blocks away from 
Anderson’s home, where Starr Street intersects with 
Shelton Avenue, was once called the “Mudhole” — the 
center of New Haven’s drug trade. In the nineties, a pair 
of articles in the New Yorker explored gang dynamics at 
the Mudhole as a case study of urban decay in an era of 
deindustrialization. At the time, the gradual shutdown 
of Newhallville’s primary employer, the Winchester 
Arms Factory, spiked unemployment rates in the area. 
The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, notorious for its 
racist policies, had redlined Newhallville decades earlier, 
marking it a “definitely declining” neighborhood and 
paving the way for institutional discrimination against 
its residents. In media portrayals, a reputation for crime 
and poverty followed Newhallville for decades. In 2013, 
the Yale Daily News described the neighborhood as 
“among the poorest and most dangerous parts of the 
city,” claiming that it was “still not a safe place to walk 
late at night.” 

Local activists were committed to advocating for 
more opportunities and resources for Newhallville. In 
2010, residents organized in response to a controversial 
plan to convert the former Winchester Arms Factory 
into a mixed-use building that would house, in part, a 
tech company focused on financial aid reimbursement. 
The activists held weekly meetings on Mondays in a 
prominent New Haven church. They demanded that 
the developer employ more Newhallville residents for 
the construction of the building. 

Clyburn heard about the meetings and decided to 
show up to one of them—and then another, and another. 
She had been involved in labor organizing for decades; 
since 1987, she had served as a delegate for the statewide 
1199 Healthcare Workers’ Union, representing colleagues 
across Connecticut in disputes with management. She 
even volunteered at one meeting to invite then-Mayor 
John DeStefano to her home to press him about the new 
development. When they met, Clyburn felt that DeStefano 
didn’t sufficiently address her concerns about local hiring. 
After their conversation, she sent him a thank-you note 
asking “why he didn’t care for every part of his city.” 

At one of the meetings, Clyburn met another 
Newhallville neighbor, Shirley Lawrence, who was 
then a lead organizer for a union-affiliated non-profit, 
Connecticut Center for a New Economy. 

“She stood up and asked probably the most important 
questions in the room,” Lawrence said of Clyburn. “I was 
looking at her like, whoa, O.K., this is a pretty strong lady 
here.”

Lawrence’s job involved identifying and mentoring 
community leaders. After the meeting, she met 
separately with Clyburn to urge her to run for alder 
of Ward 20. At the time, Lawerence said, people in 
Newhallville tended to distrust politicians; she felt that 
her neighbors were ready for a change. Clyburn agreed 
to run in 2011 and picked Lawrence as her campaign 
manager. After the Democratic primary, the New Haven 
Independent reported that Clyburn, who was new to 
politics, defeated the incumbent alder, Charles Blango, 
with a decisive 58 percent of the vote.

How did she pull it off? “She probably knocked on 
every door in the neighborhood,” Lawrence said. “And 
she still does it to this day.”


At her third and final foster home, Clyburn did not 
have to worry about a predatory caregiver. But she didn’t 
breathe more easily, at least not at first. Eight other kids 
lived with the Coversons at the time, and three more 
would eventually arrive. Each day, the father would 
bring the kids candy bars after work. Still, Clyburn 
remained guarded. “Trust no one,” she recalls thinking. 
When she came home from school each afternoon, she 
would immediately retreat to her room. Her new foster 
mother expressed love for her anyway, promising that 
she would be there whenever Clyburn could trust her.

Once, when Clyburn was still a teenager, Mrs. 
Coverson told her that she wanted to adopt her. She 
wanted to give Clyburn their family’s name. But by that 
time, Clyburn was engaged. She told Mrs. Coverson to 
adopt the younger foster children in the house instead. 
“I had that thing in me—do for yourself, make your 
own way,” Clyburn said. “That’s from my aunt. That 
stayed with me.”

Clyburn met her husband, Michael, through the 
Coversons’ Bridgeport church, which was affiliated 
with his North Carolina congregation. “We dated over the 
phone and through the mail,” she said. They met three 
times in person before they got married. Clyburn was 19. 
The Coversons were reluctant to support the marriage; 
a part of them wanted Clyburn, and all her siblings, to 
remain in the house forever. But the Coversons worked 
with Clyburn’s high school friends to put together their 
wedding. 

Forty-one years later, Clyburn and her husband are still 
together. They moved to New Haven in 1986, buying the 
Newhallville house they still live in. The couple hashave 
started multiple churches, and currently run Grace and 
Peace Cathedral International on Starr Street. In the 
backyard of their home, greenery flows amidst stone 
statues. Occasionally, the neighbor’s cat wanders through 
the yard, around the house, out to the sidewalk. Blue-and-
white birdhouses adorn trees. Wind chimes sing on the 
back porch. 


The most anger I’ve ever heard in Clyburn’s voice 
came out as she scrolled through her phone to show me 
a photograph of a demolition site in the neighborhood. 
In the image, which she’d captured the other day, a pile 
of bricks and debris lay outside a crumbling building. 
Clyburn said she had asked the site’s manager to throw the 
wreckage into a dumpster, but the manager said that the 
dumpster would overflow. “So. What?,” Clyburn flared. 
“Get the dumpster.”

We sat on green plastic chairs inside the Orchid Cafe 
on Winchester Avenue. On Clyburn’s cell phone camera 
roll, photographs of her newborn grandson interrupted a 
stream of images of sidewalk cracks and untrimmed trees. 
“I ride around this city,” she said. “I ride around this city 
[in my car] to see how every neighborhood is faring.” 
She sees a disparity in the way many city employees 
treat constituents in different neighborhoods; she has a 
particular grudge against the Trees department, which 
she claims doesn’t adequately trim the trees in her ward. 
Construction sites in the city’s wealthier neighborhoods 
don’t look like the one in the image she has just shown me, 
she said. She’s concerned about contaminated materials 
that could spread through the debris. But for Clyburn, 
developers’ lack of dumpsters is about more than just the 
health risk. “They don’t even respect us.” 

Soon after she got elected, Clyburn set out to fill the 
lapses in the city’s care for Newhallville from the ground 
up. She enlisted someone on every street to report back to 
her about each block’s condition. These neighbors would 
inform her about poor property upkeep, whether someone 
was sick, whether someone had passed away. Neighbors 
have also told her about suspected drug deals occurring

in nearby houses. Clyburn said she has parked outside of 
those houses for hours at a time, watching cars driving 
in and out, to see if the complaints checked out before 
relaying them to landlords or to the police. She recalled 
that one day, as she was walking down Reed Street, 
someone came up behind her and imitated the sound of a 
gun, threatening her. Clyburn kept walking. “I didn’t pay 
them no attention,” she said calmly, “because I know why 
I’m out there.” She scrolled through more photos on her 
phone, showing me the license plate of a double-parked 
car and a pile of chopped-up tree branches lying on the 
sidewalk.

“When I took this ward, I fought for this ward. For 
Downtown to even care about us,” Clyburn told me. “I 
felt like we were foster kids with no voice.” 
Clyburn goes to constituents’ homes nearly every 
week—not only to help them apply for government 
programs, as in Anderson’s case, but also to spread the 
word about public meetings, or to check in about whether 
landlords have responded to grievances. When she meets 
with constituents, she’ll ask about their daughters or how 
their health has been lately. These visits, she says, are her 
way of “loving on them.” 
On a day off from work, she once spent six hours talking 
to residents of an elderly housing complex in her ward 
who had complained of slow repairs. She made a habit of 
driving bimonthly food deliveries from a nonprofit called 
FISH to her homebound neighbors; she and three friends 
delivered food to all of FISH’s clients in the ward. When 
14-year-old Tyrick Keyes died from gunfire in her ward 
in 2017, Clyburn sat with his mother in the hospital and 
mobilized neighbors to cook food for her after the funeral. 
“My Reed Street is my love street,” she said in passing 
once, in reference to the street where Keyes’s family lived. 
“It’s not just a portion who should be loved,” Clyburn 
said; every part of the city deserves equal access to 
resources. “I call it love,” she added. “But love could be 
the way we let development come, the way we let our 
schools be, housing, the cost of things, how they keep 
things clean, our parks, whatever. Everybody should be 
treated the same. But everybody was not.”

Door by door, Clyburn has urged neighbors to demand 
love from a political system that was never meant to hear 
them. When she first got elected, she found fifteen of her 
neighbors willing to commit to serving as community 
organizers within the ward. Alongside Clyburn, the team 
of fifteen met regularly and urged neighbors to vote, 
join city commissions, and voice their opinions at public 
hearings. 
Newhallville “changed a hell of a lot” since Clyburn 
took office, Lawrence said. “She let people know that you 
actually can trust someone that’s in politics… From day 
one, it was about the people, until today, it’s about the 
people.”
The difference could be felt from the highest office in 
City Hall. “When I think about Newhallville when I first 
ran … I went to some of the streets not too far from here,

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
and there was a real sense of despair,” New Haven’s former 
mayor, Toni Harp, said at Clyburn’s re-election campaign 
launch in July 2019. Harp and Clyburn both took office 
in 2012. “What we’ve seen happen here… we have seen a 
transformation,” Harp said.
Newhallville’s Ward 20 now has one of the highest 
rates of voter turnout of all thirty wards in New Haven; 
Newhallville resident Barbara Vereen proudly declared 
the ward to be “the highest voting Black ward in this city.” 
When Barack Obama ran for re-election as president in 
2012, over two thousand voters waited in an hours-long 
line in Ward 20, the third-largest turnout in the city, close 
behind the whiter and more affluent neighborhoods of 
East Rock and Westville.
Five years ago, during her second term in office, 
Clyburn and other community activists beautified and 
rebranded the “Mudhole” as “the Learning Corridor.” 
One nearby resident, Doreen Abubakar, secures regular 
grants to fund biking and outdoor education programs 
there. The block hosts an annual Harvest Festival in the 
fall. In August, child reporters in the neighborhood’s 
Kids TV program released a mini-documentary about the 
block’s dramatic transformation. 
During 
this 
period, 
Newhallville’s 
Community 
Management Team—one of the city’s twelve neighborhood-
based committees that provide an opportunity for residents 
to weigh in on new development projects and hear updates 
from city officials—grew to become one of the most active 
and effective in town, at least on par with those of New 
Haven’s wealthiest neighborhoods. Clyburn was one of 
the people who worked to bolster the group, urging more 
and more of her neighbors to come out to meetings. A 
group of more than thirty people, mostly Newhallville 
residents, had come out for the group’s monthly meeting 
in September 2019, sitting around several circular tables 
with built-in blue stools. 
As neighbors and guests offered updates and 
announcements, the Management Team’s chair, local 
preschool director Kim Harris, rallied the group to 
participate in upcoming events. It didn’t seem to matter 
what people advocated for; what was most important 
to Harris was that the neighborhood’s voice was heard. 
“Let’s flood the house with Newhallville people,” she 
said, referring to a city meeting about public housing. 
Of another public meeting: “I just want to flood [it] with 
Newhallville people ‘cause there’s a lot of things going on, 
and we’re gonna know about it.”
Soon, Harris announced a gala hosted by the Board of 
Alders’ Black and Hispanic Caucus in late October. She 
wanted to have a table of Newhallville residents there. 
Tickets were seventy-five dollars, but to Harris, they were 
well worth the cost. “That’s the best seventy-five dollars 
I’ve ever spent,” she told the group. “I get to tell them, 
‘Newhallville, Newhallville, Newhallville.’”
She urged the group to go. “If we got to lay away twenty 
dollars a week to make it, let’s lay away twenty dollars a 
week so that we could be amongst the people making 
decisions for us.”

Clyburn’s relationship-centered, community-powered 
approach to political leadership has proven its power, but 
it’s also taken a toll. By her fourth term as alder, a few of 
the neighbors she most relied on had passed away. Clyburn 
tried to take on their work by herself. “Things started—I 
started breaking down,” she said. She swallowed, held her 
voice together. “It’s a lot to take on, one person.”
Clyburn began to receive calls about Ward 20 during 
her shifts at the group home where she worked, which 
sometimes got her into trouble with her boss. Her doctors 
implored her to take better care of her health. She had 
also started withdrawing from her personal finances to 
assist her constituents—particularly the elderly residents. 
She would help cover light bills and gas bills. Clyburn 
even paid one hundred dollars to remove a wheel boot 
that the city had placed on a young man’s car. “He had to 
go to work,” she said. “I didn’t really know him that well, 
but he was in my ward.”
Throughout her forty-one-year marriage, Clyburn was 
in charge of paying the gas and electricity bills for her and 
her husband’s home; the rest of her paycheck was hers 
to spend on what she wanted. But as she lent money to 
her constituents, Clyburn began to ask for her husband’s 
help with utility bills. Their kids were paying their own 
expenses, and her husband grew suspicious. Someone 
finally told him that she had been helping neighbors with 
expenses; now, she has to make up the lost money herself. 
Clyburn laughed as she recalled what her husband said: 
“Nobody’s gonna help us Delphine, remember?” 
Clyburn started to work overtime to make up for the 
money she gave to her constituents, sometimes starting 
her shift at 6 a.m. and leaving at 11 p.m. “I was putting 
the ward before my health, and my family, everything,” 
Clyburn said. 
There is only so much love—only so much time, only 
so much money—that one person can muster. “I’m still

now trying to pull out of my financial base from what I did 
to my family,” Clyburn said. “I’m struggling back now to 
rebuild our little nest egg over the years.” 

Time slipped by inside Ella Anderson’s home on 
Starr Street. Channel 8 hummed on the TV in the 
living room, interrupted by occasional Black Friday ads 
and a paid message from then-mayoral candidate Justin 
Elicker. Sitting at the dining room table, Clyburn took 
out one of the required Energy Assistance forms and 
walked Anderson through it, pointing out the places 
where a signature was required. Periodically, Anderson 
retreated to the kitchen and brought out another form 
or bill that seemed redundant or perplexing. The papers 
accumulated on the table amidst piles of notecards and 
mailers and other receipts. Slowly, Clyburn and Anderson 
pieced together the source of confusion: it seemed that 
the Community Action Agency of New Haven had sent 
Anderson an extra form.
“If I could just get a person to talk to me…” Clyburn 
said.
As Clyburn called up the Community Action Agency, 
Anderson read the words printed on Clyburn’s campaign 
flyer in a murmur: Strong constituent services… She 
proclaimed that the photograph on the flyer was beautiful. 
No one answered Clyburn’s call. The agency’s voicemail 
was full. 
Anderson retrieved a new form from the pile, and 
Clyburn read aloud that Anderson could learn more 
about the status of her benefits if she created an online 
account, accessible on her computer and smartphone. 
But Anderson doesn’t use the Internet. “I keep telling 
them, they think everyone has that,” Clyburn sighed.
Clyburn gently folded the Energy Assistance forms 
and placed them on top of a pile of mail. “These are very 
important,” she said. 
Next time, Clyburn said, she’ll come with a plastic bin 
and a set of dividers. She’ll sit down and help Anderson 
organize her financial records by year.
“I figured, if I could have you, things could work out,” 
Anderson told Clyburn. “I’m just not used to people going 
out of their way to help me.”
But Clyburn couldn’t stay forever. It was almost 1 
p.m., and she had to be at work in an hour. She stood up 
soon after to leave the house and cross the street, where 
she would deliver a few last election flyers to people’s 
doorsteps.

In Connecticut, death doulas aim 
to ease the transition to the other side.
Design by Rebecca Goldberg 


Susan Clark, age 5, would shiver in her bed. The 
heat never reached the room on the top floor that 
she shared with four siblings. In the middle of the 
night, she braved the stairs in the darkness to use 
her eldest sister’s bathroom on the floor below. It 
was that, or peeing in a bucket. 

That year, her 2-year-old sister died. “She just 
disappeared,” Clark, whose name has been changed 
in this story to protect her privacy, said sixty years 
later. “My parents never talked about it. She was just 
gone, gobbled up in the night.”
Clark never found out what happened to her 
sister, only that her parents didn’t have enough 
money to pay for a doctor. Later in the year, she 
started school in Valley Stream, New York, and 
discovered a funeral home across the street. During 
recess each day, redheaded Clark crossed the street 
and entered the facility. The managers let her into 
the home, where she ambled through a room full of 
open caskets. “I’d go in and look at the people, and 
collect all the little memorial cards,” Clark said. 
Death once again touched her life decades later, 
in February 2019, when her youngest sister Joe 
died of a fentanyl overdose at age 56. She left no 
will, only a scribbled note for Clark that mentioned 
that she wanted to be cremated. That’s when the 
chaos began. 

The rest of Clark’s family was Catholic, and 
demanded embalmment and a burial. Yet after Joe’s 
autopsy, Clark couldn’t stand thinking about how 
uncomfortable her sister would’ve felt with the 
embalming process. “I was extremely embarrassed, 
because of how private she was.”
As Clark lived closest to Joe’s home in Hamden, 
she exercised the legal authority to cremate her 
sister. “I rushed to everyone’s hate list. My eldest 
sister threatened to sue me. Now no one speaks to 
me. I lost Joe, I lost the whole family.”
Clark believes that her family’s inability to discuss 
death led to the division between her and her 
siblings. But Clark wants to be different from her 
family. After stumbling upon a New York Times 
article about death cafes—monthly meetings for 
people to chat about death over cakes and tea—she 
decided to venture to her first one in late July 2019 
at Koffee?, a cafe in New Haven. She’s only missed 
one session ever since. These nighttime meetings 
provided Clark a space to talk about her sister again, 
to share with others the lonely journey she’d been 
on ever since Joe’s death. It was her doorway into the 
death positivity movement, which has been slowly 
altering how people approach death and dying across 
the country.

Two nights before Halloween, Nathalie Bonafé, 
with her gray pixie cut and a scarf knotted around 
her neck, commenced the tenth death cafe of the 
year by inviting attendees to introduce themselves. 
A newcomer named Amber, dressed in a pea green 
cardigan, went first. “I’m here because I’m 63 years old 
and childless.” With no children to care for her and 
her husband in their old age, she said, she worried 
about dying alone.

A tray of vanilla scones and chocolate chip muffins, 
sugary crust glistening in the reddish lamp light, 
passed from hand to hand. Bonafé, the moderator 
of the discussion, broke eye contact with Amber to 
place a scone on a napkin. Dripping rain jackets hung 
from the backs of chairs in the cafe. Of the twenty 
people who had gathered, some were past middle age 
and worried about the future. Others were doctors or 
hospice care workers. Four, including Bonafé, were 
death, or end-of-life, doulas, non-medically trained 
people who are hired to help those approaching the 
end of their lives. The rest were just curious. Amber, 
perched on a stool, passed the tray of desserts to Mo, 
an energy healer (whose name has been changed 
in this story to protect her privacy), with large eyes 
magnified by thick rectangular glasses. Across from 
Mo sat a young woman sporting devil horns and a 
young man dressed as the Joker. Behind the couple 
sat a young botanist and a middle-aged man with 
wooden beads around his neck. 

As the introductions finished, Bonafé cleared her 
throat. “Thank you all for sharing,” she said. “I want to 
reiterate that we’re here to be human together. We’re 
here to embrace our humanity.”
Stories tumbled from participants’ mouths, as the 
warm lamp lighting and the scent of coffee grounds 
weakened inhibitions. Another death doula with 
curly bangs covering her forehead spoke about a 
client, a terminally ill 49-year-old Ghanaian woman 
with a husband and numerous teenage boys. “Why 
her? Why not me?” she asked. 	

In response, a middle-aged man shared that his 
daughter is non-verbally autistic. After spending years 
questioning “why me,” he decided upon a new world 
view. “I believe in a deterministic world,” he mused. 
“We’re living in this beautiful machine.” He 

had surrendered control over what happened in his 
life, and tried to live in peace with his circumstances. 
Bonafé, delighted, sipped her coffee. “I’m going to 
have to smoke a cigarette after this because I’m on 
such a dopamine high. Just being present here with 
all of you—it’s beautiful.”

The death positivity movement aims to destigmatize 
death and transform it from the terrifying to the 
peaceful. From death cafes to end-of-life doulas, the 
movement supports those who feel sidelined by the 
medical system. 

In some ways, “death positivity” is a return to the 
way people used to relate to death. According to 
Stephen Latham, a bioethics and political science 
professor at Yale, death was not a taboo subject 
before the medical advancements of the twentieth 
century. Prior to the invention of antibiotics in the 
years following World War II, simple infections killed 
people, sometimes within hours. “There was almost 
nothing that medicine could do to stave off death,” 
said Latham. The inefficacy of early medicine against 
disease made death a less predictable, pervasive force 
in communities. The stigmatization of death, according 
to Latham, is more of a modern phenomenon.

In 1953, the polio vaccine was invented. A year 
later, the first successful organ transplant occurred. 
Two years after that, metastatic cancer was treated 
successfully for the first time. By the 1970s, doctors 
became skilled enough to keep terminally ill patients 
alive, making death a long, drawn-out process. 
“Medicine got good enough to be burdensome,” 
Latham said, or powerful enough to maintain 
patient’s lives at the expense of a good quality of 
life. Death moved from home to hospital, causing 
people to spend their final days secured on a gurney 
surrounded by masked doctors, attached to tubes and 
blinking machines. According to a 2016 study, 72 
percent of Americans die in hospitals. 

As more people died under fluorescent lights in 
hospitals, death became removed from everyday life. 
The death positivity movement, said Latham, is an 
attempt to oppose that change, “to make death more 
calm, more beautiful, more anticipated,” something 
that can be normalized and embraced.

There are nine end-of-life doulas registered in 
Connecticut with the National End-of-Life Doula 
Alliance, which includes 288 doulas nationwide. 
From advocating for their clients’ needs in hospice 
care centers and arranging financial plans to making 
cups of tea and having deep conversations, doulas 
bring guidance to those who confront the medical 
system in the weeks before death. 

When Bonafé, owner of a private death doula 
practice called A Gentler Parting, takes on a client, 
she never knows how she will end up assisting them. 
If the client asks for a shaman, lawyer, or financial 
consultant, she finds one. If the client is in pain, 
Bonafé consults nurses to readjust pain medication. 
If the client’s family members are in distress, she talks 
them through any fears they may have. The crux of the 
job, according to Bonafé, is being a loving presence. 
“They just want the company,” explained Bonafé. “We 
let them be in this circle of love.” 

Bonafé’s fees depend on a client’s needs. She charges 
$500 for two to three preliminary meetings, which 
last around six hours each. She meets with the client’s 
family and combs through legal documents, such 
as wills and advanced healthcare initiatives, which 
outline a patient’s end-of-life medical wishes. In total, 
most clients end up paying between $2,000 and $6,000 
for a doula’s services. “Once people understand what 
I bring to the table, they have no problems with my 
fees,” she wrote. “I can help them save aggravation and 
money overall by helping them think rationally instead 
of out of fear.”

Despite increased media coverage in The New York 
Times and Wall Street Journal, end-of-life doulas are 
still relatively unknown. When Bonafé attends dinner 
parties and describes her job to people she’s just met, 
they often respond with shock and confusion. Many 
people do not learn about these services, or understand 
them, until it’s too late.

Chanel Reynolds was one of those people. In 2009, 
Reynolds received a phone call that changed her life. 
Her husband José, 32, had been struck by a vehicle 
while biking. Reynolds spent the next week in the 
ICU, torn not only by the possible loss of her young 
husband, but by the logistics of death: she and José 
weren’t prepared to die. After the first forty-eight 
hours at the hospital, the doctors told Reynolds that 
José would never recover. They inundated Reynolds 
with questions: did they have disability insurance? Did 
José write a legal will? Did he have an advanced care 
directive? Would he want her to pull life support? 
Reynolds’ most pressing thought was: what would

happen if she pulled the plug on her husband? How 
long would it take for him to pass away? (She has 
since learned that the time frame can range anywhere 
from immediately to a few weeks.) She realized how 
little she knew, standing in the sterile hospital hallway, 
helpless. “That was a whole new pitch-black room 
that I was looking into,” Reynolds said. 

Without guidance, the process of facing death or 
grieving can be overwhelming, even all-consuming. 
With only doctors to direct her through the process, 
Reynolds felt lost.

The work done by death doulas often overlaps with 
the treatment provided by palliative care doctors, 
who offer the most holistic medical care available 
for patients suffering from long-term or terminal 
illness. At Yale New Haven Hospital’s palliative 
care department, a doctor first evaluates a patient’s 
condition on a scale of zero to one hundred, with 
one hundred indicating perfect health. Afterwards, 
the patient sits down with the doctor to outline their 
“Goals of Care,” which allows the palliative care team 
to understand what matters most based on the patient’s 
desires and preferences. The doctor then constructs a 
plan of care, which may include pain medication and 
physical therapy. Similarly, doulas sit down with their 
clients to talk through what they want most in their last 
few weeks. The doctors connect patients with chaplains 
and art therapists, something that death doulas also 
regularly do.

But there is a systemic shortage of palliative care, 
which makes palliative care departments short-staffed 
and limits the amount of time that can be spent on 
each patient. While there are only 1,400 palliative care 
centers nationwide, 42 percent of all Americans have 
had a friend or relative suffer from terminal illness in 
the past five years. Palliative care specialists at Duke 
University estimated in June 2019 that there is 
one palliative care physician for every 808 general 
patients in the United States. At Yale New Haven 
Hospital, the palliative care department, comprised 
of twenty-five staff members, cares for thirty five to 
fifty patients at any given time, according to Mark 
Swidler, a palliative care doctor at YNHH. This 
number is a small fraction of the 1,541 beds available 
at the hospital—which explains where end-of-life 
doulas step in. They do what palliative care doctors 
and hospitals cannot: provide hours and hours of 
constant, undivided care to the dying. 

Part of the reason that palliative care departments 
cannot keep up with demand is that they are underfunded. 
Most patients enrolled in palliative care are above the 
age of 65, so Medicare pays for a large percentage of 
their palliative care costs. According to Health Affairs, 
Medicare’s approach to reimbursement favors medical 
procedures over palliative care procedures. In other 
words, Medicare doesn’t cover palliative care to the 
extent that it does other medical expenses. This disparity 
in reimbursement is visible in doctors’ paycheck gaps. 
In New Haven, general surgeons earn $161,000 more 
per year than palliative care physicians, according 
to Glassdoor. 

Bonafé is a strong proponent of palliative care, but 
recognizes its current limitations. “They’re not given 
a lot of space and resources to function,” she said. She 
wants palliative care physicians to refer patients to her 
doula practice, but she says her meetings with doctors 
at YNHH have been fruitless.

Laura Morrison, a palliative care doctor at YNHH, 
hesitates to refer her patients to doulas because 
health insurance does not cover doula fees. “It’s 
harder to refer when it’s financially out of pocket,” 
said Morrison.

“They just need to know that we are around to help 
them do an even better job,” Bonafé said. “Until they 
understand that, we are not going to be welcome with 
open arms.” 

In December 2018, Bonafé took on a client, a retired 
German professor at Yale whom I’ll refer to as Sara 
for the sake of confidentiality. She was dying from 
cancer and had no living family. During her last four 
weeks, Sara moved into a nearby hospice, and Bonafé 
visited her daily. Beyond advocating for her needs, 
such as readjusting her laxative medication when Sara 
experienced debilitating diarrhea or speaking to the 
front office when a staff member made a rude remark 
(“Well, you’re not going to be here long!”), Bonafé 
made sure that Sara’s experience was as peaceful as 
possible. When Bonafé noticed that a jazz guitarist 
came to play on the weekends, she scheduled a concert 
in Sara’s room. Sara loved jazz. “She was absolutely 
delighted,” Bonafé reminisced, with a wistful smile.

diagnosis. The following day, Bonafé brought a 
bottle of French wine, and they enjoyed a glass together 
in the waning afternoon light. Bonafé recalled that 
Sara said, in a burst of joy, “I don’t remember ever 
having such good wine.”

“She was in heaven,” said Bonafé later. “It brought 
her so much joy. I saw her big smile, and that rush 
of dopamine.” When Sara passed away weeks later, 
Bonafé combed through Sara’s apartment, donating 
furniture and passing important legal documents to 
her attorney. 

Those surrounded by family members can also 
benefit 
from 
working 
with 
doulas. 
Sharon 
McCullough, an end-of-life doula working out of 
Southington, Connecticut, is trained in Clear Light 
Meditation, which helps make the dying process more 
tranquil through bedside meditation. Last year, one 
of McCullough’s clients lived in hospice care for the 
last few days of his life. The client had recently ended 
a series of aggressive treatments that left his family 
in a state of stress and conflict. McCullough decided 
to lead a meditation at his deathbed. “I was able to 
provide peace in a turmoil-filled environment.”

Clients are willing to pay thousands of dollars for 
these services, which include companionship, 
meditation, and the doula’s constant phrases of 
affirmation and comfort. The expanding market for 
end-of-life doulas reveals the gaping hole left by the 
medical system when it comes to death. 

And yet end-of-life doulas face a long road ahead 
before they become a household name. Their 
obscurity arises not just from the fact that the clients 
of death doulas can’t posthumously make referrals, 
but also due to the lack of nationwide standardization. 
While nurses and doctors must pass standardized 
exams in order to earn a license, death doulas aren’t 
licensed. Instead, they may attend one of dozens 
of different training options and take an online 
exam, which costs $115, to earn a proficiency badge 
from the National End-of-Life Doula Alliance. The 
organization’s website stresses that “families can know 
that an end-of-life doula who has earned a NEDA 
Proficiency Badge has met certain standards,” called 
“Core Competencies.” These standards include basic 
values such as professionalism, technical knowledge, 
and communication. The National End-of-Life Doula 
Alliance’s mission is to increase awareness about 
and popularize this profession across the country. 
Currently, not every doula training program or

in Berkeley College.
doula falls under the umbrella of this organization. 
Realistically, the standardization of end-of-life doula 
practices won’t be easy. Each doula has their own 
approach to treatments, whether it’s meditation or 
legal assistance, and a doula’s expertise arises from 
experience and practice in the field, something that 
can’t be evaluated on an exam. 

Additionally, being an end-of-life doula is not a 
full-time job. Five of nine end-of-life doulas in 
Connecticut don’t have a full roster of clients likely 
because most people have not heard of their services. 
“Nobody makes a living being a death doula yet,” 
Bonafé said. Bonafé works as a landlord, Harrison 
pet-sits, and McCullough works in a hospice. Doula 
Jill Bowens works at Quinnipiac University as an 
administrative assistant while starting a private doula 
practice. “The goal is to phase out of my nine-to-five 
and spend the last retirement years of my life as an 
end-of-life doula, doing this work as long as I can,” 
said Bowens. 

For now, Bonafé mentors younger doulas like 
Bowens and makes sure that each visitor to her death 
cafe is received with open arms. Six months ago, at the 
July death cafe, Bonafé noticed a newcomer—Susan 
Clark. Her vibrant red hair and stories made her 
unforgettable to Bonafé, as Clark opened up about 
her sister’s death during discussion. “She was sharing 
in a very beautiful way,” Bonafé recounted. “And then 
magic happened.”

At each subsequent cafe, Bonafé noticed that Clark 
smiled a little more. At the next cafe, Clark brought 
in a framed photograph of Joe, Clark’s sister, taken 
in Hawaii days before her death. Eyes obscured by 
sunglasses, Joe wore a t-shirt emblazoned with turtles, 
a parrot balanced on each shoulder. Joe adored turtles 
and had adopted two from a shelter, Clark told the 
group. At the October death cafe, Clark was the last 
to speak.

“We’re tenacious for life,” Clark said. “We don’t 
want to give it up. It wasn’t in her control. It was her 
time to go. I probably will be fighting with her forever 
for leaving though.” 

As the cafe wrapped up, participants zipped rain 
jackets and returned mugs. People slipped into the 
rainy night, on solitary walks or drives back home, 
just as quickly as they gathered.

If you enter Yale Law School and make a 
left up the stairs, you’ll notice the stained-
glass window portraits—a lawyer with a 
quilled pen, a judge clutching a case, the scales 
of justice—guiding you as you ascend. Rosanna 
Gonsiewski, a senior administrative assistant, 
climbs past those windows to her third-floor office 
every day, but she has yet to reach the promise 
of justice they hold. We meet on a quiet Friday 
afternoon inside her office, which we’re both 
relieved is empty. Her coworker is taking a sick 
day. Gonsiewski, I learn, holds onto those tightly. 
Especially after she used up twelve to satisfy Yale’s 
Health Expectations Program, or HEP.

Gonsiewski spent all of her sick days getting 
colonoscopies—not because her doctor mandated 
them, but because Yale, her employer, forced 
them.

After her fiftieth birthday, Gonsiewski received 
a notification that HEP, a mandatory health 
screening and “coaching” system for many of Yale’s 
unionized employees, was requiring her to get a 
colonoscopy. “Some of this is really disgusting,” 
she warns me. She laughs and puts her hands to 
her face, her brown curly hair bounces in front 
of her eyes. Gonsiewski had been previously 
diagnosed with an irritable bowel, so she knew 
that cleaning out her system for a colonoscopy 
wasn’t going to be an easy process. But if she didn’t 
complete the exam six months after her birthday, 
her paycheck would start to drop $25 a week—a 
cost she couldn’t afford. So she scheduled the 
colonoscopy for a month after her birthday. Then 
the complications began.

At first, she only planned to take three days off 
of work: one day for a clearing of the system before 
the procedure, one day for the colonoscopy, and 
one day for recovery. But during the first procedure 
her prescription medicine counteracted the 
anesthesia, and she was screaming “Ow!” on the 
operating table. They had to redo the procedure. 
Another three days off work. This time, her system 
wasn’t cleared and she would have to do two days 
of prep. Four more days off work. Ten sick days 
used.

Gonsiewski was irritated. After working so hard 
to accumulate her sick days, HEP was eating 
away at them. “This was not something I deemed 
an emergency,” she tells me. If it had been her 
choice, she would have waited to complete the 
colonoscopy during a break. Yet under HEP, the 
medical decision wasn’t hers to make. It was Yale’s. 
And the threat of losing $25 a week, Gonsiewski 
tells me, “instill[ed] so much fear” that she had 
to get the test done. Twenty-five dollars a week 
is $100 a month. One thousand three hundred 
dollars a year. It’s groceries for five weeks in New 
Haven. A month’s rent. Childcare. Money towards 
a mortgage. Part of her daughter’s tuition.

Last spring when Gonsiewski got the flu, she 
was too dizzy and feverish to come to work for 
four days. When she returned, she learned two 
Yale requires many of its unionized employees to 
disclose private medical information and undergo 
“wellness coaching.” Those who refuse have to pay.

of the days she was out sick were going to come 
out of her paycheck. Gonsiewski couldn’t believe 
it. She always left herself a cushion of sick days 
for medical emergencies like this. But after the 
colonoscopies required by HEP, she had none left 
until July 1. With a chronically ill husband and 
daughter in college, Gonsiewski couldn’t afford to 
miss even the days of pay that were already gone. 
She wouldn’t be able to take a sick or vacation day 
between March and July.

Gonsiewski is one of around 5,400 clerical, 
technical, cafeteria, maintenance, and power 
plant workers at Yale, who, belonging to unions 
Local 34 and 35, have been required to enroll in 
Yale’s Health Expectations Program since January 
2017. HEP also applies to those employees’ 
spouses and dependents who use Yale Health or 
Aetna insurance. If employees (and dependents) 
don’t comply or choose to opt out, they suffer a 
fine of $25 per week.

Yale rolled out the workplace wellness program 
of HEP with the hope of keeping employees 
healthy—and also with the hope of reducing 
the money it spends on healthcare. In theory, 
if Yale could identify an employee’s health 
problem early, they could act early and avoid 
serious healthcare costs. Local 34 and 35 provide 
employees with affordable health care plans—
with a $0 premium option if employees elect the 
Yale Health insurance. Yale was threatening to 
increase healthcare costs substantially, so HEP 
was negotiated as an alternative, lower cost option.

But when employees enroll in HEP, they 
are shepherded through a long list of invasive 
screenings and tests, like the colonoscopy 
Gonsiewski underwent. Christine Turcek, a first 
line cook at JE, who had a double mastectomy 
after battling breast cancer, was forced to get 
a mammogram under HEP. Even though she 
medically couldn’t complete the breast exam, she 
was still threatened with the fine. It took repeated 
long explanations to HEP representatives—
which forced her  to relive her experience with 
cancer each time—in order for them to grant 
her an exemption for the test. If an employee 
doesn’t complete HEP’s requirements by a certain 
deadline, the $25 per week pay dock begins. The 
weekly deductions continue for at least three 
months, regardless of whether the requirement is 
fulfilled before that period ends. 

Although it’s not unheard of for companies 
to charge penalties for opting out of wellness 
programs, Yale’s non-compliance fee is among the 
highest in the country, according to the American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), meaning 
HEP is among the nation’s most punitive wellness 
programs.


Jason Schwartz, a locksmith at Yale, refuses to 
comply with HEP on principle. He takes the $25 
a week pay cut, his version of a silent protest. “For 
some people that work at Yale, $25 is a lot more 
money than it is for me,” he tells me when we 
meet at Blue State on Wall Street. Some people in 
his union earn only $16.92 per hour, and it’s often 
harder for them to accept the cut. 

He leans across the table to whisper. “But I had 
to cut down on non-necessities,” he says. He used 
to visit his in-laws in the Philippines every year. 
The trip was something that he always looked 
forward to, but with the pay cut he’s suffered from 
not complying with HEP, he says he can no longer 
afford to go. His wife and daughter will go without 
him this year. 

Schwartz is right: For many of Yale’s lowest-paid 
employees, like Gonsiewski, the choice to opt out 
isn’t financially feasible. That’s why Gonsiewski 
joined leading plaintiff Lisa Kwesell, a part-time 
service assistant at Yale, to sue Yale and to make 
HEP participation voluntary. The plaintiffs assert 
that HEP is “coercive.” 

Under the American Disabilities Act and 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 
employers can collect medical and genetic 
information from their employees only if they 
provide the information voluntarily. Since 
this law was enacted, there have been disputes 
over what “voluntarily” means. In 2016, it 
was deemed that employers could charge 
employees up to 30 percent of their insurance 
premium as a penalty for not participating in 
wellness programs—and still call the program 
“voluntary.” But in 2018, the AARP, which 
is known for fighting for employee rights in 
workplace wellness lawsuits, won a lawsuit that 
got rid of this clause in the law. Nothing was 
left in its place. With no new guidelines, just an 
absence of old ones, the question of what makes 
a program “voluntary” is now entirely up for 
interpretation. Yale declined to comment on 
the case due to the ongoing litigation, but the 
University’s legal stance is that HEP qualifies as 
voluntary. Many required to participate in the 
program disagree. Their legal battle with Yale 
has been proceeding for two years—with no 
clear end in sight.  

HEP’s testing isn’t just problematic for 
those who have experienced certain medical 
conditions. Over-screening can cause “people 
to feel more vulnerable, to be terrorized by 
false alarms, and to be overdiagnosed and 
overtreated,” says Gilbert Welch a professor 
at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of 
Medicine. 

Some employees are particularly concerned 
with how HEP affects the privacy of their 
medical records. HEP is implemented not 
through Yale, but through a third-party 
company known as a wellness vendor, called 
HealthMine. Gonsiewski was shocked to learn 
she had to send her private information to a 
company she had never heard of. She had no 
idea a different company was administering the 
program until she received the link to register.

HealthMine gathers HEP members’ test 
results and insurance claims and sorts through 
the data. The company flags employees with 
high weight or blood pressure, diabetes or 
heart disease. It gathers their health records. 
And it reveals their information to yet another 
third-party company, TrestleTree. TrestleTree 
then connects the employees with mandatory 
health wellness coaches—nurses or dieticians 
who focus on providing strategies for managing 
stress and weight. 

Yale calls TrestleTree a “health transformation 
organization” on the HEP website. But 
TrestleTree is not a covered entity under the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act, or HIPAA, a law that protects patients’ 
privacy. When enrolling in HEP, employees 
sign a contract that states, “I also understand that 
information disclosed under this authorization 
may no longer be subject to the HIPAA privacy 
rules.” Yale employee’s health information 
is then accessible to TrestleTree—and to the 
organization’s wellness coaches. 

Yale claims that these health care coaches 
are “highly trained.” In fact, the only training 
required of TrestleTree coaches is a three-
week program in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Yet 
these coaches are supposed to provide in-depth 
health counseling sessions, much longer and 
more intimate than one might have even with 
their own doctor.

In flyers sent to employee homes, Yale writes 
that TrestleTree’s health care coaches will “be 
a trusted guide and advisor for you and your 
health.” What Yale doesn’t say is that the health 
care coaches might pester you with phone calls 
until you complete a mandatory three-hour 
session with them. They might send you a tape 
Noah felt like his 
coach was in his face 
even through the 
phone: “When did you 
weigh yourself this 
week? How much did 
you weigh?”

measure in the mail if you’re overweight, as 
they did to plaintiff Mary Brassil. Or call and 
email multiple times a day, until you answer, 
as they did to Noah, a law enforcement official 
and a spouse of a Yale employee. 

Noah, whose name has been changed in this 
story to protect his privacy, has a hard time 
talking about TrestleTree without raising his 
voice. “I’m a private person,” he  said, “so right 
off the bat, the concept of talking to someone 
on the telephone who I’ve never met, who’s not 
a doctor, who’s not my doctor, who’s really not 
a stakeholder in my health felt totally invasive, 
over the top, and unnecessary.” Noah was 
recently hospitalized after Sudafed mixed badly 
with the diuretic pills he takes for his blood 
pressure. After this incident, HEP required him 
to see a health coach. Noah had sorted out what 
went wrong with his doctor, and he was soon 
feeling well again. 

Yet when Noah was released from the 
hospital, he still had to meet with a TrestleTree 
health coach. “Right off the bat, a gun was put 
to my head,” he tells me. The coach called him 
at work, and when he didn’t pick up, she would 
call again. And then email him. And email 
again. He explains that the whole experience 
was “invasive, condescending and bordering on 
harassment.” 

Noah felt like his coach was in his face even 
through the phone: “When did you weigh 
yourself this week? How much did you weigh?” 
He received calls multiple times throughout 
his work day and would have to complete his 
sessions during his free time. His coach, he 
said, obviously seemed to be reading from a 
script. Even though he explained to her he had 
to do one hundred sit-ups and one hundred 
push-ups a day for law enforcement training, 
she kept calling him to ask if he completed 
the core workout she recommended. Then she 
would email him the link to it. Again.

For a company that seems to have so much 
information about its clients, Trestletree 
publicizes very little information about itself. 
None of the Yale employees I spoke to could 
tell me the name of their assigned coach, how 
the company got their health information, 
where TrestleTree is located. 

I decided to investigate. Next door to Yale 
Human Resources on 221 Whitney is a brick 
building with what looks like an abandoned 
construction 
project 
blocking 
the 
front 
entrance. 205 Whitney Avenue. The sign in 
front advertises a construction company, Yale’s 
Women Faculty Forum, a nonprofit. There’s no 
mention of TrestleTree.

If you walk inside and turn left at the stairs, 
there’s a printed paper sign leaning against the 
wall, reading “TrestleTree Health Coaching 
(Office on the 2nd floor).” I take a picture. 
My first proof that the company’s real. I walk 
upstairs and the office seems abandoned. Each 
room has a scale. There’s a BMI chart. It seems 
more like a weight loss coach’s office than a 
health one.

A woman with a short blonde haircut, one of 
the coaches, is in her office. She tells me she 
really can’t say anything when I approach her. 
She seems nervous. She stands up immediately 
when I introduce myself and starts to usher 
me out. She tells me everything said has to 
be approved by her manager. I keep pressing 
but I’m met by silence. She brings me to her 
manager, a slightly younger woman with a 
similar blonde short haircut, and they share 
a look of rolled eyes and tight smiles before 
looking towards me. I can tell their lips are 
going to stay pressed together. I’m directed to 
check out the National Board for Health and 
Wellness Coaching for any more information. I 
leave carrying a post-it note with the URL. 

Barbara, an employee at Yale who requested 
that her name be changed in this article due 
to a fear of retribution, was flagged as someone 
who needed coaching, she suspects, because of 
her clinical anxiety. But her whole experience 
with the coaches, she tells me, stressed her

out more. “I’m so pissed off honey, I can’t even 
tell you,” she’s smiling, and she says this through 
her teeth. We’re sitting so close together that I 
can feel her breath on my face. She tells me she 
has bronchitis, a polite warning I suppose, and 
I try to subtly shift away without offending. But, 
really, I’m not that worried. As a student at Yale, 
my healthcare is simple. Yes, sometimes the walk 
to Yale Health is cold and long, and sometimes 
there’s a wait. But beyond that, I never really 
worry that much when I feel sick. I just go to the 
clinic. I lean back in, deciding, slightly guiltily, 
that hearing her was worth the risk of sickness.

Barbara whispers, “You have to be careful here.” 
Her eyes are wide as they scan the room. Blue 
State on York Street is brimming with students—
finishing their morning Hindi homework, eating 
a croissant after morning lift, trying to fit a 
Constitutional Law textbook and coffee on the 
small table. There’s no maintenance staff in the 
cafe. Or technical staff. Or clerks. No Union 34 
or 35 workers. Nobody here would quite know 
what we’re talking about. But Barbara already 
feels targeted, surveilled, and she’s worried. So, 
we whisper.

“It’s such an intrusion,” she says of her coaching 
experience. “I said to [the coach] ‘Do you want 
know about my bills at home too? My mortgage?’ 
Seriously.” Barbara said she would rather give the 
health coach her financial information than her 
health history. “Medical records are so personal.”

A few minutes after Barbara leaves our interview, 
she returns and sits down next to me again, a 
little flushed from the cold, a little flustered by 
her thoughts. She’s speaking quickly and louder. 
“I just want to let you know I’m not against this 
university. I’m grateful for my job.” I assure her I 
understand. She pauses for a moment. “There’s 
just some bad stuff that goes on here,” she says.

Congrats! You’ve reached the end of our February issue—the last issue ever to be produced by The New 
Journal’s 2019-2020 Editorial Board. It has been a wild and wonderful year of friendship, carbs, and thir­
ty-six hour production weekends. To close out our last magazine, we collected some of our favorite lines 
from the previous four issues we worked on and presented them below, now totally out of context. Enjoy!
No one even noticed the explosion. “All the students slept 
through the night with a smile on their face.”

“Yale clientele are not necessarily dying; they’re 
not necessarily from here; and they come here very 
temporarily.”

When I asked Becky if her llamas are sexually frustrated, 
she hesitated—not because they do not encounter any 
difficulty but because I had misnamed her alpacas as 
llamas for the fifth time.

“I don’t think I’m the best person [to be mayor]. Barack 
Obama would be better than me,” he said solemnly.

I don’t have the nostalgia, the tinkering mindset, or the 
self-confidence required to go around telling people you 
collect decapitated snowmen, Supermen, and Rutherford 
B. Hayeses.

“Throwing away books is a very important thing,” he tells 
me.

Elicker wore his signature cornflower-blue shirt and held 
a Klean Kanteen gingerly with both hands as we spoke.

Wars brought shortages, and at times, the students found 
the food so unbearable that they threw the boiled beef on 
the floor and the rancid butter out the windows. 

I prayed that the Shiru Cafe Bot wouldn’t find out.

“I’m sure that men are attacked too,” she said.

The Yale truck parks in Quantum’s reception bay and 
empties the day’s load into a murky brown pool that the 
company’s vice president Brian Paganini calls a “really 
gross milkshake.”

A sign hung above the pen: You can’t buy happiness, but 
you can buy an ALPACA, and that’s kind of the same 
thing.

Ip remarked that certifying to be a drone pilot is “like 
going to the DMV.”

I’m here for journalistic investigation, I reminded myself 
as the tour finally began. I did NOT sign up through 
Match.com.

“Lean into it,” he said. “It’s supposed to feel like a washing 
machine.”

By some bizarre alchemy, a car ride through a “long 
tunnel” during that trip inspired Kakimoto to conceive of 
a coffee shop that, instead of making a profit by selling 
coffee, would gather data from students and sell it to 
companies looking to recruit them.

As he was getting out of a silver Buick, I recognized his 
bearded face and shouted, “Doug!” 

Burton reflects that unlike in Hadley, where his store is 
surrounded mostly by fields and cows, in New Haven 
“there’s some quirky people walking the street. It’s been 
fun.” 

Pings are comforting; gurgling is not a good sign. 

As more participants arrived, it became clear that the 
ghost tours are typically a couples, or perhaps aspiring 
couples, event. 

A little girl with a ponytail trailed curiously behind her 
teacher, hoping he would make the small blue robot move 
again.

Briefcase in hand, he halted his beeline towards the 
municipal building at 200 Orange Street and turned to 
face me.

My Toblerone bar had arrived; the drone flew away, 
arching over a line of buildings until it vanished from 
view.

“Racism, classism, elitism. Nah.”

A blended reality utopia? Perhaps.
