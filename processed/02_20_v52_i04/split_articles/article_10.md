In an office down the hall, the call center’s 
clamor is inaudible. Sunlight streams in from a wide 
window overlooking Route 34. The employees to 
whom I talk range from recent hires to old hands; 
all of them have no shortage of war stories. David 
Mancini, a jovial dispatcher with some top teeth 
missing, recounts a running gun battle that affected 
three neighborhoods and the highway. Debbie 
Thornton, the two-phoning supervisor, was the 
dispatcher for the 2002 drug operation in the Hill 
neighborhood during which Officer Robert Fumiatti 
was shot in the face. “He died three times on the 
way to the hospital,” she tells me. Fumiatti survived 
five more years before suffering a fatal heart attack, 
likely tied to that earlier injury. Another operator 
offers the story of a wife trying to save her overdosed 
husband. For Sheila Villegas, a call-taker of five 
years, the hardest calls are those in which children 
call for their parents or  a child is in distress. “I have 
a ten-year-old at home, so those are always touchy,” 
Villegas said. 


These cases, terrible as they sound, are the 
exception in that the operators eventually learned 
how they turned out. Much of the time, Peet says, 
the trauma of a call does not resolve itself. “Call 
takers talk to people in all types of emergencies, from 
childbirth to stabbings to shootings to houses on fire 
to people trapped to people having their own mental 
issues. We’ve talked people off of bridges—all these 
sorts of things. There’s no closure.”


Yet other factors compound the inherent stresses 
of the job. Work policies, for one, are seen by all 
involved as archaic and often draconic. Peet notes 
that employees sometimes get schedules with 
inconvenient days off, and that many policies are 
driven only by seniority. As a result, it can take years 
as a call-taker before the job starts to pay dividends. 
Benefits, too, are scant. Thornton, a twenty-three-
year veteran of the call center, worked a second 
job at Home Depot until 2018 to support her two 
children as a single mom. In her opinion, daycare 
accommodations, or similar employee support, 
would have made a major difference. 


Mancini, his chair propped up beside a desktop 
Bill Murray sticker, explains that many operators quit 
as a result of the high stakes nature of call-taking. 
“We work in a mistake-free environment. What you 
do—on the phone and the information that the 
call-taker takes, and how the dispatcher dispatches 
it, and how the supervisor’s listening to make sure 
everything goes smoothly—is the difference between 
life and death.” 


He looks at me intently for a moment, then leans 
forward. “Regrets, bro. You don’t want those. That’s 
why whether you just got married or you just won 
powerball and you’re having the best day of your 
life, or she just broke up with you and she’s going 
out with your brother and everything else and life’s 
miserable—you got to deliver.” He gives me a rueful, 
gap-toothed grin.


Peet also sees a lack of public awareness about 
the difficulty of call-taking as another factor 
exacerbating employee turnover. “We kind of get left 
out of the picture an awful lot,” he says. I ask about 
the 911 SAVES Act, introduced last August in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, which would aim to 
bring more prestige and better pay to the profession 
by changing its classification from clerical work to 
protective services. When I mention the Act, Peet 
can’t help but beam. “That would be like ‘God hear 
my prayer’ being answered,” he says with a laugh. 
“Just the fact that [dispatchers] would be seriously 
considered as part of the public safety process. Like 
anything, people want someone to say ‘you do a good 
job.’ It takes a very humble person to do what they do 
and to not get the recognition for it.”


How do call-takers and dispatchers maintain their 
mental health day in and day out, faced as they are 
with the sometimes jarring sequence of calls from 
non-emergencies, such as noise complaints, to calls 
about fires, overdoses, murders, and the like? One 
answer may be institutional support. “The city and 
the department offer EAP, Employee Assistance 
Programs. We’re constantly watching people for signs 
of stress,” Peet maintains. When asked about NHPD 
Chief Otoniel Reyes’s suggestion of mandatory 
mental health check-ins for police officers, he says 
it’s a procedure his department would also be in 
favor of adopting.


Even so, many employees at the call center are 
skeptical of the current mental health infrastructure’s 
efficacy. “Most people are hesitant in utilizing EAP 
because there’s a stigma to it,” says Mancini, rubbing 
his chin. 


Villegas is of a similar mind. “I think partly some 
of the employees don’t feel comfortable admitting 
they need some type of help for their stress levels. I 
think sometimes they may feel weak, or they don’t 
want others to know they’re suffering from some sort 
of PTSD or from certain calls.” Yet the system also 
needs work, not simply the mindset of call-takers. “I 
think that in our department, they just expect you to 
get over it, in a sense,” Villegas notes. “With all first 
responders, I don’t think they make mental health a 
first priority.”


Where institutional tools fall short, personal 
coping mechanisms pick up the slack. Each operator 
has their own tried and true way of destressing. For 
Mancini, this involves “cats, guns, motorcycles, 
martial arts” and his girlfriend, who is reportedly 
“lovely.” Thornton, who recently moved to a farm 
with geese and ducks not far from New Haven, 
relies on baking and smooth jazz for relaxation. Teri 
Nelson Durant, a veteran dispatcher who previously 
worked at a post office, has a ritual of praying every 
morning on the way to work. At home, she takes her 
mind off of work by spending time with her fifteen 
kids. “Grasping them outside of here is what helps 
keep sane,” she says. “It keeps me busy.”


As for Villegas? “Honestly, my therapy is my 
dog,” she says softly, with a tentative smile. “After 
a rough day at work I go home, and he’s there, 
and he’s just so happy to see me—just coming 
home to him and my son, just trying to forget 
about what I went through during that shift.” She
