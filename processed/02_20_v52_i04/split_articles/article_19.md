In Connecticut, death doulas aim 
to ease the transition to the other side.

Susan Clark, age 5, would shiver in her bed. The 
heat never reached the room on the top floor that 
she shared with four siblings. In the middle of the 
night, she braved the stairs in the darkness to use 
her eldest sister’s bathroom on the floor below. It 
was that, or peeing in a bucket. 

That year, her 2-year-old sister died. “She just 
disappeared,” Clark, whose name has been changed 
in this story to protect her privacy, said sixty years 
later. “My parents never talked about it. She was just 
gone, gobbled up in the night.”
Clark never found out what happened to her 
sister, only that her parents didn’t have enough 
money to pay for a doctor. Later in the year, she 
started school in Valley Stream, New York, and 
discovered a funeral home across the street. During 
recess each day, redheaded Clark crossed the street 
and entered the facility. The managers let her into 
the home, where she ambled through a room full of 
open caskets. “I’d go in and look at the people, and 
collect all the little memorial cards,” Clark said. 
Death once again touched her life decades later, 
in February 2019, when her youngest sister Joe 
died of a fentanyl overdose at age 56. She left no 
will, only a scribbled note for Clark that mentioned 
that she wanted to be cremated. That’s when the 
chaos began. 

The rest of Clark’s family was Catholic, and 
demanded embalmment and a burial. Yet after Joe’s 
autopsy, Clark couldn’t stand thinking about how 
uncomfortable her sister would’ve felt with the 
embalming process. “I was extremely embarrassed, 
because of how private she was.”
As Clark lived closest to Joe’s home in Hamden, 
she exercised the legal authority to cremate her 
sister. “I rushed to everyone’s hate list. My eldest 
sister threatened to sue me. Now no one speaks to 
me. I lost Joe, I lost the whole family.”
Clark believes that her family’s inability to discuss 
death led to the division between her and her 
siblings. But Clark wants to be different from her 
family. After stumbling upon a New York Times 
article about death cafes—monthly meetings for 
people to chat about death over cakes and tea—she 
decided to venture to her first one in late July 2019 
at Koffee?, a cafe in New Haven. She’s only missed 
one session ever since. These nighttime meetings 
provided Clark a space to talk about her sister again, 
to share with others the lonely journey she’d been 
on ever since Joe’s death. It was her doorway into the 
death positivity movement, which has been slowly 
altering how people approach death and dying across 
the country.

Two nights before Halloween, Nathalie Bonafé, 
with her gray pixie cut and a scarf knotted around 
her neck, commenced the tenth death cafe of the 
year by inviting attendees to introduce themselves. 
A newcomer named Amber, dressed in a pea green 
cardigan, went first. “I’m here because I’m 63 years old 
and childless.” With no children to care for her and 
her husband in their old age, she said, she worried 
about dying alone.

A tray of vanilla scones and chocolate chip muffins, 
sugary crust glistening in the reddish lamp light, 
passed from hand to hand. Bonafé, the moderator 
of the discussion, broke eye contact with Amber to 
place a scone on a napkin. Dripping rain jackets hung 
from the backs of chairs in the cafe. Of the twenty 
people who had gathered, some were past middle age 
and worried about the future. Others were doctors or 
hospice care workers. Four, including Bonafé, were 
death, or end-of-life, doulas, non-medically trained 
people who are hired to help those approaching the 
end of their lives. The rest were just curious. Amber, 
perched on a stool, passed the tray of desserts to Mo, 
an energy healer (whose name has been changed 
in this story to protect her privacy), with large eyes 
magnified by thick rectangular glasses. Across from 
Mo sat a young woman sporting devil horns and a 
young man dressed as the Joker. Behind the couple 
sat a young botanist and a middle-aged man with 
wooden beads around his neck. 

As the introductions finished, Bonafé cleared her 
throat. “Thank you all for sharing,” she said. “I want to 
reiterate that we’re here to be human together. We’re 
here to embrace our humanity.”
Stories tumbled from participants’ mouths, as the 
warm lamp lighting and the scent of coffee grounds 
weakened inhibitions. Another death doula with 
curly bangs covering her forehead spoke about a 
client, a terminally ill 49-year-old Ghanaian woman 
with a husband and numerous teenage boys. “Why 
her? Why not me?” she asked. 	

In response, a middle-aged man shared that his 
daughter is non-verbally autistic. After spending years 
questioning “why me,” he decided upon a new world 
view. “I believe in a deterministic world,” he mused. 
“We’re living in this beautiful machine.” He 

had surrendered control over what happened in his 
life, and tried to live in peace with his circumstances. 
Bonafé, delighted, sipped her coffee. “I’m going to 
have to smoke a cigarette after this because I’m on 
such a dopamine high. Just being present here with 
all of you—it’s beautiful.”

The death positivity movement aims to destigmatize 
death and transform it from the terrifying to the 
peaceful. From death cafes to end-of-life doulas, the 
movement supports those who feel sidelined by the 
medical system. 

In some ways, “death positivity” is a return to the 
way people used to relate to death. According to 
Stephen Latham, a bioethics and political science 
professor at Yale, death was not a taboo subject 
before the medical advancements of the twentieth 
century. Prior to the invention of antibiotics in the 
years following World War II, simple infections killed 
people, sometimes within hours. “There was almost 
nothing that medicine could do to stave off death,” 
said Latham. The inefficacy of early medicine against 
disease made death a less predictable, pervasive force 
in communities. The stigmatization of death, according 
to Latham, is more of a modern phenomenon.

In 1953, the polio vaccine was invented. A year 
later, the first successful organ transplant occurred. 
Two years after that, metastatic cancer was treated 
successfully for the first time. By the 1970s, doctors 
became skilled enough to keep terminally ill patients 
alive, making death a long, drawn-out process. 
“Medicine got good enough to be burdensome,” 
Latham said, or powerful enough to maintain 
patient’s lives at the expense of a good quality of 
life. Death moved from home to hospital, causing 
people to spend their final days secured on a gurney 
surrounded by masked doctors, attached to tubes and 
blinking machines. According to a 2016 study, 72 
percent of Americans die in hospitals. 

As more people died under fluorescent lights in 
hospitals, death became removed from everyday life. 
The death positivity movement, said Latham, is an 
attempt to oppose that change, “to make death more 
calm, more beautiful, more anticipated,” something 
that can be normalized and embraced.

There are nine end-of-life doulas registered in 
Connecticut with the National End-of-Life Doula 
Alliance, which includes 288 doulas nationwide. 
From advocating for their clients’ needs in hospice 
care centers and arranging financial plans to making 
cups of tea and having deep conversations, doulas 
bring guidance to those who confront the medical 
system in the weeks before death. 

When Bonafé, owner of a private death doula 
practice called A Gentler Parting, takes on a client, 
she never knows how she will end up assisting them. 
If the client asks for a shaman, lawyer, or financial 
consultant, she finds one. If the client is in pain, 
Bonafé consults nurses to readjust pain medication. 
If the client’s family members are in distress, she talks 
them through any fears they may have. The crux of the 
job, according to Bonafé, is being a loving presence. 
“They just want the company,” explained Bonafé. “We 
let them be in this circle of love.” 

Bonafé’s fees depend on a client’s needs. She charges 
$500 for two to three preliminary meetings, which 
last around six hours each. She meets with the client’s 
family and combs through legal documents, such 
as wills and advanced healthcare initiatives, which 
outline a patient’s end-of-life medical wishes. In total, 
most clients end up paying between $2,000 and $6,000 
for a doula’s services. “Once people understand what 
I bring to the table, they have no problems with my 
fees,” she wrote. “I can help them save aggravation and 
money overall by helping them think rationally instead 
of out of fear.”

Despite increased media coverage in The New York 
Times and Wall Street Journal, end-of-life doulas are 
still relatively unknown. When Bonafé attends dinner 
parties and describes her job to people she’s just met, 
they often respond with shock and confusion. Many 
people do not learn about these services, or understand 
them, until it’s too late.

Chanel Reynolds was one of those people. In 2009, 
Reynolds received a phone call that changed her life. 
Her husband José, 32, had been struck by a vehicle 
while biking. Reynolds spent the next week in the 
ICU, torn not only by the possible loss of her young 
husband, but by the logistics of death: she and José 
weren’t prepared to die. After the first forty-eight 
hours at the hospital, the doctors told Reynolds that 
José would never recover. They inundated Reynolds 
with questions: did they have disability insurance? Did 
José write a legal will? Did he have an advanced care 
directive? Would he want her to pull life support? 
Reynolds’ most pressing thought was: what would
