On the first Monday of November last 
year, Americans’ mail slots were unusually 
stuffed with promises. Political hopefuls 
grinned at constituents and flooded inboxes and 
voicemails with last-minute Can-I-Count-On-Your-
Votes. Across New Haven, a divisive mayoral race 
huffed its last bitter breaths in the eighteen hours before 
election day. For a moment, the frenzy found its way 
to an uncontested aldermanic race in New Haven’s 
twentieth ward, as Delphine Clyburn wedged flyers 
behind doorknobs on the block just around the corner 
from her Newhall Street house. 

Clyburn was running unopposed for her fifth two-
year term as alder of New Haven’s Ward 20, which spans 
much of Newhallville, a neighborhood at the northern 
border of the city with a majority-Black and low-income 
population. Clyburn had an hour and a half to canvass 
before she needed to leave for her 2 p.m. work shift at 
a state-run group home for adults with developmental 
disabilities. In New Haven, alders receive a stipend 
of $2,000 a year; most have to work full time jobs in 
addition to their political responsibilities. 

The majority of the block’s residents were at work, 
so she slipped flyers through mail slots and slid them 
between door hinges. Her silver hair was clipped back 
in a characteristic bun, aside from an orderly wisp 
that swept across her forehead. Occasionally, Clyburn 
stopped to greet pedestrians with a hug before checking 
whether she would see them at the polls the next day. 

On the day before the election, in a ward with over 
four thousand residents, Clyburn handed out only 
about two dozen flyers. She had chosen the particular 
block not because it would be politically strategic, but 
because 89-year-old Ella Anderson lived there, and 
Clyburn wanted to pay her a visit. 

When Clyburn knocked, Anderson (whose name 
has been changed in this story to protect her privacy) 
answered the door in a flamingo-colored nightgown, 
wearing curlers in her hair. Anderson ushered us inside 
and dragged out chairs for us at a dining room table 
covered in a red plastic tablecloth. Small heaps of mail 
rested on the table before us.

Anderson brought out materials she would need 
to renew proof of her eligibility for Connecticut’s 
Energy Assistance Program, which helps low-income 
households pay for heat in the winter, by filling out 
forms for a local non-profit called the Community 
Action Agency of New Haven. Clyburn was putting 
the pre-election rush on hold that morning to help 
Anderson reapply for the government benefit that 
would keep her house warm.

For another politician, the visit to Anderson might 
have been an unusual detour. But Clyburn treated it as 
just another part of her job. On and off election season, 
Clyburn frequently goes “on the doors” both to visit 
with and advocate for her constituents. Local activists 
attest that since Clyburn took office in 2012, the change 
has been palpable in Newhallville. Her ward is slowly 
becoming a neighborhood city officials can no longer 
ignore.

For most of her childhood, Clyburn was whisked 
from home to home, for reasons that often only made 
sense to her in retrospect. Her parents died in separate 
car accidents—her father first, and then her mother. 
She knows that she was 3 years old at the time of her 
mother’s death because at age thirteen, she found a 
newspaper clipping about the crash in a Connecticut 
public library. Soon after the accident that killed their 
mother, Clyburn and her older sister found themselves 
under their great aunt’s care in North Carolina.

“She made sure everything was clean,” Clyburn 
recalled of her great aunt. (Since then, Clyburn has 
kept her living spaces immaculate; her kids used to call 
their home “the museum.”) But Clyburn said that if she 
so much as misspelled a word in her homework, her 
great aunt would beat her. Her great aunt also implored 
them not to trust anyone: “You don’t depend on nobody,” 
Clyburn remembers her saying.

In that house, Clyburn grew up playing baseball and 
kickball, skating and riding bikes. She would cut out 
her own paper dolls and build paper houses for them, 
with paper furniture. But when her grandfather came 
to visit during the summers, Clyburn recalls that he 
noticed her aunt’s abuse and arranged for her to move 
to another aunt’s home in Bridgeport, Connecticut. 

In Bridgeport, Clyburn found herself living with four 
younger kids she had never met.

That aunt made a habit of disappearing, according to 
Clyburn; some weeks, she would leave the house Friday 
and come back Monday. In her absence, Clyburn, who 
was 13 at the time, said she took care of the four younger 
children also living in the house. “I was practically like 
the mom around the house,” Clyburn said. “I knew 
how to run a house, keep it clean.” 

One day, when her aunt was absent, she decided to 
make hot chocolate for the other children in the house. 
She boiled water on the stove, and the water spilled 
onto one of the other kids—she doesn’t remember 
how—burning one girl badly enough that she had to 
go to the doctor. After a year with the aunt who was so 
often gone, Clyburn wound up in her first foster home.

Clyburn’s first set of parents assigned through the 
foster system had always wanted a daughter. The 
Watsons were an elderly couple with no other children, 
and Clyburn felt loved there. But one day, Clyburn 
found herself reassigned to a new foster family, where 
eight other kids—including one of Clyburn’s biological 
brothers she didn’t know she had—resided. 

Clyburn recalls that one of the other foster children 
living in her new home could not hear or speak. The 
girl soon wrote Clyburn a letter saying that the father of 
the house “touched her,” as Clyburn recalls it. Clyburn 
was 15 and scared; she had been scared of the father 
even before receiving the letter. Unsure of what to do, 
she initially kept the letter to herself, and prayed by a 
stream of water outside the house each night: Lord, help 
me get out of this house. Help me. Help me.

Soon, her foster sister “began to show,” Clyburn said. 
In the letter, the girl had only confided that the father 
“touched” her. But the truth revealed itself in the form 
of a fetus. As a ward of the state, according to Clyburn, 
the girl gave birth and was forced to relinquish her 
baby. The whole family had to go to court. Clyburn 
said she brought the letter with her and testified against 
her foster father. Each child was relocated to a different 
house.



A triangular patch of grass two blocks away from 
Anderson’s home, where Starr Street intersects with 
Shelton Avenue, was once called the “Mudhole” — the 
center of New Haven’s drug trade. In the nineties, a pair 
of articles in the New Yorker explored gang dynamics at 
the Mudhole as a case study of urban decay in an era of 
deindustrialization. At the time, the gradual shutdown 
of Newhallville’s primary employer, the Winchester 
Arms Factory, spiked unemployment rates in the area. 
The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, notorious for its 
racist policies, had redlined Newhallville decades earlier, 
marking it a “definitely declining” neighborhood and 
paving the way for institutional discrimination against 
its residents. In media portrayals, a reputation for crime 
and poverty followed Newhallville for decades. In 2013, 
the Yale Daily News described the neighborhood as 
“among the poorest and most dangerous parts of the 
city,” claiming that it was “still not a safe place to walk 
late at night.” 

Local activists were committed to advocating for 
more opportunities and resources for Newhallville. In 
2010, residents organized in response to a controversial 
plan to convert the former Winchester Arms Factory 
into a mixed-use building that would house, in part, a 
tech company focused on financial aid reimbursement. 
The activists held weekly meetings on Mondays in a 
prominent New Haven church. They demanded that 
the developer employ more Newhallville residents for 
the construction of the building. 

Clyburn heard about the meetings and decided to 
show up to one of them—and then another, and another. 
She had been involved in labor organizing for decades; 
since 1987, she had served as a delegate for the statewide 
1199 Healthcare Workers’ Union, representing colleagues 
across Connecticut in disputes with management. She 
even volunteered at one meeting to invite then-Mayor 
John DeStefano to her home to press him about the new 
development. When they met, Clyburn felt that DeStefano 
didn’t sufficiently address her concerns about local hiring. 
After their conversation, she sent him a thank-you note 
asking “why he didn’t care for every part of his city.” 

At one of the meetings, Clyburn met another 
Newhallville neighbor, Shirley Lawrence, who was 
then a lead organizer for a union-affiliated non-profit, 
Connecticut Center for a New Economy. 

“She stood up and asked probably the most important 
questions in the room,” Lawrence said of Clyburn. “I was 
looking at her like, whoa, O.K., this is a pretty strong lady 
here.”

Lawrence’s job involved identifying and mentoring 
community leaders. After the meeting, she met 
separately with Clyburn to urge her to run for alder 
of Ward 20. At the time, Lawerence said, people in 
Newhallville tended to distrust politicians; she felt that 
her neighbors were ready for a change. Clyburn agreed 
to run in 2011 and picked Lawrence as her campaign 
manager. After the Democratic primary, the New Haven 
Independent reported that Clyburn, who was new to 
politics, defeated the incumbent alder, Charles Blango, 
with a decisive 58 percent of the vote.

How did she pull it off? “She probably knocked on 
every door in the neighborhood,” Lawrence said. “And 
she still does it to this day.”


At her third and final foster home, Clyburn did not 
have to worry about a predatory caregiver. But she didn’t 
breathe more easily, at least not at first. Eight other kids 
lived with the Coversons at the time, and three more 
would eventually arrive. Each day, the father would 
bring the kids candy bars after work. Still, Clyburn 
remained guarded. “Trust no one,” she recalls thinking. 
When she came home from school each afternoon, she 
would immediately retreat to her room. Her new foster 
mother expressed love for her anyway, promising that 
she would be there whenever Clyburn could trust her.

Once, when Clyburn was still a teenager, Mrs. 
Coverson told her that she wanted to adopt her. She 
wanted to give Clyburn their family’s name. But by that 
time, Clyburn was engaged. She told Mrs. Coverson to 
adopt the younger foster children in the house instead. 
“I had that thing in me—do for yourself, make your 
own way,” Clyburn said. “That’s from my aunt. That 
stayed with me.”

Clyburn met her husband, Michael, through the 
Coversons’ Bridgeport church, which was affiliated 
with his North Carolina congregation. “We dated over the 
phone and through the mail,” she said. They met three 
times in person before they got married. Clyburn was 19. 
The Coversons were reluctant to support the marriage; 
a part of them wanted Clyburn, and all her siblings, to 
remain in the house forever. But the Coversons worked 
with Clyburn’s high school friends to put together their 
wedding. 

Forty-one years later, Clyburn and her husband are still 
together. They moved to New Haven in 1986, buying the 
Newhallville house they still live in. The couple hashave 
started multiple churches, and currently run Grace and 
Peace Cathedral International on Starr Street. In the 
backyard of their home, greenery flows amidst stone 
statues. Occasionally, the neighbor’s cat wanders through 
the yard, around the house, out to the sidewalk. Blue-and-
white birdhouses adorn trees. Wind chimes sing on the 
back porch. 


The most anger I’ve ever heard in Clyburn’s voice 
came out as she scrolled through her phone to show me 
a photograph of a demolition site in the neighborhood. 
In the image, which she’d captured the other day, a pile 
of bricks and debris lay outside a crumbling building. 
Clyburn said she had asked the site’s manager to throw the 
wreckage into a dumpster, but the manager said that the 
dumpster would overflow. “So. What?,” Clyburn flared. 
“Get the dumpster.”

We sat on green plastic chairs inside the Orchid Cafe 
on Winchester Avenue. On Clyburn’s cell phone camera 
roll, photographs of her newborn grandson interrupted a 
stream of images of sidewalk cracks and untrimmed trees. 
“I ride around this city,” she said. “I ride around this city 
[in my car] to see how every neighborhood is faring.” 
She sees a disparity in the way many city employees 
treat constituents in different neighborhoods; she has a 
particular grudge against the Trees department, which 
she claims doesn’t adequately trim the trees in her ward. 
Construction sites in the city’s wealthier neighborhoods 
don’t look like the one in the image she has just shown me, 
she said. She’s concerned about contaminated materials 
that could spread through the debris. But for Clyburn, 
developers’ lack of dumpsters is about more than just the 
health risk. “They don’t even respect us.” 

Soon after she got elected, Clyburn set out to fill the 
lapses in the city’s care for Newhallville from the ground 
up. She enlisted someone on every street to report back to 
her about each block’s condition. These neighbors would 
inform her about poor property upkeep, whether someone 
was sick, whether someone had passed away. Neighbors 
have also told her about suspected drug deals occurring
