Fire Chief John Alston argues that much of the 
solution has to do with simply providing people with 
the information they need to seek treatment. “We 
knew we wouldn’t be able to just arrest or legislate 
our way out of this problem,” he says. Alston believes 
the card program has been successful at directing 
people towards seeking treatment. “Eighty-three 
percent of the calls we get at the Fire Department 
are medical, and a significant number of those are 
going to be drug related,” he says. “If we believe that 
to be the case, we either give someone a card or we 
place it on their person so they find it later. We’ve 
had treatment centers reporting that lots of people 
are coming in seeking treatment because they found 
the information on these cards.” 

Mayor Justin Elicker, who was inaugurated in 
January, supports the emergency responders’ 
emphasis on treatment rather than policing. “City 
Hall’s philosophy on how to address substance use 
disorder is about not criminalizing drug use but 
treating it as a medical issue,” he says. “Nonprofits 
in the city like the APT Foundation treat people 
regardless of whether they’re currently using or not. 
Research shows that you’ll get better results that 
way.” (The APT Foundation is a treatment center in 
New Haven that offers a range of services, including 
several methadone clinics in the area.) 

Mayor Elicker does note, though, that police 
presence on the Green has increased since the K2 
overdose. Phil Costello has noticed this in his work as 
well. “There are a lot of people trying to help out,” he 
says. “But has the increased police presence changed 
the drug issue? Probably not. Police presence is a 
band-aid, not a solution to the problem.”

Former Mayor Harp also created a task force with 
representatives from law enforcement, City Hall, 
treatment centers, non-governmental organizations, 
the Green’s Committee of Proprietors, the churches 
on the Green, and local residents. According to 
Costello, who was involved with the task force, the 
most important thing to come out of the group’s 
work was a proposed plan for a drop-in center and 
clinic near the Green, where people struggling with 
addiction could get treatment. Costello believes 
that establishing such a center would be a critical 
step towards addressing the problems of substance 
use disorder in New Haven. In Vancouver, he said, 
opioid treatment centers that feature supervised 
consumption or injection facilities have been shown 
to reduce the likelihood of overdose-related deaths. 
According to Costello, there are currently two 
ongoing efforts to raise money for a drop-in 
center near the Green, but funding remains a 
significant hurdle. “It would make a big difference 
in the community if Yale would help out with that,” 
Costello says. Yale has historically been involved 
with providing access to treatment services in New 
Haven: the Hill Health Center, where Costello works, 
was founded in 1968 as a collaboration between 
the local community and doctors at the Yale School 
of Medicine. 

As Costello envisions it, the drop-in center would 
include a clinic and a sobering room where people could 
rest and recover in a safe and monitored environment, 
reducing the risk of arrest or hospitalization. “One of 
the biggest problems is that there just isn’t a place 
for these people to be able to go,” he says. “A lot of 
them just need a safe, warm space, where they can be 
consistently addressed by the same people.” The center 
would also have mailboxes where people experiencing 
homelessness could receive mail and staff members 
who could help with scheduling medical appointments. 
“Many people don’t think about this, but for people 
who don’t have regular phone service, scheduling 
medical appointments and getting treatment can 
be extremely difficult,” Costello says. “Even if an 
appointment is made, if nobody ever answers 
the phone to confirm the appointment, it’ll just
 get cancelled.” 

But other recent efforts to open treatment centers 
in New Haven have been met with backlash from 
a group of residents of the Hill, including Ward 3 
Alder Ron Hurt and Ward 4 Alder Evelyn Rodriguez, 
who claim that the city is already saturated with 
social services. Last fall, the New Haven Independent 
reported that community members resisted the Hill 
Health Center’s plan to build a new, $20 million, 
fifty-two-bed inpatient treatment center. Opponents 
argued that further increasing the relatively high 
concentration of treatment centers runs counter 
to efforts to make lower-income neighborhoods 
safer, pointing out that the area around the APT 
Foundation’s methadone clinic in the Hill has been 
the site of a disproportionate amount of crime. The 
plan for the treatment center was ultimately approved 
by the Board of Alders. 

Part of the resistance to the opening of new 
treatment centers in New Haven stems from the 
perception that this initiative would attract people 
from outside New Haven, who might create a drain on 
the city’s social services and contribute to higher crime 
rates. “We need to make sure that the surrounding 
towns and cities are adequately providing programs 
for their residents, so they don’t feel forced to come 
to New Haven for treatment,” Mayor Elicker says. 
“This is part of why this issue centers on the Green, 
because it’s right next to the bus stops, so it’s where 
these people spend their time.” 

But according to Costello, though many people do 
travel to New Haven to receive treatment, they usually 
return to their own communities at night and are 
unlikely to stay in New Haven. “They’re typically 
not the ones spending time on the Green,” he says. 
“Plus, the K2 incident had nothing to do with opiates, 
so blaming opiate treatment centers that are actually 
helping people get better just confuses things.”

Costello believes that building public support for 
the drop-in center near the Green is the most 
important factor in making the center a reality. In his 
view, increasing police presence on the Green without 
expanding access to treatment services nearby serves 
primarily to appease local business owners who feel 
that the prevalence of substance abuse on the Green is 
bad for business. “What we need to do is educate local 
businesses and community members,” he says. “We 
need to let everyone know that if people are inside 
getting help and staying safe, they’re not out in front 
of the storefronts, and they’re not having these issues 
on the Green.” When asked if he thinks the center 
will become a reality soon, Costello grimaces a little. 
“It’s a slow process,” he says, chuckling and shaking 
his head.


Ray Greene says he has noticed the fire department’s 
card program, and believes it’s making a difference. 
“People got to get this information somehow,” he says. 
But he believes a drop-in treatment center near the 
Green would be transformative. “You’ve always got 
to be moving around from place to place to get the 
services in New Haven, so if it was right here I bet a 
lot of the people here on the Green would be doing a 
lot better,” he says. 

He sees the Green as the best possible place to 
spend his time, but he says he wishes he felt more 
welcome there. “A lot of folks think of people hanging 
out on the Green as a nuisance, but I’m not trying to 
be a nuisance,” he says. “I just need a place to be.”  
After spending the night in Hamden, he says, he’ll 
return to the New Haven Green the next morning.
