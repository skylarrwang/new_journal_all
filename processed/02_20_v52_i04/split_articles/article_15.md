students are “academically just like other 
undergraduates but age-wise more like graduate 
students and faculty.” But some Eli Whitney 
veteran students have voiced that fitting in isn’t 
always easy. Former military medic Jake Fischer 
reflected that while “being a veteran didn’t make 
me stick out, being older could be awkward.” 
He described how Eli Whitney students aren’t 
allowed to live on campus and sometimes have 
trouble dating when most of their classmates are 
younger. Andrew Nguyen, a former Army Ranger, 
explained that he wanted to connect with people 
who have different outlooks in order to fully 
experience college life, so he joined an Alzheimer 
Buddies group, the Sigma Nu fraternity, and the 
Rugby team. 

Unlike Fischer and Nguyen, Browning is less 
“plugged in” to extracurricular activities on 
campus. While Browning originally wanted to 
“be super involved,” she “realized how little she 
knew” once classes began. Other students were 
quoting Foucault and seemed well-versed in 
classical texts. In order to catch up, the veteran 
journalist chose to “bare down” on academics 
because “everyone else felt so ahead” and placed 
less of an emphasis on clubs. Browning also has 
different day-to-day priorities than those of most 
undergraduates—instead of going to Toads or 
finding suite parties, she needs to buy groceries 
to cook dinner, get gas for her car, and finish 
renovation projects in her apartment. 

While Browning values her time at Yale, it 
became difficult for her to stay on campus with 
a hungry baby at home. Browning is one of the 
few Yale undergraduates who are parents. She 
said that the parenting support groups at Yale 
that she’s found are mainly geared toward faculty 
and graduate students, so she and her husband 
had to try especially hard to find communities of 
parents. Browning only recently found a group at 
the Office of International Students & Scholars 
and heard about a mom-baby fitness class.  

When Browning first got pregnant, she worried 
about how her baby would affect her schooling. 
She recalls that Risa Sodi, the dean of the Eli 
Whitney program, assured her that being a student 
would offer her a unique degree of flexibility 
during this time in her life.
Browning has built a home in New Haven 
with her husband and child, and she’s found 
community with other parents outside of Yale, 
whom she has met through her daughter. Now, in 
her senior spring, Browning is taking three classes, 
which add up to four hours of class per week. This 
relatively low course load has allowed her to take 
Lily to group playdates alongside her husband.“I 
could let my husband take her alone,” Browning 
said in an email, “but we enjoy watching her 
interact with other little ones, and these meet-ups 
are important for us too.”

As a new mother, Browning could only be away 
from home four to five hours at a time, so there 
have been instances when raising a newborn baby 
has come into conflict with Browning’s classes. 
Last semester, when Browning was taking two 
back-to-back seminars, her husband would bring 
Lily to campus and she would have to step out 
of class to breastfeed her. Browning missed most 
of the career fairs, which were held late in the 
afternoon, when she had to feed Lily. 

“I do lay awake at night wondering if I should 
be in the library more and at home less,” she said. 
“When people say, ‘Wow, how are you doing this 
mom/student thing?!’ I feel guilty, because I feel 
like I’m not actually doing it. My role as a mom 
is secure, but my role as a student feels fragile.” 

But Browning’s undergraduate peers have been 
a source of strength for her. “People usually give 
me too much credit,” Browning said. “I’ve said 
that I’m a mother in classes and people seem 
floored. My husband is a stay-at-home dad. I get a 
lot of support.” 

Browning’s secret society even threw her a 
surprise baby shower. At the party, she received 
face masks and bath bombs, and onesies, toys, and 
blankets for her baby.
