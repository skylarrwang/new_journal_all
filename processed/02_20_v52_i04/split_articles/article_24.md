EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Congrats! You’ve reached the end of our February issue—the last issue ever to be produced by The New 
Journal’s 2019-2020 Editorial Board. It has been a wild and wonderful year of friendship, carbs, and thir­
ty-six hour production weekends. To close out our last magazine, we collected some of our favorite lines 
from the previous four issues we worked on and presented them below, now totally out of context. Enjoy!
No one even noticed the explosion. “All the students slept 
through the night with a smile on their face.”

“Yale clientele are not necessarily dying; they’re 
not necessarily from here; and they come here very 
temporarily.”

When I asked Becky if her llamas are sexually frustrated, 
she hesitated—not because they do not encounter any 
difficulty but because I had misnamed her alpacas as 
llamas for the fifth time.

“I don’t think I’m the best person [to be mayor]. Barack 
Obama would be better than me,” he said solemnly.

I don’t have the nostalgia, the tinkering mindset, or the 
self-confidence required to go around telling people you 
collect decapitated snowmen, Supermen, and Rutherford 
B. Hayeses.

“Throwing away books is a very important thing,” he tells 
me.

Elicker wore his signature cornflower-blue shirt and held 
a Klean Kanteen gingerly with both hands as we spoke.

Wars brought shortages, and at times, the students found 
the food so unbearable that they threw the boiled beef on 
the floor and the rancid butter out the windows. 

I prayed that the Shiru Cafe Bot wouldn’t find out.

“I’m sure that men are attacked too,” she said.

The Yale truck parks in Quantum’s reception bay and 
empties the day’s load into a murky brown pool that the 
company’s vice president Brian Paganini calls a “really 
gross milkshake.”

A sign hung above the pen: You can’t buy happiness, but 
you can buy an ALPACA, and that’s kind of the same 
thing.

Ip remarked that certifying to be a drone pilot is “like 
going to the DMV.”

I’m here for journalistic investigation, I reminded myself 
as the tour finally began. I did NOT sign up through 
Match.com.

“Lean into it,” he said. “It’s supposed to feel like a washing 
machine.”

By some bizarre alchemy, a car ride through a “long 
tunnel” during that trip inspired Kakimoto to conceive of 
a coffee shop that, instead of making a profit by selling 
coffee, would gather data from students and sell it to 
companies looking to recruit them.

As he was getting out of a silver Buick, I recognized his 
bearded face and shouted, “Doug!” 

Burton reflects that unlike in Hadley, where his store is 
surrounded mostly by fields and cows, in New Haven 
“there’s some quirky people walking the street. It’s been 
fun.” 

Pings are comforting; gurgling is not a good sign. 

As more participants arrived, it became clear that the 
ghost tours are typically a couples, or perhaps aspiring 
couples, event. 

A little girl with a ponytail trailed curiously behind her 
teacher, hoping he would make the small blue robot move 
again.

Briefcase in hand, he halted his beeline towards the 
municipal building at 200 Orange Street and turned to 
face me.

My Toblerone bar had arrived; the drone flew away, 
arching over a line of buildings until it vanished from 
view.

“Racism, classism, elitism. Nah.”

A blended reality utopia? Perhaps.
