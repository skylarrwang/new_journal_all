THE  NEW  JOURNAL
It was snowing when I dialed, raining
when I hung up, chaos even for me
who mixes the chaff back into the wheat
and salts the on-ramps and rakes up needles
only to scatter them on the ground and
walk through as if to cut a covenant,
or sew one together. At dawn, with all
the inertia of imagination,
I laced my boots and cradled the laundry.
Is it even worth it to clean these clothes? 
No matter. When the washer door clicked shut
I knew that ours is not the slipped disk in
the spine of a novel, it’s just the end
and so we wring it out, make it lie flat.

Visitation
When my foot falls asleep I recall that
the body won’t evince itself or mist
its limbs with feeling more often, only
when it needs to tell me to get up and
move along. Last night a spindly old man
told me about the etymology
of a word, an insight so luminous
it made me stir and realize I must
have already known it in order to
dream that I learned it. But like Ishmael,
why say more? Leak awakens knowledge of
lack and now I’m staring at the drip from
the kitchen sink wondering if all the
oceans are peering down the spout, holding back.
