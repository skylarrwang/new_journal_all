looks at the wall behind me. “Unfortunately, after 
working here for so many years, you kind of get 
numb. Because it’s just one call after another call after 
another call.” 

The call center is more full of banter than one 
might expect, usually through small jibes that sneak 
their way in during the slowest hours of the day. A 
frequent instigator is Mancini, who came in second 
at a recent amateur stand-up competition, and who 
explains somewhat redundantly, after a half hour of 
wisecracking, that he likes to tell jokes: “That’s my self 
defense.” The other operators interviewed largely share 
his thoughts, but it is Durant who most succinctly 
expresses the importance of a sense of humor.  

“Sometimes we have to laugh and joke,” she says with 
a throaty chuckle. A light rain licks the rooftops behind 
her, out the window. “Sometimes we find ourselves 
laughing a lot just to keep from crying.”

Peet suggests that the most heartening consolation 
may come from a sense of purpose. “I don’t want to 
say there’s more positive than negative, because the 
negative’s pretty heavy, but I believe that the positives 
that do occur are so rewarding that they help to wash 
some of the negative away,” he says. “We try as managers 
to instill in their minds that people usually are calling 
911 at some of the most dire moments of their life, and 
you are the person that’s able to help them. So you 
can walk away knowing you did something good and 
valuable on that day.” 

The other operators agree. After his first gig out 
of the military, a post at Town Fair Tire which he 
describes as “a great fucking job,” Mancini says his 
late mother called him up. “She’s like, ‘Why don’t you 
help people?’” He shakes his head. He took the job as a 
dispatcher, he says, to serve the community. “I was born 
here; I was educated here; now I have the privilege of 
working here. I have a vested interest in seeing New 
Haven do well.”

The signature detachment of operators’ voices tends 
to conceal how much the job matters to them. Peet, 
the director, recalls a particularly brutal 2013 blizzard, 
which dumped more than four feet of snow on the city. 
“Any time we sent an ambulance out, within moments 
they were stuck,” he says. He remembers having to tell 
his operators that they could not leave because the 
doors downstairs were blocked. It was impossible for 
emergency services to reach those in need. Employees 
took turns sleeping in the office while their colleagues, 
exhausted as well, told frantic callers that they could 
not help. Caught up in the memory, Peet is somber. 
“As a public servant dedicated to safety, to tell someone 
you’re on your own—that doesn’t fit within anything 
that you have within you, let alone training.”

Before I leave, I sit for a half hour or so with 
Thornton at her desk while she supervises. As she 
recounts the decades’ worth of calls she has fielded, it 
seems like a dam breaks inside of her. The words come 
out in streams. She tells me about cars flipping over, 
cops being shot, how she managed these horrors as a 
single mom trying to raise her kids alone. At last she 
arrives back at the death of Officer Fumiatti, for whom 
she felt responsible as his dispatcher, at which point we 
both realize her cheeks are wet. Out of her hundreds 
of thousands of dispatches, many heroic successes, this 
one remains with her. I ask Thornton how one deals 
with it all. “You don’t,” she says. She turns away; the 
phone is ringing.
