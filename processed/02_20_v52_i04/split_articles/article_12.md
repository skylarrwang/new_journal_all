THE  NEW  JOURNAL
The New Haven Green, the city’s most central 
public park, came to national attention in August 
2018, when 116 people were hospitalized after 
ingesting K2 there. K2 is a drug often described as a 
form of synthetic marijuana, but in reality, the two 
drugs have vastly different compositions, and K2 is 
significantly more dangerous.     

Greene says he has noticed a greater police 
presence since the mass K2 overdose in 2018. 
“They’re definitely around here more since then, 
just making their faces known,” he says of the 
police officers. “It’s probably for the tourists and 
the families that want to come here, I guess. That’s 
their priority.” 

The police aren’t the only people who have been 
frequenting the public park lately. Phil Costello, an 
advanced practice registered nurse and the clinical 
director for Homeless Care at the Cornell Scott 
Hill Health Center, spends much of his time on the 
A
s darkness begins to fall, lampposts flicker 
to life across the New Haven Green, 
illuminating the crisscrossing pathways 
and park benches. The place is almost completely 
deserted, save for a few people emerging from Center 
Church. Ray Greene,  who is currently experiencing 
homelessness and receiving treatment for substance 
use disorder, stands on the corner waiting for the 
bus back to the town of Hamden, Connecticut. He’s 
bundled in a thick winter coat, and wears several 
pairs of thin cotton gloves. On his back he carries 
a large, worn-out backpack, which he says contains 
most of his belongings.

per capita in the country; New Haven County 
consistently ranks among the highest in the state 
for per-capita rates of overdoses, according to the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health. “The 
biggest thing that came out of this whole K2 thing is 
that it made the city more aware of what we all already 
knew, which is that our people desperately need help,” 
Costello says. 

Shortly after the K2 poisoning, then-Mayor Toni 
Harp outlined a number of initiatives intended to 
address the problems presented by substance use 
disorder in New Haven. Through his work on the 
Green, Costello witnessed the implementation and 
effects of these projects firsthand. Among the initiatives 
was the New Haven Police Department’s adoption of 
hot spot technology, which allows officers to track drug 
overdoses throughout the Northeast and anticipate 
spikes in overdoses in New Haven before they occur. In 
the past year, the New Haven Fire Department has also 
partnered with local treatment centers to print cards 
with information about New Haven-based services. 

New Haven Green, stopping at each park bench to 
chat with people and checking the vital signs of 
anyone who appears to be unconscious or at risk 
of an overdose. Greene says he often sees Costello 
making his rounds on the Green. “It’s good to 
know there’s somebody who’s looking out,” he says.

   It’s around dinnertime on a cold night in 
February, and Phil Costello is standing by the 
entrance of the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen 
on Temple Street. He’s leaning against the door of 
his black pick-up truck, wearing black scrubs. He 
carries two heavy backpacks, one slung over each 
of his broad shoulders. Patrons of the soup kitchen 
are shuffling towards the entrance for dinner. 
Many are coming from the New Haven Green, less 
than a block away. Most greet Costello by name 
as they pass, and he does the same. “Hey,” he says 
to a man standing by the entrance and smoking 
a cigarette. “How’re you feeling this week? How’s 
your breathing?” They chat amiably for a few 
minutes, cracking jokes and discussing the man’s 
various health issues.

Costello describes his specialty as “street 
medicine,” which primarily involves checking up 
on members of the New Haven community who 
are experiencing homelessness. Much of his work 
centers around the intersection of homelessness 
and addiction. “The people I usually work with 
spend most of their time just trying to figure 
out how to survive,” he says. “That makes finding 
windows of sobriety and stability in which to 
provide consistent and actually effective treatment 
for addiction or anything else particularly difficult.” 

As Costello sees it, his work both prevents 
unnecessary,  and expensive emergency room visits 
and ensures that people who do need emergency 
treatment at a hospital get it. 

Costello was making his rounds on the Green 
when the 2018 overdoses began, and he was 
one of the first responders to treat the overdose 
victims. Though he describes the amount of K2 
present on the Green that day as an anomaly, he 
believes the event was consistent with the rise in 
substance abuse disorder he had observed on the 
Green in years prior. Connecticut currently has 
the ninth highest rate of opioid-related deaths 
“The people 
I usually 
work with 
spend most 
of their time 
just trying 
to figure 
out how to 
survive.”
