measure in the mail if you’re overweight, as 
they did to plaintiff Mary Brassil. Or call and 
email multiple times a day, until you answer, 
as they did to Noah, a law enforcement official 
and a spouse of a Yale employee. 

Noah, whose name has been changed in this 
story to protect his privacy, has a hard time 
talking about TrestleTree without raising his 
voice. “I’m a private person,” he  said, “so right 
off the bat, the concept of talking to someone 
on the telephone who I’ve never met, who’s not 
a doctor, who’s not my doctor, who’s really not 
a stakeholder in my health felt totally invasive, 
over the top, and unnecessary.” Noah was 
recently hospitalized after Sudafed mixed badly 
with the diuretic pills he takes for his blood 
pressure. After this incident, HEP required him 
to see a health coach. Noah had sorted out what 
went wrong with his doctor, and he was soon 
feeling well again. 

Yet when Noah was released from the 
hospital, he still had to meet with a TrestleTree 
health coach. “Right off the bat, a gun was put 
to my head,” he tells me. The coach called him 
at work, and when he didn’t pick up, she would 
call again. And then email him. And email 
again. He explains that the whole experience 
was “invasive, condescending and bordering on 
harassment.” 

Noah felt like his coach was in his face even 
through the phone: “When did you weigh 
yourself this week? How much did you weigh?” 
He received calls multiple times throughout 
his work day and would have to complete his 
sessions during his free time. His coach, he 
said, obviously seemed to be reading from a 
script. Even though he explained to her he had 
to do one hundred sit-ups and one hundred 
push-ups a day for law enforcement training, 
she kept calling him to ask if he completed 
the core workout she recommended. Then she 
would email him the link to it. Again.

For a company that seems to have so much 
information about its clients, Trestletree 
publicizes very little information about itself. 
None of the Yale employees I spoke to could 
tell me the name of their assigned coach, how 
the company got their health information, 
where TrestleTree is located. 

I decided to investigate. Next door to Yale 
Human Resources on 221 Whitney is a brick 
building with what looks like an abandoned 
construction 
project 
blocking 
the 
front 
entrance. 205 Whitney Avenue. The sign in 
front advertises a construction company, Yale’s 
Women Faculty Forum, a nonprofit. There’s no 
mention of TrestleTree.

If you walk inside and turn left at the stairs, 
there’s a printed paper sign leaning against the 
wall, reading “TrestleTree Health Coaching 
(Office on the 2nd floor).” I take a picture. 
My first proof that the company’s real. I walk 
upstairs and the office seems abandoned. Each 
room has a scale. There’s a BMI chart. It seems 
more like a weight loss coach’s office than a 
health one.

A woman with a short blonde haircut, one of 
the coaches, is in her office. She tells me she 
really can’t say anything when I approach her. 
She seems nervous. She stands up immediately 
when I introduce myself and starts to usher 
me out. She tells me everything said has to 
be approved by her manager. I keep pressing 
but I’m met by silence. She brings me to her 
manager, a slightly younger woman with a 
similar blonde short haircut, and they share 
a look of rolled eyes and tight smiles before 
looking towards me. I can tell their lips are 
going to stay pressed together. I’m directed to 
check out the National Board for Health and 
Wellness Coaching for any more information. I 
leave carrying a post-it note with the URL. 

Barbara, an employee at Yale who requested 
that her name be changed in this article due 
to a fear of retribution, was flagged as someone 
who needed coaching, she suspects, because of 
her clinical anxiety. But her whole experience 
with the coaches, she tells me, stressed her

out more. “I’m so pissed off honey, I can’t even 
tell you,” she’s smiling, and she says this through 
her teeth. We’re sitting so close together that I 
can feel her breath on my face. She tells me she 
has bronchitis, a polite warning I suppose, and 
I try to subtly shift away without offending. But, 
really, I’m not that worried. As a student at Yale, 
my healthcare is simple. Yes, sometimes the walk 
to Yale Health is cold and long, and sometimes 
there’s a wait. But beyond that, I never really 
worry that much when I feel sick. I just go to the 
clinic. I lean back in, deciding, slightly guiltily, 
that hearing her was worth the risk of sickness.

Barbara whispers, “You have to be careful here.” 
Her eyes are wide as they scan the room. Blue 
State on York Street is brimming with students—
finishing their morning Hindi homework, eating 
a croissant after morning lift, trying to fit a 
Constitutional Law textbook and coffee on the 
small table. There’s no maintenance staff in the 
cafe. Or technical staff. Or clerks. No Union 34 
or 35 workers. Nobody here would quite know 
what we’re talking about. But Barbara already 
feels targeted, surveilled, and she’s worried. So, 
we whisper.

“It’s such an intrusion,” she says of her coaching 
experience. “I said to [the coach] ‘Do you want 
know about my bills at home too? My mortgage?’ 
Seriously.” Barbara said she would rather give the 
health coach her financial information than her 
health history. “Medical records are so personal.”

A few minutes after Barbara leaves our interview, 
she returns and sits down next to me again, a 
little flushed from the cold, a little flustered by 
her thoughts. She’s speaking quickly and louder. 
“I just want to let you know I’m not against this 
university. I’m grateful for my job.” I assure her I 
understand. She pauses for a moment. “There’s 
just some bad stuff that goes on here,” she says.
