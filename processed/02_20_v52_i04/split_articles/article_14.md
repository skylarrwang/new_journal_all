Hillary Browning is a senior in 
Hopper 
College—but 
she 
never 
endured Bingham Hall or made a 
home out of the Hopper Courtyard. She lives 
a few blocks away from Wooster Square Park in 
New Haven. Half-marathon certificates, heart-
warming pictures, and mementos from her 
military past speckle the wall of her apartment. 
Her husband, James, a Navy veteran with a warm 
smile and dressed in a simple t-shirt and jeans, 
greeted us in the home’s foyer as he sat on the 
wooden floors playing with their ten-month-old. 
Round, bright-eyed, and excited but shy, the baby, 
Lily, crawled on a multicolored play mat.

James isn’t the only Navy vet in the house. 
Browning served as a journalist in the Navy for 
six years. Upon retiring from the military, she 
applied to Yale through the Eli Whitney Students 
Program, which provides a pathway to the 
college for nontraditional students—people who 
have taken at least five years away from formal 
education. In August 2016, when Browning was 
24, she moved to New Haven and enrolled at Yale. 
Fewer than two years later, as a sophomore, she 
would give birth to Lily, her first child.

Each veteran carries their own story, reasons 
for serving, and experiences. Browning, a petite 
brunette who loves writing, explained that she 
initially didn’t consider college because of her 
high school grades. She worked at a restaurant 
until a recruiter called her out of the blue due 
to her military entrance test scores. Her parents 
were unconvinced that their sensitive daughter 
would join. At the age of 19, in 2012, Browning 
decided to enter the Navy as a journalist to prove 
her parents wrong. 	

As a military journalist, Browning was first 
stationed in Sasebo, Japan, tasked with creating 
commercials and hosting radio shows for the 
American Forces Networks. While producing 
video-news in Sasebo, Browning met her husband 
James, a bomb disposal technician concurrently 
stationed in Japan.

Eventually, Browning was deployed for seven 
months to Bagram, Afghanistan, where she 
documented military history. She later spent 
time on the USS Eisenhower ship, serving as the 
editor-in-chief of the boat’s daily newspaper. 
For a long time, a school like Yale didn’t even 
seem like a possibility for her. “The military 
teaches you that you’re replaceable,” she said. 
“When people get discharged, they feel like one of 
the many, so they don’t apply to schools like Yale,” 
whose applicants hope to be one of the selected 
few. However, an advisor at Service to School 
(S2S), a non-profit that assists military veterans 
with the college application process, encouraged 
her to apply. “Without the Eli Whitney school 
program, Yale would be inaccessible,” Browning 
said. 

Most military veterans in Yale College are 
enrolled through the Eli Whitney program, which 
has an annual class of around thirty students. 
While the program enrolls students from all 
sorts of backgrounds, it has, within the last 
decade, started to accept more and more military 
veterans. In 2010, not a single veteran studied as 
an undergraduate at Yale; today, there are sixteen 
veterans and one active duty member of the 
Marine Corps in the undergraduate student body. 
Part of what explains this increase is that, in 
2015, Yale became the first participant in Service 
to School’s Vetlink program, which provides 
college counseling for high-achieving U.S. 
military veterans and seeks to match them with 
the nation’s most selective universities.

Eli Whitney Program, explained that Eli Whitney
