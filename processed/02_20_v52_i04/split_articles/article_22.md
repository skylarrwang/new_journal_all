If you enter Yale Law School and make a 
left up the stairs, you’ll notice the stained-
glass window portraits—a lawyer with a 
quilled pen, a judge clutching a case, the scales 
of justice—guiding you as you ascend. Rosanna 
Gonsiewski, a senior administrative assistant, 
climbs past those windows to her third-floor office 
every day, but she has yet to reach the promise 
of justice they hold. We meet on a quiet Friday 
afternoon inside her office, which we’re both 
relieved is empty. Her coworker is taking a sick 
day. Gonsiewski, I learn, holds onto those tightly. 
Especially after she used up twelve to satisfy Yale’s 
Health Expectations Program, or HEP.

Gonsiewski spent all of her sick days getting 
colonoscopies—not because her doctor mandated 
them, but because Yale, her employer, forced 
them.

After her fiftieth birthday, Gonsiewski received 
a notification that HEP, a mandatory health 
screening and “coaching” system for many of Yale’s 
unionized employees, was requiring her to get a 
colonoscopy. “Some of this is really disgusting,” 
she warns me. She laughs and puts her hands to 
her face, her brown curly hair bounces in front 
of her eyes. Gonsiewski had been previously 
diagnosed with an irritable bowel, so she knew 
that cleaning out her system for a colonoscopy 
wasn’t going to be an easy process. But if she didn’t 
complete the exam six months after her birthday, 
her paycheck would start to drop $25 a week—a 
cost she couldn’t afford. So she scheduled the 
colonoscopy for a month after her birthday. Then 
the complications began.

At first, she only planned to take three days off 
of work: one day for a clearing of the system before 
the procedure, one day for the colonoscopy, and 
one day for recovery. But during the first procedure 
her prescription medicine counteracted the 
anesthesia, and she was screaming “Ow!” on the 
operating table. They had to redo the procedure. 
Another three days off work. This time, her system 
wasn’t cleared and she would have to do two days 
of prep. Four more days off work. Ten sick days 
used.

Gonsiewski was irritated. After working so hard 
to accumulate her sick days, HEP was eating 
away at them. “This was not something I deemed 
an emergency,” she tells me. If it had been her 
choice, she would have waited to complete the 
colonoscopy during a break. Yet under HEP, the 
medical decision wasn’t hers to make. It was Yale’s. 
And the threat of losing $25 a week, Gonsiewski 
tells me, “instill[ed] so much fear” that she had 
to get the test done. Twenty-five dollars a week 
is $100 a month. One thousand three hundred 
dollars a year. It’s groceries for five weeks in New 
Haven. A month’s rent. Childcare. Money towards 
a mortgage. Part of her daughter’s tuition.

Last spring when Gonsiewski got the flu, she 
was too dizzy and feverish to come to work for 
four days. When she returned, she learned two 
Yale requires many of its unionized employees to 
disclose private medical information and undergo 
“wellness coaching.” Those who refuse have to pay.

of the days she was out sick were going to come 
out of her paycheck. Gonsiewski couldn’t believe 
it. She always left herself a cushion of sick days 
for medical emergencies like this. But after the 
colonoscopies required by HEP, she had none left 
until July 1. With a chronically ill husband and 
daughter in college, Gonsiewski couldn’t afford to 
miss even the days of pay that were already gone. 
She wouldn’t be able to take a sick or vacation day 
between March and July.

Gonsiewski is one of around 5,400 clerical, 
technical, cafeteria, maintenance, and power 
plant workers at Yale, who, belonging to unions 
Local 34 and 35, have been required to enroll in 
Yale’s Health Expectations Program since January 
2017. HEP also applies to those employees’ 
spouses and dependents who use Yale Health or 
Aetna insurance. If employees (and dependents) 
don’t comply or choose to opt out, they suffer a 
fine of $25 per week.

Yale rolled out the workplace wellness program 
of HEP with the hope of keeping employees 
healthy—and also with the hope of reducing 
the money it spends on healthcare. In theory, 
if Yale could identify an employee’s health 
problem early, they could act early and avoid 
serious healthcare costs. Local 34 and 35 provide 
employees with affordable health care plans—
with a $0 premium option if employees elect the 
Yale Health insurance. Yale was threatening to 
increase healthcare costs substantially, so HEP 
was negotiated as an alternative, lower cost option.

But when employees enroll in HEP, they 
are shepherded through a long list of invasive 
screenings and tests, like the colonoscopy 
Gonsiewski underwent. Christine Turcek, a first 
line cook at JE, who had a double mastectomy 
after battling breast cancer, was forced to get 
a mammogram under HEP. Even though she 
medically couldn’t complete the breast exam, she 
was still threatened with the fine. It took repeated 
long explanations to HEP representatives—
which forced her  to relive her experience with 
cancer each time—in order for them to grant 
her an exemption for the test. If an employee 
doesn’t complete HEP’s requirements by a certain 
deadline, the $25 per week pay dock begins. The 
weekly deductions continue for at least three 
months, regardless of whether the requirement is 
fulfilled before that period ends. 

Although it’s not unheard of for companies 
to charge penalties for opting out of wellness 
programs, Yale’s non-compliance fee is among the 
highest in the country, according to the American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), meaning 
HEP is among the nation’s most punitive wellness 
programs.


Jason Schwartz, a locksmith at Yale, refuses to 
comply with HEP on principle. He takes the $25 
a week pay cut, his version of a silent protest. “For 
some people that work at Yale, $25 is a lot more 
money than it is for me,” he tells me when we 
meet at Blue State on Wall Street. Some people in 
his union earn only $16.92 per hour, and it’s often 
harder for them to accept the cut. 

He leans across the table to whisper. “But I had 
to cut down on non-necessities,” he says. He used 
to visit his in-laws in the Philippines every year. 
The trip was something that he always looked 
forward to, but with the pay cut he’s suffered from 
not complying with HEP, he says he can no longer 
afford to go. His wife and daughter will go without 
him this year. 

Schwartz is right: For many of Yale’s lowest-paid 
employees, like Gonsiewski, the choice to opt out 
isn’t financially feasible. That’s why Gonsiewski 
joined leading plaintiff Lisa Kwesell, a part-time 
service assistant at Yale, to sue Yale and to make 
HEP participation voluntary. The plaintiffs assert 
that HEP is “coercive.” 

Under the American Disabilities Act and 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 
employers can collect medical and genetic 
information from their employees only if they 
provide the information voluntarily. Since 
this law was enacted, there have been disputes 
over what “voluntarily” means. In 2016, it 
was deemed that employers could charge 
employees up to 30 percent of their insurance 
premium as a penalty for not participating in 
wellness programs—and still call the program 
“voluntary.” But in 2018, the AARP, which 
is known for fighting for employee rights in 
workplace wellness lawsuits, won a lawsuit that 
got rid of this clause in the law. Nothing was 
left in its place. With no new guidelines, just an 
absence of old ones, the question of what makes 
a program “voluntary” is now entirely up for 
interpretation. Yale declined to comment on 
the case due to the ongoing litigation, but the 
University’s legal stance is that HEP qualifies as 
voluntary. Many required to participate in the 
program disagree. Their legal battle with Yale 
has been proceeding for two years—with no 
clear end in sight.  

HEP’s testing isn’t just problematic for 
those who have experienced certain medical 
conditions. Over-screening can cause “people 
to feel more vulnerable, to be terrorized by 
false alarms, and to be overdiagnosed and 
overtreated,” says Gilbert Welch a professor 
at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of 
Medicine. 

Some employees are particularly concerned 
with how HEP affects the privacy of their 
medical records. HEP is implemented not 
through Yale, but through a third-party 
company known as a wellness vendor, called 
HealthMine. Gonsiewski was shocked to learn 
she had to send her private information to a 
company she had never heard of. She had no 
idea a different company was administering the 
program until she received the link to register.

HealthMine gathers HEP members’ test 
results and insurance claims and sorts through 
the data. The company flags employees with 
high weight or blood pressure, diabetes or 
heart disease. It gathers their health records. 
And it reveals their information to yet another 
third-party company, TrestleTree. TrestleTree 
then connects the employees with mandatory 
health wellness coaches—nurses or dieticians 
who focus on providing strategies for managing 
stress and weight. 

Yale calls TrestleTree a “health transformation 
organization” on the HEP website. But 
TrestleTree is not a covered entity under the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act, or HIPAA, a law that protects patients’ 
privacy. When enrolling in HEP, employees 
sign a contract that states, “I also understand that 
information disclosed under this authorization 
may no longer be subject to the HIPAA privacy 
rules.” Yale employee’s health information 
is then accessible to TrestleTree—and to the 
organization’s wellness coaches. 

Yale claims that these health care coaches 
are “highly trained.” In fact, the only training 
required of TrestleTree coaches is a three-
week program in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Yet 
these coaches are supposed to provide in-depth 
health counseling sessions, much longer and 
more intimate than one might have even with 
their own doctor.

In flyers sent to employee homes, Yale writes 
that TrestleTree’s health care coaches will “be 
a trusted guide and advisor for you and your 
health.” What Yale doesn’t say is that the health 
care coaches might pester you with phone calls 
until you complete a mandatory three-hour 
session with them. They might send you a tape 
Noah felt like his 
coach was in his face 
even through the 
phone: “When did you 
weigh yourself this 
week? How much did 
you weigh?”
