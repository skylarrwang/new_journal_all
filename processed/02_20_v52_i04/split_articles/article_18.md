in nearby houses. Clyburn said she has parked outside of 
those houses for hours at a time, watching cars driving 
in and out, to see if the complaints checked out before 
relaying them to landlords or to the police. She recalled 
that one day, as she was walking down Reed Street, 
someone came up behind her and imitated the sound of a 
gun, threatening her. Clyburn kept walking. “I didn’t pay 
them no attention,” she said calmly, “because I know why 
I’m out there.” She scrolled through more photos on her 
phone, showing me the license plate of a double-parked 
car and a pile of chopped-up tree branches lying on the 
sidewalk.

“When I took this ward, I fought for this ward. For 
Downtown to even care about us,” Clyburn told me. “I 
felt like we were foster kids with no voice.” 
Clyburn goes to constituents’ homes nearly every 
week—not only to help them apply for government 
programs, as in Anderson’s case, but also to spread the 
word about public meetings, or to check in about whether 
landlords have responded to grievances. When she meets 
with constituents, she’ll ask about their daughters or how 
their health has been lately. These visits, she says, are her 
way of “loving on them.” 
On a day off from work, she once spent six hours talking 
to residents of an elderly housing complex in her ward 
who had complained of slow repairs. She made a habit of 
driving bimonthly food deliveries from a nonprofit called 
FISH to her homebound neighbors; she and three friends 
delivered food to all of FISH’s clients in the ward. When 
14-year-old Tyrick Keyes died from gunfire in her ward 
in 2017, Clyburn sat with his mother in the hospital and 
mobilized neighbors to cook food for her after the funeral. 
“My Reed Street is my love street,” she said in passing 
once, in reference to the street where Keyes’s family lived. 
“It’s not just a portion who should be loved,” Clyburn 
said; every part of the city deserves equal access to 
resources. “I call it love,” she added. “But love could be 
the way we let development come, the way we let our 
schools be, housing, the cost of things, how they keep 
things clean, our parks, whatever. Everybody should be 
treated the same. But everybody was not.”

Door by door, Clyburn has urged neighbors to demand 
love from a political system that was never meant to hear 
them. When she first got elected, she found fifteen of her 
neighbors willing to commit to serving as community 
organizers within the ward. Alongside Clyburn, the team 
of fifteen met regularly and urged neighbors to vote, 
join city commissions, and voice their opinions at public 
hearings. 
Newhallville “changed a hell of a lot” since Clyburn 
took office, Lawrence said. “She let people know that you 
actually can trust someone that’s in politics… From day 
one, it was about the people, until today, it’s about the 
people.”
The difference could be felt from the highest office in 
City Hall. “When I think about Newhallville when I first 
ran … I went to some of the streets not too far from here,

and there was a real sense of despair,” New Haven’s former 
mayor, Toni Harp, said at Clyburn’s re-election campaign 
launch in July 2019. Harp and Clyburn both took office 
in 2012. “What we’ve seen happen here… we have seen a 
transformation,” Harp said.
Newhallville’s Ward 20 now has one of the highest 
rates of voter turnout of all thirty wards in New Haven; 
Newhallville resident Barbara Vereen proudly declared 
the ward to be “the highest voting Black ward in this city.” 
When Barack Obama ran for re-election as president in 
2012, over two thousand voters waited in an hours-long 
line in Ward 20, the third-largest turnout in the city, close 
behind the whiter and more affluent neighborhoods of 
East Rock and Westville.
Five years ago, during her second term in office, 
Clyburn and other community activists beautified and 
rebranded the “Mudhole” as “the Learning Corridor.” 
One nearby resident, Doreen Abubakar, secures regular 
grants to fund biking and outdoor education programs 
there. The block hosts an annual Harvest Festival in the 
fall. In August, child reporters in the neighborhood’s 
Kids TV program released a mini-documentary about the 
block’s dramatic transformation. 
During 
this 
period, 
Newhallville’s 
Community 
Management Team—one of the city’s twelve neighborhood-
based committees that provide an opportunity for residents 
to weigh in on new development projects and hear updates 
from city officials—grew to become one of the most active 
and effective in town, at least on par with those of New 
Haven’s wealthiest neighborhoods. Clyburn was one of 
the people who worked to bolster the group, urging more 
and more of her neighbors to come out to meetings. A 
group of more than thirty people, mostly Newhallville 
residents, had come out for the group’s monthly meeting 
in September 2019, sitting around several circular tables 
with built-in blue stools. 
As neighbors and guests offered updates and 
announcements, the Management Team’s chair, local 
preschool director Kim Harris, rallied the group to 
participate in upcoming events. It didn’t seem to matter 
what people advocated for; what was most important 
to Harris was that the neighborhood’s voice was heard. 
“Let’s flood the house with Newhallville people,” she 
said, referring to a city meeting about public housing. 
Of another public meeting: “I just want to flood [it] with 
Newhallville people ‘cause there’s a lot of things going on, 
and we’re gonna know about it.”
Soon, Harris announced a gala hosted by the Board of 
Alders’ Black and Hispanic Caucus in late October. She 
wanted to have a table of Newhallville residents there. 
Tickets were seventy-five dollars, but to Harris, they were 
well worth the cost. “That’s the best seventy-five dollars 
I’ve ever spent,” she told the group. “I get to tell them, 
‘Newhallville, Newhallville, Newhallville.’”
She urged the group to go. “If we got to lay away twenty 
dollars a week to make it, let’s lay away twenty dollars a 
week so that we could be amongst the people making 
decisions for us.”

Clyburn’s relationship-centered, community-powered 
approach to political leadership has proven its power, but 
it’s also taken a toll. By her fourth term as alder, a few of 
the neighbors she most relied on had passed away. Clyburn 
tried to take on their work by herself. “Things started—I 
started breaking down,” she said. She swallowed, held her 
voice together. “It’s a lot to take on, one person.”
Clyburn began to receive calls about Ward 20 during 
her shifts at the group home where she worked, which 
sometimes got her into trouble with her boss. Her doctors 
implored her to take better care of her health. She had 
also started withdrawing from her personal finances to 
assist her constituents—particularly the elderly residents. 
She would help cover light bills and gas bills. Clyburn 
even paid one hundred dollars to remove a wheel boot 
that the city had placed on a young man’s car. “He had to 
go to work,” she said. “I didn’t really know him that well, 
but he was in my ward.”
Throughout her forty-one-year marriage, Clyburn was 
in charge of paying the gas and electricity bills for her and 
her husband’s home; the rest of her paycheck was hers 
to spend on what she wanted. But as she lent money to 
her constituents, Clyburn began to ask for her husband’s 
help with utility bills. Their kids were paying their own 
expenses, and her husband grew suspicious. Someone 
finally told him that she had been helping neighbors with 
expenses; now, she has to make up the lost money herself. 
Clyburn laughed as she recalled what her husband said: 
“Nobody’s gonna help us Delphine, remember?” 
Clyburn started to work overtime to make up for the 
money she gave to her constituents, sometimes starting 
her shift at 6 a.m. and leaving at 11 p.m. “I was putting 
the ward before my health, and my family, everything,” 
Clyburn said. 
There is only so much love—only so much time, only 
so much money—that one person can muster. “I’m still

now trying to pull out of my financial base from what I did 
to my family,” Clyburn said. “I’m struggling back now to 
rebuild our little nest egg over the years.” 

Time slipped by inside Ella Anderson’s home on 
Starr Street. Channel 8 hummed on the TV in the 
living room, interrupted by occasional Black Friday ads 
and a paid message from then-mayoral candidate Justin 
Elicker. Sitting at the dining room table, Clyburn took 
out one of the required Energy Assistance forms and 
walked Anderson through it, pointing out the places 
where a signature was required. Periodically, Anderson 
retreated to the kitchen and brought out another form 
or bill that seemed redundant or perplexing. The papers 
accumulated on the table amidst piles of notecards and 
mailers and other receipts. Slowly, Clyburn and Anderson 
pieced together the source of confusion: it seemed that 
the Community Action Agency of New Haven had sent 
Anderson an extra form.
“If I could just get a person to talk to me…” Clyburn 
said.
As Clyburn called up the Community Action Agency, 
Anderson read the words printed on Clyburn’s campaign 
flyer in a murmur: Strong constituent services… She 
proclaimed that the photograph on the flyer was beautiful. 
No one answered Clyburn’s call. The agency’s voicemail 
was full. 
Anderson retrieved a new form from the pile, and 
Clyburn read aloud that Anderson could learn more 
about the status of her benefits if she created an online 
account, accessible on her computer and smartphone. 
But Anderson doesn’t use the Internet. “I keep telling 
them, they think everyone has that,” Clyburn sighed.
Clyburn gently folded the Energy Assistance forms 
and placed them on top of a pile of mail. “These are very 
important,” she said. 
Next time, Clyburn said, she’ll come with a plastic bin 
and a set of dividers. She’ll sit down and help Anderson 
organize her financial records by year.
“I figured, if I could have you, things could work out,” 
Anderson told Clyburn. “I’m just not used to people going 
out of their way to help me.”
But Clyburn couldn’t stay forever. It was almost 1 
p.m., and she had to be at work in an hour. She stood up 
soon after to leave the house and cross the street, where 
she would deliver a few last election flyers to people’s 
doorsteps.
