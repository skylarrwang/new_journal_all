happen if she pulled the plug on her husband? How 
long would it take for him to pass away? (She has 
since learned that the time frame can range anywhere 
from immediately to a few weeks.) She realized how 
little she knew, standing in the sterile hospital hallway, 
helpless. “That was a whole new pitch-black room 
that I was looking into,” Reynolds said. 

Without guidance, the process of facing death or 
grieving can be overwhelming, even all-consuming. 
With only doctors to direct her through the process, 
Reynolds felt lost.

The work done by death doulas often overlaps with 
the treatment provided by palliative care doctors, 
who offer the most holistic medical care available 
for patients suffering from long-term or terminal 
illness. At Yale New Haven Hospital’s palliative 
care department, a doctor first evaluates a patient’s 
condition on a scale of zero to one hundred, with 
one hundred indicating perfect health. Afterwards, 
the patient sits down with the doctor to outline their 
“Goals of Care,” which allows the palliative care team 
to understand what matters most based on the patient’s 
desires and preferences. The doctor then constructs a 
plan of care, which may include pain medication and 
physical therapy. Similarly, doulas sit down with their 
clients to talk through what they want most in their last 
few weeks. The doctors connect patients with chaplains 
and art therapists, something that death doulas also 
regularly do.

But there is a systemic shortage of palliative care, 
which makes palliative care departments short-staffed 
and limits the amount of time that can be spent on 
each patient. While there are only 1,400 palliative care 
centers nationwide, 42 percent of all Americans have 
had a friend or relative suffer from terminal illness in 
the past five years. Palliative care specialists at Duke 
University estimated in June 2019 that there is 
one palliative care physician for every 808 general 
patients in the United States. At Yale New Haven 
Hospital, the palliative care department, comprised 
of twenty-five staff members, cares for thirty five to 
fifty patients at any given time, according to Mark 
Swidler, a palliative care doctor at YNHH. This 
number is a small fraction of the 1,541 beds available 
at the hospital—which explains where end-of-life 
doulas step in. They do what palliative care doctors 
and hospitals cannot: provide hours and hours of 
constant, undivided care to the dying. 

Part of the reason that palliative care departments 
cannot keep up with demand is that they are underfunded. 
Most patients enrolled in palliative care are above the 
age of 65, so Medicare pays for a large percentage of 
their palliative care costs. According to Health Affairs, 
Medicare’s approach to reimbursement favors medical 
procedures over palliative care procedures. In other 
words, Medicare doesn’t cover palliative care to the 
extent that it does other medical expenses. This disparity 
in reimbursement is visible in doctors’ paycheck gaps. 
In New Haven, general surgeons earn $161,000 more 
per year than palliative care physicians, according 
to Glassdoor. 

Bonafé is a strong proponent of palliative care, but 
recognizes its current limitations. “They’re not given 
a lot of space and resources to function,” she said. She 
wants palliative care physicians to refer patients to her 
doula practice, but she says her meetings with doctors 
at YNHH have been fruitless.

Laura Morrison, a palliative care doctor at YNHH, 
hesitates to refer her patients to doulas because 
health insurance does not cover doula fees. “It’s 
harder to refer when it’s financially out of pocket,” 
said Morrison.

“They just need to know that we are around to help 
them do an even better job,” Bonafé said. “Until they 
understand that, we are not going to be welcome with 
open arms.” 

In December 2018, Bonafé took on a client, a retired 
German professor at Yale whom I’ll refer to as Sara 
for the sake of confidentiality. She was dying from 
cancer and had no living family. During her last four 
weeks, Sara moved into a nearby hospice, and Bonafé 
visited her daily. Beyond advocating for her needs, 
such as readjusting her laxative medication when Sara 
experienced debilitating diarrhea or speaking to the 
front office when a staff member made a rude remark 
(“Well, you’re not going to be here long!”), Bonafé 
made sure that Sara’s experience was as peaceful as 
possible. When Bonafé noticed that a jazz guitarist 
came to play on the weekends, she scheduled a concert 
in Sara’s room. Sara loved jazz. “She was absolutely 
delighted,” Bonafé reminisced, with a wistful smile.

diagnosis. The following day, Bonafé brought a 
bottle of French wine, and they enjoyed a glass together 
in the waning afternoon light. Bonafé recalled that 
Sara said, in a burst of joy, “I don’t remember ever 
having such good wine.”

“She was in heaven,” said Bonafé later. “It brought 
her so much joy. I saw her big smile, and that rush 
of dopamine.” When Sara passed away weeks later, 
Bonafé combed through Sara’s apartment, donating 
furniture and passing important legal documents to 
her attorney. 

Those surrounded by family members can also 
benefit 
from 
working 
with 
doulas. 
Sharon 
McCullough, an end-of-life doula working out of 
Southington, Connecticut, is trained in Clear Light 
Meditation, which helps make the dying process more 
tranquil through bedside meditation. Last year, one 
of McCullough’s clients lived in hospice care for the 
last few days of his life. The client had recently ended 
a series of aggressive treatments that left his family 
in a state of stress and conflict. McCullough decided 
to lead a meditation at his deathbed. “I was able to 
provide peace in a turmoil-filled environment.”

Clients are willing to pay thousands of dollars for 
these services, which include companionship, 
meditation, and the doula’s constant phrases of 
affirmation and comfort. The expanding market for 
end-of-life doulas reveals the gaping hole left by the 
medical system when it comes to death. 

And yet end-of-life doulas face a long road ahead 
before they become a household name. Their 
obscurity arises not just from the fact that the clients 
of death doulas can’t posthumously make referrals, 
but also due to the lack of nationwide standardization. 
While nurses and doctors must pass standardized 
exams in order to earn a license, death doulas aren’t 
licensed. Instead, they may attend one of dozens 
of different training options and take an online 
exam, which costs $115, to earn a proficiency badge 
from the National End-of-Life Doula Alliance. The 
organization’s website stresses that “families can know 
that an end-of-life doula who has earned a NEDA 
Proficiency Badge has met certain standards,” called 
“Core Competencies.” These standards include basic 
values such as professionalism, technical knowledge, 
and communication. The National End-of-Life Doula 
Alliance’s mission is to increase awareness about 
and popularize this profession across the country. 
Currently, not every doula training program or

doula falls under the umbrella of this organization. 
Realistically, the standardization of end-of-life doula 
practices won’t be easy. Each doula has their own 
approach to treatments, whether it’s meditation or 
legal assistance, and a doula’s expertise arises from 
experience and practice in the field, something that 
can’t be evaluated on an exam. 

Additionally, being an end-of-life doula is not a 
full-time job. Five of nine end-of-life doulas in 
Connecticut don’t have a full roster of clients likely 
because most people have not heard of their services. 
“Nobody makes a living being a death doula yet,” 
Bonafé said. Bonafé works as a landlord, Harrison 
pet-sits, and McCullough works in a hospice. Doula 
Jill Bowens works at Quinnipiac University as an 
administrative assistant while starting a private doula 
practice. “The goal is to phase out of my nine-to-five 
and spend the last retirement years of my life as an 
end-of-life doula, doing this work as long as I can,” 
said Bowens. 

For now, Bonafé mentors younger doulas like 
Bowens and makes sure that each visitor to her death 
cafe is received with open arms. Six months ago, at the 
July death cafe, Bonafé noticed a newcomer—Susan 
Clark. Her vibrant red hair and stories made her 
unforgettable to Bonafé, as Clark opened up about 
her sister’s death during discussion. “She was sharing 
in a very beautiful way,” Bonafé recounted. “And then 
magic happened.”

At each subsequent cafe, Bonafé noticed that Clark 
smiled a little more. At the next cafe, Clark brought 
in a framed photograph of Joe, Clark’s sister, taken 
in Hawaii days before her death. Eyes obscured by 
sunglasses, Joe wore a t-shirt emblazoned with turtles, 
a parrot balanced on each shoulder. Joe adored turtles 
and had adopted two from a shelter, Clark told the 
group. At the October death cafe, Clark was the last 
to speak.

“We’re tenacious for life,” Clark said. “We don’t 
want to give it up. It wasn’t in her control. It was her 
time to go. I probably will be fighting with her forever 
for leaving though.” 

As the cafe wrapped up, participants zipped rain 
jackets and returned mugs. People slipped into the 
rainy night, on solitary walks or drives back home, 
just as quickly as they gathered.
