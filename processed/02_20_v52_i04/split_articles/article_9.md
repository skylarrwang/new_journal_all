THE  NEW  JOURNAL
I
t’s noon at the call center at the New 
Haven 
Police 
Station. 
The 
operators, 
dispatchers, and supervisors are visible less 
by the ceiling lights, yellow and dim, than by the 
white glare that monitors cast upon their faces. 
These screens are everywhere: three or four per 
person, each with a different spreadsheet or alarm 
system, while another larger screen dominates the 
wall, displaying the names of officers on duty. A TV 
tuned to the news plays silently overhead; no one is 
watching it. A supervisor holds two phones, one for 
each ear, and simultaneously yells information to a 
dispatcher across the room. By the wall, an operator 
stops mid-sentence to answer an incoming call, then 
another; traffic starts to pick up. An active shooter, a 
fire, a panicked mother to be talked through CPR. 
The rapid speech of a dozen-odd employees fills 
the shadowed room. From time to time a joke is 
thrown into the mix, and a short laugh sends a voice 
flying. But always within seconds, that professional 
tone—any call-taker’s best asset—returns to calm a 
desperate caller.


This is a standard day for the New Haven 
Public 
Safety 
Communications 
Department, 
which is responsible for managing the thousands 
of emergencies that flare up across the city daily. 
Although an employee’s duties can differ throughout 
the week, new hires generally begin as operators. 
Known more colloquially as call-takers, their job is 
to handle the initial calls, from the mundane to the 
dire, of those in distress. Senior operators may be 
assigned to the post of dispatcher, coordinating fire, 
police, or ambulance responses to the emergency 
situation. Overseeing all of this are the supervisors, 
typically long-time dispatchers, who watch the list of 
held calls to ensure there is no backlog. The entire 
effort is facilitated by the director of the department, 
George Peet, who has been here since 1997. Each 
morning these employees, many of whom have been 
here as long as Peet has, must wake up and steel 
themselves in whatever way possible for a fresh batch 
of crises.
