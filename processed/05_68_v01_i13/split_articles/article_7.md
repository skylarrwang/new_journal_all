storming the citadels of the Union of 
South Africa, such an assumptio'! makes 
sense. In the United States such an as-
sumption, I believe, i~seJf-defeating for 
the cause of Black Power. White America 
will neither grant total power nor even, as 
Carmichael has claimed, turn over the 
control of our major cities exclusively to 
black Americans, even where the latter 
constitute a numerical majority, 

While Black Power spokesmen have 
some capacity for triggering violence, they 
have very little apparent ability to control 
or direct it. Lenin, a successful revolution-
ist, had a profound understanding of the 
tendency of violence to achieve a momen-
tum of its own, frighteningly free from the 
control of those who set it in motion. 

It seems to me crucial for Black Power 
advocates to worry about this problem. 
At the risk of offending those Black Power 
spokesmen who insist on borrowing noth-
ingfrom European history, I would argue 
that Lenin's What Is To Be Done? might 
be fruitful reading. Certainly much more 
fruitful than Frantz Fanon, who may have 
much that is relevant to say to oppressed 
majorities in the Third World but precious 
little for black Americans confronted by 
a white power structure. 

Black Power leaders also severely mis-
interpret the nature of the power structure 
in America's major cities. It is now a cliche 
to read that Harlem, Roxbury and Watts 
are simply "colonial" areas exploited by 
the white power-holders. But the exploita-
tion of blacks, politically and economical-
ly, is also a collusion between the "white 
power structure" and some "black 
brothers." The notion that all black 
Americans are brothers and therefore 
dedicated to revolutionary change is ab-
solutely fatal for a program designed to 
inculcate a sense of political self-
sufficiency. There are two goals in con-
flict here. To achieve a sense of identity 
and self-respect in opposition to the 
"hooky" community requires, I think, the 
concept that all black Americans are 
brothers; to achieve revolutionary change 
requires that Black Power leaders consider 
which black Americans-in Harlem, Rox-
bury, Watts or South ChicagQ-\'Ihould be 
"taken out of play." 

The sense of helpless dependency must 
be ended. This requires not merely 
hostility toward ameliorative programs 
conceived and administered by whites but 
also a bard-nosed look at what in the 
black community itself plays into the 
bands of a white-determined racism. I 
find the Black Power literature singularly 
lacking in such calculations. 

Although many whites and most "Great 
Society" advocates like to think that fi-
nancial efforts to alleviate social and 
economic distress have been massive, the 
President's Commission on Civil Dis-
orders notes that they have barely. 
scratched the surface. "For the Negro 
family in the urban ghetto," tbe Com-
mission notes, "the future seems to lead 
only to a dead-end .... New methods of 
escape must be found for the majority of 
today's poor" (p. 282). 

To meet the emergency, existing gov-
ernmental machinery will not suffice, and 
new arrangements must be tried. In its 
broad outlines, my proposal involves an 
immediate general appropriation of two 
billion dollars. The funds would be 
primarily earmarked for cities with a 
high-riot-potential profile. Most of the 
cities where Negroes constitute more than 
ten percent of the population would fall 
into this category. Almost all of the thirty 
largest cities would qualify. 

The funds would be used to create jobs 
for the-underemployed and unemployed 
young, male Negroes of the ghettos. The 
projects providing such employment op-
portunities would be cQosen by the young 
people themselves in conjunction with 
older leadership in the ghettos. As much 
as possible, federal funds would be chan-
neled through an emergency administra-
tion-perhaps a Department of National 
Urban Survival--directly to those at the 
urban level who would spenp (not "ad-
minister'') such funds. This pattern would 
involve not merely reaching around state 
governments, which the national govern-
ment is already quite expert at doing, but 
circumventing existing local governmental 
units as well. 

Community..development and anti-
poverty agencies should probabty con-
tinue to function, but only with the 
understanding that they are not in any 
way to interfere with the emergency NUS 
program. It would be the responsibility 
of other agencies concerned with the gen-
eral problem not to have their programs 
delay, water down, divert or subvert the 
NUS end-in-view. "Co-ordination" is a 
typical subverting or at least delaying 
word and must be shunned. 

Whites would have as little as possib~e 
to do with this program. This means that 
ghetto-wide or ghetto-neighborhood or-
ganizations (public corporations if neces-
sary) would receive funds, perhaps on the 
basis of a simple head count or the ratio 
of persons to units of living space or the 
mean number of rat bites per month over 
the last five years. The data are easily at 
hand; no further investigation or research 
is needed to discover "relevant" criteria. 

How would the funds be used? Frankly, 
I don't know. The general guideline is that 
use is to be determined indigenously, as 
I indicated above. My assumption is that 
no one knows better than ghetto residents 
what has high priority, what they want 
and what they do not want. At all cost, 
what "they" need must not be determined 
by what "we" think is best, or feasible. 

Some neighborhood groups may want 
to renovate existing residential structures. 
If doing so requires that slumlords be dis-
possessed, I would argue that eminent 
domain has in our history been used for 
less worthy and less humane causes. If 
another group wants to demolish dan-
gerous, rat-infested tenements, local 
authorities should seek to facilitate this. 

Would the money be "spent well"? 
From one or more vantage points, prob-
ably not. Americans who have been 
deprived in every sense of that word may 
be expected to Jack myriad technical, 
occupational, administrative and related 
skills. There would without doubt be 
waste, inefficiency, errors that would look 
silly and avoidable to "reasonable" men. 
In some cases there would also be venality, 
corruption or downright exploitation of 
black by black. Why should it be different 
in an America where the gap between 
what we preach and what we do is agoniz-
ingly apparent even to tt.e most illiterate 
child of the ghetto? 

Consider, too, how strikingly selective 
we are about identifying and condemning 
what we call waste and inefficiency. Three 
airplanes scarcely off the drawing boards 
are sent to Vietnam for "tests," and in 
the space of a few weeks the country is 
out about 25 million dollars. If our news-
papers are correct, we are as a nation cur-
