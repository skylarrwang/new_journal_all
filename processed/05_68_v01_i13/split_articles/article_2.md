On Monday, April 15, I entered St. 
Michael's Hall, the polling place for New 
Haven's Second Ward. I intended to 
vote for Adam Parry and Billie Salter, 
the Reform candidates for Democratic 
committeemen in my ward. What followed 
was not the simple minute in the voting 
booth, but a two-hour nightmare with 
Kafkaesque characters and special effects 
by Boss Tweed. 


I called out my name loudly to a very 
bored poll-watcher until he eventually 
found it among the hazy purple lines of 
the "supplementary list" of registrants-
a convenient roll of students who reg-
istered during the McCarthy campaign. 
"Well, I'll have to challenge you," he 
yawned. I asked for an explanation, but 
the forlorn look on the face of a Reform 
poll-watcher told me that I was asking 
too much. A pencil directed me to another 
table, where the almighty moderator 
reigned. 

"Why can't I vote?" I asked a short 
man who looked frightened in spite of his 
authoritarian manners. "Ya gotta have 
an affidavit," answered Albert Annun-
ziata, lawyer for the city of New Haven, 
machine-tender for a day and "acting" 
moderator when the real moderator was 
out of the room. My relationship with Mr. 
Annunziata was destined to be brief 
and ugly. 

I told him that it would be impossible 
to get an affidavit, since City Hall had 
already closed, but he was unimpressed. 
He mumbled a few words and then told 
me to get out. I told Annunziata that he 
was out of his mind if he thought he could 
prevent me from voting, and I remember 
that I made some unfortunate remarks 
about Ross Barnett and Al Capone. 

"Sheriff," Annunziata said, "take care 
of this guy." Before I could say anything, 
I was being pushed out of the room by a 
squat man in a gold sport coat-the 
sheriff. I later learned that in the course 
of the day more than thirty people had 
been evicted by Annunziata's enforcers. 

But I returned, armed this time with an 
affidavit supplied by a law student. I 
managed to confront Robert Adelman, 
the "real" moderator, who immediately 
rejected my pink registration slip. After a 
few minutes of intense discussion, he 
blandly said that I could vote. The ever-
vigilant Annunziata protested, but to no 
avail. As I left the room there was a long 
line of students waiting to vote. At eight 
o'clock, when the polls closed, twenty still 
stood in the darkened corridors of St. 
Michael's. 

Testimony offered in a Superior Court 
hearing afterward confirmed the worst 
fears of the voters who witnessed the 
events of April 15. Annunziata, Adelman 
and their assistants challenged every single 
voter whose name appeared on the supple-
mentary list and forced nearly all of them 
to leave the polling place to find new 
"evidence" of residency. When checkers 
for the Reform slate challenged a few 
voters on the permanent list, the mod-
erator approved them immediately. 

Annunziata, in spite of his lowly status 
as a machine tender, wielded dictatorial 
power over a system elaborately designed 
to insure democracy. Not only were the 
sheriffs at his beck and call, but moderator 
Adelman, who was supposed to have 
supreme authority over all disputes, acted 
as his lackey. Paula Busch testified before 
the Superior Court hearing that she heard 
Annunziata say to Adelman: "You're 
letting these people vote. You shouldn't. 
The worst thing I ever did was give you 
this job. You ought to take a walk." Mr. 
Adelman took a number of walks during 
the day, and so did Annunziata, whose 
excursions often led him into the voting 
booth-a criminal offense. On one mem-
orable occasion both Adelman and An-
nunziata were absent, making it possible 
for John Santagata, the Machine can-
didate, to act as moderator. 

The voting rights of many graduate 
students have been suspended for some 
time-not by statute but by a registrar's 
"ruling" which prohibits anyone living in 
university housing from registering in 
New Haven. But the obstructionism prac-
ticed in the Second Ward has been the 
most blatant example of discrimination 
against students witnessed thus far. In 
fact, the Democratic officials may be sub-
ject to prosecution under the Civil Rights 
Act of 1965 for systematically discrim-
inating against a certain class of people. 

Lawyers retained by Arthur Barbieri's 
town committee have already stated that 
students are "transients" and should not 
be allowed to vote. In the first day of the 
hearing at Superior Court, Hartford at-
torney Alexander Goldfarb convinced 
the court that the relevant election law 
(which he drafted) does not offer legal 
relief for citizens who have been deprived 
of the right to vote. In other words, even 
if the aggrieved voters win their case, the 
court has ruled that it cannot order a new 
election. Goldfarb has argued further that 
the twenty disfranchised students have no 
grounds for complaint because, due to the 
registrar's blunders, all of the voters en-
rolled since October are ineligible. The 
judge who is hearing the case noted that 
Goldfarb's argument is of "some sub-
stance." 

The Machine is frightened by the six-
teen hundred new voters who registered 
during the McCarthy campaign. Arthur 
Barbieri's April 15 experiment in dis-
franchising these students yielded some 
tangible results. In addition to the twenty 
students who were kept waiting until the 
polls closed, an undetermined number 
of challenged voters did not return to the 
polls. Billie Salter, the Reform candidate 
for committeewoman, lost by eighteen 
votes. Attempts to disfranchise new voters 
will continue unless sufficient protest is 
raised in the press and at City Hall. Thus 
far the New Haven papers and news 
broadcasters have ignored the hearing or 
slanted their reports, and Mayor Lee has 
been compliantly silent about the whole 
affair. 

Further legal action will be taken. Con-
tributions will be accepted by Maynard 
Mack, Jr., 131 Dwight Street.
