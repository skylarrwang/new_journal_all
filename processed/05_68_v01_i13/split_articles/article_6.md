The group we expect to see on center 
stage this summer has been carefully de-
lineated by the President's Cohimissio~ on 
Civil Disorders. Young people fiftee,n to 
nineteen years old constitute ob.Iy a' small 
minority of any American city; but as the 
events Of Memphis illustrate, they ~an 
quickly turn peacefill demonstrations into 
violence artd chaos and the mood of the 
countr~ into one of fear and demand•for 
order. History wiU demonstrate that" 
clamorous' public demands for law and 
order are often invitlitions to a drastic 
constriction of human freedoms. 

These young, people of the dation's 
racial ghettos combine the resentment and 
anta~onisrrl of the acutely deprived with 
the cynicism and open hostility that people 
under thirty typically feel toward existing 
institutions and mores. Unless we find 
effective ways of responding-to ~ese 
youths, no program we can design to 
ameliorate our domestic illness will prove 
very salutary. 

I cannot predict with confidence how 
students of the Enlightenment will assess a 
macabre national calc'ulus where the life 
of a Martin Luther King equals the pas-.. 
sage of an open-housing law . .Although it 
appears that we may permit violence itself' 
to remain the primary stimulus to cor-
rective action, 1 will suggest an emergency 
program for our cities' youth. But in 
discussing the necessary role of Black 
Power (the hope of some) and White 
Power (an oppressive reality for many) in 
such a program, I am impelled to respond 
to the signals I get from Black Power 
spokesmen. 

First; I fully agree with Stokely Car-
michael,' who holds that it is fatuous for 
whites and self-defeating for black 
Americans to expect that a racist America 
will solve its problems if everyone plays 
by white rules. I am fundamentally guided 
by Barrington Moore's suggestion that 
since white Americans don't believe in 
their 6wn rules anyway, we must view with 
"relentless skepticism" all suggestions that 
anything is better than violence. 

Second, I am a white racist in a racist 
America, in both senses of racism that 
Carmichael and Hamilton identify in 
Black Power (pp. 3-6). I have personally 
inflicted violence on black Americans. As 
a child of a Negro-Italian-Jewish ghetto 
I participated in frequent (though rarely 
fatal) skirmishes, the "rumbles" of the 
depression years. When Italians and Jews 
were not fighting each other, they were 
attacking, or being attacked by, the com-
mon "enemy." Some of my gleefully or 
angrily burled bricks found their target. 

I am also a racist in the second sense 
suggested by Carmichael and Hamilton. 
I have personally been guilty of what 
they call "institutional racism" by con-
tinuing to support or acquiesce to a num-
ber of American political, industrial and 
commercial organizations that tend to 
perpetuate a subjugated status for black 
Americans. Like Other white liberals I 
have tried to expiate this guilt by sending 
money to jailed civil rights workers in 
Mississippi or by marching in Alabama. 

My first reactions to Black Power were 
patronizing. How, I thought, can anyone 
hope to organize a political movement if 
Joseph LaPalombara is a professor of 
political science. 
he has not carefully spelled out an 
ideology? When black Americans spoke 
to me of violence, I wanted to know the 
ends for which they expected violence to 
function. I thought that as long as I did 
not in fact exclude violence as a political 
instrument, I could establish a dialogue, 
could participate not only in clarifying 
but (alas!) perhaps in helping to shape the 
thinking and the strategy of Black Power 
advocates. It took time and a number 
of frank exchanges to show me that I. too, 
was asking black Americans to play the 
political power game by white American 
,rules. There was no difference at all be- · 
tween my asking Black Power advocates 
or leaders to tell me what their i~eology 
might be and the harassed and confused 
New Haven business community's asking 
"the leaders of the Black Boycott to tell 
them specifically what they wanted. 

In my frank exchanges, I dipped into 
history, drawing the obvious analogy 
between the anti-ideological posture of 
Black Power advocates, white American 
drop-outs, hippies and New Leftists on the 
one hand, and the nihilist movements that 
engulfed the 'European continent between 
the wars on the other. Whatever the merits 
of that analogy, I missed the point that it 
was my white America I wished to pre-
serve for political degeneration and that 
for most black Americans it made little 
difference where nihilistic behavior might 
lead on a continuum of freedom or 
slavery, democracy or totalitarianism. The 
first white American who seems to me to 
understand this fully and perhaps to 
provide a compelling rationale for non-
ideological violent behavior is Norman 
Mailer. What he tells us in his brilliant 
article "The Steps of the Pentagon" is that 
after violence our society will not be what 
it was before violence. I am persuaded 
that for many of the people of our black 
ghettos that assurance is enough: preach-
ing about the "insanity" of burning their 
own rat-infested firetraps will find fewer 
and fewer black listeners. 

For some time I was also uncritically in 
favor of accelerated occupational integra-
tion, busing, open housing, liberalized 
admission policies in higher education 
and so forth. It was difficult to agree with 
black Americans who opposed the bleed-
ing-off of leadership from the ghettos, the 
creation of a spurious black middle class or 
elite, the increasingly forced implementa· 
tion of equal opportunity policies. I still 
favor much of this, but I must recognize 
that such advocacy is inconsistent with the 
first sociology I learned twenty-five years 
ago. That sociology taught me that 
America bas two stratification systems 
and that whatever may be the number of 
"life chances" society awards the Negro, 
he never gets out of the black stratification 
system and into the white system because 
white Americans will not permit this. The 
"assimilation hypothesis" was and remains 
wishful and erroneous. 

Where, then, do I differ with some of 
the Black Power leaders? 

First, notwithstanding the history of 
slavery and of the years since "emancipa-
tion," I fear that many black leaders 
grossly underestimate white America's 
capacity for violent and repressive reac-
tion. These leaders seem much more adept 
at estimating how much resistance to their 
strategies they are bound to find in the 
black ghettos. Their strategies seem ap-
propriate when the revolutionary group 
intends to wrest total power and bas some 
prospect of doing so. When Stokely 
Carmichael writes about black Africans
