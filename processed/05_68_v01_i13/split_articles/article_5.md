Woe to him who seeks to please rather 
than to appal-Moby-Dick 

Through the work of Norman Mailer, 
undulating rhythmically like the stripes in 
an American fiag, run the white river of 
magic and the red river of history. Magic 
until now bas been in the ascendent, the 
incantatory exorcisms of An American 
Dream and Why Are We In Vietnam? 
But the latter also foretells "The Steps 
of the Pentagon" and "The Battle of the 
Pentagon" in that curious and complex 
interconnection that makes Mailer's work 
so endlessly rich in new perspectives and 
revisitings. The magical aromas of An 
American Dream, that denial of 
mechanism and technology in the praise 
of individual vitality, diffuse their fume 
through Why Are We In Vietnam? But 
while Stephen Richards Rojack, the hero 
of An American Dream, can retreat to 
barbarous Guatemala, D.J., the hero of 
Why Are We In Vietnam?, must finally 
go to "civilized" Vietnam, must emerge 
from his resonant consciousness to meet 
the cruder realities of war and time, out 
of his knowledge of human loss in the 
passage to manhood to confront the 
perpetrators of those bankrupt values. 

Confrontation is the essence of these 
two new works by Mailer, published by 
New American Library as The Armies 
of Night. In ''The Steps of the Pentagon" 
(much the better of the two) he constructs 
the most elaborate of those stand-ins for 
himself with which he has manipulated the 
outrage of readers ever since the nice, 
talented, sweet Jewish boy who wrote The 
Naked and the Dead fell into disrepair. In 
his journalism be frequently cast himself 
as a character to gain perspective from the 
impersonal third person "one." Monstrous 
egotism, complained the bridegrooms of 
objectivity, who saw the basis of their 
insidious bias being slowly eroded. But 
"one" remained and spawned his epigoni; 
bred on Mailer's pieces about the Clay-
Liston fight and the 1964 Republican 
Convention, who could really call Gay 
Talese and Tom Wolfe the Fathers of the 
New Journalism? 

But Mailer moves on. For each occasion 
a new and apt style, sometimes more 
successful, sometimes less. But each time 
he attempts what most contemporary 
writers with any pretence to stature do 
not: to grapple with new events and new 
ideas and to forge a new method to deal 
with them. In "The Steps of the Pentagon" 
he once again molds a new and 
appropriate style, sounding new themes, 
elaborating old ones. 

The peculiar triumph of "The Steps of 
the Pentagon" is Mailer's ability to make 
"Mailer"- "Lyndon Johnson's dwarf 
alter ego"- an appropriate figure to 
place at the center of events, although in 
actual importance he is only on the 
periphery. "Mailer" is immediately "your 
protagonist," a being whom the narrator 
can manipulate for his own ends. He is not 
unlike one of those passive heroes who 
occupy the centers of novels by Sir Walter 
Scott, unimportant in the streams of public 
uo Braudy is an instructor in English. 
history, a kind of a glass through which 
the "great" events can be seen in some 
perspective, to be either accepted or 
rejected. Like these characters, "Mailer" 
is frequently a comic butt. He is accorded 
various epithets-"the Beast," "the 
Existentialist," "the Ruminant," "the 
Participant." In the early parts of the 
piece, Mailer also participates in mock-
epic exploits like his account of Thursday 
night in the Ambassador theater (the 
secJion that he re.ad to an audience here 
at the Law School). 

Old Mailer-mockers are used to this 
self-display. But Mailer, like Falstaff, 
abides our questions. Whatever we can 
say about him he has already said better 
about himself. The figure of "Mailer" is 
entirely appropriate for the occasion; 
Mailer says that he is "a comic hero" and 
there is need "that he should be an egotist 
of the most startling misproportions." 

And what if he actually is this way? Does 
the work succeed as literature? Has this 
staging of the self been transmuted into 
art? "Write about what you know," advise 
the sages; and if Mailer can thereby write 
Â· about himself with that incessantly saving 
self-consciousness, why complain? By 
centering a work that deals with a 
historical event around a character much 
like himself, Mailer the narrator gives us a 
simultaneous sense of the event in both 
prospect and retrospect, in the 
contingencies and comic inanities of the 
moment and with the full weight of 
interpretive and abstract pronouncements. 

When Mailer threatens to be overabstract 
or "Mailer" threatens to be petty and 
egotistical, his opposite number restores 
the balance. In himself be compounds the 
comic exuberance of Falstaff with the 
shrewd political sense of Prince Hal. 

"Everyman his own historian," said Carl 
Becker. But he had not seen Mailer 
walking chunkily suave in the Washington 
sun. 

For those who might still protest, it 
must be said that this work is no transcript. 
"Mailer" is frequently ignorant, while 
Mailer is all-knowing. Mailer includes 
documents that deserve preservation, 
while "Mailer" crumples them up and 
tosses them into the nearest wastepaper 
basket or gutter. Mike Holahan, Peter 
Rose, Dave Thorburn and I walked with 
Mailer from the First United 
Congregational Church of Christ to the 
Church of the Reformation, but no 
"Holahan," "Rose," "Thorburn" or 
"Braudy" appears (although John Boyles, 
Gordon Rogoff and of course the Rev. 
Coffin are heavily represented). The two-
hour walk is quenched in a dependent 
clause: " ... and then walked a greater 
distance to the second church .... " 

Further treatment is irrelevant. Mailer has 
his esthetic ends in view, even if "Mailer" 
does not know them. 

Now that I have introduced a personal 
note of my own into the pseudo-objectivity 
of a book review, let me say that for 
someone who was present those days, the 
great achievement of "The Steps of the 
Pentagon" and its "comic hero" is its 
ability to convey the sense that we all must 
have felt of being present at an important 
historical moment, yet still bound by 
our immediate selves, without perspective, 
without a larger, more comprehensive 
judgment. Here was the problem of the 
act itself: to make such a private 
commitment to what we believed moral 
and just, and yet to be so uncertain of its 
public effects, its larger mean~g. ~ere 
does the individual intersect wtth hiStory? 
How does he dare to lie athwart its 
necessitous and plodding rampage? The 
two Mailers offer some answer to this 
question because they embody a literary 
technique passionately wed to the 
uncertainties of the situation itself. The 
"Mailer" who occupies the center of our 
vision is as stumbling apd imperceptive, as 
niggardly and self-dramatizing, in his 
worst and best moments, as ourselves. But 
he does act. And the grandeur of his act is 
enhanced by the humanity, the frailty he 
asserts while he acts. In some basic way 
that William Wordsworth would have 
appreciated, "Mailer" focuses our 
fragmented sense of ourselves before 
implacable history and bridges the human 
gap between our principles and our 
actions, our high-minded idealism and our 
actual egoism. The poet, the writer, is 
more intense but still palpably a man. 

"The Steps of the Pentagon" puts the 
individual into history, faces his confusion 
with its immensity. Yet there is another 
kind of history that stands behind Mailer's 
work, a history that he hopes can be 
realized to purge the more malevolent 
and impersonal history the events of that 
weekend in October tried to stop. This 
history is a history of the mind, of the 
makers of American literature. Behind the 
public history of October 20-22, Mailer 
frequently projects a diorama of the Civil 
War, the shadow of its bloody battles 
shrouding the events of those days in giant 
images from Matthew Brady photographs, 
looming over the not very distant vista of 
Bull Run. But behind the private history 
of "Norman Mailer" caught up in these 
events broods another American history, a 
histpry that celebrates individual power 
and creativity, the history of the 
Transcendentalist, of Emerson, Thoreau, 
Whitman, and later of Fitzgerald, Wolfe 
and Hemingway, invoked as a 
counterpoint -
a better self -
to the 
grotesque that America bad become. The 
figure of Robert Lowell bodies the 
presence of that lost New England cultural 
heritage, that dammed-up integrity; and 
perhaps one source of Mailer's third 
person may be The Education of Henry 
Adams. All of Mailer's remarks fit into 
such a framework of value. One history 
may confuse and thwart the individual; 
the other can redeem him. Even such 
seemingly incidental remarks as Mailer's 
condemnation of LSD are absorbed into 
this vision: the drug is bad because it "rips 
holes in the past," and Mailer fears that the 
past will too readily be consumed by the 
present. 

"The Steps of the Pentagon" is a moving 
and brilliant piece of writing. ''The Battle 
of the Pentagon" is much less successful. 
It is a thorough account of both the 
preparations for the March of October 22 
and the March itself that concentrates 
primarily on the efforts of Dave Dellinger 
to balance the demands of established 
peace groups on one side and California-
oriented militants on the other. Passing 
from "Mailer," the amateur actor in the 
play of history, we have come to Dellinger, 
the professional, who must frequently 
compromise his own fervent principles in 
order to placate one faction or another. 
"The Battle of the Pentagon" minutely 
catches the bone-crushing demands on 
Dellinger's time and diplomatic skills in 
the radical arena. But the prose is stolid 
and unusually lusterless. The tone is 
objective; passive verbs have taken over 
even from the impersonal "one."
