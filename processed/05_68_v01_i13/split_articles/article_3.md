**Title: At home with David Levine**
**Author: Jonathan Aaron**
**Page number(s): 3**

David Levine, the painter and caricaturist, 
lives near Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza, where, if you don't know your Brooklyn, 
you are astonished by the sunlight that is 
unimpeded by tall buildings or soot. The 
Plaza Parkway moves around a small 
etoile, at the center of which is an arch 
of triumph honoring the Union Army. 

Levine's house is one of the many brown-
stones that line the nearby side-streets. 
On an oval brass plate the name Levine 
was etched in a worn, elegant script. 

Levine answered the door and led me into 
his quietly lit livingroom, where there was 
just light enough to see the parquet of the 
floor. The house was spacious, though not 
unusually large. It was a place for elegant 
loafing, perhaps. 

We stopped for a moment in his third-
floor study. By a window overlooking 
the street was a heavy desk covered with 
photographs of Bobby Kennedy. Like so 
many hostile Indians, the photographs 
encircled a half-finished caricature. 

Small pen-and-ink drawings covered the 
mantelpiece. Over it hung a large, active 
painting of an aerial view of London. 
"It may be by Turner," said Levine, "but 
I haven't found out for sure yet. It was in 
his studio when he died. But the sky isn't 
his," he explained, "it's been painted 
over." 

On the fourth floor was the large, 
sunny studio where Levine paints. Like 
his study one floor below, it was prac-
tically unfurnished, save for some chairs, 
a couple of tables and some unfinished 
oils. The broad wall facing the stairway 
was covered with small oils and water-
colors. You had the impression that in 
order for Levine either to paint or draw, 
he had to be as free from the clutter of 
daily objects as possible. 

These days Levine is probably the most 
famous caricaturist of political and literary 
persons in the country. For several years 
his acerbic visual commentaries have 
been appearing in Esquire and The New 
York Review of Books, as well as in other 
publications such as Look, Atlas and The 
Washington Post. His drawings are so 
surgically precise, so uncompromisingly 
iconoclastic, that it's a surprise to 
find that Levine is not a withered troll 
mysteriously chastised years ago by the 
gods, not a Loki with a poison pen, but an 
urbane, smiling, good-looking man of 
forty-two who is first and foremost a suc-
cessful representational painter, and a 
caricaturist, as it turns out, strictly by 
accident. 

His black hair and prominent nose give 
him a slightly Latin look, and seeing him 
in the street, you might think he was 
Spanish if you didn't know he was 
Jewish. He looks a little like the retired 
Argentine auto-racing champion, Juan 
Fangio. He isn't stout, but he gives an 
impression of solidity, of good-humored 
yet wary contentment. 

We sat down and began to talk into a 
small tape recorder that whistled and 
squawked. He spoke briefly of growing 
up in Brooklyn, of going to Erasmus High 
School and then to the Tyler School of 
Art at Temple University. His father was 
until recently a dress manufacturer in the 
garment district, and it is to this part of his 
past that Levine returns constantly in his 
painting. 

The world of the garment workers is 
dying, he feels, and despite his faint tone 
of self-mockery, he spoke with a sense of 
mission about preserving details of the 
garment industry in his painting. He ges-
tured toward a large, unfinished oil, called 
"The Presser," on an easel in the middle 
of the room. The painting showed a thin, 
elderly man at an ironing board. He was 
naked to the waist, suspenders fallen 
along his rather baggy trousers, and his 
back was turned to you. He conveyed age, 
dignity, loneliness and grace. 

Levine is also preoccupied with Coney 
Island, another dying world, and he 
pointed to the small water-colors on the 
wall near him. They were scenes of ghostly 
roller-coasters, of empty boardwalk shops, 
whose signs and marquees speak to few 
people any more. 

"I follow a very traditional kind of 
painting," he said, "simply because I want 
to talk to an audience which hangs its 
own mental hat on verisimilitude." He 
particularly admires Degas and Toulouse-
Lautrec, and he speaks almost lovingly of 
Eakins. He describes his own painting not 
with the glib precision of someone who 
has decided what his problems should 
sound like to admirers, but with a be-
mused, sometimes hesitant informality 
that makes clear his continual search for 
a better understanding of even the most 
familiar issues. He seems a man bored by 
few things in life. 

"I'm interested in a broadly understood 
statement which makes somebody say, 
'Well, that's a pretty corny statement; that 
doesn't mean anything to me,' or else, 'Oh, 
that touches on something.' 

"I'd like, for instance, to establish some-
thing about the beach-I paint the beach a 
lot. If people can no longer come to a 
beach without seeing through my eyes to 
some degree, then I have touched on some-
thing." 

He finds in beach crowds "a whole 
visible expression of society." His paint-
ings, even those in which no human being 
is visible, are about people. "I try to select 
things which I look on as healthy-for 
instance, people in the [garment] shops .... 
In our society a man produces something 
which is a contribution, but which is never 
thought of as a contribution; it's just a 
job .... He has no societal role. Take 
'The Presser.' When people in the gar-
ment industry see this, it makes them 
think: 'Oh. There are very few of them 
left.' As soon as I pointed it up, they may 
be able then to go and look on other jobs 
and say, 'Look: those four women lined 
up working, look at the sense of rhythm 
there. I saw it in a painting.' There's an 
innate beauty in just living which you can 
sharpen and make more perceptible for 
people." 

Levine keeps painting and cartooning 
separate, but not entirely from choice. 
"I don't think painting has to do with 
direct, topical, political themes. That tends 
to have been the weakest aspect of painting 
in the thirties. Men tended to make politi-
cal caricatures and mistook them for 
paintings of a social nature. I am very 
happy to have this [caricaturing] as an 
outlet, because I am a very political-
oriented person." He smiled and ex-
plained, "My mother is a Stalinist, and my 
aunt is a Maoist, and between the two of 
them they call me a Trotskyite." 

Levine started drawing occasional 
caricatures for Esquire seven or eight years 
ago at the prompting of Clay Felker, then 
articles editor of the magazine. For Levine 
it was strictly a lark, but when The New 
York Review of Books began to run his 
drawings regularly in 1963, he found him-
self at the start of a career that nowadays 
leaves him less than half of his time for 
painting. He follows a flexible but demand-
ing schedule. "I do about ten drawings a 
month for The New York Review, one 
drawing a month for The Washington 
Post, two drawings a month for Look 
magazine, six or seven drawings a month 
for Esquire, and whatever else comes 
through." 

He has always drawn cartoons, and as a 
boy he wanted to become a comic-book 
illustrator. Enthusiastically, he remembers 
a favorite boyhood magazine, Will Eisner's 
The Spirit, but he points out quickly that 
comic book illustrating was "a dead end." 
The only artist who successfully escaped 
the comics was Levine's close friend 
Jules Peiffer, who illustrated a strip called 
"Clifford" in the back pages of The Spirit. 
It was here that Levine discovered Peiffer's 
work, long before Peiffer got his first real 
break after giving away cartoons to The 
Village Voice. 

Yet the comic book, Levine believes, 
never really had a chance. Irresponsible 
entrepreneurs used it for commercial pur-
poses that had nothing to do with its 
artistic potential. 

We returned to the subject of his carica-
tures. Asked if he had a favorite target, 
Levine thought for a moment and replied, 
grinning again over folded hands, "Him 
Who Is In Power." He elaborated. "There 
was a time in my more 'participant-left' 
days when I would have been protective of 
left-wing people, but that's not what I 
would do today. I think that bureaucrats 
and politicians and power-wielders, on any 
side, in any government, just simply have 
to be constantly criticized in order to keep 
them straight." Levine would, he admitted 
frankly, "go after anybody that they [his 
editors] will ask for"-a statement which 
possibly contradicts his belief that drawing 
is "a highly personalized expression" of 
belief. At the same time, however, carica-
turing seems to be a supra-personal activity 
for him, as it was for Thomas Nast or 
Honore Daumier. 

When drawing a caricature, Levine 
works from photographs, which he collects 
by the dozens. "Most of the planning," he 
said, "goes into selecting the photograph, 
and the rendering in pen and ink. The 
penciling, which comes first, goes very 
quickly. I did a drawing of Jules Peiffer 
last night for Ramparts in about an hour 
and a half." He concentrates on the head 
of his subject and on physical idiosyn-
crasies ("long fingers, clubby-looking 
hands"; remember the nose of LBJ) or on 
characteristic clothing ("Harold Wilson's 
collars"). 

In his drawing, Levine pushes the be-
lievable as far as it will go before it plunges 
into an abyss of overstatement. "If my 
caricatures become too brutal in their 
chopping-up of somebody's appearance," 
he remarked, "you lose the point of what 
I have to say." 

He added that, on the other hand, some 
caricatures are blunted by the very persons 
or ideologies they are out to expose. 
"There is a built-in contradiction in caricature," he said. For example, "A so-called 
socially involved artist will make up some 
horrendous work about the condition of 
man, only to find it's being purchased 
as a lovely decoration for somebody's 
living room. There is a tendency in car-
