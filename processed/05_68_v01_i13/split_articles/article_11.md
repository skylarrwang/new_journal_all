Festival, she made Bonnie and Clyde, her 
first film. Last summer she played a school-
teacher with a lesbian attraction to 
Joanne Woodward in Now I Lay Me 
Down. 

Last fall, still fifteen pounds overweight 
from Now I Lay Me Down ("They paid a 
doctor, not me but a doctor, to make sure 
I lost that weight"), she joined the Yale 
Repertory Company to play the pathetical-
ly funny Red Cross girl in Joseph Heller's 
We Bombed inN ew Haven. 

At the cast party for We Bombed she 
stood amidst Yale faculty in her lucky 
purple chiffon dress, talking to Mr. and 
Mrs. Paul Newman and looking like 
nothing more than a faculty wife, with 
station wagons, Conn College and horse 
shows in her background. But the focus 
shifted when Estelle and Joanne Wood-
ward began dutifully kissing each other 
goodbye. 

Suddenly Paul Newman dropped to 
his haunches. And while his wife and 
Estelle dissolved in giggles, he sighted 
them through an imaginary camera. 
"Roll 'em," he shouted. "Make that kiss 
on the lips, girls, a little warmer, a little 
bigger, on the lips." 

Estelle says she lost money doing the 
Heller play. Those days she didn't com-
mute between her sprawling west side 
apartment and New Haven; she stayed 
over in an English professor's office in 
Branford College to save hotel bills. 
"There's no money in serious theater. I'm 
always broke." 

While she stayed in New Haven, a 
Columbia Teachers' College student 
stayed with her twelve-year-old twin 
daughters, Abbie and Martha Gehman. 
Estelle was married to Richard Gehman, a 
writer, in 1953 and divorced in 1958. 
"Like Myrtle," Estelle says, "every girl has 
a dre~m in her heart of settling down 
with a man to whom she is strongly at-
tracted. But if you can't do it, you can't 
do it." 

"I'm an actress and a mother. I'm a 
loner," she told me as we sat down at a 
luncheonette near the Barrymore a week 
before the Academy Awards ceremony. 
"I don't go out much, so I don't see many 
movies and shows. People say my work 
is original because I never see anybody 
else work." 

Estelle took off her coat, being careful 
not to crush an old-fashioned orchid 
corsage that Jose Quintero had given her. 
"When I'm in New York, I get up, make 
breakfast for the kids, pack school lunches 
and then go back to bed for an hour. Then 
I drag myself to work." 

"I'll have one of those big cookies over 
there," Estelle said with a cherubic smile. 
"I'm really not interesting enough to 
write about. All I do is work. Maybe you 
should announce my engagement to David 
Merrick. That's a good rumor. He's send-
ing me to the Academy Awards ceremony. 
Of course I had to promise to mention 
him if I won." 

She sighed, "Who needs an Academy 
Award anyway? Not me. I don't have the 
time or money to campaign for it. First 
you throw away $5,000 on a press agent, 
then once you win, you don't get work 
again for two years." 

Does she feel like a star? "Acting is my 
work. I can't help it if my name goes below 
or above a title. I just keep doing each 
part. There's nothing to strive for if you 
decide you're a star who has reached the 
heavens. 

"I don't like to admit it to myself, but 
I must be very ambitious, or else I never 
would have gone through all this with the 
kids and everything." 

She played with her fork. "Sometimes 
I think that nobody with brains goes into 
acting. I guess I'm an emotional, not a 
cerebral, actress. Emotional actors need 
psychiatry. You have to know yourself to 
throw yourself into roles. You can't be 
blocked. Sometimes I wish I was a writer 
working in privacy. It's tough to work 
always in a group with other emotional, 
egotistical people." 

What are her plans? "Well, I'm going to 
make another movie with Faye Dunaway, 
where I play the head of a modeling 
agency. I want to work with Arthur Penn 
again this summer in the Berkshire 
Theater. I guess it all depends on what hap-
pens to Myrtle, but the way things are 
looking, I'll probably be free." 

Estelle bad finished her big cookie and 
coffee and insisted on paying the biJI. A 
quarter fell off the table and rolled under 
the jukebox. Suddenly she was on her 
knees, then Oat on the floor, groping under 
the blaring jukebox. 
"How would this sound, Estelle?" I 
leaned over to ask. "Estelle Parsons, star 
of stage and screen, is now appearing 
under a jukebox, doing her famous find-
the-quarter act." 

"No, no," came her muffled shriek, 
"star of stage, screen and television. For 
God's sakes, don't forget television. I 
really make my living doing commercials 
like that Excedrin one that cures the 
flu-bug."
