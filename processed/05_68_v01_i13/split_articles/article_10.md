~'Tonight, Estelle, you are a 
star," said someone, "the 
bar-mitzvah girl." 
by Susan Braudy 
Three weeks ago, Estelle Parsons was 
bouncing down 47th Street to the Barry-
more Theater in New York wearing bright 
orange tights, an orange sweater and a 
short tweed skirt. She exuded the chunky 
sexuality of a junior league tennis player. 
Blanche Barrow, whose preacher's-
daughter plainness reminded you of dusty 
streets and dried-up lives, seemed far 
away. 

Estelle had just won an Oscar for her 
supporting role as Clyde's sister-in-law 
Blanche in Bonnie and Clyde. But in a 
week she'd still be out of a job. Tennessee 
Williams's new play, Seven Descents of 
Myrtle, with Estelle in her first starring 
Broadway role, was about to fold, panned 
by the critics. 

Four autograph hunters, on the look-
out for Blanche, passed Estelle by. She 
shook her head. "One woman waited for 
me by the stage door for two days but 
couldn't recognize me. Finally I went up 
to her. She was so happy. It was awful; her 
nose was running from the cold. Who 
needs a name on a scrap of paper?" 

Estelle is hard to type-cast. Yale people 
remember her as the pathetic nurse and 
doughnut-sir! in We Bombed in New 
Haven, who worried as much about mak-
ing lousy doughnuts as she d id about not 
getting a husband. 

Estelle can play women of any age, 
comic and tragic, plain and fancy, though 
always strongly emotional. And Estelle is 
an emotional woman. Her moods flash 
sultry humor, whining impatience and 
quick anger. But when she acts-and she 
hasn't taken a vacation in ten years-
these moods yield to a tight and deep 
control. 

Arthur Penn, director of Bonnie and 
Clyde, calls Estelle the epitome of the 
courageous actress who will try anything 
for a good characterization. "She offers a 
rich assortment of delectables, and all the 
director has to do is selt:ct those he likes 
best." 

Estelle's concentration and drive have 
paid off. Now at 40 and looking 30, she is 
finally making it big in a career less am-
bitious women give up at 25. In Seven 
Descents, Estelle fully realized one of 
Tennessee Williams's complex females, 
the sort that made stars of Jessica Tandy, 
Maureen Stapleton, Kim Hunter and 
Geraldine Page. As Myrtle, Estelle turned 
in a virtuoso performance as a newly-
married ex-carnival girl, down on her 
luck but not on her charm. In weather-
beaten pink boas, she combined the 
innocence of a puppy with the pizzazz of 
a carnie kewpie doll. 

Once again Estelle repeated her habit 
of getting rave reviews in folding plays. 
Before Seven Descents came back to New 
York after Philadelphia previews, critics 
were agreeing that Estelle had scored a 
personal triumph but the play would 
probably fold. 

In Philadelphia, right before the first 
paid preview, Estelle was sitting in her 
bare dressing room, staring over a table 
littered with makeup into a dusty mirror.

Her eyes were puffy, and her cheeks 
looked almost pouchy. 

"I had a nightmare about my character, 
Myrtle, last night. It was awful." She 
abruptly began teasing the front of her 
hair. "I had my hair dyed apricot for the 
play. I want the roots to show, but the 
audience won't be able to see them for a 
few weeks; that is; if we run that long. 
"Myrtle's roots show because she's a 
bad imitation of a Hollywood movie star. 
But when she figures out she's not going to 
make her show-biz dream, she latches onto 
this Southern gentleman to try out another 
dream, the happy-marriage dream." 

She began slapping white powder on her 
face and neck. "David Merrick was in 
here and kept staring at that movie maga-
zine." She pointed to a pink magazine with 
"Mia and Frank/ How Marriage 
Destroyed Their Love" on the cover. "I 
guess he was wondering if I go in for 
movie magazines, but I cho~ it as a prop 
for Myrtle." 

Estelle was now clipping a rhinestone 
cluster into the front of her hair. "Opening 
a play is awful. You keep asking, Why, 
what am I doing here? You have to be 
masochistic. This part is such a terrible 
responsibility. I'm hardly off-stage at all. 
You know something," she said in a voice 
low and almost without emphasis, "this 
is the worst moment of my life." 

Almost from the start of rehearsals 
Estelle could remember problems and 
disagreements. The press reported that 
David Merrick, the show's producer, had 
wanted cuts in the third act and a title 
change. Williams bad wanted to stick with 
the original title, Kingdom of Earth, and 
neither Williams nor director Jose 
Quintero wanted to make cuts until after 
a few Philadelphia performances. 

Harry Guardino, Brian Bedford and 
Estelle came to rehearsal in the Hotel 
· Claridge ballroom in New York one day 
to bear Quintero announce that he was 
leaving the show. He then left the ballroom 
followed by Tennessee Williams. 

''That day was the most wearing of all. 
When I got home that night I was more 
exhausted than I bad ever been after any 
rehearsal." 

The next day Quintero was back. Ap-
parently a compromise had been made. 
The title was changed, but cuts were put off 
until after the Philadelphia try-outs, which 
were delayed a week. 

Estelle turned back to the mirror. 
"Here's a telegram from my parents wish-
ing me luck. They never wanted me in the 
theater, and they were probably right." 

The telegram leaned against the mirror 
behind Twiggy eyelashes and a jar of 
Hollywood cold cream. "But you better 
go now," she said. "I have to change." 

She began putting shiny orange lipstick on 
her mouth, deliberately smearing it well 
beyond her lip line. 

Ten minutes later Estelle, now Myrtle, 
bounced onto the stage, carrying battered 
luggage and her pink movie magazine. 
"Woo, woo, that wind is penetratin'," she 
howled happily, "shahrp as a butchah's 
knife." 

Twelve butchah's knives, two weeks and 
180 miles later, Estelle took her opening-
night curtain calls and returned to her 
dressing room in the Barrymore theater on 
Broadway. The mirror-lined dressing 
room smelled like a greenhouse. Orange-
pink camellias from Mobile filled both 
sinks. "They won't keep, no stoppers in 
the sink," she said, nervously turning on 
the spigots again and again. 

Queuing at the door were a host of well-
wishers including Joanne Woodward, who 
wore a blue McCarthy button on a gold 
dress. Photographers began snapping 
pictures of the two women, who played to-
gether in the film Now I Lay Me Down, 
Paul Newman's directorial debut, which 
will open in September. 

When everybody left, Estelle pulled off 
her eyelashes and sat down. "I'm glad it's 
over. Imagine playing five more times this 
week. But on to the Sardi's ordeal." Her 
voice cracked with fatigue, but she was 
grinning her wide grin. "I guess tonight's 
the night you always dream· of as an 
actress." 

At Sardi's Estelle sat with a group of old 
friends, most of them not in theater, who 
spoke little about the play. They assumed 
that the Philadelphia raves for her per-
formance would continue ·in New York. 
"Tonight, Estelle, you are a star," said one, 
"the Bar Mitzvah girl." And theater talk 
quickly yielded to McCarthy versus 
Kennedy. 

But Estelle wasn't in the discussion. Her 
mind seemed to be still on the play. The 
argument barely stopped to note that an 
eleven-o'clock reviewer had praised 
Estelle's acting but bad knocked the play. 
David Merrick's office had promised a 
cast party upstairs at Sardi's. But when 
everyone had finished their canneloni and 
fruit cup, they discovered Williams and 
Merrick had slipped away and so bad the 
party; and so, it was beginning to seem, 
had hopes for the play's long run. 

Estelle's family goes back to the May-
flower. Her grandfather, Starr Parsons, 
taught Latin at Harvard; her father, Eben, 
is a Massachusetts lawyer. She is also 
descended from Effie Bickford, a soubrette 
of the 1880's who is considered the 
family's black sheep. 

Estelle made her stage debut at four as 
Little Bo Peep shrieking and shrieking 
for her lost sheep on a revolving birthday 
cake. "And I've had shrieking parts ever 
since." Warner Brothers enhanced her 
shrieks in Bonnie and Clyde by instructing 
exhibitors to turn the soundtrack way up. 
Mter boarding school ("a Quaker 
school for gracious living") Estelle grad-
uated from Connecticut College in 1949 
and then went to Boston University Law 
School for a year. 

"I was always more interested in show 
biz than io a law career. I was always 
trying to quit college and take agents up oo 
offers to go to New York and sing with 
bands. But my parents said it wasn't the 
life for me." 

Finally Estelle escaped. In 1950 she 
turned down the chance to transfer to 
Harvard Law School and landed a job as 
weather-girl on Dave Garroway's Today 
Show. 

In 1955 Estelle, by then producer-com-
mentator, left her $800-a-week job with 
Garroway to study acting. "In ten years," 
she declared then, "I intend to be one of 
the world's best actresses." 

In the following years she played fea-
tured roles in Broadway musicals like 
Happy Hunting, starring Ethel Merman •. 
in 1957. She studied at Actors Studio with 
Lee Strasberg, then played the lead in 
Mrs. Dally Has a Lover, winning a 
Theater World Award; she picked up two 
"Obies," played the prostitutes in Edward 
Albee's Malcolm in 1965 and played 
Galileo's daughter in the Lincoln Center 
Galileo in 1967.
