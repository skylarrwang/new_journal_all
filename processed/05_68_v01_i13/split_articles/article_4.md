icature," he went on, "to make cute and 
likeable the very thing that you are 
attacking. Therefore, the implications of 
its being an attack only come across to 
those who already see it as one before 
you make the drawing." 

His main problem as an artist, he said, 
is "just getting to do the things I want to 
do." Every caricature, he believes, is 
simultaneously a public and a private 
statement: public in that it has to do with 
problems of verisimilitude and private in 
that it conveys a personal attitude. His 
painting, however, does not contain this 
duality, and this is his dilemma. "I cannot 
make a bridge, as Lautrec did, between 
caricature and painting. I can't seem to 
bring them into the same world. I think I 
would be even more able to communicate 
all sorts of things if I could ever bring 
them together." 

Our morning had all but vanished. Levine 
had talked a lot, and he sounded slightly 
hoarse. As we stood up and stretched, he 
mentioned the New York art world he is 
far from in the sunny reaches of Brooklyn. 
He has nothing but contempt for the 
universe of flashy Manhattan galleries. 
"Today," he said, his voice rising slightly, 
"anyone can accomplish anything in a . 
standardless art world, which has been re-
duced to that by the marketing ideal-
never mind what the art is; is it saleable?" 

H is anti-establishment views run deep. He 
is irritated by the hypocritically obliging 
response of critics to the.spasmodic 
changes in popular taste. "I think that the 
trade in art," said Levine, "has absolutely 
fulfilled the critique which Marx made on 
the role of the bourgeoisie in art; he said 
something about when you can reduce 
everything to money you will have made 
equal a Rembrandt and so many pounds of 
horse manure." 

We took a few turns around the studio, 
Levine quietly commenting on the small 
paintings on the walls. Each made a direct, 
concise statement, often so well that you 
felt as if you had been poked lightly in the 
stomach. You felt that each was helping 
you to know more clearly something you 
were already dimly aware of. All the same, 
there was nothing you could say. 

We went down to the third floor and 
entered his study again. Levine walked to 
his desk and looked at the makings of his 
caricature of Bobby Kennedy. "It's for 
The Washington Post," he said. ''The 
problem is, how do I do him?" Levine had 
been rendering the senator as a ground-
hog; one paw was raised, testing the air. 
"Weasels steal eggs," Levine mused, "so 
maybe I'll make him into a weasel." This 
was a few days after Kennedy had declared 
himself a presidential candidate. 

The only time the relaxation left 
Levine's voice that morning was when he 
looked now at the photos of his subject 
which littered the desk. He stared at them, 
seeming to see them for the first time, 
and momentarily he was outraged. "An 
incredible opportunist!" he said curtly. 
"He has no ideals and no morals. He's 
doing the same things now he's always 
done." Asked about Nixon, he laughed 
and said with mock fatigue, "Words 
fail me." 

His wife and two children were out, 
so he was going to meet a friend for lunch. 
We went to the ball and put on our coats. 
A high, rambunctious wind kicked at 
us as we stepped outside. The sunlight was 
still full, but the air had gotten colder. 
Levine had neglected to put on an over-
coat, and his well-cut tweed jacket winged 
on either side of him as he hunched into 
the gale. Nevertheless, he walked part 
way to the subway station, talking of 
Eakins and the artistry of the Grand Arrny 
Plaza's arch of triumph. 

Finally we shook hands. He clapped me 
on the shoulder, dismissed my thanks, 
turned and moved away. The wind seemed 
Â·to follow him back up the street, and be 
walked stiffly, buffeted, a man whose 
fondest ambition it is "to be unseeded and 
yet win at Wimbledon."
