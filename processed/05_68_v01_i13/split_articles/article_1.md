Humphrey
Winter, 1968, was the season of feverish 
political activity at Yale and other 
colleges. Students traveled to New Hamp-
shire and points west for McCarthy and 
clustered around televisions to see Bobby 
jump in, to watch Rocky bow out 
(temporarily) and to hear Chet, Dave and 
Walter tell it like it was. 

By Saturday, April27, the season was 
over. On that day the announcement that 
Hubert Humphrey, Vice-President of the 
United States, wished to be promoted was 
easily upstaged here by the Cross Campus 
Controversy and the Rites of Spring. 

Perhaps the indifference stemmed from 
Hubert's being a little out of step with 
recent events. With thousands of college 
students anxious and angry about a brutal 
war far away, three weeks after the death 
Martin Luther King and the ensuing 
violence, the Vice-President proclaimed 
that "1968 should be ... a time of great 
confidence and above all ... a time for 
public happiness in this nation." 

Or perhaps Humphrey's rhetoric is too 
uncomfortably familiar. Indeed, he looks 
and sounds very much like his most 
notable mixed blessing, his patron and 
albatross, Lyndon Johnson. 

The cosmic agenda-"these priorities 
of freedom, country and party have 
guided me ... " is Johnson's: "Throughout 
my entire public career I have followed 
the personal philosophy that I am a free 
man, an American, a public servant and 
a member of my party, in that order .... " 

The exuberant tone-"the politics of 
happiness, the politics of purpose, the 
politics of joy"-recalls 1964: ''We're for 
a lot of things and agin' mighty few"-as 
if the bloody four years since had never 
happened. 

Even the central purpose of the Vice-
President's campaign, "the unity of our 
people," is strangely reminiscent. Demo-
crats are asked to support him because he 
alone can hold together, for one more lap, 
the traditional elements of the Democratic 
coalition. Under his banner northern 
blacks and southern whites, "intellectu-
als," labor unions and maybe even a few 
businessmen can congregate; and that is 
"the way politics ought to be in America." 

A group of Yale students who do sup-
port him have organized themselves into 
"Yale for HHH." Admitting that his 
candidacy is "not fashionable" and that 
since he has not formally entered any 
primaries, there isn't much students can 
do for him, the group plans to provide 
information about the Vice-President and 
prepare for a possible fall contest between 
him and either Richard Nixon or Ronald 
Reagan, either one a match which they 
feel would prompt wide support for 
Humphrey at Yale. 

As an initial project, the group dis-
tributed leaflets chiefly devoted to describ-
ing Humphrey's legislative record prior to 
1961. The leaflet asserts that "this country 
needs a series of major reforms and re-
allocations almost immediately." While 
he has made no proposals recently about 
how to achieve those goals, a spokesman 
for the group is confident that Hubert 
Humphrey will step forward with relevant 
ideas before long: "He always has in 
the past~"
