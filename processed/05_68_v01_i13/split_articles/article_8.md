The Unaccountable Mr. Ho: What now? 
by Paul Mus 
Yale University recently had the benefit of a documented and provocative lecture by the eminent British expert on Southeast 
Asian policy, Mr. Dennis J. Duncanson. 

Mr. Duncanson, the author of Government and Revolution in Vietnam, is highly qualified to approach first hand what he de-
fined as the "three enigmas" still confronting us in Vietnam, especially in the masterful and elusive personality of the President of 
the Democratic Republic, Ho Chi Minh. 

Mr. Duncanson is quite familiar with the problems of British Malaya, the one and only communist "unrest" that has been 
handled efficiently. He spent five years with the British mission headed by Sir Robert Thompson in Saigon. 

He had contact with President Diem, of 
whom he says, "As many of his com-
patriots might admit today, if in the East 
one dared to speak one's mind about faJien 
politicians, he was the embodiment of his 
country's soul, for good no Jess than for 
bad." 

Of the three "enigmas" in Vietnam, two 
are classical items in the field-the rela-
tionship between the DRV (North Viet-
nam) and Southern guerrillas, and the 
DRY's dependence upon Peking. In 
both cases, interpretative speculation 
has proved so deceptive that even a close 
perusal of the facts available does not ap-
pear, after so many years, to leave us 
much the wiser. The major difficulty, as 
Mr. Duncanson sees it, is that the answer 
to both questions hinges on the one to be 
given to what he considers the third and 
major riddle: Is President Ho's charismatic 
personality relying on a deep nationalistic 
urge and commitment of the Vietnamese 
people? 

As a matter of fact, such a trend has 
generally been considered the dominant 
Jesson of Vietnam's whole history, 
dramatically illustrated and confirmed by 
present events. In his book, however, 
Mr. Duncanson deliberately rejects such 
views. 

The emancipation of the first Viet-
namese states from Chinese rule in the 
tenth century is usually explained in 
modem history as a nationalist up-
rising against an early type of colonial 
rule; but a closer look at the events 
attending the collapse of the Tang 
dynasty does not bear out this explana-
tion, nor is it compatible with the sub-
sequent course of Sino-Vietnamese 
relations. It was the Thais of Nam 
Chao who evicted the Chinese from 
effective control of Tonkin in 863, not 
any popular uprising of the Vietnamese 
.... Vietnam became independent be-
cause China, in a state of anarchy, 
abandoned it. 

Mr. Duncanson's iconoclastic historical 
dispositions do not prepare him to accept 
another commonplace assertion, that the 
Vietnamese people have very com-
mendably resisted, in spite of immediate 
contact and even after a thousand-year-
long annexation, the weird assimilative 
power of their immense and justly prestigi-
ous neighbor. For China combined in her 
own inimitable "cosmic" culture much of 
what was the essence of Greek, Roman 
and to some degree Western medieval 
civilization--enough at least to convert 
and lead a continent. The Chinese world 
was a continent, as its counterpart, the 
Indian world. 

It is a fact that the Vietnamese have 
stopped Chinese culture along a line 
reaching from Moncay to Lao Kay, com-
pelling it to build there not China but 
Vietnam. 

They have found a way to absorb 
Chinese culture instead of being asborbed 
by it. The key to this unparalleled achieve-
ment was apparently that they never re-
sorted to the usual weapon of the weak, 
ethnic hatred against the their conqueror. 
However, Government and Revolution 
in Vietnam would tell us quite another 
story: 

The evidence is against the modem 
Vietnamese complaint that China 
would at aU times have liked to swal-
low up Tonkin and was only prevented 
by the patristic ardour and the valour 
of the people. Without exception, 
Chinese interventions after Vietnam 
became independent had as their ob-
ject the restoration of Vietnamese 
princes deposed by their subjects, and 
the issue of legitimacy can be traced 
as a Chinese concern right through to 
the modem period. Even the action 
of the Yung Lo Emperor in 1407 was 
clearly intended to take a disorderly 
vassal state in hand when its ruler 
appealed for help and to put it firmly 
in order once for all. 

Our academic circles, with their tradi-
tions and possible prejudices, will admire 
the extensive and deep erudition displayed 
along these dense, certainly controversial 
but stimulating pages. 

The embarrassment begins when 
against a background of generally per-
ceptive historical appraisals, the reader 
is faced with the trite statement, end-
lessly repeated in this country from the 
highest government circles to the lowest 
level of our press, that the communist 
enterprise in Vietnam, "far from having 
been founded spontaneously by local 
men converted to Marxism through 
intellectual curiosity and conviction, was 
from the outset a subversive movement 
introduced into Vietnam by the Com-
munist International, out of considerations 
that hold no interest for the Vietnamese 
people." Did this clicM have to be repro-
duced here, without mention or attempted 
refutation of most obvious local facts and 
factors allegeable against it? From the 
same viewpoint it is disquieting that as 
crucial a development in Vietnamese 
history as the foundation and confirmation 
of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 
should be inscribed under the chapter 
heading "The Anarchy of Ho Chi Minh." 

Remarkably accurate and discerning in 
the collection and computation of details 
and at the same time apt to the broadest 
historical envisioning, Mr. Duncanson 
seems to suffer from a periodic color-
blindness: whenever the picture turns red, 
the lines, to his otherwise clear-sighted 
eye, become confused. 

Against the consensus of Vietnamese 
and Western historians that the Viet-
namese have had to vindicate themselves 
as a nation against steady Chinese attempts 
to englobe them, it is a rather poor case, 
though cleverly pleaded, to postulate that 
(l) far from trying to rip back the self-
rule the Vietnamese had achieved under 
somewhat distant and general Chinese 
suzerainty, the Chinese never took arms 
against their vassal and once protectorate, 
and (2) the Chinese instead tried to restore 
"Vietnamese princes deposed by their sub-
jects," a policy which, to all Western 
standards, would amount to a recognition 
of the country's independent status, as 
established in 972. 

Modem events help us to understand 
the policy that integrates a territory, as far 
as materially possible, in a broader system. 
First a monopoly of "protection against 
hostile neighbors" is extended through the 
use of a "Chief of State by appointment." 
A model of this may be seen in the 
"Emperor" Bao Dai during the first Indo-
chinese war. Such a policy does not go 
far, it must be noted, when it meets with 
antagonism or fretfulness in the country. 
From the first Chinese conquest of 111 
B.C. to the "liberation" of 939, who would 
seriously contest that sporadic insurrec-
tions, latent unrest and in several instances 
prolonged and effective guerrila warfare 
have manifested themselves in Chiao 
Chih (the ancient Chinese name for 
Tonkin) every time the political and 
military domination of the Chinese was 
impaired by troubles at home or divisions 
of the Empire? And this has had an un-
mistakable, though specifically Asian, 
"national" accent. Shall we then follow 
Mr. Duncanson in reading the long and 
consistent sequence of events as just a 
token of the local population's restless-
ness and endemic anarchy? Is it only on 
this that Ho ("the unaccountable Mr. 
Ho," as a British colleague in the middle 
forties in Calcutta described him) has 
built his "charismatic" personality? If 
such were the case, how long could one 
expect that the present suspension of "all 
internal conflict" in the DRV may endure? 

But Jet us not miss so completely the ex-
plicit and bloody lessons of history, past 
and present! The anarchy of Ho Chi 
Minh? Against this very human and un-
derstandable temptation to fall back, for 
lack of better comfort, on that kind of 
complacent thinking, the best antidote 
will be found in Pike's encyclopedic (and 
truly fundamental, on all points of fact) 
Vietcong, the Organization and Tech-
niques of the National Liberation Front 
of South Vietnam (though the present 
writer would not endorse all the political 
suggestions of this straightforward and 
highly informative book). 

Pike gives an impartial demonstration 
of the fact that this undoubtedly "Com-
munist-led" organization owes its suc-
cesses and its ascendency in South Viet-
nam to its high level of efficiency and 
administrative competence. This tipped 
the balance against the Saigon government 
and its kaleidoscopic display of military 
hats. 

The last and deplorable episodes of the 
once-lively intercourse between the 
French and Vietnamese, from Dien Bien 
Phu to Geneva, show how far on the road 
of deception and destruction a people who 
styled itself without wincing "the most in-
telligent on earth," has been dragged by 
its unintelligence of the local situation. 

No doubt, in the case of Mr. Duncanson, 
the word that will come to the reader's 
mind will be, quite to the contrary, "intel-
ligence," and intelligence harnessed to 
political intents. Yet it is to be feared that, 
half way between government and 
revolution, "intelligence," receiving, as 
is natural, its passwords from the former, 
may take from the latter, or from its costly 
aftermath, precisely too professional an 
evaluation, as dependent on manipulations 
rather than on a definite and straight-
forward policy. The American public, to 
whom the last word should fall by right 
(and who seem to be increasingly awaken-
ing to this constitutional fact), when con-
fronted by a book of that quality and 
at the same time learning the mark of such 
an inspiration, should reap the full benefit 
of a patient and direct digest, while re-
maining aware of the preconceived ideas 
along which the computation has been 
organized in somewhat dismaying coin-
cidence with the most unproductive lines 
followed by the present Administration's 
policy. 

Bearing these remarks in mind, a reader 
feeling the need to reassess President 
Ho Chi Minh's personality in terms of his 
full historical stature, past and present, 
will find valuable Jean Lacouture's Ho 
Chi Minh, a Political Biography, in its 
forthcoming English translation (Random 
House). Ho is presented neither as an 
infatuated doctrinarian nor as an im-
penitent anarchist. He is even less a 
prospective or even possible Tito (in the 
highly mythical sense usually attached to 
that name). Instead Ho is an authentic 
Marxist, aware of the necessity of local 
accommodation and, precisely in this, a 
genuine patriot. 

All this establishes Ho on both accounts 
as a valid interlocutor for this great nation. 
That is, however, if America gets beyond 
a hopefully superannuated short-sighted-
ness and does not give up its own ideals 
and traditions of fair play as the hour of 
destiny draws close. The time has come 
to give up instead the inspiration behind a 
statement made by no less respectable an 
authority than Dean Acheson. No matter 
what Parliament may think of it, Acheson 
said not so long ago, the point is to get 
what you want. This is not the sort of 
guidance the world has been accustomed 
to receiving .from the US since the days 
of Benjamin Franklin's famous mission 
to a Paris pregnant with its own revolu-
tion. 

Sixteen years ago in the concluding 
pages of a sociological evaluation of the 
first Vietnamese war (the Franco-Viet-
namese War), the present writer suggested 
that the Marxist-Leninist thesis that would
