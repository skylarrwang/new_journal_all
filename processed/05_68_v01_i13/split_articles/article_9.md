An outsider at someone 
else's feast 
by Betty Jean Lifton 
After the signing of the Geneva Agree-
ment in 1954, only a few American 
correspondents remained in Hanoi to 
witness the Vietminh takeover. We were 
staying at our own risk, according to our 
consulate. B'ut we stayed because we knew 
that in watching the French officially 
evacuate the pleasure-loving city that had 
been their colonial base fot seventy ye~s 
to the communist guerrilla forces of 
Ho Chi Minh, we were viewing an historic 
event. How historic it was and how our 
own country's destiny would be tragically 
tied up with North Vietnam a decade later, 
we could not then understand. 

It keeps coming back, that cold, rain-
drenched day of the takeover: October 9, 
1954. The ironic picture of the modern 
French mechanized army rumbling out, 
sector by sector, and being replaced by 
short young Vietminh troops in faded 
green fatigues and rubber-soled canvas 
shoes. The Vietminh,like an ominous 
shadow, trail just a few hundred yards 
behind the French, keeping a respectful 
distance until that final moment when they 
envelop everything. 

They were emerging from the jungles 
and the mountains for the first time since 
the fighting broke out in Hanoi, December 
19, 1946. They allowed us to inspect them 
as if they were no more than camping 
equipment on display, each man a pack-
aged unit of tin cup, mosquito netting, rice 
ration, aluminum fork and spoon, 
wooden-stick grenades, short bayonet, 
entrenching tools and rice bowl. 

The citizens of Hanoi, under a French-
imposed daytime curfew, remained behind 
their shuttered windows. For the past few 
days they had been busy whitewashing 
walls with signs like: "Go South For 
lndepedence," taking down pictures of 
ex-Emperor Bao Dai and shopping in the 
market place for red and gold material to 
make the Vietminh flag. 

The stores once filled with French per-
fume and lingerie, the bars and cabarets, 
the restaurants with their bouillabaisse 
and coq au vin were boarded up: their 
owners had already fled south. All that 
had been French seemed about to pass 
with these long convoys of white men, not 
a few of whom must have loved this city as 
their own, 

At five in the afternoon the last French 
jeep rolled over the Doumer Bridge on its 
way to Haiphong, the port city that did not 
have to be evacuated until May. In 1897 
the French had built this steel bridge over 
the Red River to connect Hanoi with the 
adjacent rice delta. The Vietnamese had 
protested then that such a construction 
would anger the Red River dragon. But 
the French had laughed and gone on with 
their work in the turbulent rapids. Their 
success increased French prestige and 
lessened the dragon's. Now with this last 
jeep it seemed that the dragon was having 
its revenge. 

Auhe Vietminb took this fia.al sector,

Journal. 

the people poured enthusiastically out 
into the streets to welcome them, throwing 
flowers, waving the Vietminh flag with its 
gold star rising on a red background. But 
the troops did not relax. Although there 
were many local boys among them, they 
kept their discipline and ranks, and did not 
mix with the crowds. 

Later I was to hear fro.m a Vietname$e 
college student about his cousin, w~o had 
marched into Hanoi that day. The cousin 
was only 16 years old wben he left Hanoi 
to join the resistance. His parents had not 
known until the French withdrawal 
whether he was alive or dead. Overcome 
with happiness, they had planned a family 
reunion in his honor. 

"No," be objected firmly. "It is not 
patriotic for you to have a party. You must 
not spend money on celebrations until we 
have liberated all of Vietnam. For eight 
years I have lived on nothing but rice and 
salt-rice and salt twjce a day-and this 
is all I will eat until Vietnam is united." 

His parents were burt and confused; 
they considered themselves patriots. Had 
they not given this son to the Vietminh? 
But they were also Vietnamese, and tradi-
tions of family loyalty and filial piety go 
deep in Indochina. This valiant soldier for 
whom they had waited with such longing 
had finally returned-but he was no longer 
theirs. He spouted words of ideology they 
could not understand. He preferred sleep-
ing in the barracks to spending even one 
night in his own bed. 

"And yet my cousin is more nationalist 
than communist," the college student had 
said. "He was only fighting to free Vietnam 
from French colonialism. We hate the 
French." The student paused as if con-
sidering for a moment and added: "And 
if you won't be insulted, we bate America, 
. too, for helping them. Americans are even 
more foreign to us than the French. If you 
had ever lived under foreign occupation, 
you would know what it is to hate." 

That first night all of Hanoi was gar-
landed in flowers and flags. Ho Chi Minh 
and his top officials had not yet entered 
the city. The advance guard was to prepare 
the people for life under the new regime, 
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As 
if they had been rehearsing this moment 
for years in the jungles, they swung into 
immediate action. They organized Hanoi 
into neighborhood groups and urged 
everyone to attend the first of the many 
meetings that characterize a new com-
munist state. 

The foreign press spent part of the even-
ing at the Metropole Hotel as guests of the 
Indian, Canadian and Polish members of 
the International Control Commission. 
But while the champagne was bubbling in 
our glasses, we were thinking about those 
meetings from which we, unlike the 
Russian, Chinese and other communist 
correspondents, were barred. 

"The sessions are so dull," a young 
Vietnamese woman I shall call Trac was 
to confide in me the folfowing week. "The 
canbo (as the cadres are called) keep re-
peating things about French colonialism 
and American warmongering until you 
almost fall asleep. Sometimes they go on 
until after midnight. Only the children 
seem to like them because they get to 
dance and stay up late.'' 

Trac was from a wealthy family. Her 
hair was carefully waved and her lovely 
silk gown, with its high Chinese collar 
and long slit skirt falling over satin 
trousers, was made of imported French 
material. Most of her relatives and friends 
had left the North. "My uncles were ex-
pecting large shipments from France and 
had to go south to wait for them. Other-
wise they would lose a great deal of mon"ey. 
But some went because they had heard 
the Vietminh kill the rich and are good 
only to the working classes. They were 
afraid." 

Trac had stayed on because her father 
was ill and did not want to leave the city 
of his ancestors. One brother had gone 
south; another was with the Vietininh. 
''The Vietminh will probably be good to 
us until the elections," she sal d. "After 
that . . . well, I don't know." 

With the departure of the French army, 
we had to leave our fon:mer press billets 
and find other accommodations. The one 
large hotel, the Metropole; was occupied 
by the Control Commission. A few of us 
were lucky enough to get rooms m a 
former brothel across the street~ the Coq 
D'or; the only remaining tenants after 
the girls had fted were the rats and cock-
roaches. My room was bare except for a 
bed in the center and the mosquito netting 
which hung down from a bamboo rod on 
the ceiling, but it had the virtue of over-
looking the Metropole, which was to be-
come an important source of information. 

The morning after the takeover 1 could 
hear voices through the shutters of my 
window. Looking out I saw more Vietminh 
soldiers, thousands of them, still streaming 
in from the outlying villages, singing their 
victory songs. For a moment I felt alien 
in this jubilant city, an outsider at someone 
else's feast. 

I walked the streets of Hanoi that first 
day with Kien, a Vietnamese boy who was 
serving as interpreter for the Control 
Commission. The French garrison town of 
yesterday seemed to have .disappeared. 
Hanoi had a festival atmosphere. Victory 
arches rose from the intersections, and 
huge banners proclaimed ''Ten Thousand 
Years for Ho Chi Minh" and "Unbreak-
able Is the Friendship Between China and 
Hanoi." The tree-lined boulevards (which 
the French so fondly laid out in their 
colonial towns as if to create a little piece 
of home) were now being cleared for the 
afternoon victory parade. 

The park in the center of town was filled 
with young promenaders, girls with their 
hair hanging long and sleek down their 
backs, boys sporting Vietminh buttons and 
scarves. They cheered wildly as their in-
fantrymen passed by, each soldier carrying 
flowers in one hand, a rifle in the other. 
Mothers held their babies up to see-

We bought some newspapers after the 
parade and sat in the warm sun at one of 
the little tables along the lake. People 
passing by whispered, "Look, there's a 
Russian woman.'' 

My interpreter had learned his English 
working for the British Information 
Office while his older brother was fighting 
in the Vietminh army. He told me that the 
people of Vietnam are nationalist in 
their feelings, care little about com-
munism and are wary of China. 'We have 
always hated the Chinese," he said. "It 
was from this very lake that our great 
warrior Le Loi drew the sword with which 
he defeated China almost 600 years ago. 
Before that we fought China for over a 
thousand years." 

Yet Kien spoke in a mixture of Western 
and communist idiom. "Did you notke 
how kind the police are today?" he asked. 
"They have all been brainwashed by the 
canbo in a three-month coarse in the

villages." He explained that the word for 
bramwashing in Vietnamese is "chinb-
huan" (pronounced "ching-wan"). 
"Chinh" means correct, "huan" means 
to pull in a good way. "Brainwashing must 
be a good thing if police go in corrupt 
and come out honest," said K.ien. 

His face darkened as he read me the 
Chinese and Soviet press releases in the 
newspaper. Russia's five~year plan was 
described, reforms in China were praised. 
The editorial columns informed the people 
that everyone must be prepared to endure 
hardships for the next few years until after 
the elections in 1956. There would be 
longer working hours, possibly a rice 
shortage, many sacrifices until after the 
elections. The period after the elections 
(which were never to be) loomed like a 
utopia when the 13 million people of the 
North would be united in blissful harmony 
witli the 11 million people of the South. 

"Does it really matter if there are elec-
tions?" Kien bitterly interjected. "Under 
either side the Vietnamese people wiJI not 
know independence. H the North wins, we 
will be domin&.ted by Chinese and Russian 
infiuence. If the South wins, we'll still have 
the French with American io.ftuence." He 
added with an ironic smile: "Do you 
understand that this is the tragedy of my 
people? No matter what happens, we will 
not have independence." 

There was one young person who was 
clearly not confused in those early days in 
Hanoi. That was the young female canbo 
assigned to the Control Commission's 
transportation division in front of the 
Metropole Hotel DeeMed in a shapeless 
ru:my tunic just like the men's, she wore her 
hair pulled back severely into two braids; 
her broad face was well scrubbed and de-
void of make-up. 'Women in every respect 
are now equal to men," the new constitu-
tion read, and "Pigtails," as we called her 
among ourselves, seemed to illustrate this 
with the brisk efficiency with which she 
translated instructions from English and 
French for the Vietnamese drivers. 

However, Pigtails obviously had other 
tasks, too. One afternoon she stopped Trac 
on the street with the cryptic remark: "I 
understand an American lady has been to 
your home." Trac bad never seen Pigtails 
before and was shaken by this encounter. 
"It isn't that you know they are following 
you," she complained to me. "It's just that 
they always seem to know what you are 
doing." After that, Trac was always "too 
busy" to see me. 

To my surprise, Pigtails agreed to an 
interview at the hotel. She arrived accom-
panied by a male canbo in a battle helmet, 
who was armed with a pad and pencil. 
Since he was not introduced, I also pre-
tended he was not there; but he wrote 
copious notes, and I had the feeling he was 
getting the better story. 

Pigtails told me bow she had joined the 
Vietminh in 1945 when it was a coalition 
party headed by the nationalist and com-
munist hero, Ho Chi Minh. She fled Hanoi 
with the troops when negotiations with the 
French over independence broke down the 
following year. 

It was a bard life in the villages at first, 
but she helped organize literacy courses 
for the peasants and studied medicine in a 
small hospital unit. To become a canbo 
she trained intermittently in three-month 
courses in Marxist history and revolution-
ary techniques and then helped set up such 
resistance activities as Foster Mothers 
for the Wounded, Cultural Corps enter-
tainers for the troops, factory workers and 
supply runners. She married another 
canbo during this time but saw him only 
twice a year because he was working with 
the racial minorities in the mountains. 
They-had two small children whom she 
left in a village to be cared for. 

"When Vietnam is free and united there 
will be time again for family life," she said. 
"Now we women must give our entire 
energies to the resistance." 

What had given Pigtails her early 
political fervor? She remembered her 
father, a government clerk in Saigon, 
continually dreaming of Vietnam as an 
independent country again and brooding 
over the heavy taxes inflicted on the 
peasants, the lack of educational pro-
grams, the constant draining of his coun-
try's resources into the coffers of a foreign 
power. Even after his early death, when 
her mother had taken her to Jive with 
relatives in Hanoi, she never forgot her 
father's vision. At the close of World 
War ll, she felt be would have wanted 
her to give her services to the government 
that Ho Chi Minh bad just set up in Hanoi 
--one that stressed national unity and 
co-operation with the West. 

"When the Western powers did not 
honor the Atlantic Charter and allowed 
the French to continue colonizing us, my 
friends and I moved closer to the com-
munist wing of the Vietminh. We became 
convinced that the communist program 
offered the last hope for strong and unified 
action against the French." 

Pigtails asked me if American women 
had fought in Korea. She was curious to 
know if they had the same revolutionary 
zeal as she to fight and die for their coun-
try. "I am sure American women are very 
nice,'' she said, "but it is too bad your 
country does not understand the Viet-
namese people. You are sending money 
to South Vietnam to build up an army, 
but they will never know independence 
with the corrupt government. The way 
your country acts, we think you want war." 

Like on welcome guests who are neither 
encouraged nor completely rebUlfed-
requests for interviews with Ho Chi Minh 
and other government leaders were merely 
ignored-we roamed the streets of Hanoi 
for our material. Sometimes I would stop 
in at the walled compound of Jean 
Sainteny, that controversial Frenchman 
whose car bad entered Hanoi over the 
Doumer Bridge at the same time his 
countrymen were pulling out. 

Sainteny had been sent by Mendes-
France on an unofficial economic mission 
to explore the possibility of coexistence 
with this new regime, a quest that was 
looked on with deep suspicion by the 
French, Americans and Vietnamese in ttle 
South. "Americans misunderstand my 
purpose," Sainteny told me. "Our mission 
is not communist. In fact, the Vietminb 
think we're right-wing capitalists. We be-
lieve that if there is a chance of keeping 
North Vietnam within the Western bloc 
through trade agreements, we want to 
try it." 

But the drama of Sainteny's story lay 
more in the past than in the present. At the 
end of World War II be was the Hiih 
Commissioner of North Vietnam. Al-
though strongly hostile to America's ideals 
of liberating tbe colonies then, he was 
wise enough to J'ealize that France could 
retain her control only if she gave Vietnam 
independence within the French Union. 
At the time, Ho Cbi Minh was willing to 
make this compromise, and an agreement 
to this effect was actually signed by the 
two men. However, when the French 
colons tried to undermine it by setting up 
a separate state in the South, the Vietminh 
felt betrayed; and after a few skirmishes 
they rose up in Hanoi that fateful Decem-
ber 19. Sainteny was wounded and almost 
lost his life. 

Now once again the fates had thrown 
Sainteny and Ho Chi Minh together, but 
their roles were reversed. The French 
colonial whom Ho bad bad to beg for in~ 
dependence nQW could only hope to make 
the North a kind of Yugoslavia. And Ho 
was in a position to dictate the terms of 
any arrangement he might care to make 
with France. 

Sainteny did not have to wait long for 
an audience with Ho. "It was as if I had 
seen him only eight days ago instead of 
eight years," Sainteny told me after their 
first meeting. "He was very natural and 
direct. We did not talk about the war at all. 
I was amazed at his lack of hostility." 

Sainteny did succeed in arranging a 
trade agreement, but his mission was to 
fail within a few years. Too much that was 
irrevocable had already passed between 
the two sides. 

The night the clocks were changed to 
Peking time I was having dinner at the 
Sainteny compound. We did not take 
the change seriously, and it was a few 
minutes past the 11 p.m. curfew when 
one of the members of the mission drove 
me back to the Coq D'or. We were given 
an impressive demonstration of the thor-
oughness of the Vietminh security system. 
Every few streets sentries stepped out from 
the shadows and then, seeing we were 
foreign, motioned us on. But when we 
came to the section of town where the old 
prison was located, four guards jumped 
out and rushed the car with bayonets. We 
skidded to a stop immediately. 

We frantically shoved identification 
cards through the window, but they 
weren't interested. They knew that 
foreigners were no more authorized than 
Vietnamese to be out after curfew. One 
of them yanked the car door open roughly 
and, pointing with his bayonet, signaled 
my companion to get out and go with him. 
The Frenchman had just been tellin& 
Me how he had been a paratrooper with 
the Free French and had learned not to 
fear death. But his face was drained of 
color when that door opened and he was 
forced out. 

"Stay here," he whispered. "Don't move 
from this spot." 

I had no intention of going anywhere. 
I remained sitting in the dark, desertc!d 
street with the cordon of soldiers surround-
ing the car. 

By the dim street light I could see ttiat 
they were young. These were ~t 
boys 
who belonged in the fields harvesting the 
rice. They looked at me defiantly. None 
of us existed as individuals. They were 
communist& fighting their revolutioo, and 
I was the imperialist foreign invader'. I felt 
both frightened and a little sad. 

Ten minutes later my companion r-. 
tUrned, still at the point of a bayoner.. & 
got into the car quickly and drove otf. 
"That fool almost killed me," he muttered 
under his breath. "He kept jabbing me ill 
the ribs with that damned thing while we 
were walking to the prison. Luckily there 
was an officer who spoke French and told 
him to release me. It's these dumb peasants 
you have to watch out for. All they know 
is tiahting and killing." 

There were no patrols around the 
Metropole. Inside, some Canadians and 
Indians had formed a barbershop quartet 
and were working on "Auld Lana Syne ... 
I could hear them singing as I walked up 
the dart stairs of the Coq D'or and looa 
after I had turned off the light.
