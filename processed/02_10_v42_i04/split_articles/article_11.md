EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the fourth floor of the Art Gallery, 
Suzanne Boorsch pulls a print from a black 
box labeled, "Unauthorized Reproduction, 
Tide: Laissez-Faire (Les Affaires)." 
Beneath a red sky, two men are fighting. 
One is faceless and the · other has a fedora. 
Both wear grey slacks and have giant, rug- · 
ged hands. To the left, a policeman turns 
his back to them; he is also wearing grey 
pants. The scene, with its swatches of color 
and bantering men, is comically straight-
forward: aimless rage and controlled pas-. 
sivity together on a single patch of water-
color cement. 

The work does not speak for itself-
or 
at least not entirely. Tucked under its matte 
is a note, written by one Ben Shawn, in or-
ange marker on a torn sheet of notebook 
paper, and it is even more blunt and con-
frontational than the work itself: 
The title (Les Affaires), substituted 
in panmtheses, is as phony as are the 
prints being sold by an unauthorized 
• • . original print, entitled 
2aissez-Faire~ was authorized by me to 
be made by two competent printmaker·s. 
7hey went out of business and sold their 
scr-eens to another· printmaker who has 
been printing them hor"l ibly and selling 
10 
them without any authorization from 
me whatsoever not to mention, without 
• 
any payments whatsoever. 

The phony print is one of about thir-
ty pieces of art fraud kept in the Prints, 
Drawing~, and Photographs Collection at 
the Yale University Art Gallery. The pieces 
are stored together in two airtight solander 
boxes, separated from sunlight, water, and, 
of course, authentic artwork. 

The set is varied. A few are obvious 
fakes, the words "Facsimile Reproduction" 
stamped in black across the back. Others 
don't declare their own disingenuousness 
so openly, and simply have "forgery shelf" 
written in pencil next to the work's year 
and medium. Their subjects are equally di-
. verse. One shows a grey charcoal ballerina 
sitting bent over with her head between her 
legs. She is oddly graceful, but you wonder 
if Rodin would have thought the same. To- · 
ward the bottom of one of the boxes is a 
large "Matisse" sketch of a woman with a 
floral blouse, and above it a simple painting 
that Suzanne, the Robert L. Solley Cura-
tor of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, 
finds entirely unappealing. "I don't know 
who would want this, even if it were a real 
Whistler!" she says, laughing as she lifts up 
the glassine paper covering the print. 

Yet within this collection, the grey and 
red print and the accompanying words of 
Ben Shawn stand out as a self-referential 
oddity, a work of forgery whose very sub-
ject matter is illegal behavior. In the print, 
after all, the policeman turns a blind eye 
to public disorderliness. It's a sarcastic al-
lusion to the piece's title, the principle that 
the government should not interfere with 
the action of individuals, especially in in-
dustrial affairs, trade, and, indeed, the forg-
ery of art. In a field where quotidian pro-
cesses of authentication are overshadowed 
by the mystery and sex appeal of a good art 
scandal, there is something strangely apt 
about a work that dares to be so blunt and 
matter-of-fact about the whole thing . 

Shawn's piece may be recent history, but 
documented art forgery dates back at least 
400 years. 

By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
the presence of art fraud, already pervasive 
throughout Germanic art, was spreading 
across the Europe. As Yale professor Chris-
topher Wood writes in his book Forgery, 
Replic~ Fiction, "an attitude of rational 
skepticism toward the truth claims of a 
document or a relic" developed extensively 


during the Medieval period. The idea of 
a fictional work, with a different claim to 
the truth than the original, had entered 
into the vernacular. 

From there, the history of art forgery 
began its long and seductive path to the 
fetishization of fakes and frauds in the 
modern day: the Vinland Map, an object 
of topographical intrigue housed in the 
Beinecke library and known around the 
world, discovered in 1965; the work of 
Hans van Meegeren, the rivalrous Dutch 
painter whose Vermeer-esque works · pro-
liferated in Holland during the Second 
World War; the constant presence of 
Dali and Rodin forgeries throughout the 
twentieth century market. Finding their 
way into our notions of art and decep-
tion, many of these scandals have become 
household names . 

Yet on a practical level, at the places 
where books and works of art are prized, 
these concerns are omnipresent. Institu-
tions such as Beinecke Library and the Yale 
University Art Gallery function alongside 
this history, their diligence and common 
sense acting as continuous procedural safe-
guards against fraud. 

Both institutions bring in massive num-
bers of acquisitions each year from a vari-
ety of sources. According to E. C. Schroed-
er, head of Technical Services at Beinecke 
Library, the facility acquires almost one 
thousand linear feet of manuscript mate-
rial and 15,000 books on an annual basis, 
ranging from 15th century texts to books 
published yesterday. It might seem easy for 
a fake to shuffie in along with the fray. 

Yet despite these numbers, Timothy 
Young, Curator of Modern Books and 
Manuscripts says that during his twenty 
years at the Beinecke the sea ndals have 
been few. "For those who want to hear 
about exciting fraud, it's a little boring," 
Young says. "None are terrifically upset-
ting or embarrassing." 

The reason for this, he suggests, is that 
the process of verification is in many ways 
built into the system, starting with the 
source of the acquired material. "When 
we are making a purchase, we go through 
dealers who are truly experienced," he ex-
pia ins. "If they make us an offer that's too 
good to be believed, then we don't believe 
it. 

When it comes to rare literature, Schro-
eder adds, due diligence is beneficial for 
both the bookseller and the library. "It's 
February 2010 
the bookseller's responsibility to make sure 
an item is real 
that's part of the service 
you're paying for, and it would hurt their 
business to make a mistake." Discussion 
about the provenance of an item, its physi-
cal properties, and the terms of sale are all 
negotiated before purchase. After acquisi-
tion, curators will carefully inspect new 
works, counting pages of books and cata-
loguing the contents of archives. 

But, as with all good systems, this one, 
too, has had its share of complications. 
Boorsch recalls one such time at the 
Gallery several years ago, when a 15th 
century print came on the market. "It 
was incredibly rare 
maybe one of four 
or five impressions known in the whole 
world and I thought if we could get it, 
the piece would be a wonderful acquisi-
tion." Boorsch and a paper conservator 
from the Gallery took the train to New 
York to look at the print, and found the 
paper and watermark to be historically ac-
curate. Yet Boorsch felt uneasy about the 
piece, and when she returned to work the 
next day she went through her own dusty 
drawers, only to find a photograph of an 
impression, known to be an original, ar-
chived in England. She noticed that this 
picture had the exact same nick on the top 
right corner of the page as the one at the 
auction house. This confirmed her unease: 
the "print," which was clearly a deliberate 
copy of an impression that was already ac-
counted for, was only as "original" as the 
photo she held in her hand. "We were very 
close to buying it," Boorsch says. "I had to 
go back and tell the dealer what I found." 

While the advancement of digital tech-
nologies has made the quality of facsimiles 
far more accurate and difficult to discern, 
curators often fall back on a much more 
old-fashioned tool for evaluating a work's 
authenticity: instinct. "When you've been 
working with drawings or prints or photo-
graphs for a while, you tend to develop al-
most a sixth sense for when things are off-
kilter," says Young. "You work with these 
objects for twenty years, and you can look 
at a book and say it looks like a book from 
1720. If it feels clean and shiny and pretty, 
how could it have survived 300 years?" 

Alex Nemerov, an Art History profes-
sor, agrees. "For a connoisseur of art, a lot 
matters in the first moment of perception," 
says An History professor Alex Nemerov. 
"However one responds in that instant, 
whatever the gut reaction is, it's bound to 
be right in some way." 

Yet even works that don't pass Nem-
erov's visceral test can have a place in the 
archives. 

At the Beinecke, Schroeder says, dubi-
ous materials can sometimes fall into step 
with the mission of the library itsel£ "They 
become objects of scholarly inquiry," he 
says. ''As long a.S they add to the research 
value of that collection." 

In the 1960s and 70s, for example, little 
booklets of poems by _Gertrude Stein and 
T.S. Eliot began to sell on the manuscript 
market. Curators started addirig them to 
collections, assuming that they had over-
looked these little "Butterfly Books." As 
more and more of these pamphlets ap-
peared, suspicions about their authenticity 
began to mount, and a novelist and Yale 
graduate named Frederic Prokosch soon 
admitted to having forged the booklets. Yet 
the admission didn't render the pamphlets 
worthless. They had already achieved an 
archival value all their own. "We have a 
complete set of them," says Young. "The 
objects have developed their own life"inde-
pendent of Stein or Eliot." 

Though the library errs on the side of 
keeping objects like the Butterfly Books 
that might add depth to future research, 
Young laments the possibility that forger-
ies outshine originals. "People are inter-
ested in fakes and forgeries but we have 
thousands of books that are amazing and 
unexplored, but there is real, deep scholar-
ship to be done with true artifacts of our 
cultural and publishing history." 

Suzanne and I have moved on to the 
second of the boxes, and toward the end 
we find a tan piece of drawing paper with 
a coffee stain in the bottom right corner. 
In the center is a hand-drawn frame, and 
inside it, a picture of George Washington. 
The pencil strokes are faint and simplistic; 
this Washington appears to be a man of 
contours over all else. Written below the 
portrait is the title, "Pencil sketch of Gen-
eral Washington from life taken by Chas. 
Wilson Peale, 1777." 

And directly below that, in compact 
cursive at the bottom of the sketch: 
"This was drawn by P. Tolman for me to 
show how easy it is to make a fake."
