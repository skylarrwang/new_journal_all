EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
New Haven, Bailey tells me how he spent 
all of his weekends in the spring knock-
. ing on doors trying to book jobs. If that 
was his only responsibility, he might have 
managed, but Bailey began marketing 
. while taking five courses and singing in 
one ofYale's. premier a cappella groups, the 
Baker's Dozen. 

"Needless to say, my academics suffered 
· a bit," he admits. "When I signed again for 
next summer, my dad didn't want me to be 
in school while I marketed so it was under-
stood that I would take the spring semester 
off. Then I decided to take the fall off as 
well to finish up my College Pro jobs from 
the summer." 

Other franchisees had less of an issue 
with the time management aspect of mar-
·keting than the ethical implications of sell-
ing a product they didn't believe in. 

"It's kind of sickening," says Dan Li, 
the Yale franchisee who terminated his 
contract with College Pro in June. "When 
I was marketing I had to go up to home 
owners with a shtick about helping college 
kids, when maybe I was a college kid but 
neither of my painters had ever been to 
college. One of them hadn't even gradu-
ated high··:school. And many of the paint-
ers are a lot older than your typical college 
kids." 

Tyler Schied, the Yale franchisee who 
quit before ever painting a house, agrees 
withLi. 

"Franchisees show up to the first day of 
production never having painted a day in 
their lives, with painters who have never 
painted a day in their lives, all the while 
marketing a 'professional' painting job," 
he says, the frustration rising in his voice. 
"College Pro is scamming kids that are 
scamming consumers. It's a total pyramid 
scheme top to bottom." 

At the bottom of that pyramid are the 
painters, most of whom were hired via 
Craigslist. According to Piasta and Bai-
ley, College Pro urges its franchisees to 
pay the painters $8 per hour, exactly the 
minimum wage in Connecticut, though 
many Yale franchisees report having pad-
ded their painters' salaries by a couple of 
dollars. 

If College Pro really is as exploitative 
as Schied and Li insisJ, it is interesting to 
consider what persuaded them and other 
Yale students to sign in the first place. 

"They never bring up the idea that 
you could fail at this, and that if you do 
February 20 1 0 
you could get yourself into a lot of debt," 
Schied explains angrily. "It's all in the con-
tract, but they gloss over all of the bad 
stuff so you're lulled into thinking, 'Oh 
man! My own little business. This is go-
ing to be fun!' All Jordan, the regional 
manager, does is paint this picture of Max 
Rhodes and how working for College Pro 
made him tons of money and won him his 
dream job at Bain. Of course my first in-
stinct was 'Where do I sign?'" 

Piasta points out that Yalies are par-
ticularly susceptible to the College Pro 
myth. "Corning out of Yale, you feel like 
because you're smart you'll be able to make 
everything work out," he says. "Yale kids 
inherently believe that they are incapable 
of actually failing at anything." 

Like Schied and Piasta, many Yale stu-
dents signed contracts with College Pro 
feeling confident that they could duplicate 
Max Rhodes' success. So far, none have 
come close, which raises the question: just 
how did Max Rhodes pull off what he did? 

Over the course of October and No-
vember, Rhodes and I exchange six sets of 
emails, each with him promising to call 
me or answer my questions by email and 
apologizing profusely for being a "bad 
.

)) 
Interviewee. 

I resort to tracking Rhodes on "Around 
the World in 100 Days," the blog he 
started (username: MaxtheYaliePainter) 
with his girlfriend to document their 
travels. Rhodes is handsome in an elfin 
sort of way - with high cheekbones, a 
devilish grin, and a haircut that looks like 
someone put a bowl over his blonde mop· 
and trimmed away what protruded. I flip 
through photos of the two lovebirds driv-
ing a rental car on the Autobahn, castle 
hopping in Prague and putting back pints 
ofbeer in Budapest. On October 14th, 
the couple stop blogging, but from o_ur 
email correspondence I know the pair also 
made it to D~lhi and Agra in India.

returned, Rhodes was living the dream of 
many Yale students. He just couldn't be 
• 
: bothered to talk about it. 

Since I couldn't pin down Rhodes him-
set£ I settled for talking to his Franchise 
:.Manager disciples, and to his customers. 
·}3oth groups agree that Rhodes' success is 
not undeserved. They testify that Rhodes 
: 
'w.orked 10-12 hour days and managed at 
least three crews of two to four painters 
~ at all points during the summer. By the 
end <?f the term he had painted 
or in 
,,.co~pany jargon, "produced" 
about 70 
r.houses, as compared to Bailey's 40 and 
;-Piasta's 12. _He's just ravenous," remarked 
. Schied. 

Rhodes also gets rave reviews from ho-
':meowners whose houses he painted. 
"Max was the most professional painter 
~ I ever worked with," says Jack Hitt, a 
_ freelance writer who owns a house on 
-East Rock road, one of the nicest streets 
in New Haven. "He was a crisp, well-
natured business man and a brilliant com-
. -municator. He· made a few mistakes but 
' was immediate to correct them." 

As I stand watching Piasta and Tom 
pack up their materials into Piasta's fam-
ily's minivan, which he had decorated 
with a College Pro Painters decal, I imag-
ine what I would be like as a College 
Pro Paintersfranchisee; I picture myself 
-in paint-blotched jeans, my Blackberry 
constantly vibrating as customers called to 
check in or complain. I envision waking 
up at five in the morning to run to the 
paint store and distribute the cans among 
my crews by seven. I imagine how my feet 
would ache after standing for 12 hours a 
, and how awful it would feel to fire a 
pamter. 

I sense myself being sucked in by the 
challenge of succeeding at something 
where so many have failed, the possibility 
that I could be the next Max Rhodes. 
I could do this. I catch myself thinking. 
Frank begins to descend from his perch 
on the ladder when suddenly the sole 
of one of his Timberlands slips, and he 
misses a rung. The ladder momentarily 
comes off the side of the building before 
clattering back against the house. 
"Close call," I say, and mean it.
