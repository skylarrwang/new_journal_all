THE LETTER OF THE LIE 
Like most people who reach the age of76, 
Ana Kyle is set in her beliefs. A handwrit-
ing analyst, she does not care much for 
email. She has no doubts that personality 
can be divined through penstrokes. And 
she believes, beyond conversion, that the 
fifteen ransom notes in the 1932 Lind-
bergh kidnapping case were written by 
American novelist Thomas Wolfe. On the 
last count, she's not in good ~ompany. 

In the winter of 1935, the toddler 
son of aviator-socialites Charles Lind-
bergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh was 
snatched from the couple's New Jersey 
home, and a peculiar ransom note riddled 
with spelling rn istakes and grammatical 
errors was left in his place. As the search 
for Lindbergh, Jr. continued, so, too, 
did the influx of mysterious missives. 
The notes ultimately totaled more than 
1,700 words 
all of them, of course, 
handwritten. Thus, what journalist H.L 
Mencken called "the biggest s~ory since 
the Resurrection" was of particular inter-
est to handwriting specialists. Seven such 
experts were employed during the trial. 

Kyle's daily work as a-handwriting 
specialist was decidedly less glamorous: 
examining quick claim deeds, wills, and 
February 20 10 
checks under magnification for the.rypes 
of retouching and wavering that indicate 
forgery isn't quite front-page news. But 
14 years into the job, Kyle's interest was 
called to the Lindbergh case and she 
started spending much of her free time 
researching it. She began transferring 
trial transcripts and microfiche notations 
from The Yale Library and The National 
Ar:chive in Washington to her little house 
in Hamden, gathering evidence for her 
growing conviction that the jury, which 
sentenced German Bruno Hauptmann to 
death in 1935, had condemned an inno-
cent man. So began a project that would 
consume her for twenty-three years. 

"These ransom notes read like a story," 
Kyle says of the handwritten messages, 
copies of which she has framed on the 
wall of her study. The first clue that 
pushed Kyle toward her conspiracy theory 
(and the subject of her self-published 
book "The Dead Poets Plus One") was 
the notes' misspellings 
redy, mony, 
shal, gete, wo. "An immigrant who can 
barely speak English?" Kyle asks, referring 
to Hauptmann. Her doubt is palpable. 
She pulls the The Complete Works of 
Chaucer from her bookshelf: "These are 
all words from The Canterbury Tales." 
Kyle indicates other match-ups between 
the text of the notes and texts by Donne 
and Milton. These concordances convince 
Kyle that some man of letters, motivated 
by "money and the desire to deceive the 
world," had been hired by the Lindbergh 
ring to write the notes. 

As Kyle's case spins out, it gets weirder. 
After surveying the handwriting of 
major literary figures of the time, she 
landed on Thomas Wolfe, the early 20th 
century author most famous for Look 
HomewardAngel. Wolfe's handwriting 
does look markedly similar to the hand-
writing of the ransom notes and Kyle 
finds other links. Wolfe graduate from 
Harvard; Lindbergh's lawyer graduated 
where Wolfe made his home. Misspellings 
from the ransom notes 
"efery day'' and 
"wronk" 
appear in a story, "One of the 
Girl in Our Party," that Wolfe was writing 
at the time of the kidnapping. 

The more Kyle talks about her theory, 
the more she uses the word "they." She 
bought six copies of the Wolfe novel 
From Death to Morning, because she was 
worried "they" would destroy it. Wolfe 
himself was not a killer; "they" hired him 
to write the notes without telling him 
what they were going to do. The hand-
writing on a note from Hauptmann to his 
broker looks different from his marriage 
certificate used in the trial: evidence that 
"they" had Wolfe reletter the document to 
implicate the young German. In 1998, 
Thomas Wolfe's old home went up in 
flames. Who was responsible? They were. 
She keeps a leg up on "them" by 
imagining an intricate life for Wolfe by 
memorizing passages of his work, keeping 
the forger in her grasp by becoming inti-
mately familiar with his biography. 

"They can do a lot," she warns, carry-
ing a stack of handwriting manuals back 
to her bookshelÂ£ "But they can't change 
Wolfe."
