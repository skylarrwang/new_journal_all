One player remembers feeling left out of the huddle. 
. 
It was August and hot. The air teemed with 
the testosterone-fueled excitement of pre-
season. I had signed up for my West Hart-
ford public high school's football team 
with about fifty other freshmen, who, like 
myself, had been coaxed into helmets and 
pads by nostalgic fathers and then prod-
ded into huddles by even more nostalgic 
coaches. I was terrified, but eager to prove 
mysel£ 
Some of the other players on the· team 
had been hiking footballs since the Pee 
Wees, but this was my first time on the 
field. I didn't even know the positions or 
the rules. Though I quickly committed 
those to memory, it quickly became clear 
how little I really knew about the game 
when I found myself week after week on 
the ground, breathless and coughing up 
dirt. 
Football, I soon learned, was about 
a different set of rules. It was not about 
knowing that a safety earned two points 
or that a touchback meant that the offense 
received the ball at the 20-yard line. Rath-
er, it was about the preening and prancing My tendency my need

hit, each perfect spiral shapes our idealized 
notions about masculinity, our expecta-
tions of how 
and who 
a man should 
be. 

But I didn't have dreams of becoming 
a star quarterback, of leading my team to 
state championships, trophy on one arm, 
prom queen on the other. No, football was 
something much less romantic for me. I 
was gay and closeted. 

I never fully subscribed to the style and 
protocols of my teammates. I did not par-
ticipate in the sexist banter or the postur-
ing, I hid from the fiercest coaches, and I 
left immediately after practice was over to 
avoid the locker-room towel snapping-
sweaty, dirt-caked and unshowered. I took 
pains to remove myself from any situation 
where my masculinity might be scruti-
nized and where my true feelings might 
be exposed. I spent most of my time with 
the team trying to forget I was there in the 
hope that everyone else would, too. 

This is not to say that I was miserable 
throughout the season. I enjoyed the com-
petition of the sport and the opportunity 
it provided for me to stay in shape. But 
when I signecl up again sophomore year, 
I doubt it was the sprints, or the cama-
raderie, or our nearly undefeated season 
that compelled me to keep playing. More 


likely, it was the fas;ade of normalcy that 
playing football allowed me to present. Ev-
eryday after school that I suited up in pads 
and ran out on the field ensured that my 
manliness 
and, by extension, my sexual-
ity 
could not be questioned-off the field. 

When I came out to my straight male 
friends from high school during my fresh-
man year of college, one of them remarked 
that any speculation about my sexual ori-
entation was quelled by my membership 
on the team. Football had been my closet. 
Football still has, in my mind, an intoxi-
cating allure. It has become my point of 
retreat, my place of solace. 
It's my de-
fense mechanism. Whenever I feel that my 
manliness has been called into question, 
_ whenever I hear a homophobic remark or 
am unfairly stereotyped, I conjure up my 
football days. "You think I'm weak? You 
think I'm a sissy? Are you calling me a fag-
got? Let me tell you something," I imagine · 
myself saying. "I played football in high 
school." Every time my voice slips into af-
fect, or I profess my love for Lady Gaga, 
wear deep v-neck t-shirts, or spend just a 
moment too long shopping for shoes, it's 
okay, I r~mind those present, because "I 
..... 
played football in high school." 

I have to admit, I'm reminding myself, 
too. I refer to my high school football days 
with such frequency that it has become an 
inside joke among my friends. After all, I 
had only played for two years and never 
even made it to varsity. But though my 
friends and I kid about my frequent refer-
ences to my football days, ~omethirig se-
rious underlies them: my insecurities and 
the societal constructs that helped produce 
them. My tendency 
my need 
to fall 
back on football reflects the misconcep-
tion in our society that equates masculin-
ity with heterosexuality. 

I only understand my repeated allusion to 
my high school football days in terms of 
a combination of pride and self-loathiJ?.g. 
Pride for the small rebellions I unleash 
against heteronormativity every time I 
strut into the gym with my high school 
football sweatshirt on, mentioning all of 
the squats and the deadlifts and the tackle 
drills and the suicides that I did; pride for 
the knowledge that I -defy stereotypes, that 
I contribute a modicum of "normality" to 
an identity all too often deemed abnormal. 

But also self-loathing. Self-loathing for

defining myself in terms of an arbitrary 
notion of normal; for thinking about how 
manly I appear to others every -time I walk 
down the street with another man's hand 
in my own, or dance with a man at Toad's, . 
or sleep with a man; self-loathing for the 
knowledge that I am undeniably differ-
ent no matter how hard I hit, how much 
I benched, how fast I ran a 40-meter split. 
·rm gay whether or not I played football 
in high school. Nothing can change that, 
not even a two-year stint of heavy-hitting, 
or rough-and-ready cover. What really 
matters then is not that I played football, 
but that I don't play it anymore. I left that 
locker-room and unsuited those pads a 
long time ago. And I am all the more a · 
man for it.
