ANIMATION NATION 
Sometimes people fly. Sometimes they 
yell. Sometimes they fight, with their 
feet and their fists, pounding faces. Their 
viewing eyes are enormous 
some opened wide 
and round like cherries, others pointier, 
almond shaped. There are monsters, on 
occasion, space creatures or enormous 
polo 
pants spiders that bleed maroon juices and 
snarl. Sometimes there are magical elks

light on dark streets. Sometimes there are 
swords and sometimes there's sex. There 
. are·subtitles, in English. If there weren't, 
you couldn't catch a word. We're watch-
ing imported cartoons, shipped through 
the television waves from Japan. It's An-
ime. Anime, in Japanese, simply means 
"animation." For the most part, Anime 
seems like your average Saturday Morning 
Cartoon. They're often based on Manga 
Qapanese comics), just as the Batman 
and Spiderman series are based on Marvel 
Comics. With a little television magic, the 
pictures move. The sketches come ih. all 
shapes and shades. They're the flat pastels 
of Care Bears and the primary hues of 
Loony Tunes~ 

Yale Anime Society is watching its 
weekly episode of Cowboy Be Bop in the 
basement of Branford College. Here at 
their "viewing circle," there are ten or so 
figures in hoodies and polo shirts, cargo 
pants and skirts. Nobody says hi. Shuf-
fling in at 9:30 pm, I'm late, and they're 
already engaged, save for one young man 
in the back, who is happily brandishing 
a homemade wooden sword, and his vic-
tim, who is playfully punching him back. 
Jazz music slips from the speakers, and 
there's a rocky spacescape on the screen. 

· The Anime Society's oldest member, . 
a graduate student named Josh, explains 
the show to me in whispers from his spot 
on a black leather couch. Somebody tells 
us to be quiet, but Josh responds that 
he's "pulling rank" as a Viewing Circle 
veteran and keeps talking. Cowboy Be 
Bop, he explains, a "genre skipping space 
western." Each episode of action packed 
fighter jets and busty romance is set to a 
different .musical theme. Tonight there are 
trombones and saxophones making the 
space cowboys' shuttleships dance. 

The Anime Society is an accomplished 
bunch 
they are political junkies, stu-
dents of literature, philosophers and 
musicians 
but tonight they're letting 
their eyes turn blue from the screen, let-
ting their serious daytime world morph 
into sornething utterly fantastical. You 
can see the reflection of the cartoon in a 
few pairs of glasses. Fernando, a senior 
member, molds his body into the couch 
as the spaceship lands, and Josh's body is 
tense in observation, muscles rubberband 
taut as he watches a man hop out of the 
ship and onto the bumpy gray surface of

some distant planet. Alex, a sophomore, 
has her computer on her lap, trying to 
manage homework and viewing· simul-
taneously, but she's rapt at the screen·. ' ' 

In this moment, nobody's a student any 
longer -they're all bystanders to a drama 
that cannot be missed. By now, they're all 
standing on spacerock themselves, and 
they all fall silent. 

In life, darkness looms one inch away

The Anime man is wearing a red 
coat. He is our hero. He rushes towards 
another young mari, who is lying flat on 
the crater-land, gasping, big eyes pulled 
flat into thin, tired lines. Our hero looks 
on~ kneeling, worried. In the back of the 
Branford television room, the boy with · 
his sword has stopped trying to hit his 
friend. A couple to my left moves closer, 
links arms. 

But back on the screen, the man lying 
prone is now just barely talking, exhaust-
ed from battle. It had been a spacerocket 
fight, with yellow explosions and grey 
smoke, loud snaps and swishes and bangs. 
His spacecraft damaged, he was forced to 
attempt a crash landing but botched it. 
He's hurt. 

In his last moments, he tells the red-
coated hero about Julia, someone they 
both know and miss, and both maybe 
love; too. 

"Where is she now?" our hero 
asks. The dying man does not respond, 
but he speaks in whispers of the woman. 
He remembers her from bygone days, 
there, in the corner seat of the bar. "She 
always sat there .... she always requested 
the same song, and smiled, sadly ... 
smiled." It's a cliffhanger. The men's faces 
fade. 

As the jazz slows, we see a campfire 
back on planet earth, we're quickly 
shuttled back to reality with the glaring 
stereotype: there's an American Indian 
chief crosslegged in wild regalia, headdress 
and all, talking to a little boy. They see a 
shooting star. 

"That is no ordinary star," the cheiftan 
says, ponderous. "It is the tear of a war-
rior. He who has finished his battle some-
where on the planet." 

The scene pans out with the campfire 
smoke, to the sky over rockcliffs, then the 
sunset, and the jazz gets lonelier, and the 
credits roll. "Next Episode On Cowboy 
Be Bop," the screen in Branford flashes. 
Cryptic subtitles to prepare us for the in-
stallment to come: 
away with us?"
