One man's mission to dress people up without selling out . 

Animal heads surround me. They are 
stacked on shelves, falling off of coun-
ters, staring at me with oversized cartoon 
eyes. I start reaching out to feel the top of 
a panda's head when my ·guide appears in 
the entrance from the parking lot, stomp-
ing his feet to get rid of the snow on his 
boots and leaning a shovel against the 
doorway. "Those?" he asks with a nod to 
my furry acquaintances. "We have about 
200 of them. And that doesn't include our 
97 bunnies." 

Meet Jeff Russell, the owner of Cos-
tume Bazaar, a cavernous store on State 
Street that is stuffed with costumes, mas-
cots, face paints, and assorted oddities .. In 
his baseball cap and a drab pullover, Jeff 
stands in stark contrast to the sequined 
mannequins around him_, but he walks 
through the room with an air of comfort 
and confidence that makes it clear he feels 
at home. He ushers me past a row of glit-
ter-encrusted ruby slippers down a set of 
stairs painted to match the yellow brick 
road, and into his office . 

Once inside, the magic falls away. There 
are no bright colors, no showy masks. The 
clutter of costumes upstairs has given way 
to a different kind of mess downstairs;-
Jeff's cubicle is completely covered with 
pictures of family members, playbills, 
and hockey memorabilia. As we talk, Jeff 
peers over my head at a t.iny television; the 
Olympics are on, and, he informs me, he 
knows several players on the U.S. men's 
hockey team. Before becoming the own-
er of Costume Bazaar, Jeff was a college 
hockey player himsel£ He also spent time 
as a sports director on an AM station, and 
a public relations coordinator for a profes-
sional hockey team, and is the inventor 
of the foam goalie pads now in use in the 
NHL And though becoming the propri-
etor of a costume store may not seem like 
the most logical professional choice for 
someone with Jeff's resume, it was a career 
move that came as no surprise to his par-
ents. After all, Costume Bazaar is his faro-
ily's business. Jeff's mother, Joan, founded 
the store in 1964 . 

Prior to then, Joan spent much of her 
time making costumes for her husband, 
Joey Russell, who played the title charac-
ter of the Colonel Clown Show, popular at 
the time on regional television stations. He 
needed clown suits and Santa suits, which 
were also coveted by department stores in 
the area, and so the Russells began adding 
to a..J.d renting out their collection. They 
acquired Easter Bunnies, too, and kept 
them in piles in their garage. Soon, even 
neighbors and acquaintances began asking 
for costumes, and Joan opened up a small 
shop to handle the demand.
