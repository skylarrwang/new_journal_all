On Saturday, February 6th, Toad's was 
raided by police. If you're envisioning a 
SWAT team of NHPD officers infiltrat-
ing every entrance of the (in)famous New 
Haven dance club and going LAPD on 
the unsuspecting revelers inside, you'll be 
disappointed. The reality was far less dra-
matic: the music stopped; someone turned 
on the lights, and a few cops surveyed the 
dance floor for minors. Two underage 
patrons who neglected to put down their 
drinks were busted for consuming alcohol 
and potentially using false identification. 

This is nothing Toad's hasn't seen be-
fore. Eighty-seven Toad's-goers were de-
tained when the nightclub was raided 
back in November 2005. The ordeal 
landed Toad's a $90,000 fine and a 90-day 
forced suspension during the summer of 
2007 after the case was finally settled. But 
for current Yalies, many of whom forget 
that they're not legally permitted to drink 
as soon as they set foot on Old Campus, 
this intensification of police activity comes 
as a surprise in an otherwise lax drinking 
environment. Toad's in particular seemed 
to have successfully evaded police scru-
tiny when it began admitting 19 and 20 
year olds in an effort to <:urb fake ID use 
in January of last year. However, this most 
recent incident may be just one part of a 
larger crackdown on underage drinking

and fake ID use by police in the greater 
New Haven area. 

Symptoms of an intensified response by 
both Yale and New Haven police emerged 
last semester, perhaps in reaction to an ab-
normally high number of alcohol-related 
hospitalizations. The Yale Daily News re-
ported that several students who purchased 
alcohol on Halloween weekend were ap-
proached by the police after leaving vari-
ous liquor stores. Those caught possessing 
alcohol as minors had their liquor seized 
and some were slapped with hefty fines . 

In that weekend alone, the total number 
of citations issued last semester by the Yale 
police tripled, and this heightened police 
activity ensued for weeks thereafter. An-
other, slightly more fortunate Yale student 
who wishes to remain anonymous reports 
that his fake ID got scanned the weekend 
of the Harvard-Yale football game at a li-
quor store where it had always worked be-
fore. He was denied, and when he stepped 
outside empty-handed the police who 
had been watching from across the street 
searched his backpack for the alcohol that 
he had luckily not been able to buy. 

Such stories have become somewhat 
foundational to the American college ex-
perience 
a staple of being a "not-quite-
adult" in a country with one of the highest 
drinking ages in the world. For the nearly 
three quarters of college students who are 
under the legal drinking age, fake IDs are 
almost commonplace. Part of the success 
of the 2007 comedy Superbad was its 
ability to so beautifully (and hilariously) 
capture a feeling to which many young 
Americans can relate: buying alcohol with 
a fake ID for the first time. But exactly 
how many McLovins are nervously finger-
ing through their wallets at bars and liquor 
stores around Yale? Who has fake IDs? 
Where do they get them? And do they 
work? Do Yale students' smarts make them 
more likely to curl up with a book than 
to seek out cheap, alcohol-induced thrills 
on a Saturday night before they are of the 
appropriate age? Or has that same cunning 
made them equally well versed at decep-
tion, seeking refuge from endless Cold 
War reading at the bottom of a handle of Â· 
Popov? 

A survey of more than 200 Yale stu-
dents suggests that the number of under-
age Yalies with fake IDs is higher than one
