Since then, the shop has moved loca-
tions four times and expanded its invento-
ry considerably 
it's now a 15,000 square 
foot ,J:>ehernoth roughly twice the size of 
Toads. As Jeff leads me through the store, 
I learn that the animal heads that greeted 
me earlier in the day were just the begin-
ning. Behind a cuttain marked "Employ-
ees Orily," I find racks and racks and racks 
of dresses, tuxedoes, and plastic crowns. 
"We own about 40,000 costumes/' Jeff 
says with a wave of his hand. Costume Ba-
zaar is not for the indecisive. "We ask them 
to zero. in a bit ahead of time. Look at our 
website, email us with preferences, just to 
get their wheels spinning," Jeff answers. 
But the Internet is not always a boon for 
the Bazaar, he explains. While people still 
enjoy coming into the shop to try on apd 
buy costumes, they also arrive with a pre-
set sense of their desires based on the im-
age searches that they have already done. 

"If someone saw an Alice in Wonderland 
costume with a white shirt online, that's all 
they want. Never mind that you have the 
perfect costume with an off-white shirt." 
Overall, though, "coming here is not like 
going to the dentist or the accountant. 
People come in here in a good mood." 
The back of the store contains a sew-
ing area with stacks offabric that will be 
used for the custom costumes the store 
produces for theat.er companies. Though 
these troupes represent· the bulk of the 
store's long-term cl.ientele, they are hardly 
the Bazaars only major customers. Corpo-
. rate rentals are important too: G.E., for 
example, dresses up about 100 volunteers 
annually for its employee holiday party. 
Additionally, celebrations throughout the 
year such as Purim and Mardi Gras cre-
ate small spikes in demand. But nothing, 
of course, can outdo the seasonal rush of 
Halloween, 

For that holiday, Costume Bazaar packs 
its basement with retail goods and dam-
aged costumes that trick-or-treaters can 
buy off the rack instead of renting. Hal-
loween accounts for 25 percent of the 
store's annual gross income, and between 
Labor Day and Halloween, Jeff works sev-
en days a week to meet the demand. I ask 
if he is ever shocked by what people come 
up with, and he slowly shakes his head. 
"After a while, nothing surprises me." He 
motions to a bright, floor-length purple 
gown: "This could be the 40th time I have 
seen a guy putting on a purple dress for 


Halloween has become an even harder 
market to corner. In· recent years, there has 
been a growth in competition from 'tem-
porary stores that set up in empty store-
fronts for the two months before the holi-
day and disappear right afterwards. Two 
years ago, he counted 19 of them within 
seven miles of the Bazaar, and the industry 
is only expanding. He acknowledges that 
they are savvy from a profit perspective, 
but reminds me that he pays taxes year-
round and is part of a core. community of 
New Haven store owners whose rhythms 
are disrupted by these new arrivals. 
'~It's 
been a bigger challenge recently. They defi-
nitely take away from our gr~vy." 

He also hints at changes in the de-
mographics of his clientele and, noting 
a couple of racy Red Riding Hood cos-
tumes, I press him for more ~nformation. 
"Halloween used to be a kids' industry. 
Now, we target 18- to 30-year-old girls. 
Dressing up and the fantasy involved have 
become part of our culture, and its 'the 
sexier the better."' Young women, then, 
account for about four out of every ten 
dollars spent on Halloween costumes, and 
they also provide a bonus: almost all of the 
girls· b.dng at least two or three friends to 
provide feedback or shop for themselves. 
Still, Jeff made a personal decision to re-
move the adult novelty section from the 
store wh~n his kids became old enough to 
visit. Jeff feels the financial reverberations 
of that decision, especially considering the 
popularity of Very Intimate Pleasures, or 
V.I.P, an adult-themed store close by. Does 
he think people ever use Costume Ba-
zaar for more inature self-entertainment? 
"I guess some are clean, some are not so 
clean," he tells me. "40 years ago, people 
did things like that discreetly. Now, they 
want a public shock factor at a whole dif-
ferent level." The potential profits, he as-
sures me, are not worth the cost of having 
his children or anyone else's children find 
something inappropriate in their father's 
store. The potential profits, he assures me, · 
are not worth the cost of having his chil-
dren find anything inappropriate in their 
'father's store. After all, they can always· put 
the adult room back when Costume Ba-
. 
' 
zaar belongs to them.
