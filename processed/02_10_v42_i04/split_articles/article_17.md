6. As residents of eight-person suites, 
we attest that we are never bothered, nor 
even a little perturbed, by the occasional 
stranger crashing on our futons, or even 
the occasional stranger still crashed on 
our futons after Sunday brunch with wine 
stains all over his shirt. If we don't know 
him, he must be someone else's friend! So, 
when you're ready to turn in for the night, 
simply gain access to the entryway (see 
below) of one ofYale's bigger suites 
the 
TD octet, the Welch 12-pack, or President 
Levin's house, just to name a few 
and 
make yourself at home on its common 
room futon. 

7. To gain access to a residential col-
lege or entryway, the would-be impostor 
can try simply standing outside the door 
begging passerby to swipe him in. Don't 
worry about giving yourself away: Yalies 
do this all the time. To get into Davenport 
without an ID this morning, the process 
lasted just 57 seconds 
and it only took 
that long because our enabler kept her ID 
in an especially cavernous purse. A second 
attempt to get from outside the gate and 
into an entryway lasted just 49.57 seconds. 

8. Some impostors have reportedly suc-
ceeded in finding temporary housing in 
Yale's 22 libraries. Bass is open to the pub-
lic until 6 p.m. If one is willing to wait it 
out, it is said that sleeping in a weenie-bin 
can be quite comfY. 

9. Would-be impostors are advised to 
check out free, open late-night parties 
thrown by Yale frats on Thursdays (SAE) 
and Saturdays (DKE). Frat brothers at 
the door check Yale IDs, but how difficult 
could it be, really, to get in as a non-Yalie? 
"Depends," says one SAE brother. "Male 
or female non-Yalie? We check IDs, but 
when it comes to girls, we turn a blind 
eye." But don't be disheartened, male

10. If you really can't live without your 
studies, impostor, just sneak into the back 
of a big lecture. No one will care. Report-

**The $60,000 Summer: A Yale Painting Saga**
**Page number(s): 21**

' 
In 2008, a Yale senior made close to 
$60,000 in one summer painting houses. 
As fantastical as it may sound, especially 
to the many Yale students who see ener-
vating banking and consulting internships 
as the only way to make m<?ney over the 
summer, the story of Max Rhodes '09 is 
no fairy tale. 

In an article, seductively titled "Rhodes 
'09 earns big with paint," published in the 
Yale Daily News last February, Rhodes 
described how he spent the summer of 
2008 running a painting business through 
a contracting company called College Pro 
Painters. He conceded that it is "not an 
easy job, and it can go horribly wrong 
if the wrong person is set to do it." But 
then, as if to suggest that there are very few 
"wrong" people for the job, he launched 
into a lengthy list of his previous failures, 
as if to say "If I did it, anyone can. I wasn't 
successful with much before I worked 
with College Pro. I didn't make the debate 
team, didn't get into the a capella group I 
tried out for, and got rejected from tour 
guiding. College Pro really gave me an op-
portunity to reinvent myself" 

And, if Yale students needed any more 
reason to be intrigued, Rhodes also cred-
ited his experiences with College Pro for 
helping:him secure a job at Bain & Com-
pany, the prestigious consulting firm, after 
graduation. 

$60,000 of income in a single sum1ner? 
A resume bullet so impressive it commands 
a job at Bain? An opportunity for an every-
man to transform into an ubermench? 
Yale students were sold. 

Frank Piasta, YC '09, is perched on the top 
rung of a ladder leaning against a large, 
Victorian house in New Canaan. Orna-
mental carvings, intricate spiral railings 
and terraces abound -
a painter's night-
mare. Frank, however, seems unfazed. He 
swishes his brush methodically across the 
slats, adding to the Jackson Pollack-esque 
splatters on his "College Pro Painters" t-
shirt. 

Piasta graduated last spring from Yale, 
where he played on the soccer team with 
Max Rhodes, the College Pro legend who 
also graduated in Yale's class of 2009. 
When Piasta struggled to find a job after 
graduation, Rhodes suggested he sign as 
a Franchise Manager with College Pro for 
the summer to pick up some extra money 
and supplement his resume before search-
ing for a permanent JOb. Piasta thought he 
had hit the jackpot. 

"Max talked about how cool it was to 
run your own business and made it seem 
like it would be easy to make a lot of mon-
ey," Piasta recalls with a sarcastic guffaw. 
This afternoon, it's easy to see-that reality's 
set in. "If you had showed up 20 minutes 
ago you would have really had a story." 

As I watch him touch up second-floor 
window frames, Piasta launches into a sto-
ry 
just one of many he has to undermine 
the Rhodes College Pro myth. Laughing, 
he tells me about how one of his painters, 
whom he'd found on Craigslist.com, had 
decided to put that morning's pay towards 
a liquid lunch of Captain Morgan. Piasta 
was watching the clock, wondering why 
his painter was an hour late to come back 
from a 30-minute break, when a police 
car pulled up and discharged the mum-
bling tippler on the steps of the work site: 
He had been found, the police told him, 
passed out on the steps of an assisted liv-
• mg center. 

"Of course I fired him immediately," 
Piasta assures me. "But it's crazy! Working · 
for College Pro is very much to be in the 
real world. You interview your painters, 
but you can't really tell what they'll be like 
until they show up at production. You re-
ally have to look out for yourself, because 
nobody else is." 

Not even College Pro Painters. 

Piasta is one of fourteen current and re-
cently graduated Yale 
students 
who 
worked as Franchise Managers for College 
Pro Painters this past summer. Instead of 
fetching coffee for their bosses at intern-
ships in New York or Hong Kong, these 
students were the bosses. They focused 
mainly on marketing, hiring painters and 
managing production, leaving the dirty 
work to hired employees. But when I vis-
ited Piasta's final worksite in late Septem-
ber, he and Tom, another member ofYale's 
class of 2009 who had run a College Pro 
franchise that summer who asked that his 
real name not be used for this article, were 
in fact the only painters. 

Piasta was looking to save himself the $8 
or $9 an hour he typically paid to employ-
ees by painting himself and using only two 
other painters: Mr. Captain Morgan, who 
had been let go earlier that afternoon, and 
Tom. Tom, a friend of Piasta's from Yale, " 
was painting to pick up a little extra cash 
as College Pro the ul-
before moving to Manhattan to search for 
a finance job. He had closed out his busi-
ness the week before, barely breaking even 
after ten weeks on the job. 

"It didn't really work out as well for me 
as it did for other people," remarks Tom 
of his experience as a Franchise Manager 
while he picks at paint splotches on his 
Yale sweatshirt. "But regardless, the idea of 
running your own business at our· age is 
pretty incredible." 

Tom was not alone in his struggles. Six 
of the 14 Yale students who bought Col-
lege Pro_ franchises last summer termi-
nated their contracts early and were left in 
debt 
in one case for more than $7,000. 
Of those who lasted the summer, mo~t . 
made money, but nobody's earnings . ap-
proached what Rhodes had grossed the 
summer before. 

Operating in 32 states and seven Cana-
dian provinces, College Pro Painters is a 
painting contracting company that hires 
mostly students and recent graduates to 
run their own painting businesses. Before 
Rhodes' first stint at the company in sum-
mer 2008, College Pro Painters was not a 
popular presence on campus -
especially 
wheri compared to ubiquitous banking 
and consulting heavyweights like Gold-
man Sachs and McKinsey. 

But when last February turned to 
March and March sent most unemployed 
Yalies into a frenzy about last minute sum-
mer plans, suddenly the name "College 
Pro Painters" started popping up every-
where. And rumors did too. 

You get to run your own business! Did you 
hear about that Max Rhodes kid? You can 
make lots of money! He got a job with Bain 
because of it! It can't be that hard - it's just 
painting. 

Were you to Google "College Pro Paint-
ers" you would find that the two top 
searched results were "College Pro Paint-
ers Complaints" and "College Pro Painters 
Scam" - both clocking in with over 15,000 
pages. One reads "College Pro Painting 
took me out of college, put me in debt 
and almost ruined my life." Similar hits 
abound: "I need help guys! I'm caught in 
a College Pro scam!" The description for a 
Facebook group titled "College Pro Paint-
ers is Exploiting College Students" reads as 
follows:
