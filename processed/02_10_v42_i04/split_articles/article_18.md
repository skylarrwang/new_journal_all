the whole summer without pay, or maybe 
even made some money but not the 15, 000 
to 20, 000. they said you would earn, then 
this group is for you. 

3. The public needs to know!! These students 
think that by working 40-hour weeks or 
more that they will be able to help with the 
costs of a completing a college degree, but it 
is not the case when College Pro Painters is 
the employer. 

4. Please do not be afraid to stand up!! 
I now had two completely conflicting ac-
counts of College Pro. Was it the ultimate 
opportunity, or the ultimate mistake? And 
if it was a mistake, how did Max Rhodes 
make a killi~g working for the company? 
I decided to work from the ground up, 
learning about the process of running 
a College Pro franchise from signing to 
closeout, scraping the false rumors away 
from the truths like paint off a peeling 
house. 
I started from the inside. 

When we talk on the phone to set up a 
meeting, Joe Cunliffe, the Vice President 
of College PrO's New England branch, 
sounds strangely suspicious. "What ex-
actly do you plan to write about?" he asks. 
''And who exactly have you talked to?" I 
run down the list- making sure to inter-
sperse the names of those who had positive 
reviews of College Pro with those whose 
assessments were less than glowing. 
"Wow. Yup, you've gotten to pretty much 
all of our guys," Cunliffe says. 
I ask to be put in contact with College 
Pro's regional manager for Connecticut, 
Jordan Driediger, who has had the most 
direct interaction with the Yale franchi-
sees. Cunliffe refuses. "Lets just see what 
we can get through first," he says genially, 
dismissing the idea without rejecting it 
outright. He possesses the practiced finesse 
of a true salesman. 

When we meet in person, at the Star-
bucks where he interviews Yale College 
Pro applicants, Cunliffe is only slightly 
less reserved. He is professional, carry-
ing a brown leather portfolio and sport-
ing a navy sweater and khakis. Only 27, 
he speaks with conviction and confidence 
of someone much older. But his baby-face 
and mousy brown hair lend him an unex-
pected and youthful softness. 
I start by asking Cunliffe to walk me 
through the process of hiring an applicant 
- how does College Pro recruit its franchi-
sees? How do they convince a recruit that 
buying a College Pro franchise is a good 
idea? What qualities do they look for in a 
franchisee? 

Given the company's tide, I was sur-
prised when he told me that one of the 
answers to my last question was not that 
the applicant is a college student. Though 
the company's website boasts "When you 
choose us, you are investing in the career 
path of young entrepreneurs through real-
world business experiences," there is not 
actually an age or educational requirement 
in order to become a College Pro franchi-
see or painter. In fact, a few of the Fran-
chise Managers and many of the painters 
hired by College Pro have never attended 
college. 

Cunliffe explains that the company's 
name stems not from the fact that Col-
lege Pro Painters hires only college stu-
dents, but that it was founded by a college 
student in 1971. Applicants are assessed 
based on eight criteria, he tells me - lead-
ership qualities, organization, strong val-
ues, tenaciousness, instrumental ability 
(the combination of being able to speak 
well, to present, and to do math), the abil-
ity to handle stress and emotions, the abil-
ity to set (and hit) goals, and the ability to 
understand oneself and others. 
"We interview twenty...:two applicants for 
every hire that we make," he boasts. 
One past franchisee, however, speculates 
that College Pro is not as selective as Cun-
liffe claims. "Jordan signed anyone who 
wanted to sign," says Dan Li, a former 
franchisee who graduated from Yale last 
spring. 

Li is referring to Jordan Driediger, the 
General Manager for College Pro's New 
England Brach who is responsible for 
signing all of the franchisees in the New 
England area. "By law, College Pro is sup-
posed to make potential franchisees hold 
the Franchise Disclosure Document for 
two weeks before they accept it," Li says, 
explaining that the Franchise Disclosure 
Document includes the contract as well as 
all pertinent information regarding Col-
lege Pro Painters. "I signed in 48 hours 
and they back dated the contract, stamp-
ing a date that was twelve days earlier than 
I had actually signed. I guess you can say 
I was overeager but that's the point of the 
fourteen day wait." 

Li, who terminated his contract with 
College Pro in June of 2009 when he re-
ceived a job offer in finance, also claims 
he never received a copy of the contract 
to keep for his records. "They gave me an-
other booklet without my signature," he 
remembers. 
"There is no way this could have hap-
pened," Cunliffe claims when I ask him 
about it. "We are part of a publicly trad-
ed company and as such, are subject to 
government audits to make sure that we 
have the proper backup for everything 
we do including the contracts that we 
sign and how they are handled." 

Cunliffe seems pained that I am at all 
suspicious of College Pro Painters. This 
is not surprising he's invested the past 
nine years of his life in the company, first 
as a Franchise Manager for three years, 
then as a General Manager for three 
years and finally as a Vice-.Presideht for 
three years. He responds defensively to 
some of my more probing questions, but 
he seems more sad than offended, as if 
I'm insulting his integrity by investigat-
ing College Pro. 

Cunliffe asks me what my take on 
College Pro is. He poses the question so 
earnestly I can't help but feel guilty for 
having my doubts about the company. 
Glossing over my apprehensions, I tell 
him that it seems like a lot of Yale stu-
dents who get involved with College Pro 
are blinded by the tale of Max Rhodes, 
thinking they can easily duplicate his 
success. 

Nodding sincerely, with his warm 
brown eyes fixed on my own, he says, 
"Max Rhodes was the worst thing that 
could've happened to Yale students." 

If Cunliffe genuinely laments the ef-
fect that Rhodes' story has had on Yale 
students, he has done nothing to curb 
Rhodes from heavily recruiting for Col-
lege Pro Painters at Yale. 

For one, Rhodes was responsible for 
pitching the Yale Daily News article that 
ran in February 2009 - the same article 
that initially piqued my own interest in 
College Pro, along with a slew of other 
would-be entrepreneurs. An editor at the 
YDN who wishes to remain anonymous 
forwarded me an email Rhodes sent to 
the Yale Daily News on February 6th, 
2009. It reads: "My friend Kim Chow 
(then an editor ·at the YDN) recom-
mended that I speak to you about a story 
idea I have for the YDN. Last summer 
I worked as a Franchise Manager for a


--- Page 23 ---

company called College Pro Painters. Ba-
sically I ran ~ $227,854 exterior painting 
btisiness in the New Haven area. This year 
College Pro is undertaking a major recruit-
ing effort on campus." 

Ever the salesman, Rhodes goes on to 
cite four reasons he feels his experience 
would make an interesting article: "Col-
lege Pro has already hired 8 Yale students 
and has plans to hire as many as 12 more. 
I painted the houses of several Yale em-
ployees, including professor Paul Bloom 
and his wife Karen Wynn. I netted around 
$60,000 in total assets ($46,286 in cash). 
I think that's a pretty attention-grabbing 
figure. It's an unusual way for a Yalie to 
spend his or her summer, but with fewer 
options this year, it's a great alternative to 
more typical internships like investment 
banking or consulting." 

A subsequent email from Arnir Shari£ 
the YDN staffer who reported the Rhodes 
piece, to the YDN editors shows that 
Rhodes was hell-bent on making the ar-
ticle as prominent as possible. 

"Max Rhodes is really intent on having 
you give his story a crash course," Sharif writes. "I mentioned that a story with a picture maybe more visible, but they don't teach you how to tratn your many of whom have never painted ett er. 


The press worked: Rhodes alleges that 
he was directly responsible for the recruit-
ment of five out of the 14 Yale students 
who signed with College Pro for the sum-
mer of 2009. 

"The College Pro administration had 
us talk to Max before we signed," explains 
Tom, Frank Piasta's friend who made close 
to $0 in profit working as a Franchise 
Manager before closing out his business 
and helping Piasta paint for a few weeks. 
"He told us all about his successes." 

What Rhodes didn't mention when re-
cruiting other students, however, was that 
he would receive $1,000 from College Pro 
if someone he referred signed a contract 
with the company. College Pro makes 
most of its revenue off of franchisees book-
ing jobs and buying proprietary materials. 
It makes sense that the company would 
want to recruit and sign as many as pos-
sible. Why franchisees would want to sign 
with College Pro in the first place is an-
other question altogether. Paging through 
the Franchise Disclosure document that 
Cunliffe sent me after our meeting, I was 
amazed by the terms that signers agree to. 

February 2010

Franchisees must independently cover 
the costs of all of their painting materials, 
find their own means of transportation to 
job sites, and personally pay their paint-
ers. They must also pay College Pro for 
"proprietary" advertising materials such 
as signs, door knockers, uniforms, payroll 
services, direct mailing postcards sent to 
potential customers' houses and telephone 
answering service. Though they vary on 
a franchise-by-franchise basis, costs for 
opening a College Pro franchise can total 
over $10,000. 

In addition, when a franchisee signs a 
contract with College Pro, he or she agrees 
to give College Pro 20% of the revenues. If 
the franchisee's business exceeds $70,000 
in revenue, the percentage of "royalty 
fees," as the contract calls them, decreases. 
Even with that concession in mind, the 
figures in the Franchisee Disclosure docu-
ment suggest that College Pro often ends 
up making more money in royalties than 
the franchisee receives in earnings after 
covering all the costs related to his or her 
business. 

Perhaps the most worrisome article 
in the document is a non-disparage-
ment clause that prohibits the franchisee 
from "at any time, directly or indirectly, 
mak[ing] any statement, oral, written or 
electronic, or perform any act or omission 
which is or could be harmful or damaging 
in any material respect to the reputation or 
goodwill of College Pro or any other per-
son or entity related to College Pro." Cit-
ing this last clause as their reason, many 
of the Yale franchisees interviewed for this 
piece refused to speak on the record or de-
clined to speak at all. 

Though the non-disparagement clause 
is lawful, it can also have alarming conse-
quences. "The clause is quite broad and 
might well prevent students from telling 
other students if they have poor experi-
ences," says Ian Ayres, the William K. 
Townsend Professor at Yale Law School 
and a Professor at Yale's School of Man-
agement who specializes in contract law. 
"It might have a chilling effect on even 
legitimate whistle-blowing as franchisees 
would worry about whether blowing the 
whistle would expose them to legal liabil-
ity for disparagement." 

On top of all this, if a franchisee terminates 
the contract he is required to pay College 
Pro "expenses incurred in retraining a re-
placement franchisee, airfare, hotel, meals, 
telephone and any other direct expense as-
sociated with the re-training of the


--- Page 24 ---

replacement franchisee; postage, delivery 
or collection costs incurred in retrieving all 
information, manuals and materials from 
Franchisee; and reasonable attorney's fees 
incurred as a result of Franchisee's termina-
tion" or $4,000, depending on whichever 
figure is greater. 

The "State Cover Page," a sheet at the 
front of the Franchise Disclosure Docu-
ment that College Pro is required to in-
clude by Connecticut State Law, is no 
more comforting. "Please consider the fol-
lowing RISK FACTORS before you buy 
this franchise," the document warns, list-
ing six factors in capital lettering. Among 
the more startling articles are: 

2. AS A COLLEGE PRO FRANCHI-
SEE, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO 
PAY CERTAIN FEES TO COLLEGE PRO 
EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO REVENUE. 

3. APPROXIMATELY 118 FRANCHI-
SEES, OR 28% OF FRANCHISEES WHO 
SIGNED FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR 2008, TERMINATED 
THE FRANCHISE BEFORE THE END 
OF THE FRANCHISE TERM. OF THE 
FRANCHISEES WHO COMPLETED 
THE FRANCHISE TERM, APPROXI-
MATELY 57% DID NOT MEET THE 
SALES TARGET WE ESTABLISHED, IN 
OUR DISCRETION, FOR FRANCHI-
SEES ... 

6. THERE MAY BE OTHER RISKS 
CONCERNING THIS FRANCHISE. 

According to Professor Ayres, the only 
benefits that College Pro is contractually 
bound to provide to its franchisees are a 
brand name and training. "There are many 
marketing schemes where the royalty of 
20o/o for· the brand name would be in the 
realm of reason," says Ayres, who is both 
a trained lawyer and economist. Take, for 
example, the Big Mac of all franchises: 
McDonald's. In addition to supplying 
its franchisees with a highly recognizable 
name and trusted products, McDonald's 
offers a rigorous training program called 
Hamburger University for all of its high-
er-level employees. College Pro Painters' 
brand recognizability and training regi-
men both fall short of McDonalds, yet 
their royalty fees exceed the chain's 12.5o/o 
royalty fees by 7.5%. Additionally, a sur-
vey sent to 21 Yale professors and admin-
istrators in various disciplines suggests that 
the name "College Pro Painters" might 
not be an advantage at all. Fourteen of the 
Yale employees surveyed asserted that they 
would not let College Pro Painters paint 
their houses. 

Many franchisees complain that the 
training provided by College Pro is also 
sub-par. Franchisees are required to attend 
a set of training sessions held in the Col-
lege Pro Painters headquarters, a converted 
industrial warehouse in Woburn, Massa-
chusetts. Cunliffe sees these four 8-hour 
classroom sessions held over weekends 
from February to June and 3-4 day paint-
ing workshop held in the field as the "big-
gest incentives that franchisees get from 
College Pro." It is during these meetings 
that the College Pro Painters staff attempts 
to teach franchisees everything there is to 
know about paint systems, paint failures, 
estimating, marketing, 'selling, interview-
ing, financial management, conflict resolu-
tion, scheduling, and logistical items franchisee's need to accomplish to properly set 
themselves up. Most of College Pro Paint-
ers' franchisees have never painted or run 
their own businesses before signing with 
College Pro, so it is up to the College Pro 
staff to educate them completely. 

Many of Yale's franchisees, however, 
complain that the training sessions did not 
do enough to prepare them for their work 
in the field. 

"There's no way you can teach someone 
everything about painting and running a 
business in a month, especially in a class-
room using power point slides," says Tyler 
Schied, another member of Yale's class of 
2009 who signed with College Pro Paint-
ers as a Franchise Manager last spring. 
Schied terminated his contract with Col-
lege Pro in April 2009, before ever paint-
ing a house, fearing that if he stuck out his 
term he would lose more money than he 
would by paying the $4,000 exit fee. "They 
give you crash courses on how to paint, 
but they don't teach you how to train your 
guys- many of whom have never painted 
either. 

Even those students who had more 
favorable experiences with College Pro 
when it came to knowing how to train 
kids who are their employees. Hyatt Bailey, a Yale student who made $10,000 working as a franchisee this past summer, remembers, "At first, production is such a mess. You barely know how to paint and then you have to train your painters when you don't really know anything yourself. All the while you have to keep your customers happy and make it seem like you know what you're doing." 

Bailey was so nervous about how un-
ready he felt for his first day of production 
that he stayed up until five in the morning 
reading articles on management strategies, 
trying to devise a game plan for how he 
was going to lead his painters. He was sup-
posed to wake up a mere hour later at six, 
but ended up sleeping until he got a call 
from his painters at nine-thirty. 

"I was like 'Oh my God!' In terms of 
leadership you don't really realize how bad 
it is until you're the boss. It's not just like 
an a capella group, or other school group 
where you're like 'sorry I'm late guys!' It's 
real life." 

Despite its manifold risks, College Pro's 
attraction is so powerful it even causes 
some Yalies to put painting before school. 
Despite his initial struggles to manage 
his painting crew, Bailey felt he gained so 
much from his experience as a franchisee 
that he is taking a leave of absence for 
the 2009-2010 academic year to work for 
College Pro. While College Pro Painters 
markets itself as a summer option, Bailey 
notes that franchisees must start marketing 
months before May if they are to book a 
solid number of jobs to produce over the 
summer. 

For College Pro franchisees, marketing 
consists mainly of "cold calling," or show-
ing up at homeowners' doors unannounced 
and inquiring whether they would like 
their house painted. New England is a 
prime area to be a painter since most of 
the houses are wood, and so require strip-
ping and repainting every five years. If left 
untouched for much longer than that, the 
wood under the peeling paint will begin to 
rot and the house might begin to leak, or 
even collapse. 

But even here, cold calling is not easy.
