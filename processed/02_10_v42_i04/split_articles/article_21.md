1he New ]ou,~nal is proud to announce that the award for Imposter of the Year goes to ... 
Jeggings! 

The New Journal explains why this new fashion trend swept the competition by a unanimous vote . 


1. First of all, the alias. Throw around the word jeggings 
a slippery elision of the words "jeans" and "leggings" 
and you'll get 
quizzical looks. Yet jeggings are everywhere among us. Jeggings, 1 point. Us, 0. 
2. Nice try, Proteus. Jeggings are the consummate shape-shifters. Got junk in the trunk? Suffering from the vitamin deficiency 
no':l5satall? Jeggings are capable of assuming any and every form. 
3. How can so little material sell itself for so much money? Designer jeggings go for $200 +, pulling off an economic scam to 
make Bernie Madoff blush 
yeah, that's why he turns red when he sees a girl in a pair of skin-tight jeggings. 
4. These tight-fitters fit in anywhere. They're as at home at home as they are at the club, as good for lounging around as for getting 
around at the lounge. Not even the skort could pull off a hat 
I mean, pant 
trick like that . 
5. Remember the good old days when a wolf in sheep's clothing was just a wolf in sheep's clothing? Jeggings escape such neat 
scientific classification. Experts still can't agree upon whether these pants are jeans dressed up as leggings or leggings dressed up as 
jeans. Indeed, it is unclear whether jeggings are pants at all. 
Congratulations, jeggings. We can pull you up. We can put you on. But we can't seem to pin you down.
