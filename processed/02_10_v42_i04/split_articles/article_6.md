BIG MEN ON CAMPUS 
Their numbers are small: emails to the 
administrative offices of the . residential 
colleges revealed only five names spread 
across two colleges, Davenport and Say-
brook. Few students in the general Yale 
College student body know of their ex-
istence. Unlike masters, deans, or profes-
sors, they do not look or behave so differ-
ently from undergraduates. Instead, they 
live among us, as us 
:Jmost. Though 
they live, eat, shower and sleep amidst un-
dergraduates, they are no longer in college 
themselves. Yes, several graduate students, 
still suspended in a dormitory lifestyle af-
ter many of their peers have moved on to 
independence and adulthood, live among 
us in the residential colleges. 

Dov Fox, YLS '10, however, seems per-
fectly content with his on-campus residen-. 
tial situation in Davenport. "I eat most, 
if not all, of my meals here," he explains, 
referring to the advisory sessions he sched-
ules with students in the college's dining 
hall to discuss summer options, career 
plans, how to develop research projects or 
get to know professors. Even if he has no 
official plans to meet with students, he sits 
with them anyway. ''I'm kind of annoying. 
I sit down and introduce myself I try to be 
a presence, so that students feel comfort-
able coming to me." 

While an undergraduate at Harvard, 
Fox interacted with the network of gradu-
ate students who live in the Upperclass 
Houses, Harvard's equivalent of Yale's 
colleges, who advise undergraduates in a 
range of different fields and academic dis-

graduate students in their dorms before, 
were playing Calhoun, and some guy on

the other team was giving me a hard time, 
college's community. Now completing his 
saying, 'Why is there some thirty-year-old 
last year of law school, Fox has been a resi-
fellow on your team?"' 

Kenneth is, in fact, nearly thirty. But 
d~nt of Davenport for the entirety of his 
graduate school career.

Rachel Schon, a graduate affiliate in Dav-
Fox, who takes his advising duties as

Fox is also the author of a book on the

admissions process and residential life at 
is three instead of four years long. Now a

program that allows for two Yale College 
may be, however, Fox is mild-mannered, 
graduates live and study at ClareCollege, 
soft-spoken and endearingly enthusiastic 
Cambridge, and two Clare students come 
about Davenport and his fellow residents.

colleges about my interest," Townsend ex-

plained, his native Mississippi accent not 
fully erased by a decade pursuing his stud-
ies in the UK and New England. 

Though Townsend has a stand-alone 
single room, he shares a bathroom with 
Saybrook undergrads. "Last Friday, Feb 
Club had parties on the first through 
fourth floors of Entryway C." Townsend 
lives on the fifth floor. "It's times like these 
that I feel like, I'm 28, I should move on," 
he says. "But the benefits definitely out:-
weigh the costs." Townsend receives free 
room and board in exchange for coordi-
nating the Mellon Forum dinners for the 
college and managing the scheduling for 
the Underbrook, Saybrook's theater facil-
ity. While room and board are no doubt 
important, Kenneth enjoys college life for 
more than its convenience and financial 
advantages. "Undergraduates are at a very . 
Schon's living experience 
could not be 
more different from· that of Fox and 
Townsend's. Her age, and the fact that un-
like the other two, she is not an affiliate 
of the college with official responsibilities, 
naturally changes her interaction with 
Davenport students. "I feel more like an 
undergraduate. The senior class is really 
friendly; they've invited me to parties," 
says Schon, who is dating a senior in Ezra 
Stiles. "I've made the conscious decision 
to see Davenport College and Slifka as my 
social community." As both a college resi-
dent and a graduate student, Rachel has 
received her fair share of blank stares. ''I'm 
constantly having to explain myself," she 
told me.

senior looking eagerly towards his di-

ploma and a life beyond the white walls 
of a crowded dormitory. But for Fox, 
Townsend and Schon, the decision to live 
in the company of students up to a decade 
their junior represe·nts less a retreat to the 
past or a fear of the future than a grown-
up decision to contribute actively and pas-
sionately to a collegiate community. Fox, 
for one, in unambiguous in his commit-
ment to Davenport: "It's definitely my 
home."
