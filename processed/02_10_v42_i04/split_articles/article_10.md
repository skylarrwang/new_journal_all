al tale of deception to another. And, of 
course, class discussion itself could be an 
interactive lesson in conning: convinc-
ing the professor that you'd done your 
homework 

But the course's academic anchor 
was Hterature. Wetter uses literary analy- . 
sis as a means . of seeing the con man 
not merely for the con, but also for the -
man. American literature in particular 
romanticizes the con man as an ideal of 
~ 
individualism, 
entrepreneurship, and 
consummate freedom: the trickster is in 
complete control of his end and identity. 
Yet in German, the word for con man 
literally translates. to "high class beggar.'' 
"" 
The con man may have you in his thrall, 
but he's fundamentally dependent: he 
needs you, desperately, to believe him. 
... 
Confidence is a precious resource, and 
the con man requires it in abundance. 
As such, being a con man is not some-
thing that every Tom, Dick, and Bernie 
is cut out for. "There are only two things 
suggests Keith Rubin '12, one of Wet-
ters' students. "The first is a man with 
absolutely p.othing to lose, and the sec-
ond is a psychopath."

In Rubin's opinion, the most sinister 
feature of the scammer is the subtleness 
of his crime. The con man's successful 
- schemes meld seamlessly into everyday 
life. The conned does not discover the 
con until it's too late. Philosophers often 
address this particularly disturbing qual-
ity of cons, arguing that a ~arried man 
who is totally oblivious to his w ife's infi-
delity is in worse straits the man signing 
divorce papers. The authenticity of our 
experiences is one of the fuJ?.d amental 
-
qualities of a good life, and cons com-
pletely undercut this authenticity. 

But perhaps the most pragmatic les-
son this class taught was what to do if you 
have the misfortune (or perhaps fortune) 
of discovering you've been conned. You 
can develop a hardened, more cynical at-
titude towards your relationships 
the 
intuitive reaction for many victims 
or 
you can choose to accept the stam with a 
' 
. 
sigh and move on. However, acceptance 
doesn't mean you've thrown up your · 
hands and resigned yourself to the con 
man's insidious ubiquity. On the con-
trary, it means you've denied the scam-
mer his ultimate moral victory: the de-
struction of the very idea of confidence. 
You've conned the con man.
