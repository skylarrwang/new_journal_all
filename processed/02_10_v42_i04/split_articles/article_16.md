In · 1997, Tonica Jenkins was arrested for 
faking a resume to gain admission to Yale's 
School of Medicine. In 2007, it was dis-
covered th_at Shin Jeong-ah, a professor at 
Korea's Dongukk University had forged 
a letter alleging that she had earned doc-
torate from Yale's Graduate School .Two 
years ago, Akash Maharaj lied about un-
dertaking a rigorous course of study and 
achieving straight N.s at Columbia to win 
a transfer into Morse's class of 2008. In all 
three cases, the repercussions for the outed 
impostors was severe: In June of 2008, 
Makharaj pleaded guilty in New Haven 
Superior Court to · having defrauded Yale 
of over $31,000 in scholarships, and was 
ordered to pay the University full res-
titution or face three years in jail. Shin 
Jeong-ah lost her job, was sentenced to 
18 months in prison and led Dongguk to 
file a $50 million lawsuit against Yale for 
mistakenly confirming the ex-professors 
inflated credentials. Jenkins, for whom a 
fake Yale application seemed to be only a 
gateway crime with biting a police of-
ficer and attempting to buy $70,000 of 
cocaine among the others 
was sentenced 
to 20 years in prison for attempted murder 
in 2003. 

'While we at 7he New journal certainly 
to do not condone such acts of criminal-
ity, we understand 
at least in some re-
spects 
the impulse behind them. Every 
year, thousands high school seniors and 
transfer applicants are barred from Yale's 
ivory tower by the crapshoot of college 
admissions. But while to most of these 
rejects go gracefully to other schools, the 
well-informed impostor follows a differ-
ent path. In the Imposter's Guide to Yale, 
Ari Berkowitz and Jacque Feldman, bona 
fide Yalies, show you how to fake it till you 
make it. 

Just don't blow their cover. 

1. If you were given the Student ID 
number of a pal with an unlimited meal 
plan, or you stole it when he was up get-
ting his third helping of tofu apple crisp, 
we offer the following advic~: Use it! Stud-
ies by impostors very much like ourselves 
have found that SID numbers can be used 
multiple times by multiple people in mul-
tiple dining halls if you wait 12 minutes 
between swipes. While attempts to use 
unlimited plans to cash in at Durfee's 
and eat in a dining halls at the same time 
have failed, the simultaneous swipe offi-
cially slides. Which means: give your un-
limited SID number out to your friends, 
they use their Durfee's swipe to get mixers, 
and then both of you use your SID to get 
lunch. Impostor: 1, Yale_: 0. 

2. The three doors on the north side of 
Berkeley's dining hall make the college es-
pecially vulnerable to access by impostors. 
Just make sure Anette is pointing to the 
Purell disp.enser before you make your en-
trance. While she looks the other way in 
the name of sanitation, you slip past in the 
name of free food.· 

3. Saybrook . is another easy target, as 
the main entrance is out of sight from the 
check-in counter. 
During peak hours, 
simply sneak inside, claim a table and then 
assure the dining hall attendant that you 
already swiped in. 

4. A tip for· any hall 
especially for 
lunch and dinner: simply offer to bring 
in the trays of those eating. outside dining 
halls in common rooms or to come in car-
rying a plate. No one will ask you to swipe 
if you're carrying already used materials. 
Cutlery is the perfect prop for a culinary 
con. Take it. Keep it. Use it when you need

5. Bring two tupperware containers 
into the dining hall and collect what cereal 
you need to stave off late-night hunger. Be 
bold. Yasha Magarik, a sophomore who 
speaks openly about his experiences pilfer-
ing cereal from dining halls says, "It's not 
a question of morals." He just gets hun:-
gry. "Confidence is a big factor," continues 
Margarik. ''I'm pretty confident when I go 
to take the cereal. I'm going to get that ce-
real. And unless they're really opposed 
to it, I end up getting it."
