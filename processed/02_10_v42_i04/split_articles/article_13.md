may expect for a school that hand picks 
its students from a pool of more than 20 
thousand nerds. 
According to the survey, some 31.5 
percent of respondents have a fake ID that 
they currently use. An added 28.5 per-
cent have had a fake ID at some point in 
their lives but either lost it, got it taken, or 
' 
turned twenty-one and no longer use one. 
Fakes are much more prevalent among 
. upperclassmen than their younger peers. 
Only 20 percent of freshmen confessed 
to having a fake ID. However, this figure 
jumped exponentially amongst sopho-
mores polled, 62o/o of whom admitted 
to ever having a fake. Numbers increased 
again among the class of 2011, 65% of 
whom had fakes. Of the seniors polled, 
85% have had fake IDs at Yale at some 
poi-nt. The trend suggests that, although 
most students do not come to Yale with a 
fake ID, many are quick to learn the ropes 
and soon hop on the bandwagon. 
And the dupes work. Over 90% of stu-
dents with fake IDs at Yale claim success 
at least most of the time, while 42°/o claim 
their fakes has never been denied in New 
Haven. 

So what kinds of IDs work? (Freshmen 
take note.) Surprisingly, these success rates 
were fairly consistent across the broad cat-
egories ofiDs that Yale students use. 1hose 
polled were asked to specify whether they 
had a real government issued ID that they 
got from someone who is now over 21, a 
falsely made ID with their own name and 
picture on it, or a falsely made ID with 
someone else's name and picture on h. As 
it turns out, falsely made dfivers' licenses 
with an individual's correct information 
are slightly more successful than those 
with someone else's information on them. 

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests 
otherwise. Two Yale freshmen who decid-
ed one night to play "Big Buck Hunter," a 
video arcade game at a certain bar/restau-
rant in downtown New Haven in which 
you shoot enormous animated deer. The 
venue requires that patrons be at least 21 
to enter, so our buck hunters needed to use 
their fakes. The first young man flashed a 
real New York drivers' license that he had " 
I please have lilY ID 
gotten from his older sister's ex-boyfriend back " the boy asked the 
who, save for the fact that he was blonde, 
looked nothing like him. But the bouncer bouncer. "I'll pay you!" 
paid no notice an~ let him in as the seco.nd 
e bo 
cer perked up." 
student handed him a falsely made Mame 
driver's license with his own name and 
picture on it. The bouncer took a good, 
long look, darting his eyes back and forth 
between the ID and an electronic palm-
pilot-sized scanner made to help bouncers 
" 
spot fakes, before he put the ID in his back 
pocket and said, "Have a good night." 
"Excuse me?" The boy asked, feigning 
to take offense as if he had no idea what 
had gone awry. · 
· · "Have a good night," the bouncer re-
peated . 

At a loss for what to do next, and hav-
ing paid $150 for that piece of plastic, he 
quickly went from tough guy 
"Hey 
man, that's my real ID, give it back!"- to, 
well... this: "Look, I don't even want. to 
drink! It's a school night and we just came 
to play Big Buck. Can I please have my 
ID back? Please?" But the sympathy ap-
peal didn't work and the bouncer paid no 
attention to him. The situation was hope . 
less, that is, until the boy desperately cried, 
''I'll pay you!" 

The bouncer perked up. He leaned in 
close to the boy and said in a loud whis-
per, "Here's the deal: I want you to turn 
around, walk out those doors, drop a 
twenty on the ground, and I'll meet you 
outside." 

The young man followed the bouncer's 
orders exactly and waited nervously for 
him outside in the New Haven cold. After 
retrieving the Jackson from the floor, the 
bouncer emerged as promised and handed 
the boy his ID back, and then said, "Just 
so you know, I knew this ID was fake be-
cause there's supposed to be a hologram 
across the bottom" (that's what the palm-
pilot must have told him). He continued, 
"Between you and me, some people fake it 
with a gold marker." 

Bouncers aren't the only ones capital-
izing on kickbacks; there's a lot of money 
in fakes. The fake ID business has become 
an extremely lucrative enterprise for those 
who have the Photoshop skills and are 
willing to assume the risks involved in 
making them. While 40 percent of Yale 
students report receiving their ID for free 
from an older friend, Yalies who had their 
ID made with their own photo on it paid 
an average of approximately $110 per ID. 

Most students with fake IDs at Yale 
have IDs that are meant to resemble U.S. 
driver's licenses, and they hail from all over 
the country. Between the 119 respondents 
who have fakes, 30 different U.S. states 
are represented, . the most common being 
California (24%), New York (15%), and 
Texas (10%). However, 12 percent of stu-
dents use fake IDs in New Haven that do 
.. 
not pretend to be from the U.S. 

One junior, who hails from England, 
had to deal with the freshman year frus-
tration of being legally allowed to drink at 
pubs back home but not at bars in the state 
of Connecticut. She did some research 
online and stumbled upon a U.K. based 
website that makes fake IDs at a bargain. 
For just twenty pounds, approximately 31 
dollars, they would mail you a fake U.K. 
identification card with your picture on 
it. Of course, until this year, there was no 
such thing as a U.K. identification card-
but bouncers in ·New Haven don't know 
that. The junior and her closest friends all 
placed an order. The fakes have never once 
failed. 

Interestingly enough, it seems that 
bouncers don't know what to do with 
themselves when someone hands them a 
foreign ID. Maybe it's because the date is 
written differently (dd/mm/yyyy vs. mm/ 
dd/yyyy), or perhaps its because ID scan-
ners don't have foreign IDs in their data-
bases; but whatever the reason, this group 
more than any other has the highest suc-
cess rate with their IDs in New Haven. 

When compared to the 91.5 percent of 
total respondents who say that their ID 
works "most of the time," 100 percent of 
those who use fake foreign IDs in New 
Haven say that it works at least "most of 
the time," and 61 percent say, "it has never 
been denied." 

So if you can get your hands on a non-
U.S. ID, that's the way to go. And you 
may be able get one for even less than 20 
pounds. One Yale sophomore from Main-
land China reports fakes on the market for 
a mere fifty cents. 

However, the cost of getting caught 
with a fake ID is not so inexpensive. Ac-
cording to Connecticut state law, th_e con-
sequences of using a fake ID to buy alco-
hol, whether it's a falsely made ID or one 
belonging to someone other than yourself, 
is a minimum fine of $200 and/or up to 


thirty days in jail. 

The market for fake IDs likely exploded 
in the wake of the 1984 National Mini-
mum Drinking Age Act that effectively 
raised the drinking age in the United 
States to 21. Prior to 1984, the drinking 
age varied state by state, but the act stipu-
lated that federal revenue be withheld from 
states that did not comply with the 21 year 
old minimum drinking age law. While 
the drinking age is still set by individual 
states, there is little room for defiance 
by individual states who needed federal 
funding to keep their highways flowing. 

However, contrary to popular belief, this 
act did not prohibit the consumption of 
alcohol outright. Only fourteen states and 
the District of Columbia specifically out-
law the consumption of alcohol by minors 
altogether, nineteen states have laws that 
are somewhat ambiguous, and seventeen 
states contain clauses that actually permit 
alcohol consumption by those under the 
age of 21 in certain circumstances. 

In Connecticut, such exceptions can be 
found couched deep in legal jargon. While 
possession of alcohol on the street will nor-
mally land you a fine upwards of $200 as a 
minor, you are in fact allowed to "possess" 
alcohol while accompanied by a parent, 
guardian, or spouse who is over 21.  

Moreover, just for having a fake driv-
ers license you could be suspended from 
operating a motor vehicle in the state of 
Connecticut for two months. 

Connecticut state law makes no dis-
tinction between IDs that are entirely fake 
and real IDs that do not belong to the 
person using it. However, not only does 
the Yale poll suggest that real IDs are less 
successful at bars and liquor stores around 
New Haven, but under federal law, assum-
ing another person's government issued ID 
is an even nwre severe crime, as it verges 
on identity theft. 

If you are arrested for underage drink-
ing, it's alway~ better to show your real ID 
than to flash a cop your fake. Not only do 
cops tend to value their egos, it is better 
to be charged with underage drinking than 
with use of a fake ID, because the former 
does not result in Jail time while the latter 
may. 

The fake ID problem is one that is by 
no means unique to New Haven; it is the 
U.S. college culture that forces these forged 
identities. While fake IDs may abound, 
the truth is that access to alcohol in college 
does not depend on whether or not you 
have a fake ID, and cracking down on the 
latter will not thwart access. One fourth 
of college students will always be of legal 
age, and the remaining three fourths will 
take advantage. So as police everywhere 
· perpetuate the ebb and flow of harsh en-
forcement, students will always discover 
new ways to find fakes and buy booze.
