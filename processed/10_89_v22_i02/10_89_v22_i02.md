The Art of Pool 
More than a recreational diversion, the game of pool has become for many students a 
romantic obsession and a metaphor for the cosmic order. The author explores this 
subculture at Yale and its power to bring together heterogeneous types. By Eric Fisher . 
Poison Pen 
After hmring Harvard's Alvin Poussaint discuss the gang rape in Central Park last

Some Pig

Writing an average of fifty pages each
semester leaves budget-conscious
Yalies with two options: swipe or
charge. 

They can
sneak out of
Connecticut Hall with
three-inch
stacks of computer paper hidden under
their jackets, or they can pay for it with
plastic at the Co-op. Both possibilities
unnecessarily deplete the North Amer-
ican environment. Wilbur's Recycled
Paper Products, a fledgling business
with a mission, now offers an alter-
native to petty ~ievery and expensive
Co-op prices.

Neal Garcia Latt (TD '89), a second-
semester senior, created Wilbur's with
two goals in mind:
to distribute
recycled paper products at affordable
prices and to educate the Yale com-
munity. To increase environmental
awareness, Latt pl~ns to insert a fact
sheet outlining the benefits of using
recycled paper in every order he receives.

If Latt sells two tons of recycled
paper-100 cartons - Yale students
will save 17 trees and enough energy to
power the average home for one year
(8,200 kwh). Using 100 cartons of
recycled paper will
also conserve
14,000 gallons of water and prevent
the emission of 120 pounds of pollu-
tants. Two tons of recycled paper
would eliminate six cubic yards of New
Haven's landfill,
relief that New
Haven and the state of Connecticut
sorely need.

Latt calls his enterprise a "business
that gives a
no-bullshit deal- an
ec?ologically sound product at a low
Prtce." He said he named his company
after Wilbur, the benevolent pig in
E.B. White's Charlotte's Web, since ~e
envisioned Wilbur's as a benevolent
business. This fall , posters (printed on
rec;ycled paper, of course) announced
Wilbur's intention to provide cheap
recycled paper.

The first shipment of recycled
products stamped with the Wilbur logo
consisted of computer paper, several
grades of xerographic and white bond
Neal Latt's Wilbur may start a new recycling trend.
paper, and envelopes. Wilbur's also
stocks some higher quality recycled
papers, such as French Linen Text and
Halopaque Offset. The best deal for
students, Latt said, is the 2,500-sheet
carton of computer paper for $35
which, split among a suite of four,
should last an entire academic year. At
the Co-op a carton this size would cost
more than $42.

To set up Wilbur's, Latt had to lo-
cate a recycled paper mill and find a
source of funds.
Latt found
a
paper company based in San Fran-
cisco that has branches on the East
Coast. He used money from Yale
Recyclers- the student group that
oversees
Yale's current recy-
cling program- to buy his first 100
cartons of paper. All the money
Wilbur makes from sales goes back
into the company.

Latt
has
approached
the
administration
directly
to boost
Wilbur's sales and Yale's committment
to recycling. To capture the office
market, he plans to attach his flyer to
the forms that offices must fill out to
order paper from Central Receiving,
Yale's paper supplier. Despite some
hesitancy on
the part of Central
Receiving, the administration has moved
toward a more extensive recychng
program. Director of Facilities Alan
Braun has approved a pilot project in
SSS Hall. Each office in the building will
have several bins for sorting trash.
Custodians will take the sorted trash
out of the building, and maintenance
workers will convey it to a recycling
dumpster. "This is the first time Yale is
getting on the ball instead of passing
the buck," Latt said.

Latt hopes he can hook up Braun
and the company he buys from, as a
first step toward converting Yale to
recycled
paper. Although Wilbur
would
not
profit
from
this
arrangement, Latt said, "Wilbur's goal
is
self-sustenance,
but ·
dissemination of recycling."

Wilbur's seems headed for financial
success anyway. Latt sold half of the
first shipment before it even arrived,
and has been receiving phone calls for
more orders constantly. Latt decen-
tralized his company to deal with
Wilbur's
popularity.
Now
each
residential college has its very own
Wilbur's representative to take orders
from students, to receive the paper
from Wilbur's truck, and to deliver to
the customers in the college. Before
graduating in December, Latt hopes to
sell recycled paper to at least four
percent of the Yale community and to
. pass Wilbur's reins to a new manager
who will expand the market.

Latt hopes that by offering inexpen-
sive paper and the convenience of free
delivery, Wilbur's will inspire the Yale
community to invest more in recycled-
paper products. On October 20,
recyclers and environmentalists
plan to rally on Beinecke Plaza to
pressure the administration to adopt a
university-wide recycling program.
State law dictates that by 1991 New
Haven must recycle 25 percent of all
solid wastes. Perhaps Latt's efforts,
reinforced with state legislation, will
lead Yale to mandate recycling. In the
meantime, however, at least Wilbur's
may keep
the thieves out of
Connecticut H all.


**Title: Yale in Japan**
**Author: Grace Glassman**

Yale in.Japan

The Imperial Court resided in Kyoto
until 1868 when Edo, or modern-day
Tokyo, became the capital of Japan.
Kyoto, with its meandering canals, old
temples
and shrines,
and cherry
blossom trees, moves at a slower pace
than cosmopolitan Tokyo. Kyoto's
streets are regular, laid out in a grid,
far less crowded than Tokyo's busy
thoroughfares. Within this setting,
lying on an old aristocratic estate, is
the Kyoto Center for Japan Studies.

This year 30 Americans, including one
Yale student, are living in Kyoto and
taking classes at the center.

When Bill Hornung (TC '91) weiu
to KCJS this semester, Yale officially
launched its first program for under-
graduate study in japan. Yale is one of
nine
universities
involved
in
KCJS,
which Stanford University
administers. The program's courses
vary from year to year, depending on
the expertise of the faculty, who are
drawn from Japanese institutions and
from the
participating American
univers1t1es.
Generally, instructors
teach Japanese language as well as
economics, history, literature, political
science and religion- which are all in
English. Japanese students sufficiently
advanced in English take classes with
the Americans. American students also
can take courses taught in Japanese at
the prestigious Kyoto University,
which is affiliated with KCJS.

Yale College will give as much as a
year of credit for study at KCJS, and
allows courses taken in Kyoto to count
both toward a student's major and
toward graduation requirements. Yale
recognizes only one other junior-year-
abroad program, Yale-in-London.
Unlike the London program, however,
letter grades earned in Kyo to do not
appear on a student's transcript.

KCJS is not yet Yale-in-Kyoto.
Nevertheless, the Kyoto program has
elminated the need for students to lug
back a year's worth of tests, essays and
notes as evidence of their studies, as
they must for all other overseas
programs outside of London.

When the Kyoto Center opened
only a year ago, Professor of Japanese
history Conrad Totman, then chair-
man of the Council on East Asian
Studies, pushed to get Yale involved in
the program. He said he wanted to
send undergraduates to a rigorous
academic institution in japan, in order
to study the country at close range.

The council's current chairman,
W 'illiam Kelly,
professor of
anthropology, explained, "We saw a
need for a program suited for japan
students with ever-increasing exper-
tise. Students going to Japan now are
better
prepared
than
their
predecessors were ten or 20 years ago.
The existing programs in Japan either
~re all but filled to capacity, or do not
meet Yale's high academic standards."

The initiation of this program
reflects the growing interest among
students in the.study of Japan and Asia
both at Yale and at other universities in
the United States. Although the major-
ity of Yale students going abroad still
travel across the Atlantic- to France,
England, Spain,
and
the Soviet
Union-the number of those heading
to Japan, China, Hong Kong and
Korea is steadily increasing. The
percentage of Yale juniors going to
Asian countries to study rose from
3
percent five
years ago to 11
percent last year, according to the
Junior Year Abroad Office. The num-
ber of those who went to Japan tripled.

Each year, Yale can send three
qualified students to Kyoto through
the new program, where they join
students from Brown, the University
of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell,
Harvard, the University of Michigan,
Princeton and Stanford.

Hornung, the only Yale student ever
to participate,
decided
to
live in the all-male Sumitomo Bank
dormitory. Other options for students
at the Center include residing with Zen
Buddhist monks,
living in an
apartment, or staying with a Japanese
family.

Totman and Kelly hope that students'
experience abroad will complement the
structure of the East Asian Studies
major and other language-intensive
majors. A year spent in the country of
their specialty is a natural culmination
to the years of language preparation
and culture study for students at Yale.

Letters
To the Editor:

A
comment on "Philosophical
Differences" (September 8, 1989). You
refer to a New York Times article
of December 29, 1987 as reflecting
" an ideological battle" among
philosophers.

In that article, I said that to frame
differences among philosophers as
analytical-vs-non-analytical was
beat a
straw
man.
(The article
misquoted me as saying "straw horse",
an interesting synthesis). My views
have therefore not "softened" as you
claim. They are now as they were
then.

Since I came to Yale in 1973, two
senior faculty have taken positions
elsewhere. One junior faculty member
who was granted tenure also left. It is
very probably the case that many other
departments have lost tenured faculty
during those sixteen years.

You failed to note that senior faculty
like myself who receive offers from
"prestigious institutions"
may
also
decline such offers and stay at Yale. In
acad me as elsewhere
there
considerable demand and conse-
quently considerable mobility.

Vincent Van Gogh's Night Cafe
The Art of Pool

It is just past midnight and I have four more books of The Republic to read. My roommate, who is on the first page of a five-page paper due tomorrow, slowly turns his head from the monitor and looks over at the pool cue he bought last week. Its two unscrewed segments rest in a corner of the common room. I look over at Blake, and our eyes meet in an admission of defeat. Blake moves with a steady determination towards the corner of the room, raises both parts of the cue, and screws them together. The next thing I know, Blake is circling the table looking for a shot. He pauses and bends over until his eyes are level with the table. With his left hand, he forms a bridge and with his right hand pulls the cue back. In a locked pool room in the basement of Saybrook College, I am finally at peace.


Torn between the demands of my classes and the lure of the pool table in the Saybrook basement, I take some comfort in knowing that I am not alone in my billiard angst. No matter what time of day or night, there is always a wait for the college tables. In fact, pool at Yale has become so popular that one shark has made a proposal to the college athletic secretaries to make it an intramural sport.


I first realized the significance of pool one memorable night last year. I had put aside a little free time and so psyched myself up to play. As my key turned in the pool room door, I heard "Love on the Rocks" drifting out of a radio on the other side. By the time I was inside the pool room, I realized that there was someone I didn't know listening to a Neil Diamond cassette, scanning the table for a shot, and singing along with Diamond-esque scruffiness. "First they say they want you, then they say ... Hey, do you want to play?" he asked.


Under any other circumstances, I would have politely (or perhaps impolitely) excused myself and escaped as fast as I could. But seeing the cue in his hand and the balls on the table, I realized that we shared a passion. We played for about an hour. The green felt of the pool table had been our common ground. After this encounter, I knew this game was powerful stuff.


All of the colleges at Yale, except Trumbull, have one or two pool tables. The tables are either in the college basements, or at least in rooms that have the atmosphere of a dungeon. Saybrook's room is a case in point. I've heard one player refer to the set-up there as a "God-awful table, in a God-awful room." The felt on the table is rubbed off so that the layer of slate underneath has shown through. The bumpers are warped and some of the balls are chipped. The carpet under the table is as rubbed down as the felt. Several cockroaches have made this orange carpet their final resting place. The underground room always seems cold and damp, and the small windows don't let in any natural light.


While the majority of pool rooms on campus look and feel like Saybrook's, there are notable exceptions. Jonathan Edwards' pool room reflects· the trend toward yuppification epitomized by upscale pool clubs like "Society Billiards" on 21st Street in Manhattan. "Society Billiards" charges twelve bucks for an hour of pool in a well-lit room lined with murals and mirrors, while upstairs, in a neon dance club called "Cafe Society," investment bankers flirt over expensive Italian dishes. In JE there are no gin and tonics nor does the Buttery rival "Cafe Society." Nonetheless, its electric blue walls and reggae music give the JE pool room a veneer of hipness and newness. Say goodbye to any hint of green swinging billiard lamps and wood grain paneling if you want to play atJE.


Supposedly, the most "authentic" (see my discussion of pool and the sleaze factor) place to play on campus is the GPCSY. The GPCSY has two tables set up in its smoky back room. Tradition dictates that the loser of each game has to pay fifty cents to stay on the table. Allegedly, some old guy even guards the GPSCY tables scouting out hustlers and warning the regulars.


At the start of each game, one player takes striped balls and solid balls of many colors and in a symbolic gesture molds them into an equilateral triangle. This is called "racking 'em up." Like the rack that shapes the balls into an ideal geometric shape, a game of pool brings together all sorts of people. Yale's diverse pool rooms provide a place where Lit majors clad in black can commune with their Group IV brothers and sisters, who are otherwise tucked away in labs atop "the hill."


In a sense, playing pool is a metaphor for the benificence of the natural order. A good game of pool can put people in touch with the workings of the world around them. It counteracts the feeling of detachment that often results from unrelenting academic pursuits. The 18th-century British philosopher David Hume seemed to lose sight of reality in his obsessive search for an a priori justification for causation. Note his thoughts on pool:


When I see, for instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause? May not both these balls remain at absolute rest? May not the first ball return in a straight line, or leap off from the second in any line or direction? All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable.


When I first encountered Hume's ideas last year, I was frightened. I was sitting in a lecture hall and there was no pool table handy to test the veracity of this passage. The world began to dissolve into chaos. I imagined that there was no sense in nature. I had no reason to assume that nightfall would come. If

nightfall did come, I had no reason to 
believe that the sun would rise the next 
day. After class, I begged a junior to 
let me into the basement of Branford. 
(It was the nearest college and I didn't 
have a key.) I found my way through 
the basement maze to Branford's two 
pool tables. I held my breath in 
anticipation as someone brought the 
tip of his cue to bear on the white ball. 
The ball rolled quickly towards a red 
ball at the far end of the table. When 
the white ball collided with the red ball, 
the red ball began rolling towards the 
corner pocket and sank. I thought it 
would. 


Beyond refuting philosophical skepticism, many addicts relish the science 
of pool. Dave Toker (BK '91 ), who 
advocates a multivaried approach to 
the study of pool, says, "Once you get 
past the basic particle physics and start 
contemplating topspin, backspin and 
English, pool becomes a science filled 
with unimaginably beautiful complex-
ities." Even physics text books that deal 
with lofty concepts like Conservation of 
Linear M omentum must oversimplify the 
game of pool to describe the collision of 
billiard balls. For example, the classic 
billiard ball problem begins with the 
phrase, 
"Assume 
a 
frictionless 
table ... " Toker, who has pushed for 
the intrarnuralization of pool, tells of a 
"short computer science major with a 
ponytail named Denny" who mastered 
the science of pool: 


"It was at the GPSCY one night, and 
I had just scratched. The cue ball was 
put on the close side of the table. It was 
Denny's turn. Denny made some quick 
measurements with his cue and then 
shot his ball with this obscure spin 
called 'throw' at the far bumper. The 
ball came off the bumper and returned 
all the way back across the length of the 
table. The eight-ball was sitting near 
the close bumper. On the return trip, 
the cue ball cut the eight-ball just to its 
left and sent it rolling slowly towards 
the right corner pocket. The eight-ball 
sunk. I couldn't believe my eyes. I said 
to myself, 'There is a lot more to this 
game than I know."' 


Besides the 
science of pool, the 
representations of pool in art and 
popular culture contribute to its allure. 
Images of pool usually romanticize the 
sleazy. Playing pool at Yale enables the 
academic to find the hustler embedded 
deep within him. It feels like a descent 
into depravity. 
Mike 
McGoldrick 
(SY '91 ), a Saybrook pool compatriot, 
confided to me recently that he would 
give anything to be George C. Scott's 
character in The H ustler for j ust one day. 
"I mean, when you talk about seedy," 
says McGoldrick, "you think of Scott's 
brilliant performance. Now that is 
sleaze in all its glory." I have a friend in 
Trumbull from Boca R aton, Florida 
who models 
himself after 
the 
Minnesota legend and insists that 


people call him "Boca-Fats." 


T he location of the pool tables at 
Yale, in the bowels of the residential 
colleges, reinforces the mythic quality 
of sleaze. 
The 
rooms and 
their 
grunginess evoke pool's su bversive 
tradition: cigar smoke, back rooms, 
and gambling. L_ike Edward H opper's 
portrayals of motels, diners, and city 
streets, 
the Yale · student's com-
mitment to pool is a quest for the 
noble in that which soc1ety holds in 
disrepute. 


In neglecting the pool rooms in the 
residential colleges., the administration 
has 
unwitt ing~y .;·reinforced 
pool's 
subversive aspects. The slanting tables 
with warped bumpers and tipless cues, 
set in cramped and musty spaces of the 
college basements, help students live 
out the underworld qualities of the 
game. Last year, Master Ann Ameling of 
Saybrook tried to get some control 
over this situation, by introducing a 
new policy regarding pool. She re-
moved the sole cue from the Saybrook 
pool room so that students must now 
check the cue out of her office to play. 
Her office is only open from ten until 
4:30, 
with 
long lunch 
break. 
policy greatly restricts the 
accessibility of the game and creates a 
persistent, 
subtle 
tension 
between 
residents of the college and the Master. 
But Master Ameling has underesti-
mated the true nature of pool players 
at Yale. "Don't worry about it," Blake 
said to me when I expressed alarm at 
the situation. "There are still a few 
cheap cues at the mall."

Alexander Theroux was furious. 
Two weeks 
after last spring's Cen-
tral Park rape, 
the Yale 
English 
professor watched a discussion of the 
incident on ABC-TV's "This Week 
with David Brinkley." Panelist Alvin 
Poussaint, a Harvard psychiatrist, was 
asked what could have driven the 
group of teenagers to commit such a 
heinous crime. "The key question to 
ask is why these kids were angry," 
Poussaint said, "angry enough that 
they would go out . . . and rape and 
almost kill someone." 


Theroux, who had known the victim 
from her days as a graduate student, 
sat down at his old manual typewriter 
and banged out the following letter on 
a sheet of Yale-embossed stationery:

Dear Dr, POUSPaint, 
Your description of 
the black men who ganged up to rape 
and virtually beat to death a woman 
in Central Park as "Rngry" implies 
a sort of state of mind inherited 
from the collective unconscious , 1. 
e, you know, ye~s ago Emmett Till 
was unjustly murdered in Mississippi 
and so these guys in April, 1989, 
disenfranchised , economicall;r. under-

realize·, by dragging in such 11high 
principles , " that in your, what, de-
lusion and/or overearnestnese by such 
cant you make thousands of racists 
on the spot in whites who are sick 
of such rubbish? 
Why not go on tele-

only place to beg in.

**Title: The Theroux Controversy**
**Author: Nina Morrison**

The letter has brought on a storm of 
violent emotions since it arrived in 
Poussaint's hands in May. "My first 
reaction was that· it had to be a forgery, 
that no professor from Yale would 
write that," Poussaint said. Calling its 
language "crudely racist,!' he sent 
copies of the letter to Yale English 
department Cliairman Richard 
Brodhead and President Benno 
Schmidt. 

Brodhead replied to 
Poussaint that whiie he took exception 
to Theroux's remarks, any punitive 
action against the professor would 
violate University free-speech policies. 
Dissatisfied 
with Yale's reply, 
Poussaint decided to make the matter 
public, and gave a copy of Theroux's 
letter to Boston Globe columnist Derrick 
Z. Jackson. Like Poussaint, J ackson is 
black; like Poussaint, he condemned 
Theroux's language and Yale's refusal 
to take action. And since jackson made 
the letter the focus of an August 
column, a number of issues- inclu-
ding Yale's policies relating to racism 
and free speech- have become the 
focus of heated debate. 

"One thing I hear so often is that 
racism doesn't exist anymore," said 
Elise Boddie, co-moderator of the 
Black Student Alliance at Yale. "But 
people seem to forget that racism today 
is more than seeing black people 
horsewhipped and lynched." While 
Boddie and Poussaint accept that 
Theroux wrote his letter in haste and 
~nger, they object to his character-
IZation of the rapists as "monkeys," a 
word taken to refer to blacks as 
subhuman or 
genetically 
inferior. 

"Theroux should have known better 
than to write such garbage," another 
reader wrote to the Globe this fall. 
Beyond the question of Theroux's 
language, Yale's own image was put at 
risk, some have charged, when he 
addressed his personal note on English 
department stationery; it implied that 
Theroux was speaking as a representa-
tive of the department. Theroux said 
that the Yale-embossed paper was all 
he had in his desk at the time, and any 
charges that he tried to give his words 
official weight 
with 
its 
use are 
"ludicrous." 

Brodhead reproached Theroux for 
his use of Yale stationery to express his 
personal views, but did not pursue any 
punitive measures. "You will obviously 
recognize the inappropriateness of my 
officially censoring the views (however 
repugnant) of anyone connected with 
this place," 
Brodhead wrote to 
Poussaint this June. He emphasized 
that Theroux's remarks were not 
endorsed by Yale or the department, 
but characterized the debate over 
Theroux's words as a question of free 
speech. Universities, he said, are not 
in a position to fire employees for the 
letters they 
write. "Of course 
I 
understand that students may be offen-
ded," he said, "but we still have an 
obligation of fair treatment." 

In his 18 years at Yale, Brodhead 
said, he cannot recall a single instance 
in which a professor was dismissed for 
using offensive language, and depart-
ments usually handle such complaints 
internally. "It hasn't struck anybody 
that this situation is so egregious as to 
warrant a departure from the way 
things are usually done," he said. 

Other Yale faculty and students hold 
that Theroux's letter may compromise 
his 
role as a 
professor. 
Frances 
Holloway, director of Yale's affir-
mative action office, officially supports 
the department's decision to honor 
Theroux's remaining one-year con-
tract. But in light of his letter, she said, 
"I would have reservations about his 
evaluations of black students' work." 

Boddie, 
too, 
worries that 
the 
information Theroux conveys to stu-
dents in class might contain the same 
biases she found so offensive in his 
letter. 

Von H ughes, a former student of 
Theroux's, told Jackson that, as a 
professor of writing, Theroux should 
have been particularly conscious of his 
choice of language. "Theroux told us in 
class about the force of words and how 
words convey feelings," Hughes said. 
"When he wrote that, he had to have 
known the exact impact he wanted to 
have." 

Theroux maintains that he has done 
nothing to warrant this barrage of 
criticism. He said that he wrote the 
letter in a rage, but that any racist 
interpretations are unfounded. "I have 
no problems with being considered a 
bigot because that's the last thing I 
am," he said. "Aren't English pro-
fes~ors allowed to get angry?" Cate-
gori'zing the black men who raped the 
jogger as "monkeys" may have been 
injudiciousJ he said, but he was 
attempting to d~scribe- their actions, 
not their skin color. "I never intended 
any insult to the black COJ!lmunity," he 
said. "I don't think that black people 
look like monkeys. I used that as an 
example that the rapists were anima}s, 
that their behavior was animalistic." 

Why did Theroux choose the word 
"monkeys," then, with all the historical 
connotations that word holds? "Why 
not?" responded Theroux. "I never 
really thought once of that. I could 
have said jackals." 

Theroux said that a 
few hasty 
remarks are no grounds on which to 
judge him. He cites his writings, 
novels which he said explicitly 
condemn bigotry and prejudice, as 
evidence that he is 
not racist. 

"Everyone's throwing a shit fit about 
one word," he said, "but I've got two fat 
volumes of prose to counterbalance it." 

Theroux also said that his critics 
missed the point of his letter: that a 
rape cannot be excused by attributing 
it to social anger on the part of the 
perpetrators. In making this point, 
Theroux was not alone; other viewers 
also wrote 
letters objecting 
to 
Poussaint's remarks on the Brinkley 
show. In a letter to the Globe, for 
example, Margaret Hagen, associate 
professor of psychology at Boston 
University, critic'ized Poussaint's 
analysis and Jackson's reference to the 
rape as a "mugging." "Both Poussaint 
and Jackson legitimize, and indeed 
institutionalize, 
a 
depth of sexist 
hatred so great that it virtually 
guarantees the commission of violent 
attacks against women," she wrote. 

Theroux said that Poussaint's remarks 
seemed to him an attempt to excuse the 
rape. "I thought he tried to explain it 
away, .not just explain it," Theroux 
said. "In trying to align that to a higher 
agenda, or a personal agenda, it mocks 
the near death of the. woman." 

As far as racism goes, Theroux said, 
"the point of the letter was actually 
anti-racist." In a Globe Letter to the 
Editor Theroux wrote, "By calling 
those thugs 'angry,' Poussaint falsely 
assigns them a $ociological and/or 
political agenda, suggests this mitigates 
the crime, and actually creates racists 
himself." This kind of injustice 
continues, Theroux said, when blacks 
try to portray him as a bigot. "It's very 
interesting," he said, "how racism 
always seems to be against whites." 

It is unlikely that the University will 
take disciplinary 
action 
against 
Theroux. The only clear-cut rule he 
has violated is the ban on using official 
stationery 
for 
personal 
correspon-
dence, and Brodhead has privately 
rebuked him for doing so. But Boddie 
and other students insist that Theroux 
should be punished under Yale's racial 
and ethnic harrassment regulations. 

Although he did not address his 
remarks to a 
particular student, 
Boddie said, his language and attitude 
are a significant slight to all black 
students at Yale. Poussaint agrees. 

"This is so hurtful and damaging to 
people that you have to stand up ang 
say, 'No, you can't do this,"' he said. 
"Look at the harm you may be doing, 
having students who are wary of him 
and his attitude." 

No precedent exists to show how the 
University would evaluate a grievance 
against Theroux. Professor of psycho-
logy William Kessen, who chaired the 
President's Committee on Racial and 
Ethnic Harrassment until this year, 
said that no student has ever brought a 
complaint before the eight-year-old 
committee. "Unlike most University 
committees, the rules are not codified 
in any sense," Kessen said. "But there 
has to be a complainant. Someone has 
to come forward and say, 'I have been 
injured.'" 

Theroux remains confident that his 
reputation at Yale will bear no scars 
from the recent controversy. "The 
reason I wasn't fired is not because of 
free speech, it's because the English 
department knew I'm not a racist," he 
said. 

Theroux's second one-year contract 
is up for renewal in April, and 
Brodhead declined to comment on the 
effect that Theroux's letter will have on 
his reappointment. "We'll consider 
everything that's pertinent," he said. 

Holloway said she is satisfied with the 
administration's actions, 
since 
visiting professor's misstatements are 
much less damaging to the University's 
image than a 
tenured professsor's 
would have been. 

At BSAY's first meeting this semester, 
the group discussed taking action 
against Theroux, but has not decided 
whether it will formally petition the 
Committee on Racial and Ethnic 
Harrassment. Although Boddie wants 
to see Theroux fired, she does not 
think it will happen. "I've had enough 
dealings with this administration to 
know 
that 
isn't on Benno 
Schmidt's agenda," she said. For now, 
Boddie said that BSA Y's goal will be to 
publicize Theroux's letter. "If 
professors 
they'll 
be held · 
accountable, that will at least make 
them more careful of what they write 
or say in the future," she said. 

Theroux is as eager to clear his 
name of any charges of racism as 
BSA Y is to pursue them. He said that 
many of his detractors have deli-
berately misrepresented his comments, 
while others have misunderstood 
them. 

As 
famous 
psychiatrist, 
Poussaint is motivated by his own 
wounded pride, Theroux said, not by 
the content of the letter. "He's not used 
to anything but deference and slipper-
kissing," Theroux wrote in a letter to 
the managing editor of the Globe. 

Theroux has threatened Boddie with 
a libel suit if she or BSA Y make any 
public "false suggestions" about his 
letter. He also warned the Globe this 
summer that Jackson's column might 
soon bring them to court, although 
Globe lawyers have said that Theroux's 
case against them is weak. Theroux 
has told the Globe that he may produce 
even more written words on the topic, 
possibly a response in the Boston Herald 
to Jackson's Globe column. Unlike 
some of his summer correspondences, 
Theroux said, the Herald piece is one 
he "would 
positively 
relish 
writing."

**Title: God and Politics The Two Faces of the Yale Divinity School**
**Author: Motoko Rich**
**Page number(s): 16-17**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Along the corridors of the Yale 
Divinity School Chapel, rows of class 
pictures link one year of graduates to 
the next. Gary Hartpence, Class of 
1961 , appears in a small black and 
white photograph, an inconspicuous 
face among many. When the young 
Hartpence posed for that picture, he 
had no idea that he would gain renown 
as Gary Hart, Democratic senator 
from Colorado and candidate for 
President of the United States. YDS's 
idyllic campus appears an unlikely 
place for political action. In the quiet 
chapel, the intensity of politics seems 
far away. But throughout the Divinity 
School's history, the distinction 
between church and state has blurred, 
and today, politics still intertwines with 
the religious identity of the school. 


Primarily a Christian institution, 
the Divinity School trains women and 
men for the ministry. While approx-
imately 50 percent of its graduates go 
on to receive ordination, a small 
percentage views YDS as a stepping 
stone to political life. In addition to 
Hart, Republican Senator John C. 
Danforth graduated from YDS in 
1963, and Walter Fauntroy, Demo-
cratic congressman from the District of 
Columbia, earned his degree in 1958. 
YDS Professor Emeritus William Muehl 
served three terms as an alderman in 
the 18th Ward of New Haven from 
1963 to 1969, and Michael Morand, 
Democratic nominee for the position of 
First Ward alderman, began his first 
year at YDS this fall. 


The conjunction of churchly and 
civic duties is nothing new at Yale. 
Puritan ministers founded Yale Col-
lege in 1701 , stating in "An Act for 
Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" 
that 
they wanted an institution 
"wherein Youth may be instructed in 
the Arts and Sciences who through the 
blessing of Almighty God may be fitted 
for Publick employment in Church 
and Civil State." While Yale College 
has ceased to train students for the 
ministry, YDS continues Yale's earliest 
tradition. 


the YDS campus might surprise out-
siders. During the Presidential cam-
paign of 1988, joggers from Yale 
College saw posters for Pat Roberston 
plastered to dormitory doors and 
windows as they trotted through the 
Divinity School courtyard. The posters 
seemed to indicate a strong conser-
vative element on campus. But in fact, 
only one student ran the Robertson 
campaign, 
and he gathered little 
support from his classmates. Most 
YDS students described the campus as 
predominantly Democratic in the 1988 
election. Rusty Green, a third-year 
student who voted for Bush, recalls 
sermons led by his peers during the 
campaign. "It wasn't stated, but they 
were implying that the Christian thing 
to do was vote for Dukakis," Green 
said. 


The Divinity School can look back 
on a past more pointedly activist than 
the present. Danforth, in a lecture he 
gave at YDS three years ago, recalled 
his days as a student at the Divinity 
School in the early 1960s: 


With the recent associations between 
religion and Reagan-era conservatism, 
and with fundamentalist ministers like 
Jerry Falwell afoot, the liberalism of 
It was the heyday of the Civil Rights 
movement. One of the major con-
cerns of the time was segregation of 
Woolworth lunch counters in the 
South ... Seeking to bear witness to 
our faith, a number of us piled into a 
station wagon, with signs in the 
baggage area and made for the 
Woolworth store on State Street. I 
have a sharp memory of picketing 
the store with our chant "1, 2, 3, 4, 
don't go in the Woolworth store; 5, 
6, 
7, 
8, southern · Woolworths 
segregate." 


University Chaplain Harry Adams, 
Master of Trumbull College, recalls a 
YDS-organized procession to the New 
Haven Green in support of a black 
student who was denied admission to 
Vanderbilt University. Hart remem-
bers students traveling to Mississippi 
and Alabama during their summer 
vacations to help with voter regis-
tration. According to Adams, during 
the Vietnam War, Divinity School 
students were among those who turned 
in draft cards and marched in 
Washington. 


Today, the mood on campus is 
calmer, and students have turned from 
marches and protests to social service. 
Volunteers work for various organi-
zations: ·soup kitchens, 
Dixwell 
House, 
local 
hospitals , 
battered 
women's shelters, Planned Parent-
hood, and the Quinnipiac Housing 
Project. In a sense, the educational 
purpose of the school - training for the 
ministry- constitutes a call to com-
munity service. "People go into the 
ministry because they are interested in 
serving," said Letty Russell, professor 
of liberation theology. 


This interest in serving can extend 
beyond the confines of the church. 
'"The ministry is concerned with how 
the Christian commitment is lived out 
in the community of the world, and is 
acted out in the social and political 
arena," said Adams. 


Hart agrees. He follows the tradition 
begun by John Wesley, the 18th-
century British founder of Methodism, 
who focused on serving the needs of 
the "have-nots" in society. "Wesley 
didn't say join the Democratic Party or 
run for office, but he did say meet the 
needs of people on earth, and I was 
greatly influenced by that," said Hart. 


The Divinity School incorporates 
this commitment to social service into 
the curriculum through the "Super-
vised Ministry" requirement for the 
Master of Divinity degree. Students 
fulfill this requirement by working in a 
parish church or social service agency. 
Although more and more students are 
seeking placement in churches, only 
two years ago the high demand for 
positions in social service agencies 
made it difficult to meet all the 
requests. John Geter, President of the 
YDS student body, thinks the rising 
interest in church work indicates a new 
conservatism on campus. But Field 
Placement Coordinator Bernadette de 
Giulian insists that it is too soon to tell. 


Other areas of the YDS curriculum 
also embrace the social service ethic. 
Russell's courses in liberation theo-
logy emphasize a commitment to the 
church within the political world. In 
her advanced course, students read 
texts from a particular country and 
then spend some time in that country 
at the beginning of the spring se-
mester. Last year the class traveled to 
Mexico, and this year, Russell plans to 
take her students to South Africa. 


Since her courses are not required, 
students may make a political move 
simply by enrolling. "People think 
you're 
radical for taking liberation 
theology," Russell said. 
"People stand 
against the climate of the school in 
order to take my courses." 


Russell's courses are among a few 
that address issues outside of academic 
theology. 
Sister Shawn Copeland 
teaches a course on African-American 
theology, and Sister Margaret Farley 
teaches Ethics. "They really encourage 
students to integrate their studies with 
what is actually happening in New 
Haven and the rest of the world," said 
Ann Lutterman, a third-year student. 
"But many students say, 'Oh well, I've 
got to be ordained, and I don't have 
time to take frivolous courses like 
Liberation Theology.'" She added that 
faculty advisors have discouraged 
students from taking these courses, 
counseling that such a program would 
look bad on the students' records when 
applying for church jobs. 


Lutterman believes that such atti-


**Page number(s): 17-18**

tudes 
reflect 
the current political 
climate at YDS, which she finds more 
apathetic than activist. "It's pseudo-
liberal, but not doing much," said 
Lutterman. For her, liberalism on 
campus means a tolerance of many 
ideas, not an active progressive force. 


"Sometimes it's like pulling teeth just to 
get people to do certain things," 
Lutterman said. While some students 
and faculty cite Central America as a 
concern in the YDS community, 
Lutterman is the only active worker 
from YDS in the New Haven chapter 
of Citizens in Solidarity with the 
People of El Salvador. 


The most vigorously debated poli-
tical issues on campus directly concern 
students' experience at the school. "The 
Divinity School is to some extent a city 
set on a hill," said Morand. While the 
hill may isolate students from external 
concerns, it also encourages them to 
turn inward, Daily sermons reveal that 
theology and politics are intimately 
connected, through what students refer 
to as "inclusive language." Students 
and faculty try to recognize and eli-
minate gender or racial prejudices in 
the religious language of the Bible and 
in their sermons. Using inclusive 
language means not referring to God 
as "He", changing 
references of 
"mankind" 
to "humankind", and 
increasing sensitivity to "racial 
overtones when invoking images of 
light and dark. "I think it really goes to 
the heart of life in the community," 
said Morand. "It's one of the ways in 
the school that political or social issues 
are being expressed, because it's some-
thing that affects everybody, and people 
are struggling through worship." 


Since inclusive language entails 
changing words in the Scriptures, 
some students resist it in the name of 
the sanctity of the Biblical word. "I 
would be against rewriting the Bible," 
said Green. 


Students face the issue of inclusive 
language in Chapel services every day, 
and no one on campus can avoid being 
exposed to it. "Inclusive language is the 
most visible thing, because there is a 
constant reminder as to whether people 
are using it or not," said Russell. A 
new crop of students encounter the 
concept every year. "I never experi-
enced an inclusive language worship 
service until I got here," said Susie 
Post, a second-year YDS student. 


The faculty and staff at YDS issued 
a 
statement encouraging but not 
mandating the use of inclusive lan-
guage in the mid-'70s. The statement, 
while symbolic, did little to 
resolve the issue; those who had been 
using inclusive language continued to 
do so, while those who opposed it did 
not start. "It pretty much established 
the lines where they were already 
drawn," said Geter. 


In students' careers, the discussion 
of inclusive language may ultimately 
prove moot. Many parishes do not 
accept such language in their sermons 
and some students on supervised mini-
stry assignments have been criticized 
for using it. Although Post, after two 
years at YDS, now advocates the use of 
inclusive language, -she plans to enter 
the Episcopal Church ministry, which 
does 
not 
allow the language of 
inclusion in its sermons. 


While inclusive language constantly 
receives attention on campus, some 
students dismiss it as trivial. Still, those 
who feel excluded by standard ecclesi-
astical terms care deeply about the 
issue. "We recognize it's not trivial 
because of the power of language to 
determine 
social structures," said 
Sandy Sorensen, a third-year student 
at YDS. For many of the 165 women 
in the YDS student body, the social 
structure of the church is of particular 
concern. "I think that whether every-
one recognizes it or not, there's still a 
lot of resistance to women in the 
church," said Sorensen. 


Some churches still do not ordain 
women as ministers. Michelle Bashi, a 
second-year student and co-coor-
dinator of the YDS Women's Center, 
is a Roman Catholic, and as a woman, 
cannot serve as a priest. Bashi does not 
want to challenge this aspect of the 
church structure. "Most Roman 
Catholic women feel it's not a battle 
worth putting our energy into because 
we don't feel we would have an 
impact," she said. In denominations 
which do ordain women, worries re-
main about how women are accepted 
in the parishes. "Even if ordination per 
se isn't an issue, there is still a lot of

concern about authority and how 
women can work in the church," said 
Sorensen. 

The YDS Women's Center stands 
out as a vigorous campus force. In 
discussions and forums, the center tries 
to expose students to issues of justice 
for women. Inclusive language is, of 
course, a paramount issue, and the 
Women's Center sponsored a forum on 
the subject October 6 and 7. Last year, 
the center ran an educational cam-
paign on sexual violence 
against 
women, and this year Bashi plans to 
initiate 
discussion of reproductive 
rights. "These are issues that the 
church hasn't done justice to," said 
Bashi. "I'm concerned to raise the issue 
in such- a way that productive dis-
cussion happens, but I'm not sure if 
that's possible," she said. 

Bashi's 
fears of. unproductive 
discussion may stem from the spec-
trum of attitudes toward women on 
campus. "There ar~ people who take 
very seriously the feminist perspec-
tive," said Sorensen. "But I think 
there's also a prett~ strong counter-
attitude that 
takes 
the 
form of 
trivializing the concerns of women." 

Discussion may prove difficult because 
students are wary of expressing strong 
opinions. "I think there's a fairly large 
group of people who just don't see it as 
an issue either way and are fearful of 
controversy and strong feeling on 
either side," said Sorensen. 

Early in September, the Women's 
Center organized a sermon in which 
the women leading the service asked 
for prayers in support of justice and 
equality for women. After the service, 
three men approached Scott 
Williamson, a second-year student and 
chairman of the Social Action Com-
mittee, 
and complained 
that 
service was too political; its goal was no 
longer prayerful, they said. "They 
will recognize the political agenda 
whenever it moves to change the 
existing political status quo," said 
Geter. Greer thinks there are other 
forums more productive for mobili-
zing people to action than a sermon. 
"The preacher has a captive audi-
ence. If the audience 
feels 
like 
~t's being 
sold 
a 
bill of goods 
•t gets turned off," he said.

Two summers ago, a group of skin-
head subletters trashed a building on 
Edgewood Avenue. The narrow, two-story structure stood vacant and gutted 
for 
a 
year, with boards covering 
the windows and weeds growing up 
around the porch. Yale students who 
live off campuS- now call the building 
the "crack house," and rumors abound 
about the illicit activities that went on 
inside. The tale of the "sublet from 
hell" has become a classic among 
stories about apartment disasters. But 
what most students don't know is that 
the building, which is finally being 
renovated this fall, belongs to Yale. 
The house on Edgewood is one of 
many Yale-owned buildings which do 
not appear on the University map in 
the 
Yale 
College . Programs 
of Study 
handbook. The .houses Yale owns on 
the east side of Mansfield Street, a 
quiet, tree-lined residential area, do 
not appear on that map either; neither 
do two newly rehabilitated brick apart-
ment buildings on Dixwell A venue. 


The University rents out more than 
570 apartments in nearby neighbor-
hoods, as well as the buildings used by 
various local businesses. 
Kinko's 
Copies and Phil's 
Hairstyles on 
Broadway, Naples R estaurant, the 
Daily Cam;, and Chapel Wines and 
Liquors are all Yale tenants. 
The infamous sublet is a rare case, 
the result of a student lessee's unusual 
choice of summer renters. Most people 
who live in Yale-owned houses are 
graduate students and faculty. But 
Yale's property extends far beyond the 
fortress-like heart of campus, to areas 
outside those which most students 
associate with the University. Yale 
holds the title to more land than 
anyone else in New Haven- 13 per-
cent of the city overall. This fact has 
brought the University into conflict 
with a variety of neighbors. 
"There's an old joke about Grove 
Street Cemetery," 
said 
Michael 
Morand, Democratic candidate for 
alderman in the Fir$t Ward, "that the 
dead shall be raised + when Yale wants 
the land." Tension over Yale's expan-
sion, and the use of its untaxed pro-
peny, tends to mount at times when 
the U niversity is making major new 
acquisition. Citizens, politicians, and 
administrators argue passionately over 
the issues that Yale's enormous 
property holdings bring up, including 
their tax-free status, their effect on the 
housing market in a city with hundreds 
of homeless people, and how Yale 
should invest in the city. 

Recently, the battle raged between 
residents of the HilJ neighborhood and 
university administrators over the 
Yale Psychiatric Institute. YPI, an 
inpatient hospital for emotionaUy dis· 
turbed young people, will move into a 
new building next month, next to 
Yale/New H aven Hospital in the Hill. 
University 
Secretary 
S h e il a 
Wellington called the YPI project "an 
excellent example of Yale colJaborating 
with the city." Alderwoman R obie 
Pooley, the R epublican mayoral can-
didate, called it "a disgrace." The 
negotiations over YPI exemplify the 
conflicts between New Haven and an 
expanding Yale.

Yale administrators said that YPI 
will benefit the community in ways not

law. WelJington suggested that YPI's 
research on mental illness 
might

illness, and its severity, are worse as

said. Paul Haeberle, executive director 
of YPI, pointed out that a separate 
branch of the institute, the Commu-
nity Service Division, already provides 
care for the poor. The branch runs 
programs including an 
outpatient 
hospital and vocational training, and 
helps patients find apartments.

In addition, YPI promised to build

building is to make it as non-insti· 
tutional as possible but also to be 
responsible to the neighborhood," said 
Lawrence Berger, YPI's deputy direc· 
tor of administration. More impor· 
tantly for city officials, the storefront 
means that part of the building will be 
taxed. 

YPI's move to the H ill caused an 
uproar because both the human and 
financial interests of New Haven are 
closely tied to the city's land. While 
citizens are 
concerned that Yale 
address the needs of their neighbor-
hoods when it moves in, city officials 
worry about losing property taxes as 
the University expands. 

Attaching a store to YPI is only a 
smaJI victory in New H aven's struggle 
to recapture some of its shrinking tax 
base. The city is riddled with nan· 
taxable land, including universities, 
churches, 
cemeteries , 
hospitals, 
schools, 
and 
municipal property. 
Altogether, almost a third of New 
Haven's assessed property value goes 
untaxed. Yale holds 38 percent of that 
land, far more than anyone else.

an aide in the city's Fair Rent office, Yale avoids the public process of seeking zoning changes. In cases of major projects like YPI, because it doesn't want to raise citizens' hackles. "Half the city shows up for those hearings," he said, "people carrying signs saying 'Tax Yale' and 'Make Yale Pay,' and Yale doesn't like that kind of P.R."

The city seized its chance to stop Yale's expansion when, in 1965, the University tried to build a 13th residential college on the corner of Grove Street and Whitney Avenue. The University owned the land, but needed a variance to build a dormitory there. The Board of Aldermen thwarted Yale's plans by passing an ordinance saying Yale must seek the Board's permission for a variance. Yale challenged the ordinance in court, and the judge declared it unconstitutionaL By that time the University had abandoned the project. Ironically, 24 y.ears later, several alderpeople are angry at Yale for not providing more on-campus student housing. "It doesn't matter what they build or where they build, but they should build something," said Alderman Dick Lyons, of Ward 10. "Yale just doesn't address this problem at all." Although city officials object to the idea of Yale buying up land and taking it off the tax rolls, many also say that students in the New Haven housing market make a tough situation worse.

Yale administrators see the situation differently.. "If the University were miraculously able to provide on-campus housing for all of its students, a) we can't make people live in them, and b) an enormous amount of income that is going into the New Haven economy now wouldn't be there anymore," said Yale's Assistant Secretary Susan GodshalL Administrators point out that the University has made loans to organizations working to alleviate the housing crunch, and that Yale has considered investments in community housing projects. Last spring, Yale made a low-interest $1 million loan to Housing Operation Management Enterprise (HOME, Inc.), a nonprofit organization, to fund its affordable housing project. "There is no question that Yale is a powerful entity in this town, and as such has moral and ethical responsibilities to help the community," said Bob Solomon of HOME, Inc. He called the $1 million loan "a good start towards meeting those responsibilities." But not everyone shares Solomon's optimism. "The $1 million loan to HOME, Inc. was just barely below market lending rates, and Yale needs to be doing much more than that," said Reverend Carl Hilgert, an advocate for the homeless. Two years ago; President Benno Schmidt announced the New Haven Initiative, a commitment to invest $50 million in New Haven over the next ten years. The ~niversity invested the first $2 million of the initiative funds this year in Ninth Square Redevelopment, a project in a three-block section downtown. Joel Schiavone, a major New Haven developer and gubernatorial candidate, is still dissatisfied. "Yale has been conspicuously absent on any projects," he said. "They haven't even committed the interest on the $50 million." But counting the dollars invested in New Haven is an unfair way of assessing the University's service to the city, according to administrators. "There are many ways that Yale contributes to the New Haven area-obvious things like payroll and purchasing power, and participation on city boards and commissions," said GodshalL 

Furthermore, the University is looking after its internal interests. When considering investments, Yale's primary concern is to protect and to increase its $2.5 billion endowment. "It's not just a question of social policy," Godshall said. "We have to find investments that meet the standards of the overall investment project, but which happen to be in New Haven."

For four days at the beginning of the 
term, Matthew Weed (SM '93) argued 
with the Yale College Dean's Office 
about where he should cross the street. 
Weed, 
who 
is 
Yale's 
first 
blind 
undergraduate in ten years, said he 
had trouble navigating the diagonal 
crosswalk at the intersection of Grove 
and College without wandering out 
into traffic. Instead, he wanted to cross 
Grove Street near the unmarked inter-
section at Hillhouse Avenue. But Dean 
William DiCanzio of Silliman insisted 
that he use the diagonal crosswalk, 
which is near a traffic light, or else take 
a guide with him. Weed said he 
wanted to cross by himself. 
When neither the dean nor Weed 
would give in, DiCanzio took the 
matter to Betty Trachtenberg, dean of 
freshman affairs. Trachtenberg also 
insisted that Weed cross at the light. 
Finally, Chris Foy, a mobility instructor 
with the Connecticut Board of Education 
and Services for the Blind, intervened and 
convinced the deans to let Weed cross by 
himself at the Hillhouse intersection.

students with disabilities who rely on 
services from Yale. Recently, many of 
these students have become increas-
ingly vocal about what they see as the 
University's failure 
to meet their 
needs. "I wasn't surprised that the 
University was unready," Weed said, 
"but it's frustrating that they're as 
unready as they are." Last December, 
Equal Access for Students at Yale 
(EASY), a group of disabled students, 
sent a letter to Deputy Provost Charles 
Long enumerating their complaints. 
The group claimed that bureaucratic 
inefficiency, inadequate resources, and 
poor accessibility to buildings inter-
fered with their education. "It is hard 
to know where to begin to answer your 
many concerns and suggestions," Long 
wrote back. "However, I want you to 
know 
that 
the administration 
emphatically committed to finding a 
solution to them." 
Since 1980, Yale has been de-
veloping programs to meet the needs of 
disabled students. But as students with 
a variety of different disabilities enter 
the University, administrators, deans, 
professors and counselors have dealt 
with 
each 
individual 
differently, 
forming policy as they go along. 
Under a 1978 federal law-Section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act- insti-
tutions which receive federal funds 
must "operate their federally assisted

programs or activities so that when 
viewed in their entirety they are 
readily accessible to handicapped 
persons." Yal~ formed the Advisory 
Committee on Disabilities in response 
to the law in 1980. Since it first met,


the committee has mainly concerned 
itself with 
installing ramps 
and 
removing barriers so that mobility-
impaired students can move around 
the campus more easily. Each year the 
committee recommends improvements 
to make the University more acces-
sible, such as installing elevators at 
Cross Campus Library and the Yale 
Repertory Theater. 
David Heaton, a fifth-year graduate 
student in sociology and a member of 
EASY, lobbied for two years to get a 
ramp built at the statistics lab on 
Prospect Street. One year, 
the 
University put in a .temporary ramp, 
but Heaton decided it was 
too 
dangerous. The 
s~cond year, the 
Buildings and Gr<il;mds Committee 
rejected plans because it deemed them 
ugly. 
While fellow graduate 
students collaborated with advisors in 
the new lab, Heaton, who uses a 
wheelchair, had to do his lab work 
alone on a computer in his room. 
"Usually projects are finished after 
the students involved will be gone," 
said Richard Savage, chairman of the 
Advisory Committee. Yale's Gothic 
architecture, with its many gates and 
staircases, coupled with the enormous 
cost of renovation, slows down the 
committee's progres!!. A single per-
manent ramp can cost up to $50,000 to 
install. Since the committee's annual 
budget is $100,000, the University 
asks 
individual departments 
graduate schools to fund some pro-
jects. 
But departments also 
feel 
bu<;jgetary constraints, and the plans 
get delayed. In 1986, the committee 
proposed installing a ramp at the 
Divinity School, when a student in a 
wheelchair enrolled. The ramp was not 
constructed until the student's last 
semester. "We did a detailed plan for -
the Divinity School ramp," said Wint 
Cannon, senior architect for Archi-
tectural and Engineering Services, 
"but no one could decide who should 
pay for it." 
Since there are so few students who 
need modifications like ramps (five 
wheelchair users currently attend 
Yale), and because of the problems of 
time and expense, administrators try 
to find more expedient ways to acco-
modate these students. Before the start of 
each term, Associate Registrar David Mills 
contacts mobility-impaired undergraduates 
to make sure they can get to all the classes 
they are considering taking. "I start talking 
to them a month before school begins, and 
we discuss what they are going to shop. 
We make up a bunch of scenarios- if they 
take this class, we'll put it in this building," 
he said. 
Although the Univer.slty makes sure 
that students in wheelchairs can take 
the classes they want, these students 
cannot participate in many non-
academic activities held in inaccessible 
buildings. Shortly after he arrived, 
Heaton proposed that the University 
make the bar at the Graduate and 
Professional Student Center at Yale 
(GPSCY) accessible, but after three 
years of planning, the cost of a ramp 
has increased to $100,000. The Uni-
versity has yet to move forward on the 
project. 
Another member of EASY, Jo 
Brooks (BK '90), called University 
Career Services to see whether she 
could use the resource library there. 
"They said, 'Well, it kind of, it really, it 
depends on you, and what you're wil-
ling to do.' They meant, am I willing to 
let someone carry me up and down the 
stairs into the building? Now that's a 
precarious position for Yale to put 
itself in-one, it's humiliating and two, 
you don't want to be hurt." Dean 
Susan Hauser, director of UCS, said 
she wants to move the resource library 
to an accessible room in the UCS 
building. But the room is specifically

designed to house the University's 
multi-media language 
lab. 

Yale 
committees have been deliberating 
over the problem for two years. Plans 
to build a ramp to UCS also have yet 
to emerge from the Advisory Commit-
tee. "It's hard," H auser said. "There 
are handicapped recruiters who I have 
to tell not to come." 

Other inaccessible buildings on 
campus include the post office, the 
Affirmative Action Office, Sprague 
Hall and all of the cultural centers. 
"Nearly every place where student 
services are performed is inaccessible," 
said Savage, who uses a wheelchair 
himself. "It just makes life awkward 
and difficult." As chairman qf ·the 
Advisory Committee, Savage said that 
making academic buildings accessible 
must take priority over helping stu-
dents participate in extracurricular 
activities. 

Granting access to buildings is only 
. one way in which the University must 
accomodate disabled students under 
the law. In 1985, the University 
opened the Resource Office for Stu-
dents and Employees with Disabilities, 
which currently serves about 50 
members of the Yale community. The 
office finds guides and readers for the 
visually disabled, scribes for students 
who cannot write, and sign-language 
interpreters for the hearing-impaired. 
The office also provides a range of 
equipment, including tape recorders, 
auditory assistors, a Braille typewriter 
and printer, 
and 
a 
Kurzweiler 
Reading Machine-a computer that 
scans text and reads it aloud. 

Since the Resource Office opened, 
two of its managers have resigned, and 
students and administrators have 
argued about how the office should 
function. The first person to manage 
the Resource Office was Rosette 
Liberman, a Ph.D. candidate from the 
University of Bridgeport. Her work as 
assistant director became the basis for 
her doctoral dissertation entitled 
"The Management of Post-secondary 
Institutions in Compliance with Sec-
tion 504." Liberman wrote her own job 
description, assigning herself "signi-
ficant latitude for the exercise of 
independent judgement." She started a 
number of projects, which included 
establishing contact with the New 
Haven branch of Readings for the Blind, 
developing 
pool of student 
volunteers to serve as readers and 
guides, and making numerous recom-
mendations to the Yale administration 
about improving disabled students' 
access to University resources. 

During her three-year tenure, 
Liberman proposed a 
policy that 
required that all student organizations 
hold their meetings 
in accessible 
buildings or move them on demand. 
Deputy Provost Long rejected. the 
proposal, contending that forcing all 
the organizations on campus to move 
did not make sense. "It was totally 
impractical," he said. "Those steps 
would work in a physical plant that had 
a much higher percentage of accessible 
rooms than we do." Instead, the Yale 
Weekry Bulletin and Calendar ran an 
announcement encouraging campus 
organizations 
to 
hold events in 
accessible buildings and included a list 
of such buildings. Liberman is still 
frustrated with the University's 
response. "The Yale administration by 
and large is opposed to change," she 
said, "and students didn't know how to 
rock the boat." Liberman resigned in 
August, 1988 to go to law school. 

After Liberman left, Long and the 
office's director, Ezra Stiles Dean R ita 
Lipson, changed the assistant director's 
job description. "It seemed to imply 
more independence and a higher level 
of authority and responsibility than 
was appropriate," said Long. Students 
needed a staff person who could attend 
to their needs while administrators 
dealt with questions of policy, Long 
said. "Rosette had some problems with 
deans and directors who thought the 
office was setting policy and making 
unreasonable demands," he explained. 
"We wanted to make sure they knew 
that the Resource Office was there to 
assist them." 

The new job description eliminated 
Liberman's "significant latitude" clause 
and focused on the assistant director's 
duties coordinating the office, rather 
than advising administrators. When 
john Hanna took over as assistant 
director in the fall of 1988, he was 
taken aback by the lack of authority the 
job allowed him. "I was told my 
authority was to be very severely 
restricted because Rosette Liberman 
had 
overstepped her boundaries," 
Hanna said. Even for day-to-day tasks 
such as assigni.ng. readers, Hanna had 
to get permission from Lipson, who 
worked out of a separate office. He 
objected to this arrangement. "One 
way you can discourage people from 
using services is to put them through a 
lot of red tape," Hanna said. 

Students in EASY complained that 
they weren't getting the services they 
needed when the Resource Office 
changed hands. In the spring of 1988, 
EASY 
member Judith Sandalow 
(LAW '90) had come to the office 
because her migraine headaches made 
it 
impossible 
for 
her to 
read. 
Liberman provided her with volunteer 
readers. In the fall, with Liberman 
gone, Sandalow discovered that the 
pool of volunteers had dissipated. She 
recruited her own readers from among 
her Law School peers, and sent them 
to the Resource Office to be paid. 
H anna had to authorize each pay· 
ment through the director, and Sandalow 
complained that the process took so 
long that she finished her assignments 
late. In December, ten members of 
EASY drafted a letter of complaint to 
Long, Presidel'\t Benno Schmidt and 
the Yale Corporation. In addition to 
citing Sandalow's grievances, 
among 
others. 
the letter recommended 


changes in the Resource Office. The 
students suggested that the office 
recruit more interpreters, improve 
awareness programs, and hire a part-time 
reader and library assistant. 

Hanna blamed 
many of the 
problems in the office on the Uni-
versity. He thought that Yale should 
pay for more help and give him more 
authority. But Lipson said Hanna did 
a poor job. One time, she said, she 
found him reading to a student him-
self, rather than supervising the office. 
"I wanted him to be more creative 
about finding people," she said. "The 
Resource Office last fall was in dread-
ful shape:" Long said. "Students were 
not getting the response they wanted. 
It was clear that it was time to hire 
someone with more ·administrative 
experience." 

Hanna accepted a buy-out of his 
contract in April. · In a letter to 
Schmidt, members of EASY claimed 
that the University had forced Hanna 
to resign, making hi'rtl a scapegoat for 
their complaints. "John has done an 
excellent job even with his hands tied 
and his voice silenced," they wrote. 
The students said Lipson and Long 
wanted to get rid of Hanna because he 
was sympathetic to their charges that 
the University was neglecting them. 
Hanna agreed. "I think they held me 
ultimately accountable for students' 
submitting their grievances," Hanna 
said. "I guess someone had to take the 
weight." 

Lipson said that Hanna's resignation 
had nothing to do with the EASY 
complaints, and that she never pres-
sured him to step down. "No one at 
this university asks people to resign," 
she said. Furthermore, L ipson said 
EASY members were too quick to con-
demn the University. "There is already 
a built-in suspicion that something is 
llQt going to be done," she said. "They 
begin complaining without giving the 
University a chance." While EASY 
~mbers felt that the University had 
Ignored their needs and undermined 
the power of their advocate in Hanna, 
Lipson and Long said that students 
lhowed an unwarranted hostility 
toward the administration. Savage, 
who heard about the controversy 
through Advisory Commi ttee 
meetings, said students blew 
the 
problem out of proportion. "It was my 
impression that there were a few 
students that were very angry," he 
said. 

The antagonism between admini-
strators and EASY members con-
tinued after Hanna left. This year, 
students objected to a new University 
policy which permits the school to 
require physical exams to determine 
their needs. When Long wrote the 
policy into the 1989 Undergraduate 
Regulations, members of EASY took 
.offense. "There's a perception that 
we're asking for things we don't need, 
trying to get stuff, and that we're not to 
be trusted," Brooks said. Long, how-
ever, said that a medical exam could 
help the University determine the best 
way to help students. "I think it's fair to 
say that a student is not always in the 
best position to know what he or she 
needs, or what current help is avail-
able," he said. "It's possible a student 
could request accomodations that the 
student thinks appropriate and the 
University thinks inappropriate." 

Long wrote the new policy after 
Sandalow complained that the Re· 
source Office director arbitrarily asked 
her for a doctor's evaluation. Sandalow 
thought Lipson made the request 
either in retaliation for her involve· 
ment with EASY, or because Lipson 
doubted the validity of her condition. 
"The implication was that because I 
didn't walk with a cane or have a dog, I 
didn't have a disability," she said. 

Lipson said she only asked for the 
examination 
in order to 
help 
Sandal ow. "I was not trying to pry," 
she said. "My intention was to get from 
the medical personnel how best to 
accomodate Judy." 

In order to allay the feeling of 
mistrust between disabled students and 
administrators, EASY requested that 
the University hire a Resource Office 
director who is disabled, and who is 
specifically trained 
in disabilities 
advocacy. The University restructured 
the Resource Office again this fall.

her duties as a college dean, the 
administration hired the first full-time, 
paid director who will work in the 
office. But members of EASY were 
disappointed that the administration 
passed over two applicants who met 
the student group's 
qualifications, 
including a disabilities organizer from 
Harvard. 

Faye Hanson, the new Resource 
Office director, has little 
formal 
training in working with disabilities, 
but said raising a daughter who is 
learning disabled has made her sen-
sitive to the issues important to her 
job. "I know about that whole business 
of being labeled and struggling for 
independence," she said. Hanson has a 
master's degree in sociology, and 
worked for ten years as an admini-
strator at the Medical School. The 
Resource Office's third manager in five 
years, she said she is making a fresh 
beginning. "I view it as a start-up 
project, one that will be develop-
mental," Hanson said. Although the 
Resource Office has just hired a part-
time secretary, Hanson said she needs 
fuU-time help. "fm finding it's an 
enormous job," she said. "The phones 
ring all day." 

Hanson's job is not much different 
from that of the former assistant 
director in that she is supposed to co-
ordinate services for students, rather 
than make recommendations to the 
administration. "It is our hope that 
having a director to do more of the 
day-to-day tasks, it will be possible to 
let the committee address issues of 
policy," Long said. Students argue that 
the University should give the 
Resource Office director more power 
to act as their advocate 
to the 
University. 

Weed was frustrated because Hanson, 
although she supported him in his battle 
over crossing the street, could do little to 
resolve the situation. "She should be an 
advocate, 
but in 
a 
pre-organized 
environment,• Weed said. •As it is it's 
very disorganized." Hanson agreed that 
the office needs to keep track of students' 
disabilities, but, she said, *Each person's 
needs are very different. You can't 
~trapolate that ·of one to another." 

She characterized the debate over 
Weed as a matter of opinion. "We all 
have our own biases," she said. "He 
put up a good fight." Trachtenberg 
maintains that working with disabled 
students on a flexible and informal 
basis makes sense. " I don't think any 
student here is in the province of one 
office," she said. "It's a decentralized 
place, and lots of people are in on 
decisions." 

While Hanson deals directly with 
students, the Advisory Committee 
plans to discuss how the University 
should address questions of disabilities 
in general. Aware of the hostilities of 
last year, Savage wants to build com-
munication with students by matching 
them with members of the committee. 
"The idea is to take the fifty-odd 
students who are our clients and divide 
them into groups of four, assigning 
them to committee members," he 
said. 

Meanwhile, EASY members are 
continuing to work out their own 
agenda. They have created subcom-
mittees to study the issues of the 
medical examination policy, accessi-
bility to buildings, and hiring a 
disabled staff person for the Resource 
Office. Brooks said that as long as the 
number of disabled students is so low, 
they will continue to deal with their 
concerns little by little. "It's not easy to 
be disabled at Yale," she said. "There 
are so many issues, and so few of us."
