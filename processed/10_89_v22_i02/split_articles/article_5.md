nightfall did come, I had no reason to 
believe that the sun would rise the next 
day. After class, I begged a junior to 
let me into the basement of Branford. 
(It was the nearest college and I didn't 
have a key.) I found my way through 
the basement maze to Branford's two 
pool tables. I held my breath in 
anticipation as someone brought the 
tip of his cue to bear on the white ball. 
The ball rolled quickly towards a red 
ball at the far end of the table. When 
the white ball collided with the red ball, 
the red ball began rolling towards the 
corner pocket and sank. I thought it 
would. 


Beyond refuting philosophical skepticism, many addicts relish the science 
of pool. Dave Toker (BK '91 ), who 
advocates a multivaried approach to 
the study of pool, says, "Once you get 
past the basic particle physics and start 
contemplating topspin, backspin and 
English, pool becomes a science filled 
with unimaginably beautiful complex-
ities." Even physics text books that deal 
with lofty concepts like Conservation of 
Linear M omentum must oversimplify the 
game of pool to describe the collision of 
billiard balls. For example, the classic 
billiard ball problem begins with the 
phrase, 
"Assume 
a 
frictionless 
table ... " Toker, who has pushed for 
the intrarnuralization of pool, tells of a 
"short computer science major with a 
ponytail named Denny" who mastered 
the science of pool: 


"It was at the GPSCY one night, and 
I had just scratched. The cue ball was 
put on the close side of the table. It was 
Denny's turn. Denny made some quick 
measurements with his cue and then 
shot his ball with this obscure spin 
called 'throw' at the far bumper. The 
ball came off the bumper and returned 
all the way back across the length of the 
table. The eight-ball was sitting near 
the close bumper. On the return trip, 
the cue ball cut the eight-ball just to its 
left and sent it rolling slowly towards 
the right corner pocket. The eight-ball 
sunk. I couldn't believe my eyes. I said 
to myself, 'There is a lot more to this 
game than I know."' 


Besides the 
science of pool, the 
representations of pool in art and 
popular culture contribute to its allure. 
Images of pool usually romanticize the 
sleazy. Playing pool at Yale enables the 
academic to find the hustler embedded 
deep within him. It feels like a descent 
into depravity. 
Mike 
McGoldrick 
(SY '91 ), a Saybrook pool compatriot, 
confided to me recently that he would 
give anything to be George C. Scott's 
character in The H ustler for j ust one day. 
"I mean, when you talk about seedy," 
says McGoldrick, "you think of Scott's 
brilliant performance. Now that is 
sleaze in all its glory." I have a friend in 
Trumbull from Boca R aton, Florida 
who models 
himself after 
the 
Minnesota legend and insists that 


people call him "Boca-Fats." 


T he location of the pool tables at 
Yale, in the bowels of the residential 
colleges, reinforces the mythic quality 
of sleaze. 
The 
rooms and 
their 
grunginess evoke pool's su bversive 
tradition: cigar smoke, back rooms, 
and gambling. L_ike Edward H opper's 
portrayals of motels, diners, and city 
streets, 
the Yale · student's com-
mitment to pool is a quest for the 
noble in that which soc1ety holds in 
disrepute. 


In neglecting the pool rooms in the 
residential colleges., the administration 
has 
unwitt ing~y .;·reinforced 
pool's 
subversive aspects. The slanting tables 
with warped bumpers and tipless cues, 
set in cramped and musty spaces of the 
college basements, help students live 
out the underworld qualities of the 
game. Last year, Master Ann Ameling of 
Saybrook tried to get some control 
over this situation, by introducing a 
new policy regarding pool. She re-
moved the sole cue from the Saybrook 
pool room so that students must now 
check the cue out of her office to play. 
Her office is only open from ten until 
4:30, 
with 
long lunch 
break. 
policy greatly restricts the 
accessibility of the game and creates a 
persistent, 
subtle 
tension 
between 
residents of the college and the Master. 
But Master Ameling has underesti-
mated the true nature of pool players 
at Yale. "Don't worry about it," Blake 
said to me when I expressed alarm at 
the situation. "There are still a few 
cheap cues at the mall."
