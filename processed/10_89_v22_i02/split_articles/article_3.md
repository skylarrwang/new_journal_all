Yale in.Japan

The Imperial Court resided in Kyoto
until 1868 when Edo, or modern-day
Tokyo, became the capital of Japan.
Kyoto, with its meandering canals, old
temples
and shrines,
and cherry
blossom trees, moves at a slower pace
than cosmopolitan Tokyo. Kyoto's
streets are regular, laid out in a grid,
far less crowded than Tokyo's busy
thoroughfares. Within this setting,
lying on an old aristocratic estate, is
the Kyoto Center for Japan Studies.

This year 30 Americans, including one
Yale student, are living in Kyoto and
taking classes at the center.

When Bill Hornung (TC '91) weiu
to KCJS this semester, Yale officially
launched its first program for under-
graduate study in japan. Yale is one of
nine
universities
involved
in
KCJS,
which Stanford University
administers. The program's courses
vary from year to year, depending on
the expertise of the faculty, who are
drawn from Japanese institutions and
from the
participating American
univers1t1es.
Generally, instructors
teach Japanese language as well as
economics, history, literature, political
science and religion- which are all in
English. Japanese students sufficiently
advanced in English take classes with
the Americans. American students also
can take courses taught in Japanese at
the prestigious Kyoto University,
which is affiliated with KCJS.

Yale College will give as much as a
year of credit for study at KCJS, and
allows courses taken in Kyoto to count
both toward a student's major and
toward graduation requirements. Yale
recognizes only one other junior-year-
abroad program, Yale-in-London.
Unlike the London program, however,
letter grades earned in Kyo to do not
appear on a student's transcript.

KCJS is not yet Yale-in-Kyoto.
Nevertheless, the Kyoto program has
elminated the need for students to lug
back a year's worth of tests, essays and
notes as evidence of their studies, as
they must for all other overseas
programs outside of London.

When the Kyoto Center opened
only a year ago, Professor of Japanese
history Conrad Totman, then chair-
man of the Council on East Asian
Studies, pushed to get Yale involved in
the program. He said he wanted to
send undergraduates to a rigorous
academic institution in japan, in order
to study the country at close range.

The council's current chairman,
W 'illiam Kelly,
professor of
anthropology, explained, "We saw a
need for a program suited for japan
students with ever-increasing exper-
tise. Students going to Japan now are
better
prepared
than
their
predecessors were ten or 20 years ago.
The existing programs in Japan either
~re all but filled to capacity, or do not
meet Yale's high academic standards."

The initiation of this program
reflects the growing interest among
students in the.study of Japan and Asia
both at Yale and at other universities in
the United States. Although the major-
ity of Yale students going abroad still
travel across the Atlantic- to France,
England, Spain,
and
the Soviet
Union-the number of those heading
to Japan, China, Hong Kong and
Korea is steadily increasing. The
percentage of Yale juniors going to
Asian countries to study rose from
3
percent five
years ago to 11
percent last year, according to the
Junior Year Abroad Office. The num-
ber of those who went to Japan tripled.

Each year, Yale can send three
qualified students to Kyoto through
the new program, where they join
students from Brown, the University
of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell,
Harvard, the University of Michigan,
Princeton and Stanford.

Hornung, the only Yale student ever
to participate,
decided
to
live in the all-male Sumitomo Bank
dormitory. Other options for students
at the Center include residing with Zen
Buddhist monks,
living in an
apartment, or staying with a Japanese
family.

Totman and Kelly hope that students'
experience abroad will complement the
structure of the East Asian Studies
major and other language-intensive
majors. A year spent in the country of
their specialty is a natural culmination
to the years of language preparation
and culture study for students at Yale.

Letters
To the Editor:

A
comment on "Philosophical
Differences" (September 8, 1989). You
refer to a New York Times article
of December 29, 1987 as reflecting
" an ideological battle" among
philosophers.

In that article, I said that to frame
differences among philosophers as
analytical-vs-non-analytical was
beat a
straw
man.
(The article
misquoted me as saying "straw horse",
an interesting synthesis). My views
have therefore not "softened" as you
claim. They are now as they were
then.

Since I came to Yale in 1973, two
senior faculty have taken positions
elsewhere. One junior faculty member
who was granted tenure also left. It is
very probably the case that many other
departments have lost tenured faculty
during those sixteen years.

You failed to note that senior faculty
like myself who receive offers from
"prestigious institutions"
may
also
decline such offers and stay at Yale. In
acad me as elsewhere
there
considerable demand and conse-
quently considerable mobility.
