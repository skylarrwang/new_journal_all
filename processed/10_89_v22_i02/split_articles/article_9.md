concern about authority and how 
women can work in the church," said 
Sorensen. 

The YDS Women's Center stands 
out as a vigorous campus force. In 
discussions and forums, the center tries 
to expose students to issues of justice 
for women. Inclusive language is, of 
course, a paramount issue, and the 
Women's Center sponsored a forum on 
the subject October 6 and 7. Last year, 
the center ran an educational cam-
paign on sexual violence 
against 
women, and this year Bashi plans to 
initiate 
discussion of reproductive 
rights. "These are issues that the 
church hasn't done justice to," said 
Bashi. "I'm concerned to raise the issue 
in such- a way that productive dis-
cussion happens, but I'm not sure if 
that's possible," she said. 

Bashi's 
fears of. unproductive 
discussion may stem from the spec-
trum of attitudes toward women on 
campus. "There ar~ people who take 
very seriously the feminist perspec-
tive," said Sorensen. "But I think 
there's also a prett~ strong counter-
attitude that 
takes 
the 
form of 
trivializing the concerns of women." 

Discussion may prove difficult because 
students are wary of expressing strong 
opinions. "I think there's a fairly large 
group of people who just don't see it as 
an issue either way and are fearful of 
controversy and strong feeling on 
either side," said Sorensen. 

Early in September, the Women's 
Center organized a sermon in which 
the women leading the service asked 
for prayers in support of justice and 
equality for women. After the service, 
three men approached Scott 
Williamson, a second-year student and 
chairman of the Social Action Com-
mittee, 
and complained 
that 
service was too political; its goal was no 
longer prayerful, they said. "They 
will recognize the political agenda 
whenever it moves to change the 
existing political status quo," said 
Geter. Greer thinks there are other 
forums more productive for mobili-
zing people to action than a sermon. 
"The preacher has a captive audi-
ence. If the audience 
feels 
like 
~t's being 
sold 
a 
bill of goods 
â€¢t gets turned off," he said.
