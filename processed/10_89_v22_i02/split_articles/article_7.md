The letter has brought on a storm of 
violent emotions since it arrived in 
Poussaint's hands in May. "My first 
reaction was that· it had to be a forgery, 
that no professor from Yale would 
write that," Poussaint said. Calling its 
language "crudely racist,!' he sent 
copies of the letter to Yale English 
department Cliairman Richard 
Brodhead and President Benno 
Schmidt. 

Brodhead replied to 
Poussaint that whiie he took exception 
to Theroux's remarks, any punitive 
action against the professor would 
violate University free-speech policies. 
Dissatisfied 
with Yale's reply, 
Poussaint decided to make the matter 
public, and gave a copy of Theroux's 
letter to Boston Globe columnist Derrick 
Z. Jackson. Like Poussaint, J ackson is 
black; like Poussaint, he condemned 
Theroux's language and Yale's refusal 
to take action. And since jackson made 
the letter the focus of an August 
column, a number of issues- inclu-
ding Yale's policies relating to racism 
and free speech- have become the 
focus of heated debate. 

"One thing I hear so often is that 
racism doesn't exist anymore," said 
Elise Boddie, co-moderator of the 
Black Student Alliance at Yale. "But 
people seem to forget that racism today 
is more than seeing black people 
horsewhipped and lynched." While 
Boddie and Poussaint accept that 
Theroux wrote his letter in haste and 
~nger, they object to his character-
IZation of the rapists as "monkeys," a 
word taken to refer to blacks as 
subhuman or 
genetically 
inferior. 

"Theroux should have known better 
than to write such garbage," another 
reader wrote to the Globe this fall. 
Beyond the question of Theroux's 
language, Yale's own image was put at 
risk, some have charged, when he 
addressed his personal note on English 
department stationery; it implied that 
Theroux was speaking as a representa-
tive of the department. Theroux said 
that the Yale-embossed paper was all 
he had in his desk at the time, and any 
charges that he tried to give his words 
official weight 
with 
its 
use are 
"ludicrous." 

Brodhead reproached Theroux for 
his use of Yale stationery to express his 
personal views, but did not pursue any 
punitive measures. "You will obviously 
recognize the inappropriateness of my 
officially censoring the views (however 
repugnant) of anyone connected with 
this place," 
Brodhead wrote to 
Poussaint this June. He emphasized 
that Theroux's remarks were not 
endorsed by Yale or the department, 
but characterized the debate over 
Theroux's words as a question of free 
speech. Universities, he said, are not 
in a position to fire employees for the 
letters they 
write. "Of course 
I 
understand that students may be offen-
ded," he said, "but we still have an 
obligation of fair treatment." 

In his 18 years at Yale, Brodhead 
said, he cannot recall a single instance 
in which a professor was dismissed for 
using offensive language, and depart-
ments usually handle such complaints 
internally. "It hasn't struck anybody 
that this situation is so egregious as to 
warrant a departure from the way 
things are usually done," he said. 

Other Yale faculty and students hold 
that Theroux's letter may compromise 
his 
role as a 
professor. 
Frances 
Holloway, director of Yale's affir-
mative action office, officially supports 
the department's decision to honor 
Theroux's remaining one-year con-
tract. But in light of his letter, she said, 
"I would have reservations about his 
evaluations of black students' work." 

Boddie, 
too, 
worries that 
the 
information Theroux conveys to stu-
dents in class might contain the same 
biases she found so offensive in his 
letter. 

Von H ughes, a former student of 
Theroux's, told Jackson that, as a 
professor of writing, Theroux should 
have been particularly conscious of his 
choice of language. "Theroux told us in 
class about the force of words and how 
words convey feelings," Hughes said. 
"When he wrote that, he had to have 
known the exact impact he wanted to 
have." 

Theroux maintains that he has done 
nothing to warrant this barrage of 
criticism. He said that he wrote the 
letter in a rage, but that any racist 
interpretations are unfounded. "I have 
no problems with being considered a 
bigot because that's the last thing I 
am," he said. "Aren't English pro-
fes~ors allowed to get angry?" Cate-
gori'zing the black men who raped the 
jogger as "monkeys" may have been 
injudiciousJ he said, but he was 
attempting to d~scribe- their actions, 
not their skin color. "I never intended 
any insult to the black COJ!lmunity," he 
said. "I don't think that black people 
look like monkeys. I used that as an 
example that the rapists were anima}s, 
that their behavior was animalistic." 

Why did Theroux choose the word 
"monkeys," then, with all the historical 
connotations that word holds? "Why 
not?" responded Theroux. "I never 
really thought once of that. I could 
have said jackals." 

Theroux said that a 
few hasty 
remarks are no grounds on which to 
judge him. He cites his writings, 
novels which he said explicitly 
condemn bigotry and prejudice, as 
evidence that he is 
not racist. 

"Everyone's throwing a shit fit about 
one word," he said, "but I've got two fat 
volumes of prose to counterbalance it." 

Theroux also said that his critics 
missed the point of his letter: that a 
rape cannot be excused by attributing 
it to social anger on the part of the 
perpetrators. In making this point, 
Theroux was not alone; other viewers 
also wrote 
letters objecting 
to 
Poussaint's remarks on the Brinkley 
show. In a letter to the Globe, for 
example, Margaret Hagen, associate 
professor of psychology at Boston 
University, critic'ized Poussaint's 
analysis and Jackson's reference to the 
rape as a "mugging." "Both Poussaint 
and Jackson legitimize, and indeed 
institutionalize, 
a 
depth of sexist 
hatred so great that it virtually 
guarantees the commission of violent 
attacks against women," she wrote. 

Theroux said that Poussaint's remarks 
seemed to him an attempt to excuse the 
rape. "I thought he tried to explain it 
away, .not just explain it," Theroux 
said. "In trying to align that to a higher 
agenda, or a personal agenda, it mocks 
the near death of the. woman." 

As far as racism goes, Theroux said, 
"the point of the letter was actually 
anti-racist." In a Globe Letter to the 
Editor Theroux wrote, "By calling 
those thugs 'angry,' Poussaint falsely 
assigns them a $ociological and/or 
political agenda, suggests this mitigates 
the crime, and actually creates racists 
himself." This kind of injustice 
continues, Theroux said, when blacks 
try to portray him as a bigot. "It's very 
interesting," he said, "how racism 
always seems to be against whites." 

It is unlikely that the University will 
take disciplinary 
action 
against 
Theroux. The only clear-cut rule he 
has violated is the ban on using official 
stationery 
for 
personal 
correspon-
dence, and Brodhead has privately 
rebuked him for doing so. But Boddie 
and other students insist that Theroux 
should be punished under Yale's racial 
and ethnic harrassment regulations. 

Although he did not address his 
remarks to a 
particular student, 
Boddie said, his language and attitude 
are a significant slight to all black 
students at Yale. Poussaint agrees. 

"This is so hurtful and damaging to 
people that you have to stand up ang 
say, 'No, you can't do this,"' he said. 
"Look at the harm you may be doing, 
having students who are wary of him 
and his attitude." 

No precedent exists to show how the 
University would evaluate a grievance 
against Theroux. Professor of psycho-
logy William Kessen, who chaired the 
President's Committee on Racial and 
Ethnic Harrassment until this year, 
said that no student has ever brought a 
complaint before the eight-year-old 
committee. "Unlike most University 
committees, the rules are not codified 
in any sense," Kessen said. "But there 
has to be a complainant. Someone has 
to come forward and say, 'I have been 
injured.'" 

Theroux remains confident that his 
reputation at Yale will bear no scars 
from the recent controversy. "The 
reason I wasn't fired is not because of 
free speech, it's because the English 
department knew I'm not a racist," he 
said. 

Theroux's second one-year contract 
is up for renewal in April, and 
Brodhead declined to comment on the 
effect that Theroux's letter will have on 
his reappointment. "We'll consider 
everything that's pertinent," he said. 

Holloway said she is satisfied with the 
administration's actions, 
since 
visiting professor's misstatements are 
much less damaging to the University's 
image than a 
tenured professsor's 
would have been. 

At BSAY's first meeting this semester, 
the group discussed taking action 
against Theroux, but has not decided 
whether it will formally petition the 
Committee on Racial and Ethnic 
Harrassment. Although Boddie wants 
to see Theroux fired, she does not 
think it will happen. "I've had enough 
dealings with this administration to 
know 
that 
isn't on Benno 
Schmidt's agenda," she said. For now, 
Boddie said that BSA Y's goal will be to 
publicize Theroux's letter. "If 
professors 
they'll 
be held · 
accountable, that will at least make 
them more careful of what they write 
or say in the future," she said. 

Theroux is as eager to clear his 
name of any charges of racism as 
BSA Y is to pursue them. He said that 
many of his detractors have deli-
berately misrepresented his comments, 
while others have misunderstood 
them. 

As 
famous 
psychiatrist, 
Poussaint is motivated by his own 
wounded pride, Theroux said, not by 
the content of the letter. "He's not used 
to anything but deference and slipper-
kissing," Theroux wrote in a letter to 
the managing editor of the Globe. 

Theroux has threatened Boddie with 
a libel suit if she or BSA Y make any 
public "false suggestions" about his 
letter. He also warned the Globe this 
summer that Jackson's column might 
soon bring them to court, although 
Globe lawyers have said that Theroux's 
case against them is weak. Theroux 
has told the Globe that he may produce 
even more written words on the topic, 
possibly a response in the Boston Herald 
to Jackson's Globe column. Unlike 
some of his summer correspondences, 
Theroux said, the Herald piece is one 
he "would 
positively 
relish 
writing."
