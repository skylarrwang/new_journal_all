Yale 
committees have been deliberating 
over the problem for two years. Plans 
to build a ramp to UCS also have yet 
to emerge from the Advisory Commit-
tee. "It's hard," H auser said. "There 
are handicapped recruiters who I have 
to tell not to come." 

Other inaccessible buildings on 
campus include the post office, the 
Affirmative Action Office, Sprague 
Hall and all of the cultural centers. 
"Nearly every place where student 
services are performed is inaccessible," 
said Savage, who uses a wheelchair 
himself. "It just makes life awkward 
and difficult." As chairman qf ·the 
Advisory Committee, Savage said that 
making academic buildings accessible 
must take priority over helping stu-
dents participate in extracurricular 
activities. 

Granting access to buildings is only 
. one way in which the University must 
accomodate disabled students under 
the law. In 1985, the University 
opened the Resource Office for Stu-
dents and Employees with Disabilities, 
which currently serves about 50 
members of the Yale community. The 
office finds guides and readers for the 
visually disabled, scribes for students 
who cannot write, and sign-language 
interpreters for the hearing-impaired. 
The office also provides a range of 
equipment, including tape recorders, 
auditory assistors, a Braille typewriter 
and printer, 
and 
a 
Kurzweiler 
Reading Machine-a computer that 
scans text and reads it aloud. 

Since the Resource Office opened, 
two of its managers have resigned, and 
students and administrators have 
argued about how the office should 
function. The first person to manage 
the Resource Office was Rosette 
Liberman, a Ph.D. candidate from the 
University of Bridgeport. Her work as 
assistant director became the basis for 
her doctoral dissertation entitled 
"The Management of Post-secondary 
Institutions in Compliance with Sec-
tion 504." Liberman wrote her own job 
description, assigning herself "signi-
ficant latitude for the exercise of 
independent judgement." She started a 
number of projects, which included 
establishing contact with the New 
Haven branch of Readings for the Blind, 
developing 
pool of student 
volunteers to serve as readers and 
guides, and making numerous recom-
mendations to the Yale administration 
about improving disabled students' 
access to University resources. 

During her three-year tenure, 
Liberman proposed a 
policy that 
required that all student organizations 
hold their meetings 
in accessible 
buildings or move them on demand. 
Deputy Provost Long rejected. the 
proposal, contending that forcing all 
the organizations on campus to move 
did not make sense. "It was totally 
impractical," he said. "Those steps 
would work in a physical plant that had 
a much higher percentage of accessible 
rooms than we do." Instead, the Yale 
Weekry Bulletin and Calendar ran an 
announcement encouraging campus 
organizations 
to 
hold events in 
accessible buildings and included a list 
of such buildings. Liberman is still 
frustrated with the University's 
response. "The Yale administration by 
and large is opposed to change," she 
said, "and students didn't know how to 
rock the boat." Liberman resigned in 
August, 1988 to go to law school. 

After Liberman left, Long and the 
office's director, Ezra Stiles Dean R ita 
Lipson, changed the assistant director's 
job description. "It seemed to imply 
more independence and a higher level 
of authority and responsibility than 
was appropriate," said Long. Students 
needed a staff person who could attend 
to their needs while administrators 
dealt with questions of policy, Long 
said. "Rosette had some problems with 
deans and directors who thought the 
office was setting policy and making 
unreasonable demands," he explained. 
"We wanted to make sure they knew 
that the Resource Office was there to 
assist them." 

The new job description eliminated 
Liberman's "significant latitude" clause 
and focused on the assistant director's 
duties coordinating the office, rather 
than advising administrators. When 
john Hanna took over as assistant 
director in the fall of 1988, he was 
taken aback by the lack of authority the 
job allowed him. "I was told my 
authority was to be very severely 
restricted because Rosette Liberman 
had 
overstepped her boundaries," 
Hanna said. Even for day-to-day tasks 
such as assigni.ng. readers, Hanna had 
to get permission from Lipson, who 
worked out of a separate office. He 
objected to this arrangement. "One 
way you can discourage people from 
using services is to put them through a 
lot of red tape," Hanna said. 

Students in EASY complained that 
they weren't getting the services they 
needed when the Resource Office 
changed hands. In the spring of 1988, 
EASY 
member Judith Sandalow 
(LAW '90) had come to the office 
because her migraine headaches made 
it 
impossible 
for 
her to 
read. 
Liberman provided her with volunteer 
readers. In the fall, with Liberman 
gone, Sandalow discovered that the 
pool of volunteers had dissipated. She 
recruited her own readers from among 
her Law School peers, and sent them 
to the Resource Office to be paid. 
H anna had to authorize each pay· 
ment through the director, and Sandalow 
complained that the process took so 
long that she finished her assignments 
late. In December, ten members of 
EASY drafted a letter of complaint to 
Long, Presidel'\t Benno Schmidt and 
the Yale Corporation. In addition to 
citing Sandalow's grievances, 
among 
others. 
the letter recommended 


changes in the Resource Office. The 
students suggested that the office 
recruit more interpreters, improve 
awareness programs, and hire a part-time 
reader and library assistant. 

Hanna blamed 
many of the 
problems in the office on the Uni-
versity. He thought that Yale should 
pay for more help and give him more 
authority. But Lipson said Hanna did 
a poor job. One time, she said, she 
found him reading to a student him-
self, rather than supervising the office. 
"I wanted him to be more creative 
about finding people," she said. "The 
Resource Office last fall was in dread-
ful shape:" Long said. "Students were 
not getting the response they wanted. 
It was clear that it was time to hire 
someone with more ·administrative 
experience." 

Hanna accepted a buy-out of his 
contract in April. · In a letter to 
Schmidt, members of EASY claimed 
that the University had forced Hanna 
to resign, making hi'rtl a scapegoat for 
their complaints. "John has done an 
excellent job even with his hands tied 
and his voice silenced," they wrote. 
The students said Lipson and Long 
wanted to get rid of Hanna because he 
was sympathetic to their charges that 
the University was neglecting them. 
Hanna agreed. "I think they held me 
ultimately accountable for students' 
submitting their grievances," Hanna 
said. "I guess someone had to take the 
weight." 

Lipson said that Hanna's resignation 
had nothing to do with the EASY 
complaints, and that she never pres-
sured him to step down. "No one at 
this university asks people to resign," 
she said. Furthermore, L ipson said 
EASY members were too quick to con-
demn the University. "There is already 
a built-in suspicion that something is 
llQt going to be done," she said. "They 
begin complaining without giving the 
University a chance." While EASY 
~mbers felt that the University had 
Ignored their needs and undermined 
the power of their advocate in Hanna, 
Lipson and Long said that students 
lhowed an unwarranted hostility 
toward the administration. Savage, 
who heard about the controversy 
through Advisory Commi ttee 
meetings, said students blew 
the 
problem out of proportion. "It was my 
impression that there were a few 
students that were very angry," he 
said. 

The antagonism between admini-
strators and EASY members con-
tinued after Hanna left. This year, 
students objected to a new University 
policy which permits the school to 
require physical exams to determine 
their needs. When Long wrote the 
policy into the 1989 Undergraduate 
Regulations, members of EASY took 
.offense. "There's a perception that 
we're asking for things we don't need, 
trying to get stuff, and that we're not to 
be trusted," Brooks said. Long, how-
ever, said that a medical exam could 
help the University determine the best 
way to help students. "I think it's fair to 
say that a student is not always in the 
best position to know what he or she 
needs, or what current help is avail-
able," he said. "It's possible a student 
could request accomodations that the 
student thinks appropriate and the 
University thinks inappropriate." 

Long wrote the new policy after 
Sandalow complained that the Re· 
source Office director arbitrarily asked 
her for a doctor's evaluation. Sandalow 
thought Lipson made the request 
either in retaliation for her involve· 
ment with EASY, or because Lipson 
doubted the validity of her condition. 
"The implication was that because I 
didn't walk with a cane or have a dog, I 
didn't have a disability," she said. 

Lipson said she only asked for the 
examination 
in order to 
help 
Sandal ow. "I was not trying to pry," 
she said. "My intention was to get from 
the medical personnel how best to 
accomodate Judy." 

In order to allay the feeling of 
mistrust between disabled students and 
administrators, EASY requested that 
the University hire a Resource Office 
director who is disabled, and who is 
specifically trained 
in disabilities 
advocacy. The University restructured 
the Resource Office again this fall.
