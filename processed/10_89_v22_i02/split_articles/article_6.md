Alexander Theroux was furious. 
Two weeks 
after last spring's Cen-
tral Park rape, 
the Yale 
English 
professor watched a discussion of the 
incident on ABC-TV's "This Week 
with David Brinkley." Panelist Alvin 
Poussaint, a Harvard psychiatrist, was 
asked what could have driven the 
group of teenagers to commit such a 
heinous crime. "The key question to 
ask is why these kids were angry," 
Poussaint said, "angry enough that 
they would go out . . . and rape and 
almost kill someone." 


Theroux, who had known the victim 
from her days as a graduate student, 
sat down at his old manual typewriter 
and banged out the following letter on 
a sheet of Yale-embossed stationery:

Dear Dr, POUSPaint, 
Your description of 
the black men who ganged up to rape 
and virtually beat to death a woman 
in Central Park as "Rngry" implies 
a sort of state of mind inherited 
from the collective unconscious , 1. 
e, you know, ye~s ago Emmett Till 
was unjustly murdered in Mississippi 
and so these guys in April, 1989, 
disenfranchised , economicall;r. under-
advantaged, etc. are "angry.' Do you 
realize·, by dragging in such 11high 
principles , " that in your, what, de-
lusion and/or overearnestnese by such 
cant you make thousands of racists 
on the spot in whites who are sick 
of such rubbish? 
Why not go on tele-
vision 13.nd admit it -- those guys 
were horny, ruck crazy, macho-
bewildered. , uneducated monkeys who 
aren't ready for civilization? 
The t~uth may hurt, but 1t 1 s the 
only place to beg in. 
Yours~ 
(Prof) Alexander Th eroux
