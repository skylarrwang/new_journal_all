much of the city. citizens argue that 
Yale should invest more-in New Haven 
and commit to local investments that 
may not fill the university coffers as 
fast as Yale would like. Fernandez of 
HDC believes that as the city's major 
landowner, the 
University has a 
responsibility to get ;·more involved. 
"As a good citizen they should be 
looking for investment opportunities in 
New Haven that might not give the 
same returns as they would get on Wall 
Street. But they will get a return, and 
not only that, they'll help stabilize the 
New Haven economy, which will help 
them in the long run," he said. 
Yale administrators expect that the 
University will continue to grow. 
"We're interested in acquiring a large 
~ract of land for future development," 
said Marsha Ryan of Yale's Real 
Estate Office, "though there are 
no plans for that now." As long as 
Yale 
remains New Haven's big-
gest property owner, and the land is 
the city's main source of tax reven-
ue, how much Yale owns and how it 
invests in property will be impor-
tant issues for New Haven. "Yale 
has to be a good neighbor," said 
Toni Harp, alderwoman from Ward 
Two. 
As the University expands 
further into the city's neighbor-
hoods, it is bound to encounter more 
residents who feel the same way.
