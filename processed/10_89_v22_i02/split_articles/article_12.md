For four days at the beginning of the 
term, Matthew Weed (SM '93) argued 
with the Yale College Dean's Office 
about where he should cross the street. 
Weed, 
who 
is 
Yale's 
first 
blind 
undergraduate in ten years, said he 
had trouble navigating the diagonal 
crosswalk at the intersection of Grove 
and College without wandering out 
into traffic. Instead, he wanted to cross 
Grove Street near the unmarked inter-
section at Hillhouse Avenue. But Dean 
William DiCanzio of Silliman insisted 
that he use the diagonal crosswalk, 
which is near a traffic light, or else take 
a guide with him. Weed said he 
wanted to cross by himself. 
When neither the dean nor Weed 
would give in, DiCanzio took the 
matter to Betty Trachtenberg, dean of 
freshman affairs. Trachtenberg also 
insisted that Weed cross at the light. 
Finally, Chris Foy, a mobility instructor 
with the Connecticut Board of Education 
and Services for the Blind, intervened and 
convinced the deans to let Weed cross by 
himself at the Hillhouse intersection. 
Weed is one of approximately 50

students with disabilities who rely on 
services from Yale. Recently, many of 
these students have become increas-
ingly vocal about what they see as the 
University's failure 
to meet their 
needs. "I wasn't surprised that the 
University was unready," Weed said, 
"but it's frustrating that they're as 
unready as they are." Last December, 
Equal Access for Students at Yale 
(EASY), a group of disabled students, 
sent a letter to Deputy Provost Charles 
Long enumerating their complaints. 
The group claimed that bureaucratic 
inefficiency, inadequate resources, and 
poor accessibility to buildings inter-
fered with their education. "It is hard 
to know where to begin to answer your 
many concerns and suggestions," Long 
wrote back. "However, I want you to 
know 
that 
the administration 
emphatically committed to finding a 
solution to them." 
Since 1980, Yale has been de-
veloping programs to meet the needs of 
disabled students. But as students with 
a variety of different disabilities enter 
the University, administrators, deans, 
professors and counselors have dealt 
with 
each 
individual 
differently, 
forming policy as they go along. 
Under a 1978 federal law-Section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act- insti-
tutions which receive federal funds 
must "operate their federally assisted

programs or activities so that when 
viewed in their entirety they are 
readily accessible to handicapped 
persons." Yal~ formed the Advisory 
Committee on Disabilities in response 
to the law in 1980. Since it first met,


the committee has mainly concerned 
itself with 
installing ramps 
and 
removing barriers so that mobility-
impaired students can move around 
the campus more easily. Each year the 
committee recommends improvements 
to make the University more acces-
sible, such as installing elevators at 
Cross Campus Library and the Yale 
Repertory Theater. 
David Heaton, a fifth-year graduate 
student in sociology and a member of 
EASY, lobbied for two years to get a 
ramp built at the statistics lab on 
Prospect Street. One year, 
the 
University put in a .temporary ramp, 
but Heaton decided it was 
too 
dangerous. The 
s~cond year, the 
Buildings and Gr<il;mds Committee 
rejected plans because it deemed them 
ugly. 
While fellow graduate 
students collaborated with advisors in 
the new lab, Heaton, who uses a 
wheelchair, had to do his lab work 
alone on a computer in his room. 
"Usually projects are finished after 
the students involved will be gone," 
said Richard Savage, chairman of the 
Advisory Committee. Yale's Gothic 
architecture, with its many gates and 
staircases, coupled with the enormous 
cost of renovation, slows down the 
committee's progres!!. A single per-
manent ramp can cost up to $50,000 to 
install. Since the committee's annual 
budget is $100,000, the University 
asks 
individual departments 
graduate schools to fund some pro-
jects. 
But departments also 
feel 
bu<;jgetary constraints, and the plans 
get delayed. In 1986, the committee 
proposed installing a ramp at the 
Divinity School, when a student in a 
wheelchair enrolled. The ramp was not 
constructed until the student's last 
semester. "We did a detailed plan for -
the Divinity School ramp," said Wint 
Cannon, senior architect for Archi-
tectural and Engineering Services, 
"but no one could decide who should 
pay for it." 
Since there are so few students who 
need modifications like ramps (five 
wheelchair users currently attend 
Yale), and because of the problems of 
time and expense, administrators try 
to find more expedient ways to acco-
modate these students. Before the start of 
each term, Associate Registrar David Mills 
contacts mobility-impaired undergraduates 
to make sure they can get to all the classes 
they are considering taking. "I start talking 
to them a month before school begins, and 
we discuss what they are going to shop. 
We make up a bunch of scenarios- if they 
take this class, we'll put it in this building," 
he said. 
Although the Univer.slty makes sure 
that students in wheelchairs can take 
the classes they want, these students 
cannot participate in many non-
academic activities held in inaccessible 
buildings. Shortly after he arrived, 
Heaton proposed that the University 
make the bar at the Graduate and 
Professional Student Center at Yale 
(GPSCY) accessible, but after three 
years of planning, the cost of a ramp 
has increased to $100,000. The Uni-
versity has yet to move forward on the 
project. 
Another member of EASY, Jo 
Brooks (BK '90), called University 
Career Services to see whether she 
could use the resource library there. 
"They said, 'Well, it kind of, it really, it 
depends on you, and what you're wil-
ling to do.' They meant, am I willing to 
let someone carry me up and down the 
stairs into the building? Now that's a 
precarious position for Yale to put 
itself in-one, it's humiliating and two, 
you don't want to be hurt." Dean 
Susan Hauser, director of UCS, said 
she wants to move the resource library 
to an accessible room in the UCS 
building. But the room is specifically

Richard Savage hopes Yale will move quickly to make the campus 
accessible to the disabled.
