EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Two summers ago, a group of skin-
head subletters trashed a building on 
Edgewood Avenue. The narrow, two-story structure stood vacant and gutted 
for 
a 
year, with boards covering 
the windows and weeds growing up 
around the porch. Yale students who 
live off campuS- now call the building 
the "crack house," and rumors abound 
about the illicit activities that went on 
inside. The tale of the "sublet from 
hell" has become a classic among 
stories about apartment disasters. But 
what most students don't know is that 
the building, which is finally being 
renovated this fall, belongs to Yale. 
The house on Edgewood is one of 
many Yale-owned buildings which do 
not appear on the University map in 
the 
Yale 
College . Programs 
of Study 
handbook. The .houses Yale owns on 
the east side of Mansfield Street, a 
quiet, tree-lined residential area, do 
not appear on that map either; neither 
do two newly rehabilitated brick apart-
ment buildings on Dixwell A venue. 


The University rents out more than 
570 apartments in nearby neighbor-
hoods, as well as the buildings used by 
various local businesses. 
Kinko's 
Copies and Phil's 
Hairstyles on 
Broadway, Naples R estaurant, the 
Daily Cam;, and Chapel Wines and 
Liquors are all Yale tenants. 
The infamous sublet is a rare case, 
the result of a student lessee's unusual 
choice of summer renters. Most people 
who live in Yale-owned houses are 
graduate students and faculty. But 
Yale's property extends far beyond the 
fortress-like heart of campus, to areas 
outside those which most students 
associate with the University. Yale 
holds the title to more land than 
anyone else in New Haven- 13 per-
cent of the city overall. This fact has 
brought the University into conflict 
with a variety of neighbors. 
"There's an old joke about Grove 
Street Cemetery," 
said 
Michael 
Morand, Democratic candidate for 
alderman in the Fir$t Ward, "that the 
dead shall be raised + when Yale wants 
the land." Tension over Yale's expan-
sion, and the use of its untaxed pro-
peny, tends to mount at times when 
the U niversity is making major new 
acquisition. Citizens, politicians, and 
administrators argue passionately over 
the issues that Yale's enormous 
property holdings bring up, including 
their tax-free status, their effect on the 
housing market in a city with hundreds 
of homeless people, and how Yale 
should invest in the city. 

Recently, the battle raged between 
residents of the HilJ neighborhood and 
university administrators over the 
Yale Psychiatric Institute. YPI, an 
inpatient hospital for emotionaUy dis· 
turbed young people, will move into a 
new building next month, next to 
Yale/New H aven Hospital in the Hill. 
University 
Secretary 
S h e il a 
Wellington called the YPI project "an 
excellent example of Yale colJaborating 
with the city." Alderwoman R obie 
Pooley, the R epublican mayoral can-
didate, called it "a disgrace." The 
negotiations over YPI exemplify the 
conflicts between New Haven and an 
expanding Yale.

Yale administrators said that YPI 
will benefit the community in ways not 
considered under the urban renewal 
law. WelJington suggested that YPI's 
research on mental illness 
might 
especially help poor people. "The 
incidence and prevalence of mental 
illness, and its severity, are worse as 
you go down the social ladder," she 
said. Paul Haeberle, executive director 
of YPI, pointed out that a separate 
branch of the institute, the Commu-
nity Service Division, already provides 
care for the poor. The branch runs 
programs including an 
outpatient 
hospital and vocational training, and 
helps patients find apartments.

In addition, YPI promised to build 
one storefront at street level, to make 
building 
less 
architecturally 
forbiddirlg, and to draw in members of 
the community. "The design of the 
building is to make it as non-insti· 
tutional as possible but also to be 
responsible to the neighborhood," said 
Lawrence Berger, YPI's deputy direc· 
tor of administration. More impor· 
tantly for city officials, the storefront 
means that part of the building will be 
taxed. 

YPI's move to the H ill caused an 
uproar because both the human and 
financial interests of New Haven are 
closely tied to the city's land. While 
citizens are 
concerned that Yale 
address the needs of their neighbor-
hoods when it moves in, city officials 
worry about losing property taxes as 
the University expands. 

Attaching a store to YPI is only a 
smaJI victory in New H aven's struggle 
to recapture some of its shrinking tax 
base. The city is riddled with nan· 
taxable land, including universities, 
churches, 
cemeteries , 
hospitals, 
schools, 
and 
municipal property. 
Altogether, almost a third of New 
Haven's assessed property value goes 
untaxed. Yale holds 38 percent of that 
land, far more than anyone else. 


**Title: Yale's Impact on New Haven**
**Page number(s): 24**

Since students are transient, always 
moving, Yale can't control the impact 
of student renters.


Since it is a non-profit organization, YPI does not pay taxes.  A couple with children might pay 40% of their income for an apartment.

an aide in the city's Fair Rent office, Yale avoids the public process of seeking zoning changes. In cases of major projects like YPI, because it doesn't want to raise citizens' hackles. "Half the city shows up for those hearings," he said, "people carrying signs saying 'Tax Yale' and 'Make Yale Pay,' and Yale doesn't like that kind of P.R."

The city seized its chance to stop Yale's expansion when, in 1965, the University tried to build a 13th residential college on the corner of Grove Street and Whitney Avenue. The University owned the land, but needed a variance to build a dormitory there. The Board of Aldermen thwarted Yale's plans by passing an ordinance saying Yale must seek the Board's permission for a variance. Yale challenged the ordinance in court, and the judge declared it unconstitutionaL By that time the University had abandoned the project. Ironically, 24 y.ears later, several alderpeople are angry at Yale for not providing more on-campus student housing. "It doesn't matter what they build or where they build, but they should build something," said Alderman Dick Lyons, of Ward 10. "Yale just doesn't address this problem at all." Although city officials object to the idea of Yale buying up land and taking it off the tax rolls, many also say that students in the New Haven housing market make a tough situation worse.

Yale administrators see the situation differently.. "If the University were miraculously able to provide on-campus housing for all of its students, a) we can't make people live in them, and b) an enormous amount of income that is going into the New Haven economy now wouldn't be there anymore," said Yale's Assistant Secretary Susan GodshalL Administrators point out that the University has made loans to organizations working to alleviate the housing crunch, and that Yale has considered investments in community housing projects. Last spring, Yale made a low-interest $1 million loan to Housing Operation Management Enterprise (HOME, Inc.), a nonprofit organization, to fund its affordable housing project. "There is no question that Yale is a powerful entity in this town, and as such has moral and ethical responsibilities to help the community," said Bob Solomon of HOME, Inc. He called the $1 million loan "a good start towards meeting those responsibilities." But not everyone shares Solomon's optimism. "The $1 million loan to HOME, Inc. was just barely below market lending rates, and Yale needs to be doing much more than that," said Reverend Carl Hilgert, an advocate for the homeless. Two years ago; President Benno Schmidt announced the New Haven Initiative, a commitment to invest $50 million in New Haven over the next ten years. The ~niversity invested the first $2 million of the initiative funds this year in Ninth Square Redevelopment, a project in a three-block section downtown. Joel Schiavone, a major New Haven developer and gubernatorial candidate, is still dissatisfied. "Yale has been conspicuously absent on any projects," he said. "They haven't even committed the interest on the $50 million." But counting the dollars invested in New Haven is an unfair way of assessing the University's service to the city, according to administrators. "There are many ways that Yale contributes to the New Haven area-obvious things like payroll and purchasing power, and participation on city boards and commissions," said GodshalL 

Furthermore, the University is looking after its internal interests. When considering investments, Yale's primary concern is to protect and to increase its $2.5 billion endowment. "It's not just a question of social policy," Godshall said. "We have to find investments that meet the standards of the overall investment project, but which happen to be in New Haven."
