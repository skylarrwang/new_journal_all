Along the corridors of the Yale 
Divinity School Chapel, rows of class 
pictures link one year of graduates to 
the next. Gary Hartpence, Class of 
1961 , appears in a small black and 
white photograph, an inconspicuous 
face among many. When the young 
Hartpence posed for that picture, he 
had no idea that he would gain renown 
as Gary Hart, Democratic senator 
from Colorado and candidate for 
President of the United States. YDS's 
idyllic campus appears an unlikely 
place for political action. In the quiet 
chapel, the intensity of politics seems 
far away. But throughout the Divinity 
School's history, the distinction 
between church and state has blurred, 
and today, politics still intertwines with 
the religious identity of the school. 


Primarily a Christian institution, 
the Divinity School trains women and 
men for the ministry. While approx-
imately 50 percent of its graduates go 
on to receive ordination, a small 
percentage views YDS as a stepping 
stone to political life. In addition to 
Hart, Republican Senator John C. 
Danforth graduated from YDS in 
1963, and Walter Fauntroy, Demo-
cratic congressman from the District of 
Columbia, earned his degree in 1958. 
YDS Professor Emeritus William Muehl 
served three terms as an alderman in 
the 18th Ward of New Haven from 
1963 to 1969, and Michael Morand, 
Democratic nominee for the position of 
First Ward alderman, began his first 
year at YDS this fall. 


The conjunction of churchly and 
civic duties is nothing new at Yale. 
Puritan ministers founded Yale Col-
lege in 1701 , stating in "An Act for 
Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" 
that 
they wanted an institution 
"wherein Youth may be instructed in 
the Arts and Sciences who through the 
blessing of Almighty God may be fitted 
for Publick employment in Church 
and Civil State." While Yale College 
has ceased to train students for the 
ministry, YDS continues Yale's earliest 
tradition. 


the YDS campus might surprise out-
siders. During the Presidential cam-
paign of 1988, joggers from Yale 
College saw posters for Pat Roberston 
plastered to dormitory doors and 
windows as they trotted through the 
Divinity School courtyard. The posters 
seemed to indicate a strong conser-
vative element on campus. But in fact, 
only one student ran the Robertson 
campaign, 
and he gathered little 
support from his classmates. Most 
YDS students described the campus as 
predominantly Democratic in the 1988 
election. Rusty Green, a third-year 
student who voted for Bush, recalls 
sermons led by his peers during the 
campaign. "It wasn't stated, but they 
were implying that the Christian thing 
to do was vote for Dukakis," Green 
said. 


The Divinity School can look back 
on a past more pointedly activist than 
the present. Danforth, in a lecture he 
gave at YDS three years ago, recalled 
his days as a student at the Divinity 
School in the early 1960s: 


With the recent associations between 
religion and Reagan-era conservatism, 
and with fundamentalist ministers like 
Jerry Falwell afoot, the liberalism of 
It was the heyday of the Civil Rights 
movement. One of the major con-
cerns of the time was segregation of 
Woolworth lunch counters in the 
South ... Seeking to bear witness to 
our faith, a number of us piled into a 
station wagon, with signs in the 
baggage area and made for the 
Woolworth store on State Street. I 
have a sharp memory of picketing 
the store with our chant "1, 2, 3, 4, 
don't go in the Woolworth store; 5, 
6, 
7, 
8, southern · Woolworths 
segregate." 


University Chaplain Harry Adams, 
Master of Trumbull College, recalls a 
YDS-organized procession to the New 
Haven Green in support of a black 
student who was denied admission to 
Vanderbilt University. Hart remem-
bers students traveling to Mississippi 
and Alabama during their summer 
vacations to help with voter regis-
tration. According to Adams, during 
the Vietnam War, Divinity School 
students were among those who turned 
in draft cards and marched in 
Washington. 


Today, the mood on campus is 
calmer, and students have turned from 
marches and protests to social service. 
Volunteers work for various organi-
zations: ·soup kitchens, 
Dixwell 
House, 
local 
hospitals , 
battered 
women's shelters, Planned Parent-
hood, and the Quinnipiac Housing 
Project. In a sense, the educational 
purpose of the school - training for the 
ministry- constitutes a call to com-
munity service. "People go into the 
ministry because they are interested in 
serving," said Letty Russell, professor 
of liberation theology. 


This interest in serving can extend 
beyond the confines of the church. 
'"The ministry is concerned with how 
the Christian commitment is lived out 
in the community of the world, and is 
acted out in the social and political 
arena," said Adams. 


Hart agrees. He follows the tradition 
begun by John Wesley, the 18th-
century British founder of Methodism, 
who focused on serving the needs of 
the "have-nots" in society. "Wesley 
didn't say join the Democratic Party or 
run for office, but he did say meet the 
needs of people on earth, and I was 
greatly influenced by that," said Hart. 


The Divinity School incorporates 
this commitment to social service into 
the curriculum through the "Super-
vised Ministry" requirement for the 
Master of Divinity degree. Students 
fulfill this requirement by working in a 
parish church or social service agency. 
Although more and more students are 
seeking placement in churches, only 
two years ago the high demand for 
positions in social service agencies 
made it difficult to meet all the 
requests. John Geter, President of the 
YDS student body, thinks the rising 
interest in church work indicates a new 
conservatism on campus. But Field 
Placement Coordinator Bernadette de 
Giulian insists that it is too soon to tell. 


Other areas of the YDS curriculum 
also embrace the social service ethic. 
Russell's courses in liberation theo-
logy emphasize a commitment to the 
church within the political world. In 
her advanced course, students read 
texts from a particular country and 
then spend some time in that country 
at the beginning of the spring se-
mester. Last year the class traveled to 
Mexico, and this year, Russell plans to 
take her students to South Africa. 


Since her courses are not required, 
students may make a political move 
simply by enrolling. "People think 
you're 
radical for taking liberation 
theology," Russell said. 
"People stand 
against the climate of the school in 
order to take my courses." 


Russell's courses are among a few 
that address issues outside of academic 
theology. 
Sister Shawn Copeland 
teaches a course on African-American 
theology, and Sister Margaret Farley 
teaches Ethics. "They really encourage 
students to integrate their studies with 
what is actually happening in New 
Haven and the rest of the world," said 
Ann Lutterman, a third-year student. 
"But many students say, 'Oh well, I've 
got to be ordained, and I don't have 
time to take frivolous courses like 
Liberation Theology.'" She added that 
faculty advisors have discouraged 
students from taking these courses, 
counseling that such a program would 
look bad on the students' records when 
applying for church jobs. 


Lutterman believes that such atti-

tudes 
reflect 
the current political 
climate at YDS, which she finds more 
apathetic than activist. "It's pseudo-
liberal, but not doing much," said 
Lutterman. For her, liberalism on 
campus means a tolerance of many 
ideas, not an active progressive force. 


"Sometimes it's like pulling teeth just to 
get people to do certain things," 
Lutterman said. While some students 
and faculty cite Central America as a 
concern in the YDS community, 
Lutterman is the only active worker 
from YDS in the New Haven chapter 
of Citizens in Solidarity with the 
People of El Salvador. 


The most vigorously debated poli-
tical issues on campus directly concern 
students' experience at the school. "The 
Divinity School is to some extent a city 
set on a hill," said Morand. While the 
hill may isolate students from external 
concerns, it also encourages them to 
turn inward, Daily sermons reveal that 
theology and politics are intimately 
connected, through what students refer 
to as "inclusive language." Students 
and faculty try to recognize and eli-
minate gender or racial prejudices in 
the religious language of the Bible and 
in their sermons. Using inclusive 
language means not referring to God 
as "He", changing 
references of 
"mankind" 
to "humankind", and 
increasing sensitivity to "racial 
overtones when invoking images of 
light and dark. "I think it really goes to 
the heart of life in the community," 
said Morand. "It's one of the ways in 
the school that political or social issues 
are being expressed, because it's some-
thing that affects everybody, and people 
are struggling through worship." 


Since inclusive language entails 
changing words in the Scriptures, 
some students resist it in the name of 
the sanctity of the Biblical word. "I 
would be against rewriting the Bible," 
said Green. 


Students face the issue of inclusive 
language in Chapel services every day, 
and no one on campus can avoid being 
exposed to it. "Inclusive language is the 
most visible thing, because there is a 
constant reminder as to whether people 
are using it or not," said Russell. A 
new crop of students encounter the 
concept every year. "I never experi-
enced an inclusive language worship 
service until I got here," said Susie 
Post, a second-year YDS student. 


The faculty and staff at YDS issued 
a 
statement encouraging but not 
mandating the use of inclusive lan-
guage in the mid-'70s. The statement, 
while symbolic, did little to 
resolve the issue; those who had been 
using inclusive language continued to 
do so, while those who opposed it did 
not start. "It pretty much established 
the lines where they were already 
drawn," said Geter. 


In students' careers, the discussion 
of inclusive language may ultimately 
prove moot. Many parishes do not 
accept such language in their sermons 
and some students on supervised mini-
stry assignments have been criticized 
for using it. Although Post, after two 
years at YDS, now advocates the use of 
inclusive language, -she plans to enter 
the Episcopal Church ministry, which 
does 
not 
allow the language of 
inclusion in its sermons. 


While inclusive language constantly 
receives attention on campus, some 
students dismiss it as trivial. Still, those 
who feel excluded by standard ecclesi-
astical terms care deeply about the 
issue. "We recognize it's not trivial 
because of the power of language to 
determine 
social structures," said 
Sandy Sorensen, a third-year student 
at YDS. For many of the 165 women 
in the YDS student body, the social 
structure of the church is of particular 
concern. "I think that whether every-
one recognizes it or not, there's still a 
lot of resistance to women in the 
church," said Sorensen. 


Some churches still do not ordain 
women as ministers. Michelle Bashi, a 
second-year student and co-coor-
dinator of the YDS Women's Center, 
is a Roman Catholic, and as a woman, 
cannot serve as a priest. Bashi does not 
want to challenge this aspect of the 
church structure. "Most Roman 
Catholic women feel it's not a battle 
worth putting our energy into because 
we don't feel we would have an 
impact," she said. In denominations 
which do ordain women, worries re-
main about how women are accepted 
in the parishes. "Even if ordination per 
se isn't an issue, there is still a lot of
