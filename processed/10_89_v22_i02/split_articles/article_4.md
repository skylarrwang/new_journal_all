The Art of Pool

It is just past midnight and I have four more books of The Republic to read. My roommate, who is on the first page of a five-page paper due tomorrow, slowly turns his head from the monitor and looks over at the pool cue he bought last week. Its two unscrewed segments rest in a corner of the common room. I look over at Blake, and our eyes meet in an admission of defeat. Blake moves with a steady determination towards the corner of the room, raises both parts of the cue, and screws them together. The next thing I know, Blake is circling the table looking for a shot. He pauses and bends over until his eyes are level with the table. With his left hand, he forms a bridge and with his right hand pulls the cue back. In a locked pool room in the basement of Saybrook College, I am finally at peace.


Torn between the demands of my classes and the lure of the pool table in the Saybrook basement, I take some comfort in knowing that I am not alone in my billiard angst. No matter what time of day or night, there is always a wait for the college tables. In fact, pool at Yale has become so popular that one shark has made a proposal to the college athletic secretaries to make it an intramural sport.


I first realized the significance of pool one memorable night last year. I had put aside a little free time and so psyched myself up to play. As my key turned in the pool room door, I heard "Love on the Rocks" drifting out of a radio on the other side. By the time I was inside the pool room, I realized that there was someone I didn't know listening to a Neil Diamond cassette, scanning the table for a shot, and singing along with Diamond-esque scruffiness. "First they say they want you, then they say ... Hey, do you want to play?" he asked.


Under any other circumstances, I would have politely (or perhaps impolitely) excused myself and escaped as fast as I could. But seeing the cue in his hand and the balls on the table, I realized that we shared a passion. We played for about an hour. The green felt of the pool table had been our common ground. After this encounter, I knew this game was powerful stuff.


All of the colleges at Yale, except Trumbull, have one or two pool tables. The tables are either in the college basements, or at least in rooms that have the atmosphere of a dungeon. Saybrook's room is a case in point. I've heard one player refer to the set-up there as a "God-awful table, in a God-awful room." The felt on the table is rubbed off so that the layer of slate underneath has shown through. The bumpers are warped and some of the balls are chipped. The carpet under the table is as rubbed down as the felt. Several cockroaches have made this orange carpet their final resting place. The underground room always seems cold and damp, and the small windows don't let in any natural light.


While the majority of pool rooms on campus look and feel like Saybrook's, there are notable exceptions. Jonathan Edwards' pool room reflectsÂ· the trend toward yuppification epitomized by upscale pool clubs like "Society Billiards" on 21st Street in Manhattan. "Society Billiards" charges twelve bucks for an hour of pool in a well-lit room lined with murals and mirrors, while upstairs, in a neon dance club called "Cafe Society," investment bankers flirt over expensive Italian dishes. In JE there are no gin and tonics nor does the Buttery rival "Cafe Society." Nonetheless, its electric blue walls and reggae music give the JE pool room a veneer of hipness and newness. Say goodbye to any hint of green swinging billiard lamps and wood grain paneling if you want to play atJE.


Supposedly, the most "authentic" (see my discussion of pool and the sleaze factor) place to play on campus is the GPCSY. The GPCSY has two tables set up in its smoky back room. Tradition dictates that the loser of each game has to pay fifty cents to stay on the table. Allegedly, some old guy even guards the GPSCY tables scouting out hustlers and warning the regulars.


At the start of each game, one player takes striped balls and solid balls of many colors and in a symbolic gesture molds them into an equilateral triangle. This is called "racking 'em up." Like the rack that shapes the balls into an ideal geometric shape, a game of pool brings together all sorts of people. Yale's diverse pool rooms provide a place where Lit majors clad in black can commune with their Group IV brothers and sisters, who are otherwise tucked away in labs atop "the hill."


In a sense, playing pool is a metaphor for the benificence of the natural order. A good game of pool can put people in touch with the workings of the world around them. It counteracts the feeling of detachment that often results from unrelenting academic pursuits. The 18th-century British philosopher David Hume seemed to lose sight of reality in his obsessive search for an a priori justification for causation. Note his thoughts on pool:


When I see, for instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause? May not both these balls remain at absolute rest? May not the first ball return in a straight line, or leap off from the second in any line or direction? All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable.


When I first encountered Hume's ideas last year, I was frightened. I was sitting in a lecture hall and there was no pool table handy to test the veracity of this passage. The world began to dissolve into chaos. I imagined that there was no sense in nature. I had no reason to assume that nightfall would come. If
