Some Pig

Writing an average of fifty pages each
semester leaves budget-conscious
Yalies with two options: swipe or
charge. 

They can
sneak out of
Connecticut Hall with
three-inch
stacks of computer paper hidden under
their jackets, or they can pay for it with
plastic at the Co-op. Both possibilities
unnecessarily deplete the North Amer-
ican environment. Wilbur's Recycled
Paper Products, a fledgling business
with a mission, now offers an alter-
native to petty ~ievery and expensive
Co-op prices.

Neal Garcia Latt (TD '89), a second-
semester senior, created Wilbur's with
two goals in mind:
to distribute
recycled paper products at affordable
prices and to educate the Yale com-
munity. To increase environmental
awareness, Latt pl~ns to insert a fact
sheet outlining the benefits of using
recycled paper in every order he receives.

If Latt sells two tons of recycled
paper-100 cartons - Yale students
will save 17 trees and enough energy to
power the average home for one year
(8,200 kwh). Using 100 cartons of
recycled paper will
also conserve
14,000 gallons of water and prevent
the emission of 120 pounds of pollu-
tants. Two tons of recycled paper
would eliminate six cubic yards of New
Haven's landfill,
relief that New
Haven and the state of Connecticut
sorely need.

Latt calls his enterprise a "business
that gives a
no-bullshit deal- an
ec?ologically sound product at a low
Prtce." He said he named his company
after Wilbur, the benevolent pig in
E.B. White's Charlotte's Web, since ~e
envisioned Wilbur's as a benevolent
business. This fall , posters (printed on
rec;ycled paper, of course) announced
Wilbur's intention to provide cheap
recycled paper.

The first shipment of recycled
products stamped with the Wilbur logo
consisted of computer paper, several
grades of xerographic and white bond
Neal Latt's Wilbur may start a new recycling trend.
paper, and envelopes. Wilbur's also
stocks some higher quality recycled
papers, such as French Linen Text and
Halopaque Offset. The best deal for
students, Latt said, is the 2,500-sheet
carton of computer paper for $35
which, split among a suite of four,
should last an entire academic year. At
the Co-op a carton this size would cost
more than $42.

To set up Wilbur's, Latt had to lo-
cate a recycled paper mill and find a
source of funds.
Latt found
a
paper company based in San Fran-
cisco that has branches on the East
Coast. He used money from Yale
Recyclers- the student group that
oversees
Yale's current recy-
cling program- to buy his first 100
cartons of paper. All the money
Wilbur makes from sales goes back
into the company.

Latt
has
approached
the
administration
directly
to boost
Wilbur's sales and Yale's committment
to recycling. To capture the office
market, he plans to attach his flyer to
the forms that offices must fill out to
order paper from Central Receiving,
Yale's paper supplier. Despite some
hesitancy on
the part of Central
Receiving, the administration has moved
toward a more extensive recychng
program. Director of Facilities Alan
Braun has approved a pilot project in
SSS Hall. Each office in the building will
have several bins for sorting trash.
Custodians will take the sorted trash
out of the building, and maintenance
workers will convey it to a recycling
dumpster. "This is the first time Yale is
getting on the ball instead of passing
the buck," Latt said.

Latt hopes he can hook up Braun
and the company he buys from, as a
first step toward converting Yale to
recycled
paper. Although Wilbur
would
not
profit
from
this
arrangement, Latt said, "Wilbur's goal
is
self-sustenance,
but Â·
dissemination of recycling."

Wilbur's seems headed for financial
success anyway. Latt sold half of the
first shipment before it even arrived,
and has been receiving phone calls for
more orders constantly. Latt decen-
tralized his company to deal with
Wilbur's
popularity.
Now
each
residential college has its very own
Wilbur's representative to take orders
from students, to receive the paper
from Wilbur's truck, and to deliver to
the customers in the college. Before
graduating in December, Latt hopes to
sell recycled paper to at least four
percent of the Yale community and to
. pass Wilbur's reins to a new manager
who will expand the market.

Latt hopes that by offering inexpen-
sive paper and the convenience of free
delivery, Wilbur's will inspire the Yale
community to invest more in recycled-
paper products. On October 20,
recyclers and environmentalists
plan to rally on Beinecke Plaza to
pressure the administration to adopt a
university-wide recycling program.
State law dictates that by 1991 New
Haven must recycle 25 percent of all
solid wastes. Perhaps Latt's efforts,
reinforced with state legislation, will
lead Yale to mandate recycling. In the
meantime, however, at least Wilbur's
may keep
the thieves out of
Connecticut H all.
