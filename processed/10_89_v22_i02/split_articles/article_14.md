her duties as a college dean, the 
administration hired the first full-time, 
paid director who will work in the 
office. But members of EASY were 
disappointed that the administration 
passed over two applicants who met 
the student group's 
qualifications, 
including a disabilities organizer from 
Harvard. 

Faye Hanson, the new Resource 
Office director, has little 
formal 
training in working with disabilities, 
but said raising a daughter who is 
learning disabled has made her sen-
sitive to the issues important to her 
job. "I know about that whole business 
of being labeled and struggling for 
independence," she said. Hanson has a 
master's degree in sociology, and 
worked for ten years as an admini-
strator at the Medical School. The 
Resource Office's third manager in five 
years, she said she is making a fresh 
beginning. "I view it as a start-up 
project, one that will be develop-
mental," Hanson said. Although the 
Resource Office has just hired a part-
time secretary, Hanson said she needs 
fuU-time help. "fm finding it's an 
enormous job," she said. "The phones 
ring all day." 

Hanson's job is not much different 
from that of the former assistant 
director in that she is supposed to co-
ordinate services for students, rather 
than make recommendations to the 
administration. "It is our hope that 
having a director to do more of the 
day-to-day tasks, it will be possible to 
let the committee address issues of 
policy," Long said. Students argue that 
the University should give the 
Resource Office director more power 
to act as their advocate 
to the 
University. 

Weed was frustrated because Hanson, 
although she supported him in his battle 
over crossing the street, could do little to 
resolve the situation. "She should be an 
advocate, 
but in 
a 
pre-organized 
environment,• Weed said. •As it is it's 
very disorganized." Hanson agreed that 
the office needs to keep track of students' 
disabilities, but, she said, *Each person's 
needs are very different. You can't 
~trapolate that ·of one to another." 

She characterized the debate over 
Weed as a matter of opinion. "We all 
have our own biases," she said. "He 
put up a good fight." Trachtenberg 
maintains that working with disabled 
students on a flexible and informal 
basis makes sense. " I don't think any 
student here is in the province of one 
office," she said. "It's a decentralized 
place, and lots of people are in on 
decisions." 

While Hanson deals directly with 
students, the Advisory Committee 
plans to discuss how the University 
should address questions of disabilities 
in general. Aware of the hostilities of 
last year, Savage wants to build com-
munication with students by matching 
them with members of the committee. 
"The idea is to take the fifty-odd 
students who are our clients and divide 
them into groups of four, assigning 
them to committee members," he 
said. 

Meanwhile, EASY members are 
continuing to work out their own 
agenda. They have created subcom-
mittees to study the issues of the 
medical examination policy, accessi-
bility to buildings, and hiring a 
disabled staff person for the Resource 
Office. Brooks said that as long as the 
number of disabled students is so low, 
they will continue to deal with their 
concerns little by little. "It's not easy to 
be disabled at Yale," she said. "There 
are so many issues, and so few of us."
