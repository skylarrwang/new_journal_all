included messages of congratulations for 
those who had been employed at the factory 
for 50 years or more. 


These factory-sponsored activities all 
took place at a time when the nation was 
fully mobilized for war, and many of those 
working in the factory received exemptions 
from service because they had special skills 
in a vital war industry. Factory workers 
developed the kind of loyalty towards 
Winchester that servicemen held for their 
branch of the military. A fraternal 
camaraderie arose that made Winchester a 
strong firm with a reputation for a qualiry 
product. 


The family atmosphere and undying 
employee loyalty proved invaluable when 
the company tried to push its production 
capacity in WWII. For today's Winchester, 
these intangibles ace elusive goals, but goals 
towards which it has made great strides as it 
modernizes its facilities. 


Winchester breaks its plans for future 
progress into phases. Planning for Phase 
Two includes a complete relocation from the 
old factory into the new plant. The physical 
move reveals an optimism on the pare of 
Winchester. It foresees continuing success in 
the sporting-arms market. Thus far, results 
have been very encouraging. Production 
increased by 20,000 rifles from 1992 to 
1993, and this year, production will exceed 
270,000 rifles. The management aims to 
turn out nearly twice as many by the year 
2000. 


But the West was won long ago. 
Winchester wiJI never again play a major 
role in global affairs the way it did in the 
World Wacs. It must prevent the layoffs and 
union disputes and maintain the qualiry of 
its product. Still, the new factory gleams 
beside its decaying predecessors. Inside, the 
eight-foot tall statue of John Wayne is more 
than a memorial. It has grown slightly 
tarnished over the years, but, for now, the 
legend lives on.
