hopes to reach a wider audience through a 
dramatization of the story, without 
sacrificing artistic or factual integrity. 
Documentary filmmaker Errol Morris, 
whose movie The Thin Blue Line helped get 
an innocent man off death row, has agreed to 
attach his name to the project. The Spielberg 
people expressed interest in making a movie 
about the movie, but Ondi wants to keep the 
focus on Bonnie. At present she and her 
agent are negotiating with ABC and CBS 
over a Movie of the Week, which wnÂ· ~!~ 
reach 6 to 7 million viewers. Queen Lacifah 
and Oprah Winfrey reportedly have their 
eyes on the role of Bonnie. 

Neither Ondi nor Bonnie seems very 
concerned about the relative benefit each of 
them has derived from the film. Both reason 
that the further Ondi goes, the better chance 
she'll have to help Bonnie. Bonnie predicts 
that Ondi will be famous. Says Ondi, "Our 
goals have been aligned from the start. I 
won't stop until she's out." 

Bonnie is optimistic about the film's 
direct impact on her suit. "I don't know what 
they [state prosecutors and police officers) 
thought those interviews were for, but they 
made incriminating statements on camera. 
Every word you say can and will be held 
against you." 

In the eyes of Bonnie and her advocates, 
the courts have already failed every test of 
their fairness to a single woman without 
private representation or access to power. 
The attention and backing she has finally 
received are at once a credit to her own 
perseverance and a grim indictment of what 
really makes the legal system tick. In the 
words of Steve Kurnnick, the Hartford police 
detective who first interrogated Bonnie, ''I'm 
not a mind-reader. If I don't have to do 
something, I may not do it. It's the nature of 
the beast." 

Ondi didn't have to do anything for 
Bonnie, nor did anyone else. But they have. 
Perhaps under their combined pressure, the 
courts will have to do something, too. li1J
