mystery. (What, after all, does the average 
undergrad know about his TA? That she 
lives somewhere within rhe New Haven area 
code, and chat she occasionally has office 
hours, though he's nor sure just when or 
where). Satchels also go very well with black. 
Backpacks, on the other hand, are more 
casual, utilitarian, and not unsuited to 
flannel shirts. They don't suggest much 
more than youth and perhaps sportiness; 
certainly they say nothing in particular 
about the nature of one's studies. 
Unfortunately, the once-dear distinction 
berween students has been blurring, and it is 
not because graduate students have heard 
rhe gospel of Jansport. Rather, increasing 
numbers of undergraduates are leaving their 
Eddie Bauer standbys_ at home with their 
unreturned high school textbooks and their 
old Esprit bookbags. It is now possible ro 
wander through Willoughby's and find 
satchel-sporting students waving their hands 
over their double-tall, non-fat lattes as they 
discuss the horrors of English 129 papers-
meaning the writing rather than the grading. 
I have no serious complaints to lodge 
with chose undergraduates who have 
adopted satchels as their own. It's a certain 
sartorial statement, after all, and as I am 
unlikely co mistake a random sophomore for 
my philosophy TA based simply upon her 
book-carrying apparatus, it's even a fairly 
harmless one. Nevertheless, it's difficult not 
ro notice char certain undergraduates are 
more fond of such statements-not to 
mention more willing to throw rheir 
shoulders out of alignment-chan are 
others. 

Undergraduate satchel carriers choose 
their bags co make a statemenr, to assert 
their independence from the knapsack 
mafia, and to express their own deeply-held 
sense of purpose. Many are headed to grad 
school in the I iberal arts, and thus are 
declaring either the seriousness of their 
purpose or their solidarity with their TA's. 
Some may have returned from a year abroad 
(usually in Europe), while others simply see 
themselves as somehow differenr: trendier, 
more suave, and utterly unafraid to walk 
wirh a distinct rightward lise. Satchels do 
look conveniently like briefcases, when seen

from a distance, and 
may, for this reason, 
attract 
the 
pre-
professional 
crowd. 
However, ir is theater, 
comp lit, and foreign 
language majors who . 
seem most partial to 
// 
satchels; I'll leave it co you 
ro decide just why this should 
be so. 
And indeed, should you 
decide to become a satchel-
spotter yourself, an array of 
other trends and subcategories 
will no doubt suggest themselves-the 
critical divide between leather and nylon 
satchels, rhe ambiguous case of the 
backpack worn on one shoulder-bur 
those issues bear more serious scrutiny than 
this brief introduction can provide. So good 
luck, and happy theorizing.

anything that could be described as even 
remotely satchei-like-unlen you count the 
abovementioned Esprit bags, of which she 
owned three.)
