EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
only an 8mm hand-held camcorder and the 
essential facts of Bonnie's case, they had to 
learn as Â·they went, both about the intricacies 
of the case and about the art of film-making. 
Bonnie's brother, a Miami police officer, 
provided them with many leads on the legal 
details of the case. And the interviews with 
her parents offered suggestive glimpses of her 
childhood home. Through skillful editing 
these fuzzy, backlit takes were later 
incorporated into one of the film's grimly 
ironic moments: 
"No," laughs her mother, "he never 
touched her. He'd run away before he'd beat 
any of them." 
"When she confronted him about it," 
says Bonnie in her cell, "he adamantly 
denied it and started beating me and her." 
Cut to the stepfather: "I didn't put my 
... 
hands on her, on account of she wasn't my 
daughter, you understand? You can't put 
your hands on nobody else's children." 

Back in New Haven, Ondi began to see 
that it would take the whole summer 
and a mountain of investigative work 
to do the film right. She and David 
marshaled the forces of several friends to help 
with research and production. One of the 
principals was Peter Conolly-Smith (GRD 
'95), an American studies graduate student 
whose zealous involvement with the 
production put him months behind on his 
dissertation. Another central figure was 
Graham Brownstein (PC '96), research 
coordinator, who doubled as Ondi's 
boyfriend-"the hardest job of all," 
according to David. 

Everyone held day jobs to pay the rent in 
New Haven, rushing home to work on the 
film until four each morning. Ondi's 
obsession with the film caused her to lose an 
office job in New Haven and give up an 
internship with PBS in New York; she had 
better luck as a nude model and a 2-WALK 
guard. Short on time and shorter on 
funding, she criss-crossed the state with a 
borrowed camera to interview everyone she 
could find from the case. Her subjects 
included police officers, lawyers for the 
defense and the prosecution, a representative 
of the Connecticut Right to Life 
Corporation, plus a number of expert 
witnesses on domestic violence and 
constitutional law. A research team of about 
ten people met weekly in Ondi's and 
Graham's living room to share their findings. 

The researchers found ample evidence of 
the political uproar over the death of Amos' 
fetus. Bonnie was the first person to have 
killed a pregnant woman in the state of-
Connecticut, and state chapters of the Right 
to Life Corporation, the Pro-Life Council, 
and the Catholic Conference seized on the 
case as an opportunity to establish the legal 
status of a fetus as a human being. They 
dubbed the fetus "Baby Boy Amos," and the 
local media followed suit. Superior Court 
Judge Herbert Barall ruled that Connecticut 
general statutes defining murder did not 
apply to viable fetuses-a decision which Bill 
O'Brien, Connecticut Right to Life director, 
refers to in the film as a declaration of "open 
season on the unborn." 

The pro-life lobby and state Republican 
leadership pushed successfully for a hearing 
on "feticide legislation." In the end the 
legislature decided not to recognize a fetus as 
a human being, acting instead on the advice 
of John J. Kelley, chief state's attorney, who 
recommended circumventing the abortion 
issue by simply "enhancing penalties" for 
violent crimes against pregnant women. The 
maximum sentence for manslaughter in 
Connecticut is 20 years, though prisoners 
with good behavior usually serve less than 
half of the term. Women convicted of 
murder (a felony, and therefore not subject 
to parole) frequently receive sentences of 
fewer than 20 years. The legislative changes 
Kelley recommended prompted the 
prosecutor's decision to raise the charge 
against Bonnie from manslaughter to murder 
and the judge's unheard-of sentence of 45 
years. 

"Bonnie suffered so much from negative 
publicity around her trial," Ondi told me. "I 
wanted the film to give her as much honest 
publicity as possible before her appeal is 
heard." While not seeking to exonerate her, 
the film argues persuasively that Bonnie's 
crime was not murder but manslaughter, for 
which she has already served more than 
enough time. The film grants Bonnie a 
retrial in which she is allowed to argue her 
own defense, and the legal system is called to 
the stand for some hard questioning. 

Bonnie's on-camera testimony 
constitutes the backbone of the film's 
narration. Her interview segments are 
interspersed with statements from the 
various experts, character witnesses, and 
officials involved in the case. Ondi compares 
the film's structure to a prism: "I wanted to 
depict the case through a multitude of 
perspectives without any single, overriding 
voice so that the viewer would feel like a 
member of the jury." 

Against a background of prison 
cinderblock, Bonnie describes the 
interrogation immediately following her 
arrest. Police pressured her for seven to eight 
hours to make a statement, she says, and 
denied her requests to call an attorney until 
minutes before her arraignment. In the next 
sequence Yale political science professor 
Rogers Smith, surrounded by books, explains 
that the law requires that all questioning 
cease once a suspect requests an attorney. 
The film cuts to Steve Kumnick, the police 
detective who interrogated Bonnie: "It's an 
adversarial relationship. She's the suspect, 
and I'm interrogating her. I'm not going to 
make her a five-course breakfast." 

Before and throughout her trial, Bonnie 
tells us, she was administered a drug she later 
learned was Thorazine, an anti-depressant 
used for treating psychotics. In the next shot, 
Donald Grayson, a psychiatrist involved in 
the case, says he can't imagine why Bonnie 
was given Thorazine, since she has no history 
of psychosis. But upon reflection, he 
mentions that many of the prisoners he sees 
as patients seem to be under the influence of 
heavy mood-altering drugs. Whatever it was, 
adds Bonnie's daughter Sylvia Green, "it 
made her like a zombie," jeopardizing her 
credibility in the eyes of the jury. 

Throughout the five-day trial, Bonnie 
continues, anti-abortion demonstrators 
picketed the courthouse. The film 
incorporates clips from heavily slanted local 
news coverage of the "Baby Boy Amos" story. 
Bonnie's request to move the trial was 
denied. According to Bonnie, her court-
appointed public defender Dennis O'Toole 
seemed uninterested, even hostile, and asked 
her very few questions. She remembers 
saying to him, "'It's obvious you're not 
interested in defending me. Why don't you 
give up my case?' And from then on he never 
even pretended." 

The court denied Bonnie's request for a 
new defender, a decision Rogers Smith 
confirms violated her right to counsel as 
guaranteed by the Constitution. 

O'Toole refused to be interviewed for the 
film, but trial records and the filmed 
recollections of other lawyers bear out 
Bonnie's claims. The defense attorney failed 
to subpoena any character witnesses to testify 
to Bonnie's ten years of work at the 
Wiremold Company, her service as a union 
shop steward for Local 1040, or her single-
handed support of two children and the 
home she owned in Bloomfield. Ondi 
compensates for O'Toole's negligence by 
interviewing Bonnie's two adult children, her 
neighbors, and a co-worker, among others. 
But by far the strongest defense of her 
character is Bonnie's own gentle intelligence, 
guiding viewers through the film. 

The only witness called by the defense 
was a psychiatrist named Anne Price, who 
had concluded after a single 15-minute 
session that Bonnie suffered from Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a 
syndrome afflicting many victims of 
domestic abuse as well as combat veterans. 
One of the symptoms of PTSD, the harried-
looking Price told Ondi, is hyper-vigilance, 
or a tendency to respond in disproportionate 
ways to perceived threats. But when she 
attempted to hand literature about PTSD to 
the judge, she recalls, he dismissed it as 
irrelevant. Connecticut statutes softening 
penalties for battered women did not apply 
to Bonnie, since neither her victim nor her 
assailant was her batterer. 

John Williams, Bonnie's present lawyer, 
criticizes O'Toole's failure to present an 
orchestrated argument about PTSD, a 
relatively unfamiliar term at the time. Cross-
examination quickly revealed that Price had 
not been prepared as an expert witness. The 
defense offered no medical or police records 
as proof of Bonnie's history of abuse, nor did 
O'Toole call Bonnie's children to the stand. 
"If you want to present a Beethoven 
symphony," says Williams, "you don't send 
in some guy to whistle." 

The film makes much of the issue of 
PTSD and the law's treatment of battered 
women. In addition to interviews confirming 
Bonnie's stories of abuse and persecution, 
Ondi included commentary from Evan 
Stark, a legal expert on domestic abuse, and 
government statistics on domestic violence. 
This kind of information and expert 
testimony, Williams told me, is exactly what 
ought to be brought up in the courtroom. 
"Ondi is a brilliant, politically astute artist," 
he says. "She assembled my case for me." 

Perhaps most astonishingly, the defense 
made no mention of the criminal record of 
Hector Freeman, Bonnie's assailant. He had 
been arrested three times for assault, once on 
a police officer. In fact, O'Toole did not 
know that Freeman had a record until he had 
left the stand, nor did he recall him once he 
was informed. 

In order to establish murderous intent, 
the prosecution brought in witnesses who 
claimed to have heard Bonnie arguing with 
Freeman or with Amos in the bar. While the 
accounts conflicted, the state rested its case 
on the testimony of one James Pugh, who 
claimed to have heard Bonnie say to Amos, 
"Bitch, I'm tired of your shit." In the 
probable cause hearing, however, Pugh had 
testified that he had not heard Bonnie say 
anything. The film drives home this 
inconsistency with copies of the transcripts 
of his two testimonies. 

Based on Pugh's testimony, prosecutor 
Thomas asserted that Bonnie's self-defense 
story was a pure fabrication. The shooting, 
he argued, was premeditated. In the end, the 
jury agreed. 

Thomas is one of the film's cast of black 
hats, whose interviews are impressively 
revealing. "Why did they agree to 
interview?" muses Ondi. "The truth was not 
on their side. I think they agreed because 
they were afraid of looking scared. They're 
not bad people. They're just doing their jobs. 
That's the problem: they're just doing their 
jobs." 

When Ondi interviewed Richard 
Emmanuel, Bonnie's public defender in her 
appeal, he cautiously declined to comment 
on the performance of fellow public defender 
O'Toole. "Let me say this," he conceded, 
"undeniably this was a manslaughter case, 
and not a murder case." 

Once in prison, Bonnie slipped 
through every conceivable crack in 
the legal system. She was assigned a 
succession of seven public defenders, none of 
whom managed even to file an appeal for 
her. Bonnie began studying state laws in the 
prison library and was drafting her own 
appeal, when she received a visit from Mary 
Werblin, a private defense lawyer who had 
learned about the case from counselors at 
Niantic. Werblin brought the case to the 
attention of a local philanthropist who 
agreed to donate $10,000 toward the cost of 
hiring a lawyer for Bonnie. 

They hired John Williams, who had cut 
his legal teeth defending the Black Panthers 
in the early 70s and today ranks among the 
most respected defense lawyers in the state. 
His work, which normally costs clients $300 
an hour, has been largely pro bono. Filmed 
in front of an antique American flag, he 
embodies a sense of embattled constitutional 
ideals. His closing remarks voice the moral 
message at the heart of the film: 
"Obviously this is not a just result. The 
test of the ability of our system to do justice 
to Bonnie Foreshaw is, I think, a test of our 
commitment to the concept of justice in 
general. Are we big enough, is our system 
strong enough, to admit this error, attempt 
to rectify it, and go on? We will find out. I 
hope it is, because if it isn't, that doesn't say 
very much that's promising for the rest of us. 
If it can happen to Bonnie Foreshaw, it can 
happen to others, and will." 

Editing of The Nature of the Beast lasted 
well into the fall 1994 semester, and 
negotiations with distributors 
continue. A screening at Yale in October was 
greeted by a large, receptive audience and 
positive reviews. It has since aired on 
Connecticut and Florida public television, 
and an excerpted version is scheduled to run 
on a New York City independent film 
channel in April. A deal is underway to 
distribute the film to law schools and 
women's studies programs around the 
country. 

After finishing the film, Ondi was hired 
to work on Steven Spielberg's Holocaust oral 
history project, Survivors of the Shoah. She 
has moved to Los Angeles, but her 
involvement with Bonnie and her case 
continue. Each woman describes the other as 
"a member of my family." Bonnie has signed 
the rights to her life story over to Ondi. 
Ondi's time in Los Angeles has provided 
her and the film with welcome public 
exposure. Before Bonnie's suit is heard, Ondi
