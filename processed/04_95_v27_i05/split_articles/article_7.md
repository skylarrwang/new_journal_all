EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"Now is the winter of our discontent," declares Shakespeare's Richard III, utterly 
unaware that these lines would ring so true in contemporary New Haven. The line plays 
on its double meaning; read straight on, it sounds as if winter marks a rime of di'sconrenc. 
But upon closer scrutiny, the line promises the end of discontent. Now in April, we 
embrace the end of winter's bitter cold-our discontent. New Haven's climatic 
unpredictability notwithstanding, we've shed our scarves and wool gloves for the most 
part. But just as Shakespeare's line hovers in ambivalence, so do we, as we hold rhe jacket 
in a moment of indecision, tentatively fearing the cold that's wont ro bite back in a 
resurgence of winter. Anxious for a break, we gaze longingly at ou!"'shorts and t-shirrs, 
envious of those courageous few who have already donned them. Stir-crazy from months 
indoprs? Perhaps. But maybe our discontent stems from something more than the 
temperature. In spite of Yale's reputation for apathy and New Haven's for despair, rhe past 
few months and weeks have wirnessed a stirring of polirical senriment-and agirarion-
over what many liberals would call ruin and conservatives would call renewal. In spire of a 
hostile political climate, acrivisrs have overcome despair, fueled by discontent ro prorest 
and enact change. The Contract with America, California's Proposirion 187, and GESO's 
call for unionizarion have sparked fervenr debare, rife wirh a potenr mix of jargon and 
pure sentiment. Srudents and residents have galvanized ro protect what rhey call "jusrice," 
"rights," "opporrunity." Coming our of a winter ofharsh polirical forecasts, rhese acrivisrs 
brave the caprice of the New Haven spring and march across Cross Campus lawn, rally 
around City Hall. From a harsh and cold winter springs forth dialogue but not a lirrle 
diatribe. 

This issue's cover story harkens back to the 1970s when a group of New Haveners 
dedicated to raising political consciousness, founded a newspaper called the Modern Times. 
Written by Ben Lumpkin, rhe piece chronicles the lives of the paper and its people-those 
who ran it and those profiled in it. The Modern Times commitred itself ro letting voices be 
heard that would not otherwise be heard, voices speaking about urban redevelopment, 
environmental reform, social injustice. Although the paper was published 20 years ago, it 
addresses many of the same issues confronring New Haven roday. Rosemary Hutzler writes 
about Bonnie Jean Foreshaw, convicted of murder and sentenced ro 45 years in prison-
the longest sentence delivered to a woman in Connecticut. The srory relates whar 
happened when Bonnie met Yalie Ondi Timoner (SY '94). Together rhe rwo women have 
worked to serve justice rhrough film, after the court sysrem failed rhem. While the 
Consriturion makes promises, the courrs offer no such guaramees. By the same roken, rhe 
rift between academic ideals and their implementation can be vast. Joel Burges' piece on 
Americanist literary scholars reveals the fissure in academia between intellectual ideals of 
diversity and the troubled task of realizing these goals. 

Action takes myriad forms. Dan Seiler writes about the I Have a Dream program 
which selected a group of East Rock Community School fourth-graders to pay for their 
college or vocational school tuitions, looking for promise in the future. The prayer group 
led by New Haven resident Jere Garceau puts its hopes into the Yalies of roday. They pray 
for each freshperson class, targeting Yale because this is the place where furure leaders are 
born. Sound far-fetched? Maybe. 

The content of these anicles as well as a few changes in our design attempr to open up 
the lines of dialogue and articulate more than what is on the surface.
