I am one of the guilty ones. In my 
closet hang seven Patagonia jackets. An 
eighth, a synchilla vest, size S, blueberry, is 
on its way via UPS. I don Gore-Tex at the 
most innocuous drizzle, and two of me 
could fit inside my strap-laden backpack. 
My all-leather Vasque hiking boots, 
scuffed and softened, give me about 
as much support as a bedroom 
slipper, though I've only really hiked 
in them five times. You know how 
treacherous New Haven sidewalks 
can be. 

For the most part, Yalies who 
dress in fleece and puffy vests have 
some kind of American West hangup, 
myself included. Somewhere behind 
every earflap hat wearer there's a 
summer in Jackson Hole or a ski 
vacation in Telluride; a friend who 
did what one wished one could have 
and went to college at Boulder; or a 
brother who makes his living white 
water rafting in Utah. Remember 
that course you took whose syllabus 
included Black Elk and Frederick 
Jackson Turner? It's no accident that 
Guide Shells were strewn across the 
backs of 90 percent of the chairs in 
the lecture hall. Forget about noble 
savages, covered wagons, cowboys, 
and silver mining. At Yale, we've co-
opted mountaineering clothing as 
our own particular piece of the 
frontier myth. 

Trailblazer, on Elm Street, caters to our 
fancy- "fancy" meaning just that ... It's no 
big surprise when a flannel clad salesman 
explains to me that it's "fashion before 
functionality" when it comes to the 
Patagonia line. North Face, on the other 
hand, puts rock climbing before window 
shopping, powder skirts before detachable 
hoods. "North Face is hot," he says. "This 
time next year, it'll be the hot thing. It's 
street wear." Street wear? I nod politely and 
busy myself with the Cap ilene collection. A 
street wear classification, industry code for 
knit caps, Raiders jackets, and all around 
gangsta chic, does not bode well for 
venerable mountaineering gear-maker 
North Face. It's a niche from which 
recovery is unlikely, the trek back to the 
trout streams and the Tetons an arduous 
one. Patagonia, the J. Press of backcountry 
outfitters, will not make the same mistake. 

The coolest Patagonia on campus is a 
fuzzy cream-colored zip-up (for all you 
techies: I'm talking Pile Glissade) which 
makes the wearer look rather like a sheep. 
Backpack honors go to Golden, Colorado's 
Mountainsmith line, whose smallest size 
(Grand Tour) seems to be designed for 
those nights you need to lug sixty or more 
books home from Sterling. But don't rush 
out to Trailblazer with your $150 in hand 
just yet-now that Mountainsmith is 
available for purchase up the block from 
Yale Station, it'll lose a little of its insider 
cachet. 

What kind of a frontier is this? With 
the requisite uniform subject to cooler-
than-thou and 1-was-there-first scrutiny 
(e.g., "Dude, your raingear is from when 
the Patagonia logo still had the pointy 
letters?"), it might appear that Yale's eye is 
focused more on Seventh Avenue than on 
Crested Butte. But like any uniform, this 
one serves as an identifier: a signal that 
though one may be serving out four years 
in this dreary town, one's allegiance lies 
elsewhere, amidst the fresh powder and the 
red rocks. 

Quite 
often, 
unlike 
subgroups of people who wear 
concert t-shirts without ever having 
heard the band or subscribe to Th( 
New Yorker because it looks so smart 
when visitors thumb through the 
magazines on the common room 
table, Trailblazer types really do 
strike out for the Territory. The trip 
West is fast replacing the European 
Grand Tour as the post-grad rite of 
passage. The next time you take a 
walk up Elm Street, stop in 
Trailblazer and you'll probably see 
someone you know trying on a 
synchilla or getting fitted for new 
hiking boots. Ask them what they're 
doing this summer: the answer 
probably involves a state west of the 
Mississippi. Thousands of miles 
away from East Rock or on that hike 
up Pikes Peak, whether or not your 
polypropelene will really wick away 
moisture actually matters.
