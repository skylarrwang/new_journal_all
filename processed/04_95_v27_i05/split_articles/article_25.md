literature. Professors appear to be 
institutionalizing a new canon of texts, 
once widely unread, that is debunking an 
older, more ethnocentric list of books. For 
example, Toni Morrison's Beloved and Zora 
Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching 
God repeatedly appear, as do Harriet 
Jacobs' Incidents in the Lifo of a Slave GirL 
and Frederick Douglass' well-known 
autobiographical narrative. According to 
Julia Ehrhardt (GRD '97), an American 
studies graduate student, although 
departments tend to be pretty loose about 
what constitutes literature, she believes that 
"we need to explore other books." Yet she 
also emphasizes chat there is a renewed and 
growing excitement for American literature 
in the academy. She hopes that this interest 
will attract scholars who study late 
twentieth-century fiction and lesbian and 
gay writing to Yale. 

But subjects like "gay literature" are 
more 
likely 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
interdisciplinary programs than in the 
English department. David Roman's 
seminars, for instance, on "The Literature 
of AIDS" and "Lesbian and Gay Theater 
and Performance" are women's studies 
course offerings and are not cross-listed. 
Ehrhardt argues that co encourage 
textual diversity at both the undergraduate 
and graduate levels, more graduate students 
should be allowed co reach seminars. Emily

studies graduate student, taught an 
extremely successful course entitled "The 
Black Aesthetic" last semester. More 
courses like Bernard's would be significant, 
Ehrhardt says, because graduate students 
are always "uncovering new texts to be 
read." In her own dissertation, for instance, 
she is "trying to fulfill her own excitement 
about American literature" by exploring the 
"social, economic, and personal reasons 
why we don't know the names" of five 
women writers-Grace King, Gertrude 
Atherton, Zona Gale, Dorothy Canfield 
Fisher, and Josephine Herbst-who were 
popular in their time, but whose works are 
not in print today. She hopes that the 
Americanist colloquium will help make all 
kinds of American literature a powerful 
presence once again for more faculty, 
graduate studen.ts, and eventually 
undergraduates. If the colloquium is here 
to stay, she argues, then it must also 
intensify interdepartmental understanding 
of different types of methodologies. 

This interdepartmental perspective will 
enable previously unacquainted professors 
and students to meet. Except during the 
periods when New Criticism and 
Deconstruction (see TN], October 14, 
1994) dominated literary theory at Yale, 
the English department has always been 
somewhat dispersed. Bryan Wolf (GRD 
'77), director of graduate studies for 
American studies and professor of English, 
calls this dispersion a specifically "Yale 
phenomenon." He describes Yale as an 
isolating place where scholars prefer to 
work in the privacy of their computer 
rooms, though the junior faculty has always 
been fairly communicative with each other. 
The Americanist colloquium, however, 
represents one group's attempt to resist the 
propensity not to interchange ideas. 
Wolf suggests that literary scholarship 
at 
Yale 
is 
unified 
a 
shared 
acknowledgment of the "importance of the 
text as an object for close reading." 
Although his emphasis sounds closer to 
formalism, Wolf explains that he is actually 
an interdisciplinary scholar. Although he 
teaches classes in the English department, 
he devotes about half of his rime to history 
or. art, which he turned to many years ago 
"by instinct" and because it was a "wide 
open field." He feels char "Art meets 
literature in a place chat doesn't need to be 
specifically lirerary ... [l] think of literature 
as a field that is simply not autonomous. 
Literature is part of a larger cultural field 
that deals with language, and that's where 
art meets literature." He concludes by 
commenting that "disc.s:mrse produces ways 
of seeing," which is the subject of his 
recent book about modernity and 
seventeenth-century Dutch art. However, 
his focus is usually upon nineteenth-
century 
art 
and 
non-mainstream 
contemporary art, particularly what is 
being 
produced 
Chicano 
community. Living up to Rowe's call for 
cross-period and cross-Atlantic Americanist 
scholarship, the attention Wolf pays to 
dive·rse cultures also reflects the emergence 
of postcolonial theory in academia today. 
Wolf describes postcolonialism as a way of 
"breaking out of traditional national 
categories." Wolf, however, is another 
example of an interdisciplinary Americanist 
Yale will be losing, at least for a year. While 
on sabbatical for the academic year of 
1995-1996, Wolf will be teaching an art 
history class at Stanford. 

Wolf is not the only prominent 
Americanist Yale will miss next year. 
Controversial hiring decisions within the 
past year point to some of the particular 
difficulties faced by black intellectuals. 
After intense recruiting, Yale failed to add 
two prominent black feminist intellectuals 
to its permanent faculty-Princeton's 
distinguished historian Nell Painter and 
UCLA's literary and film scholar Valerie 
Smith. University of London's Paul Gilroy 
and former Duke graduate student Maurice 
Wallace, however, will join Yale's faculty 
next year. But considering the coverage that 
black intellectuals have been receiving as 
the new "public intellectual" in such 
popular magazines as The Atlantic Monthly 
and The New Yorker, losing Painter and 
Smith can be construed as a huge blow to 
Yale's academic reputation. 

In particular, the controversy that 
surrounds Smith's failure to be approved by
