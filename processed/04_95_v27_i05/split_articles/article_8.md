If you missed the recent issue of Rolling 
Stone featuring the Drama School's buff 
and beautiful crop of soon-to-graduate 
third-year acting students, try to find a 
copy. T he Calvin Klein-clad actors 
'epitomize the Drama School's glossy 
mystique. We're unique, they seem to say. 
A breed apart. 

But Rolling Stone missed the real story, 
the inside scoop on the newest member of 
the Drama School scene. There's a new star 
on stage at the University Theater, one who 
steals the show every time he makes an 
entrance during the Yale Rep's production 
of Chekov's Uncle Vanya. As he waits in the 
wings for his cue, the other actors must feel 
a moment of terror. It may be his physical 
presence: short, flighcy, even slightly gamey. 
But when he struts onstage, the feeling 
must be pure chartreuse envy. In this 
sanctuary for rare birds, none can compare 
with him-and he always has the most 
striking costume. 

O nly if you have seen Uncle Vanya can 
you fully appreciate the effect produced by 
the onstage appearance of a white peacock. 
Of course most peacocks don't come in 
white: the very mention of the word 
summons an image of iridescent greens and 
blues, shades of gaudy pride. But Uncle 
\tanyas peacock-who answers ro the name 
Peeker-is a sort of minimalist mutant, 
perfectly in tune with maverick director 
Len Jenkin's vision for the show. Jenkin 
reportedly felt that a run-of-the-mill 
peacock would just not do the trick, 
and who can argue? The stage 
lights accentuate the stately curve 
of Peeker's body and illuminate 
t he showy expanse of his 
snow-white 
tail. 

The 
immaculate bird is the 
incarnation of the theatrical 
sublime in a show replete 
with nuance, charm, and 
style. 

Su blime, that 
is, if Peeker doesn't 
decide to flap his 
wings. The bird is, through no fault of his 
own, quite a prima donna. First of all, 
white peacocks cost about $300, six times 
as much as your average multicolored 
peacock. Peeker also requires special living 
accommodations: he spends his downtime 
in a cage at the Yale Animal Control center, 
with the Med School's sundry doomed 
rodents. As the kinder and gentler Drama 
School has a policy of not destroying has-
been actors, Peeker will not meet the fate of 
his neighbors. He must be sold or given 
away after the show closes on April 15. 

This means that Peeker's wings could not 
be clipped. Leashed at the ankle, Peeker is 
not exactly a free bird when he crosses the 
stage to open and close each performance 
of Uncle Vtmya, but his presence injects a 
delicious unpredictability befitting Jenkin's 
slightly loopy production. 

Though they maintain a professional 
resolve about the situation, the human 
actors know that working next to Peeker 
means flouting a long-standing maxim. 
"The actors don't like being on stage with 
it-surprise, surprise," says a Technical 
Design and Production student familiar 
with the production. "Definite 'dogs and 
children' potential. They're afraid of being 
upstaged." 

Or perhaps just being pecked ro death. 
This seems unlikely, however, as Kiki Short 
(ORA '95) stands ready ro dash onstage to 
save her classmates in the unlikely event 
that Peeker runs amok. As the show's 
official Peacock Wrangler, Short has so far 
had no such challenges. Her main job is to 
give Peeker his cues, basically a matter of 
pushing his plumed ass onstage and then 
snatching him up in the dark of the scene 
change. Peeker's big moment comes in the 
last scene, when he jumps up onto a table. 
It's not as if he has to jump through 
flaming hoops, but audiences love it all the 
same. 

At curtain call, though, the familiar 
pecking order reasserts itself and the 
humans get all the applause. The talented 
Uncle Vanya troupe takes a bow, sans 
Peeker. It looks like he needs a better 
agent-one who doesn't mind getting paid 
chicken feed.
