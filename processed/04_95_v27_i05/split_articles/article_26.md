s A FRESHMAN at Yale, I've heard my 
share of theories about the importance 
of Yale vis-a-vis the world. 
But I wasn't really ready for this one. New Haven resident Jere 
Garceau-and the religious group he founded-thinks the "forces 
of darkness" may have targeted Yale in a maniacal scheme to take 
over the world. As Jere (pronounced "Jerry") puts it, "If you're the 
enemy, this is obviously the place where you are going to come to 
try to take control." 

Okay, evangelism is all the rage all around the country. People 
on· Cross Campus hand out the booklets with eyes overflowing 
with pity for the damned Yale student who brushes past them 
indifferently. And Jesse Jackson got downright biblical in his Barrell 
Christianity at Yale. Admittedly, it's a broad topic, but my friend 
had an interesting theory. "Suppose this is truth," he said picking 
up the salt shaker and holding it up between us. "When I look at 
it, I can only see part of it. But when you and I both look at it, we 
can see almost the whole thing! This is what people think truth 
is-that the more people you have telling you what they see, the 
closer we'll be to knowing what it really is. Maybe people don't like 
the idea that Jesus claimed that He Himself was the truth." 

"Yale is a very different place from what it was," my friend 
continued. "Founded under a Christian covenant: the Yale Charter 
Chapel speech last month-but a 
group that worries that Yale may 
be the battlefield for a global 
clash between good and evil? 
Jere Garceau thinks the "forces of 
of 1701, it was chartered as a 
place to train young men to 
disseminate the Gospel. They 
studied Greek and Hebrew, and 
they had required prayer." 

"''m not talking about Satan 
walking in with cloven hooves 
and a forked tail," Jere clarifies. 
"It's much more subtle than that 
because the Scripture says, he 
always comes as an angel of 
light."

world. "If you're the enemy, this is 
obviously the place where you are 
going to come to try to take control." 
Yikes! "Lux" will never sound 
the same again. 

If you're wondering why 
you've never heard of Jere and his group before-after all, this stuff 
reeks of Rumpur-it's because, well, it's a coven operation. The 
prayer groups meet in Dwight Chapel and Marquand Chapel at the 
Yale Divinity School five days a week from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. There 
they pray for a religious revival on Yale's campus. 

For four years now, they have been praying for a spiritual 
revival at Yale in the near future-and especially praying for every 
new freshman class. Chances are, if you're reading this article, 
they've been praying for you too, in the early morning hours, as 
you agonize over problem sets and papers. When I first met Jere he 
said to me, "You're class of '98, right? You're one of the guys we've 
been praying for!" 

I first heard about the prayer group-which doesn't

instead of traveling abroad for converts, they focus on Yale itself. 
It's as if the whole cycle of conversion has come full circle. I was 
curious. The next day I met with Jere at Ingall's rink to talk to him 
about the group. 

Jere was as nice and as decent as a man could be. We talked as he 
watched his two sons play hockey. He explained that he and some of 
his friends had come together to form the prayer group in 1990 afrer 
an international student at Yale committed suicide. Jere was 
concerned that the event was the worst in a series of manifestations 
of Yale's spiritual depravity. 

If fewer believers means "spiritual depravity," then it is hard to 
argue with him on this point. One need only exhume the musty 
parchment of the Yale Charter from its eternal resting

were talking about the attitudes people have towards
