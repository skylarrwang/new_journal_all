EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Prodded by the woman from Head 
Start, parents open up, complaining about 
not having enough time for themselves, 
watching bills pile up, taking care of their 
kids. A stack of xeroxes circulates: "A Stress-
Level Checklist;" "All Stressed Our? Ten 
Tips for De-stressing Your Life;" a poem 
called ''I'd Pick More Daisies," written by an 
87 year-old woman from Louisville, 
Kentucky. The parents leave the circle of 
chairs and Marcia Jones, mother of fourth-
grader Patrick, remarks, "I wish the program 
had come into action earlier, so that other 
families could have had this opportunity." 
Perhaps Jones' wish will come true. I 
Have a Dream's goal is to raise enough 
money to sponsor a second class of 
Dreamers. Still, Jones is right-the program 
lavishes such extraordinary opportunity on 
such: a tiny percentage of children. Shirley 
Hayes, Shatara's grandmother, agrees, and 
then adds, "You hate to sound selfish, but 
I'm glad that it was this class that was 
picked. I think every patent would feel that 
way." 

In the schools where I Have a Dream 
programs are set up, ordinarily 50 percent of 
each entering freshman class will graduate; 
but an I Have a Dream class boasts an 85 to 
90 percent graduation race. What about the 
East Rock Dreamers? "It's hard to predict 
that all 56 will make it," says Lieberman. 
"The question is, will they have the ability 
to go, and will they want to go when the 
time comes? Not all kids are college-
bound-that's why we say college or 
vocational school tuition. At least they have 
the opportunity. If nothing else, they'll get 
more out of high school and elementary 
school." He pauses. "There is a chance that 
all 56 will go. I'm here to help give these 
opportunities and to give another stable 
force in their lives."
