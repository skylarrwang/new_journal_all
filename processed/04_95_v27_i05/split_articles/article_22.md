the foundation and is now responsible for 
shepherding 56 fourth-graders through nine 
years of school. In his spare time, he studies 
for the bar exam-"just in case one of my 
friends kills someone and I need to defend 
him." 


n the East Rock cafeteria, law school 
seems a lifetime away. Ten minutes into 
today's session, the activity centers 
around three focal points: the cups of fruit 
punch; the boxes of Cheez-Its; and 
Lieberman, who stands at the front of the 
cafeteria, joking around with the students, 
and answering the questions of adult 
volunteers. "Oh my Lord," whispers a 
Quinnipiac College volunteer standing on 
my left, stunned by the volume of energy in 
the room. A Dreamer cartwheels across the 
auditorium floor. Others wander around the 
cafeteria in various permutations of dark-
green plaid school uniforms. A few 
Dreamers sit at the benches, working with 
tutors, talking to friends, scraping the last of 
the orange powder from the bottom of a box 
of Cheez-Its. 


At 3 p.m. I sit on the back wall of•East 
Rock's sunken auditorium, the cafeteria 
spread out before me. In front of me an 
adult mentor introduces herself to a student. 
"Hi. How are you? My name is Ruth. I'm 
going to be helping you with your 
homework." The Dreamer doesn't look 
enthused; but when I ask her if I can 
interview her, Astrid, age ten, flashes a shy 
smile and then takes a seat next to me. 
Her friends Leyda and Staci, also age 
ten, soon join us. Leyda, accompanied by 
nods from the other Dreamers, tells me how 
her parents had reacted to the news. "Mine 
were really happy. They hugged me and 
kissed me. They said, 'We only have to pay 
for o'ne now'-my brother's." The other two 
girls' descriptions echo Leyda's. Still, Staci 
points out, it isn't always easy being a 
Dreamer. "Now they expect us to write big 
compositions and essays. We get harder 
work, we're working hard to make this man 
narn'ed Mr. Highsmith ·and our teacher and 
our parents and many other people proud of 
us. " 


Mr. Highsmith is Carlton Highsmith, a 
businessman from Hamden, and a member 
of New Haven I Have a Dream's board of 
directors. Highsmith acts as the sponsor 
figure for East Rock's Dreamers; besides his 
financial contribution to the project, he 
serves as a role model. "I know that a 
program like I Have a Dream works because 
I was the product of [a similar] program," 
Highsmith tells me over the phone a few 
days after my visit to East Rock. Answering 
questions in warm, measured tones, he 
sounds quite satisfied with where he is now, 
which is a long way from where he began. 
Highsmith grew up in a poor rural town in 
eastern North Carolina. After finishing 
second in his high school class, he applied to 
college. The University of Wisconsin denied 
him admission at first; a week later, 
Highsmith received a second letter, 
accepting him under the newly instituted 
"Special Program of Tutorial and Financial 
Assistance." Highsmith thrived at Wisconsin 
and then went to work in "corporate 
America." Today he owns Specialized 
Packaging International and is putting his 
own two children through college. 


Highsmith wants to prove to the 
Dreamers that they, too, can achieve success. 
In talking with the fourth-graders, though, 
he realizes their concepts of success vary 
wildly. "A lot of them say [success is] having 
a lot of money. Others say it's doing 
something that you enjoy doing, or being 
respected by other people, or being famous." 
He continued, "One little girl told me, 
'success is when people love you."' If any 
doubt about his own definition of success 
remains, he added, "The best part is seeing 
how really sharp they are and how, in fact, 
there's so much inside of them that's 
bursting to come out. I'tn looking forward 
to seeing 56 fourth-graders grow and 
develop like my own children." 


B 
ack in the cafeteria, the Dreamers give 
Highsmith rave reviews. "He's nice to 
us," Staci responds emphatically. 
Leyda, nodding her head, adds, "He's nice, 
and we met his wife. I think he's rich to do 
all this, and kind." (Later that week, 
Highsmith laughs when he hears this and 
responds, "I told them, 'I'm not rich; I work 
for a living'"). Astrid chimes in, "We go out 
for our birthdays with Mr. Highsmith. He 
gives us birthday cards and takes us out for 
lunch." She mentions a big meeting held for 
all the Dreamers and their families, in which 
a classmate, Arturo, gave a speech. I ask her

to point him out to me, and obligingly she 
screams his name across the cafeteria. A 
dark-haired boy darts towards us from out 
of the crowd. I thank the girls for their time 
and watch them disappear into a swirl of 
chatter on my right. 


Arturo, perched on the rim of the 
auditorium wall, only grudgingly admits, 
first, to being Arturo, then to being the 
Arturo who gave a speech at the big 
meeting: He tells me the speech was about 
kids and things they want to be. "I want to 
be a fisherman," Arturo tells me. Two more 
heads pop up. Introductions are made. 
Pedro and Francisco are told they have 
walked into a magazine interview. Pedro is 
game. "Fishermen don't get paid a lot," he 
informs Arturo. Arturo, though, remains 
undaunted. "They do get paid a lot when 
they get fish to the flea market." Pedro, 
satisfied by this, turns the spotlight on 
himself. "I think that a lawyer and an 
architect get paid a lot. Right now, I want to 
be a lawyer, but maybe I want to be 
something else." Then, after a moment of 
contemplation, "A judge makes a lot more 
than a lawyer and an architect." 


M
irations aside, Pedro and his 
assmates do not have an easy road 
ead of them. The group as a whole 
is, according to Lieberman, "very low 
academically." Only four students fulfill 
expectations for their grade level, and none 
exceed them. Many started the year with 
their reading or math skills at only a second 
grade level. Barbara Guarniere, a fourth-
grade teacher at East Rock, explains, "At this 
point, we are just trying to meet student 
needs on an individual basis. You have to 
remember," she add, "that the program 
began last October and that some of the 
tutors only started in January." 


Still, Lieberman says that progress is 
already visible. "Looking at the attendance 
lists," he says, "there are fewer fourth graders 
absent than before the program started." I 
Have a Dream backs up its financial 
guarantee with a program designed to keep 
students attending, and focused on, school: 
the enrichment program features activities 
such as dance classes, crafts, and ta~ kwon 
APIUL 14> 1995 
dtJ; "inner city outings," in which students 
go on day hikes in the country, led by the 
Sierra Club; and the after-school program. 
Volunteer tutors from the New H aven 
community work one-on-one with students 
on their homework. Participants in 
Americorps, a federally funded program that 
provides educational stipends in exchange 
for community engagements, work with 
groups of five to six Dreamers on basic 
reading and math skills. 


Staci has reappeared, with a suggestion: 
"Talk to Shatara. She's really nice." She drags 
along a tall girl with a wide-cheeked smile. 
Shatara proceeds to give rave reviews, in the 
way only a fourth-grader can, for everything 
from the principal and vice-principal ("very 
nice") to her teacher ("very nice"), to the 
school ("a very nice place to go"). 


Nearly 30 minutes have passed in the 
after-school session, and only a few students 
remain at the blue tables. The punch ran 
out ten minutes ago. A small girl, still in her 
green plaid uniform, sits serenely at the end 
of one of the closer tables. The girl's name is 
Ashley. I ask her how she spells it, and her 
sister, a kindergartener with the same saucer.. 
eyes, spells along with "her. "The program 
hasn't really changed my life," Ashley reveals 
to me, as her sister stands by loyally. "I'm 
still working hard, I do my homework, still 
have chores at home." In contrast to the 
other students, she appears pretty calm. "I 
don't get excited very much," she admits. 
Then, "But I'm happy because I get to go to
