A newspaper prepared New Haven radicals in the art of self-defense.

ne old brick building still stands on State Street. Next to 
it is a cluttered parking lot and one more abandoned 
structure. After that, where once there srood a row of 
beautiful Victorian houses, there is a long stretch of 
nothing. Everything was bulldozed to make way for a multi-level 
parking lot that never happened. 

The remaining building, on the corner of State and Elm, has 
been more fortunate by far than its fallen comrades. Bagdon's, the of 
four gourmet restaurants on that spot, even attracted the dainty 
nose of a New York Times restaurant reviewer wlien word of its 
culinary delights began wafting through the suburbs. "White brick 
walls, unobtrusive gray carpeting, black chairs, white-napped tables 
(luxuriously spaced) and indirect wall lighting create a handsome 
atmosphere," the reviewer wrote. "The short menu offers several 
popular dishes of New American Cooking, adding to the 
restaurant's style." 

Unbeknownst to the effusive author, this seemingly innocuous 
brick corner building once offered a much more fiery brand of 
"New American Cooking." From 1969 to 1972, before everything 
was covered over with "unobtrusive gray carpeting," it was home to 
the Bread and Roses Coffeehouse. A large black snake wound its 
way across the front window: the "Don't tread on me" symbol of the 
American Revolution. Beside the door, a handwritten sign with the 
words "No Dope Please" hung where the New York Times article, 
placed inside an elegant frame, hangs today. 

"Hearts starve as welL as bodies, 
Give us bread, but give us roses!" 

T
he name Bread and Roses came from a poem about the 
famous seamstress strike of 1912, organized by the ill-fated 
Industrial Workers of the World in Lawrence, Massachusetts. 
In New Haven, Bread and Roses was the official coffeehouse of 
another radical political organization: the American Independent 
Movement (AIM). With two primary objectives-an end to the 
Vietnam war and a more equal distribution of wealth in the United 
States-AIM had been a presence in New Haven since 1966, the 
year it ran Yale professor Bob Cook for Congress on an anti-war 
platform. People affiliated with AIM would congregate at Bread and 
Roses for group discussions, movies, and live music, 
launched in the city, the patrons of Bread and Roses 
suddenly had a lot more to talk about. The J 
coffeehouse became the haunt for the writers 
and readers of New Haven's first and !:-
radical, leftist newspaper: the Modern Times. 
Staffers sat around simple coffeehouse tables, 
discussing the declining quality of public 
education, the shortage of health care, or the 
housing crisis in New Haven. An editorial 
Â·inside the first issue declared, "In New 
Haven, as elsewhere, people are moving to I 
change the way they work and learn. Conditiom 
..... lrlll~ .... 
on the job, in the schools, in 
neighborhoods and cities are 
changing as people demand a new 
and free society." Over the next 
five years, Modern Times would 
herald this new and free society.

n the years following the 
disastrous Tet offensive in 
January, 1968, people in 
New Haven and elsewhere 
grew more radical. The grisly 
details of the battle led many 
Americans to conclude that the 
U.S. was not, in fact, winning the 
war, and perhaps never would. Rick Wolff 
(GRD '69), who taught economics at Yale 
during the winrer of '68, recalls the day his 
students learned of the shocking American losses. 
"It was as if a blizzard had blown through their 
minds," he said. As one of the few at Yale who had 
spoken out against the war, Wolff was bombarded by 
questions. Students wanted to know exactly what was going 
on. 

The Modem Times came onto the scene as the voice of 
people from all walks of life who felt they had been betrayed 
by the system. In a one-parry Democratic city whose two 
newspapers were run by the same conservative 
all with political undertones. 
On May 1, 1970, when a new publication was 
family, the new voice was a startling one. A 
genuine grass-roots effort, the paper drew
