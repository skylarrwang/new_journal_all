New Hoven's Winchester rifle factory 
looks to the future by invoking the 
legends of the Old West. 

M
he edge of New Haven on Winchester Avenue lies a 
turistic arms factory. Built in 1994 by Giat 
dustries, the new factory of the U.S. Repeating Arms 
mpany, Inc. makes Winchester rifles and shotguns 
for hunting and sport-shooting. Here a declining war-munitions 
factory tries to reverse its downward trend and set forth a new 
image of modern production. At the front of this effort to bring 
Winchester into the twenty-first century is spokesman John 
Wayne. 

When the Duke was gunning down cinematic bandits and 
hustlers in the 1940s, Winchester was at its peak, with a 
workforce 40 times larger than its current group of 475 
employees. Only two of the factory buildings from that era 
remain. The older of the two is completely vacated and 
decaying; through its glassless windows 
one can still see the large outdated 
machines left behind when the building 
closed. The other building, recently 
declared a New Haven landmark, 
currently houses larger machinery and 
Winchester's management offices. The 
company is slowly phasing out the 
building, relocating its departments to 
~ the new factory. A larger than life

The 1994 opening of the state-of-
}; the-art facility across the street seemed 
~ inconceivable just a few years ago . 
~ Winchester struggled through 1990, 
sometimes failing to pay its workers 
and eventually shutting down for three 
months. Cutting corners on the 
assembly line had led to a decline in the 
quality of the rifles produced. It seemed 
possible that the Winchester Rifle 
would be no more. That's when 


Giat, a private company owned by the French government, stepped 
in. In 1991 it bought Winchester and initiated plans to build the 
new factory. 

On paper Giat's decision made no sense. At the time, Winchester 
desperately needed new machinery and facilities, and this wasn't the 
first time that the company was on the fiscal ropes. Throughout its 
convoluted financial history, Winchester has often teetered on the 
verge of bankruptcy. In 1981, the top management purchased 
Winchester and re-formed it as the U.S. Repeating Arms Company. 
In 1985 the company received a $6 million federal loan guarantee, 
but nevertheless filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1986. 

Throughout this period, Winchester somehow managed to continue 
producing. 

Winchester's history has always been characterized by cycles of 
boom and bust, having supplied militaries from its founding in the 
late nineteenth century through the 1950s. Mexican troops fighting 
for independence from France used Winchesters. The Union even 
used a few of rhe Henry model rifles near the end of the American 
Civil War. When the Spanish-American War began in 1898, 
Winchester had 3,000 employees and was operating 24 hours a day. 
And in World War I, Winchester's 17,000 workers supplied firearms 
nor only to the Americans but also to the British. 

Despite the 500,000 rifles produced for the Allies in WWI, 
Winchester soon faced low prices and escalating costs. The plant 
doubled irs size and drastically increased employment levels for war-
time production. After the war was over, to make use of the extra 
machinery and workers, Winchester began manufacturing new 
products. The Winchester line grew to include everything from paint 
to baseball mitts, fishing rods ro roller skates. It distributed irs 
products nationwide through Winchester catalogs and company 
APRIL 14, 1995 
stores, much like Sears and Roebuck. Their 300-page catalog from 
1927 boasted, "Winchester is a line of which you can weU be proud." 

These side productions were dropped during the Depression 
when Olin Industries, another arms manufacturer, saved Winchester 
from irs first bankruptcy. Olin returned to producing strictly 
firearms, just in time to benefit from the increased demand caused by 
World War II. 

The Winchester of WWII employed 20,000 people and reached 
unprecedented levels of production, bur that number again tapered 
off dramatically after the war. Winchester depended on government 
contracts until the end of rhe Korean War. Since that rime, the 
company repeatedly reduced its workforce. 

When it bought Winchester in 1991, Giat did not foresee a war 
in America's future. Nor did its management plan to produce 
military weapons or any other type of offensive arms. There was only 
one logical reason to invest in Winchester: John Wayne. 

In the films of the 40s and 50s, slinging his Winchester through 
the American West, John Wayne gave the company something 
money. couldn't buy: reputation. The Winchester rifle became a part 
of American history and lore. It was "the gun that won the West" in 
the hands of the cowboys that the Duke portrayed. It was also the 
gun that won WWII in the hands of the men of John Wayne's 
generation. A Winchester rifle was one of quality. But the 
Winchester also had a special character. As a symbol of aU that was 
American, it was something of which a nation at war could be proud. 

Giat bought into the Winchester myth. The mystique behind the 
gun was somehow greater than the sum of the barrel and stocks, 
springs and levers. And the image of the urban factory worker who 
placed each piece into the gun only added to the mystique. 

And just as he had popularized the Winchester in the 1940s, 


Wayne became the spokesman for a new 
generation ofWinchester products. 

When Giat took over, it combined the 
image of the Old West with that of a family 
of urban workers. In its workplace, Giat has 
tried to return to the attitude of the 40s and 
50s, when Winchester was one very proud 
fa• -:ly. The Wmchester myth comes across 
cl . ·I; in the product catalog. It touts the 
"Weapons of Legend" as a return to quality. 
Viewing the scenes depicted, one might 
imagine that the land west of the Mississippi 
remains an untamed wilderness. The logo 
portrays a saddled cowboy, harkening back 
to the time when Annie Oakley and Buffalo 
Bill were carrying Winchesters. 

Winchester's own promotional video 
also highlights the "new anitude and 
enthusiasm" among workers since Giat took 
over. It features Mike Sanchez, a shotgun 
machine operator, saying, "The way we all 
communicate is like one family. Everybody 
treats others like family." It's obviously to 
Winchester's advantage to portray its 
workforce as content and cooperative, but 
this depiction of the situation may turn out 
to be more than just an image for the sake of 
public relations-Giat's management may 
have succeeded at inspiring a real 
enthusiasm in the factory. 

Several policies have been particularly 
12 
~elpfuJ in raising employee morale. For the 
past seven years, Winchester has used the 
"team cell" production method rather than 
the standard assembly line. A small group of 
workers in a particular part of the factory 
add a specific part to a gun before it moves 
on to the next stage. T he move to the new 
factory, entirely contained on one floor, 
simplifies employee tasks by placing 
complementary "team cells" close to each 
other. "Team cells" have encouraged 
cooperation among a tightly knit group. 
When the workers were spread out across 
the four cavernous Aoors of the old factory, 
working at Winchester meant anonymity. 

Winchester set up "re-think teams" in 
each department. Composed of all the 
management and 
workers 
in 
the 
department, these groups provide a forum 
for ideas on ways to improve the production 
method or general factory conditions. "In 
our department, we've improved everything 
from the machines to the toilet paper in the 
bathrooms," said Darrell Morbidelli, a 
worker in the shotgun department. Re-think 
teams epitomize a new cooperation between 
management and the union workers. Before 
Giat, Winchester's recent history was 
marked by constant conflict between the 
International Machinists Union and 
management. "We definitely have more of a

voice [now] than before Giat took over," 
said Morbidelli. 

The language used by the workers to 
describe the atmosphere in the plant and the 
future of the company resembles the 
rhetotic in Winchester's promotional 
materials. Leaving work for the day, Bob 
Forte, also from the shotgun department, 
explained, "The problems that had existed 
inside the factory have been solved." He 
added, "There's a new anitude in the 
factory. There's definitely a sense that we're 
on the way up." 

Winchester seems to have succeeded in 
creating a family-like working environment. 
The atmosphere they have sought to create 
recalls that which arose naturally at 
Wmchester during WWII, when the factory 
was almost a city within a city. 

F
rom 1942 through the 1950s, 
employees published Winchestn Lifo, a 
monthly mag22ine whose title reAects 
the degree to which workers identified 
themselves with their workplace. The pages 
of the magazine recorded the social lives and 
family lives of the workers. For many 
employees these revolved around the factory. 
The Winchester Club, for example, was an 
employee facility next to the factory that 
included a full gymnasium and workout 
equipment. Employees staged musicals and 
variety shows throughout this period. 
Wmchester boasted an extensive recreational 
sport league, with both men and women 
employees playing for 
their 
own
