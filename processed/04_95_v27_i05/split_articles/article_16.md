Late on the evening of March 26, 1986, Bonnie Jean Foreshaw 
dropped off a friend in a rough section of Hartford. On her 
way home to Bloomfield she stopped at rhe Jamaica 
Progressive League, a social club on Albany Avenue. Several 
months earlier she had separated from her abusive husband, who 
co-ntinued to stalk her and her children. Fearing an attack from him, 
she had recently starred carrying a handgun for the first time in her 
life. 


Inside the club a man Bonnie did not know offered to buy her a 
drink. She declined, saying she did not accept drinks from strangers. 
The man, Hector Freeman, grew angry and began to shout that he 
would "fuck her up." She left, and he followed her out to the street, 
accompanied by a woman named Joyce Amos, whom Bonnie had 
never met bur who seemed to know Freeman. Amos tried to stop him 
from harassing Bonnie, bur without success. As Freeman came toward 
her, Bonnie pulled our her gun and fired without aiming, hoping to 
scare him away. But he pulled Amos in front of him, and the bullet 
hit her, ricocheting fatally off her shoulder blade into her heart. 


Doctors discovered that Amos was six months pregnant; the fetus was 
delivered stillborn. 


Bonnie Foreshaw is now serving a 45-year sentence for murder in 
the first degree, the longest sentence currently imposed on any 
woman in the state of Connecticut. 


When Ondi Timoner (SY '94) mer Bonnie, Ondi was four 
months away from graduation. Bonnie faced another 38 years at 
Niantic Correctional Facility for Women in East Lyme. Ondi was 
filming her senior project, a documentary called voices From Inside 
1ime, based on interviews with women at the Niantic prison school. 
On the last day of filming she sought out Bonnie at the urging of 
several other inmates, who called Bonnie a role model and an 
inspiration. 


While the guards were changing shift, Ondi managed to sneak her 
camera into Bonnie's cell for an hour-long, unmonitored interview. 
sympathetic portrait of one group of what she caJls "transgressive • 
women." Bur nothing had prepared her for the contents of that hour. 


Bonnie contended that her rights had been violated from the ... 
moment she was taken into custody. After the shooting, a number of ·..; 
political factors having liule to do with her had shaped her case: a 
vocal anti-abortion lobby seeking a double murder charge for the 
• 
deaths of Amos and her fetus; a politically sensitive state's attorney ~= 
and state legislature in an election year; and a public defender of • 
prodigious incompetence. Having lost her her first appeal and served 
=
eight years in prison, Bonnie was preparing a habeas corpus action . ; a
against the state. Still awaiting scheduling, that suit will auempt to -'{ 
prove that Bonnie's imprisonment is illegal, on the grounds that her -':: 
original trial violated her Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. 


Ondi was deeply affected by what she calls the "miscarriage of -; 
justice" that had allowed Bonnie to be railroaded by the legal system. 
She resolved to use aU the resources at her disposal to help Bonnie set 
the record straight. Her determination resulted in a feature-length _ 
documentary devoted to Bonnie's life and case, called The Naturr of :: 
the B£ast. The film is a testament to the commitment of two women ·; 
on opposite sides of the camera and opposite extremes of privilege, 
united in pursuit of justice. 


Ondi had long been interesred in the subject of 
authority and the influence of gender, class, and race 
on its administration, particularly in cases involving 
bartered women. She had conceived of voices as a 
crime-ridden Liberty City area with the stepfather ::
