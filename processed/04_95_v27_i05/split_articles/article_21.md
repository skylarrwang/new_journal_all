EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Modern Tim~s. a socialist publication, 
figured so prominently in a movement 
against what was, at some levels, a 
government-planned economy in New 
Haven. As a former lawyer for the New 
Haven Redevelopment Agency James 
Whitney (SM '64, LAW '68, M.ARC '68) 
recalled, "Redevelopment was for poor 
cities, not for poor people." lr aimed to 
rebuild the city center to establish a firm tax 
base which would be used to aid poor 
people. "Having a commercial core is part 
of what makes a city a city," Whitney 
explained, "especially in a state which is so 
. dependent on property taxes and which 
does such a bad job of distributing them." 


Unfortunately, the development 
agency's unspoken motto ran something 
like: demolish first, think later. A cartoon in 
the Modern Timn depicted two women 
stand ing in front of a plaque. In the 
background stood a sprawling, modern 
building with walls like those of an Amtrak 
train. One woman read the plaque to the 
other. "It says Pomburg, settled in 1530, 
survived the Indian massacres, the 
Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil 
War, wiped out by shopping center 
development in 1968." 


The Motkrn Tim~· opposition would be 
instrumental in stopping several unpopular 
plans, including one to build a ring road 
around Yale, cuning it off from the rest of 
the city. According to the Mod~rn Times, 
the plan, zealously backed by Yale, would 
have d isplaced 423 fami lies and 201 
businesses. 

Do not oppou superior power with power. 
Sidestep or harmonize your body to take 
advantage of th~ opponmt's w~ight and 
strmgth. (This will usually require some 
background lmowkdge ofstlf defonse). 

n the 70s, Wolff said, "Centrifugal force 
began to pull things apart. The women 
wanted to go their way; the blacks 
wanted to go their way." People involved 
with the Modern Times were increasingly 
divided along the lines of the issues rhey 
considered most important. To reAect this, 
many wanted the paper divided into nvo·
page sections according to subject: one 
section for feminist issues, one for 
environmental issues, and so forth. The 
AIM people felt that this approach would 
make the paper appear to be too much of a 
grab bag of random issues. It wanted to 
maintain a definite identity for the paper, 
revolving around their central project of 
identifying who had wealth and whether it 
was being used to benefit the community. 
Finally, there was a standoff. 

Members of AIM entered into a 
passionate argument with feminists and 
their sympathizers over whether rhe Modern 
Times should run a front page story about 
abortion (this was before Roe v. Wade). AIM 
partisans argued rhar such a story would 
risk alienating the working class, a great 
many of whom were Roman Catholic, and 
thus compromise the paper's position as a 
socialist publication. Virginia BlaisdeU, one 
of the feminists, remembers trying in vain 
to convince AIM men that the issue was not 
perhaps as threatening and divisive as they 
supposed. She didn't think the paper had 
nearly the readership among New Haven's 
working class that AIM liked to imagine. 

Bur AIM would have none of it. In the end, 
it decided to create an editorial policy 
(before, there had been few limits to what 
the paper would print) which basically 
stipulated that AIM would make all 
editorial decisions. Blaisdell and 28 others 
walked out. 

Henry Lowendorf, an editor of the 
Modern Times, was one of those who left. 
He thought the "collective process" that 
characterized the production of the Modern 
Times was one of the paper's g reatesc 
strengths, and he became quickly 
disenchanted when AIM members began 
making unilateral decisions. 

Wolff readily admitted that the Modern 
Times "paid a heavy price for AIM's 
decision." The paper began to weaken 
visibly in the next several years, first falling 
from 16 pages down to eight, and finally 
beginning to publish less frequently. Bur 
Wolff attributed the demise of rhe 
newspaper to larger forces as well. "When 
Nixon feU out of the war, the steam went 
out of the American left movement," he 
said. "Half the people you used to be able 
to count on to help with the Modern Times 
just faded away." 

Above all, use discretion to counter-attack 
effectively. Use the degree of punishment 
befitting the situation. (Avoid brutality.} 

n the days of the Modern Times, radical-
minded people were able to avoid 
brutality. The sint.nion was not yet 
desperate. In the 70s, Wolff confessed, even 
the radicals themselves thought New Haven 
could be successfully redeveloped, if only 
the city's leaders became more socially 
aware, or socially realistic. 

It is hard to feel that way in 1995. As 
Wolff, now an economics professor at the 
University of Massachussetts drives through 
Fair H aven, once New Haven's liveliest 
neighborhood, he stares at the gaping, black 
windows of burnt-out houses, at yard after 
yard strewn with unbelievable amounts of 
garbage. In his mind he goes over his old 
theories. If only the city had invested more 
in irs people, in educating them and giving 
them a healthy environment in which to 
live in. Then maybe they could have 
"redeveloped" their own city. 

Wolff shakes his head. Today, he thinks, 
not even the Modern Times could bridge the 
communication gap between the rich and 
poor. He continues his demoralizing tour of 
the once great working-class neighborhoods 
of rhe city. In Newhallville, he drives past 
Science Park, the project that Mayor John 
DeStefano, Jr. hopes will resuscitate New 
Haven's economy in the 1990s. Science 
Park sits in the middle of the blighted 
neighborhood, surrounded by a high steel 
fence. There are guard stations at the gates 
where anyone wishing to enter must present 
identification. It is like a military outpost in 
enemy territory. 

The once radical Rick Wolff shivers to 
imagine the next counter attack.
