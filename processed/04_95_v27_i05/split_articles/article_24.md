on March 29, a group of Yale faculty and graduate 
students, mainly from the English department, 
American studies and African-American studies 
programs, gathered at the Whitney Humanities Center 
for the first Americanist colloquium at Yale. The question that this 
colloquium attempted to address was, "What's an Americanist 
~nyway?" Although posed somewhat flippantly, the query is 
essentially a pretext for convening a gathering of scholars who 
study and theorize about American literature-if only they could 
come to a consensus that that is indeed what an Americanist is. 
Scholars in many departments focus on American topics, but 
debate in the English department is at times especially volatile. 
Although the colloquium initiated discussion, few of its panel 
participants-Richard Brodhead (BR '68, GRD '72), Dean of Yale 
College and English professor; English professors Thomas Â· 
Whitaker (GRD '53), Vera Kutzinski (GRD '85), Katherine Rowe; 
and American studies professor Michael Denning (GRD '84)-
would commit to a definition of an Americanist. At times, there 
. seemed to be outright discomfort with the idea of delineating 
precisely what lies behind self-identification as an Americanist. 
Rowe suggested, "To be an Americanist is to read American 
literature, to look at American art, to talk about American film. For 
me, (to be] an Americanist is also to be a 'comparatist."' She 
commented that to be a "comparatist" is to look across historical 
periods, across the Atlantic, and across northern and southern 
borders to Canada, Mexico, and South America. 

Although Rowe gave a clear definition of an Americanist, the 
rest of the panel focused more on what it means to be a literary 
scholar than on what it means to study specifically American 
literature and culture. The conversation eventually led to a 
discussion of the differences between interdisciplinary studies at 
Yale and more traditional approaches to literature. This turn was 
not unexpected, since Americanists-~d we will call them that for 
lack of a better word-have been moving towards more 
interdisciplinary approaches to literature. 

American studies, however, has its origins in a drastically 
different critical location. It emerged as a post-WWII program and 
began as a means of exploring what was once known as "American 
Exceptionalism." This school of thought relied on 
a specific canon approached from an intertextual 
perspective. A critic would line up a few works of 
literature, see what was similar between them, and explain their 
distinctive "Americanness" through these similarities. This 
methodology principally stayed within the novel, poem, or short 
story being read, quite often producing brilliant and lucid insight 
into the aesthetics and form of a text. A drawback to this analysis 
was that the historical and cultural context that may have 
contributed to the text's formation were often disregarded. 

At the colloquium Brodhead noted that today this 
methodology would be viewed by many as "ill-considered rubbish" 
because it was ahistorical and ignored the social, economic, and 
political circumstances of the time. Today a literary critic would be 
expected to examine not only a canonical short story, but the 
newspaper in which it was published, the other fiction published 
along with it, and the political climate of the nation at that 
particular historical moment. American studies has grown 
increasingly interdisciplinary since its birth nearly 50 years ago. 
Kutzinski commented that this interdisciplinary perspective 
characterizes Americanist scholarship at Yale. Indeed, many of the 
Americanists who work in the English department analyze 
literature and other forms of artistic expression under the 
theoretical rubric currently called "cultural studies" in the academic 
realm. 

Not everyone has been using this framework. Describing 
himself as "old-fashioned," Whitaker explained his discomfort with 
cultural studies because he feels it represents a form of academic 
ideology that relies perhaps too heavily on theories of gender, race, 
sexuality, and class. He does not think of a novel as an object 
produced by its cultural context, but rather as a piece of art 
produced by an author. Yet some argue that cultural studies does 
not kill off the author. Instead, it analyzes not only what occurs 
within the text, but also what occurs without. Whitaker says his 
position is more closely related to formalism, a school of thought 
that examines the text independent of historical context. 

In contrast, Denning emphasized the absolute importance of a 
theoretical argument that makes a book of criticism relevant to 
several disciplines. In other words, he argued that the 
underpinnings of an article about late twentieth century Cuban 
race relations can spark the interest of a nineteenth century literary 
critic. 

The tension emerging between those who study 
literature from an interdisciplinary viewpoint and 
those with a more formal approach is probably more pervasive than 
some faculty and students are willing to admit. Although no one 
seems to think that interdisciplinary studies are under attack, 
Kutzinski commented, "Americanists who are in the English 
department are feeling a little marginalized." Furthermore, some 
American studies graduate students, especially those who study 
literature, feel that their methodology is considered especially 
strange. 

Debating definitions at length is itself a strange game. 
Essentially it misses the point. However this professorial assembly 
may choose to define Americanist-and whether they appropriate 
that label for themselves-what Yale students will come to know 
about America depends on the books put into the curriculum and 
the faculty members approved to teach them. But as the English 
department loses more of its American literature scholars faster 
than it can replace them, there are simply fewer courses being 
taught at both undergraduate and graduate levels in the field of 
American literature. R.W.B. Lewis (Honorary MA '60), perhaps 
one of the most eminent scholars on Edith Wharton and her work, 
recently retired from the English department. Brodhead, who 
teaches the popular lecture course on nineteenth-century American 
literature, became dean of Yale College in 1993. Hazel Carby has 
turned her critical eye away from literature and directed it towards 
the growing field of cultural studies. She also recently resigned 
from the English department, though she still maintains her 
tenured positions in American and African-American studies. 
Additionally, hiring more junior faculty to fill these spaces will not 
bridge the gap left by retirements and resignations. Junior faculty 
rarely teach at the graduate level, and thus their potential to 
mentor graduate students is limited. 

Repetition across syllabi is one reason that some Yale students 
perceive that there are not enough innovative courses on American
