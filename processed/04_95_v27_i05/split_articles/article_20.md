volunteers from neighborhoods through~ut 
the city. Once recruited, volunteers were 
~ent back to their respective neighborhoods 
with a profoundly simple message: "Here is 
the Modern Times. It is your vehicle." 
Joelle Fishman, one of the Modern 
Times' fjrst editors, remembers that she 
rarely wrote for the paper herself, even 
though she was one of the few involved 
with any journalistic experience. Instead, 
Fishman spent most of her time trying to 
get as many people in the community as 
possible to tell their stories in their own 
words. 

A strident article on the last page of the 
Modern Times' first issue tells the story of 
the .paper rather well. The article lauds 
karate as a method of self-defense. "Karate 
is unquestionably the most effective form of 
self-defense simply because it developed 
from an oppressed group of people and has 
remained flexible from its formation," it 
begins. Similarly, the Modern Times aimed 
to radicalize an oppressed group of people 
and, at the beginning, it was anything if not 
flexible. All the newspaper had to .do was 
follow the article's well-learned set of karate 
ground rules. 
Avoid physical viounce as much as possibu 
maintaining an attitude of self-confidence 
(not cockiness). Note: A lit& untkrstanding 
and show of sincere concern for your 
adversary's situation can often avert disaster.

its policemen, the Modern Times tried to 
incite New Haven residents against the 
system. Its articles challenged official 
propaganda touting strong schools, clean 
air, adequate and comfortable housing, and 
other 
miracles 
of New 
Haven's 
"redevelopment." 

But the Modern Times was careful not to 
come across as too aggressive. AIM, whose 
members made up the core of the paper's 
staff, dreamed of becoming a paper for the 
working man, but it also wanted society at 
large tQ_ take it seriously. It steered clear of 
any connection with-communism, which 
might have caused people to condemn it 
automatically. "We chose the bland name of 
American 
Independent 
Movement 
intentionally," Wolff said. A more neutral 
name would make for a more inclusive 
group.

underestimate your assailant. An opening 
attack can be blocked, but for the 
inexperienced, side or back stepping to avoid 
the attack is most advisable. 

t the core of the Modern Times was a 
group of driven political activists. 
The paper aimed to create a "new 
awareness" in the city: to help people 
reclaim control of their lives from large 
corporations and an arrogant and aloof city 
government. "There is no place else," the 
paper declared, "where the hunger, bad 
housing and education, lack of health care, 
[and] police harassment that people live 
with is told by them." 

The establishment in New Haven, 
however, was deeply entrenched. New 
Haven's legendary mayor, Richard Lee 
(Honorary MA '61), on the campaign trail 
in 1951, said that New Haven's inability to 
cope with social problems resulted from the 
fact that: "There was no unity of 
approach." He would be the man to create 
that unity. In 1953 he was elected to the 
first of an unprecedented eight terms in 
office. From 1955 to 1967 he won 
reelection with an average plurality of 
15,000 votes, or roughly one-third of New 
Haven's voting population. And all this at a 
time when voter turnout in the city was 
nearly 70 percent. 

It was, in effect, the death of the two 
party system in New Haven. By 1965, all 
33 New Haven aldermen were Democrats. 
With federal dollars streaming in at a per 
capita rate second only ro Philadelphia, 
Mayor Lee and his all-star cast of city 
planners won national fame for their 
"Model City." The Board of Aldermen itself 
appeared to be rather like an anachronistic 
remnant from a more democratic era, 
enacting Lee's bloated budgets with no 
questions asked. It was around this time, 
recalls former New Haven mayor Frank 
Logue (BK '48, LAW '5 1), that the 
Democratic Party chairman Arthur Barbieri 
(UGRD '38) began to boast that he could 
take people off the street and get them 
elected mayor. Mayor Lee, it appeared, had 
achieved his "unity of approach" in grand 
fashion. 


Lee gave voice to widely held sentiment 
when he declared in 196 5, after the 
completion of the Wooster Square project, 
"The transformation of New Haven into a 
modern American city is well underway, 
and its successful completion is certain." 

The city had amassed upwards of $30 
million in federal redevelopment grants by 
this time. How could it go wrong? 

Critical voices somehow failed to ftlter 
through the cocktail and dinner 
engagements Barbieri arranged for 
aldermen prior to redevelopment meetings. 
Yale's prophets of modernity, in league with 
high-powered city planners, preached the 
doctrine of redevelopment while New 
Haveners listened and watched in awe. The 
Democratic Party began to function, in 
Logue's words, as "a closed enterprise," out 
of touch with many of the city's 
communities. Thus, when riots erupted in 
the city's black neighborhoods in August of 
1967, it is little wonder that Mayor Lee had 
nothing to say to a reporter other than, "I 
seriously thought it wouldn't happen." 

After the riots, anxiety mounted in the 
city as to whether this kind of leadership 
would be enough to reverse New Haven's

troubling trends. It was clearly time for a 
new public voice to be heard. There could 
be no more side-stepping the city 
government's misguided initiatives. Even 
the staunchly conservative Rt-gisttr-which 
according to Modnn Timts publisher Matt 
Borenstein had a policy of never printing 
pictures of striking laborers to avoid 
indirectly aiding their cause-ran an article 
in which local black leaders criticized the 
Lee administration. "I am not convinced 
that 'more of the same' is the answer," 
cautioned executive" director of the Urban 
League of Greater New Haven, Robert 
Boles. 

Still, it wasn't until three years later, 
with the publication of the Motkrn Timts, 
that the dark side to New Haven's 
"Progress" began to be revealed in a 
systematic outpouring of unedited, 
unadulterated anger. And even then, for 
every inexperienced volunteer that the 
paper attracted, the Democratic machine 
had a slew of loyal followers on the 
patronage dole.

ccording to Wolff, the Modnn Timts 
never could have come into being 
:without the leadership AIM 
provided. Still, at the same time that AIM 
was lifting off the ground, other groups 
were forming in New Haven to voice 
frustration about a wide range of issues. As 
awareness grew about the relationship 
between these events, AIM members came 
together with members of the other groups 
in an agreement to provide mutual support. 
It was the synergy created by this union that 
would give the Modtrn Timts such a 
powerful, well-informed voice. 

The paper's range of coverage was 
nothing less than astonishing. Yes, there 
were some pedantic, structural type stories, 
such as the one in which Rick Wolff 
attempted to persuade the reader that the 
city's debt payment should be construed as 
welfare for the rich because banks and 
corporations were not required to pay 
income taxes on any interest they earned 
from loans to the city. But overall, the 
paper's headlines read like graffiti taken 
from walls all over the city. 

When he heard of several instances 
where the police had picked up kids with 
litde or no justification, Reverend Larry 
Reilly wrote an article in the Modnn Timts 
alleging polke harassment. The piece 
concluded with a bitterly sarcastic, if 
ungrammatical, warning to the city's youth 
(particularly those living in Fair Haven, 
who he felt were victimized more than the 
rest for their race): "In short, watch out, 
kids, no matter where you live and stay 
home (after all there is no decent recreation 
in Fair Haven for you), and you will be 
arrested for even talking quietly on a street 
corner. , 

An article entitled "People Create New 
Parks" told of a rally held by the People's 
Associarion of Williams Street to complain 
that some one hundred children in their 
neighborhood had no nearby playground. 
In a photo stretched beside the article 
mothers and children were shown having a 
picnic in an overgrown lot near an overpass. 
The lot was surrounded by a chain link 
23 

fence with a sign that read: "State property. 
No trespassing." 

On the paper's Spanish page, included 
in each issue for the benefit of the city's 
growing Latino population, an employee of 
the Yale University Dining Halls told of the 
racism she had witnessed a manager display 
towards an African-American employee. 
The article, entitled "Mi Experiencia del 
Sistema del Yale," concludes with a 
statement about the attitude of Yale towards 
the city which any reader of the Mod~rn 
Times would come ro hear over and over. 
"These same bosses of the university treat 
the whole community with disdain," wrote 
the employee. 

Regardless of your tactic you must 
maintain strong footing and balance to prottct 
youruif properly; b~ able to move; and to 
provide strength for your counterattack. 

he Modem Tim~s lived up to its vow 
to counteract the prejudiced 
information disseminated by the 
establishment. For example, New Haven 
police may have nodded agreement with the 
alarmist assessment of FBI direcror J. Edgar 
Hoover that: "The Black Panther Party 
without question represents the greatest 
threat to the internal security of the 
country." But the Modern Tim~s told 
another story. 

Countering the perception of the Black 
Panthers as nothing more than a belligerent, 
militaristic organization, the staff told of 
free clinics and breakfast programs for the 
kids of working mothers, opened and 
operated by Black Panthers in New Haven. 
Emphasizing class distinctions over those of 
race, the newspaper praised the Panther 
rallying cry of "All power to the people" as a 
slogan for all working men. 

When the city began leveling, one by 
one, several hotels which had served as 
housing for people with modest incomes, it 
said it was doing a good thing by removing 
the old to make way for the new. But the 
Modern Times-by sending its reporters 
into the dusty hallways of the hotels- . 
discovered another, radically different view. 
Under the headline, "City Scatters 
Strand Community," the paper told of a 
unique community of elderly New 
Haveners who had lived happily for 
upwards of 10 years in the Strand Hotel 
.until .they were evicted by the city. A photo 
captured 
the 
residents 
lol}nging 
comfortably in the hotel's lobby. Many were 
afraid of the prospect of'moving into an 
apartment full of strangers. "I think the city 
delights in breaking up communities," said 
Harry Cornwall, a resident of the hotel for 
15 years. "They have no feeling for the 
people." 

Have a target in mind when you attack. If 
you strike aimlessly. you can hit someone many 
times without having any immediate effict; 
one carefully placed blow can stop an 
opponent. 

here was one issue which the Modern 
Times addressed more than the rest, 
and that was the crucial question of 
whether the city's redevelopment schemes 
were saving the city or contributing to its 
decline. It was becoming apparent by 1970 
that Mayor Lee's legendary redevelopment 
program had in fact been just that-legend. 
Between 1950 and 1970, 10,000 housing 
units were bulldozed and 7,819 households 
relocated in the hopes that something more 
sightly and, above aJI, with pockets deep 
enough for the payment of property taxes, 
would spring up in their place. In most 
cases, nothing ever did. 

There is some irony in the fact that the
