Perhaps there is no sex at Yale, but no 
one can accuse Yalies of lacking in 
conversation. After four hours of chatting 
in Kate's common room, my thighs are 
beginning to leave a permanent imprint in 
the brown vinyl of her Salvation Army sofa. 
Tonight's conversation has run the usual 
gamut of topics, from classes and professors 
to significant (or insignificanr) ochers. 
Topics nor unusual for two people who 
balance precariously on the line between 
acquaintances and friends, who chat when 
rhey cross paths on Old Campus and 
always say they will call bur rarely take the 
time to dial. 

So I am mildly surprised when our 
conversation about women's groups on 
campus leads to a more heated topic: 
feminism. Warning signs flash in my head 
like an air-raid siren, but I push them away 
effortlessly. After having this conversation 
countless rimes, my friend's comments will

undoubtedly be no more than the 
annoying buzz of a fly trapped berween the 
screen and the windowpane. I have become 
an expert at swatting feminist flies. 

I look into Kate's eyes, all innocence 
framed by mousy eyeglasses and a blunt 
strip of schoolgirl's bangs. Definitely not

decide to get right down co business. Why 
extend a conversation when I could knock 
Kate down and be our of here before we hit 
round three? 

''I'm for women's rights, bur I don't call 
myself a feminist," I say. "I consider myself 
an equalise." My voice rakes on a slightly 
self-righteous tone. Surely Kate has never 
been exposed co this position on the issue. 
Kate smiles in a way I int~rpret as 
timid. "You don't want to discuss chis with 
me." She waves her hand shyly. "I have 
very strong feelings about the matter." 

Did I say she waved her hand shyly? 
Her gesture now seems more akin to the 
shooing away of a bothersome mosquito. 
But I refuse to metamorphose from prize-
fighter to annoying insect this quickly. 

I calmly explain to her in very 
measured tones that rhe term feminist no 
longer has the same meaning that it did 
during the feminist movement 30 years 
ago, but my heart begins its own Kentucky 
Derby at the thought that I might actually
