EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Zvika Blum, Elqana's engineer and "city planner, looked understandably 
surprised when I showed up in his office. I had wandered into 
Elqana's municipal building looking for anyone who spoke enough 
English to tell me about the settlement. I must have been, to him, an odd 
sight: a Christian Filipino, spending spring break in Israel, who had come to 
write about a Jewish settlement on the West Bank for an American college 
magazine. 

He welcomed me with an unexpected warmth. Blum assumed that I 
had come all the way from the United States because I wanted to study at 
the university he was building. "Wait! How much time do you have?" he 
asked me. "Come, I'll take you on a tour of the town." He bundled me into 
his car and drove me around the settlement. Blum had designed much of 
Elqana himself and seemed to take pleasure in showing his visitor the fruits 
of his labor. 

Throughout his tour I tried my best to disabuse Zvika of his misconcep-
tions about my visit. He finally understood, but proudly continued to point 
out things like the town's manicured mini-park and brand-new high school, 
built with government funds. Coming down a hill, where "we could see a 
nice view," he said, of the rolling country around Elqana, and the minarets 
of an Arab town nearby, I asked him what will happen to Elqana now that 
the Labor government has said it will stop funding the settlements. "We 
won't be worse off than before," he said, and shrugged, as if to say living in 
Elqana was enough of a challenge. 


My visit to Elqana brought revelations (in a land thoroughly bound up 
with revelations). I did discover, despite UNH's decision to abandon its 
planned campus, that construction had not stopped in the settlement. 
Beyond that, I gained an insight into a concealed universe; one structured 
by different rules and suffused with political tensions and daily struggles. 
The New journal has built its reputation partly on revelations. We don't 
get scoops often, but we can and do cast old things in a new light. We strive 
to reveal new and candid perspectives on how people live their lives, and the 
issues they confront. In this magazine, Kate Brewster shows us how some of 
the world's best boats are built, as well as the man who builds them, and 
Ellen Barry speaks frankly about college trysts. As revelations often bring 
more questions than answers, we here at TNJ consider producing a maga-
zine a continual learning experience. In putting together this issue, we have 
shown how widely dispersed articles on Yale and New Haven can be, by 
wandering as far afield in time and space-as World War II or the West Bank. 
We thank the seniors and juniors who are moving on, who have caught 
us much of what we know, and whom we are proud to call our friends: 
Sarah, Kathy, Emily, Charlotte, Tina, Jen, Katie, Erik, and Kate. We thank 
as well our Board of Directors, without whose continued support, friend-
ship, and concern for the magazine we could not do what we do well. 
We also invite all interested in learning with us the business of revelation 
to come and plan our next issue. Would-be writers, businesspeople, graphic 
designers, artists, and photographers should write this down on their calen-
dars: "TNJ meeting-Monday, April 19, at 7:45 P.M. in the Berkeley 
Seminar Room." We hope to see you there.
