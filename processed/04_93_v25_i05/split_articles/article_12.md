During Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.'s (TO '53) losing 1988 campaign for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate, his Democratic opponents labeled him a "sleeping bear." His lengthy tenure in Washington, they insinuated, had made him comfortable with the status quo. Little did they expect that cwo years later, Weicker would roar back to life as the head of a party he founded himself, A Connecticut Party (ACP), co become Connecticut's first third-party governor in nearly 150 years. ACP's success constituted a challenge to traditional two-party politics. 

Yet both Republicans and Democrats dismiss ACP, calling the organization more a personality cult centered around Weicker than a viable political force. Weicker's new political coalition suited the anti-two-party feeling engulfing the country. Invigorated by Weicker's engaging personality, ACP built its platforms out of planks from both parties. The party stresses the Republican view that business is the key to Connecticut's growth yet also emphasizes traditionally Democratic concerns such as education and civil rights. ACP's Statement of Principles dedicates the party to "overcoming political entrenchmept" and providing "the leadership to guide Connecticut."

Critics doubt ACP's lofty principles, considering the parry the product of Weicker's political scrambling. A former Republican, Weicker left his posicion as law professor at George Washington University to jump into Connecticut's gubernatorial contest after both Democrat and Republican slots had been filled. Even if he had announced his candidacy earlier, his pro-choice stance and refusal to support Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination would have made it difficult to convince his former party to welcome him back.

Ed Marcus, the Democratic state parry chair, called Weicker's decision to found ACP "a shrewd political maneuver." But Republicans see Weicker's move as a direct attack on his former party. Republican state party chair Dick Foley believes the ACP was "one man's vengeance" against the party that criticized his performance in the U.S. Senate.

According to Weicker, however, Republican discontent had nothing to do with his decision. Traditional two-party gridlock led him to choose a third way. Upon announcing his entry into the race early in March 1990, Weicker exclaimed, "How about deregulating politics? Let's have some competition." An independent party, Weicker said, would be able to "handle the tough problems" that the two other parties neglect.


Weicker's party, ACP, according to party statistics, has grown surprisingly large in just two years. Party supporters today range from converted Republicans to disenchanted Democrats, a coalition that exists largely because of Weicker and his no-nonsense approach to thj economy. The extensive grass roots organization, which claims to bring honesty and issues back to politics, has effected some change in Connecticut. ACP fielded a number of its own candidates in the 1992 elections and endorsed many candidates from the two major parties. Not one of the ACP candidates won, although many received up to 25 percent of the vote.

Regardless of the disappointing election returns, ACP believes it exerted influence on state politics. The party claims that several of the cross candidates, including Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), owe their victories to the support of ACP. ACP has already begun preparing for the 1994 elections.

Connecticut Democrats and Republicans are not nearly as optimistic about the party's future. One anonymous Democratic leader said, "There are 738,000 Democrats in Connecticut, 504,000 Republicans and only 1,770 official members of the ACP. So what do you think?"

Republican Foley agrees that ACP support is weak, particularly if Weicker decides to retire from politics. "It is a personality cult, not a political party," Foley said. Weicker's presence pervades ACP, even though he holds no formal position within the organization. Party newsletters often contain a personal "Message from the Governor," and pamphlets attracting new members include a letter from Weicker. In addition, Foley contends that Weicker's 1990 winning campaign drew heavily from the political disillusionment in the country at the time. "It was chic to be independent," he said. ACP's lone victory with Weicker supports the bipartisan criticism. Though ACP refutes the assumption that Weicker alone holds the party together, it will take national and state election victories to convince critics.

ACP supporters point to the party's rapid growth and the accompanying national attention as proof positive that the party is here to stay, even though these achievements rest largely on Weicker's economic successes. When Weicker ran for governor, Connecticut had nearly a $1 billion deficit. Once in office, he instituted an income tax, the first in the state's history, which met a barrage of criticism. Weicker's popularity plummeted to around 20 percent.

Tough medicine, however, had quick results. At the end of Weicker's first year in office, Connecticut's deficit had turned into a roughly $30 million surplus. Weicker's approval rating jumped to nearly 50 percent by the end of 1992. Connecticut's turnaround appears to support Weicker's argument that the two traditional parties are more skilled at battling each other than in solving the nation's problems.

Ross Perot's emergence in the last presidential election underscores the possible impact a third party can have on the national level. Weicker himself has been involved in efforts to establish a national third party. This is the only option, he believes, "that's going to straighten out both politics and government." Weicker, however, has dismissed any rumors of running for president under a national third party-an idea that resulted from his prominent involvement in the new movement. Downplaying any national aspirations, ACP chair Diane Blick surmised, "We are, after all, the Connecticut Party."

How long A Connecticut Party can last without its popular creator remains in question. Weicker may not seek another term as governor in 1994. If he chooses not to run, or is defeated in a reelection effort, ACP may disintegrate as quickly as it emerged. IIIJ
