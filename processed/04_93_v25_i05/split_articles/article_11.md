Watching the Hillhouse High School mock trial 
team in action is like watching those feisty, artic-
ulate lawyers on L.A. Law. Following their 
Hollywood counterparts, these teenage litigators intimidate 
when eros-examining, object dramatically (and far more 
often than any real-life attorney), and even mutter under 
their breaths discontentedly when they disagree with a 
judge's ruling. Such courtroom procedure seems to come 
naturally to them, thanks to weeks of practice, which pre-
pare them for almost any situation. If the unexpected does 
come their way, they take it in stride, relying on the 
melange of spontaneity and poise that has propelled this 
inner-city New Haven high school team to three state 
championships. 

Pitted against Hillhouse's razor-sharp attorneys and 
slithery witnesses, most opponents quickly become victims, 
a process that can turn ugly as Hillhouse recognizes and 
toys with their weaknesses. Last year, 
Leigh Roberts, then a sophomore at 
Hillhouse, turned the tables of tradi-
tional trial control on a hapless oppos-
ing attorney as she, playing a witness, 
forced him to waste five of his seven 
allotted cross-examination minutes 
reviewing the definition of "drink" in 
her affidavit. A Hillhouse attorney 
once objected to 15 consecutive ques-
tions, and when the judge sustained 
each and every time, opposing counsel 
found itself without an argument. 
"The team will learn the law and 
courtroom procedure. But the object 
is to win," Coach Allen Grenet says of 
the competition that combines debat-
ing skills with a knowledge of the law. 
"Everybody is hungry for blood," 
Leigh says. 

Tonight, March 16, is no exception, as Hillhouse 
expects to tear apart a fledgling team from Platt High 
School in its second match of the regional tournament. 
Platt cannot hide its rookie status, misunderstanding 
judges' instructions and neglecting basics like approaching 
the bench when introducing evidence. Still, Hillhouse has 
trouble sealing a victory, for Platt's inexperience bogs down 
the trial. Rather than capitalizing on its superiority, 
Hillhouse seems to sink to its opponent's level. Lawyers

miss opportunities to object; witnesses struggle with the 
inappropriate questions that arise as a consequence. 
Somewhere in the gallery, one parent whispers to another: 
"You should have seen them last year." 

During the 1992 season, Hillhouse reached the top, 
and 
then kept climbing. 
After winning 
Connecticut's tournament, the team went on to 
beat the New York state champions in the bi-state competi-
tion, which effectively marked it the best of the two states' 
673 participating schools. Hillhouse also took the gold in 
1986 and 1987, but last year was the first time it did so as a 
magnet team. Since 1991, Hillhouse has drawn participants 
from a number of schools around New Haven, and some 
other teams cite this as an unfair advantage. This year the 
squad of seven students breaks down into three from 
Hillhouse, two from Wilbur Cross, and two from Amity. 

By this time last year, the team had been rehearsing 
entire trials for weeks. This season, however, they barely 
reached that polished stage. Because the team comprises 
only veteran competitors, Coach Grenet relaxed his notori-
ous five-day-a-week practice regimen, a decision he has 
come to question now that he has seen his team srruggle in 
the tournament. In January, teams received a case dealing 
with a hypothetical mugging. Competition organizers pro-
vided maps, footprints, medical records, and affidavits. 
Over the next two months, Hillhouse's three lawyers used

the materials to formulate questions, 
while the four witnesses gradually 
assumed their assigned characters. In 
competition-a simulated trial that 
lasts about two hours-
the seven stu-
dents represent either prosecution or 
defense, depending on the flip of a 
coin. Three judges, usually local prac-
ticing attorneys, officiate the trial and 
award the points that determine the 
victor. 

The team's abnormally low level of 
preparation may come from disap-
pointment with the assigned case; 
compared to previous scenarios, like 
last year's battle over AIDS patients 
occupying a home in a resistant neigh-
borhood, the theft of $35 does not 
offer much intellectual fodder. "Other 
years we examined our own views as 
we practiced," says Cross senior Sasha 
Sanberg-Champion. "This year it 
seems like just a few facts on paper. 
There's not much there." 

It is this reaching beyond given 
information that has set Hillhouse 
apart from other teams in the past. By 
going to the experts, they acquaint 
themselves with an issue more thor-
oughly than competitors, and often 
more thoroughly than the judges. This 
year they spoke to detectives of the 
New Haven police, who explained fin-
gerprinting, footprint analysis, and 
crime-scene procedure. For the AIDS 
case, they went to epidemiologists. 
"Our expert witness knew so much 
about the epidemic that she could teach 
doctors," asserts Coach Grenet. 

Knowledge of the law comes counesy of 
dedicated attorneys who volunteer 
with the team several times a week, 
and while all schools officially have 
such advisers, most teams meet with 
theirs only a few times immediately 
before the tournament. This discrep-
ancy manifests itself clearly during 
competition, when Hillhouse may 
make a pre-trial motion or take excep-
tion, baffling opponents who still 
grapple with terms like Miranda 
rights. 

Leaving most· legal matters to 
advisers Beth Merkin and Karen 
Goodrow, both New Haven public 
attorneys, Coach Grenet considers 
himself a theatrical director. Stand up 
straight, no "urns," think before you 
speak, he insists. A Hillhouse history 
teacher forever clad in a blue "1992 
Mock Trial State Champions" jacket, 
Coach Grenet gnaws nervously on a 
stopwatch during practice, white-
knuckled hands mercilessly gripping 
his desk. When practices give way to 
compeuuon, 
his 
apprehension 
explodes into outright panic. Years ago 
the team complained that his neurotic 
behavior harmed their performance, so 
now he exits the courtroom after 
opening statements. Every half hour or 
so he returns for an update, temples 
moist with perspiration, eyes bulging 
with worry, palm meeting forehead to 
punctuate his anguish. 

Two hours into the trial against 
Platt, Coach Grenet comes 
into the gallery for the fourth 
time and introduces a new concern: 
points. To advance to the quarterfi-
nals, Hillhouse must win both of two 
regional matches, and since more than 
one team may meet this requirement, 
Hillhouse must also tally the most 
total points. At the moment, however, 
Hillhouse does not even know for sure 
if it won last week against Hamden-
results of both regional trials are post-
. ed after the second to discourage los-
ing teams from throwing in the towel 
after the first. Although team members 
and observers feel fairly confident that 
Hillhouse won the first match, noth-
ing calms the coach. Grenet has been 
circulating through other courtrooms, 
and he has concluded that some other 
teams have been racking up points at a 
dangerous pace. 

But so has Hillhouse. For the last 
two witnesses there has been no ques-
tion of who controls the action in this 
crowded room in the New Haven 
Superior Courthouse. Under relentless 
interrogation by Hillhouse's Crissa 
Klein, a senior at Amity, a Platt wit-
ness contradicts his own testimony. 
While the judges continue to see that 
ostensibly sweet smile on Crissa's face, 
the audience can see her clenching her 
hands behind her back, evidence of 
her nor-so-sweet intent to exploit the 
error. The difference in the two 
schools' experience takes on farcical 
proportions during closing statements. 
Representing Hillhouse, Sasha stands 
assuredly in front of the bench while 
captivating onlookers with lingo and
