This writing is meant as a reminder to myself as much as it is to 
each of you. There was something abour the anger at the 
Beinecke rallies last April that was refreshing. But to what end? 
((yale is New Haven and New Haven is Yale!" 
Voices of anger lifted up a resounding cry from 
the pavement of Yale's campus last spring. 
Hundreds of students gathered on Beinecke Plaza to vent 
their rage and disgust at the oppression which still infects 
this country, and to agitate for change. The police officers 
who had savagely beaten black motorist Rodney King had 
been acquitted, and Los Angeles was on fire. 
For so many of us who come from communities where

urban blight and violence are a part of the everyday land-
scape, what happened in Los Angeles was not a surprise. 
The riots were a predictable result of too much poverty and 
too little justice. The verdict fanned an already raging fire 
by reinforcing the perception that the legal system does not 
work for those who do not have the resources to manipulate 
its decisions. 
Some of my Yale classmates were caught off guard by 
the riots, and in various discussions they showed that they 
did not understand the basic roots of the upheaval. The 
shock that many Yale students felt revealed a basic igno-
rance-there is violence in South Central, and throughout 
our country, every day. I did not expect or want approval of

this pillage and Qestruction, but I was 
disturbed that some of the nation's 
supposedly most promising future 
leaders did not recognize that oppres-
sion often leads to revolt. 
The violence inflicted upon 
Rodney King was emblematic of what 
is happening to this nation's children. 
As Marian Wright Edelman, director 
of the Children's Defense Fund, said 
when she spoke at Yale this March: for 
many children, home, school, and 
most places in between have become 
warzones. How can a child concen-
trate on algebra when she or he is terri-
fied of being shot? Too many of our 
children are beaten down by the con-
ditions of their environments before 
they can discover the heights of their 
potential. The death of an innocent 
South Central child is such a common 
occurence that it tends not to receive 
much attention. Because of that lost 
promise, we all suffer. 
How can a child 
concentrate on algebra 
when she or he is 
terrified of being shot? 
Before the riots, the rampant 
crime that South Central residents 
faced daily appeared to be contained. 
The riots, and particularly the beating 
of another innocent-white motorist 
Reginald Denny shattered this illusion 
and provoked a national outcry. To all 
sympathetic human beings the inci-
dent was repulsive. But white America 
was especially terrified. The car once 
seemed to be an inviolate space. Safely 
inside their vehicles, suburbanites can 
pass through and around urban blight 
without stopping, without ever look-
ing back. The beating of Reginald 
Denny symbolized the possibility that 
white Americans could be ensnared in 
this violence. The potential for injury

was suddenly too close to home ... it 
was time to call in the National 
Guard. 
Y
ale has historically existed 
under a similar illusion of 
containment. Only recently, it 
seems, has the university opened its 
eyes to the city with which it is inextri-
cably linked. New Haven suffers many 
of the same problems which led to the 
revolt in L.A. The students who were 
?n Beinecke Plaza recognized that 
what happened in Los Angeles could 
have taken place in New Haven given 
a similar set of circumstances. These 
students expressed their concerns to 
Yale alumni, who were holding a kick-
off assembly for the university's $1.5 
billion fundraising campaign. A set of 
demands were issued which stressed 
the university's obligation to give back 
significantly to New Haven. The list 
of demands called for Yale to initiate 
and upgrade programs which would 
encourage job training and offer 
greater support to places like the 
Dixwell Q House, and to exert more 
energy in celebrating Yale's multicul-
tural community with the establish-
ment of a mandatory freshperson ori-
entation on this topic. 
A year has passed and, as always, 
memories fade and emotions once 
expressed passionately, lose their fire. 
What became of the demands made 
on Beinecke and the energy which 
forced them to be articulated? 
Of course, there are those who 
were working to make a difference 
before the beating of Rodney King and 
who continue to do so today. Their 
efforts make it easier for others to fol-
low in their footsteps. The L.E.A.P. 
program enables college students to 
-Jive in New Haven's housing develop-
ments while leading children in a com-
prehensive program of education and 
recreation. This program is a model 
for the nation-right in our backyard. 
There are also student tutoring pro-
grams such as UIC, BRANCH and 
TIES, AYA Community Service 
Fellowships, and opportunities to be a 
Dwight Hall Summer intern. 
As Alderman Mike Morand (D-
1) stated in a recent speech, the uni-
versity itself has created programs that 
point in the right direction. "The 
Medical School has taken a leading 
role in school reform and in fighting 
AIDS, lead poisoning, tuberculosis, 
and infant mortality," he said. "The 
Architecture School requires all first-
yea.r students to participate in a com-
