EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
tonight." The freshman girls who 
waited for calls have become seniors 
who coolly tell young men not to 
bother. Dianne's theory goes this way: 
her love life here has foundered lately, 
but someday she will meet someone, 
and sexual experience will come in 
handy. "I see it all as educating 
myself," she says. 

The rules of the game have 
changed accordingly. As seniors, these 
women focus more on underclassmen, 
whom they describe as "reverent." As 
an ingenuous freshman, Dianne "was 
definitely getting picked up," she says, 
and the biggest shift now lies in "who's 
calling the shots." They buy their own 
condoms, these women, and sexual 
intimidation is not high on their list of 
worries. "I feel like I pounced on this 
boy last night," one of them tells me, 
looking sheepish, pulling a bathrobe 
close around her. "I left his head spin-
ning." There is less pressure involve..d 
now, less loss of footing, says Natalie. 
Lately, hooking up is less of a seduc-
tion, she adds. "I only do it when I 
really want to." 

Because when we got here, 18: 
year-olds, we were more or less borne 
along by events. All that year we 
walked the edge between disaster and 
beautiful credulity. Our first nights 
were heart-stopping, volatile: an older

boy leaned over like he was drinking 
from a water fountain and ended up, 
astonishingly, kissing us. He said he 
liked us; we said, "Don't lie to me." 
We were routinely amazed at the rum of 
events; he walked us home at sunrise 
and bought doughnuts. Nothing has 
ever been so good, we wrote in our jour-
nals, if we still kept them. I love his hair, 
we wrote. It was uncharted ground. 

On a balcony, against a wall, at a 
billiard hall on Chapel Street, these 
were the first nights of new lives. They 
_were chancy. They were frightening. 
My first night sticks with me on the 
strength of one image: I am not used 
to drinking; I am almost unconscious; 
this man I do not know is unbutton-
ing my shirt and my head hits the end 
of his bed loudly. He asks me if I am 
all right and I can still hear him laugh-
ing. Were you ever afraid? I ask Alice. 
Yes, she says. There was one time 
when I had to yell "Get the fuck off 
me," she says. "And he didn't get off." 

My friends have been through 
it-the hand around the wrist, the 
hollow leavetaking-and they are 
exhausted with the effort of self-
defense. "I feel totally in control," says 
one friend, and she means that she has 
reduced it to a system. She setS bound-
aries, she expects little, she knows what 
she wants and castS her net no farther. 
Natalie's preagreed contracts include 
not only sexual limits, but a walk 
home afterwards. These girls are lucid 
and deliberate and bulletproof. The 
dangerous plunge of freshman year-
the crapshoot-is eliminated, and so, 
strangely, is most of the appeal. "I look 
back fondly" on the procession of 
warm, unknown men, "but I wouldn't 
want it anymore," Natalie says. "We've 
all found that it just gets less satisfy-
ing," says Alice. Eagerness is a quality 
that gets you into trouble, and if we 
regret its passing then we do it from 
the safe vantage of maturity. Still there 
is something lost-the hand in my 
pocket-the years when possibility 
constructed itself even in the muddy 
yard of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

imagine.
