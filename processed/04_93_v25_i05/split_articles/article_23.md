Discussion of changes at Yale often gravitates toward 
the 60s, with images of hippie students and 
tenured radicals. But by the late 1940s, post-war 
realities had already begun to alter 250 yews ofYale elitism, 
as ex-soldiers in fatigues sat in class next to navy-blazered 
prep school graduates. The freshman class of 1946 was the 
largest in Yale's history, included more public-school gradu-
ates than the university had ever had, and began a lasting 
liberalization ofYale. 

Behind Yale's post-war transformation was the GI Bill 
of Rights, part of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act. With 
this legislation, the U.S. Government agreed to pay for four 
years of college for all returning soldiers. Yale patriotically 
accepted as many of the ex-soldiers it could squeeze in, even 
housing some students on cots in Payne Whitney 
Gymnasium and in specially built huts around New Haven. 

Congress p~sed the GI Bill in 1944 to ease the coun-
try's shift into peace time. Instead of having thousands of 
unemployed soldiers trying to find work all at once, Uncle 
Sam sent the servicemen to college. American universities 
faced a sudden flood of students. Yale's enrollment increased 
by 60 percent. In 1945, there were 257 people in the fresh-
man class at Yale. In 1946, the freshman class burgeoned to 
an astounding 1,767 students. 

These statistics may be misleading, since during the 
confusion of World War II, Yalies often switched classer. 
For example, Reverend Harry Adams (BK '48), now the 
master of Trumbull College, entered Yale in the summer of 
1942 expecting to graduate in 1945 through Yale's acceler-
ated year-round war programs. Adams was called into ser-
vice in February 1943, returned to Yale with some of the 
first released soldiers in October 1945, and finally graduat-
ed in January 1948. His case was not unusual. 

"By the spring of '43, there were almost no civilians left 
at Yale," Adams recaJled. He estimated that 90% of his class 
left for active duty in the war. The a1my and navy stationed 
training programs at Yale, housing soldiers on Old Campus 
and in all but three of the residential colleges. After the war, 
Yale's policy was to "accept anyone who had been here under 
any program," Adams said. The classes entering in 1945 and 
1946 included not only many students new to the Ivy League, 
but also five years' worth of backlogged Yale students and 
those who had come here for army and navy training. "It 
began to be a very complex and diverse place," Adams said. 

The aftermath of World War II shaped the Yale that 
students know today. Before the war, a three-room suite 
held two people. After 1946, the same suite, now with army-
style bunkbeds, held four. "Yale has never gone back to the 
space it had before," Adams said. 

College dining halls typified the changing Yale. Before the 
war, students wore ties and jackets to dinner, sat at tables with 
linen table-cloths, ordered from printed menus, and were 
served by waiters and waitresses. After the war, rhe new crowds 
forced dining halls to change "from restaurant-style to army-
style," according to Larry Schafer (TC '47). Students waited in 
long cafeteria lines and ate from metal trays identical to rhe 
ones they had used in the army. "Jackets became customary 
rather than obligatory," said Harrold Parritz (SM '49). 

The revolution in dress code was nor confined to the dining 
halls. "Some of the returning soldiers still wore their GI-issue 
clothes, at least for the first year," Schafer said. "They often were 
too poor to buy new clothes. There was something of a clothing 
shortage after the war, and army clothes were good clothes." 

But Yale had more pressing concerns than dinner dress to 
worry about. To house roughly 200 married Yale students and 
their families, Yale built special quonset huts-half-dome 
structures with a living room, kitchen and bedroom, near the 
Yale Bowl and at the present sire of the Pierson-Sage garage. 
Other married students (25 percent ofthe class of 1950) found 
off-campus housing. George Bush (DC '48), for instance, lived 
with his wife Barbara and 40 other people in crowded quarters 
at 37 Hillhouse Ave. 

As the average age of graduating seniors rose from 21 to 23, 
marriage became only one index of maturity. "Many of those 
men had three or four years of violence behind them," said 
Bradford Wright (SM '49). Some of the returning soldiers suf-
fered from battle fatigue, Schafer said, but few manifested 
overt problems. People before 1946 referred to students as 
"Yale boys." With the barrie-forged class that entered in 1946, 
people began to speak of "Yale men." 

The ex-Gis generally earned higher GPAs than the 
younger students, according to a 1946 Ya/~ Daily N~ws. 
"Having had experiences outside of academics, we were clearer, 
more focused," Adams said. Older and sometimes less privi-
leged than typical Yalies, many Gls were also more conscious 
of the need to find a job after graduation. Leon Blum (BK '50) 
said the veterans "brought a more serious approach to college 
than there had been in the past. Gut courses didn't attract the 
vets. They were interested in learning. trying to get as much as 
they could our of college." 

Schafer, who first entered Yale in 1938, disagreed, despite the 
statistics. "Some of those guys who got in on the GI Bill might
