T
he West Bank settlement of Elqana is booming. 

Surrounded by cool rolling country, the town's 
freshly painted houses sit among piles of earth and 
construction equipment. Fifty more housing units will join 
a recently finished synagogue on the west side of town, 
while to the north, a branch of a small women's university 
will soon boast new dormitories. Carefully laid out, Elqana 
attempts a proud semblance of peace and order, defying the 
turmoil and tensions of life on the West Bank. In the heart 
of Elkana lies the centerpiece of the town's ambitions: an 
assemblage of steel girders and concrete pillars that in a 
year, promised city engineer Zvika Blum, will become the 
University of New Haven's first overseas branch campus. 
For the 3,000 residents of Elqana, many of whom com- · 
mute daily to work in Tel Aviv 12 miles to the west, the line 
dividing Israel from the Israeli-occupied West Bank has practically ceased to exist. For UNH, however, the border has 
become a dangerous and disastrous line to cross. Criticized by 
many and supported by almost none for its decision to build a 
campus in occupied territory, UNH stumbled into a political 
nightmare with international repercussions. Jewish, Arab, and 
American organizations blasted UNH's surprising foray for 
legitimizing Israeli control of the West Bank, subverting U.S. 
policy, and supporting human-rights violations. "It started as 
an educational enterprise that got bound up in politics," said 
UNH President Lawrence J. DeN ardis. But only after enduring the storm of protest did UNH learn that in the West 
Bank, few enterprises can be anything but political. 

The journey that led UNH from its home in West 
Haven to a settlement on the West Bank started two years 
ago. Under the new DeNardis administration, the 72-year 
old university started looking into ventures abroad. 
Contacts between UNH faculty and Israeli educators had 
brought a deluge of Israeli students, who now comprise 
close to 20 percent of the foreign student population at 
UNH. Since the exodus of Israelis to UNH had been 
caused by a dearth of spaces at universities at home, UNH 
believed that Israel could be a perfect market for its educational product-an American college degree. "We said to 
ourselves, 'No one is doing it. We can do it,"' recalled 
DeN ardis. 

A covenant, forged early last year between UNH and 
the Bio-Technological Institute of Tel Aviv-an unaccredit-
ed two-year college that owns one of UNH's feeder schools 
in Israel, laid the foundation for UNH's overseas adventure. 
The Wingot family, which owns Bio-Tech, had even sent a 
member of the clan, Yehuda Wingot, to study at UNH. 
Bio-Tech offered UNH what seemed to be an ideal 
arrangement, one that would allow the university to reap 
the benefits of the vast market for higher education in 
Israel with minimal financial commitmeii't. 

Shouldering the bulk of the project's financial bur-
den, Bio-Tech would supply the funds to build what 
would be known as the HaSharon campus of UNH. Bio-
Tech planned to manage the campus and maintain its 
facilities. UNH, for its part in the bargain, would select 
faculty and students, construct curricula, and grant 
degrees in programs that ranged from engineering to 
restaurant management. In return, UNH would receive 
one percent of the tuition receipts or a minimum of 
$50,000 a year. With a· projected enrollment of 7,000 
students within three years, UNH could expect nearly $1 
million in revenues from the Israel campus. "It was strictly a question of business," said Joe DiMow, head of the 
New Haven chapter of New Jewish Agenda, a liberal group 
opposed to the plan. 

There was just one problem. The situation in Israel 
that made higher education so lucrative also made it 
extremely difficult for UNH to set up a campus inside the 
country's pre-1967 borders. Within Israel, a consortium of 
seven universities accredits new educational institutions, 
and seldom do they admit new members into their profitable club. "In effect," said DeNardis, "the consortium is a 
higher education cartel." The group of seven refused to 
grant accreditation to the UNH-Bio-Tech deal. The consortium's control could be circumvented-but only by 
building the HaSharon campus across the "Green Line," 
the border between Israel and the West Bank.

n most Israeli maps, the Green Line no longer 
appears. Ti'te physical distinction between Israel 
and the Occupied Territories has nearly vanished 
i.n some areas. The seamless green of the fields almost 
masks the political fault lines that divide Israel and the 
West Bank. Heading into the territories, however, one soon 
leaves behind the shabby, disorganized sprawls of old Israeli 
towns and starts to pass strikingly homogeneous arrays of 
freshly-painted homes that are the Jewish settlements in 
the Occupied Territories. 

Elqana was one of the fuse settlements in the Occupied 
Territories, built soon after the 1967 Six-Day War that gave 
Israel military control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. A 
former Jordanian military base now houses the town's municipal building. Although located close enough to the Green 
Line to escape much of the violence that grips the West Bank, 
Elqana is no Eden. Less than a year has passed since a 
Palestinian youth was killed close to the town. 

Many of the Jewish settlers have been moved by religious or political zealotry to brave the dangers of life in 
occupied land. Some settler groups, notably the Gush 
Emunim, want nothing less than the expulsion of all 
Palestinians from the Territories. Elqana, critics of the 
UNH plan claim, was settled by a Gush Emunim group. 
The presence of these extremist settlers represent, in some 
eyes, Israel's attempt to integrate forcibly the Occupied 
Territories. The political tensions between the Jewish settlers, who call the West Bank area Judea and Samaria, and 
the Arab populations, who consider the region occupied 
Palestine, have made violence the order of the day. The 
Jewish presence in the Occupied Territories has been so 
troublesome that many nations, including the U.S., consider a freeze on settlement activity a necessary precondition for a negotiated peace. 

"Israel is trying to create a situation," argued New Jewish 
Agenda's DiMow, "in which there would be no territory to 
return if they decided to return ir." Despite international 
opposition, the recently ousted Likud government in Israel 
openly encouraged the development of the settlements. The 
present construction boom in 
Elqana, in fact, owes its genesis to 
che generous coffers of the past 
administration. 

The Likud government readily 
bestowed its blessing on the 
UNH project. Zvulun Hammer, 
the education minister, granted 
UNH and Bio-Tech the necessary 
licenses to build in the territories. 
Settlers greeted the announce-
ment of the planned HaSharon 
campus with glee. Yechiel Leiter, . 
a spokesperson for the settlers' 
council, told United Press 
International, "The communities 
in Judea and Samaria have come 
of age." 

But when the Likud fell from 
grace in Israel last year, so did 
UNH. The new Labor government under Yitzhak Rabin 
ordered a hale to Jewish settlement in the West Bank. 
Hammer's successor, Shulamit Aloni, declared her resistance 
to the UNH plan, although she admitted she could not 
rescind the license issued by the past administration. 

Stymied in Israel, UNH suddenly found itself under 
siege in the United States as well. Once the plan became 
public knowledge in late November last year, political 
activists started to anack the UNH plan. The American-Arab
