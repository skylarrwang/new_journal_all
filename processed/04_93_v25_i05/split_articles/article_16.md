Hazel Carby has earned a ''cult foLLowing "at Yale. 
MRJL 16, 1993 
Marxist theories as a historical framework," she said. "They 
provide a tradition of a more equitable vision of society." 

When relations between graduate students and the admin-
istration became strained last year, Carby proved herself 
willing to put these academic beliefs into practice. She and 
11 ocher faculty members signed a petition co Yale's admin-
istration, asking the university co negotiate with striking 
graduate students. "Faculty who took the lead on speaking 
out were really courageous," said Gordon Lafer (GRD '94), 
a Graduate Employees Student Organization (GESO) lead-
er. "Hazel Carby earned a lot of graduate students' admira-
tion for her bravery." 

Carby believes that all students have a basic ~ight to 
representation. Born co a Jamaican father and a Welsh 
mother and raised in England, she spent her graduate stu-
dent years there, earning her doctoral degree in cultural 
studies at the Universiry of Birmingham. "I come from a 
country where students do have unions. In Europe, it is not 
assumed that a collective voice is antagonistic," she said. 

Carby is critical of the administration's attempts to preserve 
unequal power relations between faculty and graduate stu-
dents. "I am not interested in defending che university's sys-
tem of patronage. If the administration regards che students 
with terror," she said, "I am appalled by their terror." 

Carby has also earned praise for her work with Gerald 
Jaynes, the chairman of Afro-American studies, and other 
colleagues in the department to create a Ph.D program in 
Afro-American studies. Carby said that while race is under-
theorized in many ocher areas of the university, the Ph.D 
program will require core classes on the subject. The doc-
coral degree will first be offered in 1994. 

"Hazel's efforts in graduate studies will attract better 
students and faculty to Yale," said Cynthia Russett, one of 
Carby's colleagues in the history department. "Hazel is 
active as a kind of university statesperson. She is a remark-
ably wide-ranging scholar and a real asset co the university." 

Cara Hood (GRAD '96), a teaching assistant for Carby last 
term, commended Carby for expanding the focus of the 
graduate program. "Graduate school is a place starving for 
policies," said Hood. "And Hazel's classes are some of the 
few places where you'll get that." 

Students also benefic from Carby's juxtaposition of 
film, music, and literature. "She brings a special inter-disci-
plinary knowledge to her work," said Robert Stepco, a pro-
fessor tenured in the same departments as Carby and the first 
DGS for African and Afro-American studies. Stepco empha-
sized the importance of Carby's research 
on 19th century black women writers, 
early 20th century women blues singers, 
and the Chicago Renaissance in the 
1920s. 

Carby's interest in film led her to 
create the Black Film Collection from 
resources in the Film Studies Center. 
The collection received national atten-
tion following a conference Carby 
organized last year. In January, she tes-
tifie'd at a U.S. Senate hearing about 
the importance of access to and preser-
vation of film archives in the Library 
of Congress. 

In high demand around the coun-
try, Carby nonetheless focuses the bulk 
of her attention on her responsibilities 
as a scholar and a teacher. Her classroom 
style emphasizes candid interaction 
between students and instructors. "I 
talked with theTAs about trying to pro-
vide a secure atmosphere for people to 
say what they felt," Carby said about the 
sections for Black Women and Their 
.Forms of Culture. She said that stu-
dents' varied and emotional reactions to 
her class reflected the tensions in 
American society. "I want to give stu-
dents a sense that the issues in the class 
are not separate from real life," she said. 

In her lectures, Carby provided 
the historical context for books that 
would later serve as a framework for 
discussing contemporary issues of race. 
These talks gave way to "productive 
tensions," according to Hood, who led 
one of the sections. Students related 
personal experiences to those described 
in the texts, but some found that racial 
tensions limited the discussions. 

"There were certain th.ings that a black 
person could say that a white person 
couldn't," Skurnik said. "People were 
very afraid and very defensive." 

One Carby advisee, Rebecca 
Cohen (SY '93), called her section 
"very comfortable." However, others 
accused some white students of taking 
the course as a way of exploring non-
traditional literature, but without seri-
ous intellectual curiosity. "When we 
got into sections, we spent too much
