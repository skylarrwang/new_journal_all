Tucked behind Marcus Dairy 
on New Haven's Clinton 
Avenue is Vespoli USA, a mod-
est plant which happens to be the 
largest producer of crew racing shells 
in North America. Inside his factory's 
hangar-like space, former Olympic 
rower Mike Vespoli looms, disarming-
ly tall and broad-shouldered, over one 
of his slender 60-foot-long boats. A 
finger-knock against the hull makes a 
satisfyingly hollow thump. Built, after 
all, for people Vespoli's size, the boat 
looks impossibly delicate. "In the first 
crew race between Cambridge and 
Oxford in 1829, they used wooden 
boats that weighed more than 950 
pounds," says Vespoli. This boat weighs 
less than 200, and co bring ic up to the 
recently imposed minimum of 205 
pounds for men's eighc-oar shells, 
Vespoli will have co add weights. 
"This is a piece of the interior," he 
says, picking up a rectangle of whac 
looks like glazed cardboard, less than 
half-an-inch chick. "Try flexing it." 

The material feels as light as 
Styrofoam, but ic refuses to bend even 
a millimeter. "It's a resin-impregnated 
carbon composite," Vespoli explains 
-
fiberglass is now as outdated as 
wood. Before being made into boats, 
the sheets of composite look like 
rolled-up wallpaper and are stored in 
freezers. Workers peel off che backing 
and sandwich a si.ngle layer of stretchy 
nylon honeycomb between the sheets 
of composite. They arrange hand-cut 
pieces of the layered material in che . 
boat's mold. A huge box-like oven, set 
at 250 degrees Fahrenheit, is lowered 
over the mold, and the boac bakes for 
90 minutes. Baking releases che resin 
co flow between the cells of the honey-
comb, forming a material lighter than 
fiberglass but four times as stiff. 

"This is the same technology 
Sikorsky Aircraft uses," says Vespoli, as 
the oven rises slowly to hang above the 
outline of a freshly baked boat. 

Innovations borrowed from the 
aerospace industry have revolutionized 
boac designs, as well as materials. A 
company in San Diego works with 
Vespoli on new hull designs, using 
computer programs that predict the 
motion of any three-dimensional shape 
through water. But so much manual 
labor goes into boac building, Vespoli 
explains, chat the process still manages 
to fuse Space Age engineering with 
craftsmanship and customization. 

"You won't see this kind of care 
and finish even on a fine car any-
more," says Vespoli, scanding in the 
plane's last room where a worker is buff-
ing a boat. The worker passes a whirling 
wheel of soft material over the hull, 
releasing a sharp smell of resin and 
paint. The boats' surfaces shine. The 
paint-red for Radcliffe, purple for 
Williams-was carefully weighed before 
it was sprayed on. Another boat already 
has shoes installed in the sizes a coach 
specified for his crew. The whole pack-
age will carry a price tag of $16,000. 

Before he started his company in 
1980, Vespoli spent three years 
coaching Yale's freshman crew. 
He still speaks with the alert, con-
trolled energy of a coach, as enthusias-
tic about the sport of running a busi-
ness as he is intense about the details 
of rowing history. But he recalls, "I 
wasn't going to sit around waiting for a 
head coaching job." In the late 1970s, 
he had been importing boats as a 
licensee for a British company. 
"Building my own seemed like a logi-
cal progression," he says. Vespoli USA 
now turns out 300 boats a year and is 
the largest producer of eight-oar shells 
in the world. It built 90 percent ofYale's 
boats and 5 of the 13 that rhe U.S. 
Olympic team used in Spain last sum-
mer. Brightly colored banners from 
international rowing events hang in 
Vespoli's office, and a framed U.S. 
parent for the hull design of one of his 
eight-oar shells sits on a table. 

It doesn't seem to bother Vespoli 
that the plant on Clinton Avenue 
remains a mystery to the average New 
Haven cab driver. "It's easy to be a big 
fish in a small pond," he says with a 
laugh. Immersed in the pond since he 
started rowing crew at Georgetown, 
Vespoli speaks of the rowing world 
with amused affection. Rowers, for 
instance, are not to be confused with 
kayakers and canoers. "Rowers are 
more picky, for some reason," he says. 
Willie Black, Yale's current novice 
women's crew coach, speaks of the 
neverending debate among rowers 
over Vespoli shells versus "the yellow 
boats" 
made by Empacher of 
Germany, Vespoli's major internation-
al competitor. Black has no complaints 
about Yale's support of local talent. 
"Shoot," he says. "If Vespoli shells are 
good enough for the U.S. Olympic 
ream, they're good enough for us." 

Vespoli says his own perspective 
as a former rower and coach both 
helps and hurts his work. "Unless 
you're an outstanding engineer o r 
inventor you can't really revolution-
ize," he says. "But I know where 
coaches are coming from." Although 
he regrets that he himself no longer 
has time to coach, Vespoli likes the 
way his job keeps him in touch with 
rowing. He travels extensively, nego-
tiating contracts with institutions 
and governments in Asia, Europe, 
and Latin America. "We want to 
build everybody's boar," he says with 
pride.
