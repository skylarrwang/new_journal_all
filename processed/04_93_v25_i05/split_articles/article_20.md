the ceiling. Lining the walls, like the 
regal monumencs ar Stonehenge, are 
eight silver fermentation tanks with 
blue labels. They must be over 20 feet 
tall. Sunlight deans the entire space 
and cascades onto che concrete floor 
where a swash of beer and malt tum~ 
bles down the drains. Huge blue tubes 
coil on rhe floor, pumping beer. 

In the c~entef of it all is Blair Potts, 
loping around the metal drums like an 
anxious gnome. He wears a red Jzod 
over a workshirt which, pulled up, 
reveals strong arms. He used to row 
crew for Yale. His trousers tuck into 
big black rubber boots. He has little 
round glasses, an earnest and energetic 
look, and, at 30, thinning hair. He was 
a self-described "chemistry weenie" in 
high school. 

"I believe in the Jeffersonian ideal 
of the yeoman farmer, making a small 
contribution to the community, "he 
says, thoughtfully, pausing from 
adjusting a tube to look at me. "1 don't 
dance, can't sing, not such a writer, but 
I'm a pretty decent brewer." Blair 
moves over to tbe filter, which is con~ 
nected by rubes to the No. 4 tank, and 
check& a small window with a flash~ 
light. Fluid can be seen gliding by, 
golden and swift. He taps rhe metal. 
"Someday this thing is going to blow 
up and kill me." He continues, "I like 
creating things." He is very proud of 
their Blackwell Stout, named after the 
dog of his original partner, Elser. 
lronicaUy, Blair can't drink Blackwell 
Stout, or any beer for that matter, as he 
is allergic to hops. He can only sip, 
then spit. It seems to be a frequently 
mentioned, somewhat sore subject, so I 
ask him gingerly what his favorite beer 
is. "The Stout, ... he says nodding. "I 
originally made it to impress my wife." 

Blair moves over to cwo smaller 
ranks. He takes a glass, places it under a 
spigot on the underside of the tank 
marked "MASH TUM-CAP 724," 
then turns the spigot. Yellow liquid 
rushes out into the glass. "Here, try 
chis,'' he says and hands it to me. It's 
warm and castes jusr like malted~milk 
balls. "It's wort," Blair says, which 
rurns our to be raw beer. He proceeds 
co tell me the fine points of the New 
Haven brewing process. Wisconsin 
malr: is added to city water. The brew-
ery uj;es two-row malt, which is more 
traditional, more expensive, and takes 
longer co brew. Enzymes activate in the 
malt, and the sugar that ferments 
makes alcohol. Changing the tempera-
cure during this process is important; it 
determines the body of the beer. Six 
gallons of yeast are added per run. 
UnfortQnately fOr Blair, hops, a clarify~ 
ing agent or p~servative, is also added. 

We walk up a set of metal stairs nex( to 
the wort tank, and peer down inside. 
It's steaming. At the bottom is a little 
heap of white matter. "That's crub,"' 
Blair explains. "a protein sediment 
from the. brewing.., 

I turn around> and next co me at 
the top of the stairs ~ of all things, a 
canoe paddle. Blair dashes off before I 
can ;.tSk him if it has anything to do 
with removing the trub. I idly wonder 
jf they use the paddle to stir the beer. 

B
lair retu{ns, pacing along with 
quiet energy. Earlier he bad 
talked about the attractive 
lifestyle of a brewmaster, and now we 
continue discussjng what he likes 
about brewing-creativity. I listen and 
lean against a blue bucket fuU of used 
malt which, Blair tells me, he 
exchanges for a side of beef with a 
farmer in Monroe, Connecticut, 
named Bert Block. "Some people go 
into investment banking. some people 
go into medicine, some go into ... " 

Blair's voice recedes as he darts behind 
one of the tanh to check the C02 
content from a gauge. "And you?" I ask 
when he reappears. "WeU â€¢.. I guess I 
just had an open mind." 

The second run does not go 
smoothly. "Somebody must've changed 
the machine in here during lunch,., Jim 
mutt:ers to me and to the machine. 
"'Pretty horrible." The Anti-Christ is 
acting up; frequent explosions emanate 
from its insides. The remains of 40 or 
50 crushed bottles of beer wallow 
about on the sudsy floor. The labeler is 
not working well either; sticky labels 
point every which way. Jim has to stop 
the machine, slam doors, and toss 
expletives before he can get it working 
again. 

I'm still loading the conveyor belt; 
the pjle of empty caseS slowly shrinks. I 
understand what Blair meant when he 
said .that working in a brewery was 
hard work, that he often puts in ten-
hour days. Soon it is over though; 4:00 
and 361 cases bottled .in the aft-ernoon 
run. The machine fizzes out, dripping. 
Jim storms off in a Nietzschean rage. 
and we start to mop up the refuse and 
pour unused beer down the drain. 

Back in the office the mood has 
calmed. The three partners lounge in 
easy chai~ the picture of tired and sat-
isfied workers. A box of Oreo cookies is 
on one desk. "You don't see this in cor-
porate!" l>ellows Mike Gettings, who 
had been away for the day. " We need a 
nap break around here, cookies, milk," 
says Jim wanly, leaning back, still 
recovering from his run-in with the 
machine. Blair lopes out to the ware-
house. He returns with an unmarked 
brown bottle, silently opens it, pours, 
and passes around the glass. The beer is 
dark and thick, an extremely rich caste. 
It's the new Imperial Stout, a secret 
which he's been working on. 

When I leave I grab a six-pack of 
newly-bottled Connecticut Ale from 
their fridge. I'm reminded of what Jim 
said to me before: ''When you send 
some of these cases out of here it's 
almost like dropping off your kids on 
their first day of school." I carefully 
place the beer in my bag, shake hands 
with Blair and Jim, and leave the ware-
bouse. As I bike back over railroad 
tracks and bridges, the beer clunks soft-
ly against my back.
