munity project that has built many 
units of affordable housing in New 
Haven. The Yale Psychiatric Institute 
has established a pannership with the 
Hill Development Corporation that 
provides job training and employment 
in the health care field for Hill neigh-
borhood residents." 

All of the above are encouraging. 
Yet with the massive resources that this 
university commands, it is still neces-
sary to do more. Can Yale really afford 
not to? 

The nation has a new President 
who speaks of a commitment to 
improve the quality of life for all 
Americans. There are more people of 
color in Congress than ever before. 
And yet, while we celebrate these 
advances, we must not cling to the 
mistaken notion that public figures 
alone can transform our world for us. 
The changes, the progressions that we 
as youth need to spearhead, must 
occur first at the grassroots level. We 
must each give of our time and our 
energy. There is something unique 
about what each of us as human 
beings can contribute. However, we ~ 
students, in the tradition of all the stu:. 
dent activists who came before us, 
have a special obligation to push for 
change. 

Marian Wright Edelman is lobby-
ing the government for the funding 
which makes many important pro-
grams possible. Her biggest nightmare 
however, is that, after getting full 
funding for Head Start and programs 
whose successes have been demon-
strated time and time again, there will 
not be sufficient numbers of dedicat-
ed, competent, and committed per-
sonnel to fulfill their mandates. What 
good is a battle plan without soldiers? 
In real terms, an idea intellectually 
conceived without being actualized 
makes for a hollow victory. 

t is 1993. A year has gone by. The 
racism, the violence, the ci~ies 
without jobs, and the schools w1th-

out money continue to exist. And 
while there are some successes, many 
problems fester unabated. 

As Rabbi Arnold Wolf wrote in a 
1976 issue of the Yale Alumni 
Magazine, "We have lost our illusions 
at Yale. We live within the inner city 
.surrounded by poverty and crime, and 
there are no islands in this city where 
we live. The dream of the ivory tower

and the safe refuge are gone. As if it 
were possible to lock out all those who 
were different from us. It is the law of 
the scripture and also of the w~rld that 
oppression brings retribution, that 
benign n eglect brings panic in its 
wake. We cannot be invulnerable sur-
rounded by vulnerability." 

It js time to take stock of what we 
said and where we have gone since the 
riots and the protests at Yale. We must 
realize that for most people conditions 
have not changed. Yet, while being 
realistic in our appraisal, we must be 
committed to the belief that each of us 
can, in some unique and individual 
way, work towards the achievement of 
social justice. Our predecessors have 
found the courage to pave the way. We 
must not abandon this mandate. 

Unless action follows, expressions of 
emotion as displayed on Beinecke 
temporarily ease guilt but in the end 
do nothing. 

It is time for each of us to take person-
al inventory. 

Or, do we really need another wake-up 
call?
