**Title: BETWEEN THE VINES-----Hooking Up**

There was something sweet and strange about that 
night, when Mike Maloney held my hand for hours inside 
my coat pocket, so nobody could see. Not like I thought 
anything would come of it-here was a boy I knew only as a 
friend of a friend-a stranger. He was pretty drunk and 
extravagant on the dance floor, dipping me, making the 
room spin. He seemed only halfway aware of me, anyway, 
and never called me by my name. The whole encounter was 
doubtful, as my roommates pointed out the next morning. 
And yet, and yet. He was a junior, tall and broadshouldered, 
and he wore a long wool coat like my father's. It was 
December and my cheeks burned and this boy I hardly 
knew held my hand steadily for an entire night. 

I was breathless from it-dizzy not from the beer we 
shared on a stairway somewhere but from the sense of devel-
oping events-and I smiled and smiled, wondering. I was 18 
and could not get over the recklessness. This was the front 
end of experience for me; nothing like high school. I was not 
as aware of that as I was of his broad bands, his suede bucks, 
the straight brown hair that fell over his eyes. 

The scene had possibilities but collapsed under its own 
weight later in the evening as I became, by gradations, dead 
sober. This is what I remember: we .are at some marginal 
fraternity near my college and he st:Ods close behind me, 
barely touching me, like we had agreed on something. We 
are with five boys and one girl, and the girl lies sprawled on 
this water bed in this weird fraternity and says, with total 
candor, that she has never had sex on a waterbed. There is a 
pregnant pause. We stand, mulling this over, and someone 
says, "If we had. cards, we could play Asshole." 

So I balked. I walked home alone in the cold, regretting 
something, thinking I should be more open to things. I 
don't hook up much; the ridiculousness of it always strikes 
me at the wrong time, and the sweet scene of Mike Maloney 
holding my hand gives way to some moron in a fraternity 
suggesting that we play cards. And it replays itSelf, not just 
for me but for my friends: a kid asks us to play pool in his 
basement, or listen to Elvis in his apartment, or see the 
glow-in-the-dark stars on his ceiling. Sometimes we go. 

Hooking up has become a way of life for some of us-
seemingly safe, empowering, and a uniquely collegiate phe-
nomenon. These four years make it not precisely promiscu-
ous, because they are college boys. They were on the debate 
team in high school, probably, and we expect them to listen 
if we tell them to stop. Generally they don't go very far sex-
ually. They are drinking from the same keg, their hands 
touch by accident, she puts on his baseball cap, he pulls a 
strand of hair out of her mouth and by then they are so 
close it is inevitable. We don't, as a rule, pick up men in 
nightclubs. On campus things are different-the egregious 
pick-up lines are still lines but somehow endearing-even 
boys with experience are boys, and awkward. 

My friend Natalie has long thick hair and wears well-
cut French blazers. She lies on her back on her bed ro tell 
me about hooking up; she ticks them off and comes up with 
the number 21. Most of them were freshman year, when "a 
weekend you didn't hook up was-" She doesn't finish but 
what she means is a bust, a useless night our, a game you 
lost. Natalie has distilled the experience over time, and her 
philosophy has shifted a little since freshman year, when she 
expected the guys to call her afterwards. 

"It is worth having a man sleep in your bed," she says, 
finally. "It is worth having a warm body, a little release. 
Sometimes you just want a little fix." 

Natalie is dating someone now. So far things have been 
fairly orthodox: they sing in the same chorus and she liked 
him from afar, then dared herself to talk to him, now he 
calls her and comes early to our parties. We tell her, repeat-
edly, bow cute he is, but she frowns. She's not sure if she 
likes him and doesn't want to lead him on. I hear her on the 
phone to her sister, talking about ambivalence. She says last 
night she started noticing flaws. As soon as you are close 
enough to see pores, she says, everything else dissolves into

them. He is paunchy, appareni:Iy. 

Natalie prefers boys on teams. 

Reaching back to her salad days 
for my sake, she smiles, proud of her 
ability to hook up on a regular basis. 
She reels off case studies, strategies and 
her -personal weapon: significant eye 
contact. 

One time there were actually bets 
placed between Natalie and a friend at a 
dance, freshman year. Blackstodcinged, 
fiercely turned out, the two gitls "picked 
out these random guys and just . 
worked it." Natalie caught this kid's 
eye-he played football-and he came 
over to dance with her. "We sort of 
established that we were going to hook 
up before we even had a conversation," 
she says, smiling and still astonished at 
her nerve. So finally they did have a 
conversation, sitting in the college 
common room. He was already hold-
ing her hand, and when he finally 
talked he said, "Your lips are so red, 
you are so sensuous," she recalls. She 
says she tried to shut him up before 
she got too appalled to go home with 
him. "It's easier to fool around than 
just talk," she says. "Can you imagine Â· 
just talking for seven hours?" 

Recalling the incident, Natalie 
laughs. She is a girl with attitude, 
someone who isolates what she wants 
and works systematically. "I definitely 
felt powerful that I had the ability to 
just pick someone out," she says. 
When she likes a guy, that power evap-
orates. 

Late-night empowerment can also 
quickly degenerate into early-morning 
embarassment. Alice, who has hooked 
up five times in four years, calls it 
"post hook-up syndrome," and my 
friend Dianne has it bad. Late in fresh-
man year, Dianne was picked up by a 
senior named Lewis whom she recalls, 
dismissively, as "kind of cute." They 
met at a fraternity-Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, she says-and after a short 
conversation that "wasn't all that 
sophisticated," he kissed her, embarassed 
her, and came up with the creative solu-
tion of going to his room. Which she 
did, sternly, articulating her limits like 
it says in Our Bodies, Ourselves. Later 
on, Dianne tried to dress in the dark, 
bumping into furniture because she 
didn't want to wake him up. 

She escaped to his bright bath-
room and realized that in her hurry 
she had left "a few crucial items" in 
Lewis' room. Three years after the fact, 
Dianne attempts to recreate the sce-
nario that became what we remember 
as the Bra Incident. 

This incident brought Lewis' true 
nature into high beams, and it turned 
out Lewis was a schmuck. Dianne says 
she "called him about 500 times" and 
left messages requesting the return of 
her "scuff." No response. So finally she 
confronted him in the post office and 
demanded her bra. He promised to 
leave it in a paper bag in a cubbyhole 
outside his dining hall and she checked 
it every day for weeks to no avail. 

"It became an obsession with me," 
says Dianne. "I had dreams about it. I 
had this one nightmare where I went 
into his room to look for it and in his 
closet there were rows and rows of bras 
and none of them were mine." 

Dianne's experience with Lewis is 
a classic example of .. :rftermath, the 
biggest strike against hooking up. 

"My best hookups have been with 
people who I knew I would never ever 
ever see again," says Dianne, remem-
bering a German exchange student, a

swimmer from Brown. Otherwise the 
night gets complicated. Is it a law of 
thermodynamics? If you kiss a 
stranger, even a very appealing 
stranger, between 1:30 and 3:30 
Saturday night, you are likely to pass 
him frequently over the course of the 
next week and then regularly until he 
graduates or you do. And you may 
avoid looking at him, or you may say 
hello, but you won't ask him for your 
bra back, and he won't ask you to the 
movies. Romance dies quickly in these 
situations; embarassment lasts forever. 

My friends, who are seniors, say 
the key to escaping this uneasiness is 
low expectations. "Freshman year I 
sort of wanted something afterwards, 
and that's kind of naive," says one 
woman. Now these women are power-
hungry and utterly pragmatic. 

Recently Natalie lured to her room a 
boy with "long wavy hair" who "spoke 
French." They listened to music and 
kissed for a long time. When he left, 
1he said, "If I give you my address and 
phone number, will you write to me or 
call me?" And Natalie said, "Just enjoy
