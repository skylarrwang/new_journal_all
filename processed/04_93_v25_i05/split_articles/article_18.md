the peace process." 
UNH attempted to assuage con-
cerns, declaring that the HaSharon 
campus would welcome both Israelis 
and Arabs. Elqana would become a 
place for both to meet in peace. "The 
rhetoric of UNH began to change," 
observed DiMow. "They suddenly 
became interested in building bridges." 
The HaSharon campus, DeNardis said, 
would be "a laboratory in which 
mutual understanding and coexistence 
can be seen as a positive example, an 
incubator of hope for the future of the 
region." 

Members of the mounting oppo-
sition criticized UNH's naivete. ADC 
further accused UNH of discriminat-
ing against Arabs, since no Palestinian 
f~culty had been chosen. "The only 
.Arabs able to get into the university 
will be those who come to clean," said 
Amiram Goldblum, spokesperson for 
Israeli Peace Now. Even worse, oppo-
nents viewed the perceived radicalism 6f 
Elqana's settlers as a danger to the lives 
of any Arabs who might possibly come 
to the HaSharon campus. No 
Palestinian would enroll, they predict:t 
ed. "We knew full well that most of the 
students would be Israelis," explained 
DeNardis recently, "but we thought, 
that by flying the American flag, we 
could attract some Palestinian students 
as well. If that is naive, then so be it." 

The settlers raised the loudest 
voices in UNH's defense. "If Arabs 
want to, they'll come," Nisan 
Shlomiansky, the head of the Elqana 
local council, told the Israeli daily 
Ha'aretz. "If no Indian comes to study 
at a university in the States, does that 
mean that it discriminates?" 

UNH began to find the climate of 
opinion at home much less hospitable 
than that ofElqana. The original lack of 
campus opposition to the plan "was 
based on a willingness to trust a new 
administration," wrote Joel Marks, asso-
ciate professor of philosophy at UNH, 
to the New Haven Register, "and, more 
particularly, on several assertions by that

administration which subsequently 
proved to be erroneous." 

UNH stood practically alone. In 
January, a little over a month since it 
revealed the plan to the public, UNH 
announced a delay in the opening of 
the HaSharon campus due to "height-
ened political tensions" in the region. 
The delay was widely interpreted as a 
way for the university to save face, 
while extricating itself from a political 
morass. UNH did not halt, however, 
its search for an overseas site. 

DeNardis traveled to Israel early this 
year to continue negotiations with the 
consortium so that UNH can realize 
its dream of a campus abroad-this 
rime, on the right side of the line.

t's been a long and unpre-
dictable quest," said DeN ardis 
of his university's strange 
adventure in the realm of international 
policies. Israeli news reports insinuated 
education; it ended up subverting the 
government ban on settlements in the 
territories. Ron Malamud, spokesper-
son for the education minister's office, 
said, 'This looks like a last grab by the 
old government." More likely, the 
HaSharon campus simply represented 
a convergence of interests that sought 
to accomplish a number of objectives, 
only a few of which were purely educa-
tional. 

Although the University of New 
Haven claims to have washed its hands 
of the entire affair, construction of a 
university still progresses in Elqana. 
The city engineer remains under the 
impression that his client is UNH. 
"We are not going ahead with the 
plan," DeNardis insisted. "We are not 
opening a campus in Elqana." But the 
continuing construction suggests that 
the answers to why UNH became a bit 
player in the ongoing drama in the 
Middle East may ultimately lie, if not 
in West Haven, then in Elkana or even 
Jerusalem. While the battle over the 
Occupied Territories rages on, the 
University of New Haven persists in its 
search for a home in Israel. Like Israel, 
UNH remains far from finding peace 
in the promised land.
