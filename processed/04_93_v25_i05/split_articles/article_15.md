Since arriving at Yale in 1989, Hazel Carby has invigo-
rated discussion about race, gender, and politics 
throughout the university. Carby, a professor tenured 
in three departments-
English, American studies, and 
Afro-American studies-
and the director of graduate stud-
ies (DGS) in Afro-American studies, argues that the inclu-
sion of people of color on university syllabi represents only a 
small step towards a tolerant and equitable society. 

Colleagues and students praise Carby's ability to pre-
sent complicated issues in the classroom without imposing 
her own opinions. Her even-handed approach is especially 
noteworthy because understatement is not her style. Carby's 
thoughtfully paced speech is ftlled with a disciplined urgen-
cy. "She says very antagonistic things that are true and that. 
other professors shy away from," said Lizzie Skurnik (PC 
'95), an Afro-American studies major. "I really admire her 
for that." 

One of only two tenured black women at Yale, Carby 
often speaks of hypocrisy and racism both in the academic 
community and in American society. "While the attention 
of faculty and administrators has been directed toward 
increasing the representation of different social groups in 
the curriculum or the college handbook," she wrote last year 
in an essay entitled "The Multicultural Wars," "few alliances 
have been forged with substantial forces across this society 
chat will significantly halt and reverse the declining num-
bers of black, working-class, and poor people among uni-
versity student bodies or faculty." 

Until these alliances are forged, Carby suggests, white 
students will read about black culture without ever encoun-
tering it in a real-life setting. "I don't want students to feel 
that they know black people just from reading books by 
them," she said. The inclusion of texts written by people of 
color, Carby argues, often serves as an inadequate substitute 
for a broader program of societal integration. 

Last semester, Carby explored issues of race in Black 
Women and Their Forms of Culture, a lecture class she 
taught for the English department. "These questions may 
be contentious, they may be provocative, but I think they're 
extremely important," she said. "Classrooms shoul~n't be 
cushioned. It's important to ask why the discomfort arises 
when we t.alk about race." 

Carby's mix of impassioned confrontation and dis-
tanced scholarship, of literature, ftlm, and music, of 
political activism and what one colleague called 
"statespersonship," has drawn the attention not only of fac-
ulty and students at Yale but also of the national media. Last 
semester, Carby was invited to speak on the Oprah Winfrry 
Show about the ftlm Malcolm X and the mainstream mar-
keting of black culture. 

Winfrey asked Carby whether the ftlm would impact 
national race relations. "White people will see Malcolm X, 
but they do not want black kids from the inner city sitting 
next to their kids in the white suburbs," Carby responded. 
"It speaks to the deep hypocrisy of our society, and it's a 
substitute for the political action needed to desegregate our 
society." Taken aback by Carby's frank response to her ques-
tions, Winfrey, one of the ftlm's major ftnancial backers, 
quickly returned to questioning Spike Lee, the film's direc-
tor, before going to a commercial break. "Oprah only let 
professor Carby talk for a couple of seconds," said Liz 
Chang (BR '95), a Carby student who watched the pro-
gram. "She cut her off as soon as she got political." 

Carby dismisses the publicity she and other prominent 
black scholars receive from the American media. "Instead of 
the issue being the breadth of African-American intellectu-
als, one scholar is taken and given a lot of attention," Carby 
said. "In particular, the very existence of black male profes-
sors seems to fascinate the New York Times," she noted in 
"Multicultural Wars." Carby wrote that an Aprill990 front 
page article about Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., 
"adopts such an incisive tone of ridicule that one wonders if 
the newspaper's editorial staff consciously decided to create 
a cartoon of black studies as a ship of fools." 

If Carby's determined political speech remains too chal-
lenging for the mainstream forum of an afternoon talk show 
or daily newspaper, it finds myriad followers at Yale. 
"Bringing Hazel Carby here was a big step forward that I 
hope represents a substantial commitment to Afro-
American studies from the university," said Afro-American 
studies and history professor Melvin Ely. 

A self-proclaimed Marxian scholar, Carby said her 
research follows a tradition of black, socialist analysis. "I use
