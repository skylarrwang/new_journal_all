'm bottling beer. Eighi:-thirty on a Tuesday morning and 
we're about to load, fill, and cap the first run of 
Connecticut Ale, New Haven Brewing's newest line of 
bottled beer. New Haven Brewing is the largest brewery in 
New Haven-the only brewery in New Haven for that mat-
ter. They are the makers of the ever popular Elm City 
Golden Ale and of Blackwell Stout, the beer with the black 
dog on the label. I've come to their old white warehouse at 
458 Grand Avenue to bottle beer for five dollars an hour. 

Outside the warehouse is an industrial wharf criss-crossed 
by train tracks and a canal which leads down to the harbor. 
Inside, Jim Gordon, a partner in the brewery, walks by 
looking for a bottle opener. 

The airy warehouse has four rooms. There's an office 
filled with pictures and clippings, a basketball hoop, and, 
when I first arrive, a toddler nicknamed "Bud" who is 
bumping randomly into the walls. Presumably, he belongs 
to someone. The office opens onto a storage area traversing 
the length of the warehouse, longer than two basketball 
courts and lined with cases and blue kegs. Inside this space, 
partitioned by walls and windows are the Brewhouse and 
the bottling room. I walk through swinging doors into the 
bottling room. It's large, about 40 feet by 40 feet, and curv-
ing around its wall, inhabiting the space, is the monstrous 
stainless steel machine. It reaches to the ceiling, bursting 
with bits of metal: levers, sprockets, a twisting conveyer belt

on stilts going in and out, angling tubes. The tubes cut 
through a glass wall through which I can see the last room, 
the Brewhouse, and the bottoms of massive silver tanks. 

The whole place reminds me of my milking days growing 
up on a farm: the stainless steel, the buckets, the gulping 
tubes, teats. But there are no teats here, no udders. And no 
milk either, just beer. 

Work begins. My jobÂ· is to take empty brown bottles 
from the stacks of green and blue cases in the center of the 
room and place them on the conveyor belt. As I start load-
ing the belt I notice a large plastic sign to my right, leaning 
against a window. It shouts: 

ACHTUNG! 
Das Machine is Nicht Fur Gerfingerpoken Und 
Mittengraben. Is Easy Schnappen Der Springenwerk, 
Blowenfusen Und Poppencorken Mit Spitzensparken. Is Nicht 
Fur Gerwerken By Dumbkopftn. Das Rubbernecken 
Sightseeren Keepin Das Hands in Das Pockets. Relaxen Und 
'Watch Das Blinkenlights. 

I proceed cautiously. ROTATING PALLETS CAN 
CRUSH FINGERS says an official sticker on the belt, com-
plete with a picture of a mangled hand. Other workers filter 
into the room and someone turns on a Neil Young tape. Jim 
Gordon strides by. With his white sweater, round glasses, 
and shoulder-length blond hair he looks like a very hip 
German philosopher. Only his rubber boots and his smile

give him away as a brewer. He disappears and the bottling 
machine yawns itself awake, coming to life with a hum of 
hydraulics. Belts start to churn, and I hear the swish of fluid 
passing. 

The first empty bottle goes down the line, leaving my 
hand and leading its compatriots in an upright brown pro-
cession down the belt. As it reaches the corner of the room, 
it takes a left. The parade orders itself into single file at this 
point, a spot of frequent traffic jams. One of the workers, a 
middle-aged man in a blue hat that says "NHFD Local 
825" scoops soapy water onto the belt with a long silver 
cooking-ladle. This smooths the run. Now the bottle gets 
cleaned; supported on both sides by plastic tubing, it turns 
360 degrees as water jets on both sides douse it inside and 
out, removing any dust. Then it takes a left into the maw of 
the machine. Through a protective glass window I see a 
rubber faucet clamp onto the bottle and fill it with beer. 
When the faucet unclamps, the top of the bottle foams with 
sudsy beer head, and waits for the capper. Jim takes a scoop, 
the kind you'd find in a coffee store, fills it with caps, jumps 
up on a ladder, and tosses the clinking goldens into a hole in 
the top of the machine. With a whoosh the bottle is capped, 
and with a slap the label stuck on. The label around the 
neck says Connecticut Ale; the one on the body is tradition-
al white with"Elm City" in green and blue letters. The first 
labels stick on at all angles, but that doesn't matter. Because 
of contaminants the first couple of cases are thrown out. 

Loading proves strenuous and monotonous. Four giant 
stacks of cases, heavy with empty bottles, sit in the center of 
the room. I lift one case, bring it to th{ belt, unload the bot-
des as quickly as possible, and toss the empty case onto a 
jumbled pile to the right. The motion repeats, and a 
rhythm is born. Working with me is a man named Pete 
with a wool hat and a Texaco shirr. He's a drummer in a 
local band and he taps his fingers against the cases as he 
unloads them. He's much better at unloading than I am, 
picking up four bottles in one movement. Three men work 
at the other end of the machine, taking the beer-filled, wet, 
labeled bottles, making sure labels aren't upside down, and 
packaging them in the empty cases we've thrown their way. 
It takes the machine one minute to churn out 80 bottles. 

During a break I sidle over behind the machine where 
Jim is sitting like a yuppie Buddha. "You have to buy the 
good stuff," he says, pointing to the machine with a spray of 
water from his hose. "If you bake cookies in a plastic pan 
you can't expect-" A bottle explodes. Jim hoses the works 
of the machine, pushing spilled beer, crumpled labels, and 
broken glass off the apparatus onto the floor. Things are 
going smoothly for now; it's natural to lose around 50 beers 
in a run of 360 cases. The machine can "act up" though; 
Jim affectionately calls it the Anti-Christ. I ask him what he 
. enjoys most about brewing. "Not this," he replies, gesturing 
APRIL I6, 199~ 
at the machine. "The best part of the job is walking into a 
bar and getting compliments when they don't even know 
who you are." "What's your favorite beer?" I ask. Jim 
laughs. "The Stout." 

I go upstairs to help grab some bottle tops. The loft of 
the warehouse is immense, dim, and shadowed. Wooden 
rafters. hang over a stretching dusty floor, and boxes of sup-
plies line the wall, all appropriately labeled with the green-
and-blue Elm City logo. A gray couch sits alone in the mid-
dle of the loft: a rhino alone in the veldt. A croquet set rests 
in a box next to the wall. I can imagine the brewers taking a 
break and coming up here for a quick game. 

I go back to hauling bottles. Through the glass in front 
of me I can see the storage area and stacks of hefty brown 
bags with BRIESS MALT -CHILTON WI written on the 
side. Each bag is 50 pounds; I find out later that New 
Haven Brewing orders around 40,000 pounds of malt from 
Wisconsin every five or six weeks. About 500 pounds are 
used in each run. It sounds like a lot, but compared to larg-
er breweries like Anheuser-Busch it's nothing. 

Microbrewing, though expanding, is a small and spe-
cialized industry-worlds apart from the giants of 
Milwaukee and St. Louis. Beginnings are often humble. 
New Haven Brewing started with Blair Potts (BK '84) 
experimenting with beer recipes as an undergrad in his Taft 
building apartment. Rick Elser (BR '81), owner of Richter's 
Bar, joined him and they incorporated in 1987. Since then 
Elser has left and Jim Gordon has come aboard. They were 
joined by a chubby third partner, Mike Gettings, the ironic 
inspiration behind Mr. Mike's Light Ale, New Haven 
Brewing's light beer. In 1989 they moved to 458 Grand 
Avenue, a converted trolley barn. New Haven Brewing now 
supplies countless retailers, Yale sports teams, restaurants

and bars in the area .. Nevertheless, in one year they will pro-
duce less than two-thirds as much beer as Anheuser-Busch 
will spill in one day. It's an old brewing cliche, but true. 

With a dying whoosh from the machine the first run is 
over. It's 11:30 and we've bottled 359 cases. The union man 
gestures at me, then around him, and says, "Relax, have a 
beer." 

During lunch I venture into the Brewhouse. It's a won-
derful room. Glass-paned windows frame the view of snow-
covered Grand Avenue. Wooden rafters cross high above on
