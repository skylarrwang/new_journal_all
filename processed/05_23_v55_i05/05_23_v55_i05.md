Thank you to our donors.
since nineteen sixty-seven
Dear readers,

A few weeks ago, we hosted our Bulldog Days event in a small room at 
the top of Phelps Hall. We did not belong there. Still, we set down our 
things and made it so—half-eaten bags of hot chips, a modest pile of tote 
bags, and enough Red Bulls to kill someone. We worried if people would 
come. Slowly, they did, and we welcomed a small cohort of five.

The New Journal began for us this way, too: a small group of editors, a 
small mess of junk food, and a small table at which we barely belonged. 
Over the past year, we have found a home here. This April, we welcomed 
back the people who have created their own homes in The New Journal, 
the people who have cared for this magazine over the course of nearly five 
decades. It seems this home is still as scrappy as they remember. 
But as we all do this time of year, we begin as we leave. 
In our board’s first issue, our stories interrogate the safe places many call 
home. Amelia Davidson’s cover story explores an approach to make 
New Haven a safer place to live—but some envision radically different 
ways to protect this peace. Megan Vaz parses out efforts to create systems 
of support against sexual violence, often at the expense of emotionally 
burdening our cces. Elisa Cruz writes of the struggle to make New Haven 
Public Schools sanctuaries, rather than sites of surveillance. 
While we work to make our existing homes more caring, we may negotiate 
the things that constitute them, creating something new yet familiar. 
Grace Ellis recalls her dear friend Allis’s path to the “irrevocable condition” 
of home. Connor Arakaki creates presence from absence as she weaves 
together fragments of her Indigenous Hawaiian identity. And to begin this 
issue as we end this letter, Ashley Chin introduces us to the found families 
of Elm City Games and the refuge to be found in play.

We are about to scatter around the globe, leaving some things behind and 
holding on to others. We hope you’ll take these stories with you as you go.
TNJ Love,
The New Managing Board

be whoever you are,’” Fantastic explains. 
“No one’s going to say something, you 
know, negative or hurtful or even just 
thoughtless.” 
Fantastic tells me that over the past 
seven years, ECG has been a place where 
LGBTQIA+ patrons have felt safe enough 
to come out. Some use ECG to figure out 
a different way of presenting themselves 
than they would at work or home or 
school. For a lot of players, ECG acts as a 
safe space to negotiate queerness. 
Elm City Games hosts its online 
community on Discord, where play-
ers mingle, talk smack, and organize 
game nights. This is where I struck up 
a conversation with Brenda W., who 
requested not to be identified by name 
as to not be outed to her parents. She 
replied to my post, commenting that 
her first experience using her preferred 
name as an openly trans woman was at 
ECG: “I never once have had reason to 
regret that decision.”
Brenda had mostly been interacting 
with the ECG community through the 
Discord server, when she started ques-
tioning her gender. She had yet to settle 
on a name, a hesitation she explained 
was “mostly due to internalized anxiety 
on my part, making me doubt . . . whether 
or not the name I chose was right, 
whether it would feel good hearing other 
people use it, as well as worrying about 
what would happen if word got back to 
my parents.” 
She happened to be in for a game 
of Armada with another player from the 
ECG Discord, who only knew her by her 
username. They were making comfort-
able small talk before the match, until 
he asked for her name. Her mind went 
blank; the little script she’d rehearsed in 
her head went out the window. 
“I just stood there awkwardly for a 
moment and explained that I was trans 
and in between names at the moment,” 
she explained to me over Discord mes-
sage. “He was totally cool with it, so 
I took my shot with my favorite of the 
choices I’d been kicking around.” She 
told him she was trying the name Brenda. 
Hearing the other player sound her 
name out back to her abated her initial 
anxieties. “From that moment on, I’ve 
been Brenda and I couldn’t be happier.”
When I asked what made Brenda 
feel that ECG was safe enough to come 
out, she pointed to the store’s owners, 
Matt Fantastic and Trish Loter, who 
both had multiple pronouns listed 
under their Discord usernames, and 
who, in her eyes, “generally cultivated 
a left-leaning political culture and atti-
tude, both in-store and in the server.” 
Other stores Brenda had visited didn’t 
feel quite as welcoming; one store in 
Wallingford was particularly rude to 
new customers and tolerated homopho-
bic remarks made by other clientele. 
“Games traditionally have a reputa-
tion for being this domain of, you know, 
shitty men,” Fantastic explained to me, 
“There’s just this kind of casual shitti-
ness.” ECG aims to upend that. Fantastic 
describes the archetypal board gamer 
as the “um, actually” player who’s a real 
stickler for the rules. Ben Walter, a staff 
member at Yale’s Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion by day and a Magic: the 
Gathering (Magic) regular by night, 
recalls the experience of playing at a 
Magic convention, describing it as “a 
rules, lawyerly environment.” A lot of 
the fun in Magic, for Walter, lies in the 
tabletop conversation during which alli-
ances and rivalries are formed. ECG game 
nights are typically more conversational 
and allow players to backtrack, whereas 
official Magic games are played strictly 
by the book. If you blurt out any inac-
curacies, Walter explains, the “um, actu-
ally” gamers are quick to cut you off and 
recite the rulebook. He pauses, searching 
for the right words to name this impulse. 
“It becomes this very mansplainy, mas-
culine desire to prove yourself by being 
right . . . So it’s not fun, honestly.”
For DnD game night—the store’s 
most popular game—Dungeon Masters 
(DMs) are briefed on ECG’s standards. 
An institution in its own right, DnD is 
a collaborative game in which players

More than Play
F
rom that very first night I 
happened by Chapel Street, I was 
charmed. Maybe it was the hot pink 
facade that unapologetically spans three 
storefronts. Maybe it was the two life-
sized kobolds—a kind of monster from 
Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)—that 
grumbled at me from the window display 
with their spears raised, like guardians at 
the shop’s front door. It was most prob-
ably, though, the ambience of Elm City 
Games (ECG) on a busy night: tables by 
the windows were filled with customers 
chatting away, while a giant rainbow flag 
greeted passersby.
“It’s just our natural state of being,” 
says Elm City Games owner Matt 
Fantastic, whose larger-than-life last 
name evolved from a joke gone too far. 
“We’re queer-owned . . . and most of our 
staff is some varying flavor.” 
Originally founded in 2016 as a cor-
ner inside the now-shuttered Happiness 
Lab café, the business has grown along 
with its community to take on three 
storefronts, which now house some 
of the three thousand items in inven-
tory that line the store’s floor-to-ceil-
ing shelves. The brightly painted rooms 
flanking the store’s interior are the game 
café areas where, for ten or twenty bucks, 
customers are free to play on one of the 
shop’s game nights.
With their Hell Fire’s Club baseball 
hat and long unruly hair, Fantastic ini-
tially struck me as Eddie Munson from 
Stranger Things come to life. Like Eddie, 
Fantastic grew up playing Dungeons and 
Dragons, and evoking Eddie’s famous 
guitar solo of Metallica’s “Master of 
Puppets,” Fantastic had a brief career in 
the nineties Brooklyn musicscape, where 
they played in “loud angry bands.” 
Though 
Fantastic 
nonchalantly 
answers that the store is queer-owned, 
the abundant progressive imagery that 
pervades the store—the massive rainbow 
sidewalks just outside, the little queer 
identity flag stickers for sale—is very 
intentional. As Fantastic affectionately 
characterizes it, the store’s strategy is to 
be “aggressively progressive.” 
“It’s important to put it really out 
there that ‘hey, you can come here and

roleplay as adventurers of their own cre-
ation, banding together to take on a jour-
ney spun by the DM. Fantastic explains 
that during gameplay at ECG, general 
swearing is okay but casual homopho-
bia, misogyny, or any hate speech is “like 
super not cool.” Fantastic continues, 
“Really it’s about having fun . . . We want 
people that are excited to share their 
love of DnD with new people.” They 
emphasize that “welcoming players of 
all backgrounds is a big priority to the 
organizers.”


In this spirit, ECG organizes the 
Elm City Adventure Squad, a begin-
ner friendly, in-house program for DnD. 
Though Luke Mastalli-Kelly, software 
engineer by day and DM by night, is no 
stranger to running campaigns, he admits 
that there’s a lot more consideration that 
goes into programming a session for ECG 
than for the typical DnD campaign. “It 
needs to be inclusive in a wide vari-
ety of ways,” Mastalli-Kelly writes over 
Discord message. “I’ve [run DnD] games 
for everyone—from a kid who hadn’t 
played much DnD and mostly wanted 
to fish, to folks who have been playing 
since the very first editions of the game 
and are focused adventurers.” It strikes 
me how thoughtful Mastalli-Kelly has to 
be to include everyone in the game. For 
the fishing-obsessed kid, he had to find 
a way to have fishing advance the plot: 
“I think he eventually caught a fish that 
was grabbed by one of the Sahuagin [or 
a half-man, half-sea creature monster] 
stalking the boat. Gave him a unique rea-
son to care about the threat!” 


I couldn’t help but think back to the 
groups of friends I had seen through a 
window that very first time I happened 
by in one of the game rooms. Mastalli-
Kelly and his fiancée had gotten involved 
with game nights almost as soon as they 
moved to New Haven in January 2020. 
He also hosts a separate DnD game 
night, spun out of friends he made from 
previous Elm City Adventure Squad 
games: “That’s how I actually met folks 
who turned out to be neighbors in my 
little apartment complex before I moved 
into a house.”


At this point, I was itching to join a 
game night at ECG. As luck would have it, 
a spot had opened up with the Elm City 
Adventure Squad. For my very first foray, 
I revived a character I had imagined 
from my 13-year-old fanfiction days: 
Kat—a hot, emo, dark magic-wielding, 
half-demon type of few words (offi-
cially, I was a Tiefling Warlock). Kat was 
joined by Mockwind, a grouchy, mon-
ey-chasing warlock; Garuda, an aloof, 
novel-writing Owlin Sorlock (a half-
owl humanoid of a mixed class combin-
ing sorcerers and warlocks); Damion, a 
brooding hero-type fighter; Ranger, a 
bumbling Barbarian Dwarf with the 
catchphrase “It’s Dwarfing Time!”; and 
Dax, a pint-sized Fairy Ranger who 
doubles as a sheriff with an on-and-off 
Southern drawl. Snee, our ventrilo-
quist Dungeon Master, led us through 
a storyline of his own creation—we six 
adventurers had been hired to take out 
a kobold infestation that was terrorizing 
a town. 


We marched through with Damion 
and Dax at the helm, who had a good 
cop, bad cop schtick going. The others 
spewed out catchphrases in character 
(sound effects included) as I lucked out 
by roleplaying with sparse words. Over 
the course of the four-hour session, the 
guys chipped away at my introversion. 
Roman, a retiree who commandeered 
Ranger the Dwarf, won me over with 
packs of M&Ms. As we looted the corpse 
of a champion we’d defeated, Terry 
interrupted, “We should let the newbies 
have first pick.” Michael had picked up 
a powerful magic item—the Wand of 
Fish Magic. In a gruff voice, Michael 
presented the wand to me: “To congrat-
ulate the youngin’ on her first adventure.” 
Andrew, who had been explaining the 
game to me, smiled kindly: “It does a lot 
of damage for a level one character.” 


The Wand of Fish Magic proved to 
be quite pivotal. The final boss, a Kobold 
King backed by a wizard, had effort-
lessly thwarted my fellow adventurers’ 
attacks until it became my turn. For the 
first spell I would ever cast, I was ready 
to bring out the big guns. Under my 
breath, I announced my plan: “I wanna 
nuke ‘em.” Everyone pooled together 
dice for me to roll. It added up to twen-
ty-two, more than enough to end the 
Kobold King in one blow. Snee grinned 
at me: “How do you wanna do this?” I 
described what came to mind: clutch-
ing the wand with both arms, I (as Kat) 
fired a giant orb of magic straight into 
the Kobold King, completely eviscerat-
ing him from the face of the earth upon 
contact. Complete K.O. The table reacted 
gleefully, perhaps with a tinge of pride, at 
the newcomer who dealt the finishing 
blow on the tough boss. Afterward, I got 
to keep the wand in Kat’s inventory, a 
token of triumph. 


In the seven years since opening, 
the ECG community has been a revolv-
ing door. Fantastic explains: “We have 
some people that think they’re coming 
here temporarily and ended up staying a 
long time and other people who are here 
from the start of the first semester and 
then, two days after graduation, they’re 
gone. We see people that come to visit 
again, [although] they may have moved 
away three years ago.” 


Though Brenda lives a town over 
and can’t drive, she makes it a point to 
visit the store whenever she can. “I’ve 
tried to duck back in because finding 
a truly safe and accepting place in the 
gaming community—or in life in gen-
eral—is hard as hell for me sometimes.” 
For her, and for quite a few other regu-
lars who commute from out of town, the 
inclusivity at ECG is worth it. 


Come May, I’ll be moving out of 
New Haven. I might not see the guys I 
played my very first game of DnD with 
again (Michael, Andrew, Terry, Roman, 
Patrick, and Snee), but we’ve formed 
a Discord thread named Kobold Cave. 
I like the idea that I’m still tethered to 
them in some way, and that the Kobold 
Cave we surmounted lingers somewhere 
out there, no matter what. 


As we wrap up our conversation on 
a quiet Sunday afternoon, Fantastic has 
to leave and greet their guests—friends 
from a now-defunct gaming conven-
tion, coming to catch up over a round of 
games. “We’re a social club built around 
games,” Fantastic grins as we walk out, 
“[but we’re] community first.” ∎

**Title: Unlearning Surveillance**
**Author: Elisa Cruz**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Less than a mile from Yale’s central campus stands my alma mater Hill Regional Career High School. 
There, it was normal to have a security guard blow a whistle in my face and bark at me and  my friends to go to class because our lunch conversation lingered for a minute after the bell rang. School resource officers (SROs) patrolled the hallways, lunchrooms, and even bathrooms. Amidst this surveillance, I was confronted every day by the school’s lack of resources. Teachers often bought class materials out of pocket. The building lacked proper air conditioning. Hardly any school psychologists existed to match the needs of students. It was hard to accept that within this tight budget, money was used to fund more policing rather than more material support. 

Starting in 1994, New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) established the SRO program—the integration of a police officer into school—to increase both security and support within school districts. SROs differ from security guards in that they are armed police officers. While security guards are not sworn police officers, they still participate in the surveillance of schools. 
There’s a lack of available public data on SROs, including an explanation for what prompted NHPS to implement SROs in the first place. Now, the SRO program spans seventy school districts across Connecticut.

From my first day as an NHPS student, I was readily aware of our SROs and security guards. Our SRO was usually stationed downstairs, monitoring students as we walked through the metal detector. We also saw SROs outside in our hallways and bathrooms. I wondered if everyday tasks like finding a bathroom or walking to class needed to be policed. Whether we liked it or not, NHPS students were constantly confronted with surveillance. Yet it wasn’t until I was a junior that I was introduced to our psychologist and social workers. In some sense, it was clear who the New Haven Board of Education (NHBOE) wanted us to know. 

While SROs never approached me in a standoffish manner, I likely benefited from being labeled as “good”—I was heavily involved with extracurriculars and close with staff, meaning I was not labeled an “at-risk” kid. I am a Southeast Asian woman, a demographic that doesn’t bear the main brunt of racialized police brutality. However, I still stood in solidarity with students who felt uncomfortable around SROs and what the SROs represented: a system that allows officers to be brutal. This mainly stems from the sheer power they have over us—students, but most importantly, kids. 

Last year, I witnessed our SRO—a fully armed police officer—slam a teenage girl against a brick wall, handcuff her, and lead her into a police car after a school fight. My school’s SRO was twice the age and size of the girl. I cringed watching him seamlessly slam her against the wall. More concerning, we never received an explanation for the severity of the SRO’s actions. I found this lack of transparency strange. How were we to rely on SROs for safety when their actions seemed so arbitrary? Aside from the violence, the sight of an SRO’s navy blue uniform and police badge will always create discomfort for students who have witnessed police brutality—either in their own lives or through the media. SROs will always be a symbol of fear even if they are not always putting their hands on teenagers. 

In my school and beyond it, students began organizing against SROs. Citywide Youth Coalition is a group of NHPS students demanding disinvestment in SROs and reinvestment in mental health support. Citywide hosted a district-wide walkout last May, where I joined a crowd of seven hundred students from thirteen high schools across New Haven. Chants of “Care not cops!” rang through the streets, and the protest pressured the NHBOE to actualize their plan promised back in April 2021: to implement more




**Title: Searching for a Safe Place**
**Author: Elisa Cruz**
**Page number(s): 7-9**

“You can’t be in your 
neighborhood without the 
police being there and can’t 
be at school either,” Jamila 
Washington, 
a 
20-year-old 
community organizer for City-
wide, told me. “So, where’s your 
safe place?” 

Seven years ago, Washing-
ton started organizing with 
Citywide after being invited by 
a friend to join Citywide’s “Dinner and 
Dialogue,” a program where New Haven 
residents have round table discussions 
about social issues over a meal. She told me 
she joined Citywide as a “socially anxious” 
NHPS student, but as we talked and joked, I 
could see the joyful and confident 20-year-
old community organizer she’d grown to 
be. 

Washington doesn’t support SROs 
in schools due to her lived experiences 
in NHPS, but her distrust in the system 
builds upon a growing body of informa-
tion. Research by Connecticut Voices 
for Children demonstrates that SROs do 
not make schools measurably safer or 
improve academic outcomes, but their 
presence does greatly increase the number 
of students arrested each school year—
feeding the school-to-prison pipeline. In 
the 2018 to 2019 school year, Black and 
Latine students were three times and one 
point six times more likely, respectively, to 
be arrested than their white counterparts. 
The average percentage of Black students 
arrested in schools with SROs present was 
over seventeen percent higher than those 
without SROs. In this sense, SROs seem to 
be more adept in criminalizing  students—
the main demographic of NHPS—than 
creating a safer school.


Even then, the NHPD is no stranger to 
such brutality, employing officers like those 
who left Randy Cox paralyzed in June 2022 
and tackled Shawn Marshall, a bipolar 
man, during a manic episode in January 
2021. This danger extends to SROs, employ-
ees in the same system. Upon a simple 
Google search, I found an Instagram pro-
motional video from my SRO urging peo-
ple to become good leaders for the New 
Haven youth. But the link before it was an 
article about a New Haven police officer 
who assaulted a man at a Fairfield bar. A 
mixture of shock and discomfort contorted 
my face as I confirmed that the police offi-
cer charged with this violent encounter was 
the same one who roamed our hallways. I 
found it almost dystopian to see this dual-
ity play out side-by-side online. There have 
been too many instances in which police 
officers have been unnecessarily aggres-
sive for me to find it possible to connect 
with them. 

Washington works alongside Alyssa 
Marie Cajigas, a director of the Citywide 
Youth Coalition. Cajigas is an NHPS 
alumna who has since dedicated her time 
to community organizing with Citywide. 
As she chats with me enthusiastically about 
the work Citywide continues to do, her 
love for the NHPS community is evident. 
“We believe that violence should never 
be the answer,” Cajigas told me, “and 
police should never be the first resort for 
discipline in schools.” She explained how 
police were called to address nonviolent 
situations such as a class interruption, 
which could easily be mended with proper 
social support.


A 
dual 
enrollment 
student 
at 
Hillhouse High School and Yale, Elsa 
Holahan, echoed Cajigas’s worries 
about policing. Perhaps she owes 
her conviction to her mother, who 
is a social worker, or to her own 
belief in schools where students “feel 
heard and create their most authen-
tic self.” Regardless, Holahan chose 
to walk out to the Citywide’s protest 
last May. 

“There are power dynamics 
and it disrupts trust,” Holahan said 
about SROs before referring to the 
broader police system. “Students 
have had negative experiences 
and trauma.” 

Holahan’s words remind me of 
Washington’s story about a teacher 
at her school would threaten to call 
SROs against the typecasted “bad” 
students—including 
those 
who 
skipped class often—to get them to 
“behave.” Holahan is adamant about 
the removal of SROs from Hillhouse. 
After seeing the police cars parked 
outside and knowing there are stu-
dents who have had negative experi-
ences with the gun-wielding SRO, Holahan 
finds it impossible to ever develop any 
relationship with SROs. After all, there is 
no police officer roaming the hallways 
of the Humanities Quadrangle at Yale—
another place where Holahan attends class. 
I couldn’t help but chuckle at her joke that 
SROs are “glorified hall monitors.” I asked 
her if it would be possible to connect with 
SROs on an emotional level. Without hes-
itating a second, Holahan confidently 
answered “No,” before we both giggled at 
her eagerness. 

But Cajigas emphasized that estab-
lishing a connection with SROs—whether 
a friendly relationship or one for mental 
support—can feel like the only option for 
some students when the officers are the 
most accessible and visible choice. “There 
is [almost] no other resources for students 
in the schools . . . to look for support and 
peer mentorship,” Cajigas told me. “Of 
course, they’re gonna rely on the only sys-
tem available.”


Cajigas noted that despite these pos-
itive relationships formed out of necessity, 
SROs are part of an oppressive system that 
is tied to even the well-intended people: 
“The truth is that Black and Brown folks are 
oppressed because of a system, not because 
of individuals. These individuals just so 
happen to be a part of a horrible system.” 

Within this complicated web 
of systemic fault but individual 
kindness, SROs do embody useful support 
systems for some members of NHPS. But 
these views often come with acknowledg-
ments of the tension between individual 
trust and trust of the larger institution of 
the police force. 

“I think he’s a nice person,” Ayush Patel, 
a senior at Hill Regional Career High 
School, says about his SRO. “We were set-
ting up for a robotics event, and he was 
able to find a table for us.” 

I saw a piece of myself in Patel. We 
both went to a predominantly white pri-
mary school and, as a result, we didn’t expe-
rience the surveillance of SROs until high 
school. His face tenses up as he scratches 
the back of his neck. He hesitantly admits 
that “[SRO presence] feels somewhat 
protective, but the fear of just weapons in 
general in school—even if it’s not within 
students—it’s just frightening.” 

Patel’s experience highlights a con-
tradiction. He knows that his SRO is not 
inherently evil. At the same time, he feels 
troubled knowing the SRO wields a gun 
and taser—weapons that disproportion-
ately harm people who look like him and 
his peers. 

Some students sympathize with New 
Haven’s vision of SROs and believe that 
they are effective protectors. Alex Aguirre, 
a junior at Hill Regional Career High 
School, recalls when a student got jumped 
by a group of other students during school 
dismissal. He believes that his SRO acted 
as a sign of “authority that can actually 
stop them [fighters],” and pulled students 
away, ultimately intervening midway 
through the fight. Aguirre views sros as 
the second line of intervention—only 
there if something “crazy” such as phys-
ical altercations happens, while social 
workers can deal with the “small” issues 
such as arguments.


A school psychologist I spoke with, 
who requested to remain anonymous due 
to concern over the security of their job, 
explained that they view social workers, 
school psychologists, and SROs all as a team 
of trusted adults. This team, in theory, acts 
as social support for students and reaches 
out based on whatever the student’s 
individual needs. A safe school climate, 
according to the psychologist, comes from 
building relationships between teachers 
and the mental health support team. The 
psychologist expressed a fervent hope for 
increased mental health support as a way 
to provide more time and care for students’ 
specific needs. More importantly, they 
underscored that the students’ opinions in 
this conversation about SROs and mental 
health support will ultimately be the most 
vital, as they are the biggest stakeholders in 
this conversation. 

Like the school psychologist, Patel 
and Aguirre both seemed to agree that 
SROs represent a degree of safety within 
NHPS. In a perverse cycle, however, this 
safety is temporary. We often observed a 
fight, saw the SRO and security guards help 
break it up, and then waited for the next 
one. Watching this, many students came to 
associate SROs with safety since they were a 
reactionary measure to immediately resolve 
a situation. But even if SROs do break up 
school fights, the underlying roots of this 
violence are not resolved. Often the fight 
continues off school grounds—including 
near our school bodega, where I’ve seen 
student videos circulating. 

Despite differing views on SROs, both 
Patel and Aguirre supported Citywide’s 
protest, with Aguirre attending in solidar-
ity with his friends who demanded better 
mental health support. Across their vary-
ing stances on SROs, the students I spoke 
with all just wanted to feel safe at schools 
and have an investment in more mental 
health services. 

Dr. Wendy Decter, a teacher who 
recently left NHPS after seventeen years, 
echoed 
these 
fundamental 
concerns. 
Decter explained how an ideal world 
would have more mental health resources 
to keep kids on track. She emphasized the 
importance of having as many people in 
school buildings to make student life eas-
ier. She hopes that SROs can be a reassur-
ing presence for people as they are another 
route of adult support for students. She 
noted that some SROs become ingrained 
into the community, becoming familiar 
with students and their families. 

“I think the SRO was a wonderful 
resource, they knew [students] from a 
totally different perspective than the teach-
ers and the school administration,” Decter 
said, alluding to the idea that SROs come 
from students’ own communities. “There 
should have been hiring of as many social 
workers, school counselors, school psy-
chologists as possible, and making them as 
available to the students in school as easily 
as they could be made.” 

Within the status quo, some still 
believe the police to be the most effective 
form of safety. This is despite the fact that, 
as Cajigas pointed out, SROs have not been 
able to deter school shootings, even as far 
back as Columbine. In a hundred ninety- 
seven instances of gun violence at U.S. 
schools since 1999, SROs intervened suc-
cessfully in only three instances. 

When I imagine a safer and more 
just school, I envision a police-free 
space. Imagining NHPS without SROs 
can be difficult because surveilled schools 
are all that the majority of my peers have 
experienced—we have gotten desensitized. 
While I have the privilege to draw upon my 
knowledge of an SRO-free school before 
high school, this position does not fix the 
widespread lack of students’ understanding 
about how the disinvestment in SROs will 
improve school health and culture.


At my middle school, much like 
NHPS, we would attend class, socialize with 
friends, and work in the library. But we did 
all these things without a police car parked 
alongside the school, police officers roam-
ing the halls, and entering through a metal 
detector. These two experiences still coexist 
with one another. I have friends who have 
never experienced police in their schools, 
while others view it as unquestionably the 
norm. This tension raises further questions 
as to why SROs are still viewed as trusted 
and necessary figures by some groups in 
the NHPS community. 

“What the hell does better New Haven 
Public Schools mean? For me, and for a lot 
of my peers, it means having schools that 
nourish our souls in a way that actually 
matters,” Dave Cruz Bustamante, a youth 
community organizer and current NHPS 
student told me.


This pattern of SROs’ surveillance hasn’t 
shifted much since my or Washington’s 
years at high school. Although more SROs 
are allocated in larger schools, the students 
I talked with revealed that it didn’t matter 
their student population: each school had 
only one to three social workers—the same 
way I left the school. 

With the staff’s limited numbers and 
emotional bandwidth, it seems inevita-
ble that NHPS students would experience 
mental exhaustion. Despite the seven hun-
dred student turnout at the Citywide pro-
test, Cruz Bustamante, who now serves as 
an NHBOE student representative, told me 
the NHBOE “is taking very small steps like 
revising the MOU with the police depart-
ment . . . almost not noticeable at all.” They 
even admitted that by the end of their term, 
nothing entirely revolutionary would likely 
be changed about SROs due to the bureau-
cratic inactivity in the NHBOE. 

Instead of relying on reactionary fig-
ures like SROs, NHPS should instead look 
to preventive measures including hiring 
more healthcare professionals. Mental 
health professionals can intercept an issue 
before it manifests into something more 
harmful. This is especially vital as those 
with incomes below the federal poverty 
threshold and  individuals, the main demo-
graphics of NHPS, are disproportionately 
represented in the American carceral and 
legal system. Cajigas and Citywide have 
set out to transform this inequity, especially 
within the context of legislative work. 

Washington and Cajigas both told me 
that their campaign against SROs is “only 
phase one”—they plan to rethink commu-
nity security as a whole. Cajigas explained 
that Citywide is reflecting on other forms 
of monitoring, including if older commu-
nity members were employed as monitors 
in the place of SROs and security guards. In 
practice, this intervention could look like a 
community member with no affiliation to 
the police entering the school, rather than 
pulling in outsider cops from neighboring 
towns. Cajigas emphasized the need for 
NHPS students to be served and protected 
by members of the same community, dis-
affiliated from a system that notoriously 
harms BIPOC.


As an NHPS alum, I’ve now become 
disconnected from the experience of SROs 
I had a year ago. I no longer have a fully 
armed police officer watching every move 
my peers and I make out of fear we will 
break into a fight. Security guards no lon-
ger view my lunch container as a “weapon” 
since it’s glass. Yale is only a fifteen-minute 
walk from my old high school, yet my sta-
tus as an Ivy League student has exempted 
me from being as surveilled by the police 
as I was in high school. At Yale, even when 
police roam around Cross Campus, they 
aren’t hounding students who are skipping 
lectures. The rationale behind this massive 
shift in surveillance has weighed on me.


Functioning for a year both at Yale 
and since the walkout prompted me to 
question whether we need SROs for a safe 
school environment. And though I went 
to an SRO-free school for most of my aca-
demic life, my four years in a surveilled 
school still linger within me. At my pre-
dominantly  high school, we would rarely 
have toilet paper and grew accustomed 
to seeing police cars when we walked in 
through a metal detector. Now, I inhabit 
the world of a predominantly white Ivy 
League where students know truffle season 
in Milan and the most consistent police 
presence is guarding the exit to our libraries.


Though I am what feels like a world 
away, I still carry the same habits I did in 
high school, unzipping all six zippers of my 
backpack for a security check in libraries 
and speeding up when I walk by police cars. 
I doubt I’ll lose them any time soon. ∎

To Care for a Community
Peer-led policing alternative COMPASS has seen 
a successful rollout in the past five months. But 
can an organization bankrolled by the City and 
run by Yale achieve radical aims? 


O
n the top floor of a converted 
Victorian home, in the heart of New 
Haven’s Dwight neighborhood, lives the 
city’s attempt at an alternative model to policing.
The old home is peaceful when I visit, its 
rooms awash in sunlight. Tenants putter from 
one floor to the next, their footsteps creaking 
against warm hardwood floors. This is a crisis 
respite house run by the nonprofit Continuum of 
Care, which provides refuge and short-term beds 
for people in crisis. “Some, but not enough,” says 
John Labieniec, one of multiple co-vice presi-
dents at the organization. 

Labieniec’s mild manner and casual dress—
sweatshirt, long hair tied back—fit right in as he 
guides me upstairs to what could be mistaken for 
an attic bedroom. In this room, a new organiza-
tion has moved in: Elm City COMPASS, short for 
“Compassionate Allies Serving Our Streets.” The 
initiative has been years in the making, envisioned 
as a clinician- and peer-led alternative to tradi-
tional policing in mental health and substance use 
crises. COMPASS has worked with three hundred 
and four people since its November 2022 launch 
(as of March 1), through a mix of responding to 
911 calls and conducting proactive outreach.

Although COMPASS’s office has a distinctly 
cozy and communal feel, New Haven’s biggest 
institutional forces are at work in this Dwight 
home. Yale University manages COMPASS in a 
partnership with the New Haven city govern-
ment, having secured $3.5 million of city and 
federal funding to administer the program. Yet, 
Yale’s name has been largely omitted from the 
COMPASS rollout.

COMPASS is one of the few initiatives across 
the country that is tangibly moving toward peer-
based alternatives to policing. Yet its collaboration 
with New Haven police and its integration with 
some of New Haven’s most entrenched institu-
tions—the city government and Yale University—
alienates 
some 
long-time 
harm 
reduction 
advocates. COMPASS’s launch then begs the ques-
tion: can an organization meant to disrupt the 
policing system still do so in collaboration with 
mainstream institutional mammoths?

AN ALTERNATIVE TO POLICING

C
OMPASS emerged from a time of “multi-
ple pandemics,” Jack Tebes, COMPASS director 
and Yale Professor of Psychiatry, told me, “one 
hundreds of years old and one more recent.”

Tebes’ two pandemics—one being centuries 
of racism and police brutality, and the other being 
COVID-19—intertwined in the summer of 2020, 
as masked protestors marched in the streets and 
called for police abolition in the wake of George 
Floyd’s murder. In response, the city of New 
Haven appropriated funds for a civilian crisis 
response team that would follow a new model of 
law enforcement and community care, soliciting 
applications from organizations up for the task. 
Tebes and his colleagues at Yale’s Consultation 
Center had long worked on crisis response 
matters and were selected to spearhead the 
new initiative. 

In the years of planning ahead of COMPASS’s 
launch, the initiative strove to involve New Haven 
residents as much as possible. Representatives 
from the city and Yale conducted focus groups 
and community forums, ultimately consulting 
more than two hundred and fifty community 
members, according to its website. Yale also sub-
contracted with Continuum of Care, long estab-
lished in the world of New Haven crisis response, 
to provide what Labieniec calls “boots on the 
ground” for the COMPASS operation. With this 
collaboration, Labieniec became the coordinator 
of COMPASS’s crisis response team.

COMPASS was slated to begin in mid-2021, but 
the launch was delayed over four times as the 
city struggled to find a subcontractor and final-
ize its contract with Yale. The city also contended 
with police and fire unions who wanted to bar-
gain over COMPASS’s plan of operation and the 
role that police and fire officials would play in its 
implementation. In August 2022, the police union 
filed a state labor board complaint saying that the 
city was going forward with the COMPASS launch 
without providing the launch plans to police. 
Ultimately the bargaining was resolved, but it did 
delay COMPASS’s launch yet again through the 
later half of 2022.

When the crisis response operation did 
launch, it did so in the form of a “secondary 
response” team, one that would only go out on a 
call if requested by police and fire operations. This 
ongoing collaboration with police, although tem-
porary, is leaving its mark.

In March, when city officials and police 
arrived at the West River, off Ella T. Grasso 
Boulevard, to clear the three-year-old Tent City 
encampment, COMPASS’s signature green jackets 
were present alongside them. As bulldozers rolled 
over the tents that had once housed sixteen peo-
ple, the COMPASS team members worked to find 
beds for those who were getting evicted. One 
Tent City resident, Barry Lawson, told The New 
Haven Register: “I was going to get arrested, but 
then I got offered a place [to stay] on Edgewood” 
by the COMPASS team.

Despite the care COMPASS provided, in 
moments like the Tent City clearing, said hous-
ing advocate Mark Colville, “the roles get a little 
weird.” Colville’s organization, Amistad Catholic 
Worker, is based nearby in The Hill neighborhood 
and helped organize and sustain Tent City for 
years. He believes that COMPASS’s alignment with 
the city during the mass eviction—even while 
they were just administering care to the evicted—
exemplifies the danger of a harm reduction

To Care for a Community
Amistad Catholic Worker runs a house to which anyone can 
come eat, pray, and receive donations. Following the Tent City 
demolition, they also allow unhoused people to camp in the 
backyard. The organization’s mission statement reads: “We 
seek to be a safe haven and a public nonviolent witness in our 
neighborhood, and always try to blur the distinction between 
the people who are serving and those being served.”


“That’s what we’re doing here, and we simply need the 
city to get out of the way and let us show them how to do it,” 
Colville emphasized.


At COMPASS, crisis response occurs only after police refer-
ral, generating a major departure from Colville’s model. Yet 
organization that works alongside police and city government.


“What I saw [during the Tent City clearing] was peo-
ple from COMPASS accompanied by police in uniform and 
with guns. So to me, that sort of invalidates the whole thing,” 
Colville explained to me over the phone.


Colville’s model of community care is different from 
COMPASS’s, as he lives in a home directly alongside those he 
works with, including the former residents of Tent City. This 
generates a horizontal model of care in which neighbors help 
neighbors—without necessitating the involvement of police. 
People who are unhoused from all over the state come 
to The Hill, Colville says, because “we take care of our own.”

there are aspects of COMPASS that do resemble forms of hor-
izontal community care, such as the involvement of peers on 
their response teams. Two people from COMPASS respond to 
crisis calls: a licensed clinician and a peer recovery specialist 
who has experienced homelessness and/or substance use. 
Between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., each two-person COMPASS 
team can respond to a call in an average of thirteen minutes. 
When they do, COMPASS peer recovery specialist Nanette 
Campbell told me over the phone, the clinician will often take 
the immediate lead on crisis response, while the peer is there to 
relate to those in crisis and approach them in a more accessible 
manner than police or clinicians may be able to do. 
Campbell is the primary peer on the COMPASS team and 
has been working in the field of peer crisis response for twenty 
years. She emphasized the importance of having a peer respond 
to a crisis, rather than just a clinician or an armed force:


“It’s just different walks of life, and [police] don’t know 
what we know as far as mental health issues, substance issues,” 
Campbell told me, exhaustion in her voice at the end of her 
work day. “Me myself, I’ve lived that life. So just knowing about 
different things and what people are going through and meet-
ing them where they are.”


COMPASS also does proactive outreach to areas that it 
deems crisis hotspots: “where there are drug overdoses, folks 
who look like they’re in need, folks who may be congregating 
during cold winter weather and may need to get to a warming 
center,” Tebes explained. During these outreach sessions, the 
two-person team distributes care packages and can respond 
if they see someone in distress. These efforts tend to be con-
centrated on the New Haven Green, along a stretch of Ella T. 
Grasso Boulevard in the Edgewood and West River neighbor-
hoods, and at the end of the Boulevard south of The Hill. All 
are majority BIPOC and low-income neighborhoods with the 
exception of the Green, where demographics are affected by its 
close proximity to Yale.


COMPASS conducts its outreach without any police presence. 
Yet Colville feels like the ongoing partnership with police—
especially given that it is the only way the group responds to 
crisis calls—keeps COMPASS from being able to help in areas 
that do not want a police presence.


“I doubt that anyone on my block, except for me, is really 
aware that [COMPASS] is a thing,” Colville told me with a sigh. 
“That’s fine, you know, it’s in its infancy. But in this neighbor-
hood . . . we have a standing policy here, we don’t call the police. 
So who knows if we will ever see [COMPASS].”


Both Tebes and Labieniec made it clear that this second-
ary response phase is temporary, and that there are plans for 
COMPASS to independently respond to crisis calls as soon as this 
summer. However, COMPASS would still remain a part of the 911 
system. Tebes explained that Public Safety Answering Points 
(PSAP), which runs the 911 dispatch, would direct relevant 911 
calls to COMPASS rather than uniformed police. In order to 
reach that point, however, COMPASS must collect enough data 
to understand where it would succeed as a solo actor, and with 
that data, draw up a standard to be used by 911 dispatchers. 
This data comes with time, and the more COMPASS referrals 
that come from police and fire officials, the more useful this 
data can become.


“In New Haven, it was always planned that COMPASS would 
grow into that [independent role],” Labieniec said. But that 
process takes time. Labieniec has traveled and met with leaders 
from Colorado and Iowa’s statewide non-police crisis response 
systems. And in both cases, “it was a process” to become disen-
tangled from their existing police systems. 


“If you’re not in it, you don’t realize how complicated it is,” 
Labieniec said.


On a later call, I asked him if he was concerned that the 
current phase of police partnership might alienate communi-
ties like Colville’s in The Hill. He responded that it would be 
impossible to get this project off the ground without collabo-
rating with police. In order to help those in crisis, he believes 
the project needs to begin—even if it starts with the police.


“I don’t think you can effectively do what everyone is seek-
ing for us to do without collaborating at some extent with 
everyone. And I think that includes the police,” Labieniec said 
emphatically. “If we don’t have positive relationships with the 
police and with the city and with everyone, we’re not going to 
be as successful for the people that actually need the help.”


Labieniec and Campbell both expressed to me their belief 
in the ways that COMPASS has helped, and will continue to 
help, people on the individual level. Campbell described a 
woman who refers to the team as “her saving angels” after they 
helped her get clean. Labieniec pointed me to a New Haven 
Independent story about a woman who COMPASS helped safely 
relocate off the street.


But COMPASS is not just the two-person response team, nor 
the house in Dwight. It is also an experiment in policing alter-
natives that is continuously debated in City Hall and litigated 
by Yale and city lawyers. And at that macro level, some activ-
ists have begun to grow concerned—even those looking past 
police presence.


**Title: UNDER THE SHADOW OF YALE AND THE CITY**

UNDER THE SHADOW OF YALE AND THE CITY
B
ehind COMPASS’s slow, methodical, and data-driven 
approach to policing alternatives—an approach that frus-
trates more radical, anti-police advocates like Colville—is Yale 
and the New Haven government. 
Last spring, Yale quietly became a driving force behind 
the COMPASS project. A publicly available, 36-page contract 
between Yale and the city shows that, in exchange for over $3.5 
million in funding, Yale agreed to set up and run COMPASS for 
at least three years. More specifically, The Consultation Center 
at Yale University, which Tebes runs, would subcontract with 
Continuum of Care to launch the COMPASS team, and would 
then be able to collect data from the initiative for research pur-
poses. This data includes COMPASS’s clients’ demographics like 
race, ethnicity, gender identity, and income—all of which Yale 
collects and shares with New Haven.


The Consultation Center has, for the last forty years, 
researched best practices for mental health crisis interven-
tion, according to a video on the center’s website. The cen-
ter partners with external organizations or bases projects off 
of affiliated faculties’ needs. One of these projects included 
running a culture and diversity training for the New Haven 
Police Department.


According to Tebes, Yale has made in-kind contributions, 
such as new hires and equipment, that will amount to up to

$750,000 over the three-year duration of the con-
tract. Continuum of Care has made additional 
in-kind contributions that will total around 
three hundred thousand dollars, Tebes said. As 
COMPASS’s main representative from Yale, Tebes 
manages the entire budget.

The partnership between the city and Yale, 
and the lack of publicity surrounding the matter, 
raised alarm bells for some. In May 2022, when 
the contract became public, Nichole Roxas and 
Alice Shen, two former Yale Psychiatry resi-
dents published an op-ed in The New Haven 
Independent titled “COMPASS Critics To City: Be 
Transparent.” They wrote that “as two community 
psychiatrists, our patients tell us they do not trust 
the police in New Haven and, more than that, 
they do not trust Yale.”

“How did Yale sneak in on the cut? Did the 
city solicit community input about who would 
receive the money and how it would be spent? 
Would reported concerns be addressed?” the 
pair asked. 

When I asked Tebes similar questions, he 
pointed to COMPASS’s Community Advisory 
Board as an important check on Yale’s involve-
ment. The board currently contains nineteen New 
Haven residents from all walks of life, including 
one unhoused person. It meets four times a year 
in addition to separate small-group meetings and 
comes to decisions via group consensus on pol-
icies ranging from maintenance of the COMPASS 
website to what community resources it should 
provide. These meetings, according to Tebes, also 
ensure that Yale does not make any unilateral pol-
icy changes.

“We begin with humility, listening to com-
munity members, sharing any credit, centering 
our community, not centering Yale or ourselves,” 
Tebes added.

Faced with those same questions in the 
COMPASS office, Labieniec thought for a moment, 
and then quietly shared that he has not seen 
COMPASS’s affiliation with Yale as an alienating 
force when COMPASS helps out in the community. 
“There’s been nothing but warm, welcoming, pos-
itive excitement,” he said. “I personally have not 
seen anything, and I’m very involved.” Labieniec 
oversees the team every day, and occasionally 
accompanies them on calls.

Colville would say otherwise. In his opin-
ion, by taking up a huge amount of city land and 
then refusing to use their forty-two billion dol-
lar endowment to help the citizens they displace, 
Yale has become a catalyst of homelessness and 
poverty in New Haven, making their sponsorship 
of COMPASS come across as too little, too late.

“It is the university and the city government 
that are sort of colluding in promoting this myth 
of scarcity,” Colville said, “as if land and resources 
are too scarce to take care of the most low-in-
come people among us.”

Unlike Colville, David Agosta, a New Haven 
disability rights activist and former member of 
COMPASS’s Community Advisory Board, takes no 
issue with Yale’s involvement in COMPASS. “We 
recognize that Yale has the smartest people in the 
world,” he said. “When they do something right, 
they do it right.”

Yet Agosta recently resigned from the board 
due to frustration with a different partnering 
institution: the city of New Haven. Although he 
repeatedly expressed his admiration for every-
one involved in COMPASS, Agosta said that he 
could not remain on the board so long as the city 
refused to provide adequate beds and services for 
people without housing. He likened the COMPASS 
project, with the lack of current city resources for 
unhoused people, as “building a structure without 
a foundation.”

“It’s not about COMPASS; it’s that the mayor 
has not done his part to allow COMPASS to suc-
ceed. That’s why I resigned,” Agosta said. “If you 
talk to the folks there, there was evident frustra-
tion at the fact that there was no housing. You 
can’t really talk about it from the inside, so I had 
to do it from the outside.”

Colville also expressed concern at the city’s 
involvement with the project. Despite everything, 
he sees COMPASS as “a good concept.” However, 
he is critical of the current framework of New 
Haven’s government, and that within it, COMPASS 
will be unable to turn into the radical alternative 
to policing that it was originally envisioned to be.

“This happens all the time in New Haven,” he 
told me. “Is this just another liberal idea that usu-
ally tends to fizzle out at some point, especially 
when the cops start pushing back or when we get 
the next ‘law and order’ mayor?”

The 
current 
contract 
only 
guarantees 
COMPASS’s funding through June 2025, at which 
point New Haven, Yale, and Continuum of Care 
will have to renegotiate. A mayoral election is 
approaching, and as time passes from when 
public calls for policing alternatives had peaked 
in 2020, it is possible that COMPASS’s funding 
could dry up.

If it does, Labieniec will not let that mark the 
end of the initiative. Although Yale and the city 
of New Haven are large conglomerates, whose 
whims could change when it’s time to renew 
the contract in 2025, Continuum of Care is still 
a grassroots organization, and it is committed to 
COMPASS for the long run. Labieniec told me that 
he has already looked into alternative grants that 
could keep COMPASS up and running, should New 
Haven or Yale step out of the picture. 

“Our agency is invested in this,” he said. 

A solely nonprofit version of COMPASS, with-
out the financial backing of the city or the data-
driven work of Yale, might look radically different. 
A non-Yale, non-governmental COMPASS would 
be missing a significant and consistent source 
of funding, the guidance of a city-run advisory 
board, and the data-driven operational approach 

“It is the 
university 
and the city 
government 
that are sort 
of colluding
 in promoting 
this myth
 of scarcity,”

the end of the summer. And with that time passing, Labieniec 
and Tebes both said, collaborations should continue to grow 
between COMPASS and the myriad harm reduction and home-
lessness organizations that exist in New Haven.
“We want to create the structure that this will be able to be 
going on for years to come,” Tebes said. “It’s very rewarding. It’s 
difficult, but it’s a good kind of difficult that we all want to do.”
But speaking to me from a communal home in The Hill, 
rather than a Yale office, Colville’s doubts remain unassuaged.
“Until [Yale and the city government] change their policies, 
I don’t see how they can be part of the solution,” said Colville.

hell out of the way.” ∎

But it might not have the same incentives to work closely with 
police, and could instead call directly on the city to provide 
more housing services and beds, as Agosta wants. Meanwhile, 
there would be a greater emphasis on Continuum of Care’s 
horizontal modes of aid, including the peer response team 
and the location of their respite centers.. This is the version of 
COMPASS that resembles a radical nonprofit organization—the 
version that is on full display in the Dwight attic office.

Yale’s CCE program aims to revolutionize campus sexual
its student-led approach raises crucial questions about


**Title: OSURE**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At the start of the Spring 2022 
semester, K. was sexually assaulted. 
They can’t recount everything that hap-
pened that night, due to the impacts of 
alcohol and post-traumatic stress disorder, 
but they remember meeting an older student from a 
campus club they were in at a fraternity party. They 
talked. It was suggestive. The two went back to his 
room. They weren’t in the right state of being to con-
sent—and they didn’t consent.

K. had also just started their new job on cam-
pus. As a Communication and Consent Educator 
(CCE), they’d spend the rest of the semester attend-
ing trainings hosted by institutions like Title IX, 
planning events to educate students about sex-
ual misconduct, and flipping through readings in 
preparation for weekly CCE meetings—all in the 
hopes of creating a healthier social and sexual cul-
ture at Yale. After they were raped in high school, K. 
spent years working to build more supportive struc-
tures for survivors of sexual assault at their school 
and local community. The opportunity to continue 
this with Yale’s CCE program was a large factor in 
their decision to enroll. 

Specifically, K. kept working to make Yale a 
more comfortable environment for survivors of 
sexual violence with the CCE Survivor Support 
team, one of four “project groups” that CCEs serve in 
alongside their respective residential colleges. 

Despite their time learning about and educat-
ing others on sexual misconduct as a CCE, they had 
trouble recognizing their own experience of sexual 
assault. They’d only begun processing the events of 
that night several months later on a summer trip 
to Europe—when they weren’t “CCE-ing,” they told 
me. Although they’d started to come to terms with 
their experience that summer, they tried to keep 
their trauma out of sight and out of mind come fall 
semester, avoiding thinking or speaking about it.

Editor’s note: K. requested that their identity be 
anonymized due to the sensitivity of their story.


In retrospect, K. asked: “Why do I not give 
myself the same care and concern as I would give 
literally any of my friends . . . especially as some-
one who is paid to talk about these kinds of things 
with people?”


The CCE program emerged partly in response 
to widespread scrutiny of Yale’s sexual climate 
both on and off campus. The program signaled 
an accountability shift inwards—toward a peer-to-
peer system managing sexual misconduct and away 
from the more bare bones administrative Title IX 
procedures.

Melanie Boyd, Yale College Dean of Student 
Affairs, helped launch the program in August 
2011, about four months after the Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) began 
investigating Yale for violating Title IX rules. The 
headline-making Title IX complaint, raised by a 
group of sixteen Yale students and alumni, alleged 
that the University fostered a hostile sexual climate 
and mishandled several cases of misconduct in 
recent years. 

The complaint highlighted several campus 
events, many of which remain infamous at Yale 
more than a decade later. In 2008, Zeta Psi pledges 
held a sign reading “We love Yale sluts!” outside of 
the Women’s Center. In 2009, male students circu-
lated the “preseason scouting report,” a mass email 
ranking dozens of female first-years by how many 
beers it would take to sleep with them. And in 
October 2010, pledges of the Delta Kappa Epsilon 
fraternity (DKE) marched around Old Campus 
chanting “No means yes, yes means anal!” and other 
misogynistic remarks.

The day after the 2010 DKE incident, Boyd’s 
Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) 
seminar “Theorizing Sexual Violence” met at 
their usual time and place at the Hall of Graduate 
Studies, which is now the Humanities Quandrangle. 
But instead of discussing the week’s scheduled cur-
riculum, the Yale Daily News reported, Boyd urged 
students to reflect on a “script-breaking response” 
to campus sexual violence and imagine communi-
ty-oriented ways to respond to such incidents. 

Later that year, the University’s Task Force 
on Sexual Misconduct Education and Prevention, 
composed of Yale faculty, convened in response to 
the DKE incident. They released a report recom-
mending that Yale “expand the pool of well-sup-
ported, well-educated student educators” and “raise 
the level of student knowledge through mandatory 
educational programs,” among other ideas. While 
the CCE program began to take shape, Yale adopted 
a flurry of other sexual misconduct response pro-
grams, including the University-Wide Committee 
on Sexual Misconduct (UWC), which investigates 
and adjudicates sexual misconduct cases.

A proposed CCE program, according to Interim 
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Director of 
the Office of Gender and Campus Culture (OGCC) 
Eilaf Elmileik, “grew out of ” Boyd’s WGSS seminar 
in the fall of 2020. Though the News reported that 
the seminar discussed the DKE incident and that 
the program came amid the flurry of Yale’s respon-
sive actions, Elmileik denied connection to the 
public uproar.

The first class of CCEs trained for their new roles 
in the summer of 2011. They held their inaugural 
first-year orientation workshops that fall.

“These are difficult issues and require frank, 
thoughtful conversations—the kind of discussions 
students are often most willing to have with other 
students,” Boyd stated in a News article when the 
CCE program first kicked off. 

Today, the student-led CCE program, which 
the OGCC oversees, stands unique among other 
sexual misconduct education and support systems 
at Yale. More than fifty undergraduates, distrib-
uted throughout all fourteen residential colleges 
and diverse areas of student life, serve as CCEs. In 
an effort to change the campus’ social and sex-
ual climate as a whole, they hold “interventions,” 
including informal conversations and more for-
mal workshops, like the mandatory Bystander 
Intervention training for first-years. 

Deputy Title IX Coordinator Katie Shirley 
wrote to me that the Title IX office provides “guid-
ance” on the primary content of CCE workshops. 
But it is typically fellow undergraduates that are 
responsible for educating their peers on how to pre-
vent sexual violence themselves—despite the heavy 
topics at hand and the complex web of sexual mis-
conduct policies and response systems at Yale. The 
University’s professionally staffed programs like 
Title IX and the Sexual Harassment and Assault 
Response & Education center (SHARE), which 
provides crisis support, counseling, and health and 
wellness care referrals for survivors, take a more 
indirect role in outreach.

Title IX offers its own customizable workshops 
and training for campus organizations that request 
them, according to its website. Shirley did not 
address my inquiry into what Title IX’s own train-
ing looks or whether these are mandatory for stu-
dents on their own. CCE Zoe Kanga ’24, who is on 
the Title IX Student Advisory Committee, told me 
that there are opportunities for students to speak 
directly with the Title IX office about sexual mis-
conduct at Yale, but that these opportunities aren’t 
well advertised beyond CCEs’ workshops with first-
year students. 

“We do, of course, advertise those resources 
during our interventions. But I think after that it 
kind of falls out,” Kanga said. “And I doubt that 
anyone in their junior year after experiencing some-
thing is going to go dig through their archives and 
find that one slip of paper that they received in their 
CCE training first year.”

In her email to me, Shirley only described 
opportunities for student leaders employed by 
Yale—including CCEs, First-Year Counselors, Peer 
Liaisons, and Transfer Peer Advisors—to speak with 
her during open office hours. She added that she is 
available to meet with CCEs one-on-one if they are 
interested in speaking about a particular area of the 


As their fall semester back to campus con-
tinued, K. couldn’t control the visceral reaction 
they felt when they saw their assailant in spaces 
they once felt safe in. Right before Thanksgiving 
break, they began speaking with Shirley, whom they 
were familiar with through CCE training, to secure a 
no-contact agreement between themselves and their 
assailant. They’d learned a little about no-contact 
measures through CCE training, but the intricacies of 
the process were still unclear. 

Initially, K. believed that visiting the Title IX 
office would fix all of their problems. As a CCE, they 
directed people to the office all the time. But as they 
sat across from Shirley at each meeting, tackling the 
logistics of academic accommodations and social 
arrangement conditions in the new no-contact 
agreement, K. gradually understood they weren’t 
going to receive the emotional relief they needed. 

Title IX’s supportive measures—and all of their 
limits—are laid out to CCEs during training and 
made accessible on the office’s website. Shirley and 
most Title IX administrators aren’t trained as thera-
pists. Despite this, K. came into the process expect-
ing more support than logistical accommodations. 
They’d ultimately walk away emotionally unsatisfied, 
even though they’d later describe their experience 
in itself as “neutral.”

When students come to CCEs with disclosures 
of sexual misconduct, CCEs respond with a script 
designed by the OGCC. Usually, the CCE begins by 
informing the survivor that they are an educator, 
not a counselor. They emphasize that they’re avail-
able as support, but they aren’t trained to give advice 
or to offer solutions themselves. As someone talks 
through their experience, CCEs make sure to mimic 
their language as part of the motivational inter-
viewing method, which prioritizes guiding students 
toward their own conclusions on their experiences. 
During each conversation, the CCE presents the 
array of resources on campus available to students 
who state they have experienced sexual miscon-
duct. If you’re looking for something like emotional 
counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy, SHARE 
may be the way to go. If you need to move rooms 
to distance yourself from your assailant, or even 
an ex, Title IX can help arrange accommodations. 
And if you want to hold your assailant accountable 
through disciplinary consequences, you can book 
a consultation with the UWC. But the process may 
be lengthy. 

As mandatory reporters, CCEs inform their 
OGCC supervisors of all disclosures, which are then 
reported to Title IX. Shirley then sends the survivor 
an email with resources and opportunities to fol-
low up with the office, which they may or may not 
respond to.

As they navigated their own process, being a 
CCE made K. feel “helped and not helped.” From 

“We have a tendency  to 
over-intellectualize our 
experiences in a way that 
can be challenging to give 
enough space for the human, 
personal elements of those 
experiences,” K. explained. 
“I have all this hefty consent-
based vocabulary that I can 
use in an academic context. 
But where does that leave 
space for my rage, and my 
pain, and my sadness?”

their own training, they recognized Shirley’s kind-
ness toward survivors of sexual violence. Still, K. felt 
strange about approaching someone related to their 
job. They remembered thinking, “Man, this is really 
fucking weird.”

K. also initially felt awkward telling their bosses 
about the assault—after all, they were a University 
employee, and the OGCC coordinators were the 
ones who signed their paychecks. They ultimately 
grew comfortable enough to be vulnerable with 
them after a CCE friend reassured them that the 
nature of their work is to understand situations 
like theirs. Their friends in the program supported 
them through their experience, often offering them 
a place to talk through their emotions while provid-
ing a shoulder to rest on.

“We have a tendency to over-intellectualize our 
experiences in a way that can be challenging to give 
enough space for the human, personal elements 
of those experiences,” K. explained. “I have all this 
hefty consent-based vocabulary that I can use in an 
academic context. But where does that leave space 
for my rage, and my pain, and my sadness?”

When students process their feelings about a 
sexual situation, CCEs take care not to use words like 
“rape,” “harrassment,” or “assault” if the person does 
not do so themselves. 

“If someone’s talking about a ‘really weird hook 
up,’ we just help them work through a ‘really weird 
hook up,’” Kanga explained to me. “We have the 
skills and the trainings to just be a validating and 
listening ear that I think really helps.”

Unlabeled incidents that are concerning to the 
CCEs—which CCE Maya Fonkeu ’25 called “events 
of concerns”—wouldn’t be officially reported to the 
OGCC or Title IX office, even if they’d be considered 
sexual misconduct based on Yale’s definitions. So, 
students would never get that email with support-
ive resources from Title IX, unless they labeled their 
experiences of misconduct on their own. 

Naina Agrawal-Hardin ’25, an Associate Editor 
of The New Journal, works with the national orga-
nization Know Your IX, which aims to end sexual 
and dating violence in schools through education 
on survivors’ rights through Title IX. Because the 
CCE program and SHARE are often successful at pro-
viding students individual attention and support, 
Agrawal-Hardin said, many people may decide 
against going to Title IX or other administrative 
bodies for accommodations. 

“On the one hand, it’s really excellent that 
students are able to circumvent these systems 
that often are traumatizing, are really lengthy, or 
really exhausting, or don’t always turn out in your 
favor,” she told me. “On another level . . . Yale has 
a lot more discretion about what numbers it dis-
closes, and how it represents the scale of the issue 
on campus.”

Since privacy concerns and confidentiality rules 
govern Title IX and the UWC, it’s difficult to know 
how many people who make disclosures to CCEs 
ultimately end up going to the Title IX office for a 
follow-up. Most CCEs I spoke to estimated that the 


majority of students who come to them do not con-
tinue onto Title IX, but stated that they couldn’t be 
completely sure. Shirley told me in her email that 
“many students who receive initial outreach from 
Title IX do follow up,” but declined to share more 
about numbers. Even if students decline to follow 
up with Title IX, the office’s official reports still 
include their disclosures. 

Outside sexual misconduct surveys might pro-
vide more clarity. In the spring of 2019, Yale partic-
ipated in the Association of American Universities’ 
Campus Climate Survey, which estimated that 38.7 
percent of the women and 15.4 percent of the men 
at Yale College experienced some kind of sexual 
assault. The 2018-2019 student body totaled 5,964, 
indicating that at least 1,600 students experienced 
sexual assault. But from fall 2015 to spring 2019, 
Title IX received only two hundred forty-six disclo-
sures of sexual assault, according to its semiannual 
reports on sexual misconduct cases.

Because Title IX is two semesters behind on 
releasing its reports, their most recent statistics on 
sexual misconduct at Yale date back to 2021. That 
year, there were a total of one hundred fifty-two 
disclosures of sexual harrassment, sexual assault, 
intimate partner violence, stalking, and other rec-
ognized forms of misconduct reported to Title IX, 
the UWC, and the Yale Police Department (YPD). 
Seventeen of these disclosures involved the YPD, 
while ten primarily involved the UWC. Of the eight 
resolved UWC cases, the UWC found sufficient evi-
dence of sexual misconduct in five. The outcome of 
those five resulted in  “respondent-focused responses” 
including written reprimands, sexual consent aware-
ness training, suspension, and expulsion. 

When K. was weighing their options, they reck-
oned with their general beliefs against the punitive 
UWC system and the raw pain they experienced fol-
lowing the assault. K. knew ostracizing perpetrators 
didn’t necessarily call for a “growth mindset.” They 
believe putting perpetrators through the punitive 
system, whether it’s the UWC or the carceral sys-
tem, can reproduce harm in the long run. But these 
beliefs didn’t change the fact that their assailant had 
harmed them, too. For a while, they struggled to 
reconcile their broader ideological beliefs on pun-
ishment with their personal feelings toward their 
assailant. 

“I felt like being a CCE seems so much more like 
the former to me, and being a person felt like the 
latter,” K. confessed. 

Although the CCE program and UWC were both 
created in 2011 in response to the public reckoning 
with sexual misconduct at Yale, the UWC representa-
tives only spoke directly to the CCEs this past semes-
ter. The experience was “exciting” to CCE Josephine 
Cureton ’24. 

“It definitely was not your typical CCE meeting 
at all,” she said. 

During the usual CCE training at the start of 
each semester, representatives from SHARE and 
Title IX directly speak to the CCEs, with explana-
tions of the UWC usually handled by the Title IX 


representatives. They also tended to give far less 
extensive information on the process. When I asked 
Cureton about what she learned, she whipped out 
a notebook and flipped through a list of the com-
plicated factors that go into the UWC’s investiga-
tion process: types of text and video evidence they 
accept, the amount needed to reject or move for-
ward with complaints, students’ ability to hire their 
own lawyers, policies on the cross-examination of 
witnesses, and more. 

The consultation with the UWC changed the 
way Cureton discusses paths forward with those 
who make disclosures. She wasn’t previously aware 
of much of the information presented, including 
the UWC’s “rigid” application of Yale’s definition of 
sexual misconduct to accept or reject complaints. 
In order for a complaint to move forward with the 
UWC, investigators need to believe there is above 
a fifty percent chance that the event actually hap-
pened. They can also choose to reject evidence—for 
example, if investigators feel that a text message 
doesn’t say enough, they can toss that piece of evi-
dence. Cureton never tells people they should go to 
any specific place, but the consultation confirmed to 
her that some institutional bodies are more likely to 
meet students’ immediate needs than others.

“I think normally if someone wants to go some-
where, SHARE is the place to go first because they 
are a lot better with guiding them with resources,” 
Cureton said. “I don’t think I can tell anyone in 
good conscience that the UWC is gonna solve all of 
your problems.”

Ultimately, healing for K. did not involve pur-
suing a response for their assailant through the UWC, 
but elsewhere. Meanwhile, they still wrestled with 
impostor syndrome when they reflected on their 
assault, often feeling torn between their identity as 
a CCE and their identity as a person. If anyone else 
had come to them as a CCE with a similar experi-
ence of sexual assault, K. told me in retrospect, they 
would have felt far more concerned about them 
than they did for themselves. They began to ques-
tion whether they were good at their job, especially 
as they tried to balance their personal feelings 
towards assault with the education they received 
during CCE meetings. 

Beyond their own experiences with sexual 
violence, CCEs’ special roles as both employees 
and students can put them in tricky or emo-
tionally taxing situations when disclosures are made 
by people they know—or about people they know. 

“Oftentimes there’s this feeling of ickiness,” 
Cureton told me, noting that her feelings usually 
depend on the specific situation. “It’s really hard to 
put into words.”

Magley, meanwhile, described situations where 
people he knew were perpetrators as “shocking, and 
scary, and sad, and disappointing.”

Because CCEs play a dual role of employee and 
student, their work status often impacts the ways 
they navigate friendships with other students. As 
soon as YCC President and CCE Julian Suh-Toma ’25

finished his CCE training, he informed his friends 
that he still wanted to be as intimate and support-
ive of a friend as possible, but that he was now a 
mandatory reporter on cases of misconduct. If they 
spoke about any such experiences in front of him, 
they could end up receiving an email from Shirley.

Receiving and reporting disclosures, though a 
clearly outlined aspect of CCEs’ responsibilities, can 
take a heavy emotional toll on students. YCC Vice 
President Fonkeu said she hadn’t initially imagined 
the range of duties and challenges the job would 
entail, including the impacts that receiving disclo-
sures would have on her own life. 

The distinction between the type of support 
CCEs are meant to give survivors and what they 
aren’t is murky, especially as CCEs themselves often 
go to OGCC staff to check-in on their wellbeing, talk 
through their feelings, and encourage them to seek 
professional emotional support resources.

“I’ve definitely leaned on OGCC a lot of times 
when those disclosures start to get heavy and sort 
of start to pervade into the other parts of my life,” 
Magley said. “The support that I got from staff 
members during various periods of more intense 
emotional labor from disclosures was really helpful.”

Elmileik wrote to me that CCEs may step back 
from the program if they feel doing so would be 
best for their wellbeing, and that it is possible for 
staff to assign them alternate office work if finances 
are a concern. K. confirmed this to me—although 
they did not step back from the program when they 
went through the Title IX process, Shirley men-
tioned taking a step back and performing alternate 
work as an option for them. 

It’s difficult to determine the number of sexual 
misconduct incidents that any CCE is told about, as 
defined by Yale policies. Because CCEs don’t impose 
their own definitions of what constitutes sexual 
misconduct onto students, they sometimes talk 
through the events of concern, which aren’t techni-
cally disclosures. In the past, Fonkeu has been trou-
bled enough by some of these instances that she’s 
gone directly to her OGCC bosses for help, receiving 
guidance in how to address the concerning dynam-
ics through follow-up conversations. 

Because CCEs must keep conversations with 
students confidential, I didn’t ask her what the 
outcomes of these follow-ups could entail, nor did 
I push the CCEs to give me information on how 
specific disclosures impacted their individual rela-
tionships. But the overall impacts of these conver-
sations lingered.

The number of disclosures Cureton receives 
fluctuates over a given period of time based on 
the social spaces she inhabits. Back when she was 
a member of a Greek life organization, she tended 
to get more disclosures than she does now. She 
emphasized the difficulty of navigating disclosures 
from people she knows personally, and that people 
tend to spring them on the CCEs at any time.

“Yes, you might be helping someone come 
to terms with and advance justice, and come to 
terms with something bad that happened to them,” 
Cureton said. “But it still feels really awful and dis-
heartening to hear some of these stories.”

Going through the Title IX process 
changed the way K. interacted with the sexual 
violence survivors who came to them for sup-
port. As a CCE, they began drawing clear distinctions 
about the expectations people should have coming 
into each support system, stressing that nothing 
is a one-stop shop and that survivors can choose 
the resources they receive depending on their spe-
cific needs. K.’s own path toward healing is of their 
own making—involving the no-contact agreement, 
cathartic conversations on friends’ common room 
floors, visits to Yale Mental Health and Counseling, 
and chats with their residential college dean.

In the beginning, K. viewed the work of a CCE 
as having a more one-off approach, pointing people 
to resources, maybe checking back in, but otherwise 
having finished their portion of the job. But, K. told 
me, their outlook on these conversations now signi-
fies “an ongoing relationship.” 

“[If a CCE-chat] does something for you, you’re 
not done yet, come back to me as a CCE,” K. said. 
“I’ll help you with step two.” 

Instead of listing off resources for sup-
port as “or’s,” K. began to list them off as “and’s.” 
Understanding this would have helped them tre-
mendously when they came into the Title IX office 
expecting to be emotionally healed.

CCEs, according to Elmileik, are supposed to be 
liaisons between student survivors and administra-
tive support systems—not primary point-people. 
But CCEs themselves spoke to different levels of 
engagement with students after initial disclosures. 
Some told me that due to the confidentiality rules 
governing the Title IX process, they usually let 
students go their way with little continued contact, 
leaving check-ins up to the survivors themselves. 
Others said that they continued to check in after 
the disclosure through their own initiative, whether 
it be through text updates about new resources or a 
coffee date where the assault is never even brought 
up.

Ultimately, the challenges CCEs face go beyond 
the already hefty responsibility of representing Yale 
and the program well. Toeing the line between 
employee and student comes with a set of expec-
tations from the students they serve, especially as 
organizations sometimes rely on them to ‘fix’ a toxic 
culture. But at the end of the day, CCEs are students 
who experience the social and sexual climate at Yale 
the same way the rest of us do. And no one’s an 
expert.

“Oftentimes, it’s easy to forget that we are stu-
dents like everyone else,” Magley told me. “And 
we go through similar things. And we struggle 
in similar ways as some of the people that we’re 
talking to.” ∎

together at the kitchen table of her 
apartment in downtown New Haven. 
On the table between us, an accordion 
folder bursts with the records of her 
activism: a laminated guide to forms of 
birth control, a flier for a queer cum-
bia dance party, a photocopied dia-
gram titled “aparato reproductor 
femenino útero”—female reproduc-
tive system uterus. A member of the 
Class of 2025, Allis is an Ethnicity, 
Race, and Migration major and a 
full-time healthcare coordinator at 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant 
Services (IRIS) in New Haven.

With a Google Doc full of 
questions and a half-eaten samosa, 
I nervously shuffle around and drop 
my claw clip on the floor, twice. It’s 
not every day that I ask one of my 
friends if I can turn a conversation 
we would usually have over dinner 
into a formal, on-the-record inter-
view. We decide to start with some-
thing familiar: the class we took 
together last semester.

One day in September, Allis 
walked out of the classroom half-
way through the seminar and didn’t 
return. I remember the flash of her 
yellow beanie disappearing through 
the doorway. When I ask her now 
why she left that day, she tells me 
about how tired she was. Allis was 
overwhelmed, struggling to see the 
point of continuing classes at Yale. 
“Going to school seemed unimport-
ant in the grand scheme of things 
because I was missing my family, my 
community, I was missing my dogs.” 
She missed home.

Home, for Allis, extends beyond 
Laredo, the rural town in South 
Texas where she grew up. When 
she thinks about home, she hears 
the chicharras, the dense whir of the 
cicadas’ song swelling through “the 
smell of wet earth after it rains on a 
hot summer day.” She hears clatters of 
laughter over the cumbia music drift-
ing between the stucco walls of her house 
on Mulberry Street in San Antonio. She 
hears the squeaking of her bike’s ungreased 
wheels as she rides her bike through 
Oakland. “There’s this James Baldwin 
quote . . . I can’t really remember,” she tells 
me. We find it later in her dog-eared copy 
of Giovanni’s Room: “Perhaps home is not 
a place but simply an irrevocable condition.”

For Allis, education is at the center 
remained hers alone. For Allis, the abil-
ity to retain the power of decision-mak-
ing in matters of reproductive healthcare 
defines reproductive justice. In 2013, she 
started advocating for her community in 
San Antonio, Texas. Her work as a doula, 
a community healer, focused on equip-
ping patients with the knowledge they 
need to ensure their consent to medical 
procedures is informed. 

Throughout the two-thousand tens, 
Allis’ activism led her to protests at the 
Texas State Capitol, to the front of 
makeshift classrooms where eager stu-
dents learned how to find their cervixes, 
to the bedside of patients seeking abor-
tions and, eventually, to a class called 
“Education and Empire” at Yale. That’s 
where I met Allis.

Around 11 p.m. one night in 
November 2000, 16-year-old Allis 
Ozornia felt a sharp pain in her 
abdomen. By 8 a.m. the next morning, 
half of her reproductive system had been 
surgically removed.

When Allis first mentioned the pain 
to her mom earlier that day, she 
wasn’t alarmed: “Oh mija, this is 
your period. You’re getting cramps.” 
After Allis fainted, they went to the 
hospital, where “almost everyone 
[she] interacted with” asked if she 
was pregnant. She knew how irrel-
evant the question of pregnancy was 
for her, and she tried to communi-
cate that to the doctors. “I came out 
shortly after my recovery . . . and I 
went full-force lesbian.” 

As her doctor approached her 
with a second pregnancy test and a 
raised eyebrow, Allis also knew that 
“something was wrong.” Looking 
back, Allis now understands that 
the doctor’s refusal to listen reduced 
her medical case to a stereotype 
of Latine people. “To him, I was 
just a pregnant border teen,” Allis 
says. “That was my first experi-
ence in not being heard by medical 
professionals.”

After her pregnancy tests came 
back negative, her doctor found a 
tumor on her right ovary and told 
her that he would perform an emer-
gency hysterectomy. “I was preco-
cious enough to understand that 
this meant that I wasn’t going to be 
able to have babies.” This is when 
the hocicona in Allis kicked in. Her 
mom’s nickname for her, hocicona, 
literally 
translates 
to 
“blabber-
mouth.” Allis explains, “I have opin-
ions and I say them.” Allis insisted 
that she wanted to have children, 
first explaining, then crying, then 
yelling, while her doctor stared 
blankly over his clipboard.

An hour or so later he returned 
with a new plan: they would remove 
only half of her reproductive system. He 
didn’t explain why the surgery was nec-
essary, what would be removed, or what 
steps Allis would need to take to heal. 
She woke up the next day with a “gash 
that ran from the top of [her] vaginal 
wall to [her] belly button.” 

Allis’ advocacy for herself that night 
in the emergency room ensured that the 
decision to have or not have children

2022, she was rejected.
According 
to 
Professor 
Talya 
“TZB” Zemach-Bersin, who teaches 
“Education and Empire” and lectures 
in the Education Studies department, 
there were around ninety applications to 
the class. On the Fall 2022 Canvas page 
for “Education and Empire,” prerequi-
sites were listed as “None (Preference for 
students who have already taken EDST 
110)”. Allis had spent a decade teaching 
health literacy, but had not taken EDST 
110, “Foundations in Education Studies,” 
and she had not expressed an interest in 
the Education Studies program in her 
application. A few hours before Add/
Drop period ended, Professor Zemach-
Bersin emailed her: there was an open 
spot. In the second week of the semester, 
she attended her first class.

“I’ll never forget on my first day TZB 
said heg– hag– ah, I can’t even pro-
nounce it now! Hegemony.” Allis raised 
her hand to ask what the word meant, 
Professor Zemach-Bersin explained, 
and the class moved on. It seemed like 
everyone else knew the word, respond-
ing quickly with thoughtful connec-
tions to the dense readings and other 
word salads. “I felt immediately that I 
wasn’t supposed to be in that space.”

After the first day, though, Allis kept 
coming to class, and eventually got off 
the waitlist. Every time she stood on 
Wall Street before class, marshaling the 
nerve to go inside, she reminded herself 
that she wanted to learn. And, she rea-
soned, wasn’t that why she came to Yale 
in the first place?

Well, part of the reason. In her 
health advocacy work, she noticed the 
power knowledge could hold. By the 
time Allis applied to San Antonio 
Community College (SAC) in 2018, Allis 
had worked as a doula for five years, see-
ing firsthand how information about 
birth control and obtaining safe abor-
tions could change her clients’ lives. The 
knowledge she learned and shared in 
her work as a doula, though, had not 
earned Allis a stable income. In higher 
education, she searched for the currency, 
intellectual and literal, that she needed 
to build a more financially stable life.

While Allis was studying biology 
at SAC, the word “teratoma” unboxed a 
memory. Allis finally grasped the sci-
ence behind what happened to her in 
2000—that her tumor, a teratoma, was 
born in her reproductive cells. There, the 
teratoma grew as it collected nearby tis-
sues into a dense mass. 
of the irrevocable condition she calls 
home. Through the ten years she spent 
organizing in the reproductive justice 
movement, she was a student and a 
teacher. She learned from fellow activ-
ists in late-night conversations and 
cross-legged knowledge-sharing circles. 
She taught her students reproductive 
health literacy in living rooms, massage 
studios, and abortion clinics. 
“This is how I started.” Allis gestures 
to a flier in the middle of the table that 
advertised what she considers her first 
foray into mutual aid work as a doula. 
Under the title, Hojas de Servicio, white 
flowers bloom on a black background. It 
reads: “Leaves of Service.” The services 
Allis offered included massages, consul-
tations on contraceptives, and tutorials to 
help her clients understand their anatomy. 
In exchange, she accepted any amount 
clients could afford to pay, or any item 
they could barter (on one occasion, three 
bottles of kombucha). Allis’ flier sum-
marizes her goal: to “make alternative 
therapies accessible to the San Antonio 
community who are unable to afford 
holistic health care.”


A
llis launched Hojas de Servicio 
in 2013 after the Texas State 
Legislature passed House Bill 2 (HB 2), 
expanding statewide restrictions on 
reproductive health care and abortion 
providers. The ratification unearthed 
Allis’ memories from that night in the 
emergency room. “I was reminded of 
what it felt like to have somebody else 
tell me what to do with my body,” Allis 
remembers.

The surgery left Allis with one less 
ovary and questions that still blink at her 
like hospital fluorescents through the 
darkness of her bedroom in the hours 
before she falls asleep. Why had his first 
thought been sterilization? Who were 
his other patients? 
She wonders, “What happened to 
the women who didn’t get a chance to 
speak up?” 

These are the questions that guided 
Allis’ work in the reproductive justice 
movement. After HB 2’s ratification, the 
number of women’s healthcare clinics 
that offered abortions reduced by half 
in the span of three years, and patients 
who couldn’t afford healthcare or find 
a clinic near them sought alternatives. 
Through her work on Hojas de Servicio, 
Allis offered an alternative in the 
form of conversations and pamphlets 
exchanged between friends with a con-
crete, practical goal: expanding access 
to informed health care. Knowledge, in 
Allis’ view, was something to share.

At Yale, the knowledge that Allis 
had cherished in her work as an activist 
took a distorted form. It was compressed 
into 250-word Canvas discussion posts 
and castle-side classrooms. Allis found 
that Yalies trade knowledge, too, but 
as currency: a well-written paper in 
exchange for an A, an oozing email 
in exchange for acceptance to a class.

“[Ser] was the first academic that 
I didn’t feel that with,” Allis explains. 
They were a radical activist who orga-
nized against institutional structures of 
oppression, and they were a sharp crit-
ical thinker who leveraged institutional 
power to achieve their goals.

Allis remembers staying up late with 
Ser, “talking feministy stuff.” While they 
were talking about Ser’s research on ster-
ilization, a question that had lingered in 
Allis’ mind since the night of her surgery 
resurfaced. If it was possible to save half 
her reproductive system in the end, why 
had sterilization been her doctor’s first 
course of action?

Through her conversations with Ser, 
Allis learned about the romance between 
eugenics and reproductive healthcare for 
Latine patients in America. She learned 
about the widespread sterilization of 
Puerto Rican women throughout the 
twentieth century by doctors who adver-
tised la operación as the only available 
birth control. She learned about the 
“twenty thousand patients recommended 
for sterilization between 1919 and 1953” 
in California, patients who were dispro-
portionately Latine. She learned about 
how the funding Margeret Sanger and 
Planned Parenthood provided for the 
Gathering this information cleared 
the shame and confusion that had 
obscured her memories of the surgery. 
“It was a relief for me.” Beyond relief, 
Allis began to feel she had control over 
her understanding of the surgery. At 
SAC, Allis realized the knowledge that 
she learned in a higher education space 
could make her feel powerful. 

Encouraged by her experience at 
SAC, Allis applied to four-year colleges in 
Texas, wanting to stay close to home. Her 
top choice was the University of Texas 
at Austin. But she knew she couldn’t 
afford to pay for tuition, so she Googled 
“undergrad for nontraditional students 
big endowment,” and the Eli Whitney 
program popped up. 

It was the first time Allis had 
thought about Yale since the nineties, 
when she watched Jessica’s meltdown 
after the Ivy League rejected her in the 
sitcom Saved by the Bell. When Yale 
accepted Allis with an offer that would 
cover her tuition and rent, she figured, 
why not? “I was tired of being broke.”

A year into her time at Yale, Allis 
felt far away from home and far away 
from the power in knowledge she 
found at SAC. She was battling new 
questions: Why did she come to Yale, 
and why should she stay here?

These are the questions we mull over 
while we sit across from each other in Allis’ 
apartment. The awkwardness of our inter-
view subsides, and we talk about how Allis’ 
years of reproductive justice work connect 
to her life as an Eli Whitney student.

After HB 2 passed in 2013, Allis didn’t 
launch Hojas de Servicio right away. The 
shape her activism would take was not 
clear to Allis until she got a call from her 
friend and reproductive justice activist, 
Serpentina. Allis met Ser when she was 
living in California in 2010. Across the 
dance floor at a West Oakland music fes-
tival, Allis saw “this beautiful statuesque 
person.” Ser stands over six feet, Allis adds, 
raising her hands over her head to demon-
strate: “like, tall.” 
“I went up to them and just started 
dancing with them, and that was the 
beginning of our friendship,” Allis 
says. At the time, Allis was training in 
massage therapy, and Ser was work-
ing on their undergraduate thesis at 
the University of California, Berkeley: 
“Forced Sterilizations in Peru during 
the Fujimori Dictatorship.” 
Before 
Allis 
met 
Ser, 
she 
approached college students with 
some suspicion. “All throughout my 
twenties,” Allis remembers, “I was 
the person basically telling people 
that college wasn’t needed to measure 
someone’s intellect.” She perceived a 
divide between radicals, who learned 
from their communities, and academ-
ics, who learned from a bank of pre-
scriptive knowledge.

At Yale, the knowledge that 
Allis had cherished in her 
work as an activist took 
a distorted form. It was 
compressed into 250-word 
Canvas discussion posts 
and castle-side classrooms. 
Allis found that Yalies 
trade knowledge, too, but 
as currency: a well-written 
paper in exchange for an A, an 
oozing email in exchange for 
acceptance to a class.

didn’t transfer to the American medical 
system, Awa enrolled at Georgia State 
to study biology. When she noticed a 
message from the Eli Whitney program 
in her inbox, she thought it was a spam 
email. Like Allis, she only knew Yale 
from American TV dramas where hot, 
rich teenagers agonize over acceptances.

Bonding over their commitment to 
healthcare and their confusion about 
their sudden transformation into Yalies, 
Allis and Awa became close friends. 
When Allis is thinking about something 
she learned in class, when she needs 
someone to give her a ride, when she 
needs a sounding board for her frustra-
tions about Yale, she calls Awa. “Awa has 
been everything for me.”

Allis remembers how Ser captured 
that “everything” feeling too. More 
than an academic, Ser was “a punk, an 
artist, a radical thinker, and [a] critic,” 
and they were the friend Allis turned to 
when she felt frustrated and confused 
after HB 2 was passed.

In July 2013, Ser called Allis with 
an idea: would Allis help them host a 
knowledge share? By then, Allis had 
moved to San Antonio, and Ser flew 
down from the West Coast to join her. 
Puerto Rican pill trials in the nine-
teen-fifties and the history of feminists 
who dismissed Latine patients’ agency, 
minimizing the experiences of those 
who willingly chose sterilization.

Through the lens of her new knowl-
edge, Allis was able to view her brush 
with sterilization in context of this col-
lective history. With Ser, Allis pieced 
through these accounts, the current state 
of sterilizations in the U.S., and the ques-
tions that these realities raise about race, 
gender, and bodily autonomy until the 
sun turned the Oakland skyline shades 
of orange. 

Allis hoped that, at Yale, she would 
continue the critical conversations that 
she had started with Ser in Oakland, but 
her suspicion toward academia hadn’t 
subsided. Academia was central to the 
structures of power that Allis aimed to 
disrupt through her healthcare advo-
cacy. Yale, she knows, is deeply rooted 
in these power structures. The American 
Eugenics Society was headquartered at 
Yale from 1926 to 1938, and supported 
legislation that permitted involuntary 
sterilizations while Yale-educated doc-
tors put law into practice. Allis strug-
gled to see how she would learn at an 
institution that had endowed students 
with knowledge they leveraged to harm 
the communities she had advocated to 
protect.

 The disconnect that Allis perceived 
between the Eli Whitney program and her 
“matriarchal, queer, activist, artist” commu-
nity from Texas deepened her hesitations. 
She remembers that the first event, a din-
ner for accepted Eli students, “felt very 
cis male, hetero, military—just the total 
opposite of the world I was coming from.”

At that dinner, Allis met Awa, an 
Eli Whitney student studying Molecular, 
Developmental, and Cellular Biology. 
Awa remembers Allis’ “very bubbly,” 
enthusiastic voice responding, “wow, 
like water?” when Awa introduced her-
self. Reflecting on that moment, Allis 
thinks it’s fitting that Awa’s name trans-
lates to water “because she has been like 
water for me in this experience [at Yale]. 
She’s been necessary, and I’m so grateful 
for her and to her.” 

Awa resonated with Allis’ experi-
ence of coming to Yale with knowledge 
that did not fit a Western standard. Awa 
had worked as a nurse in Senegal for 
five years before she immigrated to the 
U.S. in 2018. Finding that her credentials

see how much power can be shared in 
a non-academic way.”
By the time Allis came to Yale, she 
knew how powerful knowledge could 
be outside an academic space from her 
healthcare advocacy as a doula, and she 
had a sense of how powerful knowledge 
could be within academia from her 
experience at SAC. In “Education and 
Empire,” Allis didn’t find that power 
again until she read A Third University 
is Possible by la paperson in late October 
last semester.­­

I ask Allis about the book while 
we sit outside of the Beinecke, a week 
after our first interview in her apart-
ment. She takes it out of her backpack. 
Its exterior is unimposing, a bright 
blue cover holding a thin seventy pages, 
hardly bigger than my hand. The inte-
rior, though, is a dense work of schol-
arship full of obscure allusions to film 
theory and sentences like “we have the 
pitfall of anthropocentrism.” It is the 
kind of book that Allis would have 
once dismissed as stuffy philosophy, far 
removed from the practical knowledge 
that she considered empowering.

One quote in Allis’ copy is under-
lined deeply enough to indent the page: 
“The university is an assemblage. It is 
a giant machine composed of myriad 
working parts, multiple systems. Each 
part can still be thought of as a dis-
crete organism to be unplugged and 
replugged somewhere else.” In the mar-
gin, Allis noted, “Thinking of myself as 
part of an assemblage . . . helps ease the 
mounting pressure of success that this 
place perpetuates.”

She explains her note to me: “I 
think ultimately the first weeks I was in 
TZB’s class . . . I felt confused because up 
“I wanted people to 
know what’s going on 
in their bodies before 
they let anyone else 
handle their insides.”
until that point I had interpreted suc-
cess in this place on what we see like 
on the pamphlets and what we see at 
orientations, becoming the next Ian 
Shapiro.” When she read the book, the 
knowledge Allis understood from her 
life as an activist and the knowledge she 
learned at Yale clicked into alignment. 
“Thinking of myself as just this piece 
of an assemblage where I can plug and 
plug whenever I want gave me so much 
agency.” The pressure Allis felt to fit 
what she perceived as the Yale version 
of success lifted. “[The book] kind of 
gave me my power back.” For Allis, this 
power resides in her ability to retool the 
knowledge she absorbs from texts like 
A Third University is Possible and classes 
like “Education and Empire” to suit 
the version of success she strives for in 
her advocacy. 

Now, Allis’ successes branch through 
New Haven. At IRIS, Allis works 
with the Services for Undocumented 
Neighbors team to help immigrants 
who are new to New Haven navigate 
the healthcare system. At an academic 
forum in April, Allis read an intro-
duction for Awa before she presented 
her biomedical research on malaria. At 
Professor Zemach-Bersin’s house, Allis 
throws a ball for TZB’s frenetic Boston 
terrier, Frankie, while they catch up on 
life and work.

Allis and I became friends after she 
read A Third University is Possible, when 
she reached out to me to ask if I wanted 
to get a coffee. It was early November, 
and we sat outside of the Blue State 
behind the business school with our 
laptops between us, chatting and work-
shopping ideas for an upcoming paper. 
By the time we finished talking, Blue 
State was closed and we were both 
significantly puffier, having layered on 
hats and sweaters when the setting sun 
dragged the temperature down with it. 

As we sit outside of the Beinecke 
five months later, a breeze lifts the war-
bles of returning birds over the rumble 
of traffic from York Street. Behind us, 
the Schwarzman Center announces 
itself in an incontrovertible wall of stone, 
but we are too busy to notice, laughing 
over the story I tell Allis about my first 
pap smear.

It’s one of the first days of spring, 
and the leaves are budding.∎
Grace Ellis is a sophomore in 
Benjamin Franklin College.

They started planning “Know Yo Self,” a 
day-long workshop where Allis and Ser 
taught participants skills for reproduc-
tive health literacy, ranging from mas-
sage techniques to information about 
menstruation. 

Of the roughly twenty people who 
participated in “Know Yo Self,” some 
were full-time community organizers 
while others worked at reproductive 
healthcare clinics. Some had children 
while others had no interest in becom-
ing parents. Allis describes the commu-
nity she built around “Know Yo Self ” 
as “tight-knit,” knotted together at the 
heart of San Antonio by their queer-
ness, and their commitment to making 
reproductive healthcare accessible. 

The group of attendees gathered for 
“Know Yo Self ’s” main activity: a lesson 
in how to use a speculum to perform a 
self-exam of their cervixes—the mus-
cular tissue that connects the uterus to 
the vagina. Some gynecologists advise 
against checking your cervix, since it can 
be difficult to understand how the tis-
sue should feel, and doctors will usually 
perform the exam during regular visits. 
But for communities that can’t access 
consistent health care, Allis emphasizes 
the important gap in knowledge that 
self-exams can fill. “When you can’t 
afford to go to the gynecologist,” she 
explains, people “learn to do things their 
own way . . . People are going to stick 
things in their vagina. People are going 
to have abortions.” 

Allis emphasizes that there can be a 
risk in a self-driven approach to health-
care if your speculum isn’t sanitized or 
you don’t understand your anatomy: 
“That’s why education is so important.” 
By teaching workshop participants how 
to examine themselves safely, Allis and 
Ser offered them practical reproductive 
health knowledge—the ability to know 
how their body usually looks and feels, 
so that when something doesn’t feel 
right, they can seek help.

At “Know Yo Self,” Allis saw her 
cervix for the first time, and she cried. 
“I cried because I was seeing a part of 
my system that was handled many 
years before by strangers.” In that 
moment, Allis’ desire to help members 
of her community advocate for them-
selves crystallized. “I wanted people 
to know what’s going on in their bod-
ies before they let anyone else han-
dle their insides.” The workshop was 
a turning point for Allis. “It ignited 
something in me that allowed me to

and bled, turning the whole pancake sick.
I tossed it, tried again, facing the window
With an egg-blue frame that revealed
The sea silently breaking and the boys
Tossing a navy object, squirming in the air like a fish.
I called them boys though we were the same
age. In the private sphere I was a woman;
In public, a girl. Meaning I was
Both trusted and instructed to make breakfast.
I held the bowl with both hands
And poured the dough into the pan.
Blue floor, blue fan, blue air around the blue
Walls with the blue lesion showing
The blue sea and sky—the entire room
Covered in expectations for me
Like the light of radiation whose hue
Eclipses everything, even its own name.

After “Giverny” by Ian Pople
Summer pollen settled
on the taupe plywood fence you leaned over
to pet the neighbors’ full-grown
pig, its belly dragging the ground in the yard
covered with rusted toys and inflatable pools. You stained your 
best white swimsuit.
Then, through the pale pink
and green of the pier, we saw the umbrellas
in yellow stripes and the rainbow candyfloss ones, all in front of 
the mural
of a woman looking at the ocean 
through a telescope, the sides
of the telescope painted grey 
and flat because
the glass, the reflection, the clarity,
was complicated, and so the patch was painted
over and repainted several times, to perfect 
the mistake, and so the woman was looking
at nothing at all, except her own face— round 
like a full moon over the Gulf,
but mostly blank. You declared the mural
super, remarkable, then sprinted into the Atlantic,
grinning as you showed me a discarded styrofoam cup you 
found in the waves, as if it was (?) a trophy.
I feel like this is an important detail.
That night we ate linguini on the porch
during a summer thunderstorm, and you were laughing while 
branches were falling
in the backyard, covering moss green spots 
with grey flashes, and I was looking at you
as if I was peering through that woman’s 
telescope, a telescope warped
by the girls who had held it, who had sung of its sight, who had 
sung of brief love in the summer.

I 
did not see the iwi kūpuna1, but 
their presence hollowed my bones. 
Beside me in the cramped backseat 
of a minivan, beneath the exhausted light 
of a New England autumn afternoon, 
beneath layers of carefully wrapped black 
cloth, beneath a box, lie the mandibles 
and teeth of unnumbered, unidentified 
kanaka maoli2. The gray sky framed by 
the car window becomes my imaginative 
canvas for the iwi; the cultural protocol 
of traditional Native Hawaiian repatri-
ation prohibits wahine3 from any direct 
interface with them. Josh, who is able to 
handle the iwi, describes them to me as 
cold, stripped of humanity by the scien-
tific method, displaced for the sake of 
museum archival preservation. I consider 
it a blessing that cultural protocol shields 
me from seeing this forced displacement 
from all axes of existence, though I per-
sist to imagine their vitality.

On October 4, 2022, Hi‘ilei Hobart, 
Assistant 
Professor 
of 
Native 
and 
Indigenous Studies,  participated along-
side undergraduates Kala‘i Anderson 
’25, Joshua Ching ’26, and I in a Native 
Hawaiian ceremonial repatriation of 
iwi kūpuna housed in the Yale Peabody 
Museum since the eighteen-seventies. 
We could not have completed this repa-
triation without the passage of the 
Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, 
which, by U.S. federal law, mandates 
“the return of human remains, funerary 
objects, sacred objects, and objects of 
patrimony to lineal descendants, Native 
American tribes, Alaskan Natives, and 
Native Hawaiian organizations.” In 2014, 
the Peabody intended to repatriate these 
specific iwi to Hawai‘i; however, they were 
unknowingly separated from their larger 
shipment and remained in museum stor-
age. Eight years later, Professor Hobart 
found the iwi during a Peabody tour and, 
decisively, held the museum account-
able to initiate another repatriation.

October’s repatriation comes from 
a lineage of contemporary Native 
Hawaiian repatriation work that aims to 
heal the wounds of a violent colonial past. 
In their essay “Ka Huaka‘i O Nā ‘Ōiwi: 
The Journey Home”, Native Hawaiian 
repatriation scholars Edward Halealoha 
Ayau and Ty Kāwika Tengan write that 
colonialism has alienated kanaka maoli 
from their lands, histories, and gods. At 
the epicenter of this alienation is the 
desecration of gravesites, through which 
iwi are collected. Ayau and Tengan out-
line common justifications for the col-
lection of iwi kūpuna: use in eugenic 
studies and anthropological studies of a 
“disappearing race,” sales to collectors or 
educational institutions, and removal as 
a consequence of urbanization. Preceded 
by the repatriation work of contempo-
rary Native Hawaiian leaders, October’s 
repatriation is indebted to the strength 
and perseverance of all the kanaka maoli 
who have repatriated before us.

Although the seed of a lineage, this 
repatriation was the first at Yale to be led 
by the kanaka maoli of the University’s 
community. The increase in kanaka 
maoli involvement during this repatria-
tion compared to those past is not only 
reflective of Professor Hobart’s leader-
ship, but also of the unprecedented num-
ber of kanaka maoli now at Yale. The four 
of us kanaka maoli met daily to learn 
lyrics, practice reciting our mo‘okū‘au-
hau4 for as many generations back as 
we knew, refine intonation and pronun-
ciation, and most importantly, harness 
our voice. Preceded by a dense week of 
cultural programming—including the 
memorization of anchor pule5 and oli6 
that totaled over eighty lyrical lines of

‘ōlelo7—the completion of October’s 
repatriation is indebted to the teachings 
of cultural practitioners Mana Caceres, 
Kalehua Caceres, and Halealoha Ayau.

It is the day before repatriation, 
and I am the only customer in Atticus 
Bookstore Cafe. I trade out my anno-
tated copy of Aeschylus’ Oresteia for the 
twelve pages of repatriation cultural pro-
tocol that I need to have pa‘a8 in a matter 
of hours. Though a plurality of identity is 
stitched into my seams, it threads the dis-
tance within myself. Every line of Greek 
tragedy I read spins a web between New 
Haven and Hawai‘i, and every missed 
diacritical and mispronounced word in 
‘ōlelo Hawai‘i bares my entanglement. 
I mouth Pule Ikaika—the first prayer 
of the ceremony, which asks for the 
strength of our ancestors to support the 
work of repatriation—in a hushed voice, 
like a secret. E ho‘ōla iā mākou i nā mea 
Hawai‘i kūpono / E ho‘āla iā mākou i ka 
na‘au pono no kēia hana / E ho‘ohui iā 
mākou i ho‘okahi mana‘o. Grant life to 
us in the true Hawaiian sense / Awaken 
within us the true depth of this work / 
Allow us to become one in mind.

The irony is not lost on me. Plurality 
is self-canceling. Plurality is paradoxi-
cally alienating.

I am silent, but returning to my cor-
roded mother tongue provokes sobs that 
can be heard from Hawai‘i. I am the 
words I don’t speak. I am the memories 
of home I don’t remember. I am the log-
ical gaps of my freshman year philosophy, 
yearning for a satiating ontological proof 
in a college whose history is antithetical 
to my own existence. I am the negative 
space of my lineage, lost somewhere 
between my future and past.

The morning of the ceremony, I 
dress in all black. Josh and I eat break-
fast together in silence. We meet Kala‘i 
and Professor Hobart. There is not much 
said between us kanaka maoli, but I 
know we are together. The outside is 
bright, and the inside is dark. We enter 
the room at the Peabody West Campus 
where the iwi are housed. All the lights 
are off. The day is young, and the room is 
ageless. Kala‘i immediately flicks pī kai9 
containing ‘olena1⁰ sea salt from Hawai‘i 
onto us and all. Drops of home trickle 
down my forehead. We begin. Kala‘i and 
Josh together cut the cloth that will be 
wrapped around the iwi to keep them in 
Pō11. We recite the oli and anchor pule. 
We recite our individual mo‘okū‘au-
hau to tell the iwi kūpuna whom we 
come from. Josh and Kala‘i take inven-
tory of the iwi kūpuna, and there is an 
error. Inconsistent labeling. But because 
we are all together, we are calm and we 
continue. Kala‘i and Josh together clarify 
the error with the Peabody staff. They, 
together, wrap the iwi. Kala‘i flicks pī kai 
again onto us and all that surrounds us to 
cleanse the space. We leave together as 
one, iwi in hand.

From New Haven, we drive to 
Poughkeepsie, New York, inbound to 
Vassar College. There, we will perform 
the repatriation ceremony again with 
Halealoha Ayau and another kanaka 
maoli student, so they can return the 
iwi back to Hawai‘i. In the backseat of 
the van, I try to imagine the iwi kūpuna. 
Restless in a small city called New 
Haven, an ocean away from home, they 
were here centuries before I could even 
fathom my existence in the Northeast. 
Their remains are also in Vassar College. 
And in Harvard University, Dartmouth 
College, the Smithsonian Museum, 
and more institutions spanning conti-
nents. It is only my sixth week at Yale 
University, and the iwi kūpuna, a devas-
tating testament to my institution’s colo-
nial history, are tightly strapped in a seat 
belt next to me.

And for the rest of fall semester, I 
struggle to commit to that world. The 
tragedy that repatriation was predicated 
upon permeates my consciousness, alien-
ating me from academic work at Yale. 
Reading the Western canon has become 
a dispossession of identity, but on a 
rare November afternoon, I read Ovid’s 
Metamorphoses on a bench overlook-
ing Science Hill until I can no longer 
see the pages. Mortal Hyacinthus dies 
to Apollo’s discus like a broken flower, 
his head snapped down so he faces the 
earth—it is through the nature of his 
death that the namesake flower emerges. 
A name immortalizes death, what’s more, 
a story: Ovid writes, “a valiant hero shall 
be known by the same marks upon its 
petals.” In complete darkness, my feet 
crunch the dead leaves below. The great 
are buried, and their afterlife of great-
ness buries what’s native. Here in New 
Haven, all of my heroes are fading, and 
I do not know how to forgive myself for 
my complicity.

In my literature seminar the fol-
lowing morning, Assistant Professor 
of Classics Erika Valdivieso explains 
how burials in the epic tradition mark 
privilege. The burial of Hyacinthus, like 
many others in Virgil’s Aeneid, memo-
rializes male heroes in place. Even the 
exceptional female warrior Camila in the 
Aeneid is bereft of this memorialization 
in place. Professor Valdivieso cites an 
article by Dr. Georgia Nugent entitled 
“The Women of the Aeneid–Vanishing 
Bodies, Disappearing Voices” and points, 
“Where do the bodies of women go?” 
This is a question that exists beyond epic 
myth, an unresolved reality for which 
marginalized communities demand an 
answer from the world.


Instead of our usual fall semester 
morning seminars, it is a spring after-
noon—a new sunlight is upon us in 
the Humanities Quadrangle courtyard. 
Professor Valdivieso and I discuss ways 
to read the epic tradition resistantly, an 
empowering mode of literary reception 
that her academic career in the classics 
and colonial early Americas has inspired 
me to uphold. A text’s longevity doesn’t 
come from language, but rather its recep-
tion: “close reading allows you to see the 
sutures, the slips, the bumps, in the fabric 
of texts,” she tells me, “ . . . you as a reader, 
work to unstitch the ideological proj-
ects of texts.” Reinterpretation brightens 
what greatness has shadowed—even in 
the dark, one can still imagine. 
For what is absence if not a search for 
relationality, loss if not a presence of duty?

The vanishing bodies of women in 
the Roman epic remind me of the rea-
sons for repatriation—to unstitch and 
restitch the narratives of marginalized 
communities that history has failed in 
doing––and I hear Pule Nā Kūpuna12 
echoing back. Na mākou e mālama i nā 
iwi o ko mākou kūpuna / Na nā mo‘o e 
mālama i ko mākou iwi / A ho‘omau ka 
lōkahi o kākou no laila / E hō mai ka‘ike. 
We will protect the bones of our ancestors 
/ And our children will protect our bones / 
As we continue this interdependency, thus / 
Grant us knowledge. Unlike close reading, 
however, unstitching history is predicated 
upon community. Restitching his-
tory is predicated upon a generation.

For who are kanaka maoli today, 
if not a rope of lineage, realizing our 
future together is intertwined with our 
predecessors?

Interdependency is a continuum, 
and it is this powerful Indigenous rela-
tionality that heals. It has sustained my 
vitality at Yale and has been my proof 
of existence. In the parking lot of the 
Peabody Museum’s West Campus, Kala‘i 
ties my kīhei13 tightly before the repa-
triation ceremony. At the end of the 
ceremony, the six of us kanaka maoli 
share two bowls of fresh ‘ahi1⁴ and rice 
on the floors of Vassar College in relief. 
A month later, Josh and I race to the 
shore at Lighthouse Point Park, our bare, 
shriveled palms touching sand for the 
first time since leaving Hawai‘i. Another 
month later, he strums my ‘ukulele in my 
suite, and we sing into the winter night 
until it no longer tastes bitter. When 
New Haven freezes over at the start of 
February, Professor Hobart hosts Pacific 
Islander students in her apartment, and 
together, we eat her homemade saimin 
on a roundtable. In this transitory period 
that is college, I measure my life in these 
beautiful moments of interdependence, 
because they point homeward.

For myself and other kanaka maoli 
at Yale, this recognition of interdepen-
dency as essential to ourselves began 
with repatriation. Six months after the 
repatriation ceremony, Josh and I are 
alone in the Stiles Buttery on an April 
night. We ruminate here often together. 
“Repatriation,” he says, “in a very sur-
face level sense, is the definition itself 
of giving and helping out without any 
expectation of receiving because there 
is no physical way to receive something 
when it is returning the dead.” Though 
now relieved from repatriation’s distress, 
recovering these memories is cathartic, 
and he believes it will always be. 
“Despite being a culture and a peo-
ple who have experienced so much loss, 
losing those relations to each other 
through all of the history Hawaiians 
have had to endure, it is that ground-
ing in our responsibilities to each other 
that have kept us going,” Josh tells me. 
Repatriation has blessed me with a 
beloved friend whose soul is native soil, 
and whose voice replenishes it.

And I am most replenished in the 
presence of my Native heroes. In an 
academic panel hosted by New York 
University’s Asian Pacific American 
Institute that I attended during spring 
break, Dr. Mary Tuti Baker prefaced her 
segment by asking the audience to tell 
their neighbor whose spirit they have 
brought with them to the panel. I tell the 
unfamiliar NYU student next to me that 
the spirit of my deceased great-grand-
mother Leina‘ala Poepoe is with me, the 
oldest relative in my mo‘okū‘auhau with 
koko Hawai‘i1⁵ I knew and will ever 
know in my lifetime.

She 
has 
followed 
me 
across 
Moananuiākea1⁶, across state lines, and 
subway lines she had never crossed. Her 
spirit was with me during the repatria-
tion ceremony, in the car ride watching 
over my shoulders as the iwi kūpuna are 
beside me, finally in Pō. When I was 
three years old, she held my hand as we 
walked through her garden on the lush 
mountains of Puna, Hawai‘i. Fifteen 
years later, I reach out for her palms in 
the withering autumn. I do not know 
what the iwi kūpuna look like, but she 
eases my imagination.

Despite my authorial attempts, any 
image of the iwi kūpuna is four times 
removed—once by colonial disposses-
sion; twice by the osteological work of 
the Yale Peabody Museum that sterilized 
and shelved the iwi away from history; 
a third time by the dialogue between 
Professor Hobart, Josh, and Kala‘i, who 
all saw or handled the plasticized iwi, 
and myself who had not; and a fourth 
by my own language in this piece to 
you, the reader. In spite of—or precisely 
because of—this chasm that separates 
our existence from our history, there is a 
demand for us to imagine.

Through imagining my iwi kūpuna, 
my way of knowing is no longer linear, 
but circular.

My backbone is no longer rigid, 
but spiral. My selfhood is no longer a 
stitched thread, but a woven rope. And 
the ending is no longer a burial, but 
a revival. ∎

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The first time I came home after being gone, I felt 
as if I was meeting myself for the first time. The apartment 
was the same—cluttered, askew, and dense with the scent of 
bodies being bodies.


My father glanced up from his desk when he heard the 
door open.
“You’re back,” he remarked. “We’re eating at 7.”
I used to believe that my home was hiding things from 
me. I had strange dreams about secret rooms tucked behind 
racks of clothing in my parents’ closet and treasure hidden in 
the folds of winter blankets. 
“Are you looking for something?” my mother asked when 
she noticed me trying to dislodge a drawer sealed shut with 
old paint and humidity. 
“I just wanted to see what was in there.”
“I think it’s empty. It’s been stuck for as long as I can 
remember.” 
My parents were wary of leaving me alone as a child. I 
was sure that a bookshelf would fall on me or my popcorn 
would catch fire in the microwave, and I had a bad feeling 
about the man who lived on the 14th floor. At eleven, when 
I had long outgrown a babysitter, I went exploring in earnest. 
Alone, I found a dusty key at the bottom of a bowl of oranges 
and several paperback books of poetry in my father’s sock 
drawer. The inscriptions on the first pages read To David and 
To David, again. But I already knew that my father’s first 
wife was a poet, and none of our locks yielded themselves 
to the key. In the closet, I burrowed into the musky folds 
of old coats with my arms outstretched, but all I found was 
a chalky wall that left white residue on my fingertips—no 
hidden rooms. Eventually, I gave up looking and tried on 
my mother’s nightgowns and undergarments. I imagined a 
time when I too would smell powdery and dress like I had 
something to hide. 

As I spent more time alone, I lost interest in finding 
something hidden. When I finally left, I worried that I had 
left something behind. 

Now that I was back, I felt a new heaviness in the air. 
The wooden doorframes had warped so the only way to shut 
doors was to slam them, and a spot of rust on the refrigerator 
had spread like a rash. The dogs twitched nervously when my 
mother clanked down the hallway on her new crutches. She 
had broken her leg falling in the snow.
“A glass dining table represents an unstable family,” she 
declared at dinner.
I carved a circle in the cloudy grime on our table’s glass 
surface, which was scarcely visible under piles of outdated papers.
“I thought you might want to read them,” my father said, 
as if the news did not reach me where I had been.

When my parents left for work the next day, I felt 
the familiar desire to discover something buried. The 
bookshelf seemed like a dull place to hunt for secrets, but 
a leatherbound volume on the bottom shelf caught my 
attention. Surely I had seen it before, but it must have seemed 
so uninteresting that it did not even register in my memory. 
The book was heavier than I expected. On the first page were 
pasted photographs of young people at a party, grinning and 
strewn about in the manner of those who know they are 
beautiful. The paint on the walls behind them was flaking 
off in long, mournful strips and beer cans stood precariously 
on leaning towers of books. As I flipped the page, I noticed 
how the threshold of the kitchen jutted out just so—it was 
undeniably our apartment. And the posture of the woman in 
the back corner of the photograph was undeniably that of my 
mother.
In the following pages, I watched her pose at the top of a 
mountain and kiss men I had never seen before. I noticed the 
way her cheeks pushed up past her eyes and her nose sunk 
below her top lip when she smiled. I hated these features of 
my own face, but on this stranger, they were charming. Most 
of the pictures were taken in our apartment, where the only 
recognizable features were the moldings and electrical outlets. 
Disheveled men leaned against walls now covered in my 
baby pictures.
I always knew, in a vague sort of way, that my mother 
had lived here long before I came around, but I had not 
considered the weight of accretion. The very floor and walls—
my floor and my walls—were the site of her parties and 
bygone friends, the ones she sometimes talked about as if she 
had been alive forever.

It’s March again
I keep my window open when I’m afraid to go outside. 
But the weather’s been good—warm and honest, in that when 
one day is seventy degrees, the next few are too. And I like this, 
the idea of going out, knowing what to expect, and getting 
what I want.
I have also been dishonest. Dishonest, in that I believe 
I will want to go outside and feel the first breeze of the year 
and see everybody I know. I’ll step out of my dorm and open 
its big iron gate with the full lean of my all body weight. The 
sounds of College Street traffic will truck me, roaring muffler-
removed beater cars, horns, motorbikes, sirens, and some 
pounding, bass-boosted song I remember from online. 
I will walk to Cross Campus, because everybody I know 
would too. And it will be just as I imagine: everybody I know, all 
at once. I sit with this part the longest. I keep my window open.

St. Paul, Minnesota
Returning from a walk, we reach our house and see the light 
burst a hole through the living 
room window, sidewalks and roads glazed with ice,
mailboxes tight-lipped. 
I look up at mother, watch the snow 
rest on her eyelashes.
Around us, the snowblowers and snowplow-trucks begin 
once more, another morning. 
My father’s part of the crew as well.
In the distance, a train just visible above the treetops.
The women enter the house, 
stay there. Wanting to help my father, I go in, 
change into snowpants, then run back outside, 
hop toward my shovel, 
which is leaning against empty pots and the gutter.
It has a plastic red blade, like a matchstick—
In this scene, like others
to come, I am a child up to no good. 
See for yourself: how I grab the shiny handle, 
how unevenly the yard ignites.

The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in history when people 
are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was presumably considered new. Wishing to 
share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. Besides, things seemed slow around here.”
Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. One thousand copies of each
