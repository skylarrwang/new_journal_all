see how much power can be shared in 
a non-academic way.”
By the time Allis came to Yale, she 
knew how powerful knowledge could 
be outside an academic space from her 
healthcare advocacy as a doula, and she 
had a sense of how powerful knowledge 
could be within academia from her 
experience at SAC. In “Education and 
Empire,” Allis didn’t find that power 
again until she read A Third University 
is Possible by la paperson in late October 
last semester.­­

I ask Allis about the book while 
we sit outside of the Beinecke, a week 
after our first interview in her apart-
ment. She takes it out of her backpack. 
Its exterior is unimposing, a bright 
blue cover holding a thin seventy pages, 
hardly bigger than my hand. The inte-
rior, though, is a dense work of schol-
arship full of obscure allusions to film 
theory and sentences like “we have the 
pitfall of anthropocentrism.” It is the 
kind of book that Allis would have 
once dismissed as stuffy philosophy, far 
removed from the practical knowledge 
that she considered empowering.

One quote in Allis’ copy is under-
lined deeply enough to indent the page: 
“The university is an assemblage. It is 
a giant machine composed of myriad 
working parts, multiple systems. Each 
part can still be thought of as a dis-
crete organism to be unplugged and 
replugged somewhere else.” In the mar-
gin, Allis noted, “Thinking of myself as 
part of an assemblage . . . helps ease the 
mounting pressure of success that this 
place perpetuates.”

She explains her note to me: “I 
think ultimately the first weeks I was in 
TZB’s class . . . I felt confused because up 
“I wanted people to 
know what’s going on 
in their bodies before 
they let anyone else 
handle their insides.”
until that point I had interpreted suc-
cess in this place on what we see like 
on the pamphlets and what we see at 
orientations, becoming the next Ian 
Shapiro.” When she read the book, the 
knowledge Allis understood from her 
life as an activist and the knowledge she 
learned at Yale clicked into alignment. 
“Thinking of myself as just this piece 
of an assemblage where I can plug and 
plug whenever I want gave me so much 
agency.” The pressure Allis felt to fit 
what she perceived as the Yale version 
of success lifted. “[The book] kind of 
gave me my power back.” For Allis, this 
power resides in her ability to retool the 
knowledge she absorbs from texts like 
A Third University is Possible and classes 
like “Education and Empire” to suit 
the version of success she strives for in 
her advocacy. 

Now, Allis’ successes branch through 
New Haven. At IRIS, Allis works 
with the Services for Undocumented 
Neighbors team to help immigrants 
who are new to New Haven navigate 
the healthcare system. At an academic 
forum in April, Allis read an intro-
duction for Awa before she presented 
her biomedical research on malaria. At 
Professor Zemach-Bersin’s house, Allis 
throws a ball for TZB’s frenetic Boston 
terrier, Frankie, while they catch up on 
life and work.

Allis and I became friends after she 
read A Third University is Possible, when 
she reached out to me to ask if I wanted 
to get a coffee. It was early November, 
and we sat outside of the Blue State 
behind the business school with our 
laptops between us, chatting and work-
shopping ideas for an upcoming paper. 
By the time we finished talking, Blue 
State was closed and we were both 
significantly puffier, having layered on 
hats and sweaters when the setting sun 
dragged the temperature down with it. 

As we sit outside of the Beinecke 
five months later, a breeze lifts the war-
bles of returning birds over the rumble 
of traffic from York Street. Behind us, 
the Schwarzman Center announces 
itself in an incontrovertible wall of stone, 
but we are too busy to notice, laughing 
over the story I tell Allis about my first 
pap smear.

It’s one of the first days of spring, 
and the leaves are budding.∎
Grace Ellis is a sophomore in 
Benjamin Franklin College.

They started planning “Know Yo Self,” a 
day-long workshop where Allis and Ser 
taught participants skills for reproduc-
tive health literacy, ranging from mas-
sage techniques to information about 
menstruation. 

Of the roughly twenty people who 
participated in “Know Yo Self,” some 
were full-time community organizers 
while others worked at reproductive 
healthcare clinics. Some had children 
while others had no interest in becom-
ing parents. Allis describes the commu-
nity she built around “Know Yo Self ” 
as “tight-knit,” knotted together at the 
heart of San Antonio by their queer-
ness, and their commitment to making 
reproductive healthcare accessible. 

The group of attendees gathered for 
“Know Yo Self ’s” main activity: a lesson 
in how to use a speculum to perform a 
self-exam of their cervixes—the mus-
cular tissue that connects the uterus to 
the vagina. Some gynecologists advise 
against checking your cervix, since it can 
be difficult to understand how the tis-
sue should feel, and doctors will usually 
perform the exam during regular visits. 
But for communities that can’t access 
consistent health care, Allis emphasizes 
the important gap in knowledge that 
self-exams can fill. “When you can’t 
afford to go to the gynecologist,” she 
explains, people “learn to do things their 
own way . . . People are going to stick 
things in their vagina. People are going 
to have abortions.” 

Allis emphasizes that there can be a 
risk in a self-driven approach to health-
care if your speculum isn’t sanitized or 
you don’t understand your anatomy: 
“That’s why education is so important.” 
By teaching workshop participants how 
to examine themselves safely, Allis and 
Ser offered them practical reproductive 
health knowledge—the ability to know 
how their body usually looks and feels, 
so that when something doesn’t feel 
right, they can seek help.

At “Know Yo Self,” Allis saw her 
cervix for the first time, and she cried. 
“I cried because I was seeing a part of 
my system that was handled many 
years before by strangers.” In that 
moment, Allis’ desire to help members 
of her community advocate for them-
selves crystallized. “I wanted people 
to know what’s going on in their bod-
ies before they let anyone else han-
dle their insides.” The workshop was 
a turning point for Allis. “It ignited 
something in me that allowed me to
