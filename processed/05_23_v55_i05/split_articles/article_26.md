The first time I came home after being gone, I felt 
as if I was meeting myself for the first time. The apartment 
was the same—cluttered, askew, and dense with the scent of 
bodies being bodies.


My father glanced up from his desk when he heard the 
door open.
“You’re back,” he remarked. “We’re eating at 7.”
I used to believe that my home was hiding things from 
me. I had strange dreams about secret rooms tucked behind 
racks of clothing in my parents’ closet and treasure hidden in 
the folds of winter blankets. 
“Are you looking for something?” my mother asked when 
she noticed me trying to dislodge a drawer sealed shut with 
old paint and humidity. 
“I just wanted to see what was in there.”
“I think it’s empty. It’s been stuck for as long as I can 
remember.” 
My parents were wary of leaving me alone as a child. I 
was sure that a bookshelf would fall on me or my popcorn 
would catch fire in the microwave, and I had a bad feeling 
about the man who lived on the 14th floor. At eleven, when 
I had long outgrown a babysitter, I went exploring in earnest. 
Alone, I found a dusty key at the bottom of a bowl of oranges 
and several paperback books of poetry in my father’s sock 
drawer. The inscriptions on the first pages read To David and 
To David, again. But I already knew that my father’s first 
wife was a poet, and none of our locks yielded themselves 
to the key. In the closet, I burrowed into the musky folds 
of old coats with my arms outstretched, but all I found was 
a chalky wall that left white residue on my fingertips—no 
hidden rooms. Eventually, I gave up looking and tried on 
my mother’s nightgowns and undergarments. I imagined a 
time when I too would smell powdery and dress like I had 
something to hide. 

As I spent more time alone, I lost interest in finding 
something hidden. When I finally left, I worried that I had 
left something behind. 

Now that I was back, I felt a new heaviness in the air. 
The wooden doorframes had warped so the only way to shut 
doors was to slam them, and a spot of rust on the refrigerator 
had spread like a rash. The dogs twitched nervously when my 
mother clanked down the hallway on her new crutches. She 
had broken her leg falling in the snow.
“A glass dining table represents an unstable family,” she 
declared at dinner.
I carved a circle in the cloudy grime on our table’s glass 
surface, which was scarcely visible under piles of outdated papers.
“I thought you might want to read them,” my father said, 
as if the news did not reach me where I had been.

When my parents left for work the next day, I felt 
the familiar desire to discover something buried. The 
bookshelf seemed like a dull place to hunt for secrets, but 
a leatherbound volume on the bottom shelf caught my 
attention. Surely I had seen it before, but it must have seemed 
so uninteresting that it did not even register in my memory. 
The book was heavier than I expected. On the first page were 
pasted photographs of young people at a party, grinning and 
strewn about in the manner of those who know they are 
beautiful. The paint on the walls behind them was flaking 
off in long, mournful strips and beer cans stood precariously 
on leaning towers of books. As I flipped the page, I noticed 
how the threshold of the kitchen jutted out just so—it was 
undeniably our apartment. And the posture of the woman in 
the back corner of the photograph was undeniably that of my 
mother.
In the following pages, I watched her pose at the top of a 
mountain and kiss men I had never seen before. I noticed the 
way her cheeks pushed up past her eyes and her nose sunk 
below her top lip when she smiled. I hated these features of 
my own face, but on this stranger, they were charming. Most 
of the pictures were taken in our apartment, where the only 
recognizable features were the moldings and electrical outlets. 
Disheveled men leaned against walls now covered in my 
baby pictures.
I always knew, in a vague sort of way, that my mother 
had lived here long before I came around, but I had not 
considered the weight of accretion. The very floor and walls—
my floor and my walls—were the site of her parties and 
bygone friends, the ones she sometimes talked about as if she 
had been alive forever.
