their own training, they recognized Shirley’s kind-
ness toward survivors of sexual violence. Still, K. felt 
strange about approaching someone related to their 
job. They remembered thinking, “Man, this is really 
fucking weird.”

K. also initially felt awkward telling their bosses 
about the assault—after all, they were a University 
employee, and the OGCC coordinators were the 
ones who signed their paychecks. They ultimately 
grew comfortable enough to be vulnerable with 
them after a CCE friend reassured them that the 
nature of their work is to understand situations 
like theirs. Their friends in the program supported 
them through their experience, often offering them 
a place to talk through their emotions while provid-
ing a shoulder to rest on.

“We have a tendency to over-intellectualize our 
experiences in a way that can be challenging to give 
enough space for the human, personal elements 
of those experiences,” K. explained. “I have all this 
hefty consent-based vocabulary that I can use in an 
academic context. But where does that leave space 
for my rage, and my pain, and my sadness?”

When students process their feelings about a 
sexual situation, CCEs take care not to use words like 
“rape,” “harrassment,” or “assault” if the person does 
not do so themselves. 

“If someone’s talking about a ‘really weird hook 
up,’ we just help them work through a ‘really weird 
hook up,’” Kanga explained to me. “We have the 
skills and the trainings to just be a validating and 
listening ear that I think really helps.”

Unlabeled incidents that are concerning to the 
CCEs—which CCE Maya Fonkeu ’25 called “events 
of concerns”—wouldn’t be officially reported to the 
OGCC or Title IX office, even if they’d be considered 
sexual misconduct based on Yale’s definitions. So, 
students would never get that email with support-
ive resources from Title IX, unless they labeled their 
experiences of misconduct on their own. 

Naina Agrawal-Hardin ’25, an Associate Editor 
of The New Journal, works with the national orga-
nization Know Your IX, which aims to end sexual 
and dating violence in schools through education 
on survivors’ rights through Title IX. Because the 
CCE program and SHARE are often successful at pro-
viding students individual attention and support, 
Agrawal-Hardin said, many people may decide 
against going to Title IX or other administrative 
bodies for accommodations. 

“On the one hand, it’s really excellent that 
students are able to circumvent these systems 
that often are traumatizing, are really lengthy, or 
really exhausting, or don’t always turn out in your 
favor,” she told me. “On another level . . . Yale has 
a lot more discretion about what numbers it dis-
closes, and how it represents the scale of the issue 
on campus.”

Since privacy concerns and confidentiality rules 
govern Title IX and the UWC, it’s difficult to know 
how many people who make disclosures to CCEs 
ultimately end up going to the Title IX office for a 
follow-up. Most CCEs I spoke to estimated that the 


majority of students who come to them do not con-
tinue onto Title IX, but stated that they couldn’t be 
completely sure. Shirley told me in her email that 
“many students who receive initial outreach from 
Title IX do follow up,” but declined to share more 
about numbers. Even if students decline to follow 
up with Title IX, the office’s official reports still 
include their disclosures. 

Outside sexual misconduct surveys might pro-
vide more clarity. In the spring of 2019, Yale partic-
ipated in the Association of American Universities’ 
Campus Climate Survey, which estimated that 38.7 
percent of the women and 15.4 percent of the men 
at Yale College experienced some kind of sexual 
assault. The 2018-2019 student body totaled 5,964, 
indicating that at least 1,600 students experienced 
sexual assault. But from fall 2015 to spring 2019, 
Title IX received only two hundred forty-six disclo-
sures of sexual assault, according to its semiannual 
reports on sexual misconduct cases.

Because Title IX is two semesters behind on 
releasing its reports, their most recent statistics on 
sexual misconduct at Yale date back to 2021. That 
year, there were a total of one hundred fifty-two 
disclosures of sexual harrassment, sexual assault, 
intimate partner violence, stalking, and other rec-
ognized forms of misconduct reported to Title IX, 
the UWC, and the Yale Police Department (YPD). 
Seventeen of these disclosures involved the YPD, 
while ten primarily involved the UWC. Of the eight 
resolved UWC cases, the UWC found sufficient evi-
dence of sexual misconduct in five. The outcome of 
those five resulted in  “respondent-focused responses” 
including written reprimands, sexual consent aware-
ness training, suspension, and expulsion. 

When K. was weighing their options, they reck-
oned with their general beliefs against the punitive 
UWC system and the raw pain they experienced fol-
lowing the assault. K. knew ostracizing perpetrators 
didn’t necessarily call for a “growth mindset.” They 
believe putting perpetrators through the punitive 
system, whether it’s the UWC or the carceral sys-
tem, can reproduce harm in the long run. But these 
beliefs didn’t change the fact that their assailant had 
harmed them, too. For a while, they struggled to 
reconcile their broader ideological beliefs on pun-
ishment with their personal feelings toward their 
assailant. 

“I felt like being a CCE seems so much more like 
the former to me, and being a person felt like the 
latter,” K. confessed. 

Although the CCE program and UWC were both 
created in 2011 in response to the public reckoning 
with sexual misconduct at Yale, the UWC representa-
tives only spoke directly to the CCEs this past semes-
ter. The experience was “exciting” to CCE Josephine 
Cureton ’24. 

“It definitely was not your typical CCE meeting 
at all,” she said. 

During the usual CCE training at the start of 
each semester, representatives from SHARE and 
Title IX directly speak to the CCEs, with explana-
tions of the UWC usually handled by the Title IX 


representatives. They also tended to give far less 
extensive information on the process. When I asked 
Cureton about what she learned, she whipped out 
a notebook and flipped through a list of the com-
plicated factors that go into the UWC’s investiga-
tion process: types of text and video evidence they 
accept, the amount needed to reject or move for-
ward with complaints, students’ ability to hire their 
own lawyers, policies on the cross-examination of 
witnesses, and more. 

The consultation with the UWC changed the 
way Cureton discusses paths forward with those 
who make disclosures. She wasn’t previously aware 
of much of the information presented, including 
the UWC’s “rigid” application of Yale’s definition of 
sexual misconduct to accept or reject complaints. 
In order for a complaint to move forward with the 
UWC, investigators need to believe there is above 
a fifty percent chance that the event actually hap-
pened. They can also choose to reject evidence—for 
example, if investigators feel that a text message 
doesn’t say enough, they can toss that piece of evi-
dence. Cureton never tells people they should go to 
any specific place, but the consultation confirmed to 
her that some institutional bodies are more likely to 
meet students’ immediate needs than others.

“I think normally if someone wants to go some-
where, SHARE is the place to go first because they 
are a lot better with guiding them with resources,” 
Cureton said. “I don’t think I can tell anyone in 
good conscience that the UWC is gonna solve all of 
your problems.”

Ultimately, healing for K. did not involve pur-
suing a response for their assailant through the UWC, 
but elsewhere. Meanwhile, they still wrestled with 
impostor syndrome when they reflected on their 
assault, often feeling torn between their identity as 
a CCE and their identity as a person. If anyone else 
had come to them as a CCE with a similar experi-
ence of sexual assault, K. told me in retrospect, they 
would have felt far more concerned about them 
than they did for themselves. They began to ques-
tion whether they were good at their job, especially 
as they tried to balance their personal feelings 
towards assault with the education they received 
during CCE meetings. 

Beyond their own experiences with sexual 
violence, CCEs’ special roles as both employees 
and students can put them in tricky or emo-
tionally taxing situations when disclosures are made 
by people they know—or about people they know. 

“Oftentimes there’s this feeling of ickiness,” 
Cureton told me, noting that her feelings usually 
depend on the specific situation. “It’s really hard to 
put into words.”

Magley, meanwhile, described situations where 
people he knew were perpetrators as “shocking, and 
scary, and sad, and disappointing.”

Because CCEs play a dual role of employee and 
student, their work status often impacts the ways 
they navigate friendships with other students. As
