St. Paul, Minnesota
Returning from a walk, we reach our house and see the light 
burst a hole through the living 
room window, sidewalks and roads glazed with ice,
mailboxes tight-lipped. 
I look up at mother, watch the snow 
rest on her eyelashes.
Around us, the snowblowers and snowplow-trucks begin 
once more, another morning. 
My father’s part of the crew as well.
In the distance, a train just visible above the treetops.
The women enter the house, 
stay there. Wanting to help my father, I go in, 
change into snowpants, then run back outside, 
hop toward my shovel, 
which is leaning against empty pots and the gutter.
It has a plastic red blade, like a matchstick—
In this scene, like others
to come, I am a child up to no good. 
See for yourself: how I grab the shiny handle, 
how unevenly the yard ignites.
