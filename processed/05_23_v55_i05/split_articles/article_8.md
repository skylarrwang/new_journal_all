raises crucial questions about power and accountability.

be whoever you are,’” Fantastic explains. 
“No one’s going to say something, you 
know, negative or hurtful or even just 
thoughtless.” 
Fantastic tells me that over the past 
seven years, ECG has been a place where 
LGBTQIA+ patrons have felt safe enough 
to come out. Some use ECG to figure out 
a different way of presenting themselves 
than they would at work or home or 
school. For a lot of players, ECG acts as a 
safe space to negotiate queerness. 
Elm City Games hosts its online 
community on Discord, where play-
ers mingle, talk smack, and organize 
game nights. This is where I struck up 
a conversation with Brenda W., who 
requested not to be identified by name 
as to not be outed to her parents. She 
replied to my post, commenting that 
her first experience using her preferred 
name as an openly trans woman was at 
ECG: “I never once have had reason to 
regret that decision.”
Brenda had mostly been interacting 
with the ECG community through the 
Discord server, when she started ques-
tioning her gender. She had yet to settle 
on a name, a hesitation she explained 
was “mostly due to internalized anxiety 
on my part, making me doubt . . . whether 
or not the name I chose was right, 
whether it would feel good hearing other 
people use it, as well as worrying about 
what would happen if word got back to 
my parents.” 
She happened to be in for a game 
of Armada with another player from the 
ECG Discord, who only knew her by her 
username. They were making comfort-
able small talk before the match, until 
he asked for her name. Her mind went 
blank; the little script she’d rehearsed in 
her head went out the window. 
“I just stood there awkwardly for a 
moment and explained that I was trans 
and in between names at the moment,” 
she explained to me over Discord mes-
sage. “He was totally cool with it, so 
I took my shot with my favorite of the 
choices I’d been kicking around.” She 
told him she was trying the name Brenda. 
Hearing the other player sound her 
name out back to her abated her initial 
anxieties. “From that moment on, I’ve 
been Brenda and I couldn’t be happier.”
When I asked what made Brenda 
feel that ECG was safe enough to come 
out, she pointed to the store’s owners, 
Matt Fantastic and Trish Loter, who 
both had multiple pronouns listed 
under their Discord usernames, and 
who, in her eyes, “generally cultivated 
a left-leaning political culture and atti-
tude, both in-store and in the server.” 
Other stores Brenda had visited didn’t 
feel quite as welcoming; one store in 
Wallingford was particularly rude to 
new customers and tolerated homopho-
bic remarks made by other clientele. 
“Games traditionally have a reputa-
tion for being this domain of, you know, 
shitty men,” Fantastic explained to me, 
“There’s just this kind of casual shitti-
ness.” ECG aims to upend that. Fantastic 
describes the archetypal board gamer 
as the “um, actually” player who’s a real 
stickler for the rules. Ben Walter, a staff 
member at Yale’s Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion by day and a Magic: the 
Gathering (Magic) regular by night, 
recalls the experience of playing at a 
Magic convention, describing it as “a 
rules, lawyerly environment.” A lot of 
the fun in Magic, for Walter, lies in the 
tabletop conversation during which alli-
ances and rivalries are formed. ECG game 
nights are typically more conversational 
and allow players to backtrack, whereas 
official Magic games are played strictly 
by the book. If you blurt out any inac-
curacies, Walter explains, the “um, actu-
ally” gamers are quick to cut you off and 
recite the rulebook. He pauses, searching 
for the right words to name this impulse. 
“It becomes this very mansplainy, mas-
culine desire to prove yourself by being 
right . . . So it’s not fun, honestly.”
For DnD game night—the store’s 
most popular game—Dungeon Masters 
(DMs) are briefed on ECG’s standards.

rom that very first night I 
happened by Chapel Street, I was 
charmed. Maybe it was the hot pink 
facade that unapologetically spans three 
storefronts. Maybe it was the two life-
sized kobolds—a kind of monster from 
Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)—that 
grumbled at me from the window display 
with their spears raised, like guardians at 
the shop’s front door. It was most prob-
ably, though, the ambience of Elm City 
Games (ECG) on a busy night: tables by 
the windows were filled with customers 
chatting away, while a giant rainbow flag 
greeted passersby.
“It’s just our natural state of being,” 
says Elm City Games owner Matt 
Fantastic, whose larger-than-life last 
name evolved from a joke gone too far. 
“We’re queer-owned . . . and most of our 
staff is some varying flavor.” 
Originally founded in 2016 as a cor-
ner inside the now-shuttered Happiness 
Lab café, the business has grown along 
with its community to take on three 
storefronts, which now house some 
of the three thousand items in inven-
tory that line the store’s floor-to-ceil-
ing shelves. The brightly painted rooms 
flanking the store’s interior are the game 
café areas where, for ten or twenty bucks, 
customers are free to play on one of the 
shop’s game nights.
With their Hell Fire’s Club baseball 
hat and long unruly hair, Fantastic ini-
tially struck me as Eddie Munson from 
Stranger Things come to life. Like Eddie, 
Fantastic grew up playing Dungeons and 
Dragons, and evoking Eddie’s famous 
guitar solo of Metallica’s “Master of 
Puppets,” Fantastic had a brief career in 
the nineties Brooklyn musicscape, where 
they played in “loud angry bands.” 
Though 
Fantastic 
nonchalantly 
answers that the store is queer-owned, 
the abundant progressive imagery that 
pervades the store—the massive rainbow 
sidewalks just outside, the little queer 
identity flag stickers for sale—is very 
intentional. As Fantastic affectionately 
characterizes it, the store’s strategy is to 
be “aggressively progressive.” 
“It’s important to put it really out 
there that ‘hey, you can come here and
