2022, she was rejected.
According 
to 
Professor 
Talya 
“TZB” Zemach-Bersin, who teaches 
“Education and Empire” and lectures 
in the Education Studies department, 
there were around ninety applications to 
the class. On the Fall 2022 Canvas page 
for “Education and Empire,” prerequi-
sites were listed as “None (Preference for 
students who have already taken EDST 
110)”. Allis had spent a decade teaching 
health literacy, but had not taken EDST 
110, “Foundations in Education Studies,” 
and she had not expressed an interest in 
the Education Studies program in her 
application. A few hours before Add/
Drop period ended, Professor Zemach-
Bersin emailed her: there was an open 
spot. In the second week of the semester, 
she attended her first class.

“I’ll never forget on my first day TZB 
said heg– hag– ah, I can’t even pro-
nounce it now! Hegemony.” Allis raised 
her hand to ask what the word meant, 
Professor Zemach-Bersin explained, 
and the class moved on. It seemed like 
everyone else knew the word, respond-
ing quickly with thoughtful connec-
tions to the dense readings and other 
word salads. “I felt immediately that I 
wasn’t supposed to be in that space.”

After the first day, though, Allis kept 
coming to class, and eventually got off 
the waitlist. Every time she stood on 
Wall Street before class, marshaling the 
nerve to go inside, she reminded herself 
that she wanted to learn. And, she rea-
soned, wasn’t that why she came to Yale 
in the first place?

Well, part of the reason. In her 
health advocacy work, she noticed the 
power knowledge could hold. By the 
time Allis applied to San Antonio 
Community College (SAC) in 2018, Allis 
had worked as a doula for five years, see-
ing firsthand how information about 
birth control and obtaining safe abor-
tions could change her clients’ lives. The 
knowledge she learned and shared in 
her work as a doula, though, had not 
earned Allis a stable income. In higher 
education, she searched for the currency, 
intellectual and literal, that she needed 
to build a more financially stable life.

While Allis was studying biology 
at SAC, the word “teratoma” unboxed a 
memory. Allis finally grasped the sci-
ence behind what happened to her in 
2000—that her tumor, a teratoma, was 
born in her reproductive cells. There, the 
teratoma grew as it collected nearby tis-
sues into a dense mass. 
of the irrevocable condition she calls 
home. Through the ten years she spent 
organizing in the reproductive justice 
movement, she was a student and a 
teacher. She learned from fellow activ-
ists in late-night conversations and 
cross-legged knowledge-sharing circles. 
She taught her students reproductive 
health literacy in living rooms, massage 
studios, and abortion clinics. 
“This is how I started.” Allis gestures 
to a flier in the middle of the table that 
advertised what she considers her first 
foray into mutual aid work as a doula. 
Under the title, Hojas de Servicio, white 
flowers bloom on a black background. It 
reads: “Leaves of Service.” The services 
Allis offered included massages, consul-
tations on contraceptives, and tutorials to 
help her clients understand their anatomy. 
In exchange, she accepted any amount 
clients could afford to pay, or any item 
they could barter (on one occasion, three 
bottles of kombucha). Allis’ flier sum-
marizes her goal: to “make alternative 
therapies accessible to the San Antonio 
community who are unable to afford 
holistic health care.”


A
llis launched Hojas de Servicio 
in 2013 after the Texas State 
Legislature passed House Bill 2 (HB 2), 
expanding statewide restrictions on 
reproductive health care and abortion 
providers. The ratification unearthed 
Allis’ memories from that night in the 
emergency room. “I was reminded of 
what it felt like to have somebody else 
tell me what to do with my body,” Allis 
remembers.

The surgery left Allis with one less 
ovary and questions that still blink at her 
like hospital fluorescents through the 
darkness of her bedroom in the hours 
before she falls asleep. Why had his first 
thought been sterilization? Who were 
his other patients? 
She wonders, “What happened to 
the women who didn’t get a chance to 
speak up?” 

These are the questions that guided 
Allis’ work in the reproductive justice 
movement. After HB 2’s ratification, the 
number of women’s healthcare clinics 
that offered abortions reduced by half 
in the span of three years, and patients 
who couldn’t afford healthcare or find 
a clinic near them sought alternatives. 
Through her work on Hojas de Servicio, 
Allis offered an alternative in the 
form of conversations and pamphlets 
exchanged between friends with a con-
crete, practical goal: expanding access 
to informed health care. Knowledge, in 
Allis’ view, was something to share.

At Yale, the knowledge that Allis 
had cherished in her work as an activist 
took a distorted form. It was compressed 
into 250-word Canvas discussion posts 
and castle-side classrooms. Allis found 
that Yalies trade knowledge, too, but 
as currency: a well-written paper in 
exchange for an A, an oozing email 
in exchange for acceptance to a class.

“[Ser] was the first academic that 
I didn’t feel that with,” Allis explains. 
They were a radical activist who orga-
nized against institutional structures of 
oppression, and they were a sharp crit-
ical thinker who leveraged institutional 
power to achieve their goals.

Allis remembers staying up late with 
Ser, “talking feministy stuff.” While they 
were talking about Ser’s research on ster-
ilization, a question that had lingered in 
Allis’ mind since the night of her surgery 
resurfaced. If it was possible to save half 
her reproductive system in the end, why 
had sterilization been her doctor’s first 
course of action?

Through her conversations with Ser, 
Allis learned about the romance between 
eugenics and reproductive healthcare for 
Latine patients in America. She learned 
about the widespread sterilization of 
Puerto Rican women throughout the 
twentieth century by doctors who adver-
tised la operación as the only available 
birth control. She learned about the 
“twenty thousand patients recommended 
for sterilization between 1919 and 1953” 
in California, patients who were dispro-
portionately Latine. She learned about 
how the funding Margeret Sanger and 
Planned Parenthood provided for the 
Gathering this information cleared 
the shame and confusion that had 
obscured her memories of the surgery. 
“It was a relief for me.” Beyond relief, 
Allis began to feel she had control over 
her understanding of the surgery. At 
SAC, Allis realized the knowledge that 
she learned in a higher education space 
could make her feel powerful. 

Encouraged by her experience at 
SAC, Allis applied to four-year colleges in 
Texas, wanting to stay close to home. Her 
top choice was the University of Texas 
at Austin. But she knew she couldn’t 
afford to pay for tuition, so she Googled 
“undergrad for nontraditional students 
big endowment,” and the Eli Whitney 
program popped up. 

It was the first time Allis had 
thought about Yale since the nineties, 
when she watched Jessica’s meltdown 
after the Ivy League rejected her in the 
sitcom Saved by the Bell. When Yale 
accepted Allis with an offer that would 
cover her tuition and rent, she figured, 
why not? “I was tired of being broke.”

A year into her time at Yale, Allis 
felt far away from home and far away 
from the power in knowledge she 
found at SAC. She was battling new 
questions: Why did she come to Yale, 
and why should she stay here?

These are the questions we mull over 
while we sit across from each other in Allis’ 
apartment. The awkwardness of our inter-
view subsides, and we talk about how Allis’ 
years of reproductive justice work connect 
to her life as an Eli Whitney student.

After HB 2 passed in 2013, Allis didn’t 
launch Hojas de Servicio right away. The 
shape her activism would take was not 
clear to Allis until she got a call from her 
friend and reproductive justice activist, 
Serpentina. Allis met Ser when she was 
living in California in 2010. Across the 
dance floor at a West Oakland music fes-
tival, Allis saw “this beautiful statuesque 
person.” Ser stands over six feet, Allis adds, 
raising her hands over her head to demon-
strate: “like, tall.” 
“I went up to them and just started 
dancing with them, and that was the 
beginning of our friendship,” Allis 
says. At the time, Allis was training in 
massage therapy, and Ser was work-
ing on their undergraduate thesis at 
the University of California, Berkeley: 
“Forced Sterilizations in Peru during 
the Fujimori Dictatorship.” 
Before 
Allis 
met 
Ser, 
she 
approached college students with 
some suspicion. “All throughout my 
twenties,” Allis remembers, “I was 
the person basically telling people 
that college wasn’t needed to measure 
someone’s intellect.” She perceived a 
divide between radicals, who learned 
from their communities, and academ-
ics, who learned from a bank of pre-
scriptive knowledge.

At Yale, the knowledge that 
Allis had cherished in her 
work as an activist took 
a distorted form. It was 
compressed into 250-word 
Canvas discussion posts 
and castle-side classrooms. 
Allis found that Yalies 
trade knowledge, too, but 
as currency: a well-written 
paper in exchange for an A, an 
oozing email in exchange for 
acceptance to a class.

didn’t transfer to the American medical 
system, Awa enrolled at Georgia State 
to study biology. When she noticed a 
message from the Eli Whitney program 
in her inbox, she thought it was a spam 
email. Like Allis, she only knew Yale 
from American TV dramas where hot, 
rich teenagers agonize over acceptances.

Bonding over their commitment to 
healthcare and their confusion about 
their sudden transformation into Yalies, 
Allis and Awa became close friends. 
When Allis is thinking about something 
she learned in class, when she needs 
someone to give her a ride, when she 
needs a sounding board for her frustra-
tions about Yale, she calls Awa. “Awa has 
been everything for me.”

Allis remembers how Ser captured 
that “everything” feeling too. More 
than an academic, Ser was “a punk, an 
artist, a radical thinker, and [a] critic,” 
and they were the friend Allis turned to 
when she felt frustrated and confused 
after HB 2 was passed.

In July 2013, Ser called Allis with 
an idea: would Allis help them host a 
knowledge share? By then, Allis had 
moved to San Antonio, and Ser flew 
down from the West Coast to join her. 
Puerto Rican pill trials in the nine-
teen-fifties and the history of feminists 
who dismissed Latine patients’ agency, 
minimizing the experiences of those 
who willingly chose sterilization.

Through the lens of her new knowl-
edge, Allis was able to view her brush 
with sterilization in context of this col-
lective history. With Ser, Allis pieced 
through these accounts, the current state 
of sterilizations in the U.S., and the ques-
tions that these realities raise about race, 
gender, and bodily autonomy until the 
sun turned the Oakland skyline shades 
of orange. 

Allis hoped that, at Yale, she would 
continue the critical conversations that 
she had started with Ser in Oakland, but 
her suspicion toward academia hadn’t 
subsided. Academia was central to the 
structures of power that Allis aimed to 
disrupt through her healthcare advo-
cacy. Yale, she knows, is deeply rooted 
in these power structures. The American 
Eugenics Society was headquartered at 
Yale from 1926 to 1938, and supported 
legislation that permitted involuntary 
sterilizations while Yale-educated doc-
tors put law into practice. Allis strug-
gled to see how she would learn at an 
institution that had endowed students 
with knowledge they leveraged to harm 
the communities she had advocated to 
protect.

 The disconnect that Allis perceived 
between the Eli Whitney program and her 
“matriarchal, queer, activist, artist” commu-
nity from Texas deepened her hesitations. 
She remembers that the first event, a din-
ner for accepted Eli students, “felt very 
cis male, hetero, military—just the total 
opposite of the world I was coming from.”

At that dinner, Allis met Awa, an 
Eli Whitney student studying Molecular, 
Developmental, and Cellular Biology. 
Awa remembers Allis’ “very bubbly,” 
enthusiastic voice responding, “wow, 
like water?” when Awa introduced her-
self. Reflecting on that moment, Allis 
thinks it’s fitting that Awa’s name trans-
lates to water “because she has been like 
water for me in this experience [at Yale]. 
She’s been necessary, and I’m so grateful 
for her and to her.” 

Awa resonated with Allis’ experi-
ence of coming to Yale with knowledge 
that did not fit a Western standard. Awa 
had worked as a nurse in Senegal for 
five years before she immigrated to the 
U.S. in 2018. Finding that her credentials
