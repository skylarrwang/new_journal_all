I 
did not see the iwi kūpuna1, but 
their presence hollowed my bones. 
Beside me in the cramped backseat 
of a minivan, beneath the exhausted light 
of a New England autumn afternoon, 
beneath layers of carefully wrapped black 
cloth, beneath a box, lie the mandibles 
and teeth of unnumbered, unidentified 
kanaka maoli2. The gray sky framed by 
the car window becomes my imaginative 
canvas for the iwi; the cultural protocol 
of traditional Native Hawaiian repatri-
ation prohibits wahine3 from any direct 
interface with them. Josh, who is able to 
handle the iwi, describes them to me as 
cold, stripped of humanity by the scien-
tific method, displaced for the sake of 
museum archival preservation. I consider 
it a blessing that cultural protocol shields 
me from seeing this forced displacement 
from all axes of existence, though I per-
sist to imagine their vitality.

On October 4, 2022, Hi‘ilei Hobart, 
Assistant 
Professor 
of 
Native 
and 
Indigenous Studies,  participated along-
side undergraduates Kala‘i Anderson 
’25, Joshua Ching ’26, and I in a Native 
Hawaiian ceremonial repatriation of 
iwi kūpuna housed in the Yale Peabody 
Museum since the eighteen-seventies. 
We could not have completed this repa-
triation without the passage of the 
Native American Graves Protection 
and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, 
which, by U.S. federal law, mandates 
“the return of human remains, funerary 
objects, sacred objects, and objects of 
patrimony to lineal descendants, Native 
American tribes, Alaskan Natives, and 
Native Hawaiian organizations.” In 2014, 
the Peabody intended to repatriate these 
specific iwi to Hawai‘i; however, they were 
unknowingly separated from their larger 
shipment and remained in museum stor-
age. Eight years later, Professor Hobart 
found the iwi during a Peabody tour and, 
decisively, held the museum account-
able to initiate another repatriation.

October’s repatriation comes from 
a lineage of contemporary Native 
Hawaiian repatriation work that aims to 
heal the wounds of a violent colonial past. 
In their essay “Ka Huaka‘i O Nā ‘Ōiwi: 
The Journey Home”, Native Hawaiian 
repatriation scholars Edward Halealoha 
Ayau and Ty Kāwika Tengan write that 
colonialism has alienated kanaka maoli 
from their lands, histories, and gods. At 
the epicenter of this alienation is the 
desecration of gravesites, through which 
iwi are collected. Ayau and Tengan out-
line common justifications for the col-
lection of iwi kūpuna: use in eugenic 
studies and anthropological studies of a 
“disappearing race,” sales to collectors or 
educational institutions, and removal as 
a consequence of urbanization. Preceded 
by the repatriation work of contempo-
rary Native Hawaiian leaders, October’s 
repatriation is indebted to the strength 
and perseverance of all the kanaka maoli 
who have repatriated before us.

Although the seed of a lineage, this 
repatriation was the first at Yale to be led 
by the kanaka maoli of the University’s 
community. The increase in kanaka 
maoli involvement during this repatria-
tion compared to those past is not only 
reflective of Professor Hobart’s leader-
ship, but also of the unprecedented num-
ber of kanaka maoli now at Yale. The four 
of us kanaka maoli met daily to learn 
lyrics, practice reciting our mo‘okū‘au-
hau4 for as many generations back as 
we knew, refine intonation and pronun-
ciation, and most importantly, harness 
our voice. Preceded by a dense week of 
cultural programming—including the 
memorization of anchor pule5 and oli6 
that totaled over eighty lyrical lines of
