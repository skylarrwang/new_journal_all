To Care for a Community
Peer-led policing alternative COMPASS has seen 
a successful rollout in the past five months. But 
can an organization bankrolled by the City and 
run by Yale achieve radical aims? 


O
n the top floor of a converted 
Victorian home, in the heart of New 
Haven’s Dwight neighborhood, lives the 
city’s attempt at an alternative model to policing.
The old home is peaceful when I visit, its 
rooms awash in sunlight. Tenants putter from 
one floor to the next, their footsteps creaking 
against warm hardwood floors. This is a crisis 
respite house run by the nonprofit Continuum of 
Care, which provides refuge and short-term beds 
for people in crisis. “Some, but not enough,” says 
John Labieniec, one of multiple co-vice presi-
dents at the organization. 

Labieniec’s mild manner and casual dress—
sweatshirt, long hair tied back—fit right in as he 
guides me upstairs to what could be mistaken for 
an attic bedroom. In this room, a new organiza-
tion has moved in: Elm City COMPASS, short for 
“Compassionate Allies Serving Our Streets.” The 
initiative has been years in the making, envisioned 
as a clinician- and peer-led alternative to tradi-
tional policing in mental health and substance use 
crises. COMPASS has worked with three hundred 
and four people since its November 2022 launch 
(as of March 1), through a mix of responding to 
911 calls and conducting proactive outreach.

Although COMPASS’s office has a distinctly 
cozy and communal feel, New Haven’s biggest 
institutional forces are at work in this Dwight 
home. Yale University manages COMPASS in a 
partnership with the New Haven city govern-
ment, having secured $3.5 million of city and 
federal funding to administer the program. Yet, 
Yale’s name has been largely omitted from the 
COMPASS rollout.

COMPASS is one of the few initiatives across 
the country that is tangibly moving toward peer-
based alternatives to policing. Yet its collaboration 
with New Haven police and its integration with 
some of New Haven’s most entrenched institu-
tions—the city government and Yale University—
alienates 
some 
long-time 
harm 
reduction 
advocates. COMPASS’s launch then begs the ques-
tion: can an organization meant to disrupt the 
policing system still do so in collaboration with 
mainstream institutional mammoths?

AN ALTERNATIVE TO POLICING

C
OMPASS emerged from a time of “multi-
ple pandemics,” Jack Tebes, COMPASS director 
and Yale Professor of Psychiatry, told me, “one 
hundreds of years old and one more recent.”

Tebes’ two pandemics—one being centuries 
of racism and police brutality, and the other being 
COVID-19—intertwined in the summer of 2020, 
as masked protestors marched in the streets and 
called for police abolition in the wake of George 
Floyd’s murder. In response, the city of New 
Haven appropriated funds for a civilian crisis 
response team that would follow a new model of 
law enforcement and community care, soliciting 
applications from organizations up for the task. 
Tebes and his colleagues at Yale’s Consultation 
Center had long worked on crisis response 
matters and were selected to spearhead the 
new initiative. 

In the years of planning ahead of COMPASS’s 
launch, the initiative strove to involve New Haven 
residents as much as possible. Representatives 
from the city and Yale conducted focus groups 
and community forums, ultimately consulting 
more than two hundred and fifty community 
members, according to its website. Yale also sub-
contracted with Continuum of Care, long estab-
lished in the world of New Haven crisis response, 
to provide what Labieniec calls “boots on the 
ground” for the COMPASS operation. With this 
collaboration, Labieniec became the coordinator 
of COMPASS’s crisis response team.

COMPASS was slated to begin in mid-2021, but 
the launch was delayed over four times as the 
city struggled to find a subcontractor and final-
ize its contract with Yale. The city also contended 
with police and fire unions who wanted to bar-
gain over COMPASS’s plan of operation and the 
role that police and fire officials would play in its 
implementation. In August 2022, the police union 
filed a state labor board complaint saying that the 
city was going forward with the COMPASS launch 
without providing the launch plans to police. 
Ultimately the bargaining was resolved, but it did 
delay COMPASS’s launch yet again through the 
later half of 2022.

When the crisis response operation did 
launch, it did so in the form of a “secondary 
response” team, one that would only go out on a 
call if requested by police and fire operations. This 
ongoing collaboration with police, although tem-
porary, is leaving its mark.

In March, when city officials and police 
arrived at the West River, off Ella T. Grasso 
Boulevard, to clear the three-year-old Tent City 
encampment, COMPASS’s signature green jackets 
were present alongside them. As bulldozers rolled 
over the tents that had once housed sixteen peo-
ple, the COMPASS team members worked to find 
beds for those who were getting evicted. One 
Tent City resident, Barry Lawson, told The New 
Haven Register: “I was going to get arrested, but 
then I got offered a place [to stay] on Edgewood” 
by the COMPASS team.

Despite the care COMPASS provided, in 
moments like the Tent City clearing, said hous-
ing advocate Mark Colville, “the roles get a little 
weird.” Colville’s organization, Amistad Catholic 
Worker, is based nearby in The Hill neighborhood 
and helped organize and sustain Tent City for 
years. He believes that COMPASS’s alignment with 
the city during the mass eviction—even while 
they were just administering care to the evicted—
exemplifies the danger of a harm reduction
