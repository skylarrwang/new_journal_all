Dear readers,

A few weeks ago, we hosted our Bulldog Days event in a small room at 
the top of Phelps Hall. We did not belong there. Still, we set down our 
things and made it so—half-eaten bags of hot chips, a modest pile of tote 
bags, and enough Red Bulls to kill someone. We worried if people would 
come. Slowly, they did, and we welcomed a small cohort of five.

The New Journal began for us this way, too: a small group of editors, a 
small mess of junk food, and a small table at which we barely belonged. 
Over the past year, we have found a home here. This April, we welcomed 
back the people who have created their own homes in The New Journal, 
the people who have cared for this magazine over the course of nearly five 
decades. It seems this home is still as scrappy as they remember. 
But as we all do this time of year, we begin as we leave. 
In our board’s first issue, our stories interrogate the safe places many call 
home. Amelia Davidson’s cover story explores an approach to make 
New Haven a safer place to live—but some envision radically different 
ways to protect this peace. Megan Vaz parses out efforts to create systems 
of support against sexual violence, often at the expense of emotionally 
burdening our cces. Elisa Cruz writes of the struggle to make New Haven 
Public Schools sanctuaries, rather than sites of surveillance. 
While we work to make our existing homes more caring, we may negotiate 
the things that constitute them, creating something new yet familiar. 
Grace Ellis recalls her dear friend Allis’s path to the “irrevocable condition” 
of home. Connor Arakaki creates presence from absence as she weaves 
together fragments of her Indigenous Hawaiian identity. And to begin this 
issue as we end this letter, Ashley Chin introduces us to the found families 
of Elm City Games and the refuge to be found in play.

We are about to scatter around the globe, leaving some things behind and 
holding on to others. We hope you’ll take these stories with you as you go.
TNJ Love,
