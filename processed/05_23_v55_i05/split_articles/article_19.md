finished his CCE training, he informed his friends 
that he still wanted to be as intimate and support-
ive of a friend as possible, but that he was now a 
mandatory reporter on cases of misconduct. If they 
spoke about any such experiences in front of him, 
they could end up receiving an email from Shirley.

Receiving and reporting disclosures, though a 
clearly outlined aspect of CCEs’ responsibilities, can 
take a heavy emotional toll on students. YCC Vice 
President Fonkeu said she hadn’t initially imagined 
the range of duties and challenges the job would 
entail, including the impacts that receiving disclo-
sures would have on her own life. 

The distinction between the type of support 
CCEs are meant to give survivors and what they 
aren’t is murky, especially as CCEs themselves often 
go to OGCC staff to check-in on their wellbeing, talk 
through their feelings, and encourage them to seek 
professional emotional support resources.

“I’ve definitely leaned on OGCC a lot of times 
when those disclosures start to get heavy and sort 
of start to pervade into the other parts of my life,” 
Magley said. “The support that I got from staff 
members during various periods of more intense 
emotional labor from disclosures was really helpful.”

Elmileik wrote to me that CCEs may step back 
from the program if they feel doing so would be 
best for their wellbeing, and that it is possible for 
staff to assign them alternate office work if finances 
are a concern. K. confirmed this to me—although 
they did not step back from the program when they 
went through the Title IX process, Shirley men-
tioned taking a step back and performing alternate 
work as an option for them. 

It’s difficult to determine the number of sexual 
misconduct incidents that any CCE is told about, as 
defined by Yale policies. Because CCEs don’t impose 
their own definitions of what constitutes sexual 
misconduct onto students, they sometimes talk 
through the events of concern, which aren’t techni-
cally disclosures. In the past, Fonkeu has been trou-
bled enough by some of these instances that she’s 
gone directly to her OGCC bosses for help, receiving 
guidance in how to address the concerning dynam-
ics through follow-up conversations. 

Because CCEs must keep conversations with 
students confidential, I didn’t ask her what the 
outcomes of these follow-ups could entail, nor did 
I push the CCEs to give me information on how 
specific disclosures impacted their individual rela-
tionships. But the overall impacts of these conver-
sations lingered.

The number of disclosures Cureton receives 
fluctuates over a given period of time based on 
the social spaces she inhabits. Back when she was 
a member of a Greek life organization, she tended 
to get more disclosures than she does now. She 
emphasized the difficulty of navigating disclosures 
from people she knows personally, and that people 
tend to spring them on the CCEs at any time.

“Yes, you might be helping someone come 
to terms with and advance justice, and come to 
terms with something bad that happened to them,” 
Cureton said. “But it still feels really awful and dis-
heartening to hear some of these stories.”

Going through the Title IX process 
changed the way K. interacted with the sexual 
violence survivors who came to them for sup-
port. As a CCE, they began drawing clear distinctions 
about the expectations people should have coming 
into each support system, stressing that nothing 
is a one-stop shop and that survivors can choose 
the resources they receive depending on their spe-
cific needs. K.’s own path toward healing is of their 
own making—involving the no-contact agreement, 
cathartic conversations on friends’ common room 
floors, visits to Yale Mental Health and Counseling, 
and chats with their residential college dean.

In the beginning, K. viewed the work of a CCE 
as having a more one-off approach, pointing people 
to resources, maybe checking back in, but otherwise 
having finished their portion of the job. But, K. told 
me, their outlook on these conversations now signi-
fies “an ongoing relationship.” 

“[If a CCE-chat] does something for you, you’re 
not done yet, come back to me as a CCE,” K. said. 
“I’ll help you with step two.” 

Instead of listing off resources for sup-
port as “or’s,” K. began to list them off as “and’s.” 
Understanding this would have helped them tre-
mendously when they came into the Title IX office 
expecting to be emotionally healed.

CCEs, according to Elmileik, are supposed to be 
liaisons between student survivors and administra-
tive support systems—not primary point-people. 
But CCEs themselves spoke to different levels of 
engagement with students after initial disclosures. 
Some told me that due to the confidentiality rules 
governing the Title IX process, they usually let 
students go their way with little continued contact, 
leaving check-ins up to the survivors themselves. 
Others said that they continued to check in after 
the disclosure through their own initiative, whether 
it be through text updates about new resources or a 
coffee date where the assault is never even brought 
up.

Ultimately, the challenges CCEs face go beyond 
the already hefty responsibility of representing Yale 
and the program well. Toeing the line between 
employee and student comes with a set of expec-
tations from the students they serve, especially as 
organizations sometimes rely on them to ‘fix’ a toxic 
culture. But at the end of the day, CCEs are students 
who experience the social and sexual climate at Yale 
the same way the rest of us do. And no one’s an 
expert.

“Oftentimes, it’s easy to forget that we are stu-
dents like everyone else,” Magley told me. “And 
we go through similar things. And we struggle 
in similar ways as some of the people that we’re 
talking to.” ∎
