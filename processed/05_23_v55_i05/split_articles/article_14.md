$750,000 over the three-year duration of the con-
tract. Continuum of Care has made additional 
in-kind contributions that will total around 
three hundred thousand dollars, Tebes said. As 
COMPASS’s main representative from Yale, Tebes 
manages the entire budget.

The partnership between the city and Yale, 
and the lack of publicity surrounding the matter, 
raised alarm bells for some. In May 2022, when 
the contract became public, Nichole Roxas and 
Alice Shen, two former Yale Psychiatry resi-
dents published an op-ed in The New Haven 
Independent titled “COMPASS Critics To City: Be 
Transparent.” They wrote that “as two community 
psychiatrists, our patients tell us they do not trust 
the police in New Haven and, more than that, 
they do not trust Yale.”

“How did Yale sneak in on the cut? Did the 
city solicit community input about who would 
receive the money and how it would be spent? 
Would reported concerns be addressed?” the 
pair asked. 

When I asked Tebes similar questions, he 
pointed to COMPASS’s Community Advisory 
Board as an important check on Yale’s involve-
ment. The board currently contains nineteen New 
Haven residents from all walks of life, including 
one unhoused person. It meets four times a year 
in addition to separate small-group meetings and 
comes to decisions via group consensus on pol-
icies ranging from maintenance of the COMPASS 
website to what community resources it should 
provide. These meetings, according to Tebes, also 
ensure that Yale does not make any unilateral pol-
icy changes.

“We begin with humility, listening to com-
munity members, sharing any credit, centering 
our community, not centering Yale or ourselves,” 
Tebes added.

Faced with those same questions in the 
COMPASS office, Labieniec thought for a moment, 
and then quietly shared that he has not seen 
COMPASS’s affiliation with Yale as an alienating 
force when COMPASS helps out in the community. 
“There’s been nothing but warm, welcoming, pos-
itive excitement,” he said. “I personally have not 
seen anything, and I’m very involved.” Labieniec 
oversees the team every day, and occasionally 
accompanies them on calls.

Colville would say otherwise. In his opin-
ion, by taking up a huge amount of city land and 
then refusing to use their forty-two billion dol-
lar endowment to help the citizens they displace, 
Yale has become a catalyst of homelessness and 
poverty in New Haven, making their sponsorship 
of COMPASS come across as too little, too late.

“It is the university and the city government 
that are sort of colluding in promoting this myth 
of scarcity,” Colville said, “as if land and resources 
are too scarce to take care of the most low-in-
come people among us.”

Unlike Colville, David Agosta, a New Haven 
disability rights activist and former member of 
COMPASS’s Community Advisory Board, takes no 
issue with Yale’s involvement in COMPASS. “We 
recognize that Yale has the smartest people in the 
world,” he said. “When they do something right, 
they do it right.”

Yet Agosta recently resigned from the board 
due to frustration with a different partnering 
institution: the city of New Haven. Although he 
repeatedly expressed his admiration for every-
one involved in COMPASS, Agosta said that he 
could not remain on the board so long as the city 
refused to provide adequate beds and services for 
people without housing. He likened the COMPASS 
project, with the lack of current city resources for 
unhoused people, as “building a structure without 
a foundation.”

“It’s not about COMPASS; it’s that the mayor 
has not done his part to allow COMPASS to suc-
ceed. That’s why I resigned,” Agosta said. “If you 
talk to the folks there, there was evident frustra-
tion at the fact that there was no housing. You 
can’t really talk about it from the inside, so I had 
to do it from the outside.”

Colville also expressed concern at the city’s 
involvement with the project. Despite everything, 
he sees COMPASS as “a good concept.” However, 
he is critical of the current framework of New 
Haven’s government, and that within it, COMPASS 
will be unable to turn into the radical alternative 
to policing that it was originally envisioned to be.

“This happens all the time in New Haven,” he 
told me. “Is this just another liberal idea that usu-
ally tends to fizzle out at some point, especially 
when the cops start pushing back or when we get 
the next ‘law and order’ mayor?”

The 
current 
contract 
only 
guarantees 
COMPASS’s funding through June 2025, at which 
point New Haven, Yale, and Continuum of Care 
will have to renegotiate. A mayoral election is 
approaching, and as time passes from when 
public calls for policing alternatives had peaked 
in 2020, it is possible that COMPASS’s funding 
could dry up.

If it does, Labieniec will not let that mark the 
end of the initiative. Although Yale and the city 
of New Haven are large conglomerates, whose 
whims could change when it’s time to renew 
the contract in 2025, Continuum of Care is still 
a grassroots organization, and it is committed to 
COMPASS for the long run. Labieniec told me that 
he has already looked into alternative grants that 
could keep COMPASS up and running, should New 
Haven or Yale step out of the picture. 

“Our agency is invested in this,” he said. 

A solely nonprofit version of COMPASS, with-
out the financial backing of the city or the data-
driven work of Yale, might look radically different. 
A non-Yale, non-governmental COMPASS would 
be missing a significant and consistent source 
of funding, the guidance of a city-run advisory 
board, and the data-driven operational approach 

“It is the 
university 
and the city 
government 
that are sort 
of colluding
 in promoting 
this myth
 of scarcity,”
