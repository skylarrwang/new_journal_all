Twenty-three years after her 
operation, Allis and I are sitting 
together at the kitchen table of her 
apartment in downtown New Haven. 
On the table between us, an accordion 
folder bursts with the records of her 
activism: a laminated guide to forms of 
birth control, a flier for a queer cum-
bia dance party, a photocopied dia-
gram titled “aparato reproductor 
femenino útero”—female reproduc-
tive system uterus. A member of the 
Class of 2025, Allis is an Ethnicity, 
Race, and Migration major and a 
full-time healthcare coordinator at 
Integrated Refugee and Immigrant 
Services (IRIS) in New Haven.

With a Google Doc full of 
questions and a half-eaten samosa, 
I nervously shuffle around and drop 
my claw clip on the floor, twice. It’s 
not every day that I ask one of my 
friends if I can turn a conversation 
we would usually have over dinner 
into a formal, on-the-record inter-
view. We decide to start with some-
thing familiar: the class we took 
together last semester.

One day in September, Allis 
walked out of the classroom half-
way through the seminar and didn’t 
return. I remember the flash of her 
yellow beanie disappearing through 
the doorway. When I ask her now 
why she left that day, she tells me 
about how tired she was. Allis was 
overwhelmed, struggling to see the 
point of continuing classes at Yale. 
“Going to school seemed unimport-
ant in the grand scheme of things 
because I was missing my family, my 
community, I was missing my dogs.” 
She missed home.

Home, for Allis, extends beyond 
Laredo, the rural town in South 
Texas where she grew up. When 
she thinks about home, she hears 
the chicharras, the dense whir of the 
cicadas’ song swelling through “the 
smell of wet earth after it rains on a 
hot summer day.” She hears clatters of 
laughter over the cumbia music drift-
ing between the stucco walls of her house 
on Mulberry Street in San Antonio. She 
hears the squeaking of her bike’s ungreased 
wheels as she rides her bike through 
Oakland. “There’s this James Baldwin 
quote . . . I can’t really remember,” she tells 
me. We find it later in her dog-eared copy 
of Giovanni’s Room: “Perhaps home is not 
a place but simply an irrevocable condition.”

For Allis, education is at the center 
remained hers alone. For Allis, the abil-
ity to retain the power of decision-mak-
ing in matters of reproductive healthcare 
defines reproductive justice. In 2013, she 
started advocating for her community in 
San Antonio, Texas. Her work as a doula, 
a community healer, focused on equip-
ping patients with the knowledge they 
need to ensure their consent to medical 
procedures is informed. 

Throughout the two-thousand tens, 
Allis’ activism led her to protests at the 
Texas State Capitol, to the front of 
makeshift classrooms where eager stu-
dents learned how to find their cervixes, 
to the bedside of patients seeking abor-
tions and, eventually, to a class called 
“Education and Empire” at Yale. That’s 
where I met Allis.

Around 11 p.m. one night in 
November 2000, 16-year-old Allis 
Ozornia felt a sharp pain in her 
abdomen. By 8 a.m. the next morning, 
half of her reproductive system had been 
surgically removed.

When Allis first mentioned the pain 
to her mom earlier that day, she 
wasn’t alarmed: “Oh mija, this is 
your period. You’re getting cramps.” 
After Allis fainted, they went to the 
hospital, where “almost everyone 
[she] interacted with” asked if she 
was pregnant. She knew how irrel-
evant the question of pregnancy was 
for her, and she tried to communi-
cate that to the doctors. “I came out 
shortly after my recovery . . . and I 
went full-force lesbian.” 

As her doctor approached her 
with a second pregnancy test and a 
raised eyebrow, Allis also knew that 
“something was wrong.” Looking 
back, Allis now understands that 
the doctor’s refusal to listen reduced 
her medical case to a stereotype 
of Latine people. “To him, I was 
just a pregnant border teen,” Allis 
says. “That was my first experi-
ence in not being heard by medical 
professionals.”

After her pregnancy tests came 
back negative, her doctor found a 
tumor on her right ovary and told 
her that he would perform an emer-
gency hysterectomy. “I was preco-
cious enough to understand that 
this meant that I wasn’t going to be 
able to have babies.” This is when 
the hocicona in Allis kicked in. Her 
mom’s nickname for her, hocicona, 
literally 
translates 
to 
“blabber-
mouth.” Allis explains, “I have opin-
ions and I say them.” Allis insisted 
that she wanted to have children, 
first explaining, then crying, then 
yelling, while her doctor stared 
blankly over his clipboard.

An hour or so later he returned 
with a new plan: they would remove 
only half of her reproductive system. He 
didn’t explain why the surgery was nec-
essary, what would be removed, or what 
steps Allis would need to take to heal. 
She woke up the next day with a “gash 
that ran from the top of [her] vaginal 
wall to [her] belly button.” 

Allis’ advocacy for herself that night 
in the emergency room ensured that the 
decision to have or not have children
