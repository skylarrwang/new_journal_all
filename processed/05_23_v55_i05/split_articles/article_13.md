To Care for a Community
Amistad Catholic Worker runs a house to which anyone can 
come eat, pray, and receive donations. Following the Tent City 
demolition, they also allow unhoused people to camp in the 
backyard. The organization’s mission statement reads: “We 
seek to be a safe haven and a public nonviolent witness in our 
neighborhood, and always try to blur the distinction between 
the people who are serving and those being served.”


“That’s what we’re doing here, and we simply need the 
city to get out of the way and let us show them how to do it,” 
Colville emphasized.


At COMPASS, crisis response occurs only after police refer-
ral, generating a major departure from Colville’s model. Yet 
organization that works alongside police and city government.


“What I saw [during the Tent City clearing] was peo-
ple from COMPASS accompanied by police in uniform and 
with guns. So to me, that sort of invalidates the whole thing,” 
Colville explained to me over the phone.


Colville’s model of community care is different from 
COMPASS’s, as he lives in a home directly alongside those he 
works with, including the former residents of Tent City. This 
generates a horizontal model of care in which neighbors help 
neighbors—without necessitating the involvement of police. 
People who are unhoused from all over the state come 
to The Hill, Colville says, because “we take care of our own.”

there are aspects of COMPASS that do resemble forms of hor-
izontal community care, such as the involvement of peers on 
their response teams. Two people from COMPASS respond to 
crisis calls: a licensed clinician and a peer recovery specialist 
who has experienced homelessness and/or substance use. 
Between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., each two-person COMPASS 
team can respond to a call in an average of thirteen minutes. 
When they do, COMPASS peer recovery specialist Nanette 
Campbell told me over the phone, the clinician will often take 
the immediate lead on crisis response, while the peer is there to 
relate to those in crisis and approach them in a more accessible 
manner than police or clinicians may be able to do. 
Campbell is the primary peer on the COMPASS team and 
has been working in the field of peer crisis response for twenty 
years. She emphasized the importance of having a peer respond 
to a crisis, rather than just a clinician or an armed force:


“It’s just different walks of life, and [police] don’t know 
what we know as far as mental health issues, substance issues,” 
Campbell told me, exhaustion in her voice at the end of her 
work day. “Me myself, I’ve lived that life. So just knowing about 
different things and what people are going through and meet-
ing them where they are.”


COMPASS also does proactive outreach to areas that it 
deems crisis hotspots: “where there are drug overdoses, folks 
who look like they’re in need, folks who may be congregating 
during cold winter weather and may need to get to a warming 
center,” Tebes explained. During these outreach sessions, the 
two-person team distributes care packages and can respond 
if they see someone in distress. These efforts tend to be con-
centrated on the New Haven Green, along a stretch of Ella T. 
Grasso Boulevard in the Edgewood and West River neighbor-
hoods, and at the end of the Boulevard south of The Hill. All 
are majority BIPOC and low-income neighborhoods with the 
exception of the Green, where demographics are affected by its 
close proximity to Yale.


COMPASS conducts its outreach without any police presence. 
Yet Colville feels like the ongoing partnership with police—
especially given that it is the only way the group responds to 
crisis calls—keeps COMPASS from being able to help in areas 
that do not want a police presence.


“I doubt that anyone on my block, except for me, is really 
aware that [COMPASS] is a thing,” Colville told me with a sigh. 
“That’s fine, you know, it’s in its infancy. But in this neighbor-
hood . . . we have a standing policy here, we don’t call the police. 
So who knows if we will ever see [COMPASS].”


Both Tebes and Labieniec made it clear that this second-
ary response phase is temporary, and that there are plans for 
COMPASS to independently respond to crisis calls as soon as this 
summer. However, COMPASS would still remain a part of the 911 
system. Tebes explained that Public Safety Answering Points 
(PSAP), which runs the 911 dispatch, would direct relevant 911 
calls to COMPASS rather than uniformed police. In order to 
reach that point, however, COMPASS must collect enough data 
to understand where it would succeed as a solo actor, and with 
that data, draw up a standard to be used by 911 dispatchers. 
This data comes with time, and the more COMPASS referrals 
that come from police and fire officials, the more useful this 
data can become.


“In New Haven, it was always planned that COMPASS would 
grow into that [independent role],” Labieniec said. But that 
process takes time. Labieniec has traveled and met with leaders 
from Colorado and Iowa’s statewide non-police crisis response 
systems. And in both cases, “it was a process” to become disen-
tangled from their existing police systems. 


“If you’re not in it, you don’t realize how complicated it is,” 
Labieniec said.


On a later call, I asked him if he was concerned that the 
current phase of police partnership might alienate communi-
ties like Colville’s in The Hill. He responded that it would be 
impossible to get this project off the ground without collabo-
rating with police. In order to help those in crisis, he believes 
the project needs to begin—even if it starts with the police.


“I don’t think you can effectively do what everyone is seek-
ing for us to do without collaborating at some extent with 
everyone. And I think that includes the police,” Labieniec said 
emphatically. “If we don’t have positive relationships with the 
police and with the city and with everyone, we’re not going to 
be as successful for the people that actually need the help.”


Labieniec and Campbell both expressed to me their belief 
in the ways that COMPASS has helped, and will continue to 
help, people on the individual level. Campbell described a 
woman who refers to the team as “her saving angels” after they 
helped her get clean. Labieniec pointed me to a New Haven 
Independent story about a woman who COMPASS helped safely 
relocate off the street.


But COMPASS is not just the two-person response team, nor 
the house in Dwight. It is also an experiment in policing alter-
natives that is continuously debated in City Hall and litigated 
by Yale and city lawyers. And at that macro level, some activ-
ists have begun to grow concerned—even those looking past 
police presence.

UNDER THE SHADOW OF YALE AND THE CITY
B
ehind COMPASS’s slow, methodical, and data-driven 
approach to policing alternatives—an approach that frus-
trates more radical, anti-police advocates like Colville—is Yale 
and the New Haven government. 
Last spring, Yale quietly became a driving force behind 
the COMPASS project. A publicly available, 36-page contract 
between Yale and the city shows that, in exchange for over $3.5 
million in funding, Yale agreed to set up and run COMPASS for 
at least three years. More specifically, The Consultation Center 
at Yale University, which Tebes runs, would subcontract with 
Continuum of Care to launch the COMPASS team, and would 
then be able to collect data from the initiative for research pur-
poses. This data includes COMPASS’s clients’ demographics like 
race, ethnicity, gender identity, and income—all of which Yale 
collects and shares with New Haven.


The Consultation Center has, for the last forty years, 
researched best practices for mental health crisis interven-
tion, according to a video on the center’s website. The cen-
ter partners with external organizations or bases projects off 
of affiliated faculties’ needs. One of these projects included 
running a culture and diversity training for the New Haven 
Police Department.


According to Tebes, Yale has made in-kind contributions, 
such as new hires and equipment, that will amount to up to
