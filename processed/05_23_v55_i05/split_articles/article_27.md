It’s March again
I keep my window open when I’m afraid to go outside. 
But the weather’s been good—warm and honest, in that when 
one day is seventy degrees, the next few are too. And I like this, 
the idea of going out, knowing what to expect, and getting 
what I want.
I have also been dishonest. Dishonest, in that I believe 
I will want to go outside and feel the first breeze of the year 
and see everybody I know. I’ll step out of my dorm and open 
its big iron gate with the full lean of my all body weight. The 
sounds of College Street traffic will truck me, roaring muffler-
removed beater cars, horns, motorbikes, sirens, and some 
pounding, bass-boosted song I remember from online. 
I will walk to Cross Campus, because everybody I know 
would too. And it will be just as I imagine: everybody I know, all 
at once. I sit with this part the longest. I keep my window open.
