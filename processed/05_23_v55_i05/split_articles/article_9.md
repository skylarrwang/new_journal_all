roleplay as adventurers of their own cre-
ation, banding together to take on a jour-
ney spun by the DM. Fantastic explains 
that during gameplay at ECG, general 
swearing is okay but casual homopho-
bia, misogyny, or any hate speech is “like 
super not cool.” Fantastic continues, 
“Really it’s about having fun . . . We want 
people that are excited to share their 
love of DnD with new people.” They 
emphasize that “welcoming players of 
all backgrounds is a big priority to the 
organizers.”


In this spirit, ECG organizes the 
Elm City Adventure Squad, a begin-
ner friendly, in-house program for DnD. 
Though Luke Mastalli-Kelly, software 
engineer by day and DM by night, is no 
stranger to running campaigns, he admits 
that there’s a lot more consideration that 
goes into programming a session for ECG 
than for the typical DnD campaign. “It 
needs to be inclusive in a wide vari-
ety of ways,” Mastalli-Kelly writes over 
Discord message. “I’ve [run DnD] games 
for everyone—from a kid who hadn’t 
played much DnD and mostly wanted 
to fish, to folks who have been playing 
since the very first editions of the game 
and are focused adventurers.” It strikes 
me how thoughtful Mastalli-Kelly has to 
be to include everyone in the game. For 
the fishing-obsessed kid, he had to find 
a way to have fishing advance the plot: 
“I think he eventually caught a fish that 
was grabbed by one of the Sahuagin [or 
a half-man, half-sea creature monster] 
stalking the boat. Gave him a unique rea-
son to care about the threat!” 


I couldn’t help but think back to the 
groups of friends I had seen through a 
window that very first time I happened 
by in one of the game rooms. Mastalli-
Kelly and his fiancée had gotten involved 
with game nights almost as soon as they 
moved to New Haven in January 2020. 
He also hosts a separate DnD game 
night, spun out of friends he made from 
previous Elm City Adventure Squad 
games: “That’s how I actually met folks 
who turned out to be neighbors in my 
little apartment complex before I moved 
into a house.”


At this point, I was itching to join a 
game night at ECG. As luck would have it, 
a spot had opened up with the Elm City 
Adventure Squad. For my very first foray, 
I revived a character I had imagined 
from my 13-year-old fanfiction days: 
Kat—a hot, emo, dark magic-wielding, 
half-demon type of few words (offi-
cially, I was a Tiefling Warlock). Kat was 
joined by Mockwind, a grouchy, mon-
ey-chasing warlock; Garuda, an aloof, 
novel-writing Owlin Sorlock (a half-
owl humanoid of a mixed class combin-
ing sorcerers and warlocks); Damion, a 
brooding hero-type fighter; Ranger, a 
bumbling Barbarian Dwarf with the 
catchphrase “It’s Dwarfing Time!”; and 
Dax, a pint-sized Fairy Ranger who 
doubles as a sheriff with an on-and-off 
Southern drawl. Snee, our ventrilo-
quist Dungeon Master, led us through 
a storyline of his own creation—we six 
adventurers had been hired to take out 
a kobold infestation that was terrorizing 
a town. 


We marched through with Damion 
and Dax at the helm, who had a good 
cop, bad cop schtick going. The others 
spewed out catchphrases in character 
(sound effects included) as I lucked out 
by roleplaying with sparse words. Over 
the course of the four-hour session, the 
guys chipped away at my introversion. 
Roman, a retiree who commandeered 
Ranger the Dwarf, won me over with 
packs of M&Ms. As we looted the corpse 
of a champion we’d defeated, Terry 
interrupted, “We should let the newbies 
have first pick.” Michael had picked up 
a powerful magic item—the Wand of 
Fish Magic. In a gruff voice, Michael 
presented the wand to me: “To congrat-
ulate the youngin’ on her first adventure.” 
Andrew, who had been explaining the 
game to me, smiled kindly: “It does a lot 
of damage for a level one character.” 


The Wand of Fish Magic proved to 
be quite pivotal. The final boss, a Kobold 
King backed by a wizard, had effort-
lessly thwarted my fellow adventurers’ 
attacks until it became my turn. For the 
first spell I would ever cast, I was ready 
to bring out the big guns. Under my 
breath, I announced my plan: “I wanna 
nuke ‘em.” Everyone pooled together 
dice for me to roll. It added up to twen-
ty-two, more than enough to end the 
Kobold King in one blow. Snee grinned 
at me: “How do you wanna do this?” I 
described what came to mind: clutch-
ing the wand with both arms, I (as Kat) 
fired a giant orb of magic straight into 
the Kobold King, completely eviscerat-
ing him from the face of the earth upon 
contact. Complete K.O. The table reacted 
gleefully, perhaps with a tinge of pride, at 
the newcomer who dealt the finishing 
blow on the tough boss. Afterward, I got 
to keep the wand in Kat’s inventory, a 
token of triumph. 


In the seven years since opening, 
the ECG community has been a revolv-
ing door. Fantastic explains: “We have 
some people that think they’re coming 
here temporarily and ended up staying a 
long time and other people who are here 
from the start of the first semester and 
then, two days after graduation, they’re 
gone. We see people that come to visit 
again, [although] they may have moved 
away three years ago.” 


Though Brenda lives a town over 
and can’t drive, she makes it a point to 
visit the store whenever she can. “I’ve 
tried to duck back in because finding 
a truly safe and accepting place in the 
gaming community—or in life in gen-
eral—is hard as hell for me sometimes.” 
For her, and for quite a few other regu-
lars who commute from out of town, the 
inclusivity at ECG is worth it. 


Come May, I’ll be moving out of 
New Haven. I might not see the guys I 
played my very first game of DnD with 
again (Michael, Andrew, Terry, Roman, 
Patrick, and Snee), but we’ve formed 
a Discord thread named Kobold Cave. 
I like the idea that I’m still tethered to 
them in some way, and that the Kobold 
Cave we surmounted lingers somewhere 
out there, no matter what. 


As we wrap up our conversation on 
a quiet Sunday afternoon, Fantastic has 
to leave and greet their guests—friends 
from a now-defunct gaming conven-
tion, coming to catch up over a round of 
games. “We’re a social club built around 
games,” Fantastic grins as we walk out, 
“[but we’re] community first.” ∎
