‘ōlelo7—the completion of October’s 
repatriation is indebted to the teachings 
of cultural practitioners Mana Caceres, 
Kalehua Caceres, and Halealoha Ayau.

It is the day before repatriation, 
and I am the only customer in Atticus 
Bookstore Cafe. I trade out my anno-
tated copy of Aeschylus’ Oresteia for the 
twelve pages of repatriation cultural pro-
tocol that I need to have pa‘a8 in a matter 
of hours. Though a plurality of identity is 
stitched into my seams, it threads the dis-
tance within myself. Every line of Greek 
tragedy I read spins a web between New 
Haven and Hawai‘i, and every missed 
diacritical and mispronounced word in 
‘ōlelo Hawai‘i bares my entanglement. 
I mouth Pule Ikaika—the first prayer 
of the ceremony, which asks for the 
strength of our ancestors to support the 
work of repatriation—in a hushed voice, 
like a secret. E ho‘ōla iā mākou i nā mea 
Hawai‘i kūpono / E ho‘āla iā mākou i ka 
na‘au pono no kēia hana / E ho‘ohui iā 
mākou i ho‘okahi mana‘o. Grant life to 
us in the true Hawaiian sense / Awaken 
within us the true depth of this work / 
Allow us to become one in mind.

The irony is not lost on me. Plurality 
is self-canceling. Plurality is paradoxi-
cally alienating.

I am silent, but returning to my cor-
roded mother tongue provokes sobs that 
can be heard from Hawai‘i. I am the 
words I don’t speak. I am the memories 
of home I don’t remember. I am the log-
ical gaps of my freshman year philosophy, 
yearning for a satiating ontological proof 
in a college whose history is antithetical 
to my own existence. I am the negative 
space of my lineage, lost somewhere 
between my future and past.

The morning of the ceremony, I 
dress in all black. Josh and I eat break-
fast together in silence. We meet Kala‘i 
and Professor Hobart. There is not much 
said between us kanaka maoli, but I 
know we are together. The outside is 
bright, and the inside is dark. We enter 
the room at the Peabody West Campus 
where the iwi are housed. All the lights 
are off. The day is young, and the room is 
ageless. Kala‘i immediately flicks pī kai9 
containing ‘olena1⁰ sea salt from Hawai‘i 
onto us and all. Drops of home trickle 
down my forehead. We begin. Kala‘i and 
Josh together cut the cloth that will be 
wrapped around the iwi to keep them in 
Pō11. We recite the oli and anchor pule. 
We recite our individual mo‘okū‘au-
hau to tell the iwi kūpuna whom we 
come from. Josh and Kala‘i take inven-
tory of the iwi kūpuna, and there is an 
error. Inconsistent labeling. But because 
we are all together, we are calm and we 
continue. Kala‘i and Josh together clarify 
the error with the Peabody staff. They, 
together, wrap the iwi. Kala‘i flicks pī kai 
again onto us and all that surrounds us to 
cleanse the space. We leave together as 
one, iwi in hand.

From New Haven, we drive to 
Poughkeepsie, New York, inbound to 
Vassar College. There, we will perform 
the repatriation ceremony again with 
Halealoha Ayau and another kanaka 
maoli student, so they can return the 
iwi back to Hawai‘i. In the backseat of 
the van, I try to imagine the iwi kūpuna. 
Restless in a small city called New 
Haven, an ocean away from home, they 
were here centuries before I could even 
fathom my existence in the Northeast. 
Their remains are also in Vassar College. 
And in Harvard University, Dartmouth 
College, the Smithsonian Museum, 
and more institutions spanning conti-
nents. It is only my sixth week at Yale 
University, and the iwi kūpuna, a devas-
tating testament to my institution’s colo-
nial history, are tightly strapped in a seat 
belt next to me.

And for the rest of fall semester, I 
struggle to commit to that world. The 
tragedy that repatriation was predicated 
upon permeates my consciousness, alien-
ating me from academic work at Yale. 
Reading the Western canon has become 
a dispossession of identity, but on a 
rare November afternoon, I read Ovid’s 
Metamorphoses on a bench overlook-
ing Science Hill until I can no longer 
see the pages. Mortal Hyacinthus dies 
to Apollo’s discus like a broken flower, 
his head snapped down so he faces the 
earth—it is through the nature of his 
death that the namesake flower emerges. 
A name immortalizes death, what’s more, 
a story: Ovid writes, “a valiant hero shall 
be known by the same marks upon its 
petals.” In complete darkness, my feet 
crunch the dead leaves below. The great 
are buried, and their afterlife of great-
ness buries what’s native. Here in New 
Haven, all of my heroes are fading, and 
I do not know how to forgive myself for 
my complicity.

In my literature seminar the fol-
lowing morning, Assistant Professor 
of Classics Erika Valdivieso explains 
how burials in the epic tradition mark 
privilege. The burial of Hyacinthus, like 
many others in Virgil’s Aeneid, memo-
rializes male heroes in place. Even the 
exceptional female warrior Camila in the 
Aeneid is bereft of this memorialization 
in place. Professor Valdivieso cites an 
article by Dr. Georgia Nugent entitled 
“The Women of the Aeneid–Vanishing 
Bodies, Disappearing Voices” and points, 
“Where do the bodies of women go?” 
This is a question that exists beyond epic 
myth, an unresolved reality for which 
marginalized communities demand an 
answer from the world.


Instead of our usual fall semester 
morning seminars, it is a spring after-
noon—a new sunlight is upon us in 
the Humanities Quadrangle courtyard. 
Professor Valdivieso and I discuss ways 
to read the epic tradition resistantly, an 
empowering mode of literary reception 
that her academic career in the classics 
and colonial early Americas has inspired 
me to uphold. A text’s longevity doesn’t 
come from language, but rather its recep-
tion: “close reading allows you to see the 
sutures, the slips, the bumps, in the fabric 
of texts,” she tells me, “ . . . you as a reader, 
work to unstitch the ideological proj-
ects of texts.” Reinterpretation brightens 
what greatness has shadowed—even in 
the dark, one can still imagine. 
For what is absence if not a search for 
relationality, loss if not a presence of duty?

The vanishing bodies of women in 
the Roman epic remind me of the rea-
sons for repatriation—to unstitch and 
restitch the narratives of marginalized 
communities that history has failed in 
doing––and I hear Pule Nā Kūpuna12 
echoing back. Na mākou e mālama i nā 
iwi o ko mākou kūpuna / Na nā mo‘o e 
mālama i ko mākou iwi / A ho‘omau ka 
lōkahi o kākou no laila / E hō mai ka‘ike. 
We will protect the bones of our ancestors 
/ And our children will protect our bones / 
As we continue this interdependency, thus / 
Grant us knowledge. Unlike close reading, 
however, unstitching history is predicated 
upon community. Restitching his-
tory is predicated upon a generation.

For who are kanaka maoli today, 
if not a rope of lineage, realizing our 
future together is intertwined with our 
predecessors?

Interdependency is a continuum, 
and it is this powerful Indigenous rela-
tionality that heals. It has sustained my 
vitality at Yale and has been my proof 
of existence. In the parking lot of the 
Peabody Museum’s West Campus, Kala‘i 
ties my kīhei13 tightly before the repa-
triation ceremony. At the end of the 
ceremony, the six of us kanaka maoli 
share two bowls of fresh ‘ahi1⁴ and rice 
on the floors of Vassar College in relief. 
A month later, Josh and I race to the 
shore at Lighthouse Point Park, our bare, 
shriveled palms touching sand for the 
first time since leaving Hawai‘i. Another 
month later, he strums my ‘ukulele in my 
suite, and we sing into the winter night 
until it no longer tastes bitter. When 
New Haven freezes over at the start of 
February, Professor Hobart hosts Pacific 
Islander students in her apartment, and 
together, we eat her homemade saimin 
on a roundtable. In this transitory period 
that is college, I measure my life in these 
beautiful moments of interdependence, 
because they point homeward.

For myself and other kanaka maoli 
at Yale, this recognition of interdepen-
dency as essential to ourselves began 
with repatriation. Six months after the 
repatriation ceremony, Josh and I are 
alone in the Stiles Buttery on an April 
night. We ruminate here often together. 
“Repatriation,” he says, “in a very sur-
face level sense, is the definition itself 
of giving and helping out without any 
expectation of receiving because there 
is no physical way to receive something 
when it is returning the dead.” Though 
now relieved from repatriation’s distress, 
recovering these memories is cathartic, 
and he believes it will always be. 
“Despite being a culture and a peo-
ple who have experienced so much loss, 
losing those relations to each other 
through all of the history Hawaiians 
have had to endure, it is that ground-
ing in our responsibilities to each other 
that have kept us going,” Josh tells me. 
Repatriation has blessed me with a 
beloved friend whose soul is native soil, 
and whose voice replenishes it.

And I am most replenished in the 
presence of my Native heroes. In an 
academic panel hosted by New York 
University’s Asian Pacific American 
Institute that I attended during spring 
break, Dr. Mary Tuti Baker prefaced her 
segment by asking the audience to tell 
their neighbor whose spirit they have 
brought with them to the panel. I tell the 
unfamiliar NYU student next to me that 
the spirit of my deceased great-grand-
mother Leina‘ala Poepoe is with me, the 
oldest relative in my mo‘okū‘auhau with 
koko Hawai‘i1⁵ I knew and will ever 
know in my lifetime.

She 
has 
followed 
me 
across 
Moananuiākea1⁶, across state lines, and 
subway lines she had never crossed. Her 
spirit was with me during the repatria-
tion ceremony, in the car ride watching 
over my shoulders as the iwi kūpuna are 
beside me, finally in Pō. When I was 
three years old, she held my hand as we 
walked through her garden on the lush 
mountains of Puna, Hawai‘i. Fifteen 
years later, I reach out for her palms in 
the withering autumn. I do not know 
what the iwi kūpuna look like, but she 
eases my imagination.

Despite my authorial attempts, any 
image of the iwi kūpuna is four times 
removed—once by colonial disposses-
sion; twice by the osteological work of 
the Yale Peabody Museum that sterilized 
and shelved the iwi away from history; 
a third time by the dialogue between 
Professor Hobart, Josh, and Kala‘i, who 
all saw or handled the plasticized iwi, 
and myself who had not; and a fourth 
by my own language in this piece to 
you, the reader. In spite of—or precisely 
because of—this chasm that separates 
our existence from our history, there is a 
demand for us to imagine.

Through imagining my iwi kūpuna, 
my way of knowing is no longer linear, 
but circular.

My backbone is no longer rigid, 
but spiral. My selfhood is no longer a 
stitched thread, but a woven rope. And 
the ending is no longer a burial, but 
a revival. ∎

producing a view of time that is spiral rather than linear. 
Within Pō, time and space are not necessarily discrete categories.”
