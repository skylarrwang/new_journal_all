EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At the start of the Spring 2022 
semester, K. was sexually assaulted. 
They can’t recount everything that hap-
pened that night, due to the impacts of 
alcohol and post-traumatic stress disorder, 
but they remember meeting an older student from a 
campus club they were in at a fraternity party. They 
talked. It was suggestive. The two went back to his 
room. They weren’t in the right state of being to con-
sent—and they didn’t consent.

K. had also just started their new job on cam-
pus. As a Communication and Consent Educator 
(CCE), they’d spend the rest of the semester attend-
ing trainings hosted by institutions like Title IX, 
planning events to educate students about sex-
ual misconduct, and flipping through readings in 
preparation for weekly CCE meetings—all in the 
hopes of creating a healthier social and sexual cul-
ture at Yale. After they were raped in high school, K. 
spent years working to build more supportive struc-
tures for survivors of sexual assault at their school 
and local community. The opportunity to continue 
this with Yale’s CCE program was a large factor in 
their decision to enroll. 

Specifically, K. kept working to make Yale a 
more comfortable environment for survivors of 
sexual violence with the CCE Survivor Support 
team, one of four “project groups” that CCEs serve in 
alongside their respective residential colleges. 

Despite their time learning about and educat-
ing others on sexual misconduct as a CCE, they had 
trouble recognizing their own experience of sexual 
assault. They’d only begun processing the events of 
that night several months later on a summer trip 
to Europe—when they weren’t “CCE-ing,” they told 
me. Although they’d started to come to terms with 
their experience that summer, they tried to keep 
their trauma out of sight and out of mind come fall 
semester, avoiding thinking or speaking about it.

Editor’s note: K. requested that their identity be 
anonymized due to the sensitivity of their story.


In retrospect, K. asked: “Why do I not give 
myself the same care and concern as I would give 
literally any of my friends . . . especially as some-
one who is paid to talk about these kinds of things 
with people?”


The CCE program emerged partly in response 
to widespread scrutiny of Yale’s sexual climate 
both on and off campus. The program signaled 
an accountability shift inwards—toward a peer-to-
peer system managing sexual misconduct and away 
from the more bare bones administrative Title IX 
procedures.

Melanie Boyd, Yale College Dean of Student 
Affairs, helped launch the program in August 
2011, about four months after the Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) began 
investigating Yale for violating Title IX rules. The 
headline-making Title IX complaint, raised by a 
group of sixteen Yale students and alumni, alleged 
that the University fostered a hostile sexual climate 
and mishandled several cases of misconduct in 
recent years. 

The complaint highlighted several campus 
events, many of which remain infamous at Yale 
more than a decade later. In 2008, Zeta Psi pledges 
held a sign reading “We love Yale sluts!” outside of 
the Women’s Center. In 2009, male students circu-
lated the “preseason scouting report,” a mass email 
ranking dozens of female first-years by how many 
beers it would take to sleep with them. And in 
October 2010, pledges of the Delta Kappa Epsilon 
fraternity (DKE) marched around Old Campus 
chanting “No means yes, yes means anal!” and other 
misogynistic remarks.

The day after the 2010 DKE incident, Boyd’s 
Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) 
seminar “Theorizing Sexual Violence” met at 
their usual time and place at the Hall of Graduate 
Studies, which is now the Humanities Quandrangle. 
But instead of discussing the week’s scheduled cur-
riculum, the Yale Daily News reported, Boyd urged 
students to reflect on a “script-breaking response” 
to campus sexual violence and imagine communi-
ty-oriented ways to respond to such incidents. 

Later that year, the University’s Task Force 
on Sexual Misconduct Education and Prevention, 
composed of Yale faculty, convened in response to 
the DKE incident. They released a report recom-
mending that Yale “expand the pool of well-sup-
ported, well-educated student educators” and “raise 
the level of student knowledge through mandatory 
educational programs,” among other ideas. While 
the CCE program began to take shape, Yale adopted 
a flurry of other sexual misconduct response pro-
grams, including the University-Wide Committee 
on Sexual Misconduct (UWC), which investigates 
and adjudicates sexual misconduct cases.

A proposed CCE program, according to Interim 
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Director of 
the Office of Gender and Campus Culture (OGCC) 
Eilaf Elmileik, “grew out of ” Boyd’s WGSS seminar 
in the fall of 2020. Though the News reported that 
the seminar discussed the DKE incident and that 
the program came amid the flurry of Yale’s respon-
sive actions, Elmileik denied connection to the 
public uproar.

The first class of CCEs trained for their new roles 
in the summer of 2011. They held their inaugural 
first-year orientation workshops that fall.

“These are difficult issues and require frank, 
thoughtful conversations—the kind of discussions 
students are often most willing to have with other 
students,” Boyd stated in a News article when the 
CCE program first kicked off. 

Today, the student-led CCE program, which 
the OGCC oversees, stands unique among other 
sexual misconduct education and support systems 
at Yale. More than fifty undergraduates, distrib-
uted throughout all fourteen residential colleges 
and diverse areas of student life, serve as CCEs. In 
an effort to change the campus’ social and sex-
ual climate as a whole, they hold “interventions,” 
including informal conversations and more for-
mal workshops, like the mandatory Bystander 
Intervention training for first-years. 

Deputy Title IX Coordinator Katie Shirley 
wrote to me that the Title IX office provides “guid-
ance” on the primary content of CCE workshops. 
But it is typically fellow undergraduates that are 
responsible for educating their peers on how to pre-
vent sexual violence themselves—despite the heavy 
topics at hand and the complex web of sexual mis-
conduct policies and response systems at Yale. The 
University’s professionally staffed programs like 
Title IX and the Sexual Harassment and Assault 
Response & Education center (SHARE), which 
provides crisis support, counseling, and health and 
wellness care referrals for survivors, take a more 
indirect role in outreach.

Title IX offers its own customizable workshops 
and training for campus organizations that request 
them, according to its website. Shirley did not 
address my inquiry into what Title IX’s own train-
ing looks or whether these are mandatory for stu-
dents on their own. CCE Zoe Kanga ’24, who is on 
the Title IX Student Advisory Committee, told me 
that there are opportunities for students to speak 
directly with the Title IX office about sexual mis-
conduct at Yale, but that these opportunities aren’t 
well advertised beyond CCEs’ workshops with first-
year students. 

“We do, of course, advertise those resources 
during our interventions. But I think after that it 
kind of falls out,” Kanga said. “And I doubt that 
anyone in their junior year after experiencing some-
thing is going to go dig through their archives and 
find that one slip of paper that they received in their 
CCE training first year.”

In her email to me, Shirley only described 
opportunities for student leaders employed by 
Yale—including CCEs, First-Year Counselors, Peer 
Liaisons, and Transfer Peer Advisors—to speak with 
her during open office hours. She added that she is 
available to meet with CCEs one-on-one if they are 
interested in speaking about a particular area of the 


As their fall semester back to campus con-
tinued, K. couldn’t control the visceral reaction 
they felt when they saw their assailant in spaces 
they once felt safe in. Right before Thanksgiving 
break, they began speaking with Shirley, whom they 
were familiar with through CCE training, to secure a 
no-contact agreement between themselves and their 
assailant. They’d learned a little about no-contact 
measures through CCE training, but the intricacies of 
the process were still unclear. 

Initially, K. believed that visiting the Title IX 
office would fix all of their problems. As a CCE, they 
directed people to the office all the time. But as they 
sat across from Shirley at each meeting, tackling the 
logistics of academic accommodations and social 
arrangement conditions in the new no-contact 
agreement, K. gradually understood they weren’t 
going to receive the emotional relief they needed. 

Title IX’s supportive measures—and all of their 
limits—are laid out to CCEs during training and 
made accessible on the office’s website. Shirley and 
most Title IX administrators aren’t trained as thera-
pists. Despite this, K. came into the process expect-
ing more support than logistical accommodations. 
They’d ultimately walk away emotionally unsatisfied, 
even though they’d later describe their experience 
in itself as “neutral.”

When students come to CCEs with disclosures 
of sexual misconduct, CCEs respond with a script 
designed by the OGCC. Usually, the CCE begins by 
informing the survivor that they are an educator, 
not a counselor. They emphasize that they’re avail-
able as support, but they aren’t trained to give advice 
or to offer solutions themselves. As someone talks 
through their experience, CCEs make sure to mimic 
their language as part of the motivational inter-
viewing method, which prioritizes guiding students 
toward their own conclusions on their experiences. 
During each conversation, the CCE presents the 
array of resources on campus available to students 
who state they have experienced sexual miscon-
duct. If you’re looking for something like emotional 
counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy, SHARE 
may be the way to go. If you need to move rooms 
to distance yourself from your assailant, or even 
an ex, Title IX can help arrange accommodations. 
And if you want to hold your assailant accountable 
through disciplinary consequences, you can book 
a consultation with the UWC. But the process may 
be lengthy. 

As mandatory reporters, CCEs inform their 
OGCC supervisors of all disclosures, which are then 
reported to Title IX. Shirley then sends the survivor 
an email with resources and opportunities to fol-
low up with the office, which they may or may not 
respond to.

As they navigated their own process, being a 
CCE made K. feel “helped and not helped.” From 

“We have a tendency  to 
over-intellectualize our 
experiences in a way that 
can be challenging to give 
enough space for the human, 
personal elements of those 
experiences,” K. explained. 
“I have all this hefty consent-
based vocabulary that I can 
use in an academic context. 
But where does that leave 
space for my rage, and my 
pain, and my sadness?”
