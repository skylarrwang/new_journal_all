Each blueberry broke its thin shell
and bled, turning the whole pancake sick.
I tossed it, tried again, facing the window
With an egg-blue frame that revealed
The sea silently breaking and the boys
Tossing a navy object, squirming in the air like a fish.
I called them boys though we were the same
age. In the private sphere I was a woman;
In public, a girl. Meaning I was
Both trusted and instructed to make breakfast.
I held the bowl with both hands
And poured the dough into the pan.
Blue floor, blue fan, blue air around the blue
Walls with the blue lesion showing
The blue sea and sky—the entire room
Covered in expectations for me
Like the light of radiation whose hue
Eclipses everything, even its own name.

After “Giverny” by Ian Pople
Summer pollen settled
on the taupe plywood fence you leaned over
to pet the neighbors’ full-grown
pig, its belly dragging the ground in the yard
covered with rusted toys and inflatable pools. You stained your 
best white swimsuit.
Then, through the pale pink
and green of the pier, we saw the umbrellas
in yellow stripes and the rainbow candyfloss ones, all in front of 
the mural
of a woman looking at the ocean 
through a telescope, the sides
of the telescope painted grey 
and flat because
the glass, the reflection, the clarity,
was complicated, and so the patch was painted
over and repainted several times, to perfect 
the mistake, and so the woman was looking
at nothing at all, except her own face— round 
like a full moon over the Gulf,
but mostly blank. You declared the mural
super, remarkable, then sprinted into the Atlantic,
grinning as you showed me a discarded styrofoam cup you 
found in the waves, as if it was (?) a trophy.
I feel like this is an important detail.
That night we ate linguini on the porch
during a summer thunderstorm, and you were laughing while 
branches were falling
in the backyard, covering moss green spots 
with grey flashes, and I was looking at you
as if I was peering through that woman’s 
telescope, a telescope warped
by the girls who had held it, who had sung of its sight, who had 
sung of brief love in the summer.
