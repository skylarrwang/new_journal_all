“You can’t be in your 
neighborhood without the 
police being there and can’t 
be at school either,” Jamila 
Washington, 
a 
20-year-old 
community organizer for City-
wide, told me. “So, where’s your 
safe place?” 

Seven years ago, Washing-
ton started organizing with 
Citywide after being invited by 
a friend to join Citywide’s “Dinner and 
Dialogue,” a program where New Haven 
residents have round table discussions 
about social issues over a meal. She told me 
she joined Citywide as a “socially anxious” 
NHPS student, but as we talked and joked, I 
could see the joyful and confident 20-year-
old community organizer she’d grown to 
be. 

Washington doesn’t support SROs 
in schools due to her lived experiences 
in NHPS, but her distrust in the system 
builds upon a growing body of informa-
tion. Research by Connecticut Voices 
for Children demonstrates that SROs do 
not make schools measurably safer or 
improve academic outcomes, but their 
presence does greatly increase the number 
of students arrested each school year—
feeding the school-to-prison pipeline. In 
the 2018 to 2019 school year, Black and 
Latine students were three times and one 
point six times more likely, respectively, to 
be arrested than their white counterparts. 
The average percentage of Black students 
arrested in schools with SROs present was 
over seventeen percent higher than those 
without SROs. In this sense, SROs seem to 
be more adept in criminalizing  students—
the main demographic of NHPS—than 
creating a safer school.


Even then, the NHPD is no stranger to 
such brutality, employing officers like those 
who left Randy Cox paralyzed in June 2022 
and tackled Shawn Marshall, a bipolar 
man, during a manic episode in January 
2021. This danger extends to SROs, employ-
ees in the same system. Upon a simple 
Google search, I found an Instagram pro-
motional video from my SRO urging peo-
ple to become good leaders for the New 
Haven youth. But the link before it was an 
article about a New Haven police officer 
who assaulted a man at a Fairfield bar. A 
mixture of shock and discomfort contorted 
my face as I confirmed that the police offi-
cer charged with this violent encounter was 
the same one who roamed our hallways. I 
found it almost dystopian to see this dual-
ity play out side-by-side online. There have 
been too many instances in which police 
officers have been unnecessarily aggres-
sive for me to find it possible to connect 
with them. 

Washington works alongside Alyssa 
Marie Cajigas, a director of the Citywide 
Youth Coalition. Cajigas is an NHPS 
alumna who has since dedicated her time 
to community organizing with Citywide. 
As she chats with me enthusiastically about 
the work Citywide continues to do, her 
love for the NHPS community is evident. 
“We believe that violence should never 
be the answer,” Cajigas told me, “and 
police should never be the first resort for 
discipline in schools.” She explained how 
police were called to address nonviolent 
situations such as a class interruption, 
which could easily be mended with proper 
social support.


A 
dual 
enrollment 
student 
at 
Hillhouse High School and Yale, Elsa 
Holahan, echoed Cajigas’s worries 
about policing. Perhaps she owes 
her conviction to her mother, who 
is a social worker, or to her own 
belief in schools where students “feel 
heard and create their most authen-
tic self.” Regardless, Holahan chose 
to walk out to the Citywide’s protest 
last May. 

“There are power dynamics 
and it disrupts trust,” Holahan said 
about SROs before referring to the 
broader police system. “Students 
have had negative experiences 
and trauma.” 

Holahan’s words remind me of 
Washington’s story about a teacher 
at her school would threaten to call 
SROs against the typecasted “bad” 
students—including 
those 
who 
skipped class often—to get them to 
“behave.” Holahan is adamant about 
the removal of SROs from Hillhouse. 
After seeing the police cars parked 
outside and knowing there are stu-
dents who have had negative experi-
ences with the gun-wielding SRO, Holahan 
finds it impossible to ever develop any 
relationship with SROs. After all, there is 
no police officer roaming the hallways 
of the Humanities Quadrangle at Yale—
another place where Holahan attends class. 
I couldn’t help but chuckle at her joke that 
SROs are “glorified hall monitors.” I asked 
her if it would be possible to connect with 
SROs on an emotional level. Without hes-
itating a second, Holahan confidently 
answered “No,” before we both giggled at 
her eagerness. 

But Cajigas emphasized that estab-
lishing a connection with SROs—whether 
a friendly relationship or one for mental 
support—can feel like the only option for 
some students when the officers are the 
most accessible and visible choice. “There 
is [almost] no other resources for students 
in the schools . . . to look for support and 
peer mentorship,” Cajigas told me. “Of 
course, they’re gonna rely on the only sys-
tem available.”


Cajigas noted that despite these pos-
itive relationships formed out of necessity, 
SROs are part of an oppressive system that 
is tied to even the well-intended people: 
“The truth is that Black and Brown folks are 
oppressed because of a system, not because 
of individuals. These individuals just so 
happen to be a part of a horrible system.” 

Within this complicated web 
of systemic fault but individual 
kindness, SROs do embody useful support 
systems for some members of NHPS. But 
these views often come with acknowledg-
ments of the tension between individual 
trust and trust of the larger institution of 
the police force. 

“I think he’s a nice person,” Ayush Patel, 
a senior at Hill Regional Career High 
School, says about his SRO. “We were set-
ting up for a robotics event, and he was 
able to find a table for us.” 

I saw a piece of myself in Patel. We 
both went to a predominantly white pri-
mary school and, as a result, we didn’t expe-
rience the surveillance of SROs until high 
school. His face tenses up as he scratches 
the back of his neck. He hesitantly admits 
that “[SRO presence] feels somewhat 
protective, but the fear of just weapons in 
general in school—even if it’s not within 
students—it’s just frightening.” 

Patel’s experience highlights a con-
tradiction. He knows that his SRO is not 
inherently evil. At the same time, he feels 
troubled knowing the SRO wields a gun 
and taser—weapons that disproportion-
ately harm people who look like him and 
his peers. 

Some students sympathize with New 
Haven’s vision of SROs and believe that 
they are effective protectors. Alex Aguirre, 
a junior at Hill Regional Career High 
School, recalls when a student got jumped 
by a group of other students during school 
dismissal. He believes that his SRO acted 
as a sign of “authority that can actually 
stop them [fighters],” and pulled students 
away, ultimately intervening midway 
through the fight. Aguirre views sros as 
the second line of intervention—only 
there if something “crazy” such as phys-
ical altercations happens, while social 
workers can deal with the “small” issues 
such as arguments.


A school psychologist I spoke with, 
who requested to remain anonymous due 
to concern over the security of their job, 
explained that they view social workers, 
school psychologists, and SROs all as a team 
of trusted adults. This team, in theory, acts 
as social support for students and reaches 
out based on whatever the student’s 
individual needs. A safe school climate, 
according to the psychologist, comes from 
building relationships between teachers 
and the mental health support team. The 
psychologist expressed a fervent hope for 
increased mental health support as a way 
to provide more time and care for students’ 
specific needs. More importantly, they 
underscored that the students’ opinions in 
this conversation about SROs and mental 
health support will ultimately be the most 
vital, as they are the biggest stakeholders in 
this conversation. 

Like the school psychologist, Patel 
and Aguirre both seemed to agree that 
SROs represent a degree of safety within 
NHPS. In a perverse cycle, however, this 
safety is temporary. We often observed a 
fight, saw the SRO and security guards help 
break it up, and then waited for the next 
one. Watching this, many students came to 
associate SROs with safety since they were a 
reactionary measure to immediately resolve 
a situation. But even if SROs do break up 
school fights, the underlying roots of this 
violence are not resolved. Often the fight 
continues off school grounds—including 
near our school bodega, where I’ve seen 
student videos circulating. 

Despite differing views on SROs, both 
Patel and Aguirre supported Citywide’s 
protest, with Aguirre attending in solidar-
ity with his friends who demanded better 
mental health support. Across their vary-
ing stances on SROs, the students I spoke 
with all just wanted to feel safe at schools 
and have an investment in more mental 
health services. 

Dr. Wendy Decter, a teacher who 
recently left NHPS after seventeen years, 
echoed 
these 
fundamental 
concerns. 
Decter explained how an ideal world 
would have more mental health resources 
to keep kids on track. She emphasized the 
importance of having as many people in 
school buildings to make student life eas-
ier. She hopes that SROs can be a reassur-
ing presence for people as they are another 
route of adult support for students. She 
noted that some SROs become ingrained 
into the community, becoming familiar 
with students and their families. 

“I think the SRO was a wonderful 
resource, they knew [students] from a 
totally different perspective than the teach-
ers and the school administration,” Decter 
said, alluding to the idea that SROs come 
from students’ own communities. “There 
should have been hiring of as many social 
workers, school counselors, school psy-
chologists as possible, and making them as 
available to the students in school as easily 
as they could be made.” 

Within the status quo, some still 
believe the police to be the most effective 
form of safety. This is despite the fact that, 
as Cajigas pointed out, SROs have not been 
able to deter school shootings, even as far 
back as Columbine. In a hundred ninety- 
seven instances of gun violence at U.S. 
schools since 1999, SROs intervened suc-
cessfully in only three instances. 

When I imagine a safer and more 
just school, I envision a police-free 
space. Imagining NHPS without SROs 
can be difficult because surveilled schools 
are all that the majority of my peers have 
experienced—we have gotten desensitized. 
While I have the privilege to draw upon my 
knowledge of an SRO-free school before 
high school, this position does not fix the 
widespread lack of students’ understanding 
about how the disinvestment in SROs will 
improve school health and culture.


At my middle school, much like 
NHPS, we would attend class, socialize with 
friends, and work in the library. But we did 
all these things without a police car parked 
alongside the school, police officers roam-
ing the halls, and entering through a metal 
detector. These two experiences still coexist 
with one another. I have friends who have 
never experienced police in their schools, 
while others view it as unquestionably the 
norm. This tension raises further questions 
as to why SROs are still viewed as trusted 
and necessary figures by some groups in 
the NHPS community. 

“What the hell does better New Haven 
Public Schools mean? For me, and for a lot 
of my peers, it means having schools that 
nourish our souls in a way that actually 
matters,” Dave Cruz Bustamante, a youth 
community organizer and current NHPS 
student told me.


This pattern of SROs’ surveillance hasn’t 
shifted much since my or Washington’s 
years at high school. Although more SROs 
are allocated in larger schools, the students 
I talked with revealed that it didn’t matter 
their student population: each school had 
only one to three social workers—the same 
way I left the school. 

With the staff’s limited numbers and 
emotional bandwidth, it seems inevita-
ble that NHPS students would experience 
mental exhaustion. Despite the seven hun-
dred student turnout at the Citywide pro-
test, Cruz Bustamante, who now serves as 
an NHBOE student representative, told me 
the NHBOE “is taking very small steps like 
revising the MOU with the police depart-
ment . . . almost not noticeable at all.” They 
even admitted that by the end of their term, 
nothing entirely revolutionary would likely 
be changed about SROs due to the bureau-
cratic inactivity in the NHBOE. 

Instead of relying on reactionary fig-
ures like SROs, NHPS should instead look 
to preventive measures including hiring 
more healthcare professionals. Mental 
health professionals can intercept an issue 
before it manifests into something more 
harmful. This is especially vital as those 
with incomes below the federal poverty 
threshold and  individuals, the main demo-
graphics of NHPS, are disproportionately 
represented in the American carceral and 
legal system. Cajigas and Citywide have 
set out to transform this inequity, especially 
within the context of legislative work. 

Washington and Cajigas both told me 
that their campaign against SROs is “only 
phase one”—they plan to rethink commu-
nity security as a whole. Cajigas explained 
that Citywide is reflecting on other forms 
of monitoring, including if older commu-
nity members were employed as monitors 
in the place of SROs and security guards. In 
practice, this intervention could look like a 
community member with no affiliation to 
the police entering the school, rather than 
pulling in outsider cops from neighboring 
towns. Cajigas emphasized the need for 
NHPS students to be served and protected 
by members of the same community, dis-
affiliated from a system that notoriously 
harms BIPOC.


As an NHPS alum, I’ve now become 
disconnected from the experience of SROs 
I had a year ago. I no longer have a fully 
armed police officer watching every move 
my peers and I make out of fear we will 
break into a fight. Security guards no lon-
ger view my lunch container as a “weapon” 
since it’s glass. Yale is only a fifteen-minute 
walk from my old high school, yet my sta-
tus as an Ivy League student has exempted 
me from being as surveilled by the police 
as I was in high school. At Yale, even when 
police roam around Cross Campus, they 
aren’t hounding students who are skipping 
lectures. The rationale behind this massive 
shift in surveillance has weighed on me.


Functioning for a year both at Yale 
and since the walkout prompted me to 
question whether we need SROs for a safe 
school environment. And though I went 
to an SRO-free school for most of my aca-
demic life, my four years in a surveilled 
school still linger within me. At my pre-
dominantly  high school, we would rarely 
have toilet paper and grew accustomed 
to seeing police cars when we walked in 
through a metal detector. Now, I inhabit 
the world of a predominantly white Ivy 
League where students know truffle season 
in Milan and the most consistent police 
presence is guarding the exit to our libraries.


Though I am what feels like a world 
away, I still carry the same habits I did in 
high school, unzipping all six zippers of my 
backpack for a security check in libraries 
and speeding up when I walk by police cars. 
I doubt I’ll lose them any time soon. ∎
