THE CRITICAL ANGLE 
Voice of Atnerica 
0 
N SEPTEMBER 19, 6oo people packed the seats of New Haven's 
Center Church on the Green. Wherever they sat, stood, or 
squatted, they listened in silence, breathless, their eyes trained on a 
small, ancient man hunched behind a podium at the front of the 
church. They listened as his voice, cracked with age, sang out these 
lines: 

In a murderous time 
The heart breaks and breaks 
And lives by breaking. 
It is necessary to go 
Through dark and deeper dark 
And not to turn 
I am looking for the trail. 
Where is my testing-tree? 
Give me back my stones! 

The man was Stanley Kunitz and those lines conclude his best-
known poem, "The Testing-Tree." Told through the eyes of a child 
who uses a monolithic oak for target practice, "The Testing-Tree" 
evokes the anguish of living in the modern age, an age in which the 
sorrow of a single boy is simultaneously profound and furile. 

Kunitz, a former poet laureate, was just one of nine poets to 
perform that night at a reading celebrating the prestigious Bollingen 
Prize for ?oetry, awarded by Yale University every rwo years for 
what it recognizes as ''che very best in American poetry." T he mes-
sage is clear enough. Bollingen winners are not your up-and-com-
ing young talents, rwenty-somethings rotating odd jobs and scrib-
bling away nights in their East Village lofts. Nor are they your poets 
du jour, or those flash-in-the-pan best-sellers. Bollingen po~ts have 
been published, reviewed, reprinted, coUected, awarded, antholo-
gized, and more often than not, offered lush professorships in the 
English departments of the country's top universities. Sharing the 
stage with Kunitz were such luminaries as John Ashbery, Robert 
Creeley, Louise Gluck, John Hollander, ws Merwin, Gary Snyder, 
Mark Strand, and Richard Wilbur. Given the removed and self-
reBective nature of much modern poetry, the event could easily 
have slid into irrelevance, of interest only to the smaU coterie of lit-
erary scholars, professors and university students who comprised 
the audience. Instead, most of the poets attempted to engage the 
current political climate, either by prefacing their work with an 
oven opinion or by embedding it within the poetry itselÂ£ Though 
almost all the poets tried to make a significant comment on the 
rimes, Stanley Kunitz acruaUy succeeded. And his success carne not 
By Kathryn Malizia 
from some bold, new meditation, but from a poem written over 
thirty years ago. 

In 1968, short on inspiration, Kunitz was at Yale, staying with 
Calhoun College Master RWB Lewis before giving a reading. While 
there, Kunirz found a moment of inspiration and completed the 
poem whose ending had beed evading him-none other than "The 
Testing-Tree"-which, at the event, he playfully called "the obscure 
legend of my youth." But regardless of the poet's intentions, "The 
Testing-Tree" is far from obscure and is much more than an auto-
biography. 

By turns comic and tragic, trivial and epic, naive and visionary, 
Kunin's "The Testing-Tree" is to my mind a great American poem 
by a man who should be deemed the poetic voice of America. The 
language is simple, the scenes are eerily familiar, and the voice is 
friendly and intimate. The poem may not come off as high poetry 
in the tradition of, say, "The Wasteland," but that does not dimin-
ish its power. It deals precisely with the toughest questions that we, 
as both humans and Americans, face in our daily lives. 

From its outset, the poem expresses itself in uniquely American 
terms. Composed in four pans, it first carries the reader through a 
parable of American youth and closes with ari oracular vision, 
freighted with the passionate determination "to go /through dark 
and deeper dark I and not to tum." The narrative section by con-
trast benign as it follows the path of a boy who seeks his adversary 
in, of all things, an oak tree: 

On my way home from school 
Up tribal Providence Hill 
Past the Academy ballpark 
Where I could never hope to play 
I scuffed in the drainage ditch 
Among the sodden seethe of leaves 
Hunting for perfect stones 
Rolled out of glacial rime 
Into my pitcher's hand 

T he game being played at the Academy is, of course, easily rec-
ognized. It's basebaU, and the narrator's exclusion from it, perhaps 
an aBusion to Kunin's own ost:racism as a Jew living in America in 
the early 2oth century, marks him as an outsider. The boy finds balls 
for his own solitary game in a nearby ditch. His are not of leather 
but stone, smoothed by the force of ages predating both America 
and its "tribal" predecessors. But before the reader has time tO 
reflect on the implications of that "glacial rime," the boy is off in his
