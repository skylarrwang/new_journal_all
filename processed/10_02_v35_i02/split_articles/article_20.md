EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Amazingly, though, Didi has found 
friends in high places. She is constantly on 
the phone, calling friends, calling the city, 
calling anyone willing to give her a hand. 
Some of her more creative schemes have 
been successful. At the opening of Ashley's 
Ice Cream last month, in front of TV cam-
eras, she told her youngest daughters to ask 
Mayor DeStefano to read them a book. 
The girls' pictures appeared in the New 
Haven Register the next day, and DeStefano 
called Didi back. He found himself a life-
time supporter: Didi wants to work for his 
next reelection campaign. 

This morning, she has promised to 
make breakfast for Ana and Tani, who have 
spent the night at a family friend's apart-
ment. That family friend is Andrea 
Pizziconi, a Yale graduate working for Yale 
University Properties, and a jackpot con-
nection for Didi and her children. Ana and 
Tani met Chris Alexander-who is married 
to Bruce Alexander, Vice President for New 
Haven and State Affairs-as part of the Â· 
New Haven Reads program, which Chris 
runs. In the past few months, she and 
Andrea have 
enrolled 
the 
kids in 
Neighborhood Music School dance classes; 
introduced them to the Yale Book Bank; 
helped six of them switch from their failing 
neighborhood 
school 
to 
Catherine 
Brennan Elementary; and showered them 
with gifts. The kids have also posed for 
many a Yale PR photo. For now, though, 
the older girls are belting out Nelly songs in 
Andrea's living room, and Didi is frying 
bacon. 

Didi makes sure they are fed. "'m 
willing to eat dirt as long as they have 
eggs," she vows. She fills plates even for the 
older children, making sure they get 
enough. Bottles of Kool-aid, once opened, 
must be finished. Didi prods Roy to finish 
his pancake, then lifts up Angel's shirt and 
pats his little belly, pronouncing him 
healthy. Later, she returns from running 
errands with a ~urprise birthday cake for 
Jennifer, who turned four yesterday. The 
older kids, warned to keep Jennifer away 
from the kitchen while Didi puts candles 
on the cake, whisper conspicuously and try 
not to smile in anticipation. Didi blind-
folds Jennifer with her hands, and they 
waddle down the hall together. As soon as 
Didi uncovers Jennifer's eyes in front of the 
cake, six voices break into a passionate ren-
dition of 'Happy Birthday.' 


D
IDI AND HER CHILDREN-by "the grace 
of God," Didi reminds me--are mak-
ing progress. Didi's earnings at her new job 
will not be enough for most apartments in 
New Haven, but it's income nonetheless. 
Her kids have practically moved in with 
Andrea, and she and Chris are using every 
resource they have to find Didi housing. A 
Habitat for Humanity house, a Yale job for 
Jose, and the Yale Homebuyer program are 
being discussed, and Andrea fields calls 
daily from people wanting to help. When 
their CCA cutoff date rolls around, Didi and 
her family will certainly have somewhere to 
go, whether that will be a temporary apart-
ment or Andrea's loft. In a few months, 
they may even have permanent housing. 

Mary Anne, on the other hand, does 
not have Didi's connections. She might 
very well be on the street in two months, 
depending on her 18-year-old son for sup-
port. Affordable housing is only a distant 
hope, and an apartment of her own is prob-
ably beyond reach. Mary Anne has tried to 
follow the traditional avenues out of pover-
ty-applying for the vouchers they told her 
to apply for, scrimping to put food on the 
table--but those avenues are many miles 
longer than she can bear. Mary Anne needs 
more than motivation and government 
aid-she needs people to bend the rules for 
her. For Mary Anne and Didi the system 
has failed. And when a system fails, people 
like Mary Anne have two choices: to work 
outside the system, as Didi has, or to suffer 
within it.
