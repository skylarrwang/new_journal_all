A Formal Feeling Comes
T
HE. LOGO WAS EVERYWHERE-popping out from behind doors, 
~t down from walls, scattered on tables. This carcoony trip-
tych was the spokes picture for Yale's "September II th, One Year 
Later" programming. It was printed on every poster, flyer, and 
handout advertising the memorial events scheduled a year after the 
attacks. 

The logo consists of three pictographs-the first in red, the 
second in white, and the third in blue. The first image is an abstrac-
tion of the Twin Towers-and by abstraction, I mean two off-kilter 
rectangles that look like an overly starched pair of pants, ready to 
drop. The second picture is an aerial view ofThe Pentagon-repre-
sented by bold lines and cracked into pieces (an image probably 
obtained from the same clipart b~k that provided the rectangular 
pants). The third is the outline of an airplane in a nose-clive cowards 
the bottom of the page. The cockpit has already been swallowed up 
by a grass-green border below the logo. On the larger posters there 
is a yellow half circle behind the figures-it looks like the outline of 
a giant asteroid. Under it all: "To commemorate the anniversary of 
the terrorist attacks, Yale is planning a series of educational and 
memorial events to be held on September IOTH and nTH. The pan-
els and concerts are open to the general public." It sounded like a 
birthday invitation and looked like one coo. 

At first I thought that the goal of the 9/n triptych was co cap-
ture 9/11 without sugar-coating any of the horror of the day-no 
patriotic God Bless America testimonials, no waving flags, no "don't 
mess with us" Maybe it was supposed to be grotesque and brutal 
just like 9/n, the more graphic the better. Then where are the bod-
ies? The arms and legs sticking out of gutters? The people falling 
from the IIOTH floor, enveloped in flames? Where is the plume of 
smoke and human ash? 

Broken buildings and shattered machinery were the least hor-
rific part of the day. If the designer was confined co clip art (as the 
triptych suggests), he could have at the very least plunked in some 
stick figures with x's for eyes, staring out the windows as the plane 
crashed to the ground. But maybe it wasn't about horror. Maybe the 
designer had something else in mind. Maybe the object of this 
graphic was to summarize the events that took place lase year, in 
case somebody had forgotten. The logo clidn't even get that right. 
The twin towers clidn't fall over like a sec of blocks. The Pentagon 
clidn'c crack like broken place. We remember it better than that. 

Every time I see one of those posters, now fallen, trodden on, 
and clirty, I am sad. I expected to have things figured out by the 
time this anniversary rolled around. But I haven't. And if I couldn't 
on my own, I was counting on somebody else to explain it. Neither

has happened, and I'm not ready for logos or triptychs or slogans or 
birthday invitations. I need the unabridged explanation first. 

Guns blazing, I confronted the designer of the graphic. Peter 
Johnson grc:eted me with a firm handshake and a smile, armed with 
a folder of his sketches and a few different copies of his graphic. He 
wore khaki pants and a plain, collared shirt. His hair was grayish 
blond, combed neatly to the side and his thin white moustache 
bobbed up and down as he spoke. "It was kind of an impossible 
cask," he said quietly. "Most of my work has been Yale directed, but 
this is a world crisis, a human event, and it definitely put me on the 
edge of my chair. I'm used co areas of imagination, but this was 
beyond imagination." His deep voice began co waver. I put the guns 
away. 

Suddenly, I could imagine being in his shoes. I wanted to 
understand how he went about tackling what seemed like an impos-
sible task. "Almost like writing a poem is how I think about it," he 
explained. "In graphic design, form is like sound and language. 
Poetry encapsulates the sound of language, as opposed co just hav-
ing a literal meaning." 

He pulled out some sheets of paper from a folder. From his 
front pocket, he removed a small notebook of recycled brown 
paper-pages of sketches, each a variation of the approved graphic. 
The clifferences between the drawings were subtle: a clifferent figure 
stood in here or there, the crack ran through the pentagon in dif-
ferent places. Every line of his fmal graphic was drawn with pur-
pose: "I wanted three symbols. I always remembered the Shanksville 
[Pennsylvania] crash. I thought there was such heroism in that par-
ticular ace. I clidn't want to emphasize the towers; I wanted the 
Washington DC attack and the Pennsylvania attack to be just as 
important," he said. "Then, I wanted to gee across a sense of frag-
mentation or rupture or devastation. Shanksville was the most dif-
ficult for me to think about. I had a symbol of plate glass shatter- , 
ing. There was a sense of toppling, breaking, crashing-but these 
are just words, sounds, literal meanings. So I tried co formalize them 
without being coo clever. That was the other mandate. This was no 
place to be clever." 

I hadn't even thought of this ammunition. But of course it 
made sense: to be ingenious or witty with September uth would be 
in poor taste. But what was stancling in for cleverness? The towers 
tumbling, the plane in mid-crash-these images were not clever. 
They were clisturbing. "I wanted it to be alerting," Johnson said. 
"But I clidn't want it to be clistressing or macabre. I clidn't want to 
show ruins or death or have it too horrific." "Why not?" I askeod. 
Maybe it should have been more·clisturbing, more real. "Because we

all kind of know that [it was horrific]. And to identify that would 
almost underplay the seriousness," he said without skipping a beat. 
•I wanted to be alerting in a positive sense." I was not convinced. 
Death should not have been forgotten in order to make the logo 
upbeat, I thought to mysel£ How could he ignore the people in 
those buildings? T his day will go down in history because humans 
were murdered, not because buildings were broken. 

In response, Johnson explained to me the difference between 
formal abstraction and figurative representation. To illustrate his 
point he described the early controversy surrounding the Vietnam 
memorials in Washington oc. He juxtaposed Frederick Hart's sol-
dier monument (a literal depiction of soldiers on the battlefield) 
with the more formalist black gash in the soil. "There are a lot of 
people riding the fence berween formalism and figurative, or literal 
and abstract. . . . I was raised as a formalist. It's my language or 
Vocabulary. As a person who was in Vietnam, I was much more 
drawn to the abstract. And it might be who I am or by the very fact 
that [September nTH] was unimaginable." 

Johnson hadn't ignored death. He just knew what he wanted. 
He knew what he felt did justice co the death associated ~th a war 
that he fought in, and for him Maya Lin's memorial was the most 
llloving-a monument that was abstract. He told me he was trying 
to accomplish something like that. 

To drive his point home, he pulled out an old Nro~ Haven 
~. 
On the outside back cover was his graphic with Yale's 
~nts highlighted below it. On the inside back cover was a huge

oval air brushed picture of the twin rowers standing unscathed. A 
gigantic American flag waved in front of the rowers. In front of the 
flag, two massive hands held a burning candle. Below this picture 
"Our Faith Will Not Be Shaken" was wrinen in bold. The pair of 
pants suddenly didn't look so bad. "A lot of this gets too sentimen-
tal," he said while looking at the burst of patriotism before him. 
"Bur if I use the word sentimental, somebody could say that my 
graphic is too mechanical." His eyes shifted back to his art. 
"Adminedly, I consider it formal; I hope it's not mechanical. I want-
ed it to be poetical." 

But are there answers in his poetry, I wondered. Did he under-
stand September nTH and could I understand it by looking at his 
graphic. "Unimaginable things happened," he told me. "I wasn't 
trying to understand it. I was trying to do the best I could." The 
graphic didn't have gruesome pictures of mangled human bodies, 
but it didn't sugarcoat either. The logo didn't act as an exact caption 
not because the designer forgot what happened or assumed we for-
got; he didn't want it to be literal. His graphic was deliberate. It did-
n't matter that it didn't hold all the answers to September liTH, 
2001-
that wasn't its purpose. Instead it gave us a way to think 
about it. And perhaps just seeing 9/u from different vantages and 
through different mediums gets us closer to some understanding. 
Johnson had the courage to take a stab at it. I'm glad he did.
