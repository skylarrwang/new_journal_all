Peculiar Institutions 
THE MAN SITriNG NEXT TO ME pushes his 
rimless glasses farther up his sunburnt 
nose, his graying blond hair flipped across 
his head. Under a navy cardigan, his 
starched t-shirc is emblazoned with the 
words "REPARATIONS Now!" He is one of 
about a hundred attendees of the "Yale, 
New Haven, and American Slavery 
Conference." Co-sponsored by the Yale 
Law School and the Gilder Lehrman 
Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, 
and Abolition, the conference brought 
together top scholars from September 26TH 
to the 28TH to explore how slavery "shaped 
local experience in New Haven," and to 
"examine ... the contemporary implications 
of the history we in New Haven and at Yale 
have inherited." 

This topic .echoes the title of last sum-
mer's controversial report on Yale's connec-
tions to the institution of slavery: "Yale, 
Slavery, and Abolition." Authored with the 
OcrosER 2002 
support of Yale's labor unions by doctoral 
students Antony Dugdale, JJ Fueser, and J. 
Celso de Castro Alves, the report sparked a 
furor of national media attention. It point-
ed out that initial funds for Yale's first 
scholarship and endowed professorship 
came from slave-trade money and that 
seven of Yale's twelve residential colleges are 
named for slave owners-including former 
Vice Presidem John C. Calhoun, who con-
sidered the phrase "all men are created 
equal" to be "utterly untrue." The authors 
called upon Yale to use the occasion of its 
300TH anniversary to revise its public repu-
tation as an institution with a "long histo-
ry of activism in the face of slavery," as pur-
ported in its brochures. The authors urged 
Yale to acknowledge its connection to slav-
ery-and, most importantly, to consider 
paying reparations to descendants of slaves. 

Robert Forbes, Associate Director of 
the Gilder Lehrman Center, described 
Dugdale, Fueser, and Celso's paper as "not 
a sophisticated piece of scholarship," but 
conceded that their "work is an excellent 
launching pad." Organizers repeatedly 
acknowledged that the graduate students' 
findings triggered the initiative for the con-
ference. "Without provocation this confer-
ence would not have been conceived and 
we owe a debt to that paper," said Yale Law 
School Dean Anthony K.ronman. Forbes 
stated the connection more explicitly. After 
the publication of the report, trumpeted by 
blaring headlines in The New York Times, 
Forbes received a call from Yale President 
Richard Levin's office. "They weren't inter-
ested in a quickie response," said Forbes, 
but instead a "serious scholarly conference 
that engaged the specific questions of the 
report" and "obligations of institutions

across orne. 

Though conference coordinators felt 
indebted to the graduate students for, as 
President Levin put it, "bringing ~ational 
attention to something we often ignore," 
they did not include them in the planning 
process. "My invitation to the conference 
arrived in the mail two days after the dead-
line for registration had passed. This was 
the first time either Antony, Celso, and I 
were contacted by conference organizers," 
Fueser told me. 

Despite the political demands of the 
grad students'. report, the conference was 
conceived as a dispassionate, scholarly 
examination of a complicated history. In 
his opening remarks, Dean K.ronman 
defined the conference as "an academic 
evem [that] belongs to the world of schol-
arship not the world of politics." David 
Davis, Director of the Gilder Lehrman 
Center, asserted that this was "a scholarly 
conference that is in no way meant as a 
reply to [the graduate students'] paper." 

The conference certainly succeeded in 
bringing star scholars to Yale to evince the 
hard history of slavery in the North, and to 
discuss the philosophical hurdles of mone-
tary compensation for pa$t wrongs. David 
Blight, an award-winning historian who 
will join the Yale faculty next January, 
delivered the keynote address in which he 
probed the difference between history and 
memory. The panel charged with examin-
ing "The Moral Claims of the Past: Justice 
Across Time" included Princeton Professor 
Anthony Appiah and former Solicitor 
General Charles Fried. Fried expounded on 
the problems of "attenuation" and "calcu-
lating the half-life of injury" in relation to 
slavery reparation claims. He asserted that 
all that was due was an "inquiry into the 
uuth ... that above all is what is owed and 
that is a debt this conference is paying." 

Several attendees did not concur, and 
criticized the conference for being overly 
scholastic. Warren Kimbro, who runs a 
half-way house in New Haven, knocked 
the conference as "just another academic 
exercise," another instance of "white liber-
als leading us down the road of reparations. 
. . . I'd like to see Yale do a conference on 
why there's a generation of young black 
men in prison." Reverend Eric Smith of the 
New Haven Reparations Coalition reiterat-
ed Kimbro's worry tha~ the conference, and 
Yale's stand on reparaci~ns, was merely aca-
demic. "Generations of school children will 
learn about the Yale, Slavery and Abolition 
report and about this conference," he said. 
"If nothing gets done they are going to ask 
5 

why and you can't help bur wonder how 
they will feel about this conference, Yale ... 
and· about their world." 

Blight opened his speech with a refer-
ence to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One 
Hundred Years of Solitude, describing 
Marquez's portrait of a world without 
memory as one where "people lost their 
identity in the anarchy of ignorance." But 
perhaps knowledge roo can create a kind of 
anarchy, one in which a muddle of phrases 
like "notions of memory" and "the half-life 
of injury" distract institutions from their 
practical responsibilities.
