ride back to Grandpa's house. Oh, this is a 
lifesaver." The trolley let the old lady and 
her grandson out at the corner of Audobon 
and O range. "This was fun. Say goodbye to 
the trolley man," she said as she stepped 
off. The boy stood on the corner and waved 
to the conductor, who rung the trolley's 
bell three times in response. "That's a loud 
one, huh?" he asked the little boy paternal-
ly, before closing the doors and continuing 
down Orange. 

I slid up front and struck up a conver-
sation with the conductor. Frank was 
happy to talk and, in a slow drawl, began to 
tell me about life on the trolley. We turned 
left back onto Elm, right on State Sueet, 
and left on Chapel. We passed six trolley 
stops without another rider. I asked Frank 
how many people he sees on a typical day. 
"Usually in eight hours on a Saturday you 
do 6o to a hundred people," he told me. 
"Which is not a lot. You get a lot of kids 
with their grandparents, with mothers and 
fathers. They're the biggest riders." T he 
trolley is currently free, but Frank expects 
that when the weather changes, more peo-
ple will start riding, and he will have to ask 
passengers tO deposit their quarters in the 
fare canister by the door. 

The trolley pulled up to the corner of 
College and Chapel. Another elderly 
woman and her ten-year-old granddaugh-
ter got on. They sat across from me and I 
asked them why they were riding. "Oh, for 
sightseeing," answered the grandmother. 
The granddaughter told me she's never rid-
den a trolley before. (Well, she still hasn't.) 

After rounding York and Elm, we stopped 
at the corner of Elm and Temple. On the 
curb, a portly man with a thick black 
moustache smiled, reached in the air and 
pumped his arm, the universal gesture for 
'pull the bell, buddy.' Frank stepped on the 
bell pedal. Ding-dong. The portly man and 
the rest of the crowd at the bus stop 
cheered and got onto their bus. 

The bus blew past us towards North 
Haven, emitting diesel fumes from its tail 
pipe. I wondered what that $1.5 million 
might have done had it been put towards 
cleaning up the real mass transportation of 
New Haven. 

Like the trolleys themselves, the dream 
behind the trolley was hybrid: an anempt 
to marry cooked-up memories of New 
Haven's booming past with a muddled 
future of economic renewal and environ-
mentally-friendly technology. It's sweet and 
benign, but its nostalgia is no more than 
novelty, and its green goals stretch only as 
far as its route around an apathetic Yale 
campus and a gentrified downtown. 

"How long we riding this?" the grand-
daughter asked her grandmother, as she 
curled up in the crook of her heavy arm. 
"Till we get back to where we got on." The 
granddaughter pulled on her grandmoth-
er's arm. "Please can we stay on here till 
four o'clock?" The trolley pulled back up to 
their stop on the New Haven Green and 
the grandmother got up and walked to the 
opening door. "I don't wanna go, I don't 
wanna!" the granddaughter called out mis-
chievously. The grandmother glanced back 
and stepped out the door. "Come on," she 
said. The girl bounced on the seat two 
more times, popped up and scampered out 
the door. "Thank you, thank you!" she 
called out to Frank, who smiled and waved. 

I was once again alone with Frank. As 
we rounded Chapel onto York, Frank asked 
me how many times I planned on riding 
the trolley. A little taken aback, I replied 
that I'd be getting off soon. 

"It's okay," he said apologetically. 
"We're only allowed to go around with 
somebody once. I didn't know either. I 
went with some old guy for seven trips the 
other day. It was raining, and I don't think 
he had anywhere to go. My supervisor met 
me at a stop and he says, 'Forgot to tell you, 
but people can only ride once.' It being free 
and all." 

I got off at the corner of York and Elm. 
Frartk rang the bell and floated away alone.
