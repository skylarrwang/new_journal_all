Anal Attentive 
IT's A GOOD THING CoNNEcriCUT has at 
least one candidate in November's congres-
sional election with the answers to one of 
the 21ST century's most pressing crises. A 
global disaster like the AIDS epidemic calls 
for an informed and clear-sighted leader 
like Joseph A. Zdonczyk, who hopes to 
represent the Concerned Citizens Party in 
the coming election. 

Zdonczyk doesn't resort to quick-fix 
solutions to the epidemic like promoting 
safer sex ("You can ask anybody. It adds to 
the spread of the HIV virus.") or increasing 
funding for AIDS research ("Let's consider 
how much money is being spent on devel-
oping a cure for Hrv compared to the real 
killers.") And as for those "concoctions" 
scientists keep testing? It's simpler than 
that. 

Unlike any scientist ro date, rhe 
Concerned Citizen knows the single for-
mula that "stops mv in its tracks." The key, 
he recognizes, is simply "to remain true to 
your state of life." And remaining true to 
your state of life means heterosexual activi-
ties only, no "extracurriculars." Because, 
the aspiring public official explained, "All 
the stuff I've read leads me to believe; look, 
if you're doing something abnormal, you 
have to expect consequences." 

Though Zdonczyk is the first to admit 
that he's not a scientist, his position is 
strongly supported by a few of his own sci-
entific theories. "Your human anatomy is 
made to function in a certain way," he 
explained carefully. "You can't twist your 
arms in the back of you without breaking 
your arms. You can't stick a thumb in your 
6 
eye without going blind. When a penis is 
inserted in a man's anus, thar is a total ... I 
don't even know how to describe it ... it is 
so abnormal." 

Strangely, this logic is often shunned 
by scientists, who manage time and rime 
again to overlook the simple facts. For 
example, even Alvin Novick, a professor of 
biology and public health ar Yale-also, 
incidentally, a physician, a scientist, a past 
editor of the AJDS and Public Policy 
]ourna4 a co-founder of many AIDS pro-
grams in New Haven, and a consultant co 
organizations like the Centers for Disease 
Control-fails to grasp the finer points of 
Joseph A. Zdonczyk 
Zdonczyk's theory. Scientists like Novick 
go so far as to insist that "disrespect" for 
homosexuals spreads the scourge like wild-
fire. Anne Williams, a nurse practitioner 
who works with AIDS patients in New 
Haven, subscribes to this same fiction. 
"The stigma," she claimed, "still keeps peo-
ple from care or sends people to care that's 
not cutting-edge." 

But facts are facts. And the intolerance 
for immorality that Novick and Williams 
call stigma is for Zdonczyk nothing more 
than good, old-fashioned virtue. Afrer all, 
Zdonczyk's theories are backed by histori-
cal evidence as well as Sunday School 
teachings. According to Zdonczyk, the first 
cases of AIDS occurred in gay men. "It was 
originally in the homosexual community. 
Now it's in the heterosexual community," 
he explained. "It wasn't there and now it is. 
What kind of conclusion can you draw?" 

Of course, Zdonczyk concedes, we 
really don't have enough information to 
make a definitive link. "You'd have to have 
someone with medical research experience 
conducting tests," he acknowledges. But 
let's be honest with ourselves. Is that really 
necessary? "Sometimes," Zdonczyk says, 
"you can look at circumstantial evidence 
and draw a conclusion." Zdonczyk didn't 
draw that conclusion without reading 
between the lines of the history books. "Do 
you know what they used to call AIDS?" he 
asks. 

"GRIDS: 
Gay-related 
Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome." Why the name 
change? The little-known explanation lies 
in the subversive influence of the gay pop-
ulation. "The homosexuals must have put 
pressure on the physicians and medical 
community so that the name was changed 
to AIDS." Since it's common knowledge 
that "the homosexual community is very, 
very politically and monetarily powerful," 
it's a wonder the scientists don't see it. Afrer 
all, Zdonczyk points our, homosexuals 
"don't have families to raise, expenses that 
married people have." 

But for some reason, Novick and oth-
ers who claim expertise in the field reduce 
AIDS to a "medical and public health prob-
lem," and refuse to acknowledge that the 
cure for AIDS lies in assigning blame. 

Novick isn't even satisfied with the enor-
mous funds the epidemic has already 
sapped from more serious projects--even 
in Connecticut, where he claims AIDS pro-
grams are among the world's best. "The 
best isn't good enough," he said. Evidently 
nor-not for the selfish, that is. 

Zdonczyk's perspective on this issue is 
broad-minded and compassionate, and at 
that, a welcome deparnue from common 
misconceptions. Zdonczyk sees this fund-
ing for what it really is: a "serious injustice" 
that can kill innocent people. 

By enabling those who contracted HIV 
to succumb to their "appetites," he 
laments, "you are actually contributing to 
the deaths of many who are victims of can-
cer." And victims of cancer, Zdonczyk 
points out, are not the only ones to suffer 
at the expense of the gay community. 
"Now," he said sadly, "we see AIDS spread 
about the world and millions have died and 
probably millions will die." What's more, 
"the homosexual community is using those 
other people as an excuse to demand addi-
tional funding." As if medical funding 
weren't enough, Novick and his colleagues 
also fight for education programs, to pre-
vent AIDS by teaching "safer sex." Zdonczyk
