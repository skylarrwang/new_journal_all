WHEN SH E TAKES THE FLOOR in the elegant 
atrium of Beinecke Library, Yale Provost 
Alison Richard reminds us of a recent past 
that nonetheless feels as ancient as the 
library's volumes. "When I came to Yale in 
1972," she begins, "there were six tenured 
women faculty. Now every year there are 
more and more women. But I am not 
going to spout statistics at you." 

She does not need to. Tonight's audi-
ence speaks for itself. Almost a hundred 
women have come together under the aus-
pices of the Women's Faculty Forum (WFF) 
to welcome new women faculty and 
administrators and to recognize women 
who have recently received tenure. These 
newcomers are now part of a community of 
L48 female faculty members, nearly twice 
the number of ten years ago. 

The Forum came into existence dur-
ing preparations for the Tercentennial last 
year. Professors, thinking it would be a 
temporary group, planned a series of events 
to chronicle the effects of coeducation at 
Yale and the growth of scholarship related 
to women since the 1970s. But despite the 
prevailing optimism of the series, the 
women involved also became more acutely 
aware of how many problems remained. In 
the wake of their success, the group secured 
a charter extending its existence for three 
more years, resolving to make sure that the 
University kept increasing diversity and 
that scholars kept addressing women's 
issues.

The group got to work identifying 
what needed to change in order for more 
women to get tenure. After looking into 
the question, they decided that their top 
priorities were childcare and parental leave 
policy. Elizabeth Dillon, Assistant Professor 
of English and American Studies, spear-
heads the WFP investigation into parenting 
faculty needs. "T he biggest issue is that 
people can't find childcare and they cannot 
afford it," says Dillon. "To get a place in a 
· Yale-affuiated child care center, Assistant 
Professor of English Amy Hungerford had 
to start paying a thousand dollars a month 
to secure a place. T his was before her kid 
was even born!" Coming to Yale with two 
young daughters, Dillon found herself 
spending two thirds of her salary on child-
care alone. "The problem is that by and 
large these people are junior faculty mem-
bers. At the time that you are trying to real-
ly struggle to get tenure is also the time that 
you are struggling to care for your chil-
dren." Not just policy, but attitudes need to 
change. In the eyes of some colleagues, 
Dillon explains, "there is a way in which 
you become body and not mind when you 
are pregnant." Strategies that women have 
developed to cope with these obstacles can 
have unforeseen consequences. "(Some 
junior professors] are putting it off until 
they get tenured, and then often times they 
are no longer able to have kids," she 
laments. "The shape of the academic career 
is based on an old model, that of a male 
head of household and a wife," Dillon says. 
"The entire society needs to think through 
a new model of family life and work life." · 

By and large, however, Dillon is less 
worried for women in the humanities than 
for those in the still overwhelmingly male 
disciplines like math and science. Megan 
Urry, Professor of Physics & Astrophysics 
and the Director of the Yale Center for 
Astronomy and Astrophysics, agrees that 
women in the sciences face more problems 
balancing career and family. "Younger 
women are coming to me worried that they 
have to c:hoose between being a mother and 
having a career," she says. She identifies 
with some of their fears. "When I got preg-
nant, I was afraid to tell people. I thought 
they would write me off." 

The WFP aims to eliminate these obsta-
cles for future generations of female facul-
ty. In the coming year, they will continue 
sponsoring events and programs and
