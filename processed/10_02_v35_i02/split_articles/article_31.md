state-of-the-art "magic Keels," tearing down the road, the "world's 
fastest human." 
Next, he comes to a bend in the road, but resists its turn 
toward home in favor of a "nettled field," an undisturbed natural 
expanse, replete with "rabbit-life," bees and "a stringy old lilac ... 
blazing with mildew" that guards the entrance of the woods where-
in stands the testing tree. But the boy does not enter the wood 
unprepared. He tells of a "key" he once owned to a moss-thickened 
trail, where, he says, "flickering presences/gave me rite of passage." 
He follows resolutely in the footsteps of Massassoit, the Indian who 
forged the legendary treaty with the first pilgrims. Kunin hearkens 
back to the historic moment when America's first civilization 
embraced the one that would eventually supplant it. Centuries later 
his boy narrator still practices his "Indian walk" as he creeps 
through the primitive wood. 

At the end of this symbolic retreat into nature, past a quarry 
abandoned by its human creators, the boy comes to a clearing where 
all at once the stones in his pocket become "oracles" in the shadow 
of the testing tree. He describes his confrontation with the tree as 
an "appointment," as though this meeting were fated or at least 
agreed upon in advance. He has come to play a game against a 
monolith of nature he describes as "tyrant and target, I Jehovah of 
acorns I watchtower of the thunders." The tree is both enemy and 
savior, an earthly thing invested with an imagined supernatural 
power to save or damn, depending on the skill of the thrower. 
Although the game is ostensibly only a test, target practice for the 
real thing, the boy plays "for keeps," going so far as to invoke the 
blessing of his absent father (Kunin's father committed suicide 
before he was born) on his "good right arm." Like the real game, he 
bas only three throws, and he hurls his oracles "for love, for poetry, 
I and for eternal life," a redemptive trilogy that, years later, he will 
find worth fighting for against more than mere trees. 

And that necessiry to fight comes crashing in with the fourth 
part. It opens with a bizarre recurring dream, in which the boy, now 
grown, is directed to a well containing an albino walrus, a perverse 
white elephant prophesying a "murderous time." The natural world 
of the testing tree, and the innocent, idealized America it symbol-
izes are gone, swept away by a "single Model A" that "unfurled a 
highway behind I where the tanks maneuver, I revolving meir tur-
rets." The safe, isolated fantasy of youth and the testing tree have 
given way to a cruel, mechanized reality of war. Whether America 
>ever was an idyllic natural paradise inhabited by peace-loving 
Indian tribes is beside the point. In the mind of the speaker and by 
ettension, in the mind of American itself, something has changed.

T he promised land of the past, where a boy could practice for the 
challenges ahead without facing those of the present, no longer 
exists. Those challenges are here and they must be met. The speak-
er, whose heart lives only to break in anguish, knows that he must 
journey "through dark and deeper" without any "key" or "rite of 
passage" to help him find a path. He is lost in a modern world he 
had no part in creating. But the boy in him cries out still: 
I am looking for the trail. 
Where is my testing-tree? 
Give me back my stones! 
It is a futile and anguished cry, wracked with longing for an irrecov-
erable past, whether it be the author's vanished youth or America's 
vanished innocence. 

It was these words, along with the two previous tercets begin-
ning with "In a murderous time," that Kunin had labored over 
when he visited Yale in 1968. One night, he told the audience at the 
reading, he had been working on the poem and went down to the 
kitchen. Master Lewis was watching the nightly news when he 
walked in, and on the television he saw that Martin Luther King, 
Jr. had been shot. Kunin recalled, "The news was too much for 
me." He returned to his room and furiously completed the poem. 
With these nine lines, Kunin belied his humble intentions of telling 
the mere "obscure legend" of his youth; instead, he had created a 
poem that transcended subjectivity. In this way, "The Testing-Tree" 
represents Kunin's brilliance: He recognizes that one cannot dwell 
forever in the past or the personal, and that poetry, to be great, must 
inevitably step outside itself. 

"The Testing-Tree" is a deeply American poem. Without 
directly commenting on the assassination of Martin Luther King, 
Jr., it still confronts the tragedy, and by implication, America's oft 
troubled past. But more than a historical conscience, Kunin is 
America's prophet, interpreting the unexplainable in familiar terms. 
He sees America in a way that it cannot see itself: in the immediate 
present.
