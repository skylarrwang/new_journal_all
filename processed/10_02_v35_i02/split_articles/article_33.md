Yale University has a special commitment to New Havens young 
people. More than 10,000 New Haven young people participate in 
Yale-sponsored academic and athletic programs on the Yale campus 
every year, and thousands of Yale students work with public school 
children through Dwight Hall and other programs. 

These Yale student tutors in America Reads and America Counts will provide 45,000 hours 
of literacy and mathematics instruction to over 600 New Haven Public School students. Yale 
University has contributed nearly $100 million to educational and cultural outreach programs 
and to community investments outside its campus in New Haven over t~e past dozen years.
