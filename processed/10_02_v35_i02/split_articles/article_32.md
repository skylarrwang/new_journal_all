Y
ALE BEGAN CREATING ITS OWN HISTORY from the moment itS 
history began. "The Victorious Crew of 1859," a painting 
held in Sterling Memorial Library's Manuscripts and 
Archives, is prime evidence. The rowers in the picture are enjoying 
their moment, but not in the way the adult coaches in the painting 
would like. They are not taking themselves too seriously. They stand 
casually. Their oars extend comically upwards, dwarfing the heroes 
below. But the two elders flanking them understand that history is 
in the making. One man is turning towards the team, in a posture 
of battlefield gravity. The other man, identified as 
Commodore Page, holds a flag and faces 
inwards as well, barely at ease. The 
flag he holds may very well be the 
original source of Yale Blue. To 
most observers it is a relic of the 
past, but to University Printer 
John Gambell the flag taunts, . 
"come and get me." 

While the history of Yale Blue 
is mostly a subject of cocktail conversa-
tions among retired alums, for Gambell it is 
part of his job. In one month the Printer's Office will 
make a resource available to guide the design of Yale materials. This 
has forced them to ask the unthinkable: Should Yale Blue be reeval-
uated? Former University Printer Greer Allen has a range of possi-
ble blues in mind. Among them, he said, "My preference would be 
a color that appears dark, rich blue, which is identifiable from 
black." Tom Strong, who does graphic design for Yale, prefers a 
darker blue. For practical purposes there is an official Yale Blue, 
Pantone 289, but the working definition is another matter. Gambell 
describes it as "a strong, relatively dark blue, neither purple nor 
green, though it can be somewhat gray. It should be a color you 
would call blue." 

If the definition of Yale Blue is vague, that is because itS his-
tory is vague. The early sons of Eli, observing the blue of today, 
would go red in the face. "Old Yale forever! Ever green may she be!" 
said William Maxwell Evarts in 1853. Green was Yale's color for half 
a century, until 1894, when blue officially replaced it. Most respon-
sible for the shift were the members of the "Victorious Crew." 
Former University Secretary Carl Lohmann traced Yale's blue to an 
original piece: "A Commodore's flag, a blue silk burgee, heavily 
fringed with white silk . . . was bought by Commodore Waite." 
Within the next decade the crew began to wear pantS of dark blue 
and dark blue handkerchiefs, and their adoring fans wore blue to 
match. 

The origin of Yale Blue was obscured, however, by historians' 
wish for a grander, longer tradition. In a 1918 article, Franklin 
Bowditch Dexter looked to the opening days of the Collegiate 
School for the source of the blue. A purchase of blue calico in 1708 
and blue paint on the buildings of the original school were his 
proof But Dexter sought a convenient continuity that never exist-
ed. His theories were debunked twenty years later. 

In 1938 another painting was dedicated to the self--conscious I 
creation of Yale history. This time the canvas was filled entirely by 
itS subject, Yale Blue. Lohmann, the same man responsible for 
recording the 1853 appearance of Yale Blue, wanted to settle the 
question once and for all. Under the Office of the Secretary, a piece 
of silk w~ chosen to preserve Yale Blue, and a painting made to 
match it. There are two competing descriptions of the origins of 
this piece of silk. According to one story, the color 
was selected with the cooperation of alumni 
and 
the 
administration 
under I 
Lohmann's direction. In another 
version, 
President 
Seymour 
bought the silk himself on a trip 
to Oxford. Given Lohmann's 
other efforrs to enthrone Yale 
Blue, it seems likely that he is the 
author. But whatever the source, the 
color first appeared on President 
Seymour's inaugural robe. The piece of silk 
now resides in a vault in Woodbridge Hall and has guided 
every decision about Yale Blue since. 

"Wouldn't it be nice to say it was this Yale Blue," Gambell says I 
wistfully. Yet, even with the cloth in hand, he is still looking for the 
elusive color. In the mid 1950s the Secretary's Office launched a sec-
ond search for Yale Blue. The silk and painting ftom 1938, while 
adequate for matching fabrics, were little help in matching ink. The 
Munsell color system, developed in 1952, was the most convenient 
way to establish a new standard. Rumor has it that when the 
University made itS match and ordered 50 pounds of ink mixed, the 
ink company replied that they already had that ink in stock: It was 
the shade used by the Modess sanitary pad company. Whatever 
pink was put into the cheeks of the past administration has since 
faded, however, and for Gambell this is just one more lead. When I 
all his factS are gathered, Gambell will decide if the current Pan tone 
289 is the best representation of Yale Blue, or if a more recently 
developed Pantone color is a closer match. 

Silks fade and color systems change and Gambell is left con· 
sidering the particulars of tradition. Which choice does better jus-
tice to Yale: keeping the current Pantone standard, or adjusting it 
coward a better bluer past? Greer Allen has had a lot of time to think 
about this. He has resolved that the question, "if ever settled once 
and for all, would leave Yale a bland, boring and uninteresting 
University. So my morning prayers regularly include the fervent 
hope, 'Dear Lord, please have the answers to the questions sur· 
rounding Yale Blue and the V~and Map forever elude us!" II1J
