E CANNOT HELP HIMSELF: In the small lower Manhattan 
Development Corporation (LMoc) office, Alexander Garvin is 
ever the professor. In the conference room, Garvin, Vice President 
for Planning, Design, and Development at the LMDC, gestures out 
the glass window overlooking Ground Zero. He could be pointing 
at a chalkboard as he traces his finger in the air along the subway 
platform that will someday stand next to the footprints of the Twin 
Towers. The view is like a slide in one of his classes, only the build-
ings and the people swarming below are in the here and now. 

Sporting his characteristic bowtie, which mirrors the symmetry 
of his equally distinctive, flyaway eyebrows, Garvin demonstrates 
how to look critically at Lower Manhattan. For Garvin the act of 
teaching never ceases, which is ironic since he never intended to 
teach (or become a public official for that matter, though he also 
serves on the New York City Planning Commission). "I was con-
vinced I would be an architect and that life would be very simple," 
Garvin says, "My life did not turn out that way." 

Life has not been simple, in part because Garvin is also an 
Adjunct Professor of Urban Planning and Management at Yale, 
teaching courses in Yale College and the School of Architecture. 
Garvin's occupations often coincide, however; as a guiding force at 
the LMDC, he is responsible' for hiring the staff--one third of whom 
are Yale graduates. Among the staffers with Yale diplomas are 
Brandon Smith, Hugh Eastwood, Brett Rubin (who all graduated 
in the last three years), and five others, including two LMDC vice 
presidents and one board member. The large number of Yalies on 
the staff is a joke around the office, repeated enough that it almost 
seems serious. Says EB Kelly, a Yale senior who worked as an intern 
under Garvin this summer, "No one will rat us out until we rede-
velop Lower Manhattan in the shape of a big Y." 

The coterie ofYale graduates helping to make this possible are 
all "Garvinistas," as the professor's protégés are affectionately called. 
The label comes from a baseball cap Garvin wears on occasion, with 
"Soy un Garvinista" across the front. A present from a former stu-
