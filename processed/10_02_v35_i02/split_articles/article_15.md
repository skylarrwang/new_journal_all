SPORTING A FADED BLUE SWEATER, worn 
jeans, and scuffed white tennis shoes, Pecer 
Davis could almost pass for the average 
New Havener. That is, until I spot the half-
filled eight-gallon oil can in his hand, its 
contents clearly visible through che plastic. 
His brow furrowing, he cells me, "I just 
city life. These days he ceaselessly patrols 
the screecs and riverbanks for illegal dump-
ing. He claims to have collected 14 million 
pounds of debris over the past 16 years. 

Davis's newest nemesis is a particular-
ly nasty post-industrial eyesore on the 
Quinnipiac riverfront: che Lloyd Terminal 
Company in Fair Haven. "Don't get me 
wrong," Davis says of the company's oper-
ations, "''m not against the principle of 
scrap metal recycling in general. But I am 
against what hurts our wildlife and our 
community." Davis claims chat tO save 
money and escape financial trouble, Lloyd 
Terminal has piled its barges so high that 
debris falls off in co che river. This flotsam is 
more than just the standard fare of rotten 
shoes and discarded milk cartons that litter 
any urban river: Davis has found needles, 
wheels, half-filled oil cartons, car axles, 
traces of asbestos, and an entire piano. 

With rain and high tides, che waste spills 
An overflowing barge on the Quinnipiac River 
picked this up ceo minutes ago on Chapel. 
Sometimes I just don't understand people." 

Originally from the Hill neighborhood, 
Peter Davis has long deale with the envi-
ronmental dilemmas that plague industrial 
cities like New Haven. 16 years ago, how-
ever, Davis decided that he and his home-
town had taken enough of a beating. The 
result has been what friends and foes alike 
term a "one-man crusade" against environ-
mental injustice--and environmental apa-
thy. A major breakthrough carne in 1994, 
when he established Canoe New Haven, a 
youth program intended to provide the 
children of some of New Haven's poorest 
neighborhoods with a scenic escape from 


into the river and spreads. 

Davis gestures anxiously at a photo-
graph of a boy splashing in the Quinnipiac 
with his dog. "There are people who fish in 
this river, who make their living from it. 
And despite the water warnings, people 
will swim in the water-like chis kid. Eight 
gallons of oil pollutes roughly 1000 gallons 
of water. And I've found thousands of dis-
carded oil cartons on these streets and river 
banks." Davis considers Lloyd Terminal's 
repeated violations of metal crushing regu-
lations co be dangerous not only environ-
mentally but symbolically as well. He 
attributes the recent rise in local illegal 
dumping pardy co Lloyd Terminal's setting 
a bad example. H e laments, "Once these 
companies get a government permit, they 
do anything they want, and the people start 
to chink they can do che same thing." 

Thanks in large part to his efforts, 
however, 
the 
Department 
of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) has fined 
Lloyd Terminal repeatedly. In May of 2002, 
the state ruled that Lloyd Terminal could 
continue to transfer irs remaining scrap, 
but suspended indefinitely the company's 
right to crush additional scrap metal. 

According to Davis, however, the issue 
remains unresolved, and Lloyd Terminal 
has continued its metal crushing operations 
despite the impositions of the DEP and the 
local police. As we drive to the site in his 
pickup, Davis tells me that he has received 
a call from a local fisherman, his "eyes and 
ears," telling him that the Lloyd Terminal 
machines have been pounding metal all 
day. As we pull up to the site, a bright yel-
low scrap metal machine is squatting in the 
middle of a towering mound of refuse. Less 
than 30 feet downstream is a fisherman 
playing his trade. Workers from the Lloyd 
Terminal site begin eyeing us, and Davis-
who's already slapped the owner of Lloyd 
Terminal with two lawsuits for personally 
threatening him--decides it's time to go. 

As the smokestacks and rust of indus-
trial Fair Haven blur by us, Davis points 
out the pristine oudine of East Rock to our 
right. "The contrast is unmistakable," he 
says. "The people of Fair Haven want 
what's over there over here." What Davis 
has in mind is a confluence of New Haven 
communities through the "natural green-
ways and natural blessings" of New Haven: 
the Mill River, the West River, and the 
Quinnipiac. When I ask him about . the 
reality of his vision in light of his tussle 
with the Lloyd Terminal Company, his 
weatherbeaten face twists into a wry smile. 
He assures me that the gradual return of 
wildlife to the area is a sign that his efforts 
have not been fruidess. He also praises the 
efforts of Mayor DeStefano, who "has seen 
the vision" and is now fully behind Davis' 
efforts to battle Lloyd Terminal. "I'll never 
give in," Davis asserts. "My sons would 
never forgive me. They expect me to come 
back covered in mud."
