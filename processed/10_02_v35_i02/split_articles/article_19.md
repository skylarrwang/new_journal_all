in June. She cannot work, and though Anna plans to find a job 
when she turns 16 next month, their only source of income at the 
moment is welfare. 

Mary Anne's eldest child Ginger is 25 and slightly mentally 
retarded, or, in her mother's words, "slow." She lives in an institu-
tion down the road but comes home to visit regularly. Ginger calls 
Mary Anne "Mommy," and Mary Anne dotes on her. They were 
"hospital buddies" this summer, when Ginger had a shunt put in 
her liver. The shunt makes her constantly nauseated. As she shovels 
pancakes into her mouth, she suddenly gags. Mashed pancake bits, 
stuck in her teeth, threaten to explode out of her mouth. "Do you 
have to throw up, Ginger? Try to get to the coilet," her mother tells 
her. Still chewing, she turns towards the bathroom, pauses, and sits 
back down. "I'm okay." 

Today, if Ginger's feet don't hurt, they will walk co a local 
church soup kitchen, as they do on most Sunday afternoons. 
Sometimes they walk to Store 24, where the kids buy slurpees and 
Mary Anne relaxes with a cup of coffee. She hates going down there 
when she doesn't have money, "cause you can't buy anything and it's 
all there." Today she didn't have money for the New Haven Register, 
which Poppo reads to her. He looks through the classifieds for hous-
ing and a job for himself, since he just turned 18 and got his GED. 

Mary Anne was evicted from her last apartment, on Chapel 
Street in Fair Haven, when the building was condemned. Her 
apartment alone had 45 code violations, and the 82-year old land-
lord never touched the building. The family moved out less than 24 
hours after receiving an eviction notice and dragged their belong-
ings to a park. They stayed there all day, from 7 AM to 6 PM, until 
their social worker put them up in a motel. Anna had to leave 
behind two beloved cats and a guinea pig she had owned for four 
years. "She couldn't part with them. She was very depressed, and 
DCF made her leave them in the park," Mary Anne recalls. 

After their last apartment, the CCA shelter, with its back porch 
and open spaces, was a welcome relief Sometimes the churches 
down the street have services in Spanish, and Mary Anne likes to sit 
on the back porch and listen to the music. She is worried about her 
impending deadline, though. "The people are great, and I love 
being here, but I need to get my own apartment. I would take any-
thing right now. I'm pretty depressed," she says. Her blind eye is 
always watery, but now her good eye tears up as well. 

Both CCA and the city's social services agency are trying to help. 
"I have two good social workers on my side," she says; they are 
doing what they can. The OCF can make special arrangements to 
find her a voucher, but that may take months. Depending on cCA's 
assessment of the situation, Mary Anne may be granted an exten-
sion to stay two more weeks in the shelter.

New Haven has taken heat in recent 
weeks &om homeless advocates and pro-
testers camped out in the tent city on the 
New Haven Green for imposing 90-day 
length-of-stay requirements in city-run 
shelters. But family shelters have had cut-
off dates for years. "For individuals whose 
lives are unstable, sometimes in the shelter 
a complacency or a comfort level sets in," 
Bonita Grubbs, executive director of CCA, 
tells me. "The cut-off dates are not intend-
ed to be punitive. If we don't give them 
some benchmarks, they'd be perfectly con-
tent to stay here. There's no rent, no elec-
tricity or gas bills, none of the economic 
strains that come with renting an apart-
ment. This is a really comfortable environ-
ment where a family can catch ics breath." 

But Mary Anne needs to do m'ore than 
catch her breath. I mention the tenacity of 
the protesters on the Green; cold weather is . 
co·ming soon, I say, and they will still be 
out there. "I might be one of them," Mary 
Anne jokes. But then she laughs and waves 
the thought away.

CA PROVIDES 60-DAY temporary shel-
. ter for 17 families in buildings on 
Sylvan Avenue and Davenport 
Street. As family shelters in New Haven 
always are, these 17 CCA apartmentS are full. 
Shelter caseworkers turn away many more 
families than they are able to accept. Life 
Haven, Inc., a shelter for women and chil-
dren, turned down 28 families in August 
alone. The state has no legal obligation to 
provide for them. Unlike other state con-
stitutions-New York's, for example-
Connecticut's constitution does not guar-
antee the right to housing. The state's 
homeless population has risen significantly 
in the past year, and shelters are running 
out of resources. Most shelters in New 
Haven do receive money from the state, 
but they still have to stay on their toes. 

Earlier this summer, the state cut a chunk 
of itS social services budget, which includes 
shelter funding. At the last minute, some-
one discovered extra money and restored 
funds, but CCA was up to lose $2o,ooo. 

"This problem has been coming for 
awhile," says Grubbs. "In 1980 the state 
supported affordable housing to the rune of 
$125 million. Now it's like $5 million, and 
the freight train is going down the hill. I 
think we're going to be in this crunch for a 
while." 

Didi· makes .. 
sure her kids 
are fed. •I•m 
willing to 
eat dirt as 
long as they 
have eggs, • 
she vows. 

No one can defmitively explain the 
increase in homelessness. The factors over-
lap, forming a complex web of stories that 
eventually sound the same: they foreclosed 
on my apartment, slumlords let my build-
ing go to hell, minimum wage isn't enough 
for New Haven rentS, I can't find a job, I 
can't feed my kids and pay rent' too. And 
welfare reform, for its part, has knocked 
several thousand Connecticut families off 
the dole and onto the street in the past year 
alone. Many of them are tired of impos-
ing-dumping their kids on friends' 
couches, crashing at a brother's house. 

Unlike the city's single homeless popula-
tion, homeless families tend to be lifelong 
New Haven residentS. "Some families may 
never have been to a shelter before, but 
maybe they haven't had a permanent 
address in two years," explains Rachel 
Heerema, executive director of Life Haven. 

The phenomenon of the working 
homeless is more common than one might 
think. Jose, Didi's boyfriend, has had the 
same job for eight years but does not make 
nearly enough to provide for the nine peo-
ple his wages need to support. 18-year-old 
Michael lives with his mother, Valerie, 
down the hall from Didi at CCA. "You're 
not looking for a job. You're looking for a 
career," he says. "I don't see any moms over 
here with careers. I see moms working at 
Dunkin DonutS, Kentucky Fried Chicken 
-those are teenager jobs. They're busting 
their asses, doing it the best they can, but 
they can't keep up." 

Substance abuse preventS much of the 
single homeless population &om escaping 
their situation, but none of the parentS I 
met had a drug or alcohol problem. "With 
families, it's a different kettle of fish. 
ParentS have an amazing capacity to keep it 
together for their kids, and children are an 
incredible motivator," says Heerema. 

When addiction does become a problem, 
shelters call the state child welfare agency 
to intervene, and children are put in foster 
care. Parents then have to move out of the 
family shelter. But the incidence of addic-
tion is low among homeless families with 
children. The causes of their homelessness 
are much broader. 

When minimum wage won't pay the 
rent, people turn to the government. "The 
city bears the major responsibility to house 
ics own folks. Do they have the funds for 
that? Not really. Who does?" asks Grubbs. 

Grubbs is clearly frustrated with the city's 
impotence. "Maybe the dry's trying to do 
something about it with their initiativd. 
But my fear is, with aU the attemptS to sta-
bilize the dry, we might lose sight of indi-
viduals that are looked upon as a drain on 
the city's resources. Someone has to take 
care of them. What is being done to make 
living in this city affordable?" The homeless 
mothers I have met tend to lash out at the 
government in urgent, immediate anger. 

Mayor DeStefano's recent salary increase 
has been fodder for protesters on the 
Green. Grubbs, however, seems torn, 
TaE NEW JouRNAL 


24 SYLvAN AVENUE, where Didi's fami-
ly lives, is a nondescript building, 
across the street from an empty lot, with 
two security doors and a faded "No 
Loitering" sign. The block, littered with 
candy wrappers washed up from the sewer, 
is especially ugly on rainy days. Inside, 
apartment numbers are handwritten in 
permanent marker on sour green doors. 
The building hums with the sound of TV-
sets, hairdryers, and thumping hip-hop 
music. Downstairs, a bulletin board is cov-
ered with Christian inspirational messages, 
including a letter from Satan thanking 
readers for succumbing to his temptations. 

"Jennifer, let me do your hair," Didi 
calls. She begins to wrestle Jennifer's hair 
into a little afro puff-a long, difficult-
process that involves a lot of gel. Angel, 
Didi's oldest boy at II, lets out a whoop 
from the couch as he beats his younger 
brother AJ at a Sega game yet again. Didi 
calls Angel an "old soul." Under long eye-
lashes his brown eyes seem to be pondering 
measures of weighty importance. He has a 
collection of about 20 cos, all hip-hop, and 
spends every spare moment dancing to Ja 
Rule and Bubba Sparxx. Angel takes pride 
in running errands for his mom, bringing 
her the phone and borrowing eggs when 
she asks. When he thinks no one is looking, 
he combs back his hair with a pick he car-
ries in his pocket. 

Angel wants to be a "child doctor," 
like Benjamin Carson, whom he heard 
speak at Yale last year. Didi brags that AJ 
and Angel both get straight A's in school. AJ 
is visibly embarrassed and tells her he hates 
when she says that, but he smiles. Angel 
mentions several times that he reads at a 
ninth grade level. 

The amount of food this family con-
sumes is astonishing. AJ has made himself a 
sandwich with bologna, cheese, and the 
heel of a loaf of bread. Sandwich bread, 
among other things, disappears quickly in a 
family of nine. Didi lets Jubi sip from her 
coffee mug. "I need my coffee," she con-
fesses. In an apartment this chaotic, I can 
see why. "I tell people I have seven kids. 
Everybody asks me, 'Are you crazy?' But 
they keep me going," she says. 

Though he says none of his friends 
care that he lives in a homeless shelter, 
Angel hates staying at CCA. "The shelter 
sucks. It's annoying. There's no privacy," he 
says. But it is clean and well-maintained. 
Didi's last apartment was much like Mary 
Anne's. "I was living on the Boulevard in a 
three bedroo~ apartment. There's rats the 
size of raccoons in our apartment, and they 
see this, and they say it's liveable. Roaches 
crawling in your refrigerator. The judge 
said it's not worth it to be condemned, and 
there's much more they could be doing to 
that apartment. But the landlord's not 
doing anything! Why don't you take it 
away from him?" she asks, her voice rising 
in frustration. Didi fought with her land-
lord for four months and withheld rent 
until he threatened to evict her. Unable to 
find another apartment, she left on her 
own terms and moved in with her brother 
until she found space in a shelter. "The 
beautiful places, they're bOarded up. And if 
they're not, they want $1,500 for a 4 bed-
room. How are we going to afford that on 
a $6.50 an hour salary?" 

Didi and her family have lived at CCA 
since mid-August. She quit her job at 
Dunkin Donuts in March, when she went 
to court to gain custody of her sister's chil-
dren, who were destined for foster care. 
Ana, Tani, and Roy have lived with them 
since. Though Jose holds a steady job in 
landscaping, the economic strain of one 
less job in the family and three more 
mouths to feed was overwhelming. And 
now they have to find a home.
