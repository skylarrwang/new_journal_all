Can Alexander Garvin and 
his team of Yale graduates 
rebuild Lower M anhattan as 
the public envisions it? 
By Emily Lodish 
dent, the hat provides a name which sticks to Garvin as steadfastly 
as Yalies do. But the number of former Yale students Garvin 
employs stands in stark contrast to the corporation's democratic 
intentions. The LMDC was formed after September nth by Governor 
George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani "to oversee and coordinate 
the revitalization and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan south of 
Houston Street." A central factor in their mission is a commitment 
to an "open and inclusive public process." (Garvin would be sure to 
add dedication to skillful planning and innovative design. In his 
words, "This is New York. Nothing less is acceptable.") In fact, the 
future of Lower Manhattan seems not co rest in the hands of the 
public but in the laps of a hand-picked group of Ivy-Leaguers. Yet, 
while Garvin's reliance on his Yale connections may have under-
mined the project's initial mission, in the end it just might save it. 


T
HE ATrRACTION BETWEEN YALIES AND GARVIN IS MUTUAL: He 
can't stay away from them either. "Garvin insisted on continu-
ing his teaching when he cook on the Lower Manhattan project," 
said Yale college Dean Richard Brodhead, "and I'm pleased that he 
has found so much talent for this project in the Yale ranks." Garvin, 
who began teaching at Yale immediately after completing his third 
Yale degree--he graduated from Yale College in 1962 and received 
degrees in Architecture and Urban Studies in 1967-has not missed 
a year since. This year, even with his added involvement in the 
LMoc, has been no exception. 

Working with a familiar staff ofYalies, Garvin has created an 
extension of his classroom. "Thank God!" he exclaims, "New 
Yorkers are getting their money's worth, and more." Because his stu-
dents have learned firsthand from Garvin the inner workings of 
urban planning, Garvin does not have to train them on the job. As 
a result, the I.MOc runs efficiently. The Yale-laden infrastructure of 
the LMOC is as functional and well crafted as Garvin's vision for a 
list Century Manhattan. 

Garvin's students, in turn, are graceful for the exposure to the 
world of high-powered urban planning. Kelly remarks chat Garvin 
is an institution unto himself, and Smith calls him a "black hole of 
movers and shakers" in the urban planning world. The sheer num-
ber of people who are both "magically very powerful and successful 
in urban planning" and have an affiliation with Garvin boggles 
Smith's mind. And it is decidedly so: A colleague of Garvin's from 
the Yale School of Architecture, David Childs, is currently redesign-
ing the Art and Architecture building on the Yale campus. Childs, 
along with the designer of the new History of Art building, Richard 
Meier, is among six fmalists selected by the LMDC to participate in 
a design study of the World Trade Center site. 

While bringing Yale ro the LMDC is an effort of Garvin's that 
Smith characterizes as "very conscious," it is also one that Kelly feels 
is ultimately irrelevant. For her, the Yale connection just means 
Garvin knows what each employee is good at, and is able to orga-
nize tasks accordingly. For this reason, she feels she was given more 
responsibility this summer than she would have been given at 
another internship. It may seem that Garvin, by hiring his former 
students, has created an environment where his ideology is rarely 
challenged. Garvin counters without hesitation that he chooses 
only the best people for the job. 

In keeping with the LMDC's "open and inclusive" approach, the 
community does have a great deal to say about the goings-on in 
Lower Manhattan. "My fellow citizens want their city back, and 
they want it back now," Garvin says. Thanks to the LMDC 's website, 
where the public continues co register thousands of comments, and 
to an ongoing process of public hearings, Garvin and his colleagues 
at the LMDC receive constant feedback. Finally able to participate in 
the redevelopment process, however, the public found they could 
only respond to plans that had already been conceived. At times, 
the community's ideas have departed radically from the six conser-
vative models presented in the LMoc's Preliminary Urban D~sign 
Study, suggesting that public comment 
should have been solicited earlier in the 
process. 

A common criticism was the general 
lack of innovation and boldness in the 
designs. Among the dissenting voices was 
The New York Timels architecture critic 
Herbert Muschamp, who wrote in July that 
"as a starting point for public discussion, 
the plans have little to recommend them." 
Muschamp criticized the LMDC itself for its 
"breathtaking determination to think 
small." Even Eastwood, who helped pro-
duce the study, identifies with this disap-
proval. "Putting out four of the first six 
plans hurt my heart," he says. Smith agrees, 
and goes on to say that the LMDC needed to 
tread lightly in its conception of the first six 
plans, since accommodating all the partici-
pating interests seemed nearly impossible. 

Some, like Smith, think building the tallest 
building in the world would be the best 
approach to redevelopment; others want 
the footprints of the Twin Towers left 
untouched. Garvin certainly recognizes the 
variety of players with a stake in the rede-
velopment process-not only those with 
significant financial interests, the list of 
which is long and varied, but also members 
of the public. "They have a great deal to say 
about where we go," Garvin says, "Is it 
bolder designs? We bring them bolder 
designs. Is it something in the skyline? We 
get them something in the skyline." Garvin 
understands that there would have been 
criticism no matter what was first put on 
the table. "This is New York, that's what 
you do." 

While staffers like Eastwood note the 
initial sting of negative criticism, Rubin 
reiterates that the LMoc's all-inclusive plan-
ning process "is the right thing to do ... If 
we received only one great idea from pub-
lic input that would not have otherwise 
been realized in closed-door sessions, then 
it was all worth it." Garvin adds, "Serious 
citizen participation in planning is essen-
tial. . .. The trouble is that democracy is a 
messy business. It takes time and patience." 
He yields (a rare oc<;urrence) to Churchill: 
"Democracy is the worst forni of govern- :1 
ment--o:cept 
for 
all 
the 
others." 

Nonetheless, the feedback Rubin and 
Garvin discuss came after the plans had 
already been conceived. The public could 
only resp2nd to these final proposals. 

Garvin takes the recent criticism in 
stride, however, exhibiting a buoyancy that 
Kelly describes as "resilient" and "opti-
mistic." This outlook, which may yet 
restore integrity to the project's democratic 
intentions, Garvin ironically attributes to 
his years in the Ivory Tower. It was at Yale 
that he feels he developed a "willingness to 
listen to people who think differently than 
myself, to argue and to disagree, but to 
value what they had to say as something 
that might be as valid as what I have to 
say." And listen he did when he heard that 
designs weren't inventive enough. "We 
hired half a dozen new design teams," 
Garvin says, "who are going to provide, I 
hope, some of that boldness." In light of 
this, even Muschamp seems to have backed 
off from his earlier, harsher remarks. He 
wrote on October 1, "If the public keeps its 
eye on the ball, 
the Development 
Corporation's latest effort could change the 
course of cultural life in New York." That is 
precisely what Garvin intends to do. 

He envisions a 21St century downtown 
where people not only work, but also live 
and hang out, and the market-driven poli-
cies he advocates support this. He adheres 
to this philosophy because it works; he is 
not interested in idealistic or utopian 
visions. Understandably, on this front, 
there is little dissent from his former stu-
dents now at the LMOC. As Eastwood says, 
•planning involves the real, the possible, 
not the utopian." 

Similarly, Garvin's genius, which lies 
in combining architecture and planning, 
presupposes "a rejection of utopian dreams 
and the insistence of looking at daily life in 
neighborhoods." Garvin draws a stark line 
between his two disciplines, saying, "Great 
architecture has nothing to do with plan-
ning." He promised early on that there 
would be great architecture on the World 
Trade Center site, but "planning," he says, 
•is a completely different function." The 
distinction between the two is one which 
he believes is often unappreciated by the 
public and the press. "The public demands 
great architecture," he says. New Yorkers 
clamor to have their skyline repaired. They 
want tangible and immediate evidence of 
progress. But, in urban planning, progress 
happens over the course of time, in com-
plex stages that are decidedly less immedi-
ate. It is here diat Garvin's dual lines of 
work reinforce one another. He takes care 
of what people don't know they need in 
order to give them what they want. He has 
taught his students to do the same. As 
Rubin says, "Especially with the monu-
mental task ahead of us with the World 
Trade Center sire, planning and design 
need to exist hand in hand." 

S
ITIING IN HIS OPPICB, Garvin recalls 
his high school prom in New York. At 
two in the morning, he stood at the base of 
the Seagram Building on Park Avenue, 
looking up at 38 floors advancing skyward, 
absolutely straight. This was the building 
that most impressed Garvin. Reminiscent 
of the Twin Towers, the Seagram Building 
is a glass-covered, high-rise office building 
in midtown Manhattan. "Wow," Garvin 
remembers thinking, "How could some-
body do that?" 

Today, Garvin can imagine people 
looking at what he does, at the level of 
responsibility he carries on a daily basis, 
and asking a similar question. For Garvin, 
though, it is just what he does. He must 
fulfill his duty to his fellow citizens, who 
"aren't going to tolerate waiting around 
until there is a consensus," he says. But like 
the Seagram Building, which was three 
decades in the making, rebuilding Lower 
Manhattan will take time. And now Garvin 
faces further delays which could have been 
avoided by soliciting public comment ear-
lier. Still, he moves forward with confi-
dence. Once completed, the Seagram 
Building was an instant classic. Garvin 
believes that another wiJI rise out of Lower 
Manhattan.
