Passed along like this, the recruitment 
line was retooled for the recipient every 
time it was uttered. 


The night before the event, the 
Reverend Scott Marks, a prominent figure 
among labor leaders and the activist clergy, 
held a sort of prayer meeting for students 
in the heart ofYale's campus. Marks is built 
like a linebacker, speaks in the cadence of 
an old-time preacher, and once justified his 
political involvement to me by bellowing, 
"I am a stickler for prayer and worship, but 
when you're done praying, you have to get 
off your knees." But that night, with fifty 
Yale students crowded around him under 
the lights of C ross Campus, he ended his 
pleading and sermonizing with a hollow 
appeal to self-interest: "You are not doing 
this for the people of New Haven. You are 
doing this for yourselves." 


B
y THE NEXT MORNING, alJ the elements 
were in place. The unions had the sig-
natures of some 700 people, from all camps 
and all backgrounds, committed to being 
arrested. The police department, working 
closely with union organizers, had devised 
a fail-safe plan to ensure that everything 
lVent smoothly. T he media, of course, was 
alerted. 


With such perfect orchesuation, the 
event went off without a hitch. Hundreds 
0croBER 2002 
carne to witness, hundreds to paroc1pate. 
Linked arm in arm, they were a microcosm 
of the New Haven commwliry and reflect-
ed the incongruous alliance that makes up 
the local labor movement. The line includ-
ed not only union workers but also 200 
GESO members, 65 undergraduates, 35 cler-
gymen, four aldermen, and three State 
Representatives. Photographers and jour-
nalists swarmed around them. A squadron 
of New Haven police officers had prepared 
the scene earlier that afternoon. They had 
readied barricades to redirect uaffic when 
the arrest line crossed the busy intersection 
of College and Elm Sueets. As the 675 par-
ticipants filed across the Green, Andrea 
Cole, an organizer for Local 34, soberly 
directed the crowd of witnesses as if recit-
ing a dialing menu on an automated 
answering service: "I need you to listen 
very carefully to these insuuctions. We are 
asking every person to maintain order and 
respect." After the participants were 
warned by the police and then arrested, 
they lined up to collect their citations at 
tables that had been set up beforehand. 
The cops thanked union leaders for coop-
erating so well. "We couldn't have asked for 
a better time. Everything went very 
smoothly and everyone was very helpful," 
said one department spokesman. 


All had gone according to plan. But 
the next day, press accounts focused largely 
on the orchesuation of the event, foregoing 
any substantive discussion of the underly-
ing issues for accounts of its overt theatri-
cality and barely veiled criticisms of its flat 
tone. Labor leaders must have reacted with 
some dismay when The New 10rk Times 
scoffed, "the two-hour spectacle ... looked 
like a cross between a voter regisuation 
drive and an arts-and-crafts fair." 


T
HREE YEARS AGO, Yale's lefr-wing com-
munity was convulsing over another, 
more distant cause: the use of sweatshop 
labor in Cenual America and Southeast 
Asia to manufacture Yale clothing. In the 
debate over what course of action to fol-
low-more protests, a mass public arrest, a 
hostile take-over of an administration 
building (as Harvard living wage activists 
did last year, generating a month-long 
national media frenzy}-the fall of 2002 
became a central concern. Even then, those 
in the know were anticipating a serious 
showdown 
over 
labor issues-which 
would, naturally, demand impassioned 
involvement by committed students. 


"Don't go and get arrested now," one savvy 
veteran of the activist scene cold me 
somberly. "You have to save yourself for 
2002, when the conuacts are up. That's 
when shit will really get crazy." 


This divide-and-conquer 
strategy misses one thing: 
The alliance is as much 
pragmatic as it is ideological. 
As recently as last spring, however, 
both union leaders and the Yale adminis-
tration were heralding a new era in labor 
relations at the University. 


In his 
Tercentennial address a year ago, President 
Levin effectively staked his legacy as a New 
Haven visionary on the outcome of negoti-
ations: 

In the years ahead, I hope that we 
can achieve the sacne kind of 
progress with our labor ·unions, 
whose members make an essential 
and valuable contribution to ·the 
life of the University. We are eager 
to work with Locals 34 and 35 to 
find a new way of structuring our 
relationship, relying on day-to-
day collaboration rather than 
periodic confrontation. Just as 
our work with the city of New 
Haven required participants on 
both sides of the town-gown 
divide to cast aside long-held 
prejudices, working collaborative-
ly with our unions will require 
participants on both sides to over-
come years of distrust. 

While the gulf between the union and 
administration on issues like GESO and the 
hospital workers was obvious to anyone 
who looked beyond the fulsome head-
lines--one organizer referred to it as a 
"media love fest" -union leaders look back 
on that time as one of sincere hope. 


"People really expected something when 
President Levin talked about collaboration 
and change," Chernoff said. 


But Locals 34 and 35 had also learned 
some crucial lessons since the last time the 
labor battle flared up, with a brutal two-
month strike in 1996. Now, union leaders 
look back on that action as largely a failure. 
They ceded to the administration the right 
to sub-contract jobs in new buildings, 
which would have otherwise gone to union 
members. A year later, when Levin 
announced the start of a capital campaign 
and one of the most ambitious building 
sprees in the University's historf, union 
leaders 
felt 
they'd 
been 
tricked. 


Subcontracting embodies the greatest 
threat to the survival of unions: irrelevance. 
On a national level, organized labor has 
struggled to adapt to an economy in which 
service jobs outnumber those in tradition-
ally unionized industries, and union mem-
bership has plummeted to 13% of the 
workforce. At Yale, the administration's 
decision to subcontract directly under-
mined the leadership and negotiating 
power of Locals 34 and 35 by slowly starv-
ing them of members. 


Taking up the cause of graduate stu-
dents and hospital workers, therefore, fit 
into a deeply pragmatic calculation: If suc-
cessful, the organizing drive would increase 
union membership at the University from 
4 ,000 to 8,ooo. "The secret's out: The 
unions want to grow," Chernoff explained. 
"We can do things better when we repre-
sent more people." Yale, meanwhile, has 
refused even to engage negotiators from 34 
and 35 in a dialogue about GESO and II99, 
issues that they dismiss as immaterial to 
bargaining. In the case of the hospital, the 
University has long disavowed an actual 
institutional connection-despite the fact 
that President Levin sits on the hospital's 
board and has the power to appoint several 
of his fellow board members-and has said 
that it has no jurisdiction over the hospi-
tal's union-bashing administrators. Work 
floor managers at the hospital are notorious 
among workers for their chilling intimida-
tion tactics: "You come out of there scared 
shitless," one employee told me. Last 
month, eight people, including two Yale 
graduate students, were arrested while 
leafleting in front of the building. Yale 
administrators have also resisted GESo's 
attempt to gain formal recognition. In their 
most recent move, they have suggested 
holding a National Labor Relations Board 
election while acknowledging that they 
would forestall a final decision through 
years of lengthy appeals. Since the alliance 
between these aggrieved groups and the 
established Yale unions started taking 
shape, the administration has repeated to 
the 4,000 members of Locals 34 and 35, as 
University spokesman Thomas Conroy did 
again after 
the arrests, "What the 
University hopes is that the Yale unions' 
support for other unions that are trying to 
organize workers does not delay contracts 
for Yale employees." This divide-and-con-
quer strategy, however, misses one thing: 
that the alliance is as much pragmatic as it 
is ideological. 


E
ARLY THIS YEAR, the unions and the 
administration jointly hired John 
Stepp, a labor consultant who served 
in the Department of Labor under 
President Reagan, to make negotiations 
more productive and more personable. 
Stepp's goal was to make each side better 
understand the "feelings" of the other, so 
that bargaining would include more of a 
"non-traditional, problem-solving process" 
and less bickering. He conducted some 100 
interviews with everyone from rank-and-
file union members and University middle 
managers to President Levin and New 
Haven Mayor John DeStefano. The con-
sultant-speak report that emerged was 
deeply damning of Levin and the Yale 
negotiating team, which soon relieved 
Stepp of his services. It delineates "a highlY 
adversarial and dysfunctional relationship.! 
non-productive at its best, but ofteD 
destructive, and ultimately, demoralizing 
for both union and management." It is dot· 
ted w~th phrases like "caste system: 
"underclass," "union ghetto," and "disdaiD · 
for working people." 


At the end, Stepp lays out a set of bul-
let-pointed recommendations. First, the 
University must understand "the union's 
long-term need to grow its business" -in 
uanslation, it must come to terms with the 
expansion of unions to previously unorga-
nized communities, like graduate students 
and hospital workers. It also calls for "a 
profound change in the way the University 
manages irs non-academic workforce and 
the union's role in representing it." After 
sounding the call for this "profound 
change," the report ends on an ominous 
note: "If the next bargaining round were 
conducted in a traditional manner ... a 
great opportunity would be missed and the 
residual negative climate would make the 
launch of a new relationship highly unlike-
ly." 


As negotiations break down into 
squabbling over percentage pointS and pen-
sion numbers refined to meaningless 
abstraction, union leaders talk more and 
more about this "profound change." 
·union members came to the bargaining 
table with the expectation that there would 
be some fundamental change," said 
Chernoff. "That has nothing to do with x 
and Y percent. We want to be looked at as 
assets, not just numbers." I asked Chernoff 
to explain in concrete terms what this fun-
damental change might look like. She 
offered a few case-specific examples-
training time for clerical workers, advance-
ment opportunities for the custodial 
staff-but then ironically slipped into the 
same platitudes that Levin continues to 
express in his public statementS on Locals 
34 and 35, mentioning "partnership" and 
"collaboration." Finally, she concluded, "I 
don't know how possible it is to do that." 


But then a few minutes later, she back-
tracked. "Actually, this is what it is: the 
University accepting that there's nothing 
fundamentally different about workers 
from any other segment of the communi-
ty." 


The University's official recognition of 
GI!SO and 1199 is inseparable from basic 
respect for irs employees as equal members 
of the University community. If the admin-
istration were truly serious about a partner-
ship with irs workers, union leaders ask, 
why would they so underhandedly try to 
derail every n~ effort to organize? "Yale 
has never committed co making people 
who devote their life to working here fed 
OcroBER 2002 
trained and respected," Andrea Cole 
charged in the week after the mass arrest, as 
negotiations plodded along in typical fash-
ion. "Once they decide to sit down and talk 
in a real way, I have no doubt we ~n make 
progress. But up until now, they haven't 
been serious about talking at aU." But Yale, 
after the arrests more than ever, has empha-
sized irs adherence to business as usual. As 
Conroy said, "We think that the focus 
should be on the bargaining table, and now 
that the demonstration has been held ... 
we can get back to business and continue 
negotiating." But when I asked Conroy if a 
strike can be averted, he hesitated and 
tepidly responded, "There's still some 
hope. There's certainly some." Locals 34 
and 35, for their part, along with members 
of GESO and organized hospital workers, 
have voted to authorize a strike--a decision 
that will likely go into effect this fall if this 
round of talks fizzles. 


Before the mass arrest, union organiz-
ers offered a range of purposes for the 
event. First, they highlighted the need to 
make the Yale administration listen to a 
point "that they were just not hearing." 
This point was often cast in terms of union 
expansion and uaining opportunities, but 
had more to do with the murky concept of 
"fundamental change." In the weeks since, 
union leaders seem to have recognized their 
failure to get this message across. But the 
more cenual purpose of the event may have 
been internal, and may explain why union 
leaders have convinced at least themselves 
that the bad press and dismissive attirudes 
in the wider community do not matter. 


"We have learned not to focus on what the 
media says," Cole said. Instead, she point-
ed to the effect on union members them-
selves. "It's strengthened the conviction of 
those who participated. They did some-
thing they were aftaid of, and they came 
through on the other side. That's very pow-
erful." At the moment when 675 people 
linked arms on College Street, the most 
important point may have gone unstated: 
The unions are ready for a strike.
