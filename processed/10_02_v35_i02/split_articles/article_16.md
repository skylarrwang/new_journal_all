ON A BRIGHT SATURDAY AFTERNOON, I find 
my way to the Educational Center for the 
Arts and stand in the doorway ready co 
watch the free tango session offered as a 
part of its quiet reopening celebration. 

Several people mill around, but no one 
makes eye contact. The only person in the 
room, a man with two large tufts of beard 
growing down from either side of his chin, 
notices the awkward crowd and walks 
toward che door. He claps his hands and 
smiles. 

"Come 
into 
ballroom. 
Welcome. I am Willie." We all smile shyly 
and step in. I wouldn't call this a "ball-
room," but I'm glad Willie does. The after-
noon light casts pink and yellow rectangles 
on the black dance floor through arc-deco 
stained glass windows. There is something 
hushed about the room, the students, the 
pre-class atmosphere. Then Willie pushes a 
button and lush tango music fills the cav-
ernous room. 

"Lee's start," Willie says, surveying us. 
"Can everyone please find a parmer?" The 
pre-class eye aversion is no longer accept-
able. To my lefr is a pot-bellied man in his 
thirties who, with his baseball shire and 
torn jeans, would look infinitely more at 
home in a sports bar. The man to my right 
is young and well above six feet tall. His 
gende smile surprises me as he offers me his 
arm. 

WJlie instructs us to walk with our 
partners in beat to the music. I would have 
to crane my neck to make eye contact with 
my partner, so instead I stare ac his torso. 
He smells slighdy of sweat, but for some 
reason it doesn't bother me. Perhaps it's 
something about the small cimid steps he 
takes, and the frequency with which he 
clips my toes. Then Willie calls ouc that we 
muse switch partners. 

Now I find myself next to a chubby 
litde boy wearing an over-sized collared c-
shirt with a large stain in the middle. He 
won't make eye contact with me. "What's 
your name?" I ask, smiling. He mumbles 
his name; I still have no idea what ic is. 
"I'll lead, okay?" The boy nods. The 
music starts up again. I notice that my 
young partner has begun co stare at me in 
dumb &scination as he shuffies rhythrrJess-
ly along the dance floor. Feeling slighdy 
awkward, I decide to make conversation 
with him in order ro break his penetrating

stare. My attempts are met with monosyl-
labic answers, and I stop trying. The stare 
continues. I get used co it, and even scare to 
find it charming. 

My partner for the double-time exer-
cise is Susan, Willy's assistant. She wears a 
red dress with large purple Hawaiian flow-
ers and smiles at me without showing her 
teeth. She is straight-spined and tense-
limbed. I like dancing with her; she is very 
certain abouc each seep. I glance toward the 
door and notice a small crowd hovering 
there, watching us. I sense that all the other 
tango students feel the same smugness I 
do--no hovering in the doorway for us. 
We're on che dance floor. 

And stay we do, through all of the for-
ward and backward and double time exer-
cises. Suddenly ic's the last dance, and I'm 
back with my firsc partner. The music starts 
up again. AH of the couples move counter-
clockwise. Halfway through the song I can 
feel that the cwo of us have found the 
rhythm. He's noc taking those ciny steps 
anymore. We are together, striding in 
rhythm. After a moment we lose the beat, 
and he seeps on my roes. 

When the song ends, everyone stands 
in a circle, looking openly at one another. 
Willy thanks us, claps his hands, and dis-
misses the one and only free afternoon 
tango class. I consider sticking around and 
talking to my fellow students, but some-
how I can't bring myself to stay. Walking 
quickly down the staircase, I realize that it's 
because I want them tO remain exacdy 
what they have been for the past hour: 
strangers who are willing to spend a bright 
Saturday afrernoon learning how to look 
other strangers straight in the eye. 


**Title: Blunder Bus**

"I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A BUS 
BEFORE!" said the red-haired 
toddler seated across from me. 
He got up and sat down again 
on the wooden bench in excite-
ment. "It's your first trolley 
ride," corrected his companion, 
a srout black woman. She 
dabbed her forehead with a 
handkerchief. But the toddler 
was right. Though the machine 
has the name and visage of a trolley, com-
plete with red and green old-time shell and 
clanging bell, its heart is an electric hybrid 
bus, built especially for the New Haven 
Trolley Line by the EBus Corporation of 
California. 

Mayor John DeStefano Jr. opened the 
Trolley Line this summer to surreal fanfare. 
At the opening ceremony, DeStefano 
announced, "The charge is not ten dollars, 
its not five dollars , its not even one dollar. 
It's ... " At this point he opened his arms to 
a crowd of city, business, and arts commu-
nity officials. O n cue, they all yelled, 
"Free!" 

Well, not quite. This year's great white 
elephant was funded by $2.50,000 from the 
Transportation and Community Systems 
Preservation Pilot Program, $x,ooo,ooo 
from 
Federal 
Transportation 
Administration Bus Program, and approxi-
mately $2.50,000 from the New Haven 
community, including the Greater New 
Haven Clean Cities Coalition. And when 
the federal money for the "preserved trol-
leys" begins to run dry, New Haven will 
have to turn to the trolley's passengers to 
foot the bill. 

The boy, his guardian, the conductor, 
and I were the orJy passengers on the trol-
ley that Saturday afrernoon. We were on 
the financial leg of the trolley's route, a 
loop that demarcates downtown New 
Haven: up Whimey to Orange and State, 
up Chapel, then down York, Elm, and back 
to Whitney. 

"Those buildings have lots of squares!" 
The boy pointed over my shoulder at the 
banks on Whitney. "Oh, yes. Buildings do 
have lots of squares," replied the old lady 
dreamily. "I am so glad we took this trolley. 
We're so tired and it'll take us home. A free
