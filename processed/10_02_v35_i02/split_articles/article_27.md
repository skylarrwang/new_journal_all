EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
IN THE DAYS BEFORE 675 PEOPLE WERE 
arrested on College Street, New Haven's 
labor unions prepared for action. At the 
First Methodist Church, 100 students, 
workers, and interested community mem-
bers listened ro the instructions of Steve 
Thornton. Thornton is a veteran national 
labor activist who calls himself a "non-vio-
lent direct action civil disobedience orga-
nizer." This means that he trains people to 
get arrested for the cause as quickly, pain-
lessly, and effectively as possible. His tone 
was curt as he reeled off advice: wear com-
fortable shoes and eat something before-
hand, since "getting arrested might be a 
time commitment." Meanwhile, a handful 
of union employees distributed "pre-arrest 
cards." Committed arrestees, they instruct-
ed, should submit their names, addresses, 
dates of birth, and social security numbers 
to the New Haven Police Department 
before the mass arrest. That way, the cops 
could pre-prim tickets and distribute them 
efficiently. With careful planning, they 
could make a forceful but orderly point. 

The group broke into drills. They 
lined up in "hassle lines," with half the
group in arrest formation-arms linked in 
a long chain-while the other half acted 
like hecklers. Then roles reversed. This 
time, instead of hecklers, participants were 
supposed ro impersonate journalists, asking 
"hard questions about why they're out 
doing what they're doing." With any luck, 
their answers might in a few days end up 
on the from page of The New J0rk Times. 
Union 
headquarters, 
meanwhile, 
buzzed with activity. Organizers shouted 
into phones over the drone of copy 
machines running overtime to produce 
recruitment materials for potencial arrestees 
and pamphlets for the hundreds of witness-
es expected to show up for Wednesday's 
event. The conversations consisted mostly 
of gentle persuasion. "Getting arrested will 
be a fine experience," an organizer 
explained. "Fill out the card and the cops 
will have a ticket right there waiting for 
you. There's a fine of $30 or $40" -it 
turned out to be $88-"but you can do, 
like, eight hours of community service 
instead, and we're also selling t-shirts to set 
up a fund for people who can't pay." 
Periodically, someone stood up waving a 
stack of papers and yelled victoriously, "I 
got another committed" -moving closer, 
signature-by-signature, towards their pro-
fessed goal of orchestrating "the biggest 
civil disobedience since civil rights." 

Around New Haven, similar conversa-
tions were taking place in churches, com-
munity centers, coffee shops, and class-
rooms. I was riding with one organizer as 
he sped between T hornton's training ses-
sion and a prayer meeting at a local church, 
where labor activist preachers were invok-
ing the light of the divine to boost numbers 
on the arrest tally. Every few minutes, a col-
league checked in via cell phone to give an 
update or announce another small victory. 
20 people came forward in a rousing "altar 
call" at a Fair Haven church; at another 
church, a man had come to a prayer meet-
ing just to watch but "was so moved by the 
spirit there" that he signed a pre-arrest card 
before he left. 

One union organizer summed up the 
hopes for the event to me with a sly pitch: 
"You know, this is the one time when your 
body being on the right side of the line 
makes a huge difference. The possibility of


A NO so WENT THE RECRUITING LINE: 
#-\AFter months of increasingly acrimo-
nious-and, by this point, stagnated-
negotiations between the Yale administra-
tion and Locals 34 and 35, the unions that 
represent the University's clerical and 
maintenance staff, the labor community 
needed to send a stronger message to the 
administration in hope of breaking an 
apparent 
deadlock 
and 
avoiding 
a 
University-wide strike. While University 
spokesmen had uttered their typical line 
about the continuing progress of bargain-
ing, union leaders had grown pessimistic. 
Their demands, it seemed, just weren't get-
ting through to the administration; they 
needed some new way to communicate if 
negotiations were to continue. 

Recent media attention had focused 
on the negotiators' inability to reach an 
agreement on bread-and-butter issues, but 
the more fundamental, and more nebu-
lous, concerns of the unions had not even 
been addressed, especially the organizing 
rights ofYale graduate students and work-
ers at Yale-New Haven Hospital. District 
1199 of the Service Employees International 
Union and the Graduate Employees and 
30 
Students Organi~tion (GESO) are working 
to unionize hospital workers and graduate 
student teaching assistants respectively, and 
have united with Locals 34 and 35 under 
the Federation of Hospital and University 
Employees. Each is demanding that its 
employer accept what is known as card-
check neutrality-impartiality in the orga-
nizing stages and official recognition once 
more than half of each workforce has 
signed cards expressing solidarity with the 
union. Both 1199 and GESO report that 
more than 6o% of their workforces have 
signed such cards. For months, Locals 34 
and 35 have made the University's accep-
tance of these signatures a basic condition 
for the signing of a new contract-an alle-
giance that is surprising to many given the 
disparate characters that make up the four 
groups. 

The recognition of these groups as 
unions is not the only sticking point in 
talks. To Locals 34 and 35, however, Yale's 
stubbornness on this front reflects its gener-
al inability to see the need for a "funda-
mental change" in its relationship with its 
employees. "The situation with GESO and 
the hospital cuts to the heart of how Yale 
thinks of and treats people who work here," 
union spokeswoman Deborah Chernoff 
said. "If you take away the hoopla, GESO 
and hospital workers are just saying to Yale, 
'Let's sit down and have a real talk.' That's 
really what we're all saying." 

In September, Yale President Richard 
Levin distributed a letter to the communi-
ty that criticized unions for their con-
frontational stance and tendency to "demo-
nize" Yale. For many union organizers, 
Levin's harsh new tone signified that an 
amicable outcome to negotiations was all 
but impossible. So they set a date: 
September 25. That day, provided no con-
tract had yet been signed, union forces 
would mobilize for a mass arrest. 

From that point on, recruitment was 
frantic and planning was meticulous. 
Having inflated the public's expectations, 
organizers h ad to ensure that the actual 
numbers 
would 
back 
them 
up. 
Originating with the central committee, 
union networks extend like tentacles into 
every segment of the Yale community. 
When lead organizers first announced the 
action, the message traveled to unionized 
clerical and maintenance employees, hos-
pital workers, embattled graduate stu-
dents, the clergy, local politicians, and 
activist undergraduates at a remarkable 
pace. The strategy was to work through 
existing relationships: a history graduate 
student would approach another history 
graduate student, a minister would 
preach politics to his congregation.
