Appraise and Fall 
IT HAS STOOD through years of KISS con-
certs, third-rate minor league hockey 
matches, and the debacles of Yale basket-
ball-but for the first time ever, one day 
this fall, the main attraction at the New 
Haven Coliseum was the ill-fated Coliseum 
itself. The concrete and steel monstrosity 
was transformed into a hammed-up flea 
market, and everything, bolted down or 
not, was on sale. 

To 
visualize 
the scope of the 
Coliseum's liquidation, imagine a behe-
moth grocery store. Replace the cereal 
boxes and soda cans with the turnstiles and 
popcorn machines of a professional sports 
arena. Instead of Wonderbread, row upon 
row of industrial-sized nacho cheese mak-
ers and two ten-foot tall Zambonis Hne the 
double-wide aisles thronged with crazed 
bargain hunters. Only one man, a fast talk-
er in a suit coat, could make sense of it all: 
Welcome to a glorious junkyard auction. 

"HEY and twenty-now-twenty-now-
twenty-now-thirty-do I have thirty-now-
.thirty-now-thirty-HEY! This is a fine piece 
of equipment folks .... Ifi owned a restau-
rant I'd buy it myself!" His motorized char-
iot glided down the aisles, pausing beside 
each token of the Coliseum's bygone 
grandeur in its turn. He and his assistant 
coaxed offers from the crowd with a steady 
stream of coddling and cajoling: A 
4 
Volkswagen-sized Hobart eight-slicer-
"Come on! Everybody needs one!" 

Hands shot up and down so quickly 
that I could hardly tell who was bidding, 
much less against whom or at what stakes. 
Shouts of: "hip! Hip! HIP!" acknowledged 
the bids. Some of the hipped were local 
business owners, others had come from as 
far away as Minnesota to outfit their ice 
rinks, and still others were just hoping to 
pick up a cheap television or computer and 
turn a quick profit on eBay. It was capital-
ism, unsheathed and unadorned. 

Local business owner Robert Neubig 
saw not only hockey goals, deep fryers, cash 
registers, forklifts, and Choc-0-Jet hot 
chocolate makers, but fabulous opportuni-
ty as well. Two hours into the auction, he 
had already bought a nacho cheese dis-
penser for his 13-year old son-"He loves 
nachos!" -and a massive metal hot dog 
warmer to take to church picnics. "This is 
the ultimate wholesale," he said emphati-
cally. "Write that down: the ultimate 
wholesale." Of course, he conceded merri-
ly, it is a bit risky. The skill lies in learning 
to navigate the choppy waters between 
Treasure Island and the Bermuda Triangle. 
"Some people go to the casino. This is how 
I get my fix; this is my gambling." Even his 
wife was forewarned that with her husband 
would come his auction addiction-some-
times indulged several times a month-and 
an old dairy barn's worth of prize finds. 

As an infidel among auction-believers, 
though, I had to mention my amused skep-
ticism. Robert would have none of it. "Do 
you have a hot dog maker?" he demanded. 
I quickly double-checked my backpack 
before admitting I did not. "Do you know 
anyone who has a hot dog maker? Well, 
now I have one. So I have the opportunity 
to help out." 

Auctions, Robert reflected, are a way 
of life. But not everyone checking out the 
siding on industrial strength cookware was 
so philosophical. Jim and Laurie Burwell of 
West Haven stopped by to see how they 
could .better outfit their Little League con-
cession business. Pumping cheese onto 
nachos by hand and keeping coffee water 
hot in a crock pot can get to you after a 
while. "This will definitely be easier." 

Easier, said the owners of the Connecticut 
Sports Complex in North Branford, if any 
of your new equipment actually functions 
once you get it home. "People don't realize 
a lot of this stuff is useless. It's really taken 
a beating." 

The silver-tongued auctioneer taking 
bids on whole sections of stadium seats 
could overlook such minor derails, howev-
er. The company charged with extracting a 
fmal profit &om the Coliseum would slap a 
tag on anything in the building that was 
worth hauling out, and much that wasn't. 

It was a strange scene, to say the 
least-which might explain why, as a first-
time security guard named Max observed 
in annoyance, "Everyone's got to touch 
everything." The day after the auction, one 
man was indignant upon discovering that 
the dolleys he had bought were being used 
by other buyers to gather up their own new 
treasures. Another proud purchaser gave a 
dry snort of amusement when reminded 
that he had purchased only the paper 
advertising the Sports Haven athletic goods 
store. Someone else had dibs on the frame 
and glass. Both the Zambonis had sold 
without incident, one for $6ooo. All four 
scoreboards went, as well as the floodlights 
on the ceiling and the illuminated 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


Coliseum advertisement visible from the 
freeway. 

Who made off with that thing, and for 
what purpose? The Thomas Auction 
Company does not name names, but one 
official offered this reassurance: "For the 
guy who bought it, it was a good price." 

So it went at the auction, where nacho 
cheese makers fetched $85 and the city, like 
its landmarks, was deconstructed but not 
destroyed, its refuse given a new lease on 
life. 

The inevitable nostalgia did not last 
long. Even a 13-year veteran Coliseum 
employee refused to lament the building's 
passing. "I try in life to cry as little as pos-
sible," he said, directing newcomers to the 
back offices and equipment rooms where 
their new possessions awaited them. 
"Everything's got to end sometime." And 
the cycle, as always, begins anew: The man 
who paid $6ooo for the Zamboni has 
already offered its old driver a job at his 
rink.
