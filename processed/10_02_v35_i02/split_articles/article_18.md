Mark Davis is Warren and Katharine Schlinger Professor of Chemical Engineering 
and Executive Officer of the Department of Chemical Engineering, California 
Institute of Technology. Both his undergraduate and graduate degrees are in 
chemical engineering and from the University of Kentucky where he was award-
ed a Ph.D in 1981. He is widely published in the areas of zeolite and molecular 
sieve synthesis and catalytic application and is currently investigating new mate-
rials for drug delivery. His research accomplishments have been recognized by 
many awards, including the first award to an engineer of the NSF-Alan T. 
Waterman Award, and a number of distinguished university lectureships, five in 
2002 alone at University of Colorado, Boulder; University of California, Berkeley; 
University of Notre Dame; Purdue University; and Carnegie Mellon University. 
Professor Davis is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. 
Traditionally, small molecule drugs have been derived from natural products 
(plants, microbes. and marine organisms). With the explosion of genetic informa-
tion. the creation of nucleic-acid based therapeutics is now advancing at a rapid 
pace. These so-called gene therapies translate knowledge acquired on the genet-
ic bases of diseases into treatments for humans. Unlike small molecule drugs 
that can passively move into and throughout cells, macromolecular therapeutics 
must actively be transported. With nucleic-acid-based drugs, the active transport 
involves penetration into the cell and movement to the nucleus. These demands 
take drug delivery to new heights by now requiring not only control of the level 
and location of the drug within the body, but also intracellular trafficking to a 
specified sub-cellular locality (nucleus). Efforts to design and prepare new syn-
thetic materials for gene delivery are increasing, and an example highlighting the 
use of intelligent materials will be presented.

OPPO IS STANDING BAREFOOT IN. THE TINY KITCHEN, flipping 
mealy Bisquik pancakes. He is used to cooking for his fa.tl)ily; 
his mother Mary Anne is blind in one eye and reeling from respira-
tory disease. Poppo drenches three half-cooked pancakes in syrup 
for Mary Anne, who is sitting on a sunken couch, the only item of 
furniture in their stark living room. His sister Anna sleeps on a :mat-
tress on the floor rather than share a barracks-style bunk-bed with 
her two brothers in the bedroom. 

Mary Anne needs some luck right now. She lives.with three of 
her four children at Christian Community Action (cCA), a home-
less shelter in New Haven. Unless she can find an affordable apart-
ment by October 15, her shelter cut-off date, her family will disin-
tegrate. The Department of Children and Families (ocF) will seize 
her two youngest children and send them to live with strangers in 
foster homes. The arrangement would be temporary-if Mary 
Anne could find an apartment, she would regain custody-but she 
dreads the prospect of losing her kids. To pay for an apartment and 
keep her children, she needs a Section 8 voucher, a bond that the 
state pays to a landlord in place of rent. But the waiting list for 
Section 8 vouchers is more than 500 names long. Securing a vouch-
er, though possible, could take several years. 

Down the street, Jennifer and J ubi are fighting over green apple 
lip gloss. They are four and five years old respectively, and homeless. 

But their lives are more cheerful and comfortable than Mary Anne's. 
Jennifer got the lip gloss for her fourth birthday, along with a 
Momt~rs Inc. video, which she and her six brothers and sisters have 
watched three times in two days. They live at another CCA shelter 
with their mother Didi. Didi found a job last week: She is now a 
manager at Sam's Club, and her kids rave about her accomplish-
ment. Money is obviously tight, but her family went to Chuck E. 
Cheese last weekend, and the job will help Didi provide her chil-
dren with food and shelter. 

Both of these families, mired deep in poverty, are reaching on 
their tiptoes for the bottom rung of the economic ladder. But their 
stories will likely diverge. While Didi is on her way up, Mary Anne 
has litde. hope of escape. This is the story of two families struggling 
to find homes, and the obstacles in their way.

a cylindrical oxygen tank with a breathing tube that she inserts 
in her nostrils. She removes it to yell at 15-year-old Anna and 13-
year-old Joey, who are alternately hiding in the closet and chasing 
each other around the house. "What are you doing? Why are you 
doing that? Stupid assholes!" Her voice is dry and gracing, and 
yelling seems like it hurts. Mary Anne was in the hospital with 
pneumonia for three weeks in May and had to return several times
