franchising the dispossessed - all this 
was cast aside. 

The game plan to secure victory 
was carefully worked out. In the first 
phase, the reformers built an organiza-
tion. A registration drive was organized 
this summer in which carloads of 
blacks were taken down to the HaJI 
of Records where they enrolled as 
Democrats. Hundreds of youths got 
45 rpm records for registering as Dem-
ocrats. The reform machine's boss, Lee 
Wallace, campaigned for Joe Duffey and 
and Joe Lieberman, gaining new names 
for his card ftles and exchanging Hank 
Parker's endorsement for pledges of 
future support. 

Phase two was to change Parker's 
image - actually to bring it closer to 
reality. No longer was he to be the 
angry black, yearning for the libera-
tion of his people. Instead, his years 
as a gym teacher (educator, in the lit-
erature) as an executive of the tele-
phone company, as the owner of a day 
care center in Woodbridge, and his 
Boy Scout activism were stressed. 
Parker's media campaign was designed 
to sell him as an efficient manager for 
the city of New Haven, one who would 
make no bold changes, but who 
would make the city run more 
smoothly. He was to be the mayor of 
all the oeoole. 

Still, his liberal supporters must 
have flinched when he issued a state-
ment showering praise on Ben Delicto, 
the city's hack police chief who, in 
two months this summer, presided 
over the busting of heads at Yale grad-
uation andÂ· at a rock concert at the 
bowl, where his men arrested youths 
on the charge of possession of cocaine 
(it turned out to be quinine). 

But after all, the object this time 
was to win. Nothing else mattered. 

Imagine the great reformers' surprise 
when having sold themselves - that 
is, having gotten more ttian the 6,000 
votes they thought would be sufficient 
to win - they found that Arthur Bar-
bieri, the town Democratic chairman 
and a Yale dropout, had changed the 
rules without telling them and gotten 
9,000 votes for Bart Guida. 

Nor could moral victory be claimed. 
That belonged to Vincent Sirabella, 
who actually did promise a new kind 
of leadership, a coalition of working 
people of all races and a government 
that was concerned about people. Sir-
abella spoke up on issues that his op-
ponents would not touch. He spoke 
out against the fare increase by United 
IIJuminating and proposed that the 
city take over the company as a mun-
icipal utility. He proposed a graduated 
state income ta..< to protect the city's 
working class. But without an organ-
ization and without money, SirabeUa 
lost - and badly. 

So Arthur Barbieri will have anoth-
er go at it. New Haven will be able to 
test whether he can take a man off the 
street and make him mayor a second 
time. The opponent again will be Paul 
Capra, who hopes the $10,000 he's 
invested in billboards, and in the 
speech lessons he's taken to improve 
his platform appearance will make the 
necessary difference. In any event, the 
primary showed that the machine ain't 
dead yet.
