"
We were the ones who overthrew the 
old system. We have been persuading 
people not to bind their feet, but 
what about the old people? Their feet 
have already been bound, and you can· 
not cut off those feet, nor can they be 
restored to the original shape because 
the bones were broken. There is no way 
way to restore them. And we cannot 
attempt to hide them at home. Such 
an attempt would be reactionary. My 
mother had bound feet. But if it were 
not for her, how would I have come 
to be? My mcther herself cannot be 
responsible for having her feet bound 
either; she was also sacrificed by the 
old society. 

When foreign friends take pictures 
of such things, you must investigate 
.to see from what point of view they 
conceive of doing so. For instance, if 
they say that this is something left 
over from the old system, and they 
show the picture of bound feet as a 
comparison of the old and new so-
ciety, that is good. The new society 
always grows up upon the basis of the 
old society. If there were not the old, 
where would the new come from? 
They are opposites; they are in op-
position to each other. It's a dialecti-
cal matter. 

Who are there among you who 
would like to talk about philosophy? 
Later on you can have your say. But I 
haven't finished yet. (laughter) 

We stand on the position of the 
proletariat, and you of course are 
clear about that. As for our views we 
do our utmost to see that they are in 
accordance with those of Marx, Len-
in and Mao Tse-tung. 

You say that the youth are better 
than the older generation. We agree. 
We say that those who come later be-
come better. I am much older than 
they are, and I talk so much that there 
are bound to be flaws. It's not very 
favorable to be a Premier at such an 
advanced age. All right, don't let me 
be t1ie only one to speak. 

CCAS: I would like to say a word first. 
The aim of our trip to China has been 
to further the friendship and under· 
standing between the Chinese and 
American peoples. We believe that our 
main task when we return to the 
United States is to communicate to 
the American people the tremendous 
achievements and progress that have 
been made by the Peoples' Republic 
of China and the Chinese people. 

Chou En-lai: You must add some-
thing to that. You must say that there 
has been progress made, but there is 
still a lot to work on. Otherwise the 
viewpoint would not be complete. 

There are also some phenomena 
which are in the process of moving 
from the lower to the higher stage. 
This is the way things develop. If you 
simply say that there has been pro-
gress, people won't believe you. 

CCAS: We hope to get an accurate 
picture of China, and Pa$S this on to 
the American people. We feel that 
this has not been done in the past, 
and that the Arne rican people have a 
distorted picture of the Chinese people. 

1 Chang Ch'un Ch'iao and Yao Wen-
yuan are both members of the 
Central Committee of the Com-
m unist Party of China. Both were 
involved in· the "January Revolu-
tion " in Shanghai in 1967 an ad-
vanced group of the Cultural Revol-
ution. 

Chou En-lai Although the contribu-
tion which you make may be small 
at the beginning, its influence will 
gradually grow. And that is the way 
all new things develop. Who was going 
to put forward some philosophical 
problems to these two comrades here?* 

CCAS: I'm interested in the move-
ment to study philosophy that has 
arisen among the Chinese masses since 
the cultural revolution. I believe it has 
great significance, not only for China, 
but also for the American movement. 
Could I ask either Comrade Chang or 
Comrade Yao how they particularly 
study philosophy and how they apply 
it in their daily work? 

Yao: I agree with your idea and your 
question. We study some philosophical 
works of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and 
also some of the works of Marx and 
Lenin. Our aim is to come to know the 
world and to transform the world. 
And in transforming the world there 
are two aspects; that is, to transform 
society, and also to transform one's 
own ideas, one's ideology. 

For instance, Chairman Mao Tse-
tung put forward a thesis of contin-
uing the revolution under the dicta-
torship of the proletariat, and this is 
in itself a very important philosophical 
problem that is to say, in a socialist 
society there still exist classes, class 
contradictions, and class struggle. And 
personally, it has taken me a gradual 
process to come to understand this 
question. 

All this in the final analysis is a 
question of one's world outlook, a 
question of philosophy. And this is 
what we call "to study with problems 
in mind". And in my practice in the 
revolution the problems that I have 
come up against most are ideological 
ones. My study in this field has not 
been as good as the advanced elements 
of the workers, peasants and People's 
liberation Army. I should continue to 
learn from them. To study philosophy 
one must study the present situation, 
history, theory, and make the correct 
analysis, draw out the correct conclu-
sions, and be able to find the laws 
guiding the development. 

CCAS: I have a non-philosophical 
question What is there that has 
changed the relationship between the 
Chinese and American people after 22 
years of separation? And what are the 
biggest problems we still have in de-
veloping the friendship between the 
Chinese and American people? 

Chou En-lai: The foremost thing is 
that the Chinese and American people 
wish to exchange visits with each other 
and this strong desire has broken 
through the barriers. Isn't one of your 
points that you believe that the older 
generation of Asian scholars in Amer-
ica has gotten mixed up with the 
government, or has become silent? 

CCAS: That's right. 

Chou En-lai: First, I agree with your 
aims. But secondly, I must say some 
words of sympathy for them. They 
happened to be oppressed in the 50's, 
during the McCarthy period, and this 
was a great harm for them. I recall 
what I said, at the Bandung Confer-

ence in 1955. It was that peoples of 
China and the United States wished 
to have friendly contact with each 
other. It cannot be said that there was 
no response to my words. There were 
a few progressive correspondents who 
wished to come to China, but theSe· 
cretary of State at the time, John 
Foster Dulles, denied them that right. 
I believe that these facts could be 
found in the files of the State Depart· 
ment, and I don't think that they 
should be classified documents. 
(laughter) 

But now we have passed through 
the sixties and entered the seventies. 
And it's your generation, your era, 
and you have broken through the bar-
riers. And so with one sentence of 
Chairman Mao's we invited the United 
States table tennis team to visit China. 
And so they came! The barriers were 
broken through. For this we must 
thank the new forces of your era. Isn't 
that so? And these new and friendly 
contacts are bound to continue. When 
you go back you will introduce even 
more American friends to us. Also 
some black friends. Of course if you 
would be able to introduce some 
minorities of the United States to us, 
we would be very thankful. 

Let them all come to China to have 
a look. Of course, we will also return 
the visits. Your CCAS, the Commit-
tee of Concerned Asian Scholars (this 
he said in English) has invited us, and 
since you are so kind, I think that our 
young Chinese friends should afso re-
turn the visit I believe you will also 
welcome not only men, but also eo-
men (lau!tlter). It would be a good 
thing to make it equal in numbers. 

Even in our socialist country, a coun-
try of the dictatorship of the proletar-
iat, male chauvinism comes up now 
and then. Of course subconsciously. 

Chang: Today, seated here among the 
Chinese comrades, the number of 
men and women are not equal yet. 

Chou En-Jai: See, he's criticizing me. 
Yet I have tried my utmost to pay at· 
tention to the fact. When I invited the 
comrades from Tsinghue University, 
I invited one man and one woman ... 

CCAS: How do you view internal 
events in the United States and their 
relationship to the new contact be-
tween China and the United States? 

Chou En-lai: Different states still 
exist in the world, and if there is no 
normalization of the relations between 
the two states, then it will be impos· 
sible for contact between the two peo-
ples to develop unhindered. The gov-
ernments of the two countries bear 
the main responsibility in this. It will 
take process and time. Isn't that so? 

One of you said that though the re~ 
volutionary movement in United States 
is developing, it cannot be said that it 
would be able to transform the entire 
system at the present date. It will take 
time to transform society. In recent 
years, Chairman Mao himself has paid 
attention to the American situation. 
He has asked us all to note the fact 
that it can be said that the United 
States is now on the eve of a great 
storm. But the question of how this 
storm shall be developed is yours, not 
ours. We can only tell you about 
something of our hopes. 

To normalize relations we must con-
tact those who are in authority in 
your country. Your president has said 
that he wishes to move toward friend-
ship and that he hopes to visit ·China. 
Naturally we can invite him, in order 
to seek the normalization of relations 
between the two countries, and also to 
discuss questions concerning both 
sides. But what are the obstructions to 
the improvement of the relations be-

CCAS: Taiwan ... lndochina ... 

Chou En-lai: You have mentioned the 
ri!tlt problems. I would like to reaf· 
firm our stand on Taiwan. 

First, if state relations are to bees-
tablished between the United States 
and China, then it must be recognized 
that the government of the People's 
Republic of China is the sole legiti-
mate government representing the 
Chinese people. 

Second, Taiwan is a province of 
China and it is an inalienable part of 
China's territory. After the second 
World War Taiwan was restored to 
China. The liberation of Taiwan by the 
Chinese people is an internal affair of 
China which brooks no foreign inter-
vention. 

Third, the theory that the status of 
Taiwan is yet unsettled is absurd. In 
1894, Japan defeated China in war and 
took Taiwan. During the Second World 
War, however, in the Cairo Declaration 
and later in the Potsdam Proclama-
tion, it was affirmed that Taiwan should 
should be returned to China. Then in 
1945, when Japan surrendered, the 
Chinese government accepted the re-
turn of Taiwan. 

Fourth, we oppose any advo-
cation of a two-China policy, or any 
similar policy. And if such a situation 
continues in the United Nations, we 
will not go there. 

Fifth, we are resolutely op-
posed to the so-called "Taiwan inde-
pendence movement." Because the 
people in Taiwan are Chinese. Taiwan 
was originally a province of China. And 
a thousand years ago it had already 
become a part of China. The dialect 
spoken in Taiwan is the same dialect 
spoken in the area around Amoy in 
Fukier Province. Of course there are 
minority nationalities like the Kaoshan 
nationality in Taiwan, the minority 
that lives on the high hills. There are 
also various national minorities on the 
mainland and we pursue a policy of 
national equality. Besides, the "Tai-
wan independence movement" is not 
a native movement in itself. It is a 
movement which has behind it special 
manipulation by foreign forces. One of 
their leaders is P'eng Ming-min who 
was originally a student at Harvard, 
then returned to Taiwan to become a 
professor, and now is back in the 
United States. There is some element 
of this movement in Japan. They are 
supported by the Japanese government. 

Sixth, the United States·should 
withdraw all of its present mili-
tary strength and military installa-
tions from Taiwan and the Taiwan 
Straits. The defense treaty which was 
agreed to by the United States and 
Chiang Kai-shek in 1954 (about the 
so-called "defense of Taiwan and 
Panghu") is illegal, and the Olinese 
people do not recognize that treaty. 

This is our stand. It has not changed 
since the beginning of the Ambassa-
dorial Talks between China and the 
United States that began on the first 
of August. 1955. And it shall not 
change.

You mentioned very correctly that 
we are also concerned with the Indo-
china issue. This question also con-
cerns China and the United States. You 
have said that one of your aims is op-
position to the aggressive policies of 
the United States in Indochina and 
Asia. Isn't that so? 

CCAS: Yes. 

Chou En-lai: The aggressive policies of 
the United States - at first in Vietnam 
- later expanded to the whole of 
Indochina. China has not gone to 
Vietnam or Indochina to commit ag-
gression. We are assisting the people 
there to fi~t against aggression. 

The question goes back to 1954. 
At that time during the Geneva Con-
ference we reached an agreement. At 
that time we Chinese and our Vietna-
mese friends, lacked experience in 
international subjects. The represen-
tatives of the United States did not 
sign the documents but only made a 
statement that they would not dis· 
.turb the agreement. But the reality 
was not so. 

How could it be that a country 
which would not sign an agreement 
would truly agree not to disturb it. 
Therefore, immediately following the 
Geneva Agreements, the Manila Con· 
terence was held at which SEATO was 
formed and a line of demarcation was 
drawn. Of course, SEATO has now 
gone bankrupt. But after the Geneva 
Agreement the election was not held 
and the U.S. assisted Ngo Dinh Diem 
to overthrow Bao Dai. The U.S. got 
control of South Vietnam that way. 

All those who participated in the Gen-
eva Conference will admit that if 
there had been an election in Viet-
nam as stipulated by the Geneva 
Agreements, President Ho Chi Minh 
would have been elected. Through the 
war of resistance against the French 
aggression he had won great esteem, 
not only among the Vietnamese peo· 
ple but also among the people of all 
Indochina. But that did not come 
about and the facts are the United 
States committed aggression first in 
Vietnam. 

Now this question lies before the 
people of the United States, the peo-
ple of Indochina and us, and the only 
way to solve this problem is that we 
show our complete support for the 7 
point proposaf put forth by Mme 
Nguven Thi Binh on the first of July 
on behalf of the Provisional Revolu· 
tionary Govt. of the South Vietnam 
Republic and the Vietnamese people, 
and the Chinese government and the 
Chinese people completely support 
this proposition. We know that broad 
masses of the people of the United 
States are also opposed to the aggres-
sive war in Vietnam which has now 
expanded into the whole of Indochina. 

We are a neighbor of the Indochin-
ese countries. We assisted them, sup-
ported them, in their war of resist~nce 
against France. And in the same spirit 
support them in their war of resis-
tance against US aggression for na· 
tional salvation. This is known to the 
world. No matter whether"in the 
United States or abroad, we believe 
the greatest cry is for the United States 
to withdraw its troops from Vietnam 
and the whole of Indochina. We be· 
lieve that at the present day among 
the American people the most out· 
standing issue is not only for the 
United States to withdraw its troops 
from Vietnam but also from the whole 
of Indochina not only troops but all 
military forces and all military instal· 
lations. 

It mi~t be said that this demand is 
even stronger than the demand to re-
store relations between the Chinese 
and American people. The people of 
the United States do not wish to sacri-
fice the lives of their people in a dirty 
war. 

We believe that the question to be 
solved first should be the question of 
Indochina, and by_doing so we would 
be satisfying not only the interests of 
the Indochinese people but also of the 
people of the United States. 

And besides these 2 issues I think 
there are other issues worth your at· 
tention. I should like to remind you 
that in Korea up to the present day 
there is only a ceasefire. Only an armis-
tice agreement was passed. After that 
there was a meeting in Geneva, the 
same Geneva Conference, in 1954. 
The first stage of that conference 
was devoted to Korea. It was com-
pletely without results. On the final 
day there was no result whatsoever 
with regard to the Korean question. 
Then what was the use of our coming? 
We said that at least we should set a 
date for another meeting. The foreign 
ministers of certain countries agreed 
to this, Mr. Spaak of Belgium for in-
stance. The chairman of the meeting 
was Mr. Eden. He wavered a bit and 
he tended to agree w ith us. But there 
was an authoritative representative 
seated at the conference who waved 
his hand in opposition. The Korea 
question was by-passed. You proba-
bly know who the representative was: 
the deputy of Mr. John Foster Dulles, 
Mr. Smith. He didn't say anything, he 
couldn't find any words. He just waved 
his hand. And so now at the 38th 
parallel in Korea there is a military 
armistice commission that meets every 
week. There's only a ceasefire, there's 
no other treaty whatsoever. Accord-
ing to international law the state of 
war has not yet ended. 

There are still American troops in 
South Korea. The Chinese Peoples' 
volunteers withdrew from Korea in 
1958. The American troops in South 
Korea are there under the banner of 
the United Nations. Yet many coun-
tries of the United Nations have with-
drawn their troops. It is almost the 
same case between China and Japan. 
The state of war has not been called 
off yet. We still have not concluded 
a peace treaty And in relation with 
that there is the whole question of 
Japan.
