Dewey Faulkner teaches Beowulf 
and other things at Yale. He dabbles 
from time to time in translating 
Beowulf into 'its only historically 
justifiable form,' heroic couplets. 
One Man's Mead 
And if the Babe is born a Boy 
He's given to a Woman Old, 
Who nails him down upon a rock, 
Catches his shrieks in cups of gold. 

So begins John Gardner's Grendel. 
This isn't an obscure passage of Anglo-
Saxon poetry that has gained a lot in 
translation; it is a stanza from Blake's 
'Mental Traveller' that contains an 
image of life in our fallen world - here 
viewed as an image of Beowulf's 
Grendel and his mother. With this 
epigraph the author gives fair warning 
of the allusive, consciously 'literary': 
quality of the book to come. If you 
skip the epigraph, you'll find the book 
to be as gutsy as is necessary - for 
sales as well. Esquire is reprinting 
parts of it; critics uniformly are in 
squealing ecstasies over it. At this 
stage the only thing to do is read it. 
You'll probably like it. (Even people 
who do not especially like modern 
novels and who do especially like 
Beowulf have liked it.) 

My particular quarrel is with those 
reviewers, who tend to be fuzzy 
('philosophical,' 'profound') where 
the author is clear; more misrepresen-
tation of the medieval. The lecturing 
pedant in me rises. And so, believing 
that a good word for Grendel is a good 
word for Beowulf (and that a good 
word for Beowulf is good for business), 
I present the following nifty brief 
guide to Grendel. ( Feor ut.) 

To begin with, the plot is mainly 
a continued allusion to Beowulf- at 
least, to that part of it in which Gren-
del is the leading monster villain. Al-
most everyone has read a translation 
of the poem at some time (I hope) -
the original Old English being re-
served for the dedicated - and by not 
rewriting the story, Gardner does not 
disturb us (especially me). King 
Hrothgar of Denmark builds his king-
dom and his mead hall, Heorot or 
Hart; our old friends Wealtheow, Un-
ferth , Hrothulf, etc., live there. Anger-
ed by the poet's (Shaper's) songs, 
Grendel comes in at night and kills 
and devours the Danish warriors. 

Beowulf arrives from southern Sweden 
with his small band of followers, of-
fers to aid Hrothgar against Grendel, 
defeats the jealous Unferth in a verbal 
combat, and finally defeats Grendel 
physically by catching him by surprise, 
hand-wrestling with him, and tearing 
off his arm. Gardner is a good mediev-
alist: he doesn't alter his 'matter.' 

But he does embroider it a bit. 
First, Grendel does all the talking. (He 
only chuckles a little in the poem. But 
he is vaguely human, descended from 
Cain just as all the humans proper are 
descended from Abel's brother Seth; 
so Gardner is well within his rights.) 
Then, Grendel tells about numerous 
incidents that didn't get into the 'of-
ficial' poem, the most important being 
his visit to the dragon (whom Beo-
wulf is to fight after he kills Grendel
