Prepared by the Yale Chapter of the 
Committee of Concerned Asian 
Scholars and Edited by 'The New 
Journal' 
This tex t is excerpted from tape re-
cordings made by members of the 
Committee of Concerned Asian Schol-
ars Friendship Delegation to China 
during their four hour interview wi th 
Premier Chou En-Lai on July 19 in the 
Great Hall of the People, Peking_ As 
Chou himself pointed out, there is lots 
of room for error and misquotation 
in an interview of this nature. " Maybe 
I will say something wrong, or the in-
terpreter might interpret wrong." 
Therefore he expressly stated "If you 
are going to show your recordings 
when you get back to the United States 
States, you must make a statement at 
the beginning and say there are bound 
to be some wrong statements in this 
recording." 

The following transcript was sent 
by Pacific News Service and CCAS 
to the New Journal. CCAS was found-
ed in 1969 to struggle against the com-
plicity of the Asian studies field in 
supporting A merican domination of 
Asian societies.

The May 4th Movement of 1919 
was a series of large scale militant 
demonstrations organized by stu-
dents, workers, and merchants in 
all major Chinese cities. The agita-
tions were set off by decisions taken 
at the post-war Paris Peace confer-
ence which turned German commer-
cial concessions in the Shantung 
Penins1,1la o ver to Japan. 

Chou En-lai: We welcome you. It is 
rare that we are able to meet so many 
young American friends. We hear that 
you are a young generation of scholars. 
We have heard that you think the pre-
sent youth movement in the United 
States is similar to the May Fourth 
Movement in China. I was a participant 
in the May Fourth movement and 
meeting you, it seems that I have gone 
back 52 years. But I don't think it's 
exactly the same. Perhaps you also 
have a bit of our Red Guard Move-
ment in your movement now. Is that 
so? 

CCAS: I think that's a very good 
analysis. 

Chou En-Lai: I understand you're the 
liaison officer. During the May 4th 
Movement in China we also liked 
to pick young women to be our lead-
ers. For instance, my wife, Comrade 
Teng YingÂ·Ch'ao, did that work when 
she was only 15. At that time, we had 
a majority of middle school students 
in the movement and the college stu-
dents were only a minority. Now you 
are all college graduates, as in our Red 
Guard period. It is a Red Guard trend 
of thought that they don't like to be 
called 'minister' or 'section head' or 
'director'. We must do away with the 
bureaucratic structure and call our-
selves 'service personnel' of the people. 

An Interview with Chou En-Lai
I think you have the same ideas. We 
see some of your men wearing their 
hair long and growing beards to ex-
press dissatisfaction with the status 
quo. There are two men here with large 
beards. 

Those in the Red Guard movement 
liked to wear coarse clothes, army uni-
forms, and armbands and also clothes 
that had as many patches as possible. 
You were asking why people weren't 
wearing the colorful cloth produced in 
the textile mills. It is because the cus-
tom today is to live simply and to 
wear simple clothes (as a symbol of 
discipline.) The style of simplicity is 
also in opposition to bourgeois de-
gradation. 

Chou En-lai: You are right to want to 
go among the masses of the Chinese 
people. There is not OJuch to talk about 
with us (laughter) - just the same o ld 
issues. You will see that what Mrs. 
Chou En-lai sa~ has all been printed 
in the newspapers (laughter) and to 
listen to it is nauseating (laughter). 
Isn't that so? 

CCAS: (CCAS expresses a desire to 
see factories and communes not pre-
viously visited by Westerners) 

Chou: You are right and I thank you. 
We will arrange it. That's the right 
way to do things - criticize us. It is 
also criticism for our Travel Bureau, 
and above them there is the Foreign 
Ministry. We welcome very much this 
spiritual help from you. It is "recti-
fying wrong ideas". That is Chair-
man Mao's wording. It is not brain-
washing; it is rectifying erroneous 
ideas. I haven't thought of a way to 
wash one's brain yet. In a certain 
sense I would like to have my brain 
washed of the old ideas in my mind. 
I have already passed 73. How can it 
be said that I have no old ideas in my 
head? I came over from the old so-
ciety. 

In the old society, I wore a braid, 
a pigtail. But, of course, you can't see 
it on me now. In all the cities and in 
the great and overwhelming majority 
of the countryside you can't see that 
phenomenon any more. But I cannot 
say it has completely died. 

Another phenomenon: there are 
a number of women whose feet were 
once bound. This is left over from the 
old society, the old system. So there 
are no people in Chinese society who 
have bound feet now? There still are. 
This seems a very new experience for 
foreign friends, for instance the binding 
of feet is a phenomenon which the old 
society should be held responsible for.
