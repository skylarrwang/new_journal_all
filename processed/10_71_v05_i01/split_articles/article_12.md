LONG WHARF 
You Can't Take It With You 
The Moss Hart- George S. Kaufman exuberant comedy favorite, 
direct from its acclaimed engagement at the Edinburgh Inter· 
national Festival in Scotland. TERESA WRIGHT is featured as 
Penny Sycamore, matriarch of one of theatre's most rambunct· 
ious and lovable families, who "do their own thing" 1930's-style. 
Directed by Arvin Brown. 
Oct. 22 - Nov. 13 

The Contractor 
The American Premiere of a new play by David Storey, author 
of last season's New York hit, HOME. A poetic play about the 
nature of skilled work, the meaning of community in our society, 
and the effect of its loss, all set in the rowdy jocularity of a crew 
of tent-raising roustabouts. 
Nov. 19- Dec. 11 

A Streetcar Named Desire 
The Pulitzer Prize-winning play by one of the twentieth century's 
most powerful playwrights, Tennessee Williams. An emotionally· 
devastating drama of the confrontation between the fantasy-rapt 
Blanche DuBois and her animalistic brother-in-law Stanley Kowal-
ski. A stunning work, considered Williams' greatest. 
Dec. 17 - Jan. 15** 

Hamlet 
William Shakespeare's towering classic of festering guilt and 
bloody vengeance. Noted stage and screen actor STACY KEACH, 
an LWT alumnus, will return to play the title role, making this 
production one of the major events of the American theatre 
season. Directed by Arvin Brown. 
Jan. 21 - Feb.12 

The Way of the World 
William Congreve's delicious romp is considered the high-water 
mark of Restoration comedy. The style is dazzling and the wit 
brilliant in this whirl of gallants, wicked wives, and worldly 
wooing. Watch for press announcements of Special Guest Artists! 
Feb. 18- Mar. 11 

Troika: An Evening of Russian Comedy 
The American premiere of Turgenev's THE COUNTRY WOMAN, 
plus Chekhov's THE WEDDING and SWAN SONG, in new 
adaptations by MORRIS CARNOVSKY. Mr. Carnovsky, whose 
appearance last season in YEGOR BULICHOV is a happy 
memory for LWT audiences, will direct two of the delightful 
short plays and appear in the third, to be directed by Arvin 
Brown. 
Mar. 17 - Apr. 8 

The Iceman Cometh 
After national acclaim for his New York revival of Eugene O'Neill's 
LONG DAY'S JOURN EY INTO NIGHT with Robert Ryan, 
Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Stacy Keach, director Arvin Brown 
once again works his magic touch with America's greatest play· 
wright. A character actor's dream, this masterful O'Neill drama 
is filled w ith colorful, touching, down-and-out figures.

rison, dealing with the tragic last day in the life of a world·

DOUBLE SOLITAIRE, soon to open with the LWT company on 
Broadway!
