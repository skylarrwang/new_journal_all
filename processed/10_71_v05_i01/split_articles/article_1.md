The New Journal
Yale is back, likewise The New Journal, 
and while the first was perhaps inevitable, 
the second - for financial reasons - was far from it. But anyone 
can tell you how hard times are in 
New Haven. 

The question, then, for the uninitiated-and the absent minded, is: what 
is The New Journal. 

We are first of all a publication of 
the Yale community, financially and 
editorially independent of the university. Published every three weeks, The 
New Journal includes interviews, reviews, news commentary fiction, 
photography, and fine graphics. The 
New Journal serves as the only university-wide medium for intelligent 
debate and is wont, when it finds 
muck, to rake it - in honest, carefully 
researched articles. We think it is worth 
your reading time. 

You may, we hope, also think The 
New Journal worth working for. We 
need assistance in every phase of the 
magazine's production (freelancing 
welcome). We have no heel and we ate 
open to suggestions and innovation. 
Call us any time if you'd like to help. 

With this issue, Volume five, number one, The New Journal passes into 
the hands of a new generation of editors. We are optimistic. Two years ago, 
one of our editors wrote, "We may 
well fail," and that is still possible. 
But we disagree with him when he 
adds that in this "existentially draining 
world even the thought of failure is . 
invigorating." Bah. Nothing could be 
worse. 

Love us or hate us, wonder if we 
hold nothing sacred, but speak out. 
Vigorously. We'll do the same.
