Last week a sign on one of the front 
doors of the new Health Center on 
Hillhouse Avenue read "Please Do 
Not Use - Handle is Broken." 

The sign was in refreshing contrast 
to the slick, cool, mechanical perfection 
of the rest of the building. Like 
its immediate predecessors on the Yale 
architectural scene - the Cross Campus 
Library and the Becton Engineering 
Center - the new Health Center is 
not the warmest of buildings. 

But while the Health Center shares 
the antiseptic atmosphere of Becton 
and the Cross Campus Library to a 
certain degree it is, a far better building. On the one hand, it lacks the sense 
of being overdesigned that the foolish 
rubber stamp window pattern of Becton 
gives to the facade of that building; 
on the other hand, it lacks the utter 
sterility of the Cross Campus Library. 
Of course, anything could be warmer 
than that; but still, the Health Center 
makes a real effort to create an inviting 
space, even if it doesn't fully succeed. 

The new building gets high marks 
for effort. The facade tries to be dynamic 
with its. varying pattern of window 
arrangements; unfortunately, the 
whole thing ends up looking like a Le 
Corbusier facade that someone put a 
sander to. It is too flattened, too 
smooth. 

The architects - Helge Westermann-
Richard Miller Associates of New 
York made a good try at reducing 
the impact of the building's enormous 
bulk on Hillhouse Avenue, a 
street of low scale that cries out for 
non-monumental construction. Their 
solution was to lower the building by 
one floor on the Hillhouse Avenue 
side, and place the bulky volume in 
the rear. From the street this gives the 
effect of two wings, though this isn't 
reflected in the plan of the building. 
Alas, this one, too, doesn't quite come 
off. The bulk of the rear "wing" is 
just too imposing; it dominates Hill-
house from either end of the street. 

But in their attempt to relate to the 
street, however awkward, Westermann-
Miller showed themselves far more 
sensitive urban architects than Marcel 
Breuer at Becton. The Becton Center 
tries its best to overrun Prospect Street, 
instead of cooperating with its scale. 

The new Health Center should work 
well with Robert Venturi's projected 
Mathematics Building across the street, 
the subject of cruel and undeserved attack 
in last week's Yale Daily News. 
The gentle curve of the Math Building's 
facade should perfectly complement 
the sharp straight lines of the Health 
Center. (The Math Building, in fact, 
succeeds in doing what the Health Center 
couldn't: creating an interesting, 
yet modest, facade that could work 
itself into the complex fabric of Hill-
house Avenue.) 

Inside, the Health Center is a bit 
more traditional and a bit more successful 
as well. The interiors are 
"standard modern" - almost a bit 
cliched, in fact, with cinder blocks 
and concrete matched with stained 
woods, indirect lighting, and not-too-far-out 
"designer" chairs. It's a 
formula that calls to mind The Architects' 
Collaborative among other 
firms, and it's really Yale's first exposure 
on full building scale to this 
sort of design, not quite like the cool 
corporate modernism of Reinecke or 
the rough-and-tough modernism of the 
Art and Architecture Building. It's 
something oddly in-between, and 
somehow, from the heavy woods and 
cinder blocks, a strange sort of warmth 
and elegance emerge. 

The patients' rooms on the infirmary 
floors are simpler. (One of the 
first students to spend a few nights 
there said "It's sort of like being sick 
in a room at Howard Johnson's Motor 
Lodge.") But bright colors, good views 
from many of the windows, and new 
furniture make the rooms an elegant 
step up from the old infirmary - in 
fact they are probably an elegant step 
up from most regular hospital rooms. 

Almost all the furniture and equipment 
in the Health Center is new. In 
fact, just about the only holdover 
from the old Department of University 
Health building - without them, 
no one would feel at home - are the 
magazines. Like always, they're all 
six months old.
