Graduation day at Yale this year 
was no picnic. It seemed at times more 
like an old-fashioned sit-in. Twelve 
people were arrested and several hundred 
Yale workers tried to shut down 
the graduation. They tried to stop the 
academic procession by bulldogging 
their way through a double cordon of 
New Haven cops. They didn't make 
it. But they put on a show which starred, 
among others, National Welfare 
Rights Director George Wiley, civil 
rights leader Father James Groppi, 
and both the 1970 and 1971 Presidents 
of the National Student Association, 
hardly a normal union strike force. Of 
course, Yale's workers hardly constitute 
a normal union. In fact, they're 
not really a union at all. They're a 
movement. 

Yale workers went on strike April 
30. During the spring, the campus reverberated 
to much noise on the subject, 
and virtually no understanding 
whatsoever. Despite Yale's reputation 
for radical chic, no one could figure 
out why the union was striking. Most 
people assumed, that the union was 
going out over traditional bread and 
butter issues. After all, it just didn't 
make sense that the union was striking 
over "job security." 

From late January through graduation 
day, Yale's management representatives 
and union leaders had been 
deadlocked over that very issue. The 
union demanded a management guarantee 
that Yale would not place more 
bursary students in "union jobs." 
Management countered that, as a 
"matter of principle," it would not 
limit its rights to employ students. The 
union observed that management could 
fill up "union jobs" with bursary students 
through attrition - when a union 
man quit his job, it would go to a student, 
rather than a worker. Management 
argued that it couldn't protect 
future workers by "freezing" their job 
slot, just so the union could preserve 
its size. "We're not in the business of 
welfare," said Management, to which 
the union replied, "we're not looking 
for handouts, we're looking for a fair 
shake," and went out on strike. Yale 
was then confronted with the curious 
spectacle of workers whose own jobs 
were protected by Yale's no-layoff 
guarantee, agreeing to strike essentially 
for the sake of union solidarity. 

The few people at Yale who followed 
the facts this far, and chose not 
to bail out behind the surreality of the 
situation, immediately focused speculation 
upon the union's charismatic 
leader, Vincent Sirabella. They surmised 
that Sirabella wanted to preserve union 
job slots simply to feather-

bed his own pocket - despite the fact 
that a union composed of 1157 largely 
unskilled workers would have trouble 
keeping a midget in breakfast cereal; 
they speculated that Sirabella's mayoralty 
campaign was running on an anti-
Yale ticket - despite the fact that 
"campaigner" Sirabella hardly raised 
a Yale-related issue off campus; they 
proposed that Sirabella was simply a 
demagogue ego-tripping off his workers 
- despite the fact that the man issued 
a number of statements which by all 
rights should have damaged his following. 
Nobody managed to get hold 
of Sirabella's number, but they were 
right about one thing; the man indeed 
is the one responsible for creating an 
impossible strike. 

Sirabella accomplished the impossible 
because he had two all-absorbing 
problems and two all-powerful assets 
to deal with. The problems were that 
his union was not a union and that a 
good many of his friends were a part of 
New Haven's growing 10 percent unemployed. 
The assets were that he is 
not very good at collective bargaining, 
and that his opponent at the bargaining 
table was Yale University. 

Sirabella's union is not a union because 
it never got itself together as 
Yale moved in its modern management 
team in 1966. Before 1966, the 
workers wallowed pleasantly, if penuriously, 
in the security of Yale's plantation 
paternalism. The new team,
