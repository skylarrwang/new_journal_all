It is a fact that Japanese militarism 
is being revived because the Japanese 
economy is developing.in a lop-sided 
way. They depend on foreign coun· 
tries for natural resources and for mar· 
kets too. After the war they were not 
burdened by paying reparations and 
for quite some time they spent very 
little on armaments. How was the 
Japanese economy developed? There 
is one characteristic of the develop· 
ment of their economy. that is, they 
made a fortune on wars fought by 
others, the war of aggression against 
Korea and the war of aggression against 
Vietnam. 

For instance, the United States 
estimates that within the past ten years, 
it has spent 120 billion American dollars 
on the Indochina war. Out of this Japan 
made quite a lot of money from the 
military repairs, transportation, and 
communication costs. In all these fields 
I think Japan made quite a lot of money. 
Twenty·five years after the second 
World War, Japan, a defeated power, 
has become the number two economic 
power in the Western countries. Presi· 
dent Nixon praises Japan as his biggest 
partner. He made that statement on the 
6th of July, in Kansas City. He also 
describes Japan as a competitor. Nixon 
praised Japan in these terms: that the 
output of steel in Japan last year ap-
proached 100 million tons. Japan 
either this year or next may catch up 
with the United States' 110 million 
tons annually in steel output. What 
will issue from this lopsided develop· 
ment of Japan? She needs to carry out 
an economic expansion abroad. Other· 
wise, she cannot maintain her economy. 
And so, being in a capitalist system, 
followinQ this economic expansion, 
there is inevitably. bound to come with 
it military expansion. Japan's fourth 
defense plan is from 1972 to 1976, 
and it plans to spend more than six· 
teen billion American dollars. In the 
first three defense plans from theSe· 
cond World War to 1971 Japan spent 
a total of only a bit over 1 0 billion. 
According to the present economic 
capacity of Japan, she does not require 
5 years to carry out this 4th plan. As 
we see it, they may be able to fulfill 
it in only 2 or 2Y:z years. It's all further 
proof, that the appetite, the ambitions 
are becoming greater. 

So there does exist this danger. And 
also, what is more, the peoples of the 
Pacific and first of all the peoples of 
the Far East are no longer the peoples 
of the 30's or the 40's. The Japanese 
people are aware of the fact that if 
Japanese-militarism is revived, it will 
not benefit Japan. 


**Title: Chou En-lai's Conversation with CCAS**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

Chou En·lai: National membership of 
CCAS are college graduates in the 
United States? 
CCAS There are some· who are study· 
ing in college. 
Chou En·lai: Then in our country, you 
would be considered high intellec· 
tuals, and you· have a heavy responsi· 
bility. And it is our responsibility to 
link the truth, the general truth, with 
actual practice. And that must be im· 
plemented through you. Some of you 
friends have said that foreign exper-
ience cannot be mechanically brought 
over to your country. 

We cannot impose on you, nor can 
you just mechanically copy from us. 
You can see the American youth is 
gradually raising their political con-
sciousness. According to our exper-
ience, it is always intellectuals who 
start out, because it is easier for them 
to accept revolutionary theory. and 
revolutionary experience from books. 
But for the movement to succeed, you 
must go among the workers, because 
in the United States the working class 
is the great majority of the people, 
and the peasantry is quite small. You 
must go into them deeply. Yes, one 
must go through some arduous pro-
cess. 

.. .like trying 
CCAS: I would like to say a word 
about the process which Premier Chou 
has talked about, because in the United 
States, in our struggle there has been 
a peculiar process of gaining informa-
tion and gaining knowledge. This 
is the question of knowledge. One of · 
the main contradictions of our pro-
cess of gaining information about the 
problems that we deal with is that we 
were only first awakened by the vio· 
lent struggl.e in Vietnam and our learn-
ing process then began to go back· 
wards. As we investigated the origins 
of the conflict in Vietnam we were 
taken further and further back. We 
were embarrassed the other evening 
when we were talking with our Korean 
friends that still we do not have a clear 
understanding of the Korean situation, 
so we keep on going backwards in our 
understanding. We think that our 
knowledge of the development of 
American imperialist policy is still 
imperfect in many ways. 

Chou En-lai: You have addressed your· 
selves to various problems throughout 
the world. Your American friends 
should have a broad perspective be-
cause as you know the United States 
after World War II has extended itself 
everywhere in the world, even to the 
moon. (Laughter) As Chairrman Mao 
said, they look into other people's 
affairs everywhere. And as a result, 
they merely put nooses about their 
own necks. There is a saying in China,

to catch ten fleas with ten fingers. 
that that is like trying to catch ten 
fleas with ten fingers. When you are 
trying to catch one flea, another one 
jumps out. And the result is that all 
of them escape. And at the most, you 
can only catch one flea by freeing one 
of your hands and letting go five f leas 
instead. 

That is the predicament that Pres-
ident Nixon is now facing. But it 
would be more fair to say that it is not 
only of his own making but also 
something he couldn't even have 
dreamt of in those days. And the op-
posite of that is that people like you 
are rising up and tak ing action. 

At the conclusion of the Second 
World War the United States imperialists 
appeared to be almighty. The world 
is changing. But the American people 
should not feel any discouragemel't 
There is great hope for the American 
people. 

Although we are a socialist coun-
try, we must be vigilant against our-
selves. Chairman Mao constantly 
teaches us that we must at all times be 
on the alert against committing the 
mistake of big power chauvinism both 
at home and abroad. Because in the 
world there is another country which 
is learning from you and sending its 
hand out everywhere and competing 
with you. Economic competition is 
bound to bring with it military com-
petition. Economic development 
combined w ith military expansion is 
bound to occupy various places 
throughout the world. 

In our revolution, many of our 
comrades sacrificed their lives. Chair-
man Mao often says that we are those 
left over from the Revolutionary Wars. 
You have the spirit of pioneers. Al-
most 200 years now, isn't that so? 
Chairman Mao often likes to talk 
about when George Washington rose 
up to oppose the British Colonial rule 
with only a population of three mil-
lion. At that time Britain had proba-
bly a population of around ten times 
the population of the United States. 
But you had the pioneering spirit, fear-
ing no difficulties, and the British Col-
onial army was beaten by you every-
where. And the Americans at that 
time precisely carried out guerrilla 
warfare, firing from this corner and 
that corner. And you started your 
struggle in 1775. And on your 200th 
anniversary you will come again. At 
that time you may only see two of us. 
At that time we will congratulate you. 
Five years is not a long time. 

If one puts in efforts and struggles 
hard, great results will take place. For 
instance when the Chinese Commun-
ist Party was founded in 19i1, there 
were only 12 deputies to the First 
Party Congress, and the total number 
of Communist Party members at that 
time did not exceed 70. But only about 
three years later in 1924, it had 
changed tremendously. By 1926 our 
forces were already above fifty thou-
sand. Such tremendous changes took 
place within a period of only five years, 
but your era is totally different from 
the era of those days. While we can 
make the comparison, history will 
not re-enact itself. We always say that 
times are advancing, and time will not 
turn back. 

CCAS: I would like to make some 
closing remarks. First I w ant to extend 
our thanks, to Premier Chou, 
and comrades Chang and Yau from 
the central Committee. We firmly be-
lieve again that the real heroes of the 
anti-imperialist struggle in Asia are in 
fact the Asian people- the Indochin-
ese people, the Korean people, and the 
Chinese people. 

P. Chou: But if you make efforts, you 
will become world heroes. 

CCAS: I would like to present some 
symbols to our Chinese friends here, 
similar to what we have presented as 
gifts everywhere. There are two sym-
bols. One is a photograph of our group. 
The other is a button. On both of these 
symbols is written, "Long live the 
friendship of the Chinese and American 
peoples." (applause) And on both of 
these can be found a peace symbol. 

Chou: That is our final aim.e
