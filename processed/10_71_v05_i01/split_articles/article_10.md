and Grendel's mother). Finally, Gard-
ner makes Grendel a sensitive, suffer-
ing, self-conscious being, capable of 
expressing himself playfully, poeti-
cally: Portnoy in the sixth century, 
or Frankenstein's Creature in a pre-
vious incarnation. Here I join the re-
viewers. Obviously this playful poet-
ic!' business was fun for the author. Fun, 
fun, fun. Author, author, author. But 
where did the narra.ting character go? 
What do you read, my lord? ('Gren-
del, has it occurred to you my dear 
that you are crazy?' I Gardner, has it 
occurred to you my dear that you 
are too damn clever?) It could be 
argued that much Old English poetry 
is no less consciously poetic than much 
of this novel, that Gardner is simply 
imitating his 'auctoritee' (a good 
medieval trait). Nonetheless ... 

The book centers on Grendel's' 
immediate problems (and he has 
plenty of them) with all the o ther 
characters. They arise from a central 
complex of causes; Grendel is the e-
ternal adolescent, alienated, s·uffering, 
longing. He states his 'philosophy' in 
chapter two: 
:tunderstood that this world was 
nothing: a mechanical chaos of casual, 
brute enmity on which we stupidly -
• 
impose our hopes and fears. I under-
stood that, finally and absolutely, I 
alone exist. All the rest, I saw. is mere-
ly what pushes me, or what I push 
against, blindly -as blindly as all that 
is not myself pushes back. I create the 
whole universe, blink by blink. -An 
ugly god pitifully dying in a tree! 

He spends most of the rest of the 
novel informing us how and why he 
has developed this view. which he 
never chan('.!S but merely elaborates 
parts of: Thus, just before he dies, 
Grendel blames his defeat on his acci-
dentally having slipped on blood when 
he attempted to kick Beowulf away: 
"It was an accident," I bellow back. 
I will cling to what is true. " Blind, 
mindless, mechanical. Mere logic of 
chance." 

And his dying words to the 'evil, in-
credibly stupid' animals who stand 
around watching him die are, typically 
"Poor Grendel's had an accident.. .. 
So may you all. " 

Gardner redeems this potentially 
leaden viewpoint by Grendel's mer-
curial shifts in tone. Whenever he be-
comes too serious, Grendel always 
deflates himself, in a manner 
reminiscent of Byron. (Another game 
-.Byron wrote Cain and identified 
with the hero: Grendel, being of the 
race of Cain, is often Don Juanishly 
Byronic.).As Byron says, 'if a writer 
should be quite consistent./How could 
he possibly show things existent?' 

,Inconsistent Grendel is very much 
concerned with things existent, and 
he is very much afraid of succumbing 
to words that presume to change the 
real world but that operate only in 
the speaker's or listener's imaginatio_n: 
I couldn't go on, too conscious all at 
once of my whimpering, my eternal 
posturing, always t ransforming the 
world with words - changing nothing. 

But he also wants the fictions, the 
wordish lies, and he finally accepts 
men's greatest fiction, the story of 
Cain and Abel, as the basis for his 
identity. (Like all true adolescents, 
Grendel is suffering from an 'identity 
crisis.') Whereas before Grendel had 
tried to make friends with man occa-
sionally, he now becomes 'the out-
cast, cursed by the rules of [man's] 
hideous fable.' He becomes the 
Destroyer. 

Grendel is made aware of this 
imaginative power in words only after 
he hears theppoems of the Shaper, the 
blind old poet. (Grendel is always 
spying on the humans, of course.) 
Poetry brings to Grendel his first epi-
phany, his first awareness of something 
other than either caves or mead-halls, 
his first vision of what man can be. 

To resolve the confusion this 
knowledge causes he seeks out the 
dragon, who turns out to be (for me) 
the book's most amusing character. 
The dragon, like God, sees all time and 
space; he gives Grendel lectures on 
Free Will and intercession (parodying 
Boethius), on the folly of human rea-
son,.on Time and Space. He draws two 
conclusions: 

"Things come and go," he said. 
"That's the gist of it. In a billion 
billion billion years, everything will 
have come and gone several times, 
in various forms. Even I will be 
gone. A certain man will absurdly 
ki ll me. A terrible pity - loss of a 
remarkable form of life. Conserva-
tionists will howl." He chuckled 
"Meaningless, however." 

2 'Know thyself.' that's my dictum. 
Know pow much you've got, and 
beware of strangers!" 

Dragons by nature collect precious 
things and lie on them and are ex -
tremely suspicious; thus number two.) 
The only advice he gives Grendel is 
that he should accept his fabled 
identity: 

• You improve [men] , my boy!. .. 
You make them think and scheme. 
You drive them to poetry, science, 
religion, all that makes them what 
they are for as long as they last. You 
are, so to speak, the brute existent 
by which they learn to define them· 
selves." 

He also gives Grendel an invulnerable 
hide, which is far more practical since
