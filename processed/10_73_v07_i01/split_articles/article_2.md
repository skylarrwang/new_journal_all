An Interview with Vincent Scully

Bold,opinionoted,quick-witted,academic, 
indulgent,overflowing,theatrical,brilliant, 
compassionate: Vincent Scully came 
back to Yale this faU,stretched and 
reshaped by a years sabbatical in 
Europe, but still the same magnet of a 
man he has always been. Scully has 
returned to his native New Halien to 
resume his Mastership of Morse College 
and refresh Yale with his dramatic 
lectures,stabbing the projection screen 
with a smaller pointer now- the big one 
was stolen. He enjoys the interaction 
once more;it helps him think. 

His most recent book,Pueblo:Mountain 
Village Dance (to be published next 
March by Viking Press),deals with 
Pueblo culture and architecture in Taos 
and Santo Domingo ,New Mexico.He 
spent some time in Europe trying to 
transcribe a number of his lectures into 
another book- but found it an impos-
sible task. He discovered that he could 
not forge his lecture style into his 
writing style.lndeed,he must have found 
that nothing is quite like listening to 
Vince Scully speak: 

Well, I think Yale made a great mistake 
in not having a real plan for this place. 
I guess they did have one, but paid no 
attention to it . For a long time they 
just built hit or miss, wherever they could 
get the land. It was typical of what 
Whitney Griswold, who was a wonderful 
president, thought about architecture 
in the fifites. The idea was to get the 
most outstanding architects and let 
them do what they wanted to do. 

I'm not really happy with most of 
Yale's modem architecture. I don't 
think on the whole that it's up to the 
older buildings here, especially in the 
creation of environments. Morse College, 
for example, is really a very bad solution 
to the problem of housing. The minimal 
facilities we have-the common room 
which is just a left-over basement space-
it's really not right. The accomodations 
are much too cramped. The lighting 
and the special details which were 
designed at vast expense, just don't 
work. 

liQuid you say that it is elitist 
architecture? 

Well, it's not good elitist architecture. 
I'm all for elitist art-that's what I 
believe in. But again it's typical of the 
decade. In the fifties everybody was 
trying to knock everybody else's eye 
out. I think that's very typical of Paul 
Rudolph's Art and Architecture 
Building. He tried so hard just to outdo 
Corbusier, to outdo the Greeks in terms 
of sculptural mass. 

And I'm responsible, too. That's the 
way I thought in the fifties. We all 
thought in terms of this heroic con-
frontation thing. It's the kind of 
thinking that started Kennedy off 
meddling about in Vietnam, exactly 
the same attitude. His inaugural speech 
was the equivalent of the Art and 
Architecture building, in a sense. That 
same quality of the heroic astronaut. I 
dislike it a lot in modern architecture. 

I think the best modem building at 
Yale was the. very first-Kahn's art 
gallery. It's in a way the least pre-
tentious. That building's got a probity, 
a solemnity that I think is really very 
good. Without a doubt the worst one 
is the Beinecke. It's a terrible thing 
to beat a building, kind of like hitting 
a chilo. But the Beinecke is a real 
honor, in my opinion. It destroys the 
center of Yale. We could have had a 
beautiful glass tower by Mies set in a 
circle of masonry buildings that would 
have been a jewel. It would have been 
beautiful. Why they ever commissioned 
that building I just don't know. 

H-71at happened to New Haven during 
the Lee-Griswold era? What produced 
the change to downtown redevelopment? 

I think again it's that sort of heroic view 
of the fifties: We know what's good for 
you, but you don't, so we'll push the 
populations out. They did, too. They 
brought in luxury apartments where 
there had been low-income housing. 
They cleared out so many areas of the 
city where a nice sort of modest life 
was going on. All those wonderful 
shops on State street. Oak street, 
that great shopping area along there-
Jewish delicatessens and so on, the 
kind of thing you just don't find here 
anymore. They were proud to get rid 
of the flea markets that were going on 
over there, proud to announce that 
now we have Chapel Square Mall in-
stead. They had a really stupidly gen-
teel view of what was going to happen 
to the city. 

And then, of course, they didn't com-
plete what they set out to do! The 
citizens began to block it, the funds 
ran out. And now Nixon has starved 
everything to do with the cities. So 
now we have these great waste areas 
like on State street ... 

When I came back to it this time, New 
Haven really looked sad. Somehow 
it looked depressed. It looked droopy. 
It looked dirty. As a matter of fact, the 
whole United States looks awfully 
tacky. Do you get that feeling? Com-
ing apart physically. Yale University, 
too, is not what it used to be. All of 
us used to be appalled at the amount 
of money they spent keeping the 
grounds up. But when you let them go 
a little bit, you see how important that 
all really was. 

Everything around New Haven-from 
the taxi cabs to the way they keep up 
the Merritt Parkway to the neighbor-
hoods-everything gives you the curious 
feeling that we have run out our string. 
we've run out of money, we've run out 
of skills, run out of patience. It may 
have been because I was living in Swit-
zerland, where everything is so neat, so 
tidy. But New Haven does have, right 
at this moment, the look of an absolute 
disaster area. 

Is this a failing of the way we approach 
modem architecture? Have we failed to 
ask the right questions? 

I think it's typical of what's happening 
to us sociologically in this country. Peo-
ple are moving out of the cities, into the 
suburbs. They're driving their own cars. 
So we get more and more highways, more 
and more suburbs. The centers of the 
cities decay, they fill up with the poor 
population that is forced to live there. 
It's just a tragic thing. 

But it seems to me probably inevitable, 
in terms of the suburban living pattern 
and the automobile culture. It seems to 
be the way the United States is going. and 
the way most populations of the world 
go when they get a chance. France will 
go that way-they're ripping Paris apart to 
put in more superhighways along the 
Seine. Frenchmen are moving out into the 
landscape. And Italy, my goodness, Italy 
is running to superhighways. Up through 
the Abrizzi and the unspoiled mountain 
country they run, with all the junk fol-
lowing them. It's a scandal. They're spoil-
ing one of the greatest, most savage, 
archaic, beautiful landscapes- cultures- in 
the world up there. We're just ahead 
of them, that's all. 

But were changing now. The people 
in San Francisco got together to say 
"Stop building" ... 

Yes, that was great. New Haven; too. 
And I suspect it will continue. I think 
the whole physical plant is running 
down. Look at the automobiles, now-
they can hardly run with all those anti-
pollution devices on them. You get 
about two miles to the gallon, they 
choke, and pook! the whole thing is 
falling apart. 

I do think that soon, in specific places 
like New York but eventually in a lot 
of places, the automobile is just not 
going to be useful any more. You're 
already better off in New York without 
one. I think that will soon be the case 
in New Haven. But what has to come 
back is what New York never lost, but 
what other cities have lost completely-
public transportation systems. I think 
the money that comes in through high-
ways and tolls and taxes should go, not 
to roads-no more of that-but to mass 
transit. Bus lines, railroads .... The rail-
roads are stiU the most efficient way to 
move men and goods fast and economi-
cally-but they're in the worst trouble 
of all. 

What happens, though, when people 
don't realize the need for things like 
mass transit? 

That's a real problem. The whole cul-
ture might fall apart.
