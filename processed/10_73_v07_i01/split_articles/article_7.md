Buffalo and Buildings 
(continued from page 4) 
ric and contemporary, to the sacred natu-
ral formations. And the ritual is still go-
ing on there. That's what I worked on-
the sacred mountains, the relation of the 
Pueblos to them and the relation of their 
dances to the man-made and the natural. 
There's an awful lot about dancing in it. 
The greatest dances I have seen are in 
the great pueblo of Santo Domingo, 
where two enormous events take place. 
One is the great com dance in the sum-
mer where the whole pueblo is dancing-
hundreds and hundreds of dancers. The 
whole group is moving like a great field 
of com, like an army. Sophocles has a 
chorus in Oedipus at Co/onus say: "the 
olive fertile and self-sown, the terror of 
our enemies." The corn is like that, it is 
the power of the pueblos. It's through 
the com that they can live close together 
and have the strength of their communi-
ty. And so these dances, these great files 
and lines of dancers, are just terrific. 

The other great type ot dance, which 
they have in the winter, are the animal 
dances. Especially the buffalo dances, 
where the dancers have got to be a lot 
like Â·the animal chorus of Dionysus. Out 
of which, in a view to which Aristotle 
and I subscribe, Greek drama derives. 
An animal steps forward from the chorus 
to oppose it with his will. In the Pueblo 
dance, it's the buffalo that opposes the 
whole movement of the chorus and the 
whole rhythm of nature. Animals like 
the elk dance bent over with two sticks 
for front legs. But the buffalo think they 
are the hunters. They dance like men, 
bow in one hand, rattle in the other. They 
dance up and down the ftles of animals, 
count coup on them with the bow, then 
bring them back to life again with the 
rattle and they all dance together. 

This dance really makes you feel the 
immortality of the herds. One is shot 
down and another, exactly like the other 
one in the eyes of men, takes its place. 
You can feel how animals were made 
gods in prehistoric times, you really can. 
In Domingo, especially, they dance all 
day. About the middle of the afternoon 
the buffalo begin to become aware 
that they are going to die, too, that they 
they're not just the hunter, but also the 
hunted. Then they may tum against the 
cho~these hundreds of people with 
many drums and rifles filled with blanks 
that they fue ofT as the buffalo tum 
against them. And while there are only 
two buffalo, normally, those two with 
their manes and their horns give the im-
pression of a whole herd. You can really 
see it all movio g. 

Between the buffalo dances the buffalo 
maiden. who carries an evergreen bundle 
in her hand. She is really Artemis, the 
mother of the beast and of the animals. 
She is also Nature, she's the Law, and she 
keeps them dancing to their fate. When 
they learn that they're going to die, some-
times they tum and try to escape from 
the plaza. She reaches out with her bun-

dle and she brings them back, and they 
pick up their rhythm again. It's tremen-
dous, it's just murder. 

lsn 't the scope of your work then really 
more than just art history? lsn 't it almost 
anthropology? 

Yes, both in the work in Greece and with 
the Pueblo I push toward anthropology. 
But I'm no anthropologist. I really do it 
through art history. When I'm dealing 
with dance I do it like an art historian, be-
cause I really don't know anything about 
music and I can't pretend that I do. I 
love the Indian music, though, and I 
really try to describe it the best I can as I 
would any work of art, any plastic form. 
I think it's still art history, but there is a 
lot of ethnographic material involved that 
I try to deal with. 

Do you approach your work like an 
ethnographer, getting out and speaking 
with the people? 

I hate to ask them questions. I really feel 
like a fmk, sitting there peeking like a 
voyeur at their culture. But I approach it 
the way I would any work of art. I try 
to learn it as much as I can in its cultural 
context, in the context of the people who 
made it. But on the other hand it exists 
outside that, too. It exists outside time. 
lhere's no veil between it and the observer 
when he sees it. And it has meaninp far 
beyond those that might have been inten-
ded. No work of art is the simple sum of 
the intentions of the artist. Otherwise 
there would be no work of art-you 
would just write down your intentions. 
1he work of art transcends that and de-
velops all kinds of meanings as it affects 
different observers. I think that's the 
difference between art history and anthro-
anthropology or archaeology. 

The art historian has the responsibility 
to deal with that other dimension-the 
work of art as it's experienced in each 
generation, as it changes, as it affects 
other forms, as it acquires meanings that 
were not intended by its makers. It's 
the responsibility of the archaeologist to 
place the artifact frrmly within the matrix 
of its culture. lhere he stops. The art 
historian should do that if he can, or 
should profit by the ability of the archae-
ologist to do it. But he should also be 
able to deal with it in the other context, 
too-its undying and constantly changing 
life in the history of mankind. 

Do you as an art historian ever feel the 
urge to create art rather than study it? 

No. But I love to draw. And I used to 
design houses a lot. But I'm not a disap-
pointed painter, sculptor or architect. My 
passion goes into the history of what's 
around. I'm a critic on that story. So 
I don't feel in any way frustrated. I'm 
not doing this instead of the other. I am 
verbal, that's why I majored in English 
in c:oUe!J'. I always wanted to write. My 
basic method of expression is with words. 

Have you ever made any attempts at 
aeative writing? 

Yeah, recently I started writing. In a 
typical American way I started writing 
right out of my memories of boyhood. 
But I don't like writing like that. I found 
that when I tried to write stories or no-
vels I couldn't think of plots or anything. 
I need the great works of art to make 
contact with reality. I need them badly, 
and they start me. They tell me about 
reality, and I try to capture that. A$ a 
teacher I guess I try to explain it. That's 
a terrible word, but I guess it has to be 
used. On the other hand, one has to ex-
plain works of art in ways that don't de-
stroy works of art. Now of course you 
can't destroy works of art with even the 
worst, dreariest explanation, but maybe 
you can destroy it for your listeners, 
temporarily, and that is the most terrible 
thing. 

You have to use words that are comple-
ments to the work of art, if possible, 
words that are as true as you can make 
them about what you see. Words that are 
as historically true as possible in terms of 
what we know of the artist's intentions 
and of the cultural matrix. Words which 
can engage in a verbal reaction to the 
physical stimulus, which is one of the 
things art history ought to be about, es-
pecially from the aesthetic point of view. 
From the point of view of deriving mean-
ing from experience, art history's function 
ought to be to bring words to bear upon 
physical objects in a way that enhances 
the intensity of meaning we derive from 
both. 

Do you ever find it difficult to put what 
you get from the visual experience of a 
work of art into verbal terms, into words? 

Oh, sure. lbat's what the craft of this 
profession involves. It's constantly trying 
to do that and constantly trying to do it 
better. lbat's what one works at more 
than anything else in writing and lectwing. 
Sure, it's difficult, but it is the challenge. 

Do you try to explain aTt to your students, 
01' do you try to direct them into it? 

Yes, weD, it's certainly directing them.
