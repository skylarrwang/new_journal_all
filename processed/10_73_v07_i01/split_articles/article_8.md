Obviously a course such as History of 
Art 12 is not just a list of names, dates 
and places. I hardly stress those at all. 
Although we do hold the students re-
sponsible for them, just simply so that 
there is the respect for history, for the 
chronology, for the object, and for pre-
cise, solid fact. But on the other hand 
the major purpose of the course should 
be a simple beginning in acquiring a 
passion for and a confidence in the pro-
cess of seeing and derivinR meanin2 
from that. And connecting this process 
in fact, with the fundamental problems. 
of human life. 

To start art, a course in the history of 
art, do you feel it is necessary to start 
at the beginning, with the cave paintings? 
That's a good question. I start my 
course that way becasue I have confidence 
in history. I start with some introductory 
lectures on the arts which are also 
chronological-they go right through 
history from the beginning to the 
present. That's because I do believe 
that you can trace the development, 
the unfolding of human art historically. 
And I think that when you take it 
historically, you're in the soundest 
position to develop the concepts of 
art a.s in fact they developed in human 
history itself. Now when I say develop-
ment, I don't mean improvement. I 
don't even mean it gets more complex. 
Probably there has never been an art as 
complex as the cave painting with its 
fantastic sets of imagery. I haven't the 
slightest idea of what it's all about. 

So yes, I do believe that the chron-
ological way is the right way. 

Do you see yourself identifying with 
the cultures you study, the ancient 
Greeks and the Indians at Taos and 
Santo Domingo? 

Yes, I do. It is schizophrenic, isn't it? 
You see, though, in art, in literature, 
anything like that, the point is that in 
them, through them, human beings have 
many lives, and live in many kinds of 
time, many kinds of worlds. The 
liberal arts are liberating arts. They 
liberate us from a place and space and 
time. They allow us to live in many 
families and in many landscapes. It's 
hard to do, because you have to work 
terribly hard intellectually and 
emotionally--there's no difference 
between those two. Anyone who thinks 
there is is making a great mistake. 

You have to work to feel and to think 
your way into it, and that's very 
difficult. You don't live in another 
time if you make a quick trip to 
the Gothic cathedrals and take a few 
quick pictures and say "Gee, that's 
pretty." You've got to dig. And it 
takes a long time--same with ideas. But 
when you do dig, you can begin just 
a little bit to live in many kinds of worlds. 
And I think that's why history, and in 
this particular case art history, is so 
much a basic fact of modern life. It's 
one of the good things--there may be a 
lot of bad things in modern life--one of 
the good things is that we have been 
liberated by history to live in many 
kinds 
ofworlds. 0
