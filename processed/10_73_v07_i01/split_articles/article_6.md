From the people who brought you the face of God ...

<t • -~ -., 
Two years ago the Yale Marching Band, 
bankrupt and leaderless, brought us the 
face of God. Now, invigorated by new 
funds and a new director, they still face 
their possible last judgement every week. 
Yet their message, if you can find it, is 
the same. 

Welcome, ladies, gentlemen, and Mr. 
Chauncey. For your pleasure today, we 
'Were going to present Catherine the 
Great singing "Nobody Knows the 
Trouble I've Seen," but she met with a 
crushing equestrian accident, and couldn't 
make it. So, instead, we present the 1973 
version of the World's Oldest Marching 
Band, the Yale Precision Marching Elec-
tric Rainbow. Head Cretin: Keith Brion. 
Near-Cretin: David Perlman. Imprimator: 
Sam Chauncey. And introducing Luscious 
Lori and the Human Hormones. 

Today we salute Sam Chauncey, class 
of '57, the little known and less appre-
ciated Secretary of Yale University. (play 
Another Opening, Another Show) 

To begin with, we introduce a weekly 
column dedicated to answering every-
thing you wanted to ask about Yale, but 
were afraid to know: "Band Slanders". 
This week's question reads: Dear Band, 
How large is Sam Chauncey's office? 
Band says: Sam Chauncey's office is so 
small that he has to go outside to change 
his mind. Luckily his mind is narrow 
enough to fit through the door. (play 
Great Gate of Kiev and form door} 

In previous years, the Yale Precision 
Marching Band's unexpurgated shows 
have wreaked havoc upon the streets of 
New Haven. That was before Sam 
Chauncey took the bull by the tail and 
foced the situation. Now the band shows 
simply reek. In honor of Sam's bull, the 
band forms the situation (a large zero} 
and plays Conquistador. 

Aside from censorship, Sam has many 
other functions. As soon as he figures 
them out, 'We'll dedicate a song to them. 
Yale Band halftime show, 
Sept. 29, 1973 

A few weeks ago Henry "Sam" 
Chauncey III, Secretary of the Univer-
sity, told the Yale University Marching 
Band that if they performed one more 
"bathroom joke" in the Yale Bowl their 
act would be cancelled and replaced by 
local high school bands. 

Last Saturday Chauncey and Univer-
sity President Kingman Brewster were 
watching the show carefully from their · 
ftfty yard line seats to se-e how the new 
policy worked. The newly-domesticated 
band marched into the center of the 
field, and "in honor of Sam's bull," 
formed the bovine's ass and played "Con-
quistador." 

They then formed a fire hydrant and 
played the Foot lifter March, appro-
priately dedicated to the huskie dogs of 
the University of Connecticut. 

And after all that Brewster shook 
Chauncey's hand and the smiling secre-
tary flashed the "V" sign to photogra-
phers. Perhaps he was proud to be The 
Man Who Made The Band Give Up That 
Old Bathroom Humor. (They were 
finally getting into healthy things like 
asses and urine.) Or maybe he was just 
relieved that at least it was obscure 
enough to get past the locals in the 
stands. 

After the show Chauncey said the 
band was safe for at least another week. 
He said he didn't mind the aperture 
formed on the field , the fire hydrant, or 
even the joke about Catherine the Great's 
equestrian accident. "We don't look for it 
if we don't see it," he said, "If you know 
what I mean." 

His sentiment was echoed by Band 
President Tom Olcott, '74, one of the 
authors of Saturday's script. "We knew 
the script was safe," he said. "We 
figured if someone was perverted enough 
to figure out the jokes, they had no right 
to act offended." 

Brewster, too, was pleased. After the 
game he was asked what he thought of 
the "new Band." "They were splendid," 
he said as his wife chuckled at the ques-
tion. "How about their new sound?" the 
reporter asked, referring to the electric 
guitars featured in the show. "I've made 
my comment," Brewster said, "with all 
its amplifications." 

Chauncey's small victory last week 
is only phase one of a long series of 
changes he hopes to make to improve 
Yale's strained relations with New 
Haven- a 200-plus year old problem that 
became a multi-million dollar issue last 
spring when the Board of Aldermen 
turned down the University's bid to 
build two new residential colleges. 

Chauncey hopes Yale can make 
friends with the city-without making 
major concessions on Yale's tax-exempt 
status- by making minor concessions like 
muzzling the Yale Band, accepting more 
New Haven applicants, and getting Yale 
students to register and pay property tax 
on the cars they keep in the city. 

Chauncey estimates that more than 60 
per cent of the fans in the Bowl each 
week are area residents and Yale alumni, 
both of whom are frequent and vehement 
critics of the Band's "less than tasteful" 
halftime shows. 

"I don't like censorship," Chauncey 
says, "In fact, personally I'm not 
otTended by anything. I've been working 
with students for so long that I've 
become, well, let's say flexible. But some 
very reasonable people have written us 
complaining about the Band's bad taste 
and I can see their point. That's why 
we're making this change." 

Aside from general complaints about 
the Band's allegedly bad taste and slov-
enly appearance, some alumni have even 
threatened to cut off imancial support 
for the University because the Band shows 
are so offensive. One alumnus wrote: "We 
are interested in giving our monies to 
help educate young ladies and gentlemen 
and not a group that look and act like 
sluts and slobs." 

Another, the head of a 20 year 
reunion fund drive, said it was hard 
enough to raise money these days with-
out having to apologize for a band that 
was "disgusting, anti-President, anti-
morals. anti-evervthintt." 

With a $400 million capital improve-
ment fund drive due to begin early 
next year, the administration is anxious 
to appease rich alumni with an aversion 
to poor taste. 

In addition, Yale administrators and 
New Haven Mayor Bart Guida have 
received hundreds of letters from city

residents complaining about the Yale 
Band. ChaWlcey said that although Guida 
himself has never complained about the 
Band, he was very pleased when Yale 
told him about the new censorship. 

.. lltere's no question that the Band has 
hurt our relations with New Haven," 
ChaWlcey said. "For example, we used 
to give a lot of free football tickets to 
area youth groups, like the cub scouts, 
but after one really bad halftime show a 
cub scout leader wrote us and told us we 
oould keep the tickets." 

"I've given the problem a lot of 
thought," Chauncey said, "and I've fin-
ally decided that the only solution is to 
have the Band cut out all sexual or dirty 
humor entirely. I know we may also be 
cutting out some jokes that might not be 
offensive, but l don't think there's any 
other way. I've made my decision and rm 
willing to take flak for it. But if the Band 
passes these limits, they won't play 
again." 

ChaWlcey's do~r-die threat is an 
abandonment of the forrner, largely 
ineffective policy of having Yale College 
Dean John Wilkinson edit each show 
before the game. Wilkinson's censorship 
of the Band began in 1969 when the 
Band, in mocking two University of Con-
necticut athletes who were charged with 
breaking and entering, marched from a 
"UCONN" formation into "UCONS." 

But Wilkinson, now on leave, was 
unable to control the Band. "Sometimes 
the script would take on new meanings 
when the announcer read it at the game," 
Chauncey explained, "and sometimes 
they'd just change the script after 
Wilkinson approved it." 

During the Wilkinson years the Band 
got away with lines like "Benjamin 
Franklin, the foWlder of the University 
of Pennsylvania, attained considerable 
popularity as ambassador to the French 
court. The Yale Band wo nders what could 
have attracted the Parisian ladies to the 
old invento r. Was it his lightning rod? Or 
was it just o ne of those things?" At the 
197 1 Harvard game the Band dedicated a 
sona,.!o the Radcliffe women, who 
"in- accordance with an o ld Massachusetts 
custom, are rewarded with a scarlet letter 
for making the Crimson teams." 

The Band admits they got away with 
some outrageous shows under Wtlkinson, 
including the infamous "Yes, We Have 
No Bananas" salute to the then un-
coeducated Dartmouth. But they claim 
Wilkinson wreaked some havoc of his 
own at times. 

On one occasion, the Band claims, 
Wilkmson rejected a show the da> before 
an away game at Pennsylvania and the Band had to write a new 
show during the bus ride to Philadelphia. 
En route they pulled into a Howard John-
son's on the New Jersey Turnpike and 
practiced the new formations in the 
parking lot. 

After Wilkinson rejected another script 
later in the season, the Band dedicated 
a show to the .. Wilkinson blades" of 
censorship, asking " Why won't Gillette 
us be?" and explaining to the fans that 
the " Personna non grata" thought all the 
Band shows were "full of Schick." 

Some band members feel there 
should be no censorship at all. lltey say 
their irreverence is good for student 
morale and is a healthy addition to Yale's 
staid image. ln a letter to an angry 
alumnus, last year's Band conductor 
Bryan Simms wrote " The band genuinely 
does not intend to offend spectators at 
the game. We only ask that you share our 
spirit of diversion and humor." 

Even the drum major of the Univer-
sity of Connecticut band, Dudley Hamlin, 
74, grants the 'nlle Band "its style, for 
what it's worth." He says his own band, 
which is twice as big as the 90-member 
Yale Band and which marches in the Big 
Ten band style, " has too much class to be 
funny on the fleld." "But if people can't 
take college-level humor" he adds, " they 
shouldn't be in college-level places." 

But New Haven residents and alumni 
continue to outnumber Yale students at 
the Bowl, and their criticism of the Yale 
Band has been a growing problem for 
Yale administrators in recent years. ln 
most cases, Yale administrators have 
apologized and confided to even the 
most enraged critics that they agree. 

When one alumnus, class of '30, wrote 
.. The Band must give thousands pause 
when they consider continued support," 
Jo nathan Fanton, Assistant to the Presi-
dent, replied ••1 share your dismay about 
the Yale University Marching Band and it 
does seem to me that its appearance has 
deteriorated over the past two or three 
years. I hope we can reverse this trend." 

When another alumnus wrote " It has 
always been· my contentio n that if you're 
going to tell a dirty joke, it had better be 
funny, and the script that is written for 
these weekly displays would be more 
appropriate if inscribed on the walls of a 
public toilet," a Yale administrator 
scrawled .. A very reasonable letter, in my 
view" at the top of the sheet. 

For some alumni, however, the taste-
lessness of the Yale Band has even a 
historic significance. "This may be the 
pornographic age," a member of the 
Volume seven, number one I October 7, 1973 I 11 
class of '46 wrote, "but I think the 
Band's officers last month to issue his 
reference to the male and female sex 
ultimatum, they were already planning a 
organs over the lo udspeaker to a parents-
tribute to birth control, complete with a 
day football crowd of 35,000 is in incred-
coat hanger formation (for the song 
ibly bad ta.ste. It seems to me that this 
" You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby," 
lack of respect for the University and its 
of course) the Trojan fight song, and a 
administration is the stuff of which future 
rendition of "I've Got Rhyt hm." "We 
uprisings are made." 

Although even the Band's script writers 
admit some of their shows drifted over 
that thin line of tastefulness, they insist 
that the band is basically a harmless, fun-
loving organization that entertains and 
enlivens students with its antics and o ut-
landish shows. 

"When I think of the Yale Band," said 
Ben Aldridge, '72, script-writer for the 
1971 Band, .. I think of the fun we had · 
and the people we made laugh. Uke the 
time the Band tried to do a period-time·,· 
show at a hockey game and almost got 
killed by the ice-scraping machine. Or the 
time we ran out of money and had to 
send the "Yale University Precision 
Marching Invisible Band" to the Brown·· 
game in Providence. 

••1 remember the stunned looks o n the 
faces when the drum major strutted o ut 
onto the fleld alone and anno uncer said . 
'Tile 16,000 members of the Yale Band 
now form the Taj Mahal, complete with 
reflecting pools, scores of naked dancing 
girls, and the Royal Ostrich Herd. Notice 
if you will the partial eclipse of the moon 
visible between the last two turrets on the 
left.' 

"The announcer was Jim Vasios- he's 
a parole officer in Hackensack now. The 
drum major moved around some more 
and Jim said •you ain't seen nothing yet. 
Moving quickly from its Indian Opulence, 
the Band's famous 17 member elite tacti-
cal squad captures the enigmatic smile 
of the Mona Usa ... while the 15,983 
lfandsmen form an appropriate back-
ground.' 

" But the last formation was the big 
one. •And now,' Jim said, •t.adies and 
gentlemen, for the ftrst time anywhere, 
the 'rate University Marching Invisible 
Band forms, on this very field ... the 
face of GOD!' We played~~ !_ape of 
Hail to the Chief over the lo udspeaker. 
The students loved it, but boy did we get 
letters." 

Band members tend to remember their 
glories and forget the shows about .. nip-
pers" and ··odd-balls" that got the angriest 
letters. Nevertheless, the fact that Sat-
urday's show caused such relief in the 
administration bears witness to the 
heights, or depths, of tastlessness the 
Band has reached in the past. 

ln fact, when Chauncey called in the 
didn't even bo ther asking about that 
one," Olcott said. 

Since the rrleeting with Chauncey, the 
script writers have become such avid self-
censors that they are even <lreaming 
about getting their show on regional 
T.V. when and if the American Broad-
casting Company televises the Yale-Penn 
game on Nov. 10. The band has offered to 
provide the network with a script before 
the game, but an ABC spokesman said 
they have not yet worked out their plans 
for the telecast . 

The netwo rk's caution might be 
traced to the last televised Yale foo tball 
game in 1969 when the 'nlle Band per-
fo rmed a salute to Aristotle Socrates 
Onassis on the air. After forrning the 
initials A.S.O . on the fleld, the band sat 
down and apparently refused to move. 
After a long pause the Yale annoWlcer 
said "Will the Yale Band please get its 
ASO off the field." The network switched 
quickly to a commercial, but not before 
Otris Schenkel was heard muttering "I 
can't believe they did that." 

Although Band members are excited 
by the idea of returning to mass rrledia, 
many have already expressed dismay o ver 
the willmgrless of the Band's officers to 
compromise with the administration. 

"Sure it's a sell~ut in a way," Olcott 
said. " I'm not pleased to have to submit 
but then I don't want to call ChaWlcey's 
bluff either." 

"It's depressing," trombonist Jim Warner, 
75 said. ••There used to be a real spirit in 
knowing yo u were pissing off the admin-
istration and getting away with it. I think 
the spirit's starting to go out of the 
Band.'' Another Band member com-
plained, " I really resent being used by the 
administratio n to buy two new colleges 
from New Haven." 

Some old-line Band membe~re even 
skeptical of their new director .~ ith 
Brion, who is friendly and conscientious, 
but defmitely intent on making the Band 
sound and look better. 

A high school band director in New 
Jersey for the past 11 years, Brion is 
combining some Big-Ten-type marching, 
dressing and playing discipline with some 
innovations like electric guitars to create 
a new Yale Band image.
