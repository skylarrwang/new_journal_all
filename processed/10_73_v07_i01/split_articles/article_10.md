The face of God... 
"Then what do you call that?" he 
(continued from page 11) 
replied, pointing to one of the Hormones 
ling about the stricter rules and heavier 
grinding out of the anus formation. 
work load, most admit they are proud of 
"Sure it's funny," another added with 
their improved sound, and no one has 
a blank face, "but this isn't the place for 
-threatened to quit. Mostly they can only 
humor." 

Outside the Bowl after the game an 
alumnus from Hartford shook his head 
in dismay at the 27-13 Y.lle loss to 
UConn, but stopped to cheer the Yale 
Band as it marched by on the way to 
their buses. 
"I was a little worried before the game 
when I heard a rumor that Y.lle was mak-
ing the band change its act," he said. 
••I'm glad to see it wasn't true." 

In Woodbridge Hall however the ef-
feet has already been felt. "It'; been at-
most a week," Chauncey said, "and not 
a single letter." o 
Chauncey and Brewster gave Bnon $1500 
from their ••discretionary" or personal 
office funds to pay for a new amplifier, 
an electric guitar, and other new instru-
ments. The generous administrators also 
threw in a new xerox machine, a face-
lifting for the delapidated band room, 
and even better seats for the Band at the 
Bowl--all for a group that had to reveal 
the face of God to Providence, Rhode 
Island two years ago because they 
couldn't scrape up the $200 needed for 
the bus. 

But Brion's plans to tame the Band are 
based on sincere hopes for the Band and 
not deals with the administration. " I 
think censorship is a silly, contrived 
issue," he said. "I'd be sorry to see them 
aroused over censorship when the real 
· issue is realizing their own potential. 
They've been priding themselves on being 
bad to compensate for the fact that they 
are bad." 

Still, Brion retains a healthy respect 
for the proud, if young traditions of the 
irreverent anti-band. For example, after 
Saturday's show Brion smiled and said 
"They marched pretty good. I wouldn't 
want them to get any better than that." 

Even more revealing, perhaps, is the 
fact that Brion has allowed "Luscious 
Lori" (Laitman, '75) to continue and 
even expand her act with the Band. Last 
year Luscious Lori made several names 
for herself by prancing around the field 
as voluptuously as she could, and 
hurling a baton aimlessly in the air. 
( .. Once I caught it by accident," she 
admits). This year two .. Human Hor-
mones" have joined her act. 

Luscious Lori, who claims it takes 
three grown men working ten minutes to 
get her into her costume-one on the 
zipper, two just pushing, puts no stock in 
this talk about alleged obscenity. "Parents 
aren't really offended by our shows," she 
says, .. They're just offended that their 
kids aren't offended." 

But while the debate over censorship 
rages, many untrained eyes have been 
missing out on the whole controversy. 
••That's supposed to be a new band?" 
one University of Connecticut band mem-
ber asked incredulously at the Bowl 
Saturday. 
••No more dirty jokes," a friend 
explained .
