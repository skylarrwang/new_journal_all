EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The automobile is a funny thing. I 
think the reason people like the automobile so much is because it gives them 
an illusion of freedom. You're usually 
by yourself in that great big stupid automobile and you feel like the pioneer-
like you're not involved with the rest 
of society. Of course this just isn't true 
when the fact that you drive on a road 
means that there's a highly organized 
society that you are sucking on. 
But in the automobile you have that 
sense of territoriality ... Did you ever 
think of the reason why one gets so annoyed when crowded in a car? You don't 
get annoyed if you get crowded on a train 
or a bus because you accept it as a public 
space. But in an automobile you feel like 
you're in your own house, you've got 
your own territory. And when another 
car comes closer that's a threat. Not 
just the threat of collision -you feel the 
aggression, the pressure of another person 
cutting into your territory. Of course 
these feelings are potentially so Duke 
Wayne-ish, so aggressive and violent .... 
I've heard policemen say that they think 
an enormous number of automobile accidents are really automobile murders. People 
lose their tempers and they smash .... 
You know, I've run the whole gamut 
on automobiles. While working with the 
Indians I used to drive out to New Mexico and back every summer. I finally got 
to be kind of a sucker for that imagery 
where you get behind the wheel of the 
old Chevy and drive ... 
Jack Kerouac's story ... 
Yeah, and Larry McMertry. But I really 
believe now that the automobile 
causes a sickness, a real sickness. It's a 
sick, rotten place for human beings to 
be. They're hot, they're smelly and 
they're dirty. The whole feeling an 
automobile gives you is one of spurious 
territoriality. It brings on this 
crushing and smashing of everything 
else worthwhile in the environment. 
I think it's archetypally the American 
sickness today. Only because we're 
first at it. Everybody else goes for it, 
given the chance-the French, the Italians, the Russians .... It's just that we're 
more modern. It's the modern sickness. I think it might end in destroying 
the environment. And worse than 
that it might destroy the ability of 
people to think in communal terms, and 
therefore to vote and behave intelligently. 
Do you feel that you can help avert 
this destruction? 
I've fought it hard in New Haven in 
the past, through public opposition and 
writing about it. But my attempts to 
change it have been a little ambivalent 
in the past because I've always felt the 
pull of the automobile. I really love 
the romanticism it suggests. 
I know if I get back in the Plains 
again-start "movin on," "cruisin"-- I 
might get back into it. That delicious 
old sickness which is best written about 
by Nabokov in Lolita. He's really much 
better than Kerouac. Maybe not before Kerouac, but doing what Kerouac 
never really did-giving you the sense 
of the whole furniture of the road 
culture, that is, the motel. Nabokov 
invented the motel as an image. And 
what is it but an image of absolute alienation? The lostness, the drifting of 
that poor girl who was being pursued 
by a villain, oh it's beautiful. 
In a way the motel, the Howard 
Johnson's or the Holiday Inn, seems 
to be a symbol of the need to retreat 
from the crush of automobiles ... 
That's right. But there's also an element 
of this territoriality thing. The motel 
is not like the old hotel, where you'd 
go in and register at the desk with 
everybody looking at you. It was a 
social thing. You had to be dressed 
right. And you had to be careful you 
were really married to the woman you 
were with 'cause they'd be watching 
with a thousand eyes. 
But in the motel, all that's dried up. 
One person goes in and signs, just says 
how many people are in the car, and off 
you go. You never see anybody. You go 
to your room, break out the Jack 
Daniels-they have the ice right there for 
you-and you sit there and you get 
stewed. The social interaction is absolutely gone. You're completely alone.
