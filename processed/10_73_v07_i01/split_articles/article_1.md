"Inconvenience, not catastrophy"
Everyone natwally approaches the sum-
mer term proposal through his or her 
particular role or interest in the Univer-
sity. The fund raiser may see an oppor-
tunity to convince potential givers that 
we are using .. the plant" to capacity 
and thus deserve support. Others see a 
means of attaining the fabled .. 60-40" 
ratio between the sexes in the under-
graduate student body without fwther 
reducing the number of men admitted. 
An academic innovator may welcome 
the chance to organize cowses along 
broad divisional lines in the summer, but 
a departmental director of undergraduate 
studies may despair over the disruptive 
impact on the normal sequence of 
cowses. Similarly, a residential college 
master tends first to contemplate the 
effect of a summer term on the institu-
tion which, from his perspective, is what 
gives Yale its distinctive character. 

College masters are both academic 
and administrative officers. At times 
the latter role crowds out the former. 
Especially at this time of year we may 
feel harrassed by problems connected 
with too many students in too few 
rooms, by difficulties in the physical 
operation of the college, or by the com-
plexities of internal accounting and bill-
ing within the University. 

At such times and from ow special 
points of view, it is hard to discover 
anything good about the summer term. 
We cry out that only those who have 
experienced the agonies of trying to 
make everyone happy with room assign-
ments, of fmding space for storage of 
student property, of listening to tales 
of property lost or stolen, can under-
stand the confusion that will result from 
the churning of students in and out of 
residence and from one college to 
another. We worry also about the impact 
of a summer population, composed 
mostly of students who do not belong 
to the college, on our cherished and 
already threadbare facilities. And we 
worry most of all about maintaining 
a sense of community when students 
will be here one term, gone the next. 
last spring a committee of residential 
college masters and deans presented• 
the Summer Term Committee with a 
memorandum voicing these concerns. 
The Committee Report is gratifying in 
its responsiveness. It proposes the 
appointment of a summertime adm~­
istrator for each college, and fmanctal 
assistance to meet new responsibilities 
and compensate for wear and tear on 
college facilities. It also holds out the 
possibility of converting the Old Cam-
pus into colleges at some distant date, 
so that all freshmen can live in their 
colleges from the beginning. The de-
parture of undergraduates from the 
college community for one term would 
be more than compensated by the in-
clusion of students in both terms of 
freshman year. 

It is not possible, however, to deal 
with aU the worries of those concerned 
about the residential college system 
without adding so much to the cost 
of summer operation that the fmancial 
gain-the proposal's primary objective-
would be seriously diminished or lost 
altogether. Thus, we are left with the 
necessity of weighing alternatives in the 
context of the University as a whole. 
'Th.e residential college system will sur-
vive a summer term, but no one can 
pretend that the colleges will be the 
better for it. 

It is foolish to view the proposal in 
apocalyptic terms. Year-round operation 
will not mark the end of civilization as 
we have known it at Yale. It may pro-
duce some inconvenience and irritation, 
but not catastrophy. It will not solve 
the University's frnancial problems, 
create an intellectual renaissance, satisfy 
aU those who want a different ratio 
of men to women students, convince 
every doubting alumnus that Yale is 
using its resources in the best possible 
way, or ensure the success of the cap-
ital fund drive. 

But it will probably yield some finan-
cial benefit, and it could well prove 
intellectually invigorating for students 
and faculty. We must make the decision 
whether or not to proceed after gather-
ing the most informed estimates about 
the summer term's impact, with the 
realization that estimates are not cer-
tairlties. My inclination is to go ahead 
if our estimates indicate that the gains 
outweigh the disadvantages by even 
a small margin.

"Share the poverty"
It is far from clear how much money a 
summer term would earn, but the Com-
mittee's report makes it plain that the 
cost to the quality of a Yale education 
would be considerable. There is no need 
to dwell on the difficulty of doing 
serious intellectual work in the heat and 
humidity of a typical New Haven sum-
mer in classrooms and dormitories not 
designed for summer use, but we should 
ru>t ignore the obvious. 

Even more serious than the climate, 
however, will be the short supply of 
teachers available. About 30% of the 
students will be there, but only 15% 
of the faculty. It is no satisfactory de-
fense to say, as the Committee does, 
that .. Since Yale College faculty mem-
bers now divide their teaching time 
roughly equally between graduate and 
undergraduate teaching" and since no 
graduate students will take summer 
cowses, the faculty-to-student ratio 
will be about the same. 

In the two departments I know best, 
History and Classics, the Committee's 
assumption is flatly wrong. This year 
80% of the courses taught by Classics 
professo~ will be open to under-
graduates. In History the figure is at 
least 70%. This means that the actual 
faculty-to-student ratio in these de-
partments will be far worse in the sum-
mer than in the other terms. 

But that is not all. Since graduate 
students will not attend the summer 
term, professors who teach mostly 
graduate courses will not be available 
tor the impoverished summer term. 
One-seventh of the faculty, of course, 
will teach in the summer. That means 
they will not teach in the winter. and 
enables us to make the summer term 
more comparable to the others by 
sharing the poverty. 

The Committee's response to the 
problem of faculty is to create a 
Divisional Model for the summer based 
on special Institutes. The models 
proposed in the Report group current 
cowses in artificial catagories. These 
cowses are typical Yale offerings, but 
very limited in scope and decked 
out in a fancy new package, something 
like eL-y breakfast cereal put into a 
box filled largely with air. 

The comparison, moreover, between 
the rnandatorv summer divisional model 
and such divisional programs as HAL, 
Politics and Economics, Cultwe and 
Behavior, and Directed Studies is invalid. 
These programs derive their success in no 
smill part from having the entire College 
fa"culty to draw on. lt is very hard to put 
together the faculty necessary to run 
these programs; sometimes the 
faculty is not as good as it should be, and 
sometimes the plan for the program is 
inadequate because o f the uncertainty 
concerning the available faculty. To be 
blunt, some of these programs are often 
statfed with junior faculty, often in their 
first teaching position, drafted irlto the 
program. Thus, there is no reason to 
think that the comparison with the 
summer ~ssion would be valid. 

Further problems are suggested by the 
description of the Center on Classical 
Greece. Two of the suggested courses 
provide illustrations. C. C. 12a, Greek 
Thought Through Aristotle, is a course 
central to work in Classics at Yale. If 
it were given in the summer with the 
presert staff it could not also be given 
in the winter. Would it be sensible to 
offer the course to 30% of ttK students
