**"Share the poverty" (continued from page 2)**

"Share the poverty" 
(continuedfrompage 2) 
rather than to 70%? Such a policy would 
seem to be self-defeating if economy is 
the lOal. This might be solved by 
additional staff for the Classics Depart-
ment, but if this case is at all typical, 
suflkient additions would be required 
to put the economy of the summer 
se11sion in doubt. 

Another example is Ancient History 
42b, Athenian Democracy. As it happens, 
thi.> course is taught by the only professor 
of Greek History at Yale. Once again it 
does not seem wise or economical to 
offer the course to 30% of the students 
and deprive the other 70% of the oppor-
tunity. Ancient History 42b illustrates yet 
anotner problem. The course is organized 
to include both undergraduate and 
graduate students. Experience has 
demonstrated that its clducational value 
is greatest that way. As it happens, this 
moc:'e of teaching is being strongly re-
commended now as an economy measure. 
Since there would be no graduate students 
attending courses in the summer, that 
course and any other course so organized 
could not be given in the summer. 

Eve.-yone knows that students do 
much of their learning from one another, 
especially do underclassmen learn from 
upperclassmen, and both learn from 
graduate stt~dents in their classes. The 
Committee proposes a summer term for 
fn:shmen and sophomores only. The 
qwdity of learning in such a term would 
be inc.omparably poorer than in a legiti-
mate semester. 

The proposed summer term would be 
a disappointing experience. The weather 
would be hostile to thought, the curric-
ulum narrow, the faculty inadequate in 
number and variety, the students deprived 
of the opportunity to learn from more 
experienced students--the whole thing 
a caricature 'of a reguln Yale education. 
Only the tuition fee will be up to Yale 
standards. 

Finally, it seems wrong to make the 
summer session mandatory for students. 
lf it is attractive it need not be mandatory 
lf it is mandatory, the Committee must 
assume it is not attractive. It ill also 
embarrassing, to say the least, that the 
program is mandatory for students but 
not for faculty. Why should the faculty 
not be equally required to enjoy this 
beneficial experience, or it it is not bene-
ficial, to suffer from its shortcomings? 
I should hate to have to justify this one-
sided approach either to students or to 
alumni.

**Strauss and Mahler: Death with/without transfiguration**
**Author: John Mauceri**

Strauss and Mahler 
Oeath with/without transfiguration 
Not long ago 1 heard the Yale Philhar-
monia's stunning first performance under 
the direction of Otto Werner MueUer: 
Joan Panetti's Between Mngs of Earth, 
Volume seven, number one I October 7, 1973 I 14 
Beethoven's Eroica, and Richard Strauss' 
Death and Transfiguration. It was a con-
cert about true grit, each piece being 
tough and victorious in a very stubborn 
way. Panetti's piece, at once passive and 
beautifully lyrical, proved its ability to 
survive by a few musical karate chops 
that told you it was here to stay. Beet-
hoven's well-known symphony needs no 
further description. It was the Strauss 
which kept returning to my thoughts 
that night - partly because of the per· 
suasive performance it had received, but 
also because I had been .. verkll'rt" the 
night before by the New York Philhar-
monic's performance of Arnold Schoen-
berg's Verklllrte Nacht (Transfigured 
Night) and Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathu· 
stra, in which I could explore the mystery 
of life and death under the guise of 
Nietzsche's philosophical rubrics. 

I have always disliked Strauss' Death 
and Transfiguration because it is unbear-
ably vulgar- not just superficially vulgar, 
but really vulgar. Only a brash post-
adolescent of 25 could have written about 
old age and death in such a way. For 
young Strauss, death had something to 
do with the physical horror of fluctua-
ting heart beats, perspiration, bed pans, 
and dirty sheets. It is all there in his 
m_.sic. 

At the same time as I was thinking 
about Strauss, I was working on Mahler's 
Adagio (to be performed at the Yale 
Symphony's first concert October 26) 
from his uncompleted last work, Sym-
phony No. 10. It is also a piece about 
death, but without transfiguration. In 
the Adagio one encounters the same 
subject matter as in Death and Trans· 
figuration, although this time it is from 
the vantage point of a man who, for all 
practical purposes, is dead already. 

While composing the Adagio, Mahler was 
in the third year of his death sentence: 
he had known since 1907 of his incu-
rable heart disease and he also knew he 
would complete only nine symphonies 
like Beethoven, Schubert, Dvorak and 
Bruckner. He could never complete 
something numbered ten, but he could 
try. 

Mahler teaches us that terminal illness 
is a psychological and not a physical 
problem. The dilemma is not that you 
creak in the morning; it is knowing that 
you will never eat another apple, or 
feel a snow flake on your tongue, or 
touch someone else's skin. To these 
things he says good-bye. As in Strauss' 
Death and Transfiguration, Mahler seems 
to relive happier moments from his life 
in the Adagio; and yet, the uselessness 
of struggle and the numbing certainty 
of death's incipience are awesome. It 
exists inevitably, absolutely, and without 
exception. Occasionally one senses in 
the Mahler work a certain excitement, 
perhaps evoked by this new adventure: 
death. But mostly he is terrified and 
comprehends for the first time what 
loneliness really is. 

Strauss, who was four years younger 
than Mahler, lived to be a very old man, 
dying in 1949 at the age of 85. His last 
works are four orchestral songs which 
explore death from a very different van-
tage point. While Mahler was terminally 
ill at the age of 47, Strauss lived a full, 
prosperous, and successful life. He had, 
in fact, lived so long that he saw his 
beloved Germany rise and fall twice. The 
most moving of his last songs ends with 
a theme from his Death and Transfigu-
ration, written a half-<;entury earlier be-
fore he really knew what he was writing 
about: "Mountains slope all around us 
and the sky already darkens ... How 
weary we are of wandering: is this 
perhaps--death?" For the aged Strauss, 
death is blessed and longed-for repose 
and not the violent and calamitous strug-
gle as seen by him in his youth. 

In the upcoming Yale Symphony con-
cert, Mahler's Adagio will rest between 
two works: Strauss' Festival Prelude 
for Organ and Orchestra ( 1913) and 
Stravinsky's Rite of Spring (1913). The 
point here is to explore the end of one 
era (Austro-German symphonic superio-
rity) and the simultaneous beginning of 
another (the barbaric color symphony 
school of the French and Russians). 

1llat the Strauss work was written for 
the opening of the Wiener Konzerthaus 
(where the Yale Symphony performed 
Bernstein's Mass last summer) is a nice 
personal touch. More important, how-
ever, is that it premiered within months 
of Stravinsky's epoch-shattering Rite 
and uses approximately the same size 
orchestra. Hearing these works on the 
same program should be quite startling. 

Strauss seemed completely unaware of 
how bankrupt his style had become by 
1913. Mahler, on the other hand, 
seemed to know very early (by his third 
symphony) that his now-over-blown 
post Wagnerian style had no possible 
expansion. He was right. The year of 
his death saw the first publications of 
the "new" Viennese school; that is, the 
;ttonal music of Arnold Schoenberg and 
his two brilliant pupils, Alban Berg and 
Anton Webem. Mahler's Adagio is not 
only a good-bye to his music making (he 
actually wrote these words in an agitated 
handwriting on the Adagio manuscript) 
but also a good-bye to his musical era. 
He knew in his own mind what personal 
and artistic annihilation was. When you 
hear his last work you may not cry, but 
you may find that your mouth uncon-
sciously has dropped in the presence of 
unspeakable reality.
