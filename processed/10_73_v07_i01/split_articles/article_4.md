When the Sons of Eli met Harvard 
in the first football game ever 
played in the Yale Bowl in 1914, 
the Bowl was a near wonder of the 
world: the largest stadium in 
existence, bigger than the Coliseum 
of Rome. It was a marvel of 
engineering, overwhelming in its 
dimensions, unique in its basic 
construction. 

But the fans who watch the New 
York Giants take on the Green Bay 
Packers in the Bowl today will not 
be awed by Yale's stadium like that 
first crowd which saw Harvard kick 
its way past Yale, 36-0. There are 
larger stadiums now, with better 
seats and lighting, expensive private 
lounges, artificial turf, brighter 
colors; the days of Yale's Walter 
Camp-the father of American 
football-are long gone. Yet, for the 
Giants, who will play their five-
game home schedule in their 
newly-adopted city of New Haven, 
the Yale Bowl is the most important stadium in the world right 
now. And for Yale, New Haven, 
and the history of caustic relations 
between the two, the significance 
of these five autumn Sundays 
will transcend the profits and 
prestige of being a major league 
town. For over the past seven 
months, the Yale Bowl has become 
a most important piece of real 
estate, where a prominent university, a major city, and a well-
followed professional sports team 
have all become apparent winners in a complex political and 
economic game. 

But why Yale? 
What makes Wellington Mara 
pull his Giant family away from 
the most devoted sports fans in 
the world to the wilds of Connecticut, where no one is really sure 
they belong and no one is sure 
sure they can stay? And what will 
happen to the New York-Haven-
Jersey Giants in three years if the 
Yale politicians no longer find 
them useful; if the New York politicians all hate them as much as 
John Lindsay does; and if the New 
Jersey politicians can't convince 
the taxpayers that their state 
should be in the business of building multi-million dollar sports 
complexes? 

As a mere one-state team, the 
Giants have been unhappy with 
their facilities at Yankee Stadium 
for some time. Built for the Yankees in 1923, the Stadium is a 
grand old affair-indeed, the Yale 
Bowl of the Bronx- but like the 
Bowl, it has fallen seriously behind 
in the boom of modern sports 
arenas. While the Stadium could 
seat 73,000 for baseball games, 
it could only seat 63,000 for football and many of those seats had 
obstructed views of the playing 
field. Parking space was inadequate 
and access to the stadium somewhat difficult. The facilities were 
badly in need of renovation. And 
the Giants were always playing 
second tenants behind the Bronx 
Bombers. 

Not that the Yankees were completely happy with the ballpark 
either. It was just that neither Rice 
University, who owned the stadium, 
nor the Knights of Columbus, who 
owned the land beneath it, could 
or would finance the needed improvements. Foreseeing that the 
stadium's condition might cause 
the Yankees or the Giants to leave 
the city a worried John Lindsay 
began to talk to the Yankees in 
mid-1970. After nine months of 
negotiating, the Mayor announced 
that the city would either purchase the stadium or acquire it 
through condemnation proceedings; he believed that $21 million 
of renovations would help persuade 
the two teams to remain in New 
York. Yankee President Michael 
Burke indicated that his team immediately would cease discussing 
a possible move to New Jersey. 
Three weeks later, he said that the 
Yankees would stay in New York 
for "30 years" if the renovations 
were undertaken. 

Wellington Mara, on the other 
hand, was not a man to be moved. 
Mara, who inherited the ownership 
of the Giants through his father (who reportedly was able 
to buy the team because of his 
successful bookie operations), refused to commit himself. While 
the imperious Irish owner was 
known for treating his team like 
family, he was also known for 
treating his public strictly as public- and sometimes with public 
contempt. Even before Lindsay's 
renovation announcement, the 
Giants had begun negotiating with 
New Jersey officials for a permanent home in East Rutherford. New 
Jersey Governor William Cahill was 
eager to lure professional teams 
to his state, not only for the business it would bring, but for the 
improvement of his state's public 
image: New York wouldn't have 
New Jersey to kick around anymore. 
Cahill was willing to offer very


attractive terms-and Mara was 
listening. The Governor strained 
already tender Giant-City relations 
by announcing in March, 1971, 
that he had a conditional commitment from the Giants for a move 
across the river. A month later, 
the New Jersey Legislature established a sports authority to plan 
a 750-acre sports complex costing 
between $100 million and $200 
million. The complex was to include separate baseball and football stadiums, a thoroughbred 
racing track, basketball and hockey 
facilities, and a separate convention 
hall. 

The official announcement came 
at the end of August: the Giants 
had signed a 30-year lease to play 
in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 
While at Yankee Stadium they had 
received no percentage of the concessions, parking or program revenues, they would get 10 percent 
of parking and half of the concessions profits in New Jersey. The 
sports complex would offer 75,000 
unobstructed seats for football, its 
own Jersey Turnpike exit, and 
extensive parking facilities. And 
although the Giants were changing 
states, their new home would only 
be one-and-a-half miles further 
from Times Square than is Yankee 
Stadium. 

Mara told the press that he was 
moving his team to give them their 
first real home in 46 years, and to 
provide comfort and convenience 
for those Giant fans who had suffered so long at the Stadium. The 
New York Times quoted him as 
saying: "New York is not losing a 
team, it's gaining a sports complex." 

There was only one problem: the 
New Jersey complex would not be 
completed until at least 1975, and 
the Giants needed a place to play 
their 1973 and 1974 "home" games 
while Yankee Stadium was undergoing renovation. The Mara family 
was not exactly popular in New 
York. ABC Sports commentator 
Howard Cosell came up to New 
Haven to call Mara names in front 
of a Yale Political Union audience. 
Lindsay declared that once the city 
obtained ownership of Yankee 
Stadium, the Giant's subletting 
contract automatically would be 
terminated. He vowed to go to 
court to prevent the Giants from 
retaining the City's name. And he 
contacted then-U.S. Congressman 
Emmanuel Cellar to inquire about 
initiating an antitrust investigation 
of pro football. Clearly, the possibility of sharing the City-owned 
Shea Stadium with the New York 
Jets did not seem likely. 

At first glance, the Yale Bowl 
seemed to offer the best temporary 
solution, even though 90 percent 
of the Giants' regular fans came 
from outside Connecticut. Other 
possibilities included West Point's 
Michie Stadium and Princeton's 
Palmer Stadium, as well as sites 
in Foxboro, Mass., Tampa, Fla., 
and their Jersey City practice 
field. But West Point did not 
want the Giants. And the Giants 
did not want Princeton-its stadium could not accommodate the 
60,000 Giant season ticket holders 
and there was a serious question 
as to whether the town could 
withstand the massive weekly 
influx of fans. The cost of expanding the Giants practice field 
facilities appeared prohibitive. 
Moving to Foxboro would be like 
moving the New York Rangers 
to the Boston Garden. And playing 
in Tampa would pose the threat 
of losing considerable ticket revenue as well as most of the Giants' 
present fans. By the spring of 
1973, it had become evident that 
unless the Giants wanted to play 
all their games on the road, their 
best option was quickly becoming 
their only real option. It was the 
Yale Bowl or bust. 

The Yale Bowl had the advantages of being close enough to 
New York to retain their season 
ticket holders, and of being large 
enough-70,000 seats-to hold 
them all. Interstate 95 and the 
Merritt Parkway both pass within 
miles of the Bowl, and adequate 
parking space was available in lots 
and on Yale sports fields surrounding the site. 

Added to these physical advantages, the Bowl had hosted professional football games annually 
since 1960, when the Giants began
