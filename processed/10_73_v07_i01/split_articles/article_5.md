playing the pre-season Albie Booth 
games, and later the Jets--Giants 
"Suburban Bowl., 
The access roads were not de-
signed to handle the traffic a 
Giants' game would create, however, 
and there were other disad-
vantages as well. The grass play-
ing field would require extensive 
and hurried repairs after a Sat-
urday Yale home game. The half-
time rooms in the Bowl and 
Lapham Fieldhouse were inad-
equate even by college football 
standards. (Sam Chauncey once 
commented that they are "the 
worst facilities in the Ivy League ... ) 
The press box is tiny and primitive. 
To the Giants•s eye, however, the 
advantages of a stadium large 
enough and close enough stood 
out most sharply. The details 
either could be improved or tol-
erated. 

Almost as soon as people knew 
that the Giant's would be leaving 
Yankee Stadium for New Jersey, 
speculation about whether they 
would play in New Haven began. 
New Haven Journal-Courier Sports 
Editor Bill Guthrie claimed that 
the Giants had contacted Yale 
in the fall of 1972, although Mara 
denied that any contacts had been 
made with anyone. The first 
official word Yale heard from the 
Giants came in February, 1973, 
when Giants' attorney and Yale 
alumnus Lawrence Krieger 
phoned University Secretary Sam 
Chauncey to ask about use of 
the Bowl for the five 1973 home 
games. Chauncey told Krieger he 
would raise the question with the 
Yale Corporation and call him back 
When the Corporation approved 
the playiug of the annual Albie 
Booth charity game at the Yale 
Bowl in 1960, it stipulated that 
no other professional sporting 
events would be allowed. At 
that time, University President 
A. Whitney Griswold was appar-
ently worried that professionalism 
might taint Yale's own athletic 
program by introducing some of 
its seedier elements such as 
gambling. 

With a steadily deteriorating 
fmancial situation on their hands, 
GUIOA 
.~.-
the Corporation apparently over-
ruled this policy in favor of 
seeking a lucrative settlement with 
the Giants. They instructed 
Chauncey to begin negotiating a 
contract. 

It appeared that an agreement 
with the Giants could greatly 
benefit the University. The Giant's 
arrival would help soothe the bad 
feelings between Yale and New 
Haven caused last year by the 
handling of the proposed new 
colleges. The deal would be a boost 
to local business and would please 
New Haven area fans as well. As for 
Yale, rental of the Bowl would 
help alleviate the financial crisis. 
C:trmen Cozza suggested that pro-
fessional games might also have a 
positive effect on Yale football by 
providing examples of high-caliber 
play. 

The Yale administration was 
well aware that the Giants could 
not easily afford to lose the Yale 
Bowl, and thus knew it could 
safely use the negotiations to help 
improve its relations with New 
Haven. Hence, when the Corpora-
tion meeting of March 10 pro-
duced an affirmative answer to 
the Giants, they worded the 
announcement carefully: "The 
Corporation views with favor the 
leasing of the Bowl for this pur-
pose provided the city of New Hav 
Haven and the city of West Haven 
want this to happen ... The Cor-
poration's deference to New Hav 
Haven's interests contrasted sharply 
with the arrogant attitude they 
had displayed dunng the contro-
versy over the two new residen-
tial colleges. It appeared to rep-
resent a carefully displayed pos-
ture toward the surrounding city, 
a new conciliatory style of nego-
tiation. 

Nevertheless, Chauncey insisted 
on more than a mere change of 
style. He demanded that Hartford-
based television station WTIC 
be allowed to broadcast the Giants 
games locaUy. He was worried 
about the 500,000 people in the 
station's viewing area, who "for 
five years have gotten to see nearly 
every Giants game on TV. Yale did 
not wish and could not afford to

alienate these people solely be-
cause of a pursuit of the almighty 
dollar." Nor did Chauncey agree 
with the principle of blacking 
out Hartford and New Haven, es-
pecially since tickets to the Giants 
games would not be readily 
available. 

NFL Broadcast Co-ordinator 
Robert Cochran called Chauncey's 
stipulation "u~reasonable." He 
noted that since the broadcast re-
quest would violate NFL guide-
lines, it would have to be discussed 
at the league meeting in Scottsdale, 
Ariz. on April 25. After the meet-
ing, the league announced that the 
five Giants opponents had ap-
proved the WTIC broadcasts pro-
vided the contest was sold out 
six days in advance. (This pro-
vision was superseded by recent 
Congressional action which allows 
broadcasts of games sold out 
three days in advance.) 

Yale established a one-year 
contract with the Giants with an 
option to renew for two addition-
al years. The contract reflected 
caution on both sides of the 
table: Yale wanted to be able to 
evict the Giants if their games 
proved detrimental to Yale foot-
ball or University-city relations; 
the Giants had not ruled out the 
possibility that they might return 
to Yankee Stadium under the 
new Mayor. The contract called 
for payment of about $1 million 
for two years, or about $85,000 
per game. The Giants agreed to 
renovate Lapham Fieldhouse and 
half-time rooms at the Bowl, and 
to pay all costs involved in prepar-
ing and cleani!"g the Bowl on the 
day of their games. 

When the Yale Corporation 
approved the use of the Bowl on 
condition that New Haven and 
West Haven wanted the Giants, 
it tossed the issue into the laps of 
the politicians. Mayor Guida had 
already expressed his personal 
approval of the idea, but reserved 
official judgment until the city 
and the Giants could get together. 
New Haven stood to profit con-
siderably from the arrangement, 
both in monetary and less tangible 
Volume seven, number one I October 7, 19731 8 
terms. New York fans could be 
expected to come to New Haven 
and pump money into the City's 
motels and restaurants. Realizing 
the economic boost the Giants 
could bring, a group of downtown 
business and community leaders 
urged Guida to approve the plan. 
Not only would local businesses 
reap profits, but the city itself 
stood to profit from parking·, pro-
gram and concession percentages. 
The city began to negotiate with 
the Giants before Guida had given 
his official blessing, apparently with 
the idea that reaching an accept-
able concessions agreement would 
be the condition for the city's 
permission. The Giants were not 
inclined to argue. Still, the con-
cessions negotiations dragged for 
months, and became known in 
New York City as "the hot dog 
war." Guida drove a hard bargain. 
On May 24 they finally reached 
agreement and New Haven extended 
the official hand to the New York 
Giants. 

·The concessions agreement re-
portedly gave 85 percent of the 
profits to New Haven, 15 percent 
to West Haven and nothing to 
the Giants; but they hadn't re-
ceived any concessions profits 
in Yankee Stadium, either. The 
city also picked up the prestige 
of being a major league football 
town, if only temporarily. But 
the Giants would bring problems 
as well as profits. Funds would 
be needed for police, traffic 
control, maintenance and clean-up 
personnel, and the two cities 
required the Giants to pay them. 

There were nagging zoning 
problems: the Westville area which 
contains the Bowl is zoned resi-
dential, and at one point, City 
Building Inspector Orlando Sil-
vestri contended that "the use 
of the Bowl by the Giants or any 
other professional team would be 
a business use not allowed in a 
residential zone." 

Last April, Silvestri asked City 
Corporation Counsel Thomas 
Keyes to prepare an advisory 
opinion on the subject. While 
Keyes publicly expressed his dis-
agreement with Silvestri's inter-
Giants 'home' 
schedule: 
October 7 
October 14 
Green Bay Packers 
Washington Redskins 
No~mber 11 Dallas Cowboys 
No~mber 18 St. Louis Cardinals 
December 16 Minnesota Vikings 
Yale Bowl,

pretation of the zoning ordinance, 
he set to work. Two months later 
he was still working on it, and the 
final agreement was announced 
in spite of the unresolved zoning 
question. Guida declared at the 
May 24 announcement ceremony 
that "I don't feel there is any 
zoning trouble or anything else 
that would bar us from welcom-
ing the Giants." The Giants de-
clared that Yale, as landlord, 
should settle the zoning situation. 
Chauncey flatly stated that Yale 
would not involve itself in a 
zoning dispute. Silvestri's office 
stated that circumstances had 
not changed. Finally, on July 17, 
Keyes produced his opinion: 
the Yale Bowl existed in West-
ville before the zoning ordinance 
was passed, and therefore qualifies 
as a "non-conforming" use of 
property. Keyes asserted that 
since admission had been charged 
and large crowds assembled since 
the Bowl was constructed, the 
Giants games would simply be 
an extension of this "non-conform-
ing" use. 

Ahh, politics. 

The Giants, then, finally have 
found a place to play their 1973 
home season. Their search was 
arduous, their agreement costly, 
their site distant. But they avoided 
Tampa and the grind of playing 
14 away games. They didn't 
alienate their season ticket holders 
nor invoke the wrath of the league. 
They were finally satisfied. 

New Haven has gained status. 
It will receive direct payments 
from parking and concessions, and

indirect revenue from the influx of 
Giant fans ... It should be," as Old 
Heidelberg owner Buddy Cavallero 
observed, .. a shot in the arm for 
down town New Haven business." 
The team will enhance civic pride 
and improve New Haven's self-
image. And as one downtown 
businessman noted, "They'll 
liven up the place." 

If the Giants stay for two seasons, 
Yale will earn roughly $1 million 
in rent. More importantly, Yale 
has partially restored its damaged 
relations with New Haven. The 
University regained at least the 
spirit of the Mellon Center agree-
ment. 

. 
What relation will the University 
and the team have in the future? 
Secretary Chauncey has stated 
"Three years is the limit," but 
what will happen if, (as is likely) 
the East Rutherford stadium re-
mains unconstructed by 197 6? 
Will Yale again come to the Giants' 
rescue? Chauncey emphasized 
that Yale asked for only a fixed 
annual rent, because "we're running 
running a non-profit institution. 
We're not in the speculation bus-
iness." Realizing that the Giants 
must either return to New Haven, 
prostrate themselves before the 
New York City Mayor, or play 
only road games, the University 
may press the Giants for more 
handsome compensation. Indeed, 
the University's three-year limit 
may only be a bargaining ploy, 
promising tougher negotiations 
in the future. 

All this is predicated on improved 
relations between Yale and New 
Haven. The Giants provided Yale 
with a splendid opportunity to 
bridge the chasm to the city. As 
such, the political benefits of 
attracting the Giants were at 
least as valuable as the economic 
benefits. Yale needed to prove 
its concern for New Haven's needs 
and wants. 

The University's new attitude 
appears to stem from New Haven's 
rejection of the colleges; yet it 
does not appear to be motivated 
simply be a desire to reverse that 
decision. 

The Giant decision was not an 
adequate test of Yale's motives 
precisely because it was such a 
beneficial arrangement for all 
concerned. Yale's short-term in-
terests coincided with its long-
term interests: the immediate 
political impljcations of the alder-
men's decision were so obvious 
that only sheer blindness or 
stubborn arrogance would have 
allowed Yale to overlook New 
Haven's interest in the Giants' 
prospective move to the Bowl. 

What did Yale learn from 
the colleges fiasco? If it learned 
only the necessity of present 
appeasement, the Giants' deal 
was simply a well-disguised bribe 
If the University learned how to 
cooperate with the city, then 
the Giants' deal was a sound in-
vestment in Yale's future. 0
