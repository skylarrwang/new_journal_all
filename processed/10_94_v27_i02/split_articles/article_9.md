**Page number(s): 5-6**

When you go to rhe Ninth Square 
Farmers' Marker, between Chapel and Elm, 
you can find Frank and the market's other 
merchants. Frank will help you pull rhe 
husks off rhe corn until you find good, 
yellow cobs. They're four for a dollar. Frank. 
might also remark rhat you have come to 
the only place in town for fresh vegetables 
(picked yesterday). 

Frank works with Jim, but not for him. 
Jim Clouse ("jimmy" to Frank) runs rhe 
Ninth 
Square 
Farmers' Market, 
which is ser up 
on 
Saturdays 
from 9 to I and 
Wednesdays 9 ro 
3. Frank lends a 
hand at Jim's 
booth, and he 
knows 
their 
pr oducts. 
They've 
got 
jalapenos, bell 
peppers, plum 
tomatoes, full-
size romaroes, enormous tomatoes, bumpy 
cucumbers, Russet potatoes, corn in the 
husk, very green string beans, and, Frank 
loves to point our, three varieties of apples: 
Macintosh, Golden, and Granny. They do 
not, however, have onions. 

Mary Ann from North Haven doesn't 
either; neither does George, from 
Wallingford, or Fred who, with his son 
Patrick, keeps a farm our in Northford. But 
they will all let you test their corn. If you 
hope ro bargain-hunt, you will find rhe 
same at Mary Ann's and Fred's: both sell a 
pound of string beans (which appear to 
have absolutely the same quality) for a 
dollar. 

You will be happy to know that Mary 
Ann has mushrooms, big and tasty; you 
can spot her easily because she calls our: 
"Here's the biggest bargain in town." If 
you're a student, you'll get a special 
discount; tuition is too much, she says. Go 
to Fred and Patrick, who are set up at the 
opposite end from Frank and Jim, for 
eggplant. They rend to run our of apples 
(they did today), so stick wirh Frank for 
those. Besides Mary Ann's mushrooms and 
Fred's eggplant, the four booths have much 
the same selection. Bur Frank might point 
out, you don't have to leave rown to ger 
'em fresh. 

George, rhe young man at rhe third 
booth, wears a Connecticut Farm Fresh T-
shirt, and he will, for sure, point our that 
everything ar rhe marker is grown in-srare. 
George grows all 
rhe produce for 
his booth, but 
buys the fruit 
from 
another 
~ Connecticut 
~ farmer. If you 
~ complain about 
g the 
lack 
of 
bananas 
or 
oranges, George 
will laugh and 
point to his shirt: 
"Only Connect-
icut-grown 
Products Sold Here."

Don't worry about hawking vendors. 
Only Mary Ann shouts out her bargain 
prices. Besides her, everyone keeps quiet; 
they wait for customers' questions. Frank, 
though, talks more than Jim, who stands in 
the shade behind rhe table. Frank runs 
around the stand, refilling baskets, 
weighing beans and tomatoes, and fixing 
the signs which say: "Connecticut Grown 
... $1 I lb." 

Frank does get tired of saying, "They're 
four for a dollar," but he loves to talk about 
growing up on the farm. When he finds a 
second to rest, he'll tell you about North 
Carolina. 
"In North Carolina, my father never 
grew apples." 
And about New Haven: "I've lived in 
this city for thirty years now; I nud to 
work with produce." 

Frank might show you his bee sting, 
which happened last Saturday. Ir hasn't 
healed. "I guess rhe stinger is still inside. 
Still hurts like a banshee." He pinches the 
pink sore. Luckily, he's not allergic, "''d 
have died a long time ago if chat were the 
case. I grew up on a farm." 

Jim really wanes you co buy tomatoes. 
''Try one of these." He might give you a 
plum tomato. "Our own brand." He will 
explain, if you ask, chat he coo grows his 
own vegetables but buys the fruit. 

If you're more curious, and ask Jim the 
right questions, he will teU you why he 
runs the market in the center of New 
Haven. He'll point toward his flier: 
Connecticut Farm Fresh, FARMERS' MARKET 
WIC. "There's the story, right there: 
Women, Infants, Children, WIC. We do 
coupons." You bite into the tomato. "I 
depend on a cliencele, buc we do chis ·here 
because of chis nutrition program. Business 
has been slow. There was a problem with 
the coupons; 1 think they must have cut 
back on the allocations." Jim talks more 
when you get him on the subject of 
business. "That's why we have the market 
here in town." 

Even though you understand that Jim 
runs the market for city residents on 
welfare, you admit to him that the location 
is strange. There are few apartments or 
houses in the area, the booths are crammed 
together between two buildings, and the 
vegetables are the only green things in 
sight. But none of that matters to Jim. He 
will explain to you-and Frank might join 
in-that this is the only place in town co 
get fresh produce (picked yesterday).
