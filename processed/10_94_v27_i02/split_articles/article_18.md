students to bookstores despite of their distance from Yale. Golden 
Thread Booksellers, a feminist bookstore on State Street, orders 
course books for three classes in the women's studies department. 
Owner Alison Cunningham has sold women's literature for over a 
dozen years, and some professors in the department have patronized 
her business for the last decade. Cunningham sees her business as a 
real-life complement to the academia of women's studies. "I think it's 
only obvious that women's studies would want to do business with a 
feminist bookstore. This is a real-world example of many of the ideas 
rhey're ~ing exposed to in the classroom." 

Students in Professor Melvin Ely's history classes have hiked a 
shorter distance for the past three years to the Blackprint Heritage 
Gallery, a self-titled "Educational Resource Center" on Edgewood. 
Owner Bea Dozier-Taylor feels passionately about the opportunities 
for Yale students in her bookstore and art gallery. "It would be 
wonderful if other professors would recognize that to talk about 
African-American history in the classroom, students can benefit from 
walking into what they're studying." Student effort first brought 
Professor Ely to the bookstore. Dozier-Taylor says that professors 
expressed concern about the neighborhood when students first 
mentioned the black-owned bookstore. This attitude offended 
Students who, like Dozier-Taylor, feel her store is nestled in a safe and 
strong community. Indeed, it's hard to imagine Yale students so 
uncomfortable with New Haven that they would fear the walk up 
Edgewood to Blackprint, just four blocks from Davenport College.

n the spirit of the age of mechanical reproduction, more and more 
professors opt to supplement the books on their syllabi with 
course packets. This addition aspires to goals both lofty and 
obvious. The professor tries to save students' money by using copied 
information from a book rather than the whole book, exposing 
Students to a dense anthology of theses alternative to those espoused 
in the course books, and impressing students by suggesting that the 
informacion needed to understand their lectures is too cutting-edge 
to have yet been published. 

The use of course packets, however, raises issues far more complex
