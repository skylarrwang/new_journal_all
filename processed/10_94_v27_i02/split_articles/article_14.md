Holquist maintains that the atmosphere 
at Yale no longer attacks deconstruction. "I 
think we soon outgrew that," he says. "Yale 
is where deconstruction happened first, and 
there is a sense in which we have 
accommodated it in one way or another. I 
think we negotiated the transition before 
other places did, and if I may say so, with 
more maturity." 


While Fry points to Yale's "quite 
concerted and conscious hostility towards 
deconstruction over the last ten years," he 
insists that Yale has not extended this 
prejudice to leftist politics. The intellectual 
left cannot be directly equated with rhe 
politi{;al left; any hostility that may remain 
at Yale towards deconstruction is purely 
theoretically based. "There was really no 
question in anyone's mind of a political 
purge," explains Fry. "That never happened 
at Yale, and it's certainly not happening 
now." 


Humanities Professor Harold Bloom 
also separates theoretical and political 
concerns. He warns against the unification 
of literature and politics, despite the fact 
that literature itself necessarily contains a 
political element. "''m saying that the study 
of literature should primarily be an aesthetic 
and cognitive affair. It should not be a 
political affair. Literature can be anything it 
wants to be, and it always does have a 
political aspect. But the study of ir is a 
different matter." 


Currently, no single theoretical school 
appears to dominate the study of 
literature at Yale. "There is no 
IDEAS 
paradigm of study that is generally 
conceded to be natural now," explains 
Holquisr. "A lor of people deplore it. They. 
call it a crisis. They think it's something 
new. It isn't new. It may be a crisis, but it's 
nor necessarily a bad thing. It's a very 
excmng nme." 


Bloom, though, abhors current trends 
in the srudy of literature. He uses the term 
"the school of resentment" to lump rogether 
recent developments in literary study, 
including new h istoricism, academic 
feminism, and cultural criticism, which he 
describes as "neither cultural nor criticism 
so far as I can tell, but just silly politics." 


Bloom maintains that cultural criticism 
"totally dominates universities and colleges. 
I don't think literature is taught any more 
for the most part. I mean, there are a few 
places like Yale where literature is still 
taught, bur whether that will survive even ar 
Yale I don't know. I'm very gloomy." 


Bloom claims ro eschew all schools of 
literary thought. "I am your true Marxist, 
following Groucho rather than Karl. I rake 
as my motto Groucho's grand motto, which 
was 'Whatever it is, I'm agai nst it.' One 
should learn ro read for oneself and ro think 
for oneself. That's what Emerson was all 
about and I thought being an American was 
all about." 


Although Holquisr does not believe char 
the study of literatu re at Yale can be 
characterized by a single critical movement, 
he does assert, "Some of the more exciting 
stuff char's being done right now is coming 
our of cerrain kinds of feminist criticism, 
certain kinds of pose-colonial criticism, 
cultural studies in general." 


Cultural criticism is 
often described as either an 
expansion of the theory of 
deconstruction or a reaction 
against ir. "Cultural criticism 
can be seen as a kind of gross 
reaction ro rhe misreading of 
deconstruction 
as 
rhe 
overemphasis 
on sheer 
rexrualiry. It's as if they are 
overcompensating," explains 
Holquist. 


During his 13 years at Yale, Paul de 
Man perfected the role of the influen-
tial literary critic. Until his death in 
1983, he was the high priest of the arcane
