**Customer Is Still Always Right-As Long As He Or She Wants To Be.**
**Author: Joel Burges**
**Page number(s): 31**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I turn the corner and I'm in the hot foods section, known as "Mrs. Leonard's Kitchen." The image of a woman in the kitchen has, predictably, been co-opted by capitalism's number-one grocer. While Stew runs the family business from his jail cell, Mrs. Leonard's glowing portrait honors the domestic dream of American womanhood. 

The dream is over. I trudge toward the check-out counter, having bought next to nothing-only a bottle of apple cider. 

As I walk away from the cash registers, autographed glossies of Billy Ray Cyrus and Dolly Parton sport their down-home smiles to draw me back. I can even see 90210 heart-throb/dork Ian Zie.ring out of the corner of my eye. Not only do star photos pepper the wall, but a little further towards the exit Stew displays pictures of custom'ers with Stew Leonard's paraphernalia. The photos have been taken all over the world, from Singapore to Sing Sing. I meant to bring a Stew Leonard's bag with me to England last summer, but forgot, and so I will instead have to wait to achieve celebrity status on the walls of Stew Leonard's.
