in the dining hall." Members welcome the 
opportunity to spurn rhe frivolous for the 
philosophical. Amy Ng (CC '96) asked, 
"How often do you sit at the Daily Caffe 
and talk about Roman Sculpture? People 
don't think you're pretentious when you do 
that at .the club." Erudition is both 
expected and accepted. 

Lured by edible and intellectual 
indulgences, professors and students shed 
their hierarchical roles. Undergraduates say 
rhe access to faculty surpasses regular 
campus resources. A professor, helping 
herself to 
a 
sandwich, )Otns 
an 
undergraduate discussion to assert that, yes, 
there are professions so stimulating rhar 
people want to work while on vacation, 
and rhat she, herself, enjoys writing articles 
during summer break. Reclining on a 
couch, a professor emeritus calls into the 
next room ro ask a student how his singing 
is going. They make a date for rea next 
week. 

Rr
larively unknown to outsiders, rhe 
Club and irs genteel inclinations 
nvite misinterpretation. As one 
student said, "I guess it's a very exclusive 
club for English majors and professors." 
Campus myth has it that the Lizzie houses 
everything from a cafe, ro a secret society, 
to a band of retrograde Anglophiles. Like 
most myths, these mix the largely false with 
rhe partly true. Co:urary to rumor, 
McDermott says, "it's not made up of a 
majority of English majors doing 
Shakespeare for their senior thesis." 
Members talk about the Club's "diversity" 
with a meaning peculiar to the Lizzie. 
Inrellecrual diversity would be more 
precise. The Club embraces those 
proficient at what Ng calls "stimulating 
conversation," including a few electrical 
engineers, a smattering of social scientists, 
and a number of economists. According to 
Professor Beatrice Barden (GRD '80), 
admissions committee chairman and Club 
vice-presidenr, being generally interested is 
more important than having a particular 
interest. 

Members display a certain degree of 
homogeneity, although, according ro 
22 
alumni activist Henry James, Jr. (JE '40) 
"there is no obvious type." More apparent 
are those who are obviously not the rype. 
While the club is nor secret, it is selective. 
Mansharamani has "no qualms about 
saying that some people are right for it, 
some people aren't. Some people in the 
university community would be alienated 
by its elements of long-standing tradition." 
While not mandated, the members' 
manners favor imported gentility over all-
American audacity. Rebels and radicals will 
likely no more enjoy the club than suit it. 
Indeed, nobody speaks belligerently, nor 
does anyone dangle his or her participles. 
Undergraduate apparel consists of Ralph 
Lauren and the Gap, with a touch of 
Brooks Brothers or Laura Ashley. The 
members range from clean-cut to gleaming. 
Yet the admissions committee bases irs 
decisions solely on paper credentials. 
Members quickly point out that there are 
no steadfast requirements for selection. 
Beyond Yale affiliation, the constitution 
does nor specify any criteria. Admissions 
are therefore a simple process. The 
committee selects approximately fifty new 
members a year based upon 
rwo 
recommendations submitted by existing 
members. Each class has a quota: ten 
sophomores, fifteen juniors and forty-five 
seniors. At the end of the year, the 
committee selects four freshmen as "seeds" 
to starr off membership for their class. 
Faculty and graduate students undergo 
more rigorous scrutiny )o evaluate exactly 
how involved they'll be in the club," says 
Ng, a member of last year's committee. 
Nominees 
undergo 
no 
arduous 
applications, no swear-inducing inrerviews, 
no painful rejection letters-only an 
"indefinite hold" if a candidate's letters lack 
what Ng calls a "sense of the person," or 
appear ro be "written under coercion." A 
surprisingly high proportion of members 
receive acceptance lerrers, not even aware 
that they had been recommended. Bartlett 
says, "It isn't a nasry process." 

Admission was both more stringent and 
consequential in James' day. Akin to secret

societies, rhe Lizzie chose those who "made 
their mark on campus." A Yale Daily News 
columnist and the Yale Literary Magazine 
edi ror, James claims he was the "least 
qualified" among the published poets and 
acclaimed genluses admirred in 1937. 
Admission often determined rhe success of 
a college career at a rime when exclusive 
societies had a social power bordering on 
hegemon ic. Membership awarded such 
distinction rhar James would seal letters 
with the Club's official insignia ro impress 
romantic 
interests. · Cole

ames has no illusions about the Club's 
current prominence on campus. The 
Lizzie stood fast to its traditions while 
e university grew around it. With the 
Yale student body engaged in a greater 
array of activities, the Club no longer 
serves as a focal point of campus prestige. 
Members themselves describe it as a nice 
"peripheral" and "complement" to the rest 
of their Yale experience. Without a social 
or extracurricular center, the diverse subsets 
of today's campus have outgrown a singular 
standard of success. A stellar thespian may 
not realize that she shares a bathroom with 
a PU party president; no longer does any 
one particular sect command respect. As a 
result, dubs like the Lizzie no longer reign 
supreme. 

Nevertheless, the Club remains a mark 
of merit in its own circles, inducing what 
James calls "fierce loyalty." Active members 
go to tea three or four times a week. They 
reserve a line for th e Lizzie on their 
resumes. T hey speak of the Club with 
fervent tones of admiration and wax idyllic 
on its singularity. Rather than regard its 
out-of- the mainstream stand ing as a 
detriment, the Lizzie relishes archaism. It

takes pride in idiosyncrasy, in deviation 
from the modern. Rules and routines have 
been decreed by precedence. Lopes turns 
away guests at 6: IS sharp. Members 
complain if a New Haven guest visits more 
frequently than the once a week limit. 
Reverence for tradition borders on rhe 
comic. Charles DiArcino (LAW '95) a 
third year law student, tells a story about a 
day last year when he placed a book on the 
fireplace mantle. There it remains, resting 
at the same angle, where other members 
assumed it had historical significance. 

Therein lies the Club's peculiar 
attraction. Although other activities 
provide free food, good talk, and literary 
stimulation, members describe the Lizzie's 
hold, a sense of devotion and affection not 
inspired 
by 
their 
other 
campus 
extracurriculars. What members ger, aside 
from physical and intellectual amenities, is 
a dim memory of "club." Irs rituals and 
rhetoric harken to a bygone era when 
membership provided what James calls "a 
tangible reward for what you do and who 
you are." On a campus increasingly 
fragmented and minimally hierarchical, 
such formal and explicit recognition 
becomes a unique privilege. Admission is 
an endorsement, a rare gift at a university 
dominated by overachievers. Tradition 
bestows prestige and exclusivity bestows 
distinction. 

And so the Club clings with the 
utmost tenacity to what Parks calls its 
"whimsical gentility." Inside, time halts; 
even the grandfather clock has stopped. 
The topics of conversation-Hamlet's fatal 
indecision, lago's green eyed monster-will 
be as fresh in fifty years. While members 
indulge in culinary dainties, bibliophilic 
treasures, and "civilized" company, they 
enjoy the privilege of membership. The 
Lizzie has rescued these luxuries from a 
postmodern mentality. When the vault 
opens next week, the Elizabethan Club will 
surely be the same. As it will the next, and 
the next.
