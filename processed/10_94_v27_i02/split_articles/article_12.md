Do heritage and apizza a true Italian neighborhood make, or is it time for Wooster Square to say goodbye?  This hour that will round Wooster Square will attract more attention than the green itself: which is really nothing more than another pretty, tree-lined park. Exceptionally fine examples of nineteenth-century American architecture, the houses have "evolved in harmonious fashion," as the commemorative plaque tells you. Each house has a distinct personality that might assert itself in an intricate balcony grillwork, on a silent rustic facade, or in the huge blue morning glories hanging over the edge of a flower box.


The Square's most compelling characteristic is its statue. Standing on a pedestal in the south end, Cristoforo Colombo asserts the monumental heroism of the day before political correctness took his name down the road of revisionist history. After all, he took his place there in 1892, at the height of Italian pride and presence in New Haven. Paul Russo, (1891) the first Italian student at Yale, unveiled the statue among the cherry blossoms at the first New Haven Columbus Day Festival.


For 102 years, Columbus has stood among the trees looking toward the community that put him there, watching the evolution of the neighborhood. While the park's official name is Wooster Square, after the Revolutionary War hero General David Wooster (1717), people around here call it Columbus Green. That gesture of naming reveals the sense of ownership that Italian-American residents assert over this neighborhood.


Like Columbus' image, though, New Haven's Little Italy has changed in the past century.  Clearly it is comprised of a few restaurants and stores on a few blocks. But Wooster Square still feels like an Italian neighborhood. Walk down Wooster Street on a nice Saturday morning, and you will see folks like Joe "Duck" Scarpellino sitting with friends Mel and Ralph on plastic folding chairs. Clad in comfortable T-shirts, shorts, and dark glasses, they are talking, watching the street, and sipping wine. Most of them do not live in Wooster Square anymore. They moved out years ago to Fair Haven or East Shore. But they come back every weekend, to regroup, to maintain contact with those who did stay, like Joe. Even a few minutes, Joe gives a wave of recognition to a passing car. After all, it's his neighborhood. Four generations of the Scarpellino family live in the same building: Joe, Joe "Duck" Jr., Joe III, and Joe III's son.


A week-night at Tony and Lucille's means Italian opera music, flowered tables, and Tony himself, a balding man in a black and purple striped shirt that does nothing for his potbelly. Tony Sacco's calzones are fried, stuffed with cheese, and smothered in rich red sauce.


The whole stretch of Wooster Street proves gastronomically delightful. People line up a full hour before Sally's and Pepe's open and often endure bad service, all for the glory of true Italian apizza. "You don't have to use binoculars to see the toppings," boasts Sal Monragno, who has worked there for 55 years. You don't need binoculars to watch the process either. Behind Sal's counter, Gary, a grandson of the original owner Frank Pepe, ladles red sauce onto the flour, tosses cheese on top. Workers busily slide the pizzas in and out of the brick oven with paddle-like wooden utensils that have handles at least five feet long.


Down the street at Cavaliere's grocery store, Silvio and Emidio Cavaliere greet customers by name—some by neighborhood nicknames ranging from Drink a Beer Novella to Matches Arnica to Pat My Nerves Esposiro. "It's like a newsstand, everyone goes there to gossip," says Alderwoman Louise DeLauro (D-8). "Is someone hurt? Did someone die? Did someone have a baby? You go to Cavaliere's." Angelo, grandson and namesake of founder Angelo Cavaliere, tells a tall, dark woman with a little girl, "You're looking good. That vacation did you good," while ringing up her purchase. In the back, a poster promotes Amalfi, the city from which many of the Italian families in the area hail. Behind the counter, old photos plaster the wall: Silvio and Emidio in service uniform, a huge length of cheese in the early days of the store.


Silvio and Emidio are short, round men, with remarkably round eyes, round balding heads, and identical round bellies. Their father, Angelo, started the store in 1934, when it was one of many grocery stores and specialty markets that littered the neighborhood. Only Cavaliere's remains from that golden era.


"In those days, there were no set hours. They worked for 12 or 15 hours a day. They worked hard," reminisces Emidio. Most of the Italians who came with the mass immigration wave of the late nineteenth century hailed from southern Italy. Driven by poverty and visions of "a land of gold," they found work building the railroads and manning the factories. Wooster Square quickly became the Italian center of New Haven because of its proximity to factories like Sargents, the hardware manufacturer.


The Italians who emigrated during this time were "mostly illiterate in their own language and in English," says Ralph, a former resident and crony of Joe "Duck." They walked to their jobs at the factories or set up their own businesses.


But the new immigrants faced discrimination. Much of the strife involved the Irish community. Emidio Cavaliere remembers how Italians used to have to sit in the back of services at St. Patrick's church. Ralph places this discrimination in the natural progression of the immigration process. "The blacks today are what the Italians used to be 25 years ago," he says. "First it was the English stepping on the Irish, then the Irish on the Italians, now it's the blacks' turn."


This matter-of-fact tone belies a certain resentment toward minority communities today. Italians on the whole had to give up their language and heritage as they became Americanized—on the surface, at least. "[Our parents) were not like the Hispanics," Ralph says, "who just stay in their own community and put up signs in their own language."


Old stereotypes about Italians, particularly those growing out of popular cinema, persist on the streets of New Haven. You couldn't run a business here if you didn't speak Italian. "When people think of Italians, they think of two things: pizza and the mafia," Ralph says. "People would look at us like we were some kind of freaks, like we were all gangsters or part of the mob. Like our sisters were driving the getaway cars from the bank."


Stories abound about members of the mafia who used to come into restaurants in Little Italy and "throw money around." "They had these names like Blackie or Whitey," recalls one former resident. "One of them, Fat Fanny, would come in and we'd be scrambling around moving chairs and tables out of the way, because he weighed 600 pounds. Now you don't see them anymore, probably because they've all been bumped off."


The stereotype lingers today. A librarian at the New Haven Public Library warns that some people might get the wrong idea if you ask too many questions about the community. It is pretty well known, he says, that some members of that community are part of the Family, that this is Gambino country.


Scarpellino unknowingly contributes to this image by asserting that Little Italy ranks as one of the better neighborhoods in New Haven. "The crime rate is low here," he says, "because everyone knows one another. If there's a problem, it gets taken care of. We kind of have our own police force."


Defying discrimination does not preclude holding on to heritage. Almost every fact that New Haven's Italian-American residents cite matches Roland Osterweis' *Thru Centuries of New Haven*, even down to the year in which St. Michael's, the dominant church in the area, was established. Their ties to Italy remain strong. Sacco, of Tony and Lucille's, remembers his parents going to Italy 25 different times.


But weekend visits alone cannot revive the atmosphere of the once-thriving neighborhood. In the early years, "it was very ethnic. You couldn't run a business here if you didn't speak Italian," Emidio recalls. "There was a time when you couldn't sell American bread. It was strictly Italian. Now that's all gone."


"What you're seeing is only a little part of what it used to be," says Sacco, who was born on Wooster Street. "The highway cut it in half. Every parking lot, every open space you see used to be a building."


The elimination of low-rent housing, as well as the demolition of houses to make way for the new interstate highway, led to a massive Italian exodus. "The highway raped my neighborhood," DeLauro declares. "It was devastating to my people. Before, everything that you needed was in the neighborhood. It was like Italy—all you had to do was walk a little ways and you could go to the grocery store, to the fish market, to the drugstore.


"Some people say it was deliberate," DeLauro says. The then heavily Republican district was a sore point for the Democratic mayor of a largely Democratic city. Dispersing the Italians would scatter Republican votes. Ironically, the Italian community today has switched its loyalty to the Democratic party.


Large-scale relocation sparked intense reaction. Those beyond Franklin Street were reimbursed for their homes and many moved to East Shore. "There were people who cried because they didn't want to leave Wooster Square," says DeLauro. "They were so heart-broken, so sad." The money the government gave to the families "was not enough for someone brought up in a neighborhood to pick up and go to another." Nor could the neighborhood be replicated in the suburbs of East Shore.


Displacement led to Little Italy's decline. The number of fish markets, meat markets, grocery stores, and drugstores dwindled; only the hardiest and oldest of businesses endured. The second generation won't run the stores, but the first didn't have sufficient education to do anything else, says Emidio Cavaliere. "The third generation is the doctors and congressmen." DeLauro's Congresswoman daughter Rosa (D-CT) is a case in point.


But a few members of Little Italy's third generation have pursued a different path. "It's the commercial aspect that keeps the Italian element here," says Joe "Duck" Scarpellino. And it is perhaps in these businesses—these family-run businesses—that the future of Wooster Street lies.


Laura and Trisha Consiglio are the third generation to run Consiglio's restaurant, founded by their grandfather in 1938. Formerly known as the Big Apple, Consiglio's is the fourth oldest business on Wooster Street. A year ago, Laura Consiglio, a tawny-haired woman with a perpetual easy smile, left her position at the Yale Alumni Magazine for a role in the family establishment. Since then, she has tried to organize a neighborhood business association, the first of its kind in the community.


"I wanted the businesses here to work together to beautify and promote the area as a tourist attraction," explains Consiglio. "There are certain things we can do as a group to make this a viable area. People don't know about us. There are no signs on the highways or anything, and we're a real attraction of the city. I think that culturally, there's a tradition here that people can enjoy."


Although all neighborhood businesses came to a meeting at Consiglio's last spring, they accomplished nothing concrete, partly because in the old days, associations "were not the way you did things," Consiglio explains. These days, however, family spirit and pride may not suffice to keep Wooster Street alive. As the sons and daughters of immigrants age, the next generation returns equipped with books and business courses. Still, the same spirit that motivated their ancestors keeps these younger generations coming back. "Working with your family has its drawbacks," Consiglio says. "They might make you madder than if you were working with strangers, but there's always a strong pull. It's in my blood, I guess."


Cristoforo Colombo stands tall and imposing on the south side of Wooster Square, holding a globe in his left hand and looking out from the trees. A hundred years ago, in 1892, he looked out upon a healthy neighborhood rich in history and just beginning to assert itself in America. His gaze encompassed the far-reaching ambitions of a proud community. In 1994, he gazes beyond the present, into the uncertain future of Little Italy, perhaps into the future of all ethnic neighborhoods. Unable to read his iron countenance, those who wander along Wooster Square can only wonder what he thinks of the changing community.
