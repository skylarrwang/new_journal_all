Fables of the 
N
o professor wanrs to talk 
about it. A few will, off the record. Others will publicly, 
though slightly hesitantly, if only to lay the issue to rest 
at last. Some offer no more than definitions and 
historical facts. Everyone seems guarded; this reticence itself is 
sometimes concealed. What is this illicit scandal in the English 
department? Embezzlement? Incest? No. It's a literary theory, 
perhaps the most controversial of the twentieth century-a theory 
that one professor called "destruction" by mistake. This theory, 
deconstrucdon, has drawn intense media scrutiny in the past ten . 
years and, according to professor of English Sara Suleri-Goodyear, 
has been "maligned out of proportion." Some professors claim that 
this hostility toward deconstruction determines the study of 
literature at Yale roday. 

Deconstruction, also known as the "Yale School" of literary 
criticism, presents a strategy for. reading which examines in detail 
the intricacies and contradictions of meaning and language. The 
theory arises from the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, a French 
philosopher who first 
proposed the idea that, due to rhe limited 
and contradicwry nature of language, no philosophy 
ultimately could offer its own foundation or justification. Derrida 
uses rhe word difftranc~ to refer to the indeterminate or arbitrary 
connection between a word and the idea it represents, language. 
Derrida points to the impossibiliry of finding a self-evident truth, 
because any truth must be described in an inherently limited 
language. He defends the methods of deconstruction as necessary 
because philosophy is not self-consciously aware of irs status as 
language, and he uses deconstruction to expose and break down 
these rhetorical devices. Literature, in contrast, has come to play 
an essential role in deconstructive theory as the only discourse that 
consistently recognizes and reveals irs dependence on language. 

As a critical movement, deconstruction peaked at Yale during 
the late 70s and early 80s. Paul de Man, then a professor in Yale's 
comparative literature department, was among the first to apply 
Derrida's theories to the study of literature. De Man's theories rely 
on the close analysis of a literary text to reveal inconsistencies 
hidden beneath layers of language. Deconstructionists prefer to call 
themselves "rhetorical readers," a term which emphasizes 
deconstruction's status as a method of reading. David Bromwich, 
professor of English, explains deconstruction as an "intense therapy 
of reading" that places a "peculiar emphasis on epistemological 
concerns," rhe ways in which knowledge and language inreracr. 

According to Michael Holquist, professor of comparative literature, 
deconstruction involved "examining the way in which the means 
that were used to construct a text constantly worked to do that, but 
at the same rime to foil the full articulation of what the text seemed 
to be intending." A deconstructive reading of any text always seeks 
to reveal contradictory meanings. 

According to Suleri-Goodyear, deconstruction simply continues 
the western tradition of skeptic philosophy: "Skepticism is based 
on a question. So when I'm talking about the ironies inherent in 
deconsrructive rhetoric, my reference is to precisely the act of 
formulating a question as a critical practice rather than providing 
an answer." This approach, she says, is "hardly new." To formulate 
such questions, the theory of deconstrucdon requires the 
dismantling of structure within a text and the examination of rhe 
limitations of language. Deconstruction exposes language as

which de Man stated 
that Jews "pollute" modern fiction and that a solution to the 
"Jewish problem" could be the "creation of a Jewish colony isolated 
from Europe." The revelation of de Man's wartime journalism 
provoked an avalanche of media coverage and intensified the 
existing debate over the political implications of de Man's 
deconstrucrive theories. 

IS n [ ncreased public use of the term has forced the expansion of the 
y 
technical meaning of "deconstruction." Paul Fry, professor of 
tt 
English, criticizes the media for debasing and overusing the 
erm. Much of the adulteration of the term stems from statements 
g aken out of context, such as Derrida's pronouncement Il n'y a pas 
's' ~ors du uxu ["There is no outside-text"]. Such quotes have been 
y ··~d to oversimplify deconstruction. "That is the cliche and the 
Y ntsreading," Suleri states. "To say that deconstruction means there 
5 
l nothing outside of the text can't be possible." The idea that 
J kconstruction requires the utter isolation of pure text led, in pan,

Criticized for being overly apolitical, deconstruction attempted 
to eliminate the assumption that "there is one form of truth that is 
more secure than any other," explains Bromwich. Critics took this 
to mean that deconstruction gave in to a basic nihilism, which 
could lead to totalitarian politics. "It was implied long before the 
revelations about [de Man's) wartime journalism that 
deconstruction was a kind of abyss or open door through which 
totalitarian politics could pass," explains Fry.
