Thought Old Blue was dead? Think again. 
At the Elizabethan Club it's always


A
little section of the Yale University Library System lies 
more obscure and sequestered than the darkest corner of 
the stacks. Its books line a six foot square, bomb-proof 
vault. Each Friday, one of six special librarians will turn 
the combination, twist the handle, swing open the door, unfasten 
the bars, and unshelve favorite classics. He might rake down a 
collection of plays in folio edition. He'd reach inro its glass case and 
open the tome inside to a withered page, mottled with age spots, a 
play like the Tempest or other famous first editions-Paradise Lost, 
The Faerie Queen, or Bacon's Essays. Visitors sign a register when 
they-leave, inscribing their names only pages after the signatures of 
such luminaries as Stephen Vincent Benet, james Thurber, Iris 
Murdoch, Allen Ginsberg, William Carlos Williams, and Robert 
Frost. When the lock slams shut, the books return to relative 
obscurity, tucked away in a quaint white house ~t 459 College 
Street. Dull against the forest green door, a bronze plare reads "The 
Elizabethan Club.'' 


As irs name suggests, the Club delights in anachronism. A 1920 
sketch of the house, by Theodore Diedrickson, 
could be a current rendering. Inside, the walls are 
wood-paneled, and the chairs worn mahogany 
leather. Renaissance portraits occupy the few spaces 
between shelves brimming with yellowed books. A 
period copy of Queen Elizabeth l's portrait surveys 
the scene while well-dressed students engage 
professors in polite conversation, nibbling on finger 
sandwiches and cookies. In pleasant weather, a few 
might play croquet. The accents lilt, inflections so 
refined that they verge on Oxbridge. Tea takes 
place daily from 4 to 6 o'clock. Matthew Lopes, the 
steward, unfailingly serves rhe Club's secret, smoky 
blend from silver rea pots into china cups. as he has 
for rhe past thirty-seven years. The accompan) ing 
sandwich is tomato on Mondays, cucumber on 
Tuesdays, then chicken salad, cinnamon toast, tuna 
fish, peanut buner and jelly, and dare bread on 
Sundays. Every week it is rhe same-always has 
been, always will be. The delicacies provide ample 
enricemenr for members to come, read, and 
congregate in quier corners. Tbar is how it's done at 
the "Lizzie"-sir, sip, study, and scintillate. 


OCTOBER 14, 1994 


ln 191 I, Alexander Cochran ( 1896) rebelled against the anti-
intellectualism of his era by founding a club to encourage "free and 
unaffeC£ed discussion" about the arts, literature, and religion. 
Cochran wanted to foster serious dialogue berween professors and 
srudents who rarely met outside of formal class lectures. He had 
developed a passion for Elizabethan literature in Professor William 
Lyon Phelps' famous course on Elizabethan drama, and he built the 
club around the books he acquired in England after graduation. An 
astonished Phelps could hardly believe that this previously 
unremarkable graduate was offering rhe university an "ascounding 
collection, every item a rarity." Yale enthusiastically accepted the 
gift, allowing Cochran to score the books in the clubhouse he 
donated. Club president and librarian, Steven Parks (SY '61) values 
the collection at twenty million dollars. Also establishing a 
$100.000 endowment, Cochran specified that the Club should 
limit dues to prevent "society men" from excluding less affiuent 
intellectuals. Today, a mere ten dollar membership fee buys access 
to a lifetime of food, conversation, and literature. 


Like the amenities, the conversation contrasts 
typical Yale fare. Vikram Mansharamani {SM '96) 
says thar in the thr<'e short mon hs he has been a 
member, he has natt "the must ~t i mula ting 
conversations I've ever had, not only intellectual, 
but also spiritual and emotional." From . 
throughout the building snippets of talk seem to g 
support his view. From the couch in the corner: .2, 
When Lionel Trilling lectured here, his favorite 
~ 
trick would be to walk into the classroom with a ~ 
pile of famous books and denounce each, throwing ~ 
rhem across the room and onto the floor. From the g.
