A Cornucopia of Capitalism 
Stew Leonard may be a crook, but his gargantuan grocery store provides 
only the best in fami ly-size values. 
by joel Burges 
As my old fritnd Andtca notes, "It's the largest dairy f:um in 
the world-
whar mort· is tht•rc to say?" Half an hour away. in 
Norwalk, Conne,ricur, lies Stew Leonard'~. Everyrhing about 
Stew's looms large, as ir ,t,pire~ w create an American dreamland 
for irs customers. As I turn inw the parking lor, a giganric decrric 
sign urges me t l forgo rhc apple picking adventure I had been 
planning this wn hnd: Afrn all, I can buy crisp locally grown 
apples for onl} 69 cents ,\ pound at Stew's. And if I'm a 
suburban parent, I c.ltl ptck up rwo pacb of Pampers at a 
cost of $13.89, and I'll save S.tOO! Maybe I'm worried 
about whar I'm going to \\hip roguher for dinner when 
spt·ci.tl on 1\:rduc whole or split chickens. 

A\ I park my tiny car among the Caravans, Range Rover~. and 
Volvos, I look up at rhc building I'm about ro enter. Lettering on 
the 'ide of the barn like srore declares that this is the "World's 
Largest D.llr} )tore A' Fc..uured In Ripley's &ii~v~ It Or Not." The 
word\ lure me inro rhi~ cornucopia of capitalism where, believe it 
or not, .til} thing c.m happen. Or so I'm led to believe. A~ I stroll 
/ 
into Stew's, a fake stone sign whi~ks

Although wday is a sedate day at

"\ 
Stew's, the store usually overflows 
{ c:- _/.,.) .;. 
with customers, especially on 
1(;0\ 
Saturdays and Sundays. The 
weekend hordes file through the 
!\ 
store in one direction, thus 
preventing traffic jams. Herded along 
like the cows Stew milks for profit, 
the customers progress roward the 
final destiny: the cash registers. Am I 
just another doUar here? 

r wander inro the bread section 
and tcast on thc vi~ ion of Vienna rolls. Why, it's just as if I am 
enjoying the comfons of an Austrian Bread & Breakfast! I 
imaginc bl"ing warmed by a piece of California sourdough 
bre.1d I have jmt taken our of the microwave. Memories of past 
fhanksgi,ing' tlitker about in my head as I ponder the freshly 
baked pumpkin pies. Stew isn't trying to manipulate me into 
·l"ving I'm ar home for the holidays, is he? I ta~te a free 
\ample of the apple crisp offered just to the righr of Stew's 
Dancin' Bagel. )rc\\ Leonard's is surely a relief for the 
c..usrorner tired of the chains thar rreat everybody the same. 
gh I do feel like I'm one of the thousands rhat make the 
journey through Stew's on a weekly basis. 

As I move down rhe one-way aisle, I wander past rhe 
machine\ char pa~rcurize and homogenize Stew's-or rather, 
his CO\\S'-rnilk. I read a sign which says rhat Srew Leonard's

sells over eleven million quarrs of milk each year. I even meet 
Clover, who has a button next to her head which I press to hear her 
mechanized moo. Stew creates these gimmicks, it seems, for the 
enterrainmcnt of children sitting in the carts being pushed around 
the store. There's one now, eating rhe ice cream cone her mother 
bought for her in front of rhe store. (Stew has frozen yogurr, roo, if 
you're worried about those extra pounds!) 

Yet rhe gimmicks appeal ro me roo. When I happen upon 
them, Stew's Farm Fresh Five band manage to 
endear themselves to me. I don't remember who 
rhe lead singer is, but the members include 
Lowfat, Skim, and Chocolate. Punch boxes back 
them up, singing "pack up your groceries in a 
Stew Leonard bag and smile, smile, smile!" Stew 
Leonard's resembles a musical. So here I am, 
charmed by the Farm Fresh Five, humming their 
tune as I wander through the dairy section, 
pausing to taste Stew's apple cider (of which I 
brought home a quart). On rhe threshold of the 
meat and poultry section, I find three plastic 
chickens, named after Stew's grandchildren. I 
press the button on the right, and Emma, Sarah, 
and Blake chatter and babble about milk and 
eggs. I look above them to the sign which 
reassures me with rhe words "We love to save you 
money." I am part of this brood of chickens, parr 
of the Leonard family-even if I am on a one-way 
conveyor belt ro a burdensome bill. However, as I 
turn the corner, Stew's disembodied face greets me 
with some grandfatherly affirmation and advice: 
"WE WANT YOU HAPPY. PLEASE! PLEASE! LET US 
Kl\:OW WHEN YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED ... AS QUICK AS 
A HASH WI: WILL RETURN MONEY OR REPLACE 
!!EMS." 

The cheese section is probably my favorite 
section. Among the yellow dairy products, I 
watch "The Candy Celery and Larry Lettuce 
Show." I once waited 20 minutes for the show to 
begin, skulking about looking at cheeses. I tried nor ro let people 
think I was actually lingering in order ro watch a head of lettuce 
and a stalk of celery sing, "We're Dole fresh vegetables. We're good 
OcOCTOBER 14, 1994 
for you. We're Dole fresh vegetables. We're good friends too." I 
sing the songs that a full-fledged Stew Leonard's customer sings. 
This realization doesn't sit well with me. 

Stew encourages his customers to befriend vegetables and 
fruit by offering savings of 38 cents on leeks, 56 cents on 
arrichokes, and 58 cents on pineapples. T he record-breaking 
amount of bananas rhe store sells is also noted for posterity in 
Ri ley's. Srew cares about rhe customer in me, and includes a 
sign with some health rips about eating 
fruit as I meander among 
I am pa 
chickens, part of the 
leonard family-even If I 
am on a one-way 
conveyor belt to a 
burdensome bill.

pomegranates, grapes, and kiwi. If I sray 
healrhy, rhen 1 can come back to buy more 
to ear in order ro stay healthy so I can buy 
more to eat ... 

Shuftling along into the frozen foods 
section (which is not large at Stew's and 
mostly filled with gourmet ice creams), I 
see a suburban mot~er charring wirh an 
employee, Freddie. I am amazed that rhe 
woman and Freddie seem ro know each 
other. She is telling him how it's a good 
thing he wasn't around one day when she 
was in a riff about the state of some of the 
pasta she bought. I'd be very concerned if 
Stew's employees starred saying to me, "It's 
nice to see you again Mr. Burges." But, 
unlike Freddie's friend, I don't live out my 
daily dramas in a grocery store. 

Stew, however, does create dramas out 
of his very own grocery store. In 1993, 
Connecticut discovered that he had been 
perpetrating the biggest tax-evasion scandal 
the state had ever seen. He misweighed 
hundreds of items-thousands of. 
consumers like Freddie's friend were paying 
more money for less merchandise.
