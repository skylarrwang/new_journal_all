Do you have what it takes to be one of the few, the proud, the 
Yalies Who. Stay? 
A
ter four hours of work, you drag yourself from your 
computer screen ro the window. You stare down for a 
momem at the turning leaves, at the buses barreling 
hrough puddles, and you smile. You might as well face 
it: you're seriously considering staying in New Haven. 
There-now you've said it. And once said, it might as well be 
said again. So you shrug on a coat, jump down a few flights of 
stairs, and run across the courtyard. 

Your friends, however, are less excited by your news. 
"Where do you think you're going to shop?" 
"You'll have to 
take the train into 
New York to get any 
kind of culture." 
"There's not even 
a McDonald's within 
walking distance-
you 
need 
Mc-
Donald's." 
Someone shrugs. "What do you want me to say? New Haven 
could use a few Yalies." 

And so you leave them, considerably less enthusiastic than 
before, wondering when they decided that New Haven was more a 
trial to get through than anything else. You wonder whether the 
city really does need more Yalies to stick around, or if that's just 
arrogance on the part of a bunch of over-educated cynics who 
think they understand New Haven's problems better than its 
permanent residents do. 

You know that a few Yaljes have slid into the New Haven 
political 
scene 
directly after grad-
uation, and you 
suppose they have a 
pretty good idea of 
what the city needs. 
But frankly, you 
can't read a Political 
Union flyer without 
gagging and aren't 
interested in run-
ning for anything. 
That last point, 
you think, may have 
some merit, but you 
tell them that you'll 
have a car, that you'll 
be able to make a fast 
food run whenever 
the spirit moves you. 
More importantly,

As you return to 
your room , you

union organizer since leaving Yale, laughs; 
"I really wouldn't be seeking that kind of 
community. I'm not looking for Yalies." 

After four years at Yale, other graduates 
who stick around may want to distance 
themselves from their alma mater. Still, 
judging by the responses from older 
graduates, only a few have remained for the 
long haul,- or else those who have aren't 
aware of one another. 

David Wilk (CC '72) can't name any 
former classmates living in New Haven 
offhand. Like many present-day Yalies, 
Wilk fled town after graduation. He 
roamed from Vermont to North Carolina, 
from South Carolina to Minnesota-only 
to wind up back in New Haven when he 
and a friend decided to open a wholesale 
book company. 

Likewise, Frank Logue (BK '48, LAW 
'51) spent a number of years in suburban

dreams, discourages

Trumbull, Connecticut, before returning to 
the city. In the 60s and early 70s, Logue 
devoted his time to establishing programs 
helping people from minority and low-
income backgrounds gain the tools and 
experience needed to better their 
communities. The Community Action 
Institute trains New Haveners as 
community leaders, and with the help of 
the Ford Foundation, the National Urban 
Fellows program uses similar techniques to 
"increase the supply of qualified minoriries 
in city management, explains Logue. The 
fellows receive a master's degree in urban 
studies after a summer semester at Yale, 
nine months assisting a mayor in an urban 
8 
center, and a final semester at Occidental 
College in California. 

After working with mayors, training 
activists, and even serving as alderman, 
Logue concluded that New Haven could 
use better government. Rather than let his 
experience go to waste, he ran for mayor. 
Even though he ran as a Democrat without 
the support of the Democratic machine, he 
won in 1975, and again in I 977. 

W
ether they choose politics or 
he private sector, most Yalies 
who have remained or returned 
share an extensive involvement in the city 
they h·ave adopted. Although Wick 
Chambers (BK '71) was born in New 
Haven and has never left, he says he isn't 
sure whether he ever intended to remain. 
As an undergraduate, · he focused more on 
getting .through Yale, on Vietnam, and on 
questions of right and wrong, than on 
planning for the future. Initially, he stayed 
in New Haven to finish his alternative 
service as a conscientious objector, but he 
soon found himself driving a taxi and 
dreaming of becoming a police officer. Cab 
driving, he thought, was the best way to 
learn the streets of the city. 

Although Chambers subsequently 
received the highest scores on the police 
academy's entrance exam, he was not 
admitted. Attributing his rejection to his 
status as a conscientious objector, he sued. 
While the lawsuit was pending, he 
attended academy classes anyway. His 
classmates thought he was a spy from the 
FBI or a Yale grad student writing his 
thesis, so they didn't speak to him during 
the first two weeks. He wound up with a 
former Green Beret as a ride partner, who 
finally sat him down over coffee and told 
him that the guys all thought he was an 
asshole because he would not back up his 
partner with a gun. Chambers explained 
that being a conscientious objector didn't 
make him a pacifist, and that he was 
certainly willing to use a gun. He had no 
more problems with his classmates, but he 
lost his suit and went to law school instead. 
He now practices law in New Haven. 

Maybe every Yalie who stays in New 
Haven needs a rite of passage similar to / 
Chambers' if he or she is to feel like part of 
the city. Unlike others who have wandered 
into such experiences, Readey has been 
struggling to reconcile his roles as Yalie and 
New Havener since his undergraduate days. 
But spending a summer in New Haven 
researching his senior essay made him fed 
almost entirely like a New Havener: he 
played basketball down at the courtS by 
Hillhouse High, dated an East Haven 
woman, and got to know his neighbors. 
Outing his senior year, Readey tried to 
implement a fellowship program for Yale 
,graduates who wanted to stay in New 
Ha.ven 
to 
work 
for 
non-profit 
organizations. The difficulty he ran into 
convinced him that "there is something 
that doesn't want people to stick around, 
that, beyond simply encouraging people to 
pursue their dreams, discourages them 
from remaining." 

That "discouraging something" remains 
ambiguous. Danna ·schneider says she 
adapted quickly to life in New Haven. In 
fact, all remaining Yalies share an eagerness 
to catalogue the city's good points-points 
that many say undergraduates do not 
appreciate. Former alderman Stefan Pryor 
(SM '93) ascribes what he calls the city's 
tremendous character to its many distinct 
communities. Logue enthusiastically

describes the arts scene, saying "It's possible 
to be a full-rime culture nut in this city." 

It is not always clear whether Yalies 
remain because ·of New Haven's strengths 
or whether their enthusiasm signals a 
reaction against the area's lukewarm 
reputation and undergraduate complaints. 
As Schneider says, "I get very impatient 
with the bitching that goes on about New 
Haven."

acknowledge the ciry's many ailments, but 
while some rattle off a list of "poverty, 
drugs, and crime" as fast as any undergrad, 
living in the ciry has given them a closer 
look at urban problems than most students 
perceive through the gates of their 
residential colleges. Both Logue and 
Readey say that one of the ciry's problems 
is the failure of residents of surrounding 
suburbs to realize that a healthy central ciry 
is in their own interest-a failure of which 
many undergraduates may also be guilry. 

Or perhaps the universiry should share 
some of the blupe. Despite recent 
initiatives, Readey claims that the 
University doesn't do nearly enough for 
New Haven. Schneider goes further and 
accuses Yale of actually harming the ciry by 
buying up more and more of New 
Haven-"like a little Pac-Man." She calls 
New Haven Yale's company town, and says 
that, of all the communiry service programs 
running out of Dwight Hall, none solves 
the problem of how Yale treats its workers. 

Community service among Yalies is 
important, say graduates, though not an 
essential qualification for long-term 
residence in New Haven. Perhaps they 
hope that the actions of individual 
undergraduates will compensate for 
historically 
strained 
town-gown 
relationships. In some way, each Yalie who 
remains also atones for a shared sense of 
guilt toward the ciry. 

Bur not everyone agrees how much 
community service accomplishes. While 
the amount of service Yale students 
perform today impresses Logue, Schneider 
says that the community service most 
students do is a joke. She agrees that some 
have good hearts and do try, but believes 
that too many approach the ciry with the 
attitude that they are performing charity 
work. Pryor, who says he came to Yale to 
experience an urban environment, believes 
that numerous Yalies arrive with similar 
goals. Most undergraduates, though, would 
laugh at this sentiment. Even Wilk, who 
spent time as an undergraduate establishing 
a food co-op and trying to set up a 
communiry center, maintains that students 
do not come to Yale to get involved in the 
city. Furthermore, they should not be 
expected to. Their job, he says, is to be 
students. 

N
d so you lie on your bed, hands 
notted beneath your head, and 
onder exactly what you owe the 
ciry. You don't buy the line that you have 
an obligation to get involved in New 
Haven life as much as possible. And you 
don't believe that if you stay you have to 
run for office or join a half-dozen 
organizations in order to make your 
rc:sidency count for something. But at the 
same time, you're sick of your friends and 
their jokes about their chances of being 
mugged or shot on their way back from 
their Wednesday night section. You're sick 
of their bitching about the dry's lack of 
culture when what they mean by "culture" 
is a better mall or a bigger movi~ theatre. 
You really don't even know why you like 
the city, when it comes down to it, or why 
you should stay here rather than go almost 
anywhere else. You wonder whether you 
need to go to school to drive a cab, or if 
you can just show up.
