his fall, amidst the bustle of the semester's opening days, 
one student walks irtto Book H aven to purchase the 
volumes for his romantic poetry class. Another shuffles · 
through the Yale Co-op's aisles in search of her particle 
physics text. Neither of our academic stick figures faces much of an 
economic decision. They might not purchase the books if they are 
financially strapped. There's always CCL for the frugal, or the naive, 
who have not yet heard of per-minute fines. Most likely they suck it 
up and charge it. 

The students' money will play a huge role in the economic 
success of the bookstore, but the traditional consumer decision of 
where to purchase one's goods has already been made. Professors 
make that decision for all of their students when they choose a 
bookstore through which to order books or a copy shop through 
which to order course packets. 

M
ost Yale professors choose either the Co-op or Book Haven 
to distribute their books. The Co-op has been an option 
for over a century; Book Haven emerged on the scene in 
1978, when Henry Schwab (MC '63)-known simply as Henry to 
many humanities professors--opened shop. Henry's personality and 
friendships are key to Book Haven's success. Common sense dictates, 
and the Book Haven story has proven, that professors bring their 
students' money to their friends' stores. Book Haven now carries 
many coursebooks for the history and English departments. 

Professors in these departments often shop for themselves in Book 
Haven, and the transition to ordering coursebooks by the hundred 
follows easily in their minds. 

Many professors view the huge Co-op as an inefficient 
bureaucracy when it comes to ordering books. Those who have had a 
bad experience in the past respond by bringing their students' 
business to Book Haven. Robert Watson, Director of Undergraduate 
Studies of the decidedly bookish Directed Studies program, has 
brought an enri·re table of coursebook business to Book Haven 
because of hls past experience with "such bad service from the Co-
op." History professor Gaddis Smith (PC '54, GRAD '61) explains 
that in the past, the Co-op notoriously under-ordered when he made 
his decision. "I would tell them I'd have a class of 300, and they 
would decide only to order 200 books." 

Only 200. Professors accuse the Co-op of 
impersonal service--a symptom of irs size, no doubt. 

Schwab can joke with professors in the check-out line; Paul 
Miserindino, who heads the Co-op's textbook department, has a 
much longer list of names to try to remember. This is not for lack of 
trying, however. Miserindino takes ambiguous comments about 
"personal service" as character assaults. "I talk to professors," he 
pleads. "I have a phone." In fact, Miserindino maintains that his 
deparrment is the only one in the Co-op not looking to increase its 
gross profit margin. "We consistently put service ahead of profits," he 
says. 

· 
Regardless of whether service actually increases under this 
strategy, profits definitely "decrease. To counteract the damage to the 
bottom line, which the Co-op must endure in order to maintain its 
primary goal of serving the Yale community, the Co-op tries to save 
money by occasionally under-ordering to avoid returning books. It 
turns down no book order, no matter how unprofitable, and it carries 
nearly all course textbooks, which sell for a measly 25 percent 
margin. Paperbacks ordered by humanities professors yield a more 
comfortable 35-40 percent, the profits most often lost to Book 
Haven. 

According to Henry, this 10-15 percent windfall is merely a 
coincidence. "We have had science textbooks in the past, and we've 
tried to get more of them,"he says. Specifically, Henry points out that 
hls business has carried computer science books over the years, and 
that he recently mailed letters to Group IV professors in an effort to 
attract more of their business. It seems odd, however, that this 
business would be desirable to Henry: the gross profit margin on 
these textbooks is so low that only a very large volume can make 
them profitable. Henry himself points out, "We're just not a big 
enough store to stock the science books." 

Although Book Haven is certainly the "little guy" in the battle of 
the books, it has become a fairly mainstream alternative. Smith has 
proven that other book retailers can provide satisfactory service by 
ordering his books through the Foundry Bookstore on Whitney 
Avenue. Smith's preference shows just how arbitrarily such significant 
financial decisions are made. When asked why he made the decision 
ten years ago to carry books through the Foundry rather than 
through another Co-op substitute, he responds simply, "They were 
closer at hand. I walk by them aU the time." 

Whereas many professors seem to choose a 
bookstore merely for reasons of proximity, 
professors in at least two departments regularly send
