EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This semester, the main conver­
sations around fossil fuel divest­
ment took place in two listening 
sessions with the CFFIP attended 
by student leaders and activists. 
Elaine Louden MPH ’22, a mem­
ber of the Graduate and Profes­
sional Student Senate, told me, 
“In [The Ethical Investor] itself, I 
don’t see a lot of problems. I think 
it’s more about how people inter­
pret what is in the book.” Before 
the release of the CFFIP report, 
she expressed dissatisfaction with 
how student concerns had been 
received—as did Jordi Bertrán 
Ramírez ’24, a YCC Senator and 
Sustainable Policy Co-Chair who 
was also present at the listen­
ing sessions. Louden, who first 
engaged in the divestment debate 
at Yale in this session, found it to 
be a disappointing introduction. 
She felt that there was an absence 
of voices who could speak to the 
impact of climate change from a 
public health perspective. When I 
asked Macey about the students’ 
characterizations of the listen­
ing sessions, he admitted that 
the committee had not commu­
nicated as openly as they should 
have at the initial meeting. “They 
may not feel heard,” Macey said. 
“I feel horrible about that—but 
they changed my mind about a 
couple of issues.” He hoped that 
when students read the commit­
tee’s report, however, they would 
see their arguments reflected and 
addressed in the text.


Bertrán Ramírez said, “Upon 
reading the report, a lot of what 
was enclosed in that document 
were near-direct quotes of what 
students had said in our meet­
ing with the CFFIP, which was 
surprising, to say the least.” He 
referred specifically to the por­
tions which emphasized the pro­
ducer’s responsibility in limiting 
the availability of fossil fuels, 
when in the past the committee 
had often argued that it was the 
duty of consumers to limit their 
consumption and the job of the 
government to regulate. He con­
veyed the sense of empowerment 
that comes with seeing the real 
outcomes of student activism. He 
also expressed hope that students 
might have a say in the imple­
mentation of the CFFIP princi­
ples—especially when it comes to 
selecting the specific companies 
from which the University will 
divest. This is a possibility that 
depends largely on the receptivity 
of the administration. 


Even before the release of the 
CFFIP report and its adoption 
into Yale’s investment policy by 
the Corporation, activists at Yale 
had their next steps planned. Scott 
Gigante GRD ’23 organized the 
Yale Forward campaign to elect 
a Yale alum to the Corporation. 
The campaign’s candidate, Mag­
gie Thomas ENV ’15, suspended 
her run in accordance with 
White House ethics rules in order 
to become Chief of Staff of the 
Office of Domestic Foreign Pol­
icy earlier this year. Yale Forward 
is still pushing for a more diverse 
Corporation, 
however, 
which 
might utilize the University’s 
platform to encourage broader 
social change.


When I spoke with Gigante, he 
skipped the customary talking-
points 
of 
divestment 
almost 
entirely. “We need to think about 
not just divesting as a political act 
but investing as a political act,” he 
said. Such social impact investing 
would step beyond the socially 
responsible investing policy enu­
merated in The Ethical Investor, 
taking into consideration not just 
the prevention of harm but the 
promotion of good. He cited the 
Rockefeller Brothers Fund and 
the Gates Foundation, both of 
which have earmarked small per­
centages of their endowments for 
social impact investing. Macey, 
however, expressed doubts about 
social impact investing, wonder­
ing if a measure like that would 
limit the University’s ability to 
provide financial aid or hire new 
faculty. 


Gigante takes issue not only 
“We need to think about not just 
divesting as a political act
but investing as a political act.”


with the limited guidelines in 
The Ethical Investor but also with 
their execution: “In terms of the 
ACIR, I see not just an accessibil­
ity problem or a disincentive to 
participate, but actually a lack of 
accountability and a lack of man­
date.” The ACIR—the main vehi­
cle for student input—conducts 
private conversations and issues 
nonbinding 
recommendations 
which may or may not be made 
public. For this reason, in many 
instances, students may not see 
the results of their advocacy.


Macey made clear to me that 
he wants his committees to be 
transparent and communicative. 
Although it does not argue that 
investment decisions should be 
predicated on popular opinion, 
The Ethical Investor tasks the ACIR 
with making recommendations 
to the Corporation in response 
to “requests from members of the 
university community,” a man­
date which is founded on the 
ability of the committee to medi­
ate between students and trustees. 
Gigante and Bertrán Ramírez—
the two activists with whom I 
followed up after the release of 
the 
CFFIP 
report—expressed 
differing degrees of satisfaction. 
Bertrán Ramírez’s anticipation 
especially came across: “We are 
at the cusp of something.” Ear­
lier, he and Gigante had spoken 
of their engagement with The 
Ethical Investor as necessary to 
communicate with Yale’s pow­
ers-that-be. At the time, they did 
not feel heard by the Yale admin­
istration. Although those emo­
tions may have changed with the 
release of the report, which Ber­
trán Ramírez describes as a win 
brought about by nearly a decade 
of student activism, Gigante still 
worries that the efficacy of the 
CFFIP’s principles will be limited 
by the decision-making struc­
ture. He sees a pattern emerging 
of an institution slow to respond 
to valid demands for change, a 
“now-typical ten year timespan 
for the Corporation to respond 
to concerns of investor respon­
sibility, as has been the case in 
both Apartheid divestment and 
fossil fuel divestment.” It is an 
issue which both he and Bertrán 
Ramírez feel may be remedied by 
more direct student engagement 
with the Corporation and clearer 
conversations with the admin­
istration on questions regarding 
both divestment and investment. 


At the very beginning of my 
first conversation with Jonathan 
Macey he referred to The Ethi­
cal Investor as the Bible of Yale’s 
investment 
policy—not 
solely 
for its importance but also for its 
endless debatability. Gunnemann 
later analogized it to the Consti­
tution, emphasizing that it is not 
a text which one should interpret 
with an originalist mindset. He 
hopes that the document encour­
ages 
evolving 
conversations 
about the difficulties of investing 
responsibly. 


The Ethical Investor is no longer 
a young document—2022 will 
mark the fiftieth anniversary of its 
publication. As may occur with 
any statement of principles, over 
time a changing context has ren­
dered parts of its content insuffi­
cient. Activists will continue to 
pose important questions. Should 
students be named to the Cor­
poration? The ACIR disbanded 
in favor of more direct access to 
trustees? Does The Ethical Investor 
frame the conversation in a way 
that fosters engagement? Perhaps 
it is time for a repeat of that 1969-
70 seminar at the Law School, to 
respond to these proposals and 
many more. In whatever forum 
they take place, however, ongo­
ing conversations will have to 
recognize the validity of such 
questions, the limitations of the 
current system, and the necessity 
of self-critical examination.
