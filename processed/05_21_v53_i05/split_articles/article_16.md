EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a mellow afternoon in 
early April, the Downtown Eve­
ning Soup Kitchen’s new drop-in 
center hosted its soft opening. 
A sign in an archetypal Home­
goods-Mom style hung above 
my head, fiercely combining 
both Comic Sans and cursive: 
COFFEE, PRAYER & CON­
VERSATION 
Always welcome here.

And it was right, minus the 
prayer: coffee and conversa­
tion dominated the space. Even 
though clients came for a vari­
ety of reasons—food, outlets, 
Wi-Fi, the bathroom—everyone, 
it seemed, ended up moving from 
a water-hungry Keurig to seating 
areas where other peers and vol­
unteers perched.

The space was smaller than I 
expected—more a room than a 
floor. It was cozier than antici­
pated, too, in part due to its fur­
nishings: orange chairs tucked 
into green-marbled tables, red 
brick walls, blue-grey-tiled floors 
interspersed 
with 
red-painted 
support columns, a satisfyingly 
full bookshelf, and stacked boxes 
of board games. There was no 
immediate evidence that the 
room was formerly home to a 
dog grooming salon, a (human) 
hair salon, and a businessmen’s 
lunch club at various points in 
time.

I volunteered on the fifth day of 
operation at the new Downtown 
Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK) 
location at 266 State Street. It was 
my first day there. Before, in the 
few days since opening, only two 
or three people had wandered 
in, my supervisor told me––but 
today, seven or eight clients 
gradually gathered in the space. 
After showing me a series of 
adorable cat TikToks on his 
phone, one client, seated by him­
self with a French vanilla roast 
from the Keurig, invited me to 
ask him questions. He provided 
an answer before I asked any.
“It’s hard to find a place to be,” 
he said. “I’ve been homeless for 
twenty-five years. I think that’s 
the hardest thing.” 


The Downtown Evening Soup 
Kitchen has provided food assis­
tance out of the basement of the 
Parish House of Center Church 
on Temple Street (steps from the 
Green) since 1987, born from 
an era of welfare cutbacks that 
caused a soup kitchen resurgence 
not seen since the Great Depres­
sion. While the church is still in a 
convenient location for the pop­
ulation it serves, the space is both 
cramped and hard to access, a set 
of stairs being the only entrance 
to the underground dining space. 
When the doors open at meal­
times, clients tend to grab their 
food and go—there is little lin­
gering, according Steve Werlin, 
DESK’s Executive Director. This 
makes it even harder for service 
workers, like mental health coun­
sellors, to connect with clients in 
an already-crowded space. The 
Parish House location will con­
tinue to serve meals to clients, but 
the new space on State Street will 
supplement it outside of meal­
times with designated floors for 
both basic and higher-level ser­
vices. 

The new location is only two 
blocks from the Green, nestled 
between Café Nine and a tattoo 
parlor, ShowOff Ink Artistry. 
While looking for a building to 
buy, in addition to securing a 
spot on prime real estate in prox­
imity to the Green, DESK’s lead­
ership had looked for neighbors 
who would not feel hindered by 
the presence of the drop-in cen­
ter. 

Restaurants, studios, and bou­
tiques are generally not ideal 
neighbors, according to Werlin, 
because of their dependence on 
people walking around between 
stores, who may be deterred by 
the presence of clients at a place 
like DESK. The 266 State Street 
location is advantageous because 
it has no neighbours across the 
street; instead, there’s a park. 
ShowOff Ink Artistry mainly 
serves repeating customers, less 
so roaming pedestrians, and Café 
Nine serves customers in the eve­
nings when DESK’s doors are 
closed.

“We want to be good neigh­
bors,” said Werlin. “We want to 
ensure that this is a service that 
is a net gain for them, for the 
neighborhood and for the com­
munity.” Werlin cited bathrooms 
as an example. “All these busi­
nesses that don’t want people 
who are on the street coming in 
to use the bathroom. Well, here’s 
a solution for that.”

The drop-in center’s first floor 
has been designed precisely to 
provide a place to be for its cli­
ents. It will be an air-conditioned 
haven in hot summers, a heated 
one in the winters, and a host 
year-round for restrooms, show­
ers, food, beverages, Wi-Fi, and 
social interaction.

Soon, a second floor will open 
that 
will 
provide 
designated 
spaces for mental health counsel­
ling, health care, meetings with 
caseworkers, and other support 
from New Haven organizations,
