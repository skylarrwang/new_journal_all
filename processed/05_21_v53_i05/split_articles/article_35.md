EDWARD B. BENNETT III 
MEMORIAL FELLOWSHIP
Do you have a story that you want to tell about  Yale or New Haven that requires in-
depth reporting beyond the Elm City? Then apply for the Edward B. Bennett III Me­
morial Fellowship! For an EBMF-supported article, think about the national implications 
of local stories. The Fellowship commemorates the late Edward “Edder” B. Bennett III, 
Yale College Class of 1983, who revived The New Journal after a period of dormancy and 
served as its publisher in the early nineteen-eighties. For an EBMF-supported article, 
think about the national implications of local stories. You might propose investigating 
how a particular issue pertinent to New Haven has been felt in other cities, or how Yale 
has influenced (or been influenced by) a far-away place like Singapore or Sitka.  
Fellows are expected to publish their articles in The New Journal within six months of re­
ceiving the award. Applications for summer projects will be due by May 28, 2021. Please 
email them to editors@thenewjournalatyale.com. Please also feel free to reach out with 
any questions!
Your application, due to us by May 28, 2021, should include the following: 
1.	 A one-page proposal for the article you would like to write. Please tell us: what the 
article is about, how the article relates to Yale or New Haven, what the overarching 
questions will be, why this article should be written now, and why you think it is 
nationally significant. 
2.	 A writing sample, either journalistic or academic. (If you have it, journalism is highly 
preferred.) 
3.	 A budget detailing likely reporting expenses—such as transportation, court document 
fees, translation fees, or anything else. Please describe in detail how travel would 
enhance your proposed story. We expect awards to be on average around $1,000—if 
you have a strong proposal that requires more support, please be specific in explain­
ing why.
