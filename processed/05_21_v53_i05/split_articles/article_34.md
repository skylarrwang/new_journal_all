attention to anyone, he seeks no 
one’s help or opinions, and con­
siders everyone an opponent to 
his agenda. In a word, the indi­
vidual loses his sense of empathy. 
This is the character of American 
individualism today. It has gone 
amok. Kindness and compas­
sion have become bêtes noires in 
modern American society. The 
American individualist seems to 
disregard the interest of the com­
munity. We need not look to his­
tory books to know this is true. 
The evidence is right before our 
eyes. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has 
brought to the fore the danger of 
American individualism. While 
doctors and healthcare work­
ers risk their lives to save every­
one’s, the simple act of wearing 
a mask—an act of kindness to 
protect all of us—has been polit­
icized, dismissed, and construed 
as an infringement on individual 
rights. For all the stories I heard 
about America as a child growing 
up in another country, I never 
imagined that individuals would 
be so self-seeking that they would 
ignore the common good. They 
refuse to grasp that the common 
good is quintessentially the sum 
of individual goods and that the 
destruction of the common good 
is necessarily the destruction of 
each individual good.   

But staunch proponents of 
American individualism or “rug­
ged individualism” lament that 
this account doesn’t favor per­
sonal freedom, for what is the 
individual then, they say, if she 
cannot do as she pleases, but must 
conform to the collective interest? 
They pontificate that the individ­
ual ought to be allowed to pursue 
her own desires independent of 
any external influence if she is to 
be truly free. 

But the common interest does 
not exclude the individual inter­
est. In 2014, Liberia experienced 
one of the deadliest Ebola out­
breaks in recent memory. Many 
lives were lost. For a time, people 
claimed that the epidemic was a 
hoax and that health restrictions 
were 
counterproductive. 
Like 
some Americans of today, there 
were Liberians who refused to 
wash or sanitize their hands while 
in public spaces. Whole commu­
nities followed suit. But in those 
areas where individuals acted to 
protect themselves, thereby pro­
tecting others, the cases quickly 
dropped. Eventually, people fol­
lowed health guidelines thor­
oughly. In every shop, store 
and supermarket I entered, and 
in every household, it became 
mandatory to wash your hands 
and maintain social distancing. 
Community leaders, government 
officials and members of political 
parties went across the country 
raising public awareness about 
Ebola. Liberia eradicated Ebola 
because everyone started to live 
according to our conception of 
individualism: help everyone, do 
harm to no one. Because of the 
lessons of Ebola, Liberia’s total 
number of confirmed COVID-19 
cases is less than 2,200 in twelve 
months, 
compared 
to 
about 
eleven thousand Ebola cases in 
fifteen months. For a poor coun­
try with congested cities and 
towns, Liberia was not expected 
to maintain such low COVID-19 
infection rates. 

Although I am saddened by the 
nearly ninety people who have 
died in Liberia from COVID-19, 
I find solace in the fact that things 
are not as awful as they were in 
2014, because individual Libe­
rians know the benefit of acting 
in the common interest. Libe­
rian individualism is based on a 
sense of duty to community and 
humanity and the recognition 
that each person needs a giant’s 
shoulders on which to stand. 
American individualism would 
benefit from learning the same.
