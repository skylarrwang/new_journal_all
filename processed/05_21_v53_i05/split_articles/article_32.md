EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
first yield myself completely to 
listening—to understanding and 
picturing the author’s imagined 
world. Only through listening 
can I come close to the central 
truth of the story and then sustain 
it myself. 

Once 
I 
stepped 
into 
the 
uncharted geographies of these 
texts, I became aware of what 
enabled me to keep travel­
ling through them: my ability 
to observe. For me, this kind of 
observation can only follow a 
surrender to imagination. This 
pairing of imagination and obser­
vation ran through my every day. 
I imagined entire worlds and 
noticed their contents as I moved 
through my own empty and 
familiar landscape. As I walked 
through a deserted New York, I 
lived in the worlds I read of and 
walked the paths I made through 
them. In Central Park, staring at 
the now perpetually empty Great 
Lawn, I gazed at J.M. Coetzee’s 
South African veldts. In the gar­
dens of the Cathedral of Saint 
John the Divine, I strolled with 
Virginia Woolf through the ver­
dant grounds of Oxford. Alone 
save for the cathedral guard 
who checked my temperature, I 
watched her firm stride, the germ 
of A Room of One’s Own newly 
fertile in her mind. 

As the writer Hernán Diaz 
recently said in a lecture at Yale, 
it is not fiction that is the oppo­
site of truth. Falsehood is. Fiction 
contains truth at its heart. And 
if imagination and observation 
are the tools we use to engage 
with novels, fiction and truth are 
their respective fruits. My life has 
been in large part composed of 
a plurality of these truths: truths 
that express themselves in fic­
tion, but are not false. At their 
best, these truths express what 
it is to grow up differently than 
I did: the truth of growing up a 
boy, of being a wizard, of fac­
ing racism. I cannot truly know 
these truths, but by setting them 
alongside one another, I aim to 
see from more than just my own 
perspective. Our lives are a “pro­
cess of continual fictionalization, 
as we internalize the other-we-
are-not, dramatize them, imagine 
them, speak for them and through 
them,” writes Zadie Smith. Like 
Smith, I traverse several different 
countries of the imagination.

By April 10, New York lost 
about three thousand people every 
four days. While to my friends 
in other regions of the coun­
try, the pandemic still seemed 
remote, it moved much closer to 
me. Friends lost one grandpar­
ent, then both. My sister’s father 
got very sick. My friend’s father 
died. Every week I would walk to 
buy groceries for an 85-year-old 
relative, and on the way I’d pass 
the hospital behind my reading 
hill. A policewoman stopped me 
from crossing the street: bodies, 
one by one, were being carried in 
grey bags to a freezer truck across 
the street. After I delivered my 
groceries and sat ten feet away 
from my relative for a few hours, 
I went the long way around, back 
to my hill to read. 

Devoid of the people and 
places that had populated my life 
before, I was filled with absence. 
Exiled from Yale, unable to see 
friends and family, and almost 
done with the semester, I had 
no idea what I wanted. Reading 
about what other people usually 
do, I thought, would be a good 
place to start. And so I began: in 
Michael Cunningham’s West Vil­
lage, Jenny Erpenbeck’s Berlin, 
and James Baldwin’s Harlem. I 
began to reconstruct myself. 

When people’s lives drastically 
change—a move, a death, a career 
change, a breakup—they often deal 
with it through action: doing new 
things and meeting new people. 
Instead I read about new people 
doing new things, and delighted in 
the dialogue they engaged me in. 
When you read, especially during 
a national emergency, you have to 
imagine the world into which you 
step. You have to imagine other 
people’s lives to fill the space, and 
in the process, you begin to imag­
ine your own. Suddenly, you’re 
able to apply the same creative 
vision, the same perceptive alert­
ness, to what you might want and 
who you might want to be. 

What does this new life of 
mine look like? Unsurprisingly, it 
is filled with books. I want a life 
where I can think about books as 
much as I would like. To write, 
but also to read. I want, I realized, 
to be an editor—to take the com­
passion I’d learned through imag­
ining so many unfamiliar lives, 
and turn it towards new stories, 
fledgling stories, that I could help 
release into the world. In my own 
writing, I want to think through 
diverse theories and possibilities of 
fiction. And to do this, I have to 
keep reading. 

To read in this new way, I have 
to leave my world and step out 
into space, simply listening. I dis­
covered how to yield completely 
without losing myself, which is, I 
think, the same thing as falling in 
love. I had learned to fall in love 
with other people’s stories, with 
the pen still poised to write my 
own.
