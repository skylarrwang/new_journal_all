First thing in the morning, I 
braced myself for another rejection. But by some miracle, today 
was different than the last ten 
days; today, an operator finally 
picked up. After a week and 
a half of making groggy 8:00 
a.m. phone calls, staring at “no 
appointments available” messages, 
and listening to the locust drone 
of busy signals across various vaccine hotlines, I was starting to 
think I’d never find an appointment for Sam, a jovial older man 
from Guilford. Sam was my first 
client for the Vaccine Buddies 
volunteer program, a joint initiative between the Connecticut 
Agency on Aging and Interfaith 
Volunteer Care Givers (IVCG) to 
help seniors secure COVID-19 
vaccines. 

Vaccines 
became 
generally 
available to New Haven residents 
75 and older on January 18, 2021. 
Just four days later, I received a 
Vaccine Buddies invitation email 
from Jane Ferrall, the executive 
director of IVCG. At the end of 
the email, she urged: “Right now 
is a historic time for us to rally 
round and help our seniors when 
and where they need it most…
and if not now, when?” I wouldn’t 
meet Jane until months later, but 
her passion for service resonated 
through her writing.  

By the end of March, Vaccine 
Buddies and other IVCG volunteers had made over 150 appointments for seniors aged 65+ and 
provided medical transportation 
to over 750 clients, highlighting 
not only the power of volunteerism but also that of faith-based organizations to provide 
vital social services in times of 
need. Though it is no longer an 
explicit faith-based organization, 
IVCG has its roots in religious 
practice that still informs many 
of its volunteers and staff, including Jane herself. The “Interfaith” 
in IVCG’s moniker pays homage 
to IVCG’s parent organization, 
Interfaith 
Cooperative 
Ministries (ICM), through which many 
present-day social service organizations in New Haven received 
their initial seed funding and 
institutional 
backing. 
Columbus House, Downtown Evening 
Soup Kitchen, and the Greater 
New Haven Community Loan 
Fund, which has funded development for over 2,500 housing units 
in New Haven, are just a few of 
such organizations.

Despite its far reach, I had 
never heard of ICM until Jane 
mentioned it to me. First established in 1970 as “Downtown 
Cooperative Ministries” by a couple of mainline churches, ICM 
formally closed its doors in 2015. 
Since then, Jane lamented, very 
few people seem to be interested 
in learning about its “fascinating” 
history. 

“In the late seventies and eighties, people were very concerned 
about what was 
happening 
to 
New Haven,” Jane 
told me. A former 
lawyer, she spoke 
with 
deliberate 
pauses, giving her 
words an air of 
gravitas. 
“There 
was already this 
huge 
problem 
homelessness. There was 
a terrible divide 
between 
Black 
and white. There 
was 
this 
economic divide. 
The 
problems 
that New Haven 
has today are the 
they 
were 
having 
back in the nineteeneighties.” 

Churches, 
especially 
those 
on 
the New Haven 
Green, were experiencing 
these 
issues 
first-hand, 
and the original 
members of ICM 
felt called to do 
something about 
it. Some church 
members felt that it was not only 
their civic responsibility but also 
their religious calling to help the 
city, so they decided to create an 
interfaith ministry that, at least in 
the early years, was entirely self-
funded and operated. 

Like many other social service 
organizations, ICM was born 
out of a specific time with specific needs. “The nineteen-sixties 
were, as some will remember, 
a traumatic period for making 
everyone, including churches, 
face up to the highly sharpened 
liberation 
which 
beginning to emerge in terms 
of housing in neighborhoods, 
job discrimination, et cetera,” 
the late Reverend Dr. Samuel N. 
Slie, a previous ICM coordinator 
and prominent New Haven faith 
leader, said in a 1999 interview 
about ICM’s history. While the 
post-war rise in poverty was not 
unique to New Haven, few other 
cities had such an overwhelming 
response by the church.

Downtown Cooperative Ministries changed its name to Interfaith 
Cooperative Ministries in 
1995 to welcome organizations of 
other non-Christian faiths. ICM’s 
early 
initiatives 
included committees to address poverty, politics, and 
racism. Throughout 
the late twentieth 
century, 
ICM also funded 
over twenty other 
organizations that 
served the community financially. 
A look at their 
annual 
reports 
demonstrates their 
remarkable sensitivity to and flexibility for responding 
various 
needs. In 2008, for 
example, ICM and 
affiliate organizations 
responded 
rapidly to the economic crisis, raising $150,000 to 
keep an overflow 
shelter open until 
May 2009 despite 
the city’s budget 
cuts. 

“The 
DCM 
established a pattern,” Slie said in his 1999 interview, “which persists today, of 
sticking its neck out where there is 
a need, [and] asking the churches 
to help fund an outreach…[to] be 
able to develop a board, incorporate, acquire a staff, and find federal, foundation or private funds 
to help meet the needs.” 

ICM declined in financial and 
political influence in the twententens until its formal dissolution in 2015. Some attribute its 
decline to obsolescence, as its 
affiliate 
organizations 
self-sufficient, while others point 
to deeper organizational and 
ideological issues. Since 2015, 
no new interfaith organizations 
have come to the fore. According 
to IVCG Director Jane Ferrall, 
New Haven may be unlikely to 
see another major interfaith force 
in the future because of increasing secularization, fewer permanent residents with deep roots in 
the city, and the current trend 
towards churches “going their 
own way,” particularly in nondenominational institutions. Furthermore, the mainline churches 
that have been the strongest supporters of ICM are now struggling to care for their own. “I 
know this because I’m a part of 
one of these churches,” Ferrall 
said with resignation.

Still, Ferrall argues that what 
current faith-based organizations 
are doing is no less impactful. 
“Faith communities, if you would 
look at the cumulative impact…
it’s profound,” she said. “There 
is no way that the government 
could meet the need. There’s no 
way they could be nimble enough, 
[or] non-bureaucratic enough to 
meet the need.” The evidence is 
close to home in ICM’s history 
and even today through programs 
like Vaccine Buddies. IVCG’s 
small size and autonomy, as well 
as their perceived faith affiliation 
that may appeal to potential volunteers, allowed them to mobilize 
a volunteer force as early as January. A similar vaccine program 
organized by the New Haven 
Board of Alders (led by Alder Eli 
Sabin), on the other hand, did not 
launch until March 13. Where 
government programs struggle, 
faith-based services help fill in 
crucial gaps. 

Today, many faith-based communities work not only to provide social services but to do so 
in a way that is sensitive to the 
needs of different groups. In New 
Haven, where racial segregation 
and opportunity disparities run 
deep, this often includes activism 
that goes beyond providing specific charitable services, which 
certain church leaders have found 
profoundly lacking. The Revd. 
Doctor Samuel T. Ross-Lee, the 
lead pastor at the Black church 
Immanuel Missionary Baptist, has 
not seen much faith-based activism in his twenty years in New 
Haven. Ross said that while there 
is much “blanket support” from 
other faith communities, there has 
been a frustrating lack of political 
activism. 

In both their failures and successes, faith-based social organizations are ultimately more similar to their secular counterparts 
than they are different. In New 
Haven in particular, the lines 
between the two have become 
increasingly blurred, with some 
formally religious institutions like 
IVCG becoming secular in legal 
status, though not in ideology 
or leadership, and some secular 
institutions shifting to faith-based 
frameworks because of their leading members’ faith. Still, there is 
something to be said about the 
differentiating factor of faith itself. 
Faith may provide a motivation 
for social work, where there otherwise may not be one internally, 
or give community members a 
hope that nurtures perseverance 
even when things aren’t going 
well. It is this hope that inspires 
many faith-based service organizations and community advocates 
to serve the city with joy. And it’s 
the same hope that concluded the 
1974 ICM Annual Report, laid 
out on its own page in a prayer: 
“If we are divided into separate 
camps,
Make us see at last
The folly of our division and be 
sorry for it,
So that we may no longer be 
content
to continue in this situation,
But think and act
In the light of your future, your 
promise
To make everything new,
No matter how.”
