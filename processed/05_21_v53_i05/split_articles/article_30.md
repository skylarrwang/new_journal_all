mandates. “The only thing that’ll 
work,” said Anika Singh Lemar, 
a clinical professor at Yale Law 
School who specializes in afford­
able housing, “is a much firmer 
stance from the state that the 
kinds of misbehavior and lack 
of action that we see at the local 
level are unacceptable and are 
undermining not just the lives of 
low-income people but the state’s 
economy.”

Opponents of even a watered-
down version of the Desegrega­
teCT bill have called it an affront 
to a way of life. “The global 
trend for three thousand years is 
increased density,” said Green­
wich State Representative Harry 
Arora (R-151), who’s become 
the face of the opposition. “We 
all come together. We build cit­
ies. The good news is Connecti­
cut is not that. If you think about 
Connecticut, we are different 
from many other states in our 
country. We do not have two big 
cities which have all the people 
and everything. Our large cities 
are about 5 percent of our pop­
ulation. We have a really good 
model, which has evolved over 
centuries, and there is no need to 
do a drastic surgery.” 

The Connecticut model has 
always been good at concealing 
the quiet desperation below its 
surface with loud politics. Not 
only its towns, but the state’s 
whole economy is now segre­
gated: between those in a reces­
sion and those not. Rent, and the 
inability to pay it, is a good mea­
sure of a dire economy, since peo­
ple choose to pay rent before any­
thing else—food included—when 
a choice is exacted upon them. 
At least 19 percent of renters in 
the state (over 226,000 people) 
were behind on rent in March 
of this year compared to 15 per­
cent nationally, Daniel Threet, a 
research analyst at the National 
Low-Income Housing Coalition 
(NLIHC), told me. Since Sep­
tember, when the state loosened 
its moratorium, the number of 
eviction lawsuits has risen rap­
idly: from 198 in September 2020 
to 882 in March 2021, according 
to data from the Connecticut Fair 
Housing Center. “These evictions 
do so much more down-stream 
damage than just losing the hous­
ing,” said Darren Pruslow, a 
supervising attorney at Connecti­
cut Veteran Legal Services. They 
tear at a person’s ability to live. 

In response, on top of the 
porous moratorium, the state has 
implemented a rental assistance 
program called UniteCT: an 
exclusively online portal where 
tenants and landlords can apply 
for a piece of $235 million in fed­
eral aid. The program amounts 
to callousness on a grand scale: a 
quarter of low-income people in 
the state don’t own a computer, 
according to Dalio Education’s 
2020 year-end report. UniteCT’s 
remedy has been to send a bus 
full of computers on a 6-days-a-
week tour of the state. Of course, 
to get to the bus, you need know 
it exists, you need to look online 
to find out where it will be on a 
specific day, you need to travel 
to it, most likely to another town 
or a far off part of the state, have 
all your paperwork in hand, have 
your taxes filed, and have time off 
from work to spare. The program 
has gotten 2,200 applications, as 
of April 7—1 percent of people 
who are already behind on rent. 
All the funds from the program 
have to be committed by Septem­
ber 30 of this year and paid out 
by December 30. The leftovers go 
back to the Treasury. 

When I asked George Cooper, 
the prominent economist and 
best-selling author of The Origin 
of Financial Crises, what he made 
of this M.C. Escher-like econ­
omy and its seemingly endless 
imagination for new obsceni­
ties, he told me that our territory 
was uncharted and the endgame 
unknown: “The COVID lock­
down has been the most bizarre 
period economically in human 
history.” Bizarre, yes. And cruel.
