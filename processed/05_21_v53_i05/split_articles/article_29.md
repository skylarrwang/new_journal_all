n Hartford this past Febru­
ary, at the headquarters of 
Aquiline Drones, Connecti­
cut Governor Ned Lamont spoke 
of the state’s buoyant economic 
mood. Businesses like Aquiline 
were starting to reverse the drift 
of the last decade, where compa­
nies threatened to leave the state 
whenever the legislature pro­
posed new taxes, and then did so 
anyway, regardless of whether the 
bills passed or died in committee. 
Then, like everyone everywhere, 
he talked about the real estate 
market. For years, Connecticut’s 
population had been flowing out, 
and now, finally, it was beginning 
to flow in. New Yorkers and Bos­
tonians were converting to the 
exurbs, spurred by COVID-19’s 
indefinite pause on cosmopoli­
tanism. More people, by choice or 
circumstance, were, in his words, 
“rediscovering the Connecticut 
lifestyle.” 


If in parts of Connecticut home 
prices were already astronomical, 
in recent months they’ve become 
solar: dialed in “hot,” “red-hot,” 
“white hot,” and “hot hot” in the 
breathless language of real estate. 
According 
to 
the 
Connecti­
cut Housing Finance Authority 
(CHFA), the median sales price of 
a home in Greenwich went from 
$935,000 to $1,371,250 in 2020. 
Westport values hit $1,267,500. 
New Canaan: $1,377,000. Prices 
in New Haven went up 18.9 
percent. Redding: 76.9 percent. 
Sharon: 141.6 percent. Sprague: 
930.8 percent. 


For twenty years, the CHFA 
has meticulously recorded each 
peak, valley, boom, and bust of 
the state’s home sales prices. The 
graph trends like a manic EKG: 
line sharply up, sharply down, 
flat, and repeat. The ride up has 
been good before, but the mar­
ket has never sustained this much 
bounce. Between February 2020 
and February 2021, the average 
home sale price in the state was up 
38.7 percent, by far a single-year 
record. An April article from the 
real estate site Rocket Homes asks 
the Hamletian question that these 
trends beg: “Rosy or Bleak?” How 
far can this kind of growth go 
before the market snaps? 


“These markets are driven 
by narratives,” Robert Shiller, 
Nobel Prize-winning economist, 
Sterling Professor of Econom­
ics at Yale, and the author, most 
recently, of Narrative Economics: 
How Stories Go Viral and Drive 
Major Economic Events, told me. 
One narrative says that the cur­
rent housing market—Connecti­
cut’s and the country’s, both up 
double-digit percentages in valu­
ation since last March—is impor­
tantly unlike the bubble that burst 
in 2008-9, that the panic over 
home prices and scarcity will 
eventually soothe itself: Urbanites 
simply realized Connecticut had 
a trove of houses, and they had 
the money to spend on them. The 
market’s bullishness has gotten 
many people in the state hooked 
on the hope of a renaissance. 


“The Great Recession…was really 
driven by the real estate market,” 
said Tammy Felestein, the pres­
ident-elect of the Connecticut 
Association of Realtors. But, she 
told me, “In this case, I think real 
estate is going to be a big part of 
what’s going to pull us out of the 
COVID devastation.” 


Housing supply in the state is 
caught in a net of interlocking 
market forces, tangled further by 
the bull market. Judging by Zil­
low’s monthly data on metro area 
housing inventories, the scram­
ble for Connecticut real estate 
really began in late September of 
last year. September was when 
the New Haven, Hartford, and 
Stamford metro areas went on 
a selling tear and, over the next 
six months, lost over 37 percent 
of their inventories. The shortage 
in supply juiced the base prices of 
whatever homes happened to be 
left on the market. 


To cope, buyers are market­
ing themselves to sellers like 
high school seniors before col­
lege admissions tribunals: writing 
personal letters to sellers to prove 
their worth, paying sums far 
above the asking price, and waiv­
ing inspections. At open houses, 
some prospective buyers don hos­
pital scrubs at the seller’s request, 
and the cars pile into the twenties 
and thirties. Seeing a dozen offers 
in a day on a single house—all 
cash, no questions—is common­
place now.    


Also commonplace is an appe­
tite for room, which has dramat­
ically changed the number and 
kind of building permits being 
issued by the state. In Septem­
ber, the state issued 649 residen­
tial building permits, according 
Connecticut’s 
Department 
of Economic and Community 
Development, and from there 
the number has steadily declined 
each month. In February, the last 
month of reported data, there 
were only 240. In 2020, just 
under 60 percent of those per­
mits had been issued for building 
multifamily units, the format that 
tends to be most affordable in the 
state. Between September 30 and 
February 28, that figure dipped 
below 43 percent. In January and 
February of this year, close to 70 
percent of permits issued were 
for single-family homes—the big 
ones endemic to the area. Buyers 
want to buy large and builders 
want to build large.


Big single-family homes are 
profitable 
for 
builders—more 
than enough to compensate for 
super-charged lumber and steel 
prices—and 
have 
never 
been 
more in demand. New econom­
ics also means sacrificing chic: 
Fewer homes have been built to 
the buyer’s specifications this past 
year than the norm, according 
to Jim Perras, CEO of the Home 
Builders & Remodelers Associa­
tion of Connecticut. People aren’t 
sculpting dream houses; they’re 
just buying. Even more at odds 
with prior expectation, Perras 
told me, has been the “increased 
interest in single-family built for 
rent, which has historically been 
a very small subset of the market.” 
Demand for buying and demand 
for rentals have almost always 
been inversely related: When one 
gets more intense, the other stag­
nates or shrinks. Not now. 


So there’s more high-end rental 
and single-family construction, 
less construction overall, more 
buying, lower inventory, higher 
prices, fewer sellers, more bids, 
less paperwork, more cash, fewer 
questions. Marcus Smith, Director 
of Research, Marketing and Out­
reach at the Connecticut Housing 
Finance Authority, a public-pri­
vate mortgage lender in the state 
prioritizing 
low-income 
bor­
rowers, said the organization has 
been closely monitoring “the use 
of cash to buy homes” that’s been 
squeezing out first-time buyers. 
Applying and being approved 
for a mortgage eats up months, 
and in that time, you’re liable to 
being scooped by someone who 
can pay up-front. Low-income 
buyers don’t stand a chance. The 
state’s now polarized, more than 
ever before, between a class that 
owns and a class that can’t even 
entertain the idea.   


That polarity happens to coin­
cide with a balanced budget in 
Hartford: The state is enjoy­
ing a 245 million dollar sur­
plus, sustained by new income 
tax revenue and federal aid. But 
the State Assembly’s legislative 
docket gives some indication 
of how unevenly that balance is 
being felt, especially at the local 
level where funding deficits are 
either desperate or nonexistent, 
nowhere in between. Five bills 
have been introduced since Jan­
uary to address the state’s byzan­
tine revenue collection and allo­
cation methods. One, SB 742, 
fully funds the state’s municipal 
revenue sharing account, which 
pools sales taxes and distributes 
them as grants to municipalities; 
in the last six years, the system has 
failed to deliver the hundreds of 
millions of dollars it pledged upon 
inception and let cities buckle 
under untenable debts. Another, 
SB 821, creates a child tax credit, 
removes the current fifteen mil­
lion dollar cap on estate taxes, 
and raises the property tax credit 
to four hundred dollars—poli­
cies meant to redistribute wealth 
without injecting liquidity into a 
market with persistent inflation 
fears. 


“BUYERS ARE 
MARKETING 
THEMSELVES 
TO SELLERS LIKE 
HIGH SCHOOL 
SENIORS BEFORE 
COLLEGE 
ADMISSIONS 
TRIBUNALS.”


Money is sitting in the state’s 
accounts. Now it’s a matter of 
moving and raising more steady 
streams of it. At the day-long 
public hearing on SB 821 back in 
mid-March, New Haven Mayor 
Justin Elicker took aim at one 
of the state’s more adamantine 
problems: “Our overemphasis on 
hyper-local property tax funding 
desperately needs reform, if we 
want to move our state forward 
and make it more equitable and 
a more just place.” Connecti­
cut is now the only state besides 
Rhode Island that has no formal 
county government, and, there­
fore, no way to tax real estate 
collectively across towns. Since 
the county system was abolished 
by the Democratic majority in 
1960—what Republicans predict­
ably called an attempt at “dictato­
rial rule”—only the wealthiest of 
the state’s 169 towns have been 
able to adequately provide basic 
services, like housing, educa­
tion, and infrastructure. The state 
ended up not with a tyranny of 
the legislature, but a dictatorship 
of the towns. Towns without a 
large property tax base, like New 
Haven, simply have not been able 
to raise the funds others have in 
spades. 


Now state Democrats are try­
ing to restore a collective mode of 
taxation, and Republicans are call­
ing that dictatorship, too. Debates 
on new taxes can range in tone 
from bedtime meditation to Civil 
War march, and lately both have 
been playing in the state. Two 
proposals in particular have had 
people waxing wroth: SB 171 and 
SB 172, drafted by the President 
Pro Tempore of the State Sen­
ate, New Haven’s Martin Looney 
(D-11), which would impose a 
state-wide property assessment 
and tax. The response from thou­
sands across the state was acrid, 
and broke party lines: peti­
tions sprung up in defense 
of “home rule,” against “big 
government dictating” and 
“usurping the power of ‘We 
the People.’” The debate 
is no longer strictly fac­
tional; it’s the old collision 
of court, country, and city, 
the sectional interests that 
divert attention from the 
source of social pain: greed. 


“In Connecticut, we have 169 
jealously self-protective munic­
ipal fiefdoms,” Looney told me, 
using the feudal analogy he often 
deploys when talking about the 
state. “There’s this strong tradi­
tion of local control here that’s 
politically toxic to disturb.” 


SB 
1024, 
“Desegrega­
teCT” bill, named after the activ­
ist group that’s been pushing for 
zoning reform in the state, dis­
turbed that same tradition. The 
bill 
proposes 
loosening 
local 
zoning restrictions to increase 
housing stock, naturally deflating 
the cost of buying and renting 
throughout the state, and allevi­
ating both its affordability crisis 
and its glaring racial inequities. 


“We’ve been focused on tran­
sit-oriented development. That’s 
a strategy that was just adopted 
in Massachusetts, nearly unani­
mously by the state legislature,” 
said Sara Bronin, the organiza­
tion’s founder. “Those reforms 
passed on a bipartisan basis. You 
look at the discourse here, and it’s 
just completely bizarre and totally 
puzzling.” 


DesegregateCT’s 
plans for transit-ori­
ented 
development, 
which, in the first iter­
ation of the bill, gave 
developers license to 
build multifamily housing within 
half a mile of a city’s main trans­
port hub without “minimum park­
ing requirements,” were stricken 
entirely in the revision that got 
out of committee, undercutting 
the bill’s intent. The “minimum 
parking requirements” that local 
zoning authorities now impose 
up and down the Gold Coast have 
made building affordable housing 
mathematically crazy: If develop­
ers are compelled by law to carve 
out three parking spots for every 
studio apartment they build, the 
apartment’s base price is bound to 
shoot up. The unspoken upshots 
of requirements like these are less 
diverse communities and more 
exclusive prosperity. 


Beyond parking, towns have 
a varied arsenal of caveats and 
conditions to pull from: deliber­
ate limitations on the extent of 
sewage systems, minimum acre­
ages for construction, excessive 
rounds of land-use applications 
and appeals. These have persisted 
even with legislative updates to 
decades-old affordable housing
