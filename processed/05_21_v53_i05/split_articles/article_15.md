Looking around my room, I 
find it is full of things I don’t need 
anymore: the shoes I recently 
bought online that are just a lit­
tle too tight, the stack of books 
I’ve read and probably will never 
pick-up again, the hair accesso­
ries that don’t mesh well with my 
new haircut. Some of these items 
certainly might be more useful to 
someone else. But where is the 
best place that they could go?


For many New Haven resi­
dents, the answer to this question 
is simple. The Buy Nothing New 
Haven group on Facebook, with 
over a thousand members, offers 
community members an opportu­
nity to give away items they no 
longer need. Members can also 
ask for items or services that they 
want—a plant-sitter, dog food, 
children’s clothes. The group, run 
by admins Rai Darwinsdottir and 
Catherine McGuinness, is a part 
of a global project, with chap­
ters across the United States and 
beyond.


At the core of the project is a 
push to prevent people from pur­
chasing new items or throwing 
away unwanted, but still func­
tional, ones. In a world where 
people tend to over-consume— 
with 
websites 
like 
Amazon 
whereone can purchase almost 
anything and expect it at their 
door in a few days—this group 
aims to prove that there are other, 
more sustainable ways to give and 
receive. And unlike thrift stores 
or online markets like Facebook 
Marketplace, no one involved in 
Buy Nothing makes any money. 
In the words of Alexa Carey, a 
Buy Nothing Global Team Mem­
ber, the gift-exchanging project 
is “revolutionary.”


The 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
however, 
has 
both 
limited 
Buy Nothing’s in-person gift 
exchanges and provoked a greater 
need for those gifts. “We really 
didn’t know how to respond,” 
Carey told me. She called the 
Buy Nothing group a “lifeline” 
for people struggling financially. 
“Because [Buy Nothing groups] 
are gift economies, they were 
essential to people,” she said.  
In a statement on the Buy Noth­
ing Project website from March 
2020, co-founders Liesl Clark and 
Rebecca Rockefeller required that 
all local groups adhere to the gov­
ernment guidelines in their area. 
When gift giving was not possi­
ble, they encouraged more “gifts 
of self,” like checking in on fellow 
group members, especially those 
who might live alone, over the 
phone or video chat. “We know
