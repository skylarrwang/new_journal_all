T
he first and only Har­
vard-Yale game I attended 
was 
among 
the 
most 
eventful ever played. In 2019, 
not only did Yale overcome Har­
vard’s double-digit lead to win by 
a touchdown in double overtime, 
but halftime was prolonged by 
hundreds of activists from both 
schools, who stormed the field in 
support of divestment from fos­
sil fuels. It was a dramatic intro­
duction to the debates, sit-ins, 
demands, and complexities that 
characterize the push-and-pull 
over how Yale makes money 
through investment—invest­
ments which were valued at 
$31.2 billion as of July 2020, 
according to Yale’s Invest­
ments Office. 

In early December, I attended 
an open meeting with Yale’s 
Advisory Committee on Inves­
tor Responsibility, where various 
student leaders spoke in support 
of divestment from fossil fuel 
companies. It wasn’t a conversa­
tion in any recognizable sense, 
and the underlying assumptions 
of the two sides (student-activists 
and committee members) were so 
different it could barely be called 
a debate—more like successive 
presentations. 

The 
students—
undergraduate organizers, mem­
bers of the Yale College Council, 
and graduate students—presented 
an argument focused on 
the urgency of the climate 
crisis and our moral obli­
gation to preserve ourselves 
and our planet. Members 
of the committee referred 
repeatedly to the limita­
tions on divestment outlined 
in The Ethical Investor, the 
almost 50-year-old text which 
defines how and when Yale 
should exercise its power as an 
investor to foment social change.

Later that week, I ordered a 
hard copy of The Ethical Inves­
tor from a small used bookstore 
in Connecticut. It arrived three 
weeks late, delayed in a shipping 
facility somewhere between New 
Jersey and Springfield, MA. With 
a view over the woods outside my 
bedroom window, I sat down to 
read it. It wasn’t easy. 

Written by John Simon, Charles 
Powers, and Jon Gunnemann, The 
Ethical Investor is relatively short, 
only 178 pages, but only the final 
seven of those pages actually lay 
out any policy recommenda­
tions for how a university should 
invest with social obligations in 
mind. The other 171 explore a 
wide-ranging defense of those 
recommendations, discussing the 
responsibilities of corporations 
and shareholders, the questions 
at stake for the university as an 
investor, and the legal justifi­
cation for a socially responsible 
investment policy.

The book was written in 1972 
to explore and define the univer­
sity’s role as a socially conscious 
investor. At the time, students 
on college campuses across the 
country were concerned with the 
complicity of higher education 
in the war in Vietnam and the 
Apartheid regime in South Africa. 
For administrators, on the other 
hand, Senator Joe McCarthy’s 
demagogic anti-communist cam­
paign was still in recent mem­
ory, and leaders feared wading 
into what they viewed as polit­
ical battles. I spoke over Zoom 
with one of the three co-au­
thors of The Ethical Investor, Jon 
Gunnemann DIV ’75, who had 
helped to write the text while at 
the Divinity School. Today, he’s 
a smiling, white-haired professor 
emeritus of social ethics at Emory. 

Gunnemann and his Divinity 
School classmate, Charles Powers, 
first became interested in ethical 
investing through their South 
Africa Studies Group, a collection 
of 
socially-conscious 
students 
who wanted to leverage Yale’s 
influence to contribute to the 
end of Apartheid. Although they 
doubted their individual ability 
to make a significant difference, 
they saw Yale—and the Corpo­
ration (Yale’s governing Board of 
Trustees)—as an institution capa­
ble of forcing change. 

Powers and Gunnemann wrote 
an article for the journal The 
Christian Century on pressuring 
the South African regime through 
socially 
responsible 
investing, 
hoping to catch the eye of J. 
Irwin Miller, a devout progres­
sive Christian and member of the 
Corporation. They were success­
ful—with some help from Yale’s 
Chaplain, 
who 
recommended 
the article to Miller. Powers and 
Gunnemann organized a meet­
ing 
with 
Kingman 
Brewster 
Jr., Yale’s president at the time; 
Miller; and the rest of the Cor­
poration at the Century Associa­
tion, which was then an all-male 
social club in New York City. 

John Simon LAW ’53, who had 
advocated for socially responsible 
investing in the nonprofit world, 
also joined the meeting, provid­
ing the legal expertise to back up 
the ideas Powers and Gunnemann 
had already been tackling. At 
that Century Association meet­
ing, Miller sat silent until Brew­
ster asked for his opinion. As 
Gunnemann recalls, Miller said, 
“I can’t see anything wrong with 
accountability.” And the ques­
tion became not “if” but “how” 
Yale would institute a policy for 
socially responsible investing.

The answer was a year-long 
seminar in the 1969-70 term at

the Law School, funded by a 
grant from the Ford Foundation. 
Students from the Law School, 
Divinity School, School of For­
estry, and College formed teams 
to explore the legal, economic, 
and ethical ramifications of vari­
ous possible policies. They exam­
ined wide-ranging case studies 
and drew on expert knowledge, 
seeking a set of policies that could 
address not only the issue of 
Apartheid but social harm in any 
form. The product of these hours 
of research, conversation, and 
debate was The Ethical Investor, 
written for Yale by members of 
the Yale community and adopted 
as University policy by vote of 
the Corporation in April of 1972. 
It was a powerful statement that 
Yale would not claim blindness or 
profess neutrality when its invest­
ments were perpetuating social 
harm.

The Ethical Investor differenti­
ates between negative injunctions 
(i.e., the avoidance of harm) and 
affirmative duties (the promo­
tion of good), stating “that all 
citizens, individual and institu­
tional, are equally subject to the 
negative injunction against social 
injury”—a principle they term as 
the “moral minimum.” The text 
expects that Yale’s Investments 
Office will generally seek maxi­
mum economic return in select­
ing where they invest the Uni­
versity’s resources. “Nonprofit 
factors” are those considerations, 
like moral culpability, which are 
not primarily concerned with 
profit-seeking. They come into 
play when a company is found 
to be committing “social injury,” 
such as the perpetuation of Apart­
heid or the pollution of air and 
water. In such cases, the text rec­
ommends that Yale pursue share­
holder actions—measures aimed 
at changing a company’s practices 
while still holding shares in it. 

The text instructs that divest­
ment should be the last resort, a 
step only taken if, (1) the exercise 
of shareholder rights are unlikely 
to effectively change the com­
pany’s behavior, (2) elimination 
of the socially injurious behav­
ior would make investment in 
the company unprofitable, or 
(3) the university expects to sell 
its shares before any shareholder 
action initiated by the univer­
sity could be finished. Activists 
at Yale have recently argued that 
the past practices of fossil fuel 
companies demonstrate that they 
are resolved in their resistance to 
change. According to the guide­
guides the full Board in direct­
ing the policies of the Invest­
ments Office. In mid-April, the 
CFFIP produced guidelines rec­
ommending that Yale divest from 
individual fossil fuel producers 
that most contribute to climate 
change and seem least likely to 
change their practices. The ACIR 
is now tasked with interpreting 
these policies, investigating the 
practices of individual fossil fuel 
companies, and making recom­
mendations for divestment to the 
Investments Office on a case-by-
case basis. The Investments Office 
currently estimates that Yale has 
$800 million invested in fossil 
fuels.

In his capacity as chair of both 
the ACIR and the CFFIP, Jona­
than Macey LAW ’82, Professor 
of Corporate Law, Corporate 
Finance, and Securities Law at 
Yale Law School, explained to 
me the importance of standards 
like The Ethical Investor in guid­
ing Yale’s investment policy. Yale 
is a fiduciary—meaning its trust­
ees are obligated to maximize 
returns. Because the University 
generally has a responsibility to 
maximize the profits of its invest­
ment, guidelines like The Ethical 
Investor and the CFFIP’s report 
are necessary for when the Uni­
versity takes non-profit factors 
into account. 

The authors of The Ethical 
Investor anticipate and preempt 
numerous legal objections to 
their investment policy. One such 
defense is the “Education-Climate 
Rationale,” a rebuttal which seems 
especially well-suited to the pres­
ent moment. The authors indi­
cate that there may be instances in 
which friction between students 
and university leadership grows 
so incurable that the function­
ing of the academic community 
lines of The Ethical Investor, this 
would make divestment justified.

The text also recommends 
that a “University Investments 
Council”—now 
Advisory 
Committee on Investor Respon­
sibility (ACIR)—be established 
to recommend policies to the 
trustees in response to requests 
from members of the Yale com­
munity. In the fall of 2020, Presi­
dent Peter Salovey established the 
parallel Committee on Fossil Fuel 
Investment Principles (CFFIP) to 
inform Yale’s fossil fuel invest­
ment policy specifically. Both 
the ACIR and the CFFIP advise 
the Corporation Committee on 
Investor Responsibility, which

is disrupted—stemming from “a 
weakening of the fabric of trust 
and confidence among members 
of the university population.” In 
these cases, the university would 
be justified in a measured accep­
tance of student demands. They 
compare any potential loss of 
profits to a business’s provision of 
“stock options, pension benefits, 
and trips to Florida”—expendi­
tures that ease conflict and con­
tribute to the long-term wellbe­
ing of an environment in which 
the organization’s mandate is 
better fulfilled. 

Nevertheless, while the book 
values a university that demon­
strates its receptivity to students’ 
social concerns, in seeking rem­
edies to those concerns, The 
Ethical Investor aims to balance 
moral purity and effectiveness—
how can the university actually 
encourage change with its invest­
ments, while recognizing that 
sometimes it is necessary to cut 
ties with a company altogether? 

In the end, the book empha­
sizes change from the inside (to 
an excessive degree, some might 
argue), accomplished while fossil 
fuel stock is still held by the Yales 
of the world—institutions that are 
aware of their impact and actively 
seeking to change the behavior 
of the corporations with which 
they are associated. Meanwhile, 
it does expect that the university 
as a shareholder will hold com­
panies accountable in an over­
sight capacity, relying on share­
holder action when necessary. 

Many student activists today, 
however, argue that the “mor­
ally pure” choice (divestment) is 
also the most effective and nec­
essary one—that Yale’s influence 
is so great and the climate crisis 
so grave that a decision to divest 
sets a needed precedent for others 
to follow.

In that seminar in which the 
first draft of The Ethical Inves­
tor was penned, students found 
that divestment depressed the 
stock price of the company in 
question for twenty-four hours, 
after which it bounced back as 
other (assumedly less responsi­
ble) investors took advantage of 
the lower price. And so the pol­
icy they developed positioned 
divestment as a last resort—one 
which evoked “the war movies 
in which the beleaguered infan­
try-man, having exhausted his 
ammunition, finally hurls his rifle 
at the advancing hordes.” It was 
the final step when there was no 
hope for changing a company’s 
practices through engagement 
with it. When I spoke with him 
in early April—before the release 
of the updated divestment guide­
lines—Gunnemann said he had 
supported divestment from fos­
sil fuels for the past three years. 
And with the CFFIP report, it 
seems that Yale is adopting pol­
icies that align more closely with 
Gunnemann’s judgment and the 
consensus among numerous stu­
dent activists. 

As 
my 
conversation 
Gunnemann wrapped up, he 
emphasized one thing he learned 
when writing The Ethical Inves­
tor: “How you frame an issue 
becomes really decisive… and, 
of course, the other big question 
[is], who has the power to frame 
issues?” He was referring specif­
ically to fossil fuel companies, 
which he feels have exerted dis­
proportionate influence on dis­
cussions of the environment. My 
impression was that students con­
veyed a similar sentiment con­
cerning the fossil fuel debate at 
Yale—that the very way in which 
the conversation is framed limits 
their ability to engage.
