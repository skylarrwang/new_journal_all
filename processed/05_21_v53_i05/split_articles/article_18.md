Community Services. 

The roles of the two floors will 
be intertwined. While the first 
floor is designed to be welcom­
ing—and to fulfill basic needs 
outside of mealtimes—the sec­
ond will connect clients with a 
web of higher-level services that 
otherwise are not centralized in 
any one place in New Haven. 

By creating an initial space that 
is casual, there is greater incen­
tive—or, rather, fewer obsta­
cles—to engage with services 
upstairs. The combination of 
the two floors aims to weaken 
deterrents to seeking help, from 
inconvenience factors—such as 
having to locate services individ­
ually—to stigma against home­
lessness, mental health issues, and 
sex work.  

James Adu is a program man­
ager for Connecticut Mental 
Health Center who helps with 
the street psychiatry team as well 
as street outreach services. Mem­
bers of the street psychiatry team 
will be hosted on DESK’s sec­
ond floor on State Street. From a 
mental health perspective, simply 
having a confidential space will 
help mental health counsellors 
help clients, Adu says. On top of 
privacy, a welcoming first floor— 
where clients are inclined to stay 
awhile—will create an environ­
ment that might help counsellors 
develop new connections casu­
ally.

“Our role is just being there, 
engaging with the individuals 
and not forcing our services on 
people,” said Adu. “I think we 
can provide linkages, so it’s not 
that mental health is necessarily 
the be-all and end-all. It’s just 
‘Oh, okay. Well, you’ve identi­
fied these [issues]. We can help 
you with that. But if you’re not 
ready, that’s fine too.’ We can still 
engage. We can still meet down­
stairs, we can sit, have a coffee 
where you see your peers.”

Executive Director Steve Wer­
lin is overseeing much of the new 
center’s opening. He talked to me 
over Zoom from the third floor of 
the State Street building—though 
we later met at DESK, where we 
had one of those clumsy comput­
er-screen-to-reality moments of 
recognition. Planning began in 
2018, but it wasn’t until Decem­
ber of 2020 that the building 
could be purchased, thanks to 
pandemic-induced 
lower 
real 
estate prices.

“We started thinking about, 
well, if we were designing some­
thing from scratch what would 
it look like?” said Werlin of the 
brainstorm phase. “It would be 
street level. It would be highly 
visible, 
forward-facing, 
with 
windows easily visible if you’re 
walking down the street, easy to 
find, close to the Green—meeting 
people where they are both liter­
ally in terms of location, as well as 
physically in terms of everyone’s 
accessibility.”

While few linger at Center 
Church, it is the main activity in 
the new location. Most ask for no 
more than a cup of coffee before 
they sit down and start sipping 
slowly. One client just asks if it 
would be possible for him to get 
water, then more water, then 
three more refills. He also asks for 
help setting up an email account. 
He tells me he has been home­
less for a year and four months, 
but he has slept in a hotel with 
designated rooms converted into 
two-person shelter spaces during 
the pandemic. It was his first time 
visiting DESK’s new space. 

“I like this place,” he said, look­
ing past my head at the freshly 
painted walls behind me. “I don’t 
have to worry about a room­
mate here. It’s nice because with 
a roommate, maybe we don’t get 
along, or they’re coming in and 
out, or they’re using.”

Columbus 
House, 
a 
New 
Haven shelter, will have outreach 
workers connect with clients on 
DESK’s first floor. Many shel­
ters, Columbus House included, 
have moved clients into hotel 
rooms due to the incompatibil­
ity between their usual congre­
gate living arrangements and 
current public health demands. 
But during the day, clients must 
clear from hotels for them to be 
cleaned, forcing them to seek 
help elsewhere. Helpful resources, 
however, are not centralized 
cohesively in shelters, let alone 
hotels, let alone New Haven. 

One clear-eyed client spoke to 
me with great enthusiasm about 
DESK’s new space. He was look­
ing forward to a second floor that 
could provide services so close to 
a first floor where he could hang 
out. He then asked me if there 
might also be a place to sleep. I 
had to tell him no.

While the drop-in center’s 
decor is friendly, the center is also 
welcoming at a functional level. 
The center ensures there are as 
few requirements as possible for 
those who come to DESK; this 
includes a policy of not taking 
down names of clients who visit 
the center and not limiting ser­
vices based on apparent sobriety.

With a mirror on the wall to 
the right of my station, I could 
see the area behind me by slightly 
turning my head. Its purpose is 
to reflect the bathroom door. 
Although DESK is not a safe 
injection site or a medical facility 
qualified to monitor substance use 
on-site, there are procedures in 
place to respond to, in the words 
of Werlin, “the realities on the 
ground.” Prior to clients’ arrival, 
both my supervisor and a hand­
out sheet instruct me to knock on 
the bathroom door if a client is 
inside for more than three min­
utes, at which point, if there is 
no response, I should use a code 
word to ask a staff member to call 
an ambulance. There is Naloxone 
behind the snack table, should a 
client become unresponsive. 

According to Werlin, it is dif­
ficult to say whether DESK’s 
drop-in 
center 
embodies 
an 
“ideal” model for providing ser­
vices to people experiencing 
homelessness—because DESK is a 
small organization, because there 
aren’t enough workers conduct­
ing street outreach, because of 
the fluidity of the lives of those 
experiencing homelessness, and 
because of the systemic nature of 
homelessness in America.

“I think it’s a piece of the 
puzzle,” said Adu. “It definitely 
doesn’t solve the entire network, 
the centralization of homeless 
services, but it’s a start. And it’s a 
very important start.”
