life-changing.”) Still, r/ShowerO­
range is active today; it boasts over 
sixty-nine thousand members. The 
trend has had a resurgence on Tik­
Tok as well. Over eighty-seven 
thousand people have viewed the 
hashtag “#orangeinshower.”

On the Zoom call, Blood 
Orange maintained that YSOS had 
been around since 1921. In fact, the 
Inner Citrus had prepared a whole 
slideshow presentation about their 
society’s incredible history. Their 
Latin motto is “AVRANCIA IN 
BALNEIS CERTATIM MAND­
VCAMVS,” which Kumquat help­
fully translated as, “We eat oranges 
in the shower with zest.” YSOS 
was founded, according to this 
presentation, by three Yale under­
graduates: “Bill Gates, on the left, 
Clifford Buchanan, in the cen­
ter, and Jeb Bush, on the right,” 
Blood Orange said, displaying a 
photograph that, I later discov­
ered, is one of the top results if 
you search “1920s fashion men” on 
Google Images. They traced their 
apocryphal history through the 
decades: At first, YSOS had a tomb 
on Orange Street. (I asked where 
the tomb was, exactly. “That’s 
classified,” Kumquat said.) War­
ren G. Harding banned shower 
oranges in 1922, apparently out 
of sheer malice toward what Tan­
gerine called their “daring count­
er-culture.” The ban forced YSOS 
underground. After the 1928 Flor­
ida hurricane wiped out most of 
the state’s orange groves, YSOS 
members turned in desperation to 
shower apples, marking “the low­
est point in shower orange his­
tory,” according to Clementine. 
During the free love movement of 
the Sixties, shower oranges became 
a popular group activity at Yale, 
which again attracted the ire of the 
authorities. Yale’s president at the 
time, Kingman Brewster Jr., con­
demned shower oranges. “YSOS 
disbanded and gave up its tomb,” 
said Jaffa Orange. 

There was then, according to 
this fantastic tale, a period of dor­
mancy from the nineteen-sixties 
onward. YSOS reassembled (or 
assembled, one suspects, for the 
first time) in 2018, but it was a 
small, fragile, secret group. When 
the pandemic interrupted their 
initiation process, the young soci­
ety was in danger of dying for lack 
of new initiates. The members of 
YSOS had to do something if they 
wanted to keep their group alive.

So they went public. In early 
March, YSOS created the Insta­
gram 
account 
“shower.orange.
yale.” They post various bits of 
shower orange content; a graphic 
from March 17 asks, in orange text 
on a blue background, “Where 
is your favorite place to eat an 
orange?” Swiping through the post 
reveals a few options (“Trumbull 
Shower? Saybrook Shower? Pauli 
Murray Shower? Payne Whit­
ney Shower?”) along with a help­
ful photo of each. So far they’ve 
accrued 529 followers.

Entering the public sphere has 
had its downsides. While the Inner 
Citrus have seen plenty of posi­
tive feedback on their Instagram 
account, they’ve also received 
lewd direct messages, apparently 
provoked by the erotic overtones 
some detect in the shower orange. 
Even worse, “We also have people 
coming at us saying things like, 
‘Can I eat a charcuterie board in 
the shower?’” Clementine said. 
“The answer is obviously no.”

Despite their bullies, YSOS 
believes in welcoming others. “At 
a place that is already dripping wet 
with pretentiousness,” Kumquat 
said, referring to Yale, “we try to 
accept any and all followers who 
resonate with our mission.”

Shower oranges continued to 
perplex me—I couldn’t wrap my 
head around the astonishing zeal 
of their admirers. The Inner Cit­
rus, of course, had plenty of expla­
nations. 

Tangerine said the smell makes 
a shower orange special. “Where 
does the smell come most intensely 
to us?” Tangerine asked. “In a very 
warm and humid environment. 
And the most handy would be the 
shower.” (To my disappointment, 
you’ll recall, I found the smell of 
a shower orange no more intense 
than a normal orange.)

“It’s helped me tune into my 
spirituality,” Jaffa Orange said.

“I would argue that partaking 
in a shower orange is actually an 
act of political protest,” Kumquat 
said. “We’re all naked and enjoy­
ing the juice running down our 
bodies—it’s a very humanizing act, 
and therefore is inherently demo­
cratic.”

Clementine decided a poem 
would best express their love for 
shower oranges: “Taking a shower 
with citrus / the juice running 
orange and viscous / I chomp and I 
gnash / till the fruit is a mash / for I 
only have God as my witness.”

“It’s a very old poem,” Clemen­
tine said.


A week later, I tried again with 
a Cara Cara orange—pink, heavy, 
sweet, cold. I’m not saying I saw 
the light. And maybe all the praise 
of the Inner Citrus had clouded 
my judgement. But, I admit, it was 
a pretty phenomenal orange. One 
of my better showers, too.
