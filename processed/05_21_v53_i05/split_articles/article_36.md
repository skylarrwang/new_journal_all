The Inner Citrus made two 
demands. One: I must not inquire 
into their identities. They would 
not reveal those identities, and I 
would not pry. Two: I must par­
take in a shower orange. That 
much, at least, I had expected.

So one evening while my family 
watched TV downstairs, I brought 
a plump navel orange into the 
shower. It felt odd to have it in 
there with me, sort of like being 
trapped in a room with a strange, 
harmless animal. Eventually I 
began to peel the orange. Its skin 
was surprisingly tough. The zest 
caught under my fingernails; the 
juice and pulp leaked down my 
arms; the peel came off in small, 
irregular chunks. Conveniently—
and this is perhaps the most per­
suasive argument voiced by fans 
of the shower orange—the water 
washed all the mess away. I made 
a little pile of peel chunks on a 
shelf in my shower. Then I ate the 
orange. 

It tasted like a standard super­
market 
orange, 
somewhere 
between fine and good. It smelled 
nice, but not noticeably nicer 
than an orange does outside of 
the shower. The shower felt like a 
shower: hot, pleasant. Perhaps the 
twin novelties of eating an orange 
in an unfamiliar place and per­
forming an unfamiliar act in the 
shower made me more mindful 
of each element—that is, perhaps I 
enjoyed both the shower and the 
orange slightly more than I would 
have if I’d experienced them sep­
arately—but I wouldn’t call it lib­
erating, or a sensual reverie, or 
a moment of spiritual transcen­
dence.

The members of the Yale Shower 
Orange Society would. YSOS is 
a secret group of shower orange 
enthusiasts who have vowed to 
“spread the zested message of the 
blessed shower orange,” as they 
assonantly describe their mission. 
I planned to interview their senior 
members—the “Inner Citrus,” as 
they call themselves—later that 
night.  

So I emerged from the shower, 
brought my orange debris to the 
trash, clothed myself, and opened 
the Zoom meeting. On the call 
was Kumquat, a lonely-looking 
orange with human eyes and a 
human mouth floating in front of 
an orange grove. Kumquat told 
me that others would soon arrive. 
Soon, they did. Blood Orange, 
Jaffa Orange, Valencia Orange, 
Clementine, and Tangerine all 
joined Kumquat. Most of them 
had identical setups: the same dig­
ital orange-head in front of a dig­
ital orange grove. Blood Orange 
and Valencia Orange had phoned 
in together. Their camera was off, 
and in lieu of a profile picture their 
square displayed an edited version 
of Magritte’s “The Son of Man.” 
I’m sure you can guess what the 
green apple had been replaced 
with.

The subreddit r/ShowerOrange 
was created in April 2015, but 
the trend didn’t blow up on Red­
dit until the next year. A shower 
orange, in case it isn’t clear yet, is 
nothing more than an orange you 
eat in the shower. Members of r/
ShowerOrange have described eat­
ing a shower orange as “borderline 
euphoric,” “a religious experience,” 
“amazingly blissful,” and gener­
ally transcendent. By the early 
months of 2017, publications like 
Men’s Health, Pure Wow, Vice, and 
even NPR had published online 
articles about the trend. (NPR’s 
testers concluded that eating a 
shower orange was nice, but “not
