The pandemic forced caregiving roles onto many students. 
Supporting them can help us reimagine Yale.
“It was back to normal, but 
not for me.”
adaptations like these—almost. 
After returning home, Margaret 
spent the next twenty-two hours 
with her family in their can­
dle-lit living room waiting for 
the power to return. Her father’s 
tremors, most of the time local­
ized in his hands, were spreading 
that night, occasionally reaching 
his face. He was getting stressed. 
Which would lead to Margaret’s 
mother getting stressed. Which 
would lead to Margaret’s sister 
getting stressed. Which, in this 
deeply-felt 
interdependence, 
would lead to Margaret getting 
stressed. She tried to remain 
calm, but she knew that when the 
power returned there would be 
a frantic rush to catch up on her 
work, and on her father’s. She’d 
be helping him send emails, type, 
and sort papers, like she’d been 
doing for the past eight  months 
as his Parkinson’s Disease pro­
gressed and made fine motor 
skills difficult. 
Margaret’s parents are in their 
late 70s, and throughout high 
school she had balanced aca­
demic obligations with helping 
them apply for Social Security 
benefits and working part-time 
to cover medical bills. But when 
she returned home after the clos­
ing of Yale’s campus in March 
2020, she learned that her father 
had been diagnosed with Parkin­
son’s Disease and took on new 
responsibilities to support him. In 
the spring semester, the college’s 
switch to Pass/Fail grading helped 
her manage some of the burden 
of trying to get a handle on the 
initial diagnosis. But by the time 
Yale returned to A-F classes in 
the fall, her dad’s symptoms had 
progressed, making it difficult 
for him to type and sometimes 
to speak. As Margaret put it, “It 
was back to normal, but not for 
me.” She found herself helping 
her father with work, driving 
him to and from offices, prepar­
ing food, making sure he was tak­
ing his medications, scheduling 
doctor’s appointments, keeping a 
watchful eye on the progression 
of his symptoms, and working a 
restaurant job to support her fam­
ily’s income, all while keeping up 
with the demands of extracurric­
ulars and classes—demands like 
her history course’s weekly paper, 
which, by the time the power 
returned the day after the storm, 
was due in a few hours. She knew 
that she wouldn’t have enough 
time to help her dad and com­
plete the assignment. Her family 
depends on her father’s income 
for stability, so there wasn’t much 
of a choice to make.
In testimony to the Senate Spe­
cial Committee on Aging, care­
giving advocate and former First 
Lady Rossalyn Carter said, “There 
are only four kinds of people in 
the world: those who have been 
caregivers, those who are cur­
rently caregivers, those who will 
be caregivers, and those who 
need caregiving.” The corona­
virus pandemic has brought the 
marginalized work of caregiving, 
and our collective dependence 
on caregivers—in nursing homes, 
schools and hospitals, within 
families and communities—into 
greater public awareness. Yet 
students who serve as family 
caregivers continue to be under­
served by their academic institu­
tions, according to the Institute 
for Women’s Policy Research. 
“Yale is not the world.”
For 
a 
moment, 
Margaret’s* 
room shuddered in flickering, 
yellow light, then—darkness. The 
power in her small New England 
town went out with the crackle 
of 
an 
October 
thunderstorm. 
Without Internet access at home, 
she hopped into her sister’s small 
brown Volkswagen, drove twenty 
minutes down the road into the 
next town, and parked on the 
side of the road. She logged onto 
her French class as rain drummed 
against the roof of her car. In the 
past year, Margaret, a sophomore 
at Yale, had gotten used to making 
Embedded in relationships span­
ning geographical and gener­
ational 
communities, 
student 
caregivers defy many colleges’ 
aspirational models of campus as 
a bubble devoted solely to intel­
lectual pursuits among 18-22 year 
olds. These relationships remind 
students like Margaret of what 
one might forget while in the 
campus bubble: “Yale is not the 
world.” Responding to the chal­
lenges faced by student caregivers 
is not only crucial for supporting 
a growing segment of college 
students, but also for creating a 
higher education culture which 
recognizes all students as full peo­
ple with needs, responsibilities 
and relations that reach beyond 
the scope of a college campus. 
“Professors would say, ‘Peo­
ple who perform best are peo­
ple who go to office hours reg­
ularly,’” recalled Danielle, a Yale 
senior who worked 19 hours a 
week throughout her four years 
to support her family and pay 
her student income contribution 
(the amount that the university 
expects students on financial aid 
to contribute to their education). 
She remembered thinking with 
frustration, “Well, I just don’t 
have that time during the day. It’s 
not that I don’t care.” Struggling 
in her sophomore year General 
Chemistry course, she desperately 
needed to attend a review session 
for the midterm, but they were 
only offered at 3 p.m. each day 
of the week—precisely during 
her work hours at an off-cam­
pus childcare center. “No matter 
what, I just lose,” she said, sigh­
ing. “Professors don’t realize that 
a lot of students are unfortunately 
not just full time students—we 
don’t actually just sit there all day 
and get to study.”
As Margaret attended classes 
from home in the spring and fall 
of 2020, she felt like Yale expected 
being a student to be her sole pri­
ority. But in reality, she was a sis­
ter, daughter, caregiver, income 
contributor, and more. She woke 
up early to take timed midterms 
before her familial responsibilities 
started, and she stayed up late to 
do homework after everyone had 
gone to bed. “In hindsight,” she 
reflects, “I know I wasn’t doing 
my best work.” She watched 
lectures in 15-minute chunks in 
between preparing meals, and 
she avoided synchronous classes, 
knowing that, “at any moment, 
someone could knock on my 
door and ask for my help with 
something—and I would [help 
them].” It would be a mistake to 
presume that these responsibili­
ties end when student caregivers 
leave home.  Danielle spent the 
summer after freshman year in 
Paris, thousands of miles from her 
family in Indiana, but she con­
tinued sending money back to 
her family. She still felt tethered 
to her caregiving responsibili­
ties: “Half of my brain was Yale 
things, and then the other half 
was ‘My parents can’t afford the 
electric bill this month, and I’m in
