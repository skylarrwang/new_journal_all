I
t’s April 7, 2020, and I am 
sitting in a tree in a park in 
what feels like the eye of the 
pandemic. The air is chilly and 
I can smell yesterday’s linger­
ing rain, the only sign of spring 
beginning to creep out from 
hiding. New York City has just 
reached 
over 
three 
thousand 
deaths from COVID-19. Each 
day I have watched the num­
bers soar upwards on my phone 
and either resisted or succumbed 
to the impulse to call everyone 
I love and ensure that they are 
O.K. But now it is different and 
worse: today NYC COVID-19 
deaths have surpassed the number 
of people who died on September 
11, 2001—2,977. Anyone born 
before those attacks felt we had 
now descended to an unknown, 
unimaginably horrible circle of 
hell. 

My tree sits at the top of a hill 
in Morningside Park, by 114th 
Street. One of the highest in Man­
hattan, this hill is my sentry point: 
a height from which I can keep 
track of everything that passes 
below. In front of me the ground 
falls away into Harlem, East Har­
lem, the East River, and Queens. 
At my back is the Morningside 
branch of Mount Sinai Hospital. I 
know it is there, though I do not 
turn to look, because I grew up 
three blocks away. I also know 
because the wail of sirens drowns 
out the Rolling Stones’ “Emo­
tional Rescue” playing in my 
headphones. Many think of the 
early pandemic period as silent, 
the moment the world went 
quiet. New York did not go quiet. 
It was loud and shrill, filled with 
the ringing sirens that signalled 
another person so ill that they had 
reached their last resort. No one 
wanted to be in the infectious 
miasma of the hospital unless it 
was their only option. In this new 
aural landscape, I began to read, 
not to fill the silence, but to shut 
out the noise. 

Over the next two months I 
would read twenty-nine books 
on this hill—roughly three and 
a half books a week. My close 
friend worked every night as 
an EMT, saving lives; I stayed 
at home reading. Going out in 
the world might have endan­
gered others. Why I continued to 
read, even after the first burst, is 
more complicated. Books would 
give me the tools to reconstruct 
myself, clothed in the opportu­
nity of escape. 

What is fiction for? This ques­
tion has been either written about 
or ignored by generations of 
writers and readers, and it forms 
the basis of people’s confusion 
at why I am an English major. 
Fiction, many have argued, does 
not serve a greater purpose. But 
this assertion misses the point: 
whether it has a ‘purpose’ or not, 
it certainly has effects. 

I have many friends for whom 
reading fiction is escapism. It’s a 
way of evading the problems that 
exist in your world and entering 
another one where you don’t have 
to deal with the complications 
of being “you.” This, I think, is 
why kiosks in airports sell pot­
boilers and romance novels. If 
you’re escaping daily life with a 
vacation, you want your reading 
to help you. In New York City 
in April 2020, escapism seemed 
understandable. But is escapism 
always frivolous? 

I began with a desire to leave, 
go anywhere, since my life last 
spring was an unusually self-con­
tained narrative. It was a story of 
isolation that did not spill over 
into others but remained within 
the structure it could itself pro­
duce—and under the circum­
stances it produced a soliloquy. 
Through reading, I could break 
through that structure and engage 
with a multitude of narratives 
that interrogated and enriched 
my own. As I read, my soliloquy 
became a dialogue. Tayeb Salih 
and Zadie Smith, generations 
apart, exchanged diverse immi­
grant experiences. Sam Shep­
ard and James Baldwin sparred 
cross-country over the enduring 
power of past loves. By leaving 
my own world behind I tumbled 
into several others. 

Virginia Woolf writes of this 
fall into another world, this 
merging of the self and the other. 
In a letter to her friend Ethel 
Smyth, Woolf explains that the 
novel “splits us into two parts as 
we read.” Through reading, we 
experience “complete elimina­
tion of the ego” and also “per­
petual union” with the mind of 
another. Woolf’s language is a bit 
grandiose—I’m not sure if many 
readers can lay claim to a “com­
plete elimination” or “perpetual 
union.” Yet the attempt is worth 
a shot. Like Woolf, I have found 
that to read a book as deeply as 
I can, I must nearly abandon 
myself on the first page. I must
