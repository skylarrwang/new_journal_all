EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Instagram chile oil isn’t too 
spicy, Instagram birria is veg­
etarian, and Instagram paletas 
don’t melt. On the social media 
accounts of chefs, restaurants, 
and food magazines, food exists 
in a hyper-distilled form—smell-
less, taste-less, free, and in quan­
tities greater than any person 
could ever eat at once. It can be 
consumed visually over and over 
again, with captions that evoke 
taste by flagrantly overusing 
adjectives: A scallion dressing is 
“scalliony,” pudding is “milky,” 
bread is “pillowy.” Bizarre com­
binations don’t sound too bad 
at all: a dense, floaty, choco­
latey, cardamom-inflected stew. 
A snacky tangle of sugar-dusted 
cabbage and sweet-sour yogurt. 
The best food pictures are messy 
in a way that suggests abun­
dance: overflowing sandwiches 
or tall scoops of ice cream drip­


ping a little down the cone, but 
not enough to make your fingers 
sticky. You can eat breakfast and 
lunch and dinner from five dif­
ferent restaurants, because you 
never get full when you’re eating 
on Instagram. Nonetheless, even 
in pictures, food carries a heavy 
cultural weight. The things we 
eat can’t be separated from their 
history and politics, even when 
stripped of their physical form.


businesses. “Instagram and social 
media has been a very demo­
cratic place for chefs, who don’t 
have investors, to have a voice,” 
she said. Not everyone can buy 
a multi-million dollar restaurant 
space, but a camera and some 
good lighting are pretty easy to 
come by, and new restaurants 
can advertise on social media for 
a fraction of the cost of a TV spot. 
Cheng also discussed additional 
pressures placed on chefs of color, 
including the implicit assump­
tion that their food will be cheap, 
or will recreate some kind of 
photo-friendly street food expe­
rience. “People say their food 
should be two dollars,” she said. 
“White chefs don’t get docked 
for experimentation.” 
For better or worse, social 
media imposes a new kind of 
structure. Almost any food that 
makes it to the platform is pal­
atable to the eyes, which gener­
ally means it’s been aesthetically 
flattened, placed in front of an art 
wall or held up against a skyline. 
In Restaurant Business’s 2020 arti­
cle “Easing Into Ethnic Eating,” a 
guide for “getting customers on 
board with emerging cuisines,” 
the first tip is to make the food 
“visually appealing.” The author 
quotes the owner of a Balkan 
restaurant who has learned to 
take a “visual-first” approach, 
plating dishes alongside color­
ful sides and posting pictures on 
Instagram. “The city has a lot of 
traditional mom-and-pop Balkan 
restaurants, but I wanted to give 
the food a contemporary spin—
make it inviting while keep­
ing the integrity of the dishes,” 
Loryn Nalic told the publication. 
Her St. Louis restaurant, Balkan 
Treat Box, regularly posts pic­
tures of their flatbreads on beau­
tiful wooden boards, and has an 
astounding fourteen thousand 
followers. 
While the internet has no 
shortage of cappuccino pictures, 
most online food content features 
what’s traditionally called ethnic 
food in the United States—food 
that’s often cooked by immi­
grants and their children. An 
informal survey by Chef’s Pen­
cil in February showed that the 
top food hashtag on Instagram 
is #JapaneseFood, followed by 
#ItalianFood, with #IndianFood, 
#KoreanFood, and #Thaifood 
coming in third, fourth, and fifth. 
The prevalence of ethnic food on 
Instagram implies a need to reas­
sure white American customers 
that something that sounds dif­
ferent can still be delicious, a sort 
of visual verification of the unfa­
miliar.
In addition to her work, 
Cheng runs her own Instagram, 
@achg.kitchen, which has a loyal 
following of Yale students and 
food professionals. Although she 
posted stand-alone pictures of 
food fairly frequently before the 
pandemic, on March 18, 2020, 
she debuted a new kind of post, 
focused on food history and crit­
ical analysis. The first slide is a 
picture of crispy, roasted okra 
next to two lemon slices. Four 
screenshots of her Notes app 
follow, which taught me that 
okra has been traced as far back 
as twelfth century Ethiopia and 
was brought to the Americas 
by enslaved people. In the post, 
Cheng explains how fat politics 
and race intersect in traditional 
Southern cooking, which often 
incorporates okra. As she points 
out, the “‘health-oriented’ food 
shaming” associated with South­
ern food like fried chicken is 
rarely applied to food from other 
cuisines with similar nutritional 
content, such as Eggplant Par­
mesan. Other posts reckon with 
the history of takeout and the 
presence of anti-Blackness in 
Asian immigrant-owned restau­
rants, rice cultivation and cli­
mate change, and “the mid-2000s 
bacon obsession.” By putting 
the description front and center 
instead of relegating it to a cap­
tion or the comments, Cheng 
makes it clear that food is insep­
arable from its roots, connota­
tions, history, and production. 
What we actually eat is layered 
behind pictures and captions. “A 
huge proportion of Americans 
are related to the food industry,” 
she said. “And we all eat.” 
The scoops of edible cookie 
dough on my feed were scooped 
by someone, and the sugarcane 
for the sugar inside it was also 
harvested by someone, and that 
sugarcane plant was brought 
from Southeast Asia to China to 
Portugal and then to Brazil and 
finally Louisiana, where indig­
enous and African people were 
enslaved in order to produce the 
“white gold” that, years later, 
ended up inside the edible cookie 
dough that never goes bad on 
Instagram.
