L
iberia is the land of my 
birth. Tiny, with a popu­
lation of about five million 
people, it was the first African 
nation to gain political indepen­
dence. In Africa, some prefer to 
call it “small America,” others 
“the America in Africa.” Why? 
Because Liberia was founded by 
Black people from America, many 
of whom were formerly enslaved. 
Indeed, there couldn’t be better 
monikers for a country whose 
first ten presidents were born on 
American soil. But to me, these 
labels are meaningless sounds, 
mere rhetoric meant to invoke 
good feelings in a people lan­
guishing in poverty’s depths. The 
difference between the two coun­
tries couldn’t be any wider. My 
country ranks in the pantheon of 
the world’s poorest nations, while 
America is the world’s biggest 
economy. Yet nowhere is the dif­
ference between both countries 
more apparent than in their con­
ception of individualism.   

Growing up in Liberia, every 
day was the same: clear and 
sunny, beaming with the fresh 
warmth of a hot summer day. In 
the scourging heat, I would play 
soccer with friends, while adults 
occupied the kitchens, preparing 
the day’s only meal. There were 
families that would go weeks 
on end without food. That was 
the group to which my family 
belonged. 

But when it was dusk—the sun 
sliding into solemn repose, the 
moon and stars beginning their 
nocturnal 
course—all 
families 
gathered. As the night unfolded, 
I would, like other kids, make 
my way to the open space where 
neighbors 
congregated. 
Some 
nights were chilly, with the thick 
and dry wind, larded with the 
smell of tropical orchids in bloom, 
beating against our fragile, often 
malnourished faces. When every­
one had settled in a spot, the 
adults would begin telling stories. 
Listening to stories was a daily 
chore. One story I frequently 
heard throughout my younger 
life was about “the land of the 
free.” That this phrase squirmed 
its way to my small slummy 
hometown, into the ears and onto 
the tongues of men, women and 
children whose lives had been 
arrested by poverty is still befud­
dling. I became familiar with the 
phrase before I knew the coun­
try’s name. When the adults told 
the story, some pronounced it 
“Ar-marica,” or others, “Air-mer­
ica.” But I didn’t care about the 
correct 
name 
or 
pronuncia­
tion. Nor was I interested in the 
authenticity of the story, for I 
knew that the adults who narrated 
it had never been on a plane, let 
alone traveled to America.  

As the adults would explain, 
America was a country of enor­
mous wealth. There were no 
haves and have-nots. It was the 
best in everything, including 
education, health, infrastructure. 
Sometimes, an adult would mut­
ter that if there was an asphalt road 
connecting Africa to America, he 
would walk to enter America. 
That, they said, was better than 
wallowing in abject poverty. And 
so, I came to believe that America

was the land of milk and honey.  

I was also told that America was 
the best place for the individual to 
rise out of mediocrity. Human 
flourishing, through individual 
self-actualization, was the modus 
operandi. One could do what­
ever, whenever and however she 
desired. Everything the individ­
ual wanted was readily available, 
so long as she could work at it. 
It seemed to me that Ameri­
can society aided and uplifted its 
people towards the realization of 
their goals. This bit of the story 
glued me to those nightly con­
versations. It was how I came to 
understand American individual­
ism, long before I could dream of 
coming to America.   

Individualism 
is 
America’s 
mantra, the crux of the Ameri­
can dream and American life. The 
country was founded on the cult 
of the individual, the belief that 
the country could only thrive 
when the individual is left to her­
self, and that she should engage 
in acts which maximize her hap­
piness and satisfaction. In this 
way, the individual attains a sense 
of self and asserts her true iden­
tity through the exercise of her 
freedom. Americans cling to that 
individualism as a kind of inheri­
tance that can’t be denied. 

Back home, the kind of indi­
vidualism I learned was steeped 
in moderation and boundless 
kindness. It taught that, as an 
individual, I have my own goals 
and make my own decisions, 
but only with the understanding 
that whatever I do either helps 
or harms some other individual. 
This is not a moralist perspec­
tive: I use “help” and “harm,” not 
“good” and “bad.” The true indi­
vidual is one who helps another 
individual, not by necessarily giv­
ing or doing something for them, 
but by refraining from that which 
would harm them. Even the “rug­
ged” individualist does not want 
to be harmed. And to the extent 
that I do not harm someone, I 
contribute to society by allowing 
for peaceful coexistence. Hence, 
this individualism considered the 
common good as a collection of 
individual goods.    

Since coming to America, 
my childhood view of Ameri­
can individualism has changed. 
Recently, I went with a friend 
to get groceries from a store not 
far from Yale’s campus. He took 
several items, as did I, but he 
was short two dollars. Bearing in 
thing for you and makes it clear 
that there are no strings attached, 
you don’t repay the person. And 
to return what one has given or 
rebuff what one has done out of 
goodwill is interpreted as a disre­
gard for friendship. 

It is this tendency to help others 
that distinguishes the individual­
ism I grew up with from Amer­
ican individualism. This is not to 
posit that American individual­
ism prevents compassion. Rather, 
it seems to discourage one from 
being at the receiving end of 
kindness. In this sense, American 
individualism turns the individual 
into a self-absorbing being, who 
brings his pride to every encoun­
ter. He finds it shameful to be 
assisted by another.

Relationships in America seem 
to embody a tension between one 
individual and another. In other 
words, individuals interact with 
one another with the presupposi­
tion that everyone comes to every 
encounter as equals, and there­
fore, no one must allow herself 
to be aided or ‘pitied’ by another 
person. Even when one asks for 
help she does so by offering some­
thing in return. The fear is that 
any acceptance of assistance—of 
whatever 
kind—means 
defeat; 
it amounts to an admittance of 
one’s weakness, one’s vulnerabil­
ity, one’s loss of self. 

But it is precisely this absorp­
tion into oneself that leads to 
selfishness. In Democracy in Amer­
ica, Alexis de Tocqueville warns 
Americans that “individualism 
at first dries up only the source 
of public virtues; but in the long 
term it attacks and destroys all the 
others and will finally be absorbed 
in selfishness.” If unchecked, indi­
vidualism instills in the individual 
an indifference to human suffer­
ing and vulnerability. He pays no 
mind that we are friends, I gave 
the two dollars to the cashier. 
Once we left the store, I told my 
friend that he shouldn’t bother to 
repay me. I grew up understand­
ing friendship this way: friends 
are supposed to assist each other, 
be there for one another, espe­
cially during times of uncertainty 
and when in dire need. Surpris­
ingly, after about a week, this 
friend transferred me two dollars 
through Venmo. How he guessed 
my Venmo username, I cannot 
tell. But I was taken aback, and 
realized that it was a cultural dif­
ference about individualism. Back 
home, when someone does some­
“I came to believe 
that America was 
the land of milk 
and honey.”
