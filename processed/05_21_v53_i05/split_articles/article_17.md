how important it is for us to stay 
connected to each other, to look 
out for each other, in as many safe 
ways as possible,” they wrote. 

Still, local groups had to deter­
mine if they would allow con­
tactless sharing of essential items, 
and how they would change their 
restrictions over time. In New 
Haven, Darwinsdottir explained 
they 
have 
transitioned 
entirely to porch pick-up, with 
no face-to-face contact. While 
this change has limited the abil­
ity of members of the community 
to interact with one another, she 
is grateful that the project can 
continue. “I don’t think it has 
changed the core of the resulting 
project, but [face-to-face interac­
tion] is something that we would 
like to do again once this is over,” 
she told me.

Looking back on the proj­
ect before the pandemic, Carey 
fondly remembered her first gift 
exchange, back when she was 
starting her own group in 2015, 
in South Windsor, Connecticut. 
She received a French press, but 
to Carey, the material gain of a 
new appliance was not the most 
important part of the interaction. 
“I went in, and then I met her kids, 
and I met her cat, and they were 
asking me all these questions and 
it was just really fun,” she recalled. 
“We’re friends to this day. And I 
guess that her friendship is some­
thing that I value more than the 
French press.”

Darwinsdottir similarly recalled 
one of her first exchanges, in 
which she gave away a baby toy 
to another community member. 
“I remember that a mom asked for 
it, and then she sent me a picture 
of her baby playing with the toy,” 
she explained. Given the joy she 
felt when she was able to see her 
gift put to good use, Darwinsdot­
tir encourages members in her 
group to make “gratitude posts’’ 
upon receiving a gift. “It’s always 
nice to go to the page again and 
say thank you, and maybe tell a 
story of why it helps you, or why 
you were happy with it.”

In addition to these tangi­
ble gifts, people can give other, 
non-material gifts, which Dar­
winsdottir categorized as “the 
gift of self, the gift of talent, and 
the gift of time.” One example 
she mentioned was a community 
member offering to take care of 
someone else’s plants while they 
were on vacation. To her, the 
project is much more than just a 
place to give and receive items, 
but a place to engage with one’s 
community and support others.

“Our 
interactions 
and 
our 
guests are grounded in people, 
and they’re grounded in narra­
tive,” Carey emphasized. “They’re 
not grounded in things, or in 
money… It’s wonderful, but it’s 
also really messy.” She recalled 
an instance in the South Windsor 
group when a woman who had 
just undergone a mastectomy was 
giving away her bras. “The story 
of this woman as a survivor is so 
much more important than the 
material of a bra,” she noted.

In her eyes, the Buy Nothing 
Project challenges modern-day 
consumerism, centering gratitude 
rather than material items. “Con­
sumerism is really predicated on 
this idea that we have very little, 
and that we always need more, so 
it’s about constantly filling this 
emptiness,” she said. “Gratitude is 
really the antidote to that. It tells 
us that we have enough. And that 
we have to give.”
