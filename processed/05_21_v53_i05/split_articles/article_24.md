“Paris.’ I felt so guilty being in this 
place of so much opulence. My 
brain was exploding.” 

All three of the student care­
givers I interviewed spoke of the 
dissonance between the concerns 
Yale expected them to have and 
those that dominated their day-
to-day thoughts. Naomi, who 
used income from her off-campus 
job to pay her family’s bills when 
the pandemic began, while also 
helping her younger brother with 
technology needs for his online 
classes, expressed frankly, “School 
was the last thing on [her] mind.” 
Caregiving responsibilities took 
priority over grades, internships, 
and what Margaret described 
as the general pressure to “con­
stantly over-achieve” that feels 
inescapable on Yale’s campus. As 
I heard these remarks, I recalled 
how frequently peers across Yale 
have voiced frustrations with the 
college’s high-pressure culture— 
and how rarely they are able to 
extricate themselves from it. For 
Margaret, the past months of 
caring for her father have been 
the primary exception to the 
“competitive extracurricular and 
leadership culture” that she was 
immersed in during high school 
and her freshman year at Yale. 
While caregiving involved some­
times overwhelming stressors, it 
also offered students a sense of 
identity beyond productivity or 
“success” as a Yale student. Stu­
dent caregivers found new pri­
orities: staying grounded, being 
intentional about their behavior 
towards friends and family, and 
improving themselves “beyond 
Yale’s strict definitions,” in Mar­
garet’s words. Care deepened 
the quality of their lives in many 
ways. Rather than viewing care­
giving as an obstacle to their suc­
cess, they sought to affirm their 
roles as caregivers, while lessen­
ing the burdens they carried as 
students.


Huddling with her family in 
their living room as the power 
flickered 
back 
on, 
Margaret 
jumped up to plug in her laptop 
and email her residential college 
dean to ask for help in receiving 
an extension. “I sent her a news­
paper article about the power 
outage,” Margaret said.  Though 
the dean had not requested proof, 
she felt like she “had to do that.” 
With the email sent, she and her 
sister gathered at her father’s 
desk, a small wooden table with 
barely enough room for their 
bulking computer, a mouse, and 
two hard-backed chairs. The two 
daughters spent the remainder of 
the evening helping their dad talk 
through and type up the contents 
of emails and documents.


Margaret credits her relation­
ship with her dean, who eventu­
ally helped her get an extension 
on that paper, as being a major 
source of academic support over 
the past few semesters. Leading 
research on student caregivers’ 
experiences echoes this, finding 
that strong advising relationships 
are crucial to these students’ suc­
cess. According to a 2017 paper by 
University of Iowa researcher Lisa 
Schumacher, caregivers at earlier 
stages in their academic careers, 
or who lack the social resources 
to establish advising relationships, 
are left at an even greater risk of 
falling behind. Though the advis­
ing relationships were valuable to 
Margaret, they still felt limited to 
her capacity to perform for Yale: 
“It was more so, ‘How can we 
make time for you to complete 
these assignments?’ than, ‘How 
can we make this less stressful and 
ease this burden for you?’” After 
receiving the extension, concerns 
about her father’s condition still 
made it difficult for Margaret to 
concentrate on the paper. She 
was able to find resources to nav­
igate the logistical challenges, but 
not the emotional dimensions of 
caregiving. 


Yale’s 
sole 
institutional 
resource directed at student care­
givers is Dwight Hall’s Family 
Support Fellowship, which offers 
stipends and opportunities for 
community building to students 
supporting their families through 
the COVID-19 pandemic. When 
I spoke with Mark Fopeano, the 
fellowship’s administrator, about 
the origin of the program, he 
confessed that a conversation with 
a student last spring revealed to 
him the limitations of his knowl­
edge about students’ experiences, 
and left him “[feeling] silly that 
I had made this assumption that 
just because a student was 20, that 
they didn’t know what it was like 
to have to work with young chil­
dren around.” That conversation 
and further dialogue with stu­
dents and administrators shaped 
the fellowship, which launched 
in the fall and provides 34 stu­
dents 
with 
stipends 
between 
$318.75 and $1,275 per semester. 
The application process is short—
students enter their names and 
addresses then select one of the 
following types of family support 
they provide: 
1.	 Supporting the academics and 
social emotional development 
of school-aged family mem­
bers
2.	 Providing basic needs support 
to at-risk family members,
3.	 Extending care for family 
members recovering from 
COVID-19, or
4.	 Other
 Fopeano stressed how import­
ant it was that students can access 
the fellowship’s resources without 
having to divulge sensitive infor­
mation about their experiences—
both lessening the burden on 
already overwhelmed students, 
and limiting administrators’ role 
in deciding which student care­
givers are “most deserving” of 
support. In its most recent round, 
all of the applicants received the 
fellowship, though the future of 
the program remains unclear as 
Yale plans for a return to a fully 
in-person campus in the fall.


The fellowship is a first step in 
acknowledging the variety and 
complexity of students’ expe­
riences and responsibilities. A 
further step would be to fulfill 
the demands of Students Unite 
Now (SUN)—echoed by all three 
interviewees—to eliminate the 
student 
income 
contribution, 
which intensifies the burden of 
students who financially contrib­
ute to their families’ needs. SUN 
is also fighting to diversify and 
strengthen Yale’s Mental Health 
and Counseling Resources, which 
could help connect students with 
socioemotional support as they 
navigate caregiving responsibili­
ties. Danielle also suggested that 
Yale professors increase flexibil­
ity in scheduling office hours and 
offer recordings of lectures to 
accommodate students who work 
long hours. Professors and admin­
istrators could implement these 
policies without demanding that 
students divulge sensitive infor­
mation regarding their personal 
circumstances. These improve­
ments would help remedy Yale’s 
unrealistic demand that, as Dan­
ielle says, “students keep going 
no matter what. There’s no space 
to grieve, mourn, or be human; 
you’re expected to first and fore­
most be a Yale student, when 
first and foremost we are peo­
ple.” Institution-wide reforms to 
financial aid, mental healthcare, 
and teaching policy could move 
to honor the wide range of iden­
tities and responsibilities among 
student caregivers, and in doing 
so, transform our campus into a 
place where all students are sup­
ported as their full selves.


At the end of our conversa­
tion, I asked Margaret about her 
favorite memories of the time 
spent with her family over the 
past year. She laughed and rem­
inisced about watching Antiques 
Roadshow with her parents. As 
the night darkened after a long 
workday, they would gather in 
the family room and climb onto 
the couch. “We’d watch on the 
TV, which is so old; it belonged 
to my grandparents actually, so it 
just turns off at random times.” 
Nestled among her family as they 
laughed and shared reactions to 
the show, Margaret felt herself 
relax: “It was just good to talk 
with them about things in my life 
and in the world beyond the con­
text of Yale.”
