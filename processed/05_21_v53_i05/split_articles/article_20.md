Three-quarters of the way 
down Wooster Street, past 
Sally’s Apizza and Frank 
Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, sits 
Zeneli Pizzeria e Cucina Napole­
tana, a small, one-story storefront 
with a streetside cabin for outdoor 
seating during the pandemic. 
I walked into the restaurant at 
10:00 a.m., just as Gazmir Zeneli, 
the master pizza chef,  arrived to 
start rolling dough for the day. 
“Espresso 
or 
cappuccino?” 
asked his brother, Aleko, whose 
hospitality made me feel imme­
diately comfortable, as though 
I were a regular. With a warm 
cappuccino in hand, I watched 
Gazmir, a jolly, thirty-or-so year-
old man with dark hair and a wide 
smile, roll the fresh mass of dough 
into sizable spheres, one for each 
pie. “We make pizzas one size 
only—personal. That’s the way it 
was invented.” 
Old-fashioned. Original. Nea­
politan. That is how Zeneli bakes 
its pizzas and distinguishes itself 
from the rest of the pizza joints 
on Wooster Street. Gazmir and 
Aleko, along with their two other 
brothers Jetmir and Jeshar, are 
originally from Albania. In the 
early 
nineteen-nineties, 
when 
communism was collapsing in 
Eastern Europe, the Zeneli broth­
ers emigrated across the Adriatic 
Sea to the Naples area of Italy, 
where they spent their child­
hoods learning to craft the perfect 
pizza napoletana. Twenty-two 
years later, three of the broth­
ers emigrated again, this time 
to the United States. “After ten 
years in New York, we took the 
opportunity to move to Wooster 
Street, New Haven—the epicen­
ter of pizza,” Gazmir explained 
as he started heating up their 
enormous, 
gold-plated 
wood 
fire oven. “I bake the pizza, my 
brother Jeshar is the master cheese 
maker, and my brother Aleko is 
the people’s person.” Gazmir, 
who was the previous executive 
pizza chef at Eataly NY and two-
time world champion pizzaiolo, 
narrated the history of pizza and 
the experience he and his broth­
ers provide for their patrons: “In 
1889, Queen Margherita of Savoy 
went to Napoli and wanted to 
see how poor people ate. She was 
given a pie with tomato sauce, 
fresh mozzarella, and basil. She 
loved it. What she ate is what we 
now call Pizza Margherita, and it 
is the pizza I bake everyday.”


Growing up in suburban Flor­
ida, many of the pizzerias around 
me were American chains like 
Domino’s or Papa John’s. The 
Italian food we think of in the 
United States is vastly differ­
ent from the kind of food the 
Zeneli brothers grew up eating 
in Naples. Recently, I became 
curious to learn how Ameri­
canization 
and 
modernization 
have impacted the Italian Amer­
ican community in New Haven. 
Everyone I talked to emphasized 
two historical developments that 
have threatened the community: 
the construction of highways that 
physically ripped through New 
Haven’s Italian neighborhoods, 
and the nationwide Americaniza­
tion of traditional Italian cuisine.


The two most common routes 
for a driver into New Haven are 
interstates I-95 and I-91. Ten 
lanes each at their widest point, 
these superhighways converge 
at an intricate network of ramps, 
bridges, and overpasses, connect­
ing motorists traveling to and 
from the Elm City. In the Long 
Wharf area, these highways stand 
along 
monumental 
structures 
built to the scale of the Ameri­
can superhighway. The striking, 
familiar,  blue-and-yellow IKEA 
sits next to the gray, concrete 
Pirelli Tire Building, now under 
renovation. Looming above is 
the maroon Knights of Colum­
bus tower, Downtown’s tall­
est building. Eighty years ago, 
however, this location would 
be unrecognizable. The colossal 
scale of the interstates and mod­
ern buildings are a product of 
New Haven’s “urban renewal” 
campaign led by Mayor Richard 
C. Lee in the mid-nineteen fifties. 
It was the age of the automobile, 
and cities around the country 
responded with the construction 
of mega-highways like I-91 and 
I-95, tearing into neighborhoods 
like Wooster Square, which was 
the heart of the Italian Ameri­
can community in New Haven. 
Forced out, Italians scattered 
across various suburbs, weaken­
ing the tight-knit community 
they’d been building for decades.
“I remember my mother telling 
me Franklin Street, where I was 
born, was destroyed, along with 
everything else,” Ed Surato, a 
65-year old librarian at the New 
Haven Museum, told me. “Peo­
ple to this day are very upset with 
Mayor Lee and New Haven rede­
velopment. I can tell how much 
has drastically changed by look­
ing at photos and maps. There 
are buildings still standing [in 
the affected areas], but they’re 
in 
much 
disrepair.” 
Accord­
ing to Anthony Riccio, New 
Haven historian and self-pro­
claimed “people archaeologist,” 
Wooster Square “triggers nostal­
gia, a certain feeling for history. 
“Wooster Street... 
it’s the only visible 
vestige of the Italian 
American heritage.”


All the other neighborhoods are 
destroyed and changed. Every­
one moved to East Haven, North 
Haven, Guilford, and other sub­
urbs. There aren’t many people 
from the original neighborhood 
left. But everyone comes back to 
Wooster Street, because it’s the 
only visible vestige of the Italian 


Suburbanization in response 
to urban renewal was not the 
only factor that diluted the tradi­
tional Italian community in New 
Haven. “Everything changed,” 
Riccio emphasized, his dog bark­
ing in the background of the 
Zoom call, “when American 
corporations became involved 
in hijacking Italian food, repro­
cessing and feeding it to Ameri­
cans.” Riccio, author of The Ital­
ian American Experience in New 
Haven, grew up in New Haven 
in the nineteen-sixties and nine­
teen-seventies . He told his own 
family history and discussed how 
his grandparents’ meager diet dif­
fered greatly from the conglom­
erates—like Papa John’s or Olive 
Garden—most Americans today 
associate with Italian food. 
In the early twentieth century, 
Riccio’s 
grandparents 
immi­
grated from southern Italy to the 
Annex neighborhood of New 
Haven. The area was mostly rural 
at the time with “open land for 
farming,” according to Riccio. 
In addition to their manufac­
turing day jobs, Riccio’s grand­
parents were farmers. “They 
needed food on the table,” Ric­
cio explains. “They didn’t make 
money in the nineteen-twenties 
or nineteen-thirties. They grew 
their own tomatoes, made their 
own wine, hung their own sau­
sage, and made their own lard 
in the cellar… You didn’t waste 
anything, because what you 
grew is what you ate. My own 
diet growing up was old-world, 
plant-based, and Mediterranean 
—food with greens, beans, and 
lentils.”


By contrast, Italian food in 
the U.S. transitioned in the 
mid-twentieth century to Amer­
icanized cuisine built on conve­
nience, variety, and capacity for 
mass production. Canned ravioli, 
frozen pizza, prepared tomato 
soup, and other ready-made food 
products introduced at the time 
shaped Americans’ conception of 
Italian cuisine. Riccio insists that 
the Americanization of Italian 
food, specifically brands like Chef 
Boyardee, became much more 
popular than the simple Mediter­
ranean diet he was used to eating 
at home. “Those processed foods 
that everyone eats now is not 
what we ate. Simplicity… simple 
flavors are the best for you and 
taste the best. Now, it’s a mania.” 
“In America, you have to think 
big,” said Aleko Zeneli. That’s 
posed a challenge to their stan­
dard of serving the finest, original 
Neapolitan pie. “Everyone here is 
used to so many options, so much 
advertising, that people lose the 
taste for simplicity.” The Zeneli 
brothers insist that their custom­
ers try their pizza as it appears 
on the menu, without extra 
toppings, to taste the authentic 
Neapolitan flavor. “If they really 
want to sprinkle parmesan or red 
pepper flakes, like they do here in 
the U.S., at least make them try 
the pizza as it is to see if they like 
the flavor of our pies,” said Aleko. 


With all the change Italian cuisine 
has faced in the U.S. in the past 
century, Zeneli is all about pre­
serving the old-fashioned, Nea­
politan pizza tradition, just the 
way Queen Margherita tried it 
in 1889. “If you haven’t tried this 
pizza, you haven’t tried pizza,” 
Gazmir chuckled, as he pointed 
behind me toward an elderly man 
sipping red wine with a friend. 
“Just ask him,” Gazmir told me. 
“He comes in every morning.”


The man’s name was Bill 
Iovanne, 88-years old and the 
long-time owner of Iovanne 
Funeral Home on Wooster Place. 
Even though the business is now 
run by his son, Bill has chosen 
to remain in Wooster Square. 
Sipping his wine, he radiated 
with nostalgia as he told me how 
much he loved growing up in the 
neighborhood. “Wooster Street 
to me is unbelievable,” he said. 
Bill was born in 1933 in Fair 
Haven, but soon after, his fam­
ily moved to Wooster Square. 
“I thought everyone was Italian 
here. The shops, the churches, 
the schools, all of them.” 
“People moved out gradually, 
to East Haven, North Haven, 
Branford, all over. But this street, 
Wooster Street, has stayed the 
same.” No matter how far away 
the descendants of  New Hav­
en’s Italian immigrants may have 
moved, Wooster Street still serves 
as the meeting point for families 
and friends to gather and eat clas­
sic New Haven food. “I’ll never 
leave here,” Bill reassured me. “I 
just love it.”
