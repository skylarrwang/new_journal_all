"Get lost, kid," the cop hisses at 
me, clutching his billy club more 
tightly. I'm sitting on a folding chair 
which juts into the path of pedestrian 
traffic at Fifty-third and Fifth. "Sure, 
sir," I answer with mock deference. I 
see his badge: Howells. He stands 
staring down at the wood instrument 
propped between my knees, a $2,000 
Romanian Tiger Cello, on which I'd 
just been playing the prelude to 
Bach's Third Cello Suite ... "Get lost," 
Howells reiterates, brandishing his 
club above the burnt red luster of the 
instrument. I cut short right in the 
middle of a sixteenth note run. Four 
or five pedestrians who have stopped 
to listen disperse, several dropping 
coins (and one a bill) in the large 
green suitcase I use as a till. I 
pack my cello in a canvas carrying 
case, fold up my music stand, and 
throw it into my suitcase along with 
the cardboard sign which has been 
dangling beneath. Staggering under 
the weight of cello, chair, and coin-
logged suitcase, I hide in the ground 
floor maze of a nearby office building. 

Fifteen minutes later the coast is 
clear. I steal back and set up shop. 
My perch is a five-foot-deep alcove 
beneath the silver ceiling of Ted 
Lapidus, a stylish woman's boutique. 
The Lapidus window is a glistening 
expanse of glass and near-sheer metal, 
showcase for leather handbags and 
matching boots, paisley summer 
skirts, a set of women's ties - and 
nebulously reflected in the background 
glimmer, a blond cello player. I face 
out toward the street, impeding 
slightly the flow of pedestrians. In 
going around me, some people drop 
coins in my case. Others kick it. A 
half moon of onlookers surrounds me, 
then disappears. From across the 
street a lanky black man shoots a 
quarter in the direction of my till with 
a one-hand jump shot. He misses and 
a truck prints the image of an eagle in 
the wet tar of 53rd Street. 

Business is bad. Middle-aged 
women eye me askance and their 
children point at me. A dog 
approaches my till with hind leg 
cocked threateningly. An old English 
professor of mine walks past without 
acknowledgment. Down the block 
coins tinkle in a metal bucket. It 
sounds like a cash register gone 
berserk. Sam, a blind Vietnam vet, is 
raking it in with his Nixon imitations. 
The police can't hassle him because 
he's handicapped. I consider trying to 
get certified as blind, nix the idea 
because I wouldn't be able to use my 
music anymore. (Last week Howells 
threatened to take me down to the 
police station for booking. Since then 
I've been calling the station house at 
eight every morning just to find out 
which beat Howells is taking. Once I 
complain anonymously that a certain 
policeman, one Sergeant Howells, is 
abusing some of the local artistes.) 

Moreover, my grandfather's law 
office is just down the street, within 
blushing distance. He's even more 
dedicated to getting rid of me than 
Howells. "Bad advertising," he says. 
"And that picture of you in The Times - 
a lot of people recognized it!" I try to 
hear Bach instead of his words. "What 
are they going to think - your father 
can't feed you?" 

Business finally starts to pick up. A 
pretty blonde girl in sandals and pink 
sun dress regards me with profound 
sympathy ... "The bour√©e," she says, 
"Bach's Third." I nod, smiling. She 
leans over, leaves two dollars in my 
till, and kisses me with infinite care 
on the forehead. Fifth Avenue smells 
like a sunflower as she disappears, 
Saks-bound. 

Now a gang of Japanese men shows 
up snapping away frantically on 
Nikons. When they're through, they 
reward me with courteous bows, 
coins, and an instamatic shot freshly 
developed. A German youth corps 
replaces the Japanese gang; after the 
tune a blond-haired boy offers me his 
address in Hamburg ... "Bach," he says 
with an almost edible "ch" sound, 
"ach." 

It's around midday in the middle of 
a city summer. The tar is beginning to 
buckle and ooze, leaving a pungent, 
burning odor. A bus honks and I 
realize why car honking doesn't 
bother me but bus honking does: buses 
honk in G, the key I'm playing in. I 
think of ways my music mixes and 
clashes with the pulse of city life. I 
watch the pace of the pedestrians 
who rush past. Quickly. Jauntily. I 
program my tempo to the beat of the 
street. In time. Walking in tune. My 
music, in tune. Listen to the click of 
high-heeled shoes. Use it. My music. 

Somebody gives me an apple. 
Somebody gives me a hot-rock 
sauna coupon. Three visits with any 
of twenty hot rockingly lovely 
Rockettes. Free. 

Somebody gives me a few tokes on 
a jay. My music improves. I 
remember these things. 

A few minutes later a friend arrives 
from Deli City across the street. 
"Here you go," he says, unbagging a 
Coke. I'm still playing when he slips 
the straw into my mouth. It's like a 
freak show - "see the kid slurp 
without missing a beat!" I take a 
break and ask him a favor: "Just keep 
feeding my till with quarters every few 
minutes, and clap profusely each time 
I finish." He does so, tossing coins 
into my till. A friend from school 
shows up and begins pumping my till 
with quarters when anyone's watching, 
taking them out whenever no one's 

It reminds me of the way I once 
worked the Central Park Summer 
Festival with my little sister. For 
Agamemnon she was a five-year-old 
princess in a House of Atreus pose 
looking hungry. Beside her was me, a 
menacing, be-toga'd musician wearing 
a sign: "Don't let this ogre eat his 
daughter, your contribution can feed 
them both." 

A percussive clanging noise rumbles 
down the street. Soon I distinguish 
Indian whoops and drum banging, the 
clink and clatter of cans. My music is 
fractured. It's not worth playing so I 
sit back and resin my bow, listening 
as the noise comes closer. People on 
Fifth Avenue scamper to the fringes 
of the sidewalk to avoid the banging 
and those producing it. It's a troupe 
of nuts, shaven-headed figures with 
pony tails thrusting up solitary from 
the mounds of their skulls like 
unicorns. All of them wear the same 
tan-colored robe, and all are pale as 
the sidewalk. They chant mesmeric 
"Hari, hari, hari" as they go past. 
Each member of the procession drops 
a pamphlet in my till. They march on, 
whooping and banging, as I read one 
of the pamphlets: "Meeting under the 
bridge, Thursday, Love - Hari." 

My till begins to fill up rapidly. I've 
reached the point of satiation, a point 
I reached several days ago when one 
of my street-beggar brethren leered at 
my take in jealousy. "You have so 
much," he muttered almost apologetically 
as he reached into my till. Now he has 
so much. But I learned. I fortify 
myself against future rip-offs. I 
sharpen the point on my end pin. 

Legs is back. That's what I call the 
hooker who works my corner. 
Mounted atop six inches of cork 
platform heels, she looms large and 
leggy, replete with rouge-smeared 
cheeks and a halter top designed not 
to stop. Sometimes Legs works with 
Fingers, the nattily dressed pickpocket 
who carries a fob watch and cane. 
Fingers keeps an eye on everyone who 
takes out a purse or wallet to give me 
a contribution, verifying where the 
money comes from. He watches what 
pockets are involved. Rather than 
making his play right there in front of 
me, Fingers usually trails his victims 
down the street and rolls them at the 
stop-light. Once I tried to tell Howells 
about this co-worker of mine, but he 
just accused me of scape-goating. 
"Punk," he said, and threw me out. 
Now I keep a sign inside my case: 
"Beware Pickpockets - and Police." 

After a time Legs and I strike up a 
conversation and Fingers joins in. I 
get to know them, my neighbors. 
They come by in the morning and ask 
me how I'm feeling, whether I think it 
will rain, what do you call the thing 
I'm playing. They offer me a cut of 
their take, but I decline ... "You're a 
class kid," Legs tells me. 

A fat, affluent-looking man, in a 
fine navy suit, stops me in the middle 
of a largo passage. Pink face 
twitching, he asks me a question. 
"Aren't you my son?" He tries to hug 
me in the middle of Fifth Avenue, in 
the middle of my largo. I free myself 
and point the tip of my bow at him: 
Beware.

behind me and begins singing a vocal
