The bike I rode was a ten-year-old 
Schwinn with balloon tires and busted 
sprockets. My blue sales case in the 
baby seat behind me jumped up 'and 
whacked me each time my bike hit a 
bump. The wind whipped past my 
ears. The green mountains, white lines 
and smooth farmlands rushed by in aÂ·. 
blur. In was 8:30 in the morning and I 
was barrelling down Rt. 60 through 
West Virginia mountains towards a 
place called Saltrock, where I 
imagined barrel-bellied hillbillies 
would meet me with shotguns. Two 
weeks ago I had been staring at the 
keys of my typewriter at 3:00 in the 
morning, trying to beat out a paper 
on the Hamlet imagery in Ulysses; 
now I was peddling down a mountain 
with 20 pounds of books behind me. I 
wanted the denizens of Saltrock to 
buy them. It was my job, you see. 

I stopped, put my sales case down 
and looked up and down 8th Ave. in 
Saltrock, W.Va., trying to decide 
where to go. The houses were not 
small, but most needed paint. Almost 
every house had a porch with a porch 
swing. Old people rocked slowly back 
and forth on their swings, watching 
life pass by their front walks. Flocks 
of plastic ducks and geese filled their 
yards and pink plastic flamingos 
dipped their heads into plaster bird 
baths. In one of the front yards I saw 
a big wheel. Sounds of cartoons came 
from inside the house. Kids, I 
thought. I picked up my case and 
walked toward the house. It was 
small. The wooden steps were caving 
in and the whole porch sloped to one 
side. A few of the boards on the 
porch were missing and I stepped 
carefully around the holes. Toys, old 
clothes, a rusty bicycle and an ancient 
sewing machine were heaped on the 
porch. A skinny cat with matted hair 
and a bald spot on its head surveyed 
me silently. 
"Hi, kitty." I reached out to pat it 
and it darted under the sewing 
machine. The smell of urine, sweat, 
and children was suffocating. I put 
my case down, stepped back two 
paces, knocked and turned to the side. 
Nothing happened. I knocked again. 
The cat was staring at me from under 
the sewing machine and I purred at it. 
"Hey kitty, you want to buy some 
books, there's some great sections 
on ... " 

The door creaked and I whipped 
around. 
"Hi," I said quickly. "My name's 
Inge. I uh, Inge Hanson ... " I 
couldn't remember what came next. 
"How are you?" 

A red-faced man of about 50 had 
opened the door. Sparse white stubble 
grew in patches on his knobby head. 
Wrinkles cut his forehead into rows of 
arches, making him look extremely 
startled. Two little children by his side 
stared at me. When I smiled at them, 
they darted behind the man's legs and 
clung to his faded overalls. I laughed 
and waved at them, then turned back 
to the man and began again. 
"Hi, my name's Inge, I'm just 
another one of those southwestern 
salesmen, y'all don't shoot them 
around here do you?" The man just 
looked at me. 
"Uh, hi, I'm Inge." 

He stood there. I looked at the 
kids. 
"Hi, you guys, how are you. What 
are your names?" 

They ducked behind their father's 
overalls again. The man opened his 
mouth. 

I smiled encouragingly. 
"Ahoooooooooabooooooeeeeoooo." 
"Uh, huh," I nodded my head. I 
didn't know quite what to do. 
"Is your wife home?" 

The man made a jerky sign with his 
hands. 
"Uh, huh, well, I guess I'd better 
go, nice, uh, meeting you." 

"He can't talk, he's deaf." 

A boy who looked 15 had come up 
the stairs behind me. 
"Oh, I see, what's your name?" 
"Jackie, Jackie Plank. Who're 
you?" 
"I'm Inge." 
"What do you want?" 
"I'm a Southwestern salesman and 
I've been talking to your parents ... " 
"Ooooooaheeeeeeeooooo." 
"Well, it doesn't really matter. 
Jackie, do you know if there are any 
other kids living in this neighborhood?" 
"Yeah, why do you want to know?" 
"I've got to talk with their parents 
about school books and stuff." 
"That what you got in that box 
there?" 
"Uh, huh, dictionaries and other 
books and stuff." 
"Yeah? Well, maybe mom'd be 
interested in them. I done quit school 
last year so I ain't got no use for 
nothing like that." 
"Your mom's home? Is she busy?" 
"Nah, you kin just come on in." 
"O.K." I picked up my case. "You 
guys want to see something really 
neat?" The two kids watched me from 
behind their father's legs. They smiled 
and looked at the ground. "Come and 
look." I said. 

Mr. Plank signaled something to 
Jackie with his hands. 
"Ooooooeeeeeah." 
"Yes, sir," I said. 

Jackie walked into the house and I 
followed him, stepping over a child of 
about two who was asleep on the 
floor. Kids were lying around the TV 
set. Their skin was smeared with dirt 
and magic marker. The stench 
thickened as I made my way after 
Jackie to his mother's room. 
"She's in bed cause she hurt her 
back a few days ago." 

Mrs. Plank's room was about the 
size of a closet. Her bed took up half 
the space and a crib filled the rest of 
the room. Clothes were piled in the 
remaining floor space and hanging 
from the ceiling. Jackie's mom was 
lying on her side in bed. She was very 
fat. I smiled at her. The only words 
that came to my mind were from the 
sales talk. 
"Hi, my name is Inge. I'm just 
another Southwestern salesman. Y'all 
don't shoot ... " 
"Oooooheeeeahoo." She looked at 
Jackie and waved her arms. 

I turned to Jackie. "She can't ... " 
"Mom can't hear neither." 
"Oh, I see, well um ... " 

I didn't know what to do. Should I 
give a sales talk to a deaf lady who 
was lying in bed, in pain, who 
probably didn't have any money? 
Should I leave, or sit, or move or ... 

Mrs. Plank pulled her bulk from 
the edge of the bed, pointed at me 
and slapped the mattress with her 
hand. 
"Ma wants for you to sit down." 

I set my case on the floor and 
looked at Jackie. 
"Go on, get you a seat." I sat on 
the bed. Mrs. Plank patted my leg 
and made a sign with her hand. "She 
says you're pretty," said Jackie. 
"Oh, that's nice. How do you say 
nice?" I asked him. He showed me 
and I made the sign, pointing at his 
mother. She smiled. "Ooooobahbeee." 

"Well, since I'm here I might as 
well show you these books," I reached 
down and opened the case. I thought 
back to sales school: "Be sure all the 
members of the family are present, 
that way you won't have to redemo 
the books several times." 
"Jackie, I'd like to talk with 
everyone here, would it be OK if you 
got your brothers and sisters?" I 
wondered if I should have him get his 
dad. "I guess you could get your Dad 
too, if he wants to come." I was still a 
little unsure as to what Mr. Plank had 
thought of my approach at the door. 

Jackie yelled into the other room in 
the house. 
"I don't like school, I don't want no 
books," came the reply. 
"Tell them it's really good," I said, 
"it'll help them so they won't have to 
take as much time studying." 
"Get in here or I'll beat your brains 
out." 

A few of the kids walked in. 
"Ah, hell, Jackie, I want to watch 
TV." 
"Jimbo!" 

Jimbo walked in slowly, followed 
by the two kids who had met me at 
the door and a few other children. 
There must have been at least six 
altogether. 
"Go git Dad," said Jackie. 

Jimbo stared at me for a few 
seconds, then waited out. He came 
back leading his father. 
"Hi, Mr. Plank." He stuck his hand 
at me and I shook it. We smiled at 
each other. I had the whole family 
around me, just like I was supposed 
to. Now I had to demonstrate the 
books. Oh well, the parents were deaf, 
but they could see. "Let me show you 
this." I reached for the case and 
pulled out the books. "Do you guys 
have problems with math, or English, 
or anything? What do you like best in 
schools? Or what do you hate most?" 

No one said anything. "Over here is 
the math section. It has math done 
the old way and the new way .....
