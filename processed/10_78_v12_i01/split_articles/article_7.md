. Of course,I could always play it safe -
set aside two weeks for foreign tr.avel 
. 
/.. 
and spend the rest of the summer 
earning New York bucks (my usqal 
act). But why play it safe at twenty 
when the stakes are still so low? I 
went abroad for 3 months to seek my 
fortune in Paris, France. 

For an urban freak and a wo~nded 
veteran of high schoo·· French, could 
there really ~ any destination but 
Paris? Apologies to Anglophil~s. but 
London seemed 1oo safe. And besides, 
life in New Haven had already ftlled 
.my quota for constant horizontal 
precipitation. Culture, cuisine, 
costume, and class were attributes 
that fit into. my preconception of 
Paris, the city. But I also remembered 
seeing a TV documentary as a child 
which focused on anti-American 
Freftch attitudes and showed the 
graffiti, "Yankee go home!" chalked 
onto an 18th century Paris wall. 

Then, as now, well-traveled Ameri-
cans insisted on portraying Paris and 
Parisians as the least friendly on the 
continent. 

Gay Paris, a place which has 
traditionally welcomed artists and 
political exiles; an environment 
steeped in history and tradition yet 
the birthplace of the avant garde in 
everything from haute cuisine to 
hemlines. En route from London to 
Paris I had perused a French for 
Travellers paperback so I could look 
for work and ascertain the price of·a 
single room as I waited for my high 
school French to miraculously return. 

My first triumph was the smooth 
execution of the purchase of ten 
Metro tickets. So elated by success at 
such a complicated task, I vowed to 
stutter and fall silent rather than 
speak English (first) to a Parisian. 

Almost without exception Parisians 
responded well to the sound· of their 
own language:·never a nasty "quoi?!?" 
in response to an innocent mispro-
nunciation. Surly fruit marchands 
aside, the Frepch were downright 
friendly. One cold, misty August night 
a. friend ·and I had over a mile to 
wall): from the train station to her 
home .in Marquise, which 'is near 
Boulogne on the Channel. We'd only 
walked a hun(ired yards whe~ a sedan 
stopped on the dar.k' road. A middle-
aged woman, accompanied by her 
young daughter. asked us if we 
wanted a ride. Cest Ia campagne. 

Once a young French· man on a 
mopec;t stopped his vehicle in busy 
Paris traffic to give me directions to a 
restaurant. I hadn't signalled at all; he 
just noticed my exasperated 
countenance as I misread my map. 
Cest Ia ville. 

In the second week of my Paris 
sojourn, I met an elderly MoroCcan 
man. He invited me to take mint .tea 
with his family. In a moment of 
extemporaneous articulateness on our 
way to his home, I told him I came 
across the Atlantic to discover the Old 
World. He repeated the phrase several 
times to his family during our tea. 

Many Americans travelling in Europe 
get the feeling that by communing 
with the Continent they can reach 
beyond television, steel, cowboys, the 
frontier, and Williamsburg, Virginia, 
to recapture the European roots of 
our nation's past. 

For reasons unknown, the four 
American things most important to 
the French are UCLA (or oochlah, as 
they call it), New York City, Fruit of 
the Loom T-shirts, and California, in 
that order. 

In the pouring rain around noon-
time one weekday I caught a glimpse 
of about eight construction workers 
eating lunch inside the back of a 
covered truck. They ~at around a 
table-covered with a table cloth and 
abundantly spread with food and 
wine. 

I saw the French way of life as 
more relaxed and refined than the 
AmeFican existence -
aperitifs and 
hors d'oeuvres before a meal, classical 
music with their ftreworks display on 
Bastille Day. The French, however, 
see themselves as mired in tradition 
and rigid forms. To them America 
was a place of quick action and 
substance, of Clint Eastwood and 
McDonald's. 

I once asked a chef how things were 
going in order to make friendly 
conversation. He replied in philo-
sophical seriousn~ .. How can things 
be when I work for another man?" 

This volatile fellow then proceeded to 
discuss his personal theories of 
alienation. Another time, I stood by 
as two middle·aged men screamed 
horrible insults at each other for an 
hour without more than a suggestion 
of physical contact. 

I could spot many Americans by 
their green Michelin guides, and from 
time to time I struck up a conversa-
tion with one of my countrymen . 

Most found Paris even more charming 
than they had expected, but few could 
ever "feel" the place in five days. The 
most popular books of an American 
in Paris were Hemir:tgway's A 
Moveable Feast and Orwell's Down 
and Out in Paris and London. 

An· amazing number of street 
nusicians play in front of cafes and in 
Metro cars and tunnels. Many even 
earn a decent living. Paris can be 
a warm, nurturing, and human city. 

Architectural observation: In 
London all the buildings look so 
important that they make one want to 
tip the hat 1n homage to history; in 
Paris all the buildings are that 
important, and one stands in awe. 

The, English-speaking community in 
Paris is large enough to sustain a fetal 
Village Voice called the Metro. If one 
is French, reading the Metro is' tres 
chouette, if one is Anierican, reading 
the Metro is a must. 

In manY, hours of shoppmg in open 
and closed' markets, I never laid eyes 
on br<><X<Oli in Paris. Few native 
French people knew what I was 
tallcing about when I mentioned the 
harmless vegetable grown right next 
door in Italy. 

Prostitution in Paris bears no 
resemblanCe to that on Manbattan•s.

Eighth A venue. Ladies of the night on 
the rue St. Denis were closer to call 
girls and beautiful models than to the 
New York model. Except for the 
problem of tax evasion, prostitution is 
legal. Because of police harassment 
and certain discriminatory govern-
ment policies, les ftlles went on 
unofficial strike for a few weeks 
· several years ago and they quickly got 
what they wanted; the incident was 
called the "dead streets" or something 
like that. From the great number of 
women all over the city, and the fact 
that many older women of the 
profession still faithfully twirl their 
room keys, one feels that prostitution 
is simply the respectable shop girl's 
reasonable alternative. 

The manager of a bar, an M.A. in 
economics from Georgetown, only 
spends time with French girls; the 
head bartender, a British air traffic 
controller recently of Saudi Arabia, 
only looks at English and Americans. 
Neither man is often without escort. 
Their paths have never crossed at the 
same women; the barman still h~ his 
iob. 

Both a taxi driver and a man who 
sells Louis Vuitton pocketbooks on 
the black market agree: the place for 
a French man who can speak English 
is New York; there he can easily have 
both money and women. As a 
foreigner who can hold his own in the 
language of the country he visits, a -
man stands a much better chance with 
the women, they. say. It's better all 
aroimd, they agree. The two men 
don't exagge~~ that much.
