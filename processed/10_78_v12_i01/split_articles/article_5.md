EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
You can get into culture in many 
different ways at Yale. If you're 
interested in our own culture, you can 
trek up to the third floor of the Art 
Gallery, where the Garvan Collection 
of American Art is housed. Yale 
pioneered the conception of American 
art as multi-media expressions of 
society and class, eschewing the 
traditional European notion that Real 
Art consists of painting and sculpture 
and nothing else. Today the Garvan 
Office (as the ~erican arts office is 
now known), coupled with a new 
research Center for American Art and 
Material Culture, is the only major 
American art institution tied to a 
unive('Sity. 

It was not until 1973 that a proper 
home was found for Yale's vast and 
important collection, when the 3rd 
floor of the old Yale Gallery was 
completely rebuilt to provide new 
office space and exhibition area. 

There is no question that the new 
Garvan Gallery was · both a revolu-
tionary and controversial approach 
to the display of decorative art. 

Museums had previously relied on the 
"period room" -=- historical settings 
for displays of furniture, paintings 
and other paraphenalia. This ap-
proach tends to result in quaint 
approximations of colonial kitchens 
or Federalist drawing rooms scattered 
with whatever historical objects 
happen to be available. In the Garvan 
Galleries individual art items are 
treated as art objects in themselves 
and are isolated from their historical 
settings. The new Garvan galleries 
consist of a maze of stark white 
panels that give the objects an 
abstract setting: chairs and cabinets 
are hung one above another, or are 
turned upside down to facilitate 
viewing of important design charac-
teristics. This deliberately didactic and 
analytic display leaves no room for 
historical atmosphere or ambiance. 

Rather than give the viewer a look 
backward, or gene~te a nostalgia for 
the past (something more effectively 
achieved at a place like Williamsburg, 
Va.), the Garvan installation presents 
American practical arts as creative 
acts, sometimes brilliant, sometimes 
awkward, but always telling. 

In a strange way the Garvan 
Gallery 'approaches practical art in the 
same way Marcel DuChamp and the 
Dadaists did. Everyday household 
objects are divorced from their 
natural settings and functions and are 
made to stand on their own. Where 
DuChamp ennobled a Snow Shovel 
(owned by, Yale) or A Plastic Bottle 
Rack, the Garvan galleries will often 
suspend a table or a cabinet entirely 
in mid-air. In one particular installa-
tion, examples of 20th century chair 
bottoms are arranged in rows like 
Andy Warhol's repeating Marilyn 
Monroe. The 18th and 19th century 
ironwork display is arranged on a 
panel in the same way an antique 
Sears catalog would illustrate the 
same items. This abstractive approach 
is extraordinarily effective if only 
because objects can be seen as designs 
in their own right. 

After five years of operation, the 
effectiveness of this form of presenta-
effectiveness of this form of presenting 
a culture can now be fully under-
stood. There is at least universal 
agreement that the new facility is 
vastly superior to the old one, simply 
because it is much larger. The 
designers, Paul Dietrich of the 
Cambridge Seven and Ivan 
Chermayeff, created new office space 
on a mezzanine to open up 10,000 
square feet of exhibition space. That 
more than 1,500 items -
more than 
twice as many as before -
are now 
displayed means that there is greater 
accessibility of the collections for 
students and scholars. Panels in the 
gallery are set up in diagonal fashion 
and aisles are made narrow to 
increase wall-space. High-technology 
features were incorporated wherever 
possible to save further space; a 
cqmpact electronic ferris-wheel rotates 
America's fmest silver collection at the 
flick of a switch; a large selectibn of 
old American prints is housed in 
convenient pull-out racks; light-
sensitive miniatures are stored in 
special flip-up drawers that light up 
automatically for viewing. 

More importantly perhaps, the 
Garvan gallery fits the needs of a 
university community. Displays are in 
chronological order, with a significant 
amount of wall text to explain various 
styles and periods and to place the 
objects in a historical context. 

Schematic time-charts and illustra-
tions are used whenever appropriate. 

Indeed this didacticism is one of the 
very targets of criticism. Many 
museum scholars resent being hustled 
down one long winding passage 
through the display. But when one 
remembers that most visitors are 
unfamiliar with the details of con-
noisseurship and history concerning 
decorative art objects (especially items 
like silver and furniture), one realizes 
that the museum must provide the 
necessary information. Charles Mont-
gomery, the first curator of the 
collection, sa"W a good museum as 
being something like a good teacher, 
and many of the Garvan Office's 
displays prove his 1>9int. One display 
actually dismembers an early 19th 
century chair in order to illustrate 
details and pro~ses of construction. 

The installers of the galleries tried to 
juxtapose and compare as many 
examples of a particular form as 
possible. Items are set on raised 
platforms or actually hung on walls. 

Thus the case furniture section, for 
example, would trace differences in 
design and function as seen from the 
18th to 19th century, between geo-
graphic areas, or between social 
classes. Comparisons can be made 
immediately in the gallery. If .as a 
the new journal, October 1978 
I 
result the galleries seem crowded, it is 
only because the designers felt that an 
object is more instructive on C:lisplay 
than in storage. 

Mo're than any other individual, 
Prof. Charles Montgomery was 
responsible for this successful center 
for the study of American art at Yale 
University. His tinexpected death this 
past spring has raised ·questions about 
the future of the Garv8 office. There 
is a great fear in the History~ of Art 
department that its faculty in Ameri-
can art will be permanently depleted, 
especially since the loss of Mont-
gomery was compounded by, the 
resignation of American painting 
specialist Ted Stebbins. Part of t~e 
reason for the Garvan Office's 
effectiveness was that many of its 
curators were also mem~rs of the 
university faculty. This is no longer 
true. Moreover there is further 
pressure from many donors Who want 
to see file's traditional strength in 
American decorative arts continued. 

The bulk of Yale's present col-
lection was donated by Francis P. 
Garvan in 1930. It was Garvan•s 
progressive realization that American 
art had to be studied as a mixture of 
media and styles that led to the 
establishment of an institute for 
American practical arts. It was 
Garvan's widow who provided most 
of the funding for the construction of 
the new exhibition galleries. The 
American arts office has been 
particularly active in recent years. The 
Garva~ Office is a healthy part of 
Yale's art institutjon. It is well staffed 
and well financed; there is great 
stUdent interest in the American 
practical arts. It can only be hoped 
that Yale will continue to support and 
facilitate its important cultural study 
center.
