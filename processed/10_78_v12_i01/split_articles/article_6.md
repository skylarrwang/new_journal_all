NJ: How did you first become 
interested in television? 

Mr. X: Well, it all began when I 
was 3 years old. I went over to the 
TV and turned it on, with no idea of 
what would happen. First it began 
emitting sound, and then images of 
men began to appear -
not only 
men, but also a rabbit, a moose, and 
an enormous clock with eyes on it. I 
now believe this was an early episode 
of "Capta!n Kangaroo." Of course I 
was captivated at once, and spent 
weeks wondering how these men got 
inside the TV, and where they went to 
the bathroom. 

NJ: Yes, but when did you first 
begin to realize the potentials of 
television as a medium? 

Mr. X: I guess it was shortly after 
my fourth birthday that I discovered 
you could change the channels. After 
that I entered a rather impassioned 
period of channel-flipping, paying 
particular attention to the static 
ground in between stations. When I 
was seven, I began exploring the 
picture control dials; horizontal hold 
was a great source of inspiration. 
Three years later my family got a 
color set and I went into a long 
discolo.ration phase, turning the 
people's faces green, pink, purple, and 
so on. At 15 I was tuning in UHF 
stations, and my career was well 
underway. 

IVJ: I see .... 

NJ: Mt. X, you seem to have 
cause9 a great deal of controversy in 
the world of broadcasting -

Mr. X: Controversy, hell. They're 
after my butt·. 

NJ: Er, yes. Well, perhaps you 
could tell us why this is. 

Mr. X: Sure. Be glad to ... . 
Basically I see myself as a Christ-
figure. You- know, martyr for the 
common cause, pioneer of personal 
freedom set upon by repressive 
superstructure, courageous and 
idealistic even in the face of great 
personal risk, that sort of thing. Of 
course, these are all subjective views. 
Still, you've got to admit rm putting 
my neck out on the line, and I don't 
even have a beard to protect it like 
Solzhenitsyn does. 

NJ: Are you comparing yourself to 
Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, the noted 
Russian writer and humanitarian? 

Mr. X: Damn straight I am. Why is 
everyone so awed by him, anyhow? 
He's just a normal guy with a little bit 
of guts who was lucky enough to be 
born in a repressive society. What 
about the rest of us poor slobs? Can 
we help it if our countries don't have 
Siberian work camps? Is that our 
fault? Hell, it's amazing how far you 
have to go to get persecuted these 
days. Just when you think vo11 
finally made it, you look around and 
The New York Times is behind you. 
It's disgusting. 

NJ: Nevertheless, you seem to be 
only too happy to JCeep otsrung tt ouL. 
All ttie programs we watch today are 
just slightly evolved forms of All in 
the Family or Happy Days. 

NJ: How do you explain this 
phenomenon of perpetuation? 

Mr. X: I'm glad you asked that 
question. That relates to a very 
personal theory of mine, developed 
over long years of tremendously 
insightful observation of the broad-
casting world. 

NJ: Would you share this theory 
with the readers of The New Journal? 

Mr. X: I will if you really vfant to 
hear it. But you'd better be sure you 
really want to, because it takes a 
while to explain and I think some of 
it might be over your head. 

NJ: Please, go ahead. 

Mr.- X: All right then. You see, my 
theory is that we've entered a new era 
of programming. About 15 years ago, 
when the sit com developed, it really 
was a situation comedy: that is, it was 
made up of a character or characters 
being placed in ridiculously absurd, 
impossible situations. For instance, 
remember "It's About Time?" About 
the three astronauts who somehow 
landed on prehistoric earth and 
brought back a bllnch of Neander-
thals to the present day? Or how 
about "The Second Hundred Years," 
about the guy whose great-
grandfather comes to life after 
spending a century frozen in a glacier? 
Both are amusing premises, but, 
naturally, ·we know they could never 
happen. The day-to-day experiences 
of a man living with a precocious 
genie, or a secret Martian, or a sea-
captain's ghost, or an automotive 
reincarnation of his mother, may not 
have been very instructive or en-
lightening but at least they bear no 
resemblance to reality. They were 
mere pieces of fluff, elaborately 
reproduced fa.Qtasies, meaningless 
wastes of time. However, among these 
airy tumbleweeds a very dangerous 
seed was talcing root. It was a seed 
that was planted back: in the 
beginning by "I Love Lucy" and 
"Father Knows Best." Then, watered 
by corporate wealth and steeped in 
the manure of Hollywood screen-
writing, it grew up through ••A Family 
Affair,", .. The Dick Van Dyke Show" 
and .. The Brady Bunch." Then 
Norman Lear came along, and the 
.. real-life comedy" was here to stay. 
Oh, sure, we still call them situation 
comedies. But what kind of situations 
do we have now? A man living with 
his family in a duplex in Queens. Two 
women living in a New York 
apartment. A woman living in Tarry-
town. A black family in a housing 
development in Detroit. These shows 
don't get their humor from situation. 
They try to show us how funny the 
experiences of real life are, and how 
funny real people are. In fact the 
characters are so real that people 
begin to see them as friends, or 
neagnoors, mayoe even toven, wuu 
the hell knows. Do you know that 
when CBS killed Henry Blake on 
.. M.A.S.H." there were people who 
put their flags at half-mast? And that 
elementary school children have spent 
weeks under the delusion that they 
were Vinnie Barbarino? And that the 
actresses in "Charlie's Angels" receive 
dozens of marriage proposals each 
week, addressed to their fictional 
character names? We believe in these 
characters, we adopt them for our 
own. More than that we actually 
experience through them. Their prob-
lems are carefully engineered to 
simulate our problems as much as 
possible. We don't just watch these 
shows, we live them. For the space of 
one-half-hour we take our place 
among the Bunkers, the Findlays, the 
Jeffersons, and live our life with a 
laugh track behind it. That's why 
we're so opposed to any form of 
change. Everything is hunky-dory at 
the beginning: all the relationships 
balance perfectly, all the vibes are 
good, everyone's needs are being 
satisfied. Any change that occurs is 
going to make ripples in an otherwise 
clear pool. It makes us feel insecure; 
what is life going to be like without 
Rhoda? Who's going to come in and 
talk to us while we make .dinner? Who 
will we talk to about our problems at 
work and our latest romance? Who 
will be flawed and unhappy enough to 
constantly bolster our ego? What if 
we can't fmd someone? What if Mary 
Richard is left as lonely and bored as 
we are when we watch the lousy 
show? What if she sits down and 
turns on the television? Good God, 
what then? I guarantee there'd be 
breakdowns and suicides all over the 
country the next day. We wouldn't be 
able to take it. If we ourselves can't 
be happy, at least we can be happy as 
Mary Richards. And why shouldn't 
Mary Richards be happy? If some-
thing goes wrong, all she has to do is 
make a joke and hundreds of people 
will laugh. It's guaranteed. Infallible 
ego support. If that laugh track: 
turned on her just once and started 
hissing, she'd fall apart ... anyhow, 
that's my theory. 

NJ: Does this relate to your plans 
fo( TMN-TV? 

Mr. X: Absolutely. 

NJ: What was your intention? 

Mr. X: Well, the danger behind this 
mimetic style of programming, as I 
see it, is that we all begin to dwell in 
these elaborately contrived video-
worlds. We develop little laugh tracks 
in our heads to help us out when we 
can't actually climb into the tube. 
Moreover, things that have been made 
funny on television -
childbeating, 
unwanted pregnancy, old age, homo-
sexuality, crime, delinquency, 
impotence, etc., etc. -can become 
inappropriately funny in real life. 
Little boys are already beating up on 
each other to be like the Fonz, and 
God knows that little girls watching 
TV now are going to grow up with 
neurotic breast anxieties. Our role
