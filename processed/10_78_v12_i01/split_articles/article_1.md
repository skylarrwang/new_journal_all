Still dressed with style, but most 
definitely Up, he was there. Not the 
Desire hat bobbing in the crowd. Not 
the workshirt of the festive blue daze 
jean throng. No, center stage Bobbi 
sports trim black plants with smart 
silver studs lining the leg. The 
matching vest and silk scarf added to 
the air of cool casual elegance: simple, 
stunning and Street-Legal. 

There's a long-time golden-haired stripper 
on stage 
As she winds back the clock, turns back 
the page 
Of a路 book nobody can write 
Where are you tonite? 

Not at the concert. Most everybody 
had heard the album on the radio. 
Most nobody wanted to see the show. 
Marie was supposed to see Dylan at 
the Yale Bowl in '66, but he broke his 
neck in the motorcycle accident. She 
remembers it happened the day before 
the show. She smiles when she 
remembers when. She used to rock 
and roll. But since she got married 
she hasn't been to a concert in she 
doesn't remember how long. 

Queen E. Mama Jane, she was 
there, "at Bangladesh." On the scene, 
man. An unbelievable dream. Come 
true? She came onetwothreefour five 
times, justlikethat. Jesus, I couldn't 
believe it. Christ, Dvlan. 

Sue, she stood on line all night long 
for Rolling Thunder Revue. When she 
was drunk, she always used to play 
"Lay Lady, Lay" on the jukebox, but 
Dylan just wrecked it on TV -
what'd he say -
forget this dance, 
let's go upstairs. She still listens to the 
record, though. 

Wendy's boyfriend used to play her 
the records. She never used to listen. 
And ever since she heard Dylan was a 
wife-beater, she hasn't had to at all. 
Not at all. 

WhenEver since: Dylan's defunct. 
shouldafnever/shoulda ... stayed 
Zimmerman, another jew-boy folk-
singer spinster, another dead Tue. nite 
in a dying club: Been makin' records 
with Pete Seeger; Singin's sweet but 
the wages are meager. Yes, in those 
rare sentimental moments路, Seth sits 
the kids, a family fireside chat: Your 
Granpa's seen more than his share of 
hard times, but he stayed true. 
Satiated with dignity, this virtue, kids, 
is humility. Moral: Age graciously. 
Or die young. Alone on a motor-
cycle on page 3. Sex, drugs, lurid 
disillusion. Dire Society, cruel and 
phony, reaps its victim ... Ruthlessly 
honest, apocalyptic" "Pure magic, 
graphic and mythic." Even Bob Dylan 
will pose NAY-KED. Time tested and 
true, it'll sell. 

Julie won't buy it though. She's got 
no bucks. Dylan's got'm all, and he's 
going to Vegas to get more, the 
toothless old whore. 

Why doesn't he retire? 


**Title: Stop, Look Around**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

Freshmen feel it as they step back for 
a few moments to ~bserve their new 
lifestyle with amazement. I expect 
seniors feel it too, probably even more 
frequently, perhaps more deeply. It is 
a love of youth and innocence and the 
love of losing them and learning 
more. 

But why is it that no one sings 
"Bright College Years" without a 
smirk? Why did the Yale men-boys of 
the 90's write sentimental poems 
about their college days while we 
write satire and churlish commentary? 
Ours is an age when all must pass 
too quickly -
the pages of a classic 
which must be read in a week, the 
miles traversed between home and 
school. We have no Yale fence upon 
which to sit and reflect; we congregate 
instead in Machine City where the 
fast food surrounding us encourages 
our haste. Our adjectives are short, 
our exclamations four letter long. We 
form our opinions as hastily as we 
live our lives, and abbreviate our 
personalities on message-printed 
T-shirts. 

The nostalgia Yale men once felt 
lind expressed for their college days -
even while living them -
showed a 
kind of self-awareness. They knew 
they were happy, they knew they 
Joved their esprit de corps, conven-
tions, caps, aspirations, and eloquent 
professors. They savoured Yale and 
youth, while we, busy being busy, do 
not stop to do even that. The chaps 
before sonic booms and renovated 
rooms wrote songs which they 
realized would grow more dear as the 
years passed by and single college 
experiences faaed into a fuzzy picture 
of irresponsibility, camaradeiie, amaze-
ment and health. Today we disparage 
because it's always easiest to criticize 
and because we don't have the time or 
inclination to appreciate all that is 
good. Re-reading our cynicism in 
silver-haired days (should we become 
so sentimental and have a free 
moment to spare), it will probably 
pain us. Nostalgia will teach us what 
we should learn now -
to respect and 
savour the richness of the present. 

These are bright college years with 
pleasures rife, the shortest, gladdest 
years of life. They should not be 
reduced to a frenzy of overnight 
reserve books, overnight relationships, 
and overnight decisions. They are 
years which might be spent in learning 
and loving, and learning from love, 
and loving that learning. 


**Title: The Greatest Gothic Gym**
**Page number(s): 3**

The Payne Whitney gym, which 
usually has the massive look of an 
enormous secret society or a maxi-
mum security prison, takes on a more 
etherial air at night. The statue over 
the archway (of Victory? Payne 
Whitney? Clean Competition?), lit 
from underneath, looks almost alle-
gorical. Above it the tower melts off 
into the darkness and light comes 
softly through the two rose 路windows. 
A few of the wet-haired faithful push 
through the turnstyle and lumber out. 
Inside, the towel person yawns in his 
booth while portraits of decades of 
swim teams, smiling gamely and 
sitting crosslegged, stretch off down 
the hall in both directions. Upstairs 
the air smells of chlorine. A few 
runners walk thoughtfully toward the 
indoor track, past the shadowy polo 
rooms with the padded walls and 
enormous wooden ho~~ A runner

**Title: Saratoga Summers**
**Author: Eva Saks**

A huge, bilious, jolly, stupefied 
"hello" to all .from atop the snowy 
bedsheets of my room. in DUH, where 
at press time I am still on the danger 
list after a deliciously decadent 
summer which left me on the very 
edge of the GRAVE!! (My sternly 
paternal physician has positively 
proscribed sex 路and champagne for the 
time being!) My titillation began in 
June when I was ushered into,the 
seamy enclaves of the CIA, bestowed 
with the onus of a ~ery heavy oath, 
and seated at a desk in a typing pool! 
It stuns, I am sure, to read that I was 
not flung into the very stratospheres 
of top secret espionage -
where I 
could be of some USE -
but they 
seemed to think that my reputation 
shed doubt on my ability to keep a 
secret. Quintessential bunk, I can only 
respond. Besides, they had no idea 
how many secrets I already knew, and 
I've never told a soul about their 
secret plot to buy up Agnew's novel 
and burn it for the energy crisis. What 
would this country be without strong 
national security? I query, and in 
response l can but opine: a fascist 
state. So whatever I on the merry 
wings of caprice may slip and tell you 
about government secrets, reader, 
LET IT GO NO FURTHER. I mean 
it ... anyway, it takes more than an 
IBM Selectric and a pile of boring 
governmental master plans to hold my 
interest, so I skipped out to do a little 
heavy-duty jetsetting on the Con-
tinent -
and I must confess that, 
along with PEOPLE magazine and a 
cast of dozens, I am agitated to the 
farflung horizons of angst about 
Monaco Mugsie (she tolerates my silly 
nicknames) and her new hubby, a 
social climber and a PHONY if ever 
my born days have seen one. I can 
understand how Caroline might turn a 
deaf ear to Princess Grace, the old 
snow queen, but when she won't even 
listen to me -
\vhat's a bosom buddy 
to do? Well, I LEFT- it just wasn't 
fun anymore, you dig? There were 
hundreds of other nearby pieds a terre 
on my master keyring, but Monaco in 
general was death on stilts, and I 
hastened my hejira lest I perish of 
ennui. (I was mere moments from 
rigor mortis when my plane lifteo 
off!) . . . tliere~s been a lot of 
hemming and hawing and foofaraw 
about my admittedly sassy relation-
ship with the upper echelons of the 
Yale administration, but cutting 
through the foggy haze of rumor is 
one mighty beacon of truth: we're like 
this. (I am holding up two crossed 
fingers as I write.) Proof positive of 
my claim is that after my narrow 
escape from M onaco, I passed 
through New Haven for a few days, 
and though it weakens me to think of 
what these two darlins went through 
to get my phone number, I was 
invited to a little impromptu "pass-
the-torch" party with Bart and 
Hanna. Bart was rather quiet and 
reflective -
even took a few notes -
but Hanna, no offense, was a real 
motormouth. She told me how 
excited yet essentially wistful she was 
about leaving Yale to .. wind westward 
to the windy City, the toddlin town, 
show you around ... "We should 
never have started those flaming shots 
of tequila, but what the hell, it was a 
special night. (Bart got a little singed, 
but only because Hanna insisted upon 
acting out the opening of the 
Olympics. What a filly!) Once Hanna 
boldly asserted that she could chug-a-
lug a pitcher of beer. l made the 
mistake of saying "~n not," and she 
retorted "can to," and five minutes 
later I gave in, at the risk of suffering 
a most repetitive evening. Good thing 
I did, too, because she poured it down 
in nothing flat, slamming the pitcher 
on the table with an .. eat your words, 
Summers." (I don't eat my words, 
Hanna, I just record over them.) 
When I asked her where she learned 
to drink a Mastodon under the table, 
she winked conspiratorially at Bart 
and gigg.led, .. Alumni. .. " 

My doubledear friend FEMINIQUE 
FONTAINE (no, wise guys, IT was 
named for HER) has become a rising 
starlet in politics! Knowing how 
starlets rise, I queried as to the 
possible decay of her rather cashmere-
ish moral fibers. She responded, in a 
voice that dripped mink, .. tell your 
readers that any girl who can't buck 
this big w~rld and keep her legs 
crossed should just hang up her silver 
stiletto-heel shoes and quit!~ Very 
stirring, dear, but don't be so hard on 
yourself -
I'm sure Fanne Foxe does 
quite well. 

Wasn't it fun this summer to see 
Yalies just popping up everywhere in 
the media? I think we got more press 
than Harvard, don't you? I mean, 
Vogue, Playboy, Mademoiselle~ I 
almost got one of those fabulous 
Mademoiselle makeovers, except they 
said I wasn't "before" enough. The 
silly flatterers! And I hope you didn't 
miss that engaging passel of Yalies in 
Co-Ed magazine -
the one with 
Donnie and Marie on the cover, in 
case your subscription ran out. I was 
amazed at how effectively their 
thoughts on dating and "relationships" 
catered to the needs of Co-Ed's early 
adolescent readership. This led me to 
suspect that the interviews were either 
exhaustively rewritten or quoted 
verbatim. Indecisions, indecisions! 

My dear dear friend BLOOMSBURY 
spent her summer reading Nancy 
Drew books and Richie Rich comics 
"to help psych myself up for the law 
boards and those oddles of applica-
tions." Good luck, darling -
when 
we're older you can help me sue my 
plastic surgeon . . . speaking of 
lawsuits, I am worrying less about the 
dangers of .. hear-say" these days 
because of a great surveillance device 
I discovered: a delightful gadget called 
a Unibug- a crazy little cutie who 
will travel anywhere -
li~e on some 
cozy comer of that third belt loop -
and transmit your sinful, scandalous 
words across the trembling New 
Haven air and onto the red hot tracks 
of my tape consoles! Even now, 
typists 路are working around the clock, 
transcrib,ing conversation for my 
upcoming book, YALE BABYLON. 

Well, ta-ta everyone- the night 
nurse says .. hi" to all, completely 
unaware that I just slipped a 
Shanghai Special in her Gatorade. I'll 
be out of here sooner than they think, 
and with a tank of anesthesia to carry 
out my newest project, code name . 
Unconscious People Photographed m 
Insinuating Poses. (Nothing succeeds 
like blackmail!) See you in the

lazy again ... 


**Title: Ask Eva**
**Page number(s): 3-4**

Dear Eva, 
Help! I am an off-campus second-
term senior with a full course load, 
two jobs, and no money. As if that 
weren't enough, I am also a trans-
sexual in love with a dead homo-
sexual actor. What would you do? 
-
M. 

Dear M., 
Come on, everyone has problems 
like yours. If that dead homosexual 
actor of yours knew what was 
happening in MY love life, he'd tum 
over in his grave. If I were in your 
shoes, I'd try wearing bright colors or 
all black. If that doesn't work, come 
up and see me sometime and I'll see 
what I can do, darling. 

I haven't been in Paris long, and 
when I meet a man, I'm always saying 
something wrong; I'm so Marsovian! 
For when a man would wed a girl in 
my own native land, he'll bend and 
kiss her hand. 
A Merry Widow 

Dear Merry, 
Do I hear a waltz? Merry, hand-
kissing went out with the buggy whip. 
Why not try the buggy whip? 

Last week D.U.H!s .. Don't stay 
worried or confused" Department told 
me that I was pregnant. My doctor's 
response was to prescribe .. bed rest, 
plenty of fluids, and two capsules of 
Sudafed every four hours." This 
approach seemed somewhat dated and 
dogmatic, even to a P . .O.R. member 
like myself (also inefficacious). What 
do you suggest? 
Worried and Confused 

Dear Worried And, 
If it's a girl, I suggest .. Margot." 

What to do, what to do. I am the 
rookie head of a prestigious New 
England corporation. Everything is 
going well except for one teensy 
problem. I'm involved in a fund-
raising campaign for my firm, and as 
the deadline approaches we're still 
several million dollars short of the 
target amount. Ideas, Eva? 
P. 
P.S. Already tried a bake sale. 

Dear P., 
You think you have problems 
NOW, wait 'till you fall in love with a 
broke off-campus second-semester-
senior transsexual in love with a dead 
homosexual actor. Then, ASK EVA!
