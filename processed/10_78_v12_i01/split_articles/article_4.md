EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Finding Montgomery Clift's modest brown townhouse on East Sixty-first Street is as easy as pie. Getting inside is, however, another matter entirely. The doorbell broke sometime in 1972 or '73 ("About the time Rhoda Morgenstern began losing weight," Monty recalls), and the famous award-winning actor has not yet seen fit to get it repaired. He has spent a long time pondering why this may be so. "It's a kind of passive-aggressive thing," he explains. "I have this basic . . . velleity to call in the electrician, but some kind of unacknowledged ... hostility toward most of the people who call on me, sort of ... it makes me not want to get it fixed badly enough to get it fixed. God-damn! I hope I'm not boring you."

Let it be known that absolutely no one has ever called Monty Clift boring. Neurotic, obsessive, brilliant, catty, generous, reclusive, dead, infantile, a lot of fun, a flibberty-gibbet, a will-of-the-wisp, a clown - yes; boring, no. He has been called other things as well. Louella Parsons once called him "radiantly handsome." Garson Kanin has called him "a beautiful actor, a darling guy, a tragic mess." Kenneth Anger, author of Hollywood Babylon, called him "Princess Tiny Meat." All of which is beside the point.

The point is, the doorbell was broken so I had to stand on the sidewalk yelling "Mr. Clift, Mr. Clift, Mr. Clift!" like a total fool until finally Monty's Filipino houseboy, Raoul, came down to the door to let me in. Sweaty and out of breath, I paused in front of the mirror in the front hall to take inventory of myself. My cream-colored cotton skirt almost but not quite matched my off-white rib-knit wool top, which was almost an exact duplicate of the one Elizabeth Taylor wore when she starred with Monty in George Stevens' A Place in the Sun, right down to the little fluffy round things which cover the whole blouse. My lipstick was still fresh, my nose perky, my eyes positively glittering with belladonna. "Right this way, please," Raoul said in his heavy Filipino accent. I paused a moment longer to adjust my hair, wondering if it looked windswept enough. Raoul leered contemptuously at my reflection. He must have thought I was a transvestite. Or maybe he just doesn't like women.


My first glimpse of Montgomery Clift in the flesh: He is sprawled over one end of a sofa in the middle of his very large, brown, austere living room. A somewhat scratched Ella Fitzgerald record, played quadrophonically, dominates the atmosphere and Monty. He keeps time, badly, with one foot which touches the floor. He sings, flatly, "You make me feel so young, You make me feel so spring-has-sprung. . . . "

At fifty-seven-going-on-fifty-eight (he must be the only adult in the world who gives his age like that), Monty Clift needs to feel young. The boy who wowed the theater world as Henry in the original 1942 production of The Skin of Our Teeth, the young heartthrob for whom Elizabeth Taylor would gladly have given up her eyes and Nicky Hilton, the drunken cripple whose stunning portrayal of a retarded Jewish eunuch in Judgment at Nuremberg moved director Stanley Kramer to tears, is now on the downward slope of life. To be sure, Brando, his rival and imitator, is but a few years younger, but Monty feels ancient, troglodytic, prehistoric by his own terrifying time sense. "Do you realize," he asks me in the course of a conversation, "that two out of three people in this country not only don't remember the Second World War, they don't even know who starred in it?" Monty remembers.

Monty wears his years well. Except for his hair, now grey and thinning, his appearance has not deteriorated noticeably in the last ten or twelve years. By his account, "clean living" gets the credit for his youthful looks. He quit smoking five years ago, has not had a drink since 1966. He quit Demerol the same year, although he still pops "an occasional Percadan, de temps en temps." Both arms still bear faint traces from his shoot-'em-up days, battle scars he displays with all the simple pride of an old salt showing off his tattoos.

"Welcome. Come in. Sit down," he says, stopping once to turn down the volume of the stereo. He paces again, stops again - this time to change the record - and, being an interviewer and all, I decide that it is time to pop the first question.

"Do you think," I ask brightly, "that you'll ever work in film again?"

Unexpectedly, he explodes.
"Film? What is it these days with this 'film' business? Always in the singular. Like it was like working in decoupage or something. In my day we said movies. We knew they were cheap entertainment. No illusions. People in this country are getting as bad as the French, mon vieux."

"Vielle." I cross my shapely legs.
"Whatever. I don't know ... " He sits down on the edge of the sofa, his forearms resting lightly on his knees, then suddenly jumps up again, his arms flailing wildly ... The movies they make these days ... Jee-zus. Like that crazy one about the two hippies on ... the real world isn't like that. And all these James Bond movies. And Last Brando in Paris. He always told me he preferred K-Y. Ha-ha. Joke. And all those horrible Ross Hunter sex comedies. The industry is going to the dogs."


Raoul enters with a Tab for me and a Tab for Monty. He is smirking again. Apparently he has caught Monty in the middle of an old routine, called, perhaps, the "Out-of-it Has-Been Routine." Monty looks embarrassed. He sits down again and says, in a low voice, "No, actually, I do keep up to date with what's going on. I think the general quality is much better today than it was in the fifties."

Another question. "Do you ever watch your old movies on television?"
"Sometimes."

There is a long silence as we both sip thoughtfully. When I am reasonably sure that he is not watching me, I straighten the seams on the back of my stockings. Seamed nylons are very difficult to find these days, but I recently discovered a place in the Village that has all sorts of things that haven't been seen since the Thresher went down for its last. I hope Monty notices.

"No, I'm not really into ... film ... anymore," Monty says. He walks over to the window. His fingers drum lightly against his glass of Tab. He glances at me, working his lower lip in the manner Paul Newman had mastered so well when critics called him "the new Montgomery Clift." He looks out the window again, his profile toward me, eyes narrowed to slits.

"Now I'm into ... video."


Jack Larson, a prize-winning playwright, who played Jimmy Olsen in the old Superman TV series, used to occupy rooms in the top floor of Monty's townhouse. Larson has long since moved back to California, and his old bedroom is now Montgomery Clift's private television studio. Monty has a video cassette recorder, two Porta-paks with cameras, a large color television, a black-and-white monitor, a big studio camera just like the pros use, and lots and lots of studio lights packed into one side of the room. There is very little furniture.

"I haven't been ... idle ... these past few years," Monty says in a Michael Parks monotone. His face brightens. "Would you like to see some of my work?" I say yes, and he says, "Fan-tastic!"

He pulls out a number of tapes from a lopsided stack on the floor and reads the handwritten labels on the side. "Oh, this one is ... good. But that's not the one I'm looking for. No ... no ... I can't find it. Here it is. Fantastic. Let me rig this up. There're some folding chairs over against the ... wall."

"What is it?" I ask, meaning the videotape.
"You'll see. I wrote it myself. It's dramatic: I only do ... dramatic things. It's a short biography of Harry Crosby." Harry Crosby was of course the nephew of J. P. Morgan who shot himself and his girlfriend on a reasonably dark night in 1929.

"Do you play Harry?" I ask.
"Yes. Watch."

We watch for five minutes or so, during which time Harry fights in the Great War, goes to Harvard, and runs off to Paris. Monty stops the tape.
"It's not finished yet. I can't find anyone to play Caresse Crosby. Nancy Walker offered to play Caresse, but I wanted her to play Josephine, the girl who gets shot along with Harry. It's a smaller part, but Nancy's never died on camera before that I know of, and I think it'll be a great opportunity for her."

"Have you got Nancy on tape?"
"Not yet. Except in a Bounty ad and a couple of Rhoda episodes I took off the tube. I'm in one of the Bounty ads, of course."

"I didn't know that."
"You didn't? I thought everyone knew. The one where they say 'But are they strong?' and Nancy says, 'Strong enough to lift these potatoes!' Well, I'm one of the people sitting at the counter, and if you look closely you can see the back of my head over in the left right after she says 'Strong enough to lift these potatoes!' They were very happy to get me for the ad. It was an in-joke on Madison Avenue a couple of years ago that Monty Clift did a paper towel ad. I didn't get any money for it though, I insisted on doing it free, just like Judgment at Nuremberg. Do you think Kathleen Widdoes would make a good Caresse? What has she done lately?"

"I wouldn't know," I reply sweetly.
"But I'd love to play Caresse."
"No, thanks. Thanks but no. You'd make the rest of us look ... old. Youth is wasted on the Jungians."


Monty offers to screen-test me, however. I am to take a sheaf of papers and look disgustedly at them and say, "Poems? Poems? You call these poems? Why, my dog can write better than this and she's only two years old!" We do a couple of takes and watch them on the monitor.

"You're very ... good," Monty says, and I demurely agree. "You remind me of somebody ... somebody special ... I forget just who."


Monty should have had plastic surgery after his face was smashed up in that grotesque auto accident in 1956. But he didn't. Photographs of him from the late 'fifties and early 'sixties show him looking like a wreck, which at the time he was. It isn't easy to go from being the handsomest actor of your generation to being one of the most dissipated-looking. But if the pain and disfigurement steered him ever more resolutely toward the bottle and syringe, his new face, with its vaguely Semitic cast, also enabled him to play roles (in Freud, The Young Lions, and Nuremberg) in which the old Monty would have looked just plain silly.

Had his luck and his health held up, Monty might have matured into a fine character actor, somewhere between Franklin Pangborn and Peter Sellers. (His faggy, mother-fixated bronco-buster in The Misfits is not only a brilliant characterization, it adds some sorely-needed ha-has to that overblown paean to decrepitude.) But then Monty had to contend with the disastrous Freud lawsuit, his addictions, and enough emotional and physical ailments to fill several medical casebooks. He has suffered from severe cataracts, amoebic dysentery, a rare form of calcium deficiency, and a number of other weird chronic things.

"I really don't know why I waited so long to get the old face fixed," he says. "It's like the doorbell. Everything takes such an effort. I knew plenty of plastic surgeons, but I guess I was afraid they'd make me look like Glynis Johns. En fin, I got up the nerve to get myself patched up here and there. Eyes. Nose. Lip. Had the jaw broken and reset. This was during '66 and '67. I didn't look younger at all. I just looked like a decrepit version of my young self. Which is what I wanted, I think."

We are on the sidewalk now, headed toward Monty's favorite Italian restaurant, Galvani's on Third Avenue. It occurs to me when we have walked a couple of blocks that not one passerby has flashed a look of recognition at the famed actor, although several seedy-looking old men have stopped to wish me good evening.

This anonymity of Monty's is a puzzle. I myself would recognize him in a dark alley with a paper bag over his head. Has the public forgotten him?

"No, no, not at all, mon vieux," he says when I ask. "There are two reasons why people don't notice me." He raises two fingers in front of my face and counts off the reasons as we walk. "The first is, I look so much the way I did thirty years ago that people are inclined to think I just look like Montgomery Clift. Cabbie told me yesterday I could be Clift's double if I weren't so skinny.

"And the second reason is that ... many people think I'm dead. Now, this creates some problems. Some years ago I went to the Academy Awards with Warren Beatty to watch him get Best Actor for Bonnie and Clyde. He had come with me the previous year to see me win for Reflections in a Golden Eye, so I was repaying the favor. He picked up his famous smile from me, you know. Or so he says. Anyway, Butch - I call Warren 'Butch' - Butch and I were about to go in and there were all the photographers and so forth around ... We get to the door and they won't let me in without an invitation. So I give my name and this fellow at the door almost swallows his tongue. He says, 'Oh, ho, you canta foola me.' Like Chico Marx. 'Oh, no, you canta foola me. Montgomery Clift, he'sa dead.' They all think I'm dead. Butch patches things up, and they let us both in. Next day there's mention in the trades that some drunk claiming to be 'the late Montgomery Clift' tried to crash the Academy Awards. Earl Wilson, that complete tool, gets that all fucked-up and says that some low type claiming to be 'the late Monty Clift's lover' tried to sneak in, but was detained by the bouncers, with the able assistance of Warren Beatty. Ungotteswillens, Earl Wilson gets everything wrong. Anyway - look out for the car - that's how the rumor that I was dead got started. I'm always getting confused with Robert Montgomery, too. And Cliff Edwards and Clint Eastwood. Can you believe - Clint Eastwood? Well, we both got our start as cowboys."


He squints through his heavy glasses, one eyebrow cocked ironically. I am reminded of his role as the Ivy Leaguish cowboy in Red River. Clint Eastwood does indeed perform rather like a lower-rent version of Monty's Matthew Garth, now that I think on it. Just as Paul Newman took his usual persona from A Place in the Sun and Jack Nicholson's portrayals remind me - de temps en temps, as Monty would say - of Perce Howland in The Misfits.

I mention all this to Monty, who smiles and does a Gertrude Lawrence: "Everyone acts like someone else. It's dreadfully confusing."

While we wait to be seated at Galvani's I add, "In Invasion of the Body Snatchers Kevin McCarthy acted just like you."
"Better quit while you're ahead, mon vieux."
"Vielle."
"Whatever. Hey, I just had a deja vu. I've been waiting in a restaurant with you before, with a guy sitting at the bar just like that one" (he points to a fat man a few paces away) "and you're looking at me with ... a light ... in your eyes and I say, apropos of something or other, 'Better quit while you're ahead,' or somesuch. Have I ever met you before?"

"Yes," is my reply. I've been dying all afternoon and evening to tell him this. "You met me in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1958, when I was four years old."
"Ah, yes, now I remember. You're the one who didn't want to have her picture taken. Do you still hate broken crayons?"
"Uh-huh."
"So do I."


As we finish our antipasto a middle-aged woman in a pink blouse with a Peter Pan collar, a calf-length green plaid pleated skirt, bobby sox, and brown-and-white saddle shoes appears at our table. She is hyperventilating. "Oooh," she squeals, "it's Monty Clift!" She pushes a grimy autograph book in front of us and demands that Monty sign it.
"'For Esmerelda, with all my love,' if you please, Mr. Clift. . . " Esmerelda giggles.

Monty looks very hard at her.
"Montgomery Clift is dead," he says. "Dead, I tell you!"

A bald man with hairs in his nose approaches and takes the woman by the shoulder: "Come, Cosima, come along. You mustn't bother these nice people. Terribly sorry, folks." He raises a crooked finger to tip his hat, only he isn't wearing a hat. Cosima, or Esmerelda, or whatever her name is, runs back to get her autograph book. I have already signed 'Elizabeth Taylor' and Monty has added, below it, "Robert Taylor."

Studio 54 isn't what it used to be, but then, what is these days? Certainly not me, certainly not Monty. In my Place in the Sun outfit I am immediately admitted, and a kind gentleman ahead of me even does me the favor of paying my couvert. I wait for Monty until, some ten or twelve minutes later, he slips in with a crowd of off-Broadway homosexuals.

"Somebody actually recognized me here a year or so ago," he says. "Hey look, there's Dick Van Patten! Hi, Dick. Dick was in The Skin of Our Teeth with me way back when. Hey, Dick, you're lookin' good, I see you lost more weight!" It turns out that it is not Dick Van Patten after all, but that is okay, because whoever it is disappears into the crowd and is never seen again.

"You say you've been recognized here?" I ask.
"Yeah, about a year ago. A foreigner, hadn't heard that I was dead. She worked on the props for Suddenly, Last Summer. Told me I looked better now than I ever had in my life. You'd recognize her name in an instant if I told you who it was."

As he says this, this obnoxious person from my discussion section at college a couple of years ago suddenly bumps into me and begins to coat me with slobbering kisses. "You look fantastic," says the disgusting person.
I grab Monty and tell him I want to go.

We go. The next morning he is reading the New York Gazette, one of the shorter-lived of the papers born of the newspaper strike, when he suddenly looks up at me and says, "You didn't tell me that was Senator Blahblah's son last night at Studio 54. You should have introduced us."
"Why? Is there something about him in the paper?"
"Yes. He was killed in a hit-and-run on CPW right after we saw him."
"I find that very difficult to believe," I say.
"All I know is what I read in the papers. More coffee?"
"Please."
