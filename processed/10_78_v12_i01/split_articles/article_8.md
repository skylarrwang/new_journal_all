near the track will rarely smile -
a 
dignified nod, maybe, given with the 
inward-turned expression of someone 
coming from communion. A water 
polo game is beginning at the pool. 
Water polo players wear little 
protective caps with what looks like 
ear muffs attached. Before they give 
the team shout and plop into the 
water, they crowd together and thrust 
their hands, fingers spread, in the face 
of an official. ''He's checking their 
fingernails," says the woman next to 
me, who's rooting for Trinity, "so 
they won't scratch." The rhythm of 
the game keeps changing. Sometimes 
the ball whizzes around, sometimes 
the players keep dipping it anxiously 
in the water, looking for a place to 
throw. When the ball is free, one 
player paddles insolently after it while 
an enemy leans on his shoulders and 
shows his hands to prove he's clean. 
Once, someone is taken out and sits 
on the edge, clasping his knees and 
scowling. "He must have done some-
thing underwater," says the woman 
for Trinity. Above, on the track the 
runners are still orbiting noiselessly. 
On the barbell room landing on the 
first floor, Jorge Ualadz is lifting 200 
lbs. Below him people move their 
limbs in slow motion up and down, 
back and forth, lifting weights in the 
blue-green light reflecting off the 
rowing tank on the right. Jorge is a 
graduate student in philosophy, 
studying epistemology. He once lifted 
400 lbs. He says he's been less shy 
since he's been lifting. "I took up 
body building for a while, but I'm just 
not built for it"; he fingers his wrists, 
"Small bones. So I'm going back to 
lifting to try and get my strength 
back." "You could say this is an 
essentially meaningless activity," he 
pauses and looks out over the shirtless 
men pumping methodically at the 
Universal Weight Machines, "But 
then, you know, you give it meaning."

**Title: Doll**

<.~~;-;or 
other dolls. They can 
t.V2-
make a Barbie Breakout: you feed her 
~ 
a malted milk and her face breaks out 
with acne. The only way to get rid of 
the acne is to smear her face with a 
special ointment; squeezing the 
pimples would only make it worse. 
Currently advertised on Saturday 
morning children's television is a doll 
called Baby Wet 'N Rash. Its name is 
self-explanatory. You feed it, it wets, 
and then it develops a rash. The only 
way to get rid of the rash is to smear 
the doll's plastic buttocks with a 
special ointment. It's a wonderful way 
to raise your child to become a 
dermatologist. 

And what about Ken? He shouldn't be 
left out. They can market a Ken doll 
that develops a syphillitic rash on the 
palms of his hands. The only way to 
get rid of it is to keep him away from 
Barbie. Or how about an S&M Barbie 
that develops welts when you whip 
her? Or a Ken that gets psoriasis? 
Here's an unexplored field for 
American enterprise. 
With a little ingenuity, .the doll's 
manufacturers should be able to adapt 

Baby Wet 'N Rash is manufactured 
by Kenner, and sells for about $12.99.
