himself. If his disappearance was 
deliberate, then Sam can make the 
willful decision to return." 

Unfortunately, scant evidence sup-
ports this theory. Friends and teachers 
describe Sam as quiet and stable, not 
someone who would run away on a 
whim. A social activist particularly con-
cerned with the problems of the home-
lesS',• Sam loved his family deeply-too 
deeply to cause them such distress, 
friends say. 

But what if Sam had some secret 
motive for running away? Both the 
Todds and the police have investigated 
this possibility. "I've begun to think of 
this as two different searches," John 
said. "The first, of course, is for Sam 
physically. The other search is for Sam 
mentally. Now we must say we don't 
know this person, because the Sam we 
knew wouldn't disappear." 

The Todd family and the police are 
not the only people who have tried to 
reconstruct Sam's frame of mind at the 
time of his disappearance. Paul Keane, 
YDS '80, recently put together a 
30-page report assessing Sam's emo-
tional condition on that New Year's 
Eve. Keane, a New Haven resident, 
wrote his report as an "unsolicited, 
unauthorized and unacknowledged 
minister to Yale University." According 
to Keane, "The Sam Todd disap-
pearance was a case in which I saw my 
alma mater 
suffering 
from many 
unanswered questions. I saw nobody 
offering any solutions, so I tried to pro-
vide some answers." 

Keane's paper,. entitled "Fugitive 
From God, Country and Yale?: The 
Disappearance of Sam Todd," is based 
on interviews with 40 people, including 
many of Sam's classmates and pro-
fessors at the Divinity School. Other 
than Doris Todd, Sam's aunt, Keane 
did not interview any members of the 
Todd family for reasons of privacy. 

Keane suggested that a combination 
of financial , 
academic, 
social and 
theological pressures impelled Sam to 
run away. "My hunch is that a lot of 
stress accumulated to the point of in-
tolerability in Sam's mind. At the party


"The police tell us that 
if Sam was dead there 
is a very good chance 
we would have heard 
about it by now." 

it got to the point where he just said, 'I 
can't take it any more,' and ran away. 
What happened to him after that, I 
don't know." 

In the report Keane noted that Sam 
was in a difficult financial bind during 
the previous semester. Sam, who re-
ceived little financial support from his 
parents, had to borrow money from his 
aunt to pay his fall tuition. Keane also 
described a meeting in which Sam was 
asked by his landlords to be more timely 
in paying his share of the bills. 

Sam was under intense academic 
pressure at the time of his disap-
pearance, Keane added. According to a 
recent tightening of Divinity School 
regulations, a student could receive a 
failing grade in a course for not com-
pleting work on time. Described by his 
professors as a fair student, Sam may 
have left for Christmas vacation believ-
ing that he had failed two classes. Sam 
might not have been able to complete 
his requirements for graduation in his 
final semester at the Divinity School. 

Moreover, Sam was experiencing 
some social problems during the holi-
day break. Keane quoted Sam's Divini-
ty School classmate Shep Parsons as 
saying that Sam had decided to break 
up with his long-time girlfriend, but 
was having a difficult · time of it. 

Dramatically, that girlfriend showed up 
unexpectedly at the Mulberry Street 
Party on New Year's Eve. "Sam was 
blown away because (his girlfriend) was 
there and he didn't expect it ... Sam 
was trying to get out from under her," 
Parsons told Keane. 

Finally, Keane's report suggested 
that Sam may have been experiencing 
an identity crisis caused by a sense of in-
feriority to his father, a prominent Pres-
byterian minister who once held a 
prestigious position with the World 
Council of Chruches. Keane wrote, 
"Sam was not only walking in his 
father's footsteps, but remaining in his 
father's shadow; and the shadow cast 
from a desk on the World Council of 
Churches was a long shadow indeed." 

According to Keane, Sam's identity 
crisis was so severe that he sought out 
the advice of a Divinity School pro-
fessor. The two had a long discussion 
about the difficulties Sam was having 
reconciling self-interests with 
his 
religious beliefs. Sam expressed doubts 
about his desire to continue his social 
activism. 
"By 
thf! 
middle of 
fall 
semester," 
Keane 
wrote, "there 
is 
evidence that a new feeling, an intruder 
feeling, was creeping into Sam Todd's 
personality, previously so grounded in 
the selflessness of global conceru.: fnr the 
oppressed." 

John Todd read Keane's report but 
was not convinced by it. "Keane puts 
together a lot of things that, when you 
take them out of context, can be used to 
comfort yourself with the idea that they 
explain what may have happened. I just 
wish they presented as strong a story as 
Keane puts together." 

The Reverend George Todd, Sam's 
father, shared John's opinion of Keane's 
report. "If you want to speculate on the 
possibility that Sam left voluntarily, 
then you can put together the kinds of 
things that are in that report. We would 
like to think that the report is right; it's 
the most optimistic scenario. 
But 
weighing all we can find out, it doesn't 
really seem to point substantially in that 
direction." 

Reverend Todd said that Keane's 
report does not contain any information 
that the family didn't already know and 
may in fact contain some inaccuracies. 
"Sam is a very open kind of guy, and so 
various kinds of things in the report, the 
things about completing his coursework 
and not having paid his bill, are things 
we were aware of from the start. There 
wasn't anything that seemed to repre-
sent any extraordinary special kind of
