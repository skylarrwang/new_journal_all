CLERGY STUDENT SOUGHT BY FAMILY 
SAM TODD 
AGE: 24, 5'11", SLIM, 135 lbs., LIGHT BROWN HAIR, BLUE EYES, 
DARK FRAMED GLASSES. 
MAY HAVE LOST MEMORY 
DISAPPEARED JANUARY 1, 1984 IN NEW YORK CITY 
A flier distributed in the area where Sam Todd disappeared. 

determine at least that the sighted per-
son was not Sam. You're almost guar-
anteed to be frustrated in trying to 
determine even that," John said. 

The police have offered three possible 
scenarios 
to explain 
Sam's disap-
pearance. He may have suffered some 
form of amnesia or mental impairment 
which kept him from contacting his 
family. John 
considers this theory 
unlikely. "We've learned from doctors 
and other experts familiar with amnesia 
that people in that condition tend to 
know something is wrong and tend to 
search out help. If Sam had done some-
thing like that, chances are that we 
would have heard about it," he said. 

"Even if Sam were in a more severe 
mentally disheveled state, something 
more like a down and out street person, 
we've done a lot to try to tap into any 
network that deals with such people," 
John added. 

The possibility that Sam is dead- the 
victim of an accident or violence - can-
not be eliminated entirely. But that 
scenario also seems unlikely, John said. 
"The police tell us that if Sam was dead 
there is a very good chance we would 
have heard about it by now; a body 
would have turned up one way or 
another in a short time. Though you 
can never rule that out, it becomes less 
likely with each passing day." 

Ironically, 
the Todd family has 
gained hope from such tragic incidents 
as the discovery of the body in the Hud-
son River. Said John, "There's been a 
grim comfort in stories like that because 
of the undeniable possibility that Sam's 
body would turn up in the Hudson once 
the spring thaw arrived. We were all 
kind of waiting with bated breath to see 
what would happen. But now that's all 
gone by. So then you're left talking 
about much more bizarre and im-
probable circumstances which would 
have resulted in his body just disappear-
ing." 

The police feel that if Sam is neither 
dead nor suffering from amnesia, the 
only remaining explanation is that he 
voluntarily ran away and is now hiding 
somewhere. Sam's family considers this 
the most appealing scenario because, in 
John's words, "It implies that Sam is 
alive and well and able to take care of
