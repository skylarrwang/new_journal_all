TV Cold Turkey 
Benjamin Persky's favorite TV shows 
are "He-Man" and "Mr. 
Rogers' 
Neighborhood," but the six-year-old 
hasn't watched them for a month. Along 
with hundreds of other children and 
adults in Farmington, Connecticut, 
Benjamin vowed to give up television 
for the month of January. He is part of 
an 
experiment 
first 
conducted 
in 
January 1984 and organized by Nancy 
DeSalvo, children's librarian at the Farmington Public Library. Last year 
DeSalvo coaxed over 1000 Farmington 
citizens to turn off their sets and this 
year, she estimates, that number will be 
even higher. 

Dr. Dorothy Singer of the Yale Family Television Research and Consultation 
Center helped DeSalvo organize 
the project, speaking to parents about 
the dangers of irresponsible television 
watching. According to Singer, "We're 
most concerned about the kid for whom 
television is the only contact with the 
outside world, the type of kid who 
spends six hours a day in front of the 
set. There is a surprisingly large 
number of children like that." 

Since 1976 Singer has been at Yale 
studying how television affects young 
children. "Another thing we're looking 
at in Farmington," she added, "is the influence of violence on television, particularly on shows like 'Hill Street 
Blues' and 'Miami Vice.' Adults can sort 
that out from their daily reality, but 
children can't, and they imitate what 
they see." 

DeSalvo plans to keep encouraging 
both parents and children to be more 
selective about what they watch now 
that the experiment has ended. "We're 
not promoting any kind of censorship," 
the librarian said. "The truth is there 
just isn't that much on television worth 
watching." 

Andrea Persky, mother of Benjamin 
and two other young children, agreed 
with DeSalvo. "This is a little like 
dieting," Persky said. "Once you start 
you always have to keep it up or else 
you'll just fall back into your old bad 
habits. My kids had a great time in 
January. They relied on each other for 
entertainment and didn't miss the TV a 
bit."
