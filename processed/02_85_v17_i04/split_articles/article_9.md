EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor: 
We are concerned with the opening 
paragraphs of your article "The Klan 
Comes North"(TNJ, Dec. 7, 1984)and 
their implications. 

We object to the connection made, in 
an otherwise well-researched and informative article, between a specific Yale 
event and KKK activities in Connecticut (" ... this year's vandalism shows 
.the ramifications of an increasing KKK 
presence in Connecticut cannot be 
underestimated.") What is described as 
an "overt act of racism" cannot be fairly 
and fully addressed in such a brief 
Â· opening vignette. Unnecessary fears 
and tensions were created; the article 
implied an increased KKK influence on 
the Yale campus which we feel was unwarranted by the actual events. 

We deplore any act of racism. As 
freshmen counselors our objective is to 
promote understanding among all students at Yale.

Editors Note: We intended to express that 
while some people consider the Klan to be a 
humorous matter, there are several hundred 
residents of our state who do not. As stated in 
our article, "the KKK had nothing directly to 
do with this incident . . . it is unlikely the 
Klan will have much direct impact at Yale. 
We feel our readers deserved coverage of both 
the Yale incident and recent events outside 
New Haven, and we tried to keep the distinctions clear between them.
