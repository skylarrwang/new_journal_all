"When anyone dies 
here, everything hap-
pens very quietly. 
Once the woman in 
the bed next to me 
died and I didn't even 
know it. They don't 
want to excite you." 

Down the hall in the first common 
room, a man who arrived yesterday sits 
surrounded by his two teenage sons, his 
wife and his brother. Perhaps 45 years 
old, he has lost most of his black hair to 
radiation therapy, the crown of his head 
now covered with a fine fuzz. His pa-
jamas look too big for his thin body and 
his beard lends the only fullness to 
his gaunt, olive-colored face. He and 
his family all sit without speaking, his 
son changing the television channel now 
and then. 

Next door in the Commons, the 
largest of three triangular, den-like 
rooms, Rosemary Huerzeler, Connec-
ticut Hospice's Chief Executive Officer, 
watches a volunteer wheel a very old 
woman through the room. Black and 
frail, the patient absently waves her lean 
hand and excuses herself by saying, 
"Evenin'. Just passin' through." 

"Let me make something clear: this is 
not a death house," Huerzeler said, as 
the woman left the room. "People don't 
come here simply to die. The quality of 
life in the final stages is so important, 
and we try to make the suffering 
bearable. There comes a time when you 
hook a patient up to all sorts of medical 
equipment, and although it prolongs 
life, it doesn't make life better." 

The first institution of its kind in 
America, Connecticut Hospice pro-
vides palliative treatment to the term-
inally ill, mitigating their pain without 
trying to cure their diseases. In the final 
stages of a fatal illness, most often 
cancer, Hospice patients have left 
behind the numerous operations, the 
' â€¢ 
chemotherapy, the radiation treatments 
of hospitals. They have found instead a 
program which gives them power over 
everything from their bath time to their 
medication. Through a unique team-
care approach, the Hospice comforts 
both patient and family through illness 
and eventual death. 

In 
the sixties a 
powerful dis-
satisfaction with traditional handling of 
the 
dying developed among both 
laymen and professionals. "After some 
point treatment is useless, hurtful," said 
Professor of Public 
Health John 
Thompson, a member of the Hospice's 
Board of Directors. "The care should be 
pain relief; they should be allowed to die 
in peace. The dying shouldn't be kept in 
hospitals, pumped up with all those 
damned drugs, because it just can't do 
any good anymore." 

Frustrated with the accepted treat-
ments, former Yale School of Nursing 
Dean Florence Wald, pediatrician Mor-
ris Wessel, oncologist Ira Goldenberg 
and others responded to the British 
hospice movement. In 1971 Wald and 
her colleagues incorporated the non-
profit, non-sectarian Connecticut 
Hospice. Three years later, 
with 
government grants and an eight-person 
staff on Prospect Street, the Hospice 
began to provide home care for the ter-
minally ill. Then, in 1980, with the 
directors ready to offer care beyond the 
city, the Hospice settled in a new, 
44-bed inpatient facility in Branford. 

Even with this building, home care 
remains the Hospice's emphasis. In
