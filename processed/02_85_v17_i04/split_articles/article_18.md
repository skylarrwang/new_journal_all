moving toward a balance at Yale. "I told 
my roommate, 'Please introduct> me to 
your friends.' I want to feel part of Yale. 
People form groups so quickly that it's 
hard to break in- I was afraid," she ex-
plained, looking down at her clenched 
hands. "I want to become involved in 
non-Jewish activities too, but I don't 
want to feel that what I'm doing now 
isn't valid or doesn't count." 
David Henkin, BR '87, is perhaps 
the best example of an Orthodox Jew 
who is what Ponet calls "committed to 
living in two worlds and able to reach 
beyond himself." Henkin, the grandson 
of a rabbi and the son of a Columbia 
professor, grew up on Manhattan's Up-
per West Side. On Friday nights he 
moves with ease between a gathering of 
observant J ewish students and an en-
tryway party, stopping only to place his 
Rabbi James Ponet in his office.

While most observant Jews stringent-
ly try to follow the 613 Biblical com-
mandments (known as mitzvot) intended 
to guide them through life, Henkin's 
brand of Orthodoxy stands apart from 
most. H e feels maintenance of an obser-
vant lifestyle is not entirely dependent 
on a belief in God. "I'm not sure I have 
that belief," he said without hesitation. 
"I'm not quite sure of the reasons for my 
observance. When you're brought up to 
believe in God, even when you can't say 
'I think there is a God,' you find 
yourself proceeding with •the assump-
tion that there is." 

While most of Henkin's closest 
friends are not observantJews, Kitchen 
members usually share overlapping 
social groups. In fact many members 
joined the 
Kitchen 
first 
semester 
freshman year, choosing rarely to ex-
perience the pandemonium of Com-
mons or a residential college dining 
hall. The Orthodox way of life here 
creates the need to draw together, to 
form a secure, interdependent com-
munity. But this structured lifestyle also 
gives rise to a feeling of separatism, 
creating a sense of insularity within the 
community. "The Kitchen keeps people 
10ut and it keeps people in. It provides 
for those who are doing real, kosher 
Judaism," said Henkin. "It's the Young 
Israel House and that strangeness keeps 
people away. Students go there and use 
it either as a crutch or as an asylum 
from dealing with Yale. Yale is not 
always easy to deal with, particularly 
for people from homogeneous back-
grounds." 

Mimi Hasson, TC '85, regrets join-
ing the Kitchen early freshman year. 
When she applied to Yale from an Or-
thodox high school in Chicago, her 
teachers told her to go to Barnard or 
Harvard, since Yale had "absolutely no 
observant community." "I was very 
afraid of the Commons' atmosphere 
when I arrived," she explained, embar-
rassed by her statement. "But eventual-
ly the fear went away and I became 
more involved in Yale." For the first 
time in her life, Hasson was exposed to 
flexible branches of Judaism which ac-
cept liturgical and ritual changes. She 
now considers herself no longer an Or-
thodox but a Conservative J ew. She 
plans to obtain a University dining hall 
contract, with the option of eating at the 
Kitchen only twice a week. This is not 
easy for Hasson to admit, because 
deciding to leave the Kitchen can be li~e 
abandoning one's own family. Hes•-
tating, she explained, "My perception 
of the world has been altered. I've 
discovered a lot I didn't know existed." 

For Atara Siegman, SY '85, the 
Kosher Kitchen became and remains a 
home. Comfortable with her Judaism, 
her belief in God and her commitment 
to Orthodoxy, A tara is warm and ap-
proachable. "I know people who have 
great friends in their colleges but don't 
feel a sense of community," she said,

pushing her curly brown hair away 
from her eyes. Suddenly she smiled. "At 
the Kitchen people really care, "'•hich 
matters at Yale where religion becomes 
a very private, internal expression. 
What I do isn't ancient custom or just 
historical commemoration. 
It has 
relevance in the modern world. I'm part 
of a tradition that has meaning for me 
too." 

For women who are observant Jews, 
however, living in a world enlightened 
by modern feminism may present con-
flicts. Among other restrictions, women 
are barred from the rabbinate, not 
counted in a minyan (a group of ten) for 
prayer and not called to read the Torah 
in the syna~ogue. "V\'omen and men are 
just seen as intrinsically different," 
Siegman suggested, "but that doesn't 
mean they must exist in two separate 
worlds. I believe I can maintain my self-
respect as an observant jewish woman." 

M any O rthodox find needed support 
from religious students of other faiths. 
Throughout. her four 
years 
in 
Saybrook, Siegman has lived with 
similarly religious women, includmg a 
devout Catholic. "It'!> comforting to 
know there's someone else in the 
Uni"ersity with related morals, ethics 
and values, who doesn't hold to the 
secular world totally," Siegman said. 

Andy Weinstein, DC '86, is perhaps 
one of the Kitchen's most unusual 
members. Although he would not 
hesitate to agree today with Siegman's 
enthusiasm for Orthodox practice, a 
year ago he might have argued. Once a 
non-religious Jew, he has now made the 
transition to Orthodoxy. Weinstein 
grew up in a non-observant family but 
one in which he always felt a strong 
Jewish awareness. "I had no conception 
of Orthodox Judaism," Weinstein 
remembered. "I thought it was obscure, 
a dying, irrelevant lifestyle. I always 
cared I was a Jew, though, and was 
aware I would defend my Judaism." 

Freshman year Weinstein had no in-
tention of exploring Yale's J ewish com-
munity. 
Uninterested 
H illel, 
unaware of the existence of the Kosher 
Kitchen, he had what he called "a 
distaste for Jewish socializing." As a 
sophomore W einstein took Anthony 
Appiah's 
philosophy 
course, 
"Language, Mind and World" and 
began to explore what was for him a 
new realm of thought. "We read Wit-
tgenstein, who is concerned with curing 
people from philosophy; he cured me in
