Overcoming Alcohol 
Lei ia Wardwell 
Susan just celebrated an important an-
niversary, marking a year and a half of 
a new life. It is a date she considers 
more important than her birthday, 
because 18 months ago she gave up 
drinking. Susan is an undergraduate at 
Yale, and she is a recovered alcoholic. 
Seven percent of adult Americans 
have a drinking problem. Surveys con-
ducted on college campuses estimate 16 
percent of the 75 percent to 95 percent 
of students who drink are problem 
drinkers or alcoholics. "We can't deter-
mine exactly what the percentage is at 
Yale," said Maureen Flanagan, director 
of Student Medicine at University 
Health Services (UHS), "but I'd guess it 
is similar to the national statistic." If so, 
then about 700 of the almost 5200 
undergraduates at Yale could be prob-
lem drinkers. 

Susan developed a physical addiction 
to alcohol after she began drinking in 
high school, and the disease progressed 
as she continued the pattern at Yale. 
10 The New JournaUFebruary 1, 1985 
After her freshman year she came to 
terms with her illness and sought treat-
ment, 
which 
required eliminating 
alcohol from her life completely. 
"People drink to stand out or to fit 
in," Susan said, explaining the attrac-
tion drinking first had for her. "Also 
there is a standard here- students ap-
plaud and encourage outrageous be-
havior. One night freshman year I got 
drunk and danced on the roof of my 
dorm with a friend. People congratu-
lated me the next day, saying, 'You were 
great last night. • I liked having the 
reputation of working hard on 
weekdays and going wild on weekends." 
She also pointed out that women often 
start drinking because they believe 
alcohol will make them more comfor-
table with men, and if they ever lost 
control of a situation, they could easily 
explain away their guilt and embarrass-
ment. "So many times I've heard 
women talk to each other about their 
dates-one will ask, 'Did you sleep with 
him?'and the other will say, 'Yes, but I 
was drunk.' 
"I also began to get involved in van· 
dalism and adventure," Susan said. 
"Once I stole some things from a library 
, here with a 
friend, and I don't 
remember doing it. The next day I 
returned them with an anonymous let· 
ter of apology. At first I didn't connect 
this kind of thing with drinking, but 
then I began to realize something was 
wrong." 

Heavy drinking at Yale poses a 
serious problem because it so often 
relates to incidents of violence, sexual 
harassment, vandalism and medical 
danger. "The University as a whole suf-
fers the consequences of alcohol abuse," 
Ezra Stiles Master Heinrich von 
Staden said, "because more accidents 
and dangerous situations than most know 
result from it." 

Masters and health officials face a 
challenge in identifying students who 
abuse alcohol habitually. "We don't 
generally find out about the students 
with real problems," Branford Master 
l John Merriman said. "I don't tend to 
~ hear much from the freshman coun· 
~ selors about them." Many chronic 
! drinkers manage to hide their habits 
~ behind success and popularity. "There 
~ is the alcoholic who doesn't think he's 
~ having a problem- he's getting good 
~ grades, he has lots of friends, he's young 
j and healthy- so he's not aware of the 
damage done by the four or five drinks 
he'll have every night," Flanagan said. 
"He has to recognize he's in trouble first 
before he'll come in for help." 

Susan could not keep her drinking 
problem secret for long. Friends and 
roommates caught on and began to talk 
to her, asking her to cut down or find 
help. Usually Susan ignored this ad· 
vice, annoyed when others who "didn't 
understand" tried to teU her what to do. 
"In the end it was my roommate who 
got me to find help," she said. "She was

was before is dead, 
but really she's only a 
sip away." 
very hard on me. She told me she was 
disgusted in me and she doubted I could 
ever stop drinking. It was the shock 
technique-quite a change from the ap-
proval or mild concern I was getting 
from everyone else." Susan talked to 
someone at UHS, who sent her to 
Alcoholics Anonymous. U H S has no 
specialist on alcoholism and in such 
cases provides physical examinations, 
medical 
information and 
referrals. 
"Usually, by the time students come 
here they are already in a great deal of 
trouble," Flanagan said. "The number 
we see is not an indicator for the degree 
of alcoholism on campus." 

Susan stopped drinking through the 
AA treatment program. She felt it was 
the best program for alcoholism but 
admitted some students might have 
trouble 
accepting 
its 
format 
and 
philosophy. Those who come from 
sheltered backgrounds may feel reluc-
tant to discuss their personal problems 
with people from all parts of society, she 
said. Frequently alcoholism is all these 
people have in common, and the idea of 
making a deep commitment to this kind 
of group can intimidate students. "AA's 
life philosophy is not always consistent 
with the Yale student's," Susan ex-
plained. "It takes a one-day-at-a-time 
approach, while most students are 
thinking in long-range terms. 
"The great thing about AA is its un-
conditional love. It is a terrific support 
group. I remember the day I got my 
first chip, which some chapters award to 
Participants for every three months and 
then for every year they have been 
sober. I walked up before this huge 
group and received it while everyone 
applauded. I realized I was a good per~ 
son- a strong person- and all these 
people were on my side. AA is the 
reason I haven't had a drink in a year 
and a half." 

While Susan struggled to give up 
drinking, she encountered further dif-
ficulties readjusting to social life at Yale 
without alcohol. "I had some trouble 
with my friends, especially those I used 
to drink with," she said. "I used to have 
a great rapport with one of my suite-
mates freshman year, but not since I 
stopped. It's very hard to realize alcohol 
was all you had in common with some 
of your friends. Some gave me a hard 
time for staying sober, by insulting me 
into drinking again. I praised myself for 
stopping. Friends would say I was mak-
ing it up. 'We had hoped you would be 
comfortable enough with yourself to 
drink again,' they would tell me." Susan 
admitted she didn't go to many parties, 
mostly because all the drunk people 
around disgusted her. "It was hard for 
me to give up this dominant part of 
Yale life. I guess it's not as much 'fun' as 
before, without all the extreme highs 
and lows. I'm. glad the person I was 
before is dead, but really she's only a sip 
away." 

Susan is grateful for her Yale ex-
perience, despite the trouble she had 
with its emphasis on alcohol. "The 
drinking environment is intense at 
Yale," Susan said, "and it gave me a 
chance to drink hard and fast at a low 
price. I'm glad I'm here, though, be-
cause I got the chance to discover, and 
then overcome, alcoholism at an early 
age." 

Susan 
is 
fortunate 
because she 
stopped a process which might have 
ruined her life later on. She may have 
her experience at Yale to thank. If the 
social environment 
here 
overem-
pi-..-:-;izes liquor and leads to alcohol 
abuse, it also often forces students to 
learn the hard way about the dangers of 
heavy drinking. Perhaps such a learn-
ing process is necessary within a society 
that 
features 
alcohol 
almost 
everywhere, but it is not successful and 
beneficial for everyone. "Drinking at 
Yale can be a useful experience for 
students who learn quickly and 
painlessly," von Staden said, "but for 
those who don't, it can be one of the 
most dangerous and destructive be-
cause it may lead to habits which can 
destroy their magnificent potential. Not 
everyone learns successfully how to 
drink moderately."

Each year von Staden holds panel 
discussions for Stiles students with Yale 
alumni from the class of'53. Usually the 
panels provide advice and information 
about professional careers. Last fall, the 
three guests talked about their ex-
periences with alcoholism. All three 
were alcoholics themselves and over-
came the illness only after it had severely 
damaged their careers and families. 
"Two of the three attributed the start of 
their drinking habits to their experience
