professional failure. Nonetheless, others 
still have difficulty with several aspects 
of hospice care, particularly drug treat-
ment. At the Hospice, 40 percent of the 
patients enter experiencing terrible 
pain, but once there they are medicated 
around the clock, remaining alert but 
never feeling the onset of pain. Some 
medical professionals fear this method 
could lead to drug addiction, but 
Huerzeler denies it. "No one can get ad-
dicted because, frankly, the patients 
don't have enough time to. When we 
take them off a medication, we never 
see withdrawal signs," she said. "There 
is a real difference between taking drugs 
to feel comfortable and taking them to 
blot out the world." 

According to Mangual, hospice pro-
grams are opening at a rate of one a 
week across the country. Currently, 
1,100 
hospice programs exist 
in 
America, although most, unlike the 
Connecticut Hospice, are either entire-
ly home care programs or sections of 
hospitals. Yet the Hospice in Branford 
has been instrumental in the creation of 
many of these programs, not only 
because it serves as a model for the 
others, but for its teaching institute, 
which operates every spring. Con-
ducted by doctors, nurses and other 
Hospice staffers, the institute helps 
organizations develop their own hospice 
programs. 

Perhaps hospice care has become so 
successful because it is far less expensive 
than hospital treatment. Palliative care 
settings have no use for all the medical 
machinery which keep the comatose 
alive, and so the cost of care for the pa-
tient remains relatively low. Yet after 
the insurance and Medicare payments, 
the Hospice still does not break even, 
relying heavily on philanthropy for sur-
vival. New federal regulations may 
slow the growth· of the hospice move-
ment. The laws cut the daily payment 
hospices receive for the care of their ill 
and force patients to give up future 
curative treatment upon entering a 
palliative program. When the laws were 
enacted in 1983, it was clear the 
Hospice couldn't operate under them, 
but it quickly and luckily received a

waiver from the regulations by being 
declared the national demonstration 
hospice. 

Despite occasional setbacks, Huer-
zeler and others feel palliation will 
grow, reaching beyond the treatment of 
cancer patients to other illnesses and 
areas of health care. Recently, the Con-
necticut Hospice faced the difficult deci-
sion of admitting AIDS victims to its in-
patient facility. The Board of Directors 
agreed to admit AIDS patients provid-
ed they met the regular admission 
criteria. Although the Hospice later 
received two referrals, one patient 
changed his mind and the other still has 
more than six months to live. 

Other hospices, such as the one at 
San Francisco General Hospital, do ad-
mit AIDS patients on a regular basis. 
The Connecticut Hospice continues. 
however, to prepare 
its facility to 
treat AIDS sufferers. "The difficulty is 
that it is a communicable illness," 
Hurzeler said. "We have to take certain 
precautions to contain it, precautions 
which aren't in place yet. It has to be 
safe for both the patient and the rest 
of the Hospice." 

As debates over patient rights grow 
more heated, the terminally ill around 
New Haven continue to join the Hos-
pice program. Despite the controversies 
in legislatures and medical schools, the 
men and women of the Hospice focus 
their attention on the last weeks of their 
patients' lives. Free of respirators and 
life-support machines, the Hospice of-
fers only comfort to those who cannot 
be cured. 

Everyone entering the Connecticut 
Hospice passes by a gold-lettered in-
scription on the wall. 
Written by 
Reverend Ed Dobihal, one of the 
founders, the few sentences remind 
visitors they have arrived in a place of 
life: 

• 
For all gifts and gittrs 
For hope and for caring 
For now and foreur 
Thonks bt to all.
