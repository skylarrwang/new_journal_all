at an early age." 
wards, and the group's support and 
warmth greatly impressed me. I kept 
running into people from that first 
meeting, and I was amazed how friend-
ly and caring they were to me. In the 
end, though I decided I had enough 
faith in myself to do it alone. 
"I had some trouble with my friends 
at first," Paul said, "especially those who 
may have felt threatened by my deci-
sion. I feel much better about my 
friendships now, without all the guilt 
and uncertainty I felt while I was drink-
ing." Paul avoids parties for many of the 
same reasons Susan does. 
"I get 
especially annoyed 
when 
there 
is 
nothing to drink but alcohol," he said. 
The prevalence of alcohol in Yale's 
social life is something Paul and Susan 
will always encounter. Most likely they 
won't go to many Feb Club parties this 
month, and they won't participate in 
many Yale traditions which supposedly 
make college fun . These traditions have 
probably led to destructive habits for 
some students, though at first the drink-
ing rituals on singing group tap night, 
the cups at Mory's and the qua.ners 
games at any local bar seem only festive 
and harmless. 
Such traditions will persist regard-
less of official policies and frequent 
changes in the drinking age, and 
alcoholism will continue to be a prob-
lem among Yale students. "We don't 
understand exactly how alcoholism 
develops- whether it's genetic or en-
vironmental- but it 
not the 
alcoholic's fault," Flanagan said. "He 
has to take the responsibility, though, to 
recover by stopping, just as we all have 
to take the responsibility to learn about 
the dangers of alcohol abuse early on. 
Alcoholism touches everyone's life here, 
and there is no one perfect solution."
