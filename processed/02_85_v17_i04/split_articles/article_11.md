Joe Levy's article "It's Only Rock and Roll" (TN], Dec. 7, 1984) described 
the band Singing Beach. The photos accompanying the article depicted the 
band The Whales from New London, 
led by To Benoit '82, on bass guitar. 

The Whales have 
released two 
singles on Orcabeat Records: "Buddy 
Lovers" and "Talk About the Weather."
