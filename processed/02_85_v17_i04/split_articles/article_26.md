deal with the family in privacy, let alone 
having to deal with the public as a 
whole. So, we made a conscious deci-
sion to let things cool off as much as 
possible in the hope that when things 
were not so focused on Sam he might be 
a little more willing to come back. So 
far, that hope has been unfounded." 

Although the search does not receive 
as much press attention as it once did, 
possible sightings continue 
to 
be 
reported almost on a weekly basis. One 
such incident occurred this New Year's 
Eve, exactly one year after Sam's disap-
pearance. Doris Todd received a phone 
call from the New York City Police; 
they had a street person in their office 
who seemed to match Sam's descrip-
tion. H oping that the family's search 
would reach a miraculous conclusion 
one year after it began, Doris rushed to 
the police station. She immediately 
realized, however, that the young 
vagrant was not Sam. As the dejected 
Doris Todd was leaving the office, the 
young man turned to a policeman and 
innocently asked, "Well, am I Sam or 
aren't I?" 

"That really brought home to all of us 
the seriousness of the situation of a lot of 
people out there in the streets," John 
Todd said. "They are 'missing' in a 
much deeper sense than Sam. They 
don't even have someone to tell them 
who they are." 

According to john, the Todds' deter-
mination to find Sam remains strong. 
"You have to keep doing something in 
order to preserve your own peace of 
mind. There's always that lingering 
feeling that if only you could reach out a 
little bit more vou could touch Sam in 
some way and (naybe bring him home." 

j ohn is planning a one-day reunion of 
Sam's searchers to take place in New 
York City later this month. This gather-
ing, John said, will be a "fellowship of 
faith. It will provide an opportunity for 
us to keep the h9pe of Sam, rather than 
the memory of Sam. alive."
