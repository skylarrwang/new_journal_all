EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Hillel offices are literally located in 
basements, most of Yale's Jews also 
maintain a very low profile. 

T here has not always been a signifi-
cant Orthodox population at Yale. Ac-
cording to Hillel's Ponet, as recently as 
1962 a Jewish admissions quota of ten 
percent maximum still existed here. Yet 
since the mid-sixties, there has been a 
consistent increase in the Yale J ewish 
population, with the Orthodox com-
munity also growing in strength and 
numbers. Ponet, who as far as he knows 
is the first Yale graduate to become a 
rabbi, remembered, "Across the nation, 
there was a feeling of normality in being 
a J ew. But when I was a student here, 
some anti-Semitism still existed. Yale 
was a place somewhat new to jews, and 
we grew to think being jewish was pret-
ty weird." He paused to answer the 
phone, speaking to the caller in H ebrew 
while jotting down a note in English. 
M inutes later he finished his thought, 
undaunted by the interruption. "Today, 
although 30 percent of Yale students are 
J ews, we're not Yale in some deep way." 

Three fundamental changes have oc-
curred during the last decade enabling 
the Orthodox jew to attend Yale: a bla-
tant anti-Semitic atmosphere no longer 
prevails; an increased number of O r-
thodox Americans can afford a Yale 
education; and the possibility of obtain-
ing kosher food has become a reality. 

M oreover, Ponet commented, "There's 
a new attitude toward pluralism in this 
country. Ethnic identities are 'in.' Yale 
has been forced to deal with its well-
deserved image as an anti-Semitic 
school with a gentile attitude." 

D avid Ruderman, DUS of Judaic 
Studies, hopes that the growth of his 
program will ameliorate past problems. 
As part of the new $7.4 million develop-
ment 
campaign, 
four 
new Judaic 
Stud ies professorships were initiated 
this year, as well as two new chairs in 
Hebrew Language and Literature and 
in M odern J ewish 
H istory. "Until 
several years ago Yale was delinquent in 
getting involved," 
R uderman said. 
"Yale is not a white, Protestant school 
any longer. T here are Jews who are in-
terested in their own heritage." 

"What I do isn't an-
cient custom or just 
historical com-
memoration. It has 
relevance in the 
modem world." 

Attempting to counter further the 
"basement mentality," Rabbi Ponet has 
begun a $5 m illion development pro-
gram for building what he calls a 
"Center for Jewish Life at Yale," to be 
located at 35 High Street. The complex 
will include a kosher dining hall, a 
synagogue, offices for both Hillel a nd 
affiliate organizations and the R abbi's 
home. 

Reactions to the proposal for a jewish 
Center have been generally supportive, 
though not without some reservations. 
Some older alumni maintain fears of 
separatism. "Jews were excluded from 
the Yale community long enough. 
Don't recreate the ghetto and take us 
out of the mainstream," one alumnus 
said. Students express concern that the 
Center will not establish new social con-
texts for K itchen members who feel 
alienated. Some students believe that 
Hillel and the Kitchen should remain 
separate, clearly defined structures. 
Others fear that the building will re-
main empty and unused. Many hope, 
however, that a new complex will be 
more palatable to Yale Jews than the 
Kitchen is now. "It will seem less of an 
enclave of fanatics and more like a 
Jewish cultural center," H enkin said. "It 
doesn't have to be an intimidating Or-
thodox bastion," Weinstein said in 
regard to the Center. "Now we dovm 
(pray) in basements. To be visible 
would help all Jews at Yale." 

Weinstein intends to wear a y armulkL 
on campus this semester. When asked if 
he feels he's missing the "real Yale ex-
perience" as an Orthodox Jew, he just 
laughed and said, "People put too much 
stock in modern everything. I don't 
think the most important things have 
changed so much ." H e paused. "It's im-
portant to confront people with their 
own backgrounds. It's too easy to slip 
through the cracks here . . . I don't 
want to make it easy for anyone to 
forget he's a j ew." Surrounded by thick 
poles and painted pipes, Weinstein 
placed his prayerbook aside before 
beginning to eat.
