Marjorie Schlaijker looked glum as she 
stood in the front hall of University 
Career Services one January afternoon, 
staring at a wall full of job descriptions. 
"I get a stomachache," she remarked, 
"every time I come here." 

Schlaijker had been reading the des-
criptions for a while, but nothing looked 
promising. There were a lot of banking 
jobs. There were a lot of jobs for com-
puter science and electrical engineering 
majors. There were a lot of jobs she 
couldn't identify but which sounded 
lousy anyway. 

Waving her pen around, Schlaijker, 
a history major, said, "I'm writing down 
everything that says 'all majors.'" 
"Look at this- this sounds 
intriguing," she continued, brightening. 
"American Express Travel Related Ser-
vices. It sounds perfect- you get to 
travel." 

She made a note on her growing list. 
"I am never going to get a job," she 

In high school, there was college; in col-
lege, there are jobs. Worrying about 
college was nothing compared to this. It 
is true that there are jobs out there, lots 
of them, jobs in banks, in bars, in Ber-
muda; jobs as paralegals, paratroopers, 
and paramedics; as zookeepers and 
xylophone players and toll collectors 
and doctors. 

They're there, but you have to get 
them. 

Many of the more than 150 seniors 
who attend the Morgan Stanley 
informational meeting in November 
wished that they could get a job with 
Morgan . Stanley. They concentrated 
hard as representatives of the invest-
ment bank showed slides, and discussed 
mergers and acquisitions, corporate 
bonds, equities, tax-exempt securities 
and money markets. They took notes 
on earth-colored notepads. After the 
presentation some crowded around the 
Morgan Stanley representatives, asking 
questions and perhaps hoping to be 
remembered. 

"How many hours a week can we ex-
8 Tbe New JournaJ/February 1, 1985 
pect to work at Morgan Stanley?" asked 
one senior. 

"None," answered a classmate, who 
was eating little sandwiches and drink-
ing wine in the back of the room. 

"Oh, about 60 to 80," said the ex-
ecutive, smiling. Several people put on 
their coats and walked out. 

But the audience looked happy when 
the executive said 
that six Yale 
graduates "came aboard" at Morgan 
Stanley the year befqre. AI Puhala, an 
'83 Yale graduate who works at Morgan 
Stanley, showed slides of new employ-
ees falling asleep at computer terminals 
and dancing on top of their desks. 

"We have a good time at Morgan 
Stanley," he said. 

Scott Edelman, who was not paying 
all that much attention, noted that he 
had sold chicken fingers door-to-door 
on Long Island the summer before-
chicken fingers similar to the ones they 
were serving at the meeting. Luckily, 
Edelman never had to pull his chicken 
fingers connection; he got into law 
school soon afterwards. 

UCS (University Career Services) 
should not be called CAPS (Career Ad-
visory and 
Placement Services) 
anymore, even though no one seems to 
realize it. Located at 1 Hillhouse, next 
to the language lab, UCS provides 
seniors with a large amount of informa-
tion and advice, conducting strategy 
meetings on everything from choosing a 
career to interviewing for employment. 

UCS Director Susan Hauser, her two 
associate directors, five assistant direc-
tors and eleven staff members could 
not be more helpful. Many students, 
however, feel lost in the shuffle. 

"I don't understand how to read the 
information sheets," Sareet Majumdar 

"The computer listings they have 
posted are really hard to read," Anne 
Wilson said. "The print is so small-
and they're all jammed together." 

Another senior said it was difficult to 
figure out when and where all the 
) 
various information meetings are held. 

"I tried to go to a meeting with some 
company the other day, and I ended up 
wandering into all these janitor closets 
and empty storerooms in the basement 
ofUCS. I said, 'Right, they're really go-
ing to hire me if I can't even find a sim-
ple room.' 

"It turned out that the meeting had 
been canceled, and that it was the 
wrong company in the first place." 

Most of the approximately 170 com-
panies that recruit at UCS are banks 
and other financial organizations, and 
this dismays some seniors- those whose 
college careers have leaned heavily 
toward 18th-century English poetry 
classes, for example. 

"I just read an article about how 
materialistic college students are," said 
Lauren Bober, who was thumbing 
through a book on employment in the 
media in the UCS library one after-
noon. "But you can see why, if all the 
opportunities for interviewing are with 
investment banks." 

Bob Broeksmit, who was about to 
turn in his resume to several companies 
recruiting through UCS, compared a 
banking career to the history major: 
"It's easiest to get herded that way," he 
said. "I sort of figured I'd be put into the 
investment banking frame of mind by 
now. 

"But," he went on, "a lot of skills you 
learn at Yale overlap. If you can figure 
out what Milton meant in a passage, 
you can figure out what Texaco meant 
in their annual report." 

Broeksmit said he had always been 
interested in business and 
money 
management. He is lucky. A lot ofpeo· 
pie have no idea what they're interested 
in and did not know what to do this 
Christmas, when hordes of noisy adults 
appro~ched them with the inevitable 
.question: "So, what are you going to do 
next year?" 

There are many responses to this, in· 
eluding, "That's a good question," and 
"Nothing," but many seniors said they

were afraid to reply this way- especially 
if their parents were nearby. 

Parents are get ting worried. 

"My mom keeps wanting me to write 
to all these people and ask them for 
favors, even when I don't like what they 
do," one senior said. 

"I hac;! lunch with a friend of my dad's 
at Mory's the other day," Erik Kulleseia 
said. "'and we chatted about the in-
suran<.<. busi nes~ . ., 

"He said it was a good field to go into, 
because it was full of mediocre people 
and you could rise to the top quickly." 

Thinking about insurance, Kulleseid 
smiled. 

Lily Zimmermann said that after she 
told her mother she was interested in 
advertising, her mother introduced her 
to an advertiser at a cocktail party. 

. "I didn't know what to ask him," Zim-
mermann recalled. "So I leaned over ~nd 
said, 'So, tell me everything about 
advertising.' 

"He said there were plenty of oppor-
tunities for a bright young gal like me. 
'Why,' he said, 'my secretary went to 
Smith, and she got herself a good hus-
band.'" 

Dealing with adults is bad eno·•gh; 
dealing with peers can be worse. They 
won't admit it, but many seniors can't 
~die it when their friends get jobs or 
mterviews before they do. 

"People are definitely feeling around 
to see who got what," said Anne 
Wilson, who had just been asked to in-
terview at several companies. 

A former Daily News editor, when 
told that a colleague had been offered a 
reporting job, said, "Ah, shit." She was 
thrilled, she added, but noted that it 
meant one less job opportunity for her. 

Chris Wilkinson, however, seemed 
P~ud that he had failed to get an inter-
VIew with First 'Boston Bank. "They 
g~ve it to everyone else," he said, grin-
nmg, "except for me. 

"I also got rejected from a scholarship 
that I hadn't applied to. In fact, I'd 
never even heard of it." 

For many seniors, the job hunt started 
on December 14, the deadline for ap-
plying to the first batch of companies 
prescreening for on-campus interviews. 
Prescreening can be thought of as a pro-
cess by which seniors give their resumes 
to companies who then reject them. 

If December 14 had had its own 
slogan, it would have been "pick a job, 
any job." A lot of people waiting in the 
long line outside Room 208, where the 
company folders were kept, did not 
seem to know what they were doing. 

"What's Kidder Peabody?" Allegra 
Bowers 
asked, 
as her companion 
surveyed the crowd and observed, 
"Wow, I know everyone here." 

Some students say they submitted 
resumes to companies they'd never 
heard of, on the theory that it doesn't 
hurt to keep all your options open. 

"I 
wanted to cover the bases," 
Kulleseid said with conviction, explain-
ing why he had given his resume to a 
number of banks, even though nothing 
in his past would indicate a particularly 
strong affinity for banking. He wavered 
when pressed about specifics, like, did 
he really want to be a banker? 

"I'll 
probably end up- I 
don't 
know-these are good starter jobs.'' His 
voice began to fade away. He clutched 
tightly at his stack of resumes. 

The job listing printout, which contains 
over 150 job descriptions and is updated 
every week, is the focal point of the 
UCS front hallway. Often, crowds of 
students jockey for position in that 
hallway, seeking the right job. Many 
are overwhelmed by all the information 
and write nothing down; others say that 
it's hard to get excited about jobs when 
you don't know what their titles mean. 

"There's not a single company here 
that I want to work for," said Elisabeth 
Malkin, who had just read the entire 
list. 

Two men observed that it would be 
kind of.neat to work for the CIA. The 
Agency security check would probably 
take about six months, they decided, 
but it would be worth it. They wrote it 
down. 

"Bloomingdale's?" someone mut-
tered. "'Who the hell wants to work for 
Bloomingdale's?" 

A woman exclaimed: "Oh my god, I 
missed the Lehman Brothers deadline!" 

"Now that I'm here, do I get a job?"· 
asked a senior who had just arrived, ob-
viously for the first time. Everyone 
within earshot giggled. 

Meanwhile, Marjorie Schlaijker hal:i 
found the perfect job. "I'm going to 
apply where there's no competition," 
she said, pointing to her noteboo1t. ·She 
had written down the name of a televi-
sion station in North Pole, Alaska.
