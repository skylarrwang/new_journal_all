Sophomore Sawyer 
TD sophomore Eric Berg walked to 
center stage. Standing before the empty 
theater, he spoke the words of Mark 
Twain. Several weeks later Berg heard 
that he had won the part of Tom 
Sawyer in a production of The Adventures 
of Huckleberry 
Finn, 
opening 
this 
February at Chicago's Goodman 
Theater . 
. Berg had played Huck Finn during 
hagh school in an adaptation of Stewert 
Gordon's original play. Berg's director, 
Robert Greenberg, discovered that 
Gordon was planning a revival and sug· 
gested Eric as a possibility for Huck. He 
a~ditioned in October, and a phone call 
nght after Thanksgiving break brought 
Berg the good news. 
•r was ecstatic because I had to wait six 
~eek~ to hear," he said. "It didn't fully 
smk m until January, when rehearsals 
started." Scheduled 
to 
run 
from 
F~bruary 4th to March 3rd, the play 
waU be an ensemble production similar 
to Nicholas Nickleby. In addition to the 
role of Tom, Berg will have five or six 
other parts, including understudy for 
Huck. The revival commemorates the 
tenth anniversary of the original show 
and the tOOth of the publication of 
Twain's novel. 

Having done several plays in high 
school and such productions as The 
T'!'JfJtst, 
God and De~ and Twelfth 
Naght here at Yale, Berg is no stranger 
t? the stage. While he intends to audi-
tion for other professional shows, he 
lees theater more as a special interest, 
not a career plan. "~'ve got some friends 
who are professional actors, and it's 
tough when they're out of work." He 
paused, then answered, "I'll probably be 
an Econ.-Poli. Sci. major."

**Title: Elm City Rollers**

Elm City Rollers 
When they rolled out of the past and 
onto the streets last November, the 
three trolley cars caught the attention of 
many New Haveners. The trolleys 
transported passengers as a trial run 
for 
a 
new shuttle system 
being 
developed by the Downtown Council, 
an organization comprising many local 
businesses. 

According to Jack Sullivan, Project 
Manager for the new shuttle system , 
the Council thinks the system will 
benefit both public and private in-
terests and will contribute to the 
revitalization of New Haven. Citizens 
seem to agree. Of the 600 question-
naires returned, "The worst comment 
\-\<as-'lt's good.'" SuUavan said. 

Called "The Elm City Line," the 
system has three possible routes: a retail 
loop 
connecting shopping malls, 
businesses, theaters and hospitals; a 
harbor route allowmg access to the new 
Long Wharf complex; and routes con· 
necting downtown with parking areas. 
The shuttle should alleviate downtown 
parking problems and move customers 
closer to the business districts. 

Sullivan sees the system as benefit· 
ting the Yale community as well. "I 
think 
that 
the shuttle would tie 
students in with different parts of the 
city, such as the Long Wharf, which 
they don't have access to now," Sullivan 
said. 

The original trolley cars appeared in 
New Haven around the turn of the 
century and continued to operate until , 
buses replaced them in the early 1950s. 
These trolleys, however, are motorized 
and do not use the tracks required by 
their predecessors. If the Downtown 
Council's plans continue as scheduled, 
the sound of a clanging beiJ and the call 
of a conductor will once again become 
familiar sounds to New Haveners.
