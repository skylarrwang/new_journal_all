Within Two Worlds 
Tamar Lehrich 
T he block letters engraved on the out-
side of the Georgian-style brick building 
proclaim from the Book of John, "I am 
the way, the truth, and the life." Above 
the archway hangs the message, "Come 
Unto Me," from the Book of Matthew. 
These quotes from the New Testament 
are the sole reminders of the period 
when the building served as the New 
Haven soup kitchen. This unimposing 
structure at 305 r.rown Street now 
holds the Young Israel House at Yale, 
more commonly known as the Kosher 
Kitchen. 
Once inside, walk down a flight of 
stairs, open the heavy door to your left, 
and you'll find the Kitchen itself. The 
walls are a drab off-white and the 
carpeting is faded and worn. Thin cur-
tains do not completely hide the iron 
bars covering every window. With thick 
poles and painted pipes, the room 
seems like an average family basement. 
On the walls hang posters of Israel as 
well as charts which explain various 
religious rituals. At each of the ten long 
tables is a vase of flowers on a white 
tablecloth. As people sit down to eat, 
they immediately introduce themselves, 
and for the visitor, the feeling of being a 
stranger soon disappears. 

In many ways Orthodox J udaism at 
Yale centers around the Kosher Kit-
chen. Founded 25 years ago by a group 
of Yale laY( students, this student-run 
cooperative now has 35 members. 
Through the Kitchen and the sense of 
community it creates, a life of tradi-
tional J ewish observance can be main-
tained. Students choosing this lifestyle 
have joined the growing number of 
American Orthodox Jews. 
Many Yale students are unaware of 
the Orthodox community's very ex-
istence here, not to mention the Or-
thodox way of life. For most students 
Saturdays may mean waking at noon, 
watching TV or studying in CCL. Yet 
for the Orthodox, the Sabbath, called 
both Shabbat (Hebrew) and Shabbos (Yid-
dish), is dramatically different. Begin-
ning late Friday afternoon, the next 24 
hours include religious services and 
prayer, meals at the Kitchen, topical 
forums at Rabbi Jim Ponet's home and 
informal gatherings in students' rooms. 
No one works or travels on Shabbat. No 
one turns on lights or stereos. Orthodox 
Jews carry nothing- not knapsacks, 
books, keys or wallets. T hey use no 
money. They neither read nor write. 
Even the phone goes unanswered. 
There are eleven days a year in which 
basically identical observance takes 
place. If these holy days fall consecutive 
to Shabbat, an observant j ew will not on-
ly miss classes for three days but will be 
unable to do any academic work. 
Even during the week observance re-
quires sacrifice. To remain kosher while 
eating dinner at Commons, one can 
only have a salad, a cold sandwich or a 
piece of fruit. Most Orthodox won't eat 
cooked or heated foods prepared in a 
non-kosher kitchen with non-kosher 
utensils. Three times a day one prays. 
Some men wear ritual prayer garb, 
which includes tqillin, a network of 
small leather straps and boxes contain-
ing Biblical parchment which affirms 
the unity of God, and zizit, a fringed 
vest which is the reminder of the Com· 
mandments and the presence of God. 
During prayer the yarmulke is also worn, 
a traditional way of showing respect. 
Men who wear a yarmulke at all times 
consider themselves always in the 
presence of God. 
Many observant Jews never stop feel-
ing estranged from the college com-
munity as a whole. Feelings of isolation, 
insularity and detachment exist among 
the Orthodox here. While determined 
to make their orthodoxy uncompromis-
ing, 
some feel 
deeply 
ambivalent 
about taking on the double life Yale im-
poses. They are students struggling to 
balance 
the 
secular 
present with 
religious tradition, trying to collapse the 
boundaries of these two worlds. 
During freshman year Yonina Hel-
man, JE '87, found most social activities 
were organized on Shabbat. "I thought 
everyone else was becoming 'a real 
Yalie' while I remained on the outside," 
she explained. "I didn't want to admit to 
myself that I was different. Finally I just 
decided I could never erase whatever 
made me different. I know rd never be 
the kind of person people read about in 
the Daily News. • Helman, whose father 
is an ordained rabbi, has been Or-
thodox since birth. She lived in both 
Israel and Egypt, attended Orthodox 
day schools and deferred Yale for a year 
to attend Jerusalem College 
for 
Women. 
Like many observant J ews, H elman 
never had to question the relevance of 
her observancy before coming to Yale. 
The daily ritual and routine so foreign 
to other Yale students were an inherent 
part of her life. Helman never had a 
non-Jewish friend, and once at Yale she 
did not think any9ne outside the Kosher 
Kitchen knew she existed. "I think a lot 
of people here are against any kind of 
religious observance," Helman said 
frankly. "I felt I was on the defensive, 
guilcy for not answering the phone or 
turning ofT the lights on SIUJbbos. I felt 
uncomfortable going to Commons or to 
any place that didn't have kosher food, 
even getting a soda at Naples. During 
the holidays in September when most 
people were getting up to go to class, I 
was getting dressed up to go to religious 
services. I felt very alienated and 
alone." 
Now very active in Hillel and treas-
urer of the Kitchen, Helman feels she is 
"Finally I just decided I 
could never erase 
whatever made me 
different."
