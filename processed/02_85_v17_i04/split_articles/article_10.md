**Grounds for Repair**
**Author: Gary Lavorgna**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

I enjoyed Rich Blow's article on the 
residential college buildings and the sad 
state of their deterioration ("Yale's 
Decaying Colleges, TN], December, 
1984). To me, such terminology as 
"deferred 
maintenance" 
means no 
maintenance. I might also point out 
that as the buildings have become run 
down, so have the grounds. 

I have worked at Yale for ten years. 
During that time I have seen our groundskeepers' crew cut from 15 people to 10. One of our best senior 
groundskeepers takes care of the Art 
Gallery and Trumbull, 
Saybrook, 
Branford and Jonathan Edwards Colleges- singlehandedly! 

It is 
a 
monumental task simply to get the 
basics done. 

The lawns in all the colleges are in 
various states of neglect and deterioration. Each spring they are renovated for 
Commencement only to decline during 
the long, hot summer because of inadequate irrigation. The only areas that 
manage to survive are the ones where 
automatic sprinkler systems have been 
installed. 

The grounds maintenance budget 
has been so severely cut that often we 
have to work with equipment which is 
so old replacement parts are no longer 
available. 

Lack of preventive 
maintenance results in more frequent 
and costlier breakdowns. We have only 
two top-notch mechanics to maintain all 
the power equipment and vehicles in 
the science and central areas. 

I'm glad to see the college buildings 
being considered for renovation and 
refurbishing. I'd also be very happy to 
see the same attention focused on the 
grounds. The only hope seems to be 
better management of the limited 
resources that we all have to learn to 
live with and the hiring of more 
qualified and skilled professional 
groundskeepers.
