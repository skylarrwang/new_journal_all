Haven, the home care program serves 
approximately 40 to 50 patients at a 
given time. In both inpatient and home 
care, patients are treated by a care-
giving team consisting of doctors, 
nurses, clergy, a social worker and a 
pharmacologist. The efforts of these dif-
ferent professionals attend to all of a pa-
tient's needs- physical, emotional, 
spiritual, even legal. Hospitals, visiting 
nurse agencies and doctors all refer pa-
tients to the Hospice. The criteria for 
admission into both programs are 
similar: terminal illness, six months or 
less to live (as determined by the refer-
ring physician), consent and aid of the 
physician and of course the consent of 
the patient. 

"With home care, the patient is 
assured someone will always be there. 
They can whistle away at five a.m. and 
someone will come," Huerzeler said. 
"The team from Hospice keeps the 
home life a balanced, well-controlled 
environment, because you don't want to 
wear the family out. 

"Half our patients die at home, but at 
some point, a family just can't handle 
the strain any more. One woman whose 
son died at home last year has been 
haunted by the memory of the hearse 
pulling up to the house ever since. So this 
year when her father was dying, she had 
him in here for the last 16 hours of 
his life. It enabled her to cope." 

Physicians direct patients to the in-
patient facility when their medical 
needs, particularly the management of 
pain, can no longer be met at home. 
Carved from a tract of surburbia, the 
low structure appears to be a cluster of 
greenhouses. 

Every feature of the 
building has a purpose: the glass walls 
in corridors and common rooms let in 
sun and darkness, giving some dis-
oriented patients a sense of time; the 
four-person suites allow patients to 
develop friendships at a difficult time; 
the big color TV s, plants and couches 
make common rooms look like dens. 

The Charlie Mills Preschool, 
operated by the Hospice, shares the first 
floor. 

Originally created 
for 
staff 
children, the day care center is now 
used largely by Branford citizens. 

Allowed to take phonebooks to the pa-
tients every year and do other small er-
rands occasionally, the children be :orne 
aware people around them are sick and 
perhaps dying. Huerzeler believes 
children and patients benefit from this 
exposure. "Someone once said 'Where 
children play it must be safe," she 
said. "When a patient is brought in ly-
ing on a stretcher, the sight of the kids 
inspires a confidence no signs or 
touches can." 

In 1983 the Hospice inpatient facility 
treated 
approximately 400 
patients 
from the greater New Haven area as 
well as from out of state. Although 15 
percent were discharged, most died 
within 
three 
weeks 
of admission. 
Depending upon the stage of the illness, 
patients arrive in different conditions: 
some are alert, others confused and a 
few comatose. Although a team of pro-
fessionals see to their total well-being, 
patients have great authority over their 
remaining weeks. Lillian Nichols, a pa-
tient, explained, "Here, we're the boss. 
They ask you if you want to take a bath, 
you get to visit whomever you want 
around here, you even get to wear your 
own clothes. Since I've been here, I 
have gotten a really nice idea of 
Hospice. Before, my husband was tak-
ing care of me alone. He used to be up 
all hours of the night, which was a 
strain on him because he's diabetic." 

After a long period of illness began 
last September, N ichols' doctor referred 
her to the Hospice a month ago. In and 
out of Yale-New Haven ten times since 
1978, the 83-year-old patient has had 
double mastectomies, a spleen removal 
and blood infections. She sits near her 
bed, dressed in a flannel nightgown 
with a pink and white knitted vest over 
it. Her hands on her lap, she twists her 
gold weddin~ band.

Differing from a hospital intensive care 
unitÂ·, the Hospice does not confine pa-
tients to their beds day and night. The 
Hospice employs an arts director who 
brings in entertainers or works with pa-
tients individually on crafts. Often pa-
tients sit with their visitors in a common 
room watching television and talking. 

Nichols has improved since arriving 
at the H ospice and hopes to return 
home in a few weeks. Behind her left 
shoulder, a woman lies asleep in a par-
tially raised bed, her jaw fallen, her 
mouth open. Nichols worries about her 
roommate, the fact that she sleeps all 
day, waking up occasionally to look 
around the room. Nichols realizes her 
suitemate may die soon, yet the thought 
does not frighten her. "When anyone 
dies here, everything happens very 
quietly. Once the woman in the bed 
next to me died and I didn't even know 
it. They don't want to excite you," she 
said. "There are no machines to keep 
you alive, nothing false, just natural." 

Although most hospitals focus only 
on the patient during treatment, the 
Connecticut Hospice believes the families 
of the terminally ill need great support, 
particularly near the end. Families may 
visit any time and aJI members, even 
small children and pets, are welcome. 
"In the building are several rooms called 
'nooks and crannies,' which have sofas, 
cribs and televisions. When relatives 
visit from far or the family wants to 
spend the night with a patient near 
death, they can use these rooms," said 
Gloria Mangual, Assistant Public Infor-
mation Director. Family can use the 
kitchens in the common rooms to 
prepare a favorite dish, or the laundry 
room in the basement for wash. Most 
important, the caregiving teams at the 
Hospice keep in close contact with the 
families of the patients. Doctors and 
nurses not only give health reports, but 
provide emotional support as well. 

When a patient dies, the family can 
spend time alone with the deceased 
before the hearse arrives. Often the 
body is taken to the second floor view-
ing room, which is actually two. long 
joined rooms, one dimly lit with a couch 
and table and the other with the patient's 
bed. The room shows the Hospice's 
concern for the smallest details in help-
ing people face death. Placed diagonally 
across from the door of the sitting room, 
the bed stands at the greatest distance from 
anyone who enters the actual viewing 
room. The space gives the survivor 
time to approach, to realize his relative 
has just died. 

To help families cope after death, the 
Hospice maintains a 
bereavement 
counselling service. Consisting of a 
volunteer team and a professional co-
ordinator, the service saw half the 
families linked to both inpatient and 
home care in 1983. The counselors 
decide which families need face-to-face 
attention based on considerations such 
as children, the health of the spouse or 
the possibility of alcoholism developing 
in the family. A volunteer visits the sur-
vivors and periodically sends letters ex-
plaining they have someone who will 
listen to their recollections and help 
them with new problems. On Memorial 
Day and a Christmas weekend, the 
Hospice invites the families of the past 
year's deceased 
a 
meal and 
memorial service in Branford. The 
Hospice provides counselling as long as 
the family wishes, although after six 
months most have learned to go on with 
their lives. 

Nurse Kathy De Almo, evening shift 
supervisor, enters the Commons and 
~its near Huerzeler. After working five 
years in hospitals, DeAlmo realized she 
wanted to practice the ideals of nursing 
which she learned in school. She wanted 
to care for only a few patients and felt 
the need to include the family in all 
aspects of care. The Hospice nursing 
system is based on the Intensive Care 
Unit method, with three nursing shifts 
covering 24 hours and very high nurse-
patient ratios. For every Licensed Prac-
tical Nurse there are three patients, and 
for each Registered Nurse who runs the 
nursing teams for patients there are 
five. 

Because of these high ratios, nurses 
often grow close to their patients. Yet
