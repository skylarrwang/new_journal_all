The article was hidden deep inside The 
New York Times' metropolitan section; it 
was the kind of story you probably 
wouldn't even notice unless you were 
looking for it. But John Todd noticed it 
-he had been looking for such an arti-
cle for several months. 

"Body 
Found 
In 
Suitcase 
Hudson," the headline read. On July 
22, 1984, a woman fishing in the Hud-
son River near the George Washington 
Bridge hooked onto something very 
heavy. With some help from a fellow 
fisherman she reeled in the object, 
which turned out to be a large suitcase. 
Inside were the decomposed remains of 
a young man. He was dressed in a 
sweatshirt, jeans and running shoes. 

From the description of the Hudson 
victim, John suspected that he had 
finally found his 25-year-old brother 
Sam, a Yale Divinity School (YDS) stu-
dent who had disappeared in New York 
City on January 1, 1984. Sam had 
vanished in Greenwich Village, just a 
few blocks from the Hudson River. 

John knew that if Sam had been 
murdered, his body might eventually 
resurface in the Hudson. 

John soon learned, however, that the 
Hudson victim wasn't Sam. The body 
was identified by the police as another 
of the thousands of people reported 
missing in New York City every year. 
For John the sighting was just one more 
false lead in the search for his brother. 

"We really know nothing more than we 
did the first day Sam disappeared," 
26 The New Journal/February 1, 1985 
John said with a sigh. "None of the 
many possible sightings we have had 
were substantial enough so that we 
could say that they were conclusive 
evidence that Sam is out there and 
alive." 

It has been more than a year since 
Sam Todd disappeared after leaving a 
New Year's party at a friend's apart-
ment on Mulberry Street. Sam had told 
his younger brother Adam that he need-
ed to get some fresh air to sober up. 
Dressed only in a sweatshirt and jeans, 
having left his coat and wallet in the 
apartment, Sam began to jog up 
Mulberry towards Houston Street. 

About two hours later when Sam 
still had not returned, Adam began to 
look for his brother. The following day 
the Todd family, assisted by scores of 
friends and detectives from the New 
York City Police Department, mounted 
an extensive search for Sam. Nearly 
200 volunteers, many of them from 
YDS, scoured the streets of New York. 
They distributed thousands of posters of 
Sam and searched all of the city's 
hospitals, soup kitchens and shelters. 

The local media quickly caught wind of 
the search and devoted substantial 
coverage to the effort. By March, with 
Sam still missing and no solid leads, the 
Todd family extended their search na-
tionally. They sent letters and posters 
describing Sam to hospitals, churches 
and community groups throughout the 
country. But now, after 13 months of 
fruitless searching, Sam's whereabouts 
remain an absolute mystery. Many 
theories have been proposed which 
might explain his disappearance, in-
cluding a complex hypothesis offered by 
a YDS graduate, but none have proved 
correct so far. 

This uncertainty, the continued lack 
of substantial evidence regarding Sam's 
status, frustrates all who are involved in 
the search. Detective Sergeant Marcia 
Stanton of the New York Police's 
Bureau of Missing Persons has des-
cribed the Todd case as one of the most 
interesting and baffling of her career. 
"We don't know where he is, or even if 
he is alive or dead," she said. "What 
makes it so difficult to grasp for anyone 
involved is that the mind seeks certain-
ty." 

John Todd, a 30-year-old law clerk, 
has been emotionally consumed by the 
search for his brother. "I spent the first 
three months just getting up every day 
and banging my head against the wall. 
There's an immense frustration that 
goes with that type of intensity because 
you think that by putting out so much 
energy you'll get some return for it. But 
in this case, there's none. Absolutely 
nothing. 

"The other thing that drains you is 
the emotional rollercoaster you get on 
when somebody calls and says they 
think they've seen Sam. When that hap-
pens now, a sense of fatigue over-
whelms me. I keep telling myself that 
it's nothing. But you have to do 
everything in your power to try to
