Look! Movie Weird! 
"What did you think of the last Hentai?" 
asks a voice from the corner of the room. Before 
anyone has a chance to answer this curious 
question, another query is made, "How about 
Ranma Â½ Number 34?" Soon the 
room is awash in arcane references 
to Magic Knight Rayearth, Slay-
ers, and Ah! My Goddess. 

The group is 90 per-
cent male and rather 
enthused. I am trying 
my best to fit in. 

About 50 under-
grads and a 
smattering of 
6 
graduate students are gathered at the door to 
Silliflicks, a cozy theatre in the basement of Silli-
man. They are here for the bi-weekly screening 
of the Yale Anime Film Society. The previous 
group still hasn't left the theatre, and insists 
upon seeing the end of their film right up to the 
last few credits. Despite their growing restless-
ness, the anime vanguard is not an aggressive 
bunch, and they let the movie watchers have 
their way. 

One of the members notices that I'm a tad 
lost and flashes me a little grin. Hopeful, I try to 
strike up a conversation. Scrambling to find 
something to say, I mutter something innocu-
ous along the lines of, "Tonight's Japanimation 
looks pretty cool." He knows at once that I'm 
not among the initiated. Those who know call 
it anime and pronounce the word "anime." A 
genre of Japanese animation, anime plot lines 
encompass everything from innocent kid's sto-
ries akin to the Care Bears, to more adult sce-
narios more along the lines of Debbie Does Dallas. As the members of the society will have you 
know, much of this stuff isn't for kids. 

As the theater opens, the bleary-eyed movie-
goers slowly diffuse out of the room. Since there 
are far fewer chairs than people, the anime 
watchers jostle to get prime seats. There seems to 
be a definite hierarchy, with the anime intelli-
gentsia sitting in the chairs up at the front. I sit 
cross-legged on the cold floor hunched up 
against the wall. Near the front of the room, but 
far off to the side, I have a very oblique view of 
the screen and have to strain my neck to see the 
subtitles. One of the Anime Society leaders 
stands up to introduce the video we are about to 
watch, The Vision of Escaflowne. He mentions 
the "superb quality of animation" and the "cool 
storyline." He also tells us that tonight we have 
the rare treat of viewing six consecutive episodes. 
I resent my position on the floor even more. 

The first episode opens with achingly sappy 
theme music and a number of still shots 
of an attractive girl with long 
brown hair and doe-like 
eyes. The girl 
sings something 
in Japanese and 
the subtitles for 
the lyrics come up as 
"Go for love, go for love!" 
The audience is transfixed. 
What follows is a bit of a 
muddle involving 
other things, a Japanese public school, a magical 
pendant, a high school track meet, a crush on 
an older man, an alternate reality, a lecherous 
brown monster, a handsome blond prince, a 
playfully sexy cat-girl, and lots of big robots. 

In subsequent videos I make a concerted 
effort to follow the plot line. In Slayers I witness 
the awe-inspiring magic of a new heroine, Lina 
Inverse. At the beginning of the episode, this 
luscious freedom fighter proclaims, "Anyone 
who's jealous of my power and my beauty won't 
get away!" Chastened, her enemy replies, "You 
got balls, kid, of course, being a girl, you have no 
balls!" The room erupts in hoots of laughter. 
Unsure of how to react, I smile sheepishly and 
scratch my goatee. When Lina's blond heart-
throb, Gourry, decides to flee the evil dragon, 
brave Lina cuts him down to size with her 
acidic wit, "BAD! Gourry, mummy men aren't 
my type." I turn to the person sitting beside me, 
and ask why the heroine is called Lina Inverse. 
He gives me a puzzled look, as if I just asked 
"Why do people breathe?" or "Why do you 
watch anime?" Obviously, I'm missing some-
thing here. 

After three videos, I am a little dizzy and 
can no longer feel my legs. I decide to sneak out 
the back door and get some fresh air in the Silli-
man courtyard. I think to myself, "Not safe! 
Must flee." I know how Lina would react to my 
cowardice. She would toss back her hair seduc-
tively, square her shoulders, look me in the eye, 
and proclaim, "Mummy men aren't my type!"

From Dust to Dust 
The Sterling Memorial Library stacks: no 
other Yale building inspires such dread, such 
intrigue and such romance among students. 
Privacy is easier to find than that elusive history 
or psychology tome. Despite the recent library 
renovations which have left the stacks in 
even greater disarray, the shelves still 
hold some surprises. A look at one 
shelf reveals a set of Shakespeare, 
printed in London in 1757. (George 
Washington was fighting for the 
British, and Connecticut Hall had 
just been built.) On another shelf, 
14 volumes of Chaucer printed in 
Edinburgh in 1782 (each small 
enough to fit in a pocket). The 
sleepy security guards at the main 
desk would never notice. A fan
