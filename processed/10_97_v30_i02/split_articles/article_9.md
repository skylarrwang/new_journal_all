Running Late 
For most of us exercising is drudgery: slowly-
moving half-hours wedded to a machine that 
forces us to move our legs up and down or long 
minutes spent under a bench press trying to 
expand the muscles above our ribs. To combat 
our boredom, fitness fads will continue to come 
and go. There isn't just this year's clothes, there's 
this year's way of getting into them. Thus 
jazzercise emerged, then Buns of Steel, and now 
two Silliman roommates have found a new way 
of avoiding workout doldrums: running in 
New Haven after-hours, long after the Yale 
Police advise staying indoors. 

They come out after midnight, sometimes 
after 1 a.m. Mila wears a pair of orange boxer 
shorts and an old T-shirt, Annie appears in a 
more sophisticated running outfit, her high 
school gym shorts. They look like normal stu-
dents on their way to burning a couple of calo-
ries, but they're not heading to the weight 
room. Tonight's route takes them around the 
periphery of campus, down Chapel Street, huff-
ing and maybe wheezing since they also smoke. 
They invoke an image of weirdness like hybrid 
tomatoes in a transportable garden. 

Running so late is ideal, they say, because 
the weather is perfect and there are fewer people 
on the street. They aren't embarrassed to be seen 
running but are attracted by the desolation that 
fills the streets at night. According to Annie, "I 
see my workouts as romantic in the original 
sense of the word—when I'm running I enter 
into my own zone." For Mila a sense of privacy 
is important as well. "It's just a rest from people. 
College is exasperatingly full of people. But 
most people study at night." The recovery of 
primordial loneliness is just one of the advan-
tages of their unique workout routine. More 
likely they cannot get up in the morning and 
run at night because that's when they're awake. 

In talking to these girls something else 
emerges about their workouts—a sense of 
bemusement with their own oddity. It seems as 
if they're not so much generally in awe of night 
as they are in piquing interest, in creating a cult 
of themselves. As they're running down Crown 
Street when the rest of the world is considering 
sleep, rather than pass them by, they seem to

want us to stop and think, "What are those girls 
up to?" 

Despite their façade of ambivalence, one 
continues to wonder if these women ever feel 
genuinely scared, especially when one considers 
that Mila or Annie often runs alone. According 
to Annie, "Never—I took model mugging 
classes in high school. I know how to defend 
myself." Mila, though, has occasional moments 
of fear. "When I get too far away from campus I 
start to feel uncomfortable. Like sometimes I've 
been alone and cut through the Green to get 
home faster—that made me feel a bit queasy." 
But has she ever met anyone threatening? "No, 
when people have stopped us, it's been because 
they thought we were crazy, not because they 
wanted to hurt us. Like this one time this guy I 
know asked me what I was doing, and I said 
working out, and he said, 'Are you crazy? Do 
you want to get yourself killed?' But I just 
laughed about that." Annie remembers being 
stopped by a man on a bike on Dwight Street as 
she was running towards Whalley. "I don't want 
to be rude," he said, "but this is kind of a dan-
gerous neighborhood." "Thanks," Annie 
replied. "I think we're okay. He was sort of 
weird." Jogging under the street lamps, they 
slyly mock their spectators; all the rest of us hur-
rying home on such dark, unquiet streets.
