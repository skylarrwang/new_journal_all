T'S ALL ABOUT MONEY. IT's HARD PAYING TAXES AND HARD TO CON-
vince the taxpayers that the government is spending taxes on the 
right things or the right people. But it's never been easy being 
poor, making decisions based on your next meal. And it's even 
harder if you're disabled, or if you have children, or if you've been 
addicted, or incarcerated, or abused. We know vaguely that welfare is 
being cut, but who is being affected and how? 

'Every little bit helps' 
"When I first carne here to Columbus House, I wanted to get on 
my feet, get a job, but it just didn't work out that way. I don't know 
what I woulda done without this place," Wtlhamena tells me. 

Wtlhamena's face is wise; her hard eyes indicate she's a veteran of 
poverty. Through the years, she's been homeless, a single mother, and 
an inmate. Wtlhamena, 44, battles alcoholism and Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD), a minor mental illness which is caused by trau-
ma earlier in life. She sits across a table from me at the shelter, affixing 
safety pins to the metal backs of buttons. She earns $4 per thousand 
buttons, netting her $25 each week. The work may seem like exploita-
tion, but in her position Wllhamena is glad to be doing something pro-
ductive. She sighs as she attaches another pin, "Every little bit helps." 

The Columbus House dining room smells like cigarettes and cafe-
teria food. It's grungy and public, much like a church soup kitchen. 

Most of the homeless clients leave in the morning; the mentally dis-
abled who remain now stare at the television or talk to one another. 

"I've been through several treatment programs, I've recovered and 
relapsed. I've been on welfare. Past year I lived on the streets of New 
Haven." Each day she takes two buses from her apartment in Westville 
to Columbus House up in the Hill neighborhood. 

Mental illness often appears concurrently with long term addiction, 
and a life of poverty and addiction often creates mental disorders. 

According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, 20 to 25 per-
cent of the homeless have severe, persistent mental illness. 

PTSD makes Wtlhamena irritable, prone to depression, and moody. 
Combined with her alcoholism, she is barely employable and at times 
too volatile to statt a job. Three years ago, based on the condition of dual 
disability, Wllhamena would have easily been eligible to receive Social 
Security Insurance (SSI), commonly called "disability." Single individuals 
on SSI receive $548 per month. Since SSI reforms were passed, minor 
PTSD and alcoholism are not debilitating conditions which qualify for 
benefits. 

"Disability is being defined more narrowly by the stare," says 
Gretchen Mrozinski, entitlements coordinator ~t the Connecticut 
Mental Health Center. This reform leaves a large segment of the dis-
abled population with both little hope of a monthly check and poor job 
prospects. Those who petition for SSI face the ironic task of staying 
afloat with a few hundred dollars of standard benefits while trying to 
prove to the system that they cannot work. The process of proving a 
disability has always been long, but with more stringent rules the task is 
even more dillicult, requiring ten months or more of doctor's appoint-
ments, legal consultation, and paperwork. 


Without substantial monthly checks, Wtlhamena is pulling her life 
together only with the help of Columbus House case managers. Under
