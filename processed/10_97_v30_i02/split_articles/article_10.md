Donut Abundance 
My suspicions were true. "Old people like 
the French Crullers best," said Leah Beabout, 
recent emigre to New Haven and current 
employee at the Park Street Dunkin' Donuts. It 
seems so obvious: their wonderful blend of air 
and dough, emptiness and substantial weight 
correspond well to the elderly's fragile, yet hefty 
condition. 

Leah freely gave out this information as 
though it were a donut handed out free of 
charge. Indeed, Dunkin' Donuts offered just 
such a promotional give-away a few short weeks 
ago in honor of Fred the Baker, the company's 
retiring ad-man, famous for his catchphrase, 
"Time to make the donuts." However, if I had 
come in earlier dressed not in my Levi's and 
green Gap plaid, but in blue seersuckers and a 
red polo, Leah would perhaps have refrained 
from so readily exposing this Dunkin' Donuts 
lemon-jelly-like inner secret. On that "hellish, 
long-ass shift" when Leah and her co-worker 
Eva handed out one free donut after another, 
she soon realized that some customers were 
returning, dressed anew in hopes of attaining a 
prized second free donut. 

To what extremes will New Havenites go 
for donuts? Did these conniving, unlawful citi-
zens not realize they easily could have fulfilled 
their gluttonous wishes by other, simpler 
means? Had these dastardly deceivers carefully 
executed their plan, they could have come 
home with not one but eight free donuts, with-
out a trip to the changing room. Ah, the poor 
fools, ignorant of New Haven's Dunkin' 
Donuts abundance. 

The relatively young students of the Yale 
School of Drama, like the geriatric, often enjoy 
the French Crullers found at the Park Street 
Dunkin' Donuts. As Leah explains, they enjoy 
French Crullers not for their potential medici-
nal qualities, but simply because they come 
from France (home to Racine and sometimes 
Beckett). Luckily for these students, 
the new Dunkin' Donuts 
sits directly behind their 
York Street theatre 
space. It's likely that 
these drama students 
may never have had the 
opportunity to taste a 
French Cruller, seeing 
that before the new fran-
chise's opening in Septem-
ber, only seven other 
Dunkin' Donuts existed in 
the Yale area: one behind 
Timothy Dwight College 
on Whitney; one 
on Church Street across from 
the Chapel Square Mall; one 
near the Medical 
5 

School Co-op on York Street; one on Chapel 
adjacent to New Haven Book and Video; one on 
State Street; and finally, Union Station houses 
two—count 'em two—Dunkin' Donuts due to 
the overwhelming rush-hour demand for 
portable baked goods. One might rightfully 
ask, "How can these eight Dunkin' Donuts 
adequately serve Yale and the greater New 
Haven community?" (For now, let us ignore the 
additional 20 Dunkin' Donuts listed in the 
New Haven phone book.) In fact, this question 
must have entered the mind of one Mr. Vinny 
Gagliardi, owner and founder of the new Park 
Street shop. This capitalist savior stepped up to 
the plate at the hour of Yale's greatest need. 

Leah reports that the new shop's most intense 
hours of donut demand are early in the morn-
ing and from about 2 to 3 p.m. 

This leads me to wonder at precisely what 
time the severely intoxicated man and his equal-
ly drunk mother entered the store, ordered one 
Bow-tie, and then asked for whipped cream to 
be spread all over it. Leah did not speculate as to 
who these two inebriated saps might have been. 
I suspect the handiwork of two over-imagina-
tive drama students, out for a night on the 
town. I also wonder at what ungodly hour the 
stabbed-in-the-wrist-bleeding-all-over-the-
counter man barged in and took plenty of 
Dunkin' Donuts napkins to heal his wound. 
Unfortunately, this latter man chose to be 
knifed near the wrong Dunkin' Donuts, for had 
he been hankerin' for a Blueberry Crumb down 
on York Street, he would have been but a few 
feet from good medical attention. He must 
have been one of the same guys who returned 
for that extra free donut.
