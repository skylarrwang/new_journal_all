The clock is ticking. With autumn waning and winter 
imminent, the City of New Haven has only a few weeks left to 
live up to its promise of finding a replacement site for the 
Crown Street Overflow Shelter which provided 75 beds for · 
single homeless men. 

For years, the city leased a building on 353 Crown Street 
from November through March to serve as an overflow space 
for the Immanuel Baptist Shelter, which has consistently 
turned away homeless men during the winter months. This 
spring, the building on Crown Street was put up for sale by its 
owner who could no longer afford to lease it to the city for just 
a fraction of the year. The city declined offers to buy the build-
ing, and it was purchased by Yale to expand its art and archi-
tecmre space. Yale made the city aware of the purchase well 
before the deal was closed and the city in response made a 
promise to find a replacement for the Crown Street Shelter. 

The city, however, has not yet fulfilled that pledge. "We 
need closure this month," says Alma Ayala, the human 
resources administrator for New Haven. "We have two sites 
that look promising and we have the vendor who would oper-
ate the program. There is also a fallback that we're working on." 

But vague answers like this concern We The People, a· New 
Haven activist group made up of homeless and formerly 
homeless individuals. "They're wasting their time," says 
Andrew Levels, a representative of the group. He also com-
ments on the city's request late last summer for We The Peo-
ple's assistance in searching for a site. "We're not paid to look. 
It's the city's responsibility," Levels says. 

The request is perhaps indicative of the problematic task 
that Ayala and other city officials face. "It is difficult to lease 
because the sites we are considering are temporary," Ayala says. 

Dismayed by the city's lack of a solution, students in the 
Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project (YHHAP) 
mobilized student supporters and made the need for a shelter 
space an issue in the city. YHHAP members Deborah Dinner 
(CC '98), Nicky Tuchinda (MC '99), Rebecca Charnas (MC 
'98), and Karen McFadden (BR '98) sent a letter to Mayor 
John DeStefano in which they declared it "imperative that the 
city fulfill its responsibilities by acting immediately to ensure 
that a permanent overflow shelter is running by November 1." 

The letter was signed by city activist groups and local organi-
zations as well as businesses on Church and Chapel Streets and 
various student organizations. 

These organizations know that the city has already exhibit-
ed commitment to its homeless. The city's "no-freeze" policy 
states that once temperatures drop below freezing, shelters can-
not turn away homeless individuals. There is hope this season 
that the city will prove consistent in its commirmem. ~ut with 
an ever-increasing number of homeless men wandering the 
streets and only 113 shelter beds available, time is running out.
