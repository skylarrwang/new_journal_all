Nightfall transforms our surroundings. The 
naruraJ darkness of the night and the isolated 
man-made lights that punctuate: this darkness 
suggest uneasiness, adventure, mystery and soli-
tude. I walk through urban and suburban spaces 
searching for evidences of life. The spaces I pho-
tograph are used spaces-backyards, construc-
tion sites, driveways-inhabited during the day-
time: and abandoned for the night. These pho-
rographs are about the discovery of the presence 
of other people through an exploration of space. 
Inanimate objects stand in for the absent human 
figures. What remains in the: landscape after 
nightfall is a haunting residue of human spirit, 
left behind as a testament to our fundamental 
loneJjness.
