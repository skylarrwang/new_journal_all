So, You Want to Be an 
Academic Superstar? 
Watch a master and learn. 
by Gabriel Snyder 

SPIRING ACADEMICS! HEADS UP! AS ANY GESO MEMBER 
knows, you can't get a job .in academia unless you're a 
star. But if you want to be one of the truly great-a lecturer 
who can draw 500 students to a class, a scholar known 
beyond the ivory tower-you're going to have to work hard 
and start soon. 

Jonathan Spence (SY '61, GRD '65) is just such an 
Academic Superstar. A world-renowned scholar of Chinese 
history, he allegedly penned the bulk of the 876-page-long 
The Search for Modern China with nothing but a notepad 
while sitting in a booth at Naples. And, with his Sean Con-
nery looks, he has long been a campus sex symbol. Now, Spence is in the 
middle of an international tiff that has managed to make the front page 
of The New Yt>rk Times and newspaper entertainment columns across 
the country. 

Lowly Oxford knowledge worker David Selbourne was set this fall 
to publish a book, The City of Light, which describes the voyage to 
China in 1271 of Jacob d'Ancona, a Jewish-Italian merchant. If true, 
Jacob would unseat Marco Polo's title as the first European to tell the 
West about the rich culture of Asia. Astounded, the Times gushed in a 
front page arricle that Selbourne's book "is an immensely important 
find." 

Not so fast, our dear Spence said. Word had leaked out that in a 
soon-to-be-published review of The City of Light (incidentally for The 
New York Times Book Review), Spence would call the manuscript a hoax. 
Eight days after the book was heralded as a triumph, publisher Little 
Brown announced that the release of Selbourne's book has been post-
poned indefinitely. A Little Brown publicist was quoted, "We heard 
through reporters last week that Spence felt it was a fake and would be 
saying so in the Times." For his part, Selbourne whined, "Uncreative 
_ academics are always distressed when a fellow academic writes some-
~ thing which attractS attention and becomes popular or sells." But to no 
~ avail; a Titan had spoken. 

~ 
If you wish some day to wield enough intellectual might to topple a 
~ ground-breaking book in one fell swoop, pay attention.

We find Spence in a bright and airy office in the House That Gaddis 
~ Built, otherwise known as Luce Hall, waiting to counsel undergraduates 
~ during office hours. Spence is properly attired in a striped button-up 
~ shirt and dull green sweater vest. Preferred accessories include his tor-
~ toise shell reading glasses (though he's nor wearing them at the moment) 
~and a salt-and-pepper beard. 

Academic Superstar ruk number one: To be an Academic Superstar, you 
must look like an Academic Supmtar. 
After a reporter intrOduces himself and asks if he can 
schedule an interview with him, Spence is quite gracious as he 
offers a seat at his table and says, "Oh no, let's do it right here." 
The reporter, embarrassingly unprepared, sits down to begin. 
Spence claims to have no idea why the media has paid 
so much attention to his gripe with Selboume. "I think this 
is very much a non-story," he says. Spence even aims a dart 
at his own editors at The New York Times for putting the 
article lauding Selbourne's "discovery" on the front page in 
the first place. "Entire revolutions get less space. I cannot 
understand the thought process behind it." However, Spence is no 
stranger to the media; he frequently contributes to the New Yt>rker, The 
New Republic, and The New 10rk Times Book &view. And over the past-
week, Spence has received numerous calls from magazines, newspaper~, 
and radio stations. During the interview he pulls out a yellow notepad 
with several sheets almost entirely coated with pencilings of names and 
telephone numbers. "If anything, it shows the media loves a good mys-
tery," Spence concludes. 

Academic Supmtar rule number two: Hold the press in disrtgard, but 
be nice to them all the same. Above all, get hooked up with a good media 
outfit. 

Though even the publisher says that it was Spence's opinion which 
led Little Brown to shelve The City of Light, Spence does not think Little 
Brown should have canceled the book on his account. He says, "It seems 
to me it would be silly to do so. Book reviewing is an egalitarian process. 
They should have cast the net much wider." Yet, he does not feel Set-
bourne's book merits publishing. "I wouldn't censor Selbourne, but I 
don't think scholars could get much from his book." Rather than 
Spence: Destroyer of Books, he sees himself playing a much smaller role 
in the incident. "Here I am," he claims, "simple homespun Yalie, saying 
I don't know about this. If anything, I would say it's the majesty of 
Mother Yale. I'm just one of the workers in the vineyard." 

Academic Superstar ruk number three: Act aloof No matter what the 
situation, never admit that you are, indeed, an Academic Superstar. HOUJa)-
er, making grand, authoritative statnnents is requisite. 
Coroliary tQ Academic Superstar rule number three: &main unyield-
ingly loyal tQ the univmity that granted you tenure in the firrt place. 

When a student shows up to talk with her professor, the reporter 
excuses himself On his way out, Spence, in his dignified and learned 
British accent, says, "It was a pleasure meeting you." 

Academic Superstar rule number four: Master a foreign accent. IIIJ
