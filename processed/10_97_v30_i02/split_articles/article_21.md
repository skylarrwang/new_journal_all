Helen, with her son Kajuan, may rose her family's welfare benefits this month. 
who offered to take him in. "She's the only 
one who would have helped me," Ramon says 
of Ester. "I thank her everyday. 
'Gotta help yourself" 
David has lived without welfare at 
Immanuel Baptist Shelter on Grand Avenue 
for several months, floating from temp job to 
temp job. 
"If you need help, gotta help yourself. 
Ain't nobody gonna take care of me but me." 
David is black, tall, wears a pony tail and a 
graying goatee. He looks pretry together for a 
client at the shelter. 


A supervisor announces the 7 p.m. smoke 
break at the shelter; men roll from their cots, 
scrounging for cigarettes. Some of the clients 
are dean and well-shaven. Others stagger out 
smelling like garbage. "I'm just keeping it real 
with you- the system stinks," David fumes 
through his cigarette. But, he sees welfare cuts 
as inevitable, almost warranted. "People took 
advantage of the system and the system is just 
paying itself back." 


"I've been in and out of jail." He got out 
of prison last January and has been clean for a 
year and a half 
David is regaining his independence the 
hard way. Like most poor, unemployed indi-
viduals, he relies on temporary manual labor. 
He sleeps in the shelter, saves his wages in a 
bank account, and ofren eats at soup kitchens. 
Food stamps save him money, and although 
as a recent inmate he's eligible for GA, he has 
chosen not to use his months of eligibility

while he has steady work. He knows that GA 
alone can't get someone off the streets. "Twen-
ty-five bucks a week, man? That's nothing." 


With 12 years experience as a trucker, 
David has a marketable skill, but he can't 
drive commercially until he works out a dis-
pute with the state over his license. He's con-
tent to slowly regain his independence with 
whatever work he can find. "I work my ass off 
for five bucks an hour," he says. 


He looks around the shelter in disgust. It's 
a filthy place, a ragtag boot camp of destitu-
tion and boredom. "I'm working, hoping to 
get myself up outta here," he tells me. "Wel-
fare was designed to help you get a job. We 
got people who wanna work, though there are 
many who would fuck the system at any 
chance they get. But there are negative and 
positive views. A lot of families gonna get hit, 
a Iotta people gonna need a Iotta help." 


'I'm gonna pray' 
Helen and her children could use some of 
that help. "They giving me 'til December. 
Then I gonna be off." If Helen cannot find a 
job or convince the state that she has looked 
for one, her family benefits, which she desper-
ately relies on, will be cut immediately. 


Helen's family lives in the second story of 
a shabby brown house in the Dixwell neigh-
borhood. After 50 years of white-Bight and 
povetty, this working-class street has aged, 
peeled, and overgrown into a quiet but poor 
srreet. Three-story houses with porches and 
terraces line the sidewalk. Most lawns are lit-
tered with trash. 


Inside, the house smells faintly of decayed 
wood. Kajuan (pronounced "Ka-won"), a 
chubby, wise-cracking eight-year-old, runs to 
meet me on the creaky steps. The living 
room, lined with a faded carpet, is tidy but 
the furniture is old. Helen lives here with her 
children, Kajuan and Malika, and Grafton, 
her 33-year-old brother who suffers from 
epilepsy and diabetes. 


Helen has received welfare since she was 
pregnant with Malika in 1982. Like over 80 
..Percent of the households receiving Tempo-
rary Family Assistance (TFA), there is no 
father in the house. At the time Malika was 
born, welfare for families was called Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children. With the 
federal changes in 1996, families now face a 
limit of 21 months on TFA. In order to be 
granted an extension after the limit, one must 
be employed or demonstrate an effort to find 
a job. Mothers must attend job search pro-
grams and keep a log of applications and 
interviews. Termination of benefits await fam-
ilies who do not follow the stringent job-
search regimen. The system requires single 
parents to simply find a job and to accept any 
position they land. "I have to do what I have 
ro do to make someone independent," a 
Department of Social Services (DSS) worker 
tells me. "If that's a minimum wage job at 
Burger King, well, it's better than nothing. 
And when they work they'll still receive bene-
fits." As an incentive to work, any income up 
to 125 percent of the poverty level can be 
earned without getting cut off ofTFA. 


With her poor education, spotty work 
history, and handwritten resume, it's likely 
that the only work Helen can get is a mini-
mum wage position. Unemployed, Helen is 
totally dependent on entitlements. DSS sends 
her $407 per month. She receives $180 in 
food stamps from the federal government. 
She's fortunate to receive substantial rental 
assistance because most poor families must 
wait years before receiving housing grants. 
But the approaching deadline threatens to put 
the family out on the street. 


Along with family photos and decorated 
magnets, two letters are attached to the refrig-
erator. One is a reprimand from Kajuan's 
principal, the other is a threatening note from 
DSS. 


At yesterday's meeting with her DSS case 
worker, she received the ultimatum she'd 
expected for months but not planned for: 
either demonstrate a commitment to finding 
a job or not receive an extension. 


"I knew about the limit, I just didn't 
expect it so soon. I know I'm gonna find 
something, and I'm gonna pray. I applied for 
the six-month extension, but they told me I 
had to find a job," Helen cries angrily. "I tried 
to find a job, it's not my fault if I can't get a 
job." She's not sure what she's done wrong. 


Approximately 2,000 families in Con-
necticut will reach their 21-month limit this 
month. DSS estimates that nearly 700 will 
have their benefits terminated. Food pantries 
which deliver groceries to families have 
already felt an increased need as women 
scramble to find jobs. 


Helen's job search has not gone well. "I 
worked temp at Pez candy for a whole month, 
but then they cut me off," she frowns. These 
days, she works for a cleaning company, 
though they only calJ sporadically. She's filled 
out countless applications; even fast food 
restaurants down the block have not calJed her. 


Helen lives day-to-day, but there's food 
around the house. While we're talking, 
Kajuan sneaks into the kitchen. We hear him 
pour a bowl of cereal. "!'low Kajuan, I told 
you not to fix no snacks before dinner time!" 
Helen shouts, shaking her head and rums to 
me. "And I know he won't finish his dinner." 


Helen's proud of her children. "You doin' 
hairsrylin', plumbin', and computers, right 
Malika?" She beams at her attractive daughter 
who attends a vocational high school. 


Malika is soft-spoken, but aware of the 
problems surrounding her. "The president 
should do something about it. There ain't 
enough jobs and it's just gonna get worse. I 
would try and be president, if I could, even 
though I'm a woman." Helen has a bank 
account for her daughter's future, but that 
money too will be spent if need be. 


Her brother, Grafton, is unemployed and 
cannot find work due to severe epilepsy. The 
fumily will depend on his disability checks if 
their benefits are terminated. But for now, I'm 
eating Kentucky Fried Chicken with Helen 
and her family. We're laughing, and the Jack-
son Five is blaring in the background. The 
happiness is eerie. I wonder where this family 
will go if their next check doesn't come. Ia)
