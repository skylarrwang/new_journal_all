**Title: Working Sucks**
**Author: Andrew Young**
**Page number(s): 7-8**

The Yale Midterm god is not a happy god. 
lt is not a forgiving god. It is not a kind god. It 
is a relentless, jealous, angry god. It requires 
appeasement. 

Week after week and year after year, like 
humble supplicants, we offer up rituals to 
OcroBER 17, 1997 
Midterm god and her friends Finals god and 
Homework god. We present to them long 
hours of study without sleep, daily meccas to 
class, and the memorization of important reli-
gious texts on math and history. On important 
holidays, we endure all-nighters, hoping that 
our misery will inspire a spark of pity in the 
gods who. will grant us a prosperous career, a 
white picket fence, a beautiful spouse, and Ulti-
mate Happiness. 

Th.is is utterly ridiculous. Let's all quit 
school, burn our books, and live happy and 
productive lives without the crutch of higher 
education. Working sucks. 

So says Tun, a Harvard dropout who works 
five hours a week as a computer programmer. 
Five hours. Tun languidly passes his days on his 
coUective farm, reading, playing the flute, vol-
unteering, and writing. Armed with a pen name 
of no less than "Tun Righteous," he is the 
author of a bright-yellow pamphlet titled W&rk-
ing Sucks, which presents some pretty heavy-
duty thinking in plain English on Tun's way of 
life as an alternative to the normal grind. This 
year the pamphlet made its way to Yale via 
Tim's friend Lydia Stein (DC '01) and into my 
hands a couple of weeks ago. My midterm-
soaked brain, beaten down by hours of study-
ing, drank it all in. 

The pamphlet starts with the idea that 
work stunts a fulfilling life: "Work takes time 
from other, better things like being with our 
families and friends, travding, making love, 
drinking beer, painting, writing, reading, play-
ing music, cooking, eating good food, etc. 
These are things that make life rich and interest-
ing. Work makes life boring, short, and gray." 

Then Tun gives us a way out of the "work 
and consume trap" by outlining a strategy for 
working less. "The trick is learning how to 
work less by learning how to spend less." 

According to Tun, spending less involves 
pinching pennies, living communally, and quit-
ting school. 

Okay. Maybe this is going a bit far. But, 
going back to the first part, I mean, working 
really does suck. And no one knows this better 
than the stressed-out Yalie. 

In fact, Tun had us in mind when he put 
together his pamphlet. After I tracked him 
down, he told me, "The middle class propa-
gates itself by insisting that you always. defer 
happiness by going to school, then coUege, then 
climbing the career ladder. It puts up the illu-
sion that if you stop rurining, something bad 
will happen. It took me all the way to graduate 
school to realize that I could stop running and 
disaster wouldn't befall me." Tun advises us to 
take some time off from school and examine 
whether or not we really want to be here. 

Lydia, the student who gave me the pam-
phlet in the first place, says, "I think W&rking 
Suckstdls us to have a lot of fun, not to put our-
selves in the track of work and consume, work 
and spend. It encourages us to be critical of the 
institutions around us. I think we should really 
seriously consider this way of living, not just 
philosophically ponder it." 

Perhaps you're tempted to laugh. Myself, I 
can only think about Tun who is probably 
hanging out on his farm and wondering what 
he's going to do with all that beautiful free time.

**Title: I'll Be Watching You**
**Author: Monica Kim**

You leave your parents when you come to 
Yale, only to find another set of people keep-
ing tabs on your life. Your seminar professors 
take attendance. Your section leaded monitor 
participation. The bursar's office counts every 
dollar you owe. Even your peers keep an eye 
on you. 

But once you graduate, you're free, right? 
Wrong. Mother Yale is keeping a close eye on 
7 


you, even after you think that you've escaped 
her omniscient gaze. High in the tower of the 
Yale bureaucracy:sits an office that you proba-
bly never knew existed. But they certainly 
know that you exist. This is the Development 
Office of Yale Alumni Affairs. And they make 
sure that they know as much as possible about 
your affairs. 

The office hires undergraduates to devote 
themselves entirely to the job of following 
your career. Roger Labady OE '01) and Nadira 
Stewart (CC '99) are two of eight undergradu-
ates who stalk you through the pages of vari-
ous high-profile publications. Armed with 
highlighters, they read entire magazines, high-
lighting every single name they come across. 

"There's a cubby area filled with maga-
zines," Nadira explains. "We just go and pick a 
magazine, read it, and highlight names as we 
read." The stack of previously read magazines 
·contains copies of Forbes, Fortune, Crain's, Wall 
Street fourna4 and The New ·lOrk Times all 
bearing bright yellow streaks. 

After highlighting, they enter the names 
into a computer datab~ of Yale alumni. If 
there is a match, the undergraduates enter a 
summary of the article featuring the alum. 
Then, they photocopy the article 
and tuck it away in a 
file folder labeled with 
the alum's name. 

These innocent spies 
even have a title within 
the world of the Develop-
ment Office: scanners. The 
undergraduate scanners are a 
small part of an entire sub-
culture devoted to faithfully 
following your post-collegiate 
life. There's a reason Nadira and 
Roger only read through busi-
ness-specific publications. They 
only scan for the ones who strike 
it rich. 

The Development Office is 
actually not an obscure, obsessive 
fan club of Yale graduates-it is a cottage 
fundraising industry. The office has made 
procuring money from Yale graduates a fine 
art which makes the Development Office a 
favorite of Mother Yale. The university has 
given the office three Boors in One Century 
Tower, a huge building complete with marble 
Boors, plush chairs, and revolving doors. And 
the 
luxurious, 
wood-paneled 
elevators 
announce floor numbers in a voice distinctly 
similar to the infamous voice-mail lady. 

Directly across the street from the Devel-
opment Office is the abandoned child of Yale's 
financial administration: the financial aid 
office. A nondescript building which makes do 
with makeshift computer-printed signs which 
read "Undergraduate Financial Services- 2nd 
floor," this particular office is clearly a victim 
of neglect. 

But back across the street, Yale graduates 
are received with open arms. "We even meet 
the alums in person," says Vilandria Turner, 
the manager of research. '1\nd we have exten-
sive background informacion, which the scan-
ners provide, on each alum's interests." 

So, ifYale is a home away from home, can 
we ever leave? Turner laughs good-humoredly. 
"Nope! We hold 60th year reunions!"
