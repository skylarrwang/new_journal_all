EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
We are pleased to 
note that 30 years 
ago, almost to the 
day, Volume 1, Issue 1 
of The New Journal rolled off the 
presses. But we recognize that this 
important anniversary is bittersweet. 
The end of one's twenties is 
sometimes a period of panicked 
changes. As the 30-year-old man 
notices his thinning hair, his expand-
ing gut, and his growing distaste for 
popular radio, he's bound to recall 
his faster days of youth. Adulthood 
sets in and often manifests itself in a 
desire to own a lawn mower and get 
good gas mileage. 

Here at The New Journal, howev-
er, we approach our fourth decade 
with untempered enthusiasm. Sure 
we remember our younger days, 
proud of all that we've accomplished. 
Our unrivaled 30-year stability as an 
undergraduate publication and the 
600-plus staff members who have 
moved through the masthead are 
particular points of pride. But rather 
than trying to re-live the individual 
achievements of our glorious youth, 
we're keeping ourselves committed 
to the principles that were behind all 
of those accomplishments: sound 
writing, innovative thinking, and hard 
work. With these elements we can 
confidently speed forward while 
remaining happily married to our 
past and cheerfully plodding towards 
middle age. 


**Title: Poring over the Foundation**

FOR THOSE WHOSE ONLY CONTACT WITH 
Yale is through the national media, the uni-
versity must seem to be constantly locking 
horns with one opponent or another in an 
effort to defend a fundamental principle. Tra-
ditionally, Yale's adversaries in these epic bat-
tles have had all the human faces. Three 
years ago it was Texas 
gazillionaire Lee Bass, 
Then it was the cud-
chewing union members. 
More recently it's been 
gay activist and playwright 
Larry Kramer, followed 
immediately by a group of 
Orthodox Jews. 

Those of us who are at ground 
zero know that life at Yale is relatively prosa-
ic and unheroic. Denizens of Yale, no matter 
how much the admissions office chirps about a 
community of scholars—do not spend every 
waking moment pondering the future of west-
ern civilization, the exploitation of the working 
class, the validity of queer theory, and the 
moral poverty of the dorms. However, those 
who do feel strongly about any of these issues 
spend their time within the institution lobby-
ing for small changes that will make life at Yale 
more accommodating to their needs and 
wants. 

The Slifka Center, Yale's relationship to 
New Haven, the REFLAGS committee, and 
directed studies have all become things Yale 
can brag about. What were once gaping weak-
nesses in the university (religious intolerance, 
poor town-gown relations, a lack of gay 
studies) have been filled by a series of smaller mea-
sures that most agree are steps in the right 
direction. 

The national media is much less likely to 
pay attention to these because small, local 
actions are sure to draw a yawn in a USA Today 
editorial meeting. But when a controversy does 
manage to cause a ripple of interest in the 
national media, Yale gets caught up in a tsu-
nami because its spokespeople are quick to cast 
what could be a minor problem into a do-or-
die fight for its very foundational principles.  Office of Public Affairs spin-master Thomas 
Conroy said on the media portrayals of Yale in 
connection to the Orthodox Jews issue, "I 
don't think a story like that is negative as long 
as Yale is seen standing up for its principles."  & immovable as it wishes its gothic build-
ings were, the Yale administration 
has positioned itself in these 
brouhahas so that any com-
promise is tantamount to 
toppling the institution. 
However, this brink-
manship has, for the 
most part, been unnec-
essary. When faced 
with individual con-
cerns such as the 
complaint of the five 
students who are Orthodox Jews, 
Yale responds by appealing to the absolute 
values embedded in the residential college sys-
tem. By publicly relying on a fundamental 
principle, they enlarge the debate so that it 
becomes larger than it ever had to be. The New 
York Times (which covers Yale almost as well as 
the Yale Daily News) would have hardly batted 
an eyelash at a story chronicling the negotiations 
over bathroom rules and visitation practices. 
Instead, the Yale Five complaints, which 
basically amounted to living conditions—a 
gripe virtually every Yale student shares—have 
turned into a debate about Church and State 
and the essence of modern religion. & a Yale 
student you have to wonder, "Don't these 
things happen at other schools?" They most 
likely do, but problems at other schools never 
seem to make it much further than the U-Wire. 
And, well, we wouldn't want to criticize, 
but Yale only seems to come out looking silly. 
The administration was all too willing to claim 
leadership in gay studies, but when their bet 
was called, they were forced to fold and reveal 
their lack of confidence in gay studies as a valid 
academic field. Their everyday actions, such as 
the Homebuyers Incentive Program and the 
Kosher Kitchen seem hollow when Yale's 
grander statements send the opposite message.
