Lucas Campos (PC '99) is Chicano. 
Yet, the reason he identifies himself as Chi-
cano might be difficult for some to grasp. 
While Lucas's father is from Mexico, his 
mother is mainly of English and French 
descent. Standing six-feet tall with blue 
eyes and light brown hair, Lucas certainly 
does not stand out as a member of any par-
ticular ethnic group. His parents divorced 
in his infancy and he was raised by his 
mother with almost no contact with his 
father in a household which did not 
emphasize his Mexican heritage. "I only 
really started thinking about being Chi-
cano when I was around 16 or so. My mom 
definitely encouraged me to examine my 
identity more." 

Since coming to Yale, Lucas's connec-
tion to the Chicano community has grown 
stronger. He is a member of Yale's Profes-
sional Society of Latinos, and has partici-
pated in both P.R.O.P. and Science, Tech-
nology, and Research Scholars, a Yale pro-
gram that helps minority students find 
positions in research labs. "Shannon Sali-
nas [the former dean and director of the 
Chicano Cultural Center] was my mentor 
here when it came to learning about Latino 
programs," Lucas says. "Through organiza-
tions and experiences I've had over the past 
few years, I know many more Chicanos 
and a lot more about my own culture than 
I've ever had the chance to in the past." 

Indeed, Lucas's Chicano identity, coupled 
with his academic excellence and love of 
chemistry, was instrumental in winning a 
two-year 
$10,000 
grant 
from 
Yale's 
Boucher Fellowship, a program designed to 
encourage minority students in graduate 
studies. 

Lucas takes exception with those who 
would question his Chicano identity, no 
matter how latent. "My father was from 
Mexico," he says, "and that makes me just 
as Chicano as anyone else." 

Dean Richard Chavolla, director of 
Yale's Chicano and Native American Cul-
tural Center, emphasizes that at Yale eth-
nicity comes down to more than just skin 
color. "It's basically a process of self-identi-
fication," he says. "If one chooses to identi-
fy as Chicano, then we don't question 
whether they are or not." 

Much like Dean Chavolla, Dean Kim-
berly Goff-Crews, director of the Boucher 
Fellowship and the Afro-American Cultural 
Center, makes it clear that students at Yale 
must define their own ethnic identity. 
"There can be no litmus test for race," she 
explains. "It is only the individual himself 
that can decide what his own identity is." 

When deciding who is eligible for programs 
for minority students, the same rule applies. 
"If a fellow identifies as Chicano, or any 
other ethnicity, his identity is valid and will 
inform him as a scholar as well as diversify 
the field of study he enters." As Lucas puts 
it, "I may not have grown up eating Mexi-
can cooking every night or speaking Span-
ish, but I'm learning more about what it 
means to be Chicano every day."
