ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STICKS OUT IN MY MEMORIES OF 
preseason freshman year is the glimmer of my coach's gold 
ring from winning soccer nationals in college. The rest of 
preseason was ten days of aerobic exercise punctuated by 
anaerobic exercises, some suicide drills, and a few sprints. Four times a 
day the women's varsity soccer team gathered to workout-a run at 6 
a.m., then onto morning and afternoon practices, and recreational sports 
at night, which were barely recreational. At afternoon practices we lined 
up on the goal-line for suicides and our legs pleaded for mercy. 
Throughout the year there was chatter about the team winning the 
Ivy League championship ring. It didn't materialize that year, or last year, 
but the fingers of this year's women are clawing for it. The pleasure of 
playing the game was never a dull incentive compared to a shiny ring, but 
it did move the game in a more professional direction. There were scout-
ing reports, warnings about dangerous players, and meetings in the 
Smilow Field house conference room. The more business-like competi-
tion also meant that for those stranded on the bench it wasn't all adrena-
line and enthusiasm. Some cried for not playing, some cried for not play-
ing well enough, and some cried for playing and getting injured. Though 
this intensity made winning all the more sweet, it made losing all the 
more harsh. 


After the federal government passed Title IX in 1972, requiring all 
colleges to fund women's sports, there was often a shortage of women ath-
letes and a lack of enthusiasm in athletic departments. To drum up sup-
port the government printed propaganda pieces like the one titled, "Try 
it, you'll like it!" Far from the days when the government pleaded for 
women's athletics, women's soccer is now a well-established part of Yale. 
The program boasts a growing fan base, an increasing interest among 
prospective students (ten new recruits this year), a locker room, laundry 
pins, and an extensive wardrobe sponsored by Fila. No one's going to 
push these ladies off the field. 


As women's sports have become established at the collegiate level, 
women have been moving into more professional sports arenas. Through 
institutionalization, commercialization, and unprecedented hype, women's 
sports have emerged as a growing industry. Twenty-five years after Title IX 
initiated the catch-up game, what are the effects of becoming better estab-
lished? Does the development of professional sports mean that in future 
years I'll find the hand of soccer captain Jill Rubenstein plastered across my 
Wheaties? 


Yale women's basketball coach Cecilia DeMarco says that the expan-
sion in the basketball program has provided opportunities for students 
who wouldn't have otherwise thought of Yale. "A number of prospective 
students gained their first exposure to Yale through a phone call by a 
coach who made them aware of the possibilities open to them." On the 
negative side, DeMarco notes that the college athletic system that banks 
on a successful win is dangerous. "It allows young players to be taken 
advantage of, manipulated, and, at a young age, get entangled in a large 
business," she says. DeMarco also cited the trend of not graduating, or 
less dramatically, of getting credit just to play and not to learn. "Injury is a 
reality check," DeMarco says. "One injury and that's it. This new career 
could evaporate, not even leaving a diploma with which to build another 
career." These concerns are slight enough to slip through the cracks of 
Yale's flagstone paths, but for schools that churn out athletes, they are seri-
ous issues. 


Men's sports, a multi-billion dollar industry that serves as the model 
for nascent women's leagues, has long been prone to corruption. Marcus

Camby graduated two years ago from the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts and landed with the 
Toronto Raptors as the number two NBA draft 
pick. Camby now admits that as an undergrad-
uate agents hoping to land his talent gave him 
thousands of dollars in the form of cash, rental 
cars, jewelry, stereos, and prostitutes. One 
agent, Wesley Spears, is accused of procuring a 
prostitute for Camby and allowing him to have 
sex with her in his house. Camby isn't too wor-
ried about the exposure of his exploits ruining 
his career. "People have a right to hold what I 
did against me. But I think all it will take is for 
me to make the All-Star team a few times in a 
row to make people forget about the mistakes I 
made in the past," he has said. After both play-
ing the agents and being a victim of their 
games, Camby, now 23, signed with the large 
sports agent company Proserv for a three-year 
$8 million contract. 


I saw the women's national soccer team, 
which competes professionally, play last year; 
the majority of the women on the roster were 
fresh from the University of North Carolina 
and weren't over 20 years old. These women, 
rather teenagers, are forced to make critical 
career decisions when others are still thinking 
about their get-up for the Saturday night Safety 
Dance. When I see little girls in ice skates on 
TV, I wonder if after the competitions they go 
searching for their innocence in the crevices of 
their nylons, the way I was always curious 
about what was in my sock when it crumpled 
at my toes. The development of women's 
sports, on college and professional levels, has 
opened doors to many, to be sure. But as men's 
sports have shown, the existing precedent is 
prone to manipulation, greed, and a Grinch-like 
grasp on innocence. 


"Once upon a mid-day dreary, we 
came to play some ultimate ... " I 
thought they were 12 angry Wes-
leyan women running at us to vindicate their 
loss. They lined up in front of us and sang. 
"Yale, why you want to give us a run-around? 
Sure-fire way to pump us up!" I hadn't heard a 
cheer after a game since the perfunctory "two-
four-six-eight who do we appreciate?" in mid-
dle school and even then it was almost too 
compromising for my competitive mind-set. 


Two years after I walked on the soccer field, 
I walked off and onto the ultimate frisbee field 
across the street. I never would have guessed 
that the view of sports could be so different 
from the other side of the fence. There is noth-
ing in this club sport—except perhaps striving 
to be exceptionally weird—that inhibits players 
from playing to play the game. We piled in cars 
to get to a sectional tournament which seemed 
to me just a meadow with four cones to delin-
eate a field. After a game we would sit down to 
think of a cheer. Trying to come up with rhyth-
mic compliments about the other team, no 
matter if you have won or lost, puts the game 
in perspective. By cheering you show respect to 
not only the other team, but also to the spirit of 
the game. 


"Spirit of the Game"—the unwritten rule 
book for ultimate—isn't a goddess demanding 
sacrifices but a theme which replaces game reg-
ulations and refs. In ultimate, there are only 
self-called fouls, which horrified me at first 
since I have always enjoyed taunting the referee 
and his or her mother. But the spirit of the 
game is to play the game, not to create obstacles 
in the pursuit of a win. When I substituted into 
one game, the girl I was marking smiled and

asked me how I was. AHHH! Horror number 
two: no trash talking. Spirit of the game also 
means that everyone seems to know everyone 
at tournaments and this camaraderie reflects an 
attitude of a common goal—advancing and 
enjoying the sport—not just a team goal of 
winning. Sitting in our circle after the game, 
the atmosphere, besides the lingering foot odor, 
was positive. If it wasn't, people wouldn't play, 
because ultimate doesn't come with any other 
benefits. There are no laundry pins, no 
Gatorade, no Fila uniforms. Ultimate is not a 
means to anything else. 


The missing perks do not go unnoticed. 
Ultimate players eagerly seek out the services of 
Yale sports therapist Dr. Barry Goldberg during 
the two hours each week he treats club sport 
athletes. But I asked co-captain Ann Lightbody 
what she would say if ultimate could become a 
varsity sport. Despite the shiny benefits, she 
told me, "No." The fact that the ultimate team 
would turn down the offer of their very own 
practice field, uniforms, coaches, and travel 
expenses shows that, to them, something 
greater would be lost than gained in the 
exchange. Not to mention that dashing plaids 
and argyles would probably be outlawed. 


I stopped playing soccer when my veteran 
position, left bench, was getting crowded and 
the time commitment infringed on my other 
extracurricular activities. But from the sidelines 
I still celebrate the equality, opportunities, and 
higher quality of competition that the progress 
of women's sports has created. As assistant soc-
cer coach Fritz Rodriguez says, "This is an 
overall positive phenomenon. This is where 
women should have been years ago." But as I 
celebrate, I question what the government 
meant by the "it" in "Try it, you'll like it!" Is 
"it" cooperation between universities and 
women, or is "it" simply the men's sports 
industry model? I'm afraid that in the hype of 
the women's sports industry, women will, at all 
levels, give up their supportive cheering and 
follow in the footsteps of the men's $150 shoe 
market. Women have tried "it," are good at 
"it," and institutions like "it." Now that the 
industry is established and prosperous enough 
to ignore that prodding motto, perhaps it 
should simply be, "Try it as you like it." Genny Taft, a junior in Trumbull College, is on
