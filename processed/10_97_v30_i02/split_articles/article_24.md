Life on Saturn 
Jazz's first and last extraterrestrial band leader

Space Is the Place: The Uvea and nmes of Sun Ra, by John F. Szwed

''I 
DON'T SEE HOW THE GOVERNMENT 
or anyone else could expect me to 
agree to being judged by the standards 
of a normal person," Herman Poole Blount 
wrote to the National Service Board for Reli-
gious Objectors in 1942 pleading for an 
exemption from the World War II draft. 
Blount, an introverted and hernia-ridden 
young piano prodigy, had his appeal rejected. 
For four months he bided his time in a jail cell 
and, finally, at a service camp where conscien-
tious objectors did forest work in lieu of mili-
tary service. During this period he wrote 
another letter, concluding with a chillingly 
bleak postscript, "It would probably be more 
merciful to be killed than to be as I am." He 
returned home to Birmingham, Alabama, in 
1943 a changed man, one ready for a new life, 
a life to which earthly standards would never 
apply. 

In 1952, after 38 years spent working 
under terrestrial constraints, Blount renamed 
himselfLe Sony'r Ra-Sun Ra to friends, asso-
ciates, and the world at large. When be began 
to claim Saturn rather than Birmingham as his 
birthplace, it was assured that no one would 
again characterize him as normal. Sun Ra 
developed into the most unconventional mem-
ber of the jazz avant-garde, a local eccentric 
wherever he went, a scholar of mystical etymol-
ogy, Egyptology, and secret Biblical equations 
whose derivations only he could trace. As a jazz 
composer, his songs supplemented standard 
jazz instrumentation with a bevy of handmade 
and foreign instruments with names like the 
flying saucer, the lightning drum, the boom-
bam, the rnistro clarinet, and the cosmic tone 
organ, shaping a musical corpus whose creativi-
ty and uniqueness rivals that of any musician. 
Performances by his band, the Arkestra, might 
find between five and 80 musicians clothed in 
flowing multi-colored robes and headdresses-
Sun Ra decorated his with a scale model of the 
cosmos-blowing and beating their instru-
ments in a fury while dancers, vocalists, and 
free-form gesticulators moved, grooved, and 
chanted amidst a host of colored lights. By the 
time he left this earthly plane in 1993, Sun Ra 
had gained countless acolytes and fans and 
recorded over 120 albums filled With the most 
out sounds ever to vibrate the ear drums of this 
planet's simpler, humanoid populace. 

While Sun Ra's life was filled wirh the kind 
of unique incidents readers love to read about, 
the mysterious existence he led offers a daunt-
ing challenge to the biographer. In his recently 
published Sun Ra biography, SptU-e is the Place, 
John Szwed (Hon. MA '82), Yale professor of 
anthropology, Afro-American studies, and 
American studies, welcomes the challenge that 
Sun Ra's life provides. Szwed, known to under-
graduates for his popular jazz history course, 
acknowledges the difficulty of reading Sun Ra 
in a section of the book entitled "The Inter-
view as Jeremiad," which positions Sun Ra's 
words as an extension of his playing: 

He talked in an unceasing monoronic flow 
which absorbed everything in its pa~ues­
tions, comments, objections, disrractions. He 
soloed wirh words, calling and responding to 
himself, using per licks or filling back on patent-
ed phrases when memory or creativiry tailed 
him, riffing, keeping the music of his words 
moving forward in a scream of energy which pro-
pelled him and maimained his Strength and 
hdped bring a hint of danger into his perfor-
mances. Threaded through all of his talk was rhe 
literature of the world, references to daily news 
events or what he had jusr seen on television. 
And he never strayed far from the Christian 
scripture which he sometimes used ironically, 
sometimes literally. He had the preacher's love of 
the extended meraphor, pushing a single figure 
to its breaking poinr, revising, and shifting direc-
tion in mid-senrence. 

To draw meaning from these verbal gam-
bits, these impenetrable constructs of reference 
and apparent non sequitur, Szwed tells us one 
might have to read 20 lectures or 30 interviews. 
Always in search of a clear summation of phi-
losophy, a key document to elucidate the tangle 
of a life, what is the scholar to make of such a 
man? How does the writer cope with a subject 
from outer space? 

T
he answer, 
perhaps, 
lies in secret 
history, an offihoot of postmodernism-
the punching bag for those who confusedly 
point at academia and ask, "What madness 
passes for knowledge in the 1990s?" Propo-
nents of secret history are dedicated to reinforc-
ing the elusive connections which bind togeth-
er cultural moments by the thinnest of threads. 
Perhaps Szwed's most direct predecessor in 
this endeavor is Greil Marcus, a writer with the 
intellectual and cultural breadth to go from 
teaching American studies at UClA Berkeley 
to writing for Rolling St<Jne. In his 1989 book 
Lipstick Traces: A Seem Hist<Jry of the Twmtiah 
Century, Marcus constructs an ornate non-lin-
ear narrative connecting the 1916 founding of 
Zurich Dada, the French Situationist Interna-
tional of the 1950s, and punk rock circa the 
Sex Pistols' 1976 American tour. Weaved 
throughout his book are unexpected references 
to pop culture detritus like Police Academy 2 
and Michael Jackson and more intellectual 
domains like Gnostic Christianity and the 
Frankfun School. Marcus gave license to many

to view history as a continuous web of hermet-
ic geniuses, avant-garde intellectuals, and 
crackpot artists linked by onqmiversal uncon-
scious. In some cases his method has led sec-
ond-rate authors to use tangential connection 
as the basis for establishing impossible causal 
relationships. This tendency has bled into the 
mainstream as well. Between X-Files and the 
militia movement, alien abductions and Men 
In Black, there is a liberal sprinkling of the dis-
sociative associations of which secret history is 
made. Thankfully, Szwed returns secret history 
from the realm of the paranoid conspiracy the-
orist, proving that sometimes such associations 
stem from more than imaginative leaps. 

Signs that Szwed has ingested Marcus litter 
the book. (His occasional mentions of the 
Gnostics- secret history's favorite touchstone 
for explanations of all that is hermetic and 
unexplained, essentially the black helicopters of 
secret history's adherenrs--<:inches that conclu-
sion.) In the figure of Sun Ra, Szwed has found 
the perfect candidate for this historical method. 
Sun Ra not only had a deep-seated belief in the 
connections between the ancients and the 
future, he did his best to express this belief in 
every word and gesture. 

A
t first glance, Sun Ra's pattern of thought 
seems scattered-he made connections 
between Egypt, outer space, and the plight of 
blacks in the United States. It would be easy to 
plot out the points in Sun Ra's intellectual life 
as a series of solitary dots on a nonsensical 
chart. Indeed, many have painted Sun Ra as a 
brilliant buffoon-a ridiculous, albeit talented 
footnote in the history of music. Szwed, how-
ever, connects the dots and depicts Sun Ra's 
crackpot ideas as a unified intellectual land-
scape. He does this by taking Sun Ra seriously, 
a method previously untried with a man 
known to most as the jazz. king of the cosmos. 
Sun Ra's identification with Egypt is con-
nected to black nationalism by way of obscure, 
early twentieth-century philosophical and 
quasi-academic books with names like The 
Children of the Sun, God Wills the Negro, and 
The Anacalypsis: An Attempt to Draw Aside the 
Veil of the Satanic Isis or an Inquiry lnw the Ori-
gin oflanguages. Szwed points out that a 1791 
essay on Sun Ra's all-time favorite reading 
list-Count Augustine Vo1ney's The Ruins, or 
Meditation on the Revolutions of Empires and the 
Law ofNaru~was also a favorite ofWilliam 
Blake, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and 
OCTOBER 17· 1997 
Walt Whitman. With a figure as unconvention-
al as Sun Ra, it is easy to pass off certain interests 
as mere outlandishness for its own sake. Szwed 
goes directly to Sun Ra's sources and reads them 
with the same attention and seriousness he uses 
to read the man. Szwed's path lets us imagine 
how Sun Ra might have thought, why he cher-
ished what he did, and how he made the trip 
from the South to the spaceways. 

By the later pages of the book, Szwed goes 
even farther, entering Sun Ra's mind and mim-
icking his mental process in prose. Take, for 
example, the question of Sun Ra's distaste for 
earthly religion and the signs and symbols of 
Christianity. Sun Ra left us with traces of his 
faith: a few harsh reactions upon seeing the 
crucifix, a flair for wordplay and punning, his 
insistence that he was never born because birth 
meant you must die. Szwed solves the riddle. 
The cross represenrs death, the worship of the 
god of death as opposed to the ever-living god. A 
whole civilization has been created establishing 
the values of death as good. So the cross is some-
thing sinister, a reminder of a trick and a failure. 
It reminds Christ and all the messiahs mat if you 
rerum, you'll get it again. "When Simon, Peter, 
and Andrew were fishing with ners, Jesus called 
to them, and told them he would make them 
fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19]. "Net" reversed 
is "ten"; X is the Roman numeral for "ren." The 
net is Christ, he is being used to trap humans. 
"X-mas" is a mass for the dead. ... The confeder-
ate Aag has an X on ir .... 

When Szwed first begins to spice his narrative 
with bits such as this, it jars, but the overall 
effect slips the reader's consciousness into Sun 
Ra's-the only way to make the beliefs of this 
unearthly character ring true. Szwed quite per-
suasively argues that Sun Ra's belief in the 
alchemy of the word as the key to meaning is 
an intellectual system with an unshakable form 
ofimemallogic. 

hankfully, Szwed allows himself to go 
beyond the evidence his subject left on 
this earth, connecting him to traditions of a 
more recent vintage. Images of intergalactic 
escape--the common focus of Sun Ra's chants 
from the stage--are compared to slavery-era 
spirituals and Baptist hymns which evoke pre-
vious struggles at the base of the pyramids, a 
return to the Promised Land, and flight. 

For Szwed, Sun Ra's pseudonym is more 
than a spuriously chosen stage name. First 
there is a quote from an address by the Nation 
of Islam's founder, Elijah Muhammad, who 
was making his way around Chicago at the 
same time as Sun Ra was getting his chops in 
the Windy City as an itinerant jazz man: "My 
poor blind, deaf, and dumb people are going 
by the wrong names and until you accept the 
truth of your identity and accept the names of 
your people and nation we will never be 
respected because of this alone." 

Szwed then traces the .evolution of renam-
ing among Mrican-Americans, moving from 
names which connote the lack of a true identi-
ty (Malcolm X, Frederick Douglass) to a dis-
cussion of stage names meant co lend a regal air 
(Duke Ellington, Count Basic) to a concluding 
quote from The Artist Formerly Known as 
Prince which indicates another possible ratio-
nale for renaming: "I don't mind if people are 
cynical or make jokes-that's part of it- but 
this is what I chose to be called. You find out 
quickly who respects you. It took Muhammad 
Ali years before people stopped calling him 
Cassius Clay." 

Szwed points out the traditions Sun Ra fol-
lowed and the practices he strengthened, citing 
another intergalactic entertainer, George Clin-
ton, who said, "This boy was definitely out to 
lunch-the same place I eat at." 

Despite the impressive scope and erudition 
of Szwed's book, there are some areas sadly 
lacking in attention. After the minute details 
given in descriptions of Sun Ra's early years, the 
later half of this book comes as somewhat of a 
disappointment. From the 1960s onward, the 
decades seem to bleed together. This is under-
standable--after Sun Ra assumed an inter-
galactic form of citizenship, he became less 
forthcoming regarding the minutiae of his 
life-but it is a shame since this will likdy be 
the best account of the man that we ever get. 

Finally, though, Sun Ra is a figure defYing 
rigid categorizations, closed loops, definite 
answers. Szwed kindly gives the reader the 
room to hold onto a piece of the unreality 
whicb Sun Ra fostered. So, when we read in 
another of Sun Ra's notes to the Board for Reli-
gious Objectors, "Although I do not know you, 
I feel more at home writing to you than I 
would anyone nearer to me in vicinity," we can 
believe that he was writing not just to a group 
of men and women who were deciding his fate 
on earth, bur to beings who danced among the 
stars--a hello note in advance of his final, 
posthumous homecoming.
