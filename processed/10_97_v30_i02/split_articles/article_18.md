With neither telephone numbers nor street addresses, the food vendors 
near the Medical School try to sort out the city's plans for their future. 

BETWEEN II A.M. AND 3 P.M. EACH WEEKDAY, THE CORNER OF 
York and Cedar streets near the Sterling Hall of Medicine 
becomes a movable feast. Dozens of vendors' pushcarts line 
the circular sidewalk, and the surrounding air hangs heavy, 
laden with the heat misting off cooking grills and the sick-sweet scent 
of frying oils and simmering noodles. Festooned with garishly-colored 
umbrellas, the pushcarts are chrome-and-Formica affairs, occasionally 
belching up gusts of steam. Customers come &om all directions on this 
mid-autumn a&ernoon, many &om Yale-New Haven Hospital, just 
across York; they wear white coats and laminated ID tags. Those in 
white are less likely than other customers to sit down with their Styro-
foam boxes of pad thai or General Tso at a picnic table on the stone-
tiled courtyard. They hurry back across the street, leaving the vendors 
an extra moment to take a breather as the a&ernoon's shadows lengthen. 


The vendors lean against their Chevy Blazers and Toyota pickups, 
parked nearby; in about an hour they will load the cars with coolers 
filled with unsold soda and food, hitch up their pushcarts, and head 
home. For now, they steal a smoke and chat with neighboring sellers. 
Baseball comes up a lot-vendor Lam Nguyen, who goes by "Phil," 
is rarely seen without his Red Sox cap. The weather. Local politics. I ask 
them about the bill currendy under the Board of Aldermen's considera-
tion that would place stricter limitations on outdoor vending in New 
Haven. "The question is why. We need an answer," Phil says between 
pulls on a Marlboro Red, his eyes focused over my shoulder as he 
watches for approaching customers. "There's a lot of rumors going on 
in the city that there is some proposal. If that rule is put into effect, 
there will be no vendors. We heard about a rule that will make us go 
200 feet away &om any public building. We heard there might be an 
English test to get a permit." Phil gestures vaguely at a nearby vendor; 
when I approached her earlier with a few questions, she silendy 
demurred with a confused smile. Her English appeared limited to "Can 
I help you?" 


"I don't know why they're doing it," Phil goes on. "Talk to that hot 
dog guy. He knows." But I've already chatted with the hot dog guy, 
Kevin Murphy, of Jack's World Famous Hot Dogs. "I hear they're try-
ing to shut us down," Kevin told me. "But people got a right to eat 
where they want to eat." He was explaining to me how his grill worked 
when he wandered off, mid-sentence, in search of an extra gas tank. 
Left alone, I went to talk to Shou Bim Chen at Liu's Lunch. "Now we 
might have to find new jobs," he said. "It's the city of New Haven 
doing it, but Yale doesn't want us around. We get too much business." 
Indeed, the only food-service competitor in the immediate area is the 
Yale-New Haven Hospital cafeteria. Chen then pointed me toW3..\"d 
Phil. "Oh, you already talked to the hot dog guy," Phil says, "Yale is 
behind it. I don't know why. We still haven't heard what is going to hap-
pen. We might have to leave. We find out October l, when we have to 
get new permits." Phil is friendly and talkative, but seemingly against 
his better judgment; he is standing up straight now, and shifting his 
weight back and forth between his feet. He points toward the 
Mamoun's cart and tells me, "The Greek guy knows. Ask him." 


Ask Joelle Rhodes, legislative liaison for the Office of the Mayor, 
about the vendors' assorted concerns, and her smooth phone voice 
reach~ a slighdy higher pitch. "There has been a campaign of misinfor-
mation to incite people on this issue. This always happens when we are 
trying to negotiate new legislation," she says. The official language of 
the proposed ordinance claims only to regulate the location and opera-
tion of vending stations and establish tighter procedures for the suspen-
sion or revocation of licenses. Rhodes dismisses nearly every vendor's 
qualm I bring up. "We're not trying to attack the vendors or get rid of 
all vending in New Haven. We just want them to be consistent with 
stated distances from schools and churches," Rhodes says. No, the 200-
feet limit probably won't be passed. No, there was never any plan to 
administer an En~ish competency exam. No, Yale is not working with 
the mayor's office on the proposal. As for October 1, the date that so 
many of the vendors at York and Cedar seemed to regard as a D-day of 
sorts, Rhodes explains, "Well, permits are renewed October 1. I guess 
the vendors expected the ordinance to be passed and enforced by then." 


It's just one piece of misinformation wafting in the smoking air 
between the vendors, but in its own way, it makes sense. If Kevin Mur-
phy or Shou Bim Chen are under the impression that the Mayor's 
office, the police, or Yale intends to shut down their operations, and 
they had to wager a guess, a logical time for the crackdown to occur 
would be the day their licenses expire. I recall what Phil said when I 
asked how he heard about the proposal-"Everybody talks. People 
around here talk about it" -and realize that the 20-odd vendors work-
ing at York and Cedar are engaged in an ongoing game of Telephone. 
The mayor's office has contact with lawyers hired on retainer by the 
owners of Jack's Hot Dogs and Brittany's Lunch. Those lawyers talk to 
the owners, who then talk to their workers. Those workers then talk to 
the self-employed vendors. Faets shift and warp. They are even, per-
haps, lost in translation-first languages among the vendors include 
Greek, Thai, Vietnamese, and Hindi. 


"I can't sit here and counsel the vendors 24 hours a day," Rhodes 
says. "I know there's a lot of misinformation going around, but all I can 
say is, the proposal is a working document. What was proposed is not 
the end-all, be-ali." Rhodes points out that under current guidelines, 
the city can be held liable for any accidents that befall a street vendor or 
for any problems they cause, such as obstruction of pedestrian traffic. 
But she stresses that much of her office's interest in presenting the pro-
posal is due to the fact that the vendor ordinance has not been over-
hauled since 1928. 


"And ignored since then," John Williams rebuts when I talk to him 
later that day. A lawyer representing several vendors, Williams likens 
the efforts to revise the vending ordinance to overhauling a decree 
against, say, jaywalking. "Who card" he keeps repeating. "But they're 
doing more than just revising. They want to make it impossible for 
vendors to vend." Williams points out that under the proposed ordi-
nance, licenses would be non-transferable; instead of just a single estab-
lishment, each and every worker would need a permit. "It amounts to 
harassment, and these issues come up due to intermittent spasms of 
yuppiefication," he says. "The mayor's office wants to turn New Haven 
into Disneyland or Greenwich, if there's a difference." While Williams 
confirms that calk of an English test for vendors was never anything 
more than idle rumor, he says, "It speaks to the attitude the vendors 
perceive, that the city is looking down its nose at them." 


By the time I have my conversation with Williams, October 1 has 
come and gone, and I head back down to York and Cedar. Phil sees me 
coming and taps a co-worker on the shoulder; they watch me walking 
toward them, wearing hesitant smiles. "They extended our licenses 
until January, so we'll know by then," Phil tells me before I have a 
chance to ask him anything. He says the Board of Aldermen will vote 
on the resolution in November. We chat for a bit, but I'm stuttering, 
fogged over with distraction. Neither Joelle Rhodes nor John Wtlliams 
mentioned a November vote to me; both called the ordinance's 
timetable "indefinite." I suddenly realize the latest factual casualty of 
the vendors' gossip machine: aldermanic elections are in November, so, 
via the grapevine, voting for aldermen mutates into, as it were, alder-
men voting. "So we don't have to worry about anything until next 
year," Phil concludes. 


The next morning, I ask Maureen Butler, New Haven licensing 
officer, about the three-month extensions granted on the food vendors' 
permits. "Well, that was true for a couple of days," she says, "but now 
the mayor's office has decided that the vendors have to renew their per-
mits. The licenses are good until March. They're working on the laws, 
you see." I mention that I spoke with some vendors just yesterday, and 
no one told me that they needed to renew their permits. "They'll find 
out within the next week, probably," Butler replies. I ask her how. 
"Well, they'll find out through word of mouth," she .says. "We don't 
have their phone numbers, so there's really no other way." I glance at 
my clock. It's 10:30 a.m. The pushcans rolling into York '\;Od Cedar 
just about now might as well be the wheels of the rumor mill, clicking 
intogear.
