ofRoman politics? Elihu Yale's father might have 
read this edition ofTacirus printed in 1622. But 
now the book's cover and spin~ are detached 
from its body, and little chips of the Imperium's 
history fall off with each turn of the page. 

The SML renovation is meant to create a 
suitable modern home for Sterling's holdings, 
but the rebuilding process now stands in viola-
tion of Hippocrates's famous dictum: "First, do 
no harm." 

The treasures of SML sit unnoticed in cor-
ner alcoves and temporary carts, carelessly 
stacked and exposed to the choking grit of the 
long, slow installation of new wiring, elevators, 
and ventilation systems. Up on floor 4M, the 
books on the shelves are in disarray, tossed in at 
odd angles like pieces of an unsolved jigsaw 
puzzle. A thick volume rests uneasily between 
two larger texts, unprotected by a cover, with-
out title page or call number. No scholar could 
ever find this book-a shame because in it are 
three years worth of newspaper clippings from 
the Civil War. Not reprints, not copies, but 
actual newspaper columns reporting the deci-
sive Northern victories ("the following account 
of the battle of Gettysburg on Wed. last ... "), 
cheering Sherman's march through Georgia, 
and scrutinizing Lincoln's peace negotiations. 

In Beinecke, these relics would be in an air-
tight glass cube, protected &om theft and the 
dements by futuristic alarm systems and translu-
cent marble slabs. Here in the hean of SML, 
however, newspapers from the Civil War are at 
the mercy of the dust, the water, and the kind-
ness of whoever happens to stumble upon them. 

So, as you turn the pages, be careful not to pull 
too roughly because the wrinkled 18-inch-page 
might come loose. Remember, while you run 
your fingers over the newsprint to feel the tex-
ture, that you are depositing oil and sweat on the 
kind of primary source that historians pore over. 
While putting the volume back, be gentle-the 
book is already in two pieces. Among the hack-
saws, blowrorches, and hammers, this little bit of 
history never really had a chance.
