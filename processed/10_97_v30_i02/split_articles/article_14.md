. On the third Boor of the University The-
ater, a wire-mesh barrier sections off a dimly-
lit corner of the Yale School of Drama library, 
protecting the 70-year legacy of the 
YSD alumni. For some, 
these 
"cages" are little more than a dun-
geon of forgotten theses, the final 
resting place for material that 
once held the spotlight on the 
stage two flights below. But for 
James Magruder (MA '84, 
MFA '88), a visiting lecturer 
whose own doctoral thesis 
entered the cages in 1992, 
these volumes represent the 
theatrical hits of the future. 

Magruder's contribu-
tion to the dramatic legacy 
is his English translation 
of Pierre de Marivaux's 
obscure 18th-century French 
comedy La Triomphe de /'Amour. His script 
made its public debut with a 1993 production 
at Center Stage Baltimore. But after the cur-
tain fell on closing night, The Triumph of Love 
wasn't quite ready to return to its dusty shelf 
in the drama cages. Instead, it prepared for yet 
another translation-this time into another 
genre. Magruder will unveil this final incarna-
tion on October 23rd, when Triumph of Lo~ 
opens as a musical at the Royale Theater in 
New York City. 

Magruder dubs his path to Broadway "a 
jaw-droppingly freakish stroke-of-fortune." 
He adds, "For my collaborators, it is the ideal-
ization of a dream. As somebodJ who wishes 
he were writing more fiction, this is like a 
freak accident-an extraordinary freak acci-
dent." 

Magruder says, "Triumph of Love the 
musical marries theater, French literature, and 
musical theater-kind of a weird culmination 
of my prevailing interests." 

This Yale-bred marriage had a bittersweet 
homecoming last winter during the produc-
tion's engagement at the Yale Rep where it was 
greeted by a mediocre reception. "The Yale 
Rep had not done a new musical in 22 years, 
and I don't think they were ready," he says. 

The Broadway audiences, on the other 
hand, have been far more receptive, lapping 
up the preview performances of the reinvent-
ed Triumph, extensively rewritten and recast 
since its New Haven engagement. With each 
successive draft, 25 in all, Magruder finds 
himself relying less on the literal Marivaux 
and more on the author's style. "My guiding 
principle was that if I'm entertaining myself, I 
might be able to entertain others," he says. "I 
wasn't going to create a translation that 
couldn't have been on the stage." With the 
imminent Broadway opening and prospects 
of a national rour with a London company, 
Magruder can expect a healthy stage life 
before his creation at last returns, albeit trans-
formed, to its original home in the drama 
cages.
