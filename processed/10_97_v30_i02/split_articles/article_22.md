EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
LET'S SAY YOU'RE PlANNING A NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN, THE 
social event of the season, and you have nothing to wear. 
You don't have much time, so you head to Chapel Street, 
bypass the Gap and enter Ann Taylor, searching for 
something sexy yet sophisticated. Toting your new silk charmeuse 
blouse out of the store, you continue down Chapel. That's when it 
strikes you-the perfect complement to this evening's ensemble is just 
three doors away. It's something 
daring, spontaneous, eve'n 
sensual: a nipple piercing. 
Even if you don't opt for 
that item (perhaps out of 
concern for time, or more 
likely out of pure fright), it's 
impossible to miss The Edge 
Beauty and Tattoo Company's 
hulking, faux-Gothic storefront 
opposite the New Haven 
Green. 

The word "TATTOO" in 
neon lights casts a blue shadow 
on those who peer into the 
shop's tinted front windows. 
Passersby are arrested by The 
Edge's striking appearance and 
are drawn to press their noses to the glass. Employees and their 
friends loiter near the store's entrance, smoking cigarenes and eating 
food from nearby China King. They watch in amusement as the sign 
on the door deters potenrial customers. Ir reads: 
PLFASE: NO SMALL CHILDREN 
NO FOOD NO BEVERAGES 
NO ALCOHOL OR DRUGS 
NO ONE WILL BE TATTOOED UNLESS 18 YEARS OLD 

Those who do decide to enter The Edge's cavernous expanse are 
'g> assaulted by industrial music piped through the mouths of 
~ strategically placed gargoyles. Pornographic cartoons play on a 
,; television screen mounted against an imitation-stone waH, high 
1; above the buzzing needles of the tattoo artists. Glass cases exhibit 
~ silver jewelry of widely varying shapes: barbells, hoops, plugs-the 
&_ tools of the trade. The potencial client, if overwhelmed by sample 
tattoo designs covering the walls, can sit on an overstuffed black 
leather couch and peruse the latest canoo magazines. If this frightened 
lamb hasn't yet mustered the courage to undergo the procedure, she 
can escape with a few sticks of incense or a store T-shirt. 

Bill Steward, manager of The Edge, stands behind the front 
counter surveying the clientele. The only hair visible above his 
shoulders are his goatee and eyebrows. A silver hoop dangles from 
each of his ears. A large, Native 
American-inspired band is 
tattooed around his ·left calf, 
and he bends down to proudly 
show off the mushroom that 
he recently tattooed on his 
ankle. In contrast to this 
hardened exterior, Bill laughs 
freely and often brings his 
employees cookies when he 
returns from lunch breaks. 

Four months ago, Bill's easy 
smile dimmed when he found 
an article entitled "Getting 
Under New Haven's Skin: 
Tattoo Parlor Has Critics 
Fuming" splashed across the 
front page of the New Haven 
Register. Having never been approached by a reporter, Bill wondered 
just why the critics were fuming. 

"We really didn't hear anything about this until after the doors 
opened, and then not even from the city. What we knew we got from 
reading the paper like everyone else," Bill says. He pulls a file from 
behind the counter, and reveals an inch-high stack of newspaper 
clippings. As he leafs through the pile, he periodically stops and says, 
"Nothing. We heard nothing from these people." Ludicrous as it may 
seem, the controversy over the store's location developed without 
The Edge's knowledge or direct participation. 

Following the shop's opening on July 1, its name surfaced in 
several local newspapers and on local talk radio. The Chamber of 
Commerce issued a press release on July 7 stating, "We would no 
more advocate location of a tire-changing facility and car wash, or an 
indoor flea market, on the corner of Church and Chapel than we 
would this type of business ... there are plenty of places for tattoo 
shops to locate outside of the core downtown district." A car wash? A 


flea market? The Edge is not "this type of business;" it is something 
altogether different. 

The Edge is "cool." It's "in." It's "hot." Everything about the 
place, from its mobile advertisement, courtesy of a souped-up 
second-hand Hummer, to· its selling of Punky Color hair dye and 
patchouli incense, screams "twentysomething," "shocking" and 
"rebellious." It may seem strange that Yale no longer has a video 
store, a department store, or a mainstream movie theater near 
campus, but The Edge brings to New Haven an alternative element 
that has become typical of university life. 

A recent article in The New York Times Magazine detailing 
contemporary collegiate culture featured a photograph of a student 
being tattooed. At least three of the seven other Ivy League schools 
are in close proximity to tattoo parlors. Body piercing has been 
featured in everything from Seventeen magazine to 20/20. And the 
way the trend is heading, the more outrageous the piercing the 
better. You may not know it, but that cute guy sitting next to you in 
orgo could be sporting more. metal than just his belt buckle. 

Like most things classified as cool, this phenomenon is all about 
image. The Edge draws its clientele as if by subliminal attraction. Irs 
mystique contributes to its appeal as much as its employees' 
appearances do. Sandi Mansfield, a full-time piercer, can be found 
lounging on one of the black couches at The Edge. Her fuchsia hair 
starkly contrastS with her pale complexion. The jewelry from more 
than ten piercings above her neck occasionally catches the light and 
makes her face sparkle. She says, "I think it's more upscale to fit with 
the look of New Haven. It's like a new breed of tattoo shop. There's 
been a lot of money put in here." This upscale nature is what draws 
Yalies into the shop. At Denton's Jewelers ir. the Chapel Square Mall, 
piercings are $5 across the board {they do ears, noses, and sometimes 
eyebrows). Though piercings at The Edge begin at $25, students opt 
for their services-partly because of the image and partly because of 

With its bourgeois-youth-gone-wild mystique, The Edge also 
brings the newest, and arguably the safest, piercing techniques. 
While piercings at the Chapel Square Mall are done using a piercing 
gun, The Edge uses a hollow piercing needle. As Bill explains, they 
"core out" a hole for the jewelry, rather than "splattering and" 
stretching" the skin with a gun. This method reflects the importance 
of sanitation at The Edge. With white linoleum and mirrored walls, 
the shop's back room resembles a hospital more than a tattoo parlor. 
Inside, sterilization machines loaded with tattoo needles and body 
jewelry hum in constant combat with germs and bacteria. 

Visions of a seedy one-room tattooing dive may have danced 
through city officials' heads this summer, but soon after The Edge 
opened its doors, the city quietly accepted its existence. As Sandi 
says, "New Haven didn't realize what this was going to be." While 
downtown New Haven is being revitalized with the Omni Hotel and


other enterprises, the arrival of businesses 
like The Edge and the nearby Temptations 
strip dub worries urban developers. There 
are no guarantees that places such as these 
will be attractive to the city's desired 
patrons. But do city officials really know 
who these patrons are? 

Yalies are flocking to The Edge. At any 
given time, three or four students roam 
around the shop, pricing both jewelry and 
procedures. They comprise roughly 25 
percent of the shop's business, but Sandi 
says, "I think once everyone gets settled in, 
'we'll get more students." One afternoon a 
Yale student has Korean characters tattooed 
on her shoulder; on another, a New Haven 
man has a Samurai warrior tattooed across 
his entire bicep; later that day, a New Haven 
teen comes in to have her tongue pierced. 
Bill boasts that numerous policemen and 
firemen have been tattooed in the shop as 
well, including a fire chief. "We've gotten 
nothing but positive responses fro~ people. 
The communiry's been really supportive," 
Sandi affirms. 

After four months, all the hype about 
having The Edge on the greater Yale camp4s 
seems to have been generated out of pure 
sensationalism. Students and New Haven 
residents alike have not hesitated to 
patronize the shop. In fact, The Edge is one 
of the few stores on Chapel Street that 
always has customers inside, if not there to 
buy, then at least to look. It is one of the 
nicer establishments on the strip, 
unquestionably cleaner than China King's 
kitchens, and better kept than the 
Casablanca Boutique. "The conception of 
tattoo artists as low-class is historical, but it's 
changing now," Sandi says. "Back then, 
work was done in jail or little shops without 
sterilization. Now it's more acceptable and a 
lot of people are coming back to it." The 
Edge's management and patrons aren't 
looking to tarnish the city's changing image. 
They just want to keep the culture current, 
and maybe add a few extra holes.
