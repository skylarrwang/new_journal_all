EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To write a book that claims to teach its readers how and why to 
read seems presumptuous and just short of impossible. Yet equal-
ly presumptuous and impossible seem attempts to codify the 
canon of western literature and to prove that Shakespeare invent-
ed humankind's modern conception of itself, two tasks that 
Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale, 
pulled off with brilliance and grace in his recent books, *Th~ 
western Canon* and *Shak~sp~ar~: The Invention of th~ Human*. 
Unfortunately, Bloom's latest attempt, *How to R~ad and Why*, falls 
short of teaching the lesson its title promises. Though inspired and 
remarkably elegant at many moments, the book lacks cohesion, 
offering esoteric criticism on a seemingly random smattering of 
short stories, poems, novels, and plays, rather than an extended 
meditation of some sort on the pronounced mission. The book 
would more aptly be titled *What I've Read and How I've Read It*. 

Bloom begins the book with a bold introduction, announc-
ing his affections for his critical mentors, Dr. Samuel Johnson and 
William Hazlitt, and his intentions to continue in their tradition 
of "experiential and pragmatic, rather than theoretical" criticism, 
the sort of literary analysis that strives "to make what is implicit in 
a book finely explicit." Bloom employs such criticism in his 
attempts to answer the central, and problematic, question of his 
book: "Information is endlessly available to us; where shall wis-
dom be found?" I say problematic because this question, as Bloom 
poses it, seems more at home in *Th~ ~stern Canon*, where Bloom 
tells us what to read, discussing the various schools of great litera-
ture and the particular wisdom of each, than in *How to R~ad and 
Why*, which, ostensibly, will teach its readers all that the title sug-
gests. 

Thankfully, Bloom quickly abandons this question, moving, 
at least for a short time, into the how and why, rather than the 
what, of reading. Combining the philosophies of Johnson and 
Francis Bacon with Ralph Waldo Emerson's belief that the best 
books "impress us with the conviction, that one nature wrote and 
the same reads," Bloom issues this formula for reading: 
Find what comes near to you that can be put to the use of 
weighing and considering, and that addresses you as though 
you share the one nature, free of time's tyranny. 

This is sound advice, which Bloom attempts to heed and 
illustrate in a discussion of some 18 short stories, 21 poems, 15 nov-
els (divided into European and American sections), and three 
plays. Diligently addressing the issues of how and why to read for 
all of these texts is nearly impossible, especially in this slender vol-
ume of 283 pages. Bloom barely has the time to tell us what he has 
read, let alone how and why he has read it. 


All is not lost, however. The book is 
valuable as a companion to the lucky texts 
Bloom has chosen. Before and/or after 
reading any of the stories, poems, novels, or 
plays featured in the book, a reader would 
be wise to consult *How to Read and Why* 
for, at the very least, a short analysis of the 
text that is likely different from his or her 
own. Moreover, one is bound to be 
inspired by Bloom's reverence for and ded-
ication to great literature. Though his 
haranguing against the critics of the 
"school of resentment"—academics who, 
saith Bloom, destroy great literature by 
engaging the ideologies of multicultural-
ism, feminism, historicism, etc.—becomes 
tiresome, what is most evident in Bloom's 
scholarship is his sincere belief that reading 
great books does something wonderful for 
us, that it helps to "strengthen the self, and 
to learn its authentic interests." 

In the most interesting and engaging 
sections of the book, Bloom makes the wise 
jump between analyzing a text for its 
implicit meaning and suggesting what 
reading that text means in the grander 
scheme of things. For example, Bloom 
offers a reading of Tennyson's "Ulysses" 
that concentrates on the speaker's ability to 
overhear himself within the space of the 
poem. As Ulysses considers his voyage and 
relationships with his son and inferiors, his 
ability to listen to his own words allows 
him to come to a greater understanding of 
himself as he moves from his opening 
lamentation, that the Ithacans "know not 
me," to his final pronouncement, "my pur-
pose holds I To sail beyond the sunset, and 
the baths I Of all the western stars, until I 
die." 

Bloom capitalizes on the strength of 
his own reading as he translates his analysis 
into a more general lesson for his readers: 
Only rarely can poetry aid us in 
communing with others. . . . 
Solitude is the more frequent mark 
of our condition; how shall we peo-
ple that solitude? Poems can help us 
to speak to ourselves more clearly 
and more fully, and to overhear that 
speaking .... We speak to an other-
ness in ourselves, or to what may be 
best and oldest in ourselves. We read 
to find ourselves, more fully and 
more strange than otherwise we 
could hope to find.

This is a beautiful articulation of what, for 
most readers, is the indescribable allure of 
poetry and an elegant statement of the 
power of literature as a companion and 
guide throughout the vicissitudes of life. 

Unfortunately, such moments of 
inspiration are few and far between. Much 
more frequently, the two or three pages 
Bloom spends on each text provide nothing 
more than an analytical reading. However 
good those readings may be, and however 
much they may elucidate the text in ques-
tion, they do little to achieve the book's 
purported aim. Bloom rarely engages the 
questions of how and why to read in any 
appreciable manner and, when he does, his 
suggestions and lessons are surprisingly 
simplistic. For example, in the section on 
poetry, Bloom instructs that the "first crux" 
of poetry reading is that poetry should be 
memorized whenever possible. (Strangely, 
the "first crux" of poetry reading is preced-
ed by the "first principle"—that poetry 
should be read closely—and is followed 
neither by a second crux nor a second prin-
ciple.) The disparity between the erudition 
of Bloom's own analysis and the simplicity 
of his "lessons" is jarring. Perhaps all of this 
emanates from a central problem of this 
book. It seems to me that those most likely 
to pick up a user's manual for great litera-
ture, some sort of *Reading Literary Classics 
for Dummies*, are those who would like to 
be great readers but for some reason never 
latched on to the hobby. Yet Bloom's writ-
ing addresses an entirely different audience, 
a hyper-literate population that under-
stands 
the 
import 
of words 
like 
"Rabelaisian" and, like Bloom, has spent 
many sleepless nights lamenting Turgenev's 
"tendentiousness." Unfortunately, such 
readers scarcely need to be convinced that 
reading is a worthwhile exercise or advised 
to read poetry closely. 

Though Bloom claims early on in the 
book that he "intend[s] no polemics here," 
the rigidity of his criticism puts such a 
claim to lie. According to Bloom, every 
human being must be classified as one of 
four 
types—Hamlet, 
Falstaff, 
Don 
Quixote, or Sancho Panza. Similarly, all 
short stories are either "Chekhovian-
Hemingwayesque" or "Borgesian:" "The 
first gratifies our hunger for reality, the sec-
ond teaches us how ravenous we still are for 
what is beyond supposed reality." A short 
story by Gabriel García Márquez, or any 
magic realist for that matter, breaks 
Bloom's mold. Such rigid and extreme cri-
teria for classifying works of literature, let 
alone people, seem unnecessary and odd 
from a scholar who usually offers—and 
always demands—a nuanced approach to 
literature. 

Moreover, Bloom dedicates far too 
much of the book's precious little space to 
rearticulating and reinforcing theories he 
developed in earlier books. Most notably, 
the book frequently reads like a literary 
genealogy as Bloom traces authors' effects 
on each other, as he did in his book, *The 
Anxiety of Influence*. Perhaps such an exer-
cise could help to fulfill the mission of the 
book, but Bloom does little to inform his 
readers how they themselves can discover 
or understand the Chekhovian-ness of Guy 
de Maupassant's short stories, let alone why 
they should care. Bloom also makes con-
stant reference to his hero Shakespeare, 
whom he uses as the benchmark of every 
sort of literary greatness. After reading 
*How to Read and Why*, we know that the 
nihilism of Dostoevsky's *Crime and 
Punishment* is unmistakably Shakespearean 
and that the "inwardness" of Chekhov's 
characters comes as a result of Shakespeare's 
innovation of "foregrounding" his charac-
ters. Perhaps these are valuable lessons, and 
a reader of Bloom's Shakespeare would like-
ly be excited to learn them. Yet in the con-
text of *How to Read and Why*, they are irri-
tating, taking the place of information that 
would better teach the lessons at hand. 

Throughout his book, Bloom makes 
constant reference to two impending crises: 
the demise of American education at the 
hands of politicized scholars who use liter-
ature only to advance ideology and, more 
importantly, his own old age (around 70 
years). The book, then, seems to be Bloom's 
attempt to shore up the fragments of great 
literature against the impending ruin of 
education as he himself enters what he 
seems to think will be the final chapter of 
his reading life. In doing so, perhaps he 
heeds some of his own advice a little too 
closely: "Do not attempt to improve your 
neighbor or your neighborhood by what or 
how you read."
