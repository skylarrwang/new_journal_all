o New Haven would be complete without a pizza place, and 
New Haven, Kentucky, has the New Haven Pizza Shoppe. 


Hundreds of miles from Pepe's and Sally's and the traffic of the 1-95 
corridor, New Haven sits at the junction of KY-52 and u.s. 31E. If I 
hadn'r seen it on rhe map while planning a visit to nearby 
Mammoth Cave National Park and the birthplace of Abraham 
Lincoln, I might never have noticed ir at all. You can drive through 
it in a minute, missing the town hall, the museum, the pharmacy: 
It's just another small town. 


Coming from the north on 3IE, I found myself on Main Street. 
A sign welcomed me co town and was followed by a few churches. 
A block further, I hit the main intersection. To my left was a small 
building labeled Town Hall; an attached garage held the town's lone 
fire rruck. Just past the intersection, the Cream Srat!on (an "udder 
delight") serves ice cream, the pharmacy offers everything from pre-
scription drugs to arts and crafts, and the pizza shoppe serves lunch. 
Across the srreet is T he Sherwood Inn, the local bed and breakfusr 
since 1875. I crossed the railroad tracks, saw the Kentucky Railway 
Museum on my left, and found myself leaving town. Driving 
through, I saw lircle resemblance ro the town's older, more famous 
namesake in Connecricut. There is no ocean, no gothic university; 
there isn't even a high school in town. 


Town Hall is a small, simple building that stands out only 
because of the plaque in front that commemorates New Haven's 
war dead. A note on the front door told me I would have ro wait to 
see the inside: "Gone ro bank. Be right back." I began to wonder if 
the whole city shuts down when someone needs to run more than 
one errand or ger some lunch. I returned later and met Linda 
Mattingly, a city employee since 1988 and residem of 35 years. 


According co Linda, the mayor was not in. Linda told me about 
New Haven's government and gave me a tour ofTown Hall, which 
consisted of two rooms: a reception area, including Linda's desk, 
and a larger room in back.. Near the center of the room sat the pho-
tocopier. To its righr, a map of New Haven lay on a table used for 
meetings of rhe town commissioners. On the left, two cubicles were 
labeled with simple black and white plaques: "police" and "mayor." 


The mayor's "office" consists of a desk, a chair, and a file cabinet. 
On the side of the cabinet, any doubts as to the mayor's loyalties-
she is an outsider, originally from the Philippines-are cast aside by 
the "I Love New Haven" sticker. If the mayor stands up she can see 
right into the police chief's cubicle and discuss the lat~t crime sta-
tistics. 


Mayor Tessie Cecil won her first election almost 10 years ago. 
She is neither a Democrat nor a Republican-stare law prohibits 
cities the size of New Haven (rhe last census counted 796 residents) 
from having partisan governments-but according ro Linda the 
town is mostly "conservative Democrats." While Mayor Cecil does 
nor have the backing of a powerful political machine, she does have 
a chokehold on the office that resembles chat of another New 
Haven mayor, John DeStefano, Jr. In her first bid for re-election, 
Mayor Cecil won by a two-to-one margin; the second time around, 
no one even opposed her. Her position does not give her great exec-
utive authority, however, since she makes decisions in conjunction 
with four ocher elected officials. She cannot hire or fire city work-
ers or make unilateral decisions on the main issues that confronr the 
city, like, according to at least two residents, the ongoing argumenr 
between sidewalk proponents and citizens who do nor want their 
lawns disrupted. 


The similarities between the two New Havens do nor end with 
the political dominance of the current mayor: One New Haven is 
an All-America City; the other is an All-Kentucky City. Like their 
Connecticut counterparts, the people of New Haven, KY, share a 
pride in their history. Samuel Pottinger settled the area in 1781 for 
Harrod's Company, seeing it as an importanr shipping center on the 
Rolling Fork River. First called Porringer's landing, he renamed ir 
after a city he knew well in his home stare of Connecticut. Later, 
New Haven became an important point on the L&N Railroad. One 
of the women who runs the pharmacy is even a direct descendant 
of Daniel Boone, her partner bragged to me. Since then, trains have 
stopped coming. and instead of a bustling shipping point, the town 
is a quiet place for retirees, commuters to Bardstown and Louisville, 
and families who have lived there for generations. 


Kim Maupin grew up in New Haven, left only to anend col-
lege in Louisville, and now has a family and three children. Her par-
ems still live in New Haven, and she doesn't even know when her 
family first arrived there. I met Kim when I visited New Haven's 
one bona fide tourist attraction: the Kentucky Railway Museum. I 
didn't actually see the exhibit, but I talked to her in the gift shop. I 
told her I was from New Haven, cr, and talked to her about her 
hometown. Nearly six months later, I called the Museum from 
home and talked to Kim. "Hi, my name is Michael, and I'm from 
New H aven, Connecticut, and a couple of months ago I carne 
through town-" 


"Yeah, I remember," Kim said. "You were the one with the 
book." I had bought a picture book about trains and asked Kim to 
write a message in it to the people of one New Haven from a citi-
zen of another. After half a year, she still remembered the college kid 
who had come through town and shown interest in her New 
Haven. 


Most residents of New Haven, KY, have not made the journey 
to Connecticut. Joanne Perkins made the uip once. Joanne works 
in the p harmacy, where I stopped to learn more about the town. I 
had a video camera with me and Joanne was more than happy to be 
interviewed on film. She's lived in New Haven for over 70 years, 
and told me about irs history. But like most residents, she couldn't 
see why I was so interested in her hometown. When she came to 
our New H aven it was only for a class trip co Pfizer during her phar-
macological training. While she didn't know much about New 
Haven, cr, she did have a message for its residents: "We stole your 
llarne," she told the camera with a laugh. 


I had brought the camera to make a documentary, which, like 
lllany brilliant ideas-for road trips, never quite got finished. The 
Sli'TEMBER 8, 2000 


video would show clips of New Haven and its town liall. I'd inter-
view people about their town, and then I'd edit the clips so that the 
film would be funny. My friends at Yale could watch it and make 
fun of the town. And I did get my share of footage to laugh at-
shots of the mayor's cubicle, Joanne telling us about how they stole 
our name, and the outside of the Kentucky Railway Museum. 


But there are advantages to New Haven's size that my tape did 
not capture. A brochure printed by the newly formed New Haven 
Development Association explains: "[New H aven] still has the 
warm and hospitable atmosphere that it had many years ago when 
[its] forefathers fuse settled here. Where a hand-shake is the only 
contract needed between friends and your word is still considered a 
honorable comm itment." My first instinct on reading the brochure 
was to make fun of the town; the brochure even had spelling errors. 
But those statements on the broch ure are not just promotional plat-
itudes to joke about; talking to residents, it became obvious they 
were true. The Mayor didn't run unopposed in the last election 
merely because people don't care. She ran unopposed because most 
of the town knew and liked her. 


The L&:N Railroad doesn't come through New Haven anymore, 
but the Railway Museum still runs a passenger train. Just like peo-
ple in New Haven, cr, those in Kentucky can hop on a train to 
Boston; the train isn't as fast as Amtrak, but the trip is only u miles. 
Of course, Boston, KY, isn't exactly Boston, MA. But no one in 
Kentucky seems to mind.
