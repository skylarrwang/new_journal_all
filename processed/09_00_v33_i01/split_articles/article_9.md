THERE'S A LOT OP TALK THESE DAYS about a 
Yale graduate in the White House. Barring 
a political avalanche, soon the Executive 
Branch will wear Old Blue. But the candi-
dates aren't the only Yalies getting involved 
in politics this election year. The Yale 
Corporation, the Universiry's highest exec-
utive body, has been staying politically 
active as well. In many cases, members of 
the Corporation have been putting their 
money where most ochers can only put 
their mouths. 

One would imagine that one of the 
world's wealthiest universities would have 
atereorypically conservative trustees, but 
GOP benefactors, against conventional wis-
dom, constitute the minoriry of the 
Corporacion. 

Diana 
Brooks, 
oust 
President and CEO of Sotheby's Holdings. 
contributed $1,000 dollars co John Mc.Cain 
and George W. Bush each. Forced &om 
top of one of the world's wealthiest auc:Doo 
houses under charges of pri~ 
Brooks's donations stopped after Januarf 
2.000. William Reilly, former Direaor of 
the Environmental Protection Agen 
aJ.o 
turned out to be a generous supporte of 
GOP hopefuls. He donated $r,ooo to the re 
election campaign of Senator Richard 
Lugar (R-Indiana), the failed 1996 candi-
date for the presidential nomination. Reilly 
also gave $1,000 co Bush's campaign as well 
as another $2,000 co various Republican 
candidates for the House and Senate 
throughout the country. Ro~ Betts, 
President of Silver Screen Mal"if'8Bb1ent, a 
6lm production company, made 
eorge 
W's war chest $2,000 richer, While Dr. 
Benjamin Carson of the ohns ~~ 
Medi 
investment firm, shelled out $1,000 to 
presidential hopeful Bill Bradley and 
another $3,000 ro various Democratic con-
gressional and senatorial campaigns, most 
notably fellow alumna Hilary Rodham 
Clinton's in New York. Holcombe T. 
Green, CEO ofWestPoint Stevens and a Yale 
School of An patron, gave $1,000 to Bill 
Bradley and a hefty $1o,ooo in soft-money 
contributions 
to 
the 
Democratic 
Congressional Committee, a national elec-
toral PAC. Charles Ellis, Managing Parmer 
of Greenwich Associates, an investment 
consulting firm, also gave $1,000 to 
Bradley's 
campaign,

bench by 
Clinton, his gratitude hasn't come across in 
financial support. David Gergen, Editor-
at-Large of us N~s and World RqJort, has-
n't spent any money on this year's cam-
paigns either. Formerly an advisor to 
Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and 
Clinton, Gergen probably would not want 
to make too explicit any party affiliation. 
Newly named trustee Janet Yellen, an econ-
omist at uc-Berkeley, has also abstained 
from donating this year. The only other 
Corporation members with no record of 
u.s. campaign contributions are those who 
couldn't give anyway-Right Reverend 
Victoria Matthews, the first female bishop 
in Canada, and Jaime Serra, Mexico's for-
mer Minister of Commerce, who are both 
foreign citizens. 

The campaign contribution data was 
downloaded from the Federal Election 
Commission on August 3, 2000, and com-
piled by the Center for Responsive Politics, 
an independent watch-dog organization.
