It is a tranquil, sunny Sunday in June
and people of all ages, sizes, and colors
pack the city lawn. Retirees in wheel-
chairs sit in the shade; giggling Puerto
Rican and Dominican girls practice
hula-hooping in the sun; dreadlocked
students relax next to their mountain
bikes; bearded men chat next to their
Harleys. Spicy scents waft from the
Thai and Caribbean food stands lin-
ing the sidewalk. On a stage at the
east end, a 13 -member salsa band
from Cuba is setting up, and saxo-
phone notes rise like bright banners
into the blue sky. Across the park is
an even more coloiful sight: four
men and four women in harlequin
costume sway in unison atop flex-
ible thirty-foot poles, dancing in
the breeze like palm trees. They
are Strange Fruit, a perfor-
mance group from Australia.
Everyone seems to be
enjoying the beautiful
summer day in New
Haven.


Yes, this is
New Haven, not New
York, or San Francisco, or
Sydney. For the past five years, the
International Festival of Arts and Ideas
has tran~formed our city with a sweeping
array of cultural offerings. This year the festi-
val ran from June I 6 to July 1 and included hun-
dreds of performances and events in every conceiv-
able category: classical, jazz, pop, and world mllsic;
opera. ballet, and modem dance: drama from Shakespeare
to street improvisation; film; visual arts; readings and spoken
lectures and .\)'mposia: historical tours; and the simply unc/assifi
Fruit. for example). For the first time, the festival expa~uled illlo
and New London. But the heart of the proceedings remained the performances
the New Haven Green.
For New Haven's transient population of Yale
students who think of their university as the domi-
nant, if not only. culwral institution in New Haven, it
can be amazing to see what goes on while they're
out of town. "It's so good to see all kinds of peo-
ple on the Green. It's very different/rom how it
looks when students are here," said senior 7}'
Hudson, who came back to New Haven
for the weekend. "/ hope the festival
will begin to change people's
impressions

Indeed, for people interested in New Haven, the effect the festival is having on the city is as exciting as the
artists drawn from all over the world. Gabe Freiman, a junior, served as Assistant Volunteer Coordinator for the
festival. I found him in the volunteer headquarters in the basement of the New Haven Free Public Library,
putting together a puzzle with a petformance artist from England and a 13-year-old volunteer. Freiman, who
finds working with New Haven youth to be the most rewarding part of his job, estimates the festival this summer
had 50 volunteers between the ages of 10 and 17, out of 300 total. "This is the first year they've had kids to vol-
unteer like this. We had kids coming in every day, saying 'Can we volunteer, and ifwe can't volunteer, can we
work?'" The young volunteers served as ushers and assistant stagehands for events, ran messages and errands,
picked up trash on the Green, staffed the information booth and folded endless brochures. Their only rewards
were free admission to some events and at-shirt. "They wear their shirt sort of like a badge," Freiman said. "We
were reserving the mediums just for the kids, and we ran om."
What motivated these inner-city kids to give up their summer to promote the arts? It seems amazingly sim-
ple. ''/started doing it to be a good citizen,'' said Deion Ross. 13, wlio was posted at the information booth with
a walkie-talkie. "I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. Also, it gives me something to do in the summer." The
