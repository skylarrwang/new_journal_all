**Endowed Chairs at Yale: A Question of Academic Control**

HAVE A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS burning 
a hole in your pocket? If so, you just might 
consider immortalizing your family name 
and endowing a Yale professorship. But if 
this price seems too good to be true, realize 
that once the check is signed, the plaque is 
put up on the wall, and Yale taps the last 
tack into the splendid new George W. Bush 
Neuropharmacology Chair, you lose any 
say in who sits in it. 

Created by individual and group 
donations of a minimum of $2.5 million, 
endowed chairs create permanent posts for 
professors within certain departments or 
disciplines. Often witness to remarkable 
succeSsions, some chairs have indeed been 
the seats of power in this school's history. 
Most remarkably, the Sterling Chair has 
been held by 159 former and current pro-
fessors, 
including historian Jonathan 
Spence and Nobel Prize-winning molecular 
biologist Sidney Altman. But fame does 
not come cheap-it cost William Sterling 
$5 million to establish the chair back in 
1918, and that was when a million dollars 
still meant something. 
More recent 
endowments include the Vincent J. Scully 
History of Art Chair, given by the 
Archimedes Association of the Class of 1958 
alumni in honor of the popular professor, 
and the Maynard Mack Chair, created in 
1998 by the bequest of an anonymous 
donor in honor of the former Sterling 
chair holder. 

Millions of dollars are nothing ro 
sneeze at-even at Yale. An endowed pro-
fessor's salary and annual research stipend 
can be put to basic departmental improve-
ments once their salary is being paid by 
outside donors. And open chairs can also 
suengthen departments by enticing new 
faculry with hopes of a future endowed 
professorship and its benefits. Even if 
Sterling chairholders receive only a paluy 
$4,000 a year for research, every dollar still 
counts. 

Despite all this, though, Yale won't 
always take your money. As donors vie for 
the opportunity to endow a permanent 
chair-and attach their name to it forev-
er-the University is caught in the dilem-
ma of accepting money in exchange for 
academic control. In a few recent instances, 
the University has held onto its autonomy 
and turned down 'bffers to create chairs. 
When gay rightS and AlOS activist Larry 
Kramer (BR '57) offered two profesorships 
in Gay and Lesbian Studies, the donation 
was rejected on the grounds that the acad-
emic worth of the subject is still being 
explored. In 1991, the Bass family attempt-
ed to endow University-wide chairs in 
Western Civilization, but Yale returned the 
money when the family demanded a say in 
selecting scholars to hold the chairs. 

The issues surrounding new chairs are 
highly politicized, and Yale is cautious 
about jeopardizing its academic integrity. 
For better or worse, Yale has passed up 
opportunities both to be at the forefront of 
scholarship in emerging fields and to bol-
ster a classical curriculum. So while a new 
professorship might make a great stoclcing-
stuffer for that special someone come 
December, it probably is not the best way 
to remold the face of American higher edu-
cation. Caveat emptor!
