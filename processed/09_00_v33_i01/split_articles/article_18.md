is most ar home with memorized phrases like this and his beloved 
proclamation that radical feminists' only achievement has been get-
ting "a bunch of ugly women to march." 

Most of Flynt's sound bites are appeals to freedom of speech. 
Flynt calls himself a First Amendment absolutist, and his rhetoric 
plays on the AJI-American values of freedom and individualism. 
(Freedom and individualism, of course, sound much nicer than 
pornography and patriarchy.) Whether I asked Flynt about the 
objectification of women, the Reverend Jerry Falwell, or Hustln-'s 
profits, everything came back to the First Amendment. "Freedom 
is nor lost in one fell swoop; it's lost one book, one magazine, one 
movie at a time," he told me. Then, echoing a famed~.QI·~~~ 
statement by Supreme Court Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist, Flynt declared, "Freedom of speech is 
not only the unrestricted expression of the thought 
you love, but also the thought you hate the most." 
he argues. "What women have to understand is that men worship 
women, and they love to look at the female form." Apparently, rites 
of worship include "Hustler's Birch Rescue," a page of the magazine 
portraying women as dogs needing masters and positive reviews of 
movies in which women are offered as "gang bang fodder." 

Flynt also plays the holier-than-thou role when it comes to sex 
and violence. He speaks passionately about "how screwed up a soci-
ety's priorities are when it's legal to publish a photograph of the 
most mutilated body-you might even win a Pulitzer Prize for it-
but you can't publish consensual sex." Flynt also feels "that gratu-
itous violence is wrong." But when I asked about the intersection of 
sex and violence, such as the infamous Hustkr cover depicting a 
woman goitlg through a meat grinder, Flynt evaded my question. 
When I questioned him more generally about the objectification 
of women in pornography, he answered, "Look at Madison

Flynt would have us see him not as a multi-mil-
lionaire who exploits women, but rather as an 
underdog, an Everyman who brings pornography 
to the masses. Tht Ptopk vs. Larry Flynt, Milos 
Forman's 1996 movie about Flynt's life and legal bat-
tles, opens with shots of Flynt's impoverished child-
hood, evoking the American Dream and encouraging view-
ers' hopes that this poor child will rise to wealth and success. 

During our interview, Flynt consistently described pornography in 
terms of class, saying, "The rich and privileged have always had 
their leather-bound editions of pornography. Today the local video 
store and bookstore have become the poor man's art museum. No 
matter how uncomfortable pornography makes the ruling class, 
they can't rake it away." Flynt next declared that Hustkr set out to 
be the poor man's Playboy. Whereas Playboy "presented an image of 
a girl that was unattainable," Flynt sought to showcase "more of the 
girl-next-door type, someone readers would see in the supermarket 
or the laundromat." 

The advent of the Internet has further democratized pornogra-
phy and has given the ruling class a new problem, says Flynt, who 
launched the Hustkr website a little over four years ago. "For cen-
turies people have been controlled by the flow of information. Now 
it's virtually impossible to control information." Flynt's voi 
tied coarsely as he repeated his favorite of sound bites: "For 2, 
years the Church has had its hand on our crotch, and the go 
ment is exceedingly moving in that direction, thinking that if it can 
control our pleasure center, it can control us. But people are not 
going to allow Big Brother to tell them what they can read or see in 
the privacy of their own homes." I almost expected the walls to 
stand and applaud. 

Throughout our interview, Flynt not only redefined pornogra-
phy as a class struggle, but also adeptly turned the definition of 
pornography on its head. Pornography does not degrade women, 
thing. Except they defend what they're doing as fashion. So 
what we're really talking about is degrees; either you're 
exploiting women or you're not." 


**Nadine Strossen: The ACLU's Perspective**

Nadine Strossen 
Nadine Srrossen, the president of the ACLU and a professor at 
NYU Law School, would for the most part agree. Strossen comes 
down on Flynt's side in the pornography debate, but presents her 
opinions with a grace, intelligence, and thoughtfulness that he 
lacks. 

Like Flynt, Strossen believes pornography deserves First 
Amendment protection. Though she wouldn't say. that the exploita-
tion of women is clear-cut, she would concur with Flynt's underly-
ing contention that the govenment has no right to protect certain 
publications while condemning others. Her view goes further than 
Flynt's, taking into account the difficulty of restricting some speech 
without getting on the slippery slope coward restricting too much 
speech-including speech that benefits women. 

Srrossen, who is tall with curly brown hair and an electric, 
comforting smile, arrived at Yale last April dressed more for a gala 
than a discussion. Her black velvet pantsuit and high heels clearly 
distinguished her from the group of jeans-wearing college students

smiled and nodded, every so often interjecting comments and anec-
dotes. 

When Strossen began to speak about pornography, she 
perched at the edge of her seat, letting her lively hands punctuate 
her talk. 

Srrossen considers herself a ferniWsr, yet is careful to distin-
guish her views from those of radical feminists who support the 
censorship of pornography. She argues that censorship does more 
harm than good to women, noting that censorship measures sup-

ported by feminists in the past have often backfired. Most recent-
ly, the liberal Supreme Court of Canada accepted radical feminist 
prescriptions regarding pornography, and actions were brought 
against works by the Likes of Zora Neale Hurston, Audre Lorde, and 
Gertrude Stein while mainstream pornography went unchecked. 

Strossen knows that such examples of censorship are her most 
powerful argument against liberals who oppose pornography. 
Conservatives would probably be glad to see feminist and lesbian 
volumes disappear from their local bookstores along with Hustkr, 
but liberals are rightly worried about this possibility. And Strossen 
also knows that it is the liberals who oppose pornography-and not 
the conservatives-that she is most likely to win over. Such liberals 
were probably her only opponents present at the master's tea, and 
Strossen was careful to address a pitch to them, as well as to those, 
like myself, teetering between civil libertarian and radical feminist 
views. She paused emphatically before warning that censorship is a 
"tool of the powerful to club beliefs they don't like" and that it is 
"not a coincidence that those in the minority are the object of 
obscenity prosecutions." I was left with a haunting image of what 
would happen to my own bookshelves; I wouldn't mind if all copies 
of Hustln- (including the February issue sitting in my room) were to 
disappear, and I wouldn't even mind if Elk were never published 
again. But I would choose Hustkr's survival, even its prosperity, 
over the loss of Hurston, Lorde, and other feminist writers. 
seductive, and her warnings about 
restricting freedom of speech are pru-
dent and foresightful. 

At the same time, however, 
Strossen's unconditional advocacy of 
First Amendment rights is somewhat 
myopic. In her single-minded atten-
tion to individual choices, she works 
too hard to validate pornography 
and fails to address its conse-
quences. 

Strossen 
presents 
pornography as a victimless crime ::~~:~~~~ZEJ 
and denies the genuine harm it can cause to the 
women involved in its making, as well as its responsibility for 
degrading societal views of women. 

Rather than critique both 
Hu.stl~r and Elk for exploiting women, she denies that either publi-
cation does so. 

Strossen concluded her master's tea, "What is 
degrading for one is empowering and liberating for another. We 
have to make decisions as individuals as to what we find empower-
ing and what we find subordinating." If everyone were indeed free 
to make these decisions, her words would cercainly be true. Yet 
while Strossen's advocacy of First Amendment rights is admirable, 
the choice to defend pornography should nor be as easy as she 
makes it seem. 


**Linda Lovelace: A Survivor Speaks Out**
**Page number(s): 23-24**

Linda Boreman 
Linda Boreman, better known as Linda Lovelace, star of the 
1972 film Deep Throat, is one of many who take offense at Srrossen's 
"greeted with cries for censorship" until the Supreme Court brought 
it within the umbrella of the First Amendment. According ro 
Srrossen, the Internet completed this cycle 
with the 1996 case ACLU

mously concluded that..l::!jbldti;p.j~l 
Deep Throat, which grossed over $8oo million and for 
deserves the same degree of prorec-
which Boreman still receives fan mail: "Every time someone watch-
cion as print. As president of the 
es th 
'e, they're watching me being raped." 

For Srrossen, a civil 
libertarian, everything comes 
back to the rights of individu-
als to make their own deci-
f f 
sions. She may hare pornography 
( __ and choose not to consume it, but she 
wants this to be her personal choice; simi-
larly, she argues, one woman may find 
pornography offensive and violating, bur another should be allowed 
to engage in the profession. 

Strossen's individualist rhetoric is 
a jeans jacket. With her slightly chubby, tired-looking face framed 
by bangs and wavy long brown hair, Boreman both looked her 50 
years and seemed like a nervous high school student delivering a 
report. Her voice quivered, and she often stumbled over her speech, 
"A Survivor Speaks Out." On several occasions she paused to choke 
back or wipe away rears, and MacKinnon rose to comfort her. To 
begin her history, Boreman stated that, unlike the majority of 
women in the pornography industry who have suffered abuse as a 
child, her childhood was healthy and normal. She was surrounded 
by a loving, if strict, family, including her older sister Barbara, who 
would play with Boreman because she thought she was .. better than 
a doll." Following a near-f.ual car accident around age 20, Boreman

returned to live with her family and soon thereafter met Charles 
Traynor, the man who would imprison her and force her into pros-
titution and pornography. 

As Boreman began co discuss Traynor, her maner-of-fact style 
became more personal, although it remained evident that her 
speech was scripted, and cliches often hung in the air. Nonetheless, 
the facrs of Boreman's story are moving and excruciating, and the 
tone of rage and humiliation in which she spoke ofTraynor lent her 
narration a power far beyond the script. So reman said that Traynor 
"acted like a complete gentleman and apple-pie American," and she 
moved in with him. Soon, however, he began to hold orgies in the 
downstairs bar he owned. 

Boreman decided to move out, but 
Traynor would not lee her. 

What ensued was "two years of imprisonment with mental, 
verbal, and physical abuse." Boreman told us, "I wasn't my own 
human being anymore." Traynor wouldn't let her out of his sight. 
He watched her go to the bathroom and held a gun to her head 
when she was on the phone. According to Boreman, Traynor 
believed that "a woman's body was made to be used and abused by 
a man." One day Traynor rook Boreman to a nearby Holiday Inn, 
where he forced her to have sex with five men, who labeled her 
Traynor's "new freak." As Boreman was "poked, touched, and 
probed in every nook and cranny," she began to cry, and one of the 
men told her to stop because she was reminding him of his daugh-
ter when her favorite doll broke. When Boreman narrated this 
event, she actually seemed like a frightened child. Tears gathered in 
her eyes, her voice faltered, and she had to look at MacKinnon for 
the encouragement to continue. 

Following the Holiday Inn incident, Traynor made a movie 
starring Boreman. Boreman, however, considers herself"the victim, 
not the star, of Dup Throat." Though she seemed 
aroused on screen, off-camera she was being ...:::.=---
beaten, threatened, and abused. 

Said 
Boreman, "So many people comment on the 
big smile on my face, but no one has asked 
me about my bruises." 

Boreman finally escaped ftom Traynor, 
but, despite many legal efforcs, she has not 
been ro bring him co justice. 

Unlike 
properry, which typica!Jy has a 20-30 year 
statute of limitation, damages inflicted on 
the human body can only be prosecuted for 
approximately three years. 

By the time 
Boreman had found psychological and 
legal help, the srarure had run out. 

Traynor remains free today. Boreman 
cold her shocked audience that when an 
interviewer recently asked Traynor 
whether he felt any remorse for his treat-
ment of her, he answered, "She ought to 
thank me for her one moment of glory." 


**Catharine MacKinnon: Pornography as Action, Not Speech**
**Page number(s): 24**

Catharine MacKinnon 
Catharine MacKinnon, a law professor at the University of 
Michigan, has been trying to bring Traynor ro justice and, on a larg-
er scale, working to bring an end to pornography. In many ways,

An outspo en s o ar 
e ieves pornography vto are 
women's civil rights, MacKinnon is clearly frustrated, embittered, 
and brilliant. A slender and domineering woman, she arrived ac 
Yale wearing a grey pantsuit, her long grey hair pulled back. 

Boreman, who seems co revere MacKinnon, followed shyly behind. 

Although MacKinnon's voice is far softer than I had expected from 
a radical feminist often denounced as strident, her presence quick-
ly filled the room. MacKinnon knew her large audience was mixed: 
some had come to praise her, others to challenge or condemn. This 
latter group was vocal during the questions following her talk, and 
MacKinnon, who had been eloquent and witty during che tea, sud-
denly grew hostile and snappy. She seems to see anyone who dis-
agrees with her, particularly any feminist, as a trairor, which no 
doubt isolates those who might support her (and doesn't help her 
already Limited popularity). 

From the start, MacKinnon's master's tea felt more like an aca-
demic seminar than an informal discussion. 

While Flynt and 
Strossen had played to their audiences, stating rheir views in an 
accessible manner peppered with popular sound bites, MacKinnon 
jumped immediately into obscure definitions, research findings, 
and theoretical constructs, although she was careful to add spo-
touches of humor to keep her audience engaged. Unlike 
most participants in the pornography debate, MacKinnon does 
not regard pornography as speech, but as action. Pornography 
A is the oppression of women, she maintains, not a harmless 
form of speech. 

MacKinnon argues that pornography acts against women 
twice-when it is made and when it is seen. She seeks to remind 
us that pornographic images are not static; there is a before 
and an after for every picture. First, as in Boreman's case, 
women are abused, raped, and degraded in the making 
of pornography. Then, many men who view pornogra-
phy similarly abuse, rape, and degrade women. 

D~~P 
Throat, says MacKinno~ , led many men co force women 
to try acts that Boreman had only done under hypnosis 
and coercion. For MacKinnon, then, pornography is nor 
about free speech; it is about freedom and equality, rhe 
freedom of women nor co be harmed rather chan the 
freedom of others to view pornography. Women and
