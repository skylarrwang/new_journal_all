purposes of real political dealings. 
Jacob's job description is straightforward. 

As Director of Government 
Relations for the University, he oversees 
and guides Yale's lobbying efforts 
with federal authorities in 
Yale's 
diet of federal money. 
As rhe chief in-
house lobbyist for one of America's most 
prominent universities, Jacob's task is to 
convince government of the need for an 
expanded investment in intellectual life. 
To partisans of small government and 
Washington . 
Jacob 
tracks issues befor~ 
Congress and the 
President that 
affect Yale in 
any 
way-
re searc h 
opportun i-
ties 
and 
po te nt ia l 
risks, budget 
debates, and 
controversy 
over everything 
from intellectual 
property and money 
for student loans to 
immigration 
policies that 
affect Yale's international students and 
scholars. He meets with representatives in 
Congress and federal agencies, never to dis-
cuss individual research grants but rather to 
lobby for larger research appropriations in 
general, from which Yale can expect to 
profit. Jacob also keeps up con nections 
with Connecticut'~ congressional delega-
tion, and especially with the "Yale delega-
tion" -
the 19 representatives and senators 
who graduated from Yale and whose doors, 
he says, are "that much more open to us 
when we need them." In addition to these 
duties, Jacob maintains ties with the gov-
ernment relations staffs of other research 
universities and a n umber of associations 
(most prominently the Association of 
American Universities) that exist to lobby 
on behalf of the education industry. 

According to mandatory lobbying 
rtpons filed with the C lerk of the House of 
Representatives, Jacob's office spends in the 
neighborhood of $3oo,o00-$38o,ooo each 
~ 
tracking issues and trends of concern 
to the University community. Jacob also 
relies upon Yale faculty an d administration, 
with whom he frequently travels to 
Washington for "common lobbying days" 
to discuss science and humanities policy 
with elected officials and federal agencies. 

Less straightforward are the strategies 
Jacob pursues in 9'1ainraining Yale's steady

arts and humani-
ties. To advocates 
of 
private 
fundraising and 
cost control, he 
m ust show that 
the public stands 
to gain much from 
the 
millions 
set 
aside every year for 
research and develop-
ment in esoterica. Not an 
easy task before the Congress 
that nearly killed off the National 
Endowment for the Arts for handing out 
taxpayer money to "self-proclaimed 'artists' 
whose mentality is just so much flotsam 
floating around in a sewer," in the words of 
Senator Jesse Helms. 

Jacob came to Yale in January 1995, a move 
that says something about recent develop-
ments in the dealings between government 
and academia. When Congress changed 
hands in 1994, a number of universities 
realized that many representatives who had 
long championed universities and research 
were now gone. 
After Newt Gingrich's 
notorious Contract with America, the 
peaceful relationship that existed between 
universities and the government changed 
greatly. 
Universities found themselves in 
need of new champions and acted accord-
ingly. 

Shortly after Jacob became Associate 
Vice President for Federal Relations in the 
Office of the General Counsel--only the 
second person to hold the position-Yale 
rook early steps to reestablish its position 
with Washington. The University stepped 
up its lobbying efforts and became a found-
ing member of a group called the Science 
Coalition, an alliance of 65 dues-paying 
research universities and several hundred 
scientific societies and professional associa-
tions. The Science Coalition aims to find
