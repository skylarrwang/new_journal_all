**Title: Pornography at Yale**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

Q ne nippy February night last winter, I donned my hat 
and scarf and set our for News Haven on a mission: to 
buy a copy of Hustkr magazine. Normally, Hustkr and other 
porn magazines would never have graced my shelves, stuffed as 
they were with books from classes such as Constitutional Law and 
The History of Feminist Thought and materials acquired the 
previous summer during an internship at the feminist magazine 
Ms. Bur I had to make an exception. The next day, I was ro 
interview Larry Flynt, the founder and publisher of Hustkr, 
and I'd yet to see a copy of his infamous magazine. 
Walking down Chapel Street, I felt ar once absurd and 
exhilarated. I'm not a fan of Flynt, but nonetheless I found the 
opportunity to interview a celebrity exciting. 
I entered News 
Haven and approached the porn section, where a motley group of 
men flipped through magazines. Others nervously avoided the 
area, pretending to study car and sports magazines, while darting 
eyes exposed their real interest. I was definitely out of place as I 
scanned the titles that peeked out &om tall plastic shields. 
When I found a copy of Hustkr, I paused to consider 
the purchase. On the one hand, I value free speech too 
highly, and hate censorship too much, to support a 
ban on pornography. On the other hand, I hold 
pornography responsible for objectifying and 
harming women and didn't want to make a $7.99 
contribution to the industry. As I approached 
the counter, my feminist instincts went into over· 
drive, and I grabbed a nearby copy of Ms.-
whether to offset my guilt about supporting 
Hustkr, or because I wanted the guy behind the 
counter to know that this was for research, I'm 
not sure. In any case, I paid for the magazines, 
received the brown paper bag that screamed ,
"PoRN" and set off back ro my dorm. 
Larry Flynt was visiting Yale for the first of four 
master's teas on pornography sponsored by Calhoun 
College. 
Calhoun Master William Sledge and 
Associate Master Betsy Sledge also invited American Civil 


Liberties Union (ACLU) President and law professor Nadine 
Strossen, former pornography actress Linda Boreman-betrer 
known as Linda Lovelace-and her attorney, law professor 
Catharine MacKinnon. Calhoun's guests have four of the loudest 
voices in the nation's pornography debate, and Yale had the rare 
honor of having them all speak :1~ part of a single series at a time 
when discussions of pornography can be found everywhere, from 
Internet chatrooms co Capitol Hill to university classrooms. The 
$ro billion-a-year pornography industry-larger than the music 
and movie industries combined-has been the subject of debate for 
centuries, but the controversy has exploded once again as the 
Internet redefines the way pornography is consumed and renders 
obsolete historical checks on its reach. 

But the Internet is not the only reason the pornography debate 
has grown more intense. Traditionally, there have been onJy two 
sides to the debate: civil libertarians, who argue that pornography 
should be protected as free speech, and social conservatives, who 
argue that pornography is obscene and should be banned. As the 
feminist movement emerged in the r970S, though, a new voice 
began to make itself heard, arguing that pornography was both a 
cause and an effect of sexual inequality. Unlike conservatives, who 
have made sex and sexuality their focus, feminists have concentrat-
ed on the degradation of women. Ironically, over the past few 
decades, conservatives and radical feminists have often united to 
work toward common goals. The pornography debate has become 
one of the most inceresting controversies in American political life, 
dividing some camps while forming unlikely coalition , 
ing itself as a matter of intellectual concern. 
A liberal college campus like Yale, then, was the 
for a series on pornography. 
Flynt, Strossen, Boreman, and 
MacKinnon-who represent the range of liberal views on pornog-
raphy, from hardcore civil libertarian to radical feminist-all made 
powerful arguments, invoking loaded words like freedom, censor-
ship, equality, and slavery to answer the question: Is pornography a 
hannless form of speech that should be protected by the First 
Amendment, or is it an active violation of women's civil rights that 
COntributes to their degradation, abuse, and subordination? 
After the series, I found myself returning to one of Flynt's 
analogies to understand both the participants' views and my own: 
"You can't have five hungry wolves and one sheep voting on what 
to have for supper, because the sheep is going to lose every time." 
While at Yale, Flynt invoked this analogy several times, concluding, 
"I know. I've been that sheep a few times." Although probably 
unintentional, this analogy summarizes the pornography debate 
quite well--as long as you leave the roles of wolf and sheep up for 
grabs. Flynt, Strossen, Boreman, and MacKinnon cast this role 
quite differently and form a strange pair of alliances in the debate; 
neither the feminist law professors nor the players in the pornogra-
phy industry agree with each other. Strossen and Flynt see the 
pornographer as a sheep needing protection from the wolves of 
majority-rule government and moralistic society. 
Boreman and 
MacKinnon, in contrast, argue that the sheep is a woman living in 
a patriarchy of wolves and brand Flynt and other pornographers 
wolves in sheep's clothing. 
Larry F1ynt 
When I met Larry Flynt in an Omni Hotel conference room, 
he gave me a quick once-over and guessed my age, correctly. I was 
courteous enough not to return the favor. Flynt, who has been in 
a wheelchair since he was shot twice in the abdomen in 1978, was 
rolled into the conference room by his stocky young attendant. 
Flynt's appearance and demeanor surprised me; he was not domi-
neering, as I had expected, but docile. He dressed his part-an 
ostentatious r 
d hij·s 
lumltger, and his large head sat 
on th

peaking is difficult or Flynt. He grumbles in low, hoarse 
tones, and has a hard time getting his words out, except when he 
eases into weU-rehearsed sound bites. Minutes into the interview, 
Flynt claimed provocatively that "the Church has had its hand on 
our crotch for over 2,000 years." Somehow, I wasn't as impressed 
as I had been when fd read this quote on the Web the night before. 
It lost even more power when I heard it the third time, later in the 
interview, and the fourth at the master's tea that afternoon. Flynt
