HousE in the Hill neighborhood of New 
Haven, a small group of mosdy college-
educated individuals lives in voluntary 
poverty, dedicating their time to serving 
the needs of the neighborhood. They 
engage in political activism to challenge 
what they see as the glorification of wealth, 
itS concentration in the hands of a few, and 
itS use to fund violent or wasteful policies. 
"We're really about non-violent revolution 
from the perspective of personalism [the 
belief that each person has a responsibility 
to work for the freedom and dignity of oth-
ers]," says Mark Colville, a founder of the 
Catholic Worker House in New Haven. 

For nearly 70 years the Catholic Worker 
Movement has been growing, and those 
involved believe that by building relation-
ships with the poor and sharing with others 
the fruitS of a good education, people can 
transform society. But is this mode of living 
the best use of an education to promote 
change? 

Today there are over 140 Catholic 
Worker Houses and communes in the 
United States. Colville and his wife Luz 
founded the New Haven Catholic Worker 
House in July 1994. In order tO pass on to 
their children their deep belief in the digni-
ty of all people, the Colvilles quit their jobs 
and moved to Rosette Street in the impov-
erished Hill neighborhood to begin a bouse 
of hospitality where anyone in need is wel-
come. 

Many of the values that moved the 
Colvilles to found the house were first 
articulated in 1933 by Dorothy Day, a radi-
cal leftist journalist, and Peter Maurin, a 
French immigrant who saw in Catholic 
social teachings a call for societal transfor-
mation. They began to publish The 
Catholic WOrker, a newspaper reporting on 
struggles for social justice both here and 
abroad. Their teachings inspired followers 
to form f.ums, communes, and houses of 
hospitality, which together comprise a 
deliberately decentralized movement. 

T he Colvilles wanted to live in a 
Catholic Worker House in solidarity with 
the poor, as Mark says, "to walk with them 
for a while and see what became of that." 
The House subsistS on donations from 
restaurantS and supermarketS, and any food 
above and beyond the needs of the 
Colvilles and the other house occupantS is 
distributed to the community. All mone-
tary income goes into a collective fund; no 
one living in the house receives regular 
wages. Over time, residentS in the neigh-
borhood have recognized the house as a 
place to go for help, a free meal, or a place 
to stay for a few days. 

Colville explains that there is a deep 
belief in Catholic Worker communities 
that possessions should be held in com-
mon. Things people have beyond what 
they need, he says, are stolen from the poor 
and rightfully belong ro them. Therefore, 
giving to the needy is not a remarkable act: 
It is to be expected. Colville claims that 
being in a position to perform "works of 
mercy" -regular actS that physically and 
spiritually aid others, such as teaching or 
caring for the sick-is itself a privilege, one 
that has to be earned and justified by strug~ 
gling publicly against injustice. Thus, for 
him, non-violent political activism, such as 
protesting us sanctions in Iraq or refusing
