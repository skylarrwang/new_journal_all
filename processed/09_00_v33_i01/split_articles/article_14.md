0 EDUCATION 
compromise a liberal education? 
By Ronen Givony 
Over the past 25 years, as competitions for grant money have 
grown fiercer and more federal grant programs have withered in the 
name of balanced budgets, many schools have moved to better posi-
tion themselves within the political arena. Following the lead of 
corporate America, universities have formed associations and enlist-
ed lobbyists to ensure their share of lucrative gov-
ernment research contracts. Borrowing a tactic of 
corporate culture, they have begun to think of 
their "products" -
learning and research-as a 
kind of asset, measurable in dollar amounts and 
traditional conceJ:ltions of risk and return. They 
speak of federal funding of medical research as an 
investment, of education as a cog in the wheel of 
economic prosperity. To justify their annual 
research budgets, universities today are forced to 
sell their product, much like corporate lobbyists 
market their industries, as deserving of federal dollars and contracts. 
The practice of university lobbying says a great deal about the stakes 
and rules of the research spending game today, about the image that 
universities must present, and about the strategies they use to ensure 
funding in a time of fiscal conservatism. 

In the past three decades, no university has had a more inti-
mate relationship with the leaders of the federal government than 
Yale, and few have benefited more consistently from the blue-chip 
stock of reputation. But Yale's successes are neither paraded nor 
particularly well-known to those outside the University communi-
ty. Plenty of schools receive considerably more research money 
than Yale; schools such as Caltech and M.I.T. have long been known 
as important centers for federal and especially defense-related 
research. 

Still others spend dramatically more on lobbying and 
campaign contributions. Yale is significant, rather, for the singular 
efficiency of its rather modest efforts, and for the model it sets for 
universities of its lcind-schools with an avowed commitment to a 
liberal arts education whose aims in scholarship might seem at odds 
with the rules of the federal spending game. 

A river of federal money runs through the Yale campus. It begins 
with the School of Medicine and its affiliates on the southern side 
of town, pushes north to the Schools of Art, Architecture, and 
Drama, winds its way around Prospect and Hillhouse, and proceeds 
steadily toward Science Hill and the School of Forestry. Along the 
way it makes numerous detours· in departments 
of the physical, natural, and political sciences; in 
economics, international relations, and area 
studies; in math and computer science; and even-
tually all the way down to the most quotidian 
aspects ofYale student life, like e-mail access via 
high-speed network connections. In the words 
of one University official, "Yale couldn't be what 
it is today if it were relying just on endowment 
income and tuition." 

In the words of one 
University official, «Yale 
couldn,t be what it is 
today if it were relying 
just on endowment 
income and tuition., 

The numbers are impressive. For fiscal year 
1998, Yale received $233 million in grant and contracts, or "spon-
sored agreement income," from Washington. By 1999, this figure 
had risen to $244 million, and in 2000, to over $260 million. 

According to the Office of Finance and Administration, Yale pro-
jects federal revenues of some $284 million and a steady growth rate 
of 7·9 percent for fiscal year 2001. The School of Medicine, which 
accounts for about 50 percent of the University's budget, receives 
approximately 75 percent of Yale's grant income. And while the 
National Institutes of H ealth (NIH) continue to provide the lion's 
share of these revenues ($190 million in 1999), other agencies-
including the Departments of Energy, Defense, and Education-
still provide $40 million on an annual basis. 

Yale received its first offer of government money in 1919, when 
the u.s. Interdepartmental Social Hygiene Board offered the School 
of Medicine--then the "Medical Department" -a check for $5,100 
to participate in research activities.
