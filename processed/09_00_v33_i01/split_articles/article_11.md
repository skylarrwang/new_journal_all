to pay federal taxes because, he claims, they 
fund war-making, is closely connected to 
community se~ce, and is necessary to 
~nsure that charitable works do not simply 
patch up the holes of a social system that 
leaves millions destitute, Colville explains. 


The convictions of Catholic Worker 
House members appeal to many college 
activists, especially those in depressed areas 
who have difficulty reconciling their costly 
educations at expensive schools with the 
conditions that surround them. Brant, a 
recent graduate of Fairfield University, is 
one of several college students who have 
chosen to reside in the Cesar Jerez House 
over the past six years. Students say they 
have not only shared the experience of vol-
untary poverty and service, but have also 
been challenged to think deeply about the 
value of their education. The Colvilles and 
others in the Catholic Worker Movement 
question the common perception of educa-
tion as a vehicle for self-advancement. 
"There's a great societal pull to use educa-
tion for personal power in an oppressive 
way," asserts Mark. "In this society we're 
very isolated and insulated. The system 
leads us to not be in connection with other 
people." In contrast, Colville believes that 
we have a responsibility to put our educa-
tion, as a valuable possession, to the service 
of others in a concrete way, and he encour-
ages students to find a means to do so. 
But is it really possible to share a 
$130,ooo education with others, and is 
moving into a community such as the 
Cesar Jerez house the best way to do so? 
Students agree that finding a concrete 
means of sharing one's education is not 
always easy. Yale senior Johnny Scafidi, 
who spent the summer in the house, found 
that living there and having lengthy con-
versations with people in the community 
about philosophy and theology were valu-
able means of imparting some of what he 
had learned in college. He says that he, too, 
gained a great deal from hearing stories of 
the people around him. Mackenzie Baris, 
another Yale senior, found it more difficult 
at times to apply her Yale education in a 
practical manner, but she still felt that her 


education contributed to the life of the 
community: "What I think I shared with 
the people in the community, especially the 
children, was that this !Ond of education is 
worthwhile and possible. It's important for 
kids to see that Yale students would want to 
live on their street."
