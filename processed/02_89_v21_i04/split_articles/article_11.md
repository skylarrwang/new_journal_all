It's not easy to 
transcend all the 
'cynicism and defenses 
of adulthood, and

so much more than you expected. You 
were just curious, and now you've 
gone and ruined things. You feel that 
you are to blame, and you don't want 
to feel that way at all. 

And now you get angry. Because 
whose fault is this situation anyway? 
After all, you..didn't ask this misguided 
woman to sit sorrowfully beside you, 
mourning for your soul. You look once 
again at Debbie's crushed Ping-Pong-
ball face, and your anger peaks. You 
aren't going to take responsibility for 
~someone so fragile. And what about all 
the others, with their upturned faces, 
innocent as the day they were born? 

Then you remember a passage you 
once learned. "Suffer the little children 
to come unto me," you recite to your-
self. "Of such is the kingdom of God." 
And suddenly, you think you under-
stand the whole problem. This whole 
thing, this whole Born Again thing, is 
about childhood: cake you give up 
without asking why, undiscriminating 
friendliness to total strangers, the 
clapping and singing and carrying on 
right down to that cartoon booklet. 

But then you ta~ a moment to calm 
down. They're a funny 
sort of 
children- children who have lived 
adult lives. They read newspapers; 
they fill out tax returns. Some of them 
might be alcoholics. Some of the 
women might have been raped. And 
still they can raise up their hands to 
heaven, and still they can smile, and 
still they can pray. As simple as it 
seems, this Born Again stuff isn't easy 
at all. It's not easy to transcend all the 
cynicism and defenses of adulthood, 
and believe. 

And now, more than ever, you know 
you would never be able to do it. You 
would never be able to summon up 
that second innocence. Amid your 
questions and your doubts you could 
never fit in such absolute belief. And 
isn't it funny that what you learned at 
the Potter's House Christian Center is 
not how much you do believe but how 
much you don't? 

You feel exhausted, wiped out, as if 
you had spent these two-and-a-half 
hours in tears. As you head for the 
door, hands reach out to you, offering 
pamphlets. One woman gives you her 
phone number- in case you have any 
questions or just want to talk. But she's 
a believer, and you are not. And 
though you appreciate the effort, you 
know you will never call.
