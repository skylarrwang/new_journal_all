Reverdy values a book's aesthetics in 
addition to its historical novelty and 
literary merit. For him, a good book 
comes out of the marriage of a master-
ful printer and a 
skillful binder. 

Talking to a prospective customer 
about an early edition of a Dickens 
novel, Reverdy describes the volume 
as if it were alive. "It's pages are firm, 
and the binding is tight," he says. 
"'there was a slight crack in the cover 
skin, but it's been healed." Reverdy 
believes that the cover of a book 
protects and preserves the spirit of its 
writer. "Some writers put their soul in 
their books," Reverdy says, "and some 
expose the souls of others."

**Title: Home Repair**
**Author: Andrea Assarat**

The morning after Christmas, 56 
children from Waterbury, Connecticut 
quietly climbed out of several vans 
onto the campus of a local col-
lege. They were between the ages of 
seven and twelve; most were white, the 
rdt either black or Latino. Many of the 
campers. who would spend the next five 
days tog(!ther, did not yet know one 
another. 
but all 
had already 
shared one experience: They had been 
abused by their parents. 

Joan(Kaufman (GRD '90), a fifth-
year psychology graduate student, 
designed Camp Winterfest to measure 
the effect of parental abuse and neglect 
on children's development. With the 
results of her study, she will recom-
mend specific changes in the state 
services for maltreated children. The 
idea for the study became a reality 
when K aufman won a $90,000 grant 
from the Smith-Richardson Found-
anbn. T his award was the largest that 
any psychology graduate student at 
Yale had ever received. Kaufman got 
Started right away. Two months before 
the camp, she advertised at Yale for 12 
assistant counselors. 
The state's 
Department of Children and Youth 
Services (DCYS) referred families to 
the camp. 

Early in the first day, the campers 
divided into groups by age and pro-
ceeded to their scheduled classes in 
cooking, art, gym, and music. For one to 
two hours during the day Kaufman 
adminstered tests to determine each 
child's. emotional, psychological, and 
intellectual development. She asked 
questions like, "Do you have a lot of 
friends?" and "Do you ever think of 
hurting yourself?" Kaufman also tried 
to observe their natural behavior in 
play situations. 
But according to 
assistant· counselor Pramil Singh (BR 
'91), "Ultimately her goal was that the 
kids have fun. If any of the experi-
mental aspects were disruptive, then 
she wanted us to forget it." 

That wasn't necessary. Singh found 
that the children _actually enjoyed 
taking the tests. But the work was still 
serious. To ensure that her assistants 
didn't influence the ~· resu l ts with any 
preconceptions, she led the counselors 
to believe that only half the children 
had been maltreated and the others 
were part of a control group. To add 
depth 
to 
her study, 
Kaufman 
interviewed the children's parents and 
teachers; she also consulted their 
medical records. 

K aufman will have finished analyzing 
the information by April. Until then, 
she hesitates to make any definite 
conclusions. She does, however, affirm 
that the children in the program are at 
least one to two years behind aca-
demically. Although all the tests were 
designed for an eight-year-old's level of 
comprehension, Charles Henrickson 
(SY '91), an assistant counselor in 
charge of the 11-and 12-year-old boys, 
found that many of his counselees had 
trouble reading and understanding the 
questions. Once Kaufman completes 
her report, she will be able to help state 
officials improve programs for these 
children. But for now, they have 
returned home.
