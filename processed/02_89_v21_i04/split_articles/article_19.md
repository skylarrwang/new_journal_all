tionships with playwrights whose work 
he then helps develop. "One of the 
most wonderful things that can happen 
is to discover someone whose thoughts 
and artistry are parallel to your own," 
Richards says. One such discovery was 
Athol Fugard, a white South African 
who writes about people in a society 
dominated and defined by apartheid. 
Since 1979 the Rep has produced 
seven Fugard plays, including three 
world premiers. "One of my reasons 
for being in the theater is that it gives 
me a platform from which to articulate 
my own feelings, my own thoughts, 
my own concerns," Richards says. 
Although he puts the playwright at the 
rhetorical center, Richards silently 
places himself right alongside. 
Armed only with a foot locker full of 
possessions, a degree in theater from 
Wayne University of Detroit, and a 
Veterans' Entitlement to S20 per week. 
Richards arrived in New York City in 
194-8. Work was not plentiful for black 
actors, and he joined what he calls the 
"artistic circle of the unemployed." He 
also joined a group of young black 
newcomers to the theater that included 
Lorraine 
Hansberry and 
Douglas 
Turner Ward. In a world that offered 
blacks 
few 
opportunities 
in 
the 
theatrical mainstream, many in this 
group were to make their careers by 
founding black 
theaters for black 
audiences. Ward, director of the 
Negro Ensemble Company, asked 
Richards to direct various plays during 
the 1960's. Richards turned him down, 
choosing instead to work towards 
opening white theater to the black 
experience. His big stage successes 
have been in historically white venues, 
and his TV work has been mostly on 
black 
projects 
accepted by 
white 
audiences, such as a segment of Roots. 
"Richards has tended not to create a 
separate black institution, as many of 
his contemporaries did, but to bring 
black voices into white institutions," 
says Caroline Jackson (TC '74). dirc~c­

white world," Richards says. "For me 
to say that that does not either concern 
or affect me would b e both ridiculous 
and untrue. It does. I am concerned 
that persons of different backgrounds 
• find a way to relate, to interrelate, and 
to create as well as to share." Richards 
has demonstrated these concerns at the 
Drama School by opening up the 
school to a greater number of minority 
students. "His being here is a great 
source of inspiration and pride," one 
black student says, 
although she 
complains that even now there is a 
"quota mentality" at the school. She 
says that every year three black 
actors-two men, one woman- are 
admitted to a class of 16. Another 
student, also a black woman, questions 
this unofficial quota. "Can't there ever 
be six black acting students in a class 
here?" she asks. But she says, "If there's 
a certain amount of sadness, there's a 
certain amount of gratitude as well." 
For Richards, the theater door 
opened after Sidney Poitier was offered 
a role in Raisin, his first on Broadway, and 
pushed for Richards as director. Bonds
