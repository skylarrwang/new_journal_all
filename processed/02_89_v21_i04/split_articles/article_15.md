Victor cried silently in his sleeping bag 
whenever it got really tough. His 
whole body hurt and he smelled bad. 
Hiking ~p and down steep hills was 
hard enough, but he also had to carry a 
heavy pack, dig latrines, and ward off 
bullying threats from Tyrone. At 
times, Victor hated everyone in his 
group so much he would not speak for 
an entire day. The food was terrible, 
he missed his family, and he was often 
cold and wet. On these miserable 
nights, he would bitterly recall the lies 
of his buddy Cesar, who had told him 
that the Wilderness School was like a 
vacation- fishing and basketball every 
day. 


Victor Acevedo is what social work-
ers in Connecticut call a "youth at 
risk." At 17, he has twice been on 
probation, and his principal at New 
Haven's Wilbur Cross High School has 
repeatedly suspended him for fighting. 
Every summer, about 130 Connecticut 
youths 
like Victor enroll 
in the 
Wilderness School. Many of them 
have behavior problems or under-
achieve in school, according to the 
program's current annual report. 
About half of the students have drug or 
alcohol dependencies, and a quarter 
receive psychiatric treatment. For 20 
days the teenagers live together m 
small groups in the backwoods of 
Connecticut, trying very hard to 
believe in the school's credo that 
physical hardship builds character. 


The challenge can seem severe, 
especially to those teenagers who have 
always lived in a city. Victor had never 
been in the woods. He had never slept 
on the ground or even cooked a meal. 
And he had certainly never lived so 
closely with 11 other people. Leading the 
group were two instructors trained in 
outdoor skills and juvenile delinquent 
rehabilitation- one was a former Wil-
derness School student. Together the 
team plodded through the rain, slept 
under tarps, and fought like hell with 
each other. There were no bloody 
noses, though; the instructors allowed 
only yelling and screaming. "Me and 
Tyrone, we hated each other," Victor 
recalled. "I wanted to punch his face 
in. There's a lot of stress-you get 
Â·angry." About a week into the course, 
Victor had had enough. He was home-
sick, exhausted. He wanted out. 


Victor had his so-called friend Cesar 
to blame for turning him on to the 
program, but there was another culprit 
as well. Thomas Morrissey, a New 
Haven police officer, hooked Victor up 
with the Wilderness School. He also 
secured a grant from the New Haven 
Foundation to pay Victor's $800 tui-
tion. Morrissey, a referral agent for 
the school, sends more teenagers into 
the woods than any other single agent. 
For the past 12 years, he has obtained 
enough grant money to sponsor four 
New Haven teenager!! every summer. 


In the early 1970's, Morrissey was 
one of a number of reformers who saw 
the need for creative ways of han~ing 
youths at risk. In 1974, the Con-
necticut Department of Corrections 
responded to this need by founding the 
Wilderness School. The agency de-
signed the program 
to work 
in 
conjunction with established youth-
service organizations such as coun-
seling centers and detention homes. 
These organizations refer students to 
the wilderness program and perform 
follow-up counseling after the teen-
agers return to civilization. Based out 
of an old scouting camp in Goshen, 
near the Berkshires in northwestern 
Connecticut, the school has access to
