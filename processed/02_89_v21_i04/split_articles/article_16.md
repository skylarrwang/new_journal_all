Officer Thomas Morrissey convinced Victor Acevedo that walking the 
high rope is better than suspension from school.


The Connecticut Wilderness School, nestled in the Litchfield hills, offers 
a challenging outdoor program for troubled teenagers.  Many social workers 
refer their difficult cases to the school, including Officer Thomas Morrissey 
of the New Haven Police Department.  Morrissey began sending referrals 
to the school five years ago.  The school is set on 1,000 acres with miles of 
wooded trails, rock climbing 
areas, and a navigable river. 

The outdoor skills taught during the 
course 
build 
self-confidence, 
foster 
teamwork, 
and provide construc-
tive challenges. Many social workers

mirror the 
findings of 
professionals. A study conducted at 
Yale 
in 
1975 by Dr. 
Solomon 
Cytrynbaum found that the program 
helps students with 
their "social 
functioning, drug and alcohol abuse, 
[and] legal difficulties." 

Such rewards do not come easily. 
Morrissey tries to make sure his 
referrals know exactly what they are 
getting into. On his patrol, Morrissey 
finds kids who he thinks would make 
good candidates for the Wilderness 
School. He approaches them with a 
challenge: "H ey kid, you think you're 
pretty tough. Let's see if you can do 
something constructive." He chooses 
the final group very carefully, pre-
selecting them for success. They have 
to want to go and they have to want to 
change. About half the applicants back

climbing, he says. As an agent, 
Morrissey drives his referrals to 
Goshen where he helps them design 
personal 
goals 
for 
the course. 
When Victor set out 
into the 
woods, 
his 
main 
goal 
was 
to '-'understand people without using 
violence." Many students had similar 
aims. The instructors held campfire 
therapy sessions each night to help 
everybody get along during the px:o-
gram. 

The wilderness, however, is not for 
everyone. About one out of ten stu路 
dents ends up leaving the program 
early each year. One of Morrissey's 
referrals had to leave the course three 
days in: He had a bullet in his leg from 
a shooting on his street the night before 
he had left. He hadn't wanted to tell his 
instructors because he was afraid they 
would send him home. 

But Victor stayed. A girl named 
Tammy, from Hartford, talked him 
into sticking it out. He says he was 
amazed that someone cared about him 
enough to want him around. Even-
tually, all the campers started getting 
along better. Even Tyrone could be a 
nice guy. "After every fight, we were a 
little closer," Victor explained. "We'd 
fight, we'd make up, we'd be better 
friends." Learning to trust others is 
essential to the program, according to 


With students from a wide diversity 
of ethnic and geographic backgrounds, 
the school provides an intense cultural 
experience. "It's more realistic that 
way." said Dyer, a former therapist 
now working full-time for the school. 
Morrissey thinks the friendships that 
develop in the outdoors create feelings 
that stay with the teenagers a long 
time. "On the course, you've got to 
concentrate and have confidence," he 
explained. "These kids say to them-
selves, 'H ey, I am somebody- I can 
hook up with a team and we can all be 
somebodies together.' It makes you feel 
like you're not a loner out there." 

Victor knew he had friends he could 
trust when he tried climbing a granite 
cliff. The first stretch was easy, and he 
did well as long as he didn't look down. 
But halfway up the rock wall, he froze . 
He was terrified. With his toes trem-
bling on the rock, he couldn't find a 
higher 
place 
to 
put 
hands. 
\\'atching from below, the others saw 
him stop and began chanting his 
name. "They were cheerin~- every-
body, Tammy, Tyrone." Victor kept 
going, eyes partially closed. When he 
came back down, he felt great. "I never 
felt better in my whole life. I looked 
up, and said, 'I did that!"' 

During the high ropes section of the 
course, Victor found himself once 
again above solid ground. Harnessed 
to a climbing rope, he set out to cross a 
ravine by walking along one suspended 
cord and holding onto another. The 
others before him had deliberately 
jumped off halfway across, taking a 
trust fall, and then hoisting themselves 
back up. Victor was determined not to 
take the plunge. But when he got out 
there and looked into the expectant 
faces of those on the other side, he took 
a deep breath and let go. After dang-
ling by the rope for a few seconds, 
Victor climbed back up and continued 
across. 

One of the toughest course require-
ments came near the end. The cam-
pers were supposed to stay alone in one 
area for two days with only a tarp, a 
small handful of food, a pad of paper, 
and a pen. They were to use the time 
and solitude to think about improving 
their lives. Victor did what most 
students do: He ate all his food the first 
morning and then fasted the next day. 
"The scariest thing about it was the 
wild animals," he said.
