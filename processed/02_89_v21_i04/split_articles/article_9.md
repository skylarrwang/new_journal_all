Test of Faith 
It seems so easy to become a Born 
Again Christian, so very easy. Just leaf 
through the booklet, Ben Born Again's 
New Believer's Growth Book. Complete 
with cartoon illustrations, it outlines 
everything you need to know. 

YOU 
NEED TO DO FOUR · 
THINGS TO RECEIVE CHRIST: 
( 1) ADMIT your spiritual need. That's 
simple enough. You might not even 
know you've done it. Just saunter 
· down the block to the New Haven 
Green one Saturday afternoon. There, 
following the last strains of an Evan-
gelical rock band, a voice lures you to 
the grandstand with its scintillating 
cry, 
"This is 
the generation of 
fornication." And just by sitting down 
to listen , 
you've 
admitted some 
need- at least according to Troy, who 
comes right up to you, no last name, 
just a regular guy there to help you on 
your way. This young, black ex-
serviceman crouches down to your 
eye level and tells you about the 
greatest change in 
his 
life, 
acceptance of Christ. He starts by 
telling you about his life before: seven 
years in the army, a college degree in 
chemistry, ego, pride, neglect of his 
wife and kids, hatred of white people, 
black people, Puerto Ricans. Then his 
life after: love, a relationship with 
Jesus, letting Jesus into his heart. He 
points to his six-year-old leaping on the 
grass to explain how Jesus helped him 
accept the world he had hated. When 
Troy tells his son "no more cake," the 
boy asks, "Why?" But he has to accept 
his father's authority on the subject, 
just as Troy must 
accept God's 
authority and trust that He knows 
what's best. 

While you just take it easy, listening 
and nodding, Troy starts to read to 
you from the Kingjames Bible, glancing 
up periodically with his solemn eyes to 
catch your expression. He reads from 
the Gospel according to John and then 
says, "When that Word shot out of His 
mouth, it had to be at the speed of 
light, right? Scientists have found that 
it's still expanding." And maybe Troy's 
talking a little over your head, but if 
that statement doesn't pique your 
curiosity, what would? So when it's 
time to go, you accept the card Troy 
thrusts into your hand and rf:ad the 
words "Potter House Christian Center, 
!;ervices Sunday at 5:30." And Troy 
tells you, "Call me if you ever need a 
ride or anything." 

So why not .go, just to see? Why not 
go right to the source? Which in this 
case means driving on a Sunday 
evening to Bridgeport, half an hour 
away. Young mothers greet you on the 
low, cement porch, keeping an eye on 
the children as they toddle about the 
parking lot in front of the one-room 
building- someone says it used to be a 
pizza parlor. And there you are, ·telling< 
them you came because you met Troy 
yesterday in the park, implying that 
you are there to: 
.\. 
(2) REPENT and be willing to turn 
from your sins, 
which seems easy 
enough, with the women on the porch 
welcoming you so warmly, telling you 
their names, informing you that Troy's


probably inside praym g. They ask you 
about the Green-did you hear the 
bands and have you ever heard music 
like that before in your life? But that 
question isn't so easy to a nswer because 
you don't know what to say. The music 
had sounded pretty mediocre to you; 
still, you don't want to be rude. So you 
just keep quiet and find that soon 
they're letting you inside. 

Inside the house people make you 
feel right at home. A large, balding, 
white man dressed in a watery-gray 
~it sees you at once a nd comes over, 
just trying to be helpful. While he 
starts in on the story o f his conversion 
you can't help taking a quick look 
around, taking in the white walls and 
brightly lacquered wooden rafters, the 
60-or-so folding chairs arranged facing 
!he pulpit. A young Latino couple sits 
Jn the front row. The mother, maybe 
~0 years old, holds a grimacing baby 
Jn one arm, its bottle resting by her 
foot. The balding, white man points to 
a map dotted with little red spots that 
mark Born Agatn 
congregations 
around the world. H e mentions that 
their regular pastor has gone to the 
Philippines for a few weeks to spread 
~e Good News. On a large screen 
hanging from the rafters behind him, 
You see the lyrics to the first song of the 
~rvice appearing first reversed, then 
nght-side-up. ' In the opposite corner 
You spot Troy picking up one of two 
electric guitars leaning beside a large 
drum set. 

T hen on some familiar cue the 
balding man ushers you to a chair, and 
the whole place explodes into move-
ment and sound. About 50 voices 
challenge organ, drum, and guitar, 
and a hundred elbows jerk rhyth-
mically in and out, clapping with the 
beat. Swept up in their energy, you 
clap along. From all sides, people smile 
at you, and you smile back. A tiny girl 
with straight, dark hair and wide-open 
eyes sits extremely upright a nd claps 
with sheer excitement. She looks at 
you gaily and you smile broadly, 
hoping she won't notice that you're just 
pretending. And soon you don't have 
time to think - about sin or repentance 
or looking like you belong- because 
things start happening. The instru-
ments drop out and the congregation 
rises. The clapping builds and builds 
until it bursts into hands reaching 
toward the heavens a nd 
voices 
exhorting and exulting and then melts 
into a second volley of claps, propelling 
the gesticulating mass through another 
cycle of prayer . While doing your part 
with an occasional clap, clap you 
attempt to decipher the cries: "Praise 
Jesus," "Praise God," "Hail Jesus.• A 
man behind you calls out in syllables 
you've never heard, and you realize he 
must be speaking in tongues. Through 
the waving arms, you glimpse Tro}'
