The lounge of the Yale Club of New 
York City has many handsome wood 
tables. H eavy curtains on the windows 
have trapped a pleasant smell of pipe 
tobacco. The room is quiet; most of the 
members read newspapers taken from 
the selection on the tables, and a few 
people converse in low voices. The 
walls, ornamented with Ionic pilasters, 
reflect a certain warmth even when the 
fireplaces are empty. This is where 
~ alumni hang out. 

The setting differs vastly from the 
archetypical college haunt, where 
wood tables are meant for carving and 
the smoke in the air comes from 
cigarettes. Many undergraduates who 
visit the Yale Club feel ill at ease: To 
them it is "alumni-land," an intimi-
dating place where the Yale society of 
long-ago gather to drink Scotch and 
read the Wall Street Journal. Yet every 
year roughly 250 graduates, fresh from 
college, become members. 

H aving recently come from the 
young, predominantly liberal envi- ~ 
ronment of Yale, they are greeted by 
the older, predominantly conservative 
environment of the Yale Club. Their 
college years are still too fresh to 
inspire sighs of nostalgia; friends know 
each other's immediate plans and have 
not lost contact. When young mem-
bers go to the club, it is generally more 
in anticipation than in reminiscence. 

These new alumni realize that the Yale 
Club is more than a place to eat, drink, 
and play squash. It is a symbol of a 
specific lifestyle: very comfortable, 
very proper, very Yale. This image has 
a touch of the anachronistic. School 
mottos carved above the fireplaces, 
strict requirements for dress, and the 
upkeep of old school ties create an 
atmosphere some members feel reflects 
Yale's worthy traditions, and others, its 
elitism. 

The Yale Club of New York was 
+ created in 1897 "to promote the 
frequent meeting together of Yale 
men," according to 
the original 
Certificate of Incorporation. The club 
occupied two other buildings before 
moving in 1915 to Vanderbilt Avenue 
right next to Grand Central Station. 
The new building cost $1 million to 
build. It was the world's largest private 
club at the time, and it is still the 
largest college club. By the early 
Forties women were admitted as 
guests; by 1974 they could become 
members. The present club has 9,400 
members, and it serves not only 
Yale alumni, but those of Dartmouth 
College and Delta Kappa Epsilon 
fraternity as well. 

In order to join, all applicants must 
present two recommendations from 
current members. In the spring of their 
senior year, however, undergraduates 
receive an invitation to join the club 
without the usual recommendations. If 
they apply by the following September, 
they can forego the five-and-a-half 
week waiting period and just pay the 
dues. Dues stan at S50 per quarter-
year for those living in New York City, 
but increase to as much as S173. 75 per 
quarter over the next eight years, to 
match an anticipated rise in income. 

Members have access to a wide 
range of facilities: There is a library, 
various dining rooms, several bars, a gym, 
squash courts, and a Turkish bath, as 
well as the lounge. But the majority of 
the club's 22 floors contain hotel rooms 
for out-of-town members. Lectures 
-often by Yale professors- mixers, 
and special events, 
sometimes 
featuring Yale singing groups, keep 
the atmosphere from becoming too 
quiet. And there are always the weekly 
films of old Yale football games. 

Although sometimes opting out of 
these activities, recently graduated 
students make good use of the club's 
facilities. "For someone our age, the 
main reason to go would be the athle-
tics," Andy Cawker (SY '87) said. The 
gym is well-equipped and cheaper than 
most health clubs. The atmosphere has 
its own kind of appeal. "The gym is 
mellow," said Colin Weil (SM '88). 
"It's not the singles-bar scene that most 
health clubs are." While riding the 
exercycles, 
for example, 
members 
divert their attention by watching the 
TV rather than each other. 

Use of these facilities costs extra, but
