A Tight Reign 
When violence erupted during a rap 
concert at the New Haven Coliseum a 
year-and-a-half ago, two of the city's 
mounted police officers, Sergeant Ed 
Clough and Officer Marvin Marable, 
.-ealized they would need help. They 
radioed two colleagues to assist them as 
4,000 fans .spilled into the streets. The 
50 foot-patrol officers on duty were 
unable to break up the throng, but 
riding side-by-side, the four horse 
patrolmen split and dispersed the 
crowd within five minutes. 
T his incident proved the effec-
tiveness of the New Haven Mounted 
Unit (NH MU), which was founded in 
1983

divisions; the horse patrol was the first 
of its kind in Connecticut. At present, the 
unit consists of seven horses and six men 
and is based in a converted eight-car 
garage in Edgerton Park off of Whit-
ney Avenue. 
The horse unit provides a visibility 
and mobility that car and foot patrols 
lack. "A purse snatcher, seeing an 
officer on horseback, will think twice 
about committing a crime," explained 
Marable, the first policeman to join the 
NHMU. "Most of the kids run like 
deers out there, and without a horse I 
couldn't run them down." Horses also 
enable police to patrol parks and woods 
on thc;ir own. But in the city, if a 
criminal ducks into a building or takes 
off in a car, the mounted police will call 
for auto and foot assistance. 
Beyond their regular beats, the 
mounted police are indispensible for 
crowd control. Whenever the police 
department expects a large crowd, it 
sends the horses into action. Among 
other events, the NHMU patrols foot-
ball games at the Yale Bowl and 
concerts on the New Haven Green. 
Two mounted patrols were assigned to 
the Yale campus during the labor 
union strikes in 1984, and a horse 
patrol unit accompanied Governor 
Michael D ukakis at his Wooster Street 
rally last fall. 
This schedule tests the stamina and 
skills of horse and rider. Both must 
undergo a rigorous training program 
to join the unit. Officers in the police 
force may apply to the NHMU only 
after two years of regular duty. If 
accepted, they must learn skills such as 
maneuvering through rush hour traf-
fic and shooting at targets from the back 
of 
a 
cantering 
horse.

training in New Haven. 
The officers usually pass this course 
in two months, but their horses' 
training never ends. Conditioning for 
the horses begins on an obstacle course 
in Edgerton Park and continues in the 
city's quieter 
neighborhoods. 
The 
horses eventually 
patrol a 
beat 
downtown where they must confront 
the noises and distractions of the city. 
The NHMU, recognizing the strain 
put on the horses, continually monitors 
the fitness and health of its animals. 
But despite this care, some horses have 
become ill or uncontrollable. "Quite a 
few horses just aren't suited for life in 
the city," said Clough, the head of the 
division. "I don't take Appaloosas and 
Thoroughbreds anymore. They're all a 
little too crazy. I find we're having our 
best luck with Quarter Horses and 
Saddlebreds." 
Last October the NHMU had an 
opportunity to test its mettle in the fifth 
annual Police Equestrian Competition 
in Washington, D.C. The New Haven 
Police Department sent four officers 
and their horses to compete against 74 
other mounted police, including repre-
sentatives from the FBI, the U.S. 
Army, and the Secret Service, who 
rode the President's horses. In one 
series of tests, the riders had to keep 
their mounts within a 4 ft. by 8 ft. 
chalked rectangle while judges 
operated jackhammers and chainsaws, 
lit flares, and jumped out of sleeping 
bags. Competitors acquired penalty 
points if their horses shied beyond the 
rectangle's boundaries. New Haven's 
unit won second place behind the team 
from the National Park Service, which 
owns over 3,000 horses. 
On more typical days, NHMU offi-
. cers must clean the riding equipment, 
horses, and stables. "You really have to 
like horses. There's a lot of work 
involved and you spend a lot of time 
with them," explained Officer Robert 
Peryer. "There's no regrets in this 
barn." Peryer latched his horse's stall 
door and dragged away a full manure 
bucket.

On Reserve 
A student reading the Yale Daily News 
in the early part of the century may not 
have noticed the small announcements 
stating that "The Smartest Dressers are 
Wearing Monocles Now" and that 
Fatima Cigarettes are "The Secret of 
Good Batting." Yet he was sure to have 
seen the full-page advertisements for 
Whitlock's bookstore. One, addressed 
to the entering class of 1913, read, 
"Start Right. We Have All The Books 
You 
Need. 
Ask 
Any 
Upperclassman- He'll Direct You To Us. 
Although many Yalies who walk into 
Whitlock's for the first time are usually 
looking for Kinko's Copy Center loca-
ted next door, the bookstore once 
supplied textbooks for approximately 
90Â·percent of Yale's students. In 1900, 
Clifford Whitlock founded the store in 
a small brick building on the site of the 
Skull and Bones tomb. Its limited col-
lection left enough room for him to run 
a bicycle repair business. But by the 
First World War, the store's stock had 
grown to over 100,000 volumes, for-
cing Clifford to close the bicycle shop 
and concentrate on the book trade. 
"Perhaps [the community] found in my 
father some of those things that had 
been recommended in the infant 
colonies, such as the work ethic 'early 
to bed and early to rise."' suggests 
Clifford's son, Reverdy (YC '35). who

has managed the store for over 50 
years. Clifford became popular with 
Yale students and faculty, and he often 
hosted games of chess and checkers 
lasting well into the night. 
When Reverdy took over the store 
in the Thirties, Whitlock's relationship 
with the University had begun to sour. 
Many students buying on credit were 
neglecting to pay their bills. As the 
problem worsened, Reverdy decided 
to stop stocking textbooks. 
He 
eventually broke off his business 
relations with Yale and moved the 
bookstore to its present site in two 
second-floor rooms on Broadway. 
Today, Whitlock's is smaller and .. 
quieter than it once was, specializing 
in antiquarian and used books. "We 
got more casual visitors when we were 
on the first floor," Reverdy says. 
"People aren't likely to come upstairs 
unless they have a genuine interest in 
books." Because many of Whitlock's 
customers are looking for 
rare 
volumes, Reverdy must hunt contin-
ually for additions to his collection. His 
quests often take him to Britain. 
During a 
recent search in Bath, 
Reverdy stumbled upon a 1666 edition 
of the London Almanac. It had belonged 
to the English diaristjohn Evelyn, who 
provided the best contemporary 
account of the Great Fire of London., 
Evelyn had made notes in the margins 
of the Almanac as he walked through 
the burning city. Reverdy bought the 
book for three pounds and later sold it 
to Harvard University, earning him-
