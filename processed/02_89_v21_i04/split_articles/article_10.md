rocking back and forth in a chair by the 
pulpit, his face completely covered;.n 
his hands. Is he crying, you wonder' 
You can't really tell. 


One man after another rises to the 
pulpit. A singing man yields to a 
speaking man who reads from Re\·· 
elations, telling you about the lift 
hereafter, about how "we're not goinf 
to have to live in this city, in all th~ 
trash, forever." You remember the 
piles of beat-up furniture an:! scattered 
garbage you passed on your search fot 
the house. The speaking man yields t• 
a young man with a flabby fnce, fred 
les. and freckle-colored hair. YIJIJ 
recognize him from before the service 
as the visiting pastor who just got the 
calling three years ago at the age of l~ 
The balding man tOld you that th~ 
pastor has come to perform a healin~ 
But for now you have to sit through h~ 
sermon on Faith. which becomes Rtd 
H ot Faith, which becomes Red Ho!


. Burning Faith, 
until 
finally the 
t congregation shouts "Amen!" and 
voices start caJling out. To catch your 
breath, you bury your face and wait. 
Everyone lines up at the front of the 
room. Some stand squared, their arms 
outstretched in a d ivine embrace. 
O thers kneel on the rug in a kowtow of 
prayer. You stay in your chair. 


One of the young women you met 
on the porch earlier, Debbie, notices 
that you're hanging back and ap-
proaches you. She sits beside you and 
starts to tell you how she was raised by 
her grandmother as a church-going 
Catholic. You wonder why she's telling 
you this, and then you remember Ben 
Born Again's four-part plan. Debbie 
must be here to help you: 
(3) BELIEVE that Jesus Christ died for 
you on the cross. "Do you," Debbie asks, 
"accept J esus. Christ as your personal 
savior?" She's looking at you so earn-
estly. You avert your eyes and decide 
to play dumb. You stammer. You act" 
bewildered. Still, she persists, her 
voice full of concern. "Do you believe 
that jesus Christ died for you?" Feeling 
panicked, you say nothing. Maybe, 
you think, you could just skip number 
three and go on to 
(4) RECEIVE, through prayer, Jesus 
Christ into your heart and life. 
You 
examine the mass of swaying backs at 
the front of the room and try to 
imagine yourself up there. Debbie is 
waiting for your answer. Eventually 
she suggests, "You could go up and 
pray, I guess." You hear the doubt in 
her voice and steal a quick look at her 
face, just a glance. Barely, just barely, 
your eyes brush hers. It is enough. "I 
guess ... " she says slowly, shocked by 
the realization, "I guess you can't pray 
if you don't believe." 


He"· face looks crushed, crumpled 
with disappoin_tme11t, the way you 
thought only a child could look. You 
want to apologize, to tell her that really 
you are a believer. You want to explain 
that when "you first met Troy, you 
thought, "Yeah, I can relate." Because 
you, 
too, have rc.ad 
the Gospel 
according to John, and you know that 
the term "Word" derives from the 
Greek logos, meaning both word and 
reason. You even underlined it in a 
book. You want to tell her that you 
grew up sharing her Judeo·Christian 
values and that some of the teach i ng~ 
of the New Testament hold personal 
meaning for you. You want to tell her 
that it's only a matter of time. 
But it's no use. Debbie looks at you, 
and you look back, and neither of you 
can say anything to make the other feel 
any better. And this, you think, is 
really more than you can take. This is
