EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Exclusive membership, a standard 
advantage of any private club, is part 
of the Yale Club package. But the 
club's officers seem to be aware that 
this benefit can create bad impressions. 
The club forbids its administrators 
from granting any interviews, and no 
pictures can be taken inside the 
building. These measures protect the 
club members' privacy, but they also 
conveniently limit 
criticism 
from 
outside. 


By nine o'cloclt on a Wednesday 
evening the lounge is especially quiet. 
Only a few people are still sitting and 
reading; it seems that most of the 
members have already left for home. 
Jack Sobol (BR '53), however, is still 
fmishifig up the day's paper after going 
for his swim. Sobol said that when he 
was an undergraduate, he had only 
vaguely heard of the club and did not 
join until ten years after his gradu-
ation. The current phenomenon of 
students joining the Yale Club directly 
after graduation is fairly modern. 
Although young members may try 
to shape the Yale Club to their own 
lifestyle, they must still meet the club 
half way. Overall, the club is attuned 
to an older way of life. "I could see 
going there and hanging out while 
waiting for a train at Grand Central," 
Schiller said, "but the chances of my 
being at Grand Central in jacket and 
tie are about one in a million." The 
new generation of the Yale Club may 
find the old guard resistant to some of 
their ideas. Only a year-and-a-half 
ago, women were admitted to the 
Turkish bath. But Sobol still takes his 
daily swim. 
"It's an evolutionary 
process, you know. You're always in a 
period of transition."
