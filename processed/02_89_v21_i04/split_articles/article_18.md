"When you see Lloyd 
work with an actor, 
it's very subtle. You 
almost think he isn't 
doing anything."

Avery wants to be a preacher. He's going to 
rent out a room and start up a congregation. 
When he gets his church, Berneice tells him, 
then they can talk about getting married. The 
cast of The Piano Lesson rehearses in a 
cold room in the Yale Afro-American 
Cultural Center. 
Director Lloyd 
Richards, near 70, with a neat, grayish 
beard, sits in his chair wearing a ski 
hat. "What does the church look like?" 
he asks. "Have you seen it? Have you 
been inside? Is it a storefront?" He 
doesn't wait for an answer. "OK , do it 
again." 
Lloyd Richards, dean of the Yale 
School of Drama and artistic director 
of the Yale Repertory Theatre since 
1978, is perhaps the preeminent black 
educator, administrator, and director 
in mainstream American theater. 
Richards is steering The Piano Lesson, 
by August Wilson, along a now fami-
liar path. With Richards as director, 
Wilson's three other plays premiered at 
the Rep, travelled to several regional 
theaters, and opened 
finally on 
Broadway. Piano Lesson is in the middle 
of its journey: After playing at the Rep


last season, it moved to Boston and 
then went up in Chicago, although the 
actors rehearsed in New Haven with 
Richards. 
With Wilson's plays, 
Richards 
has 
found 
the 
national 
acclaim that has eluded him since his 
first Broadway directing credit in 
1959, A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine 
H ansberry. Like Raisin, which was the 
first Broadway play ever to have a 
black director, the Wilson plays make 
stories of African-American 
life 
accessible to both black and white 
audiences. Throughout his career , 
Richards has quietly worked to sound 
black voices on an historically white 
stage. 
"When you see Lloyd work with an 
actor, it's very subtle. You almost 
think he isn't doing anything," says 
Gitta H onegger, the R ep's resident 
dramaturg. who 
frequently directs. 
Because Rtchards grants his actors so 
much freedom , Charles Dutton (ORA 
'83) considers him an actor's director. 
"H e never really tells you what he 
wants," says Dunon, who has played a 
lead role in three of Wilson's plays. 
"You intuitively or instinctively or 
accidentally find it. And then he'll tell 
you you're absolutely right." Richards 
developed this directing style over his 
20 years of teaching at Paul Mann's 
Actor's Workshop, Hunter College, 
and New York University. "Lloyd has 
the patience of Job- more patience 
than any man I've ever met," Dutton 
says. 
Richards sees himself as a play-
wright's director. "I am not interested 
in bending a play to my own purposes. 
I am interested in understanding the 
intent of the playwright to the extent 
that it is possible," he says. Each season 
Richards directs one or two plays at the 
Rep. H e tries to give voice to the 
playwright's intent with every play, 
from Ibsen's A Doll's House to Lee 
Blessing's Cobb, but he prefers plays 
in which he can influence the play-
wright. According to Wilson, Richards 
once called him up to discuss a draft of 
Piano Lesson. He said, "I think you have 
one too many scenes here," Wilson 
says. Reading back over the play, 
Wilson decided that yes, there was an 
expendable section. The next time he 
talked to Richards, Wilson told his friend 
that he had taken out the scene. "Lloyd 
said 'Good,' and to this day I don't 
know if we were talking about the same 
scene." 
As artistic director, R ichards has 
dedicated the R ep to helping new and 
unestablished playwrights. "The play-
wright is at the core of the work of both 
the school and the Rep," he says. "The 
work that he produces is the future of 
the theater. And unless playwrights are 
evolving, what is the future?" In 1981, 
this belief provided the impetus for 
Winterfest, the Rep's annual festival of 
four new plays by young, unknown 
playwrights. 
Richards also chooses the plays for 
the Rep's regular season. H e admits 
that it is a personal decision. "You 
gravitate towards things that reveal or 
express yourself," he says. Richards 
turns to plays that deal directly and 
powerfully with issues of blackness. 
His successes have not been in what he 
calls "redoing other people's 
doings," but in establishing rela-
