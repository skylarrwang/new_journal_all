Six righteous hours of hellfire and britnstone 
on the road to .. the City of Brotherly Love 
.-
preaching at eastern universities like Penn, Princeton, and Yale. The 
routine is more or less the same each time: Set up shop on a busy cam-
pus thoroughfare, straighten the tie and bring out the Bible, then 
launch an epic session of heckling, prostrating, haranguing, con-
demning, and proclaiming. At first, passers-by glance nervously at the 
gray-suited Soldier of God and try to avoid his taunts, bigoted cen-
sures, and hallelujahs. Soon, a crowd gathers around him and the 
spectacle begins. Students, dripping with righteous indignation, con-
front the preacher. They get in his face and yell: denunciations, 
streams of obscenities, insults. At Princeton, Brother Stephen tells 
me, one student, "a Jewish boy," actually hit him. "We're going to 
cake that kid to court," Laurie assures me. 

At Yale, students' responses have ranged from outrage co 
mild amusement. One student walked up to Brother Stephen and 
blew smoke in his eyes. Two female friends of mine talked about 
standing in front of him and licking each ochers' faces. Most Yalies 
stop to watch for a bit, then move on, casually mentioning the 
"freak on Wall Street" or the "crazy Christian guy" in the dining hall 
or before class. I wonder if Brother Stephen knows chat his shoucing 
and jumping and frantic arm-waving is co most of us merely a freak 
show, and chat his devotion and faith are just further evidence of his 
insanity, something to be laughed about and mocked, then forgotten. I 
don't want to tell him, as ifl have some reason to protect him and his feel-
togs. 

So we talk about the righteous objectors, the students who confront him 
and argue with him. Brother Stephen's act is meant to be interactive--he mocks, 
he jeers, he accuses listeners of sin and informs them that they will "spend eter-
nity in a lake of fire," and he expects them to talk back. That is why, Laurie tells 
me, Stephen likes to preach at Ivy League schools: Here students argue with 
him. They talk philosophy and theology and sociology and politics and the 
Bible, even if discussion is not always civil. At some schools, UConn for exam-
ple, students just walk by and tell him to fuck off, not even taking the cime 
to stop and watch the show. 

No one is more outraged by Brother Stephen than the handful of 
devout Christians on campus. To them, his Christianity is an egregious 
perversion of their religion and their Bible. I have trouble ascertaining just 
what kind of Christian Brother Stephen is--according to him, there is 
only one kind, and his kind is it. "All those ChristiAns at Yak,,. he cells 
me, "aren't really Christians. If you are a true Christian, you devore your-
self co spreading the word of the Bible and helping people realize Jesus 
as the son of God." Those Christians at Yale have, for the most part, 
been fierce and vocal in their opposition to him. But, Brother Stephen 
tells me, this opposition does not reflect the feelings of the true 
Christians at the University. '"I ask Christians if they chink homosexuals 
att going to hell," he elaborates, "and they say yes. But they whisper-

they're afraid to shout it out. I'm here to 
make Christians know that they can shout 
out their beliefs and their faith in Jesus 
Christ!" 

I TELL BROTHER STEPHEN that I am a 
writer, and ask whether I can write about 
the trip. His reply is an unequivocal, 
"Absolutely." Brother Stephen, it seems, 
loves publicity. He brags about frequent 
articles in the Daily Pennsylvanian and the 
Princetonian, and claims that he was men-
tioned in the New York Times in an article 
about evangelical preachers disrupting 
Republican 
convention-goers 
in 
Philadelphia this summer. On the dash-
board, there is a stack of copies (presum-
ably to hand out back home) of the 
October 12 Yale Daily News, the front page 
of which is dominated by a picture of 
Stephen, looking wild-eyed and possessed 
with a Bible in hand, and the headline 
"Zealot preaches to Yale masses." Still, he is 
not happy about the paper's coverage. "The 
Yale Daily News printed nasty info about 
me and the Gospel of Jesus Christ," he 
calmly explains. "One Yale student actually 
said 'I have not been to Sunday school in 10 
years and I know the Bible better than 
Brother Stephen.' Of course, this freshman 
wouldn't dare humiliate himself by making 
himself known to me." 

By the time we get on 1-95 and head 
towards New York City, Stephen, Jeff, and 
Laurie are discussing the day. They sound 
like high school athletes on their way home 
from a big victory, recounting the events 
play by play. "Remember when that one 
kid came up and argued with me about 
Romans?" Stephen asks us, grinning, victo-
rious. "Yeah, you told him," Brother Jeff 
shoots back, and they all shake their heads 
and smile. It occurs ro me that Brother 
Stephen, Brother Jeff, and Laurie do not 
see even a hint of validity in the various 
arguments-Biblical, philosophical, socio-
logical, political-brought against them by 
the academic elite of America. Every anec-
dote they mention ends with the same con~ 
tented smile and sense of victory; to them, 
their logic is impeccable. 

At Yale there was an almost endless 
stream of cock-sure kids marching up to 
Brother Stephen and declaring their own 
grain of incontrovertible evidence or unde-
niable reasoning that would prove, without 
a doubt, that he is wrong. Yet his beliefs 
have not changed, nor has he been con-
verted to the truth through some flawlessly 
argued philosophy or a student's assertion 
that "God is love." "People come up to hjm 
and they think that they can change his 
mind," Laurie says, "but he hears the same 
arguments everywhere, and if they didn't 
work the first time, they're not going to 
work now." 

After all this talk of preaching, I'm 
curious: How many converts has Brother 
Stephen won in the past 18 years? For his 
entire adult life, he has spent nearly every 
day either studying the Bible or spreading 
the Gospel at a mall or baseball game or on 
a college campus. He often preaches for ten 
or twelve hours at a time, shaking his fist 
and shouting and waving his Bible at all 
who care to listen and many who don't. His 
answer surprises me: "I've never actually 
saved someone." But he does not seem 
bothered in the least, presumably because 
of his faith. To his mind, every true 
Christian is driven to preach this same 
message of the Gospel-otherwise, you 
would not be a true Christian, he asserts, 
just like the silent ones at Yale. Laurie 
chimes in, supporting her husband: "You 
have to take a radical stand for righteous-
ness. " 

BY THE TIME WE GET ON 1-295 to 
Philadelphia, Philip is asleep and Brother 
Stephen and Brother Jeff are in the front, 
unabashedly belting out the lyrics of the 
acoustic evangelical music on the stereo. 
The words have something to do with 
Jesus being there for you when your belief 
is threatened by the cold and hard world, 
but I stopped paying attention after the 
first few songs, all of which sounded the 
same to my ear. I am in the back with 
Laurie, her youngest son asleep in her 
arms. "You know," she begins, eyeing me, 
"I used to be a sinner." I nod and look 
away. The silence is easier. 

But she goes on, unprompted. "I used 
to sin. I fornicated. I would, like, go co 
parties. I cursed all the time, it was always, 
like, 'F' this and 'F' that." She grew up in 
New Jersey in a non-religious family and 
went to college jaded and indulgent. I try 
to imagine her as a college student, some-
one I would see drinking keg-beer at a 
party or huddled, smoking a joint, laugh-
ing on a dark quadrangle. She is looking at 
me earnestly. I ask her when she changed, 
when she was "saved," and, more impor-
tantly, how. Her answer is matter-of-fact. 
When she was a sophomore .at West 

Chester University, she "just didn't like 
going to parties anymore." I press her for 
an explanation. "I didn't curse, I didn't 
drink, I just didn't want to go out for, like, 
a few weekends in a row." And? "It was a 
sign from God." 

Laurie joined a campus crusade, grad-
ually gave up her old sinning friends, and 
"devoted her life to Christ." She met':'-
Stephen rwo years later, at a college min-
istry retreat. They continued running into 
each other over the next several years. In 
1997, Stephen "thought about all the men 
of God who had great wives" and decided 
to pray for one. Lo and behold, he soon 
unexpectedly bumped into Laurie and 
wondered if "this could be the Lord." After 
subjecting her to a strict set of criteria (for 
example, "she had to want to have many 
children" and ''be a good cook and like car-
ing for the home"), he approached her 
father to ask for his daughter's hand in 
marriage. 

What surprises me more than any-
thing is that Laurie is not the meek, 
unopinionated, old-fashioned wife I 
expected her to be. At one point earlier in 
the day, as I watched Brother Stephen, a 
female friend approached me, pointed at 
Laurie, and whispered, "God, I wonder 
what the wife is thinking." Indeed, the 
scene did seem easy enough to pigeonhole: 
the Good Christian, an old-fashioned 
chauvinist, and his subservient wife who 
smiles approvingly and minds the children. 
But unless Brother Stephen and his wife's 
interaction in the car ride is an elaborate 
charade for my benefit, this prejudice is far 
from true. 


Laurie is girlish-looking, with a few 
lingering freckles and mousy brown hair 
pulled back in a ponytail, and she wears a 
simple brown dress with a white turtleneck 
underneath. While her husband drives, 
singing along to his favorite evangelical 
rock tape, we talk politics and the history 
of the evangelical movement and child-
rearing. Laurie is a social worker in the 
poor, rundown area of West Philadelphia 
where they live. "Some of the higher-up 
people in [the company where I work] are 
homosexuals," she tells me, as if searching 
for approval by demonstrating her capacity 
for tolerance. Yet she also explains the 
ongoing homosexual plot to inftltrate the 
public school system, a fact affirmed by "a 
mass of evidence" that she refrains from 
explaining. Her kids, of course, will be 
home-schooled. 

The presence of the kids has made me 
uncomfortable since the ride began. Before 
he fell asleep, Philip taught me the "B-I-B-
L-E" song and we read the story of Noah's 
Ark (he also quoted Bible passages to me 
while his parents coached him). Earlier in 
the ride, Laurie slapped him for hitting his 
brother. Noticing my gaze, she explained, 
"You have to show them pain when they do 
something wrong." 

THE PHILADELPHIA NIGHT is clear and crisp 
and at midnight we pull up to a large house 
near the Penn campus with Greek letters 
above the door. Heavy bass can be heard 
from inside, and, occasionally, a group of 
students goes in or out. My friend the frat 
boy stands outside, beer in hand, the stu-
pefied smile of drunkenness plastered on 
his face. I squirm uncomfortably-! am 
loath to let Brother Stephen, Brother Jeff, 
and Laurie see the world I'll enter (or, more 
accurately, reenter} after I leave the car. 

Brother Stephen turns around in his 
seat to face me. He is smiling, his blue eyes 
friendly. I thank them, trying to be profuse 
while still rushing to escape this awkward 
state of limbo. But, as I express my grati-
tude, Brother Stephen interrupts me: "No, 
thank you. Thank you and your people for 
the Holy Bible. Thank you for spending 
these hours with us." He gives me a pam-
phlet. "Take this," he tells me and I look 
down at the paper. "Soldiers of Christ" is 
printed boldly across the top. I pretend to 
study it, nod, and start to get out of the car. 
Brother Stephen stops me. "Brother 
Daniel," he addresses me. His voice drips 
with earnestness; his gaze is magnetic. 
"Atont'with me, Brother Daniel. You could 
die at any moment, and you wi/J go to hell. 
I don't want that, Brother Daniel!" He goes 
on. I don't move. Can all of this really be 
honest, genuine care for all of the sinners 
like me whom be believes will spend an 
eternity burning in hell? At the moment, I 
feel like it is. But, I guess that's exactly what 
Brother Stephen wants me to feel. "Pray 
with me, praise the Lord! Atone with 
me .... " With Brother Stephen's words still 
ringing in my head, I step out of the car 
and head for the keg.
