ust as every high school student in America 
knows a Tracy Flick, the painfully overachieving 
protagonist from Tom Perrotta's novel Election, every 
Yalie knows a Kristin Willard. She is the "prep school 
girl from Greenwich, a long-limbed beauty with an 
overactive social conscience" who works in the 
Branford Dining Hall with Danny, the working-class 
hero of Perrotta's latest book, joe College. Kristin 
Willard is the first of many eerily familiar characters 
that Perrotta, himself a Yale graduate and English 
instructor at Har¥ard, offers throughout the novel. 
Despite certain fajlings, Perrotta pulls off the best fic-
tional rendering of modern Yale in recent memory. 
The novel begins and ends in a few tumultuous 
weeks during the spring semester of 1982. Danny, a 
feckless junior English major, passes his days trudging 
through Middlnnarch and complaining bitterly about 
his reading even though he doesn't mean a word of it. 
Like his fellow Yale weenies, he is dumbfounded by 
the centrality of singing groups to campus life and 
constantly questions the veracity of rumors about the 
sex everyone is having in CCL. At Naples, he "jockeys 
for position among the mob of ex-National Merit 
Scholars and former student council presidents" who 
wave "plastic plates in the air like extras in a movie 
about the Depression." 
Though Danny is comfortable in the bi2arre uni-
verse that is Yale-where Whlffenpoofs spontaneous-
ly break into song in stairwells and where be is sur-
rounded by the likes of classmate Jodie Foster-he is 
torn between his collegiate home and his working-
class roots in an Icalian New Jersey neighborhood. At 
Yale, he "plays up the working-class angle," which his 
wealthier friends find "vaguely exotic." He tells chival-
rous tales of his exploits aboard the Roach Coach (so 
named because of the grinning cockroach on the pas-
senger door), the lunch truck his father operates at 
various office parking lots and construction sites 
throughout the Garden State. 


At the same time, though, he downplays his rela-
tionship with Cindy, the secretary with whom he had 
a more-than-a-fling the previous summer. He prefers 
to cavort around campus with Polly, a fel-
low writer for Reality, the campus literary 
magazine "devoted to everything but col-
lege, [a magazine] that focused on 
exploited workers, violent crime, urban 
poverty, and moral squalor." The cover of the first issue 
features a picture of a dog defecating, and the magnine 
refuses to accommodate any "sonnets about menstrua-
tion" or "wacky stories about summer jobs." Despite his 
best efforts, Danny's affection for Polly goes mostly unre-
quited: She is engaged in a torrid, dramatic, on-again-off-
again relationship with Peter Preston, a young professor in 
the English department. · 
Danny's relationships with Cindy and Polly highlight 
the tension between the two worlds in which our hero 
lives. At school, Danny's women of choice "favored baggy 
sweaters and objected to makeup on political grounds." 
Cindy, though, "chewed Juicy Fruit, painted her nails, 
and didn't skimp on the eyeshadow." Her appeal, there-
fore, is less as a girlfriend than "as a potential anecdote, a 
puzzling and amusing srory I would share with my room-
mates in one of those hilarious late-night conversations 
that I missed so much when I was away from college." 
Danny is honest with himself and wjch the reader, but 
rarely, if ever, with the people who surround him. 
The greatest strength of the novel is Danny's relent-
less candor, his searing introspection and self-criticism. 
Perrotta has a real gift for capturing the idiosyncratic Yale 
undergraduate experience in all its glorious self-discovery 
and self-loathing. He understands the strange interper-
sonal dynamics of late bloomers who must prove their 
mettle by saying things like, "You ever try to read George 
Eliot stoned?" And he understands how the largest steps 
toward maturity and autonomy are ofren taken on the 
least dangerous roads. For example, after months of 
mockery and pressure from his Korean roommate Sang, 
Danny finally decides to taste kimchi, the spicy Korean 
cabbage delicacy. With all the bravado of a knight about 
to go into battle, Danny downs a tiny piece of the briny 
cabbage. All in his presence approvingly proclaim that he 
has lost his "kimchi virginity." 
As Danny matures, his acts of bravery increase in 
their intensity. When he returns home for spring break, he 
must once again take the helm of the Roach Coach 
because 
his 
father 
is

OUR TIME 
"t· 
bedridden, recovering from a long-overdue 
hemorrhoid operation. A family of bul-
lies--the Lunch Monsters, led by Vito 
Meatballs--has invaded the town and 
intends to take over Danny's and all the 
other lunch truck operators' businesses. 
When one of Vito's henchmen stops 
Danny at a traffic light and tells him not to 
show up for work dte next day, Danny 
promptly tells him to "fuck off." At the 
warehouse where all the truck operators 
pick up their provisions for the day, Fat 
Teddy and Pete the Polack, men three 
times Danny's age, inform him that "he's 
got balls." 
But dlls bravado does not easily trans-
late into the emotional bravery he needs to 
deal successfully with either of his love 
interests. Perrotta does a solid job of 
exploring the intricacies of Danny's double 
life, in which small successes are coupled 
with much greater setbacks. As things 
begin to improve with Polly, Cindy 
announces that she is pregnant with 
Danny's child, and Danny effectively loses 
both women. Individual crises do not 
destroy Danny, but each teaches him a 
small lesson that contributes to his discov-
ery of who he is, what he wants, and how 
be fits into one or both of the worlds he 
inhabits. 
As Danny makes his journey from 
inexperienced 2.o-year old to seasoned 2.o-
year old, it is dte people around him who 
motivate, enable, and demand the transi-
tion. In order to ensure that me transition 
is believable, Perrotta treats everyone fairly, 
from Lorelei, dte hapless New Haven high 
school student who works widt Danny in 
the dining hall, to Matt, the son of a GM 
executive who tells everyone his father is a 
car salesman. Throughout the novel 
Perrotta also sprinkles characters familiar 
co anyone who has spent some time at 
Yale: the American Studies graduate stu-
dan willing to advise Danny's friend on an 
independent srudy of presidential assassins

and their pop culture appeal, the neighbor 
who invites friends over to parry on his 
"conceptual patio," and the conservative 
Yak Daily NL"Wscolumnist who laments the 
loss of tradition at fair olde Yale. 
foe Colkge, however, is far from per-
fect. Perrotta does not always avoid facile 
characterization, and several characters are 
flat and barely believable. Cindy's mother is 
almost too perfectly pitiful as the ex-strip-
per, ex-junky schizophrenic, and Nick is 
dte always-cursing, belligerent-dining-hall-
worker everyman. Without the least bit of 
irony, Perrotta envisions a sort of class 
utopia where left-leaning, bourgeois Yalies 
and real live working-class folks get along 
and might even learn a little bit from each 
oilier. In addition, the turns and endings of 
many plot lines are absurdly simple and 
convenient. The appearance of an erstwhile 
boyfriend itching to be a father solves 
Cindy's pregnancy problem and an inci-
dent of plagiarism is nearly covered up. 
Despite its faults, Joe Colkge is a 
tremendously readable book. Danny's 
humor and candor make him a fantastic 
narrator while his teen angst makes him a 
believable and sympathetic hero. For those 
who want to read about the trials of an 
intelligent and nobly lost protagonist, the 
book is entertaining, albeit simplistic. But 
for Yale readers who have a prurient inter-
est in seeing their alma mater in print, the 
book's weaknesses are far less important 
dtan the accuracy of most of Perrotta's 
descriptions; foe College is a captivating 
portrait of life on this side of Phelps Gate.
