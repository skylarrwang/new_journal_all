l~e arc~ives of Israel's ~est -~nown writer ~ave travele~ far to rest at Yale. 
W 
hen I was five years old, a poet came to my house and sat 
at my kitchen table. I couldn't pronounce his name, but I 
could see the respect my parents, both writing professors, had for 
him. He had a heavy-browed, gray-haired head and a gentle, 
accented voice, and he laughed with my father about passing the 
town of Pepsi-Cola (Pensacola, Florida) on the plane: "There must 
be a whole state of Coca-Cola," he said. When I was 16, we met 
again in his home city of Jerusalem. He read his poetry co a group 
of American teenagers in both Hebrew and English, and talked 
about the dream of peace. "Here is a man who has really figured out 
a way to live," I wrote in my journal that day. 
On September 22, 2000, the poet passed away. Yehuda 
Amichai, whose career spanned half a cenrury, was the quintessen-
tial writer of Israel and Jerusalem. So how did his archives end up 
here in the u.s., ar the Beinecke Libraty? The answer illuminates a 
tension that ran through the poet's entire life. 
Yehuda Amichai chose his own name, which means "My 
People Live." Born in Germany in 1924, he immigrated to Israel 
with his family in 1936. He was one of the few poets of his genera-
tion to attend a religious school, and although he was a lifetime 
agnostic, biblical and liturgical language flowed through his poetry. 
Benjamin Harshav, Yale's Blaustein Professor of Hebrew Language 
and Literature, first met Amichai during Israel's War of 
Independence in 1948 in the Negev, Israel's southern desert, when 
his brigade was relieving Amichai's. Amichai, four years older, was 
already a seasoned soldier, having served during World War 11 in 
Britain's Jewish Brigade. 
After the War of Independence and the establishment of the 
State of Israel, Harshav and his friends at Hebrew University Start-
ed a small literaty journal. Lilrrat (Toward) published "probably 
Arnichai's first poems," Harshav says. According to Harshav, it was 
a period of intellectual and social upheaval. "It was a very political 
time, the last days of Stalin," he says. "The whole country was on 
tuna (restraint). Very stricr rations; I mean, you got one egg a week. 
In 1951 suddenly there was a feeling of detaching from the ideology.

We called it 'Putting Zionism in quotation marks.' Socialism, too. 
We were tired of ideology, phraseology. 'Don't talk Zionism to me' 
meant don't talk abstracmess, philosophy." Arnichai's poetty fit 
right into this mood, with its insistence on the simple and the con-
crete. One early poem reads, in its entirety: 
Rain fills on the faces of my friends. 
My living friends, who 
Cover their heads with blankers 
And my dead friends, who 
Don't. 
These five short lines contain the essence of Amichai's poetry: emo-
tion conveyed obliquely, through an instantly recognizable image. 
Amichai studied literarure at Hebrew University and then 
taught primary and secondary school for a rime. His first book of 
poems, published in 1955, was called Now and in Other Times. 
"That was so revolutionary in Israel, where the past was every-
thing," says Harshav. "And suddenly he says 'Now.' What do you 
feel now? What do you experience now, personally? Love, making 
love. I would say Amichai was born in 1955 with this first book of 
poems. It was then that he became Amichai and he never went 
back." In Israel, Amichai was sometimes accused of "insufficient 
Zionism." But Arnichai never ignored politics, he simply drew a 
stronger line than most between the poetic and the political. "He 
wrote about peace and love," said Barbara Harshav, a lecrurer in 
Yale's Comparative Literature Department who, with her husband, 
translated much of Amichai's poetry into English, "[This,) in a 
country of war and hate, is a political statement." Amichai's poetry 
was also a statement about the future of the Hebrew language. 
"Amichai was accused of not knowing Hebrew," Benjamin Harshav 
said, because his language was so stripped down and focused on the 
entities of the modem world: helicopters, oil rigs, tanks. "His real 
achievement was putting the language of the everyday into Hebrew 
poetry," Barbara Harshav said. 
After initial critical reaction, Israel responded positively, raising 
Amichai to the starus of a national treasure over his career of five
