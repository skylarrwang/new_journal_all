a reel of the movie and shipped it to Honolulu, and ... what? Peter 
has quit mid-sentence, wallcing upstairs to his office in silence. 
Afraid he has forgotten to finish the ~ory, I ask, "How did it 
do?" 


Peter opens his office door co reveal the original promotional 
poster for Ecstmy. There are some words along the edges, but the 
poster is dominated by a large, simple sketch of a woman leaning 
back against a rock. She is beautiful, smiling, and naked. 
"They broke the theater doors down," he says. Lenny's cut 
from the theater owner would be the seed money for the Lincoln 
Theatre in New Haven. 


Lenny and Robert ran the Lincoln successfully until 1966, 
when the city informed them that their theater was in the way of an 
exit ramp-to-be off Interstate 91, and put the Theatre on 30-day

Showcase. These exclusive runs draw moviegoers from New Haven 
co "New Haven," and can extend for several months or longer. 
Ammcan B~auty. for example, never came to our New Haven. 


"Before the movie opened, we knew this would be a big one, 
maybe the big one," Spodick says of Ammcan &auty, the 1999 
Dream Works blockbuster that grossed over $130 million nation-
wide. "It was one of those crossover picrures that was artistically sig-
nificant and did tremendous business." The film opened at one of 
the "New Haven" Showcase locations in the suburbs, Spodick says, 
and played £here for nine months, switching between locations and 
even leaving the Showcase altogether for a while, during which 
Spodick still was not allowed to play the film. Spodick repeatedly 
requested the film from Dream Works but was refused on the 
grounds of the exclusive-run contract. Spodick believed so strongly 
destruction notice. Building maintenance was 
tough to justify when the only certainty in the 
building's future was destruction. The Lincoln 
spent the next 16 years a month's notice from 
death, finally closing in 1982. But Lenny and 
Robert still had the York Square Cinema, 
opened in 1970 at 6 1 Broadway. 


Unless its owners 
work a miracle,

contacted Dream Works with an offer afrer the 
film had come out on video, nearly a year afrer 
the national release. Again the studio refused. 


This is not the only movie the York Square has 
missed, and Dream Works is not the only stu-
dio that has seemingly blacklisted the city of 
New Haven. Eleven others have all decided to 
play only in the suburbs despite evidence that 
the York Square can be very profitable wben 
allowed to play mainstream films, raising the 
question that tortures Spodick: Why?

Haven, population 130,000. Jackpot. Or so it would seem. Unless 
Peter Spodick works a miracle, the York Square could be out of 
bwiness by Christmas. 


BusiNESS HAS BUN BAD in recent years because major studios have 
been increasingly unwilling to allow their films to play at the only 
theater in New Haven. It's hard to say what's more absurd: that stu-
dios collectively boycott medium-sized cities with large captive 
audiences, or that Peter Spodick has decided to sue them all for it. 


Spodick filed Broadway Theatre Corporation v. Buma Vista 
Piaures, a al on April 19, 2000, citing the studios' refusal to license 
films in New Haven as a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade 
Pncrices Act (CUTPA). "[CUTPA] is a consumer protection act," 
Spodick says. "The defmition in the law is unfairness to consumers. 
How is it that some people get a little more f.Urness than others?" 


He wants a court order to prevent the studios from denying movies 
to New Haven. Spodick's claim hinges on geography: The accused 
distributors all agree on the boundaries of a territory they call "New 
Haven" that is considerably larger than the real New Haven. 


Sa.d.ios have divided the nation into thousands of territories, and 
their "New Haven" combines the city of New Haven with more 
chan a dozen surrounding towns. In addition to the York Square, 
lbc studios' "New Haven" is home to four multiplexes, all owned by 
Sbowase Cinemas, a national chain. Since its first "New Haven" 
location opened in 1967, Showcase has licensed films from distrib-
ucon under an •exclusive run" agreement, meaning that no other

At the trial next year, the studios' response will probably 
amount co "Why what?" Studios profit directly from the success of 
their films, as theater owners must pay a fraction of each movie's 
ticket sales back co the studio. This fraction varies--studios tend to 
demand more return for films they expect to succeed, and especial-
ly in the film's opening weeks, when attendance is likely to be high-
esc. The fraction shrinks as the film's run continues, but can begin 
quite large, sometimes as high as 70 percent. Because the studios' 
income is so dependent on ticket sales, they are generally free to 
license films co whomever they choose. 


UNTIL R£CENTLY, AMERICA'S LARGEST FILM EXHIBITORS have been 
engaged in a furious building war. The result is 33 percent more 
screens than five years ago, and, for six major exhibitors, bankrupt-
cy. Industry analyses say that the nation's 39,000 screens are about 
12,000 too many. "Overscreening" has complicated the movie exhi-
bition business, especially the relationship between national chains 
like Carmike Cinemas (the country's third largest exhibitor) and 
small movie houses like the York Square. The building spree con-
tributed most to overscreening, but smaller, older theaters will most 
likely bear the cost of their competitors' mistake. Multiplexes, after 
all, have a lot to offer: digital sound, stadium searing, and conces--
sion stands of occasionally intimidating selection (go ro the 
Manhattan AMC 25 for chicken quesadillas, the Plainville, cr, 2o-
plex for popcorn shrimp). O lder theaters' worn-out chairs and gar-
bled sound may appeal to nostalgia, but not ro Hollywood. When 
13 


a new multiplex springs up near a mall and 
demands exclusive runs, what are the stu-
dios to do? Every town, it seems, now has 
an abandoned theater on Main Street and a 
multiplex ten miles away. The villain, 
Spodick explains, is not just one theater 
chain, 
but 
a 
juggernaut: 
National 
Amusements, a sprawling 
entity 
that 
contains 
Viacom, cas, Paramount, 
United International, and 
Showcase 
Cinemas. 


National Amusements has 
been captained almost sin-
glehandedly in the last 
dozen years by a man 
named Sumner Redstone. 


Redstone's 
Cinemas 
controls 
more 
than 1350 screens across the 
eastern half of the country, 
with high concentrations in 
Massachusetts and southern 
Connecticut. He has New 
Haven surrounded: to the southeast, eight 
screens in Orange; to the southwest, nine 
in Milford; to the north, twelve in North 
Haven. Redstone has constructed a ring 
approximately eight miles in radius around 
New Haven, drawing to the perimeter cus-
tomers with personal transportation but 
neglecting everyone else; as Spodick often 
points out, "There is no bus." 


And if this ring continues its "squeeze" 
on New Haven, Spodick says, there will be 
no movie theater here either. Spodick 
knows Redstone and his strategies, and 
fears they wiU work as well in New Haven 
as they did in Hamden, whose local theater 
found itself unable to get first-run films. 
Showcase had screens in North Haven, and 
was not interested in neighbors. Showcase 
applied the "squeeze," and when the 
Hamden theater folded, Showcase bought 
their lease. T he theater later reopened 
under Showcase management. Then, "a 
few years later Schowcase opens an eight-
screener in North Haven, and they close 
the theater in Hamden. It gets convened 
into a giant Blockbuster Video. The city of 
Hamden, population 50,000 is officially 
shit out of luck. There will never be the-
aters there. That's how it works," Spodick 
says. "Fold 'em, take 'em over. Fold 'em, 
take 'em over. If Showcase doesn't do it, 
some competitor may go in there and make 
trouble for them, so they take it over." 


Showcase does not build in the sub-
urbs by accident, Spodick says. "They 
know when 
build these multimillion 
doUar complexes who's going to come to 
the movies. New Haven has 20,000 people 
living on welf.ue. Showcase doesn't want 
these people." Spodick cites overscreening 
as one reason why Showcase "cannot allow 
downtown theaters access to first-run 
films," lest the York Square's central loca-
tion begin drawing New Haven residents 
who usually venture to the suburbs for new 
movies. The suburbs are out of reach, how-
ever, for the poor and those without cars, 
most of whom will not pay a $25 cab fare 
on top of an $8.25 ticket for a first-run 
movie in North Haven, the nearest 
Showcase location. 


"People who live in New Haven have 
been disenfranchised," Spodick says--to 
him movies are an urban dweller's basic 
right. "It's not a matter of money; it's about 
the quality of our shared urban lives. There 
is no successful downtown anywhere that 
does not have first-run movies. We have 
everything else. This is an industry that 
brings people out at night on a mass basis. 
Movies are an urgent catalyst for restau-
rants, downtown shopping. bookstores that 
stay open late, coffee shops that are open all 
night to accommodate people on the 
town." 


As proof that crowds would foUow if 
first-run movies were to come, Spodick 
offers the example of Th~ Blair Wit'h 
Project, a horror film that cost $30,000 to 
make and grossed $140 million. Its success 
surprised just about everyone, including 
Redstone, who did not demand an exclu-
sive run and let the York Square 
have it. With Yale empty for 
the summer, Blair Witch still 
grossed $6,000 on opening day 
and $27,000 for the week, and, 
according to Spodick, out-
grossed most area theaters. 


Nevertheless, when a sequel 
was announced, the studio told 
Spodick it would never play in 
New Haven. "New Haveners 
responded to Blair Witch, 
proved it could make a fortune 
downtown. 
That's 
why 
[Redstone] will not allow us to 
play it anymore." 


Since the York Square 
opened, perhaps no movie has belonged 
there as much as last year's The Situ/is, set at 
Yale. The Hartford Courant advised resi-
dents to come here just to watch it: "Those 
wanting to enjoy Th~ Situ/is to the fullest 
should journey ... to the theater closest to 
the campus of Yale University in order to 
rune in to the chorus of jeers and cheers 
from the sons of Eli." Redstone let the York 
Square have Th~ Skulls, but only because 
good business sense told him he had to. 
What better way to pique national atten-
tion than to prevent a movie about Yale 
&om playing at the only theater on cam-
pus? 


Redstone 
convinced 
Universal 
Pictures to play it in the suburbs first for a 
few weeks anyway, then tossed it to the 
York Square just as school was ending. "We 
would have turned out the biggest gross in 
the United States for that movie," Spodick 
says wistfully. 


THE TWELVE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS named 
in the suit all have the same lawyer. His 
office, it turns out, is a half mile from the 
York Square on the New Haven Green. He 
and Spodick have known each other since 
they were kids: They went to Amity Junior 
High School together. 


THE NEw JouRNAL 


Richard Bowerman works for Tyler 
Cooper & Alcorn, one of the city's top law 
firms. He represents--the studios, the out-
of-towners who in this fiercely local fight 
are perhaps too easily condemned simpTy 
because they are so big. They may even be 
ruthless and greedy, but does this distin-
guish them from other large corporations, 
much less make their actions illegal? 


Bowerman is resolute: It is not unlawful for 
the studios to license their films, which are 
copyrighted products, as they wish. The 
studios "have a right to license them in any 
w.&y they deem proper, same as you would 
if you made a motion picture or wrote a 
book." 


This challenge to the uniqueness of 
Spodick's claim can be expanded. The York 
Square's predicament reflects the wide-
spread phenomenon of businesses' flight to 
the suburbs. Is it so awful that they might 
now see their movies there as well? 


Yes, Spodick argues, because not 
everyone can get to the suburbs. There is 
bus service to the Showcase-managed 
Fourplex in Milford, but the round trip 
totals 21 miles, a distance described by 
Spodick in his legal complaint as "prohibi-
tive." Nobody wants to ride on the bus for 
an hour to see a movie, but first-run movies 
being available by public transportation 
further blurs a complaint that already 
hinges on a jury's interpretation of what 
·wr" is. 


"The York Square does not have the 
grossing potential of other houses in the 
area," Bowerman says. When, at his father's 
request, Peter Spodick became manager of 
the theater, he replaced Arnold Gorlick, 
who had managed the theater for 2.4 years 
and moved to the new Madison Art 
Cinemas in Madison, cr, 20 minutes from 
New Haven. Interestingly, Gorlick's new 
theater does better than the York Square. 
The Madison quickly became one of the 
Rate's leading art theaters, playing a variety 
of films and, according to Gorlick, existing 
in harmony-even cooperation-with 
Showcase. Spodick brisdes at the notion 
that the Madison could even be called an 
an theater, and he has a point: Most art 
houses don't have eight channels of Dolby 
Ia surround sound :md sufficiendy elegant
