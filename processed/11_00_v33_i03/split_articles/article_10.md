Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
WHEN YALE ATHLBTIC TEAMS bring .rKruits 
to campus throughout the year, they invari-
ably end up showing them, in the words of 
one athlete, "a good time." Exactly what 
that means varies from team to team, but if 
the arrest of a crew .rKruit for alcohol pos-
session at a frat party in September is any 
indication, it generally involves some form 
of debauchery. Beyond this, the uninitiated~ 
can only guess, and so must relegate any 
further inquiry to movies like Porky's or 
PCU. The men's lacrosse team, a Yale Hx-
ture since the late nineteenth century, is no 
exception to this tradition, with one subtle 
revision. The coaches make it exceedingly 
dear to their recruits that, should they 
matriculate at Yale, they stand a pretty 
good chance of living the good life well 
beyond their college years. 

Before all men's lacrosse recruits apply 
to Yale, the coaching staff sends them a 
glossy folder packed with assorted papers. 
The bulging left pocket of the folder con-
sists solely of photocopied Blue Book 
course information, but in the right pock-
et, tucked behind boring documentS out-
lining the basics of a Yale education, lie the 
secrets to success that should send every 
lacrosse recruit on a fast-break to riches. 

Recruits Hrst see three pages listing 
nearly all of Yale's illustrious alumni-this 
could be you, recruits!--cuegorized neatly 
into "politics," "entertainers and media,~ 
and "business leaders." Among those men-
tioned are actor "Vincint" Price, former 
Secretary of Defense Dick "Chaney" (who 
apparently picked up a degree from Yale 
while no one was looking), former 
Pennsylvania Senator "Arron Spector," and 
wordsmith Noah Webster, who, in a da2-
zling and mostly unknown feat, graduated 
in 1978--cryogenically, we're to assume. 

Next, after anoth~!r lengthy list of fac-
ulty and alumni Nobel Prize winners (a 
lucrative honor-prize winners receive 
around $1,ooo,ooo), recruitS Hnd a page 
entitled 
"Ivy 
League 
Millionaires." 
Compiled by the Taft Group, a self-pro-
claimed "publisher of reference works on 
the philanthropic activities of wealthy indi-
viduals," this list ranks each Ivy League 
school according to irs success in churning 
out millionaires. Yale, not surprisingly, 
ranks number one, having produced 3,249 
millionaire graduates, with rivals Harvard 
(2,789), Brown (869), and an especially sus-
pect Princeton (a paltry 190) trailing 
behind. 

And if recruitS haven't yet begun to 
salivate at their assured ascent to the ranks 
of aristocracy, there's more. The next sheet 
carries the title, "Where the CEo's Went to 
College," subtitled, "A Fortune survey of 
the nation's top bosses shows that Ivies and 
Big Ten schools rank high." According to a 
"recent study" (1990) by Fortune maga2ine, 
not only do 156 of Fortune 500 company 
CEOs come from the Ivy League, but a 
whopping 43 hail from Yale-that's nearly 
ten percent! "If you want to become the 
chief executive officer of a Fortune 500 
company," Fortune asks, "where should you 
go to school?" The answer is Yale, of 
course, whose domination of the Fortune 
500 putS it atop yet another list, leaving 
Princeton (32), Harvard (25), and a dozen 
other universities dawdling miserably 

For any lacrosse recruit still uncon-
vinced that Yale is a one-way ticket to the 
top, the coaches furnish one Hnal ranking 
that outdoes them all-the "Power Factor." 
As part of itS cro survey, Fortune took the 
average graduating class from Yale in the 
1950s, did some fuzzy math, and came up 
with a number meant to "gauge which col-
leges have been most successful on a per 
capita basis at schooling future chiefs." In 
other words, 
Forttm~ reduced potential 
power to a single number. Yale, with a pow-
erfully staggering Power Factor of 4.87, 
once again takes the top spot, followed by 
familiar runners-up Princeton (4.66), 
Harvard (2.26), and Dartmouth (1.98) . 

But do men's lacrosse recruits really 
buy any of this? Do they studiously com-
pare Power Factors and millionaire rank-
ings in deciding which college to attend? 
And did Dick "Chaney" ever pick up a 
lacrosse stick in his life? With an impressive 
record of8-5lasr year and dismal results for 
most of the decade, it looks like most 
lacrosse stars would rather seek their for-
tunes elsewhsre.
