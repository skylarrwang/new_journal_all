Sanctuary
WALKING IN 1HROUGH the side entrance, I sit 
down in darkness, a hushed shuffling of 
feet around me the only sound. Douns of 
candles and the heavy smell of incense 
bring my mind to a strange calm. Then the 
singing: One male voice takes up a half-
song, half-chant; a chorus soon joins in. 
The voices are strong, the notes clear and 
unwavering. The songs are prayers, pleas 
for mercy, and hymns of praise. Berween 
each song, all is silent; only candles and 
bent heads are visible. 

This is Compline, a service held at 
Christ Church on Broadway every Sunday 
night. Compline is the name for both this 
Episcopal public prayer service and the 
hour at which the service is held. It is the 
last of the Liturgical Hours, when a small 
choir sings scriptural hymns based on Old 
Testament psalms. This service is held at 
ten PM; other services--Matins, Lauds, 
Prime, Terce, Sext, None, and Vespers-are 
held throughout the day. 

The idea that half an hour of hymns 
could aetract a large follwing of Yale 
students is not necessarily intuitive, bur 
Compline 
attracts 
more 
than 
just 
Episcopalians: Many Compline regulars 
practice other religions or are atheists. Bur 
Christ Church does not seek to convert.
