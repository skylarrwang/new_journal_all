architecture to be photographed for the 
N~ York Times, like the Madison. Perhaps 
Spodick is bitter that the Madison occupies 
the niche he seeks, balancing art ftlms with 
mainstream movies, or worried because the 
Madison m:ty be claiming some of his 
already paltry business. 

Spodick's old friends have now come 
forward as his adversaries, representing 
forces that could crush him before long. 
Provided the York Square survives until the 
trial, life will become a lot harder, Spodick 
admits. "They want to go to trial," he says 
of the studios. "I believe they've already 
committed half a million dollars to keep 
movies out of New Haven. If we go to trial, 
it'll become millions." And who will com-
bat greater Hollywood in the courts? 
Peter Spodick, of course. He is also a 
lawyer-Cleveland State Law School, class 
of '78. He will represent himself against 
Hollywood and his junior high classmate, 
and he will do it while running the theater 
almost by himself. He will also have to sur-
mount considerable obstacles just to reach 
the trial, as the next 13 months will be filled 
with battles and surprises, like the court-
supported request Spodick received several 
days ago from Richard Bowerman. 

"He wants everything," Spodick says. 
"All the details, statements, play dates, 
grosses, everything from the last 1,300 
screen weeks." A screen week is the cine-
marie equivalent of a kilowatt hour; the 
York Square, with three screens, goes 
through three screen weeks every calendar 
week. "That means everything we've· done 
in the last seven years," Spodick says. "Our 
bookkeeper is going crazy." 

There is only one bookkeeper, just as 
there is only one lawyer, who is also the 
manager, just as there is one 81-year-old 
promoter, who is also the owner and 
founder. Robert Spodick still works a full 
week. Although he was diagn~sed with 
throat cancer two years ago-"Too many 
cigarettes," his son explains-Robert does 
most of the advertising. booking. and buy-
ing. Peter does everything else, often work-
ing 70-hour weeks during which he is man-
ager, projectionist, publicist, janitor, and, 
now, lawyer. "If I don't do it, it won't get 
done," he says. "If it rains tonight, I'll be 
on the roof clearing leaves out of the gutter 
so we don't have a flood. If I were to get 
sick for awhile, forget it. The York Square 
closes." 

When asked if his current situation 
reminds him of anything he's seen in the 
movies, Spodick answers quickly enough: 
"James Stewart ... It's A Wontkrfol Lifo." In 
the movie, George Bailey wants co leave 
town and live on his own, but his father 
dies and George has to take over the strug-
gling fumily business. Bailey fights to keep 
the business alive and resist the evil Mr. 
Potter, a rival banker. 

Spodick loves the movie, but doesn't 
take the parallel roo far. Mr. Potter may 
have been treacherous and powerful, but as 
an enemy, he's no march for Redstone, who 
is too large to attack directly. Instead, 
Spodick has had to fight him through the 
studios, which are smaller and more legally 
vulnerable. New Haven's townspeople 
appear less than ready co band together and 
save the theater, as many of them seem to 
harbor a belief that the York Square will 
never actually dose. They don't understand 
the many factors that contribute co a crisis 
of "imminent failure" for the only movie 
theater in a college town. They don't know 
Sumner Redstone. Spodick does, and 
wanes nothing more than to defeat him for 
the York Square and the countless small 
theaters that did nor survive the "squeez.e." 

Spodick will never give up, but victory 
is distant at best, and he is exhausted. 
"'There is a point where you get so tired you 
lose track," he says. Money is also an issue. 
NOVEMBER 10,2000 
Peter isn't paid much, and Robert hasn't 
taken a check in years. He works all week, 
and does it for free. "And y'know what?" 
Peter says, "He's tired too." But while the 
real world generally supplies fewer happy 
endings than do the movies, there are hints 
lately that the city is awakening to the York 
Square. 

KEviN McCLOuD HAD NOT MET Peter 
Spodick when he wrote a series of letters 
trying to save the York Square. McCloud, 
who moved to New Haven earlier this year, 
was a frequent theater-goer and had seen 
enough to know he wanted it to stick 
around . So he wrote three letters to 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard 
Blumenthal and New Haven Mayor John 
DeStefano. He used strong words and 
underlines, urging the Mayor to "~ 
~ 
work with the state attorney 
general" to save the theater. 

"For many years, the practice of first 
distributing movies through such multi-
plexes has sapped the life from the cinema 
industry downtown," DeStefano wrote in 
response. "The Attorney General is consid-
ering active participation in securing the 
right of the York Square Cinemas' efforts to 
receive first-run movies." 

"When I see that letter from the 
mayor," Spodick says, "I am a happy boy. 
The Attorney General cannot take every 
case that comes along. bur he has the right 
to enter on an amicus basis, for harm to 
consumers, and take the case away [for a 
state investigation]." This would bring the 
prosecutorial power of the state to 
Spodick's case, which could convince the 
studios to settle out of court. "That would 
be a dream come true," Spodick says. 

Whether the Attorney General takes 
the case or not, Spodick's mission is the 
same. Under 
CUTPA, plaintiffs must 
demonstrate immediate threat of irrepara-
ble harm if the defendant were not 
restrained. In this case, Spodick is attempt-
ing to restrain the studios' ability to keep 
movies out of downtown New Haven. If 
the York Square does not get fiCst-run 
movies immediately, Spodick says, New 
Haven will never get them again. T he York 
will go out of business and no replacement 
theater would spring up in its place. 

Spodick is equally sure that Showcase 
would never open a theater in New Haven, 
as they have already overbuilt in the sub-
urbs. "They're terrified of who else might 
poach on their rue£ So they build to keep 
competitors out." 

AN AR:riCLE IN THE Tccas Monthly lists 
a dozen stately, beautiful movie houses that 
have been, for various lengths of time, 
dead. They stand unpurchased and unde-
molished for two reasons: No unrelated 
business would fit snugly into the buildings 
as they are, and no one wants to knock 
them down. When two reporters opened 
up the Aztec Theatre in Eagle Pass, TX "a 
score of residentS crowded around to beg a 
quick peek inside or to relate anecdotes 
about the Aztec, and several-including a 
police detective and the city manager-
revealed that they had mer their spouses 
there." The York Square and the Aztec 
share an idealistic belief that people do not 
want a movie theater that it sized for max-
imum efficiency, bur one that is beautiful 
in an intimate and utterly obsolete sort of 
way. 

"The ghosts are gone," Spodick says.
