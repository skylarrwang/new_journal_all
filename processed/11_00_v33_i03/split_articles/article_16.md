·alfway up Broadway, near the center ofNew Haven, the 
York Square Cinema readies for combat. Strategy 
requires a business-as--usual approach, which means that the 
promotional posters stay on the front windows and the poster-
size movie reviews remain in display cases by the doors, all 
below the giant marquee where mismatched letters announce 
the week's features. The reviews and posters were almost cer-
tainly put up by Peter Spodick, who manages the York Square 
and who also filed suit this past spring against the twelve largest 
movie studios in the country. 

Spodick is a busy man. The lawsuit brings more work to a 
job that already provided plenty. It has brought a doz.en ene-
mies who more or less comprise the American motion picture 
industry: Buena Vista (which includes Disney), Columbia, 
Dream Works, MGM, Lion's Gate, Miramax, New Line Cinema, 
Paramount, USA Films, Sony, Universal Studios, and Warner 
Bros. Spodick claims the studios have systematically avoided 
Licensing first-run films in the city of New Haven, forcing resi-
dents to travel to neighboring towns to see new movies. The 
trial is tentatively set to begin December 31, 2001, creating a 
frantic year of preparation in the meantime. 

As he dashes between legal and managerial chores, Spodick 
is hard to find. In fact, 15 minutes before theater doors open on 
a Thursday night, the only place to catch him is the men's 
restroom, where he is whisking across the tiles, paper towels 
bunched under his shoes. "Cleaning guy put too much soap on 
the floor," he says. He circles from stall co door co sink, where 
he stops to splash more water on the floor: "Nature's solvent." 
"Don't be shy," he says, and tosses a mess of towels my way. 
A young employee zips out of a stall and smiles as she grabs 
more rowels. She turns so that now she and Spodick are circling 
each other in the middle of the floor, like dance partners. If 
anyone brings this up later he'll just grin and say, "When scuff 
needs to get done, you shut the fuck up and you do it." 

PETER SPODicK's FATHER, Robert Spodick, opened the Lincoln 
Theatre in New Haven with his cousin Lenny Sampson in 1945· 
Lenny was fresh back from fighting in Japan and Robert, 26, 
had just moved up from New York, where he went to school 
and managed the Little Carnegie, a popular foreign film theater 
next co Carnegie Hall. Neither man bad much money. How 
were they able to start their own theater? Peter laughs. He likes 
this part of the story. 

During World War u, croops en route co Japan stayed in 
Honolulu before shipping out. The island was flooded with 
thousands of bored soldiers, one of whom was Lenny Sampson. 
One day he approached the owner of the on-base movie house. 
which was doing poorly. Lenny said be could double the 
owner's business in exchange for a piece of the profits. Deal. 
Lenny telegrammed Robert to send a reel of Ecstasy, the new 
Hedy Lamarr movie. "She was a great big star," Peter says. 
"Very beautiful." The movie was indeed a business-doubler 
because, as every soldier-age male knew in 1945, .Eatasy has a
