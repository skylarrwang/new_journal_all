a time for the Yale Community to reflect on our 
accomplishments and our vision for the future 
More than two dozen new books highlight

graduates have contributed to culture.

including Richard Benson's beautiful 
look at Yale University during the 20th 
Century entitled A Yale Album ($39.95). 
Other titles now available include the 
Michelin Green Guide to Yale 
University and New Haven.

years, with everything from t-shirts to unique 
collector's items. If your catalog hasn't arrived
