proselytizing," says Rob Lehman, choir-
master of the Church. "We're not trying to 
sell anyone anything." That the Church 
welcomes people of all denominations and 
does not demand religious worship may 
explain why attendance at Compline, but 
not Church membership, has swelled since 
the service was opened to the public at the 
beginning of September. As news of~ 
Compline services has spread through 
word of mouth and public announce-
ments, the usual attendance has grown 
from about 40 to over 160 people. 

Having been a Compline regular for 
the last month and a half, I'm beginning to 
understand the broad appeal. Since high 
school, I have passed through the gates of 
more religions than I can name. I've 
attempted to "become a flower" under the 
low-voiced exhortation of a Buddhist 
monk, fed the cows outside a Hare Krishna 
geodesic dome, and joined a group of 
whirling dervishes at a mystical gathering 
of Sufis, spinning and chanting the names 
of God. I've even spent a week at a 
monastery in Conyers, Georgia, waking 
before four in the morning to make it to 
the first service of the day. Compline is 
another way of satisfying my curiosity 
about other religious cultures. 

For 30 minutes, the service continues; 
then, with no fanfare, it ends. People get up 
slowly and seem unwilling to leave. Some 
genuflect and cross themselves; others walk 
straight out. 

Compline is moving, but it's hard to 
say exactly why. People leaving the Church 
don't provide answers in their parting con-
versations; walking down the Church steps, 
I hear mostly small talk: "I'm cold" or "I 
like the music here." But it seems that 
something deeper is happening that no one 
is expressing. Perhaps this traditional 
prayer service provides a needed spiritual 
ritual for students immersed in a secular 
World; perhaps Compline is a way to clear 
the mind before reentering Yale; or perhaps 
it is simply a quest for relief, a quiet haven 
within New Haven's much louder space. 

And so each Sunday we take half an hour in 
Christ Church before spilling out onto 
Broadway, where we are greeted by the 
SOunds of screeching brakes and car horns. 
It's the last night before the workweek 
starts up again, one among many brief 
Â¥acations, hundreds of urban nights.
