But more importantly, ISS takes active 
steps to help its students reach positions of 
leadership. The Grand Strategy Network, 
as the ISS Annual Report explains, "has 
begun to build a network of individuals 
and institutions trained to think about and 
implement grand strategies in imaginative 
and effective ways." 

This networking 
often takes the form of dinner conversa-
tions, sometimes held at Mory's, between 
guest lecturers and the students of the 
class. While acknowledging the possibility 
that a student may get a job offer from the 
people he or she meets at such social func-
tions, Kennedy states that, "It's much less 
profossionai networking than intelkctuai 
networking." 

People for the American Way organization, 
James Piereson, Executive Direcror of the 
Olin Foundation, is quoted as saying, "We 
invested at the top of society, in 
Washington think tanks and the best uni-
versities, and the idea is [that} this would 
have a much larger impact because they 
were influential places." 

The report suggests that this 
impact reflects the bias of the donors: 
"One Chronicle of High" Education writer 
notes that critics charge Olin with spend-
ing 'millions of dollars to support activities 
that direct!,. challenge the spread of diver-
sity and multiculturalism on campus. Far 
from promoting objective, dispassionate 
scholarship, 
as it claims, the Olin 
Foundation has an explicit political agen-
da, with ties to officials in the Republican 
party.'" The report suggests that the Olin 
Foundation is interested not merely in

want to be in "some sort of position of 
leadership eventually." 

Senior David 
Slifka says, ''I've never been a very good 
networker." He adds, "I'm sure the pro-
fessors would like to see us become world 
leaders, but I think you need more than 
taking 'Grand Strategy' to become one." 

ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NO INFLUENCE over 
what is taught in the class, the foundations 
supporting ISS strongly approve of the 
Grand Strategy Project. The two largest 
donors are the John M. Olin and Smith 
Richardson Foundations, and even though 
most of the funds for the Grand Strategy 
Project come from Smith Richardson, 
both foundations' philosophies of leader-
ship echo that of the Project. In "Buying A 
Movement: Right-Wmg Foundations in 
American Politics," a report by the liberal 
seems tenuous ideo-
logically. Afrer all, international security is 
an i~ue that transcends political distinc-
tions. Even though the instructors of 
"Studies in Grand Strategy" are relatively 
conservative, none of the students with 
whom I spoke thought that a particular 
ideology drove the class. 

So why then have rwo conservative 
foundations taken up ISS as their cause? 
One answer lies in the nature of the study of 
history. "Every generation redefines what 
sort of history it is in," explains Kennedy. 
"It's not surprising that the generation that 
was born between the wars wanted to 
understand war, because they just went 
through two of the biggest wars in history. 
[Today], some people think diplomatic his-
tory is the study of power, and since power 
is bad and made of old white males, they 
replace military history with something like 
environmental history." 

THE NEW JouRNAL 


But does the study of power in the 
form of grand strategy necessarily lead to 
conservative conclusions? The answer may 
lie in how one defines grand strategy. 

Some studenrs in the class, such as Ranjarl::' 
Goswani, doubt if grand strategy even 
exists. Hill is contented with a means-to-
an-end 
definition. 
But 
Theodore 
Bromund, Associate Director of ISS, has a 
more specific concept of grand strategy. 
"In the business context," he says, "grand 
strategy is profit maximization by obeying 
legal and ethical norms. In the government 
context, it is wealth distributed in a certain 
way." While he doesn't define these ethical 
norms, Bromund suggests that ethics are a 
necessary element of grand strategy. A 
poster of Winston Churchill behind his 
desk reflects this ideal: Churchill is drawn 
with his finger raised, saying "Deserve 
Victory." Bromund says that he likes the 
morality implied. One student in the class, 
Ram Fish of the School of Management, 
says, "Tactics is about how to win battles. 
Strategy is about how to win the war. And 
grand strategy is about what wars to fight." 

BUT GRANO STRATEGY, in its essence, is not 
about ends. Grand strategy is the study of 
means, a strategy of how to achieve one's 
desired ends. Grand strategy seeks to teach 
the powerful how to get what they want, 
whatever that may be. 

Many of the studentS in the grand 
strategy seminar simply hope to learn from 
an interesting class, and are humble about 
the idea of leadership. But despite their 
feelings, one thing is clear: Taught by some 
of the world's most influential professors, 
treated to dinners with corporate CEOs, 
observed by the CIA, and networked with 
one another, the handpicked studentS of 
the Grand Strategy Project are not only 
supposed to learn about the world's lead-
ers, but to become them.
