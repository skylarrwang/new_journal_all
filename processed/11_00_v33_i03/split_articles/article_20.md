When evening hit the Cheshire County fair, the cotton-candy stalls, the games, and the rides ceased 
to operate one by one. All present moved to a nearby dark field for the crowning event of the night. 
Springsteen's "Born in the USA" crackled on the outdoor speakers. The days were growing shorter 
and colder and oranger and counties across America were marking the occasion. A man inter-
rupted the music to emphasize how long it had been since there had been fireworks at the Cheshire 
County Fall Festival: two year~. Everyone cheered and huddled into plastic furniture, gawking at 
the sparkly sky. 


Most of the people present were longtime residents of the county. Some stood in makeshift 
stalls selling hearty New England fare to brace us against the cold. Others milled about, visiting old 
friends. Their hipper children sucked on glowsticks, which shone eerie lavender and toxic green 
rough their cheeks. Still others stood in the long line to buy tickets for the rides. Then there were 
e carnies: lounging against rusty rides, winking at children, and flirting with teenagers. Finally, 
was a crew of miscellaneous outsiders: a group of black-veiled Muslim women; their ornery 
not savvy enough to have glow-in-the-dark pacifiers; a few college students who had grown 
up far from this place. My friends and I breathed in the sky along with the rest, transfixed by such 
carnival energy only a few miles from campus. 


We were hobked. Most weekends in September and October, we piled in a car and scout-
out county fairs around New Haven. We checked out prize-winning pumpkins, complete with 
doctored pictures of the winners "surfing" on their pumpkins on an artificial sea. We ten-
...... ~ ..... u scratched scrawny goats in petting zoos, trying not to offend the pancake-faced girls who 
jealously tended them. We stumbled into expositions where merchants hawked nail-buffers 
that would make our own nails shine like the classiest fakes, magical 
chamois that would gulp up stains no matter how stubborn, 
and cooking ware that would serve up meals so perfect 
that our intestines would rumble in appreciation for 


days. We almost rode in a hot-air balloon, scrutinized a butter sculpture for hours, and watched a 
determined pack of Amish musicians serenade indigent fair-goers. We dangled upside-down in 
mid-air with small Pakistani children who complained that America was "stupid and boring" and 
grumbled about how loudly we were screaming. We won no prizes on the midway and missed see-
ing Def Leppard play, but chugged the best vanilla milkshakes ever and made our hands sticky with 
swirls and swirls of cotton candy. 


When county fair season ended, the residents of each county retreated into their homes 
eager to plan next year's fun. My friends and I returned to our desolate dorm rooms, sulky and dis-
contented.
