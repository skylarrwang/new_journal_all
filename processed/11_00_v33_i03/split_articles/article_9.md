Renaissance Man
JAZz AGE liAtu.EM HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE 
in the American popular imagination. The 
words "Harlem Renaissance" conjure up 
images of hip jazz clubs, stylish men and 
women strutting their finest on Lenox 
Avenue, and an artistic scene exploding 
with new black talent. Hot Harlem is no 
longer just a train ride away, but those who 
missed it can still catch a glimpse by head-
ing for the silent sepulchre of Beinecke 
Library. 

Beinecke may seem a bit of a let-down 
compared to the Harlem of the 1920s: A 
studious hush replaces the tunes of ragtime, 
suits are business, not zoot, and the place is 
more conducive to tedious scholarship 
than artistic inspiration. But deep within 
the vault lies the James Weldon Johnson 
Memorial Collection of American Negro 
Arts and Letters, the world's defmitive col-
lection of manuscripts, papers, and archives 
for black writers of the Harlem Renaissance 
and beyond. 

Almost as fascinating as the collection 
itself is the story of how the papers carne to 
Yale. They arrived through the efforts of a 
white man named Carl Van Vechten, a 
novelist, critic, photographer, and patron 
of the arrs. Van Vechten was a friend and 
patron of many artists of the Harlem 
Renaissance, and his own works clued a 
number of downtown whites into what was 
happening in uptown Harlem. Van 
Vechten was also friends with many white 
artists and intellectuals of the time and rec-
ognized the need to bridge the gap between 
the two groups. He envisioned having 
some of his black friends donate their 
papers and art to a predominantly white 
school, and a corresponding number of his 
white friends donate their works to a tradi-
tionally black school, in the hope that their 
gifts would encourage racial understand-
ing. 

Van Vechten decided upon Fisk 
University as the black school of choice, 
and then turned to the question of its white 
counterpart. He had become involved with 
lily-white Yale while helping Gertrude 
Stein donate her papers. 
The school 
impressed Van Vechten with its strong col-
lection, as well as its willingness to accept 
archival materials in addition to manu-
scripts. In 1941, Van Vechten and the 
widow of James Weldon Johnson, novelist, 
songwriter, and the fllst black head of the 
National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP), decided to 
donate Johnson's manuscripts, scrapbooks, 
correspondence, and photographs to Yale, 
forming the core of the current collection. 

Soon after, Van Vechten convinced Georgia 
O'Keeffe to donate a number of paintings 
that had belonged to her husband Alfred 
Steiglicz-including works by 
Pablo 
Picasso, Paul cezanne, and O'Keeffe her-
self-to Fisk University. 

In the following years the Yale collec-
tion expanded, as author Langston Hughes 
started to donate his papers in the 1950s 
and left the remainder upon his death in 
1967. Other major collections followed, 
including those of author Richard Wright, 
Walter White, the second black head of the 
NAACP, and Jean Toomer, of Can~ fame. 

Meanwhile, the value of Fisk's collec-
tion boomed with the rise of modern art; 
today it is worth almost twice the 
University's $xoo million endowment. Fisk 
is forbidden from selling any of the collec-
tion but has recently taken to sending it on 
tour to raise money for the school. 

Van Vecluen died in 1964. With the 
exception of the manuscripts of his novels, 
which he left to the New York Public 
Library in the 19305, he gave all of his 
papers to Yale, as well as his massive collec-
tion of original photographic prints and 
negatives, which includes many of the 
major artistic figures, black and white, of 
the 1930s and 1940s. 

The James Weldon Johnson collection 
also includes scattered gems, such as w.E.B. 
DuBois's senior thesis, with corrections by 
his advisor William James, as well as frag-
ments of]ames Baldwin's first, unpublished 
novel, written when he was 17 years old. 

The library recently acquired the Simpson 
Collection, consisting of thousands of rare 
photographs of black families from the 
nineteenth and early twentieth century. 

Admirtedly, Yale doesn't buzz like 
Harlem on Saturday night, and bands at 
Toads can hardly compare to Duke 
Ellington at the Cotton Club. But deep 
within the Beinecke reside the eloquent 
remnants of the Harlem Renaissance. For 
those intrepid enough to look. they show 
the progress of genius in scribbles and 
sketches.
