and speaks plainly about the success of ISS, which has an annual 
budget of over $8oo,ooo. "When I talk to my buddies in the med 
school, going biking or running, they talk about grants of millions. 
We look like small beans compared to them. But for somebody in 
the humanities, like Mideast studies, ISS looks like a 
150-pound gorilla." Kennedy speaks enthusiastical-
ly and openly, and it is not hard to see why so many 
want him to stay in charge. 

Kennedy is well aware of the academic trends 
that lie behind the rapid growth of ISS. "It means 
that when people worried that everyone was switch-
ing to gender studies or black studies, we can say 
that there are exceptions. We are one of the only 
places in the country that does this, and I think the 
foundations [that fund research] know this." It was 
this frustration with the current state of academics 
that led to the idea for the Grand Strategy Project. 

About three years ago, Kennedy began speaking 
with his neighbor and friend John Gad<f!s who was 
giving a series of talks about globalization at the 
time. "We were both thinking that specialization in 
the academy had become horribly entrenched," 
explains Kennedy. "There were very few attempts to 
look at the thing as a whole." At an ISS sponsored 
weekend retreat attended by Kennedy, Hill, 
Bracken, Donald Kagan, and Nno York Times columnist Thomas 
Friedman, the idea for a diplomatic and military history seminar 
emerged. The class would differ from the standard seminar in one 
key aspect: Its goal was not simply to teach what had happened, but 
to train students for what could happen. More than a class about 
ideas on international security, ISS became a class on leadership, and 
its instructors, who ask for a resume along with applications, 
acknowledge that they look to accept potential leaders into it. 

Leadership is both stressed by and embodied in Charles Hill, 
one of the instructors of "Studies in Grand Strategy." 
A 
Distinguished Fellow at ISS, Hill has served as Chief of Staff of the 
Department of State and worked as Assistant Secretary General and 
By Alexander Dworkowitz 
Special Policy Advisor to the United Nations. While Kennedy 
speaks of grand strategy as one of many aspects of the study of his-
tory, Hill suggests that it is the most important because it is the one 
that defines leadership. "This [has long been] part of the education 
of those who were expected to become leaders. If 
you're going to be in a position of leadership, you 
need to attend to every aspect from the budget to 
personalities to power to external limitations; you're 
going to need a comprehensive view of all aspects if 
you're going to make the institution work effective-
ly." 

Hill envisions the grand strategy course teach-
ing its students a certain way to think. "In general, 
the understanding of how you approach things in a 
grand strategic way has eroded," he says. "Life has 
been more fragmented." Hill argues that there has 
been a decline in the use of grand strategy in diplo-
macy and business, and that this endangers world 
stability. Hill sees a direct connection between the 
changes in academia in the 196os--deparrments and 
specialization becoming standard features of the 
university and its faculty-and the lack of vision of 
many of today's leaders, especially in terms of for-
eign policy. In order to improve the world of tomor-
row, one must improve the world's leaders, and in 
order to improve the world's leaders, one must change the way they 
are trained. 

It is the idea that an institution like Yale exists to train leaders 
that attracts so much attention to ISS and the Grand Strategy 
Project. In his recent book, The Lexus and the Olive T"e, a "guide-
book on how to follow the drama [of globalization)," Thomas 
Friedman writes, "The Yale International Relations historians Paul 
Kennedy and John Lewis Gaddis see,one of their jobs as training the 
next generation of American strategists. To their great credit, they 
have been exploring how to broaden the curriculum in order to pro-
duce a new generation of strategists who can think as globalists and 
not just particularists."
