ESSAY 
â€¢ 
Deliverance 
Brother Stephen White, born-again Christian preacher, modern-day "saint" and self-proclaimed "Soldier of Christ," has positioned himself no more than 50 yards from my dorm room window for the past two days. His constant stream of jeers and proclamations and the shouted responses of indignant Yale students seep in as I immerse myself in microeconomics and French philosophy. 
Campus buzz is all about the "crazy Christian guy on Wall Street." Brother Stephen's arrival at Yale, with his wife, kids, and apprentice Brother Jeff in tow, coincides with National Coming Out Day 2000. Signs of support for the event are ubiquitous on our progressive campus: Small pink banners fly from campus windows, pink triangle and "Straight bur not narrow" pins adorn backpacks, and the Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender Co-operative has set up a door on Cross Campus with "The Closet" markered across it in large black letters. Just across Wall Street from this display, Brother Stephen attracts quite a crowd. Yalies usually are self-involved: Political rallies and demonstrations, even for causes that most students agree with, consistently draw fewer than 40 people. But for two days, a mass of at least that number has surrounded Brother Stephen almost continuously as he prances and jumps and howls and shakes his fist, scathingly denouncing everyone from homosexuals to tree-huggers to potheads to Catholics. I skipped two classes just to listen. 

It is a warm October afternoon and dozens of Yalies stop on their way home from class to watch the spectacle. Someone in the crowd mentions that Brother Stephen is leaving Yale this same evening and heading to Philadelphia. This last point catches my attention: I too am on my way to Philadelphia, to visit a friend at the University of Pennsylvania, and I need a ride. 

After a moment's hesitation, I approach Laurie, Brother Stephen's wife, who is sitting on a collapsible lawn chair with their two children (Philip, 2, and Wesley, 9 months) in her lap, and strike up a conversation with her. I manage to bring up Philadelphia almost immediately and within minutes, feeling only a twinge of guile for so shamelessly taking advantage of her Christian charity, have secured a spot for myself in their car. 

I run up to my room to grab a bag, let my roommates know where I'm going, and, more importantly, how I'm getting there. Disbelief quickly turns into a mix of amusement and concern. They advise, "I wouldn't ride with him if I were you. That man is mentally ill. He thinks he's a saint." And, "Are you really going to deal with six hours of him preaching at you? I think I would kill him by the end." I smile, shrug, and head out the door, prepared for six righteous hours of hellfire and brimstone on the road to the City of Brotherly Love. 

BROTHER STEPHEN SPEAKS IN A SQUEAKY ARKANSAS DRAWL, peppering short sentences with proclamations of "Praise the Lord" and "Praise be to Jesus." If written, his speech would contain frequent exclamation points and italicized phrases. He is an old-time Southern traveling preacher, straight out of a Flannery O'Connor novel. 

As we squeeze into his plain white Mazda, Brother Stephen tells me that he's been craving a burger all day. I direct him to a Burger King down Whalley Avenue. I'm a bit nervous about the whole endeavor: In his preaching earlier in the day, Brother Stephen had taken some decisive swipes at inner cities and black culture, especially "reefer-sucking, fornicating" rap icons like Tupac Shakur. Mixing Brother Stephen with the standard New Haven crowd seems like a recipe for disaster. 

After seeing Brother Stephen in action for the past two days, his change in demeanor when we get in the car is disarming. We make small talk; he asks me where I'm from, what I'm studying, why I decided to go to Yale, what my parents do. Though an occasional "Praise the Lord" or "Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" still pops up, he is low-key and down-to-earth, someone who has an easy time talking to people and clearly enjoys it. He's almost someone I'd like to sit down and have a beer with-if we'd met in a different context, and if he drank alcohol. Even when the conversation takes a turn towards religion and philosophy, he remains calm, and by the time we reach the Burger King, he knows the basic facts of my life: I am a Jew; I am agnostic; and I have violated more than one of the Ten Commandments. 

I go sit in a booth with Laurie and her two sons while Brother Stephen and Brother Jeff stand in line. The contrast is almost comic: The two preachers, blond hair gelled into submission, wait politely in dark suits among the mostly black, casually dressed clientele. But after a minute, I look back and both are jabbering away at the person next to them in line, Brother Stephen animated, Brother Jeff poised. A minute later, Brother Stephen is offering his email address to a teenager wearing a leather Fubu Jacket, red Yankees hat turned sideways, and a thick gold chain around his neck. The teenager accepts the card, and gives Brother Stephen his phone number. 

BROTHER STEPHEN CLAIMS that he was called to preach when he was 19 years old, six years born again and living in Arkansas. He was "saved" at thirteen. I can only imagine what sins lay in his closet at that tender age. But, no matter-he was willing to make the "transformative atonement." 

Brother Stephen has spent most of the past ten years of his life
