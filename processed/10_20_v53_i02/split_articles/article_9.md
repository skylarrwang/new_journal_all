tectural heritage,” the NHPT was founded in 1961 in 
opposition to Yale’s plans to demolish the historic home 
of James Dwight Dana, a significant Yale geologist, at 
34 Hillhouse Ave. The Trust was successful, and the 
house was registered in 1966. Today, it holds Yale’s 
Department of Statistics and Data Science. 

Plattus described Yale’s frequent expansion as an 
attempt to control the edge of campus—and not always 
in a manner respectful of the preferences of New Haven 
residents. As a sprawling presence in New Haven, 
Yale historically has played a complicated role when 
it comes to preservation. Plattus pointed me to Associ-
ate Professor of Urbanism Elihu Rubin and filmmaker 
Elena Oxman’s half-hour documentary, “On Broadway: 
A New Haven Streetscape,” which reported on Yale’s 
purchase and subsequent renovation of properties on 
Broadway. 

Produced when Rubin and Oxman were students at 
the School of Architecture, the circa 2000 documen-
tary has an indie feel. It features many Yale figures, 
including Plattus himself and the renowned art histo-
rian and Yale professor Vincent Scully. Between inter-
views, the film includes clips of Broadway that would 
be unrecognizable to today’s Yale students. Many store-
fronts belonged to small, multigenerational family-run 
businesses. Some of the changes are due to unavoidable 
economic trends; it seems unlikely that the typewriter 
repair store or Cutler’s Records and Tapes could possi-
bly remain afloat today. But many residents and busi-
ness owners additionally felt that Yale was marking the 
neighborhood with its own brand. 

At one point in the documentary, Joe Fahey, then 
director of operations for University Properties, 
describes Yale’s vision for Broadway, one in which chain 
stores would exist alongside and help to support busi-
nesses run by New Haveners. Seated at a conference 
table, he concludes, “That’s how Broadway’s gonna 
work.” Rubin aptly characterized Fahey’s comment as 
reflective of “the hubris of a lot of city planners”—the 
idea that such a broad swath of city can be planned and 
shaped according to a single vision. Peter Spodick of 
York Square Cinema objected to this notion in the con-
text of downtown New Haven: “All these components 
of downtown were not things that were planted, they 
evolved over hundreds of years.” The owners of Cutler 
Records and Quality Wines both described the sudden 
changes as equivalent to losing a family. Yale’s determi-
nation to homogenize and strategize with their property 
on Broadway impacted not only the business but also 
the lives of those already there. 

When working on smaller-scale development proj-
ects, Andrew MacPartland of Elm City Architects 
consciously tries to respond to both the needs of the 
area and the expectations of preservationists. A practic-
ing architect, MacPartland was hired to gain approval 
from the local historic district commission for a proj-
ect in Wooster Square. In designing a new home he, 
like Yale, left his mark on a New Haven neighborhood. 

MacPartland, however, had a personal connection to 
the Wooster Square neighborhood, where his grandfa-
ther settled after emigrating from Italy. He said that this 
link was central to enforcing a sense of responsibility 
not only to his client but also to the surrounding neigh-
borhood. He advocates for architects to be “humble 
enough [to] get a consensus of opinion”—from preser-
vation organizations but also by seeking out input from 
those in the community. That humility stands in stark 
contrast to Yale’s confidence regarding the future of 


Yale’s desire for expansion and emphasis on effi-
ciency can clash with the priorities of New Haveners. 
Susan Godshall, who has long-standing connections to 
both Yale and the city of New Haven, spoke to the com-
plexity of the problem. Godshall is a graduate of the 
School of Architecture and Yale Law School and serves 
as the treasurer of the NHPT. She has also held various 
positions in the Chamber of Commerce and the Coun-
sel’s office for the City of New Haven, and was Assistant 
Secretary of Yale for almost a decade. Godshall speaks 
in the classic vocabulary of preservationists—referring 
to the “character” of a neighborhood or the success 
of the NHPT’s date plaque initiative. Like Professor 
Plattus, she described areas of tension being especially 
“around the edges” of Yale. But Godshall also explicitly 
emphasized that “it doesn’t serve anyone to have a per-
manent adversarial relationship.” Although the NHPT 
was initially founded in opposition to a Yale project, 
it has also operated as a partner and consultant to the 
University. As MacPartland recognized with respect to 
his project in Wooster Square, collaboration is essential 
to preservation. 

In historic cities across the United States, one of 
the largest obstacles to preservation is a chronic lack 
of resources. MacPartland admitted that to design and 
construct a historic-grade building from scratch—as he 
and his client did in Wooster Square— “comes with a 
price tag.” In New Haven, where more than 25% of res-
idents live in poverty, the initial capital needed to begin 
such a project is often hard to come by. For those who 
own historic structures and lack the financial resources 
to renovate, the channels available are present but lim-
ited, as Godshall explained. Owners who complete a 
major renovation can receive tax credit from the state; 
for those looking to make modest repairs, the NHPT 
offers grants from their Historic Structures Fund. These 
grants range only from $1,000 to $4,000, however, and 
are made on a one-to-one matching basis. This means that 
whether residents are making a larger renovation or are 
looking to apply for financial support, they will need to 
start with at least some capital. 


The prevailing critique of preservation organizations 
concerns this difficulty: that it is unrealistic to expect the 
vast majority of Americans to have the financial flexibility 
and time required to make historically accurate renova-
tions. As Rubin put it, there is often a trade-off between 
the desire to “preserve the building but [a failure to] pre-
serve the people.” When practiced to the extreme, Rubin 
worries that historic preservation can “change a city into 
a museum of itself.” An extensively preserved city may 
become a static relic, prevented from evolving by the 
high-value placed on structures of the past. He cited Euro-
pean cities like Venice, which rely heavily on tourism for 
revenue. But even when preservation is more limited, he 
pointed out that gentrification is still a legitimate and 
growing concern, threatening the existing residents. Plat-
tus admitted that in many successful case studies—such as 
past preservation efforts in Providence, Rhode Island, or 
Havana, Cuba—gentrification may be inevitable. College 
Hill in Providence is now a relatively upscale neighbor-
hood near Brown University, where preservationists used 
an entrepreneurial model to put profits from successful 
renovations into additional projects in the area. Plattus 
believes this could be viable in areas of New Haven, 
where affiliates of the University may be looking for his-
toric homes. He also said, however, that it is possible, if 
at times challenging, to preserve without gentrifying. He 
pointed to Pittsburgh as a model, where he said that cer-
tain inner-city neighborhoods successfully preserved his-
torical structures while also retaining a significant portion 
of the existing population. 

Organizations like the NHPT work to protect history 
throughout cities nationwide, but Abby Roth, representa-
tive of Ward 7 on the Board of Alders, also hopes that pres-
ervation might be an endeavor supported by independent 
citizens from the ground up. Roth told me that there are 
many New Haveners who want to share their voices when 
it comes to the changes in their neighborhoods, even 
when there might not be existing channels. Roth grew up 
in Springfield, Massachusetts, and says that her passionate 
advocacy for preservation stemmed from growing up in 
historic cities in New England. As an Alder, Roth has a 
direct say in New Haven governance, but not everyone 
has this privilege. For individuals who want to participate, 
she emphasized Community Management Teams as pos-
sible channels. These public meetings consist of presen-
tations on major events in a neighborhood, information 
which is voluntarily shared by the city of New Haven, 
police, or developers. Yet Roth still worries that there’s a 
silent subset of residents who don’t, won’t, or can’t have 
a voice in these matters due to the self-selecting nature of 
these forums. 

When it comes to preservation, concerns about 
resources and representation mirror worries about who 
gets to decide how and where New Haveners live. Yale 
has the wealth and influence to rival that of the city gov-
ernment. And as Plattus commented, even the NHPT 
may be outmatched in a direct confrontation with Yale 
or other developers, which generally have more extensive 
resources. At the same time, many New Haveners may 
chafe against both Yale’s infringement on their neighbor-
hoods and a historic district commission’s regulations on 
their homes, but won’t have the means to respond. 

Historic preservation is easily simplified and reduced 
by critics. But we all know that “place” matters. The 
spaces in which we work, study, and live impact what we 
do and how we feel. The predominant risk of both preser-
vation and development is that those who actually inhabit 
these spaces are ignored. Both Rubin and Plattus clarified 
that preservation is not only about preserving histories, 
but also about perpetuating a community. Appearances 
are important, but only so far as they affect, as Godshall 
described it, the “integrity” of the area. As I understood 
it, Godshall meant physical, historical integrity. But as 
MacPartland first emphasized, that integrity is also directly 
tied to the neighborhoods in which buildings stand and 
the people who walk past them every day. As students, we 
live at Yale but also in New Haven. Plattus described how 
it often takes a catastrophic loss—such as the demolition 
of Old Penn Station in New York—to motivate meaning-
ful support for preservation. But whether by taking a long 
walk to get to know the city better, attending a Commu-
nity Management Team meeting, or directly advocating 
for the salvation of a historic Yale building, there are so 
many unexplored avenues for students to conscientiously 
engage. Even if only for four years, the Elm City is our 
home and a place which we can engage with and influ-
ence for the better, starting with the physical places that 
matter to us most.
