more broadly endorses “socially responsible invest-
ment guidelines” and “endowment justice” in her 
platform—a theme Ashe is hesitant to give a stark 
“yes” or “no” to, citing lack of enough information 
to make an informed call. He did tell me, though, 
that “investments should be along lines that promote 
a good return” because of the financial importance 
of the endowment to the university’s operations, and 
these investments should be “consistent with efforts 
to promote a clean environment and climate for the 
world.”


In explaining why he doesn’t prioritize divest-
ment as Thomas does, Ashe enumerated his belief 
that one can only affect so much change at a time, 
and the issue of transparency is paramount for him. 
He differentiated himself from Thomas, saying “she 
takes positions on ten or fifteen different issues… I 
don’t think any of the others can occur until we have 
transparency and a new system of electing alumni 
fellows.” Politically, the two alumni are split as well: 
Ashe is a Rrepublican, while Thomas’s work for Sen-
ator Warren places her solidly on the left.


But however each decides to push their pol-
icy goal(s), the two certainly share a strong belief 
in public accessibility and accountability—and 
they think the current rules are frankly ridiculous. 
Thomas wrote to me, “There is nothing in the scope 
of the Yale Corporation’s meetings that requires, 
or deserves, such secrecy. Even secret meetings of 
the United States House and Senate pertaining to 
sensitive topics such as national security are typi-
cally released to the public within 30 years.” Ashe 
summed things up more pithily, drawing a similar 
contrast to federal agencies: “It defies any logic. It 
makes no sense… This is not the CIA or the FBI.”


My conversation with the two Corporation hope-
fuls fired me up to scream “open up the minutes!”, 
but Hill’s rationale also rang true. I’m torn. First, 
Ashe lamented to me that the board’s secrecy dis-
courages “robust discussion,” but Hill then suggested 
that the only way to have productive and honest con-
versation is behind closed doors.


After the conclusion of my second conversation 
with Ashe, though, where I recounted to him some 
of Hill’s points, I began to be more and more con-
vinced that the secrecy is truly over- the- top. “I’ve 
served on many public boards,” Ashe said, “I don’t 
recall a time when the immediate release [of min-
utes]or being  televised has inhibited discussion.” He 
called Hill’s point that openness results in self-cen-
sorship “a very weak excuse.” And furthermore, he 
pointed out to me that at the present moment, the 
Corporation does not even release meeting agendas 
or the resolutions passed. What do either of these 
have to do with protecting the careers or personal 
lives of the group’s members?


Even if the fifty50-year rule were repealed or 
substantially reduced, Corporation meetings still 
would not be fully public. The boardroom within 
Woodbridge Hall, likely replete with glamorously 
upholstered chairs, a long wooden table, and those 
Yale-branded single-use water bottles, will remain a 
figment of students’ imaginations. Releasing meet-
ing minutes is a relatively small change in the larger 
context of wholly open meetings. Yes, the belief of 
Corporation members that the sanctity of Wood-
bridge Hall allows for ideological freedom is accu-
rate and perhaps holds some water. But the way 
Ashe and Thomas discuss the policies of secrecy—as 
outrageously excessive—feels salient. Because if the 
minutes are opened by the time I have grandkids, 
what does it matter what the Yale Corporation talked 
about this year? At that point,  you might as well seal 
them forever.


As morbid as it is, many of today’s Corporation 
members will be dead, or nearing it, in fifty 50 years. 
Perhaps decisions as grave as backing fossil fuels 
ought to come back to haunt those who made these 
calls, exactly as Hill worries they could. Because 
public pressure originates for a reason, and in the 
context of cataclysmic issues like greenhouse gas 
emissions, a very good one: our future.
