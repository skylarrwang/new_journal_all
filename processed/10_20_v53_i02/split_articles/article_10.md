n the summer of 2019, six goats took up residence 
at Edgewood Park. They spent months munch-
ing their way through the park’s poison ivy and Japa-
nese knotweed — both invasive species. The goats 
were brought to the city in a collaboration between 
Green Goats and the Friends of Edgewood Park, a 
volunteer-led group that keeps Edgewood Park afloat. 

Friends of Edgewood Park are just one example of the 
vital role these volunteer-led organizations have taken 
on in maintaining and beautifying the parks that , 
especially in a time when New Haven’s city govern-
ment has not had the capacity to do so. 

In his proposed budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal 
year, New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker moved to 
eliminate the Department of Parks, Recreation, and 
Trees and merge its duties with the Department of 
Public Works and the Department of Youth Ser-
vices in order to make the departments more effi-
cient and prevent repetitive programs. The Board 
of Alders voted to approve the proposal on May 26. 
On July 1, the New Haven Parks Department ceased 
to exist, and two new departments, Youth Services 
and Recreation and Parks and Public Works, took 
its place. The maintenance side of parks, including 
trash pick-up and tree removal, is now handled by 
Parks and Public Works, while recreation and out-
door activities fall under Youth Services and Rec-
reation. 

As the three departments converted into two 
new ones, the budgets shifted as well. The com-
bined budget of the three departments dropped by 
$86,295 between 2019 and 2020 as they realigned 
into two. The City’s overall budget, on the other 
hand, increased by $11,349,022 between 2019 and 
2020.

The long-term effects of the merger remain 
unclear, especially because most youth programs 
were cancelled this summer due to the pandemic. 
Initiatives like the one that brought goats to Edge-
wood won’t be affected because they operate sep-
arately from the government. But still, even with 
the new and supposedly more efficient alignment, 
maintenance of the parks is no easy feat. “I know 
how hard [our maintenance staff] works to keep 
the city clean,” said William Dixon, Deputy Desk 
Director of Recreation. “Every day getting up for 
work is a challenge, figuring out who dumped what 
on a Monday morning and where the trash is at.”

Dixon has worked with the Parks Department 
for 19 years, although he now reports to the Youth 
Services Department. In this position, he runs rec-
reational programs, manages permits, and plans 
events. Day to day, he spends much of his time in 
the park. “I’m an outdoors guy,” he said. After work, 
he drives through the park, seeing who’s around. 
“I see what’s going on, I see who’s using the park.”
