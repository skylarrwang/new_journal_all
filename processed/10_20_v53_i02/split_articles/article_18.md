round of commands––“Walk up! Right there!”––and 
Chip sprinted to the edge of the lake. After several 
laps around, Santopietro issued the final phrase––
“Get in!”––and Chip dove into the water. The geese 
flew off into the sky––dozens marshalling themselves 
into a “V”––and disappeared beyond some clouds. 
Chip strolled back to us, looked for a clear patch of 
dirt, and, finding one, wiggled around there until he 
was dry. The chase was over.    


Geese can’t be chased into oblivion, but they can 
certainly be shuffled around and made someone 
else’s problem. Thirty years ago in The New Yorker, 
Adam Gopnik described a similar kind of transient 
peace with rats in New York City. The technique’s 
three commandments were to contain them, confine 
them, and convince them to leave. The goal with 
both rats and geese is to get them to go––where to 
isn’t the point.  


No one has sympathy for rats, but plenty do for 
geese. The ancients didn’t question their nobility. 
In Rome, geese were considered sacred to Juno and 
kept in domestic supply for rituals. When the Gauls 
invaded the city in 390 BC at the Battle of Allia, the 
Roman historian Livy credits the geese who sounded 
the alarms with saving the republic. Nowadays, the 
defenders of geese again say these are birds of prin-
ciple: they mate for life, look after their young, and 
care for their sick. They’ve adjusted to an environ-
ment engineered by humans and have become one 
of its facts. Earlier this year in the New Haven Reg-
ister, Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals, 
an international animal advocacy organization based 
in Darien, CT, proposed a way to coexist with resi-
dent geese: “[Canada geese] aren’t going away…the 
only thing to do is clean up after them.” Feral cites 
successful cleanup programs in Ottawa and Boston as 
alternatives to harassment, roundups, egg treatment, 
organized slaughter––even anti-goose vigilantism. 
New Haven County is no stranger to acts of anti-
goose vigilante justice. In the last ten years, the 
county’s seen a string of road rage episodes targeting 
geese. In 2017, a driver deliberately hit and killed 13 
geese in Waterbury; in 2018, a man plowed through 
a “multitude” of geese, killing a gosling; and in 2010, 
a beloved resident goose in Meriden named Buddy 
was killed and a letter of intent left at the scene. 
The town raised a $2,000 reward for the killer’s 
capture. The goose problem has all the trappings 
of war––its own bellicose sides, peace activists, and 
casualties––and bespeaks a temper in American life 
that, from time to time, explodes. Short of training 
resident geese to resume their migratory routes––a 
method proven successful in the late 1980s and 
early ‘90s––we’ll have to accept the goose’s year-
round permanence in the national landscape: 
They’re with us now, and they like it here. These 
birds have an urge for staying.


Perhaps one day, with a serious effort to reestab-
lish migratory routes, millions more will be flying 
north and south, but for now on Chapel Street, the 
only Canada goose you’ll see migrating is a thou-
sand-dollar parka. For the moment, the appear-
ance and disappearance of flocks of these down 
coats mark the change of seasons more than geese 
in chevron formation. But should you ever be in 
the right place to see 500 geese take wing from 
the ground, Connecticut Goose Solutions’ Jamie 
North, a veteran chaser, has one word of advice: 
“Duck.”
