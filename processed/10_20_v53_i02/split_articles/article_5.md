Love at Yale will find its way.
Love Under 
Quarantine

reshly ousted from campus amid a global pandemic, 
junior Anna Albright returned home for the summer 
and fell for an old friend. We were speaking over Zoom from 
our respective apartments in New Haven, both back for a 
remote, distanced semester. The grainy video quality made 
it difficult to gauge exactly how she was feeling, but she was 
willing to reflect openly about her love life—both during 
lockdown and at Yale.


In Albright’s experience, it’s difficult to create and 
maintain a relationship at Yale, and she has had little suc-
cess doing so on campus. “We have this go-getter attitude 
[with] club positions and internships, where we think that 
if we just work hard and have confidence, we’ll get what 
we want,” Albright said. “We take that approach, also, 
when it comes to our love lives. But that’s not how love 
works.” 


The relaxed environment of lockdown allowed for 
Albright to organically develop a relationship with an 
old high school friend of hers, Noah*. When they found 
themselves back at home in mid-March, away from their 
respective colleges and usual busy schedules, their rela-
tionship bloomed. They took up running together and 
spent weeks training for a half-marathon together. During 
their practice, they realized that they had developed feel-
ings for one another. But, in line with the slow-paced life 
of quarantine, Albright and Noah felt no need to rush into 
things too quickly.  


When asked about love on campus under normal cir-
cumstances, Albright said she noticed many romantic 
relationships here at Yale to be “transactional.” Students, 
she thought, tended to immediately weigh whether a new 
person would be a viable partner. This also leads students 
to leap into relationships relatively quickly.  She had 
observed a culture of seeing a romantic relationship as 
another achievement or accomplishment in “having your 
life together.” 


When Albright returned to New Haven for the fall, the 
relationship didn’t quite fit into the picture and she broke 
it off. Although she thinks fondly of Noah, it became 
stressful to maintain the same closeness that they had 
enjoyed at home. 


“I preferred to be single and fully present with my peo-
ple here [at Yale], rather than caught up with someone 
who was far away,” she told me.   


The COVID-19 pandemic has predictably disrupted 
the ebb and flow of love and dating at Yale, usually so fast-
paced and chaotic. The unexpected departure from cam-
pus and uncertainty of the future has upset even our best-
laid plans. But love is not at all put on pause; it’s found 
ways to flourish and shift in unanticipated ways. While 
distance has proved to be the breaking point for some, 
others found solace in love or reached for new, creative 
ways to forge connections.

Will*, a sophomore living on campus this semester, felt 
as though the pandemic had dampened his usually care-
free approach to dating and hook-ups. He was an expres-
sive and lively speaker, even over Zoom. “I’ve always been 
a promiscuous person,” he told me. “But the rising num-
ber of [COVID-19] cases is inversely related to promis-
cuity.” 


Before the pandemic, he had been meeting people, 
mostly casually, through dating apps like Grindr. He was 
largely unrestrained by the Yale bubble in his romantic 
exploits, having dated students from colleges all over the 
Greater New Haven area. He was—and still is—keeping 
his mind open to the possibility of a romantic spark, but it 
hasn’t happened yet. 


Back on campus for the year, he described feeling a 
newfound pressure to be more cautious when meeting up 
with matches. Will expressed a desire to adhere to public 
health precautions and consider the safety of his suitem-
ates and himself. His rule is now “Yalies only,” which he 
feels is less risky given the strict on-campus social distanc-
ing guidelines and twice weekly testing. 


Will’s willingness to explore beyond Yale was rare 
among students I spoke to for this article, and he has 
mourned giving up his usually open-minded approach to 
dating. Due to the pandemic, many have avoided meet-
ing new people, a mindset which Will characterized as 
“fearing the stranger.” Although he recognizes that it is 
a necessity for public health, it’s still a difficult thing to 
come to terms with. 
At the beginning of quarantine, Kayla*, a sophomore, 
explored options to recreate a campus experience online. 
She was invited to join a Discord server—an online chat-
ting platform that allows people to create private commu-
nities, or “servers”—for another university (which Kayla 
requested go unnamed to preserve anonymity). Discord

at Yale...But love is not at all put on pause; 
it’s found ways to flourish and shift in unan-
ticipated ways.”

began largely as a platform for gamers, but has grown, 
especially during the pandemic, to host a variety of com-
munities. Within a server, it’s possible to see which users 
are online and then initiate voice or video calls, which 
allows for spontaneous interactions. “It’s the closest you 
can get to running into someone on campus,” Kayla told 
me. We were speaking over FaceTime. Home for the 
semester, Kayla had been missing Yale.


This server had around a thousand members, most of 
them students at this university, and hosted virtual events. 
Kayla participated in an online dating competition that 
mimicked the style of the popular reality television show 
The Bachelor. The titular bachelor, a student on the 
server, picked between contestants as they vied for his 
attention through a series of virtual activities. Although 
Kayla didn’t win and the competition didn’t exactly go 
according to plan (the bachelor ended up bowing out of 
the dating aspect of the contest), her involvement won her 
some suitors. 


“A lot of people on the Discord platform tended to be 
sad, lonely gamer boys,” Kayla said, half-jokingly. She 
found herself the object of their affections and realized, 
somewhat incidentally, that these boys were willing and 
eager to send her small gifts. She would casually mention 
wanting a particular video game or craving something 
from Uber Eats, and someone would offer to order it for 
her. “It’s a symbiotic relationship.” 


None of these interactions, however, led to more 
long-term relationships, or even friendships. Most of the 
boys she spoke to over Discord lived across the country, 
and she never seriously considered dating someone she 
couldn’t easily meet in person. It was also difficult to 
develop an emotional connection with someone who was 
just “another face on Zoom.” 
Kira*, a sophomore, found that the forced distance 
away from Yale proved to be just the thing she needed 
to venture into her first committed relationship. She met 
her boyfriend on Bumble shortly after coming home for 
spring break. Kira surprised herself by agreeing to get 
coffee with him, a first date that lasted for seven hours. 
They went on a second date the next day — stargazing on 
the beach — right before lockdown was enacted and they 
decided to “move the entire relationship onto Zoom.” 


Kira attributed her relationship to the pandemic. She 
admitted that if Yale hadn’t shut down, she never would 
have given someone on Bumble real consideration. And 
somewhat counterintuitively, she told me that, “During 
COVID, I was more bold on dating apps and more willing 
to meet up with people.” 


Kira explained that, deprived of the wealth of romantic 
opportunities that being on campus offered, she began to 
take dating apps more seriously, especially at the begin-
ning of the pandemic in March. Once lockdown was 
enacted, she and her now-boyfriend became exclusive. 
Kira thought that distance from campus life helped her 
“reconsider all these expectations people had for [her],” 
including the pressure to have casual sex. In her experi-
ence at Yale, she felt that boys she met often wanted to 
have sex immediately and weren’t willing to commit to 
a relationship without first getting intimate. Because of 
the pandemic, she and her boyfriend were forced to take 
things slowly, something that Kira found refreshing. She 
attributes the strong foundation of their relationship to 
the long online period, which forced them to “slow down 
and become willing to commit.” 


For the fall semester, she plans to stay in her hometown, 
where her boyfriend also lives. But when Kira returns to 
Yale in the spring, she will have to weather a bicoastal, 
long-distance relationship. 
Emma*, a sophomore, met her girlfriend on a very 
unconventional platform — Librex, an anonymous dis-
cussion forum restricted to those with an Ivy League 
email address. At the beginning of lockdown, Emma 
posted in Librex’s general Ivy League thread asking, “Are 
there any queer women on here?” She received a variety 
of responses and matched with some commenters, which 
allowed her to direct message them. 


For Emma, who is politically conservative, it’s been 
difficult to navigate the queer dating scene at Yale. She 
told me, “When I posted [on Librex], I just wanted to find 
someone to talk to about being a queer woman. I wasn’t 
looking for a relationship.” 


But one commenter stood out. When Emma first spoke 
to her now-girlfriend, they were both anonymous users on 
Librex. They connected over a shared sense of loneliness 
at Yale, stemming from uncommon political opinions and 
not fitting into the student body. They also had similar 
professional and academic interests. 


They revealed their identities to each other after a day 
of talking on the app and moved into texting. At first, the 
conversation remained largely platonic, mostly focused 
on schoolwork and career goals. There was also the con-
