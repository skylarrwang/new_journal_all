The Politics 
of Preservation
Historical preservation and Yale’s continuous expansion 
can neglect voiceless, marginalized communities.

U
ntil just a few months ago, a 1948 art moderne 
bank stood at 80 Elm Street in downtown New 
Haven: a sparse stone monument to the cold simplicity 
of mid-twentieth century architecture. As the bank was 
torn down piece by piece in early 2020, the remnants 
of an Episcopal church built a century before were 
revealed and, likewise, demolished. Today, there is an 
empty lot. Plans for the construction of a Hilton Gar-
den Inn have halted due to COVID-19. 
The Yale tour groups ogling at campus buildings, 
admiring the statuaries on Harkness’ face, taking pic-
tures of the cathedral-like grandeur of Sterling—it’s a 
familiar sight for current students. But beyond Yale, the 
Elm City is perhaps even more remarkable for the his-
tory embodied in its structures and spaces. Consider that 
the sixteen  acres of the New Haven Green bordering 
Old Campus began in 1641 as a marketplace for Puri-
tan colonists. The John Cook House, on Elm Street, is 
one of the country’s oldest surviving stone structures. 
And New Haven’s Union Station was designed by the 
same architect who planned the U.S. Supreme Court 
building. Remnants of New Haven’s past linger in many 
of the buildings lining the streets of the Elm City, even 
as other aging edifices are threatened by degradation 
or new development. And tensions often arise between 
those who wish to preserve physical structures evocative 
of the past, those who make up existing communities 
that inhabit those places, and those who look to econo-
mize, modernize, and create spaces according to their 
own imaginings. 
Critics often condemn historic preservation for 
advocating unattainable and illogical standards, such 
as banning solar panels or dictating which sort of col-
umns should be allowed. In January 2020, Binyamin 
Appelbaum, a member of The New York Times edi-
torial board, wrote flatly that preservation “obstructs 
change for the better.” He was speaking specifically in 
the context of Washington, DC, but it is a sentiment 
many Americans would echo. In New Haven, although 
many of the best cases of preservation have been coop-
erative, a multiplicity of unequal voices can result in 
inequitable decision-making. There is no cohesive sys-
tem of checks and balances, no single method to ensure 
the democratization of either development or preserva-
tion, which can at times leave parties feeling ignored 
or unheard.
In New Haven alone, there are a total of twenty-seven 
historic districts. At Yale itself, however, there are rel-
atively few buildings on the National Register of His-
toric Places, the official list of buildings which require 
preservation for their historical significance. Most of 
them lie within the relatively small Hillhouse Historic 
District. Professor Alan Plattus, a scholar in the Yale 
School of Architecture, explained that the University 
has traditionally been opposed to placing more build-
ings on the register, due to the restrictions such a des-
ignation might impose. He said, “Yale is totally within 
their right” in their desire to keep their buildings off 
the register. When a building is registered or a historic 
district created, property owners have to approve the 
new designation. This is one of the challenges that an 
organization like the New Haven Preservation Trust 
(NHPT) seeks to address. A private non-profit organi-
zation dedicated to “preserving New Haven’s archi-
