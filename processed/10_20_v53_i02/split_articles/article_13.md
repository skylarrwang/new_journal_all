much,” she divulged with a sigh. “The first time I had 
it, I couldn’t get out of bed. It hurt that much.” 

Over a lunch of dumplings (mine), and chocolate 
milk (hers) in the cafeteria, she told me horror stories. 
She had worn white pants to school and heard snicker-
ing behind her in the hall before she realized her fatal 
mistake. Over the summer, she had snuck her bloodied 
bedsheets into the washer before her little brothers saw. 
She whispered the secrets of supposed womanhood to 
me—how much chocolate she’d eaten the night before, 
how much Advil she’d downed, and her first time trying 
out a tampon. My eyes grew wide with each parcel of 
new information I tucked into my pocket, until men-
struation morphed into a bloody monster, out to ravage 
my innards and turn me into a mass of vessels and flesh 
and pain. 

At home, my mama kept repeating the phrase to me. 
Baby palace. I stared at the small collection of pads we 
kept under the sink for my sister—overnight, winged, 
extra-long, daily, liners, tampons—like a buffet of cot-
ton and plastic and adhesive. It was coming for me, I 
thought. Watch out.

When it finally came, one day before the start of 
eighth grade, I was shocked at how anticlimactic it all 
was. I simply grabbed a pad from under the sink and 
went about my day as usual. But I knew it wouldn’t 
always be as simple as that. Decades, maybe even cen-
turies, of knowledge that my mama’s mama had passed 
onto her—an unbroken chain of wisdom—had now 
fallen onto me. 

My mama grew up in a stone-floored house in Tai-
chung, Taiwan with a blood-red-tiled bathroom that 
overlooked humid rice fields. As a child, she used 
to perch on a chair near the kitchen and watch her 
mama cook—congee, soy sauce marinated roasted 
tofu, tea-boiled eggs, and braised tofu skin, her favor-
ites. While inhaling the smells of her mama’s cooking, 
she absorbed everything she needed to know about the 
body beneath her fingertips—its simultaneous egg-
shell fragility and frightening resilience. All this, with-
out uttering a single scientific term. When her stom-
ach ached, her mama would massage the soft webby 
flesh between her thumb and index finger to relieve 
the pain, and bring her a cup of steaming ginger tea. 
When she succumbed to nausea and sweats from heat 
stroke, her mama would scrape a porcelain spoon down 
the back of her neck to release the boiling heat within 
her body. After showering, she religiously dried her 
short bobbed hair each night—wet hair invited in cold 
winds, or qi, the enemy personified when it comes to 
the baby palace. Every part of the body could be beau-
tified and cared for in some way—whether it was taking 
spoonfuls of sesame oil to make her boobs bigger or eat-
ing cold foods like grapefruit to cure breakouts. That 
way, my mama’s mama continued to care for her, even 
after she passed away when my mama was seventeen. 

To her, this wasn’t just Traditional Chinese Medi-
cine, or, in the colder, impersonal terms that American 
scholars use, TCM. This was just her way of balancing 
along with the precarity of being alive—of catering to 
both sides of nature, one fiery, hot, and flashy, and the 
other, cucumber-cold. Of holding hands with your own 
qi, or life spirit, instead of scolding it, rejecting it. Of 
living and breathing her mama’s memory.

Twenty-five years later, in a lavender-walled kitchen 
in Connecticut, my mama told me, aged eight, about 
the imbalance I harbored within me. Each winter, I’d 
fall victim to long, unquenchable bouts of asthma-in-
duced sinus infections—months of wet coughs and 
shortness of breath that forced me to carry around 
tissue boxes in my backpack, much to the delight of 
my friends. But, at the same time, I’d break out in 
hot flashes and flush easily, or get rashes on my skin. 
They’re both such strong forces within you, she said. 
The hot and cold qi. You’re just like your dad. We need 
to find a way to balance these within you, or you’ll 
always be like this.

So when my period made its appearance several 
years later, my mama brewed up a strong-smelling, 
maroon-hued herbal chicken soup, and watched care-
fully as I drank an entire bowlful. I might’ve pretended 
to make a face at the taste, but I secretly loved it—the 
woody bitterness of it, the impossibly dark hue. After I 
finished every drop of that broth, she introduced me to 
what I then saw as yellow-tape restrictions.


No jumping into bed or leaving the house with wet 
hair. No raw vegetables and fruits, specifically cucum-
bers, mung beans, oranges, and watermelons—save 
them for five days later. Green tea and ice cream are 
big no-nos. Lifting heavy objects, and heavy labor in 
general, should also be avoided at all costs. 

I stumbled upon each of these transgressions during 
my thirteenth year. One autumn night, I showered late, 
around ten o’clock. I crept into my room, trying to slip 
directly into my warm bed, my hair still dripping. But 
my mama was there, next to me, ushering me into the 
bathroom, where she blasted the hair dryer on full heat 
over my head for a full fifteen minutes. When I whined 
with exhaustion, she turned off the blow dryer and 
looked me directly in the eye with the badassery only 
mothers have. “You’ll regret it if you go to bed with wet 
hair.” After my cross country meet, I ran to the sink, 
parched and overheated, to inhale a glassful of cold 
water, which my mama promptly replaced with steam-
ing hot water straight from the kettle. I set the hot water 
down on the counter, claiming I’d rather die of thirst 
than drink something hot right now. On one of the hot-
test days of July, my best friend and I brought chocolate 
froyo from Costco, and I took one nervous bite of it. 
As a syrupy chocolate mouthful melted on my tongue, 
I felt an instinctual psychosomatic ache in my lower 
stomach, as if I’d committed a tiny rebellion against 
myself. I imagined my baby palace within me shrink-
ing, cracks forming in its magnificent pillars. Shudder-
ing, I handed the sticky container to my friend, who 
happily finished off the rest. 

The public enemies I listed above supposedly chip 
and wear away at the baby palace, just like acid rain on 
the sculpted marble face of a statue. The consequences 
involve irregular cycles, aching cramps, nausea, or 
even the eventual disappearance of your period—all 
foreboding, telltale signs that your qi is now working 
against you. 

One January morning of my junior year of high 
school, I walked to school with my friend in fifteen-de-
gree weather. The saliva froze on my tongue each time 
I opened my mouth to laugh. My friend’s dark curly 
brown hair was dripping wet from the shower, and 
froze to a crunch by the time we entered our school’s 
parking lot. Between my fingertips, the curls had solid-
ified. Before I could stop myself, I told her that she 
shouldn’t go out with wet hair. It’ll make your period 
cramps worse, I said. She looked at me straight in the 
eye with a hint of defiance and said, “Well, do you have 
scientific proof?”

We parted ways a little frostily that morning. 

A few years later, as a third-year student at Yale, I flit-
ted from one corner of campus to another in my over-
sized, secondhand beige jacket, warming my hands in 
my pockets. I felt myself mired in a freedom almost too 
loose to be true—like a pair of baggy tights that sagged 
in all the wrong places. In the dining hall, I could grab 
myself an entire plate of sliced raw cucumbers any 
time I wanted. I could even pour myself a brimming 
ice cold coke, and finish off my exceedingly cold meal 
with some ice cream. I could wash my hair at 2 a.m. 
and jump straight into bed after an exhausting night 
of pretending to listen to a boy rant passionately about 
his physics research. I could enjoy a cup of matcha tea 
in between my two seminars alone in my room, watch-
ing the steam rise, in this peaceful, tea-leaf-scented 
moment of rebellion. 

College, for many, is synonymous with freedom. 
Breaking free. But for me, I drew my own practice of 
my mama’s and her mama’s beliefs like a quilted throw 
blanket around me—a refuge from the chilling open 
air of being one small girl with a soft, low voice in an 
enormous college campus filled with go-getters and big 
talkers. 

The more I dried my hair after late-night showers, the 
more I drank hot cups of steaming water in the dining 
hall (I’ve survived endless strange looks from friends 
and strangers), the more I avoided the salad bar during 
my time of month, the more I danced the complicated 
dance with my own qi, the more my body thanked me. 
The more my mind and heart thanked me. 

For the first time in my life, I felt a warmth within 
me rising—a new strength, a new kick in my stride as 
I bounded down the stairs of Berkeley College North 
Court in my new white Fila sneakers. It’s hard to pin-
point exactly what made me feel suddenly so spirited, 
so healthy, so joyous. Was it the generations of knowl-
edge not just falling upon me, but also enveloping me? 
Taking me in? Or was it the warm, callused hand of 
the grandmother I’ve never met suddenly holding onto 
mine?
