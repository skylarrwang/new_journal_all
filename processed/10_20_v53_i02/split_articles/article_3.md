EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“A 
fifty-year embargo is inde-
fensible,” Victor Ashe ’67 pro-
claimed to me over the phone. You would think he 
was rehashing a debate over some obscure piece 
of legislation enacted during his tenure as U.S. 
Ambassador to Poland. But the septuagenarian was 
actually referring to rule 4.II.A of the Yale Corpo-
ration’s regulations: “Minutes of the Yale Corpora-
tion and its committees are closed for fifty years.” 

Over the course of their five annual meetings, 
the Corporation’s members—a potpourri of six-
teen corporate execs, venture capitalists, public 
officials, nonprofit directors, and academics—dis-
cuss and vote on high-level decisions regarding 
Yale’s budget, faculty leadership appointments, 
and large capital projects. Ashe is currently vying 
for a spot on the Corporation and running on a 
platform that emphasizes transparency. “I’m hop-
ing to convince my colleagues, if 
I’m elected, that they need to let the 
sun shine in,” he told me, his thick Ssouthern 
accent serving as a reminder of his past; he was the 
longest-serving mayor of Knoxville and a Tennes-
see state representative. 

To emphasize his point, Ashe offered up a joke: 
“What’s more secret than a senior society at Yale?” 
he asked me, followed by an excruciatingly awk-
ward pause. “The answer is the Yale Corporation.” 

Ashe’s campaign website outlines his stance more 
eloquently: “a more transparent and democratic 
Yale Corporation would strengthen the Univer-
sity’s decision-making ability, alumni/ae engage-
ment, and connection with all of its stakeholders, 
including students and faculty.” In both casual 
humor over the phone and prepared prose on his 
website, Ashe’s belief is clear: the Corporation’s 
50-year sealing of meeting minutes is excessive 
and a hindrance to progress. 

Ashe’s ambitions for openness will not be easily 
realized. To change Corporation bylaws, he will 
need to convince a supermajority of two-thirds 
of his colleagues to vote in favor of amending or 
overturning 4.II.A. His hurdle lies not only in the 
sheer number of trustees he’ll need to convince, 
but in the fact that the proposed changes buck the 
trend of a notoriously closed-off board composed 
of members who cherish this secrecy.

Catharine “Cappy” Bond Hill Ph.D ‘57, an 
economist, director of an education non-profit, 
and a senior trustee on the Corporation, thinks 
the fifty 50-year policy is vital. Sealing rules, she 
said, is are “a way of helping people who are on 
any board speak honestly and forthrightly and not 
worry about it entering the public domain at some 
point and coming back and haunting them.” All of 
Hill’s institutional affiliations—as a current Yale-
NUS board member, and previously as the pres-
ident at Vassar College and provost of Williams 
College—had some version of long-term minute 
sealing, between thirty 30 and fifty 50 years; this is 
a common practice at private universities. 

Before even beginning to reach out to Corpora-
tion members—a time-consuming, secretary-rid-
den process, given that Yale doesn’t list any emails 
or phone numbers for any of the trustees—I antic-
ipated Hill’s answer to my question of why Yale’s 
minutes are sealed for half a century. After a 2017 
push from students to make the Corporation’s dis-
cussions more open, Peter Salovey offered a fac-
simile of her statement, explaining in a Yale Daily 
News DN interview that “a certain level of confi-
dentiality and protection from short-term consid-
erations is necessary to allow [trustees] to do their 
work.” Ostensibly to placate student complaints at 
this time, specifically with regard to discussions 
around building renaming, the board unveiled a 
few transparency measures, such as listing meet-
ing times online and encouraging meetings with 
student groups. But many felt these changes were 
worthless and “largely cosmetic,” according to the 
News YDN. 

To 
emphasize 
the 
openness-effectiveness 
tradeoff, Hill suggested I look into how public 
boards function. “Often what happens there is 
essentially nothing,” she told me with a chuckle. 
She added that these boards gather an array of tal-
ented and committed people, and when there is 
pressure from the public record to censor oneself, 
“decisions and conversations get pushed some-
place else, which I think is really unfortunate.” 

The debate about whose voices should play a 
larger role in a board’s decision making process—
those of a small, chosen group of individuals, or 
those of the students, faculty and greater university 
community—is at the heart of the disagreement 
between Ashe and Hill.

However, the origins of Yale’s decision to seal 
meeting minutes comes from a much less ratio-
nal place. Ex-university secretary Sam Chauncey 
’57 told me that the rule’s hasty adoption, which 
came sometime between 1979 and 1982, accord-
ing to the university archivist, was based largely 
on administrators’ personal fears rather than sound 
reasoning. Chauncey explained that when he 
became university secretary in 1971 under presi-
dent Kingman Brewster, Yale Corporation records 
were publicly accessible after a shorter time of fif-
teen years post-meeting. But after A. Bartlett Gia-
matti became president in 1978, the heavy wooden 
doors of Woodbridge Hall slammed shut.

“Bart had been a beloved faculty member,” 
Chauncey said, admired by students and profes-
sors alike. But when he became president, finan-
cial troubles necessitated Giamatti cut the univer-
sity’s budget. “Many of his faculty friends turned 
on him and he became excessively sensitive… he 
had very thin skin.” 

Giamatti’s assistant, Henry Broude, had intense 
paranoia of his own. According to Chauncey, 
whose sister was Broude’s secretary, Broude would 
burn messages left on his desk at the end of the 
day and never let his own handwriting be seen. 
Chauncey surmised that Broude’s behavior aug-
mented Giamatti’s worries, eventually pushing the 
president to such an intense state of paranoia that 
he requested to be driven around campus accom-
panied by armed guards. The biggest outcome of 
this anxiety, though, was Giamatti’s decision to 
extend the fifteen-year-rule to fifty years, according 
to Chauncey. We’ll have to take his word for it—
he wrote me in an email, “I am afraid anyone I can 
think of who could comment on Bart’s paranoia is 
dead.”

“Paranoia is not a rational reason to adopt any 
policy,” Ashe said, reacting to the story about Gia-
matti, which Chauncey had recounted to him on a 
previous occasion. “What happened is all the more 
reason to change it.” Hill, on the other hand, doesn’t 
think that the motivations behind the creation of the 
fifty 50-year -seal impact the rule’s efficacy. 

In a 2006 report on openness in public university 
administration published in The Journal of Higher 
Education, the authors reiterate Hill’s claims, writ-
ing that transparency mandates, often referred to as 
sunshine laws, can cause board members to become 
“reluctant to discuss controversial issues” in the set-
ting of a full and open board, with individual conver-
sations happening instead. However, they conclude 
that, “though sometimes these laws are perceived as 
time-consuming and a hindrance to quick action, we 
detected substantial consensus in the belief that, on 
average, the benefits of mandated openness,” namely 
as increased democracy of a board and accountabil-
ity of its members “outweigh the costs.” A 2017 brief 
from the Association of Governing Boards of Univer-
sities and Colleges echoes this, conceding that open 
boards may be inefficient but “voice is to be valued 
in all democratic settings, and one could argue that 
it is especially needed in the current landscape of 
higher education.”

Maggie Thomas YSE’15, who is on the May 2021 
ballot alongside Ashe for a Corporation seat, also 
embraces the value of voice, and has championed 
transparency as an important step towards the uni-
versity’s fight against climate change. Thomas, who 
served as Elizabeth Warren’s climate policy advisor 
during the 2020 democratic primary, is running via 
the Yale Forward campaign, a joint effort with the 
Cambridge-based group Harvard Forward to elect 
climate advocates to the Ivy League juggernauts’ 
respective governing bodies.

An email from Thomas’s campaign expressed dis-
taste for the Corporation’s secrecy, writing that “the 
Yale Corporation’s 50 year embargo on its meet-
ing minutes is nothing short of shameful, and Yale 
alumni deserve better.” She specifically cites the 
Corporation’s 2014 decision to remain invested in 
fossil fuels. When a vote was held on this issue at the 
time, two Corporation members, one of whom oxy-
moronically sat on the Committee for Investor Rela-
tions, held high-profile positions in the fossil fuel 
industry, including board seats at Anadarko Petro-
leum and Exelon, two multibillion-dollar multi-bil-
lion dollar energy companies. “It will not be until 
2064 that we will learn whether Yale’s own trustees 
chose to put a finger on the scale when the outcome 
could have directly affected their personal or pro-
fessional financial interests,” wrote Thomas. The 
half-century delay is particularly frightening when 
considering the immediate and near-future effects 
of climate change from fossil fuels—  environmen-
tal experts predict twenty inches of sea level rise in 
coastal Connecticut by 2050.

A large part of Thomas’s campaign is predicated on 
accessibility within the Corporation, beyond simply 
opening minutes—she dedicates an entire section of 
her website to “Inclusive Governance,” providing a 
scrupulous thirteen-page document which explains 
the benefits of open governance and the steps 
needed to achieve it. In addition to making meet-
ing minutes more readily available to the public, she 
believes the Corporation needs to eliminate barri-
ers to entry for young alumni by reducing petition 
requirements to appear on the ballot and providing 
ample opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to 
share their perspectives with Corporation members. 
Many of these additional objectives are also reflected 
in Ashe’s platform.

But with respect to the planet, Thomas breaks 
from Ashe, who never mentioned fossil fuel divest-
ment or climate change issues in our original phone 
interview or on his campaign website. Though 
focused mainly on environmental change, Thomas 
“If the minutes are opened by the time I 
have grandkids, what does it matter what the 
Yale Corporation talked about this year? At 
that point, you might as well seal them for-
ever.”
