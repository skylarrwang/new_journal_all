Along the main drag in East Haven, Connecticut, five 
miles out of range of Harkness Tower’s carillon, is 
what may be the largest American flag known to man, its 
wingspan so officious that, looking at it from below, you 
might easily take it for the sky itself. Further down the road 
is a sign for the local Hobby Lobby and directly above it 
another that says, “Big Lots,” the ‘L’ rubbed away by rain, 
likely the work of a hurricane with a keen eye for satire, if 
not subtlety. And further still, where small town turns to 
tree cover, is a yard sign with the words: “Saint Augustine: 
Next Left.” This does seem like a place where you might 
come to confess––something dark or something lovely, 
really anything at all––with the woods as your witness. 
I wasn’t here to confess but to find what I thought 
were the grounds of an ignominious and odd battle in 
the region’s colonial history. In early August, while look-
ing for ten-dollar Loeb Classical editions at Whitlock’s 
Book Barn, a farmhouse turned used bookstore in Beth-
any, CT, I came across a local history with a title too 
muscular to miss: The Republic of New Haven: A His-
tory of Municipal Evolution by Charles Herbert Lever-more. The book looked ancient and I opened it slowly. 
Having skimmed the table of contents, I flipped to a 
section titled “The Quarrel with East Haven,” expecting 
a kind of civil war in miniature. What I found instead 
was a petty town squabble involving the Governor of the 
Connecticut Colony and a gaggle of geese. At the turn 
of the 18th century, somewhere in the Puritan wilder-
ness, the Governor of Connecticut was unleashing an 
Antietam on the local waterfowl.


The people of East Haven indulged their geese, let-
ting them waddle through town like princelings on 
the grounds of an Old Regime château. No farm was 
spared––not even Governor Gurdon Saltonstall’s. The 
Governor, “vexed with this invasion of his rights,” 
according to Levermore, “proclaimed a defensive war, 
attacked and routed the feathered army, making a great 
slaughter among them.”   


In the next election, not a single vote was cast for 
Governor Saltonstall in East Haven. In retaliation, 
Saltonstall revoked the town’s newly won independence 
and it was resorbed into New Haven proper.   


The story ended there, and I found nothing more 
when I researched the skirmish online. I began to sus-
pect it was all apocryphal, nothing more than a libel 
or a legend gone stale. So, to settle the issue, I steeled 
myself to cold call the patrician scions of the Salton-
stall family and contacted the estate, now a “super pre-
mium” olive oil purveyor in Petaluma, CA. The voice 
that answered the phone didn’t ring with the haughty 
timbre of old Atlantic merchants, but was gentle and 
sweet-toned. The conversation ranged over a thousand 
years of family lore, meandering with the contour of a 
gooseneck river––yet no mention of the geese or their 
massacre. 


The last chance at clarity was in the colonial records. 
They told a bloodless story. What I had thought was 
a madman’s little civil war was only the Governor of 
Connecticut madly scattering geese from his lawn. No 
matter how often he tried to eject them from the grass, 
the geese returned. 


I paid a visit to the burned-out foundation of Gov-
ernor Saltonstall’s farm on the east edge of Furnace 
Lake in East Haven. Perhaps centuries ago Old Light 
preachers howled jeremiads there and Paul Bunyan 
types felled trees. But that day the leaves were crimson 
and it was peaceful.   


The following week, I was reading The New York 
Times online when I noticed a new species of adver-
tisement pop up at the top of the page: goose control. 
My weeks of digging through internet archives for the 
faintest honk of the geese of East Haven had led Google 
to suspect I had a problem and inferred I needed a prod 
to handle it. Another week went by and the ads didn’t 
stop. Soon I was inundated with them––a gaggle nesting 
on my digital lawn. 


I couldn’t help myself. I clicked on one, an ad for 
Geese Peace, Inc., one of many companies that service 
the New Haven area. The company promised to address 
the goose problem “humanely and without contro-
versy,” elaborating with words grave enough to begin a 
manifesto: “Canada geese and other wildlife live within 
or at the fringe of our landscapes and communities plac-
ing them in conflict with us.” The campaign the Gover-
nor had taken up centuries earlier was evidently still in 
progress and with its share of partisans. 


As is often the case in partisan conflicts, the etiol-
ogy of the problem is ignored and all that’s left are its 
symptoms. This one began when, in the 19th century, 
market hunters invented a cruel technique to capture 
wild migratory geese and harvest them for their down. 
The hunters would catch a few dozen geese, clip their 
feathers to prevent them from flying away, and release 
them on a lake. Dozens of other migratory flocks would 
then land on the water, seduced by the appearance of 
safety. Once the lake was full, the market hunters would 
blast it with rifle fire. The geese would take off and the 
sky would become so crowded that day turned to night. 
Anywhere the hunters aimed they struck a bird. For a 
moment, every hunter had the skill of Apollo. 


For a century, this was the norm. Over and over, the 
practice proved its efficacy and the Canada goose was 
systematically destroyed. But as conservation came to 
be a fixture of American politics, the Canada goose 
found an unlikely ally in the federal government. The 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act, passed by Congress in 1918, 
prohibited the slaughter and trade of migratory birds 
without a license from the Fish and Wildlife Service 
and mandated that market hunters release their cap-
tured stock. The geese they were releasing, however, 
had been bred in captivity, had their wings clipped, and 
couldn’t migrate. Their biology broken, they became 
“residents.”


Humans forced geese to live contrary to their nature. 
But nature was already being remade in a way that coin-
cidentally suited the geese. According to the Cornell 
Ornithology Lab, “as lawns started to proliferate, many 
of these resident geese flocks began to thrive and expand 
their range.” The suburbs, with their manicured grass, 
man-made lakes, athletic fields, and golf courses, cre-
ated the perfect conditions for geese––plenty of nutri-
ents, open space, and no natural predators to evade. 
Over a 40-year period, the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture recorded roughly a doubling in the population of 
migratory geese in North America––from 1,000,000 in 
1970 to 1,840,000 in 2012. In contrast, during the same 
period, the resident goose population increased nearly 
15-fold––from 250,000 to 3,850,000––eclipsing the 
migratory population. In Connecticut alone, between 
1950 and 2009, the overall goose population increased 
from fewer than 500 to over 52,000. If hubris begets 
nemesis, humans have gotten theirs.   


A few geese here and there are unlikely to ruffle 
feathers. But the fantasy of suburbia––of nature pris-
tine, tidy, and subjugated––doesn’t comport well with 
thousands of geese roaming free, carving out their own 
territory, leaving turdulent gifts in their wake. Subur-
banites’ main concern is geese’s propensity for the 
excremental act. In a day, a single goose will deposit up 
to two pounds of turd––14 percent of its body weight. 
The 50,000 geese in Connecticut, in a week, will pro-
duce 350 tons of turd, or, for scale, the weight of two 
blue whales. In 2018, the mayor’s office in Milford, CT, 
received “more feedback about goose poop than just 
about any other matter of city business.” 


The problem extends beyond despoiled soccer fields. 
Contamination of watersheds and lakes from Canada 
goose feces is well-documented. Some strains of bac-
teria in samples of goose feces, when hit with a host 
of antibiotics, showed resistance. Backyards, lawns, and 
playgrounds ridden with droppings pose a health risk to 
small children.


Canada geese are “a social problem,” Min Huang, 
a wildlife biologist at Connecticut’s Department of 
Energy and Environmental Protection, told me. “The 
state’s implemented liberal hunting seasons in Septem-
ber, January, and February to reduce the numbers,” he 
said. “There’s been legislation on the books since 2002, 
allowing for goose round-ups. Not a single town has 
taken advantage of it to avoid the controversy. They’re 
spending money on harassing the birds and putting up 
effigies.” Mr. Huang added that the Yale golf course was 
a perfect example of the effigy approach gone awry––in 
the past, there were coyote decoys on the grounds, but 
the geese quickly became habituated to them and used 
them for shade. Scott Ramsay, who was superintendent 
of the golf course for 17 years and left the position this 
past September, kept a goose dog to haze any resident 
birds and establish the area as a predator’s domain. But 
about four years ago the geese overran the grounds, 
says Peter Palacios Jr., the new general manager of the 
course. Matt Golino, the master gardener, was forced 
to call in a goose mitigator to deal with the problem. 
It seems to have proven effective: the grounds haven’t 
seen many geese of late.   


A whole industry has grown up in the shade of coy-
ote decoys. Among the local specialists, there’s Geese 
Peace, Geese Relief, No Geese Today, Connecticut 
Goose Solutions, Wild Goose Chase New England, 
and The Gooseman Cometh. Goose mitigation strat-
egies include an arsenal of devices that could arm a 
small militia: chemical agent repellants, pyrotechnics 
and propane cannons, lasers, plastic-coated kevlar grid 
lines, mylar tape, automatic exploding cannons, motion 
sprinklers, barrier fencing, and trained goose dogs. 
Harassment by dog is the industry standard, and the 
standard dog is the border collie. Geese Relief’s Chris 
Santopietro told me that the bias for the breed can be 
attributed to its instinct to “herd, not hurt.” Santopi-
etro uses traditional sheepherding commands to direct 
the dogs, first having them stare the geese down. “The 
stare mesmerizes the geese and they start to move,” he 
said––they retreat but don’t leave. Then the dogs set off 
in pursuit. With repetition, the geese eventually capit-
ulate, coming to accept that the area isn’t theirs, and 
they move on. 


One morning in October, I accompanied Santopietro 
on a chase at a cemetery in New Canaan, CT. We met 
at the entrance––two huge stone pillars and swinging 
metal gates, worn from many passages to and fro. We 
were headed for the lake at the heart of the cemetery. 
A flock of geese had set up on its banks and when we 
arrived on the scene, I understood why. The place was a 
goose’s paradise––expansive fields to graze, a pond full 
of shoots and stems, a forbidden feast for the taking. 
Seeing us, the geese inched toward the water. San-
topietro took a few minutes to survey the flock’s move-
ments to make sure it had no injured members in its 
midst. His dogs typically don’t touch the geese, but 
there’s always the chance that an injured or sick bird, 
slow to flee, might get caught in the heat of herding. 
Satisfied that the flock was healthy, Santopietro opened 
the back of his truck and unlatched a dog crate. Out 
bounded Chip, a black and white border collie with a 
rough coat and an intensity that could cut diamond. 
Immediately the geese flew to the lake, all the while 
honking and hrinking, the female goose’s call. San-
topietro barked the sheepherding commands––“Lay 
down, Chip!” meaning “get low to the ground and slow 
down”––and the operation began. Chip approached 
the lake on a crawl, one deliberate paw at a time, lock-
ing eyes with the flock. Santopietro called out the next
