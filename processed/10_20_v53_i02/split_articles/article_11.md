This year, Dixon only worked from home for 
about six days. The rest of the time, even in March 
and April at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic 
in Connecticut, Dixon was in his office or in the 
parks. “No one was here anyways,” he said. “When 
the weather gets warm, people want to be in the 
parks.”


COVID-19 complicated the restructuring of the 
parks management system, as emergency manage-
ment became the city’s top priority. By the sum-
mer, however, parks had become crucial as people 
coped with isolation and spent more time outdoors. 
According to Rebecca Bombero, Deputy Chief 
Administrative Officer for the City of New Haven, 
parks had a “huge increase in usage” that began 
as early as March. The city closed Farnham Drive 
and English Drive to cars in order to accommodate 
pedestrian congestion in East Rock Park and give 
people more room to spread out. They also began 
issuing permits for people to use certain fields 
across the city. To get the permit, however, “peo-
ple need to have a COVID plan,” Dixon said. “And 
they need to stick to that plan, particularly if it’s a 
large group.”


Across the country, the pandemic has highlighted 
the need for public spaces, especially parks. The 
Project for Public Spaces, a New York-based non-
profit that consults on the design and planning of 
public spaces, has been working since the 1970s to 
make communal spaces more accessible and inno-
vative. “I’m thinking about mental health, for exam-
ple,” said Priti Patel, the nonprofit’s Senior Project 
Manager. “During this time of isolation with every-
body fearful and scared to leave their house, public 
spaces have been able to provide some sort of men-
tal escape or mental health opportunity.”


Yale students, as well, have made more use of the 
parks this school year since returning to campus. 
Yale Outdoors, which usually leads camping and 
hiking trips outside of the city, has frequented East 
and West Rock to take in sunsets and hike beneath 
the bright orange trees. 


The increase in park usage, however, coupled 
with underfunding and behavior such as littering 
and graffiti, continues to put strain on the newly 
formed Department of Parks and Public Works. 
“As with most sectors of city government, unfortu-
nately, there’s never enough resources to do every-
thing you want to do,” said Bombero. As a result, 
the city relies heavily on volunteer and private orga-
nizations, such as the Friends of Edgewood Park, 
to plant new trees, maintain gardens, and push for 
new projects. 


Edgewood Park sits between West River Memo-
rial Park to the south and West Rock to the north. 
Entering from Edgewood Avenue, a steep road 
leads down to the duck pond, where people bring 
their own boats to canoe or kayak. By the pond, 
don’t expect much company apart from the birds. A 
walkway surrounded by dense bushes leads around 
the edge and under a bridge. 


The Friends of Edgewood Park organizes many 
different programs and groups that lead efforts to 
maintain and beautify the park, including man-
aging gardens, clearing trails, and planting trees. 
Every fall, they also teach community members 
how to tap the maple trees for sap, and one mem-
ber explains how to process it. The organization 
has existed for over one hundred years and was cre-
ated originally to supplement the work of the Parks 
Department. “The Parks Department, they don’t 
have the capacity to do a lot more than to take down 
huge trees and to mow and to pick up trash twice a 
week,” said Stephanie Fitzgerald, a ten-year mem-
ber of Friends of Edgewood Park. “They can’t take 
care of gardens. So we fill in that part.”


Each end of the long and narrow park features 
ponds, playgrounds, and a skate park. A pedestrian 
path cuts through the center underneath a canopy 
of trees. Since the two ends of the park are almost 
a mile apart, however, Fitzgerald said at times they 
can feel disconnected. So the group is planting 
trees and a garden in the center with the “vision 
that people will come together … and really get to 
know one another.”


The Urban Resources Initiative (URI), a non-
profit partnered with the Yale School of the Envi-
ronment, also works closely with the City of New 
Haven to promote green areas throughout the city. 
The group began working in New Haven in 2007, 
and has since planted over 9,000 trees throughout 
the city. “There are so many different benefits of 
trees,” said Anna Pickett, Development and Out-
reach Director at the Urban Resources Initiative. 
“But no one understands the need for 
parks more than the communities they 
belong to.”

Trees of course provide shade and reduce carbon 
dioxide in the air, but Pickett also pointed out lesser 
known benefits of trees such as filtering out soil pol-
lutants and flood reduction.


Through URI, citizens of New Haven can request 
a tree for their neighborhood. The group delivers 
and plants the tree, and the citizens are expected to 
water and maintain it. “The people who live near 
the trees are committed to caring for them,” said 
Pickett. “There’s some ownership, there’s a relation-
ship they have with their tree that helps keep them 
alive. And our survival rates are higher because of 
that.” Despite the work of the community, however, 
it’s still hard to maintain trees. URI helps to plant 
around 500 trees in the city every year, just enough 
to replace the ones lost to disease or old age. 
	

Overall, there are around 30,000 street 
trees in New Haven, and many more in the parks, 
although those have never been officially surveyed. 
The Urban Resources Initiative compiled a map 
measuring New Haven’s urban tree canopy in 2010, 
and released an updated version in 2016. Accord-
ing to the Urban Resources Initiative, the urban 
tree canopy is the “layer of leaves, branches, and 
stems of trees that cover the ground when viewed 
from above.” Unsurprisingly, West Rock and its 
surrounding area has the most tree cover of any 
neighborhood in New Haven, followed closely by 
Westville and Fair Haven Heights. 
	

The aesthetic value of trees is apparent 
— especially in the New Haven fall — but, as 
Pickett said, they’re much more than eye candy. A 
study by Austin Troy, J. Morgan Grove, and Jarlath 
O’Neil-Dunne published in 2012 linked a 10 per-
cent increase in tree canopy cover to a 12 percent 
decrease in crime in Baltimore. The research is far 
from conclusive, but the point stands — trees are 
indispensable. Parks are indispensable. With New 
Haven and the rest of the country reeling from the 
pandemic, this is when we need green space the 
most. 


Since the restructuring of the Parks Department, 
the city government appears to still be catching 
up to the change — according to the city website, 
the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Trees 
still exists. But the parks aren’t going anywhere. 
The community groups who watch over them con-
tinue to pick up trash and clear trails, even during 
the pandemic. The park rangers, with extra time 
on their hands because of cancelled programs, 
recently removed five trees from the West River, 
which runs through Edgewood Park, to clear the 
way for kayaks.


But no one understands the need for parks more 
than the communities they belong to. Volunteer 
groups, dedicated civil servants, and the goats who 
munch on knotweed are looking out for the New 
Haven. Amidst future budget turmoil and an ongo-
ing pandemic, the parks will have many people in 
their corner.
