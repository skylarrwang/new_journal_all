The Elmhurst

I 
live in a first-floor apartment in New Haven, Connecticut. 
Our living room looks onto Elm Street, just east of its inter-
section with Howe. This is the Elmhurst.
	
A mix of businesses and apartments surround us. 
Jane Jacobs would be proud. Our eastern neighbor is the 
Coop, which advertises on Craigslist and mandates 75% 
consensus for accepting new members. It houses at least 
one talented trombonist, an elderly man who enjoys read-
ing on the front steps, and a skinny woman with a relaxed 
smile who smokes cigarettes (my roommate and I like to 
imagine she is our elder queer icon). More non-student 
“real people” live across the street at 364. Our landlord 
owns another, nicer building at 366. Their residents, like 
us, are mostly undergraduates. I once visited 366 to kill a 
friend’s spider. It looked like the dorms I used to live in. 
West of 366 is Three Sheets, perhaps the only bar in New 
Haven that stayed open during the pandemic, courtesy 
of its outdoor patio. West of Three Sheets—Main Gar-
den, a cheap Chinese restaurant with apartments on top; 
I bought a skateboard off Facebook from one resident. 
Across from Main Garden is Alpha Delta Pizza. They stay 
open until 3 AM all week. Zach’s, a homey liquor store, is 
on the corner.
	
That’s just the microneighborhood. Further west, 
more single family homes and townhouses pepper the 
road to Stop and Shop; the road passes at least one funeral 
home and a behavioral health center. Further east, and 
the university begins to dominate. The Bank of America 
parking lot attracts skittish white kids buying weed. A 
large Episcopalian church shields us from the Broadway 
shopping district. A few fraternity houses sit across from it.
	
Only one of our front windows has a screen. I like 
to sit in the other and watch. Especially when the sun is 
overhead in the late morning, I like to slouch against the 
frame and let one leg dangle out. One time an older man 
walked up and tried to ask me out for a drink, but I am 
mostly left alone. I never feel unsafe. I like to watch the 
staff open Three Sheets. 
	
When I finish my rice or tea and biscuit, I leave the 
window. The sound remains hard to ignore. Our stretch 
of Elm Street is a two-way parade on an otherwise mostly 
one-way street: pedestrians, dirt bikes, motorcycles, what 
can only be described as electric tricycles, skateboards, 
commuting and recreational bicycles (kids do wheelies 
on the latter), obnoxious “peddle pubs,” and variously lux-
urious or decrepit cars screech or slide by at all hours of 
the day and night. One vaguely cursed-looking, washed-
out ice cream truck parks outside Alpha Delta and never 
seems to be open. It looks so clearly like a drug front that 
it probably isn’t. City officials have tried for years to pros-
ecute the dirt bikers they claim “terrorize” residents with 
reckless stunt driving. Call-in complaints have helped var-
ious sting operations. A new ordinance would increase the 
fine from $99 to $2000.
	
Last night, somebody threw purple Downy deter-
gent out an Elmhurst window. The thumping bass of a 
small but exuberant party kept other building residents up 
until one or two. A homeless, alcoholic man who often sits 
on our front steps was arrested. I haven’t seen him since. 
A Coop denizen who maintains the front garden swept 
up some glass, but a purple stain remains. It is thick and 
sticky, almost gelatinous.
