TOADS  IS  CLOSED
Wednesday nights at Toad’s are silent for the near 
future, but Yalies’ memories are still vibrant.

A
t about 9:45 PM on a Wednesday night, you can find 
Pierce Daly ‘23.5 scouring the depths of Bass Library. 
And no, it’s not because he can’t figure out the last ques-
tion on his econ problem set due tomorrow morning (well, 
maybe he should focus on his pset). Daly, procrastinating 
whatever homework is still on his docket, strolls around 
the library in search of Yalies craving a midweek adven-
ture.


A Toad’s Place aficionado since his first Wednes-
day at Yale, Daly considers himself a “Woad’s (that is, 
W-ednesday T-oad’s) loyalist.” And Daly is the perfect 
candidate for the Woad’s Scholarship (a title bestowed 
upon Yalies who attend every Woad’s dance party of 
the school year). A social butterfly, Daly is a household 
name among the Class of 2023. “I’m the only one of 
my  friends who makes an effort to go every week,” Daly 
said.


As soon as his last Wednesday class ends, Daly begins 
plotting his adventure. Ready to cash in nights under 
Bass’ fluorescent lights for Toad’s glistening disco ball, 
Daly begs his friends to put down their pencils, shove 
their dying computers into their stuffed backpacks, and 
make a beeline for the always reliable Farnam pregame. 
After scouting the ideal group, usually composed of a 
few friends and a handful of randos, Daly emerges from 
Sterling’s main entrance — crew by his side, homework 
on the brink of completion. Infatuated by the thrill of 
post-Toad’s 2 AM homework sprees in a stupor, Daly 
walks down York St. with a new group of Woad’s hope-
fuls every Wednesday night. 


Nothing can deter Daly from making the trek to 
Woad’s. In sickness and in health, Daly once vowed to 
attend every Wednesday dance party — even when mid-
terms loom large. “I’ll do my best to drum up some busi-
ness if I’m really hankering to go,” Daly said, laughing. 
When Daly approaches the bouncers at the door, 
he’s hoping for a night “busy enough that [he’s] always 
meeting new people but empty enough to prevent suf-
focation.”


But now, 81 miles away from York St, Daly reflects on 
what once was — his Wednesday night routine shared 
with Yalies yearning for a serendipitous break in the 
workweek. In a country forever changed by nearly nine 
million COVID-19 infections, nights standing shoul-
der-to-shoulder with fellow Yalies on Toad’s stage feel 
worlds away.


“Toad’s is shut down like a damn morgue,” Toad’s 
Place owner Brian Phelps said.


COVID-19 has decimated small businesses across 
the country. As of August, 163,735 U.S. businesses have 
closed their doors, and Connecticut’s small businesses 
are lobbying for $70 million in grants. According to 
Moody’s/CNN’s Back-to-Normal Index, Connecticut’s 
economy is currently operating at 88 percent of what it 
was prior to the COVID-19 lockdown, which began in 
mid-March. But the reality on the ground — a board-
ed-up Toad’s and a deserted York St. — feels apocalyp-
tic.
