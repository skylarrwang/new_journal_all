“Birds get drunk on blueberries,” Guy Beardsley says. 
We’re idling on his John Deere Gator next to a row 
of scarlet-colored blueberry bushes. It’s a warm Octo-
ber morning in 2019, humid enough that dew still clings 
to the blueberry leaves in spite of the heat. The image of 
drunken birds makes me laugh, but Guy’s matter-of-fact. 
“We cover the blueberries up with bird netting, because 
otherwise the birds really do become inebriated,” he says, 
cornflower eyes peering at me over his glasses. His voice is 
gravelly and warm, like a 1920s radio announcer coming in 
through the static.

If anyone knows about blueberries and birds, it’s Guy 
Beardsley, who has been an organic farmer in Shelton, 
Connecticut, for almost thirty years. He can tell you 
why white clover is superior to pink clover (it puts nitro-
gen back into the soil and the bees love it), why corn 
silk is vital to an ear of corn (it pollinates each kernel), 
and why cows shouldn’t eat too many apples (like birds, 
the sugar overwhelms their fiber-inclined systems and 
they get drunk).

Guy is the only 90-year-old I’d bet could beat me in 
an arm-wrestling match, mostly because he still splits 
his own firewood in the winter. He can also tell you 
exactly what the planting season weather was like two 
years ago. The only sign he’s in his nineties are his tur-
nip-shaped knuckles, swollen from years of weeding. He 
has wrinkles that only a kind person could have—crin-
kles around his eyes from smiling and forehead ridges 
from raising his eyebrows when he tells the best part of 
a story.

He’s so kind that he didn’t even question a stranger 
like me calling last fall to ask if he would spend three 
months teaching her about farming. My grandfather 
was a rancher in northern Nevada, so I knew about 
working with animals, but I didn’t know the first thing 
about working with soil. I wanted to learn. He agreed to 
help me without skipping a beat. “So when ya coming 
by?” he asked.

Twelve miles west of New Haven, the signs along 
Route 34 become handmade. By the time you pass 
Maltby Lakes, glossy billboards for personal injury attor-
neys surrender to hand-painted ads for milk and hay. 
The space between houses begins to widen so that by 
the time you reach the town of Shelton, the trees appear 
to outnumber the people. Brick smokestacks along the 
Housatonic River add an early industrial grit to what 
otherwise would be another quaint Connecticut town. 
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, 
Shelton’s factories made everything from razor strops 
to bicycle forgings. These days, the main relic of the 
town’s industrial past is the WIFFLE ball headquarters 
on the edge of town.

Guy’s Eco-Garden (or “the farm” as the family calls 
it) is technically located in White Hills, four miles north 
of the former industrial hub. This is the most rural part 
of Shelton, where rabbits aren’t afraid of people and 
poison ivy climbs the trunks of fall-colored trees.

Sometime between its construction in 1749 and 
now, Guy’s house learned to relax. Its right angles 
have softened with age. In the summer, the boards 
swell up with humidity, but come November, they 
contract in the dry winter air. This back and forth has 
left the farmhouse with a charming, slightly bloated 
silhouette. Guy grew up here, and so did his father 
and grandfather. His great-grandfather, a man “as 
wide as he was tall,” bought the property in 1849.

Guy’s main patch of land is the four-acre lot 
around his farmhouse. It hosts: a bakery, a vineyard, a 
lavender patch, thirteen turkeys, a tractor-sized com-
post pile, Brussels sprouts (“The English eat them 
for breakfast, but that’s sort of a stretch,” Guy says), 
blackberries, elderberries, okra, five types of kale, a 
hoop-house, a greenhouse, a drying house for the gar-
lic, a sign marking the “Chapel of Saint James of the 
White Hills” that his son-in-law planned (but never 
managed) to build, a fleet of barking Chihuahuas that 
surround visitors like angry flagella, and a fridge con-
taining exclusively clams.

To one of the barn swallows flying overhead, Guy’s 
farm probably looks like nothing more than a green 
blip between his brother’s brown cider mill and red 
apple orchard. The farm is bordered at the front by 
Route 110, and in the back, by a row of McMansions 
with family names embossed on their stone veneer 
siding in Edwardian Script. All of it—Route 110, the 
McMansions, even the apple orchards—was hayfields 
for most of Guy’s life.

Guy was born five miles away from the farm at Grif-
fin Hospital in October of 1930. He was a child of the 
Depression, when the farm’s philosophy was “use it 
up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.” Socks were 
darned, holes were patched, and nothing was wasted. 
Guy still can’t bring himself to waste much now. He 
won’t even compost scapes, the bright green, spaghet-
ti-shaped shoots that grow out of the tops of his garlic 
plants. He grinds them into garlic scape pesto instead.

Guy grew up in a pre-automated world, when 
horses, not tractors, drew plows and Model T pick-ups 
had hand cranks. He went to a one-room schoolhouse 
down the road, but he wasn’t assigned homework 
until high school. His teacher knew that farm kids were 
too busy—by age seven Guy was raking behind the hay 
cart, and by age ten, he was milking, weeding, hoeing, 
fixing roofs, fixing fences, and feeding cows. He started 
his days at nautical dawn, when it was still dark enough 
to see the stars, but light enough to make out the hori-
zon. The world was windless and blue, the earth still 
cold from the night before. Guy began his days silently 
like this, walking from the farmhouse to the barn and 
milking the cows before the world was awake. 

He went to Norwich University, a military college in 
Vermont, as World War II came to a close. “It was more 
than just ROTC. We had tanks,” he informed me. Guy’s 
military uncle was the one who inspired him to join 
the service. He taught Guy to shoot in the aptly named 
“Shooting Lot,” which is now an apple orchard belong-
ing to Guy’s brother. Walking through the field today, 
you can still find shell casings as big as your thumbs.

Guy was home from college the first time his father 
used DDT. The senior Mr. Beardsley composted before 
it was trendy and avoided using pesticides outside of 
his orchard. But in 1950, everyone was talking about 
the magical compound that WWII soldiers sprinkled in 
their sleeping bags to ward off pests. The other farmers 
in White Hills raved that DDT kept their crops clear 
of pests and weeds. Curious what the fuss was about, 
Mr. Beardsley and Guy waded through his three acres 
of corn with a 2 ½ gallon-sized sprayer full of the chem-
ical. When he and Guy returned to the field ten days 
later, the corn was free of weeds, but Mr. Beardsley 
was convinced there was something unnatural about it. 
Twelve years before Rachel Carson would confirm it in 
her seminal book, Silent Spring, Mr. Beardsley knew 
DDT was bad news. “If it’s doing this to the weeds,” he 
said to Guy, “what’s it doing to us?” That was the first 
and last time DDT touched Beardsley land.

Guy graduated from Norwich two years later and 
entered the Army as a Second Lieutenant. Over the 
next 28 years, his assignments took him everywhere 
from Italy to Korea to Vietnam to Texas.

He headed a tank unit in the Korean War and served 
as a pilot and Air Cavalry troop commander in Vietnam. 
By the time Guy left the service, he was a Lieutenant 
Colonel, a husband, and a father. He and his wife, Pat, 
moved 27 times throughout his military career, but they 
spent most of their time in Killeen, Texas, the sleepy, 
dusty town next to Fort Hood. They decided to move 
back to Connecticut after a particularly tumultuous two 
years during which Pat was diagnosed with cancer, her 
mother died, and both of Guy’s parents passed away. By 
1984, Killeen felt too far from home.

Guy had no intention to farm even after they moved
