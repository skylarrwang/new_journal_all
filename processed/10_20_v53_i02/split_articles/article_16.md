“If [DDT] is doing this to the weeds, what’s it doing to us?”
back to the Shelton farmhouse. It was just nice to be 
back with the maple trees he tapped for syrup as a child 
and the fence that Winner the Bull once broke through 
in pursuit of a man in a red coup. However, in 1987, 
after quitting his manager job at the nearby Petrol Plus 
to help Pat with her new antique business, Guy started 
planting vegetables in his spare time. With Pat under-
going chemotherapy, Guy wanted everything he grew to 
be completely safe and natural for her to eat. In 1988, 
together they started an organic farm. 

Organic farmers preserve the essentials. Unlike auto-
mated, pesticide-laden conventional farming, organic 
farming keeps it simple. Farmers focus on the ultimate 
fundamental: soil. Building off the premise that the 
earth is a closed system, organic farmers return every-
thing they take from the earth. If Guy plants a vegetable 
like Brussels sprouts that take nitrogen from the soil, the 
next year he’ll plant something like clover to replenish 
the spot with nitrogen. Organic farmers don’t take short-
cuts, even though it would be easier just to spray some 
pesticides and chemical fertilizers and call it a day. In 
the long run however, their steady principles don’t let 
them down.

Take the story of the diamondback moth, for instance. 
With wings closed, it resembles a brown, curled-up leaf, or 
a Praying Mantis’s friendlier cousin. But as larvae, they’re 
disturbingly wriggly caterpillars, gorging themselves on 
the undersides of leaves. Diamondback moths (DBMs for 
short) target cruciferous crops like kale or cabbage, suck-
ing the juice from their leaves until they resemble a frosted 
windowpane. DBMs don’t contaminate the produce, but 
in an age of Grapples (grape-flavored apples) and rectan-
gular watermelons, when appearances are paramount, any 
cosmetic damage could render a vegetable unsellable.

If Guy was a conventional farmer, he could extermi-
nate the diamondback moth with an insecticide like 
Lannat LV or Voliam Xpress, but that might also kill the 
farm’s pollinators and contaminate the groundwater. 
This would throw off the entire soil-produce-compost

cycle that a healthy ecosystem needs, and even then, 
the diamondback moths might not be gone. DBMs have 
been outsmarting farmers and chemists since at least 
1953, when they became the first insects to develop a 
resistance to DDT. Since then, DBMs have become 
resistant to over 95 insecticides, which is pretty much 
all of them. A short-term solution like pesticides can’t 
solve a long-term problem like pesticide-resistant pests.

Guy goes back to the basics to combat DBMs. 
Healthy plants better withstand pests, and for that, they 
need good soil. A steady method like crop rotation is the 
surest path to lasting pest prevention. By changing the 
crops and locations he plants every year, he alternates 
the nutrients removed from the soil, and bewilders the 
pests who wait for last year’s crop in last year’s field. Ask 
a conventional farmer about his DBM problem and he 
might mention a new pesticide he’s trying, but more 
often than not, he’ll tell you about crop rotation, a tech-
nique that farmers have been using for millenia. Even 
conventional growers have learned to value simple, 
organic solutions.

Farmers tormented by DBMs haven’t been the only 
ones turning to organic methods. Around the same time 
Guy was flying fixed-wing Otters over Vietnam in the 
1960s, a group of young anti-war protestors was learn-
ing to farm in the northeast. Scared straight by Rachel 
Carson’s Silent Spring and inspired by the early envi-
ronmental movement, they started the Northeast 
Organic Farming Association (NOFA), hoping to bring 
about a collective return to the soil. Most of NOFA’s 
early members were academics, not farmers. NOFA’s 
founder, Samuel Kaymen, grew up assuming that food 
was assembled in the back of the grocery store. He and 
his wife Louisa left mainstream society in 1964 to start 
a self-sufficient farm in upstate New York. However, 
he quickly realized that library books about farming 
weren’t going to cut it: Samuel, and others like him, 
needed practical experience and help. He founded 
NOFA to fill their knowledge gaps. The association des-
ignated farms as “Certified Organic,” but most impor-
tantly, it was a way for northeastern farmers to educate 
one another. 

Bill Duesing, a Yale graduate and organic activist, 
was among the shaggy-haired farmers gathered in a 
Vermont field for NOFA’s first meeting in 1971. It was 
an informal affair—to an outside observer, the meeting 
probably looked like nothing more than a bunch of 
“sixties kids” (as Guy calls them) crouching in weeds. 
Despite NOFA’s humble beginnings, state chapters 
quickly sprang up around the northeast, and in 1982, 
“What God created there are the life forces. Life forces. Very important.”

Bill decided to start a NOFA group in Connecticut. Guy 
and Pat met Bill a few years later, and Guy joined the 
NOFA board as its most unlikely member. He’d fought 
in the war they’d protested. Their dramatic return to the 
soil was just an adoption of the methods that his fam-
ily had used for generations. Despite their differences, 
Guy, Pat, Bill, and Bill’s wife, Suzanne, worked together 
to establish about a dozen farmer’s markets throughout 
Connecticut. Guy’s dedication hasn’t gone unnoticed: 
even now, the Monroe Farmers Market throws him a 
birthday party every year.

“Not much red this year,” Guy said last October, ges-
turing at the thicket of trees across the street from his 
potato field. We’d parked the Gator and were checking 
to see  if there were any more potatoes to dig up before 
November’s garlic planting season. I hadn’t noticed it 
before, but he was right. The fall trees were only orange 
and yellow around here. Guy told me that this had to 
do with rainfall. If the fall weather is too moist, the 
leaves won’t turn red. I’d never wondered why the trees 
changed the colors they did before. I’m from Southern 
California, where the only season is spring.

Guy sees no need to beat around the bush when it 
comes to the cycle of life. Last October, he took me 
to the tree where they defeather the freshly killed 
Thanksgiving turkeys. He pointed out the practical fea-
tures of the tree that made it perfect for “processing”: 
it had low-hanging branches and was far enough away 
that the turkeys still alive in the enclosure couldn’t see 
their fallen comrades. Once, at his brother’s farm shop 
toward the end of November, Guy discussed the turkey 
slaughtering process—in great detail—with his brother 
behind the counter. The Thanksgiving shoppers were 
scandalized. His friend Becky reminded him that he 
should refer to the process in public as “preparing the 
turkeys for their big day,” but he thought those euphe-
misms were ridiculous. Turkeys are raised as farm ani-
mals—harvesting them is just another part of the fall 
season.

Guy gets almost as excited talking about last year’s 
rainfall as he does telling stories about the times that 
God has saved his life. Guy loves God. He particularly 
loves stories in which God plays a starring role. “I’m tell-
ing you, God was in complete control of that situation! 
Complete control!” he said, concluding a story about 
the time when, mid-flight in Vietnam, an unpinned gre-
nade miraculously failed to detonate. His mother was 
a devout Christian and brought him up in the church. 
Some people have a “born again” moment, but Guy 
never did. “I always figured that God was part of my life, 
and God has really done a tremendous amount of work 
with me in keeping me alive,” he said. “He brought me 
through twenty-eight years in the Army.”

God and the cosmos have a place in the day-to-day of 
Guy’s farm. He operates his planting season according 
to the Stella Natura biodynamic calendar hanging from 
a clipboard in the hoop-house. It’s an updated version of 
an astrological planting system first used by the ancient 
Egyptians on their farms in the Nile Delta. Using the 
movements of the planets and stars as a guide, the cal-
endar can tell you the right time to plant or transplant 
every category of produce (root, flower, fruit, and leaf). 
Guy loves that the Stella Natura connects his farm to 
a divine astrological system. “What God created there 
are the life forces. Life forces,” he repeated. “Very 
important.” For Guy, everything is part of a beautifully 
orchestrated natural system. We watched the pollinators 
work their magic on the squash one day. “All kinds of 
creatures can pollinate it,” Guy said, pointing to the 
beetles and bees crawling inside a squash flower’s ova. 
“Some creatures like to even sleep in them,” he said. I 
laughed and asked if the plants minded the intrusion. 
“No, they’re okay. They’re just doing their part,” he said. 
“They’re doing good, they’re doing good.”

As he nears ninety-one, Guy has slowed his pace, but 
not by much. He received a lifetime achievement award 
from the Connecticut chapter of NOFA this spring, and 
his Eco-Garden remains a top destination for quality 
seedlings and specialty products like lavender and black 
garlic. Twice a month, Guy co-hosts “The Organic 
Farm Stand,” a radio show on WPKN 89.5 FM. On 
the first and third Thursday every month, rain or shine, 
Guy’s on the air, providing listeners from Connecticut 
to Rhode Island with farm updates and organic growing 
tips. Even after hip surgery last year, Guy called into the 
show from his sickbed. 

Soon, it will be mid-November. If this year is the 
same as the last, Guy will spend most of his days on 
the tractor, harrowing the fields in preparation for gar-
lic planting. Later in the month, when it’s so cold his 
fingers go numb, he’ll be in the fields with his friends 
and farmhands, placing garlic bulbs in the soil. In April, 
the scapes will break through the ground, reaching up 
for spring sunlight; Guy will snap them off and grind 
them into pesto. And come July, when the barn swal-
lows begin their southward migration, Guy will harvest 
the garlic and bring it to market.
