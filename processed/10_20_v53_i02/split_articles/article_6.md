sideration of the five-year age difference between Emma 
and her girlfriend, who is a graduate student at Yale. 
Once Emma arrived in New Haven, having moved 
here for the school year, she met up with her now-girl-
friend. She was initially nervous about how their rela-
tionship would translate to being in-person and explicitly 
romantic, but Emma told me that she feels that it has only 
strengthened since meeting up.  They have been dating 
since. 


Quinn*, a junior, felt that the pan-
demic placed a newfound pressure on 
her relationship, which had already sur-
vived periods of long-distance. 
She met her boyfriend on move-in day 
her first year at Yale. It’s disputed where 
exactly they first bumped into each other 
— either at the beginning or the end of 
a tour of their residential college. They 
lived in adjoined suites, but didn’t start 
dating until the following spring. It was her first “adult 
relationship” and her first time falling in love. They went 
through their fair share of difficulties — they had been 
long distance the summer before their sophomore year 
and planned to be apart last spring because Quinn was 
studying abroad (though once the pandemic worsened 
globally, all Yale students were called back to the States). 
“The summer, bizarrely, was the happiest time in the rela-
tionship,” she said. We were speaking over Zoom, and she 
seemed wistful. “We got to be fully present because there 
aren’t a billion other things on your mind.” 
They were in the same state over the summer, so it was 
possible to see each other over weekends. It wasn’t as hard 
being long-distance during lockdown because “life was on 
pause.” They had seemingly endless amounts of time to 
devote to talking to each other.  “During a pandemic, all 
the benefits of being in a relationship are amplified — the 
convenience, the companionship, the safety of having a 
dedicated partner,” Quinn told me.  
But when it came time for the fall semester, Quinn’s 
boyfriend left the States to be at home with his family and 
Quinn came to New Haven. As life creeped back to nor-
malcy and school started back up, Quinn said, “It seemed 
as though our lives were resuming [after lockdown], but 
very much separately.” 
Somewhat unexpectedly, this was the period of long-dis-
tance that the relationship could not survive. It was dif-
ficult to conceive of a concrete future together because 
it was unclear when Quinn’s boyfriend would be able to 
return to New Haven. They struggled with the question 
of: “What does a relationship mean when you don’t know 
the next time you can see that person, and you don’t have 
a date to peg your hopes on?” 
Quinn and her boyfriend broke up during the fall 
semester, over the phone. When I spoke to Quinn, she 
was still trying to figure out how to recover from the con-
clusion of a long-term relationship during a period of 
reduced social contact.   
“It’s very strange because life is a lot quieter these days, 
so it’s a tough time to go through a loss like that,” Quinn 
told me. She added, laughing, “But maybe 
it’s also good, because otherwise I would 
have gone to Woads and done something 
stupid.” 

Despite the unprecedented nature of this 
semester, students I’ve spoken to have all 
tried to regain a sense of normalcy, whether 
it be through discovering new communities 
or forging romantic relationships.  They’ve 
embraced, wholeheartedly, the imperfect 
forms that love takes during these strange 
times. Most Yalies seem to have taken this opportunity to 
learn new lessons about themselves. Something I learned, 
personally, is that we get so caught up in relationships at 
Yale to somewhat relieve the pressure we feel to make the 
most of our time here. This is meant to be the prime of 
our lives, but we are pulled in so many directions, all the 
time, beholden to academic responsibilities, extracurric-
ular pursuits, and social endeavors. The pandemic and its 
mandated social isolation has distilled life into its essen-
tial elements, challenging us to decide what really matters 
in the end. 
I thought back to my interview with Quinn and how 
she perfectly encapsulated what many of us are feeling 
right now: “I am learning that it’s okay that there are times 
when life doesn’t feel so glowing and ecstatic, which we 
are told that every moment of college should be like.”
