EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"Students will ridicule it." Meeks wrote a 
number of letters to Savage begging him to 
clean up his symbolism. They seem to have 
had some effect. 

When the mural was finally unveiled, 
the Hoot tried to raise spirits by pointing 
out the alternative, "The faculty of the Art 
School is, we understand, much relieved at 
the outcome; the mural is far less 
objectionable than it had dared hope. 
Original sketches had been disconcertingly 
informal in composition, and one focused 
as its central point on the impressive rumps 
of a large pink horse." 

Meeks saved future generations from 
the shock of a giant pink bottom in 
Sterling, but he couldn't save them from a 
thinly veiled satire of the university and 
academia. The painting had been subjected 
to over a half-century 
of faculty and student 
ridicule since its first 
exposure to the dim 
light of the library. 
Rogers was well 
aware of all 
the 
turmoil caused by 
Savage's satiric mural. 
But when the time 
came to choose an 
artist for his next 
project 
at 
University of Chicago, 
Rogers turned again to 
Savage. The result-
Athena standing in an 
ancient 
portal 
in 
midtown Manhattan-could have shocked 
only someone unaware of the Yale fiasco. 
Again Savage ignored repeated pleas from 
university administrators. Again he met 
accusations and vicious criticism. And 
again a university would suffer lasting 
humiliation. Savage's Chicago masterpiece 
was dubbed "The Ugly Mural." 

Part of the problem was that no one 
was willing to stand up to an artist chosen 
by Rogers. One administrator wrote that he 
seriously doubted a Committee would go 
so very far "in disapproving or approving of 
the mural by an artist selected by Mr. 
Rogers." Why would Rogers lend his 
credibility to an artist whose work was so 
universally disliked? A personal friendship? 
Maybe, but it may also have been because 
their senses for satire were so compatible. 

The mocking spirit of James Gamble 
Rogers found expression in more 
than just decorations. The buildings 
themselves are his greatest commentary. In 
some cases, as with the Law School, he 
chose to make fun-house reflections of 
Oxford and Cambridge. Other times, 
imitations gave way to elaborate parody. 

The main entrance hall of Sterling 
Library is a mock cathedral. Confessional 
booths have become telephone booths; the 
altar is used as a check-out counter; scenes 
from the passion play became scenes from 
the history of Connecticut; the portrait of 
the Virgin Mary is replaced by one of Alma 
Macer; and the Holy Book is converted 
into what seems to be an early version of 
the Blue Book. 

There isn't necessarily anything more 
than good wholesome fun behind Rogers' 
architectural punning. But obvious 
explanations for his multi-million dollar 
play on buildings were never entirely 
accepted. A 1931 issue of the Harkness 
Hoot asked, "Is there any honesty in hiding 
the magnificent function of a tower of 
books under a cloakage that has no more 
relevance to it than to a grain elevator? ... 
All this, in the university whose motto is 
Lux and Veritas. There is not one 
suggestion of Vericas in the Sterling 
Library, and for that matter there is 
precious little of Lux." 

Sterling is the showpiece of Yale's 
mutant gothic style, but Rogers' cathedral 
of learning makes tribute to neither 
divinity nor scholarship. It is perhaps a 
monument only to its creator. And if, as is 
inscribed on the main entrance of Sterling, 
"The Library is the Heart of the 
University," what does this elaborate farce 
say about Yale? 

Yale used to be a campus of open vistas 
with unassuming architecture in the style 
of Connecticut Hall. But when Rogers 
took over as consulting architect, Yale 
began to close herself in. Gothic facades, 
erected with the money of the roaring 
twenties and the labor of 
the dirty thirties, made 
for a city of fortresses, 
each guarded by its stone 
walls, moat and spiked 
iron gates. The walls are 
austere, 
moats 
enclosing, the gates 
forbidding. 

And even those who 
enter the sanctuary of the 
inner courtyards face the 
persistent 
satire 
of 
sculptures that question 
their right to be there. 
There is nothing inviting 
or reassuring about devils 
overlooking 
people 
masturbating in coffins. Nor is there much 
majesty in a man sitting on a potty: And 
whether it's a jester triumphing over 
justice, or a devil laughing at the Lord, or a 
dog mounting a man, these sculptures 
throw into doubt the values which a 
university should hold sacred. How much 
of it do we unknowingly hear and how 
much of it can we safely ignore when we 
walk in Rogers' world?
