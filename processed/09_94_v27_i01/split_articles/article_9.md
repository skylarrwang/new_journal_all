want ro study ethnic studies don't want to 
find that they can't study something else," 
he says. "There's a financial matter. When 
adding a certain department, you might 
hurt others." 
One Yale minority student group 
leader, who prefers to remain anonymous, 
lumps Brodhead's explanation into what 
he calls the "administration's favorite 
excuse" to ward off demands for ethnic 
studies. In a panel discussion at Yale last 
year, one Japanese-American activist 
argued that creating new programs does 
not subtract from existing ones. "Don't 
ever buy the 'zero-sum game theory,"' he 
said. When the administration of a 
university defines a need, for example a 
new football scoreboard, it begins an effort 
to raise the funds from various 
organizations, trusts, and companies-it 
does not necessarily rake the money from 
current programs or causes. Rather than 
hindering current operations, it can 
benefit the university as a whole.

programs. "We 
know that there 
is a call to do 
various ethnic 
studies," 
says 
associate provost 
McCord. "What 
that gene.rally 
means gets a 
little 
muddy. 
Sometimes, for 
example, Korean students want Korean 
studies, but they mean East Asian, not 
Korean-American, and the two areas are 
very different. So sometimes the request is 
even muddy." McCord expresses concern 
over the complexity and difficulty in 
structuring ethnic studies courses. "In a 
group as complex as those people who call 
t hemselves Asian-Americans, we have 
Filipinos wanting representation, South 
Asians wanting representation ... everybody 
wants their own and they're not thinking 
about 'what would contribute to my 
education?"' 
Leaders from the Asian-American 
Student Alliance and Korean American 
Students of Yale recount that in meetings 
with administrators, university officials 
explain that they can not give one ethnic 
study a commitment because other groups 
would then want the same commitment, 
and there are not enough resources to 
provide for all the diverse groups. Says 
Linna Choi (ES '96), "I think we should 
look at African-American studies as a 
model. If we are able to create a 
department to house studies in such a 
diverse culrure, we can do it in an ethnic 
studies department." In the meantime, 
frustrations build on the campus about 
both ethnic studies and minority 
representation. "In a way I feel cheated," 
says MEChA President Ramirez, "This is 
my university. Why can't I learn about the 
community I come from? Even Swedish 
and German universities have Chicano 
studies." 


A
ide from its relevance to minority 
epresentation, ethnic studies stands 
s a necessary scholarly enterprise in 
its own right. "I don't argue that we should 
have ethnic studies just to get more 
minorities. That's secondary. I argue that 
we should do ethnic studies because it is a 
legitimate, scholarly, pedagogical goal for 
the American public, 
particularly 
academics," says Jaynes. "If we are to be 
sincere in understanding this culture, we 
have to know about these groups, and right 
now our knowledge of most is pitiful." 
Hsu discusses ethnic studies as but one 
issue under the larger concern of course-
curriculum priorities at Yale. "Let's say one 
scholar leaves a department, thus creating a 
vacancy; who's to say what's more 
important? It's the faculty. But as members 
of the university community, students 
should voice their input," she says. "I find 
very few fields of study which have a very 
definite idea of what needs to be taught." If 
in fact the Yale faculty decides the bulk of 
Yale curricula, who exactly constitutes the 
Yale faculty? Statistics in the Jaynes Report 
show a faculty about 94 percent white. 
European thought provided the founding 
base of America, but demographers predict 
our society will have a white minority by
