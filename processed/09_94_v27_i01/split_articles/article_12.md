satiric relation between the sculprures. And 
it seems likely that one of these people was 
the prankster who divined it. 


The same queer sense of humor is at 
work on the book tower of Sterling Library. 
Beneath a set of gothic windows, are four 
bas relief heads. On the far left is a yale 
(the two-horned mythical beast)-a symbol 
of the University. On the far right is a 
student dressed up in a cap and tassel-a 
symbol of scholarship. Between them are 
two savage demons with fangs bared in 
threatening grimace. 


The mixing of satanic symbols with 
scholarly ones is roo blatant to have 
escaped Rogers's discerning eye. The four 
heads are so high up and so close together 
that they appear more as a group than as 
individuals. And no matter how you 
interpret it, the portrait isn't flattering of 
either Yale or her students. 


Not all of this architectural cant has 
gone unnoticed. Even as "the New Yale" 
was still taking form, a 1930 issue of the 
Harknm Hoot leveled its bitter criticism. 
"It violates all canons of good taste by 
deliberately misusing the Gothic details 
with which it abounds. How can students 
be educated to artistic appreciation under 
the eaves of an architecture that puts water 
tanks in church towers, and lavatories in 
oriels? It seems dubious what lesson of 
honesty the young man can derive from 
such misuses and untruths." 


Â· Yale lecturer Lila Freedman writes, "But 
what is most curious is that many [of the 
Law School ornaments] are deliberately 
satiric, implicitly commenting upon or 
even explicitly mocking the very concepts 
that presumably are taught within the 
building itself." 


Says Lord, "This architecture has a lot 
of authority and it's conditioning people all 
the time. I think it's enclosing and very 
insistent. I think undergraduates are 
negatively affected, irritated, and finally 
even depressed by it." 


Why would an institution like Yale 
portray through its ornaments so 
much cynicism about the values 
of education? Why a jester triumphing over 
Justice? Why all the animals dressed up as 
magistrates and lawyers? Why all the 
portrayals of drunken and decadent 
students? Why the recurring connections 
between students and demons? 


According to Yale legend, the 
draftsmen did it. The story goes that 
underpaid Italian stone masons decided to 
vent their frustrations against an elitist 
institution by carving their insults into the 
buildings. And when they tired of carving 
insults, they decided to carve themselves. 
In the front arches ofHGS appear the faces 
of all the draftsmen. 


But 
this 
common 
knowledge 
explanation is more myth than fact, said 
History of Art professor Vincent Scully. 
"These stories of spontaneous creation and 
happy draftsmen have developed afterwards 
. .. I say I'd be willing to bet that you 
could find sketches for every one [of the 
ornaments)." 


Wesley Needham, whose face is carved 
in the right hand 'archway of HGS, 
remembers the decision to portray 
draftsmen on the building. Like all other 
decisions about ornaments, it came from 
the architectural designer and not from the 
draftsmen themselves. Sketches for 
ornaments originated as a rule in the office 
of the head designer. James Gamble Rogers 
would review the sketches at a weekly 
session. In the case of the faces of HGS, he 
seems to have given approval even though 
it was another flagrant violation of the 
University 
Decoration 
Committee 
guidelines. 


In fact, an effort may have been made 
to hide some of the more offensive statues 
from the draftsmen. Needham remembers 
that the man on the potty was not on the 
plans for Trumbull's west courtyard. He 
says that the plans he worked on showed 
only a straightforward finial. Needham 
admits he really doesn't know how the 
potty man got there, but he figures that it 
must have been put on afterwards by 
undergraduates because, "No faculty 
member would ever do that." He adds, "It 
is perfectly formed over the finial. It is well 
done ... I would like to know how they 
did it." 


But it seems that undergrads had 
nothing to do with it. Photographs show 
the potty man on his throne shortly after 
the building was finished. The pictures 
created a bit of a stir, and Rogers made no 
effort to deny responsibility. 


Another explanation for the satire is 
that architect and chief designers used 
satirical ornament in an attempt to mimic 
the medieval gothic style. "They thought 
they were being very medieval," Scully says. 
"These people were acting out of a social 
myth about gothic architecture." Nothing
