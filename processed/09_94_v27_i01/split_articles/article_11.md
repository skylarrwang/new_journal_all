Look· up and laugh at Ya le's twisted gargoyles-before they laugh at you. 
Wl
esley Needham has known Sterling Library 
longer chan anyone. Fifty-two years ago he 
helped build it. In the intervening half-century 
he must have passed the check-out desk tens of 
thousands of times. But it wasn't until a short while ago that he 
noticed something unusual. 

High above the check-out desk, perched over the mural of 
Alma Mater, is a large sculptured vampire bat with its fangs bared 
in a fiendish laugh. Presiding over the magnificent entrance hall, it 
occupies the most commanding position in Sterling's "cathedral of 
learning." A position which in less secular cathedrals would be 
reserved for a guardian angel. 

In our gothic world we are surrounded 
by stone figures which give lasting 
expression to a strange commentary. 
Sometimes it is just distracting. Often it is 
satiric or secretly insulting. But at times it is 
openly condemning, sacrilegious, and even 
perverted. The voice comes down from the 
Gothic 
fa~ades with unpunctuated 
insistence, but so subtly that we don't 
consciously hear it. 

On the roof of Trumbull College's lower 
courtyard is the figure of a man perched on 
a stone potty with his pants down around 
his heels. Grinning foolishly, he defecates on 
the college below. "I don't like to pass it 
when I'm taking tours through the west 
court," says Needham. "I don't think it's a nice thing for ladies-
elderly or otherwise-to see. I've complained about it but no one 
seems to want to take it down." 

On Trumbull's Elm and High Street corner, the humor gets 
more perverse. A relief shows a devil blowing a horn as a dog 
mounts a drunken man-a symbol of sodomy. Another bas-relief 
beneath the defecating man shows more devils and strange ritual; a 
group of hooded and costumed people gather round laughing at a 
man in a coffin. The man appears to be 
masturbating. 

The most disturbing element in it all is the 
implied sacrilege. A statue on Davenport's York 
Street fa~ade shows the Lord and the devil 
conspiring in a joke. The devil grins slyly at the Lord, who hoots 
with laughter. The statue is not garish. And it only becomes 
offensive when you begin to wonder what it was meant to 
symbolize. 

At the far end of Sterling Archives is the circular Gothic vault 
originally used to house the Gutenberg Bible. Above the gates 
which protect the room are two suitably reverent religious figures. 
But faces of jesters and horned devillike creatures line the gates 
· themselves. More frightening than the presence of demons is their 
placement. Why devils on a gate which guarded a text of so much 
religious significance? 

In Sterling Library, the humor takes an 
anti-academic. twist. Lining the exhibition 
corridor, fourteen statuettes give satiric 
renditions of scholars. A student reads as a 
cloaked and hooded skeleton clings to his 
shoulder. A gluttonous drunken student 
smokes and gawks at a pin-up nude. The 
last statuette shows a student chortling over 
a book inscribed with the words "U.R.A. 
JOKE." 

Officially, at least, the statuettes were 
supposed to satirize not students, but 
different types of study. All the same, the 
student reading "U.R.A. JOKE" seems to 
bear the brunt of his own laughter. The 
cryptic message is more contemptuous than 
it is clever. Are we meant to laugh at the 
book, at the student, or at ourselves? 

One could go on and on. At the Law School, cynical, anti-
academic jokes abound. On the tops of the finials, four foot 
sculpted animals conduct a "mock trial" over the whole Law 
School. Wolves and parrots dress up as lawyers; their clients are 
donkeys and goats with money bags. On Grove Street, Justice falls 
at the mercy of a jester; her scales tip as a fool in cap and bells pulls 
a blindfold down over her eyes. 

There is something discomforting about the 
fun these buildings have at our expense. "It's not 
really very funny," protests former Master of 
Trumbull George Lord. "There is an eclecticism 
about it all which is very disturbing. Unlike at 
Oxford and Cambridge, the architecture here is inward-looking 
with a hostile streak toward the rest of the world." 

There is something odd in using an architecture to portray 
people defecating or devils masturbating when the institution is 
supposedly devoted to loftier pursuits. There is something 
dishonest about a building which on its fas;ades pays reverent 
tribute to divinity and in its interior makes a lasting and bitter 
mockery of it. "I think it's a little gross and a little demeaning," 
says Lord. "On a public act of creation an architect cannot ignore 
the symbolism of his work." 

B
ut the architect, James Gamble Rogers, was not one to ignore 
the little things in a building. He must have known. 
"(Rogers' firm] had been organized as very much an 
extension of his own personality," writes his grandson j.G. Rogers 
III. "It had been organized both to allow him maximum control 
over every aspect of the business and maximum freedom for 
himself ... Rogers' control on the design of the buildings went 
virtually unchecked." As Yale's consulting architect, Rogers had the 
power to create his own little university. In less than a decade he 
built the "new Yale"; Harkness Tower, Sterling Memorial Library, 
the Law School, the Graduate School, and nine of the colleges. He 
did it all with an obsession for detail and a mania for control which 
set him aparr from other architects. 

Rogers had little respect for the quibbling university 
committees set up to keep him in check. As they sar heatedly 
debating whether or not an apple should appear ar Isaac Newron's 
feet, he wrote, "I shall be very glad to do any or all of rhe work of 
the committee but there will arise a rime when the builders have to 
have models. In fact, they are howling for them now. Yes, howling 
is the word." 

Rogers repeatedly ignored the committee's ban on carving busts 
of living people. H e made sure he and his designers were 
immortalized in Indiana limestone wherever possible. Bur his 
egotism went beyond the desire to see his smiling face. As Yale's 
architect supreme, he was the author of a world of stone, and he 
was not above leaving a few cryptic messages. 

Take the curio us juxtaposition of two roof sculptures on 
symmetrically opposite sides of the Sterling Library. One is a Yale 
student bowed over his books as though in prayer. The other, a 
horned demon with a spiked tail, hunches over in the same pose. A 
long, thick, phallic tongue thrusts out past his chin as he grasps 
something unrecognizable tightly against his pelvis. When viewed 
side by side, it is hard to see the demon as anything but a satiric 
corruption of the Yalie. But it's nor a connection the average tourist 
is likely to make. The demon is hidden behind the Reserve Reading 
Room, so the two sculptures cannot be viewed simultaneously. 

All the sam~. the connection seems to have been deliberate and 
more than one person must have known abour it. Plasrer models 
for most of the library's sculptures were made, and shown to Rogers 
for approval. A Yale archives picture collection shows photographs 
of each model. 

But, the collecrion also shows that in the case of the two roof 
sculptures, a singular exception was made. Someone moved model 
31 (the student) next to model 98 (the demon) and took a picture 
of them side by side. A strange statement about students, which 
might otherwise have been overlooked, became strikingly obvious. 
Whoever rook that picture and whoever saw it knew about the
