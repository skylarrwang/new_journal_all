riter Earl Derr Biggs did much more than write a 
little story about a Chinese detective in 1925. He 
created a legacy. In the introduction to the Asian-
American literarure anthology Char/it Chan is Dtad, 
editor Jessica Hagedorn quotes the fictional Charlie: 
"Observe." 
"When weaving nets, all threads counted." 
"Woman's intuition like feather on arrow. May help flight to 
truth." 
"Necessity mother of invention, but sometimes stepmother of 
deception." 
"Boy scout knife, like ladies' hairpin. Have many uses." 
"Best place for skeleton is in family closet." 
"Chinese people interested in aJI things psychic." 
"If strength were all, tiger would not fear scorpion." 
Oburvt. But this anthology refuses to sit back and watch while 
quaintly insulting characters like Charlie toddle by on the screen 
and along the pages of books. Char/it Chan is Dtad refuses to 
observe all the niceties of traditional representations. Its stories will 
not and do not follow the wobbly footsteps of Charlie Chan, 
though for many years his path appeared to be the only one 
available. The title resounds mantra-like. Charlie Chan embodies all 
that is abhorrent to writers attempting to fashion rich and complex 
Asian-American literarure; he talks one talk and walks one walk, but 
for all his one-dimensionality enjoys the throne as the sole Asian 
figure in American pop culture. Char/it Chan is Dtad dethrones this 
icon and precipitates his metaphorical death. By following eclectic 
narrative lines of their own, Meena Alexander, Hisaye Yamamoto, 
Kimiko Hahn, Maxine Hong Kingston, Russell Leong, Carlos 
Bulosan, Shawn Wong, and the 42 other writers 
rejuvenate the moribund picrure of Asian Americans 
in mainstream literary discourse. 

Char/it Chan is Dtad distinguishes itself as a body of 
contemporary Asian-American literature portraying Asian-American 
women, men, and children in the myriad roles they play, not simply 
as one-dimensional characters glorifying the "Occidentalized" 
version of the "Oriental" mystique. These stories unleash all of the 
unruliness of Asian-American identity and caress the tender sides as 
well. By their very diversity, the stories in this anthology challenge 
the very notion of a ftxed cultural identity, privileging complexity 
and richness, unfettered by racial stereotype. 

The writings are outrageous, somber, brash, tender, lush, sparse. 
Nostalgic and tired they are not: 
"Up in her room Moon brooded and swore on a stack of Bibles 
that she would seek revenge for this terrible incident-and that if 
she were to die today she would come back to earth as an angry 
ghost to haunt those motherfuckers." -from "Moon" by Marilyn 
Chin 
"Edgar Ramirez is a faggot. Mrs. Takemoto knows it. She's 
always telling him to stop putting his hair behind his ears." -from 
"They Like You Because You Eat Dog, So What Are You Gonna Do 
About It? (8 vignettes)" by R. Zamora Linmark 
Charlie Chan's successors bear none of his cultural markings. 
They are people in all their seriousness and irony, joy and bitterness, 
and anger. 
A:.
mong the writers is former Yale professor of 
American Studies Kimiko Hahn, who 
aught Asian-American literature in 1991 
and 1992 in addition to wriring poetry. Her story 
"Afterbirth" wrestles with the question of birth and its 
effects on women and their lives. But the images of birth 
depart from traditional motherly depictions: "In some 
societies women eat the placenta after that final stage: 
the expulsion of the afterbirth when the belly heaves a 
great sigh and lies on the pelvis like a nostalgic sack." 
Hahn, who in an interview cited Monique Wittig 
and Marguerite Duras as influences, writes in a non-
linear fashion, stringing together sketches which 
emulate the fluidity of film. The placenta weaves 
its way through the narrative; Hahn fabricates 
myths about what happens to the placenta, or 
the afterbirth, in various societies. Interspersed 
with these myths, Hahn places sketches 
about pairs of women whose lives change 
dramatically after the birth of a child. "I was interested 
in what happens to women when one has a family and the 
ocher doesn't," said Hahn. The characters Rose and Hazel in 
"Afterbirth" share an understanding about what the birth of Haul's 
baby will do to their sisterly relationship: "They knew within 24 
hours an event would sever their frames of reference so they'd never 
feel quite the same closeness. And that their whole lives were a 
preparation for the loss the baby would bring, male or female." 
Anti-nostalgia pervades "Empty Heart," by Lois-Ann Yamanaka, 
who appropriates the pidgin dialect spoken in her native Hawaii. 
She writes in the brief introduction to her piece, "Our language bas 
been labeled the language of ignorant people, substandard, and 
inappropriate in any form of expression-written or oral." 
However, Yamanaka refuses to accept this imposed shame to write 
in the "voice of [her) place." Her young female narrator tells the 
story of her romance with WtllyJo: "He wait by the fence until the 
bell for recess time and I run to him fast and sneaky as I can, hide 
behind the hibiscus hedge and sit in the tall ironweed. I put my 
fingers through the chain links to touch his face. He kiss my fingers." 
Both Yamanaka's and Hahn's pieces depict Asian-American 
women as more than just exotic courtesans. Not only do the stories 
in Charli~ Chan is D~ad reject constraining images of women, but 
tbey offer new representations of Asian-American men as well. 
Charlie Chan simpers about, toeing the line between asexual and 
effeminate; Raymond Ding in Shawn Wong's "Eye Contact" 
engages in a sexual relationship with Aurora Crane, who is of mixed 
descent. 
Raymond's 
developed 
sexuality defies 
the notion that 
being an Asian-
American male 
means 
being 
sexually impotent. 
The 
relationship 
between 
Raymond 
and Aurora marks a 
radical departure from a 
literary tradition in which the 
desire between Asian-American women and men rareiy receives 
attention. 

In his heyday, Charlie Chan offered America its only insight 
into the mind of the "yellow man." But in appropriating his image, 
editor Jessica Hagedorn and the 48 writers in Charli~ Chan is D~ad 
gain the power to supplant it with new ones. 
"Charlie Chan is indeed dead, never to be revived," declaims 
Elaine Kim in her preface to the book, perhaps a bit prematurely. 
Cloaked in subdety, anti-Asian sentiment still lingers in the public 
psyche. Yet Char/i~ Chan is D~ad makes no claim to eradicate 
racism. It alone cannot transform years of bias. But it docs force us 
to question the politics of representation and cultural identity. It 
compels us to investigate the case of this mythical Charlie Chan, to 
sniff out the clues and catch the culprit red-handed.
