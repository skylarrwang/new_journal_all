the world's population lives in urban areas. And as the world's 
population increases and societies become more urban, expanding 
metropolises will place greater demands on surrounding natural 
resou rce systems. For instance, housing developmen t in the 
Baltimore region between 1980 and 1990 caused the highest level 
of deforestation (180,000 acres) in the northeastern United States. 
Losing forests increases stormwater runoff and water pollution, 
thereby damaging regional ecosystems such as the Chesapeake Bay 
and the Long Island Sound. And within urban areas themselves, 
environmental, racial, and class inequities th reaten community 
stability and health. Change will not come quickly; the process of 
restoration req uires long-term commitments and a sense of 
humbleness in the face of these challenges. Beware of those who 
think they know best. 


fter Ralph Jones challenged Yale to develop a new focus for 
environmental action, others inspired me to rethink who 
hould lead the efforts to revitalize these areas. D uring a 
presentation at the School of Forestry, Wes Jackson, Director of the 
Land Institute, delivered a challenge in his midwestern drawl: "At 
Yale you have had Gifford Pinchot and Aldo Leopold, but what 
have you done lately?" (Pinchot established both the U.S. Forest 
Service and the Yale School of Forestry, and Leopold, in The Sand 
County Almanac, popularized an ethic of conservation.) Jackson's 
question caught me off guard. I was surprised to think that we, as a 
university, were supposed to do something about the environment. 
After all, aren't universities only su pposed to accumulate 
knowledge, repackage it, and then dispense it? But actually do 
something in the real world? And if universities are to act, do we 
have a legacy of traditions and lessons to translate into innovative 
solutions for the future? In all these cases, I believe the answer is 
yes. 


Yale certainly has a tremendous h istory of producing 
environmentalists. Besides Pinchot and Leopold, Yale's alumni 
include Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New York City's 
Central Park, to Robert Moses, who built upon Olmsted's work 
and structured that city's parks and parkway system. 


What do these former Yalies have in com mon? Products of the 
Progressive Era, they believed that government could serve as a 
positive force in solving society's problems. They translated these 
beliefs into public service careers devoted to the environment. They 
acted. Today, many of their works lie incomplete or discarded; their 
principles, abandoned. But the efforts of Olmsted, Moses, Pinchot, 
and Leopold provide insight into what we, as univer.sities, should 
do now. 


Ideally, a university should foster a sense of public duty among 
students, naining them to work in government, non-profit 
organizations, and the private sector to remedy society's injustices. 
Within the university context, these values and skills can converge 
into environmental action. 


It is in such a context that URI works with the classical 
definition of a university's three roles: research, education, and 
extension. We have studied the social and economic factors that 
affect individual and community participation in forestry projects. 
We have developed programs for local youth, city agency 
personnel, and Yale students. And in terms of extension, my 
responsibilities have varied from working as a technician 
identifying tree diseases to writing watershed management plans. 
Through these tasks, I have gained knowledge of the possible and 
developed the skills to achieve it. 


But how to combine streams and 
neighborhoods, parks and people? 


But I have also learned why so much of the work of Olmsted, 
Pinchot, Moses, and Leopold remains undone. These past Yalies 
saw only two vehicles for action-individuals and government. 
They promoted populist ideals but were unwilling to trust 
communities with the power to achieve their goals. Communities 
can provide an intermediary between individuals and government 
in a continuum of environmental action. 


To mobilize individuals, communities, and government 
agencies for effective environmental action, we need to focus on 
four primary areas. First, we need ro re-orient government to 
respond more effectively to people's needs and to treat 
communities as part of the solution instead of part of the problem. 
We also need to develop intra- and inter-jurisdictional cooperation. 
A great deal of the Chesapeake Bay and the Long Island Sound's 
problems arise from the inability of federal, state, and local agencies 
to work together. 'Secondly, we need ro increase the amount of 
information available to public agencies and community activists. 
Too often, officials horde information and use it as power. Thirdly, 
we need to develop training and educational programs that provide 
people with the information and skills ro identify and meet their 
needs. We describe this educational program as the three As: 
awareness, appreciation, and action. 
•Awareness: In our youth programs, we work in the field to 
help students understand the connections between their individual 
actions, their community, and their environment-the air they 
breathe, the water they drink, and the fish 
they eat from the Bay. At the beginning of 
our program in Baltimore, we asked the 
students to name three bodies of water 
near their homes. None of the students 
could answer the question even though 
they lived within a mile of the Chesap.eake 
Bay. 
•Appreciation: 
These 
young 
participants raised questions about the 
importance and value of the environmem 
compared to other things: jobs, cars, 
money, or a big house. Other questions 
came lip as well. What will you wanr to 
leave for your children and grandchildren? 
Or why do we worry more about other 
countries while ignoring the problems in 
our 
backyard? 
Once a student said to me, 
"Trees produce oxygen 
and we need oxygen. So trees 
are good. But there 
ain't no trees where I live. 
How come we keep 
worrying about raintrees 
in Brazil and not the trees 
where we are?"

worryin'

Brazil and not the 
trees where we 
are?" 
•Action: As our youth program 
progresses, we work with students to 
develop strategies for translating problems 
into solutions. After students learned about 
the impact of illegal dumping in the 
Chesapeake Bay, they visited a site where 
dumping had taken place. They responded 
by calling city officials to inform them of 
the problems. At the same time, they 
suggested possible solution to city 
representatives and went to clean the site 
themselves. Last week, students and city 
employees finally completed a clean-up of 
the area. 


Finally, we must develop programs that 
put rhese partnerships, information, and 
skills to work. 


These four principles read like a simple 
recipe. But underlying them, an integrated 
effective 
framework 
for 
an 
environmental activism must coordinate 
social, economic, and ecological issues. To 
mobilize action, however, we will fail if we 
assume responsibility solely as individuals 
or we try to force responsibility as 
government. Success requires creating a 
movement that pervades communities, 
business, non-profits, government, and 
universities. I envision it would be 
something akin to what Arlo Guthrie sang 
in "Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacre 
Movement:" "If one person walks in and 
sings 'You can get anything you want at 
Alice's Restaurant,' they'll think he's 
crazy. If fifty 
people a day 
walk in singing 
a bar of Alice's 
Restaurant, they 
might think it's a 
movement. And 
that's what it will 
be: a movement." 


In 
all 
sertousness, we 
can 
construct 
such a movement 
if we choose to 
learn from the 
legacy and lessons 
of our past and 
present. Ten years ago, when I was an 
undergraduate, Yale lacked any campus-
wide environmental movement of 
consequence. Awareness of and appreciation 
for environmental action has certainly 
grown on campus since then. Today, our 
challenge is to learn effective stategies for 
action. It's something we, as a university of 
students, faculty, and alumni can do lauly. 
It's something that we should do lately. 


URI and the university are nor the whole 
answer. Over time, as we leave the 
university context, we will all have to decide 
what comributions we will make.
