EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I'm staring at Harold Bloom. Stacks of 
books surround him. Sweat beads on his 
forehead. The revered Yale professor and 
literary theorist looks mildly annoyed by 
the sun's heat and the dust from the 
construction behind him. He sits cross-legged, wearing a suit and tie, in the 
middle of the Grand Canyon. Clearly this 
is not my English 207 seminar. My eyes 
stay flXed on his, and I laugh out loud. 

I am at the Museum of Fine Arts in 
Boston, viewing an exhibit of paintings by 
Mark Tansey. As an artist and a thinker, 
Tansey wallows in the 
depths of theory. 
To 
understand his work, you 
must understand hi's vast 
knowledge of literature, art, 
and philosophy, his sense of 
humor, and his WheeL 
(1990). The Wheel is 
actually three wheels, 
the 
inner 
containing 
grammatical subjects, the 
middle encompassing verbs, and the outer 
listing objects. The words and phrases 
draw from the language of critical and 
theoretical literature. Spin the wheel and 
you can get "Derrideans encountering 
uncontrolled metaphor" or "Dialecticians 
updating lexical lacuna." (There are 
5,832,000 possible combinations.) 

Tansey's paintings put a new spin on 
historical artistic themes. In Triumph of the 
New York School (1984), he dresses 
Frenchmen Andre Breton and Henri 
Matisse, among others, in World War 1 
uniforms and depicts them surrendering to 
World War II era Americans, namely 
Clement Greenberg, Jackson Pollock, and 
Robert Motherwell. The composition 
portrays a typical battle scene, complete 
with tanks, artillery, and exploding bombs. 
A classic Tansey work-unexpected, yet 
amusing if you get it. It shouldn't be too 
extraordinary, then, to encounter Harold 
Bloom at the bottom of the Grand 
Canyon. 

Yale has turned out more than a few 
influential artists-Ciaes Oldenburg, 
Martin Puryear, Maya Lin, Richard Serra. 
But Harold Bloom may be the first Yale 
critic immortalized as the influence, so to 
speak, for a painting. 

Constructing the Grand Canyon ( 1990) 
presents Tansey's vision of deconstruction, 
realized in oil paint on an overwhelming 
expanse of canvas. Harold Bloom is not 
the only one there. Behind him, several 
men build a teepee. One man holds a "Y" 
flag alluding to the "Yale school" of 
criticism. Buffalo watch the scene from 
afar and mules transport debris. Yale's 
celebrated Paul DeMan labors there too, 
carting a wheelbarrow 
across the canyon floor. 

French critics Michel 
Foucault, Jacques Derrida, 
and Roland Barthes join 
them as well. Foucault 
perches precariously on the 
top of a bluff. All of the 
men struggle with various 
tools, hacking, mining, 
pulling 
away 
at 
boulders of the Grand Canyon. The 
canyon is actually made of silk-screened 
text, the boulders constructed of words. 
The men pry apart the canyon's fault lines, 
searching for meaning, but encountering 
only more layers of textualized sediment. 
No 
cushy 
lit 
seminars 
here. 

Deconscructing this text requires hard 
physical labor, not exactly the picture of 
refined intellectual pursuits. 

Tansey's absurdism humanizes his 
subjects. Bloom's stern face seems destined 
for immortalization in the rows of stone-
faced portraits that line residential college 
dining halls. But Tansey lets us laugh. 
Constructing the Grand Canyon spells out 
the paradox of deconstruction-far from 
filling in the gaps, it merely digs the hole 
deeper. Harold Bloom may loom large ilt 
Yale, but in Tansey's painting he is 
dwarfed by the canyon he helped create.
