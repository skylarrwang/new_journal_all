EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
But part of Melrose's multifarious appeal lies in the way that it invites community. You can't watch it alone-that would be contrary to the Melrose Place ethos. Even if we fans spout shallow, cacty, and over-intellectualized comments at the screen while we watch, we do so together. For us, MP means quality time.

Michael, Jane, and Sydney may well represent the complete meltdown of family values ("Honestly, Sydney ... "). Fine. But somehow, Spelling's silly sun-drenched apartment complex feels like a family. Incestuous? Very. Dysfunctional? Of course-this is the '90s. But when the stalker came after Amanda a few weeks ago, Jo and Alison put aside their anger (she slept with their boyfriends, but so what?) and helped her torture him. And it's not just the Melrose women who know about real friendship: Jake may have decked Billy at his engagement party for sleeping with Amanda, but the very next week they worked things out and enjoyed some great male-bonding. So even though someone attempts murder in the season finale, Melrose remains one big happy family.

More importantly, it's just like Sesame Street, the show we all sat and watched together when we were little. Amanda, Matt, and Hillary have a lot in common with Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, and the late Mr. Hooper, respectively. Every time we watch, there they are, predictable and pre-scripted in a familiar residential setting.

"Who are the people in your neighborhood?" Once they were the grocer, the crossing guard, and the nurse. We're older now, and "the people who we meet when we're walking down the street" look a lot like Billy and Alison, with a little bit of Sydney thrown in for good measure. Today's letter is C ... for condom. Our show today is brought to you by the number 8 and Miller Genuine Draft. We're jaded young viewers, but we still need a familiar address to call home. We're mass-culture cynics, but we still hunger for community by the television's flickering light. First we wanted our mommies to find Channel 13, then we wanted our MTV. Does it really surprise anyone that we now want Melrose so badly?

I called him pathetic at first, but maybe jmiller@connected.com had it right, asking for directions to our favorite fictional locale: say, I'm going to L.A. soon ... Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Melrose Place?

[Author's note: A long summer has passed since I gathered my notes. Everything has changed. MP is moving to Monday nights, its slot filled by a slick spin-off, Models Inc., which tells the tawdry tales of the "girls" who work at Hillary's modeling agency. Don't ask me what I think of it-I couldn't bear to watch without my Wednesday night posse.]
