I 
am standing in a men's room, sweating. Outside my stall, 
two men are performing an elaborate courrship dance. One 
of them paces, while the other stands by the urinals, not 
peeing. I think they are waiting for me to leave, but my feet 
seem nailed to the floor. Reality begins to warp, and for a 
moment I think, I'm short and flat-chested-if I just walk out 
there, maybe they'll think I'm a boy. How did I get myself into 
this? 

feminism. Too bad it was confined to this all-female underground 
den. But at least it was happening somewhere. 

Later I discovered the tangles of graffiti written by people 
srudying (or not) in the stacks, and my interest in these silent 
conversations, or what graffiti scholar Richard Reisner calls 
"significant statements by the anonymous," grew. Finally one day 
last spring I set out on a quest to uncover these "little peepholes, 
little insights onto the minds of individuals who are spokesmen 
not only for themselves but for others like them." 

It all started about a year ago when I 
began to notice the conversations taking 
place in installments on the walls of a 
Cross Campus Library women's room. 
Alongside the standard So-and-So is hot 
appeared debates about date rape, 
friendship between men and women, the 
persistence of double-standards, childhood 
sexual abuse, body image, and counseling: 

Graffitology remains a fledgling 
science, but graffiti itself dates from 
prehistory, beginning with the Neolithic-
Age finger paintings found in caves 
throughout Europe. Scholars postulate 
that the depictions of animals may have 
served as charms of an ancient hunting 
magic. Other designs look like the 
senseless doodling of bored cavemen. 

Fast-forward now to the time of Christ. When Mount 
Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79, the lava preserved walls inscribed 
with insults, political slogans, praise for actors and gladiators, 
love letters, gossip, and quotations from Virgil and Ovid. These 
casual graffiti provide historians with intimate glimpses of the 
people's thoughts. And when I was in fourth grade, 
they provided me with an epiphany. During a 
filmstrip about the destruction of Pompeii, the 
narrator quoted a few examples of the graffiti, 
including, hopk who wriu on walls ar~ stupid. 

In his article "The Walls Speak," translator Antonio Varone 
brings to light the adult version of Pompeiian graffiti. When the 
walls speak, they say loud and clear: the more things change, the 
more people stay the same. In fact, many Yale graffitists could 
trace their literary ancestries to the anonymous bards of 
Pompeiian banality:

If Pompeiian graffiti 
offers a cultural history 
in relief-what wasn't 
said or done .in polite 
company, what was 
politically dangerous, 
how many Phrygians it 
took to screw in a 
torch-then why not 
take a look at our own 
mini-culture through 
that same rear window? 

Modern 
graffiti 
represents a final frontier, challenging us to stretch the limits of 
taboo in a culture grown blase on a steady diet of daytime t.v. 
about animal fetishists, crossdressing Klansmen, bedwetting 
husbands. What is worth saying under cover of anonymity 
anymore, when privacy has become such a public affair? What 
can the graffiti of a place really tell us about its inhabitants 
anyway, and what does Yale graffiti say about Yalies that Yalies 
can't openly say for themselves? 

Suppose one day the Physical Plant finally erupted, burying 
us all under a blanket of deadly ash. When the archaeologists of 
the 22nd century dug up our wall writings, what would they
