Summer does strange things to Yalies. We wax nostalgic for even the most subtle textures of 
life in New Haven: the Wa, three a.m. street sweepings, Woodchuck Cider on tap. Three 
months of relaxing and well-paid internships can make even Orgo Lab and the lines at the 
Bursar's Office sound appealing. 

We didn't realize it at first, but summer has made us miss theory, something we take for granted 
at Yale but which "the real world" lacks-and even scorns. (Those overqualified interns who can 
perform epistemological analyses of Henry V while Xeroxing purchase orders learn quickly not to 
discuss these thoughts with their employers.) Who could have imagined this rather embarrassing 
sentiment in the dog days of May? Not us. 

So when Kate Schuler spotted Harold Bloom at the bottom of 
the Grand Canyon in a Mark Tansey painting a few weeks ago, she 
was shocked by the depth of her feelings. There sat Mr. Theory 
himself, looking typically rumpled, reminding her of the joys of 
literary analysis. 

Rosemary Hutzler had a similar experience as she assembled her 
notes on Yale graffiti-the fumbling for the familiar language of 
analysis to explain the unexpected. Was it Foucault who wrote about 
reading a culture by what it hides, or was it Said? Never mind: 
language just points to a lack anyway. 

Twelve years ago, Geoff Hayward and Tom Feigelson developed a 
theory to explain the grotesque sense of humor that inspired Yale's gargoyles. We have revived their 
story under the rubric "Vintage Voice," our newest standard. The theory behind the addition: our 
archives deserve to be shared. 

Sometimes hungry critics lost in the wilderness must sustain themselves on the most banal and 
juvenile of entertainments: witness Jay Porter's account of widespread attempts to make meaning 
from the televised misadventures of morally challenged Angelinos and huge yellow birds. 

Suzanne Kim's review of Charlie Chan is Dead provides richer reminders of the beauty and 
power of theory in action. The anthology of new Asian-American fiction shatters simpleminded 
stereotypes and replaces them with fresh images. The writers employ shock and anti-nostalgia, 
working to reclaim the symbols of oppression. At least those are the words Yale has given us to 
describe their iconoclastic efforts. 

By Thanksgiving, theory is easy to come by and hard to forget. We may groan about literary 
jargon when the time comes to write final papers, but for now we're content to make up for lost 
time and enjoy the company of a sorely missed friend.
