Ethnic Studies: Ghetto or Glue? 
Will increasing Yale's commitment to blue-book diversity isolate 
minority scholars or promote common-ground culture? 
D 
ay one of a seminar in Latino-American social policy: a 
dozen students sit around a table. They glance around 
and shuffle their papers. A professor walks to the front 
of the room and begins his introductory remarks. For a 
moment, the room stops in silent surprise-a dozen mouths hang 
open. The students had assumed the teacher would be Latino-
American-how often does a non-Hispanic scholar pursue study in 
Latino-American affairs? 


Increasingly, students press for more classes that focus on the 
cultural experiences of diverse racial, ethnic, and religious groups. 
one of a srring of disappointing policies. "The couple of meetings 
we had seemed just talk to appease the complaints," comments 
Maricella Ramirez (ES '96), president of el Movimiento Estudantil 
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA). "I appreciate the effort, but I'm 
extremely disappointed with the results," says Mary Li Hsu, 
assistant dean of Yale College and coordinator of Asian-American 
affairs. 


Compared to other schools, Yale lags behind in minority 
faculty representation. In 1990-1991, Harvard conducted a 
confidential survey on minority representation in "comparable 
Simultaneously, Yale's administration 
struggles to confront growing student, 
alumni, and faculty concern over the lack of 
minority scholars on campus. Ethnic studies 
"We know that there is 
universities." Yale ranked eleventh out of 17 
in tenured minority faculty, and fifteenth out 
of 16 in term-time minority faculty. 


According to Valeriano Ramos, assistant dean 
and coordinator of Puerto-Rican Affairs, Yale 
has no Chicano-American or Puerto-Rican 
American faculty, while University of 
and 
minority 
representation 
seem 
inextricably linked. Student discussion of one 
topic often spills over into the other. 


Expressing this link in terms of concrete 
university policy has proven complex, but as 
frustration grows over slow change in the 
ethnic diversity of Yale's faculty, ethnic 
studies programs continue to gain support as

associate provost 
Arlene McCord. "What

a partial solution. 
that generally means 
gets a little muddy." 


Last year, Yale offered positions to at least 
four minority scholars; only one accepted. 


Why do promising candidates turn down 
Across the country, minority scholars 
have become highly sought-after commodities, and Yale loses many 
of these candidates to other schools. Current efforts to boost 
minority representation in the Yale faculty run the gamut, 
depending on departmental policy, from making a few phone calls 
to conducting extensive searches for qualified minority candidates. 


Yale administrators, however, boast a considerable commitment to 
minority recruitment. "We want to make sure that if any hiring 
practices in the university fail to equally consider minorities, [we 
will] make them absolutely cease," says Richard Brodhead, Dean of 
Yale College. Arlene McCord, Associate Provost of Yale College, 
adds that the Provost's Office has been making the best possible 
monetary offers to draw candidates, but potential faculty reject Yale 
for otherreasons. 


The university created the Minority Advisory Council to 
investigate the problems of low minority 
representation. But members of the Cou-ncil 
describe it as ineffective and irrelevant, seeing it as

Yale? One of the four, Henry Yoon, a 
Chinese-American who specializes in Asian-American history, says 
he took a post at Berkeley partially due to Yale's lack of a tenure 
track. Such "pipeline issues" pose a structural hindrance to 
increasing minority faculty. Yale, as an elite institution, tends to 
seek leading scholars who are established in their fields, rather than 
promoting from within. 


Among <he factors that impede Yale's progress toward better 
minority representation is the absence of a significant community 
of minority scholars. And without this critical mass, Yale may seem 
unattractive or unwelcoming to minority candidates. The current 
situation also loads onto the few minority faculry the burden of 
special responsibilities, from counseling minority students to 
serving on minority committees. "Any time any kind of minority 
issue appears in a publication, I get quoted and therefore people 
tend to think of me on those terms," says Gerald 
Jaynes, chair of African-American Studies. "I think 
some people would shy away from that."

THE UNDE~URRICULUM 
Jaynes has become an expert on this 
topic. In 1992, a faculty group he 
chaired produced the "First Report of 
the Presidenr's Commiuee to Monitor 
the Recruitment and Retention of 
Disabled, Minority, and Women 
Faculty" (the Jaynes Report). In 
contrast 
to 
prior 
university investigations into minority 
representation, the Jaynes committee 
did not confine itself to traditional 
affirmative action strategies. Rather, 
they suggested approaches that would 
tackle subtleties involved in critical 
mass and pipeline issues.

C
an ethnic studies succeed as a 
mechanism for improving minority 
representation at Yale? Proponents 
of such a link tout the African-American 
studies department as evidence, as the 
overwhelming majority of African-
American professors on campus have 
joined that ethnic studies program. 


American minority scholars are not 
confined to ethnically-related fields of 
study; nor are whites excluded from them. 


The majority of professors in ethnic 
studies, however, do come from ethnic 
groups. According to Ann Fabian, 
professor of American studies and acting 
chair of the ethnic studies steering 
committee, last year's two top candidates 
for Chicano studies happened to be 
Chicano-American, and the Asian-
American studies candidates happened to 
be Asian-American. 


As in these cases, most scholars choose 
a field of study closely associated with their 
backgrounds. Jaynes writes in his 1991 
article, "OnJy Blacks Need Apply," in the 
journal Ruomtruction, "At present, and 
probably for some period into the future, 
the majority of competently trained 
African Americanists are and will be 
black .... Surely, any school whose African

American studies program is dominated by

of discriminating against blacks." 


The specter of ghettoization hangs over 
ethnic studies. The argument goes that if 
Yale recruits minority scholars specifically 
to serve in its ethnic studies programs, the 
minorities hired might find themselves 
limited to studying only ethnic issues. 


Their obligations to their respective ethnic 
studies programs could inhibit their 
interaction in broader inter- and intra-
departmental discourse. As a result, ethnic 
studies programs would spawn ethnic 
"ghettos" separated from the rest of the 
faculty and students. For fear of such a

scenario, Kang-i Sun Chang, professor of 
Chinese literature and chair of East Asian 
Languages and Literatures, resists the link 
between ethnic studies and minority 
represemation. "I rhink it is much better 
for minority people to focus on unity and 
similarity," she says. 


Those with experience in ethnic studies 
programs dismiss such qualms about 
ghettoization. Advocates do not by any 
means envision a policy of hiring only 
minorities for ethnically related fields. Such 
a policy would prove detrimental to the 
legitimacy and quality of these programs.

"People use the phrase 'ghetto' but about 
half our African-American studies faculty 
is white," says Jaynes. "We hire the best 
person." However, Jaynes elaborates in 
"Only Blacks Need Apply": "Under 
pressure to increase the number of black 
faculty, and often acutely aware that large 
segments of the university are either 
indifferent or resistant to the efforts to seek 
out and hire minority professors, they 
accede to exclusively black hiring in 
African American studies and sometimes 
tacitly promote it." 


This view brings up the hotly 
contested controversy over whether 
deliberate minority recruitment-that is, 
overt affirmative action-is a valid 
practice. Ethnic studies provides a 
convenient way to recruit more minority 
faculty without dealing with the 
controversy of giving special priority to 
minorities in hiring. 


But Associate Provost McCord, 
who is Japanese 
American, denies 
such an effect: "All

studies.

American 
studies." She says 
the 
Provost's 
office has never 
discussed 
issue, but she 
believes 
other 
officials would 
share her position. 


The proposed 
link may not seem 
ideologically 
sound 
in 
abstract, but in 
reality, it may 
provide a solution. "In the ideal academy 
all ethnic groups are broadly represented 
everywhere; however, right now, there is a 
large connection of ethnic minorities with 
their [respective] ethnic studies," says 
Professor Ann Fabian. Jaynes adds, 
"Opponents mish-mash principle with 
practical argument. Certainly in principle, 
anyone ought to be able to teach any 
subject. My argument is that things don't 
stand where everything works according to 
principle."

says that Yale can not develop any new -i 
programs without thinking about the 
whole of the university. "The students who
