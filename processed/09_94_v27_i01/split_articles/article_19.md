EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Wednesday night in the basement of Sr. Anthony Hall, a literary 
discussion society. Fox Night also happens to be Bar Night: the 
taps flow, the room gradually fills with ten to twenty members and 
their friends, and the tension rises as 90210 draws to a close (hard-
core Melrose watchers tend to look down on ZIP fans). This 
Wednesday night is no different. The fact that finals begin in three 
days seems inconsequential. Classes here clearly take a back seat to 
the show-so much so that one of my professors decided not to 
offer Wednesday night discussion sections because he didn't want 
to compete. 

But this doesn't mean we don't value our education-watching 
Melrose doubles as an academic experience. My friends are 
generally the type who 'never go to the library but still ace the 
final, all caffeine and glib inspiration and not a little bullshit. The 
same holds true in the way we watch Melrose. We all have our 
agendas, our little theoretical specialries. Elizabeth looks for the 
economic underpinnings of the show; Grant scrutinizes its medical 
aspects, so important of late; Sara concentrates on gender roles 
and sexual dynamics from an ardently feminist point of view; 
Chris denounces bad clothes, bad hair, and bad acting; I listen for 
the well-tuned line of dialogue and monitor plot developments 
involving Matt, the show's token fag. And we do all of this out 
loud in real-time, every week, without fail-barring reruns. 

This particular week's show evoked quite a response from my 
Melrose posse. Here's a handy summary of major plot twists, with 
apologies to Soap Opera Digest: Dr. Kimberly returned from the 
dead (sort of) to reclaim her true love-the smugly perfidious Dr. 
Michael Mancini-from the Donna Reed/Heidi Fleiss-wannabe 
clutches of Sydney, the little sister of Michael's long-suffering ex-

wife Jane. 

When he kicks Sydney out, she begs sister Jane to put her up 
for a night. Jane's response: "Honestly Sydney, I'd rather set fire to 
myself" When Sydney sees Melrose's sickly sweet Billy and Alison, 
she sneers, ''I'm getting a divorce ... and so will you someday." But 
we doubt they'll even marry, because Billy (the dramatically 
challenged Andrew Shue} isn't contracted for next season and 
Alison suffers from semi-repressed memories of childhood sexual 
abuse set to explode as her father gives her away. 

The ever-chubby Jo is getting chubbier, but tonight we're 
betting that she loses the baby sired by her drug-running ex-
boyfriend Reed, whom she had to blow away (in self-defense) a 
few weeks back. She'll probably get back together with Jake; 
Amanda doesn't appreciate his studliness, and it's time for her to 
move on anyway, probably with the fiance of her long lost mother 
(played by Linda Grey of Dallas fame). In other news, we saw 
Matt working at the hospital ... still no sex for him. Not even a 
lousy on-screen kiss. 

At any rate, we all had opinions about what we saw. As soon as 
the credits ended, our reverent silence shattered and it became 
hard to hear the show over the laugh, cheer, and critique track. 
"You suck!" yells Chris violently as Amanda walks on screen 
early in the show. "Why do I hate her?" 

I shrug. "She has dark roots. Do you think she's hot?" 

"She looks o.k.," confides Chris, "but the entire show has ~

hair problems." 

I nod in agreement. Soon the action 
shifts to Michael's seaside home, outside 
the buff stucco walls of Melrose Place. 
'Thunderstorm motif at the beach house ... 
there's something brewin'," notes Grant in 
his Texas drawl. He's right: Kimberly is 
lurking in the shadows-she jumps out, 
scares Michael, and elicits a group scream. 
Sara groans and shakes her head. 
"Normal people call," she says flatly. But 
Sara likes Kimberly: she's vaguely feminist, 
definitely back with a vengeance. When 
Kimberly tells Michael to "get rid of" 
Sydney, Sara sounds genuinely impressed. 
"That's beautiful delivery. Really nice." 

When Linda Grey appears, I am 
momentarily cheered (I know who shot 
J.R.), but she looks a little too plausible as 
Amanda's mother Hillary, too far above the 
Melrose age cap. Sara apparently feels the 
same way, and puts a very fine point on it. 
"Linda Grey got a facelift, but she didn't 
get her neck fixed. Look at all that flesh." 
Fearing that we haven't heard her, she 
grimaces and repeats this rather gruesome 
observation once again. 

During a commercial, I ponder why we 
love Melrose so much, forsaking all other 
shows. A consensus quickly develops. 
"There's so much more hard-core 
scandal on this show than 90210," says 
Grant. 
"Clearly," adds Sara; Chris 
concurs. "Totally." 

Chris then launches into the litany of 
the work he has coming up, then admits to 
thinking the unthinkable: skipping a week. 
''I'm glad I made the right choice. Actually, 
the only choice." We all nod. 

There is plenty of filler this week 
alongside the real story of Kimberly's 
return, but we can sense the show building 
toward a big ending. Elizabeth, who has 
32 
already made several shrewd observations 
this evening, keeps asking about 
Kimberly's hair. "Didn't they shave it off in 
the hospital? Like, major head trauma? 
Remember? Did it just all grow back in 
two months?" Elizabeth is not quite in the 
inner circle of Melrose addicts, so we don't 
listen too closely-to our peril. If we had 
heard her out, the final scene wouldn't 
have been so upsetting. 

With five minutes left in the show, 
Kimberly dismounts Michael after a 
rather randy scene and goes to the 
bathroom. She winces (a headache?), 
takes some pills and then- wham!-she 
peels off this wig and reveals an inch of 
what can only be described as stubbly 
chemo-patient hair and a tremendous 
scar! 

We all scream. Loud. The rest of us 
have stopped, but there sits Chris in the 
corner, still wailing, with a look of sheer 
terror on his face. "Sick! That's just so 
sick!" he sputters, and then screams some 
more. By this point, a beer commercial 
has replaced Kimberly and her "major 
head trauma"; Elizabeth accepts kudos for 
her dead-on prediction. "Thank you, 
thank you," she says, bowing hammishly. 

By now, Chris is completely pale and 
speechless. He will remain so all through 
"scenes from next week," the all-
important teaser for the upcoming 
exciting episode. By the end of "scenes," 
as we call it, we are already outlining next 
week's major plot points. 

We talk about the show for 20 or 30 
minutes after it ends: definitely one of the 
best ever. Someone comments that 
sensationalizing Kimberly's medical 
problems shows a lack of sensitivity, and 
we all agree. But we also agree that her 
scar is gross anyway. We move on to a 
review of the acting. Linda Grey seems 
o.k. (the neck notwithstanding}, but Billy 
has hit a new low with a mangled line 
about a lamb kebab. We proceed to 
savage him: definitely the worst actor on 
Melrose, maybe the dumbest on t.v. Cathy 
leaps to his defense: "Billy's not dumb," 
she steadfastly declaims. "He's just ... 
slow." We leave her to her illusions. Soon 
we disperse and return to our work. 

Chris, exhausted by the whole experience, 
decides to call it a night and hit the sack. 

If my friends fail to provide enough 
commentary, I have other methods. I 
can only watch Melrose for an hour a 
week, but I can dial up the alt.tv.melrose-
place news group on the Internet 24 hours 
a day. It's serious business. People from all 
over the world post little articles about the 
show. Hundreds of little articles a week. 
Some 
of 
them 
pose 
simple 
questions wanting an answer: "When was 
Heather Locklear born?" "How old is 
Amanda supposed to be on the show?" 

Some of the little articles (or "posts") 
want more; some verge on the pathetic. 
"jmiller@connected.com" posted this 
message recently: "I am planning a trip to 
L.A. in May and thought it would be fun 
to see the actual apartment complex where 
all the trouble we love to watch on 
Wednesdays takes place. Is the apartment 
actually located in L.A.? Would someone 
be willing to give a full address and/or 
directions to get to it?" Really, Jim. It's 
called a set. They film the show on a 
sound stage in Santa Clarita-not even 
Hollywood. 

If you read a post that interests you, 
you could post a response yourself. Or, 
more privately, you can reply to a post by 
e-mailing the person who posted the 
article. I have actually done this, an act 
which marks me as having a particularly

severe Melrose addiction. The writer, one 
Thomas 
Andrew 
Jourgenson 
at 
columbia.edu, described Billy's bursting 
into Alison's creepy shrink's office as 
"loping in there like Rambo without his 
jockstrap." I laughed. He also noticed 
Mancini's new and unflattering haircut, and 
railed about his artificially prolonged 
celibacy. I had found a kindred spirit. 

With a mind toward this article, I sent him 
a message asking about his Melrose 
experience. 

The response was amazing: Andrew's 
description was a ringer for mine. "I 
"Who are the 
people in your 
neighborhood?" 
Once they were the 
grocer, the crossing 
guard, and the nurse. 
Now they look a lot 
like Billy and Alison. 
watch the full Fox Wednesday lineup in 
the basement of River Hall, a Columbia 
dorm. Anywhere from ten to twenty-five 
people show up on Wednesdays, and you 
have to be early to guarantee a good seat. I 
watch with my friends, several of whom I 
became friends with primarily because they 
were regulars. We comment on the show, 
but the close surroundings and the 
importance we occasionally place upon 
hearing the dialogue requires a certain 
decorum. Not quite sotto voce, but 
screaming is only tolerated when the 
happenings turn egregious.... Long 
rambles are appreciated only during 
station breaks, especially if they're loud." 

Andrew and his friends sound more polite 
than me and mine. 

It turns out that Andrew is a humor 
columnist for the Columbia Daily 
Spectator; it shows. "Matt seems to be a 
celibate island in a sea of promiscuity. I 
think it's time for Spelling to bridge the 
sea, or, for a particularly tasteless kicker to 
this metaphor, start running a ferry 
service. 
thought that Andrew (as a 
philosophy major) might be able to help 
me figure out why people like us-
otherwise sane and well-adjusted college 
students-succumb to this particularly 
bizarre show. He finds it as hard to explain 
as I do. "I guess the characters could be 
role models," he muses, "if one was 
looking to blackmail employers, break up 
relationships, run with drug dealers, et 
cetera. Currently, the closest person to a 
role model is Matt, who's so marginalized 
that he might as well be written in ball-
point pen. Alison is only now starting to 
perk up interest now that it's being made 
clear that she's more neurotic than Philip 
Roth mixing nitrous oxide and Zoloft. . . 
Role models don't make for dynamic 
characters on soap operas." And our 
Melrose alter egos are nothing if not 
dynamic. 

Buoyed by my e-mail encounter with 
Andrew, I sent a message to a friend of 
mine who goes to Duke. The scene there 
looks very much the same: everyone 
watches en masse, and snide comments 
reign. With Justin Dillon, I really hit the 
jackpot: he watches both 90210 and 
Melrose. "Okay, I admit it," he wrote back. 
"I am hooked on the 
shallow, pathetic, sex-
crazed lives of those 
little bastards who are 
no longer at that 
fucking ZIP code and 
those slightly bigger 
bastards who live in 
that 
incestuous 
apartment complex." 

Justin 
and 
I 
discussed the show 
more over the next 
week. "I watch it 
basically to mock it, 
but it has occasional 
redeeming points. I 
don't see it as the voice 
of my generation any 
more than 90210, as both are unrealistic 
portrayals of largely one-sided characters 
who represent some particular stereotype." 

My quest to ascribe any sort of social 
meaning to it somewhat disturbed him. "It 
scares me that anyone could EVER identify 
with the show or actually gain edification 
from it. I shudder to think that our world 
and value system have devolved to that 
level.'' 

This last note left me unsettled: is my 
concern about Melrose much ado about 
nothing, 
or 
does 
"the 
Melrose 
phenomenon" (as Cathy calls it) mean 
something? Jason Rogart, a Brown 
freshman whom I met on the Net, believes 
that Melrose is just average, escapist fare. 
"Being on the East Coast, I guess I also 
wish that I was living the life of Billy, 
Jake, or one of the other Melrose guys 
because their lives seem so easy and laid-
back. I think this escape from reality into a 
different life is the biggest reason why 
college students all over the country are 
addicted." 

Maybe Justin and Jason are right. 
Maybe we just watch to mock, to relieve 
the pressures of college life, to fantasize 
about our day in the sun that may come 
after graduation. Andrew graduated this 
spring and-surprise-hopes to go to 
California: proof positive that Melrose can 
change your life.
