Change of Address 
The shows may change, but Generation X co nti nues to build commu nity 
around t elevision. Big Bird, meet Heather Locklear. 

I 
am a child of television. I realize now that nothing can 
change this. No amount of wit, intelligence, or hard work can 
ever rewire my synapses-not even my nearly complete Yale 
education. As a group of my friends and I sit in the basement 
t.v. room of my favorite haunt, l realize that we are in touch with 
our primal consciousness. By 
the phosphor light of the Sony, 
waiting for the credits to roll, 
we all stay quiet for a brief 
moment. We might as well be 
four again, eating Nilla wafers, 
sitting in Mommy's lap, waiting 
for the cheery Sesame Strut 
theme song to begin. It's really 
the same thing-
the electronic 
baby-sitter, the television fix-
but we're rwenrysomething now, 
far from home, smoking 
Marlboros, and drinking beer, 
waiting for a slightly more 
upscale address to appear on the 
screen. 

I noticed recently that no matter where rwenrysomethings 
gather, we tend to play chercher Ia t!ll as soon as we arrive. 
We don't have to watch to be comforted; we just like to 
know it's there-
unlike our preoccupied parents 
and pha~tom social security deposits. In bars, we 
catch ghmpses our of the corner of our eyes. 
When parries get boring, I often nocice 
people staring longingly at the blank face of 
rhe nearest set. Last year some friends went on 
a bud~et ~pri~g-break vacation_ to th: Bahamas; 
they dado t mmd the roaches 10 theu seedy hotel 
room, but the lack of a t.v. provoked a crisis. The 
botrom line: wherever we go, whatever else happens, we 
want our MTV-and ESPN, CNN, and of course, our Fox. 
Melrose Piau is another titillating title in producer Aaron 
Spelling's impressively trashy <r:uvre, along with Charlie's Angels, 
Dynasty. Dallas, and Beverly Hills 90210. Together, 
90210 and Melrose constitute "Fox night," a block 
of time from eight to ten Wednesday night when 
life grinds to a halt, phones go unanswered, and all academic 
pursuits are put on hold by untold numbers of college students 
around the country. As the Bev Hills kids grew up and graduated, 
Wednesday night began to wane in popularity. Melrose didn't 
atrain cult status until this year, its second season, when the 
original cast was beefed up by 
Amanda (Heather Locklear) and 
Sydney (Lara Leighton)-and a 
series of frenetic plot twists 
involving murder, blackmail, 
prostitution, and a little sex. 
Countless headlines and 
magazine cover stories later, 
Melrose Place is "the hottest 
address on television," as USA 
Today recently crowed; it has 
helped to elevate Fox ro major-
network status. Beyond the 
numbers (which are probably low 
anyway because Neilsen doesn't 
include college students in irs 
calculations), Melrose 
is 
a 
phenomenon, almost a religion. But don't lump us MP faithful 
with soap-opera sob sisters or Star Trek losers. We're different, a 
little too jaded to take the whole thing seriously. But addicted 
we are, brazen in our helplessness if a little sheepish about 
it, too. Everyone has an excuse. "My roommates got me 
hooked." "I started watching 90210, and by the time 
Melrose came on it was roo late for me to stop." "I 
have a melodrama dependency, but my 
insurance won,t cover treatment." 

Only the seriously pathetic watch 
Melrose alone-for most of us Fox Night is a 
social event. We show off our chic cynicism, flirt 
with the person next to us by trashing a favorite 
character, and strive to outdo each other with our plot 
predictions. In our college t.v. rooms, we form nice little 
communities that mirror the big scary one that lives at Melrose 
Piau. 

My Yale Melrosefriends provide my basic frame 
of reference for the show. We assemble every 
We all have our agendas, our little 
theoretical specialties. 
Elizabeth looks for the economic 
underpinnings Of the show; 
Grant scrutinizes its medical 
aspects; Sara concentrates on 
gender roles and sexual dynamics; 
Chris denounces bad clothes, bad 
hair, and bad acting.
