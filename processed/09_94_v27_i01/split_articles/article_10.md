20 l 0. One would expect faculty outrage 
that Yale does not offer programs that study 
issues dealing with significant populations of 
ethnic minorities. If Yale did not, for some 
reason, offer courses in French history, the 
faculty would not restrain their anger simply 
because the many courses in Spanish and 
British history would somehow compensate. 
The presence or absence of ethnic 
studies boils down to a matter of minority 
culture representation not only in the 
faculty but also in the curriculum. In a 
welcoming speech to the Yale College Class 
of 1994, Donald Kagan, professor of classics 
and history and then Dean of Yale College, 
suggested that Western culture alone could 
hold together all the diversity in America. "I 
think his premise is correct. We need some 
sort of glue," says Jaynes, "but I don't see 
European studies as a glue for the United 
States. The study of American civilization is 
that glue. This civilization is by definition 
something that has been made by all these 
people and cultures." 

Aside from attracting minority scholars 
who specialize in ethnic fields, ethnic 
studies has the potential to encourage 
minorities to enter academic careers by 
providing role models. A vast majority of 
"mainstream" fields that do not specifically 
address ethnic issues actually center on 
European- American issues. To include the 
study of the culture, history, and 
demographic impact of American ethnic, 
racial, and religious minorities in academics 
makes the ivory tower more welcoming and 
attractive to minority students. Building 
ethnic studies can begin to balance a 
racially and ethnically skewed academic 
perspective that maintains institutional 
discrimination in an 
increasingly 
multicultural society. America has long 
educated its leaders from a limited 
European-American perspective; increased 
awareness of ethnic issues through ethnic 
studies will dilute the underlying 
discrimination that continues to plague 
America's academic institutions.
