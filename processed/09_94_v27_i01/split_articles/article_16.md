about it? 

Even at their most political, though, 
most of the scrawlings are little more than 
ripples of annoyance on the surface of a 
deep complacency. Where are the radicals? 
·I wonder. Where is the graffiti of action? 
With these questions in mind, I set out on 
the most adventurous leg of my journey, 
the search for larrinalia. (Yes, it's really a 
word.) 

Already familiar with a good deal of 
the graffiti in women's rooms on campus, 
I needed only confirm what I already 
knew: that women's larrinalia addresses 
three principal topics: 1) men-pigs or 
not pigs?; 2) how sweet it is to be a 
lesbian; and 3) eating disorders. 

When women write in bathrooms, we 
do not try to impress or shock. We follow 
the nurturing, collaborative model of 
social interaction. We are earnest and 
concerned. Our graffiti is pretty dull. 
(row of interlocking woman signs) 
Lesbians unite! 
Hey Freud, what happens now that 
women no longer need to sublimate? 
Question: Why do women get on another 
woman's case if she believes in the equality of 
the sexes and not that (woman sign) are 
better than (man sign)? 

Emboldened by the fantasy of myself 
as intrepid private eye, I pay a visit to a 
certain men's. room where a source has 
tipped me off to some primo graffiti. 
When the coast looks clear, I duck into 
the last stall and lock myself in. 
Immediately I stumble upon a great truth . 
of the universe: Men and women really 
are different. If you don't believe it, go see 
for yourself what the opposite sex thinks 
about on the toilet. 

SEPTEMBER 2, 1994


women's chree, men have one single, 
seemingly inexhauscible copic. A secrec spy 
in che land of guy calk, l revel in ics 
dirciness, Jiberaced from che shackles of 
good taste. I note several drawings of 
elephantine penises, perhaps signifying 
some kind of modern-day hunting magic, 
and locs of notes like these: 
1 0" ready to eat. 
Fags must DIE. I So must breeders and 
their offspring. Let's fuck "fast, ladies and 
gents. 
Is it true that many handsome men are 
gay? I 50% of the time yes, just Like me. 
I can't help feeling sorry for the guy 
who apparently mistook his stall for a 
library carrel and wrote, Systems of 
oppression are interlocking. The only road to 
Liberation is through a re'newed sense of 
group consciousness, in between Fags suck 
and Fat girls are in. 

When I finish in each stall, I peek 
under the door to make su.re no one is 
standing at the sinks or urinals, then dart 
into the next one. In stall number four I 
notice a panoply of little personals 
covering che walls: 
Hot Yale student looking for hot cock. 
Big, must be white. Tues, Nov. 30, 8:00 
here. Write me P.O. ---- . 
Gay male is looking for men who want a 
Bj. Call -------. This phone will be avail. 
Feb. 22. 

Lots of dates are being made, with 
various qualifications stipulated. Several 
specify race. One wants submissive jocks. 
A hung top seeks a bottom. I've heard of 
places like chis, known as· "tearooms," but 
this is my first real live visit to one. Still, I 
recognize some familiar signs ofYaleness. 
The pressures of a busy schedule: 
GWM, 20, seeks . .. I How about Mon 9-16 
at 6:45? I Can't make that. How about Wed 
9-18 at 1? I No, how about . .. 
The elitism: GWM ISO a Rhodes 
scholar. 

And chose famous interlocking systems 


of oppression: GBM ueks men (handsome 
+ young). He is an oral sex granted. I That's 
not a complete sentence, nigger. 

I'm ready to go on to the next stall, 
but when I peek out I see a couple of men 
standing at the sinks and urinals. As I wait 
for them to leave, I begin to notice a few 
things I had missed. There is a wad of 
toilet paper stuck in the latch, reminding 
me that I've seen other pieces of t.p. stuck 
to the walls of other stalls. What do they 
mean? I wonder. I try not to think about 
what's holding them up. 

The men seem to be taking an awfully 
long time. In fact, one is pacing back and 
forth, which seems strange, since there are 
plenty of empty stalls. I peek under. The 
pacer, who wears brown wing-tips and 
dress slacks, stops pacing. Another man, 
in sneakers and chinos, stands facing the 
urinal. Silence settles over the bathroom 
for a moment; then the pacing resumes. 
Wingtips goes to the paper towel 
dispenser and takes a lot of paper towels, 
throws them away, paces again, gets more 
towels. A signal? Then he walks to one of 
the stalls and stands halfway in, facing 
inwards, his briefcase on the floor beside 
him. A signal? 

I peek under again, and as I do, 
C hinos turns around toward me. I 
straighten up fast and break out in a sweat 
as the situation becomes suddenly clear. I 
review my options: 
explain 
that 
I'm here researching an article 
about bathroom graffiti, terribly sorry co 
intrude; 2) bolt and say nothing; 3) stay 
put. 

I determine to sic it out, literally. I feel 
dumb for not having caught on sooner, but 
not as dumb as the guy who scribbled, This 
school is so Lame. Where is ail the action? 


Eventually the men run out of patience and 
leave. But when I peek under again, 
another man is standing at the urinals, this 
time in straight-leg jeans and black leather 
shoes, like me. He washes his hands, gees 
paper towels, paces, gets more paper 
towels. A signal? To whom? He's the only 
one out there now. 

Imagine my surprise when he comes 
and stands in the stall next to mine, facing 
in. He stands there, tears off a bit of toilet 
paper, stands there some more, just stands 
there. Once again, a flash of insight: from 
the knees down, in my Doc Martens and 
frayed Levis, I am the picture of androgyny. 
I've been in here a long time, shuffling 
around, facing in various directions. Of 
course it looks like ... 

Picture it: this man wants to have sex 
with me, knowing so little about me that 
he hasn't figured out I'm the wrong sex. 
And 
you 
thought 
Demery's 
was 
impersonal. 

Once again I play the waiting game, 
and after a minute someone in grubby 
high-tops trudges by to use one of the 
toilets for its intended purpose. My pursuer 
takes off, leaving the escape route dear for 
me. I wait a couple beats and then bolt. 
But just outside the door, what should I see 
but those black shoes and straight-leg jeans, 
and in them a Timothy Dalton look-alike 
pretending to study a bulletin board. As I 
stride purposefully past, his eyes slide down 
to my shoes and make their 
way slowly up the rest of me, 
chen jump quickly back to 
the 
bulletin 
board. 
Hurrying away, I see his 
face crinkle into a look of 
sheer befuddlement. I feel 
guilty for the rest of the 
day. 

There must be a moral in here 
somewhere. Don't go ferreting out the 
furtive if you can't out-furt the ferrets. Or 
something like that. If you figure out what 
it is, write it on a wall somewhere. I'll be 
looking.
