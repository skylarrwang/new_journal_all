glean about our daily lives, the gods we 
worship, the cravings we long to fulfill? 
Prowling through the stacks of Sterling 
Memorial Library with my notebook and 
pencil 
after 
most 
people had had the 
good sense to leave for 
the summer, I felt like 
an archaeologist myself, 
poking through the 
ruins 
of 
a 
lost 
civilization. 


In 
fifth-floor 
carrel, someone gives 
him- or herself a grim 
little pep talk: 
I'm 
now 
sophomor~. It's th~ md of 
1st stm~sttr. I fail~d th~ 
samt math courst for tht 
ucond tim~. But I will 
talu it again, this timt 
with th~ intention to 
study and during my last 
two ytars at Yalt, talu 
ali 
th~ mtd school 
rtquir~mmts and go to 
UCSF mtd school. 
Fuck you, someone answers. 
Elsewhere another optimist ventures, 
10 ytars from now your gradts won't matttr. 
Be happy. 
Dr~am on, replies a morose colleague. 
Thry affict your prtunt and thtrtfor~ your 
Jutuu. 
Would future generations appreciate 
the witty aHusiveness of our griping? 
•Tht library is eksolation. It has a sm~/1

Or would they focus on the grim tone 
of so much of the graffiti, and confuse the 
darkly funny with the merely dark? 
Do you tvtr ful likt jumping out of this 
window? asks someone on the sixth floor. 
God yts, another answers, but that's a 
b~tur ont high~r up. 


Whining about stress goes hand 
in hand with whimpering about 
loneliness. One person captures the 
conflict between ambition and love 
poignantly: Fuck succm. All I want is 
to b~ wvttd. But b~ing htrt, it is hard 
rom to wvt myu/f 


The signs of deprivation are 
everywhere. 
In answer to the pitiful 
confession My boyfrimd just dumptd 
m~. ~ wmt out for a ytar and I still 
lovt him a lot but h~ dotsn't want 
anything to do with mt comes the pathetic 
reply, I wish I had somtont to dump mt. 
I /ov~ C.S. Too bad I'm an ugly 
fmhpmon. I How ugly?

Some of the graffiti 
are less brooding, more 
dir..ect; 
few 
are 
refreshingly porno-
graphic. 
Oh lord, my dick is 
small. Htlp mt. I Gtt 
ovu it. 
I'm thirsty. Ali I 
nud is a juicy snatch 
ovtr my faa to qumch 
my thirst. (Am I asking 
too much?) 


The irony of 
writing 
anonym-
ous confessions of 
loneliness is not lost 
on 
everyone, 
and 
some suggest helpful 
alternatives: 
I don't gtt mough action. I Gtt out of 
tht fucking library. thm.

The walls of the stacks teem with self-
conscious philosophizing and smart-aleck 
rebuttals. T h ey suggest a population 
madly analytical and neurotically obsessed 
with being right. A battle rages berween 
the pseudo-intellectuals and the anti-
intellectuals, though the djstinctions often 
blur. O ne conversation in a carrel on floor 
3M reads like the transcript of a 
philosophy section in hell:

Rando m pontifications and aimless 
ramblings cover every flat surface in the 
stacks:

Affiicted with a combination of '90s 
navel-gazing and Ivy League ology-itis, 
Yalies debate the implications of Yaleness 
ad nauseam.

The next loop of the inward spiral of 
self-analysis brings us to metagraffiti, or 
graffiti about graffiti: 
Graffiti is almost likr drink, n'm-u pas? 
Tht truth comts out, ptoplr sprak thrir 
mind, and it ain't prttty. 
Stacks graffiti is so comforting. Not 
quiu as political as bathroom graffiti, for 
surt. I Graffiti is a good thing, but Yair 
sums to bt full of thru uxually frustraud 
ptrvtrts who can't think of anything 
particularly illuminating to shart. 
Nrvtr havt I sun such a pathrtic display

wraklings! I And you'vt just jointd thrir 
ranks. 


Political graffiti? Forget about it. The 
spirit of Keith Haring does not live here. 
These are the dosed-circuit mutterings of 
intellectuals-in-training who know their 
voices can be heard in the mainstream, 
not the exuberant sloganeering of '60s 
campus radicals or the expressive "tags" 
and "pieces" of street writers "gening up," 
as graffi t i-wri ting is known in the 
business. Here and there you may see a
