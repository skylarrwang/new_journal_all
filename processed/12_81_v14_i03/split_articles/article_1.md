The mood in America is changing. Declining productivity has focussed new 
attention on the need to increase national savings as a means of replacing 
and modernizing outdated plant and equipment. Recognizing this, and also 
wishing to help their employees achieve personal savings goals, many large 
employers have established savings, profit sharing and stock ownership plans 
for their employees. 


Kwasha Lipton is perhaps the nation's 
leading consultant for these plans. We 
help design them, establish administrative 
structures, and maintain employee ac-
count records. These plans are decep-
tively complex, and working with them is 
both challenging and re-
warding. Individuals with 
math, accounting, or com-
puter aptitude and the abil-
ity to work well with other 
people should contact

**Title: About this Issue**
**Page number(s): 3**

This issue of The Ntw journal should 
feel a bit thicker to you than previous 
editions. Since you last read us in 
October, we've added eight pages to 
our format. This new size gives us the 
kind of flexibility that a growing, 
aggressive publication needs; the extra 
space will allow us to publish more 
articles, use additional photos and run 
more ads while keeping our design 
intact. 


The added pages are possible 
because of people like Geoff Fried and 
Jane Hinson. As Designer and 
Production Manager respectively, they 
make a magazine from piles of copy, 
ad orders, and contact sheets. Fried, a 
second year design student, has spent 
this semester creating the fundamental 
design for TN] and will serve as 
design consultant in the future. 


Hinson, ajunior in Berkeley, is in 
charge of coordinating all aspects of 
the magazine and setting the deadlines 
that make TN] go. 


We'd like to call your attention to 
this issue's Special Report written by 
Walter Jacob and Nathan Copple. 
Jacob provides an analysis of the 
Tobin Committee report, a story 
which he first began working on last 
spring. Copple reports on a proposal 
made by junior faculty in the English 
department to reduce the number of 
courses they teach-a story which 
relates to the perennial tensions 
between teaching and scholarship. 


Also in this issue, Ed Bennett and 
Andy Court interview Kathleen 
Cleaver, '83, the wife of former Black 
Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver. And 
Jim Lowe investigates student 
involvement in WYBC. Lowe, a 
freshman in M orse, was elected to the 
Staff on October 27. For the past two 
issues, be has worked on advertising 
and production, while also editing the 
copy to keep our style consistent. We 
welcome him to the Staff.
