"It's a recommendation that 
everybody realizes cannot be 
enforced." 
Dean for Academic Planning, said the 
replies to blind letters play a vital role in 
tenure decisions at Harvard. 
"Our letters go back to the depart-
ment, but they also go .along to the 
President," she said. "It's generally 
viewed as a very critical, acute and 
highly valuable, important method cf 
evaluation." 
Keller said the blind letters evoke 
much more insightful advice from ex-
perts than simple requests for personal 
recommendations could. 
"There's a very big difference be-
tween a blind letter and a letter of 
recommendation," she said. "If people 
are asked to write a letter of recommen-
dation, they really don't respond unless 
they have something positive to say." 
The blind letter, Keller added, "puts the 
appointment in competitive context." 
Keller maintained that neither the 
use of outside recommendations nor the 
abolition of associate professorships 
with tenure in the late 1960s have 
caused a decline in risk-taking. She 
estimated that one-third of Harvard's 
tenured spots go to people who are pro-
moted through the school's junior 
ranks, a figure that ranks low next to 
Yale's 50 per cent. 
"People have complained about a lack 
of risk-taking, but the evidence doesn't 
really back it up," she said. "It clearly is 
the case that younger people do get ap-
pointed." 

That doesn't mean that many junior 
faculty at Harvard make it to tenure, 
however. 
"We're looking for the best qualified 
candidate," said 
Bertrand . Dreben, 
Special Assistant to the Dean of the 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Har-
vard. "'nly a very small proportion of 
junior faculty ever get promoted." 
Tobin noted that Harvard's tenure 
policy relies much more heavily on out-
side advice and presidential opinion 
than would Yale even under the 
Report's recommendations. At Har-
vard, he said, the president makes every 
tenure decision by himself based on 
recommendations from an ad hoc com-
mittee. 
"T~at's quite a 
difTereJ~t constitu-
tional system," Tobin said. 
SelfÂ·lnterest 
Tobin foresees slow progress for his 
committee's report in the upcoming 
faculty and administration debates. The 
report must still be reviewed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Faculty of 
Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Yale 
College and that of the Graduate 
School, the Joint Boards of Permanent 
Officers, and, finally, if warranted, the 
Yale Corporation. 
He reacts to arguments about risk-
taking with exasperation. 
"The report 
says 
we're always 
forward-looking," he said. "We're using 
achievement only as an index of what 
the future may tum up. (A junior facul-
ty member] is not competing outside his 
weight class, provided there's good 
reason to believe that when he's 55 he'll 
have a similar record to show." 
Tobin 
suggested 
that 
the 
Committee's recommendations on risk-
taking don't need to be enforced. 
Departments would only be hurting 
themselves, he implied, if they didn't 
follow the Committee's guidelines. 
"What forces them to do it is their 
self-interest in having a good depart-
ment, one would hope!" he said,"' don't 
know how else you'd do it!"
