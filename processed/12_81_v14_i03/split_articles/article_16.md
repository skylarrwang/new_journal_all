**Research----The tiniest wires**

In the last ten years, no area of 
technology has changed how Americans 
live and work more than microelectron-
ics, which each year has produced 
smaller, cheaper, more sophisticated 
devices, ranging from wrist-watches to 
computers. But industry is gradually 
approaching the limit of how much cir-
cuitry it can cram onto a tiny silicon 
chip using today's most advanced 
technique. As researchers discover new 
ways to make smaller structures, they 
find that the materials they work with 
behave differently. 

At Yale, Professor of Engineering 
and Applied Science Daniel Prober is 
working with some of the smallest elec-
tronic structures ever made. His 
research has shown that the resistance 
of very thin wires increases as the 
temperature is lowered, the direct op-
posite of what happens with thicker 
wires. In fact, a thin wire can change. 
from being a conductor at room tem-
perature to being an insulator at 
temperatures close to absolute zero. 

In order to study this unusual proper-
ty, 
Prober pioneered several new 
techniques in microfabrication. He and 
associates M.D. Feuer and N. Gior-

dano made a major breakthrough two 
years ago when they found a way to 
construct a true thin wire, ten-thousand 
times smaller than a strand of hair, 
becoming the world's smallest wire. 

Though it can only make simple struc-
tures, Prober's technique can define 
features 20 times smaller than the most 
common industrial technique. These 
structures are so small that he examines 
his work using an electron m icroscope, 
and even then it appears a little fuzzy. 

To make a thin, metal wire, Prober 
first creates a microscopic step on a 
glass slide. He covers the step with a 
metal film and then shoots Argon ions 
at the slide from an angle. The ions eat 
away all the exposed metal, but they 
cannot reach a thin sliver protected by 
the step. The idea is a simple one. 
When someone shines a flash!ight down 
a flight of stairs, a certain area of each 
step remains 
shaded. 
Similarly, 
P rober's step shades an area from the 
ions, and that is where the wire is 
formed. 

Prober became interested in studying 
thin wires when he heard Dr. D.]. 
Thouless, 
a 
renowned 
theoretical 
physicist, speak at Yale. T houless ex-
plained his theory that thin wires would 
stop conducting electricity as 
the 
temperature approaches absolute zero. 
But before Probq could conduct any 
experiments, he had to fmd a way to 
make them. 

Strangely enough, Prober's inspira-
tion for making thin wires struck him 
while standing in the fourth floor men's 
room of Becton Center. 
"I remember I was thinking of smear-
ing a wire against a step, just like you 
apply puddy to a window edge," said 
Prober. "Then it occurred to me-coat 
the whole window with puddy and then 
remove everything, except [the puddy] 
along the edge of the window . . . As 
soon as I thought of it, I knew it was 
right." 

Once they had the small wires, they 
proceeded to test Thouless' theory and 
found it, despite some quantitative dif-
ferences, to be correct. The Yale ex-
perimentalists were the first to prove 
this, scooping Lincoln Labs, Bell Lab -
and IBM, all of which have greater 
facilities and resources.
