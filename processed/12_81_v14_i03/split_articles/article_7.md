**A Plan to Test Teachers**

One of the Tobin Committee's recom-
mendations was that Yale should ex-
amine 
more 
closely 
the teaching 
abilities of its candidates for promotion 
(see TNJ Oct. 24). The committee pro-
posed a teacher evaluation form system 
in many ways similar to that which ex-
ists at Princeton. Students would be re-
quired to 
fill 
out standardized 
anonymous forms at the end of each 
semester. The results would go to the 
professor and his department chairmen 
fc_>r consideration in promotion deci-
stons. 

Unlike Princeton's forms, however, 
Yale's forms would not be made public 
record and could not be reviewed by 
students. Tobin said his committee did 
not consider making evaluation form 
results available to students. "If all ques-
tionnaires are just going to be public 
property, they may be filled out with 
something else in mind," he said. 
P rofessor Robert Apfel, who studied 
teacher evaluation systems as chairman 
of the Teaching and Learning Commit-
tee in 1980, saw the omission of the 
public record provision as a political 
concession. Apfel has stated his belief 
that the faculty would react unfavorably 
to any teacher evaluation form system. 
"I think probably the Tobin Commit-
tee was taking a pragmatic position 
there," he said. •If the faculty is feeling 
persecuted by evaluation forms, they'll 
feel even more persecuted if they are 
made a matter of public record." 
Associate Professor Robert \Vest-
brook agreed. •My sense is that if the 
proposal passes muster, it will be in part 
because of the restricted access people 
have to the questionnaire," he said. 
Apfel worried that the Tobin Com-
mittee had not fully considered a format 
for the teacher evaluation forms it was 
proposing. The functions of a Course 
Improvement Form, which Yale now 
uses, are very different from those of a 
Rollin Riggs-The New Joumat 
Robert Apfel, former chairman of lht Teo.ching and Learning Committee 
teacher evaluation form and should be 
kept separate, he said. Course Improve-
ment forms are for recommendations 
for improvement alone, he stressed, 
while evaluation forms are for rating a 
professor's performance. 
"Any anempt to do two things at once 
would be a mistake," Apfel said. •If I 
think it's too confusing to the student 
about what role the forms are playing, I 
will oppose it.., 
To resolve the problem, Apfel sug-
gested putting the two forms on 
separate sheets of paper. 
As 
at 
Princeton, the Course Improvement 
sheet could be sent to the professor for 
his personal use, while the evaluation 
sheet could be processed separately. 
Apfel also urged that the Teaching 
and Learning Committee not be given 
responsibility for distributing and pro-
cessing the forms, as it does now for 
Course Improvement Forms. Apfel said 
the forms could not be administered 
and evaluated consistently by a body 
whose membership changes every year. 
"The Teaching and Learning Com-
minee should not become an im-
plementation organization," he said. 
"There is really very little long-term 
memory. It has to be adopted by the ad-
ministration.,. 
The battle over evaluation forms is 
just beginning, Apfel said. •1 think 
there's going to be a lot of negative talk 
about evaluation forms, I think student 
input is going to be very important.
