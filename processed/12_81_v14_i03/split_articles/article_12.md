Cleaver: Yes, but at the age of 20, 
there's nothing that can move fast 
enough if you think that your people 
have been oppressed and enslaved and 
held down for 400 years by these vicious 
United States. 

NJ: So your attitude changed before 
you met Eldridge? 

Cleaver: Yes. It seemed to me that the 
way to rearrange things was through 
war. When people reach the point that 
they won't respect you, they won't give 
you what you want and they won't be 
reasonable, then just shoot them. Then, 
you can talk to them. 

NJ: Shoot first and ask questions later? 

Cleaver: No. If you make it clear that 
you're not going to be pushed around 
any more, that anyone who tries will be 
shot, it changes the dialogue a lot. 

NJ: Then what happened? 

Cleaver: The entire weight of the 
government was thrown against it (the 
movement] and eventually that weight 
suppressed it and broke it apart. It 
wasn't that organized to begin with. It 
didn't destroy the beliefs in the people, 
but it did destroy the manner in which 
they could carry them out in an 
organized fashion. Once that happens, 
in my case anyway, you ask questions. 
What if the whole government dropped 
dead and said O.K., it's all yours, you 
change it? Could this group of revolutionaries have done it? Frankly I don't 
think so. 

NJ: Why? 

Cleaver: Because they were so busy 
trying to destroy something. There 
were two reasons why they failed. One, 
they didn't understand what they were 
trying to destroy. They only had a partial 
appreciation of it. The other thing, 
the destruction of it won't be the total 
solution to the problem. The problem 
they were protesting in a large part was 
a spiritual problem which will exist 
regardless of your economic, political, 
or social structure. They will always 
manifest themselves in different ways. 
People kill and hate and try to ruin each 
other's happiness in any society. This is 
not limited to the United States of 
America. 


those societies. You have a different 
perspective. 

NJ: Did the transformation of you and 
your husband's ideas happen fairly 
parallel when you lived abroad? 

Cleaver: Probably, but not consciously. 
He seemed to be more radically 
changed. He was more vocal about it. 
My change was less articulate and more 
personal. I got tired of people ripping 
me off and telling me lies. I had to re-
examine who were these people who 
claimed to be revolutionary. 

NJ: Were you religiously moved? 

Cleaver: Yes, yes. 

NJ: Do you think being forced to live 
outside the society for so many years 
changed your view of America? 

Cleaver: Yes. It made it look a lot better. 
You get to make some realistic comparisons. 
That's what happened to Eldridge in a lot 
of ways. He got to see the Soviet Union 
and the communist world and the Third 
World and Europe. He saw that America 
was a lot better off in many respects than 
any of


NJ: But did what was happening to 
your political ideas somehow tie into 
what was happening to your religious 
ideas? 

Cleaver: It could be. My religious ideas 
had been abandoned about the time of 
my graduation from high school. I was 
18. By the time my revolutionary ideas 
started collapsing, they were revived. In 
a way I was startled to discover that 
things I thought I no longer believed I 
still did believe. The character of some 
people who claimed to be revolutionary 
was very disturbing to me. They were 
doing things and saying things I really 
couldn't go along with. I had to realize 
that the reason I couldn't go along with 
it was because there was a conflict in 
values. 

NJ: What specific religious values? 

Cleaver: That you should be generous 
and kind, you shouldn't shoot and steal, 
that you shouldn't lie. All revolutionaries 
lie. 

NJ: Propaganda? 

Cleaver: Yes, they talk only about the 
negative qualities of the thing they're 
opposing, and they're not going to be 
able to present a balanced view. The 
truth is lost. That began to disturb me. 

NJ: You were communications 
secretary, so you were aware of this. It 
was your job. 

Cleaver: Yes. 

NJ: So you were lying? 

Cleaver: No, it wasn't so much that I 
was lying, but it became clear to me 
that revolutionaries require lying. It 
wasn't so much the Black Panthers. I 
didn't think so much that we were lying, 
but we were only talking about the bad 
stuff. The enemy. We were making the 
United States government our enemy 
by only talking about the most terrible 
aspects of it. We never gave any credit 
to anything good. The black and white: 
that's a distortion. After I'd been in 
Paris I was reading a lot of radical 
newspapers and newsletters from all of 
them, and the communist stuff would 
always say they won. Their newsletters 
were not valid. 

NJ: What did they charge when you 
came back and your husband went to 
prison? 

Cleaver: They charged that he was an 
agent, that he had made a deal. 

NJ: Did they charge this against you 
personally also? 

Cleaver: I must have been in there 
somewhere. I think some Communist 
made a statement that my father 
worked for the CIA. 

NJ: How did you feel about that? Did 
you feel betrayed? 

Cleaver: I thought it was rather absurd. 
I didn't feel betrayed. I felt that 
people were just saying stuff that they 
didn't know anything about. People 
love to do that. That's their favorite activity. 

NJ: When you look back at the 1960s, 
do you see yourself in that mold? 

Cleaver: As a person who doesn't 
know? Sure, but I was only twenty-one. 
I knew a lot for 21, but maybe just not 
enough. 

NJ: Do you think it was a combination 
of being young and the times? 


NJ: You would say you were naive? 

Cleaver: No more than anyone else. I 
was a lot less naive than some people, 
but I was naive. We were all naive. 
That's why we were revolutionaries. 

NJ: But the decision that you made 
then really affected your life in a very 
serious way. 

Cleaver: They did. They also affected 
my outlook on life. They still affect my 
outlook on life, but I'm older, and I see 
there are explanations and historical 
processes that operate in any society to 
the disadvantage of somebody. 

NJ: You have no contacts with the 
radicals anymore? 

Cleaver: What do you mean by that? 
Why do you ask me that question? 

NJ: I meant more in terms of the people 
who used to be Black Panthers who 
you still see. 

Cleaver: I know some, but the people 
I'm in touch with are no longer Black 
Panthers. 

NJ: What are they doing? 

Cleaver: Everything. They're raising 
families, going to school, working for 
the government. 

NJ: Are they activists anymore? 

Cleaver: No, they're all too busy. 

NJ: Are you active anymore politically? 

Cleaver: No. 

NJ: Why not? 

Cleaver: Well, I'm busy. 

NJ: Busy with what? 

Cleaver: Raising my kids, going to 



school. I've been working. If you decide 
to live within a society as a responsible 
citizen, then you get all the burdens. If 
you want to destroy your society, you 
don't get caught up in it, and you don't 
want to be a part of it. You just want to 
stir up the people inside to be against it 
and challenge everybody. If you don't 
do that, then you become a part of 
society. That's why I've been so busy. 

NJ: You've only been here a little 
while. 

Cleaver: About 12 weeks. 

NJ: You dropped out of college twice. 
Why? Because it seemed irrelevant? 

Cleaver: Yes, it was boring, dull, cold. 
It didn't seem to relate to what the world 
was about. 

NJ: Do you find that it's relevant now? 


NJ: Do you think it's a change in place, 
in institution, or is it the way you're approaching it? 

Cleaver: I think I have a better ability 
to select things to study that are relevant 
now. 

In the last 20 years, a lot of things 
have changed, but they haven't changed 
right away. A lot of attitudes have 
changed; practices have changed. 
They've changed a lot more quickly 
than they would have in any other 
society. That's the thing that's really intriguing to me: how is it possible that 
America can change so quickly in so 
many things? And, at the same time, 
not change really. The rock bottom 
stays the same. It's absolutely 
fascinating to me. I'd like to study that. 
The fact that I'm intrigued by that and 
I've observed that makes the things that 
I study more interesting to me. I'm 
looking for certain pieces of information. 

NJ: You can make the connection between history and people's lives. 


NJ: I think today we sometimes have 
trouble making that connection, 
because history hasn't imposed itself on 
our lives. 

Cleaver: Well, it has, but you don't 
know it. There are a lot of things you 
take for granted. 

NJ: It hasn't clobbered us yet. 

Cleaver: No, but it looks like it just 
might. Don't worry, I think that you 
might get a chance for history to clobber 
you, too. 

NJ: I was just wondering whether since 
you've been in classes with a number of 
Yale students, and I'm sure you've had 
a chance to talk with them, do you 
perceive the differences? 

Cleaver: I can't judge, because when I 
was 18 or 19 and in college, I was with 
other people like me. Now, I'm different. 
Students seem kind of nebulous. They 
don't know one way or the other what 
they're going to be. What they are one 
week they might be different the next. 
They're not really fixed on anything. I 
think I was, in a way, a lot more fixed on 
certain things. 

NJ: I'm very interested in what you 
said earlier about students today being 
more sophisticated. Do you perceive us 
as being more selfish? 

Cleaver: Yes, you're not spiritual and 
idealistic. Some are, but we all were. 
We did believe in democracy and 
things. Do you think about that stuff? I 
guess it was romantic. Maybe that was 
the difference. Your generation isn't 
very romantic. They listen to that terrible, 
disgusting music, like what my son 
listens to. 

NJ: What did you listen to? 

Cleaver: What my parents thought 
was terrible and disgusting: rock and 
roll. I don't listen to it anymore, that's 
the difference. I also listen to jazz. Now 
I like to listen to the symphony. Maybe 
it has to do with age. 

NJ: For someone who was an activist-and I feel you're not a revolutionary 
anymore, but you still consider 
yourself an activist, someone who'd be 
willing to become involved again-
doesn't it disturb you to see people who 
are much more oriented along career 
and personal lines, but not political 
lines? 

Cleaver: Everybody talks about it. 

NJ: It's a cliche. 

Cleaver: Yes. You ask me if that's 
disturbing. I'm not sure, because I 
think I need to know what kinds of 
attitudes and people are they who are 
going to become the future. What kinds 
of attitudes are they going to exhibit as 
lawyer, businessman, surgeon, politician? 
If they are really humane and really 
people who are concerned about their 
schools, their neighbors, the environment, 
then they'll take positive steps. If the 
issue arises that they're not, and they 
don't care; they're out to make money; 
they're out for themselves; that's very 
destructive and alienating. If they want 
to participate in a destructive and 
alienating way, they have an enormous 
opportunity to do that. That's disturbing 
to me. My generation didn't want to 
participate as professionals within that 
kind of society. We'd rather change it. 
We'd rather spend our time figuring out 
how to get rid of that stuff than helping 
it grow. There's a revolutionary 
undercurrent in America. It pops up and 
it goes away, and then it pops up again. 

NJ: It's like a phoenix. 

Cleaver: Yes, it is. Every time it pops 
up it gets completely destroyed. 

NJ: There will probably be another 
spurt. 

Cleaver: Probably. 

NJ: And it will mess up a lot of peoples' 
lives. Did it mess up your life? 

Cleaver: Well, it made a big dent in it, 
but I don't think it messed it up. 

NJ: I'm very interested about-

Cleaver: Why I'm in college at the 
same time as you? I don't mind the fact 
that I'm in school and I have to go back 
and start over. That's not the worst 
thing in the world. There are a lot of 
people who didn't even survive. Their 
lives really are messed up. They're in a 
penitentiary and they're going to be 
there for the rest of their lives. They're 
in the underground. 

NJ: Could that have happened to you? 

Cleaver: Yes, it could have happened, 
easily. 

NJ: Do you think about that a lot? 

Cleaver: No, it's not the kind of thing 
you want to dwell on. I think about it; 
I'm very conscious of it. I'm very happy 
that it didn't happen to me. 

NJ: Now you're working on your 
autobiography? 

Cleaver: Yes, I think this deserves 
one. It would take a while to explain all 
of this.
