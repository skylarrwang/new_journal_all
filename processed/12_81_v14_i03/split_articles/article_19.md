The Gate of Heavenly Peace by Jonathan Spence
1981 Viking Press 465 pp.

Cheers, the thousands of mountains and rivers, all liberated now,
Unfurl the glowing red flag with five gold stars
Chairman Mao waves his hand at the Gate of Heavenly Peace;
In an instant, history has rolled away so many centuries.
- Lu Ping, 1962

At the South entrance of the old Imperial palace in Peking stands the Gateway of Heavenly Peace, which Chinese history professor Jonathan Spence has chosen as an emblem of the changes in China during 85 years of revolution and the title for his latest book. In The Gate of Heavenly Peace, the political and social upheaval from 1895 to 1980 forms a backdrop for an exquisite portrayal of the lives of several of China's most distinguished writers, philosophers and intellectuals. 

Spence makes his account personal and interesting by focusing on three individuals who tried to make sense of their lives in this turbulent period. Kang Youwei was a Confucian scholar and political activist who struggled to revitalize the dying Ch'ing monarchy. Lu Xun was a brilliant novelist and journalist during the period of warlordism and the subsequent struggle against Japan. Ding Ling, a feminist, became a major spokesman and critic of Mao's regime. 

These intellectuals appear as adventurous, romantic figures who were willing to make difficult life decisions as they saw the results of China's social turmoil. Ding Ling suffered through the arrest and murder of her lover, Hu Yepin, by the Guomintang. Even in these circumstances, Ding managed to continue writing. Ultimately, she decided to stake her fortunes with the Communist party. Her decision was perilous, for at the time of her arrival the Communists were in acute danger of being exterminated. Kang Youwei had stridently urged that China avoid bloodshed by enacting peaceful, gradual political changes. But he came to despise a dictator, Yuan Shikai, so profoundly that he joined in assassination intrigues against the ruler. Lu Xun, while studying medicine in Japan, realized that China's weakness lay in its impoverished spirit; he returned to China to pursue writing. 

Burdened with a broader historical vision than that possessed by the ruling elite, the intellectuals were often frustrated in the activist political roles. Kang Youwei repeatedly petitioned the surrogate Empress Dowager Cixi to instigate political reforms in order to ward-off disaster, but the conservative empress would not listen. Kang then made a futile attempt to restore the boy emperor Guangxu to the throne. The attempted insurrection was a disaster. 45 years later, Ding Ling found herself wavering in her loyalty to the Communists. She published an essay criticizing the regime. Women, she wrote, were not entirely emancipated in the new order: party cadres sneered at women who sought a career or refused to marry. In response, Mao quickly removed Ding from her editorial position and demanded that she and other intellectuals reflect on their attitudes concerning the Communist Party. 

Ding Ling gave in and recanted. 

Other characters emerge in Spence's account. Xu Zhimo's life, for instance, was both comic and very tragic. Xu came to the U.S. to study at Columbia, and then moved his residence to Cambridge, where he met notable aesthetes
