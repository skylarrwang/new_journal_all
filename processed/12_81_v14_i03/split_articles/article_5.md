**Title: Tobin, teaching and tenure Will Yale take risks?**
**Author: Walter Jacob**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

In the first evaluation of Yale's tenure 
policy since 1965, an ad hoc committee 
recommended in October that Yale 
"take risks" in appointing more young, 
promising professors. 
The committee, chaired by professor 
James Tobin, sent its report to every 
member of the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences. Yet two weeks later, the facul-
ty displayed no sign of enthusiasm. Few 
professors contacted had read the 
report; those who had gave it a 
lukewarm response. Robert Westbrook, 
an assistant professor in American 
Studies and History, said the report did 
not ensure a change in the university's 
treatment of junior faculty. 
"The report doesn't really make any 
startling departures from prevailing 
practice," he said. "None of the provi-
sions, none of the specific recommenda-
tions institutionalize risk-taking on 
behalf of younger faculty." . 
Other faculty members agreed with 
Westbrook, and argued that a number 
of recommendations in the report 
counteract the risk-taking recommen-
dation. 
"I agree with the opinion that Yale 
has to do more risk-taking with its 
younger people," Professor of Applied 
Mechanics Robert Apfel said. "How it 
will do it is another question." 

A risky business 
For junior faculty, a university policy of · 
risk-taking is much more than an 
abstract ideal. The Faculty Handbook, 
says, "Candidates for professorships are 
expected to stand in competition with 
the foremost scholars in their fields 
throughout the academic world." Con-
sequently, Yale associate professors 
seeking tenure often find themselves up 
against men and women from outside 
Yale with much more academic ex-
perience and many more published 
works. 
The decision to teach at Yale without 
tenure is its own kind of risk; the Tobin 
Committee's report reveals that of all 
those hired as assistant professors be-
tween 1960 and 1969, an average of 15 
per cent from the Humanities, Social 
Sciences and Natural Sciences were 
granted tenure. The prospects improve 
somewhat for those starting at higher 
ranks; of those entering Yale as 
untenured associate professors between 
1960 and 1969, 46 per cent eventually 
received tenure. 
But competition from outsiders re-
mains fierce. Frances Holloway, man-
ager for Yale's AffJimative Action Of-
fice, said that of the 60 new promotions 
and appointments to tenure at Yale in 
the last five years, 31 have come from 
outside the university. To make matters 
worse, Associate Provost Ellen Ryerson 
said the Provost's Academic Review 
Committee is currently looking at ways 
to reduce the size of the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences over time. 
The Tobin Committee's report shows 
concern for the junior faculty member 
faced with a shrinking job market. The 
report suggests that departments 
regularly review their professors' 
chances for tenure and discuss those 
chances with each candidate. Instruc-
tors and assistant professors should also 
be eligible for a term's paid leave after 
three years in the ranks, the report says, 
so that they may have time to do re-
search that may qualify them for pro-
motion. The report even goes so far as 
to ask that Yale provide professional 
training for junior faculty who cannot 
get tenure and want to change fields. 
"We must do a much better job than 
we've been doing in keeping junior 
faculty. well-informed about their per-
sonal prospects . . . so that they can 
make an informed decision on whether 
to stay here or not," Tobin said in a 
press conference on October 25. 
But tenure is what the junior faculty 
wants, and some faculty members 
doubt that the report's recommenda-
tions on risk-taking will give them a bet-
ter crack at it. 
Professor Horace Taft, who served 
on the Tobin Committee, said no 
guidelines suggested by the committee 
could possibly guarantee risk-taking. 
"There's no way to legislate it, it's a 
matter of style and a matter of attitude," 
he said. "It's a recommendation that 
everybody realizes cannot be enforced." 

Sacrifices for honesty 
Some of the proposals in the report have 
led faculty members to wonder whether 
the Committee is giving risk-taking a 
fair chance. For example, the Commit-
tee 
recommends 
the 
position of 
Associate Professor with Tenure be 
abolished. This may make the Univer-
sity more hesitant to appoint anyone to 
tenure, Taft admitted. 
Currently, 
associate professors with tenure receive 
less pay than full professors but have the 
same tenure security. The Committee 
argues that a tenured faculty member 
can never attain a full professorship. 
Taft said the greater justice achieved 
in abolishing the rank outweighs the 
sacrifices the University may have to 
make in terms of risk-taking. "' think it 
will make the tenure decision a sharper, 
perhaps tougher decision," he said. "It 
may result in perhaps fewer tenure pro-
posals. But it's more honest, in my opi-
nion." 
Keith Thomson, 
Dean of the 
Graduate School, said he favored the 
proposal but worried that professors 
would lose 
incentives 
for self-
improvement after getting tenure. 
Thomson said he hoped Yale would 
maintain incentives by starting newly 
tenured professors at the salaries that 
associate professors with tenure now 
hold, and later moving them up. 
"As far as I understand it, the notion 
would be to collapse the two pay scales," 
he said. "I would be opposed to starting 
everybody off at what is the current full 
professor's salary range." 
Tobin said he had not considered a 
large salary difference between newly 
tenured professors and those who had 
held tenure for a long time. 

Misdirected exP.rtlse? 
Some faculty have worried that risk-
taking would decline if Yale uses advice 
from "experts" outside Yale in appoint-
ments as the Committee suggests. The 
Tobin report urges departments to use 
recommendations from people of "re-
• cognized distinction" in their fields 
when making tenure or term associate 
professor appointments. The Commit-
tees on Senior Appointments would 
meet with three experts for each tenure 
case, the report said, and at least two of 
them would have to be outsiders. In no 
cases where outside experts are used 
would the expert have a vote in appoin-
ting or denying appointment to can-
didates, but they could clearly influence 
a department or committee's decision, 
Tobin said. 
If advice is supplied by people who 
have read a professor's published work 
but are not experts on his teaching 
abilities and other skills, some faculty 
argue, tenure decisions will be based 
more on prior achievement than on 
potential, and junior faculty will be 
placed at a disadvantage with respect to 
more experienced outsiders. 
Thomson predicted that the faculty 
would react negatively to the proposal 
because it represented a reduction in 
faculty power. 
"Yale has always relied on the Yale 
faculty making its own proposals and 
appointments," he said. "I think the 
Yale faculty would not readily give up 
the tremendous responsibility it cur-
rently has." 
Tobin admitted that he, too, ex-
pected debate on the issue. 
"I expect there are going to be some 
misgivings about this . .. because it 
does give power to outsiders," he said. 
Julie o·Nelll-The New Journal 
"But usually you don't lose anything by 
broadening the scope of advice." 
Risk-taking might also be jeopar-
dized by the way outside advice would 
be solicited under the Committee's 
guidelines. The Tobin Report calls for 
the use of "blind letters" that request not 
a specific recommendation of one can-
didate but rather a comparative rating 
of each individual on a list of candidates 
for a given tenured position (hence the 
term "blind"). Outsiders asked to rate a 
young scholar against one with more 
credentials might place more emphasis 
on prior achievement and sway a 
department's opinion towards older 
candidates. 

Flushing crimson 
Some indication of how risk-taking will 
be affected by proposals in the Tobin 
Report may be gleaned from Harvard's 
experience. Harvard abolished 
associate professorships with tenure in 
the late sixties and now uses both blind 
letters and outside consultants who sit 
on ad hoc appointments committees. 
Two Yale faculty members who wished 
to go unnamed suggested that some of 
the committee's recommendations were 
partial imitations of Harvard's tenure 
policy.
