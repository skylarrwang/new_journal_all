**Title: The strange case of WYBC**
**Author: Jim Lowe**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

For at least the past five years, WYBC, 
the Yale Broadcasting Company, has 
been in a peculiar position. Well-
respected and with high listener ratings 
in the New Haven area, the radio sta-
tion does not reach many Yale students. 
Although it is a registered undergradu-
ate organization and receives rent-free 
space in Hendrie Hall from the Univer-
sity, few Yale students are involved in 
the station. 

Currently less than half of the ap-
proximately 85 station members are 
Yale students, according to station 
Treasurer Ralph Lopez. At times in the 
past few years the percentages bave 
been as low as 10-20 per cent. 

Over the past few years the Universi-
ty administration has expressed concern 
over this situation. Said Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs David H enson, "I don't 
want to force WYBC to do anything, 
but I do want to make sure that their 
facilities are available to make contribu-
tions to the lives of students. Their 
charter states that that is what they are 
supposed to do." 

The officers of WYBC say they are 
trying to change the situation. Last year 
they reactivated WYBC-AM, a closed-
circuit station broadcasting exclusively 
to the Yale campus. They hope that the 
presence of Yale-oriented broadcasting 
will encourage students to get involved. 
"We really want Yale students to get 
involved," said Diana Riesman, the sta-
tion's General Manager. "There's a lot 
of promise here, we just need people to 
take advantage of the facilities. It seems 
that almost no one knows we're here." 

Reasons 
Why is there such a weak link between 
WYBC and Yale? One reason certainly 
is that the station's 1200 watt commer-
cial FM station is not geared toward a 
Yale audience. Bodt Riesman and 
Lopez readily admit that WYBC-FM is 
a New Haven and not a Yale station, 
and that it will almost definitely remain 
as such. It broadcasts a programing 
schedule of daytime jazz, Sunday 
classical and nightly Spectrum, a show 
Jeff Strong-The N- Journal 
of black programing consisting for the 
most part of disco and soul. In addition 
the station broadcasts a number of 
public access shows aimed at the New 
Haven community. 

WYBC is not the only college station 
that directs it.s programing at the sur-
rounding community rather than to the 
University. Dan Geller, the General 
Manager of Cornell's WVBR-FM 
admitted, "We play a game. Our logo 
says that we are the radio station of 
Tompkins County, but at the same time 
our charter requires us to 'train Cornell 
students in radio.' We try to balance 
these two callings." However, unlike 
WYBC, WVBR is "90 per cent stu-
dents." WFRD-FM and WDCR-AM 
at Dartmouth have similar student 
percentages, though they too aim their 
programing at the neighboring com-
munities. 

Yalies have not always been absent 
from WYBC. When it was founded 40 
years ago and up until 1959 the station 
was solely closed-circuit AM, broad-
casting only to the Yale campus and 
operated entirely by Yale students. By 
the mid-1950s the station had grown in-
to one of the most popular student ac-
tivities. However, as soon as it was in-
stalled in 1959, the FM station, which 
covers New Haven and surrounding 
communities, began to gain precedence 
at WYBC. The AM station became 
... 

basically a training ground for the FM. 
In 1968 major changes hit WYBC. 
The programing changed from a con· 
servative blend of classical and folk 
music to a schedule of progressive rock, 
black programing, jazz and communi-
ty-related talk programs. During the 
same period of time the Federal Com-
munications Commission began to 
press college stations to operate during 
vacations and summer periods and thus 
non-Yale people were encouraged to 
join in order to operate the station dur· 
ing those months. 

For a short time in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s WYBC dominated the 
radio ratings in New Haven. In the ear· 
ly 1970s, however, WPLR joined the 
New Haven radio market and took 
much of WYBC's format and hired 
away the best of the station's air staff. 
The station began to lose its ratings 
position, and it reexamined its pro-
graming. Black Spectrum began to 
grow in importance as did WYBC's 
New Haven-oriented public access pro-
grams. 

In 1972 the link to the Yale campus 
was lost. A studio frre knocked the 
closed-circuit WYBC-AM off the air. 
All Yale related programing generated 
by the Yale Broadcasting Company 
came to a halt. 

When on July 4, 1977 WYBC can-
celled almost all of its progressive rock 
programing and moved to the present 
schedule even more student interest was 
lost. By 1979 WYBC had only limited 
student involvement. The top three ex-
ecutive positions remained in the hands 
of Yale students mostly because the sta· 
tion by-laws required it. For the most 
part, Yale students were looked upon as 
foreigners at WYBC. As Joanne Lip-
man, a junior who spent her freshman 
year working at WYBC, said, "Yale 
didn't count at the station." The Yale 
community didn't figure in WYBC's 
focus. 

The opportunities 
"This place 
is a 
goldmine," 
said 
Riesman. "Where else could I be head 
of a legitimate company at my age? I 
mean, WYBC has respect everywhere 
but Yale." 

WYBC has the greatest respect in 
New Haven, particularly in the black 
community. But perhaps more impor· 
tantly from a Yale student's point of 
view, WYBC has a good reputation in 
the radio industry. Dick Cavett and joe 
Smith of Elektral Asylum Records are 
both WYBC alums. As mentioned 
earlier WPLR went to the trouble of 
hiring away a portion of the WYBC air 
staff. Indeed, Paula Schneider, the Sta· 
tion Manager at WPLR, said that most 
of the people she had met from WYBC 
were "very fine people. I have been very 
impressed with a number of them." She 
also points out that a college education, 
in addition to previous radio ex-
perie~ce, is becoming increasingly im-
portant in the industry, 

WYBC's facilities also have a lot to 
offer. Despite the fact that the station 
receives no operating funds from the 
University, it has managed to maintain 
an impressive record library and has 
obtained a good, if not state of the art, 
collection of equipment. Both Riesman 
and Lopez insist that the equipment 
situation will improve significantly in 
the future. "We don't have the revenue 
from ads like WDCR has but then 
they're number one in their market. We 
don't have that opportunity here. It's 
good stuff, but it could be better," said 
Lopez. 

Succeaa? 
The success ofWYBC's current effort to 
attract students will depend largely on 
the revitalized AM station. Riesman 
and others are counting on it to be the 
main Yale link. "The AM is already 
providing the rock music most Yalies 
Jeff Strong-The New Journal 
WYBC General MatUJ.ger Diana Riesmo.n 
hopes to attract more students to the station 
want to hear. Also, we are already 
broadcasting every football 
game. 
We're just starting," Riesman said. She 
talks of adding more live 
sports 
coverage and perhaps increasing the 
AM broadcast hours. Much depends on 
more manpower. 

All is not well at the AM, however. 
At present the station can be received at 
only a very few locations on campus. 
Much of the station's transmitting 
system needs to be replaced. This will 
take a great deal of money, something 
the station does not have at the mo-
ment. Lopez says that attempts are be-
ing made to raise funds for the AM and 
also for new FM equipment, but as of 
yet there have been no measurable 
results. 

There are other problems with the 
AM. Not only do people complain they 
cannot hear the station, they feel that 
even where it can be received its 3:00 
p.m. to midnight schedule is not suffi-
cient to serve the community. As Dean 
Henson said, "The AM is a good step, 
but it is only a step." 

What Dean Henson and others want 
to see in the end are more students 
working at WYBC. But student recruit-
ment by the station and student access 
to station membership are both prob· 
lems. WYBC did not include informa-
tion in the information packet sent to 
freshmen over the summer and did not 
submit information to the Yale College 
Council Student Handbook for publica-
tion in the 1981-82 edition. Even if a 
student were to fmd out about WYBC it 
would still be necessary for him to at-
tend the station's six week training pro-
gram and then pass a test in order to 
become a member. Not only is the time 
commitment 
excessive 
for 
many 
students, but some who have attended 
part of the program had criticisms for 
the way it was run. The station is not 
blind to those criticisms. Lopez admit-
ted that the training program might be 
a deterrent to some students. 

"Wt; understand there might be a 
problem there," Lopez said. "We're 
thinking about bringing back the heel-
ing system the station used to use. We 
haven't made a decision yet." 

Finally, there remains some question 
as to the depth of the station's commit-
ment 
to bring in Yale 
Riesman and Lopez both leave their 
positions at the end of this month, and 
thus this situtation is basically out of 
their hands. Only time will tell what the 
new officers will do. 

While WYBC 
has made steps 
toward integrating Yale and its students 
into its operation, there has yet to be a 
concerted effort to complete the task. 
Without improvements in the AM and 
without a concerted effort to recruit 
students little will be accomplished. It 
remains to be seen if the station will ac-
tually take these steps, and if the Yale 
Broadcasting Company can offer 
opportunities and an .atmosphere that 
will attract Yale students- the people 
the station's charter says it is supposed 
to train.
