EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Not long ago, I was killing time in the 
Gypsy Bar and talking with a woman 
from the School of Organization and 
Management. For some reason, she 
took it upon herself to guess which 
school I studied at. 

She immediately guessed med school, 
law school and graduate school, and 
was disappointed with the negative 
results. Not discouraged, she scrutin-
ized me more carefully. "You don't look 
like a forestry student," she said, and 
she was sure that she hadn't seen me 
around the SOM. After exhausting 
nearly all of the professional schools, 
she peered at me and said, "You don't 
go to the divinity school, do you?" I ad-
mitted to the fact and pointed to the 
several tables in the bar crowded with 
div students. She was somewhat in-
credulous. "Oh come on," she said, as if 
I were pulling her leg. 

It has not taken me long to learn that 
some in the Yale community are 
shocked when they find us out in 
public, behaving like "normal people," 
rather than at home in the cell reading 
the Bible and chanting. The divinity 
school is not some sort of brick, col-
onial, congregational monastary located 
two 
blocks beyond the science 
buildings. There is the assumption that 
every . one at the divinity school is ex-
tremely religious, spends every waking 
hour reading the Bible, preparing for the 
ministry in some organized church. 
This is simply not the case. 

To be sure, more than half of the div 
students are preparing for ministry in 
the 40 or so denominations they repre-
sent. But some will use their masters 
degree to go on to law school. Others 
will go into counselling; some plan to 
find a career in social services. Fre-
quently, I hear div students talking 
about their interest in working for the 
government or becoming a lobbyist in 
Washington. Some will pursue PhD's. 
One student worked as an architect 
before coming to div school, and he will 
return to that profession upon leaving. 
Many are planning to work in the
church, but not in the context of or-
dained minister or priest. The term 
coined for this is "lay ministry," but 
there is very little agreement as to what 
the term means. In the anxiety of the 
first week of div school, I kept on think-
ing to myself that I could get on a train 
and go to Columbia to study jour-
nalism- my original plan before 
deciding to come to Yale. 

Even though more than 20 chapel 
services are scheduled each week in 
Marquand chapel and the nearby 
Berkeley Center, it wouldn't be right to 
say that div students are overly religious 
and devout-just more so than the 
norm. No one has the courage or the 
stamina to try to attend all of the chapel 
services. Most attend a few. Some at-
tend none. I was worried when I ar-
rived in September that there would be 
no place at YDS for someone with 
questions, anxieties and general doubts 
toward religion. Overly religious people 
had always made me nervous since I 
suffered through a Christian fellowship 
meeting in college, never to return. At 
every turn, though I met someone who 
was scared to death to be here. Fre-
quently in conversation with entering 
students, we would discover that there 
was a mystery about how we ended up 
in New Haven on some sort of religious 
journey. Many have the need to answer 
some questions that date back to 
childhood. 

The variety of religious experience 
and people is vast: Some celebrate the 
glory of God; others the glory of 
humanity. 
And others celebrate 
something in-between. Some arrive 
Jews and leave Christians and a few ar-
rive Christians and leave Jews. Others 
are in search of unity in a spiritually 
discordant world. The most common 
attribute of divinity students, with the 
possible exception of uncertainty, is the 
desire to bring justice and relief to a 
world which has too much pain and too 
much suffering. 

Part of this is participating in the 
permeating social awareness at the div 
school and trying to turn this awareness 
into action. Nuclear arms protests and 
hunger fasts are one aspect of the 
awareness, but it goes much further.
