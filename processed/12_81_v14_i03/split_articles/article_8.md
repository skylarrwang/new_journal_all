**A Movement to Lighten Teaching Load**
**Author: Nathan Copple**
**Page number(s): 12**

Associate and assistant professors are 
often faced with a conflict between 
devoting their energies toward teaching 
which is what they are paid to do, or 
towards research, which is what is most 
likely to get them tenure. While The 
Tobin report attempts to address the 
concerns of the junior faculty, some 
junior faculty members in the English 
Department are seeking to reduce the 
number of courses they must teach. 
This would theoretically give them 
more time for scholarship, as well as im-
prove the quality of teaching. 
The plan ciills for reducing the junior 
faculty teaching load by two courses 
every three years. Ounior faculty cur-
rently teach five courses per year; senior 
professors teach only four.) The pro-
posal was approved on November 6 by 
the English Department's Under-
graduate Studies Committee (USC). If 
it passes the rest of the department, and 
then the senior faculty, it will be achiev-
ed by eliminating the Intensive Major 
Program, dropping seven of the upper-
level seminars, and adding two students 
to all of the sections of English 115, 125 
and 129. 
"I think this is as honorable a com-
promise as they could have reached," 
observed Assistant Professor Bryan 
Wolf. "Junior faculty in the English 
Department are vastly overworked. In 
addition to teaching one course more 
than most humanities professors, they 
must teach the courses (i.e., 
freshman writing courses) farthest from 
their own research." 
If the proposal passes, a significant 
amount of teaching t1me will be lost. 
With about 40 junior faculty members 
losing an average of two-thirds of a 
term per year, some 26-27 terms must 
be cut. Associate Provost Ellen Ryerson 
called the possibility of a junior faculty 
course load reduction "unreasonable, at 
best. We've made studies of this sort of 
thing before, and we don't believe it's 
academically feasible." 
This year's push for load reduction 
began 
in October when the 
department's Director of Under-
graduate Studies (DUS), Patricia 
Spacks, 
and the Associate DUS, 
Thomas Hyde, were asked to draft a list 
of places to trim the department's cur-
riculum should some cutbacks be 
necessary. Hyde noted that the pro-
jected budget for next year made some 
cuts inevitable, and there was a "fairly 
widespread dissatisfaction with the 
shape of the curriculum. For example, 
there are seminars with only three peo-
ple in them, and I think that this is 
because there's so~e unnecessary and 
unproductive duplication among our 
courses." 
The initial report detailed some 
changes even more drastic than those 
currently under consideration, such as 
teaching English 129 as a lecture 
course, eliminating 13 seminars (vs. the 
current seven), or tossing out English 
120 altogether. None of this was known 
to any undergraduates, with the excep-
tion of four seniors who, as members of 
the English Student Advisory Commit-
tee (ESAC), attended sessions of the 
USC. Jonothan Rak '82, the head of 
this years ESAC, had seen the proposal 
in advance and conducted a small, in-
formal survey of students whose choice 
of courses would be affected by it. Ma-
jors and non-majors alike agreed that 
many of the suggested cutbacks were 
drastic, 
some unacceptable. 
Rak 
assembled these opinions and presented 
them to the USC. He also argued that 
"many of these cutbacks are on paper 
only. Clearly, some one will have to 
teach all of these displaced students, 
regardless of how they are all shifted 
around." Between Rak's objections and 
others which ranged from "practical to 
political," the committee eventually re-
jected the motion as it stood. 
This action, however, only served to 
prolong what Hyde called "a sense of 
urgency among junior faculty members 
this fall. We probably won't have 
another opportunity to make a proposal 
like this for a long time." A different 
course reduction plan was proposed last 
year, only to be sent back by the senior 
faculty members for further planning 
and data. 
The English department places a lot 
of emphasis on its freshman courses. 
The most objectionable aspect of the 
current proposal is thus that it would in-
flate the size of freshman courses. But 
Hyde is quick to point out that grading 
the papers of the 22 students of one sec-
tion is a far easier thing to do than 
grading those for the 40 students of two 
sections. "If anything," he said, "I would 
hope that the quality of teaching in 
these larger sections would go up." 
The loss of seven seminars would not
