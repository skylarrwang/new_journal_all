Prober also applied his technique to 
creating a special electronic circuit 
called ajosephsonjunction, which may 
one day be a key component in a new 
breed of computers. In the nearer 
future, 
they 
will 
be 
the sensing 
elements of the most precise magno-
tometers, which measure magnetic 
fields, and microwave detectors, which 
fingerprint the molecular components 
of stars.

Many of the practical applications of 
techniques developed today may not 
materialize for 10 to 20 years. But even 
more importantly, before engineers can 
build extremely small electronic 
devices, researchers, like Daniel Pro-
ber, will have to discover the basic 
physical relationships at these small size 
scales. 

Because scientists are just beginning 
to investigate that end of the physical 
world, Prober is optimistic about the 
future. 
"There are a huge number of scien-
tific experiments that are yet to be 
created, let alone carried out. And as 
our capabilities for doing experiments 
extends down towards the molecular 
size scale, we can hope for a whole new 
realm of scientific exploration. Within 
20 years, we will be able to conduct ex-
periments at the same size scale as one 
does genetic engineering."
