street, into a performing arts complex. 

Financial negotiations with the city 
have been strained in the past, but talks 
have resumed recently. H e anticipates 
an important announcement regarding 
its status later this year. 

Schiavone has been criticized for not 
living up to his visions. 
"He came on the scene, two or three 
years 
ago, 
as Mr. 
Downtown 
Developer. H e built an image that I 
don't think is sustained by his perfor-
mance," said Andrew Houlding, 
managing editor of the New Haven Ad-
vocilU. 
"The image is that he'll spend a lot of 
money to do things right. The fact 
is-either he doesn't pay attention to the 
specifics of the work or he had no inten-
tion of doing it in the first place." 

The AdoocilU had run a story in 
March detailing thr- Schiavone Realty 
and Development Corporation's viola-
tion of fire codes at 1044 C hapel St. Fire 
escapes were in disrepair and workmen 
had nailed fire escape doors shut, accor-
ding to Houlding. A Legal Assistance 
lawyer said the Corporation moved to 
force tenants out of the building by rais-
ing rents before renovations were com-
pleted. The Schiavone Realty and 
Development Corporation has been in-
volved in 17 eviction cases since 1976. 

Critics also point out that it is taking 
Schiavone more than three years to 
renovate the Blackman building, dur-
ing which time it has been left an ugly, 
gutted hulk. 

Schiavone admits that development 
is a "slower process than rd imagined. 
rve only been involved in real estate for 
four years, and the past two to three 
have been an cilisolute disaster from a 
development point of view.• Interest 
rates have risen from eight to 21 per-
cent. 
"It's impossible to do developr;nent 
work without mortgage money. Neather 
Yale nor any finanical institution has 
made any attempt to provide mortgage 
money in downtown New Haven. 
Unless someone in the city takes the 
leadership, it's going to prolong the pro-
cess ad infinitum." 

Some see Schiavone's impulsiveness 
as his real problem. 
"In his three buildings on Crown and 
College St., he had the tenants out and 
the demolition started before the finan-
cial package was together," said a city 
government source. "This is not the 
conservative 'one step at a time' theory 
operating. It basically guarantees the 
building sitting vacant for a while." 

The tendency to change seemingly
attitudes 
is 
characteristic of -----------------
Schiavone. "It can be very positive in 
that it gives him a flexibility, but it also 
means you can't pin him down. You 
think a building is going to be commer-
cial on the first floor and residential 
above, then you discover it's all residen-
tial. There are code implications in this 
change." said a source in city govern-
ment. 

H enry Milone, owner of Gentree, 
Ltd. and The Brewery, offers another 
perspective on Schiavone's protean 
tendency. "He never answers your 
questions, 
but 
he'll 
navigate you 
towards 
solving your own. 
He 
somehow instills the interest and en-
thusiasm 
to 
answer the 
question t-----------------
yourself. You leave saying 'Yes, there is 
an answer and I can find it myself.'" 

Milone sees the showman side of 
Schiavone as an "escape from the 
methodical very calculated life he 
leads.'' For four hours a day he's flam-
boyant, Milone says; he spends the re-
maining time concentrating on the con-
cer_ns of eight major corporations. 

Schiavone's self-awareness impresses 
Milone. "Joel took me to Boston, to a 
class on family-held corporations at 
Harvard. It was a case study course and 
they were studying his. I sat in on the 
lecture he gave and was amazed at his 
awareness of who he is, his honesty 
regarding his limitations, and his can-
didness about his abilities. • 

Schiavone has indeed reflected on his 
activities, past and present. 
"There's an enormous amount of ego 
involved," he said. "When I was at Yale, 
I had a lot of inferiority and insecurity. 
Growing up meant getting out all those 
anxieties. You'll find most people who 
work hard- make a lot of money-
have a psychological drive that forces 
them onward and up. rm no different 
than anyone else."
