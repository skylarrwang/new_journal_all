EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Women's Studies encourages a large 
awareness of human connections be-
tween individuals and within society. 
Hopefully now that the major has been 
established, the program will reach 
more and more students in both sexes, 
and of all class and racial backgrounds 
at Yale .
