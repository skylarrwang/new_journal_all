Profile: Joel Schiavone 
developing downtown 
Linda Schupack 
The members of "B. B . Hind and the 
Blue Mooners" do not have to worry 
about finding a New Haven gig. Their 
guitarist, J oel Schiavone, owns New 
H aven R estaurant. 
And quite a bit more. 
Since he became active in New 
H aven development four years ago, 
Schiavone, Yale '58, has become a main 
mover in the downtown revitalization 
effort. H e owns over $5 million in New 
Haven real estate and his interests in-
clude the New Haven Restaurant, the 
New Haven Nighthawks, and the Con-
necticut Limosine Service. 
Although he owns eight corporations, 
Schiavone eschews the staid and stodgy 
three-piece suited business world, atten-
ding meetings clad in khakis and lzods. 
Several years ago, he sent a Christmas 
card which featured him in somber pin-
stripes standing next to his office desk. 
A n engraved insert explained that he 
had been asked for an official portrait. 
No lamb in wolfs clothing, Sch iavone 
had the inside of the card show the same 
scene-except his back was to the 
camera, stark naked. 
Not everyone appreciates Schiavone's 
style. 
"When you're dealing with the con-
servative banking community," said 
one city staffer, "it basically comes down 
to the fact that he doesn't wear socks. 
"He is erratic. H e's in two different 
bands and he's appeared on the Green 
in a tutu. Bankers have to ask, 'Do we 
want to be out on the line several 
million dollars in mortgage money on 
him?'" 
Schiavone recognizes that his per-
sonal style may be difficult for the 
business community to accept, but says 
people eventually come around. Com-

"It basically comes down to 
the fact that he doesn't wear 
socks." 

menting on the infamous pink tutu that 
he sported at the New Haven Bed 
Race, Schiavone smiled sheepishly and 
said, "I've had my moments. It's too bad 
I don't have a photo. I've got great legs." 
Schiavone was not always a colorful 
character in New Haven. A self-
described "non-entity" at Yale, he ex-
plained, "I didn't go to the right prep 
school and I did not do the right things. 
I always felt kind of awkward." 
In Silliman, Schiavone played intra-
mural soccer and tennis. When he ven-
tured out of the confines Of Yale it was 
not necessary to frequent downtown 
New Haven night spots. 
"I went to girls' colleges-Conn. Col-
lege and Smith. There was no reason. I 
just didn't have anything else to do." 
Schiavone doesn't blame Yale entire-
ly for his ambivalent feelings. "I was not 
a very mature person at the time. Fif-
teen years later, I became secretary of 
the class and am still. I met a large 
number of people I was sure I didn't like 
and now I found out I like them." 
After graduating from Harvard 
Business School in 1961, Schiavone 
took a temporary leave of absence from 
the family scrap metal business. Unable 
to get a banjo gig in Boston, he bought 
his own bar. In a matter of several 
years, over a dozen Your Father's 
Mustaches- a 
gay 
Nineties style 
pub- stretched across the United States 
and Europe. 
Schiavone phased out most of the 
clubs by the early seventies. "The old-
time nostalgia was selling less and less. 
Drugs and hard rock were not a part of 
our philosophy of life." 
The realization that night-club night 
life was not conducive to a wife and 
child brought Schiavone back to the 
family business that he now owns with 
his brother. The company diversified in 
1974, and soon Joel Schiavone scrap 
metal alchemist was also owner of the 
Shoreline Times, Connecticut Limosine 
Service, and the New Haven 
Nighthawks. 
Beginning in 
1978, 
Schiavone 
strategically bought up properties in 
what he considered "the emotional 
heart" of downtown New Haven. By 
showing his faith in the economic vitali-
ty of the city, Schiavone hoped to lure 
other investors downtown.

Schiavone renovated two run-down 
downtown buildings which now house 
Bryan Alden and the New Haven Rest-
aurant. The New Haven Restaurant 
with all its New Haven memorabilia ex-
emplifies Schiavone's role in the city. 
With its slogan, "A great town-A great 
restaurant," it sells not only french fried 
ice cream but an image of the city as 
well. 
Currently, Schiavone's main projects 
are the Elisha Blackman building on the 
corner of York and Chapel and the 
Warner building across from the Art 
and Architecture building, plans for 
commercial space on the bottom and 
either esidential or office space above. 
The Warner building will also have 
stores on the first floor and twenty-two 
luxury apartments above. Using photos 
of the buildings in 1895, Schiavone will 
attempt to have it look exactly as it did 
in that era. 
In the future, Schiavone plans to tum 
the College St./Crown St. area into an 
entertainment district. He has brought 
up buildings surrounding the Shubert 
Theater and proposed to convert the 
Roger Sherman Theater, across the
