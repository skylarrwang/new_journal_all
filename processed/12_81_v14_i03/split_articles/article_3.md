**Title: Dispelling doubts about women's studies**
**Author: Lisa Clark**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

On November 5, the Yale College 
faculty approved the Women's Studies 
major. The recognition that women are 
worth studying is an important advance 
in the status of women at Yale. It also 
quells some of the doubts that a 
discipline devoted to women offers a 
valid and rigorous education. 

Many students never take a Women's 
Studies course or take only one. Some 
complain that there are only white 
middle-class women in the classes; that 
the classes are too loosely structured 
while requiring too much work; or that 
outspoken and angry women dominate 
and intimidate other class members. 

In the first place, Women's Studies 
does not intend to attract only white, 
middle-class women. Understandably, 
women will be drawn in larger numbers 
than men because they identify more 
implicitly with the study of women. But 
men can benefit from an enriched 
awareness of the female perspective; 
women learn from studying about men 
in most other classes here. The program 
is not equally relevant to all races and 
classes however. This deficiency will 
hopefully be amended along with the 
community's increased acceptance of 
the major and with the addition of more 
course offerings. Women's Studies will 
continue to grow; it already claims 38 
courses cross-listed in 13 departments, 
though it was first implemented only 
four years ago. 

Secondly, those who criticize the 
classes 
for being disorganized 
misperceive 
the value of informal 
discussions in which professors present 
themselves less as masters and more as 
guides or participants in shared-
learning situations. 
Like seminars, 
these classes demand considerable 
reading, writing and thinking. The 
students who complain about the 
workload are missing out on the chance 
to study an inspiring subject-women. 

But of all grievances, the last one, 
that bitter feminists control the classes, 
needs the most attention and refutation. 
It reflects the misunderstanding of 
feminism at Yale by supporting a myth 
that Women's Studies responds to leftist 
feminist concerns alone, or that 
Women's Studies shelters radical lesbian 
feminists and prefers to exclude the rest 
of the Yale community. 

Women's Studies, like any other 
discipline, attracts students who speak 
up in class because they have an interest 
and background in the field. Unlike 
other disciplines, however, general 
topics often demand immediate per-
sonal application. Many discussions (on 
witch burnings, female poets, or Freu-
dian analysis, as examples) ask impor-
tant questions about 
female-male 
perceptions. Those students who ex-
plore and expose intimate views about 
the sexes can threaten other students. 
Sometimes the confusion or bitterness 
of women who realize that their sex has 
been oppressed, slips into discussions. 
Female-male relations are treated as 
private and sensitive topics in today's 
culture, and students are not trained to 
listen and respond well to personal 
reflections in an academic setting. Thus 
these comments are interpreted as an-
tagonistic outbursts in Women's Studies 
classes. 

If education is meant to teach 
students how to look critically at the 
world and its systems, then analysis of 
female-male differences is a crucial 
aspect of learning. If education aims to 
make students aware of their relation-
ship to the world and to other students, 
then again the habits of the sexes need 
to be analyzed. The Women's Studies 
department is based upon the study of 
female-male relations from the perspec-
tive of women, who have been less pro-
perly studied. Its ultimate goal is the 
opposite of separatism and antagonism:
