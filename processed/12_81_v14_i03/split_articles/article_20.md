EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
and fell in love with the wntmgs of 
Shelley. He returned to China, deter-
mined to discover an aesthetic spirit. In 
a period of brutality and hunger, Xu 
believed that China's hope lay in poetry 
and in the fearlessness and infinitude 
within the individual. 

Spence manages to combine these 
diverse elements of characters' lives into 
a cohesive portrait. His narrative moves 
freely from character to character; like a 
novel, its interest increases as more 
characters are introduced and they 
begin to interact. 

It seems a pattern is emerging in 
Spence's works. In The Death of Woman 
Wang, Spence explored the limitations 
and brutality of early Ch'ing life 
through the story of a woman who tried 
to run away from her husband. In both 
books, he presents history, not as a con-
tinuum of causes and effects, but rather 
as a collection of individual experiences. 
The reader of The Gate of Heavenly Peace 
feels a deep empathy with the events in 
• 
China because of this humanist ap-
proach.

Every part of a Sero shirt shows why we're known as the last of the 
great shirtmakers. Take for instance our Purist* button-down collar 
shown above. It's famous for its full bell-shaped roll. We take many 
extra steps, all done by hand, to create that collar. No one else makes a 
collar with such care and attention. But, then again, no one else makes 
a shirt like Sero does. 
The last of the great shirtmakers.
