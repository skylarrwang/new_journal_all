It has been two years since men's gymnastics lost varsity sport status, and a year and a half since he has last been employed, yet Don Tonry returns daily to Payne-Whitney Gymnasium to volunteer his time as coach of the men's gymnastics club. 

After founding the Yale gymnastics program, and spending 18 years as a coach and physical education instructor, Tonry was told in 1978 that budget cuts forced the Athletic Department to terminate his position and reduce his sport to club status. Tonry took his case to a University grievance committee, which found his dismissal "not just" and called for his retention as men's gymnastics coach. However, the University declined to act on the committee's ruling, saying the committee had exceeded its authority. In 1978 Tonry sued Yale for breach of contract and age discrimination, but in 1980 a Connecticut District Court upheld the University. 
At the same time Tonry was striken by multiple sclerosis, whose attacks, although never immobilizing, have at various times caused numbness, loss of speech, and partial blindness. 

After all this, why does Tonry volunteer to coach gymnastics at Yale? "Initially I did it to keep my sanity," he said. "I kept doing what I'd always been doing. I also felt an obligation, a guilt feeling I guess, towards the kids on the team I'd recruited." 

Tonry says he harbors no ill feelings towards Yale. "I would like to be very bitter. But I've spent my whole teaching career here; I have a strong attachment to Yale. You have to, right? Also, I don't really know any other gym. I've been coming here for the past 20 years." 

Don Tonry's commitment to the sport of gymnastics began at age 14 when he wandered into a Brooklyn YMCA and first saw a gymnastics class. Tonry went on to compete for the University of Illinois, winning the 1956 NCAA all-around competition. He has competed in three World Games and two Pan-American Games, and in 1960 he was a member of the United States Olympic Team. 

Tonry's experience is part of what makes him an excellent coach, club members say. "Don is probably one of the top two or three men's gymnastics coaches in the nation," said Dan Leahy, captain of the men's gymnastics club. "He essentially grew up with the sport. He personally knows the people who have invented the new moves in recent years. He's the kingpin, the pillar-there's certainly no better." 

Tonry and his wife Barbara, the coach of the women's varsity, have created a unique gymnastics team spirit. "Don and Barb have been the surrogate parents of the club," said Kevin Shrock, defending Ivy League all-around champion. "We've gone to the Tonrys' house for club dinners and to see old gymnastics films- that adds to the family atmosphere. It makes the club work together a lot better. It makes it fun to work out." 

This spirit keeps men's gymnastics alive at Yale, for the program has been hurt by the loss of varsity status. "We lost four things when we became a club sport," said Tonry. "We lost a coaching position, which is the most important factor. We lost money-now individuals must purchase their own uniforms; and if they can't afford to we look sloppy on the floor. We lose publicity-students aren't recognized as athletes. Because the level of competition among club sports varies, newspapers don't want club sports results. And we lose recruiting power automatically. Any athlete who wants to compete and study obviously goes to a school where they have both." 

"We haven't had any recruits for two years," said Dan Leahy. "I know of a couple of gymnasts who were accepted by Yale, but went elsewhere because we don't have a varsity program. This year four or five freshmen and sophomores have been coming out, but none have much experience." 

For the inexperienced men's gymnastics club, then, victory is no longer the primary goal. "We lost three seniors to graduation, and generally we lack depth," said Coach Tonry. "Of the twelve people in the club, five are beginners. I like to teach, but it's difficult. You look forward to winning, and suddenly the prospect is no longer there. It's difficult for the club and the coach, it takes the hope away. You do it for the sheer enjoyment of doing it." 

"Our goals have changed since we've lost our talented guys," said Dan Leahy. "We're going to have a good club, lots of fun, with excellent individual performances." He pointed out Shrock, George Ostrow on the pommel horse, Adam Chin on the rings, and Bill Quinn in vaulting as examples of individual achievers. "We're not win-oriented," he said. "Our goal now is individual highlights, having a good time, and doing our best." 

"Gymnastics is not like football or basketball, where you either win or you lose," continued Leahy. "There's room for individual improvement in meets. We're not in it to be heroes. The type of rewards we're after are types that can be satisfied if the club doesn't win." 

But some club members wonder if the relaxed, less competitive tone of Yale men's gymnastics is enough to keep the program going. "The future of men's gymnastics at Yale is very unclear," said Leahy, a senior. "There is interest in the program- we've got a bunch of new guys, and we've had three prospective inquiries. Right now the program is kept together due to Dan's contribution of his free time. If he can keep up, the program could grow." 

So the future of the Yale men's gymnastics program depends upon its founder, Don Tonry. "I'm working with lots of beginners again, and it's tough," he said. "As long as I'm up here, I suppose I'll do something. Without me, the people would train. But they would have no direction."
