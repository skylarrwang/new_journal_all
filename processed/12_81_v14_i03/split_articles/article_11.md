nard, Kathletm. worlcd for the Stw:knt Non-
violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 
1966. She mam"ed Eldridge in 1967 and

Panther Party. Four months after their mar-
riage, Eldridge was a"ested in connection 
with a shoot-out betwem Black Panther 
members and the Oakland Police. 

Eldridge Cleaver was evmtually released 
.from prison on a wn"t of habeas corpus, but

Eldridge su"mdered to U.S. authon"ties, and 
returned to prison. His statements reflected 
such a change .from previous positions that 
critics charged he had sold out. Two years ago,

The Cleavers with attorney Charles Garry outside of an Oakland Courthouse in September, 1968up-, 
NJ: W hen you and your husband 
decided to return to the States, you 
knew that meant that he was going to 
have to go to prison. 
Cleaver: Yes. It took about six weeks 
to make all the arrangements, and 
before he left, he knew what prison he 
was going to and the people in the 
Depanment of Justice that were respon-
sible. But, the three years before that, I 
had been going back and forth trying to 
get various attorneys in Washington or 
California or somewhere to do some-
thing so he could come back to the U.S. 
and be ou t on bail. After three years it 
became obvious that this was impossi-
ble. T hat was his desire; he preferred to 
come back and be free on bail, but he 
couldn't. So, he chose to come back and 
go to jail. 


**Title: Changing with the times**
**Page number(s): 17-18**

NJ: Why? Why that decision? 
Cleaver: Well, he didn't want to stay 
out of the U.S. any longer. Reagan 
wasn't governor in California any 
longer. They had a different governor; 
it was Jerry Brown. Nixon had been 
driven out of the White House in 
disgrace. John Mitchell, who was the 
chief architect of the whole repression 
that we were up against, had been con-
victed. I think he was in trial or else he 
had been convicted of obstruction of 
justice, which is about the mildest thing 
you can say about what he did. The 
CIA had been exposed. The commit-
• 
tees had come out and proved, and 
Senate investigations had documented, 
how the FBI and the CIA and other 
federal agencies had conducted surrep-
titious attacks in efforts to destroy the 
movement and organization and kill the 
leaders. All the hit lists that they had 
and tactics, all their documents were 
coming out. Even the FBI agents that 
accompanied Eldridge back on the 
airplane to New York said, "Who 
knows? We might be in jail together." 
They didn't know what was going to 
happen to them. All the stuff they were 
doing was illegal. 

NJ: They said this on the way back, on 
the plane? 
Cleaver: Yes. We knew; it wasn't any 
surprise to us. All these things were be-
ing done to us. If people are conspiring 
to kill you, you know it. If eight years 
later it comes out in the press, you 
know, the FBI conspired to kill you, 
you're not surprised. It's just that you 
feel vindicated, and that your point has 
been acknowledged. And, furthermore, 
they'd stopped. 

Also, the Vietnam War was over. A 
• lot of the polarization that our move-
ment was operating in, the very polar-
ized political and social situation where 
you had people vehemently and violent-
ly opposed to the Vietnam War, was 
gone. The whole system of confidence 
in the government had eroded, and by 
this time it was so low that the power 
relationship between the government 
and the citizen had changed a lot. 

NJ: You were no longer afraid that he 
might be killed in prison? 
Cleaver: No, well, not in the prison he 
was sent to. He was sent to a high 
security federal installation in San 
Diego. That wasn't the prison that he 
was supposed to go to when he left the 
country. He was supposed to go to San 
Quentin. 

NJ: When he came back to prison, 
what did you do? 
Cleaver: I packed up; I cleaned out 
our house and packed it up and stored 
the stuff. Then, I flew to Los Angeles. 

NJ: The two children? 
Cleaver: I had sent them earlier. 

NJ: They were old enough that you had 
to try to explain to them what was going 
on. 
Cleaver: Yes. 

NJ: Was it hard? 
Cleaver: It wasn't hard; they couldn't 
really understand. You can always tell 
them their Daddy's going to jail. They 
didn't get it. They didn't like Nixon too 
much. They figured somehow he was 
connected. They had a very infantile 
understanding, but they were there 
when he surrendered, so they saw him 
on television, they saw him being hand-
cuffed. They saw him being taken off. 
They'd go and visit him in jail. They 
wanted to know. They'd ask, "Daddy, 
did you kill somebody?" and he'd say 
"No." "Well, that's what they said on the 
news." You know these types of things.

You know, there was a shoot-out. 
The case for which he was under indict-
ment was for participating in an en-
counter with the Oakland police in 
which one Black Panther was killed and 
eight Black Panther members were ar-
rested. I think there were 50 to 65 
(policemen] shooting at him. 

NJ: This is when your husband and 
Bobby Hutton were in a house? 
Cleaver: Yes, but there were other 
people there, they just ended up being 
trapped there. It was for that incident in 
Oakland for which he was going to 
stand trial. All the other people had 
already been tried, and the manner in 
which the case was handled was very 
hysterical. You can imagine "Armed 
black [men) in our city, threatening the 
police, threatening order.• The manner 
in which the police responded in 
Oakland exposed a lot of the things that 
the Black Panther party and the left 
were about, what they were against: 
violence. People hadn't really believed

"If eight years later It comes 
out In the press [that] the FBI 
conspired to kill you, you're 
not surprised." 

diat that's the way they operated until 
then. 

NJ: You're saying that the Black Pan-
thers were against violence at that 
point? 
Cleaver: They were against random 
and arbitrary police violence on the 
black community. Their position was 
that they should exercise self-defense. 
They shouldn't allow the police to be 
violent in the neighborhood. It became 
really a very vicious struggle over who 
was in charge. The police assumed they 
were in charge. They wanted to destroy 
any group that challenged their authori-
ty. The Panthers challenged it constant-
ly by their very existence. 

NJ: By carrying guns? 
Cleaver: At the time, that was legal, 
but they quickly insisted that the law be 
changed. So, the Panthers weren't car-
rying guns publicly, but they all owned 
guns. 

NJ: Was 
violence 
viewed as 
a 
legitimate means to achieve political 
ends? 
discrimination in terms of employment, 
education and housing. All of these 
things were very deliberately inter-
twined in a society that was violently 
disturbing black 
people. 

So, 
the 
response that the Black Panther party 
articulated was one of self-defense, not 
of passively protesting. If it came to a 
question of violence, then they should 
retaliate with violence. 

NJ: How did the transformation take 
place in your head from the non-violent 
and I was very idealistic. I had been 
brought up as a Christian; I was in a 
Quaker school and I really believed in 
the Bible. It seemed that there was a 
spiritual dimension in the civil rights 
struggle that I responded to. It was just 
for people not to be oppressed, so all we 
had to do was demonstrate to the people 
that they're doing wrong and by being 
gentle and Christian, you will shame 
your enemy into changing his ways. 
1 That's the basic philosophy of non-
violence. 

Cleaver: It's not that it's legitimate, 
but that it might be necessary. Prior to 
then, prior to the Black Panther party, 
the whole civil rights movement be-
lieved that they should pursue what 
they wanted by non-violent means. 
They should use political pressure, 
KaJhlem Cleaver takes notes in John Blum's Amenean Public Policy course 
marches, 
demonstrations, even civil 
disobedience. 

NJ: So what changed that? 
Cleaver: Well, the Black Panthers 
didn't believe that. We felt that all that 
had been accompanied by a lot of bru-
tality. The central issues, the real hard 
problems that black people had to deal 
with were crummy housing, indecent 
schools, total lack of political input, 
integrationalist tactics of Martin Luther 
King to the tactics of the Black Pan-
thers? 
Cleaver: When I became interested in 
the tactics of Martin Luther King, I was 
about 15 or 16 years old. 

NJ: This was in what year? 
Cleaver: 1962. I was in high school 

NJ: So what happened? How did that 
change? 
Cleaver: It didn't work that well. The 
enemy didn't seem to get transformed 
quickly enough. 

NJ: But it did get some specific legisla-
tion: the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 
Civil Rights Act. Things were moving.
