departmental appointments and pro-
motions and so on. 


However, the department has been 
accused of many lapses, and most 
often of condoning excessive brutal-
ity and illegal a.rrest procedures as 
standard practice. Charges of per-
jury in applying for search warrants, 
alteration of warrants once issued, 
search without warrant, and false 
arrest have appeared within increas-
ing frequency in the pages of the 
New Haven papers since 1971. 
"This may be ordinary relative to 
what goes on in other towns," notes 
New Haven lawyer John R. Wil-
liams, "but it's extraordinary rela-
tive to our expectations." Williams 
and his partner, Michael Avery, are 
the men most responsible for keeping 
the issue of police misconduct alive 
in New Haven. Since the fall of 1971, 
they have filed and tried a unique 
series of damage suits. The suits are 
designed to curtail illegal practices 
by bringing them into the open and 
by making them costly to the depart-
ment. 


A very and Williams discovered 
their common concern about police 
invasion of civil rights when both 
were defending minor figures in the 
Black Panther Party trials of 1970. 
Avery was a recent Yale College-
Yale Law School graduate working 
for the Connecticu t Civil Liberties 
Union; Williamshad recentlylefthis 
corporate law practice to work for 
New Raven's highly regarded legal 
assistance program. After the trials, 
they became partners in a firm now 
know as Williams, A very and Wynn. 
Most lawyers will not go out of 
their way to bring a damage action 
against the police. There isn't much 
money in it, and it can disrupt a 
smooth working relationship with 
the police, which may be essential in 
other areas of a law practice. 
Besides, individual lawsuits are not 
generally considered effective 
against a well-established pattern of 
misconduct. But Avery and 
Williams had a hunch that this 
method of restraining the police has 
not been successful because it had 
never been tried on a large enough 
scale. 


They began taking police lawsuits 
in preference to other cases. Their 
clients were mostly poor, and the 
attorneys accepted fees on a contin-
gency basis: no fees unless an award 
was made. Now, they have also ori-
ented their criminal practice toward 
cases involving possible police mis-
conduct. 


Today, with three dozen suits 
filed, and a dozen tried with an out-
standing fifty-per-cent success rate, 
A very and Williams are the focus of 
police-consciousness in New Haven. 
Together they run a clinic class at 
the Law School in which students 
work on police lawsuits; A very has 
taught a Calhoun College seminar on 
"Police and Police Conduct"; Wil-
liams is being sued for hbel by Chief 
DiLieto, and the J oumal-Courier 
comments that he is " noted for get-
ting his hands into police business." 
The method of fighting miscon-
duct in the courts has proved to have 
applications beyond the defense of 
Fourth Amendment rights. For 
example, while defending a police 
press agent who was ostensibly 
being discharged from the depart-
ment for shoplifting, Williams 
alleged that the department had 
tried to involve his client in a scheme 
to misrepresent auto theft statistics 
so that the police could qualify for 
more Federal Funds. This brought 
Williams two unexpected carbonÂ· 
copied arrest reports dated June 
1972, apparently stolen from police 
headquarters. The name of the 
offense on each report had been 
crossed out at headquarters and 
replaced with that of a milder 
offense. Williams sent the reports to 
the judge and gave copies to the 
press, thus helping to explain how 
Biagio DiLieto achieved a greater 
reduction in serious crimes than any 
other police chief in the nation in 
1972. DiLieto's dramatic success 
also meant more Federal funds 
for the New Haven department. 


Similarly, in a recent suit naming 
the Board of Police Commissioners 
as plaintiffs, Williams alleged that 
two members of the Board are in con-
flict of interest, since one (Dr. Luca 
Celentano) is in partnership with a 
police physician and the other 
(Clarence Butcher) is the department 
tailor. The suit strikes at the heart of 
the misconduct issue because the 
Board is a civilian body appointed by 
the Mayor and responsible for over-
seeing the conduct of the depart-
ment; historically, according to 
Michael Avery, "they have done 
what the Chief wanted them to do." 


Have the lawsuits been successful 
in their original purpose of protect-
ing citizens from brutality, illegal 
search and arrest? John Williams 
feels that there has been a signifi-
cant change, but there is still plenty 
of room for improvement. "There 
have been fewer warrantless searches 
of late," he says, "and certain dan-
gerous officers have been placed in 
less sensitive positions, so that 
extreme examples of brutality are 
less frequent." 


A very concurs, but feels that law-
suits alone can never accomplish all 
that needs to be done. "I'd like to 
see citizens' groups follow through 
on some of the work we do," says 
Avery; "I'd like to see citizens ask 
why officers found guilty of perjury 
are allowed to rE"main on the force, 
for example." (The reference is to 
Michael Giovanni, a detective found 
guilty of false statement in a false-
arrest suit that A very tried on behalf 
of Yale-New Haven inhalation thera-
pist Austin Martin. Chief DiLieto 
has stated that he does not intend to 
bring departmental charges against 
Giovanni.) 


"To change the natur.e of what the 
police do would require a concerend 
citizenry," says Avery. "People 
don't seem to understand the impor-
tance of the Fourth Amendment 
right to privacy; they don't realize 
that if that right is denied to drug 
addicts it can be denied to anybody. 
And you can't really protect people's 
rights for them." 0
