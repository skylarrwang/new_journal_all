The small stream at the pond's 
mouth became a chocolate-brown 
torrent; bits of sediment traveled 
downstream, under the barbed wire 
boundary, through the neighboring 
farm's upper pastures, under the 
Brownington Road, and into the long 
valley bisected by the highway. 


A yardstick stuck in the mud near 
the dock showed the progress of the 
war between my grandfather and the 
beavers. If the water level dropped 
below the number twenty-four it 
meant that the dam was broken and 
Grandfather was winning the battle 
to save his trees. But if the level rose, 
it meant that the dam held strong 
and the water was rising slowly, 
reaching out to drown new timber. 
Grandfather and I would break the 
dam with pickaxes every time we 
came to the Pond Property, only to 
discover it rebuilt, stronger, the next 
time we came. We never saw the 
beavers. They worked at night and 
slept in their lodge during the day. 
Occasionally we heard one of their 
firecracker tail-slaps in the distance, 
a warning signal they used whenever 
we got too close. One winter Grand-
father dynamited their lodge and had 
a trapper lay out underwater snares 
and steel traps. The snares drowned 
three beavers; the trapper found a 
chewed off toe in one of the traps. 
The beavers went away for a few 
years and Grandfather claimed vic-
tory, pointing with pride to a row of 
young tamarack trees that had 
sprouted in territory formerly held 
by the beavers. But the animals 
came back, the water level inched up-
ward, and the tamaracks turned 
brittle-brown and died. Grandfather 
capitulated; today the pond is high 
and spreading towards other trees. 


The spirits of the former owners of 
the Pond Property still walk the 
land, especially at dawn, before the 
mist lifts off the water and surround-
ing bog. Fifty years ago the land 
supported three farms: the Ainsboro 
Farm, the Lynch Farm, and the 
Napoleon Stone Farm. Only the rock 
foundations of the farmhouses re-
main, nothing remains of the barns. 
An occasional rusted pail, or stove-
top, or maple sugaring implement 
still pokes through the leaves on the 
ground. The pastures have all re-
verted to forest. 
During the 1940's a Jesuit Priest 
named Father Fortin turned part of 
the Pond Property into a summer 
camp for his parish. He cut walking 
trails through the woods, stocked the 
pond with rainbow trout, and bought 
an oversized rowboat that could hold 
twenty fishermen. The trout all went 
downstream one spring when the 
beaver dam broke, and today a sign 
tacked on a tree near the water sor-
rowfully declares NO FISH. Some of 
the Catholics in nearby Derby Line 
still consider the Pond Property 
theirs. Every fall whole groups of 
them break down the fence (ignoring 
the posted signs) and hunt rabbits 
and ruffed grouse. 


After the beavers' victory, Grand-
father never tried to do much else 
with the Pond Property. He cleared 
some land and planted spruce seed-
lings ten years ago and claims he can 
sell them today for eight dollars 
apiece. He's old now, over eighty, 
and his memory and stamina play 
tricks on him. Some days he wants to 
sell the land, some days he wants to 
buy more. He doesn't realize that 
when he threatens to sell the proper-
ty he's tampering with my future 
design, my Tara. 
My father used to sight his rifles 
during family outings to the proper-
ty. He would concentrate on his big 
varmint rifle, sitting at a table and 
aiming at targets set up two hundred 
yards across the pond. He would 
give me and my two brothers a car-
ton of ammunition each and a slen-
der .22 calibre rifle and let us plink 
at lily pads and beer cans. We'd 
blast at the water for hours. When 
we finished, late in the afternoon, 
even the crickets were quiet. 


Seeing your family's name on the 
POSTED POSTED POSTED signs 
that ring your property gives rise to 
thoughts of the future. How to justi-
fy owning 400 acres of land (a part of 
me says that there is something 
almost evil in keeping that much 
land), how to change it, how to make 
it pay. Future plans, all open-ended 
and hazy: 
•lumbering 
• raising Christmas trees 
• stocking the pond with fish again, 
refurbishing the cottage and rent-
ing it to hunters and fishermen 
• bulldozing new access roads and 
selling segments of the land 
• tapping the three groves of sugar 
maples, nearly 3000 trees, for 
maple syrup 
Letting the land sit. Keeping it wild, 
knowing it's yours. 0

ployed, would like uery much to 
spend the rest of his life raising trees 
in Vermont.
