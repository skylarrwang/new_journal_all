**Title: Eugene McCarthy's Unfinished Business**
**Author: Erik Lazar**
**Page number(s): 3- [unclear]**

Seven years after the Revolution, 
Eugene McCarthy is out of place. In 
January, 1968 he was in New Hamp-
shire, travelling about the state, 
shaking hands, orating-challenging 
the President of the United States. 
The press surrounded him. They 
took his picture. He was in all the 
papers. Now, 58, he was with me, 
alone, sitting in the belly of a New 
York to Washington shuttle. We Â· 
went tourist class. 

McCarthy had just finished busi-
ness in the City. He lives in Wash-
ingtori but every week he flies north 
to teach at the New School for Social 
Research where he holds the Adlai 
Stevenson Chair of Political Science.  
I had gone to the lecture the night 
before. New School types filled the 
audito~um: middle-aged, attentive, 
eternally liberal. Professor McCarthy 
went on for two hours on James 
Baldwin's Nobody Knows My_Name. 
A breath of fresh air. 

Academics seemed like a good 
topic to start a conversation. I asked 
him about his job. 
" It's almost over," he replied. "A 
few more weeks and that's it. I'll be 
glad when it's over. All this flying is 
tough work. What about the Chair? 
Oh, I dunno. It's a traditional thing, I 
suppose. There's no real connection 
between the title and me. Adlai and 
I - we don't have that much in com-
mon, you know. 
"True," loffered, " butyouwere 
both considered intellectuals.'' 

life- he was elected to Congress in 
1948- he still retains the look of a 
scholar, conscientiously perhaps. His 
silver hair and blue, vaea.nt eyes 
make him look smart. 

As the plane lifted off and flew cir-
cles over Manhattan, McCarthy ex-
plained his attitude about study: 
"It's good to reflect on things. Like a 
poem or a book. In college I wrote an 
essay on Swift's view of women. Now 
I don't know what relation it had to 
contemporary pr9blems but the 
thought itself was good." He empha-
sized good. ''An example-I once 
taught a course before the war, 
"Readings in Social Thought." 

Years later a student of mine came 
up to me- a real estate agent. You 
know what book he said influenced 
him the most? Vision of Piers Plow-
man- 13thor 14th century. It was 
the only testament I ever had on it." 

McCarthy has little time to read 
now. He is involved in another poli-
tical distraction. Four months ago he 
announced his candidacy for Pres-
-ident with the support of a " third 
force" movement- "The Committee 
for a Constitutional Presidency." In 
front of a thousand students at the 
University of Wisconsin, he recalled 
memories of Chi~go. At that time, 
after Hubert Humphrey had won the 
Democratic nomination, McCarthy 
took a walk. Crossing the street in 
front of his hotel, he entered Grant 
Park where a group of protestors 
with a microphone waited. He stop-
ped for a moment. Turning to some 
cameras, he held up a peace sign. 
After a while, he spoke. 

Now in Wisconsin, McCarthy was 
using the same words. "I have often 
referred to my supporters as a gov-
ernment in exile," he said. "And now 
perhaps our time to return has 
come." He omitted t he closing t hat 
he had used in Grant Park, however; 
defeated and in doubt , he had asser-
ted, " I will speak out on the issues as 
long as I have a constituency. And I 
still have a constituency. " 

McCarthy told me he would stop 
by his headquarters that afternoon. I 
suggested, jokingly, that we were 
flying between the poles of his aca-
demic and political life. "What is the 
relationship," I asked. 
"Another example,'' he said. "We 
suffer now in American politics be-
cause many decisions are made with-
out reference to historical or philo-
sophical reflection. In the entire de-
bate in Congress on the volunteer 
army, there wasn't one reference to 
the classical treatises on the merce-
nary army. Now, at the Constitution-
al Convention, you would have had 
men like Washington, Jefferson, and 
Jay reflecting on what Aristotle had 
to say, or Plato, or Machiavelli. Even 
de Toqueville .... '' 

"Oh, yes," McCarthy said. "But 
Adlai was more ... political. Teaching 
was my original commitment , you 
know. Before I got into politics I had 
intended to spend my whole life in 
the academic world. I was finishing a 
dissertation on medieval history 
when the distraction came on. I 
never got back to it." 

He appeared sad at the thought. 
His voice trailed off, and he turned 
to the window. We were now some-
where over New Jersey, but clouds 
obscured the view of the ground 
McCarthy stared. 

Academics are important to him-
hypotheses, convolutions. Although 
he has been a politician most of his 
" Well which do you prefer," I said. 
" Aeadeinics or politic:J. '.' 
McCarthy laughed. "Oh, I dunno,"
