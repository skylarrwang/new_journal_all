**Making It in a ''Man's'' World**

For the past two months, I have been treated to 
lunch five times and dinner twice at the New York 
Yale Club, by classmates making from $17,000 to 
$20,000 a year their first four to eighteen months 
on the job. I have had intense, serious discussions 
over cups of tea and cappucino about work, sue· 
cess, power, the balance between career and per· 
sonallife, and Yale's influence or lack of it on 
these questions. I have interviewed three bankers, 
two lawyers, four law students, several graduate 
students (in Chinese literature, American history 
and public health), a librarian, an economist, an 
assistant to a theatre producer, a magazine editor 
and an advertising consultant. Second hand, I 
have heard about two classmates who started a 
half-way house for the retarded, a legal aid lawyer 
busy sixty hours a week, a Wall Street lawyer who 
worked the Fourth of July, an actress whose 
answering service says she's in Hollywood, a poet 
who founded an experimental literary magazine, 
a former feminist who had a church wedding, a 
lending officer who took a course at Cordon Bleu, 
a secretary in a factory married to a foreman, two 
typists who denied they were just "typing, 
11 an 
heiress working on a documentary of the Ameri· 
can Nazi Party, a psychiatrist at a V.A. hospital, 
an editor of Viva and a writer whose first book, 
Memoirs of a Yale Woman was rejected after two 
drafts by Harper and Row, and who is writing her 
second, Memoirs of a Cleaning Woman, while 
driving a school bus. Everyone was frank, en· 
grossed in our discussions, eager for gossip about 
other classmates and generous with credit cards. 

The fact that everyone I interviewed was fe· 
male should not be surprising; Yale women are 
used to considering themselves the equals of their 
male counterparts, and used to being written to 
death in the media. What did surprise me was that 
so few women were devoted to their work (ob· 
sessed with it, if you will). All were anxious about 
success; but few could put conflicts about com-
petition with lovers and husbands and the diffi· 
culty of combining careers with children out of 
their minds. Some even seemed tormented. The 
men they knew (and their male classmates) 
worked first and worried, if at all, in their spare 
time. 

Yale's ftrst "coeds" transferred into the 
junior class and graduated in 1971. In an article in 
the New York Times Magazine, April13, 1969, 
"How Yale Selected her First Coeds," the appli· 
cants were described as "a female version of 
Nietzche's Uebermensch" by author John Lear, 
'70. For some reason, that phrase stuck. "Coed" 
didn't. In presenting this view of the class of 1971 
and their work, four years later, I must confess 
two biases: I wanted my classmates to be 1) 
strong women and 2) happy people. I did not, I'm 
glad to say, meet any superwomen. 

Karen, the first and only woman attorney 
' • 
in a small Park A venue firm, met me in one of 
those East Side restaurants where you can't linger 
over your $2.50 hamburger. She loves her work, 
but said, "I do see my career as hopefully inter-
rupted. I don't feel a conflict between personal life 
and career, however, since I haven't had to deal 
with it yet. The men I know, my colleagues, see no 
interruptions." She spent the rest of lunch com· 
plaining that her job is to a large extent her iden· 
.1
tity-she has found few male counterparts who 
can hold their own against her, and this makes her 
uncomfortable. But then she adds, "there's no 
question that my attitude is very sexist. 
11 She 
assumes that any man she would marry would be 
more capable than she is; otherwise, she wouldn't 
give up her career. 

Anne, a lending officer in a New York bank, 
A
met me in the middle of a crisis -an African com-
pany she oversees was crumbling. "It's been a 
harrowing morning, but I'm challenged by this." 
Since Yale, where she lacked confidence among 
male "magnas and summas" in an intensive 
major, she has come into her own, says a col· 
league, and "will make a magnificent banker."
