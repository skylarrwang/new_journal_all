he answered. "You find some of 
these people who go from academics 
to politics who enjoy the power. But 
I don't think you can sort it out." 
He has another occupation. He 
writes poetry. During the 1968 cam-
paign he was labeled a poet-politician 
for his efforts. The tag had some 
truth to it. During the height of the 
Indiana primary he secluded himself 
in a motel room, scratching out lines. 
His staff, wanting positions for press 
statements, searched furiously but 
couldn't find him. 

Often McCarthy took rides with 
poet Robert Lowell~ his favorite com-
panion. He wrote Lowell a poem, 
praising him as "the double agent of 
doubt, smuggler of truth." Lowell, in 
turn, responded by writing the intro-
duction of McCarthy's only book ot 
verse, Other Things and the Aard-
vark, published after the defeat. 
Extra copies are now sold to raise the 
money for the new campaign. 

"I'm not what you would call a 
full-time poet," he explained. But he 
does have a poet's pride. He was de-
fensive when he said, "But there 
have been a lot of poets who aren't 
full time. Look, evenT .S. Eliot 
worked in a bank. 

"What bothers me is that some 
politicians refer to me as a poet with 
some disdain as if poetry and politics 
don't go together. Abraham Lincoln 
wrote three major poems published 
anonymously. So you can make a 
cheap argument-Abraham Lincoln 
was the greatest President and he 
was also a poet. It doesn't prove any-
thing except that people shouldn't 
go around talking nonsense about 
poetry and politics." 

Over Pennsylvania, the plane be-
gan to descend. Soon we were mak-
ing an approach to the Capitol and I 
asked McCarthy why he is run-
ning-again. 

He didn't answer for several mo-
ments. Then he spoke, his tone 
guarded, political: "When you've 
been in politics for 25 years as I 
have, you don't want to leave it with-
out making a final challenge, espe-
cially when the government is in 
such a state of affairs as it is now. 
Looking towards '76 it is obvious 
that there is a need for something. 
The Democrats are hopeless." 

He recalled 1968, bitterly. "At 
Chicago the party repudiated the will 
of the people. Between Kennedy and 
I, we had captured the majority of 
the votes. And then in 1972 you had 
the McGovern thing. It was essen-
tially a takeover operation. Once 
they had won, they said, now the 
party is us. Well, you can't do that. 
It's a personalization of the cam-
paign -everything I have been 
arguing against for years." 

"But wasn't McGovern represen-
tative of what people wanted?" 

"Well, that depends on what you 
mean. He didn't represent me. I tes-
tified before the platform committee 
in Miami. When I finished, I ran into 
a McGovern man outside who told 
me the platform was already written. 
I said, "Well I'm glad to know how 
much attention my recommenda· 
tions are going to get." 

"Do you really think you can 
. ?" 
wm. 

"Of course. One third of the people 
in this country consider themselves 
independent. They don't believe in 
either party. That's a chance right 
there, isn't it?" 

He was serious until the shuttle 
settled down on the Washington run-
way. When we arrived at the term· 
inal, he reached for the overhead coat 
rack and his white raincoat. Walking 
down the aisle, he straightened his 
tie and changed; once again he was 
the professor, metaphorical and iron-
ical. 

"Winning in American politics is 
like Latin American revolutions,'' he 
TheNewJoumal/April25, 1975 
said. "It all depends on who captures 
the radio and television stations 
first." He smiled at the thought. 

McCarthy has his headquarters on 
1223 Connecticut A venue, the bow-
els of downtown Washington. The 
area is filled with confusion-govern-
ment buildings, business offices, 
small shops, congested streets. 1223 
is hard to find; a small brownstone, 
it is squeezed between two large 
storefronts, a sewing shop and a res-
taurant which sells bread and soup. 

McCarthy parked his car across 
the street, under a No Parking sign. 
"I use this so I won't get towed," he 
told me, placing a rusting Member of 
Congress plate under the windshield. 

To reach the third floor, one has 
alternatives-a staircase or an old 
elevator which occasionally gets 
stuck on its way up. "I usually use 
the stairs," McCarthy said, opening 
the elevator door. "My secretary 
says we might lose the candidate in 
this thing." 

The Committee Secretary is Sue 
Hatt, 68, old, gray, and a socialist of 
sorts. She works at the Committee 
full time, volunteer. When McCarthy 
...

walked in, she frowned. "You look 
horrible," she,said. "Have you eaten 
today?" 

McCarthy shook his head, be-
mused by the observation-Ron Co-
combe, a young man who serves as 
Committee Chairman and looks like 
a mathematician, tried to welcome 
McCarthy over the diatribe. 

"Well eat some of this," said Hatt, 
continuing. She pulled a piece of 
bread and a carrot from a pile of food 
on her desk. McCarthy examined the 
offering; he bit the carrot, but slip-
ped the slice into his pocket. Munch-
ing, he disappeared into Cocombe's 
office. 

I was observing the scene when 
Hatt interrupted my notetaking. 
"You don't look like the other re-
porters," she told me. "So don't"ask 
him stupid questions." 

"Like what?" I asked. 

"You know," she said. "Like why 
he didn't support Humphrey earlier 
in 1968. Like why is he like Harold 
Stassen. Just don't ask him any 
stupid questions. He's so intelligent, 
you know." 

I promised I wouldn't and was re-
warded with a tour of the offices. 
They were impressive for a new or-
ganization. Seven large rooms led off 
a twisting corridor. Most were deco-
rated with McCarthy relics from 
1968 and his abortive run in the 1972 
Illinois primary. "Gene McCarthy-
A Breath of Fresh Air" was promi-
nently displayed. New posters were 
due. 

The office is usually staffed by six 
people; only two are paid. Karen 
Gibsen, 20, is typical of the recruits 
for the new crusade. A junior from 
Kent State, she is on leave and works 
at the Committee on weekends. 
Dressed in a turtleneck and cordu-
roys, she bent over a desk, filling out 
notecards for a mailing list. She 
wouldn't stop working to talk. 

"In 1968 I was in Akron Ohio," 
she told me. "Just sitting, watching 
the Chicago riots on TV at home. I 
was sick to my stomach. But I 
wasn't what you call politically 
aware. Whv do I like McCarthy? I 
don't know. I trust him, I guess. 
And I'm so afraid of Jackson.'' 

While McCarthy made phone 
calls, Cocombe explained the Com-
mittee and its strategy. 

"Most of us here came out of Chi-
cago," he said. "We knew then that 
we couldn't work within the two-
party system. Our aim is to prove a 
third force can win. McCarthy is not 
going to go through the primaries. 
We are organizing volunteers all over 
the country, getting petitions to put 
the Senator on the ballot. Then we 
will keep him active through a public 
speaking tour. He's leaving tomor-
row for West Virginia and Mississip-
pi. Do we expect to get on all the 
ballots? Not really. You know, you 
only need 15 states to win." 

"Do you believe you can win?" I 
.asked. "Realistically." 

Cocombe thought for a moment. 
"Oh, reality," he said. "Now that's 
not much fun, is it?" 

The next morning I visited Mc-
Carthy at his home in Georgetown. 
He lives in a large, colonial, brick 
structure on Q Street. I rang three 
times before McCarthy answered the 
door. "I thought it was unlocked," 
he said "The maid usually leaves it 
that way when she goes." 

McCarthy lives by himself, up-
stairs. His study is modest: a bare 
wood floor with two small rugs, a 
writing desk, a kitchen to the side, 
and a wall of bookshelves. These are 
lined with an assortment of political, 
philosophical, and literary works; 
the most prominent are Joyce's 
Ulysses, The Complete Oxford Eng-
lish Dictionary, McCarthy's Year of 
the People, translated into French, 
German, and Portuguese, and, prop-
ped up by a medallion of St. Thomas 
More, volumes of Aquinas. Above 
his desk are two grey ink portraits, 
one of Joyce, the other of Walt Whit-
man. "You know who those are, 
don't you," he said, pointing to 
them. 

At eight in the morning, McCar-
thy was tired. He sat in his desk 
chair, draping his arms over his 
knee. I asked him whether Vietnam 
would be discussed in his campaign. 
He got up and walked into the 
kitchen. "That's a dead issue by 
now, •' the voice came from inside. 

We did not have much time to 
talk, however, as an aide arrived to 
take him to National Airport. 

In the car I asked him what he 
thought he would be remembered for 
if he loses. "Oh, I dunno," he said. 
"The 1968 movement, I suppose. 
Then he outlined his entire Senate 
career-his fights against pollution, 
his early stand against Joe McCar-
thy, his call in 1954 for an investiga-
tion of the CIA. "I took all these 
issues on before it was popular to do 
so," he said. "But really, it's too 
much to go into here." 

We crossed an empty bridge over 
the Potomac. Nearing the airport, I 
decided to ask the forbidden ques-
tion. "Senator, do you really want 
to be President?" 

McCarthy, as predicted, winced. 
"What it comes down to is whether 
I have the desire to be President or 
not. People in the press would say I 
don't have the desire. But they also 
say-look, he's like Harold Stassen. 
But I don't think it's necessary to go 
around with your tongue hanging 
out saying, 'I want to be President.' 
People like Walter Mondale say they 
can't stand living out of Holiday 
Inns. Well, I don't mind them a bit." 

National Airport was empty. A 
few people recognized McCarthy as 
he passed through the lobby. They 
stood at a respectful distance, star-
ing. Bu.t most didn't notice or seem 
to care. McCarthy sat down in a long 
row of vacant seats in the departure 
lobby, waiting for his plane to Cum-
berland. He began to scribble notes 
on the back of an envelope. It would 
be the substance of a speech he 
would give later at a labor union 
meeting. 

When his departure was an-
nounced, he put the envelope in a 
brown leather valise. On it, printed 
in small gold letters, were the words: 
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
Happiness. "Well, fella," he said, 
getting up and extending a hand, 
"Good luck." It was a final ironic 
gesture. He then turned, disappear-
ing down a long marble corridor-
alone. O
