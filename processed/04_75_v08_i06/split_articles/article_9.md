Wilderness Notes 
by David DeVeau Sleeper 
I remember being afraid of the land 
in back of my house in Larchmont, 
New York- a fifteen acre triangle of 
scrub-choked fields and forest. We 
called it (quite naturally) The 
Woods, and until I was five or six I 
never walked there alone, too fright-
ened of hawks, raccoons, possums 
and other wild creatures I didn't 
understand. Three rock formations 
marked the boundaries of my child-
hood wilderness : a glacier-left boul-
der that the neighborhood kids called 
Big Rock, an exposed section of bed-
rock named Flat Rock, and towards 
the south, rising a hu.ndred feet in 
the air was the biggest landmark of 
all, a rock we considered almost a liv-
ing thing-King Kong. We spent 
long afternoons hunting in The 
Woods, first for rabbits and pheas-
ants (using sticks for rifles) and in 
later years for each other, in all-day 
wars with Daisy pump action air 
guns and plastic Army carbines. 

As I got older TheW oods got 
smaller, chunk by chunk carved out 
by bulldozers and steam shovels for 
streets with names like Winding 
Brook Drive and Woods Way, and 
split-level houses with seedstore 
lawns. I still remember hearing the 
muffled explosions echoing over 
what were left of the fields when the 
building contractors destroyed King 
Kong.

out of which man has hammered the 
artifact called ciuilization. " 
Aldo Leopold in A Sand 
County Almanac 
I was lost on my own land. My dog 
and I had turned south from the old 
beaverkill and found the red plastic 
tags nailed to the trees that/marked 
the Pond Property's bounjary. We 
had followed the tags ( anii sections 
of barbed wire so old they were. em-
bedded in the trees) for a distance of 
two hundred yards, detoured around 
a stretch of swampy land, and then 
lost the boundary. I backtracked but 
still couldn't find the tags or the 
wire. I sat down on a fallen tree and 
stared at the topographical map of 
northern Vermont my grandfather 
had given me when I told him I 
wanted to explore the property. I 
glanced up at the sun and felt a bit 
foolish because its position in the sky 
didn't mean anything to me. Then I 
looked at my dog-a suburban bred 
collie who follows rather than leads 
when walking through a forest. She 
was sitting patiently, head cocked, 
and waiting for me to continue. I was 
lost, completely lost, and I couldn't 
help but smile. 

I've been thinking about land late-
ly-my land; really my grand-
father's land, four hundred acres of 
Vermont forest, with a two acre pond 
and a cottage slowly being gnawed 
apart by porcupines and the long 
winters. No one lives there. My 
grandparents prefer to stay fifteen 
miles away in the more civilized sur-
roundings of town or at their sum-
mer place on Lake Memphremagog. 
The Pond Property just sits; its 
clearings turn inexorably back into 
forest, the old logging roads run with 
mud in the spring and grow jungles 
of weeds in the summer. The beavers 
build and rebuild their series of 
dams, the otters play tag, the hawks 
circle, the deer (though seldom seen) 
leave their tracks everywhere. Tres-
passing hunters scatter red, 
yellow, and blue shell casings 
about, and local teenage couples 
break down the front gate with 
their cars, searching out places to 
park in privacy. A hundred year old 
farmhouse falls down and disappears 
amid the second growth of spruce, 
maple, and pine trees. The hop house 
fell apart ten years ago; the old 
sugar liouse looks as if it will last for-
ever. The Pond Property sits, with 
its owls and spirits and stands of 
· white pine; family members visit the 
property only sporadically. Last year 
my grandfather tried to sell it. I 
didn't fully understand my fear- or 
my anger.

My grandfather, a retired WalJ 
Street insurance broker who lived in 
Scarsdale and vacationed in Ver-
mont, bought the Pond Property in 
three installments starting in 1961. 
According to his records, he paid the 
three previous owners an average of 
$27.50 an acre. Now, since the com-
pletion of Interstate Highway 91, 
which passes within five miles of the 
front gate, the land is probably 
worth ten times that amount. He 
still smiles every time he talks about 
his initial investment. 

"If you're not connected to the 
yearly protein resurrection, the 
calues being born, the plants push-
ing up through the ground after the 
long winter, you haue a hard time 
hauing any real hope for anything ... 
I'll stay on this piece of land as long 
as I can. When I work out there I 
know that land is what it's all based 
on. I know the sky, know when it's 
going to rain. You want to be in 
touch with something like this ... " 
Ken Kesey, in an interview 
from his farm in Oregon 
Excerpts from a letter my grand-
father sent the local tax assessors in 
1961: 
"It is our intention to maintain 
this property as a permanent family 
investment as forest land coopera-
ting with both state and federal 
authorities in the application of 
modem methods and practices of 
tree farming. , 

Grandfather had visions of milk-
ing immediate profit from his pur-
chase. He wasn't content to sit back 
and let time spiral the land's worth 
steadily upward-he hadn't bought 
it as real estate. In 1962 he commis-
sioned a firm to take extensive aerial 
photos of the la.nd. Then he had a 
man from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture look at the photos and 
walk the property with him to ap-
praise the trees. Lumber: living, 
growing profit; waiting to be cut 
down, hauled out, and sold; red 
spruce, white spruce, northern hard-
woods, white and red pine, balsam. 
They found that several valuable 
stands of timber fringed the two acre 
pond. It was then that the war 
started, between my profit-seeking 
grandfather and the beavers. 

I felt incredibly powerful when I 
first broke the beaver dam. By 
pulling three or four sticks out of the 
dam's mud-packed base I was able to 
start the water spilling out. The 
rushing water then pulled loose more 
sticks and mud until tons of water 
escaped through the breach, empty-
ing the 25 acre bog that the beavers 
had created around the main pond.
