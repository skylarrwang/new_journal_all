Getting More Friends for the Family 
by Nancy Kempner Davis 
" $97 MILLION FOR YALE/ 26% 
OF GOAL" screams the cover of 
"The Campaign for Yale's Bulletin 
Two," mailed to all of the approxi-
mately 90 thousand Alumni. This is 
correct. What follows is not. "The 
Campaign For Yale has raised $97 
million in ten months- over a quar-
ter of its $370 million goal." 

Kingman Brewster officially 
opened the Campaign in April197 4, 
ten months before this statement 
was made. He said, "I am happy to 
announce we start this campaign 
with commitments or gifts of $63 
million applicable to the campaign 
goal." This $63 million must be sub-
tracted from the $97 million total. 

In ten months the Campaign for 
Yale has raised $34 million. Included 
after April1974, was the $15 million 
grant from John Hay Whitney, '26, 
intended for two residential colleges 
but stymied by the New Haven 
Board of Aldermen since 1973 when 
they invoked the so-called Guida 
..... .. 
\ 
~. 
Amendment. This $15 million must 
be subtracted from the $34 million 
total. 

Yale has raised $19 million. The 
Alumni Fund contributed six million 
it has raised independently during 
that ten month period. This $6 mil-
lion must be subtracted from the $19 
million total. 

Yale has raised $13 million. 

The Campaign takes care of its 
own. In a university where furniture 
is re-cycled indefinitely, the Cam-
paign for Yale's headquarters at 155 
Whitney A venue have been decor-
ated. Before the executive staff 
moved in earlier this year, the ceil-
ing was tom up to install individual 
air conditioner ducting to each office. 
The carpet is wall to wall bronze shag. 
At least 14 new beige I.B.M. selec-
trics sit on new formica and chrome 
desks. 

A jovial, shoulder-to-the-wheel 
spirit is cultivated. The executives 
work with their doors open. They 
wave, shake hands, and clap each 
other on the back. The secretaries, 
clustered in groups of three and four, 
chatter and laugh. But two junior 
level executives and one secretary 
refuse to discuss their work. They 
are afraid of being fired. They sug-
gest directing all questions to 
Donald M. Marshman, Director of 
Information. 

A huge, slightly stooped man, 
"Mac" Marshman has had a varied 
career. He won an Oscar in collabora-
tion with Billy Wilder for the screen· 
play of "Sunset Boulevard," starring 
Gloria Swanson. After a stint as an 
editor at Time Inc., he worked for 
Young and Rubican, and owned his 
own advertising agency. When the 
Campaign is won, he says, he may 
retire. 

Mr. Marshman does not have the 
exact figures on how much the Cam-
paign has cost. "I don't think it 
would be appropriate to tell you even 
if I knew. Our total ceiling for Cam· 
paign expenditures is four percent.'' 
He affirms that he means four per· 
cent of the $97 million. "That's nor-
mal-what other colleges spend. Of 
course, the United Fund drive is 
lower, but remember-we're not a 
local outfit." 

The Campaign for Yale has offices 
in New York and Chicago. Another 
will probably open soon in San Fran· 
cisco. "In the later stages of the 
Campaign," says Chief Executive 
Officer John Perry Miller, ''we will 
be in Akron, Detroit, Milwaukee-
over 60 cities in all. You have no idea 
how much money there is in Milwau· 
kee." The Campaign does not plan 
full ecale offices in these citiee. lt 
hopes to establiah volunteer orpni· 
zations. 

"Is three and a baH million a fair 
estimate?'~ I ask, thinking of the four 
·percent expenditure, aDd remember-
ing that· the Campaip ~ coetma a

man sipe hia coffee. .. Yea," be .. ,.. 
That ficure was later corrected to 
be two million clollan . 


The Campaign has a three-part 
plan. To quote Bulletin One, also 
mailed to the 90 thousand alumni: 
"First Year. Seek Leadership 
Uifts ($500,000 and above); enlist 
volunteers and develop plans, 
material and staff for subsequent 
years. 

Second Year. Commence solicita-
tion of Major Gifts ($50,000 and 
above), continue Leadership Gifts 
efforts and prepare for across-the-
board solicitation to follow. 

Third Year. This is the Special 
Gifts stage of the Campaign in which 
all alumni, parents and friends who 
have not been solicited previously 
will be asked to make their special 
capital pledge." 

John Perry Miller's is the corner 
office, reached through an anteroom 
where his secretary works. She is the 
only secretary with her own room. 
(Elsewhere at Yale, power is mea· 
sured by proximity to President 
Brewster in Woodbridge Hall; at the 
Campaign it is how close one is to 
Mr.Miller.) The Campaign also rents 
close to six thousand square feet on 
the third floor, used mainly for the 
researchers and the Campaign's 
massive file system. 

Before Mr. Miller can speak, the 
phone rings. It is the Los Angeles 
Yale Alumni Organization. The pro-
fits from the international preview of 
a Paul Newman (Drama '51) film will be 
donated to the Campaign. Might 
Brewster fly out for the gala? Mr. Miller 
considers. 

As he hangs up, he explains. "I 
had to say no. It won't bring in more 
than eighteen thousand. I can't fly 
Brewster across for that. He gives us 
lot's of his time-he says people 'like to 
see the headwaiter'-but that wouldn't 
be using it well." He shakes his head, 
shrugs and says, "I'm sorry." 

Mr. Miller is round, with white 
hair. He bounces in his chair. He 
wears monogrammed shirts with 
french cuffs and suits made in Hong 
Kong. Dean of theY ale Graduate 
School(1961-1969), the reason for 
hiring him is that he comes from the fa-
culty side of the fence, while he is also a 
highly regarded administrator and has 
been successful as a fundraieer. He wants 
to retire when the Campaign ends. 

"So far we've concentrated on the 
Big Guns, the Leadership Gifts. We 
go after them very carefully. We've 
received 22 commitments totaling 66 
million dollars. Each person is 
approached individually. 

"We go to his frieDds, his businees 
partner, his college roommate and 
find out how much he's worth. We 
learn if he was on crew,. in a secret. 
society. Maybe be'e mter.ted ia the

mood. Or if he's shy, a friend might 
ring him up and invite him to lunch 
with one of our staff. We can go to 
him-or we're happy to show him 
around Yale. 

"But we've got to be careful. Lots 
of times someone will write us a 
$50,000 check without waiting to 
hear from us. That's bad. We call it 
defensive giving. 

"We want the Big Guns-the ones 
we know could manage a couple of 
million-to give until it hurts." Mr. 
Miller smiles whenever he says "mil-
lion." 

He thinks a minute. "No, no I 
don'tmean that. Wewantpeopleto 
give until it's fun. Yes, fun. How so? 
It's fun to achieve .... Yale alumni are 
great achievers: two presidents, nine 
Senators, lots of honors .... A million 
dollar donation is an achievement. A 
man might like to see his name on 
the wall in Sterling." 

Mr. Miller refuses to divulge the 
names of any Leadership Gifts 
donors. "I don't think it's appropri-
ate to publish their names in your 
magazine. They will be made public 
eventually, in something with a 
major scope." 

"We have gotten money from all 
the 'friends of the family,' "says Mr. 
Marshman. "The friends of the fam-
ily are those on the corporation, 
people who know and are concerned 
about Yale. The ones who call us up 
and say, 'How much do you need?'-
The ones Brewster has asked." 

A member of the faculty who 
works in the administration ex-
plained: "Brewster is tired. He 
wants to retire. He stuck it out 
through the sixties and May Day. 
He kept the campus cool, did a great 
job. But Yale is broke-we're oper-
ating at a deficit. He's got to stay 
until Yale's on its feet financially. He 
can't quit and leave the next presi-
dent holding the bag. 

"Think about it. Have you seen 
Brewster in the news lately, around 
campus? He used to make speeches 
all the time, and visit each Yale col-
lege every month. He doesn't bother 
any more. He's spending most of his 
time on the Campaign -raised a lot 
of money himself." 

How much of the $65 million in 
Leadership Gifts has Brewster raised 
personally? Mr. Miller grimaces. "I 
won't say. It's impossible to esti-
mate anyway. It's all done in collab-
oration." 

Can you give an approximation? 
Mr. Miller sighs. "The bulk of it. 
Let's just say the bulk of it." 

A senior member of the adminis-
tration close to Brewster who wishes 
to remain anonymous makes what he 
terms "a very conservative guess .... 
Kingman is independently respon-
sible for at least $50 million." 

The Campaign for Yale put $97 
million in the University's coffers, 
and has spent two million in the pro-
cess. Included in the total are $15 
million from Jock Whitney and $6 
million from the Alumni Fund. Of 
the $74 million remainder, $65 millit>n 
lion comes from Leadership Gifts. 
Subtracting the anonymous estimate 
of $50 million personally raised by 
President Brewster, the Campaign 
for Yale has earned a maximum of 
$24 million for the University's 
use. 

Mr. Miller looks tired for a 
moment. "The easy money's all in." 

The Campaign for Yale is big bus-
iness. It employs 75 people. But 
most of the solicitation in the next 
two stages of the Campaign must be 
done by volunteers. David Atcheson, 
Executive Secretary of Leadership 
Gifts thinks the core of the 'Old Boy' 
network which will raise money is 
the Yale Development Board, 
because "the men on its are tops; in 
industry, business, on the Street." 

Mr. Atcheson has the memory of a 
well programmed computer. Several 
alumni names are mentioned at ran-
dom; to the first he tags class, room-
mate, and profession. Of the second 
he remembers only class and secret 
society. He apologizes. 

"Through the Board we can almost 
always find a connection to a rich 
man. We can offer him any option; a 
gift from his corporation for business 
gifts, through the class fund, even by 
the Parent's fund." 

The Campaign is proud of a book-
let they titled • •y ale College Admis-
sions ... Alumni, Athletics, Financial 
Aid, Minorities, etc ... " It explains 
that with the possible exception of 
the class of '50, never has Yale 
accepted more alumni children than 
for '78. Says Mr. Marshman, "Not 
speaking to the political issues at all, 
Inky Clark was a bad administrator. 
We pay for that with angry alumni." 

The Campaign is preparing for the 
mass solicitation. Mr. Marshman 
explains how: "Let's take Worcester 
Massachusetts. No particular 
reason." He crosses his arms behind 
his head. "Bound to be alums there. 
We contact a few, ask one to chair 
theW orcester Drive of the Cam-
paign for Yale. Then he gets six or 
soY ale men from the area together 
at his club in the late afternoon, or 
at his home at night. We send a staff 
man up with a list of all the Yale 
grads we know of in Worcester. 
Often they can add a few names. The 
meat though, is what they know
page 11 
about what he's worth, how he might 
like to be approached, how much to 
ask. We have three men traveling 
full time." He shakes his head. 

"They're under tremendous pressure 
to sell." Mr. Miller does not know 
how many of the approximately 90 
thousand Alumni rate a dossier in 
Campaign files. He refuses to ask hi~ 
research staff. 

Eventually, all Yale graduates will. 
be listed in University fundraising 
files. A file would include class, 
major, names of roommates and 
friends, as well as extra-curricular 
activities. Each alumnus's job and 
earnings, if known, will be recorded 
along with estimated net worth. 

Mr. Marshman does not know how 
the ftle system works. "Basically 
when there's a red dot-or its equi-
valent-by the name on the cover it 
means 'Anything goes. The sky's the 
limit! A possible Kline' (as in Biol-
ogy Tower). There are a hell of a lot 
of red dots in those files.'' 

The Campaign for Yale's three 
year goal will be met in part through 
institutions. Business gifts must 
earn $20 million, foundation grants 
should total $40 million. The com-
mittee has just been formed. Robin 
Winks, an English professor on half 
academicleave from the University, 
directs this part of the Campaign. 
He does not know how much the 
Foundation Gifts Drive has earned. 
"About two million -check with Mil-
ler, he's got the figures. "The 
Alumni Fund plans to turn over to 
the Campaign $27 million which they 
earned separately. The are on 
schedule so far. 

These combined sources are 
expected to raise $87 million. The 
remaining $283 million must come 
from private donors. 

Last April a 48 page booklet was 
mailed to alumni informing them of 
the Campaign. Included was a state-
ment from President Brewster citing 
past and present academic glory, 
plus a description of Yale's current 
plight. The last pages give the 
"Basic Planning Concepts.'' 

"Year one (Spring 1974-8pring 
1975): Leadership Gifts and Organi-
zational Preparation-During this 
year ... approximately $200 million 
must be sought in gifts for both 
endowment and current use .... The 
Campaign did not expect to earn all 
$200 million the first year. Mr. 
Marshman estimates, "It takes ten 
months to two years for the big 
gifts. We have to go carefully, they 
like to take their time." However, 
the Campaign already has commit-
ments from the members of theY ale 
Corporation, as well as all the 
"friends of the family." 

Year One is up. The Campaign for 
Yale has $97 million. From Spring 
1974 to Spring 1975 it has earned 
only $13 million of this total. 

Mr. Miller looks tired. "The easy 
money is all in." 0
