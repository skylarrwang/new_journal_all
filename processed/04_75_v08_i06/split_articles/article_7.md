She assures me that she and her husband share 
the household tasks "absolutely," but she is wary 
that, in a few years, having a child may be the 
easy way out for her-"If I don't get the next pro-
motion. People I train with now would 
be moving ahead of me, but that doesn't bother 
me, as long as I'm doing something interesting." 
Although she and her husband, an investment 
banker, make nearly equal salaries, she feels a 
severe area of conflict would arise were she to 
make more. Her husband's career is "more impor-
tant, and that doesn't bother me." 

Stephanie, currently unemployed, lives a few 
miles from her parents' home in Brooklyn. She 
enjoys pottery and gourmet cooking, and dreams 
of a studio in southern France. "Someday I'll be-
come a famous potter." She and her husband, also 
a Yale graduate, hope to have children while they 
are young, and she hopes to return to school, al-
though she's not yet sure in what field. "I give 
myself six months to figure out my life," she said. 
Since graduation, she has worked her way up in a 
small pharmaceutical company from $130 a week 
typing to over $10,000 a year as right hand woman 
to the president, in charge of advertising, doing 
bibliographies, etc., all skills she learned on the 
job. "I just killed myself there ... l'd still do typing 
when it was needed; that was my problem, they 
relied on me too much for too many things. It was 
exhausting. I came home one night at 7:30, de-
cided I was about to have a nervous breakdown, 
told my boss I was quitting, then stayed a month 
and a half longer." She says that none of the em-
ployment agencies in her current job search recog-
nize that she has any skills, except typing. 

"When I made my first film, I was utterly ful-
filled, more than any other experience of my life. 
Since then, well, I've never really wanted to com-
mit suicide .... " Barbara could laugh, but her irony 
concealed the bitterness of three years of writing 
up budgets, submitting grant proposals, winning 
grants, meeting important producers who think 
highly of her work -and nothing but debts and an 
increasingly spotty if impressive resume to show 
for it. Now she works full time at a clerical-
computer job at a prestigious bank, where she was 
able to convince them-with the help of her Yale 
credentials-that she was serious about a banking 
career, after a "fling" with the arts. She edits her 
film at night and week-ends when she can wheedle 
equipment, and feels increasingly schizophrenic 
nine to five. 

• • • 
None of the men I talked with sounded 
"schizophrenic." None, when asked how they saw 
themselves in five years, mentioned fathering a 
single child. Like Karen the attorney, they defined 
themselves in terms of their work; unlike her, they 
did not see this as a problem. Most were trying for 
the same balance between work and personal life 
as were the women, but all seemed to be able to 
draw on a reservoir of seU-confidence, or at least 
the life-long expectation that they would support 
themselves. 

The relative lack of confidence of their female 
classmates, even those making $20,000 a year, led 
me to ask: did Yale make a difference? The partic-
ular strengths and quirks of the school itseU don't 
matter-and the peculiar situation of thoee first 
years of coeducation must be kept in mind. They 
were strange years, for everyone. What is impor-
tant is the differential impact of Yale on women 
aDd their future achievements, or lack of tbem.

Granting that, interviews indicate that the 
male vs. female experience at Yale was more sim-
ilar than different. Certainly the sex dichotomy is 
less applicable now, as women become fully inte-
grated into the university. Some students work, 
some don't, some students become more confident 
in four years, some less. But, academic life aside, 
no male students ever said to me, and I expect 
none will, "It was a big blur in my mind. I can't 
speak of those years." Men articulated specific 
experiences at Yale, positive or negative; women 
talked reluctantly about "lack of space to grow" 
or "confusing kalaidescopes," or refused to talk at 
all. One reflected, "At Yale I had no women 
friends. I felt disjointed. It was an identity prob-
lem I wasn't aware of- I was just one ofthe 
guys." This remark kept recurring as women dis-
cussed work, college, graduate school, and their 
intellectual lives. Even morestrikingthough, was 
that no one, except me, seemed bothered by the 
phrase, but proud of it. 

The women who did have a positive experi-
ence at Yale in those first confused years seem to 
have transferred from womens colleges, especially 
Vassar, Smith and Wellesley. There were 32 
women from Wellesley alone, out of 177 women in 
the class of '71. 

To the usual complaint about Wellesley's 
dorm dinner conversations on mixers and ward-
robes, one woman added, "Wellesley produced the 
perfect corporation president's wife. I wanted not 
to be the wife but the president." 

"I detested Vassar," another said. "Those 
were the two most miserable years of my life; 
while at Yale, I thought I really loved it. The dif-
ference between Vassar andY ale was not the 
quality of the courses but the quality of the bull-
shit; I'm sure Vassar was not as bad as I remem-
ber it." 

Yale, it seems clear, both encouraged and dis-
couraged women's career motivations. At Vassar, 
said a banker, "I saw the nice passive model, you 
know, from the class notes, Susie has her second 
child, her husband is in grad school. Yale changed 
my ideas of what I could do with my life. No one 
would ever ask a male graduate to sit down and 
type .... Yale gave me more of a backbone, made 
me more of a man, a leader." 

But another, who had just won a prestigious 
clerkship, complained, • 'Yale screwed me royally 
on career advice; there was none, or it was erro-
neous. All the guys I knew were doing better-I 
got demoralized." The anti-city, communal. "Con-
sciousness I II" atmosphere of the time, said a 
classmate, was partially responsible. Since the age 
of thirteen, she had wanted to attend law school, 
but Yale muted her interest. "Though I grew up in 
New York, I became anti-New York, anti-career. I 
was very confused. At Yale I saw men organizing 
projects, and said, 'why can't I do that?' I spent a 
lot of time flyina around, diaperaiua energy- I 
... unbappy aDd felt cbeated iD 
that way. But it's not udusively a female thiDg. 
Nobody did a damn~ 
except a few people who 
stood out. You did Me men makinc contacts you 
couldD•t make, a v.-y few meD .. but yoa dic:'D•t see

women making any. If women were compulsive 
workers, they did nothing splendid." Several men 
told me that they were offered jobs or fellowships 
through these contacts; none of the women did. 
"The old boy system works," said another class-
mate, "if you're not a girl." 

If many women were not inspired by academ-
ic work, or by professors, or by career possibilities, 
were they motivated by each other or by women's 
groups? (After the first year of anonymity and the 
10 to 1 ratio, there were scattered "consciousness 
raising" groups, a tiny organization called the 
Sisterhood, and an abortion law suit campaign.) 

Only a handful of women said they had been 
directly influenced by or had any contact with 
"the women's movement" such as it was. Most 
said, however, that they felt indirect influence 
through friends and reading. One former sociology 
major described herself as "sort of dikey. I was 
much heavier-we always wore jeans, never 
skirts, these issues were all we talked about." She 
did a senior year study of her classmates and their 
"self-actualization as a function of their social 
life." She found the most confident women had 
steady boyfriends; the least confident, those seek-
ing psychiatric help or having nervous break-
downs, led "normal social lives" -dating several 
men, a telling comment on the "normal social life" 
at the time, for both men and women. Speaking 
about the movement now, she said, "either I be-
carne disenchanted, or I took what I could get, and 
there's not that much more the women's move-
ment can offer me." 

A lawyer denied being affected by the move-
ment except that her mother no longer nagged her 
for not having two kids. A friend told me later 
that she had organized a women's tennis team and 
had been instrumental in the discrimination suit 
against the New York Yale Club. About the tennis 
team, she had said, "It was hard. I was annoyed 
we got so little support. In a way, it was good, 
because we really worked for what we wanted. But 
it shows the male Yale prejudice that women 
shouldn't be so competitive." 

The classmate who expressed the moat overt 
feminist beliefs, a photography professor and the 
first and only woman in her department, con-
cluded, "I think it will be uphill all the way. 
Women in academia (or the professions) won•t 
have it easy in our generation. But I'm gonna 
fight." She flew in from the midwest this past 
semester to teach a seminar in Calhoun Co1Jeae 
once a week. 

In short, I found both the women's move-
ment and Yale's influence on women's career 
choices minimal and indirect, with the one or two 
exceptions of those who said, "Y a1e ch.ansed my 
entire life." Yale's seeming lack of impact, ~or 
imagined, is either understandable or criminal, 
depending on your point of view. It comes riPt 
down to how seriously Yale eDCOUrageS leadenbip

seemed to make a difference in motivating women 
to pursue a career. Several said they were their 
"father's daughters"-"Everyone always said I'd 
go into business, like my father," -or brother's 
equals-"I grew up with the impression that there 
was nothing I couldn't do, I never considered not 
working." 

But sometimes even these strong incentives 
were confusing. The same woman who said her 
role-model was her professional mother, an ac-
countant, so that "Women's lib" wasn't necessary 
("I'm already what all women should become, 
someone who expects to work, to have a career") 
revealed later that unlike her boyfriend and former 
classmate, she didn't see her fulfillment in life 
coming from her work. "There's no work I could 
do that would make me forget lunch." She was 
especially jealous, however, of his high-paying, 
prestigious job in computer analysis, since, "We 
had identical educations .... ! helped him do his . 
computer homework." Now job-hunting, she says, 
('I don't think I'll ever produce as vital and as true 
and as smart an image as he can." But, " I 
wouldn't want his job, boss or company. I don't 
want to put up with what he puts up with." 

Like this woman, many classmates both were 
jealous of and spent a lot of time denigrating men 
they felt were over-absorbed in work. In fact, 
women talked less about how they themselves 
were working than how they saw their friends, 
lovers and classmates working. "This compulsive-
ness is disgusting beyond words," said a third 
year law student. A devoted jogger, she proudly 
showed me a T-shirt she had won in competition 
then went on to complain of the lawyer she knew 
who wouldn't talk on the phone to an old friend in 
town, let alone visit him, because he had too much 
work on a Sunday night. ·"Obviously I have no 
intention of having no personal life outside my 
work," she said "There's a lot of pressure in that 
direction, I'll have to confront it. I do worry a lot, 
yet I want these things. Status-it means a lot to 
me." 

A graduate student in history complained 
that all the men she knew, too, were in a frantic 
clutch about "success, reputation, name, being 
good. It is devastating." But what attracts her in 
men? That same intensity. 

After twenty-five interviews, this jarring 
ambivalence began to get to me. When asked how 
she saw herself in five years, for example, a third 
year law student said, "I could with equal 
probability be married with four kids, not prac-
ticing law, and so sublimely happy, or so into my 
work that I 'd not have time for men; more likely, 
I '11 be living with a supportive man, combining 
work and private life, with the major variable how 
much time he would give to his work." His work, 
again. 

Over and over, women insisted that the men 
who found their identity in work were immature 
and shallow. "They think they're hot shit; they 
aren't worth beans. Women are more flexible. Suc-
cess depends on emotional relationships. It may 
be a female characteristic. I can't stand brown-
nosing by men." But after criticizing the apple as 
TheNewJoumal/April25, 1976 
full of worms, they went on to say they wanted a 
bite, a big bite. This lawyer, for example, 
described the seductive game-playing by women 
wishing to get ahead in a firm with a fascinating 
mixture of bravado, fear, pride, and anger, careful 
to mention her own attractiveness, and ability at 
the game. She did not see herself as brown-nosing. 

Other women spoke of using their sexuality to get 
ahead, always attacking male chauvinism in the 
same breath. 

A completely opposite reaction came from a 
woman graduate student who kept secret the fact 
that she was living with a man because she would 
be "defamed" in her department as a "loose 
woman." Then she told me a story which made me 
understand her paranoia, and seemed to sum-
marize a lot more. She made me promise to change 
all the facts, so I wouldn't embarrass anyone, 
"since everyone in the grad school knows this 
story." 

A woman passed her comprehensive exams 
with distinction and was an outstanding 
member of her department. Then she didn't 
do well on a minor language exam, nothing 
crucial. Thirty-one, and "losing her looks," 
she felt she would have nothing if she failed at 
academia. She flew off to Argentina, married 
a man she had dated but hardly knew within 
two weeks, and had a baby within a year. 

Is it the "fear of success" in bright women, 
documented by Matina Homer, president of 
Radcliffe, or simply the fact that a woman's four 
or five best child-bearing years occur while she is 
in graduate school, or supposedly striving for her 
next promotion? One lawyer, whom other class-
mates describe as ambitious if not calculating, 
said of her desire for children: "I want them. If 
you fear death ... children leave links behind you. 
Without children, you're apt to be very lonely, 
dependent on your husband. A friend of my 
mother's is really quite miserable. It might be a 
bad thing to miss-you're better off with them 
than not." She has not found very many men she 
wants to date, let alone marry. 

I don't want to give the wrong idea. The other 
side of ambivalence is balance, however shaky. Of 
course, feminists and calculating career women 
can have children and do. Many of the women I 
talked with seemed to be achieving a compromise 
rather than dwelling on dualities. Or were they? 

A graduate student said, "I'm seeking the 
great wholeness-relationships you care about, a 
profession you love-so you don't get obsessed 
with the relationship, and don't get fanatic about 
work-it's a delicate balance, a little skewed in my 
case." She added that she neither performed as 
well in the clutch nor took her work "with ultimate 
seriousness" as did her male colleagues. "They, 
especially my professors, see my desire to teach at 
a community college with my Ph.D. as a 
cop-out-I see it as a potential means of balancing 
what I want out of life." 

Is it balance or cop-out? A lawyer making 
$20,500 tells me, dark circles under her eyes, "I 
very much like what I'm doing. My husband is so 
nice. If I weren'tmarried, I'd be miserable-dating 
all the time-it's so distracting." She says the job 
has taken its toll; she's not sure she would be 
working if it weren't for her husband's debts. "I'm 
obsessed with competition at this point; women 
leave because they no longer desire to compete. I 
don't care if I don't become a partner-it's a rat 
race-I work almost every weekend. I've decided 
to stop, even though I have an overdue memo for a 
partner." Is she copping out, or being sane, so she 
can get some sleep?

TIN NewJoumtJll April26,1975 
Janet, a graduate student, said, "I have the 
same ideal of satisfaction with a man and my 
work. It's a terrible conflict-there's only so much 
time. I find myself acting like a man, relegating 
my boyfriend to second place. I'm brittle and 
grouchy if it's just my work alone ... On the other 
hand, I haven't done as well this year, maybe I 
didn't get something finished because I was 
cooking a meal." This dialogue followed: 
J: • • Academics will never be my whole life, 
fanatical as you may think I am." 
P, her friend: "What I meant by your 
fanatical devotion to your work was your 
brilliance in scholarship. Everyone admires it." 
J: "Who me?" 

Is this balance, or lack of confidence? 

Indeed, some of the women who were the 
most "ambivalent" and whose statements were 
the most contradictory expressed the most 
interest in money, prestige, success, and power. "1. 
have vast aspirations," said the same laWYer who 
saw herself as possibly barefoot, pregnant and 
blissful. "Either I'll conquer the world, or find ful-
fillment without status and external consider-
ations. I'm interested in politics, the men I'm 
attracted to are powerful politically, I'm attracted 
to power. It sounds inhuman, I don't like what it 
says about me as a person." 

She also feels she threatens men, which other 
classmates reiterated. "They're afraid in the 
crunch I won't play mommy, and I'm afraid I 
will-that's why I come on so aggressive and 
independent." But she feels no guilt about making 
money, or "making more than my husband. In 
theory it wouldn't be a problem, in fact it would, 
unless we're both making over 100." $100,000 a 
year, that is. 

She then observed that men she knew who 
were doing spectacular work were only now 
"toying with the possibility that a woman might 
make a difference. Basically my male friends have 
never been in love, now they're feeling a sense of 
loss, and coming to the realization that they'd like 
to compromise." 

Perhaps both men and women can achieve a 
compromise, coming from different sides of the 
sexual gap, or chasm. But women need to not only 
work out the nitty-gritty details of childcare and 
part-time work in juggling career and personal 
life, and to find men who are not threatened. They

also need role-models, and they aren't finding any. 
"I wish there were someone fifty years old I 
could look up to," said one banker. "I was terri-
fied when I came here (the branch where she heads 
the credit department): it's been really gratifying, 
they've had a lot of bitchy women, one who 
screwed her way to the top, another who was 
eccentric, incompetent, flighty; I like to think I've 
shown them I'm competent, feminine, not 
threatening, one of the guys, but a lady too, and I 
get the work done damn well." 

Besides role-models, she-and others-kept 
telling me they needed house-husbands. "There 
sure are enough men around who don't want to 
work." I didn't find any candidates among the 
men I asked. "I enjoy my work," she concluded. "I 
do as much as I have to do to get a good job done. 
I'm not married to it." 

In all my interviews, I found only two women 
who were "married to their work" and who did not 
find that questions about ambivalence and 
balance struck a raw nerve. They were both single, 
slightly overweight, and had a sense of irony 
about themselves. There the resemblance ended. 

Peggy, a banker, drank glass after glass of 
club soda with lime until I lost count and we were 
the last people in the Yale Club. She wheedled free 
cake and a carafe of wine effortlessly from the 
waiter, insisting over and over how much she 
loves her work. "I don't find anyone else who 
does, I feel very self-conscious, like the dynamic 
business lady, par excellence, the weirdo in the 
group. I am competitive by nature, I want to 
succeed, and be recognized as the best in my 
field." Every once in a while, however, she con-
fessed, she'll get up late, "have lunch at the Plaza, 
go to a matinee, meet a friend for tea, isn't this 
lovely, a suburban lady you know, I've nothing 
against it if it's conscious choice, and then I 
realize, it's nice for one day, not for five. I live out 
my fantasies to get rid of them." 

She described a possible marriage between 
two travelling bankers; "If he works in D.C., me in 
New York, we'll meet in Philly." She said that the 
secretaries in her office were appalled at her joke 
about preferring goldfish as pets to children, and 
told how, after a fiasco weekend interview her 
senior year at a southern Law School, the only 
"girl" applying for a prestigious fellowship, she 
sent copies of Sisterhood is Powerful by Robin 
Morgan, inscribed to all the faculty wives. She 
didn't get the fellowship. 

"I'm a very junior person, I haven't yet 
reached my prime; when I'm forty, I'll be 
formidable in the best sense." She is formidable, 
ushering me out of the Yale Club. "All my friends 
and I , we're frightfully traditional Old Blues, with 
all the characteristics that go with it, almost 
ethnic characteristics, bankers, analysts, laWYers, 
and doctors, conventional. 'Oh my goodness, it's 
happened to me,' we say." 

Nancy and I talked in her bright red 
Victorian house filled with paintings by one of her 
roommates-large, colorful nudes, crouching, 
standing, staring. She works with a radical group 
organizing in New Haven, does economic research 
for two professors part-time to support herself, 
and writes. "I write because I want to leave some-
thing behind me- and I probably won't have 
children.'' After graduation she did part-time 
clerical work and edited a local radical newspaper 
for a year and a half, then went to the London 
School of Economics for a masters degree in 
economic history. 

In the last three and a half years, she said her 
attitude toward work has "changed passively." 
While doing clerical work, "I knew it wasn't a 
terrific job but I never sought anything else. 
page9 
Politics was the thing I was doing, where most of 
my energy went." After her stay in England, she 
decided she wanted to get paid doing work that 
would give her energy rather than take it away. 

Her room on the porch has bay windows on 
three sides; she turned frequently in her desk 
chair and looked out over the tops of the trees. "I 
see my life as not without conflict but if I hold to a 
steady course-my own-not a ready made 
cubby-hole-my work and my political life will 
continue to be interwoven." As an example of this 
she said she anticipates a union organizing drive 
at Yale in the next year. She is learning secretarial 
skills at night school so she can get involved by 
taking a typist position. In five years she is not at 
all sure what she will be doing but hopes to 
continue "acquiring skills. I want jobs that will 
teach me things-I'm interested in labor, 
economics, history." Her only security, she said, 
is her ability to work. 

"I see myself as a single person the rest of my 
life." She looked directly at me again and said she 
wants enough money so she can buy property, a 
house, as security when "I'm old and sick and 
crazy." She laughed. "I've definitely changed." 

Marriage, she feels, is an appealing option for a 
woman because it has traditionally provided that 
security. 

While we talked a man she had introduced 
earlier as a friend from Holland came in, took a 
shirt from the closet and left with a book. 

Blushing and laughing excitedly, she described 
their relationship. "Our roles are completely 
reversed. It's almost too funny. I don't just mean 
tasks. He's supposed to be here working, but-" 
she laughed again, then became serious. "I'm the 
one who needs emotional support and he doesn't 
mind being the person giving it, intellectually he's 
in my orbit rather than me in his. It feels so 
natural; this must be right for me. But sometimes 
it comes over me, 'I'm getting away with some-
thing. This isn't how it should be.' But I'm really 
happy it is." 

For a while we talked about writers we 
liked-Proust, Doris Lessing, Simone de 
Beauvoir-and joked about taking down the 
names and addresses of our rich classmates. By 
now I had thrown away my questions about power 
and success, but I still wanted to know-how is 
she certain when she's on "her own course?" 

"When I'm not going a little crazy," she said. "I 
had a sense of peace in England-a balance- I 
haven't been able to establish it here yet. It 
requires intense self-knowledge. The peril for me is 
going crazy. I think that's peculiar to being 
female, Marxist, and alive in the U.S. today." 

She said this, I nodded and wrote it all down, 
but I was struck by how calm and sane she 
seemed, looking over her desk and the trees 
toward the Long Island Sound. 

Having spoken for my classmates (I've 
always thought Joyce Maynard presumptuous), I 
would like nothing better than to be disproved. I 
want scores of young women, from Yale or any-
where, to write me saying: "I love my work, I'm 
devoted to my career, art, profession, I won't give 
it up, I'll never have kids, I want power, fame, 
$100 thou, to be one of the guys, a man .... " 

No- I'd rather see women, and men, write in 
describing that delicate balance, doing work one 
cares about, having relationships one cares about, 
without neurosis or guilt or agonizing self-
indulgence; defining "success" not in terms of 
money and status but in terms of inner satisfac-
tion and even joy; using "power" humanely to 
better the lives of others. A utopian, unrealizable 
fantasy? So was "coeducation" in 1971.0
