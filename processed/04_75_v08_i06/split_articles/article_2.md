Edmund Morgan does not like to 
think of himself as a prophet. He is a 
professor of colonial history at Yale 
University. He says that he does not 
hear voices. He admits that his pre-
dictions are often wrong. Yet he does 
hold one belief about the future with 
a great deal of certainty. His study 
of human behavior in the past and in 
the present has convinced him that 
the world has paused on the brink of 
its own annihilation. 

Morgan bases his conviction upon 
a simple assumption about the way 
in which people behave toward one 
another. "Human beings," he says, 
"given the opportunity to do some-
thing horrible, will sooner or later do 
it." 

In a world of multi-megatons and 
multiple warheads, the implication is 
obvious enough. "It is now within 
their capacity to produce the utmost 
horror, which is to say the destruc-
tion of the world.'' The knowledge 
that such a capacity exists is only a 
small deterrent. "The balance of 
terror can prolong things," Morgan 
says. "But I don't think it can keep a 
hold on them forever. Human beings 
have behaved despicably often 
enough that you expect them to do it 
sooner or later." It is difficult not to 
interpret such statements prophet-
ically. 

Morgan sees no way of predicting 
when exactly the apocalyptic mo-
ment will arrive. Yet he admits to a 
sense of its perpetual imminence. "I 
thought it would probably happen 
before this," he says. "I decided 
about 1946 it would be only a matter 
of time, probably ten or twenty 
years." He finds no reason for opti-
mism in the inaccuracy of his first 
estimate. He believes that any num-
ber of the current world problems 
could mark the end's beginning. 

A man of inherent modesty, Mor-
gan is surprised, even embarrassed 
that anyone would seek out his belief 
on the issue. He stresses that he 
speaks with no particular expertise. 
He does not consider his view espe-
cially novel. Historically it is any-
thing but unique. "It has only been a 
short time," he points out, "that peo-
ple have thought otherwise.'' 

Morgan is far from the first Yale 
academic to believe in the certainty 
of Armageddon. This university has 
bestowed one of its (presumably) 
highest honors on three such men, 
two of whom were also past presi-
dents: Jonathan Edwards, Timothy 
Dwight, and Ezra Stiles. Yet their 
understanding of how history would 
end bears little resemblance to Mor-
gan's. 

As ordained Protestant ministers, 
they placed their faith in super-
natural redemptive power. The end 
they predicted was a happy prelude 
to the Kingdom of Heaven. Instead 
of nuclear ashes they foresaw a mil-
lenial age, a thousand-year period in 
which Christian saints would rule the 
earth in holy love before ascending 
into glory. 

Such an escatology remains of 
purely historical interest to Morgan, 
who has written a biography of 
Stiles. "My own religious beliefs 
aren't very clear," he says. He ex-
pects instead an apocalypse of whol-
ly human creation. Spontaneous 
effusions of the spirit-Christian or 
otherwise-will never redeem the 
world, as some more optimistic souls 
continue to hope to this day. "I 
guess I don't have much faith in 
that sort of thing," Morgan admits. 

Still, in a fundamental respect, 
Morgan's vision is related to that of 
the colonial Americans whom he 
studies. Men such as Dwight, Stiles, 
and Edwards had little confidence in 
the human capacity for good-quite 
the opposite-they believed in hu-
man depravity, in the power of orig-
inal sin. They took their conception 
of man from the sixteenth-century 
church reformer John Calvin. 

Calvin, a French lawyer turned 
theologian, asserted that men were 
essentially corrupt, selfish, and dan-
gerous beings, "the inmost recesses 
of whose hearts are full of pravity, 
whose eyes are insidiously employed, 
whose minds are elated with inso-
lence-in a word, all whose powers 
are prepared for the commission of 
atrocious and innumerable crimes." 

Morgan has reached a similar con-
clusion based upon a lifetime of hard 
observation. "I think that the Cal-
vinistic view of human nature is a 
realistic one," he says, "that prob-
ably people are all corrupt." 

Is this the message which history 
teaches? "I don't think history 
teaches any message about human 
nature," Morgan says. ''There are 
certainly plenty of examples of hu-
man beings behaving decently-I 
suppose that's the only basis on 
which you can say they're corrupt-
but to expect people to do so all the 
time is something else." 

The extent of their indecency is 
potentially overwhelming. "If you 
could keep before your mind, before 
your consciousness all the time, all 
the things that are happening to 
people all over the world, I think it 
would really drive you out of your 
mind." 

Of course, few individuals, in spite 
of their own depravity, would admit 
that they favored committing the 
largest of possible crimes against 
humanity. "I suppose that if you had 
to take a vote on whether to do some-
thing horrible," Morgan says, "the 
majority would probably vote a-
gainst it." But in this he finds little 
reassurance. "It doesn't take very 
many people to do it now. Sooner or 
later someone, some nut, someone 
who is slightly warped one way or 
the other, will have the power." 

Thus, barring the prospect of di-
vine intervention, the ultimate con-
sequence of depravity must be self-
destruction. Should John Calvin 
suddenly appear through a time 
warp, it seems unlikely he would 
deny the logic. 

And what of the meantime? How 
should we respond to such a pros-
pect? "I guess my answer would be 
that the most one could do is what-
ever things one believes in, regard-
less of what the fate of the world 
might be." 

For Morgan this means doing simÂ· 
ply what he enjoys, namely trying to 
understand the world as it is. He is 
fascinated by human behavior. He 
finds a tremendous satisfaction in 
scholarship. As Calvin insisted, 
man's natural commitment is to him-
self. "Maintain whatever dignity you 
can," Morgan advises. "It's not 
within your power to transform the 
world." 

He professes no desire to escape 
the inevitable should it arrive in his 
own lifetime. "If they're going to 
bomb someplace I would prefer to be 
in the middle of it," he says. "I'd 
rather not be a survivor."
