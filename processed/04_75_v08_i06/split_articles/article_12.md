Restoring the balance 
Once, during every freshman assem-
bly, Kingman Brewster mentions 
something about Yale being a place 
for "intellectual growth and develop-
ment," a place where "every time 
you think you have an answer," 
you're shown to be wrong. That, 
along with a glance at the "guide-
lines" at the front of the course of 
study booklet constitutes the full 
extent of our indoctrination to four 
years of the liberal arts. One whole 
class of seniors prepares to graduate 
this spring without ever having been 
exposed to a formal definition of the 
purposes of a Yale education. 


In fact, all around us are signs 
that without any such "formal" 
definition, and without any desire to 
figure one out for themselves, an 
alarming number of students~ -~·. 
simply missing the point of a Yale · 
education. Behind all the surface dis-
orders-over-crowded libraries and 
the growing concern for higher 
grades-lies the sad fact that too 
many students have forgotten what 
they are doing at a liberal arts uni-
versity. 


The dangers of this "forgetful-
ness" were first seen three years ago 
by a select "Study Group on Yale 
College." In its controversial and far-
ranging "Dahl Report" - published 
early in the fall of 1972-the com· 
mit tee recognized that the faculty's 
participation in Yale College 
involves a number of necessary but 
rather delicate "tensions." 


It recognized that the central ten-
sion defining Yale College arises 
when top-rate scholars, professionals 
whose interest lie outside the univer· 
sity, are asked to teach undergradu-
ates. Without this tension, the col-
lege would not exist. And most 
importantly, many of the Dahl 
Report recommendations arose out 
of the conviction that in order for 
this balance to be maintained, the 
faculty must constantly be reminded 
as to what it is doing at Yale. 


The report didn't get very far. The 
faculty refused to accept it as a defin-
ition of the future goals of Yale edu · 
cation, and it now sits idly collect· 
ing dust on the bookshelves of SSS. 
But if, as Yale College Dean Hor-
ace Taft suggests, the committee's 
insights were "ahead of their time" 
in 1972, they are proving more and 
more timely this spring. If not in its 
specific recommendations, the spirit 
of this repo1t speaks directly to Psy· 
chology Professor William Kessen's 
recent observation that the college is 
no longer a "place to be" but a 
"place to go on from." It explains 
William Sloane Coffin's Easter Sun· 
day blast against the "pygmy world" 
law boards and chemistry tests. And 
it confirms our own foreboding sense 
that even the eight-course credit/ 
fail option will not ease the compe-
tition in Biology 11. 


By implication alone, the Dahl 
Report suggests that as students, we 
have forgotten that our own partici-
pation in the college involves many 
of the same "tensions" that the com-
mittee pointed out in the faculty's 
involvement with Yale. 


Yale has always asked its students 
to strike a balance between distribu-
tion and concentration in their pro-
gram of study, between asserting 
their own creativity and being recep-
tive to new ideas. But today, the cen-
tral "tension" in the student's 
involvement with Yale College lies 
between his own ever-growing inclin-
ations towards professionalism, and 
the almost anti-professional attitude 
demanded by a liberal arts educa-
tion. 


It exists as a tension because 
neither extreme makes the best use 
of the resources which Yale provides. 
While one extreme looks past the 
university, turning it into a mere 
stepping-stone to careers in law and 
medicine, the other asks the student 
to more-or-less suspend his profes-
sional interests for four years and 
dabble without any pressure of com-
mitment in a number of different 
areas. Instead, it is the balance 
between some sense of professional 
direction on the one hand, and a wil-
lingness to experiment on the other 
that best suits Yale's unique aca-
demic resources. 


All around us, however, are signs 
that this balance has been upset, 
indications that the problems Yale 
now faces lie not within the structure 
of its resources but with the attitude 
with which students are approaching 
those resources. This sense that the 
"essential tensions" no longer sus-
tain a liberal arts attitude in the col-
lege has led many of the more percep-
tive administrators to a growing con-
cern that Yale education is reaching 
a "crisis point." Out of this sense of 
imbalance, for example, Kessen pub-
lished an article in the Yale Daily 
News last December on "Murdering 
the present." 


Deploring what he termed the 
growing "ideology of promotion" at 
Yale, Kessen pointed out what in 
fact happens when students forget 
that they are at a liberal arts univer· 
sity rather than, say, a six-year pre-
medical program. "At Yale today," 
wrote Kessen, " the promotional prin-
ciple flourishes. Our libraries, facul-
ties, stones are becoming part of a 
waystation, a marvelously decorated 
and frantically active waiting room." 


The real tragedy lies not simply 
in the overcrowding of the Cross 
Campus library, but in the fact that 
the push for grades and the eye 
towards graduate schools is under-
mining the spirit of the liberal arts 
education that Yale is best set up to 
accomodate. 


And the answer lies not in any 
"formal" definition of the purposP. of 
a Yale education, not in another Dahl 
Report to be rejected and forgotten. 
It can be reached only through a con-
tinuing and searching discourse 
among students and faculty as to 
just what their involvement in Yale 
education is all about. 


Ever since the faculty rejected the 
Dahl Report in 1972, this spirit of 
self-reflection, of a dialogue in which 
one's own experience receives con-
stant assessment among friends and 
professors, has been missing most at 
Yale. Without it, there can be no 
hope of preserving the true spirit of 
a liberal arts education against the 
"promotional" tendencies of the 
times. Only a renewed concern with 
our own involvement in Yale can 
restore the tensions that in many 
ways provide the life and vitality of 
the college experience. No faculty 
committee can design it. It must 
come from the hearts of those stu-
dents who are just now awakening to 
the uniqueness of what Yale Univer· 
sity has to offer. 0
