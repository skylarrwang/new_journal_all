AFORE NIGHT COME 
by David Rudkin 
"It has been wonderfully well done ... 
It is terrifyingly brilliant and so well 
acted by the Long W harf cast -and 
so well costumed, set and lit - that it 
m akes an experience of truly awful 
power." 
Clive Barnes, The New York Times

A.udio Den Says ••• 
You can bu~ a little AM/FM 
clock radio for thirty bucks. 
So why spend $149.95? 
ObviOUsly so yov con v.10ke up to hiQh fidelity rather thon someth1ng thot sounds 
like 11 s cormng through o paper cup on o string. The KLH Model Twenty.One CL IS 
o senous high fidelity radio for seriOUs music listeners who also wont to know what 
t1me it 1s.lt hos on 1ncredibly accurate d.gitol clock w1th oil the necessary alarm and 
v.10ke-up features. But most important, 11 hos o truly uncanny sound. A powerful 
sound with highs that s1ng and low-s you con actually feel. The FM sectton pulls 1n 
sto11011s yov didn't even know were on the dial. And the AM makes even traffic 
reports. time checks, "pop forties" and "moldy oldies'' sound good 
In short, 1t's o neat, compact AM/FM clock rod1o that v.10kes yov up, keeps ternftc 
time, and delivers on astonishing amount of sound. 
Now yov might th1nk it tokes o lot of nerve to chorge $149.95 for 
o little clock rodio. 
Not-reo fly. 
Whot 1t tokes 1s o lot of clock rod10. 
The KLH Twenty.One CL is at your KLH dealer now. 
See 11 soon. (Also ovolloble without digital clock 1n 
_....jjjjiiiiiP::fl 
AM/FM or FM only models.)
