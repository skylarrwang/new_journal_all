New Haven Country Dancers share snacks and 
conversation after the first hour and a half of do-si-
do-ing, and some gather at a diner after the dance. 
According to Gaffney, many contra groups have 
a similar format. “If you go somewhere where 
there’s a contra dance, you’re going to be able to 
walk in and feel at home,” he said. 

The contra community is tight-knit. It’s also 
mostly white. Some contra dancers say the 
welcoming vibes don’t extend to people of 
color. One Facebook post asked, “Why is contra 
dancing predominately [sic] Caucasian?” Over 
four hundred commenters interrogated the lack 
of diversity, suggested responses, gave examples 
of microaggressions, and contested the examples. 
One dancer from a North Carolina group said 
their group was “very diverse.” A second dancer 
from the same group called it “very white.” A 
third dancer offered, “As an actual, real-life contra 
dancer of color… I can tell you all that walking 
into a space that’s noticeably, overwhelmingly 
white can feel unwelcoming and off-putting.” 

McGuinness wants the New Haven group to 
be more diverse, but she is nervous about making 
people of color feel uncomfortable or singled 
out for their race. “It’s something I’ve struggled 
with,” she said. “My understanding is that because 
[contra] tends to be quite white, a person of color 
comes, feels out of place, and doesn’t come back.” 

Lindsay, on the other hand, doesn’t think dancers 
should feel accountable for contra’s homogeneity. 
“Civil rights is way beyond the scope of trying 
to create an Anglo-American-based folk dance 
tradition in a community that’s a melting pot,” 
he said. Lindsay described contra dancers as both 
“community-oriented” and “a little bit tribal,” and 
seemed to ignore the conflicting connotation. 

Contra’s Facebook commenters continue debating 
what level of racial diversity should be expected 
of a tradition that has historically been connected 
with white European culture. 

From the mid-nineties until late 2016, the 
New Haven Country Dancers didn’t actually 
meet in New Haven, and instead danced at a 
community center in the predominantly white 
suburb of Branford, where they moved after 
several members’ cars were broken into. Now the 
group rents the Friends Meetinghouse on a tree-
lined street in New Haven’s Fair Haven Heights 
neighborhood. Bordered by the Quinnipiac River, 
the meetinghouse seems separate from the rest 
of New Haven. But onto the dance floor come 
questions that resonate throughout and beyond 
the Elm City, questions about how communities 
are constructed, and to what extent they require 
change.
