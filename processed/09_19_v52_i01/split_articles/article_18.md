O
ne summer afternoon in 2012, in 
Wethersfield, Connecticut, a police 
dispatcher named Sharon Imbert had 
just finished cleaning her brother-in-law John 
Fritz’s kitchen when she discovered a receipt 
for a $2,000 money order tucked into a basket 
of apples. A gift from Sharon, the “snack basket” 
doubled as an in-house mail drop: whenever 
John, who has cerebral palsy, received paperwork 
he could not understand, he left it there for 
Sharon to find. “What’s this?” Sharon asked 
John, holding up the pink slip. “Oh,” he replied. 
“Michael told me I had too much money.” 
Sharon pressed for details, more confused 
than alarmed. For thirty years, an estates lawyer 
named Michael Schless had managed John’s 
finances as his court-appointed conservator. John 
told Sharon that Schless had called him on the 
phone the previous week. Apparently, Schless 
had instructed John to mail him a money order 
in the amount of $2,000; John’s savings account, 
he said, was “too full.” Schless wanted to transfer 
the excess funds into John’s checking account at 
TD Bank.
Along 
with 
cerebral 
palsy, 
John 
has 
co-occurring physical and intellectual disabilities 
that limit his ability to live independently. 
When his mother died, he moved from her 
home to a subsidized apartment, and the 
Imberts assembled a team of home health aides 
to help him with chores and personal hygiene. 
An eternal optimist, John is “the type of person 
that wears rose-colored glasses,” Sharon said. In 
reality, he wears boxy, wire-rimmed glasses that 
slightly enlarge his eyes; the sixty-nine-year-old’s 
feathery brown hair shows only a few streaks of 
gray. He loves to swim, and spends the better 
part of each year looking forward to his two-week 
stint at Camp Harkness, a summer camp for 
adults with disabilities, by a lake in Waterford. 
Under water, where gravity’s pull is weaker than 
on land, he can move his limbs freely, and they 
obey his commands.
By the summer of 2012, John’s inheritance, 
once worth $270,000, including a mortgage and 
interest-bearing accounts, had inexplicably run 
dry. Before his mother died, she had carefully 
secured a trust fund for him “so that John would 
never have to worry,” Sharon said. But then, 
several months before the pink slip appeared in 
the snack basket, Schless cancelled John’s home 
health aides for lack of funds. Sharon and her 
husband, Jim—a burly man with a buzz cut and 
the calm that comes from decades in federal law 
enforcement—started visiting John’s subsidized 
apartment daily to cook and clean. Almost 
overnight, it seemed, John went broke, and no 
one could explain how. 
The Imberts, with John’s approval, filed a 
request for a change of conservator in December 
2012. Jim replaced Schless, gaining access to his 
brother’s bank records. Over the next year, the 
Imberts spent their limited free time piecing 
together the paper trail that Schless had left in 
his wake. Each weekend, Sharon, who has close-
set blue eyes, a sturdy build, and a firm handle 
on common sense, rose early. She hauled out 
a cardboard box full of files and settled into a 
chair at her built-in kitchen desk. 
“Every day I worked on this, there was a 
discovery,” Sharon told me, perched beside Jim 
on the stoop of their modest summer home in 
Niantic, Connecticut. “And every day, it got 
more horrible.”

Conservatorship is a legal arrangement designed 
to protect the country’s most vulnerable adults. 
Hailed as an alternative to institutionalization 
and even as a means of preventing homelessness, 
conservatorship transfers the authority of a disabled 
person to a trusted family member or attorney. The 
legal ground for establishing this relationship is a 
finding of “incapacity”: when a judge deems an 
adult incapable of managing their own affairs, for 
reasons of disability, age, or mental illness, the 
state may appoint a conservator to take over. 
Nationwide, court-appointed conservators and 
guardians—the terminology differs by state—help 
manage 1.3 million lives and at least $50 billion 
in assets. In Connecticut, conservatorship is 
housed in probate, a system of specialized courts 
descended from the Orphans’ Courts of the 
American colonies that handle a wide variety of 
cases involving children, seniors, and adults with 
mental illness or intellectual disabilities. From 
colonial times, Connecticut’s probate courts 
inherited a scattered system—before a recent 
restructuring, there were 123 of them—and the 
power to act as a benevolent parent to those in need 
of protection or care. Paul Knierim, Connecticut’s 
former probate administrator who left the post 
in late August, described the responsibilities of 
conservators as “truly awesome.” “We are asking 
them to take on the well-being of an individual 
who, by definition, is unable to manage his or her 
own finances and personal care,” he said. “That 
is so big a set of duties that no person can take it 
lightly.”
Yet Connecticut’s system and similar ones across 
the U.S., from Nevada to Florida, have proved 
ripe for exploitation. In Connecticut, as in many 
other states, there are no statutory requirements 
for becoming a conservator. The state’s probate 
courts do not conduct background checks, except 
on conservators serving indigent people, meaning 
anyone on public assistance or whose income is 
125 percent or less of the federal poverty level. 
Even for those cases, the vetting is cursory. Probate 
administrators check disciplinary histories, but “as 
long as they have a law license,” Knierim said, 
attorneys can sign up for as many conservatorships 
as they want, provided the local probate judge 
approves the caseload—and the growing demand 
for conservators incentivizes judges to do so. In 
theory, once approved, an exploitative conservator 
could move between districts unnoticed: there is 
no statewide record of conservators who have been 
removed from their conservatorships because of 
misconduct or malpractice.
According 
to 
the 
National 
Council 
on 
Disability, conservatorship “is often viewed as an 
issue impacting older Americans and not thought 
of as an important disability issue,” even though 
in at least eleven states, the legal procedure to 
impose a conservatorship on developmentally 
disabled adults is less rigorous than the equivalent 
procedure for the elderly. Some of those adults, 
like John, spend more than half of their lifetimes 
under conservatorship. When conservators abuse 
their power, the betrayal can be psychologically 
devastating 
and 
financially 
disastrous. 
Less 
calculably, the abuse of conservatorship erodes 
residents’ faith in the legal system. Last spring, 
after a Bristol attorney working as a conservator 
admitted to stealing more than $100,000 from her 
clients, presiding judge Vanessa Bryant called the 
public’s trust in the state “a silent victim.”        
A few weeks after Jim took over as John’s 
conservator, in 2012, the Imberts received a 
handwritten note from Schless, along with two 
bank checks and a Social Security statement. 
According to an affidavit, the checks, which 
constituted all of the money left in John’s name, 
totaled $10,473.87—just under four percent of the 
roughly $200,000 that Sharon calculated should 
have remained. 
Over the next few days, Sharon and Jim, police 
dispatcher and former federal agent, pursued 
leads. Jim requested copies of checks from the 
three banks where Schless had opened accounts 
for John. But he withdrew his request when he 
discovered that each copy would cost $1.50. The 
irony was not lost on him: John could no longer 
afford the records that would show where his 
money had gone. 
Sharon had better luck. At Wethersfield 
Housing Authority, the public housing agency that 
managed John’s subsidized apartment, she found 
ten years’ worth of records, including more than 
one thousand copies of checks. Back at her kitchen 
desk, Sharon leafed through the files. 
Auto insurance. That didn’t make sense: John 
couldn’t drive because of his physical disabilities. 
“Almost overnight, it 
seemed, John went 
broke, and no one 
could explain how.”
