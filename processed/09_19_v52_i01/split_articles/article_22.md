EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
With less than an hour to go 
before New Haven’s branch of the 
Japanese-owned Shiru Cafe closed 
for the last time, the place was almost empty. It 
was a balmy Friday afternoon just before the end 
of August, but inside, the AC was pumping cold 
air into the cafe’s cavernous interior. A cluster 
of baristas and a manager huddled at the back of 
the café, leaving the register unattended, while 
a handful of stray students dotted some of the 
cafe’s many tables and chairs. No one went up to 
order a drink. Only half an hour remained until 
the cafe would shutter its doors, fewer than four 
months after it opened on College Street. It was 
a swift and ignominious defeat for a coffee shop 
that branded itself on social media as “one of 
the most innovative cafes on the planet.”


The divine inspiration for Shiru’s business 
model hit its founder, Yuliy Kakimoto, while he 
was on a snowboarding trip years ago, according 
to the cafe’s website. By some bizarre alchemy, a 
car ride through a “long tunnel” during that trip 
inspired Kakimoto to conceive of a coffee shop 
that, instead of making a profit by selling coffee, 
would gather data from students and sell it to 
companies looking to recruit them. (As of the 
cafe’s closing date, the “sponsors” page on Shiru 
New Haven’s mobile app listed no companies.)


I had known about Shiru—which sparked 
controversy in the United States with its policy 
barring entry to anyone without a university ID—
since early May, when it opened its third U.S. 
location, in New Haven. Spurred by Facebook 
ads promising free coffee for “#collegestudents,” 
I had logged onto Shiru’s website to see exactly 
what the fuss was all about. 


Immediately after loading the homepage, I was 
waylaid by the “Shiru Cafe Bot,” who politely 
invited me to start a conversation in a simulated 
text chat box. But before I could ask any 
questions, the bot demanded to know whether 
I was a “student!”, “employer!”, “university 
professional!”, or “none of the above!” After I 
replied, my ebullient interlocutor sent me to 
the app store to download the Shiru Cafe app. 
I pressed on.


The app required me to set up an account 
with my Yale email and student ID number, 
and subsequently inquired about my area of 
study, employment history, and IT skills. I 
had a sneaking suspicion that my answers—
“Humanities,” “lifeguard,” and “None of 
them”—would disappoint. I prayed that the 
Shiru Cafe Bot wouldn’t find out.


Finally, the app asked me to select my desired 
industry from a drop-down menu of one hundred-
plus options, which ranged from the predictable 
(“Private Equity,” “Management Consulting”) 
to the quaint (“Dairy,” “Furniture”) to the 
creepily vague (“Outsourcing/Offspring”) to 
the downright insidious (“Plastic,” “Tobacco”). 
I selected “Newspapers,” and my account was 
complete. 


I didn’t make it to Shiru before classes ended 
last spring, but the cafe popped up on my social 
media feeds all summer. In May, two prominent 
members of the New Haven community—
New Haven Independent reporter Tom Breen 
and immigrant rights activist John Lugo—
approached the cafe on separate occasions and 
filmed tense exchanges with its manager, Barbara 
Jeanna Lafond (who declined to comment for 
this story), in which they questioned whether 
Shiru’s business model would exacerbate the 
city’s town-gown inequality. 


During the exchange with Breen, Lafond 
defended Shiru’s exclusionary policy: “We’re 
trying to change the normal way of doing 
things, so that students don’t have to go through 
what was uncomfortable in the past,” she said. 
(Ah, finally, a solution to the crippling anxiety I 
feel every time I walk into Blue State and brush 
elbows with a townie.) Soon after, Havenly 
Treats, a Yale-founded collaborative that trains 
refugee chefs in New Haven, ended its contract 
with Shiru and issued a public rebuke. 


“I refuse to give a penny to them, and everyone 
in the community who cares about justice 
and inclusion should do the same,” read one 
Facebook review from a Yale graduate student. 
Another review simply read: “Racism, classism, 
elitism. Nah.”


In mid-June—a month-and-a-half after the 
initial controversy over the cafe’s opening—
Shiru announced in a cryptic press release titled 
“Shiru Café USA New Business Model Expands 
Community Reach” that it was opening up its 
American locations to the wider public. 


But even after Shiru’s gesture toward 
inclusivity, something about the core of its 
business model—collecting data from cash-
strapped, caffeine-dependent college students 
in order to help corporate recruiters—still felt 
wrong. 


I returned to Shiru’s website looking for 
answers and, ignoring persistent “hey there!” 
messages from my old friend, the Shiru Cafe 
Bot, I stumbled onto the “Shiru Cafe Blog,” 
which promises to keep Shiru’s loyal customers 
abreast of the company’s progress. 


“Shiru,” an early blog post informed me, 
means “knowledge” in Japanese. After snooping 
around the blog for about an hour, it became 
clear to me that the people running Shiru have 
one epistemological fascination in particular: 
the “millenial.” 


Across the blog, articles abound with titles 
like “What a Millennial Wants.” 


“From hiring to training to attrition, leadership 
needs to understand what makes a ‘millennial’ 
tick,” advises one post. 


Another encourages businesses to woo 
millennials by appealing to their “freedom 
loving attitudes.”  


If you’re interested in hearing more of 
the cafe’s sage business advice, Shiru even 
published a short ebook this spring titled 
Recruiting: The Gen-Z Perspective. Among 
other New Age-y business strategies, the book 
encourages companies to develop an enticing 
corporate image as part of their recruiting 
process—because, as Shiru confidently asserts, 
“Gen Z is finely attuned to branding.” 


Millennials, Shiru seemed to be saying, are 
“principled,” but those principles can be easily 
bent into fodder for corporate recruitment with 
the right “branding.” Young people believe 
that “hierarchy is something that should be 
deconstructed”—but they can also be lured 
into a cafe barred to the general public by the 
promise of a free cup of joe. 


“Mr. Kakimoto, a millennial, understands the 
unique needs and opportunities facing students 
of his generation as well as employers seeking 
to hire the best and brightest,” reads yet another 
blog post on Shiru’s website. I, a millennial, 
would prefer that Mr. Kakimoto stick to 
snowboarding.
