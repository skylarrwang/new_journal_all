through boxes of Amistad Committee materials in 
the Whitney Library at the New Haven Museum. 
The library—full of local archival material—is 
snugly located in the back of the museum, at the 
end of a marble-floored hallway. I was the only 
person there, save Frances Skelton, the reference 
librarian, who helped me find the boxes in a back 
storage shelf. I was surrounded by pieces of New 
Haven’s history—genealogy books tracing back the 
oldest inhabitants of New Haven, yellowing maps 
of the city, centuries-old scrapbooks telling the 
story of a city of another time. As I paged through 
boxes of the Amistad Committee’s minutes, 
receipts, invoices, and typewritten letters, a 
narrative of its work over the years began to emerge. 
Here were the records of Marder’s efforts 
to do everything possible to 
bring the Amistad 
back into the public 
consciousness. “The original Amistad 
Committee of 1839 helped to shape the course of 
New Haven’s history,” he wrote in a letter to each 
member of the committee members on the eve 
of the opening ceremony that would kick of their 
yearlong effort. “We the Amistad Committee of 
1989 are also making history in our recognition 
of this event and providing a lasting tribute to its 
lessons.”


While Marder, Ives, and Edmonds led the 
struggle in the nineteen-eighties and -nineties, 
a younger contingent of New Haven history 
keepers have started a movement to help students 
remember all of America’s history, especially 
the stories that often go untold. Students for 
Educational Justice (S4EJ) is comprised of New 
Haven students, mostly high schoolers, who 
have successfully lobbied to include Black and 
Latinx history in all Connecticut public high 
school history curriculums with the passage of 
Connecticut House Bill 7052.


On an August afternoon, fifteen of S4EJ’s 
students sat in folding chairs arranged in a circle 
at the Institute Library. They quietly chatted 
among one another, until Chinedum Nnodum, 
the program director, asked the group: “Do you 
all know the story of the Amistad?” 
Solemn students shook their heads. In total, five 
out of the twelve students in attendance had heard 
about the Amistad. Anthony, a senior at Common 
Ground High School, said he had learned the story 
as a sophomore in a class on local history. Bryson, 
a senior at Cooperative Arts and Humanities High 
School, recalled that his grandfather told him a 
joke about the Amistad when he was twelve. But 
for most, the ship’s name didn’t ring any bells. 
“It’s very important you know the story,” 
Nnodum said. “Especially considering the work 
we are doing.” He explained that the people on 
board the Amistad were “enslaved people,” not

“slaves”—the latter suggesting that they were 
property or objects, not people. And he described 
how the event had complicated New Haveners’ 
perceptions of what it meant to be free or enslaved. 
“It helped shake entrenched racism in America 
and New Haven,” he said.


Briyana Mondesir, a member of S4EJ and a 
sophomore at Washington and Lee University, 
joined the group when she was a student at the 
Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School. 
“I felt so many times in school that the history 
we learned wasn’t history relevant to my life, or 
history essential for understanding identity in this 
space,” Mondesir told me at the meeting. “History 
can be really relevant if you can walk through it. 
So many stories of people of color took place right 
here in New Haven—it’s incredible.”


In 1999, the charter school network Achievement 
First opened the Amistad Academy Elementary 
School, Middle School, and High School in the 
Dwight and Newhallville neighborhoods of New 
Haven. The New Haven Museum now hosts a 
permanent exhibit featuring a large portrait of 
Cinqué, and Marder founded the Connecticut 
Freedom Trail, which marks 150 spots in 
Connecticut related to the abolitionist movement, 
including some recognizing the Amistad. 
But how many people who pass by these 
mentions of the Amistad remember the ship’s 
story? Walk around New Haven, and centuries of 
history surround you, from the names of streets 
and schools to lingering statues and monuments. 
These names have passed the test of time—but do 
we remember the stories and significance behind 
them? 


Every name that dots the city has its own story. 
It’s worth hearing the one that Marder, Ives, 
Edmonds, the students of S4EJ, and Hine and his 
crew have all worked to remember. 
“Walk around New Haven, 
and centuries of history 
surround you, from the 
names of streets and 
schools to lingering statues 
and monuments.”
