Yale’s virtual reality lab seeks to make high 
tech accessible.

t’s midnight in Times Square, and I can’t 
believe I’m here. Well, I do believe it. Taxis 
and black cars whiz by, dodging pedestrians. 
My pulse races as I merge into the nightlife of this 
city I love. Even though I’m due at my Yale lab in 
30 minutes, I feel a kind of subversive relief amid 
the late-night revelers as they shuffle past, some 
holding hands, others clutching shopping bags 
from luxury stores. The flashes of tourists’ cameras 
blur into neon advertisements illuminating the 
block. 

Suddenly, I’m jolted by a pedestrian’s iPhone 
ring. But that’s impossible: this virtual reality (VR) 
is designed to be soundless. I take off my headset. 
Back at Yale’s Center for Collaborative Arts 
and Media, known as the CCAM, Justin Berry 
scrambles to switch off an alarm on his phone. 
It’s a Saturday in late July, and Berry, a critic at 
the Yale School of Art, has nonetheless come into 
the office to talk with me about his work on VR and 
his pet project, the Blended Reality Collective. 
Launched at Yale during the summer of 2016 
with a grant from software company Hewlett-
Packard (HP), this project aims to facilitate 
students’ explorations of immersive technology. 
This includes both augmented reality (AR), which 
digitally alters or enhances the real world—like 
Pokémon Go; and VR, a computer-generated 
auditory and visual experience—like mine in 
Times Square—that makes a user feel present in 
an environment other than his or her actual one. 
Although we experience VR through an electronic 
headset, our bodies respond as if the simulations 
are real. In stressful ones, our hearts race. We feel 
afraid. Our brains can’t tell the difference. 

Members of Blended Reality consider Berry 
among immersive technology royalty. But when 
I sat with him in his office at the CCAM, I was 
relieved to find he wasn’t godly or intimidating. 
He wore a black baseball cap that he flipped 
backwards when putting on a VR headset. He had 
just stepped off a plane but didn’t seem jet-lagged; 
throughout our interview, he jumped to his feet to 
act out a point or shifted into a theatrical voice to 
emphasize an idea. 

Although it’s his second year leading Blended 
Reality, Berry doesn’t have a background in 
coding. “My master’s is actually in painting—
that’s how non-technical it goes,” he laughed. As 
we talked about his work at the intersection of art 
and technology, I commented on the beautiful 
photograph of a waterfall hanging on his wall, and 
he informed me that it was a still he’d taken from 
the background of a war game. “One of the things 
I’m really interested in is: what does it mean to 
look at something the way you aren’t supposed to 
look at it? What do you see when you look at a 
virtual world the same way you look at the real 
world—with the same critical lens?”

When I asked Berry for a tour of the facilities, I 
didn’t expect to end up in Times Square. The spell

of my disembodied experience in New York quickly 
subsided, though, and I wasn’t too disappointed 
to be brought back to reality. The wood-paneled, 
recently-remodeled CCAM is stacked with a large 
motion capture studio, VR suites that anyone can 
reserve, and cubbies with cameras and headsets 
spilling out of them.

Any Yale student can walk into Berry’s office 
at the CCAM and use this technology to make 
projects, like nursing school student Travis 
McCann’s 
medical 
training 
simulation 
or 
junior Noah Shapiro’s fantastical zoo—home to 
dancing bears and flying horses. Undergraduates, 
graduate students, and faculty, from fields as 
diverse as Nursing and Near Eastern Studies, 
have participated since the collective’s beginning. 
Teams receive an HP laptop, attend sporadic 
meetings and workshops, and present at two 
campus-wide showcases throughout the year. 
Groups also travel to HP’s headquarters in Palo 
Alto to present their creations.

This level of undergraduate involvement is 
unprecedented. For example, at Stanford, the 
premier VR developer, experts work on the 
technology behind closed doors. VR equipment 
rarely touches student hands. 

Yet, for all its democratic aspirations, Berry’s 
collective remains a relatively untapped resource 
here at Yale. Berry hopes more students will 
walk in, pitch projects, and join the program. 
His mission is to popularize immersive media 
technology like VR and to move it beyond geeks 
and gamers.              

Shapiro, the director of the Blended Reality 
collective’s undergraduate contingent, known as 
Yale Students in Immersive Media, first heard 
about the CCAM and its open doors when a close 
friend recommended that he check out the space 
last year. 
“I’m one of the luckiest people,” Shapiro 
gushed. “Like I think anyone else would, I just fell 
in love with it. It’s one of the coolest things.”  The 
excitement in his voice made me feel as if he was 
letting me in on one of Yale’s biggest secrets.   

The merit of VR is clear: it enables responsible 
users to see perspectives that would otherwise 
be inaccessible to them. The technology was 
famously called “the empathy machine” in a TED 
Talk by artist Chris Milk. In other words, even

digitally-inspired human emotions and sensations 
affect the real world. 

A VR experience on the Syrian refugee crisis, 
“Clouds Over Sidra,” helped accrue over a billion 
dollars in donations to the cause. After a pro-life 
lawmaker experienced Planned Parenthood’s VR 
simulation “Across the Line,” which simulates 
wading through a raucous crowd of anti-abortion 
activists outside an abortion clinic, he expressed 
anger over the struggles of women attempting to 
visit the reproductive health care provider in hostile 
territory. Following her immersion in a virtual 
solitary confinement experience, CNN producer 
Cathy Hackl said the “humanity switch” in her 
was flipped on. “I felt like I was actually walking in 
someone else’s shoes,” she said in a recent article 
by the online publication Narratively.

But if VR ends up in the wrong hands, it can 
be exploited to a harmful end. A violent VR 
experience can cause real trauma in the user, 
studies show. Technological philosophers Michael 
Madary and Thomas K. Metzinger wrote in a 2016 
paper in Robotics and A.I. journal, “Torture in a 
virtual environment is still torture. The fact that 
one’s suffering occurs while one is immersed 
in a virtual environment does not mitigate the 
suffering itself.” VR impacts one’s psychology and 
behavior, and its effects can be felt even after the 
goggles are off.

Critics of VR worry, too, about how this 
immersive 
technology 
will 
transform 
our 
understanding of what is “real” and change our 
relationship with the world around us. If someone
