ATM withdrawals at Costco. Strange: John never 
used ATMs, and Schless didn’t buy him groceries. 
The Imberts did, and they didn’t shop at Costco. 
Florida Light and Power. John had never visited 
Florida. Wasn’t that where Schless, who was in his 
late seventies, moved after retiring from his legal 
practice? 
An AARP policy.
An online subscription to Fort Lauderdale’s 
Sun-Sentinel. Florida, again.
Three hundred and fifty dollars in overdraft fees. 
Another AARP policy. 
A withdrawal of $765, in Florida.    
In total, between 2009 and 2012, Schless had spent 
more than $10,400 using unauthorized checks. 
(The closeness of this amount, in stolen funds, to 
the amount of money left in John’s accounts was 
pure coincidence.) That didn’t explain the tens of 
thousands of missing dollars, but it was a start. 
To Sharon’s surprise, the records also showed 
deposits. Why would Schless put money back 
into the account from which he was stealing? She 
decided to cross-check the deposit records with 
other bank statements. 

As it turned out, withdrawals from John’s mutual 
fund account matched the deposits, to the cent. 
Schless had been using John’s checking account as 
his personal bank. When the account ran low, he 
withdrew money from John’s savings to replenish 
it. Sharon had finally solved the mystery of the 
pink slip in the snack basket: the records showed 
that shortly after Schless called John asking for a 
money order worth $2,000, he had deposited $2,000 
in John’s checking account at TD Bank. So the 
pattern went: Withdraw from the savings account, 
deposit in the checking account, withdraw from 
the checking account, and, presumably, spend. 
Schless proved remarkably consistent.
Within three weeks of the $2,000 deposit at 
TD Bank, the money was gone. Sharon said, “He 
siphoned it all out.” 

As baby-boomers age and the number of mental 
health cases requiring conservators multiplies—in 
Connecticut, it has risen by more than fifty percent 
since 2012—so has the financial incentive for 
attorneys, or “public conservators,” to build larger 
caseloads. In 2016, then-probate administrator Paul 
Knierim created the designation “high-volume 
conservator,” also known as “contract conservator,” 
to provide a flat monthly rate of $86 per client to 
attorneys juggling more than forty conservatorships 
at a time. (Probate conducts criminal background 
checks on contract conservators.) “You can 
make a decent living if you mass-produce it,” 
John Keyes, who served as New Haven’s probate 
judge for thirty-two years before retiring in 2017, 
said of conservatorship. “It’s like selling enough 
hamburgers.”

I recently asked a pair of social workers about 
the on-the-ground effects of ballooning caseloads. 
Toshema Brooks and Nanteza Cohen work at 
New Haven’s Columbus House, a non-profit 
service provider for people experiencing or 
nearing homelessness. They described a pattern of 
disrespect, absenteeism, tardiness in paying bills, 
and outright verbal abuse by some conservators 
toward their clients. The two social workers said 
they witnessed one conservator call Brooks’ 
client—a middle-aged man who struggles with 
untreated mental illness, depression, and substance 
abuse—“lazy” and “stupid” when the four of them 
met in the conservator’s office. Brooks recalled the 
conservator saying to her client, “I know you’re a 
drunk. Are you fucking retarded?” 

On the road back to New Haven after the 
meeting, Brooks pulled the car over to calm her 
client. He was sobbing, she said, and he threatened 
to kill himself. 
“Do we need to call 911?” she asked him. He shook 
his head. “We’ll get you another conservator,” she 
assured him. “We’ll report him.” 

In April 2018, I listened to Brooks tell New 
Haven’s probate judge about the incident in court; 
he immediately agreed to remove the conservator. 
But removals do not ordinarily enter a conservator’s 
disciplinary record, and the probate court keeps no 
master list of them—a “hole in the system,” Keyes 
said. As a result, the conservator in question—who, 
according to Brooks and Cohen, often complains 
about his large caseload—will continue to manage 
the affairs of Connecticut’s most vulnerable. 

The Imberts’ second question, after they 
discovered where John’s money had gone, was how 
Schless had kept his theft a secret. As they recall 
events, when they first told Newington Probate 
Judge Robert Randich about the missing money, 
he brushed them off, saying that he didn’t believe 
Schless would have stolen from John. (Randich 
declined to comment on his interactions with the 
family because probate judges are not allowed to 
talk about specific cases.) 

The Imberts hired a forensic accountant and 
returned to Newington’s probate court the next

month. This time, Randich agreed that funds 
were missing from 2010, 2011, and 2012, but he 
declined to investigate earlier years, according to 
an affidavit. He ordered Schless to return about 
$36,000, but probate judges lack power to enforce 
their orders, so Schless never did. Randich chose 
not to refer the case to a state’s attorney, an option 
available to probate judges when they suspect a 
crime has taken place. 

“The system, as it’s set up, is highly dependent 
on the honesty of the people that serve within it,” 
Randich told me. He stressed how difficult it can 
be to detect fraud in a conservator’s accounting 
“when the numbers balance.” 

Sharon, however, maintains that anyone paying 
attention to John’s case would have noticed the 
signs. John’s bank records showed about $10,000 
in annual losses from one of his long-term savings 
accounts. By the time she met with Randich, 
she had spent “gross amounts” of time combing 
through bank records and compiling evidence 
to persuade the judge to take a second look at 
Schless’ accounting, only to find him powerless to 
enforce the law and unwilling to enlist someone 
who could. Sharon’s faith in probate evaporated as 
quickly as John’s savings.

As a last resort, the Imberts’ lawyer contacted a 
reporter at the Hartford Courant. When an article 
detailing his plight appeared in the Sunday paper, 
the Imberts’ phone began to ring. Among the 
many concerned callers was Brian Prelenski, a 
state’s attorney.  

Over the next year, with the help of a police 
detective, a forensic accountant, the Courant 
reporter, and Prelenski, the Imberts found that 
Schless had stolen at least $60,000, and possibly 
more than $100,000—a large enough sum to 
merit a criminal allegation of larceny in the first 
degree. Prelenski served Schless an extraditable 
arrest warrant mandating his speedy return to 
Newington, Connecticut. One early morning in 
December 2015, three years after he was removed 
as John’s conservator, Schless caught a flight 
to Connecticut from Boynton Beach, Florida. 
Around 5:30 a.m., he turned himself in at the 
Newington police station.   

On March 18, 2016, in New Britain Superior 
Court, Schless pleaded “no contest” to first-degree 
larceny, a felony. He was convicted of stealing 
$47,746 from John, the amount that fell within the 
statute of limitations. At age 78, Schless received 
a ten-year suspended sentence and no jail time, 
on account of his age. In court, John read from a 
prepared victim statement. 
“In the past, I trusted people, and trusted lawyers 
and the courts,” he said. “Now I don’t trust people 
anymore.”

After John’s story made headlines in the 
state capital, Connecticut’s legislature passed a 
law mandating random audits of conservators’ 
accounting. But piecemeal reform, including a 
law establishing conservators’ duty to intervene 
in their clients’ lives as little as possible, has 
historically failed to change conservator conduct, 
partly because probate judges have little power to 
enforce the law, and partly because many of them 
work part-time, limiting their ability to conduct 
rigorous checks. Yale Sterling law professor John 
Langbein, a longtime critic of Connecticut’s 
probate courts, believes conservatorship should be 
exported altogether from the probate system, which 
he characterized in an interview as inefficient and 
“corrupt.” Sandra Sherlock-White, an elder law 
attorney who served on a work group to revise 
Connecticut’s conservatorship statute following a 
high-profile case in 2014, told me she has noticed a 
“disconnect” between the letter of the law—which 
she helped to craft—and the reality on the ground. 
“When conservators abuse 
their power, the betrayal 
can be psychologically 
devastating and financially 
disastrous.”

“The trouble is more in the practice. That’s where 
the rubber doesn’t meet the road,” she said. “There 
are still violations at times.” 

Former probate administrator Paul Knierim 
attributes those violations to “human frailties”; 
others, like Langbein, Brooks, Cohen, and Sharon, 
blame them on a frail system. And when the system 
fails, not everyone has dedicated relatives who 
are willing and able to invest hundreds of hours 
tracing the financial history of a rogue conservator. 

On her front porch, Sharon, wiping away angry 
tears, said of probate, “I don’t even want to say it’s 
a system. It’s a rubber stamp.”  

When John and I spoke on the phone, he 
was looking forward to his upcoming stint at 
Camp Harkness, the camp for disabled adults in 
Waterford. Sharon, Jim, and I sat on the front 
stoop of their home in Niantic and talked to John 
on speaker phone. He’d be heading to camp soon. 
What was he most excited to do? “See my friends,” 
he said ponderously. Then, he remembered the 
lake. “And swim!” 

Later, I asked him how he felt about Schless. 
“At first, he was O.K. But it made me upset, what 
he did,” John said.  
“Hey, skipper,” Sharon said gently. “Do you 
remember what you told the judge you wanted 
Michael to do?”
“Oh,” John replied, pausing. Schless had 
exploited him impersonally, via bank transactions 
and from a distance; now, John wanted Schless 
to witness the vulnerabilities he had exploited 
firsthand, perhaps through community service that 
could actually help others with John’s disability. 
“I wanted him to work with somebody who has 
cerebral palsy,” John said. But the judge declined 
to issue an order. “Candidly,” she said of Schless, 
“I don’t trust him.”  

As the investigation unfolded, the third, and 
most difficult, question the Imberts faced was how 
to explain the situation to John. He had trouble 
understanding Schless’s part in the changes to his 
life and his body. “He can’t conceive of anybody 
hurting another person,” Sharon told me. In 
2012, the Imberts footed the hefty bill for camp, 
but they knew they couldn’t afford to keep paying 
long-term. Meanwhile, John’s teeth had started to 
rot. Without home health aides, he often failed 
to brush them properly, and his age and physical 
disabilities made him more vulnerable to dental 
decay. Sharon said, “It was a process of telling 
him, ‘You’re losing your teeth because, you may 
not go to camp because.” 

Though John recovered about $60,000 in stolen 
funds between the criminal case and a civil suit, 
the Imberts say Schless stole tens of thousands of 
dollars more. They worry that the recovered money 
won’t cover the care John will need as he ages. In 
the year after the trial alone, he attended weekly 
therapy sessions to manage his psychological 
trauma. In the absence of his home health aides, 
his dentist pulled all of his lower teeth. 
Jim, in a Harley Davidson t-shirt, listened as John 
spoke over the phone. “We’re asking about the 
Schless Mess, skipper,” Jim reminded his brother 
when John struggled to understand a question. 
With John, the Imberts try to strike a light tone. In 
private, however, their mood darkens. Jim believes 
conservatorship is “a broken system,” and he holds 
the State of Connecticut responsible. Sharon 
counts the endangerment of John’s stay at Camp 
Harkness as one of Schless’s cruelest offenses. And 
whenever she sees John, his lower dentures remind 
her of the cost of Schless’s conservatorship.
“John doesn’t need a laugh, doesn’t spend,” 
Sharon said. “If he has what he needs, he’s happy.”
