AT HISTORY’S HELM
A replica of the Amistad slave ship sets sail 
on the Long Island Sound.
T
he enslaved people would have slept 
down here,” the shipmate told us, 
gesturing to the room. “They would 
have been among the barrels and other cargo on 
the ship. On the night of their mutiny, they crept 
onto the deck of the ship where the staff and crew 
members were sleeping.” 

Twelve small bunks with cloth curtains drawn 
across them lined the walls of the hold, alongside 
a mini kitchenette with a sink. The lighting was 
darker and the air cooler underneath the ship’s 
deck, where we could hear the murmurs and 
footsteps of the teachers and their families above, 
buzzing with excitement for the upcoming sail on 
the Long Island Sound. 

An hour ago, I had crossed the gangplank onto 
a fully functional replica of the Amistad, a two-
masted schooner that in 1839 was the scene of the 
rebellion of fifty-three enslaved Mende people. 
After successfully overtaking their captors aboard 
the ship, the Mende attempted to sail back to 
Sierra Leone. But their plan was thwarted by the 
Spanish navigators who stealthily turned the ship 
in the opposite direction at night. Two days later, 
the ship landed in the New Haven Harbor. Soon 
began what would be one of the first human rights 
cases to make it to the U.S. Supreme Court.

When the Amistad docked in New Haven 
in 1839, the courts did not know how to legally 
classify the Mende people on board. Should they 
be punished for their rebellion? Granted freedom? 
Sent home? On the one hand, the owners of the 
Amistad had engaged in illegal activity: the U.S. 
and Spain, where the ship was from, had already 
pledged to abolish the international slave trade. 
On the other hand, slavery itself was still legal 
in the U.S., and mutiny and murder were not; 
the Mende had killed two crewmates during the 
rebellion. The courts imprisoned all fifty-three of 
the Mende people, including their leader Sengbe 
Pieh, or “Cinqué,” in the New Haven jail for 
two years, until their trial finished. But the court 
proceedings, in which John Quincy Adams acted 
as the captors’ attorney, became a rallying cry for 
the national abolition movement. In 1841, the 
Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that 
the Mende had acted as free men and fought to 
escape illegal confinement. Thirty-five of them 
chose to return to Sierra Leone the next year.

Standing under the low ceilings of the ship 
hatch, I thought of a past when the walls were 
gone, the empty cavern filled with food, drink—
and people, living in inhumane conditions, torn 
from their loved ones and home country. But 
as the shipmate led us back up the hatch onto 
the deck above, we sailed past Lighthouse Point 
Beach, past the shoreline houses in East Haven, 
through blue waters below blue skies that faded to 
orange and pink. The ship’s shrouds stretched up 
to the sky with crewmates climbing up and down 
them, the white sail billowed,  and the “Amistad” 
pendant curved with the wind.  While the replica 
ship was meant to commemorate the original’s 
harrowing history, it is also meant to inspire a new 
generation of students to try to end the legacy of 
slavery and celebrate the teachers making this 
happen. The ship hearkens back into the past, but 
it also sails forward.

I had signed up for a New Haven public school 
teacher “sunset sail” organized by Discovering 
Amistad, the non-profit that now owns the replica 
ship. Built in 1999, the ship has a crew of between 
six and twelve people at any point and sails around 
the Long Island Sound, docking in New Haven, 
Bridgeport, and New London, among other towns 
on the Connecticut and Southern New York 
coastline.

Jason Hine, Discovering Amistad’s chief 
educator, enthusiastically greeted each teacher as 
they boarded the ship. Wearing a baseball cap and 
a Discovering Amistad polo, he stood near its bow 
during the sail, chatting with the teachers around 
him. He has told this ship’s story hundreds of 
times. Before joining Discovering Amistad, Hine 
served as a high school Social Studies teacher in 
nearby Lyme, Connecticut. Now, he organizes 
educational sessions about the Amistad in local 
schools, and he takes students out to sea.

Aboard the replica ship, Hine and his crew 
show students how different parts of the ship tell 
different stories. At the helm, students can see 
the wheel that the Spanish crewmembers secretly 
turned towards New Haven at night. Students stop 
at the hatchway from which the Mende emerged 
on the night they took over the ship, and as they 
walk along the deck, they trace their hands on 
railings and structures similar to those from the 
original ship—made of lumber from Sierra Leone. 
Hine sees the ship as a chance not only to 
engage with the past, but also the present. 
“We are talking about the Amistad,” Hine 
told me, “and almost two hundred years later, 
we’re still wrestling with the same issues.” When 
Hine asks students how the story of the Amistad 
connects to the present, they connect the 
dehumanization of the enslaved Africans to “how 
Donald Trump talks about Mexicans or people 
from other countries” or the plight of the Mende 
to “Colin Kaepernick taking a knee in solidarity 
with Black Lives Matter.” Hine said that he hopes 
that students learn to become comfortable with 
having a conversation about race.

Hine isn’t the first person in New Haven’s 
recent history to find and celebrate the story of the 
Amistad. In 1986, Reverend Peter Ives was digging 
around the back of his Center Church on the 
Green when he found dusty pamphlets describing 
the history of the Amistad in a “very brief fashion.” 
Ives had lived in New Haven in his teenage years 
but knew nothing of the event.

“I began to investigate what this was, and I 
realized that no one in New Haven at that time 
had any idea what this was all about,” Ives told me 
over the phone. “The fact that for years and years 
this story had not been told and was not known 
was a real tragedy, that kids over almost a hundred 
years or so really didn’t know this story.”

That night, he called up the late Reverend 
Edward Edmonds, a prominent African-American 
minister from the United Church of Christ on 
Dixwell Avenue, and Al Marder, a New Haven 
activist for causes ranging from world peace 
to communism. The three decided to ask then-
Mayor Biagio DiLieto to appoint an Amistad 
Committee comprising one hundred reverends, 
scholars, and popular community figures, half 
of whom would be African-American and the 
other half white. After two years of preparation, 
the committee celebrated the 150th anniversary 
with months of lectures, banquets, dramatic 
readings, and youth marches, along with video, 
opera, and book productions, and an Amistad 
Choir. The centerpiece of the celebration was 
a commemorative statue that still stands today 
in front of City Hall, featuring Cinqué in three 
settings—his homeland (in Sierra Leone), the 
courtroom where the trial took place, and in New 
Haven after his freedom.

I first learned about Ives, Edmonds, and Marder’s 
efforts on a snowy March afternoon, sifting 
“The fact that for years 
and years this story had 
not been told and was 
not known was a real 
tragedy.”
