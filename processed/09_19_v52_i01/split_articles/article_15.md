I 
strain to pick up Abduweli Ayup’s voice 
over our WhatsApp call. A Uighur linguist, 
activist, and now refugee, he sketches a bleak 
outline of his detention in Chinese prison in 2013, 
after attempting to fund a new Uighur language 
school in Xinjiang. His descriptions are graphic: a 
yard full of detainees bombarded with explosives 
that induced vomiting and tears, the forced 
collection of DNA via blood and saliva.
“They don’t just have my fingerprints, they have 
my toe prints,” he mentions, chuckling.


Earlier this year, The New York Times revealed 
that Kenneth K. Kidd, Professor Emeritus 
of Genetics at the Yale School of Medicine, 
inadvertently 
aided 
Chinese 
authorities 
in 
surveilling Uighurs like Ayup. Li Caixia, the chief 
forensic physician at China’s principal police 
authority, spent eleven months at Kidd’s lab in 
2014, bringing DNA samples and expertise back 
to China. 


Kidd, whose work centers around forensics, 
maintains that he didn’t have concerns about 
working with Li Caixia. He frequently collaborates 
with law enforcement, and has helped push for 
the use of DNA in courts to exonerate the wrongly 
convicted. In an interview with NPR this July, 
he maintains that he did “nothing wrong” and 
shouldn’t be expected to know “everything that’s 
going to happen in the future.” 


But a closer look at Kidd puts his naiveté into 
serious question. This isn’t the first time he has 
been involved in a genomics project accused of 
racist motives. Kidd’s relationship with China 
is also ethically suspect; he has collaborated 
with scientists who misuse genetic research for 
nationalist purposes and received funding from 
Chinese governmental institutions.


Was Kidd truly unaware of the plight of Uighurs 
like Ayup, as he claims? Or did he put scientific 
achievement first, turning a blind eye to the 
agenda of the Chinese surveillance state?

Kidd is no stranger to ethical controversy. In 
the 1990s, he was a key figure and project-planner 
for the Human Genome Diversity Project, or 
HGDP, an effort by the late Luca Cavalli-Sforza 
of Stanford to study genetic diversity by gathering 
DNA samples from all over the planet. The project 
never acquired enough funding, however, and was 
quickly mired in allegations of racism. Cavalli-
Sforza mentions Kidd’s involvement in the initial 
planning stages. Kidd would pen Cavalli-Sforza’s 
obituary in The American Journal of Human 
Genetics decades later.


The HGDP’s original focus was collecting DNA 
samples from indigenous people who, according 
to the project, were “in danger of dying out.” 
Cavalli-Sforza and his collaborators hoped to 
form a database that could help study migration 
histories, noting that isolated populations were 
best suited for this task. Indigenous activist 
groups such as the Indigenous Peoples’ Council 
on Biocolonialism struck back, pointing out that 
the scientists’ methods were exploitative. These 
groups argued that “theories of migration,” which 
Kidd studied, “[could] be used to challenge 
aboriginal territorial claims or rights to land.”


Jonathan Marks, a professor of anthropology at 
the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, was 
also an outspoken critic of the project during its 
heyday in the nineties. According to him, “The 
project was framed in the science of the nineteen-
sixties, which involved saying anything to get a 
syringe full of native blood and then buggering 
off with it, with full ownership of the ‘biological

THE RESEARCHER’S 
RESPONSIBILITY
A Yale professor collected DNA that helped 
China persecute its Uighur population. Is 
the researcher responsible?
