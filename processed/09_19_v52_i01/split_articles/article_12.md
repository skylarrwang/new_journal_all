uses VR long enough, can it replace real life?
This idea was recently tested in an experiment 
described by Jeremy Bailenson, the founding 
director of Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction 
Lab, in his book Experience on Demand. Bailenson 
writes of how a German psychologist conducted 
a study on himself in which he spent a full day 
and night in a virtual reality experience. Over the 
course of those twenty-four hours, he began to 
confuse the virtual reality experience for his actual 
reality.

Even so, Bailenson is not deeply concerned 
that computer-generated experiences will replace 
reality. He writes, “The most amazing moment 
in VR is the moment when you take the [head-
mounted display] off and are flooded with the 
full gamut of subtle sensory inputs that VR can’t 
capture—fine gradations of light, smells, the 
sensation of air moving on your skin…These are 
all sensations that are incredibly difficult, if not 
impossible, to effectively simulate in a virtual 
world. In a strange way, VR helps you to appreciate 
the real world more.” 

Still, many critics worry about the long-term 
social, mental, and physical effects of futuristic 
and dizzying head-trips to the Great Wall of China 
or the moons of Mars. In December 2017, the first 
VR-related death occurred. In Russia, a user was 
so immersed in VR that he forgot the physical 
layout of his room, fell through a glass table, and 
bled to death, according to Balienson’s research.

“There is no doubt that the concerns are real—
distraction, addiction, simulator sickness, privacy 
concerns, and unethical use cases,” Bailenson told 
me. The key, though, is “to be transparent about 
these concerns now, and to design VR platforms, 
hardware, and policy norms to ensure the medium 
thrives while minimizing the downsides.”

When I put on the headset at CCAM, the white-
walled computer classroom transformed into New 
York City’s bright and colorful midnight in Times 
Square. I am not surprised that VR users say they 
become so immersed in the experience they forget 
their body remains in the physical world. 

VR’s immense and still evolving power, many 
experts warn, demands that users and creators 
wield the technology carefully.

The creation of socially responsible VR content 
depends on who rules the virtual realm. This 
fundamental concern, says Berry, is at the root of 
his collective’s philosophy. Tech companies such 
as Facebook and Google are racing to develop the 
virtual field and reap its financial rewards, perhaps 
leaving social and ethical obligations behind.  
 “If we leave it up to industry, no one cares,” 
Berry said. “I think the goal is to get the people that 
care about this stuff to ask difficult questions, to 
consider it a moral issue, a social issue, a cultural 
issue.” 

While acknowledging the ambiguous ethical 
questions of virtual reality—and its potential 
dangers—Berry defended his lab’s democratic 
approach. He said the collective creates a low-stakes 
environment for experimentation with emerging 
media and opens the otherwise exclusive field of 
blended reality to a diversity of perspectives.

“The most powerful piece of technology we 
actually have is just our open doors,” he added, 
letting out a burst of laughter as he scanned the 
lab’s expensive, state-of-the-art equipment.

A blended reality utopia? Perhaps. It remains to 
be seen whether this technology has the power to 
withstand the worst of us. Meanwhile, I’m open to 
immersing myself in our collective imagination.
