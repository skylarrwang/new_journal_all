specimen’ and no obligation to the participant.”
Marks was an associate professor at Yale at the 
time. He spoke to Kidd privately about his many 
concerns regarding the project’s ethics, and 
recalled that “[Kidd] did not take criticism well.” 
Kidd allegedly forbade a graduate student of his 
from speaking to Marks, whom he believed to be 
“dangerous.” 
In hopes of salvaging the project, Kidd and the 
other members of the North American Regional 
Committee would co-author a 1997 paper outlining 
a proposed set of ethical standards. This paper 
urged researchers to “learn as much as possible” 
about the populations they were studying and 
mandated that they consult anthropologists before 
considering genetic sampling. In essence, it was 
a list of lessons learned, lessons that could’ve 
prevented the predicament Kidd is in today.

HGDP never made it off the ground. But 
that didn’t stop Kidd from reviving the project 
under a different name—ALFRED, or the Allele 
Frequency Database. Ken Weiss, a former leader 
of the HGDP, confirmed that the two projects 
are highly similar: both are free, public databases 
with DNA sequence results and genotypes from as 
many populations as possible.

ALFRED has been Kidd’s pet project since 
1999. Currently, it contains data on DNA samples 
from 2,942 Uighurs, most of which were collected 
in China over the last two decades. Two hundred 
and seventy five of the subjects are from Urumqi—
the same city where Ayup stood in a line with over 
a hundred detainees signing paperwork he would 
never read, potentially giving away the rights to 
his own DNA.

According to Weiss, Kidd originally “put 
together ALFRED as a database of what was 
available.” But in the nineties, databases mostly 
contained European DNA, due to the Western 
focus of scientific research. This posed a problem, 
given that genomics research often requires data 
from a breadth of populations. 
 China’s return to the international stage via 
Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 policy of Reform and 
Opening Up came at an opportune time. China 
represents 20 percent of the world’s population. 
Access to these DNA samples, and cooperation 
with government gatekeepers was crucial for 
Western geneticists.

Since the nineties, the Chinese government 
has invested in large-scale genetic databases. Its
