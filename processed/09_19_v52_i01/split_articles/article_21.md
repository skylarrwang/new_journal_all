the City of New Haven. For three weeks, he showed 
up on time to every shift, was polite, and collected 
trash as efficiently as he could. “I actually started 
to enjoy it,” he said. “It paid really well.”
But by the end of the month, his supervisor 
told him he was letting him go. “The job was just 
a temporary position,” Morant remembers the 
supervisor explaining. But Morant thinks that his 
background check had raised a red flag.
The 
unemployment 
rate 
for 
formerly 
incarcerated people is five times higher than the 
general rate, according to a 2018 Prison Policy 
Initiative study. Ninety percent of United States 
employers use online criminal record reports 
before hiring for some, if not all, positions. Studies 
show that employers who do learn of applicants’ 
criminal histories tend to discriminate against 
them.
“When an employer finds out you have a 
criminal record, he’s likely going to hire someone 
else if he can,” McGraw told me. Morant had first 
written to McGraw ten years ago, and they’ve been 
in touch ever since. Once he got out and struggled 
to find employment, she wrote a letter for future 
employers, explaining his unique circumstances. 
It didn’t always work.
In a job interview at the Children’s Center in 
Hamden, Morant supplied the letter and began 
explaining his story. After skimming the letter for a 
few seconds, the center’s director cut him off and 
apologized.
“There’s got to be more to your story. You got 
convicted,” Morant remembers the director saying. 
He didn’t get the job.

The classic mechanism for overturning unlawful 
imprisonment is filing a petition for the writ of 
habeas corpus, claiming the state is unlawfully 
holding, imprisoning, or detaining someone. 
When these petitions are effective, incarcerated 
individuals are brought to trial to determine if the 
court made a legal or factual error in ordering an 
individual’s detention. 
In rare cases, these petitions succeed. Scott 
Lewis won his exoneration through habeas 
corpus litigation. But a habeas corpus action 
isn’t possible for Morant anymore, since he is 
no longer incarcerated. “In order to file habeas 
corpus petitions, the state must have your body,” 
Ken Rosenthal, Morant’s current attorney, told 
me, referring to the phrase’s Latin roots. 
McGraw and Rosenthal both say that Morant 
has just one avenue left: a pardon. Typically, 
political executives—presidents, governors, or 
pardon boards—can issue pardons to convicted 
criminals. For people who have shown remorse 
for their actions, who face lengthy time in jail 
for a low-level crime or who were wrongfully 
convicted, pardons can be a powerful last resort. 
In Connecticut, pardons erase convictions from 
criminal records, giving back crucial civil rights to 
those convicted, wrongfully or not. 
Rosenthal, Morant’s seasoned New Haven 
criminal defense attorney (“Ken’s my angel,” 
Morant tells me), tries to remain optimistic, 
but recognizes that a pardon based on claims 
of innocence will be difficult to achieve. “It’s 
simply never been done before in Connecticut,” 
Rosenthal tells me from his ground-floor office in 
New Haven. “I’m not saying we can’t do it; we can. 
If anyone can, Stef can.”
 Morant and Rosenthal meet once a week to work 
on the pardon petition, which will be submitted 
soon. The average turn around rate for pardon 
petitions is one year, so Morant believes that by 
this time next year, he’ll have an answer.
Morant and Rosenthal hope the pardon process 
will work out. But for the people whom the 
pardon process has failed, the consequences can 
be devastating.


In 1985, Chris Conover, a Maryland native, 
had been wrongfully convicted of two murders. 
But DNA evidence acquired by the Innocence 
Project in 2001 pointed to different suspects, 
casting a shadow on Conover’s conviction. In late 
June 2003, the state prosecutors agreed to vacate 
the conviction, based on the DNA evidence, but 
they also maintained that Conover was guilty and 
vowed to retry him. 
However, leading up to the retrial, prosecutors 
offered Conover an Alford plea deal, allowing 
him to maintain his innocence on record while 
acknowledging that a jury could convict him in 
a retrial. The Alford plea would enable Conover 
to go home immediately. If he refused, he would 
have to take his chances with trial. 
Although the Alford plea deal would not 
exonerate Conover, he took the deal. Conover’s

mother was ill, and he wanted to be home with her 
as soon as he could. “It would not have been worth 
it to put my mother and my loved ones through 
another trial,” he told a Baltimore Sun reporter. 
And he worried that he might lose in a retrial 
and be sent back to prison. “I know that I’ve already 
walked into one courtroom and been wrongfully 
convicted,” he told Prison Legal News. He knew it 
could happen again.
In 2009, his defense team worked to petition 
then-Governor of Maryland, Martin O’Malley, 
for a pardon, which would entitle Conover to 
state compensation and would push the world to 
recognize that he was, in fact, innocent. Three 
years later, O’Malley rejected the petition. Online, 
the pardon commission advises petitioners: “Avoid 
trying to make excessive excuses for your crime and 
arguing away your guilt. Whatever you feel about 
the crime, you have already been found guilty.”

 According to Conover’s wife, Conover struggled 
with panic attacks, depression and anxiety, 
knowing that people around him still believed he 
was guilty. 
Darcy McGraw told me that innocent people 
who take time served and Alford plea deals face 
additional layers of trauma that exonerated people 
do not: those who haven’t been exonerated “have 
to cope with all the challenges of reentering society 
and know that the world will never recognize their 
innocence. It’s a double bind.”
In 2015, three years after O’Malley’s decision, 
Conover took his own life. His seventy-word 
obituary online mentions his wife, his family, 
his small hometown—Towson, Maryland—and 
directions to his funeral. It never proclaims that 
Conover was wrongfully convicted. It does not 
mention his crime. Rather, the last line reads:
“In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made 
in Christopher’s name to The Innocence Project, 
www.innocenceproject.org”

I visited Linda Morant, Stefon’s mother, at her 
home in New Haven. It’s a cozy white two-story 
house, with careful pruning and all the marks of a 
home that has been lived in by generations of family 
members. The walls are decked with portraits of 
parents, grandparents, kids, and grandkids, and 
photos from church, graduations, and vacations; 
milestones that have come and gone.
When I asked her how she passed twenty-one 
years without Morant, she pulled out a carefully 
saved letter from a dusty Bible, in which she had 
tucked away dozens of family photos, diplomas, 
and postcards among her most cherished psalms.

“I missed my family. I needed to come home,” Stefon Morant said. “I didn’t want to be in a cage.”

She showed me a letter she had drafted to Judge 
Hadden, the judge who handed Morant his life 
sentence. “I am asking you your honor to please 
grant my son a new trial,” she read from a letter 
she had never sent, her voice full of the despair 
that only a mother could conjure, twenty-five years 
after the fact. Growing desperate, Linda had also 
written to someone else: God.  
Dear God please release my son Morant from 
prison I thank you God and for all of my family and 
the world to be bless. Amen. 12/6/06 
Now that Morant is home, she finds herself 
praying for something new: his exoneration. “He’s 
free now, and I thank the Lord for that, but there’s 
more to be done,” she tells me.
She pulled out every school portrait of Morant 
and every family photo she could find. Sitting 
next to each other on her blue couch, we flipped 
through photos and watched Morant grow up. 
Photos of him with missing teeth and ears too 
big for his face were replaced by junior high 
school photos of a boy with a small moustache 
and frayed blue jeans. I saw him graduate night 
school, diploma in hand, beaming as he hugged 
his mom in his blue cap and gown. I saw him carry 
his twins as infants in a hotel room, buy them a 
stuffed animal that was even taller than they were 
for their second birthday, and drive them around 
in his blue Nissan.
She also showed me pictures of memories that 
Stefon had missed: his daughter at her middle 
school graduation, a family vacation down to 
South Carolina, a family cook-out for the fourth 
of July. 
The next week, I met up with Morant and his 
attorney, Ken Rosenthal, in New Haven. At the 
end of the meeting, when I began to pack up my 
stuff, Morant cut me off.
“What do you see when you look at that 
painting?”
He was staring at an abstract piece of art on 
Rosenthal’s wall, a work with earthy blues, greens, 
and browns. I saw splattered paints that seemed to 
be dripping towards a foggy lake. When I told him 
that I frankly didn’t really understand it, he threw 
his head back and laughed, beaming with a smile 
that covered his whole face.
 “Keep looking at it. Look, it’s crying right now. 
Or maybe it’s raining. I don’t know yet. But I’ll 
figure it out.”

When I first called Morant to request an 
interview, he told me that he was glad I’d be 
writing about him, but that he was busy— “there’s 
a lot I have to catch up on,” he said. He had to 
visit his family members, walk his mom’s dog, go 
to work, apply for new jobs, and meet with his 
attorneys. He would only be able to meet with me 
at 9 a.m. at Payne Whitney gym. “I work out every 
day because that’s my daily therapy. You can walk 
on the treadmill next to me, and we can talk,” he 
said.
 It turned out that the gym was closed, so 
Morant met me instead at Patricia’s, a diner on 
Whalley Avenue. In between bites of potatoes and 
a runny omelette, he walked me through his story, 
beginning with the day Raucci, the detective, first 
called him and asked to meet him at a local gas 
station. “I still wish I hadn’t called him back,” he 
said. “I didn’t know better.”
Twenty-eight years after that initial phone call, 
after struggling to find well-paying, consistent 
employment, Morant has found work he loves at 
the Connecticut Renaissance, a halfway house for 
formerly incarcerated men who are reintegrating 
into society. He said he tries to work as many hours 
a week as possible to save up money. “It’s been 
tight for me,” he says. “I can’t buy the things I need 
to buy, and I have kids.” One day, Morant hopes 
to chip away at the school-to-prison pipeline by 
opening up a mentoring program for at-risk young 
men in New Haven. 
But for now, he reminds himself that he is doing 
meaningful work. “It doesn’t pay much, but I think 
I’m doing what I’m meant to be doing. It’s God’s 
work,” he tells me.
Although Morant is now stably employed, he 
knows that many employers still cannot look past 
his criminal record. As his pardon petition process 
moves forward, he longs to have his conviction 
erased from his record, closure after his twenty-one 
years in prison, and some semblance of justice.
