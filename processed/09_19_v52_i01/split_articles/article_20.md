EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Stefon Morant wears his heart on his 
sleeve. When I ask him to tell me about the 
people that matter most to him, he points 
at the tattoos covering his arms.
“They’re here.”
His left bicep loudly announces “Kimberly 
Forever,” after his wife, Kimberly Morant. Her 
name is enveloped by a fallen cross and a bed of 
red roses, a nod to their Christian faith.
Stefon’s right bicep bares his oldest tattoo: 
“MOM,” it declares in faded cursive. The design, 
a black heart, surrounded by a wreath of leaves, is 
simple and reminds him of a simpler time. “I don’t 
know where I would be without my mom,” he tells 
me. His children’s names are tattooed on his chest. 
He has seven—Twyla, Stefon, Julien, Christian, 
Mia, Jaala, and Prince.
His brothers Frank and Lee are his best friends, 
and his right forearm is covered by a portrait of 
Julian Morant, his youngest brother. In the tattoo, 
Julian wears a bow tie and tuxedo, and Stefon 
points at his arm, beaming. The tattoo is fading—
Stefon has had it for one year now—but I can make 
out a subtle facial rash on Julian’s tattooed portrait 
and drooping eyes, signs of Lupus. Julian died 
from Lupus in 2014, just months before Stefon was 
released from prison after serving twenty-one years 
for a crime he did not commit.

On June 17, 2015, Stefon Morant returned home 
from prison after accepting a deal from prosecutors 
which slashed his seventy-year sentence to twenty-
five years. While the deal allowed him to come 
home immediately, it also failed to exonerate him 
of his charges and limited his avenues for redress. 
An FBI investigation revealed that Morant and 
his co-defendant were wrongfully convicted, and 
the New Haven State’s Attorney acknowledged 
in court that Morant’s conviction rested on false 
testimony from the State’s key witness. Yet Morant 
is still a registered felon.
Morant is far from alone. High-profile wrongful 
conviction cases across the United States have 
involved deals enabling wrongfully convicted 
individuals to return home without being 
exonerated. Although no studies have tracked 
the prevalence of such deals, in September of 
2017, ProPublica investigated ten cases in the last 
nineteen years in which defendants across the 
country who had significant evidence pointing 
to their innocence chose to plead guilty in order 
to reduce their sentences. For these individuals, 
re-entering society with a criminal record comes 
with financial, social, and emotional barriers. 
Four years after his homecoming, Morant 
continues to face challenges related to his felony 
conviction. Still, he stands by his choice to accept 
the deal.
“I missed my family. I needed to come home,” 
he said. “I didn’t want to be in a cage.”


In 1994, Detective Vincent Raucci Jr., a corrupt 
detective on the payroll of a New Haven drug 
kingpin, was investigating the 1990 murder of 
former New Haven alderman Ricardo Turner and 
his partner. Morant’s good friend, Scott Lewis, 
owed Raucci $10,000 in a cocaine-related debt, 
and when Lewis could not pay, Raucci began 
collecting evidence to frame Lewis for the murder. 
According to a 1997 FBI investigation of Lewis and 
Morant’s convictions, Raucci coerced vulnerable 
witnesses to make his case. His star witness was Ovil 
Ruiz, a teenager with a history of schizophrenia 
and a criminal record. 
When Raucci attempted to pressure Morant 
into testifying against Lewis, he refused. In return, 
the detective sought revenge: he framed Morant 
for driving Lewis to the murder scene, a felony 
under Connecticut law. After a three-month trial, 
the jury found Morant and Lewis guilty of two 
counts of felony murder and two counts of murder, 
respectively.

A few days later, Morant returned to court to 
receive his sentence. 
“Mr. Morant, what do you have to say?” asked 
the presiding judge, according to court transcripts.
“I don’t understand why am I being convicted of 
a crime I didn’t commit…I didn’t commit a crime. 
I never committed a crime. I never hurt nobody in 
my life. I’m innocent your Honor. I leave it with 
that.”
To the judge, Morant’s words rang hollow.
 “If you sat on this jury and you listened to this 
case,” the judge stated to Morant’s family and a 
packed courtroom, “you would have found that 
man guilty of these crimes. He was convicted 
because he is guilty. He committed these crimes.” 
With that, Morant was sentenced to seventy years 
in prison. 
For the next twenty-one years, Stefon Morant 
maintained his innocence from behind bars. He 
remained hopeful: in 2014, Lewis won his freedom 
after a Connecticut state judge agreed that he 
had been unconstitutionally incarcerated. Led by 
Yale Law School professor Brett Dignam, Lewis’ 
legal team of nearly fifty Yale and Columbia law 
students had presented new evidence, including 
an FBI investigation that showed Detective 
Raucci’s involvement with the drug trade and 
his willingness to threaten key witnesses. Over 
the course of six years, the law students threw 
themselves into Lewis’ case, driving all across 
the tristate area to assemble Lewis’ record and, 
ultimately, win his freedom.

But Morant didn’t have fifty law students backing 
him. While Lewis’s team spent years assembling 
records, working with private investigators, and 
conducting interviews with people who had known 
Detective Raucci, Morant was represented by one 
solo practitioner who barely communicated with 
him, filed no pleadings, and devoted fewer than 
twenty hours to working with Morant over the 
course of two years.

On June 9, 2015, a corrections officer walked 
by and slipped Morant a pass for the visitation 
room. He stepped out of the cell doors and walked 
through two sets of metal detectors into the large 
visitation room.
Morant’s attorney was waiting to speak with him. 
“The state has a deal for you,” he remembers 
his attorney saying. “You could be out next week, 
if you want.” As a result of Lewis’s victory, state 
prosecutors had approached Morant’s attorney 
with a rare deal. They were willing to reduce 
Morant’s seventy-year sentence to the lowest 
possible sentence allowed in Connecticut for a 
felony: twenty-five years, minus four years because 
of Morant’s good behavior. And he had already 
served twenty-one years. 
If Morant took the deal, he could be home 
immediately.

But there was a catch. If he took this deal and 
returned home, which attorneys call a “time 
served” deal, Morant would not be exonerated. He 
would not receive compensation from the state of 
Connecticut, be issued an apology from his city, 
or have a clean record. The world could still view 
him as a felon.

If Morant refused the deal, he would have to 
argue his case in court, just as Lewis had. But the 
odds weren’t in his favor. Although Lewis had won 
his case, Morant was not guaranteed the same 
verdict. Morant’s attorney advised him not to risk 
court proceedings, citing the years of litigation 
ahead. He told Morant that all of that legal work 
could take him a year or more. Coupled with the 
justice system’s slow-moving bureaucracy, even if 
Morant were to win his case on appeal, he would 
risk being incarcerated for two or more additional 
years.

Morant, who had missed watching his children 
grow up and had learned that his little brother 
and his father had passed away by word of mouth, 
wanted to go home. He wanted to hold Kim, his 
childhood sweetheart who visited him every week, 
and his sons in his arms without being scolded by 
corrections officers. He wanted to do mundane 
things, like go fishing on the weekend, cook steaks 
in his backyard, or wear a belt. In twenty-one years 
of incarceration, Stefon was never once allowed 
to wear a belt. “I didn’t feel like a man, without a 
belt,” he later told me. “Imagine what that’s like.”

On June 17, 2015, Stefon Morant took the deal. 
He would no longer be able to file a civil suit for 
compensation or clear his name. But he was ready 
to come home.
“I had no understanding” of the legal 
consequences, he said. “I just wanted out of that 
cage.”

The very same day, Kim rushed from New Haven 
to Cheshire, Connecticut, to pick him up. Just as 
she arrived, Morant realized he had no clothes 
other than his orange jumpsuit, so he asked a few 
corrections officers to let him borrow some jeans 
and a t-shirt. The borrowed clothes were too big 
for Morant. Without a belt, he pulled up his pants 
as best he could, ran out the doors of Cheshire, 
and jumped into Kim’s Jeep wrangler.
 “Start driving!” he remembers yelling, and Kim 
hit the gas. 
 “You didn’t even hug me,” he remembers Kim 
saying.
“I’ll hug you when we get the hell out of here. 
It’s not real until then.”
“So, did you end up hugging her?” I ask, four 
years later, in a café in downtown New Haven. 
Morant chuckles, and takes a bite of his salmon 
sandwich.
“I hugged her after she bought me that belt,” he 
said. “That’s when it felt real.”


“I see these cases all the time,” Darcy McGraw, 
director of the Connecticut Innocence Project 
told me. “People want to go home, and the justice 
system hasn’t been fair to them in the past. Why 
would they want to take the risk?”  
Some wrongfully convicted people, like Morant, 
accept a “time served” deal. Others choose to 
accept an Alford plea, a loophole that allows 
defendants to insist that they are innocent in 
court records, while still legally pleading guilty to 
receive shorter sentences. Both legal mechanisms 
operate similarly. Want to go home? Take the deal.

Some like to imagine that “time served” deals 
and Alford pleas are a win-win. Prosecutors 
maintain a successful record, while innocent 
people are guaranteed shorter sentences rather 
than rolling the dice with a criminal justice system 
that has already failed them. And because these 
individuals cannot sue the state in civil court 
for wrongful incarceration, the state can avoid 
expensive lawsuits, some of which end in million-
dollar settlements.

But these deals can have serious consequences. 
They leave wrongfully convicted people with 
criminal records, which can limit people’s access 
to public assistance: three states still ban felons 
from accessing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program benefits. In thirteen states, having a 
record can strip a person of their voting rights. 
But McGraw told me that the most serious burden 
involves employment. “In every one of these cases 
that I’ve seen, people just want to find a job,” she 
said, “and it’s harder to get hired when you have 
that record.”

When Morant got home, he spent two days with 
his family before feeling restless. He had gotten 
used to his regimented day at Cheshire: his days 
used to begin at 7 a.m. with breakfast. He would 
then go to work (he made license plates from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m.), the gym, dinner, his Bible study 
courses, and finally, bed. Now that he was home, 
he needed something to do.

He paid a visit to New Haven Works, a nonprofit 
downtown that helped him assemble a resume. 
Over the next two months, Morant applied to over 
fifty jobs. After weeks, the letters started coming 
in. The supervisor at Amazon’s Connecticut 
manufacturing plant wanted to know why Morant 
had not disclosed his felony on the application. 
“But the question on the application asked, 
‘Have you ever been incarcerated for a crime you 
committed?’” he explains to me. “I didn’t lie. I 
wasn’t [in prison] because I committed a crime. I 
was there because they were holding me captive. 
I was in a cage.” Morant didn’t get the job at the 
manufacturing plant. And by the end of the year, he 
had been denied trucking, sweeping, landscaping, 
and construction jobs. 
Finally—in early 2016—Morant got an offer for 
a refuse collector position, a stable job working for
