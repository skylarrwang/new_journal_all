To create a close-knit brotherhood, one Latino 
fraternity cuts off ties to the larger Yale community. 
I
t was about 2 am four years ago when Angel Falcon (ES '99) 
threw open his door and stormed into his freshman suite. He 
hurled his keys angrily against the wall and cried out. This was a 
surprising reaction from the even-tempered Falcon, a cry of 
anguish tearing into the cold serenity of yet another dreary February 
night. Angel's roommate found him lying face down on the bed. The 
letters on the back of Falcon's yellow hooded sweatshirt read 
"Caballero." Caballero Falcon was crying. 

The process of pledging Lambda Upsilon Lambda (LUL), Yale's 
Latino fraternity, had taken its toll on Falcon. He was the kind of 
freshman who, at parties, spent half the time introducing people and 
telling jokes, and the other half flaunting his salsa moves with his 
newest Latina. He rapidly earned a reputation as a merciless seducer, 
vowing at one point to "cure sexual frustration at Yale, one case at a 
time." Hew~ a headstrong and articulate player. Now, after a month 
in uniform, under LUI:s vow of public silence, his roommate found 
him disconsolate and broken. 

"That's the toughest night to talk about, it was psychological," he 
says, avoiding specifics. "Sometimes you think that you are really close 
to finishing this goal, but you are surprised that you are not even 
remotely close ... They cut us down bad." The physical and mental toll 
of pledging, or being "on line" as they call it, had similarly affected 
Falcon's two line brothers, and one Caballero had already dropped out. 
Several weeks later, Falcon would finally "cross" and become a brother, 
an Hermano. 

For each Caballero, in one way or another, pledging the nationally-
affiliated LUL is the most arduous ordeal he's ever faced. During the 
process that can last upwards of eight weeks, the line of Caballeros 
wears only white shirts, army pants, brown neckties, beige jackets and 
gold and brown armbands. At night they add hooded sweatshirts. 
While they may participate in class discussions, outside of the 
classroom and their own rooms, they are not permitted to speak with 
anyone but each other. Alcohol and drugs are strictly prohibited. Meals 
should be short. Mandatory study hours--long. Instructed to walk 
head down from class to class, Caballeros cut right angles when they 
turn. On official pledge evenings, the line studies Latino culture, 
exchanges personal histories, or endures challenging jogging and 
calisthenics workouts. Pledging Lambda becomes a Caballero's life. 

Cast among its fellow fraternities on campus, LUL bears little 
resemblance to the larger, less structured, more public Greek 
organizations. When seen marching on a path in tight formation, a 
Caballero line seems more like a centipede on a rainforest twig than a 
pack of white-hatted frat boys taking their leave from Lake Place. The 
FEBRUARY 12, 1999 
decision not to host late nights and four-keggers has been well 
thought-out. LUL is a fraternity that demands not only psychological 
discipline, but nearly an entire semester of rigorous commitment. 

It's a lot to ask of a wide-eyed freshman, bombarded daily with 
Yale's possibilities. "As a frosh, faced with all these new opportunities, 
all these decisions on what to join, I know it seems contradictory," 
Hermano Manuel Berrelez (DC '00), LUL's president, ad mits. 

"Wouldn't the last thing you'd want to do as a frosh be to alienate 
yourself from the rest of your class?" 

Perhaps that is why, from an undergraduate population of 
approximately 160 Latino men, LUL culls only a handful for each 
pledge class. Lambda stakes an extremist position on a constant 
dilemma facing minority organizations: whether to publicize 
themselves and reach out to Yale, or to encourage self-reliance and risk 
estrangement from the rest of the university. And even within the 
Latino community, LUI:s stance is one of careful selectivity. By making 
it so arduous to join, LUL aims to attract only those fully dedicated to 
the process of becoming an Hermano.

For Camar Graves (BK '01) the opportunity to focus on his roots f 
was instrumental in his decision to pledge last year. To him, going 
~ 
through the process was a test of ethnic loyalty. "It's like, how badly do 
you really want to help your people?" 

As president, Berrelez knows that if he wanted, he could create the 
standard shmooze and booze atmosphere of the fraternity meat-
market. "I'm convinced that if we were to rent out Naples, get pizza 
and beer, we'd have at least 25 Latinos show up," he says 

L
atino students bring with them a variety of ethnic experiences 
through Phelps Gate as freshmen. Some grew up in Hispanic 
neighborhoods, raised on a diet of tortillas, merengue and the 
Catholic Church, and found themselves as one of few Latinos in their 
Advanced Placement classes. Afrer playing the daily role of token 
Minority Success Story in their high schools, they would come home 
to Latino neighborhoods and do their homework amidst a Burry of 
Spanish. Now, after earning a place in the Yale freshman class, they're 
once again living in the ethnic climate of that AP class, only now on a 
much grander scale. "I never felt like a rnino,rity before," Hermano 
Frederico Blanco (BK '00) said. "It's something to come to grips with." 

Wendy Montoya (BR '0 1), shares the experience. "I was used to being 
in a mdting pot of people," she says of her adolescence in Houston. 
"Now I get all these emails just because I'm a minority." 

On the other end of the scale are Latinos who have long known 
the wodd of the demographic margin, arriving at Yale from affiuent,
