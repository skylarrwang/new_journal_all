exclaimed that the father-daughter dance was 
the "first time I held my baby in my arms." 
Needless to say, such reunions are far less 
common at tr.rdicional debutante balls. 
Turner congratulates herself when she 
speaks about the grandeur of the final ball. 
"It's a pretty hotsy-totsy affair," she says, 
describing the dresses and the decorations. 
She boasts that this year it will take place at 
the Omni Hotel, so that, according to 
Turner, the participants who don't have a car 
will be able to take the bus. As with all 
elements of the program, the committee 
stipulates that the event must take place in an 
area accessible by foot or public 
tranSportation. 

The grandeur of the ball is not the end of 
the line for the Debutantes of Christ. 
Emboldened by career counseling, etiquette 
lessons, and a recognition of their self-worth, 
they crusade toward job security and 
suburban comfort. "It's not just because of 
our program," Turner continues, "but our 
girls go on to become doctors, lawyers, 
Indian chiefs, you name it." She rattles off 
names and accompanying occupations as 
proof of the success of the program: lawyers 
who live in. Westport, elementary school 
teachers who live in West Haven-
emphasizing, of course, the importance of 
friendships made along the way. 

Operating as an educational, community 
uplift organization, the Debutantes for Christ 
Committee seeks to eliminate the 
socioeconomic barriers its young participants 
face. The final ball, to be held on February 
26, is a universe away from what debutante 
balls symbolized in the past. It is not a 
showcase of wealth and bloodlines, but rather 
a presentation of merit and ambition, even if 
its terminology remains rooted in the 
nineteenth century. 

Through the receiver, I can hear T umer's 
dinner sizzle in front of her. In the basement 
office of the church, a volunteer uses 
Windows 98 to update a pledge drive 
database. It is strange to imagine someone in 
this environment wanting to harken back to a 
day when debutantes meant something. It is 
stranger to think that someone would see in 
that word a vehicle to promote not just self-
esteem, but self-actualization.
