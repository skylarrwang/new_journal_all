**New Haven's Sushi Chefs**
**Author: Jada Yuan**
**Page number(s): 40-41**

a failing Italian restaurant cheap enough for 
them to buy in New Haven. Since Hama's 
opening 14 years ago, the restaurant has 
doubled in s~e and has quadrupled its 
number of sushi chefs (for seven years it 
operated with only Moto at the bar). The 
restaurant prides itself on "tasty and beautiful 
sushi made quickly," and most of its creative 
sushi options, such as the red, yellow, pink, 
and green Rainbow roll are Moto's own 
invention. 

New Haven, with its large university 
population of what Moto calls "sushi people," 
has opened up opportunities for many other 
chefs besides Haya and Hama. Mei Yao and 
Miao Yu, two part-owners of the Asian 
House Restaurant, have capitalized on the 
student population's willingness for 
experimentation and taste for ethnic foods. 
Their restaurant features Chinese, Thai, and 
Japanese selections, but all three of their chefs 
are Chinese. After immigrating to New York 
from Shanxi, China, Miao Yu trained for 
only two months before stepping behind the 
bar at Asian House. "We just know the 
simple way, not deep," Mei says, but the glut 
of experimental and ignorant restaurant-goers 
doesn't seem to notice. "American person 
comes in and knows just a few words of 
Japanese, but they talk to her," Mei laughs. 
"Chinese and Japanese person is just a face. 
They look the same." 

G
eorge Oakley, one ofMiya's star sushi 
chefs, looks nothing like any other 
chef in the New Haven area. The 
California-born surfer and wrestler is not 
only muscular and young, he's also black. 
Oakley, who spent most of his life working in 
his parents' two 7-11 stores, never guessed 
that he would end up working as a sushi chef 
in New Haven. Two years ago, when he 
decided to come to Southern Connecticut 
State University to complete his degree in 
sociology and communications, his only 
consideration had been the school's wrestling 
program. When his wrestling career ended a 
year and a half ago, Oakley started hanging 
out at Miya's in downtown New Haven. He 
knew Bun Lai, a former wrestler, through 
other wrestling buddies, and liked to go to 
the restaurant several times a week for 
Sapporo beer and sake. One day, a couple of 
months later, Lai offered Oakley a job. "He 
was like, 'Throw this on,' and he handed me 
an apron," Oakley says. "fm very inquisitive. 
FEBRUARY 12, 1999 
He saw that I kept asking about sushi and it 
just sort of blew up. So here I am, chopping 
away." 

The training regiment at Miya's took 
about five months of learning the basics 
known to sushi chefs everywhere: how to 
cook rice, how to cut fish and how to make 
rolls. Lai supervised Oakley and taught him 
all he knew. "It's a progression," Oakley says. 
"As you progress you get to be on your own 
more and more until they want to see how 
you react under pressure and they throw you 
to the wolves." After a year and a half of work 
at Miya's, Oakley now joins Lai in creating 
new options for the menu and making other 
decisions for the restaurant. Oakley grins 
rnischieviously, "I put the soul in the roll." 

New Haven and its population of "sushi 
people" has room for all creative sushi artists 
within its boundaries. "If interested in sushi, 
anyone can be sushi chef," says Moto, who 
employs one Japanese-American and two 
Mexicans at his bar. Sam Oh, a Korean 
immigrant whose Seoul Restaurant in 
downtown New Haven features both Korean 
and Japanese specialties, asserts that race has 
much less to do with making great sushi than 
determination and sensitivity. "It's like a 
heart," he motions towards his chest. "If 
mind goes too fast, rice grows too hard. You 
have to take care of the rice, the knife, the 
fish. You have to touch fish very softly." 

Patrons at any of New Haven's sushi 
restaurants have to get used to the lack of 
Japanese sushi chefs in the area. "I get 
second-guessed all the time," Oakley says. 
"It's up to me to show my talents, show what 
I can do." But Oakley isn't worried. He 
knows his rice, fish, and seaweed as well as 
any other chef in the area and has throngs of 
repeat customers who find his rolls the most 
soulful in the city. Oakley won't stay at Miya's 
forever, though. He'll finish school in a year 
and still has to thi.nk about graduate school. 
For him, sushi is less of a career than another 
notch in his cooking belt. "Now," Oakley 
says as he presses a bed of rice into a thin 
piece of seaweed, "I have something to add to 
my appetizer list."
