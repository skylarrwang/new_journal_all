Is there an American city (other than Detroit, perhaps) so synonymous 
with urban decay as Buffalo? There it sits in the left armpit formed by 
Canada's border with New Yt>rk. It gets the meanest moufalls east of the 
Rockies. It's home to the losing-est Super Bowl contmdm in history. And as 
anyone who's driven through it en route to happier places will attest, it 
looks bad.

The New Haven Advocate, july 4, 1998 

I
s there an American city (other than Detroit, perhaps) so easy to 
rag on as Buffalo? Is there any town that inspires as much disdain, 
even revulsion? Vincent Gallo's film Buffalo '66-which provided 
the springboard for Boonstra's terse meditation on geography, 
misery, and football-made disgust its central theme: disgust for 
oneself, for one's surroundings, for one's parents and origins, and 
foremost for Scott Norwood. Norwood, as Western New Yorkers know 
all too well, was the Buffalo Bills player whose botched field-goal 
attempt at the close of the 1991 Super Bowl has become a crystallizing 
moment of defeat in the city's collective memory, an undying symbol 
of Buffalo's fundamental haplessness. Historically, the Queen City-
where I spent my first 18 years--has suffered a long decline: it slowly 
sank from a focal point of westward expansion in the nineteenth 
century as the hub of the Erie Canal, to a bustling but financially 
troubled metropolis in the 1960s, to the dilapidated, rather desolate 
town it is today. The closing of the steel mills and "white Bight" in the 
1970s delivered sound blows to Buffalo's self-image (and population 
density), but somehow Norwood's folly was a point of no return. The 
moment that ball careened just right of the goalpost was the moment 
that proved what Buffalonians had feared all along: that we were 
destined, in all things, to fail. 

The kicker, so to speak, was that this premonition was confirmed 
in front of the entire country; we were anointed as the official 
whipping boy of the U.SA., much like Newfoundland is for our 
neighbors to the north. We wear our dunce-cap crown with cheerful 
defensiveness, trying to turn our national shame into a position of 
strength. And-1 suppose because we're true to ourselves--we fail. Jay 
Leno establishes a nightly monologue motif by which he compares the 
height of Buffilo's snowdrifts with that of diminutive Bills quarterback 
and Flutie Flakes purveyor Doug Flutie (family lore has it that my 
cousin Mary Beth flirted with him in a bar once), and we'll reply with 
chirpy pluck that winter in Buffilo is the best seven months of the 
LocaL FLavor 
year. Make geography-as-destiny jokes like "America's Armpit" or "The 
Mistake on the Lake" (a tide which Erie, PA and Cleveland also 
proudly claim), and we'll remind you of our mercifully close proximity 
to Toronto, where we buy up Roots sweatshirts in bulk and where any 
disaffected teenager with access to a car spends as much time as possiblt. 

Say you're Don lmus. You go to Buffilo for a speaking engagement (in 
the hilly Southtowns, no less, which is as close to pastoral as the Buff 
comes). Your subsequent report to millions of listeners about the trip 
carries a whiff of the tragic, conflating pity, terror, and a certain 
reverent abhorrence in just five words: "God, what a dreadful place." 

We might be a little flummoxed, but we've got plenty of comebacks in 
our town-pride holster: Mark Twain lived here for a little while. Hey. 
at least we 71lfllk it to four consecutive Super Bowls. We've got, urn, the 
Goo Goo Dolls. We've got a Frank Lloyd Wright house. And 
goddamrnit, we've got wing.r. 

Maybe Buffalo should turn that preeminent claim to fame-
recently celebrated here in the Elm City, at the Seventh Annual Wwg 
Ding in the New Haven Coli5eum-into a hokey-inspirational motto, 
like how Clinton's people are always saying be's the Man from Hopc-
"We believe we can fly," or something. The problem, obviously, is that 
the same disingenuity is inherent in both catchphrases. The
