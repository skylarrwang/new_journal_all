Levin (GRD 74) and the YDN. According to 
Florence, their argument ran something like 
this: "Jews had been historically discriminated 
against, especially in faculty hiring at Yale. 
Because of that, we had a heightened 
sensitivity or awareness to discrimination in 
faculty hiring." Indeed, the letter drew 
heavily from the history of anti-Jewish 
discrimination in hiring at Yale and was filled 
with parenthetical citations to Dan Oren's 
(MC '79) definitive history of the subject, 
joining th~ Club: A History of]ws and Yak. 
While the activists' presentation drew 
hostile criticism from a few of Hillel's more 
conservative members like Isaac Meyers (BR 
'0 1), who characterized their letter as "long 
and angry," it also failed to win over the vital 
center of liberal-minded but cautious 
students. Yale's closed tenure deliberations 
forced Minkin and Weise to rely solely on 
statistical and anecdotal evidence of 
institutionalized discrimination. While the 
evidence did have a certain power, most 
students wanted to hear administrators 
present a defense. "No one said, 'perhaps 
these statistics could be explained by a, b, and 
c.,"' Florence recalled, explaining students' 
reluctance to take decisive action as gauged 
by comments made at the meeting and a 
series of votes taken on potential responses. 
Rather than sending the original letter, the 
Student Board drafred a new letter, inviting 
President Levin to present the administrative 
position at a Hillel tea. {Levin accepted the 
invitation on the condition that he would not 
exclusively discuss tenure, but would 
comment on a range of issues.) 
But the core of the problem went deeper. 
Why was a committee of students specifically 
created to take a left-of-center stance on 
tobacco investments balking at supporting 
tenure reform? In their original letter and 
presentation, Minkin and Weise hoped to use 
Jewish history at Yale to impel their 
community to take action. In doing so, they 
took a page from Friedrich Niet7.sche's 
philosophy of history-only when certain 
historical facts are selected and strung 
together to tell a particular story can they 
spur people to take a stand. But while the 
activists' letter highlighted historical 
similarities, their audience could not help but 
think of differences. Newly-elected Student 
Co-coordinator Sophie Oberfield (SY '01) 
summed this objection up well. "The parallel 
is a little problematic. It just isn't the same

thing. Jews were once kept out [officially)." 
But with respect to women and minorities, 
Oberfield said, "It's not a policy. The [anti-
Jewish] poli<:1was broken and now it's not an 
issue anymore, but this isn't a case where you 
can look at a policy and say, 'Hey, that's 
discriminatory, it's written.' It's a case of 
alleged discrimination that isn't in the rules 
but in the process. And that's a big 
difference." The activists realized their 
audience demanded a stronger parallel than 
they could provide. "They wanted evidence 
of overt discrimination, and I don't think 
there is overt discrimination. And I think we 
were in a position of having to argue that 
there was," Minkin said. 
Dan Oren, who now teaches psychiatry 
at the Yale Medical School, echoes Oberfield's 
remarks. "There is a world of difference 
between the 1990s and the 1920s, '30s, and 
As the story of Morris Sweetkind illustrates, 
matters rarely came to that. The Ivies 
generally nipped their potential Jewish 
problem in the bud. Denying qualified Jews 
spaces in their graduate schools ensured that 
universities would rarely have to deny a 
clearly qualified Jew a place on their faculties. 
In an age when an Ivy League PhD was a de 
facto requirement for an Ivy League faculty 
post, there were simply very few "qualified" 
Jews. While top graduate schools today have 
affirmative action programs in place, they still 
have low numbers of minority students, 
especially in certain areas. For example, in 
1995 blacks received only 1.5 percent of all 
PhDs conferred in the physical sciences. 
Surely there are no overt messages telling 
blacks not to do graduate work in these fields, 
but there may be tacit messages sent out by a 
still-prejudiced society. That unspoken cues

faculty and there is far more diversity. Is it a 
perfect diversity? Certainly not. But today, 
the community is very different. Much of the 
discrimination against Jews back in the '30s 
was a discrimination against people who were 
not part of the community and was born out 
of a disdain for Jews. I don't think that today 
one could make a credible case that there is 
significant disdain for women or minorities 
among the faculty because indeed there are 
many women and minorities who are among 
the faculty at this point. So it's not the same 
level of outsider versus insider situation that 
is was 70 years ago." 
Still, a case can be made that there are 
some legitimate parallels. Many of those who 
were skeptical of the analogy seemed to be 
under the false impression that, in the '20s 
and '30s, Jews kept coming up for tenure but 
were being kept out by anti-Semitic policies.

While it was the exception rather than 
the rule, even before World War II, Jews 
occasionally came up for tenure. Instead of 
appealing to overt anti-Semitic policies, 
opponents used code words to indirectly 
draw attention to the candidate's ethnic 
origins. According to Oren's book, Paul 
Weiss's faculry nemeses derided him as "a 
caricature of the all-knowing and pushy Jew," 
a man unfit for entrance into Yale's polite 
society. Oren writes, "As long as a Jew could 
not have been a 'gentleman,' he could not 
have been part of a society of gentleman 
scholars." Critics of the tenure process cite 
similar anecdotes in which they claim male 
members of tenure committees have opposed 
female candidates' tenure bids, claiming their
