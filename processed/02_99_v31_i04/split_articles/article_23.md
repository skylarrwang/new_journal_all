he says, explaining his acceptance of the 
suspension. He is attached to the club not for 
its sandwiches or couches, but for its 
members. "~'s a place of interesting and 
talented people with similar interests to 
mine," he says. In fact, North's behavior was a 
little too well~suited to the stated mission of 
the club: he handed out copies of his poems, 
and interrupted members' solitary reading to 
share details of his intellectual and personal 
life. "I was very self-absorbed at the time," 
North says of this psychologically difficult 
period. Another member observed, "The 
Lizzie is for polite conversation, simple 
conversation, to hear more than that got on 
people's nerves in numerous ways." 


By the time the Board of Governors met 
on April 14, 1998, some Governors had 
heard complaints that North was making the 
club an uncomfortable place. It was difficult 
to pin down concrete offenses-rather, 
members complained of unsolicited poems, 
inescapable monologues, and forays into 
uninvited, personal topics. They also 
complained that North had begun 
buttonholing them outside the club. One 
member recalls being put off when North 
called her at home to invite her to tea, leaving 
the number of the club on her answering 
machine. The club steward also remembered 
that North's conversation had begun to put a 
dent in her full schedule, though she speaks 
highly of him and says that in spite of his 
apparent mental illness, "I didn't find him 
threatening." 


Most of the complaints that seem to have 
troubled the Board members came from 
women who fdt threatened by the eccentric, 
gregarious older man. No one appears to have 
alleged sexual harassment, but many female 
members felt that North put them in 
uncomfortable situations-in a club 
dominated by decorum, they had to break off 
conversations and deny requests for telephone 
numbers. As one undergraduate woman put 
it, "He was a mentally unstable man. No 
young woman's going to feel comfortable in 
that situation." Other women say they felt no 
threat from North, but several did complain 
to the Board of Governors, according to 
members of the Board 


During his first month back at the club, 
North appears to have broken only the 
subtlest of the unwritten rules which control 
behavior in the Lizzie. Some members still

with him was. Raine recalled that although 
North was apparently fulfilling the mission of 
the club by vigorously pursuing intellectual 
discussion, "Many people just viscerally felt 
this was inappropriate." Yet, as Raine recalls, 
"It was so hard to distinguish what he was 
doing from what anyone else was doing."

S 
pring break came and went, the 
uncomfortable episodes became more 
frequent; the month of April saw what 
North now recalls as a few very difficult 
weeks. Kirk Swinehart (GRD '01), a member 
and graduate student in American Studies, 
remembers him as "a dazzling raconteur and 
poet of peculiar sensibility." He continues, 
"Now the Lizzie is nothing if not a place for 
raconteurs and poets, but he spoke a little too 
quickly and animatedly for comfort. It was 
clear from the first that something was not 
right, and no more so than when he forced 
his poems on you. Invariably, they were 
printed 10 an eerie, unsteady hand."

Swinehart says he accepted a copy of one 
poem, and some months later the author 
asked him to pay for it. 


By the time the Board met on May 5, 
North's awkward conversation and unwanted 
poems had given way to requests for money 
and what most saw as more open abuse of 
membership privileges. Several members 
noted that his dress had deteriorated, and 
that he was spending almost every possible 
moment in the club. They also noticed that 
he had begun to violate one of the club's 
many tacit rules, and was seen napping on 
the couches. "There are certain things in the 
Lizzie that you just don't do," Lilly Tuttle 
(PC '00) says. "It's different from crashing on 
a couch in Sterling Library-I would never 
feel comfortable sleeping on the couches at 
the Lizzie." 


The Lizzie is open to guests of members 
on Thursday through Sunday, and North 
would sometimes invite student Duff Monon 
(TC '00), a Religious Studies major whom he 
had met after his return to Yale. They made a 
conspicuous pair-the wiry, often disheveled 
student and the increasingly worn member-
often sitting together at the table in the 
center of the tea room, discussing personal 
and intellectual issues under the club's 
dominant decoration, a large portrait of 
Queen Elizabeth I. "Mr. North is one of the 
most articulate, talented people I have ever 
met in New Haven," Duff recalls; he also 
remembers that his friend once brought him 
on a members-only day, leading to an 
uncomfortable reprimand.

"I would stress the minomess of the incident 
and the appropriateness with which it was 
handled. I have good things to say about the 
club and the Board of Governors. I am 
certainly not disgrunded, and gossip seems to 
have blown things our of proportion." 


"In a way, he was the ultimate Lizzie 
person," Duff Morton says. And North 
appears to remain so, commenting 
appreciatively even on his suspension, "The 
committee was quite tactful." Like many 
members who refused interviews, he places a 
high value on discretion and propriety. Before 
politely showing me to the door of his long-
term residence to conclude our first brief 
meeting, he used the same words as Stephen 
Parks, who strongly objected to this story: 
'1t's entirely private club business."

he bathroom on the Lizzie's second 
floor .is furnished as it has been for 
decades. The ornate, low porcelain 
bowl has a wooden seat, and a red rug only 
partially conceals wooden floorboards. The 
wall behind the toilet is papered with a black 
and white print of pocket-watches, while the 
other walls are papered, also in black and 
white, with a jarringly campy set of quotes on 
the theme of time. 


With the passage of history neatly 
confined to the bathroom, the Elizabethan 
Club attempts to maintain its unchanging 
attachment to the serene Yale of a vaguely 
remembered past. If the suspended North 
keeps his use of the dub within its limits, and 
restrains his appetite for its refined society, he 
will probably get his key back. Yet as blue 
jeans appear more and more frequently, and 
as so many members admit that their primary 
interest is the free sandwiches, the club is 
gradually moving away from the old Yale that 
its conservative members so admire. The 
dose-knit social and literary society which 
Yonkers carpet maker Alexander Smith 
Cochran imagined in 1911, and which Allan 
North envisioned again in the spring of 
1998, no longer really exists, if indeed it ever 
did. If he is reinstated in March, North can 
stand with the rest of the Lizzie faithful in the 
losing battle to maintain a perfect, impossible 
history of Yale.
