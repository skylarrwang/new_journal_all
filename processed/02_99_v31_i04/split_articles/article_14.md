I did not expect to be admitted to Yale. 
!he. ide.a of enrolling at an Ivy League 
Institution was unreal to me, a senior 
attending high school in the Netherlands. 
Yale's name carried the connotation of elitism 
and isolation; only once I became a Yalie 
myself did I become aware of its diversity. 
"There has been an increasing diversity in 
the type of high schools applicants who 
attend," Dean of Undergraduate Admissions 
Richard Shaw says. "Yale now accepts 
students who have been home schooled." For 
the class of 2002, 53.3 percent went to public 
schools, 11.9 percent to boarding schools, 
18.6 percent to private day schools, and 8.7 
percent to parochial schools. In the last 
decade, there bas been an increase in students 
attending religious schools, coupled with a 
seven percent decline in public school 
students. "This trend is not a result of Yale's 
admission policy," Shaw says. "With the 
economic prosperity, more parents are 
sending their children to private schools, and 
there bas been an erosion of the yidd rate for 
students at public schools." In response, the 
University has increased recruiting at public 
schools and boosted financial aid, hoping to 
~ 
prevent a further drop in the number of .!T 
middle-class students. 

Justin Davids (ES '0 I) would never have l 
applied to Yale had he not received the "1 01 f 
reasons to go to Yale" pamphlet in the winter ~ 
of his junior year of high school. Attending 
Smithton R-6 High School, a rural public 
school in central Missouri, Davids never 
thought about going to college out of state, 
let alone a place like Yale. He became the first 
student to attend an Ivy League institution in 
his high school's 130-year history and the 
only one to go out of state in his graduating 
class. "Receiving Yale's information brochure 
was the first time I thQught about the idea of 
going to the Nonheast," he says. 

The first student in 16 years to come to 
Yale from the north Oregon coast, Becca 
Shaffer (ES '?I), _:ilio credits Yale's recruiting 
effort. Cons1dermg her high school's one 
Advanced Placement offering and less-than-
5 

rigorous curriculum, Shaffer viewed Yale as a 
dream school. Shaffer was extremely 
impressed that the Yale interviewer visited her 
house; for all her other college interviews she 
had to travel to Portland, an hour and a half 
away from her home. She was also moved by 
the phone call from the alumni coordinator 
on the day she received Yale's acceptance 
letter. "I was torn among Yale, Duke, and the 
University of Southern California, and Yale's 
efforts definitely affected my decision." 

"Many of the public schools that send 
students to Yale are magnet schools or schools 
with selective admissions," Shaw says. "Since 
the freshman class must have the common 
denominator of intelligence, we only accept 
people who are prepared to be academically 
challenged at Yale." This preparation is 
usually harder to achieve in schools with 
fewer resources, according to Shaw. This has 
not, however, discouraged Yale from 
admitting students who have o.utstanding 
records at high schools with poor resources: 
In 1967, Yale President Kingman 
Brewster wrote a letter to the Director of 
Admissions ending the favoritism towards 
private schools. The letter stated that there 
should not be "prejudgment by any 
generalized favor for particular family or 
school background." Three decades later, 
Dean Shaw keeps a copy of this letter on his 
desk.
