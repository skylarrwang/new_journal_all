moscly white neighborhoods or prep schools. 
Hermano Graves, for example, came from 
Greenwich, CT, and Hermano Wellington 
Veras (TO '99) from Choate. For them, 
claiming positions as minority standouts has 
become second nature. 

Here at Yale, Latinos from every 
background are brought together, from the 
suburbanites searching for an ethnic identity, 
to the kids straight from the barrio grappling 
with their new status. LUL hopes to imbue 
both with a renewed cultural pride-which 
may explain why LUL, whose letters also 
stand for La Unidad Latina, has so much 
solidarity to start with. Lambda prides itself 
on its cultural diversity, boasting first-
generation Dominicans from the Bronx, half-
Puerto Ricans from Queens, and Mexican-
Americans who know they're often 
considered too white to be Mexican and too 
Mexican to be white-a tenuous spot on the 
unspoken Chicanometer. 

Uniting its diverse constituency has long 
been a challenge for Yale's Latino community. 
"There's somewhat of an invisible line 
between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans," 
Montoya says. Seniors recall racial tensions 
from a few years ago between some of the 
Lambda brothers and individual Chicanos. 
"The dynamics were tense, hot," said 
Salvador Gallardo (DC '00), president of 
MeCHA, Yale's largest Chicano organization. 
"But right now, they get along." 

How strongly an ethnic organization can 
unify its members--and conversely how well 
that group can define itself in the context of 
its cultural surroundings-are important 
measures of its strength. For many, Greek 
letter organizations offer the right 
combination of internal camaraderie and 
campus presence. 

Since the 1906 founding of Alpha Phi 
Alpha at Cornell, a black fraternity whose 
alumni include Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Thurgood Marshall, the rise of ethnic Greek 
life has gone hand in hand with the progress 
of minorities in higher education. Although 
ethnic fraternities flourish at most schools 
with large frat populations, such as SUNY 
Albany or UCLA, it's on the grounds of 
historically black colleges such as Atlanta 
University or Norfolk State that the ethnic 
Greek system is an intrinsic part of campus 
culture. In these minority-turned-majority 
environments, when the pledges appear, or 
come "above ground," the campus crawls 
with black-clad Alphas, red-hooded Kappas, 
and arm-branded "Q-dogs," brothers from 
the legendarily brutal and secretive Omega 
Psi Phi. Thousands flock to the ethnic Greek 
step-shows, in which the rhythmic intensity 
of the dancing is matched only by the crowd's 
explosive reception. 

At Yale, while recruiting weekends, ethnic 
houses, and PROP (the minority freshman 
orientation program), have become mainstays 
of the official minority support system, a 
handful of black and Latino fraternities have 
come and gone with the enrollment tide. 
LUL first appeared at Yale in 1992. 
Historically, most ethnic frats have remained 
small-Lambda generally enjoys a line of 
under five Caballeros-and outside of the 
minority community, its events go almost 
entirely unnoticed. Lambda's fall Noche 
LUL creates

a promtnent 
public persona 
for itself-its process 
cries for attention 
through its 
very silence. 
Dorada, a publicized, elegant banquet 
featuring academic speakers and over 250 
guests from all around the country, drew no 
coverage from either campus newspaper. It's 
not that people don't notice the fraternity, it's 
that people just don't ask. 

It's 9:15 pm, and at the back of Cross 
Campus Library study hours drag on. 
Decked out in their shirt sleeves, ties and 
armbands, the Caballeros have the 
institutional sobriety of penitentiary 
bookworms. On one side of the table sit 
Caballeros Carlos Garcia (TO '0 l) and 
David Botero (BK '02). Facing them are their 
line brothers Matthew Ramon (DC '01) and 
Carlos Jimenez (MC '02). The group is 
flanked by Hermano Marcos Tuero (PC '01) 
and a few other Hermanos at a nearby desk. 
Time passes. Two girls come by to chat about 
Orgo. The Caballeros study. The girls giggle 
and the Hermanos explain. The girls leave. 
The Caballeros study. Problem sets give way 
to reading and then to labs. Study hours are 
five hours a night, five nights a week. 

Most Yalies don't know much about the 
Latino community. Many have never heard 
of DB (it's the nickname for Despierta 
Boricua-the Puerto Rican organization on 
campus) or of the Latino cultural house 
(actually there are two: La Casa Cultural Julia 
de Borgos and the Chicano Cultural Center). 
Yet the figure of the hooded pledge walking 
head down is easily recognizable. Lambda 
could very well hide its pledges away for eight 
weeks, but chooses not to. Instead, it creates a 
highly noticeable public persona for itself-its 
process cries for attention through its very 
silence. Nowhere is that silent broadcast 
louder than here, in CCL In this forum the 
pledges assert themselves as efficient, studious 
Caballeros-gentlemen. 

Silent gentlemen, that is. The verbal 
isolation, called "social probation," serves 
several purposes. "One has to do with 
symbolic historical connotations to us as 
Latinos, as a conquered, oppressed people," 
Hermano Berrelez explains. Along with this 
metaphorical quiet, social probation is a 
method of eliminating distractions, allowing 
the Caballeros to focus on nothing but 
academics and fraternity. 

With the line as their only support for 
several months, Caballeros turn their focus 
inward. "If you isolate yourself from everyone 
else, all you have is each other," Hermano 
Graves says. "You're trying to build a 
brotherhood and you're trying to share your 
lives, and your experiences and your hopes 
and your energy." The months of mutual 
solitude seal powerful bonds of friendship. 

Perhaps the best manifestation of the 
Hermanos' emphasis on brotherhood 
(Lambdas call one another Bro) are the 
Caballero armbands-each line designs its 
own insignias and wears them constantly. But 
the loyalty that develops is more permanent 
than ink on cloth. As they say on line, 
"Hermanos para Siempre." Brothers forever. 

The Hermano alumni community 
supports itself in a variety of ways. As in any 
network of connections, Hermanos report 
that unique opportunities seem to flutter 
through the window when the time is right. 
Hermano Falcon, for example, received an 
early morning phone call in November, got a 
tie and resume, and found himself at an 
interview for a lucrative job at Proctor & 
Gamble, although he had not even applied. 

For Hermano Graves, the Hermanos 
came as a godsend when academic trouble 
forced him to take a year off from school. 
"Guys were calling me from California," he 
says, shaking his head. "Everyone wanted to 
see that Camar got back to Yale." This brand 
of brotherhood, essential to leadership, is 
what the pledging process tries to foster. "We 
are teaching these men to lead," 
Hermano Tuero says. 

And lead they do. Jeffrey 
Vargas, chairman of the 
fraternity's national council, 
points 
to 
alumni 
fundraising efforts to raise 
money for victims of 
Hurricane Mitch which 
recently 
battered 
Central America and 
the Caribbean. In 
New Haven, Lambda brothers started 
AMIGO$, a mentoring program in New 
Haven classrooms. But in the minds of the 
Hermanos, these are mere gestures in 
comparison to the real community service 
that the fraternity offers-the creation of 
responsible Latino men. Several Hermanos 
have never met their own fathers-they know 
what's at stake in communities which suffer a 
lack of male role models. It seems the best 
gifts that Latinos at Yale can give to their 
communities are themselves. 

Lambda's strategy of open isolation takes 
the notion of self-empowerment to an 
in-your-face extreme. For a Caballero, 
Yale becomes nothing but an academic 
resource for months on end. Breaking away 
from the greater community, the line 
develops as a unit, without any interaction 
with Yale's larger social environment and all 
too often, without its support. 

The Yale community has, in the past, 
taken issue with the excesses of LUL's social 
probation, denouncing their method as 
standoffish and militant. Communities at a 
variety of schools with LUL chapters have 
criticized their use of evocative armbands. Yet 
it's their segregationist practices that bring the 
most ire. "Not even considering the uniform, 
the act of isolating yourself for so long is 
taken negatively by the community, both 
ethnic or not," MeCHA's Gallardo says. 

FEBRUARY 12, 1999

Michael Jimenez (DC '99), agrees. 
"Marching down like soldiers, in cadence, I 
definitely don't think it's healthy at all," he 
says. "But if those people want to do it, I 
respect it." 

While he commends the group for 
cooperating with the administration, Dean 
Edgar Letriz Nufiez, Yale's Puerto Rican 
Cultural Center Director, does not approve of 
the fraternity's pledging approach. A specialist 
in fraternity relations, Letriz Nufiez helped 
bar Lambda-style pledging during a previous 
stint at Union College, following similar 
precedents at dozens of Greek-heavy schools. 
"A pledge process that requires and imposes a 
period of silence I don't agree with," he says. 
"I consider that complete and outright 
hazing-along with alcohol infractions, 
violations of university regulations and 
physical abuse." Take any given group of 
fraternities, he maintains, and one will likely 
push the limits. 

Perhaps this was the case last spring, 
when police arrested Lambda president 
Antonio Magana (DC '98) and detained 15 
fraternity members for criminal trespass. 
Hermano Miguel Correa (ES '00) insists he 
and his brothers were "simply where we 
shouldn't have been." Yet the New Haven 
Register called the incident an initiation, 
raising the specter of hazing. 

In retrospect, though, the only lesson 
learned is that frat boys will, in the end, be 
frat boys. Like their fellow Greeks on Lake 
Place and High Street, Hermanos 
play a lot of Nintendo, hang out 
together, and try to avoid college 
stress. 

Investigation yields little 
evidence to suggest abuse. 
Simply put, becoming a 
Lambda man is difficult, 
but not painful or 
dangerous. And when 
viewed alongside the 
practices of other 
campus Greek organizations, their process 
seems refreshingly wholesome. LUL pushes 
its pledges not with excessive drinking but 
with running, marches and pushups. 

Caballeros are not forced to shame 
themselves in public but are dressed instead 
to command respect from all. For pledges, 
studying with their brothers means doing 
their homework or discussing Latino 
heritage, not poring over old test questions 
supplied by willing alumni. 

If library hours are the fraternity's 
statement to the university, then parties 
during the process are its way of sending a 
message to the Latino community. When 
Caballeros make an appearance at a fraternity 
party, heads turn. Music pulsing, the crowd 
parts as the line enters the room with their 
distinctive march, their "scroll." The 
Caballeros then stand in a close line before 
the crowd, and shout a fraternity chant. As 
the party resumes, and the crowd spreads into 
the spaces around them, the men stand on 
line, arms locked on each other, heads 
forward, faces as blank as a sheet of paper. 
The women ogle and taunt, the Hermanos 
keep watch proudly, and the temperature 
rises as the party goes into the night. 

Sweating through their shirts, ties, 
armbands, and jackets, their silence is their 
pride. "You're so amped!" Hermano Tuero 
says, recalling last year's parties. "You can't
