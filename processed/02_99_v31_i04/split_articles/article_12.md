Groucho Marx once said he would never join a club that would 
have someone like him for a member. While we scoff at those 
exclusive groups which confront us in our everyday (and not so 
everyday) lives, we cannot help but question ourselves and those 
groups of which we are so clearly not a part. And, once in this 
exclusive circle, we often try to-downplay the inherent exclusion in 
which we participate. How many times have you responded 
''Connecticut" when asked which school you attend? That vaunted 
goal of Yale-dom, one which we have all sought at one time or 
another, transforms from innocent over-achievement into its own 
brand of exclusivity. We become more conscious of it every day 
when we speak with friends from home or read the papers 
detailing how Mother Yale is not without her biases. But exclysivity 
is far from limited to groups. It permeates every tier of culture, 
from both above and below. 

Would you have picked up "The Inclusive Issue?" Most would 
have passed the cover off as one of any number of resident activist 
publications indicting the University for one of its many exclusive _ 
policies. What's alluring about inclusion? Certainly not much when 
it comes in the form of a magazine being distributed to thousands 
of students, all knowing that whatever exclusive exposes were 
formerly uncovered are now available to anyone willing to read 
about them. Upon seeing "Exclusive," we immediately imagine 
celebrity scandal sheets entertaining for their overt trashiness. 
Exclusivity is more exciting to read about. This issue of The New 
journal explores this sticky situation. We can say we hate 
exclusivity, but we say it with the certainty that we are still 
consciously and sometimes helplessly contributing to the very 
forces that propagate it.
