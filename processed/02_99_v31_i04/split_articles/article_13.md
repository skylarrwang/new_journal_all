To Die For 
J?eath be not proud, but it certainly can 
be h1p. And for the past two centuries, the 
hippest place in town co party in the afterlife 
has been the Grove Street Cemetery. 

The attraction, of course, is the exclusive 
crowd. Where else can you carouse six feet 
under with hipsters like Benjamin Silliman, 
Eli Whitney, Tunothy Dwight, Ezra Stiles, 
and the likes of Timothy Mix. What, you 
haven't heard of Timothy Mix? He's only the 
hottest OJ this side of the Housatonic. 

And let's not forget about the service. 
Anyone who's paid $4 for bottled water is 
sure to be impressed by the hand-excavated 
graves, a process chat takes about five hours of 
manual labor. As far as accommodations, you 
can rest assured that the ground six feet above 
you will be covered in quaint shrubbery and 
flanked by chirping birds year round, leaving 
no hint of the party below. 

With sucfi credentials, the Grove Street 
<?emetery is one of the most exclusive post-
life party grounds ever. The cover charge is 
$3,500 for a plot (more than four times any 
other local cemetery). And although the 
cemetery is still accepting members, only a 
few hundred out of about 15,000 spots are 
left. Be sure to book in advance: life-long 
customers say it's the only way to go. 

The hosts of this club to end all clubs are 
a husband and wife team, cemetery 
superintendent William Cameron, Jr. and 
assistant superintendent Joan Cameron. 
Gracefully aged, grayed at the edges and soft-
spoken, such a pair of guardians have an air 
of permanence and finality. They are like the 
dignified, benevolent chaperones who hang 
around to make sure nobody dances too close 
or spikes the punch. 

"We feel like we're caretakers of an 
o.utdoor museum," William says. "Isn't that 
nght, Joanie?" he asks. "That's right," she 
responds. 

"We never fight on the job," William 
continues. "We work as a team. We are like 
one person." Such romantic caretakers 
bespeak quite a pick-up scene below. 

Surprisingly, Grove Street wasn't always 
FÂ£BRUARY 12., 1999 
regarded as the swingingest place to be. It was 
initially created on the outskirts of town to 
accommodate the overflow crowds from the 
more popular burying site at the New Haven 
Green, in the center of town. 

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Green 
was where all the cool kids went to die and it 
filled up with astonishing speed. In less than 
two centuries, the number of bodies had 
increased so much that the graveyard crept 
across the Green. It had to be obscured from 
view with willows and other foliage much like 
the nondescript warehouse facades that mask 
many an NYC hotspot. 

Epidemics of yeUow fever in the 1790s 
li~e so many r~mors of beer-recycling: 
tamted the Greens popularity, though. When 
the death toll climbed above a hundred, 
citizens understandably got tired of looking at 
headstones and death all the time. Led by 
James Hillhouse, they banished the rest of the 
future dead to Grove Street, a new joint at 
the edge of town. Thus, Grove Street 
Cemetery started as the second-most 
exclusive burial place in New Haven. Grove 
Street was just the place you settled for when 
the Green was all sold out. 

But from these bumble beginnings, our 
familiar cemetery rose to its current position 
as the dopest graveyard in town. Both its 
location next to the prestigious Yale campus 
and its list of f.unous members contribute to 
its snobbish and exclusive feel. If, upon death, 
one is able to gain admittance, the high stone 
walls of Grove Street Cemetery provide a hip 
place to bump and grind after the grind of 
life is over.
