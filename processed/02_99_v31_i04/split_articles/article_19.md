"pushiness" makes them difficult to work 
with. "It's a code word for 'assertive woman,' 
what is considered unacceptable in a 
woman," according to Minkin. 

But anti-Semitic code words were not 
always personal; some were ostensibly 
academic, as TAC maintains may be the case 
today. Before the 1950s Yale's English 
department excluded Jews because the 
department felt Jews' lack of faith in the New 
Testament undermined their ability to 
understand the English literary tradition for 
which it is a canonical text. While today this 
appears an obvious rationalization of anti-
Semitism, might modern day hostility 
towards new forms of scholarship also mask 
prejudice? Members of the TAC think so. 

They cite an anecdote from a reform-friendly 
professor who recently served on a tenure 
committee reviewing a female candidate. 
According to TAC members, the professor 
told them she decided not to bring up the 
candidate's feminist · scholarship for fear of 
provoking a "gender backlash." But Paula 
Hyman, a tenured professor of American 
Jewish history since 1982 (fact check), adds a 
caveat, explaining that there is "a fallacy 
connected with the idea that people through 
their ethnicity or gender offer representation" 
of their particular group. Not everyone 
charting new academic territory is a woman 
or minority. Hyman gives the example of "a 
Jewish male in Religious Studies who was 
doing some pretty radical stuff. Before he 
[was up for] tenure, he wrote a book called 
God's Phallus-probably not the kind of 
book you should write btfort you get 
tenure-and a lot of people didn't think it 
was good or defensible scholarship." The 
candidate did not get tenure. 

Minkin recognizes that there are 
problems with drawing these parallels but 
insisted that the Jewish community ought to 
support tenure reform regardless. In fact, she 
presented a strong argument that btcaust the 
situations are different, different solutions-
like affirmative action-are needed. "The 
Jewish situation is different from other 
groups,'" she said. "Sometimes Uews assume] 
the comfortable political pose of 'Well, we're 
Jewish, we're different, so we didn't benefit 
from wpite privilege.' Not true, not fair. 
We've been 'white' in this country since at· 
least 1950 in terms of being allowed to move 
our to the suburbs while black people have 
had to stay in the urban centers." That the
