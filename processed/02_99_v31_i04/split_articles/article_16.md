As a result, the program attracts an 
eclectic student body, not just young 
businessmen on their way to Wall Street or 
Corporate ~erica. Raised and educated in 
Italy, Annachiara Marcandalli (SOM '00) 
aspires to "go back to Italy and make a 
difference." With the recent introduction of 
the Euro, she explains, the Italian 
government will contract public spending, 
translating 
into 
splendid 
growth 
opportunities for Italian non-profits. She 
plans to return to Italy as a consultant to help 
establish corporate community partnerships. 
Other students with non-traditional goals 
include Allison Weaver (SOM '99), who will 
head into museum management, and Matt 
Larsen (SOM '99), who is honing his skills 
for the Edison Project, a private company 
which manages public schools around the 
country. 

But diversity does not stop at students' 
future goals. Not only are 30 percent of SOM 
students from abroad, but the school boasts a 
wide variety of vocational backgrounds-a 
whopping 33 percent of the students have 
worked at non-profit organizations-much 
more than at most business schools. "A real 
asset of Yale SOMis the diverse student body 
with different backgrounds, different world 
views and relatively broad definitions of what 
success is," Weaver says. 

School officials give a variety of reasons 
for the switch to an MBA this year: it will 
attract more students, help with job 
recruitment and address the requests of many 
Students and alumni. For the next three years, 
both degrees will be offered, but after three 
years, SOM will only offer an MBA Alumni 
will be able to swap their MPPMs for MBAs. 
In the business world, names matter. 
Nearly all the members of the class of 1999 
are opting for an MBA. "It is hard enough 
trying to explain in Italy what an MBA is," 
Marcandalli says. "I can't imagine what it 
would be like trying to explain to people 
what an MPPM is." Recruiters sometimes 
view the MPPM as a second-class business 
degree, not for what it truly is: "an MBA 
plus." 

Although applications for SOM won't all 
be in until March, Director of Admissions 
Richard Silverman says his office has hit the 
jackpot. "We are, so far, receiving more 
applications than last year, and we might even 
hit a record high for the school, but this was 
not unexpected," he says. "Our predictions of 
FEBRUARY 12, 1999 
an increase have proved to be just about on 
target." 

The change to an MBA will open up new 
doors for its students, at heart the school will 
still remain one step ahead in its unique 
focus. And a new degree name and an 
admissions explosion are just the beginning 
of what could be an SOM renaissance.

**Title: Drop Out, Perk Up**
**Author: Krya Kammnz**

Borsodi's is a secret. The shotgun cottage 
in uptown New Orleans, across from a 
cemetery and an elementary school, bears no 
identifying sign, only a string of Christmas 
lights. Yet anyone who finds the coffeehouse 
is welcomed as an old friend. 

A man and woman in plaid flannel and 
paint-spattered jeans, with long, shaggy gray 
hair emerge from behind the creaking door 
and envelop my friend Colin with hugs and 
exclamations. Robert Borsodi kindly asks, 
"What do you do? Are you in school?" when 
Colin introduces me to him. "Oh no," I 
thought, "time to reveal myself as a member 
of the establishment." 

"Urn, I'm at Yale University? In 
Connecticut?" 

"Oh, yeah. I was there, too. What would 
you kids like to drink? Marie, I think we're 
out of whipped cream." 

This cavelike room was the last place I 
had expected to run into a son of Eli. Every 
surface is plastered with posters, flyers dating 
back to Borsodi's founding in 1978, crayon 
drawings, postcards sent from all over the 
world, handwritten quotes from Nietzsche, 
Nabokov, Paul Klee and the Grateful Dead, 
and tapestries made of old Mardi Gras 
costumes. A 50 year-old Milanese cappuccino 
maker chugs and steams like a locomotive 
behind the bar. A white dove sits in a cage. A 
fireplace faces the bar, its mantlepiece heaped 
with stones, shells, botclecaps, and feathers. 

The reader may be moved to sneer at the 
hippie trappings I've described. There were 
lots of beads and braids in the room, and 
people were trading stories about pilgrimages 
to a Rainbow Gathering. Colin and I order 
rwo Cafes Herbabuena, which is Spanish for 
mint. Borsodi begins to make them with 
astonishing deliberation. I ask him if he liked 
Yale. 

"It was all right. I used to hitchhike into 
New York City every Friday afternoon, and 
back on Sunday." He adds extract of mint to 
our cups of coffee with a chemist's 
eyedropper. 

"Oh. Well, there's a really cheap train 
now, only 12 dollars one way," I counter. 

He looks at me, amused. "Believe it or 
not, I didn't always have 12 dollars. 
Sometimes I didn't even have a couple of 
quarters for the subway, and I would walk 
hundreds of blocks." 

"What did you do in the city?" 

"Went to shows, got around, talked to 
people. I didn't care for Yale particularly," he 
says. "My senior year, I started a coffee house 
on Whalley Avenue. That continued on for 
about three weeks, and I realized I couldn't 
do both. So I left school." He unscrews the 
top of an old peanut butter jar painted in 
purple glitter and starts to spoon green 
sprinkles on top of the fresh whipped cream. 

"But I learned the most at Yale from talking 
with the people there. The professors and 
students both. I learned far more in the :t 
dining halls than I ever did in class." 

I find Borsodi's words true-the highest 
ยง: 
privilege of a place in a club like Yale is the 
[ 
quality of its members. Coming from a man J 
who aetually chose the creation of meeting 
places over the material benefits of a Yale 
diploma, this sentiment sounds less cliched. 

Borsodi's business cards state his address 
(he has no phone) along with his mission: 
"There should be some common ground 
somewhere, after all~ where free spirits can 
gather and not seem peculiar or out-of-the-
way. Where any-and-everyone can share for 
the moment, at least, their common human 
experience among this welter of things here 
below." I wonder ifhe learned this at Yale.
