disappointment one feels upon the realization that Big Bill actually 
said "Mom and Pop's Floor Maintenance" and "Daddy-O's Auto 
grew up in a debauched, corruption-laden casino town would be no 
Parts." The women sported bad, crinkly perms and too-tight jeans and 
match for the expectations dashed by the disclosure that the wings in 
too much makeup. Everyone was overweight. Everyone talked through 
question for Buffalo are torn off slaughtered chickens (from Arkansas), 
their noses. Everyone was enjoying their Rolling Rock and buffalo 
plunged into boiling fat, cooked until they float, and served up to 
wings. Outside it was cold and dreary. The Coliseum looked like my 
hungry beer-swilling patrons, many of whom in their lumbering girth 
parents' bowling league. It looked, in short, like home. 

If New Haven can look and sound like Buffalo, then I would guess 
that a lot of America can. Maybe the perverse nationwide fixation 
upon Buffalo as an embodiment of pure abject humiliation is a 
reflection of what we all fear we have in common with the town, and a 
projection of it. A substantial number of us come from places, like 
Buffalo or New Haven, where there isn't much to do and the weather 
isn't so good and the people aren't so nice-looking. For a host of 
reasons, Buffalo has become the national microcosm--or 
scapegoat--of all these local frustrations and insecurities. 

And it's decided to be a gracious scapegoat. That's why 
Janice Okun can write without the crutch of irony 
about "intricate variations of chicken wing art," or 
why the Anchor Bar website boasts that past visitors to 
the pub have included "Spyro Gyra and Glenn Miller 
Band member Dick Gerhart." 

On my way back from the Wing Ding, I stopped 
into the other Anchor Bar, on College Street here in New 
Haven, to ask if they ever get confused with the buffalo-wing 
mecca. "Nah, that's never happened," barkeep Elaine replied, but my 
question did spark some secondhand memories of Buffalo. "I had a 
friend from Buffalo," Elaine told me. "His mother was basically 
illiterate and talked funny; it was really embarrassing. But he would go 
to the Anchor Bar there and the guys would just look at him like he 
was a god, because he'd gone to college and everything." This image of 
Buffalo's Anchor, in which the Cro-Mag patrons toss their bonesÂ· on 
the floor before approaching the ethereal M.A candidate in their midst 
with speechless apelike wonder, doesn't quite jive with my impression 
of the tavern as a stop for financial-district types and undergrads who 
like jaxz.. It does correspond, however, with a conveniently constructed 
narrative, one to which Leno and lmus and plenty of others have made 
notable contributions. Buffalo looks bad so that everybody else can 
look better. The Wing Ding was a reminder rrat a lot of us basically 
look the same. 

and hirsute aspect resemble the beast for which our proud city is 
named. 
Yet somehow I don't think most Buffalonians would recognize the 
irony as such, or mind it if they did. Take food critic Janice Okun, 
writing about buffalo-wing originator the Anchor Bar in the February 
3 edition of the Buffalo News: "The verb 'to Buffalo' something is now 
firmly ensconced in the culinary dictionary; it means to fry 
something (anything) and serve it with celery sticks and blue 
cheese sauce. So the responsibility of being chief chicken 
wing cook at the Anchor Bar is, well, awesome." In this 
passage, I'm struck by the refusal-informed by 
breathless civic pride-to admit that something 
unsavory tinges this exciting new entry into the 
gastronomic lexicon. I'm fascinated by the swift elision 
of any logical connection between a sentence about 
frying something (anything) and a sentence asserting the 
majestic perch of those fearsome deities who do the frying. 
These are the linguistic stamps of a dyed-in-the-wool-worn-seven-
months-of-the-year Buffalonian, for whom selective cultural myopia 
and a decidedly sanguine spirit of embellishment are one's best ways of 
rationalizing why, in God's name, you live in Buffalo. A native ability 
to fling animal parts into bubbling pots of lard is just one of your 
options. 

After I attended the Wmg Ding on February 4, however, I realized 
that maybe there isn't that much to rationalize; there are plenty of fine 
upstanding folks who don't have anything against animal parts, lard, or 
the Goo Goo Dolls for that matter. (The lineup of local bands 
providing the soundtrack for this gluttonous event included a plurality 
of sensitive emo-meets-Allmans types, all markedly Goo-Goolish.) 
Seven local bars and restaurants had set up shop around the perimeter 
of the Coliseum to hawk their varieties of buffalo wings, and as many 
tables serving soda, beer, and "wine" (I didn't ask) slaked our thirsts. 
The very first words I overheard once my friends and I pushed our way 
through the-1,000-strong crowd were those of a woman saying "Oh, 
wow, oh my God" --or, more precisely, "Oh, waaw, oh my gaaad." I 
knew that sound, that timbre--dusty and flat as the prairie where 
Buffalo roam. The men wore rattails and football jerseys and shirts that
