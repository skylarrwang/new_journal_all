Spie& Like U&? 
The CIA's current recruiting efforts indicate 
that its privileged relationship with Yale may 
be a thing of the past. 
I
f you've got a clean background, want to serve your country, and 
don't mind an occasional polygraph, there just might be a spot for 
you in the world of intelligence. The Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other members of 
the United States Intelligence Community are trying to rebuild for the 
next century. And part of that process is recruiting college students. 
But enticing the next generation of spies is not as easy as it once 
was. While in the past the mere letters CIA attracted students who 
were intrigued by its mystery, the Agency is losing its glamorous 
reputation. As more of the CIA's secrets are revealed-from the failed 
assassination of Fidel Castro to the treachery of Aldrich Ames-the 
CIA's ability to bring in new blood has suffered. "The CIA definitely 
doesn't have the respect it used to have," David Bookstaber (SY '99) 
says. "More and more I'm unconvinced that they even do anything 
valuable." 

Such sentiment, especially among students like Bookstaber, a 
seemingly ideal future intelligence officer, may explain the Intelligence 
Community's recent recruiting troubles. A vocal conservative,

ROTC scholarship. He is a patriotic American with technical skills, a 
liberal arts education, and military experience. The walls of his room 
are covered with pictures of the fighter jets he hopes to fly next year as 
an officer in the Air Force. But after applying for an internship with 
the NSA, Bookstaber does not see intelligence work in his future. 
"More than anything, the impression I got when I was applying was 
tedious," he says. "I'd rather be flying planes-not looking at maps, 
satellite images, or trying to pump the businessman down the street 
C) 
about what he's selling to the guy next door." 

Without the allure of espionage, intelligence organizations find 1 
themselves competing alongside investment banks and consulting f 
firms for the nation's top students. "In the past, the srudents were 
..., 
much more likely to come to us," Ken Acosta, a staffing officer at the 
~ 
NSA, says. Now, srudents can simply log on to the NSA website to 
find job descriptions, starting salaries, and application information. 
CIA advertisements in Th~ Economist, the N~w York Tim~s. and 
campus newspapers sit alongside those of Morgan Stanley and 
Andersen Consulting. Srudents now know that being an intelligence 
officer is not like a James Bond movie, so they have to be drawn in by 
more traditional means. "We've had to be 
creative," Acosta says. "It's a more difficult 
sell." 

In response to the challenge, the agencies 
are overhauling their image. These are the 
new and improved, friendlier spies. "We've 
become a lot more open in the way we do 
business," says Marie Vanderhoof, the Chief 
of College Relations in the CIA's new 
Recruitment Office. A visit to www.cia.gov 
gives a sense of the Agency's new approach. 
How could any college student tum down an 
Agency that offers the following benefits at its 
national headquarters in Langley, VA:. 
Employees can shop for an extensive 
array of quality personal and gift merchan-
dise; arrange for personal travel (air, train, 
ship}, vacation packages, and cruises; pur-
chase discount entertainment tickets: the-
aters, movies, sporting events, and theme 
parks; and utilize a handy one-day film pro-
cessing service, a dry cleaners and shoe 
repair service, and a unisex hair salon. 
"They try to talk up how nice the life is, 
how you only have to work 40 hours a week;" 
Bookstaber recalls from his NSA interviews. 
The NSA and CIA can advertise all the 
benefits they want, but the bottom line is 
salary. And that is exactly where they cannot 
compete. The best salary the NSA can offer a 
recruit just out of college is $41,000, which 
pales in comparison to most investment 
banking offers. 

Not that there has been a lack of 
applications; just last year, the CIA received 
over 25,000. But there has been a dearth of 
qualified applicants. Despite the increased 
information available about the Agency, the 
public is still generally unaware of the CIA's 
role. "A lot of people think that we're a law 
enforcement agency," Vanderhoof says. But 
until the CIA defines its role in the post-Cold 
War world, 
the 
Agency will 
be 
misunderstood. 

Although Bookstaber seems suited for 
covert operations-having recently turned 
21, he is working on his permit to carry a 
concealed weapon-he chose not to work at 
the NSA, opting instead for "a much better 
deal," a job at Microsoft. His internship at a 
large corporate fum sounds f.uniliar in today's 
Yale environment, where work in the public 
sector is not respected the way it was 50 years 
ago, when Yale and the CIA had a much 
closer relationship. 

T
he ties between Yale and the 
Intelligence Community trace back to 
a time more than 150 years before the 
CIA existed. Nathan Hale, American 
Revolutionary hero and the nation's first spy, 
spent his college days on Old Campus. His 
story now appears on the CIA Website for 
Kids: 
Armed with my Yale degree and under 
cover as a Dutch schoolmaster, I went 
behind British lines and proceeded to collect 
information. Other man my cover, I wasn't 
weU trained in me art of spying. I was cap-
tured by the British and hanged on SCptem-
ber22, 1776. 

One wonders why Hale, who was 21 at 
the time, went to war with a diploma instead 
of a concealed 
weapon; but 
his patriotic 
demise signals 
the beginning 
of a strong, 
connection 
between Yale 
and 
Intelligence 
Community. 

Yale's 
relationship 
with the CIA 
was 
unique 
even 
among 
the rest of the 
Ivy League, according to Yale History 
Professor Robin Winks' book Cloak and 
Gown. At Yale, the CIA could find students 
with travel experience, knowledge of foreign 
languages, and liberal arts educations. The 
strong history department also drew 
recruiters; analysis at the CIA focused more 
on human intelligence than on technology, so 
students with strong analytical research skills 
were most valued. 

But such qualities were found in students 
at other elite colleges. "Yale was not any 
better than Harvard," Wmks says. The key to 
Yale's influence was tradition. Once Yale 
alums took prominent roles in the 
development of the CIA, they guaranteed 
that Yale would have a significant role-Yalies 
tend to suppon their own. So more students 
were recruited from Yale, who in turn 
recruited more. At one point, even the Yale 
crew coach was on the CIA payroll to recruit 
potential operatives. 

In the 1960s, all this changed. Yale 
became a center of anti-Vietnam sentiment, 
and support for government organizations, 
especially mysterious ones like the CIA, 
plummeted. Other universities across the 
nation experienced the same phenomenon. 
In fact, according to Winks, Nixon wrote a 
memo instructing the CIA to stop recruiting 
at Ivy League schools and Stanford and stick 
to "patriotic" schools like Brigham Young and 
Notre Dame. 

According to political science professor 
H. Bradford Westerfidd, today's Yale faculty 
has a much different relationship with the 
CIA than when he first began teaching here 
in the 1950s. Then, it was common practice 
for professors to do consulting work for the 
Agency, and also to recommend students. 
"There 
were 
very 
few 
inhibitions 
faculty towards 
recommending 
students until 
the 1960s," he 
says. Now, he 
knows of no 
professors who 
actively recruit; 
a student would 
have to initiate 
process. 
And what about 
faculty members being consultants for the 
CIA? "It declined," Westerfield says, "but 
never ceased." 

P
olitics does not fully account for Yale's 
diminished role in the CIA. In the 
1980s, there was talk of a New 
Conservatism at Yale, but the university never 
regained its special affiliation with the 
Agency. As human intelligence became less 
important than technology, the Intelligence 
Community began to focus on schools with 
stronger engineering and computer science 
programs. Yale is better known for its history 
and English departments-no longer high 
priorities at the CIA. When the CIA visited 
campuses last fall, Yale did not make the list; 
Princeton did. 

Competition from non-Ivy schools also 
keeps recruiters away from New Haven. "We 
look at campuses that are wdcoming and we 
look for diversity," Vanderhoof says. When 
the CIA was content with being the white 
male institution that it is, Yale served as the 
perfect breeding ground for intelligence 
officers. But th~word of the day is diversity, 
and the CIA muSt listen to it. 

As the nation's intelligence coffers have 
been significantly depleted, the recruiting 
budget has been among the hardest hit. At 
one time the CIA could afford to visit as 
many schools as its recruiters could manage. 
"I currently do not even have a recruiter in 
the northeast," Vanderhoof explains. She has 
plans for hiring one by next fall, and maybe 
then Yale will re-enter the recruiting circuit. 

In the spring, the Recruiting Office will 
evaluate the past year's efforts. But even if 
they decide Yale is a school they want to 
target, money may still keep them away. After 
all, the Agency was in such financial straits 
that at the onset of the Gulf War no agent 
was stationed in Baghdad; they certainly 
cannot afford to recruit at every school. 

Budget problems affect recruiting indirectly 
as well. As politicians struggle to balance the 
federal budget, the CIA struggles to keep up 
with the private sector. The NSA now has to 
compete with the likes of IBM for the chance 
to offer appli~ts cutting-edge facilities. The 
Intelligence Community no longer holds the 
definitive lead in technology. 

Bookstaber's experience indicates another 
reason why the recruiters are having trouble. 
During the interview process, he was 
interrogated twice with a polygraph. In 
addition to suggesting an involvement with 
foreign nationals during his religious mission, 
his examiners accused him of drug abuse. 
"People who know me laugh at the thought 
of someone being so convinced that I have 
ever used drugs," he says with a laugh. 

But on the same day, according to 
Bookstaber, one applicant cried as the 
examiner pressed her for incriminating 
answers. "They were yelling at her, trying to 
get her to confess to something. So finally she 
confessed to copying software when she was 
15," he says, " and they laughed at her." 

Microsoft not only pays better, but they 
probably don't care if you stole a street sign in 
high school. It's no surprise that most 
students do not feel it's worth it just to be 
able to say, "I could tell you what I do, but 
then I'd have to kill you."
