the English language.

erhaps only a man with so 
formidable a name as Richard 
Chenevix 
Trench, 
dean 
of 
Winchester, could have proposed the 
concept of the Oxford English Dictionary 
(OED). On November 5, 1857, Guy Fawkes 
Day, Trench set forth the explosive idea that 
it was not the role nor the prerogative of a 
lexicographer to determine which words 
should be included in a dictionary. A 
dictionary should be a record of all words 
that enjoy a recognized life span in the 
language. 

But what is so revolutionary about an 
English dictionary that includes all English 
words? The English dictionary is a 
surprisingly young entity. Four hundred years 
ago there was no such volume. Consider the 
implications: William Shakespeare had no 
English dictionary at his disposal. Neither did 
Spenser, Marlowe, Jonson, or Donne. The 
first English dictionary appeared in 1604, 
written by a schoolmaster named Robert 
Cawdry and contained a scant 2,500 entries 
over 120 pages. Cawdry produced the work 
"for the benefit & help of Ladies, 
gentlewomen or any other unskillful persons, 
Whereby they may more easilie and better 
vnderstand many hard English wordes." This 
work set the tone for the many dictionaries 
churned out during the remainder of the 
17th century: a dictionary was a reference 
work that defined difficult words-words like 
abequita~, bulbulcitate, and commotrix. More 
general dictionaries began to appear in the 
18th century, culminating in the famous 
achievement of one of the greatest minds in 
the history of English literature: Dr. Johnson's 
A Dictionary of the English Language. 

Johnson's dictionary was a response to a 
demand, made most notably by Jonathan 
Swift, that the EnglishÂ· language be 
delineated, fiXed. Swift complained of the 
appearance in print of such unfitting English 
words as "bamboozle" and such linguistic 
tramgressions as "couldn't." Thus while 
Johnson's work was far more comprehensive 
than any of its ancestors, it was also haughtily 
prescriptivist in tone. Johnson edited the 
English language, including in his volume 
only those words he deemed appropriate. 
This haughtiness is charmingly apparent in 
the timbre of his definitions. Take, for 
example, his definition of oats as "a grain 
which in England is generally given to horses, 
but in Scotland supports the people." Or his 
entry for lexicographer: "a writer of 
dictionaries; a harmless drudge, that busies 
himself in tracing the original, and detailing 
the signification of words." An entry in 
Johnson's dictionary was still a membership 
in an exclusive club. 

Thus Trench's idea was utterly new: to 
write a dictionary that not only included 
every word in the English language, but also 
traced the history of each word's use in order 
to identify changes in meaning and sense. 
This was a tremendous undertaking. To put 
the work into perspective, consider that it 
took Johnson and his staff six years to write A 
Dictionary of the English Language while it 
took a succession of editors and a far greater 
staff over 70 years to produce the OED. 

For every word in the English language, a 
history had to be found, an etymological map 
created. This meant scouring every dark 
corner of English literature, from Beowulf to 
Dickens, for occurrences and variations of 
words. The most famous and influential 
editor of the OED, James Murray, enlisted 
the help of the English public in order to 
complete this chart of the language. Through 
one of his repeated appeals to English readers 
for help, Murray unwittingly found the 
assistance of Dr. William Chester Minor, 
former New Haven resident and graduate of 
Yale Medical School. 

But it was not in his family's New Haven 
home or in their crockery shop at 261 Chapel 
Street that Minor sifted through every book 
he could get his hands on, meticulously 
noting down citations for the OED. Rather, it 
was in Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally 
Insane, where he was incarcerated for life. 
Ironically, the Oxford English Dictionary 
could not have become a reality nor the end 
of lexical exclusivity achieved without the 
help of a man excluded from society, a man 
condemned for life to a lunatic asylum. 
Simon Winchester's The Profissor and tht 
Madman, recently nominated for a Critic's 
Circle Award, unravels the story of the man 
whose untiring work made possible the 
production of a project as audacious as the 
OED. 

Wmchester paints for his reader the life 
of a brilliant man trapped by unrelenting 
psychosis. After graduating from Yale, Minor 
began his medical career as a surgeon in the 
Union Army during the Civil War. Bur 
eventually Minor's psychological problems 
became too acute for him to perform his 
duties properly, and he was discharged from 
the Army. Believing a change of scenery 
might do him 9ood, Minor soon made his 
way to London. 

But his mental state did not improve with 
his change of nation. Indeed it worsened, and 
one night, in a characteristic fit of paranoia, 
Minor murdered a man in the streets of the 
Lambeth section of London. On his way to 
work, George Merrit was shot through the 
neck by Dr. Minor, who believed Merrit was 
trying to harm him. Merrie had unknowingly 
become a character in the world of Minor's 
delusions. A judge found Minor not guilty by 
reason of insanity, and Minor was 
subsequently committed. It was from his 
asylum that he penned what became nearly 
10,000 entries in the Oxford English 
Dictionary. 

Winchester has an intriguing story to tell, 
without a doubt, but his story is by no means 
impeccably told. Despite the remarkable 
nature of the making of the OED and 
William Chester Minor's integral role in it, 
Winchester at times betrays some insecurity 
about the quality of his story. He seems to 
want the story to be something it is not. In 
his preface, Winchester promises that "what 
follows is [a] strange, tragic, yet spiritually 
uplifting story." Strange and tragic yes, but 
Winchester forces "spiritually uplifting" 
where it does not belong. 

Winchester also does something very 
dangerous-he deceives his reader. He offers 
a romanticized version of the first meeting 
between Murray and Minor, in which the 
former is said not to have known of the 
latter's mental deficiencies until mistaking the 
asylum's warden for Minor: 

"And you sir, must be Dr. William 
Minor. At long last. I am most deeply hon-
oured to meet you." 

There was a pause. Then the other man 
replied: 

"I regret not, sir. I cannot lay claim to 
that distinction. I am the Superintendent of 
the Broadrnoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. 
Dr. Minor is an American, and he is one of 
our longest"staying inmateS. He committed 
a murder. He is quite insane." 

This dialogue is pure fiction, the creation 
of an English magazine writer in 1915 when 
the story first broke and nothing was known 
about the first meeting of editor Murray and 
concriburor Minor. Winchester, however, 
knows that Murray knew of the New Haven 
doctor's condition long before ever visiting 
Broadmoor. Yet he offers the myth first, in no 
way indicating co his reader that the story is 
wholly spurious. The author goes on to admit 
that this story is not true, and to deliver the 
details of the actual first meeting, but the 
reader inevitably feels let down. This feeling 
of deflation would not be so acute if the 
fictional account of the first meeting of the 
Professor and the Madman were not the one 
that the reader is made to anticipate 
throughout the narrative. The reader is left 
feeling like Winchester wishes that his story 
did end with the rather Gothic scene above. 

For example, he writes, "The patina applied 
by decades of good use has made the legend 
pleasingly credible." What kind of alchemy is 
Winchester asking his reader to accept? 

Not only does Wmchester ask his reader 
to believe a myth, but he also dwells on 
certain unfortunate facts. Regretting the 
sexuality that had plagued his actions and 
thoughts throughout his life, Dr. Minor 
performs a final act of surgery: the removal of 
his own penis, the source of his unsavory 
desires. While perhaps this detail deserves 
mention, since it demonstrates the 
development of Minor's condition, it is 
questionable that it deserves an entire chapter 
in the book (a chapter wincingly entitled 
"The Unkindest Cut"). Wmchester provides 
himself with an opportunity for some simply 
unfortunate passages in an otherwise well-
written work. The most egregious: 

The surgical removal of the penis is ar the 
best of times a dangerous practice, rardy 
performed even by doctors: An attack by the 
renowned Brazilian fishier known as can-
diru, which likes ro swim up a man's urine 
stream and lodge in the urethra with a ring 
of retrorse spines preventing irs removal, is 
one of the very rare circumstances in which 
doctor [sic] will perform the operation, 
known as a peotomy. It is a brave, fool-
hardy, and desperate man who will perform 
an autopeotomy, in which one removes 
one's own organ-the more so when me 
operation is done in an unsterile environ-
ment and with a pen knife. 

A brave, foolhardy, and desperate man 
indeed. 

Another unnecessary element to 
Winchester's work is his often aimless and 
unscientific speculation about the causes of 
Minor's psychological ailments. Early in the 
book Winchester attempts to demonstrate to 
the reader how Minor may have acquired the 
perverse sexuality of his later years during his 
childhood in Ceylon. Winchester's prose at 
this point becomes almost salacious: 

And there are the girls-young, choco-
late-skinned, ever giggling naked girls with 
sleek wet bodies, rosebud nipples, long hair, 
coltish legs, and scarlet and purple petals 
folded behind their ears-who play in the 
white Indian Ocean surf and who run, quite 
without shame, along me cool wet sands on 
their way back home. 

There are other problems as well, 
problems of form rather than content. 
Although the work is written in a very 
readable style, Winchester seems to have 
added to his personal lexicon while 
researching The Professor and the Madman. 
Abstruse words dot his prose, often sending 
Winchester's readers from the pages of the 
book to the pages of a dictionary, presumably 
for most readers something more abridged 
than the OED. Some of Winchester's gems: 
fusillade (to shoot down by volley or 
successive shot), tocsin (an alarm bell or 
warning signal), and purlieu (a resort). 

A thorough reporter, always quoting from 
primary sources, medical records and 
newspapers, Winchester often relates 
intriguing details in the history of Dr. Minor. 
William Chester Minor's contribution to the 
making of the OED cannot be overestimated. 
Although there were others like him during 
the 70 years of production to contribute 
prodigiously to the dictionary, no one ever 
matched Minor's precision and ability to 
always be one step ahead of the Oxford 
editors. Oddly enough, the individual who 
made all this possible, having brought the 
doctor the greater part of his library from 
which he culled his citations, was none other 
than Eliza Merrie. The wife of the man 
Minor gunned down, the cause of his 
exclusion from society, forgave the sick 
murderer of her husband and gave Minor the 
opportunity to put an end to lexical 
exclusivity.
