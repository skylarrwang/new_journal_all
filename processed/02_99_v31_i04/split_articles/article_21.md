THE NEW JouRNAL 

go to Yale. We iron "Y"s like gang-signs on the woolly 
sweaters we tie around our necks. We shop at the "Yale" 
Bookstore. We eat, no, we dine at Mory's. And what do 
we drink? Well, sure, we drink beer. But what do we 
drink when we're dehydrated from drinking beer? You got it: Yale™ 
Spring Water, the exclusive beverage of Yale University. But is Yale™ 
Water Yale's water? Are we so true to our alma mater's blue wishbone 
that we can taste it? 
I decided to find out. 
So one windy February afternoon, I donned my 0. Press) bow-tie 
and my (Barrie Boaters, Ltd.) shoes and made my way to the Yale™ 
Post Office. And there, next to Snow Job's eager promotional team, I 
called school spirit from its postal beyond. In one set of cups, marked 
"X," I poured New Haven tap water. In a second, marked "Z," I 
poured Yale™ Spring Water, and a third, marked "0," I filled with 
Princeton ™ Stadium Water (smuggled out of Jersey by a New journal 
operative). Harvard doesn't have bottled water, so, for the purposes of 
my survey, Princeton does matter. Aside from their hydro-preference, 
students reported their gender, year, and whether they regularly 
consume Yale™ Water. 
Pretty soon we got our first scientific result! Most Yale students 
surveyed said they would not submit to a blind taste test of lukewarm 
Ivy water. 
Eventually, though, the Snow Jobbers bored of their 
Whiffenpoof~ry and took the challenge. 
The incredible conclusion? Yale students prefer to drink water 
from cups marked "0." UnfortUnately for our experiment, this means 
that Princeton wins. On average, Yale students prefer it about ten 
percent more than the home Bow. The good news is that the women 
fEBRUARY 12, 1999 
of Yale have remained true to their school just like they would to 
their ... Anyway, they're relatively indifferent to Princeton, ranking it 
about equally with Yale. Men, however, prefer Stadium Water by about 
20 percent. A glimmer of hope: apparendy, our water is an acquired 
taste. Respondents who claimed to drink Yale™ Water regularly 
actually preferred it to Princeton's, where the uninitiated chose 
Princeton ™ Water about 29 percent of the time. 
I don't know about you, but something seems fishy about these 
results, and it's not the water; no fish could live in New Jersey's 
poisonous sludge. We're talking about the state that has violated the 
Clean Drinking Water Act more than any other. There's no way in hell 
their sludge beats our sludge. Where is this Princeton Spring anyway? 
The snow-capped peaks of Newark? The natural spas of Elizabeth? 
The hidden valleys of Fort Lee? 
The answer may shock you. Princeton ™ Water is not from New 
Jersey. It's from the Catskills, in upstate New York. Worse, there's 
nothing Princeton about it (except that it's a fraud). The whole 
operation is outsourced to a mysterious conglomerate called "Leisure 
Time Spring Water," which owns the spring and slaps "Princeton" 
labels on a few of the hordes. How fabulously exclusive. Yale ™ Water, 
as we all know, comes from Willington in our good old Constitution 
State. No shady subcontracts. Just smooth, fresh spring water that 
happens to taste vaguely sebaceous. 
So Princeton won. But they had to cheat to bring it off. How sadly 
typical. I think maybe I'll have a beer.
