junior Year Abroad 
Three years ago, the class of 1999 became 
the first class required to live on campus as 
sophomores. The administration created this 
new regulation to bolster the strength and 
cohesiveness of the residential colleges, and 
perhaps it has. It also has had a paradoxical 
effect, however: as all of the sophomores 
packed into the already crowded rooms of 
their colleges, they forced more of their fellow 
college members into the exile of annex 
housing. When Yalies enter the room lottery 
in the spring of each year, those with the 
lowest picks inevitably face exclusion from 
housing in their college. 

Walking across Old Campus to a suite in 
McClellan Hall, I expected to interview a 
lone annexee. Upon entering the room, 
however, I was confronted with several sofas 
full of JErs. "In JE annex housing, it's not like 
6 
you're exiled from JE," said Julia Rusinek OE 
'00), a resident of McClellan. When Rusinek 
moved into annex housing she moved with a 
sizable contingent. This year, like most years, 
over half of the junior class of JE is annexed, 
filling all of entryway A of McClellan; the 
juniors staying behind in JE are more likely 
to feel left out than those physically excluded 
from JE. "The people of JE are more 
important to me than the physical structure 
of JE," said Andrew Krause OE '00). In the 
McClellan annex he certainly has these 
people, a veritable community~ of JE 
expatriates deep in the freshman territory of 
Old Campus. The annexees all agreed that 
McClellan Hall itself is a benefit of being 
annexed; in addition to spacious rooms in 
good repair, it affords JE juniors a good view 
of the antics of the feisty freshman class. 

The environment Luis Quan (DC '00) 
finds in his annex housing could hardly be 
further from that found in McClellan. His 
apartment at 210 Park Street is the only Yale 
housing in the building; in fact, Yale does not 
even own the apartment he lives in, but rents 
it for him from a private landlord. For some, 
giving up the closeness of living in their 
residential college might be difficult, but 
Quan said that living at a slight remove 
provides "a really good balance." He is able to 
participate in the social life across the street, 
but can leave Davenport for the quiet of his 
own apartment whenever he chooses. "I've 
done berter academically, actually," he said. 

Although Quan likes his annex 
apartment, he is less glowing in his 
assessment of this Yale phenomenon than the 
JErs I spoke with. Earlier in the year, several 
other residents complained that he was 
making too much noise. Quan, who values 
his apartment precisely for the quiet it affords 
him, insisted that he was not the source of 
the disturbance. The other tenants 
complained to Davenport Master Gerald 
Thomas; Master Thomas subsequently gave 
two warnings to the confused and frustrated 
Quan and even threatened removal if the 
noise did not stop. Finally, Quan slipped 
notes under all the apartment doors in the 
building, protesting the unfair accusations 
against him and asking the source of the 
mysterious clamor to stop. The situation 
seems to be resolved now, although Quan's 
regard for the administration of his college 
has been tarnished by the experience. 

Shelby Batchelor (TO '01) resides in the 
TO annex at 370 Temple Street, across from 
the language lab. "When I told my friends 
where I was going to be living, they said, 'Oh 
no ... the Rock!'"-a reference to 370's 
similarity to Alcatraz in its isolation from 
civilization and its somewhat forboding 
facade. But I doubt that any inmates' cells in 
the infamous San Francisco Bay prison 
resembled the rooms in 370; several floors 
up, Batchelor lives in two connecting rooms 
that once served as a double. Life in the TO 
annex, despite the warnings of her friends, 
has not been an onerous exile for Batchelor, 
but an opportunity for more privacy. "I've got 
that only child thing," she said, "I need my 
own space." Three seventy does have its own 
oddities; the aged radiator makes loud 
spitting and gurgling noises and plaster 
sometimes peels away from the wall. Shelby 
sometimes wishes she lived closer to the 
exciting Yale melee, but acknowledges that 
TO, although heralded for its tight-knit 
community, isn't that close either. Like the 
residential colleges, the annexes have their 
-quirks and peculiarities; whether or not Yalies 
find life in them enjoyable depends on 
whether their own quirks match.

Wharton-watch out. Yale School of 
Management's (SOM) recent change in 
degree name from MPPM (Masters of Public 
and Private Management) to MBA (Masters 
of Business Administration) will give the 
school a new competitive edge. The new 
name back-tracks on what the SOM 
recruitment brochure has long emphasized: 
that the MPPM is not just an ordinary MBA, 
but an MBA Plus. 

Despite a change in label, the school 
intends to keep the rather exclusive contents 
of its package, according to SOM Dean 
Jeffrey Garten. "The mission of SOM will 
stay constant: to educate global leaders for 
business and society," Garten recendy wrote 
in a letter to the faculty. The school has long 
focused on the integration of the private, 
public and non-profit sectors of the economy 
and how they function together. This 
progress\ve approach has consistendy earned 
the school the number one spot in the non- Â· 
profit management category in US Naus anti 
World &port's Best GradU4U Schools.
