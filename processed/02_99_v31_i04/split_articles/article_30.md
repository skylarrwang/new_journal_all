In Sapporo, japan, and Nnu Haven, Connecticut, all must begin with the 
rice. For aspiring sushi chefi in both towns, rice represents more than a 
staple, more than a simple grain. It is the basis of all sushi-from Temaki 
hand rolls and cylindrical Maki rolls to raw fish Nigiri slices. He who 
cannot prepare rice will never make sushi. 

Seikichi Moto, a 12-year sushi veteran and co-owner of Hama 
Japanese Restaurant in Hamden, Cf, makes his rice in a deep 
wooden basin about three feet in diameter. Balanced on a garbage 
can in the middle of the kitchen, the huge basin steams eerily under 
bright fluorescent lights. With a large wooden paddle in one hand and 
a bottle of mysterious golden liquid in the other, Moto leans through 
the steam and tosses the white grains into the air with sharp, furious 
flicks of his arm. In less than five minutes the basin is clean, the rice 
flavored ana ready for use. 

Moto's mysterious golden brew represents the last in a series of 
careful steps to achieve the perfect sushi rice. Any hopeful chef must 
first develop an eye for judging the quality of his crop. Sushi chefS in 
both Japan and America prefer Japanese rice because it remains sticky 
even when cool, and only rice that has dried for over a year will do. 
"New crop is no good for sushi," says Tadahiro Hayasaka (Haya for 
short), another immigrant from Sapporo and owner of Haya's Japanese 
Restaurant in New Haven. "Cook time is very difficult because already 
has so much moisture, but .... " He shakes his head. "No choice 
sometimes." 

In a craft that strives for perfection in both taste and display, 
improperly cooked rice poses a serious problem. Rice too wet will tear 
straight through a piece of seaweed or will pack so tightly it renders a 
piece of Nigiri sushi inedible. Rice too dry (including American rice, 
which loses moisture as it cools) will fall right out of a Malci or Temalci 
roll or will fail to pack properly into the bed necessary for Nigiri raw 
fish. Learning how to determine proper moisture for each batch of rice 
may take months, and even once a hopeful chef masters moisture, he 
must still master flavoring. As a requirement of the trade, Japanese 
sushi chefs hide their flavoring secrets under a cloud of intrigue, 
keeping their recipes even from their apprentices. "In Japan, men in 
general have put a large value on their professional success as a measure 
of who they are, so they hold on to what they know," says Bun Lai, a 
29 year ola Japanese-American who grew up working in his mother's 
Miya's Japanese Restaurant in New Haven. "They don't want a peon 
coming in and being better than them." Eventually, a young ~d 
ambitious sushi chef must use clandestine thievery and crypuc 
deciphering methods to divine the proper ingredients for sushi rice. 
The wait before making sushi can take up to five years. 

In the first five years, a young sushi chef hopeful may spend more 
time washing dishes than making rice. "You do a lot of little 
things," Lai says. "Basically, imagine being someone's personal 
slave." Mter a couple of years, when rice-making becomes more 
familiar and other "peons" have entered under the sushi chef, the 
apprentice can move on to cleaning and cutting fish, the second step 
on the road to sushi mastery. Duties under cleaning and cutting range 
from removing the skin of the fish and slicing it for use in Nigiri to 
making marinades for the chef and scrubbing fish guts off the bar at 
the end of the day. According to Lai, sushi chefS deliberately withhold 
fish cleaning, cutting, and flavoring secrets from their apprentices just 
as they withhold rice-cooking secrets. With their progress so 
calculatedly slow, it may take several additional years before the chefs-
in-training identify fish preparation skills, let alone master them. 

Japanese patrons, though, accept nothing less than mastery-one 
wrong slip of the knife can render a rare and expensive piece of fish 
unfit for use, and improper cleaning and curing of raw fish always 
hazards the danger of food poisoning. Only after mastering fish cutting 
can a hopeful chef begin to think of working solo. 

While learning the rudiments of preparing Nigiri sushi proves 
difficult for beginners, making the move from apprentice to chef is 
nearly impossible. With veterans hoarding their positions at the head 
of the bar, few rising chefs get a chance to enter the spotlight. "You 
may never be a starting man," Lai says, because "the starting man may 
be there his entire career." For the majority of Japanese sushi chefS still 
under the tutelage of another chef, the dream of one day escaping from 
the oppressive apprentice system provides the only spark of enthusiasm 
in a sea of tedium. "Japan, people work in restaurant not only for 
money," Haya says. "People like to work and learn the skill. If they 
learn something, maybe one day [they can] open up own restaurant." 

But according to Haya, even the most skillful chefs cannot open 
restaurants if they lack the capital. Over the past two decades, Japan's 
sushi market has become flooded with men of poor or little training 
who own restaurants only because their parents have the money to buy 
them one. "In Japan, sushi every place, just like McDonald's," Moto 
sighs. Not only has market saturation increased competition and 
lowered profits, it has removed the honor that once attracted sushi chef 
hopefuls to the business. Young chefS looking for distinction then 
have two choices: suffer through the ten or more years of training
