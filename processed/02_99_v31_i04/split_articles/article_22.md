How did a troubled man of letters break 
the Elizabethan Club's unwritten rules? 
Elizabahan Club Constitution, Artick Xl/L Section 7 
~y mn{lbn- may b~ cmsured, suspmded, or ncp~lkd, for caus~. by a 
vote of three-fourths of the Board of Governors ... " 
first time in the Lizzie's history, formally suspending a member for a 
period of at least six months. 
The member (we'll call him Allan North), an English major, poet 
and intellectual, received the club's traditional letter of welcome in the 
beginning of the 1970s, during his junior year. In late August of 1998, 
another letter on Elizabethan Club stationery summoned him to the 
Orange Street law offices of Jacobs, Grudberg, Belt & Dow. There, in 
early September, the club's Governors explained to the alumnus that 
his unusual behavior had forced them to hold the constirutionally 
required formal hearing and to begin the process which might lead to 
censure, suspension, or expulsion. The club's vice president, librarian 
Patricia Willis, then read a series of charges, a wimess to the event says. 
North's sole breach of club rules appeared to be 
a single occasion on which he smoked a 
cigarette in the club. The essence of the charges, 
however, was his transgression of the old-
fashioned decorum so important to the Lizzie's 
character: his conversational intrusiveness, his 
violation of members' personal space, and his 
imposition on the dub's live-in steward, Leslie 
Landgraf. North spoke in his own defense, 
denying some charges and promising not to 
repeat others. Though he had been visibly 
battling mental illness, over the course of the 
semester, he appeared impressively composed to 
at least one Governor, George Raine UE '96 
I.AW '00). 
Over a week later, on September 15, the full Board of Governors 
met on the club's second floor, seated on comfortable armchairs 
beneath a portrait of Wtlliam Shakespeare in 
a dark, book-lined room. The Board, whose 
members are elected to serve one- and two-
year terms, administers the club's day-to-day 
affairs. Its current president, Emeritus 
Professor of English George Hunter, opened 
the meeting in his Glaswegian accent, and 
then gave way to the heads of the Social, 
Admissions, and other committees for their 
reports. As the Board's six undergraduate 
members, none of whom had been privy to 
the previous week's hearing, sat in silence, the 
older members of the board discussed what 
was to be done with North. He had been 
using the Lizzie for its intended purposes-
only too often, artd too much. 
"The Lizzie's practice is to rule by 
consensus," says Raine, an active Governor 
whose devotion to the club and careful 
manners make him an ideal member. But 
that day the Board moved toward consensus 
through an atmosphere marked by controlled 
tension. Beinecke curator Stephen Parks (SY 
'61), the club librarian and a dominant figure 
at the Lizzie, spoke vehemently against 
allowing North to return, and was seconded 
by a graduate student Governor who 
appeared to feel personally threatened by 
him, according to two undergraduate Board 
members. By the same account, two other 
Governors, who had met privately with 
North on several occasions, spoke in his 
defense: Raine and surgeon-turned-author 
Richard Selzer, the chairman of the Board of 
Incorporators, the body that holds the dub's 
ultimate power. 
The meeting's outcome was a blunt letter, 
composed joindy but signed by vice president 
Willis. "Three-fourths of the Board of 
Governors voted to suspend you from the 
club for six months, that is until March 15, 
1999," a late draft of the letter informed him. 
"During the period of your suspension," it 
continued, "you are to make no use of the 
Club House. An envelope, stamped and 
addressed to the Club, accompanies this letter 
for the purpose of your returning your key 
for the duration." 
Phrased in the Lizzie's courteous, 
conservative style, the letter gave no reason 
for the suspension, and offered no 
consolation. But North now says that he 
needed no explanation: his behavior had 
challenged one of those unwritten rules that 
keep the Flizabethan Club the last bastion of 
an earlier, more decorous Yale. 


Unwrittm Rule: Don't gtt pmonal 
Late in February of 1998, North 
returned to his dub. He says that he 
had stopped by occasionally during his 
more than 20-year absence from Yale, but 
now he was moving back to New Haven. He 
requested a new key from Leslie, the quiet, 
well-liked steward, and put down a $2 
deposit. North's tweedy dress, politely 
aristocratic manner, and conservative aspect 
matched the dub's atmosphere. However, the 
new face and unusual manner also stood out 
among the club's regulars. 


Upon receiving the key, he entered a 
building that had changed litde since he had 
last been there-one Governor recalls the 
impassioned responses to a suggestion that a 
single picture be moved. The narrow entry 
hall opens on its right to a well-lit social 
room, where a side table displays copies of 
Country Lift, British Htritagt, and Tht 
Sptctator. Portia, the voice of conservative 
feminism at Yale, lies casually on a coffee 
table. At the end of the entry hall is the tea 
room, where members come from four to six 
to eat off of silver service and white table 
cloths. The weekday buffet, prepared by the 
steward, includes cookies, tea, and a rigid 
succession of sandwiches: Monday, tomato; 
Tuesday, cucumber; Wednesday, turkey salad; 
Thursday, cinnamon toast; Friday, tuna salad; 
Saturday, a choice between peanut butter & 
jelly and cheese; Sunday, date-nut bread with 
cream cheese. 


Nearly empty for most of the day, the 
building fills up around tea time with 
members who include faculty, students, staff 
and alumni. On a recent Friday, tea began 
with an opening of the club's vault to display 
some of its treasures, including about a dozen 
Shakespeare quartos and a Milton first 
edition. Members sat and stood in groups, 
sipping tea and downing tiny tuna salad 
sandwiches. Two casually dressed women 
talked at the top of the stairs while a group of 
men in ties and white sweaters and women in 
dark-colored skirts and dresses gathered 
around a table in the tea room for serious 
discussion. In a room toward the back of the 
house, a professorly man spoke in an Italian 
accent to two younger women. They drank 
tea and looked out on the well-trimmed 
garden, where, in the summer, members play 
croquet under a huge bust of William 
Shakespeare. 


Perhaps cliques are inevitable in a dub 
like the Lizzie, whose application process has 
changed little in recent decades: current 
members drop letters in support of 
candidates into the dark wooden Admissions 
Committee box on a table at the left side of 
the entry hall. Candidates who receive the 
minimum of two letters are evaluated by the 
Admissions 
Committee 
for 
their 
commitment to the goals of the club. Some 
members perceive a quiet split in the dub 
between the well-dressed, often politically 
conservative students who maintain the club's 
stated purpose of literary and intellectual 
discussion, 
and the 
more 
liberal 
undergraduates who are sensitive to 
accusations of elitism and come primarily for 
the pleasant setting and free food. A junior 
woman in t-shirt and jeans is typical of those 
who are less concerned with the club's 
decorum, saying, "It's like going out to coffee 
with someone but you don't have to pay. It's a 
nice place to have, and it's no stupider than 
the secret societies." Crystal McKellar (TC 
'99), a member of the Admissions 
Committee, represents the club's conservative 
leanings: "If someone maintained their 
membership for a reason as petty as free 
sandwithes, I would be shocked and 
dismayed." 


North is among the Elizabethan Club 
faithful. "I am a great believer in decorum,"
