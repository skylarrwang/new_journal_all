EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
harsher American experiences of blacks, and 
presumably other groups, warrant stronger 
remedies than were needed for Jews may be a 
stronger defense of affirmative action than 
trying to dc'iw a Jewish-minority parallel. 
Still, it was not an argument well-suited to 
Hillel. 
Jewish students raised on 
grandparents' stories of anti-Semitism may 
chafe at the notion that they were the 
beneficiaries of "white privilege," even if the 
claim has some truth to it. 

A similar sentiment was expressed by 
Oren. Despite his understanding of the 
differences between the two situations, he 
agreed with the general goal of increasing 
diversity and even spoke favorably of the 
activists' original letter, the one the Student 
Board rejected. Rather than draw a parallel 
between Jews' history at Yale in this century 
and that of women and minorities, Oren 
invoked ancient biblical history. "A Jew is 
instructed to remember that he was once a 
slave in Egypt and that he was delivered from 
slavery," he said. "So the idea of siding with 
the underdog and fighting for truth and 
justice is a very strong tradition within 
Judaism." 

Explaining the Jewish commitment to 
social justice, former Hillel Student Co-
coordinator Claire Sufrin (CC '00), like 
Oren, referred to biblical imperatives. She 
recalled Exodus 23:9, a passage that for her 
"says it all": "You shall not oppress a stranger, 
for you know the feelings of the stranger, 
having yourselves been strangers in the land 
of Egypt." Perhaps the tenure activists' hopes 
of winning Hillel's support lay in 
emphasizing the analogous fttlings of being 
an outsider at Yale, and not in trying to 
construct a somewhat dubious historical 
paralld. For no two situations in history are 
truly analogous; there will always be facts that 
do not match. In taking a stand, it is often 
necessary not to dwell on such facts. As 
Nietzsche wrote, "Forgetting is essential for 
action of any kind"-Tenure Action 
included.
