EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“Give the facts, but share your personal experience,” 
says Joe Admissions, making friendly eye contact with the 
table of new recruits. When I applied to be a summer tour 
guide, I thought the job would be particularly easy for me, 
considering I grew up in New Haven and fancy myself as 
having some insider knowledge. Then, I read the “Yale 
Tour Facts” sheet and realized I didn’t know any of the bul­
let points. Some were interesting. A couple were wrong. 
Most were myths about statues. It was unclear how exactly 
I would give the facts and share my personal experience 
when some of the facts directly contradicted the history I’d 
amassed over my time on campus and in the city. In some 
ways my insider’s knowledge made me an outsider to the 
Yale presented in the Yale tour.


When I arrived for my first day, thinking my shift 
would consist of working the desk, I was informed that 
I had misread the spreadsheet. It turned out I had been 
scheduled for my first tour instead. 
“Great!” I shrieked to the student who was actually 
assigned to work the desk. I hadn’t looked at the fact sheet 
since the trial tour a few months back, during which I may 
or may not have forgotten Nathan Hale’s dying words 
until my interviewers pointed out they were engraved in 
rather large print around the base of his statue. I walked 
to the front of the visitor’s room and turned off the tele­
vision playing “That’s Why I Chose Yale,” the zealous, 
undergraduate-produced admissions video released in 
2010 to Internet celebrity.
“Welcome to Yale!” I said, clasping my hands profes­
sionally. “Will this half of the room come with me?” 


I. SOME BACKGROUND ON NEW HAVEN
Before we get started on Yale, let’s bust a few myths 
about New Haven. First, even though John Davenport 
founded the New Haven colony in 1638, the first people to 
inhabit this land were of the Quinnipiac tribe. Davenport 
purchased the land from the Quinnipiac, who then helped 
the New Haven settlers survive their first winters. If the 
Quinnipiac hadn’t already been living here for centuries, 
it’s unlikely that the European colony would have pulled 
through.


Perhaps in part because of that, the white guilt in this 
town is pretty staggering, so if you attend a New Haven 
Public Schools school you’ll likely spend your first eight 
years learning about Native Americans. A fully Caucasian 
visiting poet named Dan might regularly come to your 
fourth grade classroom and ask you to write poems from 
the perspective of Native Americans whose land has been 
invaded by Columbus. Some representatives of unknown 
heritage from Mohegan Sun will come tell you old Quin­
nipiac stories. This will be confusing, since you’d always 
thought Mohegan Sun was a casino where people went to 
see Kelly Clarkson and drink fine liquors. You will learn 
about twenty different kinds of sixteenth-century Native 
American dwellings. Yet somehow your teachers will 
fail to mention the fact that Native people are still alive. 
Thanks, Dan.


New Haven is also famous for food and firsts. We’re 
home to the first hamburger, the first Frisbee, the first 
factory to use interchangeable parts, and the first 
recorded use of the term “SWUG.” We’ve got a big Italian 
population, so our city is littered with amazing pizza and 
heated divisions among restaurant patrons, with the most 
famous being the Pepe’s/Sally’s divide. I’m a Pepe’s girl 
myself, though rumor has it Pope Benedict used to order 
Sally’s when he came to the Northeast, even if he was just 
crashing in New York for the night. What a diva. 


II. SILLIMAN COURTYARD
Welcome to the Silliman Courtyard. Maybe you recog­
nize it from the news. Isn’t it horrifying how it looks like 
this tree has an eye? 


Great, let’s move on.


III. WOOLSEY HALL
Ahh, Woolsey Hall, the alternate rain location of every 
high school graduation in New Haven. This is where 
the famous people come to speak—unless they’re really 
famous, in which case they speak at some undisclosed 
location and you find out a month later that they ever 
came (I’m looking at you, Meryl). Once I saw Morgan 
Freeman speak about the unique benefits of reading on a 
child’s developing mind. So there you have it: even Mor­
gan Freeman thinks the kids are watching too much TV 
these days.


Woolsey Hall is also home to the biggest nighttime 
racket in all of Yale: the YSO Yale Symphony Orchestra’s 
Halloween Show, for which Yalies “supposedly” play a 
live score over an “original” film they have “supposedly” 
“made.” If anyone ever scores tickets, please let me know 
so that I can verify the aforementioned rumors.  


On the other side of Woolsey Hall you’ll see Com­
mons—sorry, I mean the Schwarzman Center, donated 
graciously by the honorable Mr. Schwarzman Center. 
Currently students and faculty are brainstorming Ydeas 
for the Center’s future, such as my Ydea, which is to make 
the doors lighter.



IV. CROSS CAMPUS
Here we are at Cross Campus, which is apparently 
called Cross Campus because it’s shaped like a cross. Who 
knew? Underneath us is the behemoth known as Bass 
Library, where many a Yalie goes to be seen studying and, 
on occasion, running naked through the stacks.


All of the old-looking buildings around you were built 
by this architect named James who had a major hard-on 
for Oxford and Cambridge. I didn’t realize this until I vis­
ited Oxford a few years ago and experienced a tsunami of 
déjà vu. Yale’s campus is essentially a theme park version 
of Oxford—the buildings look authentic until you look 
down at your feet and see the gummed-over sidewalks 
and some kid’s vomit.


Also underground is a series of tunnels that connects 
parts of campus. You can climb into them through some 
key sewer grates on College and Wall streets—though 
these are heavily trafficked by cars, so it’s best to choose a 
friend you don’t like that much to sit in the middle of the 
street while you unscrew the grate. Decades of townies 
have traversed these tunnels, spray paint in hand, mark­
ing them with some of New Haven’s most infamous tags 
(such as the elusive “Milf Shake”). There’s even a room 
down there with a couch and a light with “BUCK FUSH” 
marked angrily on the wall. I mean, not that I would know 
from personal experience because going into the tunnels 
is illegal and I am a law-abiding citizen. Quick: I see a 
cop. Let’s move.
