an institution that essentially is fundamentally elitist 
and does not give people the opportunity who are from 
lower socio-economic backgrounds to actually be a part 
of this group,” Wyatt said.

The scholarship program has made a difference for 
Theta, at least in the eyes of a few new members. But 
it required the chapter to sidestep traditional rules in a 
way that is perhaps difficult for others to replicate.

In Pi Phi, the “Greenwich girl” slideshow is now 
gone—a change intended to make the recruitment 
process a more level playing field. In Theta, it contin­
ues, though one member emphasized that in recent 
years members have been asked to introduce only close 
friends, and that the sorority hasn’t decided whether 
it will continue the slideshow tradition this year. But 
while Theta and Pi Phi both contend with highly 
restrictive national organizations, the rule regarding 
fundraising that Theta seems to have circumvented 
appears especially strict for Pi Phi, which has not estab­
lished a scholarship program. 

Some members argue that, even as campus at large 
has paid more attention to concerns of inclusivity and 
racial diversity, Pi Phi has remained predominantly 
white. Due to international organization rules about 
speaking with the press, the current executive board 
of Pi Phi and members contacted individually either 
declined to comment for this piece or did not respond 
to requests. A spokeswoman for the international orga­
nization also declined to comment.

Weston told me she was frustrated by how few women 
of color were in the sorority during her time at Yale. 
Out of forty-four members in her pledge class, Weston 
counted four black women, one of whom withdrew 
before graduating. Chapter President Miranda McKay 
declined to provide statistics about the number of their 
members who are women of color, but Weston, among 
several other women interviewed, perceived a decline 
in Pi Phi’s diversity during her time at Yale. “It’s been 
noticeable to the point that I’ve talked to other people 
about it,” Weston said.

Harris and Weston told me that the underrepresenta­
tion of women of color in Pi Phi isn’t the only problem. 
They say the culture of Greek life, and of fraternities in 
particular, is hostile to women of color. Weston stopped 
attending mixers with fraternities. “I did feel marginal­
ized. Just in terms of feeling beautiful,” she told me. 
“What people are looking for, what is seen as hot in 
SAE [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] and Sig Ep. And obviously 
it sucks to wonder what the guys are going to want, but 
you want to be talked to, and when your friend next 
to you is chatting and you’re just standing there, you 
notice these things. It’s one of those unspoken truths 
with women of color.” 

Olivia, the self-described “ambassador for Pi Phi” to 
the Af-Am House, deactivated from the sorority after 
a brother from SAE—which disassociated from its 
national organization in May and is now called Leo—
addressed her using a racial slur at Spring Fling. She 
told me she didn’t feel comfortable turning to her Pi 
Phi sisters for support. 

“I knew nothing would come of it and there wouldn’t 
be a response from my sisters,” Olivia explained. “They 
would have found a way to excuse it.” (Leo President 
Grant Mueller said he was unaware of the incident 
Olivia described and “would definitely not condone 
that in any sort of fashion.”)

Olivia said it wasn’t until she heard about the pro­
tests this fall that she realized her problem with Pi 
Phi had been with the frats they associated with. Like 
Weston, she said that “racialized dating preferences” 
often caused her to be left out of conversations at mix­
ers. Sometimes the brothers made her feel invisible. “I 
always felt kind of flabbergasted at the fact that every 
time they would meet me, it was like ‘oh who are you 
again?’ You know very well who I am.” 

Last fall, at a Pi Phi–specific discussion about race, 
members of color voiced that they felt the sorority 
should not mix with SAE again. It was a serious pro­
posal—Pi Phi had long been unofficially “paired” with 
SAE for many campus mixers and events. Jenny Allen, 
an Asian-American former member who resigned from 
Pi Phi in 2015, recounted a similar discussion in the 
spring of 2015. After SAE was accused of violating 
Yale’s code of sexual misconduct, Allen went to the

Pi Phi executive board to propose that they cancel an 
upcoming mixer, an incident Harris and Olivia also 
remember. The Executive Board agreed to cancel, but 
it didn’t cut ties between the two groups. 

Harris told me she wasn’t sure what conclusion the 
Pi Phi board had eventually come to in the fall. She 
said she was dissatisfied with what she perceived as an 
initial lack of action. 

Leo President Mueller says that Pi Phi ultimately 
decided to stop mixing with SAE last fall, and they 
gave SAE tips on how they could improve. Mueller 
says the organization is trying to listen. “They wanted 
to see more overt efforts to make our house as safe as 
possible,” he said. He explained that Leo is “really tak­
ing it over the top now” with female bartenders and 
increased sober monitors, but he did not mention any 
changes outside of party environments.

At the end of each of my interviews, I asked my subject 
to recommend other sorority members I should speak 
with. Thetas, in particular, were excited to recommend 
friends. At the beginning of the interview process I was 
surprised by the names they easily rattled off: women of 
color, women from low-income backgrounds, women 
who are passionate about social justice. 

At first, it seemed like there was an almost over­
whelming number of sorority women from what I con­
sidered “non-traditional” backgrounds. However, as I 
continued my interviews, the names began to repeat: 
Celeste Dushime, Sophie Freeman, Jessica Leão, Nat 
Wyatt, Diana. It soon became clear that this group of 
Theta changemakers might be smaller and more insu­
lar than I had initially thought. 

On several occasions, I mentioned in conversation 
with subjects that I had spoken to a queer woman of 
color in Theta. Almost everyone I spoke to guessed it 
was Dushime. I asked Dushime if she ever worries that 
Theta is tokenizing her. She laughed. 

“I always wonder if my achievements that I’ve 
accomplished here are because I deserve to be admit­
ted, or if I got admitted because I’m a Rwandan female 
student applying,” she said. Wyatt had similar qualms 
about the recruitment process. “Yeah, I look very dif­
ferent from everyone else in Theta, I really do,” they 
said. “But, that being said, I went to Exeter, I’m from 
New York City, I’m affluent, I’m white. I’m gender 
non-conforming, but to them I look like a combination 
of Ruby Rose and Justin Bieber.” Theta isn’t yet at a 
point where Wyatt feels comfortable encouraging trans 
or non-binary friends of color to join. 

Increasingly, women seeking single-gender spaces 
at Yale have options beyond sororities. The Yale Black 
Women’s Coalition, founded in 2006, seeks to pro­
vide a network for Black women at Yale. Dara Hug­
gins, YBWC President until this spring, described the 
group’s mission as “to cultivate a space where Black 
women on campus could discuss various topics related 
to that community, have social events, and act as a net­
work for professional and academic reasons.” Huggins 
says that membership in the YBWC has increased in 
the past year, specifically during the events of the fall. 
The YBWC doesn’t require their members to pay 
dues, or choose between their group and sorority life. 
They have several members who are also a part of soror­
ities. Huggins was quick to explain that the YBWC is 
not a sorority in any way, and “isn’t akin to the Divine 
Nine,” the national historically Black sororities and fra­
ternities. “However, I don’t think it’s coincidental that 
we don’t have that and we happen to only have this,” 
Huggins said of the absence of Black Greek life.

Yale’s multicultural sorority, Omega Phi Beta, has 
grown slowly since its Yale chapter was founded in 
March 2014 after five Yale students petitioned for its 
establishment. Olivia mentioned the income diver­
sity in multicultural and historically Black and Latino 
sororities, adding, “I think that’s something that more 
predominantly white sororities can learn from.” 

Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be much com­
munication between the Panhellenic sororities and 
Omega Phi Beta, or even the YBWC. “There is a very 
minimal relationship, and that relationship is mostly 
fueled by the fact that some of our members are part 
of the Panhellenic groups,” Huggins explained. “But 
there hasn’t been any kind of active reach-out that I 
can recall from sororities.” Some members told me 
Theta and Pi Phi don’t communicate much with each 
other, either.

Many people I spoke with were quick to explain 
that the diversity problems sororities are facing are 
not unique to those groups at Yale. Dushime said 
Yale “equips you early” to feel marginalized by class 
or income. Wyatt expressed that they think we “live 
in a society that has these issues,” and that “Greek life 
is a microcosm.” Weston’s early claim that she didn’t 
expect her sorority to go out of the way to support her as 
a marginalized person reflects a general sentiment that 
the problems of Theta and Pi Phi are the problems of 
Yale, and perhaps society more broadly.

Olivia was originally pessimistic about the institu­
tional potential of Yale sororities—until the end of our 
call, when she asked me what I’d learned throughout 
my research process. I mentioned Theta’s new initia­
tives, and she laughed in surprise. “Theta?” she nearly 
yelled, incredulously. She began describing the “old 
Theta” she’d witnessed at Yale: the huge group of 
mostly white wealthy women who were exclusive in

their friendships.

Almost every Theta member I talked to wanted to 
show me a picture of the new rush class. Like new 
parents, they proudly scrolled through their Facebook 
accounts and iPhone camera rolls. The diversity shows, 
they say.

It was not my first time seeing numerous photos of 
sorority women. Like most Yalies with a Facebook, I’d 
been privy to the several-hundred-photo filled albums 
Yale sororities upload after mixers.

“We’re notorious for our love of photos,” Olivia had 
said to me. She had also said that she felt the photos 
from sorority mixers often used lighting effects to make 
the women look more tan, thus washing out the sis­
ters of color.  According to Olivia, amid the glamorous 
flashing lights, she and the “handful” of Black mem­
bers had been erased. After our call, I revisited old pho­
tos of Theta and Pi Phi mixers from Facebook. I could 
see what she was talking about.

In the photos I was shown on Theta iPhones, this 
was not the case. The glossy veneer was gone, replaced 
by an occasional awkward Instagram filter. While the 
women weren’t all white, the racial diversity did not 
strike me as exceptional. Then again, I wasn’t shown a 
before and after picture.

It struck me that all the photos still depicted a select 
group. Even with slight improvements from Theta, Pi 
Phi, or other sororities at Yale and elsewhere, organi­
zations such as Greek groups still operate on a foun­
dation of exclusivity. While that tradition was born as 
a response to a more stark set of boundaries—one that 
blocked women from mostly male, already elite insti­
tutions—it now runs into problems of opening itself up 
to groups even more historically excluded. There’s no 
question that sororities are changing. The question is 
how much spaces like these can push against boundar­
ies they had a hand in creating.

As I looked at more photos, a before and after did 
begin to form in my head. Before were the near-pro­
fessional photos from events like the ones Olivia 
attended, and after were the more casual iPhone snaps 
which were shown to me as tokens of success. The 
Theta members who brandished them seemed to be 
almost urging me to notice the women of color. From 
background to foreground, I wondered how much had 
changed.
