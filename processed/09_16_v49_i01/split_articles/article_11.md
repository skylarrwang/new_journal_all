process, to the deafening effect of the air conditioner. 

“They don’t even know when they’ve moved into the 
system.” 

On Friday, the first few seconds crawl by silently. 
One of the Players, the middle aged woman in Asics, 
picks up the Rule Book before her and reads aloud. 
Then, the Players hold a brief vote, and each one’s 
primary suggestions are recorded. (Someone always 
takes notes in America, Honnor says). Forty-five min­
utes later, at the halfway point, Peter—the Player in 
the coat—buys his way into the center and pitches a 
brand new charitable initiative he’s named “Books and 
Bears.” Inspired by the sight of a child whose guardian 
was among the victims of the previous day’s wave of 
heroin overdoses—the cause of three deaths—Peter, a 
former Ward 8 Alderman, sought to establish an orga­
nization that would supply care packages to young 
children in the protective custody of law enforcement. 
Looking to inspire his less passionate fellow Benefac­
tors, he argued against local homeless shelter Colum­
bus House and the vague sentiment of “giving back to 
Arts & Ideas.” Well-spoken and emotional, Peter was 
accused of having an agenda. He fought back. “It’s seed 
money for a dream,” he insisted.

Making his way towards the door later, carrying $440 
in cash, Peter surprised everyone with a confession. His 
eloquent pitch was made on impulse. He found the 
early conversation to be “vaporous, liberal, do-goody 
shit,” and wanted to fight for a specific cause that had 
affected him deeply. The Money acts as a petri dish for 
performed selflessness to flourish, for a microcosm of 
society—or at least those who can afford the tickets—to 
push and pull in search of consensus. As Peter left with 
the cash and a new assignment, he griped, “My wife is 
going to kill me.” 

Later that night, as Alice and Emily ushered the 
remaining guests out of the Library, two local elemen­
tary school students still disagreed. Theo and Ripley, 
the youngest ever players of The Money, reflected on 
the group’s ultimately unanimous decision to split 
the money between oral surgery charity Operation 
Smile and a devised wealth-sharing program the group 
called “Dollars at the DMV.” If given sole control, Rip­
ley admitted she’d keep the money for herself. Theo 
insisted he’d give it away. 

Zoe, a professor at the School of Management who 
teaches negotiation, and Jen, Chief Inspiration Officer 
at an independent consulting firm, attempted to bridge 
the gap between their children. They offered a sugges­
tion discussed in that night’s game, though it was ulti­
mately vetoed: “Who wants to go hide some origami 
dollars on the Green?” A type of charity, perhaps, but 
an ornate one.
