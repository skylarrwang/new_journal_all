Mikayla Harris never thought of herself as a typical 
sorority girl. Like many women who become involved 
with sororities at Yale, she was attracted to the Univer­
sity in part because Greek organizations don’t dominate 
the social life. But sometime around the end of her first 
semester, after attending first classes, going to first keg­
gers, and making first friends, she began to wonder if 
something was missing. Like hundreds of other women 
at Yale seeking community, female friendship, and 
extracurricular and professional opportunities, Harris 
decided to rush. Unlike most women in sororities, Har­
ris is Black.
In the winter of 2014, Harris, now a senior, was ini­
tiated into Pi Beta Phi (Pi Phi). In her pledge class, 
she was one of eight women of color, part of a group 
that comprised about sixteen percent of the class—an 
unusually high figure for the sorority, Harris said. (In 
the Yale undergraduate population, about thirty per­
cent identify as students of color.) If Harris’s class devi­
ated from the Pi Phi norm, she says it was thanks to one 
woman: Olivia, an older Pi Phi member at the time 
and member of Yale’s Afro-American Cultural House. 
“She really wanted to make Pi Phi as diverse as possi­
ble,” Harris said of Olivia. “I was like, if people who 
look like me are in this, then Ill join it.”
Olivia described her work to make Pi Phi more inclu­
sive, with a tinge of irony, as being like “the ambassador 
for Pi Phi” to the Af-Am House. (Olivia asked to be 
identified by a pseudonym to avoid the backlash she 
said accompanies “the airing of uncomfortable truths 
within Yale’s Greek community.”) Harris also said she 
sometimes felt there was a “frustrating” burden on her 
to single-handedly diversify the group. “It’s a lot of pres­
sure on the women of color to get other women of color 
to join,” she explained.
Harris resigned—the official term for cutting ties—
from Pi Phi in the winter of 2016 in part because of 
time constraints, but also because she found it harder, 
as she puts it, to “push it out of my mind that I was 
one of the only Black people in a room” after the cam­
pus-wide demonstrations regarding race last fall.
Shortly after she made her decision, the ritual of rush 
unfolded much as it does every year, but Yale’s campus 
had changed. Throughout the fall, students witnessed 
charged conversations and protests about racial justice, 
and students of color described experiences that con­
tradicted the admissions brochure narrative of a com­
munity that is not only diverse but also fully inclusive. 
Student organizations at Yale put out Facebook state­
ments of their failures, desires to change, and support
