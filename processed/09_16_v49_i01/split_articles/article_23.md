Matthew Freiner sits in his makeshift office on the sec­
ond floor of the Devil’s Gear Bike Shop on Orange Street, 
leaning back in his folding chair. His desk is piled with 
random notes, and an array of cycling suits is tacked to 
the wall. Since 2001, he has designed and printed his own 
t-shirts and stickers, in addition to fixing bikes and selling 
gear. Matt Freiner loves making things, but making them 
in New Haven, he says, is especially rewarding.
“Ugh, God. It’s colossal,” he says said. “I mean, New 
Haven’s the home of the bicycle.”  
The Elm City claims to be the birthplace of a lot of 
things: the Frisbee, the hamburger, and planned cit­
ies, to name a few. (Technically, the bicycle’s city of 
origin is disputed: A German aristocrat invented the 
first human-powered, bike-like machine in 1813, but 
pedals weren’t added until a French immigrant to New 
Haven patented the design for use in “improvements 
of velocipedes” in 1866. Freiner never mentioned the 
German model.)
Outside, pasted next to the large orange Devil’s Bike 
logo and some sale notices is a sign printed in black 
and gold, featuring a large box with the words “Made 
in New Haven” and “Est. 1638” printed in simple let­
tering. 
Devil’s Gear received its sign last month, joining the 
ranks of New Haven stores that have been granted the 
designation as a part of the city-wide “Made in New 
Haven” campaign. The New Haven Office of Eco­
nomic Development and Project Storefronts, a city 
program that encourages entrepreneurship, started the 
initiative this summer and awarded the distinctive logo 
to New Haven stores that sell products manufactured 
in the city. The project aims to create a directory of 
small businesses that New Haven residents and visitors 
can use to shop locally, uniting the small bike-fixers, 
jewelry designers, and cheese mongers, and highlight­
ing stores that aren’t just selling things in New Haven, 
but making them here too. 
New Haven has been making things for a while. 
The city witnessed nearly two hundred years of indus­
trial prosperity, starting in 1798 when Eli Whitney, 
the inventor of the cotton gin and promoter of inter­
changeable parts, opened up the rifle factory where 
Samuel Colt would eventually later invent the auto­
matic revolver. By the time the smoke cleared from the 
American Civil War, New Haven was humming with 
activity. Through Throughout the late Nineteenth 
nineteenth century, thousands of Southern European 
immigrants were arriving arrived each year (see: New 
Haven’s famous pizza tradition) to produce not only 
rifles, but also brass hardware for Sargent, cigars for 
Osterweis & Sons, and the nation’s first lollipops for 
the Bradley Smith Company. During World War Two, 
the city supported the nation’s “Arsenal of Democracy” 
by housing factories founded by the legendary arms 
manufacturers O.F. Mossberg and Oliver Winchester.
