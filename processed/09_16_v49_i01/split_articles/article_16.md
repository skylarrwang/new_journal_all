There’s a charged silence as 22-year-old Matthew Bar­
rington Bethea IV, sitting in the Starbucks across from the 
New Haven Green, searches for the title of one of those 
songs he “put more of himself into.” He cannot remem­
ber its name, but he recalls the lyrics with ease: 
Don’t wait up ’cause time ain’t waiting on you;
You let all the problems pilin’ up, now the weight 
is on you.
You been strugglin’ in the street, claim you’re hun­
gry, tryna eat, 
But what happens when you look in the mirror 
and the weight is on you.
His voice lifts the stale air of the New Haven café 
where we sit. Bethea, or “IV” (pronounced as two let­
ters) as he’s known by his one thousand−plus fans on 
the online music platform ReverbNation, leans deli­
cately over the table. He seems at ease, yet he never 
removes his heavy coat. The song he offers, “HOW 
MUCH REALER,” is one of his “struggle-slash-moti­
vation” tracks. For his audience, it’s a call to action. 
For him, it’s a reflection on the weight he carries as a 
young rapper with a small following, trying to make it 
big. He wonders how to balance the uncertain future 
with his need to pay the bills; how to yank himself out 
of neutral to produce work that satisfies his standards 
and fans; how to speak to himself and to his audience 
simultaneously. 
“I mean, I do it with the intentions and hopes that 
the one person who’s going through this is hearing 
this,” he says. 
But how to reach that one person is an open ques­
tion for IV, other rappers in New Haven’s small but 
active hip-hop scene, and artists worldwide. IV says 
his goal is to “catch the listener” with lyrics that mat­
ter. He has recorded tracks with Phil Blount, owner of 
the recording studio No Gimmick in southwest New 
Haven. Since the nineteen-eighties rapper Steve Wil­
liams, known as “Stezo,” got two singles onto the Bill­
board 100 R&B/Hip-Hop Chart, no recent rapper from 
the city has been able to build a comparable national 
audience and put the city on the hip-hop map. IV, like 
many others, wants to change that. 

Connecticut’s first well-known rapper of the early 
nineteen-eighties, Tony Pearson (“Mr. Magic”), told 
the New Haven Register in 2011 that New Haven’s 
hip-hop scene is a gold mine for new talent, especially 
with the advent of home-recording software that allows 
IV and his peers to mix tracks in their bedrooms. But 
there’s no established pipeline for that talent to go to 
the big leagues. In the wake of New Haven mayor John 
DeStefano Jr.’s decision to raze the New Haven Coli­
seum in 2007 because of the steep cost of operation, 
few venues remain.
“We only have one place,” IV explains, referring to 
Toad’s Place. “We need more.”  

Blount recognizes IV’s potential to not only join the 
ranks of those rappers he places in New Haven’s rap 
elite—IB Trizzy, Tye Henney, and Wiley Don, who’ve 
all taken the stage on myriad occasions at Toad’s 
Place—but also to break through the limitations of 
New Haven’s music scene. Although IV has yet to reel 
in the number of local fans that IB Trizzy and Wiley 
Don have, Blount thinks IV could transcend their 
level: “IV raps way beyond his age in terms of his con­
tent.” According to Blount, IV “fits [New Haven] like 
a glove.” 

IV has dabbled in the 203’s vibrant rap battle scene, 
recorded a few tracks with Blount, and collaborated 
with other local rappers. His ReverbNation profile says 
he “sounds like” Drake and J. Cole. But those artists 
are far away, and there’s no road map from New Haven 
to where they are. 


IV’s interest in rap began when he was around six 
years old, riding shotgun in his uncle’s car with the 
radio blaring. “[My uncle] started rapping, and I asked 
him, ‘How do you do that?’ and he taught me how to 
do it, and then I started writing it,” IV recalls. “And he 
laughed at the first one I wrote, because it was garbage.” 
He worked from there. Throughout middle school, IV 
took the stage at poetry open-mic nights every second 
Thursday for cash prizes. In the family room with his 
mom, IV was immersed in the Motown sensuality of 
Stevie Wonder and Guess Who’s Back? by 50 Cent. 
“This is where I came from,” he says.
Born in Manhattan, he lost his father when he was 7 
and moved to New Haven when he was 16; his mother 
recently passed away. In the song “28° Fahrenheit,” he 
offers an intimate, pensive rendering of his relationship 
with his parents. He raps about the marked contrast 
between the advice of “Moms and Pops,” and the frag­
mentation he faced after they died:
My tie between my Moms and Pops completely 
disassemble
They took the road to Heaven, then I can’t afford 
the rental
Vivid dreams play in my mind as I’m tellin’ them 
what I’ve been through
Pops told me don’t be gentle; Mom said live it 
through the pencil.

IV’s foray into serious music composition began in 
a concrete-walled classroom at New Haven’s Wilbur 


Cross High School. In January of 2013, Donald Sawyer, 
an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Quinnipiac Uni­
versity, founded a hip-hop advisory program at Wilbur 
Cross. The inaugural class was made up of twenty-five 
young men, including IV. Many members had been 
affected by gun violence, economic deprivation, racial 
discrimination, and the daily reality of metal detectors 
and uniformed officers in their school hallways. Sawyer 
transformed his drab classroom into an artistic incuba­
tor, teaching poetry through the lens of music while 
encouraging each student’s unique voice. 

Sawyer recognized IV’s potential from the begin­
ning. “On the day we met,” Sawyer says, “it was clear 
that he was a talent. He had a mastery of the English 
language.” One of the most talented musicians of his 
class, IV stood out because of the way his lyrics con­
fronted adversity head-on. 

IV feels indebted to Sawyer, whom he calls “Don,” 
and the role he played in his artistic development. 
Aside from showing IV the value of weaving literary 
devices, irony, and rhyme into his work, Sawyer gave 
IV the tools to be a keen observer. “He taught me it’s all 
about taking in what’s going on around you,” IV says.

After his formative period in the “judgment-free 
zone” of Sawyer’s classroom, IV began performing in 
New Haven’s Arts and Ideas Festival in 2014, ‘open-
box’ rap-sparring events on the New Haven Green, and 
cyphers (continuous freestyle sessions) in New York 
and Connecticut. He won a talent show at Quinnipiac 
University this past February. Despite his growing vis­
ibility as an artist, IV’s music doesn’t pay his living; he 
works at Bruegger’s Bagels on Whalley Avenue. 

But there’s a reason why IV’s lyrics stood out to fig­
ures like Sawyer and Blount. His work takes from the 
wisdom of Jay-Z’s Decoded: “Bang out a rhythmic idea.” 
Even though IV was born decades after the lyricism of 
Gil Scott-Heron in the early nineteen-seventies and the 
dynamism of Run-DMC’s self-titled 1984 album, his 
music recalls those earlier styles. IV’s songs have what 
Sawyer calls “old soul […] touched by the golden era 
of hip-hop.”

When Sawyer drove IV to a rap battle in Lower Man­
hattan one late weeknight in high school, the roars of 
the crowd carried IV—“the kid from Connecticut?”—to 
a silver medal. “He showed that he was able to hang,” 
said Sawyer.


Even with the praise IV receives from Sawyer and 
Blount, there’s still room for him to penetrate the local 
New Haven music market by booking shows and mar­
keting himself to the community.

When he’s not working his day job, IV directs his 
efforts toward refining his first mixtape for release 
this fall. “I’m still trying to learn to balance life and 
music at the same time,” he admits. He scribbles down 
verses in his collection of “old-school” notebooks, and 
he invites his sixty-eight Facebook followers to rec­
ommend beats. He participates in cyphers every few 
months, like Grind Mode Cyphers in New York this 
July. He posts weekly rap videos from his desk or couch. 
In them, slivers of a pillow, blinds, or a blank wall are 
barely visible behind him as he raps, his shaky camera 
work intensifying the urgency of his delivery. He strate­
gically curates this new online material with hashtags 
and links to the social media sites of other artists. 

Yet these current efforts leave IV’s career stagnant 
or, at least, slow-growing; his ReverbNation followers 
fluctuate by just one or two each week. He is counting 
on his pending mixtape to establish him.

Unlike local pioneer Pearson, who has always clung 
to his New Haven roots, IV avidly seeks to avoid the 
local musician trap. He explains, “I’m trying to spread, 
I’m not just trying to be in New Haven, I’m not just 
trying to be in Connecticut, because…I don’t want to 
be ‘local.’ ‘Just local.’” 

For IV and amateur artists like him, the present 
moment is pivotal. As he tries to construct a distinct 
identity for himself, he must do so with sensitivity to 
the dichotomies that frame any early music career. At 
Bruegger’s, he’s Matt; on Facebook, he’s IV. As a lyricist, 
he studies poetics; as a musician, he wants to produce 
music that can be readily remixed in the club setting. 
He desires to bust through the boundaries of the “just 
local” 203; but, as Blount explains, he must wholly 
become IV, “change his government name,” define his 
audience, maintain virtual and physical proximity to 
that audience, and forge a brand that meets its needs. 
For now, it’s easy for IV to envision a future in which 
he is Drake-famous, reaching fans worldwide. It is 
harder for him to figure out the route to that future. 
Every few weeks, as he publishes a new Facebook 
recording, amassing close to one thousand views, he 
addresses the anonymous fan and theoretical viewer he 
isn’t quite sure how to reach. Watching him, I found it 
nearly impossible to hold his glassy gaze. He seems to 
treat the camera like a mirror, rapping for himself.
