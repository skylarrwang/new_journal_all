Windham-Campbell Literary Prize winners reflect on unexpected fame 

As Aminatta Forna, a novelist raised in Sierra Leone and 
Great Britain, sat down to work in her office one morning 
in 2014, she noticed an email from an unknown address 
bolded in her inbox. The message informed her she had 
just been awarded a major literary prize, and with it, an 
enormous amount of money. Instinctively, she thought it 
was a scam—maybe one of those “Nigerian-based hoaxes 
that try to persuade you they have a huge amount of cash 
they just need to put in your bank account for a few days.”

It was no hoax: Forna had just received a 2014 
Windham-Campbell Prize for Fiction, an award that 
included an unrestricted grant of $150,000 to support 
her writing career. (Forna isn’t the only one who nearly 
missed her award. As Time covered in March 2016, Aus­
tralian Fiction writer Helen Garner similarly discov­
ered she had won a Windham-Campbell Prize when 
she checked her email’s spam folder.) 

The Windham-Campbell Prizes, or the Donald 
Windham-Sandy M. Campbell Prizes at Yale Univer­
sity, were first awarded to writers in March 2013, quickly 
entering the literary award arena as some of the most 
remunerative worldwide. It’s the latest in a long leg­
acy; literary prizes have been around almost as long as 
literature itself. As the New York Times’ Daniel Men­
delsohn notes in his November 2013 piece “Whom or 
What Are Literary Prizes For?,” tragedy as a genre was 
invented by the ancient Greeks for a prize-oriented 
drama festival. The Windham-Campbell Prize, funded 
by the estate of the late writer Donald Windham, offers 
a cash award second only to the Nobel Prize for Litera­
ture. Yet unlike the Nobel (or its peers the Man Booker 
Prize, the National Book Award, or the Pulitzer), the 
Windham-Campbells are not book prizes, but instead 
recognize a writer’s entire body of work. In this sense,

they are more forward looking than others: they not 
only reward what a writer has already accomplished, 
but also anticipate the possibilities of what he or she 
might accomplish with more time, money, and public 
recognition.

Later this month, the nine winners of the 2016 Wind­
ham-Campbell Prizes will arrive on campus to receive 
their checks at the three-day prize festival. For most 
Yale students, the meaning of the prize is simple: a 
chance to rub elbows with the anointed literary elite, 
attend talks by famous speakers (this year’s keynote 
address will be delivered by the musician and mem­
oirist Patti Smith), and bask in the intellectual glow 
of writers discussing their work. For the winners, it is 
more complicated—a gift that comes with the implicit 
expectation of continued success in the future. 

Since the award is meant to come as a surprise, 
the selection committee does not contact nominated 
writers during the selection process. And although the 
prize money is intended to help liberate writers from 
financial concerns so they have more time to write, 
financial need cannot be taken directly into account. 
“We’ve given it to writers who needed it to pay for their 
health insurance and to writers who are wealthy,” said 
Michael Kelleher, the program director of WCP. “In 
terms of the impact on their career, that’s where the 
decision comes in.” That is, when choosing between 
two candidates of equal quality, the prize will more 
likely go to the lesser-known one. 

But not always. The prize goes to more established 
writers as well, such as the famous essayist Hilton Als, 
who won a 2016 Prize for Nonfiction and gave the key­
note address last year. Als joked in a phone interview 
that the prize “gives you a little boost and it gives you 
some money. Financial support gives you a trainer and 
a therapist to keep you going.” 

The archetype of the starving artist is compelled by 
some internal force to create, but hindered by finan­
cial burdens and the isolation and concentration that 
their work demands. The Windham-Campbell seems 
designed to ease this figure’s way. Adina Hoffman, a 
2013 recipient of the Windham-Campbell Prize for 
Nonfiction, describes her daily schedule as “either try­
ing to write or writing or erasing or scratching things 
out and rewriting or correcting proofs or looking at 
some archival letter or taking notes or staring at a pho­
tograph or checking the dictionary or reading a book 
that’s connected to what I’m trying to write.” Though 
Hoffman welcomed the money, “the prize itself was 
worth a great deal in other terms as well: it was a vote 
of literary confidence of the kind that doesn’t register 
on a bank statement.”

 Of course, that’s the central paradox of the prize 
festival, which celebrates the interior work of writing 
while parading writers in front of cheering crowds who 
have somehow identified with that introspection. For 
Als, writing is not about winning recognition but rather 
about “a kind of longing to communicate something to 
myself.” If that’s writing, then, I asked him, what’s the 
point of literary prizes?

“That’s for others to say,” he replied. “If they’re going 
to be nice enough to give you something, you should 
just take it and be gracious about it. I think art is self-de­
termining, and whoever gets to weigh in is welcome to, 
but it shouldn’t shape who you are or your goals.”

When Aminatta Forna received her $150,000 check, 
she bought gifts for people who had helped her during 
years of writing for little recognition and pay: crates of 
wine for a generous web designer, a nice dinner for a 
friend who had done Forna a favor. That the money 
didn’t fundamentally alter Forna’s lifestyle may be a 
sign of the prize’s success. After the happy surprise of 
receiving the award, after the glitz and glamour of the 
festival, the winners return home. Buoyed by the tangi­
ble benefit of cash, and the knowledge of other people’s 
high expectations, they continue to write.
