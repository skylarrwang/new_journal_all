EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Welcome to Phelps Gate. I found out during our train­
ing that Phelps Gate is the official entrance to Yale Col­
lege. This is misleading, because Yale is everywhere. 
Except for right behind you. This is the New Haven 
Green. The Green was the center square of the original 
nine-square plan. That’s right, New Haven was the first 
planned city in America. This is ironic, because if New 
Haven was so great at planning, then how is it possible I 
grew up on a street that was one-way in both directions? 
Riddle me that, tourists!


A couple fun facts about the Green: first, it was orig­
inally a cemetery, since John Davenport built the Green 
around Center Church, and the Puritans believed that 
burying their dead around a church would help God find 
their souls. There are actually thousands of bodies buried 
under the Green. The city preserved some of the more 
prominent families’ gravestones in the a crypt beneath 
Center Church. The rest of the stones were stolen or 
relocated to the Grove Street Cemetery. When a bolt of 
lightning felled an oak tree on the Green during 2012’s 
Hurricane Sandy, a human skeleton was found tangled in 
the roots, its mouth open. 


Second, the New Haven Green is not actually owned 
by the City of New Haven. It’s owned by the Commit­
tee of the Proprietors of Common and Undivided Lands 
at New Haven, a private group with an unwieldy name, 
composed of the descendants of the New Haven colony’s 
original seven landholders. This wasn’t much of an issue 
until 2011, when New Haven’s branch of Occupy Wall 
Street set up shop on the Green. When the New Haven 
Police tried to remove the occupation, protestors took the 
City to court, arguing the City didn’t have the right to 
remove them from the Committee’s land. While Occupy 
ultimately lost the case and had to relocate camp, this lit­
tle loophole helped Occupy New Haven become the lon­
gest lasting occupation in the Northeast. With our per­
fect storm of college students, free-spirited liberals, and 
a booming homeless population, Occupy New Haven was 
the spot to be for a solid eight months. Plus protesting 
the 1 percent was always more fun than attending high 
school. Again, not that I would know from firsthand 
experience because I cherish rules.
