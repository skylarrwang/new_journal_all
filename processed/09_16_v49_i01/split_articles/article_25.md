I began consuming Soylent 2.0 this April, three 
months after I learned about it online. Soylent 2.0 is a 
meal replacement beverage created by Rob Rhinehart, 
who marketed his product in 2013 by eating nothing but 
Soylent for 30 days and blogging about the experience. 
The idea of a liquid diet fascinated me. It was almost 
unbelievable that Soylent had all the nutrients my body 
needed. I’d be able to throw a few bottles in my backpack 
and forget about the dining halls. I would have more time 
to sleep and do homework. If I liked Soylent, I thought, 
living off campus next year would be a breeze, since 
I wouldn’t have to worry about cooking or shopping for 
food. 	

Even so, the name Soylent didn’t sit quite right with 
me. Hearing it, all I could think of was the famous line 
in the 1973 sci-fi film Soylent Green: “Soylent Green is 
people!” Detective Thorne, the film’s hero, screams the 
words as he discovers a secret that the Soylent Corpo­
ration doesn’t want the world to know: Soylent Green, 
the food substitute that most of New York City’s resi­
dents rely on for their survival, is made out of human 
beings. Why would Rhinehart name his meal replace­
ment Soylent?

Rhinehart’s Soylent isn’t made from people—ingre­
dients include filtered water, maltodextrin, soy protein 
isolate, high oleic algal oil, isomaltulose, canola oil, 
rice starch, oat fiber, isomaltooligosaccharide, and soy 
lecithin. The macronutrient ratio is 33:47:20, which 
means 33 percent of calories come from carbohydrates, 47 percent from lipids, and 20 percent from proteins. 
There are four Soylent products on the market: Soylent 
1.6, a powder; Soylent 2.0, a bottled drink; Coffeeist, a 
caffeinated Soylent 2.0; and Soylent Bar, a snack bar 
with a salted caramel flavor. The sleek white bottle of 
Soylent 2.0 has a black cap and displays two pieces of 
information in black, sans-serif font: soylent. 400 kcal. 
Assuming you’re a normal American, you need 2,000 
daily kcal, which means all you need to do to keep 
typing lines of code 24/7/365 is drink five bottles of 
Soylent 2.0 each day. 

I decided to ignore my concerns and judge the drink 
itself. At the time I was taking a class on sustainable 
food and agriculture, and for my final project, the Yale 
Sustainable Food Program granted me $400 to pur­
chase all the bottles I needed to survive for thirty days. 
To test Rhinehart’s claim that Soylent is nutritionally 
complete, my diet was 100 percent liquid Soylent, 0 
percent chewable. There were concessions I wasn’t 
willing to make for the duration, like giving up cof­
fee and staying completely away from the dining hall. 
Once a day or so I sipped burnt black coffee as my 
friends sated their appetites with chicken tenders and 
hard-boiled eggs. But for the most part, I took meals 
alone, in my dorm room and during breaks between 
classes.

As I grew accustomed to the tan, thick, and bland 
liquid, which conceals its true textural nature—sandpa­
per—until it reaches the esophagus, I was increasingly
