THE  NEW  JOURNAL
for women of color. 
Sororities, often seen as bastions of race and class 
privilege, were no exception. All four of the sorori­
ties—Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma, and newcomer Alpha Phi—held chapter-wide 
conversations, and Yale’s Panhellenic Council, com­prised of representatives from all the sororities, held 
an open forum just before recruitment that sought to 
establish new diversification initiatives regarding race 
and income. 

Attendees broke into small groups where they dis­
cussed big questions: How could they make sororities 
more accessible? What role should they play as a group 
of women in discussions about racial justice? How 
should they be better allies to women of color?

Lauren Weston, a member of Pi Phi who graduated 
in 2016 and who is also Black, echoed Harris’s senti­
ment that she hadn’t initially anticipated the sorority to 
be especially racially inclusive. “I never came to Yale 
expecting my sorority to be this all-encompassing entity 
that would support me as a marginalized person,” she 
told me. “I didn’t expect it to go out of its way to include 
people of color, because most places don’t do that.”

Increasingly, however, students at Yale and across the 
country are asking for exactly that. In the Yale College 
Council Greek Life Task Force Report, released this 
past May, students of color in focus groups “explained 
that due to the homogeneity of much of Greek life, 
they are often not only at a disadvantage during recruit­
ment, but are also vulnerable to feelings of discomfort 
and exclusion.” The report called on Greek organiza­
tions to have honest conversations about the degree to 
which their membership reflects campus at large. 

At Yale, exclusivity, reputation, and hierarchy per­
vade aspects of student life from seminars to senior 
societies, and sororities are no exception. Pi Phi and 
Theta members sometimes speak frankly about the 
general campus perception that they particularly attract 
privileged women; Theta member and junior Sophie 
Freeman described Theta’s campus reputation as “rich 
bitches.” Pi Phi and Theta offer their members entrée 
to a particular sliver of the Yale social scene, one that 
blooms around High Street frats and at glitzy formals 
that yield a slew of similar Facebook profile photos. 

I spoke to past and present members of Pi Phi and 
Theta about their ability to provide communities, safe 
spaces, and platforms for Yale women. At a university 
where students continue to engage in heated and often 
painful debates about institutional inclusivity, the 
question is: Which women?

ing straightening irons and eyelash curlers, rummag­
ing through roommates’ closets for the perfect top, and 
finally pouring out of dorms into the barely-plowed 
streets. Many walk in high-heeled boots, huddling 
close together for warmth in the second-semester cold. 
They hope to join a tradition that stretches back more 
than a century. 

As Jessica Bennett noted in  last spring’s piece in The 
New York Times, “When a Feminist Pledges a Sorority,” 
sororities began in the nineteenth century with the mis­
sion of helping young women navigate hostile co-ed 
institutions. Some early sorority members were active 
in the suffragette movement, and the groups served as 
organizing spaces for women seeking social, academic, 
and professional support. Kappa Alpha Theta came 
to Yale in 1986, less than twenty years after Yale Col­
lege accepted women in 1969. Kappa and Pi Phi fol­
lowed in 1987 and 1989, respectively. When Theta was 
founded, it was the only sorority on Yale’s campus, in 
some ways following in the footsteps of the early twen­
tieth century groups by serving as an alternative to all-
male fraternities and secret societies.

But while sororities are meant to offer refuge to 
female students, they don’t always become more inclu­
sive as student bodies become more diverse. As Ben­
nett points out, many sororities responded to an influx 
of first Jewish students, and then students of color, 
by tightening their recruitment process, safeguarding 
their privilege and, often, their whiteness. Their his­
tories share something with the American feminist 
movement: wealthy, educated white women struggled 
for equality with white men, holding onto what power 
they had while excluding large numbers of low-income 
women and women of color.   

Skyler Inman, director of the Yale College Council’s 
Greek Life Task Force and president of Alpha Phi, said 
that sororities and fraternities have been at the “van­
guard of tradition in a very negative way in a lot of 
places.” 

Today, Yale’s sororities are reckoning with that his­
tory. Some sorority sisters, like their early founders, 
want their organizations to be homes for political activ­
ism and platforms from which they can effect change. 
Unlike the first sorority members, many hope their 
organizations can one day provide a supportive com­
munity for all women. 

The recruitment process, where each member’s rela­
tionship with her sorority begins, is an example of how 
unquestioned traditions can create barriers to access. 
But relatively small changes in these traditions could 
have a big impact on the composition of the group. 
In most sororities, the executive board turns over right 
before the rush process, so deliberating over a new class 
is any new president’s first opportunity to make major 
decisions. It’s the entry point for diversification. As sev­
eral women made clear to me, it’s where you would 
start if you wanted to change things. 

The culture of recruitment is such that some peo­
ple may feel they must arrive ready to talk about their 
prep schools or summer homes, according to Nat 
Wyatt, a Theta, and Diana, a member of the Theta 
executive board. (Diana requested to be identified 
by a pseudonym after corresponding with the group’s 
international organization about this piece.) Some of 
this atmosphere comes from old reputation, but some 
comes from modern practice.

Before the actual rush process starts, Pi Phis and 
Thetas have traditionally had the opportunity to alert 
their sisters to friends and family who may be rushing. 
Facebook profiles were projected on a screen in the Pi 
Phi or Theta house, during a sort of unofficial pre-re­
cruitment presentation. It is a tradition that allows 
women to give people they already know—often peo­
ple similar to them—a small advantage. 

Weston described the practice as “fifteen minutes of 
Greenwich, Connecticut girls.”

At the Panhellenic meeting in November, practices 
like the pre-recruitment slideshow faced criticism. 
Many of the most concrete suggestions for change con­
cerned rush. One proposal was that sororities be more 
transparent about finances during the recruitment 
process. In the past, the Panhellenic Council has man­
dated that sororities not specify their exact dues during 
recruitment. Instead, the Council gives a pre-recruit­
ment presentation to women rushing, which depicts a 
range of dues. A Panhellenic Council member said the 
dues typically range from $300 to $500 per semester; 
she declined to provide information about each soror­
ity’s specific dues. 

“They don’t want us going up to girls and saying, 
‘Well, Kappa is…cheaper than Theta.’ They don’t want 
us influencing girls in that way,” Carly Huard, a mem­
ber of Kappa, told me. She recounted an instance last 
winter in which a woman rushing found out another 
sorority’s more expensive dues and decided to with­
draw from recruitment. Huard told me the woman had 
assumed all the sororities had equally expensive dues 
and that she couldn’t afford to be in any of them. 

“Maybe the concern is that people will start segregat­
ing themselves by income,” Huard told me, “but what 
happens is people who think they can’t afford it just 
drop out anyway.” 

The Panhellenic Council disagreed. They decided 
they’d continue to run that first meeting themselves, 
but stressed that “each sorority had an obligation to 
explain their financial situation at some point during

recruitment,” Diana explained. For some, it presented 
an opportunity for a turning point—the chance to 
speak candidly to potential members about the finan­
cial burdens of sorority life. For others, the lack of a 
clear directive from the Council opened the door to 
continued obfuscation about dues. “To what extent it 
was explained was sort of up to the group,” Diana said. 
The Council’s decision put the burden of change in 
the hands of individual sororities rather than address­
ing it at a systemic level.


When Jéssica Leão rushed Theta, it was for one main 
reason: “I had heard Theta was number one, and that’s 
why I joined it basically,” Leão, who became president 
of Theta in 2015, told me nonchalantly, flipping a lock 
of her dark brown hair over her shoulder. She was walk­
ing with difficulty, on crutches after a recent accident, 
but wore a tight crop-top and shorts to our interview.

Leão, who graduated in May, may have joined Theta 
because of its elite reputation, but she quickly realized 
there was much she didn’t share with many of the other 
members. 

“I’m from Brazil, I’m from Latin America, my parents 
don’t speak English, I’m a QuestBridge Scholar here,” 
Leão told me, explaining that she had personal reasons 
for wanting Theta to be a more inclusive organization. 
In 2014, she ran for president to effect those changes 
herself. “I was, I guess, particularly good at assimilating 
into white spaces and rich spaces,” she said.

As president of the sorority in 2015, she tackled 
recruitment as the first challenge. 

“I feel like when I went through recruitment, people 
were like, ‘Oh my god, I love your shirt, I love your ear­
rings,’ and we were like, ‘Don’t make this about materi­
alism,’” she said. She wanted the group to instead focus 
on the interests of those pledging. “What we were look­
ing for was people who were really engaged and pas­
sionate about something and leaders in their own right, 
and not pretty girls, basically.” She says the class she 
recruited as president was “incredibly diverse.” Accord­
ing to Theta’s executive board, thirty-five percent of the 
new members initiated in January 2016 are women of 
color, compared to roughly twenty percent of the class 
initiated in 2014. 

Theta members I spoke to insist that Leão’s efforts 
have redefined their sorority. Diana points to Leão’s 
presence as a Latina sorority president as a huge shift 
in and of itself. 

What started with Leão’s discussions last year has 
grown into a revamping of some of Theta’s traditions. 
The sorority now has a speaker series that includes lec­
tures on the prison-industrial complex. Last year, they 
held a fundraising drive for the Flint Water Fund that 
caused Yale’s NAACP representative Brea Baker, who 
graduated in 2015, to say she was surprised Theta had 
participated in such an initiative.  

Most significant, however, seems to be Theta’s new 
financial aid plan. Like most sororities, Theta’s national 
chapter offered competitive scholarships for academic 
costs, such as books and tuition, but no assistance for 
paying dues. This year’s executive board wanted to 
change that. 

Diana told me she thought about asking alums, cur­
rent members, and members’ parents for funds to sup­
port scholarships, though doing so without permission 
from the international organization would be against 
its policies. According to Liz Rinck of Theta’s interna­
tional staff, restrictions from the Internal Revenue Ser­
vice prohibit raising money for individual members. 
Despite the restrictions, Diana said, the chapter 
began fundraising in November. “I wasn’t hiding it 
from [internationals],” she told me, “I just didn’t con­
sult them.” 

Freeman has a different take: “I don’t think our 
financial aid program is legal technically,” she told 
me. “We didn’t want to ask [internationals] because we 
were pretty sure they’d say no. So they’re not super sup­
portive of that, which seems racist to me, and classist.”

Diana eventually broke the news to the international 
Theta organization, who explained that if they depos­
ited the money for safe-keeping with an alumni orga­
nization instead of retaining the rights to dispense it 
themselves, they wouldn’t be breaking the anti-fund­
raising rules. Diana continued fundraising over winter 
break, eventually raising five thousand dollars from 
alumni and parents. Their financial aid program is 
currently supporting twenty percent of the 2016 pledge 
class.

Celeste Dushime, a current Theta and member of 
last year’s pledge class, is one of the new members 
using Theta’s financial aid plan. Dushime is from 
Rwanda and identifies as queer. In “old” Theta, she 
would be an anomaly. “New” Theta insists she exem­
plifies a growing wave of change.

When I asked Dushime if she thought the sororities 
had been transparent about dues during recruitment, 
she told me Theta was the most straightforward, which 
led to her choice to join. She reiterated that dues and 
financial aid were “the first thing that they talked 
about” at the first recruitment event. 

Wyatt is in Dushime’s Theta pledge class, and as far 
as they know they are the only non-binary person in all 
of Yale Greek life. They mentioned Theta’s financial 
aid program as a reason why they joined. “I thought 
this could be fun, this could be interesting, but I was 
like, man…I don’t know if I can put my name with
