In an antechamber on the second floor of the Quinnip­
iack Club, a block from the New Haven Green, a group 
of mostly white adults mingles. One grey-haired, bespec­
tacled gentleman chuckles in khakis and a sport coat. A 
middle-woman in capris and Asics sizes up the thirty-per­
son crowd. Another woman, grinning and alone in an 
all-turquoise sweat suit, could easily be somebody’s grand­
mother. When Emily, an actor in a pinstripe skirt suit, 
enters through a pair of heavy wooden doors with a clip­
board, Turquoise Grandma is the first to get in line.  

She passes through the antechamber into the oaken 
Club Library, where the shelved books look worn but 
staged, as if purchased en masse. In one corner, a dig­
ital clock reads “1:30:00” in apocalyptic red digits. An 
air conditioner hums in the center window. Both chill 
the otherwise stuffy atmosphere.

Alice—another actor identical to Emily in manner 
and dress—waits just inside to welcome the crowd into 
the wood-paneled room. In dignified Queen’s English, 
Alice asks Turquoise Grandma: “Benefactor or Silent 
Witness?”
“Benefactor,” she says.	
“Thank you for your contribution. You are now a 
Player,” Alice responds, seating her accordingly. 

Players are arranged in one of four rows of com­
manding, green leather chairs, two along each side 
of the long wooden table at the center of the musty 
library, while Silent Witnesses sit in the four rows of 
folding chairs perpendicular to the action. Once the 
Players and Witnesses have been segregated, Alice 
explains the rules and emergency exit procedures with 
the sterile friendliness of a flight attendant, down to the 
open-palm hand gestures and ascot. Emily waits by the 
beverage cart. (There will be free wine after.)

The Benefactors have ninety minutes to unanimously 
decide—via signed contract—how to spend their $300 
of that evening’s gross ticket revenue. (Benefactors pay 
$20 while Silent Witnesses pay $35, perhaps to encour­
age participants.) The Silent Witnesses silently witness, 
unless they ring a brass bell and cough up an additional 
$20 for a seat at the table and, thus, a voice. Benefac­
tors can tap out, too, to the resonant chime of a small 
gong on a side table. Should the group of Benefactors 
fail to allocate their funds unanimously in the time 
allotted by the clock counting down in the corner, the 
entire pile of cash turns over to the next day’s council.

This semi-parliamentary pomp and circumstance 
constitutes The Money, an interactive theatrical expe­
rience imported from British production company 
Kaleider and performed daily for a full week beginning 
on June 18 for New Haven’s annual International Festi­
val of Arts and Ideas. The show, or game, or simulated 
oligarchy, is equal parts artful theater and social exper­
iment, though the project’s conceiver and Kaleider’s 
Artistic Director, Seth Honnor, insists he feels no 
moral or ethical obligation as to how the money should 
be spent. Despite the fact that every group of Bene­
factors present in New Haven for The Money’s American 
premiere unanimously voted to support a charitable 
cause, Honnor appreciates those rare and brave sugges­
tions that veer towards self-interest. 

But as electric red seconds tick away on the clock 
and the cash leers expectantly at the donors, “frivol­
ity”—as one woman labeled self-serving expenditures 
like bar tabs and free pizza—finds no place at the table. 
One woman anted up on Friday’s show with an offer to 
match ten dollars a head if she could keep half the new 
total and invest in a Colorado marijuana farm. (The 
original total was $420.) Other players shouted her 
down before pausing to do the math. 

Honnor said the responsibility he forced on Bene­
factors kept him up at night. But nobody’s forcing any­
thing on anyone, of course; it’s all a game that people 
have paid to attend. It’s an immersive work of theatrical 
art, one in which the actors’ desire to demonstrate their 
moral rectitude by advocating for the worthiest charita­
ble cause feels similar to the performances of generos­
ity staged by major philanthropists: Mark Zuckerberg, 
for example, announced his $100 million donation to 
Newark Public Schools on the Oprah Show. The trick 
of the production is that the participants don’t seem to 
realize that they’re acting. 

“Everything we do in that space is elastic, but there’s 
nothing that’s not considered,” Honnor notes, from the 
vaguely suggestive language of the tabletop Rule Book 
(the qualification that Players should be “visionary” 
was added mid-run in New Haven), to Alice’s seating
