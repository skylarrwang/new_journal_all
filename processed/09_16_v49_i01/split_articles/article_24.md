Though New Haven experienced growth during the 
war, by the nineteen-fifties, urban decline set in as res­
idents flocked to the suburbs and factory after factory 
shut its doors. In 2006, the Winchester Repeating Arms 
Factory was one of the last of the factories to shut down 
its giant assembly lines. The plant had once employed 
upwards of fifteen thousand people; its closing marked 
the end of an industrial era.

The “Made in New Haven” campaign aims to high­
light the small businesses that have emerged in the 
wake of the city’s industrial collapse. But the partici­
pants consist of include t-shirt printers, independent 
video game designers, and restaurateurs—small shops 
standing that stand in stark contrast to the huge employ­
ers that sustained New Haven’s economy for much of 
the twentieth century. Those factories provided jobs, 
supported families, and fostered a community identity 
for the city. Should we be expecting tangible economic 
results from a campaign centered around boutique 
businesses? Does New Haven need a government-sanc­
tioned sticker to reaffirm its local identity?

—
Mark Sincavage, one of the family members who 
co-owns Skappo Restaurant and Skappo Merkato, is 
selling a line of sandwich spreads in Big Y supermar­
kets with the “Made in New Haven” logo attached. He 
stands behind the spread counter proudly wearing the 
family polo shirt, waving often at friends and commu­
nity members out the window.  His father is from New 
Haven originally, and his grandfather had a small gro­
cery store on Dwight Street in the early seventies.
“You know, it’s not just Brooklyn that’s the only 
neighborhood that’s creating interesting products,” he 
says. “[In New Haven], you meet the people that are 
working on it, that are getting their hands dirty, that 
are creating, that are networking. I think it could work 
inside out: Like let’s establish ourselves first, let’s create 
a bond and community of people.”

For Sincavage, “Made in America” is simply too big.  
Big corporations can claim they are “Made in Amer­
ica,” appealing to shoppers’ patriotic sensibilities while 
concealing the fact that the label could mean “made 
two thousand miles away.” Being made in New Haven 
means being made by “small people, by small busi­
nesses.”  

Of course, a small business like Skappo doesn’t have 
the capacity to employ thousands of people or sustain 
a whole city’s economy as the Winchester Repeating 
Arms Factory once did. Skappo has just three employ­
ees, and the “Made in New Haven” list features very 
few such industrial production centers. Fiber optics 
manufacturer Radiall and aerospace contractor Space-
Craft were included in the launch only as advisors, not 
participants, and the pharmaceutical company Alex­
ion, which moved to New Haven last year and brought 
with it twelve hundred new jobs, was not listed. 

“Made in New Haven,” though, is neither equipped 
nor intended to fill this economic hole; instead, it’s 
using the language of production to rekindle a sense 
of former glory. For Sincavage, it seems to be the 
small-business owner’s anthem: the launching of com­
munity, perhaps even an attempt to escape New Hav­
en’s past problems through enterprise and sweat.

When the city announced the “Made in New 
Haven” campaign this May, the program was only 
thinly defined. It featured online promotions for busi­
nesses, community networking, and a newly designed 
logo for product packaging, but it was unclear if the 
city had any concrete goals beyond boosting spirit. 
Fashion designer, business owner, and “Made in New 
Haven” participant Neville Wisdom displays the logo 
in his shop window, but he says that besides the sticker, 
the campaign organizers haven’t yet “talked [with him] 
about anything specific in terms of a collaboration.”  
The campaign’s graphic designer Kelly Bigelow Bec­
erra told the New Haven Independent that she drew 
inspiration for the logo from New Haven’s own design 
history, choosing a border that once lined the 1845 
Postmaster’s Provisional stamps. The botanical look—
two Elm trees standing on opposite, shrubby shores, 
with running water in between—is meant to market 
New Haven as a “place where innovators come to be 
mindful.”

But this tranquil scene does not carry the feeling of 
other origin labels, like the iconic “Made in the U.S.A.” 
mark, which seems to radiate pride through its patriotic 
stripes. The “Made in New Haven” sticker lacks any 
real indication of New Haven’s economic history or 
potential. The city just looks calm.

Matthew Nemerson, the city’s Economic Develop­
ment Administrator and a key player in economic strat­
egies like the “Made in New Haven” campaign, doesn’t 
envision the project changing New Haven’s economy 
drastically, but rather increasing city morale. At the 
very least, he told me, it couldn’t hurt.
“People forget history and don’t have a good sense of 
the past,” he says. “It would surprise people today, but at 
the World Columbian Expo in Chicago [in 1893], we 
had one of the largest displays. What other city would 
have won the prize for best hardware, best horse drawn 
carriage, best rifle innovation?” Those prizes, though, 
aren’t attached to New Haven’s name New Haven like 
automobiles are to Detroit. 

Elinor Slomba, a New Haven entrepreneur, sees 
“Made in New Haven” less as a way to bolster big com­
panies or famed products and more as a way to export 
“a perception of New Haven as a place where creative 
people can be supported and can realize their ideas.” 
Slomba is the founder and CEO of Art Interstices, a 
company that creates opportunities to unite creative 
arts and entrepreneurs, and is the current head of 
Project Storefronts.  The campaign is partially piggy­
backing off of the success of Project Storefronts’ 2009 
program to fill vacant commercial space, or even spe­
cial sections of occupied space, with pop-up concepts 
that are usually artistically inspired. To that end, the 
“Made” “Made in New Haven” campaign also includes 
producers of digital design and media goods as well as 
physical products. 

Nemerson doesn’t care what it the goal is as long as it 
boosts prosperity within the city. In the late nineteenth 
and early-to-mid twentieth century, “New Haven had 
agents in Europe—Italy, Germany—literally signing 
people up, bringing people, whole families, to a manu­
facturing center of the world,” he says. “We can’t recre­
ate that, but we can recreate the ideal. It shouldn’t be 
surprising that people would move their business here, 
that we would make something.”  

A company that exemplifies Nemerson’s ideal—a 
company that makes something on a relatively large 
scale with world renown—is Vespoli, a producer of 
crew racing shells. With roughly forty employees, the 
company produces between three hundred and three 
hundred sixty 360 boats per year, selling them all over 
the country and internationally, as far away as Japan, 
for anywhere from eight thousand to forty thousand 
dollars per boat. 

Dave Trond, Vice President of Sales for Vespoli, 
described that the sense of community that New Haven 
businesses provide (“if we need a new roof, a Connecti­
cut company does it for us”), but also the sense of pride 
in holding out as a “last stronghold” of the heavier 
manufacturing of the city’s past. Vespoli has long been 
a subscriber to the “Made in America” movement, and 
their boats will now feature a “Made in New Haven” 
sticker prominently alongside the older seal.

Founded in Hamden in 1980 before moving to New 
Haven in 1987, Vespoli has seen a lot of changes in 
the Elm City. Trond himself arrived about twenty-five 
years ago, after growing up in Pennsylvania and coach­
ing crew at the University of Massachusetts, though he 
“never thought [he’d] move to New Haven in a million 
years.”  

Today, he is even more impressed with the city’s cos­
mopolitan spirit and its reputation as the new “restau­
rant destination of New England.” This is good because, 
as Trond pointed out, Vespoli probably couldn’t leave 
even if it wanted to. When we spoke in June, the com­
pany was only about a week removed from its first anni­
versary of transitioning into an employee-owned com­
pany.  And with all of its new shareholders—employees 
and their families living in and around New Haven—
Vespoli has intertwined itself within the fabric of the 
city, fully tied to its economy. 

According to Sincavage, the co-owner of Skappo, 
there is a poem by Saint Francis that reads something 
along the lines of “No man can escape the inevitability 
of death.” Maybe the same applies here. “Made in New 
Haven” isn’t an antithesis to “Made in the USA” but 
rather an expression of the post-industrial city, reborn: 
We are still here, and, like our grandfathers before us, 
we are still building things. Not necessarily things of 
steel, but of community, of originality, and always with 
our hands.
