**Title: VII. THE YALE BOOKSTORE**
**Author: Sophie Dillon**
**Page number(s): 14**

And now our tour must come to an end, conveniently 
located by a store where you can buy all sorts of Y-em­
blazoned stuff for three times what it’s worth. Or you can 
find a nice book, read it in the store, and then put it back 
on the shelf with a few friendly dog-ears for the next time 
you want to visit. If anybody wants lunch, you can buy 
a fourteen-dollar salad at Claire’s Cornercopia Corner 
Copia, or you can steal an iced tea from Gourmet Heaven, 
climb a fire escape, and see how many phalluses you can 
find in the Gothic architecture. First one to thirty wins!

**Title: VI. OLD CAMPUS**
**Author: VI.**

This real-life brochure in front of you is called Old 
Campus. Those two sturdy boys playing catch over there 
are not, in fact, being paid to do so by Yale Admissions. 
Apparently some people just like to play catch for fun! 
You really do meet all kinds of people in college.


That statue over there is Nathan Hale, who is famous 
for being a crap spy. The man volunteered to collect intel­
ligence on the Brits by posing as a Dutch schoolteacher 
during the Revolutionary War, and was caught after 
only a few weeks. He was hanged with a Bible and a Yale 
diploma in hand, prompting his famous last words: “Cs 
get degrees, but degrees don’t get you much when you’re 
getting hanged for treason.” 


Also this isn’t really a statue of Nathan Hale, since no 
one could find a picture of him when Yale decided to make 
the honorary statue in 1914. Instead, the Administration 
lined up the Yale class Class of 1914 and chose the most 
patriotic-looking man for the mold.


The bigger statue by that tree is Theodore Dwight 
Woolsey, the only president of a northern university to 
not send southern students home during the Civil War. 
There’s a story about how his toe is lucky, so people rub 
it for good luck, but don’t be fooled—that toe is more 
golden with student urine than with luck. This isn’t just a 
Yale tradition. Harvard similarly has a big statue of John 
Harvard with a toe that tourists rub for luck and students 
relieve themselves on for laughs. Oh, the Ivy League!


Of course, that one’s not really a statue of John Har­
vard either, and John Harvard didn’t even found Harvard. 
That’s sort of how this whole thing works, if you hav­
en’t figured it out already. Someone builds something on 
somebody else’s land, and later it gets named after a bene­
factor with nebulous ties to the building. And that’s how 
tradition is made, folks.
