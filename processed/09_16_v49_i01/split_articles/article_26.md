**Title: A Thirty-Day Soylent Experiment**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I drank Soylent for thirty days. I was completely disinterested in consuming it. I lost thirteen pounds. 
I didn’t ever feel very hungry or very tired. Instead I 
had a consistent hum of energy from half past nine to 
just after midnight. I had ample time for classwork. 
I recorded my “average mood” each day, which was 
usually slightly negative or neutral. When I decided to 
free-associate with the word Soylent on day six, I wrote 
down control, serialization, and crazy. On day thirteen 
I wrote down diarrhea. In my Excel spreadsheet I cre­
ated a column for writing down other notes, and the 
most common word in that column was alone. The sec­
ond most common word was frustration.

Four bottles a day—10:30 am, 1:30 pm, 4:30 pm, 
and 7:30 pm—was my rhythm. It was four-on-the-floor 
energy, no more and no less than what I needed. I like 
to make electronic music, and without explicit inten­
tion everything I made while on Soylent was around 
one hundred beats per minute with a kick drum on 
quarter notes, the sort of commercial groove that leaves 
you longing for something with soul.

At 1:30 pm, truly on the dot—I remember check­
ing the time on my iPhone—while walking back from 
a logic class, I slipped on early spring ice outside the 
C.E.I.D. Perfectly on schedule, I had an open, chilled 
bottle of my chalky Soylent in hand, which I was sip­
ping slowly. I must have spilled 40 calories or so, and I 
remember thinking I had made an irrevocable mistake. 
My mind shot straight to the boxes of Soylent in my 
dorm room, to the fear of being hungry right around 
11:30 pm that night, to the questions of whether, now 
40 kcal short of my thirty-day caloric need calcula­
tion—two thousand per day times thirty—I would 
be slightly undernourished, and whether I was doing 
myself psychological harm by experimenting with this 
crazy liquid food. To my horror, I made eye contact 
with a student walking the other way on my right. She 
glanced in disgust at the slimy gray puddle I had cre­
ated. This happened on day seven, April 4.

In my journal I often wrote that relationships with 
my friends were beginning to frustrate me. During 
that month, I thought it was because I had time away 
from the dining halls to lie on my navy blue duvet, 
look through my ceiling’s dusty skylight-on-a-slant, and 
think clearly about Big Questions. I spent hours and 
hours in that position, ignoring text messages, feel­
ing anonymous, turning food cravings into nagging 
self-doubt. Pre-April I was spending that time in din­
ing halls, laughing over chicken nuggets and Brussels 
sprouts with the very friends I would soon complain 
about in April’s journal entries.

But there is a better explanation. Soylent came up in 
conversation time and time again: what it tasted like, 
whether it was a life hack, how my digestion was. Those 
conversations, the brief kind you have with more casual 
friends, got old for me and my closer friends. “Let me 
guess—you’re talking about Soylent again,” was the 
biting remark that reminded me not to talk about my 
experience, my foray into the so-called future of food, 
too dull to dwell on. Someone in particular said that 
to me a few times, granted, but routinely I said it to 
myself. 

Soylent 2.0, the latest and greatest, is ideology. Sub­
sume the urge to eat and the joy of sharing a meal 
under obstacles to productivity. Stamp out the tiresome 
clatter of cooking from your busy and important life. 
Free yourself to do the things that actually matter faster 
and better than ever before. But do always remember: 
your productivity is an end in and of itself. You will get 
very hungry indeed if you notice that you’re all alone 
and you forget why you’re in such a rush. The black-
and-white, less-is-more of Soylent offers no answer to 
that question. It won’t engage you in dialogue, the way 
the friends you used to eat with did. Sure, Soylent 2.0 
is no Soylent Green. It isn’t made out of human beings. 
But it has a different secret. It will control you. It will 
empty you. And it will isolate you, too. I lived on it for a 
month of my life, sipping, digesting, and ridding myself 
of the very life forces that food should sustain.
