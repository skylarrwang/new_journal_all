EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The black bear’s mother kicked him out of her den 
in northwestern Connecticut when he was seventeen 
months old, the equivalent of a human preteen. It was 
May 2016, she was ready to mate again, and black bears 
don’t usually hang around while their mothers prepare 
for new cubs. He had no resources, no skills, nowhere to 
go—just a nose for food and a desire to find females. Bears 
are a solitary and territorial species, and no one was try­
ing to help him, either. If the bear entered his mother’s 
territory, she would chase him away. Every suitable habi­
tat he found in the nearby woodlands seemed to be taken 
already by one of his standoffish kind. Some of his peers 
had given up on their crowded quadrant and journeyed 
far, reaching upstate New York, Long Island, and New 
Jersey. But this one wandered beyond the woods. 

Wallace Street, New Haven: a quiet block in the 
Cedar Hill neighborhood near Wooster Square, over­
grown with weeds that sprout from cracks in the side­
walk and crawl into the wooded grove that separates 
the street from I-91. It’s a street only two blocks long, 
where small auto-parts warehouses give way to modest 
clapboard houses between Grand Avenue and Jocelyn 
Square. Residents hose down their cars in the after­
noon there, or lounge in beach chairs on their lawns 
when the weather is nice. What they don’t do, gener­
ally, is hide behind dumpsters and call for friends to 
pick them up—which is exactly what Wallace Street 
resident Tonya Hall did on May 9, when she spotted 
the lone adolescent bear in the grove near the highway. 
“He was just walking along, and then he looked at 
me, and I was like, ‘Oh, shoot, a bear!’” Hall told the 
New Haven Register at the time of the incident. Fellow 
Wallace Street resident Oziel Melendez also saw him 
in his own backyard, and chased him out. The bear 
eventually ran up a tree, and a cluster of perturbed 
neighbors formed. The neighbors’ agitation upgraded 
the bear’s appearance from “sighting” to “contact,” and 
required the assistance of the Wildlife Division of the 
Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmen­
tal Protection (DEEP), whose staffers shot the bear 
with a tranquilizer dart and removed it from the imme­
diate area. By the end of the day no one was hurt, and 
the bear, safely released into the nearest forested area, 
had been nicknamed Boo-Boo by the neighbors. 

Residents of Connecticut’s more forested towns 
would scoff at any commotion over a single bear in 
the neighborhood. In Avon, which sits on the edge 
of Talcott Mountain State Park in the north of the

state, there have been 580 black bear sightings since 
August 2015 alone. But in New Haven, a bear sight­
ing is highly unusual. Luckily, Wallace Street seems 
unshaken: when I visited this July and asked residents 
on the block if they had heard of the recent bear 
sightings in the area, the replies were either “No” or 
“There’s a bear?!” But Boo-Boo’s brief New Haven tour 
represented a growing trend: people are spotting more 
bears in more areas of the state, including cities. There 
have already been 5,100 sightings in Connecticut this 
year, compared with 4,496 in all of 2015 and 3,003 
in 2010. There have been eight in New Haven since 
2010—one in 2011, one in 2015, and six this year. 
“This has been a big year for human-bear conflict,” 
says Jason Hawley, a black bear biologist with DEEP. 
A mere sighting isn’t a conflict, he adds; there has to 
be some sort of direct, negative interaction between 
the bear and the human. Paranoid city dwellers might 
immediately assume Hawley is talking about attacks, 
which do occur, albeit very rarely. Just this past June, a 
woman finishing a marathon survived a bear mauling 
in a nature preserve near Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
But Hawley is referring to less grisly conflicts, ones 
that consist of bears rifling through a family’s trash, 
say, or killing livestock, or charging at someone and 
then running up a tree. While these sorts of encounters 
certainly aren’t innocuous, they don’t often happen in 
Connecticut. DEEP tranquilized and relocated only 
fifteen bears this year out of nearly five thousand sight­
ings, making Boo-Boo’s a special case. Hawley says that 
incidents like the one on Wallace Street in May will 
only become more frequent. Why?

Much of Connecticut’s farmland has turned back 
to woodland in the past one hundred years due to the 
growth of industrial farming in other states and federal 
efforts to restore American forests. Black bears, sud­
denly sitting on a state full of suitable habitat, have 
expanded their statewide population to about seven 
hundred and ventured beyond their traditional north­
western quadrant. More unsettlingly, black bears are 
virtually indestructible. “Black bears have a survival 
rate of eighty percent,” says Hawley. “That’s unheard of 
for a wild animal. There are places where the human 
survival rate isn’t even that high.” Bears owe their suc­
cess to their low birth rate and solitary nature: their 
population doesn’t grow so quickly that they strain their 
food supply, and they don’t interact with each other 
often enough to easily spread diseases that decimate 
other species.

As the wooded areas in northwestern and eastern 
Connecticut become more saturated with bears, young 
naïfs like Boo-Boo will more frequently find themselves 
in urban and suburban areas. While Boo-Boo certainly 
can’t make a den on Wallace Street, he was shrewd 
to wander there. People in cities outside of the state’s 
standard bear range don’t expect to see bears in their 
yards, so they leave their trash and bird feeders in tanta­
lizing rows that bears can raid like a lunch buffet. With 
circumstances so favorable, there’s no reason for ursine 
appearances in New Haven to wane any time soon.

For the most part, the state doesn’t interfere with the 
bears’ rugged individualism. “Our job is to manage the 
bear population in Connecticut,” Hawley says. “But 
we don’t like to meddle too much. We don’t transport 
bears far away from where we found them. We think 
sightings are a good thing—they mean the bear pop­
ulation is healthy. Just let bears be bears. Let ’em do 
their thing.” 

But Boo-Boo’s own resilience might become one of 
the greater threats to his survival: to keep the popu­
lation in check, Hawley says, Connecticut is consid­
ering allowing a bear-hunting season. And when he 
ventures into urban areas, Boo-Boo is most endangered 
by the kindly people who try to lend him a hand. It’s 
not uncommon for bears to break into people’s homes 
these days looking for food, or to return to the same 
bird feeder night after night, waiting for mealtime. 
“When you feed them, you habituate them to humans,” 
Hawley says. “And that makes them aggressive.” Haw­
ley laments that DEEP has already had to euthanize 
six bears this year that had become accustomed to 
approaching people. Closer interactions between our 
two species could give the phrase “human-bear con­
flict” a more sinister ring for both parties. If we’d like to 
keep both humans and bears alive, just about the worst 
thing we can do is try to make friends.
