with a proposal for a certain play, or 
funding, or anything." According to 
McAllister, HTE should take advantage 
of this opportunity. "HTE needs to 
propose a joint project with the Dramat 
so that we can have· another method of 
funding," he said. 

The Dramat's desi re to involve 
people of color is also apparent in a 
mainstage production policy to hire 
only directors who accept non-
traditional casting. Still, the Dramat 
does not supervise the actual process, 
and directors have the final say on who 
"Tell me not to waste my 
time because you're 
looking for a blond girl." 
gets cast. The Board plans to put a 
statement supporting non-traditional 
casting into the organization's by-laws 
this year. 

Some African-American actors are 
annoyed by what they believe to be the 
Dramat's liberal fac;ade. "This is a 
school. We're supposed to be learning 
and 
experimenting. 
If 
they're 
committed to doing good theater, then 
talent should be the number one factor," 
Smith said. '1f we're going to play real 
world, then let's be explicit. Tell me not 
to waste my time because you're 
looking for a blonde girl." 

Smith also criticizes the Theater 
Studies department for not going far 
enough in its policies toward people of 
color. "Recently people of color were 
d ropping out of the Theater Studies 
major like flies/' she said. "There's a lot 
of pressure on the dep artment, and so 
they issued that statement. But the 
department doesn't have any control 
over casting. lt doesn't change the 
situation." 

Theater Studies DUS DeRose has 
noticed that younger students still seem

· willing to try the major. "I see a far 
larger proportion of students of color in 
Theater Studies 110 than in the past," he 
said. 

The Theater Studies department 
hopes to elicit more input from people 
of color by expanding the role of the 
Student Advisory Committee. 
A 
departmental statement announced new 
initiatives from that committee: "Those 
who feel they represent a body of 
theatrical interest NOT covered by the 
Theater Studies curriculum are 
especially encouraged to apply." HTE's 
McAllister is pleased with the 
department's efforts. "I think the 
Theater Studies department does a 
pretty good job of non-traditional 
casting." 

Yale's theater community hopes 
that the appearance of students of color 
in this fall's musical will help send a 
positive message to the Class of 1994. 
"As a Puerto Rican, I'm really glad that 
Into the Woods got cast as it did," said 
Muniz. "If I were an actress in the 
audience I'd say 'wow, they really do 
cast whoever's good for the part.' 
Maybe that would make me audition." 

People of color see this kind of open 
casting as crucial. "It's a must in an 
integrated society," said Tara Murphy. 
"I want to be cast, not as a political 
statement, but because of my ability as 
an actress." 

After the Dramat began preparing 
for Into the Woods, 
Cassell-Scott 
reconsidered her views about Fiddler. 
"There is tension between blacks and 
Jews in this country and I realized that 
anything we can do to open a dialogue 
is u seful. I have to make sure I don't 
have a knee-jerk reaction like I did with 
Fiddler," she said. Cassell-Scott hopes 
the casting for Tnto the Woods is a step in 
the right direction. "We have to start 
making changes, because the more non-
traditional casting there is, the less 
noticeable and jarring it will be."
