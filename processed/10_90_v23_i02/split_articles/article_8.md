Who'll Take Out the Trash 
Kathy Reich 
A huge pile o£ trash sits on Middletown 
Avenue. Each year, city trucks take 
146,000 tons of garbage to the 
Middletown A venue landfill. Local 
corporations and nearby towns leave 
their trash there as well, paying New 
Haven $3 million annually .for the 
privilege. But in July the d"ump will 
shut down, and the city will lose both 
this revenue and a place to chuck its · 
trash. Getting rid of the garbage could 
cost $13 million a year. 

To cut that expense, Mayor John 
Daniels' administration has launched a 
war on waste, featuring a new 
processing plant able to recycle over 
half of New Haven's refuse. But the 
plan has run into fiscal woes and 
logistical snags. Few people outside 
City Hall seem to care. "I guess garbage 
goes to the curb and no one ever 
worries about it again," said Liz 
MacCormack, chairwoman of the Board 
of Aldermen Committee on Solid 
Waste. 

Six years ago, when then-mayor 
Biagio DiLieto learned the landfill 
would soon close, he suggested a 
simple solution: build an incinerator. 
New Haven could keep making profits 
off garbage, torching its own trash 
while charging outside customers to use 
the burn plant. But environmental 
groups, citing health risks from toxic 
ash, forced DiLieto to scrap the project. 
Ignoring warnings from the Connecticut 
Department 
of . Environmental 
Protection, New Haven continued to 
rely solely on the dump. "After DiLieto 
withdrew the proposal, his office just 
dropped the ball," said Frank Grasso, 
president of the Board of Aldermen. 
''We were content to keep dumping in 
the landfill, and no one sounded the 
alarm. No one said, 'It's one minute to 
midnight."' 

The city did try to buy itself some 
time. In 1989, the Board of Aldermen 
asked the DEP for permission to expand 
the landfill. This expansion would give 
the city at most three years of free 
garbage disposal. The DEP still has not 
responded. "There's a good chance that 
the state won't grant us an extension," 
Grasso admitted. "If New Haven loses its 
landfill, the city will have to pay a 
· private contractor "to haul the trash 
away for burning, most likely to 
Bridgeport. 

According to Sue 
Weisselberg, the city's Director of 
Intergovernmental Relations, the cost to 
ship garbage out of town and to pay 
Bridgeport to incinerate it comes to 
$10.4 million a year. 

Hoping to reduce this expense, 
the aldermen have launched a 
comprehensive attack on garbage. The 
goal: cut the city's waste by 60 percent 
over the next five years to reduce 
reliance on costly incineration. This 
strategy hinges on a processing plant 
that would separate New Haven's 
garbage into recyclables, compostables, 
and waste. 

Committee 
chairwoman 
MacCormack says the processing 
plant's future is virtually guaranteed. 
The aldermen will request bids from 
processors in November, and hope to 
find the right one by March. While 
processors charge huge fees to sort 
garbage, the aldermen believe they can 
recoup part of this expense by charging 
other towns that use the processor. The 
board also hopes to share what profits 
the processor earns from selling 
recyclables found in city trash. "In a 
best-case scenario we'd break even," 
Board President Grasso said. 

Weisselberg thinks Grasso is too 
optimistic. Although the aldermen 
expect the plant to charge a $70 
processing fee per ton to clients from 
outside New Haven, she fears operating 
costs may force fees above $100 a ton. 
Since incinerators charge slightly less, 
Weisselberg worries that the plant 
won't attract any outside customers. 
Furthermore, processing plants spew 
out lots of nonrecyclable waste that 
clients must then pay to incinerate 
elsewhere. "If it ends up at an extremely 
high cost," Weisselberg said, "and if a 
bum plant is a lot lower in cost, you'll 
have other towns putting all their 
garbage in .a truck and shipping it off 
somewhere to be burned." A processor 
cannot succeed if outside customers do 
not also use it, since even the city's 400 
daily tons of garbage is not enough to 
run a viable sorting business. 

Without a plant, New Haven has 
little chance of reaching its 60 percent
