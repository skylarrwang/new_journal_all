government will help pay for them. 

Still, he admits that most Connecticut 
residents do not want any prisons in 
their neighborhoods. "It's the not-in-
my-backyard syndrome," he said. He 
suggests sending state convicts to · 
prisons in less populous areas of the 
country. Voters in Texas and upstate 
New York have petitioned for new 
prisons in their districts, eager for the 
jobs that accompany these facilities. 


Defense attorney Rosenthal argues 
that prison expansion, whether in 
Trumbull or in Tuna, is more a political 
than a punitive tactic. "Voters want to 
lock convicts up and throw away the 
key," he said. Politicians seek to ease 
overcrowding 
through 
prison 
expansion rather than rehabilitation 
programs. But Rosenthal claims that 
prison expansion is destined to fail. 
"Building new 
prisons 
is 
the 
unthinking, popular thing to do," he 
said. "You can't build yourself out of 
the overcrowding problem." 


Lawlor wants Connecticut to jail 
only the most violent felons, keeping 
them in prison for their full sentences. 
For the rest, he hopes to replace 
incarceration with fines and terms at 
restitution centers. Inmates in such 
centers would be allowed to leave each 
day to work in local industries. The 
centers would use the inmates' earnings 
to compensate ·victims, cover room and 
board, and establish compulsory 
savings accounts. Lawlor believes these 
centers would have a positive impact on 
the prisoners. "They would have jobs 
and money when they got out," he said. 


Lawlor hopes that Connecticut's 
move to reinstate its parole board on 
October 1 will lead to a better 
correctional policy. Nine years ago, the 
state legislature, convinced that 
rehabilitation did not work, all but 
eliminated parole. Prisoners would 
serve their full sentences. Yet by 1982, 
administrators realized this policy could 
not work. "Jails were bursting at the 
seams," said Rosenthal. Once again, the 
state began releasing inmates-only this 
time without the help of parole boards. 
Small groups of prison officials 
around the state made release decisions 
at meetings closed to {he public and did 
not inform victims when they released 
inmates. The reinstated parole board 
replaces haphazard release practices 
with uniform standards for discharge. 
"Parole is a public, institutionalized 
procedure-not some 'behind closed 
doors' decision," said Rosenthal. "It 
puts rationality and credibility back into 
the. correctional system." Lawlor 
believes the new parole board will clear
