N on-Traditional Casting at the Dramat 
Into the Woods, opening November 2 at the University Theater, 
was not the Yale Dramat's first choice for the fall musical. 
When the Dramat board met last spring to pick this season's 
show , they wanted to stage Fiddler on the Roof. But Stephanie 
Cassell-Scott, the director hired for the production, felt uneasy 
about casting actors of color for a show about a Russian-
Jewish community. "At the time, it was hard for me to accept 
a black Tevya, because I feel that the oppressed people of the 
show should tell their own story," she said. 
Cassell-Scott's reservations caused the 
Dramat to drop Fiddler in favor of Into the Woods. "I wanted to do a show that the 
whole community would feel comfortable 
auditioning for, and Fiddler didn't seem 
ideal for that," said Cassell-Scott. " Because 
the story line of this show weaves three 
fairy tales together, it is much more open 
to non-traditional casting." Three of the 
show's major roles went to African-
American actors, including a woman 
playing the narrator, a role first played on 
Broadway by a white man. 
Still, non-traditional casting at the 
Dramat has been the exception and not the 
rule. From the fall of 1988 until last spring, 
only eight people of color performed in six 
mainstage shows. Non-white actors 
believe that casting should be more 
progressive. "Talent should transcend 
stereotypes," said Crystal Marie Smith 
(DC '93), a member of The Purple Crayon 
improvisational 
comedy 
group. 
"Appearance is important for the first two 
minutes that you're on stage, and for the 
rest it's the acting that matters." She 
points out that non-traditional casting 
usually is not considered, especially for 
plays about families and lovers. 
Hoping to attract more people of color 
to Yale auditions, David DeRose, the 
Director of the Undergraduate Theater Studies major, 
distributed a statement at the beginning of the term: 
Whenever possible, Theater Studies 
faculty and classroom productions 
will pursue opportunities for non-traditional 
casting (e.g.- the casting of people of color 
and/or women in roles written for or 
"traditionally" given to white males). 
DeRose issued this statement because no people of color 
auditioned for The Bourgeois Avant 
Garde, a show he directed for the 
Calhoun Dramat last spring. He 
recalls that several African-American 
actors said they assumed they would 
be cast in the role of the maid, a 
character traditionally played by an 
African-American actor. This type of 
concern among African-American 
actors is common at Yale. "The 
Dramat is white, and it's an 
intimidating atmosphere for people 
not used to that culture," said Tara 
Murphy (CC '91), who helped found 
Hekah, a theater group for women of 
color on campus. "I was marginalized 
in terms of the parts I was getting-
the weirdo, the witch, the slut." Other 
African-American actors also believe 
they are victims of stereotyped 
casting. "I can definitely feel a sense 
of frustration in the African-American 
community about people not getting 
parts, or only certain ones," said 
Nicole Duncan (TC '91), managing 
director of the Heritage Theater 
Ensemble, an African and African-
American theater company. "The term 
non-traditional casting itself suggests 
that we just arrived from another 
planet or we're a new kind of fruit or 
something." 

African-American students feel discouraged after 
numerous auditions and no call-backs. "If there are 20 people 
trying out, it's almost impossible to tell if you didn't get the 
part because you're black or because you're a bad actor," said 
Duncan. "You have to have an incredible love of theater to 
overcome that and keep auditioning." 
"I was marginalized in terms of the 
parts I was getting-the weirdo, the 
witch, the slut. " 
African-American actors believe that most student 
directors are reluctant to go out on a limb with non-
traditional casting. "It's tough when you're a black actor here 
and the director isn't exactly looking for you," said Marvin 
McAllister (OC '92), artistic director for HTE. "If they do cast 
you then they're taking a risk." McAllister cites the show 
Oedipus, the story of two brothers, as an example of this 
problem. "To do non-traditional casting you have to 
overcome the person's color and expect the audience to get 
past that," he said. Non-traditional casting becomes 
particularly tricky when directors consider its political 
implications. "No one can answer how to cast people of color 
in a play that is historically white," said Murphy. "Is it a 
political comment, or not? Audiences don't know." 
DeRose believes that Dramat directors do not generally 
cast on the basis of race. "Any intelligent director is going to 
look beyond the color of a person's skin," he said. Still, he 
admits race may sometimes influence a director's decision. 
"If an outstanding black actor auditions for a role written for a 
white person, he or she could get cast. But the middle-of-the-
road minority actor has very little chance." 
African-
American actors are frustrated by this inequality. "I have to be 
three times as good to get cast," said Purple Crayon's Smith. 
"You usually don't see average quality acting from people of 
color in a show here, and I have seen a lot of mediocre 
acting." 
To compensate, people of color have formed their own 
theater groups. Last year, women of color banded together 
during the production of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered 
Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf to create Hekah. The group 
chose the name from an ancient Egyptian feminine force. "We 
have this reputation that we're witches, and we are, in the 
sense that we are trying to reclaim women's power," said 
Murphy.
