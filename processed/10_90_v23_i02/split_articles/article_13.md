Balloons decorated the entrance to the Community 
Correctional Center on Whalley Avenue. Voices echoed off 
the bare cinderblock as guests nibbled doughnuts and sipped 
coffee. Prison officials led informal tours past bunk beds and 
new weight-lifting equipment. Deputy Warden Michael 
Pozzetta pointed out two steel shelves on the wall awaiting 
color television sets. "Just like the ones in motels, only 
tougher," he said . 


Last month, fifty neighbors, prison officials and 
government representatives gathered to inaugurate an 
addition to the Whalley complex. With no cells and no bars, 
the new minimum-security wing looks more like a camp 
cabin than a jail. 'They got their TV's, their telephones, their 
washer-dryers," said Mildred Darden, a community resident. 
"They got it better in here than I got it out there." 


The Connecticut Department of Correction sponsored the 
open house to present the completed prison to a community 
organization called Neighbors Opposing Prison Expansion! 
Two years ago, local citizens founded NOPE! in response to a 
state proposal to expand the Whalley facility. The DOC 
wanted to add 200 inmates to the existing prison population 
of 450. Fearing that the addition to the prison would ruin the 
neighborhood, NOPE! organized a grassroots campaign to 
stymie the project. 


NOPE! members worried that visitors to the expanded 
facility would clog the streets and disrupt the peace. For the 
past several years, Darden recalls, large groups gathered on 
the sidewalks around the jail, shouting to the prisoners inside. 
"They were whooping and hollering every night," she said. 
Neighborhood concerns intensified when the state decided to 
build the new wing on the prison parking lot. "Traffic was 
already a big problem," said community activist Laura 
Lockwood. 'The addition would only make things worse." 


Many community residents shared NOPE!'s complaints. 
The group attracted more than 100 people to its 
organizational meetings last year, held rallies outside the 
prison, and voiced objections to government officials. 'They 
succeeded in making it a city-wide issue," said Lockwood. 


Hoping to assuage NOPE!, the DOC covered existing 
windows with sheet metal and used frosted plexiglass on new 
windows so that light could come in, but no one could see in 
or out. This month, the department will also construct a 200-
car parking garage for visitors. Lockwood believes NOPE!'s 
complaints forced the state to modify its proposal. "Originally 
they had absolutely no plans for the garage," she said. 


The DOC gave in to NOPE!'s smaller demands but 
refused to kill the project. Faced with overcrowded prisons 
throughout the state, the DOC was determined to expand the 
Whalley facility. Today, inmates sleep on mattresses on the 
floors of many Connecticut jails, and officials release convicts 
early to clear space for new prisoners. Most convicted drug 
dealers serve only ten weeks of the standard two-year term. 
"The criminal justice system has become a farce-it cannot 
carry through on punishment," said Ken Rosenthal, a criminal 
defense lawyer for the New Haven Legal Assistance 
Association. "Drug dealers and buyers quickly learn that 
going to jail is an empty threat." 


In an effort to restore the justice system's bite, the DOC 
wants to raise Connecticut's inmate capacity from 10,000 to 
16,000 by 1993. This prison expansion program, begun in 
1986, could quadruple the state corrections budget to more 
than $1 billion a year. To save money, the DOC has built 
dormitory-style jails like the Whalley addition rather than 
more expensive cell-block prisons. NOPE! fears that these 
lower-security facilities are unsafe. Fights are difficult to 
control because dorm-style jails provide no way to separate 
inmates and employ fewer guards than traditional prisons do. 
"It is not the best way to run a jail," said State Assemblyman 
Michael Lawlor (D-East Haven), who co-chairs the State 
Subcommittee on Correction. "If a fight breaks out at the new 
Whalley prison, guards will run out and lock the doors 
behind them." 


Like Lawlor, State Assemblyman Robert Ward (R-
Branford) believes that Connecticut should not rely on dorm-
style jails. With maximum-security facilities overflowing, 
Ward fears the DOC will use the Whalley addition and others 
like it for criminals who belong in high-security jails. "All too 
often violent criminals are assigned to minimum-security 
prisons," he said. "The Whalley jail might hold anyone from 
drunk drivers to murderers," Lawlor added. 


To ensure public safety, Ward wants the state to build 
more maximum-security prisons. He hopes the federal
