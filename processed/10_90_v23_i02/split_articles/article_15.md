"The new jail might hold anyone from drunk 
drivers to murderers," said State 
Rep. 
Michael Lawlor(D-East Haven). 
Lawlor hopes the new Whalley Avenue jail will hold fewer prisoners, thus making it less th reatening prisoners and aid 
his plan to reserve traditional jails for 
the most dangerous criminals. 
But the parole board alone cannot 
solve overcrowding, nor can it deter 
crime. Lawlor warns that Connecticut 
must pursue alternative solutions now, 
before federal courts force the state to 
do so. In 1981, Texas inmates filed suit 
against that state, complaining about 
overcrowding and other safety hazards. 
Convinced that Texas would not clean 
up its act, a federal court took over the 
state correctional system and set 
population limits in all its facilities. In 
an effort to regain control of its prisons, 
the 
Texas legislature endorsed 
comprehensive criminal reform in 1989. 
Lawlor hopes Connecticut will learn 
from the Texas experience. "As with 
school desegregation, you can do it now 
or have the courts take over and do it 
their way," he said. 
Bu t NOPE! members are not 
heeding Lawlor's call to action. NOPE!'s 
October19, 1990 
formal 
involvement 
with 
Department of Correction will end with 
the completion of the Whalley center's 
garage. Though NOPE! organizers have 
pledged to support other Connecticut 
communities 
protesting 
prison 
expansion, most members are losing 
interest. While the parking garage and 
plexiglass 
windows 
are 
some 
consolation, the prisoners arriving at the 
Whalley facility on November 1 show 
that NOPE! has lost its main battle. "The 
government supposedly sympathized 
with us, blah, blah, blah," said 
Reverend Stanley Justice of the Bethel 
African Methodist Episcopal Church, 
where NOPE! held its meetings. "They 
went ahead and built it anyway." 


NOPE! members, Ward, Lawlor, and 
Rosenthal would have done otherwise. 
But for a state strapped for funds and 
facing a prison system about to burst, 
the Whalley addition is a quick fix. -
