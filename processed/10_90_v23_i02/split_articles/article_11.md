that Daniels's attitude toward the piece 
may reflect his general attitude toward 
arts in the city. "I'm not sure if the cuts 
in the Department of Cultural Affairs 
were due to the Mayor's inexperience 
with the arts or the city's financial 
crisis," she said. 
Administration cutbacks have 
slashed the arts across the board. The 
Comprehensive Arts Program, funded 
by the Department of Education, is 
struggling for survivfl). The p rogram, 
which places artists in the public 
schools to help teachers bring art into 
their curricula, is understaffed this year 
because the city dismissed four of the 
six artists who worked in the schools. 
Some arts adminstrators hope that 
the New Haven arts scene may yet see a 
revitalization. "There's a feeling that .if . 
the city can get back on its feet again 
financ;:llly, the size of the Department 
of Cultural Affairs will increase," said 
the Arts Council's Clarke. But Trachten 
has her doubts. "I don't think that the 
re-establishment of the department will 
happen during this term of Mayor 
administration," 
said 
Trachten. "If he is re-elected, I don't 
think it will be one of his priorities." 
Indeed, even before the budget cuts, 
Daniels moved to change the focus of 
the Department of Cultural Affairs. He 
wanted the depa rtment to provide 
services and plan events for visitors to 
the city, in the hope of increasing 
revenue for local businesses. 
Meanwhile, all the budget cutbacks 
have 
forced

organizations in the city to seek 
alternative sources of funding. Today's 
shaky economy leaves potential donors 
with little money to spare. ''We have to 
come up with new and creative ways to 
raise funds," said Bob Gregson, the 
current director and only remaining 
employee of the Department of Cultur~l 
Affairs. "But the dollars just aren't 
there this year." Local businesses that 
used to take up the slack left by the city 
must tum their backs on the arts. New
