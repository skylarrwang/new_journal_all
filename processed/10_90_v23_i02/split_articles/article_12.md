Former Dep't of Cult. Affairs employee Sara 
Trachten Is disappointed by recent cuts In 
New Haven's budget for the arts. 

Haven's First Night celebration, a New 
Year's Eve festival which debuted last 
year, will not happen this year because 
city merchants cannot put up the 
necessary capital to get the project off 
the ground. Gregson hopes to resurrect 
the event by charging admission at First 
Night 1992. 

High visibility arts programs do 
not yet feel the effects of budget cuts 
and a weakened economy. Large 
corporate donors such as Bank of 
Boston still support organizations like 
October 19, 1990 
the Shubert Theater. But experimental 
artists and arts organizations cannot 
depend 
on 
such 
commercial 
sponsorship. Most financial institutions 
are hesitant to attach their names to 
potentially controversial work. "The 
banking industry as a whole has been a 
cautious, conservative industry in terms 
of sponsorship," said Richard Beebe, 
spokesperson for Bank of Boston in 
Connecticut. "No corporation likes to 
engender controversy and attract 
critics." 

Gregson sympathizes with the 
experimental artist's problem. 
"I've 
run into viewpoints like the Bank of 
Boston's for fifteen years," he said. 
"That's why the NEA Locals Program 
was so terrific-because it funded a 
wide variety of things." The loss of this 
funding will hit city artists particularly 
hard, because the Locals Program 
mandated that the city earmark a 
portion of the money for individuals.
