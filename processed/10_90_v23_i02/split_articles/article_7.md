Sweet Solution 
Dr. Pietro DeCamilli, a researcher at 
Yale Medical School, thought his work 
on an obscure disease would affect only 
300 people worldwide. Instead, he may 
drastically improve the lives of over one 
million people in the United States 
Â· alone. Accidentally, DeCamilli and his 
team may have discovered a way to 
prevent and cure insulin-dependent 
diabetes. 

Until last August, doctors could 
do nothing to prevent or delay the 
progression of diabetes. The disease 
strikes its victims when cells in the 
pancreas stop producing insulin, which 
regulates the body's glucose levels. 
Insulin injections and a careful diet can 
control the disease's early symptoms, 
but diabetics eventually develop kidney 
damage, nerve impairment and vision 
loss. 

Scientists hypothesized that 
diabetes results from the destruction of 
a mysterious protein in insulin-secreting 
cells, called 64K. As many as seven 
years before the onset of the disease, a 
victim's immune system releases 
antibodies that destroy this protein. But 
because the pancreas produces the 
protein in such small quantities, 
scientists could not observe how losing 
64K would harm the body. 

DeCamilli stumbled upon 64K 
while 
researching 
a 
seemingly 
unrelated neurological disorder called 
Stiff-man's syndrome. 
Stiff-man 
patients show high concentrations of 
antibodies which destroy a protein in 
the brain known as glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GAD). 
DeCamilli 
noticed that an unusually high 
percentage of the stiff-man patients he 
studied suffered from diabetes. The 
ltatistic struck him as odd, until he 
realized that aside from the brain, GAD 
only exists in the insulin-secreting cells 
of the pancreas. Furthermore, h e 
observed that GAD weighs the same as 
protein 64K. 

Through a mixture of 
luck and intuition, DeCamilli realized 
that GAD and 64K were the same 
protein, solving a mystery which had 
befuddled diabetes researchers for ten 
years. 

DeCamilli contacted scientists at 
the University of California at San 
Francisco, and together they began to 
explore new possibilities for diabetes 
research. Laboratories can now harvest 
significant amounts of GAD from brain 
cells for their studies, instead of relying 
on meager supplies found in the 
attack on its own pancreas cells, doctors 
must currently suppress the entire 
immune system. The harmful side 
effects 
of 
immunosuppressants 
outweigh the benefits of delaying the 
disease. 

Although the identification of GAD 
heralds new treatment possibilities for 
diabetes, some scientists believe it may 
not lead to a cure. "It's a step in the 
right direction, but not the ultimate 
answer," said Dr. Robert Sherwin, Yale 
Professor of Medicine. He views GAD-
antibodies as a symptom of diabetes, 
not its cause. While this discovery will 
lead to earlier detection and delay the 
onset of the disease, he cautions that 
total prevention is still unattainable. 

But total prevention is DeCamilli's 
goal. He has abandoned his stiff-man 
research to work with UCSF on a GAD 
antibody screening test. "Tltis discovery 
of GAD is what all doctors dream of 
when they begin to do research," he 
said. "It's a big chance to make a 
significant difference."
