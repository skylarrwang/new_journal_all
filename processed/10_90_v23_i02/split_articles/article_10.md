Crossing theÂ· color Line 
I am at Speedline in Commons, looking 
for a place to sit. I scan the huge room, 
searching for familiar faces. I don't want 
to eat alone in public. Luckily I find a 
group of my Asian-American friends 
eating and chatting in a comer. As I sit 
down, I think how nice it is to have a 
group of friends to eat with and I 
remember how I met all these people in 
the first place. I recall my first day at 
Yale. 

Unlike most of my class, I did not 
arrive on Old Campus on August 31. I 
came to Yale nine days earlier to 
participate in the Pre-Registration 
Orientation Program. I did not meet a 
single European-American student for 
six days. The counselor who helped me 
overcome my first-day jitters was not a 
freshperson counselor, but an ethnic 
counselor-one of twenty assigned to 
the freshman class. My first friends at 
Yale were all students of color. Today, I 
look back on PROP with both 
appreciation and resentment. 

PROP was started twenty years ago 
to give incoming students of color extra 
time to adjust before the rest of the 
freshperson class arrived for the 
university orientation. PROP is a 
controversial program, attacked for 
encouraging ethnic segregation by only 
including students of color. PROP itself 
8 The New Journal 
has three goals for its participants: to 
familiarize new students with Yale, to 
establish relationships with ethnic 
counselors and other university 
personnel, and to foster friendships that 
create a social support network. 

PROP is most successful in creating 
friendships. On my first night at Yale, I 
spent the entire evening roaming Old 
Campus, meeting PROP people. I sat 
on the steps of Wright Hall talking un til 
three in the morning with people I had 
met only hours earlier. Later in th e 
week, I discovered the joy of diving 
through the Old Campus sprinklers at 4 
a.m., dragging unwilling friends 
through the watery experience. 
Every 
night there was a spontaneous party. 
What made the first night of PROP 
so different from orientation activities 
was its size. 
It was much less 
intimidating to socialize in a group of 
150 than in a group of 1,300. 

Unfortunately, the friendships PROP 
created tended to split along ethnic 
lines. 
During a visit to the African-
American Cultural Center, I felt 
awkward. I spent my time there talking 
to my Asian-American friends in one 
comer of the TV room while the African 
Americans gathered on the other side of 
the room. The two groups couldn't 
even agree on music. Many Asian 
Americans stayed off the dance floor 
because they disliked the rap m ix. 
When somebody cued up Erasure, the 
African Americans cleared the floor. 

Social networks cause many of 
PROP's problems. Many of my friends 
a re people whom I met at PROP or 
fr iends of PROP people. 
It's so 
tempting to stay inside these groups, 
never reaching out to meet new people. 
Many times in my first month at Yale, I 
have been with my roommates and then 
bumped into a friend from PROP. It is 
always somewhat difficult for me to 
integrate my friendships. But people 
make close friends at Freshman 
Outdoor Orientation Trips and

Freshperson Conference as well. What 
is the difference? 

Color. Color is the core of the 
PROP program. The ideal world would 
allow people to disregard skin color 
entirely. But this is certainly far from an 
ideal world. 
Color does make a 
difference. I am sitting with a group of 
my PROP friends at lunch. I spot my 
roommate eating alone on the other side 
of Commons. I go over to invite him to 
join us but he delicately refuses. He has 
a class to catch, he's in a hurry, he's 
perfectly fine where he is, he tells me. 
Eventually, another friend joins him. 
Our friends don't mix. And color is 
undeniably a part of the reason. 

PROP is the only pre--Yale program 
which restricts its invitations to certain 
groups of students. This practice makes 
PROP extremely controversial. The 
administration sends certain unspoken 
messages to the student body through 
its actions. When I first received my 
invitation to PROP, I reacted the same 
way I had to the invitation to Minority 
Weekend last spring and the calls from 
the Minority Recruitment workers. To 
me, Yale is saying that non-white 
students either deserve, or need, more 
orientation than other students. I am a 
specull case deserving special treatment. 
I need extra support, unlike normal 
white students who can do just fine on 
their own. The administration may not 
intend to send this message, but it is the 
one I hear. 

PROP is only one part of a broader 
network. The ethnic deans, ethnic 
counselors, and cultural houses add to 
the overall message-a message of 
white superiority. Some European-
American students use this message to 
claim that the widely-believed minority 
quota myth is enforced. They say that 
the university is dying to get minority 
students here and take care of them, 
and have made special allowances on 
their applications. 

Ethnic awareness and orientation to 
Yale should not be restricted to people 
of color. European Americans are an 
ethnic group as well. Why not open 
PROP up to all incoming students 
instead of just non-white students, 
while keeping it about the same size? 

Many white students resent the 
numerous support gyoups for every 
possible social group except European-
Americans. These students face racial 
issues as well. Perhaps European-

floor because they 
disliked the rap mix.

floor. " 
Americans would understand such 
racial issues much better after spending 
time at PROP. The inclusion of white 
students would not weaken the 
experience. I believe it would actually 
enrich PROP. 

The administration has made some 
changes in the program to avoid 
segregating PROP students from the 
rest of the student body. 
They 
shortened the program from almost two 
weeks to six days. This change allowed 
students to participate in FOOT or 
Conference as well as PROP. But other 
changes are also needed. PROP still 
causes racial uneasiness from the very 
beginning of the Yale experience. ln the 
future, perhaps, PROP could be 
transformed from part of the problem 
into part of the solution.
