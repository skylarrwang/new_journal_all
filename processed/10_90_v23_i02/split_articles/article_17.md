founded the Heritage Theater Ensemble 
to promote African-American actors 
and playwrights in the Yale-New 
Haven community. "HTE is necessary 
for having black theater at Yale," said 
Duncan, the group's managing director. 
HTE wanted to produce more shows 
emphasizing the African-American 
experience. 
"The 
mainstream 
productions here don't include black 
theater," said McAllister. "Much of the 
material is not about me." While 
African-Americans make up the 
majority of actors in Hekah and HTE, 
other ethnic and racial groups do not 
have their own options-perhaps 
because they simply do not have the 
same numbers. "Asian-American actors 
here are extremely rare, maybe because 
art is not the field that most Asian-
American communities and families 
support for their children," said Vivian 
Umino (SY '91 ), a Theater Studies. 
major. 

Dramat members acknowledg·e 
that Hekah and HTE provide outlets for 
people of color to express their talent. 
Yet some feel these groups segregate the 
theater community. "We don't have a 
lot of minority actors trying out for our 
plays," said Dramat board member 
Yanzel Muniz (TO '91). "When we have 
two black people audition for 
something, we're so happy." Muniz 
explained that Dramat members do not 
want to resort to affirmative action 
casting because they wish to avoid 
tokenism. "We want the best person to 
get cast," she said. 

The Dramat board is discouraged 
by the lukewarm reception that has met 
its attempts to open up its productions. 
Last spring, the Dramat tried to 
collaborate with playwright and 
professor Ngugi wa'Thiong'o 
to 
premiere his play Mama I Will Marry 
When 1 Want. Dramat board members 
were excited about the project. "We 
tried to get rid of the bad relationship in 
the theater community," said Dramat 
President Guy Myers (TO '91). Since 
wa' Thiong' o wanted an a ll African- 
American cast, Dramat staff members 
recruited heavily in that community. 
But not enough people showed up for 
the readings and the play was cancelled 
for lack of interest. 


African-American actors suggest 
that the failure of Mama I Will Marry 
When I Want may have been a matter of 
bad timing. Two other shows that 
involved many African-American actors 
conflicted with scheduled rehearsals for 
wa'Thiong'o's play. "People wanted to 
do it, but they were already 
committed," said Smith. '1t was too last 
minute to have a chance to work out." 
Muniz claims that the Dramat couldn't 
notify African-American actors sooner 
because wa' Thiong' o took so much 
time deciding which play to stage. "We 
really wanted to do the show, and a lot 
of things happened that weren't our 
fault," she said. 

The wa'Thiong' o project indicates 
the Dramat's willingness to sponsor 
productions about people of color. 
While 
African-American 
actors 
complain 
that 
their 
theater 
organizations can't match the resources 
available to the Dramat, Myers points 
out that these resources are up for 
grabs. "I want more people of color to 
come to the Dramat with proposals," 
Myers said. "HTE has never come to us
