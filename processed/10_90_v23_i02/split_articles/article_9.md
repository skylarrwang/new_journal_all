recycling target. "Maybe with a 
processing plant and voluntary 
recycling, we could do 60 percent," 
Grasso said. "But we could never do it 
just voluntarily." Even if the city does 
Â·find a bidder who can keep costs down, 
the plant will not open before 1993. In 
the meantime, the city must rely solely 
on voluntary recycling to ease its 
dependency on the Bridgeport 
incinerator. New Haven residents now 
recycle at most five percent of their 
trash. 

The Daniels administration has 
invested $200,000 in recycling, and 
another $175,000 in personnel, but the 
city employs only one person in its 
recycling office, Kate Miller. "Everyone 
would like to see Miller have some help, 
but the money just isn't there," said 
MacCorm ack. "We've tossed around 
some ideas like making recycling 
mandatory and fining those who don't 
comply, but those schemes really don't 
raise much money. Recycling is 
expensive." 

In the long run, though, it pays. 
If the processing plant never gets built, 
voluntary recycling will be New 
Haven's only way to stem the expensive 
flow of refuse going to the Bridgeport 
incinerator. If the city finds a contractor 
to build the plant, New Haven could 
still use curbside recycling to turn a 
profit from the sale of what it recovers 
from recycled waste. Last January 
Miller gave bins to 6,500 households to 
encourage home trash separation so city 
trucks could pick u p glass, paper, 
plastic and aluminum at the curb. By 
11eXt May, all 20,000 households on city 
Slrbage routes will be able to recycle as 
easily as the pilot group, although any 
CUrbside recycling program depends on 
residents' cooperation. "There's still a 
lot of stuff that we're missing, but we're

New Haven will have to find a new roost for its dally 400 tons of trash. 
trying to plug up the holes," Miller said. 

The biggest hole gapes where 
city dump trucks don't go-businesses 
and apartment buildings with more 
than six units, which must contract with 
private haulers. New Haven is losing 
valuable revenue by letting this garbage 
go to the landfill without recycling any 
of it. Though Miller has received an 
$80,000 state grant to start recycling 
programs in two public housing 
projects, other apartment dwellers and 
businesses that recycle must cart their 
"We were content to 
keep dumping in the 
landfill, and no one 
sounded the alarm. No 
one said, 'It's one 
minute to midnight. "' 
separated materials to one of only five 
drop-off sites. 

The administration has no 
additional plans for recycling. Cities 
like New York and Seattle have 
implemented mandatory programs, but 
New Haven can't even enforce the anti-
garbage ordinances already on the 
books. Recently the city outlawed 
styrofoam and plastic bags, but local 
merchants have not complied with the 
ban. 

For now, voluntary recycling 
must succeed beyond all expectations in 
order to clean up the city's budget. If 
New Haven doesn't find a processing 
plant operator, the city will soon pay 
$13.4 million a year to bum its waste in 
Bridgeport. Even if a plant is built, it 
would not start working before 1993, 
saddling New Haven with a $30 million 
garbage debt until then. Mayor Daniels 
already faces a $10 million budget gap, 
with schools, homeless shelters and the 
police all desperate for more money. 

Tax hikes and slashed city 
programs look more and more 
likely. New Haven has no real choice: it 
must shell out the dollars to get rid of a 
garbage heap that grows 400 tons each 
day.
