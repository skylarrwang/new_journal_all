Last December, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney dropped 
a bomb on Textron-Lycoming, a small company in Stratford, 
Connecticut. He announced that Congress had cut funds for 
the M1 tank project. By 1992, all production of M1s-the 
main battle tank of the United States army-would cease. The 
Congressional decision deprived Textron-LycominSt the sole 
manufactuer of M1 engines, of nearly half of its business. 

Then Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. 

The war looming in the Middle East has given Textron-

After feasting for years on generous military spending by 
the federal government, Connecticut defense companies like 
Textron-Lyc"oming and UNC now face tougher economic 
times. Connecticut, the nation's most defense-dependent 
state, has been hit hard by military cuts. Of the 13,000 
American workers who lost their defense-industry jobs last 
year, 1,500 lived and worked in Connecticut. Defense-related 
business makes up over seven percent of Connecticut's gross 
state product, and 70 percent of all manufacturing jobs in the

But 
~~connecticut is facing a severe 
problem. The defense cuts could 
devastate our economy. "" 
During the arms build-up 
of the 1980's, Connecticut's 
defense business boomed while 
other industries floundered. 
While manufacturers like 
General Electric and Carpenter 
Steel were shutting down 
plants, military contracts 
company's problems are far 
from solved. Once the last ========================== brought billions of dollars of 
revenue into the state. But now 
engine rolls off the assembly line, 1 ,300 employees may lose 
their jobs. 

Textron is not alone in its predicament. The United 
Nuclear Corporation in Montville, Connecticut also feels the 
crunch from recent defense cuts. UNC produces one thing-
propulsion units for nuclear submarines. The company has 
supplied these units to the Navy for the last 34 years, But last 
March, in an effort to trim its expenses, the Pentagon granted 
an exclusive contract for these units to Babcock and Wilcox, a 
Virginia technologies company. The Defense Department 
plans to phase out UNC over the next two years. By 1993 the 
company will have finished and shipped out its last 
propulsion unit. In the meantime, UNC is laying off workers 
every week. Since January, 352 employees have lost their jobs. 

that defense contractors are firing workers and threatening to 
dose plants, state residents fear the worst. "Connecticut is 
facing a severe problem," said State Senator Thomas Sullivan 
(D-Guilford). "The defense cuts could devastate our 
economy." 

In a state which lost 65,000 manufacturing jobs during the 
1980s, displaced defense workers struggle to find 
employment. "We're seriously concerned about the lay-offs," 
Ciuci said. "It's virtually impossible to find manufacturing 
jobs in this area." Though the state has spent some money to 
retrain workers, most agree that these programs are notÂ·the 
answer. "It doesn't make sense to train people for jobs that 
don't exist," said UNC Vice President Harold Burton. "Unless 
you help create new jobs, you're not doing anyone a favor." 

Many business leaders, Burton included, believe that the 
state must help defense companies develop new products. 
The Connecticut legislature agrees that product diversification 
could cure the industry's ills. Last October it formed 
Connecticut Innovations Incorporated, an organization that 
gives money to companies for product research. "The money 
we provide is an investment, not a grant or a loan," said Burt 
Jonap, CII project director. "In return, we collect royalties 
from the sales of the newly-developed product." Created to 
bolster all of Connecticut's industries, CII devotes much of its 
energy to military contractors. Within a year, Jonap said, CII 
expects to see the first returns on its investments. 

A number of private groups share CJI's concern for 
regional industry. The Naugatuck Valley Project, a coalition 
of sixty-six community groups, was formed in 1983 to rescue 
Connecticut manufacturers from financial trouble. "We've 
saved over 2,700 jobs statewide," said Kevin Bean, NVP's staff
