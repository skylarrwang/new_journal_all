After Navalny
Belanger, the former admissions 
officer, remembers Navalny confiding in 
her that he was inspired by how many 
Yale students believed they would be 
world leaders. Some were convinced 
they would be president of the United 
States. “Just to be around that level of 
confidence and belief in that kind of 
power of an individual to affect change…
It’s really influencing me,” Belanger 
recounts Navalany saying. 

At Yale, Navalny kept his anti-cor­
ruption blog—Navalny.ru—alive while 
also expanding his efforts through 
RosPil, a crowdsourced project aimed at 
exposing fraudulent state contracts. In 
November 2010, he released a 300-page 
dossier exposing alleged massive corrup­
tion in the construction of Transneft’s 
East Siberia–Pacific Ocean pipeline. “But 
before you start reading, look in your 
wallet,” he wrote in one post. “You may 
not have noticed, but about 1,100 rubles 
[approximately 37 dollars] have disap­
peared from it. Not much for each of us, 
but this amount was stolen from every 
adult resident of Russia. In total, at least 
$4 billion were stolen in the course of this 
story.”  

Within six months, the site received 
one million visits monthly. Navalny 
encouraged visitors to anonymously 
share information about dubious gov­
ernment agreements and discuss the 
allegations online. Meanwhile, the 
Kremlin sought to discredit him, plac­
ing Navalny under investigation by the 
Russian Minister of the Interior. 

Near the end of the program, the fif­
teen fellows of the Class of 2010traveled 
to Washington, D.C., for the program’s 
annual visit to the State Department. 
There, Harold Koh, a Sterling Professor 
of International Law at Yale Law School, 
who was serving as Legal Adviser to 
the State Department, made a point of 
pulling aside former program director 
Michael Cappello and Navalny. Cappello 
remembers 
Koh 
saying, 
“Secretary 
Clinton knows Alexei’s name.” People 
at the highest levels of U.S. foreign pol­
icy were aware of Navalny’s work and his 
ties to the University. Cappello pointed 
out that Secretary Clinton is a graduate 
of Yale Law herself, and “that that con­
nection with this Russian dissident mat­
tered.” It was clear that some of Yale’s 
most powerful levers were being engaged 
on his behalf.

L
ess than a year after the pro­
gram ended, Navalny seized interna­
tional attention by leading mass protests 
against suspected fraud in the December 
2011 parliamentary elections. Expanding 
his investigations, he branded the rul­
ing United Russia party as the “Party of 
Crooks and Thieves,” a label that stuck 
and contributed to its declining vote 
share. The fallout sparked Russia’s larg­
est anti-Kremlin protests since Putin 
took power, with nearly sixty thousand 
demonstrators nationwide.

His online campaign urging Russians 
to vote against United Russia had helped 
push the party’s official support below 
50 percent, but Putin’s party still claimed 
victory. Opposition figures and outside 
observers, including the Organisation 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, 
called the results a sham, citing wide­
spread fraud and “serious indications of 
ballot box stuffing.” 

Navalny was arrested the night of 
the protest and sentenced to fifteen days 
in jail for defying a government offi­
cial—the first of more than ten arrests 
over the next decade during which he 
spent hundreds of days in custody.

Upon word of Navalny’s arrest, the 
Class of 2010 World Fellows’ Whatsapp 
group quickly mobilized, as fellows 
coordinated efforts to support his 
release. Filipino World Fellow of the 
Class of 2005, Vicente Santiago Pérez, 
suggested each fellow hand-deliver a 
letter to the Russian embassy in their 
country demanding Navalny’s release. 
Nearly 150 fellows followed suit. To 
avoid fueling accusations of Western 
imperialist interference, they appealed 
directly to their own governments, 
leveraging the World Fellows’ global 
network rather than invoking the Yale 
University name. Three weeks later, 
Navalny was released, further solidify­
ing his status as the face of the oppo­
sition.rather than invoking the Yale 
University name.

named as the most criminal Yale World 
Fellow ever. I’ll be extremely grateful if 
you can help me,” he wrote in 2013.

He’d lose his mayoral election, but 
go on to draw up support for a Yalie 
on another ballot three years later. Rees, 
now-Mayor of Bristol, England, com­
mented on Navalny’s support during his 
2016 mayoral election as another gesture 
of his former neighbor’s generosity.

“I’m still not allowed to leave Russia, 
but when I can, I’m gonna visit Bristol 
like a boss with a mayor friend of mine,” 
he emailed Rees.

U
pon his return to Russia, Navalny 
established the FBK.  Relying on small 
donations from thousands of ordinary 
citizens rather than a few large donors, 
Navalny built a movement resilient to 
state interference. 

“The most important thing we do 
is, then, to spread the story so mil­
lions hear about it,” he wrote in Patriot, 
about the strategy behind FBK’s early 
media campaign. Investigative doc­
umentaries turned opaque graft into 
compelling narratives that resonated 
with 
ordinary 
Russians. 
Notable 
examples 
include 
Putin’s 
Palace: 
History of the World’s Largest Bribe 
(2021), which exposed a $1.4 billion 
palace allegedly built for Putin and 
amassed over one hundred million 
views. Another FBK documentary 
detailed then-Prime Minister Dmitry 
Medvedev’s network of bribes, spark­
ing nationwide protests. 

From prison, Navalny reflected, 
“The year 2012 set a pattern in my life, an 
endless vicious circle for many years to 
come: protest rally, arrest, protest rally, 
arrest. It was unpleasant, of course, but 
that was not going to stop me.” Even 
with his candidacy banned, Navalny 
ran again for mayor of Moscow in 2016 
and for president under Russia of the 
Future Party in 2018. He established 
FBK offices in over eighty cities across 
Russia. His ambition was clear: to cre­
ate a “permanent working structure” for 
the opposition that could bring people 
to the streets, participate in elections, 
and—eventually—win them.

In August 2020, Russian operatives 
poisoned Navalny with the nerve agent 
Novichok. The assassination attempt, 
which is widely believed to be ordered 
by Putin, left the then 44-year-old 
hospitalized in Germany for over two 
weeks while he remained in a coma. Just 
five months later, he decided to return to 
Russia. He refused to ask his country­
men to risk their lives to take down the 
Putin regime while he mused on politi­
cal theory from abroad.

Upon his return, he was imme­
diately arrested on faulty extremism 
charges upon landing, sparking nation­
wide protests in his support. 

Cappello reflected that those close 
to the leader saw that, “the fundamen­
tal problem in protecting Alexei, was 
Alexei.” They could not imagine a sce­
nario in which he would have been com­
fortable not returning to Russia.

“I remember thinking, would I be 
more likely to attend his inauguration, 
or his funeral?” Capello said. “Turns out, 
I’d go to neither.”

With Navalny’ death came the col­
lapse of a fragile hope. An alternative
Navalny’s political influence grew 
when he campaigned for the position of 
Moscow mayor in 2013. His grassroots 
approach garnered 27 percent of the vote, 
an unprecedented feat for an opposition 
candidate during Putin’s tenure.

Russian state media frequently 
highlighted his Yale education, label­
ing him “the Yale World Fellow” and 
“Yale Mayor” during his mayoral cam­
paign. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the 
Russian Communist Party, demanded 
Navalny’s imprisonment due to his 
ties to the “Imperial West” and labeled 
him as a “direct offspring of their 
union.” Kremlin-aligned critics went as 
far as accusing him of being a Central 
Intelligence Agency operative, reflecting 
the broader distrust towards intellectu­
als who engage with global networks.

During Navalny’s mayoral cam­
paign, Cappello, despite helping advo­
cate for Navalny’s release within the 
World Fellows network after his 2011 
arrests, refuted claims that Yale had 
bolstered Navalny’s political ambitions. 
Cappello told the German newspaper 
Deutsche Welle, “Our intention is not to 
support transitions of government.” 

Navalny was eager to dispel accu­
sations that he was a tool of foreign 
interests, whether that of Yale or the 
United States government. Belanger 
remembers him pleading she close his 
and his wife’s Bank of America accounts 
during his run for Moscow mayor in 
2013. A foreign bank account would do 
him no good in securing national trust 
in Russian elections, he realized.

In his email to Belanger, he went on 
to cite his growing criminal accolades, 
courtesy of the Kremlin. “I guess I can be

Russian history of liberatory democ­
racy, a near end to the Putin years that 
seemed far-fetched but not impossible, 
for the moment, was gone.

Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya 
says, when the Putin era ends, which 
she sees as inevitable, she will run as an 
opposition candidate. She intends to 
participate in free and fair elections and 
become President of Russia, Navalnaya 
told the BBC. Until Putin leaves power, 
she cannot return to Russia, as she was 
charged in absentia to two months in 
prison for participation in an extremist 
organization: the FBK.

N
avalny’s Passing hasn’t stopped 
the FBK. Biryokova likened their 
work in exile to running with weights 
tied to your legs, growing heavier with 
every step. “Right now, in Russia, you 
have to run and run. And it gets worse, 
and worse. You can’t just go to the streets. 
You can’t just protest Putin.” 

She recalled how Navalny’s unflinch­
ing belief in the promise of a democratic 
future for Russia kept the team going, 
even under immense pressure. “After 
speaking with him in his office, you’d 
walk away with three new projects to take 
on,” Biryokova said. “He’d convince you to 
keep pushing, that the movement needed 
you, that you must serve like he was.”

Now, in the absence of that guiding 
force, the task ahead feels even more 
pressing. “We don’t have a silver bullet 
that will end it tomorrow,” Volkov, for­
mer Chairman of the FBk and director 
of political operations for the Future 
Party, said. The opposition’s focus, he 
explained, is to force Putin to expose the 
contradictions and inefficiencies of the 
political system. “We don’t know when 
it will collapse, how it will collapse, or 
how much time it will take, but shed­
ding light on its flaws makes it more 
likely to collapse sooner.” 

Since Navalny’s death, the dan­
ger has only escalated. As of Feb. 2025, 
Volkov faces eleven politically moti­
vated criminal cases initiated by Putin’s 
regime. Biryukova herself was forced 
to flee Russia in 2019 due to mounting 
threats from the government.

“What bothers me deeply is that 
Alexei always talked about the beautiful 
future he envisioned, but he never got to 
see it,” Biryukova said. But, as Birykova 
reflected, they could only expose the 
Kremlin’s lies if they kept telling the truth.  
“Give me a little time. And then I go to 
work,” Biryukova posted in her tribute to 
her boss and friend, on February 17, 2024, 
the day after his passing. 

For the FBK—and the future of the 
Russian opposition—there is no alternative.

Volkov says the opposition is pre­
pared to run campaigns and win elections. 
They’ve done it before—cutting United 
Russia’s hold on the Moscow city parlia­
ment in 2019—and they’ll do it again.  
“The only predictable thing about how 
change happens in Russia,” Volkov reflected 
during a panel at a screening of Navalny 
(2022) last November in Yale’s Luce Hall, 
“is that it always happens unpredictably.”

This unpredictability shaped Navalny’s 
approach to leadership, including his prepa­
rations for the possibility of his own death.

“After his poisoning attempt, journalists 
kept asking, ‘What would your team do if 
you were killed?’” Biryukova recounted.

Navalny’s answer — steady, pragmatic: 
“They would just work. They know how.”

Exiled but unyielding, the FBK con­
tinues its fight online. As of February 
2025, the homepage of its website, stark 
in white and Russian-red, greets visitors 
with a roster of “bribetakers and war­
mongers”—a biting yet cheeky rebuke of 
the Kremlin’s corruption. It’s right out of 
Navalny’s playbook.

Anna Biryukova remembered the 
day she gave birth to her second child 
while Alexei Navalny was in prison, 
just one month after the full-scale 
invasion of Ukraine. “It was an over­
whelming day, as I was dealing with 
the birth of our child while Alexei’s 
future remained uncertain,” she recalls. 
Despite the chaos, Navalny sent a 
note through his lawyer and addressed 
Biryukova by one of many endear­
ing nicknames he was known to coin 
for his team (Biryukova, for her part, 
always called him Alexei). “Annette, I 
congratulate you,” he wrote. “You can 
have many days like those in court, 
waiting for another sentence, but giv­
ing birth is something unique, and this 
is what makes today important.” Even 
from behind bars, Navalny’s message 
was clear—life, new life, and specifi­
cally the new Russian generation, was 
something worth celebrating. ∎
