n the nigHT of the 2024 pres­
idential election,  Ruoyu Zhou 
’27 sat at a watch party in her 
friend’s suite as the United States map 
reddened. 
“It felt kind of like a joke at first, and 
I remember people were treating it as if 
it were some sort of TV show. The line 
between politics and entertainment felt 
blurry,” Zhou said. “As the night went 
on, it just began to feel more real, both 
in terms of what it meant for me, and 
what it meant for my American friends.” 
Zhou, an international student 
who grew up in Guizhou, China, who 
attended high school in Singapore, 
wasn’t sure how the election results 
would affect her directly as an inter­
national student. “I knew that the 
election was definitely related to 
our lives, especially for me given the 
worsening of U.S.–China relations, but 
we aren’t involved in the voting or how 
the election turns out. Ultimately it’s 
not our country.”
Zhou echoes a sense of emotional 
distance shared across the ten inter­
national students I spoke to about the 
2024 U.S. presidential election. While 
Donald 
Trump’s 
reelection 
signi­
fies global changes, many students 
expressed mixed feelings about their 
investment in the results. 
Like many international students, 
I applied to Yale from Japan hoping to 
pursue educational and financial oppor­
tunities unavailable in my home country. 

Most of the students I spoke to felt sim­
ilarly, and seven shared that they hope 
to secure employment in the U.S. for at 
least a few years after graduation. And 
yet many students, myself included, 
don’t wish to stay in the U.S. long-term 
for cultural and political reasons. 

The election of Donald Trump has 
called the stability of international stu­
dents—and their futures in the U.S.—
into question. In the wake of the results, 
many international students are ques­
tioning their relationships to the U.S. as 
a whole. Their reactions manifest in an 
emotional distancing from the U.S. and 
disillusionment with its image as a land 
of endless opportunity and democratic 
freedom.

OR MANY INTERNATIONAL students, 
the election feels personal in its threat 
to their places in America and to their 
prospects of staying post-graduation. 
International students pursuing a 
full-time degree arrive in the country on 
an F-1 visa, or a “nonimmigrant visa for a 
temporary stay” specifically for students 
pursuing full-time academic studies at 
a U.S. institution. They are temporary 
guests—when their visas are at risk, so 
are their legal grounds for remaining in 
the country.
Since his inauguration, Trump has 
already made moves to threaten their 
security. 

On January 26, Donald Trump 
threatened a 25 percent tariff on Colombia 
alongside visa sanctions which would 
deem Luis Tomás Orozco Vaca ’26 from 
Colombia’s visa nonrenewable. 
While a deal was reached hours later, 
the move showed the unpredictability of 
Trump’s actions on immigration. “I think 
Trump has shifted U.S. foreign policy in 
a way where he is willing to strike down 
any deviance and target countries with 
insane responses,” Orozco said.“That’s 
definitely a new dimension of insecurity.”
Critical
But then you see that 
America is becoming 
more and more 
unstable, and Trump 
inarguably being 
a big aggregator 
of many problems, 
which makes me 
concerned for the 
future.
