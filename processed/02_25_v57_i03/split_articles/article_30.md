Elm City Cycling, one of the advocacy groups out 
of which Safe Streets grew, Hausladen became a key 
member of the nascent Safe Streets Coalition. The 
coalition’s first project was momentous. In the spring 
and summer of 2008, citizens and experts worked 
together to pass the Complete Streets Manual, a 
sweeping mandate to prioritize active transporta­
tion across city streets. After the Coalition delivered 
a three thousand-person petition to the Board of 
Alders, the legislation was passed in 2008.


Cycling in New Haven requires you to keep 
your “head on a swivel,” Kyle Anthony, general man­
ager of the Bradley Street Bike Co-Op, told me. A 
lapse in vigilance could make you eat concrete or 
metal. Bike lanes end abruptly, forcing cyclists to 
veer into the car lane. Many beginner cyclists end up 
taking the sidewalk—illegally. Even the experienced 
likened their commutes to constantly merging on 
and off an interstate. Kai Addae, a Safe Streets orga­
nizer and adventurous cycling enthusiast, described 
how she used to have to cross four lanes of traffic to 
reach a bike lane on the other side: “There’s no pre­
dictability for me there, there’s not even an expecta­
tion that bikes would be there.” 


In the face of sluggish progress and near-
monthly fatalities, a sense of community is indis­
pensable for activists. There are three types of 
cyclists, Anthony tells me: commuters, athletes, and 
those who want to heal their inner child. “I’m in the 
camp of never wanting to grow up,” Anthony said. 
The coalition brings together all three. After all, as 
Hausladen told me, “everyone owns the streets.”


III. Roadblocks
Since Rainof’s death, there have been several 
lectures in her honor by the Yale School of Medicine, 
hundreds of Facebook posts dedicated to her mem­
ory, and innumerable pink and white carnations 
laid down gently where she died. But, seventeen 
years later, the intersection of South Frontage and 
York has seen two more fatalities and few changes. 


Ownership of South Frontage Road was passed 
from the state to the city in 2020, yet promised safety 
improvements—1.5 million dollars in raised cross­
walks and bike lanes—have yet to begin. 


Comprehensive traffic safety improvements 
are, unsurprisingly, expensive. A block of sidewalk 
demands a couple thousand dollars, and a single 
intersection project depletes the city’s funds by at 
least a million dollars. Ambitious projects looking at 
an entire stretch of road require consultants to hold 
design meetings and draft and redraft plans—the 
upcoming Chapel Street two-way conversion was 
only made possible with an eleven million dollar 
state grant. The transportation department cinches 
most funding for large projects from competitive 
state grant processes. The rest is then scraped up 
from what’s leftover of property taxes. 


“What ends up happening in Connecticut is 
everybody gets a little bit. Nobody gets enough,” 
Hausladen said. “So everyone just sort of pisses and 
moans and complains.”


The city is also still healing from history. In 
1957, Mayor Richard Lee ordered the Oak Street 
Connector project, displacing communities he 
deemed “slums” to make way for a highway that con­
nected the suburbs and tore through the city. New 
Haven was the nation’s urban renewal testing ground, 
having received more money per capita than any 
other city. Not only was the connector never fully 
realized and ultimately an economic embarrassment, 
but it also left behind a web of one-way streets—a 
fatal precedent for a car-centric city. Today, New 
Haven’s gridded streets shuttle cars through down­
town as if they were on race tracks. 


South Frontage Road, half of the Oak Street 
Connector, after it was demolished and rerouted by 
the Downtown Crossing Project, still bears the scars 
of a hasty and rude birth. In 2020, Yale Law student 
Keon Ho Lim was killed in a “right-hook accident” 
while cycling through South Frontage and York. In 
a right-turn-only lane, he attempted to continue 
straight, only to collide with a truck turning right 
from the lane to his left. Neither was at fault; bikers 
are taught to stay right in the absence of a dedicated 
bike lane, and the driver could not have seen him. A 
commenter under an article about Lim’s death called 
the street design “criminal.”


From I-95, North and South Frontage run anti­
parallel to each other, one starting and one ending at 
Ella T Grasso Boulevard. The road has been dubbed 
“Death Boulevard” by the New Haven Independent, 
as nine people have been killed there alone since 2019. 
Ella T Grasso is a behemoth to cross as a pedes­
trian. A four, at times five, lane “stroad”—combin­
ing the deadly speeds of an arterial road with the 
multi-purpose usage of a street—the boulevard is an 
example of how state ownership of a street can hin­
der its progress. Hausladen worked for years to add 
nearly a mile of sidewalk, and even then, one side 
still lacks a sidewalk. 


Aaron Goode, longtime traffic safety and envi­
ronmental activist, invited me to the West River 
Peace Garden, which lies right by the boulevard. 
Carrying a plastic bag to collect trash, Goode wore a 
bright orange Connecticut Trails Census vest over a 
windbreaker and argyle sweater. He works at the gar­
den often, and today he brought a friend. They both 
wear newsboy caps and slip into Yiddish as we chat. 
Six years ago, Goode was cycling along the 
Ella T Grasso is a behemoth to cross as a 
pedestrian. A four, at times five, lane “stroad”—
combining the deadly speeds of an arterial road 
with the multi-purpose usage of a street—the 
boulevard is an example of how state ownership 
of a street can hinder its progress.

Farmington Canal when he was hit by a truck. The 
road was double-laned, and while the nearest car 
had yielded, the car in the other lane, obstructed by 
the first, could not brake in time. “I was completely 
immobilized for weeks, months. But after that, you 
have to get up and get back to work.”


Back at Ella T Grasso, the city has made the 
boulevard safer after hard-fought negotiations with 
the state with a new crosswalk where four pedestri­
ans died in a single year and a lane removal to reduce 
the possibility of a crash like Goode’s. Behind the 
garden, construction crews are building a new suite 
of townhouses, championed by the city to stitch the 
neighborhoods together again. 


Goode and other activists don’t blame any 
individual in the city government. The slow prog­
ress, rooted in a risk-averse and incremental cul­
ture, surpasses a single person; after all, as Goode 
said, Connecticut is the “land of steady habits.” In 
the meantime, though, pedestrians and cyclists must 
navigate the deadly streets left in place by the city’s 
historically car-centric mindset. Last April, Goode’s 
friend and peace activist Yusef Gürsey was walking 
home from a protest when he was struck by a car 
on Whalley Avenue in a hit and run—on the same 
street where Gabrielle Lee died in 2008. 


IV. Black Box
Somewhere in the depths of City Hall, per­
haps in the aldermanic chamber or perhaps in a 
smaller, shadowy meeting room, five people over­
see the annual milling and paving list. Traffic safety 
improvements are contingent on this list, as the 
transportation department must wait for a road to be 
repaved by the Department of Public Works before 
restriping to narrow lanes or adding bike paths.  


The Resource Allocation Committee was 
formed in 2012 and consists of two city officials, two 
alders, and a civilian chosen by the board of alders. It 
was created out of alders’ concerns that Mayor John 
DeStefano held a dictatorial grip on the transpor­
tation infrastructure budget. Hausladen and Mayor 
Justin Elicker, then alders themselves, were the sole 
two nay votes among the thirty-member board. They 
were concerned the change would merely shift power 
to another political body, failing to “depoliticize” the 
oversight of transportation infrastructure. 


Over a decade later, the committee’s stand­
ing members are not listed on the city’s website. 
Residents have no way of attending its meetings, and 
many likely do not even know it exists. What could 
have been a committee that liaised with activists and 
civilians, that allowed fervent discourse in public 
meetings, that fielded concerns about project statuses, 
ended up being yet another cryptic committee in 
City Hall. My attempts to contact its members were 
unsuccessful. 


The Resource Allocation Committee’s deci­
sion-making process is not made public. While 
Mayor Elicker emphasized to me the committee’s 
role in ensuring internal collaboration and fairness 
in project distribution, activists questioned the com­
mittee’s fundamental role. If the milling and paving 
list is to be one of the city’s methods of traffic infra­
structure improvement, spreading it across neighbor­
hoods without a long-term plan leads to piecemeal 
development. The streets they focus on also don’t 
all correspond with high crash zones, Safe Streets 
activist Maximilian Chaoulideer pointed out. As 
their concerns continue to grow—SeeClickFix, the 
city’s online forum for noting necessary repairs, has 
over five thousand unresolved requests—activists 
and residents feel unable to see past the city’s opaque 
processes. 


“The bureaucrats at City Hall are playing God,” 
Hausladen said, “By having projects in a black box, 
they can switch stuff around from one season to the 
next. Nobody’s the wiser.” 


V. Jaded
Every weekday, safe streets activist Rob 
Rocke bikes from East Rock to his job as an IT sup­
port technician for Yale. He takes the Grove Street 
bike lane all the way down to the heart of campus, 
before the path ends in front of the Schwarzman 
Center. His work might call him to Chapel Street, 
where he must still weave through speeding cars. Or 
to Whitney Avenue, where traffic calming measures 
were slated to begin in 2022 but have been delayed to 
this year.


During his decades as an activist, Rocke has seen 
several bills and ordinances pass—touted as estab­
lishing more transparency or expediting progress 
toward active transportation—that ended up being 
ineffective. Like the 2010 Complete Streets manual. 
Or the 2008 “3 foot” biker law, which forbids driv­
ers from getting closer than three feet to cyclists—
and is hardly enforced. Or the 2020 city-led and 
mayor-backed Safe Routes for All plan with highly 
researched proposals for top-priority roads. In this 
roadmap, a protected bike lane runs through Chapel 
Street. In the most recent conversion plan—even 
with the eleven million dollar grant—the street is 
to be renovated without a bike lane entirely. Despite 
hopes, the Resource Allocation Committee joins 
this list of fruitless efforts. Passing the legislation, as 
it turns out, is the easy part. 


“I’m realizing how naive it is to say it now, that 
suddenly it would just happen,” Rocke said, “If you 
read [Safe Routes for All], it was meant to be: if a 
road is touched you have to add a bike lane, you have 
to add a sidewalk, you have to consider all users of 
that road whenever the road is touched. And I real­
ized, without activists policing that and hounding 
people for it, it doesn’t happen.” 


Activists have felt not only let down but betrayed. 
Safe Streets activist Lior Trestman pointed out that, 
in the original 189-page grant proposal for Chapel 
Street, the phrase “bike lanes” was mentioned 157 
times, and the city included a letter of support from 
him when he thought the plan would have bike lanes. 
After securing the grant funding, the city is now

walking back on its words. “We are totally jaded to 
the idea that there’s anything to advocacy that is pro­
ductive,” Trestman told me, “We have not worked to 
build the [coalition] because it feels like it’s all in vain.” 


When I brought up activists’ concerns that the 
city was diverging from the Safe Routes for All plan, 
Mayor Elicker pointed out the reality of how Chapel 
Street has limited room to accommodate bikers, yet 
many small businesses there need parking spaces 
to thrive. Elicker admires street safety activists for 
their dedication and for expressing their concerns, 
especially as someone who walks and bikes himself. 
Trying to balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, 
and drivers, however, “takes a lot of hard decisions.” 
In the meantime, he said, New Haven is at least more 
proactive than neighboring cities, and in recent years, 
fatalities have gone down—from twenty-one in 2020 
to eleven in 2023. 


For the activists, though, change isn’t happen­
ing fast enough. Trestman loves New Haven. But he 
thinks that in the future, when he’s thinking about 
having children, he would 
not in good conscience let 
them bike, walk, or play 
on New Haven streets. If 
the time comes and dras­
tic changes have yet to 
be made, he’ll move away. 
“Call a spade a spade,” he 
said. At a certain point, you 
have to let go.  


VI. Blueprint
Rocke had imagined 
the Safe Routes for All 
roadmap as a binder on 
an important shelf in City 
Hall, and each time a road is 
slated to be repaved, officials 
would simply flip to the 
right page and see what’s 
already 
been 
researched 
and signed off on by the 
alders. It should be that easy, 
activists tell me; it should be 
“cookie-cutter.”


Even when he was 
Director of Transportation, 
Hausladen felt his pro­
gressive vision frustratingly 
curbed. He needed alders 
to approve his proposals, 
and his attempts at collab­
oration were often petty 
and futile: “‘Hey, can we 
talk about this bike lane?’ 
They’re like, ‘Sure, but I got 
a parking ticket last week 
and I’m pissed at you, so 
I’m going to not call you 
back for two months.’” 


To begin with, the city needs to dedicate more 
effort to outreach, Hausladen said. This could look 
like a database with project statuses—which the 
city promised activists in the past but did not 
come to fruition. For the Resource Allocation 
Committee, this would mean releasing a milling 
and paving list years in advance. Activists would 
then have time to properly engage with the com­
munity and compile fleshed-out, supported plans 
for change. 


Secondly, in New Haven, the public works 
and transportation departments reside in two dif­
ferent cabinets and operate separately. The engi­
neers and designers on the transportation team 
must plan lane striping changes depending on 
the public works team’s progress. Uniting them, as 
Mayor Michelle Wu did in Boston when she took 
office in 2021, would synchronize the departments 
and reduce communication hiccups. 


Most of all, though, New Haven needs a 
visionary. Activists believe that the current trans­
portation director is too embroiled in day-to-
day minutiae to have time for big-picture ideas. 
Chaoulideer wants to see a dedicated transporta­
tion coordinator. Someone with gumption, who 
will stake political capital to advocate within the 
government for cohesive, radically safe streets. 
This idea isn’t unpopular in New Haven—Elicker 
himself proposed such a role last year—but, due 
to a limited budget, the alders cut it.


Change isn’t impossible. Recently, Alder 
Caroline Tanbee Smith of East Rock and Fair 
Haven, with several other alders, secured a two 
million dollar federal grant to redesign streets 
and neighborhoods rendered treacherous and 
half-constructed by the Oak Street Connector. 
As they wait, activists and residents grow 
tired. Often, as we spoke, Rocke would put on 
a faux-hurt air and joke, “I’m not saying any­
one has an obligation to tell Rob Rocke what’s 
going on.” But that’s the reality. As they track 
down changes and push the city to fulfill their 
promises, they’re often left in the dark. Activists 
have shifted their energy toward a more tangi­
ble effort: erecting memorials for those killed on 
New Haven streets. 


VII. Phantom
On a windy december evening, Safe Streets 
leaders met to discuss the implementation of 
red light cameras. But Chaoulideer is bitterly 
hesitant to even call it a coalition anymore. In 
the past, they were a band of activist groups 
across the city, spurred by a shared vision and 
memories of loved ones lost on the streets, with 
their meetings attracting up to fifty attend­
ees. Now, only the core group remains: Rocke, 
Addae, Chaoulideer, Trestman, and less than a 
dozen others. 


Optimists and idealists at heart, they’re still 
driven by the urban planning studies and reports
