i Like to imagine a campus bulletin 
board as one monstrous organism, every 
pinned flyer a new flailing limb. As I walk 
by, it thrashes and wails at me to stop and 
look, that big-headed beast. Sometimes I 
do. There’s always something new. Apply 
to be a Law School summer fellow. Free 
stand-up comedy show last week. Public 
global technology lecture, art gallery video 
series screening, local punk rock band 
performance, 
student clothing sale, 
another one, another. 
Sometimes I even dare to 
disturb the creature, move one 
aside to read another. Lawless. A 
dozen people walk swiftly by. 
There’s something intimate about 
a weathered piece of paper stapled to a 
board. A dozen clashing fonts, frayed 
edges beside fresh ink. Bold and italic 
attempts to entice. There is a tacit life 
in their accumulation, the whispered 
narrative of it all. Someone must make 
them, pin them there. Someone, then, 
must also take them down. I wonder if 
they go one by one, examining each one, 
or if they rip them off in apathetic grabs, 
a crumpled slaughter. Here, everything 
is finite and urgent.∎
