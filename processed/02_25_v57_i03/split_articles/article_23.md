EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“In “Mas’s Shoulder,” I asked my family members to cut out the silhouette of Mas Okamoto, 
my great-grandfather. In the original photo, Mas is wearing a white shirt against a white back­
ground: the outline of his shoulder vanishes. Thus, this exercise of visual memory is an imagina­
tive one, interpreted by family members of different generations.”
