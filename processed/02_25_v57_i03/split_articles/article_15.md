side, a more diverse diet ensures food 
security through better nutrition. Still, 
smaller farms are placed in an arena too 
large, forced to combat a system that 
prioritizes monoculture.

To further assist farmers, the USDA’s 
Farm Service Agency moves to ensure 
an “equitable delivery” of Farm Loan 
Programs. However, trouble paying off 
loans and accumulating interest only 
land farmers in more debt. 

“No farmer needs another loan,” 
says Chris Bassette, co-head farmer at 
Killam & Bassette Farmstead in South 
Glastonbury, CT. “That was the one 
thing we kept hearing from town offi­
cials, state officials, federal officials.”

The incomes of Connecticut farmers 
have nearly doubled from 14,941 dol­
lars to 28,428 dollars between 2017 and 
2022, according to the Department of 
Agriculture. But in the face of decreasing 
food profits and high supply-chain costs, 
farms—especially dairy farms—struggle 
to support themselves.

Greenbacker’s 
Brookfield 
Farm, 
in Durham, CT, auctioned most of 
their cattle in 2018, ending a legacy of 
dairy farming dating back to 1732. In 
a 2009 testimony before Connecticut’s 
Environment Committee, farmer Joe 
Greenbacker expressed that due to sup­
pressed milk prices, the farm was down 
one hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
in milk income. 

Fluctuating 
food 
prices 
have 
shrunk farmers’ profits. In July 2024, the 
national crop production index was 6.7 
percent lower than in June of the same 
year, meaning farmers received less 
money for their crops. Still, distributor 
prices and labor costs remained high. 
Farmers, then, are thrust into a volatile 
has really drastically changed our diet.”

Post-Green Revolution, desires for 
high crop yield led to an expansion of 
monoculture and the usage of chemical 
fertilizers and GMOs. Such practices have 
resulted in a lack of biodiversity, agro­
chemical pollution of soil, air, and water, 
and increased carbon emissions from 
industrial technology use. 

The most profitable farms are those 
that participate in monoculture. This is 
also thanks to the current crop insur­
ance system, which allows farmers to 
insure their crops if they are diseased or 
destroyed due to a climate emergency. 
Large farms in the Midwest grow “cash 
crops”: corn, soybeans, wheat, cot­
ton, and rice. If one of these few crops 
fails, those farms have the resources to 
insure them; government subsidies for 
crop insurance are virtually unlimited. 
For larger farms, high-cost premiums 
allow insurance companies to gain 
government subsidies for their ser­
vices, thus incentivizing them to ser­
vice monoculture farms. According to 
the Government Accountability Office, 
this practice can result in more gener­
ous subsidies for high-income farms.

For those who farm a diverse range 
of crops outside the cash crop realm, 
however, crop insurance is too expen­
sive and lacks accessible options. Aaron 
Taylor is one of the four owners at Four 
Root Farm, in East Haddam, CT, ded­
icated to growing diversified, unique 
crops like shishito peppers and fairy 
tale eggplants. To save money, none of 
his crops are insured. Instead, he hopes 
that if one species dies, he can con­
tinue growing and selling the others. 
Similarly, Dellacamera only insured 65 
percent of each type of crop he grows—
leaving him without the cash to revive 
his barren farm post-hail storm. 

Even the name “cash crop” sets a 
precedent for smaller farmers hoping 
to grow a range of produce, labeled 
“specialty crops.” “They call us specialty 
crops, but we don’t have specialty rules. 
We still got to fall under the rules of the 
green guy,” Dellacamera tells me. By 
the “green guy,” Dellacamera refers to 
larger farms that can afford insurance.

Specialty crops, however, aren’t 
merely a necessary evil for smaller 
farmers—they are imperative to envi­
ronmental strength and consumer 
health. Specialty crops provide biodi­
versity, better soil health, and a crop 
rotation that can resist climate emer­
gencies and diseases. On the consumer 
market. “It is really easy to go underwa­
ter,” Taylor says.

“It’s tough because labor is so expen­
sive, and then [there’s] all of your insur­
ance, your feed bills, your fuel,” Megan 
Hastings says. She owns Hastings 
Farm, one of only eighty-seven surviv­
ing dairy farms in Connecticut, a sharp 
decline from 210 in 2009. In 2009, the 
Hastings faced a similar struggle to the 
Greenbackers, almost selling their cows 
and the farm entirely.

“You worked all day and knew, at 
the end of the day, [that] you would be 
in more debt than when you started,” 
Hastings tells me.


Chris Bassette and her husband 
Kevin Bassette, along with their 
94-year-old business partner, Kenry 
Killam, have found innovative ways 
to secure extra income to support the 
farm. Similar to Dellacamera, they host 
haunted events at their farm known as 
“spooky strolls.” The farm also sells crops 
in fifteen different markets a week, rents 
out an Airbnb, and offers catering. “It’s 
great to have the consumer come and get 
to meet us and talk to us, but it’s a lot of 
work, and I would love to not have to do 
it,” Chris Bassette says.

and co-owner of CT Greenhouse. “It 
wasn’t working for me to make [the 
amount of money] I was making, which 
is sad, and I wish that hadn’t been the 
case,”  Taylor says.

Managing a business and accruing 
side hustles have become integral to a 
farmer’s daily routine, and the demand­
ing schedule can cause mental health 
battles and burnout. More young farm­
ers are quitting. The national average 
farming age is around sixty. And among 
the younger farmers who want to begin 
farming, many lack land access and 
struggle with land affordability. 

Some, however, have surpassed the 
hurdles and choose to stay.

“We are not growing the next giant 
business that can do it differently, but 
to be one of many small farms who 
are doing differently,” Taylor says. Four 
Root is comprised of four best friends, 
all farmers between the ages of 39 and 
40. Taylor and his friends chose to enter 
the industry because they wanted to be 
among those changing the face of farm­
ing. “I could just be another person with 
a college degree working for a nonprofit 
trying to support farmers, or I could 
learn to be a farmer in my generation 
and learn to do it well and feed my com­
munity,” Taylor says. 

Though she tried to distance herself 
from her family’s dynasty in her youth, 
Megan Hastings found herself drawn 
to dairy farming. Now, Megan and her 
sister, Lauren Hastings, are commit­
ted to continuing their family’s legacy 
amidst the uncertainty of the dairy 
market. “When we were talking as a 
family about selling the cows, we were 
all gonna get real jobs. It didn’t feel 
right,” she remembers. “I can’t really 
imagine doing anything else.” The 
future of younger farmers, then, lies in 
their resilience and dedication to creat­
ing a new legacy of farming. 

Some farmers are also organizing. The 
New Connecticut Farmers Alliance aims 
to support the future of farming by con­
necting beginner farmers with one another, 
especially BIPOC farmers, a demographic 
often underrepresented in farming. 

For Dellacamera, advocacy starts in 
his tractor. With the support of other 
local Connecticut farmers, Dellacamera 
has driven across Connecticut, sporting 
signs with signatures from local farmers 
across the state––an effort he calls his 
“Will Goes to Washington” movement. 
His last stop was Washington, D.C., 
inside Connecticut Congresswoman 
Rosa DeLauro’s office, where senators 
and USDA officials crowded the room. 

In December, 2024 shortly after 
Dellacamera’s trip to the Capitol, 
DeLauro secured a Disaster Assistance 
Bill, allotting a 220 million dollar grant 
for farmers who underwent climate 
disasters during the 2023 and 2024 sea­
sons in New England states, Hawai’i, 
and Alaska. The bill provides financial 
support to small and medium-sized 
farmers without the requirement for 
crop insurance—a large step for spe­
cialty farmers.

The Disaster Assistance Bill is just 
the start. In Dellacamera’s words to 
Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal 
after the bill was passed, “This isn’t over. 
And there’s a lot that needs to be done.” 

One major contender in this fight 
for the small farmer is the Farm Bill, a 
multiyear bill tracing back to post-De­
pression America. The bill allocated 
428 billion dollars from 2018 to 2023 in 
government funding to support farm­
ers, food-insecure citizens, and environ­
mental protection efforts. Despite being 
renewed every five years, the bill failed to 
pass in both 2023 and 2024 and has now 
been extended to 2025. Democrats and 
Republicans still have not agreed on how 
to fund the bill, and whether nutrition 
and climate programs should be lim­
ited. The longer the renewal of the bill 
is postponed, the longer smaller farmers 
endure crop insurance untailored to them, 
insurance and loan programs that do not 
help them, and new climate issues not 
addressed by the outdated bill.   

This season, Dellacamera’s farm is 
barren. Sitting in his truck, he is quiet as 
he thinks about the future of Cecarelli’s 
Farms. He instead describes how local 
farm-goers marveled at the abundance 
of peppers displayed on his field just 
four days before the hail storm. 

For many, all it can take is a few 
minutes for a livelihood of work to dis­
appear. But Dellacamera is prepping 
for his next harvest—and trip back to 
the Capitol. And while the dirt road 
he drives on is a long one, it is not one 
untaken. In 1979, farmers participated 
in the Tractorcade, driving hundreds 
of miles to Washington D.C. in their 
tractors to protest the foreclosure of 
American farms. Today, Dellacamera 
has four tractors ready to be driven by 
neighboring farmers, all working acre 
by acre to fill what looks like an uncer­
tain future. ∎
