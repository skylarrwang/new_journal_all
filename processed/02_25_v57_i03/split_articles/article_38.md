EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Last August, Yale introduced dozens of 
updated or entirely new policies on 
outdoor spaces. 

unplanned, and no request for permis­
sion to sing on Cross Campus was made 
to the University administration. Other 
student groups have also sold merchan­
dise and tickets on Cross Campus (where 
the sale of goods is prohibited), sung late 
at night on Old Campus, and staked art 
installations into Cross Campus—all 
without administrator pushback.

Though none of these events dis­
rupted campus life or raised complaints, 
they all violated Yale’s new policy, which 
states that its rules are “meant to preserve 
these [outdoor campus] spaces for use by 
everyone.” But no action was taken against 
any of these groups, and many student 
groups continue to use campus spaces and 
post posters on bulletin boards without 
consequences. Yale’s inconsistent enforce­
ment of its new policies raises a larger 
question: if amplified music, impromptu 
structures, and spontaneous singing aren’t 
truly disruptive to campus life, why are they 
restricted in the first place? By creating and 
then inconsistently enforcing new poli­
cies, Yale isn’t preserving campus spaces for 
“everyone”—it’s picking and choosing who 
gets to use them, and for what.


Monitoring Dissent

U
NLIKE THEIR PEER GROUPS who 
continue to use outdoor spaces 
freely, several explicitly pro-Palestine 
student groups have reported increased 
surveillance by administrators, including 
personal phone calls from Montalvo, and 
social media monitoring by the Office 
of the Secretary and Vice President for 
University Life. 

Nadine Cubeisy ’25, a student orga­
nizer, says that her group is often con­
tacted by Montalvo after they post to 
their Instagram. Following a post about 
Yalies4Palestine’s weekly meeting and 
dinner in October, Montalvo emailed 
Cubeisy directly to ask about the gath­
erings. “Our office has been notified 
that your group, Yalies4Palestine, has 
announced weekly gatherings of some sort 
on Tuesday evenings,” Montalvo wrote in 
the email. “However, there was no location 
provided. Do you plan to hold these on 
Cross Campus or Beinecke Plaza? Or do 
you have a different plan in mind?” 

In 
November, 
Yalies4Palestine 
posted to Instagram about a study-in on 
Cross Campus, for which they submit­
ted a form to Yale administration. The 
following morning, Cubeisy received an 
email from Nina Fattore, the Associate 
Director of University Life, saying that the 
“office had been notified that this event is 
already being advertised as a variation of 
the event from last year with the book­
shelves,” and asking whether bookshelves 
or structures would be present. Fattore 
also directed Cubeisy to call Montalvo 
on her personal cell phone. Cubiesy said 
that Montalvo regularly calls her to check 
in on her group’s activities. Montalvo also 
regularly shows up in person at events that 
Cubiesy’s group hosts. 

Last 
September, 
the 
Yale 
Undergraduate Prison Project (YUPP) 
planned a vigil at the Women’s Table to 
mourn the execution of Marcellus Khalifa 
Williams. Though unrelated to pro-Pal­
estinian protest, YUPP had previously 
co-hosted events with Yalies4Palestine and 
endorsed Occupy Yale. Two days before the 
vigil, YUPP posted the details on Instagram. 
The next day, all board members received an 
email from Montalvo requesting they sub­
mit a form for approval. After complying, 
they were granted permission.

Former YUPP co-president Bahar 
Bouzarjomehri ’25 found the timing strange. 
“We hadn’t reached out to any Yale admin 
about this before,” she said. “I really don’t 
know how they found out about the vigil, 
if not by social media monitoring.” To 
Bouzarjomehri, the administration’s email 
and the fact that YUPP is openly supportive 
of Palestine seem connected. “It’s clear to us 
that we’re on some sort of radar,” she said. 

It’s not just administrators: the 
Yale Police Department (YPD) has also 
been deeply involved in surveilling stu­
dent activists through monitoring social 
media, student’s ID swipe history, campus 
camera footage, aerial drone photogra­
phy, and through collaboration with the 
FBI, according to reporting by journalist 
Theia Chatelle ’25. On December 20, 2024, 
Chatelle reported that the YPD not only 
monitored ongoing protests but tried to 
prevent future protests by tracking student 
social media. Emails exchanged between 
YPD compliance and crime analyst Vanessa 
Schencking, and YPD leadership contained 
screenshots of Instagram posts from 
pro-Palestine student groups. Another 
series of internal YPD emails cross-refer­
enced Yalies4Palestine’s Instagram follow­
ers with students who were registered to 
attend Spring Fling, following a sugges­
tion by YPD Director of Compliance and 
Strategic Initiatives Lisa Skelly-Byrnes 
that pro-Palestinian students might try to 
organize a protest at Spring Fling.

This invasive surveillance of pro-Pal­
estinian students by Yale police and 
administrators raises serious concerns 
about student privacy. More troublingly, 
Yale’s systematic tracking and monitor­
ing of student activists points to a con­
certed effort to silence dissent, particularly 
from pro-Palestine groups on campus. 

For Arjun Warrior ’26, who is an orga­
nizer with the Yale Endowment Justice 
Coalition, the situation is clear: “The 
fact that new rules have only been cre­
ated now, in response to pro-divestment 
and pro-Palestine protests, suggests that 
admin’s goal isn’t actually to enforce time, 
place, and manner restrictions. It’s to shut 
down speech that the board of trustees 
doesn’t want to hear,” he said. 


Space as Speech

F
oR 
DECADES, 
Yale’s 
outdoor 
spaces—Beinecke Plaza in particular—
have been used as sites of student protest, 
including anti-war art installations in the 
1960s, anti-apartheid encampments in 
the 1980s, and fossil fuel divestment pro­
tests in 2020. It was this long history of 
student activism that inspired organizers 
last spring to make Beinecke the site of 
pro-divestment and pro-Palestine cam­
pus protests. 

To many faculty and students, Yale’s 
decision to restrict student access to public 
spaces immediately after a major student 
protest feels like a direct attack on protest 
activity. At Yale, and everywhere, space 
and free expression are inherently linked, 
says Roderick Ferguson, a professor of 
Women’s, Gender, & Sexuality Studies 
and American Studies at Yale whose work 
examines the relationship between uni­
versities and student protest. “One of the 
tools that’s in the activist toolkit is space 
and the use of space, because you’ve got to 
have your protest somewhere,” Ferguson 
explained. “That involves plazas, that 
means quad areas like Cross Campus, that 
involves buildings.” Yale itself acknowl­
edges the connection between space and 
free expression: its new policies about out­
door space use are consolidated in a sec­
tion titled “Free Expression at Yale” on the 
website for the Office of the Secretary and 
Vice President for University Life.  

In its official communications and 
on its Free Expression at Yale website, 
Yale emphasizes its commitment to free 
expression, writing that “the free exchange 
of ideas…is essential to our goal of excel­
lence…across the university.” 

“To say that those spaces are no lon­
ger available for political uses is a way to 
remove that tool from the activist tool­
kit,” said Ferguson. “You have an effort to 
narrow the possibilities for activism, and 
in that way, the university is abdicating a 
very clear mission about what a university 
is.” 

Student organizers are finding ways 
to continue their activism, even with the 
growing sense that public spaces at Yale 
are becoming less accessible. For Cubeisy, 
the process has become a strange sort of 
routine: filling out forms for approval, 
back-and-forth emails with Montalvo’s 
office. She sends me screenshots of their 
exchanges—negotiating the details of the 
Cross Campus study-in on November 4 
and the Books Not Bombs referendum 
announcement on Beinecke Plaza on 
November 6. When Montalvo calls again 
on November 5, it’s to tell her that orga­
nizers are not allowed to block count­
er-protesters from filming them.

On the day of the study-in, students 
wrapped in blankets and keffiyehs sat in 
groups on Cross Campus, writing letters to 
University Provost Scott Strobel. Cubiesy 
moved among them, pausing to greet 
friends, smiling. You’d never guess the logis­
tics behind it all—the forms, the emails, the 
calls, the fact that, at Yale, protesting means 
first having a personal phone conversation 
with a university administrator.

On December 8, Books Not Bombs 
passed. “Almost half of the Yale student 
body voted, and students overwhelm­
ingly voted YES for disclosure, divestment, 
& reinvestment in Palestinian schol­
ars & studies,” @sumudyale posted on 
Instagram. “Yale Board of Trustees, the 
students have spoken. It’s your turn now.”

Despite the new policies, the paper­
work, the calls, the quiet absurdity of 
negotiating activism over the phone, and 
the growing sense that public spaces are 
no longer fully theirs to use, student orga­
nizing continues. ∎
