one year i rose & 
there was snow smothering the leaves i 
watched a flake drift over the flowers bloomed 
a robin swallowed & recoiled & 
the earth seemed as if everything had lost  
its name 
may
may forgetful snow fall here my 
memories repackaged & served in dust 
& gradually the hills filled with the tremors of 
earth undug & the groundhogs took cover 
it became a land of corn & snow 
the rows ornamented in perpetual christmastime 
(that was the only holiday we celebrated here) 
in the end jesus would die again 
(& where would we crucify him? in the chicken  
coops his arms splayed against crushed beaks 
& broken wings brown his arms like mine & yet) 
he dies he dies again because who is willing to die 
for their sins of plastic bags & 
pedals pressed  
oh lord this earth was never ours to begin with let 
the rivers overflow so it can feel what it is to 
be human let us drown in its salted  
tears dance ourselves off the face of 
Earth until we have undone the ground & its 
toiled soil & then we shall return to
