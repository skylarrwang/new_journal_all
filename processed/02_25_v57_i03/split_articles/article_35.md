“I
t was once a beautiful place 
to live,” Elizabeth Yarbrough told 
me when I asked about Westville 
Manor, her old home. She moved to the 
affordable housing complex in 1993 to 
raise her sons, who thrived in the nearby 
woods and “family-oriented” community. 
“My house was always open to the kids,” 
she told me, smiling. 
Today, toppled grills and boarded 
windows line the dead-end streets of the 
Manor. The concrete units in a remote 
northwest fringe of New Haven seem 
more like barracks than the cute town­
houses Yarbrough recalled.
Six years ago, the city approved a 
plan for redevelopment. In prepara­
tion for the first phase of demolition 
in spring of 2020, the housing author­
ity forced residents on the north side of 
the Manor to relocate. Now, the promise 
of renewal seems empty—units which 
were cleared out have new tenants, and 
the Manor remains untouched, isolated, 
and in physical decay.
Politicians 
and 
developers 
fre­
quently pledge to build affordable hous­
ing. But the path to completed and 
thriving homes is slow, and subject to 
greed, bad planning, and discrimina­
tion. Westville Manor, and the fifteen 
acres on which it stands, knows these 
struggles too well. The land has hosted 
two failed affordable housing complexes 
over the course of fifty five years: first, 
a public housing project by a celebrity 
architect that promised radical change; 
next, its disconnected and poorly main­
tained replacement, Westville Manor. 
The story of this land illustrates how 
stigma, mismanagement, and corrup­
tion have plagued affordable housing 
developments in New Haven, upending 
the lives of residents.


P
aul Rudolph moved to New Haven 
in 1958, appointed by Yale to chair the 
Department of Architecture. During his 
time at the university, Rudolph devel­
oped a keen interest in designing build­
ings using prefabricated mobile home 
units. With their low cost and efficient 
construction, Rudolph believed pre­
fab would be the solution to America’s 
housing crisis.
When Rudolph arrived in New 
Haven, Mayor Richard Lee’s urban 
renewal mega-project was just under­
way. The two men collaborated on a 
number of structures during Lee’s ten­
ure, including Temple Street Parking 
Garage in 1961 and Crawford Manor in 
1966, a housing complex for the elderly. 
In 1968, they began their final project 
together: Oriental Masonic Gardens, 
a federally funded housing complex 
for low-income families constructed 
of prefabricated units and located on 
the site of present day Westville Manor. 
The proposal came on the heels of the 
race riots in the summer of 1967. For 
Lee, the development was a chance 
to improve his relationship with New 
Haven’s Black community. When it 
opened, approximately 75 percent of 
the families living in the Gardens 
were Black, an attempt to racially inte­
grate racially integrating West Rock, a 
predominantly white neighborhood. 
Additionally, the experimental use of 
prefab was a chance for New Haven 
to again receive national recognition, 
attention Lee had basked in during 
urban renewal in the 1950s. The mayor 
unveiled Rudolph’s sketches in the 
presence of George Romney, Nixon’s 
Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, in 1969; much to Lee’s 
delight, the press closely followed along.
The vast majority of affordable hous­
ing complexes at the time were highrises 
in dense urban areas. The Gardens 
were much the opposite, consisting of 
148 homes spread across wooded ter­
rain. Each home consisted of two or 
three modular units made of plywood 
stacked on top of each other. Unlike 
most public housing projects, Oriental 
Masonic Gardens was managed as a 
non-profit cooperative. Residents could 
own their units, as opposed to renting 
them. Rita Reif of The New York Times 
wrote an overwhelmingly optimistic 
article, “Thanks to Prefabs, Out of the 
Slums and Into Their Own Co-Ops,” in 
February of 1972, six months after the 
Gardens opened. Reif portrayed happy 
families and described the complex as 
“meticulously maintained,” suggesting 
that the “pride of ownership and sense 
of community involvement was evident.” 
Seven years later, the development was 
slated for demolition.
Oriental Masonic Gardens faced 
nearly every challenge imaginable. The 
development was originally budgeted 
for 3.4 million dollars, but the prefab 
units were more expensive than antic­
ipated; there was little precedent from 
which to estimate cost. All told, the 
Gardens went 450,000 dollars over 
budget, even as developers cut cor­
ners to save money: units sat on con­
crete posts instead of full foundations; 
unprotected pipes froze in the winter; 
residents, the New Haven Housing 
Authority helped fund the construc­
tion of a fence separating Hamden 
from West Rock’s housing projects. The 
oppressive barrier stood in the near 
vicinity of the Gardens and Manor, a 
symbol of racial and class animosity that 
stood until 2014. When Yarbrough lived 
in the Manor, she described two-minute 
drives to Hamden taking thirty, thanks 
to the fence. As New Haven Mayor 
Toni Harp worked to take the wall 
down, Hamdenites pushed back; one 
told The New York Times, “We don’t want 
the thugs on the corner, the cars racing 
through here.”
one resident described having to hold 
an umbrella while cooking—roofs 
didn’t fit units and often leaked. The 
co-op defaulted on payments in 1978, 
leaving the project in the hands of the 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) and the New 
Haven Housing Authority. 
Despite the negligence in construc­
tion, much of the blame for the decay 
at the Gardens was directed towards 
the co-op owners, architectural histo­
rian Sean Khorsandi explained to me. 
Articles from the time cast residents 
derisively as “people who couldn’t take 
care of things, who were used to living 
in apartments and weren’t used to main­
taining a yard,” Khorsandi said.  
Affordable housing was stigmatized 
even when it was owned and man­
aged by a government agency. In the 
early 1950s, to appease white Hamden 


By the time demolition of the 
Gardens was announced in November 
of 1979, half of the decomposing units 
had been abandoned; everyone who was 
able to leave had done so. The remaining
sixty families were relocated by the state.

Oriental Masonic Gardens was “all but 
forgotten by the men who produced 
it,” wrote Collins. But it loomed large 
in the minds of those who designed its 
successor.
In December of 1980, the New 
Haven Housing Authority invited pro­
posals from developers for what would 
become Westville Manor. They were 
planning a complex structure nearly 
identical to the Gardens: 158 units, 
ranging from two to five bedrooms, 
spread across the hilly site. The final 
design called for units built on-site 
out of concrete blocks, a reaction to 
Rudolph’s factory-made, plywood fail­
ure. Things would be different this time, 
the developers promised. Ownership of 
the project was transferred to the New 
Haven Turnkey Construction Co in 
November 1984, which hired Kantrow 
Construction, 
owned 
by 
brothers 
Michael and Richard Kantrow, to serve 
as the property’s general contractor. 
One month into the project, the 
Kantrow brothers requested an addi­
tional one million dollars from HUD 
to cover “costs incurred as a result of 
unknown subsurface soil conditions.” 
HUD’s Hartford and Boston offices 
denied the request. The Kantrows, work­
ing under a tight budget, kept pushing, 
and HUD’s national office provided them 
an extra eight hundred thousand dollars. 
Westville Manor opened to residents in 
1986, but became ensnared in contro­
versy regarding the Kantrows’ request 
for additional funds. After years of 
investigation, the brothers were indicted 
for conspiracy to defraud the federal 
government. Michael pleaded guilty in 
1994. In the words of one HUD employee, 
the Kantrow case was just the “latest 
chapter” in Westville Manor’s “long and 
tortured history.”


D
espite 
the 
corruption, 
Kantrow-constructed units were 
in good condition when Yarbrough 
arrived in 1993. Fortunes began to 
change in the Manor in 2006, when 
the housing authority started redevel­
oping Brookside Estates and Rockview 
Apartments, temporarily relocating a 
number of residents into the Manor 
and fracturing the tenant community. 
Four years later, the state shut down 
West Rock Nursing Home across the 
street, leading to incessant break-ins, 
graffiti, and overgrowth on the property. 
Without the nursing home’s patients 
and ninety employees coming to work 
each day, the Manor felt more remote 
than before, Yarbrough remembers. The 
Manor homes also started to physically 
deteriorate. Two children were hospi­
talized after part of a unit’s ceiling col­
lapsed in 2013, a structural issue that 
afflicted many of the homes. With phys­
ical decay and the presence of temporary 
residents, “things just went downhill,” 
Yarbrough explained. In May of 2014, 
there were four shootings in the Manor 
in the span of a single week.
By 2018, the project was in a state 
of “obsolescence,” Shenae Draughn, 
president of the New Haven Housing 
Authority, told me. In collabora­
tion with residents and the housing 
authority, Kenneth Boroson Architects 
completed a master plan for the rede­
velopment of Westville Manor in 2019. 
It is the same local firm who designed 
Brookside and Rockview, complexes 
which are considered successful. The 
proposal features two large recreational
