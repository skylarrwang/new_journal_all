spaces. In August 2024, Yale intro­
duced dozens of updated or entirely 
new policies on outdoor spaces, its 
first major change to these policies in 
nearly a decade. Many of the policies 
specifically limit protest activities on 
Beinecke Plaza and Cross Campus—
which not only served as key locations 
of the April demonstrations but also 
as sites with a decades-long history of 
student activism.

If you walk through Yale’s cam­
pus today, you might not notice that 
the university’s policies on the use of 
outdoor spaces have changed. Student 
organizations continue to host sing­
ing sessions, clothing pop-ups, and 
recruitment events, some without the 
required permission from the Office of 
the Secretary and Vice President for 
University Life. At least two student 
leaders I spoke with were unaware of 
the policy changes. Others I spoke to 
continue to use outdoor spaces as they 
did before: without administrator per­
mission or pushback. Meanwhile, a 
few activist groups, especially those 
advocating for Palestinian causes, 
report heightened administrator scru­
tiny, social media surveillance, and 
restrictions on their activities.

Yale’s official policy on free expres­
sion has not changed. But in practice, 
Yale’s new rules restrict students’ abil­
ity to protest on campus. Furthermore, 
Yale’s inconsistent enforcement of its 
new policies suggests that the uni­
versity designed the policies to limit 
student protest while appearing to 
uphold free speech.

A
t 4 p.m. on any of yale’s out­
door spaces, no one can sing. No 
one can chant or play instruments, 
except from 12 to 1 p.m. and 5:30 to 6:30 
p.m. on a weekday, with prior permission. 
No one can hang a flag from a college 
window, lean a painting against a wall, 
or place a sculpture on Cross Campus 
or Beinecke Plaza. Any works of art, 
left unattended, are banned.

Before last April, Yale’s rules on 
using outdoor spaces, postering, chalk­
ing, and light projection had remained 
largely untouched since 2016. Yet as 
student-led protests and encampments 
pressuring Yale to divest from arms 
manufacturers swept across campus 
last spring, the administration revised 
its policies on how, when, and where 
students could gather on campus

that time. Violators included posters from 
the Whitney Humanities Center and 
the Yale University Art Gallery—official 
departments of Yale University.

The postering policy also states that 
posters that don’t adhere to the rules may 
be removed by “authorized staff” weekly. 
I emailed Montalvo and Goff-Crews 
asking them to clarify who the “autho­
rized staff” in charge of poster removal 
are—Goff-Crews 
replied, 
“Various 
staff at the university are authorized to 
remove posters that do not comply with 
the guidelines.” I continued to return to 
the same bulletin boards over the course 
of the six weeks and did not witness any 
of the posters in violation of guidelines 
removed. However, on December 1, 2023, 
when pro-divestment protestors posted 
a sixty-foot banner listing the names of 
thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza 
since October 2023 on the front door of 
Woodbridge Hall, Montalvo permitted a 
Yale student—one who did not meet the 
definition of “authorized staff” as outlined 
in Yale’s policy—to remove the banner. 

Between August 19, when the updated 
outdoor space use policies took effect, and 
November 5, the Office of the Secretary 
and Vice President for University Life 
approved eighty-seven group applications 
for use of Cross Campus and Beinecke 
Plaza, according to Goff-Crews. But stu­
dent groups have continued to hold events 
in outdoor spaces without administrator 
permission. 

On September 17, Yale Club Jump 
Rope held an outreach event for first-year 
students on Beinecke Plaza where they 
amplified music at 4:30 p.m., outside of 
the allowed time frame. A leader of the 
club confirmed that the group had not 
requested permission and was not ques­
tioned or confronted by any administra­
tors. On September 14, the Yale LGBTQ 
Center—a 
university-funded 
depart­
ment—held a pop-up giveaway of clothes 
and shoes on Cross Campus which 
included a clothes rack that could be clas­
sified as a “structure” according to Yale’s 
policy. A student who staffed the pop-up 
confirmed that the group didn’t email 
anyone to request use of the space, and 
added that nobody questioned whether 
the group was allowed to be there. On the 
night of September 16, Yale Nigun Circle, 
a group that typically meets on Monday 
nights in the Slifka Center for Jewish 
Life to sing wordless melodies and rounds, 
held a spontaneous singing circle on Cross 
Campus at 10 p.m. According to a group 
leader, the gathering was informal and 
“Unlike their peer 
groups who
continue to use outdoor 
spaces freely, several 
explicitly pro-Palestine 
student groups have 
reported increased 
surveillance by 
administrators.”

On August 19, 2024, the Office of 
University Life published at least thirty 
new or updated policies on their website 
for the use of outdoor space, postering, 
chalking, light projection, and public­
ity. Prior to the April protests, these pol­
icies were generally permissive, as long 
as student activities showed “respect for 
university property and the rights of oth­
ers.” Now, restrictions are much more 
specific, regulating everything from stu­
dent art installations to where flags and 
banners can be hung, and defining six­
ty-minute slots for “singing, chanting, 
shouting, playing instruments, or using 
other noisemakers” in public spaces on 
weekdays. The use of Cross Campus by 
any groups in the month of May is now 
banned—without exception—to “prepare 
for commencement.” Yale has run 323 
commencements without such a policy. 

Selective Enforcement
Y
ET IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AROUND 
Yale’s 
bulletin 
boards—by 
the 
Women’s Table, 
York 
Street 
entrance to Old Campus, or in front of 
William L. Harkness Hall—you’ll find 
they’re often overflowing with posters that 
don’t follow university guidelines. Under 
Yale’s new regulations, only one unique 
poster can exist on each board, and every 
poster must include the sponsoring orga­
nization. Beginning in September 2024, I 
spent six weeks observing bulletin boards 
on campus and documented forty-seven 
violations of the postering policy during 

A Swift Response
W
HEN ASKED WHETHER the new 
policies were created or updated 
in response to pro-divestment protests, 
Pilar Montalvo, Assistant Vice President 
for University Life, and  Kimberly Goff-
Crews, Secretary and Vice President for 
University Life, responded in an email 
that the policies had been “reviewed in 
the summer of 2024 and some changes 
were made to clarify and provide addi­
tional details intended to be helpful to 
members of the university community.” 

But the timeline of the policy changes 
suggests that they were not just “clarified” 
or “updated” as claimed, but specifically 
enacted to curb activist actions and pre­
vent further pro-Palestine protests such 
as those in April.

Yale made its first policy change after 
student organizers built a six-foot-tall 
wooden bookshelf on Beinecke Plaza and 
filled it with hundreds of works of anti-co­
lonialist literature on April 16, 2024. The 
structure, part of a protest called “Books, 
Not Bombs,” urged Yale to divest from 
weapons-manufacturing companies that 
fuel global conflict, with a focus on Israel’s 
war on Gaza. Minutes after the make­
shift library’s completion around noon, 
Montalvo ordered students to remove it, 
citing a university policy that states that 
“pathways and entryways to buildings must 
be kept clear and accessible.” When stu­
dents did not comply, Montalvo directed 
Yale facilities workers to dismantle the 
structure. The Yale Daily News reported that 
for the hour the shelves stood, students and 
pedestrians were still able to pass through 
Beinecke Plaza to Schwarzman Center on 
either side of the bookshelf. In photos from 
the event, the bookshelf structure spanned 
about a third of the width of Schwarzman 
Plaza, with space on either side. 

On April 22, a week after the book­
shelves 
were 
removed, 
Goff-Crews 
emailed the student body to “clarify”  Yale’s 
position on structures. Prior to that email, 
the university policy on structures did not 
exist on the Office of the Provost website. 
The new policy prohibits the placement of 
any structure, broadly defined as “structure, 
wall, barrier, tent, sculpture, artwork, or 
other object,” on any Yale outdoor space 
without written permission from the 
space’s administrator. After the admin­
istration removed the library, protests 
escalated to a multi-day encampment on 
Beinecke Plaza which culminated in the 
arrests of forty-seven protesters, at least 
forty-four of whom were students.
