“Since Soviet times, the safest place in Russia is the kitchen,” says Anna Biryukova, Head of Public Opinion Research and political polling at Russia’s largest democratic opposition group, the Anti-Corruption Foundation. Biryukova addressed an audience at Henry R. Luce Hall in October 2024. “In modern Russia, you cannot have a casual political conversation with a stranger at a bus stop. You cannot say you don’t like Putin. It’s simply not pos­sible. 100 percent not possible.”

The chilling effect of repression in Russia has turned even ordinary conver­sations into a risk, as Russian media proj­ects a fantastic majority supporting those in power. “They want you to feel if you are not with them, you are nothing, you are all alone. And, if you object, there will be consequences,” Biryukova continued. Following its dissolution by Putin’s government in 2021, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which is usually referred to by its Russian acro­nym FBK, now oper­ates from Vilnius, Lithuania. With 135 employees, the FBK uses social media, investigative jour­nalism, and grass­roots organizing to expose corruption, counter state narratives, and build toward a democratic future for Russia. Engaging a predominantly young audience, their YouTube news channels—boasting 6.37 million subscribers and over 1.58 billion views—rival live viewership of Russian state TV, making them one of the most influential independent voices against Putin’s Russia. From the fbk’s new head­quarters in Lithuania, Biryukova con­tinues to gauge public sentiment inside Russia, disguising calls with a local Russian number to elude state surveillance. Since Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the FBK has faced a grim reality: the opposi­tion’s momentum had plateaued while the crackdown on dissent intensified. Journalists and lawyers affiliated with the movement live under constant threat. Associating with or donating to the FBK, which exists off of private donations and crowd-funding, can lead to charges of extremism, treason, or aiding an “anti-state” entity. 

The FBK has operated leaderless since February 16, 2024, when its founder, Alexei Navalny, died in a Russian penal colony in the Arctic Circle where he was serving a 19-year prison sentence.

As the war broke out, Navalny urged his team from prison to think long-term, and prepare for a democratic Russian future, albeit one kicked down the line. “He had an ongoing idea that educa­tion was the greatest value,” Biryukova recalled. “Not only for his kids, for every­one in his working and friend circle.”

For Navalny, the Yale World Fellows program, Yale’s global leadership ini­tiative which he attended in the fall of 2010—a year before he founded the FBK—embodied this vision. The Yale World Fellows program is a semes­ter-long residency for mid-career profes­sionals. The program was established in the early 2000s, at the urging of former University President Richard Levin, who wanted to bring Yale to the forefront of post-Cold War global democracy efforts. Yale provided Navalny access to U.S. and global political networks and a platform to refine his anti-corruption strategy, elevating his profile internationally. Yet, the experience came at some cost. Back home, Kremlin propaganda smeared Navalny’s association with Yale as evi­dence of Western collusion.

Leonid Volkov—Biryukova’s hus­band, Navalny’s close ally, and former chief of staff—and Biryukova both became World Fellows, in 2018 and 2024, respectively, following in Navalny’s footsteps. When they applied to the fellowship, Navalny provided them with letters of recommendation. Their acceptance and participation in the pro­gram reflected a growing recognition of Navalny’s opposition movement by the University. Now, without their leader, the FBK pushes on–mobilizing a global network Navalny began to build at Yale.

Alexei Navalny was born in 1976 in the small town of Butyn outside of Moscow to a modest family—his father, a former Soviet Army officer, and his mother, an economist. Raised in a series of garrison towns, Navalny spent summers with his paternal grandmother near Chernobyl, Ukraine. The 1986 disas­ter, coupled with the Soviet govern­ment’s deliberate attempt to down­play the scale of the catastrophe, would later shape his staunch anti-cor­ruption stance. Navalny’s educa­tion in economics and law in Moscow laid the founda­tion for his future political activism. In 2000, he aligned himself with the lib­eral Yabloko party, which championed a free market economy and a strong civil society. In 2008, he launched a stakeholder activism campaign that targeted five state-owned Russian oil and gas compa­nies. By purchasing small shares in these companies, he gained access to corporate meetings and internal documents detail­ing their financial assets. With this, he exposed widespread corruption within the companies. His findings, published on his widely-read LiveJournal blog begin­ning in 2008, quickly drew the attention of then-President Dmitry Medvedev, who, three years later, caved to public and governmental pressure to acknowl­edge the staggering embezzlement hap­pening within state-controlled industries.

Navalny’s fearless use of the internet as a platform to reveal the Kremlin’s corrup­tion earned him the moniker “Russia’s Julian Assange” from The New Yorker. Navalny applied to the Yale World Fellows program in 2009, backed by recommendations from prominent Russian dissenters. He realized that to effectively target Russian oligarchs fun­neling state funds abroad, he needed to understand U.S. and U.K. money laun­dering laws. He also hoped to study American party politics, checks and balances, and the mechanics of suc­cessful elections—insights he aimed to apply back home in Russia.

Leslie Powell, a former Yale World Fellows admissions officer, remembers Navalny “stumbling” through the admis­sions interview, emailing afterward to apologize for his English. “But even then it was clear he was onto something big,” Powell said. 

The Yale World Fellows program has supported four hundred fellows across ninety-six countries in its global leadership programming, boasting a more competitive entry rate than Yale College. Political dissidents stood out in a program that typically prioritized government leaders, entrepreneurs, jour­nalists, artists, scientists, and humanitari­ans—“people who are moving the needle in some way via different pathways,” as current director Emma Sky said. Only three fellows—Navalny, Turkish intel­lectual Hakan Altinay, and Nicaraguan activist Félix Maradiaga—have faced political exile or imprisonment. 

In August of 2010, 34-year-old Alexei Navalny settled into a condo on New Haven’s Prospect Street with his wife, Yulia, and their young children, Dasha and Zakhar. Navalny immedi­ately found a primary school for six-year-old Dasha, enrolled his family in the Yale healthcare system, and rented a car so the Navalnys could get around the city from their lodging up the hill. 

He lent his car to his neighbors, other World Fellows who had also brought their families along—Nicaraguan fellow Ricardo Terán, South Sudanese fellow Lumumba Di-Aping, and United Kingdom fellow Marvin Rees. These four would gather in the warmer months on each other’s stoops, drinking wine and talking politics, trading recipes from their respective countries, and setting up for their children’s first Halloweens. 

A lanky figure with piercing blue eyes, Navalny carried himself with a measured intensity that drew attention without demanding it. He approached the experience with the mindset of someone intent on absorbing as much as possible. “I firmly believe that all the best things on Earth have been created by brave nerds,” he would later say. 

Navalny’s four months at Yale, in the fall of that year, marked his first extended stay outside of Russia. Even before arriving to the program, Navalny had cast a wide net, determined to lever­age his experiences at Yale to create change back home. According to former World Fellow admissions officer Valerie Belanger’s email records, he made a list of experts at Yale Law School he wished to consult on U.S. and U.K. anti-corrup­tion measures. Once arriving at Yale, he finally reached them—legal and politi­cal corruption scholars like Susan Rose Ackerman and Bruce Ackerman, Cold War historians like John Gaddis, and political economists like Aleh Tsyvinsky. 

In class, Navalny voiced his con­victions with brevity. Before he finished his sentence, peers like Ted Wittenstein and Marvin Rees could comfortably bet the phrase “corrupt Russian government” would leave his mouth. 

For all his clarity of purpose, Navalny’s political past was not without controversy.

Even as classmates admired his resolve, others debated his past rhetoric. Navalny’s neighbors remember debating his annual participation in the “Russian March,” a rally that brought together Russian ultranationalist groups, like neo-Nazis. YouTube videos from 2007 show him likening Moscow migrants to tooth cavities, an issue that he proposed could be “carefully but decisively removed through deportation.”

February 2021, Amnesty International initially revoked the opposition leader’s “prisoner of conscience” status, citing this clip as justification. However, in Oct. 2021, after observing his ongo­ing commitment to a government free of corruption, it reversed this decision, acknowledging in a statement that “an individual’s opinions and behavior may evolve over time.”

Navalny confronted this criticism in his posthumous memoir, Patriot, stating, “I decided that if I, with my democratic val­ues, supported the right of free assembly, I needed to be consistent and support other people’s right to do the same.”

“Look, he’s a product of Russia and Russian politics,” Rees said. “Even though he shared the stage with peo­ple we would find problematic, when I got to Yale, I didn’t find a guy who was acting towards me or any of the other fellows with any sort of individual hos­tility. I didn’t hear tunes of global white supremacy. I met a man who had a north star of corruption in his country, but also someone who was not fixed in his worldview.”

His peers at Yale remember him as disciplined. He jogged each morn­ing. He set off to read, a lot: political strategy, Protestant theology, and The Hunger Games. He admired The Wire television series, and would later model its grassroots organizing in his Moscow mayoral campaigns, insisting his team watch and take notes of the street gath­erings in Baltimore. 

“You know that tacky thing of going somewhere new, being a student, and wanting to be a better version of your­self?” Biryukova asked. “Well, in his case, it actually worked.”
