the stories of the Holocaust, but the 
lives of survivors before and after the 
war. The archive is not static, a room 
tucked away full of tapes. The Fortunoff 
has developed curricula for a variety 
of courses at multiple levels of educa­
tion, with a Teacher Advisory Council 
of educators across the country. The 
archive consults for Holocaust muse­
ums and has advised archival work sur­
rounding other global genocides. 
Today, there are over four thousand 
four hundred recordings, recorded in 
twelve countries and in over twenty lan­
guages. The very first testimonies were 
recorded by survivors in New Haven, 
by a burgeoning organization titled the 
Holocaust Survivors Film Project.
“There is, in each survivor, an imper­
ative need to tell and thus come to know 
one’s story, unimpeded by ghosts from 
the past against which one has to protect 
oneself,” Dori Laub, a child Holocaust 
survivor and Yale professor of psychi­
atry and a founding member of HSFP, 
wrote in his book “Testimony: Crises of 
Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis, 
and History.” “One has to know one’s 
buried truth in order to be able to live 
one’s life.” If we take Laub’s words to be 
true, Fortunoff has granted thousands of 
survivors a kind of second life.
The total digitalization of the tes­
timonies allows deeper engagement 
with the recordings, which can now be 
accessed from any corner of the world, 
with permission from the archive. “The 
archive has transitioned from the active 
collecting, processing, and digital pres­
ervation stage to a new stage in which 
we build on the foundation built by our 
predecessor to enhance access to the 
collection and encourage use of the col­
lection in teaching and research world­
wide,” Stephen Naron, the director of 
the archive, explained. The extraordinary 
act of faith the survivors initiated by 
entrusting Fortunoff with their stories 
has higher stakes now, as the testimo­
nies can reach more people, more rapidly. 
And as the number of living Holocaust 
survivors dwindles, the preservation of 
memory becomes even more urgent. As 
the Fortunoff Archive steps into the 
moment for which it was created, who is 
there to meet it? 

D
ori Laub and Laurel Vlock began 
videotaping four Holocaust survi­
vors in an office in New Haven on a 
May evening in 1979. They began at 6:30 
p.m., and remained long after midnight. 
Vlock, a television reporter, and 
Laub turned their interviews into 
an archive. The Holocaust Survivors 
Film Project officially launched in 
June of 1979, in the home of William 
Rosenberg, who led a local labor zion­
ist organization that HSFP had used to 
contact survivors. A month later, sur­
vivors poured into his home for what 
would be the second recording session 
of their stories. HSFP board members 
and volunteers turned kitchens and 
living rooms into makeshift meeting 
rooms, discussing their plan to tape 
more testimonials and map the future 
of their newfound organization. 

I
t was in class at Yale that I first 
watched 
my 
great-grandparents’ 
testimony of Holocaust survival. I 
expected some kind of great emo­
tional release, but it never came. My 
great-grandfather felt somewhat masked, 
still withdrawn, just out of my grasp—
his demeanor remained stoic while he 
attempted to describe the indescribable. 
Watching my great-grandmother felt 
like a homecoming.

Thirty six years ago, the Fortunoff 
Video Archives for Holocaust Testimonies 
project made its way to the survivor 
hotspot of Queens, New York where 
Hana and Anschel Kantor recorded their 
memories. These files were then deposited 
in Sterling Memorial Library, perma­
nently absorbed into Fortunoff’s collec­
tion of stories. 

When I arrived at Yale last fall, I 
was nervous in the normal ways, eager 
to find friends and extracurriculars. I 
also knew that I would have to con­
front my great-grandparents’ testimo­
nies. I was too physically proximate to 
the archive—hidden behind a nonde­
script, brown door on the third floor of 
Sterling Memorial Library—to ignore 
them. It didn’t help that an exhibit by 
the Fortunoff, titled “In the First Person” 
had just gone up in the Beinecke. Each 
time I passed the gargantuan white cube, 
I thought of my great-grandmother 
and her strange connection to the place 
where I now study. 

The Fortunoff Video Archive for 
Holocaust Testimonies was the first of 
its kind. It pioneered audiovisual tes­
timony as a medium to record not just 
unanswerable: What was the worst part? 
I found it nonsensical. How does one 
dare to ask a survivor of multiple camps 
what “the worst” part of their experience 
was? How could she ask him to measure 
the weight of the many massacres he 
witnessed? But his answer was simple: 
“Anyone could kill you.” 

Relatives know that Holocaust sur­
vivors can be separated into two groups: 
those who speak about the war, and 
those who remain silent. 

My great-grandfather Anschel died 
in 1994, eleven years before I was born, 
but my most treasured memories are of 
my dear Gigi Hana, tumbling around a 
then-crumbling home purchased with 
German reparations checks. 

Hana had dramatic red nails, made 
shining 
golden 
chicken 
soup, 
and 
answered every single question I asked her. 
Anschel, I’m told, was much more reserved. 
But this was the beauty of the Fortunoff: 
survivors who rarely spoke of the horrors 
they witnessed were granted a vessel. 

My beloved great grandmother 
passed away in 2023. I said goodbye to her 
as she cried out for her mother in Polish, 
a language I had never heard her speak. 

T
he Beinecke exhibit 
on 
the 
Fortunoff Archive is timely. We are 
losing survivors by the day, intensifying 
HSFP grew quickly. Geoffrey Hartman, 
a Kindertransport survivor and English 
professor at Yale, joined the ranks and 
requested a grant from the New Haven 
Foundation to support the burgeoning 
organization; the grant was approved 
in 1980. They published newsletters, 
amassed volunteers, and held lengthy 
recording sessions, sometimes record­
ing up to six testimonies in a day. At 
the time, Hartman was building Yale’s 
Judaic Studies program from scratch 
and beginning to see the university as a 
home for these testimonies. 

HSFP had recorded a grand total of 183 
testimonies when they officially deposited 
them in the Manuscripts and Archives 
division of Sterling Memorial Library in 
1981, establishing what would become the 
Fortunoff Video Archive for 
Holocaust Testimonies.

In 1987, the status of the 
testimonies changed from a 
deposit to a permanent dona­
tion. The Fortunoff family, a 
prominent 
Jewish 
jewelry 
retailer, endowed the project, 
giving it the financial freedom 
to live in perpetuity. Esther 
Fortunoff-Greene, who now 
sits on the advisory board of 
the Archive, remembers that 
her parents’ donation was 
driven by their own interac­
tions with survivors in the 
New York City jewelry market.  
HSFP, and then Fortunoff, 
demanded 
extreme 
sensi­
tivity from its interviewers 
and required an extensive 
training process. The inter­
viewer training packet from 
1984-1997 contains a syllabus 
for volunteers and lists train­
ing sessions, required read­
ings, and a fifteen minute 
in-depth interview with an individual of 
the volunteer’s choice, to practice before 
encountering the survivors. They devel­
oped a specific methodology, designed 
to give narrative agency to the survivor. 
The packet included something called the 
“bad questions list,” compiled by JR, pre­
sumably Joanne Rudof, Fortunoff’s origi­
nal archivist. Off the table were questions 
with simple, factual answers (were the 
prisoners old or young?), and questions 
that implied judgement or assumptions.

Thirty six years ago, my great-grand­
father’s interviewer broke the rules. 
When discussing his experience in 
concentration camps, she asked the 
the need for accessible Holocaust tes­
timony. Stephen Naron, the director of 
the archive, explained that “once the 
survivors are gone, archives like this 
will be the only bridge between the 
living and the dead. Listening to testi­
mony is the closest we can get to being 
in a room with a survivor and learning 
from them firsthand.”

Yet, testimony is not a textbook; fac­
tual inaccuracies or conflicting narra­
tives are inevitable. An understanding 
of this nuance informs who can and 
cannot access the archive—currently, 
any researcher can gain access to the 
collection at an access site, and relatives 
of survivors are provided with remote 
access. Gil Rubin, the Director of 
Academic Programs for the Fortunoff, 
explained 
that 
inconsis­
tencies can, in the worst of 
scenarios, lead to Holocaust 
denial. “People will pick and 
choose 
certain 
segments 
and make them appear as 
something they are not,” he 
remarked. These deviations 
expose the human process 
of storytelling—deeply indi­
vidual and rooted in our 
emotional memory. 

I am all too familiar with 
these discrepancies. In her 
stories—at home and in the 
archive—my 
great-grand­
mother spoke with an air 
of tenacity, attributing her 
survival to her own clever­
ness. Stories seemed to bend 
and warp around her, twist­
ing according to whatever 
quick-witted choice she had 
made. When she passed away, 
my mother eulogized her. 
“She was unsparing about the 
devastation, but nearly every 
Holocaust story she told had a com­
mon theme, which is that she, Chanka 
Kantor, was the heroine,” she wrote. 
“She highlighted her daring, her cun­
ning. Her intuition. The time she pulled 
her sisters out of a line bound for exe­
cution. How she warned Grandpa 
Anshel from returning to his home­
town of Kielce where the infamous 
massacre was taking place.” Neither my 
mother nor I accept the premise that 
our shared matriarch was actually more 
intelligent, or more deserving of life, 
than those who perished in the camps. 
This method of narration, as we under­
stand it, was my great-grandmother’s
