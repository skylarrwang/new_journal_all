when then Superintendent Carol Birks 
proposed to close Riverside amid a 30.7 
million dollar budget deficit. The motion 
came less than a year after NHPS had 
merged two other alternative schools with 
Riverside, which at the time had one hun­
dred and thirty-five students. According 
to The New Haven Independent, Birks 
expressed doubt about the success of the 
alternative learning model, citing high 
chronic absence rates.


To push back against Birks’ doubts, 
Riverside students and teachers testified 
in defense of the school. Students tearfully 
shared that they felt cared for by Riverside 
faculty, thanking teachers for providing 
emotional and professional support, as 
reported by The New Haven Independent. 
Teachers highlighted the trust they 
built with their students over the years. 
Riverside survived its second closure threat.


Six years later, Stephenson is confi­
dent the school is not at risk for closure. 
“Riverside is not going anywhere,” he said. 
Since its inception, Riverside has con­
tinued to accommodate students with 
a variety of needs, despite being viewed 
monolithically as a last-resort destination 
for struggling students.


According to staff and faculty, Riverside 
takes on students who struggle to show up 
to school or meet attendance requirements 
due to housing problems. Students who 
are being evicted. Students whose parents 
are incarcerated. Students who are reading 
at very low levels. Students who cannot 
read at all. Some students are 21 years old, 
overaged and under-credited. Others are 
described by teachers as “academically bril­
liant,” but unable to handle stimuli.


No matter the need, Riverside vows to 
meet students where they are.


Dalonna prayed for the boy who killed 
her brother.
“I pray,” she said, pausing to take a 
breath, “that God shows you that there’s 
another way in life but this.”


Just a few hours after the press con­
ference, I met Dalonna in the basement 
office of the Pitts Chapel Unified Free Will 
Baptist Church on Brewster Street. The 
Dalonna I sat down with was much differ­
ent than the public-facing Dalonna from 
earlier that day. She spoke softly with her 
hands folded into her lap, head hung low.
“My brother really was my best 
friend, my confidant, my everything. We 
did everything together,” Dalonna said. 
“When I’m down, I can’t go to nobody else 
because my person is in the ground.”


Growing up in the absence of her 
father, it was her brother, Daily, through 
whom Dalonna often found strength. She 
recalled the sleepless nights when Daily 
would come into her room and sit beside 
her. His presence was enough to reassure 
Dalonna. Daily could light up a room sim­
ply by standing in it.
“He was, if I could be totally honest, 
the only reason why I’m still alive,” she said.


As she mourned the loss of her 
brother, Riverside faculty called and 
checked in on her, sent flowers to the 
house, and sent social workers to sit and 
talk with the family in the first couple 
of weeks after the death. Stephenson 
reached out personally to tell Dalonna 
about his affection for Daily and his 
strengths as a student.
“They were very there emotionally 
for us,” she said. Dalonna is a Riverside 
alum herself. 


F  
or some community members, 
Riverside is part of the problem. 
Three days after Daily’s death, 
family and friends celebrated his life by 
gathering outside at the basketball courts 
on the corner of Ivy Street and Shelton 
Avenue as the sun set, to celebrate 
Daily’s life. The memorial service hon­
ored the late teen with prayers, candle 
lighting, and a balloon release. Among 
the many gathered to mourn the loss was 
Sean Reeves, a community gun violence 
advocate and local business owner. In his 
speech at the gathering, Reeves implored 
youth to stay out of trouble. Thirteen 
years ago, Reeves made the same plea 
before a similar crowd—only that time, 
the memorial was for his son, whom he 
had just lost to gun violence.


Reeves argues that alternative schools 
like Riverside are fundamentally flawed 
because they put kids and their self-es­
teem—particularly their belief in their 
intellectual capabilities—at risk. “Putting 
a label on the kid,” as Reeves says, teaches 
children that they are “bad seeds” and pro­
motes a cycle of disengagement. “Riverside 
should be shut down.”


Reeves’ concerns over Riverside’s 
merits allude to a broader mistrust in the 
system of alternative schooling. ProPublica 
has reported that school districts often 
involuntarily reassign students to alter­
native schools for contestable disciplinary 
reasons like “common decency” and “dis­
respect,” sentencing them to less rigorous 
curriculums and deteriorating facilities.


In 2019, similar doubts emerged 
among the New Haven community 


“We like to come, not just as 
classmates, but as a family,” Faith 
explained.  “We come as a commu­
nity and make sure that we’re here 
to help each other out.”


I  
n the wake of UZZIAH and Daily’s 
deaths, Riverside mobilized its long­
standing systems of support. The 
school, working with the New Haven 
Police Department to bolster student safety, 
employed a full-time school resource officer 
and scheduled more frequent patrol visits. 
The intention, says Chief Jacobson, is not 
to over-police, but to “focus our attention 
there in a positive way.” The Connecticut 
Violence Intervention Program has a staff 
member at the school lead small group dis­
cussions. The school has brought in therapy 
dogs and mental health professionals from 
Clifford Beers Community Care Center. 
The school’s social worker, Lisa Agosto, sat 
down with students to offer one-on-one 
supportive counseling. Students were given 
a pause from schoolwork. 
“The school really supported all of us,” 
Faith explained. To Faith, the school’s 
response mirrored patterns of sup­
port she’s experienced as a student at 
Riverside. Faith appreciated being able 
to take a break from normal coursework 
in the weeks after the loss of her friends. 
On more routine days, too, when she 
feels overwhelmed or unable to engage 
in her school work, she goes to the music 
classroom to listen to or make music, or 
just talk to the music teacher for advice.


Michael Pavano, an art teacher at 
Riverside, expressed that matriculat­
ing at Riverside was about support, not 
punishment.
“It’s about transitioning them, get­
ting them to understand that when you 
come to school, we are going to support 
you. You’re not going to be thrown out 
of class, you’re not going to be suspended 
all the time because you’re not doing this, 
you’re not doing that—that traditional 
environment,” Pavano said.


D’Shawn Coleman, 17, a senior at 
Riverside, can often be found playing 
the piano in Pavano’s art room. D’Shawn 
shared that when he came to Riverside 
as a freshman, he doubted whether he 
would be cared for by the school com­
munity. He entered with a preconceived 
notion about Riverside being a “bad 
school,” and friends and family some­
times belittled him for attending an 
alternative school. Over time, D’Shawn 
grew an appreciation for his peers and 
teachers for the support they provided 
him academically and personally.


He has built meaningful relation­
ships with trusted teachers, which he 
says is rooted in mutual respect and 
seeing that they are “genuinely trying 
to help.” The level of support he has 
received at Riverside, he said, can only 
be found in an alternative setting, which 
he has found easier to adjust to.


For Silvia Sanchez, 17, Riverside’s 
smaller class size of five to eight students 
was the reason why she transferred to the 
school as a sophomore. At Hill Regional 
Career High School, where the school 
population is about seven hundred, 
Silvia felt “claustrophobic” and anxious, 
which took a toll on her mental health 
and school performance. She often 
skipped class because “it was just too 
much.” Since switching to Riverside’s 
more intimate setting, Silvia’s atten­
dance has improved and she has been 
able to keep up with all her assignments.
“I’m doing better here,” she explained, 
“At Career, [the teachers] are busy. There 
are a lot of kids. They can’t even focus 
on one student at a time. But here, you 
know they care for you.”


Riverside holds regular town halls, 
assemblies in the gymnasium, to discuss 
matters of significance with the entire 
student body and teachers.


On a Thursday morning in January, 
thirty students and teachers gathered 
in a semi-circle around a small wooden 
podium for a town hall. Stephenson 
opened the assembly with general 
reminders about school credit require­
ments, attendance rules, and basic 
student 
responsibilities. 
Following 
Stephenson were U.S. Navy recruiters, an 
anti-gun violence advocate, and Aniqua 
Booker, Uzziah’s sister.


Aniqua gave a short speech about 
the power of decision making and resis­
tance to peer pressure. After her brother’s 
passing, she began speaking at Riverside 
town halls. “It just brings me joy and a 
lot of gratitude to try to come out and 
speak…so they know there’s more to 
your life,” Aniqua said. “Right now is not 
the finish line, there’s so much more.”


“We like to come, not just as class­
mates, but as a family,” Faith explained.  


D  
ecember 3rd will always have 
a question mark next to it,” said 
Dalonna. “I’ll never understand 
why my brother was taken from me. I’ll 
never be able to just move on from this, 
because he was such a big part of my life, 
and knowing that my brother died the 
same way my father did, it’ll never be real 
or seem real.”


Like Dalonna, Riverside continues to 
mourn. But its systems of care persist too.


There are teachers at Riverside who 
never want to leave. There are students 
who leave and come back to thank their 
teachers with a hug. There is Stephenson, 
who continues to welcome new students 
with open arms.
“We’re planting seeds,” Stephenson said. 


Faith is graduating this year. She 
plans to move to Georgia to live with 
her older brother and pursue her nursing 
degree, as well as her own clothing line. 
Some day, she hopes to build a homeless 
shelter. For now, Faith is focused on mov­
ing forward. “It ain’t the same, but I can’t 
keep letting these deaths hold me back.”


Faith is excited for a new start. She’ll 
miss her friends and family in New 
Haven—especially the ones she can’t 
take with her. “Most of all, I’ll miss going 
to the grave sites,” she said.


When asked about Riverside, with­
out hesitation, she says, “I’ll be back to 
visit for sure.” ∎


Christina Lee is a junior in 
Davenport College.


“We come as a community and make sure 
that we’re here to help each other out.”


In addition to offering typical 
courses—English, history, and alge­
bra—Riverside gives students the room 
and freedom to pursue their hobbies and 
interests in a way that is low-pressure but 
still structured and guided. Pavano, the 
art teacher, has had students interested 
in carpentry build kitchen cabinets and 
countertops, students interested in auto­
mobile mechanics draw  schematics, and 
students hoping to become hairdressers 
develop new hairstyles. Faith, who wants 
to become a Certified Nursing Assistant, 
prepares for the exam during Pavano’s 
class. “My classroom is, ‘Listen, whatever 
you love, bring it in here. I’ll find a way 
to make it happen for you. I’ll find a way 
to support it,’” he said.


Pavano says that most of his students 
have gone on to lead “great, productive” lives.


Peter Chase has taught history at 
Riverside for five years. On his wall hangs 
military badges, patches, and a portrait 
of him in uniform, where he served as a 
Petty Officer Third Class, with a brood­
ing blue-eyed gaze and a chiseled face. 
Faith remarked that back then he was a 
heartbreaker and now he’s a chair breaker. 
It’s an inside joke the two share. 


But more importantly, Chase is a 
product of alternative education himself. 
He described himself as “a rough kid,” 
joking that he had “so much fun senior 
year” that he did it twice. After five years, 
Chase graduated from a basic studies 
program, similar to Riverside’s alterna­
tive schooling model, in Branford, CT. 
His personal experience with alternative 
education was the reason why he wanted 
to teach at a school like Riverside. 


Coming from a place of under­
standing, Chase connects with his stu­
dents outside of the classroom, too. He 
does cookouts with his students and 
takes them fishing.


For some outside of the school, 
Riverside is one piece of a larger fight to 
protect young people in New Haven. 
Reverend Dr. John E. Cotten, Jr. is 
the senior pastor at New Hope Baptist 
Church, founded in 1958. Dalonna has 
a close relationship with Cotten, refer­
ring to him as “dad.” On December 19th, 
Daily’s celebration of life ceremony took 
place at Cotten’s church.


Passionate about helping the city’s 
youth, Cotten founded Queen Esther, a 
faith-based initiative that recruits foster 
care and adoption parents. He expressed 
his frustrations with the lack of support 
systems for young people, even as they 
share a city with an institution like Yale. 
“I don’t understand why our children 
are not protected,” he said. “We are here 
in a major city, New England, the top 
school in the world, and yet we can’t fig­
ure out how to do this, how to protect 
our young people, or how to educate our 
young people.”


But for Cotten, while Riverside 
might not be the perfect solution to pro­
tecting the most vulnerable students in 
New Haven’s public school system, shut­
ting it down isn’t either. 
“If you shut it down, where are they 
going to go? What’s going to happen to 
the kids?” he asks. “To shut down some­
thing without providing a better alterna­
tive that meets the needs of the reason 
why you are shutting down the first 
institution—that’s confusing to me.”
