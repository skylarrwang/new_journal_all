Intelligence. He says the industry is 
“more forward-thinking” in the U.S. than 
in his home country. Yet the volatility 
of the Trump administration’s policies 
concerns him. “I think it just feels very 
unpredictable on what he is going to do,” 
said Martinsons.

Donald Trump’s first presidency 
included an executive order which led to 
denials of H-1B petitions increasing four­
fold from 6 percent in 2015 to 24 percent 
in 2018. The order also resulted in longer 
delays and requests for evidence, slow­
ing down the application process as a 
whole. In 2017, Trump issued Executive 
Order 13769 to “protect the nation from 
foreign terrorist entry” into the U.S., 
targeting travel from primarily Muslim 
countries. The order sparked concerns 
about the safety of international students 
and scholars studying abroad in America, 
though the department of Homeland 
Security later clarified that the ban 
excluded student visas.  

During the 2024 election, Trump 
showed mixed stances toward legal 
immigrants: In June of 2024, he stated 
that he would provide green cards to 
all foreign students who graduate from 
U.S. colleges. Over the last few months, 
he has been engaged in heated debate 
about the H-1B visa program, at points 
even claiming,“I’ve always liked the 
visas...I have used it many times. It’s a 
great program.” However, many experts 
On January 29th, Trump issued an 
executive order pledging to deport inter­
national students who participated in 
pro-Palestine protests. 

Meanwhile, Project 2025, in which 
many of Trump’s closest advisors and 
administration members are heavily 
involved, includes a section on prioritiz­
ing national security in student programs, 
suggesting that the government “elimi­
nate or significantly reduce the number 
of visas issued to foreign students from 
enemy nations.” 

International students pursuing a 
career in the U.S. are also left wonder­
ing how the presidency will play into 
their futures. If students wish to stay 
post-graduation, they must apply for 
extended time allowed for professional 
experience through Optional Practical 
Training or Curricular Practical Training. 
The other, more long-term option to 
secure a place in U.S. is through visa 
sponsorship from a U.S. company, most 
often the H-1B visa for occupations 
that require “theoretical and practical 
application of a body of highly special­
ized knowledge.” Pursuing an H-1B visa 
usually means securing a job with large 
employers with enough funding to spon­
sor visas. 

Lorenss Martinsons ’26, from Latvia, 
studies Cognitive Science and plans to 
stay in the U.S. to pursue fields related 
to machine learning and Artificial 
expect increased scrutiny in 
the H-1B visa process. 

“He’s sending a lot of 
mixed messages, and the 
main problem is the com­
plete uncertainty on what 
his position will be. I’ve defi­
nitely shifted my priorities to 
be more attentive about how 
the rules might be changing, 
and how that might impact 
my future,” Martinsons said. 

His worry seems to hold 
true even for those who 
aren’t committed to staying 
in America. Two students 
I spoke to mentioned that 
they’d begun searching for 
potential internships and 
careers in Europe. 

Ozan Say, the direc­
tor 
of 
the 
Office 
International Students & 
Scholars, points out that 
despite the general anxiety 
about 
immigration 
laws 
and travel bans amongst 
the international commu­
nity, there are nuances to the changes a 
Trump presidency might impose. He 
assures students that Yale will con­
tinue to support international students 
through any changes, and, as it always 
has, “advocate for reasonable immi­
gration improvements that benefit our 
students,” particularly in situations that 
might impact their safety in the country.

lite U.S. universities like Yale 
became hubs for international stu­
dents during the Cold War. The colleges 
played a role in American soft power 
diplomacy, marketing the nation as a 
global leader in democracy and higher 
education. Since then, U.S. universities 
have often been deemed a path to success. 

Orozco was aware of the socioeco­
nomic privileges that Yale would pro­
vide him when he decided to enroll from 
Colombia. “There is a sense of status that 
comes from being here. Being interna­
tional studying in America, going to an 
Ivy League school—that reads in a certain 
way to people, both to Latin Americans 
back home and to Americans,” he said. 

What he points out is true: being 
an international student studying in the 
States is perceived by many as a mark of 
status and privilege. Being a student at

Yale, in particular, is often seen as a golden 
ticket to living out the successful life 
in America that so many yearn for. In 
his first speech as the 23rd president of 
Yale University, Peter Salovey quoted 
James Truslow Adams, writer and histo­
rian, who coined the phrase “American 
Dream,” when describing what Yale 
offers students: “A land in which life 
should be better and richer and fuller 
for everyone, with opportunity for each 
according to ability or achievement.”

This narrative of America as a land 
of freedom and opportunity seems to 
still ring true for some international stu­
dents coming to the U.S.

When pro-democracy protests swept 
Hong Kong in 2019 during Trump’s 
first presidency, Sam, who has been 
granted anonymity via pseudonym 
due to concerns about Hong Kong’s 
national security law, remembers pro­
testers waving American flags in the 
streets of his hometown. 

“A lot of foreigners still see America 
as a beacon of freedom and democracy. 
The hope for them is that Trump is a 
strong-man kind of character that could 
help people who don’t have the fortune 
to live in a democracy,” Sam said. “But 
then you see that America is becoming 
more and more unstable, and Trump 
inarguably being a big aggregator of 
many problems, which makes me con­
cerned for the future.”

Zhou also senses that what was 
once a system representing “the epitome 
of democracy” is shifting ideologically. 
Post-World War II, the U.S. advertised 
itself as a land of freedom and democra­
cy—a “policing of the world” of sorts, as 
Sam notes. To study in the U.S. as a stu­
dent from Hong Kong means access to 
ideological freedom in a way that echoes 
the myths told about the land of America. 

Donald Trump’s reelection shows 
an obvious fracture in this tale. Trump 
himself has demonstrated frequent 
autocratic tendencies, openly admiring 
political leaders such as Kim Jong Un 
and Vladimir Putin, threatening media 
outlets that outwardly report against him, 
and making threats against political ene­
mies such as Liz Cheney.

Despite such signs, Sam continues 
to have faith in American ideals. “I want 
to stay in America because I believe that 
America would give me great opportu­
nities, and I believe in the system,” Sam 
said. “I like the democracy and the free­
doms that it gives me, even as a non-cit­
izen—theoretically, at least. I think 
America as a country, and the idea of 
America itself, can live on.” 

Others aren’t so optimistic. Orozco 
admits that he holds a very cynical per­
spective on the U.S. as a whole. “I don’t 
feel as if I belong to this country at all,” 
he said. 

Underlying Orozco’s contempt is 
Colombia’s long history under aggressive 
U.S influence and intervention, a notable 
example being Plan Colombia, a U.S.-led

initiative aimed at combating drug traf­
ficking and insurgencies which arguably 
exacerbated violence and displacement.

Orozco is far from the only inter­
national student who harbors a sense of 
alienation from the U.S. Students I spoke 
to are quick to deride America’s political 
polarization and foreign intervention. In 
some way, there is a collective identity on 
campus formed not around being inter­
national, but rather not being American. 

Mustafa ’25, who is identified by 
first name only out of concern for future 
employment opportunities, is originally 
from Iraq but is now an American cit­
izen. He immigrated to the U.S in 2017 
with his family on a special immigration 
visa after the Iraq War. During Trump’s 
first election, he remembers a sense of 
fear and worry in his household as they 
applied for a green card. “There were sto­
ries back home about Trump-era border 
control, and green cards being snapped 
in half. They’re probably not true, but 
there was a general air of anxiety about 
immigration status being canceled out of 
nowhere or put on pause.”

He notes that this time around, the 
second Trump presidency only fur­
thered the distrust he had already felt 
toward the U.S. “I think the general 
sense towards America’s political land­
scape when I go back home is, ‘Get a 
grip.’ This kind of thing happens every­
day in Iraq,” he said. “American prob­
lems are problems, but we’ve dealt with 
so much more. I think the only reason 
for anxiety is because many Americans 
still believe in America as a clean 
institution, and people aren’t rightly 
disillusioned by its politics.”

Orozco’s and Mustafa’s sharp sen­
timents hint that beneath many Yale 
students’ upset reactions towards the 
election—American or not—lies a fad­
ing expectation that the U.S. upholds the 
ideals it advertises. For many interna­
tional students, the reelection of Donald 
Trump only confirms what they’ve long 
realized: that the stories told of the U.S. 
as the land of freedom and democracy 
are distorted and untrue.  

IV.
A
part from all the logistical rea­
sons that his presidency may impact 
their lives, Donald Trump’s election has 
also widened the emotional distance 
many international students feel toward 
the U.S. His second term signals a clear 
message: that we are outsiders, and will 
be branded as such for the next four 
years more than ever before.  

The overwhelming majority of Yale’s 
international community, however, con­
tinues to be highly privileged outsiders 
with powerful legal and institutional 
protection. The Office of International 
Students & Scholars offers logistical 
support and community for interna­
tional students, implementing program­
ming such as first-year orientations and 
bonding events. Simply being part of the 
institution of Yale offers a further layer 
of protection—students told me stories 
of immigration officers glancing at “Yale” 
on their visa and immediately letting 
them through, while their parents tag­
ging along were questioned thoroughly. 

And despite the uncertainty, inter­
national students continue to come to 
Yale for the tangible opportunities it 
provides educationally, professionally, and 
socioeconomically. 

Yale also offers its students some sense 
of belonging. 

The cynicism that I heard in many 
international students, and recognized 
within myself, seems tied to a refusal 
to associate oneself too deeply with the 
U.S. And yet, our lives are so intertwined 
with Yale—a place embodying an epit­
ome of American wealth and status. I 
was curious whether students thought 
themselves to be at home at Yale, a much 
smaller world within the country. 

The general sentiment seemed to 
be yes. “Yale feels utopian sometimes,” 
Zhou said. “I have such a welcoming 
community here, people are very open 
and genuine.” 

“Of course there’s a sense of home,” 
Orozco said. “I think it’s difficult 
to define what being ‘at home’ even 
means—can Americans even ever feel as 
if they fully belong to this country? But 
when it comes to Yale, I have my social 
circle here, I call my dorm ‘home.’ There’s 
always going to be a sense of affinity.” 

I, like many of my international 
peers, remain highly skeptical of the U.S. 
on many levels. The sense of distance 
rooted in the U.S.’ history, how it wields 
its political and economic power, and 
more fundamentally the experience of 
living in a foreign culture will always 
exist. In the same way that one might 
feel most like a Yale student back home, 
I find myself most Japanese when I am 
here, surrounded by those who are not. 

The Trump presidency further com­
plicates this relationship international 
students have with the U.S., what the 
country means to us, and where our 
places might be here. And yet, to posi­
tion ourselves between America and our 
home countries, to exist inside the gates 
of Yale, also means we have tied our lives 
inextricably to this country.
