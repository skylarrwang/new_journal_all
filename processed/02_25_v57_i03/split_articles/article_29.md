Since 2019, forty-four pedestrians and cyclists have been killed on 
New Haven streets. Six years later, activists say nothing has changed.


They say the streets have become the 
“Wild West.” That their chests seize with dread 
as they step on the asphalt. That cycling feels 
like a “full contact sport,” but it’s their fault if they 
get hit. That the two of them just wanted to get an 
ice cream cone, and now their friend will never eat 
one again; that it’s traffic violence, not mere acci­
dents; that everyone is afraid and too many have 
died and reassurances aren’t enough anymore. That 
they were promised change. 
Since 2019, forty-four pedestrians and cyclists 
have been killed on New Haven streets. The city 
consistently has the highest rate of pedestrian 
crashes in all of Connecticut. There’s an unspoken 
rule among cyclists and pedestrians: wait at least 
three seconds before you cross the road. Red light 
runners won’t wait for you to look both ways. In 
2021, 305 Connecticut residents submitted written 
testimonies in support of a state-wide omnibus 
traffic safety bill; over half were from New Haven. 
One of them, Carmen Viudes, was almost run over 
the morning she planned to write her letter. In her 
testimony, she described the incident succinctly: 
“He was protected by a one-ton metal cage, while I 
am a soft bag of flesh and bone.”
Of the dozen cyclists, pedestrians, and activists 
I spoke to, nearly everyone knew someone killed in 
a car crash, and all had their own close calls. The 
first reaction to a traffic-related death is usually 
to blame the people involved: brake-averse driv­
ers, reckless cyclists, distracted pedestrians. But in 
the wake of several high-profile deaths in 2008, a 
growing number of New Haveners began noticing 
that crashes were concentrated in hotspots across 
the city, such as Ella T Grasso Boulevard, Whalley 
Avenue, and the lower-income neighborhoods of 
Fair Haven, Dixwell, and The Hill. There must be 
systemic reasons. 
Since its emergence in 2008, the Safe Streets 
Coalition has refocused conversations surround­
ing traffic safety toward New Haven’s enduring 
infrastructural issues: faded or wholly absent cross­
walks, ill-timed pedestrian signals, wide lanes that 
encourage speeding, and inconsistent bike lanes. 
Bringing together residents and experts, the coa­
lition has applied pressure to key projects and 
collaborated with the city to develop actionable 
roadmaps for change. 
But the fatalities are unceasing. New Haven 
must radically rethink its street designs, activists 
say, and stop treating traffic violence as inevitable. 
In its way, however, stands a city bureaucracy rid­
dled with inefficiencies.


II. Co-Op and Coalition
Doug Hausladen’s life of public service was 
foreshadowed. When he was four, in the blue­
grass rolling hills of Kentucky, Hausladen went 
door-knocking with his mother to gather signatures 
for a sidewalk installation. After a brief stint as the 
Ward 7 Alder of New Haven, he would direct the 
city transportation department from 2014 to 2021. 
Affectionately dubbed by fellow public servants as 
“Downtown Doug,” his commitment to progressive 
transportation infrastructure landed him a spot in 
Connecticut’s 40 under 40 in 2022.
Two deaths galvanized his advocacy. In 2008, 
Mila Rainof, a student at the Yale School of 
Medicine, was struck by a car while crossing South 
Frontage Road and York Street, a busy intersection 
in front of the hospital where she worked. Her death 
left the Yale community in disbelief. Hausladen 
couldn’t shake the similarities between himself and 
Rainof. Both were 25, with aspirations to help others; 
she was headed to an emergency medicine residency 
in California, he wanted to one day be an alder; she 
was hit on her two-block commute home, he walked 
two blocks to work every day. It could have easily 
been him, he realized, killed randomly on the streets, 
his life cut short. 
Then, just a month after Rainof ’s death, 
Gabrielle Lee, an 11-year-old girl, was killed in a hit-
and-run while crossing Whalley Street on her way 
to the laundromat. The two deaths jolted the entire 
city: traffic safety was no longer an afterthought but 
the subject of heated discourse. Having first joined
