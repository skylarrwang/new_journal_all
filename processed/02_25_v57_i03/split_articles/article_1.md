Dear readers,
This issue of The New Journal finds you in the aftermath. In the wake of 
tragedy, people are confronted with a choice: to pick up the pieces, or to 
build anew.
In our cover story, Tina Li ’27 follows a group of cyclists, galvanized by the 
deaths of their friends to fight for safer streets. Meanwhile, Christina Lee ’26 
visits the last alternative school in New Haven as it mourns the loss of two 
students. Paola Santos ’25 checks in on the Anti-Corruption Foundation, 
operating leaderless and in exile, a year after the death of its founder, Russian 
opposition leader Alexei Navalny. 
Elsewhere, our writers wrestle with whether a city can learn from its past. A 
victim of police violence looks at the jagged road to police reform. Successive 
failed developments in Westville haunt the city’s efforts toward affordable 
housing. And while Yale claims to uphold free expression, its new policies 
sever protest from campus space. 
We write to you from a new year already wracked by devastation: last month 
wildfires swept through cherished neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and a slew 
of executive orders have destabilized long-standing fixtures of American 
democracy.
We hope these stories can help us to hold what has survived, and find the 
resilience to go forward.
