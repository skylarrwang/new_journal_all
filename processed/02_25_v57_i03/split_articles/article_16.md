Spring with its promise of holidays was 
come on the open farm 
behind the house 
behind your father’s house. 
You knew this: 
you caught on our way 
your father’s asparagus 
sprouted out of earth. 
Inside my fool brother sought your sister. 
You knew this too: 
I had allergies and sneezed 
and you wiped my nose 
and yours from the laughter. 
In the tall grass after 
I asked: if you too stooped to marry, where 
was the field you, you would sow and 
what would you grow there? 
You parted the dirt. Me? Oh, no. Here, see? 
At the harvest he will reap his plenty.
