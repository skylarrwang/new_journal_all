On Cercacelli’s Harrison Hill Farm in Northford, CT, an abandoned asylum, a church, and a graveyard sit alongside empty tomato fields. As we drive through the farm in his truck, William Dellacamera, the owner, points out the shed—decorated as a haunted dollhouse—where his eight-year-old daughter, Callie, spooked local farm-goers this past fall. “I wish I didn’t have to do this,” Dellacamera gestures towards carefully painted haunted houses, an extra source of income for the farm. Eventually, we reach the farm’s perimeter, where damaged wooden posts hold together a dented metal gate.

In August 2024, a hail storm wiped out an entire season’s worth of produce on Dellacamera’s farm in just thirteen minutes. Now, he owes 510,000 dollars in insurance bills and weather damage repairs.

Climate change has increasingly disrupted the lives of Connecticut farmers, resulting in an influx of droughts, flooding, and untimely warm temperatures. In 2023, Connecticut farmers faced over twenty one million dollars in losses due to frosts and flooding.

The absence of government aid for farmers like Dellacamera in response to such climate disasters, on the other hand, is not unprecedented. 

At 19 years old, back in 1999, Dellacamera experienced a drought while working on the Cecarelli farm in Northford. There, he watched Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman use the farm as a stage to proclaim their mission to support small farms, specifically through low-interest loans—a solution small farmers oppose as they struggle to pay them off.

Twenty-six years later, Dellacamera stands in a similar place; this time he has the opportunity to directly voice the needs of small farms like his to Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, who visited Cecarelli farm after the storm.

Not all farmers could keep fighting, though. Unlike the United States’ largest farming states, in which large single-crop farms dominate, Connecticut farms skew small. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 460 out of 5,058 Connecticut farms closed between 2017 and 2022. These small farmers are trapped within a system that does not adjust to their size. Many face mountains of debt, have trouble navigating the insurance system, and remain overlooked on the policy floor. This, amidst the natural disasters exacerbated by climate change—such as the hail storm at Cecarelli’s—buries farmers deeper in economic strife.


Before the green Revolution in the 1960s, when scientific advancements aimed to increased crop production, farms thrived off variety, supporting themselves and people’s diets with a regional variety of crops. “Pretty much everyone was a diversified farmer,” describes Ella Kennen of the New Connecticut Farmer Alliance. “And then these policies came into place that subsidized a handful of crops, and that
