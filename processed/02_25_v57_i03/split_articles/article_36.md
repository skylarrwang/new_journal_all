Breaking Old Ground
green spaces, ample but less visible 
parking, and the creation of three new 
streets, one of which curves through 
the entire complex. The design seems 
promising, cognizant of the site’s for­
mer challenges and thoughtful in how 
it addresses them. While it doesn’t 
include the screen doors and walled-off 
gardens that she and her fellow resi­
dents lobbied for, Yarbrough agreed it 
was an improvement. 

When Yarbrough and I spoke, we 
sat in the living room of her new home 
in Rockview where photos of her sons 
and grandsons line the walls and her 
favorite color, bright red, fills the 
space. Yarbrough immediately made 
me feel welcome, ushering me inside 
from the cold even though my shoes 
were covered with snow. She was one 
of the residents on the north side of 
the Manor who the housing author­
ity relocated in preparation for phase 
one of demolition and construction 
in 2019. Six years later, there is still no 
progress on the development. 

The 
pandemic 
arrived 
before 
phase one broke ground, beginning 
a period of inaction that continues 
today. Getting federal subsidies for 
constructing and renovating afford­
able housing is extremely competitive, 
and the housing authority’s bids have 
thus far been unsuccessful. Draughn 
seems optimistic that they will secure 
the money soon, but it only covers 
phase one of the project. Relief for 
residents is many years away.

I 
approached a woman, who requested 
to use the pseudonym Maria to pro­
tect her identity, one frigid January 
afternoon as she scrubbed the exterior 
of her white SUV. Maria said she had 
been relocated by the housing authority 
to the Manor only a couple of months 
ago. The public housing project which 
she had long called home, West Hills, is 
currently undergoing its delayed rede­
velopment. She had no sense of when 
demolition at the Manor would begin, 
when she would again be forced to pack 
up and move. I asked how she liked liv­
ing in Westville Manor, and she told me 
“it’s no different from any other neigh­
borhood, it has its problems, it has its 
shootings, it needs work done.” 

In our conversation, Draughn talked 
extensively about the stigma surround­
ing public housing. The fact that the 
Hamden fence came down only about 
ten years ago “speaks to this shared bias 
that continues around what we think 
about the families who live in affordable 
housing.” At the same time, a two bed­
room unit in New Haven costs close to 
two thousand and four hundred dollars 
per month, 35 percent higher than the 
national average. “Entry level teach­
ers, entry level police officers, they can’t 
afford to pay that,” Draughn explained. 

When a project undergoes redevel­
opment, the housing authority gives the 
displaced residents the choice between a 
unit in another one of their properties or 
a voucher to buy a home. Each resident 
also has the option to move back once 
construction is complete. While she 
has some fond memories of Westville 
Manor, Yarbrough is settled and content 
in Rockview. “I wouldn’t go back,” she 
told me. ∎
