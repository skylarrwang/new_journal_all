hen uzziah shell, 16, and 
Daily Jackson, 17, were shot and 
killed in late 2024, the students 
and faculty of Riverside Educational 
Academy took a step back from their 
typical class schedules. Mel Campbell, 
a math teacher at Riverside, described 
a “dark cloud” looming over the school. 
“Everybody was grieving,” he explained. 
“Going through different stages of grief at 
the same time.” 
Male students whom he never 
would have expected to show vulnera­
bility cried. Some students were angry. 
Some broke down. Others reminisced 
about the good times they shared with 
the late students, created posters, and 
wore 
memorial 
hoodies. 
Everyone 
needed support. 

The deaths occurred only eleven 
days apart. On the Friday afternoon of 
November 22nd, Uzziah Shell was shot 
and killed near Goffe Street and Hudson 
Street. On December 3rd, just four days 
before Uzziah’s funeral, Daily was shot 
and killed on Shelton Avenue. Both 
Uzziah and Daily were friends and stu­
dents at Riverside Academy. The deaths, 
according to New Haven Chief of Police 
Karl Jacobson, were linked in association 
to feuds between youth groups. 
“It was like the wound was starting 
to heal, scab over, and started going 
back to the little bit of normal as we 
could. And then it was ripped off,” 
Campbell said.
Located 
along 
Long 
Wharf, 
Riverside Academy is the last standing 
alternative high school in New Haven, 
with a student body of less than two 
hundred. It is commonly known as 
New Haven’s school for at-risk students. 
Since its founding around twenty-five 
years ago, the school has aimed to pro­
vide an alternative path to completing 
high school for students who struggle in 
a traditional classroom setting. Its goal 
is to support students during their final 
developmental years, especially when 
they’re facing familial challenges and 
housing and food insecurity. 

Ronald Huggins, Deputy Director 
of Youth Services, New Haven’s’ Youth 
and Recreation Department, explained 
that matriculating to Riverside is a mat­
ter of students having “courageous con­
versations” to confront their risk of not 
graduating or getting their high school 
diploma.
New Haven public schools refer 
students to Riverside when students 
struggle to maintain their attendance 
or meet credit requirements. In most 
cases, school referrals are made by assis­
tant principals, who identify students 
in need of more focused attention and 
personalized instruction that cannot be 
provided in densely populated schools. 
Riverside Principal Derek Stephenson, 
Sr. performs thorough evaluations of 
whether or not a student’s needs can 
be met through matriculation. Schools 
sending students to Riverside provide 
a profile of a potential student, which 
details their academic, attendance, and 
disciplinary histories. When a referral 
reaches Stephenson’s desk, he reviews 
the application packets and meets with 
prospective students and their fami­
lies. A smaller portion of students come 
through as self-referrals.
The school itself is a plain, stark- 
white 
brick, 
single-story 
building. 
Standing just off the road, it is not 
fenced in. There is little identification 
other than “Riverside Academy,” writ­
ten in blue —once above the entrance 
doors, and a second time on the side of 
the building.
A security officer stands posted by 
the entrance to the lobby, where light 
spills in from an octagonal skylight. Past 
the metal detector, common to all of 
New Haven’s public schools, sitsis a small 
water fountain. An illustration of the 
Riverside Raptors, the school mascot, is 
printed on the wall above the fountain. 
Riverside wasn’t always the only 
alternative high school in New Haven. 
In 2018, the New Haven Board of 
Education voted to shut down the 
alternative high schools New Light 
High School and New Horizons High 
School due to budget cuts. Following 
the closures, the two schools consoli­
dated with Riverside, the largest alter­
native school at the time. Seeking more 
affordable rent, the Board of Education 
moved Riverside from its original loca­
tion at 560 Ella T. Grasso Blvd. to 103 
Hallock Avenue.
Narrowly spared from budget cuts 
and now rocked by tragedy, Riverside 
has faced criticism and calls for it to shut 
down. Though some argue that the very 
system of alternative schooling harms 
students, Riverside continues to defend 
its model, arguing that it fills a critical 
niche in the school system for students 
who need more specialized attention. 
Now the smallest in the city’s school sys­
tem, Riverside promises unmatched care 
and attention to student engagement.
There is no instruction manual for a 
grieving school. The students, staff, and 
teachers at Riverside have turned to 
each other for guidance. Amidst debates 
over whether alternative education can 
properly serve its students, Riverside 
promises to try.

O  
n the evening of December 
3rd, Dalonna Jackson was walking 
into her house after work when 
the emergency lights of an ambulance 
flew past her. Six minutes after stepping 
into her home, Dalonna’s aunt yelled out, 
“Buster got shot!” When Dalonna arrived 
at the scene, Daily—known affectionately 
as “Buster” by friends and family—was 
being transported to the hospital. By the 
time Dalonna arrived, it was too late. 
Daily was walking home along 
Shelton Avenue when he was killed in a 
drive-by just a few blocks away from home. 
Over a month after the killing, at 
a press conference at the New Haven 
Police Department that Wednesday 
afternoon, Assistant Chief of Police 
David Zannelli announced that Daily’s 
alleged killer, a 17-year-old juvenile 
defendant, was taken into custody and 
arrested. Family members and friends in 
attendance sobbed as Zannelli recalled 
the details of the crime scene. 
Dalonna 
was 
the 
penultimate 
speaker at the press conference. She 
spoke with a calm and languid counte­
nance, her hands clasped by her chest 
and shoulders swinging from side to 
side. She wore a sweatshirt, gifted by 
her godparents, printed with pictures of 
Daily and accessorized by pins reading, 
“Forever in our hearts. We will always 
remember you.” For Dalonna, the famil­
iarity of the podium was especially pain­
ful. Sixteen years ago, her father was shot 
and killed when she was only 8 years old 
and Daily was 1 year old. Now, 24 four 
years old, she carried the weight of two 
losses. Standing before city officials, 
news reporters, and family members,
