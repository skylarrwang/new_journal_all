way of making sense of the incomprehensible luck of Holocaust survival.
These fine gradations of my great-grandmother’s testimony are something only I, or another member of my family, can understand. The thought of an academic coming across her story in the archive troubles me. It isn’t that I am worried they won’t understand her or the complexities of her narrative, although they will never grasp my, or my mother’s knowledge of her. It is that I am not willing to share my great grandmother. Now that she is no longer alive, this testimony feels like the most valuable piece of her that I have left. The crumbling house in Queens has been demolished, and the chicken soup doesn’t shine gold the same way. Her story will always belong to me, but since 1989, it has also, in effect, belonged to Yale. 
Each survivor that records for Fortunoff signs a legal document. The current version, shared by Naron, says that survivors grant Yale and the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies unrestricted rights to use their image and likeness, as well as distribute it on other platforms. However, I understand that my great grandparents did not fully sign their stories away—they remain our own. Every logical part of me trusts Fortunoff’s leaders: “We feel an enormous obligation to the survivors who shared their testimonies with us,” Naron said. “From the start, we created a number of policies to protect survivors from potential harm.” He noted that survivors can add or remove components to the standard release if they desire an embargo on the testimony, or want to restrict its use in a certain way. “Most survivors are happy to sign free of restrictions. After all, they gave testimony because they want it to be used and shared,” he explained. “A small minority are more protective, and that’s their right, and we abide by their restrictions in perpetuity.” 
I also understand that these stories do no good sitting in a dark corner of Sterling Memorial Library. Testimony, when treated with the care it merits, is the gold standard of Holocaust representation, and can be an extraordinary method for education.
Nahanni Rous worked with Fortunoff to co-produce the podcast “Those Who Were There: Voices From the Holocaust,” which uses the archive’s testimonies. In the third season, Rous reconstructs the city of Vilna before, during, and after the war. “In that series, there’s a little bit more of a sense of trying to reconstruct events that played out,” she told me, “in that series I actually really was looking for different and sometimes conflicting perspectives on the same event.”
The class I took in my first semester, “Representing the Holocaust,” is taught by Millicent Marcus and Maurice Samuels. They assigned the final for the class carefully—students were asked to choose a testimony to engage with in essay form. “We don’t want people to criticize the testimony, but to come at it as a scholar of testimony and to look at it as a form of representation,” Samuels said. Both professors expressed their satisfaction with how students grappled with the testimonies. The goal of the final was to not only listen with care, but to negotiate the dynamics of testimony as a format; to interrogate how and why certain questions were asked, and how survivors responded in speech, body language, and mannerism. “I would love to see everyone at Yale engage in the archive in some way,” Samuels added. 
Fortunoff’s ways of working with testimony are getting more creative, Rous’s podcast being one example. The reach of these stories may go much farther in an untraditional format—most people do not have the interest, let alone the patience, to sit down and watch a multi-hour recording. But as these testimonies are adapted, we may lose some of their original magic, of whatever powerful, hours-long release figures like Laub were able to initiate.

**The Bees**
**Author: Andrew Storino**

Having so long watched others
set to work before me, 
I enter now the suit of heavy cotton 
and slip my hands into goatskin gloves, 
those sly parodies of nature.
 The galea lowers its darkness over me 
dimming the world, 
coaxing me to safety. 
I check myself: 
the quality of my disguise 
the state of things in their right place, 
and at last lean down among them. 
Their sound comes up,
thousand-fold and loud, 
like the cars that passed close by 
when I walked along 
the highways as a child. 
And immediately
sickly, small, and orange, 
I overwinter with them there 
until the great smoke pours down 
like air through bared teeth.
