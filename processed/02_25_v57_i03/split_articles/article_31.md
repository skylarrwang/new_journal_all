they originally circulated among each other. Addae 
dreams of a day when basic traffic safety is ensured 
and she can push for radical and experimental 
street plans. Trestman sees the flourishing state of 
some cities across the world and remains hopeful 
that the tenets of active transportation are indeed 
simple and attainable. 

New Haven has good bones to work with, 
Hausladen believes. It has a gridded and geometri­
cally straightforward system of short, narrow streets 
and over three hundred miles of sidewalk. The city is, 
in many ways, ideal for comprehensive street change. 
Now serving as director of the Parking Authority, 
Hausladen advocates and testifies for proposed traf­
fic safety improvements—recently, red light cameras, 
which were finally allowed last year after the “Vision 
Zero” bill was passed. 

In the meantime, the Complete Streets and Safe 
Routes for All manuals, political victories of decades 
past, collect dust. The black box remains impenetrable. 
In November 2020, the Safe Streets Coalition 
memorialized Lim’s death on South Frontage and 
York with a ghost bike. The activists had picked up 
a junk bike from the bike co-op, carefully coated it 
with durable bone-white paint, and chained it to a 
street pole—then repeated that for the other dozen 
deaths just in that year. Small and somber, it stood 
firm in its reminder; drivers couldn’t miss its stark 
whiteness even if they sped through the intersection.
The bike was stolen or taken down sometime 
a few months later. Before that, though, it stood 
upright, as if Lim could jump back on at any moment 
and ride home.∎
