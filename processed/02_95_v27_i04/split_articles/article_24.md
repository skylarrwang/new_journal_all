the unintended loss of at least I 0 percent 
of normal body weight, leaves the majority 
of AIDS patients in their final months 
looking like concentration camp prisoners. 
So prevalent is the condition, and so 
devastating its effects, that Africans call 
AIDS "slim." To this day, effective 
treatment eludes physicians, who try their 
best to stimulate appetite with Marino!, a 
marijuana derivative .. used for a similar 
condition in cancer patients. 


Like wasting syndrome, AIDS-related 
dementia mysteriously eats away at the 
patient, but it targets the mind. This 
condition, 
some 
physicians 
have 
postulated, may affect every AIDS patient 
in one form or another. Families, friends, 
nurses, and doctors watch as those affiicted 
steadily lose their awareness of reality. A 
former manager of a large company in 
Connecticut who eventuaJiy came to the 
Ho~pice Cottage showed no signs of 
infec_tion umil his lover noticed a number 
of errors in his checking account. Within a 
month he was hospitalized; three months 
later he had no idea who he was. With no 
short-term 
memory, 
he 
talked I 
nonsensically every day about going to 
work. 


Yale's Dr. Selwyn put the patient on 
AZT, which restored normal walking and 
talking abilities within six weeks. Friends 
and family felt increasing excitement with 
each sign of improvement. The patient 
even went home witli his parents for a 
weekend. But then, as the drug always 
does, AZT lost its effectiveness. The 
cancerous lesions of KS appeared on the 
patient's legs, and he once again displayed 
compulsive behavior. He constantly asked 
for a cigarette. Volunteers and nurses 
obliged him, but moments later, on the 
way back from his outdoor smoke, he 
inquired once more, "Can I have a 
cigarette?" 


"It was so sad to watch this guy 
groping for answers and trying to maintain 
his personality and maintain his 
independence 
and 
just 
maintain 
conversations," commented Vinci, the 
Hospice Cottage nurse. "It's heartbreaking, 
Tm


absolutely heartbreaking." Every day 
Hospice workers, along with the patient's 
family and his lover, tried desperately to 
reorient him. On visits to his room, they 
would ask, "What did you do today?" 
Every time he would respond, "Well, I 
went to work." They would counter, "No, 
you didn't; look around, where arc you?" 
His answer: "Oh, I'm not at work." Every 
day they would remind him of the time, 
the date, the place, the situation. "We were 
praying he had an organism, some kind of 
bacteria, because at least then it would be 
treatable," said Vinci. "We sent him to Yale 
for CAT scans and MRis. We were hoping 
there was somcthing-toxo, anything-
that would be treatable with IV. Nothing. 
Everything came back negative. It's all 
dementia." 


N
ot long ago, Vinci would not even 
have expressed such a hope. Only 
within the past five years has the 
medical response to AIDS become largely 
technical. All throughout the 1980s, 
doctors watched as dozens of unknown 
and unrrcatable infections ravaged their 
patients. Physicians played a part they had 
nor since the days before antibiotics: that 
of the family doctor who, much of the 
time, could only hold the hands of those 
suffering. 


When the Centers for Disease Control 
first described a new and devastating 
disease in young homosexual men in June 
1981, it sent a wave of terror through the 
medical communiry. "It was different from 
anything else I had ever seen," recalled Or. 
Friedland, "and it was bad." Later that 
summer, Or. Friedland noticed a similar 
condition in New York Ciry, but this time 
in IV drug users. As all epidemics do, 
AIDS initially called attention to itself in 
those ncar the end of its infection, those 
about to die. While dozens, and then 
hundreds, started dying, the medical 
community watched in disbelief. â€¢For a 
while we had the delusion that we had 
eradicated infectiow diseases," recaHed Or. 
Friedland, "so it's been very humbling." 


AIDS, 
then 
called 
gay-related 
immunodeficiency syndrome, 
stood alone in the pathological 
world for a number of reasons. Its 
related infections knew no limits, 
requiring the attention of every 
medical subspecialty. 


In 
addition, by targeting 
those in their twenties, 
thirties, and forties, it 
caused 
what 
Dr. 
Friedland has dubbed 
an inversion of the life 
cycle. 
Previous- ly, 
widespread mortal-ity 
had 
struck 
that 
population only du-
ring wartime. For 
young doctors and 
nurses, it meant escor-ting their contem-
poraries-not just the very young or the 
very old-to a gruesome end. 


In 1983, researchers discovered HIV, 
the virus almost universally considered 
responsible for rhe modern-day plague. For 
the next few years, fear of transmission 
loomed large in the minds of those caring 
for AIDS patients. Many health care 
workers felt the touch of death with each 
accidental needle prick. AZT appeared in 
1987, and with it came a period of hope. 
AIDS patients enjoyed increased survival, 
fewer opportunistic infections, and 
consequently a better quality of life. Yet 
within two years both providers and 
recipitnts of medical care realized that 
AZT could not hold HIV at bay forever. A 
feeling of despair replaced the short-lived 
excitement over the drug. Since then, 
hospitals have focused on improving the 
response to AIDS-related infections. 


When the epidemic first appeared, the 
prognosis for AIDS patients looked 
despairingly bleak. After a few months and 
one or two opportunistic infections, most 
were dead. As recently as the early 1990s, 
PCP struck over two-thi rds of AI DS 
patients, 20 percent of them dying during 
its first attack. Today, drug combination 
therapy can prevent and treat not only 
PCP, bur TB, 
roxo, cryprococcal 
meningitis, 
and dozens of other 


comp 
ns as 


Nowadays, patients 
diagnosed with AIDS 
live years, not 
months, and mostly 
at home, not in the 
hospital. 


Patients diagnosed 
with AIDS live years, not months, and 
mostly at home, not in the hospital. For 
those individuals who learn of their HIV 
early on and receive prompt medical 
attention, prophylaxis-a series of 
preventive 
measures-provides 
vaccinations for PCP and the flu. Doctors 
check for TB and hepatitis and prescribe a 
number of drugs to combat them. Other 
members of the health care team look into 
fa m ily and other suppor t systems, 
including proper insurance. 


Considering t he incidence of the 
epidemic in New H aven, Yale and irs 
affiliated hospitals joined the attack on 
AIDS relatively late. Unril recently, Yale-
New Haven Hospital offered only a once-
a-week clinic, staffed on a volunteer basis 
by a handful of university physicians. After 
opening the Nathan Smith C linic fo r 
outpatient consultations in I 989, Yale set 
about creating a comprehensive AIDS 
program in I 991. Doctors Friedland and 
Selwyn came from New York to direct the 
effort. 


Over the past four years, Yale's AIDS 
Program has grown considerably. So has 
the epidemic. Clinics remain over-
subscribed. and hospital wards have no 
vacancies. Last year, Nathan Smith 
physicians cared for almost I ,000 adults 
with H IV /AIDS. The inpatient Atkins 
Firm ad mitted over 900. The AIDS


Program also runs a separate cenrer for 
pediarric AIDS, as well as rhe HIY in 
Prisons Program. Ir interfaces directly with 
rhe surrounding city through the Mayor's 
Task Force on AIDS as well as through a 
health care van that follows New Haven's 
needle exchange vehicle twice a week. 


In the hospital, AIDS patienrs fill an 
entire wing of rhe ninth floor, so me 
spilling over into other wards. These are 
rhe patients who, for one reason or 
another, require close monitoring. Some 
will return ro their families in a few days. 
Others will go back to jail. Many will not 
leave rhe hospital alive. Friday mornings, 
the AIDS team gathers at nursing station 
9-5 and begins individual room visits, a 
process known as megarounds. Unlike 
most medical reams, usually a few nurses 
and physicians, the mammoth AIDS team 
often includes over a dozen people. Three 
weeks ago, Dr. Selwyn, attending physician 
for the month, led a crowd of four interns, 
two residents, a clinical nurse specialist, 
other nurses, an infectious diseases fellow, a 
rester, a nutritionist, a counselor, and a 
social worker. "It's a way of bringing a 
whole interdisciplinary approach to patienr 
care," explained Dr. Rick Altice, a 
physician in the AIDS Program and Co-
chief of the Atkins Firm. "It's importanr to 
recognize all of the disease's implications, 
nor just whether the person gets this dose 
of incravenous medication or that dose. It's 
really about how their psychosocial 
development is going, how their substance 
abuse treatment is going along, what are 
the sorts of entitlements and resources the 
person needs. You can't plan rational 
rreatment without the concept of the 
whole patient." 


In the late 80s and early 90s, around 
the rime AZT's faults appeared, rhe 
medical community realized that AIDS 
meant much more than a low T cell count. 
The disease primarily involved gay men 
and IV drug users, the latter being 
primarily poor people of color. "Who 
could be more marginalized in this 
society?" Dr. Friedland wondered at the 
rime. In cities like New Haven, where IV 
drug use accounrs for rhe majority of HIV 
infections, AIDS patients come from 
populations that chronically slip through 
the cracks in the health care system. 


Physicians and counselors worked through 
methadone programs and other substance 
abuse outlets to reach AIDS patients who, 
because rhey lacked either money or 
inclination, rarely sought health care. They 
soon discovered rhar t reating AI DS 
patients often meant addressing an 
addiction rhar might kill before AIDS 
complications did. 


They also discovered, paradoxically, 
rhar news of H IV infection can inspire 
dramatic lifestyle improvements that can 
make up for rhe plummeting CD4 count. 
One woman, incarcerated fo r drug 
involvement, rested positive for HIV. 
When her boyfriend died from AIDS 
complications, she began reading 
extensively about rhe disease and offering 
support to fellow inmates. After quitting 


drugs and moving ro a halfway house, she 
came to Nathan Smith for a follow-up with 
Dr. Frankel, who had been seeing her at 
rhe 
women's 
prison 
in 
Niantic, 
Connecticut. At this first visit, the woman 
showed Dr. Frankel what she feared was 
the onset of AIDS: a rash on her hands. 
After examining the patient, Dr. Frankel 
asked her if she had been doing 
housework. "Why, yes. I've been washing 
dishes," the woman replied, a smile 
growing on her face. ''I'm living life for the 
first rime." 


Dr. Frankel's experience stands as one 
of many in which AIDS patient care 
implies more than medical treatment. "The 
idea is ro care, not just cure," remarked Dr. 
Friedland. "Our goal is to provide longer 
life and enhanced quality of life." Doctors 
and patients alike know that, even with 
vastly improved treatment techniques, 
HIV/AIDS runs its course in a matter of 
years. Helping the patient make the most 
of that time has assumed primacy in many 
health care workers' minds, whether that 
means minimizing pain, being a friend, or 
looking out for a patient's basic rights. 


On the second leg of megarounds three 
weeks ago, the thirteen-person AIDS team 
entered the ninth-floor room of a patient 
slated to return ro prison in three days. 
The man lay on his side looking through 
the window at a mist-covered Harkness 
Tower in the distance. Like many other 
patients seen that morning, he had tattoos, 
on his arms, chest, and back. Like some 
other patients seen that morning, he passed 
his days under rhe ware~ of an officer from 
Connecticut 
Department 
of 
Corrections, who sat silently in the corner 
and read a local tabloid. Bur, like no other 
patient seen rhar morning, the man had a 
set of hand-cuffs around his ankles, tying 
him ro rhe bed. Apparently rhe patient, 
who had a history of refusing medication, 
had agitated his corrections officer the 
previous afternoon by walking into the 
hallv.:ay unattended. As the small crowd 
gathered around his bed, the man, in his 
mid-fifties, rolled over and sat up. "I don't 
want to be tied down like a dog," he 
yelled. "This is policy? You cut a man 
open, give him medication, then send him 
to bed with shackles? What is this?" For 
more than ten seconds no one spoke, a 
syndicated "Murder, She Wrote" episode 
the only sound in rhe room. Then Dr. 
Selwyn stepped forward from behind a 
cluster of white-coated interns. "We agree 
with you, and we'll see what we can do." 


Out in the hallway, Dr. Selwyn asked a 
social worker to contact the necessary 
authorities and reverse the decision. Less 
than five minutes later, the corrections 
officer unbound the patient. 


I
n spite of rhe improbability of 
contracting HIV, a number of health 
care workers still avoid infected 
patients, particularly those they consider 
beyond the reach of effective rrearment. 
The more invasive the procedure, the 
greater the risk and the greater the fear. It 
took Dr. Frankel repeated efforts to 
convince a Yale neurosurgeon to do a brain 
biopsy on one of her patients. "Why 
should I do a risky procedure on someone 
who has such a short lifespan anyway?" he. 
asked her. The surgeon had read the 
patient's chart, and he had reasonably
