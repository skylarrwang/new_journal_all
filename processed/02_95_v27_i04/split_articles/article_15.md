EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
for the next five minutes I'm desperately 
trying to keep stride with a man at least six 
inches shorter than me. "The van is parked 
across the street," he shouts over his 
shoulder, referring to the "Community 
Health Van" in which we plan to spend the 
afternoon. 


The van is one of the many projects 
initiated by Dr. Altice in his quest to 
improve medical services for New Haven's 
most disadvantaged-people whom in Dr. 
Altice's words, "the system is not equipped 
nor willing to take care of." Actually a 
moderately sized RV with a door that 
sticks, the "van" follows New Haven's 
needle exchange van around the city two 
days a week. It parks near the "shooting 
galleries" and offers any takers free medical 
care, HIV testing and counseling, and 
social work services. They do a roaring 
business in condoms. The driver, a 
volunteer named Drew Cacuzza, points out 
that you can tell someone is going to ask 
for condoms when they approach with a 
sheepish smile. 


Embarrassment is not the only emotion 
elicited by the van's presence. Two or three 
times in a given day the medical staff will 
test someone for HIV. For people without 
the 
luxury 
of 
regular 
doctor's 
appointments, a chance visit to the van 
may mean grisly qiscoveries-discoveries 
which, in my idea of the scheme of things, 
have no place on the sun-splashed streets, 
where people sometimes laugh out loud. 


Rick Altice, thank God, has the 
courage to ignore my scheme. An African-
American woman has entered the van. Her 
fingers are covered with lusterless rings. 
Asked if she's been in prison, she says, "Yes, 
about 20 times." She's also been in the 
hospital six times with pneumonia. Dr. 
Altice ushers her into the back of the van 
where there's a miniature doctor's office. 
"Would you like an apple?" he asks. "Yes," 
she says. ''I'm starved."
