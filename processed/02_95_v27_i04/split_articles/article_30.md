chunk of Pia-Doh in her hand and passed 
a piece of it to the people with whom she 
shook hands and instructed them to do the 
same. After a number of handshakes, 
Rebekah asked the Pia-Doh holders to 
remain standing while the others sat. 
When Rebekah said that what we had just 
done was not shake hands but have sex, 
the groups often laughed. But when 
Rebekah mentioned that the proud 
possessors of the Pia-doh all had STDs, in 
accordance with the statistic that one in 
four college students will contract an STD 
before they graduate, their smiles 
disappeared. I smiled, knowing that the 
pink globules had made them think. 
Michal, another member of my group, 
then detailed the transmission and course 
of HIV and AIDS; I admired her for 
undertaking a difficult task. The 
complexity and horror of AIDS still amaze 
me, and I feared then, as now, that my 
words could never adequately explain the 
disease or its repercussions. Luckily my 
rhetoric could handle STDs. I passed out 
STD symptom cards to the audience; they 
read the symptoms, sheepishly or boldly or 
laughingly, and tried to guess the STD. I 
either affirmed or corrected their guesses 
and then outlined the treatment for it. In 
speaking, I relished the boldness and the 
confidence in my voice, the one that so 
often remained silent in classes or group 
discussions. 


Passing cervical caps, sponges, 
spermicide, and pills' around the room, 
Sabrina discussed birth control. Sensing 
that Sabrina's presentation was the one 
most students, especially women, found 
interesting, I was frustrated that she had 
only five minutes to explain the numerous 
options. 


Rebekah had the coveted responsibility 
of illustrating how to place a condom on a 
woodie to illustrate AIDS and STD 
prevention; then groups of freshpersons 
could follow along with their own woodies 
and condoms. I admired Rebekah's swift 
execution in a demonstration where I 
often felt acutely slow and clumsy. 


After the presentations, we divided the 
freshpersons into four groups and

discussed scenarios. My groups typicaJiy 
pondered the hypothetical, but realistic, 
lives of Stephanie and Jim. The scenario 
went as follows: You see Jim hitting on 
Stephanie at Naples on a Thursday night. 
Jim has told you that he tested positive for 
chlamydia two weeks before but has not 
yet begun treatment for the disease. Jim 
often brags that he prefers not to use 
condoms during intercourse and that he 
can convince any woman that he does not 
need to wear a condom. From the way 
I watched myself 
become emboldened 
as I handed out 
condoms, dental 
dams, and abstinence 
cards wrapped in pink 
Valentine's Day 
wishes at Yale 
Station. 
things are going between Jim and 
Stephanie, you suspect that the two of 
them will have unprotected intercourse on 
this night. Jim has just taken a trip to the 
bathroom and Stephanie is alone. Should-
you approach Stephanie and warn her of 
the danger of contracting chlamydia? 


Some students were disgusted with 
Jim, but others understood his dislike of 
condoms. Some students thought 
Stephanie should be informed, but others 
saw such disclosure as a breach of 
confidentiality. I clearly knew that I would 
tell Stephanie, despite other Educators' 
objections that Jim's reputation would 
suffer and that Stephanie should know 
how to care for herself. 


I simply knew that if I were Stephanie, 
I would want to be informed, and 
therefore I would tell her. But I never 
voiced my opinion during discussions-
Educators swiftly learn not to judge or to 
allow their personal opinions to influence 
their presentations. So I simply asked 
questions and allowed students to respond, 
hoping that they would eventually come to 
an informed decision. 


When asked, "What if this scenario 
stated that Jim had AIDS?" students often 
hesitated-! had changed curable 
chlamydia into a fatal disease. Some altered 
their previous answers and others did not; 
I certainly didn't. Although I exasperatedly 
wished I could change the views of Jim's 
supporters, I reassured myself with the 
knowledge that they were at least thinking 
about being the observer, or Stephanie, or 
Jim before they saw the scenario actualized 
in the smoky, pitcher-laden Naples they 
frequented on Thursday nights. 


We ended the presentations with our 
Condom Cards. On pieces of paper we had 
written the steps involved in an evening of 
romance and intercourse. Each freshperson 
took a sign ranging from "A Candlelight 
Dinner" to "Withdrawal of Penis While 
Holding the Base of the Condom" and 
arranged themselves in chronological order. 
Certain steps were fixed-the condom 
always had to be put on before intercourse. 
But other steps were flexible-dinner and 
sleep could take place before or after 
intercourse, as the freshpersons discovered 
gleefully. We were relieved ro find that 
during most of our six presentations, the 
freshpersons arranged an evening of safer 
sex. I just hope they practice it, I thought. 
Bur I was fairly confident they would. 


Spurred by a desire to pursue other 
extracurricular interests and disillusioned 
by the lack of cohesiveness I sensed among 
the Educators, I opted to leave the Student 
AIDS Educators in the spring of my junior 
year. But I feel, with a satisfying twist on 
the old DragTut watchword, that we helped 
protect and inform. I just hope that 
somewhere Mr. Alford is watching me in 
my floral finery and smiling. I know that 
Jeff is.
