EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
ledged and consequently untreated. Dr. 
Miles Cohen, a Toronto psychiatrist, refers 
to the psychological toll on the physically 
healthy as a "silent epidemic." There 
remains a need for the institutional 
empowerment of HIV-negative men that 
will provide support, recognition of their 
emotional distress, and a way of assuaging 
their guilt over their health. Novick is 
beginning to address this need. 

Despite the glaring lack of awareness 
about the problems of the uninfected, it is 
not easy to mobilize help for those who 
remain healthy. The issue threatens to 
fragment the gay community; one gay 
newspaper in San Francisco heralded the 
formation of an HIV-negative support 
group as "viral apartheid." The resources 
of the community response to AIDS are 
already stretched thin. But as Novick 
recognizes, HIV-negative men need to feel 
empowered and legitimized if they are to 
continue to care for the dying. If they 
break down emotionally or become 
alienated, they cannot continue to fight 
the epidemic. More importantly, their 
distress may contribute to its spread. 

Helping the healthy stay negative 
drives Novick's recent work, which focuses 
on increased prevention education. Since 
the development of the test for HIV, he 
explains, "We've neglected the develop-
ment of prevention and care services for 
those who are uninfected. We haven't 
focused on keeping the uninfected alive 
and supported; mentally safe." Those who 
are HIV-negative must maintain an 
awareness of the positive things in their 
lives while constantly coming into contact 
with the reality of the epidemic. "I feel 
more concern now for the uninfected," he 
says. "I used to think of them as whining 
and complaining, what we used to call 'the 
worried well.' But now I recognize that 
they, that we, are burdened-in some ways 
more burdened than those who are ill. I'm 
trying to think about ways to convince 
those who are still healthy that it's worth it 
to put on a condom because it's worth it to 
continue to live." 

Novick would like to see concern for 
the HIV-negative grow. He encourages the 
FEBRUARY 10, 1995 
formation of support groups for the 
uninfected although he does not belong to 
one. He sees the problems of the HIV-
negative as a valid topic for research. In 
the summer of 1993, Novick began to pay 
attention to the emotional background 
behind the second wave of outbreaks of 
HIV infection among younger gay men in 
San Francisco. These young men felt the 
need to identify fully with the gay 
community and at the same time could 
not escape from the emotional aspects of 
its deterioration from disease. They 
practiced unsafe sex, preferring to receive 
the attention and care that came with 
death than to live sad, lonely lives. "The 
gay community is atÂ· risk of losing its 
future as it has already lost its past," says 
Novick. "At least you can reconstruct the 
past, but for these young people to feel 
that infection and death are inevitable 
leaves a sad picture of the future." 

Novick set up a planning committee as 
part of the American Association of 
Physicians for Human Rights to research 
the emotional stress of being HIV-negative 
and how it alters the effectiveness of 
campaigns for safer sex. "It's positive to 
stay negative" has emerged as a slogan 
among those who 
recognize 
the 
psychological state of the HIV-negative. 

Novick has taken on the task of trying 
to fill the void of response to the needs of 
the HIV-negative. He must try to convince 
others that his newest crusade is not one of 
division but of provision for the future. 
"As a community, we need to protect those 
who are ill and dying, but we need to 
make sure that they don't occupy all of our 
space, that we continue to take care of 
those who are alive," he explains. His own 
identity crisis led Novick to validate the 
problems of the HIV-negative. From there 
he followed his usual path to action, to 
insure that those who remain behind can 
stay strong enough to fight, to care, to live 
on, and to form a community. In his 
largest crusade to date, Alvin Novick will 
try to ensure that the HIV-negative gay 
community does not self-destruct.
