arc particularly harsh in their attitudes 
towards homosexuality. Many of these men 
tend to be more closeted, more reluctant to 
come forward for services," says Quoos. 
While statistics show that APNH does not 
primarily serve homosexuals, the increasing 
specialization of the other organizations 
has made the image harder to fight. 


Funding is always a crucial issue for 
non-profit organizations, which must 
vie for inadequate resources. The 
establishment of other AIDS service 
agencies forced APNH to compete for the 
limited money available from both the 
federal 
government 
and 
private 
organizations. "This is a hard community 
to pull money out of, and so now if you 
have too many people going after that 
same pot, it makes it more difficult, makes 
services more fragmented or not funded as 
fully as they should be," says Quoos. Alvin 
Novick, professor of biology at Yale, points 
out that the inadequate pool of available 
funding fractures alliances between 
agencies. •It's like introducing a loaf of 
bread into a compound of prisoners of 
war, • Novick says. "If you toss the loaf of 
bread into the fenced-in yard, there's 
trouble." 


In recent years, cooperation between 
the services has increased. Quoos co-
ordinates a consortium of case managers 
who work to avoid duplication of cases and 
to set consistent standards. The agencies 
have also begun to streamline their 
finances by sharing expenses like auditing. Gonzales asserts that competition for 
funding has not posed a problem for 
Hispanos Unidos in the past. As the 
political climate becomes increasingly 
conservative, Gonzales worries that 
funding will be harder to obtain, making 
competition more severe. The board of 
directors of Hispanos Unidos recently 
discussed the distant possibility of merging 
with APNH and AIDS Interfaith Network 
under a single umbrella organization. The 
agencies would maintain their specialized 
programs and continue to target particular 
populations, but would share office space, 
resources, and administrative costs. 


Cofield rejects the idea of centralized 
case management. 'Til never be in favor of 
that, because we live in different areas and 
so do our people. That's why it's not going 
to work, because my people are not going 
to go into other areas. That's been proven 
already." New Haven's distinct neigh-
borhoods, many of which demarcate class 
and ethnicity, lead to a desire to remain in 
the familiar areas. "People live and die in 
the same neighborhoods," says Cofield. 


The poor public transportation system in 
New Haven also requires scattered AIDS 
service agencies. 


The economic and political status of 
the country as a whole will determine the 
survival of AIDS service agencies in New 
Haven. The future of funding for 
organizations serving people with AIDS 
looks uncertain at best. Money for 
prevention and education comes from 
Connecticut's Health and Addiction 
Services Department, while the case 
managers at all three organizations are paid 
through funds received from the federal 
government's Ryan White Title I Fund, 
established in memory of the boy whose 
story forced the country to confront AIDS 
early in the epidemic. "Ryan White money 
is disaster relief money. The caseloads in 
New Haven and Fairfield counties were so 
outrageously high that we have emergency 
relief money specifically for services," says 
Quoos. The Ryan White Planning Council 
in New Haven assesses the need of each 
agency in the city in order to assist in 
equitable distribution of the money. In 
1996, the money authorized by Ryan 
White Title I will run out. Activists across 
the nation are fighting for its re-
enactment, but the current political 
climate makes this unlikely. 


AIDS service organizations in New 
Haven will survive only if they undertake 
statistical studies to prove their 
effectiveness to the government, says Ed 
Kaplan, professor of management and 
medicine at the School of Management. 
"You have to show you are costing society 
more without the program than with the 
program," he says. "The benefits must 
exceed the cost." In the future, ineffective 
organizations will have to be jettisoned in 
order to channel more money into 
programs that work. 


HIV-positive individuals from already 
marginalized groups tend to evoke less 
sympathy from the American population. 
"Racism is still a very strong and ugly piece 
of the American fabric, and that's clearly at 
work here. We hate poverty, but we punish 
people who are poor," says Quoos. "We 
have a backlash against homosexuals going 
on that's also making this very difficult. 
There's a real hateful, punitive way that 
Americans look at sexuality in general." 


Funding for non-profit agencies is 
inseparable from these social issues. "There 
are political and social decisions involved 
that are not necessarily balanced," he says. 
Novick believes, for example, that a 
perception exists among minority AIDS 
activists that power and funding has been 
grabbed by gay white men, who already 
have access to more resources and funds. 
He counters with studies that show that 
the majority of funding now targets 
minorities. 


New Haven has always been at the 
forefront of AIDS service in cities of its 
size. In the future, the changing national 
political climate and continuing 
demographic shifts in infected populations 
will force the city's agencies once again to 
adapt. "Those who are vulnerable, those 
who are infected, and the vast majority of 
those who provide them services belong to 
groups of people whom we disdained and 
whom we still disrespect," says Novick. "It 
will be either a splendid or humiliating 
example of how our society responds." 


That AIDS often strikes marginalized 
groups offers the country a dramatic 
challenge. 


"This Is a hard 
community to pull 
money out of, and so 
now if you have too 
many people going 
after that same pot, it 
makes it more 
difficult, makes 
services more 
fragmented or not 
funded as fully as 
they should be."
