he children sit in the waiting area with their families. A 
social worker grabs two Auorescent~colored dinosaurs that 
squeal when squeezed to calm siblings chasing each other 
around the clinic. Children build castles of blocks. The 
walls are covered with bright posters. The waiting area is like any 
other pediatrician's office. 


The Pediatric Specialty Clinic at Yale~New Haven Hospital, for 
children born to HIV~positive mothers, looks the same as any other 
pedi~tric specialty clinic; however, no one refers to its true purpose. 
No one speaks about AIDS or HIY. Other clinics in the hospital are 
run simultaneously, so families with AIDS~ i nfected members 
intermingle with those less likely to have an understanding of the 
system in another avenue they would have to give a history again. 
Sometimes it's very scary for them. As supportive as staff may be, it's 
really frightening when their child has to be admitted [to the hospital] 
for the very first time-even if they know it's going to be an 
admission, the child is going to do well, and then go home. It helps if 
someone you have known for a few years comes up and goes through 
that experience with you." 


The clinic focuses on whole families because the disease is readily 
transmitted from mother to child. The clinic supplies and supervises 
services ranging from medical care for the infected child to emotional 
and psychological support for healthy siblings and other family 
members who are coping with terminal illness, caregiving, and death.

pediatrics because the mindset is 
that normally children don't die.

The clinic also matches patients 
with services addressing education, 
prevention, ps ycho~soc ial and 
spiritual issues, and bereavement. 
While every child's story is 
different, AIDS does hit the 
disenfranchised population in large 
numbers, making already difficult 
lives worse. As Dr. Alan Meyers 
and Dr. Michael Weirzman wrote 
in P~diatric HIV Diuau, "The

quality of life and alleviate pain." 
erase board. The atmosphere is tense, especially after a heavy work 
week of emergencies and nine children scheduled for one afternoon. 
Of those nine, six are known to be HIV~positive and three are still too 
young for their statuS to be determined. Even before the first patient 
arrives, the phone begins to ring. Rides to the clinic are arranged for 
those without cars, and food coupons are selected for hospital food 
distribution. Each time a social worker, nurse, or doctor enters the 
conference room after seeing a patient, several people ask, "Are you 
o.k.?" In spite of the stress, people continue to tell jokes and laugh to 
keep themselves moving. to preserve the fragile calm. 


The child's family or caretaker brings the child into the clinic. 
Nurses then weigh each child and place him or her in a room for 
physical and neurological exams. Each nurse and nurse practitioner 
sees the same patients each week to provide a sense of continuity. "It 
would be really hard for the families," said Ann 
Murphy, one of the clinic's social workers, "if every 
time they had to enter the medical institutional

the poorest and most disenfranchised inner city populations who are 
frequently cared for at public facilities, the degree of stigma and 
public prejudice and misunderstanding, the likelihood that the 
mother and possibly other family members are or soon will be ill, and 
the complicated medical, psychological, social, and educational needs 
of these children and their families aggravate the health service 
problems characteristic of children with other chronic health 
conditions." 


Joyce Simpson, the pediatric AIDS program coordinator, 
organized the clinic at Yale~New Haven in 1987. At the time, the 
clinic served only 30 children. " 1989~ 1990 was our hardest year," said 
Simpson. "We would get ten new cases a month and three or four of 
them would be positive. About 45 percent of the children with HIV 
symptoms had been referred from other places. Back then we didn't 
even have a secretary. We were so overworked. We 
would have clinic all afrernoon, get done at six on a 
Friday afrernoon, and find twenty calls on our
