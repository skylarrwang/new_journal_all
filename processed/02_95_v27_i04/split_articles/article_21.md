Alvin Novick's good news proves it's hard to stay 
F
rom behind his desk, piled high with papers, reports, and 
letters, Dr. Alvin Novick tells his story. Sometimes his 
tone is bitter and confrontational, as when he talks about 
the inadequate government response to the epidemic that 
has shaped his life since 1982. At other points his speech becomes 
almost unintelligible, as when he talks softly about how he misses 
the 70 friends this epidemic has taken from him. But then his 
eyes crinkle as he smiles unexpectedly, his voice resonant with the 
newfound irony of his life. For now he is left behind, 
unexpectedly alive, to make new friends among the survivors. 
Despite his active participation in the sexual revolution of the 
1970s, Dr. Alvin Novick-Yale professor, activist, gay man-
tested negative for HIV in August of 1994. The test results came 
as a surprise; he had assumed the opposite. His partner, whom he 
refers to only as Bill, died in the summer of 1992 from 
complications resulting from AIDS. Novick did not get tested 
while Bill was ill for fear of diverting attention and energy away 
&om his partner's situation. During the months following Bill's 
death, Novick believed without at a doubt that he too was dying. 
He had many of the symptoms of advanced HIV including 
mouth sores and esophageal 
pain, but they disappeared by 
Christmas, 
leaving 
him 
physically healthy and extremely 
confused. 
Now Novick believes that he 
used his uncertainry about HIV 
as a crutch to keep him from 
"I'm trying to think about ways to 
convinced those that are still 
healthy that it's worth it to put on a 
condom because it's worth it to 
now try to come to terms with 
what it means to remain behind, 
as much a victim of the AIDS 
epidemic as are those it kills. 
Novick is not alone in facing 
uncertainty about the future and 
the search for self-definition. 
continue to live." 
Gay men around the country 
echo his ambivalent reaction to 
emotionally reengaging with life. 
which was being alone, having to recreate a life that I didn't know 
how to recreate, that I didn't want to recreate, that I didn't know 
whether I could recreate." 

Then, in the fall of 1993, Novick met someone who rekindled 
his ability to feel , to connect emotionally. With hopes of 
committing to this new relationship, he felt the need to end the 
uncertainty in his life. 

Novick expected that the test would return positive, thus 
resolving his feelings of loneliness and guilt, but instead the 
suprising negative results left a void in his life. He expresses a 
state of ambivalence about his condition in his description of his 
initial reaction to the test results. "I laughed and I cried. I 
laughed for obvious reasons; I had assumed I had been doomed 
since 1981 and I'm not doomed," he says. "The bad news is that I 
didn't know what to do because the test took away my crutch. I 
was using my uncertain sero-status as a crutch because it 
increased my uncertainty about who I was." Novick can no longer 
group himself with those who accept AIDS by dying. But at age 
69, it is not easy for him to create a new life based on a revised 
self-definition, a life that leaves his problems unresolved. He must


As he puts it, he did not 
reoccupy the space left by Bill's death; there was no point in 
making an effort if he was going to die. "Not occupying life 
meant not doing all of those things that one does for comfort and 
relaxation. I had no serious interaction with people, no surface 
emotion, irritabiliry. My senses weren't alert in the usual way," 
Novick says. 

Novick made little attempt to deal with the aftershocks of 
trauma, and assumed that death would resolve his problems. Bill 
was not the first or last person that Novick saw killed by AIDS. 
As the disease decimated his support system and his community, 
Novick accepted AIDS as a solution to his loneliness and 
depression. "Why would you welcome being ill? It allies you with 
the people whose lives are fused with yours, • he 
explains. "It seemed to me it had elements of 
resolving what I didn't want to face at the time, 
his negative HIV status. As 
AIDS and homosexual identity become increasingly intertwined, 
many within the gay community find that their lives center 
around the disease, whether HIV positive or not. All must deal 
with the unending grief for the 180,000 who have died of the 
disease since 1981. A Los Angelu Timu article in July 1993 
described the uninfected as "the walking wounded" and included 
among their symptoms bouts of hypochondria, clinical 
depression, anxiety, insomnia, patterns of self-destructive 
behavior, and anhedonia, the inability to derive a sense of 
pleasure from life. Psychologists and AIDS activists alike identify 
one aspect of the emotional response of the uninfected as 
"survivor guilt": why do others die while they remain healthy 
when both groups have engaged in the same 
behavior? 


D
espite continuous and excessive psychological trauma, the 
uninfected often believe that they don't have a right to 
their feelings or to the support necessary to help resolve 
them while others are dying. Meanwhile, many in the gay 
community not only exclude the walking wounded because of 
their negative status, but also dismiss their problems as 
insignificant and a drain on the response to the AIDS epidemic. 
But the same HIV-negative population, people like Alvin Novick, 
remain at the center of the community response to AIDS-the 
care for the dying, the political activism, and the energy to 
continue an ongoing fight for the survival of their communiry. 
Novick now belongs to a group that has not been addressed by 
the communiry lesponse to AIDS. As his energy to act returns 
with his emotional reawakening, Novick cannot ignore the needs 
of those still HIV-negative. His attempt to articulate a response to 
a void is, not for the first time, the defining experience of his life. 

T
he encroachment of AIDS on Novick's personal life 
brought him into the activist realm, and once there, his 
drive pushed him to fill the voids he encountered. His first 
education about AIDS came from the material Bill brought home 
to study. Bill focused on health issues within the gay communiry 
fEBRUARY IO, 1995 
as a graduate student at the Yale School of Epidemiology and 
Public Health. The research exposed Novick to the scientific side 
of rhe disease and to concerns about the effect of the disease on 
the gay community. When their best friend became ill in the 
spring of 1982, Novick understood for the first time how an 
epidemic within the gay community would affect his own life. 
"There was that personal element of AIDS now, around our best 
friend, and of course that had ramifications beyond that because 
he represented to us gay men in general," Novick recalls. Facing 
the intersection of his life and the disease, Novick agreed to attend 
a conference held by the National Gay Health Education 
Foundation in the summer of 1982 with Bill. He sees the 
conference as a transition point in his life. "For the first time I met 
three hundred openly gay health care providers," Novick 
remembers. "There were several inspiring, unbelievable people 
who made me believe that it was my duty to serve my 
communiry." 

Novick took up his dury to serve by filling that need. Before 
he could begin contributing fully, however, there were certain 
things he needed to do. First, Novick returned to New Haven and 
came out to his professional colleagues for the first time; he saw 
his call as a defining incident which required honesry in all areas 
of his life. He accepted fully, for the first time, the totaliry of his 
gay identiry, and shared it with everyone-including the president 
of Yale, A. Bartlett Giamatti (SY '60). Novick connected himself 
to the epidemic by immersing himself in the rapidly developing 
scientific and sociological research on AIDS. In 1983, Dr. James 
Curren, head of AIDS research at the Centers for Disease Control, 
assigned Novick to conduct a behavioral epidemiological study of 
gay men with Kaposi's sarcoma, an early-stage opportunistic 
infection, at Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital in New York 
Ciry. Through his work on the project, Novick met members and 
leaders of groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the New 
York AIDS Network, groups which were defining the communiry 
response to AIDS at that time. 

Novick then returned to New Haven and, with Bill, became 
the center of a group of gay men in Connecticut with an interest 
in helping those with AIDS. This network sprang into action 
during the summer of 1983 to create AIDS Project New Haven, 
the first formal response to the epidemic in the city. Novick 
shouldered much of the administrative work necessary to the 
survival of the organization, taking on leadership positions 
including steering committee member, co-chair, and principal 
educational speaker. 

In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, Novick played a 
crucial role in the activist movement by disseminating 
information. Few were willing to speak 
openly about AIDS and sex, but he saw 
education as the key to understanding and 
preventing the spread of the disease. Since 
he had co~e out, Novick felt comfortable 
speaking about homosexual intercourse 
and STDs, subjects that others avoided. 
Bill became an educational public speaker 
through his job as AIDS Coordinator at 
the Connecticut State Health Department. 
Novick estimates that until 1986, the two 
of them provided ninety percent of 
educational programming about AIDS in 
the state of Connecticut. As the principal 
speaker for AIDS Project New Haven, 
Novick spoke up to nine times a week on 
what he calls "AIDS 101" and safer sex. He 
addressed what he saw as a void in the 
framework of Yale's liberal arcs education 
by introducing two new classes, "Biology 
and Human Affairs: AIDS and Society" 
and "Bioethics," into the curriculum. 
Although the courses created controversy, 
he views them as an integral part of 
education about the interaction between 
ethics, science, and public policy. 

Novick soon realized that he could use 
his visibility to represent those groups 
affected by the epidemic but lacking 
advocates in the public sphere. · Public 
health officials recognize that in New 
Haven, AIDS is most prevalent among 
minority IV drug users and their families, 
and among female prostitutes. Since the 
gay community had organized most of the 
response to AIDS up to this point, those 
outside it lacked care and advocacy services 
responsive to their specific needs. In the 
spring of 1986, Novick went to Mayor 
Biagio DiLieto as an advocate for these 
groups. "Here we had a major epidemic, 
and it was among people who were not in 
a position to mount their own services; 
they were the poor and the alienated and 
the ostracized," he explains. Mayor 
DiLieto subsequently appointed a task 
force on AIDS, with Novick as chair-
another responsibility no one else wanted. 
Novick began to speak regularly to those 
in positions of authority on behalf of 
minorities, prostitutes, IV drug users, 
women, and children with HIV and AIDS. 
He familiarized himself with their 
needs and their personal circumstances 
through interaction and research. This 
made him a target for questions about the 
right of a white male to speak for 
marginalized groups. "I speak for these 
groups because they are not out there 
speaking for themselves," he explains 
vehemently. "And I fill the vacuum left by 
their silent voices because I am out there 
in a very public way. That allows me to 
"I used to think of 
[the uninfected] as 
whining and 
.complaining, what 
we used to call'the 
worried well.' But 
now I recognize that 
they, that we, are 
burdened in some 
ways more than 
those who are ill." 
speak for people who are not out in a 
variety of ways." Without him, he 
wonders, would these groups be heard? 

On a national level, Novick continues 
to fill such vacuums. He has served in 
leadership positions for major national 
organizations concerned with AIDS, 
includinl the American Association of 
Physicians for Human Rights, the 
National AIDS Network and several 
government panels on infectious disease 
transmission and treatment. He sees 
himself as a bridge between groups who 
often disagree as to how best to serve the 
interests of those infected with AIDS-
medical scientists, activists, gay men, 
academia, government officials, and all of 
the others for whom be tries to speak 
while remaining somehow above the fray. 

Novick often feels discouraged, 
especially when he looks at the big picture. 
"I think I thrive on the burdens," he says, 
in defense of his ambitious goals. He 
qualifies his statement, however, adding 
softly, "But you don't in the end-nobody 
thrives-because you'll all pay. We'll all 
pay in proportion to how hard we worked 
and the pay will be negative." 

N
ovick assumed for twelve years 
that the net payment for his 
activist work would be death, that 
he had only a limited time in which to 
devote all of his energy to his cause. But 
instead, he's paying with loneliness, guilt, 
and the daunting prospect of making the 
remaining years of his life meaningful. 
Like so many others, he lives under a pile 
of corpses he cannot bury emotionally. In 
the last year, Alvin Novick has become 
part of the growing articulation of a 
response to this problem, a response that 
will try to fill the void of support and 
recognition of the HIV-negative. 

· 
Mter devoting twelve years of his life 
to AIDS victims, Novick finds he can no 
longer directly identify himself with them. 
Before the test, he behaved as if he had 
HIV because he believed it, and now his 
negative status stands as a wall between 
him and those with whom he previously 
identified, living and dead. He speaks with 
difficulty, softly, holding back his 
emotions. "Since 1982, I felt as if there 
was a continuum between me and the 
epidemic and all those who are ill and 
dying. I knew them and their feelings. 
Now they're not me, so I have to find a 
new place for myself. You cannot describe 
being uninfected as being in a continuum 
with those who are." He wipes his eyes 
while he speaks, and stares out the window 
of his cluttered office. This reality upsets 
Novick's view of himself aftd in some ways 
places him outside of his own community. 
AIDS has become the great defining 
cause of the gay community but mainly as 
it affects the infected. Energy, resources, 
and attention go to helping those who sick 
and dying. Meanwhile, the impact on the 
uninfected-the accumulated psycho-
logical distress, the increasing isolation, 
and the constant fear-goes unacknow-
