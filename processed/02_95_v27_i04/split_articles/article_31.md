**Title: Our AIDS Inheritance**

The following essay grew out of discussion in "Women, AIDS, and 
Identity," the seminar the author taught in the Women's Studies 
department last semester. 

W
e have inherited a lot from John Locke. Our concern 
with "identity" and "property," for instance, and 
their "relation," as well as our interest in the 
reliability or deceptiveness of "appearances" all stem 
from his "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." Identity 
resides in an utterance, "that which he calls himself." Locke is not, 
however, writing about bodies that represent, emit signs, inhabit 
historical narratives. Discerning representation from fact is, 
according to Locke, "difficult to conclude from. the Nature of 
things .... [and) will by us ... be best resolv'd into the Goodness of · 
God." If we could, we might ask Locke just why he trusted God to 
provide this knowledge. More importantly, we might ask ourselves, 
since we no longer trust God in this way, why we turn away from 
the utterance and hold bodies accountable for what they represent 
rather than what they do or say. 


Of course, anyone can say anything. We are not, I suspect, 
convinced that bodies-particularly non-white bodies-represent 
as indiscriminatively, as arbitrarily, as playfully, or as successfully. 
Bodies matter to us, as a consequence of what they represent, in a 
way that words-especially spoken words-simply do not. 


Representation subverts process for no specific reason. Too 
often, the rationale, whether stated or not, is that "they all look the 
same" and "better safe than sorry." At the end of the nineteenth 
century, the subject and object of the moral were racially distinct. 
The lesson, then, was that Americans of European descent are 
better safe from all contact with Americans of African descent than 
sorry, after the fact, when miscegenation had produced a nation of 
mongrels. This turn-of-the-century myth, or apocalyptic forecast, 
presents the construction of "the color line" as a prophylaxis for the 
future, in this case a future characterized by the reproduction and 
continuity of European racial integrity. 


At this time, blackness was construed as biological and cultural, 
something in the blood and contracted through proximity, a 
disease that could be cured and a mark of inherent primitivity. 
Since blackness was embedded in such contradictory 
formulations-it could be in bodies, outside of bodies, passed on 
from one generation to the next by biological reproduction or by 
association-anxiety about its transmission, from those who 
already had it co those who didn't, resuJced in the reproduction of 
cautionary narratives. 


What exactly did white America fear? AJI sorts 
of irrational things. The loss of identity, property, 
economic privilege, and what was considered itsexclusive 
inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Clearly, abolition did not threaten to dissolve American democratic 
principles, but rather to extend them to a formerly disenfranchised 
group. In a phrase, white America was afraid of being overwhelmed 
by blackness. At the turn of the last century, America was in the 
midst. of a racial panic. Blackness was "spreading," "infectious," and 
"could end up anywhere." Racial panic reconfigured as sexual 
anxiety produced an idea of the future that could only be imagined 
as a reproductive nightmare. 


This is the story we have inherited. It has been recycled, 
reinvented, refashioned to fit the latest cultural panic. It is the story 
that, with its moral epilogue of "better safe than sorry," has been 
· reproduced in our national AIDS text. Although race has remained 
an American .cultural fact, it 'is not exactly the same kind of cultural 
fact it was at the end of the nineteenth century. In addition to 
describing essential characteristics produced by and identified with 
the bodies of for.mer slaves, blackness is understood in the 
twentieth century as a constructed discourse. It is at once 
something in bodies, DNA coded to produce phenotype, and a 
representational system that bodies inhabit, what Barbara Johnson 
calls an "already-read text." In the discourse about AIDS, blackness 
is both metaphor and state of being. AIDS, like blackness, renders 
the future unimaginable. Blackness, like AIDS, represents what 
cannot be represented. 


The conjunction of AIDS and race is not surprising if we 
remember that, since the nineteenth century, discourses about 
homosexuality and blackness have performed the same kind of 
cultural work-"othering" -and produced bodies embedded in 
"already-read texts" that share language, plot, and moral. The 
alignment of these rwo discourses only makes sense, however, once 
we realize that "othering" is not about "others" but about 
representing "them" as "not-us." "Othering" disregards the 
specificity of difference in the process of constructing an 
oppositional relation between what does and does not fit some 
imagined cuJcural identity. The result is an homogenization of 
difference. Despite the incommensurability of race and 
homosexuality, for example, racialized and queer bodies have, as 
constructed "others," both been narrativized as "unnatural," 
"diseased," and "contagious." Even before the AIDS epidemic, 
contact with racial and homosexual "others" represented a threat to 
genealogical continuity. Since the epidemic was first reported, 
however, this idea has reappeared in public discourse, particularly 
..t 
in those contexts in which AIDS is interpreted as 
confirmation for the inherited idea that the future 
of white heterosexual America-the so-called 
THE NEW JouRNAL

"general population" --depends on keeping a safe distance from 
these bodies. 


Since the nineteenth century, the cultural production of the 
future-i.e., the collectively imagined idea of the future that 
informs and reproduces national mythology-has required 
synonymous production of identifiable, expendable populations. 
Cultural production, in other words, creates its own excess which, 
for the sake of some sustainable idea of the future, must be 
construed as outside of culture as well as the refuse of culture, the 
negation of culture as well as the delimiting of culture. The theory 
is that the co~product will remain non~contaminating as long as it 
is properly contained. The risk, however, is that containment-
whether geographic, economic, architectural, ideological, genetic, 
epistemological, narrative, or rhetorical-will fail. For more than 
100 years, the moral "better safe than sorry" has been misread as if 
the future depended on the disposability of racialized and queer 
bodies. 


The problem of conceiving a future that would include these 
bodies derives not simply from a lack of imagination but rather 
from an ideologically informed misreading of risk. In other words, 
"othering" produces a confusion of literal and figurative language 
which results in rendering the risk that these bodies presumably 
represent to racial integrity, reproductive continuity, and national 
identity indistinguishable from the risk that "already~read texts" 
represent to narrative coherence. Since the nineteenth century, 
therefore, these bodies have been construed as if they are exactly 
what they represent-not necessarily because they are what they 
represent but because what they represent is useful. 


At this point, it might seem redundant or too obvious to say 
that as a result of a rather unimaginative appropriation of inherited 
categories of racial and homosexual "others," public discourse 
about AIDS has provided another occasion to narrativize the 
exclusion of gay and black bodies from the cultural production of 
the future. Although this statement is redundant, obvious, and 
boring, so are the narratives that it responds to and yet they have 
been rewritten and recontextualized for more than a century. 
Clearly, it needs to be restated at least as often. The future, 
narrativized in counter~discourses, demands it. 


Why is the idea of the future so powerful? Why must the future 
continue to be narrativized as a story of generational succession? 
Indeed, why is the idea of generational succession reproduced as a 
trope for the future? Biblical parables are, of course, relevant. 
Stories, it seems, are not only about reproduction-who begets 
whom-but also constitute reproduction, to the extent that 
subsequent narratives repeat their ante~dents (the story of Jesus, 
for example, taking over the story of Abraham). According ro 
Michael Warner in "Fear of a Queer Planet," "repro~narrativiry" 
removes uncertainty. I am unconvinced that repro~narrativity 
accomplishes this, however, since any idea of the future can 
produce only an insecure prediction-a prediction that is, in any 
case, unverifiable. Rather than removing uncertainty, repro~ 
narrativity satisfies the desire to narrativize the future as if the story 
could map the unknown. Significantly, this mapping occurs not as 
a result of prescience but by retracing the past. If we believe repro~ 
narratives, we believe them because we do not know how not to 
believe them, because we do not know how to think our way out of 
them, because we do not know how to locate meaning without 
proposing an idea of the future even if that future simply 
reproduces the past. In other words, queer and black bodies are 
narrativized out of the future not as a result of any risk for 
contracting HIV. Risk is, in fact, used in public discourse about 
AIDS to legitimize repro-narrativity. Queer and black bodies are 
excluded from the cultural production of the future simply because 
queer and black bodies have always been excluded from the cultural 
production of the future. 


Public discourse about AIDS produces narrative authority not 
only by recontextualizing the past but also by its codependent 
attachment to official science, particularly the statistical profiles of 
risk compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and the AIDS 
education materials distributed by the Department of Health and 
Human Services. Science validates repro-narrativity, however, even 
as it constructs its own repro~narrative. In other words, science 
produces the possibility of imagining a future without AIDS, but 
does not, interestingly enough, produce the possibility of 
imagining a future without AIDS that also detaches the rhetoric of 
risk from "already~ read texts." This is a discourse about progress 
that claims to be objective, factual, indisputable. This is also a 
discourse about deferral, which means that science uses the idea of 
the future to justify its lack of accountability. As a result, the hope 
that science will someday find a cure for AIDS renders the idea of 
thinking about the cultural consequences of constructing 
prophylactic categories as post~apocalyptic. 


Do we have the luxury, in the midst of an epidemic, to 
challenge the assumptions of official science or to critique the 
extent to which statistical conclusions reproduce inherited 
categories of representation? The moral of the story inst.ructs us to 
act as if science is telling us the truth, whether we actually believe 
this or not. Besides, what might it mean, at the end of the 
twentieth century, to act as if science is not telling us the truth? 
Apparently, we have given over to science what Locke lefr to God. 
Rather than discerning representation from fact, however, science 
has authoritatively collapsed them. 


You might wonder what has happened to AIDS if the discourse 
about it reproduces a narrative more than 100 years old which 
perpetuates representational categories even older than AIDS itsel£ 
You might wonder what we are really talking about when we talk 
about risk groups, HN~transmission, and auto~irnmune disease if 
science translates nineteenth~century morality into twentieth~ 
century epidemiology. That is precisely the point. We seem to have 
lost track of the subject in the retelling of the story, in the 
misreading of already-misread texts.
