Activism finds its means through many avenues; the humanities answer the 
epidemic with studies in the representations of AIDS through language.

he tenth anniversary reading of ~rrm paid homage to the 
early AIDS play as well as to the little-known writer herselÂ£ 
Roman, visiting professor of Women's Studies, aimed for his 
26 
students to re-
enact a moment in 
the brief but rich 
history of AIDS 
activist art. The 
production also 
commemorated the 
community-based 
nature of the early 
Sontag 
AIDS art movement. A social worker, Ranson held no great 
literary aspirations. Her play details the experiences and emotions 
surrounding the death of her friend Warren. With its far from 
high-brow origins, the play bespeaks a story of community ritual 
much more than it evokes lofty "high art." "We weren't infatuated 
with the play at first," says Amy Gallo (PC '96), cast as Ranson. 
"We dreaded doing it because we thought it was the sappiest play." 
Gallo's apprehensions dissipated once the lights went down and 
she entered the world of 'Warrm. She describes the potency of the 
experience: "It's not so much about high culture or great literature, 
but about ritualization and localization." 

Despite its marginalized status, the AIDS artistic and activist 
arena itself sometimes fails to acknowledge some of the compelling 
community-based artistic endeavors of the early '80s. Roman 
chose ~rrm foe his class to perform as a symbolic gesture towards 
rewriting Ranson into a history that has excluded her from the 
cultural canon of AIDS art. "She's not in the cultural history 
books. Most people situate the origins of AIDS theater in 1985 
with Larry Kramer's Th~ Normal H~art and Bill Hoffman's As Is," 
says Roman. The introduction of AIDS plays since the dawning of 
the epidemic has served to bring out the human side of a 
biological crisis that has pervaded our society. Roman's class 
participated in a historical moment, recreating and retranslating a 
tale of AIDS told years after its first rendition. The story still 
unfolds. 

F 
ourteen years after the first article about AIDS appeared in 
the N~w York Timu, the epidemic has further embedded 
itself in our consciousness. Scholars have begun to tackle 
AIDS on fronts other than the biomedical one. The staged reading 
of Warrm marks a concrete example of the way that AIDS has 
entered the cultural imaginary. The entrance of AIDS into 
literature and art has been answered by a new field of critical 
study. Theorists of AIDS probe the signification of the epidemic 
in media, literature, theater, and public policy. 

Theorists like Michael Callen, Douglas Crimp, Cindy Patton, 
Paula Treichler, and Simon Watney dominate AIDS critical 
discourse. Extrapolating from cultural and literary theory, 
Treichler presupposes the constructed nature of society'~ 
understanding of AIQS. The notion of a constructed view of 
AIDS departs from the traditional understanding of a disease 
through its biology. The study of the representation of AIDS in 
THE NEW jouRNAL 

various media assumes the 
power of language to construct 
society's conception of this 
crisis. And hence, it assumes 
the power of language to 
destroy the harmful metaphors 
of AIDS. 

Writes 
Paula 
Treichler in the anthology 
AIDS: 
CulturaL AnaLysis, 
CuLturaL Activism: "The name 
AIDS in pare constructs the 
disease and helps make it 
in telligible. 
We 
cannot 
therefore 
look 'through' 
language to determine what 
AIDS 'really' is. Rather we 
must explore che site where such determinations really occur and 
intervene at che point where meaning is created: in language." 

Akin co Women's Studies and Echnic Studies, critical AIDS 
studies renegotiate the metaphorical terms on which AIDS is 
understood. Particularly hard hit by the realiry of AIDS amongst 
its faculty members and in the surrounding community, the 
University of California ac San Francisco has emerged as a hotbed 
of critical thought concerning AIDS. Academia and activism 
powerfully fuse on the UCSF campus in a vigilant effort to resist 
an epidemic that has hit far too dose co home. 

Wich che recent loss of history professor John Boswell, Yale 
can no longer feign ignorance of the reality of AIDS with which 
institutions like UCSF have been contending for years. Several 
classes ac Yale approach AIDS from the arcistic and cultural 
standpoints, joining the ranks of critical study of che disease. 
Although slated as a biology rather than a humanities course, 
Alvin Novick's course, "Biology and Human Affairs: AIDS and 
Society" was first offered 'seven years ago, providing promise for 
future studies in AIDS beyond science. Novick credits himself for 
merging social science with biological science in the course and 
wich the attempt co show studenrs how social attitudes coward the 
disease affect public policy pertaining to AIDS. The move marks a 
radical departure from the traditional ways of looking at 
epidemics. Though developing at a much slower pace than che 
biomedical research conducted at che Yale School of Medicine, 
Yale's social sciences and humanities are gaining momentum in the 
field of AIDS. 

Since che appearance of "AIDS and Sociery" in 
r" subject of AIDS is the person with 
d, gagged, and hidden away behind 
c screens and curtains of AIDS 
which are occasionally pulled to 
order to reveal the elaborately stage-
spectacle of the monstrous.

AIDS from a spectrum of positions. Last semester, doctoral 
candidate Carra Hood (GRD '95) joined David Roman in 
teaching AIDS-related topics with her Women's Studies seminar 
entitled "Women, AIDS, and Identiry." The course focuses on the 
special position of women with HIV, the syllabus including works 
ranging from Sheila Rothman's Living in th~ Shadow of D~ath to 
Susan Sontag's AIDS and its M~taphors. T he course attempts to 
examine che specific problems posed by HIV-posicive women to 
the worlds of medicine, public health, journalism, and criticism. 
Critics more focused on what they call "real life" concerns resist 
highly convoluted theoretical debate. Especially in light of che 
reality of death, AIDS presents itself as much more than an 
academic specter. But Roman defends the work being done in che 
fields of literature and theory: "There are multiple sites of 
contestation in the fight against AIDS," he says. "I don't think it's 
useful for any AIDS activist to give up any site of power, whether ic 
be the health science, or whatever one's expertise is." When he last 
taught "Contemporary American Literature" in 1993, Professor of 
English Wayne Koestenbaum included AIDS and its M~taphors on 
che course reading lise. Fully aware of the indirecmess of Sontag's 
appeal, Koestenbaum asserts chat che academic nature of theoretical 
discourse does not undermine irs significance. "It's always hubris to 
do something without an immediate end to ameliorate suffering," 
he says. "But a lot of good accrues from analysis." Although he 
commits himself to che importance of critical AIDS theory, Roman 
emphasizes che real-life quality of the teX[S explored in his class. 
Many of the cexcs are not nationally circulated and have only been 
noticed by the limited communities from which 
they originate, such as che San Francisco AIDS 
Project.
