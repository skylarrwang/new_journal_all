Many obituaries have been written fo.r John Boswell since his 
death at age 47 last Christmas Eve, and many eulogies read. I don't 
intend to write another; I did not know Professor Boswell well 
enough to catalogue his life's achievements or enumerate his many 
virtues. But as a gay man and as a Yale student, I have been doubly 
aware of Boswell's achievements. 


No scholar has done more than Boswell to cast light on the 
status of gay people throughout the sweep of Western history. With 
the publication of Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality 
in 1980, he almost single-handedly convinced the academy that 
lesbian and gay studies could, should, and indeed must be pursued 
by serious historians. In last year's Same-Sec Unions in Premodern 
Europe be took an audacious argument and crafted a stunning 
scholarly work that goes to the heart of not only historical questions 
but current debates about gay rights as well. Its success reminds 
scholars that their work can have a powerful impact on the lives of 
everyday people far from the academy. 


Indeed, only a handful of Yale professors during my time here 
have received as much widespread public interest for a scholarly 
work-after all, not even Harold Bloom's mass-market The Mstern 
Canon made it into Doonesbury . And that comparison is vital: at a 
time when talk of "Western civilization" can seem like a code word 
for "reactionary retrenchment," Boswell's life and work are a crucial 
reminder for Yale and the wider world that progressive multicultural 
scholarship can and does rise even from studies of European 
antiquity. While virtually everyone knows about Boswell's work on 
homosexuals, fewer realize that his early work and much of his 
teaching at Yale focused on relations between Christians, Muslims, 
and Jews in the Middle Ages. And although his scholarly outlook 
was rooted in an essentialist philosophy (that sexuality reflects not a 
cultural construction but a trans-historical biological fact) he 
revealed the ways that various medieval societies could allow diverse 
people to transcend differences and make room for each other. In 
this way, as members of a society wracked by mutual intolerance, we 
all have a huge stake in Boswell's work. 


All of my understanding of the importance of Boswell the 
scholar is centered around my awe of his truly incredible 
personality. I had the chance to interview him for two stories I 
wrote for this magazine last school year. But it felt more like a 
relaxed tutorial than an interview. The subjects of instruction 
ranged widely, casually. Someho, he seemed a bit more than human, 
an unimaginably wise, warm, and witty angel. It's one thing to meet 
a genius, but quite another to be genuinely welcomed and put at 
ease by one of the great minds of one's time. 


So the interview fell away and a wonderful chat ensued, filling 
perhaps only 20 minutes of his busy November day but making an 
indelible mark on my memory. He had provided the only intelligent 
voice in a bizarre Harper$ Magazine symposium on university rules 
prohibiting student-professor sex, so I opened with those questions. 
He began with a highly-reasoned moral explanation of why such 
relationships were "a bad idea, not terrible, not like molesting your 
own children or something, but not well-advised," and continued 
by relating stories about the times students bad hit on him. (Who 
could blame them? Even though he was obviously ill at the time of 
our interview, he still possessed the handsome charm of the young 
scholar-rebel who smiles up from the back of his books.) 


He fleshed out the details of the story, mentioned in Harper's, of 
the gorgeous jock who wandered into his office hours to chat one 
cool fall day clad only in tiny running shorts. "It was obvious that 
he wanted to provoke me," said Boswell judiciously, sighing. "And 
he didn't." He went on to tell of a female student who had made a 
habit of coming in for extra help. "She would come in and I would 
sit on one side of the desk and she would always say, 'Why don't I 
come around there and show you?' And she'd Lean on me," he 
exclaimed, throwing up his hands. "Did this person not have a clue? 
I'm probably the most well-known gay man at Yale. I mean, how 
hard is it to figure out-that won't work." 


Of course I knew Boswell as a gay icon here-and elsewhere-
and wanted his thoughts on the "one in four, maybe more" 
controversy. He explained that his time at William and Mary and at 
Harvard had convinced him that Yale was no more gay than many 
other schools, just more open of late about homosexuality. But 
many gay alumni he met felt differently; he talked about some 
friends of his, Manhattan attorneys who graduated from Yale in the. 
!970s, who insist that Old Blue is really quite pink. "Of course they 
think it's a gay school," he laughed, "because they had a great time." 


My list of questions exhausted, I thanked him profusely, smiled, 
shook his hand, and left. I never saw John Boswell again, but I wept 
at his February 3 memdrial service as friends and colleagues from all 
over the world gathered to pay their respects. It was my first 
memorial service for someone who died with AIDS, but I will 
always remember it as the second time I had the privilege to sit in 
John Boswell's presence. 


He was there during the reading of scriptures from his Christian 
faith and from the Islamic and Judaic texts he spent his life 
studying. He was there as his teachers and students praised his 
contributions to the study of history and of gay and lesbian people's 
place in it. He was there as loved ones praised his courage, his 
warmth, his friendship, and his devotion to teaching as an essential 
part of scholarship. He was there as a mournful trumpet played 
"When You Wish Upon a Star" in homage to the love of all things 
Disney that inspired his yearly pilgrimage to Orlando. And he was 
there almost palpably as his sister struggled to read ftom C.S. Lewis' 
Chronicles of Narnia, the children's books whose Christian 
allegorical tales her brother read to her when they were young. She 
told us that Boswell, near the close of his life, used Narnia to 
comfort her, to explain how God could allow the presence of evil. 
Referring to Asian, the Christ-figure of Narnia, he said, 
"Remember-He's no tame lion." 


And John Boswell was there as we filed out of Battell, knowing 
that it was right coÂ· mourn his untimely death but perhaps more 
right to celebrate his abiding contributions. Many who were there 
hope in some way to contribute to the scholarly mission he helped 
found; all would do well to live up to the standards of courage and 
humanity he set. But even more in death than in life, John Boswell 
seems to me a little more than human: he was no tame lion, either.
