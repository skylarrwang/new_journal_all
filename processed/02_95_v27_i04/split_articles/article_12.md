**Title: Letter to the Editor Regarding "Trailing Behind"**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor: 
The Farmington Canal Rail to Trail 
Association (FCRTA) is extremely concerned 
about the negativity of the article "Trailing 
Behind" (TN], December 2, 1994). The 
article not only had a critical and misleading 
tone but. was filled with factual mistakes as 
well. 

Some of the incorrect information in this 
article includes: 
1. The title itself. This starts the article in 
a very negative way. "Trailing Behind" 
insinuates that the project is somehow 
bogged down. In fact, the Farmington Canal 
Trail is closer to completion than any 
greenway project in Connecticut. The 
Cheshire portion is completed, Hamden's 
northern section is under construction, 25 
miles of the trail are currently being designed 
in norther Connecticut, and New Haven has 
purchased the land and set aside money for 
development. 
2. "A glance at the list of board members 
on FCRTA ... shows that seven reside in 
New Haven. The others come from exclusive 
suburbs." The seven board members who 
reside in New Haven represent one-third of 
the Board. We serve as advocates for the Trail 
in the three communities of New Haven, 
Hamden and Cheshire. The FCRTA board 
reflects this as one-third of our board 
members live in New Haven. 
3. "Since FCRTA has been the main 
lobbying and fundraising force, it will be its 
board's money and ideas that will shape the 
trail." The FCRTA has been a major 
advocate of this project but has never held 
the purse strings. Building a rail-trail costs 
millions of dollars. This project has received 
the majority of funding from the Federal 
Department of Transportation with lesser 
amounts from the State of Connecticut, and 
even 
smaller 
amounts 
from 
local 
municipalities. 
4. "FCRTA's brochure clearly spells out 
its utopian vision ... this vision seems 
unrealistic and niive." If so, then the 7,000 
miles of rail-trail already existing across the 
nation, many traveling through equally 
diverse and more urban communities, suffer 
from the same niivete. 
5. Quote from Nancy Alderman that the 
4 
"Forestry School students' work was not 
really helpful-except as a good case study." 
This statement was made in response to a 
particular question about the management 
plan and not on their work as a whole. 
6. "Balmori's idea for the park tran-
scends the somewhat limited vision of the 
FCRTA ... "The FCRTA commissioned 
Diana Balmori to prepare the plan for the 
New Haven section of the trail. Her plan is 
therefore not at variance with any FCRTA 
plan but is the FCRTA plan. 
7 .. "City officials have begun work on a 
grant ·proposal co obtain federal funding for 
the construction of the trail, but the FCRTA 
paved the way from the city to act and has 
no intention of relinquishing control of the 
project." It has always been the role of the 
FCRTA to champion this linear park but the 
local municipalities are. in total control. 
8. "Others concerned with impFoving 
general living conditions suggested using the 
land for purposes other than a park-
building houses . .. or stores." Because an · 
AT&T cable lies under the property, no 
buildings can be constructed on the trail. 
Also, federal money for the Farmington 
Canal trail has come through the Depart-
ment of Transportation Enhancement Fund. 
This money has been set aside for projects 
such as these and in no way takes money 
away from or prevents the city from obtain-
ing other sources of funding for urban 
development projects. In fact, the project 
may increase the chances of obtaining other 
development money. 

From the beginning, the FCRTA has had 
dialogues with the neighborhoods in New 
Haven and Hamden through which this trail 
travels. The Association has always had an 
open-door policy to anyone and any idea 
that has been presented.

Association Board of Directors 

THE EDITOR REPLIES: Although wt appreciate 
the conctrns of the Farmington Rail to Trail 
Association board, we stand by the facts and 
opinions expressed in Kau Schuler s article. 
That the project fag; well behind is undeniable; 
Ms. Schuler's other observations and criticism 
stem from issues raised by numer(}US 
professionals and concerned citizem. In running 
the piece, we intended to increase discussion of a 
project little-known to tht Yale community. ~ 
hope that the FCRTA and ali parties involved 
appreciate our goals: raising awareness and 
fostering comtructive criticism. 


**Title: Letter to the Editor Regarding "Yalies Who Stay"**
**Author: Melanie A. Ginter DC '78, '81 M.S., President of the Yale Club of New Haven**

I am writing to correct some information 
in Brooke Conti's article, "Yalies Who Stay" 
(TN], October 14). There is, in fact, a 
comprehensive database of Yalies who stay 
and thrive in the New Haven area. Each 
September, the Yale Club of New Haven 
writes to the 8,000 or so area alumni and 
invites them to join. Typically, about 1,000 
join each year. 

Th.e Yale Club provides a range of 
opportunities for alumni and friends of Yale 
to meet, enjoy each other's. company, and 
reconnect to Yale. For example, we sponsor a 
monthly luncheon meeting with a speaker. 
Our first speaker this year was Mayor John 
DeStefano. 

Our events raise scholarship funds as well 
as provide a community for those interested 
in Yale. This year, we are supporting 62 local 
area students at Yale, including ten graduate 
students. We are also provide funding for 
FOCUS, a community service program for 
incoming Yale sophomores, and provide 
summer stipends for students involved in 
other community service projects. There are 
many opportunities for friendship and fun 
for those who are interested. 

The Yale Club of New Haven welcomes 
anyone with an interest in Yale as a member.
