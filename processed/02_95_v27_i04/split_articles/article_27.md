**AIDS in the Humanities**
**Author: Suzann~ Gm**

Even Novick, far from a literary critic, . 
acknowledges the power of interpretation 
and representation in the form of social 
mores. "I don't think of AIDS as a 
metaphor," he says. "I think of it as an 
epidemic. And when I go beyond the 
science of it, I do go as far as writing and 
speaking on the effects of social attitudes 
toward people that make them vulnerable. 
When we stigmatize and ostracize 
people-gay men, injection drug users, 
black and Hispanic people-when we do 
that as a society, denying them 
fundamental civil rights, we stress their 
lives. We force them into counterculture 
that often makes them vulnerable to a lot 
of things, including the HIV infection." 

The inclusion of AIDS in t he 
humanities marks how the resistance to 
AIDS takes myriad fo rms. The effort 
manifests itself in two layers: first, in the 
critical analysis of the literature, art, and 
performance, by and about people with 
AIDS, and second, in the application of 
critical theoretical concerns to texts that 
have no explicit discussion about AIDS, 
but still inform our understanding of it. 

Such studies take into account the 
staunchly activist nature of many of the 
works being examined. AIDS discourse is a 
site where art and politics merge quite 
potently. Roman states that one of the 
objectives of his class is to ask, "What is 
activist art? How do we identify work that 
comes out of specific communities affected 
by AIDS? What does an AIDS activist art 
piece look like?" 

T
he overtly activist stance of AIDS 
art runs the risk of bei·ng 
misinterpreted within the highly 
volatile world of the debate over political 
correctness. Recently, dance critic Arlene 
Croce of Th~ N~ 
York~r refused to review 
a performance choreographed by Bill T. 
Jones, who is African-American, gay, and 
HIV-positive, dispensing of the work as 
mere "victim art." Croce's assertion that 
the position of the artist allowed no space 
in which she could critique the 
performance falls in line with dismissals of 
works by other minorities. Of the epithet 
"victim art" Koestenbaum says, "I don't 
want to grant it legitimacy. It's really a 
punishing distinction." 

The national debate surrounding 
alleged "victim art" finds its local 
counterpart in the controversy over the 
Bass grant at Yale. The furor continues to 
grow over the terms and meanings of the 
"western canon" in liberal education. The 
Bass debate raises questions about the 
position of AIDS art and literature within 
an institution like Yale. According to 
Roman, the label "victim art" serves only 
one purpose: to perpetuate rigid 
classifications of art, culture, and 
education. "I don't understand why there 
has to be this sort of binary system that 
situates classical, canonical materials on 
one side as a hermetic group of texts and 
pr!)ducts, and then the writings, histories, 
and materials of 'Other' cultures as being 
two discrete categories that cari't interact 
and inform each other," says Roman. "I 
. don't think it's useful to keep those 
categories discrete. When people do that, 
it seems to me more symptomatic of their 
own investments in policing the borders of 
what counts as art and what counts as 
culture, which is assumed to be 
uncontestatory and naturalized." 

Scholars of AIDS in the humanities 
have not been the first to face opposition 
in the academy. The Bass grant 
controversy raises serious questions about 
all minority discourse. In Roman's 
estimation, scholars in ethnic and minority 
literature and art face the value 
designations assigned to them. "It would 
be unfortunate for those of us who teach 
minority discourse, or the literature of 
AIDS, or lesbian and gay studies, to 
continually concede to the categories of 
value that are imposed upon us," says 
Roman. The place of critical AIDS 
discourse resonates with particular clarity 
as the academy struggles to accommodate 
as well as resist the changes in intellectual 
discourse.

A
DS discriminates. It strikes along lines of ethnicity, 
lass, and sexual orientation. In New Haven, a city 
dominated by issues of race and poverty, AlDS service 
rganizations must do more than just care for the sick. 
The explosion of the virus in minority communities in the city has 
forced agencies to take into account differences of race, culture, 
gender, sexual orientation, and class. In a small city with a limited 
budget, AIDS service organizations must also vie with each other 
for the- resources necessary to meet the particular needs of their 
targeted populations. 

In New Haven, AIDS is the leading cause of death for men 
between the ages of 22 and 44 and the second most common cause 
of death for women in the same age group. In the greater New 
Haven area, African Americans account for 63 percent of adults 
and 81 percent of children with AIDS. The rate of infection 
among Latinas is increasing most dramatically. The fact that many 
people with AIDS start out marginalized makes it even harder for 
them to live with the disease. "HIV disease in the state of 
Connecticut is clearly a disease that has made its inroads in under-
educated and lower economic classes," says Thayer Quoos, 
Director of Client Services at AlDS Project New Haven (APNH). 
"So it is a disease of class and lack of education, and those groups 
are already overburdened by poverty and the strains of just getting 
by day by day." These problems also make running effective 
service organizations and procuring sufficient funding more 
difficult. 

he demographics of AlDS in New Haven have changed 
drastically since the epidemic began. When the HIV virus 
fiTst surfaced here, it was confined mostly to two 
populations: white homosexual males and IV drug users. APNH, 
created in 1983 as New Haven's first AlDS service agency, offered 
home meal delivery, support groups, a hodine, and educational 
services. Case managers helped HIV-positive individuals gain 
access to legal and medical resources and other general support 
services available in the city. 

Almost all of those originally infected with HN have died, ~d 
New Haven's needle exchange program, the longest continuously 
active program of its kind, has successfully reduced 
infections among N drug users. APNH now mostly 
serves younger gay males of all ethnicities. To

accommodate the reality that AIDS now primarily affects minority 
groups in New Haven, members of the Latino and African-
American communities have established AIDS service agencies in 
the city. These agencies have tailored their prevention education 
programs and case management services to address community-
specific issues. They do, however, offer services to anyone, 
regardless of ethnicity. 

In 1987, Hispanos Unidos, the first Latino HN/AIDS service 
organization in Connecticut, opened its doors. The agency has 
distinguished itself by its ability to communicate with the Spanish-
speaking community. Language is not the only barrier to helping 
the Latino population. Director Luz Z. Gonzales explains that the 
Latino community's strict Roman Catholic legacy often results in 
an unwillingness to use condoms, difficulty in accepting a diversity 
of sexual orientations, and a reluctance to discuss issues 
surrounding HIV. For many in the Latino community, Gonzales 
says, AIDS represents a punishment: "AIDS means you were not 
behaving properly." 

The dose-knit nature of New Haven's Latino community also 
leads to concerns about confidentiality. Gonzales 
has had difficulty sustaining support groups. 
"Latino people tend not to talk in groups," she

explains. As a result, Hispanos Unidos 
concentrates mainly on individual 
counseling. Those support groups that do 
operate function as discussion sessions for 
women at high risk, so that no one in the 
group knows for sure which members have 
HIV. In these groups, women phrase all 
discussion in the conditional tense to 
maintain complete confidentiality. 

Hispanos Unidos focuses on Latinas, says 
Gonzales, because their tendency to obey 
their male partners increases their risk of 
infection from unprotected intercourse. If 
the system works, women will educate 
both their sexual partners and their 
children in turn. 

Created the same year as H ispanos 
Un.idos, AIDS Interfaith Network 
responds to African Americans' concerns. 
Prompted by a Yale Divinity student, Elsie 
Cofield established the agency immediately 
after retiring from a 31-year teaching 
career in the Hamden public school 
system. AIDS Interfaith found its first 
home in the basement of Emmanuel 
Baptist 
Church 
in 
the 
Dwight 
neighborhood, where Cofield's husband 
was pastor. 

AIDS Interfaith began as a satellite of 
APNH, funded by a $12,000 grant. In 
1991, Cofield sought independence from 
the more established agency in order better 
to serve New Haven's African-American 
community. In a May 1991 newsletter, 
Cofield wrote, "Separated as much by 
culture as by location, AIDS Project New 
Haven and Interfaith have, over the years, 
experienced inevitable organizational 
tensions." Cofield believes APNH did not 
allow her sufficient freedom to address 
those health and educational issues specific 
to African-Americans in New Haven. 

While Hispanos Unidos concentrates 
on issues of communication, AIDS 
Interfaith must be particularly sensitive to 
the poverty and substance abuse prevalent 
in New Haven's African-American 
community. "The black population is 
different," Cofield believes. "Black people 
k now black people. That's how it's 
different, because some people couldn't 
understand the d rug addicts and the 
poverty, alcoholics, people in shelters." 

Cofield split from APNH primarily 
because she felt that New Haven's African-
American population would place far more 
trust in an organization run by African 
Americans and located in an African-
American neighborhood. "Blacks will 
come to me when they're not going to

· anybody else," she says. "I guess because 
I'm black, and maybe because my husband 
is very well-respected in the community as 
a minister at the church for 28 years, they 
have a lot of confidence in coming to 
either one of us.~ Cofield hoped to use her 
location and the influence of the church to 
encourage 
African-American 
community to assume responsibility for 
dealing with the virus. In 1991 she wrote, 
"In the face of this overwhelming 
onslaught in communities of color, it has 
become imperative that the black 
community take greater responsibility for 
stemming the epidemic and caring for its 
casualties. AIDS Interfaith must play a 
central role in bringing that about." 

APNH's image as an organization 
targeted primarily at homosexuals may also 
have led to the split. "Elsie Cofield really 
wanted her own outfit to some degree, in 
part because she felt that too many people 
associated the name APNH with the gay 
community, and therefore many blacks 
were not coming in for services because 
they could not cross that line," explains 
Quoos. Both Quoos and Gonzales point 
out that Latino and African-American 
communities often have difficulty dealing 
with the issue of homosexuality. "Gay men 
of color continue to be a major sourtt of 
concern to us because they are very hard to 
reach. Many of the minority communities
