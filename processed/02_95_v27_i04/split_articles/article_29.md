according to resting date-most reports on 
adolescents and young adults were 
published in rhe early 1990s and are 
outdated now. 

More available than specific studies on 
university students are epidemiological 
statistics for the overall American 
population. CDC publishes a national 
report for HIV infection and AIDS cases 
twice a year. But even these studies prove 
problematic. In its June 1994 manual, 
CDC outlines both the assets and the 
technical problems with its own reporting 
techniques. For example, all AIDS cases are 
diagnosed using the same case definition, 
which was revised early in 1993. CDC 
considers AIDS testing practices reliable in 
85 percent of all cases, but HIV resting 
techniques are far less dependable. Since 
HIV can take more than five years to 
manifest itself as AIDS, recently infected 
people remain unaware that they are HIV-
positive unless they choose to get tested. 
The latency period between HIV and 
AIDS becomes particularly relevant when 
documenting prevalence of the disease on 
college campuses. Often, people who are 
infected with HIV as college students go 
untested and develop AIDS only after they 
have graduated and reached a new 
surveillance age group. Thus, studies rend 
to underestimate the number of young 
people with HIV. "HIV infection data 
should be interpreted with caution," states 
CDC's manual. "These data provide a 
minimum estimate of the number of 
persons known to be HIV infected." 

Surveillance coverage gains increased 
importance in light of teenage sexual 
activity in 1994. According to CDC, 86 
percent of men and 77 percent of women 
under 20 have had sexual intercourse. Of 
these teenagers, studies predict that one in 
five will likely contract at least one sexually 
transmitted disease by the time they 
become 21. By compromising the primary 
immune defenses in affected tissues, any 
sexually transmitted disease increases the 
risk of contracting AIDS. 

Moreover, education about the dangers 
of sexual activity does not always lead to 
safer behavior. Ga}'le's study of college 
students stares, "H IV infection is present 
on U.S. university campuses, although the 
rate appears to be far lower than chat of 
populations known to be at high risk. The 
potential clearly exists, however, for the 
further spread of HIV infection in chis 
population." Studies of sexual behavior 
have found that young people educated 
about HIV transmission do not always alter 
their behavior accordingly. For instance, a 
report on urban women's sexual behavior 
found that single white women with more 
than 12 years of education are more likely 
to have multiple sexual partners-
which is 
considered risky behavior-than are single 
white women with fewer than twelve years 
of education. Th~ N~w York Tim~s recently 
published a survey of teenagers in Who''s 
Who Among Am"ican High School Studmts. 
The article was entitled "A+ Doesn't Mean 
A-OK." According to the survey, 35 
percent of the students questioned said 
they would have sex without a condom. A 
stunning 83 percent of these students 
believe they have little or no risk of 
contracting AIDS. 

Despite flaws in epidemiological AIDS 
and HIV studies, people seem to need 
concrete n~mbers of cases to grasp the 
extent of the disease and its threat to them. 
While inherently problematic, H IV 
surveillance reports remain important 
because they make HIV infection appear 
less abstract. They illustrate that Yale 
students, many of whom were once also 
listed in Whos Who Among Ammcan High 
School Studmts, are not immune to AIDS. ..

**Title: BETWEEN THE VINES Of Laura Ashley and Latex**
**Page number(s): 35-36**

M 
y father jokingly refers to me as The Laura Ashley 
Girl, and most of the Yale community would concur 
with that assessment. Perhaps the epithet stems from 
wearing a few too many floral-patterned long skirts 
that alternate with solid green and brown blazers. The black bow 
that so often adorns my hair doesn't help to diffuse the image. 
Such a breed of English country conservatism, combined with 
a rather quiet demeanor, clashes with the seemingly indelicate act 
of adorning wooden penises with condoms. So when I listed 
Student AIDS Educator among my extracurricular activities, many 
friends raised their eyebrows in disbelief. Some asked "Why?" and 
said, "I didn't think you'd do that sort of thing." Perhaps they 
recognized that Laura Ashley wouldn't want me filling her catalog 
with dental dams instead of rose-filled baskets. 

But my astonished friends never knew Mr. Alford, my fourth 
grade teacher who died from AIDS complications two years after I 
passed through his classroom. 
For his 80 students at the Horace 
Mann-Barnard 
Elementary 
School, Mr. Alford made Grinnie 
Winnies, oval shaped, one-eyed, 
green wooden creatures with 
antennas that awarded good 
citizenship. He created the

Yellow Book to teach English, in 
which he used the names of all 
his students in sentences that conveyed the basics of grammar. To 
teach creative writing, he challenged students to figure out why a 
close friend of his, "a most unusual fellow," had a white stripe 
down the middle of his head. 

Mr. Alford also encouraged his students to write their first 
extensive research papers, focusing on an unfamiliar country; I 
chose China, with which I associated only the Great Wall and the 
delectable roast pork that I ordered frequently from King Dragon. 
Mr. Alford adorned all his assignments with caricatures of himself, 
his balding head speckled by a few strands of hair. Throughout his 
battle with AIDS which extended through my last couple of years 
of elementary school, he informed us of his progress by drawing 
himself in a hospital bed with the same balding 
head, and a big thermometer protruding from his 
mouth. 

Though the skeptics who couldn't understand my AIDS 
Educator work didn't know Mr. Alford, they knew a friend whom 
I'll call Jeff. Or they knew someone exactly like Jeff, who 
frantically visited me one night at the beginning of sophomore 
year to say that he had had unprotected intercourse. He didn't 
know why he hadn't been more responsible-they were both a bit 
drunk, he said, partly defensively but mostly sheepishly. He 
realized too late that the fearlessness that often comes with 
intoxication cannot protect against AIDS and STDs. When an 
AIDS test six months later revealed that Jeff was HIV-negative, he 
understood that he was lucky. 

The skeptics also didn't know my own sexual blossoming-::-or, 
perhaps more appropriately-deflowering. In the midst of my first 
serious relationship, I considered having intercourse but didn't 
know where to seek advice on birth control. The AIDS Educator 
Program provided a comfortable place to learn about my options 
without 
encountering 
the 
potentially impersonal University 
Health 
Services 
(UHS) 
bureaucracy. 

So when The Student AIDS 
Educator application form 
appeared in my mailbox during 
my sophomore fall semester, I 
opted not to add it to the pile 
that had already accumulated in 
the closest wastebasket. To the questions which asked about my 
previous AIDS educational work, I confessed my inexperience. For 
my extracurricular activities, I listed my residential college council, 
acting, and tutoring. When asked what my strongest personality 
trait as an AIDS presenter would be, I embarrassingly recall that I 
articulated how "personable" I was. For my personality drawback 
as a presenter, I unhesitatingly put "self-conscious." Finally, I 
channeled my meager artistic creativity into designing a poster on 
AIDS communication. 

Soon after my interview with the UHS AIDS coordinator Sally 
Rinaldi, and then-student coordinator Allison Epstein (CC '94), I 
discovered that Laura Ashley was about to be shocked-her Yale 
representative was now a Student AIDS Educator. 

I eagerly but nervously entered the fifth floor of 
UHS for a training session that would occupy 
much of my Friday night and Saturday 
morning. I received the Student AIDS 
Educator Notebook-a large black binder 
full of articles that ranged from the first 
New York Times article reporting a "Rare 
Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals" on July 
3, 1981, ·to the New England journal of 
Medicine's 1992 findings on RU 486. In 
the pocket of the binder was the Student 
AIDS Educator Manual that covered 
topics like freshperson orientatio n, 
workshop protocol, and HIV antibody 
testing in New Haven. The presentations 
by Sally, Allison, and other UHS affiliates 
demystified issues from Hepatitis B and 
the cervical cap to self-esteem and stress 
management. Grasping the binder on 
which my name was emblazoned with 
silver marker, I left UH S Saturday 
morning tired but secure in my knowledge 
of AIDS-related information. I recall that 
despite my fatigue, I walked more 
confidently than usual. 

The Educators gathered at UHS every 
Monday night to plan activities and listen 
to educational speakers. We brainstormed 
about a Valentine's Day campaign and 
heard community health educator 
Domenic Maldonado discuss his work at 
the New Haven Needle Exchange. 
Although I always rushed from dinner to 
the 5:45 meetings, I objected little to my 
disrupted digestion. 

Over the next few weeks, I watched 
myself become emboldened as I handed 
out condoms, dental dams, and abstinence 
cards wrapped in pink Valentine's Day 
wishes at Yale Station. I watched myself 
sell T-shirts in the dining hall that 
proclaimed on the front, "See Dick with 
an erection. See Dick with no protection. 
See Dick with an infection"; the back 
asserted, "Don't be a' dick. Use condoms 
with spermicide Nonoxynol-9." Perhaps 
Laura Ashley would have been disgusted at 
my transgression of proper social decorum, 
but I still wore her skirts while I handed 
out red ribbons at Yale Station. 

I 
saw the hawking at Yale Station and in 
the dining halls as a requisite 
empowering of my shy self for the 
main task of the AIDS Educators: the 
presentations to freshp~rsons during the 
first weeks of school. In self-selected 
groups of four, we planned our 
presentations. The year I entered the 
group, the Educators decided to slightly 
shift from their traditional lengthy 
dissertations on AIDS, STDs, and birth 
control to a more interactive format. The 
shift reflected the realization that Yale 
students . often don't practice safer sex 
despi'te their keen awareness that 
protection is crucial. I only had to think of 
Jeff to know that students' knowledge 
.didn't materialize in their sexual practices. 

The new format stressed discussion of 
plausible scenarios-sitting through such a 
presentation might have made Jeff think to 
grab a condom instead of later agonizing 
about the repercussions of unsafe sex. 

After numerous jokes about flavored 
condoms and leather straps, my group 
opted for fluorescent pink Pia-Doh to 
begin the requisite icebreakers. Our 
group's coordinator, Rebekah, held a 
Mr. A. got so upset, 
He yanked at his hair . 
"What?" he cried sadly, 
"Why, I've no more hair there!"
