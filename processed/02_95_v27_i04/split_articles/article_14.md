Safer-Sex Soft Sell 
The question concerns every aspiring 
propagandist: how to clothe the 
distasteful, the frightening-or worse, the 
didactic-with a whimsy and a novelty 
that will lull the masses into submission? 
Solution: a quirky double entendre. 
Presidential and evangelical hopefuls 
would do well to heed the current 
proliferation of AIDS pamphleteering. 
The material focuses on a simpler message 
than the complexity of the epidemic 
might suggest. Its producers have chosen 
wisely to take the rhetoric to its lowest 
level; after aJI, they must appeal to types 
who regularly spend their weeknights with 
Beavis and Butthead. The simple 
message-use a condom, or else-h_ardly 
ranks 
as 
entertaanang, 
let alone 
compelling. Cleverly, the campaign 
commands with a leering morbidity-
black humor transformed from art form to 
persuasive device. Take notice, future 
mind manipulators: sex and violence 
always get 'em. 

Visually, the AIDS ads are hardly 
original. The usual icon consists of a 
wrapped condom at a jaunty angle. The 
color schemes ooze comfort, omnipresent 
pastels evoking nurseries and child-like 
na·ivete. Uglier realities disappear with the 
suggestion of harmonious innocence. The 
lesson: superficial gloss still works 
wonders. 

Verbally, the slogans chime like the 
best ad copy. Bubble letters blurt orders in 
a voice dripping with suggestion. 
"Consider this a come on," sits poised 
above an orange condom. "Put one over 
on your partner tonight," floats over a 
purple one. Punny slogans get extra 
points: "Wrap with a friend. Shake, 
Rattle, and (Un)Roll." 
Likewise, "You're 
. 
, 
putung me on. 

Underground safer-sex tracts like 
Positively Aware, put out by the Test 
Positive Aware Network, aim to be a 
mainstream, entertaining "HIV 101." 
They certainly titillate with alternative 
ways to have fun without exchanging 
bodily fluids. Some slide just this side of 
kinky: blindfolding, body painting, 
computer sex, dirty dancing, ice cubes, 
S&M. Others offer more creative 
suggestions, such as: "Mummification-
gift wrap your partner, saving the best 
parts for last," or "Shrimping-sucking 
toes." While these may succeed by dint of 
their novelty alone, novice students of 
seduction might avoid less clever 
suggestions like "Sniffing-from perfumes 
to jock straps, smells can be erotic." Take 
notes, children. 

The true 
craft of anti-AIDS 
advertising lies in its most basic, most 
bantered slogan: "Practice Safer Sex." 
Simple, to the point, it nonetheless 
combines the best of evocative imagery 
and discrete coercion. The

clever rhetoric performs 
what countless hours of 
phys-ed and piano teachers 
have yet to accomplish: it 
transforms discipline from a 
chore to an indulgence. 
If all else fajls, appeal to 
hedonism: practice moves 
from an exercise of will to 
an excuse for pleasure.

**Title: Dr. Altice: the Man, the Van, and the Greater Scheme**

Dr. Altice: the Man, the 
Van, and the Greater 
Scheme 
I have this impression of Yale Medical 
School's Dr. Rick Altice out sweeping the 
streets of a stricken city like a benevolent 
force of nature. I was almost relieved when 
he canceled the interview I had scheduled. 
"This man is an AIDS doctor," I'd thought 
to myself as I hurriedly left the office. "ln 
the great scheme of things his path should 
not be crossed by one as mundane as 
. .. 
mme. 

But evidently, Dr. Altice is aware of no 
such scheme. He invited me back, so I'm 
sitting in his office staring at a blood blister 
at the end of my thumb, like a bright red 
emergency button. I keep pushing it and 
waiting for something to happen. Three 
days ago a UHS nurse pressed a smoking 
Q-tip to the end of my thumb and we'd 
listened in mutual glee as my wart sizzled 
and popped like grease in the pan. I press 
the button one more time, and Dr. Altice 
steps halfway in the door. 

Rick Altice is as compact a man as ever 
there was. He seems to be of a greater 
density than the rest of us. His legs and 
arms are in perfect proportion with his 
torso. His features are meticulously 
arranged. Even his hair line bas receded 
evenly. This is a man, it occurs to me, to 
whom something as absurd as a wart would 
not happen. 

We shake hands in the doorway, and
