interpreted a CD4 count of 60 as evidence 
of approaching death. But once Dr. 
Frankel introduced the surgeon to the 
patient-a hearty and seemingly healthy 
father of two small girls-the surgeon 
immediately agreed to the procedure. 
Many private practice physicians tend 
to avoid AIDS patients for financial 
reasons. Little monetary reimbursement 
awaits them because most AIDS patients, 
especially IV drug users, start out 
extremely poor, and those who do not 
become so as the cost of medical care 
drains their personal funds. This funnels 
the vast majority of AIDS patients to 
university-affiliated, inner-city hospitals, 
like Yale-New Haven. 

There, young doctors and nurses work 
around the clock, fighting in the trenches 
to prolong and improve life. They fight to 
help suffering individuals, to slow the 
phenomenal growth of a world-wide 
epidemic, and to goad the rest of the 
m ~dical profession to action. At som e 
point, though, physician, family, and those 
patients still cognizant recognize defeat. 
No amount of treatment can replace a 
vanished immune system, and AIDS 
patients fall prey to the intensity and sheer 
number of infections that move in as their 
CD 4 counts bottom out. "What I can do is 
help that person make it through the 
transition to their death in a way with as 
little pain as possible, where the family gets 
support, and the patient holds onto some 
sense of pride and dignity," said Dr. 
Frankel. 

Currently, medicine has setded in for 
the long haul. "AIDS is now with us for 
the duration of human history," Dr. 
Friedland proclaimed. Even if a cure 
eventually appears in the laboratory, 
getting it to patients will present a whole 
new challenge. AZT alone costs $3,000 a 
year. Researchers now look for a vaccine as 
the next likely evolution in the treatment 
of HIV. Clinicians, meanwhile, continue 
to enlarge and modify the organized 
response to the present reality: infecctons 
that rack and eventually destroy the bodies 
of their patients.
