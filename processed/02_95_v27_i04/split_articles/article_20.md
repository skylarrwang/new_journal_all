At Home with AIDS 
New Haven's homeless HIV-positive population finds refuge in transitional 
housing through the Connecticut AIDS Residence Program . 
S 
cott gets into an argument with Jack at the house meeting. 
Scott is mad at Jack for playing the TV too loud. "Well, I 
admit that I shouldn't have been doing that," Jack quickly 
responds. He isn't looking for trouble. 

Part of the problem is that sound travels easily through the floors 
of the house. It's a well~built structure, but it's been abused, and it 
may have lost some of its original solidity. The house was 
renovated just a year ago, when the Connecticut AIDS Residence 
Program (CARP) decided to make it the site of its transitional 
housing program. 

Though everything was refurbished, the retained a bit of its 
past as a student apartment building. A rack of buzzers is mounted 
outside the front door: four different room bells, each with those 
old label strips that change with each new tenant. Scratched and 
faded apartment letters remain on the doors to each living room. 
Scott and Jack sit in the 'A' room, a 20~foot square with a 
kitchen alcove and two rooms branching off of it. About half a 
dozen other residents and one of the house managers are at the 
meeting. Jack responds to Scott's concern. "I'm really sorry to have 
gotten you upset." 

But Scott isn't satisfied with such a straightforward apology. He 
presses the issue, and Jack begins to feel a bit awkward. He 
apologizes again, and admits that he was really inconsiderate. He 
will consider Scott's needs more in the future. The discussion goes 
back and forth until the house leader feels the need to step in. She 
asks the others at the meeting what they think, and they seem to 
think the issue is pretty straightforward. Jack says he is sorry and 
says he won't do it again. It ought to be enough .. 

s this scene unfolds, Marty and I sit upstairs drinking coffee 
U1 the living room she shares with Jack and Ken. T he room 
s the same shape as the one downstairs, but the furniture is 
arranged differently. A couch and an armchair form the first corner 
of the room, with a coffee table between them. Narcotics 
Anonymous literature and Christian readers litter the table. The 
armchair faces a television, which glows with a Columbo rerun. 
Marty has brewed a second pot of coffee so that I can try her 
special ingredient: cinnamon. It doesn't dis~olve, but forms a sort 
of cinnamon scum on the surface. I'm a little disappointed with 
the results. 

Before the first cup of coffee, Marty felt obliged to inform me 
that she had bleached the mugs. "You don't have to worry about 
anything. I make sure my things are properly cleaned," she assured 
me. Embarrassed and confused by her need to say this, I said 
nothing. Marty, interpreted my silence as ignorance rather than 
awkwardness. She took this opportunity to inform me that I was in 
a house wherein every resident has AIDS and has been homeless. 
"Oh, I realize," I assured her. 

M
arty is a strong woman. That's obvious from looking at 
her, but the history she weaves makes it even clearer. A 
number of years ago, while in Florida with a friend, she 
considered a stint as a professional body builder. She began a 
hardcore regimen at the Powerhouse Gym and succeeded in her 
pursuit of muscle mass. But Marty quickly discovered that the 
weights were turning her into someone she was not. Getting 
dressed one day, she reached to push up her shoulder strap and 
realized that she could not touch her shoulder. Her bicep was so 
large, she could not move her forearm far enough forward. 

She flexes for me. Her physique is powerful, but no longer 
inhibiting. She still lifts weights now, and tries to work out 
whenever possible, but muscles are not her first priority. 
Staying clean takes most of Marty's time now. She and her 
family are very proud of her break from heroin, a sobriety she has 
maintained for a month and a half. Marty now substitutes 
methadone for heroin through a local program that she follows 
faithfully. Her doctor recently gave her a Percocet prescription for 
shingles. Marty feared that, for her, any prescription might become 
addictive, and gave her prescription to the doctor at her 
methadone program. Marty didn't think they would take the 
prescription away, nor does she think she ,would have let them if
