(CONTINUED FROM COVER) Commons was dedicated in 1926 to the memory ofYale's dead in the Great 
War. Nathan Hale stands watch over Old Campus, bound at ankle and wrist. The Revolution and the 
Civil War occasioned the consecration of countless plaques and statues around campus. All of these 
men-and they are all men-serve as one more source for Old Yale pride, and rightly so. 

But we must find the courage to imagine a day after AIDS, a day when alumni like Larry Kramer and 
Paul Monette will be honored as generals in the war America was least prepared to fight, least willing to 
support, and slowest to win. Numbers carved in marble will chart the spread of AIDS in this country and 
in the world. A place will be set aside for fallen Yale professors as well as for the Yale researchers whose 
contributions helped to defeat the virus. But the vaster sea of chiseled names will attest to the heavy toll 
of Yale men and women who studied, worked, loved, and finally died in the shadow of AIDS. 

Imagine such a monument. Imagine the end to AIDS that must occur before any memorial can be 
built. Indulge in the satisfying, if inappropriate, war metaphor for at least a moment. For if we can't take a 
moment to put aside the present-full of suffering and fear of the disease-and think of a future without 
AIDS, how can we continue to live with it? In the midst of research, care, activism, education, and 
writing about AIDS, we need the possibility of eventual relie( This kind of visualization doesn't require 
forgetting those who suffer from AIDS; quite theopposite, it means thinking about the need to 
remember them forever. 

This image has been in my mind over the months of planning this year's special issue. It began with 
the certain knowledge that Yale has AIDS: not as an abstract idea, but as a horrible physical presence in 
the bodies of students, professo_rs, and alumni. The 11 stories that fill this issue strive to approach AIDS 
not from a lofty ivory-tower remove, but from an involved and personal perspective. Through the process 
of shaping this issue, I arrived at a place of hope that allows me to imagine attending the dedication of a 
memorial like the one I just described. Or at least to imagine a place for my name on such a memorial if 
one day it belongs there. 

Yale publications, including this one, have long pointed out the face of AIDS in the New Haven 
community. Although this has played an important role in Yale's contribution to the fight against the 
disease, by 1995 such coverage seems a little too comfortably distant. We believe in the importance of 
looking at AIDS issues in New Haven, but from the earliest discussions about the issue we stressed the 
need to focus on Yale. On campuses across the country, there are openly HIV-positive students and 
faculty. Would an HIV-positive Yale student come forward to be interviewed, even anonymously, to prove 
to the rest of the university that AIDS does happen here? We quickly scrapped the idea as exploitative, but 
retained a commitment to control the urge to locate AIDS elsewhere, anywhere but here. 

Like wars, epidemics can end, although bitterly and after years of loss. Researchers are closing in on 
the virus itself, doctors are learning how better to treat its complications, and scholars in the humanities 
are examining its ramifications in literature and culture. But even as we dream of monuments and talk of 
the end of the war against AIDS, we must face the fact that whether or not we know their faces, our 
friends and mentors here will be among those lost to the disease in the mean time. 

This issue is dedicated to the hope of an end, a day when the names and histories of all AIDS veterans 
will be restored, mourned, remembered, and celebrated with the rest ofYale's war dead.
