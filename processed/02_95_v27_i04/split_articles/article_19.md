answering machine that still had to be 
returned." At that time, Simpson was 
working with a number of volunteer doctors. 
Slowly, members joined the team to create 
the comprehensive care unit currently 
available. 

Because of the low rate of transmission 
from mother to child among Yale-New 
Haven patients, the discovery of a newly 
infected child is devastating; each child 
belongs to a family that the team already 
knows. Before telling one family · of a child's 
HIV-positive status, the team talked about 
how the parents had decided to get back 
together again, were getting a new 
apartment, and were hoping that with this 
child they could begin enjoying life again. 

Dr. Warren Andiman, director of the 
Yale-New HavenHospital Pediatric Aids 
Program, first saw viruses that were later 
identified as AIDS during his time as 
director of the hospital's clinical virology lab 
at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He began 
seeing pediatric AIDS in the mid-1980s. In 
1983, he saw his first perinatally infected 
child. Perinatal transmission is believed to 
occur in utero; during delivery through _the 
exposure to infected maternal blood and 
vaginal secretions; o r by postpartum 
ingestion of infected breast milk. Between 
1983 and 1986, about two dozen children 
were diagnosed at Yale-New Haven. In late 
1985, Dr. Andiman took a sabbatical leave 
to work in an adult AIDS program, where 
the focus was to make progress in 
understanding the disease. At that point, 
many people were still scared to go near the 
infected because so few facts had been 
established. "We had never seen anything 
like it before," he said. "The clinical 
manifestations were dramatic, scary, and 
strange." 

AIDS ranks among the ten leading 
causes of death in children. All infants born 
to HIV-positive women originally test 
positive in conventional screenings because 
they still carry their mother's antibodies. 
These maternal antibodies do not disappear 
for 15 to 18 months. A more laborious and 
expensive test that co-cultures the infant's 
lymphocytes with donor cells can determine 
a child's HN status much earlier. 

The time period from infection to 
development symptoms appears to be shorter 
in children than adults. If the child lives 
beyond the first year, he usually lives from 
five to 14 years, including a number of years 
without symptoms. In June 1991, perinatal 
transmission was believed responsible for 82 
percent of pediatric AIDS cases. Some of the 
clinical features associated with early HIV 
infection in children include failure to thrive, 
diarrhea, fever, oral problems, frequent 
infections, and developmental delay. 

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), an 
opportunistic infection, is the most common 
AIDS-related illness in children. According 
to Pedilltric HIV lnftction and AIDS, about 
50 percent of the children are affected by 
PCP. As recently as 1989, the mortality rate 
for children with PCP was 85 percent 
co.mpared to about 20 percent in adults. One 
of the biggest advances in care has been the 
development of vigilant anti-PCP drugs in 
the last few years. Now, most infected 
children survive the infection. 

AIDS also targets the neurological 
systems of those it strikes. In children, the 
disease affects basic development. One of the 
clinic's nurse practitioners, Sustena Romano, 
said, "What you see is a slowing down of the 
kid. You see a peak in their development and 
then they start to slip back. They lose their 
hand-eye coordination; they get slower. They· 
hit a certain grade and just can't get past it." 

As of December 28, 1994, 427 children 
had been born to HIV-positive mothers at 
Yale-New Haven. Fifty-six have died. 
Thirteen children died last year, making 
1994 the worst year for the clinic since AZT 
has been administered to children. AZT is 
the most commonly used drug, although 
other anti-retroviral drugs, including ddl, 
ddC, and d4T, are increasingly used as well. 

AIDS has raised the et.hical questjon of 
drug trials involving infected populations. 
Since the lifespans of these AIDS-infected 
children are so short, there has been a 
movement to provide 
the newest 
medications to the children as soon as 
possible to prolong their lives. For d4T, the 
latest drug, children's doses were ~mputed 
as soon as Phase I studies, whkh check for 
extreme side effects, were done on adults. 


A decrease in cases of mother-to-child 
transmission indicates advances in this area. 
In 1990, the overall rate of transmission was 
about 25 percent. In 1993 it dropped to 20 
percen~, and at Yale-New Haven, the rate 
was between 18 and 19 percent. A study 
published in the October 1994 Nnu England 
journal of Mdicin~ indicated that 
transmission may be lowered to eight percent 
from an average of 24 percent by 
administering AZT to the mother during 
pregnancy and labor, and to the infant 
during its first six weeks. 

Many ethical issues surrounding AIDS 
become more complex with the involvement 
of children. The question of disclosure, 
telling someone that an individual is HIV-
positive, has become more complicated with 
pediatric AIDS because of discrimination. 
"Have they disclosed?" "Will they disclose?" 
"To whom will they disclose?" These 
questions echo constandy in an HIV-positive 
individual's life. One day in the clinic, a 
Chicano woman brought her infant for a 
physical. Her teenage daughter accompanied 
them. After the nurse entered the room, she 
quickly realized that the mother did not 
speak English. When the daughter offered to 
translate, the nurse discreetly turned towards 
the mother, who vigorously shook her head 
no. Even without verbal communication the 
nurse understood that the daughter did not 
know her mother and baby sibling's HIV-
positive status. Another Spanish speaker was 
asked to translate while the teenager waited 
outside, visibly upset and terrified by the 
possibilities of what could be wrong. 

The issue of disclosure comes up 
frcquendy with older HIV-positive children. 
Although these children understand that 
there is something wrong with them from 
their hospitalization, medication, physical 
symptoms, and frequent clinic attendance, 
they usually do not know that they are HIV-
positive. Most families fear that a child 
might disclose his or her HIV status to 
people who would then ostracize the child. 
Throughout the 1980s, stories emerged in 
the media of children being barred from 
schools or communities. One school went to 
the extreme of insisting a child attend class 
only in a bubble.

Even today, the clinical care team must 
reeducate a school in the New Haven area 
about the disease whenever a HIV positive 
child enters because of the rumors and fears 
that still circulate. Now, the law protects 
children from such discrimination. "When I 
first came here I thought not telling the kids 
about their HIV status was absolutely 
ludicrous "and I still believe that the kids have 
the right to know they have a serious and life 
threatenlhg illness," said Romano. "But it's 
not necessary that they know they have 
HIY." 

Doc~ rs recommend that HIV-positive 
children attend school whenever they are 
healthy enough, which means that most of 
the children start education as early as three 
years old in a nursery school or in Head 
Start, a federal program that provides 
preschool for economically deprived children 
and is specifically mandated to enroll 
children with HIV infection. When children 
enter school, their parents must fill out a 
form stating if their children are on any 
medication. "Of course we don't lie on 
school forms," said Romano. "But we can't 
write AZT. We find someone, often with the 
help of the Health Department, who can 
hold the real form that says that the child is 
HIV-positive. The school then receives a 
dummy form which does not specify the 
''Mt on the lnsitk" 
medication the child is on and gives a phone 
number to call if there are any problems. 
Although this might seem like a giveaway for 
HIV, there are cancer patients who follow a 
similar format." 

All of this leads to an aura of secrecy 
around the HIV-positive children and their 
families. "These families struggle under the 
stress of this [disease] for years and no one 
knows," said Murphy. "Many families have 
found that when they have disclosed to their 
extended family the response is very positive, 
but we cannot promise people that that will 
be the reaction. These women have close 
relationships with extended family, and they 
depend on that family for support, both 
practical and emotional. The thought of 
losing that is terrifying for them. So there are 
times when our team is the only people that 
know." The team of nurses, social workers, 
and doctors make themselves available to the 
family for suppott early on. "The disclosing 
of HIV really is a process, not an acute event. 
At some later date the child will need to find 
out that he or she is dying. By approaching 
the question of disclosure early on, the team 
hopes to give the parents the time to grapple 
with their own issues so that they can 
support their child when the child needs 
them."

schedules as well. Murphy explains, "We 
never presume to tell families what to do. We 
meet as many times as they [the parents] 
need. We might chink of every question, 
every possible response the child might have. 
They just want to process that and they need 
support around them. We problem-solve 
with the family about what the right setting 
would be--the hospital or their home?" 

At a certain age, all the children begin to 
dream of the future. "The majority of the 
kids have future plans," said Murphy. "They 
talk about, 'When I get older I want a car or 
I want to do chis.' A child sees that their 
body is deteriorating, they can't do what they 
used to do, they're caking more medicine, or 
they are taking less because there is less to 
offer them. That is when most parents are 
ready to calk to their kids. Sometimes we talk 
along the lines of'Here's what's not o.k. with 
your body,' but still never say 'HIV.' 

"We've actually sat down at times and 
everybody's been ready. One time it quickly 
became clear that the kid was not ready to 
hear what she had. She expressed, ·~ am not 
ready to know what it is, but I want to know 
how I am.' And we were able to tell this little 
girl that she's doing great." 

"I think it would be really hard for a kid 
who was dying not to put their life in order," 
said Romano. "They need to do whatever 
they want to do in their lifetime, just like an 
adult. IGds really have things they want to 
do, that they want to give away, clean up 
their papers.'' 

T
he Yale-New Haven clinic is one of 
many inner-city care centers that 
provides services for children with 
AIDS. In a similar clinic at the Children's 
Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, issues of 
welfare and the strains of inner city life arise 
to add complexity to the already burdened 
lives of these families. In the summer of 
1993, D, a nine-year-old boy, emaciated and 
suffering from later-stage infections, was 
admitted co the hospital. The bed of white 
sheets and blankets dwarfed him even 
though he stood nearly five feet tall. 

Ahhough his mother was HIV-positive, D 
was the only of her four children to have 
contracted the disease. His mother was a 
12 
talkative, friendly woman. D seemed 
happiest when his mother was present. 

Unfortunately, getting his mother to the 
hospital was not easy. The hospital had 
arranged a ride for his mother so she had 
been co visit him more often when he 
was hospitalized. But his mother was a drug 
user, and the boy had been placed in foster 
care when he was younger, along with the 
rest of his siblings. When the boy received a 
Nintendo game system from the Make a 
Wish Foundation, a non-profit organization 
that raises money to fulfill the last wishes of 
terminally ill children, his mother sold it on 
the streets for drug money. However, when 
he missed her visit one day because he had 
been asleep, he cried the rest of the day for 
her. His mother had gone into drug 
treatment many times and presently had 
custody of D. When he was getting ready to 
leave the hospital, there were questions of 
whether she was stable enough to assure 
administration of his medication. 

Clinics must also deal with the 
psychological and emotional problems of the 
parents. Providers must accept and learn the 
cultural norms of their patients. "You must 
put your values away, put your expectations 
about what life should be all about in kids 
and families, and look at what these people 
have and what they really need," said 
Romano. "Do they have a house? Do they 
have food to eat? Then comes how to g~t 
them health care. It's a challenge because you 
really have to put your own value system 
aside." 

The psychological stress and emotional 
burden on the whole family presents other 
concerns of the team. A nine-year-old girl 
with HIV was living with her biological 
father's ex-girlfriend while he was in jail. The 
woman said that the little girl had thrown up 
five times the previous day and had refused 
to eat. The team believed that the girl was 
suffering from bulimia not because of a body 
image 
problem, but from 
purely 
psychological stresS and loss. 

"[Psychological therapy] is the least 
supported of all the needs of HIV-positive 
families even though it's one of the greatest 
needs because there is such great loss, 
depression, and sadness, for the parents, for 
the kids, for everybody. There is little to no 
financial support for it and there's not a 
whole lot of people who are interested in 
doing it," said Romano. "It's very devastating 
for the survivors. Entire groups of people 
and families are being wiped out." The 
effects of the disease on the family are often 
described as "an emotional holocaust." 

Since there is still no cure for AIDS, the 
main focus of caretakers remains to provide 
as high a quality of life as possible for HIV-
positive children, including shelter, warm 
clothing, food, and rides to the hospital. 

Care providers find chat the first few years 
working in the field can be extremely 
stressful. "You hear unbearable stories that 
are unfortunately real stories," said Dr. 
Andiman. "You wish you could do 
everything and you can't do a lot. This 
disease is even more difficult in pediatrics, 
because the mindsec is chat normally 
children don't die. Generally, the doctors can 
make the kid better. The goal [here] is not to 
cu're the child or family but to improve their 
quality oflife and alleviate pain." 

"The majority of the concerns that the 
parents express about their kids are no 
different from any other parent," said 
Murphy. "All the fears and the learnings and 
the hopes and the joys of having children-
our families have all of those. I had to 
believe, though, that there had to be 
something qualitatively different or uniquely 
srressful about this. 

"These parents are struggling with 
possibly one or more children that have the 
same illness," added Murphy. "I think that if 
anything made me think, 'Yes, I want to do 
this,' the thing that really struck me about it 
was the unique kinds of supportive needs 
and struggles and the incredibly unique 
strengths that these families display because 
primarily what the majority of our families 
do is really work to live with this disease." 

And as long as the AIDS epidemic 
continues, people like Murphy, Andiman, 
Simpson, and Romano will work to help 
them.
