When Doctors Can't Cure 
The vi ru s still eludes researchers, but clinical medicine pushes AIDS 
treatm ent ever further.

n many ways, the living room of the Hospice Cottage in 
Branford, Connecticut, looks like any other living room. Two 
vinyl couches and a recliner line three walls, all directed 
toward a 19" color television. Open tape cases on top of an 
old stereo unit indicate a preference for Jefferson Starship. 
Poinsettia plants, placed along two window sills, give life to the 
room. 

In many ways, it does not. On a wall behind one of the· 
couches, posters explain basic procedures for "Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation" and "First Aid for Choking." Wheelchairs and IV 
stands crowd the floor. A series of coughs punctuates every 
utterance. O ne night last month, three Cottage residents gathered 
in the living room to watch the local news. During a commercial 
break, two of them engaged in a brief conversation, a conversation 
about neither the day's sports scores nor the weather forecast. ''Are 
you on Xylenex?" one asked. Apparently misunderstanding, the 
other responded, "I don't know why I was on Cycloserine. I haven't 
had AZT in six months." 

These days, an AIDS patient can mark the passing of days, 
hours, and minutes with the taking of medication. The patient's 
chart gives a lengthy recipe for the meal of survival. Many feature 
more than a dozen different drugs, taken orally, as suppositories, or 
intravenously, once, twice, or three times a day. The chef, in all 
likelihood a physician specializing in oncology or infectious 
diseases, must continually prescribe and adjust in an effort to 
defeat the virus responsible for AIDS and treat related infections, 
all while keeping side effects at a minimum. Dr. Peter Selwyn, a 
professor at the Yale School of Medicine, and Associate Director of 
its AIDS Program, performs these tasks on monthly visits to the 
Hospice Cottage, a home health care setting for AIDS patients. 

The Hospice-Yale connection exemplifies the fusion of modern 
medicine and social science in an increasingly successful effort to 
make life more bearable for those with an unbearable disease. 

A doctor relies on two basic strategies to keep an AIDS patient 
alive. First, the doctor tackles the disease itself. Reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors limit the growth and replication of the 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the instigating agent 
linked to AIDS. AZT usually does the job, but over time it loses its 
effectiveness. Recently, other drugs such as ddi, 
ddC, and the Yale-developed d4T have joined in 
the fight. Doctors alternate between them, hoping 
to second-guess the virus that has outwitted the medical world for 
almost fifteen years. 

With the second tactic-preventing and t reating the 
complications caused by AIDS-the pharmaceutical juggling act 
becomes even more complex. Drugs like Bactrim, Elavil, Seldane, 
Xanax, Dapsone, Foscarnet, and Thorazine-to name but a few-
target conditions ranging from pneumonia to psychosis, from 
· herpes to blindness. On one Wednesday night in January, Dr. 
Selwyn made his monthly: pilgrimage to the Hospice Cottage. 
After meeting with each of the three patients, Dr. Selwyn arranged 
a treatment schedule with the help of Fredi Vinci, a registered 
nurse. Together they faced the challenges of long-term intravenous 
morphine adminismition and the muscle stiffness caused by the 
antipsychotic Haldol, not to mention the added difficulty of 
procuring medication for the recent immigrant living in the 
Cottage at the time. 

At the Atkins Firm, the hospital-based component of Yale's 
AIDS Program, Dr. Selwyn led a medical team through a similar 
procedure. They travelled from room to room, speaking to every 
patient and listening to the ones who·could still talk. In between 
each visit, they reviewed vital statistics and discussed possible 
treatment. After going over white cell and electrolyte counts, the 
group entered the room of a disgruntled but exceptionally lively 
patient, sitting in bed eating a breakfast of scrambled eggs, 
pancakes, and corn flakes. The patient looked up and promptly 
demanded to know why he was stiJI in the hospital. In his calm, 
low voice, Dr. Selwyn answered, "We know you have an infection, 
but we don't know what it is." Dr. Selwyn's confession typifies a 
frustrated medical community. In their struggle with AIDS, health 
care workers face what has become, in many respects, the most 
elusive disease in all of human history. 

AIDS itself, clinically defined as a specific degree of immune 
system deficiency, does not kill. By destroying the body's 
protection against disease, however, it paves a clear way for 
illness, suffering, and, ultimately, death. Once the immune system 
can no longer provide an effective defense, a horde of infections 
attack every organ system in the body. "It's a very evil disease," 
explained Dr. Gerald Friedland, Director of the 
AIDS Program at Yale. "It's a painful, relentless 
disease of repeated onslaughts. There's something 
almost diabolical about the way it attacks people." In the medical 
journal Daedalus, Dr. Friedland elaborated, "Gaunt, slow in 
movement, some breathless, others bedridden, AIDS patients 
increasingly populate the hospital landscape. I find myself looking 
at healthy young men and women who are well and functioning 
even after the initial AIDS diagnosis, and like a witness to an all 
too familiar drama, I see them in my mind's eye months or several 
years later wasted and suffering, shadows of their present selves." 

The immune system decline that leads to AIDS begins several 
years beforehand. After someone becomes infected with HIV, 
either through unprotected sex or IV drug use, that person enters 
an asymptomatic period lasting several years. During this time, the 
individual cominues to live normally while the virus reproduces 
itself millions of times over. As Dr. Renee Frankel, a fellow in 
infectious diseases at Yale, explained, "It's the kind of disease where 
you can see the train coming and it's going to hit you but it's all 
the way in California and you live in New York." For almost that 
entire journey, HIV has little visible effect on its host. But as the 
train approaches its destination, what began as HIV infection 
becomes full-blown AIDS. 

Normally, a person has anywhere from 500 to 1,500 CD4 cells 
per cubic millimeter of blood. These cells, also known as T 
lymphocytes, form the basis of the body's immune system, 
attacking any foreign body that enters the organism. O nce HIV 
has spread throughout the body, it begins systematically destroying 
the CD 4 cells. A falling CD 4 count records the time an infected 
individual has left to live. Doctors look at this value before 
anything else, and many patients know theirs by heart. According 
to guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control, someone with 
a CD4 count below 200 has AIDS. As soon as the CD4 count 
starts to drop, opportunistic infections (Ols) set in, infections that 
rarely affect individuals with intact immune systems. Many people 
first notice thrush, a spotty white fungus on the tongue. After that, 
the order, combination, and timing of Ols can vary tremendously. 
Depending on their infections at any given time, AIDS 
patients may suffer from severe diarrhea, persistent cough, 
ubiquitous sores, constant fatigue, weight loss, 
fever, blurry eyesight, abdominal pain, irregular 
menstrual bleeding, and dozens of other 
conditions. 

Someone with AIDS usually deals with 
several infections simultaneously. Tuberculosis, a 
disease brought back from near extinction by the 
AIDS epidemic, and Mycobacterium avium 
intrace/iulare (MAl) can infect the lungs, brain, 
or spine. Cancer strikes AIDS patients in the 
fEBRUARY 10, 1995 
forms of lymphoma, which targets the brain and lymph nodes, and 
the formerly rare Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), which appears as skin 
lesions. An_other AI DS trademark, Pneumocystis cannu 
pneumonia (PCP) infiltrates the lungs and causes respiratory 
difficulty. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) resides harmlessly in many 
people, but in AIDS patients it causes blindness. Toxoplasmosis, a 
brain infection, causes paralysis, confusion, and loss of balance. 

Because HIV shows almost no symptoms, many people learn of 
their condition only near the end, when AIDS-related infections 
move in for the kill. Some people aware of their HIV-positive 
status do their best to ignore it while they remain healthy, never 
seeking medical attention. Last year a man came to Yale New-
Haven Hospital with PCP. When Dr. Frankel started treating him, 
she found the result of almost a decade of neglected HIV infection: 
a CD4 count of 10. During the eight years between a positive test 
for HIV and the onset of PCP, his first opportunistic infection, the 
man had remained in good condition, working two jobs seven days 
a week, living in an apartment with his girlfriend, and maintaining 
an active social life. Once in the hospital, he developed MAl, 
which caused fevers and liver problems. The patient had previously 
had hepatitis B, C, and D, and medications further irritated his 
liver. Within ten days, it failed. Medical technology helped the 
man live eight months after his initial hospital admission. Three 
days after his family went home to Puerto Rico following a final 
visit, he died. 

Currently, the majority of 
AIDS cases run a significantly 
longer course. Some of the most 
common conditions associated 
with the disease, such as AIDS 
wasting 
syndrome 
and 
dementia, eat away at the 
patient over a period of years.
