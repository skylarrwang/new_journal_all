Moonfacebear of the Golden Hill Paugussett nation met me in the 
Daily Caffe. There, he gave me a Connecticut Law Tribune article 
detailing his efforts to start a casino on his tribe's Colchester 
reservation. His father, Chief Aurelius Piper, contests this plan. 
The next day, I asked Chief Piper about the Tribune article. Piper 
asked if this was the article in which Moonfacebear said alcoholism 
and drug addiction plagued the tribe. It was. Piper asked for a copy 
and I agreed to give him one. 
"Good," said Piper. "Because I'm going to hang him with it." 
I stopped short. Now that I knew Chief Piper's intentions, would 
I be overstepping my role as a reporter by giving him the article? It 
would no doubt amplify the tension between father and son. I told 
the Chief I would give him the name of the newspaper so that he 
could find the article himself. 
"Fine then," h e said. "If you won't give me something I need, then 
I won't give you what you want." 
Rationalizing that he would find the article anyway, I gave him 
a copy. The Chief answered the rest of my questions. Still, I felt 
uncomfortable. I had given Chief Piper the Tribune article so that 
he would talk to me. I wanted the story. 
Did I do something wrong? I asked the TNJ staff members what 
they thought. They responded with their own questions. In writing 
the cover story about the Yale Bowl, Mark Badger, a Paul McCartney 
fan, had to overcome his own biases to write a balanced story. How 
could he fairly present the views ofWestville residents opposed to a 
rock concert he had wanted to attend? For her piece, Ellen Katz 
considered talking to an intravenous drug user with AIDS. But 
could she exploit someone's personal tragedy just to add a human 
interest angle to her story? 
As a magazine focusing on Yale, New Haven and Connecticut, 
we often write about communities outside our own. Sometimes we 
wonder if we're reinforcing Yale stereotypes about New Haven. And 
we often ask, isn't there something slightly sleazy about covering a 
community that has no direct way to comment on what we write? But 
if we only covered Yale issues, would we be operating in a vacuum? 
The questions outnumber the answers. We work to produce the 
best magazine we can. We want to inform and amuse our audience, 
which includes Yale undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. 
But as students, we're also here to learn and have some fun. At The 
New Journal , we try to do all of this. We hope you'll join us to write, 
to design, to take photographs, to sell ads and to hang out. Please 
come to the TNJ organizational meeting on Wednesday, September 
12 in the Silliman Common Room at 8:00 p.m.

With this issue, TNJ adopts a new format. After 23 years of 
typesetting, we have switched over to laser imagesetting. Our 
designer, Mark Badger, and our production manager, Masi Denison, 
have put in long hours to re-design the magazine. We are grateful for 
theircommitmentandtheircreativity.WealsothankTheYaleHerald 
for the use of their facilities and our former typesetters, Alex and 
Mary Torello, for their help and patience over the years.
