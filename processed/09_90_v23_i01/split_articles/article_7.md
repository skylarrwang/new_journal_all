Digging

Try digging a hole. That's what 
Lisa Brody (JE '91) did. For seven 
weeks this summer, she turned Old 
Campus into the first excavation 
site at Yale. Brody, an archeology 
major, found an ice skate, oyster 
shells and a few bottles of spring 
water imported from Hungary. "I 
had fantasized about finding jew-
elry," Brody said. "But I was happy 
with what we found." 
Brody was searching for remains 
· of "Old Brick Row," the first Yale 
buildings erected in the 18th cen-
tury on what is now Old Campus. 
The eight brick buildings faced Col-
lege Street and housed dining halls, 
libraries, lecture halls and dorm 
rooms. Brody marked out her site 
near the edge of Connecticut Hall, 
the only building that remains from 
the Row. 
Brody and a team of classmates 
began digging in early June. They 
uncovered the foundation of North 
Middle College, buried just 50 cen-
timeters below the surface. Uni-
versity officials had leveled the 
Federal-style dormitory in 1895, 
making way for the inward-facing 
buildings that form Old Campus 
today. Brody's crew dug deeper, 
scraping out trenches and sifting 
through dirt to find artifacts. Six 
feet down, they hit the basement of 
North Middle College. An accumu-
lation of chipped bricks and mortar 
forced the crew to abandon their 
trowels and sifters and break out 
the shovels. 
Debris in the basement included 
mortar, slate and many bricks. Brody 
concluded that these remains once 
6 The New Joumal 
formed the walls and roof of the 
building. 
Workmen must have 
dumped this rubble into the base-
ment when the building was demol-
ished at the turn of the century. 
"This was probably a typical build-
ing from that era in Yale history," 
Brody said. 
She hopes that her 
analysis of the ice skate and other 
artifacts will provide clues about

19th century Yale life. 
With this project, Brody took 
her studies to the field. "It's fun to 
be outside," Brody said. "It feels 
good to find something neat that 
has been buried for decades or even 
centuries." By digging in such a 
visible spot, Brody hoped to raise 
public interest in archeology. "Be-
cause people could actually see the 
dig, they would often stop and ask 
questions," she said. 
Brody began working on the 
project long before the actual dig-
ging began. As a high school stu-
dent, she had spent a summer exca-
vating a quadrangle at Harvard. 
Inspired by that dig, she thought a 
similar project could be successful 
at Yale. 
She broached the subject of a 
dig on Old Campus with University 
administrators, who responded with 
something less than enthusiasm. 
"We were worried about her dig-
ging interfering with the newly laid 
bordering line and about problems 
with liability insurance," said Betty 
".rrachtenberg, Dean of Student M-
fairs. But Brody won over the Ad-
ministration with her thorough re-
search and preparation. She prom-
ised to put up a safety fence around 
the area, refill the holes before stu-
dents returned in September, and 
reseed the gras·s when she com-
pleted the dig. "She was very orga-
nized," Trachtenberg said. "We were 
able to get it worked out." 
While other seniors scramble 
for essay topics, Brody will spend 
the semester compiling her summer's 
work. She hopes to publish her 
essay and prepare an exhibit of her 
findings for Sterling Memorial Li-
brary. On Old Campus, the protec-
tive fences are now gone and the 
grass is beginning to sprout back. 
The only physical evidence that re-
mains of the dig is stored away in 
the archeology lab. As Brody looks 
toward graduate school, she dreams 
of bigger holes to dig.
