And Then I Woke Up 
I had a nightmare last night. In the 
dream, I was sitting with my dad 
and my two older brothers watching 
a Yankees game on TV. 
Yanks 
pitcher Andy Hawkins stood on the 
mound, clutching a bushel of Texas 
ruby grapefruits. It was daytime, 
but the stadium lights were on. The 
place was deserted. Detroit slugger 
Cecil Fielder emerged from the 
shadows behind home plate, carrying 
an aluminum bat as wide as a fire 
extinguisher and as long as a 
push broom. My dad jumped to his 
feet. "That's not a Louisville slug-
ger. He can't use it. It's made of 
tin." 
"Steel," my oldest brother mut-
tered, pulling him back into the 
couch. 
"Aluminum," I corrected. "That 
bat's made from aluminum." 
Fielder took a few practice cuts 
before stepping into the box. Each 
time he swung the enormous bat, 
waves of discarded hot dog wrap-
pers and CrackerJack boxes gusted 
across the screen. Phil Rizzuto was 
doing the play-by-play, but here-
fused to talk about baseball. As 
Fielder stepped into the box, Rizzuto 
described the Chicken Fran~ais at 
Mama Leone's. "The finest sauce in 
the tri-state area." Fielder set his 
feet, took a couple imal cuts and 
fixed his eyes on the pitching mound. 
Hawkins set the basket on the 
infield grass behind him, selected a 
nice mushy fruit, and returned to 
the mound. He spat, took a deep 
breath, and started his wind-up. 
Hawkins reared back, kicked and 
flung an enormous, looping lob. 
Fielder grinned fiendishly, waiting 
for the helpless citrus to reach the 
plate. As the fruit floated towards 
him, my brothers fell out of their 
seatsandrolledaroundonthecarpet. 
"The lob," they howled. 
"Back in your seats," my father 
commanded. They climbed back 
onto the couch. 
The fruit was still in flight. 
Fielder licked his lips greedily. Finally, the grapefruit reached the 
plate. Fielder stepped into the pitch, 
letting his mighty bat unwind. The 
massive cylinder wooshed through 
the air, speeding towards the fruit. 
At last, he made contact. Splat. 
The grapefruit disintegrated with 
the force of the swing. Pulp and 
seeds filled the air, coating camera 
lenses. Hawkins, knocked over by 
the force of the blast, lay sprawled 
on the mound. A layer of grapefruit 
gunk coated his face. My brothers 
held their heads in dismay. My 
father bit his nails. 
"He shouldn't have thrown the 
lob," my oldest brother said. 
"Not to Fielder," my other brother 
said. 
At this point, the dream took a 
turnfortheworse. "Where'sMom?" 
I asked. 
"She's. . . uh, where the hell is 
she?" my father asked, alarmed. 
"I thought she was upstairs," 
my oldest brother said. 
They walked around downstairs 
calling her name, looking behind 
cans in the kitchen cabinets and 
under the dining room table. I ran 
upstairs. I rushed into her room, 
hoping to find her reading the 
newspaper or talking on the phone. 
No luck. I looked in my room. Per-
haps she's rearranging the book-
shelves or folding sweaters. Not 
there. 
"Have you found her?" my father 
yelled from downstairs. I stood still, 
stopping to listen. I heard his voice-
deep and always a little too loud. I 
heard cars passing outside, the 
pendulum clock ticking in the front 
hall, the air conditioner pumping 
air into my bedroom. I heard water 
pouring into an overflowing Â·tub. 
Water. I rushed through the little 
hall towards the bathroom. The 
door was half open. Steam poured 
into the passageway. Why did it 
take me this long to notice? 
Inside the tile-covered bathroom, 
my mother had sunk to the bottom 
of the bath tub. She was blue. The 
water was perfectly clear. I reached 
under her arms to pull her body out 
of the tub. She was still breathing. 
Pulling her up was easy enough, 
but soon she started thrashing 
around, fighting to get back under 
water. 


I woke up. 
I told my brother Jeff about the 
dream, but he didn't say much. I 
thought of maybe telling my father, 
but it's not the kind of stuff that he 
likes to hear. He doesn't hold much 
stock in dreams. "Dreams are the 
mind's way of getting rid of garbage," 
he once told me. "No reason to go 
digging through the garbage." 
I don't like dreams much. They 
have this way of making me feel 
abnormal. 
I go to bed tranquil, 
collected, well-adjusted. I have a 
weird dream and the next morning 
I wake up wondering if I'm a luna-
tic. Just when I think I've emerged 
from late-adolescence unscathed, I 
have this dream chock full of psycho-
sexual imagery .. 
I feel like I've been teleported 
back to those junior high school 
nights when I'd dream that I forgot 
to put pants on. There I was, standing 
on the lunch line, reaching for a 
plate of ziti when I realized that I 
was totally naked from the waist 
down. No rust-colored Levis' cor-
duroys, no Fruit of the Loom briefs. 
Just me standing buck naked in the 
junior high school cafeteria. When 
I woke up, I would tell myself that I 
hadn't been exposed. I'd sit on the 
side of my bed, reworking the dream 
so that I was covered with a loin 
cloth, a jock strap, a fig leaf. In 
truth, I knew I was exposed, but it 
made me feel better to pretend. 
I shouldn't be having weird 
dreams anymore. Out of nowhere, 
my mother enters my dreamscape 
from stage left. 
It's eight years 
later, and I've traded adolescent 
sexual self-awareness for creepy 
Oedipal anxiety. All of a sudden, 
Josh Plaut, Yale College senior, has 
been kidnapped by Josh P.-<!ase 
study in Freudian psychopathology. 
What's more, the dream really scared 
me. I woke up sure that I had let my 
motherdie. Itmustmeansomething 
bad. Anything so vivid, so emotion-
ally intense, so grotesque, can't be 
good. 
The dream has too much un-
nerving sex stuff for my taste. Cecil 
Fielder swung an enormous phallic 
symbol. Andy Hawkins hurledjuicy, 
seed-laden fruit. I searched the family 
bedrooms for my mother. I rushed 
into a steamy bathroom to find her 
submerged in a bathtub. These 
aren't healthy things for me to be 
dreaming. I'm anxious about the 
whole thing, but also a little bit 
annoyed. Why me? I've already 
read Portnoy's Complaint. I don't 
need to dream it. 
What's more, the dream made 
me anxious I might harbor deep-
seated, repressed feelings about my 
family. During waking hours, my 
brothers are my two closest friends. 
Why should they get portrayed as 
dip-shits when I'm asleep? I guess 
I harbor a lot of hostility towards 
them that I didn't even know about. 
My dad is a little preoccupied with 
control, but he's not the tyrant my 
dream makes him out to be. Maybe 
I don't love him anymore. I thought 
I had a pretty healthy relationship 
with my mom, but in my dream I let 
her die naked. Am I losing my 
marbles? I'd like to think not, but 
the evidence to the contrary seems 
pretty convincing. 
I should sit down and figure 
this dream out. I might be on the 
verge of a nervous breakdown with-
out even knowing it. Maybe I can 
save myself before it's too late. But 
I don't want to do the digging. Too 
time consuming, too disconcerting. 
So here's my plan. I'm turning the 
burden of analysis over to you. Use 
your particular skills to tell me what's 
going on. 
For the biology-minded, describe 
the brain behavior responsible for 
dreaming. Tell me about Erikson's 
stages of social development. Tell 
me about neuro-chemicals and syn-
aptic transmission. Draw a diagram 
of my hippocampus. I'm even will-
ing to take part in experiments ex-
ploring family dynamics. 
What-
ever it takes. 
Maybe you have a sociological 
background. You can tell me a bit 
about socialization. Talk to me about 
group dynamics. Tell me how the 
mores of American Jewish culture 
have affected my relationship with 
my mother. Explain how the dy-
namic between parent and child can 
be influenced by a whole range of 
factors. Describe how my father's 
task-oriented outlook influences my 
perceptions of the family unit. De-
fine sanctions and delineate the pa-
rameters of social control within a 
family. How are boundaries estab-
lished? How are they enforced? 
And for the literary-minded, how 
about some close reading. Your job 
is to construct a problematic, but 
attainable, coherence. Make some 
sense out of my dreamscape. What 
difference does the author-or 
dreamer-make? Show me the ar-
chetypal myth structures to which 
my dream corresponds. Discuss how 
the dream laments the difficulties 
of signification. Do what you can. 
When you finish with your 
analysis, type up a summary of your 
findings. Print the document out, 
place a folded copy in a business 
envelope and shove it in the back of 
your sock drawer. It's quite pos-
sible I'm nuts, but I don't think I 
am. I hope you don't either. If you 
do, I'd rather not hear about it. Let 
me labor under the delusion that 
I'm totally normal. If need be, 
condemn me for having a false-con-
sciousness. I can live with that. 
After all, it was only a dream. Ill)
