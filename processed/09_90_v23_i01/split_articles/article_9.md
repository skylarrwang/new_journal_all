Freshman year. Naples. Thursday 
night. 
"So what do you think you'll do 
when you get out of Yale?" asks a 
friend with torrents of blond hair 
and eyes as beautiful and wise as 
those of Kurt Vonnegut. 

I sip my beer. I look down at the 
table. I look up into those eyes and 
swell with love for this person and 
with love for blurred visions ofiride-
pendence. 

"One thing is for bloody sure, " I 
say. "I will not be sitting behind a 
desk waiting for the clock to tick 
over to 5:00p.m. No way." 

"What then, if not a desk job?" 

I come back with the most em-
phatic reply I can muster.· I feel the 
emotion of the reply stretch and 
quiver. "I simply want to live." 

Without the atmosphere and the 
eye contact between two friends, 
this statement loses a lot. It verges 
on romantic ridicule. But I meant 
what I said. At the very least, I 
wanted a life with little care for 
money or station but with an em-
phasis on friendship and learning. 

On the outer edges of my ideals, I 
envisioned European walks that 
stretched from Bordeaux to Budapest 
and dreams of Byronic sensuality 
sweetened by long summer evenings. 

Call me an unrealistic fool, but why 
should such ideas only belong to 
novels or immaturity? 

Junior Year. Art History Lecture. 
Back row. 
"As we can see here," the pro-
fessor says, flipping his head back 
to emphasize the coming statement 
and pointing up to a slide. "The 
curve of Picasso's brush stroke is in 
obvious counterpoint to a psycho-
logical framework of painting. The 
paint is simply released in rejection

of any Freudian self-awareness. 
Close, if you will, to an orgasm." 

I lean over and whisper in a 
friend's ear, "What the hell is he 
talking about?" 

"No idea," she replies. "Some-
thing about an orgasm." 

I fumble back through the pages 
of my notes. Nothing. For seven 
weeks I have been coming to this 
. room. Each time, I ask why I bother. 
The professor's gentrified language 
is unclear, which annoys me. As I 
study the curves and meanings of 
art, a guilty voice perks up from the 
back of my mind: 

"What does the phallic imagery 
in a Picasso painting do for you? 
Does it really help you understand 
the world better?" asks the voice. "I 
hope so, because it certainly won't 
help you find a job when you gradu-
ate." The voice turns cold and digs 
deep. "Why, Chris, are you so scared 
Gronger MooreheOd/The New JoumOI 
of the real world?" 

Like a drug addict in denial of a 
problem, I shut the voice down. I 
remind myself that the study of art 
history requires the all-important 
skill of analysis. I'm learing how to 
think, I tell myself. But the voice 
comes back. And the question of my 
future after Yale lingers. 

Summer Intership. Corporate office. 
First Day. 
To be a professional writer, you need 
a desk. In front of me sits a computer, 
a thesaurus, a copy of Strunk and 
White and a coffee mug. "All good 
journalists drink coffee," says the 
editor. I sip my coffee, trail my 
fingers along the computer keyboard 
'and look at the clock. 

The voice won out. I am pad-
ding my resume with recommenda-
tions and getting a taste of the 
magazine business. What does it 
matter if I don't like coffee; surely, 
after some furious late night editing, 
I will get to like the drink. I am 
becoming a professional. 

Writing about golf for a trade 
magazine may not be the novel that 
I once dreamed about, but I do have 
a passion for the game. Ifl've decided 
not to go gallivanting around Greece 
as I did last summer, then I might 
as well do something that interests 
me. 

"Chris, could I see you in my 
office please?" My boss calls me on 
the phone. "I have some lists I would 
like you to research and compile." 

Enough of the diary-style in-
serts, already. 

They don't fool 
anyone. The summer drifted along. 
My job was not horrible. In some 
ways I enjoyed it. In addition to 
asking me to compile lists, the edi-
tors and assistants helped me write 
a few things. I worked for the fash-
ion editor who swished through the 
corridors, always in a rush from one 
important project to the next. 

Halfway through the summer 
my boss sensed my diminishing en-
thusiasm for list compiling. She 
pulled me aside and gave me a pep 
talk. This was kind. 

"This magazine is a money

maker, a winner, a good place to 
be," she said. She ran her finger-
nail along the thick edge of the 
magazine, caressing the binding. as 
one might touch a silk shirt. I asked 
her if she played golf. "No," she 
replied. "It's a bit of a silly game." I 
thanked her for the talk. 

The next morning as I sat at my 
desk, a glimpse of perspective 
brushed over me. It felt like two 
tequila shots thrown back one after 
another. How often do we think 
about our lives? Where are we go-
ing? How many of us know that the 
bank, the hospital, the newspaper 
will be our workplaces? 

A new voice emerged. 

"Is this it? Do I really have the 
arrogance to expect more out of life 
than typing in stories about a cer-
tain type of golflabel, a story that is 
little more than an advertisement 
for the company?" 

Unlike my boss, I did not be-
lieve in the magazine. Nor did I 
value its place in society. I do, 
however, admire the game of golf. 
My inner voice, the closest thing to 
an antenna for one's character, be-
gan mumbling, and an echo of doubt 
bubbled around, makingitselfheard. 

"Hey, psst, Chris, you old cod-
ger," said the genial voice. "What 
are you up to here? What's the plan? 
Is writing at this magazine the way 
you see your life?" 

The answer echoed back, "Er, 
no. Not really." 

Ever since I came to America 
from England five years ago, I have 
felt a pressure to consume, to nip 
down to the local Macy's to browse 
and buy. America is built around 
consumption. I noticed this pressure, 
pulling and bending my character 
around, and I felt damned if I was 
going to let it shape any part of my 
life. 

In just the same manner as the 
pressure to consume has edged in 
on my spending habits (remember 
that scene in Gats by where Redford 
tosses the shirts around the room? 
-that scene could now be filmed in 
my closet), the experience of Yale 
University has touched another part 
of my character. 

Yale encouraged me to investi-
gate the interesting topic and to 
enter those esoteric intellectual do-
mains that few people outside of 
universities know exist. What have 
I found? Most of the time, I've been 
engaged, interested, stimulated. I've 
been allowed to wander around 
through the centuries, picking at 
the juicy parts of thought and his-
tory. From the Ming dynasty to a 
never-ending Faulkner sentence, 
Yale has given me an environment 
in which to drift away from present-
day concerns. When I tried to figure 
out the meaning of The Magic 
Mountain ( in under seven pages no 
less), I soon forgot what day it was. 
I wasn't too sure of the month, ei-
ther. All bound up in the cocoon of 
Yale University, I found it very easy 
to let events on the outside slip by. 
Every now and then I might catch a 
headline, or a quick smirk from Peter 
Jennings. 

One day as I cycled out to the 
golf course, I saw folks struggling to 
make a living, reminding me that 
there was life outside of Yale. I 
began to wonder what my role in 
the world would be. At the very 
time I drifted away from the real 
world, a part of me demanded to 
know what preparation I was mak-
ing to enter life after Yale. This 
worry became clamorous after classes 
such as the art history lecture with 
the sexually preoccupied professor. 

My statement at Naples at the be-
ginning of freshman year was still 
with me, but it was tempered by 
three years of drifting at Yale. The 
date of graduation and the payback 
ofthe$15,000loansdrewevencloser. 

Thus, I opted for the internship. 

And there I learned that the only 
true professional is the person who 
believes in what he or she is doing. 

May 26, 1991. Black gown and cap. 
(God willing. Anyone can flunk the 
senior essay, right?) 

I've just lost my cap. It landed 
on the roof of'I'imothy Dwight College 
when I threw it in the air. "So what 
do you think you'll do when you get 
out of Yale?" asks a friend with 
blond hair and beautiful eyes. He 
smiles mischievously. 

I hug my friend, trying to hold 
onto a friendship that from now on 
will never be the same. 

Who knows, I think. Nothing is 
resolved. Nothing is certain. In two 
years, I might be a shepherd in the 
Northern Territory of Australia, or 
a management consultant in 
Greenwich, Connecticut. Both jobs 
would be fme if! made a friend like 
the man I hold onto now. I pull 
back, look into those eyes, and say, 
"Didn't I tell you? I'm following you 
to Law School."
