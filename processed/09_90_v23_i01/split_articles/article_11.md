Chief Aurelius Piper sits In his home on the Golden Hln 
reservation In TNmbull. "I want to ltve Indian," he says. 
Moonfacebearclaims the Golden 
Hill Paugussetts are already recog-
nized by the federal government, 
because the tribe gets help from 
some federal agencies. In 1979, the 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development granted the tribe 
$69,000 for the purchase of the land 
in Colchester, and later awarded 
them $46,500 more. Although the 
Paugussetts have received no other 
rnoney, Moonfacebearsaysthatthe 
tribe deals with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Treasury, the Department 
of Health and Human Services and 
the Department of Agriculture. 
"There's no way that the federal 
government could say we're not rec-
ognized," said Moonfacebear. 


Even if Moonfacebear fails to 
establish federal recognition for the 
tribe, a state Superior Court case 
up for argument this fall could be 
his ace in the hole. Schaghticoke us. 
Potter involves a dispute over tim-
ber sales on the unrecognized 
September 7. 1990 
Schaghticoke reservation. The case 
pits tribal sovereignty against state 
jurisdiction. Last year, a lower court 
held that the state does not have 
civil jurisdiction over any Native-
American tribe in Connecticut. The 
state, in appealing the decision, will 
argue that it does have legal au-
thority on the reservation because 
the Schaghticoke tribe is not feder-
ally recognized. If the Superior 
Court denies that the state has ju-
risdiction over the Schaghticokes, 
Moonfacebear may be in luck. Ac-
cording to Julia Bradley, staff at-
torney for the Connecticut Indian 
Law Project, such a ruling would 
extend gambling privileges to all 
unrecognized tribes. 


For now, Moonfacebear has 
agreed to postpone development of 
the casino and investigate other 
economic options for the Colchester 
reservation. Manchester represen-
tative Jack Thompson, chairman of 
the Connecticut Indian Affairs Task 
Force, hopes to help Moonfacebear 
devise some progra:tns for the tribe. 
Thompson suggests that the tribe 
might use reservation land as a 
landfill or start a cottage industry. 
Tribes in the western United States 
have raised money through such 
programs. 


Thompson has no specific plans 
for the Golden Hill Paugussetts for 
now. "We're really treading water 
at the moment," said Thompson. 
"But Moonfacebear is self-educated 
and a pretty bright guy, and we 
hope to work something out." Chief 
Piper believes he, not his son, should 
be dealing with Thompson. The 
state representative thinks that 
Moonfacebear is the appropriate 
authority. 
"As I understand it, 
Moonfacebear is talking about the 
•• 
Colcuesrer reservation, which he is 
in charge of," said Thompson. 


As the conflict between father 
and son heats up, both Chief Piper 
and Moonfacebear insist that they 
''Anything is legal 
that you sign. It's 
get one Indian to 
sign and they take 
the whole thing. , 
want what is best for the tribe. In 
the past, both have defended tribal 
interests. Piper had to struggle for 
eight years before Connecticut would

gr&nt the tribe absolute ownership 
of the Trumbull quarter-acre. In 
1981, Moonfacebear refused to give 
up the Colchester land when the 
state threatened foreclosure for 
unpaid taxes. Moonfacebear prom-
ised to use force if necessary, and 
the state recognized the reserva-
tion that year. Today, backbiting 
between father and son overshad-
ows long- term tribal plans. Their 
personal dispute now shapes the 
future of the Golden Hill Paugussett 
nation. A peaceful resolution appears 
unlikely. "We're at a total war," 
said Moonfacebear. "The best man 
Will Win."
