Although the weather is mild for a late June evenin& 
the 62,000 bodies around me make the air feel hot and 
sticky. The crowd, docile until now, leaJn to its feet. 
screaming wildly as the Sgt. Pepper'sguitarriffblasts 
from the stage. I can't see Paul McCartney anymore. My 
view is completely blocked by a sea of waving arms. 1 
climb to the top of the bleoch.ersjust to confirm that I'm 
still in the Yale Bowl. 

Actually, I'm j.n my room, listening to my Beatles 
CD. Paul McCartney never came to New Haven, so I 
could not have been at the concert. Like the rest of the 
city, I can only imagine Paul live at the Yale Bowl. 

Many residents of Westville-the neighborhood 
surrounding the Bowl-breathed a sigh of relief when 
the ex-Beatle pulled out of the gig. A 1980 Eagles 
concert and the annual football game between Yale 
and tbe Univei'BityofCenoecticuthave made Westville 
reaidenta~waryofapecialevents at th&Bowl.

When news of tlie proposed McC~rtney concert 
reached Westville last winter, some residents tialkiJd. 
They worried that their neighborhood would be tumed 
into an entertainment district. Two other schemes to 
use the Yale Bowl intensified their fears. Last inim-
mer~ the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut_ Inc., in-
dicated that they wanted to J)ljng the IIDB.Ual VOlvo

Foundation members figured that,..ale's ~courts­

perfect new home for the tournament. The other 
proposal, devised by a joint New Haven and New Y.ork 
City commisaion, suggested that the two cities make a 
bid foe World Cup 1994 soccer games.

New Haven residents living further from the Bowl 
hailed the McCartney concert as a dream come true.

1980 Eagles Concert. "There mi8ht have been a little

"But I doubt anybody was burned out of his house or

arrested twelve people at the concert for disorderly

70,000-seat stadium?" Sorcinelli 
shoots back: "Most of us are an-
swering, 'We bought a home next to 
a university athletic facility, not 
next to the Meadow lands or Foxboro 
Stadium.'" 

On May 25, Sorcinelli got her 
wish. Alex Kochian, McCartney's 
agent, announced that he had 
dropped New Haven from the tour. 
I ' The ex-Beatle, Kochian said, did 
not want to cause strife in the city. 
Though some Westville residents 
felt \'indicated, other New Haveners 
expressed disappointment. "I think 
it was a tragedy," Nemerson said. 
"It would have been fun-something 
the whole community would have 
remembered for a generation." 

Although the McCartney pro-
posal died in the planning stage, 
the Volvo tournament fared better. 
The Westville Residents Associa-
tion did not move to stop the tour-
nament from coming to town. Since 
the Volvo tournament would not 
bring in as many people as a rock 
concert or the Yale-UConn game, 
Sorcinelli did not see it as a prob-
lem. During the week-long tourna-
ment in August, 121,000 fans 
crowded a temporary stadium in 
Parking Lot A. Over the next eleven 
months, Jewel Productions, Ltd., 
the tournament producer, plans to 
build a permanent facility in Lot A 
to house the annual matches.
