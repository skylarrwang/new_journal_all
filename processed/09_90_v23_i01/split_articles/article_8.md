raised the couple's three sons. In 
spite of their prosperity, the Connells 
felt dissatisfied. Burned out and 
bored by Westchester County com-
muter life, they wanted to get out. 
"We basically felt we wanted a change 
in our lives," Susan said. 

They 
decided to open up a small business 
far from the pressures of the big 
city. In 1980, they left New York. 
Hugh and Susan, both connois-
seurs of fine wines, wanted to own a 
vineyard. They hoped to produce 
vintages that could compete with 
their French favorites from Bur-
gundy and Bordeaux. Their plan: 
buy a run-down dairy farm in North 
Stonington, near the port town of 
Mystic, and transform it into a win-
ery. "Everyone thought we were 
crazy," Susan said. "But they ap-
preciated that we had the courage 
to do what we wanted to do." In 
1981, 
the 
Connells 
opened 
Crosswoods winery, named after 
their former home in New York. 

The Connells were determined 
to produce a quality wine. They 
wanted to cultivate Vinifera grapes, 
from which the world's finest wines 
have been made for centuries. But 
Vinifera traditionally grows only 
in warm areas like the Italian 
Piedmont and Northern California's 
Napa Valley. Experts believed the 
harsh climate of the northeastern 
United States would destroy the 
fragile grapes. To introduce Vinif-
era to the region, researchers at 
Cornell University crossed it with 
Labrusca, a grape native to New 
England. This hybrid helped the 
Finger Lakes region of upstate New 
York become a major wine-produc-
ing area. 

The Connells had no interest in 
cultivating hybrids. They wanted 
to grow pure Vinifera. D~spite the
September 7, 1990 
warnings of experts, they remained 
commited to what Hugh likes to call 
the "noble grape." 

Subtle variations in New 
England's soil and climate, the two 
most crucial variables in wine pro-
duction, worked to the Connells' 
advantage."AJongthecoastofCon-
necticut, within ten miles of the 
ocean, the climate is fine for Vinif-
era," said Hugh. "It's similar to 
Burgundy and Bordeaux. As you go 
further west, you move into a colder 
climate. You have to stick with 
hybrids there." Moderating winds 
from the ocean protect coastal grapes 
from premature budbreak in the 
spring and postpone the killing frosts 
of autumn. 

Crosswoods is perfectly located 
to benefit from the sea's favorable 
air, and the Connells have succeeded 
in producing some of the imest 
Vinifera wines in the eastern United 
States. 

Since the winery's first 
vintage in 1984, journals such as 
the Wine Spectator and Robert 
Parker's Wine Advocate have given 
Crosswoods rave reviews. 

Elliot Brause, proprietor of 
Quality Wines in New Haven, says 
the accolades are richly deserved. 
"Of all the New England wineries, 
Crosswoods is probably in the top 
three or four overall," he said. "Its 
Granger Mooreheod/The New Joumal 
quality is good and its consistency 
is excellent." 

He adds that 
Crosswoods has a strong reputa-
tion among the wine purchasing 
public. "I think it does as well as 
any boutique winery in the area," 
said Brause. 

The Connells take pride in their 
success. Not only have they silenced 
the naysayers, they have spear-
headed a regional trend toward 
Vinifera. "At the time we began 
growing Vinifera, people said we were 
crazy," said Hugh. "But we did it, 
and we were right. Now everybody's 
growing Vinifera." 

For small "boutique" vintners 
like the Connells, Vinifera may be 
the key to economic survival. In the 
United States, a large number of 
foreign and domestic producers battle 
for the affections of an increasingly 
selective market. Small wineries, 
which are generally unable to pro-
duce as inexpensively as their larger 
counterparts can, often have to rely 
on the specific quality of their wine 
to attract a loyal following. "People 
are buying high quality wines," said 
Hugh. "Jug and cheap wine sales 
are way off. 
People don't want 
something that's produced by the 
zillion gallons and has no character."
