High Stakes in a House Divided

Aurelius Piper drives his green-Dodge van through the 
wealthiest area of Trumbull, just southwest of New Haven. He slows down in front of a log cabin on a 
quarter-acre plot nestled between the Colonial-style 
houses on Shelton Road. He pulls into the dirt driveway as one of his sons is pulling out to go to work. 
Piper's wife Marsha, his two youngest children and 
visitors from Tennessee emerge from the house to 
greet him. Piper, a spry 74- ----- - - - ------------
year-old, bounds into the cabin to answer a phone call. 
Inside, photos of Piper and his family, landscape paintings and headwork decorate the walls. The head of a bear is
mounted over the fireplace. 
This cabin, home to Piper 
and his family, is a reservation for the Golden Hill 
Paugussetts, one of five Native-American tribes in Connecticut. Aurelius Piper is the tribal chief. 
"I don't want to live like the whiteman," said Piper, also called Chief Big Eagle. "I want to live Indian." 
Right now, most of the approximately 140 Paugussetts don't practice a traditional Native-American lifestyle. 
Only Piper and his immediate family live on the reservation. Other tribe members rarely attend religious 
ceremonies, cultural events or tribal meetings at the 
Trumbull quarter-acre. 
The Golden Hill Paugussetts once occupied over 
200 acres in the Bridgeport-Trumbull area before the 
state whittled it down to the present reservation. 
Although the tribe acquired 107.5 acres in Colchester 
eleven years ago, one of Chief Piper's 18 children , 
Kenneth Piper-Moonfacebear, is still the only tribe 
member living there. "Nobody cares about a reservation in the boondocks," Chief Piper said. A disintegrating tribal identity has left the Golden Hill Paugussetts disjointed and out of touch. "My tribe is on the brink 
of dying," said Moonfacebear. 
He thinks he can revitalize the tribe. A few months 
ago, Moonfacebear hatched a plan to open a gambling 
hall on the reservation in Colchester. If Moonfacebear 
can start a casino, he could raise much-needed funds 
for the tribe. The Mashantucket Pequots, another 
Connecticut tribe, started a bingo hall on their reservation in Ledyard four years 
ago. They now bring in 1,100 
players a night from as far 
away as Nova Scotia and 
Ohio. The bingo operation 
earns several million dollars 
a year and provides jobs for 
tribe members. 
Multiple barriers stand 
between Moonfacebear and a game of blackjack. For one, Chief Piper wants to keep his son from opening a 
casino on tribal lands. "Gambling is not the cure-all for 
the tribe," said the Chief. "All it brings on is fast 
women, fast cars, booze, drugs and you name it." Chief 
Piper claims that Moonfacebear has no authority to 
promote gambling on the Colchester reservation. "My 
son Kenneth is not the Chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett 
nation," said Piper. "He does not speak for the tribe. 
He speaks for himself." 
While Moonfacebear maintains that the casino 
will benefit the tribe, he concedes that he is not getting 
any support from fellow tribe members. His own step-
brother, Aurelius Piper Jr., whom Moonfacebear recently appointed as a council chief in charge of tribal 
disputes, sides with their father. 
"I'm opposed to 
gambling ventures at this time," said Piper Jr. "I've 
never seen anything good come of it." 
Moonfacebear has promoted his gambling scheme

in Colchester, he rarely sees other Paugussetts. Chief 
Piper, on the other hand, talks regularly with the tribe 
members living in urban centers throughout Fairfield 
County. According to Moonfacebear, his father manipulates tribal opinion and unjustly wields power 
over the Golden Hill nation. "I'm feeling like this is a 
Ferdinand Marcos or Ceaucescu situation," said 
Moonfacebear. "My father is an authoritarian, totalitarian type of individual." Moonfacebear believes that 
his father opposes the casino proposal because the 
Chief is preoccupied with tribal control. "He is one of 
the reasons the tribe hasn't been able to go anywhere 
in eight years," Moonfacebear said. 
The casino dispute dramatizes the longstanding 
rift between father and son. Since 1980, Moonfacebear 
and Chief Piper have vied for power over the tribe. 
Moonfacebear argues that his father abdicated his 
authority in two letters that the Chief filed with the 
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. 
In 1977, Chief Piper wrote: "You people have assimilated into the main stream of society. I can no longer 
carry the nation .. .it is time to sever all relations as 
president of the Golden Hill Development Corporation." 
Five years later, Chief Piper appointed 
Moonfacebear as a war chief of the tribe in charge of 
the Colchester reservation. "The emblem on your shirt, 
the eagle, with the word 'chief,' stands as I stand," the 
Chief wrote. Although Piper specifically designated 
his son as a sub-chief, Moonfacebear claims that Chief 
Piper handed down all authority to his son. "Whatever 
power he had, through that emblem, transferred his 
power to me," said Moonfacebear. "By 1982, I was the 


only legitimate official of the tribe in existence." 
Chief Piper says that he only named his son war 
chief of the Colchester reservation to get Moonfacebear 
out of trouble. "He went out there after he got through 
running drugs for his sister in Bridgeport. He had 
nowhere to go," said Piper. "At the time, people said 
maybe by being out in the woods by himself, he'd learn 
something." Chief Piper claims the real authority 
remains in his hands. "Moonfacebear doesn't have any 
power. The Clan Mother is the only one who can take 
away power," Piper said, defending his leadership. 
"I've had the tribe's power-of-attorney since 1973 and 
nobody has gone to court to revoke it yet." 
Yet in a letter to the DEP, Piper granted his son 
permission to write checks from the Golden Hill 
Paugussett Tribal Fund. As a result, state officials 
now recognize Moonfacebear as a legal representative 
of the tribe. They have discussed the casino almost 
exclusively with Moonfacebear. Piper resents the state 
for meddling in what he sees as strictly a family affair. 
"Moonfacebear's problem is his own hatred for the 
family," the Chief said. "In the old way you could 
banish him from the tribe. But now with your court 
system and your democratic process and your legal



papers-anything is legal that you 
sign. It's get one Indian to sign and 
they take the whole thing." 
One thing state officials want 
to keep any Paugussett from signing: a gambling contract. Officials 
maintain that Connecticut law prohibits the Las Vegas-style casino 
that Moonfacebear wants to introduce. Moonfacebear discovered the 
state's opposition last month when 
he announced his intentions to start 
a gambling hall. If he goes ahead 
with his plan, he could face arrest. 
"If someone commits an act that we 
consider a violation of state statutes on gambling, we would apply 
to a judge for an arrest warrant," 
said Chief State Attorney Jack 
Kelley. For now, Kelley stops short 
of threatening Moonfacebear with 
criminal prosecution. "I do not deal 
in hypothetical situations," said 
Kelley. 
Moonfacebear could get around 
Connecticut laws on gambling by 
entering into a compact with the 
state. Under the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes and states 
can negotiate gambling operations 
that are otherwise prohibited by 
state law. One problem: the Act 
only applies to federally recognized 
tribes-tribes in official relationships with the U.S. Government. 
The U.S. Government does not recognize the Golden Hill Paugussetts. 
To gain federal recognition and 
its accompanying welfare services, 
groups must prove the historical 
continuity of their tribes. For tribes 
like Golden Hill, such verification 
is prohibitively expensive. "If you've 
got to put up $100,000 to dig up 
everybody's background, I think it's 
kind of foolish," said Chief Piper. 
"They know that we were on reservation land before this country was 
founded and still are on trust land 
today. Now you're going to tell me 
I have to go through all that shit to 
prove we are a continuity?"
