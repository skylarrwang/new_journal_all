Dr. Kathleen Bobef-SorciMII, head of the Westville Residents Association, fears that 
rock concerts, footbal tollgates and World CUp soccer will ruin her netghborhood. 
This summer, the Volvo Tour-
nament ran without a glitch. Few 
parking or traffic problems disrupted 
the surrounding neighborhood. "It

the state legislature to finance the 
construction of a tennis stadium.

Local merchants hoped the Volvo 
tournament would pull in immedi-
ate profits, but were disappointed 
this year. "We did not see the sales 
results we had anticipated," said 
Ann Morrison, marketing and sales 
director for the Chapel Square Mall. 
The week before the tournament, 
the mall sponsored a contest chal-
