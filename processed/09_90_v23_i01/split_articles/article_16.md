pates that the needle exchange will 
show that the demand for treat-
ment is high. "We're hoping this 
will get funds opened up." 
AIDS activists continue to de-
mand that government agencies 
expand treatment facilities. Yale 
Professor Alvin Novick, chairman 
of the Mayor's Task Force on AIDS, 
stresses that drug treatment is an

band-aid to keep people alive until 
we can help them more, " he said.

ers are stocking a health depart-
ment van with clean needles. They 
expect many addicts will meet them 
when they hit the streets later this 
month. "People have been calling 
us for weeks now, " Lugo said. 
"They're asking how they can get 
the needles."
