MUCH ADO ABOUT MUSHROOMS
P O I N T  O F  D E PA R T U R E
 Foraging with the Connecticut Valley Mycological Society

I
t was raining steadily in the woods in Hurd 
State Park, an hour northeast of New Haven. I 
stooped down by the base of a dying tree. There 
wasn’t much to see except for damp leaves carpeting 
the ground. Then I spotted it: a few clusters of small 
tan caps. “Coprinellus micaceus, inky caps,” said 
Beth Karwowski, without missing a beat. Karwowski, 
whose laugh carries through the forest, is the presi-
dent of the Connecticut Valley Mycological Society 
(CVMS). She turned one of the mushrooms upside 
down, revealing its sooty black under-cap. “This is a 
wood-decaying mushroom and can be used to make 
ink,” she explained.

Nearly twenty members of CVMS were crouched 
by rocks or trees throughout the forest. It was a Sun-
day morning and the day of the group’s weekly forage, 
when members come together to search for mush-
rooms and share their interest in mycology, the study 
of fungal life.

CVMS was founded in 1975 by Ed Bosman, who led 
the first foray in Sleeping Giant State Park in Ham-
den, Connecticut. Today, the organization’s Facebook 
group—which anyone interested in Connecticut’s 
mushrooms can join—has over 400 members. But only 
official members who pay the annual fee (fifteen dol-
lars for an individual, twenty dollars for a family) know 
the locations of weekly forays, printed in a blue book. 
“If we gave away the locations, some people would go 
a day before and collect them beforehand,” one mem-
ber warned. Some of the rules are even more strict: 
“YOU ARE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF ANY MUSH-
ROOMS THAT YOU EAT!” is printed in bold at the 
top of the CVMS website and participation waivers.

At the Sunday morning forage, members first met 
at the park pavilion, then disappeared into the woods 
in pairs or by themselves. In spite of the chilly air, the 
pavilion vibrated with the warmth and enthusiasm of 
those looking to share their knowledge with people 
from all levels of foraging experience. Karwowski and 
I continued down the path after finding the inky caps, 
dodging horse dung and rocks slick from the rain. 
“It’s been a very strange year for a lot of reasons,” she 
said, pointing at small white spots on the tree trunks 
surrounding us. “See that white stuff on there? Gypsy 
moth egg.” This past year, gypsy moth caterpillars 
decimated entire forests in Connecticut. Much of the 
destruction affected oak trees, which are dependent on 
the fungi that grow on their roots to live, causing the 
fungi population throughout Connecticut to plum-
met. Paradoxically, however, gypsy moth populations 
are kept in check by another fungus, Entomophaga 
maimaiga, which infects caterpillars with its spores. 
“It rained enough this spring that E. maimaiga was 
able to grow,” Karwowski said. 

As the clock approached noon, people returned to 
the pavilion with wicker baskets and egg cartons full of 
fungi. Thick orangish-white shelf croppings, Laetipo-
rus cincinnatus. Burnt-red, jelly-like, and brain-shaped 
heap, Tremella foliacea. Small round puff balls with 
spiny studdings, Lycoperdon perlatum. “We’ve got 
about twenty or thirty years’ worth of data on forage 
findings,” said Walt Rode, one of CVMS’s expert iden-
tifiers. “We want to make it accessible and reportable 
so that we can see how changes in the environment, 
and climate change, has an effect.” Unlike other for-
aging groups in the region, CVMS not only deals with 
finding edible fungi, but seeks to contribute to scien-
tific research. Members send fungi DNA to laborato-
ries for further study and have even helped to discover 
new species. 

The weekly forages are also social gatherings. 
“When I first joined CVMS, I thought, ‘who needs a 
group?’” laughed Connie Borodenko, another expert 
identifier. She sported a well-worn mushroom iden-
tification guide T-shirt under her bright orange rain 
jacket. “But this group is so full of scientific minds, 
I began to learn so much more quickly.” Boroden-
ko’s grandmother from Poland first taught her family 
mushrooming; Borodenko spent twenty years search-
ing on her own before she found CVMS. “I used to 
be shy and withdrawn too,” she said, “but the group 
brought me out of my shell.” 

“It’s the best feeling when you come onto some-
thing wonderful in the company of somebody else who 
thinks it’s wonderful. Often those fungi are edible…
but even the unusual little fungi [are wonderful],” 
added Jean Hopkins, one of Borodenko’s friends. Peo-
ple in CVMS hail from all sorts of backgrounds, none 
of which involve mycology. Before retiring, Boro-
denko was an art teacher and building mechanic at a 
phone company. Rode has worked as a librarian com-
puter specialist for twenty-five years. Karwowski works 
in finance. Other people came as couples or tagged 
along with family members, united by a common curi-
osity for mushrooms and the fungal world. 

“Food, medicine, dye material, taxonomy and sys-
tematics, biological and ecological; there are lots of 
different ways that people become interested in mush-
rooms, but we try to add more to that too,” said Bill 
Yule, education director for CVMS. “But mostly we’re 
here for fun, and food,” he laughed.

Today’s forage wasn’t just any outing––it was the 
“Tailgate Forage,” the last major one of the year, com-
plete with a potluck of homemade mushroom dishes. 
As I waited in line for a helping of hen-of-the-woods 
soup, someone offered me a taste of freshly sautéed 
Coprinus comatus. I took a bite; the scaly white mush-
rooms were buttery, with a subtle, earthy undertone. 
Raincoats hung from the ceiling near the fireplaces, 
and people huddled at the pavilion tables, admiring 
their finds or simply laughing and telling stories. 
“It’s a religious experience,” Hopkins winked. “But 
don’t write that down.”
