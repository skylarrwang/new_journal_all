A fragile sanctuary

Marco Antonio Reyes Alvarez’s bags were almost 
packed. He had his ticket for a flight the next 
morning, August 8, to Ecuador, the country he 
left twenty years ago for the United States. At his home in 
Meriden—a small city midway between Hartford and New 
Haven—Fanny Torres Reyes, his wife of twenty-four years, 
their three children, and thirty relatives had gathered for his 
final hours in the country. His deportation loomed on the 
other side of the night.
“We were saying goodbye, crying, making his suitcases,” 
Torres Reyes remembered. She is forty years old, slight, with 
expressive eyes and dark brown hair that falls just below her 
shoulders. “He was even [packing] some tools to bring over 
there so he would be able to work.”

It would be a two-hour drive to the airport in New York 
City, a six-and-a-half-hour flight to Ecuador, and a decade 
before he could begin to petition the United States gov-
ernment for re-entry. That process alone could take up to 
five years. By then, his twelve-year-old daughter, Adriana, 
an American citizen, could sponsor her father’s request for 
readmission. Or maybe one of their other children—twen-
ty-three-year old Evelyn and twenty-one-year-old Anthony, 
both DACA recipients—would have gained legal status 
through marriage and could vouch for him. But he would 
still need to apply for a waiver of his removal order. It could 
be well over a decade before Reyes Alvarez saw his family 
again, or perhaps he would never be able to return.
“Muy, muy, muy, muy duro,” Reyes Alvarez said with a 
heavy sigh, remembering that night. “You had to say good-
bye to your son, your wife…”

Forty-five years old, Reyes Alvarez has a compact build, 
a soft, square face, and dark hair trimmed close to his head. 
He has a quiet gentleness that belies his steadfast resolve. 
In 1997, he made the two-week trek from Ecuador to Texas, 
sometimes walking for days on end, in search of better pros-
pects for his family. He settled in Connecticut and estab-
lished himself as a construction worker skilled in everything 
from sheetrock and drywall to carpentry and framing. His 
young family soon joined him. For the next twenty years, he 
was their sole provider.

PROTECT MARCO ANTONIO REYES 
ALVAREZ FROM DEPORTATION. NO ONE 
KNOWS FOR HOW LONG.

Now, years of fighting a deportation order dating back to 
2009 would end at dawn. The week before his deportation 
date, Erin O’Neil-Baker, his Hartford-based attorney, had 
filed a motion to reopen his case with the Board of Immi-
gration Appeals on the grounds of asylum. If Reyes Alvarez 
returned to Ecuador, O’Neil-Baker said, he would be in 
certain danger. His brother-in-law had recently been mur-
dered there by a suspect who, after a brief prison sentence, 
was now free and threatening other members of the Reyes 
family.

For the past two years, Reyes Alvarez’s requests for stays 
of removal had been granted, extending his legal ability to 
remain in the country. Each request involved demonstrat-
ing that he had no criminal record, was employed, and paid 
taxes. But on June 27, 2017, for the first time, his request 
was denied. His situation is characteristic of a new trend 
in immigration court proceedings that began soon after the 
inauguration of President Donald Trump.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is 
“now targeting people with old removal orders, not people 
with criminal records,” O’Neil-Baker said. “They’re seen as 
low-hanging fruit.”

In Meriden, Reyes Alvarez’s family cried and prayed as 
they packed his bags. Late in the evening, friends and mem-
bers of Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA), a New Haven-based 
immigrants’ rights group, arrived and they all gathered in 
the dining room, Torres Reyes remembered. They reminded 
Reyes Alvarez that there was a last option: he could take 
sanctuary in a local church. 

If he did, he would join a growing number of undocu-
mented immigrants across the country who have sought ref-
uge from deportation in places of worship, continuing to 
fight their cases from spare rooms and basements. 
Since 2011, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has 
recognized schools, hospitals, and places of worship as “sen-
sitive locations”—only in exceptional circumstances, such 
as public security threats, would ICE agents enter the prem-
ises to question or detain a suspect. The Obama-era policy 
was adopted to ensure that agents “exercise sound judge-
ment when enforcing federal law” and “avoid unnecessarily 
alarming local communities,” according to ICE. 
In 2015 and 2016 combined, there were eight public cases 
of undocumented immigrants taking sanctuary from depor-
tation in places of worship. Since January of this year, there 
have been thirty.

In late July, Nury Chavarria, a mother of four from Nor-
walk, won an emergency stay of removal less than a week 
after taking sanctuary in a Fair Haven church. Her case was 
far from resolved, but it offered a sense of hope to undocu-
mented immigrants in Connecticut facing their own depor-
tation dates.

Still, if Reyes Alvarez took sanctuary, there would be no 
guarantee of a legal victory. He might have to live for weeks, 
months or years in a single space, awaiting a final immi-
gration decision. But late that night, he decided that it was 
a risk worth taking. “Seeing his kids crying—and also me, 
because I couldn’t stop crying—we decided, last minute, 
that he would take the last resort,” Torres Reyes said.

By 11 p.m. that night, Jesus Morales Sanchez, an orga-
nizer for ULA, had spent the last two hours in New 
Haven writing a press release for Reyes Alvarez’ 
departure. Suddenly, John Jairo Lugo, the head of ULA, 
who had been at Reyes Alvarez’s home that night, called 
him with the news that Reyes Alvarez had decided to stay. 
There was no sanctuary waiting to take him in, so a 
network of communication sprang into action. Jairo Lugo 
called Paul Fleck, the pastor of the Hamden Plains United 
Methodist Church and an organizer of the Sanctuary Move-
ment in the New Haven area. Fleck has spent the past year 
helping a handful of religious communities prepare to 
host someone seeking refuge from deportation. But he had 
already gone to sleep by the time Reyes Alvarez made his 
decision, so didn’t see Jairo Lugo’s message until he woke 
up unexpectedly at 2 a.m.

Thirty-five miles away, in Wethersfield, a suburb of Hart-
ford, Juhye Hahn had just crept into bed after a long night 
of work when her phone pinged from another room.
“When you hear that message sound that early in the 
morning, you have to check if something is wrong,” Hahn 
said. “The message came from Paul: someone needed sanc-
tuary. So I said, ‘I’ll be there.’”

Hahn had only been the pastor of the First and Summer-
field United Methodist Church in New Haven for a month. 
The towering red-brick church on the corner of Elm and 
College Streets has a history of social justice, but this past 
year, its activist mission took on a new sense of urgency.

In February, then-pastor Thomas Kim delivered a ser-
mon rebuking President Trump’s executive order banning 
travel from seven majority-Muslim countries. He encour-
aged his congregation to put their progressive principles 
into practice. “I strongly felt that I was called to preach that 
becoming a sanctuary church is one of the ways that we can 
be [the] salt and light of the world,” he wrote in an email, 
referring to a passage from the Gospel of Matthew. “And 
the members of FSUMC agreed with me.” That spring, 
“ICE is now targeting 
people with old removal 
orders, not people with 
criminal records. They're 
seen as low-hanging fruit.”
