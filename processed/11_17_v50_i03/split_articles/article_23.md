July, she didn’t want to stand behind the altar because she 
felt disconnected from her parishioners. For a few weeks, 
she used a black metal music stand, since the church didn’t 
have the funds to buy a portable lectern. Reyes Alvarez has 
already spent many hours working on projects around the 
church—fixing shelves in the kitchen, repainting the wain-
scoting in the dining hall—and when he heard that Hahn 
was looking for a new lectern, he offered to help.


The hardest part of building the lectern was getting the 
materials, Torres Reyes said. She had to track down all her 
husband’s tools in their home and her brother’s backyard 
shed. Then there was the two-hour trip to Home Depot, 
video-calling him in the middle of the aisle to show him all 
the possible wood grains and stains.


“He was the one who always [went] to that place, so I 
would show him, ‘This one or this one?’” Torres Reyes said, 
laughing. “And he would say, ‘Yes, this one,’ ‘No, no, no, 
bring that one!’”


Eventually they settled on oak, because Reyes Alvarez 
wanted to build something that would last. Torres Reyes had 
the wood cut and brought it back to the church. Reyes Alva-
“At the beginning, we 
thought we were doing 
something for him.  But 
actually, he is the 
blessing for us.”
rez set up carpentry horses in the basement, brought down 
his tools and an air compressor, and got to work. It took 
only two days, he said, but he had to wait another week for 
the wood stain to dry because the basement was so humid. 
On a Sunday in October, they presented the lectern to the 
congregation.


“It’s not just a lectern,” Hahn said. “I mean, I’m happy to 
have that lectern, but for me personally, it’s a witness. God 
answered the prayer that I had in a mysterious way.” She 
pauses to reflect. “At the beginning, we thought we were 
doing something for him.  But actually, he is the blessing 
for us.”


For the foreseeable future, Reyes Alvarez will continue 
living in First and Summerfield, waiting to hear if his peti-
tion for asylum is granted and greeting the visitors who stop 
by every now and then. When the side door opens, snatches 
of sound from the city street drift down the hall to his room. 
From time to time, he’ll step onto the patio for a little air, 
though it’s getting cold now. On Sundays, he’ll attend the 
church service and the coffee hour afterwards. And when 
he can, he will retreat to the basement to work on his next 
project, a wooden baptismal font in which to display the 
church’s bare silver bowl. It will be modest but solid, he 
says. A simple thing of beauty, built with the hope that it 
will remain in the sanctuary far longer than its creator.
