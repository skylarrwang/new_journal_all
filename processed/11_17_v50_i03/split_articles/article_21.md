the members of the church council voted unanimously to 
become a sanctuary church, one of the first in Connecticut. 

In the past year, the Sanctuary Movement has taken on 
a new sense of urgency as the Trump Administration cracks 
down on undocumented immigrants, said Rev. Noel Ander-
sen, the national grassroots coordinator of the Church World 
Service (CWS), a humanitarian aid organization. Although 
the tradition of taking sanctuary has ancient origins, the 
practice became a full-fledged movement in the United 
States in the 1980s, when churches began providing shelter 
for those fleeing violence in Central America, whom the 
U.S. did not recognize as asylum-seekers. CWS has become 
the “connective tissue” of the Sanctuary Movement, Ander-
sen said, coordinating networks of faith communities across 
the country. Although sanctuary churches tend to be “pro-
gressive-leaning,” he said, they cut across a broad spectrum 
of denominations.

For Hahn, agreeing to host Reyes Alvarez was a natu-
ral extension of her religious conviction. “When Jesus fed 
the hungry, I don’t think Jesus asked, ‘Do you have proper 
I.D.?’” she said. “Jesus just fed people, because he saw the 
need. For me, it’s the same thing.”

Although many of the churches in the New York Confer-
ence of the United Methodist Church—450 congregations 
scattered across Long Island, New York City, and half of 
Connecticut—have become sanctuaries in the past year, 
First and Summerfield is the first to actually host someone. 
As of November, two other churches in the New Haven area 
had taken in sanctuary seekers: Iglesia De Dios Pentecostal 
in Fair Haven, which hosted Chavarria, and the Unitarian 
Universalist Church in Meriden, which is still hosting six-
ty-eight-year-old Sujitno Sajuti, who faces deportation to 
Indonesia.

There are logistical concerns involved in becoming a 
long-term sanctuary, Fleck says: the building needs to have 
a kitchen, shower, and makeshift bedroom. But more impor-
tantly, a congregation must take the “considerable leap of 
faith” involved in hosting someone, essentially committing 
to a massive, protracted advocacy effort and the politiciza-
tion of its spiritual mission.

After she replied to Fleck’s text, Hahn went back to bed, 
but couldn’t fall asleep. Eventually, she got up, showered, 
and began driving toward New Haven in the pale early 
morning light. She didn’t know anything about Reyes Alva-
rez, but was heartbroken for him and prepared to give him 
the protection he needed.

In their homes in Hamden, Wanda Harris and Adeline 
Tucker, longtime parishioners of First and Summerfield 
and members of the church’s social concerns committee, 
had also received early morning messages from Fleck. They 
arrived at the church at 6 a.m., joining a small group includ-
ing Hahn and Fleck waiting for Reyes Alvarez to arrive. All 
at once, he and his wife entered through the church’s side 
door on College Street.

“It was intense, it was hurried and rushed,” Fleck said. 
“We situated him and let him know where everything was.”

Harris and Tucker showed Reyes Alvarez around the laby-
rinthine building. In the basement was the dining hall with 
its bright, white-tiled floor and windows just below street 
level. On the second floor were the offices of the three Yale 
unions, Locals 33, 34, and 35. On the first floor was the main 
sanctuary, a large, square room with a gleaming, circular 
hardwood floor at its center; a soaring, dark-paneled altar-
piece; and tall, green stained-glass panels running along two 
opposing walls.

Just past Hahn’s office, at the end of a dim, blue-walled 
corridor, was the maroon-carpeted meeting room that 
would be now be Reyes Alvarez’s bedroom. It was still clut-
tered with church furniture, which they began to remove 
and rearrange. There was no bed yet; Fleck would bring 
one that afternoon. As Reyes Alvarez began to get settled, 
his immediate family arrived, followed by the thirty relatives 
who had come to see him off the night before.

“It was really hard to see the family,” Hahn said. “I could 
tell they cried all night, because their eyes were red. They 
were shaken, not knowing what would happen.”

By 11 a.m., however, Reyes Alvarez was standing resolute 
behind the iron fence at the top of the stairs to the church’s 
main entrance, flanked by his family, Senator Richard Blu-
menthal, Mayor Toni Harp, church leaders, and ULA orga-
nizers, as he addressed a crowd of supporters.

“We came to this country with a lot of dreams and it is 
very difficult to be going through what we are going through 
now,” Reyes Alvarez said, as his son-in-law Brian Martinez 
translated. “Here I am, here is my family, here is my com-
munity, and here are all of us who want to live in a better 
world.”


Fanny Torres Reyes enters her husband’s room and sits 
down at the wooden table next to him. It’s a Monday 
afternoon and Reyes Alvarez has been living at First 
and Summerfield for the past seven weeks. Even in the soft 
light from the chandelier overhead, the strain of their ordeal 
shows in their faces.

With Reyes Alvarez in sanctuary and unable to work, the 
family has been working hard to make ends meet. Torres 
Reyes started housecleaning. Their son Anthony works long 
days in construction in a nearby town. Their oldest daughter 
Evelyn, who is studying dental hygiene at Gateway Com-
munity College in New Haven, works at a deli, and she and 
her husband have moved back in with Torres Reyes. When 
Reyes Alvarez entered First and Summerfield, the family 
set up an online donation page that, by October, had raised 
about $3,000 of their $10,000 goal.

The room’s only windows overlook the light brick wall 
of a Yale School of Music building; there’s rarely any direct 
sunlight. But Reyes Alvarez and his family have made an 
effort to make the room feel cozy. There’s a colorful throw 
folded neatly on a brown couch on one side of the room; 
cards and flowers line the windowsill. A single bed nestled 
into a corner of the room almost looks like it was meant to 
be there. Reyes Alvarez’s heavy-duty toolboxes are stacked 
one on top of the other, next to his Shop-Vac, at the end 
of his bed. Along one wall, there’s a bookshelf lined with 
identical copies of prayer books, a ceramic water jug and a 
large stack of packaged food.

Reyes Alvarez peels open a package of pecan Sandies and 
offers one to his wife.

“It was a busy day today,” Torres Reyes says with a weary 
smile, her dark hair pulled back from her face in a high bun.

That morning, she had brought their twelve-year-old 
daughter Adriana to join a protest of nearly two hundred 
people at the federal immigration court in Hartford against 
the imminent deportation of Franklin and Gioconda 
Ramos. Like Torres Reyes and Reyes Alvarez, the Ramos 
couple is from Ecuador and live in Meriden. Thirty-six pro-
testers, including Fleck, the pastor of the Hamden Plains 
UMC, sat in a line in front of the court doors, barring entry; 
they were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing.

Usually Adriana comes with her mother to First and 
Summerfield, but today, tired from the early protest and 
afterschool soccer, her mother left her home to rest. Hours 
later, the memory of that morning’s protest, and the Ramos 
family, seemed to weigh heavily on Torres Reyes.

“We’re from the same country,” she said in a wavering 
voice, looking down at her hands folded in her lap. “So it’s 
very hard.”

Reyes Alvarez’s day starts and ends with a small task: 
switching out the rechargeable battery of his GPS tracker, 
which ICE officials clamped onto his right ankle in July. 
It’s a black plastic bracelet that sends data about his loca-
tion to a private company in Hartford subcontracted by ICE 
to monitor undocumented immigrants with deportation 
orders. He has to change the battery every eight hours. If 
he were to step outside the church, ICE would know imme-
diately.

“He feels like a slave,” Torres Reyes said. “It’s very uncom-
fortable. I think he got used to it in some way—resignation 
that he has to wear it for a while. At the beginning, he was 
very upset that he had to wear it.”

“I'm most scared because I 
don't have any answer for 
my kids if I have to go back to 
my country. I don't want to
separate my family.”

Three months into 
his stay at First and 
Summerfield UMC, 
for Reyes Alvarez, 
life is uneasy and 
claustrophobic.

Reyes Alvarez has about eight visitors every day, he says. 
ULA organizer Jesus Morales Sanchez is usually with him 
every weekday, relatives visit on the weekends. His youngest 
daughter Adriana comes most days after school. Evelyn vis-
its after classes at Gateway, Anthony on the weekends when 
he’s off work. Some visitors are ULA members who have 
made it a habit to drop by to see him. Others are complete 
strangers who have heard about his case and want to offer 
their support. To each of them, Reyes Alvarez offers a seat 
on the couch or around the small wooden table at the cen-
ter of his room.

Within the church building, Reyes Alvarez can use most 
rooms when he wants to, but he usually goes back and 
forth between his room and the downstairs dining hall. In 
the bathroom down the hall from his room, he installed a 
shower himself, equipped with a stainless-steel handle. His 
only opportunity for a breath of fresh air is the church’s 
handicap-accessible entrance, a small garden patio enclosed 
by a metal fence. He usually just stays inside, although one 
of their friends always encourages him to go feel the sun-
light. “I try,” Reyes Alvarez says wearily.

Torres Reyes brings her husband food from home or 
cooks in the basement kitchen. Sometimes Reyes Alvarez 
cooks, too. His specialty? White rice.

“It never comes out as good when I make it. He puts 
something special in it,” Torres Reyes says, laughing.

“It’s a secret!” Reyes Alvarez responds with a chuckle.

If no one is visiting, he cooks in the kitchen downstairs, 
does push-ups, or listens to Bob Marley. In his room, there’s 
an old television set and a stack of dramas on VCR, although 
if Reyes Alvarez ever watches something, it’s usually Netflix 
Christian movies on a desktop in the corner of the room.

Back in Ecuador, he played on a travel soccer team and 
follows his favorite team, Barcelona, with intensity. But he’s 
missing out on the games that matter the most: Adriana’s. 
“It’s hard because I like soccer, I want to see my daughter…
oh my God,” he says, his voice breaking.

Reyes Alvarez met Torres Reyes when he was sixteen years 
old; they both grew up in Mera, a small town in central 
Ecuador, in the foothills of the Andes. In 1997, when their 
oldest children were toddlers, Reyes Alvarez paid smugglers 
known as coyotajes seven thousand dollars to make the two-
week journey to the United States border. He and forty oth-
ers were driven from Ecuador to Mexico, then walked to 
Texas. A bus and a train later, he was arrived in New Haven, 
where Torres Reyes’ brother had already settled. In 2000, 
after he became established in the area, his wife joined him. 
A year later, they had enough money to rent a bigger apart-
ment in Wallingford, and their children came too. Five 
years later, they moved to Meriden, and other relatives soon 
followed suit, settling in the area.

In 2007, on a family trip to Michigan, the family’s GPS 
took them off course and they accidentally drove across the 
border into Canada. Reyes Alvarez was detained for a week-
end until his family posted bail. The incident identified him 
to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which lead 
to him being placed in removal proceedings, his attorney 
O’Neil-Baker said. Two years later, he received a removal 
order. Over the following years, repeated attempts to reopen 
his case were denied.

Torres Reyes tries to come to First and Summerfield every 
day and often stays the night so that her husband won’t be 
alone. When she’s not there, he sometimes can’t sleep or 
won’t eat, she says. Although he has adopted a daily rhythm, 
there is no getting used to life in purgatory. 

“I’m most scared because I don’t have any answer for my 
kids if I have to go back to my country,” he said. “I don’t 
want to separate my family.”
