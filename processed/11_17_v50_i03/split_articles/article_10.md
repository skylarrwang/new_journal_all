EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
prayer rooms, the bathrooms and the ablution rooms 
where worshippers may wash their feet, the empty tiled 
dining room that will be full of dishes and tables and 
hungry congregants when construction is completed. 

Upstairs are open, well-lit classrooms where children 
learn how to speak Turkish and how to cook, how to 
read the Quran and how to pray. In one, the children 
have written their names on rounded blue rectangles 
pasted to the wall below a peaked border of tiny Turk-
ish flags. A red balloon printed with the flag’s white 
crescent and star hangs in the middle of the room like 
a chandelier.

On the third floor, right below the dome, all is 
ragged and metal. It looks like we’re standing inside 
a malformed egg. Elevli explains 
how busy her husband is, waking up 
at four every morning, running his 
restaurant in Wallingford, mediating 
between the Turkish government 
and the city about the mosque’s 
construction, not always returning 
home at night. “All for Allah,” she 
tells me, “all for Allah.” She explains 
that she too works for Allah.

“M
y 
community,” 
Gökçek says, “is the 
secular people. Not 
the religious people.” I ask him if 
he erected his statue and collected 
his signatures to protest the mosque. 
“No,” he says, “Not to protest.” Only 
to affirm secular Turkey. Only to 
send a message overseas to Erdoğan.

Though he did tell the New Haven 
Independent that the congregants 
have “religion brain,”  which, he 
said, is “worse than drugs.” And that he imagined them 
“screaming every day” at his statue. He did tell me that 
“religion [is] more dangerous than cocaine, heroin.” I 
ask Elevli how her community feels about Mr. Gökçek 
and his yard.“ I don’t like talking about him,” she says. 
The sun glints off Bronze Atatürk and the mosque’s 
golden crescents. The worshippers arrive to pray and 
Gökçek refills his vases of red and white carnations.

Increased student interest helps formalize 
American Sign Language courses at Yale**

O
n a recent Wednesday evening in a basement 
room of Yale University’s Dow Hall, four stu-
dents attempted a translation of the song “I’ll 
Make a Man out of You,” from Disney’s Mulan. Hands, 
fingers, and arms jumped, fluttered, and glided their 
way through the lyrics. The class broke into a fit of gig-
gles when the professor, Jessica Tanner, forced them 
to re-sign the line, “Tranquil as the forest but on fire 
within.” Their signs for “fire,” she suggested, had been 
underwhelming. Her hands, fingers, and eyebrows flew 
vigorously upward from her chest and out into a shower 
of sparks as she demonstrated the proper gesture. It 
couldn’t have looked more fiery had she flicked open 
a Zippo.


Right now, Yale students can only study American 
Sign Language (ASL) through small not-for-credit 
classes offered through Yale’s Directed Independent 
Language Study (DILS) program. Tanner’s ASL group 
has been one of most popular DILS programs since 
it began in 2010. In recent years, she’s had to turn 
away prospective signers due to the program’s limited 
resources. But come spring, with expanded resources 
and administrative support, the university will offer two 
full-fledged, five-days-a-week ASL classes through the 
Linguistics Department, which petitioned the Lan-
guage Study Committee last spring for the course’s 
approval.


Raffaella Zanuttini, the Director of Undergraduate 
Studies for the Linguistics  department and author of 
the proposal, says it’s no surprise that it has taken Yale 
so long to create a formal ASL class. Universities have 
been slow across the board: although the University of 
Rochester became the first college in the country to 
offer ASL as a foreign language in the 1990s, ASL has 
been around much longer. It’s taken two hundred years 
for ASL to float down to New Haven from just up the 
Connecticut River Valley in Hartford, Connecticut, 
where in 1817 a Yale graduate, with advice from then-
Yale president Timothy Dwight IV, founded the Amer-
ican School for the Deaf (ASD). The children who 
came to ASD brought with them their home and local 
sign languages, which combined with the university’s 
French Sign Language to create ASL. 


The path to Yale’s first-ever ASL course had enough 
hurdles to be a track event. It required coordination 
between the DILS program, the Linguistics depart-
ment, the Yale College Council, and the Dean’s 
Office. Last spring, Kate Rosenberg, a senior Linguis-
tics major and recent founder of the ASL at Yale club, 
approached Zanuttini about adding an ASL option to 
the Blue Book. Zanuttini soon discovered that there 
was also strong faculty interest in ASL, a YCC task force 
report showing high demand for ASL instruction, and a 
beloved instructor—Jessica Tanner—already teaching 
ASL at Yale. “It was quite a discovery,” she recounted. 
Zanuttini submitted a report to the Language Study 
Committee, the panel that oversees Yale’s foreign lan-
guage offerings, which gave the program two thumbs 
up this past summer. The pilot program will begin 
this spring, and Jessica Tanner will move from DILS 


to a lecturer in the Linguistics department, 
teaching introductory and intermediate 
level courses. Students say they have every 
reason to believe her classes will make Yale 
a more positive and welcoming place for 
people with disabilities.


For Rosenberg, learning ASL has given 
her an opportunity to access and commu-
nicate with a rich culture that many peo-
ple do not know exists. “A lot of people 
distinguish between little-d deaf and big-D 
Deaf,” she said. “Little-d deaf means that 
someone cannot hear; big-D Deaf is where 
you’re Deaf and proud of it, and you inter-
act with the community and use signing 
as your main method of communication.” 
Tanner, who is Deaf, embeds this sort of 
cultural education in her classroom, as any 
other foreign language instructor would.


Benjamin Nodalsky, who led the YCC 
Disabilities Task Force last year, hopes that 
the ASL program will improve awareness of 
Deaf culture at Yale. “By introducing ASL, 
we’re clearing the way for more people 
with links to Deaf culture to come here,” 
he said.   


Zanutinni hopes the course will dis-
pel pernicious misconceptions about sign 
languages in general: “Things that we 
mark through intonation, for example, 
are marked through facial expression,” she 
said. “They really are languages with the 
same level of systematicity and richness of 
expression and creativity…It’s not just pan-
tomime, and the signs aren’t just spellings 
of the words in spoken language.” 


From the vantage of Tanner’s DILS 
classroom, the work of inclusion looks 
like four students practicing their Mulan 
translation. On their lyrics sheets, “Let’s 
get down to business to defeat the Huns” 
is transcribed as “HUNS, COMING, 
HURRY, BECOME, SOLDIERS,” which 
they sign in time with the music playing 
from a laptop. One student signs out of 
time with the others, and everyone cracks 
up. As the students’ hands leap around to 
debrief before rehearsing again, the class-
room is silent, but not at all quiet.
