and washing his hands and then explaining to his chil-
dren in measured tones that the yearling whose throat 
he had just slit had already been bloody and mangled 
and gasping and dying. Telling us it was happier now 
that it was dead.

My father is not a violent man by nature. None of 
this came naturally. He loves dogs and sheep, and he 
could never kill either of them without regretting the 
need for it afterwards. His first and favorite dog, a bea-
gle named Rupert, was exactly the sort of unruly ani-
mal who would terrorize sheep if given a chance. Years 
later, when he became a buddhist and started to begin 
each dinner with a prayer for the happiness of all sen-
tient beings, he regretted shooting dogs even more. But 
if he is a poor buddhist when he runs upstairs for the 
gun, he is also a good shepherd.


O
ver the years, my father has shot four more dogs. 
The most recent one was a yellow and brown 
Labrador mix named George, who broke into 
our sheep twice with his brother Fred. There will not 
be another. Now, there are hardly any sheep left for 
them to chase. My mother gave up sheepdog trials years 
ago and began teaching philosophy at a small college. 
Vic, Lark, and Bonnie—the dogs she once brought to 
trials —are all buried beside the pond, and the current 
generation of Collies is beginning to grow gray. So are 
my parents. They are both in their 50s: a fine age for 
teaching philosophy and for counting breaths, but an 
unwieldy one for maintaining a farm. That is part of 
the reason why, this past summer, they sold all but our 
three oldest sheep, and why they hope to sell the fields 
those three will die on within a year. The other part, 
which my mother confided to me only a few days ago, 
is that she can no longer bear to be a shepherd. 

She can no longer bear to help a ram lamb take its 
first steps and nurse, knowing that after six months of 
sunny green pastures she will send it to the butcher. 
She could no longer bear to eat lamb five years ago: 
that was when she began feeding it to the dogs, sell-
ing it to friends, or if she served it to us, not eating it 
herself. But soon that will all be behind her, for the 
lambs are gone, the farm will soon go, and my parents 
have just made an offer on a little green house in New 
Haven. And perhaps here, in the city, eating lamb will 
be easier. 

In a city, it is so easy to buy lamb stuffed into lifeless 
packages from sterile counters—packages that do not 
bleat, that do not remind you of living creatures racing 
across spring meadows: packages that were prepared by 
others. In a city, perhaps my father will finally be able 
to make the Prātimokṣa oath of nonviolence that he 
could never commit to on the farm. Here, no sheep 
will die because of that oath, and so keeping it will be 
easy. Many things will be easier in a city. And maybe 
that is why, since I have lost the sheep and the fields, I 
feel that I must keep the skull. I will set it on a shelf in 
my dorm, and there it will remind me of what it meant 
to live on a farm.
