e found the skull in a field by the creek. 
We were young then, my sister and I, young 
enough that an old sheep’s skeleton, still 
mostly preserved, still unravaged by dogs, was no more 
than a curiosity, and the heavy skull, still greasy, still 
smelling strongly of brains, was a trophy waiting to 
be brought back and presented to our mother. She 
accepted it, washed it, and finally decided to display it 
on a shelf in the basement. She cherished most of our 
macabre prizes—the fox skeleton, the crow skull, the 
hardened bird nests and torn snake skins—but, more 
than a decade later, she told me that she was never 
fond of those which came from sheep. She discreetly 
returned almost all of these to the fields. “In some 
sense,” she explained, “they were a testimony to my 
inevitable failure as a shepherd to keep things from 
dying.” 

My family came to the farm sixteen years ago. My 
mother competed actively in sheepdog trials in those 
days, and she had grown tired of training her dogs on 
other people’s sheep. And so, when I was a little over 
four, my parents sold their tiny apartment in west Palo 
Alto for an improbable sum and bought fifty-three acres 
in rural Maryland, which they then populated with 
a flock of about fifty sheep. I have no recollection of 
Palo Alto—for me, it is a city that lives only in mantel 
pictures. My earliest memories are of wading through 
weedy meadows down by the creek, of sculpting clay 
with my sister on the banks, of wondering what it would 
be like to get lost in the woods, of staring at mistrustful 
ewes that always kept me thirty paces away from their 
lambs. It was in these years that our basement became 
a repository for dead animals: we accumulated several 
shelves full of their remains. For much of my child-
hood these bones watched over me while I played with 
blocks in the basement, and I expect that most of them 
will never leave the farm. One familiar bone, though, 
left about a month ago, and now it resides in a strange 
country without fields, creeks, or sheep. It sits on the 
table before me in my dorm in New Haven. It is the 
only part of the farm that I have carried with me into 
the city.

The skull is old now. There are cracks running 
through it, down the middle and along the sides, and 
in many places the bone is fraying—where the outer 
surface has worn away, the honeycombed interior 
resembles a desiccated coral. The deterioration is 
worst around the nose: there, the bone has thinned to 
a paper’s width, and it has fractured so jaggedly that 
if I run my finger along the edge, I fear that I will be 
cut. Amidst my never-living books and papers, the skull 
seems out of place. It has never heard traffic before or 
been much inclined to religion, but in the city a thou-
sand cars pass by it every hour, and every hour it is 
startled by the sound of church bells. My dorm’s single 
window gives it a slanted view of Temple Street, but

the scene beyond the glass never changes. It watches 
people hurrying past, pushing each other aside, check-
ing their watches: moving with urban urgency. And it 
never sees any sheep.

My family has had this skull for nearly fifteen years. 
By now it has lost most of its weight—has become 
lighter than a newborn lamb—and has also lost its 
smell. Or rather, it has lost its original, unmistakable 
smell. What it has retained is faint, subtle, and inde-
scribable. It does not smell like hay, but it reminds me 
of springtime lambs nursing in a hay-stocked barn; it 
does not smell like grass, but it reminds me of yearlings 
grazing on a summer paddock; it does not smell like 
wool, but it reminds me of old ewes huddling under 
their fleeces in an autumnal frost; it no longer smells 
like carrion, but it reminds me of a childhood January 
when I saw vultures arcing lazy spirals over a snowy 
field. It does not smell like sheep, but it reminds me 
of sheep in a way that the skull’s hollow eyes, fractured 
nose, and jawless grin never could. 

S
ometime in early March of every year I can 
remember on the farm, I have woken to hear 
bleating from the season’s first lambs echoing 
down from the barn. On the matted hay and between 
the small blue stalls, the lambs come out covered with 
placenta. They are ugly at first, and wobbly, and as tired 
from labor as their mothers. Yet they stand and nurse 
within an hour, and they are steady within a day, and 
within a few weeks they are on the wide green fields, 
crying petulantly and incessantly for milk, tumbling 
and jumping in their little lamb races over the hills. 
This was the single season when we children were reg-
ularly conscripted to farm work. It is by spring that I 
best remember the farm, and it is by the lambs that I 
best remember the sheep. 

The Border Collies, on the other hand, have never 
been fond of lambs. A sheepdog is accustomed to a cer-
tain respect from livestock, and most ewes, remember-
ing the dog’s ancestors, grudgingly give it to them. But 
a month-old lamb, too young to remember anything, 
will sometimes approach a Collie, sniff its nose, and 
seem to ask whether the dog would like to be its friend. 
This spectacle is almost as traumatizing for the dog—
who would like nothing better than to eat the insane 
lamb but knows it is not allowed to do so—as it is for 
the lamb’s horrified mother. Collies prefer carrion, 
which for them is not only a delicacy, but also a per-
fume even more captivating than feces. Sheepdogs who 
have beautified themselves with such perfumes are, as 
one might imagine, best admired from afar. But if one 
admires them from the proper distance, if one watches 
as they circle around a flock, as they creep up slowly 
on it, ready to dart left or right, their unblinking eyes 
steady and fixated, dominating the sheep through sheer 
will, their tail down, neither wagging nor tucked, their 
deliberate paws silently treading the ground, slowly 
closing the distance…from that vantage, my mother’s 
dogs are nothing less than beautiful.  

hen our sheep have had to run from neigh-
bors’ dogs, they have almost always chosen 
to run downhill, and that always leads them 
into water. There is some safety in this habit—it’s 
harder for the dogs to get a grip on the sheep while 
they are swimming—but sometimes they reach the 
water too late. And so it was that, about ten years ago, 
a year-old ewe jumped into our little pond and two 
black-and-white German Shepherds jumped in after 
her. I was only ten. What I remember is a frenzy of 
unfamiliar barking from the yard and a commotion in 
the kitchen and my mother shouting to my father and 
my father running upstairs and coming down with the 
long black rifle and then the sound of gunshots and an 
end to the sound of barking. Silence. My father coming 
back into the kitchen and returning to the fields with a 
knife. More silence. Silent minutes pooling like sum-
mer molasses. Then finally my mother storming back 
into the house furious at the woman who had let her 
dogs get into our sheep and my father following her
