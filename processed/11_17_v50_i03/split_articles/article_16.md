opioid epidemic,” Dr. Fiellin said. 

The crisis extends well beyond needles and heroin. 

Many people get hooked on prescription painkillers 
after undergoing surgery or getting wisdom teeth 
removed. Some do not know they are addicted until 
it is too late. Opioid use disorder “doesn’t stay away 
from smart and talented people,” Dr. Fiellin said.
Opioid use is claiming the lives of tens of thou-
sands of people around the country, including New 
Haven and the rest of Connecticut. According to 
the CDC, on average, 142 people die from a drug 
overdose per day in the U.S., and at least ninety of 
those deaths are caused by opioid use. In Connecti-
cut alone, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 
projects 1,078 drug overdose deaths in 2017, which 
is more than a 15 percent increase from last year. 
The risk of a Yalie overdosing is greater now than 
ever. Lindsey Rogers, a student at the Yale School of 
Public Health who is studying the opioid epidemic, 
said she is “one thousand percent sure” that, given 
the extent of the crisis, there will be an opioid-related 
death on Yale’s campus in the next five to ten years. 

L
ast year, Jeff came close.  Jeff, who is a current 
Yale student but was not enrolled at the time 
of the incident, does not fit the profile of a ste-
reotypical heroin addict. Jeff (a pseudonym used to 
protect his identity) is smart. He wears nice clothes. 
He is a talented musician. He is, by all standards, 
functional. Yet despite this exterior, Jeff struggles 
with opioid use disorder. 

Before arriving on campus, Jeff did not do drugs. 
He had smoked marijuana only three times in his life 
and rarely, if ever, drank alcohol. His views aligned 
with societal norms; he thought drugs were “bad” 
and had no desire to start using them, he said. 
But after coming to Yale, Jeff’s attitude changed. 
He began drinking during his freshman year at par-
ties and other social gatherings—but only moder-
ately, “like any normal freshman,” he said. In addi-
tion, many of the older students in Jeff’s music group 
smoked often, and Jeff and his fellow freshmen in 
the group felt encouraged to join them. “It wasn’t 
anything crazy, just about once a week,” Jeff said, 
describing the frequency of his use. He remembers 
being really excited about drinking and smoking with 
friends. Getting high and drunk was novel and fun, 
he said. 

During his sophomore year, Jeff’s drug use ramped 
up. He started smoking much more regularly—one, 
two, even three times a day. He had grown tired of 
the pressure of school and found that smoking helped 
him cope with stress. By the end of his sophomore 
year, “I was addicted to weed,” he said.

Jeff’s foray into drugs other than alcohol and mar-
ijuana did not start until the spring semester of his 
junior year, when he was studying abroad in Amster-
dam. He made a group of friends there who intro-
duced him to a variety of new substances: MDMA 
(ecstasy), cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mush-
rooms. 

Jeff was excited to push his limits. Marijuana and 
alcohol had become all too familiar. The new drugs 
seemed like windows into unknown worlds. “I was 
using for the novelty,” he said. “My overall theory 
was that I would know myself better as a person if I 
had had every experience known to man.” 

He tried several new substances overseas and 
continued using them, though less often, when he 
returned to the U.S. But there were some paths he 
was afraid to go down: “The two drugs I told myself 
I’d never do were methamphetamine and heroin,” he 
said, knowing them to be especially addictive. 

Then, just a few months later, Jeff got his wisdom 
teeth removed and was prescribed oxycodone, an 
opioid painkiller. He was given dozens of pills but 
told to take only a few as needed. Jeff started with 
a couple, but he did not stop there. Loving the way 
they made him feel, “I took one, two, three, until I 
finished the bottle,” he said. “I had no idea that I was 
getting addicted to these [pills]. I was so oblivious to 
the fact that these are aggressively addicting.” 

Before he knew it, he was hooked. He went back 
to the pharmacy and got a refill. When he finished 
the refill, he searched around his house and found 
several of his parents’ old prescriptions. When he ran 
out of those, he turned to the Dark Web—the black 
market of the Internet—where he ordered a nasal 
spray laced with fentanyl, an opioid up to 50 times 
more potent than heroin. (According to the Office of 
the Chief Medical Officer, fentanyl is projected to 
kill 644 people in Connecticut in 2017, more than 
any other drug.) Jeff used the nasal spray every day 
for the rest of the summer.  

While he was using, no one, himself included, 
realized that he was becoming seriously addicted. He 
was able to keep up his music and maintain strong 
friendships. Some of his friends were faintly aware 
that he was using narcotics recreationally—Jeff said 
he sometimes even offered his friends the nasal spray 
at parties—but it did not strike them as a big deal. 
Because Jeff appeared “functional”—he had a 
job that summer and the “Yale student” label still 
applied to him—his struggle with opioid use stayed 
under the radar. “It’s definitely possible to be a pro-
ductive member of society as an addict,” Jeff said. 

A few times, his friends caught him nodding off, a 
sign of an opioid high. Still, no one suspected he was 
struggling with addiction. 

Upon returning to campus in the fall, Jeff stopped 
using for a few days when he did not have access to 
narcotics. He felt extremely hot one moment and 
awfully cold the next. Every minor prick and pres-
sure caused him immense pain, and he suffered 
uncontrollable diarrhea. Going through withdrawal

was one of the most miserable experiences in his life, 

The solution was clear to him: he would swear off 
opioids forever. He had not signed up for this when 
he started abusing prescription painkillers a month 
earlier. Jeff described having a “coming to Jesus 
moment” and was determined to get sober. 

But after two months without opioids, Jeff was feel-
ing restless on a dreary November day and decided to 
order more fentanyl from the Internet. Boredom and 
loneliness were his two biggest triggers. On nights 
when not much was happening and he did not have 
an outlet for his restlessness, he struggled to resist 
using narcotics. Even though he was well aware of 
the risk of relapsing, “I was not in a place where I 
cared,” he said.

A couple evenings later, Jeff, high on fentanyl, 
fell to the floor of his off-campus apartment. Upon 
finding him lying unconscious, one of his roommates 
called an ambulance, which arrived in time to inject 
him with Narcan, a highly effective antidote. Had 
an ambulance not come, Jeff almost certainly would 
have died. He was discharged from the hospital the 
next morning.  

Although Jeff was in New Haven at the time, he 
was not enrolled in Yale. As a result, he was not at risk 
of facing disciplinary consequences, and his room-
mate was able to call for help without any hesitation.  
Had Jeff been enrolled, he could have been brought 
before the Executive Committee, which could have 
imposed a punishment ranging from “reprimand” to 
“expulsion,” according to Yale College Undergrad-
uate Regulations. Jeff overdosed in the fall of 2016. 
At the time, the University handled all drug-related 
incidents on a case-by-case basis, so there was no 
way of knowing exactly how Jeff’s situation would 
have turned out. In the spring of 2014, thirty-three 
drug-related cases were brought before the Executive 
Committee, according to the Executive Committee 
Chair’s Report from that spring. The Report does not 
specify the outcomes of those cases.

The new Medical Emergency Policy, however, 
states that a person “consuming alcohol or other 
drugs who is helped will not be charged by the Yale 
College Executive Committee with alcohol or other 
drug violations, but may have to complete coun-
seling, educational, or training programs within an 
agreed upon timeframe.” Under this policy, a student 
in the same position as Jeff would not be brought 
before the Executive  Committee.

n January 2014, Clay Dupuy stood helpless in 
the Hopper College courtyard as he watched his 
friend get handcuffed and carried away by four 
Yale policemen. He and his friend had taken LSD a 
few hours earlier. 

Clay began using LSD during his freshman fall to 
cope with his depression, which was undiagnosed at 
the time. “I discovered that I could use [LSD and 
marijuana] recreationally, and have everyone believe 
that I was using just as they were, when really it was 
quite therapeutic for me,” he said. 

Over winter break, Clay was formally diagnosed 
with bipolar disorder and prescribed medicine, so he
