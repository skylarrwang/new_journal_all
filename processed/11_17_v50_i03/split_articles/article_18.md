While his girlfriend lay asleep in bed beside him, he snorted lines off his desk.
daily and began experimenting with new drugs, like 
cocaine, LSD and MDMA. His substance use and 
anxiety gradually worsened throughout the year, but 
he was able to keep up with his social life and aca-
demics, even maintaining above a 3.5 GPA. 
After the incident in the Silliman tower early in 
his sophomore year, Wes spent the weekend at home. 
Although his parents could tell that something was 
wrong, he did not tell them about the cocaine and 
LSD, saying he had had an anxiety attack and needed 
to unwind for a few days at home. 
Wes returned to campus before the next school 
week, but his façade was about to come crashing 
down. His drug use was out of control, and a month 
finto the semester, he was nearly a month behind on 
his schoolwork. One night, he had to read an entire 
book for seminar the next day and felt he needed 
something to get him through it. “If I do cocaine, I’ll 
be able to read the whole book,” he thought. While 
his girlfriend lay asleep in bed beside him, he snorted 
lines off his desk. By 6 a.m., he had run out of the 
drug. He crashed. When he woke up, he realized he 
had slept through the seminar. 
 “I was in the middle of a trifecta: I had crippling 
anxiety; I was a month behind on schoolwork a 
month into the semester; I couldn’t stop doing drugs 
and drinking,” Wes said. It was at that moment that 
he decided to take a medical withdrawal.
T
he threat of disciplinary action is not the only 
barrier between students who struggle with 
substance use disorder and a willingness to 
seek help. “Shame  about having a problem with 
drugs or alcohol, compounded with concerns about 
how the person with the problem will be viewed, get 
in the way of people talking openly about substance 
use or getting help when they need it,” said Dr. Rich-
ard Schottenfeld, former Head of Davenport College 
and a leader in the field of addiction science. 
Wes said much of the shame he felt kept him from 
seeking help. And Jeff observed that being stigma-
tized for using drugs is harmful: “The one thing that 
I’d tell Yalies is to question the stigma, to question 
the prevailing norms surrounding substance abuse, 
and in that, to question the way they treat people.” 
Two days after overdosing, Jeff resumed using fen-
tanyl. A few months later, he quit, but then relapsed 
within weeks. Eventually, at the beginning of the 
summer of 2017, he went to rehab and has been 
sober ever since. But he still worries that, if he ever 
gets bored or lonely enough, he might relapse again. 
Wes spent his year and a half away from Yale at 
a residential treatment center, where he made large 
strides in his struggle with substance use disorder. He 
was reinstated in Yale in the spring of 2017.  
As he finished telling me his story on a sunny Sep-
tember day in the Silliman courtyard, his mood was 
remarkably upbeat. “I’ve built myself into a person I 
can be proud of,” he said. There were a few setbacks 
along the way, but “every time I slipped, I picked 
myself up faster each time.” 
With Yale’s updated drug policy, students will 
hopefully be more upfront about their drug use 
and seek the resources they need. Although the pol-
icy applies only to emergency situations, it is a step 
toward creating a culture of openness. Still, students 
and school officials must continue working on ways 
to dispel the stigmas that have prevented many from 
seeking help.
