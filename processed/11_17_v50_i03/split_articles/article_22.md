T
he door through which Reyes Alvarez fled deporta-
tion now marks the limit of his world. The entrance 
to 425 College Street, the side door of First and Sum-
merfield, is made of dull metal, with a scratched, square 
window at eye level. Between eight in the morning and 
five in the evening, it’s unlocked, constantly opening and 
closing with the flow of people through the building. After 
hours, visitors must press a buzzer to be let in. For the past 
three months, this door has been the only thing between 
Reyes Alvarez’s current safety and the certain deportation 
that lurks beyond. On the inside, he’s protected through 
ICE’s “sensitive locations” policy; on the outside, he’s vul-
nerable to immediate arrest.

Though ICE has kept its word on sensitive locations, 
immigration activists worry that the policy isn’t permanent. 
“[ICE] says it won’t do anything in those buildings, but that 
can change from one day to another,” said John Jairo Lugo. 
“Maybe one day we’ll wake up with a new memo from the 
government, and that would be a nightmare for undocu-
mented immigrants.”

This past spring, Paul Fleck said, a group of religious 
leaders from the New Haven area met with Deirdre Daly, 
the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and an 
ICE community relations officer, who affirmed that agents 
would not enter sanctuary spaces unless in the case of a 
public threat. Even so, he said, “my trust for ICE is rather 
limited.”

“It’s just striking the American public now what an arbi-
trary, worse than Kafka-esque, rogue agency, in many senses 
[ICE] is,” said Ramon Garibaldo Valdez, a member of ULA 
and second-year student in Yale’s political science PhD pro-
gram. “We’re just going off this intuition [that] they have 
usually been somewhat respectful of churches, but that 
precedent does not stand on very strong ground.”

New Haven is a sanctuary city, which means that its 
police officers cannot provide assistance to ICE in the case 
of a federal immigration action or inquire about someone’s 
immigration status. But the sanctuary city status is less 
secure than many realize; it’s a federal designation that has 
no substantial legal backing.

“We’re blind to status,” Mayor Toni Harp told me one 
morning at City Hall. Since the early 2000s, the New Haven 
Police Department has had a general order stating that offi-
cers do not ask people for their immigration status. Public 
school officials are not supposed to inquire about a student’s 
status either, and city services are based on residency, not 
place of origin, she said.

Yet there has been no real push from the New Haven 
Board of Alders to formally undergird the city’s sanctuary 
status, Harp added. The Trump administration’s threat to 
pull federal funding from sanctuary cities doesn’t weaken 
the city’s commitment to protecting undocumented immi-
grants, she said, but city leaders don’t want to put a bullseye 
on New Haven. So, they have adopted more modest mea-
sures, like distributing five-thousand copies of a pocket-sized 
“Family Emergency Preparedness Guide” to schools, hospi-
tals, and libraries, to inform undocumented immigrants of 
their rights in case ICE agents show up at their door.

A decade ago, New Haven experienced federal backlash 
after instituting measures to support its undocumented resi-
dents. In 2006, the city released its Elm City Resident card, 
a first-of-its-kind municipal identification card for undoc-
umented immigrants. A year later, ICE agents conducted 
a massive raid across New Haven, deporting over thirty 
people at once. In the carefully-selected words of City Hall 
spokesman Laurence Grotheer, the federal government 
“took exception” to the city’s new ID program. In the words 
of Jairo Lugo, the raid was a flat-out “retaliation.”

“Just today, I heard they’re going to start doing raids in 
California because the government there wants to keep the 
state a sanctuary,” he said on the phone one afternoon in 
October. He fears that something similar may soon happen 
in New Haven. “We don’t know when, but we’re getting 
ready for it.”

Even in his secluded room in First and Summerfield, the 
ever-present threat of an ICE raid hangs over Reyes Alva-
rez and his family. After all, the side door is almost always 
unlocked.   
“We pray a lot to be safe,” said Torres Reyes. “That’s why

most of the time, someone is here with me, either me or 
Jesus [Morales Sanchez] or John Jairo [Lugo]…because if 
something happens, they can be witnesses of what’s going 
on.”

O
ver the past three months, the front steps of First 
and Summerfield have become a gathering place 
for political action in New Haven. Reyes Alvarez’s 
supporters flocked to the nine brown stone steps when he 
first entered the church, and later, when the Trump Admin-
istration announced its decision to rescind DACA. It is here 
that city and state officials have pledged their support for 
Reyes Alvarez and his family.

But it hasn’t always been the case that high-profile legis-
lators, or even the mayor, have showed up to support cases 
like these. “Back in the day, we had to beg them to support 
us, but they’ve become more willing to work with the immi-
grant community,” Jairo Lugo said. “At the same time, it’s 
good for the case when they are in solidarity with Marco.”

On the day of Reyes Alvarez’s arrival at First and Sum-
merfield, Senator Blumenthal stood behind the iron fence 
where a neon green sign read “IMMIGRANTS MAKE 
AMERICA” and called for a new hearing in Reyes Alvarez’s 
case. “Our country is better than the policies that have been 
adopted in the last seven months and focus on people who 
have lived here for decades, worked hard, paid taxes, raised 
families,” Blumenthal said over the noise of buses rumbling 
down Elm Street. “Our country is better than policies that 
tear apart families.”

Connecticut politicians like Blumenthal and U.S. Repre-
sentative Rosa DeLauro say that the ICE policies that have 
singled out undocumented immigrants like Ryes Alvarez 
betray the unusual malice of the Trump administration.

“One policy the president spoke about was that the 
deportations would target dangerous felons, not upstanding 
members of our community like Mr. Reyes,” said DeLauro, 
who has also attended rallies for Reyes Alvarez, told me in 
October. “The administration has lied about what they said 
they were doing. It’s a cruel reversal of policy.”

DeLauro sees Reyes Alvarez’s case in the context of the 
long haul: comprehensive immigration reform. “If we win 
back the House of Representatives, we can change a num-
ber of these policies that have been willy-nilly reversed,” she 
said. 

The 2018 election, however, is a long time for Reyes Alva-
rez to wait. For him, life continues, day-by-day, in his small 
room in a corner of First and Summerfield, far from the 
noise of the church’s front steps. By nature a quiet man, over 
the past few months, Reyes Alvarez has become a spokes-
man for the predicament that he, and many other undocu-
mented immigrants, now find themselves in. It’s a role he 
doesn’t seem entirely comfortable with, but has come to 
accept.

“All of us are afraid—but not all of us can do what I am 
doing either,” he says in Spanish one afternoon in October. 
“Everyone always waits for another to sacrifice themselves, 
so I guess, recently, it’s my turn. But it’s not that anyone 
would want to be here and call attention to themselves to 
say something. I just did it to stay with my family and my 
wife.”

Ramon Garibaldo Valdez says that people tend to under-
estimate the force of Reyes Alvarez’s will. He’s isn’t a victim, 
Garibaldo Valdez says, but has fully accepted responsibility 
for his decision to take sanctuary. He speaks at rallies that 
aren’t even about his case, supporting ULA members in any 
way he can. “I don’t think the first thing that comes to his 
mind is ‘I’ve been in this country for twenty years.’ I think 
it’s the idea that ‘I have to be here for another twenty years 
for my children, especially my youngest, Adriana.’”

“If people want to get a sense of urgency for immigration, 
they shouldn’t look at large picture data on immigration, 
they should just see this one case,” Garibaldo Valdez added. 
“The possibility of Adriana staying without a father…that’s 
what people need to center.”

Although Torres Reyes and the children can return home 
at night, the anxiety and gravity of Reyes Alvarez’s predica-

ment has upended their lives, too. The result of the motion 
to reopen his case could come tomorrow, or next month, 
or next year. For all of them, as the weeks pass, First and 
Summerfield feels less like a refuge and more like a prison.

n a Monday night in October, the sanctuary of First 
and Summerfield is full of voices, as dozens of peo-
ple take seats in a circle of chairs. John Jairo Lugo, 
wearing an imitation bird foot around his neck, balances a 
laptop on his knees and calls the weekly ULA meeting to 
order.

It’s Columbus Day—Indigenous Peoples’ Day—and Jairo 
Lugo is wearing a black shirt with an image of Native Amer-
icans and “Homeland Security Fighting Terrorism Since 
1492” written in white block print. Fluorescent light from 
the streetlamps filters through the church’s stained-glass 
windows. The doors next to the altar are open, and across 
the hall, a square of light glows in the window of the door 
to Reyes Alvarez’s room. His wife emerges with a few other 
relatives and takes a seat.

Jairo Lugo asks if there are any cases people want to dis-
cuss. There’s a family across the circle from Torres Reyes, a 
father and mother with a small boy leaning against their legs. 
The man stands, his hair slicked back, hands shoved into his 
pockets. He has a deportation order for early November, he 
says. A few seats down from Torres Reyes, a woman who has 
been fighting a deportation order says that she must present 
herself for supervision in the next few weeks.

In the New Haven area, there are two or three new cases 
like Reyes Alvarez’s every week, Jairo Lugo later tells me 
over the phone from outside the federal immigration court-
house in Hartford: “We walked out from the courthouse and 
just picked a new case.” The frequency of these cases has 
rapidly increased since the election, and in his mind, it’s 
only going to worsen.  

“There’s a huge increase of people who are doing what 
they need to do—showing up to check in—who are then 
notified that they have to leave the country, their stays are 
denied, and they are placed on a GPS unit,” Reyes Alvarez’s 
attorney O’Neil-Baker said.

Since ICE agents sometimes show up at court when 
undocumented immigrants attempt to appear for their court 
dates, ULA organizes groups that can accompany them, a 
show of emotional but also physical support.

“We believe that ICE is much more likely to not detain 
someone if they see people around them, and even if they 
were to do that, it helps us because we know it happened, 
we have witnesses, people recording badge numbers,” says 
Morales Sanchez.

Reyes Alvarez’s case now hinges upon a decision from 
the Board of Immigration Appeals that could come any day, 
or not for a long time. There is little organizing that could 
swing the balance in his favor. But for other cases, like that 
of Franklin and Gioconda Ramos, acts of civil disobedience 
can make a difference, Morales Sanchez says.

“We’re going to do anything that is in our power. We’re 
going to interrupt your operations. We’re going to make 
noise outside your offices, or in the case a few weeks ago, 
we’re going to sit down and not let anyone into your build-
ing,” he adds, referring to ICE. “We’re going to disrupt your 
day and hopefully, that disruption will add enough pressure 
to have them change their minds.”

At the end of the ULA meeting, Torres Reyes chats with 
some of the other members and helps dismantle the circle, 
stacking chair after chair in the corner. Then she slips away 
across the hall, into the room where her husband’s light is 
still on.


**Title: Sunday Service**

A
t 10 a.m. on a Sunday morning in October, the bell 
tower of First and Summerfield begins to chime and 
Reyes Alvarez and his wife walk into the light-filled 
sanctuary.

“Hi, Fanny, how are you doing?” says one of the elderly 
greeters at the threshold. 
“I’m O.K.,” she responds with a quiet smile.

“It’s hard, it’s hard,” the woman says, embracing her.

Reyes Alvarez goes over to a small display at the entrance 
to the church and picks out his plastic nametag, like the 
other parishioners. As others trickle in, he and his wife take 
their seats facing the altar, near the front.

Despite the overcast sky and drizzle outside, the tall 
green and yellow stained-glass windows on either side of the 
room shimmer with light. About twenty people have come 
to the service this morning, and though there are many 
empty seats, the room echoes with the voices of children.

Pastor Juhye Hahn, dressed in white and green vestments, 
stands behind a lectern, her voice ringing out high and clear 
as she calls the congregation to worship. The lectern’s dark 
wood perfectly matches the soaring altarpiece behind her. 
Its elegant, rectangular base supports a thin wooden cross 
and is topped with an angled square that holds her Bible. It 
is positioned a few feet in front of the altar; Hahn is close 
enough to hold the gaze of individual parishioners. Reyes 
Alvarez built the lectern over a few days in the church’s 
sub-basement. It is his gift to the congregation.

When Hahn became First and Summerfield’s pastor this
