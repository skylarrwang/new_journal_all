Turkey’s divisions materialize on Middletown Avenue

O
n October 29, ninety-four years after the 
founding of the secular Republic of Turkey, a 
solemn Turkish-American man named Feray 
Gökçek stands before thirty people in his backyard 
on Middletown Avenue, across the Quinnipiac River 
from Fair Haven. A two-and-a-half-ton, thirteen-foot-
tall bronze statue of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first 
president of Turkey, looms over him. “What we are 
doing here today,” Gökçek says in Turkish, “is contrib-
uting to world peace and protecting democracy and 
secularism.” Barely a smile crosses his lips. It is raining, 
and from a stereo on his screened porch the Turkish 
national anthem plays, followed by the American one. 
The listeners stand observant, arms at their sides.

Gökçek grew up in a city in Turkey on the Black 
Sea, but left in 1991 to escape political violence. He 
says he was a freedom fighter. He erected the statue of 
Atatürk on May 19, 2016, the one-hundred-and-thirty-
sixth anniversary of Atatürk’s birth. He is a member of 
the Atatürk Union of USA, a private organization made 
up of about one hundred and fifty people around the 
East Coast who support Atatürk, secularism, democ-
racy, and freedom. The entire Union helped pay for 
the statue. It was originally supposed to go up in New 
Jersey in another member’s yard, but they didn’t own 
the land. Gökçek volunteered his. Bronze Atatürk’s 
face is tilted up in a fierce, mysterious smile. His right 
hand clutches his suit jacket. At his feet, Gökçek refills 
vases of red and white carnations every week. 

Gökçek plans to rename a tiny street near his house 
“Atatürk Street.” He has collected over three hundred 
signatures to petition the city. “From Dunkin’ Donuts,” 
he explains, “from Walmart, the oil change, the hotel, 
downtown, Lowe’s, Aldi, the barber shop.”  He points 
out that a street in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, is called 
John F. Kennedy Caddesi (“avenue” in Turkish), in 
recognition of JFK’s support for strong Turkish-Ameri-
can relations. John F. Kennedy Caddesi is a major bou-
levard. Scarboro Street is a 250-foot dead-end that runs 
alongside Gökçek’s yard.

He calls his yard “Atapark.” Turkish and American 
flags of all sizes fly side by side. He refers to a hut in the 
yard as “Ankara,” and to his house as “Çankaya,” the 
Turkish equivalent of the White House, which Atatürk 
built in 1921. President Erdoğan replaced it with a pal-
ace called the Presidential Complex in 2014. “He fuck 
it up,” Gökçek says. “Sorry–my language. He is an ass-
hole. He is an asshole.”

There are three signs on Gökçek’s fence: a list of all 
the cities in Turkey, the words “Adalet–Justice” in red 
against a white background, and a laminated, blown-up 
biography page about Atatürk from BBC History. 
Behind the page, Gökçek has painted “HAYIR”—“No,” 
in Turkish—in response to Erdoğan’s 2017 referen-
dum to strengthen his presidential powers, which he 
narrowly won. Gökçek supports the CHP, also called 
the Republican People’s Party—Turkey’s secular, leftist 
opposition party, the party of Atatürk. Erdoğan leads 
the AKP, also called the Justice and Development 
Party—the Islamic conservative party. Under Erdoğan, 
Turkey’s government has become increasingly reli-
gious and authoritarian. In just three years, between 
2006 and 2009, he constructed nine thousand Otto-
man-style mosques in Turkey. Thousands of Turks have 
been arrested for denouncing his presidency. Some 
have begun to call him “Sultan Erdoğan.”

A
cross the street from Atapark, a Turkish govern-
ment-funded mosque has been under construc-
tion for at least two years. The Turkish Direc-
torate of Religious Affairs—the religious chapter of the 
Turkish government, founded in 1924 under Atatürk—
funds an American organization called the Diyanet 
Center of America. With this funding, the center has 
helped pay for Turkish mosques in other cities around 
the U.S. including Louisville, Charlotte, Portland, and 
Queens. The Turkish Diyanet gave the New Haven 
congregation white minarets and a white dome with 
glaucous tops and crescent peaks. They were shipped 
across the ocean from Turkey in over a hundred 
pieces  and reassembled on Middletown Avenue. But 
the staggering eighty-one-foot tall minarets apparently 
violated city zoning law, and construction was halted. 
City officials and the congregation’s president, Haydar 
Elevli, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

When I visit the mosque on a Friday morning before 
prayers, it is full of congregants even though it’s still 
under construction. Elevli’s wife shows me the carpeted
