**Title: Traces of Spice**

A 
few days into my first year at Yale,   I was talking 
to my father on the phone. As any good Asian 
parent is wont to do, he asked me about the food.
“Is it good?” he said. “Are you eating properly?”


There was a pause on my end. My first response was 
to say yes, of course I was. I was doing fine. I had begun 
to develop that tone of disdain that first-years adopt 
when talking to their parents. I was a college student 
now; didn’t my dad understand that I was busy? But I 
caught myself. I listened carefully to the sweetness of 
his voice, the melancholy uptick at the end of each of 
his questions. I realized that my father missed me. So 
I drew my breath and told the truth: “It’s okay. Some-
thing’s missing though.”


“Maybe it’s the spice?”


He was right—it was the lack of seasoning that I 
missed, the salt and cumin and peppers that flavored 
my memories of home. I didn’t want to cry, so I hung 
up with a soft spoken I love you and Yelped “Asian 
Market.” Hong Kong Market was less than five minutes 
from my residential college. 


I walked up Whitney Avenue in the dim evening 
light. The grocery store’s windows were packed with 
posters of xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and bags of 
jasmine rice. A familiar language drifted through the 
open door: Mandarin. It was a language I learned at a 
young age through my bilingual school in New York, 
but hadn’t heard that much since. 


When I entered and asked the cashier for chili pep-
pers, she gestured to the stairs a few feet away and asked 
me to follow. We went down to the basement and past a 
tall shelf with peeling white paint full of dried ginseng. 
It smelled like Flushing, Queens, the air thick with the 
aroma of soy sauce and natural decay. She led me to 
a supermarket fridge and pointed to the small plastic 
bags of red and green peppers. At home, we only had 
the bright, kelly-green kind. But the shape was right. 
I leaned in and realized the smell was right too. They 
were in that exact plastic bagging that I had only ever 
seen in Indian markets and inside my refrigerator. 
They were the quick fix I was looking for, the garnish 
that could make any meal taste a bit more like home.


As the subtle, crisp smell of spice crept into my nose, 
I remembered the warning my mother gave me when 
I left for college. She said I would miss the food, but I 
hadn’t listened. I thought I knew better. I thought I’d 
miss other things—the smell of my cat, the subway, the 
early-morning sing-song of ambulances. I had been to 
sleep-away camp before, deprived of my home food for 
weeks on end, and it hadn’t bothered me. Why would 
college be any different?


At first, the dining hall seemed to offer all the food 
that I could possibly want. But after a few days, I found 
her warning came true. I missed the spice, the aro-

mas wafting from my kitchen as my mother made fish 
curry, the crackle of turmeric karela hitting the pan.


Snapping out of my reverie, I was still clutching the 
plastic bag of chili peppers under the blue-green fluo-
rescent lights of the Hong Kong Market. When I went 
back upstairs to check out, the cashier mentioned that 
the shipment of chili peppers had just come in. 
“You’re very lucky,” she said. “A lot of students come 
in looking for that.”


Her response surprised me. Maybe I wasn’t the only 
person struggling to find home in Yale Dining food. I 
hadn’t even considered the possibility that other stu-
dents could be having the same experience; everyone 
always seemed happy enough to chow down on the 
same unsalted mashed potatoes and chickpea salad. 
When I brought my chili peppers to the Berkeley 
dining hall that evening,  I plopped the plastic bag on 
the table,  took out three peppers, and placed them on 
my plate. My best friend Irene chuckled. Clearly, I was 
desperate.  But when other first-years at the table saw 
my peppers, they began listing the things they missed 
the most: a mother’s congee, a barbecued bit of pork, 
a salty soup, a certain sauce. All of our memories from 
home came down to our dinner plates.


The few Indian restaurants in New Haven don’t 
make food exactly like my parents do, but I’ll take it. 
Sometimes there isn’t enough ginger or methi. Some-
times there’s too much salt. I tried to be okay with the 
sambar from Thali Too, though it wasn’t the same as 
what my father makes in the pressure cooker when I’m 
sick. This is my new home, I keep telling myself. I have 
to be okay with the food being different because every-
thing is different. 


But even as I attempted to recreate the pang of lamb 
biryani or rogan josh with my peppers, homemade food 
is as much about the culture the cuisine comes from 
as it is about the people who make it. I’d be lying if I 
said I didn’t miss my parents.  My roommate tells me 
one night that she misses the feeling of saying hi to 
everyone in her Greek village with the knowledge that 
“everyone knows everyone.” But she claims she doesn’t 
think much about the food. She’s too preoccupied with 
meeting new people, reveling in her new life here. She 
could go years without eating Greek food, she tells me. 
She’s sure that this is her home now. She’s perfectly sat-
isfied with her meals at Timothy Dwight. But she also 
tells me proudly that she refuses to eat Greek food that 
isn’t from Greece or her parents’ kitchen.


“But,” I ask, “didn’t you go to a Greek restaurant last 
week?” 
“Yes,” she says. “But it wasn’t the same.”


“I know.”
