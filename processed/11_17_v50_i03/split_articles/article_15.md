BY NO MEANS
IMMUNE
BY MAX GRAHAM
“I
f this gets any worse, I’ll think I can fly,” 
Wes thought, as he looked down onto College 
Street from the top of the Silliman tower. He 
had taken LSD and cocaine an hour or two earlier. 
Afraid of what might come next, he backed away 
from the window. 

Within moments, he threw up.

 He closed his eyes. A feeling of doom swept over 
him. He was certain that he had died and was experi-
encing a post-death state. 

He dialed home.
 “Mom, I think I’m dying.”
“Physically or mentally?” 
“Both.” 
He hung up the phone, got in a cab to Union Sta-
tion, and boarded a train home to New York.

feared he was overdosing, he was actually just having 
a bad trip, an experience marked by overwhelming 
terror and anxiety that can occur when using LSD. 
About thirty minutes before arriving in New York, 
Wes sobered up. Only then did he realize he was safe. 
Five days after this harrowing episode, Wes (a 
pseudonym used to protect his identity) requested a 
medical withdrawal from Yale, telling school officials 
that he needed time off to seek help for “depression 
and anxiety.” He intentionally omitted the real rea-
son: substance use disorder, otherwise known as drug 
addiction.

Wes did not disclose his drug use because he wor-
ried about getting in trouble. He thought the univer-
sity would be more sympathetic if he claimed he was 
seeking help for depression. If he told his dean he 
did drugs, he assumed there would be disciplinary or 
legal consequences.

At the time, there was no written policy suggesting 
that the University would treat the use of illicit drugs 
as a medical concern. The Yale College Undergrad-
uate Regulations lists “unlawful possession, use, pur-
chase, or distribution of illicit drugs or controlled 
substances (including stimulants, depressants, nar-
cotics, or hallucinogenic drugs)” under “offenses 
subject to disciplinary action.” In other words, Yale’s 
only written policy on drug use was labeled as a dis-
ciplinary issue. 

On October 23, 2017, the University updated its 
Medical Emergency Policy. The new Policy states 
that if a student overdoses on alcohol or drugs and 
another student calls for help, neither student will 
face disciplinary action. The goal of the policy is to 
ensure that students will not hesitate to seek help in 
the event of a substance use emergency. Before the 
change, the Medical Emergency Policy only covered 
alcohol. If a student overdosed on heroin or cocaine, 
for example, they would not have been exempt from 
disciplinary charges.

It was and still is Yale policy that if a student gets 
caught using drugs in any non-emergency situation, 
even if they suffer from substance use disorder, they 
are subject to disciplinary action. However, this does 
not mean the student will be disciplined. There have 
been cases in which students struggling with sub-
stance use disorder were forthcoming with school 
administrators and did not face punishment.

After becoming the first-ever director of Yale’s 
Alcohol and Other Drugs Harm Reduction Initiative 
(AODHRI) in June 2017, Dr. Lynn Fiellin pushed 
hard to update the Medical Emergency Policy to 
encompass “other drugs.” Emphasizing that the 
health and safety of students should be the Univer-
sity’s primary concern, she argued that it “makes no 
sense” for a medical emergency policy to apply only 
to alcohol. Students are more likely to trust a policy 
that covers all substances.  

As for why the policy was not changed until Octo-
ber 2017, Yale College Dean of Student Affairs 
Camille Lizarribar said the delay was not due to 
concerns with changing the policy, but rather the 
fact that “it took time to get input, changes, and pro-
cesses in place.” She said the biggest challenges were 
logistical, such as the arrival of Dean Chun and the 
death of three students last fall, which required more 
urgent attention.

Riley Tillitt, a senior and president of Yale Students 
for a Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), an undergradu-
ate organization that pushed for the policy change, 
said his organization did not face much resistance 
from the administration. “I think most deans would 
support a drug amnesty policy,” he said, adding that 
the most common argument against it was a concern 
it would encourage drug use. 

Tillitt’s predecessor at SSDP, Clay Dupuy, a senior, 
said the University wanted to wait and see how the 
alcohol Medical Emergency Policy would pan out 
before they extended it to all substances. According 
to both him and Dr. Fiellin, there has been an uptick 
in the number of transports called for alcohol-related 
emergencies since the alcohol policy was adopted. 
The increase could have been due to higher levels of 
alcohol consumption or the fact that people are more 
comfortable calling for help. Dr. Fiellin believes it 
is the latter, saying the alcohol Medical Emergency 
Policy has been a success and ought to serve as fur-
ther evidence that the policy should include other 
drugs. 

Concerns about the worsening opioid epidemic 
also influenced the policy change. Although the rate 
of opioid overdoses at Yale is lower than the national 
average,  “Yale is by no means immune to the national
