A bus ride through New Haven reveals the deficiencies of the city’s transit system

A
fter two heart attacks, a stroke, and thir-
ty-seven days in the Palm Beach County Jail, 
Dennis DeMartin had grown tired of Florida. 
Following an incident that caused him to lose his Del-ray Beach condo, he moved into a federal housing proj-
ect in New Haven called Bella Vista. His apartment is 
near the end of the 212 bus line, close to his childhood 
home in West Haven. Since he doesn’t own a car, the 
212 is his only means of leaving the housing complex. “I 
live alone. The walls close in on me,” he said. 

A stout 74-year-old man with white hair and a bushy, 
Santa Claus-esque beard, DeMartin is buoyant and 
energetic. He uses the bus to visit friends, family, and 
his doctor. “I take four buses a day,” he said. “I rely on 
the bus one hundred percent for everything I have to 
do.”

The buses of Greater New Haven are the veins of the 
region. For those without access to a private vehicle, 
public transportation is not an alternative mode of tran-
sit. It’s a lifeline. In Dixwell, Dwight, Downtown, and 
the Hill, more than 35 percent of the population does 
not own a car.  For those residents, public transit is their 
primary, if not sole, mode of access to employment, 
education, healthcare, and even groceries.

The system is widely used: riders took 8.3 million trips 
in 2016. But delays, a disjointed central hub, disconnect 
from employment opportunities, and inconsistent dis-
ability access plague the system. These issues prompted 
the city to begin a collaborative study in October 2016 
called Move New Haven, a comprehensive review of 
the region’s bus network with support from the city, 
state, and regional authorities. After months of data col-
lection, the study released a report of transit statistics in 
August. This January, Move New Haven will unveil a 
series of recommendations for the system. A schedule 
for enacting those recommendations has not yet been 
set.

DeMartin has already completed his own study of 
New Haven’s bus network. In 2015, he self-published a 
book called Riding New Haven Buses. This past fall, he 
invited me to take a ride with him. We met on a cold, 
sunny day in November. I shivered against the wind 
as we walked down Elm Street toward the New Haven 
Green.

The main hub of the system includes eleven sepa-
rate bus shelters that line the Green and lower Chapel 
Street. End to end, the shelters stretch just under half 
a mile. It’s “not very customer-friendly,” said Matthew 
Nemerson, Director of Economic Development for 
New Haven. “It is spread out and open. [You have to] 
withstand the heat of the summer, the cold of the win-
ter.” Although cities across the country have central bus 
terminals, New Haven’s hub consists of nothing more 
than sidewalks and open shelters designated as bus 
stops.

When I arrived with DeMartin, the hub was teem-
ing with commuters. By our shelter, there were roughly 
fifteen people waiting, and large crowds were gathered 
back at the corner of Church and Chapel. All of the CT 
Transit routes run through Downtown New Haven—
there are no crosstown lines—so the stops around the 
Green are always busy.

DeMartin and I boarded the 212, one of the system’s 
most popular buses, at Temple and Elm, DeMartin’s 
usual stop. Most of the city’s current bus routes date 
back to New Haven’s extensive trolley system, which 
shut down in 1948. “The buses follow the same path-
ways as the trolleys,” Nemerson said. “People who want 
to change directions need to come into the center of 
town.”

This “hub and spoke” system is addressed by the 
Move New Haven study, which found that with the 
“single downtown hub…bus riders are forced to trans-
fer to complete cross-town trips and riders are forced 
downtown even if their travel does not require a down-
town visit.”

The system’s layout is especially problematic for peo-
ple living in the city and working in the suburbs. Jobs 
and industry that used to be clustered along Whalley and 
Winchester Avenues, such as the Winchester Repeating 
Arms Factory, have closed down or moved out to sub-
urban towns like Milford and Hamden. Of the approx-
imately 380 thousand jobs in the New Haven region, 
only eighty thousand are in city limits. For example, if 
someone worked in the Amity Plaza shopping center by 
the Merritt Parkway but lived on Morse Street in north-
ern Newhallville (a ten-minute drive away), they would 
have to take the 238 bus ten minutes to the Green, wait 
for the 243, and ride another eighteen minutes back out 
to Amity.

Doug Hausladen, former Ward 7 alder, has been New 
Haven’s Director for Public Transportation, Traffic, and 
Parking since 2014. According to him, the city is devis-
ing a plan to fix the bus hub by converting many one-
way streets surrounding the Green (and elsewhere in 
Downtown) to two-way streets, with the aim of reducing 
travel and transfer times. Hopefully, Move New Haven 
will also propose best practices for rerouting bus lines to 
better serve changing workforces and workplaces.

However, it is the Connecticut Department of Trans-
portation, and not the City of New Haven, that runs CT 
Transit, the service that manages New Haven’s network. 
Changes to the system happen at the state level, and 
New Haven commuters and officials often struggle to 
make their voices heard. “If you want to lobby a com-
plaint on CT Transit, there is no hearing, no meeting 
on public performance for CT Transit,” Hausladen said.

I inserted my bus pass into the small machine by the 
driver and sat in a window seat next to DeMartin as 
the bus rolled away from the Green. Despite opposition 
from New Haven Mayor Toni Harp and New Haven 
residents, fares were raised across the transit system last 
year to compensate for a $37.5 million cut in state fund-
ing. Now, the one-way fare for a local ride in the New 
Haven area is $1.75, up 17 percent from $1.50 a year ago. 
(By comparison, the commuter rail fare, which serves 
a population with a much higher median household 
income, increased only 5 percent.) “We’ve gone back-
wards on access to jobs and access to upward mobility,” 
Hausladen said. “In Connecticut, a lot of our poorest 
communities are in the biggest cities. We’re starving 
them from an adequate transit system.”

With the state distributing funding, cities often have 
to scrounge to finance their transit systems. “We have 
a great relationship but we have real needs,” Nemer-
son said of the association between New Haven and the 
Department of Transportation. “We need to fight with 
every other city in the state to get resources here.” In 
tough budget years like 2016, proposed state budgets 
drastically reduce funding for buses. Some of these 
proposed budgets eliminate it altogether. Although the 
more radical proposals get heavily amended, there have 
been budget cuts to bus service. Cities like New Haven 
are at the mercy of the state.

T
he 212 bus crossed the railroad tracks as we 
left Downtown and passed under I-95. Moving 
beneath the shadow of the abandoned English 
Power Station, we crossed a modest concrete bridge 
into Fair Haven. As we continued down Grand Avenue, 
past a bustling series of small grocers and Latin Amer-
ican restaurants, the bus slowed its pace as pedestrian 
and automobile traffic began to increase.

Traffic limits bus reliability in New Haven. Part of 
the problem is the overabundance of bus stops. On a 
recent ride I took on the 238 along Dixwell Avenue, the 
evening rush out of New Haven was repeatedly stalled 
by passengers disembarking. The bus stopped prac-
tically every block, and halfway through the route, at 
Dixwell Avenue and Putnam, we were already running 
twenty-eight minutes late, according to the schedule 
posted on CT Transit’s website.

Empirically assessing the reliability of New Haven’s 
bus lines is nearly impossible because CT Transit keeps 
no data on bus timeliness, according to Hausladen. 
As for a bus-tracking app, (e.g. TransLoc for the Yale 
Shuttle) CT Transit unveiled the “Transit” app in April. 
The real-time bus information app, however, doesn’t 
advertise any data on bus reliability. The Move New 
Haven study laments this lack of data, stating, “Reliabil-
ity issues are only known through information reported 
through community outreach.”

We left Fair Haven and headed into East Haven, 
crossing a rusting bridge over the Quinnipiac River. As 
we climbed the hill away from the riverbank, DeMar-
tin pointed out the homes of old ship captains that 
rose above the trees on the hills above the Quinnipiac. 
Behind the homes, at the crest of the hill, the goliath
