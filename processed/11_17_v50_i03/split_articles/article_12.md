Bella Vista towers rose into view.

Many of the residents at Bella Vista depend heavily 
on public transit. DeMartin maintains a waiting room 
for commuters, carved into the lobby of one of the 
larger towers. He makes sure that the latest schedules 
are always posted, and circles each of the bus times 
that are relevant to Bella Vista. Unlike nearly every 
bus stop in New Haven, the space offers commuters a 
warm place to wait for the bus in the winter. Move New 
Haven reports that of the 943 bus stops in New Haven 
maintained by the city, only 103 have shelters. Of those, 
only twenty-one have benches. None are heated.


On the way back from Bella Vista to downtown, we 
stopped at the corner of Church and Chapel, where the 
bus switched routes to the 238. The doors swung open 
to let a line of passengers board.

A middle-aged man in a wheelchair pulled up to 
the bus’s front door. The floor at the head of the bus 
popped outwards and became a ramp to the sidewalk. 
The man pushed forward, and the driver assisted him to 
the designated wheelchair spot on the bus. The passen-
gers occupying the area were glad to move. The driver 
knelt to connect the belt buckles that would hold the 
wheelchair in place, but the man waved him away and 
fastened them himself. 

Unfortunately, New Haven buses are not always so 
accommodating of riders with disabilities. Former 2017 
candidate for Ward 22 alder Yansee Horan, who uses a 
manual wheelchair, claims he has been treated poorly 
on public transit before. Horan, known as “Brother 
Born” in the Dixwell and Newhallville communities, 
has been riding buses for years. “Sometimes the buses 
get so packed,” Horan said. “You want to get on, but the 
driver’s like, ‘Yo, I can’t let you on. There’s too many 
people.’”

At a Move New Haven public presentation on the 
findings of Phase 1 on November 1, residents voiced sim-
ilar concerns. One elderly woman, a friend of DeMar-
tin, claimed her daughter, who is in a wheelchair, faced 
an identical situation: she was denied entry to a bus 
because passengers refused to move from the foldable 
seats. TC Taylor, a resident of the Dixwell neighbor-
hood who rides the 238 bus every day, said access is an 
even bigger problem in wintertime. “The [snowplows] 
push the snow drift higher and higher. They don’t have 
people in position to make the areas accessible to walk,” 
Taylor said. “You have children, the elderly, the ambu-
latory in the street. It’s virtually impossible for them…
to make that connection onto the bus.”

Horan agrees. “During the winter months, they rarely 
even clean the bus stops,” he said. “So during the win-
tertime, I’m going nowhere. Trust me on that.”

O
ur country is emerging from an era of car dom-
inance. The spaces we occupy, from grocery 
stores to school, privilege the private auto-
mobile, providing parking spaces and right-of-way. In 
Downtown New Haven, the Temple Street Garage 
looms over its neighboring properties, spanning two 
entire city blocks. Even at the Bella Vista housing com-
plex, parking garages occupy as much ground as the 
towers. Since the construction of the Oak Street Con-
nector in 1959, a network of highways has choked the 
city center.

But with a renewed interest in support for public 
transportation—through initiatives like Move New 
Haven—the city has been given another chance to 
condemn the inequitable and destructive policies of 
American car culture and become universally acces-
sible. Although the committee has not yet released its 
recommendations, inklings of what it could include 
have already been published in the first phase’s full 
report. Connecting routes to contemporary job loca-
tions, smarter intermodal connections, rethinking the 
hub and spoke system, and providing a reserved spot for 
wheelchairs at all times are just some of the many possi-
bilities. For many New Haven residents, like DeMartin, 
who rely on the city’s bus lines, simply identifying these 
problems is a sign of progress. If any of these ideas were 
pursued, New Haven would be better off.

“We design our ecosystems around the assumption 
of the automobile,” Hausladen said. “It used to be that 
civil rights was where on the bus you sat. Now it’s about 
where your bus goes and how long it takes to get there.”
