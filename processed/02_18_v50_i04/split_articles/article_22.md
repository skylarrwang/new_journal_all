THE  NEW  JOURNAL
I
f you were a potential employer or landlord, this is what 
you would learn about John Tejada from a quick inter-
net search: his age (40), his height (6’1”), his weight (260 
lbs), his race (black), his eyes (brown), his address (in Hart-
ford, Connecticut) how many scars he has (three: two on the 
knees, one on the ankle), his tattoos (the Superman logo on 
his right butt-cheek). You would also learn that he was con-
victed of sexual assault in the second degree in March 2014. 
This is information that John has to confirm or update every 
ninety days, when he gets his official letter in the mail. If he 
is late, state law enforcement will mark him “non-compliant” 
in bold, red type. You would find the headlines about John’s 
offense in tabloid-like papers like the Connecticut Post and 
the Cheshire Patch. You probably wouldn’t rent him an apart-
ment or give him a job.

You wouldn’t necessarily know that John was born in 
Brooklyn (the posh part) to a dentist and a judge, that he 
went to one of New York’s top public high schools, and that 
he completed a computer science degree at Notre Dame, 
where he was a nationally-ranked fencer. After graduating, 
he worked in administrative positions at Merrill Lynch, 
Lord and Taylor, and ESPN. These were the kinds of jobs 
that required him to wear a suit every day, and he liked that. 
You might find out that he coached high school fencing, first 
in New Jersey, then in Fairfield, CT. Along the way, he got 
married, had a baby, won state coach-of-the-year four times, 
became depressed, started fighting with his wife, and began 
an intimate relationship with one of the senior girls on the 
team. You would, almost certainly, learn that she was seven-
teen. John says that she came onto him and that they never 
actually had sex. What the statute for second degree assault 
reflects is that meaningful consent is impossible between an 
adult and a minor before the law. John doesn’t deny it: “I 
was a coach, in a position of power, absolutely…I know I did 
something wrong. I absolutely did. I know I hurt her.”  
It’s beside the point, but I like John. When he enters 
the Cedarhurst Café in New Haven, he is wearing a navy 
blue suit, a checkered shirt, a pocket square, and sunglasses 
perched atop his almost bald head. The suit surprises me: 
most of the people I’ve spoken with on the state sex-offender 
registry are unemployed, self-employed, or working at fast-
food restaurants. He saunters up to the counter and orders 
the “pumpkin spiced chai whatever it is” that is advertised 
on the chalkboard outside, which, when he comes to join 
me at the high table by the window, he says tastes like “warm 
pumpkin milk.” We agree that there are worse things. John 
has a soft, slow voice, which starts self-conscious, but grows 
self-assured as he gets deeper into his story.

Do our sex offender 
laws actually make 
communities safer?

The offense occurred six years ago. The victim’s parents 
had discovered intimate texts with John on her cellphone and 
reported them to the school, which fired John as a coach. His 
then-wife, who had recently given birth to their second son, 
kicked him out, and he slept in cars, hotels, and at friends’ 
houses. His victim didn’t press charges until the end of 2013, 
when she was a freshman in college. According to John, she 
had a breakdown and her parents encouraged her to report 
him to law enforcement. He was arrested and sentenced to 
ten years with a suspended sentence after two, and ten years’ 
probation. 
Once in jail, John was placed in the medical wing on sui-
cide watch. Incarceration can be especially rough for those 
convicted of sex offenses, who he says are vilified within 
prisons more than any other group, but John weighed close 
to three hundred pounds and could bench 350, so nobody 
tried to fight him. After getting off suicide watch, he spent his 
time tutoring other inmates for the GED, and when he was 
released in 2016, he was looking forward to rebuilding his life.

But John had lost everything: his family, his job, his money, 
his car, his belongings. The first order of business was to buy 
clothes. His first set of probation stipulations prohibited him 
from going to a mall, or anywhere where teens congregate, 
so he stood around in his prison-discharge gym shorts, con-
templating all the small ways life would look different now, 
before heading to a Banana Republic.

Next on the list was housing. John says he was rejected 
from over a hundred apartments in Hartford—which isn’t 
unusual for individuals on the registry. State and federal hous-
ing subsidies explicitly deny eligibility to registered offenders. 
Private landlords are under no obligation to exclude people 
on the registry, but it doesn’t count as housing discrimination 
when they do. So John moved into a hotel. The Days Inn in 
Hartford is close enough to Bradley International Airport that 
he could hear the planes as they came and went. It was under 
construction at the time, which made the rooms cheaper. 
John describes it as the kind of place where kids would go 
after prom. He got to know the Indian family who owned it; 
they were friendly, and they would chat before he went out to 
the library in the mornings.

John arrived at the library at 9:25 a.m. so he could secure 
a computer when it opened at 9:30—the terms of his proba-
tion banned him from owning his own computer, and they 
required him to leave the library in the afternoons when 
school got out, because, like the mall, it was somewhere 
teens came to hang out. When he first got out of prison, the 
only children he was allowed to spend time with were his 
own. John says he applied to hundreds of jobs, and “a lot of 
people said no. Everybody said no. It was hell.” Eventually, 
somebody said yes, and he started working at a warehouse, 
preparing bulk food shipments to send to supermarkets. Then 
another yes, and he got a job with a local newspaper. He was 
promoted, he passed his polygraph, and his probation restric-
tions started to ease up. He found an apartment in Hartford 
through a sympathetic building manager who had served 
three years himself, and he moved out of the hotel. Things 
were looking up.

Then the paper fired him—journalism was so public and 
he was too much of a liability—and he was back to the job 
search. The offense would come up in different ways during 
interviews. Sometimes they would notice the gap in his work 
experience while he’d been incarcerated and would ask for 
an explanation. Sometimes they would inquire about a back-
ground check. Sometimes it was at the very end, when they 
asked if there was anything else they should know. “I got in 
trouble,” John would tell them. “A couple of years ago when 
I was running this fencing program I had an inappropriate 
relationship with a high school senior…it was a dark period 
of my life.” 
At Voya Financial, a personal finance company, his inter-
viewers had told him they didn’t think it would affect how he 
did the job, so they invited him back for an aptitude test. The 
HR person told him that he had gotten the first ten she had 
ever seen. He got an offer. “I was really excited,” he says, “I 
could wear suits again.” They did a background check, then 
sent him his paperwork. He set up his health insurance. Two 
weeks later, he got a call: they couldn’t hire him after all. 
“There’s no coming back from it,” he says, “You’re the mon-
ster.”

Now, John’s sons—three and six—are growing up without 
him. The little one is built “like a brick house,” the kind 
of kid, he says, who could “take your lunch money by just 
looking at you.” The older one is sweet; he takes care of his 
brother. John hasn’t seen his mother—who has been diag-
nosed with Alzheimer’s—in nearly six years. His ex-wife isn’t 
speaking to him. Neither are most of his friends: only two 
had come to visit him in prison, and his social life didn’t get 
much better after his release. He was banned from fencing. 
And making new friends is almost impossible: you can’t make
