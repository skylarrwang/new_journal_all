Research Center estimate that sixty-three percent of sexual 
assaults are never reported). I face green-eyed, well-spoken 
Scott across the table and think: you are a person, and you did 
a horrible, horrible thing.

The question of policy reform opens itself up to many 
more abstract questions. Is punishment the only real form 
of accountability? Is it possible to wade through the murk of 
shame and fear to have better conversations about sex and 
sexual violence? Do we believe that people can change?

My personal answers to these questions were tested on the 
morning of a Sentencing Commission hearing. Cindy Prizio, 
the founder and director of Connecticut for One Standard of 
Justice (CTOSJ), an organization that advocates for the rights 
of those on the registry called, had put me in touch with Vin-
nie, one of the guys she worked with. Vinnie offered to give 
me a ride to Hartford.  It was a generous offer: he lived in 
Waterbury and it would take him nearly three hours to swing 
by New Haven to pick me up and drop me off. I hesitated: 
getting into a car with somebody convicted of a sex offense 
seemed high on the list of things I’d been warned in girlhood 
not to do. But wasn’t I setting out to counter those fears and 
misconceptions? I accepted, thanked him, and agreed that 
we’d text about timing in the morning.

All I knew about Vinnie, besides the fact that he was on 
the registry, was that he worked at Stop and Shop, had a son, 
drove a pick-up truck, and laughed easily when we talked 
on the phone. I was sure, I told myself, that the ride would 
be just fine. But for peace of mind, I decided to look him 
up, hoping that he, like many people on the registry, would 
be a non-violent offender. As it turned out, Vinnie had been 
convicted of first degree assault in 2002. The appeal, which 
was struck down by the Connecticut Court of Appeals, was 
available online. I read the fifteen pages graphically describ-
ing how he’d raped his high school friend at their twentieth 
reunion. I felt physically ill. I couldn’t bring myself to get in 
a car with him. In the morning, I texted that I was feeling 
sick. “I’m sorry to hear that,” he wrote back. “Hope you feel 
better soon.” 

I’m sure that nothing bad would’ve happened had I driven 
to Hartford with Vinnie. He’d been convicted fifteen years 
before, and I knew that offenders who’d been on the registry 
for over ten years were extremely unlikely to be dangerous. 
But this tension between how we feel and what we rationally 
know is at the core of our misperceptions and our policies.

The question here isn’t exactly whether we forgive Scott 
and Vinnie and other violent offenders. As Hartford public 
defender Tejas Bhatt points out, there are only two choices: 
“Either we decide to give all these people life sentences or 
we figure out how to reintegrate them into our communities.” 
Scott has been out of prison for eleven years. The night he 
committed the offense was the last time he ever drank. His 
record since then has been clean in every way. But the regis-
try made him the target of harassment, made his job search 
at least as difficult as John’s, and plunged him into debt. He 
says inclusion on the registry is “still a sentence. It’s keeping 
me from living life, getting a job, making money.”

Scott and John think of themselves as the lucky ones: they 
both have homes, advanced degrees, and some hope for their 
futures. Other offenders slip more completely through the 
cracks. There’s a man in my neighborhood who, after doing 
research for this piece, I now recognize from the registry; 
I see him often in the late afternoons, collecting cans in a 
clear garbage bag. I try to make eye contact with him, but he 
keeps his head down. A man named Tim told me about his 
difficulty accessing welfare services after his release, because 
these services—like the free eye-care clinic he’d wanted to 
visit—were housed in churches, which probation prevented 
him from entering.  “I can’t see without these,” he says, jam-
ming his finger at the thin, rectangular, tortoiseshell glasses 
that sit prominently on his nose. “How can we expect people 
to be law abiding citizens if I can’t even get glasses?” A man 
who identified himself as “Bob” testified to the Sentencing 
Commission that “being a sex offender in Connecticut is a 
death sentence…I sit in my apartment or take long walks to 
Scott Schwartz at his parents’ home.

pass the days. With no hope what else can I do? What else 
could anyone do?”


E
very state has a sex offender registry—there are about 
861,500 people registered nationally—and from coast 
to coast, people are starting to talk about their scope, 
efficacy, and collateral consequences. Alissa Ackerman, a sex 
crimes policy expert at California State University, who is 
both a survivor of sexual violence and an advocate for pol-
icy change, believes in better alternatives. Like Bhatt and the 
folks at CTOSJ, she thinks that laws about registration and 
residency restrictions are counterproductive: “The public 
is so outraged that someone would commit this harm that 
they will stand beside them, even though research shows that 
these laws don’t make us any safer,” she says, then adds: “Do 
you want to feel safe or do you want to be safe?”  

Ackerman was raped when she was sixteen. She barely 
made it through high school and then dropped out of college 
after her first semester. She’d been a biology major, an aspir-
ing doctor, and a walk-on to the softball team on full schol-
arship, but by the time Thanksgiving rolled around she was 
drinking too much and spiraling out of control. At the time, 
she said, she thought of the man who raped her as a monster. 
But when she made it back to Florida State University and 
took her first class in human behavior, she started to wonder 
what had happened to him that would lead him to cause this 
sort of pain to another human being.

Instead of treating sex offenses as a criminal justice prob-
lem, we might look at them as a public health issue. Offend-
ers rarely have the opportunity to sit face to face with their 
victim so they can understand the repercussions of their 
actions. Ackerman is piloting what she calls a “vicarious 
restorative justice” program in California (as a survivor, not 
a researcher), where survivors sit down with perpetrators of 
other people’s sexual assaults. At this point, she has talked 
with over two hundred perpetrators: she says this allows her 
to be “kind and compassionate and also tough” and to “chal-
lenge them in ways their treatment providers can’t.” Once, 
she says, she assumed the position of a man who had served 
twenty years for a violent rape. She used her experience to 
say: “This is what you did to me.” By the end, they were both 
crying. “I realize I could have been your perpetrator and you 
could have been my victim,” she remembers him saying, 
“and I am so sorry for the harm that I have caused you.” 

Scott’s victim testified at his trial, which helped him in 
therapy, he says, because it made him understand the extent 
of the harm that he caused. When he heard her speak about 
nightmares, night sweats, panic attacks, and relationship 
problems, he thought: I did that. He thought: How could you 
trust somebody if someone came in the night?  “I know I 
affected you in all these ways,” he wrote in an unsent letter-
to-the-victim that was part of his therapy program. “If I could 
take it back, I would.”

C
indy Prizio, the director of CTOSJ, drives me to the 
First Congregational Church in Guilford, where we 
set up for a screening of Untouchable, a documen-
tary about people on the registry that tries to capture perspec-
tives of both victims and perpetrators. In 2015, one of Cindy’s 
close family members was convicted of sexual assault, lead-
ing to his incarceration and registration. That was when she 
started to learn about the world of sex offender laws and threw 
herself into the advocacy that might be able to change them. 
Her cause is unpopular both in policy circles and in public 
imagination. “You’ve got the ugliest baby in the orphanage,” 
Cindy remembers someone saying to her. But she’s fighting 
for that baby with everything she’s got.

CTOSJ has been holding meetings, doing outreach, and 
rallying supporters to testify at hearings, but this screening is 
their first ever public event. By 
the time we start, about twen-
ty-five people—some support-
ers of the organization, some 
Guilford church-goers—have 
filtered in.   

After the movie, Reverend 
Ginger opens up the discus-
sion. At first, everyone is more 
or less in agreement: Bhatt, 
the public defender, calls the 
laws “out of hand” and says 
he doesn’t “know what we get 
from putting people on a pub-
lic registry.”  Vivien Blackford, 
from the Sentencing Commis-
sion, says that these require-
ments couldn’t exist “if people 
thought of sex offenders as 
human beings.” A couple of 
men on the registry weigh in 
with their experiences. We talk 
about the difficulty of finding 
employment and securing housing, the absurdity the stan-
dard conditions of probation, like not being allowed to use a 
computer, and the mandatory fees for treatment, polygraphs, 
and monitoring software that often plunge struggling ex-of-
fenders into debt.

Then Cindy says that victims have too much power in 
the legal proceedings in the state of Connecticut, and that 
is when—as she will refer to the discussion in the car on our 
way back—things start to get “vigorous.” Community mem-
bers fire back. Bhatt says legislation that doesn’t take the 
victim’s perspective into account won’t win, and it won’t be 
right. A woman named Karen, who is both a survivor of sex-
ual violence and an advocate for a family member on the reg-
istry, agrees with him. Suddenly everyone is picking a side. 
Cindy’s leg is trembling and Maria—who has a son on the 
registry—is shaking her fist. Reverend Ginger tries to calm 
things down by speaking over the commotion: “Those on the 
registry and those who have been abused, both have had their 
lives ruined.”

J
ohn says that everyone has their “but it’s you” moment. 
For him, it was at his old friend Caroline’s house. Her 
ten-year-old daughter was climbing all over his broad 
shoulders, as she had all her life. “Caro,” John said, turning 
to her, “What would you do if you didn’t know me, and you 
heard someone like me moved in next door?” 

She said she would look into it, that she would want to 
know what the situation was. 

“Caro, really?” John asked, grinning. “You’re telling me 
you wouldn’t be there with the pitchforks trying to burn my 
house down?”

“But it’s you,” she said.

Perpetrators of sexual vio-
lence are our coaches and 
neighbors and friends from 
high school. They are our 
sons and our boyfriends and 
our childhood playmates. We 
might be the victims of their 
assaults, or someone we love 
might be, or someone we 
know, or someone we’ve never 
met. The moment we recog-
nize that they are our people 
is when we start to see them 
as people. 

I think if I had gotten in 
the car with Vinnie, we would 
have had a good conversation. 
We might’ve cracked jokes. I 
might have liked him. I might 
have 
thought 
about 
how 
much time had passed since 
his offense, or that people can change, or that I almost always 
believe in second chances. I probably would’ve felt the futil-
ity and the injustice of the registry system as I learned about 
his obstacles to community reintegration after his release 
from prison. And all the while I would have hated that he 
raped somebody, and hated that sexual violence happens.  Every so often, there would be a lapse in conversation, and I 
would look at his face or out the window, and we would con-
tinue along the highway, towards Hartford, and the hearing, 
and hopefully, something better.
