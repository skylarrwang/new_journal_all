In December 2017, the Connecticut Sentencing Commission proposed improvements to state policy regarding people convicted of sex offenses.  The commission investigated sentencing, risk assessment, registration requirements, and victim needs.  Thomas Ullmann hopes the state will take action to change sex offender laws nationwide.



U.S. state sex offender registries, created in 1994, were initially intended to be administrative, accessible only to law enforcement. The Jacob Wetterling Act, named after an abducted and murdered boy, mandated their creation.



Over nearly twenty-five years, these laws have become more punitive.  Congress passed several laws, all named for abused and murdered children, increasing registration time, broadening information, and making registries public.  The lack of registries for other crimes is highlighted.



The discrepancy between stranger-danger offenses informing registry laws and the more prevalent assaults by acquaintances is noted. RAINN statistics show that most victims know their perpetrators.  Ullmann argues that the registry is counterproductive to public safety.



Even Patty Wetterling, who lobbied for the registries, has become a critic, stating that anger drove the legislation. Ira Ellman points to a false statistic cited in a Supreme Court ruling regarding high recidivism rates, which is contradicted by studies showing rates between 2 and 5 percent.



The Sentencing Commission's interim report considers that these laws may not prevent recidivism and may do more harm than good.  The commission's draft proposal suggests switching from an offense-based to a risk-based registry, dividing offenders into low, moderate, and high-risk categories.



The proposal faces an uphill battle, despite some state supreme court cases declaring probation stipulations unconstitutional.  Drastically reducing the public registry would alleviate barriers to housing and employment. The registry encompasses a diverse range of offenses.



The Connecticut Sentencing Commission's proposal is described as a compromise, criticized by both offenders' families and victims' rights advocates.  Offenders' families feel it doesn't go far enough, while victims' advocates have mixed reactions.



Donna Palomba, a rape survivor, testified to the Sentencing Commission, urging them to remember the victim's experience.  She discusses the trauma of rape and the societal misconceptions about victim behavior.  Her perpetrator was identified through a DNA test eleven years later and later raped another underage girl.



Donna founded Jane Doe No More, an organization dedicated to improving societal perceptions of survivors. The organization runs programs to train first responders and help survivors share their stories.  Donna believes victim involvement in the legal process is crucial.



While Donna believes the sex offender registry is important, she also acknowledges its limitations and potential for reform, suggesting a less harsh approach for consensual relationships between teens.  She emphasizes the need for decisions based on sound information and research.



**Title: Scott's Story**
**Page number(s): 32-33**

Scott Schwartz, from a difficult childhood in the Bronx, describes his life leading up to an attempted rape.  He was an "all-American kid" at the University of Las Vegas but lost his job, had a rocky relationship, and drank excessively. One night, while drunk, he attempted to rape his neighbor.



In retrospect, Scott understands his actions as an attempt to control another person due to his own feelings of loss of control. He also acknowledges the sexual component, the desire for connection, even if fake.  The author reflects on her position as a journalist interviewing a perpetrator of sexual assault, and the pervasive realities of sexual objectification and assault faced by women.
