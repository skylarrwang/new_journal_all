THE  NEW  JOURNAL
has led the Gallery with a blend of personal warmth and 
a firm belief in its cause, proselytizing on the power of the 
Gallery’s art and the importance of its educational mission.

Beginning in the early two-thousands, administrators 
asked students to put on programming and help configure 
rooms. “Students didn’t give us a bad suggestion, ever,” 
Reynolds told me. Students began co-curating exhibitions 
and recommended that the Gallery have a homey lobby 
space, which explains the curvy green chairs and spongy 
grey couches. Reynolds hopes that close engagement with 
students will teach them to think visually and innovatively. 
“You want to pass on your knowledge to younger people,” 
he said, so that they can “outdo you in every respect.”

Pausing in the main lobby of the Gallery, Reynolds re-
flects on the acuity of the architectural juxtaposition of Le-
Witt’s paintings and Louis Kahn’s windows. His voice lifts 
with raw zeal as he turns to me. “You’re here now. This mu-
seum is here with an incredible collection. And it’s yours! 
It’s here for you all!” His face is earnest and insistent, and 
for the moment I am totally sold, my skin prickling from 
the force of his democratic proclamation.

R
eynolds grew up in Davis, California, where his 
mother was a botanist and his father was a microbi-
ologist teaching at the University of California, Da-
vis. He always liked making things: he remembers building 
cages and hen houses as a child, and had a miniature tool 
bench next to his dad’s. As a teenager at Phillips Academy 
in Andover, Massachusetts, he began to learn about art, 
studying the Josef Albers-Bauhaus school and frequently 
retreating to the Addison Gallery, Andover’s American art 
museum, to do his classwork. In between assignments, he 
enjoyed getting lost in famous American paintings.

But it wasn’t until he joined the inaugural class of UC 
Santa Cruz that Reynolds began developing his own ar-
tistic practice. As a senior influenced by visiting artists 
from the experimental Fluxus school, his work included 
a toothbrush with real teeth for bristles. After graduation, 
he enrolled in the MFA program at the UC Davis. There, 
his artwork explored biological life cycles, and he crafted 
process-oriented, ephemeral work using plants he grew on 
a small farm. In 1973, fresh out of graduate school, Reyn-
olds joined the faculty of San Francisco State University. 
Over the next decade, he directed the University’s Center 
for Experimental and Interdisciplinary Art and delved into 
theatre, designing sets for plays and dance performances.

The nineteen-seventies, Reynolds says, was “a very 
yeasty and creative decade,” and living in California, he 
soon found himself in the thick of it all. He met Suzanne 
Hellmuth, a dancer, choreographer, and performance art-
ist from Oberlin, while designing a set for a show she was 
involved with. The young couple married in 1977, after 
helping found 80 Langton Street, an alternative arts space 
in a defunct casket factory in San Francisco. The arts scene 
there was still small enough that most people knew each 
other, and the theatre, music and visual arts communities 
melded together. With institutional support hard to come 
by, the young artists worked day jobs—anything from teach-
ing to carpentry—and collaborated in their studios, sharing 
space, resources, and ideas. Their scrimping soon paid off: 
by the late nineteen-seventies, Reynolds’ and Hellmuth’s 
work was being shown in galleries on the East Coast and 
in Europe.

In the early nineteen-eighties, Reynolds entered museum 
administration as director of the Washington Project for the 
Arts, an alternative art space in D.C. Richard J. Powell, who 
was the WPA’s director of programs during Reynolds’s last 
years there and now teaches art and art history at Duke Uni-
versity, says that at the WPA, Reynolds fostered a “collabora-
tive, intellectually stimulating, and fun environment.”

After six years in Washington, Reynolds was recruited 
to return to the museum he had loved as a teenager, this 
time as its director. Over the next decade running Andover’s 
Addison Gallery, Reynolds oversaw what he later called a 
“mini version” of the expansion he would lead at Yale. Un-
der Reynolds’s leadership, the Addison Gallery’s annual vis-
itation numbers jumped from ten thousand to around six-
ty-five thousand, the collection and endowment grew, and 
community outreach programming expanded. Reynolds 
gained practice fundraising from a wealthy alumni pool, 
bringing in new art, and coordinating extensive outreach 
programs—all tasks he would scale up and master at Yale. 
Allison Kemmerer, a curatorial assistant at the Addison 
during Reynolds’ time, describes Reynolds as someone who 
routinely thinks big, and with so much enthusiasm that his 
ambitious plans actually become possible. Sometimes, this 
meant persuading colleagues to embark on projects they 
weren’t entirely sure of. Even today, in the offices of the 
Addison, the term “Jockism” is playfully used to refer to the 
act of onboarding someone before they quite know what 
they are getting themselves into.

By the mid-nineteen-nineties, former University Presi-
dent Richard Levin began lobbying Reynolds to come to 
Yale. Since 1995, Levin had been putting together a master 
plan to renovate the art gallery. One of the Gallery’s build-
ings was partially roofless, and Levin hoped to renovate and 
expand its facilities. He had heard about Reynolds’ work at 
the Addison; Reynolds remembers Levin telling him, “This 
is what we need in New Haven—come on down!” Reyn-
olds already had some friends at Yale, including then-Dean 
of Yale College Dick Brodhead, who had been a year ahead 
of Reynolds at Andover, when he signed on as Director in 
1998. Between 2004 and 2012 all three buildings were reno-
vated, Reynolds proudly reports, “without closing the muse-
um for a single day.” Today, Reynolds takes evident delight 
in pointing out the high-tech hidden ventilation system in 
the Chapel Street building, which heats and cools the John 
Trumbull paintings that formed the Gallery’s founding col-
lection in 1832.

Reynolds has also overseen huge expansions in the scope 
of the Gallery’s permanent collections, helping to create 
new departments in Photography, African Art, and Indo-Pa-
cific Art. Ruth Barnes, who has been the Curator of In-
do-Pacific Art since the department was established in 2010, 
describes Reynolds as an exceptionally supportive director, 
albeit one with high expectations. They worked closely to-
gether when the department recently decided to accept a 
large donation of Indonesian puppets, which, Barnes told 
me, “with one stroke makes the Yale Art Gallery the world’s 
leading center for Indonesian performance studies.” Barnes 
also noted that Reynolds expects his curators to work closely 
with donors and to accommodate their wishes. “He would 
land like a ton of bricks” on a curator who failed to do so, 
Barnes said. Although she is frustrated at times by ego-driv-
en donors, Barnes thinks Reynolds’s emphasis on patronage 
helps the Gallery stay relevant. 

All four exhibitions opening in March pay homage to 
Reynolds, three of them for his personal relationships with 
the artists. Pamela Franks was working in Joel Shapiro’s 
studio in the nineteen-nineties when Reynolds visited the 
sculptor for an exhibition, and she remembers his attentive 
interest in the artist and his craft. Reynolds spent hours in 
Shapiro’s studio and digging through storage to look at old 
work, beginning a friendship that decades later has brought 
Shapiro’s work to the Gallery. Now a curator of Modern 
and Contemporary Art at the Gallery, Franks is curating 
“Joel Shapiro: Plaster, Paper, Wood, and Wire,” which 
builds on the Shapiro exhibition Reynolds originally curat-
ed and includes sculptures the artist made in response to 
that earlier work. Franks values the Gallery’s focus on the 
primacy of artists, which she says is a key part of Reynolds’s 
legacy: his emphasis on “the creative impulse, the ideas, 
and the generative aspect of what artists do.” Besides Sha-
piro, there will also be exhibitions of wall drawings by Sol 
LeWitt, sculpture by Reynolds’s beloved grad-school men-
tor Manuel Neri, and photographs and other art of the ruins 
of Pompeii. 

eynolds’s commitment to making art available to a 
broad audience has led him to speak up when polit-
ical debates have questioned whether controversial 
artwork should be shown freely. In 1989, towards the end 
of his time directing the Washington Project for the Arts, 
Reynolds made a decisive move in a moment of national 
controversy. Afraid of losing federal funding, the Corcor-
an Gallery of Contemporary Art in D.C. had backed out 
of showing a Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective that con-
gressional Republicans were calling “lewd” and “indecent.” 
Reynolds led the WPA in providing a space for the show. 
Thirty years later, he still gets fired up about the “culture 
wars.” “That was the easiest decision,” he told me. Map-
plethorpe had died of AIDS earlier that year, and Reynolds 
still has a bone to pick with the politicians who wanted to 
censor the artwork for what he viewed as homophobic rea-
sons.

Now, Reynolds is speaking out against censorship from 
a different angle. In late January, when the National Gal-
lery of Art indefinitely postponed a Chuck Close exhibition

following allegations that the artist sexually harassed some 
of his models, Reynolds weighed in once again. Quoted in 
The New York Times as the leader of an institution that col-
lects Close’s work, Reynolds argued that the artwork should 
not be withheld from public view. He reflected that Picas-
so’s work is freely shown in spite of his deplorable histo-
ry with women. “If that goes too far,” Reynolds told me, 
“there’s a lot of stuff that’s going to be taken out of cultural 
discussion and display,” adding that he thinks things might 
be getting “a little bit out of control.” But Reynolds, who is 
a friend of Close’s, encouraged criticism of artists’ behavior 
and said he thinks it is important to situate their work in the 
context of their lives. 

On the eve of his retirement, Reynolds is bringing in a 
large gift of drawings from Sol LeWitt, another artist friend. 
Three floors above the teaser drawing in the Gallery’s lob-
by, graduate students study certificates to install “Sol Le-
Witt Wall Drawings: Expanding a Legacy,” an exhibition 
opening March 2. Reynolds asks one student, who has just 
added a very long graphite line to a grid covering one huge 
wall, why the work interests her. She loves the physicality 
of it, she tells our assembly of onlookers haltingly. It’s clear 
that she’s a bit shaken by the sudden audience: Reynolds 
has a habit of putting people on the spot like this, catching 
them unawares but giving them a flattering stage. He picks 
up when she stops talking, to sing praises of such serious 
student involvement in the Gallery. “He’s made 1,350 of 
these,” Reynolds marvels, “none of which look the same. 
He just keeps finding ways to innovate.” Reynolds asks an-
other assistant to read out the words of this wall’s certificate, 
for all to hear.
