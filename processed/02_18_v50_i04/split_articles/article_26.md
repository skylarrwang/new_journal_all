checked to make sure he was out of earshot, then leaned in, 
like she was telling a bawdy secret: “Actually, I was a secre-
tary. Not an accountant.” She winked. “But don’t tell him 
that.”


I 
first heard of Joe from Matteo Rosati, my friend and 
former roommate. Matteo is from Rome. In Italian, his 
surname means of a pink hue. Given his propensity to 
sunburn, the description is accurate. The fall of Matteo’s 
freshman year, his mother Federica came to New Haven for 
move-in. While Matteo was at orientation, she found herself 
with nothing to do. So she went to the hairdresser. As she 
waited for an appointment, she overheard a Yale student ask 
for Joe Moscato. “Students come here?” she wondered. Then 
she thought of Matteo. She asked for Joe too. 
“From that moment, I don’t know why…he was so open, 
I told him my life story. No—I’m kidding. But I told him a 
lot,” she said over the phone from Rome. “I was a bit tragic.”


Joe remembered her crying in the salon chair. (“Don’t say 
crying,” he told me, eyeing my scribbles appraisingly. “Say 
she was upset. She was upset her seventeen-year-old son was 
leaving for school in America.”) “So I said to her in Italian, 
‘Don’t worry. I’ll take care of him.’” (Matteo says Joe’s Italian 
sounds a little old-fashioned, like a relic of his parents’ emi-
gration to America from Sicily and Naples in the early 1900s.) 
At first, Federica didn’t believe him. “I really thought he saw 
a desperate woman and was only being kind,” she said. But 
she gave him Matteo’s number.


Joe followed through. He stored Matteo’s books and clothes 
for the summer, had him over for dinner, and took him to buy 
a bike. When Matteo later fell off that bike and shattered his 
ankle, Joe was the third person he called, after his roommates 
and 911. And when Federica came to New Haven to help 
Matteo recover, Joe cooked for them. “I really like this idea a 
lot,” was the first thing she told me on the phone from Rome. 
“Writing an article about Joe. He deserves it.”

oe finished applying the treatment to Nancy’s hair, held 
up by clips above her scalp like a tulip bud. He set a 
timer, got her a magazine, and sat down to wait. I asked 
what he thinks makes him successful. “To be in this business, 
you have to a) like people, and b) like the work,” he says. “It’s 
a relationship. My clients become part of my family.”
