non-profit organization in New Canaan that contributed to 
the development of Public Act No. 16-71. With the help of 
anti-trafficking organizations Polaris Project and EPCAT, an 
international network that began as the campaign to End 
Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, Marriott International 
developed a hotel employee training program on human 
trafficking in 2011. Quinnipiac Law School professor Sheila 
Hayre had mostly worked against labor trafficking before she 
got involved, but she stepped up to ensure that the Connecti-
cut hotel and motel trainings were run effectively. Since 
then, Hayre and her team of over thirty Quinnipiac student 
volunteers have become the vehicle for these trainings.
Hayre estimates that since last January, they’ve organized 
ten sessions for hotel employees across the state of Connecti-
cut. The Quinnipiac Human Trafficking Prevention Proj-
ect workshops follow the Marriott curriculum, but the law 
students attempt to incorporate local examples when they 
can. (They typically have to explain, for example, why hotels 
and motels along Connecticut’s I-95 corridor are so prone 
to becoming sites of trafficking.) Additionally, the student 
organizers gather a panel of four or five experts—from law 
enforcement, the DCF, or anti-trafficking organizations—to 
answer hotel and motel employees’ questions at the end of 
each training session.

Since beginning their workshops, the Quinnipiac team 
has found it most effective to reach out to hotels and motels 
and deliver the trafficking awareness trainings on site. This 
approach has had success thus far, but Hayre is unsure if 
they will ever be able to train every lodging worker in the 
state with this approach. “Honestly, I don’t think we’ve even 
touched the tip of the iceberg,” she said.
Sarah Washburn, an employee of the Connecticut Lodg-
ing Association and the association’s representative on the 
Connecticut TIP Council, echoed Hayre. “The general reac-
tion has been challenging,” Washburn said. “The effort to 
get the training done by that date [October 1, 2017] has been 
hard for the industry.” When listing lodging properties’ train-
ing options in an interview, Washburn noted that many own-
ers ask their employees to simply read and sign informational 
materials. Others, she said, can send a representative to one 
of the Quinnipiac workshops and then have that representa-
tive review the curriculum with other employees when they 
return.

Sheila Hayre, however, believes Public Act No. 16-71 
forbids businesses from sending a representative who will 
subsequently train other staff members—and she expressed 
concern that this misunderstanding could actually have dan-
gerous consequences. “It’s kind of horrifying that people are 
thinking, ‘We can send a rep and have that happen,’” Hayre 
said. “Trafficking is an elusive, very difficult-to-define topic, 
so we do not want folks who are not well-versed around traf-
ficking issues to be dealing with this.”

**The Dangers of Vigilante Justice in Human Trafficking**
**Page number(s): 14**

I
n 2011, Shelia Fredrick, a flight attendant for Alaska Air-
lines, noticed something off about a girl in a window seat. 
The teenager had a bruise on her leg, was traveling with a 
much older man, and looked distressed. Fredrick knew some-
thing wasn’t right. She decided to intervene.
While the man was looking away, Fredrick caught the girl’s 
attention and mouthed to go to the bathroom, where she had 
left paper and a pen. When Fredrick later checked the bath-
room, she found a note: “I need help.” The flight attendant 
immediately alerted the captain, and law enforcement offi-
cials arrived at the airport before the flight landed.
A BuzzFeed article about Fredrick’s intervention went viral 
in 2017, with thousands of people applauding the flight atten-
dant for her quick thinking. But Sheila Hayre sometimes tells 
this story in trafficking awareness trainings as an example of 
exactly what not to do.
“We actually point out that that’s extremely dangerous—
both to yourself, the people around you, the people you work 
with, but also to the victim,” Hayre said. “While you want to 
engage in vigilante justice, and you really want to help these 
folks, you can actually endanger them.” If the adult male traf-
ficker had found Fredrick’s note, Hayre explained, he could 
have reacted violently. Furthermore, many victims of sexual 
trafficking, at the time of their exploitation, do not see them-
selves as victims and instead think of their traffickers as their 
boyfriends.

But while the Quinnipiac Law School trainings discour-
age workers from pursuing vigilante justice, they still discuss 
myriad examples of what hotel and motel workers should rec-
ognize as signs of trafficking. Then, they say, the most appro-
priate response is to let law enforcement handle it.
“What I tell folks to pay attention to is the dynamics 
between the adult and the minor, or sometimes what they 
think is a young adult. Does the situation seem to be very 
controlling? Is the adult doing all the talking? Are they 
attempting to secure a hotel room with cash [and] without 
identification?” said Tammy Sneed, who has served as an 
expert panelist.
The trainings also emphasize that trafficking awareness 
must be a collaborative effort between staff members in dif-
ferent roles. “When you’re cleaning staff, and you’re going 
into a hotel room, and you’re supposedly renting to a father 
“While you want to 
engage in vigilante 
justice, and you really 
want to help these folks, 
you can actually 
endanger them.”
and his two daughters, and you see sex toys or you see lubri-
cant all over the place, that to me is a huge red flag,” Sneed 
said. “If you’re working at the front desk, and you have a room 
that keeps renting pornography, and again you’re supposed 
to have a family staying in a particular room, that would be 
a concern.” Many hotel and motel employees are afraid of 
reporting a client and being incorrect, but communicating 
with other employees about their observations often empow-
ers them to call the authorities.

And reporting a potential instance of trafficking in Con-
necticut is as easy as that—just placing a phone call. This 
procedure ensures law enforcement is involved early on, and 
deters unqualified “vigilantes” from intervening counterpro-
ductively. Once lodging employees call the Connecticut 
trafficking tip line or local police, their responsibilities are 
supposedly fulfilled. “You need to err on the side of caution. 
Because mistakes will be made, but the trick is, they don’t 
have to be made by you. Your job is to report,” Hayre said.
Hotel and motel employees have been receptive at the 
trafficking awareness trainings thus far, and many have been 
shocked by how pertinent the issue of trafficking is in Con-
necticut. After hearing about sexual trafficking on Backpage, 
one property owner visited the website to see for himself. He 
was devastated to find an advertisement that featured a photo 
of an underage girl being trafficked in his own hotel. The 
trafficker had already vacated the room by this point, but the 
property owner’s sense of immunity was shattered. He swore 
to be more vigilant in the future.

Despite these moments of success, anti-trafficking advo-
cates are still weighing how to bring about widespread 
enforcement of Public Act No. 16-71. Because the bill’s train-
ing initiative has no funding—and there have been no legal 
consequences for properties that did not finish training by 
October 1, 2017—many advocates are shifting toward moral 
arguments. If most hotels now boast about being eco-friendly, 
why can’t they create a culture in which hotels also want to 
be openly anti-trafficking? Sheila Hayre thinks this may be an 
effective strategy in Connecticut, but she is not hopeful about 
the replicability of the training mandate in other states. “In 
larger states…I just can’t imagine how they’d be able to do 
this without funding. Already it’s quite difficult to do it with 
all the traveling, and [Connecticut is] quite a small state.”
Tammy Sneed recognizes Public Act No. 16-71’s lack of 
teeth, but the HART team is dedicated to making the bill 
work, even if progress is slower than expected. “In a perfect 
world, we would have some money to make it easier to imple-
ment,” she said. “But we can’t just be dependent on that, 
because the reality is money’s not out there. And the crimi-
nals are out there making money.”
