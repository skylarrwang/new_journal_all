For two decades, Jock Reynolds has led the YUAG by the force of his personality
A
n expansive circle composed of intersecting lines 
levitates on a wall in the lobby of the Yale University 
Art Gallery. Close up, specks of white emerge from 
blackness like stars in a compacted night sky. Jock Reynolds 
will explain to anyone who walks into the Gallery that this 
wall drawing by Sol Lewitt includes ten-thousand straight 
black lines and ten-thousand not-straight black lines. Reyn-
olds, who was a longtime friend of LeWitt’s, told me that 
each of LeWitt’s drawings comes with a “certificate” that “is 
a little bit like a musical score,” conducting the artists who 
execute the piece. Last December, the final not-straight 
lines were drawn by visitors invited to participate in the cul-
mination of the installation. 
On a January afternoon, Reynolds, the director of the 
museum, walks through its galleries with a swift, easy gait. 
He calls out animated greetings to passing curators and the 
security guards standing watch in the corners of the rooms. 
At seventy, he is tall and broad, with neatly trimmed white 
hair and a big, flushed face. Speaking quickly and fervently, 
he packs his sentences with fine detail, diving into a narra-
tion of his time at the Gallery before I can ask him a ques-
tion. He moves excitedly from room to room, his warmth is 
accompanied by a sense of ownership: this three-building 
museum complex on Chapel Street is his masterpiece.
This spring, after two decades of leadership, Reynolds 
will step down as the director of the Gallery. Over the 
course of his tenure, he has led the museum’s transforma-
tion from a neglected institution with scattered holdings to 
a world-class collection of art displayed in elegantly reno-
vated galleries. Under his tenure, the museum has added 
new departments, significantly increased its visitation, and 
solidified its status as a leading teaching museum. Today, 
the Gallery has 160 students involved in educational pro-
grams—as many as it has full-time employees. Reynolds
