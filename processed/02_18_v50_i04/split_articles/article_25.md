One morning in January, Joe Moscato and I shook 
hands for the first time. Five minutes later, he was 
drawing on my face.  “It’s all about having an eye to 
see where things belong,” he said, tilting my chin with one 
hand as he added an inch to my sideburns with a black eye 
pencil. Once he’d finished shading, Joe gestured along my 
cheekbone to show how a longer cut would accentuate my 
features. “It’s all about working with what you’ve got.”

I had to admit: I looked chiseled. 

Joe smiled over my shoulder into the salon mirror. His 
own hair, swept tall on top and buzzed thin on the sides, 
made his already long face seem longer. His round cheeks 
reddened as he smiled: a cherub with a pompadour. Joe is 
65. He was born at Yale-New Haven Hospital before they 
called it that. For nearly five decades, he’s manicured mops 
and manes from all over Connecticut. He cuts men and 
women. “Hair doesn’t have a sex,” he said. “Shake it in a 
bag. It’s still hair.” 

But Joe isn’t just a hairdresser. He’s the most famous New 
Havener you’ve never heard of. Some clients call him the 
Mayor. 

In 2007, Joe joined the Mane Room at the Omni Hotel on 
Temple Street, where he’s found a devoted following among 
boatloads of Yalies. That’s not just a figure of speech: he cuts 
hair for most of the heavyweight crew team. Bojan Dosljak 
’19 recommended him in the team’s group chat. Bojan has 
gone to Joe since his sophomore year. They have a pretty 
casual relationship, Bojan said, meeting once a month for a 
trim. But when Bojan, who’s from Serbia, had nowhere to go 
for Thanksgiving dinner, Joe invited him to his family’s gathering. “He’s always talking about his cooking,” Bojan said. “It 
was a really nice gesture.” 

Jonathan Green, a VP of Finance at the Yale-China Association, schedules his haircuts six months in advance. If you 
move a lot, he said, “the two most nerve-racking things are 
finding a dentist and a hairdresser.” When he moved to New 
Haven in 2011, he had to find both. Luckily, Joe was easy to 
find. Jonathan had moved into an apartment across the street 
from the salon. One day he walked in off the street and asked 
for an appointment. “Joe overhears, and he comes around 
the corner and says, ‘I cut your hair. Make the appointment 
with me,’” Jonathan recalled. “I loved it.” Since then, “I 
have not cheated on Joe once,” he said. “I have an enormous 
amount of trust in him. It’s a great relationship to have with 
a professional.” 

Joseph Giammittorio, who graduated from Yale in 2016, 
learned about Joe from his Big Sib in Jonathan Edwards. 
The first time they met, Joseph thought, “This man is New 
Haven. This guy can really go back and forth between all 
different kinds of communities.” “Plus,” Joseph said, “he’s got 
this Italian flair.” They met once a month, from freshman fall 
to senior spring. The appointments were “as much for the 
friendship as for the haircut.” 

A bell chimed at 10 a.m. as Joe’s first appointment of the 
day entered the salon, which smelled like a vanilla 
candle. She went straight to the salon seat next to 
mine. Joe tossed a black salon cape over her and started to 
comb out her short, grey-blonde hair. “How long have we 
known each other?”

Nancy thought about it. “About ten years.”

“More! I first cut your hair in 2004, 2005.” He turned to 
me. “When Nancy first came to me, she was an accountant.” 
She’d gone from accounting into real estate. Then she started 
a business with her son. (“He was a realtor for a hot second,” 
she expounded.) Somewhere along the way, her husband 
passed, Joe added. Throughout the synopsis, Nancy wore a 
flat grin, like she’s not used to having someone remember 
her story in such detail. “Now she’s a realtor herself!” Joe 
concluded. “How would you describe me?”

“Oh, you’re an absolute pro,” she said.

“She’s cheated on me, you know.”

“It’s true,” she grinned. “But nobody does a haircut like 
Joe.”

Joe went to get the paste for her hair treatment. She
