nineteen-thirties New York, a city dominated by a “master 
builder”—and Yale graduate—named Robert Moses who 
grafted major arteries like the Triborough Bridge and mod-
ernist behemoths like Lincoln Center onto the urban grid. 
By the time his family moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, 
four-year-old Newman was obsessed with sketching those 
structures. 

“This is a stretch, but if New Haven is Rome, then Water-
bury is Florence,” Newman said, remembering how he mar-
veled at the towns of the Naugatuck River Valley. Their grand 
city halls and railroad stations, built by men made rich by the 
Industrial Revolution, entranced him.

He enrolled in the Yale School of Architecture on the heels 
of Richard Lee’s 1954 election as mayor of New Haven. Lee 
would soon try his best Moses impersonation, razing “slums” 
with federal funds and replacing them with the Connector, 
the Chapel Square Mall, and the Elm Haven high-rises. Most 
city planners and urban architects welcomed these transfor-
mative projects—Newman’s professors were no different. 
Yale president A. Whitney Griswold commissioned renowned 
modernists like Eero Saarinen to design Ingalls Rink and 
Morse and Stiles residential colleges, while the University’s 
architecture professors praised the magnificence of marble 
cubes like the Beinecke Library. Newman’s teachers argued 
that the best buildings conquered their streets, proclaiming 
their uniqueness rather than fitting into a preexisting fabric. 
Newman learned those lessons on the fourth floor of one 
such building: Louis Kahn’s Yale University Art Gallery, 
where the architecture school used to be. Its entrance sits 
back from the street, perpendicular to and raised above the 
sidewalk. “That building had a profound effect upon me,” 
he said. “And, of course, Kahn was there as well.” Kahn’s 
experiments with “structure, mechanical systems, light, [and] 
space” amazed Newman. He learned to design and draw 
from the same men who were constructing “great cathedrals” 
all around him, testing how far they could go “with these 
aspirations to build to heaven.”

After graduating in 1959, Newman got a job with modern-
ist architect I. M. Pei, designer of the Louvre Pyramid and 
the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. He 
commuted between New York and New Haven, where he’d 
started a family. “I did that by train, early in the morning 
and back late at night,” he said. “The train was a great place 
to sleep, but it was [also] a great place to work and read.” In 
1961, while Newman had all that time to read, a book came 
out that would fundamentally reshape how he—and the 
entire architectural field—thought of cities. 

The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written 
by a little-known Greenwich Village author, Jane Jacobs. 
She called her work an “attack on current city planning and 
rebuilding,” one that denounced the buildings Newman had 
been trained to build as cold, distant, and fundamentally 
anti-urban. She thought planners and city officials like Moses 
in New York and Lee in New Haven were tearing down what
