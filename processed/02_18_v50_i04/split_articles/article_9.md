REMEMBRANCE DEFERRED
Over a century after the Civil War, a Connecticut town works to remember its slaves.

G
uilford, a town of twenty-thousand half an hour 
north of New Haven, is a place that loves its past. 
There are three historical societies, and in the 
town center, by the chocolatier and tea shop, historical 
markers nearly outnumber street signs. A lone soldier 
stands at the center of the town green, looming over the 
dog walkers and families. Tall and imposing, with a mus-
ket by his side, he is the centerpiece of an 1877 memorial 
dedicated to the town’s Civil War veterans. Until recently, 
there was no such memorial for the town’s slaves, who are 
buried beneath him. In Connecticut, slavery dates back 
to the mid-1600s, and though it’s hard to know when it 
reached Guilford, by the late 1700s there were around fifty 
slaves living there. For all that Guilford loves to remem-
ber, until not long ago, their slaves had been forgotten.

A few years ago, frustrated that the textbooks he used 
almost never mentioned Northern slavery, Dennis Cul-
liton, a history teacher at Adams Middle School in Guil-
ford, set out to unearth the stories of the town’s slaves. 
He dug through court documents, wills, and property 
archives, and eventually found records of over seventy 
slaves who had lived there. Two years ago, Culliton pre-
sented his findings to a local historical society. Afterwards, 
fellow resident Doug Nygren approached him with the 
idea of memorializing the slaves’ lives in stone. Nygren 
was inspired by a recent trip to Germany, where he had 
encountered a project by the artist Gunter Demnig that 
placed small memorials called stolpersteine (“stumbling 
stones”) outside the final residences of Jewish victims of 
the Holocaust. The project began in 1992 and has since 
grown beyond the bounds of Germany, with fifty-six thou-
sand stolpersteine installed in twenty-two European coun-
tries. 

Last year, Culliton, Nygren, and a few other Guilford 
residents founded the Witness Stones Project, which plans 
to install memorial stones each year and organize educa-
tional events to remind residents of the enslaved men and 
women who lived, labored, and died in their town. Now, 
three “stones” are scattered across the streets of Guilford, 
placed on the sites of three slaves’ homes––one outside 
the town hall, one outside the local bank, and one outside 
a historic house. The small brass squares fit smoothly into 
the brick sidewalk, shining faintly in daylight, hardly vis-
ible by night.

The project also enlisted the help of local eighth grad-
ers, who dedicated a month of their history curriculum 
this year to studying Culliton’s findings. Following a gen-
eral unit on slavery, they then wrote biographies of Guil-
ford’s slaves, almost all of whom had never been written 
about before. Guilford has about three-hundred eighth 
graders, and if the project continues, a new crop of stu-
dents will continue the project each year. At the installa-
tion ceremony for the first three stones this past Novem-
ber, eighth grader Theo Freeman read the biography he 
wrote about Candace, a slave who lived in Guilford in 
the late 1700s and worked as a baker. “Candace found a 
way to be her own person, even as a slave,” Theo said, 
speaking to the crowd of parents, students, and residents 
gathered on the Guilford Green. “She also wrote her own 
will, which most slaves didn’t do. Some people may think 
this is impossible, but she did it.”

One of the project’s aims is to show Guilford’s residents,
