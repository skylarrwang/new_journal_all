The Yale Center for British Art helps visitors 
engage critically with its collection


Zebra, a 1763 painting by George Stubbs, serves as the 
mascot of the Yale Center for British Art on shirts, 
mugs, and bumper stickers. But to Linda Fried-
laender, Senior Curator of Education, the Stubbs painting 
also embodies the YCBA’s recent shift toward a more crit-
ical perspective. “Before, we would talk about the story of 
how Queen Charlotte received the zebra from explorers in 
Africa, and what a gifted painter Stubbs was, and we’d talk 
about the painterly qualities of the work,” she explained. 
“But really, the zebra functions as a symbol of the imperial 
project of Britain, and hearing that [from one of the gradu-
ate students] gave me the chance to step back and consider 
all the paintings [in the collection] from that lens.”


In a seminar room off the museum’s lobby, Friedlander, 
who has worked at the YCBA since its opening in 1977, 
passes around copies of a news article to twenty-one under-
graduates. These are the YCBA Student Guides, a group 
of students selected to design tours and lead the public 
through the Center’s three-story collection. The article is 
about Therese Dreaming, a painting that depicts an ado-
lescent girl with legs spread apart and underwear revealed, 
housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “There’s a peti-
tion going around to either remove or further contextualize 
this painting by Balthus,” she says, holding up a print-out of 
the painting. “So what do you do? Let’s start there.” 


That question—critical and topical—is typical of the dis-
cussions at weekly Student Guide classes. The YCBA’s pri-
mary benefactor, Paul Mellon, envisioned the Center as a 
repository of “beautiful works of art for Yale students” when 
he presented his collection to the University in 1966. But 
as the analytical stance on “Britishness” has shifted focus 
toward the country’s imperial legacy, the Center has begun 
to rethink its engagement with the term. As part of that 
process, the YCBA’s Education Department has altered the 
Student Guide program to reflect a newly critical attitude 
toward Britain’s representation, both in the artwork and in 
the world at large.


On a recent January afternoon, Curator of Education 
and Academic Outreach Jennifer Reynolds-Kaye began 
another class with a presentation on “The British After-
lives of Pre-Columbian Art.” Framing the art of the pre-co-
lonial Americas through a British lens is unorthodox, but 
for Reynolds-Kaye, that’s the point. The usual confines 
of the imagined British empire don’t cut it here—British 
imperialism cleaves a wide fissure through world history, 
and, under the tutelage of the Education Department, the 
Guides are learning how to tell museum visitors about it.


The museum’s critical shift, Friedlaender thinks, 
was spurred by the wave of political activism that 
rocked American college campuses, including Yale, 
in 2015. Likening it to the current #MeToo movement, 
Friedlaender believes that “2015 was a time when students 
of color at Yale and around the country started breaking the 
silence around [colleges’] treatment of minority students.” 
Shortly thereafter, in early 2016, the YCBA closed to the 
public for extended building conservation. The closure 
period provided the staff with an opportunity to reevaluate 
the museum’s mission and vision with respect to the con-
cerns raised by the protests. In particular, the YCBA began 
to consider ways in which its collection could serve as a 
means of engaging with the legacies of slavery and impe-
rialism, not only for students, but for members of the New 
Haven community. Friedlaender said that programming 
involving New Haven residents, local schools, and profes-
sionals from other museums has transformed the timbre of 
the YCBA and diversified the demographics of the muse-
um’s visitors. 


With these new goals in mind, the museum reorganized 
its permanent collection for its 2016 reopening under the 
dictum “Britain in the World.” “It’s no longer just about 

British culture and history, stuck on a small island sand-
wiched between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea,” 
said Student Guide Jordan Schmolka, who has been in the 
program since 2016. “The YCBA is in the process of looking 
outward, redefining its mission and using its collection to 
address how Britain’s history has affected those beyond its 
borders.” To prompt this kind of thinking in the museum’s 
visitors, Schmolka and other Guides discuss why figures 
are depicted in certain positions or with particular lighting 
effects and how power is asserted through a work’s compo-
sition.


The art can be jarring, Friedlaender pointed out while 
describing a prominent eighteenth-century portrait 
of Elihu Yale. He sits at the center of the canvas, 
surrounded by other prominent men. At the right bottom 
corner, a Black slave waits, looking at his master. “That 
Black servant in the corner—he’s finely dressed, but there’s 
a collar and a padlock around his neck,” she observes. “He 
would have been locked up at night.” Focusing on formal 
details—like the appearance of the padlock as a represen-
tation of chattel bondage—helps students consider impe-
rialism, slavery, and race, while “show[ing] how Britain’s 
imperialist history pervades absolutely everything in the 
museum,” Schmolka says. Her own tour, “Paint It Black: A 
History of the Color,” focuses on the history of black pig-
mentation in the collection, and discusses the ways Black-
ness has been constructed in lockstep with racial alterity.


While Schmolka and Friedlaender agree that the col-
lection serves as a nexus for engaging with imperial leg-
acy, they also emphasize the complementary relevance of 
recent programming. Schmolka and Sonia Gadre, another 
Student Guide, noted the “Things of Beauty Growing” 
exhibition that closed last December, which explored how 
vessel traditions from the British Isles, China, and Korea 
came together in novel ways to birth contemporary British 
pottery. 


Students have been crucial in transforming the muse-
um’s approach to race and representation. Since 2014, the 
Guides have had a hand in shaping the YCBA’s collection 
by selecting a work on paper for acquisition through the 
John O’Brien Fund each year. Both initiatives are shifting 
attention from the dazzling metropolitan centers of the for-
mer British Empire to the margins, with an emphasis on 
the traces of colonial rule. To Gadre, the Student Guides 
are challenging the notion that the YCBA is antiquated and 
pretentious. “We are young and we are here to help you 
through the museum’s resources,” she said. “That in itself 
seems to turn the stereotype of stuffy old British art on its 
head.”
