It definitely wasn’t serving that role when Newman set up 
shop off Broadway in the nineteen-sixties. New Haven was 
struggling with poverty and crime, the fruits of urban renewal 
and deindustrialization. Yale had built most of the residential 
colleges in the thirties; its twelve gated courtyards, includ-
ing a few right across from Broadway, choked the connection 
between the campus and Dixwell. 

But by the nineteen-eighties, the city’s reputation had 
deteriorated to the point that Yale started to worry about 
admissions numbers. Administrators concluded that since 
the university could not close itself off from New Haven’s 
problems, they needed some kind of buffer zone between the 
campus and the city. So a new tactic arose: investing in prop-
erties adjacent to the university.

Broadway still had several thriving businesses in the nine-
teen-nineties, including the Yankee Doodle Coffee Shop and 
Cutler’s record shop. But, according to Newman, the relative 
lack of shoppers made the presence of panhandlers across the 
street from undergraduate housing more obvious. Students 
in the architecture school had been reimagining Broadway as 
part of their coursework for years. Yale took those ideas, and 
hired Newman to run with them. “It was Yale turning its face, 
rather than its back, to the city,” Newman said. “We were the 
instrument.”

His firm seemed the perfect team for the task, having been 
located just off Broadway for thirty years. When Newman 
was hired, you could still conceivably claim his offices were 
on the dividing line between college and city. The fact that 
Nemerson, the city’s economic development chief, could 
characterize the neighborhood today as “the epitome of 
Yale” speaks to how effectively Newman’s redesign rebranded 
the street. Widened brick sidewalks, narrowed roads, cast 
iron fences and lampposts, American elms that hid a central 
parking lot—with these modifications, Newman Architects 
facilitated the creation of “The Shops at Yale.” Sprucing up 
the street made it much easier for Yale to rent out Broad-
way properties it had bought up, which in turn brought more 
pedestrians to the area.

“It isn’t that there’s less panhandlers there now than 
there were in the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies,” 
Newman said. “Many of them are the same people that I’ve 
known for fifty years on those streets.” He says the number of 
panhandlers, “fundamentally safe” people “trying to make a 
living,” has stayed the same, but the increase in shoppers has 
improved the street’s reputation. 

That may have truth to it. But the street isn’t a sort-of urban 
utopia, the kind of thing Jane Jacobs might hold up as a model 
of dense, integrated urban living. Shoppers from the suburbs, 
having parked in the elm-lined parking lot, don’t often stop 
to speak with the locals waiting under the newly painted bus 
shelter. And any panhandler would be hard-pressed to collect 
enough money to buy anything at most of the stores on the 
street, as Barbour, Lou Lou, and a dozen other “unique bou-
tique[s]” have replaced the diners and record shops. 

“That is a danger, no question about it,” Newman said 
about Broadway’s gentrification. “The university is in a 
unique position to be able to balance the aspirations of its 
real estate holdings with those of its students, and all of the 
citizens and people who live in New Haven.” It has failed so 
far, in the eyes of those who consider the street an extension 
of the “Yale bubble.”

Munday, the partner at Newman’s firm, pointed out that 
Broadway has always been a shopping street, and that “com-
merce is at the heart of cities.” And there’s an argument to 
be made for high-end shopping districts, whose properties 
can be taxed substantially to fund public services for strug-
gling areas. But a gentrified city street doesn’t quite live up 
to Newman’s inclusive vision. His brick sidewalks effectively 
claimed the street for Yale, making it less of a portal and more 
of a boundary.

Newman’s role in Yale’s conquering of Broadway 
seems almost like the payment of a debt, whether 
the architect intended it to be or not. The University 
not only gave him his degree, but also offered him his first 
job in a city he reveres. It invested $12.5 million in the Ninth 
Square redevelopment, which Newman says “wouldn’t have 
happened without Yale.” If Newman has his way, something 
similar could happen with the Tenth Square. 

“That’s an opportunity here,” Newman says, hitting the 
table in his office for emphasis. “Some people at Yale would 
argue that, ‘Well, the Coliseum site is a little far away’…I 
don’t believe that. New Haven is a small town. Each of these 
tendrils, they reach out and they call to each other.” 

The Tenth Square project has been mired in delays since 
2011, when Newman officially signed on to create a mas-
ter plan. The original plans for the site stretched across six 
city blocks, including a new community college on Church 
Street, residential, retail, and office space on the Knights of 
Columbus and Coliseum parking lots, and infill buildings 
on the other side of George Street. Newman’s designs called 
for a grand, tree-lined avenue parallel to George St., the kind 
of public street that “make[s] you proud of being a citizen of 
a city like New Haven, because you’re there with everybody 
else,” he said. 

Importantly for the Hill, the plans also included an 
extension of Orange Street over the Connector and into the 
detached neighborhood. It would become a path that con-
nected residents of Church Street South to the new civic 
hub, and downtown as a whole.  

Yet, in 2018, nothing has been built. The developer, Live-
WorkLearnPlay, has had trouble financing the project. Delay 
after delay has forced the firm to rein in its plans. Gateway 
Community College went up on Church Street in 2012, but it 
wasn’t designed by Newman. The Knights of Columbus have 
backed out of building anything on their lot. Most of the resi-
dents of Church Street South were relocated after the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development judged it 
uninhabitable. The Tenth Square now only includes the lot 
on which the Coliseum once stood. 

That lot is still big enough to host almost one-thousand 
apartments, along with thousands of square feet of retail 
space. But Newman has gone from his late seventies to his 
early eighties since signing onto the project. The Tenth 
Square could be the last floor he adds to the building that is 
his city, a final statement of what New Haven should look and 
feel like, of how its residents could interact with one another. 

And it’s hard to know what that statement will ultimately 
be. Newman is known—even loved—for helping rebuild 
New Haven after the ravages of urban renewal. Yet for all his 
adoration of Jane Jacobs’s sidewalks and storefronts, there’s 
evidence of a modernist streak left over from the days of Kahn 
and Moses and Lee, one that compels him toward the cre-
ation of modern-day “cathedrals” even as he acknowledges 
the failures of the old. 

For all his emphasis on inclusivity, his two largest proj-
ects have contributed to gentrification. This citizen-architect, 
earnestly trying to build the city for all, has been caught up 
in Yale’s incursions into nearby neighborhoods. Spaces like 
Broadway and the Ninth Square are well-designed, civic, and 
enjoyable, but often only if you make enough money. If the 
Tenth Square gets built, only to be filled with more “unique 
boutiques” and Barcades, then the philosophy of path, place, 
and portal will fall short of filling the holes created by urban 
renewal.
