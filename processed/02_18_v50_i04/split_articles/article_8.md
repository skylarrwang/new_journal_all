Yale researchers compete for the future of quantum computing

here are twelve half-a-million dollar refrigerators on 
the fourth floor of Yale’s Becton Center for Engineer-
ing and Applied Science. Cooled by liquid helium, 
they maintain a temperature of less than a hundredth of 
a degree Celsius above absolute zero. The refrigerators, 
which resemble industrial pipes, hiss in unison like a den of 
snakes. Inside each is a tangle of cords, wires, tubes, and cop-
per plates inscribed with handwritten alphanumeric symbols: 
a primitive quantum computer. 

Scientists and investors envision quantum computing as 
a technology exponentially more powerful than today’s clas-
sical computing. The speed and power of quantum com-
putation has the potential to revolutionize the world of fast 
finance, create an unbreakable system of encryption, and 
model otherwise unpredictable atomic behaviors crucial to 
the development of chemicals and drugs. Recently, several 
major Silicon Valley firms have joined a growing number of 
academic groups in the race to create a working, marketable 
quantum computer. Quantum Circuits, Inc., a New Hav-
en-based startup partnered with the Yale Quantum Institute, 
is considered a top contender to reach that goal, out of a field 
that includes IBM, Microsoft, and Google.

In January, I went to visit Luigi Frunzio, a senior member 
of Yale’s quantum computing department, who had offered to 
show me around. Frunzio has a bushy grey beard and a broad 
smile. He joined Yale’s team in 2003, during the lab’s infancy 
under the direction of professors Michel Devoret and Robert 
Schoelkopf. “It started at the beginning with each of them 
having one post-doc and a couple of PhD students,” Frunzio 
told me in his office. “Now each of them has five post-docs 
and twelve or thirteen graduate students.”

What makes quantum computers so much more powerful 
than classical computers is, most basically, a difference in 
their fundamental hardware. Classical computers store infor-
mation on ‘bits’ that have a choice between two states: one or 
zero, on or off. In a quantum computer, on the other hand, 
two elementary units­—called ‘qubits’—are able to “commu-
nicate” with each other through the quantum phenomena of 
superposition and entanglement. Each qubit can be in two 
states at once, and together they can be in four. Adding more 
qubits increases the computer’s processing potential expo-
nentially.

One of the tasks originally imagined for a quantum com-
puter would be to break enormous numbers into prime fac-
tors in a matter of seconds. These problems can take today’s 
computers days or months to solve, and form the basis of 
modern file encryption and secure communications—Yale’s 
quantum computing lab is, in fact, almost entirely funded by 
federal defense agencies, including IARPA, the Intelligence 
Advanced Research Projects Activity. While it threatens to 
render current encryption methods obsolete, however, quan-
tum technology also comes with its own, far more secure, 
form of encryption. Based on Heisenberg’s uncertainty prin-
ciple—an axiom of quantum mechanics that states that it is 
impossible to measure a particle’s position without changing 
its momentum—quantum cryptography would protect com-
munications from being intercepted. Since eavesdroppers 
cannot measure the characteristics of a quantum system with-
out altering its state, they would be unable to avoid detection. 

Frunzio explained that there remain many serious chal-
lenges to building a functional quantum computer, and even 
more to producing it on a commercial scale. For example, 
the qubits’ communications are only stable at incredibly low 
temperatures; hence the $500,000 refrigerators. “That already 
makes it a tool that my mom will never want to buy,” he said. 
He hopes, though, that the quantum world will eventually be 
downloaded to the “cloud” and available to everyone. IBM 
already put a simple five-qubit computer “online” a little 
over a year ago, and is planning to offer a sixteen-qubit ver-
sion soon (though for a fee). Frunzio points out that, with so 
few qubits, the current online quantum computers are only 
really useful for abstruse calculations foreign to most peo-
ple’s everyday life. But he imagines a not-so-distant future, 
in which users could be connected, for example, to “a video 
game on a quantum computer going so fast that it becomes 
like real life.”


In 2015, Frunzio, Schoelkopf, and Devoret spun off Quan-
tum Circuits, backed by venture capital firms, with the 
goal of commercializing their research. The startup occu-
pies an office on the second floor of 25 Science Park, a five-
story concrete and glass cube at the edge of Dixwell, beyond 
Pauli Murray College. Yale owns the building and rents 
spaces to private companies; down the hall from QCI are 
Kleo Pharmaceuticals’ headquarters and a PepsiCo chemical 
lab. For now, QCI is entirely housed in one long room, the 
windowed side partitioned into office cubicles. 

QCI is closely linked to the Yale quantum computing lab.

All four of its employees are either graduates of Yale’s quan-
tum physics doctorate program or worked there as postdocs, 
and, through a legal agreement with the university, the startup 
has exclusive rights to the Yale lab’s patents. However, all the 
researchers I met, both at Yale and at QCI, emphasized that 
the two projects have significantly different goals. Yvonne 
Gao, a graduate student studying with Professor Schoelkopf, 
explained that while the Yale academic efforts are focused on 
“the proof of principle experiments, demonstrating that cer-
tain principles of quantum mechanics could be realized in a 
laboratory experiment, QCI will have a very different empha-
sis, because for them it’s really about commercialization, the 
reproducibility of a certain type of device.”

QCI has already been successfully marketing one gad-
get for over a year: a quantum amplifier. “The amplifier is 
the read-out of the computer; it’s the way that you can read 
the qubits,” is how Frunzio described its function. Katrina 
Sliwa, who completed her Ph.D. under the direction of Pro-
fessor Devoret in May 2016 and was hired that same month 
as QCI’s first employee, is an expert in quantum amplifiers. 
She explained that “to go from a proof-of-concept device to a 
product, you have to worry about how reproducible you can 
make these things, how reliable you can make these things, 
and then there are small changes to the design that can be 
made to make them more user-friendly.” 

Professor Devoret helped to found QCI, but he recently 
left the company, feeling that tailoring quantum computing 
research to the market limits the scope of possible findings. 
Devoret, who is French, wears thick-framed glasses and 
speaks slowly and softly. “It’s not by perfecting candles that 
you discover electricity,” he told me in his office. “The indus-
tries only want to fund incremental research. They don’t 
want to fund wide research that looks far ahead in the future, 
they just want to make better products.” He prefers the way 
government grants are issued to Yale’s lab, less earmarked for 
specific projects and more designated for general exploration 
of the subject. “The great scientific discoveries have always 
been funded by governments. [The Yale lab’s money] is com-
ing from the American taxpayer. And I think it’s healthy, I 
think that’s what the government is for, doing this long-term 
investment in knowledge.”

I asked Frunzio whether the first quantum computer to 
surpass classical capabilities will come out of Yale. “I don’t 
think it’s going to come out of the Yale academic effort. 
Because, you see, why would I ask one of my students to 
repeat the same experiment fifty or sixty times?” he said, add-
ing, “But I hope that QCI will be in that race. Will it be the 
first? We’ll see.”

Frunzio is optimistic about QCI’s chances because he feels 
the competitive advantage in such a cutting-edge field lies 
primarily with small, focused startups, rather than enormous 
tech giants. Large companies are interested in staying com-
petitive in relevant consumer markets and will only heavily 
invest in new domains once they become profitable. “It’s the 
difference between a mammal and a dinosaur,” Frunzio said. 
“You know, the dinosaur is big, but just to think to move his 
tail takes a long time because it’s so big.” 

The mammal is certainly thinking hard. Its tail hasn’t 
moved much yet, but if you look closely, you’ll see it begin-
ning to twitch.
