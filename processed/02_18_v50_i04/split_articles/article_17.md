New Haven is a pockmarked city, riddled with remind-
ers of an era when City Hall thought the only way 
to save it from economic peril was to tear out row 
houses and typewriter shops and replace them with beasts 
of concrete and steel. One of those beasts, the Knights of 
Columbus tower, looms over one such wound: an asphalt 
wasteland of parking lots, four-lane streets, and fenced-in 
parks left behind by twenty years of urban renewal. 

Richard Munday says it’s not all bad. He likes how the 
tower scoffs at the surrounding streets, its colossal brown pil-
lars refusing to perfectly nestle into the corner of Church 
Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. But he’s an 
urban architect, and urban architects typically prefer cities 
with fabric, their streets and sidewalks and structures all inter-
weaving into a cohesive whole. This area, between Union 
Station and Gateway Community College, definitely doesn’t 
fit that definition. It’s more like downtown’s frayed southern 
end. 

The Oak Street Connector freeway extends westward from 
the I-95, runs behind the Knights of Columbus tower, and 
feeds into the base of the former Alexion headquarters a few 
blocks away. Looking from the tower toward the Connector, 
it’s hard to remember that this blacktop sea used to be the 
Oak Street neighborhood, which, according to architectural 
historian Vincent Scully, was “one of the few [racially] inte-
grated enclaves in New Haven.” Unfortunately for the resi-
dents who ran its thriving flea markets and lived in its decay-
ing duplexes, Mayor Richard C. Lee (who served as mayor 
from 1954 to 1970) considered it a den of “whore houses and 
gin mills.”

During his tenure at City Hall, Lee buried Oak Street 
under paeans to the automobile age, like the Connector, the 
Knights of Columbus tower, and the New Haven Coliseum. 
A hockey stadium hidden under a four-story parking garage, 
the Coliseum was demolished in 2007, cheered on by hun-
dreds of New Haveners who thought sparkling new develop-
ments would follow. More than a decade later, however, the 
gash in the city’s fabric remains, stranding residents in the 
adjacent Hill neighborhood—including the descendants of 
Oak Street’s refugees—behind the Connector. 

If Munday and his partners get their way, that will soon 
change. Munday works for Newman Architects, a local firm 
that has already designed hundreds of mixed-income apart-
ments and fifty thousand square feet of retail a block over 
from the empty Coliseum site. Now, they’ve turned their 
eyes toward the parking lots and barren streets that mark the 
remains of Oak Street, with the goal of reincorporating this 
area into downtown. “The development of this area is con-
nected with extending the fabric that you see on that side 
of George Street, into this area, and then down to the train 
station,” Munday said. “Suddenly, this becomes not an edge, 
but a center.” That centering includes extending Orange 
Street across the Connector and into the Hill, linking it back 
to the central city. 

Newman Architects’ founder, Herbert Newman, has been 
trying to “knit New Haven’s urban areas together again” for 
longer than almost anyone else. He has shaped the city’s pub-
lic and commercial spaces over the last fifty years; the Oak 
Street revival could cement his reputation for reintroducing 
commerce and civic life to New Haven. Yet his past attempts 
to balance the interests of Yale, City Hall, and major property 
developers suggest that this project could further divide the 
city rather than putting its pieces back together. 

“W
e proposed—” Newman starts, then stops. 
He jolts up to snatch some plans off a shelf 
across the room, walking less like the eighty-
three-year-old he is and more like the thirty-something he 
was when he first opened this office in the nineteen-six-
ties—no nonsense, impatient to return to his point. Waning 
November light seeps in through slivers of glass cut into the 
brick wall, landing on foot-tall foam row houses, new floor 
plans for a burnt-out church, and a poster that asks, “Can a 
Public Library Renew Our Civil Society?” Before I can read 
its answer, Newman is back in his chair, plans on the table. 
“What we proposed,” he says, pausing for effect this time, 
“was that we move the city further east.”

By “city,” Newman means New Haven’s commercial core, 
defined by the Nine Squares. The north-south diamond they 
form has shaped the growth of New Haven, America’s first 
planned city, ever since colonial surveyor John Brockett cut 
them into the landscape in 1638. From his brick box of an 
office on the walkway between Morse College and Mory’s, 
Newman is trying to add a Tenth where the Coliseum once 
stood. 

Which sounds, well, ambitious—maybe even impossible. 
But not if you’re someone who has already designed, reno-
vated, or planned half the city, including Union Station, 
City Hall, and a magnet school in Wooster Square. Yale Law 
School, Jonathan Edwards College, most of Old Campus—
the list goes on, and on. This is a man who “sees cities as 
sort-of a tableau, a canvas,” as New Haven economic devel-
opment administrator Matthew Nemerson put it. Newman 
mentions this city in the same breath as “Teotihuacan outside 
of Mexico City, or Jerusalem, or Athens, or Corinth,” and 
over the last half-century, he has made it his masterwork. 
The Tenth Square would be his latest brushstroke. The 
Knights of Columbus tower and a parking lot the size of a 
hockey rink now define this part of town, which lies a block 
southeast of Bow Tie Cinemas and the Omni Hotel. New-
man thinks this area, roughly bounded by Union Station, the 
Ninth Square neighborhood, and the Church Street South 
housing projects, could become a colony of shops, restau-
rants, and apartments, all surrounding a new public square. 
He’s thinking on a scale not typically associated with archi-
tects, one at which individual buildings are more like bricks 
placed in service of a larger whole. “The city becomes the 
building,” Newman said later. “The city is the architecture.”

That sense of scale reigned supreme when Newman first 
trained as an architect. He spent his early childhood in
