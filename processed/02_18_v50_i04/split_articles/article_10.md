Free Library about Kindred by Octavia Butler, a novel that 
oscillates between a plantation in antebellum Maryland 
and 1976 California. After that, she’s considering Ta-Nehisi 
Coates’s “The Case for Reparations.” Carby, who thinks 
the United States is segregated enough to be considered 
an apartheid state, hopes the project will push Guilford 
residents to realize that the difference between slavery and 
contemporary society is smaller than they think.


One evening, as the sun started to set over the green, a 
mom walked by one of the Guilford Witness stones with 
her child. In the fading light, the coaster-sized brass was 
hard to see, but the girl, perhaps one of Culliton’s eighth 
graders, pulled her mom to a stop and pointed at the stone 
insistently. “Moses: Enslaved Here: 1762-1812,” it read. The 
mom smiled at her daughter, looked down at the stone for 
a few moments, then picked her head back up, ready to 
keep walking. The girl stayed in place, still staring at the 
stone, not yet ready to leave.

Kristine Iglesias, a lifelong Guilford resident and found-

she and her family were among the town’s first Black res-
idents. “I’m glad my parents chose Guilford,” she said at 
the installation ceremony. “And while I’m not blind to the 
prejudices that still exist here, I am fiercely loyal to this 
town.” As Iglesias was growing up, fellow residents some-
times assumed that she was an underprivileged girl from 
New Haven, or that she was related to her principal, who 
was also Black. Like most people in Guilford, she only 
recently learned through Culliton that slaves had once 
lived there, and the discovery has deepened her connec-
tion to the town. “There’s no such thing as good slavery, 
but there are stories of people who had lives, communi-
ties, families to come home to,” Iglesias said. “There’s a 
sadness to it, but it’s also empowering, to me and my kids 
as well, knowing that Black people helped make this town 
what it is.” 


Hazel Carby, a Witness Stones board member and 
professor of African American Studies at Yale, wants to 
expand the project’s scope within Guilford. On February 
21, she will lead a book club discussion at the Guilford
