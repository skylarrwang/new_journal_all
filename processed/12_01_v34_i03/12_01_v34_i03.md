EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To ARGUE WITH KATHLEEN CLEAvER is to 
realize your ignorance. She knows more than 
you. She will interrupt you, contradict you, 
and leave you tongue-tied. She will overwhelm you with her fiery eloquence. 

At 58, she has abandoned the Afro, 
leather boots, and miniskirts that she favored 
in her days as a Black Panther in the late 
196os, but she is still strikingly beautiful. Her 
hair falls in skinny braids; chunky silver 
bracelets clink up and down her wrists. Her 
confidence is palpable. She carries around 
books by her friends Noam Chomsky and 
Evelyn Williams, quoting them freely and 
often. She speaks clearly, in deep, warm tones, 
with precise t's and flickering l's. 

Cleaver has had time to perfect her 
speaking skills, having devoted her entire life 
to activism. She is best known as a leader of 
the Black Panther Party, a militant black 
power group that had its heyday in the 196os 
and 1970s. In an interview with The New 
journal in 1981, Cleaver described the 
Panthers' attitude at the height of the movement: "When people reach the point that 
they won't respect you, they won't give you 
what you want, and they won't be reasonable, 
then just shoot them. Then, you can talk to 
them. If you make it clear that you're not 
going to be pushed around any more, that 
anyone who tries will be shot, it changes the 
dialogue a lot." Initially, Cleaver was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee, a civil rights group, but she grew 
frustrated with the slow pace of the nonviolence movement and joined the Panthers. 
There she met her future husband Eldridge 
Cleaver, the Panthers' Minister of 
Information. After Eldridge was charged with 
assault and attempted murder by the 
Oakland, CA, police, she fled with him to 
Algeria in 1969. 

She returned to the United States in 1975 
with two children in tow, and continued to 
work as a civil rights activist during the '7os. 
In 1981, she enrolled at Yale, earning her bachelor's degree in 1984 and her JD from the Law 
School in 1989. She currently teaches at 
Emory Law School. 

Cleaver's extraordinary credentials and 
reputation for radical opinions brought her 
back to Yale for the 2001 Black Solidarity 
Conference. I listened to her keynote speech 
that Saturday, and I was blown away. Hardly 
stopping to take a sip of water, she called on 
students to reject the propaganda that white 
American institutions spout, to stay connected to each other and to black communities, 
and to remember the millions of historical 
atrocities committed against black people in 
the United States. She spoke forcefully and 
confidently, with a calm insistence that the 
audience take her seriously. Her words were 
not exactly hostile, but two or three times, I 
averted my eyes as one of the few white people in the room. 

An hour later, I was sitting in a sun-
drenched room in Linsly-Chinenden Hall, 
fumbling with my tape recorder and not sure 
what to expect from Cleaver. But Cleaver has 
an uncanny ability to adapt her message to 
her audience. As soon as she came into the 
room, her manner was friendly, and she 
immediately had me talking about my reactions to her speech. 

Not quite demanding, not quite emo-
tional, not quite urgent, her voice has been 
seasoned with 30 years of experience. At a 
time when most peoples' parents were settling 
into jobs and shrouding themselves in the 
idyllic comfort of the suburbs, she was going 
back to school to further arm herself with 
knowledge. She watched this country 
descend into what she sees as solidly 
entrenched conservatism; she watched as the 
Black Panther Party, its members blacklisted, 
disintegrated, leaving political prisoners from 
the '6os still behind bars. She has seen draft 
dodgers grow old and conservative, and she 
has seen a major shift in the mindset of their 
children. "During the '6os young people were 
more under the influence of the values of 
their parents, their Sunday school, their 
Hebrew school," she told me. "They were 
shocked, absolutely shocked, by the assassination of the president, they were appalled by 
the violence and genocidal destructiveness of 
the Vietnam War. There was a sense that the 
violence against civil rights workers was horrendous. I think the recognition that you 
know what's right, that the government's 
doing what's wrong--that's all gone. Your 
generation is much more cynical and says, 
'Oh, he's a crook. Oh, he's a hypocrite. So 
what else is new?' And there's this acceptance 
of this degenerate behavior on the part of the 
government." 

But despite her frustration that America 
is wallowing in political stagnation, she does 
not seem tired. At one point in our conversation she hinted slightly at burnout, but clearly, she has not given up or joined the 
Establishment. "What I do is try to gain the 
attention of people who will be operating 
within the system to make them understand 
certain legal processes that have this extraordinary degree of tyranny, to understand how 
the system can be abused. If you 
recognize that, you can act to challenge it--not to go in all starry-
eyed and think the law is for the 
people, 'cause it's not. The legal system 
operates on behalf of the established 
order to protect the material 
wealth of those who are in charge 
of the established order. If you are 
willing to go up against that, you 
spend an enormous amount of 
time and resources and effort 
defending the people who challenge the laws, and you need a 
whole lot more troops to do this." 

She addressed the issue of 
well-intentioned white liberals who 
aren't sure what to do to improve 
race relations on a campus like 
Yale's. "It's not black people who 
are racist--black people are the targets of racism. So there's been a 
whole movement built up to 
defend and to resist racism. People who disagree with racism who are white tend to look 
to the recipients of the racism as a source of 
how to deal with it instead of looking to the 
source of the racism, which is in the leadership of white communities. Do the black people have to do all the work?" 

She called on college students to break 
out of their current complacency. "To me, 
that's what a person in a highly intellectual 
environment is supposed to do: ask questions, 
not just accept what you're told at face value. 
That's what you're told in your classrooms, 
right? So are you supposed to ask questions 
only of the material in the classroom? You 
can't ask questions of the material in the New 
York Times. I mean, come on." 


She had spoken about the evils of globalization, the capitalistic domination of the 
American government, and the lack of access 
to non-corporate media, but I still had questions about her history. She flatly denied the 
most common criticism of the Panthers, that 
"'The Black Panther Party advocated division.' No. The Black Panther Party is recognizing the causes of this division and advocating a means to work across it. That's a radical 
departure. The media and the government 
benefit from the division. So they see these 
Black Panthers and the anti-war protesters 
working together, and they say, 'Let's figure 
out how we can stop it.'" 

I felt myself being sucked in by her 
rhetoric, but as I walked out of the interview, 
my initial burst of admiration gave way to my 
old cynical reflex. Looking back on our conversation, I knew that plenty of analytical, 
arrogant Yalies would probably scoff at 
Cleaver's calls to action. Maybe my caution-
ary voice is right, and her ideas are irrational 
and far-fetched. But I'm inclined to think her 
viewpoint is all the more important now. 
Cleaver has devoted 30-odd years to fighting 
for what she believes in, and she has adapted 
her strategy to a completely different era. 
Though the rest of the world might have 
given up, Cleaver's revolution continues.

THIS IS YOUR BRAIN. This is your brain on 
computers. In roughly 30 years, give or take, 
our brains will be uploaded onto computers, 
professor Nick Bostrom imagines. "You'll 
wake up and find yourself living in a virtual 
reality." 

From his cloistered office above the computer lab in Connecticut Hall, 28-year-old 
Bostrom is helping to speed up human evolution. Bostrom, a lecturer in the Yale philosophy department, is the co-founder of the 
World Transhumanist Association (WTA). 
Transhumanism, a term coined by Aldous 
Huxley, describes the further evolution of 
humanity through educational and psychological means. However, around 15 years ago, 
a disparate group of people who were interested in the use of all kinds of technologies to 
"evolve" human life--from cryonics and 
space travel to drugs--co-opted the term. 

Since childhood, Bostrom has believed that 
sooner or later we would learn how to 
enhance human intelligence and develop 
machines that would be smarter than 
humans. Around five years ago, he learned 
there were others with the same ideas. 

Founded in 1998, the WTA attempts to 
bring together this varied group of people, to 
advance the acceptance of Transhumanism as 
an academic field, and to foster greater public 
awareness and networking about 
Transhumanist concepts. Bostrom is determined to lead this movement out of the ivory 
tower; he proudly claims that over 1600 people have joined, from truck drivers to film 
producers to academics and engineers. 

In addition to producing journals 
and 
websites 
promulgating 
Transhumanism, the WTA holds annual conferences to discuss developments. Last year's 
conference in London included lectures on 
topics such as "The Hedonistic Imperative" 
and "My Life as a Cyborg." 

According to Bostrom, the basic tenet is 
that "we can and should use technology to 
overcome some of the fundamental limitations of human nature." To Bostrom, the 
concept of a static human "nature" is passé. 
Transhumanists would enhance our intellectual abilities, abolish the aging process, and 
improve our emotional experiences through 
such technologies as artificial intelligence, 
molecular nanotechnology, and "uploading." 
Uploading would entail creating a 3-D molecular map of the brain and then transferring 
this brain architecture onto a computer--a 
"source code of your mind." "Information 
processing can be done on silicon as well as

biological neurons," Bostrom explains. "If 
computers can work one thousand times 
faster, so can your brain." 

Bostrom also encourages the develop-
ment of "smart drugs" that would enhance 
cognitive performance--like steroids for the 
mind. He has no problem with self-medicat-
ing. Medicines should be like food, Bostrom 
says. "If a different substance is required to 
make a better life, the fact that it is unnatur-
al shouldn't be an argument against it." 

Since much of this technology is still in 
development, the way to live in accordance 
with the Transhumanist ethos, according to 
Bostrom, is to exercise, eat healthfully, not 
smoke, avoid high-risk activities, use email, 
drink copious amounts of caffeine, and chew 
nicotine gum (it "increases concentration"). 

As Bostrom explains this, the robotic voice 
from Radiohead's "Fitter Happier" replays in 
my mind: "Fitter, Happier, More productive, 
Comfortable, Not drinking too much, 
Regular exercise at the gym .... " And, of 
course, as good Transhumanists, we should 
make sure that we are frozen in liquid nitro-
gen, instead of being cremated or buried, 
when we finally die. 

Not surprisingly, the prospect of increas-
ing cognitive abilities through a variety of 
means has played well at Yale. "The feedback 
bas been extremely enthusiastic!" Bostrom 
exclaims. A Transhumanist working group 
comprised primarily of Yale researchers and 
faculty has been established, and Bostrom 
hopes to offer a class on Transhumanism next 
fall. "The reason I wanted to do the class was 
because of a lack of opportunity among 
undergraduates to think about the future of 
the species," Bostrom says. For Bostrom, an 
understanding of Transhumanism is crucial 
for students since, "Transhumanism will 
affect everything from institutions and eco-
nomic systems to study techniques," and, 
after all, "the undergraduate may live to see 
these things happen."

**Jai and Dry**
**Author: Blake Wilson**
**Page number(s): 7-8**

ONLY 1WO TYPES OF FANS come tO a jai-alai 
match anymore: compulsive gamblers and 
the chronically bored. Sometimes they are 
both: young, sweaty men who scratch lottery 
tickets in between matches; ancient, transpar-
ent-skinned couples who clutch three-dollar 
bets and pass whole minutes staring above the 
action with unresponsive eyes. These miser-
able specimens-
and few of them-are what 
I found at the self-proclaimed International 
Championships of]ai-Alai on the weekend of 
November 2-4, in Milford, CT. But it hardly 
matters. The Milford Jai-Alai Fronron is the 
last professional venue for this sport in 
Connecticut, and it is closing in December. 

The immediate cause for the Fronron's 
demise is that the tribal casinos Foxwoods 
and Mohegan Sun have taken away its busi-
ness. It might have been able to keep afloat, 
but Sports Haven, the off-track betting estab-
lishment by the New Haven Harbor, has 
refused to share its franchise. So at the 
Fronton long seams of grass crack through 
the empty parking lots, only three of the 50 
betting windows remain open, and you can 
get a beer or a cheeseburger for 99 cents on 
Thursdays. The glory days of Milford Jai-
Alai, back before they closed the lounge, 
when high-rollers tipped valets and thousands 
packed the place, are long past. As soon as the 
casinos opened, the crowds and the money 
left, not only because Milford Jai-Alai is a sin-
gularly unpleasant place; but also because the 
jai-alai played there is an awfully depressing 
game. 

Jai-alai resembles a racquet sport, 
although players catch and throw the ball 
with scoop-shaped baskets strapped to thei~ 
wrist. Once I realized this, and once I stopped 
listening to the butchered Basque affectations 
of the announcer, the game became easy to 
follow. Its dynamic and rules are more or less 
those of squash. What really makes jai-alai 
different is not that players propel the ball 
with sestas, or that they call their ball a pe/ota, 
but that the court is 140 feet long, and the 
ball can travel over 150 miles per hour. 

My program cheerily explained the ori-
gins of jai-alai as a version of handball played 
against the sides of Basque cathedrals. In its 
primal form, played by local rules, it demand-
ed almost superhuman agility, endurance, 
and strategy. In America, jai-alai was intro-
duced as a new diversion for fin de si~c/e 
crowds just becoming familiar with sluggish 
domestic sports and their beefy players: foot-
ball, baseball, boxing. The 1904 World's Fair 
in St. Louis packed a 6ooo-seat stadium with 
an audience that had never imagined lithe, 
olive-skinned young men or the gymnastic 
potential of professional athletes. Throughout 
the 1930s, jai-alai was a major draw for 
Florida's emerging tourist industry. But its 
true glory days were in pre-Castro Havana-
the capital city of exotic pleasure. 

Betting on jai-alai first became legal in 
those Florida frontons. Gambling did more 
than change the spectator's relationship with 
the sport, it changed the game itself. Like ten-
nis or squash, jai-alai does not naturally make 
a good betting game. This is because the 
matches are long, two sides compete, and you 
either win or lose your bet. Bookies make 
team sports more interesting by giving gam-
blers the chance to call point spreads or wager 
on the performance of one player, but jai-alai 
is played to a point limit, with only two play-
ers-four when playing doubles. American 
ingenuity found a way to ftx jai-alai with the 
"Spectacular Seven" scoring system, which 
pits eight players against each other in a 
round robin. Player one serves to player two. 
Whoever wins serves to player three. After all 
eight have played a point, the scoring dou-
bles. Games are played to seven. 

Anyone who has watched or played ten- . 
nis or squash knows that while a long rally is 
exciting, racquet sports are more about 
endurance and strategy than agility and 
power. A 15-second tennis spot on the eleven 
o'clock news is not interesting at all; a 45-
minute set can be riveting. The same is true 
with jai-alai, but "Spectacular Seven" ~cans 
that a match is made up of 30 or 40 fragments 
without the narrative of a continuous game to 
expose the players' strategy or to prove their 
athleticism. This mode of play makes it pos-
sible to bet in an astonishing number of ways, 
fits r6 games into an afternoon or evening, 
·and it used to make real money for fronton 
owners-Milford dragged in $87 million in 
1988. But it also means that professional jai-
alai is phenomenally un-fun to watch. 

Jai-alai players are no more enthusiastic 
than the crowd. One or two points is not long 
enough to get into one's groove, so almost 
every player leaves the court kicking she wall 
and scowling. The new shape of the sport has 
also taken the need for endurance out of the 
game, and made power more important-
serving aces is the way to win in "Spectacular 
Seven." This has reshaped the players in turn: 
Now they are sluggish and stocky, as unen-
thusiastic in their physiognomy as in their 
performance. A couple of them rallied for the 
big tournament, which pitched them against 
players from Spain and Florida for $2o,ooo in 
prizes-not chump change for someone who 
pulls in 40 or 50K a year, and who will be 
unemployed come December. But their .best 
moments wt;re only mediocre, and the place 
seemed only a little less drab when a Milford 
player named Wayne won me 16 bucks. 

Acrually, some of the doubles games 
-were pretty good. But if the international 
roster of players assembled for the tour-
nament was any indication of the 
strength of the field, then there is not a 
man alive today who plays the whole 
court well. The New Haven Register 
reports that some players are moving to 
Florida or Rhode Island to keep playing; 
some of them will probably return home 
to Basque Spain. But my visits to Milford 
have proven to my satisfaction that jai-
alai has been a dead sport for decades, 
and that it is now a dying industry as 
well. The whole appeal of the game rests 
in a relationship between the audience 
and the spectacle which has been made 
irrelevant and impossible by our media 
culture and our shortening attention 
spans, even without "Spectacular Seven" 
thrown in the mix. Foxwoods may be a 
grim place itself, but at least there you can 
breathe the oxygen of real money, and of 
real human drama. An old widower hitting 
the jackpot on quarter slots or a young fami-
ly man cashing personal checks for more 
chips-this is entertainment with some blood 
in it.

**By Any Other Name**
**Author:  (Not specified)**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

OBITUARIES AND FOOTBALL SCORES graced its 
pages in the 18oos, and during the 1960s pho-
tographs of nude women appeared on its 
cover. And at the height of the Yak Literary 
Magazinls most unexpected incarnation in 
the late 1970s, Russian themes and ideas per-
meated the publication. During this era, the 
magazine, established in 1836 and bearing dis-
tinction as both the oldest existing publica-
tion at Yale and the oldest literary review in 
North America, almost lost its very name. 

Most students part with their extracur-
ricular activities when they graduate, but this 
was not the case for one former editor of the 
Lit, Andrei Navrowv. After graduating in 
1978, he began to publish a magazine to 
which be gave the inventive tide the Yak 
Literary Magazine. The new magazine, staffed 
by Navrozov and his compatriots, had a dis-
tinctly Russian focus, including Navrozov's 
own translations of poems by two Russian 
Nobel laureates, Joseph Brodsky and Boris 
Pasternak. Though Navrozov and the maga-
zine remained in New Haven, Navrozov no 
longer had any official affiliation with the 
University, and the publication was produced 
entirely outside of Yale. The Yak Litmzry 
Magazine was no longer a Yale organization. 

Navrozov's "Yale Lit" managed to incur a 
$7o,ooo debt by 1980. He desperately 
searched for support and lit upon the 
American Literary Sociery in 1981. With the 
underwriting of the conservative organiza-
tion, the circulation of the magazine rose to 
uooo and it gained an international reader-
ship. In 1982, the editorial board of 
THE NEW JoURNAL 

Navrozov's magazine claimed "the Yak 
Literary Magazine is in its Golden Age." 

Indeed, the magazine enticed contributors 
such as Ezra Pound and William F. Buckley, · 
Jr., though it was Buckley himself who noted 
in an article published in Navrowv's maga-
zine that "the Yak Literary Magazine has wan-
dered as far away from the direct concerns of 
Yale University as Yale University has wan-
dered 
from 
the 
concerns 
of 
Congregationalist Church." 

Buckley was not the only one to notice 
the separation of the Yak Literary Magazine 
from Yale University. Yale rewrote its 
Undergraduate Regulations in 1982 to explic-
itly state for the first time that all University 
organizations using Yale's name had to be reg-
istered and controlled by currently enrolled 
undergraduate students. 

· 
Navrowv then took his most drastic 
step. He and the American Literary Society 
sued Yale for creating the new policy, claim-
ing that the University had acted illegally and 
fraudulently by revising the regulations. The 
American Literary Society complained that 
the "rule-change had been brought about by 
a handful of jealous professors," according to 
the New Havm journal Courier. 

Defeated by the Connecticut Superior 
Court, Navrozov and the American Literary 
Society appealed, alleging that the revised 
rule violated anti-trust laws. "We're bloody, 
but unbowed at this point," said their lawyer. 

Vehemently claiming that he had bought 
the rights to the name of the Yak Literary 
Magazine for $1.00 from the undergraduate 
organization that 
once controlled 
it, 
Navtozov argued that he deserved complete 
control over the name. And meanwhile, the 
American Literary Society filed an applica-
tion with the us Patent and Trademark Office 
to register the trademark "Yale Literary 
Magazine." The application was denied. 

"Their claim of sham litigation is wholly 
unsubstantiated by anything in the record," 
stated the fed-up federal judge in 1987, afrer

the case had dragged on for four years. In 
unusually strong terms, he chastised the tech-
niques that Navrozov and the Society used in 
court: "[Their] complaint is rife with refer-
ences to the University's history, its economic 
structure, the 'secret societies at Yale,' and a 
multitude of other allegations patently irrele-
vant to this action." He could not contain his 
amazement at Navrozov's persistence: "It is at 
best curious and at worst bizarre that plain-
tiffs fail to acknowledge the fact that the 
University prevailed in each of these proceed-
ings." 

Again "unbowed" by the outcome of the 
trial, Andrei Navrozov continued in a literary 
career as a translator and journalist. In a 
recent review he wrote on Thomas Harris's 
Cannibal, he stated that he and his Russian 
friends, after years of discussions, have come 
to agree that "every man alive has more ene-
mies than he has friends." 

The Russians did not succeed in taking 
over the the Lie-but another unexpected 
group would attempt to do just that. The 
magazine lay dormant during most of the 
trial, but in 1989, students who were officers 
Party of the Right registered its own board 
under the name of the Yale Literary Magazine. 

Both groups demanded to be recognized 
as the editors of the new Lit. 

During deliberations by Dean of Student 
Affairs Betty Trachtenberg, the Party of the 
Right pulled out a surprising document;. a let-
ter from Andrei Navrozov, which declared 
that he had sold the name of the Yak Literary 
Magazine to the Party of the Right for 
$x.oo-the very name which the federal court 
had definitively established as belonging to 
the University, not Navrozov. After a bureau-
cratic scramble, the Parry of the Right lost its 
claim to the name and the literary board was 
allowed to re-register as an undergraduate 
organization in September 1989. Yet to this 
day; the Parry of the Right has a quote from 
·Andrei Navrozov prominently posted on 
their web page: "The Party of the Right i.s a 
group of people who prefer a bad paradox to 
a good cliche." 

The new board of the Lit requested 
$130.67 
from 
the 
Undergraduate 
Organizations Funding Committee to sup-
port the rebuilding and restructuring of the 
current editors-in-chief Emily Weiss and 
Zach Weinman, the magazine fell into debt 
after last spring's issue. Four college 'masters 
donated $500 each to pay the debt. If the 
magazine goes over budget again, the cost will 
be bursar billed to the accounts of the editors-
in-chief, who will nor be permitted to register 
for classes or graduate until the bill is paid. 

Thus seems to be the fate of the Lit-
like 
Madame Ravensky in Chekhov's The Cherry 
Orchard, a noble name fallen upon hard times 
and beleaguered by crackpots.

ONE AFTERNOON, DANNY SIEGEL (AKA "The 
Feeling Person's Thinker," AKA "The Pied 
Piper ofTzedakah," AKA "The Most Famous 
Unknown Jewish Poet in America") led Yale 
in its first ever "Mitzvah Walk." It was unusu-
ally warm for October, and Danny met our 
small group of six Yale students outside of the 
Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale 
wearing a baseball cap, tinted bifocals, a worn 
shirt, khaki shorts, and sneakers. Tucked 
under his right arm were several pam-
phlets and a glossy paperback copy of 
his latest book I + I = 3 and 37 Other 
Mitzvah Principks to Live By. (Mitzvah 
is the Hebrew word for commandment 
used by Siegel and many others to mean 
"good deed.") "What we're trying to find 
out," he explained, "is how local businesses 
could be useful co the people of the commu-
nity. For instance, if a restaurant throws out 
all its leftover food at the end of the day, we 
need co find a way to get that food to people 
who need it. Basically, we're looking for peo-
ple with certain 'expercises,' but not the kind 
of 'expertises' you'd think would be immedi-
ately useful. oK?" A round of head nods, a few 
uncertain smiles, and then Danny was off. 
walking slowly but talking a mile a minute 

Both groups demanded to be 
recog n .• zed 


and in no coherent fashion-first it was mitv 
vahs, then New Haven, then his non-profit 
Ziv Tzedakah Fund, which somehow led to 
therapeutic horseback riding in Israel, which· 
segued into the various charitable uses for 
hotel shampoo, followed by a long digression 
on the Lion's Club, used eyeglasses, and refer-
ences to his poetry, and eventually returned to 
our New Haven "Mitzvah Walk." And all this 
before we got to the fiiSt stop. 

In his off-the-wall way, Danny Siegel has 
spent nearly 30 years trying tO get people to 
subscribe to a simple philosophy: "Whatever 
I want for myself, I want for other people." 
Since 1981 he has distributed over $4.5 million 
through the Ziv Tzedakah Fund, an organiza-
tion that, according to its literature, claims to 
"receive contributions which [it] gives to 
inspiring individuals and programs," so that 
good people can carry on good deeds, or 
mitzvahs, through the generosiry of others. 

Most of Danny's 25-plus books promote 
tzedakah, the Hebrew word for "righteous-
ness," which they translate as "doing the right 
thing," and the work of "Mitzvah heroes"-
people who, as he puts it, go out of their way 
"to fix the world." But he insists, "I don't 
fundraise. I'm not a fundraiser. I speak, and 
people send money. That's all." In fact Danny 
earns his living entirely though the sale of his 
books, which include several volumes of poet-
ry (more than a few out of print), and 
through speaking engagements at syna-
gogues, colleges, and various conferences. For 
$1500 Slifka got a Mitzvah Walk, a working 
dinner, and a formal talk, all of which were 
intended, as Danny put it, "to raise awareness 
about doing good and becoming good peo-
ple." 

Bur watching Danny Siegel take on the 
New Haven business communiry, one might 
wonder how he became such a sought-after 
lecturer. At our first stop, a local dry cleaners, 
the manager had been forewarned about 
Danny's visit, but still seemed flustered by his 
rapid-fire questions: "What do you do with 
clothes left for more than three months? 
What do you do with clothes you think no 
one will claim?" He drew closer to the already 
befuddled manager. "Is there a place where 
you could donate them?" he pressed. "Do you 
ever do alterations for free? Do you ever do 
cleanings for free for people who can't afford 
them?" As Danny explained later, this kind of 
approach is fairly typical. "It's a kind of free 
association," he said. "I am incapable of 
thinking linearly. So I can't give you a system-
atic explanation, only a free-associative one." 

Apparently the manager was a linear thinker. 
After a thoughtful pause, he replied that the 
cleaners usually returned clothes to their 
owners and that although people would 
sometimes leave their garments for extended 
·periods of time, they almost invariably 
claimed rhein. I could tell this was not exact-
ly the answer .Danny was hoping for, but he 
still seemed optimistic and urged us on to our 
next business, a nearby coffee shop. 

But upon reaching the cafe, D anny 
seemed suddenly fatigued and ducked out for 
a few minutes to "clear his head," giving at 
least one of my fellow walkers a chance to 
speak freely. Micah Lapidus, the current 
Jewish Campus Service Corps (Jcsc) Fellow 
at Slifka, tried to explain his reasons for 
bringing Danny to Yale. Micah first heard 
Danny speak less than a year ago, while still a 
senior at Stanford, and asked him that very 
day to come speak at Yale the following year. 
"My motivation," he explained, as we waited 
for coffee on Slifka's tab, "was to let other 
people hear what he has to say. H e sees things 
in ways the rest of us would never think 
about." Micah paused for a moment, the 
expression on his face one of undisguised 
admiration and enthusiasm. "I don't know," 
he concluded. "His message is simple, but 
that doesn't diminish it in any way. H e's real-
ly a true paradigm." 

Unfortunately, Danny's zeal for good 
works did not prove universally infectious. 
Despite a friendly reception at the coffee 
shop, we received no guarantees about possi-
ble donations to local shelters, and after less 
than five minutes at a New Haven copy store, 
Danny seemed to deduce that discount copies 
for charity would not be forthcoming, at least 
not from the unsmiling gentlemen behind 
the counter. The cosmetics store around the 
corner proved no more hopeful. When 
D anny asked a young saleswoman about free 
manicures for battered women, she only 
looked up from her inventory long enough to 
inform us, "Nail polish isn't environmentally 
safe." Then again, it was probably obvious 
that Danny wasn't going "to hang around for a 
makeover. 

After only four businesses in just under 
two hours, we left the cosmetics store with 
about half our original walkers (the others 
lost to "class" or "section"), and Danny told 
us he needed a nap. Still, he remained confi-
dent about the "Mitzvah Walk." He turned to 
the remaining walkers and urged us to go 
back and follow up on his work. A couple 
nodded noncommittally, but at least one 
looked as though he had found his hero. 
"People ask me why the stuff we do is impor-
tant when terrorists are flying planes into the 
World Trade Center," Danny told us. "But it 
is important. It's about human dignity. Every 
time I pass these pamphlets on to a new per-
son, every time someone cuts their hair for a 
cancer victim, every time som eone drives left-
over food to a shelter, it makes a difference." 

A few minutes later a heavyset woman carry-
ing a shopping bag filled with paper-wrapped 
flowers approached Danny. "Would you like 
to buy a flower so I can stay at the shelter 
tonight?" she asked. Danny jumped at the 
opportunity. "I'd love to," he replied. He 
bought five.

**Title: Teach for America: A Yale Perspective**
**Author: Ruth DeGolia**
**Page number(s): 16-17**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
more Jonathan Lehrer is considering both TPA 
' and a teaching career, he admits discussing 
,the drawbacks of the profession with his par-
ents. "My mother was concerned that it 
might not be intellectually fulfilling," he 
~explained. Sophomore Maricor Santiago's 
parents flatly denied her permission to go 
-•,into teaching. 


Yale students considering TFA seem par-
, ticularly attracted to the idea of using their 
, own privileged educational background to 
"save" low-income children from deficient 
-· schools and bad teachers. At Kopp's Dwight 
Hall appearance, eager Yalies nodded their 
i;,heads in dismay and understanding as she 
'cited statistics describing the plight of inner-
' city public school students. Although Kopp 
stressed that mef!lbers are encouraged to 
r approach their teaching assignments with 
humility, the program's effectiveness is based 
on the theory that its members can do as 
good a job or better than the sites' current 
teachers. 


However, sending thousands of inexperi-
enced young people into the nation's most 
challenged classrooms may not be the best 
solution to these problems, according to 
Gillet. "To see Teach for America as a form of 
social justice is oxymoronic," he explained. 
"How can it be social justice to place uncerti-
fied teachers in needy schools?" He suggested 
instead that experienced, veteran teachers be 
sent to these under-performing schools, since 
they may be better equipped to confront the 
difficult problems facing public schools. 


Teach for America advocates counter 
that as long as teacher shortages exist, the 
need for TFA will remain. A student at Kopp's 
Dwight Hall session questioned whether 
putting first-time teachers into the hardest 
teaching positions simply contributes to the 
existing problems of high teacher turnover 
and poor classroom leadership. 
Kopp 
responded that, at the very least, TFA mem-
bers are better than the substitutes that would 
normally fill teacher vacancies, and that prin-
cipals would rather have "a total superstar 
who stays for two years than an average 
t teacher for six years." She also noted that 6o 
1 percent ofTPA teachers continue in their posi-
tions for a third year. 


Many TFA members, such as Wagner, 
found that their lack of teaching experience 
made their job much more difficult. "It takes 
an amazing, exceptional teacher that has been 
teaching for many years to teach a class of 34 
kids and make sure everyone learns," said 
Wagner. Not only was Wagner's class large, it 
was also filled with what she called the 
school's "bad kids"-the children other 
teachers sought to exclude from theu classes 
because of emotional and behavioral prob-
lems and because they were academically 
behind. Even during her second year of teach-
ing, when her class was more diverse, she esti-
mated that three to four of her students read 
at grade level, one half read below grade level, 
and the rest could not read at all. Although 
she avoided saying that her lack of a teaching 
certificate left her less prepared to deal with 
these challenges, she admitted that she often 
resorted to library books to learn teaching 
techniques, and that she regretted missing out 
on the mentoring relationship developed dur-
ing the teacher certification process, which 
includes classroom observation and work 
under the supervision of a veteran teacher. 


Wagner also found that some of her 
coworkers resented TFA for enabling its mem-
bers to sidestep the teacher certification 
process. "The principal told us not to tell 
other teachers we were Teach for America 
because they'd be hostile that we got jobs over 
people with teaching credentials," she 
remembered. She said this resentment, which 
she only encountered among the least dedi-
cated teachers, was frustrating, but the hostil-
ity seemed to go both ways. "The bureaucra-
cy and quagmiie [new teachers] have to get 
through gives you the kind of person you 
don't want teaching. Smart people don't stand 
in that line waiting," she said. "Teachers don't 
like Teach for America because it deprofes-
sionalizes [them]. Also, it throws college kids 
into areas that have the greatest needs. But, if 
I weren't there, then who would be?" 


In addition to an intensive five-week 
1
training course, TPA encourages members to 
enroll in night or weekend alternative certifi-
cation programs through local schools and 
colleges to increase their effectiveness in the 
classroom. This form of certification has 
become increasingly popular among public 
schools facing shortages in critical areas such 
as math, science, and bilingual education. 
New Haven public schools alone currently 
boast 30 teachers with durational shortage 
area permitS, meaning they can teach for no 
more than two years while in a planned peri-
od of study to receive the appropriate degrees. 
No TFA sites are currently located in 
Connecticut. Although TPA officials said 
many factors ace considered when choosing 
sites, Connecticut's relatively strict teacher-
certification standards make TFA placements 
difficult. 


Wagner seemed irritated that despite her 
two-year stint as a teacher in the Bronx, her 
lack of formal certification prevents her from 
teaching in New Haven. "Despite the fact 
that I'm smarter and have more education 
than 
most people, I 
can't teach in 
Connecticut," she said. 


But less rigorous alternative certification 
programs are unsatisfactory solutions to 
teacher shortage problems, according to Darrel 
Capwell, American Federation of Teachers 
(AFT) spokesman and a classmate of Kopp's at 
Princeton. "Alternative certification is not a 
good substitute for making sure teachers ace 
prepared and certified beforehand," he said. 
"The fact that we ace facing a tremendous 
shortage doesn't mean that it's OK to put peo-
ple who aren't prepared into the classroom." 
Capwell emphasizes that the AFT, the largest 
teachers' union, officially supports TPA. 


Rather than encouraging elite college 
students to enter teaching through TPA, Gillet 
and other critics argue that teacher prepara· 
cion programs should be encouraged as part 
of the curriculum in competitive colleges. 
Currently, six Ivy League schools, including 
Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, boast such pro-
grams. Although the Yale community is large· 
ly receptive to the teacher's preparation pro-
gram, some community members harbor a 
"second-tier" attitude toward teaching. He 
said some professors initially responded to the 
program's creation 
with the attitude, "This is a great program 
because we have some students who really 
aren't going to make it as scientists and really 
should be teachers." 


While at Yale, Wagner attended a panel 
on New Haven public schools featuring 
experts on teaching. She remembered, 
"[Gillet] asked the audience of 50 how many 
wanted to be a teacher and he said none 
[raised their hands] and that's the problem. 
He said, 'You want to understand the prob-
lem intellectually, but you don't want to help 
solve the problem."' 


Although TPA alumni may not remain 
teachers much past their required rwo- or . 
three-year commitment, most stay in the field : 
of education. Wagner explained that one of 
TPAS main strengths is that it attracts students 
to teaching who might not have otherwise 
considered the profession. "If I hadn't done 
TPA I would have ended up studying children 
while I pursed a PHD, as my advisor wanted, 
rather than working with them," she said. 
"You think that you're doing [TPA] for only 
rwo years, but you 
it." 


According to Kopp, 6o percent of all TFA 
alumni are now working in education and 
almost three-fourths of the remaining 40 per-
cent are in some form of work with low 
income f.unilies. Johnston hopes to become a 
principal in his home state of Colorado after 
earning his law degree at Yale. Wagner found-
ed All Our Kin, a local organization that 
trains former welfare recipients to provide 
high quality childcare for their own and oth-
ers' children. Jessica Levin, another Yale grad, 
served in the TFA administration after com-
pleting her teaching commitment and is now 
Chief Knowledge Officer of The New 
Teacher Project, an organization that helps 
school districts and state departments of edu-
cation hire and develop new teachers. Other 
alumni have used their experiences in TPA to 
become "social entrepreneurs" in other relat-
ed fields. 


As long as teacher shortages exist, a need 
for new teachers will remain. Over the next 
ten years, the AFT estimates that we will need 
to recruit, train, hire, and retain rwo million 
teachers. If TPA can recruit 
teachers, then it may be able to play a significant 
role in addressing these problems. The cur-
rent economic crisis may encourage more 
applicants to TFA and teaching positions in 
general. Students are more likely to consider 
teaching as a career when they fear the unsta-
ble job market. According to Capwell, the 
teacher shortage has worsened over the past 
ten years due to the strong economy. 


If the only way to attract Yalies to teach-
ing is by convincing them they are missionar-
ies and not professionals, then TPA does serve 
a purpose. "Yale is not a place that supports 
teaching," Wagner said. "When you tell peo-
ple you want to be a teacher they look down 
on you. They used to ask me what I was going 
to do after I taught [through TFA]. Yale does-
n't value teachers." Although Yale traditional-
ly encourages public service among its stu-
dents and grads, it looks down on the profes-
sion that is arguably most effective at address-
ing disparity and injustice.

**Title: Mr. Perestroika's Manifesto**
**Page number(s): 18**

I believe, as Lenin said, that this revolutionary chaos may yet crystallize into new forms of life. -Mikhail Gorbachev 
'Last fall, a guerrilla emailer targeted three Yale professors. In a near thousand-word 
"'Political Science Manifesto," he condemned "East Coast Brahmins" as "a few men ... who 
cannot for the life-of-me compete with a third grade Economics graduate student" and 
;'baby-stuff models of political science" and demanded the swift overthrow of the political 
. 
,science establishment. "I hope this anonymous letter leads to a dismantling of the Orwellian 
system that we have in APSA [the American Political Science Association) and that we will 
~ee a true Perestroika in the discipline," the note thunderously concluded, alluding to Soviet 
political reforms of the 1980s. The author signed his name simply, "Mr. Perestroika."



**The Perestroika Movement in Political Science**
**Author: Jacob Blechen**
**Page number(s): 19-21**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Senior Yale political science 
professors James Scott, Rogers Smith (now 
at the University of Pennsylvania), and Ian Shapiro, 
as well as 14 other eminent scholars, reacted with a mix of 
bewilderment, curiosity, and commiseration. Scott, rather than delet-
ing what might have been perceived as bombastic spam, replied. Smith 
and Shapiro were more suspicious, but as the manifesto began ro cir-
culate on the internet they could not avoid the growing Perestroika 
buzz. "People who received [the message] forwarded it to others," 
Smith told me. "I didn't, but so many did that soon there were just 
hundreds of people talking about this letter around the country." 
To accommodate the flood of interest, Mr. Perestroika created a 
lisrserv on Yahoo.com, and before long academic heavyweights, includ-
ing Harvard's Theda Skocpol, the University of Chicago's Susan 
Hoeber Rudolph and John Mearsheimer, and Yale's Scott, Smith, and 
Shapiro, were fulminating online about the state of political science. 
Mr. Perestroika, it seemed, had tapped a fount of academic angst. 
•Even though none of us who received the letter would have agreed 
with every statement in ir," Smith admitted, "nonetheless it touched a 
nerve with a number of political scientists, including me, who were 
unhappy about the state of the profession." 
Mr. Perestroika bemoaned the rise in APSA of a "coterie" of schol-
ars who use highly mathematical methods. The organization's quarter-
ly journal, the Ammcan Political Scimc~ Review (APSR), has become 
OVerwhelmingly quantitative in recent years-75 percent of the articles 
fiom the last four years were either statistical or formal, according to 
the journal's editor-in contrast to the discipline's traditional emphasis 
on qualitative methods. Moreover, trendy formal methods, such as 
rational choice theory, which uses economic and mathematical models 
to derive universal political postulates, are gradually supplanting quali-
Jative techniques like fieldwork and case studies. Mr. Perestroika 
believed that the increasing emphasis on quantitative methods was 
diminishing the relevance of political science to the real world. 


Within days, communal anguish turned to collective action. In 
November, Smith sent a scathing letter with 125 signatures to APSA and 
ita 13000 members. "An anonymous scholar writing as 'Mr. 
Perestroika,' circulated to an extensive roster of political scientists a pas-
sionate memo asking many provocative, indeed painful, questions," 
Smith fumed. "Why docs the APSR and why do other prominent pro-
fes-
sional fora seem 
so intensively focused on 
technical methods, at the expense 
of the great, substantive political questions 
that actually intrigue many APSA members, as well as 
broader intellectual audiences?" Decrying mathematical hegemo-
ny in the APSR, anti-democratic governance in APSA, and a general eli-
mare of fear among graduate students and junior faculty members, he 
urged the political science community ro heed the charges. "We believe 
strongly," he concluded, "that the profession is in danger of alienating 
a larger and larger number of those who should be its active members, 
and contributing less and less to the kinds of understanding of politics 
that it is our responsibility to advance." 
For centuries, scholars of politics have studied social movements 
and upheavals. Now political science had begun a revolution of its own. 


LONG BEFORE MR. PERESTROIKA BEGAN HIS MOVEMENT, Ian 
Shapiro was crusading for many of the same principles. Ever 
since the intense mathematicization of political science in the 
1970s, Shapiro had been wary of a growing faction of scholars who pro-
moted rigorous quantitative methodologies--especially rational choice 
theory. In 1994, in response to an external review ofYale's political sci-
ence department that censoriously noted the under-representation of 
quantitative methods, Shapiro and colleague Donald Green published 
a landmark book, Patho/ogUs of Rational Choic~ Th~ory, which angrily 
challenged the value of the theory on its own terms. Rational choice, 
they argued, postulates universal hypotheses about politics that often 
do not apply to the real world. Shapiro and Green worried that such 
method-driven approaches to political science could endanger the dis-
cipline. 


The publication of Pathologies of Rational Choic~ Th~ory brought 
the schism in political science into focus. In 1995-the year rational 
choice advocates at the APSA convention allegedly motioned with tom-

sure. In the months after Rogers Smith's open 
letter, the Perestroika listserv had been filled 
with agitating and strategizing, and its mem~ 
bers recommended Scott and others to the 
nominating committee. During the spring 
Executive Director of APSA Catherine Rudder 
called Scott and told him that he had been 
nominated to run for a seat on the APSA coun~ 
cil as a member of the official slate. Scott 
assumed that he had been nominated-basi~ 
cally elected, since slates are rarely 'opposed-
because of his involvement in the movement, 
but Rudder assured him that it had "nothing 
to do with Perestroika, but rather with [his) 
qualifications." Scott was not convinced. 
Straussians, deconstructionists, an4il- interna~ 
tiona! relations specialists), Smith and 
Shapiro are more restrained. Smith maintains 
that Perestroika is not a "cohesive cadre." 
Shapiro, who has distanced himself from the 
movement since the initial flurry of activity, 
now considers himself more of an interested 
"participant in conversations." He even 
referred to Perestroika as "a little bit para~ 
noid." 


But in his candidacy, Scott declared him~ 
self the "delegate from Perestroika" and out~ 
lined broad plans for Perestroika reforms. "I 
will pr~s on every possible occasion to make 
the APSA more plural and democratic," he 
wrote. "I will do whatever I can to ensure that 
we create a professional climate where junior 
faculty and graduate students who believe 
that they represent dissenting intellectual era~ 
ditions will never again feel the need for the 
cover of anonymity to speak frankly ... The 
APSA has become, I believe, progressively 
more sectarian and oligarchic." He also 
vowed to make the APSR, which he claims 
most professors toss directly into the trash, 
more accessible to the rest of academia. "[The 
APSRJ is really a Rube Goldberg machinery 
designed to get people tenure and not have 
any relevance to the external world," he told 
me. 

The APSA objected to Scott's tendentious 
statement, requesting that he reduce it to a 
simple biography. Scott refused. All the can-
didates' statements were held for months 
before the committee finally allowed Scott's 
to stand. Perestroika, it seemed, had secured a 
victory. Like the rebellious peasants he stud-
ies, Scott suddenly found himself pushed into 
the heart of the revolution. 
"Why else would I have, aU of a sudden, a 
warm corporate embrace from APSA," he 
asked, "which had never nominated me for 
anything in the course of a JO~year career?" 
Unsure of whether to accept the nomina~ 
cion- was APSA trying to co~opt the move-
ment?-he e~mailed Perestroika headquarters 
and received a thumbs~up. "They said, 'We'll 
take what we can get,'" he remembers. "So I 
said 'What the hell?'" 
Although 
Scott 
talks 
about 
the 
Perestroika movement almost as if it were a 
revolutionary party (consisting of, as he put 
it, "people who would be at one another's 
throats in lots of other contexts," like

SUMMER, 
Perestroika movement had gained 
much ground. APSA had bowed to 
pressure and announced that it would publish 
a new journal and refund subscriptions to the 
APSR, rumors of governance reforms in APSA 
had emerged, and Scott had infiltrated the 
council. But many wondered how much 
more the movement could accomplish. 
Genuine change in the profession, some 
wrote on the listserv, could only be achieved 
in "the trenches" of colleges and universities. 
Mr. Perestroika himself warned followers not 
to feel "elated at our miniscule victories." But 
the Perestroika movement had at least man· 
aged to bring life to the decrepit, stodgy orga· 
nization upon which it originally set its crici· 
cal gaze and to the field itself Every political 
scientist in the country was talking about 
APSA, the APSR, or the condition of the disci· 
pline. As Mr. Perestroika wrote to me in an 
email, "Hopefully the wider academic com-
munity will wake up to the increasing irrele-
vance of political science to many 'real' polit-
ical questions because of its strict adherence 
to methodological orthodoxy. Our movement 
seeks to make all of us more relevant and 
more critical." Scott, Smith, Shapiro, and 
others had all "woken up" to Mr. Perestroika's 
clarion call. 

In late August, the "Perestroikaniks," as 
James Scott calls his comrades, met for the 
first time in person, at the APSA annual con-
ference 
in 
San 
Francisco. 
Prominent 
Perestroika names, junior faculty members, 
and graduate students, including some of 
Yale's crusaders, all convened to celebrate, dis-
cuss, and strategize. Wine glasses in hand, 
nearly 300 people attended a jubilant recep-
tion, and hundreds more attended panels 
with tides like "Perestroika: Undisciplined, 
Unpunished," and "Shaking Things Up? 
Future Directions in Political Science." A 
larger crowd packed the Perestroika coming-
out party than the APSA President's reception 
nc:n door. Mr. Perestroika never revealed his, 
her, or their identities. But, with so much 
accomplished and so much more to do, it 
seemed as if no one really cared.

HE TRAIL CRUSADE BEGAN back 
in 1987, when the nascent FCA 
first learned of the railroad's 
abandonment by its owners two 
weeks before federal proceedings to 
approve the process were complete. 
Until then, the news had only 
appeared in the obscure hderai 
Registtr, and just a few state 
bureaucrats and the mayors of 
the towns affected had been offi-
cially notified. Mayors usually 
pass such lands out to develop-
ers who are political allies with-
out the public ever knowing. 
Through lawsuits and a pub-
licity blitz, however, the FCA 
managed to shame their 
municipal officials into dedi-
cating the lands to a contin-uous, multi-use trail. In a 
1988 Hamden mayoral elec-
tion, the incumbent Ben 
DiNicola, 
who 
had 
promised the canal lands 
to a batch of campaign 
contributors, was defeat-
ed by John Ca.rusone, 
who ran on a pro-trail 
platform. 


Since the acquisi-
tion of federal trans-
portation funds in the 
early 1990s, the cities 
of Hamden and New 
Haven have begun to 
develop their sections 
of the trail, but goals 
have changed over the 
years. The canal no longer leads to the New 
Haven Harbor. It was cut off by street redevelopment in the 1970s.

After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the path was shortened 
again since it was prohibited from passing too near an FBI building 
downtown. If the trail is fully developed as planned, it will end near the 
city center, between the New Haven Green and the Audubon Street 
arts district. It will end there, that is, if the FCA can clear one final obsta-
cle from their path: Yale University. 

After years ofsilence and periods of open hostility to the trail pro-
ject, Yale now claims that it will not allow its section to be a "missing 
link" in the trail. The University preemptively purchased the three 
blocks of the railroad that ran through its campus before city officials 
could get their hands on them. Yale has always reserved the right to 
build on the land that it owns, and plans are underway to build a new 
engineering facility at the corner of Prospect and Trumbull Streets, 
directly adjacent to the canal. The property in question is currently a 
small parking lot upon which Yale's planners envision a soooo-square-
foot building. Despite Yale's professed intentions, canal activists are 
doubtful such a project can be completed. 

Joel Zackin points across the street from where we began our work 
today, to another weedy section of the trail that the city was supposed 
to begin developing this full. Beyond it lies the Yale campus and down-
town New Haven. Zackin emphasizes the importance to the trail of the 
three blocks Yale owns. From where we stand, kids from the Dixwell 
neighborhood could reach the New Haven Free Public Library on their 
bikes and have to cross only one street. Were the trail to end at the Yale 
campus, the kids would be forced onto Prospect Street, and from there 
they would have to run a gauntlet of some of the busiest intersections 
in the city. "We just want to know if there's a tunnel or something 
incorporated into the building design so that the trail can pass through. 
We've already got runnels, and a tunnel is a tunnel. It's okay. It's no big 
deal. What we're saying to the university is, 'Just reassure us, tell us 
how."' But that reassurance is one thing that the university refuses to 
give. 

N A SCRUBBY PIECE OF PROPElrrY near Canal and Lock 
~ 
Streets, alongside the section of the trail Zackin pointed out 
· 
to me from Science Park, there is a hump of concrete and 
rubble covered in rnugwort that stands at least three times as tall as 
Hugh Eastwood, a recent graduate of Yale College who now works for 
Yale's Office of New Haven and State Affairs. "It's kind of hard to view 
from here," says Eastwood, pointing around the hump to an open 


cavity in the 
Dixwell neighborhood, for-
. iner site of the notorious Elm 
Haven housing projects and the 
American Linen Supply Company, 
whose abandoned factory was recendy 
demolished. A small park still remains, 
and some kids who . 
probably liv!e~;====;~~=~~ 
in the pristine new middle-income 
housing development up the road are shoot-
ing hoops. Eastwood goes on with his vision 
ofwhat this neighborhood can become, ges-
turing widely with his hands. "You can kind 
of imagine what we'll do right here. The 
vision is to have a pedestrian center where 
you can walk down a canopy of trees right 
down to Canal and Lock. And you'd have 
houses over here, the new police station up 
there with a community center." He turns to 
the canal. "Here you'd have a bunch of hous-
es facing onto this pathway and houses facing 
onto the park and onto Lock Street." 

Everything in sight would become housing 
that the University would develop and sell. 
Right now, it's all just a pile of junk. 

Climbing over a foothill to the rubble 
mountain is Mike Morand, the University's 
.Associate Vice President for New Haven and 
State Affairs. He describes how the friendly 
front porches facing the trail will guarantee 
the park's safety. "The best way to have safety 
have a lot of people around watching out 
themselves, good lighcing, and good pub-
. . ...... -rv with University and community 
forces," he says. Both he and Eastwood 
that the canal and the surrounding 
though unsighdy, are not unsafe. 
even walk through it, I don't 
• 
think," Eastwood says. "The vegetation is too 
dense. You don't really have people hanging 
out down there." The eyesore will soon be 
gone, Morand promises, as years of revitaliza-
tion planning are brought to fruition. "We've 
been talking about this with the neighbor-
hood for about 20 months now, and there's a 
strong common vision. It's one of those 
things that I think will be a strong win-win-
win situation . . . The place is looking great. 
People are happy with it." On site, this is all 
hard to swallow. The mugwort is as ugly as its 
name suggests. 

Seeking a second professional opinion, I 
talked to David Barone at the City Plan 
Department. After all, the section of the 
canal that Eastwood and Morand were 
the surrounding 
though they cannot 
the dnal development, they 
come it. Barone looks like 
in his workshop: dressed in 
small-checked shirt, short and 
balding, with eyebrows that 
bush up from behind the 
frames of his spectacles. He 
mostly 
agrees 
with 
Eastwood and 
"The canal has been a 
tor-of debris, kind of an un-
cared-for strip of urban land, 
a long time." This section was 
pu r-
the first the city would develop into a hik-
ing trail precisely because of the work 
being done to revitalize the area. "It 
came together so naturally with the 
.Homes at Monterey [the new housing 
in the area) . . . Suddenly that srrip 
became the last piece of public infra-
structure that wasn't developed." 

Moreove{, the two neighborhoods 
beside this stretch of the canal, 
Dixwell and Newhallville, showed a particu-
lar need for such a space. Of all the neighbor-
hoods in New Haven, these two have the 
worst access to recreational facilities. 

As Eastwood, Morand, and I cross 
Prospect Street onro Trumbull Street and 
walk back to their office, they have less to say 
about plans for the University's section of the 
canal, which begins across Prospect Street and 
goes to Whimey Avenue. Morand will not say 
specifically how the trail will be integrated 
into the plans for the new Yale engineering 
center, which will occupy the small lot at 
Prospect and Trumbull. He does maintain, 
however, that somehow the trail will go 
through. "An architectural project has multi-
ple phases to it. lr's an ongoing, iterative 
process," he says. He. directs me to the 
University Planner, but warns that there are as 
yet no fmished plans to share. 

Barone admits that, from his perspective, 
a Yale structure at Prospect Street that 
stopped the trail's progression would be "a 
serious detriment" to the project. "I tbinl 
that the connection through Yale ro down-
town is one of the best features about thi$ 
project," he says. It provides a link bel:w~~!II!II·>Jil
seemingly distant areas. "Suddenly, it's 


Just as Barone looks like a tinker, he 
chinks like an architect, not an activist. He 
has a head for keeping straight the complex 
soliciting, analyses, contracts, processes, and 
reviews a project of this siu requires. If Yale 
says it will let the trail go through, he believes 
it will. Besides, although the Yale section is 
just across the street from the city's current 
project, it is years away in terms of execution. 
He has to build this trail one day, one mile, 
one dollar, at a time. 

m T PROSPECT STREET, where the 
~trail crosses into the campus, there 
is a monument to 
the FCA's perseverance in the 
face of University opposition: 
an expanse of wide open space. 
Were 
it 
not 
for 
Nancy 
Alderman, the space beneath 
the bridge we stand on would 
span nothing but rubble. A grad-
uate of the Yale School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies and che 
President of the FCA, Alderman refers to 
the University as an ominous, imper-
sonal "they." "What they would 
like to see, being big and us 
being small, is co have it stop 
right here," she claims. "That's 
what they've always wanted. 
That's why they wanted co fill 
in these bridges." 

It was Alderman who led 
the vanguard of a public rela-
tions blit2 to stop Yale from 
walling off the sections of the 
canal it owns beneath the 
bridges at Prospect Street, 
Temple Street, and Whitney 
Avenue, and filling the spaces 
with construction debris. Yale 
asked 
the 
Connecticut 
Department 
of 
Transportation to abandon a 
plan to install culverts, a rype 
of supporting pier, beneath 
the bridges. This would have 
allowed 
cyclists 
and 
rollerbladers to pass through 
on a future trail. Instead, Yale 
wanted the spaces beneath the 
bridges filled and blocked 
from pedestrians. And they 
asked the state not to hold a 
public hearing on the issue, Alderman says, 
which is required by law since state funds 
were being used for the project. 

Yale viewed the canal as ~ line of "very 
deep, narrow trenches which are not safe for 
joggers or bikers," and said it supported a trail 
path through campus, just not through the 
canal. This notion was anathema to trail 
activists, who are attracted to the Yale section 
precisely because of its topography: It is the 
last canal section in the city chat hasn't been 
filled in, and the only one that preserves the 
original architecture. And of course there is 
the larger goal of building an uninterrupted 
trail into downtown. Letters 
co the editor were 
penned; voices were 
raised. Eventually, 
Yale backed down. 
Now, 
rather 
chan concrete fill, 
the University may 
block the way with an 
entire building. The FCA 
has suffered this battle in 
uncharacteristic silence 
mostly because their 
hopes do not lie with 
the University. As ic 
happened, Yale chose 
Cesar Pelli & Associates to 
design the new building. 
Pelli, one of the most 
respected architects alive, is 
also a longtime supporter of 
the canal project. "We have a 
better chance with Cesar Pelli 
chan with any ocher person on 
earth," ~derman says. The Joe 
has enough room to park 20 
automobiles; it is Pelli's task co 
fit 50000 square feet of new 
building into the same 
• roughly 
triangular 
space. "I don't think 
that the Universiry 
doesn't like this trail. 
T he 
question 
is 
going to be how 
much they do like it," 
Alderman says. "We're 
asking that they love it 
so much that they'll 
do 
anything 
to 
accommodate it . .. I 
am caking the tack that they will do it if they 
can do it." Looking again ac the lot, she adds, 
"But Cesar Pelli is going co have to be smarter 
than God co figure out how it can be done." 

HOUSANOS OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY 
- ~ trample over the most valuable 
. antiques in New Haven without 
ever knowing ic. Nor do they notice when 
these architectural treasures are hacked co 
pieces by their elected officials, the remains 
discarded as worthless. At lease that's how Bill 
Brown sees it. Brown, director of the Eli 
Whitney Historical Museum in Hamden and 
a long-time member of the FCA, is passionate 
about canals, their architecture, and their 
symbolism. While we take a scroll down the 
Yale-owned portion of the canal, the portion 
of the canal the FCA is longing to save, Bill 
shows off the original 1825 bridge abutments. 

We make our way through the brush 
chat crowds the path, occasionally tripping on 
the bottles and refuse strewn about the home-
less camps chat spring up from time to time 
under the bridges. Homeless people should 
not be an issue once the trail is developed, he 
says in an aside. "When you gee lighting and 
a critical mass of people, the homeless guys 
have to find someplace else. It's never some-
thing we should be comfortable with, chat 
some can't or don't want co use the shelters. 
But it's a problem to be solved. It doesn't 
diminish the canal." 

It is always easy co disregard the history 
of the canal in questions of development, Bill 
explains. The city has done just that in previ-
ous projects when original canal archiceccure 
was destroyed and replaced. "Some people 
view history as a nuisance and something 
they'd rather not have co deal with," he says. 
"For me, chat would be regretful here. Is all 
chis important? Well, it's an irreversible com-
promise. If you let this go down, ic can never 
be rescored. Even if you cannot correct every-
thing that's here at the moment, future plan-
ners will wonder if this connection was here 
and was squandered." Bill explains chat canals 
are all about the need for connections. 

"Canals were the first public utility in 
America," he says. "This was the first 
moment when we discovered chat we've got 
co make connections between communities. 
This canal is an appropriate symbol of where 
we are today."

Today, however, the trail remains overgrown and unsightly. Bill Brown is just happy 
that it's not gone. We pass under one particularly long tunnel, the length of a city block, 
that the University wanted to fill in 1996. It is 
dark even in the midday sun. "Rather than 
find this oppressive or frightening, I find it 
exciting," Bill says, beaming. At length, we 
emerge on the other side of Whitney Avenue, 
climb up the canal's ten-foot walls, and find 
ourselves among students from the Creative 
Arts Workshop and the Neighborhood Music 
School. We've successfully navigated from the 
Dixwell neighborhood to the Arts Center, but 
we're a filthy and disturbing sight to the elementary schoolers: Bill, a hefty six-feet-two 
with a pirate-like eye-patch, bends over panting, lamenting his lost youth. I brush the dirt 
from my jeans and notice my hands are 
scraped and bleeding. 

Recent developments indicate that the 
passage from Dixwell, let alone from 
Northampton, won't be getting easier anytime soon. A few days after my journey with 
Bill, the City of New Haven announced that, 
since no contractor could be found for its low 
bid, plans for the canal were being reconsidered to find ways of bringing down costs. The 
groundbreaking ceremony was postponed 
indefinitely, though David Barone said that 
they hope to begin work sometime in the 
spring. When I contacted Pam Delphenich, 
the university planner, she could not tell me 
how exactly Yale's new engineering complex 
will accommodate the trail, and Cesar Pelli & 
Associates, who instructed me to clear all 
questions through a Yale representative, could 
not be reached for comment. Delphenich 
repeated, however, that the trail will somehow 
go through.


AT LEAST ONE MAN will be happy if none of 
these thorny, bureaucratic obstacles 
is ever removed and the canal 
stays how it is: overgrown, impassable, and virtually deserted. His 
name is Pete*, and I find him at Harmony 
Place, a community center for the homeless 
in New Haven housed in a Lutheran church 
on downtown Orange Street, two blocks 
from where the Farmington Canal trail will 
blend into city streets and extend to the 
waterfront, should its development ever pass 
through the Yale campus and down this far. 

Pete and some friends live beneath a 
bridge in a shantytown that I've noticed 
before. It's a spot that might not look out of 
place on the outskirts of Caracas or Peshawar. 
A tent stands amid strewn boxes, newspapers, 
food wrappers, bottles, cans, and stray articles 
of clothing. No trees grow beneath the 
bridge, due to the heavy shade, so it is a rare 
spot where the weeds are not overgrown and 
blocking the way. The pungent smell of urine 
fills the air. 

Born in Detroit, Pete has lived in New 
Haven for 37 years, year-round in the canal 
for the past three. He has one or two friends 
who live there as well, though others occasionally join them. "They kick you out of 
those shelters at the drop of a hat," he 
explains. "You blink and they'll kick you 
out." Pete will usually take such cases in, but 
only if he knows that they won't make trouble. That way, the group gets no trouble in 
return. 

Their place is nice, Pete says—shady in 
summer and without a wind-chill in winter. 
And they're seldom bothered—occasionally 
by the police, but more often by drunken bar 
patrons. "They come down there to get laid," 
he says. "And we see 'em—just the shadows 
really, bouncing up and down on the walls." 
As for the animals, Pete explains, "We don't 
bother 'em." They see an opossum, a raccoon, 
and even occasionally a skunk, who is not 
welcome but is never chased away. "We did 
have an old owl down there too," he tells me. 
"We'd be ass-ing all night, and he wouldn't 
give a shit. He'd be sitting up there, and every 
now and again he'd glide through, and you'd 
just hear a squeak. He was there last year, but 
he ate all the rats and then left." 

Pete himself has no plans for moving 
anytime soon; he is unfazed by the news that 
development on the canal may soon begin. 
He's heard it all before, he claims, and puts no 
stock in it. He even attended an FCA meeting 
once, and left unimpressed. If it's Yale property he lives on, it'll be at least ten years, he 
reckons, before he'll have to move. He doesn't 
have much faith in the bureaucratic process. 
If he does have to move, however, he won't 
mind too much, so long as it's for a purpose. 
"But we don't want to move," he adds, "if 
they ain't never gonna finish it."

left Bosnia in 1992, when I was ten. War had broken out that year and would not end until 1996, at 
vvhich point the country was cut in two. My hometown Visegrad is now part of the autonomous Serbian 
Republic. Because I am a Bosnian-Muslim, I cannot return. I go to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, instead. 
Displaced from my home, I returned last summer after spending half of my life in New York City. I took 
photographs throughout my four-month stay in Bosnia. Looking at the images when I returned to Yale, 
I was struck by how removed I am from them. I was an insider observing my country through an out-
sider's lens. No matter the subject of my photographs-shelled buildings, empty parks whose trees were 
cut down for fuel during the war, decrepit Communist housing projects-! observed from an uncom-
fortable distance. I could not divorce my view from my memories of the pre-war urban landscape of 
Sarajevo. I was looking at Bosnia trying to rebuild itself out of the shambles of war, still picking up pieces 
of the fallen Communist regime and facing a continued refugee crisis within its borders. These pho-
tographs reveal my separation from Bosnia; they also reflect my longing to return.

HE DEPARTMENT OF SociAL SERVICES (oss) on Basset Street is a 
quiet place on a Friday afternoon. Agents behind a glass partition 
call up patrons from the rows of plum-colored plastic chairs that fill the 
large, 
dimly-lit 
waiting 
room . .,......,.---.!!"'--~-.-----~-------.....
Individuals and parents with children trickle in and out, taking care of 
errands before the weekend. Today,, 
people quickly get what they came for, 
but on a busier day the line can take 
hours. 

A youngish mother, lips lined 
with black pencil, lightened hair 
pulled into a high ponytail, waits for 
her name to be called while her twin 
daughters play. I cautiously approach 
her, hoping to learn what welfare 
reform feels like from the inside. 

While she declines to tell me her 
name, she readily shares her story of 13 years in the system. Shortly after 
graduating from Wilbur Cross High School, she gave birth to her first 
child, now nine years old. When things got rocky with the child's 
father, there was only one place to go-back to her mother. Together 
the three wandered from apartment to apartment, relying on welfare 
cash assistance for survival. Finally, the woman landed a job at the Fair 
Haven Super K.mart, but was soon pregnant with twins and out of 
work again. "Now, for me to get work, it's a lot harder because [the 
twins] take up a lot of my time," she explains. "It's hard to get day-
care." Not long ago, she reentered the workforce, this time as a bus 
aide. But even with an income, welfare pays the bills. "I'm paying 
$600 rent. That leaves me 39 dollars left to my name as far as cash goes. 
So I'm basically struggling." In 16 months, her welfare payments will 
stop forever. 

Welfare reform has arrived in New Haven. On October 1, 112 New 
Haven families hit their lifetime limit for state cash assistance; they can 
no longer receive any welfare money. Another 39 were dropped from 
the welfare rolls on November 1, and on the first of every month from 
now on, dozens of families will lose cash benefits, often their only 
source of income. The oss estimates that before 
the end of the year, 1000 Connecticut children 
will be affected by welfare reform. Another 690 
families will enter their final extension in the 
same period.

With the economic bubble of the nineties 
already a memory and unemployment on the 
rise, nearly all Americans are preparing for lean-
er times, but for those exiting welfare, the 
future looks especially uncertain. Last August, 
New Haven community organizations-home-
less shelters, food banks, and advocacy 
groups-met for the first time to discuss the 
impending exodus of welfare recipients. The 
state had set the date of termination five years 
before, but hadn't taken the initiative to plan for hundreds of destitute 
families. Now, shelters are full, funds are limited, resources are 
strapped, and no one knows where the families will go. 


D
URING THE 1992 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, Bill Clinton famous-
ly vowed "to end welfare as we know it." Connecticut beat 
Clinton and Congress to the punch, instituting a statewide wel-
fare-to-work program over a year before national reform. By January 
1996, Republican Governor John Rowland had reduced cash payments 
and instituted a time-limited benefit program. Eight months later, 
President Clinton signed the "Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act" into law. Commonly known as "wel-
fare reform," the act ended the Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children program, replacing it with federal block grants for state-
administered welfare-to-work programs. These block grants came with 
a stipulation: a five-year limit on welfare payments. 


"There's a general feeling that if we just 
give families a kick in the pants they'll get it 
together," says Cheri Quickmire, a New 
Haven organizer for Christian Community 
Action. "Connecticut's convoluted welfare 
laws-some of the strictest in the country-
reflect 
that kick-in-the-pants attitude. 

Families face an initial cutoff period of 21 
months for cash benefits under Jobs First, the 
current welfare-to-work program. (If a recip-
ient gets cash assistance for a single day of a 
calendar month, that month counts toward 
the limit.) Those who attend the mandatory 
job training and make good-faith efforts to 
find work may apply for six-month exten-
sions. Originally, the number of extensions 
was unlimited. However, effective October 
of this year, a maximum of three extensions 
was imposed, for a total of 39 months of cash 
assistance (freeing up between $17 and $28 
million dollars for the state, depending on 
whom you ask). 

Those who can demonstrate two or more 
barriers to employment, like drug addiction 
or severe mental health problems, may extend 
their benefits for up to 60 months. A clinical-
ly depressed mother whose child has chronic 
asthma, for example, might qualify for an 
additional three extensions. Only one excep-
tion to the 60-month rule exists: violent 
domestic abuse rendering an adult unemploy-
able. Aside from that, families are on their 
own. "One of the biggest points is that peo-
ple are being abandoned," says Quickmire. 
"The state calls them 'leavers' but a lot of 
these folks don't have any other choices." 

Those dropped from the rolls may still 
qualify for other benefits, such as food 
stamps, Medicaid, and child care. Families 
with federal housing subsidies keep their 
homes, and their rent falls to zero if welfare 
payments were their only income. "But service 
providers and government officials still 
foresee a crisis in the near future-one with 
no easy solution. 

S
o WHAT HAPPENS when cash benefits 
vanish? "The state made it clear that 
they weren't doing anything" to help the tran-
sition, says Quickmire. "There's no safety net 
any longer." 

Families finishing their last 
month of cash assistance receive no direction 
from the state beyond a mandatory exit inter-
view at the oss. In it, social workers tell them 
about other kinds of benefits for which they 
may still qualify and direct them to 2-1-1 
Infoline, a state-contracted referral service 
run by the United Way of Connecticut which 
distributes information about local service 
providers. 

Infoline services have proven woefully 
inadequate. 
"So far the experience of the 
United Way is that they're getting very few 
calls," says Ellen Scalettar, a former state leg-
islator who is now an advocacy coordinator 
for Connecticut Voices for Children, "and it's 
still unclear what the United Way can do 
when they do call." Quickmire questions the 
practicality of the referral service. "Infoline's 
not going to find people money. It's going to 
give them the number to our shelter and we're 
going to tell them it's already full." 

Most social service agencies have long 
been operating at or near capacity levels. 
Nevertheless, for many families, these non-

New Haven's six transitional centers for homeless youth. The 
blinds are usually shut and the lights almost always off. Standing on the 
sidewalk, I did not hear any voices coming from inside. Like the people 
it serves, it is almost invisible. 

Any resident of New Haven can tell you about their encounters 
with the city's homeless. Yet few can tell of their experiences with the 
homeless population under 25-a population with which we might 
have the most in common. 

New Haven formally acknowledged the problem of homeless 
youth a year and a half ago, when it formed a working committee to 
research the experiences of runaways from the city and its surrounding 
communities. The task has been difficult. When Eric Ashton, a former 
employee of City Hall and a member of the committee, was asked how 
many runaways call the streets of New Haven home, his response was, 
"We don't know the numbers. I have no clue. They're a population that 
is invisible." 

As I walked into the shelter, the "invisible" youth no longer had the 
streets for camouflage. In M Umoja House, two young men live with a

governmental service agencies are the only 
resource left. The state of Connecticut is 
relying on established service organizations to 
handle the flood of new clients with their 
existing levels of staffing and funding. Few in 
New Haven think that organizations will be 
able to handle increasing demand. "Everyone 
knows it's not sufficient," says Bob Solomon, 
director of the New Haven Housing 
Authority. 

"The people in services in our 
community are highly competent and dedi-
cated, but there isn't enough money." 
Money rations look lean for the shelters 
and pantries on the front lines this winter. 
Limited budgets and no additional state 
funding mean that service organizations 
won't be able to expand their operations. 
Moreover, the post-September II spirit of 
generosity that inspired so many donations to 
relief work and the American Red Cross may 
have inadvertently diverted d~nations away 
from smaller non-profits. 
According to 
Solomon, "there are reports that giving to 
agencies not connected with September n is 
suffering." At the state level, money will be 
equally hard to come by: On October 1, 
Governor Rowland signed legislation cutting 
$88 million from the budget for the coming 
year. Much of this will come out of social ser-
vices funding. 

Shelters are preparing for this winter's 
welfare cutoffs, but already, long before the 
first snow, there is little they can do. As early 
as August, local men's, women's, and family 
shelters were full, except Columbus House, 
which had a few open beds. Demand for 
beds stayed unusually high through the sum-
mer, when need normally lessens. In 
response, the New Haven Board of Aldermen 
made the unprecedented decision to keep 
open the emergency overflow shelter, a facili-
ty usually reserved for the colder months. 
One shelter worker, who wished to remain 
anonymous, lamented that even before cash 
assistance limits took effect, her shelter could 
not meet the needs of 
the community. "We 
turn so many people 
away all the time," 
she said. "Now it's 
getting worse. People are staying longer and 
longer." Allison Cunningham, the Executive 
Director of Columbus House, blames a lack 
of affordable housing for the longer shelter 
stays. "We can't get people out of the shelters, 
because where are they going to go?" 

Cunningham's question remains 
unanswered for most families coming off wel-
fare, but based on past experience, service 
workers can make some predictions. Families 
may not los·e their housing for some time 
after their benefits end; eviction takes time 
and some may have some money in the bank. 
When there is nothing left, families will like-
ly turn to relatives, saving the shelters as a 
final resort. If the family shelters are full, par-
ents will move in to single adult shelters, leav-
ing their children with relatives or friends. In 
the most dire cases, entire families will simply 
end up on the sueet.

monchly visits to local pantries to keep food

to NataSha Ray, president of Mothers For 
Justice, an advocacy group for homeless 
women. 

"Unless there's more money that 
goes through the food bank, the food pantries 
are not going to have enough food to give the 
families in New Haven." Some pantries are 
already experiencing difficulties. I called 2.11-
Infoline to find out where a hungry person in 
New Haven could go for groceries.

'M ALREADY SEEING MORE entire families 
walking in off the street waiting to see if 
there's housing," says Quickmire. These 
are grim rimes for New Haven's service work-
ers. 

As the fallout from welfare reform 
becomes evident, service providers are frus-
trated by the tardiness and meagerness of the 
state's response. "They claim they are starting 
to think about how this is going co affect 
them," a shelter worker remarked. 
"This 
should have been a long-term process." 

Despite state failure to provide a workable 
transition for families exiting welfare, local 
service providers maintain their efforts. They 
continue to deliver their services at maximum 
capacity. What's more, they are organizing to 
track families as they leave welfare, to prevent 
them from simply disappearing. 

An ad-hoc "collaborative" spear-headed 
by Quick.mire, Scalettar, and Barbara Tinney 
of New Haven Family Alliance emerged last 
August. A main objective is to collect reliable 
data about families leaving welfare--
Connecticut has failed to establish any com-
prehensive data collection project of its own. 
With new survey results in hand, the collabo-
rative hopes to lobby the legislature to redi-
rect funds towards social services. Christian 
Community Action has been circulating a 
petition statewide pointing out that without 
benefits many families will be living on 
poverty wages or nothing at all and calling on 
the state to use its "extraordinary resources 
and wealth to meet the basic needs of all 
Connecticut's children." 

Future advocacy goals are even more 
ambitious. "We're pushing for the restoration 
of cash assistance and the safety net," says 
Quickmire. Although the legislature ofren 
responds more favorably to the opinions of its 
suburban constituents than city-dwellers, the 
New Haven collaborative hopes they can 
change minds by putting a face to the blight 
created by welfare reform. 

They may be 
right. "The legislature ofren reacts to emer-
gency situations," says Bob Solomon. "It's 
ofren reactive, not proactive." In the long 
run, the legislature may act to improve life for 
Connecticut's poor, but it can't be counted on 
for immediate assistance. "There's not going 
to be any option for cash this year," says 
Quickmire. 

New Haven 
city government 
knows that wel-
fare reform and 
winter will test its 
"no freeze" policy 
of turning no one 
away from a shel· 
ter. Yet it remains 
committed 
to 
keeping 
people 
warm. 
Shelters 
cost money, and 
New Haven is 
one of the rare 
cities that spends cax dollars on the homeless. 
In faa, New Haven is one of the few local 
communities willing to provide services to 
the poor at all. Solomon says, "If you need 
emergency housing or food, New Haven is a 
place where you're more likely to get it." The 
same is true of eldercare and psychiatric ser· 
vices. Many of the towns surrounding NeW 
Haven choose not to provide social services.

ing up in their municipalities. "The suburbs

regional plans, especially when it comes to 
alleviating pressures on cities to provide ser-
vices to poorer people," says Solomon. 

Therefore New Haven social services 
must ease the burden of poverty for people 
from across the region, not just in town. This 
is no accident. Anecdotes of 
from neighboring towns 
homeless people at the Green 
substantiated by the number of 
of-towners in local shelters. 
October, the New Havm 
reported that berween 27 and 31 
cent of shelter residents come 
other parts of the state or even from 
other states. 

According to Phil 
Voigt, the alderman who heads 
Haven's finance committee, the 
contributes directly to the dispro-
portionate burden on New Haven's 
shelters. "We have documentation 
that the state itself has sent people from the 
correctional agencies and literally dropped 
them off at New Haven's doorstep." 

Voigt's solution? Sue the state. "What 
we're looking for is that the surrounding state 
and towns pay their fair share," says Voigt. 
"We're sort of confident that this will work." 
Thomas Ude of the New Haven Corporation 
Counsel has been working with Voigt to 
develop a legal strategy that will ensure that 
the suit makes it to the higher courts. Ude 
hopes to have a working outline of the lawsuit 
by November 14. Voigt says he would like to 
issue the lawsuit as quickly as possible. "This 
welfare reform is not really welfare reform. 
It's just shifting the burden from federal gov-
ernments and states onto the municipalities." 

If Voigt and the collaborative get their 
way, New Haven may increase its capacity to 
provide emergency services to welfare leavers. 
As a short-term objective, this is crucial. Still, 
everyone recognizes that truly curtailing 
poverry will require a much deeper commit-
ment from the state than emergency relie£ 
·There's no investment in families who are 
low- or no-income on the part of the state, 
and I think it's criminal, frankly, in a time 
when we're the wealthiest per-capita state in 
the country," says Quickmire. 

Securing that kind of long-term invest-
~ ment in education, day-care and other ser-
vices will require challenging the prevailing 
v wisdom about welfare reform and poverty. 
Says Solomon, "People think if you reduce 
welfare rolls, you've succeeded." Even involv-
6 iog those kicked off welf.ue in the public con-
,f l'ersation is no easy task. Quickmire knows 
lo 
this from experience. "[Welfare leavers] don't 
want to talk about it. There's tremendous 
stigma attached to being poor now. They're 
made to feel like they've done something 
wrong even if they've played by all the rules." 

IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME TALKING with 
service workers, you notice a persistent ten-
sion in their outlook. On the one hand, their 
rhetoric often takes on the character of 
doomsday prophecy. They grimly rattle off a 
laundry list of problems that will proliferate 
in the coming months. "I think the crime 
rate is going to go up [and we'll see an] 
increase in the drug community because these 
women are going to do whatever they need to 
do to feed their kids and put a roof over their 
heads," Ray predicts. 

Another explained, 
"We're being trained to think we're going to 
have to deal with lots more depression. If you 
don't know how you're going to feed your 
kids the next day, you would be depressed 
too." But much of the time, service workers 
find themselves in the same position as their 
clients: powerless to look beyond the next

T COULD HAVE BEEN ANY THURSDAY NIGHT. J had just returned from 
my second Durfee's run for Swedish Fish, my Chaucer paper was still 
not writing itself, and my bare-walled single was feeling lonelier than 
ever. I was bored, and I had to do something about it. I needed dis-
traction, something to take my thoughts off schoolwork. I was in the 
mood for the excitement you sometimes feel before a big night at a 
party or a bar filled with people, but I wanted to experience it without 
leaving my desk. As I clicked on "chat" and followed the computer 
screen to "northeast region," I began wondering how many other Yalies 
would also be online. And would I see anyone I knew? Perhaps all the 
rooms would already be full. As the dialogue box popped up and I 
selected "Connecticut 1," I asked what I was really looking for online 
Bv· J.C. R£1NDL 
tonight. While I typed "Jordanzo Y" in the "name" box, a flood of pos-
sibilities hit me: Within the next 30 minutes I could conceivably find 
myself with a new best friend, free psychological counseling, a summer 
position as a houseboy, or even undressed in a random Stiles single with 
someone I'd never met before. I pressed the "enter" button, and instant-
ly a pea-green page filled the screen, along with a list of 50 names, 
among them "JasonCT29," "Yalecub_24,'' "oldnavyboyr9,'' "yale-
boyzo," and, my favorite, "spankyCT5'6_18obighairychest." Five of the 
so had "Yale" or "Y" in their screen name. The top of the screen read 
•welcome to Gay.com." 

Gay.com is a website devoted to supplying information on nearly 
every subject related to homosexuality. One can use it to search for area 
suppott groups, sift through gay-related news headlines, shop for 
clothes, search the personals, or log on to local gay chat rooms. I use it 
mainly to find sex. Clicking on the "chat" function reveals a list of 
men's chat room headings with locations all over the world, with four 
different regional rooms for the United Scares. Each heading is divided 
into hundreds of individual rooms, ranging from "Hrv: Positive" to 
•College Jocks" to "New York City." Each room holds up to 50 chat-
ters, who can create their own name and one-sentence descriptions. 
Some are quite tame: "Hey guys 19 y/o college boy with pic." Some are 
more suggestive: "Who wants to sneak into my house and not wake up 
my roommate?" Others seem to echo the thoughts of many Yalies who 
log on: "What's _up? Looking for friends, maybe more." 

Looking at everyone's description is like browsing through mer-
chandise on eBay. Many users give their "stars," a quick physical 
description of their age, height, weight, hair and eye color, and often 
genital size. Once you find an "item" of interest, click to enter a one-
on-one dialogue that could eventually lead to having that object rushed 
to your doorstep. My first time logging on I was surprised by how lit-
tle talking goes on in the chat room itself, since most of the action is 
taking place in personal instant messages. Any time after JPM, one can 
find at least one other Yale student in the three Connecticut rooms, and 
Sunday through Thursday after midnight, there can be as many as eight 
Yalies at once. 

Since I first visited the site out of curiosity as a freshman in the fall 
of 1999, more and more Yalies have been logging onto Gay.com. Back 
in 1999 more graduate students than undergraduates seemed to inhab-

it the rooms, but lately the balance has been tipping toward under-
graduates. I discovered Gay.com through friends, although many gay 
students first heard about it when the site was mentioned recently in a 
Rolling Swne article "To Be Gay At Yale." 

If someone is only interested in looking for sex partners and does-
n't want to deal with corning our, all he needs is ten minutes, a pseu-
donym, a laprop, and a roommate back home for the weekend, and no 
one outside of his "hook-up" will ever know who he is and what he is 
doing. One graduate student told me that using Gay.com can "wipe the 
slate clear; you can play with the closet, and break down the boundaries 
between being in and out of the closet." 

The anonymity is also hugely important for closeted students, who 
can log on and create a fictitious name and identity for themselves. 
Students no longer have to our themselves by showing up to Lesbian-
Gay-Bisexual-Transgendered Co-op meetings in order to meet and talk 
to their first gay friends; they can log on and have over 50 gay people 
eager to talk to them without having to leave their room. Gay.com 
allows them to be a patt of a gay Yale community, without exposing 
themselves. I think this anonymity is positive-it allows people to 
explore their sexuality without being labeled as bisexual or gay. A per-
son's newly discovered sexuality can be a big topic of conversation at 
Yale, and some people don't want to be talked about. Anonymity can 
be important for almost anybody, since having "Yalie looking for action 
NOW" in my description could become quite embarrassing on my way 
to Spanish the next morning if someone I knew were to ask if I got 
lucky last night. 


On Gay.com, conventional dating 
behavior does not apply. I don't feel the same 
pressure to invite my hook-up to dinner or 
call him three days afterwards. One student 
told me he even prefers not to hook up with 
Yalies, and instead goes after people from 
around New Haven to avoid any awkward 
campus confrontations. This is not at all 
uncommon-strippers, security officers, and 
firemen have all wandered into Yale dorms 
because of Gay. com. Since the computers 
are all about directness, efficiency, and 
objectivity, it is fitting that hook-ups 
planned by computer tend to get right to 
the point-
the action-bypassing nor-
mal barriers or social conventions. If you 
are tired of having to meet people 
through your circle of friends or extracur-
riculars, and then _having to make small 
talk or consume alcohol to get "in the 
mood" before the festivities begin, 
Gay.com can be a utopia.

not, people lie about their weight, their age, 
or the time they spend at the gym, inflate 
their "Hot-or-Not" rating by three points, 
and give measurements in centimeters but 
label them inches. It seems as though these 
people believe that once they go through the 
trouble of showering, putting on the special-
occasion Abercrombie boxers, and inviting 
you up to their room, you won't 
care if the advertised six-pack is 
actually buried under an addi-
tional 35 pounds. It is common 
for people to ask, "u got a pic?" 
which should be a good way of 
assessing compatibility But the 
pictures often are too good to be 
true. My friends and I have 
received the exact same picture 
of a well-built, bleached-blond 
teenage boy in his backyard from 
four different people. I myself 
have also fallen victim to 
the 
dreaded 
"Photoshop 
date," 
where someone made his double chins disap-
pear with a mouseclick. 

EVERTHELESS, despite the raunchy 
biographies and screen names, 
Gay.com is used for more then hooking up 
with strangers in the middle of the night. Eric 
Moga, a psychology department research 
assistant, told me he logged on to Gay.com a 
lot after arriving in New Haven this summer 
not knowing anyone. Unfamiliar with the 
city, Moga said, "I used it to find where the 
clubs were, and to meet new friends." But he 
found mixed results over the summer: "It has-
n't worked for friends because the people were 
either socially inept or closeted boys." Online 
chat rooms became a social support network 
for him because "If you have something on 
your mind, you'll definitely find someone to 
listen." One person I talked to finds that he 
usually logs on "mainly from boredom," 
though, when nature has its way, "Every so 
often for sex." Another undergraduate 
describes how he logs on "Only when I'm 
procrastinating from doing work--once a 
week at most. I let myself sit in the chat room 
and see who messages me. Sometimes it's 30-
somethings from off-campus who act all 
sketchy. By the time it's a Yale student I'm too 
busy to talk." 

When talking about Gay.com and other 
chat rooms with many gay students at Yale, I 
sensed that people were ashamed to admit 
42 
they go online. This fear seems to come from 
a belief that in admitting that he meets peo-
ple using a computer, someone is admitting 
that incompetence in real life has forced him 
to use computers to find friendship and sex. 
One Yale student becomes irate when people 
associate his use of Gay.com with despera-
tion. He emphasizes that the function of chat 
rooms for some people are not much different 
from what a bar provides for many others: a 
place where people can meet new friends and 
find someone to listen to them. He claims, 
"It's a normal community. It's not about des-
peration." 

Although many gay students know 
about Gay.com, some refuse to go online. 
This is tragic, because in Yale's gay scene the 
shelves can always use restocking. And while 
Gay.com has been a hit within the gay male 
community, there seems to be no use within 
Yale's lesbian community. There are ten dif-
ferent geographical room headings for men to 
enter, but women are left with only one head-
ing: "worldwide women." Lauren Mangini, 
the coordinator for Yalesbians, says it has 
never occurred to her to explore Gay.com, 
"Even if Yale is a barren desert of a dating 
scene, it's probably better than online--that 
seems kinda sketch." Mangini suggests that 
women value face-to-face interaction more 
when meeting people. Though I think men 
are just more willing to have sex with 
strangers. 

Despite all its possibilities, Gay.com has 
brought more disappointment than satisfac-
tion. After rwo years of using Gay.com, I 
often find myself asking, "Am I the only per-
son on here who actually looks like his 
But most disappointment on Gay.com is 
brought on by what I refer to as the "wishful 
thinking fallacy". This is when we fill in the 
unknown details about the person we are 
talking to online to make him what we want 
him to be. For example, if someone were to 
type "This New Haven winter makes me 
want to lie in bed all day and think of the 
beach," I would internally process this remark 
as, "Come over and let's spoon under the cov-
ers all night, and the warmth will remind me 
of my summer days surfing and lifeguarding 
at the beach, and oh, did I mention I just 
turned 17?" The excitement of creating such 
fantasies can keep one logged onto Gay.com 
well after bedtime. The source of these fan-
tasies, what really keeps you online, is the 
faint hope that the person you have spotted 
around campus, and dreamed about since 
freshman year, whom you have always hoped 
would someday rurn out to be gay, may per-
haps 
be 
person 
hiding 
behind 
"Yalekid2o."

**Freedom and Time: A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government**
**Author: Anya Kamenetz**
**Page number(s): 43-45**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
\\ y OU SEE, IT's UKE THIS," EXPLAINS WANDA, crack analyst for Action McNews in 
Tom Tomorrow's comic This Modern World. "The terrorists HATE FREE-
DOM." Very few explanations of our current situation have gone beyond this thick-
black-line simplicity. When politicians or pundits talk about a threat to "American 
values" or "democratic freedoms" they're using code words, and assuming that 
everyone has the same decoder ring. That's why it's such a pleasure to read a care-
fully reasoned and gracefully written book interrogating these overused and ill-
defined phrases. If nothing else, Jed Rubenfeld's Frmiom and Tim~ is the prod-
uct of a cooler head prevailing. 

Rubenfeld's project, as the title suggests, is no less than to redefine free-
dom, and then to re-reconcile constitutional government with democracy on 
the basis of this new understanding. Rubenfeld, Robert R. Slaughter 
Professor of Law at Yale Law School, was a philosophy major at Princeton. 
Hence the unusual composition of the book-at once a philosophical trea-
tise, a piece of legal theory, and a work of cultural criticism. 

Part 1 begins with a discussion of the posrmodern predicament. We 
commonly take freedom to mean living in the present. In pursuit of this 
freedom, we reject the shackles of history, revere youth, fear death, and 
prostrate ourselves on the altar of instant gratification : "Obey your 
thirst." But this ideal is, in practice, both exhausting and profoundly 
boring. "'Nothing new under the sun' is a pre-modern sentiment," 
writes Rubenfeld . "Only in the modern era does being new itself 
become old, opening up an ennui unknown to prior times." 

This may sound like coffeehouse existentialism, and it more or 
less is. Does this dilemma have any bearing on our day-to-day exis-
tences? Rubenfeld is strongest on the subject of how wispy philo-
sophical constructS and unexamined assumptions make their way 
into our daily lives in the form of laws. Our poll-driven political 
life is based on the assumption, dating 
back to Rousseau, that the ultimate 
democratic act is an act of speech. The 
idea that self-government is or should be 
the "voice of the people," discussion, 
debate, dialogue, instandy expressed and 
instantaneously registered, is the political 
analogue to the ideal of life in the 
moment. 

Here, Rubenfeld enters into a debate 
in American legal theory raging back to 
Jefferson. The "speech-based" model of 
democracy opens up a contradicti~n 
between self-government and the cofisti-
tution in its basic function: as a guarantee 
of civil rights and civic procedures against 
the vagaries of popular opinion. As long 
as "the voice of the people" is the ultimate 
justification for government, no written 
law, no matter how "fundamental," can 
stand in contradiction to popular will. 

Only a strong constitution can 
defend democracy, but it must withstand 
democracy as well. Rubenfeld dismisses 
prior attempts to resolve this contradic-
tion with reference to "the voice of the 
people" past, present, or future. One can't 
logically uphold the Constitution against 
present popular will on the basis of pre-
sent popular will. Nor can consitutional 
rights be justfied with reference to the 
"founding moment" -why should the 
will of the dead take precedence over that 
of the living? Nor yet can anti-majority 
rights be justified on the basis of future 
majority will-that way lies totalitarian-
ism. 

Rubenfeld goes even further in his 
attack on the popular will, perhaps the 
most cherished truism in all of American 
politics. "Collective will is a fiction," 
Rubenfeld writes, "... a 'meaningless,' 
'irrational,' 'self-contradictory' fiction. 
Hence we should stop thinking of democ-
racy in terms of collective will and collec-
tive self-governance." He supports this idea 
with a complex piece of analytic philoso-
phy called a "Condorcet paradox." In any 
election with three or more candidates 
where the public can register both a first 
and second choice (as in a primary and 
runoff, for example), there is a chance the 
results will be dose to the following: one 
third for Bush first and Gore second, one 
third for Gore first and Nader second, and 
one third for Nader first and Bush second. 
That means a solid two-thirds "majority 
will" simultaneously prefers each candidate 
to the two others. This formal analysis may 
strike some as chicanery, but it does point 
to a lamentable simplicity in our under-
standing of the term "voice of the people." 

Having undermined our form of gov-
ernment, Rubenfeld must find a new justi-
fication for constitutional democracy. In 
Part II of the book, Rubenfeld re-construes 
the relationship between constitutionalism 
and self-government. These sections of the 
book are where Rubenfeld's intelligent, 
economical writing style is most helpful, as 
he walks the reader calmly over rocky theo-
retical ground. By factoring in the dimen-
sion of time, he solves the apparent contra-
dictions in the variables "self," "society," 
and "law." It takes time for a person to 
become a human being, it takes time for a 
people {what Rubenfeld calls a "populari-
ty") to become a polity, and it takes time 
for an injunction to become a law. "Law is 
prophecy," he says, quoting Oliver Wendell 
Holmes. A law, proclaimed at time one, has 
no meaning until it is upheld at time two. 
A person's decisions, made at time one, 
have no import until they are acted upon at 
time two. Therefore the ultimate democratic 
act is not speech at all but writing-an utter-
ance deepened by time. Constitutional provi-
sions are written commitments made by a 
people to itself, and in their fulfillment over 
time they make a people a people. 

Rubenfeld calls his constitutionalist phi-
losophy "commitmentarian," and his defini-
tion of commitment needs some elucidation. 
He draws an impor-
tant but subtle dis-
tinction 
between 
commitment 
and 
what he calls "pre-commitment," 
which also separates him from previous con-
stitutional theorists. He uses a literary refer-
ence that has become a trope of constitution-
al theory: Ulysses orders his sailors to tie him 
to the mast, knowing that his reason will 
abandon him when he hears the sirens call-
ing. Rubenfeld says this is in fact a metaphor 
for pre-commitment: Because of what you do 
at time one, you have no choice but to obey 
at time two, no matter how you might wish 
to change your mind. This form of constitu-
tionalism bears some relation to the 
Hobbesian social contract. Commitment, on 
the other hand, as Rubenfeld defines it, is a 
self-lawgiving. You may very well have exter-
nal reasons to follow through on a commit-
ment, but your most important reason is that 
you have an obligation to yoursel£ In a beau-
tiful 
reversal of the Ulyssean image, 
Rubenfeld points out that constitutional 
commitments actually tend to be made, like 
marriage proposals, in the heat of passion, 
their strictures guaranteeing against the 
"seduction of ... everyday, cost-benefit, pref-
erence-maximizing rationality." 

Rubenfeld spends Part III of the book 
outlining how his "commirmentarian" philoso-
phy applies to matters of constitutional law 
like discrimination and the right to privacy. 
Here he shows himself to be a solid liberal, 
defending the constitutionality of affirmative 
action, for example: "Racial minorities are 
unequal to other minorities under current law 
... Something has gone profoundly wrong in 
constitutional interpretation when 
t.he 
Fourteenth Amendment is read, as it is today, 
to make racial minorities virtually the only 
minorities in our entire legal system that can-
not be singled out for favorable treatment." 

As the more partisan portions of the work, 
these chapters are marginally less persuasive, 
or maybe it's only that they are denser in legal 
jargon. 

Rubenfeld himself told me in an inter-
view that this book, with its offbeat blend of 
philosophy and hard-nosed legal theory, "isn't 
going to be cited in any Supreme Court opin-
ions." But that's exactly its appeal to the inter-
ested layperson. The ideas are startlingly orig-
inal and the writing style clear, always sensi-
tive to the multilayered meanings of words, 
even lyrical at times. "In the end, it doesn't 
matter what we say to ourselves," he writes in 
the chapter called "Popularity." "We have no 
more choice about the people into which we 
are born than we do about our famj]y or 
body: While we speak, and regardless of what 
we say, a people is writing itself into history, 
the land its palimpsest, and we ourselves its 
characters." 

Reading this book made me "proud to be 
an American" in the way the flag-waving of 
the last two months has nor. This is precisely 
mo·re 
valuable 
to 
Americans than our origins: the tradition of 
free and open inquiry, protected by our laws, 
a tradition we enrich and ennoble by realizing 
it every day of our lives.

**Title: The Girly Freak Show**

EN PM. I could have been watching television, hooking up with 
the hot girl I met the previous night when I accidentally burnt 
a hole through her dress, or simply enjoying the peaceful tran-
quility of a Sunday evening. Instead I was four blocks east of Old 
Campus, down some alley, past a Dunkin Donuts, and inside the Tune 
Inn, where four scantily clad freaks led by art school gross-out band 
GWAR's Slymenstra Hyman were preparing to bare all in The Girly 
Freak Show, a "liaison with the exotic and erotic." I tried to make 
myself at home among the belligerent drunks and the disturbingly 
friendly punks wh,o kept on encouraging me to roll. I stayed sober, 
calm, and eager. I thought anything headlined by "The Pain Proof 
Rubber Girl" had to be good. I was wrong. Billed as "exciting sexy 
shocking entertainment," the show would prove to be about as arous-
ing as the eight questionable winos surrounding me who had showed 
up to gawk at ass. 

When my gaze first met Slymenstra's piercing eyes, I was trans-
fixed, lost in a world in which she was the center and the creepy guy 
next to me didn't exist. She was Sly to her friends, Sly Hy on stage, and 
Hyman on the dotted line. But in my dreams she will always be 
Slymenstra. Sly was an absolute bitch on stage, discharging unprofes-
sionalism by the gallon. In a sheer gol.d lame dress cut just 
below the belly button, matching six-inch heels, and a 
curly pink wig, she was kitschy and egregiously rude. She 
started by attacking innocent audience 
members. At one point she mercilessly 
ridiculed an elderly man in a polka-dot-
ted jacket and "Marine Corpse" hat who 
was giddily hopping up and down with 
a giant picture of Hyman as if he were a 
card girl at a title bout. He begged her 
for a hug, but Hyman refused: "You're 
way too fragile for me, old man." T he 
poor guy was dejected, the crowd was 
disheartened, and I was eager for the 
"Pussy Whipping Cowgirls" to take the···~~ 
stage. 

I refocused my energy. The opening 
act seemed promising. "The Pain Proof 
Rubber Girl," a snobbish chick who fas-
tened flaming knives to her hands and 
danced in circles. She was outlandish yet 
enticing. But her act sucked. The audience 
soon grew tired of her boring dancing, so she varied things a little by 
trampling on pieces of charred glass and eating them. My heart surged. 
I wanted to rush on stage and stop her. I could handle the bad danc-
ing, but I couldn't bear the thought of Rubber Girl's mangled body in 
front of me. T hen, I noticed a four-second delay between her move~ 
ments and the sound of the breaking glass. My concern turned to dis-
illusionment. 

Slymenstra's second act was unsurprisingly weak. Her highly antic-
ipated "pussy whipping" exhibition fell short of my expectations as she 
struggled to get her whip up. She hurled it toward the ceiling, prepar-
ing to punish the Rubber Girl, but kept getting the thing stuck 
between a disco ball and an exposed water pipe. I looked over my 
shoulder to see the unusually quiet crowd's reaction. The inebriated old 
men and pill-popping yo~ngsters were disappointed by her impotence. 
Who wouldn't be? 

Sensing the need to relax and regroup, Hyman asked the audience 
for a cigarette. No one complied. We weren't about to give her nicotine 
until she gave us a decent show. Since she didn't have any cigarettes, 
Hyman ate worms instead. Or at least she pretended to. After closely 
inspecting the slimy creatures, I saw that they were about as real as 
Rubber Girls' 36cs. The polka-dot guy, stiH upset and hug-less, 
noticed this too. He mumbled something and drunkenly 
walked off. I couldn't have agreed more. 

After consuming the worms, Hyman took off her 
top and asked the audience to participate in a moment 
of silence for "Koochie Kamanda," a Freak Show regu-
lar who had injured her throat during a sword swallow-
ing accident. Was I sympathetic? Hardly. Koochie 
had evaded this dreadful night. I would have trad-
ed places with her in a second, wounded esophagus 
and all. I left the Tune Inn ten dollars and one hour of 
my life poorer. But at least I met her. I am thinking of 
blazing flames, taSty worms, cracking whips, the 
refuge of art. This is the only immortality you 
and I may share, my Slymenstra.
