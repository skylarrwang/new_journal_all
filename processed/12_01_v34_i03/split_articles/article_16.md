EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
more Jonathan Lehrer is considering both TPA 
' and a teaching career, he admits discussing 
,the drawbacks of the profession with his par-
ents. "My mother was concerned that it 
might not be intellectually fulfilling," he 
~explained. Sophomore Maricor Santiago's 
parents flatly denied her permission to go 
-•,into teaching. 


Yale students considering TFA seem par-
, ticularly attracted to the idea of using their 
, own privileged educational background to 
"save" low-income children from deficient 
-· schools and bad teachers. At Kopp's Dwight 
Hall appearance, eager Yalies nodded their 
i;,heads in dismay and understanding as she 
'cited statistics describing the plight of inner-
' city public school students. Although Kopp 
stressed that mef!lbers are encouraged to 
r approach their teaching assignments with 
humility, the program's effectiveness is based 
on the theory that its members can do as 
good a job or better than the sites' current 
teachers. 


However, sending thousands of inexperi-
enced young people into the nation's most 
challenged classrooms may not be the best 
solution to these problems, according to 
Gillet. "To see Teach for America as a form of 
social justice is oxymoronic," he explained. 
"How can it be social justice to place uncerti-
fied teachers in needy schools?" He suggested 
instead that experienced, veteran teachers be 
sent to these under-performing schools, since 
they may be better equipped to confront the 
difficult problems facing public schools. 


Teach for America advocates counter 
that as long as teacher shortages exist, the 
need for TFA will remain. A student at Kopp's 
Dwight Hall session questioned whether 
putting first-time teachers into the hardest 
teaching positions simply contributes to the 
existing problems of high teacher turnover 
and poor classroom leadership. 
Kopp 
responded that, at the very least, TFA mem-
bers are better than the substitutes that would 
normally fill teacher vacancies, and that prin-
cipals would rather have "a total superstar 
who stays for two years than an average 
t teacher for six years." She also noted that 6o 
1 percent ofTPA teachers continue in their posi-
tions for a third year. 


Many TFA members, such as Wagner, 
found that their lack of teaching experience 
made their job much more difficult. "It takes 
an amazing, exceptional teacher that has been 
teaching for many years to teach a class of 34 
kids and make sure everyone learns," said 
Wagner. Not only was Wagner's class large, it 
was also filled with what she called the 
school's "bad kids"-the children other 
teachers sought to exclude from theu classes 
because of emotional and behavioral prob-
lems and because they were academically 
behind. Even during her second year of teach-
ing, when her class was more diverse, she esti-
mated that three to four of her students read 
at grade level, one half read below grade level, 
and the rest could not read at all. Although 
she avoided saying that her lack of a teaching 
certificate left her less prepared to deal with 
these challenges, she admitted that she often 
resorted to library books to learn teaching 
techniques, and that she regretted missing out 
on the mentoring relationship developed dur-
ing the teacher certification process, which 
includes classroom observation and work 
under the supervision of a veteran teacher. 


Wagner also found that some of her 
coworkers resented TFA for enabling its mem-
bers to sidestep the teacher certification 
process. "The principal told us not to tell 
other teachers we were Teach for America 
because they'd be hostile that we got jobs over 
people with teaching credentials," she 
remembered. She said this resentment, which 
she only encountered among the least dedi-
cated teachers, was frustrating, but the hostil-
ity seemed to go both ways. "The bureaucra-
cy and quagmiie [new teachers] have to get 
through gives you the kind of person you 
don't want teaching. Smart people don't stand 
in that line waiting," she said. "Teachers don't 
like Teach for America because it deprofes-
sionalizes [them]. Also, it throws college kids 
into areas that have the greatest needs. But, if 
I weren't there, then who would be?" 


In addition to an intensive five-week 
1
training course, TPA encourages members to 
enroll in night or weekend alternative certifi-
cation programs through local schools and 
colleges to increase their effectiveness in the 
classroom. This form of certification has 
become increasingly popular among public 
schools facing shortages in critical areas such 
as math, science, and bilingual education. 
New Haven public schools alone currently 
boast 30 teachers with durational shortage 
area permitS, meaning they can teach for no 
more than two years while in a planned peri-
od of study to receive the appropriate degrees. 
No TFA sites are currently located in 
Connecticut. Although TPA officials said 
many factors ace considered when choosing 
sites, Connecticut's relatively strict teacher-
certification standards make TFA placements 
difficult. 


Wagner seemed irritated that despite her 
two-year stint as a teacher in the Bronx, her 
lack of formal certification prevents her from 
teaching in New Haven. "Despite the fact 
that I'm smarter and have more education 
than 
most people, I 
can't teach in 
Connecticut," she said. 


But less rigorous alternative certification 
programs are unsatisfactory solutions to 
teacher shortage problems, according to Darrel 
Capwell, American Federation of Teachers 
(AFT) spokesman and a classmate of Kopp's at 
Princeton. "Alternative certification is not a 
good substitute for making sure teachers ace 
prepared and certified beforehand," he said. 
"The fact that we ace facing a tremendous 
shortage doesn't mean that it's OK to put peo-
ple who aren't prepared into the classroom." 
Capwell emphasizes that the AFT, the largest 
teachers' union, officially supports TPA. 


Rather than encouraging elite college 
students to enter teaching through TPA, Gillet 
and other critics argue that teacher prepara· 
cion programs should be encouraged as part 
of the curriculum in competitive colleges. 
Currently, six Ivy League schools, including 
Yale, Harvard, and Princeton, boast such pro-
grams. Although the Yale community is large· 
ly receptive to the teacher's preparation pro-
gram, some community members harbor a 
"second-tier" attitude toward teaching. He 
said some professors initially responded to the 
program's creation 
with the attitude, "This is a great program 
because we have some students who really 
aren't going to make it as scientists and really 
should be teachers." 


While at Yale, Wagner attended a panel 
on New Haven public schools featuring 
experts on teaching. She remembered, 
"[Gillet] asked the audience of 50 how many 
wanted to be a teacher and he said none 
[raised their hands] and that's the problem. 
He said, 'You want to understand the prob-
lem intellectually, but you don't want to help 
solve the problem."' 


Although TPA alumni may not remain 
teachers much past their required rwo- or . 
three-year commitment, most stay in the field : 
of education. Wagner explained that one of 
TPAS main strengths is that it attracts students 
to teaching who might not have otherwise 
considered the profession. "If I hadn't done 
TPA I would have ended up studying children 
while I pursed a PHD, as my advisor wanted, 
rather than working with them," she said. 
"You think that you're doing [TPA] for only 
rwo years, but you 
it." 


According to Kopp, 6o percent of all TFA 
alumni are now working in education and 
almost three-fourths of the remaining 40 per-
cent are in some form of work with low 
income f.unilies. Johnston hopes to become a 
principal in his home state of Colorado after 
earning his law degree at Yale. Wagner found-
ed All Our Kin, a local organization that 
trains former welfare recipients to provide 
high quality childcare for their own and oth-
ers' children. Jessica Levin, another Yale grad, 
served in the TFA administration after com-
pleting her teaching commitment and is now 
Chief Knowledge Officer of The New 
Teacher Project, an organization that helps 
school districts and state departments of edu-
cation hire and develop new teachers. Other 
alumni have used their experiences in TPA to 
become "social entrepreneurs" in other relat-
ed fields. 


As long as teacher shortages exist, a need 
for new teachers will remain. Over the next 
ten years, the AFT estimates that we will need 
to recruit, train, hire, and retain rwo million 
teachers. If TPA can recruit 
teachers, then it may be able to play a significant 
role in addressing these problems. The cur-
rent economic crisis may encourage more 
applicants to TFA and teaching positions in 
general. Students are more likely to consider 
teaching as a career when they fear the unsta-
ble job market. According to Capwell, the 
teacher shortage has worsened over the past 
ten years due to the strong economy. 


If the only way to attract Yalies to teach-
ing is by convincing them they are missionar-
ies and not professionals, then TPA does serve 
a purpose. "Yale is not a place that supports 
teaching," Wagner said. "When you tell peo-
ple you want to be a teacher they look down 
on you. They used to ask me what I was going 
to do after I taught [through TFA]. Yale does-
n't value teachers." Although Yale traditional-
ly encourages public service among its stu-
dents and grads, it looks down on the profes-
sion that is arguably most effective at address-
ing disparity and injustice.

**Title: Mr. Perestroika's Manifesto**
**Page number(s): 18**

I believe, as Lenin said, that this revolutionary chaos may yet crystallize into new forms of life. -Mikhail Gorbachev 
'Last fall, a guerrilla emailer targeted three Yale professors. In a near thousand-word 
"'Political Science Manifesto," he condemned "East Coast Brahmins" as "a few men ... who 
cannot for the life-of-me compete with a third grade Economics graduate student" and 
;'baby-stuff models of political science" and demanded the swift overthrow of the political 
. 
,science establishment. "I hope this anonymous letter leads to a dismantling of the Orwellian 
system that we have in APSA [the American Political Science Association) and that we will 
~ee a true Perestroika in the discipline," the note thunderously concluded, alluding to Soviet 
political reforms of the 1980s. The author signed his name simply, "Mr. Perestroika."
