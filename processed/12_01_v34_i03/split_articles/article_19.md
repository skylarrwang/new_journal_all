HE TRAIL CRUSADE BEGAN back 
in 1987, when the nascent FCA 
first learned of the railroad's 
abandonment by its owners two 
weeks before federal proceedings to 
approve the process were complete. 
Until then, the news had only 
appeared in the obscure hderai 
Registtr, and just a few state 
bureaucrats and the mayors of 
the towns affected had been offi-
cially notified. Mayors usually 
pass such lands out to develop-
ers who are political allies with-
out the public ever knowing. 
Through lawsuits and a pub-
licity blitz, however, the FCA 
managed to shame their 
municipal officials into dedi-
cating the lands to a contin-uous, multi-use trail. In a 
1988 Hamden mayoral elec-
tion, the incumbent Ben 
DiNicola, 
who 
had 
promised the canal lands 
to a batch of campaign 
contributors, was defeat-
ed by John Ca.rusone, 
who ran on a pro-trail 
platform. 


Since the acquisi-
tion of federal trans-
portation funds in the 
early 1990s, the cities 
of Hamden and New 
Haven have begun to 
develop their sections 
of the trail, but goals 
have changed over the 
years. The canal no longer leads to the New 
Haven Harbor. It was cut off by street redevelopment in the 1970s.

After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the path was shortened 
again since it was prohibited from passing too near an FBI building 
downtown. If the trail is fully developed as planned, it will end near the 
city center, between the New Haven Green and the Audubon Street 
arts district. It will end there, that is, if the FCA can clear one final obsta-
cle from their path: Yale University. 

After years ofsilence and periods of open hostility to the trail pro-
ject, Yale now claims that it will not allow its section to be a "missing 
link" in the trail. The University preemptively purchased the three 
blocks of the railroad that ran through its campus before city officials 
could get their hands on them. Yale has always reserved the right to 
build on the land that it owns, and plans are underway to build a new 
engineering facility at the corner of Prospect and Trumbull Streets, 
directly adjacent to the canal. The property in question is currently a 
small parking lot upon which Yale's planners envision a soooo-square-
foot building. Despite Yale's professed intentions, canal activists are 
doubtful such a project can be completed. 

Joel Zackin points across the street from where we began our work 
today, to another weedy section of the trail that the city was supposed 
to begin developing this full. Beyond it lies the Yale campus and down-
town New Haven. Zackin emphasizes the importance to the trail of the 
three blocks Yale owns. From where we stand, kids from the Dixwell 
neighborhood could reach the New Haven Free Public Library on their 
bikes and have to cross only one street. Were the trail to end at the Yale 
campus, the kids would be forced onto Prospect Street, and from there 
they would have to run a gauntlet of some of the busiest intersections 
in the city. "We just want to know if there's a tunnel or something 
incorporated into the building design so that the trail can pass through. 
We've already got runnels, and a tunnel is a tunnel. It's okay. It's no big 
deal. What we're saying to the university is, 'Just reassure us, tell us 
how."' But that reassurance is one thing that the university refuses to 
give. 

N A SCRUBBY PIECE OF PROPElrrY near Canal and Lock 
~ 
Streets, alongside the section of the trail Zackin pointed out 
· 
to me from Science Park, there is a hump of concrete and 
rubble covered in rnugwort that stands at least three times as tall as 
Hugh Eastwood, a recent graduate of Yale College who now works for 
Yale's Office of New Haven and State Affairs. "It's kind of hard to view 
from here," says Eastwood, pointing around the hump to an open 


cavity in the 
Dixwell neighborhood, for-
. iner site of the notorious Elm 
Haven housing projects and the 
American Linen Supply Company, 
whose abandoned factory was recendy 
demolished. A small park still remains, 
and some kids who . 
probably liv!e~;====;~~=~~ 
in the pristine new middle-income 
housing development up the road are shoot-
ing hoops. Eastwood goes on with his vision 
ofwhat this neighborhood can become, ges-
turing widely with his hands. "You can kind 
of imagine what we'll do right here. The 
vision is to have a pedestrian center where 
you can walk down a canopy of trees right 
down to Canal and Lock. And you'd have 
houses over here, the new police station up 
there with a community center." He turns to 
the canal. "Here you'd have a bunch of hous-
es facing onto this pathway and houses facing 
onto the park and onto Lock Street." 

Everything in sight would become housing 
that the University would develop and sell. 
Right now, it's all just a pile of junk. 

Climbing over a foothill to the rubble 
mountain is Mike Morand, the University's 
.Associate Vice President for New Haven and 
State Affairs. He describes how the friendly 
front porches facing the trail will guarantee 
the park's safety. "The best way to have safety 
have a lot of people around watching out 
themselves, good lighcing, and good pub-
. . ...... -rv with University and community 
forces," he says. Both he and Eastwood 
that the canal and the surrounding 
though unsighdy, are not unsafe. 
even walk through it, I don't 
• 
think," Eastwood says. "The vegetation is too 
dense. You don't really have people hanging 
out down there." The eyesore will soon be 
gone, Morand promises, as years of revitaliza-
tion planning are brought to fruition. "We've 
been talking about this with the neighbor-
hood for about 20 months now, and there's a 
strong common vision. It's one of those 
things that I think will be a strong win-win-
win situation . . . The place is looking great. 
People are happy with it." On site, this is all 
hard to swallow. The mugwort is as ugly as its 
name suggests. 

Seeking a second professional opinion, I 
talked to David Barone at the City Plan 
Department. After all, the section of the 
canal that Eastwood and Morand were 
the surrounding 
though they cannot 
the dnal development, they 
come it. Barone looks like 
in his workshop: dressed in 
small-checked shirt, short and 
balding, with eyebrows that 
bush up from behind the 
frames of his spectacles. He 
mostly 
agrees 
with 
Eastwood and 
"The canal has been a 
tor-of debris, kind of an un-
cared-for strip of urban land, 
a long time." This section was 
pu r-
the first the city would develop into a hik-
ing trail precisely because of the work 
being done to revitalize the area. "It 
came together so naturally with the 
.Homes at Monterey [the new housing 
in the area) . . . Suddenly that srrip 
became the last piece of public infra-
structure that wasn't developed." 

Moreove{, the two neighborhoods 
beside this stretch of the canal, 
Dixwell and Newhallville, showed a particu-
lar need for such a space. Of all the neighbor-
hoods in New Haven, these two have the 
worst access to recreational facilities. 

As Eastwood, Morand, and I cross 
Prospect Street onro Trumbull Street and 
walk back to their office, they have less to say 
about plans for the University's section of the 
canal, which begins across Prospect Street and 
goes to Whimey Avenue. Morand will not say 
specifically how the trail will be integrated 
into the plans for the new Yale engineering 
center, which will occupy the small lot at 
Prospect and Trumbull. He does maintain, 
however, that somehow the trail will go 
through. "An architectural project has multi-
ple phases to it. lr's an ongoing, iterative 
process," he says. He. directs me to the 
University Planner, but warns that there are as 
yet no fmished plans to share. 

Barone admits that, from his perspective, 
a Yale structure at Prospect Street that 
stopped the trail's progression would be "a 
serious detriment" to the project. "I tbinl 
that the connection through Yale ro down-
town is one of the best features about thi$ 
project," he says. It provides a link bel:w~~!II!II·>Jil
seemingly distant areas. "Suddenly, it's 


Just as Barone looks like a tinker, he 
chinks like an architect, not an activist. He 
has a head for keeping straight the complex 
soliciting, analyses, contracts, processes, and 
reviews a project of this siu requires. If Yale 
says it will let the trail go through, he believes 
it will. Besides, although the Yale section is 
just across the street from the city's current 
project, it is years away in terms of execution. 
He has to build this trail one day, one mile, 
one dollar, at a time. 

m T PROSPECT STREET, where the 
~trail crosses into the campus, there 
is a monument to 
the FCA's perseverance in the 
face of University opposition: 
an expanse of wide open space. 
Were 
it 
not 
for 
Nancy 
Alderman, the space beneath 
the bridge we stand on would 
span nothing but rubble. A grad-
uate of the Yale School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies and che 
President of the FCA, Alderman refers to 
the University as an ominous, imper-
sonal "they." "What they would 
like to see, being big and us 
being small, is co have it stop 
right here," she claims. "That's 
what they've always wanted. 
That's why they wanted co fill 
in these bridges." 

It was Alderman who led 
the vanguard of a public rela-
tions blit2 to stop Yale from 
walling off the sections of the 
canal it owns beneath the 
bridges at Prospect Street, 
Temple Street, and Whitney 
Avenue, and filling the spaces 
with construction debris. Yale 
asked 
the 
Connecticut 
Department 
of 
Transportation to abandon a 
plan to install culverts, a rype 
of supporting pier, beneath 
the bridges. This would have 
allowed 
cyclists 
and 
rollerbladers to pass through 
on a future trail. Instead, Yale 
wanted the spaces beneath the 
bridges filled and blocked 
from pedestrians. And they 
asked the state not to hold a 
public hearing on the issue, Alderman says, 
which is required by law since state funds 
were being used for the project. 

Yale viewed the canal as ~ line of "very 
deep, narrow trenches which are not safe for 
joggers or bikers," and said it supported a trail 
path through campus, just not through the 
canal. This notion was anathema to trail 
activists, who are attracted to the Yale section 
precisely because of its topography: It is the 
last canal section in the city chat hasn't been 
filled in, and the only one that preserves the 
original architecture. And of course there is 
the larger goal of building an uninterrupted 
trail into downtown. Letters 
co the editor were 
penned; voices were 
raised. Eventually, 
Yale backed down. 
Now, 
rather 
chan concrete fill, 
the University may 
block the way with an 
entire building. The FCA 
has suffered this battle in 
uncharacteristic silence 
mostly because their 
hopes do not lie with 
the University. As ic 
happened, Yale chose 
Cesar Pelli & Associates to 
design the new building. 
Pelli, one of the most 
respected architects alive, is 
also a longtime supporter of 
the canal project. "We have a 
better chance with Cesar Pelli 
chan with any ocher person on 
earth," ~derman says. The Joe 
has enough room to park 20 
automobiles; it is Pelli's task co 
fit 50000 square feet of new 
building into the same 
• roughly 
triangular 
space. "I don't think 
that the Universiry 
doesn't like this trail. 
T he 
question 
is 
going to be how 
much they do like it," 
Alderman says. "We're 
asking that they love it 
so much that they'll 
do 
anything 
to 
accommodate it . .. I 
am caking the tack that they will do it if they 
can do it." Looking again ac the lot, she adds, 
"But Cesar Pelli is going co have to be smarter 
than God co figure out how it can be done." 

HOUSANOS OF PEOPLE EVERY DAY 
- ~ trample over the most valuable 
. antiques in New Haven without 
ever knowing ic. Nor do they notice when 
these architectural treasures are hacked co 
pieces by their elected officials, the remains 
discarded as worthless. At lease that's how Bill 
Brown sees it. Brown, director of the Eli 
Whitney Historical Museum in Hamden and 
a long-time member of the FCA, is passionate 
about canals, their architecture, and their 
symbolism. While we take a scroll down the 
Yale-owned portion of the canal, the portion 
of the canal the FCA is longing to save, Bill 
shows off the original 1825 bridge abutments. 

We make our way through the brush 
chat crowds the path, occasionally tripping on 
the bottles and refuse strewn about the home-
less camps chat spring up from time to time 
under the bridges. Homeless people should 
not be an issue once the trail is developed, he 
says in an aside. "When you gee lighting and 
a critical mass of people, the homeless guys 
have to find someplace else. It's never some-
thing we should be comfortable with, chat 
some can't or don't want co use the shelters. 
But it's a problem to be solved. It doesn't 
diminish the canal." 

It is always easy co disregard the history 
of the canal in questions of development, Bill 
explains. The city has done just that in previ-
ous projects when original canal archiceccure 
was destroyed and replaced. "Some people 
view history as a nuisance and something 
they'd rather not have co deal with," he says. 
"For me, chat would be regretful here. Is all 
chis important? Well, it's an irreversible com-
promise. If you let this go down, ic can never 
be rescored. Even if you cannot correct every-
thing that's here at the moment, future plan-
ners will wonder if this connection was here 
and was squandered." Bill explains chat canals 
are all about the need for connections. 

"Canals were the first public utility in 
America," he says. "This was the first 
moment when we discovered chat we've got 
co make connections between communities. 
This canal is an appropriate symbol of where 
we are today."
