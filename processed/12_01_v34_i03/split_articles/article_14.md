ONE AFTERNOON, DANNY SIEGEL (AKA "The 
Feeling Person's Thinker," AKA "The Pied 
Piper ofTzedakah," AKA "The Most Famous 
Unknown Jewish Poet in America") led Yale 
in its first ever "Mitzvah Walk." It was unusu-
ally warm for October, and Danny met our 
small group of six Yale students outside of the 
Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale 
wearing a baseball cap, tinted bifocals, a worn 
shirt, khaki shorts, and sneakers. Tucked 
under his right arm were several pam-
phlets and a glossy paperback copy of 
his latest book I + I = 3 and 37 Other 
Mitzvah Principks to Live By. (Mitzvah 
is the Hebrew word for commandment 
used by Siegel and many others to mean 
"good deed.") "What we're trying to find 
out," he explained, "is how local businesses 
could be useful co the people of the commu-
nity. For instance, if a restaurant throws out 
all its leftover food at the end of the day, we 
need co find a way to get that food to people 
who need it. Basically, we're looking for peo-
ple with certain 'expercises,' but not the kind 
of 'expertises' you'd think would be immedi-
ately useful. oK?" A round of head nods, a few 
uncertain smiles, and then Danny was off. 
walking slowly but talking a mile a minute 

Both groups demanded to be 
recog n .• zed 


and in no coherent fashion-first it was mitv 
vahs, then New Haven, then his non-profit 
Ziv Tzedakah Fund, which somehow led to 
therapeutic horseback riding in Israel, which· 
segued into the various charitable uses for 
hotel shampoo, followed by a long digression 
on the Lion's Club, used eyeglasses, and refer-
ences to his poetry, and eventually returned to 
our New Haven "Mitzvah Walk." And all this 
before we got to the fiiSt stop. 

In his off-the-wall way, Danny Siegel has 
spent nearly 30 years trying tO get people to 
subscribe to a simple philosophy: "Whatever 
I want for myself, I want for other people." 
Since 1981 he has distributed over $4.5 million 
through the Ziv Tzedakah Fund, an organiza-
tion that, according to its literature, claims to 
"receive contributions which [it] gives to 
inspiring individuals and programs," so that 
good people can carry on good deeds, or 
mitzvahs, through the generosiry of others. 

Most of Danny's 25-plus books promote 
tzedakah, the Hebrew word for "righteous-
ness," which they translate as "doing the right 
thing," and the work of "Mitzvah heroes"-
people who, as he puts it, go out of their way 
"to fix the world." But he insists, "I don't 
fundraise. I'm not a fundraiser. I speak, and 
people send money. That's all." In fact Danny 
earns his living entirely though the sale of his 
books, which include several volumes of poet-
ry (more than a few out of print), and 
through speaking engagements at syna-
gogues, colleges, and various conferences. For 
$1500 Slifka got a Mitzvah Walk, a working 
dinner, and a formal talk, all of which were 
intended, as Danny put it, "to raise awareness 
about doing good and becoming good peo-
ple." 

Bur watching Danny Siegel take on the 
New Haven business communiry, one might 
wonder how he became such a sought-after 
lecturer. At our first stop, a local dry cleaners, 
the manager had been forewarned about 
Danny's visit, but still seemed flustered by his 
rapid-fire questions: "What do you do with 
clothes left for more than three months? 
What do you do with clothes you think no 
one will claim?" He drew closer to the already 
befuddled manager. "Is there a place where 
you could donate them?" he pressed. "Do you 
ever do alterations for free? Do you ever do 
cleanings for free for people who can't afford 
them?" As Danny explained later, this kind of 
approach is fairly typical. "It's a kind of free 
association," he said. "I am incapable of 
thinking linearly. So I can't give you a system-
atic explanation, only a free-associative one." 

Apparently the manager was a linear thinker. 
After a thoughtful pause, he replied that the 
cleaners usually returned clothes to their 
owners and that although people would 
sometimes leave their garments for extended 
·periods of time, they almost invariably 
claimed rhein. I could tell this was not exact-
ly the answer .Danny was hoping for, but he 
still seemed optimistic and urged us on to our 
next business, a nearby coffee shop. 

But upon reaching the cafe, D anny 
seemed suddenly fatigued and ducked out for 
a few minutes to "clear his head," giving at 
least one of my fellow walkers a chance to 
speak freely. Micah Lapidus, the current 
Jewish Campus Service Corps (Jcsc) Fellow 
at Slifka, tried to explain his reasons for 
bringing Danny to Yale. Micah first heard 
Danny speak less than a year ago, while still a 
senior at Stanford, and asked him that very 
day to come speak at Yale the following year. 
"My motivation," he explained, as we waited 
for coffee on Slifka's tab, "was to let other 
people hear what he has to say. H e sees things 
in ways the rest of us would never think 
about." Micah paused for a moment, the 
expression on his face one of undisguised 
admiration and enthusiasm. "I don't know," 
he concluded. "His message is simple, but 
that doesn't diminish it in any way. H e's real-
ly a true paradigm." 

Unfortunately, Danny's zeal for good 
works did not prove universally infectious. 
Despite a friendly reception at the coffee 
shop, we received no guarantees about possi-
ble donations to local shelters, and after less 
than five minutes at a New Haven copy store, 
Danny seemed to deduce that discount copies 
for charity would not be forthcoming, at least 
not from the unsmiling gentlemen behind 
the counter. The cosmetics store around the 
corner proved no more hopeful. When 
D anny asked a young saleswoman about free 
manicures for battered women, she only 
looked up from her inventory long enough to 
inform us, "Nail polish isn't environmentally 
safe." Then again, it was probably obvious 
that Danny wasn't going "to hang around for a 
makeover. 

After only four businesses in just under 
two hours, we left the cosmetics store with 
about half our original walkers (the others 
lost to "class" or "section"), and Danny told 
us he needed a nap. Still, he remained confi-
dent about the "Mitzvah Walk." He turned to 
the remaining walkers and urged us to go 
back and follow up on his work. A couple 
nodded noncommittally, but at least one 
looked as though he had found his hero. 
"People ask me why the stuff we do is impor-
tant when terrorists are flying planes into the 
World Trade Center," Danny told us. "But it 
is important. It's about human dignity. Every 
time I pass these pamphlets on to a new per-
son, every time someone cuts their hair for a 
cancer victim, every time som eone drives left-
over food to a shelter, it makes a difference." 

A few minutes later a heavyset woman carry-
ing a shopping bag filled with paper-wrapped 
flowers approached Danny. "Would you like 
to buy a flower so I can stay at the shelter 
tonight?" she asked. Danny jumped at the 
opportunity. "I'd love to," he replied. He 
bought five.
