ONLY 1WO TYPES OF FANS come tO a jai-alai 
match anymore: compulsive gamblers and 
the chronically bored. Sometimes they are 
both: young, sweaty men who scratch lottery 
tickets in between matches; ancient, transpar-
ent-skinned couples who clutch three-dollar 
bets and pass whole minutes staring above the 
action with unresponsive eyes. These miser-
able specimens-
and few of them-are what 
I found at the self-proclaimed International 
Championships of]ai-Alai on the weekend of 
November 2-4, in Milford, CT. But it hardly 
matters. The Milford Jai-Alai Fronron is the 
last professional venue for this sport in 
Connecticut, and it is closing in December. 

The immediate cause for the Fronron's 
demise is that the tribal casinos Foxwoods 
and Mohegan Sun have taken away its busi-
ness. It might have been able to keep afloat, 
but Sports Haven, the off-track betting estab-
lishment by the New Haven Harbor, has 
refused to share its franchise. So at the 
Fronton long seams of grass crack through 
the empty parking lots, only three of the 50 
betting windows remain open, and you can 
get a beer or a cheeseburger for 99 cents on 
Thursdays. The glory days of Milford Jai-
Alai, back before they closed the lounge, 
when high-rollers tipped valets and thousands 
packed the place, are long past. As soon as the 
casinos opened, the crowds and the money 
left, not only because Milford Jai-Alai is a sin-
gularly unpleasant place; but also because the 
jai-alai played there is an awfully depressing 
game. 

Jai-alai resembles a racquet sport, 
although players catch and throw the ball 
with scoop-shaped baskets strapped to thei~ 
wrist. Once I realized this, and once I stopped 
listening to the butchered Basque affectations 
of the announcer, the game became easy to 
follow. Its dynamic and rules are more or less 
those of squash. What really makes jai-alai 
different is not that players propel the ball 
with sestas, or that they call their ball a pe/ota, 
but that the court is 140 feet long, and the 
ball can travel over 150 miles per hour. 

My program cheerily explained the ori-
gins of jai-alai as a version of handball played 
against the sides of Basque cathedrals. In its 
primal form, played by local rules, it demand-
ed almost superhuman agility, endurance, 
and strategy. In America, jai-alai was intro-
duced as a new diversion for fin de si~c/e 
crowds just becoming familiar with sluggish 
domestic sports and their beefy players: foot-
ball, baseball, boxing. The 1904 World's Fair 
in St. Louis packed a 6ooo-seat stadium with 
an audience that had never imagined lithe, 
olive-skinned young men or the gymnastic 
potential of professional athletes. Throughout 
the 1930s, jai-alai was a major draw for 
Florida's emerging tourist industry. But its 
true glory days were in pre-Castro Havana-
the capital city of exotic pleasure. 

Betting on jai-alai first became legal in 
those Florida frontons. Gambling did more 
than change the spectator's relationship with 
the sport, it changed the game itself. Like ten-
nis or squash, jai-alai does not naturally make 
a good betting game. This is because the 
matches are long, two sides compete, and you 
either win or lose your bet. Bookies make 
team sports more interesting by giving gam-
blers the chance to call point spreads or wager 
on the performance of one player, but jai-alai 
is played to a point limit, with only two play-
ers-four when playing doubles. American 
ingenuity found a way to ftx jai-alai with the 
"Spectacular Seven" scoring system, which 
pits eight players against each other in a 
round robin. Player one serves to player two. 
Whoever wins serves to player three. After all 
eight have played a point, the scoring dou-
bles. Games are played to seven. 

Anyone who has watched or played ten- . 
nis or squash knows that while a long rally is 
exciting, racquet sports are more about 
endurance and strategy than agility and 
power. A 15-second tennis spot on the eleven 
o'clock news is not interesting at all; a 45-
minute set can be riveting. The same is true 
with jai-alai, but "Spectacular Seven" ~cans 
that a match is made up of 30 or 40 fragments 
without the narrative of a continuous game to 
expose the players' strategy or to prove their 
athleticism. This mode of play makes it pos-
sible to bet in an astonishing number of ways, 
fits r6 games into an afternoon or evening, 
Â·and it used to make real money for fronton 
owners-Milford dragged in $87 million in 
1988. But it also means that professional jai-
alai is phenomenally un-fun to watch. 

Jai-alai players are no more enthusiastic 
than the crowd. One or two points is not long 
enough to get into one's groove, so almost 
every player leaves the court kicking she wall 
and scowling. The new shape of the sport has 
also taken the need for endurance out of the 
game, and made power more important-
serving aces is the way to win in "Spectacular 
Seven." This has reshaped the players in turn: 
Now they are sluggish and stocky, as unen-
thusiastic in their physiognomy as in their 
performance. A couple of them rallied for the 
big tournament, which pitched them against 
players from Spain and Florida for $2o,ooo in 
prizes-not chump change for someone who 
pulls in 40 or 50K a year, and who will be 
unemployed come December. But their .best 
moments wt;re only mediocre, and the place 
seemed only a little less drab when a Milford 
player named Wayne won me 16 bucks. 

Acrually, some of the doubles games 
-were pretty good. But if the international 
roster of players assembled for the tour-
nament was any indication of the 
strength of the field, then there is not a 
man alive today who plays the whole 
court well. The New Haven Register 
reports that some players are moving to 
Florida or Rhode Island to keep playing; 
some of them will probably return home 
to Basque Spain. But my visits to Milford 
have proven to my satisfaction that jai-
alai has been a dead sport for decades, 
and that it is now a dying industry as 
well. The whole appeal of the game rests 
in a relationship between the audience 
and the spectacle which has been made 
irrelevant and impossible by our media 
culture and our shortening attention 
spans, even without "Spectacular Seven" 
thrown in the mix. Foxwoods may be a 
grim place itself, but at least there you can 
breathe the oxygen of real money, and of 
real human drama. An old widower hitting 
the jackpot on quarter slots or a young fami-
ly man cashing personal checks for more 
chips-this is entertainment with some blood 
in it.
