EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Today, however, the trail remains overgrown and unsightly. Bill Brown is just happy 
that it's not gone. We pass under one particularly long tunnel, the length of a city block, 
that the University wanted to fill in 1996. It is 
dark even in the midday sun. "Rather than 
find this oppressive or frightening, I find it 
exciting," Bill says, beaming. At length, we 
emerge on the other side of Whitney Avenue, 
climb up the canal's ten-foot walls, and find 
ourselves among students from the Creative 
Arts Workshop and the Neighborhood Music 
School. We've successfully navigated from the 
Dixwell neighborhood to the Arts Center, but 
we're a filthy and disturbing sight to the elementary schoolers: Bill, a hefty six-feet-two 
with a pirate-like eye-patch, bends over panting, lamenting his lost youth. I brush the dirt 
from my jeans and notice my hands are 
scraped and bleeding. 

Recent developments indicate that the 
passage from Dixwell, let alone from 
Northampton, won't be getting easier anytime soon. A few days after my journey with 
Bill, the City of New Haven announced that, 
since no contractor could be found for its low 
bid, plans for the canal were being reconsidered to find ways of bringing down costs. The 
groundbreaking ceremony was postponed 
indefinitely, though David Barone said that 
they hope to begin work sometime in the 
spring. When I contacted Pam Delphenich, 
the university planner, she could not tell me 
how exactly Yale's new engineering complex 
will accommodate the trail, and Cesar Pelli & 
Associates, who instructed me to clear all 
questions through a Yale representative, could 
not be reached for comment. Delphenich 
repeated, however, that the trail will somehow 
go through.


AT LEAST ONE MAN will be happy if none of 
these thorny, bureaucratic obstacles 
is ever removed and the canal 
stays how it is: overgrown, impassable, and virtually deserted. His 
name is Pete*, and I find him at Harmony 
Place, a community center for the homeless 
in New Haven housed in a Lutheran church 
on downtown Orange Street, two blocks 
from where the Farmington Canal trail will 
blend into city streets and extend to the 
waterfront, should its development ever pass 
through the Yale campus and down this far. 

Pete and some friends live beneath a 
bridge in a shantytown that I've noticed 
before. It's a spot that might not look out of 
place on the outskirts of Caracas or Peshawar. 
A tent stands amid strewn boxes, newspapers, 
food wrappers, bottles, cans, and stray articles 
of clothing. No trees grow beneath the 
bridge, due to the heavy shade, so it is a rare 
spot where the weeds are not overgrown and 
blocking the way. The pungent smell of urine 
fills the air. 

Born in Detroit, Pete has lived in New 
Haven for 37 years, year-round in the canal 
for the past three. He has one or two friends 
who live there as well, though others occasionally join them. "They kick you out of 
those shelters at the drop of a hat," he 
explains. "You blink and they'll kick you 
out." Pete will usually take such cases in, but 
only if he knows that they won't make trouble. That way, the group gets no trouble in 
return. 

Their place is nice, Pete says—shady in 
summer and without a wind-chill in winter. 
And they're seldom bothered—occasionally 
by the police, but more often by drunken bar 
patrons. "They come down there to get laid," 
he says. "And we see 'em—just the shadows 
really, bouncing up and down on the walls." 
As for the animals, Pete explains, "We don't 
bother 'em." They see an opossum, a raccoon, 
and even occasionally a skunk, who is not 
welcome but is never chased away. "We did 
have an old owl down there too," he tells me. 
"We'd be ass-ing all night, and he wouldn't 
give a shit. He'd be sitting up there, and every 
now and again he'd glide through, and you'd 
just hear a squeak. He was there last year, but 
he ate all the rats and then left." 

Pete himself has no plans for moving 
anytime soon; he is unfazed by the news that 
development on the canal may soon begin. 
He's heard it all before, he claims, and puts no 
stock in it. He even attended an FCA meeting 
once, and left unimpressed. If it's Yale property he lives on, it'll be at least ten years, he 
reckons, before he'll have to move. He doesn't 
have much faith in the bureaucratic process. 
If he does have to move, however, he won't 
mind too much, so long as it's for a purpose. 
"But we don't want to move," he adds, "if 
they ain't never gonna finish it."
