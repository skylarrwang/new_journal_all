OBITUARIES AND FOOTBALL SCORES graced its 
pages in the 18oos, and during the 1960s pho-
tographs of nude women appeared on its 
cover. And at the height of the Yak Literary 
Magazinls most unexpected incarnation in 
the late 1970s, Russian themes and ideas per-
meated the publication. During this era, the 
magazine, established in 1836 and bearing dis-
tinction as both the oldest existing publica-
tion at Yale and the oldest literary review in 
North America, almost lost its very name. 

Most students part with their extracur-
ricular activities when they graduate, but this 
was not the case for one former editor of the 
Lit, Andrei Navrowv. After graduating in 
1978, he began to publish a magazine to 
which be gave the inventive tide the Yak 
Literary Magazine. The new magazine, staffed 
by Navrozov and his compatriots, had a dis-
tinctly Russian focus, including Navrozov's 
own translations of poems by two Russian 
Nobel laureates, Joseph Brodsky and Boris 
Pasternak. Though Navrozov and the maga-
zine remained in New Haven, Navrozov no 
longer had any official affiliation with the 
University, and the publication was produced 
entirely outside of Yale. The Yak Litmzry 
Magazine was no longer a Yale organization. 

Navrozov's "Yale Lit" managed to incur a 
$7o,ooo debt by 1980. He desperately 
searched for support and lit upon the 
American Literary Sociery in 1981. With the 
underwriting of the conservative organiza-
tion, the circulation of the magazine rose to 
uooo and it gained an international reader-
ship. In 1982, the editorial board of 
THE NEW JoURNAL 

Navrozov's magazine claimed "the Yak 
Literary Magazine is in its Golden Age." 

Indeed, the magazine enticed contributors 
such as Ezra Pound and William F. Buckley, · 
Jr., though it was Buckley himself who noted 
in an article published in Navrowv's maga-
zine that "the Yak Literary Magazine has wan-
dered as far away from the direct concerns of 
Yale University as Yale University has wan-
dered 
from 
the 
concerns 
of 
Congregationalist Church." 

Buckley was not the only one to notice 
the separation of the Yak Literary Magazine 
from Yale University. Yale rewrote its 
Undergraduate Regulations in 1982 to explic-
itly state for the first time that all University 
organizations using Yale's name had to be reg-
istered and controlled by currently enrolled 
undergraduate students. 

· 
Navrowv then took his most drastic 
step. He and the American Literary Society 
sued Yale for creating the new policy, claim-
ing that the University had acted illegally and 
fraudulently by revising the regulations. The 
American Literary Society complained that 
the "rule-change had been brought about by 
a handful of jealous professors," according to 
the New Havm journal Courier. 

Defeated by the Connecticut Superior 
Court, Navrozov and the American Literary 
Society appealed, alleging that the revised 
rule violated anti-trust laws. "We're bloody, 
but unbowed at this point," said their lawyer. 

Vehemently claiming that he had bought 
the rights to the name of the Yak Literary 
Magazine for $1.00 from the undergraduate 
organization that 
once controlled 
it, 
Navtozov argued that he deserved complete 
control over the name. And meanwhile, the 
American Literary Society filed an applica-
tion with the us Patent and Trademark Office 
to register the trademark "Yale Literary 
Magazine." The application was denied. 

"Their claim of sham litigation is wholly 
unsubstantiated by anything in the record," 
stated the fed-up federal judge in 1987, afrer
