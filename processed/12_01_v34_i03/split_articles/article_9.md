To ARGUE WITH KATHLEEN CLEAvER is to 
realize your ignorance. She knows more than 
you. She will interrupt you, contradict you, 
and leave you tongue-tied. She will overwhelm you with her fiery eloquence. 

At 58, she has abandoned the Afro, 
leather boots, and miniskirts that she favored 
in her days as a Black Panther in the late 
196os, but she is still strikingly beautiful. Her 
hair falls in skinny braids; chunky silver 
bracelets clink up and down her wrists. Her 
confidence is palpable. She carries around 
books by her friends Noam Chomsky and 
Evelyn Williams, quoting them freely and 
often. She speaks clearly, in deep, warm tones, 
with precise t's and flickering l's. 

Cleaver has had time to perfect her 
speaking skills, having devoted her entire life 
to activism. She is best known as a leader of 
the Black Panther Party, a militant black 
power group that had its heyday in the 196os 
and 1970s. In an interview with The New 
journal in 1981, Cleaver described the 
Panthers' attitude at the height of the movement: "When people reach the point that 
they won't respect you, they won't give you 
what you want, and they won't be reasonable, 
then just shoot them. Then, you can talk to 
them. If you make it clear that you're not 
going to be pushed around any more, that 
anyone who tries will be shot, it changes the 
dialogue a lot." Initially, Cleaver was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee, a civil rights group, but she grew 
frustrated with the slow pace of the nonviolence movement and joined the Panthers. 
There she met her future husband Eldridge 
Cleaver, the Panthers' Minister of 
Information. After Eldridge was charged with 
assault and attempted murder by the 
Oakland, CA, police, she fled with him to 
Algeria in 1969. 

She returned to the United States in 1975 
with two children in tow, and continued to 
work as a civil rights activist during the '7os. 
In 1981, she enrolled at Yale, earning her bachelor's degree in 1984 and her JD from the Law 
School in 1989. She currently teaches at 
Emory Law School. 

Cleaver's extraordinary credentials and 
reputation for radical opinions brought her 
back to Yale for the 2001 Black Solidarity 
Conference. I listened to her keynote speech 
that Saturday, and I was blown away. Hardly 
stopping to take a sip of water, she called on 
students to reject the propaganda that white 
American institutions spout, to stay connected to each other and to black communities, 
and to remember the millions of historical 
atrocities committed against black people in 
the United States. She spoke forcefully and 
confidently, with a calm insistence that the 
audience take her seriously. Her words were 
not exactly hostile, but two or three times, I 
averted my eyes as one of the few white people in the room. 

An hour later, I was sitting in a sun-
drenched room in Linsly-Chinenden Hall, 
fumbling with my tape recorder and not sure 
what to expect from Cleaver. But Cleaver has 
an uncanny ability to adapt her message to 
her audience. As soon as she came into the 
room, her manner was friendly, and she 
immediately had me talking about my reactions to her speech. 

Not quite demanding, not quite emo-
tional, not quite urgent, her voice has been 
seasoned with 30 years of experience. At a 
time when most peoples' parents were settling 
into jobs and shrouding themselves in the 
idyllic comfort of the suburbs, she was going 
back to school to further arm herself with 
knowledge. She watched this country 
descend into what she sees as solidly 
entrenched conservatism; she watched as the 
Black Panther Party, its members blacklisted, 
disintegrated, leaving political prisoners from 
the '6os still behind bars. She has seen draft 
dodgers grow old and conservative, and she 
has seen a major shift in the mindset of their 
children. "During the '6os young people were 
more under the influence of the values of 
their parents, their Sunday school, their 
Hebrew school," she told me. "They were 
shocked, absolutely shocked, by the assassination of the president, they were appalled by 
the violence and genocidal destructiveness of 
the Vietnam War. There was a sense that the 
violence against civil rights workers was horrendous. I think the recognition that you 
know what's right, that the government's 
doing what's wrong--that's all gone. Your 
generation is much more cynical and says, 
'Oh, he's a crook. Oh, he's a hypocrite. So 
what else is new?' And there's this acceptance 
of this degenerate behavior on the part of the 
government." 

But despite her frustration that America 
is wallowing in political stagnation, she does 
not seem tired. At one point in our conversation she hinted slightly at burnout, but clearly, she has not given up or joined the 
Establishment. "What I do is try to gain the 
attention of people who will be operating 
within the system to make them understand 
certain legal processes that have this extraordinary degree of tyranny, to understand how 
the system can be abused. If you 
recognize that, you can act to challenge it--not to go in all starry-
eyed and think the law is for the 
people, 'cause it's not. The legal system 
operates on behalf of the established 
order to protect the material 
wealth of those who are in charge 
of the established order. If you are 
willing to go up against that, you 
spend an enormous amount of 
time and resources and effort 
defending the people who challenge the laws, and you need a 
whole lot more troops to do this." 

She addressed the issue of 
well-intentioned white liberals who 
aren't sure what to do to improve 
race relations on a campus like 
Yale's. "It's not black people who 
are racist--black people are the targets of racism. So there's been a 
whole movement built up to 
defend and to resist racism. People who disagree with racism who are white tend to look 
to the recipients of the racism as a source of 
how to deal with it instead of looking to the 
source of the racism, which is in the leadership of white communities. Do the black people have to do all the work?" 

She called on college students to break 
out of their current complacency. "To me, 
that's what a person in a highly intellectual 
environment is supposed to do: ask questions, 
not just accept what you're told at face value. 
That's what you're told in your classrooms, 
right? So are you supposed to ask questions 
only of the material in the classroom? You 
can't ask questions of the material in the New 
York Times. I mean, come on." 


She had spoken about the evils of globalization, the capitalistic domination of the 
American government, and the lack of access 
to non-corporate media, but I still had questions about her history. She flatly denied the 
most common criticism of the Panthers, that 
"'The Black Panther Party advocated division.' No. The Black Panther Party is recognizing the causes of this division and advocating a means to work across it. That's a radical 
departure. The media and the government 
benefit from the division. So they see these 
Black Panthers and the anti-war protesters 
working together, and they say, 'Let's figure 
out how we can stop it.'" 

I felt myself being sucked in by her 
rhetoric, but as I walked out of the interview, 
my initial burst of admiration gave way to my 
old cynical reflex. Looking back on our conversation, I knew that plenty of analytical, 
arrogant Yalies would probably scoff at 
Cleaver's calls to action. Maybe my caution-
ary voice is right, and her ideas are irrational 
and far-fetched. But I'm inclined to think her 
viewpoint is all the more important now. 
Cleaver has devoted 30-odd years to fighting 
for what she believes in, and she has adapted 
her strategy to a completely different era. 
Though the rest of the world might have 
given up, Cleaver's revolution continues.

THIS IS YOUR BRAIN. This is your brain on 
computers. In roughly 30 years, give or take, 
our brains will be uploaded onto computers, 
professor Nick Bostrom imagines. "You'll 
wake up and find yourself living in a virtual 
reality." 

From his cloistered office above the computer lab in Connecticut Hall, 28-year-old 
Bostrom is helping to speed up human evolution. Bostrom, a lecturer in the Yale philosophy department, is the co-founder of the 
World Transhumanist Association (WTA). 
Transhumanism, a term coined by Aldous 
Huxley, describes the further evolution of 
humanity through educational and psychological means. However, around 15 years ago, 
a disparate group of people who were interested in the use of all kinds of technologies to 
"evolve" human life--from cryonics and 
space travel to drugs--co-opted the term. 

Since childhood, Bostrom has believed that 
sooner or later we would learn how to 
enhance human intelligence and develop 
machines that would be smarter than 
humans. Around five years ago, he learned 
there were others with the same ideas. 

Founded in 1998, the WTA attempts to 
bring together this varied group of people, to 
advance the acceptance of Transhumanism as 
an academic field, and to foster greater public 
awareness and networking about 
Transhumanist concepts. Bostrom is determined to lead this movement out of the ivory 
tower; he proudly claims that over 1600 people have joined, from truck drivers to film 
producers to academics and engineers. 

In addition to producing journals 
and 
websites 
promulgating 
Transhumanism, the WTA holds annual conferences to discuss developments. Last year's 
conference in London included lectures on 
topics such as "The Hedonistic Imperative" 
and "My Life as a Cyborg." 

According to Bostrom, the basic tenet is 
that "we can and should use technology to 
overcome some of the fundamental limitations of human nature." To Bostrom, the 
concept of a static human "nature" is passé. 
Transhumanists would enhance our intellectual abilities, abolish the aging process, and 
improve our emotional experiences through 
such technologies as artificial intelligence, 
molecular nanotechnology, and "uploading." 
Uploading would entail creating a 3-D molecular map of the brain and then transferring 
this brain architecture onto a computer--a 
"source code of your mind." "Information 
processing can be done on silicon as well as
