HE DEPARTMENT OF SociAL SERVICES (oss) on Basset Street is a 
quiet place on a Friday afternoon. Agents behind a glass partition 
call up patrons from the rows of plum-colored plastic chairs that fill the 
large, 
dimly-lit

Individuals and parents with children trickle in and out, taking care of 
errands before the weekend. Today,, 
people quickly get what they came for, 
but on a busier day the line can take 
hours. 

A youngish mother, lips lined 
with black pencil, lightened hair 
pulled into a high ponytail, waits for 
her name to be called while her twin 
daughters play. I cautiously approach 
her, hoping to learn what welfare 
reform feels like from the inside. 

While she declines to tell me her 
name, she readily shares her story of 13 years in the system. Shortly after 
graduating from Wilbur Cross High School, she gave birth to her first 
child, now nine years old. When things got rocky with the child's 
father, there was only one place to go-back to her mother. Together 
the three wandered from apartment to apartment, relying on welfare 
cash assistance for survival. Finally, the woman landed a job at the Fair 
Haven Super K.mart, but was soon pregnant with twins and out of 
work again. "Now, for me to get work, it's a lot harder because [the 
twins] take up a lot of my time," she explains. "It's hard to get day-
care." Not long ago, she reentered the workforce, this time as a bus 
aide. But even with an income, welfare pays the bills. "I'm paying 
$600 rent. That leaves me 39 dollars left to my name as far as cash goes. 
So I'm basically struggling." In 16 months, her welfare payments will 
stop forever. 

Welfare reform has arrived in New Haven. On October 1, 112 New 
Haven families hit their lifetime limit for state cash assistance; they can 
no longer receive any welfare money. Another 39 were dropped from 
the welfare rolls on November 1, and on the first of every month from 
now on, dozens of families will lose cash benefits, often their only 
source of income. The oss estimates that before 
the end of the year, 1000 Connecticut children 
will be affected by welfare reform. Another 690 
families will enter their final extension in the 
same period.

With the economic bubble of the nineties 
already a memory and unemployment on the 
rise, nearly all Americans are preparing for lean-
er times, but for those exiting welfare, the 
future looks especially uncertain. Last August, 
New Haven community organizations-home-
less shelters, food banks, and advocacy 
groups-met for the first time to discuss the 
impending exodus of welfare recipients. The 
state had set the date of termination five years 
before, but hadn't taken the initiative to plan for hundreds of destitute 
families. Now, shelters are full, funds are limited, resources are 
strapped, and no one knows where the families will go. 


D
URING THE 1992 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, Bill Clinton famous-
ly vowed "to end welfare as we know it." Connecticut beat 
Clinton and Congress to the punch, instituting a statewide wel-
fare-to-work program over a year before national reform. By January 
1996, Republican Governor John Rowland had reduced cash payments 
and instituted a time-limited benefit program. Eight months later, 
President Clinton signed the "Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act" into law. Commonly known as "wel-
fare reform," the act ended the Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children program, replacing it with federal block grants for state-
administered welfare-to-work programs. These block grants came with 
a stipulation: a five-year limit on welfare payments. 


"There's a general feeling that if we just 
give families a kick in the pants they'll get it 
together," says Cheri Quickmire, a New 
Haven organizer for Christian Community 
Action. "Connecticut's convoluted welfare 
laws-some of the strictest in the country-
reflect 
that kick-in-the-pants attitude. 

Families face an initial cutoff period of 21 
months for cash benefits under Jobs First, the 
current welfare-to-work program. (If a recip-
ient gets cash assistance for a single day of a 
calendar month, that month counts toward 
the limit.) Those who attend the mandatory 
job training and make good-faith efforts to 
find work may apply for six-month exten-
sions. Originally, the number of extensions 
was unlimited. However, effective October 
of this year, a maximum of three extensions 
was imposed, for a total of 39 months of cash 
assistance (freeing up between $17 and $28 
million dollars for the state, depending on 
whom you ask). 

Those who can demonstrate two or more 
barriers to employment, like drug addiction 
or severe mental health problems, may extend 
their benefits for up to 60 months. A clinical-
ly depressed mother whose child has chronic 
asthma, for example, might qualify for an 
additional three extensions. Only one excep-
tion to the 60-month rule exists: violent 
domestic abuse rendering an adult unemploy-
able. Aside from that, families are on their 
own. "One of the biggest points is that peo-
ple are being abandoned," says Quickmire. 
"The state calls them 'leavers' but a lot of 
these folks don't have any other choices." 

Those dropped from the rolls may still 
qualify for other benefits, such as food 
stamps, Medicaid, and child care. Families 
with federal housing subsidies keep their 
homes, and their rent falls to zero if welfare 
payments were their only income. "But service 
providers and government officials still 
foresee a crisis in the near future-one with 
no easy solution. 

S
o WHAT HAPPENS when cash benefits 
vanish? "The state made it clear that 
they weren't doing anything" to help the tran-
sition, says Quickmire. "There's no safety net 
any longer." 

Families finishing their last 
month of cash assistance receive no direction 
from the state beyond a mandatory exit inter-
view at the oss. In it, social workers tell them 
about other kinds of benefits for which they 
may still qualify and direct them to 2-1-1 
Infoline, a state-contracted referral service 
run by the United Way of Connecticut which 
distributes information about local service 
providers. 

Infoline services have proven woefully 
inadequate. 
"So far the experience of the 
United Way is that they're getting very few 
calls," says Ellen Scalettar, a former state leg-
islator who is now an advocacy coordinator 
for Connecticut Voices for Children, "and it's 
still unclear what the United Way can do 
when they do call." Quickmire questions the 
practicality of the referral service. "Infoline's 
not going to find people money. It's going to 
give them the number to our shelter and we're 
going to tell them it's already full." 

Most social service agencies have long 
been operating at or near capacity levels. 
Nevertheless, for many families, these non-

. . . largely unnoticed. No sign marks it as one of 
New Haven's six transitional centers for homeless youth. The 
blinds are usually shut and the lights almost always off. Standing on the 
sidewalk, I did not hear any voices coming from inside. Like the people 
it serves, it is almost invisible. 

Any resident of New Haven can tell you about their encounters 
with the city's homeless. Yet few can tell of their experiences with the 
homeless population under 25-a population with which we might 
have the most in common. 

New Haven formally acknowledged the problem of homeless 
youth a year and a half ago, when it formed a working committee to 
research the experiences of runaways from the city and its surrounding 
communities. The task has been difficult. When Eric Ashton, a former 
employee of City Hall and a member of the committee, was asked how 
many runaways call the streets of New Haven home, his response was, 
"We don't know the numbers. I have no clue. They're a population that 
is invisible." 

As I walked into the shelter, the "invisible" youth no longer had the 
streets for camouflage. In M Umoja House, two young men live with a
