T COULD HAVE BEEN ANY THURSDAY NIGHT. J had just returned from 
my second Durfee's run for Swedish Fish, my Chaucer paper was still 
not writing itself, and my bare-walled single was feeling lonelier than 
ever. I was bored, and I had to do something about it. I needed dis-
traction, something to take my thoughts off schoolwork. I was in the 
mood for the excitement you sometimes feel before a big night at a 
party or a bar filled with people, but I wanted to experience it without 
leaving my desk. As I clicked on "chat" and followed the computer 
screen to "northeast region," I began wondering how many other Yalies 
would also be online. And would I see anyone I knew? Perhaps all the 
rooms would already be full. As the dialogue box popped up and I 
selected "Connecticut 1," I asked what I was really looking for online

tonight. While I typed "Jordanzo Y" in the "name" box, a flood of pos-
sibilities hit me: Within the next 30 minutes I could conceivably find 
myself with a new best friend, free psychological counseling, a summer 
position as a houseboy, or even undressed in a random Stiles single with 
someone I'd never met before. I pressed the "enter" button, and instant-
ly a pea-green page filled the screen, along with a list of 50 names, 
among them "JasonCT29," "Yalecub_24,'' "oldnavyboyr9,'' "yale-
boyzo," and, my favorite, "spankyCT5'6_18obighairychest." Five of the 
so had "Yale" or "Y" in their screen name. The top of the screen read 
•welcome to Gay.com." 

Gay.com is a website devoted to supplying information on nearly 
every subject related to homosexuality. One can use it to search for area 
suppott groups, sift through gay-related news headlines, shop for 
clothes, search the personals, or log on to local gay chat rooms. I use it 
mainly to find sex. Clicking on the "chat" function reveals a list of 
men's chat room headings with locations all over the world, with four 
different regional rooms for the United Scares. Each heading is divided 
into hundreds of individual rooms, ranging from "Hrv: Positive" to 
•College Jocks" to "New York City." Each room holds up to 50 chat-
ters, who can create their own name and one-sentence descriptions. 
Some are quite tame: "Hey guys 19 y/o college boy with pic." Some are 
more suggestive: "Who wants to sneak into my house and not wake up 
my roommate?" Others seem to echo the thoughts of many Yalies who 
log on: "What's _up? Looking for friends, maybe more." 

Looking at everyone's description is like browsing through mer-
chandise on eBay. Many users give their "stars," a quick physical 
description of their age, height, weight, hair and eye color, and often 
genital size. Once you find an "item" of interest, click to enter a one-
on-one dialogue that could eventually lead to having that object rushed 
to your doorstep. My first time logging on I was surprised by how lit-
tle talking goes on in the chat room itself, since most of the action is 
taking place in personal instant messages. Any time after JPM, one can 
find at least one other Yale student in the three Connecticut rooms, and 
Sunday through Thursday after midnight, there can be as many as eight 
Yalies at once. 

Since I first visited the site out of curiosity as a freshman in the fall 
of 1999, more and more Yalies have been logging onto Gay.com. Back 
in 1999 more graduate students than undergraduates seemed to inhab-

it the rooms, but lately the balance has been tipping toward under-
graduates. I discovered Gay.com through friends, although many gay 
students first heard about it when the site was mentioned recently in a 
Rolling Swne article "To Be Gay At Yale." 

If someone is only interested in looking for sex partners and does-
n't want to deal with corning our, all he needs is ten minutes, a pseu-
donym, a laprop, and a roommate back home for the weekend, and no 
one outside of his "hook-up" will ever know who he is and what he is 
doing. One graduate student told me that using Gay.com can "wipe the 
slate clear; you can play with the closet, and break down the boundaries 
between being in and out of the closet." 

The anonymity is also hugely important for closeted students, who 
can log on and create a fictitious name and identity for themselves. 
Students no longer have to our themselves by showing up to Lesbian-
Gay-Bisexual-Transgendered Co-op meetings in order to meet and talk 
to their first gay friends; they can log on and have over 50 gay people 
eager to talk to them without having to leave their room. Gay.com 
allows them to be a patt of a gay Yale community, without exposing 
themselves. I think this anonymity is positive-it allows people to 
explore their sexuality without being labeled as bisexual or gay. A per-
son's newly discovered sexuality can be a big topic of conversation at 
Yale, and some people don't want to be talked about. Anonymity can 
be important for almost anybody, since having "Yalie looking for action 
NOW" in my description could become quite embarrassing on my way 
to Spanish the next morning if someone I knew were to ask if I got 
lucky last night. 


On Gay.com, conventional dating 
behavior does not apply. I don't feel the same 
pressure to invite my hook-up to dinner or 
call him three days afterwards. One student 
told me he even prefers not to hook up with 
Yalies, and instead goes after people from 
around New Haven to avoid any awkward 
campus confrontations. This is not at all 
uncommon-strippers, security officers, and 
firemen have all wandered into Yale dorms 
because of Gay. com. Since the computers 
are all about directness, efficiency, and 
objectivity, it is fitting that hook-ups 
planned by computer tend to get right to 
the point-
the action-bypassing nor-
mal barriers or social conventions. If you 
are tired of having to meet people 
through your circle of friends or extracur-
riculars, and then _having to make small 
talk or consume alcohol to get "in the 
mood" before the festivities begin, 
Gay.com can be a utopia.

description-6'2", 150 pounds, brown/blue, 
six-pack, college athlete?" More often than 
not, people lie about their weight, their age, 
or the time they spend at the gym, inflate 
their "Hot-or-Not" rating by three points, 
and give measurements in centimeters but 
label them inches. It seems as though these 
people believe that once they go through the 
trouble of showering, putting on the special-
occasion Abercrombie boxers, and inviting 
you up to their room, you won't 
care if the advertised six-pack is 
actually buried under an addi-
tional 35 pounds. It is common 
for people to ask, "u got a pic?" 
which should be a good way of 
assessing compatibility But the 
pictures often are too good to be 
true. My friends and I have 
received the exact same picture 
of a well-built, bleached-blond 
teenage boy in his backyard from 
four different people. I myself 
have also fallen victim to 
the 
dreaded 
"Photoshop 
date," 
where someone made his double chins disap-
pear with a mouseclick. 

EVERTHELESS, despite the raunchy 
biographies and screen names, 
Gay.com is used for more then hooking up 
with strangers in the middle of the night. Eric 
Moga, a psychology department research 
assistant, told me he logged on to Gay.com a 
lot after arriving in New Haven this summer 
not knowing anyone. Unfamiliar with the 
city, Moga said, "I used it to find where the 
clubs were, and to meet new friends." But he 
found mixed results over the summer: "It has-
n't worked for friends because the people were 
either socially inept or closeted boys." Online 
chat rooms became a social support network 
for him because "If you have something on 
your mind, you'll definitely find someone to 
listen." One person I talked to finds that he 
usually logs on "mainly from boredom," 
though, when nature has its way, "Every so 
often for sex." Another undergraduate 
describes how he logs on "Only when I'm 
procrastinating from doing work--once a 
week at most. I let myself sit in the chat room 
and see who messages me. Sometimes it's 30-
somethings from off-campus who act all 
sketchy. By the time it's a Yale student I'm too 
busy to talk." 

When talking about Gay.com and other 
chat rooms with many gay students at Yale, I 
sensed that people were ashamed to admit 
42 
they go online. This fear seems to come from 
a belief that in admitting that he meets peo-
ple using a computer, someone is admitting 
that incompetence in real life has forced him 
to use computers to find friendship and sex. 
One Yale student becomes irate when people 
associate his use of Gay.com with despera-
tion. He emphasizes that the function of chat 
rooms for some people are not much different 
from what a bar provides for many others: a 
place where people can meet new friends and 
find someone to listen to them. He claims, 
"It's a normal community. It's not about des-
peration." 

Although many gay students know 
about Gay.com, some refuse to go online. 
This is tragic, because in Yale's gay scene the 
shelves can always use restocking. And while 
Gay.com has been a hit within the gay male 
community, there seems to be no use within 
Yale's lesbian community. There are ten dif-
ferent geographical room headings for men to 
enter, but women are left with only one head-
ing: "worldwide women." Lauren Mangini, 
the coordinator for Yalesbians, says it has 
never occurred to her to explore Gay.com, 
"Even if Yale is a barren desert of a dating 
scene, it's probably better than online--that 
seems kinda sketch." Mangini suggests that 
women value face-to-face interaction more 
when meeting people. Though I think men 
are just more willing to have sex with 
strangers. 

Despite all its possibilities, Gay.com has 
brought more disappointment than satisfac-
tion. After rwo years of using Gay.com, I 
often find myself asking, "Am I the only per-
son on here who actually looks like his 
But most disappointment on Gay.com is 
brought on by what I refer to as the "wishful 
thinking fallacy". This is when we fill in the 
unknown details about the person we are 
talking to online to make him what we want 
him to be. For example, if someone were to 
type "This New Haven winter makes me 
want to lie in bed all day and think of the 
beach," I would internally process this remark 
as, "Come over and let's spoon under the cov-
ers all night, and the warmth will remind me 
of my summer days surfing and lifeguarding 
at the beach, and oh, did I mention I just 
turned 17?" The excitement of creating such 
fantasies can keep one logged onto Gay.com 
well after bedtime. The source of these fan-
tasies, what really keeps you online, is the 
faint hope that the person you have spotted 
around campus, and dreamed about since 
freshman year, whom you have always hoped 
would someday rurn out to be gay, may per-
haps 
be 
person 
hiding 
behind 
"Yalekid2o."
