\\ y OU SEE, IT's UKE THIS," EXPLAINS WANDA, crack analyst for Action McNews in 
Tom Tomorrow's comic This Modern World. "The terrorists HATE FREE-
DOM." Very few explanations of our current situation have gone beyond this thick-
black-line simplicity. When politicians or pundits talk about a threat to "American 
values" or "democratic freedoms" they're using code words, and assuming that 
everyone has the same decoder ring. That's why it's such a pleasure to read a care-
fully reasoned and gracefully written book interrogating these overused and ill-
defined phrases. If nothing else, Jed Rubenfeld's Frmiom and Tim~ is the prod-
uct of a cooler head prevailing. 

Rubenfeld's project, as the title suggests, is no less than to redefine free-
dom, and then to re-reconcile constitutional government with democracy on 
the basis of this new understanding. Rubenfeld, Robert R. Slaughter 
Professor of Law at Yale Law School, was a philosophy major at Princeton. 
Hence the unusual composition of the book-at once a philosophical trea-
tise, a piece of legal theory, and a work of cultural criticism. 

Part 1 begins with a discussion of the posrmodern predicament. We 
commonly take freedom to mean living in the present. In pursuit of this 
freedom, we reject the shackles of history, revere youth, fear death, and 
prostrate ourselves on the altar of instant gratification : "Obey your 
thirst." But this ideal is, in practice, both exhausting and profoundly 
boring. "'Nothing new under the sun' is a pre-modern sentiment," 
writes Rubenfeld . "Only in the modern era does being new itself 
become old, opening up an ennui unknown to prior times." 

This may sound like coffeehouse existentialism, and it more or 
less is. Does this dilemma have any bearing on our day-to-day exis-
tences? Rubenfeld is strongest on the subject of how wispy philo-
sophical constructS and unexamined assumptions make their way 
into our daily lives in the form of laws. Our poll-driven political 
life is based on the assumption, dating 
back to Rousseau, that the ultimate 
democratic act is an act of speech. The 
idea that self-government is or should be 
the "voice of the people," discussion, 
debate, dialogue, instandy expressed and 
instantaneously registered, is the political 
analogue to the ideal of life in the 
moment. 

Here, Rubenfeld enters into a debate 
in American legal theory raging back to 
Jefferson. The "speech-based" model of 
democracy opens up a contradicti~n 
between self-government and the cofisti-
tution in its basic function: as a guarantee 
of civil rights and civic procedures against 
the vagaries of popular opinion. As long 
as "the voice of the people" is the ultimate 
justification for government, no written 
law, no matter how "fundamental," can 
stand in contradiction to popular will. 

Only a strong constitution can 
defend democracy, but it must withstand 
democracy as well. Rubenfeld dismisses 
prior attempts to resolve this contradic-
tion with reference to "the voice of the 
people" past, present, or future. One can't 
logically uphold the Constitution against 
present popular will on the basis of pre-
sent popular will. Nor can consitutional 
rights be justfied with reference to the 
"founding moment" -why should the 
will of the dead take precedence over that 
of the living? Nor yet can anti-majority 
rights be justified on the basis of future 
majority will-that way lies totalitarian-
ism. 

Rubenfeld goes even further in his 
attack on the popular will, perhaps the 
most cherished truism in all of American 
politics. "Collective will is a fiction," 
Rubenfeld writes, "... a 'meaningless,' 
'irrational,' 'self-contradictory' fiction. 
Hence we should stop thinking of democ-
racy in terms of collective will and collec-
tive self-governance." He supports this idea 
with a complex piece of analytic philoso-
phy called a "Condorcet paradox." In any 
election with three or more candidates 
where the public can register both a first 
and second choice (as in a primary and 
runoff, for example), there is a chance the 
results will be dose to the following: one 
third for Bush first and Gore second, one 
third for Gore first and Nader second, and 
one third for Nader first and Bush second. 
That means a solid two-thirds "majority 
will" simultaneously prefers each candidate 
to the two others. This formal analysis may 
strike some as chicanery, but it does point 
to a lamentable simplicity in our under-
standing of the term "voice of the people." 

Having undermined our form of gov-
ernment, Rubenfeld must find a new justi-
fication for constitutional democracy. In 
Part II of the book, Rubenfeld re-construes 
the relationship between constitutionalism 
and self-government. These sections of the 
book are where Rubenfeld's intelligent, 
economical writing style is most helpful, as 
he walks the reader calmly over rocky theo-
retical ground. By factoring in the dimen-
sion of time, he solves the apparent contra-
dictions in the variables "self," "society," 
and "law." It takes time for a person to 
become a human being, it takes time for a 
people {what Rubenfeld calls a "populari-
ty") to become a polity, and it takes time 
for an injunction to become a law. "Law is 
prophecy," he says, quoting Oliver Wendell 
Holmes. A law, proclaimed at time one, has 
no meaning until it is upheld at time two. 
A person's decisions, made at time one, 
have no import until they are acted upon at 
time two. Therefore the ultimate democratic 
act is not speech at all but writing-an utter-
ance deepened by time. Constitutional provi-
sions are written commitments made by a 
people to itself, and in their fulfillment over 
time they make a people a people. 

Rubenfeld calls his constitutionalist phi-
losophy "commitmentarian," and his defini-
tion of commitment needs some elucidation. 
He draws an impor-
tant but subtle dis-
tinction 
between 
commitment 
and 
what he calls "pre-commitment," 
which also separates him from previous con-
stitutional theorists. He uses a literary refer-
ence that has become a trope of constitution-
al theory: Ulysses orders his sailors to tie him 
to the mast, knowing that his reason will 
abandon him when he hears the sirens call-
ing. Rubenfeld says this is in fact a metaphor 
for pre-commitment: Because of what you do 
at time one, you have no choice but to obey 
at time two, no matter how you might wish 
to change your mind. This form of constitu-
tionalism bears some relation to the 
Hobbesian social contract. Commitment, on 
the other hand, as Rubenfeld defines it, is a 
self-lawgiving. You may very well have exter-
nal reasons to follow through on a commit-
ment, but your most important reason is that 
you have an obligation to yoursel£ In a beau-
tiful 
reversal of the Ulyssean image, 
Rubenfeld points out that constitutional 
commitments actually tend to be made, like 
marriage proposals, in the heat of passion, 
their strictures guaranteeing against the 
"seduction of ... everyday, cost-benefit, pref-
erence-maximizing rationality." 

Rubenfeld spends Part III of the book 
outlining how his "commirmentarian" philoso-
phy applies to matters of constitutional law 
like discrimination and the right to privacy. 
Here he shows himself to be a solid liberal, 
defending the constitutionality of affirmative 
action, for example: "Racial minorities are 
unequal to other minorities under current law 
... Something has gone profoundly wrong in 
constitutional interpretation when 
t.he 
Fourteenth Amendment is read, as it is today, 
to make racial minorities virtually the only 
minorities in our entire legal system that can-
not be singled out for favorable treatment." 

As the more partisan portions of the work, 
these chapters are marginally less persuasive, 
or maybe it's only that they are denser in legal 
jargon. 

Rubenfeld himself told me in an inter-
view that this book, with its offbeat blend of 
philosophy and hard-nosed legal theory, "isn't 
going to be cited in any Supreme Court opin-
ions." But that's exactly its appeal to the inter-
ested layperson. The ideas are startlingly orig-
inal and the writing style clear, always sensi-
tive to the multilayered meanings of words, 
even lyrical at times. "In the end, it doesn't 
matter what we say to ourselves," he writes in 
the chapter called "Popularity." "We have no 
more choice about the people into which we 
are born than we do about our famj]y or 
body: While we speak, and regardless of what 
we say, a people is writing itself into history, 
the land its palimpsest, and we ourselves its 
characters." 

Reading this book made me "proud to be 
an American" in the way the flag-waving of 
the last two months has nor. This is precisely 
mo·re 
valuable 
to 
Americans than our origins: the tradition of 
free and open inquiry, protected by our laws, 
a tradition we enrich and ennoble by realizing 
it every day of our lives.
