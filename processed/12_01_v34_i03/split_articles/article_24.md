governmental service agencies are the only 
resource left. The state of Connecticut is 
relying on established service organizations to 
handle the flood of new clients with their 
existing levels of staffing and funding. Few in 
New Haven think that organizations will be 
able to handle increasing demand. "Everyone 
knows it's not sufficient," says Bob Solomon, 
director of the New Haven Housing 
Authority. 

"The people in services in our 
community are highly competent and dedi-
cated, but there isn't enough money." 
Money rations look lean for the shelters 
and pantries on the front lines this winter. 
Limited budgets and no additional state 
funding mean that service organizations 
won't be able to expand their operations. 
Moreover, the post-September II spirit of 
generosity that inspired so many donations to 
relief work and the American Red Cross may 
have inadvertently diverted d~nations away 
from smaller non-profits. 
According to 
Solomon, "there are reports that giving to 
agencies not connected with September n is 
suffering." At the state level, money will be 
equally hard to come by: On October 1, 
Governor Rowland signed legislation cutting 
$88 million from the budget for the coming 
year. Much of this will come out of social ser-
vices funding. 

Shelters are preparing for this winter's 
welfare cutoffs, but already, long before the 
first snow, there is little they can do. As early 
as August, local men's, women's, and family 
shelters were full, except Columbus House, 
which had a few open beds. Demand for 
beds stayed unusually high through the sum-
mer, when need normally lessens. In 
response, the New Haven Board of Aldermen 
made the unprecedented decision to keep 
open the emergency overflow shelter, a facili-
ty usually reserved for the colder months. 
One shelter worker, who wished to remain 
anonymous, lamented that even before cash 
assistance limits took effect, her shelter could 
not meet the needs of 
the community. "We 
turn so many people 
away all the time," 
she said. "Now it's 
getting worse. People are staying longer and 
longer." Allison Cunningham, the Executive 
Director of Columbus House, blames a lack 
of affordable housing for the longer shelter 
stays. "We can't get people out of the shelters, 
because where are they going to go?" 

Cunningham's question remains 
unanswered for most families coming off wel-
fare, but based on past experience, service 
workers can make some predictions. Families 
may not los·e their housing for some time 
after their benefits end; eviction takes time 
and some may have some money in the bank. 
When there is nothing left, families will like-
ly turn to relatives, saving the shelters as a 
final resort. If the family shelters are full, par-
ents will move in to single adult shelters, leav-
ing their children with relatives or friends. In 
the most dire cases, entire families will simply 
end up on the sueet.

deeds of families already dependenc on 
monchly visits to local pantries to keep food 
on the table, supplies may dwindle, according 
to NataSha Ray, president of Mothers For 
Justice, an advocacy group for homeless 
women. 

"Unless there's more money that 
goes through the food bank, the food pantries 
are not going to have enough food to give the 
families in New Haven." Some pantries are 
already experiencing difficulties. I called 2.11-
Infoline to find out where a hungry person in 
New Haven could go for groceries.

'M ALREADY SEEING MORE entire families 
walking in off the street waiting to see if 
there's housing," says Quickmire. These 
are grim rimes for New Haven's service work-
ers. 

As the fallout from welfare reform 
becomes evident, service providers are frus-
trated by the tardiness and meagerness of the 
state's response. "They claim they are starting 
to think about how this is going co affect 
them," a shelter worker remarked. 
"This 
should have been a long-term process." 

Despite state failure to provide a workable 
transition for families exiting welfare, local 
service providers maintain their efforts. They 
continue to deliver their services at maximum 
capacity. What's more, they are organizing to 
track families as they leave welfare, to prevent 
them from simply disappearing. 

An ad-hoc "collaborative" spear-headed 
by Quick.mire, Scalettar, and Barbara Tinney 
of New Haven Family Alliance emerged last 
August. A main objective is to collect reliable 
data about families leaving welfare--
Connecticut has failed to establish any com-
prehensive data collection project of its own. 
With new survey results in hand, the collabo-
rative hopes to lobby the legislature to redi-
rect funds towards social services. Christian 
Community Action has been circulating a 
petition statewide pointing out that without 
benefits many families will be living on 
poverty wages or nothing at all and calling on 
the state to use its "extraordinary resources 
and wealth to meet the basic needs of all 
Connecticut's children." 

Future advocacy goals are even more 
ambitious. "We're pushing for the restoration 
of cash assistance and the safety net," says 
Quickmire. Although the legislature ofren 
responds more favorably to the opinions of its 
suburban constituents than city-dwellers, the 
New Haven collaborative hopes they can 
change minds by putting a face to the blight 
created by welfare reform. 

They may be 
right. "The legislature ofren reacts to emer-
gency situations," says Bob Solomon. "It's 
ofren reactive, not proactive." In the long 
run, the legislature may act to improve life for 
Connecticut's poor, but it can't be counted on 
for immediate assistance. "There's not going 
to be any option for cash this year," says 
Quickmire. 

New Haven 
city government 
knows that wel-
fare reform and 
winter will test its 
"no freeze" policy 
of turning no one 
away from a shel· 
ter. Yet it remains 
committed 
to 
keeping 
people 
warm. 
Shelters 
cost money, and 
New Haven is 
one of the rare 
cities that spends cax dollars on the homeless. 
In faa, New Haven is one of the few local 
communities willing to provide services to 
the poor at all. Solomon says, "If you need 
emergency housing or food, New Haven is a 
place where you're more likely to get it." The 
same is true of eldercare and psychiatric ser· 
vices. Many of the towns surrounding NeW 
Haven choose not to provide social services.

regional plans, especially when it comes to 
alleviating pressures on cities to provide ser-
vices to poorer people," says Solomon. 

Therefore New Haven social services 
must ease the burden of poverty for people 
from across the region, not just in town. This 
is no accident. Anecdotes of 
from neighboring towns 
homeless people at the Green 
substantiated by the number of 
of-towners in local shelters. 
October, the New Havm 
reported that berween 27 and 31 
cent of shelter residents come 
other parts of the state or even from 
other states. 

According to Phil 
Voigt, the alderman who heads 
Haven's finance committee, the 
contributes directly to the dispro-
portionate burden on New Haven's 
shelters. "We have documentation 
that the state itself has sent people from the 
correctional agencies and literally dropped 
them off at New Haven's doorstep." 

Voigt's solution? Sue the state. "What 
we're looking for is that the surrounding state 
and towns pay their fair share," says Voigt. 
"We're sort of confident that this will work." 
Thomas Ude of the New Haven Corporation 
Counsel has been working with Voigt to 
develop a legal strategy that will ensure that 
the suit makes it to the higher courts. Ude 
hopes to have a working outline of the lawsuit 
by November 14. Voigt says he would like to 
issue the lawsuit as quickly as possible. "This 
welfare reform is not really welfare reform. 
It's just shifting the burden from federal gov-
ernments and states onto the municipalities." 

If Voigt and the collaborative get their 
way, New Haven may increase its capacity to 
provide emergency services to welfare leavers. 
As a short-term objective, this is crucial. Still, 
everyone recognizes that truly curtailing 
poverry will require a much deeper commit-
ment from the state than emergency relie£ 
·There's no investment in families who are 
low- or no-income on the part of the state, 
and I think it's criminal, frankly, in a time 
when we're the wealthiest per-capita state in 
the country," says Quickmire. 

Securing that kind of long-term invest-
~ ment in education, day-care and other ser-
vices will require challenging the prevailing 
v wisdom about welfare reform and poverty. 
Says Solomon, "People think if you reduce 
welfare rolls, you've succeeded." Even involv-
6 iog those kicked off welf.ue in the public con-
,f l'ersation is no easy task. Quickmire knows 
lo 
this from experience. "[Welfare leavers] don't 
want to talk about it. There's tremendous 
stigma attached to being poor now. They're 
made to feel like they've done something 
wrong even if they've played by all the rules." 

IF YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME TALKING with 
service workers, you notice a persistent ten-
sion in their outlook. On the one hand, their 
rhetoric often takes on the character of 
doomsday prophecy. They grimly rattle off a 
laundry list of problems that will proliferate 
in the coming months. "I think the crime 
rate is going to go up [and we'll see an] 
increase in the drug community because these 
women are going to do whatever they need to 
do to feed their kids and put a roof over their 
heads," Ray predicts. 

Another explained, 
"We're being trained to think we're going to 
have to deal with lots more depression. If you 
don't know how you're going to feed your 
kids the next day, you would be depressed 
too." But much of the time, service workers 
find themselves in the same position as their 
clients: powerless to look beyond the next
