Senior Yale political science 
professors James Scott, Rogers Smith (now 
at the University of Pennsylvania), and Ian Shapiro, 
as well as 14 other eminent scholars, reacted with a mix of 
bewilderment, curiosity, and commiseration. Scott, rather than delet-
ing what might have been perceived as bombastic spam, replied. Smith 
and Shapiro were more suspicious, but as the manifesto began ro cir-
culate on the internet they could not avoid the growing Perestroika 
buzz. "People who received [the message] forwarded it to others," 
Smith told me. "I didn't, but so many did that soon there were just 
hundreds of people talking about this letter around the country." 
To accommodate the flood of interest, Mr. Perestroika created a 
lisrserv on Yahoo.com, and before long academic heavyweights, includ-
ing Harvard's Theda Skocpol, the University of Chicago's Susan 
Hoeber Rudolph and John Mearsheimer, and Yale's Scott, Smith, and 
Shapiro, were fulminating online about the state of political science. 
Mr. Perestroika, it seemed, had tapped a fount of academic angst. 
•Even though none of us who received the letter would have agreed 
with every statement in ir," Smith admitted, "nonetheless it touched a 
nerve with a number of political scientists, including me, who were 
unhappy about the state of the profession." 
Mr. Perestroika bemoaned the rise in APSA of a "coterie" of schol-
ars who use highly mathematical methods. The organization's quarter-
ly journal, the Ammcan Political Scimc~ Review (APSR), has become 
OVerwhelmingly quantitative in recent years-75 percent of the articles 
fiom the last four years were either statistical or formal, according to 
the journal's editor-in contrast to the discipline's traditional emphasis 
on qualitative methods. Moreover, trendy formal methods, such as 
rational choice theory, which uses economic and mathematical models 
to derive universal political postulates, are gradually supplanting quali-
Jative techniques like fieldwork and case studies. Mr. Perestroika 
believed that the increasing emphasis on quantitative methods was 
diminishing the relevance of political science to the real world. 


Within days, communal anguish turned to collective action. In 
November, Smith sent a scathing letter with 125 signatures to APSA and 
ita 13000 members. "An anonymous scholar writing as 'Mr. 
Perestroika,' circulated to an extensive roster of political scientists a pas-
sionate memo asking many provocative, indeed painful, questions," 
Smith fumed. "Why docs the APSR and why do other prominent pro-
fes-
sional fora seem 
so intensively focused on 
technical methods, at the expense 
of the great, substantive political questions 
that actually intrigue many APSA members, as well as 
broader intellectual audiences?" Decrying mathematical hegemo-
ny in the APSR, anti-democratic governance in APSA, and a general eli-
mare of fear among graduate students and junior faculty members, he 
urged the political science community ro heed the charges. "We believe 
strongly," he concluded, "that the profession is in danger of alienating 
a larger and larger number of those who should be its active members, 
and contributing less and less to the kinds of understanding of politics 
that it is our responsibility to advance." 
For centuries, scholars of politics have studied social movements 
and upheavals. Now political science had begun a revolution of its own. 


LONG BEFORE MR. PERESTROIKA BEGAN HIS MOVEMENT, Ian 
Shapiro was crusading for many of the same principles. Ever 
since the intense mathematicization of political science in the 
1970s, Shapiro had been wary of a growing faction of scholars who pro-
moted rigorous quantitative methodologies--especially rational choice 
theory. In 1994, in response to an external review ofYale's political sci-
ence department that censoriously noted the under-representation of 
quantitative methods, Shapiro and colleague Donald Green published 
a landmark book, Patho/ogUs of Rational Choic~ Th~ory, which angrily 
challenged the value of the theory on its own terms. Rational choice, 
they argued, postulates universal hypotheses about politics that often 
do not apply to the real world. Shapiro and Green worried that such 
method-driven approaches to political science could endanger the dis-
cipline. 


The publication of Pathologies of Rational Choic~ Th~ory brought 
the schism in political science into focus. In 1995-the year rational 
choice advocates at the APSA convention allegedly motioned with tom-
