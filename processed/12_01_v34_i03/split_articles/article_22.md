EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
left Bosnia in 1992, when I was ten. War had broken out that year and would not end until 1996, at 
vvhich point the country was cut in two. My hometown Visegrad is now part of the autonomous Serbian 
Republic. Because I am a Bosnian-Muslim, I cannot return. I go to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, instead. 
Displaced from my home, I returned last summer after spending half of my life in New York City. I took 
photographs throughout my four-month stay in Bosnia. Looking at the images when I returned to Yale, 
I was struck by how removed I am from them. I was an insider observing my country through an out-
sider's lens. No matter the subject of my photographs-shelled buildings, empty parks whose trees were 
cut down for fuel during the war, decrepit Communist housing projects-! observed from an uncom-
fortable distance. I could not divorce my view from my memories of the pre-war urban landscape of 
Sarajevo. I was looking at Bosnia trying to rebuild itself out of the shambles of war, still picking up pieces 
of the fallen Communist regime and facing a continued refugee crisis within its borders. These pho-
tographs reveal my separation from Bosnia; they also reflect my longing to return.
