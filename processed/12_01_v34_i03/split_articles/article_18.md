sure. In the months after Rogers Smith's open 
letter, the Perestroika listserv had been filled 
with agitating and strategizing, and its mem~ 
bers recommended Scott and others to the 
nominating committee. During the spring 
Executive Director of APSA Catherine Rudder 
called Scott and told him that he had been 
nominated to run for a seat on the APSA coun~ 
cil as a member of the official slate. Scott 
assumed that he had been nominated-basi~ 
cally elected, since slates are rarely 'opposed-
because of his involvement in the movement, 
but Rudder assured him that it had "nothing 
to do with Perestroika, but rather with [his) 
qualifications." Scott was not convinced. 
Straussians, deconstructionists, an4il- interna~ 
tiona! relations specialists), Smith and 
Shapiro are more restrained. Smith maintains 
that Perestroika is not a "cohesive cadre." 
Shapiro, who has distanced himself from the 
movement since the initial flurry of activity, 
now considers himself more of an interested 
"participant in conversations." He even 
referred to Perestroika as "a little bit para~ 
noid." 


But in his candidacy, Scott declared him~ 
self the "delegate from Perestroika" and out~ 
lined broad plans for Perestroika reforms. "I 
will pr~s on every possible occasion to make 
the APSA more plural and democratic," he 
wrote. "I will do whatever I can to ensure that 
we create a professional climate where junior 
faculty and graduate students who believe 
that they represent dissenting intellectual era~ 
ditions will never again feel the need for the 
cover of anonymity to speak frankly ... The 
APSA has become, I believe, progressively 
more sectarian and oligarchic." He also 
vowed to make the APSR, which he claims 
most professors toss directly into the trash, 
more accessible to the rest of academia. "[The 
APSRJ is really a Rube Goldberg machinery 
designed to get people tenure and not have 
any relevance to the external world," he told 
me. 

The APSA objected to Scott's tendentious 
statement, requesting that he reduce it to a 
simple biography. Scott refused. All the can-
didates' statements were held for months 
before the committee finally allowed Scott's 
to stand. Perestroika, it seemed, had secured a 
victory. Like the rebellious peasants he stud-
ies, Scott suddenly found himself pushed into 
the heart of the revolution. 
"Why else would I have, aU of a sudden, a 
warm corporate embrace from APSA," he 
asked, "which had never nominated me for 
anything in the course of a JO~year career?" 
Unsure of whether to accept the nomina~ 
cion- was APSA trying to co~opt the move-
ment?-he e~mailed Perestroika headquarters 
and received a thumbs~up. "They said, 'We'll 
take what we can get,'" he remembers. "So I 
said 'What the hell?'" 
Although 
Scott 
talks 
about 
the 
Perestroika movement almost as if it were a 
revolutionary party (consisting of, as he put 
it, "people who would be at one another's 
throats in lots of other contexts," like

Perestroika movement had gained 
much ground. APSA had bowed to 
pressure and announced that it would publish 
a new journal and refund subscriptions to the 
APSR, rumors of governance reforms in APSA 
had emerged, and Scott had infiltrated the 
council. But many wondered how much 
more the movement could accomplish. 
Genuine change in the profession, some 
wrote on the listserv, could only be achieved 
in "the trenches" of colleges and universities. 
Mr. Perestroika himself warned followers not 
to feel "elated at our miniscule victories." But 
the Perestroika movement had at least man路 
aged to bring life to the decrepit, stodgy orga路 
nization upon which it originally set its crici路 
cal gaze and to the field itself Every political 
scientist in the country was talking about 
APSA, the APSR, or the condition of the disci路 
pline. As Mr. Perestroika wrote to me in an 
email, "Hopefully the wider academic com-
munity will wake up to the increasing irrele-
vance of political science to many 'real' polit-
ical questions because of its strict adherence 
to methodological orthodoxy. Our movement 
seeks to make all of us more relevant and 
more critical." Scott, Smith, Shapiro, and 
others had all "woken up" to Mr. Perestroika's 
clarion call. 

In late August, the "Perestroikaniks," as 
James Scott calls his comrades, met for the 
first time in person, at the APSA annual con-
ference 
in 
San 
Francisco. 
Prominent 
Perestroika names, junior faculty members, 
and graduate students, including some of 
Yale's crusaders, all convened to celebrate, dis-
cuss, and strategize. Wine glasses in hand, 
nearly 300 people attended a jubilant recep-
tion, and hundreds more attended panels 
with tides like "Perestroika: Undisciplined, 
Unpunished," and "Shaking Things Up? 
Future Directions in Political Science." A 
larger crowd packed the Perestroika coming-
out party than the APSA President's reception 
nc:n door. Mr. Perestroika never revealed his, 
her, or their identities. But, with so much 
accomplished and so much more to do, it 
seemed as if no one really cared.
