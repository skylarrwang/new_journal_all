EN PM. I could have been watching television, hooking up with 
the hot girl I met the previous night when I accidentally burnt 
a hole through her dress, or simply enjoying the peaceful tran-
quility of a Sunday evening. Instead I was four blocks east of Old 
Campus, down some alley, past a Dunkin Donuts, and inside the Tune 
Inn, where four scantily clad freaks led by art school gross-out band 
GWAR's Slymenstra Hyman were preparing to bare all in The Girly 
Freak Show, a "liaison with the exotic and erotic." I tried to make 
myself at home among the belligerent drunks and the disturbingly 
friendly punks wh,o kept on encouraging me to roll. I stayed sober, 
calm, and eager. I thought anything headlined by "The Pain Proof 
Rubber Girl" had to be good. I was wrong. Billed as "exciting sexy 
shocking entertainment," the show would prove to be about as arous-
ing as the eight questionable winos surrounding me who had showed 
up to gawk at ass. 

When my gaze first met Slymenstra's piercing eyes, I was trans-
fixed, lost in a world in which she was the center and the creepy guy 
next to me didn't exist. She was Sly to her friends, Sly Hy on stage, and 
Hyman on the dotted line. But in my dreams she will always be 
Slymenstra. Sly was an absolute bitch on stage, discharging unprofes-
sionalism by the gallon. In a sheer gol.d lame dress cut just 
below the belly button, matching six-inch heels, and a 
curly pink wig, she was kitschy and egregiously rude. She 
started by attacking innocent audience 
members. At one point she mercilessly 
ridiculed an elderly man in a polka-dot-
ted jacket and "Marine Corpse" hat who 
was giddily hopping up and down with 
a giant picture of Hyman as if he were a 
card girl at a title bout. He begged her 
for a hug, but Hyman refused: "You're 
way too fragile for me, old man." T he 
poor guy was dejected, the crowd was 
disheartened, and I was eager for the 
"Pussy Whipping Cowgirls" to take the···~~ 
stage. 

I refocused my energy. The opening 
act seemed promising. "The Pain Proof 
Rubber Girl," a snobbish chick who fas-
tened flaming knives to her hands and 
danced in circles. She was outlandish yet 
enticing. But her act sucked. The audience 
soon grew tired of her boring dancing, so she varied things a little by 
trampling on pieces of charred glass and eating them. My heart surged. 
I wanted to rush on stage and stop her. I could handle the bad danc-
ing, but I couldn't bear the thought of Rubber Girl's mangled body in 
front of me. T hen, I noticed a four-second delay between her move~ 
ments and the sound of the breaking glass. My concern turned to dis-
illusionment. 

Slymenstra's second act was unsurprisingly weak. Her highly antic-
ipated "pussy whipping" exhibition fell short of my expectations as she 
struggled to get her whip up. She hurled it toward the ceiling, prepar-
ing to punish the Rubber Girl, but kept getting the thing stuck 
between a disco ball and an exposed water pipe. I looked over my 
shoulder to see the unusually quiet crowd's reaction. The inebriated old 
men and pill-popping yo~ngsters were disappointed by her impotence. 
Who wouldn't be? 

Sensing the need to relax and regroup, Hyman asked the audience 
for a cigarette. No one complied. We weren't about to give her nicotine 
until she gave us a decent show. Since she didn't have any cigarettes, 
Hyman ate worms instead. Or at least she pretended to. After closely 
inspecting the slimy creatures, I saw that they were about as real as 
Rubber Girls' 36cs. The polka-dot guy, stiH upset and hug-less, 
noticed this too. He mumbled something and drunkenly 
walked off. I couldn't have agreed more. 

After consuming the worms, Hyman took off her 
top and asked the audience to participate in a moment 
of silence for "Koochie Kamanda," a Freak Show regu-
lar who had injured her throat during a sword swallow-
ing accident. Was I sympathetic? Hardly. Koochie 
had evaded this dreadful night. I would have trad-
ed places with her in a second, wounded esophagus 
and all. I left the Tune Inn ten dollars and one hour of 
my life poorer. But at least I met her. I am thinking of 
blazing flames, taSty worms, cracking whips, the 
refuge of art. This is the only immortality you 
and I may share, my Slymenstra.
