EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
the case had dragged on for four years. In 
unusually strong terms, he chastised the tech-
niques that Navrozov and the Society used in 
court: "[Their] complaint is rife with refer-
ences to the University's history, its economic 
structure, the 'secret societies at Yale,' and a 
multitude of other allegations patently irrele-
vant to this action." He could not contain his 
amazement at Navrozov's persistence: "It is at 
best curious and at worst bizarre that plain-
tiffs fail to acknowledge the fact that the 
University prevailed in each of these proceed-
ings." 

Again "unbowed" by the outcome of the 
trial, Andrei Navrozov continued in a literary 
career as a translator and journalist. In a 
recent review he wrote on Thomas Harris's 
Cannibal, he stated that he and his Russian 
friends, after years of discussions, have come 
to agree that "every man alive has more ene-
mies than he has friends." 

The Russians did not succeed in taking 
over the the Lie-but another unexpected 
group would attempt to do just that. The 
magazine lay dormant during most of the 
trial, but in 1989, students who were officers 
Party of the Right registered its own board 
under the name of the Yale Literary Magazine. 

Both groups demanded to be recognized 
as the editors of the new Lit. 

During deliberations by Dean of Student 
Affairs Betty Trachtenberg, the Party of the 
Right pulled out a surprising document;. a let-
ter from Andrei Navrozov, which declared 
that he had sold the name of the Yak Literary 
Magazine to the Party of the Right for 
$x.oo-the very name which the federal court 
had definitively established as belonging to 
the University, not Navrozov. After a bureau-
cratic scramble, the Parry of the Right lost its 
claim to the name and the literary board was 
allowed to re-register as an undergraduate 
organization in September 1989. Yet to this 
day; the Parry of the Right has a quote from 
Â·Andrei Navrozov prominently posted on 
their web page: "The Party of the Right i.s a 
group of people who prefer a bad paradox to 
a good cliche." 

The new board of the Lit requested 
$130.67 
from 
the 
Undergraduate 
Organizations Funding Committee to sup-
port the rebuilding and restructuring of the 
current editors-in-chief Emily Weiss and 
Zach Weinman, the magazine fell into debt 
after last spring's issue. Four college 'masters 
donated $500 each to pay the debt. If the 
magazine goes over budget again, the cost will 
be bursar billed to the accounts of the editors-
in-chief, who will nor be permitted to register 
for classes or graduate until the bill is paid. 

Thus seems to be the fate of the Lit-
like 
Madame Ravensky in Chekhov's The Cherry 
Orchard, a noble name fallen upon hard times 
and beleaguered by crackpots.
