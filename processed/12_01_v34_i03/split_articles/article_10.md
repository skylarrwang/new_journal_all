biological neurons," Bostrom explains. "If 
computers can work one thousand times 
faster, so can your brain." 

Bostrom also encourages the develop-
ment of "smart drugs" that would enhance 
cognitive performance--like steroids for the 
mind. He has no problem with self-medicat-
ing. Medicines should be like food, Bostrom 
says. "If a different substance is required to 
make a better life, the fact that it is unnatur-
al shouldn't be an argument against it." 

Since much of this technology is still in 
development, the way to live in accordance 
with the Transhumanist ethos, according to 
Bostrom, is to exercise, eat healthfully, not 
smoke, avoid high-risk activities, use email, 
drink copious amounts of caffeine, and chew 
nicotine gum (it "increases concentration"). 

As Bostrom explains this, the robotic voice 
from Radiohead's "Fitter Happier" replays in 
my mind: "Fitter, Happier, More productive, 
Comfortable, Not drinking too much, 
Regular exercise at the gym .... " And, of 
course, as good Transhumanists, we should 
make sure that we are frozen in liquid nitro-
gen, instead of being cremated or buried, 
when we finally die. 

Not surprisingly, the prospect of increas-
ing cognitive abilities through a variety of 
means has played well at Yale. "The feedback 
bas been extremely enthusiastic!" Bostrom 
exclaims. A Transhumanist working group 
comprised primarily of Yale researchers and 
faculty has been established, and Bostrom 
hopes to offer a class on Transhumanism next 
fall. "The reason I wanted to do the class was 
because of a lack of opportunity among 
undergraduates to think about the future of 
the species," Bostrom says. For Bostrom, an 
understanding of Transhumanism is crucial 
for students since, "Transhumanism will 
affect everything from institutions and eco-
nomic systems to study techniques," and, 
after all, "the undergraduate may live to see 
these things happen."
