the afternoon off to watch 30 Rock reruns and take a nap 
partially eliminates some of the disadvantages of that 
postponement of work.

One method to streamline this active procrastination 
is an invention of Stanford philosophy professor John 
Perry, what he calls “structured procrastination.” He 
encourages self-deception: Procrastinators should 
complete small, lower-priority jobs to build affirmation 
and energy toward the bigger tasks. In other words, 
postpone that term paper, but catch up on emails or 
on news in the meantime instead of sitting at your desk 
not writing your paper but not doing anything else. It’s 
simply productive procrastination. 

Continuously grieving over the passage of time may 
well be an essentially human state, but there are ways to 
grieve intelligently. 

Researchers point to the benefits of controlled and 
concerted indulgence in procrastination, and any lay-
procrastinator can tell you that a break, whether you 
spend it watching Seinfeld or spend it mind-wandering, 
can make the ensuing hours of work more productive. 

David found himself stuck in loops of words that lacked 
meaning and logic, and fixated on seemingly impossible 
deadlines. He may not clearly have seen the value of 
food breaks his friends were taking, or their practice of 
switching off between subjects. 

And anyway, punishing or disciplining yourself 
over a procrastination problem is not an effective 
way to eliminate the habit. In a recent study, Carleton 
University psychology professor Michael Wohl found 
that those who forgive themselves for one bout of 
procrastination are not only less stressed, but also less 
likely to procrastinate in round two. Because the self-
forgivers were less likely to procrastinate, they also 
performed better. 

Perhaps I do procrastinate, without calling it so—
of course I don’t do every task I know I will have to do 
at the first possible point. My HBO Go account often 
gets top billing, and so does my naptime. But I don’t 
beat myself up over not being perfectly efficient, and 
I’m more relaxed for it (and my apartment is cleaner, 
and dinner with my roommate more delicious). That lost 
time, in other words, isn’t wasted in the end.
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the 	
       cold wind 
That blows before and after time, 
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs 
Time before and time after.

M
ariana Ornagua did not seem like the kind 
of patient who would give a doctor trouble. 
She had gone out of her way to be tested for 
tuberculosis in mid-November, waiting in line after her 
English class at the New Haven Adult Education Center 
to see the visiting TB nurse. A few days later, Ornagua 
took more time out of her schedule to get her results. 
The tiny bit of TB protein that had been injected into 
her forearm had raised a dark reddish welt about the 
size of a penny: a sign that the disease was present in her 
body. The nurse told Ornagua that the Winchester Chest 
Clinic could determine whether or not her immune 
system was keeping the disease in check—whether her 
TB was latent or active. She followed the nurse’s advice 
and set up an appointment at the Winchester as soon as 
she could. 

Her cooperation with the medical system continued: 
On November 30, she showed up for her appointment 
at the Winchester, located within Yale-New Haven 
Hospital. When she was given a bright green mask, she 
dutifully put it on and let herself be whisked into an 
examining room. 

Ornagua is a slight woman of thirty-two, with a 
shy smile visible behind a cascade of hair. (To protect 
the patient’s identity, her name has been changed.) To 
most of us, there would be nothing remarkable about 
the image of her sitting in the examining room, her coat 
scrunched in her lap. All she had done was show up for 
a medical appointment. But in the eyes of the medical 
system, her presence at the Winchester on November 
30th was a sign that she could be trusted. 

The populations in the United States who are 
most likely to be infected with TB are the homeless, the 
alcoholic, the drug-addicted, and recent immigrants. If 
you don’t speak English, don’t have a permanent place 
of residence, are juggling two jobs, or have run afoul of 
the law, a hospital is a scary place, with its endless series 
of official forms to fill out and its hierarchy of orderlies, 
nurses, residents, and doctors, all of whom seem to wield 
a God-like power over what happens to your body. Once 
you enter, it seems that you give up whatever autonomy 
you had outside, and so you are unlikely to seek out a TB 
test. If you do get tested and are positive, you are unlikely 
to show up for your appointment. And if you do show 
up for your appointment and have active TB, you are 
unlikely to finish the course of your treatment, because 
the medications will alleviate most symptoms after the 
first couple of weeks and the medications have some 
nasty side effects, including vomiting, stomach aches, 
urine discoloration, extreme lethargy, and a potentially 
fatal inflammation of the liver.

Up to thirty-one percent of recorded TB patients 
X-rays of  patients with TB. Chest x-rays are a key tool for 
diagnosing active forms of  the disease and allow specialists to see 
infection or holes in the lung tissue.
