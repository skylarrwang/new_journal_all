EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The challenge to humanize hitchhiking pushed 
Bradford to teach a “Hitchhiking 101” workshop at the 
People’s Art Collective’s (PAC) New Haven Free Skool 
last fall. He decided to create a one-hour crash course, 
which he taught to two different groups of students 
from Yale and the New Haven community.

In the workshops, Bradford conducted role-playing 
exercises so the class could practice strategies for 
attracting and interacting with potential rides. Hitchhikers 
should stand in visible spots on highway entrance 
ramps and hold signs stating where they’re headed, 
Bradford explained. For safety’s sake, they should avoid 
hitchhiking at night, or in inclement weather. Ultimately, 
a hitchhiker must trust his or her instincts about drivers. 
“You’re never under an obligation, just because someone 
pulled over, to get in the car with them” said Bradford.

New Haven native Liba Judd, 18, who volunteers 
at the PAC, started hitchhiking last year on her way 
back from an Earth First conference in Pennsylvania. 
She says she is often asked whether hitchhiking is a 
more dangerous venture for women than for men, but, 
like Bradford, she is quick to point out that the same 
question applies to both driver and hitchhiker: Can you 
trust strangers? “If somebody’s going to take advantage 
of a woman, I don’t think it’s likely that hitchhiking is 
going to exacerbate it,” Judd said.

Of course, a hitchhiker’s success depends as much 
on drivers’ prejudices as his or her efforts to follow the 
hitchhiking code. While Bradford, who is white, said he 
could not speak for hitchhikers of other demographics, 
he emphasized the general importance of maintaining 
a clean appearance while on the road. “Every good 
hitchhiker or vagabond traveler knows that you wear 
dark clothes because they hide the dirt and make you 
look cleaner,” he said. “Also I could see how the time 
I would have to wait for a ride would get longer as my 
beard got longer.”

Yet what emerges from talking to Bradford and 
Greenberg was how the experience, whether hitching 
or driving, shaped their attitude towards strangers. “I 
think the true beauty of learning about hitchhiking and 
picking them up is life-affirming,” Greenberg said. “It’s 
saying to the world, ‘I’m not afraid to invest in a stranger 
and to trust them, and to really be vulnerable.’” 

Bradford was amazed that single women with 
small children in their car would stop for him without 
a question. When he told middle-aged drivers that he 
regularly slept in ditches, they’d give him money for a 
motel room. (“Then you buy a beer with the money,” 
Bradford chuckled, “And you still sleep in a ditch.”) 

Greenberg asked Beef and Tom if they would tell 
her stories, and they did. Tom spoke of the wife who 
had left him, of the car another hitchhiker stole from 
him on the way to a Phish concert, of an older woman 
who made unwanted sexual advances, and of the cousin 
in Maryland he was trying to reach. Beef came from a 
wealthy Allentown family and attended St. Paul’s school 
in New Hampshire, but his family kicked him out of 
the house. He’d spent time in jail for petty theft before 
hitting the road. 

Bradford, who still lives and works in New Haven, 
plans on writing a book about his hitchhiking experience 
to “both share the stories and people that I’ve met, and 
also talk about the culture of hospitality and the culture 
of trust.” He picks up hitchhikers whenever he can. 

As Judd said, “If you’re in a car with somebody for 
four hours,” or twelve, as she once had the luck to be, 
“you’re going to talk to them and get to know them, 
even if it’s not a really deep relationship.” And any 
hitchhiker will tell you, that’s much better than nothing.

**Title: Out of Water**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

I go to the shore whenever I can. I like to watch 
the light fall in tinselly strips on the rippled waves and 
hear it slosh against bridges or beaches. Over these past 
few years in New Haven, I have often found company 
there. In seaside parks and industrial lots where New 
Haven’s rivers converge, I have watched fishermen as 
they wait for the bend at the ends of their rods, hoping 
for a bite on the hook hanging into the sea. But in late 
winter, the shoreline empties. At all of the usual spots—
the bridge, the parks, the underbelly of highways—no 
one is fishing. 

When I walk into Dee’s Bait and Tackle in Fair 
Haven on a Friday afternoon in February, I see seven 
fishermen sitting, standing, and leaning against counters 
around the shop with styrofoam cups of coffee. They 
shout about routes and exits and lakes and tides—was 
it route 7? Exit 34? Lake Wintergreen? What about that 
undertow?—and discuss the quality of ice in this pond 
or that one, debating whether you need a permit to fish 
in such and such a park. 

Pete DeGregorio inherited this store from his 
father in 2005, who opened the shop with Pete’s uncle 
in 1956. Holding his sleeping granddaughter in his arms, 
DeGregorio asks if I want coffee. 

DeGregorio explains that he has twice as many 
people hanging out in his shop during these cold winter 
months, but fewer customers than in the summer. At 
the counter, Mark Pelletier is crimping some of Dee’s 
handmade leaders, steel wires that connect the hook 
or lure to the main line so that big sea fish can’t bite 
through them. He chimes in to say that fishermen come 
to Dee’s when they can’t fish—because it’s too cold or 
the fish aren’t running—for the consolation of at least 
talking about fishing. 

“Some guys, only place they’ll come in the winter is 
here,” he says, stacking a leader in the pile on the counter. 

The fishermen huddle around the checkout counter 
as they talk, none of them buying. Above them, rods, 
minnow traps, eel pots, and crab baskets hang from 
the ceiling. Newspaper clippings and Polaroids full of 
smiling faces and big catches have yellowed and frayed 
on the walls. A bait menu and price list is tacked near the 
counter, advertising the night crawlers, wigglers, sand 
eels, and bunker chums.

Many small bait shops have struggled in recent 
years, suffering from competition with the increasing 
number of big box stores—DeGregorio says you can 
throw a rock from the roof of his shop to a Wal-Mart 
down the block—but Dee’s has something many of the 
other shops don’t: a volunteer workforce.

“If I get busy, customers jump behind the counters 
and grab bait for me,” DeGregorio says. “My customers 
are really pushy salesmen.”

Pelletier and others pass many days grabbing bait, 
making leaders, helping customers, painting the steps 
outside, giving casting lessons, cleaning up the front 
yard, and more—all without pay. They teach wannabe 
fishermen how to reel in catch from the New Haven 
shoreline.

People may go to Wal-Mart for the cheap equipment, 
but there is often more to fishing than having a rod. 
DeGregorio runs behind the counter and grabs a shiner 
that Wal-Mart had sold to a father-son pair who wanted 
to catch snappers a few years back. It was two inches too 
long. The snappers wouldn’t bite.	


The extended family of fishermen also includes 
people with different reasons for arriving at his shop and 
the shore. One middle-aged man walks in to buy bait for 
ice-fishing. He grew up coming to Dee’s with his father, 
but now the roles are reversed: Today, the son is taking 
his dad out on the ice. DeGregorio recalls one single 
mother who, a few years ago, would come in every day, 
buy $1.35 of bait, and catch dinner for her and her kids. 
Others dole out cash for sleek rods and fancy bait. 
“That’s the magic about fishing,” he says, his 
granddaughter still wrapped around his torso. “You 
throw your line in, and the fish doesn’t know how much 
your rod cost. Anyone could catch a really big fish.”

DeGregorio is determined to keep that magic alive 
in Fair Haven. 
“We’re here to stay,” DeGregorio says. 

As long as Dee’s stays, young fishermen who find 
their way to the shop will also find their way to the water, 
where they will wait for that tug at the end of their lines. 
I am no exception. Before I leave, a few fishermen 
give me their numbers. They say to call if I ever want to 
get on the water. Come March, they will help me find 
the fish.
