**Title: Gilding the Lyric**
**Author: Gideon Broshy**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

One minute at Lyric Hall and I was on stage, under 
the 1913 proscenium arch.  Dim yellow chandelier lights 
gave the brawny columns a static glow.  

I hadn’t played a piano with ivory keys since the old 
tattered one at my neighborhood music school.  Rough 
on the skin, this piano recalled the other’s grandmotherly 
world-weariness.  Plastic keys aren’t for John Cavaliere, 
the owner of the building and the proprietor of Lyric 
Hall Antiques and Conservation—they’ll never have the 
charm, the honesty of ivory.  He’s built his business, 
his home, and his life on preserving that honesty, on 
reviving the old and celebrating the forgotten. 

Founded in 1913 as a vaudeville house by Italian 
factory workers, Lyric Hall now plays three roles: that of 
Cavaliere’s antiques and conservation business, that of 
a performance space, and that of his home.  Cavaliere, 
who studied art at Connecticut College, is a master 
craftsman. He specializes in gilding, but also works with 
wood, metal and upholstery. He purchased Lyric Hall 
in 2006, and since 2010 it has hosted various theater 
productions, musical performances, and poetry readings. 

When I walked in at 2 p.m. on a Sunday, Cavaliere, 
who has a slim goatee and curly hair that creeps onto 
a wide forehead like ivy, greeted me and brought me 
straight into the theater at the back of the building. 
A teal 1930s cigarette machine offering Kents and 
Marlboros for 30 cents a pack stood conspicuously in 
the cold foyer.

The first objects to catch my eye were five golden, 
shell-like footlights that sat poised in a row upstage. 
Traditionally, ornaments of this sort were used to shield 
stage-illuminating candles from the wind. At Lyric 
Hall, armed with electric bulbs, they are less practical. 
Cavaliere laid new gold leaf on the old shells himself. 

When Cavaliere bought the building almost a century 
after its construction, it was in ruins. “Nobody knew it 
was a theater for eighty years,” he says. All that remained 
from its vaudeville days was the proscenium arch. Light 
projected into the theater space through cracks in the 
walls and gaping holes in the ceiling. Cavaliere tore 
away strata upon strata of flooring and carpeting, each 
layer corresponding variously to the building’s days, 
post-vaudeville, as a bicycle shop, a flower shop, a joke 
shop. He and a revolving cast of friends, craftsmen, 
and hired help tore away the filth, repainted the walls, 
replaced the ceiling, and redesigned the façade. They 
began installing structures they found in antique shops 
or unused theaters and hotels. The building is a part of 
the antiques collection that it houses; you can almost feel 
the haphazard, stitched-together quality of the walls.

Cavaliere developed his love for old objects as a 
kid visiting his grandparents on Eld Street in East Rock. 
They had bought their house, fully furnished, in the 
thirties. Cavaliere liked to play with the antique furniture 
and other paraphernalia stored in the loft of their back 
carriage house. 

After focusing on portraiture in college, Cavaliere 
turned to antique restoration. “I learn from things that 
have been around, things that are well made, that tell 
a story,” he explained.  After he found Lyric Hall—“it 
found me,” he insists—he moved his business to 
Westville and made restoring the building his raison d’être. 
Cavaliere and his assistants do restoration work in 
the studio, which is filled with scattered tools, containers 
with viscous adhesive liquids, and brushes of all sizes. In 
a corner sits an old parlor stove, a gray boom box, and 
a fragment of an old car wheel. A piece is missing from 
an enormous King George frame; he’s in the process of 
reconstructing it. 

He took me upstairs to a balcony that hangs over 
the back of the theater, which is adorned by a balustrade 
he’s had, in pieces, for years; he salvaged it from the 
deteriorating Hyperion Theater on Chapel Street. I didn’t 
need to see that Cavaliere sleeps there to understand: He 
is Lyric Hall.


We sat down in the kitchen. He painted me a 
picture: a night at Lyric Hall.  After the show finishes, 
everyone mingles in the reception room next to the 
theater, drinking white wine among ancient ships that 
hang in ornate frames. Cavaliere, in a thrift store tuxedo, 
is running around greeting and introducing, laughing and 
joking.  “When you get all these interesting people cheek 
by jowl,” Cavaliere told me, “there’s this wonderful spirit. 
This place has this universal appeal that’s so sacred.” At 
night, in the shadow of the dusted and revived, Lyric 
Hall sustains a community.  It’s a different kind of 
preservation.

But the hall was empty on a Sunday afternoon. 
Cavaliere woke up behind the Hyperion balustrade, 
theater empty and the floors creaky, to show me around. 
In the kitchen, a 1924 Glenwood stove was heating up 
a teakettle; Cavaliere took milk from the ancient GE 
fridge. A modern electric heater, probably from Home 
Depot, sat on the floor by the kitchen table; we laughed 
at how out of place it looked.  

As he began to eat his cereal, Cavaliere reflected on 
his new role as theater producer. His friends call him 
the “accidental impresario.” He broke off for a moment, 
looked at a wall. “Actors like working here,” he said. 
They tell him the place has good ghosts. 


**Title: Thumbin’ A Ride**
**Page number(s): 6**

This January, Alison Greenberg ‘13 was driving 
through rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania with a friend 
when she saw two men standing on the side of the road. 
One was tall with dreadlocks, the other smaller, unshaven, 
wearing baggy jeans, and eating peanut butter ravenously 
out of a jar. Greenberg and her friend kept driving, but 
knowing they’d be returning that way, Greenberg texted 
her friend Jesse Bradford ‘11 for advice. 

Bradford knew a thing or two about hitchhiking. 
The year after he graduated from Yale, he took a solo trip 
all the way around the continental United States, relying 
on strangers to get him from one point on the map to 
another. “Should we pick these guys up?” Greenberg 
asked Bradford. “Yeah!” he responded. “Don’t kill them, 
and don’t get killed.”

Greenberg erred on the side of caution in taking this 
tongue-in-cheek advice. Greenberg wanted her would-
be passengers to know she would not be messed with. 
She asked them their names and ages, and checked those 
against their IDs. She would drive them into Philadelphia, 
but had some questions for them first: Would they try to 
take anything from her? Hurt her or her friend? Trash 
her car? “No, ma’am,” they answered, again and again. 
Just in case, Greenberg told the hitchhikers–Tom and 
Beef–that her dad was a Philly cop and that he was on 
speed dial if they tried anything funny. They didn’t. 

In fact, Greenberg noted, Tom and Beef were 
exceptionally polite and grateful. They claimed it had 
been three weeks since someone had picked them up. In 
the meantime they’d been train hopping and walking and 
had the blisters on their feet to prove it. At a restaurant 
where Greenberg bought the hitchhikers burgers and 
milkshakes, Beef, who said he had ADHD and had 
(falsely, he claimed) been accused of rape, touched 
her knee. Greenberg felt extremely uncomfortable but 
shrugged it off: “I think he was just being sweet and had 
no bad intentions, whatsoever.” 

Enthusiasts like Bradford are quick to say that 
the stereotype of the dangerous hitchhiker is false. In 
Ginger Gail Strand’s book Killer on the Road: Violence 
and the American Interstate–which Bradford read while 
researching the history of hitchhiking–Strand claims 
that many Americans fear hitchhikers because of 
images spread by the F.B.I. and police. “The end result 
is that we have largely turned our backs on the obvious 
efficiencies—for our wallets as well as the planet—of 
ride-sharing,” wrote Strand in a New York Times editorial 
last November, advocating hitchhiking. “And we have 
lost a way to humanize the landscape of the road.”
