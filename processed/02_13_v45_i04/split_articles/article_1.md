The New Journal puts out a 
theme issue every spring. This year 
we’ve chosen “waste.” It’s a broad 
idea that produced many pieces 
exploring just the opposite of 
waste: subjects who care for and 
conserve the people and places 
around them. If the principle 
tenet of reporting is communicat­
ing stories and facts, then a tenet 
of engaged reporting should be to 
use these stories to point in posi­
tive directions. We hope you enjoy 
the issue.
