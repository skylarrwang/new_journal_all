By the time we had 
decided to birthday suit a 
swim in a small, dammed 
pool nearly in the basin of  
one of  the Stan’s valleys I 
had begun to feel as if  I 
was contracting, pulling 
out from my limbs.
along for the land. Neither of the girls had money to 
spare—Abby and I lived off a tight stipend. I’m not sure 
if they would have bought me food even had I asked. 
By the time we had decided to birthday suit a swim in 
a small, dammed pool nearly in the basin of one of the 
Stan’s valleys, I had begun to feel as if I was contracting, 
pulling out from my limbs and gathering in around my 
core. The pool lay a couple hundred feet above the valley 
floor. It was small—maybe twenty feet squared, and 
shallow. The water sat muddy and opaque. 

That night we dined on the 
shore of another small reservoir. 
A few stumps stood in the water, 
their caps clear of the lake. I 
perched on one, my feet drawn 
in and a brew in hand. For the 
next two days I would alternate 
between porter and stout. The 
first few times I had a Deschutes 
stout it was delightful—thick like 
a milkshake and bitter as collard 
greens. I felt its weight moving 
down me. I gripped the brown 
glass and wondered how badly the 
high water affected these woods. 
Below me, did roots soften and 
swell, split and lose the sense of 
their construction? The trees of 
the Sierras stand like the piers 
of a cathedral. Below them, the lake looked as odd as a 
warehouse floor in place of marble.

The valley we had hiked that day runs parallel to 
and north of both Yosemite Valley and her twin, Hetch 
Hetchy Valley. Since 1923, Hetch Hetchy’s three-mile-
long granite basin has lain below the Bay Area’s largest 
reservoir. Glacial valleys form in U-shapes, but this one, 
I realized atop my stump, must be sheered off.

The next day, we drove out of the Stanislaus, north. 
I watched the colors and rocks grow stronger, colder, 
and more severe as we ascended to the crest, which was 
still capped by snow in the middle of July. Down out 
of Sonora Pass, now in the desert, we passed through a 
gold rush ghost town. The old wooden houses were so 
thoroughly dried by the high winds that they looked like 
the dust that they lay upon. At the edge of the bowl in 
which the village sits stood a few elbows of rusted steel, 
bent like monumental skeletal arms. They must have 
been leaning over the hollow wells. It took me an hour 
to properly think about them. I seemed to be pulling 
deeper into some point below my chest.

That evening we drank again on the shores of a 
lake. Mono Lake is twice as salinic as any ocean, and 
it supports an ecosystem of just three organisms: 
algae, shrimp, and birds. The salt builds up in bulbous 
growths, constructing columns fifteen feet high in 
a weak, pasty grey. I looked out at the cold land and 
moved very little. My mind felt rather like those waters: 
still, accruing monstrous structures in its inactivity. My 
friends bought themselves dinner at the one restaurant 
in town. They were hungry, but I got a few fries. In the 
high altitude desert, temperatures were going to fall to 
just above freezing that night. We couldn’t sleep in the 
car. Abby ground up one of her 
blue ADHD pills, snipped about 
an inch and a half off her soda 
straw, and motioned how to 
snort the blue powder. So jazzed 
on her medication that we half-
decided to drive to Reno, Abby, 
Tess, and I followed some of the 
restaurant’s employees to a bar 
twenty miles away. In the very late 
hours of that night we walked 
a half-mile down a boardwalk 
over an enormous flat, grey 
and even wider, it seemed, than 
Mono Lake. I focused on moving 
forward. The boardwalk ended 
at a crater, which bubbled with 
sulphurous water. We stripped.

The hot water seemed to 
push at my flesh. I imagined my internal organs pressing 
together, my lungs straining from the pressure. I 
breathed light and fast. I felt like I was at the center of a 
balloon, ready to give. My fingers trembled and I slipped 
in the volcanic basin. I couldn’t feel the sides. 
Abby helped me rise and cool off in the desert. She 
pushed two of my fingers together and said “just shove 
them down.” But there was nothing to come up. 

On the return trip to the city the sky over the valley 
was thick and brown. I thought of the canyon and the 
lake and hot springs, and then I thought of the water. I 
would be ill for a few days. As I lay sweating on my cot 
the same murky thoughts washed through me. People 
lay waste to the land as they lay waste to themselves.
