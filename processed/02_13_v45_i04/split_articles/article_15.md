cuts to the TB budget allocated to each state. 

In the eternal fight for funding, TB lost a 
little ground because numbers of infection have been 
going down. What the people making the budget failed 
to realize is that these funding cuts will make cases like 
Ornagua’s not just more difficult to solve, but also more 
frequent. 

TB experts know all too well what happens when TB 
funding gets cut. The last time there were significant 
cuts was in the late eighties. TB numbers had taken a 
nosedive since the advent of drug therapy in the fifties, 
and with fewer and fewer cases of active TB, American 
public health officials believed they were well on their 
way to eradicating the disease. 

The CDC and other public health 
organizations, always pressed for 
funds, could shift some of their 
TB money to the prevention and 
control of other illnesses. 
Dr. 
Lloyd 
Friedman 
remembers that era well. His desk 
at the Milford Hospital Intensive 
Care Unit is covered in towers of 
articles and patients’ files, which 
are all linked to TB. One can’t 
help but think that his mind might 
look similar: endless reams of TB 
history waiting to be recalled with 
a scrunch of his chiseled face. 
In the late eighties, Friedman was fresh out of med-
school, doing medical screening at a welfare intake center 
in midtown Manhattan. “You go down this assembly 
line,” he said of his patients in his rapid-fire Brooklyn 
accent. “Get your ears tested, your eyes tested, your 
urine tested for drugs, blood drawn, EKG, skin-tests for 
TB, chest x-ray. We were seeing six to seven hundred 
people a day, and at least one case of TB among them.”
To Friedman, that number seemed higher than 
it should have been, and he became increasingly 
concerned that the US was heading into a TB epidemic. 
But the public health officials remained steadfast in their 
belief that TB would soon be a disease of the past, and 
Friedman’s warnings went unheeded. “I came out with 
an abstract describing the problem, and nobody would 
publish it,” Friedman said.
Friedman’s inklings turned out to be right. Looking 
at the data today, you can see a spike in TB numbers 
beginning in the late 1990s and peaking in 1992 and 1993. 
The spike was partially due to the AIDS epidemic, which 
allowed TB to piggyback on the virus’ destruction of 
immune systems, easily infecting people who otherwise 
might have warded the disease off. 
But for Friedman, funding cuts were at the heart 
of the TB epidemic of the 1990s. The cuts meant 
that there was not adequate care for these AIDS-TB 
patients, creating a deadly cycle of transmission. “The 
infrastructure to take care of TB just wasn’t there,” Dr. 
Friedman said. “As soon as the money goes away, then 
the rates go back up.” 
In 1993, the World Health Organization declared 
that there was an international TB crisis. American public 
health officials could no longer ignore the number of 
TB cases within their borders. DOT became a part of 
American public health policy to counter that epidemic. 
As the CDC allocated more TB money to public health 
departments, and as nurses like 
Maureen Bruce began to visit 
patients’ houses, the TB numbers 
began to fall again. By 1996, they 
were lower than they had ever 
been in the United States, and the 
trend has continued. 
But the CDC is now falling 
into the same sinkhole it did 
in the late eighties. Taking the 
success of DOT programs as 
a sign that the disease is on its 
way out, the CDC has made over 
a million dollars in cuts and has 
reorganized the funding so that 
states where TB control has been 
deemed effective are not eligible for as much money as 
they received in the past. 
Lynn Sosa, the deputy epidemiologist at the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health, is worried 
about the implications of these cuts. “There’s still a 
lot of work, and we feel we don’t have all the staff we 
need,” she said in a phone interview. “It means that TB 
patients will fall through the cracks and get more people 
infected. It’s a cycle.”
She sees that cycle progressing on a larger scale 
than just a few individual cases. “Our cases go down, 
we hit a point where they start cutting people, we don’t 
have the resources to maintain that low rate, and so our 
cases go up,” she said. “I see that happening in the next 
five years.”
Epidemiologists like Sosa are in the business of 
reading trends and speaking in statistics. But the problem 
with these funding cuts is not simply that they could 
spark another epidemic. They also fail to acknowledge 
that TB is still a problem for patients like Ornagua, and 
that the medical system is not doing enough to solve 
it. Some doctors have come to view the term “non-
Forcibly keeping her in

of action would cause 
the least harm.


compliance” as a form of medical name-calling. It pins 
the blame on the patient, leaving no room to question 
the orders the patient is obliged to follow. There is no 
doubt that contagion needs to be prevented, and in 
DOT public health officials have found a very effective 
way to prevent it. Given that the program’s strength lies 
in the way it can be personalized, it does not seem that 
hard to extend that personalization one step further, so 
that TB treatment helps patients unequivocally, without 
posing any threat to their jobs or their families. Yet to 
do that, the CDC would have to increase TB funding 
instead of cutting it. 

When she went back into the examining room 
to discuss the options with Ornagua, Cain 
understood that forcibly keeping Ornagua in the 
hospital would not only be traumatic, but also pose a 
public health risk. Ornagua’s distrust would only have 
deepened if she were made to stay at the hospital, and 
she would have passed that distrust along to her friends 
and family. In keeping Ornagua in the hospital, Cain 
would essentially have been discouraging other people 
in Ornagua’s community from getting tested for TB.
Ornagua was sitting against the wall, her eyes red 
from crying. “My friend told me not to get this skin-
test,” Ornagua said when she saw Cain. “She said, ‘If 
you get that skin-test and it’s positive, those doctors will 
make trouble for you.’ I did the test because I wanted to 
be a good citizen. Now look at the trouble I’m in.”
Ornagua’s regret was very real. Like her friend, she 
felt that having undiagnosed active TB would have been 
better than being forced into this treatment system which 
could potentially threaten her income and the well-being 
of her family. Despite her exemplary compliance when 
getting tested, in getting the results, and in coming to the 
Winchester, she saw the nurses and doctors at the clinic 
as people who were hurting her rather than making her 
better. 
Cain tried to imagine other solutions that would 
allow Ornagua to stay home without losing her job. 
She asked Ornagua if she had family or friends who 
could take her shifts at the office building. Ornagua 
said that she lives with her husband and sister, each of 
whom already works two jobs. They just didn’t have 
time to add other tasks to their list. But Cain pressed 
on: Perhaps they could take over for Ornagua, just until 
the TB medication took effect and she was no longer 
contagious? Wasn’t that better than being kept in the 
hospital or having the police show up? 
Framed that way, there was no question. Ornagua 
agreed. Her husband would find the time to clean the 
office building at night, and her sister would take over 
whatever household tasks that required leaving the 
house.  Ornagua would stay home and wait for the 
DOT nurse to give her the prescribed meds. Calmer 
now, Ornagua provided a sample of phlegm, and was 
allowed to leave. 
But the case still bothered Cain when I went to talk 
it over with her at her office a week later. She pointed 
out that the DOT system in place was very good at 
protecting the general public from TB, but that it could 
be tragically detrimental to the patient.
“In medicine, we have these multiple agendas,” said 
Cain. “We are fixing the physiology that’s wrong, but we 
have to fix it in the context of a patient’s life. Really, their 
family becomes our patient.” That was why she decided 
to send Ornagua home, hoping that she would keep her 
word and not go out. “I chose to believe her. But I’m 
still not sure that that was the right judgment.”
