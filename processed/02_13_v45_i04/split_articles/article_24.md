The New Journal
days we’ve seen this year. We’re sitting across a low 
table from each other, on worn leather loveseats; he’s 
wearing a dark blue vest, a lighter blue oxford, a bluish-
gray sweater, blue jeans, and brown shoes. All the blue 
complements his faded blue eyes, which smile a bit at 
the memory. 
“When they came out, they said, ‘Well we’ve let you 
through, but, you know, there were some really serious 
doubts,” he remembers. (In his quasi-memoir, Designs 
For Learning, Stearns phrases his conversation with the 
committee a tad differently: “We cannot tell from this 
document and this examination whether he is a fool or a 
genius. I suggest we take the risk and pass him.”)


As he relates this, he begins to fiddle with the pale 
floral coasters stacked on the table; at first, it seemed 
like an odd tic for someone generally so poised. His 
thumbnails, however, with their broad and craggy 
steppes, betray a nasty habit of nail-biting.


“I sent the introduction to the Quarterly Review of  
Biology,” Stearns continues. “George Williams, who was 
editor, published it. It became the most cited paper in 
life history evolution. Ever.” 
That first paper would catapult Stearns to 
international prominence. (The rest of his Ph.D. 
thesis—the more conventional part—would not be 
accepted for publication for another eight years.) Once 
an undergraduate at Yale, he is now one of the most 
accomplished evolutionary biologists in the world. Over 
the course of his long career—which isn’t over yet, 
not by a long shot—he’s trained and inspired an entire 
generation of biologists. He’s founded two journals, 
authored over one hundred papers, and written four 
books. According to Google Scholar, his papers have 
been cited 18,513 times.


Aside from scientific research, Stearns takes great 
pride in his teaching. When I asked him about his former 
students, he spoke for twelve full minutes, recalling each 
person’s achievements in detail. Stearns’s students have 
gone on to important positions in science, in disciplines 
that range from anthropology to ecology. If—as biology 
asserts—the point of life is to continue life, then, 
intellectually, Stearns hasn’t missed the mark. Nowadays, 
he’s got academic grandkids.


Stearns’s own life mirrors his research. As a budding 
biologist myself, I like to think of it in evolutionary 
terms: his influence is as inexorable as the law of natural 
selection. From his cyclical journey through Yale and 
back again, Stearns knows that life is best marked by 
its uneven steps, that the key moments in one’s own 
life history—juvenile development, finding a mate, age 
of first reproduction—occur in unexpected places and 
times. 


S
tearns’s own story begins in the northwest corner of 
the island of Hawai’i. He was born in December of 
1947, at the end of World War II, and grew up on a 
sugar plantation beneath the shade of Kohala Mountain, 
the oldest volcanic peak in the area. (Now, as a Yale 
professor, Stearns wears Hawai’ian shirts when the 
weather cooperates, a reminder of home.) 


He comes from a family of educators. His aunt 
Mary had helped the Chinese government set up 
primary schools in China. When she was kicked out 
by the Japanese invasion, she went back to Hawai’i and 
helped the Hawaiian state create its primary school 
system. His mother was a teacher in Oklahoma—she 
then moved to Hawai’i, and was a schoolteacher before 
she met Stearns’s father. 


Steve Stearns attended boarding school at Hawai’i 
Preparatory Academy (HPA)—they count our current 
president, Barack Obama, as one of their alumni—after 
fifth grade. HPA has a very good record of sending their 
students to top colleges on the mainland. Stearns was no 
exception, enrolling at Yale in 1963 at the tender age of 
16. (He skipped sixth grade.) 


Stearns grew up at Yale. His life as an undergraduate 
played out against the turbulent backdrop of the 
Vietnam War. The atmosphere on campus was incredibly 
patriotic, maybe even jingoistic, and Stearns had friends 
on campus who left to go to the front. “In ’68, it was

good to be against the war; in ’66 and ’67 it was not good, 
at Yale, to be against the war. Yale was conservative that 
way,” he explains to me.


Despite the climate, Steve was an early war protestor. 
The fallout drove him out of his society, St. Anthony’s 
Hall, and cost him nearly all of his friends during his 
final year. “I felt a great release when that happened,” he 
says. “And basically I threw myself into my academics, 
and I had a great semester academically. I really loved 
my courses.” 


Four years after matriculating at Yale, he received 
his bachelor’s degree in biology, graduating with honors 
as one of the top three students in biology. 


“I would say that the basic thing that happened to 
me at Yale was that, yes, I did get a good education in 
some things, but Yale made me into a snob. And that 
wasn’t good for me,” he says. “I don’t see Yale as an 
unmixed blessing by any means.”


Perhaps Stearns found the 
culture of Yale in the sixties 
stifling or overly intellectual. As a 
sixteen-year-old college student, 
he was much more sensitive to 
the striking effect Yale’s name 
often has for people outside its 
walls. 


Listening to Stearns talk 
about Yale reminds me of 
our own experience here, and 
raises a larger question: after 
four short years, what have we 
actually learned? This year, Stearns is my senior thesis 
advisor. In May, I’ll be graduating in Branford College, 
in the same courtyard where Stearns received his 
undergraduate diploma four and a half decades ago. 
I find it an odd parallel, representative of the cyclical 
nature of institutions. Forty-six years hence, will I be a 
Yale professor with a neatly trimmed white beard? (It’s 
not outside of the realm of possibility, but I don’t think 
I’m nearly professorial enough.) 


I don’t yet know how Yale will affect my life 
history—my future partner, family, and career—but, so 
far, my experiences have been almost uniformly positive. 
Stearns has been a large part of that. As a mentor, he’s 
not afraid to be brutally honest. “Get your fucking life 
together,” he told me at one of our meetings this year. 
I had fallen behind with research for my senior essay 
and spent most of my time on less academic activities 
instead of on reading papers.  He apologized later, at 
our next meeting, but I told him there was no need. 
I think he saw some of himself—perhaps one of the 
more desultory parts—in me, and reacted in a way that 
he thought would jolt me out of self-sabotage.


Stearns is aware of Yale’s insularity, and the danger 
that knowing everything (i.e., terminal narcissism) poses: 
“I’m especially sensitive to the capacity that Yale has to 
convince ambitious young people that they know what is 
best for the world. And I think they’re very dangerous.”


Immediately after he graduated from Yale in 1967, 
he won a prestigious fellowship from the National 
Science Foundation to get his Ph.D. in marine biology 
from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, 
California. He lasted a full six weeks before dropping 
out. He didn’t think the requirements were worth 
completing. 


“I was very aimless,” he said. “I traveled back and 
forth across the country—I actually drove, in my car, all 
the way across North America.” 


After his brief Kerouackian detour, Stearns moved 
back to Hawai’i and lived with his 
parents. He got a job at a medical 
clinic in Honolulu, helping to 
computerize its medical records. 
He was fired after three months 
because 
his 
behavior 
was 
apparently disturbing the nurses. 
“I think that I was young, insecure, 
arrogant, and made inappropriate 
comments,” he said. “So, that was 
a kick in the head.” 


It’s this arrogance, really, that 
defines Stearns. He’s convinced—
and always has been convinced—
that he’s right. I pressed him. 
“That was where I started to realize that Yale had 
damaged me and that I would have to change what I 
had become at Yale if I wanted to be on good relations 
with the people I worked with,” he said. “However, I still 
have scars, and I still try to avoid the sorts of experiences 
at Yale that damaged me.” He didn’t say what those 
experiences were.


That earlier arrogance, though, has mellowed over 
the years. Really, it’s become what it always was: relentless 
dedication to truth.


Life history evolution might say something worth 
noting, here—it’s explicitly concerned with marking 
life’s milestones, experiences that transition an organism 
into the next stages.


During the course of Stearns’s humbling non-
scientific wanderings, there was a bright spot: Steve 
met Beverly. A friend and fellow environmental activist, 
Tony Hodges, advised Steve to give her a call. On June 
19, 1970, the two went on a blind date to a Grateful 
Dead concert. They’ve been together ever since. 

“I think that I was young, 
insecure, arrogant, 
and made inappropriate 
comments,” he said. 
“So, that was

Meeting Bev gave Steve purpose, I think. He found 
an anchor at a time when he needed centering, when 
hopping between different jobs and locations wasn’t 
enough. Life history tactics—and romantic novels—
suggest that their meeting was a turning point in both 
of their lives. 


Another turning point: their first son, Justin, was 
born during the last nine months of Stearns’s Ph.D. 
research at UBC. Their second, Jason, was born two 
years later.


Jason is now a writer living in Africa; he’s an expert 
on the Congo, and his book Dancing in the Glory of  
Monsters explores the sensitive subject of the seemingly 
endless civil war. He’s just had a son (Stearns isn’t only 
an academic grandfather), and is busy ensuring that his 
life history will indeed evolve. Despite his full schedule, 
Jason found time to shoot me a short email about his 
dad. 


“In many ways he hasn’t changed much at all––he 
still comes home every afternoon before six, doesn’t 
work on Sundays, watches football with the sound off (he 
hates advertisements and doesn’t like the commentators 
much), beats us all at chess, and cooks a mean steak.” 


Now, I’ve never had a Stearns steak, but I can only 
assume they’re made with love. Stearns loves his work, 
but he’s always put his family first. He’s never worked 
nights or weekends, and has always been there for his 
boys. 


“I was home with my boys when they were growing 
up; we didn’t have a TV, we read to them at nights, I 
was with them for Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and all 
of that kind of stuff. And that’s irreplaceable,” he said. 
“Things happen to you when you get out of college that 
cut much closer to the bone of what life and death are 
all about.”


When Jason and Justin were 9 and 11, respectively, 
the family crossed the Atlantic, leaving their home in 
Portland and settling in Basel, Switzerland. 


The move was difficult for the family. His sons in 
particular did not acclimate to the new school system, 
struggling with learning in a different language. They 
had moved to the city because Steve had taken a new job 
there, and he felt guilty that they had trouble adjusting.


As he cooked dinner one night six months after 
they had arrived in Basel, Steve had a heart attack.


At the time, he didn’t know what had happened, 
and shrugged it off. But the next day, he couldn’t walk 
to work and was sent to the ER. He was hospitalized for 
three weeks. The doctors told him it was due to stress, 
which wasn’t surprising: in addition to the move, Steve’s 
father had recently died and Steve’s job required him to 
be able to lecture in German within two years. 


In Swiss culture, academia is highly regarded; 
professors are like tiny gods, with complete power 
over their domains. Naturally, this leads to god-sized 
expectations from subjects. Managing this academic 
pressure along with many others, Stearns was 
overwhelmed. His work was taking a toll on his health.


“While recovering from this near-death experience 
I realized that one of the reasons I was so stressed was 
that I was unconsciously responding to the expectations 
of my students and staff that I ought to fit their picture 
of a ‘Herr Professor Dr.’,” Stearns said. “I was not a 
Swiss professor; I was a kid from a sugar plantation in 
Hawaii.”


After 17 years of teaching at Basel, he left. In 
2000, the Stearns family moved back to Yale at Bev’s 
behest. Jason and Justin were both in college on the east 
coast—Jason was an undergrad at Amherst, while Justin 
was just starting grad school at Princeton—and Bev, a 
journalist, wanted to stay in one place long enough to 
hold a salaried position.


“I gave up my job in Switzerland, which was better 
than my job at Yale in many ways, to give her that last 
chance to have the reward of recognition in a career,” 
Stearns said. They miscalculated, however—the print 
industry was in freefall, and journalism jobs were scarce. 
“Within a year of our arrival, Jason was in the Congo 
and Justin was in Cairo, and Bev was not able to find the 
job she wanted. We made the best of it.” 


tearns rarely does original research anymore. 
Instead, he primarily teaches. For him, it’s a form of 
immediate gratification: The way a teacher affects his 
students is very quickly apparent.


Nowadays, he focuses on the burgeoning field of 
evolutionary medicine, the intersection of evolutionary 
biology and medical science. As a discipline, it promises 
new treatments and therapies for many different diseases. 
He teaches both a seminar course and a lecture course 
on the subject at Yale, and they’re perennially rated very 
highly on those all-important course evaluations. 


In many ways evolutionary medicine is a natural 
segue from life history evolution. If life history theory 
tells the stories of life, then evolutionary medicine uses 
these stories to inform centuries of medical science. 
The breadth of application is stunning, and potentially 
life-saving. For example, researchers have discovered a 
new method of treating autoimmune diseases—multiple 
sclerosis and Crohn’s disease, among others—using 
worms generally found in pigs. 


At Yale, Stearns’s methods of instilling the joy of 
discovery in his students have received university-wide 
praise. In 2011, he was awarded the DeVane prize for
