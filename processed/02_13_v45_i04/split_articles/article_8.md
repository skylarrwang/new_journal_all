Squeezed between Ivy Noodle and Tomatillo on 
Elm Street, Kathryn Redford’s apartment features less 
conventional cuisine than either restaurant. Redford, 
27, is the founder of Ofbug, a six-month-old start-up 
dedicated to the production and promotion of insects 
as animal feed. The bugs live in a few plastic IKEA 
boxes in the corner of her living room and die a few 
weeks later in her freezer, after which Redford dries and 
processes them into food.

“I really wanted to make a product that didn’t look 
like an insect and introduce it to the Western world,” 
Redford said. “We wouldn’t eat an insect if it looked like 
an insect. Nor would we eat a cow if it looked like a 
cow.”

Redford ate her first bug–a spider–in kindergarten. 
Another child who took pleasure in slaughtering spiders 
refused to stop killing them unless Redford ate one, so 
she did. Now she is working to develop insect-based 
animal feed, and eventually human food, and in the 
process has become part of an expanding network 
of individuals around the world who are working to 
incorporate bugs into the Western diet.

According to a website titled “Entomophagy”—
the scientific name for human consumption of bugs—
twenty-four restaurants in the United States list insects 
on their menus. Though none are listed in Connecticut, 
five such eateries are listed in New York, including two 
frozen yogurt shops. 

The idea of edible insects for the Western world 
has also caught the attention of the United Nations. 
A March 2012 United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) report developed an action plan to 
move the issue higher on the international agenda. The 
report estimates that eighty percent of humans around 
the world already include insects in their diets.

Afton Halloran, who works with the FAO Edible 
Insect Program, explained that producing breeding 
insects for animal feed is less energy-intensive than 
producing food crops. Bugs can be bred and mass-
produced in short periods of time, and they emit fewer 
greenhouse gases.

Redford and her husband, Paul Froese SOM ‘13, 
who studies at the Yale School of Management, share 
the apartment with the bugs, a pet hedgehog named 
Fangu, and various remnants of other animals: snakeskin 
and a coyote bone sit in glass vials on a side table next 
to a dried deer leg. When I visited the apartment in 
late January, only one of the bugs was alive. It moved 
lethargically across a bit of carrot that Redford had added 
to a glass of oatmeal. The bug was the sole survivor of 
a cannibalistic melee in which recently metamorphosed 
pupae had gone after one another.

Currently, Redford raises mealworms and crickets 
(an initial attempt to breed silkworms ended when a 
whiff of Paul’s cologne led to their untimely death). 
The mealworm beetles grow in three plastic boxes, 
each corresponding to one of three life stages: larvae, 
pupae, and beetle. The larvae, which we would recognize 
as mealworms, are what Redford uses for feed, letting 
some grow to beetles for breeding. An entire generation 
grows and dies over the course of three weeks. Next 
to the larvae sit two plastic boxes for the crickets, one 
specifically for breeding. 

When they’re ready, the mealworms and crickets go 
in the freezer. This allows them something like a natural 
death before Redford dries the bugs in a standard kitchen 
dehydrator and then, sometimes, pulverizes them in a 
coffee grounder. Freezing minimizes pain, she said. 
Even so, she paused before she put in her first batch.


“Oh my gosh, I’m going to kill thousands of 
lives right now,” she remembers thinking. “I don’t take 
pleasure in killing them or anything like that. I definitely 
have a conscience about it. My focus is on the greater 
goal here.” 

Gregory Sewitz, a senior at Brown, has a similar 
goal but different approach. He is also concerned about 
food security and nutrition, and is developing an insect-
based snack for human customers. 

“You have to create the market for eating crickets,” 
Sewitz said. “Protein bars are the best way in.” Sewitz 
plans to market a protein bar that hides the insect’s taste 
and texture, one that would look and taste like other 
major brands such as Cliff Bar and ProBar. 

While chickens may have no objection to eating 
bugs, humans, specifically those in Western culture, are 
a different story.

“A lot of the stigma has to do with the look of 
insects,” Halloran said. “We’re naturally inclined to either 
squish the insect or say, yuck, that’s gross.” But we’ve 
gotten used to eating strange animals before, she added. 
Shrimp and lobsters, which resemble insects, used to be 
low-expense foods for working people. Now both are 
luxury items.

“We’ve been eating our way around the true insect,” 
she said.

Even Redford experiences a visceral discomfort to 
eating certain kinds of bugs.

“I definitely–this is super hypocritical–I definitely 
don’t like legs and stuff like that on insects,” Redford 
said. “They’re twine-y, almost.”

She prefers mealworms, she said. “You can just pop 
them in your mouth when they’re dehydrated.” Scorpions 
and tarantulas are a no-go, but not because of the 
armored exoskeletons or hairy legs. 

“I love them too much,” Redford said.
