EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I first meet Al Vazquez on a snowy November evening 
at the police department’s headquarters. His dark 
brown skin is striking against his white button-down. The 
first lines of silver mark his hair and the thin mustache 
above his lips. He looks tired. The night before, he woke 
up just after midnight to a phone call informing him of 
a shooting and a baby’s accidental death. He rests his 
hand on his holster as we ride the elevator to his third-
floor office. Most of the other cubicles are empty, but 
the phones continue ringing nonstop.

Vazquez has been nervously awaiting the verdict 
in the trial of Troy Jackson for the 2007 murder of 
Julian Ellis. With community policing restored under 
Esserman, the department is aiming for a personal 
connection with the community. After five years of 
negotiation, Vazquez had convinced a woman to step 
forward as a key witness for the Jackson trial, even 
though she was deeply concerned 
about retaliation. When I first met 
Vazquez, he was on the phone with 
her, reassuring her and offering 
to meet at the courthouse before 
she was set to testify the next 
morning. His two other witnesses 
are less upstanding citizens: both 
are currently incarcerated. One, 
who is doing time for drug-
related charges, “went south” last 
week, and now denies his earlier 
testimony, presumably after being 
threatened by Jackson’s gang while 
in prison. He recanted his 2010 
statement where he identified Jackson as Julian’s killer. 
“The detective”—Vazquez—“told me what to say.” “He 
gave you all the details?” the state’s prosecutor asked. 
“Yes.”

In November 2011, Esserman, who had served as 
deputy police chief when Vazquez joined the force but 
most recently worked as Chief of Police in Providence, 
R.I, was called back to New Haven. As the fourth chief 
in three and a half years, Esserman had his work cut out 
for him. The department had gained a reputation for 
brutality and corruption, an enemy to the community 
it was supposed to protect and serve. The number of 
homicides was skyrocketing, tying the record for the 
most murders in one year. By the end of 2011, thirty-four 
had been murdered, and 122 had been shot. And after 
years of attrition and poor management, the department 
was severely understaffed. Frank Cochran, the current 
chair of the Civilian Review Board, said the department 
has had trouble recruiting officers from New Haven, a 
legacy of its former resistance to collaborating with the 
community. Vazquez currently has only thirty-eight of 
the sixty-one detectives that are supposed to fill his unit. 
In overseeing the division, he is doing the work of a 
lieutenant, but due to gaps in the department hierarchy, 
he remains at the lower rank of sergeant.

With community policing and Project Longevity, 
Esserman is applying strategies he used to reduce crime 
when he was chief in Providence, focusing on the small 
groups responsible for most of the city’s gun violence, 
rather than targeting everyone in certain neighborhoods 
as potential lawbreakers. “I am not bringing a new 
message or style to New Haven. I am bringing back the 
old New Haven policing.” Esserman told me. When 
he was deputy chief in New Haven, Esserman had 
created Connecticut’s first gang task force in the hopes 
of negotiating with rival gang leaders to end conflicts 
before their arguments became deadly. “We were one 
of the centers of American 
progressive policing,” Esserman 
says. 

As one of many changes 
to the department’s leadership, 
Esserman promoted Vazquez 
to head the department’s Major 
Crimes Unit in April 2011, 
giving him responsibility for 
supervising the investigation of 
all homicides and shootings that 
occur in the Elm City. “He is one 
of the best detectives I have ever 
met,” Esserman told me. “If I, 
God forbid, ever had a family 
member who was a victim of a crime, I would want Sgt. 
Vazquez on the case. I know he would bring justice to 
my family.”

Vazquez had often criticized the strategies former 
chiefs implemented to fight against gangs, but they 
refused to listen to his suggestions. Yet he and a few 
others like Assistant Chief Luiz Casanova, who Vazquez 
trained seventeen years ago, never stopped practicing 
Esserman’s strategies. “Community policing is the only 
way to do policing,” Vazquez says. ““There is a mentality 
that police work is just responding to calls. But there is 
more than that.” Vazquez has been more than happy to 
oversee the implementation of community policing in 
his unit. So far, it has been working: Last year, shootings 
and homicides fell by nearly half. This year, there have 
been five non-fatal shootings, while by the time in 2012, 
there had been eleven.

Yet the city’s gangs have not entirely disappeared. 
Yale University researchers working with the police have 


“We are not exchanging 
hugs for handcuffs. We are 
doing both,” Esserman 
told me. “We are building 
relationships on both sides 
of  that badge.

identified nineteen active gangs with nearly six hundred 
members, some of whom have already been incarcerated 
in recent sweeps. As the police department’s structure 
changes, the gangs also adapt, moving their operations 
underground. They no longer perform drug deals on 
street corners as they did in the 1990s, but instead tell 
customers to call a middleman who will set up a deal. 
Their technology is more sophisticated. They have 
heavier firepower and clever new ways of storing drugs 
in cars’ hidden compartments.

Still, Esserman’s community policing model has been 
working so far. In January, after days of deliberation—
usually a bad sign, Vazquez feared—the jury in Troy 
Jackson’s murder case returned a guilty verdict. Jackson 
raised his chin to the ceiling, as if readying for a noose, 
while the jury forewoman read him his crime: guilty of 
murder in the shooting of Julian Ellis. Another juror 
cried softly. In mid-February, Vazquez listened intently 
as the judge read Jackson his sentence of sixty years in 
prison.

Vazquez’s changed perceptions of the gang 
members are epitomized in Project Longevity, 
where community policing is taken to its logical end. 
It communicates directly with gang members, treating 
them as equal members of the community, where before 
they had been the enemy, terrorists, outsiders in their 
own neighborhoods.

At the end of last November, U.S. Attorney 
General Eric Holder, Gov. Dannel Malloy, and Sen. 
Richard Blumenthal gathered with local leaders in the 
tallest building in New Haven, the Connecticut Financial 
Center, to announce the start of Project Longevity. The 
comprehensive plan combined aid from social service 
providers — the carrot — with the punitive force of 
police, prosecutors, and the U.S. Attorney General — 
the stick. Similar programs have successfully reduced 
gun violence in neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and 
Cincinnati, the project’s backers say.

“Project Longevity will send a powerful message to 
those who would commit violent crimes targeting their 
fellow citizens that such acts will not be tolerated and 
that help is available for all those who wish to break the 
cycle of violence and gang activity,” Holder said from 
the podium. 

A key tactic for Project Longevity is the “call-in,” a 
sit-down meeting between gang members, social service 
providers, and law enforcement. On a Monday evening in 
November, the Hall of Records was likely the safest and 
most dangerous place in the city as twenty-five members
