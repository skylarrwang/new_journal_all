“S
tearns, this is bad philosophy and it’s bad 
science. Defend yourself.” 
It’s the early 1970s, in a small classroom 
at the University of British Columbia. Halfway around 
the world, the Vietnam War rages on. In our quiet corner 
of Canada, however, there’s nothing but the sound of 
agitated footsteps as Stephen Stearns ’67 paces, waiting 
to know whether his outrageous Ph.D. proposal will be 
accepted. The topic is the main problem: Essentially, 
what Stearns has written proposes the formalization 
of a completely new area of evolutionary biology—life 
history evolution.


If the committee decides against him, his career as a 
scientist is finished before it’s even really begun.


L
ife history evolution theory defines the stages of 
organisms’ lives and aims to explain why they invest 
different amounts of time and energy in development, 
fertility and death. Organisms allocate limited resources 
intelligently—energy used for foraging, for example, 
may decrease the amount available for reproduction. 
Researchers study traits including age of maturity, 
age at first reproduction, number of offspring per birth, 
and duration of juvenile development. Natural selection, 
the theory says, ultimately works to ensure the largest 
possible number of surviving offspring.


In a sentence, life history theory is the realm of 
biology that tells the story of life itself. 
Currently the Edward P. Bass Professor of Ecology 
and Evolutionary Biology at Yale, Stearns has made 
some of the most significant contributions to the field. 
Just last year, he and his collaborators found evidence 
that humans are still evolving. They analyzed existing 
data from a long-term study and concluded that women 
are evolving to “be on average slightly shorter and 
stouter, to have lower total cholesterol levels and systolic 
blood pressure, to have their first child earlier, and to 
reach menopause later than they would in the absence 
of evolution.” In other words, they found that selection 
is making sure we have more opportunities to reproduce.


“I walked up and down in the hall for forty-five 
minutes while they talked,” Stearns says, referencing his 
extended wait while the Ph.D. committee made their 
final decision. “The usual time was five to ten minutes.”
