in the US have refused to come in to their appointments 
or to take medication. For decades now, physicians and 
public health officials have viewed non-compliance as 
the single biggest roadblock in treating this country’s TB 
problem.


Once known as wasting disease, or consumption, 
TB is an infectious disease that has plagued humans 
since the Neolithic era. The disease is transmitted by 
the microscopic beads of liquid we release into the air 
when we cough, sneeze, talk, or laugh. If someone walks 
around with untreated TB, they are likely to spread it 
around their community. This sounds bad enough, but 
it gets worse: If the person has 
begun treatment and allowed it 
to lapse, the disease will have 
had the opportunity to become 
resistant to the drugs prescribed. 
The beads of liquid the person 
emits with each cough or “How 
are you?” then carry a strain of 
TB that the standard regimen of 
drugs cannot cure. Patients who 
don’t take their medication could 
be creating ever-more-invincible 
strains of TB. 
This threat can feel very 
remote. Most of us think of 
TB as a disease conquered by 
antibiotics, an affliction of our 
forebears and of the Third World. 
We cannot imagine anyone in 
our city wasting away because of 
lungs infected with tuberculosis 
bacteria. Yet people all over the US—people like Mariana 
Ornagua—suffer from TB, and their non-compliance 
could have very serious consequences. 
The prospect of a TB epidemic is so scary that 
since the 1990s, the United States has implemented 
a treatment program that squelches any possibility 
of non-compliance. It is called Directly Observed 
Therapy (DOT), and it involves a public health nurse 
meeting up with patients every day to make sure they 
are taking their medication. This lasts between six and 
nine months, and patients have no choice in the matter: 
If they have contagious TB, the law requires them to 
fulfill their treatment. “The nurse doesn’t just ask 
them if they took the pill,” says Dr. Lloyd Friedman, a 
Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at Yale. “She watches 
them take it, and she watches them swallow it. They can 
refuse treatment, but we’ll put ‘em in jail. We’re pretty 
aggressive: If they disappear, we find them.”
The aggressiveness of DOT has brought TB to 
its knees in the United States. The number of people 
infected with active TB is the lowest it has ever been—in 
2011, there were just over 10, 500 reported cases in the 
US, less than a tenth of what it was in 1953 and less than 
half of what it was in 1991. Doctors and public health 
officials credit DOT with those happy statistics.


While DOT may be a public triumph, it can also 
produce private tragedies. With it, doctors and public 
health officials are trying to solve the problem of patients 
disregarding their doctor’s orders. But sometimes the 
doctor’s orders don’t take the patient’s whole situation 
into account. The word “non-compliance” brings to 
mind a hardheaded refusal on the 
patient’s part. Yet more often than 
not, the DOT regimen demands 
a debilitating commitment from 
the patient without providing the 
support that would make such a 
commitment feasible. And as TB 
funding gets cut, public health 
departments have fewer avenues 
to tailor treatment to the patient’s 
needs. 

As 
Ornagua 
waited 
on 
November 30th, Dr. Hilary 
Cain pulled up her chest X-ray 
on a computer in the clinic’s 
conference room. Ornagua’s ribs 
were a series of graceful arcs, 
broken only by the white ghost 
of her heart. But what Cain was 
interested in was an area at the 
top of her right lung.
“An easy sign that things are normal is symmetry, 
and we have asymmetry here,” Cain said, pointing to a 
white lump near Ornagua’s collarbone. It had a pinprick 
of pitch black near its center, which Cain identified as a 
possible cavity created by TB. “If I were looking at this 
in a seventy-year-old smoker, I would say she had lung 
cancer. But in a thirty-two-year-old who doesn’t smoke? 
It certainly raises the suspicion of TB.” 
Before Cain headed into the examining room, Ming 
Lai, the nurse who runs the Winchester’s TB program, 
handed her a turquoise mask like the one Ornagua was 
wearing. These masks—N95—are supposed to block 
out everything larger than 0.3 microns if used properly. 
“The misuse of these N95 respirators may result in 
serious injury or even death,” reads a warning in fine-
print on advertisements for N95.
Cain pulled both straps behind her ears, and molded 
the metal bar to the shape of her nose. “If you can’t 
breathe, you’re wearing it right,” Lai said wryly. This 
small patch of green fabric was all that would protect 
Cain from Ornagua’s germs.


But when she got into the examining room, she 
found that Ornagua herself had not properly put on her 
mask. It was upside down, with one of the straps hanging 
uselessly down her neck and the metal bar resting loosely 
against her chin.  Not wanting to embarrass her patient, 
Cain made no mention of the misuse. “I am Dr. Cain,” 
she said, taking Ornagua’s hand before sitting down 
beside her.
Cain is a tall woman with a quivery voice. Her 
manner is gentle but firm, finely tuned to putting patients 
at ease. This is particularly important when dealing with 
TB patients because of their frequent distrust of the 
medical system. “There is a stigma attached to TB,” she 
told me before she slipped into the examining room. 
“It’s important that the patient knows we’re here to 
support and not to criticize her.” 
Cain felt immediately that Ornagua was a patient 
she could trust. Ornagua was good-natured and polite, 
answering Cain’s questions as best as she could through 
a Spanish-speaking interpreter in the examining room. 
Her hands lay folded on her jacket and purse, which 
were piled in her lap, and she calmly maintained Cain’s 
eye-contact. Every so often, she jiggled her pink and 
white Sketchers, betraying her nervousness, but mostly 
she sat still. 
Cain’s confidence in Ornagua was bolstered even 
further when she heard about Ornagua’s responsibilities. 
Every morning, she got her twelve-year-old son ready 
for school before walking him to the bus-stop. She 
spent the rest of the day balancing domestic duties for 
her family with English classes at New Haven Adult Ed. 
Then, at night, she worked as a cleaning lady in an office 
building. 
Ornagua was not displaying any external TB 
symptoms: She wasn’t coughing, losing weight, getting 
fevers, or being kept up at night by chills and abundant 
sweat. But the lump in Ornagua’s chest was worrisome 
enough for Cain to treat her for active tuberculosis. 
“I’m still concerned that you have active TB, and 
so I’m going to start you on medication,” said Dr. Cain. 
Ornagua nodded. The fact that her lungs were 
infected with a deadly contagious disease didn’t seem to 
scare her much. 
“You’re going to have to stay at home for next two 
weeks. Is that ok?”
This was the first time that Ornagua’s composure 
began to crack, her eyes flicking from Cain to the 
interpreter and back again. “I am in school and I need to 
finish the semester.” Ornagua’s voice was plaintive, but 
the interpreter’s tone stayed even. His expression never 
wavered from its baseline of discreet concern. He kept 
his hands folded demurely in front of him. 
“I’ll give you a note so you don’t have to go to 
school,” said Cain, touching Ornagua’s arm and looking 
her in the eye. “You need to stay at home. It’s very 
important. And when I say stay at home, I mean don’t go 
out at all. No shopping, no laundry. You have to stay in 
your house. We are going to have a nurse come to your 
house every day to bring you your medication. We do 
this for everyone who has TB. It’s not that we don’t trust 
you—these are health department regulations.”
“Ok,” said Ornagua tentatively. 
Cain left to begin filling out a prescription. “She 
seems responsible,” she said to Lai as they passed in the 
hallway. “I think she should come back in a month.” 
Ornagua didn’t drink, use drugs, or live on the street. She 
hardly fit the profile of a non-compliant tuberculosis 
patient. 

But when Lai went into the examining room to 
collect a sample of phlegm for testing, Ornagua said, “I 
can’t honestly tell you that I’m going to stay home.” 

Lai came out to tell Cain, who rushed back into 
the room. She told Ornagua that she would have to be 
admitted to the hospital if she couldn’t stay at home, and 
Ornagua began to cry. 

“You don’t understand,” she told Cain through 
her tears. “I’m going to lose my job. I have to pay the 
rent.” 
When Cain mentioned the possibility of summoning 
a police officer, Mariana became even more upset. She 
had come to New Haven from Ecuador seven years ago. 
Whether or not she had legal status as an immigrant, 
it could be disastrous for her family if a police officer 
showed up at their door. 

Cain and Lai didn’t know what to do. They 
left the examining room and stood huddled in the white 
hallway of the Winchester, discussing their options. 
They couldn’t send her home if they thought she would 
be exposing her community to TB—it would be both 
illegal and unethical. After all, their first duty was to 
make sure that Ornagua didn’t spread the disease. 
But they didn’t want to call the police on her either, 
as they would be endangering the life she’d built in 
Connecticut over the last seven years. Forcibly keeping 
her in the hospital wasn’t much more appealing. Ornagua 
was their patient. Her well-being was their responsibility. 
They were here to help her. But neither of them could 
figure out which course of action would cause the least 
harm. 


The dilemma that Cain and Lai faced was exactly 
the kind of situation that DOT was supposed to 
solve. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) allocates a budget to each state’s public health 
department to cover TB care and meds. The program 
is designed to preclude a TB epidemic by providing the 
patient with free, humane, personalized treatment. For 
many patients, DOT has been just that. 
If there is anyone who knows about the success of 
DOT in New Haven, it’s Maureen Bruce. Bruce has the 
build of a linebacker, and although her eyes are warm, 
they have a bloodhound’s intensity. From the early 1990s 
until 2009, Bruce was the public health nurse responsible 
for DOT in the city of New Haven. 
Despite her dogged 
personality, 
Bruce 
was, 
to most of her patients, 
like a member of the 
family. Often she would 
go meet her patients at the 
Winchester Chest Clinic 
just 
after 
they’d 
been 
diagnosed with active TB. 
Unless Maureen and her 
colleagues were sure that 
the patients were no longer 
contagious, they would not 
let them leave the hospital. 
(The verdict has changed 
since then: Doctors now 
feel that there is less risk 
of contagion if patients go 
home and stay there, given 
that the people they live 
with have probably already 
been exposed to the disease, 
which is not the case for everyone who comes to the 
hospital.)
Bruce used that first meeting at the Winchester to 
determine how she could find her patients once they 
were released, so that she could make sure they were 
taking their meds. For some that meant visiting their 
house, coming into the living-room. For others, she 
drove to the door of the factory where they worked, and 
they would come out, sit in the front seat of her car, and 
take the pills she gave them. For her homeless patients, 
she would meet them on a street corner or in one of 
New Haven’s shelters; often she would get the shelter to 
bend its rules so that the patient could stay and wait for 
her there after the other sleepers had been kicked out at 
seven AM. 
But her devotion went far beyond meeting up with 
her patients at their preferred spots. She would drive 
them to their doctor’s appointments, take them out for 
coffee and a Danish, bring them groceries, or take care 
of their kids. “I had one man who was homeless,” she 
recalled, “and as long as I had clean socks for him, he 
would go to his doctor’s appointment. I would go to 
BJs, and I would buy bags of socks and keep them in my 
trunk. As long as I had a pair of clean white socks, he 
would get in my car.” Bruce lent another patient enough 
money for her to make the down-payment on a car.
Bruce is not handing out socks anymore. In 2009, 
her position got cut down to just nineteen hours a week, 
and she had to move to another position at the public 
health department to keep working full-time. 
If the position of 
DOT nurse for New Haven 
were still a full-time job, at 
least Lai and Cain could 
have relied on someone 
other than the police to 
check that Ornagua was 
staying at home. But Bruce’s 
replacement only works 
half-days.
And yet, at its root, 
the problem is not one of 
enforcement. Rather, public health officials need to 
make DOT a program that a patient is able to comply 
with freely. If a doctor asks a patient to stay home, that 
means compensating for the patient’s lost salary.
For most Americans, the idea that the state of 
Connecticut pays for Ornagua’s TB meds and care 
is already impressive enough. But there was a time, 
when Bruce was still working as a TB nurse, that the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health would pay 
patients’ rents when they weren’t allowed to go to work. 
That means that they were able to get treatment for TB 
without risking eviction. 
These cuts—of the budget to supplement a patient’s 
rent, of the DOT nurse’s hours—turned out to herald a 
larger trend. This year, the CDC announced even further
