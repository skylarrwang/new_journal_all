EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The night of Friday, June 17, 2006, was beautiful 
and warm as detective Al Vazquez and his 
partner drove through New Haven. The day’s 
work had been quiet, until they got a call over the radio, 
a disembodied voice saying a shooting had occurred in 
the Dwight neighborhood west of downtown. When he 
arrived at the scene, Vazquez was shocked to find EMTs 
wheeling a little black girl on a gurney. He watched as a 
paramedic hunched over her, vigorously pumping her 
chest. Vazquez didn’t need his decade of experience 
to know she was nearing death. Her name was Jajuana 
Cole. She was 13. 

Around 11 p.m., Jajuana had been standing with 
Krystal Hammet, 13, outside of a party where they 
had some older friends. Three teenagers from the ‘Ville 
gang—a group modeled after Los Angeles’ Crips—
drove down the street and noticed a member of a rival 
gang near the girls. Daniel Carter, 18, who was carrying 
a chrome handgun as he drove by, allegedly said, “There 
go some of them.” The boys parked on an adjacent 
block and took a shortcut through an alley. Tremayne 
Sanders, 16, had a black handgun, and Lamont Swint, 
17, had a video camera. 

Vazquez says the film Lamont shot is almost entirely 
black, with only pixelated silhouettes and muffled voices. 
Through the darkness, Krystal screams first: “Please 
don’t shoot!” The muzzle of a gun flashes about a dozen 
times. Then, Jajuana’s voice: “Oh my God, no!” The 
camera lowers to the ground as the boys run back to 
their getaway car. Carter mumbles, “I think I shot a girl.” 
The recording stops.

Krystal, whose back and leg had been grazed by 
bullets, dragged her friend to the second-floor landing 
of an apartment building. She cradled her friend while 
Jajuana pleaded, “Don’t let me die, don’t let me die.” 
Blood stained the floor. Paramedics arrived within 
minutes to take Jajuana to Yale-New Haven Hospital. 
Krystal begged to go to the same hospital, but the 
EMTs refused. Vazquez reached the scene as the girls 
were loaded into separate ambulances. The sight of the 
injured young girls reminded him of his own daughter. 
Anyone watching Vazquez that night could not have 
known the shock and sadness and anger that lurked in 
his gut. He went about his work methodically: he asked 
the officers if there had been witnesses, and from the 
growing crowd, found a girl who had seen the incident 
and had been hit with shrapnel. Vasquez then called 
for another ambulance, and instructed an officer to 
stay with her. When he retells the story, his voice grows 
louder: “Do not leave her side,” he told the cop. “No 
one else talks with her. Stay with her.” 

Jajuana died early the next morning. Her mother 
did not have the $795 to pay for a tombstone to mark 
her grave at Evergreen Cemetery. Vazquez broke his 
one rule he had never broken before: He promised the 
mother he would bring the murderers to justice. He 
interviewed the targeted gang member, informants, and 
eyewitnesses, and within thirty-six sleepless hours, he 
had arrested four teenagers, who all either confessed or 
informed on each other. Carter, who fired the fatal shot, 
is serving a forty-year sentence in prison. 

Six years later, in November 2012, Vazquez broke 
his rule against making promises for the second time 
in his career. Participating in Project Longevity, a new 
initiative to prevent gang violence, Vazquez promised 
gang members that if they killed one more person, 
each would be punished to the fullest extent of the 
law, pursued by the combined forces of local, state, 
and federal authorities. Vazquez’s thinking has changed 
considerably since his early days on the police force. 
Where he once saw gang members as an evil force to be 
locked away, he now sees them as a group of misguided 
teenagers who lost their way, paying for mistakes with 
their lives.

Project Longevity is the latest initiative in the 
New Haven Police Department’s effort to improve 
its engagement with the community. Since returning 
to New Haven in 2011, Chief Dean Esserman has 
reinstated community policing, a model of partnership 
with community members Esserman helped craft as 
deputy chief in the early 1990s. Like many of Esserman’s 
recent projects, Project Longevity is not just punitive: 
It offers gang members the social services they might 
need to escape from a life of crime. Like Vazquez, the 
police department’s leadership now realizes that merely 
incarcerating gang members will not stop the violence, 
and they hope that these young men will take the escape 
route offered. But Vazquez knows he will have to follow 
through with a crackdown if shootings continue. If he 
does not, senseless deaths like Jajuana’s will continue to 
occur.

“Those images never escape you,” Vazquez says, 
as he remembers Jajuana’s little body on the gurney. He 
blinks, as if to push back tears from shining eyes.


Vazquez could easily have been one of the 
shooters—or maybe the target—that night in June.

But from a young age, he avoided life in a gang, rejecting 
any of the attractions that the life might have offered, in 
order to pursue his dream of becoming a police officer. 
Born in Middletown, Conn., in 1968, he spent his 
childhood shuttling back and forth between Puerto Rico 
and New England. Unable to support him financially, 
his parents sent their two-year-old son to live with an 
aunt in Puerto Rico. After four years he returned to 
Middletown, but his mother and father fought often. 
They separated when Vazquez was ten years old, and he 
travelled back to Puerto Rico.

“I always wanted to be a cop,” Vazquez tells me. He 
fantasized about catching the “bad guys,” accelerating a 
police car with lights flashing and sirens shrieking. Either 
in spite of or because of his chaotic childhood, Vazquez 
saw the world in absolute terms of good and evil, and he 
dedicated his life to being on the 
right side of the divide.

From the moment he entered 
middle school in Puerto Rico, 
Vazquez was pressured to join a 
gang. He desperately needed the 
money the lifestyle could provide, 
but he resisted their advances 
and was severely and constantly 
beaten for it. Instead, he took a 
job in construction during school 
vacations. Houses in Puerto 
Rico were built anywhere space 
was available, sometimes even 
on the edge of a cliff, so almost 
all the construction had to be 
done manually. As a 12-year-
old, Vazquez carried 50-pound 
buckets of cement up a ladder to lay as the roof. The 
labor was exhausting, but Vazquez was satisfied that he 
made his money honestly. His classmates, who viewed 
him as an outsider, referred to him as the “gringo.” 

In 1985, Vazquez moved to New Haven, where 
he has lived ever since. Neither of his parents could 
afford to take him in, so he was forced into a foster 
home. He enrolled in Wilbur Cross High School, 
where gang members again tried to lure him into their 
lifestyle. They told him he had to sell drugs for them 
in the projects near Ashmun and Webster, which have 
since been demolished and are now the site of the Yale 
Police Department headquarters. Once, when Vazquez 
refused to participate, a gang member pulled a knife 
on him. Rather than back down, Vazquez prepared to 
fight him with his bare hands. Luckily, an older gang 
member intervened, telling the youngster, “Don’t touch 
him. Leave him alone.” Vazquez was so adamant in his 
rebuffs that gangs eventually stopped trying to persuade 
him.

Role models were rare in New Haven’s foster 
homes and projects. Today, Vazquez says he wishes 
the department had implemented community policing 
when he was young. He wishes there had been a local 
cop, with whom he could have shared his difficulties, 
someone he could have emulated. I ask Vazquez why he 
was never tempted by the security and money joining a 
gang could offer. He thinks for a moment. “I really don’t 
know. I guided myself through. Sometimes answers are 
simplistic.”

Vazquez worked multiple part-time jobs to support 
himself, first as an attendant at a Mobil gas station and 
later as a mechanic at a Mercedes-Benz dealership. When 
he turned twenty-one, he applied to be a police officer. 
He was the first in his family to 
enter a career in law enforcement. 
He passed the written, physical, 
and oral exams, and with thirty-
two others, all raised in New 
Haven, Vazquez was sworn in as a 
police officer on January 21, 1992.

His 
first 
patrol 
sent 
him on a walking beat in the 
Dwight-Kensington district, the 
neighborhood where he would 
one day investigate Jajuana’s 
murder. Esserman’s community 
policing put cops on foot or 
bicycle on beats around the 
city instead of in patrol cars to 
descend on crime hot spots. 
“We are not exchanging hugs for 
handcuffs. We are doing both,” Esserman told me. “We 
are building relationships on both sides of that badge.” 
When he first pioneered the model between 1990 and 
1997, crime in New Haven fell by forty-one percent, 
compared to a ten percent drop in crime nationally. 
Abandoned houses lined the blocks of Vazquez’s 
beat, providing hideouts for gangs and places to stash 
drugs and guns. Two groups dominated the area: the 
Kensington Street Internationals and the Ghostbusters. 
Corny as their names were, the gangs were ferociously 
dangerous. Once, Vazquez and a partner were walking 
their beat when shooting broke out at an intersection 
and the pair was caught in the crossfire. They could 
not see any shooters, and the echo of shots bouncing 
between the houses prevented them from locating the 
bullets’ origin. Vazquez ducked behind a car and called 
for backup, but all he could do was wait for the gangs’ 
ammunition to run out.


Using one of his favorite and oft-repeated phrases, 
Vazquez says he was “full of piss and vinegar” in those 
early years as an officer. After witnessing violence during 
high school, he was eager to clean up the streets of New 
Haven. At the time, he thought that meant “running 
after the drug dealers, the gangbangers, and the shooters, 
locking them up, seizing the guns and the drugs, and 
putting them behind bars.” Though he would later 
realize the situation on the streets was far more complex 
than that, Vazquez spent his rookie days thinking he was 
a soldier in an enduring battle against evil. Discord had 
broken his family, but Vazquez would not let lawlessness 
do the same to his city. He fought back this time, fiercely, 
as he assailed gangs with one arrest after another.

After a few years of walking a beat, Vazquez was 
recruited back to headquarters in 1996 for a 
temporary assignment to the detective bureau, the 
unit he would later oversee. Patrol officers routinely 
worked stints as investigators to get a taste of detective 
work, but also so the detectives, who Vazquez calls the 
“old-timers,” could have a connection to informants 
on the street. Vazquez was initially hesitant about his 
placement, thinking he would hate the work. Detective 
work is much slower-paced than a cop’s. After going 
from a uniform to a suit, you have to work methodically, 
thinking constantly about your next move rather than 
reacting to whatever the street throws at you.

“There you have it: the dead body. Figure it out,” 
he tells me. Sometimes you have eyewitnesses and 
sometimes you have nothing. On one chilly January night 
when temperatures sank into the negatives, Vazquez 
found a body in a parking lot with a gunshot wound to 
the head. Years later, the case is still cold. Other times, 
as with Jajuana’s homicide, you have eyewitnesses and 
suspects immediately, and the case can be closed in 
hours.

At the end of his three months, Vazquez had solved 
twelve of the sixteen cases he had been assigned. His 
new boss wanted him to stay on as a detective, but his 
union contract forced him back to a beat. Eventually, a 
compromise was reached and Vazquez joined the drug 
enforcement task force.

Vazquez says his first days as a detective gave him 
a new worldview. Although he did encounter cases like 
Jajuana’s, in which crime destroyed the life of an innocent 
person, the situation was often morally complex. Many 
of the homicides resulted from gunfights between gang 
members: chance alone determined who was the victim 
and who was the murderer. In some cases, the victim 
was a murderer himself. The categories of good and 
evil that he had sorted the world into suddenly seemed 
overly romantic. It was often kids he was chasing down, 
young men who had fallen into gangs because the city 
offered them no alternative. “You realize it’s a different 
game,” he says now. “Nothing is that easy, that simple, 
that straightforward.” Though his investigations into 
crimes like child abuse deepened his awareness of how 
cruel people can be, Vazquez changed his objective. Life 
was more complicated than being a crusader for good 
against evil. He now aimed to protect “the innocent, the 
weak, and the deprived,” which included not only law-
abiding residents like Jajuana, but also gang members 
who had made a few wrong choices.

Sometimes Vazquez is overwhelmed by each 
day’s cases. “People don’t realize the extent of evil in 
the world,” he tells me. He almost never discusses his 
work with his wife Ada or with his children. Unlike his 
tumultuous childhood, Vazquez wants to keep his family 
safe and secluded from what he has seen. But sometimes 
the silence worries Ada. When Vazquez leaves after a 
midnight call, she sits up, wondering if he is all right. 
“Every time he walks out the door, I say a little prayer,” 
Ada tells me. “It’s nerve-wracking.” When her stress 
gets too high, she calls him, and he reassures her, “Don’t 
worry. We’re still out here looking for the guy.”

A year after Jajuana was murdered, Vazquez 
investigated the June 2007 killing of Angel Rovira. 
Mitchell Joyner, 17, approached Rovira as Rovira walked 
home from work. A native of Puerto Rico, Rovira did 
not understand Mitchell’s demands for his gold chain, 
so he kept walking. Mitchell pulled out a semi-automatic 
handgun and fired two shots into Rovira’s back, hitting 
an artery in his heart. The victim ran to his apartment 
building a block away and fell down at the entrance. His 
wife and his four-year-old son found the body. 

Rovira’s father flew to New Haven from Puerto 
Rico and began searching for the killer himself. When 
Vazquez heard this from informants on the street, he 
worried Rovira’s father would lose his life, too. Vazquez 
sat the family down and told them to not interfere. The 
father objected. Vazquez might have easily defused 
tensions with a promise to find the killer, but he was 
unwilling to break his rule. 

Vazquez had information that pointed to Mitchell 
as the killer, but he needed a direct confession. In an 
interrogation that he said felt like running a marathon, 
Vazquez took advantage of Mitchell’s remorse. The 
teenager sobbed as he admitted he pulled the trigger. 
“I can’t believe I just got this kid to tell me he did it,” 
Vazquez thought, as he put the boy in handcuffs. He was 
working not against the abstract, innumerable forces of 
gangs, but against one 17-year-old boy with true regret 
in his eyes. Vazquez felt no joy. He felt like the bad guy.
