of two rival gangs filed in for separate meetings. No 
longer relying on sweeps to incarcerate gangbangers, 
Project Longevity offered them a choice. It saw the 
teenagers seated before Vazquez as empowered moral 
actors, able to choose the right path if offered to them. 
Cards were distributed, printed with one telephone 
number that could set up any social service necessary: 
job training, substance abuse therapy, counseling. 
Though he says he is normally shy as a public 
speaker, Vazquez delivered an ultimatum to the 
gang members from the Newhallville and Dwight 
neighborhoods. “I am sick and tired of the calls,” he said 
to the groups. Vazquez laid out the two different paths 
gang members could take: One could save their lives; the 
other would lead them to rot in prison. If a single gang 
member is implicated in a shooting or homicide, local, 
state, and federal authorities will increase surveillance on 
each member of the gang. He could see the hurt in the 
young boys’ eyes as he spoke. “Aren’t you tired of doing 
this? You’re killing yourselves,” he told them.


After the first call-in, only three attendants called 
Project Longevity’s service providers, but the city’s 
violence quieted, with no homicides recorded between 
November and mid-January. The week of the second 
call-in, two people were killed: one in a botched 
commercial robbery that detectives are still pursuing 
leads, and one in a gang-related robbery that Vazquez’s 
unit quickly solved. (Vazquez could not disclose the 
name or gang of the suspect, since he is a juvenile.)


Yet some are betting against Vazquez’s hopes 
for Project Longevity, arguing that the program 
offers nothing new. Scot X. Esdaile, President of the 
Connecticut NAACP, told me that police have done 
stings on gangs for years. “I question the longevity 
of this project,” Esdaile told me. “The anti-violence 
initiatives last for a year or so, they start parading around, 
and then the violence comes back.” In the 1990s, 
Esdaile says police promised an end to violence when 
they locked up members of the Jungle Boys. But the 
shootings did not stop. Police went after the Kensington 
Street Internationals. Then the Island Brothers. Then 
the Newhallville Dogs. The strategy did not work. The 
city continued to bury its young. The solution, Esdaile 
says, is not only law enforcement and social services, but 
also jobs. “It is imperative politicians bring back jobs 
to urban areas,” he told me. “It’s the same situation in 
Chicago, in Detroit, Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven.” 
He is especially concerned about the false hope Project 
Longevity’s social services may offer. If a boy “cuts 
his hair, gets rid of his dreadlocks, pulls up his pants, 
and shines his shoes,” but still can’t find a job, Esdaile 
worries he may return to the street bitter and more jaded 
than before.


But Vazquez and the department believe this time 
is different: with the backing of the community’s leaders 
and service providers, the police department is no longer 
cracking down on gangs alone. They are not hoping to 
lock up every one of the city’s gang members: they goal 
of Project Longevity is that they will not have to lock 
up anyone. 


Vazquez sat in the audience at the second call-in. 
After the talks ended, he spoke to one man in his late 
twenties, whom Vazquez had met years before. The man 
was hunched over from a back injury. “I don’t know why 
I’m here,” the man said in Spanish, adding that he had 
abandoned gang life long ago. Vazquez told him Project 
Longevity could provide medical aid for his back pain 
and any other help he needed. Not everyone was there 
because they were still involved in gangs. “We want you 
to hear the message,” Vazquez told him, “and we want 
you to bring the message to your boys.”


Vasquez wanted to help them, and he was 
optimistic some would change. But he also knew that 
just one failure was likely to undo an entire group. He 
didn’t want to bring the force he had gathered against 
the boys, but he knew he would soon have to. In an odd 
take on the prisoners’ dilemma, where two prisoners 
have been replaced by the police department and the 
city’s gangs, each side has entered into mutual promises; 
each side depends on the other not abusing its trust. It’s 
a significant gamble, bet with the lives of New Haven 
residents: if successful, Project Longevity may save 
people like Jajuana Cole, Angel Rovira and Julian Wells, 
but if the violence continues, police will need to devote 
already strained resources to monitoring the killer’s 
group. 


“If these kids failed to take advantage of what had 
been offered, I have to do what I have sworn to do for 
twenty-one years: uphold the law,” Vazquez tells me. 
“Whether I like it or not, I will do what I have sworn 
to do.”


But more than simply a gamble with the city’s 
safety, Vazquez is making a wager about human nature. 
Vazquez wants to believe that if given a chance, people 
are fundamentally good, that if things had somehow 
been different for Daniel Carter, Mitchell Joyner, and 
Troy Jackson, none of them would have pulled the 
trigger. Vazquez’s faith may seem ideal—quixotic, 
even—from one who has held the dying and sat across 
from their straight-faced killers. 


With so much at stake, we can only hope he is right.
