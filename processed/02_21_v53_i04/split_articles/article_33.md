Running as magic.         

When I was younger, my dad used to tell 
me the story of how he fell in love with 
running. He was fifteen, at a sleepaway camp 
deep in the Vermont woods. One night when he 
was – frustrated with his counselors? bored of the 
routine? I’d like to imagine – he ventured down 
the driveway, and out of the camp. There were no 
cars on the main road, just streetlights and houses 
so deep-set he could only see their windows. And 
sweet, sweet silence. 

My dad ran for miles. Just a skinny boy with no 
phone, tracing the light’s path forward. He says 
he ran every night after that (seems unlikely), and 
that he’d run for hours before he turned around 
(definitely false). My dad has a propensity for 
exaggerating. But I’m sure that’s how it felt, at 
least, and that’s how he told the story.


My dad used to run every Saturday morning 
when I was growing up. It was his one indulgence, 
the only fissure in the armor of my parents’ very 
busy, very responsible lives—a daily rhythm that 
consisted of rising at six, arriving at the hospital 
by seven, and working late into the evening on 
patient records, which they’d shield with their 
hands when I’d pass by their laptops. Somehow, 
they also deposited my sister and me on the bus, 
spread peanut butter on our sandwiches, and 
tucked us into bed. Then back to the computers.

But on Saturday mornings, my dad would dis-
appear from our house with the dog and return 
hours later, covered in mud. At the end of the 
only decent running trail in the suburbs is a 
swampy pond that you could, by very loose stan-
dards, call a swimming hole. My dad would leap 
into the calm, green water with our yellow lab 
like it was the most natural thing to do. At home, 
he’d squat down to clean the mud tracks on the 
kitchen floor, beaming and retelling stories of his 
best running days in San Francisco.
