He was a good man.
It happened first early on Father’s Day. Around 
midnight, after everyone had gone to sleep, I filed 
through his study in search of inspiration for a 
homemade gift––a book he might have half-read, 
a 90’s-sound-in-contemporary-packaging band he 
had discovered, anything that could offer a clue 
about a recent interest he had developed while I 
had been at college. I found the condoms first, 
then the drawings of her naked edges. The timing 
was outstanding. 
He was a good man when he was my father.

It happened rather quickly the second time. 
Or, quite slowly, when you consider the broader 
timeline. At 1:09 a.m. on January 10th, we arrived 
at the hospital. By 1:24 a.m., his colleague in a 
yellow sheet and face shield told us he had died. 
I’m not sure whether it was the first or second 
time that the loss of my father felt more real. It all 
seemed overwhelmingly arbitrary.
He was my father.

Standing in the mirror this morning, I wished 
that I could duplicate myself. If I could exit my 
body, maybe I could scrutinize myself from more 
viewpoints than a mirror’s reflective plane. One of 
me could stay seated in this folded chair, squarely 
centred in my empty new apartment. The other 
me could circle my body, finally concoct some 
sort of judgment. Maybe then I would know what 
I looked like––the true sharpness of my stare, the 
shape of my thighs. More importantly, I could 
watch myself navigate today, and figure out what 
I feel, besides very little. Maybe I’d know what 
to write––we had waited two years to hold an 
in-person service, and I hardly felt any different 
from when he passed. My hands smelled like my 
pencil’s soft wood. Whenever I brought my hands 
to my face, their odor prodded me for my lack of 
progress. The paper was still vacant.
He devoted himself to his children and to his 
patients.
Bullshit. The words felt neither honest nor 
like what the audience wanted to hear. I shoved 
the sheet of paper into my pocket. Sophie was 
waiting downstairs, so I left and folded into her 
Honda hatchback that always smelled like minty 
dirt. Her gaze lingered on me as I stared at the 
morning traffic, deciding from my composure 
whether our destination should be a topic of dis-
cussion.


“So, are we picking up Michelle?” She had 
chosen evasion.
“Seems like she’s not coming.” I rolled the win-
dow down and watched a frayed dog drink from a 
small puddle of Gatorade outside the post office. 
The sun patched angular shapes of sunlight onto 
the upper halves of the apartment buildings lin-
ing the street. It was going to be a nice summer 
day, for most. 
“She told you?”
“Yeah. And, you know, you don’t have to stay 
actually, if you don’t want to.” A warm breeze 
slanted through the window. The air smelled first 
of dew, then hot smoke from the deli. 
“Oh, okay.”
“Thanks.”
“Does your mum have a ride with anyone?”
“She has a car,” I hoped. “She’ll be fine. 
Thanks.” 
Maybe she would be fine. She would acquire 
grief, and organize it into a loving narrative that 
conflated his lack of responsibility for his death 
with that of his decisions. I slumped into courtesy 
and texted her “You need a ride?” and she replied 
a minute later “No thanks. All good sweetie. See 
you soon xo.” She was always “all good sweetie.” 
Something about her propensity for the unsaid, 
for shielding her distress, reminded me to buckle 
my seatbelt right then.
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it 
does not boast, it is not proud.

I had been assigned that overdone piece of 
scripture by my mother. My sister was to read 
accompanying psalms. I had read it at my grand-
parents’ funerals; this time, I was told to integrate 
it with a eulogy because apparently I was an adult. 
At my grandfather’s funeral service at the age of 
twelve, I had felt both weightless and overbear-
ing as I had tried to deliver the words with both 
maximal politeness and an air of understanding 
what it means to grieve. Today, in Sophie’s car, 
my knees bristled with the lob of turns and lane 
changes––but back then, they had vibrated like 
two same-pole magnets as I had spoken in front 
of so many old people and family members. After-
wards, I ate too much carrot cake. Michelle told 
me that my dad had cried during the recitation 
because he loved the passage. I later decided it’s 
because he wished he did. He was never religious 
for the right reasons, which I thought made him 
not religious.

It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seek-
ing, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of 
wrongs.

Or perhaps it was because he knew he had 
been drifting away from representing this inter-
pretation of love.

After an hour, we arrived, so I gave Sophie a 
hug. She held my elbows and took a sentimen-
tal breath as I pulled away, which ruined it for 
me. I resented my coldness to Sophie as I plod-
ded across the soft grass leading up to my father’s 
house. Her awareness of my family bothered 
me, even though she was one of my only col-
lege friends, and my only college friend who had 
moved to the same city as me after graduation. 
And especially because she was one of the only 
ones who I had found the vulnerability to con-
fide in about my father before he contracted the 
coronavirus. 
The glass bungalow looked more sterile than in 
the photo I had seen, more like a horizontal test 
tube than the gleaming construction my mother 
had told me about. You could see the rows of 
folded chairs in the cleared living room from the 
lawn. Michelle appeared next to me on my way 
inside and looped her arm in mine. 
“Jesus, you scared me.” She wore a grey suit, 
the sort of thing she wears to court every day. 
“You came. Thank God.”
“Yeah. Not a fat chance I’m saying what’s been 
prescribed, though.”
“You mean there is a fat chance?”
“That’s what I said.”
“Do you know how she’s doing?”
“We’ll see.”

I found myself breaking from her, then walk-
ing toward the folded chairs in the living room, a 
temporarily empty space for me to write while the 
guests waded into an adjacent room that hosted 
peppermint tea and baby crackers. For weeks, 
I had carried this odd sense of duty toward a 
speech for a man whom I had felt so little obliga-
tion towards for two years. Who was I doing it for? 
At the very least, I needed to accelerate a descent 
into grief.

There were six rows of chairs, separated in the 
middle by an aisle. Three of the walls in the room 
were wrapped in those floor-to-ceiling windows 
that give real estate agents adrenaline rushes. 
The mid-day light ran all around the room in 
gentle slabs. The urn sat at the front, a navy 
blue ceramic egg with a single brass stripe wrap-
ping around its neck. I approached it, and suc-
cumbed to a sudden urge to lift its lid. It was too 
dark to see anything, except for a few sparkling 
specks that picked up the sunlight infiltrating the 
mourning space. I sat down at the seat labelled 
with my name. 
I knew I was supposed to tell a story. Use rhet-
oric to persuade people that my dad lived a com-
plete, good life and that he could have lived a 
longer, equally complete and good life had he 
not died, that I am very sad and moved but grate-
ful and joyful for the time we did share. 
I had a choice between two narratives. There’s 
the one about the father who would oblige my 
incessant requests to ventriloquize my one-eyed 
moose puppet every night before I went to sleep, 
who would stay up and play me The Beatles and 
give me an itchy blanket when I would wake up 
with get-naked-on-the-toilet stomach aches every 
night for a year, who volunteered to coach me 
and my sister’s house league soccer teams. Then 
there was the one who never tried to spend time 
alone with me despite my requesting it, the one 
who told me I “cancelled” him even though I 
gave him many chances and put exactly what I 
wanted from him in letters, in texts, in diplomatic 
conversation, the one who only talked to me to 
check if I was being praised for my talent or if 
I was reading an “authentic” book, the one who 
told me to research “Christian forgiveness” when 
I was upset that he was not making an effort. The 
second father was someone I didn’t know––or, 
more terrifyingly, someone who became who he 
had been waiting to become all this time.

I could not help but think that my father would 
not mourn me at my own funeral. He would be 
bitter that I was not supremely empathetic to him 
after he cheated openly on my mother for three 
years, emotionally abused her, possibly physically 
abused her (she would never tell), always prom-
ised to leave the woman, always disappointed my 
mother, never thought that his kids could be dis-
appointed, too. And worst of all, staying married. 
“The woman,” as we always called her, was an 
orthodontist. I had googled her once, located a 
photo. She looked like a German shepherd, her 
eyes at once endearing, at once like they’d meet 
a stranger’s eyes with a sharpness that one takes 
personally. She looked different from the woman 
my father worshipped in his drawings. I wondered 
if she would be here today. And then I decided I 
did not care.

Sometime between my writing and erasing 
four sentences, my great aunt Abriana, whom I 
had been named after, had wandered into the 
room. Well past the early phases of Alzheimer’s, 
she spoke in circles, always returning to her 
central point, which was that she loved me very 
much. Despite her condition, she was conscious 
of her life in a way that even those mid-life have 
not aged into. And I wondered what I’d think of 
my father when I grew old and grateful, a state 
that seemed unattainable to me even today. Espe-
cially today. 
Abriana was cupping a wine glass filled with 
water. Her grey-tan shoes with velcro straps shuf-
fled slowly under the inefficiency of her hinged 
posture, inching toward the cheap collapsible 
chair next to mine. Once she sat down, she bal-
anced the stem of her glass on her thigh. She
