Vicodin. At one point, I go downstairs to make 
myself some tea and tell my bosses that there’s 
some Nutella I’ve been hoarding in my room, but 
actually they can have some. (If they want.) They 
politely decline, but do offer to make the tea for 
me while I sit down. (Go ahead and sit down.)

The problem is, I’m worried that maybe this 
is what being an adult is: You find the mole on 
yourself. You have anxiety about it. You call the 
doctor. You set up the appointment. You go there. 
You fill out the insurance form. You get the mole 
removed. You get the phone call that more of the 
mole needs to be removed than was previously 
removed. You go back to the doctor. You accept a 
bottle of Vicodin and don’t take more than what 
you’re supposed to, even if you wonder if that 
might be fun. You tell the small child who lives 
with you that she can’t touch your big ouchie, 
even though, yeah, it looks pretty interesting to 
touch. (And at one point she touches it anyway, 
and it feels like being stabbed with a blunt knife.) 
And as you lie around with your drugged-out 
brain, watching Enola Holmes on Netflix and 
wondering, very earnestly, if it might be the best 
movie ever made, the small child pounds on 
the door and demands attention, even though 
you’ve told her you can’t play because you’ve got 
Frankenstein stitches in your stomach, and you 
think about how if a child is very lucky, she gets 
to be the center of her own universe, and how 
you yourself were also a very lucky child—one 
who had countless grown-ups in her life to pack 
her crackers, to know which towel was the special 
towel, to comfort you in the aftermaths of trage-
dies you don’t remember. And maybe, if you do 
it right, you can be one of these grown-ups for 
Daisy, too. And maybe, when she thinks about 
October of 2020, what she’ll remember is this: 
standing in the shade of the sycamore, blowing 
bubbles in her twirly dress, the sky so clear that 
she can see the last one drifting all the way up 
over the top of her house. Just like a unicorn.
