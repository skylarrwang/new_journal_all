A
t the end of August, I am offered a job as a 
live-in nanny with a family in L.A. There’s a 
lot of backstory here, but it might be kind of tedious 
to explain. Here’s the key point: I don’t know this 
family, but the dad grew up Jewish in Oklahoma, 
and so did my mom, and in the same town, and it’s 
a small world down there. So small of a world that, 
when my mom was a teenager and my future boss 
was four years old, my mom babysat him. (He liked 
dinosaurs.) It turns out this is enough information 
for both of us, and I leave New Haven to move into 
his house for the fall. 

Actually, before I move in, I quarantine for ten 
days in an Airbnb in Silver Lake. Almost every 
evening, I mask up and ride a Lime scooter 
down a massive hill, past Echo Park lake, and 
up another massive hill to have al fresco, fifteen-
feet-away meals with my bosses and their tiny 
children. Daisy is four-and-a-half and Marie is 
seven months. (These are not their real names.) 
Because Marie is a little baby who spends most 
of her time sleeping, eating, and benignly vibing 
on the floor, my job will mainly be entertaining 
Daisy, who has been home from preschool since 
the pandemic began. 

When my quarantine is up and I test negative 
twice, I move into the house in Echo Park. I think 
I may have the nicest living quarters of any gov-
erness in the history of governessing. I’m not sure 
what, exactly, I was expecting, but it certainly 
wasn’t this: a giant room on the second floor, one 
window looking out onto the branches of a giant 
sycamore, the other onto downtown Los Angeles. 
And the sheets are made out of something called 
“eco-latex,” which I can only describe as feeling 
like sleeping under a layer of Starbucks’ cold 
foam (This is a positive thing.)

In many ways, by accepting this job, I have 
flashed forward fifteen years into my ideal future. 
My bosses do absurdly cool work for real money. 
They wear clothes from independent design-
ers and have sustainable fish (including the 
bycatch!) delivered to their house. I am intimi-
dated by their friends in our pod, who include an 
architect, two fashion wizards, the host of a quite 
popular podcast, and all their elaborately-named 
children. 

But really, the person I like hanging out with 
most is tiny Daisy. In the beginning, I ask her a 
lot of questions. What’s her favorite animal? A 
unicorn, because when it jumps over houses, it 
can make rainbows. What’s her favorite color? 
Pink and purple and blue and white and rainbow. 
Talking to Daisy is easy—I can tell we’re going to 
get along, and taking this job was a good decision 
instead of an insane one. Daisy has an answer to 
most questions, and if she doesn’t like the ques-
tion, or if the question is too stupid to warrant a 
response, she just ignores it.

As we spend more time (many hours of most 
days) together, I learn that this quality of hers, 
this constant having-of-answers, extends even 
to questions that I might have thought too diffi-
cult, or too upsetting, for her. But she gets it. She 
understands it all. It’s simple for her. Why do we 
wear masks on our walks? To protect our neigh-
bors. Why are all the grown-ups sad? Because a 
great woman died, and they’re scared about what 
might happen without her. Why can’t we play 
outside today? Because someone had a fucking 
gender reveal party and lit half the state on fire.

e flee the fires for La Quinta, California, an 
oasis town sandwiched between the Palm 
Desert and the Coachella Valley. This is where 
they filmed the entirety of The Bachelorette this 
year, and I can tell you right now—it’s a weird 
choice. La Quinta seems like the kind of place that 
shouldn’t exist, the kind of place where you’d pull 
over at a truck stop, pick up a bag of Funyuns, and 
suddenly all the lights would start to flash and the 
cashier would blink his third eye and you’d realize 
you’d accidentally crossed an interdimensional por-
tal. But it’s also kind of bougie and kind of LA, and 
the Airbnb we stay in is clearly set up for Instagram 
influencers, with glittery donut pool floaties, a neon 
sign that read ELECTRIC LOVE, and a ton of 
barely-functional furniture in rose gold and bottle 
green. 

That first night, Daisy and I spend an absurd 
amount of time in the pool. The glittery donut is 
her golden calf. The pool is so over-chlorinated 
that, when we get out, the skin on my face burns. 
Daisy’s eyes are bright red. We’re both euphoric. 
We go to bed and wake up ready to do it all again.

Except that when we come back out to the 
pool, there’s a weird smell. Like an almost chem-
ical stink. We call the Airbnb guy, who in turn 
calls another guy, and that guy comes and stands 
a dozen feet away by the hot tub, sniffing the 
air. He has two theories: something died over 
the fence, or there’s a rattlesnake nearby. Rattle-
snakes secrete. He says this in front of Daisy, who 
promptly decides she never wants to go in the 
pool again. Or outside, for that matter. Remem-
ber that we drove this far for the sole purpose of 
going outside.

And suddenly the landscape changes. Suddenly 
Daisy doesn’t have the answers, and she’s scared, 
and the person who’s supposed to fix it is me. I 
decide immediately that the rattlesnake-secretion 
expert/pool guy is my nemesis. The only way to 
defeat him on the battlefield of Daisy’s beautiful 
mind is to bend reality and the laws of nature. In 
other words, to falsify a PhD in herpetology. In 
other words, to make up fake facts about snakes. 
I tell Daisy that rattlesnakes hate both the 
morning and the afternoon. They cannot stand 
heat and they abhor cold. They don’t like people. 
They don’t like trees. They don’t like anything. I 
have Daisy thinking that rattlesnakes only come 
out in the dead of night, in void-like spaces that 
exist at perfectly neutral temperatures. Nowhere 
near her. Please can we go back in the pool. 
We can. We succeed at being outside for the 
next several days. Then, when it’s time to leave, 
I’m taking the trash out and the bag rips on the 
pool deck and a few chunks of Peking duck, a let-
tuce leaf, and a globular mass of yogurt fall in the 
water. I don’t know then that, later today, we’ll 
spend almost an eternity in a smoke-choked corri-
dor of Southern California, the baby wailing, the 
air acrid, the Taco Bell bathroom shuttered—yes, 
even if you buy something—because of the ongo-
ing global pandemic. As I try to fish the flaccid 
placenta of duck meat out of the water, I wonder 
briefly if this will cause the rattlesnake to return, 
if there ever was a rattlesnake in the first place. 


III. 
hen we get back from La Quinta, I drive to 
Beverly Hills to get my weird mole checked 
out at my boss’s dermatologist. I noticed this mole 
during the summer, and the most romantic way to 
describe it is this: imagine I’m the heroine of a Brid-
gerton-esque period drama, and the handsome lord 
whom I’ve ensnared needs to attend to the affairs 
of his estate, but he also can’t bear to be away from 
me for more than a few moments, so he decides to 
manage his correspondence while standing over my 
prostrate form, and a little droplet of ink spills from 
his quill and lands just to the right of my belly but-
ton. Or, it’s a really dark mole with irregular edges 
that just popped up this summer, so I should proba-
bly go get it checked out, even though I really don’t 
want to because I hate driving in LA and it’s proba-
bly nothing. 

But actually, it’s not nothing and I get a call 
from the dermatologist, who informs me that my 
mole is highly irregular and needs to be removed 
ASAP. This makes me cry, even though the guy is 
like, “You’re going to be fine.” In my defense, it’s 
stressful to have to find a dermatological surgeon 
who is covered by your insurance and available in 
the next few weeks when your weird little mole is 
like a tiny ticking time bomb, just waiting to spew 
more of its evil seeds into your body. 

Eventually I pull myself together, find a doctor 
in my network, schedule an appointment, don 
my N95, and ask my boss to drive me back to 
Beverly Hills because I’m scared that, after my 
surgery, I’m going to be too high to drive myself. 
At the surgery, the nurse looks at my mole in con-
fusion and calls in the doctor, who looks himself 
and says, “This is a really bad mole. I’m sorry, 
because I know you’re young, but you’ll have a 
pretty decent scar.” He then takes out a big blue 
pen and draws a line about three times the size I 
was thinking it would be, right on my skin. 

I’m actually feeling ok, though, because I think 
I’m in love with this doctor. 

Is this man wearing a mask, a face shield, and 
head-to-toe scrubs? Yes. Can I still tell he’s an 
absolute FOX? Yes. (This is not a mask catfish, 
by the way. I could tell you his name and you 
could look him up and agree with me. But I’m 
not going to do that, because I do not objectify 
our #healthcareheroes.) At one point, whilst fin-
gering my new stomach-hole, he asks me where 
I go to school and I say Yale and he says I must 
be pretty smart, huh, and I say hahahahahm-
mmmwell and he says, “I can tell just by talking 
to you.” And this compliment, even though it is 
almost certainly a hollow one—because the most 
interesting thing I’ve said up until this point is 
“Wow, anesthetic really works! I can’t feel any-
thing!”—sends me instantly into a daydream 
where we get married, have beautiful, mole-free 
babies, and I spend the rest of my days throwing 
garden parties for his clients, who are probably 
the Kardashians. 

I spend the rest of the day high as a kite on
