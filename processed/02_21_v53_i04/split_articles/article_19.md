tired. The stares—the smiles—the questions—
the attention in which I had once basked begins 
to feel draining. I want to be one of those girls 
who wears her hair down every day, soft and 
brushing her shoulders. I have stopped visiting 
Pakistan. It matters less and less that my family 
would be disappointed if I returned with my braid 
chopped off. I spend six months watching “Cut-
ting Off My Long Hair!” videos on YouTube, and 
another six convincing my mother to let me go 
through with the cut. I run through my list of rea-
sons: I’m tired of the inconveniences of long hair. 
I’m entering high school next year. I want to feel 
fresh and older and new.

When my elder sister finds out about my deci-
sion, she teases me: “What?” she exclaims. “But 
you’re a good, Pakistani girl!” I bristle. It is only 
years later that I realize it is not the good I object 
to. It is the Pakistani.

When I am seventeen, my Indian friend, who 
has pale skin and pale eyes and shoulder-length, 
layered hair, is complimented for her beauty. 
I watch her smile and shake her head and feel 
something writhe inside of me. I wish it were 
jealousy. Instead it is a deep, rolling rage, one 
that I tuck in and smother. In my head, I imagine 
all the girls tanning and bleaching and cutting 
and dying, vying for the same sort of attention. 
My friend confesses to me that in India, it is only 
her skin that is complimented. For her aunts and 
uncles, her hair is short enough to be shameful.

Afterward, I think about the Femina Miss India 
2019 pageant pictures and the Twitter storm criti-
cizing them: all the women chosen look the same. 
One tweet rants, “They all have the same hair, 
and the SAME SKIN COLOUR, and I’m going 
to hazard a guess that their heights and vital stats 
will also be similar.” I look at the contestants. I 
think: she is right. And I try not to think: they are 
all pale. They are all pale and long-haired and 
beautiful.

That summer, I am sitting on a bench in our 
tiny neighborhood park. The grass is dewy and 
bright. My t-shirt dress brushes the top of my 
knee-caps. The sun, harsh and unforgiving, heats 
up my shins, and my mother frowns at the exposed 
skin. She says I should try and preserve my color. 
I remember how, every day of elementary school, 
she would lather me in sunscreen and full sleeves 
and long pants, until I was old enough to protest. 
Now, she sits beside me in her jeans and UV-pro-
tected long-sleeve. She looks young for her age. 
Her skin is healthy and fair. 
“You’ll tan,” she tells me, and I shrug.
“All my classmates want to tan,” I reply, and 
I’m only half-joking. The Caucasian girls in

my year complain of their paleness. They think 
whiteness looks sickly. After a summer in Florida, 
one holds her forearm up against mine and says, 
“look, I’m even tanner than Anya!” with no small 
amount of pride. 

After my day in the park, I examine my tan 
legs and short hair in my bedroom mirror. I try to 
imagine what my grandmother would think. The 
truth is I did not want to be fresh or new or older 
in high school. I wanted to be white—or whiter, 
at least. 

In Pakistan and India, women cut their hair as 
a sign of defiance. They sever the link between 
femininity and hair length with proud grins and 
the chink-squeak-chink of scissors. They reject 
the models with pale skin and quiet, plastic 
smiles. 7,000 miles away, in my hometown of 
Cleveland, Ohio, I wonder sometimes if I cut my 
hair because I wanted to conform.

The first night after the cut, I lie in bed and 
indulge myself in one moment of terrible, all-con-
suming panic: my lungs freeze in my chest; my 
nails dig into my palms; my eyes go wide and dark 
against the ceiling. Feeling the foreignness of my 
straight-pressed hair, my throat thickens. I feel 
sick. Like a phantom limb, I imagine my braid 
stretching out beneath me, curling underneath 
my pillow, and I realize suddenly, terribly, how it 
is gone, really, truly gone, that by now it has been 
deemed worthy of donation and shipped away, 
that if I ever want to grow it back it will take years, 
maybe a decade, before I feel the weight of my 
braid again. I have made an irreversible decision. 
I have become something I am not, or, rather, 
have given up something that I was. I fall asleep 
with my cheeks wet.

The next morning, my panic feels silly. Walk-
ing up the steps of my high school, I do feel new, 
with my short ponytail pretty and bouncing. The 
day is bright with winter sun. In assembly, my 
friends giggle and grin. Classmates I rarely talk 
to stop to compliment me in the halls. In the eve-
ning, when my mother asks me if I regret it yet, I 
shake off any remnants of the night’s grief. “No,” 
I reply. “Of course not.”

Four years later, and my hair has grown back 
long enough to braid. It is nowhere near its old 
length. I doubt it ever will be: I am in the habit 
of cutting it at the start of each year. I do not feel 
rebellious. At least, not anymore. Sometimes, 
looking at my reflection in that very same salon, 
I feel that I am severing away little parts of myself 
(my cousin’s gaze; the smell of mehndi). But I 
hold on to that doubt. It tethers me in a way that

feels necessary. Secure. Other times, I feel the 
same elation at my short hair that I felt four years 
ago. I relish in its soft swishing and high pony-
tails. 

I know cutting my hair is a choice, and that 
choice is mine; I suppose that sometimes that 
responsibility is hard to swallow. Alone in my 
dorm room my first year, I braid my hair before 
bed, for fear of tangles and catastrophe. Against 
the bustle and novelty of college life, the action 
is soothing. I miss, sometimes, the weight of my 
long hair against my back, the subtle shifting 
when it swung side-to-side. If I think back far 
enough, I miss my mother’s brown hands weav-
ing the strands together, slick with coconut oil 
and the smell of home.
