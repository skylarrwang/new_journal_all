M
y mother’s frown is brittle. Her hovering is 
making the hairstylist nervous, I can tell. She 
offers my mother a coffee in another room. My 
mother’s eyes track the tiny silver scissors, the siz-
zling straightener, and the array of thickly-scented 
styling products. Polite and cool, my mother says, 
“No, thank you.”

“Mom doesn’t approve, then?” the hairstyl-
ist jests, her voice a little high-pitched. But the 
joke falls flat in the strained silence between us. 
“Right,” she mutters, shaking her head and grab-
bing the straightener. She begins to chatter as 
she splits my hair into sections and scorches each 
into obedience. I can feel her relax into her rou-
tine: her deft, thin fingers pulling and pinching 
and burning. She talks about her two dogs, the 
week of pleasant weather we’ve been having, and 
how much she loves the Shake Shack down the 
street. I appreciate the effort. She must sense the 
anxiety building in me, climbing my spine and 
seizing my shoulders, leaving me wide-eyed and 
frozen in the mirror. In the reflection, I watch 
as the hairstylist rifles through a drawer, push-
ing a pair of scissors aside in favor of picking up 
a pile of hairbands. It is easier to focus on her 
actions (quick, loud, sure). It is easier not to look 
at myself. 

When she ties the first hairband, I swallow. Her 
hands, pale and manicured, lack the warmth of 
my mother’s. They braid with efficiency and pre-
cision, tying the second band an inch from the 
ends of my hair. “Cutting two feet of hair!” she 
exclaims. “That’s incredible.”
        	 “Yeah,” I say awkwardly. “Thanks.”

“You ready?”

I nod, and the world narrows down to the 
chink-squeak-chink of the scissors sawing their 
way through my braid. I can see my own eyes 
widen in the mirror. There’s a last bit of resis-
tance, and then—then—

My shortened hair springs free from where 
the bands have been severed, swishing around 
my shoulders. My god! It’s so light! A part of me 
squeals. I feel vaguely dizzy, grinning. My mother 
is saying something—the hairstylist is passing 
her my cut braid, now a limp, dead thing, to be 
wrapped in plastic and donated—but all I can 
hear is a faint buzzing in my ears.

The hairstylist continues to press and snip and 
pull. I watch it all in the mirror, the tension leak-
ing out of me, leaving a pleasant, tipsy sensation. 
When she is finished, I have been born anew. I 
remove the towel from my shoulders. I cannot 
stop smiling. Somewhere beside me, my mother 
is watching intently. Her hands grasp the bag now 
weighed down with my braid. She is bristling

with disapproval.

“Well?” the hairstylist asks. “What do you 
think?”

And then, before the idea can be clamped 
down or tempered, I think: I look American, now.
 

 In elementary school, letting my hair down is 
more of an event than an action. I call it “open-
ing my hair”—the result of learning English from 
two Pakistani immigrants. My mother forbids me 
from undoing my braid in class for fear of tan-
gles and catastrophe, but every once in a while, 
when I feel particularly rebellious, I pull off the 
hairband and let my curls dangle down to my 
knees. Some of my classmates stare and giggle. 
Others do a double-take, unable to recognize me 
with wavy blackness framing my face. Others still 
frown or grimace, or ask, out of genuine curiosity, 
“But why?” and “Will you ever cut it?”  

As a child, my answer is always no. My friends 
make bets on how long my braid will be by my 
wedding day. I explain to one of my third-grade 
classmates, with a little too much honesty, “I 
won’t be pretty without my hair. It’s what people 
know me for.” In the winters, when I visit Paki-
stan, my aunts praise my braid. My younger cous-
ins watch with rapt attention as my mother care-
fully interweaves the locks, coating each section 
with coconut oil and tenderness.  

In Pakistan and India, hair has long been a 
point of pride for women. My mother and my 
mother’s mother and my mother’s mother’s 
mother all carried the same black braid down 
their backs, the same proud tilt to their shoul-
ders. In ancient Indian sculptures and paintings, 
the women’s hair is styled in draping loops and 
piled knots, embellished with jewels and tiaras. 
In everyday life, scholars believe, coiffures were 
used to differentiate amongst social classes. In 
religion, gods were distinguished by their individ-
ual hairstyles: Shiva’s jata. Lord Krishna’s curls.

Today, the pressure on women in the Indian 
subcontinent to keep their hair long is so strong 
that styles above the shoulders are considered rad-
ical. Models are fired for cutting their hair. Bobs 
are seen as unprofessional. Pixies and buzzcuts 
are unheard of. Women who choose to wear 
their hair short do so knowing that they are an 
exception to the norm: a tiny, rallying rebellion. I 
think of my mother’s disapproval, of my own ela-
tion. I think of all the times my mother told me, 
you’ll regret it; I think of her running her hands 
through my hair, helping me cover it in thick, 
wet mehndi, praising its tint of red in the sun. 
 I try to convince myself that I am defiant.

By the end of middle school, though, I am
