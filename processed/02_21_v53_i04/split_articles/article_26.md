Sabarimala is a spiritual destination for Hindus 
everywhere. Located in my parents’ home state of 
Kerala, it’s the mountain where Ayyappa, a prince 
and Hindu deity, meditated until he united with 
the divine world. The pilgrimage is sacred but 
rare. And this was my chance. Only girls under 
the age of ten and women over fifty are permitted 
to enter the temple since the God who resides 
there is celibate. 


The night before our hike, my uncle, 
fondly known as Valiyacha, took me shopping. 
Driving through roads in India is terrifying. My 
uncle accelerated and swerved past cars like in a 
scene out of an action movie; the smell of burnt 
tires permeated the air. Miraculously, we arrived 
safely at a bazaar with bodegas selling everything 
from shoes and t-shirts to snacks and tea. I spotted 
a tiny kiosk with sandals lining its exterior. There, 
I picked out the prettiest pair of flip-flops in all 
of India to wear. Sleek and glossy, the black rub-
ber sandals fit snugly around my feet, as though 
crafted just for me. It would have been much 
more sensible to choose sneakers or shoes with 
any grip whatsoever. But I wanted the sandals, so 
Valiyacha paid and we headed back.

The next morning, we woke up before dawn. 
My mother couldn’t believe I’d chosen flimsy 
flip-flops to wear on my pilgrimage but mustered 
enough self-control not to yell at me in front of 
my cousins.

She took me aside. I had to hike the moun-
tain in “the right state of mind”—as an American 
and a soon-to-be woman, it was unlikely I’d ever 
climb it again. She told me that a star shone on 
top of the mountain, which was Lord Ayyappa 
himself blessing those who made the journey. I 
didn’t listen. I concentrated on the way my toes 
felt pressed against the hot black rubber, soft and 
supportive—I’d never owned such sleek, sophisti-
cated sandals. I got in the car with my Valiyachan, 
my father, and my brother, the sandals sealed to 
the soles of my feet.

Upon arriving at Sabarimala, we strolled past 
barefoot men holding bamboo chairs, waiting 
to carry people up the mountain for a small fee. 
Skinny men beckoned kids with colorful, plas-
tic toys like bait—pinwheels, poppers, cotton 
candy—hoping for a rupee or two.

The journey up Sabarimala begins with 
eighteen golden steps. If it’s your first time, you 
must break a coconut on the first step. Prideful, 
I attempted numerous times to throw and break 
the coconut. Despite my best efforts, my dad 
stepped in, guiding my hand, gracefully casting 
the coconut onto the step.

A crowd of people gathered close to the base, 
mostly the elderly and sick. One woman, boils 
marking her skin, lay sprawled across a thin, pink 
sheet and begged for money. Another woman 
stood nearby, skin barely hanging off the bone, 
asking for scraps of food. Most travelers ignored 
them, except the occasional one tossing a coin 
onto their blankets, which they received with 
wails of joy. As we walked by, I looked at my 
dad, who returned my hopeful gaze with despair, 
implying wordlessly that there was nothing we 
could do. The desolate and deprived lay begging, 
while we, fixated on spiritual guidance, marched 
on. Out of sight, out of mind. I looked down at 
my new black sandals and, despite myself, was 
happy. We walked on. I stared in awe at the bare-
foot men running up the mountain, carrying peo-


It began to drizzle, and the trail steepened. 
Valiyachan, whose hand I gripped for support, 
slipped as the rock beneath us lost friction. In 
shock, I pulled my hand away and began to roll 
down the mountain. I struggled to cling to the 
path escaping from underneath me. My father 
rushed after me, but it was too late. One of my 
beautiful black sandals was gone. It had fallen 
behind us, leaving my right foot bare. I begged 
my Valiyacha to go back in search of it, and when 
that failed, I pleaded to my father, too. They 
stood firmly and told me it was a lost cause. 

I erupted in anger. My dad carried me, pat-
ting my back as I cried over my lost flip-flop. Men 
who passed stared at my father and brother with 
pity. They were the unlucky bunch tasked with 
bringing a little girl up the mountain. I pouted 
and whined on my father’s back until we were 
halfway up the holy hill. 

Calmer, but still upset, I looked around. Ven-
dors sold refreshments to weary travelers. My 
Valiyachan’s eyes darted across the stands, and he 
skillfully chose two bags of masala-flavored Lays 
chips for my brother and me. Soothed by the 
snacks, I trod onward until we reached the top, 
but the feeling of slippery rock beneath my right 
foot reminded me of what I’d lost.

At the top, I placed my remaining shoe next to 
my brother’s in a designated space allocated for 
devotees to remove their footwear before entering 
the temple.

We walked up to the entrance, and my fixation 
on the lost sandal subsided. I looked up at the 
figurehead in front of me: a tall granite cylinder 
engraved with curving, sacred symbols. Idols of 
Gods twice my size lined the inside of the tem-
ple, adorned with brilliant red and white flowers 
and jewelry. The priest handed my father coco-
nut halves, and I was instructed to pour fresh 
ghee into mine, a representation of body and 
soul. I felt my heart dance as I prayed in unison 
with the other travelers. As a child, I never felt 
overly connected to my culture.  My inability to 
speak Malayalam or understand our religion’s 
mythology created barriers. Back home, our tem-
ple, usually vacant, would host the whole Hindu 
population of the Northeast on holidays. Down 
the street from Dunkin Donuts, its Indian archi-
tecture created a discernible deviation in the 
Hockessin, Delaware skyline. But at Sabarimala, 
I felt more connected to my culture—as much as 
a seven-year-old American could be. Here was a 
group of people who believed so much in some-
thing, they climbed up a mountain in hopes of 
maybe, possibly getting blessed by a God who 
maybe, possibly existed. It may have been foolish, 
but it was beautiful.


We made our rounds across the temple, pray-
ing to the larger-than-life icons for peace and 
prosperity. After completing the ceremonies, I 
stood at the top of the hill and looked around. 
Valiyacha was teaching my brother how to whis-
tle, and my dad rested before the hike back down.

It was early evening, just before sunset. I 
looked up at the hazy, blue-pink sky and, in 
that moment, I saw it. I swear, I saw it. Above 
the mirage of green trees and hilltops, above the 
defecating boars, above the beggars, above the 
men holding up their superiors, above my lost 
shoe, that star shone. The very star my mother 
had told me about. Lord Ayyappa was coming to 
bless those who made the journey. Coming to 
bless me. 

I’d read about moments of clarity in books: 
a feeling of completeness, being chosen to do 
something bigger than oneself. My seven-year-
old self felt it, too: an air of pride and connection 
that made me know we had gathered for some-
thing real. I rushed over to my brother, begging 
him to come quick. When we looked back up at 
the sky, it was gone. He chided me for thinking I 
was special, as any good older brother does, and 
went back to whistling. My father reassured me. 
If I saw the star, it was there.

The trip down was fast. My mother waited for 
us at the base and listened as we recounted our 
journey. I recounted the tale with fervor, empha-
sizing the great loss of my sandal on the rocky 
terrain. I told my mom I saw the star; I received 
Lord Ayyappa’s blessing. Much to my surprise, 
she began to laugh. The star appears in January, 
she said. It was December. And, if I had listened 
to her and not worn those flimsy sandals, then I 
wouldn’t have lost my shoe, she told me. No—if I 
had listened to her, I wouldn’t have seen the star. 
I would have been too content thinking about my 
beautiful shoes.
