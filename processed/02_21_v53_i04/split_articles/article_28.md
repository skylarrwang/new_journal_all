spilled only a little onto her trousers.
“Did you see the flowers?” She was smiling as 
she spoke. She always smiled so much. It always 
made me sad. “Beautiful hydrangeas.” It was odd 
that my father had hydrangeas planted. They 
were always my mother’s favorite, so I thought 
that he would at least let her have the flowers.
“Not yet.”
“You should see them before the ceremony.”
“I will.”
“Still writing?”
“I’m nearly done.”
“It doesn’t quite look that way.” The paper was 
still open on my lap. “Honey. Is everything okay?”
“Been better. But I’m okay, Abri.” She moved 
a hand away from her glass and placed it over 
mine, still gripping my pencil.
“This must be so hard.” She made an effort to 
twist her head to meet mine. This was a flailing 
sensitivity I was not accustomed to from my great 
aunt, but that I was from Sophie. She offered me 
some of her water, holding it out with two hands. 
I told her no thanks. 
I guided the glass back toward her knee. “You 
know. Don’t you?” Our eye contact was over-
whelmingly direct. I began darting my gaze inter-
mittently to her forehead to soften the intensity 
of our seeing.
“Why, yes,” she said. “Dear.” 
“Jesus. Okay.” I knew my grandparents had 
known my father’s secret. But the woman with 
dementia I saw only twice a year? The prospect 
of speaking well of my father in front of a crowd 
of family and friends who were aware of his aban-
don of his family rapidly nauseated me.
“I love you very much, Abriana.”


After my mum’s speech, flattened with 
words like “intelligent” and “well-known” and 
“nice” and everything that means nothing, she 
had her singing friend come in with her guitar. 
The woman wore a purple dress and played a ver-
sion of “In My Life” at the ceremony that failed 
to rupture from the song’s clichéd status. 
Most of my memories of the song were from 
dainty listening sessions with my father in his 
study when I was a child. He used to expose 
this strange hole of fragility in himself when he 
listened, and all I had wanted was to climb in 
and explore. I had thought it beautiful, rare, and 
exclusive, revealed just for me. Most of these 
memories were rendered defective because of 
the times when I got high in college and played 
the song softly from my cell phone after getting 
home at 3 a.m. when Sophie was asleep. These 
sessions smeared my happy memories with the 
knowledge that I would only ever understand 
positive associations of the song in the context 
of loss. Yet today, despite too-much-ness of the 
emotion laced into her voice, the middle-aged 
woman’s singing reminded me of when I used to 
unskillfully emote while singing the same song. 
Sitting cross-legged on the sticky rug in his study, 
I would think myself an artist, and then he would 
tell me I could be one.


“And now we’ll hear a few words from 
Thomas’s second daughter, Abriana.” Apparently 
Michelle had chosen not to speak. She put her 
hand on my forearm and squeezed it gently, as if 
to both encourage me and let me know that she 
was not sorry about her refusal.


I rose slowly, feeling the dual heaviness 
and surrealism of a dark dream come over me. My 
father was a good man. He devoted himself to his 
children and his patients. I wiped the moisture 
on my palms onto the sides of my cotton pants. 
He loved the song “In My Life,” and because of 
him I loved it too. Actually, one time, we even 
I looked up on the walk toward the podium, 
and I saw that my great-aunt had also risen to the 
call of our name from the other side of the aisle. 
No one had informed her that she was not sup-
posed to speak in the time that she had walked 
from the third row to the front. We approached 
each other just in front of the podium, where the 
urn was placed on a narrow black stand. For a 
moment, I realized how I might look from the 
outside, where Abriana walked: wobbly, fogged, 
and surrendered. In a loud whisper, I said “Abri, 
I think it’s my turn.” 
Sitting cross-legged on the sticky 
rug in his study, I would think 
myself an artist, and then he 
would tell me I could be one.


Love is patient, love is kind.
But she kept walking toward me as I spoke, try-
ing to hear me a little better. As she shuffled, she 
turned her ear to face mine. Her shoulder brisked 
the stand, and she walked right through it. The 
urn wobbled for a moment, and then it slowly fell 
into my hands that had jolted into a position to 
save it. I caught the urn.           
Then, I let it fall. 
Love is not proud.
Jagged slices of the urn radiated from the 
ground. The ashes poured out, bloomed upwards 
and out over the heads of everyone in the lit-
tle room, and then floated downwards. The air 
became a suspension of his body, so much so that 
it quickly became difficult to see the windows on 
the other side. Larger flecks fell faster onto sur-
faces, onto guests’ hair, and inside purses. Clarity 
could be found if you were near the edge of the 
room, where you could look out the nearest win-
dow. It was awful.
It was maybe a little funny. Or at least ironic, 
that the carrier of the virus that killed him now 
contained all of him. As if he could now infect 
us.
Sometime after calming my mother with hot 
tea and a sit out on the lawn, burying the urn in 
the garden patch with the blue hydrangeas, I left. 
Sophie was waiting in her car.


Inevitably, she noticed the windows 
caked with remains. I explained. She paused 
before responding until the gravel driveway dis-
appeared and skinny trees replaced the glass 
house.
“Who’s going to clean it?” she asked.
“Not sure. Someone lucky.”
