**Title: Siddhartha**
**Author: Herman Hesse**
**Page number(s): 43-44**

In the Buddhist novel Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, Siddhartha – the beautiful son of a revered Indian Brahmin – runs away from home, leaving behind his family and village in search of spiritual fulfillment. He joins a group of wandering ascetics and adopts their practices, but ultimately, he decides he must seek meaning on his own. After parting ways with his best friend, he sets off alone, walking slowly through nature and pondering the world around him.
Finally, he is awakened.
He looked around, as if he was seeing the world for the first time… Blue was blue, river was river, and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and divine lived hidden... The purpose and the essential properties were not somewhere behind the things, they were in them, in everything.
When I run, I look at the rivers and the sky and the forests, and I feel this everything. It feels like a collective breath in, and sigh out. Like the closest thing to religion I’ve felt.


**Title: Running as a physical addiction.**
**Page number(s): 44**

After I got into college, I spent my senior year running up and down the inclines of Jerome Jay. If you run from one end of Jerome Jay to the other and back, it’s an even four miles, but if you turn left and run until you reach the main road, the entire loop can reach up to eight. I memorized the plants in front of the houses, memorized the place where my feet made a strange sound because the road is filled in with a different concrete, and noticed the passage where the trees become so thick that for a few seconds it feels like you’re in a wind tunnel. I ran Jerome Jay regardless of the weather, my homework, friends, or whatever else was going on in my life. At school, I often felt my body longing for the unparalleled freedom and stillness of running. 
Running as a physical addiction. Running as the substance of life. Running as My Big Feeling. 


**Title: Running remained my savior in college.**

Running remained my savior in college. My elixir for all evils. I found another hill – Prospect Street – and I ran up and down every day. Sometimes I’d run twice in one day and my hair became bone dry from showering. One weekend, I ran a half-marathon.
There was no sadness or anger or loss that running could not heal. It was not so much that running fixed whatever was bothering me, but that it returned me to myself. To a feeling of power and stability and connection with nature. When my friends coupled up and found boyfriends and girlfriends to hold them, I’d wake up early and run. Yes, there was loneliness, but running was a fundamentally un-lonely feeling. I got in the habit of outstretching my arms like my dad did when I ran down Prospect Street and I felt that the world was embracing me. In this sense, running became a form of praying.
When I reported back to my dad about my runs, I swear he sounded jealous, as if I had gone to visit a mutual friend without inviting him. As a peace offering, I sent him a copy of Murakami’s book. 


**Title: During spring break of my sophomore year,**
**Page number(s): 44-45**

During spring break of my sophomore year, I returned to my Jerome Jay running route. As much as I loved the burnt orange leaves of Prospect Street, there was something about Jerome Jay that felt deeply comforting. 
On a particularly euphoric run, I veered off onto a new side street to extend my route. The sun had just set, and the sky was stained with dark blue clouds that clustered around the impossibly large mansions with their sprawling front yards. I had never been down this street before and it turned out to be a long cul-de-sac. I turned around at the end, pleased with my extra distance and discoveries.
Then suddenly: fear. My breath caught and my body turned into tingling, screaming nerves.
An orange car with its top down drove slowly towards me. It was the only car on the street and I scanned quickly and saw no cars in driveways. Found nothing in my pockets.
The man in the front seat watched me speed up, fumble with my phone. At the last second, I hopped off the road and darted through the front yard towards the woods behind one of the houses. 
The car paused before the end of the cul-de-sac, where it meets Jerome Jay, and I thought for a second it would leave. That I had overreacted. But it re-entered the cul-de-sac, blocking my exit, and heading straight towards me. For just a moment, we made eye contact.
I sprinted deeper into the woods and called my dad and tried to breathe.


**Title: On the drive home, my dad asked questions.**
**Page number(s): 45**

On the drive home, my dad asked questions. He said he didn’t understand how this had happened. I said I was not surprised.
I stretched out my legs in the car. Left leg. Knee to nose. Right leg. Knee to nose. 
For the rest of spring break, I wanted to run, but every time I got out of my car on Jerome Jay, my heart started racing. I’d bring pepper spray, a button sounding an alarm, and a ring that converted into a knife on my finger, but I’d still spend the entire run looking over my shoulder. Every time a car passed, I’d hover my finger over 911 and plan out my escape route in my head. 
There was nothing that could be done. I asked my dad to run with me a couple of times, and I’d wait at the front door as he finished his work. I felt powerless sitting in the car next to him, like a child that needed a chaperone just to go outside. I felt ashamed of being so upset. 


**Title: At school, I began running with friends.**

At school, I began running with friends. Our chatter fueled my legs further than they could take me alone, but the next day, the urge to run by myself remained, like a small but persistent plant begging to be watered.
So just weeks after the incident at home, I ran up Prospect by myself, weapons in hand. Running became a new sort of prayer – don’t kill me, don’t kill me– I would chant at every passing car, readying my pepper spray, my friend’s phone number already dialed in. Please – the car slowing beside me – punish me some other way.
I felt small, staring up at the empty sky, my feet pitter-pattering down the sidewalk. My heart dangled a few feet in front of me, a large tangle of blue tissue and feelings and veins.
Running as a reckoning. As a way of pleading with God and being answered, with my life, again and again and again.
One afternoon, a few miles away from campus, a car with one man inside pulled over beside me. This is it, I thought. There is no one else here and no woods to hide in. Somehow it felt expected, inevitable. I waited.
Coincidentally, a friend texted me, asking what I was doing and I frantically tapped out a response. She stayed on the phone with me, as I ran into someone’s backyard, and called an Uber back to campus. 
Back in my room, I thought I had misjudged the situation. The car had probably been harmless. But the big ball of blood and veins groaned out. Something was wrong. Is there something you believe in? Anything?
I sat down at my desk and returned to my classes.
