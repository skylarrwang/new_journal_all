Any campaign to build trust in the vaccines will have to contend with a system that 
continues to entrench its opposite.

to accumulate, and making the case that they’re 
unwarranted is significantly harder than seeding 
them.    
The seeders have had a century-long head start. 
“Anti-vaxxers today are recycling arguments that 
were made a century ago, because those argu-
ments are coming from a similar set of mistakes 
in the way people think about data and look at 
data, and similar underlying fears,” Jonathan Ber-
man, a professor of biology and physiology at the 
New York Institute of Technology, and the author 
of Anti-vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed 
Movement (MIT Press, 2020), told me. Fair Hav-
en’s Dr. Lamm had said something similar, that 
early on, many people had misinterpreted the 
mRNA method the new vaccines use. While 
mRNA trains cells to produce a harmless protein, 
triggering an immune response, many believed 
the vaccine actually rewrote DNA. Others fixated 
on the infinitesimally few bad reactions reported 
in the news. Another law of misinformation: data 
is often manipulated, but it doesn’t have to be in 
order to be misinterpreted. 
This new generation of anti-vaxxers has 
the added advantage of leveraging internet 
echo-chambers and viral misinformation––the 
sort social media algorithms amplify, and 
the absence of regulation permits. “Now we 
have a huge increase in vaccine hesitancy 
and in people who are actively sharing 
anti-vaccine ideas,” Berman said. “Part of 
it is simply that we can communicate bet-
ter now than we ever could.” I got a glimpse 
of the bottomlessness of the problem when 
I went looking for his book on Amazon. The 
“Products related to this item” box, at the 
bottom of the page, threw up a pamphlet 
on death-curing elixirs––what the Big Guys 
don’t want you to know. 
“Part of it is also that a lot of the prob-
lems we have socially have never been fully 
solved,” he continued. “That makes an envi-
ronment where people can be persuaded 
with lies and misinformation that are pre-
mised on their underlying social concerns.” 
Anti-vaccination is a perennial instinct in 
modern society with roots in every other fear––of 
change, authority, lies, unfreedom, illness, and 
death. It’s been made into a struggle for the self. 
For that reason, it won’t, at least wholly, lose to 
“facts and logic.” The solution’s as complicated as 
the problem is clear: “Until people deal with the 
trust issue, there’s not going to be much change,” 
said Bernard Macklin, the Flu Outreach Coor-
dinator at the Community Alliance for Research 
and Engagement (CARE) in New Haven. 
Plenty besides anti-vax militants and mys-
tics don’t yet trust that the Pfizer and Moderna 
vaccines are safe. In the latest round of polling 
from the Associated Press and the NORC Cen-
ter for Public Affairs Research, roughly a third 
of respondents said they were unlikely to (17 
percent) or categorically wouldn’t (15 percent) 
accept a vaccine. Nearly half in that category will 
have to come around for widespread immunity 
to take hold––for the coronavirus to become just 
another endemic disease we inoculate against 
yearly. 

In Connecticut, the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
most recent survey of vaccine hesitancy found 
that distrust of the vaccines and of government 
was most pronounced in the African American 


community. Thirty six percent of African Ameri-
can respondents expressed reluctance because of 
a lack of “trust in COVID-19 vaccines,” and close 
to 38 percent because of a lack of “trust in the 
government.” In comparison, less than 20 per-
cent of Asian, Hispanic, and white respondents 
attributed their concerns to either rationale. 

Like vaccine clinical trial data, those figures 
can be prolifically misinterpreted, and used to 
buttress dangerous conclusions. “We consistently 
end up with scenarios where instead of asking 
questions that cast aspersions on the healthcare 
system, we always ask questions that cast asper-
sions on African Americans and their behavior,” 
Harriet Washington, author of Medical Apart-
heid, a history of racism in medicine and winner 
of the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award 
for Nonfiction, told me. “The question we should 
be asking is, what is it about our healthcare sys-
tem that is not getting the vaccine to people in 
necessary numbers, and not getting the vaccine 
to every group when it should. Instead we’re 
asking, what is it about African Americans that 
would cause them to reject the vaccine.” 

Any campaign to build trust in the vaccines 
will have to contend with a system that continues 
to entrench its opposite––the “reasons why,” as 
Washington put it, “African Americans might be 
barred from the vaccine and may not have access 
to it. We know a lot of them already: less likely to 
have a personal physician, more likely to live in 
an area where the safety net hospitals are closing, 
lack of transportation, lack of having jobs that 
allow you to take time off for things like doctor’s 
appointments and getting vaccines.” Access, like 
trust, Washington said, begins with understand-
ing systems and individuals’ place in them, not 
with hypothesizing motives.     

The state’s outreach campaign is expected to 
begin in earnest come the summer, ideally when 
most who want a vaccine have received at least a 
single dose. “We’re looking to June,” said Ham-
den State Representative Josh Elliott, who sits on 
the Governor’s Vaccine Advisory Board. “That’s 
closer to when we’ll need to actively reach people 
who are skeptical.” The process will require cen-
tral coordination on a decentralized approach––
with labor unions, shelters, pantries, pastors, and 
local doctors––with the goal of restoring “reason-
ably lost trust in government.” 

The testimony of friends, family, and other 
trusted messengers will be instrumental to that 
effort, which is part of CARE New Haven’s, 
NSRN’s, and the Yale program’s plans. As more 
people take the vaccine, others in the commu-
nity will likely be more inclined to––a general 
sense, borne out by the data. The Census report 
from January concluded that “worries about 
side effects” and “plans to wait and see whether 
the vaccine’s safe” were the two most common 
grounds for hesitancy. When we spoke, CARE’s 
Bernard Macklin mentioned that he had received 
his first shot just the other day, and felt good. “I’m 
still here,” he said, “And now, I’m a witness.”
