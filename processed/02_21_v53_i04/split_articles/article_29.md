or the first time since they closed in March 
2020, New Haven Public Schools opened its 
doors to students enrolled in Pre-K through fifth 
grade on January 19, following a reopening plan 
that Philip Penn, Chief Financial Officer of NHPS, 
likened to “changing a tire on a car while driving 
down the highway.”
After months of delay, the Reopening Task 
Force, founded in April 2020 to assess how 
schools might welcome students back with new 
safety protocols, settled on a corporate-inspired 
plan that involves “tiger teams”—a method of 
dividing up the work amongst smaller groups, 
according to Penn.
“If you look at [reopening New Haven schools] 
as the only problem, it’s overwhelming,” he 
explained. “But then if you continue to break 
that down into smaller and smaller pieces, the 
challenges become less dramatic.” As the leader 
of the Facilities and Operations team of the task 
force, Penn’s focus included drafting protocols 
for safety inside the schools, including floor 
plans equipped for social distancing, a face mask 
requirement, and training guidelines on hygiene 
in the classroom for staff.  
Outside the task force, Daniel Diaz, Parent 
Engagement Coordinator for the district, has 
worked to include parents in the reopening plans 
as well, by keeping them informed and involved 
in public meetings and surveys. Diaz stressed 
how he––along with the rest of the Youth, Fam-
ily, and Community Engagement department––
worked to set up helplines for specific needs of 
families in the district. “We developed a family 
helpline where parents can actually call and 
ask questions, even if they needed food, if they 
needed support with technology, if they needed 
coats, if they needed computers,” he said. Diaz 
also explained that additional helplines were 
developed as needs arose, such as a helpline spe-
cifically for homework, and others for IT support 
and special education. 
However, according to Diaz, the most severe 
need among families using the helplines was 
food. He noted that the district has provided 
lunch for students learning remotely, by working 
with local organizations like Arte Inc. and Chris-
tian Community Action. “When parents call the 
family helpline, and tell us they need this, we 
actually act on it,” Diaz explained. While Diaz 
did not provide any specific statistics on the usage
