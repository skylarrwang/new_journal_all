However, because Coffin already owned all 
the trucks and the Humphrey street staging loca-
tion, he continued the operation even as revenue 
dropped significantly. 

When Big Green Truck Pizza expanded into 175 
Humphrey, it began offering takeout from a cen-
tral location for the first time, instead of relying on 
the usual trucks for catering. This aligns with the 
broader trends in New Haven’s pandemic restau-
rant industry, which increasingly favors takeout and 
delivery. So while Next Door could not sustain its 
in-person dining, Big Green Truck Takeout could 
take off in the exact same space. 

As for whether these trends will continue post-pan-
demic? “I think the best analogy I can come up with 
is that if the restaurant world was a snow globe, it’s 
suddenly been shaken up,” Coffin said. “And we’re 
waiting to sort of see how it’s going to settle out. All 
of us are trying to figure out what particular format 
is going to work for us.”

New restaurants have been opening their doors in 
the shadow of a decimated restaurant industry, thriv-
ing on the low overhead costs of takeout and deliv-
ery. Ever since Covid-19 changed social norms such 
that more restaurants can now survive exclusively as 
takeout or delivery locations, it has been easier for 
some restaurants to start up during the pandemic. At 
least six new restaurants have opened in New Haven 
during the pandemic—Crafted by Hand Cafe, 
Vegan Ahava, Edible Couture, Haven Hot Chicken, 
SaladCraft Co. and L’épicerie Choupette—most of 
whom remain centered around takeout and delivery 
even as Connecticut has allowed up to 50 percent 
indoor dining capacity. 

Especially during this pandemic-induced deliv-
ery surge, many New Haven restaurants have out-
sourced food delivery to apps such as UberEats, 
Grubhub, or DoorDash. Coffin reached out to me 
unprompted one evening to discuss the rise of these 
delivery apps, all of which have become massive 
Silicone Valley conglomerates. As a self-described 
“pizza guy,” Coffin has been shocked at the apps’ 
success, as “back in the day” New Haven pizza 
restaurants had to do delivery for free to maintain 
their customer base. The apps don’t just charge 
customers—they also charge restaurants large fees,

sometimes up to 30 percent per order, which fur-
ther lowers restaurants’ profit margins in already try-
ing times. Beyond financial pressures, Coffin feels 
that the prevalence of these apps undercuts the 
small-town feel of a thriving local restaurant scene.

I have long admired the stretches of local restau-
rants just blocks from campus; even perched Pauli 
Murray College pre-pandemic, I frequently took the 
mile-long trek to the nearest restaurants, and only 
ever opened my Snackpass app late at night. A city 
full to the brim with restaurants exclusively doing 
takeout and delivery, streets abuzz with UberEats 
and DoorDash drivers, is hard to imagine. But New 
Haven is currently tipping toward that new reality.

175 Humphrey Street shows that physical loca-
tions can serve as a testament to the food that has 
been lost in the pandemic, and the food that has 
been found. But until Coffin’s proverbial snowglobe 
begins to settle, we will not know the lasting effects 
of the new takeout and delivery phenomenon. It 
is possible that physical locales will no longer be 
a part of the local restaurant scene at all, with the 
Jojo’ses and Next Doors of the city being replaced 
by restaurants focused on getting food out the door, 
rather than customers in the door. 

Coffin is keeping his options open. Although his 
co-founders have pulled out of the operation, Next 
Door still exists as a corporate shell, and Coffin is 
considering reopening post-pandemic. His decision 
may ultimately be reflective of what is to come—a 
reversion to the New Haven food scene of February 
2020, a post-pandemic reinvention of New Haven 
local dining, or something in between. 

The future of the restaurant industry is uncertain 
right now, but some losses are clear, and near to 
the heart—I will still mourn Jojo’s ginger tea every 
time I walk past the empty Chapel Street storefront. 
Out of the closures and openings and reinventions 
and adaptations will come a landscape radically 
changed from when I departed the city in March 
2020. And when I return to New Haven in August, 
I might just come across a new dining experience to 
miss while I am away.
