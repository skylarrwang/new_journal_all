Muk-muk. SKrEE! Ch ch ch ch!
The New York hardwiring kicked in; 
my muscles tensed. Slowly, with a sense of 
doom, I craned my neck to see not one, but 
three of their frantic bodies shivering above me 
on a branch. SKree! SKREE! Squirrels! 
I had reason to fear. Last December, a spate 
of squirrel attacks tore through the neighbor-
hood of Rego Park in Queens. One survivor, 
emerging from bloodstained snow, compared 
the ordeal to an MMA cage match. Another 
said her assailant would wait atop the mail-
box to harass her husband. And the threat goes 
beyond NYC—these terrorists’ reach is nation-
wide. Squirrels remain the top cause of power 
outages across America, despite utilities’ efforts 
to prevent them from gnawing into substations.
Luckily for me, I was in East Rock, and this 
particular trio was wracked by infighting. Two 
of them skittered from limb to limb, nipping 
and twisting, all the while screaming epithets 
at each other. The third ambled about placidly, 
only darting away when one of the combatants 
tried to mate with her. Occasionally their chat-
ter was punctuated by the THWUMP of snow 
tumbling from nearby roofs, or by the elm’s 
pained groan as it weathered their acrobatics. 
The battle stopped abruptly. One male 
hopped about, the female dozed, but the other 
male came near to her and, inhaling deeply, 
began to sing. Uooo. Uoooooo. My girlfriend 
Saachi and I sat down in a snowdrift to listen. 
I had never noticed how expressive their voices 
are—an eclectic mix of whines, chirps, chir-
rups, and chatters. And after a while their move-
ments, seemingly manic, began to feel like part 
of a ‘squirrel time’ with its own internal logic. 
My bottom burned from the cold. Above the 
meshed branches, a snowy owl was cutting gen-
erous circles in the blue sky. Sun on puddles. 
French fry smells from Archie Moore’s. Melt-
ing icicles sent rivulets running to the base of 
the elm, and glancing up I realized the squirrels 
had noticed me. Ch ch! Ch Ch! Two told me 
off heatedly, but as a furry rump edged out of a 
burl I could also make out, just barely, the faint 
ee of small childlike voices.

The pandemic has made human connec-
tions hard to sustain, but it’s also revealed how many 
nonhuman beings I had never noticed. Bugs, for 
instance: an average house, no matter how clean, 
is home to about 100 arthropod species. People 
don’t often think of their houses as ecosystems, 
yet as with any other there’s an intricate interplay 
between creatures of wildly different timescales 
and needs. That’s inconvenient for us humans, 
for whom ownership means sole rights—insects 
threaten the ideal of the home as a sterile place 
beyond nature. Yet leaning into that interconnec-
tion, wherever we go, can make us more empa-
thetic (and less lonely).

One night in fall, done with problem sets, I 
burst into the backyard. I cycled through happy 
dances—Erratic Hip Swing, Napoleon Dynamite, 
the Wriggle. The post-rain ground gave a moist 
squidge with each leap. Squip. Squidge. Halfway 
through my Devendra Banhart tribute dance, how-
ever, it struck me that concrete backyards aren’t 
typically squidgy. Uh oh. Sure enough, in the light 
of my phone flashlight the ground was littered 
with splattered slugs, more than a dozen of them, 
their innards glimmering Pollockly throughout the 
yard. It was their dinnertime; they had come out at 
night to eat fallen leaves and curled bugs.

It might seem ridiculous to cry over spilt slugs. 
But it struck me that my anthropocentrism wasn’t 
far from that of companies devastating the environ-
ment on a larger scale. If the damage I caused was 
less critical, it was because my feet were smaller. 
The mindset is the same: humans are alone in the 
world. “Nature,” out there, is separate from daily 
life. It’s a place to go to relax; a resource bank; 
a loose assortment of trees being chopped and 
re-planted, rivers toxified and cleaned, the whole 
earth progressing and regressing in linear lurches.

Our abuse of the planet poses a material threat 
to society and is inextricably tied to institutional 
racism and classicism. What’s at risk isn’t merely 
the future of national parks, but the ability of peo-
ple today to survive and lead healthy lives, espe-
cially BIPOC and low-income communities. And 
I’ve found that disregard for one’s surroundings, 
which enables their destruction, is also simply a 
recipe for unhappiness.

When I moved back to New Haven in January, 
I was worried it would be depressing. Last winter’s 
skies were usually gray, and I was now living far 
from campus in East Rock. But this year, spend-
ing most of the days with Saachi, things were 
different. Streets lined with seemingly-inert trees 
became a rich network of nutrient exchange with 
fungi; mother trees fed their saplings sugar, and 
young sprouts buttressed wandering wrens. A spi-
der crawled into the sink. The river froze over, and 
one night a Great Blue Heron rustled past me on 
the bridge. Crescent mushrooms poked out from 
the snow. Squirrels ran the telephone cables. 
One morning, the two of us woke up at 6 a.m. to 
drive to Hammonasset Beach State Park. It’s teem-
ing with wildlife; its sprawling salt marsh produces 
more biomass than a rainforest each year, and I was 
excited to spot some of its incredible birds. We took 
the highway for about half an hour, then pulled up 
to the entrance only to confront a roadblock and 
an imposing truck presiding over the passageway. 
I stepped out. I was wearing pants that stopped 
at my shins, and a green shirt embroidered with 
monsters. A park ranger exited the van and yawned, 
squinting at me. “You with the National Guard?” 
As it turned out, we were over an hour early. 
We drove around aimlessly to kill time, until a cop 
pulled us over because we seemed lost. So we sat 
opposite to the ranger as the sun rose. Finally, the 
gates opened and we rushed through, our excite-
ment unabated. We parked at the point and ran 
out to explore.

It was three degrees Fahrenheit. That was fine 
when I had ducked out for thirty seconds, but 
within five minutes our toes were in excruciating 
pain. The beach was deserted. A single seagull 
huddled by the toilets, skeptical. We waded into 
the grasses and tried to appreciate the brilliant sea, 
only it was much too cold for appreciating any-
thing. Shhh-phhh. The marsh laughed at us airily. 
We were fading fast, so we ran back to the car—the 
engine was frozen up. Panic. There was no heat, 
no one around, it was a rental car. Our breath 
came out in plumes. Miraculously, the car eventu-
ally started on the fifth try; we fled Hammonasset 
for the safety of home.

I collapsed on the couch when I got home, 
drained. What about being out in nature? I got up 
to lower the shades… and came face-to-face with 
a robin. It was fat and plain-looking, the squirrel 
of birds. It hopped about the dogwood tree right 
outside the window, nibbling on berries and pooping indiscriminately. But its head tilted curiously 
when I waved, and it didn’t take off. The next 
day it was back, and the next after that too. Most 
days now, it’s there outside my window—maybe it 
always was—if I remember to look.
