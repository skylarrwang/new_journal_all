The Elm City needs 130,000 vaccinations. It’s not going to 
happen without a fight.

I’m immune. I don’t leave the apartment. You 
got sick last April. We don’t know how long it’ll 
last. I won’t take it. You have a civic responsi-
bility. No, I don’t. If you don’t take it now, it’ll be 
months before you’ll have the chance again. I’ll 
live with it. 
So it was settled. My grandfather, 89, news-
savvy, sophisticated, sartorial, middle name 
Alfred, usually sweet, crippled by Covid, whose 
wife, my grandmother, died of it months before, 
refused the vaccine. There was no convincing 
him. The next day, my mother tried again. 
In New Haven, in the next days and months, 
hundreds of volunteers––organizers, clergy, stu-
dents, and doctors––will be trying to do en masse 
what my mother tried to do with my grandfather. 
They’re part of the city’s campaign to convince. 
Now that two vaccines are effective and available, 
what’s left is persuading enough people to take 
them for their efficacy to matter. 
That campaign depends on two conditions. 
First, infrastructure: having the sites––converted 
Yale gyms, parking lots, churches––having the 
personnel, and having the shots. And second, 
unburdening healthcare workers––cutting trans-
mission with masks and distance––so they can get 
out of permanent crisis mode, and onto prophy-
lactics.  
So far, the city’s opened five mass vaccination 
sites: at the City Health Department, the Fair 
Haven Community Health Clinic, and the Cor-
nell Scott Community Health Center, and in 
huge hangers like the Lanman Center and the 
Floyd Little Field House. Each shows an extraor-
dinary human effort and the problems inherent––
that, as impressive these proofs of efficiency and 
scale are, they’re only a fraction of what’s needed. 
As of this writing, New Haven has the capacity 
to vaccinate 1,100 people per week, according to 
Gage Frank, the city’s Director of Communica-
tions. And with that capacity, in the week of Feb-
ruary 3rd, as tallied in the Connecticut Depart-
ment of Health’s dataset, the city administered 
just over 900 first doses. Roughly 80 percent of 
nursing home residents, the first group eligible, 
have been vaccinated with at least one dose––past 
the threshold conferring “community immunity,” 
where the virus is buffeted from viable hosts by 
walls of inoculated ones. Close to 45 percent of 
city residents 75+ have received at least one dose 
(2,481), which ranks New Haven sixth among all 
Connecticut municipalities––still missing the 
state-wide mark, in that age group, of 53 percent. 
Achieving immunity in a city of 130,000 will 
require a pace of vaccination an order of magni-
tude faster than it’s currently moving.     
To make that possible, the city has to plan 
many thens for many ifs. If the city gets more 
than the 600 weekly vials it receives now (on top 
of its original stockpile), which it must in order 
to reach community immunity before 2023, then 
it’ll need the staff to administer them; if it has 
the staff, then it’ll need the facilities; if it has the 
facilities, then it’ll need recipients. 
But the pandemic is still raging in New Haven, 
and it isn’t immediately obvious how to meet even 
the first condition. Doctors and nurses are work-
ing 16-hour shifts. In-patient hospital services 
are at 95 percent capacity. Dr. Everett Lamm, a 
pediatrician at Fair Haven Community Health, 
told me that, even as the state’s positivity has 
plateaued at about 3.5, the rate in Fair Haven, a 
low-income neighborhood on the city’s East Side, 
has been static in the double-digits––12 percent 


or higher, on a given day.     
Two initiatives have recently 
begun lobbying state and federal 
officials to involve medical and 
pharmacy students in the vacci-
nation effort to relieve the strain 
on current staff. In mid-January, 
the National Student Response 
Network (NSRN), a coalition 
of medical, nursing, physician 
assistant, and pharmacy stu-
dents, wrote to the COVID-
19 Task Force and the Biden 
Transition Team with a direct 
appeal: “national involvement 
of health professions students is 
crucial toward addressing vac-
cination workforce shortages.” 
Those shortages run deep. For 
the average clinic, the CDC 
recommends having a 58-person 
team of medical screeners, vac-
cinators, clinical managers, EMTs, and others on 
site. On the scale required in a city of New Hav-
en’s size, that would mean reallocating a massive 
amount of hospital staff––at the moment, some-
thing the system can’t spare.  
Hirsh Shekhar, NSRN’s National Director and 
a first year at Yale’s School of Medicine, men-
tioned two precedents for student involvement 
in mass vaccination: Stanford’s Flu Crew, which 
has run seasonal campaigns since 2001, and the 
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 
which enlisted hundreds of its students as surge 
vaccinators during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 
“In any accredited pharmacy program, training 
to provide immunization is a standard part of the 
second-year curriculum,” he told me––the point 
being that nothing besides will and time is keep-
ing the 600,000 students in all health professions 
from being certified to do the same, after the stan-
dard 20 hours of training. One of NSRN’s goals 
is to broaden the success of past campus-specific 
programs––to create a sort of medical student 
reserve corps, ensuring vaccination doesn’t stall 
for lack of hands.    
The other component of NSRN’s work involves 
allaying fears and misconceptions around the vac-
cine (most often about side-effects, which show 
the immune system’s learning to fend off the 
virus; or the speed of the vaccines’ development, 
the upshot of $9 billion of federal funding, com-
pared to the $500 million to $1 billion a typical 
vaccine receives for R&D). An interdisciplinary 
partnership of medical, law, and public health 
students at Yale started a hyper-local version of 
NSRN’s framework this February. Danielle 
Miyagishima, an MD-PhD candidate at the 
School of Medicine and the project lead, 
explained that its aims are threefold: “decreasing 
the workload for overburdened health staff;” eas-
ing the “accumulation of small inconveniences,” 
like lack of insurance, time, and internet, which 
might discourage someone from registering for 
the vaccine; and having conversations, door-to-
door and on social media, to gain community 
trust. Like NSRN’s and Yale’s, any campaign 
against misinformation has to recognize its talent 
for metastasis. Doubts, like inconveniences, tend
