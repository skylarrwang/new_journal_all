What a whirlwind. Somehow an entire year has passed, made up with 365 days of blurry Zoom calls with 
talented writers, remote production weekends that spanned continents, and sleepless nights of editing. We’ve 
cherished every moment with The New Journal, and now we leave you with our final issue at the tail end of 
TNJ’s 2020-2021 managing board. 

We end with some words from our beloved editors:

Hailey Andrews—TNJ was my initial bridge into New Haven and the community that kept me tethered, both 
pre-COVID and during remote instruction. 

Elena DeBre—Writing and editing longform can be tough! But with the support, friendship, and community of 
TNJ, I felt able to take the plunge. So grateful I did. 

Meera Rothman—Editing with TNJ and joining such a kind, vibrant writing community has been one of the 
highlights of my senior year. 

Zachary Groz—In this year of separation, TNJ’s community of writers and friends kept me feeling connected to 
Yale and New Haven. 

Madison Hahamy—Working with TNJ has simply been the best. The best people, the best writing, the best 
experience. So thankful for this wonderful publication!! 

Alexandra Galloway—I’m so happy to have built friendships with the gifted writers and editors who have made 
TNJ such a wonderful community, even despite the challenges of a global pandemic. 

Nicholas Ruiz-Huidobro Magdits—My favorite thing about TNJ is that we are one of the few groups that 
actively encourages students to get to know our city! 

Jack Delaney—In a rough year, TNJ has been a source of warmth and connection for both myself and the Yale 
and New Haven community at large—thank you!

As always, enjoy reading, and stay warm.

Yours,
Candice & Helena
