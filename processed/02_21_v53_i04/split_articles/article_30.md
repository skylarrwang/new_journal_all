of the helplines, he noted that they continue to 
receive calls from families in need, even during 
the reopening process, particularly among fam-
ilies who are still learning remotely and do not 
have access to food or the necessary technology 
in school.

He insisted that the voices of parents and the 
safety of all involved are top priorities. “The com-
mon link in all of these surveys [that were sent 
out to parents] was safety. We wanted to make 
sure that the students return to a safe environ-
ment,” he stated. “The parents have always been 
involved. They’ve always been engaged.”

While the pandemic’s trajectory continues to 
shift on a daily basis, Penn and Diaz are both 
confident that the district has done as much as 
they could to ensure as much safety as possible 
in New Haven’s schools. “I hope people can see 
the effort that was there… because people can 
have confidence in the fact that a lot of smart 
people that were really committed to getting the 
kids back safely put a lot of time and effort into 
making that happen,” Penn said. 

The reopening guidelines have come after 
months of labor. Penn cites the changing guid-
ance from local health officials for this fluctu-
ation, but he also acknowledges the opportuni-
ties that came with more time. “If the project 
stops, it’s usually for a good reason,” he stated. 
“Anytime you’ve got more time available to you, 
there’s always things you can go back and do.”

Still, some feel that the work of the Reopening 
Task Force has not been enough to ensure safety 
in schools. In a letter published on Twitter on Jan-
uary 15, the New Haven Federation of Teachers 
(NHFT) called on the district to delay reopening 
until February 1 at the earliest, so more specific 
plans can be put in place. “Since last summer, 
staff and families repeatedly requested, in various 
ways and venues, system-wide guidance on infec-
tion control policies and procedures, collected 
in one single reference document, disseminated 
through system-wide training for staff, as well as 
communication with families,” the letter states. 
“It could draw from, update, and expand upon 
the preliminary work of the Tiger Team draft 
proposals last summer.” The letter was signed 
by David Cicarella, President of NHFT, along 
with representatives of other local organizations, 
including New Haven Public School Advocates 
and the Citywide Parent Team. 

Similarly, in an update posted to their website 
on January 4, 2021, Cicarella, along with Pat 
DeLucia, the Vice President of NHFT, stated 
that their organization was not informed of the 
plan to reopen until December 31, 2020, and 
that NHFT was not a part of the decision-mak-
ing process. “The decision was made by Central 
Office in conjunction with the City Building 
Department and the City Health Department.” 
The update further asserts, “There can be, and 
should be, an ongoing assessment of the data to 
determine if it remains safe to return on [January] 
19.” 

Likewise, parents and teachers presented 
mixed opinions about reopening at the Board of 
Education meeting on January 11, the first meet-
ing after the reopening date was announced.

Rebecca Cramer, a parent at L.W. Beecher 
School, submitted a public comment in support 
of reopening. “I believe that it is important to 
trust in the expertise and guidance of the New 
Haven Health Department and NHPS district 
leadership,” she wrote. She stressed that students 
still have the option to learn remotely, so parents 
who are worried about safety do not have to put 
their children at risk. “We can all work together 
to keep our community safe, but doing so can 
take different forms including through the safe 
reopening plan that NHPS has worked so hard to 
develop,” she added.

Other parents, however, had doubts. Karyn 
Smith, a parent at Elm City Montessori School, 
wrote in a comment at the meeting that she was 
concerned about forced school closures and the 
need for students and teachers to quarantine, 
which would disrupt a smooth reopening process. 
“Even if the Superintendent and Board want to 
believe only the studies that support re-opening, 
with current transmission rates, school and class-
room closures will be the norm. Rather than a 
smooth re-opening experience, students and 
families will experience frequent upheaval,” she 
argued. Smith additionally cited the emergence 
of new COVID-19 variants and higher positivity 
rates, particularly in Black and Brown communi-
ties, as reasons against reopening.

New Haven teachers also voiced their concerns 
in comments submitted to the meeting. Many of 
them noted that, at the time of reopening, teach-
ers were not yet eligible to receive their vaccines. 
“The vaccine is weeks [away], the end is near, 
please do not risk my life and additional commu-
nity spread for this charade,” Jessica Light, a third 
grade teacher at Worthington Hooker School, 
wrote. Mary McMullen, a librarian in the dis-
trict, echoed these concerns in her comment. 
“Please do the only ethical and reasonable thing, 
and delay the opening of in-person attendance 
for NHPS students until all NHPS staff (who 
choose to do so) receive the vaccine for COVID-
19,” she wrote. According to EdWeek, there have 
been at least 196 COVID-19 deaths among K-12 
school faculty in the United States, as of February 
9, 2021. 

Despite all the focus on the January reopening, 
there is still a long way to go before all students 
return to the classroom. The plan excluded stu-
dents in grades 6-12, who will continue to learn 
remotely. Edith Johnson is the principal of one 
school that is still entirely remote, Wilbur Cross 
High School in the East Rock neighborhood. 
She also served on the Instruction team of the 
Reopening Task Force.

Johnson also spoke to the challenges of remote 
learning, specifically with the abrupt halt of 
in-person learning in March. “It’s really chal-
lenging for our teachers that we asked them to 
do something really different overnight,” she 
recalled. In addition to training teachers about 
remote teaching techniques, Johnson noted 
that many students struggled with technology 
access over the past year. She cited support from 
the Dalio Philanthropies and the New Haven 
National Guard for providing and distributing 
laptops to students in need.

Still, Johnson expressed that the work is far 
from over in terms of equal access. “We need to 
continue to do those things to build equitable 
practices across our education system to make 
sure that all of our students have the same access 
to education,” she explained. 

In addition to physical resources, Johnson also 
noted the emotional toll that the pandemic has 
taken on the student body. “I don’t think there’s 
anybody in the New Haven community who has 
not been impacted by COVID,” she remarked, 
noting that many students may have either had 
COVID-19, or dealt with a family member’s ill-
ness or death. “We’re trying to provide as many 
social and emotional supports, but it’s a difficult 
thing,” she added.

This difficulty, Johnson acknowledged, can be 
attributed to some of the disconnect that comes 
with remote learning. “The majority of kids, even 
if remote is working and they’re doing well, want 
to come back to school,” she explained. She notes 
that it can often be more challenging to provide 
support, both academically and emotionally, to 
students when they are not physically in the same 
room. Additionally, in a recent meeting with stu-
dents, she learned that some of them had chal-
lenges with being on a computer for extended 
periods of time. 

At the Board of Education meeting on January 
25, some high school students submitted testi-
monies that reflected Johnson’s concerns about 
remote learning. Kiana Webber, a student at 
Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School, 
wrote, “This pandemic took so many things away 
from us, lives, happiness, the ability to freely see 
our family, and countless more, I truly hope one 
day we will get back to the way we were. I want to 
go back to school more than ever with the right 
precautions because now that I’ve been out of 
school, I truly understand the amount of happi-
ness I get from attending school and seeing my 
friends.” 

Of course, Johnson also recognized the spe-
cific concerns that high school students are being 
deprived of the authentic high school experience. 
“I specifically talk about our ninth graders and 
our seniors,” she said. “They all have that true 
senior or freshman experience that they’re miss-
ing out on.” With prom, graduation, and athletic 
events still up in the air, Johnson recognizes the 
added pressure she faces as a high school princi-
pal, but she is hopeful that the school community 
can keep moving forward. “We have a lot of Cross 
pride, and we’re Cross strong, and we’re going to 
figure it out,” she asserted. “And we’re going to 
do the best that we can for our students and our 
staff.”

Johnson, Penn, and Diaz all offered different 
perspectives of how the pandemic has uniquely 
affected their jobs and their plans for the school 
year, but they also offered similar conclusions—
despite the uncertainty of the pandemic and the 
pushback that the district has faced, they have 
confidence in the precautions that the district is 
taking, and they hope parents will be too. 

Johnson reasserted her faith in the efficacy and 
safety of the reopening, but hedged that the plan 
wouldn’t appease all parents, students, and staff 
involved. “We’re not going to please everyone,” 
she acknowledged, “but we recognize that our 
kids do need to be in school.” 

Time will tell if the reopening plan is effec-
tive enough to keep students and faculty safe, and 
if the students at Wilbur Cross and other high 
schools in New Haven are able to return to a 
modified but memorable high school experience. 
But after almost a year, the seeds of returning to a 
somewhat normal education have been planted. 

Johnson recalled a scene at Clinton Avenue 
School, where she offered help in welcoming stu-
dents, on reopening day, of the young elementary 
students getting off the bus, clad in masks featur-
ing cartoon characters and superheroes. Despite 
all the turbulence of the past year, and all the 
precautions that are still in place, one thing was 
clear—they were happy to be back.
