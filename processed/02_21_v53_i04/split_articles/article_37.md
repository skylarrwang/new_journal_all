EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
berg compares writing to a meditation. Through 
the practice of it, the steady ritual, a writer learns 
to trust herself. The practice of sitting down every 
day, of filling stacks of notebooks with scribbles 
that will never be published is a practice in self-
trust, in mind-body synchronicity. 

“It is undirected and has to do with all of you 
right in your present moment,” she writes. “Think 
of writing practice as loving arms you come to 
illogically and incoherently. It’s our wild forest 
where we gather energy before going to prune 
our garden...It’s a continual practice.”

Like Murakami, Goldberg identifies the 
incredible similarity between writing and run-
ning. In fact, she finds them similar to any other 
immersive practice. Running could be subbed 
out for dancing, praying, mindful walking.

I stand in front of my dormitory bathroom mir-
ror, brushing my teeth. The brush makes little 
foams of toothpaste on each tooth, a coating to be 
swished away with water. I try to empty my mind. 

I have read six of Murakami’s books and doz-
ens of his short stories. I even taped a picture of 
him to my wall at home last winter break. My 
printer was jammed, so I went to the FedEx near 
my house and asked for the cashier’s help to print 
on off-white cardstock for an extra 99 cents. We 
watched together as the paper emerged from the 
printer – materializing, inch by inch, the over-
inked image of an old man running. 
“Who is that dude?” the cashier asked me. 
I told him and he asked if I read a lot and 
where I went to school. I think he may have been 
flirting with me but I’m not sure.

I’ve been noticing lately the way Murakami 
portrays women in his books. His stories are usu-
ally about a solitary male protagonist embarking 
on a mystical journey. On that journey, women 
are objects of mystery, vessels for the protagonist 
to liberate himself sexually, and accomplices to 
guide him towards clarity at the end of the novel. 
I know this because I did a deep-dive into all the 
Internet criticism one night. 

I wish I hadn’t, though, because it makes me 
feel weird every time I look at the picture on 
my wall. Murakami’s gait looks steady, and his 
expression is earnest, like he is seeking something 
far off on the horizon. Even when I took down all 
the other pictures, I still left his up. 

These days, I run sometimes. I joined the club 
swim team at school, and we practice two nights 
every week. I lose myself following the speckled 
blue line on the pool’s floor, comforted to hear 
the splashes of my teammates in the lanes beside 
me. I walk home from the gym at ten o’clock, my 
hair dripping a cool stream down my back, and 
turn the shower to the hottest it goes.      

At home, I run side-by-side with my dad, 
pounding our feet in rhythm along the road. We 
rarely talk about what running means to us these 
days – it is too much, like drawing the ocean with 
a Crayola box – and yet I know that running is 
both of our crucibles, no longer pure magic for 
me, but still worshipped in the depths of our 
innermost minds.

Sometimes, when I am feeling – confused, 
alone, brave – I set off by myself. I don’t venture 
too far off campus, at most a mile in any direc-
tion, before the houses become sparse and the 
blue-light boxes stop. When I return, I spread 
my arms wide, no matter how many people are 
around to see.

Running as a reckoning. As a way 
of pleading with God and being 
answered, with my life, again and 
again and again.
