hen I’m missing New Haven, my mind turns 
to late-night pizza and ramen, or chai lattes 
hurriedly consumed in the cold. In my nostalgia, my 
thoughts linger on the spaces that provide such deli-
cacies—the late-night fluorescent glow of Est Est Est 
punctuated by laughing students, or the ice-cold air that 
hits my face as I struggle with the door of the York Street 
Blue State, chaider in tow. But recently, I realized with 
some alarm that I was conjuring up places and situa-
tions that no longer exist. Sitting in my childhood bed-
room, where I have spent the duration of the pandemic, 
I often think about sipping tea in Jojo’s Coffee, even as 
307 miles away, the corner of Chapel and Park Street 
stands vacant. 

The pandemic has scarred the restaurant scene in 
New Haven, prompting a turnover unlike any other 
in the last few decades. Around 600 restaurants have 
closed in Connecticut since March of last year, and 
New Haven, in particular, has witnessed the closings of 
city favorites such as Jojo’s and Duc’s Place. However, 
new restaurants such as Ahava Vegan and Haven Hot 
Chicken have risen, sometimes in the same storefronts. 
The industry itself has been transformed, successful 
restaurants shifting their focus to takeout and delivery, 
rather than in-person dining. When the pandemic ends, 
and the city’s streets revive, New Haven residents will 
find a vastly different food scene than existed in Febru-
ary 2020. 

One restaurant in particular encapsulates the chaos 
the industry has witnessed over the last few months. 
Next Door opened in 2017 at 175 Humphrey Street, in 
a standalone brick building in the shadow of Highway 
91 that once housed a prohibition-era speakeasy. The 
restaurant was founded by three veterans of the New 
Haven food scene, one of whom, Doug Coffin, owns 
a pizza catering business that operates just down the 
street—hence the name Next Door. Coffin described 
the restaurant to me as a combination of pizzeria and 
upscale dining locale, with chef Robin Bodak con-
stantly experimenting with innovative dishes and craft 
beer to go along with no-fuss pizza. 

When Next Door closed in August due to the pan-
demic-related financial pressures, Coffin expanded his 
successful catering business—Big Green Truck Pizza—
into the space at 175 Humphrey. 

During one of Coffin’s late-night shifts at Big Green 
Truck Takeout, Coffin recalled to me over the shouts 
of his cooking staff in the background how he got his 
start in the New Haven food scene, and its evolution 
in recent years. He spoke with a knowledge that could 
only come with decades of experience in New Haven 
restaurants, referencing local restaurant owners and 
chefs by their first names.“The pandemic is rewriting 
the restaurant scene,” he told me, his voice rising over 
the din around him. “I’m glad that people are paying 
attention.” 

Coffin attended Yale College in the early 1970s, but 
dropped out because he wanted to be a part of the social 
movements that had characterized much of the late 
’60s. Laughing, he told me that by the time he arrived 
on the scene, the only social-justice oriented movement 
he could find in New Haven was the New Haven food 
co-op, a community organizing project which provided 
residents with healthy, cheap food. So that is where 
Coffin went. The co-op eventually went bankrupt, but 
Coffin decided to stay in the culinary business. After 
striking out a number of times, he developed a catering 
business that morphed into Big Green Truck Pizza.
For the past 15 years, Big Green Truck Pizza has 
catered all over Connecticut in its fleet of—you guessed 
it—big green trucks, which double as travelling pizze-
rias outfitted with wood-fired brick ovens. During the 
pandemic, the business lost around half of its sales, no 
longer able to cater large gatherings or school events.
