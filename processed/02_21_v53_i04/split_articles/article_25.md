The Sandal
and the Star
A personal essay by Sanya Nair
I 
was seven years old when I went to India for the 
first time. Now, at eighteen, I don’t remember 
much from that trip, only snippets: the hot weather, 
the taste of fresh lychee and rambutan, meeting 
family members, and—much to my mother’s dis-
may—forgetting most of their names the following 
day. Hints of a life I may have lived if my parents 
hadn’t moved to the States that have since blurred 
with time. What I do remember is losing my shoe 
on the side of a mountain. 
I am Hindu by birth. My parents practice the 
faith. My brother and I do so nominally—mak-
ing occasional trips to the nearest Hindu temple 
in Delaware, repeating phrases in Malayalam to 
praise Gods we barely know.
This isn’t to say I don’t believe in Hinduism. It’s 
just that I’ve already reached my spiritual peak, 
when I was seven years old, hiking up a mountain 
to reach a temple dedicated to the Lord Ayyappa, 
alongside my brother, dad, and uncle.
