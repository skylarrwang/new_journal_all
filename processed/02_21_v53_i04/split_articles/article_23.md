Jockey’s Ridge State Park
Auguste White
Walking on the beach felt like kissing a Boy Scout
Suddenly in a fine little beard of thin grasses
And then a moment later back in the sand 
The dunes were the entire world
Maybe there was sea somewhere but also
Maybe there wasn’t. And this blessed us because 
my grandmother is afraid of water and cannot go near 
splendor
Our footprints were only loosely translated in the sand
And there was nothing to suggest 
That this land had ever known water 
There was only dry wind and chapped blue sky 
There is a coin telescope on the boardwalk
So you can look out and 
Read the same sentence as many times as you want
