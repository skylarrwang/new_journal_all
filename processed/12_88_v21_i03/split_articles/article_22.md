beings and outside them. 

This parallel provides a justification 
for those who rush from religious 
services 
to 
meet 
their afternoon 
psychoanalyst appointment. 

Both 
psychoanalysis and religion set out to 
reveal, but they reveal different things. 
Psychoanalysis uncovers the 
indi-
vidual's unconscious while religion 
reveals the existence of God. Leavy's 
Christian premise, that man is in the 
image of God, allows him to diminish 
the initial difference between these 
revelations. Psychoanalysis, unmask-
ing man, will simultaneously unmask 
God. Leavy's argument is circular. All 
of his musings return to his one central 
tenet. 

For those who object to Leavy's 
initial assertion of faith, In the Image of 
God may seem superfluous. Does the 
Christian basis limit its relevance or 
ignore non-believers? In the sixth 
chapter, "Believing," Leavy explicitly 
addresses 
the many non-religious 
people interested in psychoanalysis. 
These people probably comprise a 
majority of his readers, since so many 
educated people today are not reli-
gious. Leavy provides a belated but 
provocative psychoanalytic inter-
pretation of this state of affairs. He 
relates the departure from faith to the 
movement from 
a 
chi ldhood 
dependency on one's parents towards 
independence and sexual maturity. 
Ironically, Leavy's Christianity 
becomes alienating only in addressing 
non-believers, when he attributes the 
current spiritual passivity to fashion. 
The book, however, will leave a 
powerful impression upon non· 
religious people who are interested in 
spiritual questions. Those seeking a 
complex interpretation of Christianity 
or psychoanalysis will be disappointed; 
those who can appreciate statements 
such as "To accomplish our desires we 
need to love and be loved ," will be 
rewarded. 

Leavy does not attempt to construct 
rigorously 
logical argument 
mapped with irreproachable ration· 
ality. Instead his thoughts take the 
form of reflection. The chapters could 
be read in almost any order without 
distorting his message. Each chapter 
was originally one of a series of lectures 
presented recently at Christ Church in 
New Haven to an audience that did 
not have extensive knowledge of 
psychoanalytic theory. Leavy avoided 
jargon-laden language, consciously 
risking oversimplification in order to 
ensure comprehensibility. 

In his 
introduction, he forewarns the reader 
of this danger. Had Leavy explicated 
each assertion, 
he would have 
diminished the fluidity of his work, 
potentially burdening the contents 
with recapitulations of complex 
Freudian theories. 
But at 
times, 
unsubstantiated 
statements do leave unanswered 
questions. 
These 
frustrating 
conceptual gaps point to the book's 
most serious problem: the vastness of 
the subjects. 
Leavy's discussions 
concern the nebulous spaces called 
heaven and the unconscious. Because 
he wishes to avoid complex ter· 
minology, his philosophizing some·
times culminates in statements that 
seem vacuous. Groping with issues as 
broad as life results in Leavy's constant, 
and insensitive, references to "man." 
This oversimplification 
belies his 
extensive experience as a psycho· 
analyst and the serious scholarship 
beneath his book . 

Despite the grandiose nature of the 
subject matter, In the Image of God is 
nt:ither self-righteous nor dogmatic. 
Leavy offers his basic life truths 
but does not trumpet his Christian 
conviction. The slim volume skips 
from 
psychoanalytic to Christian 
concepts, treating each with equal 
skepticism. 
Leavy uses the Bible 
sparingly and quotes from diverse 
10urces. His extensive notes at the 
conclusion of each chapter include 
everyone from Augustine to Noam 
Chomsky. Leavy skillfully interweaves 
W.H. 
Auden's poetry, bits of 
Heidegger's philosophy, and Aquinas' 
theology. 

M ediating between God and Freud, 
Leavy 
reveals the possibility of 
accepting a belief in both psycho-
analytic and Christian claims through 
a divine understanding of humankind. 
He takes basic aspects of human 
existence, such as love, death, and 
suffering, 
and asks what these 
experiences really are. In the I'fTIIJlt of 
God maintains that both psychoanalytic 
theory and Christianity answer this 
question, and that one system cannot 
be helpful without the other. Un-
questioned faith has little value in 
easing human experience, just as the 
most rigorous psychoanalysis cannot 
replace faith while ignoring that •any 
person is indeed made in God's image, 
Warts and all. •
