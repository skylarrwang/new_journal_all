Most faculty members who get pregnant 
don't push for paid childcare 
leaves. "Almost no one has tested the 
system," said Mary Miller, tenured 
associate professor in the History of 
Art department and mother of one. 
•Jt•s a kind of internalized pressure," 
Wicke said. "You look around, and 
everybody has done it without causing 
anybody any trouble. And you feel 'I 
should probably do that, too.'" 

Even ifjunior faculty members were 
to agitate for change, they have limited 
political clout. Effective complaints 
need to come from the tenured faculty. 
Yet while women composed 30 percent 
of the entire faculty in 1987-88, only 
7.8 percent had tenure. "The critical 
mass of tenured women that can make 
demands is small," Miller pointed out. 
Their dearth in numbers and a general 
COmpliance to the University's schedule 
give Yale little incentive 
tO 
change. "The University is spared the 
real onset of the problem because 
people are 
so self-disciplined," 
Brodhead said. "People always manage 
to have their babies on June 1st or 
during fellowship leaves." 

Not all professors bow to the will of 
the University. Margaret Ferguson 
was one of the first tenured women to 
point out Yale's deficient maternity 
policy. She left Yale in part because 
Columbia offered her a full term of 
paid maternity leave. When Ferguson 
considered accepting her new appointment, she approached the Yale 
administration with a request to match 
Columbia's offer. The administration 
argued that a paid maternity leave 
discriminates against childless faculty 
members. The Provost reasoned that 
faculty taking paid parenting leaves 
might use part of their time to conduct 
research and write, which would disadvantage 
the 
instructors 
without 
children. Miller quickly counters such 
logic. "The semester you have a baby, 
you really don't get a lot else done," she 
said. 

~In fact, you dream of sleep. 
You're not dreaming about getting 
your research done."
