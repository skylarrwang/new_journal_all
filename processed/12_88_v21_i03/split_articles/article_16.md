intended to alienate the community, 
but rather to convey their seriousness 
and dedication. "When you're on line, 
you're on a mission," said Lucas. "So 
you try to have this look in your eye 
that nothing can get in the way of this 
mission." 

Some people have found this a hard 
line to tow. Of the 33 people who have 
pledged the Zeta chapter since 1983, 
five have quit. Marland Chancellor 
(BK '89) went on line last spring with 
only one other Sphinxman, who 
dropped after two days. This left 
Chancellor to go it alone. fie became 
responsible for fulfilling the tasks of all 
14 brothers, one of whom owned over 
30 pairs of shoes and made Chancellor 
shine them regularly. "It put a greater 
emotional strain on me. I had no one 
to turn to, no one to joke with, no one 
to watch my back." He dropped line 
after 15 days. 

Chancellor found pledging phy-
sically and mentally exhausting and 
dreaded running into an Alpha on the

studies as a biology major. "I had to go 
up to Science Hill, and none of the 
brothers would be up there," he said, 
smiling. "It was a great incentive to go 
to class. rd stay up there all day." 

He respects the principles under-
lying the pledge process, but doesn't 
think that a one-person line serves 
their ends. "The purpose of the line is 
to draw you all closer. You're a unit. I 
wasn't drawing closer to anybody, 
certainly not to the brothers who w~re 
putting me through it," he said. He 
shook his head as he compared his 
experience with that of this year's 
pledges. "Outnumbering the brothers 
must be a comfortable feeling." 

Edward Morrow (YC '31), the oldest 
living black Yalie, pledged alone under 
different circumstances in 
1927. 

Graduate students had filled the ranks 
since the fraternity's inception, and 
they were desperate for undergraduate 
members. When Morrow transferred 
from the University of South Dakota, 
he 
was one of only four black
