Letters 
To the Editors, 
I was almost moved to tears by Brent 
Robbins' When Riglu Is Incorrect (TN], Oc-
tober 21, 1988). What a terrible picture 
he paints! Now I know that he or she is 
brave and pathetic, bloody but unbowed, 
part of a scorned and reviled minority 
"embattled" in an overwhelming surge of 
rampant liberalism. 

Take me seriously, now: my main 
praise for TN] has always been for its 
lack of bias. Its contributors seem (or 
seemed) to make an effort to present as 
many sides of an issue as possible, and to 
apologize for any lack of information. 
Robbins, in his whining self-pity, is guilty 
of precisely that fault which he attributes 
to those ruthless, thoughtless liberals: He 
fails to fully understand his opponent's 
position. In fact, the "opponent" he rails 
against is so vast and vague that it would 
be impossible for anyone to understand 
it. He lumps all conceivably liberal 
groups and individuals into one amor-
phous category, and damns them all. 

It would be· petty and immensely bor-
ing for me to launch into a detailed 
criticism of Robbins' statement, so I will 
make only two more points. First, in the 
recent election the United States of 
America proved itself staunchly conser-
vative and comfortably in line with 
everything Robbins believes those teem-
ing liberals are trying to jeopardize. Se-
cond, except in ferociously communist 
regimes, "conservatives" are not and 
never have been persecuted. If Robbins 
thinks he and his fellows are being 
treated unfairly, I can only respond with 
derision and scorn that I have never 
heard anything so ridiculously childish in 
my entire life. When he graduates and 
leaves the sequestered cloisters of the 
University he will probably realize that in 
what is laughingly known as "the real 
world" he is no longer a member of a 
minority. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth Wein (SM '86)
