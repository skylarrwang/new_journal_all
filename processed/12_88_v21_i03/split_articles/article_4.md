Letter of Commendation 
Two veterans stood in the crowd on 
New Haven's Long Wharf, waiting for 
a chance to approach the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial and pay their 
respects to a friend killed in the war. 
When they saw each other- the first 
·time in almost 20 years- they em-
braced for several minutes. An older 
couple placed a red carnation at the 
base of the 14-foot, V -shaped marble 
memorial, which was engraved with 
the names of 55 men lost in Vietnam. 
One was their son. Veterans and the 
family members of those killed in 
action made up most of the audience at 
the emotional ceremony to dedicate the 
newly-erected monument. The New 
Haven Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
Committee, which had started 
planning the monument four years 
before, finally saw the positive effect of 
its work. "This is necessary for the 
healing 
process," 
said Howard 
Chernikoff, one of the committee's 
founders. 

Inspired by the growing number of 
Vietnam memorials nationwide, 
Chernikoff and a 
fellow 
veteran, 
Conley Monk, began working in 1983 
to build a monument in New Haven. 
Chernikoff and 
Monk quickly 
recruited five others, and together they 
formed the memorial committee. None 
of the committee members had had 
experience organizing such a large 
project. When they first proposed their 
plan, they were met with skepticism. 
According to Chernikoff, "Those city 
officials didn't think that we could do 
it." In 1984, the committee showed the 
.'City its design for the memorial and 
proposed Long Wharf as a possible 
site. It knew it had won the city's 
approval when a section of Long 
Wharf was renamed the Vietnam 
Veterans War Memorial Park. After 
hard lobbying, the committee also 
received four loans of $12,000 apiece 
from the city of New Haven and its 
ol The New Journal/Decernber 2 , 1988 
neighbors. 

Next came the hardest part of the 
committee's work. For two years, it 
searched the cities' records and found 
the names of the 53 local men killed in 
action and 2 missing in action. The 
committee lasted through this arduous 
process, and in early November, a 
crowd including Representative Bruce 
Morrison and New H aven Mayor 
Biagio DiLieto attended the dedication 
ceremony. 

The ceremony, honoring their lost 
friends and family members, drew 
almost 400 people in the midst of a 
downpour, a testimony to the com-
mittee's success in healing at least some 
wounds of the war. A few people 
speculated on the meaning of the "V" 
itself. "People believe it stands for 
different things: 
victory, veterans, . 
Vietnam," said Chernikoff. "I like 
valor. But for everyone, you just have 
to measure it from your heart and go 
from there." People left the dedication 
site, glad that their loved ones had 
finally been honored. But not all of the 
veterans who served in the Vietnam 
war had received recognition. 

The committee's next project will be 
to honor the soldiers who survived that 
war. Committee members hope · to 
engrave the names of the 3,000 living 
Vietnam veterans from the New 
Haven area on another wall at the 
memorial site. In an unprecedented 
decision, the committee will include 
soldiers with other than honorable 
disch arges. In the past, 
public 
memorials have only included the 
names of honorably discharged 
veterans. 

But, 
according to 
Chernikoff, the committee departed 
from this practice because its members 
felt 
that the 
military 
unfairly 
discharged some soldiers. Many were 
dishonorably gischarged for drug use, 
a past policy now in review. When this 
new monument is finally built, the 
committee will have recorded history 
as well as made it.
