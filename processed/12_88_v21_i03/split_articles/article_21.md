Reconcilable Differences 
In. the Image of God, by Stanley A. Leavy, 
Yale Universi9' Press (New Havm and 
London: 1988) 117.95, 128 pages. 

Freud fetishes abound. Yale's course 
catalogue lists no fewer than 15 classes 
that include either Freud or psycho-
analysis in their description. Hundreds 
of students absorb psychoanalytic 
theory via philosophy, literature, and 
literary 
theory, 
not to mention 
psychology. Freud occupies an undis-
puted position in the academic canon, 
but some students also encounter his 
theories directly 
by undergoing 
psychoanalysis. Whether or not we 
agree with psychoanalytic theory, it 
has so infused our culture that we 
perceive the world largely through 
Freudian terms. Freud's pen has 
replaced the hand of God in explaining 
the unexpected and irrational. But are 
religious conviction and a psycho-
analyti_c;: perspective incompatible? In 
Dr. - Stanley Leavy's book 
In 
the 
ITMge of God: A Psychoanalyst's View, he 
maintains that these two systems of 
belief can coexist. 

Leavy's central assertion appears in 
large, white letters on the cerulean blue 
cover: Human beings embody the 
image of God. At a casual glance, the 
book seems to be a theological treatise. 
Only small, almost invisible gray type 
indicates 
that the book gives a 
psychoanalyst's view. The jacket 
design is revealing. Leavy writes from

distinctly Christian perspective, 
rather than with the distance of a 
modern skeptic. Non-Christians must 
temporarily accept Leavy's religious 
premise in order to see any value in his 
project. If they do so, the book offers 
insightful 
commentaries about the 
relation between belief and psycho-
analysis. 

Although he agrees with facets of the 
psychoanalytic interpretation of 
religious experience, Leavy ultimately 
finds Freud's theories incomplete. In 
particular, he questions the definition 
of religion as the 
imagination's 
response to unfulfilled desires. He also 
disputes the psychoanalytic reduction 
of religious experience to classifiable 
mental phenomena. Freud's "psychic 
determinism," explaining all psychic 
experience in terms of early devel-
opment, limits unconscious activity to 
a repetition of the past. This view of 
human experience cannot account for 
contact 
with God. Leavy equally 
distrusts 
the common Christian 
responses to Freud. These range from 
a blunt denunciation of Freudian 
theories, to line-by-line exegeses of 
psychoanalytic texts, "with the earnest 
intention of demonstrating how they 
can be fitted with Christian meaning." 

Leavy's own method avoids both 
extremes. Each chapter of his book 
focuses upon either an emotional state 
or existential idea. Their titles, such as 
"Becoming" and "Suffering," are 
reminiscent of seventies psycho-pop 
slogans. The chapter "Loving and 
Hating" demonstrates Leavy's way of 
handling these enormous themes. He 
pits the Christian view of love as the 
philosophical source of principled 
action against the psychoanalytic view 
of love as altruism motivated by sexual 
desire. He searches for the middle 
ground. Leavy specifically objects to 
the Christian emphasis on virginity, 
which has made sexlessness an aspect 
of perfection. Here Leavy finds the 
psychoanalytic 
perspective more 
enlightening, 
for it uncovers the 
potency and omnipresence of sexuality 
in love. But he also argues with the 
way Freud uses classical mythology, 
particularly the Oedipus and Narcissus 
myths, as paradigms for love. The 
psychoanalytic interpretations of these 
myths have reduced love to a set of 
formulaic relationships. 

Ultimately, 
Leavy illuminates the point at which 
Freudian and Christian ideas about 
love merge: Both psychoanalysis and 
religion explicitly or implicitly state 
"that love for others is preferable to 
love for oneself." 

The book does more than simply 
outline overlapping areas. Leavy seeks 
a coherent alternative to the traditional 
dualism of psychoanalysis and reli-
gion. The chapter entitled "Con-
cealing" achieves this union most 
effectively. Leavy believes that human 
beings are "concealing and distorting 
by nature, as well as loving, hating, 
striving, creating beings." People 
continually disguise themselves, and 
psychoanalysis breaks down the dis-
guises. Leavy views the discovery of 
the self through psychoanalysis as 
parallel to the Christian effort to see a 
God revealed both within human
