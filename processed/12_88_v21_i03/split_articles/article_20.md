should we be willing to pay for that? If 
that's going to cost X amount of dol-
lars, is that the right place to deliver 
those dollars?" The answers to these 
questions don't come easily. Even if the 
administration agrees with the prin-
ciples of a paid parenting leave, the 
Budget Committee must determine if 
it · is affordable. "There's no question 
that a semester's leave with pay would 
·be a big help and an attractive benefit, 
and I'm sure it would be widely used," 
Long said. "But it would be a very 
expensive 
benefit to offer." How 
expensive? Long doesn't know. He 
anticipates that the University will 
assess parenting issues in its 1989-90 
budget considerations. 

But having no solid parenting leave 
may also be expensive for Yale. To

avoid losing professors like Margaret 
Ferguson, the University must be able 
to compete with other schools. Without 
an improved program, Yale could 
compromise the strength of its faculty. 
"Even if Yale saves a few dollars, I 
think they do themselves no favors," 
Miller said. 

Even 
though 
Yale's 
financial constraints are real, the 
Economic Report on the Status of the 
Faculty pointed out that other uni-
versities operating on budgets similar 
to Yale's have managed to take bigger 
steps in parenting policies. 

Margaret Ferguson's current em-
ployer, Columbia University, grants a 
six-month paid maternity leave with 
an option of an additional six months 
at two-thirds pay. Cornell University 
guarantees one month of maternity 
• leave with full pay, and up to six 
~ months of leave, also at full pay, with 
11: the pr'lvost's approval. Many uni-
~ versities offer paid maternity leaves in 
~ addition to a pausing of the tenure 
l clock. 

Other schools have ma~aged to cir-
j cumvent parental leaves, yet still 
~ accommodate family needs. Under a 
new policy instituted by the University 
of California (UC) system, the tenure 
clock will stop for faculty members 
who request time to take care of 
family, even if they don't take a leave. 
A full-
or part-time instructor can 
extend the pre-tenure period as much 
as a year without having to take unpaid 
time off. These extensions apply to 
aging parent care, illness in the family, 
or any familial obligations, including 
newborn childcare. Without granting a 
term's paid leave, UC acknowledges 
financial contraints that can prohibit a 
faculty member from taking a non-
salaried leave. 

As many faculty members indicate, 
even ifYale revised its policies to bring 
them more in line with other schools', 
the years following a child's infancy 
would remain unaddressed. Once the 
child is born, Yale faculty must strug-
gle to find daycare. "Daycare is a much 
deeper and broader question about 
what is the appropriate role for the 
University in childcare," Long said. 

Yale does 
provide space for six 
privately incorporated daycare faci-
lities; only two of them offer infant 
care. But competition to enroll a child 
into any one of these facilities forces 
most families to search outside of Yale, 
and even outside of New Haven. Since 
Yale does not subsidize the tuition of 
these centers, .Jhe cost of daycare, 
ranging from three to five thousand 
dollars for a ten-month period, strains an 
academic's limited resources. 

According to Long, Yale would like 
to assist with some form of childcare, 
but the expense prohibits it. Yet the 
University does help parents of older 
children, after their kids have left the 
playpen and are ready for college. Yale 
will pay half the tuition of the insti-
tution chosen by a faculty member's 
child, up to $5,450 a year. The Uni-

What course the 
administration 
will take in the next few years as 
women gain a stronger voice on the 
faculty and men figure more noticeably 
into parental 
politics remains to 
be seen. "The next step would involve 
faculty making strong ~ recommend-
ations within their departments. It 
might have to start in a grass-roots 
kind of way," Wicke said. On the way 
an 
ideal 
policy, 
parents and 
administrators must 
make com-
promises. Instead of asking for a full 
semester leave with pay, perhaps 
faculty will settle for a well-defined six-
week maternity leave- backed by Uni-

ments- part-time appointments, and

flexible teaching schedules during the 
term of childbirth. Finding a well-
suited policy for a situation that varies 
from individual to individual presents 
a challenge to the University. The 
nature of academia is that difficulty 
comes with the territory. "I don't really 
foresee the day when it will be possible 
to hold 
a 
high-prestige, 
high-
achievement job, where it is totally 
easy to devote yourself to the raising of 
your children at the same time," 
Richard Brodhead said. "I think it's a 
little unfair to expect the University to 
solve the problems of modern human 
life. But that's not to say I think they 
shouldn't be responsible to try."
