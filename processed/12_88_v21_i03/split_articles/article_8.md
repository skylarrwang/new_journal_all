Between the Vines/Julie Hantman 
Out of Focus 
I threaded my way to a seat in the 
back, late as usual. I sat down with my 
family, welcomed by friend's waves 
and the rustling of prayer book pages. 
As always, I was glad to be home for 
Rosh Hashanah services. Yet when 
Rabbi Louis Sigel (SM '45, GRD '46) 
started his sermon, I was unprepared 
for- his words. Invoking images of 
empty evening classes and poorly at-
tended Sabbath services, he chastised 
each of us for becoming what he called 
"the ignorant Jew." I glanced down at 
my prayer book, which for years had 
spoken for me in familiar yet incom-
prehensible Hebrew. Although I had 
celebrated holidays for so long, I had 
learned no more 
about them. 

Ten days later, I attended Yale's 
Yom Kippur services at Dwight Cha-
pel. Rabbi James Po net (TO '68) gave 
a sermon entitled "Shall We Build a 
Hillel House?" in which he confronted 
the assembled students, faculty, and 
community members with Yale Jewry's 
"corporate invisibility." Only weeks 
before, New Haven Architect Harold 
Roth (GRD '57) had finished plans for 
a Hillel House, a Jewish center for 
religious, 
cultural, and social 
activities to be built on High Street. 
Six years of discussion with Ponet had 
produced a design for a five-story 
building, which when finished would 
cost $8 million. Insufficient finances 
and fears 
of ghettoization 
have 
continued to delay the process. 

Meanwhile, Jewish life on campus 
remains unfocused. Although 30 percent 
of Yale College is Jewish, few Jews 
practice their religion regularly, and 
few actively explore their cultural 
heritage. Rabbi Ponet was calling for a 
facility that would muster Jewish 
resources, 
attract broader par-
ticipation, and galvanize the Jewish 
community. A Hillel House would 
provide a chance for personal and 
academic research. In a collegiate 
setting such as Yale's, these goals are 
appropriate. 

Opportunities do·exist on campus to 
explore different aspects of Judaism. 
Over the last decade, Yale has de-
veloped an acclaimed Judaic Studies 
program, attracting visiting scholars 
from around the world. When I en-
tered Yale, 
I 
intended to take 
advantage of the department's. 
interdisciplinary offerings. Yet each 
year I crossed them off my list, in favor 
of cour_ses like "The Victorian Novel" 
and "Elementary 
Portugese." Last 
semester a v1siting professor offered 
what was essentially a history of my 
ancestors, "TheJewish Community in 
Poland-Lithuania 1500-1800." But I 
didn't take it- perhaps deterred by the 
thought of cramming for an exam in 
"Identity 101." 

Professor 
David Ruderman, an 
historian and ordained rabbi, offers a 
course called "Jewish Intellectual 
History in the Modern Era," which 
deals with issues of contemporary 
Jewish faith and 
identity. "The 
material is so rich, so pregnant with 
meaning, it affects Jews and non-Jews 
alike," Ruderman said. In last spring's 
class, however, 
Ruderman fielded 
questions from the Jewish students of a 
volume and intensity he had rarely 
experienced. Although 
pleased to 
respond to the wide range of queries, 
at some point Ruderman had to stick 
to his role as academician. "Pve got to 
draw the line somewhere," Ruderman 
said. "That's where Hillel comes in." 

Professor Paula Hyman, chairwoman 
of the Judaic Studies Advisory Com-
mittee, 
explained, 
"The 
academic 
program is not defined to meet the 
cultural and religious needs of Jewish 
students. Judaic Studies is an aca-
demic address." 

But the social, cultural, and reli-
gious needs of Jewish students have 
numerous addresses: There are as 
many locations as there are groups. 
Orthodox services take place in the 
Branford College Chapel, and Reform 
services use the Branford Mendell 
Room. According to Abby Bernstein 
(PC '92), who leads song for the 
Reform services, each service 
competes with the bells ringing in 
Harkness 
tower. 
Reform Jewish 
Students at Yale holds its meetings in a 
Trumbull seminar room. And non-
credit classes in Yiddish, Arabic, and 
Introduction to Judaism are offered in 
Phelps 
Hall 
or 
in 
Rabbi 
Ponet's basement. The only permanent 
address for these and other events is 
underground, at B004 Bingham-a 
few small offices with exposed ceiling 
pipes. From here the B'nai B'rith Hillel 
Foundation at Yale coordinates under-
graduate and graduate organizations, 
three denominational ser.vices, 
lectures, and social functions. With 
piles of mailings and books in every 
corner, it can hardly accommodate the 
few people who use it. 

The only specifically Jewish place 
where Jews can gather is also under-
ground: The student-run Kosher Kit-
chen operates underneath the Film 
Studies Department on Crown Street. 

When my rabbi from home entered 
Yale in 1941 , during a period of overt 
anti-Semitism, there were no means to 
keep kosher on campus. Since the· 
University made no provisions for 
Jewish customs, he was forced to 
improvise. The Dean of Freshmen 
reminded him, "Yale did not look for 
you. You looked for Yale." In 1962, 
reports Dan Oren in joining the Club: A 
History of Jews and Yale, 
a Yale 
freshman, who graduated from the 
modem Orthodox Yeshiva of Flat-
bush, New York, became the first 
undergraduate to buy a dining con-
tract at the Kosher Kitchen. "By the 
mid-60's, members of the Kosher 
Kitchen wer:e traveling back to their 
high schools . . . to recruit more 
applicants," Oren writes. "The 
reputation that Yale had once shared 
with Princeton of being hostile to Jews 
began to fade into memory." But 
today, the Flatbush Yeshiva encour-
ages its alumni to attend Princeton, 
which boasts a popular kosher eating 
club run by the university. Yale's 
student-run Kosher Kitchen can 
barely support itself on its dwindling 
membership; to meet expenses, 
student officers have to depend on 
bagel brunches to pay their bills. 

Eric Fisher (SY '92) is the only active 
freshman in the Kosher Kitchen. An 
alumnus of Flatbush Yeshiva, he 
ignored his alma mater's endorsement 
and carne to Yale, believing that its 
Jewish life would provide greater 
fluidity than the Orthodox-dominated 
life at Princeton. Although that vision 
has held true, Fisher sees opportunity 
for a more vital Jewish community. 

While Friday night Shabbat dinners 
attract up to 100 people, many stu-
dents' sole reminder of their Jewish 
heritage con&ists of a monthly trek out 
to Crown Street for cream cheese and 
lox.
