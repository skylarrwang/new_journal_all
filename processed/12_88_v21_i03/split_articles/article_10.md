Yale's Keeper 
David Greenberg 
Few students know "just what the 
provost does. That ignorance belies the 
impact that this administrator, second 
only to Yale's president, has on student 
life. Despite the provost's importance, 
the job is nebulous. As the "chairman 
of the Budget Committee, responsible 
for the allocation of roughly a half-
billion dollars, the provost must be 
constantly frugal; as the chief academic 
officer of the University, the provost 
must simultaneously 
foster 
Yale's 
educational 
viSion. 
This curious 
mixture of hard realities and lofty goals 
makes the post difficult to define. 

Frank Turner, however, professor of 
history and provost since last spring, 
has a clear conception of his role: It is 
not to struggle between two conflicting 
tasks, but to synthesize them. If 
Turner can show that the financial 
preoccupations of the job do not eclipse 
its educational side, 
the 
Yale 
community may begin to see the 
provost less as a budget-burdened 
administrator and more as a public 
spokesperson. 

Bill Brainard, 
professor of 
economics and provost from 1981 to 
1986, refers to the post as the "Keeper 
of the Common." "The provost looks 
out for the broad interests of the 
University. He's responsible for the 
whole, not the particular," he said. The 
provost's 
duties range from 
con-
sidering tenure appointments to 
implementing new academic programs 
to maintaining the University's 
physical resources. He oversees the 
deans of Yale's 
graduate and 
professional schools, as well as the 
dean of Yale College. In addition, he 
must take care of the odds and ends 
that no one else handles. "You have to 
define the provost's job negatively," 
said Georges May, Sterling professor 
of French and Brainard's predecessor. 
"Together, 
the provost and the 
president are responsible for the whole 
operation. The provost does whatever 
the president doesn't do." 

But in Â· certain situations the 

provost's role is unclear. For the 
professional schools, the provost acts as 
a "super-dean," as May put it. A 
professor in the Yale Medical School, 
for example, reports any problems to 
his own dean, consulting the provost 
only when necessary. A professor in 
the history department, however, 
could raise her concerns either to the 
dean of Yale College, the dean of the 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 
or to the provost. The situation is often 
confusing because all three figures 
fulfill the same function. William 
Nordhaus, professor of economics and 
provost from 1986 to 1988, thinks that 
Yale ought to have one dean for the 
faculty of arts and sciences, like many 
other universities. "The creation of the 
post would give greater coherence to 
everyone's job," Nordhaus said. 

The provost's most clearly defined 
task is 
overseeing the university 
budget. May says that in recent years 
the budget has become more difficult 
to control and consumes much of the 
provost's attention. He entered office 
after a period when the University was 
overspending. "When I was provost," 
he said, "my first task was to balance 
the budget. We were under orders 
from the Corporation. I spent a lot 
more time on it than perhaps I would 
have liked." The federal government 
now 
regulates the 
University's 
budgeting of such expenses as main-
tenance of the libraries, computer 
centers, 
and laboratories. 
Because 
these strictly regulated costs make up a 
large proportion of the overall budget, 
the provost must devote a lot of time 
trying to maneuver around them. 

Brainard and Nordhaus, the last two 
provosts, are both economics pro-
fessors. As Nordhaus pointed out, 
"There are advantages to the provost's 
being an economist. You're com-
fortable with budgets since you deal 
with them professionally. It's sort of a 
fringe benefit to the University." 

Brainard agreed that the provost ought 
to be "numerate." He explained, "Of 
course, he doesn't have to be an 
economist, but he can't be someone 
who's scared of numbers." 

Frank Turner, a professor of British 
intellectual history, seems like an 
atypical choice for provost. Spread 
sheets and investment portfolios are 
not his area of expertise. 
His 
enthusiasm for the humanities stems 
from a long involvement with liberal 
education. "I grew up in a small college 
town, my wife teaches at Connecticut 
College, and I attended William and 
Mary as an undergraduate," Turner 
said. He expects his students and 
colleagues to take their academics 
seriously. He has told students in one 
of his classes that they ought to laugh 
when reading Adam Smith's Wealth of 
Nations, weep over Edmund Gosse's 
Father and Son. 

Judy Federbush (SY '89), whose 
senior essay on Roman history in 19th-
century England was inspired by 
Turner's class, 
praised his com-
mitment to the study of ideas. "I think 
he mourned the demise of a kind of 
broad and comprehensive humanistic 
education, of learning for learning's 
sake," she said. Turner believes that 
when students take a real interest in 
their studies, they learn through their 
emotional responses. "Students should 
be really engaged in the material. We 
don't just teach subjects, we teach 
students," he explained. "You react. 
Then you think about the reaction. 
Why does it anger you, thrill you, 
sadden you? Why do others feel that 
way?" Turner believes that one should 
read Adam Smith not only for the 
historical significance, but also because 
"he's worth reading." 

Turner's passion for learning 
translates into rigid academic expec-
tations. 
Some students have had 
trouble living up to his standards. 
Aaron Levin OE '89), who took British 
intellectual history last fall, said, "' 
definitely didn't laugh when I read 
Adam Smith. I sort of snored." Some 
undergraduates find Turner's attitude
