A gargantuan stuffed blue sailfish 
hovers high above Tom Migdalski, 
Yale's assistant athletic director for 
club sports. On a wooden bookcase 
below the fish rest a badly chipped polo 
mallet, three riflery trophies, a well-
worn copy of The Moose Boolc, and a 
tarnished silver bowl from an ancient 
skiing victory. In the 40 years since the 
club sport system was founded by 
Migdalski's father, the program has 
grown from one club, the fishing team, 
to the current 25. 


Today's club sports range from team 
handball and TaeKwonDo to croquet 
and triathlon. They attract a large and 
diverse 
group of students, 
but 
University support Jags far behind
