old-fashioned, 
idealistic, 
or even 
pompous. Levin recalls that Turner 
would joke about reading obscure 
British thinkers in order to discuss 
them at cocktail parties. "The thing is 
that was almost too true to be laughed 
at," Levin said. Turner's old-world 
view of education affected his grading 
policy as well. "He was not very lenient 
with papers. If he keeps his deadlines 
the way he enforces them, he'll be a 
very good bureaucrat," he said. 


May believes that although Turner 
is an historian 
rather 
than an 
economist, he shares many qualities 
with previous provosts. "Brainard, 
Nordhaus, and Turner are all of the 
same mold," May said. "They all 
worked their way up at Yale from 
graduate students to full professors. 
They're all Yale men. The similarities 
are more important than the dif-
ferences." According to Gaddis Smith, 
Larned 
professor of history, 
the 
University ·chose Turner as provost 
partly because of his administrative 
experience. In 1983 and 1984, Turner 
served as chairman of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the Yale College 
Executive Committee, and revamped 
the procedures of that disciplinary 
body. Donald Kagan, professor of 
history, also praised Turner for his 
work in positions of academic 
leadership. "He was a great Director of 
Undergraduate Studies in the history 
department," said Kagan. Turner ran 
both the history junior seminar and the 
senior essay programs from 1975 to 
1978. Turner proved "a hell of a good 
administrator," according to Kagan, 
and the University felt that Turner's 
decisions had shown balance and 
judgment. 


A recent policy issued from the 
provost's office showed Turner's ability 
to bring his 
administrative skills 
together with his educational goals. As 
of this fall, faculty can eat lunch in the 
dining halls during the week for free. 
"There are certain things which cost 
some money which should be done," 
Turner said. "One thing that makes 
Yale unique is its amazingly free 
interaction between 
faculty 
and 
students, freer than at many small 
liberal arts schools. This decision is 
very much in line 
with 
Yale's 
tradition." 


This new program may indicate the 
direction Turner will take the office of 
provost. "It's important for me to 
remember what the larger effort is all 
about and to try to convey that to other 
people. I don't see myself as simply a 
functionary," he said. Gaddis Smith 
feels that Turner's historical 
training may help him integrate the 
various duties of the provost. "History 
is suited to teach the connectedness of 
alJ things. The historian cannot have 
tunnel-vision." To maintain a broad 
vision amid the mundane tasks of his 
bureaucratic job may 
require 
of 
Turner the same quality that allows 
him to find humor when reading 
Adam Smith.
