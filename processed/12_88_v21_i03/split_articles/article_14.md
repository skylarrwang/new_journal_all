numbers vary, 
most 
clubs 
have 
between ten and fifteen participants. 

Lastly, the athletic department gives 
preference to older clubs when 
distributing funds. During a club's first 
year , Migdalski provides facilities but 
will not give any money. As a club 
becomes older and better-established, the 
University expands its commitment. 
This emphasis on club age and size 
angers some team members, especially 
those from new, ambitious clubs. 
Because the cycling team is relatively 
new and 
low 
in 
numbers, 
the 
U niversity gives the club only $200. 
K en Obel (ES '91), team treasurer, 
complains that this policy puts the team 
in a Catch-22. To get more money, the 
club must prove that it can support a 
larger team. successfully, but to support 
a larger team it needs more money.

Lacking sufficient university 
support, clubs must be resourceful in 
financing their activities. To begin 
with, 
nearly every club collects 
membership fees, and most require 
participants to buy their own 
uniforms. In order to alleviate the 
remaining financial burden, many 
clubs run fundraisers or engage in 
part-time work related to their sports. 
Sailing club members give lessons to 
novice sailors and act as counselors in 
Yale's summer sailing academy. The 
men's volleyball team parks cars at 
home football games. Last winter the 
rugby team co-sponsored a Feb Club 
party at The Octagon, a New York 
City discotheque. 

Some fundraising efforts clashed with 
the University's bureaucracy. Last 
year, when the ultimate Frisbee club 
wanted to sell Frisbees, the University 
told the club it would have to conduct 
all sales through the Yale Student 
Agencies. After team captain Philip 
Weiss (SM '89) learned that these 
agencies would automatically take a

~ Weiss said. 

Larry Matthews, sounding like a 
ยฃ coach psyching up his team, stressed

Mike Walsh, however, regrets the 
sacrifices his club must make. "For the 
volleyball team to stay abreast of the 
competition, we've got to cut corners," 
he said. But regardless of their con-
flicting viewpoints, administrators and 
members of athletic clubs agree on the
