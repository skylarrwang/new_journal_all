Riling a Need 
Escalating rents, fierce competitiOn, 
and deteriorating neighborhoods all 
make housing a consuming worry for 
many New Haven families. Seventy-
eight percent of all families in the city 
fall into the moderate-to-low income 
category, and most of these families 
are paying more rent than they can 
afford. By federal standards a family 
should not pay more than 30 percent of 
its income in rent. But for many New 
Haven families, 50 to 70 percent of 
their 
income goes for 
that very 
purpose. And families find their rents 
skyrocketing. "You never know when 
your rent's going to go up," said Glenn 
Ellis, a resident of New Haven's 
Newhallville neighborhood. 

W ithin 
two years Ellis' rent rose $200. High 
rents make it difficult for families to 
save the several 
thousand dollars 
needed for a down payment on a 
house. Even if they could make such a 
payment, houses are scarce on the 
New H aven market. 

The city has been trying to combat 
high rents and the housing shortage 
with the innovative Intil Housing 
program. As part of the city's lnfil 
program, non-profit developers build 
duplex houses on vacant lots in some of 
New Haven's ~ ost run-down neigh-
?orhoods. The city then offers low-
Interest loans to help moderate-income 
families finance the houses. These 
families must agree 
to certain 
conditions before they can take part in 
the Inftl program. They must rent the 
~pstai rs unit of the duplex to a low-
Income family, and they must live in 
the ~ouse for at least 15 years. By 
~reatmg these rules, the city hopes to 
mcr~~se low-income housing and bring 
stabhty to the neighborhoods it has 
targeted: Newhallville, D ixwell, and 
the H ill. 

.Home ownership, the city believes, 
Will stabilize these neighborhoods that 
have deteriorated partly from the 
inattention of absentee landlords. 
They let their buildings fall apart 
because they regard their property 
only as a means to make a profit, said 
Leo Quigley, the acting director of 
Research and Planning of the city's 
Office of Housing and Neighborhood 
Development. 

"Home owners, how-
ever, take greater pride in maintaining 
their property and are more likely to be 
active and concerned 
for their 
neighborhood ," he said . H e hopes that 
this concern will translate into a safer, 
more attractive environment. 

It will take a long time to create this 
environment at the present rate of 
construction . In the three years since 
the program began , the city has 
completed only 25 Infil houses and is 
in the process of constructing 100 
more. It had originally hoped to build 
271 homes. But difficulty acquiring 
vacant lots has delayed construction. 
W hen the program Â·started, there were 
a number of property owners who 
owed back taxes on their vacant lots. 
When the back taxeS exceed the value 
of the property, the city can foreclose 
on the lots and use them for its own 
purposes. As word of the city's plans to 
revitalize 
the 
neighborhoods got 
around, property values went up, and 
property owners began to pay ofT their 
back taxes to keep the city from taking 
their lots. 

Quigley is frustrated with these 
property owners because he thinks 
they are ignoring the community's 
housing needs. Many of the owners let 
their lots go unused so they can sell 
them for a profit after property values 
rise, he said. Despite a setback, the city 
is still trying to build the original 
number of houses by using more 
drastic methods. This year it has had 
to purchase lots in order to continue 
building. 

A few lucky families have already 
moved into their new homes. Glenn 
Ellis and his family settled in last 
month. Ellis pays nearly the same 
amount in mortgage payments as he 
used to pay in rent, but now he has his 
own backyard, more living space, and 
no more 
worries about escalating 
rents. Ellis' 
housing problems are 
over, and if the city can rework its Infil 
program, other families can soon move 
in .
