student enthusiasm. Since Yale fully 
funds 35 varsity teams as well as a 
33-sport 
intramural 
program, 
the 
athletic department can offer only 
scant financial assistance to the clubs. 
"In terms of facilities and funding, club 
sports are third on the administration's 
list, behind varsity and intramurals," 
Migdalski said. "The budget for club 
sports at Yale is $12,800 a year. 
There's only so much we can do with 
that money." Most teams get between 
$250 and $500 annually. Some of the 
larger clubs, like rugby and men's 
volleyball, get closer to $1 , 000. 

Club sports also tend to lose out 
whenever conflicts arise over facilities. 
The badminton team complains that 
its traditional Sunday time slot has 
been usurped by an aerobics class. The 
kayaking team needs a place in Payne 
Whitney Gymnasium to practice 
eskimo rolls. The ultimate Frisbee club 
fumes over tailgaters who leave broken 
glass and bits of aluminum strewn 
around the parking fields where the 
club holds its games. 

In spite of economic problems and 
bureaucratic hassles, club sports thrive 
at Yale, allowing students to pursue a 
variety of esoteric athletic interests. 
"Club sports offer a whole range of 
opportunities not given by varsity. 
They widen the scope of athletics at 
Yale 
wonderfully," said Larry 
Matthews, associate athletic director 
for non-varsity sports. 

Some teams consider club-sport 
status an ideal arrangement while 
others resent the University's refusal to 
award them higher standing. Men's 
rugby, Yale's largest non-varsity team, 
functions smoothly as a club sport. 
The organization boasts 50 players, 
membership in 
a 
regional 
rugby 
union, 
and an 
alumni 
association. 
The men's 
volleyball 
team, 
however, 
feels 
trapped- by 
club 
ranking. The team's athletic status 
severely restricts ability to compete 
with varsity programs at other schools. 

In 1978, men's volleyball was a 
varsity sport. One year later, the 
athletic department dropped the team 
from varsity to club. The team tried 
for eight years to regain its varsity 
status, but acting Athletic Director 
Donald Kagan disappointed the club 
last year by deciding that an additional 
varsity team 
would be fiscally 
impossible. "That pretty much left us 
in the dust," lamented Mike Walsh 
(SY '89). Trained only by a volunteer 
coach, the club works hard to match 
the caliber of its varsity opponents, 
practicing two hours every day, five 
days a week, from October until April. 
"We 
have varsity 
intensity and 
ambition but only a club's budget and 
status," Walsh said. 

Especially frustrating to the 
volleyball players are National 
Collegiate Athletics Association 
(NCAA) regulations that bar club 
teams from 
competing in local 
invitational tournaments. "The 
invitations come," Walsh said, "but we 
have to turn them down because we

aren't varsity." The team is also 
ineligible for the NCAA champion-
ships held at the end of the season. 
Regardless of its success, the club must 
settle for participation in the Ivy 
tournament or the club championship 
tournament, in which it placed second 
in 1987 and fourth last year. 

Perhaps most discouraging to the 
team, the University has deferred 
reinstating the "club-varsity" athletic 
category, an intermediate classification 
that existed from 1984 to 1986. This 
special arrangement would make it 
possible for a club to participate in 
varsity events, hut would not require 
the University to make an additional 
financial commitment. Currently, the 
club-varsity option remains frozen, 
pending an examination 
by new 
Athletic Director Edward Woodsum 
(YC '53). "We've had three athletic 
directors in three years," explained 
Migdalski. "Mr. Woodsum wants to 
examine the option carefully before 
reinstating it." In the meantime, the 
volleyball team must wait. 

Although some teams want varsity 
standing, others feel that the club sport 
option best suits their needs. "I don't 
have any problem with our status," 
said George Marshman (SM '89), rugby 
team president. "There are things we 
want from the University that they won't 
give us, but this team couldn't function 
the way we want it to on the varsity 
level." Unlike varsity teams, athletic 
clubs have latitude to shape their own 
activities. If the rugby players-known 
widely for their high spirits- want to 
toast God, country, and Yale after 
every successful serum, no one at the 
club sport office will interfere.
