THE DAYTIME TRASH HEAP IS GAMSON'S GOLD MINE.

I Can't Stop Cheating! 
"Brandy has been a busy girl. She's a 
newlywed and she's already cheating on her 
husband, Bobby, with her co-worker, 
Celeste. Bobby gets the double-whammy 
when Brandy then introduces her other 
lover, Ariwna! Bobby demands a divorce 
while Celeste and Arizona argue over who 
gets Brandy." 
. 
So reads the official plug for the July 
28, 1998 ferry Springer Show-a twisted 
love square with Arizona, Bobby, Brandy 
and Celeste at the corners. Most of us 
would readily dismiss this program as 
another example of televised inanity. 
However, one Yale professor would happily 
glean some academic points on sex identiry 
from such a paragraph. 
Joshua Gamson, Yale sociologist, is the 
author of Freaks Talk Back, a book that 
explains public con ceptions of sexual 
identity and deviance by studying talk 
shows. 
Gamson, 
a 
self-described 
"scholarman and gayman," is interested in 
how perceptions of sexual outsiders are 
constructed in American public culture. He 
roots his book in the abundant and fertile 
dirt of talk shows. 
Freaks Talk Back presents a staggering 
amount of research. Gamson has read over 
160 talk show transcripts, interviewed 20 
talk show production staff members and 44 
guests, facilitated 13 focus group 
discussions with 75 regular talk show 
viewers and, most impressively, watched a 
mind-numbing 100 hours of taped shows. 
(He is also the proud owner of the 
infamous "Jerry Springer Too Hot for TV" 
video and is probably the only American 
able to deduct the cost of this gem from his 
taXes as a business expense). 

The result of this exhaustive research is 
a book that seems to cover every skirmish 
over sexual identiry ever fought on the talk 
show battlefield. Most fundamentally, 
Gamson challenges the immediate 
assumption that talk shows' freak-
treatment of gays and other sexual 
outsiders is necessarily bad. Instead he 
argues that these shows are significant 
components of public dialogue and deserve 
scholarly attention. Gamson points out 
that talk shows are one of the few public 
venues afforded to sexual ~onconformists, 
which he thinks makes them noteworthy 
and worth studying. 

Gamson starts with a brief history of 
talk shows, traci!lg their evolution from 
"the mother of all talk shows," Donahue, to 
the emotional Oprah Winfrey Show, to the 
now-familiar "trash" shows such as Ricki, 
SalLy fessy Raphael and ferry Springer. 
Interestingly, he reminds the reader that 
talk shows used to be everytfiing that sexual 
nonconformists could have hoped for. 
Donahue, 
for 
example, 
presented 
respectable, well-educated gays during a 
time when media appearances elsewhere 
were scarce. 

Continuing his historical look, Gamson 
then tackles the more difficult and recent 
talk shows, which focus on freakish guests 
who flash their sexual deviance. These 
shows feature the "deviants" we have all 
come to recognize: "lipstick lesbians," 
"cross-dressing hookers," "drag kings" and 
"transsexual call girls." Do the Freaks talk 
back? Responding thematically, he answers: 
sometimes yes, sometimes no. Gamson 
argues that talk shows improve the 
visibiliry of sexual nonconformists, but do 
so by exposing only their unattractive, less 
socially acceptable undersides. 

This kind of wishy-washy answer 
characterizes the next few chapters of the 
book. Employing an "on the one hand, on 
the other hand" approach makes the 
middle section of the book somewhat 
incoherent. The reader learns that talk 
shows are constructed on a foundation of 
lies, yet reveal bursts of truth about sex 
identiry that do not show up anywhere else 
in pop culture. We are told in one chapter 
that 
talk 
shows 
sometimes 
cast 
homophobes in a negativ~ light, but at 
other times justify anti-gay rhetoric. Next, 
Gamson posits that talk shows briefly 
challenge fixed sex identity norms, but 
then quickly reassure the television viewer 
that sex categories are still what they used 
to be. Although it is gratifying that these 
points are brought out in their full 
complexity, 
the book lacks clear 
organization and is more often incoherent 
than illuminating. 

This incoherence does not infringe on 
the book's entertainment value. As one of 
his themes, Gamson purports to explain 
how the institutional arrangements of talk Â· 
shows shape the dialogue that occurs on 
the set. When talking about the "booking" 
process and its effect on talk show 
dialogue, Gamson relates interviews with 
producers that reveal how sleazy they really 
are. He tells the story of Linda Phillips, the 
transsexual guest who arrived on the set 
only to find out that the other guests were 
weight lifrers and the world's tallest man. 
When she refused to go on this "freak 
show," producers withheld her plane ticket 
home. 

Another producer tried to book a 
woman whose five-year-old daughter had 
allegedly been raped by her HN-positive 
husband during their wedding reception. 
The producer recounts, "I remember being 
on the phone with the mother, saying, you 
know, 'The best thing for you to do is 
come on this show and cell your story,' that 
whole bullshir. You know, let me exploit 
you even more. You'v~ been through hell, 
come on TV and talk about it." 

Unfortunately, Gamson does not always 
do an effective job at showing how these 
horrific (and secretly titillating) production 
arrangements structure the dialogue on the 
set of talk shows. As the book progresses, 
this theme is more often presented almost 
as an afterthought-instead of taking a 
central role in the book, the talk show 
institution 
and 
its 
production 
arrangements seem secondary to portraying 
what actually occurs on the set. One wishes 
he had established a clear tie between the 
shenanigans that occur in front of and 
behind the curtains. 

The book's redeeming moment arrives 
in chapter six, entitled "Flaunting It." It 
begins with one of the book's best devices: 
Gamson's personal anecdotes, which at 
rimes transform the book into a calk show 
about its author. 
Gamson 
relates his coming-out 
experiences in the Yale; classroom. "Taking a 
deep breath, I would walk in, strip off my 
sweater, and reveal a T-shirt: pink triangle, 
'Silence = Death,' black background. 'What 
does the T-shirt mean?' I would ask. 'Why 
would I want to wear it here? Isn't my 
sexuality none of your business?' Many 
nodded, but the elementary lesson got 
through: sexual identity, like it or not, is all 
about power; although to me my gay self is 
increasingly boring, it has become 
increasingly political; this moment, me 
standing before you in a T-shur, is politics." 

This chapter is all about politics. 
Gamson argues that talk shows "put a face" 
on homosexuality, revealing the real people 
who are victims of bigotry. "Talk show 
visibility, when it is seen as an important 
cultural wing of a political project, sets in 
motion its own localized politics." Starring 
with chis late chapter, Gamson turns his 
research into an effective study on talk 
show-shaped sex identity that relates to 
visibility in pop culture and politics. 

As expected, the. ''on the one hand, on 
the other hand" treatment re-emerges, but 
it is more relevant and dearly-written this 
time around. He examines how talk shows 
reflect and exacerbate divisions between 
upper-class and lower-class gays. Also, he 
constructs an interesting argument 
suggesting that the wedding of "personal 
and political" on talk shows is perhaps 
detrimental to the protection of the privacy 
of gays and sexual outsiders. These are all 
themes that have larger currency among 
academics and activists-people who are 
not merely interested in a book about 
trashy television. 

This chapter, like the rest of the book, 
has no clear answer as to whether or nor 
talk shows are good or bad for public 
media perceptions; but upon reflection, 
maybe this is a feat in and of itself. 
Gamson has started with the traditional 
assumption chat talk shows freakify sexual 
outsiders, and fought to the middle ground 
where that point is not so clear after all. If 
you've ever watched talk shows, which 
seem to gather a bunch of ignorant people 
together so they can take vicious verbal 
blows at each other, the argument is all the 
more impressive. 

Gamson points out that the talk shows' 
complete lack of a message may lead to an 
increase in tolerance. "Over rime, the talk 
shows have managed to do for their 
audiences what no one else has: to make 
homosexuality, and even transsexualism 
and bisexuality, basically dull." He quotes a 
guest on Ricki, who says, "These shows, 
however vacuous, may be eroding 
homophobia by their sheer lack of 
commitment to any point of view." 

Though talk shows lack any discernible 
viewpoint, they make sexual "deviance" 
seem commonplace and even boring. 
Freaks Talk Back can be credited with an 
impressively thorough investigation of a 
surprising topic. As Gamson points out, talk 
shows are one of the most accessible media 
outlets for gays and other sexual outsiders, 
and are certainly worth academic attention. 
Although the complex themes that Gamson 
charts out sometimes lose coherence in the 
telling, with their development the book 
becomes more relevant to areas of public life 
beyond talk shows. And hey-with section 
titles like "Defecating in public" and 
"Donna wears a jockstrap! Donna wears a 
jockstrap!" the book is not nearly as dry as 
one might expect.
