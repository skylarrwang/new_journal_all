Project X 
As Old Blue collides with the 21st centu-
ry, its technological capability will be put to 
the rest. The next millenium may bring upon 
us such calamities as disappearance of grades, 
the obliteration of library records, and the 
sealing of encryways, all because Yale's leg-
endary endowment may vanish into digitized 
ether. 

Aie we destined to self-destruct? In our 
self-satisfied complacency, have we entered at 
lightning speed a narrow tunnel whose only 
egress is our own annihilation? What son of 
wizardry will allow us to avert the oncoming 
disaster? Which brave souls will spare us from 
this terrifying fate? None other than the tech-
nological scions ofYale's Project X. 

As the class of.l999 prepares to graduate, 
the university grapples with the preparations 
it must make to accommodate the needs of 
future classes. Like many other institutions, 
Yale needs to upgrade its administrative sys-
terns co make them Year 2000 (or Y2K, as 
your friendly CA. would put it) compliant. 
Current administrative programs are quire 
complex, time-consuming, and costly, and 
frequently fail ro provide adequate informa-
tion. Furthermore, Yale's systems lack proper 
tools to formulate straregies and effectively 
manage the university. 

The brains of Project X are working 
coward a viable solution for the current prob-
lems in Yale's administrative systems. In lieu 
of simply "patching up" or upgrading current 
software, the Project X dynamos have decided 
ro replace rhe entire kit and caboodle with 
newly developed software. This will aUow 
Yale not only to solve the Year 2000 bug, but 
will also enhance Yale's management of finan-
cial and human resources. 

The Project X team has enlisted rhe 
expertise of Oracle Corporation to modernize 
Yale's administrative systems in four ways. 
First, the new systems wiU allow improved 
management and planning capacity at aU lev-
els through accurate and timely information, 
user-friendly 
analysis, 
and lightning-fast 
reporting tools. A new data warehouse and 
faster running, easy-ro-use software applica-
tions will make this possible. Second, Project 
X will provide better administrative services to 
faculty, srudents, staff, alumni and donors 
through simpler communication services. 

Third, Oracle's new systems wiJJ slash admin-
istrative costs by minimizing data entered and 
reducing error correction. Finally, they wiJI 
reduce rhe risk of data loss and financial mis-
calculation through sophisticated backup sys-
tems and tighter control over expenditures 
and revenues. 

The pursuit of these new administrative 
systems commenced in the summer of 1996. 
Provost Alison Richard and Joseph Mullinix, 
Vice President for Finance and Administra-
tion, ignited a Steering Committee for the 
project and coordinated the efforts of four 
other teams to mobilize Project X. More than 
60 staff members from the central administra-
tion and different departments within Yale 
have worked together to develop an overall 
strategy and understand the costs and benefits 
of such an undertaking. 

By signing with the Oracle Corporation, 
Yale has the potencial to benefit from partner-
ships with other universities already commit-
ted to rhe Oracle software. The University of 
Pennsylvania, which currently utilizes an Ora-
cle financial system, has proven helpful in 
sharing its experiences and insights on the sys-
tem. Stanford and Harvard, both planning to 
launch Oracle-based projects, have shown 
interest not only in sharing informacion but 
also in coordinating training with Yale. 

Project X, slated for completion by Janu-
ary 1, 1999, will be carried our in two phases. 
Phase I, already complete, provides the Uni-
versity with a novel set of financial analysis 
tools. These tools give Yale easy on-line access 
to financial data. Phase I also included instal-
lation of a new time and attendance system, a 
novel travel and entertainment expense reim-
bursement procedure, and recenr techniques 
for job postings and applicant processing. 

Phase II will continue improvements by mod-
ernizing accounts management processes such 
as payroll, benefits, and claims procedures. 
The Project X team expects that ongoing 
developments will continue beyond the grad-
uarion of the class of 1999, as the university 
begins to exploit the fearures of these new sys-
tems. 

By equipping Old Blue with Oracle's new 
systems, the Project X task force will assure 
that Yale's Generation Y will be armed for 
Y2K and beyond.
