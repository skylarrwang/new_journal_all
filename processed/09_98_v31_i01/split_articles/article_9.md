Â· From his office, Jim Garman (ES '98) can see the San Francisco 
skyline-"if you stand in the right spot and twist your body the right 
way," he says. "We're thinking of painting footprints so people know 
where to stand." Garman, however, is not one to stand where he's told. 
As a senior at Yale, he saw his peers take graduate exams, fill out appli-
cations, and send out resumes, taking their places on the footprints oth-
ers had already painted. But Garman found none of those fit him, so he 
set off to paint his own. 

Garman and fellow Yale alum Antony Brydon (TD '95) are the 
founders, directors, and entire staff of the Habitat Bike and Build, 
which they hope will become a multi-million dollar fundraiser for 
Habitat for Humanity. Their office suite is simple: two desks, maps on 
the walls, empty space. It differs greatly from what 26-year-old Brydon 
became f.uniliar with in three years of strategy consulting with R. B. 
Webber and Company. But the Bike and Build is the realization of a 
vision Brydon had more than five years ago. 

In September of 1992, Brydon embarked upon a journey that has 
yet to end. Returning to Yale for his junior year, Brydon found school 
uninspiring. "I did the first ten days at Yale thing," Brydon says, 
"where you shop all the classes you're imerested in. Couldn't find any." 
So Brydon sought help from the dean of T lDlothy Dwight, John 
Loge. Hurricane Andrew had recently swept through southern Flori-
da, and Brydon told Dean Loge of his interest in helping to rebuild 
Miami. "He recognized that I was a lot more passionate about that 
than I would be about my classes." So, at the encouragement of his 
dean, Brydon-an avid cyclist-lefr New Haven on bicycle. More 
than three weeks later, he arrived in Atlanta. It was there that he called 
Habitat for Humanity and told them he was on his way to Miami. 

Habitat told him that they didn't have a spot for him in Miami; howev-
er, Americus, Georgia, did have some openings in construction~ "I rode 
down from Atlanta, showed up on my bike, and ended up working in 
construction there for three and a half months." Brydon's stipend was 
only 40 dollars a week, plus an extra 25 each month for emertainment. 
But he did gain experience working with other Habitat volunteers 
whose sole focus was building houses. 

Before arriving in Americus, Brydon's Habitat experience consisted 
of a few volunteer stints at home. "I think it can be described as 
luck. .. or divine intervention that it ended up being a program with . 
which I found so much in common." In Americus, Habitat is not just 
another non-profit organization. Americus is the headquarters of Habi-
tat for Humanity International (HFHI), which oversees the 1500 affili-
ates worldwide. For a semester, Brydon toured on his bicycle in the 
morning and worked on a site in the afternoon. The connection 
between Habitat and cycling had begun. But it was not until the fall of 
1993, when Brydon returned to Yale, that he figured out how to use 
that connection. 

Brydon and a core group of students found it hard to become 
involved with Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven. The chap-
ter was building only one house, and they had more volunteers than 
they were able to use. "If we were going to build a house," Brydon 
remembers, "we were going to need to fund it ourselves." That was 
when Brydon discovered the potential of the Habitat-cycling connec-
tion and conceived of the cross-country ride . 

"We were going to raise half a million dollars," says Brydon. His 
postering and word-of-mouth campaign drew 90 interested Yalies and 
40 applications at the first meeting. Unfortunately, limited sponsorship 
meant limited participation. By selecting the applicants most devoted
