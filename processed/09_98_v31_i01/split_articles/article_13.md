Properties, and they aren't talking beyond 
what's already known. ~ 
There has only been one moment in the 
Broadway real estate fiasco when the universi-
ty did seem to know its students and their 
alliances well, and that occurred in the timing 
of the eviction of the Daily. Started by a Yale 
graduate in 1989, it is not 
surprising that current Yalies 
still appreciate the "great cof-
fees, fine pastries, and decent 
people" at the Daily. By serv-
ing the eviction papers just as 
students returned to campus 
and before classes had begun, 
Yale attempted to get the 
Daily out quietly. The chaos 
of Camp Yale and the excite-
ment of seeing friends after a 
summer apart are probably 
enough to mask the activity 
on the corner of Park and 
Elm, where Daily patrons 
have been thronging since 
they heard the news. 

I called people at 
University Properties 
and said, "Look, I 
can guarantee your 
rent, I've been here 
eleven years. I have 
Predictably, Yale is salivat-
ing at the thought of buying 
the FDIC properties, which 
occupy most of the block on 
Chapel between College and 
High Streets. They've been 
negotiating the deal with the 
FDIC for over a year. Baker 
knew this, and she appealed 
to Yale as the building's future 
owner. "I called the people at 
University 
Properties 
and 
said, 'Look, I can guarantee 
your rent, I've been here 11 years, I have an 
established business, people love it, and now 
I'm getting thrown out on the street--can't 
you intervene?'" says Baker. She was greeted 
with empathy but not action. She's resigned 
herself to vacate her store by the end of Sep-
tember. 

"You have to understand-I'm sympa-
thetic to Frances Baker, but Joel Schiavone 
didn't do anything wrong." says Fahey of the 
Sugar Magnolia situation. "If an owner 
doesn't like a tenant and their lease is up, they 
can tell a tenant to leave." Fahey's words are 
caltn and rational, employing exactly the same 
logic used to remove the Daily from Broad-
way. The difference is that now we're talking 
about Chapel Sueet, which has a tiny corpo-
rate presence and is dominated by small busi-
nesses. One would think that a small success-
ful store like Sugar Magnolia would be 
encouraged to stay. 

Fahey's reaction to Baker's predicament is 
disturbing if one considers that in several 
months Yale will be the owner on Chap~t 
Street with the right to turn tenants out. n 
only people Yale has turned out of late are d 
small businesses on Broadway, which m~ 
provide a glimpse of the future for Chap( 
Fahey is quick to discourage this thought, sa: 
ing, "It's already the kind of district that Ya 
would like to have. The university's interest 
to maintain the district as is-to keep the fe 
of the district and improve the base building 
Tenants will leave and tenants will come, bt 
the goal is to keep that feel of the district." 

Perhaps the university's public intentio1 
are good, but Yale's track record for maintain-
ing the "feel" of a district is not impressive. u 
the "feel" of Broadway is supposed to be sn 
dent-oriented, Yale has adopted the reducti' 
view that corporate equals collegiate. Not a 
Yalies want designer coffee and clothes, an 
many of them would rather give their mom 
to smaller businesses that contribute- to d 
atmosphere of a college town. 

This is not to say that Chapel Street ca 
see its future on Broadway. However, rumo 
are already flying among the Chapel Stre. 
store owners that Yale has well-established 
intentions that may not include them. It is 
unlikely that Yale would want to inundate 
Chapel with cookie-cutter corporate stores 
that have the plastic atmosphere of a mall. But 
with the Gap and Ann Taylor considered to 
be some of the "nicest" stores on Chapel, and 
Yale's intentions to make the downtown dis-
trict a place attractive to business people as 
well as parents of Yale students, the Chapel 
merchants should t~ note. The university is 
often off the mark when attempting to cater 
to its clientde. 

Shapiro was hoping that his evtctton 
would serve as a rallying point for students to 
protest Yale's restructuring of Broadway. "I 
wanted to let students protest and force Yale 
to stop hiding behind corporate bureaucra-
cy-the nameless and faceless people," he 
says. "I was hoping Yale would see that they're 
pissing off their own students with their deci-
sions." Unfortunately, one day's notice on a 
weekend eviction doesn't provide much time 
to get the word out, let alone allow under-
graduates to contact Yale officials. Shapiro 
knows this and credits the university with 
strategic timing. 

"Man, they can't close this place down," a 
local man interrupts. "It's practically a New 
Haven landmark. How can they do this to 
you?" Shapiro grimaces and says, "The short 
answer is money. They're forcing me out." His 
young daughter tentatively approaches and 
sits next to him while his wife looks on. "''m 
out of an income--1 don't have a job any-
more," Shapiro says between the goodbyes of 
friends and customers. The scene is pathetic. 
The contents of the store rolling by us seem to 
be the death-knell of the family-run business. 
"Yale killed the little guy again," mumbles an 
employee. 

In anticipation of school starting, Shapiro 
repainted the Daily three days ago. "I wanted 
the place to feel fresh and new and welcom-
ing," he says. And indeed, he did attract stu-
dents who were enticed by the brighter interi-
or. "This morning a freshman came in with 
her mother," says Shapiro. "They were look-
ing around and I could see that they liked the 
place. She came up to me and said, 'You have 
my business for the next four years."' Shapiro's 
expression contoru and he sighs. "I didn't 
have the heart to tell her that I won't be here 
come tomorrow morning."
