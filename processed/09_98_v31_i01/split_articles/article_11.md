EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The phone rang on the third floor of Kline Biology Tower 
(KBT) and a post-doctoral researcher picked up. "Tama Has-
son?" a mysterious voice said. "We've done a positional done 
on the deafness gene-and it's a gene for myosin." 
Myosin was the protein Hasson had been studying for years. It 
turned out that mutations in the genetic code for the protein caused a 
major human disorder, a form of deafness. In an instant, Hasson was 
transformed from another underpaid biology Ph.D-a post-doc-to a 
scientific superstar. 

Such phone calls are the stuff of post-doc dreams. Scientists like 
Hasson take on an assortment of names: post-doctoral fellows, associate 
research faculty. What matters is that they have the Ph.Ds that make 
them bonafide scientists, and that they're not professors. 

Post-docs endure 60-hour work weeks, publish only a few times 
during their career, and make less money than most librarians. In their 
early twenties, up to their elbows in graduate school, they sleep on sofas 
in laboratory lounges. ln their late twenties, they tend to marry each 
other. They refer to themselves as "non-entities" and "indentured ser-
vants." Working in the lab of a university professor, they live off grants 
that usually pay less than $30,000 per year. Until they prove themselves 
in the labs, they hover in academic limbo, shunning higher-paying jobs 
in industry and a host of other options for a chance at a professorship. 

Hasson's big moment reveals the tension between science for the 
sake of individual discovery and science for the sake of winning the aca-
demic game. We were taught in our grade-school textbooks that science 
is the enterprise of discovery, of asking why. Bur in contemporary acad-
emia, a permanent "position" is the prize at hand. Professors, unlike 
those beneath them on the ladder, enjoy virtually unfettered scientific 
freedom. As principle investigator, the professor acts as coach, top 
strategist, publicity manager, and boss for a large team of graduate stu-
dents, technicians, and post-docs. Before post-docs earn their own lab, 
they must work for someone else's agenda. 

Driven to attain a better position ensuring greater academic free-
dom, post-docs are more than curious people. They are public explorers, 
driven by a will to rise to the top of their fields, gaining the respect of 
both their peers and the pundits who keep score in the scientific world. 

Trying to escape this academic limbo can be a frustrating strug-
gle. William Leiserson, a 40-year-old post-doc, is a researcher in 
genetics, a field in which papers are especially difficult to pub-
lish; a future position in academics will be difficult to attain. "Forty is 
old enough to have a real job," he says. "Personally, I'm slower than 
many others. That's the way I work." Add a wife and two kids, and the 
pressure to perform only intensifies. Between supporting a family and 
trying to publish-the only means of improving a salary designed for a 
26-year-old workaholic-he's got less time to work than his competi-
tors. 

It's an uphill battle, but one that Leiserson takes on willingly. Post-
docs may get frustrated, but they know that they could leave academia 
at any time and find decently paying jobs waiting for them in industry. 
There is no comparable outlet for Ph.Ds in non-technical fields. The 
only reason to remain in a low-paying post-doc position is the chance 
to rise through the academic ranks. 

Lisa Evans, in the second year of her post-doctoral appointment in 
Mark Mooseker's lab at Yale, followed the same path for a long time. "I 
always thought that I wanted to be, essentially, Mark someday," says 
Evans. But looking a few years into her thirties, she's finding that there 
may not be room in her life for her career, personal satisfaction, and a 
third factor-<>ne that scientists often leave out of their professional 
equations-a family. Recently engaged to a policeman in the New 
Haven area, she knows _she'll have little geographic Aexibiliry in the next 
few years, making a job search that much more difficult. And as 
opposed to industrial jobs which often offer child-care programs and 
materniry leave, academic positions make it difficult for women to 
begin families. 

Evans now questions the commitment that is necessary to climb the 
ladder. Like many post-docs, she's considering the alternatives to a uni-
versiry job. The expanding pharmaceutical industry and its biotech off-
shoots are desperate for outstanding researchers and offer high paying 
salaries to compensate them. Commercial laboratories boast jobs less 
time-intensive than academic posts, with salaries nearly tripling Evans's 
relatively small grants. 

Looking beyond universiry research has drawn Evans to Connecti-
cut's small liberal-arts colleges. By working in a school dedicated to 
undergraduate teaching, she feels she could raise a family. Granted, 
teaching four days a week and running a lab at a small school won't 
land Evans on the cover of Cell, but for her the priorities have changed. 

Her boss thinks she could compete for some of the top research 
spots in the country. An appointment in Mooseker's lab is already an 
accolade; of the 20 Ph.Ds who have worked in his lab, all but one have 
gone on to careers in academia. "If she wanted to," Professor Mooseker 
says with assurance, "Lisa could go all the way." 

Academic science didn't always require prolonged post-doctoral 
positions. "~en to 15 years ago, post-doctoral appointments 
were one or two years," says Larry Holmes, professor of History 
of Science at Yale. These days, universities have a glut of tenured scien-
tists, with at least 20 years left before retirement. 

One look at the back pages of Science or Nature reveals the realities 
that await postdocs. Behind the articles that bring fame and funding are 
pages of advenised post-doc and biotech openings-and a handful of 
staff positions in academia. 

A marked deanh of basic research positions in the "hard" sciences 
means most Ph.Ds in physics and math go into industry. "Of people in 
physics taking a post-doctoral appointment, one in 20 stay in acade-
mia," says Ken Swartz, a post-doc at Yale. "You see a lot of physics peo-
ple turn to computer science, nuclear medicine." Swartz will try for an 
academic position, but he's content to begin a career outside the acade-
my. He estimates in industry he'll make about $80,000 to start. 

"Sometimes you think, 'As long as I'd be a professor that would be 
everything,"' he says, "but you realize that's not the case." 

For scientists like Hasson, however, there's nothing else. Even 
before 1995, 12-hour days in the lab were normal. But that fate-
ful afternoon changed the face of the game. "That call changed 
my life," Hasson remembers. From there, her 70-hour weeks in lab 
meant even more. She was winning the game. A year later, a second 
phone call announced that another of her myosin varieties had been 
implicated in deafness. This time she flew down to Maryland, and 
worked for three days straight to prepare a paper for Nature Genetics. 
Thanks to her research's applicability for deafness, more money and 
collaborations came in, and paper upon paper went out. Subsequently, 
she worked 10 to 12-hour days seven days a week. The time commit-
ment has paid off. This year, she landed an assistant professor posicion 
at Universiry of California at San Diego. 

To rise in the system, soon-to-be-Professor Hasson has learned, one 
needs luck as well as perseverance. Even with powerful scientific knowl-
edge and a relentless work ethic, it's unclear whether she'd have made it 
without those fateful phone calls from distant geneticists. Now she's set 
to start her own lab in at one of the world's biology meccas. 

More than a dozen papers, prestige, and expen status testifY to her 
position. But does she ever escape the struggle? Can a scientist learn for 
the sake of learning, and discover for the joy of discovery alone-with 
no regard to the ramifications, professional or otherwise? 

As Hasson describes the genes that have kept her on the trail for so 
long, a glimmer of fascination appears in her eyes behind her glasses. 
There is a perceptible rise in her voice as she explains answers that have 
taken five years of her life to discover. But it's ten o'clock on a Wednes-
day night, and she hasn't seen her husband in three days. In her labora-
tory, thousands of multicolored test-tubes and bottles watch us from 
the shelves. KBT is still. A machine in the corner emits a low whir. "It's 
quiet here at night," she says wistfully. "It's amazing how much you can 
accomplish."
