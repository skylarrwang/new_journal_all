EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
chemotherapeutic agent that destroys the 
rapidly dividing cells df the early embryo-
have been frequent topics in the science media 
for some time. "One of our biggest priorities 
right now is in non-surgical options ... that 
make abortion a more private, less invasive 
matter, something that a woman can do at 
home," Yolen of Planned Parenthood said. 

Investigations of the long-term effects of 
methotrexate, as well as efforts to reduce the 
duration of RU-486 treatment and the heavy 
bleeding it causes, "ace areas for active 
research," Dr. Merrick said, "but it's not dis-
cussed. I've never heard it discussed. And I'm 
not sure how much it really needs to be dis-
cussed. D&C [dilation and curatage, the stan-
dard surgical procedure for first-trimester 
abortions] is hundreds of years old. It's safe, 
effective, and has been proven over time." Dr. 
Bennett offers another rationale: "There ace 
just more pressing issues out there. If you had 
me choose between research funds for abor-
tion or AIDS, I'd choose AIDS." 

That word "choose," so long the buzz-
word of the abortion rights movement, seems 
equally important to these abortion providers 
as to the advocates of the women they treat. 
They choose their words and actions accord-
ing to sometimes confl.icting concerns about 
their livelihood, reputation, academic inter-
ests, and humanitarian impulses. Dr. Mer-
rick's and Dr. Bennett's comments may smack 
of complacency or rationalization, but these 
doctors tread on treacherous ground. And 
they take their work home with them. ''I'm 
adopted, so it's a little weird for me," Dr. Ben-
nett said. "If abortion had been readily avail-
able in 1970, I might have been an abortion." 

Dr. Bennett and Dr. Merrick leave the 
impression as well that they ace, for now, sim-
ply biding their time. There may come a day 
when they hold positions of power in which 
they can make more audacious, and perhaps 
more public, choices about how abortion is 
performed and researched, and how easily 1t 
can be obtained. One might wonder if these 
choices can be made from within an ivory 
tower.
