to Habitat, Brydon created a group of eight dedicated riders. They were 
the first Habitat Bicycle Challenge (HBC). That first cross-country ride 
was far from a vacation. The riders spent 12 weeks on the road, logging 
5,000 miles and carrying all their gear. When Brydon returned in the 
fall as a senior, he began planning immediately for the future of HBC. 
The first ride had been thrown together in just a few months, and did 
not live up to Brydon's expectations. 

Over the next five years, HBC grew under the leadership of Bry-
don, Garman, and others. Starting with the second ride in 1995, about 
30 cyclists rode from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, now with a 
support van ro hold their bags. This past summer, the ride's fifth year, it 
expanded to include a northern route from New Haven to Vancouver. 
The ability to find 60 riders and raise $100,000, twice as much as the 
previous year, signaled that the Bicycle Challenge was ready for the next 
level. "Would somebody just do it?" Brydon thought. "Incorporate it, 
tun it, take it to the level it finally belongs at?" But who could do that 
besides the man who first experienced and 
created HBC? "I felt compelled to realize 
the original vision." 

In the summer of 2000, hundreds of 
Habitat volunteers will set off on their 
bicycles, riding from San Francisco to 
Washington, D.C. Yet it is obvious that 
Brydon is not yet satisfied. "It's going to 
be the most substantial step forward for 
the Habitat Bicycle Challenge," he says, 
making clear that he sees this only as 
another growth spurt for the ride, not the 
final step. The two founders hope that the 
ride will expand to include a thousand riders and raise more than ten 
million dollars. 

A ride of this scale is something that has been done before. The 
GTE Big Ride debuted this summer, with almost 750 riders raising 
millions for the American Lung Association. But as Garman explains, 
the Bike and Build is unique. "It's not just a cycling event-it's a year-
long program." Each rider will not only raise money for his local chap-
ter, but will also work with the future homeowners to construct the 
house that he is funding. During the ride, cyclists and community 
members will gather to celebrate Habitat. HBC has been promoting 
Habitat in the communities it passes through since it began, and the 
Bike and Build founders hope to keep this interaction as ride participa-
tion increases. 

Committing to the Bike and Build right out of college was not easy. 
"My girlfriend thought I was crazy," Garman says of his decision. His 
friends and family had seen him spend weeks finding jobs in construc-
tion management, a field he had grown to love during his time with 
Habitat. Only six months ago, he spent his last Spring Break on a job-
searching trip to North Carolina. The trip was a success, and he 
returned to his last months at Yale enthusiastic about his future. But a 
week later, the construction jobs were forgotten and work on the Bike 
and Build had begun. 

The change seemed sudden, but the Habitat Bike and Build was 
the next logical step for someone who had already dedicated three years 
to Habitat. As a freshman, Garman spent a spring day working on a 
Habitat site. After hours of removing and replacing charred rafrers, he 
knew he wanted to spend more time on Habitat sites. "I came back 
totally dirty and smelly and just really loved it." 

As one of the few students who organized the Collegiate Build, 
Garman helped change the relationship between the Yale and New 
Haven chapters of Habitat. The Collegiate Build was the first house in 
the nation for which the fundraising and volunteer labor was provided 
solely by students. In spite of-or perhaps because of-the many 
doubts as to whether students could pull it off, the Collegiate Build 
House became a home in 1996 when the dedication was held and the 
Green family moved in. 

In the fall of 1995, just as the Colle-
giate Build was being organized, Gar-
man was asked by Brian Vogt (PC 
'96)-who became HBC director after 
Brydon graduated-to be a leader on 
HBC '96. It was his friendship with the 
soon-to-graduate Vogt that led Garman 
to accept the offer. Garman not only led 
the ride across the country, but also co-
directed HBC the following years. 

Garman's most significant mark on 
Habitat for Humanity, though, is the 
increased awareness of Habitat among 
Yale students. As a freshman counselor, Garman inspired many fresh-
men to become involved with Habitat. The night before the northern 
HBC group left New Haven in May, one of the riders asked "How 
many of us are here because of Jim Garman?" More than half of the 30 
riders raised their hands. 

In April, as graduation neared, Garman sat frustrated at his desk in 
Lawrance Hall. The enormous scope of the project was beginning to 
reveal itself "How do you find the company that makes semitrailers 
with showers inside?" When not working on his history thesis, Garman 
searched for answers to questions like that one--questions that HFHI 
might have for two twenty-somethings proposing a thousand-person, 
cross-country bicycle ride. 

They met with senior management at the HFHI headquarters in 
the spring. "There was hesitation," says Brydon. "The Bike and Build 
would be one of Habitat's most visible programs." In fact, the Bike and 
Build was poised to become the best publicity for Habitat since Jimmy 
and Rosalyn Carter first signed on almost 20 years ago, but its high pro-
file also made it a huge risk for a volunteer-based organization like 
HFHI. The risks were at least as great for the two young men who pro-

posed the idea . 

When Garman and Brydon arrived in 
Americus, each had spent many hours writing 
the Bike and Build business plan. But they 
hardly knew each other. There was the time at 
the celebration in San Francisco after Gar-
man's HBC ride; Brydon was still a Habitat 
cycling legend to Garman. "He doesn't 
remember the first time we met," says Gar-
man. "But you can imagine for me it was 
exciting to meet him." They spoke briefly in 
New Haven the next year, when Brydon was 
interviewing for the Habitat Executive Direc-
tor posicion. Since then their only contact had 
been over the phone. "I've written business 
plans with friends before," says Brydon. "This 
is the opposite. This relationship is driven by 
the idea." 

The two have found their differing sryles 
to be complementary: Brydon spent three 
years in the business world, Â· helping small 
Internet-based_ businesses establish them-
selves. Garman is different: a jacket and tie 
never look quite right on him. And Brydon 
himself will tell you that Garman is the calm 
one. "Jim is level-headed," he says, "while I'm 
excitable, temperamental." Their differences 
led to a narural division of labor. 'While Jim 
travels the highways of California, recruiting 
Habitat chapters to become involved, Brydon 
discovers the intricacies of incorporating a 
non-profit enterprise. "We're lucky we like 
each other," says Garman. 

But even with all of their differences, it 
comes as no surprise that they became friends 
as well as partners. Both are dedicated to the 
program, and- maybe more significantly-
both gave up a degree of securiry when they 
jumped into the Bike and Build. Each put a 
lot of work into the project before HFHI even 
gave their approval. 

In July, when HFHI first called Brydon 
and Garman and told them the good news, 
their reactions were quite different. Garman 
packed up his Plymouth Voyager and left his 
Kentucky home within a few days. HFHI's 
go-ahead was more than just the culmination 
of years of work for Garman, says Brydon. 
"Jim needed a job." And as the Bike and Build 
became realiry, it looked like he had one. "I 
told Antony I was driving right out to San 
Francisco," Garman says. "He was silent." 

Brydon was well-paid, loved what he was 
doing, and could make his own schedule. Last 
year, he took three months off to bicycle 
through India, Nepal,. and Ttbet-at the 
encouragement of his' employers. Running 
the bike challenge had never been easy. "HBC 
'94-'95 nearly crippled me," he says. He even 
considered both jobs, but realized that was 
impossible. "I thought, do I wane to do two 
jobs poorly or one job well?" After a few days, 
though, Brydon realized that he needed the 
Bike and Build, and it needed him. "Silicon 
Valley can survive without me." 

So the decision was made. Brydon 
informed his employer that he would be leav-
ing. "My business friends laughed at the idea 
of working for a non-profit." Only three years 
out of school, Brydon had left a great job 
most students would kill for. Garman was on 
his way to California to join him. 

"I was on top of the world," says Garman 
of his drive to the Bay Area. Even the death of 
Woody, his beloved van, only slowed him 
down by a day. Determined to keep going, 
Garman quickly found himself a used car. 
Like the gold seekers almost 150 years before 
him, he arrived with only what he could fit in 
his wagon (in this case, a Honda). By mid-
August, things were 'looking good for Gar-
man. "I use my key chain," he explains. "First 
it was empty. Then I got the car key. Now I 
have the office key and the one for the house" 
(where he's living with friends). It was finally 
happening. 

Originally eager for a 1999 premiere of 
the ride, the two soon realized that rushing 
the process was what had caused the first 
Bicycle Challenge to be such a difficult experi-
ence. Brydon and Garman made the tough 
decision to postpone the Bike and Build until 
the next year. "We have to step back, regroup, 
and give ourselves 18 months to make it 
work," says Garman. They are discovering 
that there is more to running a multi-milion 
dollar national business than hanging posters 
on bulletin boards and table tenting in the 
dining halls. What Brydon and Garman have 
always known, though, is that the ride will 
happen if they decide they want it to. "That's 
the single biggest lesson in all of this," Brydon 
says. "You have to go after it-it's not going to 
come to you."
