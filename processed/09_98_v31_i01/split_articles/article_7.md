New Haven in Focus 
I lived in New Haven, Connecticut, for a 
year before I could name more than seven of 
its streets. I lived by the New Haven Green, 
just two blocks from City Hall, for a year and 
never knew the mayor's name. I spent a year 
at Yale University thinking about test scores, 
boys, and parties; by the time my second year 
at Yale began, I was still lost in the city where I 
lived. 

Sophomores returning to Yale are expect-
ed to know their way around New Haven, but. 
for those like me who entered their seco~d 
year still befuddled by New Haven's politics 
and physical layout, FOCUS on New Haven 
stands alone co assist them. The name of Yale's 
only orientation for sophomores, Freshman 
Orientation to CommUnity Service, is as 
obsolete as the concept that only freshmen 
need orientations. When the program began 
six years ago as a week-long introduction for 
freshmen to New Haven and its community 
service opportunities, FOCUS failed. Con-
sisting of intensive manual labor service pro-
jects and highly-charged panel discussions, 
the program proved too much for freshmen 
still struggling co find their way around cam-
pus. "FOCUS for freshmen would be just 
another detail when everything is new," says 
FOCUS 
1998 
co-coordinator 
Margaret 
Sawyer (BK '99). 

While still operating in a diluted but 
effective form as Cityscape (a day-long orien-
tation for freshmen which consists of van 
tours, shon projects, and a community din-
ner), the original FOCUS no longer exists. 
After recovering from its initial failure, the 
regrouped program emerged with a stronger, 
more innovative angle. It decided to target 
Yale students who already knew enough about 
New Haven co develop an interest in finding 
out more. "If you're going to spend your time 
learning about a city, it's ridiculous to do so 
before you've spent some time in it," says 
Heidi Vogt (DC '99), rwo-cime leader and 
former participant. "People need to see that 
hole in their lives before they are ready to 
explore New Haven." 

FOCUS begins with panicipants learning 
about New Haven and its history through ., 
walking tours on the Green and van rides 
throughout the city. Later in the week, the 
entire group participates in a homelessness 
simulation and listens to panels of citizens 
and officials alike on the issues of Yale-New 
Haven relations, education, and city develop-
ment. For the last four days of the program, 
participants split into seven separate projects 
throughout the city. The projects range from 
building a porch for Habitat for Humanity to 
painting a mural at the caesar Jerez Catholic 
Workers Home. 

Far from the typical community service 
organizations run through Dwight Hall, Yale's 
service umbrella, FOCUS's main concern is 
its participants rather than urgent community 
needs. Restricted by time and the amount of 
work it can realistically accomplish in four 
days, the program seeks to encourage further 
interest in New Haven and community ser-
vice while maintaining the idea of working 
with, rather than for, 
the compiunity. 

"FOCUS isn't about privileged Yale students 
coming in and changing New Haven," says 
Vogt. "It's about preparing people to help 
New Haven solve its own problems." 

The motivation of FOCUS draws on the 
idea that Yale students can contribute to the 
community only when they see themselves as 
New Haven residents. Whereas participants 
in most service organizations spend an hour 
or two a week going into the community and 
coming back to Yale, panicipants in FOCUS 
spend the majority of their day outside of 
campus, riding city buses and even taking 
their meals at the Trinity Lutheran Church on 
Orange Street. "You're eating, breathing, and 
sleeping FOCUS. You don't have this other 
life that you go back to," says leader and for-
mer panicpant Hilary Kaplan (BR '00). 

For most panicipants, especially those 
who have never done community service, the 
FOCUS experience 
proves 
eye-opening. 

"FOCUS changed my attitude towards New 
Haven," says Eugenia Chen (DC '01). "I had 
never felt compelled to do community service 
before, but once you see a housing project in 
the middle of nowhere or pull hypodermic 
needles and bags of marijuana out of a river, 
you can't really turn away." 

Despite its success and the enthusiasm of 
its participants, FOCUS still operates on a 
small scale. This year only 65 sophomores 
applied for the program. Out of those panici-
pants, the majority were already active in 
Dwight Hall service or in New Haven report-
ing for the Yale Daily News. "For the average 
college student there's no real need to go out 
into New Haven," says Chen. "People go to 
college and want a fun college town. The 
immediate concerns of an average college stu-
dent are having a movie theater, some good 
restaurants, and something to do at night." 

Perhaps she is right, but "average college stu-
dents" are not supposed to attend Yale.
