B ONING UP ON THE A&F LIFESTYLE 
by Daniel Brook 
With an expected fall circulation of over one million, 
the admen who designed Abercrombie & Fitch's A & F 
Quarterry know they have a hit on their hands. Their 
publication may be the most widely read piece of 
junk mail in the history of the genre, or at least it 
seems to be within the. 06520 zip code .. The cata-
logue-cum-magazine can be found on common 
room coffee tables peacefully coexisting with Sports 
Illustrated and The New lOrker (whose circulation it 
exceeds by 200,000 readers despite a $10 "subscription 
fee," a cost mysteriously waived for Princeton students). 

Down at the ad agency, has all this success gone to their heads? No, 
that would violate the cardinal rule of the ''A & F lifestyle": never take 
yourself seriously. 

In his convened warehouse office in Greenwich Village, I spent an 
hour listening to Savas (surnames are so serious), a recent Vassar grad 
and brain behind the Quarterry, preach the gospel according to A & F. 
According to Savas, the tide of the summer issue, "Seeking Serious 
Fun," says it all. Don't let the cover photograph confuse you as it did 
me: I thought the gaunt model hosing down her buff but unthreaten-
ing male friend must be on some sort of hunger strike. As I soon 
learned, only people who take themselves seriously would assume 
something like that. She's just too busy seeking serious fun to take time 
out for meals. 

What sets the Abercrombie catalogue apart from the rest is its 
unique magazine section selling not clothes but "lifestyle" ---everything 
from what to listen co and read, to where to work and travel. Most 
striking about this "editorial section" (as Savas referred to it-I'm sure 
he didn't mean to come off sounding so serious) is how frequently it 
endorses things seemingly contrary to the fanatical consumerism of a 
company like Abercrombie. In the "Essential Summer Reading" sec-
tion, the QJulrterry suggests the Utne Reader, which bills itself as "the 
~ best of the alternative media." The Utne issue shown features a story 
~ attacking the corporate world-particularly youth-oriented clothing 
o companies-for co-opting hipness, neutralizing its rebellious anti-con-
~ sumerism and political radicalism. The Quarterry also endorses the 
~ fanzine Grand Royal crowing, "In the future we will all dress at thrifr 
~ stores if the editors of Grand RoyaL have their way."

"But not if A & F has its way?" I asked Savas. 
~ 
"Exactly," he replied. "It's kind of flippant." 
I was still confused. Sensing my bemusement, Savas invoked the 
cardinal rule: "You uy not to take yourself too seriously." 

Who has time to think about what one reads when there 
are so many shades of cargo pants to choose from? I 
guess if you're wondering why you're paying $30 for 
an A & F T-shirt instead of stopping by the Crown 
Street Salvation Army, you're taking yourself too seri-
ously. And if you go on to ponder why a T-shirt sells 
for $30 when the Third World kid who made it got 
paid two dollars per day, then you're really taking your-
self too seriously. 

But if you're even thinking about shirts this season, you're 
hopelessly gauche-anyone flipping through the A & F Quarterrywill 
come to the quick conclusion that men's shirts of any kind are not in 
style. Better save your 30 bucks for a gym membership (when shirts are 
out, pees are in) or two pairs of A & F boxer shorts. No shirts means 
exposed underwear elastic. And unless that elastic is emblazoned with 
"Abercrombie & Fitch," good luck getting the other boys to grope you. 

When I asked Savas why the A & F boys, living in an eternal sum-
mer of beautifully famished women, seem so interested in each other, 
he first tried pleading ignorance. "It's in the eye of the beholder," he 
tried to convince me, but he couldn't keep a straight face. Trying to 
stick to the party line, he added, "Straights see it as active and exciting, . 
and if you're gay or whatever you're gonna see it as homoerotic." Afrer I 
had clicked "Stop" on my tape recorder, Savas told it to me straight: 
"There is a lot of homoeroticism that goes on here, but it's not some-
thing we want to be known for," especially with the honchos at A & F 
headquarters in Ohio. 

Seen from Savas's Greenwich Village office, these corporate titans 
must appear to be taking themselves too seriously. The execs themselves 
would probably take a different view: in middle America it must appear 
that the Village set, with their demands for things like gay rights, are 
taking themselves too seriously. The A & F philosophy translates into 
blindly accepting whatever you've been brought up believing. Luckily 
for A & F, these days most everyone's been brought up to believe that 
you are what you buy. If the content of the Quarterry is in the eye of a 
beholder who doesn't take himself too seriously, A & F will do just fine. 

Savas said that he could "respect an article like the Utne Reader cover 
story, but it's a matter of how far you take it. You can only critique 
things to a certain extent and then you need to live your life." 
"And then you need something to wear?" I asked. 
"Exactly."
