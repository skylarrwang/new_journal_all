"You go to Yale, don't you? What are you doing here-Yale's the 
reason this place is being shut down. You can't come in here," threatens 
a menacing teenager as he blocks the door to the Daily Caffe. Someone 
flicks a cigarette butt at me and I brush through the doorway to a stac-
cato of taunting questions-"Are you on their side? Why are you stu-
dents letting this happen? Doesn't anybody care?'' 
It is the last Saturday night in August and instead of 
preparing for the busy fall season, the staff and patrons 
of the Daily Caffe are dismantling the store. Steve 
Shapiro, who owns the Daily with his wife Madeline, 
rescues me from the anti-Yale attacks and provides a seat 
amidst speakers, coffee machines, and artwork destined 
for the U-Haul outside. "Last night we were served with 
a notice that states that the sheriff is coming tomorrow 
morning at 7:30 to evict us," he says. "Yale did it this 
way so that we couldn't go to court. They're adamant 
that we leave." As he speaks a line forms next to us with 
patrons who express outrage and offer support. 
Shapiro distractedly thanks them for their concern 
and tries to direct the removal of the menu boards that 
line the wall behind the Daily's front counter. "Don't 
worry about the plastic-we can replace that-just don't ruin the 
boards," he says. "I would love to put those back up on Monday." With 
these words the buzz of conversation dies down, and Shapiro explains 
that there is a slight chance his attorney will find a way to postpone the ~ 
eviction. But even if this does happen, eviction is inevitable, as the g 
papers have already been served. 

The Daily has been in 6nancial trouble ever since Shapiro couldn't ;. 
pay Yale his rent last summer. "We suffered a lack of business because ~ 
of the competition that Yale put in-Willoughby's, 
Au Bon Pain, Bruegger's, Starbucks," he says. As the ~ 
only remaining independent coffee house in the 
Broadway area, the Daily was forced to compete with 
corporate coffee giants whose rent payments are ._ 
always guaranteed. The universiry assured Shapiro 3 
that he would not be forced out by chain stores, and 
would actually experience an increase in business. 
Not surprisingly, that never happened and Shapiro 
worked on plans to save his store. "Yale could have 
helped us. I was denied Flex dollars. They wouldn't 
give us a break on the rent. They could have helped us 
to expand and add a kitchen. With any of that I 
wouldn't be in this mess right now."

The scene at the Daily is only the latest in a series 
of muddled Broadway real estate decisions that span the last several 
years. This eviction is more surprising and dramatic than most, in part 
due to the populariry of the Daily as a hang-out for both Yale students 
and locals. "We made this a town/gown 
place," says Shapiro. "Everyone was welcome 
here." He's not idly praising himself-on any 
given night one could go to the Daily and 
find a mix of Yalies and New Haven natives. 
The art on display was just as likely to have 
been created by a Yale student as a local resi-
dent; the same goes for the bands that played 
there a few nights a week. So what would 
motivate Yale, who owns the Daily's building, 
ro evict this tenant? 

"Yale is accumulating square footage in 
the Broadway area to attract the kind of ten-
ants that students have said they want," says 
Joe Fahey, Director of Operations for Univer-
sity Properties. If that's correct then the string 
of real estate maneuvers made by the universi-
ty in the recent past seems incoherent at best. 
With Broadway store fronts remaining empty 
for years at a cime, one wonders exactly what 
mother Yale thinks her hen-pecked students 
want. "Those store fronts on Broadway 
haven't been vacant because of a lack of inter-
est," says Fahey. "It takes time to attract the 
type of tenant we would like to bring in." His 
words may very well be true, but with store 
fronts like that of Benson's Bakery remaining 
vacant for two and a half years, the district has 
developed the feel of a musical chairs game. 

In the last three years alone, just under the 
span of an undergraduate Yale career, Broad-
way has seen the exit of Benson's Bakery, the 
closing of Almost Wholesale, the departure of 
Dakota J's, the introduction of the Yale Book-
store, and the arrival of Bruegger's Bagels. 
One never knows what to expect afrer a sum-
mer away from campus. This year's surpr 
was Origins, a bath and body shop. As part 
a national chain, Origins confirms the tre.au 
that the additions made to Broadway will be 
corporate rather than independent. Consider-
ing how long the Origins' storefront remained 
vacant, it is difficult to believe that the univer-
sity thought a merchant hawking $8.50 bars 
of soap would best cater to student interest. 
The student reaction to Origins has been one 
of shock and confusion-we all know that 
they will make rent every month, but are they 
adding anything to the district? The Yale 
Bookstore already has a bath section that 
offers pricey soaps and other items that are of 
low appeal to college students. 

Even more puzzling have been the lease 
negotiations of Broadway's Store24, which is Â· 
both corporate-owned and a Yalie staple. Last 
spring, campus chatter shifted from upcom-
ing finals to the impending removal of 
Store24 afrer Rumpus broke the story. Four 
months 
later, 
Store24 
remains 
nestled 
between The Boola Boola Shop and the 
empty Almost Wholesale storefront, and 
negotiations continue. Its lease is up and 
everyone from Store24 president Robert Gor-
don to store manager Mary Crump knows 
that something is going to change in the next 
several months. "We don't know the status of 
the Broadway Store24," says Gordon. "Right 
now we're trying to arrange for a different 
space with the university. Yale has plans to 
redevelop the area where we are, including the 
building we're in." The only people who 
know the f.ue of Store24 work for University
