Cash Withdraws 
The circumstances were mysterious 
to say the least when Robin Cash, Yale's 
head coach of field hockey and women's 
lacrosse, announced her resignation on 
August 17, just two weeks before the 
field hockey team held its first practice. 
Cash, well-known for promoting both 
sports nationally, had coached field 
hockey to a 19-20-13 mark and lacrosse 
to a record of 28-23-1, including · an 
NCAA tournament berth this spring. 
Cash announced only that she decided 
to leave coaching for personal reasons 
and hoped to return to Yale in the fall as 
a special student. 

Six days later more of the story 
broke in a New York Times article head-
lined "Another Woman Resigns at 
Yale." Times reporter Lawrie Miffiin, a 
Yale graduate and the first captain of 
the field hockey team, wrote that Cash's 
departure raised "questions about the 
way female coaches are treated at Yale." 
Cash's resignation, wrote Miffiin, was 
the seventh coaching change affecting 
women's varsity sports since May. The 
former coach herself made the cryptic 
remark that in addition to personal 
reasons she left her job "because the at-
mosphere for coaches at Yale is such 
that I felt no reason to give it another 
year." 

Director of Athletics Frank Ryan 
strongly challenged Miffiin's reporting, 
heatedly calling the article "full of 
spurious information." "It's a gross 
misinterpretation of what goes on here," 
Ryan said. "She's writing in a very 
biased and one-sided way about a story 
that just isn't there. All I can think is 
that maybe Lawrie Miffiin is a friend of 
Robin Cash." 

Are women coaches at Yale badly 
treated? 
Maggie 
Muldoon, 
coach of women's varsity basketball and 
softball, thinks so; Yale declined to 
renew her contract over the summer. 
Muldoon feels she was let go because 
she was a vocal critic of Frank Ryan. 
"Women's athletics at Yale are a second 
class citizen," claimed Muldoon. "I was 
told by Frank Ryan when I was hired 
6 The New Journal/September 7, 1984 
program. 
Ryan 
accurately 
noted, 
~ "Almost all our coaches are involved in 
~ multi-assigments. Steve Griggs, for ex-
ample, is the coach of men's varsity soc-
j 
cer and tennis, while Michael Wald-
£ 
vogel is the men's varsity lacrosse coach 
~ and coach of freshman 
football." 
~ Griggs, however, is the only male coach 
f with two varsity coaching assignments.

secutively- unlike those of Dale 
Walker, the new lacrosse coach. She is 
also the women's varsity squash coach. 
Athletic Director Frank Ryan 
that varsity softball was not a priority. 
Women's basketball was a priority. 
Right away, that's unfair to the softball 
team. But having to coach two teams 
with overlapping seasons made it next 
to impossible to coach either one to their 
full potential." Muldoon added that 
recruiting was made especially difficult 
because of her back-to-back coaching 
responsibilities. 

Robin Cash not only agreed that two 
varsity coaching positions are too much 
for any coach, she also asserted that 
such duties were unequally assigned to 
female 
coaches of female 
teams. 
"There's no way you can handle two 
varsity teams fairly," Cash stated. "The 
administration can choose which teams 
to 
make 
successful. . Right 
now, 
women's athletics are . . . liveable. 
They certainly aren't what they could 
be." 

Frank Ryan flatly denied that he has 
de-emphasized the women's athletics 
The issue goes beyond that of propor-
tionate coaching responsibilities for 
men and women, however; Robin Cash 
alleged that women coaches are paid 
less than men coaches as well. But 
Frank Ryan maintained, "We decide 
our salaries by the marketplace and by 
the structure of salaries at Yale. We 
don't shortchange anybody." 

Though it is athletic department 
policy that salaries are strictly confiden-
tial, a New journal source indicated that 
while the highest-paid woman coach 
will earn less than $30,000 in 1984, no 
fewer than ten male coaches have 
salaries above that figure. In addition, 
the top-earning male coach will take 
home nearly J40,000 more than the 
highest-paid woman. The statistics by 
themselves are hardly conclusive, but 
they do lend credence to Cash's state-
ment: "In 
the athletic department 
there's a feeling of 'Oh, it's only a 
women's sport.'" 

Frank Ryan declined to comment on 
these figures. 

Meanwhile the field hockey team 
continues practicing, hoping to insulate 
its season from this administrative tur-
bulence. Nonetheless, they are well 
aware of the disputes over their athletic 
program. According to Lucy Bernholz, 
four-time 
varsity 
player and 
women's lacrosse captain for 1985, "You 
see all these women coaches leave and it 
makes you think, 'What's going on?' I 
can't say for sure if the administration 
prompted Robin's resignation, but if 
they did, then there's something wrong 
with the administration."
