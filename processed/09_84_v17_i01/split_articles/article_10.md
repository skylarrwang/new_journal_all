One letter read, "A pox on you! Oh 
for the days when Yale was for men." 
"Does Yale want to be the leader of the 
Decline and Fall of the USA?" asked 
another "I wasnever too enthusiastic 
about Yale going coeducational but 
this is the last straw." These diatribes 
are a few of the 11 6 letters the Yale 
Alumni Magazine and Journal (Y AMJ) 
has received over the past six months 
in response to an ad in its February 
issue for Yale Gay and Lesbian Alum-
ni {GALA). 

Yale GALA, formed in spring 1982, 
bought the half-page ad to publicize its 
existence and programs, such as reu-
nion activities and aid to campus 
organizations "in their efforts to make 
Yale a better place for lesbian and gay 
students, faculty and staff." YAMJ ac-
cepted the ad, according to Editor AI 
Mitchell, because "the content was not 
inappropriate; there was nothing ob-
jectionable." YAMJ Advertising 
Manager Susan Fox noted that gay 
student organization s have run small 
ads in the past without causing any 
reader response. 

The initial response was entirely 
hostile, but the response to the indig-
nant letters was even larger, and Mit-
chell calculates that overall the letters 
are nearly three to one in support of the 
ad or the organization . GALA has been 
encouraged by the response it has 
received; membership has doubled to 
over 450 since the ad was printed, and 
there are GALA chapters in New 
Haven, New York. San Francisco. 
Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia 
and Maine. GALA has members from 
classes from 1929 to 1987, representing 
all of Yale's graduate schools and faculty 
and staff members as well as the Col-
lege. 

. For the first time GALA participated 
tn the University reunions in June. 
Events included a brunch and a picnic 
as well as a speech by History Professor 
John Boswell on "Gay People and the 
University." GALA events were attend-
ed by 70 people. many of whom were 
not there for their own reunions. In the 
reunion process GALA again ran afoul 
of older alumni. Each class secretarv 
can choose which information on non~ 
class activities to include in alumni 
registration 
packets. 
and only the 
classes of 1969. 1974 and 1979 induded 
the GALA material. 

According to Corey Friedlander. SM 
'74, a GALA member who organized 
reunion events. the Association of Yale 
Alumni (A YAr has been very suppor-
tive. at lt'aSt 
logistically. 
"They've 
treateu us just as they would any other 
alumni organization. That's the best we 
can hope for." he said. Official Univer-
'ity poli<:y is guided by the Yale Cor-
poration 
Equal Opportunity Policy 
~tclling that Yak· is commi11ed to 
.. resptTting an individual's attitudes on a 
variety of mauers that are essentially 
personal in nature." 

In October YAA-U will publish two 
further reader k11crs bringing the total 
number of lellt'rs publisht·d to 48. the 
first time YAA-U has not published all 
readt•r kllt•rs . .. This is a larger response 
than ~e·n· had 10 .1nything before." said 
Mitchdl. "t'\'t'n when Yale gave Ja<.·k 
Kt•nnedy an honorary deRrt>t'."
