The New journal, · a magazine of news 
and features about Yale and New 
Haven, p~blishes six times a year and 
is distributed free to all members of the 
University community. Founded in 1967, 
it discontinued publication in 1979 and 
was revived with a new format in 1981. 
We now print letters to the editor,. which 
we welcome at all times; Newsjournals, 
short new stories or followups of past 
articles; 
Between 
the · Vines, 
a 
thoughtful commentary or humorous 
essay about life behind the scenes at 
Yale; feature 
stories 
and section 
pieces: architecture, arts, books, pro-
file, sports and theater. Afterthought, 
our final essay, is usually written by an 
expert in a field of interest to the Yale 
community. Throughout, we aim to 
bring you thought-provoking and enter-
taining journalism. 

The September issue comes to you 
from all over the country. We started 
·' 
and Public Risks 
. 
A New Chapter in the AIDS Debate 
working on itin April and continued all 
summer. Parts were Federal Ex'pressed 
from Cincinnati, Ohio. One story was 
edited near the downtown lion of the 
New York Public Lib.rary, another was 
polished on a train from Washington, 
·D.C. Most of the staff arrived August 20 
to put this issue together, and we are 
starting work on the October magazine 
now. We welcome new ideas and new 
faces. 

The New Journal has all the en-
thusiasm of a brand new magazine, 
and for a three-year-old publication 
we've already established a reputation 
for quality writing. Recently, for ex-
ample, 
former 
~ditor-in-chief W. 
Hampton Sides '84 won the Rolling Stone 
Colfege Journalism Award for in-
vestigative journalism for his story on a 
New Haven prostitute who was a 
suspected AIDS carrier. 60 lvfinutes aired 
an investigation of his story, which ap-
peared on the cover of our December 
issue. In addition, former New Journal 
editors Paul Hofheinz and Morris 
Panner '84 won the English depart-
ment's Wright Prize for a journalistic 
or descriptive article for "Letters from 
Quang Tri," their documentation of 
Dick Pershing '66, who died in the 
Vietnam War. The article appeared in 
our March special issue on the war. In 
the past two years, four New Journal 
writers have won this award. 

Read and enjoy this issue. We'd like 
to hear your opinions and your ideas. 
We'd likeyour proposals for future ar-
ticles. We'd like your help in the 
business department to keep The New 
Journal completely advertiser-
supported. And we'd like to see you at 
our organizational 
meeting on 
September 10.
