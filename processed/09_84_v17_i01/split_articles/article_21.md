Dressed in all their hardware they 
seem to be participating in a social 
movement born long ago and far a~ay 
from New Haven. While the local kids 
with their strange haircuts and torn 
clothing physically 
resemble their 
radical 
British predecessors, 
the 
ideological similarities are few. Nevertheless, the cores' visual suggestion of 
anarchy as well as occasional clashes 
with the Yale community have caused 
great friction. The teenagers have trouble with nearly everyone from the Yale 
and New Haven police to students, 
from the proprietors of N a pies to the 
masters of residential colleges. The 
cores have been hanging out at Yale for 
about a year, but a distance remains 
between the people who live and work 
here and the children who visit the cam-pus for several hours a day. Apparently 
this distance will not vanish soon. 
The University's acres of spires and 
courtyards make these high schoolers 
look all the more incongruous, the 
latest in metal and leather juxtaposed 
with 1930s Gothic. The contrast is 
stark: ten boys and girls in combinations of black and grey Salvation Army 
wear gather in Beinecke Plaza in front 
of the University war memorial. Talking and rummaging for cigarettes, the 
kids seem oblivious to passing camera-toting families who, like most people, 
involuntarily take a quick glance at the 
group. 

Despite their regalia 
most of the 
cores still look young, too young according to some to take such drastic steps 
with their bodies and their wardrobes. 
"We represent a defiance of the norm, 
of acceptance," explains fifteen-year-old Claire Bauermeister. Most of her 
hair, save a reddish-brown tuft at the 
forehead, is wrapped in dark cloth. 
Her 
rectangul~r eyebrows and the 
rhinestone in her left nostril make her 
round face look almost exotic. "Our 
clothing is an extension of our personalities. We just don't want to be like 
everybody else." 

Beyond a general sense of nonconformity, few cores dress to make any 
deeper social or political statement. 

Not on MTV 
Unlike the English punks of the mid-seventies, the New Haven kids seldom 
see a connection between mohawks and 
anger. "I dress this way because I like 
the way it looks," says Becky Tupper, 
gazing towards Woodbridge Hall. "It's 
comfortable. There's 
not anything 
behind it for me or for a lot of people." 
"I'm really not into politics," says 
Mike Lawrence, the boy in the Clash 
T-shirt sitting next to Claire. "I guess 
I'm just into having a good time." He 
smiles, showing a mouthful of braces. 
"But it's impossible not to have 
politics behind this," objects Damon, his 
quiet, clenched voice now more 
animated. "There is politics behind 
everything. There are some people, 
though, who are just not very political 
and who don't like to think of what they 
do as mass change."

Although the New Haven punks often 
remain apart from issues and ideology, 
hardcore music deals substantially with 
war and Reaganism, teenage rebellion 
and rage. According to John Lynch, a 
20-year-old core, the driving, unintelligible music draws kids to hardcore 
by providing an alternative to routine 
FM radio fare. "The music is definitely 
the rallying call," Lynch explains. He 
wears a black shirt, hiding all but a purple lock of his hair. "Hardcore starts 
with hearing something that differs 
from the norm. It then gets you listening to the lyrics, which are the most important part of the music. The music is 
anger, but anger in a fun way." 

John Lynch has opinions on all 
aspects of hardcore, and in May 1983 
he began writing a series of broadsides 
about developments 
in 
the New 
Haven punk community. Aptly titled 
"Not on MTV ," installments of Lynch's 
commentary- which 
can 
be found 
plastered to telephone poles and store 
walls- cover everything from 
emergence of new bands to incidents 
of harassment. In a September 1983 
issue entitled "What is Hardcore?" 
Lynch states, "The most important 
aspect of hardcore is that it questions-even itself. Most cores agree that 
it's not so much what you're thinking, 
but that you are thinking-and taking a 
stance." Accordingly there are many 
stances and attitudes under the umbrella of hardcore: Anti-Social ("Basic 
dislike of human beings") to Straight-Edge ("Keeping your wits about you 
and doing something positive"), anarchism to pacifism.

Lynch's posters with interest and nod in 
agreement, others feel that few of the 
philosophies he has listed actually exist 
among the 
New Haven hardcore. 
Rather, some feel that their friends are 
only concerned with hanging out and 
getting stoned. Sonja Dove, daughter of 
Pierson Dean Christa Dove, states matters sharply. "Some people 'exist' and 
think that's cool. When they have 
money they spend it all on beer," she 
says with mild annoyance. "There 
seems to be an angry attitude amongst 
the New Haven hardcore, but I really 
don't know what they're angry at: New Haven is a real 'talk town'. People 
here talk a lot about getting bands 
together but they never do anything." 
Sonja's close friend Damon Ortega 
agrees. "I don't just want to have a 
mohawk and tattoos. It's kind of a 
waste. I see people who could have done 
more than have fun on weekends." 

Damon says as he lets his voice trail off. 
Perhaps more than other cores, 
Damon is always creating plans. Right 
now his most radical scheme is to join 
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) 
within the next few years. Despite his 
Hispanic surname Damon comes from 
a predominantly Irish-Catholic family 
which has long supported- both financially and morally- the IRA's cause. "I 
may go after high school. There's a lot 
left to experience here, and I may not 
be ready to get killed just yet," he explained. "I agree that a lot of what they 
do is terrorist, but I wouldn't do terrorist things if I joined. I would never 
plant a bomb in a square and watch 
hundreds of people blow up." He stops 
and looks at his left forearm, on which 
he has written "I'm no puppet" and 
"Personality conflict." "But in a sense I 
guess I have been supporting terrorism 
by sending them money."

While many of the original British 
punks came from urban slums, most of 
the New Haven teens live in middle-class communities like Woodbridge and 
Hamden. Many of their parents are affiliated with the University, either as 
alumni or employees. Damon grew up 
in New Haven, acting at the Yale Rep 
and taking violin lessons, and he attended the Loomis-Chaffee School until 
January 
1984. 
His 
father, Jorge 
Ortega, graduated from Yale in 1971 
and now works in the engineering 
department of the language lab. During 
his undergraduate years both Jorge 
and his wife, Leslie Arthur, belonged to 
the hippie movement. Therefore, they 
try to understand and accept Damon's 
involvement in hardcore. "Damon has 
his own kind of lifestyle, as we did. But 
he's more sophisticated at his age than 
we were," says Leslie. She takes a puff 
of her cigarette and passes it on to her 
husband. "I'm not crazy about his haircut, though. He's a great looking kid, 
but he tries to the best of his ability to 
look like crud." 

Leslie believes that she and Jorge instilled the beliefs of the hippie movement in Damon and his younger sister 
Megan. "We taught them to question 
authority, because we always did. The 
kids always find wrongs in the world," 
she continues. "Damon is very moral in 
his attitudes about everything, especially justice. In a lot of ways, I'd like for 
him to stay as he is. I think he has a lot 
of courage to do what he does." 

Unlike Damon's parents, 
many 
others wish their hardcore children 
would grow back their hair, put on 
Izods and burn their Dead Kennedys 
albums. "When I shaved my head, my

parents refused to take me to restaurants, to anywhere," recalls Mike, 15, 
whose hair is now a quarter-inch tall. 
"Though my dad loves it now, he initially thought we were neo-Nazis," says 
Laura. "But my mom hates it. She even 
cried over my haircut." Laura brushes 
aside a shock of platinum hair which 
covers her right eye and part of her 
white-powdered cheek. 

As the others speak Greg walks over 
from Wall Street and sits on the outskirts of the 
Despite 
his 
mohawk, his smooth face and slight 
build give away his fourteen years. He 
wears a sleeveless jean jacket with a hot 
pink "Impeach Reagan" button stuck on 
the pocket. Around his neck hangs a 
stiff silver choker with a large plain 
medallion. 

"My mom went hippie years ago and 
she has tons of jewelry that I can 
wear," he says, fingering the disk. He 
pauses and his grin disappears. "I don't 
get along with my mom so well. She 
says that she doesn't find me attractive 
anymore. 'You're not the apple of my 
eye anymore.'"

Although Greg remains upset about the 
situation with his mother, he nonetheless admits that he willingly tries to 
look disturbing and unappealing. "The 
clothing is to provoke- there's no question about it," he says; alluding to the 
upside-down crosses drawn on his jeans. 
"I'm mirroring the world through how I 
dress. The way I look isn't pretty, but 
the most important thing I do is show 
people how ugly the world is." 

While Greg's appearance is not as 
radical as some of the older cores', he 
still seems to antagonize people with 
what he wears. "Being treated like shit is 
a relatively new thing for me," he says, 
smiling. "I constantly get dirty looks 
from people. Their first instinct is to 
laugh in my face. They think I'm ruining my life. They look at us as if we're 
social abortions. They'd probably like to 
send us to their pope. They'd beg, 'No 
more abortions, no more punks.'" 

"The thirty-cents lady thinks I'm the 
anti-Christ," says Brad Davidson, who 
has been sitting quietly next to Greg. 
"The harassment gets to a point 
where we expect it," Damon says as he 
crushes out his latest in a series of 
cigarettes. "A night never goes by when 
we're not hassled." 
"I love to turn heads, though," Becky 
says. "It's fun to have people look at 
you." 
"Yeah, but not when people drive by 
at sixty miles an hour and yell 'asshole' 
out their window," says Damon. 

Occasionally 
both the cores and 
their critics take that decisive step 
beyond name calling and staring and 
quickly get drawn into a volatile situation. Prior to his spray-painting adventure Damon got involved in a fight at 
Yorkside because, he claims, a drunken 
man shoved his friend. "Earlier this 
summer, a 
bunch of us were at 
Yorkside, and Laura was waving a small 
American flag. Then this big bow-tied 
man walked over and began lecturing 
us about respect for the flag. The man 
wouldn't have done anything if we were 
dressed like everyone else. He was obviously drunk," Damon explained. 
"Brad mumbled to leave us alone and so 
this guy grabbed Brad, dragging him 
and the table forward. So of course we 
lost all our food. Then the management 
got mad at us and wondered how we 
could fight with this reverend. The man 
walked out of the place as if he'd done 
nothing, so I ran outside and pushed 
him down. He pushed a friend of mine 
and threatened me. Luckily, some people coming out of Toad's stopped me 
and calmed me down." 

Despite the incident the teenagers 
can again hang out at Yorkside, which, 
like many other restaurants, evicted the 
kids with regularity several months ago. 
"Last year, everything was great until 
December or January when we got 
thrown out of Naples," remembers 
Becky. "Maybe the people at Naples 
spread the word to other places, because 
we couldn't buy food anywhere 
anymore." 
"We've been thrown out of every 
place imaginable," complains Glynis 
Rochelle in her rushed, excited way. 
"Other teenagers who hang around 
downtown are never treated like this. If 
we walked into Naples with shetlands 
and loafers on, they'd never throw us 
out. All they said to us was, 'We don't 
serve your kind here. We don't like 
your kind.' Well, what is our kind?" 

As Naples Pizza's manager John 
Cirillo explains, Glynis' kind loiters in 
his restaurant for hours at a time, buying little food and dirtying the tables. He 
denies that his establishment discriminates against the children because of 
their appearance. "We serve them like 
anyone else. But they're making a hangout of this place, and we're a restaurant, 
not a hang-out," says Cirillo.
