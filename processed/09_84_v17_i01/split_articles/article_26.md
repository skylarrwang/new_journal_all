"I enjoy writing under 'Danny San-
tiago,"' .James said. "It's something fresh 
and new in life. I wanted a 'we' feeling. 
How could a .Jorgensen or a Smith write 
ahout Chato's life?" H e explained fur-
ther in a letter to his friend John 
.Gre~ory Dunne, who wrote the New 
York Rtview '!f Books article with .James' 
consent: "[Santiago is] so much freer 
than [ am myself. He seems to know 
how he feels ahout everything and has 
none of the ifs, ancls and buts that I'm 
plagut·d with . . . I can't let him go. 
~1 aybe he'll prove a strait-jacket later 
.on. We'll se<·-" 

J ames eventually grew frustrated at 
not being able to meet his fans or talk 
to his editor and critics. "I was getting 
interesting mail as Danny Santiago 
and it bothered me not to be able to see 
the people who were writing. I felt 
claustrophobic, I felt trapped. Now the 
result is most gratifying for a man who 
was forgotten, a pseudo-writer," he 
says of his transformation from a post 
office 
box number. "Anyway, 
it 
wouldn't have taken a detective to find 
out who Danny Santiago was."
