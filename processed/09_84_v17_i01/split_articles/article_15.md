EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Borivong, a 33-year-old veteran of the 
loyalist Laotian army, studies a home 
electricity manual. Speaking in a per-
cussive tenor with a heavy accent, he 
explains to his tutor, "I am training for 
new job in m achine shop. Have to study 
the 
basic 
math. 
I 
got 
ques-
tion-can you please explain me, how 
you write in number, 'three hundred 
thousandths?"' They continue discuss-
ing vocabulary from the manual. 

The steep, creaking stairs lead to the 
second noor containing several rooms, 
some no larger than big broomclosets. 
Phengta's wife Bounpha, whom he 
married in Laos before the Southeast 
Asian wars, has been coming to ACS 
with their three young children for 
over a year to meet her K orean-
American 
tutor 
Heiwon, 
a 
Yale 
senior . At a wood desk by a dusty win-
dow, 
two 
look 
at 
Bounpha's 
vocabulary homework from the adult 
education class she attends in D erby. 
The two also use the classified section 
of the New Havm Register to improve 
vocabulary and keep up with job op-
portunities. 

From a list of words Bounpha asks 
the meaning of"ditch." The tutor says, 
"When you wanted to bring water from 
the river to the crops, but the river was 
too far away, you might have dug" (she 
mimes the action of digging) "a ditch 
from the river to the fields." Bounpha 
laughs. "I see." She had come from an 
agricultural province in Laos. 

"I'm happy that I can give her prac-
tical help," H eiwon explains. "She has 
told me about going to the bank and 
not understanding when the teller ask-
ed for her initials. The teller became 
impatient and Bounpha got confused. 
So every new word she learns to use 
becomes such a concrete a nd ap-
plicable bit of knowledge. She wants to 
Improve her ability to communicate 
with co-workers at her factory and peo-
ple at her children's school." 

Down the hall toward the back of the 
house, two women leaf through an art 
history book. The student, Linda Tin, 
petite 
24-vear-old Chinese-
Cambodian, has recently immigrated 
to New H aven from the Kaoidanl{ 
refugee camp in Thailand. She is 
working toward a degree from South 
Central Community College. 
H er 
English, 
which 
she 
learned 
in 
dialogues with a pastor in the camp. is 
clear and comprehensible after less 
than a year in the United States. She

"It's like life- so many different col-
ors put together in different ways. This 
man know the life. Some people praise 
the life and some abuse the life. Why? 
Just because they live in different 
''avs . 

.:In Asia, a big problem is the in-
nuence of \\Testern culture on society. 
Now many children are learning to 
become independent, and this huns 
their parents. In Cambodia and many 
other countnes of Asian culture 
children do not leave home. Parents 
help educate their children, and old 
people taik so much to the young peo-
ple. 

"My parents always wanted us to get 
the good education, and ~e wouid 
have left Cambodia to find the good 
education. Because of the war, we did 
·not get to finish school." Alluding to 
forced labor in Pol Pot's camps and 
forty-kilometer compulsory marches, 
she says. "My people have seen the hell 
of life. 

"A person who live in the heaven of 
life may say 'Life is so sweet' and the 
person who livt· in the hdl of life may 
"ay 'Lilt• i" so bittt•r.' Tht· life has for-
tunes and unfortunes, sour. sweet. bit-
ter and hot mix up liule by little. 

"I lovt' the art, becaust• it shows the 
different attitudt•s of life. This paint in~ 
is like the life, so bright, and not so 
perfect.~
