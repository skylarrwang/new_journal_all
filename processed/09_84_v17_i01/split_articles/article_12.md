Reid Beyond the Facts 
How safe is it to be a visiting speaker at 
Yale? At least one recent guest lecturer 
will probablv sti< k to writing insa·ad of 
speaking from now on. ~ven the alter-
math of his last appearance on campus 
and the damm~e dont> to his reputation. 
In March t<l8:l 
Alastair Reici. a 
veteran writer at the Sm >'nrk". "poke 
in a college '-t'lllinar spon-.orTcl by 
Ezra Stiles 
and Jonathan 
l-:Ciwards 
entitled "The Ri~t to Write and the 
Perils of Print." Reid- ' isited at the in-
vitation of the 
imtnJCtor. 
Joseph 
Cooper. editori;t) <ounsel to the \'m• 
York". Reid di~t<>med the thin lim• be-
tween fact and fiuion and the jour-
nalistic problems it presents, ntmg ex-
amples from several of his own articles. 

On .June 18, 1984 .Joanne Lipman '83, 
a student in Cooper's seminar who is 
now a Wall Strut Journal reporter, de-
noum-..·cl Reid in a front-page artide. 
"He has sp<·nt his career creaung com-
posite tales and scenes, fabri<·ating per-
sonae, rearranging events and creating 
conversations in a plethora of pieces 
presented as non-fiction," she wrote. In 
Cboper's seminar Reid had discussed 
much of the material in Lipman's story, 
including the four examples she cited 
from his work in the Nrw York". 

Reid has not denied that he use<l 
composites in the stories Lipman cited, 
but he felt 
that Lipman took his 
remark-; out of their proper context. The 
Wall Sturt.fournal article presented such 
statements as "The implication that fact 
is precious isn't important . . . . Readers 
who are factual-minded are the readers 
who arc least important," without men-
tioning the setting in which Reid made 
them. The examples from his work, he 
said in a .July letter to the Nrw York 
Timrs, "were volunteered by me in a 
seminar ... as exceptional cases ... in 
,..,.hich [ had chosen to depart from strict 
factual 
at-curacy. 
rea<;ons 
that. 
while dear to mr. were arguable. argu-
ment being what ·seminars are meant to 
stimulate.~ C:oopen-oncurrcd that Reid 
had prt''~<'ntecl his rearran({l'ment of facts 
as "ddinitdv dt>batable." "He did not 
advonut• t lw use of t-ompo-.itt'" as a<·-
n·ptablt'. 
rt•<·ommended journalistic 
procedure." Cooper said, contr;ory to 
the impression conveyed in Lipman's 
a rticle. 

Lipman denied that her artide was 
bast·d on material from Reid's seminar 
presentation, which other students in the 
class said thev had assumed to be ofT the 
record. Although she first met Reid in 
Cooper's seminar. she said. "Absolutely 
nothing in my.June 18 Wai/Strul.fournal 
article was taken from the class. The ar-
ticle was based on a series of on-the-
record interviews with Mr. Reid con-
ducted in my capacity as a Wall Stmt 
Journal reporter. Every example and 
every Reid quotation in my article 
came from those interviews." 


Yet Cooper believes that Lipman 
would never have b.een able to write her 
article if she had not heard Reid speak 
at Yale. He indicated that when she in-
terviewed Reid subsequently, she in-
troduced herself as a form.er student of · 
Cooper's and that Reid considered their 
conversations an 
extension of the 
seminar's philosophical and theoretical 
discussion. "It's not clear to me that 
Alastair was aware that he was being 
profiled and that Joanne was writing 
about him. If he had known he was go-
ing to be set up for ridicule he would not 
have been so congenial or generous 
with his time." Reid declined to com-· 
menton his interviews with Lipman. 

Lipman's article led to a full-blown 
scandal in the New York journalistic 
community. The New York Times ran a 
front-page news story about Reid, as 
well as. a feature on journalistic use of 
composites and an editorial attacking 
the New Yorker. "The end of the world 
seems near," the Times proclaimed, 
"now that our colleagues at the New 
Yorker, that fountainhead of unhurried 
fact, turn out to tolerate, even to justify, 
fictions masquerading as fact." 

In a memo issued to the staff of the 
New Yorker, editor William Shawn flatly 
denied that the magazine condones the 
use of composites, invented characters 
or altered facts in its non-fiction pieces. 
In using these techniques, Shawn said, 
Reid "violated New Yorker principles" 
and "made a journalistic mistake." 

Joyce Richter, media manager of 
the New Yorker, commented that Lip-
man made an "unfortunate statement" 
when she accused Reid of spending his 
"career" departing from the facts, when 
only four examples were actually in-
volved. Two of the pieces appeared in 
the magazine's "Talk of the Town" sec-
tion, where what Shawn's statement 
termed "characters ~nvented in the spirit 
of fun" are permissible and assumed to 
be understood as fictional by the 
magazine's readers. A third article cited 
by Lipman was a 1961 "Letter from 
Barcelona" in which Reid moved a 
scene from a friend's living room to a 
"small, flyblown bar by the harbor " in 
order to protect his sources from repri-
sals during the Franco regime. Richter 
said that it is acceptable New Yorker · · 
practice to protect a source in this man-
ner and that Reid stated that he 
camouflaged scenes to respect people's 
privacy in several of his stories about 
Spain. She said Reid's only real error 
had been in the fourth of Lipman's ex-
amples, where a conversation with a 
Spanish cab driver was transplanted 
from one cab ride to another. 

Adam Liptak '84, a 
student in 
Cooper's seminar and former editor of 
the Yale Daily News Magazine, said "Reid 
was crucified for what was a relatively 
min or transgression." He believes that 
had Reid not been at ·the New Yorker, 
there would have been no scandal and 
that the desire to deflate the magazine's 
self-importance led to what he called in 
a letter to the Times the "malicious New 
Yorker-bashing that went on in the wake 
of this affair on the part of an entire pro-
fession." 

"I don't think Joanne knew how juicy 
the story was until later, when the Times 
picked it up," Liptak commented. Still,. 
by omitting the context of the seminar 
from her article, he said, "She did Reid 
a serious disservice and made him look 
worse than he deserved to look." 

Cooper pointed out the irony that 
although Lipman attacked Reid's ambi-
guity about his sources, she had failed 
to disclose the sources of her own art-
icle. 

Because the intention of the 
seminar was to provide "uninhibited, 
robust, provocative discussion," Cooper 
said Lipman should have indicated it as 
a source of her story. He also noted that 
when he gave the seminar previously, 
in 1980 and 1981, Reid gave essentially 
the same talk, using some of the same 
examples from his work. 

Along with Cooper, several students 
in the seminar expressed their concern 
that the Reid incident might inhibit 
future guest speakers from coming to 
Yale or at least from speaking freely 
here. Abby Burman, JE '86, said, 
"Cooper's seminar was great because it 
got down to the nitty-gritty. If there had 
been restraints, it wouldn't have been as 
good."
