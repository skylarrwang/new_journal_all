he was on leave. Upon his return he 
immediately offered Morse as a home 
for the itinerant Lipstick. A petition cir-
culated in the college indicated student 
approval of the offer. At the same 
time, Smith College showed an interest 
in Lipstick, but could not compete with 
Yale's bid. 

Oldenburg was understandably 
hesitant to return the monument to 
Yale after the treatment it had received 
before. 

Brewster was also 
unen-
thusiastic, saying he would not object if 
a site ,(or the sculpture could be found 
("though he said it wasn't his favorite 
piece of sculpture and he'd been told by 
people it was a practical joke at Yale's 
expense," Shestack said.) Twenty-five 
donors gave nearly $15,000 to pay for 
rebuilding the 
monument. The 
original fiberglass tip was retained, but 
the aluminum tube and the steel base 
were refurbished and the crumbling 
plywood treads remade in steel. 

LipsticJCs second reception differed 
markedly from its first. The University 
had 
never formally 
accepted"'- the 
original monument; now it had per· 
suaded 'the artist to restore it, paid for 
the work, accepted the gift through the 
Art Gallery, and staged an exhibit 
there in commemoration of the new 
gift. "I was very happy with the change 
in reaction," Oldenburg said. "It said 
something about whllf' the first installa-
tion had accomplished." 

October 17, 197 4 was Ascension 
Day for Lipstick. A group of students 
put a large plastic pair of lips next to 
the sculpture, many of the men wore 
lipstick in honor of the occasion and 
the Yale band played. "I thought it was 
the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen," 
said Scully, who had wanted to put the 
sculpture on the hill, threatening the 
dining hall. Oldenburg spoke to the 
gathering from 
the base 
of his 
sculpture, removing his shoes out of 
respect. "I hope you'll take your shoes 
ofT when you ruse it as a speaker's plat-
form]." He joked, "I'm very happy 
you're going to take care of this 
because I can't fit it into my loft. Here, 
it turns on the sky." 

Most of those involved with the 
originaJ Lipstick are pleased with its
