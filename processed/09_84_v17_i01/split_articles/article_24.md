EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Ken, now 67, with warm blue eyes and 
grey hair, recalls helping his father 
grind meat, but did not assume full 
raponsibility as owner until 195 J. 
Though at one time he had hoped to go 
to college, he recognized his respon-
sibility to both family and business and 
stuck with the Lassen tradition. A 
smile creases his face as he recalls fall-
ing in love with the lunchroom. "I'm 
actually a frustrated architect," he ad-
mits cheerfully, "but I needed to sup-
pon my family, and I realized the in-
teUigent thing was to work at what you 
knew." Fortunately, Ken knew how to 
cook. 


World War II interrupted Ken's 
work. He spent four and a half years 
in the Air Force and finished his tour 
of duty in India by teaching supply ser-
vice, the military counterpart to run-
ning a luncheonette. In Ken's absence 
his father, stepmother and uncle ran 
Louis' Lunch. They faced the hardship 
of a wartime black market- a group of 
unscrupulous merchants who tried to 
profit from the bad times by charging 
exorbitant prices. Rather than do 
business with these men, Louis' closed 
down for two years. At the end of the 
war, 
Ken returned and reopened 
Louis' with a clear conscience. 


But Louis' Lunch had not yet had its 
fill of public controversy. It:t 1975 the 
lunchroom, then located at 202 George 
Street, found itself in the middle of a 
~evelopment dispute. The entire 
block was to receive a facelift and in 
the process the redevelopment agency 
IOught to expel the Lassens. Mostly 
made up of doctors, this group found 
the presence of a hamburger rest-
aurant inappropriate and distasteful, 
and threatened to pull out of the pro-
ject if the luncheonette remained. An 
enormous public outcry ensued in 
Which patrons flew to the defense of the 
popular establishment. Lassen recalls 
l'eceiving mail from all over the coun-
try. "We even had a group of sup-
~ners down in Washington," he notes 
IQ amazement. Yet in spite of his great 
popularity, Ken was forced to take his 
lhow on the road. The building was 
moved to 261-263 Crown Street on ju-
ly 29, 1975. 


"Could I have some ketchup?" she inquires. 
Pandemonium. 


Ken threw himself into designing 
this new building, a project which soon 
became an obsession. "I can't tell you 
how many sleepless nights we spent 
trying to keep the place small," he says. 
Lassen himself drafted and measured 
the additions for the original Crown 
Street structure. In making his design 
he wanted a larger building with the 
same small-room feeling of the George 
Street building. Ken assembled a 
talented team to achieve this goal. 
"Everybody worked tOgether to achieve 
this building," he fondly remembers:-
"The mason was so good, we used to 
call him Picasso. Feel that!" he says, 
running his hand over the masonry. 
"He didn't have to make it that smooth. 
He just wanted to!" 


To complete his recollections of the 
construction, Ken takes visitors on the 
famous tour of the wall. As the story 
goes, additional bricks were needed to 
complete the final wall of the building's 
newest room. To solve that dilemma 
Louis' enthusiasts began sending in 
bricks from all over the world. "That 
one's from the Taj Mahal," Ken points 
out. "This one's from William and 
Mary," he says, tapping a somewhat 
charred brick. "The building it was 
taken from burned down. This one's 
from the Coliseum ... " The list goes 
on, illustrating both the diversity of 
Louis' customers and the affection they 
share for the innocuous little lunch-
eonette. 


Louis' regulars have always 
tempered this affection with a wry 
sense of humor. T he Lassens have a 
rapport with their customers that often 
disarms the uninitiated observer ... A 
~ll-dressed middle-aged woman sit-
ting at the counter is about to begin her 
meal. "Could I have some ketchup?" 
she inquires. Pandemonium. To a 
man, the regulars clutch their hearts 
and groan loudly. "What would your 
father say if he were here, Ken?" one 
remarks. Struggling to keep calm, Ken 
tells her she can't have any. The 
woman indignantly insists on ketchup. 
Ken refuses again. The woman per-
sists. Ken grows irate. Finally, after a 
drawn out confrontation, h~i ves in. 
Producing a plastic ketchup bOttle, he 
lowers it toward her hamburger. Sud-
denly, he levels it at her face and 
squeezes. A red stream springs out 
straight for the woman's face. She · 
gasps and cringes, only to see the 
threatening stream 
miraculously 
retract into the bottle from which it 
sprang. "That's ~s close to ketchup as 
you get at Louis' Lunch," Ken says 
triumphantly. 


Underlying Ken's humor, though, 
there is a serious concern for the 
customer's enjoyment. "There's just no 
need for the ketchup," he explains. 
"But it's a kind of ego trip. They don't 
like me telling them what to put on 
their food and I don't like them ruining 
the flavor. If they'd only taste it, they'd 
see." 


Lassen's commitment to quality 
borders on obsession. Every weekday 
he climbs into his huge Chevy:-"a 
tank"-drives to New H aven from his 
home in Orange and puts in a 13-hour 
workday. If a nything, the long hours 
increase his boundless energy. "It's 
taken three generations of hard work to 
produce this lunchroom ," he declares 
with conviction. "and where's the


money from it? It's in your damned 
sandwich!" 


Lassen shows a disregard for money 
that is hard to lind these days. H e gets 
most of his satisfaction from the service 
he renders the community. "Any fool 
can stand there and make hamburgers. 
I like my philosophy of life to come in-
to it." T hat philosophy involves public 
service with a healthy dose of self-
sacrifice. H e cares more about giving 
the community a plac·c that is uniquely 
its own than about turning a profit. 
"People don't have that much money," 
he explains. "We could price our food 
out of your range. My meat bill would 
scare most people. But I don't want to 
do that. I'll never be rich but I'll never 
be poor either." Ken is proud of the 
fact that people come to his restaurant 
and return the next time with their 
friends. 


When a!jkcd to compare his food to 
that of other establishments, Ken 
modestly maintains, "All I know is my 
own stuff." But Lassen does not shrink 
from judging his food on its own 
merits. He knows that he makes a 
quality produc·t. but refuses to compete 
openly with 
neil{hboring establish-
ments. Ken prefers to compare his 
food to more intangible standards. As 
he puts it, "\-Ve take it so seriously 
because we compete with the world." 


Ken Lassen's hands are flying. With 
swift, well-practiced strokes he slices a 
tomato into eight even sections. Grab-
bing an onion, he repeats the process 
and pauses to examine his work. 
Satisfied, Lassen turns with a grin to 
face the counter. 
"What'll it be?" 
"Two cheeseworks and a 
Pepsi, 
Ken." 
Lassen wheels around to face his kit-
chen. He opens the saloon-style oven 
doors to withdraw a batch of ham-
burgers. Before they have a chance to 
cool. he places them on toast. applies 
tomato and onion. adds cheese c.nd 
proceeds to present his customer with 
two of the best hamburl{ers in New 
Haven. And possibly the world .
