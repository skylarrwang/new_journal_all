Soul of the SHining City
Once in the sixth grade in my m idwestern town, we studied 
the nature/nurture debate, whether genetics or the en-
vironment most determine human conduct. One par-
ticularly ingenious pupil suggested there might be other 
factors at work: "Perhaps we have souls." This proposal 
won derisive snorts from some classmates and my teacher. 
She explained gently that the "soul" was a religious concept, 
to be discussed in church school, not science class. 

This story came to mind when President Reagan in-
dicated in Dallas that" he means to make the old issue of 
religion and politics central to his fall campaign. I oppose 
the President's views on that issue. But I have come to 
think that the position implied by the answer my liberal 
and enlightened teacher gave me w~s not adequate, either. 

President R eagan argues that the Constitution rightly 
forbids official establishment of a particular religion. But he 
believes most Americans share a faith iri God,. despite their 
different ways of expressing it. He thinks this common 
faith is needed to sustain traditional values that unite 
Americans and give their lives moral meaning. The Presi-
dent therefore thinks it proper, indeed necessary, for· 
Americans to voice this faith publicly- by permitting 
voluntary prayer in public schools, and by explicitly relying 
on religious values in defining and defending public 
policies on controversial issues such as abortion. 

In response, liberals too often argue that religion should 
be a purely private affair, entirely confined to homes and 
places of worship and entirely excluded from public educa-
tion and political debate. Those answers are too blind to the 
meaning of religious faith and to the cultural needs the 
President addresses. 

Some politicians genuinely believe that God's laws make 
certain policies right. To ask them to ignore those beliefs is 
to demand apostasy; to ask them to conceal them is to re-
quire hypocrisy. Furthermore, students of American socie-
ty from George Washington to Alexis de Tocqueville to 
contemporary sociologist Robert Bellah have agreed that 
this nation needs to be bound together by shared values, 
and that, given our cultural traditions and human 
psychology, most people must understand those values as 
grounded in the eternal will of a Creator. Some scholars 
wonder whether America's vast.._ mobile, diverse society can 
'maintain feelings of loyalty, ovility and community without 
more non-sectarian public reinforcement of the nation's 
spiritual heritage, its "civil religion." 

They h~ve a point. Today we permit in principle, but 
neglect in practice, teaching America's religious and moral 
traditions- and their problems- in our public schools. 
Those studies do not belong in science classes, but they 
have a place. Without them our education implicitly con-
veys the message that the chief alternative moral perspec-
tives are vocational advancement or personal self-
expression. That teaching is both an injustice to our past 
and a loss to our civic culture. I also see nothing wrong 
with polit~ians I!Cting !~cordance with their religious 
consciences; would that more posSt:ssed some such beast. 

But another childhood incident dramatizes for me the 
38 The New Journal/September 7, 1984 
dangers of President Reagan's views. In the second grade 
we began every class with the Pledge of Allegiance, the 
Lord's Prayer and eccentric religious readings by our 
teacher (all supposedly voluntary, though no one told us 
that). This good lady taught that a wise man had predicted 
that Christ would come again, to America, and would 
found a new, perfect city of shining light, probably in 
Chicago. (I recently realized that th,is story was a distorted 
,version of the dream of the late 19th century reformer, 
Henry Demarest Lloyd, who hoped to transform Chicago 
into a model of Christian Socialism.) 

My teacher was addled, but the parents in my Protestant 
school district adored her. There are many similar teachers 
and school districts in America's public school system. That 
is why the President's d!i~ve for so-called "voluntary prayer" 
is disturbing. Today, devout school children can pray 
before school and silently in school during rest periods if 
they so desire. "Voluntary prayer" legislation will mean, in 
practice, vocal prayers during school hours and led by a 
teacher, that will usually reflect the religious opinions of the 
teacher and the area's 
religious 
majority-creating 
psyc~Q!ogi~al pressure on children to conform. (As it is 
these sessions occur in many fundamentalist school districts 
despite the Supreme Court's "no school .prayer" decisions.) 

Some of the dangers attend even the teaching of moral 
and religious traditions as an academic subject. But a 
balanced curriculum would afford less room for sectarian 
proselytizing than public acts of common worship~d I 
think the need to further understanding of our historic 
moral values justifies the risks involved. No such justifica-
tion exists for voluntary prayer. 

Similarly, while politicians certainly can and often 
should explain their religious motivations to voters, they 
are obliged also to give us secular reasons for their policies. 
Public measures that do no more than further the religious 
aims of the ml'!jority have no claim to Jjind citizens of other 
beliefs. They are forms of religious establishment, and they 
should be declared unconstitutional by the courts. It may 
seem undemocratic to insist that the majority offer secular 
as well as religious reasons for its programs. But if our 
public institutions are genuinely to express shared values, 
our laws must be defensible in terms that all citizens can, in 
principle, accept. America's political ideals have been 
thought by many to rest on religion, and if this is not 
understood, these ideals are not understood. But in a socie-
ty containing as many religious and non-religious moral 
perspectives as the United States, only secular arguments 
can serve as common coin. Thus our public schools and 
our legislatures should be forums equally open to discus-
sions of religious and secular beliefs at appropriate times. 
But public institutions must never give primacy to one 
religion over another, or to belief over unbelief, if they are 
to convey political ideals and objectives to which all 
Americans can pledge allegiance.
