Haven. police harass them frequently 
and wtth glee. The kids believe that the 
Yale force 
especially 
resents their 
presence on University grounds. 
"In the winter, they kicked us off the 
grates because of complaints from 
Yalies," Becky says. "But now it's fun 
li>r them. It's their sport." 
"We've been thrown off the streets by 
the Yale cops, we've been sworn at by 
them," says Damon. "One day this sum-
mer when we were sitting on Cross 
Campus, a cop car rolled onto the lawn 
from the Elm Street side. They drove 
past thl' trees, stopped and told us to 
leave. It was purely a scare tactic." 
. Perhaps the most harrowing story the 
ktds have to tell concerns·yet another in-
cident at Yorkside Pizza. As Lynch re-
counts it in an issue of"Not on MTV "' 
Nylon , one of the local cores, was a't-
tacked by a "pack of middle-aged 
machos." T he police, rather than help-

asked the assaulters,"Are you through 
yet?" 
Patrol Commander .Jim O'Neil of the 
New Haven Police, however, has never 
heard of the incident on York Street 
and he does not believe it could have oc~ 
curred without stirring public reaction 
against the officers. "I can't imagine 
J ohn Q. Public standing by without doing 
anything," says O'Neil. "Something like 
that would've come to my attention, 
and I would have done everything I 
wuld h~ve to get the officers' jobs." 
Despite their eagernes<; to gripe about 
the police, the cores have only once 
taken formal action over the harass-
ment. Last spring one of the kids filed 
a complaint against a certain Officer 
G rayling W illiams ("instead of blowing 
up his car, which some people wanted 
to do," says Damon). The kids depict 
Wi.lliams as their own Officer Krupke, 
datming he took pains to make life on 
the Yale campus uncomfortable for 
them. 
Commander George Denison of the 
u.nivcrsity police strongly disagrees 
with 
the 
teenagers' description of 
Williams, stating that the officer never 
abandons professionalism in the course 
of duty. "Officer Williams does not 
harass the kids. He's very consciemious, 
perhaps to the point of being a little
