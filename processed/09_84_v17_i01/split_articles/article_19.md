relocation in Morse. For Scully the 
scale of the monument is better there; 
"it was not quite colossal enough for 
Beinecke," he said. Its artistic value is 
also secure. "Great art makes you 
think. 
It jolts you out of your 
surroundings. People who don't want 
to be jolted don't like Lipstick." 

"When I first heard [it was to be 
reinstalled] I felt relief," Callaway said. 
"I was glad to see it put back in com-
mission. It was done by an eminent 
artist who deserves serious treatment, 
and it is an important little piece of 
Yale lore." 

But for Lipstick the relocation to 
Morse reflects more than a geographic 
change. "The move totally changes and 
loses the original meaning," Thorne 
said in 1974. "It can be revived, but in 
the process is transformed into some-
thing else . . . It's definitely not the 
same monument anymore." 

Lipstic~s revival and survival as a 
new sculpture is part of its artistic 
value. "Its meanings never end," said 
History of Art Professor Susan Cas-
teras. "It's not limited by those it had in 
previous generations." Cas teras notes, 
though, that Lipstick and the attitudes 
about 
it 
point out 
the 
marked 
depoliticization of the campus. "(In 
1969] the Yale student ... revealed 
his vulnerability by openly proclaim-
ing his protests of and challenges to 
prevailing conditions, but now," she 
wrote in 1974, "he generallychooses to 
retreat into the security of academic 
pursuits." The kinds of events that 
have surrounded Lipstick since it was 
placed in Morse are just as revealing, 
she now believes. "It's the site of 
fashion layouts, 
prom antics and 
pranks," she said. "In its own way, it 
now betokens a different attitude 
toward Yale." 

Lipstick has lost its ties to concerns of 
financial aid and housing the poor. "It 
seems to be more like a mascot now," 
Wrede said, "or a Pop joke. T imes 
have changed."
