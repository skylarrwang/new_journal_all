"I see," she says, raising her brows,
"with my eyes." The women bashfully
say the sounds after her. Dorothy
repeats with a "come again" gesture of
her hands, "I" (pointing to herself)

the exercise dissolves into laughter.
Nevertheless the women continue until
they have connected meanings with
sounds.

In the adjoining room, pictures on

Across the front hall in a large, half-
retiled room, several people sit at a
long confen:nce table. Howard Cheng,
ES '87, talks with Lam Tin, a 32-year-
old Chinese-Cambodian immigrant.
"What kinds of things do you like to do
in your free time?" Cheng asks.

Lam grimaces briefly, raises his
brows and breaks into a smile. "I like
the photography, you know, and to
travel and take the picture. I love to
read the book-all book, Chinese and
English. Sometime I like to write, to
translate- especially the Chinese pro-
verb."

Lam has been coming to ACS for
two years. R ecently he has enrolle~
part-time at South Central Commum-
ity College. "Now I take the night
classes. Sometime, in the class I get the
questions, I need someone explain the
word or the idea. The class is big, and I
don't want to stop. It is difficult to
speak so quickly when I get confusion.
Here, I think it is informal, and more
comfortable, not t«?? much pressure. I
can talk with my" tutor about the
homeworks."

Cheng began tutoring as a
] freshman. He came to this country
-" from Hong Kong when he was in
• seventh grade, settling with his family
! in Los Angeles. UCLA ran a program
! similar to ACS. Cheng breaks into a
i
... wide smile when he says, "My tutor
was a great guy. H e was more like a
j big brother. I felt more comfortable
around him than around most other
I Americans my age." Cheng feels ACS
can
be
a
r.ewarding emotional
t'Ommitment. "We can do so much just
to help people feel at home, com-
fortable -
to be a friend. just to
talk and listen."

Down the front hall the kitchen
shared by both MEChA and AASA
students is used for tutoring as well.
