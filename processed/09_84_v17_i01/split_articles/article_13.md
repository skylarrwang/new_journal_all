Maybe I think too much for my own good,
&me people say so, other people say no, no
The fact is you don't think as much as you
could.
-Paul Simon
I thjnk too much. Most Yalies do. Is
there any doubt that our university is
overzealously cerebral when the
geographic,
intellectual and social
center of campus is a cathedral of
knowledge whose altar is labeled "Cir-
culation"?
People expect us to be brilliant.
When strangers learn that I go to Yale,
they inevitably ask my SA Ts or beg,
"Say something smart." Some people,
however, see through our facade. I had
a Southern friend whose unc.le took him
around Alabama saying, "This here's
my nephew. He's going to Yay-ell. Up
there, they teach you to say 'inn-cret-
tible.' Instead of just 'bool-shee-it."' He
was impressed nonetheless.
To justify the world's belief in our in-
telligence, we overindulge in thought.
It becomes an act of self-preservation.
Everyone else is doing it, so hadn't we
better keep up? We rabidly think but
forget how to conclude. As good liberal
arts students, so well-fitted for careers
a..s defense lawyers, we can conscien-
tiously and competently argue both
sides of every question, but think too
much to be able to choose an opinion of
our own.

Thinking too much is a process of
continual and deepening rationaliza-
tion, analysis and questioning. "Should
I really have blown off the whole after-
noon talking to my roommates? I need-
ed a break from studying. I'll be more
efficient tonight now,
I
promise.
Besides, I can learn from them. But are
those the real reasons?· Are they valid?
Maybe I really did it
because I'm
young and felt like it. Maybe I should


resolve to avoid the room whenever
people are there. Should I reo.lry avoid
the room?" The circle goes unproduc-
tively on and on.

Guilt prevails. I feel terrible about
those ten other poor devils who could be
enrolled here instead of me. One of
them probably could have arbitrated a
successful union settlement by now,
another could have engineered a way to
keep the sense in Centrex. My over-
thinking breeds insecurity- will the sky
sp~ak to me outside Yale Station one
day, saying "You're a computer error.
Please vacate your room in 24- hours" ?(I
had a friend who used to call random
freshmen up and give that exact
message, reducing some of them to
tears. He didn't think enough.)

Our insecurity causes a repression of
spontaneity and enthusiasm. Yalies all
know what an intellectual, sophisticated
group we're supposed to be. No over-
thinker wants to say or do anything that
makes him look naive: "Have a rela-
tionship with you? Let's first discuss the
feasibility of that in light of our respec-
tive expectations," or "Sign a petition?
Come on, all that political rhetoric
doe.m't really mean anything."

Yale teaches us the safety of Nega-
tion. We learn how to refute, forgetting
that it takes more courage to substan-
tiate and sustain a belief over time. The
study of the history of thought, so
popular with the seriously cerebral, in-
stills this habit in us. We understand
and agree with Plato, then Aristotle
refutes him. Hume makes sense, then
Kant, our new favorite, obliterates his
arguments. We follow these models and
never agree with anyone. When yo,u
think about it, how many times have
you heard a Yalie say "That's a good
point" without adding, "hut"?

In our schoolwork we edit ourselves
~ as closely as possible to give ourselves
... the best chance of earning approval.
~ We censor our own thoughts and
i speech to avoid
being considered
~ callow. We also af:Jologize for ourselves
and our work apead of time in order to
outshine others in criticizing ourselves
incisively. We preface papers with notes
to TAs-"This isn't exactly what I
wanted to say, but I trietf'-and self-
deprecate to our friends- "You may
think I'm self-centered and silly to ask,
but do you like my hair?" We conscien-
tiously deflate possible critics by beating
them to the punches aimed at us.

The overthinker works overtime the
night before a paper's due. After over-
thinking a topic, a conclusion and an
outline (the process can take up to four
weeks for the pathologically cerebral) he
begins to overthink each sentence.
"That sounds terrible!" he says, resting
his forehead on the typewriter in
despair. "I'm not doing my best. I'm an
underachiever, I don't deserve oxygen.
I should be expressing what I have to
say better; I'm not living up to my
potential. Everyone else_ can obviously


excel here, but I'm not doing my best.
I'm an underachiever;" Total paralysis
sets in. after two complete cycles of
thought. ·

Things don't improve for the over-
thinker even after the paper is returned
and graded. A spiral· of pessimism traps-
him as if he were a tissue in the flushing
toilet of academic neurosis. "I got a B on
my last paper after working extra hard.
I'll have to spend more time next time.
But if that's the best I can do, why
bother?" Self-conscious A students can
-
carry this further : "I did well only
because I _ b.s.'d well," one Phi Beta
Kappa thinks. "I wasn't stunning, and I
didn't really learn anything or say
anything, did I?"

No one's ever satisfied. That's one of
the main tenets of human existence. If
we were, the whole universe could grind
to a standstill. Especially here, where
our dissatisfaction with our own ig-
norance employs a large percentage of
the city. But since we're used to being
satisfied with our places on the top of
the pile in high school, we refuse to be
satisfied with less than the best. In this
pool of big fish, we no longer compete
against our classmates
but against
ourselves,
our
perfect
ideals of
ourselves. One overthinker in a class of
mine freshman year, for example,
dropped a class at tnidterm, unhappy
wltf1 his A- average. By senior year, the
blatant cerebralite either has a job lined
up at Morgan Stanley, a full scholarship
to law school, or the conviction that he
is a total failure. Only best and most is
good enough.

There is a limi~ to this, though. Exain
time arrives and people answer my
cheerful "How are you"s _with ''Three
20-page papers, four finals and a
lab due." Dinner time conversation
~omes one long bout ·of one-upman-
ship, each of us trying our hardest tp
•
appear The Most Overworked. It can't
be done . . Who really wants the title
anyway, when the only . way to secure
the crown is to end up on your back in
DUH with a bad case of the nerves?

That's usually good for a dean's excuse
anyway, which erases the pressure, and
with it all that glory and attention.

When the going gets tough here,
prioritize. You need fewer hours of
sleep
and definitely fewer hours of
thinking. Subsistence is key: "I think_
therefore I am" becomes "I think as little
as possible just to keep myself going."

It's too scary to get in the bind of
overthinking and overrationalizing
every move. Paralysis results: "What
should I have for dinner?" I ask myself.
"The meat with brown sauce probably
has fewer calories and more vitamins
and iron. The sauce, however, may be
last week's butterscotch pudding in
disguise. There's always Swiss Cheese
Souffle, but I was warned against three-
word dishes, especially if one of the
words
is Cheese- Cheese-Rice
Casserole, Cheddar Cheese Fondue,
etc." Meanwhile
the college starves
l;>ehind me in line, and I settle for salad.

Soon we begin to avoid thought
altogether. Look what it does to us-we
lose sleep, we lose friends, we lose
perspective when we spend too much
energy on our work, which after all is
seen by no one save a professor or two.
We don't want to know that we're blow-
ing off an intimate after-dinner conver-
sation in favor of a study session which
could conceivably make the difference
between an A and an A-. We have -
every reason !O put our minds in
neutral. Or so we think.


Despite our fear and subsequent re-
jection of thought, we still have to fu,nc-
tion in class, so we rely on bluffi-ng pur
way through, · the most valuable skill
this place teaches us. Unfortunately
those who fear and avoid thinking too
much tend to be loud and obnoxious.
Most of their insecurities have been
consolidated into their fear of thinking
and thus, rather than censor their com-·
ments for public approval, they blurt
out whatever comes into their heads.
"We'll come back to this," says the
underthinker in the grating and in-
gratiating voice of a
television
newscaster, "but what I want to discuss
now is how I think Nietzsche is very
edifying on this topic ... " _

Those who avoid thought face trou-
ble when it comes to real life issues. The
.
incoming senior, sick of six semesters of
overthinking, asks himself, "What am I
going to be when I grow up in nine
months?" and decides it is easier to
follow the crowd to the rat race's star-
ting line than to ans~er that question in
the privacy of his own head.

We're spinning our wheels here in an
academic grist of papers and unan-
chored ideas. Our thoughts are trained
to circle and go deeper. We leave this
pJace with lots of ptactice in thinking,
but that's all it is
practice. What's
next? Answering this question requires
forward motion powered by another
species of thinking.

Should we worry that the pattern of
·
· g leading to fear of thinking
leading to avoidance of
goes
even further? Does fear of
g too
little out of fear of thinking too much
cause even deeper overthinking? I think
too much.
