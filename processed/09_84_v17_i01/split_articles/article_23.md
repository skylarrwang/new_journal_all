Ken La .. c n awaits the afternoon rush 

The door swings open as a middle-
aged runner enters the lunchroom. He 
sizes up the customers before address-
ing himself to Lee Lassen, the woman 
behind the counter. Grinning im-
petuously, he asks her the location of 
the nearest McDonald's. With a tight-
lippe4 smile she calmly points him 
toward the worst part of town. "Go 
on," she says, "keep running." "Wait a 
minute," the runner asks, "you 
wouldn't make hamburgers 
here, 
would you?'" Lee can no longer sup路 
press her smile and proceeds to ask the 
.vi tty regular customer how he's been. 
Lee Lassen and her husband Ken do 
not simply run a luncheonette. They 
are the proprietors of a certified New 
Haven institution called Louis' Lunch, 
the birthplace of the hamburger. At 
first glance the simple brick building 
resembles an ordinary home. Few 
signs of activity can be seen within. 
~ut at 11:30 a.m. the beginnmg of the 
lunchtime rush changes the situation 
dramatically. 
Louis' regulars start 
pouring into the tiny building for a 
hurried lunch and a few minutes of 
conversation. 
They crowd into a room containing 
one large picnic table, five smaller 
tables and a counter. Behind the 
counter two large black ovens produce 
a steady barrage of sizzling ham-
burgers and cheeseburgers. 
Im-
mediately next to the ovens, racks of 
onions and tomatOes await the finished 
product. A checkered tablecloth and a 
neatly arranged pile of napkins give 
the picnic table the feeling of a family kit路 
chen. Strangers sit together at this 
large table as if they were friends. The 
line comes out of the door of the tiny 
building as businessmen, laborers and 
students wait for their burgers. Just 
above the counter at the front of the 
line, a sign proudly proclaims, "These 
are the good old days." 
The 
Lassen's 
establishment has 
never lost sight of its good old days. 
Ken's grandfather. Louis 
Lassen, 
started the business in 1895. Back then 
the specialty of the house was a steak 
sandwich- also invented at Lou is', 
Ken claims. The elder Lassen would 
bring home the raw trimmings from 
his steak creation and use them to 
make his children's dinner. Only in路 
stead of preparing steak sandwiches, 
he put the trimmings through a hand 
grinder and cooked up the ground 
meat. The little Lassens enjoyed these 
meals so much that Louis began to 
consider adding the dish to his menu. 
Then one day in 1900, as legend has it, 
one 路of the regulars asked for a quick 
lunch to go. Lassen cooked up some of 
the ground meat, put it between twO 
pieces of toast, and the hamburger was 
bam... 
Louis' son Ervin and grandson Ken 
soon joined in the family business.
