However, the group realized the 
dangers of organizing a crowd. "It 
wasn't a time to mess around lightly

Yale was very gun shy; we respected 
that. We wanted to creal<' a situation 
that would be disarming for the ad· 
ministration and the spectators, so 
they wouldn't know what to do but 
they'd have a good time." 


Scully told h is classes, "Noon Thurs· 
day. Reinecke Plaza. Something will 
happen." Suspicious posters appeared 
and word spread through the colleges. 
Scully knew the administration was

parody the lwo Jima war monument. 
"Wait till you see the top." Scully said. 
"It's full of force. It's really like a rocket 
to M ars. It's kinda great." 


The red inflatable tip was attached 
to the tube and O ldenburg connected 
the air tank. "It may lean slightly," he 
had warned, "but that's true also of the 
Tower of Pisa." The tip was inflated 
and the Colossal Keepsake Corpora·
