When Daniel James '33 testified before the House Un-Amcrican Ac-tivities Committee in the summer of 1951, he brought a copy of Voltaire's Candidt. The book had been published under a pen name and .James believt·d that if the Committee continued 34 Th~ l':~w .Journal/~pl~mber 7, 1984 blacklisting artists allt•gedly affiliated with the Communist Party. Amt•ri<·an writers would resort to po;~udonyms in order to publi<;h. The Committee was not interested in James' anecdote and stopped him l)('fon· ht• could lini,h. 

Thirty-two years later Simon and Schuster published Famous All Otm 7iJwn, a novel about a 14-vear-old Chit·ano growing up in the b~rrios of East Los Angeles. Heralded as "a book about Mexican-American culture from the inside but for outsiders." it won the 198:~ American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Rosenthal Founda-tion Award as a work of literary merit ~ whi< h had not suct·eedcd commercial-ly. 'The author was Danny Santiago, ~ who according 10 the book jacket ~ "grew up in Los Angeles and is tht• ~ author of stories published in Playbo)!, i Rtdhnok, and Nutrlrn." His editors also ~ considered nominating the novel, San-8 tiago's first, for the Pulitzer Prize, but ht· refused to supply the requisite bio~raphical sket<·h. For 16 years he had remained an enigma to his readers, his agent and even Rob Render, his editor at Simon and Schuster. Santiago communidrl(d on-ly through letters from a post office box in Pacific Grove. California. "We fi~-,rured he was probably in prison and didn't want anybody 10 know," Render said in a Nau York TimtS interview. 

Danny Santiago is not in prison. 1 hough he had been before. Danny San·tiago did not grow.J.lp in Los Angeks; he is a product of it. Danny Santiago is Dan .James. whose 1951 prediction has come true, at least for him. James hid behind a pseudonym partly becaust• ht· had been blacklisted, partly becaust• he felt he could not writt' without it.

ing labor. "I got 75 cents an hour. The management cheated us," James re-called. While writing in Kansas City he was sent to prison several times on "ridiculous charges- for endorsing unemployment insurance and passing out leaflets," he said. His father en-couraged him to write. "That was mostly to keep me out of jail," .James said. He moved to California in 1937 and joined the Communist Party a year later, while working as an assis-tant director with Charlie Chaplin on The Great DictalQr. 

Four years later James' own play, Winter Soldiers, a paean to the Soviet Union, earned him the Howard Memorial Award for "the young American playwright showing the most promise." 

That promise was not fulfilled. James' writing career declined follow-ing his blacklisting three years after he left the Party in 1948. That same year, at the request of a friend, he and his wife Lilith started volunteering in the Los Angeles barrios. After 20 years of social work there, James had collected enough material for his book, which took 15 years to write. 

Famous All Over Town tells the story of Chato Medina, "partially me in a Mexican suit," James said. It brings together many threads from the author's early career. His social con-cern had surfaced during his Yale years in activities such as a hunger march on Hartford. He learned fur-ther lessons of empathy from Chaplin. "He taught me the closeness of tragedy and absurd farce." As for James' in-terest in Communism he said, "A cer-tain social guilt affected it. Com-munism was standing for some very progressive things back then- un-employment insurance, black rights, women's rights." Famous All Over Town speaks eloquently and · subtly for the Hispanic community where he had spent half a lifetime, 

"Just write your name and keep them guessing," Chato says to himself at the end of his story when he signs all of the buildings near his recently-leveled neighborhood . .James too has incurred some resentment with his signature. "We were taken," said Philip Her-rera, founder of Nuestro, (Spanish for "our"), which printed some of Danny Santiago's stories. "We were trying to present the best image of Hispanics we could. We were not trying to publish Anglo writers with Spanish surnames." 

Some critics suggested that James' ethnic surname was a determining fac-tor in his receiving the Rosenthal Award, but R.W.B. Lewis, professor of English and American Studies, denies this. Lewis, the member of the selection committee who introduced the book to the group, and another member agreed that "the ethnicity of the author had nothing to do with giv-Famous All Doer Town is the story of Chato Medina's turf in a Los Angeles barrio and its importance to him as he grows up. The Medinas join a fruitless fight against the Southern Pacific Railroad, the employer of most of the area's residents, which had decided to tear down the area to build a freight yard. Chato, the novefs cynical and savvy narrator, gives an outsider's view of the in-side of City Hall: 
.. City Planning Commission," a block of wood said in gold. 
There were nine planners pres-ent. each one with his private sign, such as La Kretz, Torvaldsen, Kleinburger and other all-American names. You don't see much GOmez up there at City Hall, or Garcia. at least not without a broom in hand. The Planners sat listening in fat green chairs and passed the time by put-ting their glasses on and taking them off. Of all those 18 hands there was not a sangle missing finger which would be a world record for any 9 of our people. A tall, gray-haired, S-shape man was preaching from the pulpit in front. Mr. Cockburn they called him, which seemed a very crazy name to me, even for an Amerrcan. 
"What's he talking?" "JY father asked. 
"All about a bunch of slums someplace," I answered. "They didn't get to Shamrock yet." 
But I was wrong. Mr. Cock-bum snapped his fingers and they splashed a very familiar picture on a big movie screen. My father gasped like shot. It was our home, and how mean and ugly 'fe looked up there between those marble col-umns ... 
Was I deprived and disadvan-taged like this man t·d, or destituted? My father worked steady. I had never been rry for myself before, except maybe two Christmases back. And here I was living in The Slums and never knew it. because by the time Mr. Cockburn added it all up, even a q.caracba would be ashamed to admit Shamndt Street was his home address.

ing him the prize. It was for the book's literary worth. He received no special consideration as a Chicano." Yet in a New York Times interview Lewis said, "I would have to say that if we had known [about the pseudonym, the book] it wo"uld have given us pause. We would not necessarily have rejected it, but we would have had to talk a little more about it. It does raise all kinds of interesting questions. 

"After we found out about the pen name," he concluded in a recent inter-view, "we agreed the book was a greater achievement than we had realized. It wasn't an autobiography like rd assumed, but it's a work of imagining. Tha~ makes it better." 

James, who plans to continue writing as Danny Santia.go, had few qualms about the pseudonym. "I said. 'Nobody's going to be hurt if the book's any good.'" Though some critics have suggested that the H ispanic pseudo-nym allowed him to profit from the re-cent popularity of minority writers • .James denies this. "Sixteen publishers turned the book down. and I tried to pla<:·e it for five years. Having a Hispanic name didn't help." 

Rohnto Gonza]ez-Echevarria.chairman ol Yale's Spanish department. justHies the use of a pen name. "We are always deceived by literature." hl· said. "It's alway!l playing games with us. so why should we be deceived by this? The book adds to the value of Chicano issues as a valid literary thcmt• not restricted to writers of Chicano origin." 

Bender also denied the importance of the pen name. "Until an author is very well-known it doesn't make any difference who he is or where he is from. When you're buying a book from an unknown author, you ~ave to rely on the book for publicity, not the author. All that matters is the novel, the work of the imagination. It wasn't offered as a biography. He spent more than 20 years in the neighborhood and was as well-qualified to write about it as anyone." 

Why then did j ames feel he needed a pen name? "In som~·ways, Danny San-tiago is what I wanted to be but am not," he explained about what he refers to as his "mild deception." "He's brash, impetuous, macho. I was writing dur-ing years when the threat of the blacklist was still very strong. I lost confidence in myself, in my ability to write. Danny Santiago had that con-fidence." 

An·ording to graduaH· student Tom Ferraro, who will indudt• lht· final chapter of Famou.r All Ov" Town in his American Studies senior seminar. ~James' emulation of a gheuo voice renects his inability to find his own voice, partly because of the hurl and disillusionment he had with Com-munism. He had experiem·es to look back upon, so he had a psy<:holol{ical need to look at himself a<; Danny San-tiago."
