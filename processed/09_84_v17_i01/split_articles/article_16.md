Think about lipstick. 
It comes in 
many colors. You can buy it, use it, 
throw it away. Now imagine a three-
and-a-half ton, 22-foot tall fiberglass 
and aluminum lipstick perched on steel 
tank treads. 
Put it in the middle of 
Yale University. 
What can you do 
with it? Suddenly you can't use it and 
you certainly can't throw it away. 
What does it mean? 
The giant lipstick resting peacefuily 
in Morse College indicates little of the 
tumult that accompanied its creation 
15 years ago. No longer standing in 
defiance, it has become Morse's totem, 
and much of the history and meaning 
behind it has been forgotten by the 
students who gather for intramural 
games or sunbathe near it. 


It was the year before coeducation 
began, the year before the May Day 
riots. T he Vietnam War had brought 
political activism to college campuses. 
At Yale the School of Architecture was 
a center of unrest. There was pressure 
for a broader curriculum and a de-
mand for architects to become more in-
volved in the lives of cities and the 
hardships of people pushed out of their 
homes by urban expansion. 


Another issue within the school was 
financial aid. 
"There were many 
students actually living below the 
poverty level at the time," said Sam 
Callaway, '64, M. Arch. '69, "and no 
financial aid was being made available 
to them. Many of us felt the professors 
should be behind the movement to 
help the students, and when they 
weren't they lost a lot ot respect." 


Arch itecture students had already 
displayed their discontent by burying 
an effigy in the· Noguchi sculpture well 
of Beinecke Library. 
Some people 
suspect them of setting the J une 1969 
fire 
in the Art and 
Architecture 
Building which caused $700,000 in 
damages. 


The mood of the times was radical 
and the art was Pop. A leading con-
temporary artist was sculptor Claes 
Oldenburg '50 already well-known in 
1968. H e had broken ground with the 
Ray G un Machinery Co., a "store" 
that operated for two months and sold 
replicas of food and ord inary objects 
made out of cloth, plaster and chicken 
wire. He had also gained prominence 
for his soft sculpture, large objects 
made of canvas and stuffed with foam, 
such as a 10-foot long ice-cream cone, a 
giant typewriter and a full-scale car. 


O ldenburg's latest interest was in 
"colossal monuments." His drawings 
for such works included a giant teddy 
bear for Central Park, a toilet-tank 
float for London's Thames River and a 
huke Good Humor Bar for Park 
Avenue. None of these sculptures had 
been built, and Oldenburg considered 
most of them unfeasible. 


Stuart Wrede '65, M. Arch. '70, 
developed more than a passing interest 
in Oldenburg's colossal monuments 
when he interviewed Herbert Mar-
cuse, a prominent spokesman for the 
New Left, in j une 1968. "Ifyou could 
really envisage a situation where ... 
there would be ... in the middle of 
Times Square a huge banana I would 
say- and I think safely say- this socie-
ry has come to an end," Marcuse said. 
"I think it would be one of the most 
bloodless means to achieve a radical 
change ... just imagine that over-
night it would suddenly be there." 


Wrede shared the idea of realizing 
an Oldenburg m!imument with some of 
his fellow students~ Not all appreciated

structure at cost. One of the legendary 
colossal monuments was now feasible. 


Oldenburg came to New Haven a 
number of times to select a site and 
subject; various ideas were considered, 
including dropping small monuments 
from the air onto Cross Campus and 
creating a giant {Toothpastej Tube Being 
Stepped On. He explained one inspira-
tion for the lipstick sculpture at the 
time: "I found a long orange balloon 
fluttering from the antenna of a parked 
car as I stood contemplating [Beinecke 
Plaza). The balloon seemed huge, 
bouncing against the paternal cla<>sical 
and Egyptian edifices. Just what the 
place needs, I thought." Lipstick -...as 
already a somewhat prominent motif 
in his work; a 1966 drawing replaced 
the Fountain of Eros in London's Ptc-
cadilly Circus with a collection of 
lipstick tubes. 


CKCC chose the lipstick over the 
{Toothpastej Tube in early spring 1969 
and Oldenburg began construction. 
He worked out of a studio on State 
Street and his deadline was May 15, 
Ascension Day. The lipstick tip would 
be inflatable by an air pump in the 
base, and the common man could par-
ticipate in the sculpture by pumping it 
up. Oldenburg suggested an inflated 
lipstick could be a.~ignal that a speech 
or gathering was to be held underneath 
it. 


By May 13 the Corporation had run 
out of money and the lipstick was un-
finished. 
Cheaper materials 
were 
substituted, and the 
students 
themselves completed the remaining 
parts on time. But even before the 
lipstick was ready, installing it posed a 
problt"m. University officials, along 
with nearly the entire campus, knew 
nothing of the monument. Should it be 
brought in by helicopter? In the middle 
of the night? Eventually CKCC deci-
ded to make the installation a Happen-
ing, an event which could become a 
work of art in itself. .. As Lippincott 
gavt" the monument three-dimensional 
form," Callaway explained, "we real-
ized it was a symbol that would have 
meaning outside the art and architec-
ture schools. We wanted to find a way 
for people to rally around it."
