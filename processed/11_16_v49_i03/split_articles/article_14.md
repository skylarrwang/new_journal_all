WHY BUY A COW
P R O F I L E
In the Arethusa universe, Manolo Blahnik executives sell high-quality 
yogurt and a pastoral lifestyle

I’m eyeing a ten-dollar bottle of eggnog, thinking 
will I, but half-heartedly at best, because I will, and I do, 
and that’s the story of how I end up spending thirty real 
American dollars on eggnog. The eggnog, advertised as 
“old-world” and “small-batch,” comes in oblong, glass 
bottles. They’re recyclable. The eggnog’s only available 
in November and December, if it’s not already sold out. 
The purveyor, Arethusa Farm Dairy, believes that you 
don’t just let eggnog sit on shelves, in cartons. To relegate 
Arethusa Dairy products to the back of some supermarket 
refrigerator is to desecrate not only the food but also the 
philosophy undergirding it, the gastronomic values that 
might justify your shelling out thirty bucks at the year-old 
Chapel Street Arethusa Farm Dairy retail outlet. Dairy 
can be an art in the way Dutch Golden Age portraiture is, 
in the way haute couture is, and if there are any two men 
who aspire to the art of dairy, they are George Malkemus 
and Anthony Yurgaitis.
