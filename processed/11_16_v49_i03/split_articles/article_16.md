ID cards have given us access to Yale since the ‘90s. What do they signify?

When Miko McGinty was a senior at Yale in 1993, she 
could get in anywhere. Most students on campus lugged 
around three keys at all times (one for their college’s 
courtyard, one for their entryway, and one for their suite), 
and still had to wait outside the gates of other residential 
colleges until a sympathetic student let them in. McGinty 
made no such sacrifices: as the owner of a master key 
passed down from an upperclassman friend, she was 
one of only about ten students she knew who could get 
through every college gate on campus.

Yale’s administration wasn’t particularly excited 
about the idea of students having unrestricted access to 
buildings, so some time during McGinty’s junior year, 
she says, the University changed locks on campus to 
render the master keys ineffective. Within a few hours, 
though, a student had figured out how to alter the old 
key to fit the new lock. The secret to retaining access 
quickly spread by word-of-mouth. Soon, McGinty says, 
she heard from a friend: “Oh yeah, you take your gate 
key and line it up with your master key—the fourth 
knob on the master key is gonna be wrong, and if you 
file it down it’ll work.”

Although it still exists somewhere (she passed it 
down to a Jonathan Edwards freshman when she grad­
uated), McGinty’s master key is now useless. In 1994, 
Yale began transitioning to the current swipe card sys­
tem for building entry. The mid-nineteen-nineties were 
a tense time for Yale–New Haven relations, particularly 
following the high-profile murder of Christian Prince, 
a student who was shot and killed on Hillhouse Avenue 
one February night in 1991. Across campus, security 
amped up. ID cards, scanned by electronic readers 
stationed at building entrances, were implemented 
as a safer, streamlined, and thoroughly modern alter­
native to keys. Each one only cost $7 to manufacture, 
and electronic card readers cost a few thousand dol­
lars apiece, according to a 1998 Yale Herald article in 
praise of the new “3.3”x2.1”x0.02”” powerhouse.” IDs 
were less to carry, easy to deactivate if lost, fumble-free 
for the student coming off the street late at night. And 
most importantly, perhaps, they were almost impossi­
ble to alter.

As more buildings installed readers over the years, 
the potential access capabilities of the card expanded. 
In 2016, a Yale ID has the technological power to get 
you into most buildings on campus, pay for your food 
and books, and help buy you a drink (if you’re of age). 
More than any navy sweatshirt, an ID is the physical 
manifestation of belonging at Yale. And it now serves 
a tripartite purpose: It marks its holder as a member 
of this community, gives her the ability to physically 
participate in it, and, theoretically, keeps her safe from 
outside threats. But more than twenty years into the 
practice, we take our cards for granted. We forget that 
they symbolize more than the ability to open a gate, 
and we forget what we agree to by carrying a dinky 
piece of plastic in our back pockets.   


Officially, the communities you’re a part of at Yale 
determine your access to the buildings on campus. 
The ID Card Center, a four-person office that oper­
ates under the College’s Security Systems, organizes 
university personnel into groups who either receive or 
are denied access to a particular door and links that 
information to each individual’s card. When you hold 
your ID near the reader of any given building on cam­
pus, the chip inside the card sends out a number that 
identifies you. The reader runs that number through a 
program that checks which groups you fall under, then 
sends a decision via LED light, red or green.

Some buildings, like libraries or academic buildings, 
are open to anyone with a Yale ID, which includes 
undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and 
staff. With the exception of fellows in a particular 
college, professors can only get into the buildings 
that house their offices and classrooms, and college 
staff such as dining hall or facilities workers only have 
access to buildings in the colleges where they work. 
The courtyards of residential colleges are accessible 
to all undergraduate students, but entryways are only 
open for students of that college. In an email, George 
Hines, Director of Security Systems for the University, 
explained that the ID center’s workers can also set time 
boundaries on access for a particular entrance or per­
son. Such requests are handled on an individual basis.

Stuart Teal has served as Program Manager of Yale’s 
Information Technology Services since graduating 
from Yale in 2014. Under the ID system, he explained, 
people should only be able to get into places they need 
to be for University business—but there are loopholes. 
Adam Sokol, a senior in Saybrook College, received 
access to all entryways on campus when he worked for 
the Office of Sustainability on Spring Salvage in 2015. 
That was intentional: His job consisted of going into all 
residential colleges to pick up books and furniture that 
students left behind and compiling it to be reclaimed 
by new owners. But even after the Salvage, as spring 
turned into summer and most students left campus, 
Sokol found he still had access to entryways across 
campus. And the access stuck around more than a year. 
It was only this fall that he found he can no longer get 
into some entryways on campus (though he still has 
access to more than he technically should).

“It wasn’t like I had access to the room where Yale 
keeps its millions of dollars,” he said. “It was just the 
entryways. It’s just a little convenient.”

Technology glitches are to be expected. But such 
seemingly random extensions of access also make sense 
in a more abstract way: Being a student at Yale both 
literally and metaphorically opens doors. Inside the 
college gates, which particular ones you can open can 
feel both arbitrary and unimportant. Once you’re in, 
you’re in.

In this way, a Yale ID is no different from a key—
either you have one or you don’t. But as a form of iden­
tification, the swipe card adds a new dimension. You 
have access because of who you are. And that’s a politi­
cal assertion, especially at a university with a $25.5 bil­
lion endowment in a city where, as of 2015, more than 
one in every four residents lives below the poverty line.

Some campus spaces—open areas like Cross Cam­
pus, select libraries during certain hours, the Yale 
University Art Gallery—are available to the public, 
but, without an ID, New Haven residents are other­
wise excluded from campus. Partly, this is simply a 
pragmatic consideration: Yale is a private institution 
embedded in a city. But Architecture professor Elihu 
Rubin, who specializes in the social life of urban space, 
argues that swipe cards can also symbolically reinforce 
of the barriers between New Haven and Yale. 
“Both Yale students and Yale faculty are people with 
a lot of mobility and access in the world at large. And 
the distribution of key card privileges reinforces that 
system of access. But there are a lot of people in New 
Haven who have a lot less mobility and access, both 
physical and social,” he said. 

Alicia Schmidt Camacho, a professor of Ethnicity, 
Race, and Migration and American Studies, works 
with the New Haven organization Junta for Progres­
sive Action. She said she understands the need for 
security, and thinks access to physical campus space 
is less important than other areas in which Yale could 
improve its relationship to the city, such as its hiring 
practices and downtown development strategy. 
But, she said, part of being a community means you 
can trust that people are looking out for you. The IDs 
are symbolic of that dynamic—they mark Yale students 
as the University’s top concern and all others as poten­
tial threats. In asserting its responsibility to protect Yale 
students, however, the University also gains the power 
to keep track of them. 


In September 2009, 24-year-old medical student 
Annie Le went missing days before she was supposed 
to be married. In the attempts to find her, Yale Police 
looked to the locational data provided by her ID. The 
last campus building she’d entered was 10 Amistad St., 
where she worked in a lab. They then checked security 
footage from that building, which showed her entering 
at 10 a.m. and never leaving. After a thorough search, 
police found Le’s body hidden inside a wall. Swipe 
card information was also crucial to identifying the 
murderer. Only certain IDs were able to access the lab, 
and looking at the database to figure out who had that 
permission eventually led police to their suspect. Lab 
technician Raymond Clark III pled guilty to strangling 
Le and was sentenced to forty-four years in prison.

Locational data doesn’t usually yield such useful 
or sinister information. In fact, most of the time, it’s 
not used at all. George Hines assured me over email 
that students are not being “tracked.” Swipe cards fall 
under the University’s acceptable use policy for tech­
nology, which states that University officials can access 
information about University personnel without their 
permission only when identifying or fixing system prob­
lems, when investigating a potential violation of the 
law, or to carry out essential University business func­
tions. But the more specific information about who 
gets that access, what scenarios fit those criteria, and 
how those data could be used to benefit the University, 
is less publicized. 

After emailing Hines multiple times without 
response last month, I went to the Yale Security Depart­
ment’s office, tucked away in a corner next to the park­
ing garage by Yale Health. The door was locked and I 
had to tap on the window to get the attention of one of 
the men sitting by a series of computer monitors pro­
jecting footage from around campus. After a moment, 
somebody let me in and led me down a long hallway 
to Hines’ office. He was friendly and apologized for not 
answering my emails, but he was clear—at security,
