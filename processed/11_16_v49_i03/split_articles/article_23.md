2. Civics class
High School in the Community 
Thursday morning
The students in Justin Scully’s third-period 
civics class at High School in the Commu­
nity, a New Haven public school on Union 
Street, laugh more on November 10 than 
they did on November 9. The day after 
Donald Trump’s election, both Carolyn 
Martinez and Vartaysha Reed cried during 
class. Today, though, the juniors have a 
test on the foundations of the US govern­
ment—the Virginia Plan, the Articles of 
Confederation, a bonus question of who’s 
on the ten dollar bill—and the tears are 
gone. Morning light floods through the 
windows onto the linoleum floor. Before 
Scully passes out the test, I ask the class a 
few questions about how they’re feeling.
Tyron Huston sits in the center row of the 
desks and remembers the previous day. 
“Justin was really depressed,” he says, 
smirking. Scully nods. Martinez jumps 
in to say that she is terrified, and others 
assent. The students—none of whom 
are old enough to vote—used to joke 
about Trump’s campaign, but the humor 
is different now. It’s more exhausted; a 
placeholder for resignation.
Scully cuts through the chatter to point out 
Laurel Cubellotti, the class’s only Trump 
supporter. She reluctantly reports that 
she’s happy with the results, tacking on a 
bashful “sorry” and a shrug. She doesn’t 
seem victorious. “I’m actually really 
shocked,” she says. “When he won, I 
didn’t know what to do.” Scully adds that 
Trump’s New York hotel, which he has vis-
ited, is, in fact, nice. (Reed retorts that her 
grandmother has been there, too, “and 
she says it’s trash.”)
The students move on, discussing a 
recount, whether Bernie Sanders might 
have defeated Trump, and the rumor that 
fourteen thousand Americans voted for 
the slain gorilla Harambe. When Scully 
passes out the tests, things quiet down. 
Now, they have to remember how many 
states had to ratify the Bill of Rights.  
When backpacks start zipping closed an 
hour later, Scully reminds them about  
their upcoming essay on John Locke.  
The bell rings.

3. “United Against Hatred”
New Haven Green
Thursday night
Three hundred protesters surged out 
of the plaza in front of the Connecti­
cut Financial Center and onto Church 
Street on the Thursday evening after the 
election. Unidad Latina en Acción, a New 
Haven-based immigrant rights advocacy 
group, had planned the demonstration at 
a meeting the night before. Organizer Dan 
Ravizza brought a bass drum, emblazoned 
with a Jolly Roger, from the Local No. 24 
Carpenters Union. He fired up the crowd 
with a pulsating beat.
University of Connecticut student and 
ULA member Jesus Morales-Sanchez 
spoke first. “Trump has given his implicit 
permission to hate,” he said. “Now we 
know for sure the fight must continue.”

Susan Bramhall, a member of Jewish 
Voice for Peace who has participated in 
protests in New Haven since 1969, said 
the protest was the largest she’d seen 
since the Iraq War. 
At the behest of John Lugo, the co- 
founder of ULA, the crowd chanted a 
call-and-response: 
“Whose streets?” 
“Our streets!”
The protestors marched around the 
Green. As the crowd circled Rite Aid, it 
fell into rhyme: “Hey hey! Ho ho! Don-
ald Trump has got to go!” Shop owners 
peered out of their storefronts as they 
passed by – young and old, organizers and 
attendees, students and residents – wield-
ing banners, linking arms, bringing the city 
center to a halt.
Herman Zuniga, president of Community 
Immigrants of East Haven, shouted into 
the night, his voice breaking. “I came to 
this country twenty-nine years ago. I am 
one hundred percent immigrant. I fought 
for my papers for seventeen years,” he 
told the crowd. “Who are you, Donald 
Trump, to tell us to choose between reli-
gion, color, gender, or political party? Who 
are you, Mr. Trump?”

4. Board of Alders meeting
City Hall
New Haven’s alders filed into their cham­
bers in City Hall for their first full meeting 
since Donald J. Trump became America’s 
president-elect. On Thursday evening, the 
mood was subdued; every New Haven 
alder belongs to the Democratic Party. 
Alder President Tyisha Walker of Ward 
23 called the meeting to order, and the 
alders rose for the customary prayer for 
“Divine Guidance.”
Ward 10 Alder Anna Festa walked sol-
emnly to the podium. “In light of every-
thing that’s been going on in our country 
with immigration, I thought it would be 
nice to read a biographical narrative my 
daughter wrote about her grandmother,” 
she said. 
Festa told the story of her mother, Linda, 
who immigrated from Amarosi, Italy to 
New Haven in the early nineteen-sixties. 
Linda embraced her new city, Festa said, 
finding work in a dress shop and support 
from the local Italian community. She 
soon married and began raising a family in 
her home on Orange Street.
The alders applauded as Festa returned 
to her seat. With muted efficiency, they 
moved through the items on the agenda 
and personal announcements—an 
upcoming Thanksgiving turkey drive, birth-
day wishes for an absent alder—and the 
meeting adjourned after only half an hour. 
Standing in the threshold of the cham-
bers, Ward 25 Alder Adam Marchand 
said that the election results were more 
than disappointing, especially given the 
strong voter turnout in his district. He 
emphasized that despite Trump’s threat 
to revoke federal funding for all sanctuary 
cities, New Haven would maintain its 
identity as a place of acceptance  
and refuge.
The disorientation generated by the elec-
tion seemed to linger in the chambers as 
the alders drifted out. Tidying up after-
wards, a staff member handed a copy of 
Trump’s plan for his first one hundred days 
in office to a security guard, who shook 
his head in disbelief.
