6. Planned Parenthood 
East Rock
Saturday morning
Outside the Planned Parenthood at the 
intersection of Whitney Avenue and 
Edwards Street, the first Saturday after 
Trump’s election is like most Satur­
day mornings: The clinic is performing 
abortions, and people outside are holding 
brightly colored signs, engaged in protest 
and counter-protest.
Across the street from the clinic, a pro-
choice man named Chris with a cigarette 
tucked behind one ear uses his sign to 
obscure that of a pro-life activist named 
Barrie. Hers has a picture of two ultra­
sounds with the caption: “Which of these 
two human beings was conceived in 
rape?” When Barrie moves, Chris follows 
her. She raises her sign. He raises his.   
Barrie finally says, soothingly, “I’m 
praying for you, Chris.” He angrily wheels 
around to face her, their body-length signs 
pressed together. Barrie takes off her 
sunglasses. “Back up, Chris.” He doesn’t. 
They stand in gridlock. 
Later, after moving to another side of the 
street, Chris tells me the pro-life protes-
tors are emboldened by Trump. “Their guy 
might have won the White House, but we 
will win the struggle,” he says. Eyeing 
Chris across the street, Barrie says direct 
confrontations like this are rare. “This type 
of behavior is, of course, because of the 
election,” she says.  
Chris foresees this type of conflict escalat-
ing in Trump’s America. He cites Obama’s 
plans to permanently protect Planned 
Parenthood’s funding and says: “Because 
Trump can’t do anything with the funding, 
they’ll harass patients and people like us.” 
He crosses his arms, feet firmly planted 
on the sidewalk.   
And Barrie? “I’ll be here every Saturday 
until I die,” she says, “or I move.” What 
if Trump appoints a Justice to overturn 
Roe v. Wade? “Not going to happen,” she 
sighs. “No chance.” 
At 10:30 a.m., the protest is over, and the 
sign-holders get in cars — some plastered 
with Clinton stickers, some with Trump. 
They’ll be back next Saturday. And the one 
after that. And the one after that.



**5. The Annex Club**

5. The Annex Club 
East Shore
Thursday night
 
 The Annex Club sits just off I-95 on the 
way to East Haven. Founded in 1938 as a 
center for Italian-American men, the Club 
is now run by the sons and grandsons 
of its first generation. Joe Tirotello, who 
is eighty-eight, is one of those men. At 
6:30 p.m. on November 10, he sits inside, 
having just bought a ticket for Bingo Night, 
a main source of the Annex Club’s income. 
He immediately asks me if I voted.
“I seen a lot of them,” Tirotello says of 
elections. “This is the worst one. Now 
that he’s our president, even if I don’t like 
him, I got to back him up. I did the same 
thing with Kennedy.” What makes Joe 
most unhappy, though, is the anti-Trump 
rallying occurring in downtown New 
Haven and across the country.
“I don’t really know what the hell they’re 
mad at,” he tells me. “I don’t believe in 
violence, anyways. Just makes us look like 
a bunch of idiots.”
Ed and Shirley, who, like most of the 
others I meet, have been coming to the 
Club for “too long,” sit in the back with 
their friend Gail. Shirley tells me that her 
mother wouldn’t allow her to accept a 
college scholarship “because girls don’t 
go to college.” When I ask her how she 
felt about Hillary, she tisks. “She’s just a 
liar. I think he’ll be fabulous.”
Gail, who volunteered for Trump, eagerly 
chimes in: “They’ll shoot you through your 
window if you have a Trump sign.  
It’s politics.”
Tirotello is one of the only non Trump-sup-
porters that I meet at the Annex Club, and 
the only one to bring up the election with-
out my asking, but he still joins in when 
the bingo starts. The first-place prize last 
week was five hundred dollars; tonight’s 
players are feeling lucky.



**8. Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Christ**

8. Dixwell Avenue Congregational 
United Church of Christ 
Dixwell 
Sunday morning
Until Reverend Porsha Williams’ sermon, 
the service at the Dixwell Avenue Con-
gregational United Church of Christ had 
been mostly business as usual. Couples 
smiled and greeted each other as they 
found their seats, the teen choir sang in 
rainbow stoles, and the speakers did what 
they had long planned to do that morning: 
honor their congregation’s graduates of 
the historically black Bennett and More-
house Colleges and pay tribute to their late 
pastor, Reverend Dr. Edwin R. Edmonds. 
Even the earlier mentions of Trump’s elec-
tion hadn’t relayed any shock or despair. 
“We’ve been here before,” said Toni 
Walker, a Connecticut state representative 
and the daughter of Reverend Edmonds. 
“With President Reagan, and in the early 
nineteen-hundreds. This is just a setback.”
Williams, a guest preacher, wasn’t just 
there to talk about progress and setbacks. 
“By the rivers of Babylon, we sat down 
and wept, when we remembered Zion,” 
she began her sermon, quoting Psalm 137 
and comparing the Black community to 
the Israelites in exile. “The Psalm says, 
‘For there our captors asked us for songs, 
our tormentors demanded songs of joy.’ 
But we are not here for your entertain-
ment. Our songs mean something to us, 
and we are not in Zion.”
People in the crowd started to shout in 
assent. “They are wondering how we’re 
still a people of faith. How after slavery, 
you can still smile, how after Jim Crow, 
you can still dance, how after the war 
on drugs, you can leap for joy, how after 
mass incarceration, you can still sing.” 
Nearly everyone was crying out now, 
some standing or holding up their hands. 
Williams kept speaking, louder and louder, 
without stopping to take a breath. “You 
say to them that God did that,” she said, 
“God did that all by himself.”
