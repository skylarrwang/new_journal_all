1. “What Now? What Next?” 
Dwight Chapel, Yale University
Wednesday night
The Facebook event was called “What 
Now? What Next?” But by the time some 
two hundred Yale students trickled into 
Dwight Hall’s common room on Wednes­
day night—about twenty-four hours after 
it became clear that the vast majority of 
campus had cast their vote for the losing 
candidate—the mood was less for­
ward-looking than funereal. If you believed 
the punditry, we were “the establish­
ment” Trump’s voters had punished. What 
now? What next? 
Conversations began with hugs, and they 
mostly went the same way. 
“How have you been holding up?”
“Not great.”
People sat in a circle on the hardwood 
floor, and organizers (a new group called 
the “Yale Student Group Leaders”) 
thanked everyone for coming. They 
opened the floor. A leader with Unidad 
Latina en Acción invited everyone to the 
protest Thursday evening. A representa­
tive of the Office of International Students 
& Scholars assured the crowd that Yale 
would do everything in its power to 
protect the twenty percent of its students 
who are not American citizens. A fresh­
man read a poem. He said of America, 
“What we thought it was isn’t actually 
what it is.” A boy in the corner carried 
a sign that said “White Supremacy: I’m 
Coming for That Ass.”
