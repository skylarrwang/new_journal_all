EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Situated beneath a dance floor coated in liquor and pher­
omones, the Toad’s men’s bathroom lacks the sterility of 
other men’s bathrooms on campus. I’ve only spent a few 
moments in there, and whether by chemical aid or brute 
force alone, I’ve successfully repressed most of them.


The access I have to the Toad’s men’s bathroom 
because I’m cis-ish and have a dick (score!) is a privi­
lege that I must wield responsibly. And so, on Novem­
ber 2, I descend into the bathroom corridor in the 
basement, pass the dapper, human-size, pork-pie-hat-
sporting toad encased in glass in a nook in the wall, and 
enter the men’s bathroom, where I will stand, in a stall, 
listening, for the next hour (with occasional breaks on 
the dance floor).


The bathroom is not as repulsive as it could be. It 
has three stalls, two of which lock, and six urinals. 
There are no dividers between the urinals. As most 
men’s room frequenters know, this profoundly alters 
the psychic terrain. Dividers offer privacy and lessen 
the intense homophobia that arises at the occasion of 
male genital proximity. Without them, adjacent urinals 
become fraught with this tension. Only the foolhardy 
stand at adjacent urinals without dividers. 


I know that simply scrolling through my phone 
by the sinks will not be an option—people will get 
suspicious, and in a space like the Toad’s bathroom, 
I want a door between the straight boys and me. So I 
stand in a stall—one of the two not glazed in urine—
facing the toilet. I am a full head taller than the door, 
so I know that people can see the back of my head, 
which feels awkward but is a necessary price to pay for 
investigative journalism.


Gaze is particularly dangerous in all male spaces, as 
it carries the potential of erotic desire, so occupying 
a men’s bathroom usually entails blinkering oneself, 
though normally not for the length of time I will spend 
at Toad’s. I resign myself to staring at the tiles in front 
of me, as so many men have done before, and get to 
listening. I hold my phone to the side so that it doesn’t 
fall in the toilet. I am fortunate to have a terrible sense 
of smell. 
11:48 pm: I hear a spraying sound. I am unsure of the 
source—it sounds like Axe, maybe, or another brand 
of spray-on deodorant. I don’t smell anything, though, 
except the faint aroma of urine—very curious. I recall the 
existence of lethal odorless sprayable chemicals, though I 
can’t name any, and hope that I will be okay.


11:52 pm: Two boys walk in. One boy says to the other, 
walking towards a stall: “I would not wipe the seat to take 
a fucking shit here. Are you taking a shit dude?” I panic, 
thinking he’s talking to me, but he’s not. He’s talking to 
his friend in the stall next to me, who isn’t taking a shit, 
but is peeing, like I’m pretending to be doing. I think 
about how friendship heightens the awkwardness of using 
adjacent urinals, as there is the expectation of continued 
conversation as you urinate side by side. 
11:55 pm: “She’s winning gold medals, I’m sitting here 
drinking my ass off.” One boy yells to his friend. They 
don’t seem that close.  “You’re getting too dark for the 
Toad’s bathroom, dude.” They change topics, and leave.


11:57 pm: I hear the spraying sound again. I realize it’s the 
sound of the faucet. I feel relief that I won’t perish in this 
bathroom stall, but also note that I’ve heard the sound of 
the faucet many fewer times than I’ve heard the sound 
of flushing.


12:01 am: Two boys exchange ‘sups.’ “This is the fourth 
time I’ve been down here. Pretty copious.” As someone 
who pees a lot, I feel a kinship. They begin talking about 
how much they’re sweating. “I should have worn my Yale 
cheerleading tank,” one says. “Why has my birthday hat 
not gotten any females?” the other laments. I no longer 
feel any kinship. 
12:05 am: After four minutes of silence, I begin to feel 
deeply silly, and I leave the bathroom to take a dancing 
break upstairs. Self-care is important. 
12:17 am: Someone walks in talking about not receiving a 
Snapchat from a girl. “Bitch,” he says. 


12:20 am: Two boys walk in and go to separate urinals. 
“Can you see my dick?” “No.” “Good.” There are three 
urinals separating them. 


12:22 am: Someone is vomiting in the stall next to me and 
I feel grateful that at least my knees don’t have to touch 
the floor. 


12:27 am: “I’m completely blacked out. But I’m having a 
good night.” “Cool!” I whisper to myself.  


12:29 am: “Lip Gloss” is playing, and the boy in the stall 
next to me is loudly singing along, but he doesn’t know 
any of the words. I am angry.


12:34 am: “Do you ever do this? Put paper on your dick 
when you pee?” shouts one boy from the stall next to 
me to his friends, drunkenly. “I don’t do that,” his friend 
responds. The boy defends himself: “Because you don’t 
want your underwear to be sticky!” “You don’t even have a 
girlfriend.” “I’m always prepared.”


12:37 am: Sometimes I hear boys come down and use 
neither the urinal nor the stalls. When I cautiously turn 
my head just enough to see into the bathroom over the 
top of the stall door, I see boys looking at themselves in 
the mirror, or at their phone, simply needing some space 
from the occasionally overwhelming party upstairs. See­
ing these boys in their quiet vulnerability gives me some 
of my few moments of warmth. 


12:46 am: Two boys walk in. “Are they actually dating 
now? Are they for sure dating?” one of them asks. “I don’t 
even think she’s that hot,” his friend reassures him. They 
high-five, I think. 


12:48 am: At the hour mark of my entrance, I decide that 
I’ve spent enough time in the bathroom, and turn to 
depart. When I do so, I accidentally make eye contact 
with someone at a urinal. It is a genuinely uncomfortable 
moment. I wash my hands and leave.
