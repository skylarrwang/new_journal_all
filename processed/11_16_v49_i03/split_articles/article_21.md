EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On Election Day, New Haven was on the wrong side of a 
historic upset. Over thirty-four thousand Elm City voters cast 
ballots for Hillary Clinton; just under five thousand chose 
president-elect Donald J. Trump. After the race was over—
settled in far-away places like southwest Virginia and Kenosha 
County, Wisconsin—the result dominated conversations all 
over the city, sparking endless debates about its significance 
and what to expect from a Trump presidency. The following 
vignettes are not meant to offer a comprehensive portrait of 
New Haven residents’ reactions. Rather, they offer glimpses 
into the ways people respond to national division, 
whether in a school, on the street, or in a church.
This is how uncertainty 
in America felt in the wake of 
November 8, 2016.
