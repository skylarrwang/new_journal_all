“How do I feel?” asks Orbel, one of the 
other people at the bar who is sipping a 
pink cocktail and talking to his friend in 
Spanish. He hesitates for a few moments, 
as if to gird himself for the answer. “I’m 
not afraid.” 
Orbel—whose name is an amalgamation 
of Isabel and Orlando—moved from his 
native Puerto Rico after earning his busi-
ness degree there in 2012, and he’s been 
working at a consulting firm in the North-
east ever since. “The laws were passed—
they can’t just change them.” He worries 
about new appointments to the Supreme 
Court, though, not to mention how people 
might treat him outside places like this. “I 
guess I’m fifty percent afraid.”
For Jerimarie Liesegang, a Trump White 
House is no great surprise. “Is it shock-
ing?” she laughed. “No. It’s the last 
gasp of the great white group.” When 
Liesegang transitioned in the nineties, 
there were even fewer legal protections 
for trans people, which inspired her to 
found the Connecticut TransAdvocacy 
Coalition almost twenty years ago. She’s 
not convinced that queer youth, especially 
queer people of color, are much safer now. 
She points out that you can still get fired in 
most states for being gay or trans. 
As for the next four years, her plans hav-
en’t much changed. “All I can say is I’m 
going to keep trying to fuck the system.” 
I ask her if she sees a storm gathering. 
She shakes her head. It’s been raging for 
a while, she says, and storms like these 
never really pass.
