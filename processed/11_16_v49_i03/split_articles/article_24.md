7. Downtown
Saturday night
DJ Gabby plays Top 40 and Latin hits at 
Partners Cafe on Saturdays like this, but 
tonight, after the presidential election, the 
dance floor is deserted. Beyoncé plays in 
the bar downstairs. I’m sitting next to a 
couple of hockey players in Yale jerseys 
who are finishing their beers, wondering 
if the Rangers are still up. Across the bar, 
two locals boasting chest tattoos and 
green lipstick debrief the election in half­
hearted murmurs.
