of an animal, maybe a horse or a camel, rests on the 
site’s sloping terrain. An aged crucifix, which has since 
been removed from the property, used to lay horizon­
tally, marked with graffiti reading “God is dead.”
Chloe Ottman, like many of her peers, was intrigued 
by Holy Land’s seedy mystery. The abandoned park did 
not scare her. Ottman’s father, Derek, told me that his 
daughter had a passion for the underdog and a nev­
er-ceasing urge to cheer people up. Friends of Chloe’s 
tenderly recall the lengths to which she would go to 
make them smile, trying goofy faces and sometimes even 
using her hands to force the corners of her classmates’ 
mouths upward. Curiosity spurred her to leave her house 
by 7:30 a.m. some weekends to explore Waterbury, the 
city where she grew up. She would later describe these 
daylong outings with her friends in lengthy Facebook 
posts, calling them “Epic Adventures.” 
On July 15, 2010, Ottman, who was sixteen at the 
time, agreed to join a friend of her boyfriend, whom 
she had met at several parties, Francisco Cruz, Jr., at 
Holy Land as part of an “Epic Adventure” he planned 
for her. Ottman and Cruz sat at the base of the crucifix, 
chatting and sipping Joose, a caffeinated malt drink. 
Soon after they sat down, Cruz made sexual advances 
toward Ottman, which she rebuffed. Cruz attempted to 
grope Ottman. She elbowed him in the face, knocking 
his glasses to the ground. Cruz became enraged. He 
strangled Ottman and raped her. Unsure if she was still 
alive, Cruz stabbed her several times and left her body 
in a nearby wooded area.
The next day, Ottman’s family reported her missing; 
Cruz confessed to the crime two days later. He initially 
pled guilty but later withdrew his plea. Facing the pos­
sibility of going to trial, Chloe’s mother wanted to push 
for the death penalty but her father feared the lengthy 
trial that it would entail. Cruz finally agreed to plea 
guilty again if the rape charge was dropped. Ottman’s 
father reluctantly agreed, admitting that it was “fucked 
up.” Cruz is now serving fifty-five years in state prison.
Following the murder, the Religious Teachers of 
Filippini vacated the property and moved to Morris­
town, New Jersey. As Derek Ottman remembers, the 
organization was unresponsive to his inquiries about 
Holy Land’s future. What were their plans for the 
property? What were they going to do about the blood-
stained concrete? Could they build a fence to keep 
future trespassers out? The nuns said they would have 
to confer with the heads of the religious order in Rome. 
They never got back to him. (The provincial supervisor 
of Holy Land at that time of his attempts has since died, 
according to Sister Ascenza of the order, who spoke to 
me over the phone from Morristown.) 
Although Derek Ottman does not blame the religious 
order for his daughter’s murder, he admits that some 
resentment lingered for a while. Pagano, on the other 
hand, adamantly insists that the crime was not a prod­
uct of Holy Land itself or its managers. He attributes the 
death to circumstance. He told me, “Holy Land hap­
pened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

who owns a car dealership. As O’Leary recalls, “I called 
him up and said, ‘What are you doing right now?’ And 
he said, ‘I just came off the golf course.’ And I said, 
‘Come up to Holy Land.’”
O’Leary says that the idea for Holy Land’s resurrec­
tion didn’t come as an epiphany, but rather a gradual 
realization. When he had campaigned for mayor ear­
lier in 2011, he made a point to visit Waterbury’s retire­
ment homes. Across the board, seniors’ biggest request 
was to illuminate the cross once more. Once elected, 
he called the realtor of the Holy Land property and 
learned that the nuns, who still owned it, were asking 
for $750,000 for the 17.7 acres (city records indicate 
the property is worth roughly $1.24 million). Knowing 
that he could never fundraise this sum, the new mayor 
let the idea go. Three years later, however, O’Leary and 
Blasius decided to jointly purchase Holy Land using 
money that they would fundraise on their own.
Holy Land’s restoration (and Mayor O’Leary’s leader­
ship of the movement) has not received any significant 
opposition. Still, an elected official’s advocacy for a reli­
gious site intuitively raises some red flags. Discussing 
Holy Land’s recent history in his office, Mayor O’Leary 
cuts himself off mid-sentence. “I’ve got to make sure 
you understand only one thing so far: this has nothing 
to do with the city of Waterbury. I’m the mayor, but this 
was not done with me being a representative of the city, 
because that would be a big problem with separation of 
church and state.” I nod. He pauses, leans heavily into 
his chair, and dives back into the story.
After some negotiating, O’Leary and Blasius con­
vinced the nuns to listen to their pitch. The day of 
their meeting, the men awoke early and drove to Mor­
ristown, New Jersey. The meeting began sharply at 10 
a.m. There was no small talk—O’Leary sat with a cup 
of coffee in one hand and a Danish in the other, he 
says, waiting for the women to speak. 
In the meeting, O’Leary and Blasius explained their 
motivation for buying the property, promising that they 
would never change it into a hotel or let the land be 
mined. By the end of the day, the nuns agreed to sell the 
listing for $350,000. As part of the deal, the land deed 
required that the property always remain Holy Land.
Three years later, at Holy Land’s second annual ban­
quet at La Bella Vista Banquet Hall, Jennifer Carroll, a 
senior at Holy Cross Catholic High School, concludes 
her speech. “I realize that God does not just let bad 
things happen in our world. He gave us free will, which 
makes any outcome possible,” she projects slowly into 
the microphone. She and Katerina Valenti are the 2016 
winners of Holy Land’s high school essay competition, 
for which students write personal statements about 
what Holy Land means to them. The young women 
stand by the podium as Rebecca Calabrese awards 
them one thousand dollars each to help fund their col­
lege educations.
Near the center of the ballroom, Joe Pisani sits with 
ten talkative family members and friends at a table 
marked “Pisani Steel.” To this crowd, his name alone is 
enough to stir approving murmurs. In 2013, soon after 
the purchase of Holy Land, Pisani agreed to construct 
a new lighted steel cross, entirely free of charge. His 
company was determined to build a crucifix larger than 
any of its predecessors. The project required roughly 
$300,000 worth of material.
On Friday, December 20, 2013, a crane erected 
the cross on Pine Hill, where it now sits on a hundred 
square foot base. The cross was illuminated for the first 
time in years, just in time for Christmas. Ten thou­
sand Waterbury residents, Catholics and non-Catho­
lics alike, came to watch the lighting ceremony. Even 
Waterbury’s Albanian Muslim community was in atten­
dance. Some Waterbury residents say that traffic came 
to a halt on I-84 that day; regardless of their religious 
affiliation, people were leaning out their windows to try 
to catch a better look. Holy Land—they could finally 
see—was not lost.

Derek Ottman was not included in planning for 
the cross-raising ceremony and I wasn’t able to get in 
touch with Chloe’s mother for this piece. (The two 
are now divorced.) Mayor O’Leary initially told me 
that Ottman’s parents were in attendance, but he later 
retracted this claim, saying that he only heard of their 
presence second-hand through a police officer. The 
Mayor acknowledges the role of Ottman’s death in the 
restoration process. “I think that it inspired a lot of peo­
ple to step forward,” he says. She seems to serve as an 
unspoken martyr for the movement. Neither of the two 
Holy Land writing competition winners mention her 
in their essays, and her name goes entirely unspoken at 
the annual banquet.
After the cross began to shine again in 2013, the resto­
ration movement continued to pick up steam. They’ve 
received donations from more than 4,500 individuals 
in the past two years. At this year’s banquet, they’ve set 
a goal of raising eighty thousand dollars to cover the 
material cost of constructing a new Holy Land sign. 
Mayor O’Leary grabs the microphone and calls on the 
attendees to make monetary pledges. They auction 
off the letters from the old sign for five thousand dol­
lars each. (O’Leary revealed before the banquet that 
he pre-sold three of the letters.) After the letters are 
auctioned, people raise their hands to pledge smaller 
amounts. O’Leary publically thanks each individual 
by name, congratulating several donors on their recent 
retirements or upcoming marriages.
“Lot of Irish names here tonight!” O’Leary remarks. 
One of the men at the Pisani table promptly raises his 
hand to place a bid. O’Leary squints before recognizing 
his friend from across the room. “I knew if I challenged 
these Italian guys they’d step it up.”
Between dinner courses, two priests in clerical collars 
examine tickets to a Yankees/Red Sox game at the silent 
auction. A group of Sacred Hearth High School students 
huddle around a table selling limited-edition Holy Land 
Timex watches. A Waterbury-based cover band takes the 
stage. Mickey, the group’s bassist, leans into the micro­
phone. “We love Holy Land. We actually do.”
The absence of Chloe Ottman’s parents goes unmen­
tioned. The two have maintained a low-profile since 
their tragedy. Derek Ottman made a GoFundMe page 
last year, hoping to raise $25,000 to return to school 
to become a writer (he has raised $678 as of this writ­
ing). On his fundraising page, he states that he’s on a 
mission from God, writing that he’s trying to shake his 
former life plans: “I’ve given up the stifling but ‘sure 
thing’ path my risk-averse-father-of-a-murdered-teen­
ager brain wants.” Before Chloe’s death, a leaky roof 
damaged the family’s house, taking down an entire wall 
in her room. Derek wasn’t able to fix it before she died. 
More than five years later, the house repairs are still 
incomplete. “The weight of unfinished business is part 
of the brain feeling sorry for itself,” he explains. Derek 
writes that after trauma, he initially found messiness to 
be comforting. Five years later though, he knows it’s 
time to move forward, for himself and for Chloe, who 
he believes would want for people to relate to each 
other even when circumstances are difficult. He’s not 
focusing on Holy Land as a path forward anymore.
Long after dark, the silent auction winners are 
announced and the banquet’s attendees slowly trickle 
out of La Bella Vista. Mickey packs up his bass and 
the Holy Land vision boards are taken down from the 
entrance. The parking lot is illuminated as a hundred 
cars turn on their headlights and migrate toward the 
venue’s winding exit. Volunteers will be on-site at Holy 
Land by 11am tomorrow to continue restoration work, 
but until then, the cross stands alone on Pine Hill, hov­
ering above the old manufacturing town.
Far below the cross, Chloe Monique Ottman’s grave 
reads, “We love you… forever.” Six years following her 
death though, her memory remains more prevalent in 
some people’s minds than others’. Holy Land has risen 
from tragedy, but the role of Ottman’s murder in the 
process of restoration continues to be dubious. Maybe 
forgetting violence in order to overcome it is produc­
tive, a way of honoring her. On the other hand, the 
potential to take advantage of trauma in order to moti­
vate the redemption of a space is ethically challeng­
ing. The Bible assures followers that challenges can be 
overcome; Isaiah promises redemptive glory for the fol­
lowers of the Lord: “Violence shall no more be heard 
in your land, devastation or destruction within your 
borders; you shall call your walls Salvation, and your 
gates Praise” (Isaiah 60:18). But the role of memory is 
ambiguous. Maybe we serve ourselves best by moving 
on, but what do we lose in disremembering trauma? If 
you turn your head as you leave Waterbury on I-84, you 
can catch a glimpse of the glowing cross one last time, 
its LED lighting glowing on the horizon.
