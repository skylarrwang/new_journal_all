The death of Thailand’s monarch reaches New Haven
At Dwight Hall on October 18, the dress code is black. 
King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand has died, and over 
one hundred people from Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
and Rhode Island have congregated at a service organized 
by Thai undergraduates at Yale. Among the mourners are 
the staff of New Haven’s Thai and Thai-owned restau­
rants: Thai Taste, Pad Thai, Anaya’s Sushi, York Street 
Noodle Place, and Jeera Thai. As people come forward 
to place candles and flowers on the altar, they touch their 
brows to the ground in prayer to a printed image of the 
late king: a symbol of a symbol. Some cry. Others want a 
nice photo. When a satisfactory picture is taken, a com­
mand follows: “Put it on Face.” “Face” is Thai slang for 
Facebook, and tonight the phrase is as ubiquitous as “Rest 
in peace.”
“He’s at peace now,” said Mo, the co-owner of Thai 
Taste, of the king. Her sadness, she told me, was self­
ish. Several days after the service, she still wore black 
to observe the yearlong mourning period. In Thailand, 
there has been public concern about a shortage of 
black clothing; state banks have pledged to distribute 
black clothing to eight million low-income people. 
When I went to Thai Taste to interview her, Mo sta­
tioned us in the dark, slim corridor leading into the 
restaurant’s dining room, away from the staff, sprawled 
and sleeping on couches during the long afternoon. A 
picture of Queen Sirikit, now solitary, hung in the cor­
ridor. The picture of the king that used to hang beside 
hers had been relocated to a small shrine by the door.
We spoke under the watch of the portraits in the 
lamplight. “The king was completely selfless,” Mo 
said. “He was really a deity.” She added in English, “An 
angel.” Then, in Thai, “I’m grateful to have been born 
during his reign.” Mo grew up during the king’s most 
active years, the nineteen-seventies and eighties, when 
the Royal Projects—his policy initiatives, related pri­
marily to agriculture and flood diversion—and media 
coverage thereof were at their peak. “I grew up seeing 
the king’s deeds on TV. I’ve always been used to it.”
Over the course of his seventy-year reign, the king, 
who died October 13 of lung and kidney complica­
tions, built up a formidable cult of personality. In the 
Thai public media network, he is commonly referred 
to as the “father of the land.” Portraits of him, like the 
one enshrined at Thai Taste, are omnipresent. In Bang­
kok alone, hundreds of thousands of people celebrated 
his birthday annually at Sanam Luang, a public square 
in front of the Grand Palace—Mo herself attended the 
celebration two years ago. 
Growing up in Bangkok, where I lived before com­
ing to Yale, I participated in this widespread adoration. 
The king wasn’t a tyrannical leader; nevertheless, his 
illustration ivy sanders schneider

cult of personality rests on questionable grounds. The 
idea of his unequivocal goodness has been sustained 
through the suppression of uglier details, like his com­
plicity in the massacre of university students in 1976.
Articles written in English—by BBC News, The New 
York Times, and The Economist, for instance—cite lèse-
majesté laws, which criminalize insults to the monar­
chy, as the reason for the absence of visible opposition. 
However, this explanation is incomplete. A great num­
ber of Thai people feel genuine love for the king, and 
so revere the monarchy that to speak against it would 
be unthinkable—even in New Haven, far from puni­
tive forces in Thailand. The five people I spoke to—
staff at Thai and Thai-owned restaurants—all said that 
they loved the king and cried at the news of his death.
Down the street from Thai Taste, pictures of the 
monarchy are also on display at Pad Thai. Nat, a wait­
ress there, made Thai tea for her friend Ped, Pad Thai’s 
chef Mai, and me as we talked about life in America. 
“I live simply,” said Mai. “Just like our king said: suffi­
ciency.” She was referring to the doctrine proposed by 
the king that advocates a life of moderation. The den­
tistry museum of Chulalongkorn University, Thailand’s 
oldest university, established by King Chulalongkorn, 
houses a tube of toothpaste, purportedly used by King 
Bhumibol, that has been squeezed completely flat—
evidence of his modesty in spite of his wealth and 
power. He was considered a moral leader, unlike his 
son Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is thrice 
married and divorced, and is widely perceived as adul­
terous and hedonistic.
Mo has spent seven years in America; Mai, thirteen 
or fourteen. Trips home are expensive and rare. Even 
so, their statements of veneration sounded like those of 
Thais who had never left Thai soil. 
This bond with Thailand isn’t sustained through a 
Thai community. “We’re here to work. It’s every man 
for himself,” Mo told me. She plans to return to 
Thailand after retirement—New Haven merely pro­
vides a quiet space in which to make a living.
Instead, the bond is conserved technologically. 
Everyone I spoke to streams the same three Thai news 
channels. The Royal Thai Army manages one, and the 
state-owned public broadcaster manages the other two. 
All are conservative. Most of New Haven’s Thai res­
idents don’t watch English-language news channels. 
They’re not interested, or don’t find Thailand, as they 
think of it, correctly represented.
Facebook and Line, a messaging app, are also central 
to keeping in touch with home. Both serve the double 
function of communication platform and news source. 
Paq, a waiter at Anaya Sushi, couldn’t tell me which 
online journals specifically served as his news sources: 
“I just saw it on Face.” This immersion in social media 
is accompanied by a comparatively sparse social life in 
New Haven. When I asked Paq what he does in his free 
time, he said, “I go home and sleep.” In the absence of a 
community in New Haven, Facebook provides a virtual 
replica of the social circles Thais inhabited back home. 
Because Facebook is a global public network, it also 
extends the threat of repression all the way to New 
Haven. This past May, eight people were charged with 
sedition for mocking the military junta on Facebook, 
and the threat of repression now hangs, however lightly, 
over the site. “It’s not right to share such things,” said 
Mo, of a New York Times article about the king’s death 
in which the crown prince was spoken of unfavorably. 
She shook her head. “It’s too blunt.” It’s difficult to tell 
whether Mo’s criticism stems from the potential legal 
consequences or from a cultural norm of deference to 
the monarchy—the two reinforce each other even on 
this relatively new platform. Facebook makes Thailand 
immediate in every sense but the physical.
This immediacy is palpable on the night of the 
memorial service. After a group picture is taken, a 
man rouses everyone to sing the King’s Anthem. Some 
people, such as the initiator, are filled with patriotic 
furor: they sing vigorously, stridently. Some continue 
to weep. Paq appreciates the solidarity the service pro­
vides. But Mo feels a little lost and disconnected. She 
pictures Sanam Luang on the king’s birthday two years 
ago, packed with people who looked upon each other 
with automatic love. In America, she says, the looks are 
blank, or guarded. In Thailand, the candles are real—
not electric, like the ones at the Dwight Hall service or 
at Thai Taste’s shrine. The unity created by the king, 
she says, is real.
Was real. It was fragile enough while he was alive, 
she says. Thailand has undergone two military coups 
in the past decade; the 2014 coup was preceded by six 
months of protests. The crown prince is unpopular. 
What will come of it now?
 “I can’t die here,” Mo said of America. “It’s too 
expensive.” She wants to return, and to be buried in 
Thai soil. Internally, she’s barely left. The Thai resi­
dents of New Haven are satellites—projected from 
Thailand, orbiting solitarily, carrying their particular 
notions of home, waiting to return.
