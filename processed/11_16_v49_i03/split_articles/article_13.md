THE  NEW  JOURNAL
friends who I met in other ways, and I had never really 
connected with the peer liaison I was assigned when I 
matriculated. But my association with the News even­
tually made me feel unwelcome at the House. Some­
how, I had almost become less black.

My first visit to the House was in November of 2015, 
less than two months after I had become a News editor. 
Risë Nelson, the House’s director, had sent the paper’s 
senior editors an email with the subject line “Need to 
Meet.” She alleged that the News’ reporting was poten­
tially dangerous to communities of color, explaining 
that our coverage of the recent protests over racial dis­
crimination on campus had been poorly sourced and 
disengaged, and “many underrepresented students, 
faculty and administrators are unwilling to speak with 
the YDN.” And when we quoted her in the paper, we 
consistently neglected to include an umlaut over the 
“e” in her first name. 

The News and the Af-Am House have been neigh­
bors since 1970, when the House moved to its current 
location at 211 Park. The relationship between the 
News and the black community has historically been 
turbulent, but the headquarters of both groups are con­
nected by the red brick that lies between them. There 
are no gaps, no pauses in the hundred-foot wall extend­
ing from 202 York to 211 Park. If a bomb detonates in 
one building, violent tremors rock the other. This is 
how it has always been.  

Two years ago, the bomb was Rodney Cohen, Assis­
tant Dean of Yale College and the center’s former 
director. During his time as director, students insisted 
that Cohen had failed the House: he was consistently 
absent, and he mismanaged resources. They had lodged 
complaints against Cohen in 2010, when they requested 
that he complete more training or risk removal from his 
post. Four years later, 147 students signed a sixty-nine-
page petition of grievances against Cohen. 

In February 2015, the Yale Daily News wrote a 
“News’ View” calling for Cohen’s removal, but it was 
too late. His poor leadership had gone uncovered by 
campus publications for years, contributing to the most 
common criticism the News receives from communi­
ties of color: we pester them, ask them questions, and 
give them attention when something terrible has hap­
pened that we simply consider “news.” But most of the 
time we don’t pay attention. We don’t cover the less 
obvious things: the events, conferences, and rallies—
stories that still deserve to be told. 

I spent 2014 reporting on admissions and financial 
aid for the News, and I was fairly removed from the 
Dean Cohen situation. It wasn’t on my “beat,” and I 
had also never stepped foot inside the House. All of 
my free time was spent doing things for the News or 
thinking about doing things for the News. I watched 
my fellow reporters struggle to cover the situation with 
Dean Cohen, and I overheard students taking issue 
with their coverage. But at that point, it was still their 
coverage: articles written and edited by other people. I 
did not consider myself complicit. I covered the Office 
of Undergraduate Admissions.     

Last November, when I was on the editorial board, 
students of color confronted former Silliman Head of 
College Nicholas Christakis in the Silliman courtyard 
and stood on cross campus telling stories of discrimi­
nation and abuse to Dean Jonathan Holloway. Criti­
cisms of News coverage arose again, and this time I felt 
responsible for every single thing that was printed in 
the paper. Students condemned us for not including 
their side of the story while simultaneously declining 
our requests for comment. Communities of color said 
we were too gentle toward SAE (the frat now known as 
Leo) and Nicholas and Erika Christakis. In a Washing­
ton Post op-ed last month, Erika Christakis claimed the 
News misrepresented what happened last year in a way 
that indicated our bias and pushed she and her hus­
band out of their administrative positions. When both 
sides claim you’re biased against them, whom could 
you possibly be biased toward? 

The insensitivity went both ways. One afternoon 
that November, a News editor saw someone spit on 
our building as they walked by. Reporters reached 
out to student activists who said they had been told by 
group leaders to never speak to the News. Comments 
posted on Overheard at Yale referred to the News as 
“trash” and “racist.” At a race teach-in at Woolsey Hall, 
attended by over a thousand students, speakers lead­
ing the teach-in asked News reporters in the audience 
to stand up and identify themselves. “This meeting is 
OFF THE RECORD,” the event leader announced, as 
two News reporters stood up in a sea of one thousand. 
The audience cheered. 

Before our meeting with Dean Nelson, my two white, 
female co-editors and I gathered at the Yale Daily News 
building. We were going to walk to the House together, 
and this time I would actually go inside. 

In an ideal world, I would have been an active mem­
ber of both spaces. I would have been best friends with 
Dean Nelson, or, better yet, like a daughter to her. 
I would have seen the House as a source of comfort 
rather than as a source of unease. I would have written 
every headline with the utmost sensitivity. I would have 
known the right things to say and when to say them. 
And I would have felt black, truly and completely 
black, even though my father is white. I would have

been a person of color first, and a journalist second, 
or figured out how to be a journalist of color, because 
apparently people can do that. I would have felt like an 
asset rather than a liability to both. Instead, I was just 
someone who crossed the walkway with her head down. 

During that fifty-six second walk, I wondered whether 
Dean Nelson would be surprised to find out that I was 
half black. I wondered if she’d think I was racist any­
way. I wondered if that would mean I was. 

I sat down with other Yale Daily News staffers and 
editors of color, some of whom are more active at the 
Af-Am House than I am. They shared a similar sen­
timent. As Coryna Ogunseitan said, when it comes 
to bridging the gap between the News and the Af-Am 
House, “there’s no one on campus who’s comfort­
able in both spaces.” Ogunseitan, a senior who is half 
Nigerian, used to edit WEEKEND, the News’ arts and 
culture section. Ogunseitan said that she constantly 
emphasized the distinction between WEEKEND and 
the rest of the News during her time at the paper, 
because she found certain coverage printed in the rest 
of the YDN, especially that of SAE, to be “indefensi­
ble” in how it allowed SAE to justify itself. She also told 
me that she tended to downplay her connection with 
the News while at the House. 

Both places seem to have “prerequisites” for entry, 
said Tasnim Elboute, who is North African and a senior 
photographer for the News.  You must have dark enough 
skin to make it at the House; you need to write hard-hit­
ting articles, often on just a few topics, to be embraced 
at the News. She said she’s heard people discuss the 
notion that an association with the News can almost 
seem to “delegitimize your blackness” at the House. 

And while several people said their connection to 
the News made it difficult for them to spend time at 
the Af-Am House, sophomore Ellie Pritchett claimed 
the opposite. At the News, Pritchett always felt like peo­
ple viewed her as “the activist one” who was slightly 
out of place. Pritchett has stopped designing pages for 
the News. Instead she’s serving as Editor-in-Chief of 
DOWN Magazine, a publication written by and for 
students of color at Yale.

As it turned out, Dean Nelson didn’t think I was 
racist. She just thought that we could do better. After 
the meeting, we made a concerted effort to cover more 
things happening at the cultural centers, stories that 
were unrelated to the protests. We pledged to remem­
ber her umlaut. But students of color still often decline 
to speak with the News.

When thinking about the two spaces now, I start with 
the windows. Both buildings have the same ornate glass 
portals to the outside. If a window from one building 
were to shatter, you could replace it with a window 
from the other. No one would notice. 

Both buildings have the same winding staircase. The 
Af-Am House has its Founders’ Room, with paintings of 
famous black alumni: Sylvia Arden Boone, John Blass­
ingame, Armstead Robinson. And the Yale Daily News 
has its Reporters’ Room, covered in past A1s: “Alums 
lock tomb after Bones taps women,” “Yale overhauls 
financial aid,” “BODY FOUND.”

I’ve spent most of my life trying not to think about 
color, maybe because it’s just too hard. Elboute 
described the News’ proximity to the Af-Am House as 
“a machine of whiteness operating next to a space ded­
icated to blackness.” But I try to dwell on how red both 
buildings are, constructed from the same brick.

If it’s a Monday, you can hear drums when walking 
past the House. And you can see students inside the 
building, thumbing through textbooks, inserting pods 
into a Keurig machine, throwing their heads back in 
laughter. The windows are open, the lights are on, and 
there are portraits of people you don’t recognize hang­
ing on the walls. Everyone inside is black, and so are 
you. Second fifty-six. You keep walking.
