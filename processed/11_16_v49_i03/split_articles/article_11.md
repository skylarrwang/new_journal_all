With plans to highlight its African art collection, the YUAG grapples 
with its limitations

When future visitors to the Yale University Art Gallery 
enter the lobby, they will turn to the left after checking 
their coats and see the new occupant of the museum’s 
coveted first-floor space: the African art collection. 
The Gallery is moving the collection from its current 
location upstairs to the first floor, one of the most prominent gallery spaces in the building. In the old exhibit, 
statues stood on island-like platforms around the room, 
masks hung from the walls, and artifacts rested in glass 
cases. Works made centuries apart sat close together: 
pieces like a twentieth-century Ode-Lay mask from 
Sierra Leone appeared near small terracotta heads 
made by the Nok people of Nigeria in 900 BCE. They 
were united only continentally, with no indication of 
the massive shifts in time, space, and cultural conditions that occurred between the points of their creation. 
The pieces themselves were clustered haphazardly, 
and other elements of the display exacerbated the 
experience. According to Curator of Education Ryan 
Hill, the old African gallery was designed to make visitors feel as if they were “in Africa,” recreating an ambiance intended to convey the atmosphere in which the 
works originally existed: the walls were painted purple 
and covered with maps and big photographs of people 
and landscapes. Yet very little was done to contextualize the collection.


Barbara Plankensteiner, the Frances and Benjamin 
Benenson Foundation Curator of African Art at the 
YUAG, took umbrage with the hodgepodge nature of 
the African collection and its contrived presentation. 
The new space—her first project at the Gallery since 
being hired last year—will be much like those of the 
modern galleries, with no extra maps or photographic 
adornment. The transformation requires YUAG curators to wrestle with questions inherent to museum work 
and unique to the challenge of presenting African 
art in a Western museum. Take, for example, a squat 
wooden figure in the collection from the Songye culture in the Congo. The sculpture measures about four 
feet tall, its face peppered with metal studs, its head 
adorned with dark brown feathers. It’s called a “community power figure,” and it is an example of a nkishi, 
an object inhabited by a spirit, considered by art historians to be a form of “process art.” Process art is only 
complete in a set of specific circumstances. The community power figure, while considered powerful even 
when unused, is only able to reach its full potential 
when used for a ceremony. It can never be complete 
in a gallery space; it is impossible for the YUAG, or 
any traditional museum, to fully do the work justice. 
By contrast, most artwork displayed in the YUAG, and 
art museums generally, can be considered “statement 
art”—intended for viewing as-is, completed once the 
artist has put their final touches on the work. 


How do you honor something in a museum, outside its native time and space, without exoticizing it? 
Is it possible? Unlike the African gallery, the Asian 
and European galleries were not laid out to make 
anyone feel as if they were “in Asia” or “in Europe.” 
This approach, Plankensteiner said, made the African 
collection “other.” “These are works of art,” Plankensteiner said. “Once they enter the museum space, they 
enter a different world, and we do not need to recreate 
an ambiance.”


Now, Plankensteiner will display the art of the African collection in a loosely chronological order, grouping pieces to highlight specific themes: original function, spirituality, and materiality, the latter including 
empowered objects (like nkishi) which hold direct ties 
to religion. Plankensteiner wants to go digital, too, 
using videos of dances and ceremonies to simulate how 
works were utilized and seen in their original environments. She also wants to curate comprehensive exhibits dedicated to African contemporary art, which would 
be a first for the YUAG.


Plankensteiner hopes that the ritual figures and 
masks from Central and West Africa— what Picasso 
would have termed “primitive” and what were all the 
rage for collectors in the early- to mid-twentieth century—will not be the sole image people think of when 
they picture an entire continent’s art history. But there 
are still limitations within the collection itself that cannot be fixed with a new arrangement. 


The YUAG’s African Art collection comes almost 
entirely from three sources: the 1954 donation of the 
Linton collection, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. James M. 
Osborn, the 2004 gift of nearly six hundred objects from 
the personal collection of Charles B. Benenson, and 
the gift of roughly two hundred pieces from SusAnna 
and Joel B. Grae in 2010. The collection, then, is not 
encyclopedic but rather an index of its donors’ personal 
tastes. That is not unusual for the YUAG; most collections in the Gallery come from a handful of donors. 
When it comes to the collection of non-Western art, 
the tastes of the donors conform to what is popular in 
Western eyes. In the African Art collection, this means 
a very limited scope of masks and ritual figures from 
West and Central Africa. Other departments also have 
funds made up of alumni donations for purchasing new 
works and expanding their collections; the African Art 
department does not. 


These limitations are present in most Western 
museum collections of African art, said Daniel Magaziner, an associate professor of twentieth-century African history at Yale. There is a long period of time in 
African art history that we know very little about, for 
Western collectors were not interested in the work, and 
so very little research has been done on the subject. As 
a result, contemporary African art in the gallery seems 
to come out of nowhere, although generations of artists 
and evolving art forms occurred in between. Plankensteiner hopes that more will be added to the collection 
in this respect, but for now, she said, this is what the 
YUAG has. And so long as the YUAG’s donors are not 
interested in African work beyond what’s already here, 
it will not be represented in the collection. 


The possibility of increasing the museum’s holdings 
of contemporary African art brings up a question about 
the YUAG’s division of its holdings: When should artwork be included in the Modern and Contemporary 
section instead of a geographic collection? What, in this 
case, makes a recent work distinctly “African” enough 
to be included in the African collection? Is it based on 
the nationality of the artist, or the subject of their work? 
Magaziner pointed out that last fall, when the YUAG 
presented a large exhibit of the work of William Kentridge, a prominent white South African artist whose 
work deals explicitly with social and racial politics of 
South Africa, the exhibit was not billed as “African” or 
linked to the African collection. Kentridge’s artwork is 
clearly African, so why was it excluded from the African 
collection? Since Plankensteiner plans to display contemporary work in the new gallery space and hopes to 
expand and diversify the collection, these are questions 
that need to be asked—and answered consistently—as 
the collection moves forward.
