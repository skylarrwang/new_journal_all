On the J4 bus to Waterbury, I pulled out my notebook 
and wrote two lines: “Isabel Gillis,” my distant English 
relative, and “my mom’s mom’s mom’s grave,” the reason 
I was on the bus. It was a blustery mid-September day, and 
I was headed to meet Isabel so that we could tour old fam­
ily dwellings together. The bus slowly made its way from 
the New Haven Green, passing through a landscape of 
strip malls and overgrown medians. 


In 1909, my great-great grandfather John Gillis 
immigrated to the United States from Ludgvan, a small 
town in Cornwall, England. He arrived in New York 
City on Christmas Eve and soon moved to Waterbury, 
seeking work in a brass mill. By 1948, the year he died, 
Waterbury had become the center of brass production 
in the United States, earning the nickname “The Brass 
City.” The city’s official motto is Quid Aere Perennius, 
Latin for “What is more lasting than brass?” The indus­
try has long since collapsed, but in John Gillis’s day, 
it was thriving, unlike the Cornish mining industry he 
left behind.


Until recently, I knew none of this. All of this infor­
mation came from Isabel, my grandmother’s cousin, 
who traveled to Connecticut to see John’s grave as part 
of a longer genealogical trip through America. The 
trip was the culmination of several years of research 
into her family’s history, which included a large fam­
ily reunion last summer to which I wasn’t invited. 
Through my grandmother, Isabel found out I went to 
Yale and emailed me, asking if I wanted to come along 
to Waterbury. I told Isabel that, yes, I was interested in 
seeing the graves, and that I wanted to learn a bit more 
about my genealogy. But, in the back of my mind, I 
thought it seemed like a story better told than experi­
enced first-hand. One twenty-email thread on renting 
cars later, I was off to meet her in Waterbury. 


Isabel picked me up at the bus stop in her Zipcar. 
She was in her sixties, older than she sounded on the 
phone, with short grey hair and ruddy cheeks. I had 
been worrying about what one wears to the graves of 
long-dead relatives, and I eventually settled on a black 
shirt with a picture of ruins on it. She was wearing a 
loud floral print dress, navy blue leggings, and a large 
floppy hat. She pulled over to the side of the street, 
took out her tablet, and opened up a PowerPoint titled 
“Isaac’s Waterbury Adventure.” During a fifteen minute 
tour through various Ancestry.com files, she showed 
me our family tree and several census records. Pointing 
at my great grandmother’s signature on her naturaliza­
tion form, she exclaimed, “That’s her signature, she 
wrote that!”


As we started driving to the Pine Grove Cemetery, 
she told me the story of how she got interested in our 
family’s history. Her brother had visited Ellis Island 
a few years ago and called her, saying, “I found our 
grandfather. He’s from Ludgvan.” She compared her 
journey to “Who Do You Think You Are,” a British TV 
show in which celebrities are taken through their gene­
alogy and invariably find that their ancestors led fasci­
nating lives. But it seemed like this assumption only left 
room for the stories she wanted to hear. As Isabel spoke, 
all I could think about was how Ben Affleck refused to 
air an episode of the PBS version of the show, “Find­
ing Your Roots,” that revealed his ancestors had been 
slave owners. 


I had my doubts about the whole endeavor because I 
had gone looking for a relative’s grave before. Near the 
tail-end of a road trip a few years ago, my grandfather, 
the product of a long line of Pennsylvania Quakers, had 
taken us to an old farm in Pennsylvania to search for 
the chestnut tree where my great-grandfather’s ashes 
were scattered. We ran into a distant relative with a 
foot-long beard who accused us of trying to flatter him 
into bequeathing the farm to us. After assuring him 
we weren’t, we stumbled around in a bramble patch 
for half an hour, looking for the tree. The jaunt came 
to a suitable anti-climax when it was revealed that the 
chestnut, which he remembered had miraculously sur­
vived a blight, had died some years ago. 


Isabel’s enthusiasm about the trip, though, was infec­
tious. By the time we arrived at the Pine Grove Ceme­
tery, a small plot off a four-lane highway, I had gotten 
into the spirit of things. Isabel led us straight into the 
cemetery’s office — a quiet, green-carpeted room with 
wood vinyl walls and plaques from the Connecticut 
Crematory Association — and requested that the secre­
tary show us our ancestors’ burial records. The woman 
slowly walked to a large, messy file closet and pulled 
out a giant book and a folder. 


The Gillis’ graves were in the Old Pine Grove Ceme­
tery, a separate section of the graveyard. My mom, whom 
Isabel had shown photos of the graves, had warned me 
that our family’s section was not particularly impres­
sive. (Back at the offices, the secretary had mentioned 
that the graves were “starter level.”) The graves of John, 
my great-great grandfather, and Susan, my great-great-
grandmother, were about the size of a brick, weathered 
and partially obscured by grass. Isabel was thrilled, but I 
couldn’t see beneath the pieces of stone.


Isabel pointed to an adjacent grave. “Laura Gillis 
Williams-Hough,” she said, referring to my great-great 
aunt, who died in 1985. “Her maiden name was Gillis, 
her first husband was Williams, her second husband 
was called Hough. So she lived 1894-1985, but she’s 
buried with her first husband.” I made a joke about 
this being evidence that she preferred the first hus­
band. “Park the cynicism,” Isabel said. Dropping her 
voice, she explained that the first husband, Joseph John 
Williams, had died in 1921 in an accident in the brass 
foundry. “She lost the love of her life. The love of her 
life after three years of marriage,” Isabel said, looking 
straight at me. All I could stammer out was: “That’s 
rough. That’s bad.”


Afterwards, we took pictures of the graves (and of 
each other by the graves) and went back to the car to 
drive to the various ancestral addresses Isabel had com­
piled. This was the real adventure, the living history 
part where she could derive her ancestors’ stories from 
the spaces they used to inhabit.


I had no idea what I would say to someone who 
opened the door to us. It was just as well that the first 
address, the home that my great-grandmother Lillian 
had rented, was an empty lot, black, cracked, and scat­
tered with cigarello wrappers and an empty Big Gulp. 
Isabel seemed a bit disappointed. I tried to make up for 
photographs by the author
