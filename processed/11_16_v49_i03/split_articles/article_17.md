they don’t like to talk about security. When I asked to 
visit the access office and talk to the people who work 
there, he offered to get responses to my questions from 
the PR team instead. Those responses, when they came 
over email, were chipper but vague: “an individual’s 
card is programmed with appropriate access, based on 
their role at the university.”


Teal said it’s not ironic that the “access” people are 
so hard to access. Their job is to protect the University 
and the people associated with it, which requires pro­
tecting the information about how they do so. But such 
layers of obscurity make you wonder: If we can’t access 
the information being collected about us, then what do 
we actually have access to?


“[We] know that privacy is a thing that a lot of peo­
ple care about,” said Teal, “and unfortunately, at the 
moment, the balance between letting you know how 
things work and not letting you know how things work 
is leaning towards not letting you know how things work 
until we know it’s safe to let you know how things work.”


Still, no matter how well they guard their methods, 
Yale security is not the final arbiter of campus access—
and they know it. “We have strict controls in place for 
residential colleges but, like any access control system, 
or physical key, the system only works if people abide 
by it,” Hines wrote.


You can’t file down the tooth of a master key any­
more. But once you’re granted access to a place like 
Yale, you can get in almost anywhere, whether entry is 
doled out by four workers in an enigmatic office or by 
a student holding open the gate on Elm Street. Being 
“in,” though, also means buying in—accepting mem­
bership in this community and all that comes with it. 
When we absent-mindedly bump our pockets against 
the card readers and wait for the IDs to do their magic, 
it’s worth thinking about what, exactly, the ensuing 
green light means.
