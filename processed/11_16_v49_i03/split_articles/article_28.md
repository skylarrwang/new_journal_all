EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A cross stands in the center of Waterbury, Connecti­
cut. It’s atop Pine Hill, wedged between I-84 and Route 8, 
and inside Holy Land USA, a shuttered Catholic theme 
park. Most Saturdays and Sundays, you can find Bill 
Fitzpatrick below the cross, clearing brush from the path 
between “Jerusalem” and “Bethlehem Village,” clusters 
of biblical replicas made of plywood and stainless steel. 
Chuck Pagano, the President of Holy Land’s Board of 
Directors, will glimpse the cross as he flies out of Bradley 
Airport to catch a Packers game in Green Bay. Though 
Mayor Neil O’Leary cannot see the cross from his corner 
office in Waterbury’s City Hall, a drawing of Holy Land’s 
original layout is displayed upon a cabinet. Katerina Val­
enti eyes the cross through a window in her biology class­
room at Sacred Heart High School.

Constructed in 1956, Holy Land USA was New 
England’s first religious theme park. The attraction was 
founded by a wealthy Waterbury attorney, John Greco, 
and was composed of more than 125 religious mini-ex­
hibits. Despite the park’s initial success, the property 
aged poorly and eventually fell into a state of disrepair. 
Replicas became remains and the area turned into a 
site of vandalism. In 2010, Holy Land’s aura changed 
from deserted to tragic. A local teenager, Chloe Ott­
man, was murdered on the grounds, shocking the 
city and forcing residents to address the future of the 
abandoned park.

While fundraising efforts following Ottman’s murder 
led O’Leary and a local car dealer to purchase the land 
for $350,000, Waterbury’s healing cannot be so easily 
quantified. The small city situated in Connecticut’s 
“manufacturing valley” received national media atten­
tion for a few weeks after the murder before newspapers 
lost interest. Nowadays, Ottman’s death is a hushed sub­
ject. Her name is spoken in quiet tones, followed with 
murmurs—“It’s really too bad.” The park reopened in 
2014, but Holy Land’s period of abandonment remains 
a somber footnote in the property’s history. As one res­
ident recalled, “The bad stuff happened up there and 
then no one went.”


A locked chain link gate guards the crumbling 
entrance of the property a few hundred yards from 
the cross. An attached poster board reads “NO TRES­
PASSING. Violators will be prosecuted,” in bold red 
lettering. The neighborhood seems to listen, opting to 
observe the cross from afar. On an October afternoon, 
there’s no sign of people besides two boys pushing a 
toddler on a tricycle down the road outside the gate. 
Fifty years ago, this scene looked quite different. Older 
Waterbury residents recall Sunday picnics at Holy 
Land and races to see who could pick the most blue­
berries from the bushes on the outskirts of the property. 
But for those without these memories, it’s hard to see 
beyond the cracked asphalt driveway and the conspicu­
ous video surveillance.

Some of Holy Land’s advocates say that Ottman’s 
murder motivated them to take back the park from 
abandon. Others refuse to let the crime taint their 
memories of Holy Land. As Chuck Pagano explains, 
“I look at life myself, personally, like sailing a boat. 
You gotta jibe. You gotta tack. But you gotta keep your 
eye on the mark. And I think that’s what this group is 
focused on now: keeping our eye on the mark. But it 
was a dark episode.” 
Can the loss of a sixteen-year-old’s life be reduced to 
a single dark moment in the history of a revered place? 
Or does it change the place forever? Should it? Holy 
Land USA is both the best of Waterbury and the worst: 
a symbol of its golden age and its decline, a temple and 
a tomb. This duality still permeates the park’s identity 
today, begging the question of whether sites of trauma 
should be redeemed and transformed—or preserved 
for what they have become.

A 1950’s black-and-white photograph of John Greco 
hangs in the Holy Land chapel. He sits in a wooden 
chair with his left hand gripping his opposite wrist. His 
smile is cautious, as though he’s uncertain whether 
his portrait belongs next to the twentieth century pietà 
that looms to its right. Holy Land organizers have kept 
the portrait on display as a eulogy to the religious site’s 
founder. There’s much more to learn about Greco, 
however, from what’s outside— the remnant of his 
labor of love, Holy Land USA.

“When you were in his presence, you felt the spirit 
come through your core,” says Rebecca Calabrese, Gre­
co’s great-niece. Born in Waterbury in 1895, Greco and 
his family returned to his parents’ hometown in Avel­
lino, Italy when his father could not find work. He only 
later moved back to the States for his education at the 


Catholic University of Washington, D.C. Perpetually 
ill as an adolescent, Greco had to delay school indefi­
nitely. After finally recovering, he earned a full scholar­
ship to attend Yale Law School and stayed in Connecti­
cut for the rest of his life. His descendants say that he 
never fully shook his internal desire to become a priest. 
He founded an Italian ethnicity group and devoted his 
free time to tutoring recent Italian immigrants (“all pro-
bono” his family still boasts). He later started Catholic 
Campaigners for Christ, where he developed the idea 
to construct a Catholic theme park. By 1956, the group 
had erected a thirty-two-foot neon crucifix on Pine Hill, 
and Holy Land USA became a reality.

Sites of Christian tourism were not uncommon in 
the 1950’s, and they continue to thrive in the South 
today. Another “Holy Land USA” opened in the 1960’s 
in Del Rio, Texas. An additional park in Orlando, Flor­
ida called “The Holy Land Experience” lets visitors be 
baptized in a chlorinated pool by a John the Baptist 
impersonator. “Ark Encounter,” a $100 million recre­
ation of Noah’s ark, opened in Kentucky in July 2016. 
The ark replica is 510 feet long and houses a zoo. These 
parks differ widely in offerings, but their popularity and 
high budgets reveal the passion with which religious 
fundamentalists have sought to create religious spaces 
outside the church to inspire the faithful and, perhaps, 
attract new members to the flock.

In Waterbury, Holy Land USA succeeded at becom­
ing a community place that everyone knew, regardless 
of religion. The park was composed of religious rep­
licas, exhibits, and spaces for reflection. Park visitors 
summited the hill and passed through two archways 
labeled “Holy Land” and “Jerusalem.” From this point, 
they could observe miniature replicas of notable places 
from the Bible, including Herod’s Palace and an inn 
with a “No Vacancy” sign. The inn was large, like a 
children’s playhouse, with scrappy plastic windowing 
and a bold red door frame. Figurines of the nativity 
scene sat in a cave-like structure, blocked off by black 
metal bars. A nearby plaque on the ground read “Every 
Day Is Christmas.” Visitors could take pictures at the 
“Dignity of Marriage” exhibit, which highlighted bib­
lical evidence for the sanctity of matrimony. The nar­
rative pathway of Jesus’ life wrapped around Pine Hill 
and culminated at the glowing cross. 

A donation bucket sat at the exit of the park for fif­
ty-cent parking contributions, but most revenue came 
from the Holy Land collections that local churches 
hosted about six times each year. With an average 
of forty thousand visitors annually, Holy Land didn’t 
have much trouble staying busy or financially afloat. 
Hordes of vehicles, an average of five hundred cars and 
thirty buses each weekend, navigated the steep climb 
up Pine Hill to unload tourists at the park. For many, 
Holy Land was the humble destination of countless 
personal pilgrimages.

Chuck Pagano grew up in the Brooklyn neighbor­
hood of Waterbury next to Saint Patrick’s Church. 
Most Decembers, his parents would take him to the 
Saint Patrick’s nativity scene before bringing him up to 
Holy Land, which he says always struck him as “a nativ­
ity scene on steroids.” Linda Barone, another lifelong 
Waterbury resident, remembers from childhood the 
realism of the Holy Land exhibits. She would follow 
her family around the park, careful not to venture too 
close to the crypt replicas. After reaching the cross, her 
family would convene again and return home to watch 
Jesus Christ Superstar on Sunday nights.

Visiting the park became as ritualistic as church 
itself to many Waterbury residents. Pagano attributes 
Holy Land’s success to the universality of its message: 
peace, reflection, and acceptance. “I think Holy Land 
was a magnet.” In his opinion, regardless of people’s 
backgrounds, Waterbury residents considered the park 
a place of reflection. With its cross glowing in the 
sky from the highest point in the city, Holy Land was 
impossible to ignore, Pagano says, “And they had good 
blueberries up there too.”

John Greco died in 1986, at the age of ninety-one, 
and designated in his will that Holy Land be left to 
an order of nuns, the Religious Teachers of Filippini. 
Several nuns moved onto the property, but they weren’t 
able to handle the upkeep. Fearing liability from acci­
dental injury, the religious order officially closed the 
park soon after inheriting it. Holy Land remained 
sealed for three decades.

Keeping 17.7 acres of land sealed, of course, is a dif­
ficult task, and the nuns attempted it half-heartedly. 
In 1997, the nuns granted a troop of Boy Scouts per­
mission to renovate the Hollywood-style Holy Land 
USA sign that rests on Pine Hill above I-84. A decade 
later, in 2007, a coalition of local Catholic volunteers 
scraped together enough money to replace the crum­
bling crucifix with a fifty-foot, stainless steel cross. The 
new cross was not internally lit, making it harder to see 
at a distance. As the lights dimmed on Holy Land, the 
park sank further into disrepair.

RoadsideAmerica.com suggests skipping a visit to 
Holy Land USA if you don’t have an up-to-date tetanus 
shot. Grassy clumps peek through fissures in the side­
walk outside the chapel. Discarded plywood replicas 
of toy church steeples, held together by rusty nails, are 
strewn around the park’s entrance. The ceramic torso
