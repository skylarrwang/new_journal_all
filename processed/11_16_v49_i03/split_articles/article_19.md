it, telling her that paved-over history was still history, 
but she seemed unconvinced. She wanted the house, 
the fixed physical form.

Back in the car, we headed to East Farm Street, 
where Isabel had recorded two addresses. John Gillis 
had once rented a room at 116 East Farm, which was 
now a funeral home. In the 1920s, the whole family 
had rented 130 East Farm, which was still standing. 
The street included several empty lots and boarded up 
houses. Isabel reassured me that “if you strip back the 
years,” these houses would have been very nice, espe­
cially compared to those in Cornwall, which remains 
one of the poorest parts of England. The house itself, 
split into three units and surrounded by a waist-high 
chain link fence, was covered in chipped green and 
white paint.

Two men in a green van parked out front were 
talking to another man standing in the doorway of 
the house. Isabel went up and introduced herself to 
them, explained what we were doing, and asked the 
men if they had any memories of the area. William, a 
balding man in his sixties inside the van, said that he 
had moved there from Virginia in the sixties, and had 
grown up with the other two men.
 “This was a beautiful place in the sixties, it really 
was. A nice place to grow up,” he said. Isabel was 
pleased with this.

William suggested we take some dirt from the house as 
a souvenir. He pointed to a discarded water bottle on the 
ground that we could put it in. Despite all that has hap­
pened since the twenties, he said, “the dirt doesn’t change.”

I picked up the empty water bottle while Isabel took 
some pictures. I dug into the hard ground with my fin­
gers, and gathered the powdery gray dirt into the bottle. 
This, unlike the graves or the documents, finally felt 
like something real, a physical link to my past. 

As we drove to our last stop, Naugatuck, where my 
grandmother grew up and where Isabel would drop me 
off at the train, she told me emphatically that the Gil­
lis family was “not destitute,” that compared to Corn­
wall, the houses would have been “spacious.” It seemed 
strange to me that she insisted on this repeatedly, espe­
cially since my grandmother had told me that the Gil­
lises had lived hard lives in small apartments without 
any heating.

As we approached the final house, my great-grand­
parents’ first home in Naugatuck, Isabel seemed 
relieved. It was a fairly plain, three-story house with 
blue plastic siding. She proclaimed that this was much 
more like the type of neighborhood my ancestors grew 
up in. It was, of course, a big step up from Ludgvan. It 
fit the story she’d built through census forms and old 
photographs: that the Gillises, who persevered through 
the Great Depression, worked long but satisfying hours 
in the brass factory and were happy. 

Isabel then dropped me off at the Naugatuck train 
station. We said our goodbyes and then she drove up 
to Hartford to meet some family friends for dinner. 
Though we each promised to write each other, we still 
haven’t. As I took the Metro North train back to New 
Haven with my bottle of dirt, I wondered why spend­
ing an afternoon retracing my distant ancestors’ steps 
had not been enough to make me feel close to them. I 
wasn’t inspired by Laura’s love or saddened by Joseph’s 
short life. They were still just my mom’s mom’s mom’s 
family graves.

For Isabel, the project was more immediate. Until her 
brother had gone to look at the immigration records, 
she had had no idea where her grandfather came from. 
That discovery prompted an international journey to 
learn the story of her family — her story of herself. 
And I had agreed to meet her because I also wanted to 
craft a narrative: my “Waterbury Adventure,” in which 
I went to see my ancestors’ graves with a wacky, dis­
tant relative. Isabel’s insistence that our ancestors’ lives 
had been “nice,” of course, was just right for my story. 
But her determination to peer into the past was unde­
niably powerful. I couldn’t see what she could, but I 
wanted to. Maybe that’s why, though my ecology-liter­
ate housemate assured me that the dirt underneath 130 
East Farm Street does indeed change continuously, the 
bottle still rests on a table in my room.

I WONDERED WHY SPENDING 
AN AFTERNOON RETRACING 
MY DISTANT ANCESTORS’ 
STEPS HAD NOT BEEN 
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME FEEL 
CLOSE TO THEM.
