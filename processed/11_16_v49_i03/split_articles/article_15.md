George Malkemus and Tony Yurgaitis are not, strictly 
speaking, dairy farmers. When Tony and George aren’t 
moonlighting as the owners of Arethusa Farm Dairy of 
Litchfield, Connecticut, they are executives at Manolo 
Blahnik International Limited, the manufacturers of 
the eponymous shoe made famous by Sarah Jessica 
Parker during her run on Sex and the City. This is all 
to say that Tony and George don’t come from a lineage 
bovine; in addition to their careers as fashion execu­
tives, the men are lifelong partners. In 1999, having 
discovered that the plot of land across from their coun­
try home in Litchfield was being converted into tract 
housing, they bought all 350 acres of that abandoned 
farmland. All that trouble, just to protect their view.

The couple did a bit of research. They surfaced old 
deeds and went to the town registrar. Lo and behold, 
theirs was not just any property, but rather the site of 
a historic farm: Arethusa, named for a rare species of 
orchid that once bloomed there. On went the light 
bulb, and a second career emerged. Arethusa rose 
again. “We saved this farm,” Tony Yurgaitis tells me 
over the phone, his voice avuncular but pointed, as if 
debating with a small child. “This farm that has such 
an important history in our community.” 

They erected a barn, wide and white, and as big as 
an airport hangar. The floors are kept spotless. Over 
fifteen years, five cows became three hundred: Jerseys, 
Holsteins, and Brown Swiss. Their tails are washed, 
conditioned with Pantene Pro-V, and blow-dried daily, 
as the staff will tell you on a Saturday public tour. A 
decal reading, “Every cow in this barn is a lady, please 
treat her as such” hangs above the stalls. Yes, what 
you’re looking at has that farm sensibility about it, but 
at the same time, it’s the sort of place that makes you 
want to come back in the next life as a cow. 

About ten years after opening the farm, Tony and 
George bought the old firehouse on Route 202 in 
nearby Bantam. It became their first retail and produc­
tion outlet. Soon, they bought the general store adja­
cent to the firehouse and opened Arethusa al tavolo, a 
farm-to-table restaurant now ranked among the top 100 
restaurants in the nation by OpenTable. In 2013, the 
couple made a third purchase in Bantam, just across the 
street, when Shannon McMorrow, the proprietor of the 
Bantam Coffee Shop, decided to become a phleboto­
mist and sold Tony and George her space for $325,000. 
This spring, her styrofoam cup joint was reopened as 
Arethusa a mano, a café serving Italian-style espresso 
and light lunch fare. 

That’s the triptych of Arethusa Farm Dairy in Litch­
field County: the farm, the restaurant, the cafe. “The 
community really supports us,” Yurgaitis said. “It’s 
always great to see the lines out the door. We’ve become 
a destination not just for locals but people throughout 
the Northeast who’ve discovered our products.” 

And, to a point, members of the community agree. 
“They have a good reputation in the area, an excel­
lent reputation actually. They’re always busy,” said 
Cameron Bove, an organic farmer and librarian, who 
supplies Arethusa al tavolo with tomatoes, specialty 
cooking greens, salads, edible flowers, celery root, and 
beans. “They support a lot in the community. For exam­
ple, I know they support the [Oliver Wolcott] Library, 
they certainly support a lot of school fundraisers. The 
Girl Scouts. You see their name in a lot of places.”

Which brings us to New Haven. According to Yur­
gaitis, Arethusa had been considering expanding 
beyond Litchfield, and when Yale University Properties 
approached them and offered a prime spot on Chapel 
Street, they couldn’t turn it down. 

John and Karen Pollard, who live in Middlebury, 
Connecticut, have been doing New Haven retail leas­
ing on Yale’s behalf for about twenty years. They knew 
the Arethusa story. John explains, “Karen saw what they 
were doing and felt like it would be an excellent addi­
tion to New Haven’s offerings of great, Connecticut, 
quality products.” Connecticut-based quality is a big 
deal to the Pollards. 

It was the Chapel Street aura that appealed to Tony 
and George: the brick sidewalk, the dignified proxim­
ity to Yale, the hauteur. “As soon as I saw it, I thought 
‘This is what we’re about,’” Yurgaitis explained. To 
boot, the space was jeweler Peter Indorf’s former home. 
The clincher? The Chapel Street outlet is less than an 
hour away from Litchfield, which allows Arethusa to 
uphold its commitment to local, artisanal production, 
with goods delivered from the Bantam outlet two to 
three times a week. “It’s just not far. Plus New Haven is 
a much bigger city than Bantam, which is so seasonal, 
but in New Haven, where the population is so much 
bigger, the business is more regular.” 

The Chapel Street location is almost identical to the 
original Bantam storefront, both with respect to design 
and comestibles. But even though New Haven is close 
enough to receive regular shipments of fresh dairy, it 
feels a world away from the bucolic pastures depicted 
on the Arethusa labels. The aesthetic brings customers 
into a world where cows graze peacefully, untroubled 
by human worries. The retail locations are très white. 
White walls, white hydrangeas, white light. The walls are 
lined with black and white photos of Jersey cows. The ice 
cream flavors are listed in chalk. The floors are checker­
board linoleum. “Sterilized” comes to mind. As if dairy 
farms didn’t smell of, I don’t know, cows or manure or 
rot or any of the other pungencies you get when you bust 
out seven thousand gallons of lactation a week.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
“Going to New Haven we had to really educate our 
staff there, because people didn’t know about Arethusa 
or our story,” says Yurgaitis. “We have to be able to 
include New Haven, give them as much support as we 
give the Bantam staff.” For example, all new staff mem­
bers get to tour the farm. 

On such a tour, you see prize-winning cows, vats of 
4 percent butterfat milk, round-the-clock farm staff. 
Maybe, if you’re not an employee but rather one of 
Arethusa’s patrons, you drive to al tavolo, examine the 
ceramic dishware from Puglia, Italy. Maybe you order 
a Stumptown latte at a mano. Maybe you’re driving a 
Mercedes C-Class.

And the staff? Well, I suppose they just go back to 
New Haven, sell these pints of creamy country good­
ness. But this is merely conjecture. I couldn’t get an 
Arethusa employee to talk on the record.

—
 For the sake of owning up to my journalistic non-in­
tegrity, I’ll put it bluntly: I’m a big fan of the Arethusa 
products. Like Karen Pollard, my favorite flavor of 
Arethusa ice cream is Sweet Cream with Dark Choc­
olate Chunks. Their plain yogurt is not thick, but 
rather tangy and light in a way you wouldn’t expect. 
Who knows. I can’t write about food. The point is: The 
cheeses are great, the chocolate milk is great, and the 
ice cream, well.

But in the words of Barbara Putnam, a longtime 
Litchfield resident and food activist, however, “It’s not 
just about ice cream.” 

Here’s the trouble: there was a time, not so long 
ago, in fact a time I remember, when driving West on 
Route 202 there wasn’t a C-Class in sight. Ice cream 
in Litchfield County meant Popeye’s or Max’s or Nel­
lie’s, three scoops of blue Cookie Monster in a sugar 
cone that smelled faintly of formaldehyde. Now Ban­
tam is little more than an Arethusa strip mall. Start 
your morning with a hand-rolled salt bagel, lunch on 
lump crab and taro chip salad, maybe some seared 
veal sweetbreads, and enjoy an ice cream on your way 
out of town. 

Yes, there’s a wistful anger that comes with describ­
ing gentrification, but what I’m talking about isn’t gen­
trification in the obvious sense. Putnam acknowledged 
that Tony and George “are very engaged in the com­
munity and generous to local nonprofits who request 
their support. Every time I work at the soup kitchen, 
the fridge is full of milk that they have donated.” Lisa 
Hageman, a lifelong Litchfield County resident who 
runs this soup kitchen, says she no longer has to buy 
milk and can count on Arethusa donations “99% of 
the time.”

So let’s be clear. George and Tony—good guys. Sweet 
guys. In a way, Arethusa put Bantam on the culinary 
map. Putnam notes that the community itself looks 
upon Arethusa favorably. And, most critically, to suggest 
that Arethusa hasn’t brought bodies and capital to Litch­
field County would deny the simple facts of the matter. 

And yet, to understand the nuance of the problem 
of Arethusa Farm Dairy, a little Litchfield context is 
necessary. Tony and George are weekenders. Their 
white-paneled Neoclassical estate facing the farm was, 
before Arethusa, used for Easter and Labor Day and 
convenient weekends in between. During the work­
week, they are Manhattan residents. 

There’s a lot of that in Litchfield. Susan Saint James, 
Mia Farrow, and Anderson Cooper have all weekended 
there. Cameron Bove, the organic farmer, acknowl­
edges the weight of this fact: “[Arethusa] caters to the 
New Yorkers, the second-home community, but they 
employ a lot of people here.”

In Bantam, not so much. Though a borough under 
the governance of the town of Litchfield, Bantam has 
an identity entirely its own. It isn’t blue collar in quite 
the same way that Reading, Pennsylvania is blue col­
lar. But everything is relative, and though permanent 
Litchfield residents are not nearly as wealthy as the 
weekend population, Bantam is still a much poorer 
town. The median income for a household in Bantam 
is $32,167; in Litchfield, that amount is $58,418—just 
a few thousand above the national median. To make it 
topical: Trump dominated in Bantam and won only by 
a small margin in Litchfield. 

The drive between the Arethusa cows and the old 
firehouse where their milk products are sold takes only 
fifteen minutes. But, as Barbara Putnam notes, that dis­
tance is more symbolic than one might assume: “There 
are rich weekenders who can afford to eat in [Arethusa 
al tavolo] and buy their ice cream, and there are long­
time locals who can’t.” Putnam links this tension to the 
discussion of wealth inequality that has dominated so 
much political discourse in recent months.

EVEN THOUGH 
NEW HAVEN IS CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO RECEIVE 
REGULAR SHIPMENTS OF 
FRESH DAIRY, IT FEELS A 
WORLD AWAY.

Trish Lapidus, a senior citizen who’s lived in Ban­
tam for just four and a half years, nevertheless feels 
that something has changed. “It does seem to have 
changed,” she tells me. “Five years ago, Bantam was 
a little more down home. Things weren’t as expensive. 
Now I think Bantam—don’t get me wrong, it’s beau­
tiful, it’s wonderful—part of it is sort of rich-focused. 
There are two restaurants that no ordinary person can 
afford. Mind you, I admire those people, but it’s just 
out of my price range.”

To be fair, there’s been no overt clash between Ban­
tam and Arethusa or New Haven and Arethusa. No pro­
tests of gentrification, no boycotts by the ranks of the 
food-conscious. For now, everything remains beneath 
the surface, simmering, pasteurizing, if you’ll excuse 
the pun.  

“I mean those cows cost $400,000,” Lapidus contin­
ues. “I live on $1100 a month. It’s a different world. I 
look around and I think, that’s a different world.”

Last weekend, I went to Arethusa on Chapel and 
paid $4.50 for a huge cone of Sweet Cream. As luck 
would have it, Tony and George were there, and I went 
over and said hello. George was rearranging pints of 
ice cream. Tony was telling me how he wants to get 
the word out about the new grilled cheese sandwiches. 
Tony was wrapped in a winter coat, George had a smile 
as wide as a banana. I ask one of the employees if the 
couple often visit the store. “Once in a blue moon.”

It’s difficult to watch George rearranging those pints, 
clad in a Merino wool sweater or whatever and the cus­
tomers sampling new permutations of blue cheese or 
debating the merits between the 1% or 2% milk and 
to be reminded of Litchfield. Or New Haven, for that 
matter. The store is reminiscent of something, yes—but 
I’m not quite sure what. It is a Connecticut divorced 
from the one I grew up in. Yet still the bottles read, 
“Milk like it used to taste.”
