EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Dear readers, 

Earlier this week, Oxford Dictionaries announced that their 2016 word of 
the year is “post-truth,” “relating to or denoting circumstances in which 
objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to 
emotion and personal belief.” Its use increased some two thousand per­
cent this year. As the presidential campaign made us doubt the national 
media’s ability to communicate across partisan lines, we didn’t think much 
about our own publication. At a place like Yale, which felt immune from 
the potential of a Trump presidency, we felt immune to post-truth, too. 
After the election, when the New York Times’ election map faded to the 
opposite color than had been predicted, we didn’t. 

Our October cover story, about Yale’s Republicans and the 2016 race, was 
written with the assumption -- informed by polls and national media pre­
dictions -- that Trump would lose, precipitating an epic existential struggle 
within the GOP. We could not have foreseen the outcome on November 
8th, but we should have been more attuned to the array of possibilities 
that existed all along, and the forces in American politics which Trump’s 
campaign brought to the fore. That would have been true regardless of 
what happened on Election Day, but now it is impossible to ignore. 

Now, the shock has lessened. As we edited pieces for this issue, what 
remained were questions about how to do our jobs as writers and editors 
while considering the blind spots of publications—those in cities, with 
writers we admire and read in classes. First: What should we do right 
after, on November 9? You can find our answer on page 24, where you’ll 
find eight vignettes depicting the reactions of different groups of people 
around New Haven to Trump’s win. 

Very little of the journalism published today can accurately be called 
activism. Still, we at The New Journal are responsible for recording local 
activists’ efforts, and we have embraced our role as a platform for student 
journalists, sometimes activists themselves, to reflect on the most critical 
issues facing our city and campus. And we are responsible for being 
purposeful in our coverage of New Haven while at the same time remain­
ing self-aware about our temporary home: Yale, a university that houses 
many students who feel threatened by Trump’s proposed policies, and is 
home to relatively few people who share the opinions that triumphed on 
November 8. 

Over the next months and years, The New Journal should document the 
effects of a historic presidency on our campus and city. We should draw 
attention to injustice of all kinds and highlight those who are working 
against it. We hope you will hold us accountable for our reporting and 
writing, as well as our decisions about what to put in our pages. You can 
always email us at editors@thenewjournalatyale.com and leave comments 
on our Facebook page and website. Thank you for reading, and we hope 
to hear from you now and always. 

Sincerely, 
Isabelle Taft & Elena Saavedra Buckley, editors-in-chief
