syndrome." Yet he does not claim that 
there is any system better than democracy. 
He also admits that democracy has "other 
business" {e.g., admin~tering justice and 
defending civil rights) besides making irs 
citizens happy. Lane, however, claims that, 
"across politics at all levels of development, 
the presence of democracy ... is unrelated to 
average SWB." Lane refers to several studies 
that show that neither equality nor civil 
and political rights contribute to happi-
ness. "How can this be?" he asks. Lane 
answers that "people fight to the death to 
gain these rights, but, as with income, once 
achieved, they adapt to their good fortune. 
They take their rights for granted." 

Another cause of our unhappiness is 
the inherent pain of the democratic 
process. Democracy asks that irs citizens 
take a position on difficult social problems. 
Political participation is painful because 
thinking about social problems "may cause 
internal 
conflicts" 
and 
"quarrels." 
Furthermore, "the resolution of those quar-
rels will injure one side or another," 
"acknowledging the presence of these prob-
lems is painful," and "the implied or open 
conflict of values is painful because it hurts 
to find one's values chatlenged or scorned." 
Lane believes this unhappiness is manifest-
ed in the increasing number of Americans 
who report "community, national, and 
world problems" as sources of unhappiness. 
Between 1957 and 1976, this number 
almost doubled to 24%. But, are people 
made unhappy by the problems themselves 
or by the political discussions that ensue? I 
imagine that the Columbine shootings 
caused more unhappiness than did the 
political discussions which they precipitat-
ed. 

Voting, apparently, is also a great 
source of pain. Lane applies a cost-benefit 
analysis to voting: 
The traditional way of assessing 
the coscs or pains of participation is to 
compare the effort and time involved in 
voting with the likelihood that one's 
vorcs will make the difference between 
winning and losing and, in an extended 
comparison, the likelihood that one wiiJ 
acrually receive the policy benefits from 
winning. It is no contest. As has often 
bcc:n noted, one is more likely co be run 
over on the way to the polls than to cast 
a winning vote. Hence the rational 
choice is to stay away from the polls. 
Lane doesn't mean that we should stop 
voting; rather, he explains why most people 
dislike it. While Lane's cost-benefit analysis 
may explain low rates of voting, it does not 
further his thesis. Of the 55% of Americans 
who voted in the 1996 presidential elec-
tions, I can't imagine the action detracted 
significantly from their SWB, nor does Lane 
offer any evidence that it did. 

Lane's most puzzling and problematic 
statements deal with the "deep and often 
irreconcilable tension between the univer-
salistic principles of democracy and the 
particularistic principles of companion-
ship." Lane believes that democracy 
inhibits, if not excludes, the principles that 
guide our social relations. Democracy 
makes us unhappy because our relation ro 
other citizens is unlike our relation to our 
friends and family. Moreover, while "com -
panionship relies on the familiar and the 
similar, democracy must include strangers 
and the unfamiliar and dissimilar." Again, I 
am skeptical of this argument. While 
democracy may exclude the principles of 
companionship, Lane gives no evidence 
that it inhibits acrual friendship. I also have 
no concern for the happiness of those who 
are so disturbed by democracy's inclusion 
of the different and dissimilar. Of course, 
my own antipathy toward the intolerant 
would serve as a demonstration of Lane's 
argumem if it led to my own unhappiness. 
Bur I'm nor losing any sleep over it. 

Lane succeeds in aslcing striking ques-
tions about our political and economic sys-
tem. His market analysis effectively shows 
how money fails to contribute to happiness 
and may even contribute ro unhappiness. 
While some of his arguments read like 
common 
sense, 
sense 
is 
suenghthened by concrete proof, whiLh 
Lane offers. Unfortunately, Lane's analysis 
of democracy could use a good dollop of 
the same common sense. I've presented 
some of my objections to these argument~. 
and I'm sure readers could quickly find 
their own. But perhaps no one should 
bother to read Lane's analysis of democra-
cy. In a cost-benefit analysis of the time and 
effort it rakes to read these chapters {and 
the possibility of incurring a paper cut), 
compared with the likelihood that Lane 
will persuade, there is no contest.
