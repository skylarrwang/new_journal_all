How Joseph Heller learned to stop worrying and love the bomb 
advertising would later resurface in the bleak Something HappnmJ, 
his second novel.) While writing copy in the advertising depart-
ments of Time, Look, and finally McCall's magazines, Heller would 
squeeze in work on his novel-at night, seated at his dinner table, 
or surreptitiously at the office. In November of 1961, after eight 
uninterrupted years of writing, Catch-22 appeared to giddy reviews 
from some and harsh criticism from others. Richard Stern, who 
reviewed Catch-22 for The New York Times, said the book was "a 
collection of anecdotes, some of them finely assembled, yes," but 
"much too long," "repetitive," "monotonous," and "certainly no ,

novel." Another reviewer, 
John Pine, called Catch-u 
"tedious" and recommended 
it only for libraries with large • 
collections of fiction. 
But there was also a 
rather vocal group of readers 
who thought otherwise. The 
novelist Nelson Algren, writ-
ing in The Nation, claimed 
Heller's book was not only 
"the best American novd to 
come out of World War u" 
but also simply "the best 
American novel.. .in years." 
Amidst the salvos of critics 
favorable and not, the book 
circulated quietly for a few 
years. After the poor reviews 
and negative publicity died 
down, most readers only came to Catch-22 via word-of-mouth. 
Soon enough Yossarian would become everyone's favorite survivor, 
and Catch-22 the novel that everyone was reading. 
In telling the story of John Yossarian, a bombardier who spends 
much of the novel trying to have himself declared insane and there-
fore unable ro fly another mission, Heller drew on many of his own 
experiences in the war, but always deflected attempts to connect 
Yossarian's nihilism with his own view of life at the time. "I am not 
Yossarian," Heller once said. "He is who I might like to have been, 
had I .the knowledge then that I now have." 


It is hard to overstate the importance of Catch-22 in American 
cultural and polirical life. Before Catch-22, American war writing 
consisted of a dozen variations on a single traditional theme. In 1M 
Red Badge of Courage, A Fa~ell to Arms, and even more contem-
porary works such as The Naked and the Dead and The Thin Ret/ 
Line, the soldier's experience in war invariably takes the form of the 
bildungsroman, a story of a young person's education and arrival 
into the world. After World War I, the tales usually featured a young 
man disillusioned by his service in the war. After Heller, the sea-
soned and aged veteran replaced the inexperienced charge as pro-
tagonist. Prolonged hysteria and rampant paranoia, taken up again 
by the war films of the 1970S and '8os, became the dominant keys 
in which the stories of war were told. Most importantly, war could 
finally be funny. After Catch-22, novels such as Slaughterhouse-Five 
and Grttvityi RAinbow could be written, and films such as Dr. 
Smtn~low could be produced. 

Set during World War II and written in the 1950S, Catch-22 
missed by a decade or so the war in which Milo Minderbinder and 
Major Major Major Major might have been depicted most fitting-
ly. And yet despite its faintly anachronistic references to the 
McCarthy era, no other work of fiction inspired more students and 
young people as the antiwar movement grew or represented the 
folly of napalm diplomacy so well. By the mid-196os, draft dodgers 
began wearing Army field jackets with "Yossarian Lives" name.tags, 
and Nnusw«lt wrote about the "Heller cult." Catch-22, although 
not directly about Vietnam, became the most compemng and pop-
ular story of the war's nightmarish realities, and of our country's

duty really isn't crazy." 
Thete was only one catch and that was Cacch-22, 
which specified that a concern for one's own safety in 
the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the 
process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be 
grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he 
did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly 
more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions 
and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly 
them. If he Bcw them he was crazy and didn't have to; 
but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. 
Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute sim-
plicity of this clause of Carch-11 and let out a respectful 
wtWde. 
•That's some catch, that Catch-22," he observed. 
•Jt's the best there is," Doc Danecka agreed. 
Carm-u, as the critic Alfred Kazin observed, is a fantasy made 
real by historical events, another variable in the question of whether 
an imitates life or the other way around. In the four decades since 
its first publication, the novel has been rranslated into more than 20
