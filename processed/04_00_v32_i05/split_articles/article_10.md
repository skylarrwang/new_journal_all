It Takes 1o,ooo Villages

nonprofit organization who,c go.tl, ,1ccord-
ing to its mission statement, is "to provide 
vital, fair income to Third World people by 
selling their handicrafts and telling their 
stories in North America." 

The organization was started 53 years 
ago by a Mennonite teacher named Ruth 
Edna Byler. At first, Byler operated a one-
woman business, selling Puerto Rican 
embroidery out of her basement and the 
trunk of her car. Now, half a century 
later, 
the 
Mennonite 
Central 
Committee runs the chain, operating 
210 stores across North America, 
including local branches in New j6 
Haven, West Hartford, Cambridge, 
Northampton, Providence, Boston, 
and Princeton. In recent years, the 
rate of growth has increased with an 
average of two new stores opening 
every year, rypically run by two paid 
employees and an assortment of volun-
teers. 

The organization works with arti-
sans in 35 countries in Africa, Asia, and 
Central and South America who 
would otherwise be unemployed or 
underemployed. (Although, as Rider 
admits, they fall about nine thousand 
seven hundred villages short of their 
name's claim, give or take a few villages). 
They work in co-ops, where each member 
follows a piece to its conclusion, sometimes 
bringing it home to finish. Each co-op spe-
cializes in a craft: a Bangladeshi co-op 
makes paper from weeds and water 
hyacinths, for example, and Kenyan work-
ers carve furniture and boxes out of wood. 
Then the co-ops sell their products to Ten 
Thousand Villages and other fair trade 
organizations, for a fair price, regardless of 
whether the merchandise ultimately sells to 
a customer. 

The 
co-ops 
are 
founded 
by 
Mennonites, Roman Catholics or other 
concerned people, but are gradually taken 
over by the artisans themselves. Rider had 
just returned from a month-long trip to 
South America when I first met her, and 
she related how an Ecuadoran co-op start-
ed by an Italian priest had entirely emerged 
from dependence on him and on any reli-
gious affiliation. Rider is adamant jn her.· 
insistence that she perceived "no sense· of 
patronization or 'big brother."' It is hard to 
deny the chariry aspect of Ten Thousand 
Villages, but Rider does her best to down-
play it; she prefers to think of it as a part-
nership between the artisans and her non-
profit. In any case, it's much more along 
the lines of teaching a man to fish than 
giving him a fish. The artisans she met 
were largely autonomous, asking 
advice only about what would sell in 
North America. This kind of prac-
tical exchange about marketing 
strategies is essential to the system's 
sustainabiliry. She acknowledges that 
"one of the dangers of do-gooders, 
goody-two-shoes, is that yo• have a 
good idea, and you don't think it 
through." The thriving suc:Cess of her 
organization's stores attests that .this 
pitfall is one that the "goody-two-
shoes" at Ten Thousand Vtllages have 
avoided. 

Of all the organization's good 
ideas, one of the most integral is to 
extend their business beyond com-
merce. 
The artisans want to give 
something back to their communities, and 
they have embarked on projects such as 
trash collecting, road work and reforesta-
cion in their communities. And on the 
North American end of the business, this 
ambition is manifested on several levels. 
Rider has done radio interviews, given a 
drumming presentation to toddlers at the 
Early Learning Center on Blake Street, and 
taught fifth and seventh graders in 
Cheshire about global economics. 
She 
claims, "Any organization that wants me to 
give a presentation, I will." More impor-
tantly, this attitude of communiry extends 
to the day-to-day functioning of the enter-
prise. "You will never see a panhandler 
outside our store." Rider says-not because 
they shoo the panhandlers away but 
because the store invites them in. "They 
come in and gc 
coffee." In little ways like these, the store i
re-inventing the concept of community o:
every scale, at once locally and globally.
