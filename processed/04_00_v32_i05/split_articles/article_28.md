ROBERT LANE BEGINS HIS NEW BOOK, The Loss of
Happiness in Market Democracies, by highlighting a
central irony: market capitalism and democracy are products of a utilitarian philosophy of happiness, yet the
advancement of these systems creates an increasingly unhappy society. Despite postwar economic and social gains, studies report a
significant decline in the number of Americans who consider themselves happy, as well as a growing incidence of depression and suicide. Why are today's Americans unhappier than their parents and
grandparents? Lane, the Eugene Meyer Professor Emeritus of
Political Science at Yale University, attempts to answer his question
in this thought-provoking, if highly contestable, book.

Drawing on the fields of philosophy, biology, genetics, psychology, and economics, Lane explains his basic premise: social relations make us happiest and market economics and democracy draw
us further from those relations. As a society develops into an
advanced market democracy, he contends, there is a decline in happiness.

The statistics Lane cites regarding the decline of happiness in
America are less than staggering, but, given the economic and political advances of the past decades, any decline seems strange.
Between 1972 and 1994, the number of Americans who considered
themselves "very happy" declined by about five percent. The incidence of depression rose by a larger percentage. Lane quotes from a
study finding that, "of those Americans born before 1955, only one
percent had suffered a major depression by age 75; of those born
after 1955, six percent had become depressed by age 24 [sic]." The
study also suggested that "now about a quarter of the population
experiences some of the clinical symptoms of depression during
some portion of their lifetime."

Having established the problem, Lane attacks the market's ability to make us happy. Market economies are often justified by their
ability to maximize consumer choice to best fulfill material desires.
But do more goods make people happier? Most Americans think so.
Without giving precise statistics, Lane refers to a study that found
that "most people believe that a 25% pay increase would make them
more satisfied with their lives." And yet, those whose "incomes are
now at that higher level are not, in fact, happier or more satisfied
with their lives." Lane uses the psychological theory of the "hedonic treadmill" to explain this phenomenon: "if desires, expectations,
and standards of comparison increase as rapidly as achievements, or
at least attainments, no increase in income, no matter how large,
will increase SWB [subjective well being]." Lane argues that "in
advanced countries, above the poverty level, this relationship

between level of income and level of SWB
is weak or nonexistent. Thus, the rich are
no more satisfied with their lives than the
merely comfortable, who in turn are only
slightly, if at all, more satisfied with their lives
than the lower middle classes."

While Lane's arguments are convincing
and often perceptive, one wonders if this all isn't just common
sense. Isn't Lane using statistics and technical jargon to tell us what
our parents have told us for years: money doesn't make us happy?
Lane's analysis becomes more original in later chapters, but as he
departs from familiar ground, his reasoning breaks down.

Lane argues not only that money does not add to our happiness, but also that the pursuit of it drives us away from our friends
and family. He claims that "the cost of market efficiency, and therefore of wealth, was the sacrifice of family and friendship relations in
economic affairs." For example, employers' choice of workers is
supposedly based upon merit "uncontaminated by cronyism or
nepotism" as they pursue profit at the cost of companionship and
family. Lane may be correct to argue that we would be happier in a
job surrounded by family and friends rather than the most efficient
and productive of strangers. Perhaps we find cronyism and nepotism appalling not because they reduce profit, but because these
practices are unethical. Lane ignores this possibility as well as the
continuing prevalence of such favoritism.

Lane points to the "devaluation" of children as a cause of
unhappiness in family life. "Children have now lost much of their
value as human capital and are, instead, rather expensive consumer
goods." Lane points to the significant decline in time women spend
with their children (men report a slight increase in family time) and
the declining birthrate as evidence of this devaluation. I am skeptical of his argument. Lane only fleetingly mentions birth control's
relation to declining birthrates and fails to note the impact of feminism on domestic life. If there is a decline in the quantity of time
parents spend with their child, this does not mean there is a decline
in quality of time. And even if parents choose to have fewer children for financial reasons, this does not mean the children are less
loved or that they grow up less happily.

If market capitalism fails to make a society happy, perhaps we
should turn to the government for help. But Lane also targets
democracy as a cause of the rising tide of unhappiness in America.
In the second half of his book, Lane explains how democratic
processes are "generally painful, fail to contribute to good cheer in
democratic publics, and contribute to an unhappiness-negativity
