Skulls Give Up Their Bones 
Before he was a legacy in national politiel
George W Bush inherited a spot in an eve•
more mandarin cloister of elite powe1 
Skull and Bones. Luckily for Bush oppo
nents everywhere, this ominous fact ha
not escaped 
the ever-vigilant Gar
Trudeau, who dedicated a week a 
"Doonsbury'' in March to lampoonin 
Bones's zany attempts to grease W's path t•
the White House. 

W ith all the talk of secrecy, it may b 
fitting that Trudeau kept his own societ
involvement a secret. Rumor has it he him
self turned down a spot in Skull and Bone
in order co join Scroll and Key in 197c
This particular choice of clandestine insti
tution may make sense given Trudeau
bohemian ambitions. Keys has a smalle1
more liberal political roster than Bones; th
best Trudeau's fellows ever did in politic
was probably Dean Acheson, whose biogra

read; or possibly Sargent Shri'!'er, Kenned
spouse and father-in-law to forme
Presidential 
Fitness 
Adviser 
Arnol•
Schwarzeneggac. Bones tends to get stodg 
insiders like David Gergen; Keys tends t• 
get 
stodgy 
muckrakers 
like 
Bol 
Woodward. Given this dichotomy, mayb
Trudeau's point was not that secret societie
ace bad for American democracy, but tha
Skull and Bones in particular is bad fo 
American democracy. 

Director Rob Cohen advances a simi 
lac thesis in the film The Skulls. Lik•
Trudeau, Cohen went tO Yale, and lik•
Trudeau, Cohen's society expertise come: 
from his year in a non-Bones societ)
(which one remains a secret). And, i. 
Trudeau's characters are better drawn 
Cohen's ace yet more conspiratorial. In The 
Skulls, an improbably cast Craig T. Nelson 
(of "Coach" fame) coaches an all-whi~t
team of Yale men in the game of eli~t
power, branding them with skulls, secredy 
funneling thousands into their banlc 
accounts, setting them up with centerfold
