models, and getting them inco law school,
all to the rousing chorus of "A Skull before
any other!" Everything's going smoothly
for these elite boys until someone takes this
advice too seriously, and a non-Skull dies.
According to this view, the other societies
are just rich; the Skulls alone are truly evil.
But are Cohen and Trudeau right? Do
those of us in the non-secret world have
something to fear from the likes of
Alderman Julio Gonzalez?

If money is the measure of political
power, then it is probably worth noting
that seven out of 14 of W's Bones class-
mares have donated relatively large sums to
his campaign. And although one out of two
may not sound like great participation, the
Bones's percentage of campaign concribu-
cors is more than 50 times larger than the
national percentage. What is more, five of
the seven donated the maximum amount:
SIOOO. These were: Donald Etra, G.
Gregory Gallico, Robert McCallum Jr,
Muhammad Ahmad Saleh, and Brinkley
Thorne--lawyers, doctors, and business-
men. Britton Kolar gave $200, and
Christopher Brown, S50. We may also want
to include Victor Ashe in this group,
though he was in the Class of'67. Ashe is a
true Skull: Mayor of Kaoxville, and a long-
time friend and donor to W. (He gave
$1000.)

Despite appearances, however, the
donations probably have more to do with
friendship than with fellowship or politics;
only two people in the Bones Class of '67
have given, and no one in the Class of '66
has contributed. And although four people
in the Class of'69 have donated, their total
donation is roughly equal co the $200
Britton Kolar gave on his own. Indeed, W
has raised about as much from his Delta
Kappa Epsilon brothers (whom he really
did brand) as he has from his fellow
Bonesmen.

So, barring a genuine, underground
money-laundering operation, there doesn't
seem co be much of a Skull and Bones con-
spiracy-as if one were necessary to raise
S?O million for a Republican ofW's breed-
ing in a booming economy.
