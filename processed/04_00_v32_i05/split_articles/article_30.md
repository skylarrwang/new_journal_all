Standing outside of Linsly-Chittenden, you might be tempted to 
consult the dock face on the archway connecting Street Hall and 
the Art Gallery. T h ere, too, you would be misled; while not as 
prodigiously dishonest as Father Harkness, this child tells you nei-
ther the correct minute nor the correct hour. Saybrugians, of 
course, had their sixteen-hundred-dollar Geochron clock stolen this 
fall-but before we allow them too much sympathy, consider the 
rumor that it was never actually correctly set. 

I have read bewilderingly bad times from docks in OML and 
HGS, and I've heard that a clock in Beccon has its hands bent into 
acute angles. Harkness Tower used to be reliable; up until October 
I could still use it to tick off the minutes left in Latin through a con-
venient window in Phelps Hall. Now it has been broken for six 
months. Yale Vision, the cable channel that Yale purchased and left 
as a blank blue screen with no programming save the time. was 
never taken off daylight savings. Ironically, because no one ever 
touched it, it now does tell the right time. Not content with all of 
this, I spoke with President Levin's secretary about the Harkness 
problem in mid-November. I was told that the time would be set 
again by Spring Break, a manageable deadline that has nevertheless 
come and gone. This afternoon I've been waiting for Nina fMm 
Levin's office to call me back. I've volunteered, you see, to solve this 
problem myself. I just need a lead: whom do I call, and where in 
Yale's trackless bureaucracy are the keys for winding these cloclts? 
Nina still hasn't called. 

The alarm clock in my room is wrong as well. My roommate

me a slave co time without a clock, 
or a slave to clocks without the time. We invented both, and we 
realize that they are contrivances, but we still cower at their feet. 
Bedtime nips at our heels from breakfast, chasing us through an 
arbitrary schedule and down the to-do list of today's nonnegotiable 
deadlines. How often do we do our work instead of spending time 
with friends? How often do we play Windows solitaire instead of 
doing our work instead of spending rime with friends? 

English idiom provides us with a question: do we find tim~ or 
malt~ time? Are the 24 hours of the day a zero-sum game, or can we 
create space in our lives for the things we don't have to do by tomor-
row, out of the bits and ends of our idleness and lying on the couch? 
We are very busy here, and we aren't likely to find ourselves sponta-
neously motivated to do anything when we punch out for the day. 
But if we add another item to the list-a coffee date or another 
paper to write--we still get it all done. If we play a dub spore, or 
take an extra class, those eight hours a week do not come out of 
important time with friends or in the library, but from some 
untapped reserve. Our lives get more hectic, yet we add more action 
than we take away. 

On any given day, I'm sure that President Levin, his secretary, 
and the staff in the physical plant all have something more pressing 
to do than tend to the clocks around campus. In the meantime, 
though, we've all trudged by them so many times that our eyes 
glaze. and !-because I srubbornly won't wear a watch-am always 
late. It's as absurd as it sounds: Yale doesn't have the time to set the 
time.
