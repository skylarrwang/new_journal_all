called 'blackhead.' He got punched in the face, and rhcy all looked 
at him like h~was rhc troublemaker. We went to his teacher, and we 
were ignored." Another pause, and chen angrily: "My son did not 
want to go to school anymore." 

Walker pulled her son our of public school and enrolled him at 
Heritage Christian Academy in Wallingford, where he is now an A 
student and active in school life. "What stayed with me," his moth-
er adds, "was what would have happened ro him if I couldn't pay to 
get hlm our? What would he be today?" Walker searched for an 
educational atmosphere inspiring confidence and self-esreem rather 
than fear, and found rhat "people kept calking abour Reverend 
Smith." She soon signed onto the Nannic Helen Burroughs board 
to share her ideas and emotions productively, and ro support a 
school rhar was everything she wished her son could have had. 

Though Smith's projects have been helped greatly by his 
church, Smith's church has been helped in turn by public awareness 
of the projects it takes on, the Burroughs School in particular. "I 
was pleased by the idea of an Afrocentric Christian school," Moore 
said, "especially after watching the number of children who fail 
because they have no sense of self. Children need to be engaged, to 
learn through exploration and rake control of their own education. 
They need to get a feeling of power to learn on their own rerms, and 
it has to begin while they arc young, in kindergarten or first grade." 
He believes that, as a new school whose curriculum and policies are 
being designed to meet the demands of modern society. the 
Burroughs School will prepare srudencs for the real world, both cul-
turally and academically. 

Smith also stresses the importance of reaching srudenrs history 
in a meaningful way. He criticizes the tendency of public schools to 
teach only pose-slavery African history, which, according to Smith, 
results in a shallow awareness of true African culture. \XIalker was 
even more distressed, saying char, "Our history in many ways has 
been virtually erased ... for us, ir's like, 'Marrin Luther King,' and 
that's it." 

Although applications arc still being sc.:nr our ro pre-schools 
and parents, the Nannie Helen Burroughs School already has irs 
first matriculating studenc: Jeremiah Smtrh. the kindergarten-age 
son of Reverend Smith himself. "His ID number will be 't.'" "I he 
elder Smith beams, then adds, "And we're paying tuition, too." 

The school's tuition will be on a sliding scale, based on a per-
centage of household income, in keeping with the board's de~ire 
APRIL 14, 2000 
that Burroughs be open to all, regardless of class or race. Despite irs 
Afrocentric focus, the school will nor consider race in admissions, 
which Smith claims will be strictly first-come, first-serve, until the 
20 spaces in each class are filled. 

Walker hopes that the School's focus on learning, culture, and 
the community will create a reputation that will offer Burroughs 
students attractive options upon graduation. "I have worked at 
Choate Rosemary Hall for 10 years," she says, "and they are very 
interested in a school like Nannie Helen Burroughs." Walker 
believes chat once it reaches full capacity in 2007, Burroughs could 
be a strong feeder co prep schools like Choate. She added that pres-
tigious academies are "open ro anyone with the right skills," and 
that, with Burroughs' focus on academics and the community, its 
students will be well prepared for whichever high school they 
choose ro attend. 

The Burroughs School logo is a dove perched in a band-a ref-
erence ro Noah's return ro dry land and a symbol of a new begin-
ning. And Moore is emphatic that American religion needs a new 
beginning ... With shootings every two seconds and drug deals on 
every corner, what's the church for?" he asks, then answers the ques-
tion himself: "Prayer by itself is nor enough; you need to puc action 
behind it. That's how prayers get answered. He doesn't focus just 
on the afterlife," Moore says of Smith. "His focus is on now, on 
building the community." 

Above the doors ro the main sanctuary of Community Baptist 
hangs a sign char reads, "Enter to Worship, Exit to Serve.~ Though 
Smith didn't author the phrase, he makes sure it is carried out. He 
"vill soon be absorbed in building homes and credit unions, but the 
spark to his work is the School, which will produce a base of young 
community members who are secure in their belief and their cui-
ture.
