he was far from moving into the main~ 
scream. Initially, he would not cake more 
than three dollars an hour-
the mean per 
capita global wage-for his work, even 
when employers offered him nine or ten. "I 
wouldn't accept more than that because I 
tho~ght that's what everyone should 
make," he explains. 

Corr also became active in movements 
fighting for the rights of squatters to occu~ 
py unused land regardless of who holds the 
deed. In the midst of other squatters, he 
organized and participated in countless 
occupations of land and buildings. He 
takes out a photo album and shows me pic~ 
rures of occupations and rallies. Alongside 
homeless Vietnam veterans and wild~haired 
punks. Corr wields a crowbar, shattering 
deadbolts and masrerlocks to enter aban~ 
cloned buildings. He describes an effort in 
San Francisco to block the descrucrion of 
an abandoned building used by squatters. 
He speaks slowly and deliberately, choosing 
his words carefully so as not to reveal his 
role--or whether he even had a role--in 
the illegal enterprise. A 55-gallon barrel was 
filled with chunks of stone and concrete 
and clUck strips of iron rebar. After wet 
cement was poured in, the idea went, 
squarten and aCtivists would bolt their 
hands into the barrel. In order to move 
them from the site, cops would have to cut 
through hundreds of pounds of concrete, 
rock and metal. The building was saved. 

Even as Corr describes how he ended 
up at Yale, I cannot help but feel that his 
current life is somehow disjointed from his 
radical activist days. I do not want to 
believe that he has sold out, but I can't rec· 
oncile the paradox his story seems to 
embody: the guy with a radical commit· 
ment to change and personal direct action 
transforms himself easily into the faithful 
and diligent academic. After spending 
three semesters at community college in 
San Francisco, he transferred to Yale cltis 
~. largely because of a desire to study wid! 
certain members of the political science 
department. One of those professors, James 
Scott, praises Corr, his student, on dle 
jacket of No Trnpassing. Corr is currendr 
focusing his studies on issues of global gov-
ernance, the theory propounded by left· 
wing "world federalist" organizations 
around the country. He hopes to graduate 
next year with both bachelor's and master's 
degrees in political science and then to go 
to either Law or graduate school. 

Corr picks up on my suspicion that he 
has sold out. "Stieet activism has a mot21 
power that nothing else does. It's saying 
THE NEW jouRNAL 


'we're not going to play the little game, that 
it's all bullshit,'" he says. Corr, however, 
sees no need to defend hi~ decisions; he 
calmly explains them. <.onlidcnr chat hi!. 
reasoning will speak for itself: He does not 
dismiss rhe srreer-lcvel 
l,tdidtl i~m of his 
younger da)·s as angst-ridden, adolescenr 
rebellion. Instead, he attributes his radical 
change in .tpproach to acquired wisdom 
and a recendy-developed political sensibili-
ty. "I saw the limitations th.n ~ocial move-
ments can come up agaimt," he explains. 
"Rad icals need to try to get into places 
where they can affec:c ch.11ge on a macro-
level." More than anyone, Corr seems to be 
in a position to make this judgement. 
\X'hile his radicalism has not subsided, he 
sees 
power-trad i tion;tl, 
hierarchical, 
establishment power 
as the most viable 
avenue ro legirimatt. change. "I thought 
that to be part of that hierarchy you had ro 
compromise yourself. hut if you can get let 
into that hierarchy. you have a much bener 
chance of making changes: you'll be at the 
table instead of ourside with a banner." 

Anders Corr is toeing the fine line chat 
every activist must tread. After ,1 decade of 
street activism, he is poised to emcr a main-
stream that seems to contr.tdict the radical-
ism of his younger dap. Cort thinks he can 
resolve this paradox and doC"sn't c.·ue if oth-
ers suspect that he has bcc.:n compromised. 
"All of my activist friends 1hink J'm a sell-
out, and tt\ okay with 111(.'," He returns to 
Emcr~on's "Self-Reliance," the bible of hi~ 
youth: "Io be gre-at is w be misunder-
stood."
