**Who Owns a Professor's Lecture?**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

lished that academic lectures generally were 
copyrightable under the 1909 Copyright 
Act, the actual owner of the copyright 
remained in question. 

Matters were muddled even further 
with the Federal Copyright Act of 1976. 
The Act made one crucial change: there is 
no longer any implication that teachers are 
exempt from the works-for-hire clause. 
Still, the relationship between the 1909 Act 
and the 1976 Act is unclear. If the second 
was intended to replace the first, then any 
implications for professors from the first 
Act are annulled. But if the second Act was 
intended to revise the first, replacing only 
certain portions, then the implications 
remain relevant, as does common law tra-
dition regarding copyrights. 

Under the works-for-hire clause, lec-
tures may belong to the university. After 
all, they are created on university time as 
part of a university employee's job. In fact, 
. Yale policy claims ownership of all copy-
rightable works of intellectual property cre-
ated by its employees. In order to encour-
age scholarship, it waives these rights for 
certain materials, such as books and arti-
cles. No specific mention, however, is made 
of lectures. According to Robinson, the 
University would grant most lecture copy-
rights to professors. "Yes, the University is 
involved and interested [in lectures], and 
yes, [lectures] may in a technical sense be 
works-for-hire under the copyright law, but 
there's a recognition of the critical role 
played by the faculty member ... If it is a 
work-for-hire, it is licensed back; there's an 
implicit license back to the faculty member 
of rights to further develop and exploit that 
content consistent with the interests of the 
University." Other University officials dis-
agree: "It is well understood that the lec-
tures, if they were to be copyrightable, 
would be treated as if they were the prop-
erty of the University," says Dr. E. Jonathan 
Soderstrom, Managing Director of the Yale 
University Office of Cooperative Research 
(OCR). 

The walls of OCR are covered by 
posters describing various business proce-
dures, publications trumpeting the latest 
discoveries of the Yale faculty, framed sto-
ries of Yale research successes {such as the 
drugs Zerit and Lymerix), and charts show-
ing the drastic increase over the last four 
years in profits earned from Yale patents. In 
a comer of the waiting room hangs a poster 
charting the "Patent's Progress," an appro-
priate decoration for a place that attempts 
to unite scholarship with business. This 
office, after all, manages the business side 
of all of Yale's intellectual property. 

According to the office's website, "The 
duties of the OCR include oversight for 
patenting and licensing activity, University 
inventions, and contractual relationships 
between 
faculty 
and 
industry." 
Additionally, the office attempts to develop 
new connections with industry by identify-
ing inventions with commercial applica-
, tions and by helping to create new private 
companies to market applications of Yale 
research. 

Yale has the right to an area of intel-
lectual property much more profitable than 
copyrights: patents. Yale owns patents on 
all inventions created out of work done at 
Yale. This non-waived right has proved 
quite lucrative for the University, bringing 
in $4o,ooo,ooo during fiscal year 1999路 
This is largely due to the $33,ooo,ooo 
earned by Zerit, a popular AIDS drug that 
the University has licensed to Bristol-Myers 
Squibb. In addition, SmithKline Beecham 
has received FDA approval for Yale-devel-
oped Lyrnerix, the first vaccine available for 
Lyme disease. 

One might wonder why the University 
makes $4o,ooo,ooo off patents from 
research done by professors. The answer is 
the works-for-hire clause. Because the 
research that creates these patents is done 
with Yale resources, on paid Yale rime, the 
University is able to claim ownership of 
these patents, and, unlike its policy regard-
ing books and articles, chooses not to 
renounce this ownership. "The investment 
in patenting and exploiting inventions is 
sometimes very great," Robinson said. "It's 
only been through the resources of the 
Universiry that inventions have been 
patented and are marketed and licensed 
and sold. That whole activity involves an 
investment of resources on the institution-
al side quite apart from 'the investment of 
resources in the laboratory setups and the 
surrounding support that is part of the 
environment that makes possible the kinds 
of inventions that are done on the scientific 
research side." Copyrightable material, on 
the other hand, does not usually incur the 
same expenses and seldom generates such 
large royalties.

Although the University grants a blanket

Soderstrom seems not to worry that

works, it has yet to extend this policy to 
scholarship at Yale. "Yale ... was viewed as

Ironically, Yale itself has taken the ini-
tiative in introducing certain commercial 
influences, most notably drug licensing, 
into professors' research. Although Yale has 
worked to ensure academic integrity, it has 
also instituted practices that identify, 
encourage, and develop commercially-
viable research. The $4o,ooo,ooo that Yale 
made on patents last year is nearly enough 
to pay for the salaries -of every full, associ-
ate, and assistant professor in the Faculty of 
Arts and Sciences. The addition of the 
profit motive, especially when dealing with 
such large sums of money, is enough to 
influence even the most well-intentioned 
administrator or professor to research for 
commercial rather than academic reasons. 
Professors may choose to pursue drugs that 
will be successful in the United States mar-
ketplace, like Viagra or Rogaine, rather 
than unprofitable drugs like vaccines for 
epidemic third-world diseases. 

So far, Yale has been vigilant in 
defending the institution against overt 
commercialization of research and teach-
ing, as well as the attendant consequences. 
Compared to its peer institutions, the 
University is generous with professors 
when dealing with intellectual property 
and has avoided many of the pitfalls of 
commercial influence. Still, Yale must be 
careful not to take any further steps along 
the primrose path of commercial success at 
the expense of academic integrity. The 
institution has already begun to examine 
scientific research through the lens of 
profit. The Versity situation reminds us 
that the temptation for academic trespass 
can arise in all fields, be they scientific, 
humanistic, or pedagogical.
