**Yale's Ethnic Counselorship Program: A Flawed System?**
**Author: Not specified**
**Page number(s): 21**

YALE'S ETHNIC COUNSELORSHIP PROGRAM has always 
tried to help minority students make not only a change 
of address but also a major cultural leap upon their arrival in 
New Haven. "I think there's a dominant culture here at 
Yale," explains Roopa Purushothaman. "There's double-
consciousness. White students have the luxury of not 
knowing anything about me if they don't want to. But as a 
minority, I don't have that choice. I have to know both 
worlds." 

Purushothaman speaks with the conviction of a 
devoted leader, a strident activist, and an intimate friend. 
As one of only 13 ethnic counselors in Yale College, she 
assumes all three roles on a daily basis. For 
Purushothaman, who is Indian, a strong personal com-
mitment to diversity and her desire to ease the transition 
to college for Yale's minority freshmen motivate her to 
continue her efforts. She believes, however, that "the 
system is currently very flawed." 

Unlike a Yale freshman, the University's ethnic 
counselorship program cannot chalk up its current 
problems to transition difficulties. In fact, the pro-
gram is now almost 30 years old. In the early 1970s, 
Yale had only recently begun taking measures to 
accommodate many of the calls for reform that were 
then circulating. Along with many of its Ivy League 
peers, Yale first admitted women in the late 1960s 
and soon began recruiting more racial minorities. 
With activists such as Betty Friedan and Martin 
Luther King, Jr. preaching the gospel of equality, 
the message was clear: Yale must change its out-of-
date admissions practices or be left behind. Yale, 
to its credit, chose to change, and formed the eth-
nic counselorship program in 1972. 

Unfortunately, the early hope expressed for 
the program has been wearing thin. As new 
freshmen arrive on campus each September, 
new problems seem to surface. Supporters of the pro-
gram admit that it is too small to be effective, 
while antagonists claim that ethnic counselors 
foster the very divisiveness they seek to heal by 
singling out minorities for special attention. 

For instance, Aaron Honn wrote in the 
February 2, 1996, edition of the Yale Daily 
News that, "from racially exclusive fraternities 
and sororities to Yale's ethnic counselor pro-
gram, the emphasis seems to be on the 
maintenance of one's ethnic identity 
above all else ... Yale needs to get over 
race. It's not that big a deal." In response, 
the Black Student Union shot back only 
two days later, saying that "ignoring real-
ity hardly seems an appropriate, final 
word of advice ... We can't 'get over'
