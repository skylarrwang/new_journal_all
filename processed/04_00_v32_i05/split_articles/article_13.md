**Title: Who holds the deeds to Yale's intellectual property?**
**Author: Judy Miller and Patrick Casey Pitts**

"There is a consensus that
Versity.com's actions are a deeply
troubling commercial intrusion into
our classrooms, an improper exploita-
tion of the intellectual property of the
instructors, and in many instances a
misrepresentation of courses."
- Richard Brodhead, Dean of Yale College

" Under the Copyright Law, the
copyright to a work created by a
person in the course of his or her
employment belongs to the employer
rather than to the individual creator.
The law provides, therefore, that
works created by faculty members in
the course of their teaching and
research, and works created by staff
members in the course of their jobs,
are the property of the University."

A s THEY WALKED PAST the "No Food or
~
Drinks" signs into the An Gallery Lecture
Hall, carrying notebooks, snacks, and coffee one
chilly February morning, students in Professor
John
Merriman's
"European
Civilization:
1648-1945" course were surprised to find another
student standing outside the room, handing out
sheets of paper. Even more surprising, these
papers contained notes from the previous
Monday's lecture. Versity.com, an online note-
providing agency, was using student employees to
drum up business for its website. By the end of
February, Versity was providing notes for 37 Yale
classes, and this same scene had been staged out-
side five of Yale College's largest lecture courses.
The site carried notes for some of Yale's best-
known classes, including Jonathan Spence's
kHistory of Modern China" and Willie Strong's
'']au: America's Music."

Versity grew from the effons of four
University of Michigan students to provide notes
for their classes. The site expanded quickly and
soon became one of a number of online "academ-
ic communities" offering services such as class
notes, discussion boards, and campus news. The
company first anempted to enter the fabric of Eli
society last December by contacting Dean
Brodhead's office. When the Administration
failed to reply, Versity started recruiting students
as note-takers. Approximately 100 students
applied and 24 were chosen for the job, many tak-
ing notes for more than one class. Toward the end
of February, Versity reported that up to 17o/o of
Yale students were accessing the site.

Shortly after the site went up, many of Yale's
professors learned about Versity. "One of my TAS
happened to browse into [the site]," Spence said.
uMy reaction was to be puzz.led because I'd never
been asked in any way to do this [post lecture
nores on the Internet)." After considering the
subject, Spence decided he didn't approve. Other
professors agreed. "They're interjecting them-
selves in an area where they don't belong,"
Merriman said ofVersity and its student employ-
ees. Concerns ranged from quescions of accuracy
and infringement of intellectual propeny rights
to simple lecture anendance by students.

Yale is by no means the only member of the
THE NEW JouRNAL


Yale's intellectual property?

Ivy League that has had to deal with Versity. The site has featured
classes from Harvard, Columbia, and Penn, among others, and still
includes 45 courses for Penn, 37 for Cornell, and 20 for Columbia.
Stanford courses are featured on the site as well, but, after an objec-
tion from the administration regarding unlimited access to the site,
Versity agreed to allow only Stanford students access. Enterprising
students must now choose "Stanford" from a list of schools when
registering in order to view Stanford's notes. Harvard cook a more
active approach to the problem. The adminstration threatened the
rebellious scribblers with expulsion, since their actions were in vio-
lation of the student handbook: "Students who sell lecture or read-
ing notes ... may be required co withdraw."

Yale's administration became aware of Versity's presence on
campus when a number of professors complained to Dorothy
Robinson, General Counsel for the University. "I had not heard of
Versity.com until I began to receive some email correspondences
that were forwarded copies of messages by faculty members express-
ing their upset and outrage over discovering that notes from their
classes were posted on Versity.com's website ... My initial reaction
was surprise that this activity would be happening without autho-
rization," she said. The University took action. Brodhead sent an
email to all Yale students arguing that Versity's service was both a
commercial intrusion into the classroom and an exploitation of
intellectual property. Brodhead also claimed that Versity's services
"are not only wrongful, bur also often misleading and academically
unsound." Following Harvard's lead, Brodhead referred co the
Untkrgraduau Regulations, which, he claimed, prohibits students
from selling notes. Unfortunately for Yale, the clause in Yale's stu-
dent handbook is not nearly as strong as Harvard's; Yale's merely
states that studen ts may not "undertake to represent any commer-
cial interest or to operate any business on the campus without
securing prior permission from the Dean of Student Affairs."

More important than Brodhead's warning to students was his
attack on Versity icselÂ£ The University threatened to take legal
action against the company if it continued to post notes from Yale
classes. "We thought that it was important first of all because things
happen quickly on the web and because of the degree of concern
expressed by faculty members," Robinson said. "Versity had under-
taken this activity without permission and faculty felt exposed and
felt exploited, and they also felt that their courses were being mis-
represented as to content." T he same day that Brodhead wrote to
the student body, Versity agreed to remove temporarily all notes for
Yale classes-at least until it met with the Yale administration.

Monday, March 27, marked the end ofVersity's life at Yale for
the indefinite future. After meeting with administrators, Versity
agreed to keep Yale courses off its website. In exchange, the
University agreed to contact Versity if they desired its services at a
Iacer dace. While Robinson doesn't think this renewed conract is
impossible, she does think it is extremely unlikely: "The service
that's co be provided, that of note-taking. is something that can be
accomplished in other ways."

The real question, then, is why Versity agreed to such an
obviously lopsided agreement. Yale got everything it wanted,
and Versity got nothing. Versity provided no explicit rea-
son. Robinson thought that "Versity appreciates that it's
in the company's best interest not to have adversarial
relations with colleges and universities but to sell its ser-
vices and its packages co institutions that want
them ... They have a business that they wish to build
and they're learning how. They were up front with us
that they're trying co learn, they're trying to do new
things and they're trying to learn from their mis-
takes." But Versity's rune was very different earli-
er in the semester. In an interview at that time
with the Yak Daily Nnus, Ken Dignam, one of
Versity's regional managers, was confidenr of
Versity's position with regard to the law.

"Intellectual property rights do not exist.
Someone taught the professors the material
they're lecturing on; are they going to send their
old professors a part of their pay check each year?"

But while Dignam and, by extension, Versity,
have claimed that intellectual property rights do
not legally exist, this is simply false. The
United States and other countries around
the world have a long history of granting
rights to intellectual property. The
Copyright Act of 1909 was the first
codification of United States copy-
right law. It became possible to
copyright any original work in fixed
form. The law also contained rwo impor-
tant points regarding academic lectures. F1CSt,
it included "lectures, sermons, [and] address-
es" in its list of copyrightable materials.
Second, the Act declared that works-for-hire
(works created using company resources or
while being paid to create said works) are the
property of the employer, and not che employ-
ee. It appeared, however, co exclude reachers from
the works-for-hire clause.

The confusion, however, still lies in copyright
ownership. The 1969 case Wil/i4ms v.
~isur
involved a ucu. professor seeking an injunction and
damages against a company similar to Versicy for pub-
lishing notes from his class. While the case 6cmly estab-
