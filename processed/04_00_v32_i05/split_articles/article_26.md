explained. "[At Metro Taxi] drivers are our customers, not our 
employees. The driver doesn't have to use our computer dispatch 
system. He doesn't even have to do a job. Once they pay us, they 
could park the car in a driveway all day, it doesn't matter. I didn't 
write the union laws. Period. End of story. What they are trying to 
do is not allowable by law." 

I met with Scalzi the morning of the protest in his office at 
Metro Taxi headquarters. It is a small, unassuming building with 
fading letters on the exterior. A trailer connected on its left side is 
home to Scalzi's office, a cozy room furnished with a desk and chair, 
two leather chairs for meetings, a large computer, and dozens of 
photographs of his children. He thanked an employee who brought 
him a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee, which he proceeded to mix 
with a pen. "Old habit," he winked. 

For all his informality, however, the success of Metro Taxi has 
proven Bill Scalzi an excellent businessman. He began the compa-
ny in 1987, when public transportation, he said, "was pretty pathet-
ic." He bought operating rights for 109 taxis from a company that 
was going out of business and began with 15 cabs, gradually increas-
ing numbers as demand, and his revenue, grew. Now, he operates all 
109 cabs and claims that there is unmet demand for more. "Up until 
this past winter, there were no complaints [that our cabs weren't 
arriving when people requested them]. This past winter, there 
were 
defused with complaints. We didn't have enough vehicles 
on 
the road." In a move that he said will hopefully lower waiting time 
for cabs, Scalzi has applied to the State Department of 
Transportation for a certificate to operate 30 more vehicles. The 
Department 
will hold a hearing to determine whether there is a 
need for more taxis in New Haven, and will decide whether to 
grant Scalzi his request by April 27. 

In the meantime, Scalzi said he has tried to improve service by 
increasing the efficiency of his company and the quality of his cabs. 
He has added a fleet of new cabs and a state of the art computer sys-
tem, which has cut down response time from an average of over 15 
minutes to 8.2. Metro Taxi will also break ground this summer on 
a new facility that will allow for more dispatchers and computer 
space. 

Such improvements, he said, require more capital, which 
Metro Taxi can only raise by increasing the weekly lease that taxi 
drivers pay. He added that cab drivers were compensated for this 
lease increase by the Transportation Department's raised meter 
rate--a change that Scalzi himself had petitioned for--that went 
into effect on March 5. "That's why we raised lease rates when we 
did," he explained. In fact, Scalzi argued that the new meter rates 
more than compensate for the higher lease payments. According to 
Scalzi, the new lease rates channel one-third of the increased 
revenue of the new meter rates to the company while allowing drivers 
to keep two-thirds of the profit. "Drivers make more than they did 
before with the increased meter and lease rates," he asserted. 

Additionally, Scalzi's temporary compensation for increased 
prices was meant to show drivers that he is in touch with their 
needs. "The only reason that there is such a hubbub right now over 
raised rates is that they came at the same time as gasoline prices 
increased," he argued. "But the drivers are our consumers, and we want 
[to create] a work environment for them that makes them want 
[to lease from us]."

dent contractors. The UAW helped both 
groups hold rallies and parades similar to 
the one Metro Taxi workers recently held. 
Ted Feng, a UAW representative who 
attended the March 31 protest, said he is 
optimistic about the possibility of a Metro 
Taxi drivers' union. "We've got a big problem 
here. Any policy the cab owner puts 
into place is imposed upon cab drivers, not 
negotiated." In fact, Feng and Donna 
Becotte, an international representative in 
organizing for the UAW, feel that New 
Haven Metro Taxi drivers' claim to 
employee status is a strong one, perhaps 
even stronger than that of the drivers in 
Stamford and Darien. "These guys might 
lease cars, but [Scalzi] controls most of 
their work lives," she asserted. "He determines 
how much money they have to pay 
to lease the car, what insurance they get 
and how much they pay for it. Anything 
that deals with their work lives has to go 
through him." 

The case may not be as clear-cut as the 
UAW makes it seem. Scalzi argued that, 
while he does not face great competition 
from other cab companies, he does from 
other lines of work. "Driving a cab isn't the 
only industry in the world. It's competitive 
with any other job. We don't stay in the 
business by treating [our drivers] badly," he 
points out. Even if drivers are set on driving 
a cab, it is not uncommon for them to seek 
leases with companies in other cities. 
"Guys from Portland and Bridgeport drive 
for me. If they're not happy, [drivers] can 
go up to Hartford, Waterbury, 
or Bridgeport." 

Moreover, other cab 
companies 
complain 
that job applicants are 
few and inexperienced, 
weakening Metro dri-
vers' claims that they have no 
other options. Doug Vine, 
owner of New Haven Yellow 
Cab, told me that Metro Taxi 
attracts 
better 
drivers. 
"[Scalzi] is going through 
hundreds and hundreds of 
drivers, and we end up with the people he 
doesn't want." New Haven Yellow Cab's 
owner-operator leases may be over $100 
cheaper than Scalzi's now, but he said that 
he is considering raising these leases to $425 
or $450 a week, only $40 to $70 cheaper. 

Scalzi's higher prices may also be offset by 
services that other New Haven cab compa-
nies do not offer. As cabdriver Tahseen 
Kazmi grudgingly admitted, the computer

dispatch service, unique to Metro Taxi in 
New Haven, has increased revenue for dri-
vers. 

Scalzi disputes the claim that his leases 
force drivers to work unreasonable hours. 
"[Weekly drivers are] charged for six days, 
we don't expect them to work for seven 
days. The seventh day is yours: if you want 
to drive, you can," he said. "I have some 
drivers who only work five and a half days 
a week." However, many drivers complain 
that he does not credit them for the time 
spent waiting at the company's garage for 
tune-ups. Scalzi claims that downtime is 
minimal. "Drivers have to come in once 
every two and a half to three weeks for ser-
vicing that lasts 45 minutes to three hours," 
he explained. Since he feels that they 
receive a free day of revenue each week, 
Scalzi believes that drivers are more than 
compensated for this small amount of 
time. He added that if cars need more 
work, he readily loans drivers a car if one is 
available. "We don't have enough cars on 
the road, so the spare cars we have available 
dwindle to almost nothing. That is not the 
fault of Metro Taxi. We've applied for more 
cabs and hopefully the Department of 
Transportation will see clear to granting 
our request." 

Scalzi pointed out that not all Metro 
Taxi drivers are pressing to unionize. He 
leases cabs to over 100 drivers, so the 
involvement of 60 in rallies is perhaps not 
all that daunting. "Go out to the train sta-
tion and you'll see 30 cars working," he 
said. "Most [drivers] are not interested in 
union talks." But in contrast to the eager-
ness that protesters expressed in speaking to 
me, not a single driver who has not joined 
the organizers would allow me to reveal his 
name for this article. One told me he 
thought Scalzi a fair businessman, but that 
he did not want to go on the record as say-
ing so, for fear of being ostracized by his 
peers. Another told me he would join the 
union, but he believes Metro Taxi drivers 
do not have a shot at obtaining the rights 
to organize. 

Moreover, the drivers have few outside 
supporters. Robert Cumpstone, manager 
of Motor Transport Services at the 
Department of Transportation, said that he 
has received numerous phone calls from 
the spokesmen for the Metro Taxi organiz-
ers, but must tell them he has no jurisdic-
tion over their concerns. "I sit as a neutral 
party. The driver will certainly be given the 
courtesy of [my] listening--and then I 
explain the rules, regulations and statutes 
that prohibit our department from inter-
vening." Cumpstone said that he refers 
callers to the Department of Labor, which 
might be better equipped to address their 
concerns. 

While Scalzi has argued that indepen-
dent contractors are "customers" of the taxi 
company, 
the 
of 
Transportation does not treat them as such. 
If, 
as 
Cumpstone 
explained, 
this 
Department does not seek to regulate lease 
rates because its role is to serve the public, 
then taxi drivers are not considered among 
the customers that it protects. As indepen-
dent contractors, taxi drivers are apparent-
ly neither customers nor employees, but 
occupy a nebulous middle ground. 

The dispute between Bill Scalzi and 
some of his Metro Taxi drivers is less a story 
of heroes and villains than of one business-
man who needs clearer rulebooks. Scalzi's 
voice rose indignantly on the phone when 
I called for his response to some of his dri-
vers' accusations. "Those insinuations are 
like fingernails on blackboards to me," he 
said. "I wouldn't have been able to grow 
from 15 cabs to 109 by treating my cab dri-
vers poorly. I challenge any driver out of 
the present or past to show me somebody 
who's gotten a bad deal. It hasn't hap-
pened." In the case of the Metro Taxi dri-
vers, it all depends on whose story you 
believe.
