Often, this rhetoric only serves to 
osuacize Yale's minorities. "I remember 
when I arrived at Yale, the first publication 
I saw was Light and Truth,'' recalls Vindia 
Fernandez. "They had this cartoon that 
portrayed ethnic minorities with stylized 
facial features that was very stereotypical 
and prejudicial. My first reaction was, Oh 
my God ... I didn't realize I could be per-
ceived as a threat to other people. I was 
really affected by it." She continues, "Yale is 
a very different place from where I grew up.

them out for special attention.

the assignments: Korean-Americans to a 
Chinese-American counselor, Mexican-

Rican. 
Purushothaman says, "I have tons of Asian-
American counselees but only two South 
Asian kids. East Asia and South Asia are 
two totally different cultures. That's a big 
issue that isn't being examined."

encourage greater con-
tact between counselors and counselees. 
Currently, the approximately 400 ethnic 
minority freshman are divided among the 
13 ethnic counselors, so each counselor is 
assigned anywhere from 40 to 70 students, 
compared to about 20 students per fresh-
man counselor. "The point of being a 
counselor is tO be a net," Purushothaman 
points out, "But with so many students to 
look afrer, sometimes it's hard." 
Another proposed solution is to do 
away with ethnic counselor assignments 
altogether. Purushothaman herself thinks 
chat this is a viable plan. "I fed like assign-
ing is outdated. Maybe giving incoming 
freshmen more of a choice in choosing a 
counselor would be a good change." 
Students who indicate their starus as a 
minority on their initial Yale application 
are automatically assigned to an ethnic 
counselor when they come to Yale. Instead 
of this system, Purushothaman and others 
suggest that ethnic counselors could 
become 'ethnic liaisons' and simply make 
themselves available to anyone who wants 
to seek them out. "That way," says 
Purushorhaman, "students who aren't 
minorities could link to minority commu-
nities if they wanted to." This change 
might satisfy critics who contend that the 
program seals minorities off from the Yale 
black." Despite the enormous changes in 
Yale's recruiting and admissions policies 
since the late 196os, a mere seven percent of 
the student body University-wide is 
African-American. In comparison, African-
Americans make up about 13% of the gen-
eral U.S. population. 
Walker, however, feels that racial ten-
sion at Yale is created not only by the 
majority, but often arises from within the 
minority community. She recalls the Black 
Solidarity Conference that she attended 
earlier this year, where "there was so much 
angry poetry," she states. "It was weird. 
They had covered up all the portraits of the 
old white men in the Silliman dining hall 
with black doth so that they wouldn't have 
to look at them. The mood was just very 
angry and violent, which I disapprove oC 
Maritza Baez, a student of Puerto Rican 
descent, agrees that no one group is solely 
responsible for racial tensions at Yale. "I 
belong to a multi-ethnic sorority, Lambda 
Psi Delta. A couple of groups only wanted 
to have people from their race [in the soror-
ity]. They said that everyone was welcome, 
but they weren't. I found that irritating.,. 
She adds, "The exclusivity needs to go. I'm 
a person first." 
Walker feels her biggest challenge as a 
minority at Yale isn't the ethnic counselor-
