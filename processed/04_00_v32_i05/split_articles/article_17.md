A
T THE AGE OF 17, Anders Corr read "Self-Reliance" and took 
to heart Ralph Waldo Emerson's advice to "learn to detect 
and watch the gleam of light which flashes across his mind from 
within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages." 
He dropped out of high school, renounced his American citizen-
ship, and spent much of the next decade as a squatter-activist fight-
ing for the right of the homeless to live on vacant "private proper-
ty." Keeping this personal history in mind while waiting to meet 
him at Atticus, I scanned the tables, searching for dreadlocks, pierc-
ings and other tell-tale signs of a radical in the midst of clean-cut 
Yale students. Corr, however, had no trouble blending in. Now a 
Yalie himself, the 30-year-old junior's conservative haircut, horn-
rimmed glasses and chic patent leather shoes belie his exceptional 
past and the nonchalance with which he recounts scouring dump-
sters for food, getting deported from Kenya and Mexico, and 
spending three weeks in solitary confinement for refusing to wear 
an identification bracelet while in a California prison. 

As I sit down with Corr he shakes my hand unassumingly. 
When the waiter comes over; he orders a cookie, then changes his 
mind and asks for a menu. Laughing at himself, he decides on the 
cookie. I ask him some questions about squatting, but he seems 
more interested in talking about his classes and thoughts on poli-
tics. 'Tm focusing on whether it makes sense to have global inte-
gration and take away borders between nation scares," he tells me. 
"What I am doing right now is all about getting rid of borders." I 
press him to describe his time as a squatter camping on unoccupied 
land and scavenging for food. "Oh yeah, here." He takes out a hard-
cover book and hands it to me. "I need that back, though, it's my 
only copy." 

The tome is Corr's book No Trespassing, released last fall by 
South End Press, a small, nonprofit publisher in Cambridge. It doc-
uments his own experience as a squatter and defends the rights of 
others-from peasants in Honduras to disaffected punks in New 
York City-to live freely on unoccupied land and in abandoned 
buildings. In No Trespassing, Corr draws on both historical and con-
14 
temporary examples to argue that squatting is the ultimate form of 
protest against a fundamentally unjust economic and political sys-
tem. I flip to the "About the Author" in the back of the book. His 
resume boasts an impressive list of publications for which he has 
written-The New York Times, The San Francisco Examiner, Anarchy 
Magazine, and Squat BeautifUL 

While No Trespassing makes a compelling and well-considered 
intellectual argument, its real significance lies in its call to action. 
The book's final line quotes Elvia Alvarado, a Honduran squatter: 
"I hate to offend you, but we won't get anywhere by just writing and 
reading books," she told Corr. "The important thing is for you to 
do something." Corr, not one for sanctimonious rhetoric, has spent 
much of his life fulfilling this ideal. 

After growing up as the only child of a single mother in Santa 
Cruz, CA, Corr spent his junior year in high school as an American 
Field Service exchange student in Kenya. During his stay in 
Nairobi, he was exposed to a level of poverty that made a profound 
impression on him. In the midst of such deprivation, he began to 
question the causes of social and economic inequality around the 
globe. "I began to wish for a world that did not order its agricul-
tural ·or political states through police and military force, lines of 
property, and international boundaries drawn on maps." More 
importantly, Corr questioned his own role in such a system. "I read 
. Tolstoy and Gandhi. I became a pacifist and an internationalist." 

A month before he was scheduled to return to California, Corr 
marched into the American embassy in Nairobi, passport in hand, 
and renounced his citizenship. "I saw that by using a United Stares 
passport, I tacitly participated in what I considered an injustice." 
Bewildered embassy officials were unsure how to respond to this 
well-read, precocious, and idealistic 17 year-old. They promptly 
expelled him from the country and sent him home. 

Back in San'ta Cruz, Corr was a changed man. His Quaker 
background had already given him a pacifist and socially-conscious 
world-view, but his exposure to the slums and srarvation of Nairobi 
had convinced him to reject sociery altogether. In a consummately

Emersonian act of defiance, he biked into Mexico without a pass-
port, a cicizen of the world filled with indignation. After evading 
border controls and police for several hundred miles, Corr was 
finally apprehended and detained by officials in Mazaclin. "They 
said that I could either pay for a plane ticker back to the U.S. or go 
to prison," recalls Corr. His principles demanded that he go to 
prison. But, a sympathetic citizen of the United States paid for him 
to fiy back to California. 

Just t8 years old, Corr decided to drop out of society as com-
pletely as possible. "I asked the question, 'How is it justified for me 
co spend money at all when there are people starving all over the 
world?' I wanted co live without spending any money," he explains. 
Over the next three months, he lived on just forty cents, camping 
in the woods outside of Santa Cruz and sustaining himself on 
organic milk and half-eaten sandwiches scavenged nightly from a 
dumpster behind a health food store. Once, Corr tells me, he 
almost are a bag of tofu that was mixed with shards of glass. He 
laughs. "Whatever. If there's food in a dumpster and there are peo-
ple starving, I should ear that food--even if it's a lircle dangerous." 

While squatting, Corr was constantly harassed by cops and 
property owners. During those days and his subsequent time as a 
homeless rights activist, he was arrested 17 rimes and spent a total 
offour months in jail. I ask him about prison. "It was intense, it was 
a learning experience, bur not intolerable. I read Th~ htkra/ist 
Papn-1 in prison," he notes with a couch of irony. Even when threat-
ened with harsh treatment by cops and prison guards, Corr retained 
his commitment to noncompliance and pacifism. His incarcera-
tions were often prolonged because, in defiance of a system which 
he saw as perpetuating injustice, Core would refuse co sign forms 
allowing him to leave without bail. 

During one stint in a Santa Cruz jail, 
Corr 
removed 
his 
prisoner 
identification bracelet, similar to the 
one a patient wears in a hospital. "It's 
dehumanizing, it's implying that you're 
sick because you're in jail. So I refused to wear it ... and they put me 
in solitary confinement for three weeks." 

Corr relates all of this to me marrer-of-factly, as if describing 
the boring details of a high school graduation. Trying co imagine 
the person before me living our the story he tells, I ask him if he was 
as clean cut then as he is now. He laughs. "I was more clean cur back 
then." 

Just a few months after he started squatting, Corr began ro 
depart from his radical asceticism. In Quaker meetings, many of his 
peers condemned his lifestyle, particularly his defiant noncompli-
ance with the law. Corr wanted to defend his views in writing. "I 
knew that what I was doing was right, and I wanted co explain 
that." His casual tone undercuts any self-indulgence which the 
effort might imply. Although he began with the intention of writ-
ing no more than a pamphlet, Core's scope quickly grew. Influenced 
by people as diverse as Rigoberta Menchu and Mark Twain, he saw 
close connections between his experience and land occupation 
efforts worldwide. "Land and housing movements are infinitely 
diverse, yet enjoy exciting trans-global coalitions," he wrote. The 
idea evolved into a full-scale study of squatting and squatters' rights 
movements around the world and throughout the twentieth centu-
ry. Corr ended his days as a squatter and reemerged as a member 
of society, dividing his rime between writing, activism, and work. 
Bur, he emphasizes, this in no way implied a break in his com-
mitment ro radical change and direct action. Indeed, two years 
Later, he returned ro squatting. "I've avoided the rigors of ... outdoor 
squatting for the last seven years," Corr wrote in the book's intro-
duction, "bur I began writing this book as a squatter, and I hope 
that squatter spirit permeates irs pages." Even as he started accept-
