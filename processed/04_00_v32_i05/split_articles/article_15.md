NE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, a young black woman arrived in 
Washington, DC, intent on leading her community. She 
raised her voice against unfair voting laws, segregation, and lynch-
ing, and she didn't quiet down for 61 years. Her speeches inspired 
action, and her work was the basis for the inclusion of women into 
the National Baptist Convention. Her name was Nannie Helen 
Burroughs, and a century after she began her crusade, Reverend 
Eric Smith is well into his. 

Since arriving at the Newhallville Community Baptist Church 
five years ago, this energetic computer-programmer-turned-pastor 
has tirelessly worked to rejuvenate the Newhallville neighborhood 
of New Haven and to strengthen the Church's role in town aff.Ucs. 
Smith's current project is the Nannie Helen Burroughs School, an 
Afrocentric Christian school opening this fall. "Sunday is the warm-
up act," he says, a huge grin spreading over his face. "Monday 
through Saturday is the show." 

Smith has been working Monday through Saturday (in addi-
tion to his sizeable Sunday duties) since 1997, setting up commit-
tees and boards so that, come this fall, the Burroughs School will be 
able to run entirely on its own, allowing him to focus on his next 
project: a credit union in Newhallville geared at stimulating local 
business. The Burroughs School, after all, is only one part of 
Community 
Baptist's 
massive 
Community Development 
Corporation (CDC), a hub of urban renewal that Smith engineered 
himself. Other projects include a daycare center for working fami-
lies, a substance abuse clinic, a job-rcain.ing facility, and a low-
income housing development. 

None of this would have happened had Smith not been called 
into the ministry in 1992 while working as a computer programmer 
and consultant in New Britain. He's not your average techie--he is 
built more like a linebacker than a hacker. Smith began raking class-
es at the Yale Divinity School and left his job at Command Systems 
Consulting in 1995 to work at Community Baptist with irs cele-
brated pastor, Reverend Thomas Holmes. Smith enjoyed working 
with Holmes so much that in 1996 he moved his family to 
Newhallville just to be closer to him. At this point in the story 
Smith leans back in his chair, a quiz.z.ical expression on his face, and 
says, "Literally while we were moving our things out of the truck, 
we found out that Reverend Holmes had just died." Smith says that 
in spite of the fateful timing of this event, he had come to do a job, 
and set about doing it. When he began at Community Baptist as 
12 
by Andy Cowdery 
interim pastor, it was first time in 25 years that someone other than 
Thomas Holmes delivered the Sunday sermon. 

"They didn't know what to do with me at first," Smith recalls 
of his inherited congregation, which was accustomed to milder ser-
mons than Smith wanted to deliver. Eventually they warmed to 
Smith's more energetic style, and, three years after being named 
Community Baptist's full pastor, he has become one of New 
Haven's mosr effective community leaders, largely because of 
intense and broad-based support from his congregation. 

Indeed, many of those currently working on the Nannie Helen 
Burroughs School are members of Community Baptist. Three years 
ago planning began for the School, designed as a cultural alrerna-
rive for students (or parents) dissatisfied with the public school sys-
tem's ueatment of race, religion, and history. 

The Burroughs School will enroll only kindergarten and first 
grade students this fall, but will eventually run through the eighth 
grade as it expands with each incoming class. Classes wilJ have 20 
students, and Smith is adamant that the School maintain a student-
to-reacher ratio of 20:1. The School's Afrocenrcic focus will come 
primarily from irs curriculum. The Burroughs School wilJ most 
likely use the A B~ka Book text, used at over 17,000 Christian 
schools nationwide. Though some members of the School's cur-
riculum committee feel that the A B~ka Book, used at many pre-
dominantly white schools, would not accurately reAect African cul-
ture, Smith believes that reachers can combine the text with their 
own cultural perspective to create a sufficiently Afrocentric focus. 
This year, while the School is still rather small (40 students), class-
es will meet on the lower Aoor of Community Baptist. Starting in 
the fall of 2001, the Burroughs School will occupy irs own building 
in NewhaJlville. Funding for the School has come from local cor· 
porations, regional banks, private donations, and Community 
Baptist itself, which devoted five percent of its income. 

For now, however, Smith .is still focused on ensuring that the 
Burroughs School will open without a hitch. Helping his cause is 2 
great number of volunteers who have signed on ro write up school 
bylaws, drum up interest in the community, and design the cur· 
riculum. Many of the volunteers have personal motivations for join-
ing Smith's team. "We were new to the neighborhood," said Jolyn 
Walker, who came to Milford several years. ago with her young son. 
"and we ran into some incidents in the public school system." She 
pauses a moment, then continues slowly. "He was spit upon, and
