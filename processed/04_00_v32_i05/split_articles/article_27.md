They pointed out that the Myrtle Beach "tradition" was only about 
6ve years old. Other schools, such as Swarthmore, Haverford, 
Temple, and Duke, had decided to move their spring break or 
training out of South Carolina. Now these Yalies just had to

said Josh. "Almost everyone we talked to was in favor
of the Confederate flag coming down, but a lot of people offered a
range of reasons that boycotting is not the way to get the flag
down . . . My sense was that a lot of people for whatever reason wanted
to figure out a way that going to Myrtle Beach was okay."
Maybe it was because they were discussing remote symbols,
peripheral to their daily lives. Most of the people involved in the
campaign had spent very little time in the South, and most, it
seemed, had little direct experience with racism. Meanwhile, the
black community at Yale was far from spearheading this campaign.
Thorn Cantey, the lone black student at the first meeting, said, "I
felt a sort of directed ambivalence about this thing. The whole concept of going to support a Southern beach at all has no great appeal
for me." The Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) lent their voice
to the February 28 press conference called by Ingber and her friends
and put up a few flyers. But their basic attitude towards the campaign was summed up by Eliada Nwosu, a leader of BSAY: "I am not
surprised by the lack of support the boycott is getting from our

Meanwhile, members of the Yale community old enough to remember Freedom
Summer greeted the controversy with a
combination of bitterness and bewilderment. Glenda Gilmore, a native North
Carolinian and professor of Southern history, in a statement at the anti-Myrtle press
conference, said, "If someone had told me
during the civil rights movement that the
Confederate flag would be flying over
South Carolina in the year 2000, I would
have laughed at them. There are times in
your life to make a stand, even if it is
inconvenient, even if you lose your
deposit." Barbara Strauss, a self-described
"middle-aged, Republican mother of a Yale
undergraduate," wrote the YDN expressing
her incredulity at the controversy's very
existence: "What could you be thinking?
Your parents and prior generations of Yale
students filled buses, and risked their lives
traveling down South to take a stand for
civil rights in the '60s. Not to mention,
how could you be so insulting to the students of color in your own class? This is not
a tough call. You don't have to take over a
building. You don't have to march on
Selma. Just take your week in the sun on
some other stretch of beach."
The Yale Administration, on the other
hand, does seem to find the scale of the
Confederacy to be a tough call. Lury Hau,
the Director of Public Affairs, told me,
"The Administration has not taken a position on this controversy." The students
made several efforts to get, if not support,
then at least a public statement on
the controversy. Rodberg said, "We have
asked, and parents have written asking
for the Administration to take a stand, as a
matter of moral leadership." The only
stance Yale officially took was not to move
the men's and women's track team training
over spring break out of South Carolina.

Administration's inaction, "It is not the
Administration's place to dictate to students decisions of conscience. It is each student's responsibility to search his or her
heart and determine whether going to
vacation under the Confederate flag is a
good idea." Her support of the boycott,
however, and the support of other faculty
members like Rogers M. Smith, a native
South Carolinian, lent moral authority to

the cause, partly because they were among
the few Southerners to speak publicly on
the issue.
Back in South Carolina, the controversy over the relic of a 135-year-old, defeated
government continues to smolder. State
legislators remain adamant, declaring the
flag a historic symbol of Southern independence, not of slavery or racism. But the
boycott seems to be having some effect. A
