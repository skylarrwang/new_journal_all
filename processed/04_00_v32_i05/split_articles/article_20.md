EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Artspace, a non-profit organization located in a former factory building on Audubon Street, is described as "chameleon-like." The room is void of 
decoration, giving the artists great free-
dom to install their pieces as they see fit. 
With each exhibit, the space is reinvented. 
When I visited untitled (space), there 
was no exhibit and nothing to see except 
the stack beauty of the room itself. I 
quickly realized the delicate humor of the 
situation. Standing in this barren gallery, I 
was enacting Artspace's mission: to 
redefine perceptions of art. Each click of 
my camera's shutter was an effort to turn 
this basement gallery bereft of art into a 
work of art itself.


Ten minutes later I walked through a 
fence on Chapel Street into a collection of 
painted rocks that traced a spiral around 
my feet and provided a sharp contrast to 
the surrounding brick walls and piles of 
glass and dirt that filled the once-aban-
doned lot I stood in. I had come to pho-
tograph Artspace's newest project, the 
New Haven Labyrinth, or "the Lot," as 
Kauder and Bernstein insistently called it, 
underscoring both the innovative use of 
this space and its transient nature. The 
labyrinth, which is composed of rocks decorated by New Haven residents ranging from elementary school students to cancer 
patients, was opened on January 1, 2000, and will soon be dismantled. "The labyrinth has transformed the way people see Chapel 
Street," said Bernstein. "They will never see it the same way again." But Bernstein and Kauder believe that after a few months 
people will stop noticing the labyrinth, and the lot will be no more to passing eyes than a vacant public space. They plan to intro-
duce a series of temporary projects, including a giant suspended chair, to keep the space engaging. Said Bernstein, "Change is 
necessary to keep people seeing."
