NE LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON, as commuter traffic was at its 
peak in New Haven, Metro Taxi drivers were lining up as 
always in from of Union Station--only that day, they were nor 
picking up the businessmen and students who gathered by the taxi 
stop. An estimated 6o cab drivers gathered co join a one-lane pro-
cession that would circle the New Haven Green and Yale campus 
several times. I joined Donel Ballaird, one of four spokesmen for 
the Metro Taxi drivers. Ballaird's car was third in the procession, 
and from the rear window I watched the line of cabs, each adorned 
with blue rally balloons, snake around the Green behind us. As we 
passed Phelps Gate, I saw students hunched over the nearby blue 
phone, black suitcases at their sides, angrily making call after fran-
-'-"' ..... -••• call. 

Ballaird pointed ar his computer screen and whisded in amaze-
"Look at all those jobs!• Thanks ro Metro T~'s high-tech 
11:;t;:Orrlpu.cer dispatch system, he could count them as rbey built up. 
people were waiting at Sr. Raphael's Hospital, aad another 
had called in from the train station. He counted 15 trusrrated 
~~ ·pie in all, waiting co be picked up by cabs. 

Ballaird knew he was nor the only one eyeing the computer 
,...~r"'l'n. Metro Taxi owner Bill Scalzi would also see the increasing 
of waiting custOmers from the company's headquarters in 
F.t~u~, Haven. The 6o drivers who participated in cbe March 31 
II:'J.:iftl•rot:est sacrificed their most profitable hours of busiacss co make 
l~il'llfl"::::ar ro Scalzi their determination to unionize. In "Our lime Has 
~~U..:Orne," a letter encouraging Metro Taxi drivers to join the fight to 
'!.~uu•Dru~, steering committee secretary Briao MacFarlane outlined 
the goals of the protest. "Our most important campaign right now 
is to unite and attempt to gain the power to negotiate a fair contract 
that allows us the power to control our work conditions. We should 
have the ability to control our leases, set credits for downtime, and 
to prevent unfair work practices such as the non-fault accident 
penalty." 

Metro Taxi drivers began to push for collective bargaining 
rights five weeks ago when, on March 7, Scalzi atlOOunced that. he 
was raising weekly lease rates by $So--from $640 tO $720 a week 
for new cars and from $6xo to $690 for older models. Mike 
Cacioppo, another of the spokesmen for the protesting drivers, 
explained that the new rates, coupled with inflated gas prices, drove 
weekly operating costs to alm01t $xooo. "Most cab drivers have co 
work 14 to 16 hours a day, scwa1 days a week, to make enough 
money to live," he told me. DriYen were not satisfied when Scalzi 
lowered the rates by $)0 as a r....,.-:ary measure to offset the rise in 
gas prices. They wanted the ~to 
negotiate. "(Scalzi] doesn't 
recognize us as spokesmen fo.- chc other cab drivers, even though 
the other cab drivers picke<{ us llO be spokesmen for them," 
Cacioppo c:x:plained co me. "~try to work with him, bur he won't 
work with us. Everything be doa. tie does ro benefit him." 

Scalzi, however, claimed -- Ia QOt againsc unions in general,
