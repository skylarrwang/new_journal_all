EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This is a blue stopping view 
A church mitre with a thin metal cross 
Crossing a land strip countless distances 
Above a cold September yawn of lake 
Wind-riffled, blue and eloquent 
To the right is a single spot sailboat 
Inspired to sail no doubt yet photo stopped 
A stopped triangle 
The cross puts the landscape in focus 
Puts it in indisputable reference 
With respect to the one metal axis 
So all may be located and plotted 
The stopped triangle of the sailboat 
Being simply to the right 
The fmger strip of land simply above 
The church axiomatically below 
On the banks of the shore climbing away 
From the church at a loping right angle 
Are flower gardens white green and rust red 
Each color picked for some special reason 
Each plant regulated in row and kind 
By some perfect squaring monk who one day 
Inspired by the cross atop the church 
Saw Christ and laid angles on the world
