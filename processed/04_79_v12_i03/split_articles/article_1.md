My room was small and after a few
weeks it had become like a ship's
cabin. At night the leaves on the tree
in the yard threw shadows on the
ceiling that moved lazily when there
was little wind and quickly when the
wind was stronger. When it rained the
leaves trembled and I lay in bed and
watched them and listened to them,
and knew I wouldn't sleep. Some
nights after too many Pernods the
room reeled and I would have to turn
on the light or walk around in the
space between the bed and the closet
until I could try to sleep again.


It was the beginning of the Fall and
the shadows on my ceiling were
growing thinner. In the cafes and on
the Boulevards thin overdressed
painters talked to their long-legged
models about war. We knew the war
was coming, but we didn't worry
about it. Gabriele talked most about
the war. She was an Etudiante en
Philosophie but all she liked was
novels and sex, in that order, and she
liked our Ernest Hemingway and
talked about the commencement of
hostilities. I thought that since her
English wasn't good and Hemingway
in French sounds ghastly she should
be, say, Saint-Exupery instead. We
didn't know why Hemingway and
Saint-Ex hadn't been friends and
thought we could make up for it.
Each one had probably thought the
other was a phoney. Hemingway's
idea of a French phoney was
Malraux, and he probably was right. I
don't suppose Malraux ever thought
much about Hemingway, but if he did
he probably called him a phoney.
Anyway after one evening it was clear
that Gabriele as Saint-Ex was a bit
weak, while as Harry Morgan or Ole
Andresen she was inaccurate although
inspired. After that we let her be who
she wanted. It seemed better that way,
since they were all dead.


I had left my room about half-an-
hour before and now I was sitting
inside the Flore, reading the news-
paper. The Flore had once been a fine
cafe but like all the ones on Saint-
Germain it had ceased to be a cafe
long ago in order that it might
become more of a cafe for the sake of
my compatriots, and I no longer
patronized it much. Since it was the
Fall I was thinking that perhaps we
could start planning to go to Schruns
for the winter. Maybe it was later in
the Fall that you started to think
about Schruns, but I wasn't sure.
Then Catherine saw me through the
window as she walked by the cafe and
she came over to my table and sat
down without saying hello.
-
Hello, I said.
Darling, how are you? What are
you drinking?
Pernod.
Will you order me one?
I called the garcon and gave her
order and he nodded and scribbled it
on his pad the way Sartre had said. I
asked Catherine about Schruns.
No, it's too early, she said. And
in Schruns you have to be tired and
happy in the evenings and you can't
do that on schoolwork. And besides, I
don't want to have to lose your
manuscripts.
I agreed.
We can stay here then and
pretend about Schruns.
That will be grand. And we can
go to Gstaad at Christmas and stay at
the Rossli and that will already be
something.


That was true, and I knew Gstaad
was good and I must be thankful I
had it. We finished the pernods and
Catherine wanted another. This time
she called the waiter herself. She
ordered and when he left she said:
"And there might be the war. You
forgot about the war."


If there was the war then we
couldn't go to Gstaad. But there were
many other places we could go to
fight, and it was just a matter of
choice. War had the same sadness and
mud and dead eighteen-year-olds no
matter where you went, y se acabo.
Point final. E basta. ••That 's it," I
thought. Pernod was good for
languages and good for soldiers and
students who were cold and fright-
ened. It was awfully easy to be
Hemingway about everything when
you were sober, but with the pernods
it was another thing.

a "true-to-life" story
The Musee Provencale de Skull-
duggaire in St. Tropez is a vaulted
cathedral-like building nestled be-
tween the Cafe Bof and an eatery
called La Tour Blanc on a side street
some two short blocks from the
beach. Bobby Bright, Yale under-
graduate, regarded the Musee with a
wistful glance and sighed.
"That is a beautiful building," he
said, not quite to himself.
"Cest magnifique! Toujours belle!"
said a miniature tramp at his side.
"Oh, go away!" said Bobby Bright.
.. No money here. Pas d'argent! Go
'way! Shoo!"
The tramp hurried off and Bobby's
thoughts returned to the building
before him. He had looked at it at
least four, maybe five times a day
since he first arrived in St. Tropez.
That was four -
maybe five -
weeks
ago. Time was running on. Some day
he would pay the Musee a visit.
"Visite, .. he thought to himself.
Right now, however, he was headed
for Ia plage. That meant beach,
Bobby knew. His roommate had given
him a crash course in French the
., week before the last semester ended.
Mter all, Bobby was going to France,
and it might help if he knew a word
or two of the local argot.


And it was only fitting that Bobby
should make some kind of token
effort to justify the trip. Just think -
$1200 given him, Scot-free, by the
Bates Fellowships back at Yale. Oh,
he was supposed to study old Pro-
vencal manuscripts dealing with the
wars between Louis the Insane and
Michael the Saracen or somesuch -
but nobody was really going to check
up on him. And anyway, no one
could. Nobody in the entire world
knew a damned thing about Louis the
Insane's dealings with Michael the
Saracen for the very good reason that
Bobby had made Michael the Saracen
up. That would be okay, he knew; the
Bates people. never checked.


Now, at long last, the money was
running out. Yesterday Bobby had
had to dip into his own savings, and
it looked as though he might end by
wiring home for his plane fare. He
slowly counted the bills in the pocket
of his beach costume. One- two-
three- four- five ... enough for
dinner tonight .. . and then what? He
would have to leave Monday. Yes,
that was it. Monday.


Bobby Bright again looked at the
Musee before him. His curiosity grew.
It might be very pretty inside. He
might even ·be able to see a medieval
manuscript or two. Should he . . . ?
Would he ... ?


Cautiously Bobby approached the
front door of the building. He read
the sign on the old oaken door. It was
closed this week, Bobby translated to
himself. It was closed for the coming
month. Bobby shed a tear and heaved
a sigh of relief.


Fingering the bills lightly in his
pocket, Bobby made his way toward
the beach.
