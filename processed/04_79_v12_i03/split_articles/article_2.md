Loved Her Hated Him
The Harald Hardrada Quartet. 
Sidney Wilson

I

Notice, gentlemen, the young lady in the far 
corner. Let us call her exhibit A. She is the object 
of my desire. 

Exhibit A's brother, Harald Hardrada, is my 
roommate. You may see him, this very moment -
if that is where you are -
on York Street, striding 
past the Yale Dramat; the red scarf carelessly 
knotted around his neck, one length hanging down 
his stomach, the other flapping over his shoulder 
in this crisp Northerly. We shall call this red scarf 
exhibit B. It symbolizes my passion for its owner's 
sibling. Exhibit C is the above-mentioned 
Northerly. 

Gentlemen, my burden is heavy. I love this lady 
with all the weak knees, the pitted stomachs, all 
the trembling fingers and heaving tenderness in 
Christendom. I alternate -
in hideous suffering -
between the loftiest aspirations and the most 
somber designs; yet it makes no difference, no 
matter how I put it. I cannot reach her. She 
scorns, spurns, rebuffs, and excludes me. 

My roommate, Hardrada, a personable fellow in 
all respects, I loathe. I suspect him of laughing at 
my plight. Of course I have not told him. He 
merely surmises; but rightly. Just yesterday 
evening he accused me of being overly celibate; 
but then, he makes up for it. He keeps the room's 
average up; he fucks anything that moves. He 
discards his jockstrap on the living-room floor, 
and fucks it, and maybe, even, he fucks his sister. 
Oh, gentlemen! 

I will now introduce D. D is our room, a three-
room double in Branford College; soon all 
elements will be assembled there. Hardrada and 
his scarf are fumbling with their gate-key and will 
presently ascend the spiral staircase and enter. My 
Hard Lady of Yale is about to open the window in 
order that the Northerly might dispel the smoke 
from my chain of nervous and strained cigarettes. 

I implore you, gentlemen, and you, bitch, to 
prevent the conjoining of these circumstances. 
Their imminent combination already fills me with 
despair.

I swear it's true, and now I will tell you about 
it. Last year, I went to Norway. Norway, as you 
all know, lies next to Sweden, in the North, up 
and a little to the left or the right of Europe. My 
roommate, Harald Hardrada, comes from 
Norway, but I didn't yet know him when I went 
there. I only met Hardrada last month, and 
though I like Norwegians, Lord I hate Hardrada. 
He has a cute sister and I'd like to crawl all over 
her, but this is taking us away from our subject, 
which is Norway and my trip there last year, a 
true story mind you, even though Thuli Vemsl,l 
Hardrada is not only a ripe one, but also a 
Norwegian. 

Many of you have heard of Norway. It is a 
country, not an island or a continent. Ingmar and 
Ingrid Bergman, and Liv Ullmann, too, are not 
Norwegian but Swedish, like Bjorn Borg; and they 
are all very proud of it. Knut Hamsun might have 
been Norwegian, and Malcolm Lowry displayed a 
marked fondness for a character called Sigbjll!lm 
Wilderness, who was apparently quite as Nor-
wegian as Nordahl Grieg, a famous one. 

Lapps, Finns, Danes, Siberian Huskies, Spitz-
bergen, Greenlanders, Icelandics and Eskimo, 
none of them are from Norway. Jack London, as 
his name indicates, was not, in any way that I can 
tell, or have heard of, connected with the place. 

You should not go there either. It is a thoroughly 
poisonous land.

Back in Norway Hardrada had a snowmobile all 
his own, color canary, called Ski-doo. He used it 
to run away from moose, who galloped by the 
herd in the opposite direction, crashing toward the 
forest, terrified by the sound of the motor. 

Now exiled from his native tundra, Harald 
Hardrada slumbers in a suite in Branford College. 
Visions assail him. The moose. The Ski-doo now; 
the engine is his alarm-clock. Hardrada splutters, 
coughs, heaves himself across the bed and yanks 
the cord out of the wall. He swears, in English: 
Ah Shitfuck, he says, and groans: the clockface 
reads 2 A.M. Brother, forget it, he thinks. He pulls 
his clothes off, slides into a warm hollow beneath 
the covers. Soon the moose embrace him. 

In the morning, Hardrada will report to student 
medicine, there to procure proof of illness for the 
peace of mind of Teacher's Asst. Peteter Boylens, 
a blond-haired red-head grad student with piercing 
eagle's eyes behind inch-thick convex lenses, whose 
sphere of influence stretches halfway round 
Linsley-Chit 101 twice a week, two fifty-minute 
intervals of existence spicing the eternity of self-
nihilation that he is within the P.-lii Sz. Dpt. 
"Peteter," HH will then say, "I hev got iip lass 
ntit 2EM to writ groinsweat pepper, but mental 
blCk. I em hexile, sick, ill, doying far Hawaii from 
hpme." 

Peteter flashes his eyes and nods forgiveness. 
"Next time, Harald, next time. Next week. Don't 
worry about it." 

Next week: "Peteter, tings moch bedder. All vik 
tings gud, den lass nut gorlfriend she gotta go 
captn futtbol fuck. I kennot schlip, I kennut dink, 
I kennit writ pepper." 

The excuses will stretch wearily through the 
remainder of the semester, grinding down Peteter's 
defenses like an endless rain; his outstretched hand 
retreats weekly further into his body, until, by 
reading period, it is no more than a helplessly 
quavering thalidomide flipper affixed to narrow 
academic shoulder, barely strong enough to 
receive the four by six-inch sheet of paper that 
Hardrada delivers with the death-blow: 
"Peteter, vi vet tu longg. Pepper kennat be writ. 
Here I hev Dinsexkus." 

And that is how Hardrada takes care of his 
work: administratively. I, his roommate, look on 
in horror ... Harald," I say, "write the paper. Write 
anything, or they'll flunk you." 

"Fuck off, shift head," he answers. "Go grind 
away, you wimp, leave me alone. Go buttwarm 
black vinyl in CCL, asshole, spill ersatz catpiss 
coffee on machine city formica and your polyester-
smegma linoleum Coop shirt. Let me sleep, Jerk." 

And Hardrada, an exile, goes corpselike on his 
bed. Peteter calls on the telephone, and HH is 
incensed by the ringing, he turns blue and bites 
through his pillow, spreading down all over the 
room, while I explain that Harald is not well, 
Peteter, not well at all; in fact, I am about to call 
Mental Hygiene, yes, that bad. It's the pressure, 
and he misses his home, Peteter, think of him 
home in the snow zipping over frozen solitude on 
tiny yellow Ski-doo; above him unfolds Aurora 
Borealis, you know, Peteter, up in Norway on a 
clear day you can even see the curvature of the 
Earth.

In the years after leaving the University I 
travelled four of the five continents and five of the 
seven seas in the shadow of Harald and Thuli 
Vemsl~ H. 

Harald was my roommate through our last year 
as undergraduates, at one of the influential Ivied 
phrontisteries of the North-eastern United States. I 
believe he was -
as a writer once put it -
one of 
those who appear to have been sent only to tell 
you something about your life; yet the years have 
not divulged his message. It hovered around my 
travels, peripherally, slightly out of reach, for a 
very long time -
but no longer; I think of him 
ever less often. What remains now of our 
acquaintance is a Husky bitch I acquired three 
winters ago, out of vague and somewhat 
embarrassed curiosity, because it so closely 
resembled the one he kept in our dormitory room. 
It maintained the freshness of our pillows by 
biting through them as soon as they began to tire 
and deflate, no longer in any way ominous to a 
puppy's imagination. And I have named it after 
his: Bogart. 

Of Hardrada himself there is little to say; the 
ambiguity of meaning that slipped behind our 
singularly formal relations was not a function of 
our college years, but of the following period of 
disorientation which retroactively qualifies any 
prolonged but now terminated residence within an 
institution; at the time, I was fascinated solely by 
his sister, Thuli Vems~. 

By an irony which seemed designed specifically 
to please me -
for I disliked Hardrada -
she was 
his physical antithesis: while he was very blond 
and pale, so much so that on first meeting him his 
faded blue eyes struck me as a denial of albinism, 
Thuli's hair was jet-black, very straight at 
shoulder-length, and her skin of an extraordinary 
peach quality. Her eyes, the iris framed by a 
narrow black circle, which lent it a sort of 
autonomy from the rest of her face, were also 
blue, but of a darker, richer shade. She was very 
tall, taller than Harald, almost as tall as I am; she 
wore blue-jeans -
something of a uniform in 
those days -
better than anyone I had ever seen, 
or have seen since. 

Until I met her, I could only think of her as 
primarily elusive. Before I shared rooms with 
Hardrada I could glimpse her no more than once 
every two or three months, in the post-office, on 
the steps in front of the library, in the university 
store; and once, late on a Saturday night, when 
finally I had become convinced that she had left 
for what we called, somewhat self-consciously, a 
"leave of absence," I saw her in the oversize 
parking-lot of a roadside movie-house a few miles 
down the coast from the campus, where I had 
driven with two friends to see the season's success. 
It was Looking for Mr. Goodbar, and I remember 
it only because, upon exiting and stepping down 
into the lot, I saw her very far away, instantly 
recognizable, wandering noiselessly across the 
beam of a spotlight illuminating a corner of 
asphalt through an exceptionally warm April 
night. A car door slammed shut, and she vanished 
for five months; I leaned on my window-sill, 
having just finished unpacking, as a small French 
car, its sun-roof open, pulled to a stop across the 
street. Both doors opened, the left one yielding 
Hardrada, the right one the girl; I didn't yet know 
they were brother and sister. 

And I was foiled from the start: she didn't help 
him carry his bags to the room. 

-
My name is Hardrada, he said. 
Hello, Harald. 
I was in Calhoun last year. I hope this'll be 
better. 

Calhoun, another college on the campus -
mine, now his, was Branford, after a neighboring 
town -
was to my knowledge no better or worse 
than any other; I told him that I wished him luck; 
he grunted, and thus began the last year of my 
education.
