holster his nose kept inches from the shop street 
glass did he see me 
hugging myself shaking beneath a burned-out 
lampost under the snow of nite i met him by he 
stumbled bundled up tight stingy-rapt, a refugee 
pace by proud pace he plowed his path he had 
closed his eyes and deserted he would die with the 
wind in his face to fate, face to the west in wild 
abandon retreat into the desert aspiring de-
hydrated orphan leg amputated game leg limping 
drunken he had lavished the sand with a rough 
scarred tongue stuck clutch spit's sweat he ran the 
rail a long split picket fencefd he spat to spit and 
sought the winter shore of the burned bright sand 
assured i put my arm about him said come quiver 
together into the new day i came close to comfort 
whispering of the promised farmhouse bam down 
the road down south the home we'd both missed 
the lonely home where faith oft a quarter and 
takes bed in a humble prayer the forgotten home 
where a kind gesture is given and understood in 
kind, not loaned by the weak, not thought weak at 
all i reached to brush back his hair i asked him 
could he speak 
afbrusqut thumb slowly moving down a neck. 
fingers toy with an ear, squeeze the lobe, trace the 
jaw, and stretch the tenderest skin. again the 
thumb down the neck slides the hand slips to joiri 
it. fingers and thumb together they clasp, straining 
to collide. click, shut her. 
alabastard secure. crossed ivory white. thigh tite.

knifed at rape-point. blood red the bed some folks 
can't help wishin -
that kind's better off dead. 
better off dead than disguised -
like Ensign Gary 
Redletter thin-lipped equipped encountered Rouge 
S. and her twin sister's twin, the late Alibi 
Alibi asked for a five figure G he said glory she 
said gooey, green, jolly and giant "you're a goner" 
he said going she said when, however then of 
course the question was 
wide of the mark right off the bat a miserable 
start's ill-conceived end there always a neck-tie 
said Gary lost Alibi's not found again 
there must be a way out i know it she cried we 
could come down clean i've seen it it can't be 
denied 
quick magic hand breadth of a sleeve whispd

pillow promise sleep not grieve slipknot dangling 
she can't breathe hush hush meek Alibi, thou shalt 
believe 
sis she scenit she quit town her sister you touched 
her now she ain't around sis you seen her yes i'm 
sure she the one combin her hair in yr husband's 
eyes she on her knees, Mr. Washington, tweaxtz 
yr senator's thighs sis you watched her she'd pay 
to win "Sis Rouge, why -
haven't you heard, she 
moved to Berlin" 
in Berlin out of on the town time Rouge met. this 
here true hard to come by murican man he came 
off the pipeline, for the Fest, y'unnerstan. ravaged 
face and bloody passport he'd pay'd his tolls not 
muscatel, yacudteU, stained clothes, y'know 
and when they met, (that cultural occasion), it 
took a touch Sis on the ol whic-knic fnoc-knack 
specially since she asked she asked after she was 
after himandhis landmark. (demands delicacy, 
ya'gree) 
and when they met (it being a cultural occasion), 
they had to go about a bout -
their exchanging 
Troy Donahue, the autograph a smile a laughfter 
always awkward the laughter after words. 
as for me i admit it i too emitted right there i 
introduced them i picked them i took a pic its 
right here by m.y old fake i.d. Hear, y'see 
from the wallet, a plea 
me fickle pric.k salute relucant. at whim -
if and 
when and sometimes not at all. she was insulted 
however, no my limp flounde.ring seemed to her 
quite incomprehensible. comic and absurd. tho' 
such insubordination was without precedent she 
did not consider it an affront to her vanity -
how 
could she, such thoughts did not occur. au 
contraire, it tickled her little randy fancy it did. 
i too laughed. in such predicaments one must 
muster. yes boys when not the prick stiffen the 
upper lip and of course propriety demands no 
tiresome apologies. ·and dear ladies, should your 
lover fmd himself in this unfortunate predicament, 
do not think the pathetic fallacy the deluded's 
foolish solace. 


no it ain't a lame lie, this etiquette of impotence to 
be true love the little sub scout does have a will of 
his own you know it and i know it and we both 
know what he means to say and it is uh-uh thanks 
but no thanks 
yet when i think back to consider what i had 
presumed an unpardonable offense, i must admit 
her reaction was quite congenial, "sympathique" is 
the word, is it not my dear? 
whatever word what but not fear how could you 
snigger see me fear fear's no option no option 
knows no fear that word came to your mind not 
mine won't admit it fear's yr ticket it gyps you 
every time.

SX in a row, missed again, 
why i don't really know deep down inside was he

tell, impotent yet a gigolo?

a problem child don't talk to me of fear o dear 
ladies you know i've already met million of 'em
