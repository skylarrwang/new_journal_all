THE CHARIOT.

From an Old Dialogue
In memory of C. P. Cavafy
The Greek poet, licking a lone
Finger to smooth his eyebrow, said:
"Fate is the hand that separates
Us, cleaving between with all the
Force of tempests." He lived amid
Brilliant cities of the present,
Where the streets gleam more clearly
Than any god's flame -
languid voice
Breaking, head turning for a quick
Glance at the receding profile
Of a young loved one. Someone had
Just left the parlor quietly.

Now I asked him: "Then what binds us?
This fate is our only mother,
The arm bending all around us
To ease the tender quantity
Of infant two into grown one.
She flings the passion of surprise
From her hand." But I saw his eyes
Buried like layers of kingdoms,
Gone down below to early things,
And knew that no answer slept there.
This pale Alexandrian, sick
With the look of a photograph,
Speaks more slowly through the tarnish
Of Afterlife (brittle city
of followers, critics, lovers).
The power of once errant lips,
Eyes, fingers and wits trembles inside
His lost face -
and I remember
Even his own venturing through
Fate's loom and sharp, knotted spindle.
On a journey speeded by the
Grace of song and the promises
In new lustre, I still find him
And I am right -
on Fortune's rack.
Wasted by weak autumnal fires,
The poet in his silk cravat.

Return from Tokyo to Kyoto
Trajectory implicit in a rhyme
Betrays the band that seeks an and as mine
Already past this issue spelling time
One lines up squares and calls the boxes lines
Distraught recalls the promise of a ruse
Now newly offering the lure of can
Constraint of symbols borrowed to confuse
Which make one find a beggar in began
The concrete melts and masks its own disguise
And what seemed easy shines as broken glass
One peels away the foil from opaque glass
Demands a light and quickly shades one's eyes
To sigh if only one would not ask still
And flee the will of what, this why of will
