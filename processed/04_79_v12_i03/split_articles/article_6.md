Who's the Biggest Senti-God and Friend to You and Me? 
S: The first pizza I made, it was in 1963, was a 
great success. I couldn't believe it. People lift me 
up in their hands, there was clapping, they tour 
me around town, the band of the city was 
playing. . . 
. 
M: How old were you when you made your first 
pizza? 
S: Oh, uh, I don't know, that would give ·away my 
age ... 
M: You don't have to give away your age. 
S: I was 
. Now I'm going to start crying. 
Memories -
all these memories! And then we 
used to go up to the lake and drink beer and eat 
pizza ... 
M: This was in Greece? 
S: No, no! This was here! In central Connecticut! 
And then my second pizza was my biggest, 
biggest, yet. People were applauding and ever 
since I know that I would definitely be a semi-god 
if I would live two thousand years ago. But, that 
is, if I would have Eukleides to invent a pizza 
dough for me. 
Spiro. Matsos, Pizzamaker to the Stars 
S: Making pizza is one of the loveliest occupations 
that anybody can be in. The people that you meet! 
I mean the song people, the dance people, the 
people people ... Of course, that is, if you like 
people. Because I know some very grouchy pizza 
people, and some of them run the leading pizza 
places in New Haven. . . 
· 
Yale has to admit that it is very lucky that I'm 
here, one of the definite semi-gods of the pizza. 
S: Someday I am going to do a musical based on 
the Bulldog. I will have a small part myself on 
stage, of course. 
M: Will you make pizza on stage? 
S: Oh, definitely. 111 wear my apron and do a 
dance. 
S: We were on national television last year, a 
gentleman from the CBS Morning News, he said 
that a "Barker" calls the Bulldog and barks every 
night for a whole year and he is going to be 
barking until he graduates from Yale ... And on 
Christmas Day he even called from Los Angeles 
and barked at the Bulldog ... 
And then another fine young man called one 
time and he wanted to be the Bulldog Meower ... 
But I don't know. I don't think the Bulldog can 
have a Meower. But he is a good customer. 
S: If I had a fifteen-store chain of pizzerias 
without knowing anybody I would be very 
unhappy. Now I'm going to do this one day, but 
I'll definitely have one little store that I would be 
working like I always have since 1963. Of course I 
might just take a little break in between and 
record another album, another long-playing record 
like· I done in 1973 -
singing some of my favorite 
songs with one of the leading ladies of the Greek 
recording business ... 
M: Who's that? 
S: Oh, well of course her name is not familiar on 
the American market, but she is a very great lady, 
a very talented young lady -
Jet me see now, we 
have two pastrami, two -
oh, I see, we have three 
tunas -
that's correct, I'm sorry about that. .. 
Have to make these for the Campaign for Yale. 
Sometimes I call them the Champagne for Yale. 
Every time I deliver the pizzas there they are 
drinking wine and champagne ... 
S: Mrs. Mary Jane Taft, she is the second leading 
(pizza buyer) of all time. Fifty-five pizzas have 
gone to her. Entertaining the New York ballet 
company. 
M: The New York City Ballet? When was this? 
S: A few months back. 
M: How did you make fifty-five pizzas at once? 
S: Oh, come on, when you've been making pizzas 
since 1963, you can make -
M: But, l mean, you don't have the facilities ... 
S: Yes, yes, you make it with one oven and a little 
bit of love. Don't forget that I would be a semi-
god if I lived two thousand years ago. 
S: Just like I was saying before, gentlemen, the 
Bulldog in downtown Tel Aviv, it might upset 
some of the Greeks in that area, but it's going to 
be very successful: Matsos Pizza -
in downtown 
Tel Aviv. Making pizzas for the Iranian king and 
the head of the old Greek military coup. We're 
going to have Bulldog copters to do the delivery 
on the war lines on the Suez Canal. We're going 
to have B-52's make aerial bombardments with 
pizza to the troops. 
S: We are famous this year, gentlemen. We are 
going to appear in the Yale yearbook. In person, 
the Bulldog is going -
are you graduating this 
year? 
M: Yes. 
S: You are, so you can take the yearbook back 
home and point to the Bulldog and tell your 
mother, Mother, she (the Bulldog) fed me away 
from home. That's beautiful. How lucky can you 
get?
