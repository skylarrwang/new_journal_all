one's first, but the other is best, and i suppose

senseless no point i agree sometimes when yr
getting lost it gets outta hand i can but tell you
what i saw and if there's a message it's simple: no
comma no or no and
down the street a dog was barking. i could hear
his call but the window afforded only a limited
glimpse of the street below. perhaps i could have
opened the window but the cool morning air
would have woke her. besides it would have been
too obvious. how could i explain the attraction of
a stray's bark.
besides the cool morning air would have woke her.
sleeping dogs, lettem lie and as usual she lay
sleeping she played no part no longer huddled
beneath the blanket like a timorous child on her
side on the side of the bed her body and the
covers converged in a corner around which she
peeked i spied her lookin lookin at me her sneaky
eyes closed the fox i sought to go her a round but
she played no part no longer
fuck it fuck her why w 1 stand put up or shut up no
choice i went to the bed i slammed my hand the
butt in the mouth teeth outlined in blood crack
back her neck it snapped dagger down the spine
mine quick of breath sharp short sections across
the hairline down the chest ripslasb tear tearing
her skin away leaving her bared bared red and raw
the irritant scab exposed for the scar it was
a mere fantasy i realize it was fantastic drew back
the blanket i did incited yessir i was excited she
excited me the old in/ out and i was ready to make
my exit didn't want nothing to do w I her nossir
know that type -
in/ excite
exhale. counter joust parry thrust jet-propelled
tight rope it in slice it down right along the
competitive edge time to pick up the rapier and
sharpen it, tickle the ribs let's count the spaces
there's that one and there -
is that bone or skin?
only one way to find out ooo assert it in
exhale. breathe in slide back to square zero and
skip out again time to sharpen my erasure suspend
marginal misprint give and take no cramped
quarter, banging on the fucking radio, fucking,
getting up, fucking again in silence fuck fuck come
silence up and out where and when, waiting for
the money to run out and routine to descend.
the words had long since run out that coal new
year's nite. get me a glass of water she said don't
get pissed at yourself. i went to the bathroom,
finding and lighting a cigarette without bothering
to hit any switches. and just as i stepped in short i
stopped transfixed by the intruding cigarette's
reflection, a stare poking thru the mirror's cur-
tained dark. i pulled that cigarette from my mouth
i exhaled quick with force i blew it out but even
wf eyes closed wf eyes averted no escaping the
switch's masturbatory explosion, light splattering
and sticking, thrown pasted, violence on the tiles
glass filled, glazed eyes throbbing i watched them
drops cling linger a moment before slip slip
stealing away snapping snare slaps crisp pylon
loud mining the silence in the tempo of
resolution's serenade. i thought she said i thought
you were going to quit smoking. cig in band at the
hilt i stepped back. what does it take and bow
much one morning you wake up addicted the next
day the mirror's telling ya to quit was that the first
straw baby or is it the last she's past i mean
y'know sometimes it lasts all nite and sometimes it
takes all day but her, she just lasted one quick
take
Take I, an 8 X 10 glossy for the lawyer soon to be
salaried and then a few quick shots for the doctor
to come and then will, wrap it up clean sheets for
her a clean slate for me no, not a lurid episode
pornographic, well to a degree equally obscene for
us both the both of us ooo ooo baby BANANA/S
as then i look out a window out at the windows a
hundred mirrors in the building over there i look
out a window now and then does she lie yet
asleep, tight in bed? she left me impotent i left her
to go masturbate
below the perfect sink drop me in the water i'll
take a dive smooth muzzle/ d subfab sabotage

for the self-conscious person third the pursuit of
blank knowledge begins possessed of a proud,
passionate love and ends consumed in utter hatred
that he has attained his goal rests proven by
contempt.
the new journal, April 1979
the pure products of plato do all go hyperphrenic,
for if the Socratic dictum "know thyself" be thy
doctrine, the indifferent mirror bows in the dim
light before the altar ego. her rouged and distant
mystery lifts the hemlid of a seductive dawn. but
the puzzle/ d satisfied, the looking glass curses the
luke fluid dusk of these all top too curtained
desires. and empty'd between the day flames hell
translucid.
and the gazer whose faith would have him dwell in
hell's heaven, for him who would twist each whisp
of the spectrum inside out, for him for whom the
choice is not hard and soft-written in black on
white, for him for whom real be but one pole, the
pale end where fake becomes false and false fiction
and the faith that would deny heaven a hell, that
would the base rejoice and best detest, the faith
that would all less all unless, the faith that would
peer to the shiny pearl-handed reflecting pistol, the
faith that would suck the smoke and breathe a
blessure scrupulous and blessed
can such a mountainous faith be that and still be
damned bad?
then i will thrust my wriggling tongues in my
posscats and keep them there with my dirty fingers

straight-jacket beat my feet twitch my ears delete
what would you die for? a contradiction in terms?
lose yr sanity? and for a guaranteed annual
income would you choose lobotomy, or
castration? idle chatter of the impressionable who
so pursued the all in tiny tip-toed ad/ ventures
faith in the garden so kiss the will that would
allow the kite-span to fall and the leaves with
wings endow allure unmeasured holds out an
infinite until but let go drops
sifting hints of the tip at the end of the nose
behold hints insusceptible beyond pain beneath
pleasure blank leisure -
domain of the white
stained page-white listless and listening as the
leaves dead and dying twist to cry and flake from
the trees in swept decadent breeze clattering aloud
and underfoot
the lights split my shadow threw three one tall one
fading back the one up ahead outta reach her the
near quick one .can never overtake never meet
sifting hints slipping urban above floating charcoal
smoked evening orange pressed in air extinguished
or embittered alight that one telling moment, pain
or delight who could reply
these bony stragglers we see do they take wing or
track in abandoned shadows the vacant lot does
the cruel warbling return i must know who could
testify it's cold and i sense snow
who could testify walking in sleep another nite
another nite no safe sleep all my dreams broken
and closed who could testify
the red jacket vacuum cleaner who disturbed my
feet the manhole's sudden gush beneath the blue
cop club who rapped my chair to sleep who could
testify
walkin south where broadway hits on ftfth
plummeting above the deco windows went aqua
splashing the low thin light lying low like for on
the marne waterfall splashing spindly treefd there
in flat-iron square who could testify
walkin west to east down 14th the light blue above
cradling a crescent neon false too brite the deep
sea blue true at my back the dawn about to break
who could testify the flattened bags the forgotten
flyers swirling discarded outta luck in the curb by
the street the fresh cut twine from the early bird
edition i heard the wind whine and wheeze the
road closed right angles all my dreams weary of
sleep
who could testify the spastic his hand twisted tense
and turned up at the wrist resting hip on his
