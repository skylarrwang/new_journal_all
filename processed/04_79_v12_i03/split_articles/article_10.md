A student knocks at the door. 
"C~>Uld you please be quiet?" he says. "We're 
trymg to study next door." 
"We're sorry," we say ... We were just having a 
class." 

I am talking with another graduate student. 
" I caught a glimpse of your class the other day "

e says. You must have been having your end-of-
the-term party." 
We weren't.

The fact is, I'm terrible at parties. My mind 
goes blan~. I try to remember what other people 
do at parttes to have fun. I wonder which people 
in the room dislike me. I wonder how long it will 
be till I do or say something stupid. 

So when my classes started being mistaken for 
parties, I was as perplexed as anyone. I was also 
embarrassed. I reflected on this a lot: 
Why were they mistaken for parties? 
Because they were often loud and animated. 
Why were they loud and animated? 
Because lots of people participated. 
Why did lots of people participate? 
Because I did everything I could to arrange the 
right atmosphere for open, natural, but purpose-
ful discussions. 

And therefore I had no reason to be embarrassed. 
But I still was. 
When the students next door asked us to be 
quiet, we were summing up the major issues of the 
course. Issue summation is often done in this 
form: 
Teacher: What were the major issues of the 
course? OR 
Teacher: The major issues of the course were 
these: ... 
We were doing it a little differently. We were 
having an election for the most significant Western 
American personal narrative. Thoreau's "Walking" 
was winning over Twain's Roughing It. If Thoreau 
won, it meant that intellectual Westernness might 
be more significant than geographical Western-
ness. The discussion was, I guess, loud. It was also 
educational, and more fun than 99% of the parties 
I've been to. 

I am not an educational anarchist. I am devoted 
to books. I think they should be read carefully, 
and responded to carefully. I also think they 
provide incomparable common ground for 
celebration. 

Celebration? In classes? 
I am in church in New Britain, Ct., with a group of 
~ummers. After I have led a few games, a woman 
m the congregation says to me: "How do you get 
the ideas for games like that?" 
.. It's actually an occupational skill," J say. "I 
teach." 
"Oh the children must love those games," she 
says. 

Children? At Yale? 
Mummers? In church? 
You know that gold building at Wall and Church? 
You know across the street from that, the Trinity 
Parish House, where the National Humanities 
Institute used to be, where professors from all 
over the country spent three years designing new 
and innovating courses to reinvigorate the 
teaching of the humanities? Well, you know what's 
in the basement of the Trinity Parish House, at 
the foundation, so to speak, of the National 
Humanities Institute? 
Clowns. A bunch of clowns. Well, Mummers, to be 
exact. 

Mummer: One who mums. 
Mum: To play in a dumb show mask or 
disguise; specif. Eng., to go about' in disguise at 
Christmastide making merry. 
In April 1977 two great classes ended. The students 
prepared to go home for the summer. I prepared 
to wait until they came back. In a last ditch stand 
against four months of social atrophy, I got a New 
Haven Advocate and vowed to do three things I 
found in it. 

I went to a Senior Citizens' Old-Fashioned 
Band Concert in Edgewood Park. 
I went to an Open Psychodrama Session at the 
Center for Human Relations. 
I went to the basement of the Trinity Parish 
House and took a clown workshop. 

Nothing much came of the first two tries. The 
third may have changed my life. 
In the Mummers' Club we do all we can to 
revive what, in modern urban-industrial times, are 
recessive traits: trust, spontaneity, festivity. The 
Midway Project (Midway between what you can 
imagine and what you can do) works with the 
strategy of inviting people to choose a name, 
metaphor, costume, activity: a clown persona. 

On Wednesday nights, I am Professor Chatter-
ton, Chatty among intimates. My intimates are 
Chance, Time, Gusto, Solow, Aladden, Pjat, 
Futurity, Circh, Morna, Ping Pong, Irving, Alto, 
Pockets, Half and Half, Kiwi, Glow, Skye. With 
maybe a few exceptions, we have all seen 
psychiatrists, with individual problems ranging 
from writer's block (Professor Chatterton here) to 
fairly severe disabilities. (Not that writer's block, 
to a Ph.D. candidate, can't fall under the latter 
category.) An objective observer, looking at this 
group, would not say that the prospects for 
common ground were very great. This evaluation 
would say a lot about the limits of objective 
observing.

Lo~g before I took the clown workshop, my 
teachmg style was developed and functioning. 
What I got from the clowns was the vision and 
faith to back it up. 
A W~nesday Night Mummers' Club Warm-Up. 
Ingredtents: Hammered dulcimer music. 
Ten to twenty people. 
The Assignment: Keep moving. 

If you are lucky enough to be trained in the 
latest disco steps, and if you can figure out how to 
adapt them to the music, you are free to follow in 
Travolta's footsteps. You are also free to: Hop up 
and down. Jig. Skip. Run in place. Resurrect 
remembered dances of the golden junior high 
school years (the Jerk?). Swing your partner (any 
one of the I0-20 people can be considered your 
partner). Play mirror games. Join hands and go 
round the mulberry bush. You are also free to try 
any of these in combination. What it comes down 
to is that you are just that: free. 

In the midst of this, if you have any sort of 
addiction to introspection, you can think to 
yourself: I am having a wonderful time -
at no 
expense, with no artificial stimulants, with no 
ecological damage. And it's good exercise. 
Bein~ a Mu.mmer~ in the Midway style, is a way of 
keepmg ethtcally m shape. Events with Mummers 
develop moral faculties that might otherwise 
atrophy for lack of exercise. Each activity carries 
implicitly, this assignment: 

Respect the sacredness of human life. 
Find a way to value each individual. 
If you have talents, use them as communal 
resources. 
Learn to recognize miracles when you see them. 

If this sound religious, it is. One definition of 
celebrate: to observe or perform a religious 
ceremony. Midway Mummers celebrate life. Pro-
fessors and students celebrate learning (i.e., life) . 
And that, l"ve finally figured out, is why my 
classes seemed like celebrations.
