Fashion Forecast '79 
Beltloop groin grabbers. 
by Woolsey Grove 
Why wear your heart on your sleeve, when you 
can hang your soul from your beltloop? 
Communication is the key. When you're 
dancing with that new-found friend, there are just 
so many questions you'd like answered. (Is he a 
freshman? Does she give head? Will he wear my 
soiled panties?) But the music is too loud, and 
besides, those questions are just so hard to ask. 
And in today's quick-dancing, quick-food, quick-
sex society, no one wants to waste their time 
barking down the wrong alley. 
So let them know. Visually. Learn the code and 
fly your colors. Every top designer will be 
featuring these beltloop accessories in their spring 
collections. These fashions originated in (were 
stolen from) the gay communities of New York 
and San Francisco, where horny honchos hung 
colored hankies from back pockets and key rings 
from beltloops to signal sexual desires and 
deviances. This eliminated the need for the verbal 
communication which aU too often led only to 
disappointment and frustration. 
Now you too can enjoy the ease and impact of 
visual communication by "shooting from the hip." 
Try out these Ivy-League adaptations at your next 
mixer (Ladies, you'll have to wear pants again.) 
Just make sure you're wearing them on the correct 
side. Remember: on the left is what you've got to 
offer; on the right is what you're looking for. 
Hankies: Different colors mean different things in 
different places. At intercollegiate social affairs, fly 
your school colors in your left pocket. If you want 
to sample the offerings of other colleges, wear 
their colors in your right pocket. A Yale woman 
with a red hankie in her right pocket is looking 
for a Harvard man. A Yale man with an orange 
hankie in the right pocket is looking for a 
Princeton woman. A Yale woman with a green 
hankie in her right pocket is looking for a black 
eye. 
At Yale affairs the hankies have nothing to do 
with school colors, but instead adhere to the 
following code: 
Red 
In the left pocket: "rm having my period, so 
stay out of my pants, but let's talk and maybe you 
can get into my head." 
In the right pocket: "Frankly, I'm desperate, so I 
don't mind messy sex." 
Blue (seen mostly at alumni affairs, worn by either 
sex, and usually in the right pocket): 
"I am looking for a position as a domestic in the 
home of a wealthy Old Blue whom I will furnish 
with sexual favors in return for vast amounts of 
money and lots of free time to finish my novel." 
Yellow 
In the right pocket: "The only reason I come to these 
fraternity parties is because I like to watch fat sweaty 
jocks drink gallons of beer and piss it out in garbage 
cans. I want to follow you into the bathroom, watch 
you urinate in the sink, and let you take me on 
the slimy tile floor." 
In the left pocket: "The only reason I joined this 
fraternity is because I like to watch fat sweaty 
jocks drink gallons of beer and piss it out in 
garbage cans. After you girls go home, us guys 
who are left over go into the bathroom, piss in the 
sink, and take each other on the slimy tile floor." 
Green (as in money) 
In the left pocket: "The only reason I came to this 
mixer is because the Fence Club is being 
repainted, and I can't tell you which is worse -
the smell of the paint or the smell of the painters." 
In the right pocket: "I'm a music student from the 
Bronx on a full scholarship. My father is a baker. 
I'm looking for a rich preppie who plays hockey 
whom I can humiliate and eventually marry before 
I die of leukemia." 
KEY RINGS: Even the gays couldn't figure out 
what the key rings meant. Maybe left was 
dominant and right was passive, but nobody knew 
what the keys meant. We offer the following 
suggestions for Yale College: 
(Key rings are to be worn outside of the pants 
barging from the right or left belt loop.) 
11 
On the left side: How smart are you? Let 
everyone know by wearing your GPA. One key 
means your GPA is one, two your GPA is two, 
three it's three, and four you're probably a liar. 
For day-wear, end that embarrassing "what'ja get" 
syndrome by wearing aU four keys to class and 
removing the appropriate amount (if necessary) 
after you get back your paper or exam. 
On the right side: What year are you? Stop 
wasting everybody's time. Let them know before 
you dance with them. One key if you're a fresh-
man, up to four keys if you're a senior. Grad 
students should not be going to undergraduate 
mixers. 
Of course, hankies and key rings can be worn in 
combinations, but usually these are predictable. 
For instance, a guy with four keys hanging on the 
left, or one key on the right, will usually sport a 
red hankie in the right pocket. "I've never been 
with a woman before in my life, and I'm so 
desperate I don't mind messy sex. I don't even 
mind getting a 8 on my midterm on Monday." 
Other things besides keys lend themselves to 
beltloop wear and your special message. Attach 
them to your beltloop with a piece of leather 
rawhide. We particularly like the following: 
Hood ornaments: What kind of car do you 
drive? What kind of car would you like to ride in? 
What kind of car would you like to fuck in? Steal 
a hood ornament from the appropriate car and 
wear it on the appropriate side. Left if you've got 
the car, right if you're looking for a ride. 
A Swingline Stapler: "I just got my senior essay 
back from Tyco. It still has to be collated and 
stapled. This is a delicious moment for me and I 
would like to intensify it by having you sit under 
the desk and suck my cock/ eat my pussy while I 
do it." 
A cork screw: "Yve got a bottle of wine in my 
room. The good kind that you have to open with 
a corkscrew. Let's go up and drink it and when 
you're good and fried ru drill your skull." 
A can opener: "I belong to a fraternity and I 
have a case of beer in the car. Let's go out and 
drink it and then piss on the tires." 
A Dildo: "I'm a feminist. If you want to fuck 
me, you have to let me fuck. you first." 
A Skate K~y: On the left: "I want to take you 
back to the room and skate up and down your 
spine." On the right: "Only if you wear ice skates." 
A nail clipper: On the right: "Yve rented a Yale 
refrigerator for four years just to keep the butter 
from melting, and rve never had a chance to use 
it. After we dance this tango, will you come up to 
my room with me? Just don't tell me your name." 
A calculator (worn with polyster pants) On the 
right side: "rm a nerd. You don't want anything 
to do with me." On the left side: "I am a left-
handed nerd, and you don't want anything to do 
with me, either." 
So there they are folks, somethina for everyone. 
If your favorite bobby or fantasy has been left 
out, invent your own beltloop bangle. Yalies are 
great at interpreting symbols, especially English, 
Psychology, and History of Art majors, and 
they're the only ones worth going to bed with 
anyway. Happy hunting . . .
