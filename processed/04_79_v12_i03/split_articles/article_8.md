One Day in the Surreal 
by Jamie Romm 
(As the curtain rises, a man is alone onstage, pacing back and forth in an 
agitated manner. The scenery is vague.) 
MAN: (looking impatiently at his wrist, which yields no watch) Jesus, where 
is be? Well, I've had it! I can't wait around like this forever. I still have the 
capacity to act! I'm going to call him up and fmd out what's taking him so 
goddamn long. (Goes to a pay phone at the side of the stage, inserts coin, 
dials.) Hello? Information? Yes, I'd like the number of a Godot, G-0-D-0-T. 
Thank you. (Pause) No, operator, I don't have a fi.I'St name. No, I don't 
have an address either. (pause) What's that? You can't? Well bow many of 
them can there be? I see. Yes. Thanks anyway, operator. (Hangs up.) Damn 
those information operators! They always want you to know everything -
flrst names, addresses, social security numbers .... Don't they realize that 
our existence is dark and shadowy and obscured by nameless phantoms? We 
can't be expected to know anything! But try explaining that to an 
information operator and she'll laugh in your ear. If only I were Samuel 
Beckett -
then I could tell those information operators a thing or two. 
(Looks impatiently at his wrist, throws up his hands) Jesus, where is he? 
(Begins pacing again. A 2nd MAN enters, comes up quickly behind him, and 
tries to lift his head off.) 
MAN: Hey! What tb-
2nd MAN: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were a mannequin. 
MAN: Get out of here, you fag! 
2nd MAN: I am not! (exits) 
MAN: Goddamn arrogant queen! (Begins pacing again. A 3rd MAN enters. 
MAN stops him as be crosses.) 
MAN: Excuse me, do you have the time? 
3rd MAN: Ex post facto, my dear boy! Cogito ergo sum! 
MAN: Er .. . how do you mean? 
3rd MAN: Just look at the bank clock, friend! (points) It's that simple! In 
medias res! 
MAN: Yes, but are you sure that's the right time? 
3rd MAN: Why of course, of course! It's the profit motive, can't you see. If 
the bank clock reads the wrong time, the bank becomes mistrusted, and 
people take their business somewhere else. Time is money, money time -
it's that simple! Quod erat demonstrandum, boy -
that's the spirit. 
MAN: I see. Thank you very much. 
3rd MAN: Not at all, my friend. (Exits. A 4th MAN walks on, calling .. Hot 
dogs! Hot dogs! He carries a wooden ashtray on his bead.) 
MAN: Hey! You there! You haven't got any hot dogs! 
4th MAN: So what? Neither do you. 
MAN: Yes, but I'm not walking around shouting "hot dogs." 
4th MAN: rm not stopping you. 
MAN: (Annoyed) Well why the hell would you want to walk around 
shouting '"hot dogs" without any bot dogs? 
4th MAN: I was quoting. (Whips out a book, opens it) See? Act 3, Scene 2, 
line 5. "Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs." It's right here in the text. 
MAN: Sounds like a pretty stupid play to me. 
4th MAN: It's better than the one you're in. 
MAN: (Ignoring this) What's that you've got on your head? 
4th MAN: A wooden ashtray that ~urns, yei is no(consumed. 
MAN: (Interested) Is that right"! (.t'eers at ltJ now ..aucn you want for 1t? 
4th MAN: Eh, this ashtray's not for sale. It's priceless. It was once used by 
Jean-Paul Sartre. By the way, do you know the time? 
MAN: Just look at the bank clock. 
4th MAN: The bank clock? But that's the wrong time. (laughs hideously, 
exits) 
MAN: (pacing again) The wrong time! But that's impossible! What about 
the profit motive, and all that? Still -
if it were wrong -
even by a little bit 
-
that could throw everything off. That would explain why he's not here 
yet! Oh Jesus, where IS he? (pause) Why didn't I wear a watch? I never wear 
a watch. I don't even own a watch. I remember when I first learned about 
daylight savings, I decided to stop using watches -
if a group of legislators 
in Washington can change the time whenever they feel like it, then a watch 
is just a waste of money. Why, if a tyrant were to seize power, he could 
change the time at will to suit his own purposes ... Of course, then all the 
clocks and watches would have to be confiscated .... Everyone would 
wander around all day asking .. What time do you think it is?" u1 don't 
8:04 
the new journal, April 197~ 
know, what do you think?" .. Think it's lunchtime yet?" "I don't know, I 
can't tell" ... (suddenly realizes he bas been wandering, becomes angry). Oh 
God, when is he going to get here? (pause) Footsteps. That's all there are 
anymore, just one foot after another. Left, right, up, down, as we keep 
pondering it all, it all, it all, it all -
(5th MAN suddenly enters, inter-
rupts MAN) 
5th MAN: Excuse me, but were you just repeating the words "it all"? 
MAN: Yes, I guess I was. 
5th MAN: I see. My name is ... Mr. Zimbalist. 
MAN: (looking over 5th MAN's shoulder) My God, did you see that? 
5th MAN: See what? 
MAN: That bank clock! It just jumped from 8:03 to 8:05!â€¢1 swear I saw it! 
5th MAN: I don't see any bank clock. 
MAN: You're looking in the wrong direction, jerk! 
5th MAN: What do you mean? Which one is the right one? 
MAN: (excited) This one here! This is the right direction! 
5th MAN: Don't you think you're being a bit arbitrary? 
MAN: No, dammit! This is the right direction! 
5th MAN: (staring elsewhere) I like this one just fme. 
MAN: (recognizing something familiar) Say, who are you? Who sent you 
here? 
5th MAN: Sorry, but I must go. Toodles! (Skips off). 
MAN: (staring at bank clock) I swear I saw that thing jump from 8:03 to 
8:05! It's the damnedest thing. You can't just skip a whole minute like that! 
The clock must be wrong. Still -
what if it was right? What if that whole 
minute had just vanished? Would everything be different? Would everyone 
move ahead one minute, or stay the same? (Looks down at himself) I'm still 
in the same place .... but then I might have been standing here for that 
whole minute! What about a guy who was supposed to shoot himself exactly 
at 8:04- is he still alive, or did he just die a minute later? (6th MAN walks 
on; MAN stops him) 
MAN (pointing to clock) Excuse me, is that the time? 
6th MAN: Yes. 
MAN: (Doubting) The right time? 
6th MAN: I don't know what you mean. 
MAN: (emphatically) Is that the right time or not? 
6th MAN: That's the time! It's the only clock in town, and everyone goes by 
it! There's no question of right or wrong. 
MAN: You mean everyone goes by that time, and nothing else? 
6th MAN: Of course! And it's a damned good thing that Godot opened that 
bank, because -
MAN: Godot owns that bank? 
6th MAN: (suspiciously) Yes ... why do you ask? 
MAN: Just -
just curious. 
6th MAN: You're not from around here, are you? 
MAN: No. 
6th MAN: Well it might be best not to ask so many questions .... You've 
just made me miss the 8:04. Excuse me. (exits). (Pause as MAN watches him 
leave. Then, a 7th MAN enters, unlike the others, from the shadow at the 
back of the stage.) 
7th MAN: Excuse me, but are you the man being referred to here as 
"MAN"? 
MAN: Yes, are you Godot? 
7th MAN: No. He sent me. 
MAN: Well where the Hell is he? I've been waiting here for hours! 
7th MAN: He was here. He said he couldn't fmd you so be left. 
MAN: When was he here? 
7th MAN: 8:04. 
MAN: Ob God! 
7th MAN: Don't worry. He'll be back soon. He asked you to wait for him. 
MAN: Christ, I've already been here half a day! What am I supposed to do 
till he gets here? 
7th MAN: Here, read this. (Hands him a book, then steps silently back into 
the shadow.) 
MAN: (Opens book, reads aloud.) "Act One. Estragon, sitting on a low 
mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both hands, 
panting. He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again. Enter Vladimir. 
ESTRAGON: Nothing to be done .... " 
(Fade to black. Curtain.)
