EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Of all the various Yale facilities operated by members of Local 34, perhaps the most obscure is the Bethany Farm. Referred to simply as "The Farm," it is a 14-acre extension of the Yale School of Medicine located in Bethany, CT. 

Watching over the 30 animals residing at the farm is a caring man affectionately known as the "University Shepherd." An employee of the university for over 20 years and a union member since 1984, this Shepherd is the last of a staff that once included several farm workers. Of the two buildings in his charge, one is a barn filled with such classic farm animals as cows and sheep. These lovable creatures are used to make antibodies for immunological research. This is nothing new; the word "vaccine" can be traced back to the Latin "vacca" or cow, which was th e animal responsible for providing an antibody for fighting smallpox. 

The second building houses "purpose-bred" dogs and cats, animals raised and held in captivity until medical school researchers demand them for research and teaching. 

Although the Shepherd plans to honor the union strike, the farm will not be left without a Yale farmer. The Shepherd's supervisor will pinch-hit and rake over his employee's position. 

Yet, surely this supervisor is a busy man who will be juggling many different tasks during the strike. Even if he performs all of the necessary chores, business as usual on the farm assumes that there will be no open animal revolt. Although the university has established contingency plans to provide essential services in the event of a strike, it is difficult to anticipate what might happen if the animals, in a move of solidarity with their striking keeper, broke out to wreak havoc across the Bethany countryside. Perhaps animal union action would be more subtle: the cows and sheep might abstain from the production of antibodies, or the "purpose-bred" cats and dogs might try and find new "purposes" in an attempt to distance themselves from those for whom they were bred.
