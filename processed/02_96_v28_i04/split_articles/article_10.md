**Title: 1996 Labor Negotiations at Yale**

The 1984 drive for union recognition marked a watershed moment in the history of labor 
relations at Yale, a time that hangs over us today as a specter of former glory. This year's 
negotiations, while less glamorous than the universal fight for women's rights, has been no less 
dramatic. We have devoted this special issue to discussing the complexities of the 1996 
negotiating table. The difficulties emerge even more saliently against the background of the 
labor movement on a national level as well as at Yale. 

Labor activism at Yale over the past 15 years has coincided with a downward turn in the 
fortune of the movement nationwide. Corporate strategies focused on building cooperative 
relations between management and labor have arguably all but diminished the power of unions. 
Those wedded to the direct action approach for labor organizing have scoffed at 
management teams made up of workers in America's corporations. At stake is the future of 
unions' bargaining power during a time when corporations seem increasingly resistant to 
collective worker identity. Labor's strongest national voice, the AFL-CIO, has had to assess its 
role in reviving the labor movement. In this issue, Dan Murphy talks to AFL~CIO president 
John Sweeney to discuss his views on the future of labor activism and its impact on the current 
circumstances at Yale. 

As a university, Yale's relationship to its workers differs from that of corporations not bound 
by place or tradition. While other corporations can relocate in response to financial pressures, 
the university is much more rooted in its space. Yale's relationships with students, faculty, and 
workers is steeped in a tradition many would call paternalistic. Katherine Bell and Suzanne Kim 
focus on the political appeal of the clericals' and technicals' drive for union recognition in 1984 
and contrast it with today's union agenda, which has strayed from its original feminist stance. 
This year's negotiation struggle shows what happens when the field of bargaining opens up 
to the issues of race and class, in addition to gender. While gender predominated in 1984, this 
year, Locals 34 and 35 have had to grapple with added layers of worker identity. Yale's own 
preeminent labor historian David Montgomery writes in Th~ Fall of th~ Hous~ of Labor, 
"Although the personal bondings of families, migrant groups, young wage-earning women, 
craftsmen, strikers, voters, and rioters defined people's loyalties in different and often conflicting 
ways, all attachments were rooted in the shared presumption that individualism was appropriate 
only for the prosperous and wellborn." The collective actions of Locals 34 and 35 have 
challenged such presuppositions. Gabriel Snyder enters the actual office space shared by Locals 
34 and 35 to speak to the complexiry of building a coalition that is both politically 
representative and viable. Locals 34 and 35 have been trying to open up the terms of collective 
worker identity to include such previously marginalized groups as casual workers. Karen 
Jacobson compiles a dialogue of two casual workers' stories to contrast the administration's hard 
line. GESO has entered into the debate quite stridently by struggling to define teaching 
assistants as workers, challenging conventional notions of work in the university. Joel Burges 
analyzes GESO's relationship to a university resistant to recognizing it at the bargaining table. In 
an Afterthought to the issue, Professor of American Studies Michael Denning contends that the 
end of the grade strike does not mark total defeat for GESO, whose concerns will continue to 
prevail. 

In his book ~rk, Cuitur~, and Society in Industrializing America, labor scholar Herbert 
Gutman writes about workers' power to affect the development of their larger culture and 
society. A study of labor at Yale necessarily leads us to the impact that these struggles will have 
on the current state of labor affairs on the national level, especially in universities. Workers at 
Yal~om Locals 34 and 35 to casual workers and GESO--have the ability to change their 
roles in this university and at others. In a sense they are negotiating the terms of their working 
present and creating institutional history, a story that will speak to workers' movement after and 
beyond Yale.
