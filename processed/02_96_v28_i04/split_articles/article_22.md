EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I got involved my 
freshman year in a bunch 
of different groups. I 
have a boring litany of 
failures. 

The thing is there's little evidence to back 
this up. 

Students not already involved in these 
groups stew in th eir apathy. They are 
unaware when these groups coalesce and 
oblivious when they dissolve. They are out 
of the social protest loop. 

The apathetic become conscious of these 
groups only when their members are 
collec~ing signatures in the dining halls, 
when they're putting up posters, when their 
position statements are laid out in the Yale 
Daily New.f-when they're in protest mode. 

J
anuary 23, 1996. As the rhetoric from 
the unions and the admin istration 
mounts, SNS is moderating residential 
college discussions on issues involving the 
strike. Nick Allen, ·the SNS member 
running the night's discussion, strolls in five 
minutes late. Thirty minutes later no one 
the acronym wars. 
else has shown up. 

At the SNS meeting later that night on 
the second floor of Dwight H all, only 
eleven undergrads are present. Lamenting 
the low turnouts at the informational 
sessions, Lachman, who leads the meeting, 
rationalizes, "At least we got the message out 
that undergrads were talking about the 
strike." 

Discussion revolves around future plans. 
"Do we want to start working on PR 
this week?" Lachman asks. 
"Information," says Engler. 
Lachman 
corrects 
himself, 
"Information." 

Talk of information and organization 
dominates the meeting: restarting e-mail 
lists, making calls to SNS members who are 
out of the loop, assembling posters to hang 
around campus. A few central questions are 
repeatedly asked and answered: Who's going 
to. make the poster? Who can come to the 
meeting on Sunday? Who can call the 
phone list? Who can be at the service fair in 
Dwight Hall this week? 

Allen wonders whether they should 
form an official coalition for pro-union 
activities. 

A woman in a pro-choice t-shirr, who 
had remained silent up to this point, 
mentions that at the last meeting of the 
YPU's (Yale Political Union) Liberal Party, 
"They made a movement to be more 
. , 
acnve. 

Engler gets an idea a few minutes later 
suggesting, "Maybe we should restart the 
Social Justice Network?" 

Might as well get a few more groups to 
help organize, to spread information. 

February 1, 1996. Back at the rally. 
You would think that with all the 
emphasis on informing the public, the SNS 
platform would be a clearly articulated set of

Francis Engler (ES '96) contributes to yet 
another SNS strategy session. 

ideals, but you would be wrong. 

Francis Engler is still standing on a chair 
in front of Woodbridge Hall, speaking 
though a megaphone, outlining what SLAC 
is against: the two-tier wage system, 
increased subcontracting, the elimination of 
the alternate work program, and the casual 
worker program-under which homdess are 
given "exploitative" non-union short-term 
employment via a temp agency. He's 
especially against the casual worker 
program. This was originally a YHHAP 
protest, so this is a key issue. 

It seems like SLAC is finding a clear 
unified voice. Well it seems that way until 
coalition member and YHHAP Coordinator 
Dan Abraham (SM '98) goes and messed it 
all up again. He comments to a Yale Daily 
News reporter, "We're not taking a pro-
union srance. We're pro-worker and pro-
student." Not pro-union, just pro-worker. 
Oh. 

Puzzling over this morass of double-talk, 
thousands of students scratch their heads 
until blood is drawn. Once again members 
of the Yale Acronym Corps (YAC) have 
failed to state their positions with more 
clarity than the administration they attack 
for that very sin. 

It seems that abstraction has reached 
beyond the world of art and into the world 
of sound bites.
