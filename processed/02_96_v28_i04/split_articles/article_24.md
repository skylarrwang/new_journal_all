bottom up a remarkably inclusive and democratic organization that 
brought together a network of women, many of whom had never 
before considered themselves either feminist or pro-labor. 

In one of its trademark unconventional strategic moves, Local 
34 voted in March 1984 to accept a partial contract which resolved 
all non-economic issues while preserving the union's right to strike. 
But in September, after months of negotiations, two-thirds of Yale's 
C&Ts hit the picket lines, joined by Local 35. Linda Anderson, 
administrative assistant to the women's studies program, recalls that 
her initial feeling of humiliation on the picket line was quickly 
replaced by fierce pride. Two years after the strike, she wrote in the 
feminist journal Frontiers: "It was the kind of action that changed 
history, like the rallies, lobbying, and demonstrations to gain 
suffrage, or to win the legal right to abortion." 

In December, the unions voted to return to work temporarily to 
collect desperately needed wages before the holidays and to avoid 
the demoralization of picketing an empty campus during winter 
break. The new strike deadline was set for January 19, 1985 the day 
Local 35's contract would expire. But in late January, both unions 
successfully negotiated their contracts, narrowly avoiding another 
strike. 

Local 34's strike for recognition has been written into the 
history of the feminist movement as a pivotal labor dispute in the 
fight for the economic and symbolic acknowledgment of women's 
work. It rode the crest of 1970s feminism, arriving in the midst of a 
national debate over the legal issues of comparable worth and pay 
equiry. But it is worth questioning the origin of the feminist 
elements of the labor dispute. 

Nancy Con believes that the focus on economic discrimination 
against women arose from the C&Ts themselves, while faculty and 
students attached a more abstract and self-consciously feminist 
rhetoric to the labor dispute. Anderson agrees that union organizers 
did not explicitly employ the term feminist. But, she insists, "They 
were extremely diligent about talking about the economic 
discrimination against women and minorities." According to Molly 
Ladd-Taylor, Local 34's focus on grass-roots organization and small 
group discussions ensured that the union's concerns derived from 
the C&Ts themselves instead of from preconceived ideas of what 
women's issues should be. Anderson remembers a sense of intimacy 
and strength on the picket lines and at union rallies as the women of 
Local 34 began to experience female solidarity and empowerment 
whether or not they labeled their experience as feminist. 

As the strike wore on, its feminist elements drew more and more 
attention. Faculty and students seized on Local 34's fight as a 
practical point around which to organize political action, a real-life 
performance of academic feminism. "The union drive and strike 
were women's studies in practice," Anderson writes, "a chance to 
apply all that theory." Hundreds of sympathetic students walked the 
picket lines and anended rallies. Many refused to pay their spring 
tuition and sued the administration for breach of contract. The 
Women's Center distributed pro-union literature and took charge of 
moving more than 300 classes off campus. Homans recalls that 
about 100 faculty members held a demonstration every Monday 
afternoon during the strike. Faculry support reached far beyond 
New Haven. Hazel Carby, professor of American studies, and 
African-American studies, who taught at Wesleyan University at the 
time, participated in a network of support for Local 34 that spanned 
American academia. Even the Modern Language Association 
censured the universiry.

n an unseasonably cold March 8, 1984, 4,000 Local 34 
supporters gathered to celebrate International Women's Day 
in front of Woodbridge Hall where the Yale Corporation 
was scheduled to meet. 

Twelve years later, on February 2, 1996, Local 34 and 35 
members gathered outside another Yale Corporation meeting. This 
time, the weather was quite seasonably cold, the numbers fell far 
short of 4,000, and the placards and buttons calling for respect were 
noticeably absen~ Â· 

Local 34's rhetoric has changed drastically since 1984 when the ' 
drive for union recognition drew mass student and faculty support, 
creating a sense of shared purpose and female solidarity. This year's 
labor issues have failed to fall nicely into a clear morality play 
between good workers and a bad university-at least in the minds 
of many students and professors.
