Six weeks into the 1984 Yale clerical and technical workers' 
strike for union recognition, 52 female faculty members 
signed an open letter to the Yale community, in which they 
drew comparisons between their own disadvantaged position 
and that of the striking clerical and technical workers (C&Ts), 82 
percent of whom were women. At the time, women constituted no 
more than 15 percent of Yale's faculty, and only 15 women held 
tenured positions. 

C&Ts striving for union recognition struggled to reveal the 
university's race- and gender-based discriminatory practices against 
its employees. Molly Ladd-Taylor (GRD '86) argued in a 1985 
article in Ftminist Studits that the average C&T salary of $13,424, 
less than the minimum for a comparable position at Harvard, fell 
far short of the average salary of a male truck driver at Yale 
($18,470). Women not only received less pay than men for 
comparable work, but they also found themselves amassed in what 
Nancy Cott (Hon. MA '86), Woodward Professor of history and 
American studies, calls the "pink collar ghetto," clerical jobs with 
low wages and little chance of advancement. 

The 1984 faculty memo authored by Margaret Homans (PC 
'74, GRD '78), professor of English, then an associate professor of 
English, and Cott, then associate professor of history and American 
studies and chair of the three-year-old women's studies program, 
stated "The discrimination issue is unresolved. And so long as it 
remains so, undermines the con1idence and well-being of all women 
employed at Yale and reduces Yale's attractiveness as a workplace for 
women." To rectify the obvious gender segregation of occupation 
and wage discrimination, C&Ts demanded higher wages, increased 
benefits, and the right to collective bargaining and participation in 
decisions affecting their workplace. And female faculty, who had 
also encountered Yale's resistance to gender equity and its lack of 
symbolic and economic recognition of their work, firmly supponed 
them. 

In May 1983, Yale clerical and technical workers voted to create 
Local 34 in association with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees International Union (HERE) by a mere 39 votes. Almost 
a year later, more members voted to suike than had originally voted 
for the union. The C&Ts had succeeded in organizing from the
