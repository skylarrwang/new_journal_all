H
ey slackers, Generation X'ers, jaded summer waiters, 
video store employees, M1V zombies; boy, do we have a 
group for you. Clinically tested, aimed right at the 
upwardly mobile suburbanite, the urban sophisticate-
it's SLAC. 

Come on! Everybody's doin' it. 

In the midst of SLAC's first public rally on February 1, 1996, 
Francis Engler (ES '96), a veteran of the acrimonious acronym wars, 
rattles off the fearsome armada of groups who have found a place 
under the recently-raised SLAC umbrella: YHHAP (Y~e Hunger 
and Homelessness Action Project), SJN (Social Justice Network), 
YUDH (Yale University Dining Hall) Student Workers, SNS 
(Students for a Negotiated Settlement), and the Yale Women's. 
Center. Still, SLAC, as the Student Labor Action Coalition calls 
itself, has not approached its full potential. Engler proclaims, "In the 
future dozens of other srudent groups encompassing hundreds" will 
join the noble flock: SLAC claims its place as the newest in an ever 
expanding body of student action groups trying to change the 
world-and brainstorming really cool initials in the process. 

Within the alphabet soup of student groups, SLAC has A 
through Z just about covered. Yale is wimessing an acronym gestalt. 
Why, just yesterday they approached the YCC (Yale College 
Council) for support. Today, members of TUIB (Tangled Up in 
Blue) provide a folk music backdrop to the rally. When you can hear 
their rendition of Bob Dylan's "The Time's They are A-changing" 
above the din it's almost interesting, but you wish the songbook 
changed with the times. 

True, the cause is new-well the name is new-but Francis and 
his merry band of SLAC' ers have certainly been here before. In 
demanding that Yale cease its unjust treatment of unionized workers, 
SLAC reunites the veterans of activist coalitions of the past few 
years. 

Let the images of spring 1995's SCRAP 187 (Student Coalition 
Rallying Against Proposition 187) take hold. This broad-based 
coalition of student groups protested California's anti-immigrant 
referendum with vigor and vim. Bask in the memories of last year's 
other spurt of popular protest-you know, the one which fought the 
bursar's hold in fall 1994. They had it all-bullhorns, posterboard 
placards, and the support of another alphabet soup: BSAY (Black 
Student Alliance at Yale), RSF (Radical Student Front), Real 
Diversity, ISO (International Socialist Organization), and Poor at 
Yale (PAY, of course). 

Obviously this is the outgrowth of a wildly activist student body, 
20 
a seething mass at Yale hungry to 'Gverturn the Man (better known 
to some as the establishment, Pete Wt.lson, or the Bursar's Office). 
They are well-versed in the kindergarten alphabet song and protest 
chants with choruses of"Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho!" They are legion. 

Well okay, not really. 

The big problem is that there just aren't that many eager activists 
on campus. Nevertheless the faithful persevere. One thing is for sure: 
prior to the emergence of SLAC in the last week, SNS had led Yale's 
activists in their fight for fair union negotiations for years. 

Well sorta. 

"Do you mean to tell me SNS has survived all these years?" · 
asked Dan Heller (MC '86), a veteran of the first incarnation of 
Students for a Negotiated Settlement in 1984. That an activist group 
with such a narrow focus has emerged during every union 
negotiation in the years since the 1984-85 strike is truly odd. 

Of course, with four years separating each contract, the group 
has to start fresh each time out. SNS was first conjured up in the 
spring term of 1984 as Yale's clerical and technical workers dashed 
with the administration during negotiations for Local 34's first 
union contract. Formed mostly by Dwight Hall regulars, SNS tried 
to provide a neutral meeting place for students on both sides of the 
lSSUe. 


When Locals 34 and 35 went on strike that year, ending 
undergraduate access to bad cafeteria food, clean hallways, and 
showers free of soap scum, the campus became polarized. SNS 
changed from what Heller categorized "a student voice, a fact-
finding voice" into a "pro-union organization." This was not a 
difficult decision. 

Karin Cope (BK '85), one of SNS's founders,. said it best in an 
October 1984 issue of the Yak Daily N~s: "We basically put out 
some really stupid statements and petitions which basically said 
nothing because they were so careful in their neutrality." 


This is a lesson today's SNS refused to learn. 

D
ecember 12, 1995. Today is the closest thing yet to SNS's 
shining moment. As an SNS press release later recounts the 
day's events, "Students staged a lunch-hour 'Eat-in' where 
lines of student ate lunches out of brown paper bags to symbolize 
what students will be forced to do if there is a strike of university 
workers in January that closes the dining halls." 

Approaching Woodbridge at noon, though, there is but one 
plump, white-haired Yale police officer wrapped up in his 
department-issue winter suit, complete with fuzzy navy blue collar 
and official police cap with fuzzy ear flaps. He is standing vigil in 
front of the gates. Well, perhaps calling it a "vigil" is giving him, and 
the event, a bit too much credit. Whatever he's been doing, he has 
been doing it since 8:30 a.m. After four hours freezing in front of 
Woodbridge, he is probably not pleased with this assignment-the 
kind of work an officer might get in his final days of police 
employment. This officer is in post-doughnut mode. 

Instead of being faced with "lines of students," about ten 
students stand on either side of the policeman. Brown bags are 
conspicuously absent, and the only sign of a protest is four or five 
posterboard signs: "Stop playing games with our education;" "Bag 
the strike not our lunch. Keep the dining halls open." Typical 
protest fare. 

In the Woolsey Rotunda two SNS members present at the brown 
bag lunch protest are chatting, moments after exiting commons 
refreshed by a fulfilling meal. After 45 minutes the "protest" has 
dissolved, and the plump member of the YPD has departed. 

A similar scene is reenacted the next day. Despite SNS's claims 
that it has no leaders, only organizers, it's easy enough to figure out 
who's in charge: Nick Allen (DC '96), Susie Jakes (TC '97), and 
Francis Engler. At least these are the people to whom you go for 
information. They each estimate the group's size at about 40 
members with about 20 students making up the organizational core. 
This seems accurate given the event's attendance. Matters get more 
muddled when I hear that some of the students present are 
technically not SNS members but sympathizers from YHHAP and 
the UFW (United Farm Workers). 

On December 14, a day packed with protests by GESO 
(Graduate Employee and Student Organization) and Locals 34 and 
35 at HGS (Hall of Graduate Studies) and the Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions, the final day of SNS's eat-in is pretty 
much snowed out. The SNS press conference, which was to follow 
on the steps of Woodbridge, has moved to 
the common room of Dwight Hall. 
Even after pushing back the 
conference's start by 30 minutes, only 16 · 
people have made it into the common 
room-more than half are SNS leaders 
from the previous afternoon's protest. 
Four members of the local press sit in the 
back along with a lone stringer from the 
Associated Press, the only representative 
of the national media present. 

The event is filled with fiery position statements from various 
student groups. That is if you can figure out which organization 
each student represents. YHHAP representative Jamie Lachman (ES 
'97) also belongs to SNS. Yale UFW's Cedric de Leon (BR '96), 
speaks on behalf of UFW (but not officially; he hasn't gotten 
permission from the California headquarters yet). Jakes shows off a 
large billboard at the front of the room with over 600 signatures of 
Yale undergrads who signed SNS's petition. She later tells a Ntw 
Havm Rtgisttr reponer that SNS itself claims 60 to 70 ... trtembers 
with a core group of 30 to 40; either a huge membership drive has 
taken place over the last day, or something is amiss. 

After the numbers have been counted and acronyms have been • 
listed however, one truth becomes apparent: the 1995-96 version of 
SNS is hardly thriving. 

N
ick Allen doesn't have much pride in his extracurricular 
career at Yale. "I got involved my freshman year in a bunch 
of different groups," he said. "I have a boring litany of 
failures." While SNS's other leaders don't couch their previous 
activist experiences in terms of "failure," they too have participated 
in a host of now-defunct organizations. 

Senior leaders graduate, issues are resolved, the public or 
membership of a group loses interest and poof .. another group falls 
apart. Soon enough a new group starts. At first, it must seem odd 
that at each group's organizational meeting the same five or ten· 
people are the ones doing all the talking. It's probably disheartening · 
that the same ten or 20 people are always in the audience. 

Allen realizes this. "There's this perception out there that there's 
this little group of activists," he said, "We're a group that son ~of 
bears this out, but I have faith that there's a broad layer of people out 
there that are jusr silent because they're apathetic or whatever but 
they don't fundamentally disagree with what activists are doing."
