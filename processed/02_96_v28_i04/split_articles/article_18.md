GESO labors to define a

Blue Collar or Â·Blue Blazer? 
G 
ESO had reached its breaking point. On the evening of 
January 14, a portion of the membership of the Graduate 
Employees and Students Organization filled a classroom 
in William L. Harkness Hall. But that night, graduate 
students were not in WLH 119 to learn. They were there to vote. 
Corey Robin (GRD '96) stood. He read a statement expressing the 
leadership's admiration for the teaching assistants who had followed 
through on their commitment to the grade strike begun in 
December 1995. However, he explained, it was beginning to look as 
though the grade strike was driven by only a faction of GESO. The 
leadership recommended that the strike come to an end. 

When the floor opened for discussion, some members stressed 
the need to continue support for the three teaching assistants-
Diana Paton (GRD '99), Cynthia Young (GRD '98), and Nilanjana 
Dasgupta (GRD '98)-who had charges brought against them by 
David Davis, professor of history, Sara Suleri Goodyear, professor of 
English, and a member of the psychology department, respectively. 
Still others agreed that the strike should end. "Our first reaction to 
ending the strike was strongly opposed," Christopher Cobb (GRD 
'96) explains. "It was hard to get past that and reason through that 
we had much to lose and little to gain by continuing." 

Since December, a number of graduate students in GESO had 
considered the grade strike to be an ill-conceived and unethical 
course of action. Had GESO better prepared-perhaps even 
organized-undergraduates for the job action, feelings towards 
GESO might have been less hostile. Without undergraduate 
hostiliry, the argument goes, more graduate students would have 
been committed to upholding the grade strike. In the face of this 
adversiry, compounded by threats of administrative action, many 
graduate students turned in grades even though they had promised 
GESO they would not. The uniry of a group ostensibly acting 
collectively began to disintegrate, and what one graduate student 
called a "crisis of trust" came to a head that night in WLH as ballots 
were cast, and the grade strike carne to an end. 

"The meeting was extraordinary in every sense. Conversations 
were heated and heart-felt," Tom Thurston (GRD '96) says. "It was 
a very difficult decision to come to-my own position changed 
during the meeting." Thurston went into the meeting in favor of 
the strike's cancellation. He thought that they would then be able to 
walk out with Locals 34 and 35 if they voted to strike that Friday. In 
the course of the meeting, it became evident that the grade strike 
would end, but just what the end meant was unclear. About halfway 
through, Thurston realized that the leadership had no intention of 
recommending another job action so soon after the grade strike. He 
then decided to change his vote and cast his ballot in favor of 
continuing the grade strike. Although others may have arrived at the 
same conclusion as Thurston, some felt confused and angry by what 
they perceived as a sudden about-face on the part of the leadership. 

T
he impulse among graduate students to unionize and the 
factionalization that GESO experienced the ~ight of the 
emergency meeting both arise from problems inherent to the 
idea that students can also be workers. A myth circulates that Yale 
hires graduate students as teaching assistants to create a relationship

of mentor and apprentice between professor and student. Some 
graduate students argue that such a relationship is the invention of 
the administration, that the "myth of mentorship" is a misguided 
attempt by administrators to splinter "student" and "employee" 
into mutually exclusive categories. 

"To say that one cannot be simultaneously a student and an 
employee of the same institution makes as little sense as saying that 
one cannot be both a woman and black," Diana Paton contends. 
Thurston suggests that the reasoning behind the split is based upon 
a view of graduate students as people who are "just passing 
through," upon identifying them as "temporary residents." 

When detractors of GESO refer to Tom Thurston and other 
graduate students as academic transients, it bothers him: "I get tired 
of that," he says. "My daughter started kindergarten in the Hamden 
School District. She's in fifth grade now. We have roots in this 
community." Unlike many graduate students, Thurston has a 
history as a worker and feels he knows when he is working. From 
1978 to 1986, Thurston worked as a machine operator in a food 
processing plant in Los Angeles. He was also a shop steward for the 
Teamsters union for about four of the nine years that he worked in a 
California warehouse. He is not trying to claim that his working 
class background makes it immediately evident to him that what he 
does is work, but, rather, that his past experience in the workplace 
informs his belief that GESO should be recognized as a collective 
bargaining unit. 

Kathleen Clark (GRD '97), a leader in GESO, locates the seed 
of her dissatisfaction with her working conditions by emphasizing 
Yale's failure to construct a pedagogical relationship between 
graduate students and faculty. "I fail to see how learning precludes 
working," she says. "I have never encountered any evidence to 
support the claim that the primary purpose of my work as a TA is to 
contribute to my education." Her language also reveals an abstract, 
academic understanding of her situation. "When I have applied for 
jobs in the history department and the women's studies department, 
I have been asked to demonstrate my qualifications for teaching a 
particular course." She says, "I have never been asked, for example, 
'Which teaching opportunity do you think would best contribute to 
your education at Yale?' or 'What would you most like to learn 
about teaching?' There is no teaching requirement for my degree. I 
have never received any pedagogical instruction from a member of 
the faculty [about how to teach]." Clark's sense of herself as a 
worker coupled with her background among the cultural elite 
complicates her relationship to a drive for unionization. The 
complication comes from a pervasive image of intellectuals as 
upper-middle class and unionized laborers as working class. 

But the stories Clark and other graduate students tell suggest 
that the impulse to organize collectively may not depend on the 
socioeconomic class to which one belongs. Changes in the working 
conditions of any group may lead to unionization. 

"The experience that made it clearest to me that my teaching 
was work carne at the beginning of my fourth year. The year before 
I'd TA'd for the Shakespeare lecture both semesters," comments 
Christopher Cobb. "I decided I needed to broaden my teaching 
experience. So I listed 'Pope and Swift' and 'Milton' as my two top 
choices for the fall term." After the English department bumped 
him out of "Pope and Swift," he thought he might find room in 
"Milton" because there were too few TAs and too many students. 
But an associate director of undergraduate studies in the English 
department told him, at that point, that they needed him in the 
Shakespeare class once again. 

Cobb's story, like Clark's, suggests that teaching assistantships 
have nothing to do with mentorship, but, rather, the supply and 
demand of the academic marketplace we call shopping period. "I 
was doing a job because it needed to be done," Cobb remarks, "and 
any benefit that work had for me as training for my future career 
was only fortuitous." 

he impulse to organize and the problems it engenders found 
one culmination in the recent disciplinary hearings that 
Cynthia Young, Nilanjana Dasgupta, and Diana Paton faced.
