per day. Last week I worked 32 hours. I hope to get a job here, of 
course. What, cousin? Well, my man , I know you work 
construction and all, that gives you work startin' in March. Me~ 
there is nothing else. When the students go on break, we go on 
break. New Haven don't have no ot.her work. If I don't work here, 
I get no money, and I have three kids to feed. 
Rt: Union Organizing Activitits 
As many of you art awart ... Locals 34 and 35 of tht Fedtration 
of Univtrsity Employus have announced thtir intention to organize 
urtain of Ytzks casual tmpioyw for purpous of collective bargaining. 
Yeah~Â·~l'm a casual. Work here in the dining hall. Just hangin' 
out here to see if there's work. Been working here for 17 months. 
My man here has been a casual for three years. You know, I show 
up every morning, see if someone didn't show up for a shift. See, 
there are a lot of students working in the kitchen, and they don't 
show up. Or someone goes on vacation. Or gets sick. No, I don't 
know if I'll have work every day. Get usually 'bout 4 to 8 hours 
As part of their organizing activity, Locals 34 and 35 have 
~ attempted to solicit inurest in thtir unions by making dirtct visits to 
~ casual employus at their workplaces. Many of you have raiud 
J: 
qutstions about tht unions' activity. This mtmorandum is intentkd to 
~ 
I 
k 
o; 
answer the most common :Y as ed questions. 
:f i 
Qutstion: Must I talk to Local 34 organizers at work? 
Answtr: Absoluttly not. It is a violation of University policies for 
union organizers or others to inurftre with the work activitits of othtr 
t mpwyus. Thtrefore, if union organizers inttrftre with you during 
work timt, you should indicau that you are not on break and you 
wish to bt left alont. If union organizers approach you during your 
non-working timt, you should ful fru to talk to them or not, at your 
discrttion. l'Ou can ask organizm to leave you awne, and if they don't 
rtsptct your wishts, you should inform your supervisor immtdiattly. 


Did I sign a union card? Sure, why not. I mean, they asked 
me, and I want a job. But that don't mean nothing. I just want 
work. You're not tape recording this or nothin'? I don't care if you 
don't know my name, they might recognize my voice or 
something, and I can't lose this work. You're not recording? 0.1(. 
Yeah, I wouldn't cross the picket line. What, cuz? You'd cross the 
picket line? No, no, no, man, don't get me wrong, I don't want no 
strike. If there were a strike, I wouldn't get no pay. I wouldn't 
cross, but I don't know what I would do. I mean, I hav.e three kids 
to feed. 

Qutstion: What if union organizas attempt to contact mt at 
THE NEW JouRNAL 

home? 
Answer: Although union organizers can lawfully attempt to 
contact you at home, either in person or by telephone or mail, you 
have a right to privacy and you may refuse to deal with them. If they 
persist in bothering you, you may contact the University or New 
Haven police or bring the matter to the attention of Labor Relations. 

Come see me at home? I live nearby here, on Elm Street, a few 
blocks up. I couldn't do this job if I lived farther away. I have to 
come here everyday in the morning and all, so I just walk up here, 
come to the back of Branford. I wait to see the supervisor, see if 
there are any shifts. Or I get a call telling me there's work. Not 
just anybody can come off the street and be a casual. Had to go to 
Yale's Human Resources and fill out forms, so they know what I 
can do and that I want work. Hope to get a real job here someday, 
when there's an opening. It happens. Not often, but sometimes. 
What do I do here? Sister, we are everybody, we do everything. 
We done everything except cook the food. We casuals, we are 
better workers because we try a lot harder. Union workers, they 
set. They slack off because they have jobs. Not us. They say go 
sweep the floor, we sweep. They say go wash the dishes, we do. I 
get paid $9.06 an hour. That's not much money for everyone I'm 
supporting. Benefits? What? 

Question: Art union organizers allowed to pressure me even if I 
want nothing to do with the union? 
Answer: No. You have the legal right not to participate in union 
activities, which means that no one can lawfully pressure you to talk 
to them, to review literature, to explain your point of view, or 
anything elu. Moreover, no one can retaliate against you for 
participating in, or refusing to participate in, union activities. If you 
foe/ threatened or pressured by union organizing tactics, pkau "J'Ort 
the situation to your supervisor and to Labor Relations immediately. 
The University will investigate any threats and take appropriate 
action. 

No, I don't think nothin' is going to change. My man here has 
been working here three years. He ain't better off. Yeah, I've seen 
those pins people are wearing. "I don't want to strike but I will." 
Me, I got no choice. If there's no work, I don't know what I'll do. 
The union won't give me no money during a strike. 

Remember: You have a kgal right not to be pressured, harassed or 
intimidated by union organizers. If you have any questions at all, 
pkase ask your supervisor or call Labor Relations. 

Yes, I'm the dining hall manager. Usually casuals are just subs. 
Usually I'll call students first, then I'll call casuals. I call. No one 
should be here hanging out. If someone's hanging out I should be 
aware of it, and I will take care of it.
