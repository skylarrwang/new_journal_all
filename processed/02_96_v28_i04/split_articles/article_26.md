After the .Grade Strike 
n the weeks since the end of GESO's grade strike on January 15, 
a number of journalists, administrators and commentators have 
proclaimed the d~mise of Yale's gra~uate student union. B~t the 
reports of GESO s death are greatly exaggerated: GESO will not 
go away, and it is worth reflecting on the most recent skirmish in a 
battle which has lasted throughout the 1990s. 

The origins of the grade strike lie in more than six years of 
graduate student organizing, culminating in last April's vote by 
graduate students in the humanities and social sciences. In a ballot 
supervised by the League of Women Voters, two-thirds of the 1100 
eligible voters voted, and 78 percent voted for GESO as their 
collective bargaining agent. GESO won the support of an absolute 
majority of the graduate students in the humanities and social 
sciences, and no one--administration, faculty, or graduate students-
has publicly challenged the fairness of that secret ballot. 

In the eight months since the vote, the Yale administration simply 
reiterated its refusal to recognize the graduate student union, despite 
the fact that recognized graduate student unions exist at a dozen 
universities across the country, including the University of California 
at Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the University of 
Wisconsin. The administration's violation of the academic freedom 
and collective bargaining rights of the graduate teachers was based on 
the flimsy case that the standards recognized at peer public 
institutions were not applicable to private institutions like Yale. 

Thus, the GESO decision to conduct a grade strike was taken 
afrer much debate and soul searching; every other means had been 
tried and exhausted. There have been forums, petitions, marches, 
demonstrations, visits to members of the Yale Corporation, and brief 
teaching strikes. And the grade strike was a difficult and controversial 
action: I understand that both the decision to begin the strike and to 
end it were the subject of heated debate and the result of democratic 
procedures. 

Despite the often ignorant and hysterical response of Yale 
administrators and senior faculty, the grade strike was not an act of 
civil disobedience; it was a job action, the legal withholding of labor. 
And it was not a violation of a sacred responsibility. Indeed, on 
December 2, 1995-before the grade strike began-the Collective

Bargaining Congress of the American Association of University 
Professors (MUP) not only endorsed the graduate student union, but 
recognized grade strikes as a legitimate form of academic job action. 
In a resolution adopted by unanimous consent, they stated, "We . 
believe that all academic teaching staff, including graduate teachingÂ· 
assistants, have the right to collective bargaining, and we urge the 
members of the Yale University administration to honor this right. As 
members of a faculty union, we know that it is sometimes necessary 
to engage in job actions in order to achieve the goals of educational 
quality and workplace fairness. Those who participate in such 
efforts-whether a teaching strike, grading strike, or other academic 
job actions-do so not out of disrespect for education, but its 
opposite: out of a commitment to the value of teaching. We hope that 
such efforts will be respected, and in no case should they be the 
subject of academic reprisals. We urge our Yale colleagues to uphold 
these standards in the current unionization drive of Yale graduate 
teachers." The MUP has been a leading voice for academic freedom 
in this country for most of the century, and has often spoken out 
against university administrations that have violated the rights of 
teachers. The fact that GESO consulted the AAUP before their action 
speaks well of the thought and soul searching that went into their 
decision. 

The GESO teachers did everything to make this an orderly 
grading strike. They did their grading, and offered to write letters of 
recommendation for any undergraduate senior who needs fall grades 
for graduate or professional school applications. Their union set up a 
hot line for undergraduates who needed help. Many Yale faculty 
members quietly supported the grade strike by not turning in their 
teaching assistants. The teaching assistants and part-time acting 
instructors simply refused to turn in the grades to the university until 
negotiations began. 

Moreover, there were precedents for their action. In 1977, the 
Massachusetts Society of Professors conducted a grade snike in order 
to get the University of Massachusetts to negotiate in good faith. "No 
one took this decision lightly," University of MassachusettS history 
professor Bruce Laurie recalled in a recent letter. "As a result of the job 
action the administration began to negotiate in earnest. The Society
