is poorly"lit, but the mood is light thanks to 
Bob Proto. Dressed in jeans and a corduroy 
shirt, he leans against one file cabinet and 
jokes with the women in front of their 
computers. Though he is only a few yards 
away, his jokes are lost in the buzz of activity 
and the eternally ringing phone. 

While waiting in the chair by the 
receptionist's desk, your knees will jut out in 
front of the door. Most people walking in will 
probably say, as is common in the close 
confines of the union office, "excuse me," as 
they pass by. Laura Smith does this when she 
comes into the office. Dressed in more 
traditional business attire, she squeezes by to 
the IN/OUT board and slides her Tootsie 
Roll magnet to the IN column. The board 
only lists first names. Since there are 
apparently two Lauras in the office, Smith is 
listed as, "Laura S." Noticing her enter, Proto 
breaks away from his conversation and leads 
Smith into the open area of the hall. The 
heads of the two unions discuss a mundane 
matter next to the coat hooks. Rather than 
playing phone tag between separate offices, 
officials of each union run into each other in 
the hall. Lafer explains, "There's a lot of stuff 
that gets done by people walking by my desk 
or while walking down to the Xerox 
machine." 

f the mechanics of the alliance between the 
unions are calibrated in the halls, overall 
strategy is handled in more traditional 
meetings. After a day of fruitless contract 
negotiations, representatives of each union 
meet with Michad Boyle in the second floor 
meeting room. Today, the negotiating session 
only lasted 20 minutes and ended with a 
shouting match between Boy~e and Brian 
Tunney, university director for labor relations. 
Before the meeting begins, a list of attendees is 
lefr at the receptionist's desk. Matthew Walker 
(TO '85), research staff for the Hotel and 
Restaurant Workers, half-jokingly protests, 
"Why am I always put last?" The 11 people 
attending the meeting first crowd the hallway 
as the list is checked again; they then file into 
the meeting room. 

The physical relationship in the office has 
an influence on and reflects the political 
relationship of the three unions. As Lafer 
explains, "I think the alliance has gotten 
stronger over the years both between 34 and 
35 and between 34 and 35 and GESO 
because you just get to know people and see 
what they're like and see what their jobs are 
like.n 

Aside from the intimacy of the office, the 
relationship between Locals 34 and 35 is 
structurally encouraged by their joint contract 
negotiations. Of the university's demands, 
many are targeted at Local 35, such as the 
two-tier wage system and cut-backs in the 
alternate work program during the summer. 
Though the university has argued that it is 
not conspiring to 'bust' the unions, Chernoff 
sees the proposals as a move to "undermine 
the unions' existence on campus," particularly 
local 35. "Cerci.inly the university has gone 
after Local 35 with a bigger axe than they 
went after Local34," she says. Still the alliance 
plans to have Local 34 strike first. Chernoff 
explains, "We don't look at it as Local 34 is 
out and Local 35 is not. This is a strategic 
decision we made together." She continues, 
"Local 34 members understand extremely well 
that even if the axe isn't aimed at their neck 
right at this moment, or at least not in the 
same way, that they'll be next." 

W
en Chernoff says "we" she refers 
o Local34 and Local35. GESO's 
ole in the federation is still in 
question. When asked if Locals 34 and 35 see 
GESO becoming a full partner in the labor 
alliance, Chernoff answers, "Obviously, that is 
going to depend on what happens and what 
path GESO chooses to pursue." 

For now, that path is likely to be largely 
on its own. As Lafer explains, "Right now the 
main focus is the Local 34 and 35 contract." 
As for GESO, Chernoff explains, "They're not 
an issue on the table." She continues, "We 
made a big commitment to them a long time 
ago, and we're going to continue to suppon 
them, but they are also an independent 
organization." 

Without a contract or recogrution, Lafer 
emphasizes that GESO must be willing to 
fight for itsel£ "Each group is responsible for 
answerin~for themselves the question of 'Do 
you have the will to fight?' It's not that 
somebody else strikes for you, it's that 
somebody else respects the path you have put 
yourself on to strike." La.fer argues, "It doesn't 
make sense for GESO to go on strike now. 
Right now, in the aftermath of the grade strike, 
we have to regroup and pull together." But a 
yellowing poster still hangs above Robin 
Brown's desk: "Three Unions, Three 
Contracts. Loca134, Local35, GESO." 

e the College Street office creates 
intimacy among the leadership 
the unions, the rank-and-file 
members do not spend much time there. Lafer 
explains, "If you work in the same cramped 
little space with people, you get close to them." 
But he admits, "I think the leadership has 
more of this day-to-day closeness." T he 
alliance has sought to encourage bonds 
becween members with Saturday workshops 
that allow small groups of people from each 
organization to meet each other. Lafer admits, 
though, that fostering a close relationship on 
the rank and file level "is a slow process that 
happens over time." Lafer continues, "There 
are real differences between GESO and 34 and 
35, and the way the alliance works is not on 
the basis of trying to make everyone feel like 
we are all the same." Chernoff explains, "There 
is a common thread for us, and it's that were 
employees of the same employer and that sort 
of defines our community of interest." 

To remind the leadership who that 
employer is, taped next to the door leading to 
the stairwell, a life-sized head of university 
president Richard Levin yells, "More 
Ammo!"
