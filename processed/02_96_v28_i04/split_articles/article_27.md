in turn released the grades, 
and a fair settlement ensued." 
"The point I wish to stress," 
Professor Laurie wrote, "is 
that much to its credit the The Apri/6, 1995, GESO rally held outside Sterling Memorial Library. 
administration did not resort to reprisals." 
The Yale Administration's response was to turn to academic 
reprisal and intimidation. They singled out three teachers-Diana 
Paton (GRD '99), Cynthia Young (GRD '98), and Buju Dasgupta 
(GRD '98}-whose participation in the grade strike had been 
reported by senior professors, and began disciplinary proceedings. A 
lockout of the striking graduate teachers from spring semester courses 
was announced. President Levin told a Yale College faculty meeting 
that the faculty should work to separate graduate students from 
GESO, beginning a period of informal pressure from senior faculty 
advisors that continues to the present. 

However, since most of the grade strike took place while the 
university was on break, the university press did not cover the 
remarkable groundswell of support for GESO from professors across 
the country. Hundreds of faculty members wrote letters and signed 
petitions calling on Yale to recognize GESO and end its reprisals. Two 
of the largest professional associations, the Modern Language 
Association and the American Historical Association, passed 
resolutions condemning the administration's actions. 

Indeed the university's own Disciplinary Committee dismissed the 
serious charges against teachers--violating "a code of conduct that 
respeets the values and integrity of the academic community" -and 
found them "guilty" simply of disrupting university business and 
disobeying a professor. 

T
he decision to end the grade suike was a difficult one; the 
members of GESO had to weigh the disciplinary actions, the 
responses of other members of the university, and the ongoing 
negotiations with Locals 34 and 35. GESO's compromise proposal-
the call for a "memorandum of understanding" between the 
administration and the graduate student organization, and the 
withdrawal of the legal language of unions and contracts-was ruddy 
dismissed by the Provost, even though this is the compromise that 
many faculty have been looking for. 

Nonetheless, the fundamental issue remains: the right of graduate 
students to organize and their right to collective bargaining. How 
does the administration imagine Yale in three or five years? Do they 
really imagine that an independent graduate student organization will 
not be part of the landscape? As one colleague commented to me, the 
only way that could happen was if they stopped admitting graduate 
students until all public memory of GESO was erased. It is worth 
recalling that it took seventeen years for Yale's clerical and technical 
workers to win a union. From the 1967-68 organizing campaign of 
the Association of C&Ts to the 1984 strike of Local 34 of the 
Federation of University Employees, there were years of organizing 
against the determined opposition of the university administration. 

For the crucial issue in any social movement is not the particular 
tactic, the grade strike, nor even the momentary settlement, the 
contract, but the organization itself: the heart of GESO is the 
building and maintaining of a democratic, participatory organization 
which continues to represent the interests of graduate students and 
higher education generally. 

GESO's success lies in its own organization. GESO's presence at 
Yale has made all of us rethink our common sense assumptions about 
universities, and has contributed immeasurably to education at Yale 
over the last few years. It is time for faculty, undergraduates, and 
administrators to join the members of the Federation of University 
Employees and stand up for GESO. With all its successes and failures, 
it is as much a part of Yale as the English department, the 
Whiffenpoofs, or The New journal.
