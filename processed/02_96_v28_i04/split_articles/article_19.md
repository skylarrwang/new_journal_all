EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The April 6, 1995, GESO rally held outside Sterling Memorial Library. 
coalition like GESO organize against a 
common adversary, but with a shared sense 
of purpose and strategy in mind as well. 
Essentially, GESO needs to function 
collectively. 

This lack of collectivity has been a 
problem, some sources argue, because 
GESO has moved away from a democratic 
model to a vanguard one. The democratic 
model works from the bottom up. The 
vanguard functions from the top down, 
making decisions without always 
considering the opinions of its membership. 
One vanguard action by GE$0, one source 
believes, was the grade strike, in which at 
least a faction of the organization felt 
intimidated by organizers and leaders to 
participate. But the GESO leadership does 
not view its internal strategies to organize 
job actions as intimidating, suggests one 
source, because it has become so focused on 
fulfilling its demands immediately. There is 
no long term. The leadership wants 
everything tomorrow-a difficult task as 
GESO tries to negotiate such divergent and 
complex needs from family health care and 
medical coverage for same-sex couples to 
smaller sections and more teaching training. 
But the desire for 
immediate 
gratification makes sense in the context of 
GE$0, a young and largely middle class 
union. Historically, graduate students have 
come from the middle class, though there 
are certainly notable exceptions, and GESO 
has taken on a political project that has 
typically been a blue collar one. Blue collar 
unions have succeeded because they acted as 
collective, democratic units. Now it is time 
for GESO-what we might call a blue 
blazer union-to follow suit. 

Whether or not the leadership has 
completely abandoned the democratic 
model with which GESO began in 1987, 
many members are beginning to feel 
disaffected. The grade strike, a bold move 
to begin with, and its aftermath have 
hopefully taught GESO a lesson it could 
not learn in the classroom: the power of its 
membership to make or break an action. 

Fortunately, the central issue around which 
GESO formed-graduate student labor-
still drives the vision the organization is 
molding as it regroups and reorganizes in 
the aftermath of the grade strike that 
gripped the university for five weeks. 
Clark puts it this way: "I believe it is the 
task of my generation of scholars and 
teachers to organize, to secure decent 
conditions for what is becoming the bulk of 
our profession. I also recognize that it is 
young teachers and scholars like myself who 
have the most at stake. I don't expect any 
other group-either administrators or 
senior faculty-to take responsibility for 
securing what is, afrer all, our furure." IJI]
