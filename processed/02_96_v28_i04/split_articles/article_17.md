facing the effects of • lM--

corporate down-sizing, 
challenges from within, 
and a stagnant economy. 
The labor movement has turned 
to john Sweeney, the newly-elected president of the-American 
Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizatiom (AFL-CIO), 
to provide progressive leadership for the flagship coalition of the nations 
most powerfol unions by re-energizing grassroots organizing activity. 
The New Journal interviewed Sweeney three months into his term and 
asked him to comment on the significance of negotiations at Yale and 
the prospects for organized labor heading into the twenty-first century. 
TNJ: How did you first get involved in organized labor? 
Sweeney: My father, an Irish immigrant, was a bus driver in New 
York City. He was a member of the Transport Workers Union and 
as a child. I used to go with him to union meetings. Mike Quill 
headed up the Transport Workers then-he was a great leader with 
a wonderful Irish brogue. Anyway, I saw how my father's union 
helped him earn a decent living to support his family, how it 
helped him get dignity and respect at work, and how it helped him 
send his kids to college so we could enjoy a better life than he did. 
Coming out of college with an economics degree, I knew I wanted 
to do union work, but the first job I could get was with IBM for 
$90 a week. After a short time, I was offered a job as a rep with the 
International Garment Workers Union for $60 a week-and I 
jumped at the chance. Working on behalf of working men and 
women is the most rewarding job anybody could ever have, and I 
feel honored to get to do it. 
TNJ: What do you see as your most important accomplishments 
since your recent election to office, and what's on your agenda for 
the near future? 
Sweeney: It was very important for me, in the aftermath of the 
election, to heal the divisions that had developed and restore a 
sense of unity, and we've made good headway on that. It was also 
critical to begin immediately to put forward not just a vision but 
also a program for change, so that we could build to meet the huge 
challenges working families face, and I feel we've done that too. We 
immediately hired pretty much .. all new top staff, including a new 
General Counsel who knows how to use the law creatively to help 
build power for working families. We have a new government 
affairs team (politics and legislation), a new head of public affairs 
to build a program so that we can speak out forcefully for workers 
and their families, and a new director of organizing to begin the 
most important work of all-growing our movement.] In just a few 
months, we have involved some of the brightest staff leaders from 
more than 20 national unions in developing a blueprint for 
action ... And all of the top three officers have been traveling the 
country ~peaking to workers and leaders-out where we should be: 
TNJ: Is there a nationwide change in the character of union 
membership/leadership? 
· 
Sweeney: Work in the U.S. is not what it was just a few decades 
ago, with the dedine in manufacturing jobs and the rise of global 
corporations. There are more women in the workforce, more 
Latinos and other people of color. The faces of our leadership muse 
change to mirror our membership-bringing more women, people 
of color, and young people into our leadership. We made good 
progress at the convention in October, but much remains to be 
done at every level, and it js one of our highest priorities. 
TNJ: What is the role of white collar workers in the future of 
organized labor? How does the interaction between blue and white 
collar workers effect union strategy? 
Sweeney: White collar workers are no less anxious-and no less 
dumped on-than blue collar workers today. Since I was most 
recently president of the Service Employees International Union, 
which represents hundreds of thousands of white collar employees, 
I think I understand well why these workers will be an important 
part of the future of the labor movement. None of us will succeed 
unless we come together to succeed together. As I said in my 
acceptance speech at the convention, from high tech co hard hat, 
no matter what the color of your collar, this labor movement will 
be there for you. 
TNJ: Graduate students employed by Yale as instructors are 
attempting to unionize. What are the pros and cons of unionizing 
individuals in fields not traditionally perceived as union jobs (e.g. 
graduate student employees)? 
Sweeney: The advantages of unionizing workers in fields not 
traditionally perceived as union jobs are obvious-the greater 
leverage to win higher pay as well as rights, the greater respect that 
comes with having rightS guaranteed by contract, the opportunity 
to achieve solidarity among all classes of workers. In the end, of 
course, every union is just what irs members make it. I cannot see a 
disadvantage. 
TNJ: As the American economy changes, how will the role of 
unions at American universities change? Do you see colleges as one 
of the strongholds for organized labor? How do labor situations at 
colleges and other place-bound institutions differ from those in 
ordinary business? 
Sweeney: Since universities are "workplaces" where a certain level 
of decent treatment and mutual respect among employees and the 
employer have traditionally existed (unlike many other workplaces) 
then university employees are rypically among the first to react 
when they believe that standard, and" their trust, has been violated. 
So it is very likely that employees at colleges and universities will 
form unions if universities do not give them the respect they 
deserve. This is not really new-it's been happening at a 
quickening pace for the past 20 years. Often, once university 
employees establish a new position of respect through their unions, 
the kinds of partnership employees are able to enter into with 
management are among the strongest and most productive 
anywhere. 
TN]: It's been suggested that Yale is attempting to weaken Local 
35, Yale's oldest and strongest union, by reducing employee 
benefits and by using casual workers and sub-contractors. Do 
unions, particularly those at schools, face a legitimate threat of 
being crippled or even broken in the near future? 
Sweeney: Any union (and workforce) will be crippled if employers 
get away with exploiting their employees or replacing experienced, 
decently paid employees with poorly prepared and poorly paid 
employees. That's a fundamental attack on every employee, and 
unfortunately, it's increasingly common for employers to follow 
these short-term gains, long-term pain strategies. But workers 
together have tremendous strength, and it's the power of workers 
standing together against these threatS that protect them. 
TN]: Yale has proposed a two-tier wage system with a lower pay 
and benefit scale for new hires. What are the dangers of 
implementing such a system? 
Sweeney: A two-tier system is simply an invitation for employers to 
try even harder to replace more experienced, better paid employees 
with "cheaper" employees. It pits workers against workers, so it's 
the "classic divide-and-conquer" tactic. Ironically, where two-tier 
systems have been allowed to happen, they also work out badly for 
employers because they create such huge morale problems. 
TN]: Some students believe that Yale's workers are weakening Yale 
by demanding higher pay, threatening to strike, and bringing 
negative media attention to the university. How do Yale students 
benefit from the presence of a strong organized labor force on 
campus? 
Sweeney: If decent living standards and power for workers are a 
problem, bring them on! Seriously, how in the world would it 
"damage" Yale for its students to see that respect for work and for 
the importance of work are still valued in this society-and that 
some people are willing to stand up for it. Workers who have a 
voice in their jobs are more productive employees, and their 
workplaces gain because of it. 
TNJ: What possible roles do you see for Yale undergraduates 
concerned about the outcome of these labor negotiations? 
Sweeney: Fortunately, students have often been at the front of 
social change. Whether it's as basic as petitions to show support, 
participating in community outreach to build support or more 
creative tactics, students can be a powerful force. 
TN]: In 1984, Yale experienced a ten-week strike as irs clerical and 
technical workers fought for unionization. Did the national AFL-
CIO play a role in supporting Yale's unions at that time? In your 
opinion did that strike and subsequent unionization have 
ramifications for organized labor as a whole? 
Sweeney: The AFL-CIO supported that strike. The visibility of 
that strike was a huge boost to organized labor. It gave workers 
nationwide courage to see employees at a "glamorous" place like 
Yale stand up for their righrs .... We would welcome an opportunity 
to help if the Yale unions feel they need help from us. As I said 
earlier, solidarity is the only way any of us can be strong.
