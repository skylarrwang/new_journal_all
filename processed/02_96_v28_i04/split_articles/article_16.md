(above) Connie Tyrell, Durfee's Sweet Shop worker, 20 years with 
Yale, Local35 member. "Because of the way Yale is treating its 
dining hall workers, I am against Yale's proposed changes in the 
dining hall system. There is so much talent and potential in the 
Yale workforce. Yale doesn't need to go outside that." 
(right) Mike Keller, Yale University Art Gallery guard, 10 years 
with Yale, Local34 member. "I've been at Yale for ten years, and I 
lhzve worked very hard here. I don't like the idea of subcontracting. 
I think Yale should keep the job in the family. As long as they have 
a good bunch of workers, that's who the jobs should go to."

dining hall second cook, 13 years at Yale, 
Local35 member. "Yale has a moral 
obligation to the hundreds of people that it 
employs. we have given Yale the best years 
of our lives. How can Yale, which is not 
even taxed, say that it cannot afford a 
reasonable salary and benefits for its 
employees? I started here when I was 18 
years old. Now I have four kids, rent to 
pay, a car to maintain. I feel very strongly 
that Yale should not follow national trends 
such as downsizing. Yale should show 
respect for the people who have given Yale 
so much of their time and energy."

hall first cook, 22 years with Yale, Local35 
member. "I'll strike because a work action 
is our last resource for getting Yale to give 
its workers a decent contract."
