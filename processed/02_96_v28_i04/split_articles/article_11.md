**Title: A Tale of Two Tiers**

I know how a lot of Yale employees feel 
when they talk about not being respected 
by their employer. For the past two 
summers I've worked as a building janitor, 
a member of New York's Local 32B-32J of 
the Service Employees Union. I performed 
all your basic janitor tasks, like sweeping, 
mopping, moving furniture, and emptying 
garbage. For the most part, my co-workers 
and I were all treated with disdain by the 
"tenants," the executives and secretaries 
working in this Manhattan office building. 
Once these tenants found our that I 
was a Yale student, however, I meri.ted a 
kind of pseudo-respect. Though at first I 
was judged ignorant and lazy because I was 
a janitor, as a Yalie, I was immediately 
labeled trustworthy and brilliant. I was 
asked to help with computer problems, I 
was paid under the table to proofread 
business proposals, and I was even given 
box sears at a Yankee game to go out with a 
secretary's niece. 

My fellow janitors were generally not 
very well-educated. Some were dropouts, 
while some had done a few semesters at 
college. Working 40 hours of straight time, 
I netted upwards of $500 a week. For me, 
6 
that money meant 
I could buy my 
own books, beer, 
and food while 
putting something 
away for the future. 
For all my co-
workers, however, 
it meant that they 
could just barely 
keep their families 
in 
the 
lower 
middle class. 
I 
probably 
won't do the same 
job this summer 
because it won't be 
worth it. 
The 
building managers 
proposed a two-
tier wage system, similar to the one 
proposed at Yale, and I would fall into the 
second tier. That would mean that like all 
new hires, my pay and benefits would be 
set up on a lower scale. It might nor be 
worth cleaning garbage cans for only $470 
a week. 

32B-32J just ended a month of 
striking, fighting against this second tier. 
Until the very end, the strikers enjoyed 
little support from the general public and 
from other unions. Twenty years ago it 
would have been unthinkable that a union 
of 30,000 people could go on strike in a 
major union city like New York without 
causing a commotion. But business went 
on as usual. People were used to the idea of 
crossing picket lines and decided Â·that 
starving unions is 
an acceptable 
management tactic. Management main-
tained a positive public image while cutting 
down their unions. 

Are New York's janitors overpaid? 
Possibly. As a janitor, I made almost as 
much money as my mother, a veteran New 
York City School teacher with two master's 
degrees. But by the time my co-workers 
lost their money to taxes (I paid practically 
none as a student), union dues, and check-
cashing establishments (many didn't have 
bank accounts), they brought home about 
$300 a week. In New York, that much is 
needed just to remain in the lower middle 
class. 

At Yale, however, and across the 
country, it seems people are beginning to 
call into doubt the assumption that blue-
collar workers deserve to live in the lower 
middle 
When 
blue 
collar 
employment is a way of life, job security, 
decent wages, and decent benefits are more 
important than any free Yankee tickets or 
phony respect.

**Title: Yale's Brat Pack**
**Page number(s): 6-7**

When his mother and aunt showed up 
at his room on the first day of classes 
freshman year, Alejandro Montalvo (SM 
'99) realized he was going to have to make a 
few things clear. He asked his mother to act 
as if he were in another state and to give 
him advance notice if she wanted to visit 
him. Bumping into his mother around 
campus is a risk he faces every day. 

Alejandro lives in New Haven and has 
grown up in close contact with Yale. His 
mother works at Beinecke and is a Yale 
alum herself. And Alejandro is not alone in 
this predicament. A large faction of the 
children of Yale's faculty and staff end up at 
Yale. 

Aside from the obvious disadvantage of 
drunkenly bumping into the folks, there are 
benefits. These students have a unique 
perspective on the college experience. For 
years, they have heard what their parend 
think of the students they have to deal with 
all day, and now they get to hear the other 
side of the story. 

The odds of running into mom or dad, 
for the most part, are extremely slim. The 
offspring of union and faculty members 
rarely see their parents unless they make a 
conscious effort. The key lies in sitting 
down with the folks and clearly defining 
this new relationship. Adam Davis (TO 
'95), son of history professor David Davis, 
asked his parents to "understand that Yale is 
now my place." In the end, he says, he 
found himself "going home less than friends 
from California." 

Ben King (PC '96), son of Professor 
Robert King, an assistant professor at the 
Yale Child Study Center, avoided going 
home for the first few years. As a senior, 
however, he relishes the chance to venture 
home to do his laundry. "It weirds you out," 
he says, "you can go home and steal the 
couch or the fridge." 

Alejandro has an added complication in 
his life these days as a strike becomes 
increasingly likely. Although he supports his 
mother and believes that the strike is the 
right thing to do, he has made an effort to 
"distance his role as a student from his role 
as the son of a union member."What would 
be different if workers strike? "I would go 
home to eat and save some money," he says.
