It’s Thursday night, and that means Bingo at the Annex 
Club on the eastern side of New Haven’s harbor. The 
club was founded by Italian immigrants as a civic center 
for their community in 1938, but nowadays Bingo Night 
draws an ethnically diverse crowd of devotees. A woman in 
a blue hat with Bingomania written in rhinestone across 
the front and a man with a walker wait in a long line for 
concessions. In the large room where Bingo players wait 
at their tables for the game to begin, gold wallpaper and 
large mirrors fill the walls, and chandeliers dangle from 
the ceiling. A Bingo board lights up to announce lucky 
numbers, and the tables are covered with bottles of Dabbo 
Ink Dazzle, the high-tech version of Bingo chips. The 
Annex Club upgraded about ten years ago.
