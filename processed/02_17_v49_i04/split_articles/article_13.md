MAPPING A NEW HAVEN

A Yale senior builds an app to help refugees find resources

Hundreds of refugees scrambled into the United 
States in early February after a federal judge halted Pres­
ident Donald Trump’s ban. While the Trump adminis­
tration decides whether to appeal to the Supreme Court 
or rewrite the executive order altogether, people fleeing 
violence and persecution will continue trickling into the 
United States, seeking to build new lives from scratch.


But what will the more than two hundred and fifty 
thousand refugees already living here tell these new­
comers about American life? Where can they pray, buy 
familiar food, or obtain the proper job certification? 
What is here to help recent arrivals feel welcome?


According to Yale College senior Elena Hodges, not 
enough. And the resources that do exist are hard to find.


Hodges, a Political Science major, started working 
with an Iraqi refugee family, the Al-Mashhadanis, in 
Fair Haven in late 2015 through the Yale Refugee Proj­
ect. She quickly became close with the family’s seven 
children and saw firsthand the obstacles they faced. 
The children, who range in age from one-and-a-half to 
twenty years old, felt socially isolated. They struggled 
in school, finding it difficult to learn English along 
with algebra and American history. The family didn’t 
have a car, meaning the nearest Islamic center was for­
ty-five minutes away instead of fifteen.  


“That relationship just kind of got me thinking about 
why it is that people fall through the cracks in terms of 
accessing social services,” said Hodges. “New Haven has 
hundreds and hundreds of NGOs. But there are still a 
ton of people who aren’t getting access to those services.”


Part of the problem is that Integrated Refugee and 
Immigrant Services (IRIS), the nonprofit that reset­
tled the family Hodges knows as well as hundreds of 
others, has only six months to integrate refugees into 
new communities. After that, federal funding dries up 
quickly. IRIS receives sixty percent of its revenue in the 
form of federal grants, meaning it must adhere to fed­
eral guidelines that prioritize short-term resettlement 
over long-term support. IRIS executive director Chris 
George described the government’s traditional philos­
ophy as hasty.


“Just get them off to a good start, then pivot and wel­
come another family that’s coming tomorrow night,” 
he said.

anything she could address by writing a research paper. 
So for her Human Rights Scholars capstone project, 
she decided to develop something that the Al-Mashha­
danis could use to find services. 


She came up with the Resource Access Mapping 
Project (RAMP), a tool that refugees and other ser­
vice-seekers will eventually be able to access on their 
smartphones. Inspired by similar projects in Berlin, 
Vancouver, and New Orleans, RAMP marks the loca­
tion of every service provider relevant to refugees in 
New Haven, from soup kitchens and Goodwill stores 
to domestic violence shelters and mental health clin­
ics. It tells users whether a provider’s location is wheel­
chair accessible. It lists the documents users should 
bring with them in order to receive services. It comes 
in English, Spanish, and Arabic, offers a community 
rating system, and integrates with Google Maps so 
users can add a food pantry to their daily bus route. It 
even maintains a FAQ page on topics like community 
farming, as well as information about family-friendly 
recreational activities.


At least, Hodges hopes it will do all this eventually.


“As of now, this is all kind of conjecture and theory,” 
she said. “It’s not real yet.”


RAMP is still in its spreadsheet phase, sprawling 
across twenty-three columns and 447 rows. Hodges 
and a team of volunteers, including Yale undergradu­
ates and members of the Law and Medical schools, are 
working to make it a reality by the end of the semester 
using Kricket, an app aiming to create a crowdsourced, 
worldwide map of resources for refugees. 


Although the map’s first iteration will only come 
in English and will only display provider locations 
rather than integrating with other apps, it still reflects 
a semester’s worth of research. Hodges and her team 
combed through New Haven’s prisoner reentry guides, 
consulted with experts at Yale Medical School, and 
called provider after provider to confirm their hours, 
services, and accessibility. 


“My whole approach has been mostly to reach out to 
people who do the work in the community already, and 
to have it be made in communication with the people 
it’s targeted at,” she said. 


Hodges admits her project is limited: It can’t reverse 
restrictive immigration policies, for example. But she 
thinks RAMP has the potential to change the way peo­
ple think about refugee resettlement in addition to con­
necting refugees to the resources they need.


A guiding principle of RAMP is that, beyond having 
food in the pantry and clothes for the family, refugees 
deserve to live fulfilling lives. “‘Do I have employment 
that excites me? Am I leading a life that I actually care 
about, rather than just getting through another day?’…
That’s not something that there’s really support for,” 
Hodges said. She hopes making refugees more familiar 
with available resources will allow them to focus on 
other aspects of their lives. 


RAMP is welcome news to Joseph, a Congolese law­
yer and refugee who arrived in Connecticut last Octo­
ber. (He did not want his last name to be published.) 
After five years of interviews and security checks, all 
while bouncing between Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, and 
Kakuma, its second-largest refugee camp, he was able 
to make a permanent home in the U.S. 


Halfway through his six months with IRIS, Joseph 
has the basics down. IRIS shuttled him, his wife, and 
his three children to their new home on their first day 
in New Haven. His kids are in school, and he just got 
a job at a packaging supply store. He feels safe—even 
welcomed. He’s amazed that strangers on the bus say 
“bless you” when he sneezes. 


Yet his mental map of the city has holes. He wants 
to find cassava, a staple food in the Democratic Repub­
lic of Congo that’s hard to come by here. His children 
want to visit a zoo. With his IRIS-provided smartphone, 
he’s ready to use RAMP whenever it becomes available.


“It’s a good idea, a good idea,” he said. “Yes, yes, yes, 
yes. Because, you know, you have children, sometimes 
[it’s] not only good to bring them just to [the] library. 
The children like to know, to see animals, to see the 
mountains. It’s very, very good.”
