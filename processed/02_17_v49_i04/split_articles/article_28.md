herself at Yale—all while constantly monitoring the 
news for updates on Trump’s policies. Though she says 
her friends at school have been supportive since the 
election, most are not undocumented, and the people 
she worries about are not on campus. 

Since Trump’s election, New Haven’s status as a 
sanctuary city—which Mayor Toni Harp has repeat­
edly affirmed in recent weeks even in the face of fed­
eral funding cuts—has come to feel more significant 
to Corona Ortega, who moved here with her family 
nearly ten years ago. She spent most of her child­
hood over two-thousand miles away from her mother: 
While Corona Ortega and her brother stayed home 
with relatives in Puebla, Mexico, her mom worked 
in New Haven and sent money back to support them. 
After nearly a decade away, her mother moved back to 
Puebla to be with her children. But making ends meet 
was nearly impossible—she opened a series of baker­
ies that all failed. When Corona Ortega finished sixth 
grade, her mother told her that they wouldn’t be able 
to afford to send her to seventh; in Mexico, her school 
charged for uniforms and other mandatory services. 
But Corona Ortega was smart, her mother said, and 
deserved a better life than the one she’d had. They sold 
everything they owned to pay a coyote to help them 
make the journey to New Haven with Corona Ortega’s 
older brother and stepfather.

The Elm City’s designation as a sanctuary city kept 
them safe. Once, when her mother was driving Corona 
Ortega home from work in North Branford late one 
evening, a police officer stopped their car and asked to 
see her driver’s license. When Corona Ortega’s mother 
couldn’t produce one, the officer asked why she was driv­
ing without a license. “I have to work,” she responded. 
Corona Ortega recalls that the officer seemed to under­
stand immediately that she was undocumented—but 
the officer simply fined Corona Ortega’s mother and 
sent them on their way. On November 14, less than a 
week after the election, Mayor Toni Harp readied New 
Haven’s top lawyers to start preparing a legal defense 
in case Trump attacked New Haven—despite the fact 
that affirming its sanctuary distinction jeopardizes $56 
million of New Haven’s federal funding.

“New Haven residents have never questioned if I 
deserve an education or if my family deserved a job,” 
she told the crowd gathered at the vigil in January. 
“They’re fighting for people like me.”

According to Fatima Rojas, a volunteer with both 
ULA and JUNTA, fighting for the immigrant commu­
nity means fighting alongside them. After the election, 
both immigrant advocacy groups met with representa­
tives from City Hall to set up a working group to define 
what “sanctuary” will mean for New Haven. The group 
also includes representatives from the New Haven pub­
lic school district and the police department. Rojas, who 
is a member of the working group, says it has defined 
three principle aims: to strengthen the legal language 
of the police general order, to extend the sanctuary sta­
tus to New Haven public schools, and to create a legal 
document defining New Haven’s concept of a sanctu­
ary city, with help from the Immigration Legal Services 
Yale Law School clinic.

Since the election in November, attendance at ULA 
meetings has more than doubled—on the Monday 
after the inauguration, over fifty members of the New 
Haven immigrant community packed the folding chairs 
at the group’s Howe Street office. Children played on 
the floor as their parents looked to community lead­
ers for advice. Before the election, many came to the 
group for support in cases of housing discrimination, 
wage theft, and police brutality. Now, ULA co-founder 
John Jairo Lugo says that deportation is as real a threat 
as any. In recent weeks, ULA has worked with La Casa 
Cultural, the Latinx cultural center at Yale, to organize 
phone banking sessions to call local representatives, 
and Lugo says they’ve been inspired by the number 
of Yale students turning out to show their support at 
rallies. He’d like to see Yale’s administration extend 
support to immigrants in New Haven—given the uni­
versity’s clout, a public show of solidarity could provide

a powerful counter to the racism that Trump has legiti­
mized. But, he says, he’s not holding his breath.	

—
Rafael has not felt as anxious as Alejandra on campus 
or at home in rural Georgia. The path to Yale began 
when his parents left Aguascalientes, Mexico in 2001, 
determined to give their children access to education. 
According to the Pew Research center, the number of 
unauthorized immigrants from Mexico living in the 
United States rose steadily from 1995; the population 
peaked at 6.9 million new arrivals in 2007. Rafael and 
his parents came on legal visas and overstayed, join­
ing the American undocumented population over­
night. They followed his father’s friend to a small 
town in a Trump-voting county with cotton fields and 
pine groves, fast-food restaurants and a new Wal-Mart 
Supercenter, a single Catholic church and a handful 
of Hispanic families. Rafael’s four younger sisters were 
all born there, and they have all excelled in the town’s 
public schools. Rafael says going back to Mexico isn’t 
even a question. They live in Georgia. They’ll stay in 
Georgia. Most of their family is American.

After easily rising to the top of his middle school, 
Rafael spent the summer after his junior year in high 
school at the Georgia Governor’s Honors Program, 
the most prestigious academic summer program in 
the state. His success planted what he called “the idea 
of a Harvard” in his mind, and he focused his college 
search on prestigious private institutions. His teach­
ers encouraged him to apply out of state. He was that 
kind of student. But Rafael also had no other options 
— Georgia is one of three states nationwide that effec­
tively ban undocumented students from enrolling.  

When Obama created DACA in 2013, Rafael gained 
an immigration status that conferred practical and psy­
chological benefits. When he was admitted to Yale, his 
status was not much of a concern. To Rafael, being at 
Yale provides an imperfect sense of security. “I am not 
vulnerable in the sense that I have a Yale degree,” he 
said. “But I am vulnerable because some of the closest 
people to me are vulnerable, and there is nothing I can 
do to stop that.”

Jennifer Angarita, who graduated from Yale in 2010, 
remembers being undocumented at Yale in a pre-
DACA America. Now that she has a Green card, she 
remains engaged in immigration activism and orga­
nizing in Boston, and she spent much of her time at 
Yale involved with campus groups like MEChA and 
New Haven groups like JUNTA. Although the uni­
versity administrators were supportive and she found 
professors she could trust, she kept her immigration 
status close to her chest. In particular, she remembers 
Ann Kuhlman of OISS as an advocate, unwilling to 
make any public declarations but very sympathetic to 
what Angarita described as the “trauma of living as an 
undocumented student.” Now, Angarita and Dwight 
Hall director Peter Crumlish are discussing establish­
ing an advisory network for undocumented students 
to connect with undocumented alumni. Postgraduate 
opportunities are few and uncertain for undocumented 
students, and she wants to help establish an “under­
ground railroad” of professional and personal support. 
Today, it is safer and a little easier for undocumented 
students to move through the university, especially 
those protected by DACA. But there are still obstacles 
for completely undocumented students like Corona 
Ortega. For one thing, she’d like to work as a peer liai­
son at La Casa or as an aide in the Timothy Dwight 
College Office, but without DACA status, she’s not eli­
gible for employment by the university. In accordance 
with Yale’s need-blind admissions policy, Corona Orte­
ga’s tuition is covered by financial aid. But financial 
aid doesn’t cover the cost of textbooks, and she says her 
family needs the additional money she could bring in 
with a job. Her brother is in community college, and 
he and their mother both work as wait staff.

To some extent, Corona Ortega does feel protected 
by the Yale bubble: She says she doubts that ICE agents 
would come to Yale’s campus to physically detain her—
at least, she hopes that Yale wouldn’t allow them to. 
But after Trump’s executive orders, she worries about 
the possibility of a less dramatic encounter: returning 
to her suite one day to find that ICE had unceremoni­
ously left her a deportation order. She’s not confident 
that the Yale administration could, or would, prevent 
that from happening. In an email, Conroy wrote that 
law enforcement can only enter campus with a search 
warrant, and are required to check in with the Yale 
Police Department. If that worst-case scenario were to 
occur, Corona Ortega says she wouldn’t look to Yale 
for support. Her family has already contacted a lawyer. 
Garibaldo Valdez, the undocumented graduate stu­
dent in political science, says he thinks Yale’s decision

to discreetly publish its rejection of sanctuary campus 
designation was a politically savvy one.  According to 
the 2016 Annual Budget Report, Yale receives over 
$500 million in federal funding that supports seven­
ty-five percent of the research conducted on campus. 
Conroy dismissed the idea that any of Yale’s actions 
are influenced by the need to protect funding, writ­
ing: “Any speculation that Yale’s positions on undoc­
umented students and immigration is at all influenced 
by concern for federal research funding is completely 
unfounded and unfair.” 

Garibaldo Valdez doesn’t see the rejection as a com­
plete loss, though. Of the ten pillars of a sanctuary 
campus presented by the petition, the administration 
has at least partially implemented half: promising legal 
representation for students, appointing Ann Kuhlman 
to be a university liaison for undocumented students, 
forbidding police cooperation with ICE, and creating 
the OISS resource website. But Garibaldo Valdez says 
that these actions constitute only a small fraction of 
what the administration could do if it wanted to. 

“For a student who’s coming of age in the era of 
Trump, I am looking towards my institution, asking, 
‘What do you think?’” he said. “And the response hap­
pening right now from the student body is, ‘We are with 
you, you are a part of Yale.’ And from the administra­
tion, it’s ‘We’re kind of with you, but we don’t want to 
lose federal funding.”

Unlike Corona Ortega, Rafael chose to attend Yale 
without knowing much about New Haven or Yale’s his­
tory with DACA-mented students. When he came to 
New Haven in 2014, he had never seen the campus, 
and he is the only member of his family who has. Still, 
it feels like home.

For Rafael, Yale is about attaining his version of 
the American Dream. He’s staking out internships at 
places like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey Consulting, 
majoring in economics rather than psychology, his pas­
sion, to maximize his chances for economic success. 
At home in Georgia, switching easily between Span­
ish and English so his parents could understand, Rafael 
said he was lucky to have made it to Yale. “I’m on the 
successful side of the dream,” he said. “I’m fortunate 
for that. But at the same time, it’s a kind of an ideol­
ogy that keeps you going forward.” He wants to suc­
ceed financially, but he also wants to prove himself. 
“There’s a stereotype that’s continuously pushed — we 
aren’t contributing, we aren’t doing anything,” he said 
of American prejudices against undocumented His­
panic immigrants.

Of her son’s path, Rafael’s mother said, “Te tocó.” 
Rafael paused. “I don’t know how to translate that,” 
he said. “If I translated exactly… ‘it touched you’?”

He tried again. “She’s thankful for that and the fact 
that it worked out for me,” he said. “She doesn’t want 
it to sound like it’s been a gift. It’s something that you 
worked hard for but also, it’s lucky.”

Undocumented students like Rafael and Corona 
Ortega say they never take their place at Yale for 
granted. But they also say that as students here, they see 
themselves as full members of the Yale community—
defined not by the public statements of administrators 
but by the actions of their peers and professors. In that 
sense, they haven’t been disappointed.

Garibaldo Valdez agrees. Speaking at a Sanctuary 
Campus walk-out on November 16, standing in the 
very same spot where Alejandra would address the 
crowd two months later, he says he was shocked by the 
sense of security he felt.

“I have never imagined I could be in a university-reg­
ulated space where I don’t have to feel a certain degree 
of apprehension, not to say fear, to say my status,” he 
said. “And part of it is not due to the administrative 
benefits I’ve gotten, but it is due to the student body. 
And so the student body has made me feel like I am a 
part of Yale.”

The future remains unknowable; both Alejandra and 
Rafael move through Yale bearing the constant weight 
of uncertainty. But one thing is certain: The fate of 
undocumented immigrants at Yale will depend not 
only on Trump’s actions but the actions of their neigh­
bors on campus. If students keep attending rallies, call­
ing their senators, showing up—then sanctuary status 
could be authored by action instead of administrative 
declaration.

But Garibaldo Valdez would still welcome that 
administrative declaration. 

“It’s this feeling that I am a part of Yale, and you’re 
not treating me as such,” he said. “I mean, if one of 
your students were being threatened with this dark 
cloud of deportation, would you not go to the furthest 
extent to protect them? Would you not come up with 
things to do to make them feel safe? And I am seeing 
some of that. I wish I could see more of it.”
