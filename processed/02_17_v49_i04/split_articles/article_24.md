twice a week throughout his entire incarceration. She 
knew what he looked like from photos, but she never 
visited and they rarely spoke on the phone. He existed 
primarily within the words he wrote to her. The notes 
ran long—usually several lined pages, front and back. 
This was their medium, which rendered Scott not so 
different from a diary that wrote back. Jesilinett says 
she’s always felt comfortable telling her dad almost 
anything: aspirations, school stresses, relationship 
woes. Stuff she’d never tell her mom.


She grew up fantasizing about an old-fashioned 
father-daughter relationship. She wished he’d helped 
her with math homework she struggled with, given her 
boyfriend a hard time, or seen her off to prom. She 
wished he’d been there when she dropped out of high 
school because she was pregnant, and when her chil­
dren Lanie and Xavier were born. She wondered if he’d 
ever dance with her at her wedding. 


Then, all of a sudden, he wasn’t in prison anymore. 
She had plans to meet him at her grandmother’s house. 
But, unsure of how it would go, she almost bailed on 
the meet-up altogether. She couldn’t remember ever 
touching him before. What should she expect? Would 
it be better to keep their relationship encapsulated in 
its past state, without real-time verbal confusion to 
muddle it? But shortly after Scott opened the door to 
embrace her, Jesilinett realized she had nothing to fear. 
She and her father embraced and talked, and it felt nat­
ural. Their on-paper rapport carried into conversation. 
She left brimming with optimism and gratitude. Her 
father was home. Really home. A couple of weeks later, 
she brought her kids to a family birthday party, and they 
met their grandfather. Again, it felt as though things 
were cohering well, if a little surreally.


Her boyfriend had met her father before she did, 
because they were in prison together. He told her Scott 
talked a big game about “becoming a father” after 
getting out. But despite the first few happy reunions, 
Jesilinett began to feel like he wasn’t making good on 
his word. She rarely heard from him, and she wanted 
him to take greater initiative to be a part her life. She 
couldn’t get rid of the fear that maybe he wasn’t the 
father she’d been waiting for, that maybe he wasn’t 
much of a father at all. 


The first thing one notices about Scott Lewis are 
his high cheekbones and soft, brown eyes. These are 
also the first things one notices about Jesilinett (who, 
although twenty-six, looks like she might be sixteen). 
Her four-year-old, Xavier, has them, too.


Jesilinett and her kids live in West Haven in a sin­
gle-family home. She said she couldn’t bring much in 
the move, so she got rid of the collection of letters she’d 
gotten from her dad while he was in prison. 


Sitting in her kitchen, Jesilinett described how she’s 
felt since her dad came home. “It hurts,” she said.


Lanie, tugging at her mother’s jeans to show her 
a drawing, floated away, then returned with a paper 
towel roll. She wordlessly handed it to Jesilinett, who 
took a sheet to wipe her eyes. “I just wish he was more 
like a father. I wish he knew them,” she said, pointing 
towards the kids.


“I know him,” said Lanie, crossing her arms. “He 
picked me up. We played a game.”


“Yeah? What do you call him? What’s his name?” 
Jesilinett asked.


Lanie pursed her lips. She looked at her feet.


“Exactly.”


Fifteen-minute phone calls once a week or less con­
stituted Scott’s relationship with his sons, beginning 
when they were in preschool. Early on, he said, he 
stopped allowing his kids to visit. The humiliation of 
getting stripped, searched, and bossed around—and 
watching his kids go through metal detectors, get repri­
manded for moving the wrong way or attempting to do 
anything other than hold his hand across a table—“trig­
gered [him] psychologically.” And, unlike Jesilinett, 
Scott’s sons didn’t strike up a written correspondence.


Before he came home, Scott took his reunion with 
his children for granted. He thought it “would be a 
given; that it was natural, biological,” but he found that 
his kids had grown up without him in their lives and 
didn’t need him. 


A few months after Scott’s release, Scottie Jr. told his 
father as much. He didn’t feel any particular emotional 
connection to his father, and as a then-twenty-six-year-
old man with two kids of his own, he wasn’t seeking 
guidance from a stranger who’d been removed from 
society since 1995. 


“We’re biologically father and son, but in terms 
of everyday living, you really don’t know me,” Scott 
recalled his son saying. “You don’t know who I am.”

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Five months after his release, Jesilinett learned her 
dad was engaged to Rachel when an acquaintance 
mentioned it offhandedly in a Stop & Shop. She had 
no idea her father had been seeing someone. 


Incensed, she texted her sister Liz, who didn’t know 
either. They agreed: How did their father have the time 
to meet someone and get to know her, but not the time 
to mend and foster relationships with the family he 
already had? In his hurry to make up for lost time—
reconnect with a lost love, assemble a life, and partic­
ipate in a linear, traditional fatherhood—he had left 
them behind.


“He wasn’t only moving on. The whole thing felt like 
he was rubbing it in our faces,” Jesilinett said. 


Jesilinett “went off on him” over text. She told her 
father that she worried about the marriage. It seemed 
naïve not to acknowledge that Scott, who’d been wrong­
fully imprisoned for twenty years, stood to gain a great 
deal of money as compensation from the state. Was he 
sure that this woman’s motives were pure? 


Rachel, Scott’s fiancée, saw the messages and grew 
angry. When Harper-Rose was born about a year ago, 
Jesilinett decided to go see the family, but her relation­
ship with Rachel remained sour. Jesilinett left the hos­
pital in tears. Her dad had a new daughter and a new 
life with a woman who couldn’t stand her.


“He says he knew her before, that she helps him, 
gives him a house, that she loves him…” Jesilinett 
trailed off, waving her hand above her kitchen table.


“Blah, blah, blah,” her daughter Lanie finished.


How to Be a Father
Scott and Stefon attribute most of their post-prison 
successes to the new relationships they’ve forged, but 
both have struggled to connect with their now-adult 
children. Like Jesilinett, Stefon’s son Julian Sobin 
questioned his dad’s new relationship with Kimberly, 
and he considered skipping last year’s wedding party. 
He cried at the ceremony because it was an emotional 
day: wonderful, sure, but also difficult. He didn’t 
know Kimberly and, frankly, he hardly knew Stefon. 
He resented that his dad wasn’t trying harder to make 
things work with what he already had.


“It’s not like my mom wanted him back or anything,” 
Julian said. “But he has four kids with two women. Part 
of me was like, why does he have to join this new fam­
ily? Why couldn’t he make things work with a family 
he already had?” 


To her three kids, now all high school–aged  or 
older, Kimberly said Stefon’s been a fantastic stepfa­
ther. Julian, however, thinks his dad doesn’t really 
know how to be a parent. When Julian becomes a par­
ent, he says he hopes to emulate his mother: someone 
who was always there, who “would give the shirt off 
her back” and worked tirelessly for him and his twin 
brother Christian. 


Even though Julian knows his father didn’t commit 
the murders for which he went to prison, he’s always 
harbored resentment.


“If he’d been a good parent at the time—focusing 
on his kids or helping my mom, and not on getting 
involved in sketchy stuff—he would never have ended 
up in prison to begin with,” he explained. 


For a while, Julian thought about joining his local 
police force. During the preliminary stages at the train­
ing academy, they asked if he was related to anyone 
who’d been convicted of a crime, and he knew he’d 
have to bring up Stefon. He did, but also mentioned 
that he barely knew and almost never thought about his 
father, having been raised by his mother and grandpar­
ents. By any emotional measure, they were his parents. 


Christian feels that distance even more strongly—
which is ironic, Julian said, since Christian has so 
much in common with Stefon. They look alike, laugh 
alike, and exhibit the same rebellious streak. Growing 
up, Julian occasionally worried about Christian; he 
didn’t want him to end up like their dad.


The twins talked on the phone with Stefon occa­
sionally and visited every so often, but they didn’t like 
going to the prison. There were so many rules about 
how you could interact, and they were never sure 
how to make conversation. When they got older and 
had more control over their schedules, they went less 
regularly. Sometimes, if peers asked why his dad was 
never around, Julian would lie, saying he was away on 
business or always working. He was embarrassed. His 
friends’ parents weren’t in prison.


But when on a road trip with friends, Julian got the 
call that his dad would be free and began to sob. “The 
tears just started coming. I didn’t even know it was hap­
pening,” he said. “I just started imagining all the things 
he could be there for—if I ever get married, have kids.”

Julian didn’t know what to expect from their rela­
tionship after the release. The first time they met, he 
mostly felt shock, and that didn’t go away for a while. 
Now, he told me, they’re more like friends than father 
and son. He is reluctant to schedule time with his dad, 
who rarely takes the initiative. Sometimes, they go to 
the gym together, where they make small talk about 
girls or sports and work out alongside each other.


In December, after Julian graduated from Southern 
Connecticut State University, Stefon took him out for 
a drink. On the drive over, Julian told his dad that he 
didn’t feel like they knew each other, that he was angry, 
and that he wished his dad felt more like a father. Ste­
fon listened sympathetically, and Julian thought things 
might change. But after a few months, he said, they 
haven’t.


“They all come back from prison having found Jesus, 
which is cool, fine,” Julian added. “So I get a lot of 
Bible verse texts. But not a lot of ‘Hey, how are you? 
How’s your life?’ texts.” 


In Search of Lost Time
Unlike his half-sister Jesilinett, Tamaje—Scott’s 
youngest child from before prison—has a single early 
memory of his dad. He must have been around four, 
which puts Scottie Jr. around six. They were at Toys 
“R” Us, and Scott told them they could each pick 
out one thing. Tamaje impulsively grabbed a piece of 
candy, but later wished he’d followed Scottie’s lead and 
picked out a Hot Wheels car. 


A week after his most recent prison release, he sat 
at the kitchen table with his fiancée. Tamaje, like his 
father and Stefon, credits her, who visited him in prison 
every day for the last year, with helping him get straight 
and giving him a place to come home.


To an extent, he thinks having his father around 
might have kept him out of trouble—he went to prison 
for the first time for drug possession when he was fif­
teen—but he also doesn’t care to linger on hypothet­
icals. 


Now, Tamaje is feeling more optimistic about the 
future. Before, it seemed impossible to get a job and 
easy to go back to the street. But this time, his dad’s 
around and has a steady income, and he’s offered Tam­
aje a part-time position at Pike. He says he never felt his 
relationship with Scott was strained, because he never 
knew what he was missing. Now, he’s looking forward 
to building a personal and professional bond.


“Maybe it’s because I’ve been in myself,” he said. 
“But I get it. I don’t hold anything against him. He lost 
a lot of his life.”


Last March, Jesilinett turned twenty-six. Scott took 
her to IHOP in the morning. 


“Just to have breakfast together, for the first time 
ever,” she said, her voice cracking a little, “that was so 
special to me.”


Like Tamaje, she sometimes wonders whether things 
would have gone more smoothly if Scott had been 
around while she was growing up. He motivates her 
unlike anyone else, she says. After several starts and 
stops over seven years, she finally got her GED this 
summer, partially as a result of his prodding. Maybe 
that would have happened sooner had he been home. 


So, there at IHOP, they talked about her study 
schedule, her aspirations for a medical career, her life 
as a mother. They discovered that neither of them even 
likes breakfast food. It’s something they share, along 
with their high cheekbones, youthful brown eyes, and 
a tendency to get cold, both indoors and out.


“Like, all the time,” said Jesilinett, reaching for her 
jacket over their unfinished pancakes.


“Me too,” said Scott. “Have I told you about my first 
day out of prison?”
