meals with Carson, but he felt rebuffed. “After a cou­
ple early attempts to engage him, I spent the next four 
years smiling and saying ‘hi,’” Taylor said.

Dr. Edward Wassman ’73, a Davenport classmate 
who studied for chemistry and physics classes with Car­
son, remembered that Carson would sit near the front 
of lectures and often have conversations with peers or 
professors after class. Dr. Don Marshall ’73, a psychol­
ogy major in Branford, also remembers Carson readily 
participating in his classes. “I had a distinct impression 
of him saying things that he thought were really bril­
liant, that other people didn’t think were very good,” 
he said.

According to Walter Miller ’73, Carson’s fresh­
man-year roommate, Carson was disciplined and 
meticulously neat. He cleaved to a conservative sense 
of propriety; when Miller began sleeping with his girl­
friend on the couch, he sensed Carson’s disapproval. 
By senior year, Miller recognized Carson as one of 
the “nicest guys I knew,” but added, “You probably 
wouldn’t want to hang out with him, because you prob­
ably wouldn’t have that much fun.”

Though he identified as a Democrat, Carson was 
reticent about politics as a student at Yale, a fact made 
more pronounced by the swirl of political activism 
that defined the campus in the early nineteen-seven­
ties. During his freshman spring, tens of thousands of 
protesters flocked to New Haven for the high-profile 
trial of Bobby Seale, a founder of the Black Panther 
Party. Tensions continued as Yale adjusted to coeduca­
tion, beginning with Carson’s class, and Vietnam War 
protests swept across college campuses. Several of Car­
son’s classmates in Davenport, including former Bal­
timore mayor Kurt Schmoke ’71 and Senator Sherrod 
Brown ’74, Democrat of Ohio, were influential activ­
ists remembered for leading the student body through 
the protests. 

Henry Chauncey ’57, a former Secretary of the Uni­
versity who ran crisis management during the Bobby 
Seale trial, was surprised to learn that Carson was at 
Yale during the period. “I thought I knew every black 
student at Yale,” he said, referencing the heavy involve­
ment of African American students in the protests. Car­
son avoided participation. He was “a bit dismayed by 
the disruption of academics,” according to Wassman. 
Carson, speaking to The New Journal, acknowledged 
that he “really didn’t engage in a lot of political con­
versation.” Unlike Chauncey, he recalls a student body 
in which most people were frustrated by the turmoil. 
“I think everybody was a little bit dismayed during the 
Bobby Seale trial,” he said about the academic disrup­
tions, “so I don’t think that would be anything out of 
the ordinary.”

“Do you believe that everybody should own a home?” 
Senator Dean Heller of Nevada asked Ben Carson ’73 at 
his Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) in January.
“I believe that everyone should have the opportu­
nity to own a home,” responded Carson, raising his 
eyebrows and pausing after “opportunity.” During the 
hearing, he spoke at length about encouraging individ­
ual responsibility. He recounted, as he frequently does, 
how he grew up in an impoverished Detroit neighbor­
hood and rose to the top of his high school class before 
attending Yale.

Carson has taken a circuitous route into politics. 
A prominent neurosurgeon, he entered the political 
limelight with a controversial speech criticizing Pres­
ident Obama’s policies at the 2013 National Prayer 
Breakfast. Despite his lack of experience in politics or 
housing, he ran for president in 2016 and was recently 
selected by President Trump to lead HUD. 

But Carson, who now advocates conservative “com­
mon sense” government and denounces political cor­
rectness, was not always so outspoken. At Yale, he was a 
reclusive, devout pre-med student; few of his classmates 
would have guessed that he was on the path to become 
such a recognizable and divisive political figure.

Carson’s peers in Davenport College remember him 
as intensely focused on academics and not eager to 
develop friendships. In an era of counter-culture and 
protest, he stood out for his close-cropped hair, pocket 
protector, and high-water pants. According to his peers, 
he was an outlier. “No one knew him particularly well,” 
explained Ronald Taylor ’73, a classmate in Davenport. 
Early in their freshman year, Taylor sat down to a few

Carson expressed his beliefs more vocally in his 
church community, away from campus politics. Lola 
Nathan, who attended services with Carson at the Mt. 
Zion Seventh-day Adventist Church in Hamden, had 
him over for dinner regularly during his undergradu­
ate years. Over their meals, she would argue with him 
about everything from politics to current events. Inter­
viewed at Mt. Zion in January, she tersely remarked 
that she disagrees with him just as much now as she 
did then. 

On Carson’s prospects at HUD, his former friends 
and classmates are split along ideological lines. Some 
are hopeful about his foray into U.S. government. 
Terence Diggory ’73, a Davenport classmate who had 
a friendly relationship with Carson, said, “He has 
demonstrated that he is smart, and I’m sure right now 
he is doing a lot of homework.”

But many others are dismayed. Walter Miller seemed 
disappointed about Carson’s rise to conservative star­
dom. “He would be the last guy that you would think 
would be a politician.”
