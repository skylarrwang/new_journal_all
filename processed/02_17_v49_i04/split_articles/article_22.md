“The thing about winter is, when you’re not in it, you 
have a perception of how cold it is. But then, when you 
actually get in the cold, and you’re freezing your butt off, 
you don’t even remember what that perception was. For a 
second, you’re like, ‘take me back.’” 
At 5:30 a.m. on February 24, 2014, Scott Lewis took 
his first step as a civilian in more than twenty years. 
Ejected from a bus on the side of the road next to the 
New Haven Correctional Center on Whalley Avenue, 
he had only one set of clothes, which he was wearing, 
and a box of legal papers. He’d spent the majority of his 
time in prison toiling to get out: teaching himself the 
law, representing himself for nineteen years, methodi­
cally plodding though appeal after rejected appeal in 
order to shed his inmate number (137682) and escape 
from the 120-year sentence he’d been handed down for 
a crime he never committed.
When Scott took that first breath outside after the 
bus doors puffed open and he stepped onto the side­
walk, the air rushed hard at him. Most of his fellow citi­
zens were asleep, including his sister Marlo, scheduled 
to pick him up in three hours. He had no cell phone, 
no access to a phone booth—or the coins needed to 
activate it—and no coat. 
The bus chugged away. The sun would rise in an 
hour. His arms, carrying the box of legal papers, started 
to tremble.
