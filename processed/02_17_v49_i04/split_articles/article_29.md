1. Making a dignified entrance
You’ve made your first mistake: entering 
a dining hall without an eating partner. 
How did it end up like this? Just today, ten 
acquaintances inquired about grabbing a 
meal and catching up, but when you asked 
what time worked, they started sweating 
and fled. Weird. You don’t want to look like 
you’re trying too hard to find somebody, but 
if you don’t put in enough effort, you’ll end 
up sitting alone. You see Jimmy from Orgo. 
His notebook of chemical reactions is open 
next to his cup of Mountain Berry Blast Pow­
erade. If all else fails, Jimmy is always super 
down to talk about stereoisomeric relation­
ships and his overbearing parents. Before you 
enter the kitchen, you see two of your friends 
halfway through their meal. Last time you 
joined them, they wouldn’t leave until you 
finished. Not wanting to delay them, you ate 
so fast you choked on your beef and kimchi 
taco. Yikes. You avoid eye contact and head 
toward the line.


2. Rationing chicken tenders
You’re third in line for chicken tenders, 
and by the time you’re up, three remain. 
Normally, you’d take all three, probably 
more. Chicken tender day is a gluttonous 
celebration, and one or two doesn’t cut it. 
But there’s someone behind you. You don’t 
want to leave her with nothing, but at the 
same time, would she be happy with just 
one? She’ll likely take it, and then wait for 
more. The lone tender you left will be the 
coldest on her plate. You glance back, gaug­
ing her expression, and she smiles. It seemed 
like a genuine smile, but was it too genuine? 
Your legs begin to shake and you nearly lose 
control of the tender tongs. You take two. 
Not enough for you, not enough for her. As 
you walk to the sauce table, the dining hall 
staff whip out a fresh batch. It’s too late now 
to go back in line; you would be admitting 
defeat. You drizzle sweet and sour sauce on 
your plate in quiet resignation. 


3. Ordering a hamburger
You’re craving more meat, so you walk to 
the grill. The grill master looks at you, expect­
ing an order, but you’re not ready. It will take 
around seven minutes for the burger to cook. 
By that time, you’ll be seated, enveloped in a 
riveting conversation with your yet-to-be-de­
termined meal partner. Going back to grab 
your hamburger may stunt or even terminate 
your conversation. And what if the person 
you’re talking to just watched Food Inc. and 
is repulsed by the steaming hunk of meat on 
your plate? And don’t you think it’s kind of 
rude that you’re asking an employee to make 
you a hamburger when there’s plenty of pre­
pared food? And—“Excuse me,” the dining 
hall employee says, “Would you like a ham­
burger or not?” You notice that there are sev­
enteen people behind you.
“No thanks,” you say. You exit the kitchen 
and sit alone, fantasizing about red meat.


4. Scooping out ice cream
You grab the ice cream scooper out of the 
murky water, and flip open a metal top—
vanilla. You try another—raspberry. On the 
third try, you find an empty tub. No, wait: 
there’s three inches of rock-hard chocolate 
ice cream stuck to the bottom of the con­
tainer. You should have known that the 
Berkeley freezer would be set to an inappro­
priately low temperature, but there’s no use 
in having another dining hall meltdown. You 
don’t want Yale Security to pin you to the 
floor again. You get to work, reaching your 
entire arm into the freezer, digging into the 
ice cream with the world’s tiniest ice cream 
scooper. To get an adequate amount of ice 
cream, you’d need at least five or six more 
scoops, but you don’t have that kind of time. 
There is one person in line behind you, and 
you know that if you keep scooping, he’ll 
write an op-ed about how much he hates 
you. You get one last scoop into your to-go 
cup and steal a metal spoon because there 
are no to-go spoons. By the time you get back 
to your suite, the ice cream is melted. You 
drink it like a thin milkshake, which is a sad 
thing to drink alone.
