Dear readers, 

The magazine you hold is the most political 
collection of stories released by this year’s 
editorial board. As executive orders brought 
over a thousand people to demonstrate in 
front of Sterling Library and led protesters 
to block a nearby highway exit, our writers 
reported on Yale’s undocumented students, 
peace protesters who have stood on the 
same New Haven block every Sunday for 
years, a resource map for Elm City refugees, 
and the Yale alumni in Trump’s cabinet. Since 
its founding fifty years ago, The New Journal 
has documented how our classmates and 
neighbors participate in and respond to 
history as it unfolds. At this moment, many 
members of our community are resisting 
and grappling with a painful turn in American 
politics, and we are proud to tell their stories.

But many of the stories we told this year did 
not have their sights on the White House. 
We wrote about a freshman on the Yale 
football team who left campus in the dead 
of night to return home to Montana; a dramatic 
bear sighting near downtown; a Catholic theme 
park in Waterbury; and, in this issue, a teenager 
from Westport who is among the state’s most 
accomplished bird watchers. These stories 
were not about national politics. But by seri-
ously engaging with the portion of the world 
reachable by a bus from the New Haven Green, 
they make a political statement: There is value 
in learning about where you live and what 
concerns your neighbors.   

We leave the editorial board of The New 
Journal with the conviction that journalism can 
hold power accountable, support the means 
of social change, and honor those who make it 
happen. We also hope that this magazine has 
and will continue to make you feel present in 
this city—and inspire you to fight for the ability 
to feel at home.
Sincerely,
Elena Saavedra Buckley and Isabelle Taft, 
outgoing editors-in-chief
