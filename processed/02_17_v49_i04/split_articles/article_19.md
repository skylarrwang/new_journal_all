English course “Daily Themes.” Ross said this deci­
sion “saved me from the life of poverty,” a point he also 
made in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2010. After 
graduation, he packed his bags for Harvard Business 
School and eventually ascended to the upper echelons 
of Wall Street, where he became famous for flipping 
failing businesses. He said, “the only poetry I write now 
is occasionally for a friend’s birthday party. I’ll do a lit­
tle poem or something like that.”

Ross’s transformation into a financial titan and mem­
ber of Trump’s political circle, however, was not totally 
unexpected to some of his peers. A classmate who 
wished to remain anonymous said that during Ross’s 
time at Yale, “he was very clearly paying attention to 
where he could have most upward mobility.” Ross was 
the president of his fraternity, a platoon sergeant in the 
Air Force ROTC, and a member of an honors organi­
zation called the Yale Key. He sought out groups—and 
leadership positions in those groups—that allowed him 
to develop his personal standing and social network. 
“I believe he’s very aware of who he is and the reputa­
tional franchise he is trying to develop,” the classmate 
added. Ross argued there was nothing unique about his 
driven approach to college. “In those days, the work­
ing assumption of everybody that I knew in my home­
town was that you could do better than your family had 
done, and I think by and large that people did,” he said. 

In 2012, Ross was widely reported to be the “Grand 
Swipe,” or president, of Kappa Beta Phi, the secret fra­
ternity of Wall Street leaders whose members include 
former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and 
the former heads of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stea­
rns. Soon, he will likely enter one of the nation’s most 
prestigious societies: the United States Cabinet.

As a legacy student on scholarship who joined the 
establishment worlds of Yale and Wall Street, Ross 
could be cast as someone who understands the divide 
between disparate socioeconomic groups. Like Trump 
himself, the billionaire claims he will represent the 
interests of working-class Americans. “Middle class 
and lower middle class America has not really bene­
fited by the last ten to fifteen years of economic activity 
and they’re sick and tired of it and they want some­
thing different,” Ross said in an interview with CNBC 
in June. It remains to be seen whether the would-be 
writer turned corporate titan will be capable of provid­
ing something different.
