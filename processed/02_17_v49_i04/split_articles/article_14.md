EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
“With my eyes I blindly seek the breast: I want thick milk. 
No one taught me to want. But I already want. I’m lying 
with my eyes open looking at the ceiling. Inside is the dark­
ness. An I that pulses already forms. There are sunflowers. 
There is tall wheat. I is.” 
- Clarice Lispector, Água Viva
“Only afterwards does fear come, the pacification of fear, 
the denial of fear––in a word, civilization. Meanwhile, 
atop the naked table, the screaming slice of red water­
melon. I am grateful to my eyes that are still so frightened.” 
- Clarice Lispector, A Breath of Life 
“My mom loved breastfeeding,” Hayley said, 
cheeks aglow, on the sidewalk, beside the chapel, 
beside the cars in legion at the stoplight. Hayley 
is a friend of mine from college, rather magical, 
whose cheeks are ample and exquisitely rouged. Often it 
seems to me, in the sunset, that her face is the facsimile of 
an unbitten peach, lately fallen, in the grass. I want to talk 
to Hayley about peaches, but I stay quiet, because if I told 
her about her face, the fantasy would fade: it is ridiculous 
to tell a woman she looks like a peach. I was surprised, 
besides, to hear her mother loved breastfeeding, and 
raised my eyebrows. “Because it kept her thin,” she said. 
“She could eat five donuts a day and still have bruises on 
her collarbone, because she was so fragile.” So it wasn’t, 
it seems, that she loved breastfeeding Hayley in partic­
ular. Or perhaps she did, but all these years later, what 
occurred to her, in memoriam, was a felicitous side-effect 
of motherhood, that it stole the blood from your body, so 
to speak, and turned it into milk. Milk is the first taste we 
know on earth; our first taste is the taste of our mothers; 
before we steal the fruit from trees, before we press them 
into wine; before we cup our hands beside a stream; it 
precedes language, precedes our first word. But Hayley is 
now twenty-three: her mother has forgotten; it has been 
long since her daughter was a child. Now there is only 
the body, the aging body, the fear of the end of the body. 
Now her mother, when she speaks of food, speaks only in 
terms of fear. 

When Hayley speaks of milk, she is curious, almost 
enchanted, but this enchantment is a twin to fear—not 
of death, or age, but of the forfeiture of her feminin­
ity. “All of my friends had skim milk,” she said, “but 
my mom always bought whole milk, because she was 
obsessed with these studies that were coming out at the 
time.” The studies posited that skim milk induced pre­
mature breast development. “In third grade,” she went 
on, “I remember Jordan Tour had boobs and I didn’t 
and I really thought it was because her family fed her 
regular milk. I was so bitter about it. When my mom 
gave me money to buy milk at the store, I would buy 
skim milk and then play dumb, so I could have a gal­
lon of it on hand.” Hayley refused to submit; she was 
a frightened trickster, and she desired breasts. “This is 
bundled into my general anxieties about fertility,” she 
said. She wanted then, and still wants, to be a woman, 


wants to know what it means to be a woman, and fears 
that if one day she is bereft of milk, if she cannot be a 
mother— what, then, of womanhood? If she is to be 
barren, what are left but lipstick and aprons? Or if she 
is to dispense with those symbols, what then? Only per­
dition, perhaps—or perhaps, somewhere in that hereaf­
ter, she will grasp, at last, a fact.
Milk is a fact. But even so, she said, “I don’t 
understand how it works, it seems really mag­
ical to me.” Nor does she want to know. What 
she does know is that a peach is known by its 
nectar. If it is not sweet, it is only a reflec­
tion in the mirror. She has performed, has attempted to 
perform this or that face of femininity. Hayley became 
a postulant before the oven: she baked cookies and 
cakes. This was in high school, when she first asked the 
question, How does a woman speak? Because cakes are 
silent, cookies are silent, and what they offer in place of 
words are sweet nothings. Hayley wanted to be a sweet 
nothing: eyes declined, ears occluded by chestnut 
ringlets. She wanted to say: I love you. But a woman 
was circumscribed by a trellis of icing. A woman spoke 
without words, without gestures; a woman reduced her 
body to the shape of a scone; and when it was so small 
that it could be eaten in two bites, she offered it with 
cupped hands; she begged for alms, but not to be given, 
not to be given: she begged that they might take. Her 
body was a burden, too clumsy; her nearness to deli­
cacy only clarified the distance. So she baked; it was 
how a woman performed her quiet. Because a woman 
lacked the bones of a fish, the miniature splinters; she 
did not stick in the throat. Hayley wanted to vanish into 
her own revelation. 

But when she came to college, her scones said noth­
ing—not even quiet. A scone was made only for ques­
tions of tea; it could not answer questions of death. 
When placed beside death, a scone was absurd. She 
discarded her apron; if she was to be sweet, it would 
have to be a matter of words. But she did not want to 
be sweet, unless sweetness was the means by which she 
beguiled you, or beguiled, perhaps, herself. It was diffi­
cult to delineate desire. “I don’t want to wear make-up 
just to please a guy,” she said, “but I don’t want to not 
wear make-up because I’m afraid of what that will sig­
nal to the world.” Either way, hers would no longer be 
an innocent offering. “I like skirts, I like high heels, 
and I don’t think there’s a problem with that.” When 
she walked into the kitchen, it was not because she 
needed sugar.  Nor because she needed to escape into 
a diorama.  Nor because she wanted the purity of a defi­
nition.  Now she fell into the kitchen like a slant of light.  
Now, whether she wore lipstick on the sidewalk—
whether the public world, in the matter of desire, was a 
hall of mirrors—the kitchen was a respite, a bare-footed 
bakery. She no longer made her scones as an offering of 
love, or at least, not to you or me. Because every scone 
she baked arrived on her own plate. The crumbs left on 
her table are evidence of an intimacy. 

Last week, the heat was relentless; 
summer in New Haven is unforgiving, 
so I stopped into Hayley’s apartment to 
say hello and rest my feet. I wanted to lend 
her a book of essays, Little Labors by Rivka 
Galchen, and show her my new lipstick. But 
when I arrived at her kitchen, I did not pass beyond the 
doorframe: I did not want to interrupt. I had arrived at 
a scene, not so much of a crime, as of beauty—though 
there was, within this beauty, a quality of trespass. Hayley 
was slicing watermelon. She dropped each slice with an 
air of distracted elegance into an alabaster bowl, hum­
ming, meanwhile, some soft tune. Then, noticing me, 
she turned around. “Oh hi,” she said, “welcome.” In her 
other hand was a bright kitchen knife, larger than what is 
so-called strictly necessary. She held it with her wrist limp, 
as a child might hold a lollipop—but she was far more 
languorous than a child, and just as daring. Which is to 
say, she held it as if violence belonged to her no less than 
elegance. If a woman could wield a spatula, so she could 
wield a blade. But when she saw my eyes, she laughed. 
“You are just the sort of person who would find this 
romantic,” she said. “I thought about that while you were 
climbing the stairs.” 

Even carelessness is a performance. Hers was a per­
formance for both of us, on a summer day, in the mid­
dle of New Haven. And in the middle of New Haven, 
she had managed, at last, to surpass her innocence—or 
to arrive at a more ancient innocence. She was, for the 
length of a glance, as old as the Stone Age. But a glance 
is all we’re given. 

In a week or two, Hayley will move to Los Angeles, 
to begin, as they say, a new life. But for now, in the 
summer, even if she does not know what a woman is, 
she knows what a woman can do. A woman can split 
apart her sweetness. And discover, inside the skin of a 
watermelon, a new word.
