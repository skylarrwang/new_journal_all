ing New Haven, reactions to criticisms of these policies 
are not all positive. Sometimes people wave in support. 
Sometimes they give them the finger. Regardless, the 
women’s aims remain lofty, their dedication unfailing. 
“My goal would be to live in a country with a govern­
ment in which everyone is respected,” Klein said. “I 
expect to be vigiling for the rest of my life.”
At around 12:45 p.m., a man drives by on a yellow 
motorcycle, blasting Wiz Khalifa and honking enthusi­
astically. The driver of a Mercedes gives them a thumbs 
up. Klein is bemused.
“This has been among the most positive responses 
we’ve ever had. I wonder if the inauguration and the 
demonstrations have something to do with it.” She 
pauses. “Maybe I could allow a little optimism to filter 
into my consciousness.”
A few minutes before the women head home, a man 
wearing wire-rimmed glasses and a green cap shuffles 
up to the corner. Klein hands him a flier, and he begins 
speaking animatedly. “I’ve got a couple Vietnam but­
tons,” he said. “Lot of my friends didn’t make it back. 
Sometimes I get nightmares. It really scares the hell 
out of me. I’ve seen people killing women and chil­
dren, and I still remember all of that.” His voice rises. 
“It makes me sick!”
“And it’s still going on,” Klein says.
They chat for a few more minutes. “Talking to you 
made me feel better,” the man says. He and Klein 
shake hands.
McGovern and Panzarella leave at one. Klein folds 
up the sign. “The vigil is not only important for the 
people who pass by,” she says, stuffing the last few fliers 
into her fanny pack. “It’s important for us, too. On the 
weeks I can’t come, the rest of the week doesn’t feel 
right.” The women recognize they aren’t agents of seis­
mic change. All they try to do is get people to look up 
from their phones, stop for a second, and think.
Klein walks back down Broadway, heading home. 
The island is empty. Pedestrians stroll along. Cars 
speed by. War goes on.
