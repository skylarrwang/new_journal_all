Wilbur Ross ’59 has been dubbed the “king of bank­
ruptcy” by Fortune magazine. Over the past fifteen years, 
he has made billions of dollars by capitalizing on failing 
American steel, coal, and textile companies. He made 
his way into President Trump’s inner circle in the nine­
teen-nineties by rescuing him from the Trump Taj Mahal 
debacle, when Trump struggled to make debt payments 
for the Taj Mahal casino just a year after purchasing it. 
Today, he’s the nominee for the United States Secretary 
of Commerce. 

Sixty years ago, though, he was “Wilbo.” In the 
era of mandatory coat and tie, he moseyed about the 
Jonathan Edwards College courtyard in a baggy crew­
neck sweater. According to Kerry Wood ’59 who lived 
upstairs from him for three years, Ross gained the nick­
name “Stinky” because of his heavy aftershave. “If he 
had too much cologne, it was because he wasn’t show­
ering adequately,” said Dan Harris ’59, another mem­
ber of Ross’s JE class. “Wilbur, to be generous, at the 
time was a slob,” he added. “A nice guy, but a slob.” In 
an interview with The New Journal, Ross claimed that 
the nickname “Stinky” belonged not to him but rather 
his freshman year roommate. 

In the late nineteen-fifties, Yale’s culture pressured 
students to obey a conservative prep school style of 
dress. Fred Oser ’58 describes the campus in a sin­
gle sentence: “I was completely overwhelmed by the 
atmosphere of conformity.” Oser remembers walking 
back from a Sunday church service in Battell Chapel 
dressed in his best blue suit and blue suede shoes, mor­
tified that his clothes didn’t fit in. The very next day, he 
bought a tweed jacket from J. Press. 

Amidst a traditional, homogenous culture, Ross 
defied categorization. He was a legacy prep school kid 
on scholarship; a member of the Air Force ROTC and 
an English major; a frat boy who made the Dean’s List.

His fraternity, Chi Phi, attracted atypical members. 
Chi Phi was far less exclusive than Fence Club, Delta 
Kappa Epsilon, or any of the other houses where “you 
just had to be someone,” according to Oser. It had fewer 
prep school boys but more high-achieving students 
than other fraternities. But by the time Ross graduated, 
Chi Phi’s numbers were dwindling, and the fraternity 
permanently dissolved in 1961. 

Ross was part of the Yale literary scene, working on 
two starkly different publications. He was a member of 
the Yale Literary Magazine, which, at the time, the Yale 
Daily News described as dying, debt-ridden, and full of 
mediocre writers. Ross also contributed to Ivy Maga­
zine, a student-run, inter-school magazine that catered 
to the posh elite of the Ivy League.

At a time when post-college options seemed limited 
to banking, insurance, and brokerage, Ross yearned 
to be a writer. “People who were literarily inclined 
weren’t looked down on, they were just thought to 
be a little bit odd,” said Chauncey, though he did not 
know Ross personally. But Ross’s literary aspirations 
were short-lived. He dropped out of the legendary Yale
