RESISTANCE ON THE CORNER
For years, a few local women have stood by the road, calling for peace.

At 11:30 a.m. on the Sunday after President Donald 
Trump’s Inauguration, Susan Klein dons a floppy maroon 
hat with a pink “Women for Peace” button planted proudly 
on the front, straps on a red fanny pack stuffed with fli­
ers, and steps out the door. It’s a half-hour walk from her 
home near Westville to the triangular island at the corner 
of Broadway and Park Street in New Haven, across from 
Christ Church and Maison Mathis. By noon, she’s in 
position, holding up a silver Styrofoam sign emblazoned 
with two words in bold black letters: RESIST WAR.

Klein, who spent twenty years working in the Yale 
University library system before retiring in 2011, grew 
up in New Haven where her parents protested the Viet­
nam War on the Green. She has stationed herself on 
this corner most weekends for the better part of two 
decades in a ritual called the New Haven Sunday Vigil. 
“We’re US citizens,” she told me when we first met. 
“We have to speak out against terrible, criminal injus­
tice by our government.”

The protest tradition evolved out of a vigil against 
the Gulf War that met on the corner of Church and 
Chapel Streets every Thursday, starting in 1990. In 
1993, the group broadened its scope and renamed itself 
Peace and Justice News and Views. Shortly thereafter, 
it morphed again into the Connecticut Coalition for 
Peace and Justice, a larger group of activists from nearly 
a dozen local organizations. In 1999, when Klein first 
joined, the vigil moved to its current spot, and the ten


 18
members protested the NATO bombings of Kosovo. 
For the past six years, she has held vigil on the corner 
from noon to one almost every weekend.

Just after noon, Paula Panzarella and Monica 
McGovern arrive. Both have been protesting for over a 
decade. Panzarella has held several jobs over the years, 
including director of a soup kitchen, volunteer provid­
ing aid to the homeless, and garment factory worker. 
For her, activism has provided continuity. She grew up 
in New Haven and became engaged with local organiz­
ing in 1991, volunteering with the Progressive Action 
Roundtable, a forum for New Haven-area activist 
groups, for eight years before joining the vigil. McGov­
ern, the group’s most right-leaning member, joined the 
group in 2005 and volunteered with Ron Paul’s 2008 
presidential campaign.

Panzarella and McGovern take over the sign, stand­
ing solemnly under the gray sky, while Klein patrols in 
front, tightly gripping a stack of fliers. She’s soft-spo­
ken; sunglasses shield her kind eyes. Politely but per­
sistently, she plies passersby with pamphlets.

The women distribute eighty fliers each Sunday, typ­
ically produced and printed by Klein or a member of 
Jewish Voice for Peace. This week’s flier, entitled “The 
Biggest Meddler,” details seven egregious examples of 
political interference by the United States. The women 
oppose all military conflict, shifting their message as 
the government shifts its interventions.

The day before, hundreds of thousands of women 
had descended on Washington, DC for the Women’s 
March, chanting and singing as they filled the National 
Mall. The women of the New Haven Vigil occupy 
their triangle quietly, holding their banner and waving 
back when a car honks. They don’t sing or shout or 
beat a drum. The last Sunday of each month, members 
of the New Haven branch of Jewish Voice for Peace 
stand with them. Otherwise, it’s just Klein, Panzarella, 
McGovern, and Joan Cavanagh, who is on her way 
back from Washington today. 

“It’s very meaningful to stand here and bear witness 
and try to catch people’s attention quietly,” Klein says. 
McGovern doesn’t think their method reaches as many 
people as a larger protest might, but says, “there’s no 
room for me in big demonstrations because they’re 
dominated by left-wingers.”

Panzarella agrees with McGovern’s dislike of large 
protests, but disagrees with her rationale. “At a big­
ger demonstration, it’s hard to engage,” she says. “We 
give people the chance to ask the questions they have. 
Sometimes people approach us with animosity, but this 
allows us to exchange ideas.”

Some people race past, heads down. Some begrudg­
ingly take a flier and stuff it into a pocket. But others 
walk away reading the flier curiously, and a few strike 
up conversation.

The women have spread their message in varying 
styles over the decades. In 1973, to protest the govern­
ment’s bombings in Cambodia, Cavanagh climbed a 
water tower on a freeway outside Baltimore and landed 
in jail for ten days. At one protest on the Broadway tri­
angle, after sharing that story, she asks Klein the name 
of a tall building a couple blocks away. 
“That’s the Hall of Graduate Studies,” Klein replies. 
“Are you thinking of going up there, too?”
Cavanagh grins. “No, just looking.”

The others are less audacious in their methods. 
Panzarella speaks slowly and ponderously. McGovern 
uses short, clipped sentences. Klein often just listens, 
encouraging passersby to voice their concerns with 
occasional words of assent.

Today, a woman in a black parka walks up. “I’m 
Israeli and I’m absolutely terrified,” she says out of the 
blue. “Netanyahu and Trump are the same person.” 
Klein nods in agreement. They spend a few minutes 
decrying settlements on the West Bank.

After she leaves, Klein lets out a sigh of relief. “Some­
times you get these Orthodox Jews who say, ‘You don’t 
want Israel to exist,’” she explains. “I’m glad there was 
no argument. I’m not a confrontational person.”

Today’s vigil is the first since the inauguration of 
Donald Trump, but the women on Park and Broadway 
haven’t altered their message.

“The election didn’t change my sense of hope,” 
Cavanagh told me a week earlier. “It reinforced every­
thing we’ve been standing for the last twenty years, 
thirty years, forty years, fifty years.”

“I’m not sure if I’ve thought of things pre-election 
and post-election as being different,” Klein says today.

Peace advocacy is a never-ending endeavor. Since 
1999, the women have handed out around sixty thou­
sand fliers. But there are still soldiers in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Under Obama, extra-judicial drone kill­
ings became commonplace, and the United States sent 
troops to Syria, Libya, and Somalia. Even in left-lean­
ALL THEY TRY TO DO IS GET 
PEOPLE TO LOOK UP FROM 
THEIR PHONES, STOP FOR A 
SECOND, AND THINK.
