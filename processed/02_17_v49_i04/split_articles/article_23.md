held evidence of his innocence and thereby violated his 
constitutional rights. (According to the National Reg­
istry of Exonerations, 160 wrongfully convicted people 
were exonerated in both 2015 and 2016.) When Scott 
stepped off the bus into the February air, he was a free 
but not-yet-exonerated man with only the clothes on his 
back and the GPS device strapped to his ankle.

When someone is wrongfully imprisoned, all their 
resources go towards one thing: getting out. But reentry 
into society is not the same as reintegration. What hap­
pens after getting out? Besides arduous logistics (Do 
you have a bed to sleep in? How do you get an ID?), 
navigating the emotional saga of release is a colossal 
task. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has published a 
twenty-two-page handbook for released prisoners. It 
concludes with a “Rebuilding Your Relationships” sec­
tion, which advises prisoners to “begin by appreciating 
the small things,” and bear in mind that loved ones 
have aged in their absence. But what is that supposed 
to look like? Where on earth do you start? 

Scott’s first goal as a returning civilian was to avoid 
freezing to death on the sidewalk. He followed a line 
of people into the jail, saw a counselor he knew, and 
managed to borrow his phone. His call woke his sister 
Marlo, who rushed out of bed to pick him up. “Turn 
left,” her GPS said as they pulled out of the parking 
lot. Scott was floored. While he knew technology 
had changed since the nineteen-nineties, he hadn’t 
accounted for his sister’s talking car.

Even during those first hours—his reunion with 
Marlo, his mother, and then his children—Scott tried 
to figure out how he was going to move out of Marlo’s 
house. Without independence, he still felt imprisoned.
“Everyone was happy, everyone was celebrating, but 
I was isolated in my own mind, strategizing. What’s my 
next move? How am I going to get up in the morning? 
What am I going to wear?” he remembered.

Those first sixty days were excruciating. Even with 
a loving family and a place to stay, Scott felt trapped, 
reliant on others for food, cash, and transportation. He 
had one pair of shoes (work boots), and his only clothes 
smelled like the cobwebbed basement where they’d 
been stored during his twenty-year absence. He and 
his two twenty-something sons, Scottie Jr. and Tam­
aje, spent weeks driving around in the same little car, 
applying for the same jobs. Eventually, Scottie Jr. was 
hired, rendering Scott immobile once again.

“I really understood how people could come out of 
prison, have family support, and still break down and 
go back to what they were doing before,” Scott said. 
That’s exactly what happened to his son Tamaje, who 
had been released from prison a week before his father, 
and ended up back in jail for a few months in 2016. 

Twenty-four years earlier, on October 11, 1990, for­
mer New Haven alderman Ricardo Turner and his 
lover were murdered in bed following a cocaine-related 
heist. At the time, neighborhood dealers Scott Lewis 
and Stefon Morant owed ten thousand dollars to a local 
kingpin whose business depended on his partnership 
with a dirty cop, Detective Vincent Raucci. By 1995, 
Raucci had gathered several witness statements impli­
cating Scott and Stefon in the double murder, and the 
men were sentenced to 120 and seventy years, respec­
tively. An FBI investigation into the corrupt cop soon 
revealed that he’d blackmailed the witnesses into falsely 
placing them at the scene of the crime. The complete 
FBI file is dated January 24, 1997—less than two years 
after the men were incarcerated—but it would take 
eighteen years before both men were released for the 
crimes they didn’t commit.


Some of the events that occurred during that time: 
Scott and Stefon turned twenty-five, then thirty, then 
forty-five. Scott’s younger daughter Jesilinett learned to 
write her name in cursive, dropped out of high school, 
and became a certified medical assistant. Stefon’s twin 
sons, Christian and Julian, learned how to toss a base­
ball back and forth, then how to drive. Scott’s young­
est son, Tamaje, started kindergarten and eventually 
served a three-year drug possession sentence after being 
arrested and tried as an adult at the age of fifteen. Scott 
and Stefon became grandparents. Stefon’s father died, 
then his brother. His elementary school girlfriend wrote 
him a letter, and they got married. Scott taught himself 
to write appeals, which seven state judges rejected.

In 2009, then-Yale Law School professor Brett Dignam 
learned about the case through a judge with whom Scott 
had filed for writ of habeas corpus. Aided by a small 
team of her law students, she began working to secure 
his release. Finally, in 2014, a federal judge granted 
Scott habeas corpus, ruling that Connecticut had with­

Love
Stefon Morant, Scott’s co-defendant, was released 
from prison in August 2015, a year and a half after Scott, 
after serving for over two decades. Since his release, 
he’s bounced around from seasonal work to unemploy­
ment to a brief stint as a warehouse dockworker, which 
he had to quit because of his knees. When his job 
sweeping floors for the city came to a close in October, 
he felt nervous about being unemployed again.

Unlike Scott, who was officially exonerated in August, 
Stefon still has the murder felony on his record. (Rather 
than getting off on an early release, his sentence was cut 
to the shortest possible time, which he’d already served, 
minus a couple of years for good behavior. Also unlike 
Scott, Stefon had not aggressively represented himself 
or caught the attention of the Yale Law School clinic.) 
Still, he’s in good spirits. A large man who often smiles 
so big that his eyes disappear, Stefon says it’s tough to 
stay depressed for long, thanks largely to the Christian 
faith he discovered in prison. Remembering his home­
coming, he gazes at the ceiling.
“The first day was joy, of course,” he said. “It couldn’t 
have been any other feeling. It was an answered prayer 
from God.”

When the judge ruled that he’d get out, the court­
room was full of Morants—his mother, siblings, and 
cousins—who erupted in celebratory tears. His wife 
Kimberly said that, aside from the births of her three 
children, it was the happiest day of her life. At the 
moment of his release, she met him on the corner out­
side the New Haven Correctional Center, where Scott 
stood the previous winter, and asked where he wanted 
to go.

“All I wanted was to be able to put on a belt,” remem­
bers Stefon. “Think about it: twenty-one years, not 
being able to wear a belt with your pants.”

So straight to Marshalls they went, where they bought 
a belt, a pair of pants, and some slippers. Eighty min­
utes of freedom, and one goal already accomplished. 
His wife helped mitigate the struggles he faced com­
ing home. Kimberly had a house, a steady income, and 
a life with space carved out for him. It was easy to slip 
into. While Scott was worried about how long he’d 
have to live at his sister’s, Stefon moved right into his 
wife’s house.

When Kimberly and Stefon first dated, they were in 
elementary school. After breaking up as preteens, they 
remained friends. When Stefon went to prison, social 
circles they shared always maintained his innocence.

grew up, got married and had three children. After her

first husband’s death in 2007, she reached out to the 
still-incarcerated Stefon as a penpal. By 2008 they’d 
started a romance and by 2009 they were married. His 
faith in the face of a seemingly insurmountable sen­
tence attracted her. Devotion like that, she said, was 
what she sought in a partner. She always hoped but

never fully imagined they’d be able to live as a couple 
on the outside. Then, last July, they celebrated their 
marriage with both of their families and a traditional 
wedding party. Stefon was dressed in black and white. 
It was the happiest day of his life.   

A committed romantic relationship eventually blos­
somed in Scott’s new life, too. A few years into his 
incarceration, Scott’s mother told him offhandedly 
that a young woman had come into her hair salon. The 
woman knew Scott and believed that he was innocent, 
and the case had inspired her to go to law school to get 
him out. This was years before Dignam’s legal team 
had picked up Scott’s case. He needed all the help he 
could get, and he couldn’t believe his mother didn’t 
remember the woman’s name. Without knowing who 
she was, Scott thought of her often while slogging 
through legal work behind bars. He wondered whether 
she’d ever come back to the salon, whether his mother 
would ever remember her name, whether a young 
woman would ever appear with the key to his freedom.

About a month after he came home, Scott reached 
out to an old friend, Rachel Bidon, with whom “there’d 
always been an unspoken attraction” during his former 
marriage. She was with someone at the time, but they 
went for lunch anyway. Scott wore parachute pants and 
a sparkling gold shirt, the only “going-out” outfit he 
still had from the nineteen-nineties.

As they aired old feelings, she mentioned that she 
once wanted to be a lawyer, and in the midst of studying 
for the LSATs visited his mother’s salon to tell her that 
Scott had inspired her studies. Scott was dumbstruck. 
“When does that happen?” he said, shaking his head. “I 
looked at her and said, ‘You’re the one I’m looking for.’” 
They were married five months later. Their daughter, 
Harper-Rose, is now eleven months old.

Scott has been out for three years. He’s practicing 
real estate with Pike International, and he’s just a cou­
ple of steps away from obtaining his broker’s license. 
He loves talking about the clients that he has made 
homeowners. He wears a crisp white button-down and 
shiny black loafers to work. His wedding ring gleams 
on his left hand. He gestures like a politician while he 
talks, as if he is building something for you in the air.

“Who knows?” he says. “Maybe someday I’ll be 
mayor of New Haven.”
