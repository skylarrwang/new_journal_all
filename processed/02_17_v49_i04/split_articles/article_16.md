’85 is Trump’s pick for Secretary of the Treasury, but he 
ticks all the boxes that would qualify him as an enemy of 
Trump supporters. He is, quite literally, a Yale man, who 
looks—and has always looked—the part. 
Mnuchin started his career at Goldman Sachs, 
where his father was one of its top partners. Eventually, 
he moved to Hollywood, where he invested in films, 
launched OneWest Bank, and made a name for him­
self as a “foreclosure king.” CNN reported that OneW­
est became infamous for its “widow foreclosures,” the 
practice of booting elderly and vulnerable residents 
from their homes through onerous loans and techni­
calities, according to CNN.  In one instance, Mnuchin 
was said to have foreclosed on a home over an unpaid 
bill of twenty-seven cents.

Like other Trump cabinet nominees, Mnuchin has 
no government experience. His main qualification for 
Treasury Secretary seems to be that he’s dealt with 
money before. He is the chief executive of the hedge 
fund Dune Capital, which, the New York Times reports, 
was named for the dunes outside his vacation house in 
the Hamptons.  

According to his classmates in Hopper College (then 
called Calhoun College) and other members of the 
Yale Daily News board, Mnuchin hasn’t changed much 
since his Yale days.  When asked whether they were 
surprised that Mnuchin was one of Trump’s cabinet 
picks, many gave the same answer.
A pause. Then, “No.”

After graduating from New York City’s Riverdale 
Country Day School in 1981, Mnuchin followed 
his father to Yale, where classmates recall he drove a 
Porsche and lived off-campus in the luxe Taft Hotel 
on the corner of College and Chapel streets.  Kather­
ine Randolph ’85, a classmate in Hopper, recalls that 
he mostly hung out with other wealthy kids from New 
York private schools.  His two off-campus roommates, 
Eddie Lampert ’84 and Benjamin Bram ’84 both went 
into finance and worked with Mnuchin for some time 
at Goldman Sachs. (Reached by email in early January, 
Mnuchin said that he would do an interview with The 
New Journal after his confirmation. In the days after 
he was confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin did not 
return requests for comment, nor did he respond to an 
emailed list of questions.)

Mnuchin’s main extracurricular was the Yale Daily 
News. He didn’t write, but instead headed the business 
side—an almost entirely separate part of the newspa­
per, according to his colleagues on the editorial board. 
Bennett Voyles ’85, who described himself as a “fellow 
Newsie,” remembers the publishing team as “a sleek 
crew in Lacoste shirts who would glide in and out of 
the News building.”   

As publisher during his junior year, Mnuchin was 
embroiled in conflict with the News’ editorial board. 
After his nomination for Secretary of the Treasury, Dan 
Froomkin ’85, a former News editor tweeted: “I knew 
Steve Mnuchin back when his idea of fun was starv­
ing the Yale Daily News of resources to pad his resume 
as publisher.” Froomkin vividly recalls arguments 
between Mnuchin and the editorial staff, in which 
Mnuchin insisted on fewer pages of content to leave a 
financial surplus. Anndee Hochman ’84, the editor-in-
chief of the News in 1984, remembers a year of clashes 
as the editorial team pushed to maximize content and 
the publishing team tried to maximize profit. Voyles 
and Froomkin attempted a coup against Mnuchin, but 
Mnuchin and the News’ lawyer reportedly quashed it 
before it could get anywhere.

Mnuchin’s colleagues on the News largely found 
him difficult to work with—Hochman describes him 
as “self-confident to the point of arrogant, a smooth 
talker and a lousy listener”—and many of his peers 
in Hopper remember him as equally unpleasant. 
One of his female classmates, who wanted to remain 
anonymous because she is afraid of being “sent to the 
Trump gulag,” said she “always felt like taking a cold 
shower when in his environs.” Mark Danziger ’85 is 
quoted in Businessweek as saying he “put the douche 
in fiduciary.”

But not everybody felt negatively about Mnuchin. 
Hopper classmate Serena Williams ’85 says she remem­
bers Mnuchin as “always nice and smiling.” And he was 
tapped for Yale’s most illustrious secret society, Skull 
and Bones. Mnuchin entered the society in his senior 
year, along with his roommate Eddie Lampert, whose 
hedge fund he later worked for, and James Boasberg, 
the federal judge who ruled this September that con­
struction could proceed on the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Mnuchin’s Senate confirmation was rocky; he failed 
to disclose one hundred million dollars in assets on 
the Senate Finance Committee documents, claim­
ing that he had “misunderstood” the questionnaire. 
But by February 13—the Monday after he attended 
Steve Schwarzman’s seventieth birthday party in Palm 
Beach, where he and fellow guests Wilbur Ross, Ivanka 
Trump, and Jared Kushner enjoyed acrobatic perfor­
mances, two camels, and a rendition of “Happy Birth­
day” by Gwen Stefani, according to Bloomberg—the 
Senate voted 53-47 to confirm him. In December, he’d 
already updated his job title on the alumni database to 
“Secretary of the Treasury of the U.S.,” making things 
already Yale-official.
