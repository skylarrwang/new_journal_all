tieth centuries sometimes faced discrimination and 
prejudice; today their descendants include New Hav­
en’s longest-serving mayor and current United States 
Representative Rosa DeLauro. As long as the Annex 
Club has been open, the community it serves has been 
transforming. But its regulars, who built railroads and 
coached Little League, still come to the Club.


The Club’s numbers, as well as its influence, have 
dwindled. “We donated an awful lot of our time and 
our expenses to the city of New Haven,” Balchek tells 
me. “Lots of charity work, fundraisers, offered the place 
up if people needed a place to host things, say. It’s very 
difficult for us to do that today. In today’s society, it’s 
not cheap to open up the doors.” Beyond the economic 
burden, the tight-knit community of families has also 
changed. “I miss the old days,” Tirotello says. “We used 
to have Saturday night dinners here. We don’t do that 
anymore. Because nobody wants to come!” 


To survive, the Annex Club has evolved. Instead of 
hosting wedding parties for its members, the Club hosts 
motorcycle shows and the Connecticut Gay Men’s 
Choir. They still offer scholarships for Club members’ 
children, and they still host community events, but 
Bingo Night, bookings, and Astorino’s careful work as 
treasurer keep the Club afloat. 


On a typical Thursday, any melancholy nostalgia is 
drowned out by the cheerful chaos of the Bingo crowd. 
Astorino teases Tirotello, once again, about his age. 
Balchek says happy birthday to a woman who has just 
won fourteen dollars. Conversations about children 
and spouses float throughout the hall. People still come 
every Thursday for Bingo, and many come more often, 
for meals or drinks in the lounge. Astorino tells me that 
they are booked “pretty much every Saturday for the 
next two years.”

Behind the concession stand counter, Robert 
“Bobby” Astorino—the current treasurer and former 
president of the Annex Club—sells Bingo cards. He 
stands in front of flowers and a “Family, Laugh, Love” 
sign and informs me, politely but firmly, that he does 
not have time to talk. He directs me to a smaller table 
where a man sells lottery numbers, collecting the 
money in small tin brownie pans. Joe Tirotello, who is 
88, has worked Bingo Night for thirty-five years. He has 
also served as a coach for the Annex Club-sponsored 
Little League team and volunteers on Tuesday after­
noons when retirement home residents visit the club. 
Tonight, he knows almost everyone by name.

The Annex neighborhood—the club’s namesake—
welcomed a constant stream of Italian immigrants 
beginning in the 1890s. The New Haven immigrants 
created “mutual aid societies” such as La Fratellanza 
(“The Brotherhood”) and La Marineria (“The Navy”), to 
support Italians as they built new lives in United States. 
At the end of the Great Depression, twenty-eight 
Italian-American men began a Young Men’s Associa­
tion known as the Annex Club. Its goals were slightly 
different from those of the original Italian-American 
societies. A pamphlet from the club’s fiftieth anniver­
sary states the original objectives, one of which was: 
“to engage in community activities which will advance 
the interests of this organization and its membership 
in the community.” Put more simply, the men of the 
neighborhood wanted a place where, after working or 
playing a game of football, they could convene, relax, 
and remind themselves of what Tirotello, a life-long 
Club member and the son of an original member, still 
refers to as the “Old Country.” 


The club is no longer exclusively Italian-American 
nor exclusively male, though a large portion of its par­
ticipants are either original members or descendants 
of them. Al Balchek, another Bingo Night volunteer 
and former president of the club, proudly tells me, “We 
have Irish, we have Polish, we have Jewish, African 
American, Puerto Rican.” 


Balchek himself is Polish-Italian, and as we walk 
around the club, Italian names still dominate: Astorino, 
Castiglione, Apuzzo, Berrelli, Ginetti. They line the 
wall in the members-only lounge, feature heavily on 
the donors list, and belong to many of the Bingo play­
ers. Though their heritage is a source of pride for these 
people, most don’t dwell on it. The Club was a place 
for dances and Fourth of July fireworks, as well as for 
recollections of Italy. In building supportive communi­
ties to help their members succeed, the mutual aid soci­
eties and the Annex Club also promoted assimilation.
