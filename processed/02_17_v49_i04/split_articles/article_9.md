EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a late October morning in 2016, a bird landed in 
the model airplane field at Sherwood Island State Park 
near Westport. At that time of year, this particular bird 
expected warm weather and the banks of the Mississippi. 
Here, it stood less than half a mile away from the cold 
Atlantic Ocean. It hid in the grassiest patch of the park 
among dried, golden reeds, far away from any of its kin. It 
had never been more lost. 

The same morning, sixteen-year-old Preston Lust sat 
at one of the park’s picnic tables with his family, having 
lunch on his stepdad’s birthday. He lives ten minutes 
away from Sherwood Island. 

Preston is one of Connecticut’s most skilled young 
bird watchers. He started birding with his grandfather 
at age nine, and he’s seen and recorded over five hun­
dred species since, a number many adult birders hope 
to reach. He’s also too young to have a driver’s license, 
which means that he is an expert on his hometown’s 
natural habitat. Nearly half of his sightings have been 
in Connecticut. On eBird, the most popular website for 
birders to record their sightings, Preston submits check­
lists from his backyard almost every day detailing which 
birds he saw and how many. He’s a master of Sherwood 
Island, too—quietly, as if he were retrieving something 
familiar from a shelf, he knows in which trees he can 
find a saw-whet owl and which bushes are good for spot­
ting warblers. Some competitive birders “chase” the 
species they want to see, buying plane tickets to Arizona 
and Alaska. Preston prefers his neighborhood.  

Before the picnic at Sherwood that morning, he had 
already seen a rare red crossbill near his house. At the 
park, he and his brother Terry wandered over to the 
model airplane field after lunch to see if they could 
spot anything else. Here, the locals met the visitor. 

After following a group of eastern meadowlarks into 
the reeds, Preston saw the bird. It crouched near a tall 
wall of grass, small and beige and shaped like an easy-
to-miss songbird. The brothers first thought it could be 
an everyday American pipit. But, as they kept watching 
it, the bird didn’t bob its head as much as it should, and 
the umber feathers on its back glowed white around 
the edges. 

Preston started taking field notes, and he recorded a 
blurry cellphone video. Then, he sent a message to the 
local birders’ email listserv.
“I alerted them to the fact that we potentially had a 
Sprague’s pipit,” he told me. This bird, blown wildly off 
its migratory course by wind and confusion, had never 
been seen in Connecticut. 
“So, uh, this was a big deal.” 

—
“Best bird I saw all year.”
“Best bird I’ve seen in Connecticut.” 

At the January meeting of the Connecticut Young 
Birders Club (CYBC), club president Brendan Murtha 
and member Jory Teltser talked about the day Preston 
saw the Sprague’s pipit as they birded near the shore in 
Greenwich. Both boys rushed over to the park as soon 
as they heard, and Jory, one of Preston’s best friends 
at school, took photos and posted them online. “First 
state record found by my friend, and young birder, 
Preston Lust (only 15 years old)!” the caption read. 

The first people to see the bird were all under the age 
of eighteen. 

“A lot of the big-name Connecticut birders who 
keep really serious state lists dropped everything and 
got there as fast as they could,” Brendan said. The 
next morning, about thirty people showed up to get a 
glimpse, but the pipit had already left. 

Connecticut is one of the states with the most bird 
watchers per capita according to the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, though most of them are adults. The CYBC, 
which welcomed its tenth member during the January 
meeting, tries to be as involved as it can in the larger 
birding scene. But compared to, say, New York’s sev­
enty-member equivalent (whose president was recently 
profiled in the New York Times), it’s small. Plus, Con­
necticut itself isn’t exactly a birder’s paradise.
“It’s boring,” Jory told me, and Brendan agreed. It’s 
a small, developed state with no open ocean, and there 
aren’t many trees far away from a road. Jory remedies 
the problem by keeping as busy as he can—perhaps 
practicing for somewhere more exciting. He is men­
tored by the former president of the Connecticut 
Ornithological Association, and he once saw three 
hundred species in the state over the course of a year, 
putting him in the ultra-exclusive “300 Club.” Bren­
dan, who will graduate from high school this spring, 
said he “has to get out of Connecticut.” 

Preston Lust feels a little differently. He wants to live 
in Connecticut for the rest of his life, as does his brother. 
When I asked Jory about what kind of birder Preston 
is, he said that, despite staying outside the circle of 
competitive Connecticut birders and not being much 
of a “chaser,” he has a knack for encountering the birds 
that more goal-hungry watchers might overlook.


Recently, Preston put a high-powered microphone 
on the roof of his house that connects to his computer. 
Overnight, as birds fly over his house, the microphone 
records their nocturnal flight calls, which he listens to 
the next morning with sonogram software. This helps 
him recognize birds he can’t see. 
“You’ll be birding with him, and he’ll say that he 
heard something fly over,” Jory said. “And it’s like, not 
only did I not hear that, how did you identify that?” 

Preston, Jory, Brendan, and another CYBC club 
member are planning on entering a birding competi­
tion in New Jersey called the World Series, under the 
name “CYBC Darth Waders.” The last time Brendan 
competed, his car got stuck in a sinkhole, but he’s more 
confident about his chances this year. Preston, he said, 
is their “secret weapon.”

Preston and Terry walk along the paths on Sherwood 
Island a month after the Sprague’s pipit sighting. The 
brothers are silent as they bird, both dressed in black 
sweaters and black pants, hugging their binoculars to 
their chests. Every once in a while, they softly call out 
each other’s names, point at a branch, and stare. 
When they get to the shore around dusk, Preston 
points at a gull standing near the water. Unlike the 
other birds on the beach, its back looks like smooth, 
grey slate. The lesser black-backed gull, as he calls it, 
is the only one of its kind on Sherwood Island. It has 
been coming back to this beach every year since he 
started birding. 

Preston walks off the path and towards the sand. 
“Do you see something?” Terry asks. 
“No. I just felt like going on the beach.”
