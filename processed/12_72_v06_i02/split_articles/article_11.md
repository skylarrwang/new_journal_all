A COMPONENT SYSTEM AT A PORTABLE 
PRICE: OUR $199 SYSTEM, USUALLY $280. 
SANSUI 210 AM/ FM STEREO RECEIVER 
BSR 310X AUTOMATIC TURNTABLE 
CREATIVE MODEL 22 LOUDSPEAKERS 
It used to be that for under two hundred dollars 
you could only get a portable. But now Fred Locke 
has changed all that by putting together a system 
whose components have been carefully selected to 
complement each other, so that you get the 
highest possible fidelity at the lowest possible 
price. The heart of the system is the Sansui 210 
AM/FM receiver. It incorporates many features 
usually only found in the more expensive re· 
ceivers: FET frontend, headphone jack and a 
tuning meter. It has just the right amount of 
power to drive the Creative Model 222 loudspeakers. 
They are efficient two·way acoustic suspension 
speaker systems. The BSR McDonald 310X 
automatic turntable has a low-mass tonearm, vari-
able anti-skating, and a·cueing lever, to treat your 
records with care. The system also includes a base, 
dustcover, and a Shure M75C cartridge. The entire 
system, if bought separately, would cost you 
about $280. We are offering it to you for $199. 
Before the system goes out to you, we check out 
the turntable and receiver and explain all of the 
functions to you ·· so that you may enjoy it 
immediately in your own home.
