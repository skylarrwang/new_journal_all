The Groundlings 
by David Milch 
David Milch 's The Groundlings follows a 
family for the three days between the 
death of its youngest member in an auto-
mobile and his funeral. Almon Little III, 
"Judgy, "named and nicknamed for his 
grandfather, is survived by his parents, 
James and Mary Emily, and two broth-
ers, Phillip and Mark. Six weeks prior to 
the death the father was expelled fro.m 
the home. 


Mark is a student at Cornell Univer-
sity, as was his younger brother. In this 
chapter he is en route to Toronto, Cana-
da, to pick up his older brother, whose 
air flight from Los Angeles to Buffalo 
has been re-routed because of a snow-
storm. Mark has been awake for twenty-
four hours. 


The trip from Ithaca to Buffalo normal-
ly takes less than two hours, but the snow 
made visibility poor, and the road slip-
pery, and Mark was able to drive at no 
more than half the usual rate of speed. 
The trip was further prolonged by his 
having to make two stops for coffee, for 
though he drove with the heater turned 
off, and the window on his side of the car 
rolled half way down, he experienced con-
siderable difficulty in staying awake. 


Once, a few miles outside of Buffalo, he 
did in fact doze off, and barely awakened 
in time to bring the car under controL He 
stopped for the next hitch-hiker he saw. 


The hitch-hiker trotted toward Mark's 
car, his chin tucked in to the collar of the 
long blue overcoat which he wore against 
the cold. Apparently he had been trying 
to get a ride for some time, as his cheeks 
and ears were quite red, and he was shiv-
ering noticeably. Mark leaned across the 
front seat, opening the door for him, and 
got in, smiling. "Bless you.'' 


"Where are you going?" Mark asked. 
"Are you going north?" 
"I'm going . . . Yes, north is fine." 
"Toronto? I can give you a ride any-
where up to there." 
"Toronto is fine. Yes." 


Mark put the car into gear, checked 
the rear-view mirror, then slowly pulled 
back onto the road. "How long were you 
out there?" 
" I believe about an hour or so. I lost 
track .. .I believe about an hour." The 
hitch-hiker unbuttoned his overcoat, and 
took a deep breath. "Really, thank you. It 
was awfully cold." 
"No, I was about to fall asleep. I need-
ed someone to keep me up." 
"Well, that's all right. That doesn't. .. 
It was still very kind." The hitch-hiker 
looked over at Mark. "Are you ... Where 
are you coming from? Have you been on 
the road long?" 
"I left Ithaca around three hours ago. 
Not that long. But I've been up a while. 
I needed someone to keep me up." 


The hitch-hiker watched the sign for 
the Peace Bridge Exit pass by his window. 
He was silent for a moment, then cleared 
his throat. "Say, did you want to get off 
at the Peace Bridge? Is that the way to 
Canada?" 
"What, did we pass it?" 
"Just a little while ago. I just saw the 
sign." 


Mark exhaled heavily, stopped the car, 
and after waiting for a lull in traffic, 
crosSed the median. scraping the bottom 
of the car on the conC{ete curb. He mut-
tered an obscenity. then slid down in the 
seat, draping his right arm over its back. 
"Thanks." 
"Well for a minute I thought you 
might be taking a short-cut. But then I 
thought I'd tell you, in case you missed 
the sign." 


Mark glanced at him. "Thanks." 
"Well, with the snow, I knew it was 
hard to see." 


They reached the toll-barriers on the 
American side of the bridge. Mark handed 
the toll-officer a quarter, and asked about 
the driving conditions from .the border to 
Toronto. The toll-officer replied that he'd 
suggest they take the King's Highway, it 
ought to have been ploughed and should 
be clear all the way. Mark thanked him, 
and they proceeded to the Customs Area 
on the Canadian side, where they were 
asked their places of birth, Mark' replying 
Buffalo, and the hitch-hiker Grand Rap-
ids, and were then issued a temporary 
travel· permit. 


Mark handed the permit to the hitch-
hiker as they drove away from the Cus-
toms Area. He took the turn marked 
"King H", drove a half-circle, and picked 
up the highway. It had not been plough-
ed, and traffic was moving slowly. "Well 
this is just terrific. This is just frigging 
ballsy. We ought to make it in about 
twelve hours." 


The hitch-hiker couldn't get the glove 
compartment open. "Say, I think this is 
stuck. I can't. . .I think it must be 
stuck." He held the permit out to Mark. 
"Do you ... " 
"Well put it in the visor or something. 
I don't care what you do with it. Put it 
in the visor." Mark sank back down in the 
seat. "Look at this. This is the road that 
was going to be ploughed." 


They drove a while in silence, the 
hitch-hiker periodically checking the se-
curity of the permit in the visor, and oth-
er-wise occupying himself with staring at 
the passing farmlands. Mark had raised his 
window, and now again draped his right 
arm over the back of the seat. After a few 
moments his eyes began to close, his grip 
relaxed on the wheel, and the car drifted 
into the passing lane. A Greyhound which 
was perhaps fifty yards behind them and 
rapidly approaching sounded its horn and 
blinked its headlights. Mark sat up quick-
ly and steered the car back to the right. 
He massaged the lower portion of his face 
with his right hand, and looked over at the 
hitch-hiker, who had not shifted his gaze 
from the bleak scenery. "Hey, you know 
you're supposed to be keeping me awake. 
I didn't pick you up for your looks." 


The hitch-hiker turned quickly. "What 
... Oh, I'm sorry." 
"We nearly got labelled, while you 
were away." 
" I was .. .I'm sorry." 


Mark did not speak for a moment. 
Then, half-turning to the hitch-hiker, but 
with his eyes still on the road, said, "Well 
look, why don't you ... You're a pretty 
reliable type aren't you? Did you ever do 
time?" 
"No ... I ... " 
"I mean if I were to let you drive my 
short, you wouldn't whack me over the 
head or anything. While I sleep? I've got 
to get some sleep." 


The hitch-hiker flushed. "I'm ... The 
trouble is, I'm afraid I can't drive yet." 


Mark glance over at the hitch-hiker. 
then ·looked back to the road. "How old 
are you? You look ... C'mon. You've got 
to be older than eighteen. Sixteen. for 
Christ's sake. It's still daylight." 


The hitch-hiker shifted on the seat. 
"No, I'm twenty-three. I'm old enough. 
The thing is, I don't know how yet. I 
never learned." 


Mark nodded. "That's just ... How 
can you get to be twenty-three and not 
know how to drive a car?" 
"I'm sorry. I just ... I don't know." 


The hitch-hiker took the permit from the 
visor. "I never got around to it. I never 
learned." 


"Boy, the shit is getting to hit the fan. 
You can't ... "Mark looked over at the 
hitch-hiker. "Here, well don't poop out 
on me for Christ's ~ake. You saw what ... 
Sing songs or something. Make a little 
small talk." 
"Well, uh, what would you like ... Shall 
we ... shall I introduce myself?" 
"Great. Right." 
"Well, my name is Paul Yerman." He 
smiled and offered his hand. "How do 
you do?" 
"Fine Paul." Mark nodded to him. 
"Real well, thanks." 


Paul hesitated for a moment before 
lowering his hand. "Well, and, uh, I'm 
from Grand Rapids, in Michigan." 
"Is that right?" 
"Yes, and ... Say, uh, did you tell me 
your name? I'm sorry." 
"Mark. From Buffalo, in New York." 
"Oh . Pleased ... " Paul began to raise 
his hand, then lowered it to the seat a-
gain, picking up the permit. "And ... 
Well, I go to school. To the Divinity 
School, at Yale." 
"You do, eh? You meet a better class 
of people on the road these days." Mark 
glanced quickly at Paul, then colored 
slightly. "What, and you're going home 
now? For vacation or SOJl'!ething?" 


Paul folded the permit in half. "No, 
my father ... passed away. Last evening. 
I'm going home now, for the funeral." 
"Oh, I'm sorry." Mark looked over at 
Paul. "I'm sorry. That's too bad." 
"Well, it was quite sudden. My mother 
said it was quite sudden ... and painless. 
We have that to be thankful for." Paul 
turned and stared out the window. 


"Actually, I'm ... "Mark's face had 
gone red. "Well, I'm sorry. I'm ... God, 
they don't put anyorie in the chorus any· 
more." 


Paul did not reply, and Mark kept his 
eyes on the road during the silence which 
followed. After a few moments he opened 
his window, glancing at Paul. "Look do 
you mind if ... Is this going to bother 
you? I mean as long as you're not going 
to talk ... " Mark rubbed his face, and 
took a long, slow breath. "What I mean is, 
it's all right, you know, if you don't want 
to talk. I understand. But rm going to 
fall asleep, I promise you, if I don't open 
the window. I can't keep my eyes open." 


Paul turned back to Mark. "No ... 
I'm really, I'm flne. No, but open the 
window. But I'm flne. I'd like ... I'm 
happy to talk to you." He smiled weakly. 
"Really." 


Mark smiled too. "We may wind up 
with ruptured tongues." 
"Excuse me?'' Paul rubbed his thumb 
along the edge of the folded permit. "I'm 
afraid I didn't ... I must not have been 
paying ... " 


Mark laughed. "Nothing, Rebop. What 
are you taking in school?" 
"I still don't ... Is that what you were 
saying? I'm afraid ... " 
"No, what I wanted to know was what 
are you majoring in? In Divinity School. 
Do they have that?"
