not," Skeeter says. "It's all a matter of 
desire and whether or not the breaks 
come your way." 

Since the Nighthawk season opened, 
Skeeter has lived in a beach house in East 
Haven with teammate Neil Nicholson. "I 
fmd I can live pretty comfortably on my 
hockey salary," Skeeter observes. "Ten, 
fifteen thousand a year-that's decent 
money." 

Skeeter Teal likes to keep up with the 
latest mod fashions. His long blonde hair 
is cut in a shag style. When he wears his 
hockey uniform, his hair grazes the 
shoulders of his jersey. 

Most of the Nighthawk players enjoy 
dressing well. Neil Nicholson has played-
as a professional for four years and has 
observed a difference in men's fashions 
among the various hockey cities. "I used 
to get my clothes in Montreal when I was 
playing for the Providence Reds," Nichol-
son recalls. "At first they used to laugh at 
me down in Providence. Then, three 
months later the same thing would come 
out in the stores down there." 

After hockey games, many Nighthawk 
players flock to some of New Haven'~ 
better bars. In past years, Blades players 
could often be seen at the dingy Arena 
Bar and Grille, sipping on beers and mak-
ing time with middle-aged women. But · 
most of the Nighthawks frequent the 
Zodiac or Pat's or the Coliseum Lounge 
on Crown St. Here , at "New Haven 's 
Newest Live Spot," some of the young 
Nighthawks attract a new breed of hockey 
"groupies" - girls in tight sweaters and 
mini-skirts, secretaries or students who 
are always ardent Nighthawk fans. 

But not all the Nighthawks are young 
men who enjoy clothing, bars, and New 
Haven girls. Thirty-seven-year-old WiUie 
0-ree, the only black man ever to play in 
the National Hockey League, recently 
came to the Nighthawks from the San 
Diego Gulls. He is starting to go bald 
slightly and his face shows traces of his 
17 years in professional hockey. "It's no 
rougher for me today than it was ten 
years ago." 0-ree claims. " I just get tired 
a little easier." 

0-ree thinks this may be his last sea-
son. "I like the game, but I've been stay-
ing in mostly for the money," the oldest 
player on the Nighthawks explains. " I've 
got a couple of business opportunities in 
San Diego and Vancouver that I have to 
check out." 

Another veteran now with the Night· 
hawks is Terry Gray. A former forward 
with Montreal and St. Louis of the Nat-
ional League, Gray left his farm near Mon-
treal this year to return to minor 
league hockey. He retired as a player two 
years ago to become the coach of Colum-
bus in the International League. 

"But I didn't care for the organization 
I was in," Gray recalls. "So I phoned Bill 
Torrey [General Manager of the New 
York Islanders) , and he sent me to New 
Haven." 

Gray has moved his wife and two 
children to Hamden, and expects to fmish 
his playing career with the Nighthawks. 
He also hopes to coach again, preferably 
in the Montreal area. 

"In this business you never can tell 
where you1J be," Terry Gray says. "But 
I like hockey. It's my life." 

Most of the younger Nighthawks view 
hockey as only a temporary part of their 
lives. Ken McPhail, who graduated last 
year from Michigan Tech with a degree in 
business administration, fmds profession-
al hockey "an interesting experience." 

"It's a rather dull pace of life," he 
says. "I've got a good two year contract 
and I'll just see how it goes. I want to get 
out of hockey while I still have my teeth 
and while my knees are still good." 

Though they receive salaries of more 
than $10,000, not all the young Night-
hawks plan on a hockey career. At a re-
cent practice session, 24-year-old goalie 
Glenn Resch expressed some of his own 
misgivings. 

"The life of a hockey player is really 
a pretty shallow one," Resch explained. 
As he spoke, only his eyes and mouth 
could be seen through the holes of his red 
goalie mask. "You waste a lot of time 
doing nothing. It's really a pretty shel-
tered existence." Resch leaned back 
against the sideboards. Streams of sweat 
ran down his neck and darkened his white 
practice jersey. " Let's say you've got a 
team meal at 1 o'clock, and then there's 
a couple of hours to kill before the game. 
I guess you could go to the library for a 
couple of hours. But you don't. You just 
watch TV or rest for awhile. 

Resch is especially interested in the 
career of Ken Dryden, the former Cor-
nell goalie who now stars for the Mon-
treal Canadiens. "I'd like to see whether 
Ken stays around for more than a few 
years," Resch says. "He's a bright guy- . 
not going to let himself get stale." 

Resch graduated from the University 
of Minnesota two years ago and played 
professional hockey last season in Mus-
kegon, Ohio. He hopes to teach and coach 
high school hockey after he stops playing. 

Few of the Nighthawks seem willing to 
let themselves get stale. Neil Nicholson 
would like to audit courses at Yale. Barry 
Boughner took a class at Drake when he 
played at Des Moines last year. Pat Thorn-
ton needs one more credit to earn a 
degree from Boston University. 

This is a new breed of minor league 
hockey players. They enjoy higher sal-
aries and new pension plans, yet they 
look to the future. 

Skeeter Teal owns a hockey school in 
St. Catherines and has several other in-
vestments. When his hockey career ends, 
he hopes to start a resort in Northern On-
tario. 

"Ufe isn't that long, so you gotta keep 
making plans," Skeeter Teal says. "You 
never know when you'll have to stop 
playing hockey." •
