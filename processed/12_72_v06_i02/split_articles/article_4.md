**The New Haven Nighthawks: "an interesting experience."**
**Author: Roger Cohn**
**Page number(s): 6-7**

Four thousand hockey fans inside the 
New Haven Coliseum await the start of 
the game. Some chat quietly. Others 
read the latest edition of "Hockey 
News." At one corner of the rink, 
"Dave Perry and the Rock in' Chair 
Band" pound out a brassy rock tune 
Chicago style. 

Suddenly the music changes to some-
thing off the soundtrack of Shaft. A door 
swings open along the sideboards. The 
Nighthawks skate out in their bright blue 
and white uniforms. The players look 
young. Long hair hangs over their ears or 
juts out beneath their helmets. 

"Ladies and Gentlemen," booms the 
public address announcer. "Here are the 
New Haven Nighthawks ... Come on, 
Nighthawks. Let's Fly!" 

Who are the Nighthawks? You may 
have seen some Nighthawk bumper stick-
ers and woolen beanies around town this 
fall. These have nothing to do with the 
ecology movement. They refer to the 
American Hockey League team that just 
began its first season in the multi-million 
dollar Veteran Memorial Coliseum. 

New Haven hockey fans have support-
ed a professional club for more than 
forty-five years. The Eagles of the old 
Canadian-American League brought 
hockey here in 1926. A decade later they 
became one of the pioneer teams of the 
American League, and the Eagles stayed 
for almost twenty years. 

When Mayor Bart Guida decided to 
build a new arena, he hoped he could at-
tract big-time professional sports to New 
Haven. But neither the major basketball 
leagues nor hockey leagues wanted to 
place a franchise in a small city so near 
the big sports markets of New York and 
Boston. Finally the American Hockey 
League agreed to grant a minor league 
team to a group of New Haven business-
men, and the Nighthawks were born. 

Most New Havenites associate minor 
league hockey with the rugged New 
Haven Blades of the Eastern League who 
used to play at the dreary, decaying New 
Haven Arena. The old Blades with their 
brawling style of hockey enjoyed great 
popularity. Blades' fans sat on hard, 
wooden Arena benches amid peanut 
shells and crushed beer cups. They 
expected a brawl during the course of a 
game, either on the ice or in the stands, 
and they usually got one. But this year 
the Blades have been forced to move to 
Hartford to make way for the Night-
hawks. 

The fans at the new Coliseum differ 
from the old crowds that used to pack 
the Arena. In the red, white, and blue 
cushioned seats, you now see businessmen 
in three-piece suits and many women and 
children. 

Allan Giarelli, a men's hair stylist from 
East Haven, has season tickets to Night-
hawk games for his twelve-year-old son 
and himself. "We like hockey and we like 
the Coliseum," Giarelli said as he arrived 
for a recent game against the Tidewater 
Wings. He wore a flower-design shirt and 
tan, two-tone shoes. "We haven't missed 
a home game yet. I just wish they'd start 
winning some.'' 

The Nighthawks have been losing, but 
they have developed a core of dedicated 
fans. "The crowds have been surprisingly 
good considering the way we've been 
playing," points out Parker MacDonald, 
general manager and coach of the Night-

To free them from the stereotype asso-
ciated with minor league hockey, the 
management has presented its team as the 
"new" Nighthawks. The rock music and 
the colorful team beanies form only part 
of their public relations effort. At a 
recent game against the Hershey Bears, 
every fan entering the Coliseum received 
a complimentary Hershey bar from one 
of the girl ushers. The girls wear red wool-
en jackets, short blue skirts, and high 
white vinyl boots. They look like some-
thing out of the Houston Astrodome. 

But it is the players themselves who 
most clearly reflect the new trend in 
minor league hockey. Since the Night-
hawks are a farm club for the National 
League's New York Islanders, they are 
required to have at least eight players 
under 23 and only 2 players over 26. 

Like most new teams, the Nighthawks 
have had trouble with the established 
clubs in the League, winning only two of 
their first twelve games. "We knew it was 
going to be difficult right off the bat," 
admits Coach MacDonald. "It'll take time 
and patience to get this club moving." 

Nineteen-year-old Gary Howatt came 
to the Nighthawks straight from a junior 
hockey club in Flin Flom, Manitoba. 
"This is my first time in the States," 
Howatt said as he laced a pair of wrinkled 
brown skates before a recent practice. 
"The guys are a lot stronger in this 
league. They skate faster and play better 
than they do in the juniors." 

The Nighthawks roster lists Gary How-
att as 5'9" and 170 pounds, but he does-
n't look that big. If you entered the Night-
hawks locker room and saw his beardless 
face and his shy, boyish manner, you 
would never pick him out as one of the 
leading scorers and roughest players on 
the team. 

"Howatt's the gutsiest kid I've ever 
seen," Parker MacDonald claims. "He'll 
hit anybody." 

But when Gary Howatt talks about 
himself he says, "Sure my toughness 
helps me, but if I don't work on the basic 
skills of the game, then I won't make it to 
the National League." 

As a young and relatively small club, 
the Nighthawks must rely on speed and 
agility. Skeeter Teal, a fo
