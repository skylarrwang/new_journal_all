Russians and Slavophiles greet each other, radiant, speaking quickly. It is a very special night for them. Joseph Brodsky, emigre poet, walks to the stage at the Law School Auditorium. He sits, smoking, looking into the audience; strong, fresh, his hands hiding in the front pockets of his corduroy jacket. Whim-lead Americans and students fumbling through translations may miss the subtleties of the verse. But ultimately they will share in the poet. He will expel the words from his mouth, pounding the rhythm, forging with the sway of his body the universal themes. And tonight he will lay claim to an audience and a literary tradition far beyond the land severed from him.


The poet commands form but remains anti-formalist, fighting shallow gamesmanship of stanzaic and metrical virtuosity. The order, rather than constraining, serves to create freedom, and to promote the personal vision that grounds the boldest abstraction. There is a sweeping quality to the lines---staccato rhythm yet enjambment, traditional meter yet fresh syntax. Brodsky stands the embodiment of the Russian tradition, but one who has stepped beyond his contemporaries: Who has influenced you? "Baratynslcy, Tyutchev, Tsvetayeva, and of course Derzhavin." (an eighteenth century fore bearer none of his contemporaries would even include on the list)


Brodsky's themes--man, his culture, mortality--are timeless and nationless. Long before this night, while still in his homeland, Brodsky embraced the English language and poetic tradition. He has said that here lies the greatest achievement in the world of poetry, and has long been under its influence. Appropriately, Brodsky chose to recite first, Verses on the Death of T. S. Eliot.


**Title: Verses on the Death of T. S. Eliot**

I
He died at the start of the year, in January.
His front door flinched in frost by the streetlamp.
There was no time for nature to display
the splendors of her choreography.
Where are you, Magi, who read men's souls?
Come now and hold his halo high for him.
Two mournful figures gaze upon the ground.
They sing. How very similar their songs!
Apollo, fling your garland down,
Let it be the poet's crown,
sign of immortality,
all there is where mortals be.
Black windowpanes shrank mutely in the snow.
The cold's town-crier stood beneath the light.
At crossings puddles stiffened into ice.
He latched his door on the thin chain of years.
The days he leaves to us will not declare
a bankruptcy of Muses. Poetry
is orphaned, yet it breeds within the glass
of lonely days, each echoing each, that swim
to distance. It will splash against the eye,
sink into lymph, like some Aeolian nymph,
a narcissistic friend. But in the rhyme
of years the voice of poetry stands plain.
With neither grimace nor maliciousness
death chooses from its bulging catalogue
the poet, not his words, however strong,
but just- unfailingly - the poet's self.
It has no use for thickets or for fields
or seas in their high, bright magnificence.
Death is a prodigal, it piles
a horde of hearts upon a wisp of time.
Used Christmas trees had flared in vacant lots,
and broken baubles had been broomed away.
Winged angels nestled warmly on their shelves.
A Catholic, he lived till Christmas Day.
But, as the sea, whose tide has climbed and roared,
slamming the seawall, draws its warring waves
down and away, so he, in haste, withdrew
from his own high and solemn victory.
It was not God, but only time, mere Time
that called him. The young tribe of giant waves
will bear the burden of his flight until
it strikes the far edge of its flowering fringe,
to bid a slow farewell, breaking against
the limit of the earth. Exuberant
in strength,-it laughs, a January gulf
in that dry land of days where we remain.
Are they then maidens? One cannot be sure:
pain and not passion has defined their sex.
One seems an Adam, turning half away,
but, judging by his flow of hair, an Eve ...
America, where he was born and raised,
and England, where he died - they both incline
their drowsy faces as they stand, dejectedly,
on either side of his enormous grave.
And ships of cloud swim slowly heavenward.
But each grave is the limit of the earth.
Forests here will not forget
voice of lyre and rush of feet.
Only what remains alive
will deserve their memories.
Hill and dale will honor him.
Aeolus will guard his fame.
Blades of grass his name will hold,
just as Horace had foretold.
Thomas Stearns, don't dread the sheep,
or the reaper's deadly sweep.
If you're not recalled by stone,
puffball drift will make you known.
Thus it is that love takes flight.
Once for all. Into the night.
Cutting through all words and cries,
seen no more, and yet alive.
You have gone where others are.
We, in envy of your star,
call that vast and hidden room,
thoughtlessly, "the realm of gloom."
. Wood and field will not forget.
All that lives will know you yet -
as the body holds in mind
lost caress of lips and arms.
