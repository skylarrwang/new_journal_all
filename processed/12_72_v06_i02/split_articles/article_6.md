**The most hated man in New Mexico; the most misunderstood man in New Haven**

"This is the 430th anniversary of our 
new breed. 'I will lead you out of 
Egypt,' God said to Moses, and af-
ter 430 years, the Hebrews came out 
of Egypt and into Caanan ... 
... The Spanish-American is only four-. 
and-a-half years old, while the Anglo 
is 25 years old, and the Jew is 60 
years old ... By the year 2000 we will 
have 600 million people who speak 
Spanish down across the Rio 
Grande." 

What had happened to "El Tigre del 
Norte" (The Tiger of the North)---"The 
most hated man in New Mexico?" To 
those who sat in the sparsely filled Law 
School Auditorium several weeks ago, 
the words of the reputed Chicano revolu-
tionary, Reies Lopez Tijerina, were 
blander than the pablum of traditional 
American politics. 

Where was the man, Tijerina, who set 
his followers on fire, leading the fight to 
reclaim the Spanish land grants of the 
Southwest? Where was the man who 
took over a national forest in New Mex-
ico, warning, "We'll stay here until "'e 
come to a showdown with whoever feels 
he has the right to throw us out." The 
man who supposedly led the raid on the 
courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, in which 
two policemen were wounded? 

As the spectators in the Law School 
Auditorium shifted uncomfortably in 
their seats, the carefully cultivated at-
mosphere of logic and reason crumbled 
before the tangled rhetoric of the man 
behind the podium. Tijerina's formal 
lecture, delivered in a second language, 
succeeded only in embarrassing the Chi-
cano audience and their invited guests. 

There was a vast chasm between Tijerina 
the man, and the political revolutionary 
the audience had expected. 

Reies Tijerina hasn't changed. His 
speech was nearly th~ same, word for 
word, as the one he gave more than six 
years ago in Sante Fe, when he drew an 
analogy comparing the Tribes of Israel 
to the lndo-Rispanos in the Southwest. 
He remains a man of the soil, a man who 
speaks with passion and sincerity from 
tht' heart, not the sort of individual with 
whom the academically oriented Chicano 
Yalies could identify. The gap between 
audience and speaker was too great. The 
undergraduates who listened· so half-
heartedly were only junior high and high 
school students during the height of Ti-
jerina's career. When he spoke of the 
"miracle" of the " Indo-Hispanic" popu-
lation boom, could an audience so fa-
miliar with Zero Population Growth and 
Women's Liberation be sympathetic? 

To Tijerina, the former Pentecostal 
preacher, the miracle of life represented 
by the teeming millions of lndo-Hispanos 
indicates a heaven-sent mission for the 
Chicano culture--and for himself. In the 
fall of 1969, jailed on dubious charges of 
aiding and abetting his wife in the destruc-
tion of Forest Service signs and of assault-
ing a forest ranger, he wrote from his 
cell: 

I am writing these reflections to my 
people and the entire Indo-Hispanic 
world-Latin America ... Times have 
changed and the spirit of the blood 
is no longer limited by national or con-
tinental boundaries ... Our property, 
freedom and culture must be respect-
ed on New Mexico, in South America, 
Mexico and Canada. 

If this view seems somewhat grandiose, 
it is not out of personal bravado. In 1957 
Tijerina had a vision and thereafter view-
ed.himself as a messenger of God in the 
tradition of the Hebrew prophets: 

I left my warm bed into the cold 
weather because I wanted to pray ... 
I wanted to ask God co show me the 
future of my life. I fell asleep, and I 
saw frozen horses and this old King-
dom with walls, you know, and these 
tall pines. The horses started melting 
and coming to life, and three angels 
came in my dream to my house to 
help me ... 

Those tall pines, they were in New 
Mexico, the three angels were the an-
gels of the law coming to tell me what 
I should do. And the frozen horses, 
they were the land grants that be-
longed to the pueblos, to my people ... 
I had found my calling, like a mission. 

The Law School Auditorium echoed 
with mystical interpretations of history: 
Tijerina explained the cracking of the 
Liberty Bell as God's message to America 
to end its oppression of the black man. 
He linked the return of his people to their 
land in the Southwest to the return of 
the Tribes of Israel to the Holy Land. 
He went on to attach religious signifi-
cance to the 3 PM June 5, 1967 attack 
on the Tierra Amarilla courthouse, which 
occured at the same moment as the Is-
raeli attack on Jerusalem which began 
the Six Day War halfway around the 
world. The fact that he and Moshe Day-
an, the man who ordered the Israeli 
attack, were born on the same day fur-
ther confirmed his mission. 

If Tijerina was always a religious 
mystic, how then did his image as a po-
litical revolutionary catch on? The an-
swer seems to lie with Tijerina's work in 
· the Alianza Federal de Mercedes Libres 
{the Federal Alliance of Free City-
States). Founded in 1963 at the urgings 
of Tijerina's inner voices, the Alianza's 
purpose was to settle a 120-year-old dis-
pute by regaining the land which the 
Spanish settlers held before the Anglo 
conquest. The grievance began when Mex-
ico signed over Arizona and New Mexico 
to the United States in the Treaty of 
Guadalupe-Hidalgo. At that time, the 
Anglos had agreed to honor the private 
land holdings in New Mexico that had 
been given to the Spanish settlers by the 
Mexican viceroys. Inevitably, the Texan 
"gringos" began to move in, taking the 
land from the illiterate and clannish 
colonists, sometimes through violence 
and other times through legal skuldug-
gery. After fifty years the U.S. Supreme 
Court validated all existing land titles and 
tossed out the old Hispano claims. 

By late 1966, Tijerina claimed an 
Alianza membership of 30,000, and the 
sympathetic attachment of many thou-
sands more. The Alianza membership 
was not made up ~f militant young 
Chicanos, but of middle-aged and older 
people who considered themselves 
Spanish {not Mexican-American, Indo-
Hispano, or Chicano). Many of Tijerina's 
early followers could still remember how 
the land their families and pueblos owned

had been systematically appropriated by 
shyster Anglo lawye~ who preyed upon 
the Hispano unfamiliarity with the laws 
of the American conquerors. The 
Alianza was not a revolutionary organiza-
tion-its concern was the relatively narrow 
issue of land. Even the wife of New Mex-
ico's Governor Cargo was a member. 

Pursuing his dream, Tijerina organized 
a symbolic 65-mile hike from Albuquer-
que to Santa Fe in July, 1966, to peti-
tion the government for more civil and 
property rights for Spanish-speaking 
Americans. Then, with 350 men, women 
and children, he "took over" Carson Na· 
tiona) Forest (a former land grant) and 
held a mock trial of three forest rangers. 
Although the group eventually left peace· 
fully and released the rangers, Tijerina 
was arrested and later convicted of 
assaulting a Federal officer. The press 
began to describe him as the "leader of 
the militant land grant claimants." His 
reputation spread. 

In June, 1967, Tijerina's followers 
attempted to hold a convention in the 
Carson forest, but were thwarted by the 
local District Attorney, Alphonso San-
chez, who believed Tijerina had Commu-
nist support in his activities. Sanchez, 
who had frequently interfered with the 
AJianza's organizational efforts, arrested 
ten of its leaders to discourage attendance 
of the convention. In response, a group 
of armed AJianza members raided the 
nearby courthouse in Tierra Amarilla in 
an attempt to make a citizen's arrest of 
Sanchez, who was not present. Never-
theless, the corps of Alianza members 
managed to free their ten companeros, 
leaving behind a wounded state police-
man and a deputy sheriff. The author-
ities overreacted and sent 350 national 
guardsmen, state police, and heavy mil-
itary equipment in pursuit. 

The Tierra Amarilla raid, then, was 
not the initial battle of a revolution aim· 
ing to wrest the Southwest from the 
grasp of the gringo. Tijerina became a 
cause celebre, and a "revolutionary lead-
er" through the state's response to the 
raid and the interpretation given to the 
incident by the emerging milita.nt fac-
tion of the Chicano movement. 

Those who view the man as a fiery-
eyed John Brown should not forget that 
he has steadfastly maintained his inno-
cence in connection with the raid: 

"I was in the Coyote area at the time, 
and heard about it on the radio." If his 
denials are not enough, Tijerina, acting 
in his own defense, was acquitted in De-
cember, 1967, of all charges connecting 
him with the raid. 

Exultant in his victory, Tijerina told 
the press: 

My philosophy is that of the cricket 
against the lion. The cricket is the 
king of the insects and the lion is 
king of the beasts. The cricket has 
no chance against the lion so he jump-
ed into the lion's ear and tickled him 
to death. That's what we're going to 
do to the United States-we're going 
to tickle him to death. 

But when Tijerina was asked if he styled 
himself after Emilio Zapata, he said: "I 
admire his work, but I admire the work 
of Moses more." 

Two years later, after beingjailed in 
connection with the burning of a forest 
sign, Tijerina went on to state in a letter 
to the Indo-Hispanic people: 

I pray to God that all the Indo-His-
panic people will awake to the need 
for unity, and to our heavenly and 
constitutional responsibility for fzght-
ing peacefully to win our rights. 

Still, his revolutionary image con-
tinued to grow out of all proportion. In 
March, 1968, the California Peace and 
Freedom Party briefly named Tijerina as 
its vice-presidential running rriate for com-
edian-activist Dick Gregory. That same 
month in a speech at the University of 
New Mexico, Gregory said that Negroes 
would burn the country down house by 
house. Tijerina told reporters immed-
iately afterward: "We don't condone 
violence. There has been too much talk 
of revolution. We hope to change the 
state with moral and legal pressure." 

During his two-year incarceration di-
rectly thereafter, the AJianza gradually 
expanded the scope of its activities and 
carne closer to the social movement 
Tijerina was originally credited with 
founding. Upon his return from prison, 
Tijerina was unable to relate to the or-
ganization as it had evolved. The 
AJianza split. Now, Tijerina's main con-
cern lies with his Institute for the Study 
of Justice. 

The message of Reies Tijerina which 
has remained unchanged since his vision 
in 1957 contradicts his image as a politi-
cal revolutionary. Is it any wonder that 
the expectations of the Yale audience---
who know only of Tijerina the symbol---
were not met? That the most critical 
and skeptical segment of the audience 
was the Yale Chicano community? Since 
Tijerina fell short of their expectations, 
they regarded his present position as 
evidence of anything from a sellout, to 
an attempt to obtain a presidential par-
don for his past sins. 

The cold fact is that Tijerina's move-
ment at its height was unrepresentative 
of the Chicano movement. It was an a-
grarian movement of older people. The 
Chicano community, on the other hand, 
is the most urbanized and youngest mi-
nority group in the country. It is this 
latter group with its access to education-
al facilities which has produced the Yale 
Chicano. 

Tijerina is a mystical, Pentecostal 
preacher on a sincere but quixotic quest 
for justice. If we can accept this view, 
the response by Tijerina to a question 
from the audience can be better under-
stood: 

"Five years ago you told us to kill the 
gringo. Now you ask us to call him 
brother. Que paso?" 

"l said something about the Uberty 
Bell. Wasn't that good enough for 
you.?" e
