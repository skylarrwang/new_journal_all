Not only was it in the New York Film Festival, but the opening of Heat was an event! Sylvia was, of course, there, and Joe (migod! in a suit!), and Paul, and a host of glistening New York (nee Little Hollywood) Harry-everyone-will-be-there cinema-goers. (note: "film" is where you find it; "cinema" is for people who are desperately trying to learn Bertolucci's name). No one is sure if Andy was there or not.


They even had a special panel discussion after the screening. Otto Preminger, charter member of the Stanley Kramer Cub for film-makers who never got a hot one but make just enough each time to bankroll the next one, properly blew it by initially lauding Sylvia: "Yell, I tink Vera Miles iss excellent in zis pikture." But no one could blame Otto particularly, for after all, just what was the Factory doing at the Festival?


Well, Virginia, once upon a time ...
Lap dissolve (or, for those who still haven't read Ed Pincus' Guide to Film-making, those wavy lines that used to come on the screen when somebody was going to have a dream, a flashback, or both):


Paul Morrissey worked in a number of odd jobs before turning to film. After four years of independently made shorts (note: "Independently made" covers a multitude of film-financing routes, a euphemism for anything between starvation and being hired to make a travelogue of the Indian Neck Mills textile plant), he became a member of Andy Warhol's Factory, an "old-fashioned Hollywood" studio based in a lower Manhattan warehouse.


Morrissey served an apprenticeship with Warhol on films including My Hustler, Loves of Ondine, and Lonesome Cowboys, and was finally given free rein with Flesh. Whether Morrissey became director or Andy just became a producer is irrelevant; at any rate, the last film Andy did any "work" on was L'amour in 1970.


Flesh generated an appropriate and well-deserved stir in underground circles, and even received some notices above-ground (note: "underground" is a sloppy but commonly used term much like "experimental." It includes avant-garde before the New Wave, anything non-commercial in nature, usually films with some intelligence behind them, true experiments with the nature of the medium, too often devoid of a sense of humor, not necessarily entertaining and often boring, often failing but still trying, anything rentable from the Filmmakers' Co-op, anything written or shot by Jonas Mekas, and in France everything by Jerry Lewis. "Above-ground" refers to anything reviewed by Wanda Hale).


This was followed by Trash, also starring Joe Dallasandro, and including Holly Woodlawn and the girl-with-the-olive-oil-complexion, Jane Forth. Although it was funny and by some estimations worth seeing, Trash was a moderate commercial success. New York was treated to a massive poster publicity campaign which included stenciling the film's title in "the streets, on the curbs, and cheekily in the gutters. Whether the street advertising was responsible or not (one may assume that it helped, as many New Yorkers have their heads in that direction anyway), the film received enough box-office and critical attention that no one could deny that the underground had "arrived."


In many ways, Heat is simply the next step toward this recognition. Not only that, the films are getting better.


Now look, Virginia, pay attention ...
Heat is a semi-soft core delight. (note: "Hard-core" and "Soft-core" are terms used to describe different types of pornography, obscenity, vulgarity, fun, your choice. Simply stated, "hard core" refers to films that "deliver" -that is, no simulation, the Real Thing, Deep Throat, Daddy's 8mm workshop treasure chest of the 1956 office Christmas party. "Soft-core" means cheating, somewhere. One of the problems of the film underground's emergence in the past was the lack of this distinction among "art" films. For example, many of Warhol's films do not "deliver" in a hard-core sense, nor were they meant to; but the general reputation for years- remember being forbidden to see La Dolce Vita?- was otherwise .. Simply stated, "soft-core" refers to anything Judith Crist wouldn't be caught dead seeing. "Hard-core" refers to anything Judith Crist would only be caught dead seeing.


Morrissey: We had an idea to do The Blue Angel, but with the roles reversed, you know, Joe in the Marlene Dietrich part, but when we got to L.A., we thought thought it might be Death in Venice, with the hotel now a motel, or maybe Grand Hotel, but it finally turned out to be Sunset Boulevard.


Joey Davis, fading ex-child star, is looking for a break, residing in a run-down-but-still-pastel-colored-motel (after first checking out the ruins of the old Fox lot on, you bet, Sunset Boulevard), where he meets Jessica, a young mother who thinks she's a Lesbian, and he is soon introduced to Jessica's mother, Sally. Sally is also a fading actress, doing commercials. She falls for young, muscular Joey, and he, seeing an opportunity for career advancement, accepts. He moves into her 36-room mansion, but loses what could have been a break in his career when the producers Sally introduces him to start searching for more "Elliott Hoffmarm" types. Meanwhile, Jessica is after Joey and a few other divertissements, but Joey gives up on the whole thing and walks out. Sally goes berserk and vainly tries to shoot him. End titles. Not exactly a remake of Sunset Boulevard, but it's in there enough to be significant.


The best thing about Heat, and the thing that makes it work, is that the Technique/style Morrissey has been using all along has finally flowered. Not only has he assembled actors that can improvise well, but his editing sense has developed to the point where a true wit emerges through the comic gems he chooses to in-
