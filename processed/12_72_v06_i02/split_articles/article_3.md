elude in the film. Granted, there is no 
script, therefore the "jokes" in the dia-
logue belong to the actors, but the order-
ing and structuring of those lines belong 
to Morrissey. As in Flesh and Trash, the 
camera is usually set up in one position, 
the actors are given an idea of what the 
scene is about, and they play it. The ca-
mer:a roams a bit, but essentially stays in 
one area. In Heat however, Morrissey has 
improved his skill by cutting away or 
stopping the camera completely until 
something starts to happen again. True, 
the camera did not simply roll on in Flesh 
and Trash, but the results were not nearly 
so good as they are in Heat. In addition, 
he edits scenes in several instances, going 
from a medium shot to a close-up and 
back. This alone isn't much, unless you 
keep in mind that scenes were stopped, 
or that (improvised} dialogue went on 
between camera set-ups; but the editing 
keeps the fJlm flowing smoothly within 
these cuts, as if nothing is missing. (The 
ftlm had a 5-1 ratio, footage shot to 
footage used.) And, he knows how to end 
a scene, where the end of a joke is, how 
long a reaction shot should be. While the 
film stock has a recognizable graininess 
tu it, the synch sound quality is also 
much improved over the two previosu 
ftlms. 

Mo"issey: The typewritten movie is 
over. I don't use a script, I keep it all in 
my head. (D.W. Griffith did the same 
thing.) The common conception is that 
we give everyone drugs and wait for some-
thing to happen, but I've never tried that, 
and I don't think it would work. I just 
set up a situation, give as much of an idea 
as I can without telling the actors any-
thing, and leave the camera on them. 
Films don't use actors anymore; actors 
should do more. We sort of invented this 
improvisation technique, and it's had a 
long development. 

A major share of the credit for the 
success and spice of Heat must go to the 
actors. As the story goes, Sylvia Miles 
went to enough parties and simply hung 
around long enough to get herself a part 
in the film. Fortunately so, for she is 
a major attraction. From the moment 
she appears, she is perfect: the aggressive 
waddle, big sunglasses, too-often-worked-
over blonde hair, the low-cut pants-dress 
revealing a once great figure gone slightly 
sagging but still appealing- the fading 
actress who is living on alimony, the left-
overs of her career, and the generous Cal-
ifornia sun. The finishing touches are her 
magnificent eyes, with which she can say 
more than two pages of description, and 
her hu&)<y, lots-of-booze and histrionic 
screaming-in-the-past voice. She is elec-
tric whenever she is on. Her reaction looks 
are some of the best moments in the ftlm, 
as when she is informed by the motel 
owner that she is not the only one Joey 
has been seeing: her expression goes from 
polite, disinterested superiority to seeth-
ing internal frustration and rage. And she 
has many good lines of her own, includ-
ing her confrontations with her flipped-
out daughter Jessica. As early as it is in 
the film, her exclamation, "This is Holly-
wood, darling!" is a case of supreme co-
mic understatement. Then she goes on, 
as the frustrated (albeit neglecting and 
confused} mother of a weirdo teenager 
to tell Jessica, "My dear, you are not a 
Lesbian; it's just a phase, you only think 
you are." Later, when Jessica is after Joey, 
it comes back: "She can't even make a

not know what's happening or how to 
to go further. Heat is also about family 
deal with it. Finally, the last meaningful 
problems, the American family breaking 
shot of the ftlm is just her eyes, after she 
up, the rejection of Jessica's baby (which 
tries to shoot Joey. We hear one last, 
she carries in a shopping bag), but that in
