Letters 
To the editors and readers of The New 
Journal, 
The rally held on the Green November 9th 
was the first I have seen in which students 
comprised only a small percentage of the 
participants gathered. The rally was in 
support of the Farah Pants Boycott, an 
attempt to ftght the oppression of Chicano 
workingwomen in Texas and New Mexico 
by the huge Farah Company.--- one which 
refuses to allow the formation of a union, 
preferring to have strikers arrested on ex-
orbitant bail for simple acts of picketing. 
The result? As one Chicano union organ-
izer said about his people, "We are timid--
--because we are intimidated." 


The men and women at that Saturday ral-
ly---representing a host of unions and join-
ed by YPSL---knew that the rally was only 
a minor step in the struggle to transform 
America into a land of justice. I was proud 
because unlike the people at many student-
oriented political rallies, those I was among 
would not be easily disillusioned and quit, 
because they started out with no illusions 
about the society they struggled against 
and the measures needed to produce 
change within it. 


Now that the anti-serious New Left has 
faded into waterbeds, beer and "tranquil-
ity," it is easy enough for students tore-
turn to a life of isolation from society. So 
it shouldn't be too much to ask for stu-
dents not to do something. For those 
who support the right of poor workers 
to organize and live decently, the thing to 
do is Not Buy Farah Pants--at Macy's, 
Malley's, and wherever strikebreaking 
stores continue to order them. Don't 
buy injustice.
