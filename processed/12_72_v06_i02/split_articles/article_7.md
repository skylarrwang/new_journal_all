After they left, me and Rose came back 
and went to playing records on the table in 
the kitchen, cause thats where the record 
player was, and I was in the bed with her 
son, and she just went to talking to me 
like I was Lonnie. Lonnie look, she said 
come on lets dance Lonnie. I'm going 
home, I got to see Lucas. I said Rose look 
this is me who the hell you talking about, 
I ain't no Lonnie. So I dance a little more 
and I drink a little more and she drink a 
little more and she called me Lonnie just 
a little bit more, and so I woke Jim up, 
that's when she went in there and sat on the 
bed, and right back on the bed and woke 
Jim up, her son, Jim, and I said, Jim, I 
said, Who Rose live with over there and 
don't tell me no lies. I want you to tell 
me the truth and he said, Lonnie lived with 
her the whole time she was ove·r there. 


I got a few more drinks and she was 
laying on the bed and I went in there and 
I pulled her off the bed. I said, Who this 
Lonnie and she said I don't know damn 
Lonnie. Good. I put her back on the bed 
and there was about half of that rum left, 
no soda, just half of the rum, and so we 
started drinking. Then she said, Lucas, this 
was her words, Lonnie look, I love you, she 
said, but Lucas, I pay his rent over there, I 
get him food and everything, but it ain't my 
house so long as Lucas's over there. 


Now, lets jump back to the street. All 
that time I was in the street they were tell-
ing me, people that knowed her and me 
were telling me, Say now, you don't have 
no old lady. Lonnie got her. So I knew 
that, but then still I didn't catch her. I 
never catch her with nobody, but I know 
she be gone some time three weeks, some 
time two weeks. Like Christmas, when she 
left, I had bought Jim a bicycle and every-
thing but she wasn't there, and Jim he 
wasn't home neither, because she takes him. 


So, I thought this; She did want me, no, 
she didn't, she really did want me, loved 
me, but she didn't want me full time she 
just want me in and out. But even the times 
she didn't want me, that woman would pay 
some place for me to stay and have the food 
too, for me to eat. I think about this now, 
God knows, I think about it and God knows 
I didn't mean to kill her. 


This is what happened, we started in the 
bed, she was naked and I was naked, she 
didn't have on a stitch or nothing because 
we just started talking in the room. And 
then Rose prided herself on that one thing, 
if she get naked and I get naked .... Now, I 
ain't hit her and she hadn't hit me, we 
were just sitting on the top of the bed, and 
we ain't made no love or nothing, we just 
sitting there like this and we arguing, we 
ain't arguing, we discussing things, before 
we get into this argument, but it's getting 
hotter all the time, you know, so I told her 
like this, I said, Rose, I said now, I hear that 
you does go with Lonnie and all the time 
you was over there. .. she said I don't know 
a Lonnie. 


Then I pulled the pint of liquor out of 
the coat pocket and she said, You ain't got 
no coke. Now she would not drink no 
coke, but also she would not drink at all 
unless I got coke to drink with mine cause 
she knowed how I can't drink without coke. 
But she had red rock cola, which wasn't 
a coke cola and I hate them imitations, you 
know. She knowed this, and she said well, 
you didn't tell me you were going to get 
rum, so the only thing in the box is that 
Red Rock. I said well, after you been out 
there with that cat all this here time, you 
couldn't even think just to get me a coke 
cola. 


So we set there looking at TV and I 
don't know what was on TV, but there 
was noise and there was a picture. So she 
said, like this, she. gets right up, after about 
five minutes, and she said, Lonnie, she said 
goddamit, she said come on and get me my 
clothes I want to go home to Lucas. 


So, I don't say nothing, because I don't 
want to shut her up. I want to hear the 
whole details. So I followed her when she 
gets up and walks to Jim's room, followed 
her. just listening, and r m bare-footed 
and she bare-footed and she got on nothing 
but her panties and she ain't got on no bra. 
So she say, say you know, Lucas going to 
kill me, he .going to kill you too. First 
thing he going to kill you. But no, she say, 
maybe he too smart, he probably got a 
bitch over there in the house now. That 
had her so worried, she talking to Lonnie 
and saying over and over, He got a woman 
there, Sally been all over there. That damn 
man, she says, he got that goddam Sal. 


Then we went to fighting. Because it, 
it got right to me that this cat has been 
living with her for three weeks and she done 
tell me I ain't got nobody I just been saving 
for you. So I just went to hitting on her. 
What you saving for me, I say, what you 
been saving. 


That was the last that I remembered 
that night. I wasn't hitting her with any· 
thing except my hands. I wasn't even hit-
ting her with my fists just at the start of it. 
And she was hitting me, I mean she was 
kicking me and she was hitting me and then 
I was drunk, cause every time she kicked 
me or hit me, I'd fall further than I thought 
I could possibly falJ, and every time I'd 
fall further and fall against the wall, further, 
I would get madder and I would come back 
with something. Maybe I just didn't want 
to fall again. 


Then she got the mop and I used the 
mop handle. When she got loose from that 
she got the broom and I got it from her and 
then I used the broom. 


One time I hit her with a chair. Be-
cause all the time I hit her I knocked her 
down, but then she'd kick me with some-
thing, so I hit her with the chair. Next I 
got, you know, I got electric cord, I had 
about fifty feet. It wasn't plugged in, 
I plugged it in this morning because I had 
to plug it in for the TV, but that was when 
I didn't know she was dead. I slept with 
her all night, but I didn't know she was 
dead. 


But then she wasn't hurt, I wasn't hurt. 
I come up with the cord and I didn't hit 
her with it, I just reached and put it round 
her throat and thats when I was dragging 
her around the floor, her head then, not 
her throat because I wasn't choking her, I 
think there was too many cords just going 
around there to choke her .... 


If you look in the trash can you'll see 
her nightgown and everything, I put that 
in there this morning and I ~opped the 
floor this morning, but I still didn't know 
she was dead. Don't get me wrong, I didn't 
know she was dead until I got through with 
all that and she still wouldn't say nothing .... 


But at the time it was before anything 
happened like she getting killed. Fifty feet 
of cord I had then and it all doubled up, so 
I just grabbed that and throwed it around 
her head and drug her in the kitchen again ... 


... blood all over the kitchen all over the 
living room, blood all over the bed, cause 
she had went in and got into the bed and 
she was running, she was running, but she 
would never tell me nothing. I said OK, I 
said, tell me, just tell me, goddarn it, cause 
I'm going to kill you if you don't. 


Well, she wouldn't tell me, so I said 
OK, I ain't going to hit her no more, she 
ain't going to tell me. Then I took her in 
the bathroom and I stuck her head under 
the cold water and I seen blood coming out 
of her nose and I hold her under there until 
blood was a-coming out, I see blood, and 
then she hold her head up again and I let 
her up, and she hold her head up, and all I 
was trying to do was not to kill her. But at 
the same time then when I was saying to my-
self how not to kill her, I was saying I would 
kill her: out loud, I was repeating to her, I'll 
kill you, I'll kill you, kill you, and whe.n she 
get up, and blood in that water and every-
thing, I wiped her face and I said well, you 
got something to tell me, and she say, No I 
don't Lucas. I didn't do it. 


When I come back with half a pint 
she's laying in the tub. I come back there 
and I hit her on the shoulder. Come on, I 
said come on get in bed, and she got up and 
walked to that bed, and that was something 
about 3:00 when I walked her to bed. 


Then all I know that this, that she said 
she was hurting, but she was walking when 
she went to bed. 


Come morning when I wake, I cried . 
I cried, I tried to beg her pardon, cause I 
didn't think she was dead. I thought she did 
.vhat she always do, she was playing possum. 
Then I went in and ftxed Jim something to 
eat, but all this time I kept feeling she was 
getting colder and colder, and so I opened 
her mouth with her teeth and everything 
and then I set her hand a different way, and 
still she had it that way. She was getting 
colder and I ftgured she was dead and I told 
her I was sorry. 


But I wouldn't tell Jim, I knowed I 
had to get him out of there. So I brought 
Sam on over to the Avenue and the ftrst 
person I run into was her brother. I didn't 
tell him, cause I wanted some time to be 
able to walk down town ... .l did kill some-
body and I thought maybe when you kill 
somebody you're dangerous and I wanted 
to walk in, so I left her brother, and I told 
a friend of mine and he said don't go down-
town, and I said I got to, and he said no, she 
probably up over there now cooking there. 
Well, I said, I ain't got no key, I left the key 
in the house, the key is in the house, and he 
said, well I'm going to check. He took off 
then, and I went with him up to half a 
block from the house, but then I turn and 
run, and I come straight downtown. 


That's all I know now, that's the 
truth in my best knowledge. I was whup-
ping her, I wasn't killing her. She just went 
to bed with me. I took her to bed, and she 
didn't talk with me, she just come into bed, 
and said I'm hurting. I didn't believe that 
she was hurting as moch as she said, because 
I know if she stay up that long she couldn't 
be hurting like that. But then when I woke 
up and she was dead, I tried everything to 
wake her but she was dead. This ain't only 
sorry now. I'm .. .l'm '6filling to give my 
life. I think I was wrong, but now I know 
not only that, but that she knowed that I 
was killing her at the time. And that's 
what hurts so, is that she knowed I was 
killing her, and how it took so long. What 
really makes me wrong is how what I was 
asking her to do was just admit that she 
was wrong and there I was and I was doing 
all the wrong.
