"Oh. they don't have majors." 

"They don't," Mark said. 

"No, they have areas of concentration. 
One concentrates on the faith or· on the 
... denomination of his choice. Well ac-
. tually I suppose it's the same thing." 

"Sure. What was your area?" 

"Well ... Until a short while ago, I 
was concentrating on Calvinist Theology. 
Especiall)' on the theology of the Dutch 
Reformed Church. And also on the his-
tory of the Dutch Reformed Church. I've 
studied ... For three and a half years I 
concentrated on the theology and the his-
· tory of the Dutch Reformed Church." 

"Uh-huh. What'd you switch to? 
What's your area now?" 

"Oh, you wanted ... I changed, yes. 
Just a short while ago." 

Mark ran his fingers through his hair, 
looking at the rear-view mirroe, then back 
to the road. "Uh-huh. To what, was what 
I wanted to know." 

"Oh. Yes. To Catholic theology. From 
Calvinist ... From Dutch Reformed." 

Paul turned back to the window. 

Mark glanced at Paul, then wiped his 
mouth, looking back to the road. 

They drove a while without speaking. 

Mark changed positions every few mo-
ments, frequently massaging his wrists 
and his neck, and occasionally looking 
over at Paul, who did not shift his gaze 
from the window for perhaps a quarter of 
an hour. At the end of this time he looked 
down and absently retrieved the permit, 
which had fallen to the floor-board of the 
car. He stared at it for a moment before 
suddenly turning to Mark. "Do you know, 
are you at all familiar with the history of 
the Dutch Reformed Church? In, for ex-
ample, South Africa? Do you know it's 
history?" 

Mark looked at Paul for a long mo-
ment. The car began to swerve, and he 
turned back to the road. " Uh, no. No, I'm 
not. Why do you ask?" 

"The Dutch Reformed Church has 
been the most powerful ... has been re-
sponsible, almost single-handedly, for 
every ... action, taken by South Africa, 
for the past three hundred years. Do you 
know that?" 

Mark took a slow breath. "No, uh-uh." 

"Slavery, for example, has been sup-
ported, vehemently advocated by the lead-
ing voices in the Church. Not only ... 
The Church has sanctioned the suppres-
sion, not only of the blacks, but of the 
Indians, the half-castes ... The Church 
has sanctioned the suppression of their 
rights. Did you know that?" 

"I ... you know, just what I read ... " 

"Oh, I know you might raise questions 
about the English. The fact that South 
Africa was an English colony." 

Mark rubbed the back of his neck. 

"Right. Right." 

"But the English have never involved 
themselves in South Africa's ... internal 
affairs. The English ... historically, the 
English have been concerned with South 
Africa only as a refueling station. For 
their ships. They settled only in the coas-
tal areas: But the Dutch, you see, carne to 
settle the land. They weren't ... the 
Dutch carne to live. Eventually they oc-
cupied the whole of the interior." 

Mark shifted in his seat. "There it is." 

"And then, you see, when the Suez 
Canal was built, why the English lost in-
terest. During virtually the whole of the 
nineteenth century, the English ... So 
that really it was not the English at all. 
It was the Dutch, the Boers, who were ... 
responsible." Paul turned to Mark. "Do 
you see?" 

"The Boers." 

"Exactly." 

"Hey Paul ... " 

"And it was the faith of Calvin which 
was the structuring ... force. In their lives. 
It was ... Are you familiar at all with Cal-
vinism. With its doctrines?". 

"No. Not intimately, no. Hey, Paul, lis-
ten to me for a second. I mean, don't mis-
understand me, I'm interested in this, you 
know, under ordinary circumstances. But 
I mean, I'm kind of tired right now, and I 
thought ... I mean let's talk, you know, 
but I'm not up to anything too heavy." 

Paul stared at Mark for a second, then 
loqked down. "I'm ... sorry. I shouldn't 
1be ... I was very ... involved, with the 
Church, for some time. I shouldn't ... " 

"No, I mean, ordinarily ... " 

"I'm certain you have your own ... 
concerns. I shouldn't ... And I, too, I 
suppose, should concern myself ... " 

Paul fell silent. 

Mark glanced over at him. "Hey, don't 
... I mean, let's talk, you know. I just 
meant if we could lighten up." 

Paul did not reply. 

After a moment, Mark nodded. "Paul." 

When Paul dtd not respond Mark shook 
his head. "Oh, Paul." 

Paul turned to him. "I'm sorry. I 
wasn't ... " 

Mark sank down in the seat. "Is, uh, 
predestination, is that ... God, this is 
" 

"Excuse me?" 

"Is predestination, I mean I'm kind of 
a free-lance Episcopalian, but aren't the 
Calvinists ... Isn't predestination ... " 

"Double predestination. Double ... " 

"Double. Right." 

" ... election." Paul turned so that he 
faced Mark. "The Calvinists believe not 
only ... not only that God elects certain 
souls for salvation, but also that He elects 
those who are to be damned. Did you ... 
They believe ... Well don't you see? 
Where does the idea of election first ap-
pear? Among what people?" 

"The Jews, right?" 

"The Israelites. Among the twelve 
tribes of Israel. The idea of election frrst 
appears among the tribes who call them-
selves the People of the Covenant." Paul 
paused for a moment. "Now when the 
Boers, the Trek-Boers they were called, 
when they went into the interior .. . 
Well, it was natural, given their ... theo-
logy, given the idea of election, it was in-
evitable they should begin to see parallels. 
Between themselves, and the children of 
Israel. Lost in the wilderness, wander-
ers ... 

"The literature is ... I've seen them, 
you know. I've studied their diaries, and 
many of them contain outright ... as-
sertions. That the Boers had been one of 
the lost tribes, had been scattered, and 
were now reunited. I've seen ... And when 
they encountered the Bantu? When they 
first made contact with the tribes of the 
Ama-Xhosa, in the Orange River valley? 
Who, logically, must ... Well if the Boers 
were to be the people of the Covenant, 
elected by God, chosen by him to be His 
people, who, logically, must the Bantu 
be?" 

Mark turned. ''The Philistines." 

"The Canaanites. Of course. Trespas-
sers on the land of Israel. Usurpers of the 
land of milk and honey, promised to Is-
rael by the Lord." Paul sat back in his 
seat. After a moment his gaze moved to 
the window. "For three hundred years 
the Boers have suppressed the Bantu, in-
voking scripture, citing the Calvinist the-
ologians, while the Church ... " They

was a mile ahead. Mark checked the gas 
gauge. " . · .. has capitulated. Not capitu-
lated. The Church has been one of the as-
vocates, the foremost advocate of the i-
dea." 

"Hey Paul." 

"Of course this phenomenon ... We 
see this pattern repeated among the Cal-
viitists everywhere. Among .. . The only 
difference is, they've never ... in any 
other area, they've never gained power. 
Not on a scale ... In other areas, a cos· 
mopolitan culture develops, surrounds 
them, and the process is ... confined. 
But it is repeated. On a smaller scale, to be 
be sure ... But in Grand Rapids, for ex-
ample ... It is repeated. The persecutions

.. Well, I'd like, if you don't mind waiting, 
I'd like a pastry." 

"Hey, no, sure." 

"If you'd rather not..." 

"No, cook. C'mon, you pick one out 
for me ... 

Paul looked at him. "Oh, 1..." 

"No, go ahe'ad." 

Paul turned to the pastry tray. "Well, 
this looks like an apple, here. And I think 
this is a cheese. Would you like ... " Paul 
turned to Mark. "Would you like ... " 

"You're the boss." 

Paul turned back to the tray. "Well, 
this is ... No, this is another apple. And these 
over here I think are blueberries. Which if 
they are, are my personal favorites." 

"Two blueberries, you're on." 

Paul quickly put a pastry on each of two 
plates, and handed one to Mark. They 
carried them, along with their coffee, to the 
cash-register. Paul put his food down and 
reached into his pockets. 

Mark had three quarters in his hand.

Paul smiled too, and ate a piece of

Fine." He sipped his coffee. "Well, and
you're on vacation now, are you? You're
out of scbool now?"

Mark did not speak for a moment. He
lowered his eyes. "Ah, the irony of it all.
I fall upon the thorns ... The flagellation of it all."

"I'm sorry. I'm afraid ... "

"In the sense that school is out, in that
particular sense I am on a vacation." Mark
took a hesitant breath. "Look, are you
done? Let's ... Would you mind if we left
now? I'm in kind of a hurry."

Paul rose quickly. "No, not at all. I
didn't realize ... Of course."

Mark got up too, draining the remnant
of his coffee. He put the cup down, and
raised the collar of his coat, then stretched,
shivering. "Are you ready?"

"Yes. Certainly."

"Then we shall be on our way."

They got back on the King's Highway.
The snow had slackened somewhat, and
road conditions were better, so that Mark
was able to make up some of the time lost
during the earlier part of the trip. After
perhaps twenty minutes driving they passed
a sign indicating that Toronto was
seventeen miles distant, and the airport
twenty-three. Mark asked Paul whether
it would be all right if he were to drop him
at an exit for Toronto instead of taking
him into the city, he had to meet a plane.
Paul replied that that would be fine, but
did not respond to Mark's inquiry as to
which exit would be best for him. When
Mark repeated the question he finally
answered that the truth was, he didn't
know, he wasn't familiar with the city.
Mark looked over at him, then began to
drum his fingers on the steering-wheel.
"What do you mean? Did you just move
up here?"

Paul hesitated for a moment before
speaking. "No, that's not...Actually any
exit is fine."

"Well, but which one? The airport's on
the_ other side ~f tow'!~ I can drop you at
wh!~hever one IS best.
Uh, actually I don't...Toronto is not
my ... final destination."

"What, are you going further north?"

"No, I'm .. .headed, ultimately, for
Grand Rapids. In Michigan."

Mark kept his _ey~ on the road. Finally he rolled down his wmdo~, and tur~ed the
heater off, then cleared his throat.
"I want you to correct me if I'm wrong here

No, I m afraJd ... l ve never had a

"And I have no checks. Which leaves
us where?"

"Well ... "

"Behind the eight-ball Paul, as the
saying goes. Holding our own." Mark
rubbed the back of his hand against his
mouth. "Urn, I can't believe ... For
Christ's sake, why would you ... Look, I
don't know how ... Are you sure you're
all right? I mean, I know you're upset,
that's very understandable, with a death
and all, but, uh, are you sure you're in
control of yourself!"

"I am ... Yes, 1 am in control of my-
self." Paul's voice rose. "Why would
you .. .I made an error. Of course I am in
control of myself."

" I mean, you know, before we had
coffee you delivered this long disserta-
tion on South Africa, which, I am pretty
sleepy, did not appear to me to have
much to do with the price of eggs. Which
leads me, combined with your broken
compass ... "

" I was attempting ... The history of the
Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa
.. .1 was using that history to illustrate a
similar ... pattern in other areas. In, for
example, Grand Rapids. To illustrate the
reasons which lead to my ... reallignment."

"All right. No one is questioning ... "

"To explain why Catholicism is the
true and proper faith."

"Paul, I'm not trying to fault your
reasoning or anything. I was only point-
ing out that its ... relevance, you know, was
pretty vague, to whatever we were
discussing. I wasn't..."

"Catholicism is the faith of ... forgiveness.
Catholicism teaches, is predicated on,
apprehension of the miracle of Grace. On
the miracle of Christ's intervention.
Catholicism frees man of his legacy. It
frees man of his inheritance of sin."

Mark took a deep breath. "Paul, look.
Why don't you come with me to the
airport and we'll work something out,
okay? Maybe my brother'll have mooey.
Okay? Why don't you relax, get some
sleep or something, until we get to the
airport."

Paul stared at Mark. "You do not feel
that that isn't so? You do not believe
that?"

"I have no opinion. Honest to God
Paul. Just relax, all right?"

"Are you, perhaps, a Calvinist?"

Uh, I
"I am not. .. a Calvinist. 1 am not a
Calvinist. Relax."

"Do you think .. .It is an indefensible ...
Calvinism by emphasizing the idea of
works either as the source or for
example, to cite ... or as a m'anifestation, of
election, as the ... Dutch Reformed Church,
happens to do, Calvinism has made mao,
has endowed man with an unbearable
sense of ... responsibility. Man, unaided ...
Uving with that responsibility must
destroy either ... either the faculty of mer-
cy or, if the burden ... Or the faculty of
belief. In the possibility of goodness.
Man ... cannot accept that."

They passed the first of the exits for
Toronto. Mark wetted his Hps and the
roof of his mouth. "Well, we're almost
there. We're almost there."

"But Catholicism, on the other hand ...
Through Catholicism through its
institutions, Christ di~penses, eternally,
forgiveness of man's sinfulness. And
through forgiving, permits.:.transcen-
dance. Of the sorrow of mortality. Fini-
tude. Permits man to accept himself. His
own nature." Paul took a hesitant breath.
"Do you see? Do you understand that?"

"I do Paul. Hang on."

Paul stared at Mark. ''Do you see

"I do. Yes."

"Are you ... "

"No. Honest to God." Mark's teeth
had begun to chatter. "Take it easy."

"My father. .. could not see that. My
father." Paul looked down. "My father
could not see that. My father eould not
forgive me that. My belief. My father
could not..." Paul again turned to the
window.

Mark looked over at him. He was
silent for a moment, then sank down in
the seat, and said that the next sou~d
heard would be that of the breaking dawn.
After a moment Paul turned halfway
'round in his seat, facing the window.
"Christ...will forgive. Christ will forgive
me. Christ...To show us this, He willed
his crucifixion between the murderer and
the thief. To show that he could forgive
us ... even murder. Even ... "

"That's not so Paul. You didn't..."

" ... crimes such as murder. That he
could forgive ... even murder." Paul looked
down. "Do you suppose He would
forgive ... He will not forgive. We can nev-
er be sure that he will forgive."

"Sure He will. Don't...Paul, it's going
to be all right. Hey."

"We can never be sure you see. It is
possible that even ... even the Dutch
Reformed, for example .. .It is possible
that they are correct. That their beliefs ... "

They passed a road marker indicating
that the airport was a half-mile distant.
"Paul ... "

" ... They may be, you know. We must
not. .. "

"Now give yourself some slack."

" ... condemn them. In fact..Jt is true,
you know, that all of their beliefs are
based on Scripture. Even ... The suppres-
sion of the Bantu, for example, is based,
justified by Scripture. By the story of
Ham. Did you know that? That the
children of ... "

"Paul, please ... "

" ... Ham were cursed for his sin? That
they were cursed by the Lord to be hew-
ers of wood, and drawers of water, for
his sin? Did you know that? That the
Lord cursed Ham and his children, for-
ever?"

"No. Hey Paul ... "

"Did you know that?"

Mark took the turn-off for the airport.

Mark looked over to Paul. "No, I
didn't. I dfdn't...k.now ... that."


"No, I. . .Paul, listen ... "

"Did you?"

"No." No. God." Mark shivered.
"What, uh, what for? Why did God curse
Ham?" Mark parked the car, then slump-
ed in his seat.

"Ham failed of respect to his father.
Ham ridiculed his father's drunkeness."

Mark turned, staring at Paul, but did
not reply.

"Ham came upon his father in shame,
and did not shield his eyes. Seeing him
drunk and naked, Ham called his brothers
to witness."

Mark flashed a wan smile. "Come on."

"The curse was uttered becaus.e the son
failed of respect to the father."

"That is merely an unfortunate ...
juxtaposition. I do not choose ... "

Paul opened the door on his side. "The
Lord cursed ... The Lord does not forgive.
The Lord works through curses. The
Lord has .. .': He got out of the car.
"Paul now wait. Even ... " Mark slid
across the seat, half-rising from the car,
and took Paul's arm. "Hey."

"No! I am not fit...l am unclean.''

"Usten .. .'' Mark rose from the car,
holding Paul's arm.

"No!" Paul tried to push Mark down.
Mark struggled for a moment, then slip-
ped on the wet snow. His feet went out
from under him, and he fell forward,
striking his head against the side of the
door. He went to his knees, his right hand
hand moving to cover a long gash on his
forehead.

Paul took a step backward, looking
down at him. "You ... Oh my Lord, are
you all right?"

Mark was silent, staring dully at the
drops of blood which fell to the snow
from between his fingers. Finally,
without looking up, he said "Get away
from me. Get out of here."

"Oh my ... "

"You crazy bastard. Get out of here."

Paul got to one knee. "Shall I..." He
reached for his hankerchief. "Here.
Please."

"Get out. I mean it."

Paul did not move for a short while
longer, than lay the hanker chief in the
snow and rose very slowly. "I'm sorry.
Please forgive me."

Mark did not reply, and kept his eyes
down staring at the blood on the snow.
After a moment Paul began to weep,
biting his forefinger, and started through
the parking-Jot toward the road that led
to the King's Highway.
