THIS YEAR, THE YALE OFFICE OF 
Facilities will spend approximately 
half a million dollars on grass. Its 
Grounds Maintenance division 
will sow roughly half a ton of seed. 
The total budget for these and other 
beautification efforts will amount to 
$5.8 million. c'We have to remember 
that we're in the middle of a city," 
says one maintenance worker. "Our 
job is to try and keep the campus 
as green as possible." At Yale, the 
grass isn't greener on the other side 
of the fence 
it's greener where 
there's money to pay for it. 

Last year, in an attempt to re-
duce operating costs, the Office of 
Facilities merged the management of 
Science Hill and central campus, cre-
ating a single office responsible for 
overseeing all campus grounds. It is, 
as Ground Manager Walter Debboli 
puts it, "a-difficult job." 

Tucking his 
shoulder-length 
grey hair behind his ears, Debboli 
summarizes his department's con-
tribution to the Yale community: 
"The next time someone throws a 
party and there's beer and vomit all 
over the lawn, you'll wake up in the 
morning and it's gone." 

He leans in conspiratorially and 
grins. "That's us." 

Debboli's office is less like an 
adrninistrative building than an 
oversized tool shed. Its dust-cov-
ered windows overlook twin ga-
6 
rage doors whose dented aluminum 
bears the street number in neon 
orange spray paint. Several green-
houses, a variety of sprinklers, and 
scattered gardening equipment litter 
the perimeter. Inside is a necropolis 
of outdated machinery. Dismantled 
lawnmowers line the cobwebbed 
• walls. The skeleton of a rusty Zam-
boni lords over the concrete floor, 
illuminated by what sparse sunlight 
manages to filter through the grimy 
windowpanes. 

The 
cluttered 
headquarters 
bears the mark of a single man 
working a two-personjob. The im-
mense blueprint for the Trumbull 
renovation takes up an entire chair, 
its pages draped over the cushioned 
seat. Debboli tends two phones at 
once, answering one at his work-
station before crossing the room to 
answer the other. As updates from 
his staff pour in, he delivers instruc-
tions on the fly, relaying messages to 
his crews across campus. 

''We get paper requests from all 
departments,, he says, holding up a 
leaflet. An overgrown patch of flow-
ers, it seems, has blocked a pathway 
at the Divinity School and needs to 
be trimmed. "Sometimes I get in-
volved," he says. If there's too much 
to ~e done, he'll go to the site with 
the workmen he oversees. 

Aided by a staff of 29, Debboli 
divides his crew into four area-spe-
cific groups and distributes the de-
partment's six riding mowers, four 
large walk-behind mowers and ap-
proximately two dozen smaller push 
mowers accordingly. Displaced but 
unfazed by the perennial construc-
tion, Grounds Maintenance must 
adhere to stringent seasonal time-
lines, synchronizing immediate con-
cerns 
the dangerously lush flora of 
the Divinity School with the in-
flexible dates of reunions and gradu-
ation, events whose grounds he must 
perfectly prepare before Yalies pour 
in to trample on the work. 

While lawns must be main-
tained, recycling carried out, and 
snow shoveled, the University still 
entertains loftier dreams for the 
natural splendor of its campus. ''We 
used to have a kind of fruit salad 
type of landscape,, Debboli says, 
referring to the diverse agricultural 
. agendas of his immediate predeces-
sors. "But now · we're going back 
to a more traditional look., In the 
1940s and so·s, ·landscape architect 
Beatrix Farrand designed a com-
plete campus planting system for 
Yale, outlining what kinds of shrubs 
could be planted and where. The list 
of accepted plants consists primarily 
of species native to the New Haven 
area dogwoods, crabapples, shad-
ows, and climbing shrubs, meant to 
beautify. the sides of dorms and aca-
demic buildings. This traditional 
focus on local flora is reinforced by 
the school's greener philosophy to 
maintain a "Sustainable Landscape., 

"The Administration's been push-
ing ~his word around a lot,, says 
Debboli, "But it ends up being less 
work for us. Local species better re-
sist cold and disease, and therefore 
require less pesticide and water." 

The administration may be 
invested in marrying Yale's values 
with its appearance, but Debboli 
is not motivated by a lofty ideol-
ogy. Instead, the supervisor con-
fides, he does it for the children: "I 
don't see students as problems, but 
as guests or customers. They're 
here for an education, but also an 
experience. Playing Frisbee may 
not be great for a lawn, but if you 
want to throw a ball around, God 
bless you."
