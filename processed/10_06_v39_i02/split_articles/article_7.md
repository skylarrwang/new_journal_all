IN THE BASEMENT OF THE YALE 
College Bookstore, wedged be-
tween a pastel selection of knick-
knacks, paper wastebaskets, and 
Vera Bradley paisley, there stands 
an oft-ignored makeup counter. 
Alongside dress hangers, computer 
cords, and bathmats, the Clinique 
makeup counter cements the Yale 
Bookstore,s reputation as a veri-
table Co-op, selling everything a 
student needs to succeed . 


Wait we need makeup? 


Most Yalies are completely un-
aware of the counter,s existence. 
' 
. 
Kledia M yrtolli asked herself the 
other day as she walked by it, 
c'Why? Why is it here? Is there ever 
.anyone hen!?, 


The Clinique counter is indeed 
a curiosity. Yalies often ignore it 
in their typically pointed quests to 
seek and purchase, · but they occa-
sionally stop and cock their heads. 
The counter does not call attention 
to- itself. The calming tones of its 
products are upstaged by flanking 
piles of typical gift-shop merchan-
dise 
mugs that read "Mr. Wonder-
ful, and posters of a beer-chugging 
John Belushi. It is a lonely, fre-
quently unmanned, indistinguish-
able island of perfume and mascara. 


Heather Butler recalled seeing a 
sign at the counter that encouraged 
her to ask questions, declaring "We 
Can ;I-Ielp You,, but the space was 
deserted. "I was confused. Doesn,t 
it say they can help you?, Cus-
tomers seeking skin solutions peer 
around for a Clinique "clinician, 
in vain 1,1ntil, to their surprise, a 
regular bookstore attendant mate-
rializes behind the register. In addi-
tion to the undefined nature of the 
counter attendants, the relationship 
between the Yale Bookstore and 
the Clinique counter is confusing . 


Neither the Clinique technicians 
nor the Bookstore,s manager were 
willing to go on the record clarify-
ing the relationship . 


Nationally, 
Clinique 
culti-
vates a certain image for itself. It is 
known as the brand that places a 
grid on your face, that scientifical-
ly determines its clients, particular 
and multifarious needs and solves 
them with more precision than you, 
the owner of the face, can hope to 
achieve. Clinique is about results. 


Ir>s about listening to your prob-
lems and handing you a solution in 
a clean, conveniently sized bottle 
or pot or tube, dearly labeled with 
its purpose. Deep Cleansing Emer-
gency Mask. Stay the Day Lip 
Color. Each of Clinique,s slogans 
is more encouraging than the next.

skin be created?, 


This particular counter, how-
ever, does not answer that question 
with conviction. Ellie Woodward 
observes the discrepancy between 
Clinique's claims toward scientifi-
cally-achieved perfection and the 
everyday bookstore employees who 
dole out advice at Yale's counter. "I 
don,t understand how they know 
stuff about makeup. I didn't even 
try to ask questions. They weren't 
wearing ~nything [Clinique]., 


On 
its 
website, 
preaches extensive training for all 
of its employees. At any Macy's in 
the country, you can find an identi-
cal Clinique counter with . one key 
difference: it will be manned by 
trained technicians, whose chipper 
voices inspire immediate trust. At 
the Yale Bookstore's makeup coun-
ter, however, confusion or mild 
despair 
is the usual reaction elicit-
ed by the eerie vacancy. "There was 
no one there to help me,, a baffled 
sophomore told me. 'cl felt awk-
ward. I tried to hide." 


We are left to wonder: Why 
is the Clinique counter there, and 
why do the "clinicians, look suspi-
ciously like Booktore employees? 
Will they be able to recommend 
the precise product that Clinique's 
scientists have developed for our 
beauty needs? And, at a learning 
institution famed for its professors, 
why isn,t there anyone to teach us 
how to scientifically follow a three 
·step process or apply the right 
lip liner?
