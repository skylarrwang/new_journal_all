with a policeman/' says Hertslet, 
upset. "She was hap.dcuffed." 
Another policeman stationed 
nearby tried to calm the frightened 
girls, but to no avail. "We asked 
the policeman about the new Con-
necticut drinking law and he said 
he wasn't even aware of it. He 
didn't even know what we were 
talking about." 

Nor, evidently, did Jim Bay, 
the Operations Manager of Toad's 
Place. Though revelers at Toad's 
that Saturday night insist that po-
lice swarmed the area, Jim has a dif-
ferent account. 
''I heard some rumor of some 
law change Saturday night, but 
I wasn't informed about it," he 
mumbled distractedly while man-
ning the club's entrance one recent 
Thursday evening. "I never got any 
sort of written notice that things 
had 
changed 
state-wide." 
He 
paused to reflect for a minute, then 
continued. "You know, I actually 
was under the impression that [the 
law] was just a Yale thing; I didn't 
realize it was a state-wide change. 
But hey, I'm kind of busy . right 
now," he said, gesturing at the long 
line outside the door. Clearly, busi-
ness hadn't suffered. 

The full impact of the new law 
on Yale is not yet clear. Precedents 
have not been set and compromises 
have not yet been reached. Several 
Yalies have been made into examples, 
but whether the Administration 
will continue to seek scapegoats re-
mains to be seen. If anything, the 
new law tests the audacity of stu-
dents. Sigma Phi Epsilon recently 
implemented an 
invitation-<:>nly 
policy for its parties. Pierson Col-
lege turned its "Tuesday Night 
Club," once a University-wide par-
ty, into a seniors-only event. Toad's 
Place and College Wine and Liquor 
will continue checking IDs. They 
don't want to risk the consequences 
of letting anything slide, especially 
with policemen watching from . 
the wings. 

The new law's most signifi-
cant effect cannot be measured in 
the number of arrests or the sever-
ity of fines. P.A. 06-112 has most 
drastically changed the perception 
of underage drinking. Though the 
illegal act has always been taboo, 
students once shared party stories 
and announced imminent trips to 
the liquor store without a second 
thought. No one worried about 
concealing the flasks they brought 
to the Halloween concert, and 
"open containers" once referred to 
yesterday's leftovers, not a breach 
of the law. "Rustication" sounded 
more like an obscure reference to 
animal husbandry than a feared 
punishment. 

But the reluctance of both stu-
dents and adults to discuss the pres-
ent state of affairs encapsulates the 
tension and confusion surrounding 
the new law. One thing is certain: 
Students are uneasy. And until the 
challenges it poses to Yalies are 
elucidated, the University's social 
scene will proceed cautiously as it 
seeks to redefine itself in the eyes 
of next year's class of 2011, which 
won't turn 21 until2010.
