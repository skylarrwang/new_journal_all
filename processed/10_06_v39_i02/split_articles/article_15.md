An internet poll robs Louis' Lunch of its crown. 
merica voted. 
And though the official an-
nals of gastronomic history are fa-
mously unsettled on the subject of 
the hamburger's origin, an internet 
poll conducted during August's 
first annual National Hamburger 
Festival in Akron, Ohio claims to 
have divined the historical truth. 
Yes, the long contested history of 
the hamburger's origin is settled. 
The verdict is in. The poll decided 
22 
' 
the outcome of ccThe Hamburger 
Hearings,,, a mock trial at which 
modern day representatives of four 
historical claimants to the invention 
of America,s favorite food present-
ed their cases before a judge and his 
jury, the Burger Commission. 
This actually happened. 
The Elm City's Louis' Lunch 
was one contender at the hearings. 
The famed Crown Street luncheon-
ette, which claims to have sold the 
first hamburger 68 years before 
the birth of the Big Mac, garnered 
only 26% of the vote. Louis' Lunch 
was three percent shy of second 
place, which went to the Menches· 
family of Akron, Ohio. The cy-
ber-verdict ·bestowed entrepreneur 
Charles Nagreen with the coveted 
title, "Father of the Hamburger," 
for a defining moment at the 1885 
World's Fair when he sandwiched 
meatballs between slabs of bread 
for the eating ease of ambulatory 
fairgoers. And so it was that Louis' 
Lunch was relegated from the al-
ready dubious status of very-argu-
ably-the-home-of-the-first-sort-of 
hamburger in the United States 
to 
at-best-the-home-of-the-third-
maybe hamburger in America. 
Louis, Lunch,s affidavit from 
the New Haven Preservation Trust 
can't hold a candle to the fanfare 
that Nagreen's legacy enjoys in his 
native Seymour, Wisconsin, where 
the 
modern-day 
mascot 
Ham-
burger Charlie serves as the city's 
representative on all beef-related is-
sues. Hamburger Charlie's voice is 
appealing. He sounds like Santa,s 
midwestern cousin jolly, well-fed, 
hyper-commercialized. He is a gra-
cious winner. ccLouis' certainly has 
the longest continual selling ham-
burger/' he says conciliatorily dur-
ing a short telephone interview. 
While H-amburger Charlie, on 
the other end of the telephone, is 
just a voice, Ken Lassen barely has 
one in person. "How old do you 
think I am?" he demands in .soft 
gravelly tones. Lassen is the 89-year-
old grandson of Louis Lassen, the 
establishment's eponymous found-
er, who, one fateful day in 1900, 
slapped a patty between two slices 
of toast for a customer on the nin. 
THE NEW jOURNAL 


Today, Lassen's own son, Jeffrey, 
works the counter from 6:00p.m. to 
2:00 a.m. each business day, while 
the elderly Lassen jokes that he is 
u semi-retired." The phrase, meant 
to describe the state of Lassen's ca-
reer, is a metaphor for the state of 
Louis' Lunch itself, a euphemism 
for a dying American way. 
Lassen was flipping patties long 
before the statesmen and business-
men of Seymour, Wisconsin even 
learned of their town's hamburger 
history. 
Raised by his grandpar-
ents, Lassen spent his childhood 
behind the counter, helping put 
meat into the u grinder" a special 
cast-iron grill and sampling it as 
it came out. He began working for 
his family the day after he gradu-
ated from high school. Lassen is 
a tradesman whose goal is the per-
fection that comes -from special-
ization, not the profit that comes 
from commercialization. 
''What 
do I know best? The lunch coun-
ter," says Lassen, who has eaten an 
unfathomable number of hamburg-
ers 
all made at Louis' Lunch. 
The appeal of Louis' creation, 
so starkly in a class of its own, may 
be inaccessible to the uneducated 
masses. 
A burger at Louis' is a 
thick patty, broiled vertically in the 
grinder and served between two 
slices of white toast. The emphasis 
is on the flavor of the meat. ''Every . 
element of the burger is deferential 
to the meat, is there to comple-
ment it," explains Robin Goldstein, 
author of New Haven's scathing 
restaurant guide The Menu. ''The 
bread is really just there to protect 
your fingers from the patty.'' The 
only acceptable fixin's at Louis' are 
tomato, onion, and cheese. Ketch-
up is verboten the restaurant's 
t-shirts portray a ketchup bottle_ 
barred behind the diagonal chord 
struck through an angry red circle. 
Some see Louis' -purism 
as 
classy; others find it needlessly aus-
tere. Either way, it probably hurt 
Louis' at the Hamburger Hear-
ings, where kitsch trumped class. 
August's internet poll awarded 
first and second place to burger-in-
novators who hail from two cities 
that make circuses of their dubious 
burger heritages. Akron is home 
not only to the ~enches broth-
ers but also to the uHamburger 
Festival." America's other burger 
fete, "Home of the Hamburger," 
takes place in Hamburger Charlie's 
Seymour, Wisconsin. In that same 
city, burger lovers can make a pil-
grimage to the Hamburger Hall 
of Fame to admire photographs of 
the world's largest hamburger, an 
8,266 pound whopper prepared in 
Seymour in 2001. "They're profe~­
sionals," Lassen says of the burger 
mavericks who stole spots one and 
two. He shakes his head disdain-
fully. ccThey just aren't about what 
we're about." 
Few businesses are anymore. 
The Lassen's family-run establish:-
ment is on the verge of extinction. 
Because both of Lassen's sons are 
divorced and childless, it's likely 
the next owners won't even be in 
the family. 
Lassen hopes to live 
to see grandchildren, but not for · 
the sake of keeping the business in 
-
the bloodline. "I just want grand-
kids," he says, staring at his diner 
through cataract-damaged eyes. 
He adds, "There's more to life than 
hamburgers.''
