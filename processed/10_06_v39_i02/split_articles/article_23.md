The ghosts of Chapel Street Mall

verlooking the New
Haven Green at 900
Chapel Street · stands
a colossal, modern-
ist building. Its imposing frame of
glass and steel blocks out the rays
of the midday sun as workers from
local office buildings scurry to and
fro under its shaded arcade. In the
lobby stands Brian Keefe. He is a
sales representative for Connecti-
cut Realty Partners, which leases
downtown properties, including the
apartments in this forty thousand
square foot building.

"This is where the most elite
people in New Haven live," Keefe
says, standing in the "Residence
Court," which formerly served
as the interior plaza of the Chapel
Square Mall. This unconventional
atrium features streetlamps and park
benches, bicycle racks and trash
cans, hammocks and gas grills, pic-
nic tables and umbrellas that have
never been subjected to rain.

The lobby feels like a ghost
town, as if all the shoppers had fled
an impending apocalypse. Blank bay
windows stare out at planters that
were once fountains, which divide
the central space into two parallel
paths. Overhead walkways cast dark
shadows. Two colors of vinyl siding
and red brick line the interior walls,
producing a garish, uneven effect. A
plastic Corinthian column supports
a four-sided clock, the baffling cen-
terpiece of this absurd courtyard.

Like the bodies of early New Haven
residents interred under the Green
outside, the old fountains and store-
fronts of the mall are buried under
cheap mulch and synthetic masonry.
A sanitized simulacrum of a bustling
downtown shopping street has been
transformed into a sanitized simu-
lacrum of suburban yard, street,
and park.

But upon entering a former
storefront, one finds not a cheery
suburban living room but a long
hallway leading into a sterile, one-
bedroom unit. It could be found
in any motel--except that some of
the windows look directly into the
barren courtyard, a view that gives
prospective tenants a unique oppor-
tunity to window shop.

This toy suburb is the result
of redevelopment at a site that has
been an embarrassment to down-
town New Haven for decades. The
project started in 1965 as an urban
renewal scheme to revive an eco-
nomically troubled downtown by
encouraging suburban shoppers to
return to the center of the city. But
the mall failed, haunted from the be-
ginning by the assumption that sub-

urban forms would succeed in an
urban context. After countless re-
development schemes based on this
suburbia-on-the-green
paradigm
fell flat, Lubert Adler Real Estate
Funds and their local partner, David
Nyberg, had the novel idea of turn-
ing the Chapel Square Mall inside
out, placing the retail space on the
exterior and redesigning the interior
stores as residential space.

Still, something of the suburban
dream of house and yard lingers in
the heart of the mall-gone-apart-
ment-complex, in its exposed beams
and fountains of mulch, in its second
story porticos and bay windows.

Who constitutes this "New Ha-
ven elite," this landed gentry living
parallel to the public Green? Rents
are upwards of $950 for a one bed-
room unit or $1200 for a two bed-
room. The apartment's website
appeals to tenants' desire to have
it both ways: to have access to a
bustling metropolis while maintain-
ing a comfortable suburban insula-
tion. "Who thought you could ex-
perience the peaceful sanctuary of
a private green space literally feet
from bustling Chapel Street?" the
website asks.

The promoters promise the im-
possible: the protected isolation of a
house and yard, or at least the fac-
simile of one, within the hustle and
bustle of a downtown lifestyle. But
the 24-hour security service, like
those protecting suburban gated
communities, reflects a certain fear
of the lower class residents who live
nearby. Even invited guests must be
led past the guard's desk.

Because of a perceived growth
in the desire for an urban lifestyle
among young professionals and
empty-nesters alike, "downtown
residential"· has become the latest
buzzword in development. Wheth-
er the "Residence Court" will serve
as the new backyard for this market
is dubious. At the end of the tour
he gives prospective tenants, Keefe
insists that available units are sure
to go fast. The half-empty list of 25
doorbells suggests otherwise. Cha-
pel Square still feels like a ghost
town which is strange for a place
that never attracted living souls to
begin with.
