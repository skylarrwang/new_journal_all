EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
But at its core, the publication 
is not a fanzine to Prosek, it's a seri.:-
ous literary magazine about fish. A 
typical issue includes well-crafted 
fishing-themed poems, tutorials, 
and personal essays about fishing, 
such as Brigham Young University 
Professor Michael Rutter's homage 
to the grayling. "I love all things 
grayling," he writes, "but mostly I 
love grayling colors: The splendid 
hues of understated lilac and icy 
green on the spiny sailboat dorsal 
fin; the fluorescent, sapphire-like 
· periods along the body; the dusky 
yellow-green tail; the alluring white 
lips. There's much to admire." 
The Journal is a handsome if 
unassuming publication, neatly de-
signed and expensively bound. Were 
it not for the artwork 
fly fishers in 
sylvan scenes, ancient Byzantine il-
lustrations 
one could be forgiven 
for mistaking it for, say, the Yale 
Literary Magazine. 


Unlike the Yale Literary M aga-
zine, however, it is almost impos-
sible for a Yalie to find a copy. Cur-
rent and back-issues are stored in 
a monstrous, full metal cabinet in 
the third floor of a brick building 
at 305 Crown Street. The office is a 
testament to the journal's removal 
from much of Yale society: schools 
of wooden fish and painted trout 
deck the walls, bumper stickers 
with clever fish puns· are pasted on 
cabinets, and against a wall stands a 
fly-tying table, on which peacock 
feathers and yarn are transformed 
into miniature insects. A painting 
of a girl wearing a scandalous pink 
skirt and black garters, fishing rod 
in hand, greets every visitor. 


But the only fellows this gal 
will ever wink at are her kindred 
• 
fishermen. According to Alter, ''the 
magazine isn't .really geared to Yale 
students. That being said, there are 
students interested 
it's just that 
most of them work on staff." 


The Yale Angler's] ournallooks 
October 2006 
beyond the Yale community for 
most of its funding, submissions, 
and exposure. Each year, when the . 
Journal attends New Jersey's Somer-
set Fly Fishing Conference, among 
the Prosek devotees and intrigued 
fishermen who court their booth 
are many confused by the conjunc-
tion of the words "Yale" and "An-
gler's." "Some people are put off by 
it/' Alter says. One question comes 
up again and again: Why do Yale 
students, who hail from a city not 
known for its trout runs, publish a 
journal about fishing? "It's hard to 
"h 
answer, 
e says. 


Yet here, once again, the mag a-
zine swims upstream to Its source, 
its founder, its hero. At conventions 
such as Somerset, which attract 
young, wealthy fishermen inter-
ested in high-brow fishing culture, 
Prosek's name is often the first loft-
ed from the Elis' lips 
everyone, _ 
whether "fly-fisherman or fly-fish-
erwoman," as the Journal's presi-
dent Tom Gilliland puts it, on some 
level wants to be James Prosek. 


The point of the magazine, then, 
seems to be to promote Prosek's 
brand of fishing, which marries the 
old -school allure of fishing clubs 
with the energy of ambitious un-
dergrads. What Ready Made Maga-
zine is to Better Homes and Gar-
dens, the Yale Angler's Journal is to 
its humdrum, old school standards 
like Field & Stream. The journal 
aims at establishing an intellectual, 
artistic community for fishermen 
away from the stream, regardless 
of whether that stream flows any-
where near Yale. 


If the Journal's mission is to 
create a truly global fishing com-
munity, its annual dinner is a tes-
tament to its progress. Last year's 
tenth anniversary celebration took 
place at the revered New York 
Angler's Club, featured protninent 
speakers from the world of fly-fish-
ing, and auctioned off a fishing trip 
to Argentina for two thousand dol-
lars. The hall was packed to the gills 
with young, rich fishermen, many 
of whom have no connection to the 
University but all of whom paid a 
$120 entrance fee. Yale students mix 
with trout enthusiasts, fly fisher-
men, and anyone for whom fishing 
is more than just a tug on the line. 


Discus_sions of fly-tying technique 
become artistic critique. 


For the Journal, the act of 
spreading one,s arms to measure 
the length of a fish is not simply an 
exercise in angling pride but a uni-
fying gesture, a symbol of both the 
fish and the mind that appreciates 
it. This is a group that sees in gills 
a fundamental, natural beauty. Hu-
mor is. not lost on them, either at 
last yeaes dinner, amid the discus-
sion, the suits, and the speeches, 
someone must have noticed the 
menu: a choice of steak or, predict-
ably, salmon.
