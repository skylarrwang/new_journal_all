AT THE ANNUAL NEW HAVEN MI-
gration Festival, birders gather at 
Lighthouse Point Park to observe 
the yearly arrival of hawks from 
the north. Though the day is damp 
and windy, the park's convention 
hall feels positively festive. The 
building, just yards from the Long 
Island Sound, houses an antique 
carousel, which was built in 1916 
and is now listed on the Connecti-
cut Register of Historic Places. As 
the volunteer bird-rescue organiza-
tion Wind Over Wings prep~res its 
show, a bridal party banished from 
the beach by the rain arrives to have 
portraits taken in front of the car-
ousel. One bridesmaid approaches 
the booth sponsored by the Pea-
body Museum, leans across a row 
of bird skulls, and asks directions 
to the bathroom. 


Near by, at the booth of the 
event's sponsor, New Haven Bird 
Club, a woman examines the mer-
chandise which includes a guide 
for novice hawk aficionados and 
"Flights of Fancy," a line of ~and­
painted Christmas ornaments 
be-
fore declaring, "I have the world's 
most complete wardrobe of bird 
socks!'' and moving on. The next 
table, sponsored by the Connecti-
cut Butterfly Association, is aban-
doned except for a lone caterpillar, 
who steadily climbs a leaf sprouting 
from a film canister. At the win-
dow, several pairs of binoculars are 
trained expectantly on the sky. But 
no hawks appear: the only animals 
visible from the hall are double-
crested cormorants, flocking on 
the stones of the breakwater, and a 
peach-and-white Shih Tzu, trotting 
down the beach behind its owner. 


In · the absence of hawks, side-
shows become main events. Just as 
the raptor display is about to begin, 
the bride arrives with her entourage 
and mounts the carousel. When the 
ride ends, the birders join the wed- · 
ding party in a cheer. The couple 
and its coterie depart in three limos, 
and Wind Over Wings volunteer 
Grace Krick removes a red -shoul-
dered hawk named Forest from his 
cage. The bird, seemingly the only 
hawk inN ew Haven, is followed by 
a peregrine falcon named Isis. After 
Isis, the volunteers introduce Bent-
ley, whom Krick calls "a very brave 
owl." Blind in one eye, the great 
gray bird shares a cage at the aviary 
with Solitaire, a female owl who 
helped nurse him back to health. 


As Krick describes the owl's 52-
inch wingspan, Bentley obligingly 
spreads his wings. "Thank you," 
Krick tells the bird. The show ends 
with the rare gold-en eagle 
"the 
king of all bird 
and the bird of 
kings" dines on rabbit, which the 
staff ordered frozen from a com-
pany named Gourmet Rodent. 


Uphill, deeper into the park, a 
few persistent birders brave the rain, 
still hoping to witness a hawk. Lo-
cated on the Sound, abutting East 
Haven, the park is a "bot~leneck," 
says Gary Lenunon, treasurer of 
the Bird Club, because the hawks 
prefer not to migrate across the 
sea. Thermals 
the pockets of ris-
ing air that allow the birds to gain 
altitude do not form above bodies 
of water, and so the hawks gather 
above the park each aututnn before 
altering their route south. 


Downhill, spirits are high in 
spite of the rain. Yesterday, at the 
Monarch 
Waystation 
a 
flower 
garden that provides milkweeds, 
nectar sources, and shelter for mi-
grating butterflies 
observers spot-
ted Clouded Sulphurs and Red 
Admirals, as well as the common 
Cabbage White. Today the butter-
fliers have already tagged several 
Monarchs, which pass through the 
park on their way to Texas, where 
they will lay eggs before they die. 


As the day goes on, the bird-
ers identify a peregrine falcon and 
an excited butterflier tags a Vice-
roy. The rain stops, but the clouds 
still hang low and gray in the sky, 
and only the most persistent hawk 
devotees remain. Prime hawk spot-
ting days are when the winds are 
from the Northwest after a cold 
front," notes one of the last, linger-
ing birders. Winter will come, and 
so, eventually, will the hawks, but 
today the breeze just blows in from 
the water and the carousel contin-
ues its rounds.
