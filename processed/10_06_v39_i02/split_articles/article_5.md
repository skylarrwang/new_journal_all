SPEAKING To A YALE ANGLER's 
journal board member is a bit like 
speaking to a cult member soon-
er or later, the patriarch enters the 
picture. History begins with a man, 
James Prosek, and continues with 
an epic list of his accomplishments: 
how, at age 21, Prosek wrote and 
published a definitive illustrated 
treatise on trout; how his artistic 
renderings of such fish garnered 
national press and comparisons to 
James Audubon; how he is now 
revered as a triple threat: a man of 
letters, a songsmith, and, as always, 
a pa1nter. 

Since 
graduating 
in 
1997, 
Prosek has published eight books 
and won a Peabody award, all the 
while remaining a figurehead for 
the magazine he helped create as a 
college student. The Angler's Jour-
nal, which Prosek described in the 
first issue as "the closest thing to a 
house for fishy dreams and visions 
we can provide," is blessed by his 
reputation. "His purpose, really, is 
his name,, says Aaron Alter, the 
Journal's current Editor-in-Chief. 

And indeed, everyone the board 
Â· members, the subscribers world-
wide, the wealthy fishermen who 
flock to the annual Yale Angler's 
journal dinner seem to be in awe.
