he teacher is
telling a story about a zorro who
vivia en el bosque con sus amiguitos,
but the restless class keeps calling out
answers without raising their hands.
"!Manos, yo quiero ver las manos!"
she insists, her voice now hoarse
from a long day of teaching. She tells
one boy to pay attention in broken
English and then returns to her les-
sons in Spanish.


Over the next 45 minutes, this
scenario repeats itself the teacher
yells out a question in one language,
students respond in the other, and
the two languages blur together. A
girl with beads and cornrows pumps
her hand in the air "ooh, ooh, yo
know!" In the front, a chubby His-
panic boy begs in ·almost perfect
18
Spanish for the. teacher to call on
him "YO quiero decirle el answer!"


At New Haven's John C. Daniels
School, the dominant language is
Spanglish.


A self-proclaimed "pioneer in
dual-language education," the J.C.
Daniels school is trying to become
a place ''where all children can
learn/ don de todos los niiios pueden
aprender. '' Sixty percent of the 650
students are Hispanic. At the be-
ginning of September, J.C. Daniels
moved into a colossal $44 million
glass structure
a spotless 90,7 40
square foot building complete with
an oversized sunken gym and a
shiny silver "cafetorium." The walls
are plastered with historical displays
declaring "Celebremos la Hispani-
dad" and with the national flags of
Peru, Cuba, Panama, Mexico and
Puerto Rico.


"We are not a bilingual school,"
insists Robin Barna, Head Instruc-
tional Coach at J. C. Daniels for the
past fifteen years. She explains that
at bilingual schools, after thirty
months, students are sent off. This
school is, she attests, "completely
dual
language
here, · everybody
learns both." After basic training
in their native tongue during kin-
dergarten and first grade, all chil-
dren, regardless of their language
background, are plunged into a mix
of homework and tarea, arithmetic
and matemdticas, classrooms and
salones, teachers and maestros. From
second to sixth grade, on alternate
weeks, each subject is taught in ei-
ther English or Spanish. As a result,
classes move straight from atoms to
moleculas without pausing for
review. Each classroom contains a mix
of English-dominant, Spanish-dom-
inant, and completely bilingual stu-
dents. "They help each other learn,"
Barna says.


"The kids love it," says Prin-
cipal Gina Wells. "Mostly it's the
parents who pull their kids out."
She estimates that eighty percent of
the parents love the program and
the other twenty percent complain.
