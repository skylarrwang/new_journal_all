EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
For a brief moment each August, Daria Vander Veer is the most powerful person at Yale University. Armed with only a yellow pencil and a spiral notebook, the tall strawberry-blonde single-handedly begins to draw up the futures of Yale students. Unlike Shelly Kagan, she does not have the power to extinguish their intellectual pretensions, and she can't smother their dreams of neurosurgeonhood like the professors of MCDB 120. But she can, and does, send some of them halfway up Science Hill at 9:30 every morning for a French seminar.

ccI've often jokingly thought that I would give President Levin a call, and say to him, 'I just want to be sure you realize that, for the first two weeks of classes, I'm the most important administrator at Yale, not you, sir."' Vander Veer adds, with a note of irony, "I'm certainly the most popular."

As the local czarina of classrooms, she is not exaggerating. It's her job to assign classrooms to classes, a seemingly minor decision that has a huge impact on the popularity of courses and the happiness of students not to mention the egos of professors. Harold Bloom refuses to teach in any room other than a sunlit second floor seminar room number 208-in the centrally located William L. Harkness Hall.

The czarina's semester-altering decisions elicit more raw anger than most of her peers would ever dream of.

At Harvard, Vander Veer's counterpart oversees only a fraction of the University's classrooms; he claims that he cannot imagine doing his job without hiring an assistant for the first month of each semester. Here at Yale, however, with the exception of a few dozen rooms that are directly administered by departments, Vander Veer has toiled alone under the title of Associate Registrar since January of 2005 to place every course offered by the College and the Graduate School for Arts and Sciences into its semester-long home.

Her methodology is a mix of the archaic and the haphazard. After departments complete their proposals and select their course times in June, the registrar's office spends more than a month proofreading course descriptions, removing overlaps, and ensuring that professors are not slotted for two classes simultaneously.

In August, Vander Veer takes the data and assigns the rooms for several hundred courses by hand. Her criteria are so numerous, she says, that scheduling software-which does exist-could not possibly take them all into account. She considers past enrollment, potential popularity, peculiar needs ("can you get me a room where students can paint on the tables?"), proximity to department offices and, last but not least, convenience for students (as an undergrad who graduated in 1987, she should know). While she keeps tabs on all these requirements, Vander Veer must reshuffle course locations to match shopping period's shifting enrollment numbers.

The results are displeasing for many and chaotic for most. Those who dream of a modern seminar room in Linsley-Chittenden may find themselves exiled to the dank bowels of Becton Labs. At the beginning of shopping period, instructors complain en masse that their classrooms are woefully undersized, dimly lit, wholly inconvenient, a travesty of modern architectural design. They clamor to be moved. Mark Ennis, the Anthropology Department administrator who relays the qualms of his professors to Vander Veer, acts as a peacekeeper. "A lot of panic sets in with the professors," he says.

Yale professors are not the sort to be undone by a disagreeable room assignment, and some are not particularly patient. Professor Steven Brill, whose journalism course this semester is at 10:30 a.m., complained about his small seminar room. "Apparently there's some rule at Yale that you can't teach seminars from 10:30 to 12:30 in the morning," he says. Negotiating the switch with Vander Veer "wasn't pleasant," he recalled. "She was incredibly supercilious and rude to the person who works in my office."

More sympathetic are the department registrars who have developed relationships with Vander Veer which they admit can't hurt their chances of getting the desired room swaps. "She does everything she can to make us happy within her power," says Patricia Slatter, the Assistant to the Philosophy Department chair. "It's not an ideal situation." Registrar of the English Department Ruben Roman sympathizes: "She must have a very thick skin."

Vander Veer articulates the problem succinctly. "When you go to a hotel," she says, "and they give you a room, and you don't like your room, you can go back downstairs and say 'I don't like this room, give me another one.' And they give you another one. And I think sometimes they think I can do that. I wish I could, but they're sort of astounded when I say 'I actually don't have any rooms that are bigger than the one you have that are available.'"

Vander Veer faults a long-standing tradition which allows professors to choose teaching times. When they all cluster around a few desirable slots, Vander Veer can only scramble to clean up the mess. It is no coincidence that the professors teaching on Tuesdays at 1:30, a time slot packed with seminars, are often those who complain about substandard seminar rooms. Vander Veer is, to paraphrase Vander Veer, simply the desk attendant at the world's least accommodating hotel.

Yet half a decade into the 21st century, Yale wants to have it all: a shopping period without pre-registration, professors free to choose whatever course times they want, and a single assistant registrar who assigns rooms to every course with a pencil and a notebook.

Vander Veer is hard pressed to explain the system. "It seems almost medieval that it's done this way," admits the desk clerk, the dictator, the unseen spirit guide who sends students trekking up Science Hill for French seminars. "Heaven forbid I came down with chicken pox in the first week of classes," she says.

How would anyone know where to go?
