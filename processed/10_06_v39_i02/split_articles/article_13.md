little use for dual language education 
when Spanish will only be practiced 
at school, and the occasional Latino 
family will prefer to abandon Ia 
lengua de patria altogether, sending 
their children to a more convention-
al school. 


Despite 
its 
detractors, 
J.C. 
Daniels shows no signs of slowing 
down. Before the recent move, two 
small separate buildings 
housed 
its classrooms. Students would run 
across the street from _ class to class, 
teachers felt cramped, and a 23-year 
battle for a new location began. 
Now, the spotless month-old facil-
ity dominates Congress Avenue, 
and every aspect of the school ex-
udes an aura of efficiency. With the 
help of a specialist from Califor-
nia, teachers are now implementing 
the regimented "SlOP" (Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol) 
program of instruction, which · cov-
ers lesson techniques for everything 
from vocabulary building to reading 
comprehension. 
Students show improved - per-
formance on standardized tests in 
all subjects, and although it is still 
a neighborhood public school, its 
growth is evidenced by the ten bus-
es and seven vans it employs daily. 
Administrators may be forced to 
turn applicants away next year, as 
October 2006 
the school aspires to become a more 
competitive magnet school with en-
trance exams that admit only New 
Haven's brightest students. 
The dual language program is · 
far from perfect. '' Si, es dificil," a 
substitute teacher sighs when asked 
about the challenge of bilingual in-
struction. During math class, she 
often finds herself begging English-
speaking students to stop complain-
ing that they don't understand-
double-digit addition is the same in 
every language. While distributing 
worksheets, she must constantly re-
explain the instructions in English 
for students who didn't understand 
the Spanish the first time. 
It's most difficult for the non-
Hispanic students, who tend to be 
less comfortable with Spanish than 
the Latino students are with English. 
Outnumbered by Spanish-speak-
ing and bilingual Hispanic students, 
Barna concedes that these English-
dominant students "are not learning 
Spanish as quickly as we'd like them 
to." The school has mastered Eng-
lish as a Second Language instruc-
tion, but is still looking for a Spanish 
as a Second Language teacher. 
Such an inconsistency is the re-
sult of New Haven's staggeringly 
fast demographic shift. In the 1 970s, 
Latinos made up less than four per-
cent of New Haven's population. 
Today, they comprise nearly one 
third of its citizens, and the city is 
still learning how it can best serve its 
new residents. 
Although the school hosts chil-
dren from all of New Haven, most 
live in the Hill neighborhood near 
the school. Compared with New 
Haven as a whole, which the last 
census listed as 21% Hispanic and 
37% African-American, this neigh-
borhood holds a disproportionately 
high Latino concentration 
4 6% are 
Hispanic, a minority group which 
surpasses the black residents who 
make up 39o/o. Here, homes where 
Spanish is the main language ( 41%) 
are almost as prevalent as those that 
are English-dominant (54%). Of 
these Latinos, half still speak im-
perfect English. As more enroll at 
J.C. Daniels, students from a bilin-
gual home environment persistently 
outshine those raised in a single-lan-
guage home. 
Though the curriculum of this 
elementary school is distinctive, its 
students are like students every-
where: they sit together, eat to-
gether, pass notes to each other in 
class. Over the past eight years, J.C. 
Daniels has offered the challenge of 
stepping into bilingual shoes five 
days a week providing children a 
comfortable learning environment 
where they can get to know their 
neighbors without losing or hiding 
their culture. 
"They're raised together. Ies 
like they're brothers and sisters. It's 
definitely different." At J. C. Daniels, 
the kids of New Haven are learn-
ing to celebrar Ia hispaninad within 
their neighborhoods and within 
their homes. They are learning, one 
classroom at a time, to become one 
comunidad with two idiomas.
