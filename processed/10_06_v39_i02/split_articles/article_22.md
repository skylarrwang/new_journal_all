controllably reading the world as if
it were a text and projecting it upon-
us: in this case, through fashion.
The flip-flop is a Y in the alphabet
of the world, a literal text marking
the pavement.
ix decades after Marshman used
footwear to delineate Yale's so-
cial strata, the rules that govern
Yale fashion · are . decidedly more
liberal. Going to cla_ss is no longer
a coat and tie affair: few occasions-
are. And while fashion today is still
hierarchical, flip-flops function as
the great equalizer. Unpracticed at
dressing up, Yalies wear flip-flops
to dress down.

Flip-flops are a site of class
consciousness. For Yale students,
an expens1ve pa1r 1s not supenor to
its less pricey counterpart. In fact
at $14, Havaianas are a cheap fash-
ion fix. Those who own expensive
Rainbows also own flip-flops from
Wal-Mart and Old Navy. Fashioni-
stas who own Siegerson Morrison
kitten heel flip-flops
whose debut
guru Meghan Clearly says marked
the «height of the flip-flop madness
of the 'fashion' scene"
treat them
no better than a pair from Target.
These flip-flops are simply flip-
flops: emblems of practicality, ease,
and comfort. They are the essence
of footwear, the barest essentials of
support, protection, and city sur-
vival. At Yale, flip-flops symbolize
the liberalization of the Eli caste
system Marshman parodied. They
simultaneously manage to be chic
and to oppose the bourgeois ele-
ments of fashion.
In that sense, they are an objec~
of rebellion. Northwestern Uni-
versity's championship women's
lacrosse team became daughters
of the revolution on July 19, 2005
when some members of the clan
arrived for a meet-and-greet with
President Bush at the White House
October 2006
And while ashion
wearing flip-flops. The flop faux pas
was front-page news, riling cultural
critics to encapsulate~ the incident
as emblematic of the degeneration
of fashion responsibility. The jux-
taposition of Bush's conservatism
and the naked toes of the female
athletes was a public expression of
the everyday rebellion played out
at Yale, where flip-flops flop where
W once treaded the courtyards in
loafers.

Those who decry the shoe as
socially unacceptable also argue
against its practicality. "They are
bad for your feet," says Cleary.
«The way you see them worn ... is
really bad. That's the big deception
of the flip-flop." Schlepping around
in flip-flops leaves dust, road resi-
due, and the day's dregs trapped in
· foot cradles. Wearers walk home
with blackened feet and, sometimes,
sore ankles. For their winter fans,
there's road salt and frostbite. Po-
diatrists have rallied against them.
That the flip...:flop ·is simultane-
ously unacceptable in formal soci-
ety and pervasive in the collegiate
environment that will · ostensibly
·feed into that strata positions them
in the wardrobes of becoming. We
don't wear flip-flops to job inter-
views, which will determine our fu-
ture, but to class, as if it won't. To
make such a distinction is to admit
that this place is only a temporary
side trip, a diversion where it's cool
to look good but uncool to care that
you do.

Marshman wrote that shoes are
a "real index" of men. Following
his lead, we should take a moment
to ponder why we wear the shoes
we do. Trends in footwear are not
incidental but discursive of the peo-
ple we are. Like what we call them,
they represent a shift, a becoming,
a transition that occurs somewhere
between a flip and a flop.
