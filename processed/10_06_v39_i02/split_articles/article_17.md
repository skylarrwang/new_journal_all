n October 13th, a thin 
green pamphlet offering 
"Information for the Yale 
Community regarding 
Connect-
icu.t's cAct Concerning Underage 
Drinking; P.A. 06-112"' surfaced 
in residential college dining halls. 
Appearing twelve days after · the 
new law came into effect, the pam-
phlet was an overdue attempt by 
Yale to clarify the state's new alco-
hol laws. Since late August, rumors 
and speculation have kept students 
wondering how the new law would 
affect social life at Yale. So far, it 
is altering what it means to attend 
this historically looser-laced mem-
ber of the Ivy League. 
October 2006 

Only a month ago, three gig-
gling Yale women enjoyed a care-
free evening out on the town. They· 
were dressed alike 
each wore her 
own version of the skinny jeans, 
beaded top, and stiletto heels night-
life uniform and all three left their 
dorm holding an alcoholic beverage 
of choice. Two splashed beer out 
of cans as they skipped down Cha-
pel Street, while the other sipped 
discretely out of a red Solo cup. A · 
balding policeman stationed at the 
corner of High and Chapel Streets 
nodded at the girls as they passed, 
then glanced at his watch. Although 
the girls were clearly not 21, he did 
not stop them. He leaned wearily 
against the street sign and watched 
them enter the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon fraternity house. Another night, 
another party. 

On the night of September 30th, 
the evening that the law went into 
effect, the scene was markedly dif-
ferent. Police patrolled the streets 
surrounding Yale with a new vigor. 
They endured tense negotiations 
with residential college deans, ar-
rested undergraduates using fake 
IDs, and handled the fallout of a 
recent sting operation that cracked 
down on New Haven liquor stores. 
As one cop dragged a handcuffed 
undergraduate out of Toad's Place, 
he shouted, ccDoes t4is mean any-
thing to you? Do you understand 
what's happening here?" 

Fifteen years from now, it may 
be clear what is happening here-
what effects the law has had on the 
University's atmosphere. At the 
present, it's uncertain whether Yale 
will be able to maintain its fun-lov-
ing reputation. In a 2004 editorial, 
the staff of The Harvard Crimson 
enviously pointed to ccNew Ra-
ven's relaxed drinking laws," and 
"Yale's benevolent policies towards 
underage alcohol consumption." 

Connecticut's new law raises the 
question of who is responsible for 
creating the campus atmosphere 
that will best keep students happy, 
healthy, and safe 
the University 
Administration or a group ·of state 
legislators. For all of the animus 
Elis bear against Harv:ard and its 
strict tailgating ·policies, the Can-
tabs' rules are the product of the 
Boston Police Department, not 
Harvard President Derek Bok. 

Should theN ew Haven police crack 
down, there is little indication that 
Woodbridge Hall will put up more 
of a fight than its Cambridge coun-
terpart. If it does not, what social 
attractions will Yale offer the Class 
of 2011? Will the next generation of 
stiletto-clad trios and SAE revelers 
take this into account when they 
decide whether to come to Yale? 

No current student can answer 
that question. Nor can the many 
New Haven liquor stores, dance 
clubs, or bars that watched with 
bewilderment as years of "letting it 
slide" and cclooking the other way" 
came to a screeching halt on Oc-
tober tst. Even those vendors that 
knew about the revised law were 
unsure how much it would change. 

When a law affects a state's entire 
underage population, one would 
expect a more visible attempt to in-
form the public. Before the belated 
pamphlets, 
however, 
education 
came in the form of a crackdown, 
and no one is sure when a new sta-
tus quo will emerge. 

n June 2nd, when Connecticut 
Governor M. Jodi Rell signed 
the act into law, most Yale under-
graduates were far from campus. 
Driven by the efforts of the Gov-
ernor's Prevention Partnership 
a 
coalition between the Connecti-
cut state government and business 
leaders to "keep Connecticut's 
youth ~afe, successful and drug-
free'' 
the law sealed loopholes

ccYou can now be held respon..: 
sible if you don't take reasonable 
efforts to prevent minors from con-
suming alcohol at your party," says 
Lieutenant Michael Patten of the 
. 
Yale Police. His definition of "rea-
sonable efforts" 
''telling people 
to leave if they're drinking you 
can stay but the alcohol can't" is, 
at best, hazy. "It's all new stuff so 
things are going to be fleshed out 
as they go along," he admits. The 
process of ''fleshing things out" has 
been confusing for authority fig-
fresh case of wine. "However, the 
week before the new law took effect 
there was a police sting operation. 
The store was caught selling alco-
hol to minors, along with fourteen 
stores in neighboring towns. Col-
lege Wine had to pay a $750.00 fine 
and close for three days. 

Sting operations, in which offi-
c.ers let a suspect's unlawful actions 
progress in order to gather evidence 
of wrongdoing before a police 
raid, are not a new phenomenon 
in New Haven, and College Wine 
and Liquor has endured its share in 
years past. Still, the assistant man-
ager insists that the police have been 
"harsher" in recent weeks, and that 
the sting operation happened un-
usually early in the school year. 

"This was the first time we've actu-
ally gotten into trouble," he says. 
"It's different." 

Spiro Pi at, the owner of Broad-
way Liquor, is less nervous. The 
store, located less prominently than 
College Wine on the outskirts of 
Yale's campus, .is not even on the 
radar of most freshmen. Broadway 
Liquor attracts travel-fatigued busi-
nessmen from the nearby Marriott, 
workers from stores on Whalley 
Avenue around the corne~ and a 
consistent clientele who are, ac-

cording to its owner, cc just around." 
It's evident that his store caters to-a 
more adult crowd: a collage of near-
ly nude ladies adorns the counter-
top, as do two scrawled signs that 
note: "21 +over no ID!!! No liquor ... 
no exceptions. 21 + over!!" Though 
his shelves are stocked with aged 
tequila and Puerto Rican rum, one 
thing is conspicuously absent from 
Broadway . Liquor: the effects of 
the new underage drinking law. As 
of mid-October, Piat was unaware 
that there had been a change. It goes 
to show, perhaps, how Yale-centric 
the crackdown has been. Around 
the corner from Payne Whitney 
Gym but past the main Broadway 
thoroughfare, the store is just far 
enough to remain untouched by the 
intensified enforcement. 

Fraternity Row does not enjoy 
the same lack of scrutiny. Students 
who live and party in houses on 
High Street and Lynwood Place 
are well-versed in the intricacies 
of the alcohol law. Although most 
frats are formally recognized by the 
University, their off-campus loca-
tions place them under the jurisdic-
tion of the New Haven police. As 
a fulcrum of Yale's underage social 
life, the frats have had to make some 
serious adjustments. 

In addition to tracking down 
kegs and cranberry juice, Solo cups 
and playlists, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
Ion president David Kemp and his 
brothers now have other details 
to attend to: complying with the 
new law and worrying about the 
increased police · presence in and 
around Yale. Though Kemp claims 
that the law has sparked only a "re-
iteration of our policies of the past," 
party-hopping Yalies lament what 
they perceive to be a sea-change in 
the partying environment. Most no-
ticeable is the diminished frequency · 
of "SAE Late Night," a weekly par-
ty ritual that has, for many students, 
defined Thursday nights at Yale. 

Kemp, however, insists that 
his fraternity is simply being more 
careful. "We've reinforced our risk 
management policy," he explains. 
Frat brothers now check IDs at the 
door and mark the hands of under-
age students, who won't be served 
alcohol. "We also provide alternate 
beverages, food if someone needs it, 
and we don't serve visibly intoxi-
cated people," Kemp says. "The 
New Haven police want more sub-
dued affairs. They're serious about 
enforcing the law, so we have to lis-
ten to them." 

Despite the void in many stu-
dents' Thursday night social sched-
ules, Kemp is not worried that qual-
ity of life will worsen in the long 
run. "In the end, ! ~think the Yale 
experience is still going to be pretty 
similar," he says. But at this point, it 
is hard to tell. 

Lieutenant Patten also down-
plays the impact of the change. He 
claims that his department has al-
ways been strict, " ... issu[ing] in-
fractions for public drinking in the 
past on a fairly regular basis." He 
adds, "this new law doesn't make 
any differentiation." But judging 
from students' anecdotes, the rate 
at which IDs have been confiscated 
and parties have beeu broken up in-
dicates other wise. 

n an e-mail with the subject 
line ccN o More Mr. Nice Guy," 
Ezra Stiles College Master Stuart 
Schwartz explained that, in light 
of "the amount of partying in the 
college 
last 
weekend 
unregis-
tered 
and the apparent violations 
of the college and state laws and 
regulations I am forced to bring 
the period of <transition' to a close." 
After advising Stilesians to regis-
ter parties with more than fifteen 
guests, Master Schwartz added an 
ominous warning: "Those who reg-
ister their events will have the privi-
lege of a warning from the master or 
dean prior to any call to the police. 
Those who do not register will not 
be so warned." His closing remark-
ccHave fun, use your heads" 
is em-
blematic of the mixed message the 
University is sending to students. 
The restrictions are ambiguous, but
