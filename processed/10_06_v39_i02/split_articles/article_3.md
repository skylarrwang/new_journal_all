IN THE BASEMENT BENEATH CoM~ 
mons dining hall, between the main 
kitchen and the administrative of-
fices, there is a room marked with a 
plaque. The room is a walk-in cool-
er, and its plaque is a laminated color 
print-out that reads, in red letters, 
"Jasper's Box." Jasper himself is long 
gone he retired-to North Carolina 
in 2001 
but the sign remains. 

Jasper was in charge of main-
taining stored produce, and, since he 
first began working forty years ago; 
the cooler he stocked was known as 
"Jasper's Box.-" The sign came lat-
er, although no one is sure exactly 
when, just as no one is really sure 
who exactly Jasper was. The only

reminder of his years at Yale is the 
spacious cooler and everyone tries 
to fill it with their own stories. 

"He had perfect attendance, all 
forty years,, recalls Dan Flynn, the 
manager of Commons who worked 
with Jasper. Flynn's office is across 
the hall from Jasper's Box. ccWe'd 
have Christmas vacation for two or 
three weeks. We'd say <Jasper, where 
you going?' He'd say, ci don't know.' 
He'd just get one of those bus passes 
d

, an go. 

Another 
Commons 
worker 
chimes in. «He went to New York 
every weekend. He never stayed 
home. I would see him walking to 
the train station and ask him if he 
wanted a ride, but he never took 
one." 'She pauses. cci don't think he 
ever drove. I don't think he ever 
even owned a car." 

"I heatd, he got in a car accident 
when he : was seventeen," Flynn 
recalls. ccN ever drove again." J as-
per lived in the Taft Apartments, 
and could walk to work or to the 
train station. 

The refrigerator he left behind 
consists of two matching concrete 
rooms, blocked at each end by a stiff 
rubber curtain. · The thermometer 
reads 42 degrees, but it's not cold 
enough to be uncomfortable. The 
room originally stored only fruits 
and vegetables, but . as Commons 
grew, Jasper's job expanded with the 
cooler's contents. The front room 
holds mostly dairy products, but 
also assorted perishables: pickled 
eggplant, fig compote, a half gallon 
bucket of tomato basil sauce.' An 
entire corner is devoted to cheese, 
stacked in cardboard boxes under-
neath a ventilation grate. Every-
thing is stacked on plastic palettes, 
in piles as tall as a grown man. No 
single stack is light enough to lift by 
hand. It would take at least twenty 
trips to carry everything out of 
"Jaspers Box."

CCHe was a hard worker," says 
Joe Veronesi, the head chef. 

Jean Ward the Commons em-. 
ployee who Veronesi says knew Jas-
per best 
is a black woman, freck-
led, with red hair. When asked about 
Jasper and cars, she says, ccThat was 
his thing." But is it true about the 
accident? She shrugs. 

A lot has changed over the last 
decade: The inner room of Jasper's 
Box is now the beverage room. 
Most of the space is occupied by a 
locked cage that belongs to Yale Ca-
tering. On the shelves, there are the· 
standard crates of alcohol, but also 
more exotic fare 
Tsing Tao, Kal-
iber, and Wolaver's Organic Beer. 
Loose cans have been swept un-
stacked into milk crates. The cage is 
new since Jasper left, although the 
name has not changed. 

No one calls it anything other 
than Jasper's Box. The workers who 
stock the cooler do not know any 
more than Jasper's name and that he 
is gone more or less what students 
in residential colleges know about 
John Branford or Ezra Stiles. It is 
all they care to know. 

Veronesi insists, «He's well-
missed."
