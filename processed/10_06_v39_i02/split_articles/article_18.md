the enforcement is harsh, and the 
school cares less about students' 
drinking habits than about keeping 
their criminal records clean. 

In years past, the rules that 
undergraduates actually obeyed 
were largely unspoken: Try to keep 
parties contained; turn the music 
down as the clock creeps closer to 
dawn; clean up; don't break other 
laws. However, with the exception 
of a few fastidious students, parties 
tended to stay unregistered 
and 
hosts tended to slip by unscathed. 
As long as students were safe and 
healthy, the Masters seemed satis-
fied, and their liability under the 
old laws was limited. 

The new law, however, affects 
not only students, but their Mas-
ters who· are now at personal risk. 
"Our Master has taken the provi-
sion of the law that states that 'the 
person in charge of the domain will 
bear . responsibility' to mean that 
that person is him," says a Yale ju-
. 
nior, who requested anonymity. Still, 
when he and his suitemates threw a 
party this year, the recent vigilance 
scarcely crossed their minds. Ten 
minutes before guests were slated 
to arrive, they received · a personal 
phone call from the Master remind-
ing them of the new law. 

"[Our Master] said, 'Don't let 
people go outside with cups, just 
keep people inside of the entrance-
way."' They responded by ·put-
ting up signs that read, 'No booze 
outside. Thanks' and 'Please throw 
your cups out before leaving.' There 
were no problems. "Though we 
were initially kind of worried about 
the police showing up, we kind of 
forgot about it as soon as the party 
started," they explained. 

The boys are already plan-
ning another party. "This law 
won't change my social life," one 
of them said. "Our next party is 
soon ... Stop by.'' _ -

His attitude reflects many stu-
dents' determination to not let com-
plex legalities affect their routines. 
This goes for Yale policies as well, 
which have resurfaced with renewed 
' 
purpose in response to the law. A 
University procedure called "rus-
tication" 
a word that means little 
to most students 
has always been 
included in the Yale College man-
ual of UndergradU:ate Regulations. 

Rustication is, as the manual out-
lines, a response io "violation of the 
dormitory regulations ... requir[ing] 
the student in question to live off 
- campus, either for a specified pe-
riod or permanently. This penalty is 
called 'rustication.' Rusticated stu-
dents may be denied access to the 
college itself and to its facilities." 

It is not a . term that regularly 
surfaces in conversations over a 
keg. "What the hell is rustication?" 
asks a senior, who has never heard · 
the term, and does not know that it 
could threaten her. 

o one suite of sophomore boys, 
. this highfalutin word has ac-
quired new relevance. In discuss-
ing their plight, the boys are chatty 
and affable; they crack half-hearted 
jokes about the seriousness of their 
predicament and accuse one anoth-
er of being the most "moronic" of 
the group. Yet the gravity of their 
situation is clear: They insist on re-
maining anonymous in this article 
because they are in serious trou-
ble, and the threat of "rustication" 
looms too close for comfort. 

The weekend of October 1sT 
seemed like a fine time to host a 
. party. The weather was crisp but 
not chilly, midterm hysteria had 
not yet descended, and the boys 
were eager to continue a tradition of 
hosting consistently successful par-
ties. As always, the boys purchased 
gallons of low-quality alcohol, set 
a time, spread the word, and never

THE NEW jOURNAL 
' .· 


October 2006 
thought twice about registering. 
They also didn't think twice 
about the date their party was to · 
be held: the very night when the 
new alcohol law would come into 
effect. They admit it was a poor 
decision, but partially blame it on 
the lack of information. One suite 
member thought the alcohol law 
was changing on October 4th. An-
other reasoned, ''We weren't al-
lowed to drink [alcohol] anyway, 
so I didn't think the law change 
mattered. It was already an 'illegal' 
party in its totality." 

But their college Master, they 
claim indignantly, did little to elu-
cidate the new policies. At a college-
. wide meeting early in the semes-
ter, discussion of the new law was 
" .. .like a joke,'' according to one of 
the boys. "Everyone was laughing 
because basically 75o/o of the col-
lege is underage anyway. It was 
like, 'Oh, we can still drink in our 
rooms."' He chuckles sardonically. 
"It didn't really seem like anything 
was going to change." 

On the night of the party, it be-
came painfully evident that things 
had changed. Approximately one 
hundred and fifty people showed 
up, a number so large that the party 
spilled into the courtyard. Nearly 
everyone carried a red cup, laugh-
ing, yelling, flirting, drinking. 

By 11:00 p.m., four New Ha-
ven not Yale 
police officers had 
entered the college courtyard and 
were observing the scene, checking 
their watches. The hosts at last re-
membered the significance of that 
particular night, panicked momen-
tarily, then got on with the party. 
"If anything, the pace of the party 
sped up once the cops arrived," 
one host recalls wistfully. "It was 
like when the police stand outside 
of a fraternity house 
no one cares, 
no one stops." 

Obviously intoxicated but still 
lucid enough to remember the sig-
nificance of October 1 sr, one guest 
started a raucous countdown to 
midnight. Guests spilled beer on 
their shirts as they drank as quickly 
as possible, desperate to beat the 
deadline. It was a decidedly less sa-
vory Cinderella story, with guests 
evading the New Haven police rath-
er than Prince Charming. 

The 
college Dean material-
ized shortly, and began negotiating 
with the irate officers. By 11:45, the 
Dean was ordering students to toss 
cups, gather belongings, and get out. 
. By midnight it was all over for ev-
eryone, that is, except the hosts. 

The next morning, the boys 
awoke to two unpleasant reminders 
of the previous night: hangovers, and 
an email from the Dean and Master 
of their college calling for an imme-
diate conference. The boys were told 
that if they held another party, they 
would either be rusticated, or sent 
to the Executive Committee, who 
would review their status as Yale stu-
dents. One host describes the meet-
ing as "one of the worst experiences 
of my life." Harsh consequences for 
"just another party.'' 

A week later, the fallout had 
partially settled. "We are being 
made an example," one of the 
boys grumbles. "I think people are 
scared about what's going to hap-
pen. No parties have been thrown 
since the law has happened ... No 
one wants to be the scapegoat.'' 

Though they were spared rus-
tication, the change in the law has, 
they say, slammed the door on ''a 
way of life.'' 

or freshmen struggling to nego-
tiate a new social scene, being 
thrust into a shifting climate . has 
been doubly awkward. Freshman 
Counselors, like Jus tin Ash of Ezra 
Stiles College, have had to rise to 
the challenge of helping first-years

et some traditions have already 
stopped. Blissful ignorance ends 
at the kelly green doors to Toad's 
Place, the host of the 21 and over 
Saturday night dance parties that 
have long characterized Yale night-
life. The saying goes "All roads 
lead to Toad's," and every Saturday 
flocks of inebriated Yalies gravitate 
towards the club like moths to a 
flarne. It was once infamously easy 
to enter: Most undergraduates be-
30 
-
lieved that any fake ID that vaguely 
resembled its bearer would pass. 

But in the past few years, Toad's 
has been raided more frequently 
and underage admits have been 
ejected and even fined by the local 
police. Rumors of raids reached a 
frenzy in the days leading up to the 
alcohol law's implementation. Un-
der the reign of P.A. 06-112, all IDs 
are scrutinized. Bouncers often re-
quest multiple forms to ensure that 
names and birthdates match. In 
the line, whispers circulate debat-
ing the harshness of that evening's 
bouncer. Has he taken any IDs? 
Is he asking for multiples? Many 
desert the line and head next door 
to Yorkside Pizza. For those who 
get in, it is hard to miss the sign an-
nouncing: "Toad's place reserves the 
right to physically remove hostile 
persons from the premises." 

Fifty feet from that sign on an 
October night, Junior Angel Hert-
slet, along with her friend Denise, 
shivered together on the sidewalk 
bordering Toad's Place, with no 
intention of entering. The girls 
were waiting for a friend who was 
busy grinding and bopping on the 
dance floor inside. Amidst a parade 
of passing characters, from rowdy 
members of the men's lacrosse team 
to fatigued truck drivers, the girls 
chatted quietly, trying to pass the 
time. Their conversation was sud-
denly interrupted, however, when a 
Toad's bouncer approached. 

"He came up to [Denise] and I 
and said, 'Leave this street right now, 
just leave,"' Hertslet recalls. At 5'6", 
with honey-blonde hair, kind eyes, 
and soft features, Hertslet's pres-
ence is hardly threatening. So why 
was he yelling at her? Surprised by 
the seriousness of his voice, the girls 
left quickly and headed back toward 
their dorm. However, the guilt of 
abandoning their friend was strong: 
Leave no girl behind, even if it's on 
the dance floor at Toad's. 

In the twenty minutes they'd 
been gone, however, the situation 
at the nightclub had taken a turn for 
the worse. "When we came back, 
our friend was coming out of Toad's 
"
