The trailer opens with a shot 
of Austin Purnell, a Wesleyan ju-
nior,_plucking items from a Harvard 
dumpster with exaggerated panache. 
While he dances with an empty wa-
ter cooler, classical music crashes in 
the background 
"there was actu-
ally an orchestra playing near the 
dumpsters/' Jean interjects 
and 
hits a crescendo, dramatizing the 
silly scene. Expository text flashes 
across the screen, transitioning to an 
excerpt from an interview with Rob 
Gogan, head of Harvard Recycling . 
"There's no formal policy against 
divers," he says, "but we don't like 
it." Images of teeming dumpsters 
are juxtaposed with a shot of a near-
empty "donation station," driving 
the point of the_ film home: Th~re is . 
an extraordinary amount of waste, 
and colleges aren't handling it well. 
Before applying to Wesleyan for 
funds, Jean and Brenda researched 
recycling programs at various uni-
versities in the Northeast. "As plans 
for the movie progressed, we real-
ized it could become a propaganda 
vehicle to develop colleges' recy-
cling programs," says Jean. ''I didn't 
know anything about this stuff be-
fore we put together the project." 
As a paradigm, the proposal 
cites Bates University, whose waste 
management program was orches-
trated by a non-profit consult-
ing firm called Dump and Run. At 
Bates, students' recyclables are col-
lected, stored, and sold in a massive 
.. 
tag sale in the fall; in 2005, the effort 
converted the goods into approxj-
mately $12,000 of profit, which the 
school donated to community or-
ganizations. ''Wesleyan is on a pro-
gram called 'freecycle,"' says Jean. 
''There's no real infrastructure just 
these big storage pods." 
"The pods are disgusting," adds 
Quinn. "Mildewing, decomposing." 


While Wesleyan's recycling 
program lacks a sturdy infrastruc-
ture, its dumpster diving commu-
nity has been a fixture for years. 
The campus' subculture is rooted 
in the school's Earth and Well-Be-
ing Houses, residential collectives · 
for like-minded students. Bren-
dan is the current manager of the 
WelL-Being .House 
. dec;li~ated . -to 
the spiritual and mental lives of 
students. At one time or another, 
Brendan, Jean, and Quinn have all 
lived within its walls. John, who 
graduated from the University of 
Connecticut with a philosophy 
degree in 2001, was a frequent 
guest. Together, they cultivated a 
-mutual passion for their unconven-
tional hobby. 
"I'm a musician," says Brendan, 
"and all of my equipment is from 
dumpsters 
amps, speakers, you 
. " 
name 1t. 
"I once found ninety dollar 
Diesel sneakers;" says Jean. 
"Forty boxes of douche," says 
Quinn. 
The team was inspired by 
Wesleyan upperclassmen. "They 
sort of transferred it to us, and we 
spread their advice," Jean says. "At 
first, we would go by ourselves. 
Then we started emailing each 
other inventory lists of our finds. 
Workshops were a . natural transi-
tion from there." 
Last year, Jean and Brendan be-
gan holding dumpster diving infor-
mation sessions for their classmates. 
Sponsored by the Earth House, the 
workshops attract between twenty 
and thirty people, who come to 
learn about the best routes to take, 
ways to identify good sites, and how 
to clean up dumpsters after diving. 
Brendan's handwritten flyer for the 
event calls it a "workshop for · be-
ginners and prof~ssional~ alike." 
After conducting four work-
shops, Jean had accumulated an 
extensive list of dumpster diving 
aficionados, which came in handy 
when she began assembling a crew 
for Operation Ivy. After submitting 
-the proposal, she received six hun-
dred dollars 
more than she asked 
for. When May rolled around, the 
vans, crew, and itinerary were all 
set but the overarching concept was 
still under development. As Jean's 
investigations helped expand the 
scope of the project, the film's pur-
pose grew increasingly complex-
was it a vehicle for social change 
or a subcultural artifact? "I tried to 
tell my mom what we were doing," 
says Quinn. "But she just heard the 


words ~dumpster diving' and said, 
~Quinn, I hoped this day would nev-
er come.'" 


Wesleyan students aren't the 
only ones picking through 
Yale's trash: Christopher Shirley, a 
freshman in Davenport, has dump-
stered since high school in Chapel 
Hill, North Carolina. "For me," he 
says, "diving started as a service for 
others." .Shirley started by joining 
the nationwide group "Food Not 
· Bombs,'' which takes food thrown 
away by grocery stores and pre-
pares it for the homeless. The New 
Haven chapter serves .meals on 
the Green. 
Christopher, 
whose 
thick 
chestnut dreadlocks droop over 
his forehead like spindly antennae, 
wears a t-shirt that says, "Mercado 
Libertario: Really Really Free Mar-
ket." "Everything I have on" 
he 
gestures to his loose blue pants and 
shoes 
"I got for free. I've dump-
stered at Yale, for sure, especially in 
the first two weeks of school, when 
I found lamps, couches, organizers, 
shelves. Most of the time, there was 
nothing wrong with it." 


For Christopher and the cre-
ators of Operation Ivy, "trash'' is 
not a dirty word; it's a synonym 
for "freebie." This semantic differ-
ence sheds light on the overarch-
ing goal of the pursuit: Dumpster 
divers aren't simply looking for 
reusable goods 
they want to re-
define the notion of usability. And 
at Northeastern universities where · 
they filmed, they want to show that 
far too much is thrown away. 
"The real problem is, in our so-
ciety, things that are thrown away 
are then perceived differently," says 
Chris. "Once something hits a can 
or a dumpster; it's inexplicably 
transformed. People think food in 
a trash can is disgusting, even if it's 
packaged." Chris points to the free 
bread put out at midnight by Atticus 
Cafe, a local bakery that abuts Yale's 
campus. "The bread is placed in a 
garbage bag, and there's _often still 
a lot left at the end of the night. My


roommate thinks that, when faced 
with actual poverty, many people 
are afraid of finding the things they 
need in the garbage it signifies the 
crossing of a threshold." 


ccT rash is stigmatized," says 
John. «That's why most people 
don't dumpster. That's why people 
were stanng at us. 
After the Middletown crew 
has safely stashed their finds from 
the afternoon the orange tubing, 
spray pa1nt, m1rror stnps, set props, 
and several yards of yellow fabric-
they head indoors. «If you dump-
ster dive on a consistent basis," says 
Quinn, «you'll find everything you 
need: appliances, cleaning products, 
food. Everything in this room"-
he gestures towards the table and 
chairs around him 
cc can be found 
in a dumpster." 
Jean agrees. ''It's not that dif-
ferent from what normal college 
students do, when they find miscel-
laneous stuff on the streets for their 
apartments. We just do it strategi-
cally." She carries a zine the crew 
put together to advertise the work-
shops; it also provides the Mid-
dletown sanitation schedule. The 
scrappy little publication includes a 
synopsis of the film project, an ex-
cerpt from John Hoffman's The Art 
and Science of Dumpster Diving, 
and a list of tips like "Restaurants 
bad! Bakeries good!" and ccTithe 
what you dive!" 
Quinn offers another nugget. 
"You should wear gloves on your 
hands othet wise they'll look like 
mine." He stretches out his palms, 
which are weathered and pink, the 
color of his hair. "Try to make the 
whole process as clean and neat as 
possible. When you take the con-
tents out of the bag, they're no lon-
ger neat and compressed; you end 
up leaving a little mountain of litter 
behind you." 
_ 
"Wear good shoes," adds Jean. 
"Bring a flashlight, a cart. But you'll 
often find what you need to carry 
the stuff in the dumpster itself." 
«Beware of the bottom of the 
dumpster," says -Quinn. celt might 
be a reservoir for dumpster juice." A 
grimace flashes crosses his face, and 
the group takes a moment of silence 
to recall the stench and consistency 
of fluids like cat urine, rain water, 
and curdled milk. 


Yale was the first school visited by 
the film crew of Operation Ivy. 
In the weeks after their New Haven 
trip, the group shot footage at W es- -
leyan, Trinity, Harvard, and Wil-
liams. While all five schools yielded 
a substantial payoff, the content and 
contraband nature of their trash dif-
fered. Trinity, according to Quinn, 
"was full of alcohol. .. every dump-
ster had unopened booze. We found 
crates of imported beer. There was 
even homemade beer." He grins, 
then adds, «That tasted crazy." X-
rated 
paraphernalia materialized 
across the board; the group shares 
a laugh over a pornographic DVD 
they found in a Harvard dumpster, 
which they describe as cc hilarious." 
"I think it was called cin 'N 
Out,"' says Brendan. 
The group was met with vary-
ing reception. Williams College se-
curity officers kicked them off cam-
pus («They made us put our finds 
back in the trash!" cries Brendan), 
while Harvard's recycling director, 
Rob Gogan, granted them an ex-
tensive interview and a tour of the 
University's facilities. 
«Those guys really have their 
act together," says John. Like Bates, 
Harvard uses Dump and Run. Af-
ter implementing the initiative, the 
Cantabs saw a 54 percent reduction 
in waste from 2002 to 2004, and their 
post-summer «Stuff Sale" generated 
more than $70,000, which they do-
nated to Habitat for Humanity. 


By filming at schools dur-
ing their spring move-out periods, 
Operation Ivy pinpoints a specific 
problem, described by Jean's pro-
posal as cc the sheer amount of stuff 
thrown away when -housing clos-
es." At Yale, the administration's 
response to this phenomenon is 
a program called Spring Salvage, 
which positions 177 blue cc donation 
drums" around campus in hopes 
that students will drop off their re-
usable goods. 
"We walked through a big gate 
at Yale, and there were just heaps of 
things everywhere," recalls Brendan. 
«They had recycling bins out, but 
they definitely weren't big enough. 
Stuff was just lying out." 
Yale's 
waste 
is 
renowned 
amongst the diving community for 
its magnitude and quality, attracting 
locals and transients alike. ccw e met 
a real cross-section," says Brendan. 
"Other students, New Haven-ites, 
diving gurus ... regular people. One 
guy, Juan, told us that dumpstering 
by the campus had kept him in free 
shaving cream and razors for years." 
ccy ale was the best," says Jean. 
"When we got there, no one wanted 
to miss out and hold the camera, 
so the film work is a bit erratic it 
was split between five people." The 
teams' finds included several print-
ers, a Prada bag, and a wrapped lol-
lipop thai weighed three pounds. 
They're quickest to boast, however, 
about the six iPods, all of which had 
easily reparable malfunctions. 
When Jean found her second 
iPod, she was approached by a 
stranger. cci was inside a dumpster 
at the time, and was excited with my 
discovery. Then this gray-haired 
guy with a t-shirt that said 'Talk 
Trash to Me' walked up and asked, 
'Find anything?' I was like, cWho 
are you?'." 
Silver-haired C.J. May is Yale's 
only full-time recycling coordinator, 
and though he doesn't recall meet-
