To FIND THE BRAINS, SAYS DR. 
Michael Norden, don't follow the 
calculators follow the Frisbees. In 
September, Norden, a psychiatrist 
at the University of Washington, 
released a study of private universi-
. ties showing that a school's perfor-
mance in Ultimate Frisbee corre-
lates strongly with its average SAT 
score and graduation rate. Over the 
last ten years, private universities in 
the top half of the Ultimate Frisbee 
ladder have averaged an 85% grad-
uation rate, while the bottom half 
measures just sixty percent. If that's 
not enough, consider the top seven 
Ultimate schools over the stretch: 
Tufts, Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, 
Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale.

So what do the promising in-: 
tellectuals of the Yale Men,s Ulti-
mate Frisbee team think of Nor-
den's analysis? ccYou're talking to 
the wrong person," says one team 
member, ccbecause I'm not going 
to graduate." When pressed, he 
admits players need a certain intel-
ligence to consider varying veloc-
ity, calculate long trajectories, and 
interpret wind patterns. ccwell," he 
says, ccthere's quite a bit of on-the-
fly physics involved." 
His teammate replies: ccThat's a 
load of shit." 

Norden disagrees. Citing MIT 
and other mathlete schools with par-
ticularly strong teams ·for their size, 
Norden says that there 'cmay be 
something about math spatial apti-
tude that is somehow advantageous." 
Spatial aptitude? · c'I've played 
many points with a beer in hand," 
says a teammate in a bandana. 
ccWhenever we play We~leyan, they 
play barefoot. You wouldn't see 
that in many other sports." He 
recalls taking drunken slip'n'slide 
belly flops with a hometown club 
team, and describes throwing Fris-
bees to break a pinata filled with 
joints and booze. 

Perusing the Princeton Re-
view's 361 Best Colleges, Norden 
was amused to discover a list of 
schools with the happiest students. 
cc Of the same seven schools ranked 
. 
for top Ultimate," he notes, cc six 
of the seven were also among the 
highest for happiest students." He 
chuckles. ccThe only one missing, 
that you _might find interesting, 
was Harvard." 

Norden also notes that several 
stone-cold academic schools like the 
University of Chicago and Caltech 
are conspicuously missing from 
Ultimate's upper ranks. Why the 
poor showing from these on-the-fly 
physicists? The explanation, per-
haps, is that their players had water 
in hand instead of Colt 45s. ccThe 
ones that are missing from the very 
top," says Norden, are the schools 
with cc a culture that's maybe a little 
bit less fun-oriented." 

The Yale team doesn't have 
this problem. Having finished their 
warm-up tosses, they form a circle 
on the field and begin to stretch, 
soaking up the hot sun on one of 
fall's last warm days. Suddenly, a cry 
of dismay pierces the scene. ~Two 
handles. of Popov?" one player cries 
out. The vodka in question must 
nearly b~ boiling. "They've got to 
be," he shrieks, "at like a staggering 
3 5 degrees Celsius!" 

A frisbee player with a working 
knowledge of the metric system and 
the chemical properties of ethanol? 
Dr. Norden wouldn't be surprised.
