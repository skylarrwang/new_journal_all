Flip- ops are so ubiquitous that 
they're unnoticeable. Standard 
and pervasive, they are nearly as 
obvious as eet themselves.

"To find out what sort of person a man is at Yale, 
you look at his shoes," wrote Eli D.H. Marshman 
in a 1942 sketch of his classmates. "This University 
has been going for 241 years and it has found this 
to be true, and when Yale takes a stand on the mat-
ter of shoes as an indication of eligibility, Yale is 
right there is nothing more important." 

Marshman, who graduated in 1945 and won an 
Academy Award for the screenplay of Sunset Bou-
levard in 1950, used shoes to size up a man. Black 
buckskins? An inferior miscreant. White with plain 
toes and thick red rubber soles? Clearly destined 
for greatness. White with hard soles and perfora-
tions? "Cross to the other side of York street In 
the Eli caste system, he is· something akin to un-
touchable," answers Marshman. To understand the 
Yale man, Marshman peered into his sole. 

Today, Yale students reserve their suede Nu-
bucks and shiny buckskins for formal events. On 
an average Tuesday evening, during an average 
dinner rush at Commons Dining Hall, an average 
of one in three students entered wearing flip-flops. 
From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on October 10th, 31.8% or 
146 o£459 diners sported flip-flops. Others wore 
flats, sneakers, or sandals. One girl donned knee-
high boots with four-inch heels. A baby entered 
in socks. 

That infallible barometer of student interests, 
thefacebook.com, documents 328 groups with 
the word "flip-flop" in their titles. Eighteen Yale 
students listed "flip-flops,, in their profiles under 
"Interests.,, 

Between April 1, 2005 and October 10, 2006, 
Paul Richards, a shoe store on the corner of York 
and Elm, sold 315 pairs of flip-flops 
at $43.95 each. At any given time, 
the shop carries about 14 styles of 
flip-flops; this year, madras beat 
out black-and-white polka dots as 
the top seller. At Thorn Brown, a 
shoe store on Broadway, salesgirl 
April Mercure says the summer 
sandals are "still selling,, even this 
late into fall. Down the block, the 
Yale Bookstore stocks twelve differ-
ent styles, including four with Yale 
motifs. Every one of Broadway,s 
purveyors of chic J.Crew, Wish-
list, and Urban Outfitters 
sells the -
sandals to campus devotees. 

Take Kevin . Davis, who has 
16 pairs in his dorm room and ten 
more .at home, or Lillian Lwamugi-
ra, who has eight pairs at Yale. And 
then there,s Lauren Taylor, who,s 
been known to wear them in the 
snow. "And in the rain they just 
make more sense than any other 
shoes/, she argues. 

Today, it is an understatement 
to acknowledge that flip-flops are 
a Yale wardrobe staple, but thirty 
years ago, the situation was, well, 
flip-flopped. Average number of 
students wearing flip-flops in the 
1976 Yale yearbook: zero.· Flip-
flops are so ubiquitous that they,re 
unnoticeable. Standard and perva-
sive, they are nearly as obvious as 
feet themselves. 

Modeled after Japanese Zori, a 
sandal woven of straw or plant fiber, 
flip-flops probably first appeared 
as rubber imita-tions sold in drug 
stores after World War II. Until the 
1990s, they were relegated to beach-
es, gyms, and showers. 

Meghan 
Cleary, author of "The Perfect Fit: 
What Your Shoes Say About You, 
and a recognized shoe guru who 
blogs about shoes at missmeghan. 
com, has an expert opinion on when 
the fashion flip-flop bonanza began. 
"It was the summer of 1998... It 
was that summer that some of the 
fashionista girls starting buying the 
flip-flops in Chinatown and wear-
ing them with jeans with skirts and 
dresses all over the East Village,,, she 
notes. Stores like Pearl River Mart 
acquired cult status among New 
York trendsetters, who incorporat-
ed flip-flops into their wardrobes in 
droves. In Rio and Paris, chicettes 
would never pair flip-flops with 
couture. But the flip-flop was never 
intended to grace a runway. It is 
rooted in traditions of convenience 
and dirt. Not surprisingly, the style 
became trendy at colleges, where 
dirt is a problem and convenience is 
an objective. 

Flip-flops are cool, effortless, af-
fordable fashion. People try hard to 
look like they're not trying, to hide 
their intense scrutiny of the world 
around them in a veil of breezy 
nonchalance. But no dress choice is 
without meaning. We are surround-
ed by signifiers of our own making. 
Everything is connotative . 

s Roland Barthes admits in 
'ccBlue is in Fashion This Year,: 
A Note on Research into Signifying 
Units in Fashion Clothing,, cloth-
ing may not carry meaning in the 
same way that language does, "but 
I am right at least to apply a lin.: 
guistic method of analysis to it., 

In this spirit, in Yale,s spirit, it is a 
reasonable assumption that the flip-
flops that traipse on our collegiate 
stomping grounds are provocative, 
self-referential signifiers. 

At Yale, the flip-flop has a 
grammatica function that footwear 
lacks at other colleges: the Y~·sllape.­
created by the straps that stretch out 
from between the big and pointer 
toes. The shoe inscribes feet with 
the University's alphabetical sig-
nifier, even as the shoe serves as a 
subtle rebellion against an old-boy 
Yale of nubucks and buckskins. We 
unconsciously mark ourselves with 
it. The ego, in search of meaning, 
necessarily searches for signs, un-
