ing Jean and her crew, her account
seems plausible: "When I see scav-
engers, dumpster divers, I'll often
poke my head in and ask, 'How's
it going?"' He doesn't reprimand
them. "If people. stopped dumpster
diving, .the amount of waste on our
hands around here would increase
tremendously."


While the . crew of Operation
Ivy· is critical of the overflow that
evades the dona~ion . drums, they
may have ignored recent improve-
ments. In 2005, Spring Salvage col-
lected 18 tons of belongings
far
less than the amount collected at
Bates, a school with only 1,600
students to Yale's 5,300. This year,
however, Yale Recycling more than
doubled its intake, collecting 38
tons of reusable goods.


C.J. attributes the gain to the
acquisition of warehouse space, a
pair -of recycling trucks, and a team
of approximately 20 students. The
new system, similar to Dump and
Run in that reusables are strategi-
cally collected and stored, differs in
its final application. "Yale doesn't
like the idea of selling things, as
there a,re liabilities. So, instead, we
invite ninety New Haven non-prof-
its to come to the warehouse," he
explains. After the non-profits sign
forms to clear the University of re-
sponsibility, they can then use or
sell the goods as they see fit.


There is still, however, the
problem of education what John
refers to as "the supply side of
trash." Despite the efforts of Yale
Recycling, C.J. admits that "50% of
what ends up in the dumpsters here
is reusable.'' Most students know
the customary recyclable materi-
als
paper, cardboard, glass
but
are unlikely to donate items that
are similarly useful, like a half-used
bottle of laundry detergent. Or a
broken iPod.


f dumpster diving reduces waste
buildup
and
reassigns
value
to the goods that society has left
behind, why does Harvard's Re-
cycling Coordinator Rod Gogan
•
disavow it on camera? It may be a
matter of legality. Because dump-
sters are often located on private
property, removing their contents
is technically trespassing.


"It's illegal to actually get into
a dumpster," says Jean, "what with
the liabilities and all. But most
people want others to take their
stuff, so they'll look the other way."


Even though many choose to ig-
nore dumpster divers, the ambigu-:-
ous legality can make divers jittery.
"Once, I was inside of a dumpster,"
recalls Christopher, "and a police
officer walked up to me. I was pret-
ty nervous, but all he said was, 'Re-
cycle and reuse."'


"Cops usually don't care," af-
firms Quinn. "It's business owners
who get upset; they'll consistently
come out of their stores to scare
away div~rs. I had some friends
who used to dumpster behind a de-
partment store. To discourage them,
the manager dumped rose oil on the
bags. My friends were like, 'Sweet,
this smells good now."'


Others think that dumpster
diving is an invasion of privacy-
sometimes, the skeletons in people's
closets turn up in their wastebaskets.
''In a way, I can understand why
people don't like divers," says John.
''When you see someone going
through your trash, it's upsetting."


Jean, Quinn, and Brendan have all
found personal items while dump-
stering: diaries, ID' s, credit cards.
"It explains why the most common
reaction we get is awkwardness,"
says Brendan.


Not everyone, however, reacts
to dumpster div€.rs with disdain or
trepidation. "One night at Yale,"
recalls Jean, "I was going through
a dumpster near 0 ld Campus,
throwing the stuff I wanted onto
the street
"


Quinn interjects, "It looked
like someone had been dumped and
their ex had thrown all of their stuff
out the window."


"So I was on the lip of the
dumpster," continues Jean. "It was
pretty late, and a New Haven bus

stopped next to me. The ~river got
out of the bus and asked me if I
was alright
she offered to buy me
some food. I told her I was fine, but
she insisted, and returned with a
Philly cheese steak ·and some juice.
Another guy gave me a hamburger.
I didn't have the heart to tell them I


was a vegetanan.


Quinn laughs. "Once, when
we were diving, a guy walked by
and said, 'Be careful kids
it's ad-
dictive.' He's right: Jean will dump-
ster for ten . hours. She's a total
dd.
a
ct.


Jean shrugs. "Unlike most peo-
ple, I didn't get into dumpster div-
ing because of environmentalism;
it's something I've just done for a
long time. But as plans for the mov-
ie progressed, I realized I wanted to
come up with policies that address
the issues I'm coming across."


Passing observers, Williams
security
officers,
and Quinn's
mother may see dumpstering as a
worthless pursuit, but Operation
Ivy aims to prove otherwise. When
extracted from a dumpster and held
up to the light, a dark cutout can be
reassessed as a monkey, an acrobat,
or a strongman; when documented
on film, the apparently lowly act
of seeking out garbage can he simi-
larly redefined.


"We want to break the stigma
that surrounds trash," says John.
"We want colleges to imple-
ment better recycling programs,"


Jean nods, . her eyes lighting
with purpose. "We want to make a
good movie."
