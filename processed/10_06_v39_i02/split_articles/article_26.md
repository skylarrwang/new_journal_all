EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
fter two hours of diving prac-
tice, my hair is crusted and 
chlorinated, and I'm sporting 
undersized blue U mbro shorts that I 
have probably owned since the fourth 
grade. Feeling unattractive, I pull my 
white socks over my shins and head up 
the stairs to the Payne-Whitney fitness 
' 
center. In contrast to its modernized, 
sleek, and severe counterparts, Payne 
Whitney has remained defiantly tra-
ditional. Its faux-gothic architecture 
and its murals of American industrial-
ists like Rockefeller and Bush, hard at 
work during their days as Eli athletes, 
distinguishes the gym from its peers. 
Gold's Gym may·offer complementary 
protein shakes and grab-bag deals for 
Brazilian bikini waxes, but the Yale 
Gymnasium appears to strive for pure 
Ivy League accomplishment. 

But after passing through the aus-
tere corridors, I find myself in a sur-
prisingly standard gym. On the left, 
the ellipticals and tread-mills whirl 
into oblivion while the medieval tor-
ture devices we call "weight machines" 
fill the space to my right. Af-
ter a brief scan of the scene, I 
try to focus on my workout 
like the serious Ivy League 
athlete Payne Whitney Gym 
demands me to be. 

Yet after a while, my focus 
wavers. I can't help it, and nei-
ther could you. I~ the weight 
area, dozens of guys grunt, 
inflating their bodies to im-
press the girls, who are bus-
ily sweating to dwindle away 
pounds in the cardio zon~. 
First, I notice a young man 
pumping away with dumb 
bells beside me whose groans 
of anguish attract stares from 
around the gym. Brilliant 
white Nike low-tops high-
light his taut, bulging calves. 
He wears shiny red basket-
ball shorts and a wifebeater 
that strains against his body with each 
surge of blood to his massive lats. His 
brown hair is freshly . trimmed, gelled, 
and spiked, and he carefully pats it after 
finishing his set. He also adjusts the red 
and white Livestrong bracelets around 
his wrists 
this is a man who not only 
cares for AIDS patients and the pov-
erty-stricken, but he knows how to 
color-coordinate. Drops of perspira-
tion dot his forehead, but this gentle-
man is well-versed in the etiquette of 
attracting athletic harlots. He slowly 
lifts his shirt to wipe the sweat off his 
face and reveals completely by acci-
dent! 
a rippling six pack. The stench 
of salty sweat and sharp cologne may 
have addled my wits, but I swear I 
see this Narcissus mouth, "You're the 
bomb" to himself in the mirror. 

· I pull my eyes away from his sor-
did performance, wondering whom he 
could possibly hope · to attract, when 
I notice his perky female counterpart 
thrashing away on -an elliptical. She 
wears trendy blue mesh shoes, which 
conveniently match the spandex booty 
shorts designed to accent her tanned, 
waxed legs. She's got that ubiquitous 
Tiffany's heart necklace dangling in her 
cleavage, silver studs studding her ears, 
and dark brown hair so immaculately 
straightened that it reflects the gym's 
florescent light like a metallic shield. 
She repeatedly smacks her lips to 
ensure the lip gloss hasn't gone any-
where and removes her hands from 
the elliptical bars to check that her 
blue eye shadow hasn't migrated down 
cheeks more orange than tan. When 
all is ship-shape, she throws her head 
back and gazes intently at the glossy 
magazine propped before her. 

As they aggressively pout in the 
wall-to-wall mirror, I hope that these 
two manage to look away long enough 
to notice one another. They'll have a 
flirtaceous encounter in which he'll 
casually brush back his hair inci-
dentally flexing his bicep before hus-
kily asking her what she's doing later. 
Together, they'll saunter away, leaving 
this athletic cocktail lounge surging 
with hormones and the mating scents 
of Old Spice and Ralph Lau-
ren perfume. 

How stressful it must be 
for these performers, who 
tone their bodies to attract 
admirers outside the gym 
while also striving for optimal 
sexiness inside these hallowed 
walls. Behind its fa~ade, Payne 
Whitney is the scene of the 
same grotesque mating ntu-
als found at gyms across the 
country. While I watch over-
muscled studs chug powdery 
protein shakes and spandexed 
vixens writhe on vinyl mats, I 
realize how unexceptionally 
shallow Payne Whitney really 
is. I shake my head and return 
to my lonely workout. But 
wait-do my blue Umbros 
look way too small when I 
bend my legs like that?
