When a two-year-old has lived with a bottle for his entire life, getting him to give it up can be tricky. There's a glue that binds him to the feel of the plastic nipple and the readily accessible juice. But that glue has to be broken, though the process can be painful. While this child is adjusting to milk from a sipper cup, just a few rooms away his mother is undergoing group therapy to overcome her own more destructive addiction. Located on Howe Street in downtown New Haven, Amethyst House is an organization that helps mothers overcome their drug addictions in a live-in program while providing intensive support and treatment for their young children. 

Women enter the program on their own initiative. The program is essentially fee; the women pay with welfare checks to emphasize the role they play in their own recovery. Mothers may bring children five years old or younger. These condensed families live and work together in order to keep the program running. Daily chores are divided among the women receiving treatment, and a network of relationships builds quickly. Mothers take turns watching each other's children, soon developing attachments to those in their care. The program provides the stability these kids have lacked for much of their lives. 

"The issues are so out there with kids-neglect is here. It's a part of life," said Bernetta Witcher-Boeteng, program director. "But these kids love their mothers, and they want to be with them." 

Children frequently enter with emotional issues, speech problems and, in some infants, body rigidity stemming from heroin damage in utero. Amethyst does not treat severe physical problems but deals with the impact drug-addicted parents have on their children. 

"It is crucial to intervene while these kids are younger," said Witcher-Boeteng. "Most of the impact is environmental. It is stability versus insanity." 

In therapeutic nursery school groups, kids begin to learn skills to help them interact with their peers. According to Wendy Cohn, the children in her care must learn how to express themselves verbally, emotionally, and artistically, and how to get along in a peaceful way with the others. 

Along with developing social skills, the nursery school works in conjunction with therapy to reinforce progress. For example, young children with articulation problems may be taught a form of sign language that is used by the therapist, the mother, and the nursery school teacher. As language develops further, teachers begin to reinforce what the child vocalizes, and sign language becomes obsolete. 

Amethyst does not stop at alleviating language and peer interaction problems. Bill Mannie, parent educator and family clinician, works with mothers and children in a weekly session called Watch, Wait, and Wonder to repair mother/child relationships. Many children who enter the program are the victims of abuse and neglect, and have had to care for themselves and often younger siblings. "These sessions reestablish trust," said Cohn. "The kids are taught new coping strategies and skills along with their mothers in a safe and secure place." 

Often, a stay at Amethyst House puts women back on their feet and in a position to take control of their lives, as well as the lives of their children. However, things do not always work as planned. Women relapse, leave without notice, miss sessions and bring in illegal substances, which often means the end of a stay at Amethyst for the women and their children. A lapse in recovery places kids with relatives or in foster care--as social workers and the courts decide--and the chances of the mother regaining custody are uncertain. 

Such a transition tears at the stability Amethyst has worked to build. 

For those kids still living in the small family bedrooms across the hall from the nursery, life continues as usual. Ultimately, however, the goal is for families to leave Amethyst. The program is available to women for a year, after which the staff hopes that families will be able to live on their own without further problems with drugs or alcohol. Ideally, Amethyst gives children the time to develop at a normal pace in a healthy setting, leaving them with skills that can be taken to public school and eventually out into their lives, ending the abuse and instability of their early childhood.
