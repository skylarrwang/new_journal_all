EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
We pull out into the open. The engine whines, rising and 
falling with acceleration, and the flashing hazard lights lend our 
project a certain urgency. Underneath it all the curb brooms brush 
the street with a calming skksssh. As we watch, a second driver 
swings his machine out of the garage, barreling 6ackwards. 

Domingo drives through the city at five miles per hour, always 
leaning sideways intently, to make sure the curb brooms on the 
right side are in alignment. He is completely in his element and 
directs the machine expertly. He is so intent on his job that he has 
difficulty driving and talking at the same time, and pauses the 
sweeper often to talk to me. 

We run red lights. Domingo explains that at five miles per 
hour, nobody can afford to wait for the lights to change. But deep 
inside we both know that nobody's going to mess with an ugly 
metal machine the size of a garbage truck with big flashing lights. 
We can go where we please. 

At two in the morning, we pass through the Hill neighbor-
hood. Domingo is quieter now, and I look out the windows. It feels 
like the middle of a war zone as we pass by the dilapidated husks of 
houses, gray in the dark. Only a few teenagers are our at this hour. 
Domingo ignores alJ this, running the sweeper over piles of 
leaves, spilled liquids, plastic bags, styrofoam cups, vodka bottles 
and roued vegetables. Where we've gone, there remain only three 
neat tracks of water on the scrubbed asphalt. Crisply directing the 
steering wheel, Domingo cleans out the Hill while nobody is look-
ing. Either because of Domingo's competent driving, or because I 
always associate sleep with the machine's noises, I slowly nod off. 

I'm awakened at 2:20 by the radio squawking. It's time for 
Domingo to unload his basket of trash. He stops the machine and 
waits. Minutes later, a dump truck rounds the corner and barrels 
past us, screeching on the brakes and parking sideways in the street. 

After Domingo unloads his trash, I hitch a ride with Larry 
Williams in the dump truck. A friendly black man, he had seemed 
quieter sitting in the office. But he has another side: for a second 
now he is chatty. The first few hours for the dump truck operator 
are pretty boring until the sweepers start to fill up, and he's been 
cooped up watching television. 

The bench is low-slung and comfortable, and Larry directs our 
course with ease, obviously taking pleasure in pushing his laboring 
vehicle as if it were a regular car. He talks a little bit, relaxed, and 
we listen ro the radio. He seems almost like a father figure to the 
night crew. Perhaps it is because he is the sole common thread in an 
otherwise lonely job, bringing the distanced street sweepers togeth-
when he meets them. 

We go down the streets of New Haven, and things become 
familiar as we pass through Yale's campus. We are going to 
up with another street sweeper, my second ride of the night. 

Outside Ingalls Rink, a street sweeper waits on the corner with 
garbage basket already raised in the air. Larry pulls in neatly 
its side, and opens the door to watch. Herbie Ancrum, the 
operator, pulls forward and dumps the load softly into the 
of the dump truck-a sweet smell permeates the cab. Herbie 
shakes the arms of the machine to loosen the clinging debris, and 
gives the dump truck a couple love taps for good measure. 

Herbie has a different style of driving than Domingo. He leans 
casually over one arm as he directs the curb broom, wiggling the 
wheel left and right with his other arm. The Yale streets are rela-
tively clean, mostly leaves, a whole different feeling than the Hill 
neighborhood. Herbie drives up Science Hill, removing the grit 
from the curbs. "You know these buildings?" he asks me, in a 
friendly way that makes it easy to say yes. 

At 3 AM the machine needs water, and Herbie stops. We break 
open a fire hydrant outside of the Divinity School. It's nice to stop 
and be outside; it's comparatively quiet and there's a good breeze. 
We talk. Herbie is the first person I've met tonight who is more 
interested in just chatting with another human being than explain-
ing the mechanics of his job to an outsider. 

Herbie works for the Community Action Agency part-time 
and drives meals to the elderly. He reUs me about his six-year-old 
daughter. I tell him about maybe wanting to teach, and we half-joke 
about me teaching her some day at Yale. Talking to Herbie, I gain a 
new perspective. I think to myself that while Domingo drives the 
street sweeper because the job fits him weU, Herbie drives the 
machine in resignation to the reality of providing for a family. 

When the machine is done drinking, Herbie starts up again 
and we go through Science Park. All the lights are on and, unlike 
the HiiJ, it feels like everyone is out at a party and we're just going 
through cleaning house. We pass the quiet ranks of Albertus 
Magnus and swing back towards campus. 

When Herbie's crash basket is full again-a bit faster than I had 
hoped-he calJs Larry in the dump truck to empty his basket out. 
It's time for me to head back. Larry gives me a ride to Public Works. 

A friend once said to me that people need something new to 
distinguish one day from the next. And it is clear from this night 
that street sweeping is, in essence, a duU and thankless Labor. So I 
am tempted to conclude that there is nothing truly interesting 
about these people and their after-hours work. 

But I end the evening sitting in the dump truck in the middle 
of the parking lot at Public Works, charting over the radio. They are 
suddenly sentimental, these sweepers, cleaning the city at night 
when nobody is around to see. I finally realize, perhaps roo late, that 
what is interesting about this night is not the novelty of the street 
sweeping machines, but rather encounter with the men who oper-
ate them. 

I say good-bye to Domingo and wish him the best. Lynwood 
comes on the radio to crack a couple jokes. Next to me, Larry leans 
against the far window of the cab, and casually directs me in prop-
er radio protocol. Herbie jokes again about me teaching his daugh-
ter one day at Yale, and we both silently think that that would be 
nice.
