Whence grace

The Yale Musical Instrument collection lies hidden behind the unassuming facade of its own building on Hillhouse Avenue, in the shadow of University Health Services. It is one of the most revered and distinguished collections of musical instruments in the world.

Currently in a climate-controlled environment with top security, the collection was not always treated so carefully. Begun primarily with keyboard instruments, its first home was the dome of Woolsey Hall, which left the rare and valuable instruments vulnerable to an uncontrolled environment.

Morris Steinert, who later co-founded the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, made the first major donation to the collection in 1900. After his initial gift, donations came gradually until 1959, when a donation of a large part of Yale Schlemmer's extensive collection put Yale on the map of notable musical instrument collections. It was Schlemmer's donation that convinced the Yale administration to move the instruments from the hazards of Woolsey into their own home on Hillhouse.


Through the years, Belle Schlemmer acquired an impeccable taste for the quality and rarity of instruments she collected. Schlemmer acquired a large portion of her instruments from France, which was a feat in itself because of strict exportation rules. The French museums always reserved the right to buy instruments back before they were shipped out of France. Since, however, Schlemmer donated generously to small French cities that had been all but destroyed during World War I, she received special treatment from the French government. This privilege would eventually help make Yale the owner of one of the world's most important and well-balanced collections of musical instruments.


The instruments are exquisite and ornate, many inlaid with mother of pearl, ivory, tortoise shell, or delicately carved parchment. One harpsichord, made by the world-famous Pascal Taskin, was being used as an ironing board when it was discovered. The collection also includes such rarities as a working-stick violin. Another valuable holding, an instrument named the "third world," is one of several instruments traditionally considered "beggars' instruments" because of their visual attraction and accessibility. Other instruments in the collection are rumored to have once belonged to Mozart and Handel. Yet another valuable piece of the keyboard collection supposedly came from Marie Antoinette's royal court, because it displays the tiny symbol of two red pierced hearts, a symbol only she was allowed to use.


Although these connections to famous figures are speculative, the instruments do not need fame to assert their greatness. Their existence is just as humble as the building they live in; much of the Yale community remains completely unaware of this quiet claim to fame. The instruments' presence as musical and visual works of art, however, is quietly but fully felt.
