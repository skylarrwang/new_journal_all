We s t Nile 
s cientists have 
of 
an outbreak 
Encephalitis- for now. 
Experiment Station scientists had isolated the vuus, but the bird 
deaths still had them doubting whether the pathogen they had iso-
lated was the Sr. Louis strain. The coc confirmed their suspicions: 
the outbreak was not St. Louis fever, but a similar viral infection 
called West Nile fever--a virus with no previous documented 
appearance in the Western Hemisphere. 

U 
pon the announcement that a virus from Africa-bringing 
horrific images of Ebola to the puolic mind-had appeared 
on American soil, questions immediately arose: How dangerous is 
it? Are our kids safe outside? Should we let them go to school? 
Hc:aJth departments' aavisorics to avoid mosquilOes contradicted 
reassurances from expens that the virus would not affect most of 
the population. Town officials in southwestern Connecticut met 
with scientists, who convinced them that the outbreak would nor 
be severe. These same scientists, however, faced a problem which 
they would rather have p~ented but nevertheless find exhilarating 
to fight. "It' an exotic virus and it's here," Andreadis explains. "For 
a scientist, it's very intriguing and very exciting." 

Andreadis knows Connecticut's disca.sc-causing insects as well 
as anyone. Since 1978, he has srudied the state's six-legged residents 
at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Now, he serves 
as head of the Soil and Water department, srudying the control of 
mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases. He works on the second 
floor of the Slate Building, the newest of the five buildings that 
make up the Station's headquarters on Huntington Street in north-
ern New Haven. 

T he oldest building is the Osborne Library. built in 1882 when 
the Experiment Station opened at its current site. Now, tucked 
behind a building So years its junior, Osborne serves as a reminder 
of the Station's humble beginnings. Just inside the front door sits a 
display describing some of the research that occurs on site. 

Educational posters fill the laboralOry hallways. One of these 
posters, describing the Asian Cerarnbycid beetle that has recently 
appeared in the u.s., sits outside the office of Dr. Louis Magnarelli, 
vice-director of the experimental station. As Magnarelli proudly 
points out, the displays are just one example of the Station's goal to 
work with and educate the citizens of Connecticut. 

"We're not an ivory tower here," Magnarclli says in die ento-
mology library next to his office. The library holds some books that 
curators would gladly welcome at the Beinccke Rare Book Library. 
Magnarclli opens up one textbook, finding the date. Ir turns out co 
be from 1945, and he puts it back. "That one's not that old." He 
finaJiy finds another, from 1877. Then, hidden on the bottom shelf,

a book nor quite as old catches the eye of the 54-year-old scientist. 
He opens up the book, his voice revealing his excitement at finding 
the reports of WE. Britton, the first man to hold rhe position of 
chief state entomologist-the position Magnarelli now holds. These 
98-year-old records shar rhe room with samples of various insects, 
impaled on pins and displayed in drawers on the far wall. 

In the dusty libr:try. the research being conducted down the 
hall is easily forgotten. !"he educational displays, small brick build-
ings and garden plot obscure the significant discoveries being 
made-like the discovery of vitamin A by Station scientists in 1913 
or the development of h} brid corn in 1922. The small garden, locat-
ed next to the parking lot, might be part of the next major advance-
ment to sprout from the Research Station. And now, researchers at 
the Station join those from rhe coc, University of Connecticut, 
Yale and elsewhere to search for answers in one of the most 
significant events in recent epidemiological and infectious disease 
history. 

W 
hile Epidemiologins understand that they cannot prevent 
every epidemic or vaccinate for every disease. "Are we sur-
prised this happened? No,' says Dr. Carner, a 15-year veteran of 
Connecticut's Public Health Department. "Arc we surprised that it's 
West Nile fever? Yes. ' !"he significance of the appearance of the 
West Nile virus in th1s liemisphere overshadows the effect of the dis-
ease itself. The virus can only be held responsible for six deaths, all 
in New York-nor quire an epidemic. In Connecticut, the 
Oeparunenr of Public llealth is not aware of any infections in 
humans. Bur that doe~ not rule our the possibility that the virus 
may have infiltrated rhe human population. AJI six of the victims 
who died from West Nile Encephalitis were over the age of 65. In 
most healthy human hosts, the virus only causes mild Au-like symp-
toms-nor something chat sends most sufferers to the doctor's 
office. But if West Nile can spread this quickly-the virus was 
found in birds from Madison, Conn., to New Jersey and Long 
Island-then other. more virulent parasites can as well. Viruses 
from Ebola to Dengue fever spring to mind, as well as less exotic 
tropical diseases, like malaria (once a common problem in 
Connecticut). Malaria, like West Nile fever, is an arbovirus: a virus 
transmitted by mosquitoes. To prevent arboviruses from spreading 
in Connecticut, the Department of Public Health, the Department 
of Environmental Protection and the Agricultural Experiment 
Station work together co analyze and confront mosquito-borne ill-
ne~es.
