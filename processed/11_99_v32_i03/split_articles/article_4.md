Her voice negotiating a path between resolute politician and placating mother, State Senator Toni Harp assures me that a recent Connecticut law mandating HIV testing for newborns benefits born infants and rheir families. The law, as Harp explains it, prescribes routine and uniform HIV resting within 48 hours of birth and is primarily intended to limit HTV contraction by newborns. She elaborates with an impressive statistic-the 30 percent risk of an infant receiving HIV from its mother can be reduced to 8 percent if the baby is treated within 48 hours. Harp labors through her endorsement of the law before accelerating to rehearsed sound bites: "Children deserve the right to have someone care for them knowing what they're up against. What mother wouldn't want this?" 

Her plea is convincing. Who would oppose a law seeking to combat HIV transmission to infants? But, as legal briefs challenging the law indicate, it's not that simple. 

The 31 member hospitals of the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA), in concert with other Connecticut medical facilities, have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the statute. Why would hospitals oppose such legislation benefitting newborns? The answer to this question lies outside the frame of public health in the murkier areas of privacy, patient-doctor relations. Viewed in terms of these rights and privileges, the law no longer seems the boon to public welfare that Harp champions. 

"It's a back-door way of testing the mother," Jennifer Jackson, general counsel for the CHA, crisply asserts. "Newborns do not create their own antibodies, so any test of the newborn's antibodies is actually a test of the mother." The law, it turns out, is not precisely what Harp has explained. HIV tests are not routinely administered to every newborn-only to those whose mothers have refused testing during pregnancy. If the woman has not been tested earlier in her pregnancy, she is tested during active labor unless she objects in writing. Her objection is ultimately meaningless, however, because her child's antibodies-which are the mother's, not the child's own-are tested at birth, revealing the mother's HIV status. A positive test result does not indicate that the child has contracted HIV, but merely that the mother is HIV positive. 

Senator Harp compares HIV testing to routine testing for other conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia. When I ask about the stigma associated with AIDS, Harp admits that women may be concerned. "People fear the test will get into the wrong hands and have a negative impact"-she quickly glides back into politician mode-"but the issues have changed. People are living with AIDS, not dying. We focus on how to support people while they live and work. We need to get the word out." Her enthusiasm is disconcertingly saccharine compared to Jackson's candid warning. "AIDS needs to be treated, prevented, and handled differently from other diseases," she cautions. "The stigma associated with AIDS is a genuine threat." 

The CHA argues that testing a woman's antibodies against her will, however circuitously, constitutes an unreasonable search forbidden by the Fourth Amendment. 

The law also violates a woman's right to privacy, claims the CHA, because the testing invades her body and is not confidential. At least one other person-the doctor-has access to the results. 

Privacy and Fourth Amendment rights are legitimate concerns. For the CHA, they are also valuable weapons in winning a judicial battle. In the United States, where controversial political debates are often played out in the courtroom, it's best to be well armed with constitutional protections and court precedents. But for the medical professionals involved, legal considerations are secondary to the health risks of compulsory HIV testing. 

For one, the HIV test isn't infallible. With a false positive rate of approximately one percent, the test will incorrectly diagnose roughly 420 infants born in Connecticut per year, the CHA claims. These infants are likely to be treated with powerful drugs such as AZT, the long-term effects of which are not yet known, and the false diagnosis will also place unnecessary stress on the mother during the already stressful postpartum period. 

More important to the CHA, however, is the burden placed on patient-doctor relations. "The law is in many ways counterproductive," insists Jackson. "When the mother is tested against her will, this violates the trust between her and her provider, and she may cease to seek health care." The law only mandates testing for HIV, not treatment. If a woman feels that the system is working against rather than with her, she may abandon courses of treatment and even avoid giving birth at the hospital. 

The CHA, Jackson is quick to emphasize, does not oppose all testing but maintains that "a therapeutic, rather than coercive, setting enhances the mother's trust in the medical community and prompts her to take appropriate health measures." Also, testing the child is far less effective than testing the mother during pregnancy, because most HIV transmission occurs during labor and delivery, and caesarean-section deliveries and proper drugs can reduce HIV transmission rates to three percent. 

The CHA boasts that the system it advocates-comprehensive prenatal counseling with testing strongly recommended-yields voluntary testing rates of approximately 99 percent of pregnant women. 

Ultimately, then, the question is not whether testing is desirable. No one wants infants to be born with HIV, and all concur that testing is a necessary first step in preventing transmission of the virus. Who can disagree with Senator Harp that mothers should want to take all measures necessary to reduce the chances of passing HIV on to their children, including testing themselves and their infants? 

But the controversy surrounding the new law extends far beyond blood tests, plucking insistently at the tension between government regulations and individual rights, public welfare and personal privacy. Is a guess at a child's HIV status worth the risk of isolating the mother from the medical establishment? Is it wise to strong-arm the relatively few women who will not test voluntarily, or would it be wiser to mandate counseling that appeals to maternal concerns? Ultimately, the courts must decide which will dictate social policy: government paternalism or maternal rights.
