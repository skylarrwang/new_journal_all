ON NOVEMBER 23, 1969, 1,500 DEMONSTRATORS GATHERED 
in front of the u.s. embassy in London. News of a massacre 
of South Viemamese civilians by American troops had just 
surfaced, and young people took to the streets. The protestors salut-
ed embassy officials with the Nazi "Sieg Heil!" and burned an 
American flag while chanting "u.s. murderers!" The crowd then 
proceeded to the British Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing 
Street, chanting "Lenin! Stalin! Mao Tse-tung!" as they marched. 
Most of the demonstrators were British, but there were a few 
Americans among the crowd. One of them was Yale's current pres-
ident, Richard C. Levin. Another was an acquaintance of Levin's 
and an organizer of the protestÂ· named Bill Clinton. Clinton was at 
Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship; Levin, a runner-up for the 
Rhodes, was there as well, having received an English-Speaking 
Union fellowship. 

Thiery years later, both men--:>nce such outspoken critics of 
the establishment-are at its helm. Clinton runs the country he 
once protested against; Levin leads one of its foremost educational 
institutions. Looking back today, Levin is sorry that his own ambi-
tion manifested itself much later than Clinton's: "His clear focus on 
elective politics as a future and his clear sense of direction at a time 
when so many of us were just testing out ideas of what we were 
going to do with our lives was really impressive." While Levin cer-
tainly developed into a man of ambition, he was still "just testing 
out ideas" when he arrived at Yale in the fall of 1970 as a graduate 
student in economics. 

The ideas Levin was testing out were radical ones which had 
been strictly off limits to precocious minds like his until the Civil 
Rights and Free Speech movements of the early 196os began to chal-
lenge America's hard-line Cold War consensus. Levin's graduate 
class was the most radical in the history of the economics depart-
ment. In the. words of classmate Ed Wolff, now a professor at NYU, 
"The Yale economics department ... admitted a large number of rad-
ical students in the fall of 1970. Whether that was done on purpose 
or not is another issue. [In either case] it was just a blip, a one-rime 
CVC:nt. The following year's class was much more traditional." Joel 
Mokyr, a mirthful Israeli who was described to me as "the right-
winger" of Levin's class, quipped, "anyone of sane mind would have 
been to the right of that class." 

While the class's saniry was debatable, all agree that Levin's 
mind was one of its sharpest. He was "one of the leading lights of 
[our] class," said Jack Wells, now a Democratic staffer on Capitol 
Hill. Richard Murnane, who now teaches at Harvard, remembers 
him as "a real smart guy that was open to a wide range of ideas. [He] 
knew a lot about history [and] had a penchant for theory." Levin 
apparently made a similar impression on his professors. He was 
selected as a T.A. for a section of the economic history course in only 
his second year, an honor unheard of at the time. 

But in the early 1970s, the issues attracting student attention 
were outside the classroom, or more correctly, peripheral to it. "At 
a meeting of the new class, someone said 'whoever's interested in 
URPE come upstain,' and when we got upstairs, there were a lot of 
us," recalls classmate Laurie Nisonoff. The Union of Radical 
Political Economists, or URPE (pronounced "ER-pee"), was an orga-
nization ofleftist economics professors and graduate students. URPE 
saw itself as an alternative to the economics profession's mainstream 
professional organization, the American Economic Association. 

URPE's academic aim was to expose students to the radical alterna-
tives to the neo-classical economics they were being taught. The 
Yale graduate students' URPE chapter sponsored radical speakers and 
study groups, like one on Marx's Capital. "Richard Levin was actu-
ally a member of these [study] groups," Wolff remembers. "I 
thought he really knew his Marxism," recalls Marianne Hill, anoth-
er member of his class. 

But being knowledgeable about Marx and being a Marxist are 
two different things. Levin had studied the history of economic 
thought at Stanford and Oxford and narurally had spent time on 
Marx. While Mokyr referred to him as "a self-proclaimed Marxist" 
and a fellow member of the Marxist study group remembers him as 
"an eloquent and trenchant critic of capitalism," Wells disagreed. 
"His acciviry was not so much an indication of political commit-
ment as of intellectual curiosity. He was open to new ideas." Levin 
himself said, "[I was) less of a critic than an eclectic"-a man' who 
studied many theories, but had no strong ideological attachments 
to any of them. 

Regardless of his true beliefs, Levin's apparent openness to all 
sides aided him in his rise to the top. Levin's 6rst taste of power 
came when he was chosen by his economics classmates to represent
