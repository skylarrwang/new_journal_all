around, but a strategy: make your school put your money where 
your mouth is. "Basically, we were trying co use universities eco-
nomically through their licensing fees, to change the dynamic of the 
industry," says Eric Brakken, a University of Wisconsin graduate 
and founder of the anti-sw~hop movement, who now works full 
rime for USAS. 


The classical model of student activism in America has been 
sos, the Weathermen, the takeover of Columbia: large numbers of 
students using dramatic tactics to lobby their government directly 
for widespread political and social transformation. But that picture 
has changed, at least since the anti-apartheid movement in the '8os, 
when a shantytown went up on Beinecke Plaza, not to influence the 
government but to convince Yale to divest from South Africa. "We 
have our roots in the apartheid struggles of the early '8os, the last 
spurt of this kind of activism," says Champagne. "We're using uni-
versities co make a statement and getting them to act as moral 
agentS. The only time they actuaJly act is when students make their 
voices heard." 


The student voice that has caught the ear of universities in the 
last few years has spoken in remarkably measured tones. The 
imagery of sweatshop repression and abuse is stirring, but the plat-
form is technical and legalistic, not revolutionary. Two of USAS's 
three key demands are regulatory: public disclosure of factory loca-
tions and monitoring of working conditions by independent 
human and labor-rights organizations. They seek no more than 
enforcement of existing anti-sweatshop provisions and countries' 
own labor laws. No one is trying to shut down faccories, mount 
boycotts, or foment a worker's coup. 


On these limited terms, and with relatively small percentages 
of students involved, the m~vement has met with success ar many 
colleges. Last spring, sir-ins at Georgetown and Duke led the uni-
versities ro promise ro withdraw from a proposed code of conduct 
for apparel manufacture unless it is changed to include disclosure of 
factory locations. The University of Wisconsin at Madison, after a 
97-hour student sir-in, secured a promise for full public disclosure, 
living wages, and reproductive rights for the mostly female swear-
shop workers. Brown and the University of Michigan have agreed 
to disclosure, independent monitoring, and the living wage. 


At Yale, both the tactics and the successes have been more 
modest. Last spring, 1,400 students signed a petition calling for 
independent monitoring, full disclosure, and the living wage. There 
was one action, a "knit-in," with about 30 students attending. Bur 
no results were seen until the week of October 19, when Yale 
Students Against Sweatshops (vSAs) brought Kernaghan and two 
Salvadoran sweatshop workers ro speak and sraged a rally. That 
week the President's Office announced for the first time that they 
would require full disclosure of aJI factory locations where Yale 
apparel is made. Bur rhis decision will bear no fruit for over a year, 
until current licensing agreements are up for renewal. By then, 
many of the organization's current leaders wiU have graduated. 


Why weren't there sir-ins here last spring? "The movement 
wasn't there yet," says Champagne. "The activistS at Yale rend ro be 
really over-analytical. It can be harder to move forward here because 
We have to wait until we've sat down and really thought everything 
through." Senior Saurav Sarkar, another organizer, says, "This issue 
is really a lor of minutiae and legalisms, and in order to organize 
people around that, first you have ro convince them that if they 
NovEMBER 19, 1999 
thought about it they would care about this." A lot of convincing is 
necessary on a topic like sweatshops, which involves complicated 
questions of international economics and is far removed from most 
students' daily experience. This contrasts, for example, with the 
large srudent movemenr in support of Local 34 and 35 strikers four 
years ago. 


Meanwhile, university adminisrracors, industry representatives, 
and even the federal government, either accuse sweatshop activists 
of irresponsibly oversimplifYing the issue or maintain that there is 
no issue. Ann Gust, a Gap executive, was at a master's rea in 
Calhoun last month with her boyfriend, Oakland Mayor Jerry 
Brown, and Champagne asked her why they wouldn't disclose fac-
tory locations. She responded that no one had ever asked them to. 


In July 1998, Jean Sperling, the top economic advisor to President 
Clinton, met with leaders ofusAS ro ask them co stop protesting. In 
order ro address growing concerns, the Fair Labor Association (PLA) 
was formed as a coalition of religious, labor and corporate groups. 
"They wanted co bring us into the process and make us feel good 
about what was going on," Brakken says. Bur the students refused, 
and most of the independent groups had withdrawn support from 
the PLA by November 1998, citing a weak, corporate-enforced code 
of conduct with no living wage or disclosure. Champagne calls it "a 
dummy organization." The FLA then turned to university adminis-
trations. "In February and March of 1999 the srudenr movement 
was starting to pick up and the FLA went behind our backs to ask 
universities to sign on," Brakken says. "This is the biggest rhrear to 
a genuine anti-sweatshop movement." 


As an alternative to the FLA, usAS has helped develop the 
Worker's Rights Consortium (wRc), a group aimed at organizing 
workers to improve the conditions in their own factories. The WRC 
relies on independent monitoring. "This is an alternate system for 
verifYing what's going on, involving workers themselves in the 
process. It's basically a lire-alarm system, a way to respond to worker 
complaints," says Champagne. 


Few would disagree with the need for independent inspection 
of factories to prevent egregious abuses, such as 12-15 hour work-
days, forced overcime, no clean drinking water, no bathroom 
breaks, intimidation and beatings by the factory managers. USAS's 
third demand, that companies pay a living wage rather than the 
country's minimum wage, is much more comroversial. Eva, one of 
the two Salvadoran factory workers who spoke at Yale in October, 
said through an interpreter in her speech, "We make these shirts for 
you with pleasure and we hope that you enjoy wearing them. We 
greatly need these jobs and we don't want to lose them. We just 
want to be treated with decency." Many argue that forcing compa-
nies to pay higher than the lowest wage the market will bear will 
simply cause them to move production elsewhere. Last February 
Th~ Yak Daily N~ws quoted Princeton economist Elizabeth Bogan: 
"I am concerned that if you put a high level of exactness [into the 
living wage code], the multinationals will write these countries
