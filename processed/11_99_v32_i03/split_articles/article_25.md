Â£0FFREY HARTMAN CHAMPIONS com-
plexity in literature. He finds literary 
criticism no less artiStiC than fiction. h 
should come as no surprise, then, to find 
that deciphering Hartman's critical writ-
ings is at times as difficult a task as parsing 
a great poem. Indeed, understanding 
Hartman's works is a kinetic process that 
grows and modifies itself at every step; 
Hartman challenges us to color our obscure 
sense with the brilliance of a critical sub-
lime. Once imbued with the possibility of 
such a pure form of literary truth, any self-
aware reader cannot rest but must instead 
continue to seek out its implications, 
wrestling with knotty insights for their sub-
tle meanings. This is quite a tall order for 
any reader, particularly today. So be it. 

Hartman's criticism is so thoroughly 
informed and erudite that he is not for the 
faint of literary hearc. But for those who 
possess the ambition, Hartman's recently 
published collection of essays, A Critic's 
journey: Liurary &foctions, 1958-I998, pro-
vides a worthy and rewarding portal for 
readers engaging him for the first time, and 
for devotees who have faithfully followed 
his critical output over the years. 

My fust handshake with Hartman's 
work was 
with 
his seminal study, 
Wordsworth's Po~try q87-18I4, a book that 
has permanently changed a generation's 
attitude towards the poet. The tonic 
insights and re-engineered readings of 
stock Wordsworthian tropes, such as his 
famous "spots of time" and the complex 
dialectic between imagination and nature, 
have become the stuff of the new 
Wordsworth critical canon. Wholly con-
vinced by this study, I was naturally drawn 
to his other critical efforts. 

Hartman's 
new 
collection 
affords the opportunity to 
catch up with the master 
through his own selection of 
pivotal essays 
from 
his 
career. 

H artman divides the book into three 
sections: 
"Theory," 
"Cases," 
and 
"Speculations." These follow Hartman's 
reflections on his days as both srudent and 
teacher, a circling back which he calls 
"Polemical Memoir." It is in this "autobio-
graphical self-reflection" that Hartman 
describes his arrival as a Yale graduate stu-
dent in the fall of 1949 after receiving his 
undergraduate 
degree 
Queens 
College in New York. For those who are 
interested in an affectionate, first-hand rec-
ollection of Yale's great literary tradition, 
Hartman's description of studying with 
Erich Auerbach and Rene Wellek proves 
indispensable, and his revealing discussion 
of the influence of these scholars on the 
development of his own critical ethos is 
helpful in locating his intellectual origins. 

Adopting the literary humanism of 
Auerbach, which taught Hartman the value 
of being "probative without preacherly, and 
expansive without ever losing sight of the 
text," and idolizing the mind-boggling 
scholarship ofWellek, Hartman joined the 
Yale teaching faculty in 1955 with an eye 
towards going beyond formalism. Though 
pigeonholed as a deconstructionist due to 
his affiliation with the Yale English depart-
ment in its formative critical years, 
Hartman takes pains to align himself accu-
rately both with respect to his colleagues 
and to the rapidly evolving schools of criti-
........ 9~8-1998 
cism that flour-
ished in his years as 
a Yale professor. "I 
could 
see 
as a 
doctrine ... or 
more 
than a way of expand-
ing the range and depth 
of reading," Hartman remarks, a comment 
which recalls the Auerbachian expansion he 
so valued in his mentor. For Hartman, lit-
erary hermeneutics should never be an 
exercise that thrusts a final evaluation on a 
text; the critic, and by extension the reader, 
must accept the two-fold nature of mean-
ing, deriving satisfaction from the ambigu-
ities in a text. Concurring with Paul de 
Man, one of his colleagues at Yale, 
Hartman writes, "The encounter between 
text and commentary produces difference, 
not closure or a false equilibrium." He is, in 
short, far from one of Harold Bloom's 
"resentniks," who read literature solely 
through a political lens. 

Though Hartman devotes much of his 
introductory piece to clarifying his own 
critical approach, I could not help but be 
swept up by his claims for the role and 
responsibility of criticism in toto: "Literary 
commentary should have its own standing: 
it was not servile but took its place within 
literature, rather than remaining on the 
outside looking in." Such a posture, echo-
ing Matthew Arnold, is later reinforced by 
Hartman's assertion that critics must be 
able to remove the blindness preventing the 
visual epiphany that must accompany tex-
rual appreciation. This piercing-through 
"revives" a "sense of the power of naming." 
and the critic is thus cast as an Adaro 
The NEW JouRNAL 
figure, who ultimately creates the impor-
tance of literature via his "gift of words." 

In the "Theory" section of the book, 
the essay "Understanding Criticism" elabo-
rates the theses of "Polemical Memoir" and 
offers the multiple pleasures ofHartman's 
critical scalpel at work. Here, he continues 
to support his earlier position, and in fact 
aggrandizes criticism to the point where 
"formal critical commentary is not very dif-
ferent from fiction itself." They share a 
"hermeneutic perplexity," and the urge to 
arrive at a meaning, whether in itself (as in 
the case of fiction) or in another work (as in 
the case of commentary). This is a contro-
versial point, and I suspect that Hartman is 
making it as an argument builder rather 
than as something for which he would fall 
on his sword. Even the most soaring criti-
cism is, at best, a reactive genre that lacks 
the 
imaginative 
fuel 
of 
fiction. 
Nonetheless, Hartman's criticism is of the 
highest contemplative merit. His analysis 
of Yeats's "Leda and the Swan" dazzles 
through its demonstration of how the 
rhetorical skill of the poet leads even the 
critic into an uncertain frame of reference, 
perplexed as to how to interpret the poem's 
central image. But it is this very perplexity, 
or "bewildermenr" as Hartman calls it ear-
lier in the piece, that lies at the crux of the 
critical task; the critic must resist any "irri-
table reaching after fact and reason," as 
Keats put it, and thus subside in the 
unrnasterable complexities of the text. Any 
attempt to impose a definite answer 
through which the critic can approximate a 
deeper understanding would end the inter-
pretive enterprise. Hartman possesses a 
critical generosity; the central formulation 
of the essay states, "contemporary criticism 
aims at a hermeneutics of indeterminancy. 
It proposes a type of analysis that has 
renounced the ambition to master or 
demystify its subject." 

In "The Philomela Project," Hartman 
cogently argues for the role criticism plays 
in shaping literary output, where "art does 
not have its axis of influence only in itself. 
a certain type of reading may have con-
tributed to its formation, and certain habits 
of interpretation facilitate its reception." If 
this ragged and often bloody partnership is 
indeed the case, it follows that criticism 
must be aware of its expansive role and thus 
prepare to restore a "voice to inarticulate 
people," those underrepresented individu-

als in cultural history. Why is Hartman so 
intent on giving a voice to "the anony-
mous," particularly when such a project is 
quite visionary and utopian in nature? 
Because out of this mission can emerge a 
criticism that is truer to irs intellectual, his-
torical, and cultural roots. Hartman seeks a 
"reconstruction of the literary-critical 
field," and believes that this restoration can 
best be served by a chorus, if not a cacoph-
ony. "Literature grows from traditions 
rather than tradition, as the ballad collec-
tors knew; and insofar as it helps honor 
such sources, literary criticism is restitu-
tive," concludes Hartman. Rather than 
multiculturalism, Hartman argues for 
multi-criticalism, a plurality of traditions 
rather than a single one. In such a way, lit-
erary criticism can re-envision the text 
through a more multi-prismatic hermeneu-
tical lens. If there is no single answer, as 
Hartman deeply believes, then the more 
voices the better. Indeed, the thrill of 
watching. hearing, and participating in the 
intellectual collisions of these voices is a 
large part of the debt we owe to literature 
itself. 

The "Cases" section of the collection 
offers just what it suggests: examples of 
specific textual circumstances that are scru-
tinized by Hartman's critical eye. "Milton's 
Counterplot," written in 1970, and 
"Wordsworth's Touching Compulsion," 
composed in 1987, are rwo of Hartman's 
well known and precisely keen analyses. In 
these essays, we begin to get a feel for what 
Hartman values in literature, as opposed to 
wading through the strange seas of thought 
that characterize his theoretical musings. 
"Milton's Counterplot" takes up a difficult 
question: How does Milton effectively bal-
ance man's free will with God's foreknowl-
edge? Hartman values Milton's "ghostlier 
demarcations," as Wallace Stevens wrote, 
and thus resists undoing the textual knot of 
ambivalence. We are left, however, with 
Hartman's trenchant interpretation of 
many key similes and tropes, and with 
Hartman's reverence for Milton's calm 
authorial control over the supernatural 
events of the poem. 

Indeed, "Cases" contains essays that 
reveal what Hartman values most in litera-
ture, judgments that are related to a theo-
retical backdrop but that are also largely the 
product of personal preference. This is 
where we get into the mind of a great eric-
ic, and begin to see his critical faculty in 
action. Nowhere is this more prominently 
figured than in Hartman's discussion of 
Wordsworth. In "Wordsworth's Touching 
Compulsion," Hartman is concerned with 
the "loss of an earlier relation, or of the pri-
mary love object (the mother, 'heaven')" 
which "is not easily compensated." He 
envisions much of Wordsworth's poetry as 
striving to replace the lost mother-object 
with Narure as a substitute love-object. 
Touch becomes a transcendent force in the 
poems, liberating Wordsworth from the 
tyranny of the eye and bringing him closer 
to the "one dear Presence" which is the 
"object of Wordsworth's nature poems." 
This quest for a presence that transcends 
representation is an important aspect of 
Wordsworch's poetry, and one which 
Hartman greatly admires. For it is in this 
emphasis on crystallizing absences through 
symbolic representation, rather than bring-
ing them into the poetry in the form of 
"gothic, ghostly, or surrealist fantasies, or 
animated spectres," where Wordsworth 
affirms 
greatest poetical 
power. 

Hartman writes, "under the words are 
ghostlier words, half-perceived figures or 
fragments that seem to be at once part of 
the lost object and more living than what is 
present." Keep the absent absent, Hartman 
is saying, and poetry then transcends its 
own language: we are swept up by the mys-
tery of what lies beneath and muse on the 
limits of the visionary expanse. 

A Critic's ]ou~ unites the various 
concerns, theories, and preoccupations of a 
literary life in one convenient location. We 
can join Hartman on his journey at our 
leisure, but we will invariably return out of 
breath, bewildered, and in need of 
reflection. Hartman describes the function 
of the critic in terms that reflect the 
difficulty of the literary excursion ahead of 
us: "The critic, then, is one who makes us 
formally aware of the bewildering character 
of fiction. Books are our second Fall, the 
reenactment of a seduction that is also a 
corning to knowledge. The innermost hope 
they inspire may be the one Henirich von 
Kleist expressed: 'onJy by caring a second 
time of the tree of knowledge will we regain 
paradise.'" Geoffrey Hartman, as such a lit-
erary critic, is another Adam for our gener-
ation.
