influence people," she says. "We're not really interested in putting ourselves out as leaders of the movement. We're more interested in helping individuals arfd providing links for people to other groups and information, whether that's weight-discrimination resources, finding an attorney, finding information for their kid." Personal responses to the Stimsons in the form of daily letters and emails, often from high school, college and graduate students, show that the information does indeed reach and affect people. Karen also has observed broader changes in American attitudes toward size rights during her career. 
"There's been a real evolution in public perception about people of size and I think the size-rights movement has been largely responsible for that. In some ways we've made a lot of strides ahead. We've got a long way to go," she said. 
But isn't being fat unhealthy? "You have to be careful about what I call the medical propaganda wing of the diet industry," Karen warns. According to her, medical standards for healthy body weights have been revised downward while people have been getting taller, and ·these factors combined tend to skew statistics. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this can account for the dramatic increases in weight shown in recent reports. The Centers for Disease Control reponed that 17.8 percent of Americans were considered obese in 1998, up from 12 percent in 1991. 
Although New Haven activists have helped to promote the size-rights movement, size-rights activism has largely died our here. "New Haven doesn't have an active size-rights group at this point and hasn't for a while," says Karen. The closest NAAFA chapter, located in Milford, has little effect on the New Haven community. So while New Haven, specifically Largesse, remains the home of extensive archives documenting the emergence of the size-rights movement, its residents must cultivate size . esteem on their own. The Stimsons, meanwhile, will continue to make their archives available over the net, hoping, as Richard says in his "Invocation for the . Size Rights Movement," to "· .. plant in the hearts and I minds I Of every child, woman, and man I The seeds of size diversity I empowerment."
