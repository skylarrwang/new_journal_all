"Within each man there are many 
men or, perhaps, two men." 
- Borges, speaking at Yale, April 7• 1971 

HAD NOT JORGE LUIS BORGES DIED IN 1986, Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges 
would have been 100 years old this year. In honor of the cen-
tennial of his birth, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes gave a lecture in 
October at New York City's 92nd Street Y entitled "Jorge Luis 
Borges at 100." At Yale University, Borges is being remembered 
throughout the fall semester by a lecture series, "Borges at Yale." 
Both the Fuentes lecture and the Yale series remember Borges just 
as one might expect them to, celebrating his literary achievements. 
But less than thirty years ago, Borges was not so universally 
acclaimed. He visited both New Haven and New York in 1971. 
While Yale honored him then as it does now, his reception days earlier 
at New York's Columbia University was hostile. The crowd that 
came to hear Borges speak at Yale came to honor a famous author. 
Certainly many in attendance at Columbia came to do the same, 
but others came with a different agenda entirely: to attack him for 
being a conservative, for not being active in politics-in short, for 
not sharing their own political views. 

The student body of Columbia was volatile in the early 1970s, 
and we might easily dismiss the protesters had Borges not criticized 
himself on the same grounds: 
I was always very nearsighted and wore glasses, and I was rather frail. 
Almost of my people had been soldiers--even my father's brother had 
been a naval officer-and I knew I never would be. I felt ashamed, 
quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action. 
Throughout my boyhood, I thought that to be loved would have 
amounted to an injustice. I did not feel I deserved any particular love. 

Borges feared that love was an emotion reserved for men of action, 
for men who took part in the affairs of the world rather than hiding 
in the worlds of fictions. Anticipating his critics at Columbia, 
he questioned his dedication to scholarship in lieu of action. 
Surely no one today would have encouraged Borges to read or 
write less: love of the author and his erudite fictions is what brings 
audiences to memorial lectures in 1999. So what happened to his 
attackers? What happened to the people who saw him as a man who 
succeeded in changing Latin American literature, but who failed in 
changing Latin American politics? 

An unlikely clue lies in the September 27, 1999, Yale Bulletin, 
in the headline announcing the Borges lecture series: "Fall Lecture 
Series commemorates Brazilian writer Jorge Luis Borges." Getting 
Borges's home country (and thereby his native tongue) wrong is a 
gaffe, but perhaps a significant one. What is remembered now is 
more his art than his nationality. It is as if Borges had in fact been 
two men, one a scholarly man and the other a scholarly writer. 
Indeed, in one of his most famous-and famously brief-stories, 
"Borges and I," he himself acknowledges the duality of his exis-
tence, identifying the two people within him: Borges the man and 
Borges the author. The person remembered in 1999, as the celebra-
tions in New York and New Haven suggest, is Borges the author, 
not Borges the man. But when and how did one disappear into the 
other? 

IN 1971, BORGES TRAVELLED TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY to receive 
an honorary doctorate and to take part in a conference entitled 
"Society and the Arts in Latin America." Almost instantly, he ignited 
the anger of his audience by using the inflammatory word "con-
servative." "Truly great artists," The Village Voice reported Borges as 
saying, "have concerned themselves with the past-
Homer, for 
instance, sang of a war that took place long before his lifetime." In 
that sense, Borges said, he could be called a "conservative." 

Nicanor Parra, a Chilean poet in attendance, was appalled at 
the use of that taboo word and began an attack on Borges that was 
to last for the remainder of the day: 
I was deeply disturbed to hear ... Borges say that he is a conserva-
tive ... the very word is an obscenity. As a poet and lover of words, I 
have been waiting all morning to hear the most beautiful word in the 
hemisphere ... The word is 'revolution.' 

Parra's attack was not just a quibble with Borges's use of the 
word "conservative"-to him it was ridiculous that Borges was 
more concerned with the Trojan War than current political issues. 
Borges, however, was unfazed by Parra's opening salvo, dismissing 
his impassioned words with the remark, "Forgive me; I know noth-
ing of all that." But for Parra and those of the same mind, it was 
precisely the truth of this dismissal that angered them. Preparing 
Village Voice reporter Anna Mayo to interview Borges during his visit to 
New York, Norman di Giovanni, Borges's personal assistant and 
translator, requested that she refrain from asking questions about 
politics: "It is really better if you keep off politics. Borges is totally 
apolitical. He hasn't read a newspaper in years. He didn't even read 
them when he could see." To prove his point, di Giovanni cited an 
incident that occurred at a reading Borges gave at Harvard. A student 
asked him what he thought about "the war." Borges did not 
know which war the student was talking about. When he was told 
that the student referred to the Vietnam War, he responded that 
since it was American and approved by the President, it was most 
likely just and honorable. The business of explaining his unpopular 
stance then fell to di Giovanni: "For Borges this country still has 
mythic proportions, it's still the land of Emerson and Walt 
Whitman. [It is] impossible to explain to him that that America no 
longer exists. The best I've been able to do is to convince him that 
he doesn't know anything about politics." 


Parra clearly agreed, and he was not alone. A Cuban man con-
tinued Parra's line of attack, but with none of the Chilean poet's rev-
erence, demanding of Borges: "Why is it that you are never 
seized to write about the masses? Why don't you write 
about us? Eh, Borges? Why not us?" Borges 
responded: "And why, why on earth should I 
write about you?" The Cuban retorted, 
"Because we exist!" Borges was not impressed 
with the Cuban's reasoning: "But my dear 
fellow, is that your only argument? Consider 
Shakespeare and Rudyard Kipling. They too 
exist! And I think and write on them." 

This answer did not sit well with the 
protestors in the Columbia crowd: Borges's 
comment only served to affirm their belief 
that he was a conservative. That he cited 
two English authors, one of whom had 
written so favorably about colonization, 
surely did not escape their notice. The 
result was a melee, with angry protesters 
heckling Borges. Emir Monegal, a biographer 
of Borges who was present at the Columbia 
conference, recalls a student so enraged with 
him that he insulted the author's mother. Borges, 
who lived with his mother until her death, stood 
up, his cane shaking in his hand, and challenged the 
young man to a duel. Di Giovanni fought through the 
crowd in an attempt to protect Borges while Columbia 
faculty members attempted to put an end to the event. It 
was Borges, though, who closed the proceedings. Before he would 
allow the crowd to disperse for lunch, he demanded to respond to 
his attackers: 

I believe in revolution, and I am waiting for it to come. In the revolu-
tion there will be no political leaders. There will be no propaganda and 
there will be no banners [rags]. When they tell of some new revolu-
tion I always ask 'and do they have a rag?' and when they say 'yes,' I 
know it is not my revolution. 

The echo of the day's unrest continued to ring, but his words had 
silenced the crowd. Borges, it seemed, was more complex than his 
opponents had thought. 

JORGE LUIS BORGES WAS BORN in Buenos Aires in 1899. When 
writing about himself, Borges indulges in his family mytholo-
gy, recounting stories of his ancestors' European lineage and their 
contributions to the military history of Argentina. Before Borges or 
even his parents appear in his "Autobiographical Essay," Colonel 
Borges, the writer's grandfather, rides toward the enemy, where he 
is killed by two Remington bullets. Only after placing this event in 
its historical context-"This was the first time Remington rifles 
were used in the Argentine"-does Borges turn to the business of 
writing about himself. 

His pride in his family, particularly in their European ancestry, 
did not always serve him well. The first battlefield was his elemen-
tary school. The school he attended was called the Thames School, 
named for an Argentine general, not the English river. Nevertheless, 
Borges's father sent his son to school in the traditional uniform of 
English schoolboys, earning the already erudite Borges no points 
with his less sophisticated classmates: "As I wore spectacles and 
dressed in an Eton collar and tie, I was jeered at and bullied by most 
of my schoolmates, who were amateur hooligans." Borges was 
attacked for his apparent conservatism and his bookishness 
the moment he entered public life. 

But he was not always apolitical and conservative. 
In 1937, his father, whose eyesight had failed him years 
before, began to have heart trouble. Borges got a job--
at age 38, his first full-time employment-at a library. 
While Borges was descending the stairs to the 
library's basement to read the likes of Bernard Shaw 
and Gibbon, Juan Domingo Perón was rising to the 
top of the Argentine government. Notoriously 
ruthless, Perón's regime murdered its 
opponents in its efforts to gain and 
maintain power, the death toll periodi-
cally growing as new mass graves of 
Perón's victims are discovered. 

Though he was holed up working 
and reading in the library, Borges was any-
thing but silent about Perón's rise to power. By 
the 1930s, Borges had already established himself 
as an important writer in Argentina, publishing 
regularly in several publications. Borges used his sec-
tion in the periodical EL Hogar to criticize Nazis in 
Europe and their sympathizers in Argentina. In his 
invectives against the Argentine regime, Borges sounds 
less like a poet and more like a political pundit. 

Perón took power in Argentina in February of 1946 and 
by August of that year he had also taken notice of Borges's public 
criticisms. In August, Borges was officially informed that he had 
been promoted from his position at the library to the inspectorship 
of poultry and rabbits in the market on Córdoba Street. He imme-
diately resigned from his new position. Perón's "promotion" of 
Borges was perhaps even more humiliating than Borges lets on. 
Monegal notes that, "To promote one of the leading Argentine 
intellectuals to inspector of chickens and rabbits implied a linguis-
tic pun. Chickens and rabbits are in Spanish ... synonymous with 
cowardice." In Borges's estimation, Perón did not understand the 
power of language. Borges, however, did; in making a public state-
ment after his resignation, his words were as potent as Perón's word-
play was snide: 

Dictatorships foment oppression, dictatorships foment subservience, 
dictatorships foment cruelty; even more abominable is the fact that 
they foment stupidity [with their] buttons which babble slogans, 
images of leaders ... To fight against those sad monotonies is one of the 
many duties of writers. 

During the Perón years, Borges performed this duty-to a cer-
tain degree. His denunciation of Perón proves, as his final speech at 
Columbia intimated, that he was not always apolitical; it does not, 
however, indicate a commitment to political action. Borges hated 
Perón, at least in part, because he incorrectly considered him not 
merely a fascist, but a Nazi as well. Borges blamed the Nazis for 
destroying the German culture that had produced one of his heroes, 
philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. But he would later accept a prize 
from Pinochet's Chile, a regime as fond of making enemies disap-
pear as was Perón's. Borges's detractors at Columbia were certainly
