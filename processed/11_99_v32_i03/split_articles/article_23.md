oven.ealous in their attacks on Borges, but 
their criticisms were not completely off the 
mark. 


N 1961, BoRGES, along with Samuel 
Beckett, was awarded the Formentor 
Prize, earning him worldwide recognition. 
This recognition allowed him to tour the 
United States in the early 1970s, the trip 
funded by the literary awards he received 
along the way. His visit ro Columbia was 
such a trip. It was there that Monegal, then 
the chair of Yale's Spanish and Portuguese 
department, asked Borges to speak at Yale. 
On the day of the visit, a small invita-
tion was offered to the Yale community in 
the Yak Daily Nnus, in a paragraph easily 
obscured by the thumb used to hold the 
paper open to page three. The message 
read, "Jorge Luis Borges will participate in 
a panel discussion in Room 102, Linsley-
Chiuenden Hall tonight at 7:30." Above 
the notice regarding Borges's visit, a similar 
notification, 
three 
times 
as 
long, 
announced a lecture entitled "Choosing 
Teachers for Inner City Schools," to be 
delivered by Chester Preyar, an administra-
tor for the Cincinnati Public School 
System. 

More publicity was not necessary. 
Room 102 had approximately 200 sears. 
When Borges arrived with his host 
Monegal, 500 people had already managed 
to fit into the lecrure hall. There was no 
room for Borges. Monegal was surprised 
but unfazed: "We decided to search for a 
larger room. Headed by Borges, a proces-
sion formed slowly and traversed the Yale 
campus." The image Monegal conjures of 
the blind Borges leading a vast group of fol-
lowers across Yale is infused with the same 
sort of magic that moves Borges's fictions. 
A Yale University Police Officer, however, 
didn't see the magic of the roving crowd. 
Roberto Gonz.alez Echevarda, current head 
of Yale's Spanish department, remembers 
the officer stopping them and demanding 
to know what the demonstration was 
against. Given the events at Columbia only 
weeks before, the question was mordantly 
ironic: the crowd was not demonstrating-
it was venerating a literary hero. As 
Monegal recalls, "We were so obviously 
men of peace that the police let us contin-
ue our search." 

The search was successful: Strathcona 
Hall, one of the largest on campus, was 
free. The evening with Borges was no less 
successful, as Monegal fondly recalls: 
Borges began by answering. with the 
subtlest irony, questions put forth by 
writers and critics. That won them 
completely. He is one of us, they fdt. 
When the Aoor was opened to quesÂ· 
tions, people rushed to ask him about 
everything that passed through their 
minds. Borges answered with humor 
and simplicity, never talking down to 
them, always comic and gentle. 

Borges's experience at Yale could not 
have been more different from his experi-
ence at Columbia. Monegal had feared 
otherwise, and was both overjoyed and 
relieved: "Borges could not see his listeners, 
but he sensed that a rapport existed 
between him and them; and because he 
knew it. .. he was serene while all of us, who 
could see, were afraid. He trusted his audi-
ence, and it in turn loved him." Echevarria 
states unequivocally, "He was celebrated." 


JGHTEE.N NlNBTY-NINE, as they say in 
the wine business, was a good year. 
Novelist Vladimir Nabokov was born in 
1899, as was poet Hart Crane. Borges, too, 
was born on the cusp of the century, a cen-
tury whose literature he, Nabokov and 
Crane would immeasurably change. 

Borges was a precocious reader, begin-
ning his life of letters at age four. His father 
was an intellectual, an avid reader and an 
Anglophile. Borges inherited his father's 
love of reading and in particular of English 
literature just as he had inherited what 
would eventually keep him from it, his 
blindness. His father's vast library fed 
Borges's intellect. Borges once wrote, "If I 
were asked to name the chief event of roy 
life, I should say my father's library." 

Given his eventual contributions to 
Larin American literature, it is strange to 
peruse the names of the authors Borges 
read as a child, the authors who would per-
manently shape him as a writer. An early 
poetic love was not Lope de Vega but rather 
Edgar Allen Poe; the first novel he ever read 
was nor Don Qui.xou but Hucltkbnry Finn. 
The young Borges did indeed read 
Cervantes, but in English translation and 
this early reading experience was burned 
into the labyrinthine coils of his mind. He 
once wrote, "When I later read Don 
Qui:Jwu in the original, it sounded like a 
bad translation to me." Raised on a diet of 
G.K. Chesterton, H.G. Wells, and 
Jonathan Edwards, Borges never really 
developed a taste for Spanish: "As an 
Argentine writer," he once said, "I have to 
cope with Spanish and so am only too 
aware of its shortcomings." 

The reader of his prose, however, is 
never aware of these shortcomings. Borges 
never wrote a novel-he never wanted to. 
He was a master of the short story. Calling 
American attention to the Argentine 
author in an article entitled "The Author as 
Librarian," John Updike writes of Borges's 
prose: "His driest paragraph is somehow 
compelling. His fables are wrirten from a 
lvight of intelligence less rare in philoso-
phy and physics than in fiction ... For all his 
modesty of tone, he proposes some sort of 
essential revision in literature itself." 

Protestors at Columbia in 1971 disdained 
Borges because he did not use the word 
"revolution." What they didn't see is that 
rhe way in which Borges manipulates 
words is revolutionary. 

Perhaps they didn't see it because a 
Borges story is just as likely to take place in 
a labyrinth as it is in Argentina, just as like-
ly to inhabit an imaginary library as 
Buenos Aires. Even Updike, writing in 
1965, noted the exclusivity of Borges's 
fictions: "His ideas border on delusions; 
the dark hints ... that he so studiously devel-
ops are special to the corrupt light of 
libraries and might vanish, one fears, our-
doors." Delivering his lecture at the 92nd 
Street Y in October, Carlos Fuentes, how-
ever, proposed a new way of interpreting 
Borges's dark hints: "By giving a leading 
role to the mirror and the labyrinth, the 
book and the garden, time and space, 
[Borges) redefined what is real through lit-
erary and imaginary traditions." In this 
way, he argued, Borges liberated his work 
from the European tradition. Fuentes, who 
was himself influenced by Borges's work, 
has also wimessed the effects of Borges's 
fiction on Latin American literature. 

Fuentes argues that Borges's literature was 
the first writing that seemed to be cruly 
Latin American. Rather than reconstruct-
ing a vanished past, Borges's fictions are all-
inclusive, and demonstrate a literary imag-
ination that is open to all cultures. At the 
same rime these fictions are consummately 
Latin American, and in 
particular, 
Argentine, representing a culture that is the 
synthesis of both disparate European and 
native elements. 

THE NEW JouRNAL 


**Title: Borges and I**
**Page number(s): 41**

N "BoRGES AND I," BoRGES THE. MAN, 
the man anacked'at Columbia in 1971, 
struggles with Borges the author, the 
author celebrated at Yale just weeks later: 
Ir is Borges, the other one, tha,s things 
happen to ... Ir would be an e&ggera-
tion to say that our relationship is hos-
tile--! live, I allow m}'Klf to live, so 
that Borges can spin out his literature, 
and that literarure is my justification. I 
willingly admit that he has written some 
sound pages, but those pages will not 
save m~. 

A century after the man was born, as 
Borges predicted, only the author still 
exists: the memory of the sometime conser-
vative, apolitical Borges is almost extin-
guished-it is Borges the author we cele-
brate. 

But perhaps Borges the author did 
more for Borges the man than he is willing 
to admit. During his life Borges created 
fictions that earned him the love of a world 
of readers. In one of his essays, Borges 
offers an all but parenthetical comment 
that might be the pinnacle of a lesser 
writer's 
o~uvr~. remarking nonchalantly 
that "to fall in love is to create a religion 
that has a fallible god." Borges the man was 
f.ill.ible, and his politics were not always 
admirable, but today it has cost him few 
adherents to the religion ofloving his work. 
His art rose above politics, the world of 
banderas and empty symbols. His fictions 
helped to bring worldwide attention to the 
literature of Argentina and all of Latin 
America and, more importantly, helped to 
shape those literatures. 

As a child, Borges did not believe that 
he deserved the love of his family-he was 
a thinker, not a man of action. Bur perhaps 
in the act of writing, Borges ultimately 
found love. At least that is one way of read-
ing his response to the last question asked 
of him at Yale in 1971, a question perhaps at 
once the most simple and the most com-
plex of the evening. "Have you ever been in 
love?" a student asked. Borges's one-word 
response: 
"Yes."
