S 
cenes from the coming revolution: #I. On September 23, 
1999, loyal viewers of Live With Regis and Kathie Lee were 
treated to a spectacle more dramatic than the usual coffee-
klatSch banrer. According to The New l'Ork Daily News "during an 
impassioned IS-minute monologue" Kathie Lee Gifford "cast herself 
as a lone celebrity voice against swearshops and demanded that 
labor advocates stop picking on her. 'I get so fed up with these 
vicious personal attacks against my integrity and my character,' she 
says." Among Gifford's named vicious attackers? United Students 
Against Swearshops, an organization which counts Yale junior 
Jessica Champagne among irs leaders. 

Scene #2. On a Tuesday night in October, about JOO studentS 
gathered in the Law School Auditorium. A six-foot-tall man with a 
paunch and steel-gray hair slicked back into a ponytail stepped up 
to the podium: it was Charles Kernaghan, the man who, with his 
National Labor Committee, had forever tarnished the name of 
Gifford's Wal-Mart clothing line in 1996 with his sweatShop expose. 
He reeled off faces about the minimum wage in El Salvador, which 
a Princeton study has found meets only 28 percent of the cost of liv-

the retail price of a Yale T-shirr. Kernaghan was there not just to 
preach to the converted, but to praise them; he called USAS "the 
strongest human and labor righrs movement in the country today." 

This could be dismissed as a typical lobbyist's hyperbolic sound 
bite. Yet the sudden emergence of the sweatshop issue into both 
Yale's and the nation's conscience does demand explanation. There 
has been a radical shift in the nature and purpose of student 
activism all over the country since the iconic days of the I960s, and 
the rate of the movement has accelerated in just the last few years. 
The anti-sweatshop movement, with irs national media attention, 
small-scale actions and successes, exemplifies this trend. 

DISPARAGE R.EEBOK, read the T-shirrs in 1995. The University of 
Wisconsin at Madison had just signed a contract with Reebok for 
athletic apparel, which stipulated that no one connected with the 
university would be allowed to "disparage" the company-by ques-
tioning irs manufacturing conditions, for example. The first anti-
sweatShop rallies on college campuses began at Wisconsin. Socially 
concerned student leaders had found not just an issue to rally
