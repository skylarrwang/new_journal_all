reading 
"Layeth the Smacketh Down! [and on the back] On 
Your CANDYASS!" does seem titillating, it pales in comparison to the 
adventure of owning a piece of the action. When the WWF hit the 
Nasdaq on October 19 with an initial public offering of S17 per 
share, the Big Boss Men of American venture capital rumbled for 
6nancial supremacy: by the afternoon, shares were going for S35· 
But here in our sleepy little hollow, this Wall Street chicanery 
hardly turned any heads (when did you last see Peter Lynch on pay-
per-view?). At the Coliseum on October 31, no one was calking 
about business: it was all about the smackdown. The place was filled 
almost to capacity with a motley assortment of fans-as if a torna-
do had slammed a trailer park into downtown New Haven. 

The woman next to me weighed nearly 300 pounds (or about 
as much as Sexual Chocolate Mark Henry). She had at least four 
kids with her, which meant she'd shelled out over SIOO for tickets 
(and which also meant that if she'd invested the money in WWP 
stock two weeks ago, the profits would have paid for the whole 
show}. While I was ogling the numerous cigarette burns that dap-
pled her arms, the arena got dark and a guy in a tuxedo stepped into 
the spotlight. He thanked all the sponsors graciously, and men-
tioned some of the mountain of memorabilia for sale at the conces-
sion stands. Some fans a few rows back shouted, "I want to toss 
your salad," which a nearby spectator told me had something to do 
with anal play. By the end of his pitiful pitch, the whole crowd was 
shouting, "Ass ... hole! Ass ... hole!" 

Then The Godfather came on the scene. He was dressed in fur 
and dripping with gold jewelry. In his hand, he held a cane-which 
really makes you wonder what he was doing wrestling-and on his 
arm, three lovely ladies. He rook the mike from the suit, and 
growled, "Is there any pimps in this house?" Apparently, there was 
many pimps in that house, because everyone cheered. To which The 
Godfather repHed, "Roll up a fatty I for this big daddy!" Wild 
applause. The guy behind me confided to his girlfriend: "Pimpin' 
sure ain't easy." 

The Godfather was ruling the roost until who should appear 
but Midian, a giant of a man wearing nothing bur a custom pair of 
bikini underwear. Midian was apparently intent on making time 
with The Godfather's women. He cleared his throat and belted, 
"You don't know how to treat these hos. If they 
was mine, they'd be on they knees blessin' me." 
No one in the audience seemed to agree. 
"Ass ... hole! Ass ... hole!" 
The stage was set: it was time to fight. They 
danced around the ring a little, jabbing and occa-
sionally throwing each other. This was all sort of 
boring. actually. Neither offered any defense, 
and neither showed any skills che other didn't 
have. But in the end, Midian got pinned. He 
shuffled out of the ring quickly, with his rail 
between his legs; meanwhile, The Godfather had some tail of his 
own between his legs. With a Little funk music playing, he proceed-
ed to parry suggestively with his three prostitutes. Soon, however, 
this triumfeminare, apparently a lirtle bored with their pimp, saun-
tered over ro the referee (!) and started dry-humping him. 

It went on like this, one homo-erotic march after another-an 
eight-man rag-ream challenge, rhe European Championship 
between British Bulldog and Test, a g,rudgematch between Kane 
and X-pac. Until it was time for che Intercontinental 
Championship, between champion Chyna (a woman!} and chal-
lenger Y2J Chris Jericho. Y2.J spent a a few minutes absolutely kick-
ing Chyna's ass, which was a little scary, considering the cigarette-
burned woman next to me. In the end, Chyna pinned him after a 
brutal reverse. 

The ruxedo guy then announced that Bob Backlund_, WWF 
wrescler-rurned congressional candidate, was soliciting campaign 
contributions in return for autographs in the lobby. There, I found 
a bright-eyed man in a T-shirt-tuxedo with a red bow-tie and red 
suspenders. What's your platform? "Get government out of rhe life 
of the American people." Okay ... how? "Get rid of the IRS." What's 
your take on the proliferation of pro-wrestlers in government roday? 
"Look, you're better off with a wrestler representing you than an 
attorney." I had to agree, but no, I didn't care ro make a concribu-
oon. 

Back in the ring, The Rock was raking on HHH for the 
Championship, which is more important than the Intercontinental 
and the European combined. The Rock won after HHH was dis-
qualified on a technicaliry (who says wrestlers are better than 
lawyers?). The audience practically stormed the ring. looking for an 
autograph. And when The Rock went to the showers, everyone 
wenr to the parking lot ro wait for his car, which they would have 
mobbed had the police not sealed off the area. Even the kid whose 
"666" shirt testified to his familiariry with let-downs seemed a little 
let down. 

Whar's the big deal? you ask. Isn't it all fake? Let me refer that 
question to your Congressman.
