That's why he entered the office of 
Senator Joseph Lieberman on July 2.. For 
nearly two years, every first Friday of the 
month, Colville and others had held a vigil 
outside Lieberman's office. They had writ-
ten letters and sat in the waiti!'g room of 
his office numerous times with no 
response. By July 2., Colville and the others 
believed that the situation in Iraq had gone 
from bad to worse and that the "imminent 
harm" to Iraqis posed by continued sanc-
tions and bombings had to be stopped. 
They went to the waiting area, then tried 
the door leading to the private offices, 
which for some reason had been left 
unlocked. They then knelt down in the 
hallway just inside the door, praying, read-
ing from their leaflet, and ringing a bell 
every 12. minutes to toll the death of an 
Iraqi child. 


Colville had been hearing horror sto-
ries about conditions in Iraq ever since che 
beginning of the Gulf War, when the 
United States and the United Nations first 
imposed sanctions. The sanctions were 
geared toward deposing Saddam Hussein 
and diminishing Iraqi capacity to produce 
weapons of mass destruction, but nine 
years later, neither goal has been accom-
plished. The United States and the United 
Nations continue to deny the.lraqi people 
food, medicine, and monetary aid. Colville 
claims the sanctions have direcrly caused 
the deaths of half a million Iraq is-without 
food and medicine they cannot live and 
without monetary aid they cannot rebuild 
their bombed-out sewage, water treatment, 
and electric plants. 


Colville's 
complaints 
against 
Lieberman include specific attacks on his 
pro-defense, pro-sanction, and pro-bomb-
ing stance. Lieberman, Colville claims, has 
not only given vocal support to continued 
bombings and sanctions in Iraq, but also 
recendy signed a letter to the President call-
ing for stricter sanctions and more frequent 
bombings. Ironically, at the same time 
Lieberman has advocated war in Iraq and 
the build-up of Connecticut's defense 
industry, he has taken a public stand 
against violence in the media-<:onnecting 
movies like Scr~am with the shootings at 
Columbine High School. For Colville, 
opposition to violence in one arena cannot 
logically coexist with support for violence 
in another. One of his purposes in entering 
Lieberman's office was "to demand that 
Senator Lieberman find his conscience 
with regard to the death of children outside 
this country ... and that he acknowledge the 
hypocrisy in opposing media violence 
while supporting the real violence of sanc-
tions in Iraq." 


Back in the same Hartford courtroom 
where he had taken the stand to espouse his 
beliefs and watched the jury convict him in 
half an hour, Colville calmly refused to sign 
an agreement with the judge not to commit 
further crimes. "If we srop resisting," he 
explained to me four days earlier, "it means 
we've stopped making connections, or 
acknowledging that they exist. Iraq is the 
war du jour. When they stop the sanctions, 
we don't just fold up our signs and go 
home." 


With three of their loudest critics 
firmly 
locked 
away, 
Lieberman, 
Connecticut, and the federal government 
can breathe a collective sigh of relief. It 
postpones the inevitable--a good hard 
look at a defense industry whose value to 
national, state, and human interests has 
become increasingly difficult to defend. To 
many, Colville's views seem radical, his 
methods unlikely to effect change. But 
recenrly his warnings of doom have begun 
to penetrate the consciences of even 
Connecticut's typically pro-defense con-
gressmen. Two weeks ago, Malone, a 
defense moderate, and New Haven's 
Representative Rosa Delauro, a strong 
force behind continued defense allocations 
to Sikorsky, introduced to Congress the 
Food and Medicine for the World Act, 
which would lift u.s. unilateral sanctions 
on Iraq. For Colville, caught between the 
law of his God and the law of his land, the 
issue has become survival--one he intends 
to pursue regardless of the likelihood of 
actually 
affecting 
public 
policy. 


"Connecticut is a real dump," he told me 
wistfully before being remanded to cus-
tody. "I love living here."
