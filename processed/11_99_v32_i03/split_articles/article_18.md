Sub·Contract Killers,
Branford students will be reunited with their college next year. 
Will union workers return to their jobs? 
by Alexander Dworkowitz 
FoR THE PAST FEW WEEKS, a group of 20 Branford students has met 
to discuss the future of the renovated Branford College. The group's 
goal is clear: to do everything it can to insure that members of Yale's 
custodial union, Local 35, return to maintain the renovated college 
next fall instead of allowing subcontracted employees of the Fusco 
Corporation to work there. According to member Adam Gordon, 
the Branford students opposes Fusco's work on four grounds: 
wages, working conditions, benefirs and the right to collective bar-
gaining. 

Most of these studenrs are stuck with the alternative this year. 
The Fusco Corporation, a nation-wide development company, 
finished construction of Swing Space in 1998, and now continues co 
maintain it. 

Swing Space is not Fusco's first job on campus. According to 
Joe Mullinix, Yale's Vice-President for Finance and Administration, 
Fusco worked on the renovation of Yale Field, the construction of 
the Harris building at the medical school, and the annex to Payne 
Whitney Gymnasium. Currendy, Fusco maintains both Swing 
Space and the renovated Linsley-Chittenden. Fusco is also being 
considered for other contracrs, including the renovation ofTimothy 
Dwight College. 

Members of the Yale administration say they have been happy 
not only with the quality of Fusco's work but also with its commit-
ment to New Haven. Kernel Dawkins, Vice-President of Facilities, 
said in a January issue of the Yak Daily News, "The Fusco 
Corporation is a highly regarded New Haven-based firm. Yale likes 
to do business with firms that have conuibuted to the New Haven 
community." 

Dawkins, however, expressed his confidence in Fusco before 
questions of wrongdoing emerged this July. In a series of press con-
ferences, Jim Newton, mayoral candidate and critic of Fusco's sroo-
million contract to build the Long Wharf Mall, divulged details 
about Fusco's history. In 1987, the city lent Fusco s6.9 million for a 
consuuction project. By 1995, Fusco completed the project but had 
yet to begin loan paymentS. Due to a fault in the original contract, 
however, the ciry had little means to make Fusco pay. The city bar-
gained. Fusco paid back $3.5 million of the loan on the spot and 
kept the remaining $3.4 million of raxpayer money. Four years and 
one mall contract later, Newton alleges that Fusco returned a frac-
tion of the money to DeStefano in the form of a $4,500 campaign 
conuibution. 

Newcon also revealed that Long Wharf is not Fusco's first mall 
project. After years of managing a Florida mall, competition drove 
out tenants. However, Fusco could not close the unprofitable mall 
because Peter Barak, a dentist, refused to move out. In response, 
Fusco severely cut back on its spending, neglecting upkeep and, 
according tO Barak, violating his lease. He sued Fusco, and the case 
is still in court. 

"These people play hardball," says Barak. "They basically dis-
honored everything in the lease. They are very shrewd businessmen, 
and there is a fine line between being shrewd and being unethical." 

These emerging facts, however, have not affected Yale's rela-
tionship with Fusco. "If you only dealt with contractors who never 
had any financial problems, you'd be severely limiting yourself," says 
Mullinix. Mullinix affirmed that once the facts of Fusco's history 
became public, no one in his department suggested rethinking 
Yale's relationship wirh Fusco. "No one came to me and said, 'Gee, 
these people are morally deficienr.' There is no evidence of any kind 
of wrongdoing. I think the Fuscos are very honorable, and I uust 
them." 

Although he would not disclose the names of the companies, 
Dawkins says that Yale has in the past ended contracts with partic-
ular firms because they did not meet Yale's standards. Says Dawkins, 
"We always reserve the right to suspend contracts, and we often do 
that. I believe that we have very high standards." 

Dawkins says these standards focus on performance, meaning 
both the quality of work provided and the state of the companies' 
finances. He does admit, though, that there are criteria for hiring 
companies that extend beyond performance. "If a company was 
found to have a continued background of fraudulence, we would 
review their contract." 

The group of Branford students, though, is not concerned with 
Fusco's history. Instead, they are protesting the subcontracting of 
jobs that have belonged to Yale's Local 35 for decades. "The main 
problem," says Laurie Kennington, one of the founders of the 
group. "is that these are not Yale jobs." 

The stOry of Local 35 dates back to 1993, when Richard Levin 
became pres idem and Dawkins a part of his administration. Levin 
and the n~v administration decided to investigate ways to improve 
the university's infrastrucurure. Thus, the deferred maintenance 
policy came to an end, and renovation of campus buildings and the

confrontation between Yale and Local 35 began. Yale wanted to 
change the dining halls radically, so when Local 35's contract expired 
in 1996, they announced a plan to subcontract some dining halls to 
national chains such as Pizza Hut. Threatened with the loss of jobs, 
Local 35 went on strike. 

Later that year, the two sidefreached a deal. Local 35 essential-
ly agreed to a two-tiered wage system. Instead of paying all workers 
$12 per hour, Yale would pay a starting salary of $8.50, with increas-
es in pay of 50 cents every 6 months. The situation was the same for 
custodial workers, only their pay would start at $10 per hour. In 
exchange for the drop in wages, Yale also promised to build a food 
court that would create more jobs for union workers. Yale agreed 
that it would allow subcontracting only if doing so did not require 
firing union workers. Three years later, the food court has not been 
built, Fusco may take over the maintenance of the renovated col-
leges, and a new dispute looms over what wili happen when the cur-
rent contract ends in 2002. 

"We should have never believed them," says Meg Riccio, Chief 
Steward of Local 35, referring to the promise of a food court. "Yale 
has proven that with all the labor struggles they find it difficult to 
support a union on campus." 

Behind the question of subcontracting is the issue of wages. 
New Haven mandates that all full-time government employees be 
paid a living wage of at least $7.50 per hour, and Yale has agreed to 
follow this policy. The contract between Yale and Fusco stipulates 
that all Fusco employees, as well as subcontracted employees, be 
paid this living wage. 

According tO Dawkins, Fusco says irs subcontracted employees 
earn a starting wage between $8 and $8.25 per hour. Some of these 
employees work as much as 6o hours a week. For every hour of 
overtime (hours over 40 per week), Local 35 workers receive a pay 
1.5 times as much as their standard salary. 

Thus, a 6o-hour workweek for a Local 35 
worker results in a wage of $700. Without 
such a policy, the subcontracted worker 
would earn $495· Over the course of a 
year, such a difference could result 
in as much as a $IO,ooo differ-
ence in salaries. In addition, 
subcontracted 
workers 
receive different benefitS 
than Local 35 employees. 

It is the difference 
in 
salary 
that 
Kennington, Gordon, 
and Riccio see as the 
heart of the problem. Says 
Riccio, "What the union is 
doing is simply trying to 
make people earn a decent 
wage in New ·Haven." 

By definition, subcontracted 
workers are not Fusco employees. 
Fusco hires separate companies to per-
form the maintenance, while the company 
NOVEMBER 19, 1999 
runs the management. According to Dawkins, the workers in Swing 
Space actually work for three companies besides Fusco: custodians 
work for OneSource, a second company is in charge of landscaping; 
and a third company maintains heating, air conditioning and 
plumbing. 

Dawkins does not know the name of two of the three subcon-
tracted companies that work at Swing Space, and this is no coinci-
dence; Yale administratOrs only work with Fusco and have no con-
tact with the companies that it subcontractS. Riccio claims that 
some of these employees are actually part of separate unions, but 
since Yale has no contact with these unions, so their wage policies 
are unknown. Thus, while Fusco itself passes Yale's performance 
standard, Yale has put its faith in Fusco that the subcontractors also 
meet Yale's wage standard. 

"The honest thing," says Gordon, "is that no one knows what 
the wages are." 

Riccio takes a more aggressive stance. "It seems that people are 
put into buildings who cannot speak English and no one can com-
municate with," she says. "What's Fusco afraid of?" 

But Yale administrators do not have the same doubtS about 
wages, and they insist that wages and finance are not the main issue. 
In its contract, Fusco agreed to have irs employees work longer 
hours in order to be available to studentS. Says Mullinix, "We are 
looking not so much at a dollar savings but a different package of 
services, particularly at Linsley-Chittenden. At the end of the day, 
I'm not sure we are saving money." 

For Dawkins, the matter has changed little since 1996. While 
Yale could not subcontract the dirung halls to chains such as Pizza 
Hut, the university has managed to subcontract custodial work to 
Fusco. And just as Yale saw Pizza Hut as an improvement in food 
quality, they now see Fusco, its longer hours and irs newer vacuum 
cleaners as an improvement in maintenance. "Subcontracting is just 
a small part of the attempt to improve services all over campus," 
says Dawkins. "I think Local 35 is a good workforce. But times have 
changed."

I
n Fairfield Counry, at the western end of Connecticut, a mos-
quito flies into a crap. Inside chis rypical Cukx pipims, a species 
common to most urban and suburban American environments, 
lives a very uncommon virus. The microscopic ball of nuclc:otides 
and proteins inside the mosquito waits for its host to seek another 
meal. Then the virus can enter another hose, then another, silently 
spreading across the state. 

An hour drive up the coast, in New Haven, a group of brick 
buildings sits on a hill. Inside these ordinary buildings, common to 
academic communities like New Haven, scientistS prepare to ana-
lyze the latest batch of mosquitoes. When the specimens agive from 
across the state, investigators grind them and colleCt the resulting 
serum. They place the samples in cultures of monkey cells and incu-
bate them. After a few days, the cultures will be te,Sted. Standard 
procedure at the Connecticut Agricultural Experirpent Station is to 
rest for six different viruses. Recent developments in nearby New 
York Ciry, though, call for a change from standard procedure. 

W 
ord of New York Ciry's encephalitis outbreak reached Dr. 
James Hadler on Labor Day weekend. Hadler, the 
Connecticut Department of Public Health's chief epidemiologist, 
received a phone caJI informing him that doctors in New York had 
attributed the outbreak to St. Louis Encephalitis, a rare condition 
caused by a mosquito-borne virus. He contacted Dr. Matthew 
Carner, coordinator of Connecticut's Epidemiology Program, and 
Or. John Anderson, Director of the Connecticut Agricultural 
Experiment Station. Connecticut already had an extensive program 
for mosquito control in place, but the mosquito traps were mostly 
in southeastern Connecticut-the usual site for outbreaks of 
Eastern Equine Encephalitis, the disease that prompted the original 
creation of the Mosquito Management Program. In order to assess 
the spread of the St. Louis virus, more traps would be needed in 
Fairfield Counry, near the border with New York. On Sunday, one 
day after the phone conversation, Anderson himself placed the extra 
mosquito traps. Within a week, Connecticut officials would know 
if the disease had followed the path of countless commuters and 
crossed into Connecticut. 

As researchers at the Experiment Station attempted to isolate 
the virus, others did the same at the u.s. Centers for Disease 
Control (coc) and the Universiry of California at Irvine, solicited 
1
by New York officials to assist in the investigation. The same week, 
an both New York and Connecticut, unusual numbers of crows 
were found dead. Birds often serve as a host for the St. Louis virus 
because they are a common blood-supply for mosquitoes; but in the 
past they had only hosted the virus, not shown symptoms. 

Scientists studying the disease thought a connection between the 
human cases and the bird deaths was probable, and that connection 
had ominous implications: either the St. Louis virus had mutated co 
a more virulent form or the outbreak had been caused by another 
virus. A few days after the encephalitis outbreak became national 
news, the coc made an announcement that helped explain the 
unusual avian deaths. 

Before the coc 's announcement, the Mosquito Management! 
Program, led by Connecticut chief medical entomologist Or. 
Theodore Andreadis, isolated strains of the virus in its New Haven 
faciliry. While the various labs involved in the project cooperated, 
Connecticut's Experiment Station received ·little credit in national 
coverage of the outbreak, despite being involved, according ro 
Andreadis, in each step of the investigation. "I believe we had the 
first isolation of the virus," says Andreadis. The Agricultural
