'rd like to go to a small school, perhaps an Ivy League College; said Kendria Vereen (right). 
but he added that only students who push 
for attention receive sufficient gu.idance. 
Not all New Haven students feel their 
schools provide them with inadequate 
guidance. Kendria Vereen, a junior at High 
School in the Community (Hstc), speaks 
confidently about her college plans. ''I'd 
like to go to a small school, perhaps an Ivy 
League college," she informed me. "I need 
one-on-one attention, I don't want to be 
just another face to a professor in a huge 
class." Kendria described the extensive help 
her school's guidance office provides. Every 
Monday, students break up ro meet with a 
faculty advisor in small groups. In addi-
tion, lists of college trips and SAT dates are 
regularly posted outside of the gu.idance 
department. Kendria finds her classes--all 
college preparatory-exciting and chal-
lenging. She becomes particularly animated 
when discussing her Shakespeare acting 
course, in which she has performed scenes 
from Henry V. 
Haml~t, 
Macb~th, and 
Rom~o and juli~t. to name a few. "I just love 
Hamkt," she declared. 

But it seems HSIC is an exception, not 
the rule. A small magnet school with 350 
students and two guidance counselors, it 
sends about 90 percent of its students ro 
college-88 percent to four-year colleges 
and two percent to two-year schools. In 
contrast, between 70 and So percent of all 
students in the New Haven public school 
system continue their education after grad-
uation: 45 to 50 percent ar four-year schools 
and 25 to 30 percent ar two-year or voca-
tional schools. The discrepancy is not due 
to a difference in natural ability. HSIC stu-
dents are selected through a lottery system, 
not by achievement. 

Perhaps part of the secret co HSIC's suc-
cess is the amount of attention and gu.id-
ance that it gives its students. "High School 
in the Community is a college preparatory 
program," Perer Clark, the guidance coun-
selor in charge of all of the school's juniors 
and seniors, explained. "It's the norm here 
tO calk about college for your four years." 
HSIC nor only complies with Beaver's pro-
jected four-year college plan, it surpasses it. 
Each student takes two school-organized 
overnight college trips, one junior year and 
one senior year. Twenty-five ro 30 college 
representatives visit the school ro talk to 
students during the first two months of 
their senior year. 

Clark also claimed that he tries his best 
to involve parents in the college process. 
Each year, he told me, he holds conferences 
with juniors and seniors and their parents 
to discuss their goals for the year. But 
KencL:ia's mother, Cheryl Brown, informed 
me that she has never met with Clark to 
discuss KencL:ia's education. "I have gotten 
one call to tell me that she is Ivy League 
material, but that was from a teacher, not a 
facilitator." Brown, who also has a daughter 
who is a senior at HSIC, said she has met 
with Clark and her older daughter ro dis-
cuss her credit and to narrow her college 
choices to ten. Although Brown is satisfied 
with Kendria's classes and finds the f.acilira-
tors "very cooperative," she thinks they 
should be in touch with parents more 
often. 

But compared ro parents of children 
in other schools, Brown is lucky to have 
received even one phone call. Maribel 
Morales' voice took an angry tone when 
asked how often she hears about Miguel's 
progress at Wtlbur Cross. "The guidance 
department has never contacted me and 
they haven't had college sessions for par-
ents," she said. "I hate how tbe system runs 
in that school. There's only o~e phone line, 
and it's always busy, and when I do get 
through, there's just a secretary with an 
attitude." 

While many may not be able to turn 
to their parents or their schools for help, 
the majority of the students I talked with 
will probably make it to college. Their 
guidance comes from the LEAP program. 
Lalena Garcia, a 1998 Yale graduate who 
heads LEAP's Junior Counselor Resource 
and Advisory program, said it is her job to 
help the program's young employees 
through the college selection and applica-
tion process. "Ninety percent of my Junior 
Counselors definitely want to go to college, 
but don't really know how to get there," she 
observed. "Some schools don't begin to talk 
to students about colleges until they're 
juniors, and many high school SAT classes 
are limited to seniors." 

Garcia provides these students with 
the attention that their schools' guidance 
departments cannot, or do not, provide. 
She keeps a library of information on col-
leges for them, and writes to request appli-
cations. She runs workshops on how to fill 
out a financial aid form and how to write 
an application essay. She bugs them about 
deadlines and makes sure they take their 
SATs. But LEAP cannot employ all of the 
city's students. 

New Haven is capable of improving 
resources for potentially college-bound stu-
dents. The city's total expenditures per stu-
dent amount to S9,013, compared to a state 
average of s8,530. Yet New Haven spends 
only S579 of that sum on pupil support ser-
vices, in comparison to the S703 the aver-
age state school system spends. New Haven 
must attend better to its students' guidance 
and reach out to their parents if the ciry 
expects its ltids to go to college.
