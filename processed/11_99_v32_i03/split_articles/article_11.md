Holloway's story continues in a strange and fantastic web of racism, violence and stalking. a story that is undoubtedly influenced both by her dramatic flair and her mental illness. According to Holloway, she was diagnosed with a mental illness called "tactile demoiselle," which is about hallucination in all five senses. She constantly feels herself being physically abused and, when I interviewed her, she had to stop in the middle of the sentence so she could inspect her orange juice, convinced things swimming in her food.. Holloway has been on the streets of New Haven for the last 19 years, perfecting Shakespeare, Chaucer and Euripides. She makes her home in a crawlspace that she rents for $2 a day, money supplied by a multitude of devoted fans. In the few minutes I had to wait to interview Holloway, "Auntie Woman" came by, as she does every Wednesday after work, to give her five dollars. Another regular visitor brings her some juice, and some papers, and some cow and a few dollars. 

Perhaps Holloway's most important relationship, though, is Yale graduate Anne Dailey, who told her brother, Richard, about the Bennington graduate who was doing theater on the streets of New Haven. Richard came up to start his own research in July, he decided to find funding for a documentary film about her life and her fight against what he calls "limitless illness," he said. 

Holloway's version of Dailey's decision to make the film is far more romantic and, according to Dailey, shows some degree of exaggeration. According to Holloway, she was eating Christmas dinner on the Champs Elys√©es in Paris, when overhead some women called out, "a brilliant Bennington graduate doing theater on the streets of Paris." she said. "He went over to them and asked them to add him more, I knew it had to be me. I'll see you soon," and looked for me until we met to start the movie in August." 

Richard said his version of the story is somewhat different, but added, "Frankly, I wouldn't bet on it. Don't let your imagination get too wild in presenting Shakespeare, do you care about fact in that sense? The imagination's audacious, anyway." 

For two weeks in August, Dailey followed Holloway around New Haven with a hand-held camera. He is currently editing the film in Paris. "I am now trying to shape that material into something that tells Margaret's story and is worthy of her performance," he said. "I am attempting with the material I have to express Margaret's being, story; and what it is about her I feel resonates on a larger truth that touches us all, that is to say the power of the imagination faced with an often hostile reality. Margaret has something to teach us all, and I find it humbling and inspiring in equal measure." 

Ideally, Dailey would like to release the film coincidentally with the power of sufficient prose to supply Holloway with "a decent room in a safe place with a private shower and three squares a day, a place where someone would make sure she took her meds but where she would also retain some of her freedom," he said. 

Holloway, on the other hand, is less optimistic. "Hopefully the movie is going to be a great success, and I'm sure I'll make some money off of it," she said. "And that's fine, because I never wanted a career like Whoopi Goldberg or Meryl Streep. But I also never wanted to suffer like this. Religious people tell me that Jesus' suffering was greater than anyone's and that suffering is a virtue. But I just don't understand why God would do this to me or to anyone else." 

Holloway never predicted that she would be making her living off theater in the way that she does now. But her Yale master's thesis eerily foreshadows how intertwined her life and the theater would eventually become. Holloway wrote about the necessity of a "theater of hunger," a vision of a theater in which the needs of human beings--"ranging from basic needs for food and shelter" ... [to the] need for freedom of the mind, body and spirit"--could be satiated. 

While stage actors play out intensely personal but clearly fictional crises in very public spaces, Holloway lives out her own. Ironically, in doing so, she comes closer to her ideal of a "theater of hunger" than she ever could on stage.
