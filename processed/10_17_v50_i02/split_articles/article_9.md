A program in Edgerton Park for adults with disabilities weathers the state budget crisis

It’s eight-thirty a.m. on a Monday in East Rock’s Edg-
erton Park and Steffen Moore is sweeping the green-
house floor. Moore, who is 35, has already held more 
than seven jobs—at the Mary Wade Home, a New Hav-
en-based home care agency, and various truck stops—but 
these stints were always short-lived. More often than not, 
he was among the 64.6 percent of workers with a disability 
who were unemployed in Connecticut. That is, until his 
caseworker at the Connecticut Department of Develop-
mental Services (DDS)—which serves individuals with 
intellectual disabilities and their families—referred him 
to G.R.O.W.E.R.S., Inc.  


G.R.O.W.E.R.S. stands for “Growing Real Opportuni-
ties With Education, Relationships and Stability.” It’s a 
nonprofit designed to help New Haven adults with phys-
ical and developmental disabilities become self-sufficient 
through horticultural experience, occupational training, 
and education. The program runs every weekday from 
nine a.m. to two p.m. in the greenhouses and community 
gardens of Edgerton Park. G.R.O.W.E.R.S. employees 
pick up participants from their homes and assign them 
a flexible set of chores, such as cleaning up greenhouse 
shelves, raising plants for sale in the greenhouse, and 
maintaining the park. Some participants are also trained 
for landscaping and contracted to take care of private gar-
dens.


“I’ve seen this program do amazing things for a lot of peo-
ple,” said Scott Hickman, who founded G.R.O.W.E.R.S. 
in 2012. “I grew up in a greenhouse, went to school for it, 
but still can’t put my finger [on] how the greenery can 
be so transformative.” G.R.O.W.E.R.S is one of the three 
adult day programs for people with disabilities in New 
Haven, and the only one that provides services for those 
under the age of 60.


But Connecticut’s budget crisis has severely curtailed 
G.R.O.W.E.R.S.’s work. A similar program in the same 
greenhouse, called Greenbrier, shut down in 2011, after 
Connecticut’s $3.4 billion deficit forced it to cut fund-
ing to day programs. Hickman, who served as Green-
brier’s horticulture supervisor, rebuilt the program into 
G.R.O.W.E.R.S. He conceived of a more creative and 
specialized structure: the “Three Paths.” Clients would 
be placed into three groups based on their developmen-
tal and physical ability. Path One was designed for clients 
who wanted to enter the job market. The tasks they were 
assigned—landscaping a private garden, for example—
would improve their job and social skills. Path Two was for 
individuals who needed more supervision, combining tai-
lored instruction and paid work. Path Three would serve 
clients who required even more intensive support, focus-
ing on horticultural therapy to increase overall well-being. 
Connecticut’s budget crisis, however, also clobbered 
G.R.O.W.E.R.S. The organization, which is funded by 
DDS and rents its space from the Edgerton Park Con-
servancy, is only able to employ three full-time staff and 
depends mostly upon volunteers. It also had to effectively 
scrap the “Three Paths” program after Hickman realized 
the difficulty of housing more than one type of work in the 
location. It now accommodates mostly Path Two clients 
within its facility.
