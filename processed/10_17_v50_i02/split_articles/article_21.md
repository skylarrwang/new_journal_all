t took Valerie over 
three years to escape her 
abusive partner. “I moved 
three or four times,” she said. 
“I had to start all over again. 
I had to change my job, the 
vehicle I drove, everything.”
In 2013, Valerie’s partner 
began to act erratically and 
stopped taking his medications. (Victims’ names have 
been changed to protect their identities.) She met with 
her partner’s mental health counselors repeatedly to try 
to stabilize their relationship, but he began to make ver-
bal threats against her. In July 2014, she contacted the 
New Haven Police Department, seeking protection for 
herself and her two children, both under ten years old. 
An officer drove her to a police substation across the 
city from her home. But the officers she met there were 
unsympathetic.
“My very first interaction with them was awful,” Val-
erie said. “They were on their cell phones when taking 
their report. They talked down to me. They knew the 
person I was trying to get away from. Their response was, 
‘What did you expect?’”
That July, Valerie filed for a restraining order, but her 
partner began to break into her home when she was out. 
She contacted the State Police for help, but officers told 
her they couldn’t take action without concrete proof. By 
the year’s end, the situation grew dire. “He showed up 
to my house and said he was going to shoot his gun in 
my face so that no man would ever want to be with me,” 
Valerie said. “That was when I moved.”
For Valerie, the cops’ indifference was merely the 
beginning of an arduous search for safety. After meeting 
with the police, she went to the New Haven office of 
the Connecticut Department of Children and Families, 
but the caseworkers there blamed her for parental neg-
ligence; eventually, she found a caseworker in another 
town. It took two more visits from the state police 
before, in October 2015, Valerie got in contact with a 
victim advocate at the Superior Court on Elm Street 
who referred her to the Umbrella Center for Domestic 
Violence Services, the local support agency. The advo-
cate offered to help Valerie move out of Connecticut 
to protect herself, but her partner further escalated his 
threats, promising to kill Valerie’s family one at a time 
and murder her when she came back for the funeral. 
Fearing for their safety, most of Valerie’s family members 
got gun permits.
Later that month, the police set up a sting operation 
with Valerie to subdue and arrest her partner. She went 
back to the Superior Court to seek criminal charges, and, 
aware that he could be released at any time, sought to 
terminate his parental rights at the civil court on Church 
Street. This January, over a year after the arrest, Valerie 
testified against her partner in court. After that last trial, 
he’s in jail for the foreseeable future. But Valerie’s kids 
don’t play in the same parks as they used to. She no lon-
ger sees any of her old friends. By the time her partner’s 
sentence ends, she expects to have changed her name, 
making her transformation complete.
Valerie’s case is, in many ways, typical. In Greater New 
Haven, it often takes a victim of domestic violence—

victims need?

more than three-quarters of whom are female—at least 
twenty-five hours to meet with all of the advocates she 
needs to start the recovery process. Victims must set up 
appointment after appointment with law enforcement 
officers, lawyers, and counselors, often traveling to each 
one on slow bus lines over several days, just to begin to 
find a path to safety.
“Having to be referred to three or four different loca-
tions, do an intake three or four times, and meet with 
three or four different people, it gets to be a lot on your 
plate,” Valerie said. “It almost deters you to get the sup-
port you need.” For low-income victims working full-
time jobs, the hours required to see a case to its conclu-
sion can be prohibitive.
This summer, local support providers and officials 
made a push to change the system. New Haven Mayor 
Toni Harp and newly-appointed Police Chief Anthony 
Campbell backed a plan to build a new facility called 
the Hope Family Justice Center of Greater New Haven, 
where victims of domestic violence would be able to 
access counseling, legal aid, law enforcement protec-
tion, and child care, among other services, in a cen-
tralized location. The family justice center model has 
helped victims in cities from San Diego to New York, 
and New Haven support advocates have been pushing 
to create one for over a decade. Project planners hope to 
open the facility in downtown New Haven, close to the 
city’s courthouses and along public transit lines, as soon 
as two years from now.
The facility could make it easier for thousands of 
victims in Greater New Haven to escape their abusers 
and establish a new household elsewhere. But in a city 
with rising rates of domestic violence, there are other 
issues the center may not be able to fix. Agencies are 
strapped for resources: legal advocates are overworked, 
shelters across the state are out of beds, and an outdated 
Connecticut policy often forces officers to arrest victims 
along with their abusers. The Hope Family Justice Cen-
ter, when it opens, will be a safe space in the heart of the 
city. The question is whether it will be enough.

E
ven as violent crime rates in New Haven have 
plummeted during the tenures of Chief Dean 
Esserman and Chief Campbell, reports of domes-
tic violence are on the rise. New Haven police made 
943 arrests for domestic violence assaults in 2014, 1,432 
in 2015, and 1,576 last year. “New Haven has one of the 
highest, if not the highest, rates of people being killed 
or injured from domestic violence, from what we know 
in reporting,” said Esperina Stubblefield, Director of 
the Umbrella Center for Domestic Violence Services. 
Although efforts to combat street crime through com-
munity policing have worked, domestic violence—
which usually takes place in the hidden confines of the 
home—requires a different approach.
The New Haven Police Department gets more domes-
tic violence calls than any other kind of call. These situ-
ations are often volatile for officers. “Domestic violence 
is based on control,” said NHPD Detective Kristine 
Cuddy. “When an officer arrives on scene they’re tak-
ing that control.” It’s hard to predict how much danger a 
call will pose. On September 23, two New Haven officers 
were shot in the arm responding to a domestic violence 
dispute on Elm Street in the Dwight neighborhood.
If an officer is able to defuse the situation, the next 
goal is connecting the victim to help, a crucial step that 
changed dramatically five years ago. In the past, there 
was little coordination between cops and support pro-
viders in Connecticut. Police officers who responded 
to a domestic violence incident would simply hand the 
victim a sheet with an agency’s phone number. Nation-
wide, under this system, only about 4 percent of victims 
receive help or counseling.
In 2012, the NHPD distributed a placard with a series 
of eleven questions to every officer. “Has he/she threat-
ened to kill you or your children?” “Does he/she have 
a gun or can he/she get one easily?” These questions 
comprise the Lethality Assessment Program (LAP), a 
protocol used to assess the degree of risk a victim faces. 
The questionnaire includes one demographic question: 
whether the victim’s abuser is employed. “When an 
abusive man is unemployed, there’s both the financial 
strains of unemployment and the notion that unemploy-
ment takes away from traditional masculinities,” Chief 
Campbell said. In New Haven, domestic violence calls 
may be more frequent in low-income neighborhoods 
with higher unemployment rates like Fair Haven and 
the Hill, Campbell added—especially in summertime, 
when temperatures and tempers rise.
In every domestic violence call, the responding offi-
cer must ask all eleven questions. If, based on the vic-
tim’s responses, she is classified as “high-risk,” the officer
