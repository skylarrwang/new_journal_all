with a wellness room where clients take yoga classes. 
Upstairs are rooms for support advocates to meet with 
clients, many of whom are referred by the center’s twenty-four-hour hotline or just walk in; a conference room 
that hosts self-sufficiency classes; and a children’s room 
with jungle murals painted on the walls, Halloween cos-
tumes lining two folding tables in the middle. Children 
of the fifteen clients living in Kathie’s Place, the center’s 
confidential safe house, often can’t go trick-or-treating 
elsewhere, so the center’s employees hold their own Hal-
loween for the kids every fall.

Elizabeth, a victim who sought help at the facility 
while it was still the Center for Women and Children, 
said the support groups she attended there helped her 
recognize and recover from twenty years of abuse. For 
years, her ex-husband manipulated her psychologically, 
becoming furious when she served him the wrong dish 
for dinner or threw out leftover food, and forbidding her 
from leaving the house on weekends. Elizabeth hadn’t 
felt this treatment qualified as abuse, but the support 
group changed everything. “It opened my eyes up,” she 
said. “It was a huge turning point for me. I realized what 
I was going through.” Elizabeth is safe now. Last year, 
she got her Masters in social work, and she has begun 
working for a support agency, helping other survivors 
like her.

The Center for Family Justice is a beautiful facility, 
and above all, it’s efficient. For the typical first-time cli-
ent, the intake process is just an hour long, enough time 
to choose the services she wants, fill out paperwork, and 
get immediate help if her needs are pressing. And every 
victim is guided through the center with an advocate 
at her side, making potentially challenging parts of the 
process, like meeting with law enforcement, easier to 
handle.

In New Haven, a key consideration for Johnson and 
the planning committee is how best to incorporate 
police into the center. “Let’s say the victim comes off 
of the street or calls and comes by and says, ‘I need ser-
vices,’ Johnson said. “One of the first things they’re going 
to be asked is whether they want to speak to law enforce-
ment. If they say no, they’re not going to have any inter-
action with law enforcement.” Chief Campbell echoed 
Johnson’s pledge. “A Family Justice Center should not 
be something that when you say it, the first thing you 
think of is law enforcement,” he said. “The first thing 
people should think about is somewhere they can go to 
obtain resources that will give them a sense of stability 
and hope.”

Given the time and effort it took her to find that same 
sense of stability, Valerie is optimistic about the pros-
pect of a family justice center in New Haven. “It’s just 
a lot of work to get support,” she said. “I’m hoping [this 
will make it] a simplified effort.” The planning commit-
tee has held focus groups with victims to come up with 
ideas for the center, which she views as a promising start. 
“Talking about this is definitely helpful,” Valerie said. 
“As long as you’re talking to the right people about this, 
this support will help people restart their lives.”

If it takes after Bridgeport’s center, the Hope Family 
Justice Center of Greater New Haven will be an island 
of calm, a place where victims have agency, even a pillar 
of the community. For victims, care will be readily avail-
able and accommodating of their needs. It will be some 
time before the center opens, and it may not solve all of 
the system’s many problems. But in a city where agen-
cies are hard to reach, where shelters have no free beds, 
where legal aid is limited, and where victims are arrested 
along with their abusers a fifth of the time, it’s a start.
