same study found that New Haven’s income inequality 
gap has widened the fastest of any city since the Great 
Recession. 

“Both the President and Vice President of Yale live 
in my ward,” Morrison said. “And you have some of the 
poorest in Dixwell, too.”

Considering rising inequality in the neighborhood, 
due in no small part to housing stabilization, DeSte-
fano wondered about the intention of the Homebuyer 
Program’s special incentive in Dixwell. Mansfield is 
not exactly unstable at the moment, and neither is the 
rest of “up-the-hill” Dixwell. He pointed to the safer 
neighborhood statistics and over-saturated housing 
market. 

“Are we trying to fill vacant housing?” he asked rhe-
torically. 

That used to be the intention. But now?
 “Well, to be honest with you, filling vacant housing 
is not a problem in New Haven at this moment,” he 
said. “Forget the downtown rental market, I’m talking 
about the neighborhood rental market.” He spread his 
hands wide. “It’s not a problem! So what are we trying 
to do?”

Despite what Slade describes as the “doom and 
gloom” of the period, the lower property values associ-
ated with Dixwell’s vacancies in the nineties allowed its 
poorer residents to keep living there. 

“A lot of people are angry in feeling that Yale has 
their hands in everything going on and only does what 
is expedient for them,” said Bridgette Russell, who 
works for the New Haven Neighborhood Housing Ser-
vices (NHS), an organization that helps low- and mid-
dle-income residents of New Haven purchase homes. 
 “As Yale usurped more of the properties, the land-
scape was changing,” she said. “Those prices just esca-
lated in the nineties as a lot of change started to take 
place.”

  Russell, who has worked at NHS for over a decade, 
believes her job has become much more urgent since 
she started because the housing market in New Haven 
has become so constricted. She tells her clients to expe-
dite their homebuying processes. 

“You need to own. At least then you have some 
power. If you’re renting, there’s a greater chance you 
will be pushed out.” She paused and reconsidered. “In 
fact, if you don’t own a home, you’re eventually going 
to be pushed out.”


A 
few blocks away from Cleary’s home, Slade 
stopped in front of a small, brown building. 
Inside, behind windows made from squares of 
thick antiqued glass, there is a large, empty space. On 
the front, a rumpled yellow sign: “FOR RENT: Stu-

dio Apt.” And another: “FOR LEASE: 1000 sq. ft.” The 
house behind it has slats missing on the front, a board-
ed-up window on the second floor. A closed deli and 
grocery store are next door. According to Slade, this 
little brown building with the wavy glass window used 
to be the spot for jazz in Dixwell. Now, she’s heard 
rumors that developers are going to tear it down.

“New Haven is the tale of two cities,” Slade said as 
she walked away up Dixwell Avenue again. “The best 
of times and the worst of times. The home of the fit and 
the fat, the home of the have and the have-nots.”

Longtime Dixwell residents watching their neigh-
borhood change say they feel left behind. Although the 
neighborhood has grown wealthier and safer during the 
past two decades, in part through the influence of Yale 
and city-wide policies, some residents see only part of 
that population—the up-the-hill, Yale part—reaping 
the benefits. It seems that the disconnect between the
