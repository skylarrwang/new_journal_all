ELEVEN HOURS
Grappling with loss in the shadow of the eclipse

leven hours. My grandfather is dead. Depart PDX 
1:15, arrive PHL 11:57, with a brief layover in Min-
neapolis. Before that, three hours from Newport to 
Portland, and two hours for check-in. The bus picks me 
up from the Hatfield Marine Science Center dormitories 
at 6:00 a.m. Seven minutes of goodbyes to my thirteen 
fellow interns, plus twenty for breakfast, plus making sure 
I didn’t forget anything, plus five to rub the sleep out my 
eyes. Later, an hour-long drive from the airport back to 
the Philadelphia suburbs, through a balmy Mid-Atlantic 
summer night. Twenty-one hours. My grandfather is dead.

My mother and aunt were in Madison, Wisconsin, 
organizing the funeral. The service would take place at 
Milwaukee’s St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral, where 
my grandfather had chaired the founding board. The 
funeral itself would take place an hour and a half south 
of Milwaukee, in Libertyville, a Chicago suburb and the 
center of American Serbdom. King Peter II, who died in 
exile during the Yugoslav years, was buried in the ornately 
frescoed church there, until his recent exhumation and 
reburial in Serbia. My grandfather would be interred out-
side, up the hill from his immigrant parents and all the 
other deceased relatives on my mother’s side. When my 
parents and I drive from Philadelphia to New York, I get 
a glimpse of the harbor from the I-95. I like to imagine 
those ancestors seeing the Statue of Liberty as their steam-
ers approached Ellis Island. I like to think that they were 
overjoyed.

My plane reached Philadelphia a few minutes early, 
but my father had already parked the car and was wait-
ing at the doors of the security area. He is used to long 
days of air travel, and wary of its unpredictable rhythms. I 
don’t remember whether he had a thermos of coffee in his 
hand, as he often does late at night. “Bonjour, mon fils. 
Je t’aime,” he said, and we hugged. I told him it was good 
to be back, that I was very glad to see him, and I was. The 
next day, we would travel to Milwaukee for the funeral. I 
was relieved not to be going alone.

My father pulled the car into our driveway at about 
1:30 am on August 25. My birthday was on August 21. My 
grandfather’s death was on August 20. On August 19, I 
went snorkeling. My marine biologist friends and I drove 
down to the jetty that lines the mouth of the Yaquina River 
on the Pacific Ocean. We followed the line of black boul-
ders towards the ocean, trying to escape Yaquina Bay’s 
soupy waters. But the tide was going out, bringing with it 
all the small crustaceans, algae, and detritus of the fertile 
estuary. Below the cloudless sky, we put on our wetsuits 
and dove into waters rich with plankton, and undergirded 
by rocks covered in sea stars and anemones. We fought 
the tide, which was dragging us towards the ocean. After 
a half hour, our faces and hands began to go numb, so 
we climbed out into the warm air. We wrestled our wet-

suits off of our bodies, and walked back down the jetty. 
Squinting under a constant volley of windblown sand and 
the reflection of the sun on the white dunes, I felt dis-
oriented but relaxed, as one feels after waking up from a 
long and unintended nap. A half hour after we emerged 
from the water, my mother texted me that my grandfather 
was in the hospital, this time for something very serious. 
That evening, when my aunt realized he would not wake 
up from his afternoon nap, she held her cellphone up to 
his ear, and I offered him a final narrative of my life. I 
told him about swimming and running on the beach, and 
said that I was happy and that I loved him. At 2:30 a.m., I 
received the message. My grandfather is dead.

The next day, I walked through the marshes outside the 
science center, and went to my lab early. There, I raced to 
measure the weights of enough dried shrimp to complete 
my summer research project, but unlike the week before, 
I was not anxiously thinking of statistical tests or sample 
sizes or finding previous studies on parasitic castration. I 
had not been stressed about my research the day before, 
either, as I sat with my friends in a beachfront café, regain-
ing the warmth stolen by pacific waters. Following my 
mother’s message, the impending death of my grandfather 
had become the only thing worth worrying about. By the 
next day, his death had removed even this concern. There 
was no more uncertainty, only a thick, dim sadness under 
which I strolled through the marsh and played beach vol-
leyball after work, looking forward to tomorrow, when the 
sun would disappear.

August 21, the day of my twenty-first birthday, the day 
after my grandfather’s death, was also the day of the total 
eclipse. By luck, I was interning in a region of Oregon 
which lay right in the path of totality. To avoid the coastal 
fog of Newport, nine of the other interns and I headed 
East to the interior Willamette Valley on the night of the 
twentieth. At 9:45 a.m. the next morning, in Corvallis, 
Oregon, we walked up a forested hill, hoping to catch the 
first darkened sliver of the sun.

The sun is the diplomat of time. It makes time tan-
gible on Earth. Flowers open and close with it. Insects, 
birds, and frogs time their calls to it. Air and water grow 
cold and hot, and the onshore wind becomes an offshore 
wind at dusk, vice versa at dawn. We sleep and wake with 
the sun, knowing that a day has passed. I have heard that 
people locked in a sunless room risk losing their sense of 
time. The constancy of the sun makes its disappearance, 
and the ensuing twilight, jarring. Its authority over us is 
undermined—we realize that its presence is subject to 
something else, to the frail moon passing over it, suddenly 
converting day into dusk, exposing planets, dropping the 
temperature, and illuminating the headlights of cars on 
the highway below us. The sun’s temporal authority is top-
pled with seeming randomness, and the day and its inhab-
itants become liberated from time. Until we have forgot-
ten the unmistakable shades of that late morning twilight 
and the sun has firmly reclaimed its reputation, the day is 
a free day, unbound from the laws of time. This is what I 
felt as we walked down the hill, picking wild blackberries 
from the brambles beside a path through a wide field. At 
10:50 a.m., the sun had vanished, and a day before, my 
grandfather had died. WHAT WAS I OBLIGED TO DO, WHAT 
COULD I DO, BESIDES ENJOY THE 
BERRIES AND THE WARM LIGHT OF A 
CLOUDLESS SKY?

My friends and I drove to a bar with a large patio and a 
DJ. Still there was no obligation to time—Monday, mid-
day, and people were sitting at picnic tables, slouching 
over cocktails and beer, discussing, as we always have, 
the mysteries of the sky. Because it was hot and early, I 
chose a cider as my first legal drink. Before I could object, 
Dustin had ordered himself a cocktail and paid for both 
of us. As the others ordered, the two of us walked out-
side and claimed a table. I felt unusually calm, sipping 
my cider there. There was nothing more to worry about—
not death, not the disappearing sun, not even handing 
my ID to a bartender. All of these had already happened. 
My cider was light, I was content. The sun was warm. My 
grandfather is dead.

The sun was also warm in Libertyville on August 27. 
At the cemetery, I carried the large white cross that in 
Serbian Orthodoxy serves as a temporary grave marking. 
Behind me was the priest, his censer perfuming the air 
with frankincense, his chanting amplified by that smell. 
My father, my uncle, and the other pallbearers lay the 
casket on metal bars stretched across the open grave, and 
I propped the cross against it. My mother and aunt stood 
beside the casket, alone, as the priest recited prayers over 
it. The priest poured grain on it, in the shape of a cross. 
He poured wine over the grain. The mourners dispersed 
and gathered around a nearby folding table that supported 
three bottles—one of brandy, one of the plum brandy 
sljivovica, and one of ginger ale—a baking pan of warm, 
sweet pogaca bread, honey, and a dish of koljivo, the
THE SUN IS THE DIPLOMAT OF TIME. 
IT MAKES TIME TANGIBLE ON EARTH.
