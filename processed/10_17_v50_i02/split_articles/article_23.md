wedding anniversary, and he was being sworn in as the 
New Haven Chief of Police.
A 44-year-old from Harlem, Campbell attended Yale 
Divinity School and planned to become a Jesuit priest. 
But in 1998, he entered the New Haven Police Depart-
ment, drawn to its policy of community policing, in 
which officers build ties with community members. By 
2016, Campbell had risen to the rank of Assistant Chief. 
After the departure of embattled former Chief Dean 
Esserman, Campbell was a clear replacement. Mayor 
Harp, who regularly worked with domestic violence 
victims in her twenty-seven years as a homeless services 
outreach advocate at Cornell Scott-Hill Health Center, 
wanted to make the family justice center a focus of her 
reelection campaign. In promoting Campbell, she ele-
vated an officer who shares her priorities.
At the ceremony, Campbell emphasized his support 
for the Mayor’s mission to combat domestic violence. 
“Her commitment is unparalleled,” Campbell said of 
Harp, his voice soft and reedy. “She realizes we must 
bring domestic violence and intimate partner violence 
to a halt. She wants to bring a family justice center to 
New Haven.”
Since LAP was implemented in 2012, New Haven 
Police have been able to connect more victims to sup-
port providers, but that hasn’t addressed the true prob-
lem: domestic violence itself. Campbell sees community 
policing as crucial to keeping abuse at bay. “A big part of 
the pattern of domestic violence is isolation, whether it’s 
self-isolation or a control mechanism of the offender,” 
Campbell said. “Community policing is in direct con-
trast to isolation.” This fall, Chief Campbell is working 
with the police union to distribute department-issued 
phones to officers so that they can give their numbers 
out to residents on their beat.
Once the Hope Family Justice Center opens its doors, 
New Haven police will have an opportunity to build fur-
ther trust. Former NHPD police captain Julie Johnson, 
leader of New Haven’s planning committee, said that in 
cities like Milwaukee, centers have become community 
institutions. “With a family justice center, you want your 
community to know it’s there,” Johnson said. “You want 
people to walk in off the street who wouldn’t call the 
police. It’s public knowledge.” The LAP and the family 
justice center model could work in tandem to connect 
victims to services more fluidly and provide communi-ty-based support.
But without changes in the law, all New Haven com-
munity policing initiatives may be for naught. In 1984, 
after the husband of a woman named Tracey Thurman 
attacked and stabbed her, Thurman sued the Torrington 
Police Department in Connecticut, claiming the police 
had disregarded the danger she faced in past calls to her 
home. The case precipitated sweeping changes to Con-
necticut’s domestic violence legislation, most notably 
through the Family Violence Prevention and Response 
Act, enacted in 1986. The act included a “mandatory 
arrest” provision for officers, requiring the arrest of 
alleged perpetrators “if there is probable cause to believe 
that person committed a family violence crime.” In cases

where a victim uses physical force in self-defense, the 
officer, seeing signs that the abuser and the victim hurt 
each other, often has to arrest both. This practice, known 
as a “dual arrest,” can embroil victims in lengthy legal 
struggles.
All other states with mandatory arrest clauses, includ-
ing New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island, have passed 
“primary aggressor” legislation requiring officers to 
attempt to identify which partner instigated the violence 
and avoid arresting the other party. But in Connecticut, 
a 2004 General Assembly bill to implement a similar 
protocol was stripped of most of its provisions. The state 
legislature has acted aggressively in recent years to pro-
tect victims of domestic violence, passing laws requiring 
the subjects of temporary restraining orders to give up 
firearms and criminalizing nonviolent stalking behavior 
that causes severe emotional distress. But the Thurman 
Law, thirty-one years later, remains largely unchanged.
Today, Connecticut is the only state where victims 
are arrested on a regular basis. According to a Febru-
ary ProPublica report, the national dual arrest rate in 
domestic violence incidents is around 2 percent. Even 
though NHPD officer training emphasizes avoiding dual 
arrests, New Haven’s rate last year was almost 19 percent. 
Gwinn, the founder of the family justice center model, 
said he hopes the New Haven center will be the impe-
tus for change in legislation and practice. Even in the 
absence of new state laws, the New Haven Police Depart-
ment could enact a primary aggressor policy at the local

level, he suggested. Unless this change is made, victims 
of abuse may hesitate to call for help at all.


**Title: New Haven Superior Court**

New Haven Superior Court
121 Elm Street
T
he New Haven Superior Court, where hearings 
of domestic violence criminal cases take place, 
is an imposing building. Six Ionic columns stand 
imperiously out front, and visitors are greeted with a 
metal detector when they walk inside. The sounds of 
murmured conversation and brisk footsteps echo coldly 
back and forth in the atrium.
At one domestic violence court session this Septem-
ber, a woman sat with two young girls, their hair in 
beaded braids, on either side of her. They leaned on 
each of her shoulders, waiting for the hearings to start. 
The session opened at 10:30 a.m. In the thirty-eight min-
utes before the judge took the bench, a man sitting in 
the audience behind them grew impatient. “I lost like 
thirty hours of work already,” he said to the room. “I’m 
about to turn into the judge. Judge Harris says everybody 
get the fuck out of here. I don’t even want to go to work. 
I just want to go home and go to bed now.” As the wait 
continued, a woman walked into the courtroom and sat 
in the front row. “Damn,” he laughed, loud enough for 
everyone else to hear. “Look at that bitch.” The woman 
and girls sat quietly.
Legal aid is a crucial part of recovery, in both short-
term survival and long-term safety, but it’s a complex 
process that can expose victims to traumatic environ-
ments like this. Victims often have to meet with victim

advocates at the Superior Court to prepare for crimi-
nal trials, file for restraining orders at the civil court on 
Church Street, and seek help with divorce proceedings 
and financial assistance at the offices of New Haven 
Legal Assistance on State Street.
Legal advocates hope to locate New Haven’s family 
justice center as close to the downtown courthouses as 
possible. But Barbara Bellucci, the Umbrella Center’s 
Family Violence Victim Advocate Supervisor, wants 
to go a step further. “Victims often want to meet with 
attorneys personally. This often takes place at the [Supe-
rior Court], which is not a space that’s particularly trau-
ma-sensitive,” she said. “I hope there will be space for 
advocates to meet at the family justice center, and a 
place for kids to play and be engaged while Mom talks 
to the prosecutor.”
Given the prevalence of domestic violence, New 
Haven’s legal advocates are perpetually inundated with 
cases. At the Superior Court, the Umbrella Center’s six 
Family Violence Victim Advocates received twenty-four 
hundred new cases in the last fiscal year. Around five 
years ago, funding cuts eliminated the two attorneys in 
the Connecticut Attorney’s Office strictly dedicated to 
domestic violence cases, placing even more strain on 
the system. Now, prosecutors and victim advocates hold 
quarterly roundtable meetings, and each Judicial Dis-
trict has a designated liaison prosecutor who receives 
additional training for domestic violence cases. But in 85 
percent of family-related cases in Connecticut, at least 
one party is self-represented, meaning low-income vic-
tims of abuse often have to fight for their safety without 
the help of an attorney.
In recent years, support agencies have begun serving 
more undocumented immigrants, who often hesitate to 
reach out for help, fearing deportation. The Battered 
Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000 established 
the U-Visa, which grants temporary legal status, with a 
pathway to citizenship, to immigrants who are victims 
of crimes. In situations where deportation is imminent, 
legal advocates can prioritize their visa applications. 
But not every undocumented victim knows about the 
U-Visa, or feels she can safely apply for it. “We want to 
get the word out that whether a victim is undocumented 
or not, we will provide service,” Bellucci said. “We don’t 
want anyone to be isolated.”
Facing similar challenges, the Bridgeport Center for 
Family Justice started a legal incubator program this 
February, working with the Greater Bridgeport Bar Asso-
ciation to bring in low bono and pro bono legal services 
and providing office space for five attorneys to start pri-
vate practices. “Attorneys come from everywhere,” said 
Debra Greenwood, Executive Director of Bridgeport’s 
center. “If we had the space we could have brought in 
ten.” Through a similar program, New Haven’s center 
could ease the burden placed on the Superior Court’s 
advocates. “We already have a relationship with legal 
aid, but if we get a center, we would try to increase that 
access, hopefully utilizing the many colleges and law 
schools in the area,” Johnson said. “There are just not 
enough free legal services.”

753 Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport
J
ohnson, Stubblefield, and other planning commit-
tee members for the Hope Family Justice Center of 
Greater New Haven have toured centers in San Diego, 
Milwaukee, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Bridgeport to 
piece together a plan for New Haven’s center. Accord-
ing to Johnson, the Bridgeport Center for Family Justice 
could serve as a model for the planning committee.
The lobby of the Bridgeport center is adorned with a 
brightly colored mural, the rainbow silhouettes of hands 
extending from the borders to the center. “Hands are not 
for hitting,” it reads. The first floor has a waiting room 
with a fishtank in the corner, a room for intake meetings 
with a box of tissues at the ready, and a forensic interview 
room for victims of child abuse. Downstairs are offices 
for attorneys, prosecutors, and law enforcement, along 
Elm Street Superior Court in New Haven.
