EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
There’s a house on the corner of Adeline and Eddy 
Streets that doesn’t fit in. The rest of the block is lined 
with soft-colored clapboard houses with peeling paint or 
dented siding. Many are separated from the sidewalk by 
wire fences, some of which have begun to lean over or 
cave in. But 54 Adeline Street has stark-white wooden 
panels and a dramatic, sloping roof. Large, glossy, rect-
angular bay windows pop out from its sides. Its concrete 
porch contains a built-in metal flower bed. There’s no tra-
ditional front door; instead, an open space in the middle 
of the house beneath the roof serves as the entrance to its 
two apartments. One passing driver slows down to take 
a closer look.  “That’s hot!” he calls, leaning out of his 
window.

But the house isn’t just an anomaly in appearance. It’s 
the final product of the 2017 Jim Vlock Building Project, 
a mandatory program for all first-year graduate students in 
the Yale School of Architecture. Last spring, students were 
tasked with creating a house for homeless city residents. 
After they submitted proposals, their professors collaborat-
ed with Columbus House, a local nonprofit dedicated to 
reducing homelessness, to choose a winning design. Co-
lumbus House acquired the site, a lot in the Hill neigh-
borhood, from the New Haven Housing Authority. The 
Architecture students built the house this past summer. 
In part, the house at 54 Adeline Street was an intel-
lectual exercise for the students, an opportunity to test 
out concepts they had learned in class in the real world. 
The assignment extended beyond just drafting plans for 
a house and seeing it built; students attempted to incor-
porate design features that would take the psychological 
needs of its new residents into consideration. Yet for its 
future inhabitants, this house will be a long-term home––
perhaps their first in a while. How easily can a home built 
to address the challenges of this transition become part of 
the neighborhood?


At an evening ceremony on the first Monday of Oc-
tober, the sleek new house opened for the first time. 
Over a hundred people walked in and out of the empty 
rooms, running their hands across the wood of the cabi-
nets and the thin, white railing along the stairs. One roof 
extended over the gap between the house’s two units—a 
single-bedroom “efficiency” unit meant for one person or 
couple, and a family unit, which has upstairs bedrooms 
intended for parents and children. Each apartment has 
a dishwasher and washing machine. Big, spherical lights 
hang from the ground-floor ceilings. Only the lawn was 
unfinished, a plot of dirt waiting for grass.

Among the visitors were New Haven Mayor Toni Harp, 
Yale President Peter Salovey, and School of Architecture 
Dean Deborah Berke. In a speech in the backyard, Sa-
lovey praised the project as a model for the University’s 
mutually beneficial engagement with New Haven.

In daylight, the house looked conspicuously modern 
and angular, its exterior startlingly clean. But as the sky 
darkened, there was something comforting about it, as 
light filled the windows and people chatted inside. The 
wooden façade glowed faintly blue.

Walking inside the house, it was tempting to picture 
what it would look like when residents move in a few 
weeks later. What the bed in this room would look like, 
what kind of food would be waiting in the fridge. May-
be a child would discover her favorite books curled up in 
that window seat. Maybe someone would lie awake in this 
bedroom, unable to sleep. Maybe the family would play 
board games on the kitchen table. Maybe, when it rains, 
they would leave their umbrellas to dry by the door. But it 
could also take a long time for it to feel like a home.


In 1967, Charles Moore, head of Yale’s Department of 
Architecture––what would eventually become the pro-
fessional School of Architecture––founded the Building 
Project. Moore wanted to give his students practical ex-
perience, but the project was also a response to the stu-
dent activism that roiled Yale during the nineteen-sixties. 
Moore hoped his students would recognize their respon-
sibility as architects to address pressing social issues like 
poverty and homelessness.

For Dan Whitcombe, one of the student project man-
agers and a member of the team that created the winning 
2017 design, the educational aspect of the project was in-
valuable. 
“Not for a while will you be able to design houses as 
you see fit and then have the potential to see them built,” 
he said. Kerry Garikes, the other project manager, said 
that the assignment helped her better understand the 
design potential and restrictions of space. There’s a big 
difference, she added, between creating a room on a com-
puter and watching it materialize on a real block.

In past years, the Building Project has collaborated 
with organizations like Neighborhood Housing Services, 
Breaking Ground (formerly known as Common Ground), 
and Habitat for Humanity to connect the house with a 
family in need of affordable housing. The current part-
nership with Columbus House will last for five years—
one house with two units each year. 
Columbus House will select the future inhabitants of 
54 Adeline Street, and like the residents of the organiza-
tion’s other properties, they will contribute thirty percent 
of their income towards rent. A resident’s income could 
range from anything between $25 and $700 a month, 
according to Alison Cunningham, the CEO of Colum-
bus House. She added that their clients are not simply 
assigned a housing unit, but work with the organization to 
find a home that best fits their needs.

Prior to starting the design process, the Architecture 
students visited a shelter run by Columbus House, as well 
as the homes of several formerly homeless people. Over 
the course of the semester, they met with social workers 
to discuss national and city-wide homelessness, and the 
psychological challenges of transitioning from a shelter 
to a home. 
The students also spoke in small groups with Colum-
bus House clients about what they most desired in a 
home. School of Architecture professor Adam Hopfner, 
who has directed the Building Project since 2007, said the 
clients his students spoke to expressed two primary wish-
es. One was security: in Hopfner’s words, “the emotional 
state of being homeless, the feeling of exposure and vul-
nerability…runs fairly deep.” The other was a connection 
to the neighborhood: “having eyes on the street, being 
able to see one’s neighbors, being able to communicate 
with one’s neighbors,” he said. 
To create a strong sense of safety and stability, Archi-
tecture students designed a roof that extends more than a 
foot beyond the house’s four walls. A sheltered space that 
is open to the street, it creates a buffer zone between the 
interior and exterior of the house. The slope of the roof 
is visible from the inside, too; even on the first floor of 
the two-story family unit, the ceiling above the staircase 
is at an incline. “The presence of the roof is always felt,” 
Hopfner said.

A porch with a built-in planter will curve around the 
house on both Adeline and Eddy Streets, allowing resi-
dents to participate in neighborhood life from a protected 
vantage point. 
These aesthetic considerations cut both ways, Whit-
combe said. “How do we integrate this person visually 
into this community?” he asked. “How do we make this 
house a part of the community, but also account for the 
fact that there are definite anxieties associated with being 
housed for the first time?”
