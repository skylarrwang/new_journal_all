WHAT’S WITH THAT PAINTING?
P O I N T  O F  D E PA R T U R E
The hidden story of the strangest painting in Berkeley’s dining hall
Mariah Kreutter
T
he Head of College portraits in Yale dining 
halls don’t usually register as art. Nobody shows 
up looking for them. Nobody gazes at them, 
trancelike, for whole minutes at a time. They’re just 
there, ubiquitous and inevitable. Like midterms or Yale 
Granola™. As is the case with so much public art, they 
have become part of the landscape.


One striking exception is the 2001 portrait of former 
Head of College Harry “Skip” Stout in the Berkeley 
College dining hall. By the admittedly staid standards 
of its brethren, it’s a radical piece. It has none of the 
standbys of the genre: no doctoral robes, no muted 
color palette, and certainly no slavish devotion to real-
ism. Stout’s face is done in pastel pinks and greens, the 
paint so sheer that the pencil tracings underneath are 
visible. The background is a stark black, broken up only 
by a wobbly green stripe across the top of the painting. 
A trio of projectile Berkeley shields race towards Stout’s 
head, complete with speed lines, resembling nothing 
so much as nuclear warheads.


In my experience, the portrait’s social good is its role 
as a reliable conversation starter between awkward first-
years. But student opinion remains divided on its par-
ticular merits:
Anonymous Silliman Sophomore: “That shit is 
whack.” 
Molly Ono, Stiles Sophomore: “Hey, I like it.” 
Berkeley Student who later retracted his 
identity: “Honestly, just say whatever bad thing you 
want about that painting and give me credit for it, 
because it’s probably true.” 


The painting has fascinated me ever since I came to 
Yale. Who painted it? Why is it so different from all the 
other portraits? Why the green stripe? Why the flying 
shields? And why is it so...well, ugly?


Perhaps unsurprisingly, the painting wasn’t done 
by a professional portraitist. It was painted by Richard 
Beggs, an Academy Award-winning sound designer 
known for his work with two generations of Coppolas 
on films such as Apocalypse Now and Lost in Trans-
lation. While Beggs trained as a painter, receiving 
his MFA from the California College of the Arts, he 
quickly became disillusioned with what he saw as the 
hypocrisy, pretension, and infighting of the art world. 
He spent a portion of his MFA grant money on audio 
equipment and more or less never looked back. By the 
time Stout asked him to do his official portrait, Beggs 
hadn’t painted seriously in years. So why did Stout spe-
cifically request him? “It wasn’t about his art, per se,” 
said the former Head of College.


A year before Stout became Head of Berkeley in 
1990, Beggs’s daughter, Samantha, died in a car acci-
dent in the summer before what would have been her 
sophomore year. (The annual Samantha Landau Beggs 
Prize, awarded to a “first-year student whose presence is 
profoundly felt throughout the Berkeley community,” 
is named in her honor.) Beggs was made an Associate 
Fellow of the College and would visit each year, staying 
in the guest suite of what is now the Swensen House 
and striking up a friendship with Stout along the way.


Eventually, Stout returned the favor, visiting Beggs 
at his home in San Francisco. The way Beggs tells it, 
Stout was impressed by a series of portraits of well-
known composers Beggs had done during his grad-stu-
dent days. But Stout remembers it differently: “I was 
struck when I got to his house that there were all of

these half-finished paintings…He said they were unfin-
ished portraits of his daughter, signifying her unfin-
ished life.” After learning about his formal training in 
painting, Stout asked Beggs if he would do the official 
portrait, a custom at the end of a Berkeley Head’s ten-
ure.


At first, Beggs thought Stout was joking; he was even 
more surprised when he found out how much money 
the Berkeley Fellows had raised to pay him for it. “I was 
like, are you fucking kidding me?” Beggs recalled. 
But Stout wasn’t kidding, so Beggs took on the proj-
ect. He was given very few constraints beyond making 
Stout recognizable in the portrait. In his early years as a 
painting student, Beggs drew inspiration from Abstract 
Expressionist and neo-figurative painters such as Rich-
ard Diebenkorn and Francis Bacon. His take on Stout’s 
portrait was never going to be conventional: “I couldn’t 
do it any other way, and if they’d asked me to I would’ve 
said no.”


Stout remembers his reaction when he first saw the 
finished painting: “Who is that guy?” But he wasn’t 
disappointed. He doesn’t claim to know what the gen-
eral reception was among the other Fellows, but the 
response from Duncan Robinson, art historian and 
then-director of the Yale Center for British Art, stuck 
with him. “He said to me, ‘Skip, you’re going to appre-
ciate this more and more over time.’” Stout grins. “And 
I do appreciate it. It did grow on me.”


Through my conversations with Stout and Beggs, I 
finally know why the green stripe is there (to break up 
the black, and as a subtle nod to Stout’s love for golf). 
I understand the shields, at least somewhat (they add 
dynamism and movement to the painting, and, at least 
according to Stout, evoke Star Wars). 


And, more than I did before, I understand the por-
trait’s appeal. We’re okay with art that is strange and 
shocking being placed in museums. But because Beggs’s 
portrait is showcased in a dining hall, it’s branded as 
“ugly,” an oddity. But if Jeff Koons gets to stack two 
vacuum cleaners on top of each other and have people 
flock to the the Whitney to see it, then shouldn’t we 
be a little more open-minded about an unusual Head 
of College portrait? And maybe, in the end, the dining 
hall is the best place for the painting. At a gallery, it 
might be lost amid all the strangeness, but in Berkeley, 
it’s distinct, even endearing. After talking with Beggs 
and learning the human story behind the painting, I 
felt I appreciated it more. Maybe Duncan Robinson 
was right—the portrait seems to be growing on me.
