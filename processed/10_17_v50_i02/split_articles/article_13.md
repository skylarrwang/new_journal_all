THE  NEW  JOURNAL
T
he Architecture students attempted to design a house 
that would give its formerly homeless inhabitants a 
pronounced sense of security, comfort, and agency. But 
they also wanted to create a home that would eventually 
integrate into the neighborhood without foregrounding 
its residents’ past. “We didn’t hold back at all and make it 
specifically ‘homeless person-oriented,’” Whitcombe said. 
“I think any of us would be happy to live in this house.” 
Yet the residents of Building Project homes aren’t al-
ways welcomed like any new neighbors. Since 2010, the 
Building Project has created homes in West River, Ne-
whallville, Dwight, and the Hill. Columbus House origi-
nally hoped to build this year’s house in Prospect Hill, but 
it didn’t go over smoothly. According to Hopfner, some 
residents––including the local alderwoman––resisted the 
Architecture School’s attempts to move new residents in. 
They didn’t want to have “homeless” neighbors—despite 
the fact that, of course, their neighbors would no longer 
be homeless, he said. The project ended up being relo-
cated to the Hill, next to a preexisting Columbus House 
property, Valentine Macri Court, which contains seven-
teen units of affordable housing. 

Usually, Columbus House aims to offer services to the 
entire homeless population of New Haven, regardless of 
a person’s criminal background or history of substance 
abuse. But when determining eligibility for the efficiency 
unit of the Building Project house, the organization will 
consider a person’s criminal background, given that chil-
dren will likely live in the family unit next door.

Both Hopfner and Cunningham say that the Hill has 
welcomed the new house with open arms. “We are ex-
cited about the build[ing] of another Yale/Vlock project 
in the Hill and [Yale’s] partnering with the Columbus 
House,” a user named “Hill Resident” wrote in an online 
comment on a July article in the New Haven Independent. 
“We look forward to welcoming the students during the 
build, and the tenants after the units are rented. This ad-
dition will be a wonderful addition to all the ‘good stuff’ 
that is happening and continues to happen in the Hill!”

B
enito Romero, who lives around the corner from the 
new house on Adeline Street, said he has never spo-
ken with the Architecture students and didn’t know that 
formerly homeless tenants would soon occupy the house. 
As he washed his car on the street, he said that the neigh-
borhood is not a close-knit community. “We spend all our 
time working,” he explained in Spanish. Romero com-
mutes to New York City, where he works at an asphalt 
company. His work day begins at five in the morning and 
ends at ten at night. “We hardly spend any time chatting 
with people because we’re not here very often,” he said. 
“We’re working a lot of the time.”

Keith Dowdy was sitting on a porch two houses down 
from the Vlock house. He watched as his nephew, a little 
boy who said his name was “Jacoby Flash Batman Su-
perman,” ran back and forth between the front yard and 
the sidewalk. Dowdy said he had watched the house take 
shape over the course of the summer. “It’s a nice design,” 
he said. “Probably too much for this neighborhood. Like, 
a house with that design needs to be on a lake or some-
thing.”

The Architecture students were clearly visitors to the 
neighborhood, Dowdy said. “It’s part of their grade for 
their semester. Imagine a house in a neighborhood where 
all the houses are ranging from four-hundred to a half a 
million [dollars], and then you see that.” He pointed to a 
single-story house across the street, with a slightly dent-
ed metal gate. “It’s like, really? And that’s how [the new 
house] is, just the opposite.”

Dowdy mentioned that the School of Architecture built 
another house in the neighborhood—the 2010 Building 
Project home on King’s Place. It had looked jarring at 
first, but now seemed like a part of the neighborhood. “It’s 
older now,” he said. “It was just put up for a minute, and 
people lived in it. Once all the hoopla was over, it just 
started being a regular old house.”
