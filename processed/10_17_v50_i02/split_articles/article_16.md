awn Slade knows everyone and everything 
on Dixwell Avenue. Walking up the street—
which runs north from downtown New Haven 
and Yale University toward Hamden—one morning 
this past spring, she nodded at Lake Place, where many 
residents are Yale undergraduates.
“Look at them, on Lake and Broadway,” she said. 
“You started to see them inching up. Inching, inching, 
inching.”

Born in 1960, Slade grew up in Dixwell and now 
lives in Beaver Hills, a nearby neighborhood. She is 
the cofounder and executive director of Nuts About 
Health, Inc., a nonprofit that promotes healthy living 
for lower-income families. She walks over a mile every 
Sunday to the Varick Memorial AME Zion Church­— 
founded in the eighteen-hundreds by former slaves and 
home to a pulpit from which Booker T. Washington 
delivered his final public address—which she attended 
with her grandmother every weekend during her child-
hood. Nine historically Black churches line the half-
mile stretch of Dixwell Avenue from Lake Place to 
Henry Street. 

For every storefront on Dixwell Avenue, Dawn has 
a memory: she would skip past this store on her way 
home from school; her grandmother’s friends would 
shop at that one; this was one of the first Black-owned 
businesses in New Haven. She remembers the tightly 
knit neighborhood community of her childhood in the 
nineteen-seventies, the crippling effects of the War on 
Drugs in the eighties, the vacancy and crime of the 
nineties.

Now, she watches the neighborhood change again, 
becoming more residential and less Black. Slade 
pointed across Dixwell Avenue at a Yale-owned parking 
lot. 
“You can see them keep moving down, keep mov-
ing, keep moving.” She waved a long-fingered hand at 
free-standing brownstones and half-boarded-up busi-
nesses. 
“Them,” for Slade and many other Dixwell residents, 
means Yale University. Dixwell has seen many changes 
in the past twenty years. In the past decade, as Yale has 
acquired properties in Dixwell and offered its employ-
ees financial incentives to move into New Haven, some 
Dixwell residents have felt as though Yale’s expansion 
benefits only the University.

Yale administrators are quick to point out that the 
University is New Haven’s largest employer, attracts 
millions of dollars worth of federal grants to the city 
each year, and has helped thousands of its employees 
buy their own homes in places like Dixwell through 
the Yale Homebuyer Program. 

The University has over forty major properties in 
the Dixwell neighborhood but few on Dixwell Avenue 
itself, one of which is a residence run through Elm 
Campus, a real estate company that works on behalf 
of the University. Both properties are situated near the 
center of campus, right at the junction of Downtown 
New Haven and Dixwell.
“They have the resources to do it. All they’ve got is 
money and time,” Slade said, referring to the Universi-
ty’s influence in Dixwell. “This all’s going to be ‘Yales-
ville’ real soon.”

I
nstead of the royal blue plaques that mark campus 
buildings, Yale’s presence in Dixwell has taken 
the form of the next-door neighbor. For example, 
Annette Tracey, who has worked in the Berkeley din-
ing hall for decades, now lives in Dixwell. She bought 
her home behind the Payne Whitney Gym through 
the Homebuyer Program, which was created in 1994 
to better integrate Yale with New Haven by partially 
subsidizing employees’ home purchases. 

Tracey’s house is just a few minutes’ walk from Dix-
well Avenue, which Slade calls  “a main artery” of 
the neighborhood. The street is also a dividing line 
between what residents consider the two sides of the 
neighborhood: “up-the-hill” (“all of that is Yale,” Slade 
said) and “down-the-hill” which remains mostly Black, 
filled with rental housing properties. Up-the-hill is in 
Ward 22, down-the-hill in Ward 2. 

According to the 2010 census, a little over 10,460 peo-
ple live in the half square mile that com-
prise the Dixwell neighborhood. Nearly 
sixty percent of Dixwell residents are 
Black. For comparison, the entire city of 
New Haven—nearly forty times the size 
of the neighborhood—has almost one 
hundred thirty thousand residents, only 
35.4 percent of whom are Black. 

A little further away from Dixwell 
Avenue, Prospect Street is growing into 
another artery in the neighborhood, one 
more populated by Yale buildings and 
students. There, on the southeast corner 
of up-the-hill Dixwell, Yale’s two newest 
residential colleges, Benjamin Franklin 
and Pauli Murray, opened this past fall 
to house two hundred new undergradu-
ate students. Many permanent residents 
of Dixwell believe the new colleges will 
widen economic disparities between sites 
of Yale’s interest in Dixwell and, in partic-
ular, down-the-hill. 

n the early two-thousands, the Univer-
sity began buying properties near the 
Grove Street Cemetery, which sits in 
the southeast corner of Dixwell. In 2002, 
Yale purchased a commercial laundry 
facility north of the cemetery. In 2006, the Rose Cen-
ter west of the cemetery opened on Ashmun Street, 
housing both the Yale Police Department and the 
Dixwell-Yale Community Learning Center. That same 
year, the University pledged half a million dollars to 
revitalize Scantlebury Park to the north, just months 
after paying the city ten million dollars to purchase 
adjacent land. 

In 2008, Yale publicly announced its plans to open 
two new residential colleges on that land. After a two 
hundred fifty million dollar gift from University alum-
nus Charles B. Johnson, the new colleges quickly took 
shape on lower Prospect Street, and are now part of the 
ebb and flow of daily campus life.

Planning for the colleges began in 2006 with an 
agreement between Yale and New Haven. After acquir-
ing the property for the new colleges, Yale worked 
closely with the city on zoning and mapping around 
the neighborhood, said Bruce Alexander, Yale’s Vice 
President for New Haven and State Affairs in a video-
taped press conference this past August.
“That was pretty good to get a unanimous vote out 
of the Board of Alders. That’s pretty hard to do in any 
event for almost anything,” he said. The vote in favor 
of this project in the board of alders was thirty to zero, 
he said. 

There had been speculation about plans to open new 
colleges since at least 2000, when an article published 
in the Yale Alumni Magazine by Mark Alden Branch 
said that the area to the north of the Grove Street 
Cemetery might be “sites for new buildings to further 
populate the area—perhaps the pair of new residential 
colleges that have long been discussed but that are not 
on the immediate horizon.”

John DeStefano, Jr., who served as the mayor of New 
Haven from 1994 to 2013, worked closely with former 
University President Richard Levin to develop the Uni-
versity’s real estate focus over those two decades. 
“[Yale] had a plan that was developed by the late 
nineteen-nineties to outline campus expansion, partic-
ularly northward movement,” he said.

The plan to which DeStefano alludes is the Univer-
sity’s Framework for Campus Planning, envisioned in 
1997 by New York-based architecture urban design firm 
Cooper, Robertson & Partners. The document, which 
was released to the public in 2000, outlines real estate 
and architectural plans to the north of the Grove Street 
Cemetery. In one map showing the areas around Yale, 
a sketch of future planning superimposes the word “res-
