Can a new coat of arms reflect changing times?

Hopper College’s coat of arms, featured on a 
plaque above the dining hall fireplace, is hard 
to miss. The marine emblem, striking in its yel-
low and blue, seems anachronistic; the coat of arms 
looks too new and polished to appear fully at home 
against the wood paneling, stained glass, and chande-
liers.


But this juxtaposition is not incidental. After Yale 
University decided to rename Calhoun College in 
honor of Grace Hopper in February 2017 and to open 
up two new residential colleges, Benjamin Franklin 
and Pauli Murray, it enlisted the Office of the Univer-
sity Printer to design new coats of arms. A little-known 
department, the Office is responsible for Yale’s visual 
identity, which, according to its website, “relies on the 
consistent and effective use of [Yale’s] branding touch-
stones.” Those touchstones include Yale’s logo, coat of 
arms, and typeface, all designed by an office of six but 
seen by millions.


School of Art graduate John Gambell, official Univer-
sity Printer and keeper of emblematic keys, described 
Yale’s visual branding as an asset that Yale entities use 
and return. “Every piece that comes out of Yale needs 
to be focused on an audience,” Gambell said, empha-
sizing that the graphics need to represent the culture of 
the university itself.


When Gambell began to design the new residen-
tial colleges’ coats of arms, his task was to both craft 
something new and pay homage to the old. In planning 
the Franklin design, Gambell initially hoped to utilize 
Benjamin Franklin’s family coat of arms, but found it 
was a “mishmash” of competing elements. “I looked at 
it, and it was not as good as any of the existing residen-
tial college coats of arms,” Gambell said. He began to 
draft a visual that would, somehow, reconcile the fig-
ure of Franklin as he appears in textbooks with a more 
modern “graphic dynamism.”


The Murray and Hopper coats of arms are similar 
tugs-of-war between past and present: Pauli Murray’s is 
inspired by elements of the Scottish Murray family coat 
of arms, while Hopper’s retains the colors of the former 
Calhoun coat of arms while adding a dolphin to repre-
sent Grace Hopper’s naval leadership. Some view the 
dolphin as representative of the new shields’ playful-
ness (“The humorous elements alone are a big break-
through,” said Hopper Head Julia Adams). This begs 
the question: As Yale situates itself in a more inclusive 
era, how much traditionalism is necessary for a living, 
breathing university?


The University developed its own coat of arms long 
before those of the colleges, and, as one might expect 
of a heraldic practice fighting for its life in a digital cen-
tury, the prominence of Yale’s coat of arms has dimin-
ished. The shield was derived from the Seal of Yale 
University and approved in the 1720s. It first appeared 
on Master’s Degree diplomas in 1749, when Ezra Stiles 
was President of the University. As a trademark, the 
coat of arms lost its brand-
ing pride of place in 2007, 
when former Yale Cor-
poration Secretary Linda 
Lorimer and former pres-
ident Rick Levin travelled 
to South and East Asia and 
found that Yale’s primary 
identifiers—the 
bulldog, 
the coat of arms—were not 
only unfamiliar but also 
alienating to the general public. 


The result was the development 
of Yale’s primary logo, the “Y.”


“We thought very hard about 
what heraldry represents, and 
it is very Eurocentric,” Gam-
bell said. “It was for people 
who were generally moneyed 
or had some military connec-
tion…There was a feeling that 
it’s probably appropriate for the 
general, international, broad 
audience, to really concentrate 
on our happy Y-A-L-E.”


And yet heraldry at Yale still flourishes in the residen-
tial college system—that much is apparent from college 
t-shirts and lanyards alone. Most of the colleges’ coats 
of arms were developed in 1953 by Theodore “Tubby” 
Sizer, former Yale professor and Art Gallery director, 
to liven up Yale ceremonies, and were based upon the 
familial coat of arms of each college’s namesake.


Perhaps as a result of the new insignias’ playful and 
subversive elements, many view them as a connecting 
force between the traditional, elitist “Old Yale” and the 
modern, progressive “New Yale.” For instance, Pauli 
Murray’s coat of arms has what heraldic language calls a 
“counterchanged circle” to represent her “transgressive 
gender expression,” according to the college’s website. 
Franklin Head Charles Bailyn called the emblems “a 
nice joining between ancient traditions of universities 
dating back a thousand years to our current place in 
the twenty-first century.” Murray Head Tina Lu echoed 
this sentiment, saying that a coat of arms is “an easy-on 
ramp to feeling like you belong to something that’s tra-
ditional” and stressed that the lighthearted use of the 
coat of arms—in t-shirts and temporary tattoos—links 
their traditional usage with a new era. 


For some, the appeal lies in the coats of arms’ aes-
thetic ties to Old Yale and their embrace of the univer-
sity’s pseudo-medieval identity. “I love how they look 
like they’re old, like they’ve always been in existence 
here,” said Franklin first-year Sylvia Kryszczuk.


But for Laura Maldonado-Rivera, a first-year in Pauli 
Murray, the coats of arms contradict the progress that 
the new colleges have made in rejecting some of Yale’s 
exclusive history. “I feel like the new colleges and 
Grace Hopper…should just embrace their new iden-
tity rather than try to even emulate the other colleges,” 
she said.


It’s possible that the coats of arms are meant as visual 
aids, a way to sustain the university as a symbolic, per-
haps literal, cohesive whole, to reconcile Old Yale 
and New Yale and still draw some kind of distinction 
between the two. But if a breakthrough is what was 
intended, Gambell’s task seems not only murky 
or paradoxical, but impossible—to design coats of 
arms that would fit neatly alongside their ancient, 
familial counterparts, blend into a residential col-
lege dining hall, and still symbolize progress.


Gambell himself acknowledged this tension. 
“It’s almost like the idea of having coat of arms is 
sort of de rigueur for universities,” he said. “Almost 
ironically, the idea of [a] coat of arms…[gives off] 
a ‘high-level’—some people would argue slightly 
elitist—kind of impression.” However, he argued 
that students can embrace or discard their residen-
tial college coats of arms, as their essential func-
tion is solely within the gates of Yale’s corporate 
structure.


“It’s sort of arbitrary,” Gambell said of the resi-
dential college coat of arms. Arbitrary, even as his 
office bustled around him, endeavoring to keep the 
New Yale, Y-A-L-E, alive while it maintains some 
of the Old. “Heaven knows they can be changed, 
one of these fine days,” he said, “if the spirit moves 
the right people.”
