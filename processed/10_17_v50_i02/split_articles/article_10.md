THE  NEW  JOURNAL
But Hickman finds other ways to help his clients. Start-
ing at one p.m. every day, Hickman and Raina Workman, 
the G.R.O.W.E.R.S. job coach, teach a combination of 
reading and life skill classes, designed so that their clients 
can be competitively employed and self-sufficient. The 
lessons range from plant identification and propagation to 
discussions of situational problem solving.


One Wednesday in September, Hickman conducted a 
discussion regarding bullying, with a focus on self-empow-
erment. “We sat and listened to the stories they had to deal 
with,” he said. “Even the quieter ones start speaking out 
after they see the others sharing.”


Hickman remains ardent about the program’s potential 
for building community among vulnerable populations 
even amidst funding difficulties. He wishes to expand the 
program, perhaps through a summer camp for disabled 
children in the greenhouse, with the participants acting 
as counselors. With a larger budget, he’d also love to start 
programs in retirement home complexes or transform 
abandoned greenhouses into storefronts. 


For now, on most days throughout the fall, Workman 
leads a reading group on Stephenie Meyer’s young adult 
series Twilight, the most common gift to the local dona-
tion boxes. Sitting next to several pots of yellow chrysan-
themums, the participants take turns reading, five lines at 
a time. They pause to discuss vocabulary like “prolong” 
and “unconditional.”


“If you’re religious, God’s love is unconditional,” 
Workman clarifies for the group. “Your human rights are 
unconditional.”
