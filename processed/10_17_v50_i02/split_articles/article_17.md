idential” over the area, although the buildings were, 
at the time, either vacant or unoccupied. Another part 
of the framework suggests that “joint efforts [between 
the city and the University] could make connections 
between Yale and the surrounding neighborhoods safer 
and more attractive.”
DeStefano knows this history first-hand. According to 
the Yale Alumni Magazine article, he suggested a joint 
project with Yale in the area. Lead architect of the firm 
Alexander Cooper is quoted in the article as saying, 
“The Mayor looked at the map and said that if you look 
at Yale as a clock, and if you observe that everywhere 
Yale goes, it improves the surrounding area, then what’s 
missing is the area from nine to twelve—the Dixwell 
neighborhood.”
“So although it was not directly articulated that way 
in any discussion I was ever in, there was a particular 
concern around edge neighborhoods around the cam-
pus,” he said. Dixwell was a target because campus 
expansion would “by definition” move into adjacent 
neighborhoods. 
“Before Yale built the residential colleges, it built 
the perimeter,” DeStefano said. 
T
his “perimeter” effect hasn’t only been around 
the expansion of the new colleges—it has filled 
home vacancies in neighborhoods adjacent to 
campus. The Yale Homebuyer Program assists in this 
mission by offering university employees grants of 
thirty thousand dollars over eleven years if they buy 
homes in East Rock, Beaver Hills, Wooster Square, 
Dixwell, Newhallville, Dwight, the Hill, Fair Haven, 
or West Rock. 
“The Yale Homebuyer program was created to 
encourage Yale staff and faculty to put down roots in 
New Haven and become part of the community,” wrote 
Karen King, a Community Affairs Associate with the 
Office of New Haven and State Affairs, in an email 
this month. “The Yale University Homebuyer Program 
strengthens [New Haven’s] tax base.”
Tom Conroy, Director of the University’s Office of 
Public Affairs & Communications, wrote in an email 
that the “Homebuyer Program is just one of the ways 
in which Yale contributes to the economic and social 
progress of New Haven,” also pointing to the New 
Haven Promise program. “Yale makes the largest vol-
untary payment of any university in the nation to any 
city in the nation,” he added. 


Forty-four of the program’s homebuyers work in ser-
vice and staff positions at the University and are mem-
bers of Local 34 and 35, according to Conroy. This 
is more than the percentage of both faculty and also 
professional staff who have bought homes through the 
program. Collectively, Yale employees have purchased 
homes with a total market value of approximately two 
hundred five million dollars. Yale has spent more than 
twenty-eight million dollars on the program since 1994. 
But since May 2002, in addition to the standard 
amount, the grant has included a five thousand dollar 
bonus in the first year for homebuyers in Dixwell—if 
they live up-the-hill. In fact, the description of the spe-
cial incentive essentially stipulates that all homes eligi-
ble for the benefit must be within the limits of Ward 22. 
This additional rebate was introduced six years before 
the official 2008 announcement that Yale would build 
new colleges on Prospect Street. 
According to research at DataHaven, the 06511 zip 
code—which includes Dwight, Beaver Hills, Dixwell, 
Newhallville, East Rock and Wooster Square—had 
a twenty-eight percent increase in home values from 
2004 to 2015, the largest in the state. The average sin-
gle-family home in 2015 was worth $75,908 more than 
it would have been in 2004. By contrast, values in other 
New Haven zip codes remained relatively flat.
“At what point does it inflate housing values?” DeSte-
fano asked. “You’re creating an artificial subsidy.” He 
paused. “One could suggest it is inflating values for 
other properties by introducing this subsidy that, if it 
wasn’t there, wouldn’t be elevating properties.”
Yet Conroy contends that the program and its Dix-
well-specific benefit is simply meant to “focus on the 
neighborhoods that would benefit from increased 
homeownership.”
“We certainly reject [the] contention that the Home-
buyer Program has been detrimental to Dixwell or any 
other eligible neighborhood,” he added.  
When pressed about why only Dixwell has a special 
incentive, Conroy said: “It exists to attract homebuyers, 
and if it helps a Yale employee decide to buy a home 
there rather than outside the the city, that’s good for 
New Haven.”
Although it would be impossible to frame the Home-
buyer Program as the primary cause of this increase in 
home value, Yale’s efforts to make New Haven more 
of a destination have undoubtedly impacted its hous-
ing market. Some people who have lived in Dixwell 
for decades are now moving out, unable to afford their 
rents or unsettled in a neighborhood that grows increas-

RESIDENTIAL COLLEGES, IT BUILT

ingly unfamiliar. 

S
lade remembers the Dixwell of the nineteen-sev-
enties as a vibrant and close-knit neighborhood.
“My grandma lived at 225 Ashmun in a high-
rise apartment building,” she said. “The place was 
immaculate. You could eat off the hallway floors. They 
called this ‘the projects,’ but we didn’t feel like we lived 
in the projects because it was community.”
World War I pumped capital into New Haven’s arms 
manufacturing sectors and the Great Migration brought 
Black southerners into northern cities. A popular com-
munity center called the Q House opened in 1924 on 
Dixwell Avenue, and historically Black churches like 
the Varick Memorial AME Zion Church, which was 
born in 1796 and officially established in 1820, dot the 
street. 

Dixwell also had a vibrant jazz culture. Every Friday 
and Saturday night, famous musicians stopped in the 
neighborhood on their way from New York to Boston, 
playing at famous jazz clubs like the Democratic Club, 
the Musician’s Club, and the Korners Club—all now 
boarded-up storefronts or delicatessens along Dixwell 
Avenue. Many elderly residents remember nights of 
dancing until sunrise or meeting some of the greatest 
musicians of the era in their own backyards. 

In the following decades, manufacturing began to 
decline and New Haven entered a period of steadily 
rising unemployment. In 1954, thirty-three percent of 
New Haven residents were employed by the indus-
try; by 1977, it was fourteen percent. White residents 
moved out to the suburbs and New Haven became 
a poorer, Blacker city, eventually becoming majority 
Black in 1990. 

Speaking about the seventies and eighties, Slade 
began walking faster up Dixwell Ave., running her 
thumb quickly back and forth over her knuckles. She 
had spent time in the Elm Haven Housing Projects, 
which were managed by the New Haven Housing 
Authority. In the eighties, she witnessed the dramatic 
reduction of essential city services like neighborhood 
maintenance and policing. 

“At the same time, New Haven is flooded with drugs, 
and employment opportunities dry up,” she said. 
“These factors fertilize a breeding ground of decay and 
brokenness.”
During the War on Drugs, reports of violent crime 
increased dramatically. In 1960, there were 64.5 crimes 
per hundred-thousand; in 1970, there were four hun-
dred; in 1980, there were over one thousand five hun-
dred. According to research from the Yale Law School, 
the New Haven Police Department responded with 
brutal force, deploying a “beat down posse”—a street 
unit that focused on eradicating drug crime—mostly 
comprised of white officers. This group would bring 
dogs and white vans to Dixwell, targeting Black men 
and often arresting them on low-level drug offenses.
By the nineteen-nineties, New Haven was at its most 
economically desolate. In 1994, the same year that the 
Homebuyer Program started, GQ magazine published 
an enormous, inflammatory piece called “The Last 
Boola Boola,” describing New Haven as a “war zone of 
poverty, crime, and drugs as frightening as any Amer-
ican city.” In 1991, crime in New Haven touched the 
Yale community with the murder of Christian Prince, a 
student who was shot on Hillhouse Avenue.
DeStefano remembers “an extraordinarily large 
number of vacant properties” during those years. He 
said there was a  strong desire on the part of both the 
city and the University to create the Homebuyer’s Pro-
gram, which would hopefully make city blocks safer, 
cleaner, and more inhabited.  
“Good things don’t happen in vacant buildings,” he 
said.
Slade paused, looking down Foote Street towards 
Ashmun, where her grandmother’s apartment building 
used to be. Then she turned to walk up Dixwell again. 
She remembered cuts to affordable housing programs, 
cuts to art programs in schools, and cuts to library bud-
gets.
“You cut all that and then you make people live 
like animals. And only then do you ask, ‘What’s wrong 
with these people?’ What sent people out initially was 
just pure neglect,” Slade said, walking in silence for a 
while. “By the time the nineties came around, nobody 
wanted to be here. Would you?”

CAME AROUND, NOBODY 
WANTED TO BE HERE. WOULD 
YOU?”

Since the nineteen-nineties, crime, particularly in 
the areas of New Haven that surround Yale, has 
declined. Nationally, the economy has improved. 
From the perspective of Richard Cleary, a white resi-
dent who has lived on Mansfield Street in up-the-hill 
Dixwell since 1979, Yale’s involvement in the neighbor-
hood has yielded only positive effects.
Cleary served as a civil engineer for years and lives 
in the upstairs apartment of a two-story home with a 
turquoise porch and tiled floors. “The street’s gone up 
and down,” he said. “Right now, it’s quite good. And 
of course, one of the reasons is that Yale has security 
types, uniformed security types around here.”
 Cleary lived on Mansfield Street in the eighties 
and nineties, back when city residents called it “Man-
slaughter Street.” Cleary recounted an assault when he 
ran out to the street to protect his downstairs neighbor 
from a violent mugging. Now, he said, he feels much 
safer.
 Over the years, Yale has paid special attention to 
Mansfield Street, which DeStefano called “clearly 
an edge street.” According to the website of Yale real 
estate company Elm Campus Partners, there are twen-
ty-seven Yale-owned houses and rental  apartments 
on that street, mostly populated by graduate students. 
These properties join the commercial holdings at Lake 
Place and Dixwell Avenue, the Rose Center housing 
the Yale Police Department and Yale Health, and the 
new residential colleges. Altogether, it’s over forty real 
estate holdings. 

 DeStefano laughed dismissively at the implication 
of a causal relationship between Yale’s real estate devel-
opment the area’s declining rate of crime.“It’s not like 
Yale bought some houses on Mansfield Street and the 
freaking crime rate dropped,” he said. “There’s a lot 
more going on than that.”
Cleary welcomes the increased presence of law 
enforcement officers. “It’s basically crime-free now,” 
he said.
 Although he had not heard of the Dixwell-specific 
incentive, he knew of the Homebuyer Program. “Of 
course the University would want to have a solid neigh-
borhood,” he said. “They’d want a border or a periph-
ery around campus. Why? It’s so obvious. Why do you 
not want to be hit over the head? Why would you not 
want your students and employees to be safe?” 

A
lder Jeanette Morrison, who has represented 
New Haven’s Ward 22 since 2011, oversees all 
the parts of Dixwell covered by the extra rebate. 
Before the construction of the Pauli Murray and Benja-
min Franklin, Ward 22 already housed four residential 
colleges: Ezra Stiles and Morse to the West and Timo-
thy Dwight to the East. The new colleges on Prospect 
Street will pump more than six hundred voters into the 
existing three thousand currently living in Ward 22, 
transitioning the electorate from majority permanent 
city residents to a constituency split between the two 
populations: students and permanent residents. Yale 
votes are becoming a greater component of Ward 22 
votes, influencing up-the-hill Dixwell. As more stu-
dents in the new colleges register to vote, this tilt will 
only continue.
Today, almost thirty years after the devastation of 
the nineties, vacancy is no longer a glaring problem in 
New Haven housing. In fact, according to real estate 
research firm Reis Inc., New Haven had the lowest 
apartment vacancy rate in the nation at 2.1 percent, 
beating out the notoriously oversaturated New York 
City housing market’s 2.4 percent vacancy rate. Fewer 
vacant apartments in New Haven drove up housing 
prices, pushing low-income residents into more expen-
sive rentals or neighboring towns like Hamden or 
Bridgeport. Now, the issue isn’t vacancy. It’s the lack of 
affordable housing, pricing residents out of rentals and, 
as a result, out of Dixwell. 

 According to a 2016 Brookings Institution study of 
inequality in cities, New Haven was sixth on the list of 
all U.S. cities with the greatest gap between the richest 
and the poorest. In New Haven, the top earners had 
15.3 times the income of the poorest residents. That
