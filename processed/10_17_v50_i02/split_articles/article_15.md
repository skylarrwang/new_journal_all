EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
funerary wheat pudding adorned with raisins in the shape 
of a cross. On the suggestion of Kum Greg, my honorary 
uncle, he, my father, my Uncle Ken, and I each filled 
a shot glass of sljivovica and walked back to the grave. 
Because my father is Muslim and does not drink, it was 
his job to pour his glass over the casket. The rest of us 
drank ours.

My grandfather is dead, and cannot drink. He is drink-
ing sljivovica in heaven, Kum Greg said, with the war-
rior Drazha Mihaijlovic and the warrior-king Karadjordje 
Petrovic and the poet-king Petar Petrovic Njegos. Perhaps 
they are sitting in a valley between two jagged Montene-
grin peaks, listening to the poems of a guslar and his one-stringed lute drift over the hills. Here, in Libertyville, the 
songs are those of cicadas. They are singing because the 
sun is out.
