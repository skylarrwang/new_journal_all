has undergone a neatly modern, Cartesian 
inversion: giving your brain to science, in 
return for temporary and mediocre treat-
ment. 

But providing a steady output of use-
ful research findings may, paradoxically, be 
the only viable lifeline for mental health 
facilities whose funding is always under fire 
by compassionate conservatives and critics 
of state-funded health care. New York 
Governor George Pataki drew some criti-
cism and more commendation in 1997 after 
announcing his plan to reduce funds for 
outpatient mental health care. 
His 
Republican 
colleague, 
Connecticut 
Governor John Rowland, scrapped two 
state-run mental health hospitals in 1997, 
leaving only one in operation, and cut 
funds by another five percent in 1999. 
Meanwhile, the Northwest Center for 
Family Service and Mental Health in 
Litchfield, Connecticut, facing lowered 
funding and job layoffs, invited Meryl 
Streep and Sam Waterston to perform a 
brief skit for a fundraising benefit 
{Waterston played the director Â·of a mental 
health center whose job pulls him in too 
many directions). In the face of a facility's 
tenuous suppon from lawmakers and pal-
try funding from skeptical or recalcitrant 
state governments, what can its staff do but 
use its many patients as a commodity? 

Still, the most optimistic of us have 
reason for hope. It appears that, however 
slowly, the decades-old cries of mental 
health advocates may finally be heard. 
Shortly after New Haven was chosen as one 
of 54 cities nationwide to share in the fed-
erally-funded 
Safe 
Schools/Healthy 
Students grants, the city announced plans 
to use pan of a three-year, $2.8 million 
grant to hire more mental health profes-
sionals, while a similar resolution was made 
in neighboring Waterbury. In the spirit of 
recent calJs for a national patients' bill of 
rights, Connecticut state legislators--much 
to the consternation ofHMo's--have begun 
debating proposals that would force insur-
ance companies to pay for mental health 
treatment. Perhaps in the future, the ugly 
and persistent reality of the mentally ill, 
ignored and wished away by the American 
OcrosER 15, 1999 
public for so long, will indeed be treated in 
the same manner as the "conventionally" 
ill. We can certainly neglect the problem no 
longer. As Jon Oldfield, an advocate for the 
mentally ill, states, "This issue of money is 
simply going to get someone hun." 

One thinks of Freud's lectures during 
his first visit to the United States in 1909, 
when he delivered five extemporaneous 
talks on the foundations of psychoanalysis 
at 
Clark 
University 
in 
Worcester, 
Massachusetts. In the course of his first lec-
ture, Freud expounded upon some of the 
difficulties facing any physician who seeks 
to treat illnesses of the mind: 

But all [the conventional doctor's] 
knowledge-his training in anatomy, in 
physiology and in pathology--leaves him 
in the lurch when he is confronted by the 
details of hysterical phenomena. He can-
not understand hysteria, and in the &.ce of 
it he is himself a layman ... So it comes 
about that hysterical patients forfeit his 
sympathy. He regards them as people who 
are transgressing the laws of his science-
like heretics in the eyes of the orthodox. 
He attributes every lcind of wickedness to 
them, accuses them of exaggeration, of 
deliberate deceit, of malingering. And he 
punishes them by withdrawing his interest 
from them. 

Despite being nearly a century old, 
Freud's words resonate in the claims of 
individuals and groups who continue to 
insist that mental illness is a private, even 
overdiscussed worry, and one that should 
remain safdy out of the hands of govern-
ment and its clinical employees. We can 
wonder how many more guns will have to 
go off in schools, or in daycare centers, or 
in daytrading offices, before something is 
done. Or, as seen in the case of Kelly Silk, 
we can choose to do nothing. We can defer 
the conversation indefinitely. We can con-
tinue using prisons as health facilities and 
health facilities as prisons. In other words, 
we can play the fiddle like Nero; we can 
debate the merits of government interven-
tion and freedom, all while the house slow-
ly burns.
