Phone Home 
With a new coat of baby blue paint on the 
living room walls, all looks well in a house 
on Crown Street occupied by five friends. 
It takes time to notice one peculiarity: the 
inordinate number of power sockets in the 
house--16 in the living room alone. In the 
basement, there is a phone board with 14 
phone lines, with names such as Ed, Poky 
and Clam scribbled on it as well as the 
cryptic phrase, "Nice job, Cush." 

"I personally think the house was 
something ... fascinating,'' says current resi-
dent Brian Mullin (oc 'm). 

Alexandra Cox (BK 'm), also a resi-
dent, heard something more definite. 
"People have come up to me and said, 'I 
heard your house was a brothel.'" Cox also 
noted that when she called SNET about 
their phone service, they told her that the 
house's account was tremendously long-
536 pages to be exact. Mullin speculated 
that the house may have been used for 
phone sex. 

This year's residents are not the first 
Yalies to live in the two-story white house. 
Students have lived there for the past four 
or five years, according to the house's land-
lord Frank Maselli. However, last year's res-
idents never heard any rumors about the 
possibility of the home being a brothel. 
Dargie Anderson (BR 'oo) thought the 
house had been an office, and Ellen 
Gilman (sR 'oo) heard it was a nursery. 

In December of 1991, Maselli bought 
the house along with the neighboring 
property, which now houses his auto care 
shop. At the time, Yale's School of 
Epidemiology and Public Health (EP&H) 
was renting the house. According to 
Maselli, EP&H soon outgrew the building 
and moved out about a year after he 
acquired it. 

Roberta MarineUa, who has worked in 
the epidemiology business office since 1988, 
confirmed that her department had used 
the house and moved out a few years later. 
"We rent off-campus space for some 
non-lab 
research, 
conducting phone 
research and surveys," says Marinella. The 
particular house on Crown Street was used 
to call pregnant women and ask them 
about their habits with regard to alcohol 
and caffeine., with the go~ of documenting 
the brutal effect of these habits on their 
babies. In other words, they made good use 
of 14 phone lines without ever once having 

So: case closed? 

"Yeah, it was a whorehouse," says 
"John," an employee of Yale University 
Dining Services. "Let's just say, if you had 
some ladies, and you needed a place, that 
house was somewhere you could go." 

Yale students did not move in until at 
least the fall of 1995, leaving four years 
unaccounted for. 

But if it was a brothel, it certainly was 
a quiet one. During the four-year period, 
the New Haven police were called to the 
house only once. In the middle of a March 
night in 1995, someone had tried to remove 
the front stairs of the house. According to 
the police report, the suspect tried to move 
the stairs so that he could remove -a vehicle 
that had been towed earlier that day by 
Maselli's business. 

Whether or not prostitutes frequented 
the house on Crown Street is unclear. But 
what is clear is that whatever did happen 
was certainly weird.
