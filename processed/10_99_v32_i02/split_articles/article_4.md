High and Dry 
In the early morning ofTuesday, August 31, 
Richard Guy, a physics major at the 
MassachusettS Institute ofTechnology, was 
found dead in a friend's dorm room. Guy 
had been inhaling nitrous oxide from a 
garbage bag when he passed out and feU 
face first into the bag. After continuously 
breathing in pure nitrous oxide for several 
minutes, he asphyxiated himself and died. 
The two friends with whom Guy spent 
that morning--one an MIT senior and the 
other a recent graduate--currently face 
charges of possession with intent to distrib-
ute marijuana, amphetamines, psilocybin 
mushrooms and nitrous oxide. These 
charges could land them in prison for the 
better part of their lives. 

In the wake of Guy's death, controver-
sy has ensued in Cambridge. 
In "oAMJT-Orugs at MIT," a pam-
phlet published and distributed on the MIT 
campus shortly after Guy's death, an 
anonymous author decried MIT's drug pol-
icy and called for a new awareness of stu-
dent drug use and the creation of an open 
dialogue on the subject. Citing a recent 
case in which a student was left uncon-
scious at the emergency room door by stu-
dents fearing repercussions from university 
authorities, the author writes, "Neither of 
these events should ever have occurred-
people need to know how to be safe if they 
choose to use recreational drugs, and peo-
ple need to not fear legal repercussions if 
they're saving the life of someone in dan-
ger." The author goes on to detail the 
chemistry, effects and dangers of the most 
commonly-used recreational drugs, rang-
ing from cocaine to cough syrup. 

The events at MIT reflect a drug policy 
debate that is raging on college campuses 
across the country. At Yale, however, that 
debate appears to be virtually nonexistent. 
The absence of dialogue on the issue is all 
the more troubling in light of the 
University's liberal and open approach to 
alcohol use and abuse. 

The contrast is most evident in the 
curriculum of the freshman orientation 
program given to every Yale student upon 
arrival in New Haven. During the first days 
of school, in the midst of nightly fraternity 
parties and widespread binge-drinking, 
every freshman sits down with other stu-
dents and spends several hours listening to 
their counselors, security officials, peer 
educators and various other arbiters of their 
innards. The most prominent aspect of this 
curriculum is alcohol. 

Yale avoids preaching about University 
policy and focuses on trying to promote 
safety and responsibility when students 
drink. Binge drinking, date-rape and alco-
hol poisoning are included with various 
other alcohol-related issues. Counselors 
and other officials continually emphasize 
that there is little reason to fear disciplinary 
action by the University if a student drinks 
responsibly. This virtual immunity even 
extends to students who are taken to 
University Health Services because of over-
consumption. 

This tacit approval of alcohol con-
sumption, and even occasional over-con-
sumption, comes as no surprise. Drinking 
is ingrained in the very fabric of Yale life, 
from social-drinking on the weekends to 
Tang, Mory's and other classic, uue-blue 
traditions. The University's realization that 
students will drink regardless of rules 
allows for a constructive dialogue which 
transforms the issue from a legal one to a 
medical one. Policy is designed according-
ly, aimed at promoting responsibility and 
ensuring the safety of students who drink. 

Yet even a well-informed freshman 
counselor had little to say on the topic of 
drugs. It was absent from the mandatory 
orientation programming, with the excep-
tion of a list of Connecticut drug laws in a 
xeroxed 
packet. 
The 
Und~rgraduate 
&grtlations say nothing about illegal drugs 
other than that "the unlawful possession, 
use, or distribution of illicit drugs on 
University property or as part of any 
University activity is prohibited." 

Obviously, these materials educate 
freshmen in neither the health-related nor 
disciplinary consequences of drug use at 
Yale. Questions such as how a student is 
treated if taken to UHS for a drug overdose 
were never even brought up, let alone 
answered-and ignorance of these issues 
can only lead to problems. 

Despite the unbalanced treatment of 
alcohol and other drugs in freshman orien-
tation, University officials take similarly 
liberal, medically-oriented stances. "Our 
concern is with the health of the students 
and it is the same with drugs as it is with 
alcohol," said Dean of Student Affairs 
Betty Trachtenberg. "If a student has a drug 
overdose and is taken to the hospital, the 
main concern is with the health of the stu-
dent-same thing with alcohol." While 
Trachtenberg recognized the legal impHca-
tions of drug use, she continually empha-
sized that the University's policy on drugs 
focused more on the student's well-being 
than on punishment. "It's a grave health 
issue, and it's a grave legal issue, but we are 
not running a police state." Unfortunately, 
the benefits of this approach to drug use 
lose their effectiveness when virtually no 
one knows the policy. In the eyes of stu-
dents, the omission of drugs from the ori-
entation program implies a forbidden sta-
tus, forcing the issue out of the realm of 
open dialogue. 

Little will come of the University's 
drug policy if it remains veiled in secrecy; 
omitted from orientation programming as 
if taboo. As events on coUege campuses 
across the nation have shown, draconian 
drug policies and srudent ignorance do 
very little in the way of prevention or safe-
ty. For Yale students, a liberal underlying 
policy is in place. Unfortunately, only 
University officials seems to know that. 


**Title: A Spiral in Time**
**Author: Sydney uavms**

A Spiral in Time 
Freshman year, Andy Simon (BK 'oo) wrote 
an EngHsh paper that became an analysis of 
the author's geometry of time. A budding 
math major, he realized that all of his class-
es, regardless of subject matter, were varia-
tions on one theme. He and roommate 
Teru Thomas (BK 'oo) likened the unpre-
dictable, yet steady patterns formed by 
their education at Yale to the spiraling of a 
solenoid-the geometric shape of a slinky. 
"We had no idea what shape our revolu-
tions would take, just that we had to keep 
the wheels turning," Sinton explained. 

Their sophomore year, as items were 
moved from Berkeley to Swing Space in 
preparation for the college's renovation, 
Sinton and Thomas found an old Berkeley 
printing press block with tablet type placed 
to read Spira~ Lucis 
~ritatis, Sodalitas 
So/enadiorum Colkgii &rltkiani, or "The 
Spiral of Light and Truth, The Berkeley 
Solenoid Society." Finding no official 
documentation of 
its 
existence 
in 
Berkeley College 
records, let alone 
any indication as to 
what 
the 
Solenoid 
Society was, they sur-
mised only that members 
must have sought truth out-
side the Yale curriculum's offer* 
ings. 

The new Berkeley Solenoid 
Society continues the tradition of provid-
ing a forum for students and faculty to dis-
cuss interestS they pursue outside of class. 
In an armosphere very much like that of a 
master's tea, and indeed sometimes unin-
tentionally catered by Yale dining ser-
vices-like when members swiped brie 
from the Berkeley rededication ceremo-
ny--guest speakers discuss whatever inter-
ests them, ranging from international poli-
tics to the physiology of scuba diving. 

Other eventS include Yale's largest indepen-
dent student art show and the society's 
trademark: Thursday games of midnight 
croquet. 

"The game has no rules," said Ashley 
Adams (BK 'oo), the society's Director of 
Spacial Manipulations. "You're supposed to 
play it, but it's more about the conversa-
tions than about winning or losing." The 
unstructured aspect of the game became a 
problem last year in determining the out-
come of the society's one "away" game. In a 
less 
publicized 
and 
much 
darker 
Harvard-Yale game against the crimson 
â€¢Mr. J's Midnight Croquet," each team 
claimed victory. Thomas won the game, 
but the Cantabs boasted greater all around 
strength. Sinton shrugged. "It was an ill-
defined game," he said. 

In its search for other opponents, the 
Berkeley Solenoid Society has come up 
shon. While the Elizabethan Club is reput-
ed to play a fierce game, their style of cro-
quet might not mesh well with the late 
hours and makeshift course of the Berkeley 
team. And the Solenoid Society is not pre-
pared to compromise. Between the hour!> 
of twelve and one on Thursday night-
Friday morning-participating 
members do more than 
complete a game of 
croquet. "Our course 
is more solenoidal," 
Sinton explained. 
"Every week we 
complete one cycle 
in the infinite sole-
noid of life." 

Last year, Sinton 
and Thomas did not miss 
a game, braving blustery 
New Haven winters, late-night 
downpours, and even some less-than-nat-
ural disasters. There was, as Sinton told me 
proudly, the occasional bitter cold night 
when the hearty mallet-wielding games-
men were accosted by sprinklers. They 
played every time, though Thomas did 
admit that such obstacles gave new mean-
ing to success in croquet. "Basically, it 
meant we didn't stumble or pass out," he 
said. 

The core members of the Solenoid 
Society-Adams; Thomas, the Society's 
Moral Conscience; Sinton, the Director of 
Revolution; Chris Hillar, the Director of 
Mathematical Proof; and Andrew Faehnle, 
the Director of General Mischief-are 
Berkeley seniors, and thus far no one has 
stepped up to fill their shoes. But the 
Berkeley Solenoid Society, according to 
Sinton and Thomas, transcends time. 
Decades from now someone might learn of 
its existence, and reestablish it just as they 
did two years ago. And the possible break 
in the weekly croquet schedule? Not a con-
cern. As Sinton pointed out, "The 
Solenoid Society doesn't need to manifest 
itself in croquet. It just does for us."
