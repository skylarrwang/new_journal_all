directing Safe Night, a 
crime prevention program 
held at the park. Townsend, 
who held a permit for the event, 
ejected Newton from the park 
with the aid of three New Haven 
Police 
officers, 
charging 
that 
Newton was campaigning at a family 
event. 

I asked Newton if he thought 
DeStefano was directly bdllnd the closing 
of Negroni's food bank. "Absolutely," 
Newton replied, "no question about it." 
Newton is convinced that he has been vic-
timized. I asked Newton if he thought 
DeStefano was directly behind the incident 
at Safe Night: "Absolutely. It is unfortunate 
that this administration is so vindictive. I 
think that's horrible." 

Newton has a tendency to see 
DeStefano behind all of his campaign's set-
backs. But he has also made some costly 
mistakes of his own. Newton chose Patricia 
Cofrancesco as his running mate; she is 
vying for the position of City Clerk. A for-
mer top lawyer in the DeStefano adminis-
tration, Cofrancesco ~as forced by the 
Mayor to resign on June 18, 1998. 

Cofrancesco lost her Job after tenuously 
ruling that a loan was ethical. The loan was 
given by the city of New Haven to Andrea 
Jackson-Brooks: Mayor DeStefano's top 
aide. Jackson-Brooks received a zero-inter-
est, half-forgiven loan to remove lead paint 
from her house. The loan-in the amount 
of S58,75o--was given through a federally 
funded program known as HOME. Jackson-
Brooks' salary, $72,100 a year, disqualified 
her from applying for a loan from HOMl!. 
Furthermore, Jackson-Brooks already had 
two other mortgages on the house, mort-
gages 
with 
an aggregate value of 
$102,00<>--$12,000 more than the estimat-
ed value of the house. 

Clearly this loan was an embarrass-
ment to DeStefano when it was brought to 
the public attention in an Ad110cate article 
in June 1998. In an effort to make amends 
for the scandal, DeStefano needed scape-
goats: Jackson-Brooks and Cofrancesco 
found themselves unemployed. Although 
she resigned from her position in accor-
dance 
DeStefano's 
wishes, 
Cofrancesco was not pleased about taking 
the fall for the mayor. On the contrary, 
later in July Cofrancesco took DeStefano to 
22 
New Haven 
Superior Court. 

In an attempt to get 
her job back, Cofrancesco 
claimed that she was forced to quit by the 
Mayor, who physically intimidated her into 
resigning. In the July trial Cofrancesco 
attempted to prove this physical intimida-
tion, which allegedly occurred during a 
five-minute meeting in the Mayor's office, 
in order to be reinstated in her former posi-
tion. As Ad110cau reporter Colleen Van 
Tassell 
quipped, 
"Evidently 
she 
[Cofrancesco] wants to return to an envi-
ronment where she feels unsafe around the 
mayor and scapegoated by co-workers." 

Cofrancesco thus brings to the 
Newton ticket all the anti-DeStefano ire 
one could hope to muster. But is Newton 
so intoxicated by Cofrancesco's sour grapes 
that be can forgive her role in DeStefano's 
corruption? What is even more confusing 
about 
Newton's 
affiliation 
Cofrancesco is that the Jackson-Brooks 
case was not the first time she offered the 
mayor the shaky legal advice he needed to 
bend the rules. She also did it in 1996-for 
the Fusco corporation. In 1994. Mayor 
DeStefano gave the Fusco family a private 
contract to maintain City Hall in a surrep-
titious manner later criticized by the Board 
of Aldermen. In 1996, DeStefano gave the 
Fuscos control over the cleaning of the city 
office building at 200 Orange Street. 

DeStefano only dared to increase Fusco's 
contract because of the legal safety net pro-
vided for hlm by his top legal advisor: 
Patricia Cofrancesco. 

When I asked him why he chose 
Cofrancesco, Newton paused and then 
began defending her. But just for a second, 
for the first time in our meeting, Newton 
did not have the answer on the tip of his 
tongue. Newton defended his running 
mate, calling her "incredibly honest" and 
"a legal expert." Once again, Newton 
quickly pinned the blame on DeStefano, 
asserting that Cofrancesco was "manipu-
lated for the Mayor's purposes," in an 
administration where "if the Mayor 
doesn't like you, he chops your head 
off." 

May brought a second mani-
festation of Newton's political 
inexperience. Newton and cam-
paign manager Jason Bartlett were 
at New Haven radio station WEU, 
dropping off a press release. Hearing 
that Newton was in the office, Roger 
Vann and Tom Scott, the hosts of WEu's 
"Off Center," asked Newton to join them 
on the air. According to Paul Bass, who 
later wrote a story about Newton's 
imprompru radio visit for the Advocau, 
Vann and Scott were dying for him to 
attack DeStefano. Accordingly, they gave 
Newton a loaded gun. The first (and last) 
question they asked regarded DeStefano's 
proposed pay raise, which would raise the 
Mayor's salary to S97,603-the raise would 
also be the Mayor's third pay hike in four 
years. Newton shot himself in the foot. He 
approved of the pay raise, saying that the 
Mayor works hard. The following day, 
according to Bass, Newton called "Off 
Center" to "clarify" his position. His posi-
tion, he stated after sleeping on it, is that 
the Mayor should not get a raise. 

Perhaps Newton's gaffe can easily be 
explained: he needs the money. Although 
he has managed to raise s4o,ooo and has 
donated $19,000 of his own money to his 
campaign, his war chest is a bread box 
compared to DeStefano's. Thus what is left
