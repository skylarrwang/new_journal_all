Analyze This

Three days later, Kelly Silk, 32 and a mother of four living in 
East Hartford, stabbed her husband and eight-year-old daughter in 
the early hours of the morning. After killing her hus-
band with a kitchen knife, Silk set fire to the house's sec-
ond story with lawn-mower gasoline taken from the 
garage. Two children-a son and a daughter, aged two 
and three years old, respectively--died in their beds 
from smoke inhalation. The eight-year-old, Jessica, ran 
out of the house and to a neighbor's home with her hair 
on fire and her body dripping blood. Mrs. Silk was 
found the next' day among the home's smoldering 
remains, dead of third-degree burns and smoke inhala-
tion. 
Jessica and Joshua-the Silks' six-month-old new-
born-were hospitalized for burns and said to be in crit-
ical condition, but doctors expected both to live. As for 
their mother, police officials later said that Mrs. Silk had 
been hospitalized the previous year after an overdose of 
Prozac. Neighbors and members of the nearby Truth 
Baptist Church apparently did not know much of the 
family's day-to-day life. What the Hartford Police 
Department did know, however, was that Silk had had a 
history of mental problems, that she may have suffered 
from postpartum depression after giving birth to her 
fourth child, and that she was currently without any 
form of mental health care. 


Mental health, it seems, is very much on the collective brains 
of both policy makers and ordinary citizens these days. After 
Littleton, and a wave of shootings by gunmen young and old in 
Atlanta, Jonesboro, and Conyers, elected officials are finally starting 
to talk about preventative measures. And the solution that people 
are suggesting-increased governmental funding for the treatment 
of mental illness-has, over the course of the past four decades, 
slowly become more or less acceptable to the country that contin-
ued to detain its mentally ill in prisons only a hundred years ago. 

D uring a recent White House press conference, a teary-eyed 
Bill Clinton announced to the world that mental illness was 
no longer the social stigma it had been seen as for centuries. 
Standing beside the First Lady, looking both concerned and deter-
mined for the sea of reporters before him, Clinton convened the 
first-ever White House conference on mental health with a surpris-
ing call to action. "It is high time that our health plans treat all 
Americans equally," the President declared. "Government can and 
must lead the way to meet this challenge." Looking similarly tender, 
Mrs. Clinton seconded her husband's call, and urged insurance 
companies nationwide to offer mental health coverage equal to the 
provisions made for all other types of illness. "We must do whatev-
er it takes," she avowed boldly-and with those firm if somewhat 
vague words, the day-long conference, chaired by Tipper Gore, 
began happily. During the course of the day's deliberations, Gore 
herself was to admit that she had been treated for depression some 
ten years ago. 

With the advent of antipsychotic medications, state-managed 
mental hospitals, and cornmuniry groups all calling for improved 
care in the last forty years, it would seem that the quality of life of 
the estimated two to three million people diagnosed with serious 
mental illnesses would have improved drastically from the days of 
Dorothea Dix and the imagery of Oru Fkw Ovn- th~ Cue/too's N~st. 
Yet as mental health advocates and critics will admit, services for 
mentally ill persons without the abiliry to pay for hundred-dollar 
sessions every week are disastrous by any measure. Despite the $20 
billion in public funds spent every year on mental health services, 
more than half a million people remain untreated every year-in 
prisons, in boarding homes, on the street, in the average suburb and 
in substandard housing projectS. A Congressional report issued in 
1998 found that at least 2.4 people died and nearly 1,000 were 
injured or abused after being restrained at state-run mental health 
facilities. Paradoxically-even with the sometimes abominable 
treatment patients receive--the mentally ill have to fight tooth and 
nail even for admittance to these facilities, there being room for 
only some 70,000 people nationwide to receive inpatient care. 
Complicating matters further is the whopping 40 percent of the 
nation's prison population who have a history of mental illness, up 
drastically from 24 percent in 1991. 

Statewide, Connecticut has, at least on paper, historically fared 
and performed well in its treatment of the mentally ill. A 1990 
report published by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill 
(NAMI) rated Connecticut fourth in the nation for its care of the 
seriously ill, and praised the "exceptional leadership" of the state's 
Department of Mental Health. Yale's Child Study Center and vari-
ous psychiatric institutes regularly receive multimillion-dollar 
grants for their breakthrough research. But the state has also fallen 
prey to criticism in recent years, especially for the budget cuts of 
Governor John Rowland's administration. In June, Connecticut 
State corrections officers called for another look at the treatment of 
mentally iU prisoners after one inmate was killed while being over-
tranquilized by guards. Two prison suicides in ten days prompted 
the resignation of a top-level mental health supervisor and a policy 
review by the University of Connecticut Health Center. In 1999 
alone, three mentally ill prison inmates have committed suicide; at 
least that many have tried to kill themselves. Unsurprisingly, the 
condition of mental health care in Connecticut, and specifically 
that of New Haven, serves nicely as a microcosm of the nationwide 
picture. 

New Haven, as its residents and officials have known for quite 
some time now, is a city with an essentially schizophrenic personal-
ity, having a clearly defined boundary between the afBuent Yale 
campus and the depressed periphery. Perhaps, then, it should come 
as no surprise that the Elm City has been so frequently used as a 
case study by mental health experts. A curious observer visiting 
New Haven to inspect mental health facilities would learn, for 
instance, that the city known more for its supposed invention of the 
American pizza also has the nation's highest population of mental 
health professionals per capita in the country. A simple glance at the 
stretch of offices on Trumbull and Orange Streets, or at the count-
less facilities at Yale devoted to psychological and psychiatric 
research, will serve as further evidence of the many services provid-
ed to those who can pay for their treatment, or who can serve as 
participants in studies. For the insured, the New Haven YeUow 
Pages lists some 70 private psychiatric offices that charge anywhere 
from $75 to $350 an hour for private therapy. For those affiHated 
with Yale or Yale-sponsored studies, there is the Yale Psychiatric 
Institute, the Yale Child Study Center, Yale-New Haven Hospital, 
Mental Hygiene, the Department of Psychology, the Yale Center for 
Eating and Weight Disorders, the Yale Psychological Services Clinic 
and the Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy. For 
those with a taste for Freud, Jung and Adler, there is the Western 
New England Psychoanalytic lnstirute. Academics can peruse the 
Yale-published &vi~ of Gmn-al Psycho/Qgy, the jounull of Soci4/ 
Aycho/Qgy, or ImAgination, Cognition, Pn-sonality. But for the poor, 
the uninsured, and the seemingly countless homeless and addicted 
persons without the ability to pay-the detritus of the mental 
health industry-there is only one resource: the Connecticut 
Mental Health Center (CMHC). 

CMHC was founded in New Haven in 1966, shortly afrer the 
formative years of the city's mental health industry, when Yale's early 
leadership during the 194o's and 50's paved the way for better psy-
chiatric services both city- and nationwide. One of 18 Local Mental 
Health Authorities across the state, CMHC is a State of Connecticut 
facility-officially under the auspices of the Department of Mental 
Health and Addiction Services-staffed jointly between the gradu-
ate and professional branches of the Yale Department of Psychiatry 
and the state commission. From its run-down brick building on 
Park Street, adjacent to the significantly more attractive Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, CMHC handles those patients without the privilege 
and means co pay for their own mental healthcare: the city's abun-
dant population of schizophrenics, manic depressives, alcohoHcs, 
drug addicts and victims of innumerable other mental illnesses. It is 
a facility reminiscent of Dickens or Dreiser. On the days I visited, a 
steady procession of exhaust-belching trucks on North Frontage 
Road and the looming gray sky above seemed to complement per-
fectly the CMHC population, smoking cigarettes with downcast, ner-
vous eyes outside and waiting for the frazzled receptionist to call 
their names. 

On any given day, about a hundred patients walk in and out of 
CMHC's guarded doors, mainly to work in group sessions of 12 to 20 
people-but sometimes as large as 3o--on issues as varied as vio-
lence management, substance abuse and psychosocial issues. 
Currently, CMHC serves some 5,ooo patients in this capacity, and 
runs on an operating budget of some S30 million, with $22 million 
coming directly from the State of Connecticut. Of the 6oo employ-
ees who currently staff the CMHC, half are faculty and students from 
Yale, the other half state employees. Of the latter group, the major-
ity are social workers, nurses and various other mental health work-
ers. 

To obtain treatment at CMHC, a patient can either seek referral 
from a physician-if they have access to a physician, that is-or 
walk right into the facility. After giving their vital information to 
Admissions, a patient sits for an interview with a triage clinician. 
The clinician-a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist or social 
worker-is then free to foUow up the triage interview with one of 
three options: further assessment by a social worker to decide the 
need for and severity of treatment, admittance to the inpatient ward 
after consultation with a psychiatrist, or the least expensive and 
most-often used method of treatment, outpatient care. In fact, it is 
only on the fourth and fifth floors of the CMHC that patients can be 
admitted for one-on-one clinical and inpatient care. Of the 5,000 
patients CMHC has on its rolls, only 20 to 30 can be treated at a rime 
in the inpatient and "panial hospital" wards. The remaining 
patients must seek treatment in group counseling or in the various 
satellite facilities throughout the greater 
New Haven area. 

Tomas Reyes, associate administrator 
at CMHC, is a staunch advocate of the prac-
tice of outpatient care, calling it the best 
possible method of care with the resources 
currendy available to mental health profes-
sionals. Reyes-a New Haven Alderman 
and Vice-Chair of the Aldermanic Special 
Committee of the Homeless-has an office 
off a long hallway which can only be 
reached after walking through a metal 
detector and past the eyes of a tired-looking 
security guard. A sign, announcing 
"ABSOLUTBLY NO CAMERAS ALLOWED IN THE 
BUILDING," greets patients and visitors to 
CMHC. Cameras, the security guard 
explains to me, do not sit well with the 
patients at the facility, who often have a 
hard enough time dealing with the other 
patients in group therapy sessions and pri-
vate clinical meetings. 

Reyes arrives 25 minutes late to our 
appointment, sipping coffee from a styro-
foam cup and dressed in an expensive suit, 
offering his apologies. Reyes has served as 
the head of public and community rela-
tions at CMHC for several years, all while 
serving, in the words of the N~ Hawn 
Advocates Paul Bass as "the city's leading 
Latino politician." He is clearly a politi-
cian, and it shows. Next to his desk, on 
which sits a miniature model of a Porsche 
Carrera, is a tackboard with yellowed clip-
pings of pictures and articles about himself 
from the N~ Havm &gistn', alongside a 
letter from President Clinton. As we sit 
down to discuss the workings of the facili-
ty whose promotion is the letter and law of 
his job, he speaks grandly and gesticulates 
wildly, all the while towling his graying 
hair. 

"We have the best of both worlds," 
"g. Reyes announces proudly, "a state facility 
with a clear relationship and even a stand-
ing contract with Yale, and the New Haven 
community." Community is a favorite 
word of Reyes'; in our hour-long interview, 
he uses the word as both noun and adjec-
tive, peppering his statements with fre.. 
quent reference to his mission of making 
sure the community at large benefits from 
the goings-on at CMHC. The word figures 
prominendy in each of Reyes' descriptions 
of the initial three missions CMHC set out 
for itself at its founding: service to the 
client, education and, of course, research. It 
is not only the significant time and money 
spent on patients' treatment, Reyes stresses, 
that make the community and state fund-
ing for CMHC so valuable, but also the cen-
ter's role as a major research facility. 

"On any given Friday," Reyes contin-
ues, "you can find people from all over the 
New Haven community at our lectures and 
information sessions. Students from the 
School of Public Health, the School of 
Nursing, the Yale Medical School, Yale fac-
ulty, community members, everyone." 
Reyes casually mentions the fact that the 
third floor of the CMHC facility-the floor 
reserved for research-has room for 10 to 
12 patients at a time, sligbdy higher than 
the space made for inpatient care one floor 
above. 

But it is exacdy this habit of wing its 
patients for psychiatric research that has 
gotten the CMHC into trouble in recent 
years--a problem that NAMI discussed nine 
years ago in its 1990 report. Until the lead-
ership of former director Ezra Griffith, a 
Yale professor of psychiatry, critics in state 
government complained that patients were 
being wed as guinea pigs to further the 
research fevers of well-funded Yale depart-
ments. But as Reyes makes sure to note, it 
was during Griffith's tenure as director of 
CMHC that a fourth mission-"communi-
tas" -was added, specifically with the aim 
of wing research findings to further the 
role of community agencies in the larger 
indwtry effort. Still, many continue to 
worry that the best interests of patients 
may not always be on the agenda of either 
the administrators or physicians alike at 
CMHC. 

"There's no question that the empha-
sis, at least on the Yale side, is on research," 
says Beth, a patient-rights advocate at the 
CMHC who asked not to have her name 
wed in this article. "Everyone, especially 
the doaors at CMHC, pats [himself] on the 
back for the effectiveness of [his] treat-
ment, and no one cares to wonder 
about how the patients themselves are 
being treated." 

Beth tells a different story, one that is 
significandy free of the communitarian 
rhetoric Reyes is so fond of. The statistics, 
Beth says, do not lie; they merely mislead. 
"Of course Connecticut is one of the best 
states in the country for mental health care. 
And of course CMHc is about the best in 
Connecticut. That doesn't say much for the 
rest of the country, though," she says. "It's 
simply a disgrace." 

The problem, according to Beth, has 
to do with several factors: most important-
ly, a general public that knows nothing, 
and doesn't want to know-this problem is 
only made worse by the nearly complete 
absence of noted advocates in the mental 
health camp. "Everything looks good on 
paper, but the paper doesn't account for the 
fact that mental health patients, especially 
at CMHC, are treated as second-class citi-
zens." 

Most troubling, Beth says, is the 
national mental health situation. That only 
70,000 people can receive inpatient mental 
health care, she continues, is a simultane-
owly bewildering and infuriating reality. 
"You can't get in some facilities these days 
unless you break the law. We're turning our 
own people into criminals. To me, it's a 
wonder there aren't more Columbines." 

Being poor, and at the mercy of the 
scant services provided by Medicare and 
Medicaid, patients are only weful to facili-
ties like CMHC insofar as their treatments 
will yield significant research findings. 
"Giving your body to science," it seems,
