When Jedediah Purdy (LAW '01) was 
younger, his sister Hannah (ART '02.) could 
silence him by shouting their code word: 
"Club!" Jedediah's penchant for long, 
didactic orations led Hannah to seek some 
sort of recourse. If only the reading public 
of America were lucky enough to have the 
same agreement with Jedediah, it could be 
spared the flatness and sanctimony of For 
Common Things, his overextended rumina-
tion on "Irony, Trust, and Commitment in 
America Today." 


According to Purdy, his book is "the 
work of a love letter, a form that is litcle 
practiced today." And what is it that he 
loves? The things that we hold in common: 
the environment, politics and culture, 
which he thinks are easily divisible into 
three "systems of ecology": natural, moral 
and social. Purdy takes us on a rambling 
tour through these ecological systems. He 
drags us along with his friends Albert 
Camus, Czeslaw Milosz, Henry David 
Thoreau, Michel de Montaigne, Vaclav 
Havel and Bill Clinton, just to name a few 
of the figures he quotes, attacks, defends 
and nearly deifies. We also make stops in 
West Virginia (where he was born and 
raised by his hippie parents), the scrip-
mined towns of the Appalachians, and 
Washington, o.c. 


Certainly, Purdy has put his finger on 
a valid problem--contemporary America's 
apathy toward nature, morality and soci-
ety-and 
amassed a stag-
gering arsenal 
of knowledge. 
But to what /_/--~ 
end? 
Rather than 
yoking together these disparate 
minds into some sort of elegant conceit, 
Purdy offers their opinions and actions 
only as symptoms of and reactions to the 
grossest indecency humankind endures in 
its current state of turpitude: irony. Yes, it 
is irony, that rhetorical form which has last-
ed centuries and has provided the back-
bone of some of our greatest literature, that 
makes such villains as Jerry Seinfeld the 
emblems of our culture. Purdy, therefore, 
takes up the noble and ambitious task of 
"describing and diagnosing irony." Bur 
rather than confronting irony and trying to 
understand how and why it permeates our 
society, Purdy mounts his soapbox and 
StartS on a long, erring road to nothing in 
particular. 


What Purdy attacks as irony proves to 
be as amorphous and expansive as his book; 
for Purdy, irony includes cynkism, sar-
casm, politicians' rhetoric, and an inability 
to communicate emotions and thought. 
And that irony, Purdy would have us 
believe, has paralyzed us. It has engendered 
a fear that prevents us from taking any-
thing or anyone seriously: "It is a fear of 
betrayal, disappointment, and humiliation, 
and a suspicion that believing, hoping, or 
caring too much will open us 
to these. Irony is a way of 
refusing to rely on such 
treacherous things." Irony is 
both the cause and the effect of 
our unwillingness to pursue the 
"common things" Purdy advises 
us to embrace. 


Can irony be both cause and effect? 
Wouldn't it be ironic if it could? The 
biggest problem with Purdy's book is that 
irony-that specter of moral and social 
degradation that looms over the reader-is 
not clearly defined until page 203. And 
even then, Purdy provides an inelegant and 
defensive definition that undoes much of 
the previous 2.02 pages: "ln its textbook 
sense, irony refers to the presence in a state-
ment or experience of an unexpected 
meaning, a significance beyond and con-
trary to the obvious. Our contemporary 
irony shrugs off, doubts, and reassembles 
significance to drain words of evocation, 
beauty and moral weight. It discovers 
behind 
meaning 
the 
fact 
of its 
insignificance." 


But that is not the irony Purdy dis-
cusses and laments throughout the book. 
By the time he offers up this definition to 
his readers, he has so complicated the term 
"irony" that such a neat definition is not 
only impossible, but so reductionist that it 
renders his whole missio~ pointless. Take as 
an example his treatment of language and 
politics-a subject he should have left to
