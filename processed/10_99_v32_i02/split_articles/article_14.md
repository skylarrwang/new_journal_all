N OcroBER 5, I visited incumbent Mayor John DeStefano, 
Jr.'s headquarters in an office building at One Church 
Street. The lights in the sprawling room, which appeared 
to have once been a bank, were off. A lone elderly man was stuffing 
envelopes behind a counter. With the election less than a month 
away, I had expected more bustle. For a moment, I entertained the 
thought that I was not actually in the right place, that I had stum-
bled into a failed savings and loan that had decided to fill its bank-
rupt windows with "DeStefano for Mayor" signs. I asked the elder-
ly man if I was indeed at DeStefano headquarters. He directed my 
attention to an office I had overlooked when I walked in and the 
woman inside, saying, "she knows about those things." Apparently 
he did not. I approached the office and asked the more informed 
official if I could have some literature on the Mayor. "What I 
received were campaign materials that had been printed for the 
September 14 Democratic Primary. She assured me that new litera-
ture was on its way. As I left, I noticed that, interspersed with the 
red, white and blue, star-spangled DeStefano signs were smaller 
signs advertising in fluorescent writing that the space currently 
occupied by DeStefano's headquarters is "For Lease." 

DeStefano's operation is so ramshackle you would think he is 
running unopposed. But this is not the case. James Newton is an 
African American; he is 50 years old; he is a former Ward 5 alder-
man; he is former head of the New Haven Job Center; and he wants 
to be the next mayor of New Haven. On October 6, I walked into 
Newton's office at 365 "Whalley, an office you could fit into 
DeStefano Headquarters three times. A secretary busy at her desk 
20 
accompanied the only other person in the 
room: Jason Bartlett, Newton's campaign 
manager. Newton was attending a funeral 
down the street, and I waited in the office for 
about ten minutes for him to return. During 
those ten minutes, Bartlett fielded five phone 
calls. He ordered more campaign posters. He 
read into the phone an editorial written about 
the mayoral race in the New Havm Register 
and commented on it. He complained that the 
mayor's office had misquoted statistics about 
funding for city teachers in the editorial. 

On Bartlett's desk a mug holding pens 
had been taped over and "Jim for Mayor" writ-
ten on the rape. A steel rack by the desk 
overflowed with Newton's campaign materials. 
I picked one up. It read "Gana con jim [Win 
with Jim]," across the top, and on the bottom 
a label gave the date of the election, handwrit-
ten: "November 2, 1999." I pulled off the label to reveal the print-
ed words: "El 14 de Septiembre." On the wall behind Bartlett's desk 
hung one of a number of signs hand-written in black marker. One 
read: "October xst Day 32 What do you need to do? E-Day Nov. 
2nd." These small motivational signs were interspersed with 
Newton's campaign placards: "Jim Newton Mayor"-no graphics, 
no prepositions. 

In the September 14 Democratic mayoral primary, Mayor 
DeStefano defeated Jim Newton 6,182 to 3,776. Newton thus won 
nearly 40 percent of the vote, as well as Wards I and 2 (the wards 
with the highest percentage of Yale voters)--quite a feat for a can-
didate with almost no city-wide name recognition. When 
Republican Ann Piscattano challenged DeStefano in 1995 she could 
only rally 20 percent of New Haven's voters. The turnout for last 
month's primary was dismal: a scant 29 percent of the 34,500 eligi-
ble Democrats voted. Perhaps New Haven Democrats are apathet-
ic. Or perhaps they had forgotten that there are primaries in New 
Haven-Newton was the first Democrat to challenge DeStefano 
since the Mayor took office six years ago. Unfazed by the loss, 
Newton renounced his affiliation with the Democratic Party soon 
after the primary and vowed to run against DeStefano as an 
Independent.

Newton's success was probably due less to his own platform 
and more to his dismantling of DeStefano's. In the months leading 
up to the primary, Newton gained public approval through his fer-
vent attacks on the Long Wharf Mall proposal, which was ulti-
,

mately approved by the Board of Aldermen in early August. In 
June, Newton called for a referendlim that would allow New Haven 
residents to vote on the mall. In a series of press conferences in July, 
Newton brought public attention to the issue of the mall, a project 
he would have killed. In particular, Newton has attacked the mall's 
co-developer: the Fusco Corporation. 

And with good reason. As Katherine Hawkins reported in a 
July 29 article in the N~ Havm Aavocate, Fusco's corporate histo-
ty is suspect at best. Fusco has never built a full-sized malL The cor-
poration has managed a mall of this size, purchasing the lease to 
Sunshine Mall in Clearwater, Florida, in 1972. Was the corporation 
When Newton returned to the office, we decided to have a 
working lunch and walked to a nearby diner. Newton greeted the 
people eating lunch as we made our way to a booth in the back-
he is an upstart, but he is nonetheless a politician. After he ordered 
a sandwich, we began our talk in earnest. DeStefano has dismissed 
Newton as a mudslinger. I wanted to know what Jim Newton's plat-
form looks like. 

Newton began by defending his vehement attacks on the 
Mayor: "I would be irresponsible if I did not bring these issues to 
the forefront," he said. He started talking about "corruption" and 
"fraud" at City Hall, but by the time the 
successful at mall management? That 
depends on who you ask. When the 
Sunshine Mall hit rocky financial times in 
1995, Fusco simply stopped paying its 
property taxes, rent and mortgage. The 
Fusco Corporation ultimately paid off 
only a fraction of the debt they incurred

waitress delivered his sandwich he had 
thought better of it. He quickly turned 
to what he calls "the positive." He ran 
down a list of the proposals he has 
made: about education, about econom-
ics, about the need for a permanent 
Inspector General-putting a comma 
between each idea with a rap of his hand 
on the formica table. 

That victory, I believe, is 
running the Sunshine Mall. 

Not only has Fusco mismanaged a 
very ~nuch vvithin his gras p . 
mall but they also have misappropriated 
state dollars, as a Newton press conference 
brought to light. Goodwin Square Ltd., a 
partnership controlled by a Fusco subsidiary, was given $94 million 
from a Connecticut workers' pension fund by the state treasurer's 
office in 1987. The money was given to Goodwin Square to reno-
vate a hotel and office building in the state capitol. In the June 20 
press conference, Newton told the public what Catherine Lamarr, 
general counsel for the treasurer's office, had told his campaign: 
Goodwin Square is in default for the entire debt (and thus owes the 
state over $100 million dollars) and the treasurer's office is ready to 
foreclose. The Fusco Corporation, Newton argued, has shown itSelf 
to be completely irresponsible. They are also, Newton reminded, 
major contributors to Mayor DeStefano's campaign. 

In addition to these legitimate salvos, Newton makes some 
more brazen claims about New Haven's political machine. An 
excerpt from Newton's campaign literature reads:

Newton especially stressed educa-
tion. He talked about the sad irony that 
New Haven has one of the greatest universities in the world and 
some of the worst public schools in the state. He talked about cre-
ating a bridge between Yale and New Haven's public schools. He 
talked about using Yale's experts to improve public school curricu-
la, especially in grades one through three. Newton is an increasing-
ly savvy politician. Throughout our talk he stressed his appreciation 
ofYale, both as an institution and as a constituency. 

A half-hour had passed and Newton, so excited to talk about 
his campaign, hadn't even touched his sandwich. 

Newton is not just an opponent; he is a champion of opposi-
tion. Newton put together an opposition ticket for the September 
primary. Included on that ticket was aldermanic candidate Edward 
Negroni. Until the week following his loss in the primary, Negroni 
distributed food provided by the Connecticut Food Bank to neigh-
bors. According to Negroni, he distributed food to approximately 
1,000 families each month from his backyard. Days after the pri-
mary, the city stopped Negroni's food distribution, citing health 
concerns. The timing was a bit suspect: the city had allowed 
Negroni to distribute food for months. The city never harassed 
Negroni before he challenged an incumbent Democrat. 

In another incident in the weeks since the primary, Newton 
was asked to leave Bowen Field by Charisse Townsend, who was
