A cold wind blew down Orange Street on the morning of September 14, 1999. Despite the weather, both candidates for the Democratic primary of the Ward 7 Aldermanic election had arrived before 8 AM to set up camp and greet voters. Esther Armmand, the four-term incumbent, stood on the sidewalk in a bright red suit and full makeup, smiling, shaking hands and handing out fliers. Half a block away stood Asit Gosar (PC 'oo), her 21-year-old challenger, wearing a gray fleece over a black "Go for Gosar" shirt. Dark circles under his eyes attested to the last-minute campaign preparations that had kept his camp up until 3 AM. Gosar greeted each vanload of voters with handshakes and hugs. In his hand he held a printout of his database and was checking them off as they arrived, with a meticulousness typical of his eight-month campaign. By the end of the day, that list was going to get him into a lot of trouble. 

When the polls closed at 8 PM, Gosar, Armmand and their respective supporters filed into a room in the basement of the New Haven Hall of Records, where they waited, alongside members of the Yak Daily News (YDN) and the New Havm Register, for officials to count the ballots. The anxious candidates would have to wait over two hours before finding out that Gosar had squeaked out a 2.98-2.69 victory. Meanwhile the press had begun to stir.  "Ned Ji, [YDN reporter] comes up to me at the conclusion of the election and says, 'Can I have your list of voters?' Gosar said. "I had [the list] in my hand. I wasn't hiding them off; I just gave it to him. I guess that was my big mistake. It had everything--colleges, room numbers. I guess that's what they used." 

Sometime during Election Day, reporters for the YDN had noticed freshmen at the Ward 7 voting center. Suspecting an irregularity--freshmen typically live on Old Campus, which is located in Ward x--the reporters checked Gosar's records and voter registration cards supplied by Robert Smuts (SM 'ox), the registrar of voters for the Yale College Democrats. They found "at least 20" Yale students whose right to vote in Ward 7 could be questioned: Davenport and Pierson students whose beds were not located in the ward in which they voted. 

Excitement ran high at the YDN office, just five blocks away, as reporters rushed around, trying to verify the election statutes and getting reactions from freshmen registered to vote. Six YDN reporters contributed to the front-page story on September 15, which was picked up by the New Havm Register and then by The New York Times. Within a week, investigations had uncovered 34 questionable votes, more than Gosar's margin of victory. Amid a storm of controversy and facing a lawsuit funded by Armmand's supporters, Gosar withdrew from the race. 

On the surface, the YDN's work was exemplary student reporting. But a passage in that first article suggested a story behind the story. 

Sara Kang '03, a member of Pierson College, said Isaiah Wilner (PC) 'oo, a member of Gosar's staff, instructed her to erase "Lanman-Wright" and put "Yale-Pierson College" in its place. 
"He took me through it all," Kang said. 
Wilner said he registered Pierson students, and some were freshmen. He also said he registered all these students as Pierson residents. 
Wilner is the Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Daily News. 

This was the first time the YDN had mentioned the names Isaiah Wilner and Asit Gosar in the same article. The two had been roommates and close friends, however, since junior year. In the days before the election, the YDN printed seven front-page articles about Gosar without hinting at this potential conflict of interest. 

"What we both thought at the time [in January] was there is at least a perceived conflict of interest and at many times the perception is as important as the reality," Wilner explained. "So we set up a firewall. I wouldn't work for Asit. That meant he wouldn't give me any information and I wouldn't give any to him. We were roommates, that's it. We're still roommates." 

"Isaiah and I were not allowed to speak about it," Gosar said. "We set up that wall early on. The irony was, we were nailed for a perceived conflict of interest, not an actual conflict of interest ... we didn't quite understand the power of that perception--especially of us as power-seekers and power-holders--people love to distrust that." 

OCTOBER 15, 1999

Gosar went on, "We decided that we shouldn't allow bullshit politics to affect our personal lives. Why shouldn't we room together just because we both do stuff? He's one of my closest friends." 

Both residents of Pierson 1492 had confidence in their ability to separate work and personal lives. They tried to deal with a problem of public perception by making a private decision not to share information or help each other. Each sat at his desk in their small common room, working for their respective organizations, by their avowals never discussing how things were going. 

How well did the "firewall" hold up? 
Not too well, it seems. Although not an official member of the staff, Wilner assisted the Go For Gosar campaign by registering freshmen to vote in Ward 7. At the very least, he gave these voters the impression he was a member of Gosar's staff, as Sara Kang believed and erroneously told the YDN. 

Even if the roommates never shared information, maybe this rule was not enough to protect the YDN's objectivity. 
"Isaiah didn't go out of his way to make his efforts clear," said a board member, referring to the firewall. "He should have called a board meeting and explained things from start to finish." Instead, his relationship to Gosar correlated quite well with the YDN's handling of the campaign. "I definitely thought the coverage was too much slanted in favor of Asit as the young, enthusiastic Yale student 'listening to other students' concerns'," said Rorie Tobin (BR 'ox), an Armmand supporter. "If anything, I think it was sort of stupid on the part of the YDN to not look out for that." YDN board members and reporters alike echoed these concerns. 

From the time of Gosar's announcement of candidacy in January until the election, the YDN quoted him 20 times, more than any other candidate. Most stories focused on his "grass-roots campaign," talking about his door-to-door canvassing and study breaks. On September 9, referring to Gosar's "aggressive get-out-the-vote campaign," Charles Forelle (PC '02) wrote, "Esther Armmand's got a problem in Pierson." 

In an attempt to balance the coverage, a profile of Armmand ran on the front page on September 10. It was placed, however, alongside a story about a landlord attempting to revive a lawsuit against her for back rent. Both stories ran under the headline "Faced With Lawsuit, Armmand Points to Record," creating the impression of a politician on the defensive from a serious attack on her ethics. 

Did Wilner cross the firewall in order to tip the stories in favor of Gosar? He maintains he gave City Editor Henry Whitaker (OC 'oo) full editorial control over all Gosar stories. (Whitaker repeatedly declined to comment.) But on September 17, the New Havm Register reported, "Some staffers are upset Wilner earlier edited stories about the election and did not divulge to readers his close relationship with Gosar." Several sources on the YDN staff told The New Journal that Wilner called the Armmand profile too positive before it ran. 

By Wilner's own admission, "A senior editor has a huge impact on the atmosphere of the Newsroom." Wilner said he removed himself from the paper after the election because "I didn't want to cause a chilling effect." But could his presence before the election have had that same effect? By simply wearing his Go For Gosar T-shirt around the YDN office, as he often did, Wilner may have swayed the coverage. 

The staff of the YDN commonly explained the attitude of the coverage before the primary as the "hometown favorite" effect. Stories focused on Gosar because he was a Yalie, quoting him more often than Armmand or others because he was more readily available for comment. But many staff members said not enough was done to correct the appearance of bias. 

"We screwed up," one staff member said. "The conflict of interest was not apparent." 

Whether the pre-election coverage reflected the normal bias of slipshod student reporting under the rush of daily deadlines, or something more sinister, Gosar basked in the YDN's favor. 

When the pendulum swung the other way, though, it hit Gosar hard. The new tone was set by the headline which appeared the morning after the election: "At Least 20 Students Vote Illegally in Ward 7." "Libel," Gosar called it. To justify the use of the term "illegal," the YDN relied not on the voter registration statutes, but on one quotation from Thomas Ferguson, the director of elections for the Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State: "Residence is determined by where you lay your head at night." 

In doing so, the initial story and the
