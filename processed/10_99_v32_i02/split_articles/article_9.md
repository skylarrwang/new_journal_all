whose statement lent credibility to Ruiz.'s 
account also says Raucci coerced her. In 
her statement this woman claimed to have 
spoken to Ruiz while. Lewis and Morant 
were in Turner's house. 
But, she now 
maintains, she did not see Ruiz that night. 
She never would have walked 
Howard Avenue at 4 AM. A teenager at , 
time, the young woman signed the false 
statement because Raucci intimidated her. 
The FBI report teems with other infor-
mation casting doubt on Lewis' guilt. 
Friends ofTurner say Lewis and Turner did 
not know each other, and five witnesses 
vouch for Lewis' alibi. These employees of 
Minuteman Press confirm that Lewis was 
with them on October n for the phone 
company's rush job and voice their surprise 
that police never officially interviewed 
them. They do, however, recall that Raucci 
unofficially interviewed Rochler. 
One 
employee recalls Raucci ceiling Rochler 
that he would keep the visit a secret "if he 
knew what was good for him." 


A motive for the framing emerges 
from other interviews. Parise, now serving 
a zo-year sentence for dealing cocaine, 
states that Lewis owed him $18,ooo in drug 
debts, and Lewis says that in January 1991 
Parise told him, "Vinny wants his money." 
Lewis had heard that Raucci was a "dirty" 
cop, but he didn't know Raucci's first name 
and thus did not equate Raucci with 
"Vinny." At his arrest in April 1991, Lewis 
says Raucci taunted, "You should have 
never stopped selling drugs in Fair Haven." 


The most compelling statement, how-
ever, is that of the state's star witness, Ovil 
Ruiz. When FBI agents interviewed Ruiz in 
February 1996, he initially repeated the 
story he had told at Lewis and Morant's 
trial. However, after some prodding, Ruiz 
admitted that he "had not been completely 
truthful in his testimony." He tearfully dis-
closed a great fear of Parise, and an even 
greater fear of Raucci. When FBI agents 
said they weren't aftaid of Raucci, "Ruiz 
began crying more forcefully then, losing 
his composure." Finally, Ruiz. said he had 
been "living for five years with a terrible 
secret which he could no longer contain:" 
Lewis and Morant were innocent. 


Ruiz maintained that the details of his 
testimony were crue, save for one key sub-
stitution-he had changed the names of 
the murderers. Frank Parise had set up the 
double murder. Lewis and Morant had 
nothing to do with it. 

According to Ruiz, Parise and his drug 
circle punished debtors differendy from 
other drug lords. Rather than killing these 
street dealers, they had them set up and 
sent to jail. But Parise needed a cop to 
facilitate the setups. Raucci fit the role per-
fectly. 


When pressured to make a false 
statement, Ruiz remembered all too well 
Raucci's pointing a gun at him ax'td saying. 
"I can kill you and get away with it." 


Local authorities disagreed. Following 
a brief interview with Raucci, Police Chief 
Mel Wearing denounced the FBI's investi-
" ~cion and stated his confidence in Raucci's 
.; "" innocence. The U.S. Attorney's office in 
Connecticut argued that the new evidence 
wasn't strong enough to implicate Raucci. 
yJ Ruiz lied once, they asked, why should 
his recantation be trusted? 
Indeed, this 
question seems justified by the final page of 
the FBI report, which contains an interview 
with Ruiz a year later, in February 1997· In 
this statement Ruiz recants yet again. He 
declares that Lewis pressured him to lie to 
the FBI, and he did so out of fear. Ruiz 
maintains that his initial testimony-that 
which he gave at the trial of Lewis and 
Morant-was the cruth. 


Raucci relied not only on intimidation 
but also on his self-proclaimed instinct and 
wiles to plot the setup, says Ruiz. Worried 
about Ruiis credibility, Raucci ordered 
him to shoot a competing drug dealer. 
Raucci would then arrest him, and Ruiz 
would cut a deal with police-to reduce his 
own sentence, Ruiz would provide infor-
mation implicating Lewis and Morant in 
the double murder. 


Ruiz's recanting of his entire testimony 
forces reconsideration of Lewis' and 
Morant's convictions. With the prosecu-
tion's only real witness declaring his 
account false, the defense has a clear case 
for a new trial. This, at least, is what fed-
eral agents concluded this past summer 
when they and local authorities sifted 
through the tangle of interviews attempt-
ing to reach conclusions. Federal agents 
requested that a grand jury reconsider the 
case, claiming that there was enough evi-
dence to implicate Raucci and set Lewis 
and Morant free.

Local authorities conceded that Ruiz.'s 
fmal, and also first, testimony might not be 
completely true, but they maintained that 
its essence was trustworthy, and they voiced 
· support for Raucci. Local authorities were 
also no doubt influential in allowing 
Raucci's return to New Mexico. His bond 
was lowered from $450,000 to $5o,ooo, 
and outstanding criminal charges were dis-
posed. Raucci flew back to New Mexico a 
free man. 


But while Raucci may be safely out of 
state, his name is going to be tossed aro\lnd 
in Connecticut courts a lot this year. The 
double murder is not the only case that 
involves Raucci as a major player or that 
casts doubt on Raucci's character already 
tainted by a criminal record of larceny and 
domestic abuse. 


Just last month, for example, Raucci 
was mention ed in an oral argument per-
taining to a 1997 rape case. 
It appears 
Raucci, the lead detective on the case, slept 
with the alleged victim. In fact, both the 
prosecution and defense agree that he did. 
The only question is when. 


The state claims that the sex occurred 
two weeks after the rape and therefore is 
irrelevant to the case. 
The woman's 
upstairs neighbor, however, maintains that 
Raucci stayed with the woman the night of 
the rape. 
This neighbor says she saw 
Raucci's car parked outside the house all 
night, and in the morning the alleged rape 
victim apologized to her for any "noise she 
may have made while she had engaged in 
'wild sex' with Det. Vinny Raucci." 


It is highly unlikely that a rape victim 
would have "wild sex" the night she was 
raped, says Public Defender Lauren 
Weisfeld, who argues that her client was 
wrongly convicted of rape and deserves a 
new trial. The woman's sex with Raucci 
had not been admitted as evid~ce at the 
trial; federal law prohibits a w~man's sex 
life being discussed in a rape trial for fear 
that she will be branded promiscuous and a 
jury will be prejudiced against her. 


Weisfeld, however, argued that the 
woman's sex with Raucci has direct bearing 
on the case and should be admissible. If 
nothing else, Raucci's relationship with the 
woman biased his investigation, and possi-
bly led to the wrongful conviction of 
Weisfeld's client. 


This brings the tally of men who 
attribute their convictions to Raucci's ques-
tionable actions to three, all of whom are 
currently motioning for new trials. As a 
state appellate panel considers Weisfeld's 
request for a new trial, attorney Michael 
Jefferson is petitioning for a new trial for 
Lewis, and Fitzpatrick is doing the same for 
Morant. 


All three attorneys and their 
clients will have to wait months for court 
verdicts, which will determine only 
whether new trials are granted, not the 
guilt and innocence of participants. Says 
Fitzpatrick, "I'm on the edge ot my seat, 
and I'm in the middle of all this. You'd 
need a crystal ball to see how this will turn 
out." 


Lewis' and Morant's motions for new 
trials are cettain to involve much court-
room drama. State forces will pit them-
selves against federal documents, as author-
ities with a vested interest in maintaining 
Raucci's credibility challenge the FBI 
report. The state has good reason to shield 
Raucci, who closed many cases as a detec-
tive. There are many people sitting behind 
bars due to his testimony. If Raucci is offi-
cially pronounced a parmer in a drug sydi-
cate, the state will look bad, and the police 
department will lose respect and trust. 


There may be other Lewises and Morants 
who will push for new trials. Who knows 
how many people Raucci may have framed, 
how many people are serving time for 
Wrongful convictions.
