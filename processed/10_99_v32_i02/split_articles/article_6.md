Dances with Indians 
On September 14 at the Shubert Theater, 
Peter Buffet debuted Spirit, his ambitious 
musical that attempts to blend many types 
of Native American powwow dancing with 
contemporary Western dance, music, and 
themes. Spirit follows one man as his alien-
ation from an impersonal modern society 
compels him to take a journey into the 
spiritual world of Native Americans. The 
show spans from precolonial North 
America to the arrival of Christian mis-
sionaries, and culminates in the main char-
acter's understanding and reclaiming of his 
Indian heritage. 

Chief Hawk Pope and four Native 
singers complement the journey with the 
pounding drums and songs of powwow 
music. Each dance in the musical symbol-
izes key historical developments; the choir 
that accompanies one of the dances sym-
bolizes the influence of Christianity, while 
the sudden mixing of dancers or change of 
musical styles represents cultural blending 
and assimilation. As this man becomes 
more involved in the dances and finally 
accepts 
the invitation to JOln 
omnipresent drum, the musical score 
blends modern bongos and percussions, 
electric and bass guitars and electronic key-
boards. 

While Spirit emphasizes a journey to 
rediscover the Native American experience, 
the show uses both Indian and European 
dance and music. This blending provoked 
interest from several Native American stu-
dents at Yale. Sophomore Nelva Cervantes 
and I, both Native Americans, attended 
Spirit to see how well it captured the Native 
American experience. 

Cervantes, a Mescalero Apache, said, 
"I think it was billed as being tr-aditional 
Native dance and music and it was repre-
sented as that. But they made these over-
whelming generalizations encompassing all 
Native peoples, and it was silly. I hope peo-
ple don't think of Native American culture 
as being one thing, as something that's sta-
tic and stuck in the past." 

· Cervantes asks why this nineteenth 
century image of the stoic Native is not 
updated. She wonders why natives need to 
be transported into the past in order to be 
better understood in the present. "[The 
show] uses powwow dancing, which is con-
temporary," said Cervantes, "but Spirit 
portrays an Indian identity in this Plains 
Indian stereotype ·that all Indians rode 
horses and lived in teepees. Spirit has a lack 
of understanding of the diversity of tradi-
tional Native cultural beliefs." 

Ironically, Spirit opened at the Shubert 
only two days before Schemitzun, the East 
Coast's largest annual powwow and gather-
ing of diverse Native communities from 
Indian nations across America, Mexico and 
Canada. This event, located at the 
Mashantucket Pequot Reservation near 
Ledyard, Conn., attracted drummers, 
singers, dancers, artists and rodeo cowboys, 
as well as Native and non-Native Yale stu-
dents. 

For two long days of competition, 
hundreds of the world's best powwow 
dancers competed in categories for each 
style, age group and dance type. Nearly 
fifty drum groups representing their 
nations surrounded the grass dance arena 
and provided rhythm and song for the dif-
ferent dances. Each day's grand entry, 
which customarily acknowledges the tribes 
represented, featured several hundred 
dancers entering the arena to the beat of 
resonating drums. 

The image of Apache dancers captivat-
ing a crowd with their talent and fluidity 
stood in stark contrast to Spirit's flashing 
spodights, loud electric guitars and over-
simplified narration which condensed 
Native American philosophy into simplis-
tic sentences. The crowd at Schemitzun of 
several thousand during the two days 
ranged widely in age and ethnicity, but 
shared an outward appreciation for Native 
culture by respectfully acknowledging 
moments of prayer and traditions. 

Last April, Yale hosted its own authen-
tic celebration of Native American culture, 
a po~ow, organized by the Association of 
Native Americans at Yale (ANAAY). There 
are approximately 30 Native American stu-
dents involved in ANAAY. Corning from 
upbringings ranging from reservations to 
urban environments, these students have 
histories and personalities that are as 
diverse as those of students in any other 
ethnic organization on campus. 

powwow, 
which 
attracted 
dancers, singers and vendors from the 
entire Northeast, accomplished one of the 
current goals of the Association-reflecting 
the diversity and complexity of today's 
Native American culture. The powwow 
made students and community members 
aware of authentic Native culture and, of 
ANAAYS growing presence on campus. 

The Yale powwow and Schemitzun 
both recognized that the Native American 
experience cannot be condensed into a 
musical narrative of history. The Yale pow-
wow brought authentic songs and dance 
competition to the school community and 
Schernitzun represented scores of nations 
as unique groups and cultures in their own 
right. On the other hand, it lacked an in-
depth perspective by broadly sampling 
Native elements of dance and music. These 
two authentic powwows show how the 
Native American experience is more com-
plicated than its representation in Spirit. 
Perhaps 
Spirit 
misrepresents 
Native 
Americans because it assumes that there is 
only 
one 
true 
sputt.
