**Title: George W. Bush at Yale: Intellectual Snobbery?**
**Author:  Not specified**
**Page number(s): 12**

George W. Bush was expected to go to Yale, but did it live up to his expectations? 

D 
uring an interview this summer in Austin, Texas, the 
Washington Post dropped an open-ended statement in the 
lap of George W. Bush (oc '68). "It's been expressed by 
others," said the reporter, "that you were turned off by the intellec-
tual snobbery at Yale." 


This topic is eagerly discussed by the current Governor of 
Texas, who never misses a chance to point out that he is not-and 
never has been-an intellectual snob. Or an intellectual, for that 
matter. "I've been turned off by intellectual snobbery most of my 
life," said Bush. "Because once you go to those schools and can 
compete academically, you realize that these people who think just 
because they went to one of those schools and can lord their intel-
ligence over others, really are quite shallow." 


When asked if he would call himself an intellectual, the 53-
year-old former oil industry executive and part owner of the Texas 
Rangers offers this response: "If I did, everybody who knows me 
would roar with laughter. I think you know I've been around intel-
lectuals before." 


Bush does not want to be branded an East Coast, Ivy League-
educated elitist intellectual. And in fact, he is not an intellectual-
at least with all the baggage that term 
implies. Bush's mediocre grades and 
lack of academic focus at Yale hint at 
an absence of interest in the world of 
ideas, and the Governor's recent 
statements have shown this to be 
true. The September issue of Talk 
magazine included an interview with 
Bush in which a reporter asked him 
if he could name something that he 
is not good at. Without hesitating, 
Bush replied, "Sitting down and 
reading a soo-page book on public 
policy or philosophy or something." 


A copy of Bush's transcript 
(with grades blotted out) that was 
obtained by the Washington Post 
from the Texas Air National Guard 
contains a list of his classes, which 
are unremarkable by any measure. As 
a history major, he took a wide range 
of history classes, but other than a 
few brief forays into anthropology, philosophy and Japanese (a 
course of literature in translation), his transcript demands no par-
ticular attention. Although Bush has asked Yale not to release his 
grades, we can surmise that they were weak. Maureen Dowd, a 
columnist for Th~ N~ York Tim~s. recently noted that while visit-
ing an elementary school in Bedford, New Hampshire, Bush told a 
group of students, "Some people say that I proved that if you get a 
C average, you can end up being successful in life." 


It is abundantly dear that Bush was not, is not, and will never 
be considered an intellectual. 


But the charge of elitism--especially social elitism-is nearly 
impossible for Bush to kill off. Regardless of what Bush says, his 
money, his elite education, and his family and political connections 
have greatly defined his life. In reading George W. Bush's story, you 
realize that influence and connections were frequently employed on 
Bush's behalf. The Bush name itself-and lircle else--eventually 
allowed him to become a moderate success in the oil business. To a 
lesser degree, a similar story can be told about Harvard alum Al 
Gore. Even small town-born Bill Bradley-who graduated from 
Princeton-was the local banker's son. In a year when the three 
main contenders for the presidency are 
Ivy League graduates who were born 
with silver spoons of varying sizes in 
their mouths, it makes sense for Bush to 
pull a Bill Clinton and play, as much as 
possible, the average, hometown Joe. 


And calling Yale a tower of snobbery is a 
good first step in that direction. The 
only problem for Bush is that the Yale of 
1968 was not a paragon of elitism or a 
bastion of intellectual snobbery. In fact, 
snobbery of any type-intellectual or 
social-was noticeably absent within the 
college. 


Steven Bourke (oc '68), who lived 
near Bush in Davenpon for two years, 
remarks that, "I didn't meet an intellec-
tual snob during the entire time I was at 
Yale. I came across m~y types of peo-
ple, but I never met anyone like that." 


After a shon pause, he continues, "In 
fact, snobbery--<>f any kind-was not 
.... George W. Bush on his father's shoulders.
