George W. Bush entered Yale in the fall of 1964, at a time when American involvement in Vietnam was limited, the drug revolution had not yet begun and life--for upper-class white families, that is-was still stable and relatively simple. Terry Johnson (oc '68), a roommate and close friend of Bush's from Yale, volunteers that Robert Dieter, another of Bush's roommates, calls that period the "happy days ... You know, like the TV show. Everything was simple then, before the whole situation broke apart."


Although Yale was relatively untouched by the changes that were beginning to ripple across the country when Bush arrived in New Haven during the fall of 1964, the college and the country itself were soon engulfed by the political tumult of the 196os. Jim Sleeper discussed the period in a phone interview, pointing out that "although the freshmen were dominated by the preppy ethos, the very ground was shifting under our feet. The whole culture of Yale and the country was changing."


The rapidly escalating war in Vietnam played a major role in this change. But although major anti-war protests had begun to take place across the country by 1967, and William Sloane Coffin-Yale's chaplain and a leader of the national anti-war movement-was arrested for aiding draft resisters during 1968, Bush has stated that "I just don't remember much protest ... But maybe I just missed it. I wasn't looking for it." For whatever reason, Bush did not focus on the issues of the day. He remained part of the Yale he entered-the Yale of 1964-and was little influenced by the transformative medium that Yale quickly became.


It was through his social life that this scion of the wealthy, influential and politically-connected Bush family truly excelled at Yale. Many recall that Bush was affable and gregarious, able to move easily between and within varied social groups, and excellent at connecting with people on a one-to-one basis. By the time he arrived in New Haven, Bush already possessed the kind of people skills needed to succeed in politics. As Johnson explains, "George cut across a whole bunch of dividing lines-between jocks, and folks who were artistic. He moved among different groups in a way not many did. In a class of 1,000, an average person might know 200 people, and 20 well. George doubled that." Bush's friend Frederick Livingston agrees, explaining that, "George was definitely one of the 20 or 25 best known leadership-type people in our class." He continues, pointing out that Bush was "exceptionally good on a one-to-one basis with people. The extent to which he was a leader was because of his personality, his ability to make others feel comfortable."


George W Bush has retained most of the friends he made at Yale. And he made a lot. Nearly everyone who knew Bush at Yale-even those who knew him in the most tenuous way-has something good to say about him. John Duff and John H. Hill, for example, the two freshmen counselors who lived in Lawrance Hall with Bush, were eager to expound upon Bush's social graces and personal charisma, even though neither has had much contact with him since leaving Yale 35 years ago. Both, however, had very recently become reacquainted with the Governor. Last month, Hill bumped into Bush while stepping out of a bathroom at a Pittsburgh GOP fundraising luncheon. "Bush remembered me immediately. It was really amazing," he said. Bush's freshmen counselors must regard the Governor highly, because they both supported his campaign. According to the fundraising records that Bush has posted on his web site, Hill gave $900 to the Bush campaign, and Duff contributed $1000, the legal limit for an individual.


Although Bush has distanced himself from the University, never attending a class reunion and refusing to update the class history, he has nevertheless remained close to the friends he made at Yale. Terry Johnson said that Bush "has been greatly involved with his friends, and tremendously loyal to his friends. That is very important to George." It is surprising that a man who made so many close friends in New Haven now stands apart from the University. When asked about his relationship with Yale by the Washington Post, Bush responded that "I love my friends at Yale. But I was irritated at Yale because it took an act of Congress literally to get them to give my Dad an honorary degree. You bet. I just can't believe the university would not be bending over backwards to ... give this man an honor and treat him with the utmost respect." Though Bush may have been frustrated with Yale's treatment of his father, his distancing act began more than a decade earlier, after he lost his first Congressional race-in a rural district in West Texas--after being branded an over-educated "liberal northeast Republican" by his GOP opponent.


George W. Bush's list of activities at Yale reads blandly, and, characteristically, does not include anything the young Bush would have described as "intellectual." His record includes no writing or debating. All of his extracurricular activities can be grouped into two categories: athletics and exclusive social clubs. He rushed Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) sophomore year and during his junior year was selected as its president.


DKE, for a number of reasons, merits special attention. Greek life on campus had been declining since before Bush arrived in 1964. As the percentage of public school students at Yale College edged above 50 percent, the number of students who could afford the $160 annual fees for fraternity membership began a steep decline. At the same time, the ongoing transformation of the social fabric of the country, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War drew increasing numbers of students away from the isolated world of the fraternities and into politics, debate and writing. As Steven Bourke explained, "the fraternities' influence on campus began to decline very early. The actual number of frats did decline, but more important was the fact that from 1961 to 1969, the frats just kind of deflated."


During Bush's senior year, the fraternity rush season at Yale hit the pages of The New York Times twice. In October, the Times reported that Phi Gamma Alpha, one of Yale's six fraternities, would close because of debt and an inability to draw enough new members. Another fraternity president was quoted as stating that Phi Gamma Alpha suffered from "an exaggerated problem which plagues all fraternities here." He explained, "Fewer people than ever before can afford them, and fewer people want what they have to offer-which is perhaps frivolous diversion for bits of entertainment no longer very much in demand on the campus."


In late October 1967, the Yale Daily News published an article charging DKE and one other fraternity with employing "sadistic and obscene" initiation rituals. Apparently, DKE had applied a hot branding iron to the small of the back of its 40 new members that fall, leaving a scab in the shape of the Greek letter Delta. By then a former president of the organization, Bush defended DKE's actions in the pages of The New York Times, explaining that the wound was "only [like] a cigarette burn." In the end, the Yale Interfraternity Council fined DKE for its participation in initiation rituals that "violated the spirit of fraternity restrictions." The fact that Bush was willing to take a stand about fraternity branding rituals at a time when many of his classmates were beginning to address more vital issues such as the Vietnam War and draft resistance is telling about Bush's priorities at the time.


In Skull & Bones, Bush found a safe haven for his senior year. The vow of secrecy the members of the secret society took allowed Bush to speak freely about his conservative views at a time when the campus was becoming increasingly liberal. While his fellow Bonesmen included a student from Jamaica, an Orthodox Jew and a Jordanian, Bush was, by many accounts, a recipient of a legacy slot. Bush's father, George H. W Bush, and his grandfather, Prescott S. Bush-a Connecticut senator-both were members of Skull & Bones.


Along with his father and grandfather, George W Bush also had four uncles who attended Yale.


A picture begins to emerge. A third-generation Bonesman with a multitude of relatives who attended Yale, Bush was as much a part of the Old Yale social elite as one could be. His status as a social monarch and president of DKE can only add to this image. And yet, even though it is clear that Bush comes from this enormously privileged background, his public statements about Yale can only be seen as attempts to dissemble and disassociate himself from an intellectual elitism that Yale did not harbor. Perhaps Bush recognizes that Americans are often more comfortable accepting social and class-based privilege than even a hint of intellectual elitism. Ironically, the school from which he now distances himself was more a bastion of privilege than of the intellect.
