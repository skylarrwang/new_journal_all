Expert advice is still necessary, of 
course. "Essential oils are highly concen-
trated and should be used with respect and 
extreme care. Never take essential oils inter-
nally without the guidance of a profession-
al Aromatherapist," Bretter writes in a Bier. 
He knows all the properties of the oils and 
will help me avoid using ones that might 
have harmful effects. H e "assume[s] no 
responsibility if [I] choose to prescribe for 
[myself] without the approval of a licensed 
medical doctor." 

Finally, I come back around to the 
man at the central table, the psychics' 
receptionist, 
their 
boolcing 
agent. 
Immediately he asks me, "Are you ready to 
make an appointment with one of the psy-
chics?" I ask him who the psychics are, and 
as he rattles off their names and specialties, 
I match his face to the picture on the 
brochure. He is the Reverend Robert 
Stempson, fair organizer, and director of a 
higher learning center-"PHD I A Center 
of Conscious Living." 

He tells me my choices for psychics: 
James, who does intuitive readings and 
past-life regressions, a specialist in helping 
people connect with spirit guides; Thea 
who does tarot; as does Donna, who also 
uses a crystal ball. How will I ever pick the 
right psychic? As I come to understand, the 
tarot deck and crystal ball are only tools. 
What is important is that the psychic gets 
in touch with my subconscious and pick 
up on my spiritual energy. I decide to go 
with my feelings and speak with Thea. 

Thea lays the tarot cards on the table 
and instructs me to shuffle them while con-
centrating on the questions I want her to 
answer. She clarifies, with practiced preci-
sion: "You can concentrate on multiple 
questions, but concentrate on each, one at 
a time." 

I take the cards and awkwardly begin 
to mix them. They are bigger than my 
hands, so I can't really shuffie them, but I 
keep cutting and restaclcing them. I try to 
concentrate on a question, bur one thought 
8ows into the next, and I concentrate on 
none, just mixing and remixing the cards. I 
rtalize I'm talcing quite a long time. I set

down the cards and laugh self-consciously. 
"Just trying to make sure I concentrate." 

Thea doesn't hear me. She is staring at 
a spot in the air somewhere. Donna's tarot 
flier says, "When the querent handles the 
cards, their energy is passed on through 
them ... whether they are barely touched by 
you or thoroughly shuffled, they will come 
out the way they are meant to." 

Thea walks me through an elaborate 
scheme to select a card. She considers it. 
"Hmmm .. .Is there something going on in 
your life, maybe something you're coming 
out of now? Some sort of negative person 
in your life?" Stammering, confused, I 
deflect, I postpone. "Ummm. What do you 
mean by 'happening'? I don't, uh, really 
know ... " 

In the face of my uncooperation, she 
proceeds. This card you picked represents 
the state of your life right now, she says, 
and reveals it: the Five of Crystals, 
Negativity. A strongly negative force is 
attached to me right now. She tries to soft-
en the blow, but I still reel from the diag-
nosis. I surrender myself for healing. 

In a flurry, she lays out 12 cards, a 
dizzying circle of images. She explains how 
each card hints at what may be coming in 
my life. It seems my current frustration will 
end with a period of spiritual death and 
rebirth, a "letting go" of things that trouble 
me. Now that she is practicing her exper-
tise, I feel more secure and put myself in 
her hands, earnestly offering up details so 
her analysis can be more accurate. She lis-
tens to my concerns. Reassurance from 
Donna's flier rings in my ears: "The cards 
can give you answers to questions, but we 
all have free will. If you are not happy with 
the reading, you can take steps to change 
things. I think of the cards as a guideline to 
the way things will happen if we continue 
to travel on the same path we are on." The 
problems I face all seem so manageable 
now. "Those are my business cards," Thea 
says. "Take one. If you need to talk some-
time, give me a call."
