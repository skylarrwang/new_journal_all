Hound help in a high-speed car chase, and 
if not, why did Flash ride shotgun with 
Roscoe P. Coltrain? Would Scooby have 
worked such long hours if it were not for 
Scooby Snacks? The Canine Training 
Center, located at the State Police 
Compound in Meriden, is where dogs 
learn to take a bite out of crime and where 
the layman can learn all there is to know 
about canine crimefighting. The walls of 
the compound are lined with plaques, tro-
phies and pictures of graduating classes of 
officers and their quadrapedal partners. 
Interspersed with portraits of officers from 
all over the country, are pictures of units 
from across the globe: Greek German 
Shepherds, Egyptian Labrador Retreivers, 
and Chilean Sabuesos de Sangre. 

Training is held twice a year, in the fall 
and in the spring. The 540-hour course is 
attended daily by dog and handler. About 
108 teams attend each training session. 
Currently, 63 State Police and 37 Local 
Police teams are being trained. Hades has 
its Cerberus, and when training is over the 
Department of Corrections will have 20 
new (one headed) employees. Yet, due to its 
intense nature, 50 percent of the dogs will 
not make it through the course, nor will 30 
percent of the humans, making a Yale edu-
cation look like a cake walk---94 percent of 
Yale students graduate within five years. 

Currently in their fourth week of 
training, the dogs are practicing obedience 
skills and beginning to learn specific 
~ponses to situational stimuli. For exam-
ple, in an exercise for patrol dogs, the dog 
is taught to chase a threatening person and 
pursue them into a building, by recreating 
the situation and giving the dog feedback 
for his behavior. This exercise is specific to 
patrol dogs, the most visible type of police 
dog. Patrol dogs, which were originally 
Bloodhounds but are now primarily 
German Shepherds (the breed featured in 
the Jim Belushi great, K9), are trained in 
areas such as "obedience, obstacle work, 
tracking, building search, handler protec-
tion and evidence recovery,'' boasts the 
Canine Unit's informational materials. 

The Center also trains specialty dogs 
for seem work. Dogs are trained to sniff 
OUt narcotics and explosives, and can be 
USed in search and rescue operations, along 
1rith disaster work. In fact, the Connecticut 
Stare Police Canine Unit recently respond-
ed to a call about a lost four-year-old girl 
and promptly found her at the bottom of a 
OcroaER. 15, 1999 
nearby pond and rescued her. Labrador and 
Golden Retrievers, initially bred to retrieve 
dead ducks, are most commonly employed 
for this type of rescue. 

The dogs are all pure-bred and are of 
varying ages and sizes, though they are pre-
dominantly male, since males have proved 
to be more suited to this type of work-
sadly there's not a Lady for every Tramp. 
The dogs are obtained in a variety of ways. 
Local breeders donate some of the dogs, as 
do overwhelmed families (Benji was cer-
tainly a handful now and again, as was 
Beethoven). Some dogs enter the center at 
age eight weeks, some at age four years, but 
the age range in the training session is 
about two to four years old. Dogs can work 
until they are about ten years old before 
they are compelled to retire. The brochures 
didn't mention a pension plan. 

The bond between the handler and his 
dog is a unique one. Here fiction and non-
fiction overlap: few would deny the power-
ful link between Lassie and Timmy, 
Columbo and Dog. The handler is taught 
to address the dog in either very high, pos-
itive tones of encouragement or low, nega-
tive tones of reproach. Hand motions are 
also used to give orders. Dogs see everyone 
but their masters as civilians, and are high-
ly defensive of their handler. Any action 
seen as aggression toward the handler is 
responded to immediately with growling 
and what the trainers call "bite hold." This 
is a defense mechanism in which the dog 
sinks his teeth into the aggressor and holds 
him there until he is told to release. 

With this kind of close contact, one 
would expect dogs to be injured often, yet 
the opposite is true. Dogs are rarely killed 
in action and seldom harmed. Moreover, 
the dog provides a preemptive defense for 
the handler. Handlers are less often con-
fronted or endangered while on patrol than 
other officers. Dog and handler work 
together in a union as sacred as that of the 
tragically short-lived relationship between 
the Fox and the Hound. 

But this relationship is not for any 
dog-or for any human. To be qualified 
even to enter the rigorous training pro-
gram, an officer must serve with the state 
troopers for 2 years and pass the same testS 
of health, mental well-being and physical 
strength that dogs must-but they have to 
do it on only two legs.
