four that followed oversimplified the legal 
issues involved. Four absentee ballots filed 
by alumni had been thrown out before the 
election. That left 30 contested votes. 
Within that number, the YDN lumped 
together a group of students that included 
not just freshmen, but fresh~en coun-
selors, off-campus students, and juniors 
studying abroad. Freshmen alone were 
mentioned specifically and quoted as vot-
ers, when in fact only 14 freshmen voted in 
the election. The laws covering former res-
idents of Ward 7 and future residents of 
Ward 7 are different; the former has to do 
with a change of address, the latter, with 
the definition of the term "bona fide resi-
dency." 

This definition is harder to apply than 
it may at first seem. The law defines "bona 
fide residence" as an individual's "fixed 
home or fixed place of abode, to which, 
when he is temporarily absent, he intends 
to return." 

"To determine the particular resi-
dence," the law continues, "objective fac-
tors must substantiate a subjective declara-
tion of intention." What are these "objec-
tive factors"? What is a "subjective declara-
tion of intention"? Even Mary Young. the 
staff attorney of the Secretary of State's 
office, admits, "The law does!l't say any-
thing. The statutes do not spell out what 
'bona fide resident' means." 

According to Gosar's reasoning, a Yale 
freshman's "bona fide residence" is the resi-
dential college. "You establish residence in 
your residential college," he said. "It's 
where you eat, where your mailing address 
is. They will live there when I'm the alder-
man." 

Gosar chose not to elaborate on this 
position in articles after the election. "The 
Daily wanted me to give my story," he said. 
â€¢1 didn't want to speak to them because 
they were doing a terrible job of covering 
the election and they were trying to scan-
dalize everything. I was hoping people 
would see it as a form of social protest. 
Also, there was pending legal action. I 
couldn't talk, I didn't want to talk." Instead, 
he e-mailed YDN reporters and editors with 
people and evidence supporting his side, 
including the name and number of Sean 
Grace, a member of the 27th Democratic 
Ward Committee who ran for alderman in 
1995. Grace claims he called the YDN to 
warn them against taking Tom Ferguson's 
word as law and to point them toward
