buzzing ceases. 

My destiny is clear, but I choose to delay it. I pass to the left, 
where two Asian men in starched red robes with black calligraphy 
work on a man stretched out on a table. One rhythmically pumps 
the man's chest and stomach; the other, his legs. They breathe force-
fully, with mechanical regularity--one in long "swooosh"s, the 
other with quick "hoof hoof hoof"s. In the rhythm of these three, 
pulsating as one being, throbs the heartbeat of this lonely room. 
A brochure proclaims this process to be a Ki (Energy) treat-
ment, "Your Chance to Create Your Own Health and Well-Being." 
The brochure explains the metaphysics of the process. "lG is nor 
only the basic component of matter, bur also the mind of matter. 
Thus everything one thinks and feels is transmitted to the body via 
the energy system. When there is harmony between body and 
mind, the energy flows smoothly, but when there is discord, it 
becomes blocked, which eventually leads to disease." Will I allow 
my energy to be unblocked? Will I rebalance my earth and heaven 
energies? "When all the energy channels that connect with heaven 
energy and all the energy channels that connect with earth energy 
are open, we begin to receive the original energy that created life. 
This energy has the power to renew cells, regenerate all the body 
functions, and return the mind to its original state of goodness and 
beauty." Will I allow my mind to return, to be beautiful and good? 
I glance at the man in the center, who still seems to be looking 
at me. On the end of his table are more fliers. I feel drawn to read 
them, or at least ro approach the cable. "Would you like to make an 
appointment with one of our psychics?" Ah, perhaps this is why I 


At an adjacent table, I find Daniel Brener, M.s., an aro-
matherapist. He tells me that certain essences in plan~sential 
oils--can affect people's emotional and physical health. Kind of like 
a combination ofProzac and Vicks Nasal Spray, I wonder? His Bier 
explains the benefits of rosemary essential oil. "Exhilarating, pene-
trating, activating. Stimulates the brow chakra (third eye/pineal 
gland). Enhances mental clarity, concentration, memory, and cre-
ativity. Useful for studying, computer work, and all intellectually 
demanding pursuits. Helps clear negative energy from one's aura 
and environment; has a 'protective' quality. Promotes self-
confidence, courage, determination. Beneficial for the liver, gall-
bladder, immune and respiratory systems ... excellent for wounds 
and burns. Stimulates hair growth ... " 
Bur for me Brener suggests a scent based on my astrological 
sign, Capricorn. He tells me that Capricorns typically have prob-
lems with their bones and joints, especially knees. "Do you have 
problems with your knees?" he asks. "Well, yes," I say. "Bur only 
from running." Of course, only from running. 

If I won't let my knee problem be cured, he can still make me 
a personal scent. I can come to his shop, and he will have me smell 
a selection of scents. The ones most beneficial to my body will nat-
urally attract me. Once I find a group of six or so that I like, he'll 
blindfold me to remove other stimuli for the final selection process, 
have me smell them again, and from the final three concoct an odif-
erous medication. This process isn't like going into a pharmacy and 
doing shots until discovering the right medicine. These medications
