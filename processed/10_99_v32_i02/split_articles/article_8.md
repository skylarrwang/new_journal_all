**A Double Murder, a Framed Man, and a Corrupt Cop?**
**Author:  Not specified**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

An FBI report su~~ests two men were framed by a local drug boss-
and a police detective. 

n October 11, 1990, a bullet to the head killed 
Ricardo Turner. His lover, Lamont Fields, was 
killed by two shots in the back. Within 15 min-
utes the police discovered the bodies. Within seven 
months, Scott Lewis and Stephan Morant were con-
victed of the double murder and began serving rime 
for a crime they say they did not commit. 

Certain facts of the case are uncontested. The 
shootings, which occurred sometime after 4 AM in 
Turner and Fields' 634 Howard Avenue apartment, 
were a result of New Haven's thriving drug scene and-
its economy of competition and debt. A former 
city alderman, Turner had started dealing 
cocaine when he lost his seat in the rnid-
1980s. 

According to friends, he believed 
someone in his Hill neighborhood drug circle 
was stalking him and feared for his life in the 
months leading up to the murder. 

On October n, his fears were realized. A 
neighbor recalls hearing muffied voices arguing. 
followed by what she inirialJy took to be some-
one hammering nails, and then the footsteps of 
at least two people running from the building. 
Authorities maintain 
that 
these footsteps 
belonged to Lewis and his accomplice Morant, 
but Lewis continues to proclaim his innocence from 
a cell at the Cheshire Correctional Institution, where he 
is serving a 12.0 year sentence. Unsurprisingly, the state and Lewi~ 
tell very different stories about Lewis' activities on the day of the 
murder. 

The state's account is based primarily on the testimony of dtenÂ· 
teenage drug dealer Ovil Ruiz: around midnight Lewis, Morant and 
Ruiz were loitering on Clay Sueet in Fa.ir Haven when Frank Parise 
approached them. 

An Italian drug boss, Parise ran a thriving 
cocaine operation our of Branford and hired young blacks and 
Latinos--among them Ruiz, Lewis and Morant-to deal for him 
on the street. Parise spoke to the men about Turner and left, at 
which time Morant yelled, "Get the guns. We're going to the Hill." 

Before driving to New Haven's blighted Hill neighborhood, the uio 
smoked marijuana and drank in an after-hours bar. Around 4 AM, 
they arrived at Turner's apartment and Lewis and Morant entered 
with revolvers, while Ruiz remained in the car. Gunshots sounded, 
and Lewis and Morant ran from the building with a Puma gym bag 
and a bank deposit bag. As Ruiz drove the men back to Clay Street, 
he heard them comment that they had done "what they had to do." 

Lewis does not deny that he dealt cocaine for Parise. But he 
tells a different story about his activities on October u: Lewis says 
8 
he l an all-night =h job ft>< the pho~e company" 
"' Minuteman Press, and witnesses suppc\rt his account. 
j 
s, an athletic black man, 2.4 years old at the time, loved Jhf 
work at the printing press, even though it Raid only $Wah 
e had learned the trade at Eli Whitney Techri1C3f5di00t'in 
New Haven and had worked for several presses before Minuteman 
hired him in the late 198os. 

In 1989 Lewis found a job that paid 
much better, earning up to $4000 a week, or sometimes even in a 
single day: dealing cocaine. 

But Lewis continued printing--he 
enjoyed the work and believed it kept him "legit." 

Jeffrey Rochler, the owner of Minuteman, has called Lewis "a 
dependable employee who did a better than average job as a print-
er." And, Rochler says, Lewis was at the press when the double 
murder occurred. According to Rochler, the only rime Lewis left 
Minuteman Press on October n was at 1 AM when he went home to 
eat. Upon his return at 2., Lewis stayed at work until 7 that morn-
ing. Other co-workers confirm this account. 

But the jury didn't believe Lewis when be took the stand and 
relayed this timetable of events. They believed the state. Lewis was, 
after all, a drug-dealer with prior convictions for robbery and nar-
cotics possession. Why would the jury members believe his account 
THE NEW JouRNAL 

over police statements, believe his testimony over that of a state wit-
ness? 

The jury might, however, have asked why Lewis's co-workers at 
the Minuteman Press were never interviewed by police. Rochler 
asked to make an official statement, but police never acknowledged 
his request. 

RochJer did receive an unofficial visit from Police 
Detective Vincent Raucci who said not to mention their meeting. 

Or the jury might have wondered why the state never tested 
blood found in the hallway in Turner's building. Though police ini-
tially said the blood belonged to the killer, they later dismissed it as 
the victims' and ran no tests. The State also f.Uied to produce any 
fingerprints or other tangible evidence implicating Lewis. 

The jurors might have asked themselves why they judged the 
prosecution's principal witness-<irug dealer and convicted criminal 
Ovil Ruiz-more credible than Lewis. 

Ruiz had a history of 
lying-he lied to get a f.U<e 1.0. and used various aliases, even with 
the police. While in jail Ruiz was heavily medicated on antipsy-
chotic drugs, including Thorazine and Haldol. He told authorities 
that he saw a devil in his cell and heard voices, a complaint he later 
said he fabricated to be kept in sqlitary confinement. It is unclear 
..,hether Ruiz was mentally ill or merely a masterful liar. Either way, 
he was hardly an ideal witness. 

Finally, the jury might have wondered why the initial prime 
awpect in the murders was let go so easily. In November 1990, a 
trusted street informant told Police Sgt. Francisco Ortiz that 
Michael Cardwell was responsible for the double murder. Cardwell 
did indeed sell drugs with Turner and apparently owed Turner 
$48,ooo. But the police conducted only a perfunctory investigation 
of Cardwell. When he skipped town, authorities did not pursue 
him. 

Taken together, these faets cast significant doubt on Lewis and 
Morant's guilt. Why, then, were they convicted in a quick two-
week trial? Lewis has a theory, one supported by an FBI report 
released by the Connecticut State Attorney this September. Lewis 
and Morant were framed: framed by Parise, to punish Lewis, one of 
his dealers, for debt; and framed by Parise's partner-former New 
Haven Police Detective Vincent Raucci. 

Born and raised in Fair Haven, then 34-year-old Raucci had 
police work in his blood. Upon graduating from high school, he 
followed the careers of his father, grandfather, uncle and great 
uncles and joined the North Haven Police Department. In 1981, 
New Haven police welcomed Raucci to their force. Raucci was an 
lgressive, street-smart cop who prided himself on using intellect 
and instinCts, not just intimidation. Well-liked in the community 
and praised by the police chief, Raucci was named Officer of the 
Year by New Haven's Cirywide Block Watch Association in 1986. 

But in 1996, Raucci lefr the force, facing charges oflarceny and 
0crosER 15, 1999 
domestic abuse. While on the police force, Raucci received federal 
a. 
money to work as a security guard at a Newhall ville housing pro jeer i. 
for the elderly. During these hours he was actually meeting his girl-
~ 
friend at the Hamden Howard Johnson's. The state found out the 
Cl> !l 
true nature of Raucci's "overtime work" and pressed charges. 

en 
Ql 
Raucci was also arrested for abusing his ex-wife. Further police ; 
':T 
investigation revealed that he had been doing cocaine and fre-
!r 
quenting drug houses. On April n , 1996, Raucci chose to retire and co 
iii 
receive a disability pension of $2.8,ooo a year rather than fight the 5. 
charges against him. But the charges haven't disappeared. 

This past July, FBI agents arrested Raucci on the outstanding 
Connecticut warrants for larceny and domestic abuse. The first 
time the FBI came to his New Mexico mobile home, Raucci hid. 
The second time, he surrendered afrer a four-hour standoff, and the 
FBI dragged Raucci back to New Haven, ostensibly to clear up the 
outstanding charges. But they had another motive: along with local 
cops, FBI agents planned to question him about the 1990 double 

Lewis had sparked FBI involvement in the case in 1996, while 
incarcerated at the Cheshire Correctional Institution. 
Federal 
agents spent a year investigating and conducting interviews, travel-
ing as far as Arizona to speak to witnesses, resulting in a provocative 
report about the murders. 

But the report gives no easy answers. Michael Fitzpatrick, 
Morant's attorney, says, "It's obvious the title 'report' is a misnomer. 
It is really a series of interviews stapled together with a cover page." 

To construct a coherent account of the murders, the reader must 
extract necessary information, piece together discrepant statements, 
and keep track of a cast of characters with names like "Bullet" and 
"Mac Tonight." 

Despite its ultimate inconclusiveness, the FBI 
report contains powerful evidence, evidence that could possibly free 
Lewis and Morant and land Raucci in jail for life. 

Take, for example, the claims of several wimesses that Raucci 
coerced them into giving false statements. New Haven cocaine 
dealer Hector Ortiz says Raucci forced him to give a statement 
against Scott Lewis in return for protection from another criminal 
charge. Ortiz gave the statement in Raucci's police car, with Raucci 
turning off the tape recorder to coach him. Raucci also pointed out 
the pieture Ortiz should seleet on the photoboard of suspects-
Scott Lewis'. On the stand at Lewis' trial, Ortiz refused to repeat 
the statement Raucci had taken, declaring that Raucci had coerced 
him. But the jury didn't believe Ortiz. He was, afrer all, a youpg 
drug dealer wanted on other charges. 

Ortiz was not the only wimess pressured to give false testimo-
ny. Another man tells a similar story-Raucci, he says, forced him 
to give a fabricated statement implicating Lewis, which he deliv-
ered, with coaching. in Raucci's police car. And a young woman
