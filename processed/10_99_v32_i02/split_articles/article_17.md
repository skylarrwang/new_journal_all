This fall, the Eli Whitney Folk Festival returned to Edgerton 
Park after a five-year hiatus. The festival had obviously been 
missed: local community members and student enthusiasts cov-
ered the park with their picnic blankets. Yale's own folk group 
Tangled Up In Blue opened for headliners Dar Williams and 
Odetta. Festival organizers emphasized the meaning of the word 
ufolk" and its connection to the gathering of people who had 
come to the park to join in the artistic movement of the same 
name. uFolk" has no singular form; these photographs of a man, 
a youth and a boy focus on individuals always fn the crowd.
