n 2000, a student walked into the 
lobby 
of 
Yale's 
Undergraduate · 
Career Services and asked how to 
become a puppeteer. "This guy wanted 
a certain salary, certain benefits," recalls 
.
Phil Jones, the director of UCS since 
1999. ''"We put a counselor to work on it 
and ended up with tons of information 
on puppeteering positions. It's rare, but 
every once in a while a student hits us 
with something new." 
Seated in his office at 55 . Whitney 
Avenue, UCS' base of operations for the 
. past seven years, Jones exudes confidence. 
British and heavily bearded, he has faith 
in his department's ability to smooth over 
the potentially harrowing experience of 
securing employment after nearly two 
decades of uninterrupted schooling. He 
is quick to champion the professional 
prowess of Yalies independent of UCS' 
involvement. "The greatest fear I hear 
from the students who come here is 
that they're not going to get jobs," he 
says. "That's ridiculous. In a competitive 
market, the most competitive people are

going to get the jobs, and the smartest 
people tend to . be the most competitive. 
And where are the smartest people?" He 
pauses, and leans forward conspiratorially 
in his armchajr. "The smartest people are 
here!" 
·
And 
yet, despite their intelligence, 
his clients are considerably less sanguine. 
From the oft-quoted complaint of UCS' 
favoritism towards investment bankers 
and consulting firms to the prohibitive 
expense 
its 
overseas 
Bulldogs 
programs, not all students sing the praises 
of their Whitney Avenue advocates. 
Despite 
UCS' 
undeniably 
daunting 
resources 
an expansive alumni network, 
a seemingly endless cycle of specialized 
-
seminars, and a sizeable and well-trained 
staff Yalies continue to write off the 
service as impersonal, limited in scope, 
and lacking in the kind of capabilities that 
New Haven's hotbed of precocious pre-
professionals really wants: 
Jones uses the story of the puppeteer 
to illustrate the open-mindednes.s of 
the 0ffice he runs, but the tale raises 
questions of its own. Who really pulls the 
strings at UCS? Is it big-name firms like 
Morgan Stanley and. JPM9rgan, whose 
high turnover rates requjre a constant 
influx of fresh Ivy League blood? Is 
it the Yale administration, pushing its 
undergraduates to enter lucrative fields 
and seek prestigious positions? Or is it 
the students themselves, increasingly · 
concerned 
about 
their 
professional 
futures as graduation approaches, yet 
wary of abandoning the cushy confines 
of college far the monetary crush of the 
marketplace? 
Jones' answer is unequivocal: "I don't 
care what you do," he explains. "Our role 
here is to challenge students about what 
they want from a career. What's your 
criteria?" Indeed, since he acquired his post 
in 1999,Jones has taken sweeping steps to 
broaden UCS' interactions with students, 
allowing what was once a Wall Street

clearing-house to cater more and more 
to individualized interests and courses 
of study. "The important thing is sitting 
down one-on-one with undergraduates 
and discussing their future," he maintains. 
"It's going to be different for everyone." 
Before Jones took the helm at UCS, there 
were no counseling appointments. Now, 
the office accommodates roughly five 
thousand meetings a year. 
This personal contactis Jones' response 
to his concerns over the deceptive ease 
of applying for positions in the age .of 
Internet commerce. "It's a kind of tunnel 
vision students have," he says, "like if 
it's all online, people can just furrow 
the path that's in their head. Somebody 
walked in here once and literally asked 
for our list of jobs." Jones does not see 
providing laundry lists and sign-up sheets 
as his responsibility. He contends that the 
road to the perfect career is one students 
must follow on the strength of their own 
ambition. UCS can· provide direction and 
advice, but does not aim to fence clients 
into the field of their dreams. The service, 
in Jones' words, "specializes in the totally 
clueless." 
But in drawing a distinction between 
monomaniacal pre-professionals and the 
desperately aimless, UCS misses what may 
be the most sizeable demographic of all: 
students with a pretty clear idea of their 
career goals, but not the faintest sense 
of how to achieve them. Bevan Dowd, 
a senior Literature major, unsuccessfully 
attempted to locate a writing or publishing 
internship through UCS for the summer 
between her sophomore-and junior years. 
When repeated searches proved fruitless, 
she decided to take matters into her own 
hands. 'Cj_ spent a lot of time on the UCS 
website," she explains, "but there just 
wasn't enough variety." Frustrated, Dowd 
went home and Googled "magazine 
internship New York City." She sent 
her resume to the first hit and spent 
the summer employed by a small food 
magazine. Her work involved, among 
other editorial duties, tracking down the 
top ten apple pies of the Big Apple. 
"I think the biggest problem with 
UCS is that a lot of people just- find 
them unapproachable," says Dowd. ''I 
know that they're trying to change the 
image that they're just for consulting 
and banking jobs, but that message isn't 
reaching students." Contrary to Jones' 
December 2007 
conjecture, Dowd identifies most Yalies' 
professional anxiety as aggravated not 
by the uncertainty of finding a job, any 
job, but by the daunting quest to locate 
the "perfect fit" career. "UCS is a good . 
resource," she says, "and it makes Yale 
unique. But the complications that arise 
in a job search can't be assuaged by a 
service so many ~tudents see as tied up in 
a limited array of fields." 
Even those in pursuit of positions at 
investment banks and consulting firms 
acknowledge the system's limitations. 
' 
Andriana Diez, a senior who will work 
for JPMorgan next year, praises the 
organizational 
abilities 
UCS. 
''I _ 
couldn't imagine going through the job 
search without UCS," explains Diez. 
"One week I had 13 interviews. If it 
hadn't been for them, I would have been 
out of school for a week." Still, Diez is 
quick to point out that a student's opinion 
of the organization depends largely on 
the career she chooses and the qua1ity 
of her counseling sessions, which can 
vary widely. ''I feel like U CS is really 
underappreciated on campus," she says. 
''But how people feel about the program 
generally goes along with whether or not 
it helped them personally." 
Olga Berlinsky, another senior with 
a job offer from a top consulting firms 
agrees. "Last year, I was applying to 
some banking internships and set up an 
appointment at UCS to_ talk about finance 
interviews," recalls Berlinsky. "The first 
question the UCS person asked me was, 
'Are you really interested in this stuff, or 
are you just doing it because it's being 
thrown at you?' That really surprised 
me." 
Jones' commitment to diversifying 
UCS' appeal beyond simple schedu1ing 
and headhunting has been at least partia11y 
effective. Their counselors are asking the 
right questions, but the jury is out on 
whether they are helpful ''My impression 
is that UCS isn't really the place to get 
direction," comments Berlinsky. ''I think 
there are plenty of other resources at 
Yale, like friends, professors, and deans, 
that are more suited than UCS at helping 
you answer those general life questions." 
question of the puppeteer remains. 
Just how willing is UCS to tackle the 
unprecedented and the absurd, to assist 
students· with ambitions well beyond the 
realm of the immediately feasible? Jones, 
during our conversation, noted that the 
"hardest thing for Yale students is that 
. there really isn't anything they can't do." I

wondered just how far UCS' definition of 
"anything" extended, and decided to find 
out firsthand whether something more 
akin to Pinocchio than puppeteering was 
at work in the director's tale. 
After scheduling a standard thirty-
minute appointment, I made my way to 
UCS' Whitney Avenue headquarters and 
waited in the lobby for my counselor to 
appear. Before long, an affable red-haired 
woman emerged from behind a cubicle 
and shook my hand. We exchanged 
pleasantries 
where was I from, what 
was my major? 
and proceeded to her 
office. 
"So what brings you here today?" she 
asked, leaning over the desk. 
"It might sound a bit strange," I 
said, "but I'm looking for a job as a 
taxidermist." 
The counselor scrunched her eyes 
inquisitively, but appeared 
otherwise 
nnfazed. Turning to her computer, she 
began to pore through UCS' vast database 
of alumni contacts. A quick search of the 
listings yielded no matches. Moving over 
to a compilation of job postings, the 
counselor brought my attention to a pull-
down list of career categories. 
''We can take a look at Environment 
and 
Preservation," 
she 
exp]ained. 
''Taxidermy is a kind of preservation, I 
guess." When this too failed to produce a 
hit, the counselor rotated in her chair to 
face me. Scribbling notes on a steno pad, 
she lifted her eyes to meet mine. 
"Have you tried a random Google 
search?"
