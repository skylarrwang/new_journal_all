Once the Yale School of Music renovates Hendrie Hall, students will be able to ride an elevator to practice rooms like this one. 
headquarters, Leigh Hall, from atop 
Manhattan's 
I jncoln 
Center. 
Highly 
endowed, located in the heart of New 
York City, it attracts top talents who are 
willing to pay. "How are you going to get 
the-attention of someone in Japan next to 
the Juilliard?" Duffy asks. 

A hundred million dollars might do it. 
It;1ternational media quickly picked up the 
story and the New York Times ran articles 
debating the gift's impact on the future of 
classical music. In the fall of 2005, the rate 
of applications to the School of Music 
doubled to nearly fifteen hundred a year. 
Its admit rate halved to 8 percent while its 
yield rose from 70 to 83 percent. Over 40 
percent of the School of Music's students 
are now international, far more than at 
any other school within the University. 
Aside from Yale, 
only a 
single 
conservatory in the country, the Curtis 
Institute in Philadelphia, offers free 
enrollment, and many music schools 
around the world are heading in the 
other direction. "Most of the prospective 
28 
' applicants we meet during our recruiting 
· efforts are already aware of the full-tuition 
scholarship, so it is usually not necessary 
to even mention it," said Daniel Pellegrini, 
the School's director of admissions. Levin 
himself has noted the effect, saying that 
"free tuition has made possible attracting 
international students who would not 
have considered Yale without strong 
financial support." 

To some degree, the quest for 
international students is a search for quality . 
musicians. "Our goal has always been to 
find the best and brightest in the world 
and bring them to Yale," Blo<::ker said. 
"There's no question that the standard is 
different," said Friedmann of the post-
donation admissions. "The quality of 
every single instrument 
they're more 
polished, they're more proficient. We have 
some superstars here. This was out of the 
question in the past." But it is impossible 
to ignore the School of Music's place in 
Yale's ongoing embrace of globalization. 
The gift has enabled the University to 
expand an already impressive collection 
of partnerships with institutions around 
the globe, among them a concert series 
with the Royal Academy in London and 
a slate of programs in Asia (especially 
China) 
that includes 
this 
summer's 
Cultural Olympiad. Levin is confident 
that these collaborations will raise the 
University's profile 
"in the music world, 
but also more generally." 

Other 
perks 
of 
the 
increased 
endowment have come effortlessly. ''All 
these things start drawing togethet:," said 
Blocker. ''You get a big gift and you have 
resources that enable you to see how 
those oppor tunities might open up." The 
School of Music was able to take over 
Yale's Collection of Musical Instruments 
and began to hold classes and concerts 
with 
students 
playing on Wagner's 
piano and 17th-Century virginals. In July, 
there w.iJl be a musical theater and jazz 
program for New Haven public schools. 
The School is holding a yearlong series 
of concerts by students and faculty at

Carnegie Hall in New York 
already the 
subject of multiple rave reviews by the 
New York Times 
presenting students 
with life-changing opportunities to be 
seen and heard. 

Hendrie Hall is the last of the School 
Music's 
unrenovated, 
run-down 
behemoths. This relic, from an era in which 
Yale was, as Fa~sler described it, "the land 
of the peeling paint," is the School's last 
egregiously necessary project. Once it is 
completed, the school's next aim appears 
to be to raise enough money to award 
significant cost-of-living stipends to each 
of its students. "I would imagine another 
$100 to $200million will solve the stipend 
issue," said Duffy. Blocker who in 
his time at Yale has brought in at least 
$200 million in endowment money is 
a born fundraiser. When I asked him 
what motivates a donor to give $100 
million to the school, he smiled at me 
ingratiatingly and said, "I think there's the 
same motivation for a young alum such as 
yourself. When you graduate, Mitch, start 
giving right away." 

ndergraduates lost their claim to all 
__.. of this in 1940. The School of Music, 
which was founded in 1894 through a gift 
from some of Yale's great .19th-century 
benefactors, the Battells, initially awarded 
degrees 
to 
undergraduates, 
doctoral 
students, and performers. Music schools, 
however, are notorious 
~esspools of 
acrimony, especially between professors 
of competing disciplines, . and Yale's 
was beset by frequent complaints from 
undergraduates, historians, and theorists, 
who felt they were underappreciated next 
to the performers. Luther N oss, a School 
of Music dean in the 19 50s, who later 
becameitsurtofficialcourthistorian,recalls 
the state of the split of 1939. "For over 
a year there had been audible grumblings 
in the Yale College commUnity over what 
was felt to be, rightly or wrongly, the 
School's lack of interest and cooperation 
in tending to the academic and practical 
musical needs of the undergraduates." 
David Stanley Smith, the dean at the time, 
recommended that the School of Music 
satisfy its undergraduates by expanding its 
library of phonograph records, enlarging 
its faculty, and permitring students to 
study a broader liberal arts curriculum. 
Instead, 
Yale 
President 
Charles 
Seymour established the Department 
December 2007 
Robert Blocker is dean of the School of Music 
of Music, moving the scholars and their 
graduate students, along with all the 
undergraduates, to the new department. 
The professional school was left, as 
it remains, a home for professors of 
performance, composers, and graduate 
musicians. Even today, few will argue 
with the separation. ''It's absolutely a 
good division," said Daniel Harrison, the 
current chair of the music department. 
At schools without separate departments, 
Harrison said, "the scholarly components 
are generally undernourished compared to 
performers. They're the breadwinners." 

One irony it that, despite the firewall 
between the two schools, outsiders are 
generally unaware of the difference; 
in the weeks after the School of Music 
received its $100 million, the Department 
of Music fielded dozens of calls from 
prospective applic~ts confusing it with · 
the professional school. The department 
has 
also 
encountered 
significant 
fundraising difficulties now that donors 
mistakenly believe that Yale's entire music 
program is already fabulously wealthy. 
In reality, the department is by far 
the less wealthy of the two. ''Financially, 
we're a poor stepsister to the School," 
said Harrison. The music department 
enjoys only a tiny piece of the Uni ersity's 
endowment and must rely mainly on the 
generosity of the central administration 
and on targeted grant for its research 
and special projects. Sarah Wei s, an 
assistant professor of ethnomu icology, 
described the "treasure hunt' of winning 
University grants, petitioning the central 
administration, asking the department, 
and discovering hidden pockets of 
resources to fund projects, events, and 
performances. "It's one of the things I 
like best about Yale," she said. "It means 
that no one has ultimate control over 
something except the person who puts 
it together." A further irony: while the 
School of Music made news worldwide for 
granting free enrollment to its students, it 
has always been de rigueur for the University 
to award full tuition and cost-of-living 
stipends to every one of the more than 
three hundred doctoral students it admits 
annually, six to twelve of whom are music 
theorists and historians. 

The greatest irony, however, is the 
fate of undergraduate performers, music 
majors or otherwise, who are drawn to 
Yale by its well-deserved reputation for 
a rich musical culture. Overseen by the 
Department of Music, undergraduates 
have limited interaction with the wealthy 
professional school and soon discover 
that too few of the be,o.efits trickle 
down to their own educations in music. 
Nearly seventy years after their secession 
from an uncaring professional school, 
undergraduate musicians are still seeking 
the respect they deserve.

onsider undergraduate ensembles 
-at Yale. Junior Kate Swisher is 
assistant conductor of the Davenport 
Pops Orchestra. The group, founded 
by students in the spring of 2005 and 
modestly supported by Davenport College, 
is an integral part of what Harrison called 
the "fairly developed spectrum of music 
at Yale." An upstart group just as the Yale 
Symphony Orchestra, Yale Concert Band, 
and Glee Club once were, the Davenport 
Pops offers someone like Swisher, who 
hopes to pursue a career in performance, 
invaluable opportunities to conduct a full 
orchestra. Unfortunately, Yale offers her 
hardly anywhere to do it. 

"The School of Music won't rent 
space to undergrads," Swisher said. ''If 
you want to perform in Woolsey, it eats up 
your entire Sudler fund for the semester." 
The cost to reserve Woolsey for a night is, 
in fact, closer to 1,800, far more than the 
five-hundred-dollar Sudler grants available 
for student concerts. Battell Chapel is not 
much 
c~eaper. Swisher addressed her 
criticism toward the University: "You 
want us to perform, you want to support

the arts, but you won't give us a space to 
perform or rehearse." 

Though the Yale Symphony Orchestra 
is 
one of 
the best undergraduate 
orchestras in the country and a group that 
several undergraduate musicians identify 
as the reason they chose to attend Yale, it 
does not fare much better. The University 
generally supplies around 30 percent of 
YSO's annual budget of approximately 
$100,000, which does not include travel 
expenses. 'We are expected to raise money 
for ourselves," said Toshiyuki Shimada, the 
orchestra's professional conductor. ''We 
have to rent Woolsey Hall, believe it or 
not." Funds for YSO come from benefit 
concerts, regular fundraising, and ticket 
revenues. Shimada said that Harrison 
is "very helpful spiritually, morally. But 
we do not get a tremendous amount of 
money fror•• the departtnent." 

Shimada and his orchestra would like 
to tour annually, but the group can only 
travel once every other year; fundraising 
can pay for only so many $250,000 tours 
" 
to Europe. Student volunteers must

ln'theory, Yale does care about these 
ensembles. According to Duffy, the 
current director of university bands, 
"Richard Levin is a tremendous supporter 
of music." It was Levin, after all, who 
played an indispensable role in steering 
the $100 mi11ion toward the School of 
Music, Levin who can take substantial

in the music department. It is unlikely, 
however, that the University's substantial 
fundraising apparatus, currently engaged in 
a multibillion dollar capital campaigri' the 
very apparatus that was able to launch the 
School of Music to the sky 
would not be 
able to stop charging its ensembles for a 
concert space that it allows the New Haven 
Symphony Orchestra to use for free.
