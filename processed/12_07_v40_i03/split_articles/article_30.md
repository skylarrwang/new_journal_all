about doing it. She started crying on the 
phone and asked me not to do it. It was 
Mother's Day and her birthday, and she 
asked me not to do it as a gift to her." 
While he ultimately decided not. to 
participate, G.tay believes the experiment 
is safe. "They're pretty careful about past 
history of psychosis and depression and 
stuf£ They were pretty open about the 
whole procedure. I didn't feel deceived or 
anything.'' 
"Participants 
are-
screened 
very 
carefully 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
psychological 
and 
physical 
health," 
Krystal confirms. ''We believe that this 
may be a reason that ketamine has been 
so safe in our studies and in the studies 
conducted by our colleagues around the 
world." While ketamine alters judgement 
and perception, it can, says Krystal, "be 
studied safely in people who have been 
prepared for its effects, who are supervised 
by people who have experience in dealing 
with symptoms that it produces, and 
when it is administered in a setting that is 
safe and comfortable." 


Sanacora similarly emphasizes the 
relative safety of ketamine. ''It's been 
around for quite a while," he says. ''It can 
raise blood pressure, but otherwise it is 
pretty well-tolerated." 


December 2007 
Jerald Block is a Washington-based 
psychiatrist who has criticized some of 
Yale's past human experiment policies-
particularly a recent clinical trial on 
Zyprexa, a medication designed to treat 
schizophrenia that was administered to 
adolescents over a period of several years. 
He views human testing as a balancing 
act. "I don't think researchers go into 
their studies trying to deceive people," 
he says. "Rather, we can get excited by a 
concept, lose perspective, and may take it 
too far. That is the role of Institutional 
Review Boards . to rein people in a 
bit. It is a tough balance. If the IRB is 
too intrusive, they hold back important 
research and people are harmed. If they 
are too loose ... people can also get hurt." 


Nonetheless, 
Block, who has not 
specifically investigated Yale's ketamine 
experiments, sees potential in the drug. 
"I do not know the protocol so I cannot 
address it, specifically," he says. "However, · 
I will say that ketamine is interesting ... 
the literature seems to indicate some 
rather amazing data coming out on the 
use of ketamine in treating depression. 
So, it is an important substance to study 
and has the potential for a breakthrough 
discovery." 


For others, the touted safety of such a 
study is not enough to convince them to 
participate. Michelle Castaneda, a friend 
of Gray's who became concerned after 
she learned of his plans to participate 
in the experiment, called her father, a 
professor at New York University School 
of Medicine and Director of Inpatient 
Psychiatry 
at Bellevue 
Psychiatric 
Hospital in New York, to ask him his 
opinion on the subject. 


"He did some reading on it, and said 
ketamine testing seemed pretty safe and 
pretty legitimate, but when I asked him if 
he would ever let me do it, he told me 
'never, ever, ever, ever, ever."' 


Nikolaidis, a psychology major who 
nins a lab in which he conducts non-
dmg-related psychology experiments on 
volunteers of his own, defends the testing. 
''I could not have imagined a more well-run 
study," he says. ''I think in terms of having 
my best interest at heart, I could not have 
imagined better researchers." Nikolaidis 
admits that he could be exceptional in his 
willingness to lend his mind to science. ''It 
might just be me," he says, "but I'm just 
curious about drugs."
