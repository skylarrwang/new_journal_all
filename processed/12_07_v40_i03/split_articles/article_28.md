facility to participate in the double-blind 
study. With electrodes on his head, an IV in 
his left arm to draw blood, and another in 
his right arm to administer a combination 
of saline solution, ketamine, and nicotine, 
Yale researchers recorded his brain waves 
using an electroencephalogram (EEG) 
test and monitored his vital signs. Twice 
he was given a placebo; twice he was given 
an injection of ketamine, once by itself 
and once in combination with nicotine. 
''Words 
couldn't 
describe 
what 
happened," Nikolaidis says. ''I thought 
that when it was over I would be able 
to describe it to people, but I found 
myself complet~ly unable to describe my 
experience. It was much more on a tactile 
level than cerebral 
I just mean cerebral 
in the sense of being rational."

His 
difficulty 
explaining 
the 
experience is not unusual: ketamine, 
originally invented bf pharmacist Calvin 
Stevens in 1962 as an anesthetic, has 
strong dissociative properties, affecting 
both the hippocampus (a region of the 
brain associated with memory) and the 
prefrontal cortex (associated with abstract 
thought). While it has a number of 
medical uses, ketamine has been known to 
induce near-death experiences, cognitive 
distortion, hallucinations, and the so-
called "I<-Hole," a state of drug-induced 
paralysis. "It was definitely interesting," 
says Nikolaidis. 
By tripping on ketamine, Nikolaidis 
may have participated in some of the 
most important psychopharmacological 
research 
in 
decades. 
These 
tests, 
conducted by the Yale School of Medicine 
on otherwise healthy subjects, may be the 
key to revolutionary new treatments for 
illnesses ranging from clinical depression 
to schizophrenia. One student's K-Hole 
may be several million's door to a life of 
relative normalcy. 
ale's ketamine research dates back 
to the late 1980s and has been 
innovative in a number of ways. When 
used to treat mental disorders such as 
schizophrenia, ketamine targets the N-
methyl-D-aspartate 
MDA) glutamate 
receptor, a chemical receptor in the 
brain associated with the coordination 
of different neural networks. Krystal 
explains that all of the treat• nents that 
are approved current!
