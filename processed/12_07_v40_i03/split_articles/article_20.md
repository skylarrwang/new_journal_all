n the summit of Science 
Hill, across the street from 
a row of fading Victorian 
porches and an aged gun 
factory with punctured windows, sits 
a wheelbarrow visibly worn by a loose 
summer spent outdoors. Cradling empty 
beer bottles, it perches near a chalkboard 
covered with Dave Garinger's to-do list: 
''Weed. Divide Iris. Mow down Locust 
Sprouts. Transplant Veggies!!!" 
For the last twenty five years, Garinger 
has lived inside a little clapboard house 
wedged between Mansfield Avenue and 
Hillside Place. As the groundskeeper of 
the Marsh Botanic Gardens, Garinger's 
morning commute consists of puu ing on 
a pair of well-made shoes and stepping 
outside. "Since I live so close," he says, 
"I did a comical video of my commute 
and sent it to my mom. The whole time 
I was saying .things like 'Look, Mom, isn't 
this horrible? I tripped over a rock."' He 
spends the workday weeding the rest of 
the garden, so you'll have to excuse him 
if his own front steps at number 227 are a 
little overgrown. 

The whitewashed cottage forms the 
cornerstone of eight acres of sloping land 
that once belonged to Othniel Marsh, a 
philanthropist whose estate was bestowed 
to the Forestry School in 1899. Some time 
in the last century, a biology professor 
and his wife converted their home on 
the property into an apiary. Scores of 
beehives filled the ground floor. When 
the couple left, the bees were moved out, 
and Garinger moved in. Remnants of its 
former residents remain 
just beyond the 
chainlink fence overgrown with berries 
and jewelweed, visitors are still greeted by 
an ominous sign: "Beware of Bees First 
Floor." 

The work at Marsh Botanic Gardens, 
150 feet from Dave's front steps, involves 
growing plants for genetic research, 
filling orders from a flock of Yale labs, 
and providing a playground for ecology 
classes 
seeking hands-on experience. 
Garinger, the horticulturalist, and Eric 
Larson, the general manager, split the 
daily work. Between the two of them, 
the micro- and macro·- fauna are in good 
hands. Four ~reenhouses, affectionately 
named 1, 2, 3, and 4, split off from 
a 
cracked concrete driveway. 
Here, 
something is · always blooming or being 
dug up. Thankfully, there's still enough 
time for side projects: overgrown pebbles 
are scattered along the path between 
the two largest greenhouses, where Eric 
and Dave are designing a sitting garden 
lined with an overhead trellis for growing

grapes. They are determined to coax the 
grapevine to adulthood. "In the summer 
the leaves will shade us," Eric explains, 
"and in the winter they'll fall down and 
we'll get some nice sunlight." 
In addition to shade, these plants will 
provide a valuable scientific resource. 
Currently, rows of high-tech corn are 
incubating in and around Greenhouse 
4. "We grow the newfangled types 
of mutant corn the professors keep 
breeding," Garinger says. The shrunken 
corn husks, each one a tenth the size of a 
normal ear, are swaddled in white socks to 
prevent cross-pollination. They look like 
midget vegetables to us because they're 
engineered to echo the pre-Neolithic 
' 
ancestors of corn, an eye-opening display 
for the students of agriculture who visit 
the Gardens. -The local wildlife enjoy 
them as well. "The butterflies down at 
the biology lab like to eat corn seedlings," 
Garinger shares, "but now I've got them 
hooked on collard greens." 
Greenhouse 1 is a rebellious museum. 
A 
world-wide 
assortment of ·flora 
intended to educate visiting students fills 
the room. Whole continents are presented 
in miniatpre. Three thousand species of 
plants are clustered by climate, but there's 
no regard for nationality: a Malayan 
Coconut Palm rubs branches with an 
Australian Wollami Pine. The coffee and 
' 
chocolate trees are both sprouting beans 
this year, and the Trovita sweet oranges 
have ripened into their namesake color. 
A portion of each day is set aside for 
detangling the cucumber shoots that like 
to crawl up the windows. "It's a jungle," 
Garinger tells me. "I feel like I'm always 
weeding or clipping." He looks at the 
mossy tree fern and moans, "This thing 
has gotten huge! I need to trim it back." 
Garinger keeps a window display of 
hothouse orchids, but most of them are 
missing their signature blooms. ''They're 
easily kept alive, but it's so hard to get 
them to flower," he mourns. Off in a 
corner, the carnivorous plants keep to 
themselves. Sundews lure in flies with 
their tentacles, while butterwarts stick out 
their dewy topgues. Venus flytraps snap 
their eyes shut at the stroke of a single 
finger. 
But Garinger's heart lies in drier

places. Although he's not too fond of the 
bees his predecessors kept in his home, 
he's keen on another kind of prickly pet: 
his collection of shrunken cacti. · All of 
them live across the road in Greenhouse 
2, part of the educational collection that 
doubles as Garinger's hobby house. His 
favorite cacti- are the living stones of 
Africa, whose flat bumps form a natural 
pavement, and the night-blooming cirrus, 
whose flowers are pollinated by wild bats. 
Somewhere in here is a resident snake 
-
that Garinger rarely sees. Lately it's taken 
to changing its clothes in public: a dried 
shell of a snakeskin lies coiled by a cluster 
of prickly pears. 
"I started this about twenty years ago, 
and some are as old as I've been here," 
Garinger tells me with a smile. He points 
to a noto cactus that could be taken for 
a menacing spiked cucumber. The most 
dangerous cacti have the smallest weapons. 
Glockids, tiny little spines that dig into 
your skin, won't let go after they get a 
After the tour, Larson joins us, and 
the two men show me the three surviving 
bee~ves in Garinger's backyard. These 
bees are the grandchildren of the original 
ones that used to live indoors, and their 
honey is now in demand on the local 
market. Today, they're as busy as could 
be expected. "They love the . goldenrod 
this time of year. They're really working 
it!" he marvels. But then he looks a little 
troubled. "I think they've noticed us," he 
says. "I see them gathering in a clump to 
try and protect the queen. It looks like 
they're getting ready to swarm." 
We hurry back to the gardeners' office, 
and during their afternoon tea break I ask 
Garinger and Larson of their plans for 
the Marsh Botanic Gardens. Using Yale 
funding, they hope to raise the glass roofs 
and turn the low-ceilinged greenhouses 
into a full-blown conservatory, where they 
could plant tropical trees and let them 
grow to their full adult height. ''We need 
a taller structure!" Larson announces.

hold of you. Once, when he was giving a 
tour to a group of second graders, a boy 
got his hands full of them, and Garinger 
could think of no home remedy. ''I told 
the teacher, 'One of your kids has cactus 
spines all over him! I don't know what to 
do,"' he says. "I tell the kids, 'Don't touch 
the cacti,' and they never listen. They go 
around rubbing this and that; they put 
their weight on everything." 
Besides 
the 
four 
greenhouses, 
Garinger also maintains a classroom 
for the Yale ecology classes that come 
in to study plants. Professors choose 
specimens in advance, and Garinger lifts 
each plant from its greenhouse to form 
a rotating exhibit. Today there is a young 
cinnamon tree and a papaya plant, but 
tomorrow they might be replaced by a 
pair of elephant ears and a sago palm. 
"Right now, the coffee and chocolate trees 
can only grow to be dwarfs." Garinger 
nods in agreement. I ask them if they 
think all these wishes will bear fruit, and 
Larson gives me a sagely look. ''It's like 
throwing grass seed out there: some of it 
comes up, and some of it doesn't."
