WHEN CHRIS MICHEL BEGAN WORKING 
at the White House, he spent a lot of 
time listening to President Bush talk. 
He learned the cadence and rhythm of 
his words, the way he chose his phrases, 
the natural structure and logical patterns 
of the President's speech. Michel was 
studying not only what the President said 
5 

but also, even more importantly, how 
he said it. Michel listened to him give 
speeches, interviews, informal talks, and 
any other utterances he could find. 

It was essential preparation. After 
graduating from Yale in 2003 as a history 
major, Michel has spent most of his time 
as a speechwrite.r for the president. He 
has drafted addresses for Bush on topics 
.ranging from Cabinet nominees to the 
Iraq War. The speeches are unified less 
by their content than by their voice-
President Bush's voice, one that Michel 
painstakingly learned and internalized. 

Like 
all 
speechw.rite.rs, 
Michel 
.recognized the need to ~aptu.re someone 
else's style and write the speech his boss, 
o.r the "principal," would have written 
if he had the time. Keith U.rbahn, an 
Secretary of State John Negroponte. 

Despite the power they wield, many 
speechwrite.rs are young. Michel, U.rbahn, 
and Jordan entered the field shortly after 
graduation. In many ways, their youth 
is to their benefit. Speechwriting "is 
something for the young to do," says 
Jordan, because it is in youth that people 
are "able to absorb someone's voice and 
write in a compelling manner for them." 

Perhaps young writers still crafting their 
own identities find it easier to adopt the 
identities of others. 

Yet there is another, more practical 
.reason for . the preponderance of youth 
in speechwriting. In Washington, D.C., 
careers wax and wane with the currents 
of electoral politics, and the young 
travel 
lightly. 
U.rbahn has 
observed 
eloquent speaker himself, describes the 
that there always seem to be new jobs 
process as "synergy." In his experience as 
in speechwriting _ and communications. 
a speechwriter for. the former Secretary 
"People in D.C. who work in those 
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, he noticed 
jobs tend to be young 
tend to be very 
that the best writers disappear behind their 
young 
because there are so many of 
employers. "The ultimate compliment," 
those jobs," he says. 

This same phenomenon means that 
most young speechwrite.rs do not pursue 
it as a lifelong career. As Jordan explains, 
this is just "the nature of political jobs.-
they have a certain shelf life." Once Rice 
.leaves the Department of State, Jordan's 
job is over. She has already begun to think 
ahead, and her future prospects lie outside 
speech writing, perhaps in journalism. 

Michel, too, has begun to contemplate 
the future. Though he .recognizes many 
writers choose to leave because 
"the job is taXing and indeed often leads 
to burnout," his .reasons for leaving are 
different. The hard-earned familiarity 
he gained with Bush left such a strong 
impression that he is not interested in 
writing for anyone else. ''When you spend 
four years writing for one person, as I 
have for President Bush, you form a pretty 
intense bond with the person." There is 
something defiantly loyal in Michel's plans 
to resign from the field. "I'm not sure I'd 
be able to pick up someone else's voice," 
he continues. "And, even if I could, I'm 
not sure I'd want to." 

Though modern politics is propelled 
by clearly defined egos, these egos do not · . belong to speechwriters. The profession 
requires not only that the speechwrite.r 
assume the voice of another, 'but also that 
he relinquish his ownership of the words. 
"This is a · profession that demands its . members to totally .renounce their pride 
of authorship," Michel says. Though 
involved in the creative process of · speech composition, the speechwrite.r is a mere 
conduit for the ideas, and even speech 
patterns, of his employer. "There are a lot 
of great writers who wouldn't be able to 
deal with this forced anonymity," Michel 
adds. "I think that's why speechwrite.rs are 
something of a unique breed.'' 

At the same time, speechwrite.rs wield 
substantial power. Though speeches are 
edited by colleagues, policy-makers, and the 
principals themselves, the .responsibility 
for drafting them is firmly in the hands of 
the speechwrite.r. As Urbahn says, 'cyou 
can't have a policy without being able to 
communicate it. You can't have rhetoric 
without ideas." Speechwriters have not 
only a stake, but also a voice in this legacy. 
They are "part of ·the historic tradition 
of American rhetoric," says Elise Jordan 
'04, who writes speeches for Secretary 
of State Condoleeza Rice and Deputy

**The Freshman File**
**Page number(s): 6**

ros 
MOST YALE STUDENTS KNOW THAT "THE 
file" exists. They imagine a modest rna- · 
nila folder, stuffed with official academic 
documents, nestled safely in their col-
lege dean's filing cabinet. Few students, 
however, know that tucked among their 
neatly-typed admissions application, crisp 
transcripts, and professor recommenda-
tions lies a hand-written paragraph filled 
with reflections on their friends, mental 
health, and life prospects 
up through 
the end of freshman year, anyway. It is 
private, unheralded, and rarely discov-
ered. It is the last concrete legacy of their 
freshman counselor. 

Max Scholz, a J.E. senior, stumbled 
upon his evaluation while working in the 
Yale College Dean's office. Scholz, who 
maintained a prickly relationship with his 
freshman counselor, was written up as a 
"drunkard" who failed to concentrate on 
his studies and broke the Fro-Co suite's 
Christmas tree. Scholz resents the fact 
that his freshman mistakes continue to 
haunt his file, and he questions whether 
it should be the prerogative of freshman 
counselors to 
evaluate 
their 
fellow 
students. 

Ya1ina Disla, a .former Davenport 
Ethnic 
Counselor, 
has 
a 
different 
perspective_ The freshman evaluation, 
she claims, doesn't disclose "top secret 
info" or "juicy gossip." "Confidential 
information is usually not written," she 
says, explaining that the report is not 
. . 
meant to read like a tabloid but rather is 
"simply to give a .recap or background of 
the student something that might have 
changed from their college application."
