she chose to wear the headscarf for the 
first time in her life. In America, unlike in 
Bangladesh, she felt the need to affirm her 
Muslim identity. Zahreen did not follow 
suit. She tucks her glossy hair behind 
her ear as she explains her own choice. 
"Wearing a headscarf would not make me 
more Musllin, but maybe more Muslim, 
physically, to others," she says. "People 
think that if you wear a headscarf you 
are more religious." Zahreen, who prays 
five times a day, fasts, and tries to practice 
Muslim ethics such as being charitable, 
refraining from gossip, and dressing 
modestly, resents this misinterpretation. 
Part of the reason she does not wear 
the headscarf is to challenge others' 
perception of Muslims as a monolithic 
group. She believes in a spectrum of 
Muslim practice, subject to individual 
interpretation. I ask her if feminism and 
the headscarf can be woven together. 
"Part of the fervor around the h!Jab," she 
says, "comes from the conception that it 
is only women who have to wear it, and 
the West is obsessed with how the rest 
of the world treats women. Freedom of 
choice is the ability to make choices, not 
the choices you have."

A

from 
one cousin and 
a 
grandmother who lives in India, 
Zenah is the only woman in her family who 
wears the headscarf. After the September 
11"' attacks, Zenah's cousin began to wear 
it, and Zenah, too, soon became curious 
about the veil. When she read about the 
to various ethoicities and religions. 
Through donning the veil, though, she is 
immediately identified as Muslim. 
Most of her family did not react 
significantly when she began wearing it. 
Her mother was initially encouraging. But 
when Zenah began wearing the headscarf

people to come up to ·me and ask 
me about Islam. '' 
h!Jab in the Qur'an, she interpreted it as a 
call for modesty. ''Wearing the headscarf is 
a process of finding yourself, and finding 
identity," says Zenah, who does not see 
the tradition as a mandatory practice for 
every woman, but believes it is mandatory 
for her. "I wanted to see if it is possible 
to '-\·ear the headscarf in American society 
and be l\luslun. I did not want to become 
a political emblem; I just wanted to see 
if I couJd be visibly American Muslim 
and integrate into society." With her 
green-gray eyes, Zenah couJd be linked

every time she went out, even to dinner 
at a friend's home, her mother tried to 
stop her. For two or three years, Zenah's 
mother was upset that her daughter 
constantly wore the headscarf, but she 
never forced Zenah ro remove it. Now 
she accepts jt as part of Zenah's identity. 
Though Zenah did not want to become a 
political emblem, she has been influential 
in overrurning misconceptions about the 
headscarf within and outside her family. 
She has made it clear, even to her mother, 
that she wears the headscarf by choice. 


While it is a symbol of oppression in 
certain countries, it is quite the opposite 
here. 
first time I discovered that 
Nisreen had worn a headscarf was 
during an interfaith service trip to New 
Orleans. We were sitting in a circle, 
hanging onto Nisreen's captivating and 
articulate narration of her relationship 
with her faith. Nisreen's mother is from 
Malaysia, a secular country where Islam 
is a dominant religion, and Nisreen grew 
' 
up in California. She was the only Muslim 
girl in her school. After the World Trade 
Center fell, many of her peers approached · 
her with stereotypical comments and 
assumptions about Islam. For Nisreen, the 
decision to wear the hijab was a political 
. one. "I wanted to draw attention to the 
. 
fact that I was Muslim," says Nisreen, 
who first donned the headscarf at the age 
ot 14. "I wanted to stand out. I wanted 
people to come up to me and ask me 
about Islam. The hijab was an attention-
grabb~r for me." 
During . the two years she wore the 
headscarf, she found herself being cast 
as · the perfect Muslim girl in both Islamic. 
and non-Islamic communities. Becoming 
a symbol for such a large community· 
was troubling. She also noticed that the 
lieadscarf defined who was a "good" 
or "bad" Muslim; the women who did 
not wear it were treated as outsiders in 
the Muslim community. Nisreen began · 
to question her reasons for wearing the 
headscarf. ''When I wore the hfjab I felt 
that I didn't need to watch what I said. I 
felt I judged too much. Was I wearing it to 
show off that I was a Muslim?" Nisreen 
• ultitilately decided to take it off. "It is 
better to act as an upright person than 
put on a scarf and pretend to be a person 
I'rn not really," she says frankly. Afte.r she

both communities would ask her if she 
was giving up on the faith. One teacher 
even said, "It was really nice to see you 
make a statement. Why did you stop?" 
But her decision to stop wearing the veil 
was a statement in itself one in line with 
the various statements she continues to 
make. 

was worried that I would be attacked 
when I . came here," Nuru confides. 
This was two and a half years ago, when 
she left her home in Botswana to study 
at Yale. Despite her worries, Nuru has 
worn the headscarf throughout her time

· at :Yale. She first donned the headscarf at 
age 13, when her friend's father required 
his daughter to wear the headscarf. 
Nuru, along with several friends, began 
to wear the headscarf in solidarity. ''We 
were her friends, and so we wore it with 
her," she says. The practice wasn't foreign 
to . Nuru 
every woman in her family 
wore the headscarf, and she had always 
expected to don it. In Botswana and New 
Haven, she wears it to identify herself as 
Muslim and to follow her interpretation 
of the religious commandments. She 
believes the headscarf protects women 
from being viewed as objects and 
generates respect based on their character, 
not appearance. Despite the weight it 
carries, the headscarf, she concedes, is

just a headscarf. "It's a tiny part of the 
whole idea of modesty, which includes 
speaking and acting modestly," Nuru says. 
''A lot of people just see the headscarf 
as a symbol of oppression and assume 
various things about me. Friends have not 
told me certain things because· they think 
I would judge them," she says. I thought 
back to my worry of the woman in full 
burqa judging me. I realize the folly of my 
concerns when Nuru continues, "If you 
look at the scripture, you can't judge." 

n the Qur'an, the passage about the 
hijab does not specify which parts of the

body must be covered. The specifics come 
from a H adith, or saying of the Prophet 
Muhammad. Literally interpreted, it says 
that women must cover all but their hands 
and feet; men must cover from navel to 
knee. But both Altaf and Zahreen tell 
me that they read scriptures such as the 
Qur'an with the historical context in 
mind. Languages are alive and change, 
as do interpretations. It is this fluidity 
that surfaces in these women's decisions, 
and which enriches, in turn, their shared 
religion .
