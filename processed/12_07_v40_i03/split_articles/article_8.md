ON ONE WAJ.I . OF CRAIG O'CONNEJJ.'S 
first grade classroom is a huge collage 
in 
garish 
primary 
colors: 
floating 
saxophones played by disembodied paper 
heads, magazine letters reading "JAZZ" 
and "BIRD LIVES," music notes cut 
from construction paper, neon buildings 
plastered on a sharp blue sky. 
Despite 
the frenetic · jumble of color and angles, 
there's an odd harmony to the spastic, 
geometric parts: the buildings tilt toward · 
each other conspiratorially and the notes 
dance in artful clusters. O'Connell stands 
in front of it all, gesturing madly. "ZA-
baza, BOO-zaba, ZEE-zah RO-ni," he 
intones, and a gleeful chorus of six-year-
old voices repeats after him. 

For the past five years, O'Connell has 
been teaching jazz to first graders at St. 
Thomas's Day School on Whitney Avenue. 
It's more than background music; he's 
wrapped his whole curriculum around 
the genre. Geography lessons stem from 
songs that have a flavor 
a pulsing Latin 
beat, a Middle Eastern melody. "I take out 
' 
the map and start talking about it," says 
O'Connell. He plays be-bop so that his 
students learn to distinguish syllables and 
turn sounds into nonsense words. At this 
age, he explains, kids are learning to read, 
and jazz is a great way to teach phonemic 
awareness. "One of the most important 
core ingredients of being a reader is being 
able to hear and discriminate sound," says 
O'Connell. ''Wordplay is an . essential 
ingredient." So when Ella Fitzgerald scats 
in "How High the Moon," the students 
dissect the sounds and write them out on 
a dry erase board. Oo-papa da. Yabba-
4 
bee. Bada-pop. 

O'Connell is a slight figure with a 
thatch of gray curls and an easy, bluesy 
manner. 
Outside of . class, he wears 
a frayed velour zip-up, a t-shirt with 
metallic lettering, and jeans. He sports 
wire-rimmed spectacles and an ample 
moustache. His gravelly voice is slow and 
rhythmic. O'Connell is .on a first-name 
basis with all the jazz greats: Miles, Ella, 
Dizzy. When he speaks about jazz, he 
leans forward across the table and drags 
. 
' . 
out his words: · "Charlie Parker was. a. 
seminal. force."· He enunciates carefully. 
"And 
little 
kids 
six-year-olds 
are 
digging him. They walk into a store when 
music is playing and say 'That's Miles 
Davis, that's John Coltrane.' They're 
blowing the parents away." 

O'Connell has been teaching for 36 
years, but he's not entirely sure how he 
ended up in the field. In college, he was 
a sociology major and philosophy minor. 
'~t the time I had to make a decision. The 
Vietnam war 'was raging, for one thing, and 
that was not my first choice," he explains. 
''I had to make a living, I like kids. It all 
added up." For a while, O'Connell played 
jazz in the classroom, but that was about . 
it. "Kinda like the Miles Davis tunes you 
. might hear on the Weather Channel," he 
says with a lopsided grin. 

, His idea began to germinate when 
his students were gathered on the floor 
during their daily afternoon meeting. A girl 
raised her hand and said, "I have a dog." 
O'Connell was initially uninterested, all 
too aware of the dangers of meandering 
six-year olds and their attention spans. 
"I don'.t particularly want to hear dog 
stories at the end of the day because 
everyone has a dog and everyone wants 
to tell their stories," he explains. But the 
little gid continued, "His name is Miles." 
O'Connell's interest was piqued. When 
the girl informed him that the dog also 
had a middle name 
Davis 
O'Connell 
decided to test the waters. "Do you see 
that poster right behind me?" he told the 
students. "That's a man whose name is 
Miles Davis. Did you ever hear of him?" 
For the most part, they hadn't. But when 
O'Connell put on a Charlie Parker tune 
called "Now is the Time," the kids jumped 
up and started dancing. 

So he sat down, wrote a curriculum 
• • 
comprised of ten lesson plans, and sent 
it off to the National Music Foundation. 
"I figured that when I submitted this/' 
he says, "that they would think I was 
either out of my mind, or that what I was 
doing was actually pretty profound." He 
won first place in the American Music 
Education Initiative, and was awarded 
a thousand dollar grant to jumpstart 
his jazz program. Now, the impact of 
the project has rippled throughout the 
school. There's a jazz club for parents, 
and O'Connell recently took 7 5 parents 
and kids on a field trip to a club called 
"The Jazz Standard" in New York City. 

These first graders 
some of whom are 
still on the cusp of literacy 
are learning 
how to identify musicians and styles of 
music, and loving it. "The kids are asking 
for Dizzy Gillespie CDs in their Christmas 
stockings," O'Connell says proudly. 

Today, his lesson is based on a book 
called "The Jazz Fly," which comes with 
a supplementary CD. The students are 
sitting on the floor, cross-legged and 
bouncing. A boy with a cowlick plays the 
air sa~ophone. Theodore, . a wide-eyed 
seven-year old with a shock of unruly 
hair, declares that he loves jazz "because 
you get to move to it a little bit." Connor's 
favorite 
musician is John Coltrane, 
although "that's a hard question." Priscilla 
likes music and all things art-related. "I like 
to make creations," she says solemnly. 

O'Connell gives . all the students 
whiteboards and tells them, '~fter you 
write out what you hear, let's change every 
b to a p and see what happens!" This was 
a crucial mistake. "ZA-baza, BOO-zaba" 
becomes "ZA -paz a, POO-zapa," and the 
word "POO" is too much for the kids to 
handle. The room dissolves into giggles. 
But O'Connell continues to conduct the 
chant with magisterial ease, mouthing 
the syllables and nodding his head to the 
rhythm of the song. 

All around him, the walls are lined 
with posters: Sonny Rollins is too cool in 
an icy shade of blue, with the collar of his 
white shirt flopped lackadaisically to the 
side. Theolonius Monk, photographed in 
milky yellow tones, stares upwards. He. has 
a goatee, dark glasses, and a tipped-back 
hat. Dizzy. Gillespie wears a beret and 
wide-rimmed glasses. His eyelids are low 
and sluggish and his mouth is curled as
