Truth and Reconciliation 
The Artemis Project archives individual stories of national violence. 

I
n 2004, months before she was pan-
lyzed in a car accident in Sierra Leone, 
Artemis Christodulou '()() realized 
that everything she'd worked to collect 
over the past twO years could disappear. 
All 83 pages of inmates' essays from a 
Sierra Leonean prison, where many died 
without ever ;having been convicted; all 
13 faces on a painting bearing a Sierra 
Leonean flag, loolcing to a future of good 
roads and streetlights; all of the stamps, 
poems, plays, and sculptures from com-
batants and civilians that bad borne wit-
ness to the transition of a nation. 

In a conversation with Yale English 
32 
By Pria Anand 
and Comparative Literature Professor 
Geoffrey Hartman, Christodulou dis-
cussed her work with Sierra Leone's Truth 
and Reconciliation Committee. She was 
about to take a semester off from gradu-
ate school to run the TRC's National Vi-
sion Project, an attempt to document the 
aspirations of Sierra Leone's citizens for 
the future of their country, devastated by 
eleven years of civil war. The tWO won-
dered whether any archive of testimonies 
from truth commissions across the world 
existed. She ascertained that none did. 

As she was about to leave for Sierra 
Leone for the last rime, Ch.ristodulou laid 
the groundwork for establishing such an 
archive at Yale, contacting transitional jus-
rice experts and law school faculty. These 
efforts, and Christodulou's respect for the 
individual stories of national tragedy, are 
at the roor,.of Yale's campaign to memo-
rialize the global devastation of genocide, 
civil war, and internal oppression. Arte-
mis Christodulou would not return to 
Yale, but her name, like these stories, is 
immortalized in the Artemis Project. 

E
telle Higonnet '00 LAW 'OS and 
Alexi Zervos '99 LAW '05, twO of 
the Project's founding members, believe 
THE NEW JOURNAL 

that the Project began in spirit, at least, in 
2003, when they traveled to Sierra Leone 
with Christodulou to work on issues of 
transitional justice. Although Christodu-
lou had already done similar work for 
the International Center for Transitional 
. 
' 
Justice as well as for truth commissions 
in South America and Indonesia, this first 
trip to Sierra Leone cemented her com-· 
mitment to truth commissions and drew 
her back just one year later. 

The accident happened in May 2004, 
while Christodulou was heading the Na-
tional Vision Project in Sierra Leone with 
Zervos's sister, Anthea. The two were 
driving from Makeni to a potential exhibi-
tion site in Freetown for the project, anq 
they were soon evacuated to. a hospital in . 
Paris. While Anthea Zervos recovered, 
Christodulou remained in a coma, and 
when she awoke,. she had suffered seri-
ous brain damage. It was about a month . 
after the accident, remembers Higonnet, 
that her friends realized that Christodulou 
might not be able to make a full recovery, 
and Alexi Zervos, Higonnet, and Daniel 
Feldman GRD '08 began to . talk about 
creating an initiative at Yale to honor 
Christodulou and her work. When Pro-
fessor Hartinan told the students about 
his and Christodulou's conversation about 
a universal archive, they found a focus for 
their project. 

Since its official launch at a meeting 
of Yale librarians, faculty, and Christodu-
lou's former colleagues in June 2005, the 
Artemis Project· has sought to create a 
central archive for mat~rials collected by 
the world's 25 truth conimissions, orga-
nizations that pursue reconciliation after 
periods of internal conflict. It .aims to 
publicly preserve both victims' and per-
petrators' stories as a record of a history 
that might otherwise be too easily forgot-
ten. 

Because they document violent politi-
cal transitions, the materials the Artemis 
Project seeks to archive are often at risk. 
"Sometimes, it's as simple as someone 
setting a match to some boxes, and hun-
dreds of testimonials are destroyed," ex-
plains Julie Carney '08, the Project's cur-
rent student director. "One of the central 
ironies is that these stories are told so 
-
that they can be on the historical record, 
and instead, they often end up in a base-
ment somewhere." While the National 
Vision Project was exhibited internation-

ally, many TRC materials are now collect-
ing dust in university sto~age rooms, and 
scores of other truth commission docu-
ments, which are never removed from 
their nations of origin, have met an even 
less certain fate. The Artemis Project 
seeks to prevent such losses by providing 
an online repository that will persist long 
after truth commissions consider their 
work complete · one that is accessible to 
everyone, from victims to human rights 
professionals. 

"These documents should be available 
to the world; they are about crimes against 
humanity, not against Sierra Leoneans or 
black South Africans," says Higonnet,. 
"Everyone should know and everyone 
.should care about it." 

The challenge the Artemis Project 
now faces is how to ensure that these 
documents, which capture SOf!le of the 
most significant moments in global his-
tory, can remain permanendy . available 
without compromising the confideritia4ty 
of the individuals whose testimo~als ~ey · 
exhibit. "'~hese people have put their lives 
on die line, have risked eve 
· g, to tell 
the truth about the past," says Higonnet. 
"The Artemis Project is about honoring 
truth commissions, and about honoring 
the people who testified, which is what 
Artemis wanted." 

Those invested in the Project also be-
lieve that it is also inexorably linked to the 
Yale community. ''This is something that 
makes sense to do as a student, and as a 
student at Yale," says Jessica Heyman '07, 
a former student director. She aut ibutes 
the importance of operating the Project 
through Yale to the resources of the Yale 
University Library and to the potential 
power of a Yale community made aware 
of wartime atrocities. The Project now 
functions in two capacities: a Yale out-
reach branch that Heyman describes as 
"the Artemis Project student initiative" 
and the Artemis Project archive itself. So 
far, the organization has focused most of 
its work on the former. During the 2005-
2006 s~hool year, the Project hosted two 
international conferences, one with truth 
commission managers and archivists and 
the second with journalists from nations 
undergoing political transition. In spring 
2006, the Project received a grant to host 
a speaker series with truth commission 
scholars and organized an undergraduate 
political science seminar on truth com-
tn1SS10ns. 

The archive itself is still in the process 
of materializing; its structure will be final-
ized this December. "It has been a very 
slow process," Carney explains. The Ar-
temis Project's student participants have 
met with members of the Human Rights 
Project to discuss the Project's archival 
practicalities 
how materials should be 
digitized, how they should be solicited. 
This fall, the Artemis Project used grant 
funding to hire a consulting archivist 
from the Yale University Library, who 
conducted a research trip to Peru and Si-
erra Leone in November. The informa-
tion she gathered about truth commission 
documents in these countries will soon 
be synthesized into a report that will be 
shared with the Artemis Project commit-
ononn 
tee, as well as with archivists working on 
similar projects at other institutions. "Ex-
aminations of the kinds of records that 
were generated by both commissions, and 
how they have been preserved and 111ade 
available since the work of the commis-
sion was completed, will provide us the 
information we need to deliver them digi-
tally to the research community," explains 
Christine Weideman, the deputy director 
of Manuscripts and Archives at the Yale 
University Library.
