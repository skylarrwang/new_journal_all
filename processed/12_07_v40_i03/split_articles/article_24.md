he more widespread complaint among undergraduates is 
how few music faculty are available to offer them private 
lessons. An undergraduate voice student, who asked to remain 
anonymous for fear of harming her relationship with several 
campus ensembles, was surprised to learn upon her arrival at 
Yale that there simply were not enough faculty members to 
teach her. ''When I came to Yale; I was under the impression 
that I would study with someone on the faculty. That's kind of 
wha.t they told me," she said. 

Private lessons for undergraduates are run by .the .School 
of Music in cooperation with the Departtnent of Music. Yale 
has only hired faculty to teach · highly skilled undergraduate 
pianists, violinists, and cellists; each year, professors may 
choose to take on a handful of exceptionally talented students 
of other instruments, but the numbers are always small. These 
lessons are apportioned on the basis of auditions and offered 
for course credit; students who fail to get a professor may pay 
graduate students for not-for-credit lessons. 

Though this voice studentis among the few undergraduates 
in the Schola Cantorum, a well-paid, highly selective, 
predominantly graduate voice ensemble, she was assigned 
a graduate student and was dissatisfied with the result. 
"Sometimes you have a teacher who isn't very interested 
in teaching," she said. "I had a teacher last year who was 
notorious for that." While graduate students at the School of 
Music, especially in the wake of the donation, are among the 
best young musicians in the world, they are often unqualified 
to instruct top-level undergraduates, some of whom will 
attend conservatories themselves after graduation. Of the 
approximately ninety voice students who apply for lessons 
each term, only about 15 may expect to receive lessons with 
faculty members. In other instruments, particularly woodwinds 
and brass, the number is closer to zero. 

Sophomore Daniel Schlosberg, a top-level composition 
student and pianist who studies with Wei-Yi Yang, a School of 
Music faculty member, has noticed similar flaws in the lessons 
program. "There inay be some grad students who are good, 
but it depends, and they cycle through so quickly," he said. ''I 
believe they should provide professors for undergraduates." 

The composition program, in which Schlosberg said available 
courses are minimal and private lessons extremely rare, is 
similarly limited for undergrads, as is the conducting program, 
which, according to Swisher, has only two faculty conductors 
despite the fact that "there's so many of us who want to 
d 
con uct. 
·u .... School of Music is the reason that many of these 
undergraduates come . to Yale in the first place. "Can 
you imagine," Margot Fassler asks, "what the musical culture 
would be without the School of Music?" Indeed, the spillover 
effects undergraduates enjoy by studying beside the School 
of Music are numerous: the School of Music holds four to 
five concerts on any given week; its graduate students fill the 
ranks of the Ya!_e Symphony Orchestra, Concert Band, and 
Glee Club, as well as countless other smaller ensembles like 
the Schola Cantorum, the Camerata, chamber groups, and 
shared graduate-undergraduate music classes. The School of 
Music is not only responsible for most of the lessons that

undergraduate music students receive 
and even the most inept 
students receive the very best graduate students as teachers 
but 
also for the use of top-notch practice spaces. When the School 
renovates Hendrie Hall, Concert Band musicians will no longer 
need to lug their instruments up six flights of stairs because the 
building will finally have an elevator. 

These benefits, however, are no more than spillover, focused on 
the School of Music and largely peripheral to the needs of Yale's 
undergraduate musicians. Those priorities are clear enough. ''We 
teach all applied music for undergraduates," Blocker said. "The 
School of Music has an integral responsibility and committnent to 
this." The School of Music undertook this responsibility and now, 
finally enjoying the use of its unprecedented resources, has let its 
contribution to undergraduates remain static in order to direct its 
resources outward, fighting for global attention and attracting an 
ever-finer crop of international graduate students. The University 
itself, which demonstrated its substantial commitment to music by 
supporting the School of Music's growth, has remained notably 
frugal in its support of undergraduate ensembles. Some of the 
very best young adult performers in the country already study 
here; why should their education be any less than exemplary? 

The contrast between the institution's commitment and the 
resources it offers is stark, and no one wants it this way. Levin 
has suggested that the University will increase the number of 
students taught by music faculty. For his part, Blocker sings the 
right tune: ''I believe firmly that those of us who are privileged by 
the opportnnities provided for us have an obligation to provide 
opportunity for other people," he said. "What a great joy and 
opportunity it is to have, in the hands of a young adult, music, 
which is able to bridge cultures like nothing else." Undergraduates 
will believe him once they see a bridge or two of their own.
