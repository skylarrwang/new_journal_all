BOOTYLICIOUS BURN STARTS IN HALF AN 
hour, and the studio looks ready to go. 
Barely-clothed, shining bodies parade 
across stacks of fitness magazines. A 
rainbow of rubber balls and handweights 
brightens one corner of the room. The 
lights cut through the strip mall parking 
lot, ca11ing through the dark · October 
night: New Haven women, it's time to 
work those glutes. But the door is locked. 
"Back in 10 minutes," says the sign. 

Inside, Mubarakah Ibrahim, Certified 
Personal Trainer, is praying. 

Ibrahim is the founder of Balance 
Fitness, a women's fitness studio on 
Whalley Avenue. She's also an orthodox 
Sunni Muslim. Without an inch of 
muscled skin exposed, Ibrahim is not 
who you'd expect to find here, at a studio 
celebrated by locals as a center of female 
empowerment. She covers all but her face 
and hands around non-related males. Her 
headscarf, or hijab ( literally "to cover" in 
Arabic) represents modesty and morality. 

Ibrahim may be modest, but she's not 
meek. The hijab, she says, is "the epitome 
of empowerment... it forces people to 
look at you for who you are." She flashes 
a big, white-toothed smile. "I tend to have 
to prove myself a lot more often than 
other people do,_but I really don't have a 
problem with that." 

She's not camera-shy, either. Her 
grinning face graces newspapers, TV 
December 2007 
stations, and blogs across · the country. 
"The press loves me," she boasts. Half 
Cherokee and half African-American, 
she presents herself as the quintessential 
American. Ibrahim designs her own 
workout outfits with an eye for fashion.-
her trademark is · a long-sleeved ·pink 
camouflage 
shirt~ pink headscarf, and 
pink-and-white Nikes 
and plans to 
launch her own clothing line next spring. 

This year, she toured New England to 
promote her book, Fat Loss 10: The 10 
Commandments rif Fat Loss. Despite all this 
publicity, one bit of press tops all others. 

For Ibrahim, life is divided into before 
and after "the show." Oprah's show. 
"The show'' made Ibrahim America's 
champion of fitness for Muslim women. 
"Muslim women 
don't 
have 
bikini 
season," Ibrahim says. ''You can literally 
go 24 hours without thinking about the 
rolls on your stomach. It isn't until you 
get in the shower that you say, 'Oh look, 
I have a roll!"' Unbothered by their flab 
and uncomfortable in mixed-gender 
gyms, Muslim women, Ibrahim says, 
tend to steer clear of fitness regimes. 

But according to Ibrahim, they are taking 
a growing interest in physical fitness. 
Through her non-profit, Fit Muslimah, 
Ibrahim organized a Muslim women's 
fitness conference in July that drew 
almost three hundred women and girls to 
New Haven. Ibrahim's name has traveled 
as far as Turkey, where a fitness clothing 
company sent her a Muslim running outfit. 
"I'm like the Muslim Denise Austin!" she 
laughs, referring to the blonde, often 
scantily-dad fitness video star. 

At the same time, Ibrahim has 
no qualms about helping non-Muslim 
women look good in their bikinis. ''I try 
not to judge why people want to be in 
good shape.," she says. ''I justgive you the 
fitness. What you do with it is up to you." 

The women who show up for Fat Loss 101 
and Bootylicious Burn range from middle-
aged bottle blondes to Hasidic Jews. ''It's 
all shapes, sizes, cultures, ethnicities," 
woman says. ''It's an environment that 
crosses all those barriers." While there 
is no dress code at the studio, Balance 
devotees have adopted their own veil of 
sorts: the white curtains that sometimes 
cover the all-glass storefront. Orig1na11y 
used only for Muslim clients, who 
uncover inside the studio, the curtains are 
increasingly popular with non-Mus1irns. 
"I'm finding that more and more women 
actually want me to put the curtains up. 
They say, 'I don't want anybody to see me 
work out!"' According to one, they are 
happy to escape the "meat market" of co-
ed gyms. "There's no pick up-factor," says 
a tall woman layered with silver jewelry. 

But even if you can run from men, 
you can't escape the eyes of Ibrahim-
especially when you're 
showing up 
for Bootylicious Burn. As the hour 
approaches, Ibrahim unlocks the door, 
draws the curtains, · and changes into 
slightly shorter sleeves. She winds the ends 
of her lavender scarf around her head 
and tucks them in, making a turban; her 
fingers move with the confident grace of 
habit. A woman in hfjab walks in, heads to 
the bathroom to change, and reemerges, 
bare-headed, in a Fit Muslimah t-shirt. 
"That's my signature statement." Ibrahim 
points to the shirt. "Fitness is not a look. 
It's a state of being. Looking good is just 
a side effect." In the middle of the shirt, 
a cartoon woman in a headscarf lifts a 
weight, demonstrating Commandment X 
of Fat Loss 10: "Thou shall lift steel." 

On the aerobics floor, a full wall 
of mirrors confronts each client with 
her own image and lets Ibrahim keep 
an eye out for slackers. Her soft, girlish 
voice occasionally sharpens to a trainer's 
bark, rising above the beat of techno-mix 
Beyonce, pushing the panting women to 
tighten their abs and deepen their squats. 
"Oh, I'm feeling the burn," Ibrahim 
calls out. "It's the Bootylicious Burn!"
