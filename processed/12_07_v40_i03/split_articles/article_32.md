burning through U!Jsses on a
second floor balcony beneath
the looming fac;ade of Notre
Dame, I was interrupted by a pianist
hammering out rhythmic jazz in harmony
with a frenzied drumbeat from below.
Following the staircase down to the piano,
•
I encountered Carnal, the bookshop's
carpenter. His toolbox lay locked at his
side; instead of repairing the two poetry
shelves that had collapsed the day before,
he sat on the corner stair beating a make-
shift drum in time to the pouring summer
rain. Instead of facing the indignity of
walking drenched through Saint-Michel,
Carnal was waiting out the rain inside the
shop. I sat down on the top stair and,
following Carnal's lead, enclosed within
its doors, decided to surrender myself to
the peculiar melody of Shakespeare and
Co.

Some weeks before, on my arrival
at the Parisian bookshop, I had pushed
through the swarms of awed customers
and asked for Sylvia, Sylvia Beach
Whitman. I would begin my stay in her
bookshop that evening. A thin-framed
woman stood behind the vintage cash
register, surrounded by the summer horde
of American tourists, all of whom were
overwhelmingly relieved to speak English
with the Australian-accented manager. Eli
that I am, I expected Sylvia to descend
from her manager's office and offer a full
orientation on the rules and regulations
of the shop. As I would be sleeping there,
I assumed that a few expectations would
be established. Yet I quickly realized that
control and organization were antithetical
to the bohemian lifestyle of Shakespeare
and Co. I was to read, and I was to write.
In exchange for this intellectual discovery
was a mattress, located right in the center
of Paris. According to my official tide, I
was a ''Writer-in-Residence."

Sleeping overnight in a bookstore
encapsulated all of my fondness for folios
and octavos, even for the paperback. Yet
not any bookstore would satisfy me
I
had to sleep overnight in Shakespeare and
Company.

Though Shakespeare and Co. attracts
some tourists because of its consistent
listing in Paris guidebooks, most overlook
this hidden treasure tucked between the
busding markets of Saint-Michel and the
flying buttresses of Notre-Dame. This
small bibliophilic sanctuary is known for
December 2007
its eclectic collection of English novels in
a country which vigorously promotes all
things French. It also serves as a haven
for wandering and penniless writers who
are allowed to sleep ainong its shelves for
. '
free.

When I first heard of the opportunity,
I was skeptical. Perhaps it was possible for
a beatnik, but not for me, not now. Even
.
the most unconventional modern hipster,
I thought, would not hitchhike across
Europ'e without a mapped.,.out plan or
sleep in a grimy and soiled bookshop just
for the sake of advenwre. Yet according
to the store's owner, George Whitman,
over forty-thousand people have sl~pt in
e
all congregated in her shop, which
became the center of literary culture and
innovative ideas. Hardly by coincidence,
all of the books banned in England and
America
most notably, Joyce's U!Jsses'--
were .readilty .available in Sylvia's shop.
After Anglophone publishers rejected the
monumental text as pornographic, Beach
. decided to publish it out of Shakespeare
and Company.

The shop closed after the
German occupation of Paris during
World War II.
Hemingway himself
liberated the store when he entered Paris
with the American troops in 1944, but
it was years before it re-opened across

his shop over the years. I went to Paris
determined to become the next.

One cannot know Shakespeare and
Co. without knowing George._ A 93-year-
old man who retains a remarkably lucid
memory and a propensity to burst into a
tyrannical rage, George is a living legend
whose presence in the shop inspires both
awe and fear. He occasionally descends
from his apartment on the third floor
a
space he calls "The Museum of the Lost
Generation"
and sits out on the wooden ·
benches lining the fac;ade of the shop,
picking up three or four of the rejected
used books, insisting that all of them
have something worthwhile to offer:. A
staunch socialist and a consummate host
who lives by the adage, Be not inhospitable to
strangers, lest thry be angels in disguise, he first
allowed complete strangers to sleep in his
bookstore in 1951.

George is the second owner of
Shakespeare and Company; Sylvia Beach
Whitman, his daughter, now manages the
shop. The original bookstore, located in
the heart of l'Odeon, was established by
Sylvia Beach in 1919. Her lending libraty
of English books quickly became the
refuge for all of the expatt iate writers
of the Lost Generation. Hemingway,
Fitzgerald, Pound, Stein, Joyce

town. George felt he had the prerogative
to reestablish the store, recreating a
literary haven where young writers could
gather, discuss, and create, while living
in one of the world's most stimulating
cities. A second generation of lost writers
gathered in George's bookshop, everyone
from the last modernists
Henry Miller,
Anais Nin, Richard Wright, and Samuel
Beckett
through
the
first
Beats-
Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and
Lawrence Ferlinghetti. George restored
Beach's literary sphere, but this rime

you can; take what you need.

entered George's utopia and fell into
the rhythms of the shop's exceptional
lifestyle. On my first day of residence,
I passed underneath the green front
doorway and was confronted with a chaos
of books, lying strewn in every possible
direction. Books extended up to the edge
of the rolling ceiling and crowded into
splintered wooden shelves so unstable
that one could not pull a spine off the
shelf without fear of collapse. Pyramidal
piles of books were stacked in corners,
stuffed into suitcases like dirty clothing,
or thrown, rolling and dismembered,
into bins outside the shop, as if some

one. Interspersed throughout this mayhem
were
seven
mattresses,
comfortably
awaiting the fatigued residents of the
shop once those green doors closed at
midnight.

·
During my stay, the shop hosted
anywhere from three to ten writers each
night. We obediently helped open the
shop at midday and close at midnight.
For two hours in between, we worked in
the store . a sort of work-study program
as part ·of our invitation to stay. One
afternoon, while I was shelving literary
nonfiction, a delicate model entered the
bookshop, picked up the nearest Tiffany-
blue hardback an9 pretended to read
pose for her shoot. I felt eerily analogous
to Audrey Hepburn in Funf!Y Face} covered
in the grime of dusty book jackets,
scripted to the role of the bookworm in
opposition to the liberated and vivacious
Fred Astaire.

?ach morning, the resident writers
wearily strolled across the street to Cafe
Panis, where the waiters behind the bar
distinguished us · from the Notre Dame
tourists . by our bloodshot eyes, our dirty
clothes, and (above all) our greasy hair. We
quickly gulped down the one euro cafe at
the bat: cheap but strong. After that, we
went our separate ways
heading upstairs
to the library to .fulfill George's bidding
that we read a book a day or sitting down at
an anCient typewnter, attempting to wnte
amidst all the customers disturbing our
temporary home. We would reconvene at
midnight and retreat upstairs to the library,
pop open the cheapest bottle of wine that
Franprix offered, and let our thoughts
flow. We positioned ourselves amidst the
books and talked into the wee hours of the
morning. Some nights, the conversations
were more intellectual--discussing the
absurdity of French deconstructionism,
Ted Hughes' influence on Sylvia Plath,
or the ways Walter Benjamin's theories on
art applied to Paris' constantly-clicking
tourists. Other times, we simply laughed
uncontrollably at YouTube videos or
mentally prepared ourselves for our en-
masse excursion the next morning to the
free public showers.

George was a prominent fixture during
my stay. I recall fondly the morning when
I was allowed to "shower" in George's
bathtub, pouring a pan of hot water
over myself, terrified of the ubiquitous
cockroaches squirming throughout his
apartment, or of seeing George himself, a
notable ladies' man, spying on me through
the stained gl~s windows that lined the
tub. I gained the. ultimate satisfaction one
Sunday afternoon when I was privileged
to be George's "Tea Lady." I served tea
to his friends, his dedicated followers, and
even the random customers who gathered
in his tiny apartment every Sunday at four
o'clock. His crass voice rang into the
narrow hallway, inquiring as to whether
everyone had a cup of tea and a madeleine.

Moments later, he strode into the room,
still dressed in his blue polka-dot pajamas
with his wired grey hair pointing in every
direction.

eyond feeling compelled to live
in Shakespeare and Co., I wanted
to read U fysses in the books hop that
published it. I managed to hew my way
through Joyce's jumbled narrative, sitting
on the seco.Q.d-floor windowsill, looking
across the -Seine to Notre Dame. Yet
reading the monumental epic didn't have
the profound effect I had anticipated.
The bookstore changed me more than
its colossal publication. It fulfilled my
deep-rooted desire' to be bohemian; to
throw away my planner and Post-It notes
and merely live by the hour; to no longer
be the collared-shirted, trousered, tight-
bunned Yale student. To be part of the
generation still lost, migrating from place
to place without any fixed destination; to
no longer have a mapped out plan, but
.r
;
'
. -~ ····· .. '
•'.. .
merely exist from day to day, having no
connections, no way to be traced, but to
just be.

I was still living in the bookstore
during the crazed celebrations of the
final Harry Potter installment. In the midst
of the long line of squealing customers
eager to acquire their reserved copies,
George yelled at me for not properly
centering Shakespeare and Co.'s signature
stamp on the title page, insisting that
the customer deserved a refund for
not receiving a properly-placed stamp.
I laughed, and Sylvia smiled at me with
sympathy. After the copies had been sold,
George sat down in a corner chair to
offer all the regulars his homemade butter
rum from a glass bell jar. We all walked
outside and dispersed across -the worn
benches lining the shop. I carefully rolled
some tobacco; as I peered over the end
of my first cigarette, I saw the eager eyes
and smirlciog smile of a fellow writer as
he lit the end. He seemed to take infinite
pleasure in his minor involvement in my
conversion into a free-spirit. I smiled and
inhaled. I breathed in, opening my lungs
and myself to a bohemian rhythm.
