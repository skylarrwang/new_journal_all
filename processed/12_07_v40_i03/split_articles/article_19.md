that were cheaper than what I'm selling," 
says Hartman. "It was like going into the 
lion's den." 

After some financial difficulties and 
personal crises, Hartman defaulted on 
his loan. His team members paid it back 
through combined fundraising · efforts, 
but Hartman is no longer involved with 
Elmseed. Currently working in customer . 
service, Harttnan misses the freedom of 
being self-employed, but he doesn't miss 
the challenges of running a small busi-
ness. "Most people say it's like baby steps, 
but I noticed being a small business you 
get stepped on easily." 

Dean Karlan, an assistant professor 
of economics at Yale who specializes 
in microcredit, believes that stories like 
these 
more than the challenges of inter-
est rates and operating costs 
explain the 
mixed record of microcredit in America. 
"One of the biggest challenges domestic 
microcredit faces is that most small enter-
prises in America fail," says Karlan. "In 
developing countries there's a flourish-
ing sector that is huge, but you don't see 
much of that in America. It's less obvious 
the types of things that an unemployed 
person with a five hundred dollar loan 
can do." Because of this difficult market, 
successfully starting a business requires 
unique initiative, something that few pos-
sess. 

Clayton Williams, a senior loan officer 
with New Haven's Small Business Initia-
tive, which provides small entrepreneurs 
with business training and slightly larger 
loans than Elmseed's, tries to make sure 
that his clients are prepared to run a small 
business. "I always ask new clients, 'Are 
you the kind of person who doesn't mind 
working 18-20 hours a day? Or do you 
need eight to ten hours of sleep and want 
to take a vacation every year?' If you're the 
former then maybe you can start a busi-
ness, and if you're the latter you should 
probably get a job," says Williams. 

lmseed's founders were disillusioned 
-
by the difficulties of creating suc-
cessful businesses from scratch. '1: think 
in the beginning we imagined that we'd 
just put up signs saying 'Microloans' 
and people would come," says Kuris. In-
stead, recruiting was difficult; most of the 
group's initial clients were brought in with 
Washington's help, and t nany of the origi-
nal loan recipients were unprepared to 
start a business. A jazz musician defaulted 
on the money he had borrowed to cut his 
demo tape. A woman who had hoped to 
start a promising business selling supplies 
for the deaf lacked the contacts to form a 
group and, as no pre-existing groups had 
space, was unable even to join the pro-
gram. ''A lot of people took their kind-
ness for weakness," Washington says of 
the Elmseed staf£ "Because they're young 
and from Yale, people think you've got a 
lot of money." 

It was a short but difficult time, Kuris 
believes, before the staff began to under-
stand the complexity of poverty. ''After 
the first year we were really humbled, 
both by the initiative of our staff, and the 
difficulties of the issue at hand," he says. 
"It was a steep learning curve." 

Jeremy Kahan '04, a former CEO of 
Elmseed who currently sits on its board, 
reiterates the delicate balance between 
business and philanthropy. "You're lend-
ing to people who have a very fragile eco-
nomic situation," says Kahan. "These are 
real-life people with real-life situations. 
You know what, it's really hard to collect 
your $1,500 when someone doesn't have 
enough money to pay for their dialysis." 

Despite these issues, the repayt 11ent rate 
that first year was over 90 percent and is 
now an impressive 94 percent. 

Though this statistic sounds promis-
ing, it doesn't necessarily indicate Elm-
seed's success in geu ing small businesses 
off the ground with micro-loans. Victor 
Wong '09, CPO of Elm seed, declined to 
provide the number of successful busi-
nesses created through Elmseed fund-
ing. Alumni estimate ten businesses have 
prospered. Lau believes that Elmseed's 
success should be measured in its repay-
ment rates, its business successes, and its 
personal successes. "One of our clients 
is a clo~n, and he employs half a dozen 
people," says Lau. "It's making change on 
a small scale, and seeing it spread." 

But for some clients, this scale is too 
small. Despite the twenty-thousand dol-
lars of loans Elmseed is currently circu-
lating amongst its clients, Verab has yet 
to take out a threshold loan of $1,500. 
"I look at Elmseed as brainstorming," 
Verab explains. "Maybe 1 percent of all 
businesses can do something with a loan 
of $1,500. For my business, for an estab-
lished business, that kind of money is 
nothing. Yeah, you can buy a hot dog cart, 
but to rent a facility, to buy equipment, it's 
just not going to work." 

As a student organization, however, 
Elmseed's success should be measured 
not only in terms of its clients, but in 
terms of its staff. After ditching problem 
sets for center meetings and summer par-
ties for four a.m. phone calls with clients, 
the students who work for Elmseed come 
to identify with the singular devotion and 
sacrifice necessary to operate a small busi-
ness. Kahan is fully aware of Elmseed's 
role in shaping students' futures. ''We've 
created several independent businesses, 
and besides that we're getting ten kids 
who are doing something very concrete, 
meaningful, and important," he explains. 
"People who graduate from Elmseed go 
on to become great civil leaders." 

Choy emphasizes that the concept of 
microcredit is still in a trial phase. "The 
jury is still out on microcredit in general," 
he says. "Even Grameen, which has been 
around for thirty years now 
there are 
still lots of debates about whether that's 
a good idea now." 

Elmseed's staff members remain con-
vinced. ''Elmseed doesn't rna ke claims to 
change the world," says Wu. ''We're not 
going to change New Haven in a year. But 
I know Elmseed has made a difference in 
individual's lives."
