Researchers hope that experiments like

often associated with its countercultural 
proponents than 
its 
medical 
ones. 
Psychedelic gurus like astrologer Marcia 
Moore, who advocated the recreational 
use of ketam.ine in her 1978 book,Journrys 
into the Bright World, and D.M. Turner, 
author of The Essential P.rychedelic Guide, 
remain powerful images of the pitfalls 
of ketamine and· its place in American 
drug culture. Moore disappeared from . 
her house in 1979, presumably under 
the influence of ketamine. Her skeleton 
was discovered two years later in a tree, 
where she had frozen to death. On New 
Year's Eve of 1996, Turner drowned in 
his bathtub tripping on ketamine.

Ketamine is currendy listed as a 
Schedule III narcotic by the United States 
Drug Enforcement Agency, along with . 
anabolic steroids and GHB, "the date rape 
drug." Known on the street as "Special 
K," ketamine has become popular on the 
rave scene in recent years. "It is an entirely 
different, and a potentially dangerous 
situation, 
when 
somebody 
abuses 
ketamine," says Krystal. ''When abused, 
ketamine is often ingested in combination 
' 
with 
other 
substances 
that 
impair 
perception or judgment, like cannabis. 
The compounding of intoxicant effects 
could have unpredictable results." 
Such stigma 
has deterred some 
would-be research subjects. Nikolaidis 
first learned of the trial from his friend, 
Spencer Gray, another Yale junior who 
had been scheduled to participate in the 
study, but dropped out before it began. 
"I had some issues," says Gray, who has 
participated in a number of other Yale 
studies, including MRis and glucose 
tolerance tests. Gray's motivations, unlike 
his friend's, were primarily financial. "My 
parents told me to get a job last year;' 
Gray says, "so I carne up with the idea of 
doing experiments." The ketamine trial, 
which was advertised in the Yale post 
office, would have been a major windfall: 
completing.. the two week trial brought 
with it an $875 paycheck. 
Gray signed up for the experiment, 
went through a preliminary four-hour 
psychological evaluation, and consulted 
friends and acqua1ntances about' it. Many 
urged him to reconsider. His mother 
finally convinced him to change his 
mind. 
"She flipped out," Gray recalls. "I 
called her and told her I was thinking
