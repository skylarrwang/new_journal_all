renovates,

architects
tear
buildings
down
and
re-imagine. them. And when the Yale
School of Music's Dean, Robert Blocker,
imagines
with a $100 million gift at his
disposal he imagines shamelessly.
This July; the School of Music's
orchestra, the Philharmonia, will travel to
China to perform with Beijing's Central
Conservatory
a full Yale ensemble, five
· hundred Chinese singers, and two Yale
graduates flown in from. the Metropolitan
Opera, performing on one stage at . the
•
2008 Cultural Olympiad, the artistic
companion to the Olympic Games. But
how, Blocker asks, separated as they are
by seven thousand miles, will the entire
group be able to rehearse together
beforehand? Envision, for a moment,
the rehearsal room at Hendrie ·Hall,
one of Yale's musk buildings, which is
slated for full-scale renovation in May.
Blocker closes his eyes rapturously and
shifts his weight, imagining how such a
challenge could be tackled in future years.
Suppose Hendrie's May renovation could
be completed . in advance of the July
performance: "On one side. of the hall
will be a screeri showing a live video feed
of the group in China," he says, stretching
his · arms wide. "So we're in Connecticut,
they're in China, and the conductor could
be in London for all we care."

This musician's technological fantasy
would be uriimaginable to most of
the . classical music world, struggling
to
maintain its relevance in a modern
re Jnore
age. So how did Blocker's grand vision
become a viable reality for the School
of Music, which only a decade ago was
a small and relatively poor, if prestigious,
conservatory? First, the extraordinary:
two years ago, a well-wooed, anonymous
donor dropped $100 million into the
School's lap. Then, once tuition had been
eliminated, applications doubled, the food
at receptions gourmeted, and the School
.

began to enjoy the compound benefits of
attracting the best young musicians in the
world, top faculty to teach them, and ever
more attention and contributions for an
array of bracingly visionary projects.

What remains astonishing is how
little impact this growth has had on the
opportunities available to undergraduate
musicians at Yale. Students attracted to
Yale College because of its outstanding
music program are still regularly_ denied
access to professional music teachers
. .
and concert spaces. . The Departtnent
of
Music, · whose · professors
hold
degrees in music theory and history
rather than performance, and which is
far less moneyed than the professional
school, is responsible for the College's
sixty music majors, every music class
available to undergraduates, and all of the
undergraduate ensembles, including the
Yale Symphony Orchestra, the Glee Club,
and the Concert Band. The University
provides . them little financial support:-
smaller ensembles· often struggle to raise
funds and ·the YSO resorts to charging
performers for their own travel expenses
. on foreign tours and selling ten-dollar
tickets to the annual Halloween show.

The University attaches enormous
value to promoting performances and
maintaining a vibrant music culture. Yet
as the School of Music rockets happily
·skyward, undergraduates who came to
Yale for its music find themselves low
on resources, short on institutional
committnent, and going nowhere.

obert Blocker, Dean of the Yale
~ :.tlO<)l of Music, is a heavyset South
Carolinian whose white hair has receded
far back from his ruddy face. He is a living
legend among musicians at Yale. Blocker
has the disarming manner of bygone
gentility; his face is a screen of optimism,
his voice full of throaty conviction.

In 2005, Blocker left the School
of Music after ten years as its dean, a
• •
departing champion who had enlarged
the once-paltry $30 mi11ion endowment
five times over. Today, the Robert Blocker
Room, a portrait and plasma screen-filled
space dedicated in his honor, sits beside
the Morse Recital Hall in Sprague Hall,
the red brick building on College and Wall
Streets whose renovation he oversaw in
2003. Blocker's tenure, marked by rapid
fundraising, facilities renovations, and an
accompanying influx of highly regarded
faculty and students, was considered
remarkably successful.

After Blocker left Yale to become
the Provost of Southern Methodist
University, the alma mater of Laura Bush
and Harriet Miers, he and Levin quietly
continued to communicate with a donor
. who had expressed interest in offering a
large gift to the University. He or she had
been impressed with the School of Music
under Blocker's stewardship, and Blocker
and Levin suggested that giving to the
comparatively small program would have
an outsized impact.

The payoff of their efforts was almost
inconceivable. Thomas Duffy, the School
of Music's acting dean, announced the
news on the stage of Sprague Hall on
October 28, 2005, moments before
students were set to perform a selection
of scenes from lesser-known operas. He
· explained that the school had received
$100 million from an anonymous donor
and that new students would never pay
-tuition again. After a gasp and euphoric
release from the assembled students,
faculty, and audience, Duffy took his seat
and let the opera begin.

A year ago, Robert Blocker returned
to Yale like a conquering Roman general .
At one performance across the hall from
the room that bears Blocker's name,
Aldo Parisot, a spry, octogenarian cellist
and longstanding member of the faculty, ·
turned around between pieces he was
conducting to sing the Dean's praises.
"It turns out our problem all these years
was money,:ll.. he shouted. '~d thanks to
Dean Blocker, we've solved it!"

Despite Parisot's accolades, the $100
million is less than it appears. According
to a Yale policy, only 5 percent of all
endowments in this case, $5 million-
can be spent in a given year. The total
annual tuition of the School of Music's
215 students is almost precisely $5
mmion. Though the school is no longer
'IHE NEW JOURNAL


responsible for the generous financial aid
packages it . distributed before the gift,
it has · more or less committed itself to
a single use of the $100 million, at least
for the time being. As Margot Fassler, a
former dean of the Institute of Sacred
Music and current School of Music
professor, admitted, ''You can dream,
but we're right on the edge of having it
all spent."

It is difficult to imagine a single
investment in the school that could have
achieved more objectives at one time.
Subsidizing tuition instantly benefited
students. "It was the decisive factor," says
pianist Jessica Osborne of her decision
to enroll at the School of Music in 2006.
"I owe a lot of debt. I went to Jnilliard
and Indiana, and neither was free." While
debt is hardly an anomaly among graduate
students of any stripe, the problem is
typically more severe for music students,
whose futures are particularly precarious.
Classical
musicians,
even
those
December 2007
from the most prestigious schools, are
not guaranteed a job, let alone a good
one. "Music is just
how shall I say
it-difficult," says Michael Friedmann, a
professor of theory and chamber music
at the school. "People go into music
because they can't imagine doing anything
~
different, not because it is necessarily a
lucrative career." Yet this problem is no
easier for students at Yale's renowned
Drama School, which can offer only
need-based tuition to its students, men
and women generally headed to uncertain
freelance careers in theater.

or is it so
different for graduates of the Divinity
School, which, despite its phenomenal
$300 mi11ion endowment,
does not
subsidize its students' full tuition.

The School of Music
saw free
enrollment as particularly nece sary for
its students because of the enormous
start-up cost of an instrument. A pianist
like Osbourne wi11 likely begin her career
with an additional thit ty thou and dol1ar
of debt in order to buy a decent piano.
Violinists and other string players might
spend forty to one hundred thousand
dollars on their instruments and regularly
maintain them at the cost of several
hundred dollars a year. And a young
musician, even a great one, will typically
have to scrounge up this capital while
working several freelance jobs, flying to
international competitions, and striving to
capture the attention of a major orchestra
or agent. ''If I'm at the right place at the
right time, hopefully someone hears me,"
said Osbourne. Until then, she shrugs, ''I
could probably make a decent amount
doing odd jobs."

ubsidizing tuition has also served
~ the University's grander strategy of
gaining international prominence
attracting more international students to
Yale. Juilliard, the world's mo t famous
con ervatory, has always cast a long
