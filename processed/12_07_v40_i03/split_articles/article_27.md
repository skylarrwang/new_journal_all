merican radical and psychedelic 
drug pioneer Timothy Leary 
.. '-'nee said, "I am 100 percent in 
favor of the intelligent use of drugs and 
1 ,000 percent against the thoughtless use 
of them, whether caffeine or LSD." A 
similar sentiment might have been in the 
mind of Yale junior George Aki Nikolaidis 
when he volunteered to take small doses 
of the hallucinogen ketamine last July as 
part of a controlled experiment run by 
the Yale School of Medicine. 

"I started it mainly because I was 
36 
By 
curious in the research. Research in drugs -
I had a serious interest in," ·says Nikolaidis . 
"It appealed to me that I could experience 
a hard drug in a really safe, controlled 
setting." 

The study, which took place at the 
neurology department of the West 
Haven VA Medical Center in West Haven, 
Connecticut and was conducted by Yale 
professors, is part of an ongoing project 
to use ketamine to revolutionize the 
treatment of schizophrenia. 

''In the late 1980s and to this day," 
-
says John Krystal, lead investigator on 
the experiment, Robert L. McNeil, Jr. 
Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, 
and deputy_ chairman for research for 
the Department of Psychiatry, "our 
group of investigators at Yale studying 
schizophrenia were among the first 
groups in Connecticut and, in some cases, 
the world, to prescribe new medication 
treatments that were introduced for 
schizophrenia." 

Over a period of two weeks, Nikolaidis 
made four trips to the West Haven VA
