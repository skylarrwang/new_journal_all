**West Cornwall's Biodiesel Boost**

IF You DRIVE To W EST C o RNWAI.I., AS FEW bother to do these days, you'll find rnore collapse than innovation. A tiny comer of a tiny township in northwestern Connecticut, West Cornwall is far from anywhere and even further from the cutting edge. As a recent issue of the local Cornwall Chronicle reported, owners of the troubled Berkshire Country Store, with "its gas pumps long silenced and in need of replacement and its deli counter in need of business," decided to take action. Beth Cochran and her husband Rick are staking their decaying mom-and-pop store on a new approach they hope will catch fire: Connecticut's first biodiesel pump. 

The Cochrans aren't sure what the market for the alternative fuel will be. Customers at their gas station and grocery store are curious, said Rick. "Some people wonder what it is: Will it hurt my car? Will it run?" But the first month of sales has been promising. "It's selling just as well as the regular diesel.'' In early November, the Berkshire Country Store was selling its biodiesel for $3.65 per gallon, only about a nickel more than the regular diesel sold down the street. 

The Cochrans' livelihood depends on whether consumers believe sustainability is worth that nickel. Unlike conventional diesel fuel, which is derived from petroleum, biodiesel is derived from vegetable oil or animal fats. As pure biodiesel begins to congeal at low temperatures, New Englanders typically opt for a biofuel blend to ensure cold weather operability. The industry standard has become B20 20 percent biodiesel, 80 percent petrodiesel which is operational down to negative five degrees Fahrenheit.  This blend promises about a 16 percent reduction in C02 emissions. Biodiesel burns normally in any diesel engine and doesn't require modifications to the car. 

Gus Kellogg, founder of Greenleaf Biofuels in Milford, CT, explained that despite a growing demand for biodiesel fuel, stations franchised by oil companies like Exxon -or Chevron are prevented from marketing the fuel of independent distributors. "The real delay has been the fact that at branded stations, the owners have contracts," he says. "So, if you are a Mobil station, you have to sell Mobil oil." 
Like the Cochrans, Kellogg thinks that biodiesel can be marketed by independent retailers as something that sets them apart from the big name brands. ''As soon as we get the first station, there's going to be a domino effect. Because it's something that makes them a little bit unique." 

There are some signs that enthusiasm for biodiesel is spreading. Connecticut diesel drivers who are worried that the carbon footprint of a trip to West Cornwall will cancel out theÂ· benefits of burning biodiesel can visit the Santa Energy fueling station in  ew Haven. 
Although the station serves commercial customers, inclucling Yale's fleet of transit buses, it has been known to accommodate a handful of biodiesel-loyal independent drivers. Other distributors, like Greenleaf Biofuels and Hale Hill Farm Biofuels, even offer home delivery options. 

A grand opening ceremony to celebrate the new pump at the Berkshire Country Store, delayed to accommodate the governor's ribbon-cutting schedule, is in the works for some time before the new year. While not expecting record biodiesel sales, the owners hope that they can help educate Connecticut drivers. "The small mom-and-pop shops don't make a lot of money anyway," Rick Cochran confided. "We did it more as an awareness thing."
