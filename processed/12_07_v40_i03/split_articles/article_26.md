flux, with most of the links still under 
construction. Students are still debating 
· the benefits of several different models 
for the digital archive. Among them is one 
that Heyman refers to as a ''Y ouTube for 
human rights," where contributing coun-
tries can simply upload digitized docu-
ments to a central database. Another is 
known as the "S.WA.T. team approach," 
which would be operated by emissaries 
sent by the Artemis Project to work along-
side locals to help digitize documents on 
site. Both models respect the autonomy 
of the contributing truth commissions, a 
priority of the Project's founding mem-
bers that has persisted over the last three 
years. 


n 1999, Human Rights Watch had al-
_re: nu recorded tens of thousands of 
deaths, over 3 million displacements, and 
untold numbers of rapes and abductions 
during Sierra Leone's eleven- year civil 
war. These numbers would swell over the 
next three years, but amidst this strife and 
turmoil, the nation took its first step to-
ward healing by establishing a peace treaty 
between the government and the rebel 
forces. The peace treaty created the Sierra 
Leone Truth and Reconciliation Com-
mission to bear witness to the slaughter 
and wrongdoings of the previous decade. 
Even as the country moved forward, it 
was determined to remember its past. 
In December 2003, the TRC asked 
Christodulou, who had worked as a re-
searcher for the Commission for several 
months, to launch its National Vision 
Project with her friend Anthea Zervos, 
By the time Christodulou discussed the 
lack of a universal archive for truth com-
mission documents with Professor Hart-
man, she had already accepted the job. 
As a student of comparative literature, 
Christodulou was focused on literature 
as it related to communal memory, and 
it was this interest that compelled her to 
continue her work for the 'IRC. Chris-
todulou and Zervos began by fundrais-
ing together in New York City, and then 
traveled to Sierra Leone to start their field 
work in earnest. The idea was simple, says 
Zervos: ''You cannot change anything 
until you can first imagine it, until you can

The TRC ultimately published three 
volumes of findings in 2007, comprising 
34 
not only documents from the 
National Vision Project's col-
lection, but also recommenda-
tions, timelines, stories, and a 
list of victims. Christodulou's 
2003 .research for the TRC and 
the images she collected for 
the National Vision Project in 
2004 feature prominendy. 
As Christodulou's friends 
strive to bring the Artemis 
Project to life, ·the Project's 
namesake retains a palpable 
influence. "Her work, her em-
phasis on culturally sensitive 
responses to atr<,:>eity, and her 
unbridled enthusiasm for help-
ing people she had never met 
before direcdy motivated the 
Project," Feldman .says. "I've 
often said that if the accident 
hadn't occurred, Artemis her-
self would have led this proj-
ect and would have undoubt-
edly achieved far more than 
we have in three years." 
Still; says her father, "Now, we have 
a different Artemis. We can't pretend it 
never happened." 


fter returning to America, Chris-
todulou stayed in a care center in 
. Massachusetts for almost three years. 
Although she remains paralyzed and 
unable to speak, she was finally able to 
move home this September. Her family 
has specially outfitted a room with a lift, 
seating frame, and other equipment now 
necessary for her daily life. Some days she 
is well enough to spend up to an hour 
reading friends' e-mails and updates, of-
ten about Sierra Leone. "She likes read-
ing about this part of her life; she really 
enjoys that she did something that did 
good for humans. That part of her hasn't · 
changed," her father says. ''I feel that she 
understands this, that she remembers. I 
know she does." 


The Christodulous now devote their 
lives to Christodulou's comfort. Because 
she requires constant supervision, they 
stay awake with her on nights when the 
full-tirne caretakers they've hired fail to 
show up, help her exercise under the di-
rection of a physical therapist, and drive 
her to the mall sometimes for a change 
of scenery. Most recently, she returned 
to Massachusetts General Hospital for 
•• 
an operation to lengthen a tendon in her 
left elbow that her father hopes will allow 
her to rest her hand rather than keeping 
it clenched to her chest; now, she is grap-
pling with both the pain of the surgery 
and a constant nausea left by the anti-
inflammatory she was prescribed. The 
doctor suggested that Christodulou take 
Motrin with milk instead, to ease the pain, 
but her father doesn't think it will solve 
anything. "Every day she keeps crying, 
and every day we get some new medicine 
to help her," he says. 

He wonders if she might be grieving 
her mental limitations as well as her phys-
ical pain. "Sometirnes she can remember 
the past. When I talk to her, she closes 
her eyes and I can tell that she's follow-
ing the conversation, but a few minutes 
later, it's gone," he explains. "Such a mind 
like she had, how can so much be lost? 
It's so unbelievable. It's so painful." Chris-
todulou had a 3.87 GPA at Yale, he says. 
She was a candidate for the Marshall and 
Rhodes scholarships. She spoke English, 
French, Greek, and German fluently, and 
during her time in Sierra Leone,. she was 
able to pick up Krio. 

Most' importantly, while she worked 
for the 'IRC, Ch.ristodulou made genuine 
contributions toward national reconcilia-

tion. Her father recalls the stories she told 
him of enemies who had been brought 
together by her work, who'd once hated 
one another · and were now conununicat-
ing. Part of what drew Christodulou to 
truth commission work was her deter-
mination to preserve a full spec.trum of 
perspectives. Unlike courts, which are 
more focused on reparations, truth com- . 
missions catalogue perpetrators' perspec-
tives as well as victitns', and while court 
testimonies are often closed to. the com-
munity, truth commissions intend to im-
mortalize the stories they uncover in the 
public record. 

The loss of such materials is irrevo-
cable. In a nation such as Sierra Leone, 
with an estitnated adult literacy rate of 
just 35 percent, the pieces collected by the 
TRC represent the only voice many citi-
zens had in the healing process. "People 
who had nothing gave eve 
· g 
their 
time, their resources, their energy, to this 
restoration of Sierra Leone," says Zervos, 
who believes it is impossible to overesti-
mate the testimonies' significance to the 
country's future. "People could not look 
forward without looking back. The con-
flict has entirely shaped people's ability to 
think about the future.'' 

At Yale, these stories have permanent-
ly shaped the students who have worked 
to preserve them. Unlike many student 
causes, the Artemis Project remains in-
tegral to many of its members' lives. 
Alexi Zervos describes himself as an 
"unofficial advisor" to the Project, while 
Higonnet says that sh~ is in constant e-
mail contact with current particpants and 
library staff Feldman still contributes to 
reports and grant statements produced by 
project members. "It's almost addictive," 
says Heyman who is continuing. her work 
for the Artemis Project in Sierra Leone. 
The founders, many of whom have also 
had the opportunity to work for truth 
commissions abroad, are motivated by 
the significance of the individual . stories 
they've encountered, those pieces of his-
tory catalogued and sornetimes lost in the 
process of making a.II).ends. "They are the 
history, these untold stories that haven't 
been written in textbooks," says Carney. 
"They are a way for a society as a whole 
to move forward." 

ccording to Heyman, everyone who 
· · 
in truth commission 
December 2007 
work has heard at least one story that 
sticks. She encountered hers in 2005, 
when she was working for the post-geno-
cide National Unity and Reconciliation 
Commission in Rwanda. The man whose 
story touched Heyman the most deeply, 
she says, had come home from his job at 
a Muslim radio station to find his village 
slaughtered. "It seemed almost theatrical, 
the way you'd ask someone a question 
and get such a horror story in response," 
she says. "Someone works late for a day 
and comes home to find their entire fam-
ily dead behind a latrine, or that they are 
the only one left alive in their village." 

After the reconciliation, the man, a mem-
ber of the Tutsi ethnic group victimized 
during the genocide, became engaged to ~ 
Hutu woman. "His priest asked him, 'Do 
you really trust this ·woman? She'll kill 
you in your sleep,"' Heyman remembers.

ized by the war. "It was heart-wrench-
ing," she says. When she and Christodu-
lou walked past, they were unsure where 
to look 
they worried that staring would 
make the residents self-conscious, but 
wondered whether ignoring them would 
be worse. 

When Christodulou focused her TRC 
research on these amputations, Higonnet 
asked her how she managed to grapple 
with such devastating tragedy, day in and 
day out. "Tears welled up in her eyes, but 
she didn't cry," Higonnet remembers. 
"She just said, 'It's the right thing to do."' 

All of the Artemis Project's founding 
members tell similar stories chronicling 
Christodulou's incredible dedication. Al-
though her father used to ask himself 
whether he and his wife should have 
stopped their daughter from returning 
to Sierra Leone, whether he could have

The two married regardless, and he now 
works as a journalist for the BBC. "He 
faced a lot of opposition in practicing his 
own reconciliation," she says. 

Higonnet's story comes from the time 
she spent in Sierra Le_one in 2003, work-
ing for a special court with Alexi Zervos 
and sleeping beside Christodulou under 
a single spotty mosquito net. Although 
many of Higonnet's experiences in the 
court are bound by confidentiality, she 
is plagued by the memory of what she 
calls the "signature atrocity'' of the Sierra 
Leone civil war: the legendary "amputa-
tions" performed by the Rebel United 
Front, one of the warring parties. 

The rebels cut off their · hostages' 
hands, arms, noses, lips, ears 
tactics that 
typified the sheer brutality and lasting im-
pact of the war. Higonnet describes art iv-
ing in Sierra Leone for the first time and 
being dt iven past an amputee camp where 
she saw even the smallest children vicrirn-
a atn:ne. '' 
prevented the accident, he now realizes 
that nothing they could have done would 
have stopped her from doing the work 
she thought was important 
she was too 
touched by the tragedies she'd encoun-
tered to do anything but help. 

"It's hard to describe how enormous-
ly vibrant she was," Alexi Zervos muses. 
"She had this enormous passion for the 
truth commissions, and for the victims. 
She was simply inspirational." 

I .ike the truth commissions she was 
committed to, Christodulou tried to heal 
nations with stories. Ironically, her own 
story has become just one of the count-
less individual tragedies the Artemis Proj-
ect is determined to remember. 

For everyone involved, says Zervos, 
'".,.....I'his project is important because it 
bears her name."
