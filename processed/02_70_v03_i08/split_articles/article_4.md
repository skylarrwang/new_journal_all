can be traced to a guild outlook, emerg-
ing tentatively from a dimly recalJed past 
when teachers were teachers, masters of a 
field and carriers of a culture, and students 
were students, who came to Jearn. It is a 
teacher's business to decide what is to be 
taught. Of course in some measure his 
decision is made for him by his culture. 
But how else can you define a teacher? 
How can a syllabus be a negotiable issue? 
Moreover, teachers want to think that 
their subject makes a difference, that it is 
not merely a subject but an access to 
significance, an opening to a higher life. 
This idea of teaching has been called 
elitist, and in part it is. A major sociologi-
cal fact of university life in the past gener-
ation is that many teachers, particularly 
in the humanities, bring to their work an 
unmistakable sense of superiority to their 
students. It rests not only on differences 
of training and expertness, but also on 
differences of values. It is felt to be a con-
dition of life that to teach literature, art, 
and philosophy, it is necessary to wean 
most students from the culture of their 
backgrounds, a culture of provincial man-
ners, of puritanical practices, of con-
stricted, not to say crippling emotions. The 
students we have called "best" are those 
who display a sensibility for a "higher life," 
those who come to share our contempt for 
the mass culture of American society. 
The idea of a cultural mission of the 
university is frequently evoked by those 
who worry about the anti-intellectualism 
of students. This worry has been transfer-
red, it is interesting to note, from the 
average, sluggish student-the typical mid-
dle-class American youth-to the radical 
and activist student, who is often also the 
"best. ... " 

Now we are taken unawares by the fact 
that even-indeed, especia/ly~ur "best" 
students seem no longer interested in any 
. version of the "higher life." This raises an 
extremely sensitive issue. Far from sharing 
our contempt-and fear-of mass culture, 
many students are now embracing it. 

A comment like Richard Goldstein's in 
The Poetry of Rock, that "America's single 
greatest contribution to the world has 
been her Pop (music, cinema, painting, 
even merchandising)," that "mass culture 
can be as vital as high art," must surely 
meet with wide approval among the young. 
This idea, put in such simple terms, reveals 
a dilemma. To be sure, notions of "high" 
and "low" tend to become formal conven-
tions; genteel sanctions do frequently 
compete with intrinsic sanctions in "high" 
culture, and "official" academic values 
can stifle art and deny it the nourishment 
of new experience. The "higher life" does 
threaten to externalize itself, to yield to 
the satisfactions of an insignia, of manners 
and elegant speech-in short, snobbishness 
-instead of maintaining itself as an inner 
condition, a freedom and subtlety of mind 
and feeling. 

Moreover, the badge of culture, like aJI 
badges and uniforms, can be put to anti-
democratic uses. Whitman charged that 
the word "Culture" was an enemy of 
Democracy. It separated people into 
castes, it projected an aristocratic hier-
archy of worth. A hundred years ago he 
wrote: "Of all the dangers to a nation, as 
things exist in our day, there can be no 
greater one than having certain portions of 
the people set off from the rest by a line 
drawn-they not privileged as others, but 
degraded, humiliated, made of no ac-
count." It is still a danger. The academic 
idea of "high" culture, which was won 
against the genteel tradition of earlier 
generations, has often, and often unwit-
tingly, served as a fence around a special 
preserve of experiences. The academy has 
seen itself as a means of liberation from 
the hold of bourgeois values-usually 
abstracted as "materialism," as if that 
exhausted the matter-and from the banal-
ities and easy satisfactions, what Whitman 
called the "half sleep," of mass culture. 

Yes. But the alternative has tended to 
become a brand of its own. The exclusion 
of black, of immigrant, of working-class 
and ethic experiences from university cul-
ture is one instance. The insistence of 
"third world" students that the university 
not deprive them of their historical culture 
(even where they have to scratch to find 
evidence of one), not compel them to 
forget their language and their customs, 
but instead equip them with the means to 
foster cultural self-consciousness among 
their people, is precisely to this point. 

Anthropology alone should have taught 
us that there are many ways of conceiving 
a. "higher life," and that cultural depriva-
tron robs a man as ruinously as any other 
form of banditry. But the demand that the 
university redefine its cultural role in light 
of the multiplicity of American life (a 
severe undertaking under any circum-
stances) is one thing, and the demand, 
implicit in much of the protest, that it 
rej~ct the life of the mind altogether, is 
qurte another. One of the reasons for stif-
fening faculty resistance is an uneasy 
feeli!'lg that while the students may be 
acting out of and thereby reviving ethical 
imperatives, they may also be enacting a 
mindlessness we have always felt as an 
intimidating presence in American life. 

The quest for "pure" experience, the sub-
stitution of sensation for thought, the flight 
from discipline-these have been historical 
features of American culture. In conflict 
with opposite ideas identified with 
"Europe," ideas of tradition, authority, 
and complexity, they have leavened much 
of our literature and thought. 

But detached from their opposites, cele-
brated as self-evident goals in their own 
right, these impulses toward anarchic 
freedom lose the very conditions which 
made them meaningful, and radical, in 
earlier periods. Yes, our young radicals 
have rejected, with refreshing spirit and 
elan, much of the musty and cramped 
style of middle-class life. They are loose, if 
they are nothing else. But their rejection 
takes a form that might in the end rein-
force the institutions they want to over-
turn. The glorification of Pop, for example, 
suggests that as profoundly as the young 
feel alienated from their society, they are 
right at home in its culture. 

Insofar as the mood of rebellious students 
represents skepticism toward the pieties of 
national life, toward the evasion of intel-
lectuals and academics, and toward the 
present state of knowledge-especially the 
split between value and fact reflected in 
the absurdly compartmentalized university 
curriculum-the mood invites faculty sup-
port and alliance. But there is cause to 
worry and for criticism in the degree in 
which student radicalism deviates from 
democratic and socialist thought, and veers 
in the direction of a "counterculture" 
which is capturing many Americans. 

In part campus unrest conforms to the 
wave of changes in personal style that defy 
political or racial lines. It is a style that 
stresses the self-sufficiency of adventure, 
experiment, spontaneity.lt is a style of 
repudiation, and it brooks no interference 
with "free" expression. We see it in the 
arts: in theater and film and music. Most of 
all we see it in fashion. It might be mis-
taken for a new avant-garde movement, 
but an avant-garde with such popular 
appeal should make us suspicious. It is 
more likely that the mass media are catch-
ing up with the earlier avant-garde move-
ments-Dada, surrealism, theater of cruelty 
-and detaching mannerisms and tactics 
from their theoretical foundations as a 
calculated critique of bourgeois culture and 
vestigial classicism and formalism. What 
was assault then, has by now become sheer 
mannerism, sheer sensation. 

The mass media are playing an unpre-
cedented role in propagating a "counter-
culture" with the flavor of "now!" Think 
of the importance of rock. Its practitioners 
are no longer entertainers but gurus. The 
music and its makers are celebrated-the 
proper word may be promoted- not only 
for the excitement of rhythm and sound, 
but for their message, their litany of liber-
ation. And their message inspires a craving 
for what? For more of the same, as the 
record industry well knows. The same 
message, the same inducement to "do your 
own thing" and to "let it all hang out" 
can be heard in theater, in film, in the very 
visible "underground press,' in the mush-
rooming "encounter groups." Writing in 
Esquire, Elenore Lester has described the 
message as this: "Try hallucinogens: they 
drive you out of your wretched mind. Try 
nudity: it returns you to your sanity. Try 
multi-media baths: they stretch the sen-
sorium. Try confrontation: it cleanses the 
psyche. Try revolution: it energizes the 
environment." 

In its disregard for theory generally, the 
New Left has pretty much ignored the 
media and has failed to develop a critical 
point of view toward mass commu{lica-
tions. Slogans from McLuhan and murky 
fragments from Marcuse have served in 
lieu of analysis. This is not the entire 
answer, but neglect of theory has helped 
make radicalism susceptible to media 
exploitation-and the exploitation is bla-
tant; mind-blowing is a major industry. 

There is a belief abroad that changes in 
hair style, in dress, in sexual habits consti-
tute a rejection of the social order and 
prepare you for revolution. The new style 
is supposed to be more "authentic"; the 
fact that it is also fashionable does not 
seem to occur to its defenders. Some intel-
lectuals, whose sensibility has been formed 
in the modernist movement, are sometimes 
prone to hail any sign of the "new" as a 
spark of life, and to enjoy the idiosyncratic 
and the bizarre for their own sakes, for the 
"hell of it." Rather than a process of 
mastering social reality by will and 
thought, revolution has come to mean 
something dangerously close to sheer 
impulse. 

Granted, the energy invested in cultural 
rebellion, in acid-rock insurrection against 
the old ethic of deferring pleasure for the 
sake of profit, may have a revolutionary 
potential. "In a culture judged as inor-
ganic, dead, coercive, authoritarian,'' 
writes Susan Sontag, "it becomes a revolu-
tionary gesture to be alive .... Bending 
the mind and shaking loose the body makes 
someone a less willing functionary of the 
bureaucratic machine. Rock, grass, better 
orgasms, grooving on nature-really 
grooving on anything- unfits, maladapts a 
person for the American way of life."
