Can you smell it yet? Or see it or hear it? Rachel Carson, 
DDT and the silentis majoritatis notwithstanding, the 
first signs of a not so silent spring have already begun 
to show through here and there. The liberal-radical-
revolutionary animals are beginning to stir from their 
winter-induced dormant state. 

The hibernation was not a deep one this year, or a 
very lengthy one either. To be sure, little has lately been 
heard from the Moratorium Committee which seems to 
be involved in backroom discussions on what to do about 
next fall's Congressional elections (one of the Yale directors having gone so far as to drop out of the Law School 
to work on the Duffey campaign), but the other peace 
and revolution groups have begun to gear up again. 

With fascinating existential irony the anti-war people 
are beginning to use against the government the very cry 
they have so often found turned against themselves: law 
and order. The Boston Five, the Milwaukee Fourteen 
and the D.C. Nine are going back to court, but they are 
returning as plaintiffs, not defendants. 

A number of anti-war elder statesmen like Reverend 
Coffin, Noam Chomsky, Marcus Raskin and Staughton 
Lynd, for example, have initiated proceedings against 
the Dow Chemical Company for producing "chemical, 
biological, bacteriological, incendiary and asphyxiatory 
weapons" which are being used to violate international 
law in Vietnam. Mentioned in the suit are napalm and a 
controversial herbicide, which is thought by some scientists to have mutagenic consequences for men. The 
plaintiffs contend that the Ninth Amendment to the 
Constitution gives citizens the right to start a suit if the 
government refuses to do so or is violating its own laws. 

In a slightly nitpicking statement to the Times, the 
group's attorney, Alan Scheflen of Georgetown University, said the suit is not designed to test the legality of 
United States presence in Vietnam, but just the legality 
of particular actions the United States is undertaking 
there-like using napalm. He hopes thereby to keep the 
case from being thrown out of court as a "political 
question." 

The New Mobe, in an imaginative exhibition of peace-
minded creativity, has come up with an interesting legal 
maneuver of its own. As part of its Draft Week program 
scheduled for the second week of March, the Mobe will, 
in a seeming change of philosophy and tactics, start urging people to comply with the Selective Service Act, or 
at least the part which says registrants must send to their 
boards all information which may be relevant for future 
Selective Service matters. The Mobe plans to ask people 
to send their boards anything and everything they can 
think of as frequently as they can. Some suggestions are 
regular letters about the registrant's thoughts on the war, 
life, philosophy and the draft; all books, pamphlets and 
articles which have affected his thinking; also Bibles, 
sermons, speeches and, if possible, daily health reports. 
The registrant is to ask his board to place all these things 
in his file. The idea is to create so much busywork for 
the boards that they won't have time to perform their 
regular tasks of conscripting an army. The plan has its 
flaws of course (since, for example, the Post Office Department rather than the draft boards would probably be 
the first government casualty), but its poetic beauty 
cannot be denied. 

All concerned admit, however, that these are only 
minor harassing actions. Reverend Coffin thinks the 
Nixon public relations offensive has substantially limited 
the value of more peace movement p.r. efforts. At the 
same time the Chicago trial, aside from keeping the 
movement active during the winter, has shown that it is 
not always profitable to use the law to quiet dissent. So 
the sides are switching weapons. Next thing you know 
Spiro Agnew will be leading marches on the Pentagon, 
and Norman Mailer will file suit to deny him a parade 
permit. 


**Title: Panther 14 + winter = 8**
**Page number(s): 3**

In radical numbers parlance, the New Haven "Panther 
14" just ain't what they used to be. As months of pre-trial 
hearings near an end, the "Panther 14" have shrunk to 
the "Panther Five plus Three," and the police privately 
indicate that they expect more drop-outs within the 
coming weeks. 

Of the fourteen Panthers arrested last year for the 
alleged torture-slaying of fellow Panther Alex Rackley, 
only five now being held in Connecticut jails will face trial 
on murder charges. Three more, including party chairman Bobby Seale, are fighting extradition to Connecticut. 
It is conceivable, though unlikely, that all eight could 
burn in the Connecticut electric chair, if found guilty 
of murder. 

Six of the original fourteen are no longer connected 
with the case. Three defendants have pleaded guilty, and 
three more have had their cases disposed of for a variety 
of reasons. They include two juveniles and Frances 
Carter, who was granted immunity from prosecution but 
was still given a six-month jail term for contempt of 
court when she refused to testify last month. The three 
to plead guilty to lesser charges are Loretta Luckes; 
Warren Kimbro, the reputed former head of the local 
Panther chapter; and George Sams Jr. of Highland Park, 
Michigan who implicated Seale in the case after his 
arrest last summer. 

Sams, who local Panthers claim is a "police agent," 
said Seale assigned him and two others (Kimbro and 
Lonnie McLucas) the task of executing Rackley, a New 
York City Panther who, police say, was suspected by 
his colleagues of being a turncoat. McLucas, the only 
one of the alleged three-man execution squad not to 
plead guilty, will be tried separately from the other eight 
Panthers who are still asserting their innocence. Panthers 
say the severed trial for McLucas is an attempt to isolate 
and destroy him. Sources in the State Attorney's Office 
privately maintain that they have a tight case against 
McLucas, including a possibly damaging statement from 
the defendant himself. 

The case against the other Panthers is not altogether 
as convincing, at least according to testimony uncovered 
in weeks of pre-trial hearings. W. Paul Flynn, defense 
attorney for accused Panther George Edwards, says most 
of the testimony implicating his client is "hearsay based 
on hearsay." He and six other defense attorneys have 
tried to undermine the validity of tips and information
