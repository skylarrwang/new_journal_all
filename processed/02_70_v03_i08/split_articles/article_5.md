95% of films a re born of frus-
tration; of self-despair, of 
poverty, of ambition, for sur-
vival, for money, for fattening 
bank accounts.

Is the "American way" really in danger 
from such gestures? The fact is that the 
"American way" itself has cultivated these 
impulses, has set them up as its secretly-
admired version of what it means to be 
"different." Are we witnessing the middle-
class, in a mood of self-hate and anxiety 
about its "authenticity," turning against 
itself by turning itself inside out? The 
fantastic notion that if only the "uptight" 
middle-class would "turn on," war and 
poverty would cease, the air would depot-
lute itself, and capitalism self-destruct 
has become a pleasant fantasy, and for that 
reason so effective a piece of vicarious 
entertainment for the middle class itself. 

And the pugnacious idea that all authority 
is evil, rather than specific uses of author-
ity, serves to obscure the causes of war 
and poverty within the present structure of 
society; it raises a straw man in place of 
concrete analysis. 

In the student movement there is a consid-
erable amount of discussion of theory; 
but theatricality, gesture, the hope for 
"instant revolution"-not to speak of indis-
criminate terror-seem often more 
prominent than the effort to arrive at clear, 
persuasive statements of issues and map-
ping of strategy. The cry for "relevance" 
is a case in point. It is another example of 
an emerging pattern of impatience with 
analysis and contempt for history.lt is also 
an example of the debasement of a good 
idea through sloganizing. Many faculty 
members are vulnerable to the cry because 
inwardly they apply a standard of rele-
vance to their own work, but they recog-
nize how complex, how tentative, how 
problematic the standard can be. The 
current idea of what is knowledge ought 
always to justify itself in light of criticism; 
that indeed is the function of intellectuals. 

Perspectives on the past always reflect, 
with greater or Jesser degrees of awareness, 
the influence of the present. Students make 
a valuable point when they attack much 
of what passes for "objective" knowledge 
as formalistic and ideological, as knowl-
edge serving specific political and social 
aims under the guise of neutrality. They 
are right to try to penetrate to the social 
purposes and uses of curriculum. 

But in demanding relevance students 
often assume that only the contemporary, 
which is to say the fashionable at the 
moment, is worth bothering about, that 
history, being dead, should be junked, that 
they themselves are the arbiters of what is 
relevant or not, living or dead. "Swamped 
with presentness," as Paul Goodman puts 
it, they seem unwilling to acknowledge 
that the "present" is a supremely difficult 
entity to define. Whitehead wrote that "the 
present contains all there is," that is, as 
an accumulation of the past, the present is 
the only possible locus of thought and 
action. This casts a somewhat different 
light on "relevance." Of course the present 
matters in a way the past does not; the 
future matters most of all. With more of a 
regard for history, students who cry for 
relevance might be better able to extrapol-
ate from the present the best possibilities 
for a desirable future. 

But it would be a hopeful sign if mixed 
feelings began to appear among the stu-
dents as well. Recent history has raised the 
pitch of contradiction within society, and it 
would be strange if individuals did not feel 
the effects. Inner conflicts is a sign that 
history still matters. Such coofticts can 
serve as revelations of the state of the 
world, within and without. The faculty 
might help keep alive a sense of the final 
uncertainty of the nature of student 
activism. It is senseless to exchange 
slogans, to hurl reproaches. It will be tragic 
if we allow the present agitation to settle 
in our minds as a discipline problem, just 
as it is tragic for radical students to feel no 
need for further education. 

It is hard to say where hope for are-
newed university lies. But surely it does not 
lie in repression of any sort. "In every era," 
wrote Walter Benjamin, "the attempt must 
be made anew to wrest tradition away 
from a conformism that is about to over-
power it." Unexpectedly, conformism has 
appeared in the camp of rebellion as well 
as in the main body of society. But we 
cannot allow that fact to obscure the larger 
questions, of what we mean by university, 
by society, by culture at all. It is ironic 
that we are moved to puni$h students who 
have, no matter how unceremoniously, 
raised these questions. A better motive 
would be to help transform their assault 
into a reasoned critique and a program for 
change. The immediate problem is to 
restore the possibility of discourse. â€¢
