Comment: OCD goes to court, as does the

but will the Pro Musica stay free? 


**Title: Yale Daily strikes again**

Like the outstanding college newspaper that it is, the 
Yale Daily News has never shrunk from taking on any 
number of awesome and powerful opponents whenever 
the cause seems just. Last year, as just one example, 
the News courageously conducted an open feud with 
the allegedly dictatorial Dean of the drama school, 
Robert Brustein, and twice called for his resignation. 
So it should come as no surprise to any conscientious 
reader of the Oldest College Daily to hear that the 
News has now decided to take on the Yale Record over 
the humor magazine's use of the News trademark and 
copyright in an exam-time parody issue. 

Members of the News business staff have sent a letter 
to Record Chairman Thomas Carney threatening the 
Record with a law suit. The News is seeking all the 
profits from the issue (probably several hundred dollars 
from advertisers), plus another two hundred and fifty 
dollars for damages. Carney learned from the letter, 
that ironically, the News lawyer happens to be the 
Record's lawyer, and the Record now plans to get rid of 
him. Carney also says he may reprint the letter on the 
cover of the Record's next issue. 

Ah but things are becoming formal these days. Not 
too long ago such a matter would have been settled in 
open contest on the bladderball field, where every man 
must be a man. Why just last year the News itself informally ducked out of a potential libel suit from Olivia's 
Restaurant (for referring to that establishment's produce 
as "scumburgers") with a few strategically-aimed soothing words and a printed retraction. 

Yet maybe the News does have a point after all. If the 
Record gets away with this travesty-which it really was 
since the parody issue was distinctly unfunny-who 
knows where it will all end? The Banner, the Alumni 
Magazine, even the Yale Scientific might get into the act. 
But please don't worry, fellows and girls of the OCD, 
for we, at least, have no intentions of going daily. Bi-
weekly is just fine for us. And we don't plan on being 
particularly funny either, just for the Record.
