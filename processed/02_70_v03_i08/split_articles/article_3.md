**Title: Culture and rebellion: the dilemma of the radical professor**
**Author: Alan Trachtenberg**
**Page number(s): 3-6**

The following article, which originally ap-
peared in Dissent was rewritten by the 
author for The New Journal. Mr. Trach-
tenberg, a member of the faculty of 
Pennsylvania State University, is cur-
rently Visiting Associate Professor of 
English and American Studies. He is 
teaching courses on twentieth century 
American literature and "The City: 
Images & Ideas." 

In the eyes of many college faculty mem-
bers, the student activist movement wears 
the aspect of a sinister contagion. We hear 
accusations of "left fascism," of a new 
barbarism at the gates. Many people see 
the student protests as a symptom of 
larger, deeper disorders, a failure of au-
thority throughout society, a collapse of 
cultural values which have stood for 
centuries, an epidemical regression to 
infantilism. In regard to the university 
itself, a common response is that student 
radicals seem willing to eliminate the baby 
with the dirty bath water, that while they 
have done a service to call attention to 
the need of reform, they have by now gone 
beyond a meliorist crusade and are at-
tacking fundamental values without which 
no university is possible. The resort to 
violence-at least what looks like violence 
to most people-suggests that political 
goals have gotten enmeshed in anti-political 
intentions: it seems hard now to distinguish 
whatever may be sound in their moral 
aims from the intolerable nihilism and 
anarchism, so-called, of their behavior. 
Listen for the tune, not the words, and you 
hear sounds discordant with the humane 
goals of social transformation many aca-
demics were initially attracted to. 

Does the movement take its character 
from the words or the tune? Has the tune 
which sometimes sounds like a rock cacophony, come to prevail over the words, 
the principles and theories of social criti-
cism, or is the point that tune and words 
are now one, that the students have 
achieved an authentic expressive form for 
their political and social vision? Some 
older radicals seem already to have decided: if SDS is making a revolution, they 
say, they might very well line up on the 
other side. Social justice, freedom of 
thought and egalitarianism seem to have 
better defenders, they feel, among parliamentary liberals than among New Left 
anarchists. 

My own position is less certain, and I 
suspect that my mixed feelings and divided 
loyalties are shared by at least a small 
number of academics on every campus. 
Faced with growing pressure to line up 
against the students, to resist demands 
backed up by threat of force, to defend 
rational process and disinterestedness as 
ends in themselves, we are stuck in a dilemma. The pressure is to see the protests as 
discipline problems, as the Yale administration saw the disruption of some classes 
by radical students just before Christmas, 
and to define the campus issues under the 
heading of control and punishment. But in 
some moods student uprisings seem an 
avenging angel come to haunt us with our 
own little sins, compromises and equivocation, which suddenly loom as a major 
guilt-the guilt of being an academic, a 
scholar, a teacher, while wars rage and 
people starve. What kind of commitment 
is it we have made to Truth that takes 
locked files and riot police to protect? Does 
rational process include university-supported war research, ROTC, social 
engineering? Do we really mean disinterestedness, or passivity, and isn't neutrality 
often a cover for complicity? The way 
most universities are run, can we honestly 
speak of reason and humane learning as 
central values? 

These questions have bothered us long 
before the occupation of buildings. True, 
we may have allowed ourselves to drift 
into careers that have deflected our attention from such issues. For many of us, 
the academic campaign against the Vietnam war a few years ago represented a 
repoliticalization, a reactivation of older 
ambitions and passions. I am not sure how 
widespread is the feeling of a strain between demands of career and demands of 
politics. But that is not exactly the dilemma I refer to, for it is a personal matter, a 
question of priorities in use of time and 
energy. Whatever doubt we may feel is not 
over militarism, racism, or the structure 
of social privilege which discriminate in 
education against the poor and the ethnic 
minorities. Whatever else, we feel the 
university as well as society at large ought 
to free itself from these intolerable conditions. 

But our own experiences have led us to 
value the university in a way apparently 
incomprehensible to student radicals. For 
most of us the university has represented 
access to a culture fundamentally at odds 
with that of the larger society, a counter-
vailing culture that honors the development of consciousness, and reading, 
thinking and writing as the faculties of 
consciousness. It may sound excessive to 
say so, but the university has been a sort 
of salvation for many of us, salvation from 
the confinements and destructive ends, the 
dilution of ideas and culture, in the larger 
society. True, the academy exacts its own 
price, has its own intellectual and emotional pitfalls. Yes, scholarship and criticism is often exasperatingly pretentious, 
overwrought and stupid. The academic 
mind can be just as insulated from experiences outside its limits as any other and 
just as arrogant and patronizing about its 
own values. But why characterize the 
university only by its worst features? The 
university is perhaps the sole institution 
that makes accessible to its members the 
grounds of self-criticism, the only formal 
"place" arranged for free discussion, where 
the inherited and the contemporary can 
confront each other openly, where a usable 
tradition can be elicited from the encounter of old and new. 

Only a few years ago collaboration 
between students and faculty in behalf of a 
better university seemed natural. The 
enemy was seen as the administration. Its 
extensive bureaucracy, its machinery of 
manipulation, its budget-minded caution 
seemed to represent, as Thorstein Veblen 
argued in The Higher Learning in America 
(1918), the invasion of business-minded 
habits of thought into the academy. We 
seemed agreed on the necessity of freeing 
the "higher learning" from, in Veblen's 
words, "the manner of life enforced on the 
group by the circumstances in which it is 
placed." 

In the past year, however, the situation 
has tipped. Students are now more likely 
to find support, especially for demands of 
increased power over educational policy, 
from administrators who are coming to 
see their function as one of diplomacy and 
negotiation. And from the faculty they 
are more likely to meet a stubborn clinging 
to notions of standards and integrity and 
traditional prerogatives. Faculty resistance
