continued from page 2 
which police obtained from two, as yet 
unidentified, Panther informants. All the 
while, the Panther lawyer.s have been 
insisting that their clients should be 
granted bail and released pending trial. 
The six Panthers being detained in Con-
necticut have claimed that they have been 
"'harassed and both mentally and physical· 
ly intimidated"' in jail. 
The greatest setback to both defense 
lawyers and Panther supporters, so far, 
has been the guilty plea of Warren Kim-
bro. Although Sams has been labeled a 
police agent from the start by local Pan~ 
thers, they have been unwilling to cast their 
former local leader in a similar opprobious 
light. Rather, they have charged that Kim-
bro was pressured into a confession by 
Sergeant Vincent DeRosa, a member of 
the New Haven Police Intelligence Divi-
sion and an old acquaintance of Kimbro 
who visited him in prison, four days prior 
to his guilty plea. 
Kimbro said he initiated the discussion 
with Sergeant DeRosa, but Kimbro's 
former lawyer, George Johnson, claimed 
that DeRosa's visit was in violation of 
Kimbro's constitutional rights. Johnson, 
who since has been discharged by Kimbro, 
said he never was notified of the sergeant's 
visit. Kimbro, in rebuttal, said be was "sick 
and tired of being used." The only pressure 
on him to plead guilty, he said, was "the 
pressure of conscience." 
But, there undoubtedly have been other 
pressures on Kimbro, besides simply those 
of "conscience." His brother, William, a 
member of an out-of-state intelligence 
unit, has told this reporter in a telephone 
interview that he did visit Kimbro, shortly 
before he entered his guilty plea. Beyond 
that, William Kimbro would not elaborate. 
In addition, this reporter discovered in 
New Haven County court files that Kim-
bro's wife, Sylvia, instituted divorce pro-
ceedings against her h!Jsband, whose bouse 
at 365 Orchard St. was once the local 
Black Panther headquarters. In a motion 
for Kimbro to vacate his house, Mrs. 
Kimbro's Ia~yer, David M. Lesser, said 
Kimbro "permitted his acquaintances the 
continuous use of the premises" without 
his wife's consent. That divorce motion 
was filed in April, 1969. One month later, 
twenty New Haven policemen raided the 
Kimbro house and arrested every moving 
body inside on charges of murder and kid-
napping-everyone, that is, except for 
Mrs. Kimbro and a monkey found in the 
kitchen. 
According to testimony from Inspector 
Stephen Ahern, brother of the New Haven 
police chief, Mrs. Kimbro was later 
arrested at her own request for "disturbing 
the peace." Some Panther defense lawyers 
maintain that Ahern's remark may have 
been just a "red herring" in an attempt to 
link Mrs. Kimbro with one of the two 
unidentified informants, one of whom is 
a female, according to the police. 
Beyond the "whodunit" aspects of the 
proceedings, several important questions 
remain. Will Bobby Seale's lawyer, Charles 
Garry, be allowed to represent his client 
in his toughest court fight ever? Will the 
Panther trial(s) in New Haven turn into 
guerrilla theatre? And what, ultimately, 
will happen to the local Black Panther 
organization? 
As to the first question, several legal 
sources interviewed who asked to remain 
anonymous said they felt that Seale, who 
is slated to face re-trial in the Chicago 
conspiracy case on April23, will not be 
allowed to have Garry as his counsel. For 
the second question, one can only specu-
late that clashes between the Court and 
the Panthers, who have been quiet so far, 
might begin if and when they face separate 
trials. State's Attorney Arnold Markle, by 
asking for separate trials, would be under-
cutting Black Panther attempts at "soli-
darity." And as for the future for the local 
Panthers, that may depend as much on 
the trial itself as on anything else. Accord-
ing to informed sources in the police 
department, the Panthers numbered eigh-
teen prior to last year's raid. and zero 
following it. Now, again according to 
police sources, through the efforts of 
out-of-town chapters, the party has grown 
in strength to a current estimated size of 
twenty-five members. The New Haven 
Panthers, headed by area captain Doug 
Miranda are trying to build a community 
base through their free breakfast program

' 
and political "consciousness" campaigns. 
Still, they have to disprove the charge that 
they executed one of their own if they 
want to save their brothers' and sisters' 
necks, and maybe even their own.
