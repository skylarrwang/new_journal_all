ProMusica 
Few people know what krummhorns, 
kortholts, and sackbuts are. Of those that 
know they are musical instruments, fewer 
yet know how to begin to play them. Last 
October, Yale discovered that a good 
number of people wanted to learn when 
the New York Pro Musica spent a week 
in residence here. The Pro Musica's week 
of concerts and rehearsal seminars, 
though, was only the first half of an ex-
periment in the teaching of old music at 
Yale. The second half of the experiment 
will be conducted next week when the Pro 
Musica returns to present a new produc-
tion of a liturgical drama. This experiment 
may lead to the long-term residence at 
Yale of the Pro Musica, one of the few 
groups in America to present faithfully 
the neglected works of the Middle Ages, 
the Renaissance and the Baroque. 
The Pro Musica's appearances at Yale 
this year was arranged by Professor Wil-
liam G. Waite, Director of Graduate 
Studies in History of Music and Richard 
French of the Pro Musica Board of Direc-
tors. The appearances were regarded as a 
trial run for a possible term of residence. 
The two concerts presented September 
30th and October 3rd and the seminars 
conducted between the concerts were met 
by an unexpected response. At the first 
program, the Pro Musica performed music 
of the Italian Courts at the end of the 
Renaissance, including madrigals by 
Claudio Monteverdi and works of less 
renowned composers Cristofano Mal-
vezzi, Giaches de Wert and Bastian 
Chilese. Despite the fact that it was a 
Tuesday, Sprague Hall was packed, pre-
dominantly by the young. One faculty 
member saw it as a "Woodstock in minia-
ture," and the feeling of the audience was 
serious and appreciative. 
Medieval and Renaissance music of 
England was the program for the second 
concert on Friday. The music of William 
Byrd, John Bull, Orlando Gibbons et al 
brought out an even greater crowd than 
had shown up Tuesday. 
The Pro Musica's appearance at Yale 
in March is planned to be more intensely 
integrated into the existing curriculum 
than was its appearance in October. In-
stead of conducting independent seminars 
on old music, the Pro Musica will visit the 
classes teaching the performance of old 
music. Outside of this week-long activity, 
the members of the ensemble will partici-
pate on March 5th in a joint seminar of the 
faculties of the French and History of 
Music departments. The seminar, to be 
moderated by Professor Howard Garey, 
will discuss relations between poetry and 
music in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen-
turies which will be musically illustrated 
by the Pro Musica. 
The central program, though, of the 
Pro Musica's residence this month will be 
the new production of a twelfth century 
Easter play-the Resurrection Play of 
Tours. A dress rehearsal will take place 
Friday, March 6, following a medieval 
studies symposium in the morning and a 
panel discussion concerning the liturgical 
drama in the afternoon. The actual per-
formance of the Resurrection Play wiJl be 
presented Saturday evening at Christ 
Church on Broadway. 
The events planned for March are far 
more extensive than those of October. The 
plan, after all, is to pack into a week what 
might take place in two months of perman-
ent residence. 
Permanent residence at Yale for the 
New York Pro Musica would mean per-
haps two to three years of the ensemble 
being based at Yale, spending half the year 
at Yale and half the year touring. The Pro 
Musica's duties here would be as per-
formers in residence to aid in the per-
formance and teaching of performance of 
old music. They would fit into the cur-
riculum much the same way they will fit 
into it during this visit. While in residence, 
the ensemble would remain an autonom-
ous group merely housed in university 
buildings. The Pro Musica would retain 
its own trustees and funds, as well as its 
collection of one hundred twenty-five 
instruments. 
Unfortunately, there is one major 
obstacle to be overcome before the New 
York Pro Musica comes to stay-and that 
is money. The ensemble's two weeks of 
residence in October and March are being 
paid for by the university. But a perman-
ent residency for the Pro Musica may cost 
about one hundred thousand dollars a year 
and Yale at this point is unwiling to put 
that much more into the field of music.
