Slick, sentimental, 
almost camp, but good 
by Paul Goldberger 
Love Story by Erich Segal. Harper & Row, 131 pages, $4.95. 
Yes, 
Erich Segal did write Love 
Story. This business that he did not-that 
it is much too good, that no one who writes 
movies like Yellow Submarine and teaches classics at 
Yale and runs ten miles a day can possibly write a good 
novel, too-is aJI a lot of bunk, and furthermore, it begs the 
question. Segal can do almost anything, it should be evident by now, 
and it is high time his skeptics admitted it. So all right, then-the real 
question must be, is this novel the deep and profound piece of literature we 
should expect from such a diverse mind, or does it smack of the work of- dare I 
use the word?- a dilettante? No, this, too, begs the question. Love Story is slick, 
and it is obvious that Segal was having a good time when he wrote it (the fre-
quency with which Yale personalities pop up as minor characters proves that). But 
this isn't what matters. For despite its slickness, despite its predictable plot, Love 
Story is a very good novel. 

There is really no reason why it should be so good. Not only is it too smooth, it is 
so sentimental it is almost camp. The story is simple: Oliver Barrett IV, rich, 
WASP-y Harvard jock, meets Jennifer Cavilleri of Radcliffe, a poor "American of 
Italian descent and a music major." They fall in love, marry despite the opposition 
of his parents, and live happily until tragedy occurs. There is no mention of drugs, 
and the sex is implied, not detailed. Surely no self-respecting Y alie would be 
caught dead reading something so ridiculous. 

Why, then, with every reason in the world for it not to, does Love Story so nearly 
perfectly succeed? First, it is a splendidly written story. Segal writes in that rare 
style distinguished by nothing unusual at all: it is not too terse and journalistic, 
neither is it too flowery and embellished. The only proper word for it is grace-
ful. Every word, every phrase, is in its perfect place, distinctive but not such a 
bon mot as to detract from the effect of the whole. I found myself (to my 
astonishment) wondering whether I should want to change so much as a 
word. Love Story, like the film The Graduate, belongs to that small class of 
works that are not of great scope or great significance, but are special 
simply because they have nothing wrong with them. 

Good construction alone does not a novel make, of course, but there is 
more to Love Story. Segal has a remarkable way with characters-not 
for creating them, for they are almost laughably stereotyped, but for 
making them transcend their pre-cast identities and emerge as sem-
blances of real people. How odd this, too, is after years of reading 
novels that spend a hundred pages analyzing a character's hang-
nail and at the end of it all say no more {if not much less) than 
Segal does in his sparse, scattered pages of description. As 
with the sketch whose few lines are so well placed as to 
make the eye fill in the depth exactly as the artist 
wishes, one feels here as though he knows Segal's 
characters much more than he has any right to. It 
is perhaps a bit easier for the reader on a col-
lege campus, for he can fill in the gaps with 
people he knows to create his own 
image of the snotty-but-wonderful 
Radcliffe girl and the Harvard 
jock who is too good to be 
what he is. And Segal also 
cheats somewhat, as he 
deftly selects scenes 
that will allow 
some - just

tory 
traits to appear in his charac-
ters to give the illusion of greater depth. 

But the effect is still there, and the ultimate 
portrayal is so good that it takes almost a conscious 
effort not to care deeply about the characters, and even more 
of an effort (for Cambridge is not so far away!) not to identify 
with them. 

It is not impossible that there is a large audience for whom this book will 
fail miserably. Businessmen, the most academic of our scholars, and the most 
liberated of our women are not likely to enjoy it. But it has been loved by 
matrons (it was just excerpted in Ladies Home Journal, perhaps making Segal the 
first Yale professor to have written for both that publication and Yale Classical 
Studies), for the book's unabashed sentimentality was enough to win that group. 
College students make strange bedfellows for Ladies Home Journal readers, but 
there are still reasons why they are reading the same book at Yale- reasons that go 
beyond its graceful execution. Segal has perceived that the revolution we aU talk of 
being in the midst of is in a large part a romantic one, a movement not so much 
forward as backward, away from technology and organization and towards nature 
and people. The most radical fringes can be called exceptions, but the moderate 
dabblers in the youth culture have surely adopted many romantic characteristics. 

What Segal has done, in effect, is to play upon these romantic tendencies by 
taking them one step further into the realm of sentimentality. Love Story is a 
trick, a joke, a pun on those among us to whom an alliance with the forty-ish 
matron set would be anathema. Segal has tricked us into reading a novel about 
youth today that has little sex, no drugs, and a tear-jerking ending; and worse, he 
has made us Jove it, ponder it, and feel it to be completely contemporary. We 
are, deep down, no better than the sentimental slobs who sit under the hair-
dryers every Friday afternoon. It's all the same underneath. Segal has our 
number. 

But, ho-before we take up arms against this man who dares to tell us 
we are not so very different- SegaJ is not hinting at a coalition 
between the readers of Ladies Home Journal and Rolling Stone. That 
isn't where it's at, and even if it were, it wouldn't matter. For what 
is important is not that Oliver and Jenny span time (in some ways 
they do not, and are very much of the 1960's) but that we, in 
the role of readers, are not so different from those who have 
gone before. It is good to know that there is still room for a 
warm and tender story; too often all of us-revolutionists 
and reactionaries alike- get so caught up in the cynicism of 
the age that we lose the desire, the wonderful 
old-fashioned desire, to delve into a joyful piece of 
literature, to love its characters, to enjoy it for the 
mere sake of its own excellence. Such a book is 
Love Story; it is warm and eloquent, and for 
this it is wonderful, nothing more. If we 
are unable to appreciate this, how far 
have we really come? Oliver 
Goldsmith once noted, "They 
liked the book the better the 
more it made them cry," 
and, cynical though this 
observation may have 
been, its impli-
cations are not 
really so 
awful at 
all. â€¢
