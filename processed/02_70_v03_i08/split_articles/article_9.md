**Yale's Commitment to Teacher Training**

Mr. Lindley felt that whatever 
the plan they carne up with, it would not 
be a commitment to teacher training. 
Although he views the members of the 
committee as "well-meaning" he sees their 
function only as providing undergraduates 
enough of what they're pressuring for, in 
this case an access to a teaching career, 
rather than in making a positive statement 
of what the university should be doing 
to meet the need of training teachers. 
The program's director, Edward Gordon, 
did much to summarize the question of 
Yale's commitment to secondary education 
in light of the cancellation of the MAT 
program in a statement to the graduate 
faculty when the cancellation was decided 
upon. 
''Though our program has been small, it 
has been influential. Eighty-five percent 
of our graduates since 1951 have remained 
in some form of education. They are 
becoming important in developing cur-
ricula, writing textbooks, and running 
schools. 
· 
"Our program has been imitated all over 
the country. If Yale says now that it is 
unimportant, it will be making a statement 
of public policy that I disagree with. 
"The training of undergraduates as 
teachers may be equally important; we 
have now sixty signed up in our current 
undergraduate teacher training program. 
It does, however, seem to me that to 
concentrate only on the graduates of one 
college is far less professional. 
"As you know, the work of a relatively 
few, well-educated teachers in secondary 
schools is ultimately useful to colleges 
and graduate schools. The MAT program 
has produced teachers who know what 
good college and graduate education is. 
They, in turn, are more likely to take to the 
schools the standards that wiU stimulate 
the best in their students. They will also 
recommend colleges to their students. 
"The MAT program has never pretend-
ed to be adequate as Yale's commitment 
to public education. There should indeed 
be programs in research and adminis-
tration, but they will be futile if there is not 
a greater supply of intelligent teachers in 
the classrooms. The central fact of educa-
tion, as well you know, is what happens 
between the teacher, the student and 
the idea." •
