EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Friday night, colorless New Haven, down Grove
Street, past the booming presses of the New Haven
Fishwrapper and Evening News, right turn at the
indifferent blacked-out neon ARENA in front of crusty,
uggy and begrimed warehouse that has the aura of a
cigar snuffed out in a cold egg yoke. Inside the empty
hole strong arenaroma takes over: dirty socks, coughs
and wino wet dreams. Unpainted, weary uncom-
fortable benches, grey concrete walls with forgotten
aisle numerals. Cold and quiet, defaced and bored,
one expects hobnailed storm troopers, but the arena
provides only derelict, ne'er-do-well, maroon-coated
mumbling ticket takers who begin taking tickets as
soon as the bovine cigar-drowning manager of noth·
ing tells them what a shit town New Haven is com·
pared to Springfield and Waterbury where there
are more seats and fans so he can charge the same
amount but make more profit.


All that is needed for a complete continuance of
any Northeast industrial semi-pro shit city are black
hunks of perma-ice by the aisles, because the crowd
is street ugly and familiar. The Army field-jacket-
ed psychedelic contingent from Kreski's with wimpy
see-through mustaches and sideburns walk with
hands in pockets casually checking out other field-
jacketed would-be freaks checking them out. Some
have dates, semi-skirted with cotton candy hair done
in a rat' s-ass. Sticky hair to go with sticky faces that
you see on all the women. Sorry son, you'll never
see your mother's face again, we just couldn't blast
through this time. That Max Factor's the toughest
sonofabitch I've seen. Everyone's face is done in
casual paste. The fattest, unhealthiest crowd in the
world.


Dull brown and green overcoats, suits and sweaters.
If you give the crowd a blurred scan, the impression
is porridge with brown sugar; hold the milk.


In the center of the arena is a radial striped, banked
oval track, with a masonite surface screwed to drilled
angle plates, giving the impression of a giant erec-
tor project. Carniv.l ride flimsy, it is a silent prop
rather than the launching pad for ten roller skaters.
A guard rail surrounds the track, well-padded, but
cheapened w ith orange and black crepe paper.
Fifteen folding chairs stare at each other from two
lines in the infield, and two penalty boxes, also orange
and black, sigh patiently behind them.


The skaters sit alone, quietly talking, laughing,
smoking. The girls are fine specimens 11nd smile
brightly when signing autogr11phs. As the arena fills,
they file to the dressing rooms, lugging sea bags,
w•ving at the crowd.


As the aren;~ fills, the announcer apologizes for
the delay uused by the wrong starting time being an·
nounced in the papers. But no one seems to mind,
there's plenty of beer and anticipation, especially on
the part of slumming Yalies, heavily armed with over-
dressed dates ;~nd high camp consciousness.


Finally the announcer presents, for pre-game warm
ups, ''THE NORTHEAST BRAVES." Oh boy. From op·
posite sides of the arena come eight men and eight
women we;~ ring green tights with yellow side stripes,
dull silver trunks and jerseys with yellow numerals.
The men h<~ve black skate shoes, the women white,
knee pads for ;~II . The uniforms are well worn, torn,
thin, faded, ;~nd wrinkled. Applause is non-existent,
only scattered boos. Round and round the track go
the mighty braves, some slowly, all indifferently,
others racing and weaving, banking and coasting,
stopping to slap a teammate on the ass, occasionally
waving to the crowd. loosening up, but sloppily
ragged and unfriendly.


All the women have short hair and bulging leg
muscles. Their mouths open and shut, open and shut,
CHew, CHew, CHew, CHewing gum. Every girl. All
the time. The faster they skate, the faster they chew
in open mouth staggered precision.


After a few minutes, the crowd is restless again, a
bit unsure <~bout the upcoming entertainment. Finally,
the Braves crawl under the railing and return to the
dressing rooms. The aren;~'s rusty buzzer, sounding
like the fart of • rnorb;~ck hawg, sounds. The ;~n­
nouncer p<~uses, then: " LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY BOMBERS."


Hoot, holler, the arena comes alive with an affec·
tionately orgasmic leap to the feat. Whistle stomp
point clap scream and smile. The Bombers are really
back. In comes the Orange and Black brightly cos·
tumed team, swarming onto the track with natural
enthusiasm and confidence. Bright smiles on all the
skaters, fresh, sunny uniforms. "The girls and the
boys are particularly concerned with keeping clean,"
captain Margie lazlo had said, and you bet your
boots she was truthin'. Ah, the confidence was oozing
from their skates, and New Haven hadn't seen any·
thing so new and professional in many years.


Round and round, faster, crisper, into serpentines
and frisky practice blocking. Smiling and shouting to
each other, Charlie O'Connell seeing an old friend
in the crowd, comes over and ch;~ts for a while. So
inform• I that local heroes can-talk to local hero wor·
shippers, and the Bombers have the worshippers.


A huddle and pep talk, break with a clap and the
final w•rm up begins, a super fut serpentine, all
thirteen teammates close quarter, nose to ass, once,
twice, three times around counterclockwise ending
with a full length hip slip side scrape spread eagle
for one of the girls.


Back come the Braves to much more enthusiastic
booing as the crowd is up and itching for action during
the National Anthem. The first period begins, and
watch out, for the next ninety-six minutes, 'cause it's
jungle ball on skates and masonite, body contact and
gorilla theatre as the jammers, two out of the five on
a team, try to lap the pack and receive points for
every enemy skater passed.


Everything seems to be legal, and "JAM TIME"
brings shrieks from the crowd anticipating ninety
seconds of asses and elbows.


The two to watch are Margie Lazlo, number thirty·
nine of the Bombers, and Cathie Read, twenty-eight of
the Braves. Sweet Margie, 5' 9", twenty-seven years
old, with dark h;~ ir tied in a pony tail, handsome
and seductive like June Carter, with high cheekbones
and bright eyes, unmarried, soft on the outside. But
a finger-breakin' bone-stomp in' hot shot skatin' super-
star whose innocent charm vanishes as Read shoves
a Bomber over the rail, then leaps on Lazlo's back
and pounds and tears. It's happenin'. Lazlo frantically
kicks and slugs, bumps and swears, giving elbows
to the ribs and chest of Read, who is a low class loud·
mouth lucille Ball cachinating loser. Read is placed
in the penalty box and the next time around lazlo
knocks it over, Read with-in it. Read streaks to lazlo
who side steps and pushes her into the fattest referee
in the world and skates away laughing.


Lazlo pounds Rosetta Saunders with three knock-
downs. Her elbows are all over the track. Three
minutes into the third period, Sandy Dunn of the
Braves neck-bashes a Bomber into a guard rail and
rabbit punches the neck. No penalty, but Lazlo comes
around and windmills fists into her face, knocking
her down, and Lazlo skates away satisfied. Round
and round. Elbows, knees, spread eagle back slides,
guard rail flip overs, tripping, kicking, "Lazlo, I'm
gonna tear your eyes out. Get me outta this goddam
penalty boxllll"


Round the corner, blood and passion in their eyes,
knocking, clubbing, oh my god what would they be
like in bed. Carolyn Morehead, thirty-six for the
Bombers, blond and smiling, spread eagled, angry
and pained, she belongs on a commune. Just what is
SHE doin' here? Those almost revealing uniforms.
Don't give me this dike shit. Those are real women.
I love you Bombers.


The men's alternate periods at first seem anti-
climatic, but the pure excellence of their skating abil-
ity commands attention. The Downhill Racer moves,
gravity defiance, G-forces grinding on turns,
sharp pivots, screeching turns on overcrowded track,
weaving in and out behind the pack, looking for the
hole, dig in and accelerate. Off balance knee bend
spread eagle, but make it up and keep skating. Tony
Roman, Bombers thirty-seven squatting between
Braves' legs for points, then obnoxiously skating
around infield, making faces at Braves and the ref-
erees, a Mickey Rooney smart ass showoff, but the
best skater on the track. If he's bitten off a bit too
much, he stands wimpering behind the only skater
alive who can wither the pack with one glance-
CHARLIE O'CONNELL.


Brought out of retirement last year, big number
forty takes no truck from any skater. Fifty thousand
dollars worth of pig iron, Charlie is Babe Ruth,
Duke Kahanamoko, Casey Stengel, Don Schollander
and Jean-Claude Killy. O'Connell's the name but he
looks like a cross between John Wayne and
Broderick Crawford.


No one gets by the massive hulk of Charlie
O'Connell. Silent player-coach Charlie, roaming the
oval like the biggest meanest mountain cat, knocking
Woodberry of the Braves over the rail into the stands
and standing proudly, impassively, as the world
considers a broken neck. O'Connell swooping up and
pulverizing a just-fallen jammer with his skates. No
one but Charlie has four double knock downs in
ONE JAM TIME. He drifts along the oval like a run-
away box car, try to pass him for the point and
POOM in the rib, Kooof, into the shoulder, pound,
pelt, pulverize, maim. Charlie O'Connell bruises
bodies. Go Charlie. The crowd cannot believe his
wonderfulness.


The men continue skating, spinning around, off
balance and into the rail, leaping back and into the
pack with delicate control, helmets and fists flying,
jaws chawing, faster, faster, Shattuck of Braves stomp-
ing on Selesta's stomach, kneeing his neck, skates to
the ribs.


Round and round, close quarters, trip, slide, bump,
mash, kick, stomp, elbow. Finally, with a close-quarter
weaving reverse spiral last minute effort, Roman and
O'Connell, Mutt and Jeff, fail to score, as the Braves
sneak away thirty-nine to thirty-six, as the Truth or
Consequences buzzer ends the match.


The crowd leaves, with shaking heads, half the
lights are d immed. Several of the skaters return
quickly for a two-hour bit by bit dis-assembling of
the track. Tomorrow they skate at two P.M. in Prov-
idence, the next day in Boston. Unload the truck,
set the track up, take it down, load the truck, skate in
between. Get drunk at night. Drive to Boston, down
to Charlottesville, over to Omaha, Chicago. Set up,
skate, take it down.


Good-bye Charlie. Good-bye sweet Carolyn and
Margie. Good luck to you all. •
