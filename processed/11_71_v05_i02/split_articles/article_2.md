Summer in South Africa 
Sport, particularly rugby, is a way of 
life for most South Africans; this has 
been the one sphere (besides heart 
transplants) in which South Africa has 
been able to maintain preeminence. I 
returned to South Africa this summer, 
after three years in America. On Sat-
urday mornings we would cluster 
around our radios (there is no tele-
vision) and listen to reports of riot-
. torn rugby matches in Australia. "Our 
boys" were subjected to physical at-
tacks. smoke bomb assaults, and chant-
ing anti-apartheid demonstrators. Clearly, 
much had happened to South Af-
rica in my absence. 


It became apparent over the two 
months I stayed there that startling 
changes were taking place in a society 
where change occurs very slowly, if at 
all. Tremendous political turmoil ap-
peared as groups re-defined themselves 
or broke away from more traditional 
groups. This is a traumatic time for 
South Africa, where the role of the 
Afrikaner has always been rigidly de-
fined: where a complex political struc-
ture has been built up to fulfill what 
the Afrikaner saw as his divine mission 
in Africa; and where race attitudes have 
become innexible and hardened over 
cent~ries of bitter connict and struggle. 
Thousands of black and white South 
Africans had either been exiled or had 
exiled themselves from a society which 
since 1948 (when the present Dutch-
descended Afrikaner government came 
to power} had become progressively re-
pressive and anti-democratic. Having 
left in frustration and disillusionment, 
they could hardly have foreseen the 
present developments: the splitting 
open of a previously closed political 
system. 


Certainly I could predict little change 
when I left South Africa over three 
years ago on the wave of the fust signi-
ficant student protest in twenty years 
of National Party rule. A I 0-day sit-in 
at the University of Cape Town over the 
government's blocking of a black faculty 
appointment had provoked outspoken 
and vicious reactions from the prime 
minister and a variety of cabinet minis-
ters. More importantly, it had generated 
larger-than-usual marches and demon-
strations at other student centers in 
Johannesburg and Durban. 


Despite government intimidation of 
students who were sitting-in (removal 
of parents from jobs, withdrawal of pass-
ports, denial of scholarships, detention, 
and even, in some cases, imprisonment), 
it was not the government or its police 
which had ended the action. Only when 
faced with a thousand hostile Afrikaner 
university students bent on evicting us 
violently from the building did we evacu-
ate. 


Anyone opposed to apartheid must 
first come to terms with the Afrikaner's 
profound sense of his uniqueness. The 
Afrikaner's historical mission is clear. 
Hendrik Verwoerd, Prime Minister of 
South Africa until he was assassinated 
in 1966, described it in these terms: 
"It was intended that we should have 
been planted here at the southern point 
within the crisis area of western civiliza-
tion so that from this resistance group 
might emanate the victory whereby all 
that has been built up since the days of 
Christ may be maintained for the good of 
all mankind." 


Because of his supposed uniqueness, 
the Afrikaner believed that he was right, 
whatever criticisms came from the "out-
side world." His moral righteousness 
resulted in a crude nationalism which 
made apartheid its slogan and racial 
superiority its foundation. By 1970 the 
ideology had managed to fashion a pow-
erful state machine, repressive and coer-
cive in the extreme, with a bureaucratic 
structure having control over all aspects 
of the society. 


Apartheid became ''separate develop-
ment," which envisaged a number of 
black nations, called "homelands," in-
dependent of the white nation. Both 
blacks and whites would then retain 
their geographical, historical, and cultur-
al integrity. 


''As long as domination of one race 
by another exists there will be resist-
ance and unrest," argued Verwoerd. 
"The solution should be sought in a 
policy which is calculated te eliminate 
domination in every form." The policy 
made no allowance for the facts that 
the blacks. about 80 per cent of the 
population. would receive 13 per cent 
of the land. and that increasing economic 
integration in the urban areas makes 
whites vitally dependent on cheap 
black labor.
