"Good therapy" in a "cowardly whorehouse" 
John Arlow 
Perhaps the stifled souls of New York find in it 
some kind of unholy sanctuary. Walter Kerr, for in-
stance, calls it good therapy (though Stanley Kauffman, 
demurring, says It's a "cowardly whorehouse." It is 
The James Joyce Memorial Liquid Theatre, is current-
ly at New York's Guggenheim Museum and defmes it-
self as, "an alternative to the cold, harsh urban envir-
onment." Certainly this is nothing to be sneezed at. 
The price of admission, which is comparatively stiff, 
entitles you first of all to a nylon laundry bag. Into this, 
you place the shoes, wallets, watches, and other cum-
bersome tokens (not, however, your clothes) of the 
ordered, worldly realms to be left behind. 

You recline in an inflatable armchair, your feet dug 
into fake-fur bath mat, while the company creeps about, 
mimicking exotic bird calls. 

A young actress bends over and whispers in your 
ear, ("We're ready for the green bag people" ) and you 
move, with a dozen other members o t the audience, to 
an alcove bathed in light-bulb p\nk. 

''We're going to play a few sensitivity games to get 
to know one another," says the group leader, producing 
a beach ball. What follows is a series of acting warm-ups, 
of the type codified by Viola Spolin, subsequently stol-
en by group therapists, and eroticised by the Esalen 
Institute. In one game, the ball is passed around the 
circle, and starting with the letter "a" each individual 
thinks of a word beginning with the letter that falls to 
him. At first, this results in General Electric College 
Bowl tension, but the answers soon become spontan-
eous and stunningly unpredictable - the Le Drugstore 
hippy with forty dollar velvet jeans from Blooming-
dales gets the letter "1" and says " love," and the guy 
who's just come in from San Francisco to rig a light-
show surprises everyone with his remarkable associa-
tion for the letter "f." 

"We've just been told that they're ready for the 
people with green bags," the leader announces, and you 
are herded down to the basement theatre lounge where 
you check your laundry bags. Tea is next - half a cup 
(they're going to move you out in a few seconds) 
and again you wait on plastic blow-up chairs, relax-
ing in polyester luxury and imagining the sensual de-
lights ahead .... The Maze is next. 

I had gotten my complimentary tickets and the back-
ground story on the Liquid Theatre earlier in the day 
from an actress in the company who had gone to drama 
school with my companion a few years before. When 
she greeted us at the door, she was all smiley and zaftig-
bouncy. overjoyed to see someone from the stable past. 
(Actors have to be mobile to keep up with the rapidly-
changing trends these days; they tend to lose their 
roots.) 

The Liquid Theatre evolved in a similiar atmosphere 
of instability. When its parent repertory company had 
director problems and found itself without a play to 
present for a scheduled, opening date in mid-season, the 
group threw together a minstrel show - very hip and 
cool and with-it - which bombed. It bombed, the com-
pany decided, because the audience was not ... warmed-
up for the experience. To remedy this, the actors began 
the performance by playing theatre games with the 
$9.25 plus the agenbite of i'nwit 
spectators, and the result was overwhelming. The min-
strel show was dropped, the concept grew, and Liquid 
Theatre became the hottest ticket in Southern Califor-
nia. 

" Husbands and wives came to abandon each other 
and find someone else," the girl said, laughing ruefully. 
" We were sold out weeks in advance." A producer be-
came interested in the group and brought them to New 
York fo r a trial period. A score of dancers was hired 
and trained to accommodate the anticipated crowds. 
This, of course, is only a beginning. If success is forth-
coming, the Liquid Theatre format will be franchised. 
like MacDonalds' hamburgers, across the country. 
That's when the money will come in. In the mean-
time. the performers are getting room and board and 
something like five dollars a day. " It mounts up." the 
actress said ··or course I'd rather be using my training 
for legit shows or movies. but in the interim ... " 

"But how do you feel about touching all these 
strangers every night?'' my friend asked. 

"Oh. it's all right, it's really not that bad. Once in 
a while I get a few grabbers." 

Well. I'll be good, I thought, as I waited in my in-
flatable chair before entering the maze, I'll be good and 
try not to grab anybody. 

The empty teacups were collected. and one by o ne the 
audience was led out of the waiting room. A tall young 
man who looked as if he'd just walked off the chorus 
line of Applause took my hands and hissed. "Clowse 
yer eyes and trussst me!" 

And so it begins. There's no denying that it's fun. 
As you move from hand to hand in the eyelid darkness, 
the actors snuggle up to you, waft incense toward your 
nose. stuff grapes into your mouth. hum into your ears, 
draw lace across your face. and rock you in a cradle of 
what Abbie Hoffman calJs "cuddly humanity." When 
you're told to open your eyes. you've got your arms 
around two Zefferelli children who say in unison. 
"You are now entering Magic Land. Make it whatever 
you want it to be." 

In Magic Land· the theatre games get more intimate. 
like find a partner. have him (or her) close his (or her) 
eyes and lead him (or her) around the room. Get your 
partner to touch things. the beard on that fat actor 
· 
freak who's dressed in a velour monk's robe. or the 
fabric of the double-knit jacket that poor Dr. Rosen is 
wearing as he stands, alienated and disgusted. in an 
empty corner with his wife. 

This is all very entertaining (although I did hear some 
crassly materialistic people object to the S9.25 ticket 
price). but by this time many members of the audience 
have had their sensory circuits so overloaded that they 
want just to sit down and talk. Many people improvise 
their own games. of the sort that were seen in the box 
scats of the Italian Opera in Balzac's time and may still 
be observed today at college mixers. The actors en-
courage the audience in this activity; get to know each 
other. they say. 

But wait a minute. Actors? Audience? Certainly 
this isn't radical theater talk? We know. after all. that 
These Divisions Must Cease To Exist Since We Are All 
Creating A Group Environmental Experience Together. 


Maybe it's that the Liquid Theatre wants to· show its 
independence from any rigid theory, because the next 
thing that happens is that the audience is seated on the 
floor while the actors put on a dumb-show. 

In this mime, the players metamorphose into ani-
mals that perhaps were left out in the rain when Noah 
Sills took his Story Theatre ark to Broadway. The 
beasts create an apocalyptic situation; a solemn moment 
of silence follows, and then comes a reconstruction of 
the cosmos in the form of a sort of Adam and Eve 
couple. Adam and Eve realize profound truths about 
each other along the lines of "oh-you 've-got-two-of 
tlwse-and-l've-got-one-ofthese, "and then a band ap-. 
pears and everybody is pulled up for a fertility dance 
cum-hora. I got a silly notion at this point that I had 
fallen into a concentration camp for New York intel-
lectuals, and that the showers would be our next man-
datory activity. 

But I was wrong. More theatre games are played, a 
few Hindu mantras are chanted, and then a second set 
of dancing ends the two-and-a-half hour performance. 
I smiled at one of the actresses as she handed me 
my bag. and she smiled at me. Thank you for flying 
with us. Have a good day: and do come again. With 
another show to do that evening, she really couldn't 
stop to talk. I slipped on my shoes and walked to the 
exit. There was. I realized, something sour about Liquid 
Theatre. 

Ordinary theatre depends on a shared set of pre-
tenses between actors and audience. We know that what 
we watch isn't real, but we agree to accept it, for a 
time, as reality. The Liquid Theatre pretends to give 
us more, to engage us directly and deeply. The ·result 
is that when the illusion is dropped, as in the end it in-
evitably must be, we feel betrayed, mocked, and made 
fools of, because we have had the trust we willingly 
give to the theater cruely abused. 

There is nothing necessarily wrong with radical 
theatre. Dionysus in '69, a few seasons back, was a play 
about the loss of-emotional control that worked a 
similar loss of actor-audience distance into the story 
line with devastating power. 

But The James Joyce Memorial Liquid Theatre has 
no such unity or purpose. It has nothing to do with 
James Joyce either, except, perhaps, that one feels the 
agenbite of inwit for having attended.
