Hard times at the copy desk of New York's Picture Newspaper 
The desk is large and U-shaped, suitable 
for answering telethon calls, maybe, or 
for assembling bomb-sights. You and 
your co-workers take your seats around 
the outer rim at two o'clock in the afternoon. You wait. The action dribbles in 
at first, and then, for the next six or 
seven hours it overwhelms you. Fidgeting like delinquent children in the principal's office, you play a difficult, nit-picking game,concerned largely with 
out-witting libel lawyers. It's called 
copyreading. 

A hawk-faced man called Chilly sits 
above you and broods or barks orders 
like a foreman in a steel mill. He hands 
you a story marked for a No.5 headline; 
three lines of twelve counts each, and â€¢ 
you pounce on it greedily_ You think and 
then write slowly: "Mines Bureau/ Held 
Negligent/ In Fatal Blast. "You begin a 
second story and Chilly interrupts; his 
head for the mines story goes this way: 
"House Probe/ Hits Mines Unit/ In Fatal 
Blast... " There's plenty of room, he explains, to add the fact that a House subcommittee is doing the charging. Your 
next head (police, acting on tips, arrest 
three for selling drugs) reads: "Tips Help 
Nip/ 3 Drug Dealers. " Chilly stops; yes, 
cold. Anyone who's seen a 1930's newspaper movie knows you don't convict 
people before their trial. He changes the 
bottom line to "3 on Drug Rap. " 

Such is the work at the copy desk of 
New York's Picture Paper, and from the 
men who work there come some of the 
shortest, most splendid flights of fancy 
any newspaper anywhere serves up for 
its readers. 

It isn't a glamorous job. Certainly if 
you learned your journalism at the Yale 
Daily, you 'II be happier tracking down 
the latest wrinkle in women's lib for 
Time-Life, or stalking the ghetto schools 
with The Times' Joseph Lelyveld. But 
if you've spent say, two years as a copy 
boy and another six nursing your beer 
belly and sharpening your eye at the 
Paterson Call, you can reach your 
apotheosis at the dirty steel desk in one 
corner of The Daily News' vast and untidy seventh floor city room. Such men 
can glance down a column of close gray 
type and spot a mis-placed comma as 
surely as if it were printed in fluorescent 
green. 

Copyreading is a curious kind of backwater skill. Eternally in demand, it rarely commands much respect even from 
the people who practice it. "It's a dirty 
goddamn business," one of the temporary readers at the News told me, "and 
if I had a kid who went to Yale and 
wanted to go into it I'd put his head 
against a wall and beat some goddamn 
sense into him. " 

Of the million decisions made each 
day at a daily paper, the copy desk 
makes the 900,000 least significant 
ones. If the day's story is about air pollution, the city desk decides how it 
should be covered, the reporter arranges 
the facts and puts them into words, the 
news desk decides how much play to 
give the story, and the copy desk decides 
whether to use an "f" or a "ph" in 
"sulfur dioxide." With the exception of 
business and sports news, the copy desk 
has the final say on every word that runs 
in the paper, from the lead story on down 
to the pollution "airdex." 

Copyreaders are there because reporters are largely incapable of exercising critical judgement about their own 
work. They can't spell, either. Give a 
reporter free rein and nine times out of 
ten he'll write something like: "The 
sharp increase in crimes of violence was 
attributed to an increase in drug abuse 
by top police officials." A copyreader 
must catch something like that, because 
its next stop is the composing room, 
where it gets cast in hot lead, plated 
onto a thick sheet of spongy cardboard 
and sent forth, two million strong, to 
show up a month later at the bottom of 
a column in The New Yorker. 

Then there are the technical rules 
of style, like when to capitalize "boy 
scout" and whether to abbreviate 
"East" or "west" in street addresses. 
The important thing isn't necessarily 
to conform to common sense, which 
usually has nothing to say about whether 
"Mr. Smith" (Times style) or just 
"Smith" (News style) in second reference is the preferred usage: The important thing is to be consistent, even consistent in absurdity. The cumulative effect of doing it differently every time is 
unsettling to readers ... one of the unheralded reasons that you always feel 
you've skipped a paragraph when you 
read a story in The Post. 

The News runs a shirt-sleeved kind 
of desk, full of real newspaper machismo, 
where one's proudest boast is that he's 
a "working stiff," and the competition 
for overtime is now and then fierce. 
These heavyset guys from Staten Island 
and Flushing know more about the English language than any of those book 
editors from Amherst having lunch at 
the Italian Pavilion, no question, but 
when Chilly sends the self-respecting 
News copy-reader off for lunch at six 
o'clock in the evening, he heads for a 
corned beef sandwich and three beers 
at the Louis East bar, on Second Avenue 
and 41st street. Nor does anyone on the 
desk talk about how much more fun it 
must be to interview Joseph Gallo than 
to copper-rivet an "alleged" to every 
phrase that crops up in apposition to 
his name in the resulting story. Still, 
there are some signs that the readers 
now and again question whether the rewards of the job, including salaries that 
reach into the mid teens or higher, really 
make it worth it. One sign is the extremely high turnover rate. Because people are 
constantly leaving for a better deal and 
because it takes The News longer to hire 
a single $300-a-week copyreader than 
it takes the average college to select a 
president, half the people on the desk on 
a given Saturday will be temporaries, 
moonlighting from their regular jobs or 
picking up a few odd dollars between 
jobs. For a newspaper, a notoriously insensitive category of employer, The 
News seems curiously aware of the need 
to compensate copyreaders for the 
anonymity and frustrations of their 
work: by putting their names in two-inch high letters on the backs of their 
chairs, for instance ... a distinction 
denied reporters. More concretely, every 
week some $75 gets divided among the 
authors of the six or seven best headlines of the week, and a good copyreader can make a steady fifteen or 
twenty dollars that way. 

Headline writing is what The News 
pays you for, really. If you don't read 
The News much you possibly have the 
idea that it's just like The Post, with its 
"$$"whenever it can't fit "Money" onto 
a line and its irritating habit of using 
"OK'd" when something is approved 
and "KO'd" when it's voted down. But 
The News is sui generis in headlines. 
Test yourself. Write a three-line, one-column head (twelve characters and 
spaces per line) for a story about a 
girl who felt sorry for the inmates of 
a northern Italian jail and rented a room 
across the street to perform a striptease for them. Assuming you don't 
break any of the basic rules of copyreading, you might have come up with 
something like: "Girl Strips/ For Prisoners/ In N. Italy. "This is a competent 
headline, and if The Times ran the story 
at all it was probably underneath something bland like that. The News had a 
transcendent headline that day; it read: 
"She Offers/ Cons Tease/ & Sympathy," 
or a story about a jump in beef prices 
(this is a News classic): "Prices Soar, 
Buyers Sore/ Cow Jumps Over the 
Moon. "An oil slick threatens Coney 
Island? "Bad Tidings Drift Up For N.Y. 
Bathers," A girl is born after a record 
13-month pregnancy? "She Was A 
Baby in Waiting. "Of course. 

The News takes intense and personal 
pride in it all. "We do some fantastic 
things with heads," modestly admits day 
slotman Chilly Allan, He's called a slotman because he sits in the middle of the 
"U", in the slot between the two arms. 
No one seems to know why he's called 
Chilly, but the name is appropriate 
enough ... he's been a newspaperman (no 
one at The News thinks of himself as a 
"journalist") for 40 years or so, and 
he's skinny and sardonic like David 
Brinkley left out in the sun too long. 

Chilly is one of the top men in the 
country in his particular job, which on a 
brisk day demands the powers of concentration ordinarily required only of 
astronauts docking in space. He rereads 
every piece of copy that crosses the 
desk, every head written there gets 
checked by him for style, appropriateness and length, and many of those he 
doesn't like he re-writes himself. 

The routine at the copy desk varies 
little from day to day. The first hour is 
slow, maybe Chilly flips an early proof 
of the editorial page at you to check and 
that's all you do for a while. If you're 
new you may question the self-conscious capital letters in references to 
Eastern Europe (which News editorials 
solemnly refer to as "Captive Nations") 
but that particular battle between the 
desk and the editorial writers has been 
fought out long ago, and Chilly says to let 
it go that way. It's helpful at times like 
that to consider that the news staff is 
usually in a kind of guerilla dialectic 
with management anyhow. Late in June 
someone tacked to a city room wall 
copies of a News editorial as it appeared 
in the first edition and as it ran in subsequent editions around the time of the 
Pentagon papers. The original version 
read, in part: "The Times decided it had 
a professional duty to publish large 
wads of the stuff; a decision on which we 
do not see how The Times can be faulted. In a free country, a newspaper is 
supposed to act like a newspaper." In 
later editions, it was changed to read 
simply: "The Times decided it had a 
professional duty to publish large wads 
of the stuff, apparently in the belief that 
it did not threaten the security of our 
country or endanger the life of any 
soldier." Above this someone had scrawled: "We believe the phrase is: 100% 
chicken shit." 

Chilly pushes across a handful of 
short stories torn from the UPI wires 
and marked for the "In The Nation" 
or "In The World" sections. Actually 
they were long stories when they came 
over the wires, and tomorrow's Times 
quite probably will give each of them a 
full column on an inside page. But at 
New York's Picture Newspaper the telegraph desk clips and pastes together 
three or four sentences and runs them 
into one long paragraph. They're a 
nuisance because the copy comes off 
the UPI wire all in caps and you've got 
to mark where you really want the 
composing room to use upper case 
letters. The News' style book, which 
should guide you on this, is no help 
at all: one of the slimmest in the business, it devotes half a page to an admonition not to use "pretty" in a picture 
caption unless the subject really is pretty (" 'Comely, attractive' will often serve 
the purpose ... "), but the information 
that's really important for copyreaders 
to have, like whether to capitalize 
"post office" in second references, or 
which Oriental names have the surname 
first, is left to the reader's imagination. 
Fortunately, Chilly makes it his business 
to keep all these rules in his head.
