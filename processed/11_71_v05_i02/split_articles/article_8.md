Near the end of the first act of Ibsen's 
When We Dead A waken, Rubek, the 
sculptor-hero, says to Irene, his former 
model and inspiration, "There is something hidden behind everything you say." 
He is calling her a mystic or a symbolist 
at best, and we might complain that it is 
yet another example of the artist pre-
empting the critic's role. Ibsen's play 
resounds with this sort of vague and 
final sounding criticism, and rightfully 
so. for it is one of that rare and difficult 
breed, the artistic creation in which the 
true artist confronts himself and his 
work. This type of work is necessarily 
self-critical. and in the case of Ibsen's 
When We Dead A waken the complexity 
is compounded by its status as a last 
play. a final work. Ibsen subtitled the 
play. "A Dramatic Epilogue," and 
though he planned to write more, he 
.-did see the drama as a summation of the 
series of plays which began with A Doll's 
House. When We Dead A waken is in the 
grand tradition of Shakespeare's ro-
rpances and Beethoven's late quartets, 
and it is equally difficult to grasp. 


In his seminal essay. "No More 
Masterpieces." Antonio Artaud wrote, 
·"If ... a contemporary public does not 
understand Oedipus Rex, I shall make 
bold to say that it is the fault of Oedi-
pus Rex and no t of the public." "No 
more masterpieces!" has since become 
the ral.ying cry of too many self-pro-
claimed disciples of Artaud, and the 
Yale Repertory Theatre, itself hardly 
insensitive to Artaud, has wisely added 
"Know more masterpieces," as well. 
Ibsen's When We Dead A waken. the 
play which opened this season at the 
Yale Rep. is unquestio"nably a master-
piece. It also will not be understood by 
the contemporary public. Yet I shall 
make bold to modify Artaud and say 
that it may be the fault of the play, 
but it is certainly its purpose as well. 


Were the questions Ibsen raises under-
standable or easily articulated, there 
would have been little point to the writ-
ing of the play and virtually none to 
performing it. 


The setting of the piece is a spa, 
which for the European imagination 
(as we know from Alain Resnais, Fred-
erico Fellini, and Thomas Mann) has 
precious little to do with health. Steve 
Rubin ·s decor is minimal, yet evocative. 
A rear wall of polished wood· panels calls 
to mind Danish modern/do-it-yourself 
sauna. Scandianvia at its most bour-
geois. A hovering parachute serves as 
umbrella. mountain, and symbol of an 
uncertain stasis. Two tables and a few 
chairs, sculpted either grotesquely or 
primitively. complete the scene. And 
in this scene, the grotesque (the artist) 
tries to come to terms with the prim-
itive {life) - or shall we say that the 
primitive artist tries one last time to 
face his grotesque life. 


Rubek, the sculptor, is old and 
famous and has returned to Norway 
after a long self-imposed exile. (The 
parallel to Ibsen himself is obvious, 
though the Yale Rep is perhaps too 
helpful in making up Rubek to look 
like the playwright.) His wife, Maia, is 
younger than he, uninterested in his 
work. and inadequate as a companion. 
At the mountain resort, Rubek meets 
Irene. the model for his greatest work. 
whom he had rejected in love and life 
and used solely for his art. Both the 
woman and the art she had inspired in 
Rubek have become corrupted since 
she left him years ago. Irene is now mad 
and is followed everywhere by a Nun 
who watches her closely in silence. 
Finally. there is Squire Ulfheim, a bear 
hunter, with "not a trace of the artist 
in him." Ulfheim attracts Maia with his 
artlessness; Rubek holds Irene with the 
memory of his art. Both couples ascend 
the mountain. one in search of fleshy 
game and fleshly pleasure, the other 
for a more spiritual fulfillment. A storm 
arises; the hunter and the young woman 
descend to safety while the artist and 
his inspiration climb higher to their 
dream and doom. 


The human situation is necessarily 
schematic, for the characters of this 
play are not characters at all, but ab-
stractions. The relationships among 
them are more like the principles, 
theories, and postulates whjch link 
ideas than the emotions which serve to 
tie human beings. All of which leads to 
the central problem of the current pro-
duction, which is the awesome task of 
finding an acting style for this problem-
atic play. When We Dead A waken reads 
well. but then so does Either/Or. In the 
Ibsen, unlike the Kierkegaard, some 
difficult philosophic and aesthetic no-
tions must be presented by human 
agents and the results, at least for this 
production by the Yale Rep, are uneven. 


Tom Haas, who has directed tlus pro-
duction, seems to have failed to exercise 
his proper and necessary directorial con-
trol. Previous productions by Haas ( Woy-
zeck, Donner. Subject to Fits) have all 
been characterized by singleness of vis-
ion. consistency of style, and most of all 
by a strong point of view toward the 
plays themselves. In Wizen We Dead A-
waken. which by its very abstract nature 
needs this input, the actors have been 
left to find their own styles by their own 
devices, and they don't seem to have 
consulted with each other. 


David Hurst is a powerful Rubek, a 
pleasure to watch and to hear. When 
he speaks of the torment of the artist, 
we can believe that he knows what he is 
saying, for as an actor Mr. Hurst is an 
artist indeed. During Act II of the play, 
Irene dismisses Rubek as a poet. Hurst 
has caught the truth of her condemna-
tion and used it in his characterization. 
Though Ibsen wrote When We Dead A-
waken in prose, the language, according 
to Michael Meyer, his biographer and 
translator. is a sort of heightened poetic 
prose. Although the language of Michael 
Feingold's new translation is not par-
ticularly heightened (it is at times 
actually quite prosaic) Hurst plays for 
as much poetry as he can get from it. 
By stressing this highly theatrical trait 
in the complex Rubek. Hurst grounds 
the abstraction "Artist'' in a dramatical-
ly and literarily recognizeable reality, 
which is nevertheless not so idiosyn-
cratic as to preclude the more abstract 
and symbolic play of ideas. He is neith-
er too specific nor too general in his 
acting; he allows us the freedom not 
to understand in a meaningful way. 


The two women. on the other hand. 
demonstrate the two directions in 
which the acting of this play can easily 
fall down, and in this case does. Nancy 
Wickwire, as Irene, has failed to deal 
with the abstract quality of the role 
she plays. In her extremes of mannered 
madness. she seems obsessed most of 
all not with art or love or life. but with 
the craft of acting. Her self-conscious 
twitching is all too reminiscent of the 
bravado performances in Peter Brook's 
production of Marat/Sade. She offers us 
a complete surface. the well-made char-
acter with motivations and explanations. 
suffering perhaps most of all from the 
fact that there is no one else on stage to 
whom she can relate. no one in her play. 
We have nothing to penetrate in her 
Irene. no distance to overcome. We un-
derstand her all too well. 


Sarah Albertson. as Maia. does not 
ground herself anywhere. While Miss 
Wickwire is too specific. Miss Albertson 
is too general. She speaks her lines as if 
they were coming from somewhere out-
side her body rather than from within. 
Almost as a marionette. she makes her-
self simply another voice in Ibsen's inter-
nal debate. and wh1le this may be intel-
lectually and interpretively correct. it 
does not play. 


Stephen Mendillo ·s Squire Ulfheim looks right but sounds wrong. Mr. 
Mendillo continues to be an extremely 
strong presence on the stage, but in 
this production he seems unsure of what 
he wants to do with his actual words. 
One is tempted to blame the director: 
some more direction would surely have 
made a great difference. Carmen de 
Lavallade is fine as the Nun, properly 
chilling and mysterious, with just the 
right amount of float to her steps. She 
and Miss Albertson, the program informs 
us. will be alternating the roles of Maia 
and the Nun. 


A word about children and animals, 
of which there are both in this pro-
duction. With few except ions, neither 
ever reach the level of true profession-
alism in acting and are usually painful 
injections of amateurism into a profes-
sional production. In this Yale Rep 
production of When We Dead A waken. 
we worry about them, and this concern 
distracts us from the play. Neither 
children nor dogs were really necessary. 
except perhaps as auxiliary props or 
as illustrations to throwaway lines. They 
could have been, more judiciously, cut 
altogether. 


While acting is the central problem 
of this production - and it is a big one 
-the Yale Repertory presentation of 
When We Dead A lvaken should not be 
dismissed or disregarded because of it. 
This is a rare opportunity to see a mast-
erpiece which is not often performed. 
The very mounting of this play is a 
laudable act in itself. and although the 
translation is not brilliant, it is also not 
castrating. Ibsen comes through, and 
the Ibsen who does will be a revelation 
to those who know him from Hedda 
Gabler. This is the Socratic Ibsen, con-
stantly questioning himself, able to do 
so at the very height of his accomplish-
ment. There is none of the brash moral 
certainty of Peer Gynt or the consid-
ered opinionating of Ghosts about 
this play. When We Dead A waken has 
no message. It simply poses the most 
fundamental questions. What does it 
mean to be a man? ... to be alive? ... 
to die? 


'·You don't really have a clear idea 
what it's like inside an artist's mind." 
says Rubek to Maia in the middle of the 
second act. She replies. ''My God. I 
don't even know what it's like inside my 
own mind." Ibsen embraces the at-
titudes of Rubek and Maia. of Irene 
and even Ulfheim. He knows his mind 
and yet he does not: it is his knowledge 
and his ignorance which he bares to us 
in When We DeaJ A waken. It is a wis-
dom which knows the foolishness of 
answers. 


.. We only see what's wrong with our 
lives." says Irene. "when we dead awaken." 
And what we see, she tells us, is that we 
were never alive. Ibsen originally con-
cluded the play with the artist and his 
former model reaching the mountain 
peak in the midst of a violent storm. He 
ch~ nged that ending to have them die in 
an avalanche. Perhaps he was hoping to 
metaphorically restore life through 
death. but the metaphorical resolution 
is lost in the attempt to transfer it to a 
reality. The play remains beautifully 
beyond understanding.
