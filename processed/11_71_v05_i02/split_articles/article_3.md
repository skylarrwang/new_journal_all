In a new "outward-looking policy," 
the new prime minister, Halthazzar 
Verster, who had been interned during 
World War II for his Nazi sympathies 
(along with many of his present cabinet) 
wooed African states to the north. The 
courtship fjnally bore full fruit this sum-
mer with Kamazu " kill-apartheid-with 
kindness" Banda, Prime Minister of 
Malawi. Placing politics above principle, 
he became the first black African head 
of state to visit South Africa. 
His visit took the country by storm. 
Throwing his arms around white cabinet 
ministers, hammering the Organization of 
African Unity for its anti-South African 
stance, fondling blonde-haired babies, 
and speaking in favor of a new rapproche-
ment, he was what the country wanted 
to see. Here was a black leader who had 
finally come around to accepting if not 
the philosophy of apartheid, at least its 
pragmatic value. Banda received standing 
ovations everywhere, most strikingly at 
the University of Stellenbosch, which · 
has been the very bastion of Afrikaner 
nationalism, and has produced every 
single prime minister in South African 
history. 

Here were its students applauding 
a black man; a black man who, as the 
newspapers happily told us, had once 
been imprisoned by the British in East 
Africa for nationalist activities. More 
remarkable was a photograph spewed 
across the front pages of the same news-
papers of Prime Minister Vorster seated 
between two Malawian women at a state 
banquet. A few months earlier a nation-
al scandal had arisen when fourteen 
leading citizens of a small, conservative 
town in solid Afrikaner country had 
been charged under the Immorality 
Act, which holds sexual intercourse 
across the color line illegal, and which 
carries a possible death penalty. The 
mayor commited suicide, and the 
charges were dropped. In this context 
the sight of the symbol of white purity 
bravely chatting with two black women 
was strange indeed. It shocked many. 
A transvaal farmer said. "There are two 
things a white man must never do with 
a kaffir: he must not eat with him and 
he must not have his photograph taken 
with him. A photograph is a kind of 
memorial, not so?" 

As this statement suggests, the Banda 
visit did not indicate any significant at-
titudinal change among White South 
Africans; if anything it provided a vin-
dication of their views. 

In another of those peculiar juxta-
positions which South Africa seems to 
specialize in, the American Charles Diggs 
arrived in the country while Banda was 
wowing his former enemies. Diggs, Lead-
er of the Black Caucus in Congress and 
Chairman of the House Sub-committee 
on Africa, was the first prominent 
American to visit the country since 
Robert Kennedy in 1966. In a statement 
on arrival he accused the South African 
government of ··not having the guts" 
to allow him into Southwest Africa 
(Namibia). The accusation provoked 
swift and predictable reaction from the 
Afrikaner press. Hy is Aanstootlik! 
headlined Rapport, a government weekly: 
''He is Revolting" (loosely translated). If 
this is what we can expect from blacks, 
let them stay at home, ran the argument. 
Diggs provoked the ire of sugar farmers 
when he secretly spoke to their workers, 
irritated opposition politicians by arriving 
late for dinner appointments; annoyed 
the government by refusing to meet with 
cabinet ministers: and cancelled inter-
views with them. It was clear that South 
Africans were prepared to accept only 
those who toed the line. If ever a tourist 
was hated, it was Diggs in South Africa. 

The lack of respect with which 
Charles Diggs viewed South Africa seem-
ed to characterize an increasingly com-
mon attitude among non-whites. At the 
Colored Representative Council. which 
the government had given the Coloreds 
in lieu of parliamentary representation 
or a homeland of their. own, chaos reign-
ed. Packed with government stooges, 
the CRC has limited powers and a lim-
ited budget. At the sessions which I at-
tended even the pro-government men 
found it difficult to defend the govern-
ment. From the opposition (anti-apart-
heid) side came a steady, never-ending 
stream of interjections, insults, com-
ments, and jokes: the chamber was 
transformed into a circus as the speaker 
desperately tried to maintain order. 

Here was a legitimate context in 
which to criticize the government. 

To hear a black politician call the 
"group areas act" (which allows whole-
sale removal of communities to create 
"racial balance) "the most inhuman law 
which has ever been created by any 
government anywhere in the world at 
any time in history" was new in the 
South African context. 

·'If white society has to be protected 
by measures like post office apartheid 
and toilet apartheid, is there any sense 
in saving it?'' they asked. One of the 
more radical council members made the 
point to me that both black and brown 
people are retreating from the whites, 
and are regrouping around the power 
points provided by the separate develop-
ment. 

In many ways the most remarkable 
figure on the South African political 
scene at the moment is Chief Gatsha 
Buthelezi, whose logic is similar to that 
of the Coloreds. When I spoke with him 
. in September he had become the most 
quoted politician in the country, and 
perhaps the most important. As chief 
minister of the Zulu "homeland", he 
had become an outspoken critic of 
apartheid in a novel way: by taking the 
government at its word. If you are really 
serious about our independence, give us 
more land. and arms. he argued. If you 
are having dialog with blacks to the 
north. then you must have dialog with · 
blacks inside the country as well. 

'"When we are promised self-govern-
ment." he told me, "it must be clear 
that we do not expect a sham self-gov-
ernment but the real thing ... we ex-
"' 
pect a sympathetic application of the 
policy from the Afrikaners, who them-
selves claim to have a recent history of 
being oppressed. One of the facts which 
the Afrikaners have to face is that we 
have also contributed towards the pro-
duction of South Africa. We will not 
take independence if it will be in the 
spirit of "since you Wllnt independence 
take it and starve." 

He recognizes that given present 
realities the homelands will never be 
given independence: but at the same time 
by exploiting the institutional structures 
of apartheid he can not only make his 
voice heard legitimately but can also 
push the government into positions it 
would not have taken otherwise. 

Buthelezi too, spoke at Stellenbosch 
University, and received as remarkable a 
reception as did Banda. He told the stu-
dents that •'the success or otherwise of 
all these attempts to promote the home-
land policy will depend on the extent 
to which blacks in urban areas, the most 
articulate group of our people, are 
given security of tenure in the urban 
areas. As long as their future is insecure 
and uncertain. our whole future is in-
secure and uncertain." 

As I hitched through Zululand. an 
isolated. traditional part of the country, 
it became clear that not only did Buth-
elezi have massive and active support 
from blacks, but - more surprisingly 
- he was admired by many whites. A 
charismatic figure, he is South Africa's 
Nyerere or Nkrumah, a new type of 
radical who feeds on the inherent con-
tradictions in the political structure and, 
in the process. widens them. He cannot 
afford to be a Marxist in a society

which holds Communism to be the 
worst of all evils; but he has clearly been 
influenced by black radical activity in 
the United States. The day after I saw 
him he spoke at what could only be de-
scribed as South Africa's first black 
power rally at the University of Zululand, 
one of the black colleges. 

Buthelezi's actions and tactics - as 
well as those of other black leaders 
whom he has pushed into a more out-
spoken stance against apartheid - have 
·ted to a re-questioning of government 
policies by all segments of the popula-
tiOn. Throughout my stay in South 
Africa a debate raged as to the future of 
the Colored people, who, because of 
their close cultural ties to the Afrikaner, 
have always occupied a special position 
within the political spectrum. 

:..~ The debate was not restricted to 
politicians, but opened up to intellect-
uals. businessmen. industrialists, and 
the Coloreds themselves. One hundred 
thirty-eight Afrikaner academics pro-
duced a statement calling for "political 
integration" of the Coloreds, while the 
Afrikanese Student bond, a rightist 
student movement, called for the estab-
lishment of a Colored homeland. Even 
the National Party congresses were 
divided on the question. The prime 
minister said the Colored question would 
simply nave to be settled by "our child-
ren." Because the resolution of this 
question is central to the success of all 
governmental policy, it has prompted a 
rethinking of further questions related 
to apartheid. 

The fact is that the nationalist lead-
ership seems no longer to have the intel-
lectual or political ability to resolve 
the evident inconsistencies. As Afrikan-
er nationalism becomes a dying force 
(if it is not dead already), allegiance to 
the party is showing signs of weakening. 
The recent Transvaal party congress com-
plained fewer youths were attending 
church and party rallies, and even 
boeremusiek was losing its grip among 
the Afrikaner young. Even the official 
opposition, a dead and redundant 
political party, made gains in this year's 
general elections for the first time since 
1948.
