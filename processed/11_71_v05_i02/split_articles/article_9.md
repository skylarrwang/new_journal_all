ran for alderman on the Parker ticket 
in one ward. A local plumber was re-
cruited to run for alderman in another 
. neighborhood. 


Mr. Mcintyre cites the issue of the 
state income tax as an example of Sira-
bella's moral courage - contrasted with 
Parker's alleged refusal to take contro-
l'ersial positions. Interested observers 
should review the newspaper statements 
and literature of the two candidates to 
see whether Mr. Mcintyre's analysis 
contains any truth. Hank Parker issued 
several statements supporting the state 
income tax passed by the Connecticut 
General Assembly during the summer. 
He coupled his support with a plea for 
modifying certain rate brackets in order 
to increase the progressivity of the tax. 
As most New Haven proponents of 
the income tax already backed Parker, 
his clear defense of the generally un-
popular levy yielded no new support, 
and risked alienating potential backers. 
Sirabella's position was much less 
clear. In a display of nimble-footed 
semantics. he denounced the Assembly-
approved measure as a "phony income 
tax." Sirabella 's literature attempted to 
harness the conservative backlash gen-
erated by the state income tax, and was 
unclear about his alternative plan. 


Mr. Mcintyre compares the Sirabella 
campaign "without an organization and 
without money" to the "reform machine" 
of the Parker effort. Translated into 
less self-righteous terminology, Mr. Mc-
Intyre is saying that many people vol-
unteered to help Parker while many 
less people offered to help Sirabella. 
To this charge, we must plead guilty. 
The Parker candidacy did stimulate 
board citizen participation which result-
ed in a doubling of Parker's vote from 
his 1969 total. 


As far as campaign spending is con-
cerned, the official financial reports in-
dicate that the two campaigns spent 
roughly equal amounts. More enlighten-
ing is the fact that approximately three-
fourths of Sirabella's campaign expend-
itures was financed by a single individual, 
a wealthy Woodbridge industrialist. 
In contrast, Parker was heavily depend-
ent on several small and moderate size 
contributions. These facts contradict Mr. 
Mcintyre's analysis of the campaigns' 
respective supporters. 


Finally, we must deal with Mr. Mc-
Intyre's assertion that Sirabella formed 
"a coalition of working people of all 
races." Ultimately, his claim to a moral 
victory rests upon this premise. 


The results of the primary show that 
the black wards, and the poorest black 
wards-in particular, voted overwhelm-
ingly for Parker. Even more damaging 
to Mr. Mcintyre's position is the fact 
that in many of the Italian and ethnic 
working-class wards, Parker, a black, 
did as well as Sirabella, an Italian labor 
leader. Thus, on a man-to-man basis, 
Parker battled Sirabella to a stand-off in 
the white, working-class wards where 
Sirabella claimed to have great strength. 
Parker was the pre-eminent candidate of 
students and academics; and he ran far 
ahead of Sirabella in all of the Jewish 
wards. Parker's total vote was five times 
that of Sirabella's.lt was Parker who 
emerged from the primary as the builder 
of a broad-based, left-liberal coalition, 
which included workers and the unem-
ployed. 


One is struck by the self-righteous 
tone of Mr. Mcintyre's article. His state-
ment is essentially a defense of Sira-
bella's continuation to the bitter end 
of his hopeless effort ; despite the re-
sulting division of the left-liberal com-
mut'ity. By discrediting Hank Parker, 
Mr. Mcintyre hopes to justify the kami-
kaze-style of the Sirabella campaign. 


I do not doubt the sincerity or ability 
of Mr. Sirabella, Mr. Mcintyre, or Mr. 
Sirabella's other supporters. Many of us 
in the Parker campaign hoped until the 
last moment that some form of accom-
modation could be reached with Vincent 
Sirabella and his supporters. 


In my contact with Mr. Sirabella, I 
have found him capable, engaging, and 
sincere. I hope to work with him and his 
backers in the future. 


However, the refusal of the Sirabella 
camp to work with Hank Parker canRot 
be jusitified. After Professor Robert 
Abelson's public opinion poll demon-
strated the overwhelming preference of 
the left-liberal community for Parker, 
the inevitable effect of the Sirabella 
CaJ1?paign could only have been to split 
the reform vote. hurt Parker, and help 
Guida. That is precisely what happened 
on election day. It is regrettable that 
New Haven will not have a mayor with 
the ability, compassion, and capacity 
for personal growth of Hank Parker.
