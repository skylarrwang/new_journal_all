. . . sadness that a man of such extaordinary 
intellectual ability, and the finest master of 
the English language to serve as Secretary of 
State since Jefferson, should have .applied his 
talents to waging a form of war rather than 
searching for peace. 

Dean Acheson, who died October 12 at 
78, was the fiercest of American leaders 
during the formative years of the Cold 
War. As Under Secretary of State and 
Secretary of State for President Harry 
S. Truman, he was (to use the arrogant 
but perfectly accurate title of his mem-
oirs) Present at the Creation of the 
basic policies which guided American 
foreign policy for a quarter of a century 
In most instances he was principal author 
of those policies. 

Should we view his career with the 
unstinting admiration naturally expressed 
by his old boss, Harry Truman, and by 
President Nixon? Or with condemna-
tion for his militant role in perpetuating 
the Cold War? More appropriately, 
we should feel sadness that a man of 
such extraordinary intellectual ability, 
and the finest master of the English 
language to serve as Secretary of State 
since Jefferson should have applied his 
talents to waging a form of war rather 
than searching for peace. One can argue 
that Soviet behavior when Acheson was 
Secretary of State left him and the 
American Government no alternatives, 
although even on that I do not agree. 

The greater tragedy is that what were 
at best temporary necessities became 
permanent policies; spreading insecurity, 
suffering, and war through a generation. 

The obituary writers have listed 
Acheson's achievements. In 1946 he ad-
vised President Truman to take a tough 
and threatening stand toward the Soviet 
Union's continued presence in northern 
Iran. In 1947 he was the most import-
ant contributor to the formulation of 
the Truman Doctrine, which promised 
American support for any regime any-
where in the world threatened by in-
ternal or external Communist attack. 
Also in 194 7. he coordinated various 
strands of thought in the American 
Government which ted to the Marshall 
Plan for the economic reconstruction of 
Western Europe with American aid. 

In 1948. momentarily a private citizen, 
he was a leader in the effort to persuade 
the American public and Congress to ac-
cept the Marshall Plan. 

In 1948, as Secretary of State, he 
negotiated the North Atlantic Treaty 
with the other member nations and with 
the American Congress and won approv-
al for the rearmament of Western Eurooe 
by the United States. He then encourag-
ed the formation of the West German 
government system. of European defense 
against the Soviet Union.He learned with 
dismay that the Soviet Union had ex-
ploded an atomic device; advocated the 
development of the hydrogen bomb; 
watched unhappily as the Chinese gov-
ernment won control of mainland China; 
kept foreign policy in balance white the 
nation fought a costly limited war in 
Korea without abandoning Europe as 
the area of primary concern; supported 
the French colonial war in Indochina; 
sought to mediate between declining 
British power and strident nationalism 
in the Middle East; neglected latin 
America; endured accusations of treason 
from irresponsible domestic critics; and 
at all times fenced warily with Moscow 
in the conviction that the nation's sec-
urity would be preserved by the creation 
of positions of strength against the 
Soviet Union, but never by genuine 
negotiation. 

Acheson looked on the Soviet Union 
as an implacable and permanently 
hostile enemy, a true successor to Nazi 
Germany as a threat to the free world. 
For him Western relations with the 
Soviet Union were a zero-sum game. He 
applied a simple test to every American 
move. That which strengthened the 
United States against the Soviet Union 
was good; that which simultaneously 
weakened the Soviet Union was very 
good. That which weakened the United 
States was bad; and that which simul-
taneously strengthened the Soviet Union 
was disastrous. It was inconceivable to 
him that any development which was 
of advantage to the Soviet Union could 
also be of advantage to the United 
States. His favorite slogan was "negotia-
tion from strength." The slogan was 
misleading. He believed that the United 
States should never enter a negotiation 
from a position of weakness. On the 
other hand, when the United States was 
stronger than the Soviet Union, negoti-
ation was unnecessary. 

He once likened the Soviet Union to 
a force of nature, a great river flowing 
inexorably on its course. You cannot 
reason with a river, he said. You can ap-
ply superior strength to contain and 
divert the flow but you can never reason 
with it. Acheson believed that settle-
ments with the Soviet Union (for ex-
ample, the lifting of the Bertin blockade 
in 1949 and the armistice in Korea in 
1953) were the result, not of genuine 
negotiation, but of superior American 
strength. The Soviet Union simply re-
cognized that its power position on 
these issues had become too costly to 
maintain. The facade of ni!9Qtiation 
was erected as a face-saving device, but 
that was all. In a later year he argued 
that only superior military strength 
would solve the Cuban missile crisis. 
He believed that President Kennedy 
made a serious mistake by not bombing 
the missile installations. Similarly he 
believed that a demonstration of Ameri-
can military superiority was a pre-
requisite for a successful solution of the 
Vietnam problem. 

"He believed that it was impossible 
for the United States to have too much 
military strength. He was impatient 
with those who had qualms about the 
size of the American thermonuclear 
arsenal. He was skeptical about the pos-
sibility of international control of 
atomic weapons. 

Acheson did not believe in the dem-
ocratic control of foreign policy. He 
considered the press a mischievous and 
irresponsible institution, Congress ill-
informed and narrow-minded, public 
opinion fickle and unreliable. In his 
ideal world great decisions of foreign 
policy would be made by a small elite 
of highly intelligent and highly trained 
professionals to whom God in His in-
finite wisdom had imparted the necessary 
vision and intelligence. 

He considered the United Nations a 
disorderly and inconvenient body which 
excited Utopian expectations on the part
