of the naive and on occasion gave to 
weakling nations an unjustified voice in 
decisions which would have to be car-
ried out by others. 

Acheson's heritage illuminates his 
policies. His father was a British Army 
Officer before becoming an Episcopal 
clergyman and eventually Bishop of 
Connecticut. His mother was Canadian. 
The British Empire of the late nineteenth 
,~. century was the standard of excellence 
by which he judged American behavior. 
He saw that Empire bringing law and 
order and economic stability to much of 
the world. He saw the United States of 
the mid-twentieth century carrying 
Britain's former burdens in backward 
areas and in holding the world balance 
of power as Britain had once done (al路 
though to Acheson, "balance of power" 
really meant predominance.) He weighed 
the importance of nations by the test of 
economic and military power. 

He felt little sympathy for the new 
and undeveloped nations of what came 
to be called "the Third World." He gave 
no more than lip service to the ideals 
of self-determination and national in路 
dependence. Some people, he believe~ were 
too inefficient or corrupt to deserve in-
dependence. He preferred the crisp milit-
arism of Pakistani leaders to the senti-
1mental moralism of Prime Minister 
Nehru and other Indians. 

In early 1950, Acheson briefly en-
tertained the expectation that Com-
munist China and the Soviet Union 
would have a falling out and would thus 
balance each other to the advantage of 
the West. He said then that the worst 
. thing the United States could do would 
be to engage in some foolish adventure 
which would divert on to its own should路 
ers the na(ural hostility which the 
Chinese felt against foreign encroach-
ment, hostility which deserved to be 
directed against Soviet territorial am-
bitions on the Chinese-Russian border. 
But this attitude was expressed before 
the Chinese entry into the Korean War. 
He was incapable of seeing that the 
Chinese came into the Korean War in 
defense of their own security. He be-
lieved that they, like the North Koreans, 
were acting exclusively as puppets of 
Moscow. After the Chinese entry into 
the Korean War he became as implacable 
in his opposition to China as he was to 
Russia. He abandoned his former theory 
and adhered to the myth of the mono-
lith of international Communism just 
as fervently as did his successor as Sec-
retary of State, John Foster Dulles. 

In the 1940s he was mildly critical 
of French colonial policy in Indochina, 
but he rapidly came to support the 
French military effort there. All the 
later assumptions which guided Ameri-
can policy in Vietnam were developed 
during the Truman Administration under 
Acheson's presiding genius: the belief 
that the Viet_ Minh, later the North 
Vietnamese, were tools of the inter-
national Communist conspiracy; the 
belief that Vietnam was a key to all of 
Asia (if it fell to Communism so would 
the rest of the continent followed by 
the Middle East and even Europe) ; the 
belief in a spec1a1 American talent to 
teach the Vietnamese people to want 
what America wanted and to fight 
for it; and the assumption that the war 
in Indochina could be won on American 
terms if enough military power and 
political ingenuity were applied. 

For the last eighteen years of his 
life Acheson combined his-first career, 
the practice of law, with a third career 
as a man of letters and public oracle on 
international affairs. He became an in-
creasingly outspoken exponent of rigid 
Cold War attitudes, condemning Willi 
Brandt for seeking an accommodation 
between We.st Germany and the Soviet 
Union; lamenting the declining import-
ance and militancy of NATO; praising 
the roles of Portugal, Rhodesia, and 
South Africa in Africa; supporting the 
anti-ballistic missile system; criticising 
President John F. Kennedy in retro-
spect as too weak for the responsibilities 
he faced;oend, above all, supporting the 
American war in Vietnam witflout 
question, although in 1968 he did 
raise some doubts about the ethicacy of 
the American bombing campaign. 

Other men of his generation, Averell 
Harriman, for example. continued their 
education and changed with a changing 
world. Acheson did not. He died in 1971 
with the same attitudes that he brought 
so staunchly to bear as a warrior in the 
Truman era. Measured by how clearly he 
articulated and carried out his policies 
he can be called the greatest Secretary 
of State in American history. Measured 
by the value of his assumptions as a 
permanent guide for American foreign 
policy, the verdict is different. Like the 
government of which he was such an im-
portant part, he acted with more courage 
than wisdom, more a"ogant self.路con-
fidence than toleration and understand-
ing. *
