W hen I first called John Ostrom to ask 
him for an interview he laughed at me. 
Then he asked, "Wiry do you want to do 
this?" I sighed and explained to him that 
his work as a professor of paleontology, 
-his 
relations with 
the 
Peabody 
Museum, and his role in establishing 
Yale's geology field camp in Wyoming 
were all interesting aspects of Yale that 
very few people knew of. He laughed 
again, paused and finally agreed to 
meet with me. 


Although Ostrom seemed reluctant 
to speak to me, I had already heard that 
he was an amiable man who enjoyed 
talking about his work. If you just sit 
d own 
with 
him 
and mention 
De inonychus, 
his 
most 
famous 
dinosaur discovery, then "he just kinda 
grins and will go ofT telling you about 
it," one of his students had said. I de-
cided it was worth a shot. 


At his office in Kline Geology Lab, 
Ostrom, a short, stolid man with a full 
head of wavy grey hair, greeted me with 
a fmn handshake- probably from pick-
ing up large bones, I thought to myself. 
He peered at me over the top of his 
glasses, and led me through his office 
door, which was plastered with draw-
ings and comics. Inside, I stopped 
momentarily to take in the room, filled 
with stacks of papers. Masses of bones 
and skeletons were scattered every-
where, as though a small zoo had ex-
ploded within. He moved some papers 
from a chair for me and I said, •Let's 
talk about Deinonychus." 


Ostrom recalled a 1964 expedition to 
Montana, when his research party dis-
covered a set of very unusual claws "just 
resting on the earth's bare surface." H is 
team excavated the site and unearthed 
what was not only the most extraor-
dinary dinosaur discovered in recent 
years, but vital evidence that some 
dinosaurs were warm-blooded. 


"We brought the remains back to the 
lab here at Yale and reconstructed the 
anatomy," Ostrom said. The animal he 
pieced together, bone by bone, was an 
intimidating beast: a 150-pound, eight-
foot long, two-legged carnivore which 
ran in packs of up to ten and was 
capable of killing animals over five 
times its own weight. "Its most unusual 
aspect, as well as the reason for its 
ferocious ability, was its foot structure. 
Each foot consisted of two toes with a 
third, huge, scythe-like claw. The 
Deinonychus used those two feet for 
walking and for killing. It destroyed its 
prey by hopping on one leg and killing 
with the other, or it used both legs for 
hunting, 
much like 
a 
kick-boxer," 
Ostrom said. 


Deinonychus' strange foot structure 
suggested to Ostrom that the creature 
might have been warm-blooded, a 
theory many of his colleagues doubted. 
•Dinosaurs of all kinds have been tradi-
tionally classified as reptiles because of 
certain anatomical, skeletal, and struc-
tural features that are typical of reptiles 
and not of warm-blooded birds or 
mammals," he explained. •Reptiles are 
cold-blooded ektotherms, meaning they 
need external sources of heat, which is 
why they bask in the sun and are inac-
tive 
until they get 
their body 
temperature up to full level. Mammals 
and birds, however, are capable of 
"It destroyed its prey 
by hopping on one leg 
and killing with the 
other, or it used both 
legs for hunting, 
much like a kick-
boxer." 


The Yale geology camp in Wyoming 
generating their own internal heat and 
can therefore be in continual motion." 


The difference in their metabolism is 
that endotherms function at "full-
throttle," maintaming that constant ac-
tion due to consumption of food . "It's 
important for the animal to run at rac-
ing speed instead of at an idle," Ostrom 
said. 


"When we found Oeinonychus and 
reconstructed its anatomy it proved to 
be a very fast and very agil<' animal, 
quite different from any dinosaur I had 
seen before," he said. All of these factors 
suggested to him that it was a high-
metabolic predator, possibly a mam-
mal. 


Also, 
he 
pointed out 
that 
Oeinonychus could only walk on two 
feet. Leaning forward in his chair, he 
asked me what animal did I kno~ that 
could ong walk on two feeL Without 
waiting for my reply, 0 trom smiled

legs it was more like a bird than a rep-
tile, and therefore mo t likely warm-
blooded. 


There are only 
five existing 
specimens of Demonychus in the world; 
Ostrom keeps Yale's very valuable re-
mains in a file cabinet in his office. He 
led me over to that cabinet and showed 
me the actual vertebrae of Oeinonychus' 
tail, used as a dynamic stabilizer for 
running at high speeds, much like the 
parasol of a tightrope walker. A con-
temporary form of the Oeinonychus, 
the roadrunner, has a very similar taif. 


Ostrom became less formal as he 
carefully removed from the cabinet one 
of the only specimens of Oeinonychus' 
wrist. He pointed out how that wrist 
enabled Oeinonychus to make powerful 
sweeps with its deadly claw and disem-
bowel its unlucky victim. Smiling, he 
took great pride in showing me the wrist 
and then allowing me to hold it. 


Shortly after his discovery, Ostrom 
heard of some colleagues who were 
planning 
to 
use 
name 
"Oeinonvchus" for a dinosaur of their 
own finding. "Most dinosaurs are nam-
ed something-'saurus' and I wanted 
something distinct. I had to have that 
name," he said. So he published a short 
paper describing his find and gave it his 
official name: dino for ~terrible," O'!)X 
for "claw:"' T~bl~ Ckzu.. However in 
1969, when he finally published his 
ground-breaking 
theorv 
on 
Deinonychus, the paleontology com-
munity ,,·as skeptical. His colleagues 
disputed Ostrom's reconstruction of the 
foot, 
key 
to his theory that 
Deinonychus was warm-blooded. 


Ostrom's confirmation came a few 
years later when a joint M ongolian-
Polish expedition in M ongolia made an 
extraordinary discovery: the completely 
intact skeletons of a Veloceraptor, a 
cousin of Deinonychus, and a large 
Protoceratops, which had died in com-
bat together. Not only was the di~osaur 
found clinging to the head of the Pro-
toceratops, but one of its massive claws 
was buried in the plant-eater's chest. 


"You don't know how hard I've tried to 
get in to see that specimen," said 
Ostrom, sitting up in his chair. "But it's 
in Ulan Bator in the People's Republic 
of Mongolia, a part of the USSR which 
is not recognized by the U.S.- no 
diplomatic relations at 
all except 
through Moscow." He has met with his 
M ongolian coun'terpart, but that scien-
tist cannot get the remains out of 
M ongolia for Ostrom to see. Never-
theless, 
rvtongolian 
disco,•ery 
verified Ostrom's theory once and for 
all 


M ore recently. Ostrom has been stu-
dying a different dinosaur called Ar-
chaeopteryx, believed to be the key to 
the evolution of birds from reptiles. 
This controversial theory was first pro-
posed in 1876 by Thomas H enry Hux-
ley, the loyal defender of Charles Dar-
win, and has undergone many twists 
and variations since then. At one point, 
a colleague of Ostrom's named Alick. 
Walker proposed that birds evolved 
from crocodiles. Ostrom responded to 


Walker immediately, having studied all 
of the five ·existing specimens of Ar-
chaeopteryx. Although Archaeopteryx 
had 
feathers 
and other bird-like 
characteristics, Ostrom showed that if 
you took away the feathers, then the 
skeleton looked exactly like a small 
dinosaur. Ostrom had shown conclusive-
ly that Archaeopteryx and birds in 
general must have evolved from small 
carnivorous reptiles. Walker, a professor 
at Newcastle-on-the-Tyne in England, 
has since rejected his own theory and ac-
cepted Ostrom's. 


Ostrom's theory on Archaeopteryx has 
become generally accepted by the paleon-
tology community, and last September 
O strom organized an international con-
ference on Archaeopteryx in order to 
come to an agreement on how flight 
evolved. He called the conference a 
"smashing success" because of the large

He pointed out how

Deinonychus to make

its deadly claw and

unlucky victim. 
number of scientists present. However, 
no unanimous decision was reached and 
most scientists left with 
the same 
opinions on Archaeopteryx that they had 
held before the carne. "The human 
animal is frail in the sense that we 
develop opinions or conclusions and 
unless someone presents overwhelming 
evidence that you are wrong, you tend to 
cling to your belief," Ostrom said. "When 
I 
first 
presented my theories on 
Archaeopteryx people said 'Wow, it's so 
obvious. Why didn't I think of that?' but 
were still reluctant to accept it." 


When he is not busy with conferences, 
teaching or doing research, Ostrom 
serves as the curator vertebrate paleon-
tology at the Peabody Museum. He is 
currently raising over $12,000 for a 
fleshed-out and life-size model of the 
Deinonychus for display at the Peabody. 
Ostrom enjoys his role because he
