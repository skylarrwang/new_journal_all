Once upon a time Yale professors 
were children living in far off lands all 
over the world. Then they grew up and 
journeyed to the heart of New Haven to 
live (perhaps ever after, perhaps even 
happily) in an Ivory Tower. They came 
with books, Ph.Ds and gray blazers and 
soon fell into the way of life there: 
teaching, 
re earching, avoiding red 
tape. In no time their mind were filled 
with worrie and wishes, but many of 
them still carried in the misty chambers 
of distant memory one of their earliest 
educational experience : fairy tales. 

A a child I read fairy tales all the 
time." 
aid Harriet Chessman, who 
teaches "Women's Perspectives on 
Literature" and a eminar on Gertrude 
tein and Virginia Woolf. "I remember 
especially Cinderella was very impor-
tant to me, and all those fairv tales 
about a younge t daughter who had to 
uffer and then would gain through her 
uffering a prince. I under toad 
strongly, even when I was really little, the 
romantic element in a lot of the e 
torie ."' he shook her brovvn curly locks. 
And I was a pure ucker for all of it." 

Toda 
Che sman believe 
she has 
found the secret key to the magic of 
fairy tale . "Fairy tale are like puzzles. 
A child keep going back to them to 
figure out the trangene . The conflict 
i re olved at the end but you're left with 
an odd feeling. You keep di gui ing the 
conflict from your elf a a child. and 
certainly the torie keep di guising it 
from vou."' Che sman tilted her head to 
the jde. '"Maybe that' 
why rm a 
literary critic. I never thought of that." 

Knowing well the power of fairy 
tale , Che man read 
her dau hter 
torie in \路vhich women pia 路 more ac-
tive role . I change the tori 
I read to 
her. I don't have Papa Bear always 
speaking first or yelling or being the 
strongest, and his bowl isn't always the 
biggest," she said referring to Goldilocks. 

But even as a child, Chessman had 
the urge to deconstruct one tale that 
scared her. "Bluebeard went over the 
bounds of disguise to real violence," she 
said, recalling when Bluebeard's wife 
unlocked the one room he forbade her 
to enter. "She goes in there and sees 
blood everywhere from all his other 
wives, and also- though I might be 
making this up- the corpses of all his 
dead wives. And in the heart of the 
room is this pool of water, or maybe a 
crystal ball, and she looks into it and 
sees him 
looking back 
at her." 

Chessman paused and then whispered, 
"That's how he knows to come and kill 
her." 

"I liked Bluebeard because the wife 
escapes in the end," said Rory Browne, 
dean of Branford College, who read a 
different ver ion of the story while 
growing up in England. "You've got all 
these grisly corpses hanging in the 
wardrobe, but her brothers come and 
kill Blue beard." Browne was sent to 
English Catholic boarding school at the 
tender age of seven. "We heard an 
awful lot of stories about saints and 
martyrs," he said paling a bit. "Martyr-
dom was held out a a role model to u 
all." In school Browne pined away for his 
home in London next to the Regent' 
Park Zoo where he spent "night lying 
in bed listening to ea lions croaking." 

He remembered liking Saint Francis of 
A i i, 
because he talked with the 
animals. 

Bro\\.ne, who now teaches a graduate 
history seminar "Power and Privilege " 
remembered a "dreadful tory"' his aunt 
forced him to hear a a child. " he was a 
dentist and worried about mv habit of 
ucking my thumb " he aid, clutching 
both thumb with hi forefinger ... She 
took particular intere t in reading me 
the 路tory of The Long-Legged Tailor from 
thi German book '-vith gha tl , illu tra-
tions. There was a little boy who sucked 
his thumbs all the time, and then sud-
denly his parents warned him that if he 
didn't stop, the Long-Legged Tailor 
would get him. One day his parents go 
out, the door of the room swings open 
and this terrible figure," Browne drew a 
monstrous form in the air, "like some 
lalloping kangaroo, strode into the 
room, took out these enormous iron 
shears," he 1 reached into his blazer 
pocket, "a11d cut off the boy's thumbs. 
las~ illustration shows the boy 
holding up his hands with two bleeding 
stumps d_ripping blood down onto the 
floor into some sort of sticky red pool." 

Browne caught his breath. "I hated that 
story." 

Far away from Browne's wicked 
aunt, in southwest Mexico, lived Hec-
tor Calderon, now a profe sor of 
Chicano literature. Calderon also suf-
fered a fairy tale torture similar to 
Browne's. As a boy, Calderon could not 
fall asleep until his grandmother told 
him a story. He remembered vaguely 
stories about little horses and little peo-
ple living in little worlds, but one story 
he could not banish from his memory 
was La Llorona, or The Wailing Woman. 

"My grandmother told us the story of 
La Llorona, a woman who kills her 
children and has to go throughout the 
world wailing. My grandmother and 
others 
wore 
they 
had 
heard La 
Llorona. We knew thi woman was out 
there somewhere behind the garage, in 
the dark night, in the alley." Suddenly 
the child disappeared and the academic 
returned. "The function of this, as I ee 
it now, was to keep the kids in line. If 
you were doing something your parent 
didn't want you to do, they would evoke 
La Llorona." 

Kai Erikson, editor of The Yale Review 
and ociology profe or, confe sed he 
could not find the trail of breadcrumb 
to hi memory of childhood torie . He 
remembered likin 
Pinocchio but 
couldn't remember the character or 
plot. "A lot of the e torie are just plain

si~ly and no one remembers them later. 
They could have been songs or games 
or even nonsense syllables," he said, 
vehemently brushing aside an im-
aginary pile of stories. Then, clasping 
his hands back together, the sociology 
professor explained, "The most impor-
tant part 路 was the ritual of sitting 
together in a family group- it's a kind 
of embrace- reading the story, hearing 
the sound of the voice and the affection 
expressed by it." 

"The only things I remember are the 
scary things," said Faye Crosby, pro-
fessor of psychology, who gave her 
Oedipal analysis of one of her favorite 
childhood stories, Babar. "At one point 
in the story Babar's mother gets shot. I 
think children love that part even 
though they also hate it. I also loved the 
movie Bambi, where Bambi's mother is 
also shot and killed," said Crosby, who 
teaches psychology courses on justice 
theory and women. "Kids are both 
repelled and fascinated with the idea of 
losing their mothers. That makes them 
very vulnerable and very liberated at 
the same time. Didn't you ever feel that 
way?" 

Arthur Galston, plant biology pro-
fessor, spoke about his favorite part of 
Rapunzel. "I remember her hair being let 
down and the prince climbing up the 
tower," he said, sitting near the window 
of his ninth floor office in Kline Biology 
Tower. "And I remember a whole host 
of stories about a dragon that has to be 
conquered by a knight who has to 
rescue a damsel in the tower." Galston, 
known for his invention of TIBA which 
was later used by the Department of 
Defense to create Agent Orange, said 
Little Red Riding Hood scared him as a 
child. "I remember a drawing of a wolf 
in grandma's bed with a night cap on, 
sharp teeth, slathering a bit at the 
mouth. It made me suspicious of people 
who should be benign but have another 
side to them." 

Lars Engle, who teaches English 114, 
English 125, a Shakespeare seminar 
and Daily Themes, found the path to 
academic princehood as a young lad. 
"My mother read me The Iliad when I 
was six. She said I kept track of the 
minor characters better than she did," 
he said, grinning to himself. Engle, 
nevertheless, did not lose compassion 
for those less precocious than he. "I liked 
stories where the last shall come first. 
For example, the third simple brother 
who is thumped upon by his brothers 
goes out into the world and wonderful 
things happen to him usually because of 
his kindness to animals, not his aggres-
sion." 

Six years after The Iliad, Engle read 
The Lord of the Rings. "I was terribly, 
passion~tely involved with that world 
which was so entirely . self-containing 
and a relief from the moral dilemmas of 
adolescence." He spoke more quickly, 
"It clearly idealized asexual fantasy, and 
in some ways is imperialist and quasi-
racist." He returned to his earlier 
nostalgic tone, "But it's still gripping. 
It's so academic. Anyone who wants 
any power has to know at least three or 
four languages. And various forms of_ 
self-denial are integrally related with 
power." 

Next time you're sitting among hun-
dreds of other bobbing heads in lecture 
or around the close confines of a 
seminar table take a careful look at your 
professor. For once upon a time Yale 
professors read stories with mono-
syllabic words, simple plots and happy 
endings. They might not think much of 
them today, but those stories opened up 
worlds of fantasy, introduced them to 
the quirks of adult life and possibly had 
a 
greater impact than they might 
realize. Today some of the enchantment 
still remains in these grown up children. 
In the words of Robert Thompson, 
master of Timothy Dwight, "Anything 
that enriches our fantasy life is wonder-
ful. Our fantasy life is one of our 
dearest preserves. It gives children 
something to dream for and dream 
through."
