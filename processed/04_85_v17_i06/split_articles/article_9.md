Naming Names 
To the Editor: 
I read your Special Issue, March 1, 
with great interest. I began at Yale the 
fall of 1977, in the new Special Student 
Program and therefore constituted both 
a female and older student participating 
in a "neW' and "nearly neW' situation at 
the University. 
I will graduate this May with the Class 
of '85 at the age of 50, part of another 
"frrst" for Yale-the B.L.S. degree 
(Bachelor of Liberal Arts). 
I have 
witnessed many positive changes for the 
undergraduate woman at Yale, both 
young and old during this eventful 
time. 
I recognized many friends among the 
names of female graduates on your 
cover. However the names of the four 
women receiving B.L.S. degree on May 
24th were not included in the Class of'85. 
This relieves me of any anxiety I 
may have had, that as a female, and 
older I was somehow conspicuous at 
Yale. 
Yours truly, 
Beverly Criley Graham, '85 

Edilor's Note: 
The New Journal apologizes for any 
oversights and errors 
on 
our cover. 
Unfortunately, a more accurate list of senior 
women was not aJXZiJable to us.

**Clarification**

Clarification 
In the March 1 issue of The NewJouT'TUll, 
the photo of Lisa Melfi and the women's 
crew team on page 56 was mistakenly 
credited to Pearl Hu. The photographer 
was Carter Brooks. The New Journal 
apologizes for this error. 
In "A Different Ballgame," the river on 
which the crew teams practice was 
mistakenly identified as the Derby. The 
river is the H~usatonic; Derby is the 
name of the town. Also, Nancy Harthun 
is TC '87. 
In "The Compleat Cartoonist," 
Pamela Boynton's middle child was 
mistakenly identified. His name is Keith. 
In "The Tenure Gap," Professor of 
Philosophy Ruth Marcus stated that the 
comparative literature department had 
not tenured women faculty members. 
Margaret 
Ferguson 
and 
Barbara 
Johnson were given tenure by the 
department in 1984.
