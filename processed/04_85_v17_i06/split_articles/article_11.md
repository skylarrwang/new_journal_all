American Pop in Print 
The story of Nadine is one of obsession. 
In the Chuck Berry song, the obsession 
is with a woman the narrator sees while 
riding a bus. But Julian Dibbell, DC 
'86, and Joe Levy, BK '86, share a dif-
ferent obsession- with music as a 
whole, and, specifically, with Nadine, 
their 
newly-created 
Yale 
music 
â€¢ 
magazme. 

Despite the interest in music here, 
particularly in popular music, Dibbell 
and Levy feel students can seldmn ex-
press their interest or learn more about 
music. "It struck us that there just aren't 
enough outlets for writing about music 
at Yale," Dibbell said. "So last -semester, 
at a Chopin concert in an opera house 
in Ouro-Preto, Brazil, I decided to start 
the publication." 

Levy and Dibbell define popular 
music as "music made with recording 
and selling in mind- music geared to 
the mass market, which unfortunately 
excludes almost all jazz and classical 
music." Nadine focuses on popular 
music, yet Dibbell and Levy also want 
to write about other musical styles in-
cluding jazz. 

According to Levy, their publication 
has a much more serious approach to 
popular music than generally found at 
Yale. It will include articles about 
records and bands and analyses of dif-
ferent aspects of music. Although it is a 
serious publication, Dibbell admits, "I 
get scared about being so pretentious as 
to say it must be intelligent. I also want 
it to be humorous." 

In fact, 
after considering several 
names for their publication, Dibbell 
and Levy chose the title of a 1964 
Chuck Berry song. "It's got elegance 
and Americana," Dibbell explained, 
"although the song is politically incor-
rect, because there's so much sexism." 
"Rock and roll itself is politically incor-
rect," Levy said. The political aspect of 
nwsic could develop into an article, and 
Dibbell and Levy may broaden the 
magazine's scope to include not just 
popular music but popular culture as 
well. 

The Davenport College Coucil has 
allotted Dibbell and Levy $250 to $300 
for the first issue, due out April 26. 
They are now searching for advertisers, 
because they still need $300 to 
500. 

Dibbell and Levy expect to continue 
Nadine during the 1985-86 school year 
publishing three times a semester. Said 
Levy, "It's going to have a lot of rough 
edges, but it's also going to have a lot of 
heart and soul."
