Slavery and Human Progress 
by David Brion Davis 
1984 Oxford University Press 
For most Americans the word "slavery" 
conjures up images of the antebellum 
deep South, of overseers with whips and 
blacks in cotton fields. Yet the institu-
tion of slavery dates back to the start of 
recorded history in Mesopotamia, and 
it was not even until the late 18th cen-
tury that slavery was considered a sin 
against morality. Instead, slavery was 
generally thought to be a system of 
labor which benefitted both captor and 
captive, condoned by governments and 
churches in all parts of the world. 
Sterling Professor of History David 
Brion Davis has spent most of his 
academic career studying the problem 
of slavery, and his new book, Slavery and 
Human Progress, continues his writing on 
the subject. The book is an ambitious 
mixture of historical 
research and 
Davis's own "moral philosophy," a com-
bination which gives the book an emo-
tional impact very rare and very 
welcome in historical writing. 
Davis's 
thesis 
is simple but 
fascinating: slavery has always been in-
extricably linked with changing con-
cepts of "progress," and in mockrn 
history there has been a "momentous 
shift from 'progressive' enslavement to 
'progressive' emancipation." He writes, 
"From Plato onward even the visions of 
a utopian society toward which humans 
might evolve assumed the continuing 
existence of slaves. 
Progress, 
however conceived in 
the ancient 
world, 
was 
fully 
compatible with 
human 
bondage." For Christians, 
Muslims and Jews alike, religion sanc-
tified the enslavement of"outsiders" who 
would receive, in theory, the benefits of 
a superior civilization and religion. In 
one instance, "Papal briefs of the 1450s 
authorized the Portuguese King or 
Order of Christ to conquer and reduce

to 
perpetual 
slavery the infidels, 
pagans, unbelievers, and enemies of 
Christ . . . " The enemies of Christ were 
not necessarily blacks, however; such 
physical distinctions were attributed to 
factors like climate and environment. 
But inspired by Biblical language, non-
blacks began to associate the color with 
things dangerous and unholy, and such 
feelings were easy to transfer to black 
Africans. 
Nonetheless, slavery did not become 
widely entrenched in modern Europe 
until after the Black Death of the 14th 
century, when Europeans desperate for 
a labor force increasingly turned to 
African slavery. Over the course of cen-
turies 
European 
slave 
trade 
developed into a hugely profitable in-
dustry which helped ensure nations' 
economic growth. As Davis argues, "the 
vast majority of eighteenth-century 
policymakers and commentators 
equated slaves with wealth and national 
greatness." Tragically, it was indeed 
true that slaves played a vital part in the 
expansion and progress of Western 
civilization. 

But the nineteenth century brought 
momentous changes 
for 
enslaved 
blacks. Britain would outlaw slavery in 
the West Indies in 1833; the United 
States fought a civil war, in part 
because of agitation over chattel 
slavery; France, Brazil and numerous 
other countries would abolish slavery in 
their domains before the century ended. 
According to Davis, "The Western 
world was beginning to view slavery as 
an intolerable obstacle to human pro-
gress-as an economic <f{lachronism as 
well as an offense to Christian morality 


and human rights." For Davis, the next 
question is what caused this immense 
shift in ideals of progress and attitudes 
toward slavery. 

T o find an answer, Davis looks close-
ly at the history of the abolitionist 
movement in Great Britain, the first 
"civilized" country to abolish slavery. 
British 
abolitionism began with 
a 
Quaker revival in the 1770s, a move-
ment which confronted the paradox of 
slavery in a country that prided itself on 
setting a moral example for the rest of 
the world. The Quakers' rejection of 
slavery spread to other religious groups, 
and in time the denunciation of slavery 
became a religious rite of purification 
akin to renouncing drinking, gambling 
and other sinful forms of "worldliness" 
As Davis writes, "Testimony against 
slavery became a crucial symbol of 
'serious religion.'" 
Evangelical 
abolitionists 
argued that slavery had become an im-
passible obstacle to the country's pro-
gress. It was an institution that had no 
moral, religious or economic justifica-
tion for being. Yet the abolitionists as 
well as their opponents feared the 
eradication of slavery would mean the 
collapse of the British 
plantation 
economy in the West Indies, and 
theorized 
that 
emancipated 
slaves 
would (and should) still be bound to 
their former masters. Predicted aboli-
tionist James Stephen, "The dread of 
starving" will be "substituted for the dread 
of being flogged." Similarly, 
both 
groups feared that freeing the slaves 
would create a permanent underclass of 
indolent and possibly rebellious blacks. 
In his explanation of how the British 
government gradually took up the cause 
of emancipation, Davis reveals his 
esteem for any government that would 
act against its economic and diplomatic 
interests for the sake of human rights. 
Though cognizant of the pragmatic 
arguments against emancipation, the 
British Parliament clearly favored the 
cause of humanity, both in their own 
territories and in foreign lands.
