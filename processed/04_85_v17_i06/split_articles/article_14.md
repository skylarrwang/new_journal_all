Students in a Wilbur Cross classroom
these construction paper signs. H e
lowered his voice so his seniors could
concentrate on reading their second
novel, a sixth-grade level book about
reverse discrimination.

"I don't teach it like a remedial level
class," he said. "They've done what many
people thought they couldn't do. I take
the gossipy approach with a book-
'Hey, what happened to Sam Saturday
night?' They're curious, they like peo-
ple. I love the age group because they
want attention, and a lot of times in the
homes they don't get it." Lucibello, who
described his work as a
ministry,
-pointed to success stories in his grade
book-D+'s going to B's, Fs going to
C + 's. Next to the book were adver-
tisements from the book club he en-
C<;>uraged his class to join. He spoke of
hts plans to teach them creative writing.
-.:here are students with good ideas," he
satd, "just sometimes I think they've
never been asked to put them on paper.
A lot of times they've given up, and I
don't see why they should."

Teachers in other departments also
have to cope with students working op
lower grade levels. Forty percent of the
students work on remedial math skills,
and some ninth and tenth graders use a
firth grade science book. According to
hiStory teacher Andrew Bram in an in-
terview with the NeUf Haven Register,
"Years ago there were levels in these
subjects, but education has passed
through a phase when nobody wanted
anyone to feel they were labeled. It's
self-defeating.
How do
you
meet
everybody's needs? Sometimes what
happens is, you just try to reach as
many kids as you can."

Dr. Gerald Cuddy teaches an ac-
counting class fifth period. Like many
of the teachers at Cross, he has been
teaching here for almost 20 years. "You
can come in with your standards up
here and the kids down here," he said,
indicating a gap of about three feet, "but
~hat doesn't prove anything. You have
to adjust your standards. I like working
with inner city youngsters because it's
much more rewarding. To motivate
them, success is a key. I know teachers
who brag about failing 22 out of 24
students. There are some people who
say you should keep them back, and
then they drop out at 16, and they can't
even get a job in the post office or police
department without a
high school
degree." H e was interrupted by a girl
who wanted to go to the bathroom, but
he didn't give her a pass. Bathrooms are
locked during first, third and fifth
periods, and students can be severely
reprimanded for walking in the halls
without a pass.

"Seventy percent of the public school
students in New Haven are on public
assistance," he said. "They have the
problem of not having guidance at
home. They don't have anyone at home
telling them to go to school or to get
their pencils."

As Cuddy spoke in the back of the
room, several of his students argued
near his desk. One girl raised her voice,
saying, "If you want to have a baby,
