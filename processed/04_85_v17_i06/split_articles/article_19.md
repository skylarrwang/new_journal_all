about 'individual disappointments.' "It's 
tough to respond to the parents. If I say, 
'Look, we bent over backwards and your 
kid still didn't get in,' it only makes them 
feel worse," he said. "My most difficult 
cases are the ones who got into Harvard 
and not into Yale. And then there's the 
guy who gets really mad and writes us a 
few years later to inform us of his son's 
election to Phi Beta Kappa. There's just 
not that much I can do." 

Every year, Holcombe informs the 
Admissions Committee about parents' 
involvement in development projects, in 
terms of donations and alumni work. He 
realizes, 
however 
success 
is 
never 
assured. "Each year we wait anxiously for 
the print-out to come over from Admis-
sions. There have been some things that 
have delighted us and there have been 
some major disappointments." 

Although in a sense every legacy 
applicant is Holcombe's concern, he 
targets the most important cases. David 
explained, "Like Carm Cozza, Terry tells 
me what he wants-and the people at the 
top of his list are important to us." 

Like minorities and legacies, athletes' 
applications also receive an additional 
reading in the admissions process. The 
big spectator sports, particularly football, 
receive top priority in athletics admis-
sions. "Each year our coaches are in con-
tact with and receive applications from 
between 1500 and 2000 students in-
terested in playing varsity sports," Direc-
tor of Athletics Frank Ryan estimated. 

Football players who fall into this 
category receive 'top,' 'middle' or 'bottom' 
ratings according to their ability and their 
interest in Yale. Describing candidates in 
the top category, David said, "If we think 
they are representative of the rest of their 
class academically, then they will prob-
ably be admitted. A comparable can-
didate who does not play sports has only 
a one in four chance. Football players are 
not necessarily stellar students, and it's 
probably fair to say that they don't crowd 
the ranks of Phi Beta Kappa. But if 
they get caught up only in sports, we've 
wasted a spot. I know we make some

mistakes, because other people tell us 
about them. Those people don't realize 
that we're generally taking kids from 
blue-collar backgrounds for whom the 
benefit of a Yale education is great." 

Each year the football coaches give the 
Admissions Office's 
two athletic 
coordinators the names of some 250 
players. About 95 of these candidates will 
be accepted, which works out to an ad-
mission rate of between 30 and 40 per· 
cent, greater than the rate for minorities 
but less than that oflegacies. Yale counts 
on a good deal of attrition. As:;istant 
Coach Sebastian Laspina said , "We want 
to see 50 kids out for the freshman team 
and 30 from each of the upper classes." 

"Admissions defmitely looks out for 
us," said Laspina, who supervises football 
recruiting. "But like everybody else, Ad· 
missions gets caught up in the glamor 
spots. There's been a shortage oflinemen 
over the past few years, and linemen are 
crucial." Laspina explained that football 
players from prep schools have little 
chance of being accepted. "A kid from the 
deep South or far West '"'-ill have a higher 
rank and that will make Admissions look 
better. Yale is ,·ery conscious of what 
other schools think of its admissions stan· 
dards." 

Although they do not offer athletic 
scholarships. Ivy League colleges do ag· 
gressively recruit athletes, particularly 
football players. According to David ... All 
schools spend a disproportionate amount 
of time on athletic recruiting." 

Somewhat uneasy over the treatment


"Academic promise 
alone is not in most 
cases enough to get a 
student into Yale. We 
want to be able to 
find the kid a 
roommate." 

he has received from the press, Ryan 
described athletic recruiting in very low-
key terms, stressing that all the sports 
programs look for athletes who can profit 
from several different aspects of the Yale 
experience. "We don't sell the kids Yale 
athletics," Ryan said. "We sell them 
Yale." Coach Laspina agreed. "We want 
a kid who's going to feel at home and isn't 
going to stick out academically or socially. 
The attrition rate is pretty high, and we 
don't want some goon running around 
here who's wrecked his knee and decides 
he doesn't want to play any more." But 
for Laspina, football recruiting is clearly a 
business. "Coaching isn't different from 
any job in the real world. We have to pro-
duce. If we don't get good kids, we'll start 
losing consistently. The administration 
will think we're dumb, and then we'll be 
out of a job." 

Thus motivated, 
football coaches 
spend much time and money recruiting. 
Every spring they mail a letter to coaches 
at almost every high school in the coun-
try, expressing interest in players in the 
top 10 percent of their class with SAT 
SCOres over 1200- the 20th percentile of 
each Yale class. High school coaches, 
under pressure to get their players into a 
good college, will often overlook these 
academic requirements and give Yale the 
names of less qualified players. 

Under NCAA regulations, Coach 
Cozza and his staff must wait until 
December 1 to visit players at the high 
schools, where they pick up filins of each 
candidate's performance during one 
game. If a player passes his ftlm test, he 
is invited to Yale for an all-expense-paid 
weekend. He is housed with a member 
of the team and shown the campus, 
sports facilities and football highlight 
ftlms. Laspina added however, "I make 
sure they take him to the libraries, show 
him the academic stuff. I like it when a 
player gets to a Friday class." 

Mike Curtin, OC '86, favorably re-
called his recruiting experience. "I had 
signed a letter of intent to go to the 
University of Utah back in my home 
state. I never thought I'd get into Yale, 
but when I did I remember thinking, 
'Gee, I really want to go visit, just to see 
the place.' On my visit, the thing that 
made me decide to come here was Coach 
Cozza. He didn't even talk football. He 
talked about my decision in terms of the 
total experience. He said the experiences 
you'll have here will be like no place else. 
On the plane ride home, I decided to try 
to get out of my letter of intent." 

John Zanieski, SM '85, added, "When 
1 came to Yale, I saw that the football 
players commanded a lot of respect, both 
among themselves and among the stu-
dents generally. It looked like a classy 
organization." 

Ryan would not disclose the budget for 
athletic recruiting, saying that the figures 
are "difficult to ir.terpret correctly." He 
did say the budget is •comparable to that 
of other Ivy League schools." David 
noted that funding comes not only from 
the University, but also from separate 
alumni funds for the individual sports. 

Comparing athletic recruiting to other 
admissions recruiting, David said, "We 
fly on super-saver flights. You can't get 
that bringing in an athlete for the 
\O."Cekend. I wouJd imagine that th• 
athletic recruitment budget is much 
larger than ours and far larger than the 
$29,000 we devote to our student minori-
ty recruitment budget." 

Even with that relatively small amount 
of money, minority admissions and 
recruitment at Yale have come a long 
way, according to Muhammed Abdullah, 
'70, the director of minority recruitment. 
"In the 1960s when I attended Yale," Ab-
dullah said, "there were only about a 
hundred other black students on campus. 
I'd see someone on the street who looked 
like me and I'd stop because it was so 
unusual." 

During 
the same 
period, 
Black 
Students at Yale (BSA Y) persuaded 
Clark to accept an informal quota for 
black applicants. After a corresponding 
initial rise, the number of minority ap-
plicants and matriculants has fluctuated 
widely since the 1960s. Since Abdullah 
began work in 1981, numbers in both 
groups have risen substantially. But cam-
pus minority groups protest the declining 
rate of admission for minority students, 
which hit an all-time low of 24 percent 
last year. 

This phenomenon is most pronounced 
among Asians, whose applications have 
quadrupled over the past four years and 
who will reportedly face an admission 
rate below that of whites this year. Tom 
Saenz and William Oh, both ES '87 and 
co-chairmen of the minority recruitment 
program, are alarmed. "This couJd hap-
pen eventually to any minority group," 
Oh said. "Asians are competing with 
other Asians for the same slots and are 
practicaJy being penalized for having 
large numbers of qualified applicants. 
The legacy admit rate remains steady, 
while ours drops each year. The policy ig-
nores the fact that Asians still face 
discrimination." 

David defended his policy firmly. "The 
Admissions Office has examined the 
tremendous increase in Asian applicants, 
and we've found that the increase has 
been in suburban, professional Asians. 
Standards are tougher for them. It's not 
the lower-income, urban Asian who is 
gening squeezed out." But because the 
Admissions Committee meetings are 
closed, it is difficult for David to clarify 
this process. This controversy over the 
limits of affirmative action will probably 
not be settled until the Executive Com-
rnitteeonAdmissions Policy holds its next 
meeting, most likelr next year, according
