"It seems poverty and 
learning are going 
hand in hand, and 
New H aven is a poor 
city." 
At the foot of East Rock, near the Vic-
torian houses and yellow buses, parents 
drop their children off at a school where 
one student in seven has a child. At 
Wilbur Cross, one of New Haven's 
three high schools, half of the ninth 
grade reads at or below the sixth grade 
level, some at the third or fourth grade. 
Seventeen-year-olds recently released 
from prison share instructors with pro-
fessors' children headed for top colleges. 
Teachers struggle to be heard, then 
listened to. And behind the scenes, ad-
ministrators try to find a balance be-
tween strictness and fairness. 

Cross's present problems are symp-
tomatic of those facing inner city 
schools throughout the country. They 
demand solutions, or will handicap 
students in their search for employment 
and financial independence. Yet Cross 
is a better, safer school than it was 15 
years ago, when 
racial 
tensions 
threatened to disrupt classes, or in 
1978, when a teacher was murdered in 
the school store. The ethnic diversity 
which once split the school, with its 65 
percent black, 16 percent white and 19 
percent Latino population, is now one 
of its greatest strengths. Through the ef-
forts of dedicated people, not complex 
methods, not money, the school aims 
for order, then growth. 

Of Cross's 1613 students, 200 are 
enrolled 
in 
English as a 
Second 
Language (ESL) courses, which they 
can take for only three years before 
joining regular classes. Next to a script 
alphabet, a poster on the wall of Maria 
Pennachio's ESL first period class read, 
"Live up to your potential." She raised 
her voice over the Spanish words of her 
five students. "Be on time to lectures," 
she said. "You have to be overly pushy 
with you guys. Take out your note-
books and worksheets, together with a 
pen and pencil, which should be on 
your desk at this moment. Now we will 
cover the present continuous tense. How 
do we form that? Ay ay ay, come on 
everyone." The chatter quieted down a 
bit. "First you get the infinitive." She 
worked on the assigned exercises, then 
continued the lesson with a discussion of 
table manners in various Spanish-
speaking countries. 

"Louis," she said, "why are you not 
participating?" 

"Cause I had a fight last night. I don't 
feel right." 

Marie Fadus teaches an advanced class, 
called "the Yale kids" or "the back-pack 
generation." One of her students sat in 
the back of the room reading Time 
magazine, putting it down to take a 
spelling test- words from Moby Dick 
like magniloquent, argosy, unctuous and turbid. A student asked how ambergris was 
discovered, and Fadus suggested he 
look it up in an encyclopaedia and 
report to the class later. 

"I'm reading this aloud, because it's 
so exciting," she said, holding a copy of 
Melville in one hand, shaking her other 
fist for emphasis and pausing to point 
out examples of onomatopoeia. She 
discussed Plato, Kant and Locke, and 
their relation to Transcendentalism. 
She talked about victimization and 
foreshadowing. Five of the 28 students 
were professors' children, Fadus ex-
plained, and the rest were from the 
nearby area. 

In her next class Fadus teaches four 
parents. Sixteen students filed in, smell-
ing of cigarettes, pushing the desks to 
the back of the room, giving random 
hugs and high-fives. "Who's the darling 
who's got my marking book?" Fadus 
asked. After ten minutes of searching 
for the book and taking attendance, she 
told the class to write an imaginary let-
ter to Ann Landers. She explained Ann 
Landers and her job to several of the 
students, then collected their letters and 
read them aloud, encouraging the class 
to answer them. 

"Dear Ann Landers," she read. "Why 
do rich people have a lot of cars, and


poor people don't have cars and have to 
walk?" 

"Dear Ann Landers, I am 14 years 
old and I have a 23-year-old boyfriend. 
He doesn't like making love and I do. I 
sometimes feel there's someone else in 
his life that he loves, but he says he 
loves me. What do I do?" The class 
laughed relentlessly, guessing who had 
written it. 

"Dear Ann 
Landers, I have a 
boyfriend who's fooling around, but I 
have a baby by him. I want to tell his 
new girlfriend. What should I do?" 

"Send her a diaper," suggested a boy in 
the back row. 

Fadus looked a bit drained by the 
beginning of third period. "It's physically 
exhausting to be in this building," she 
said. "Some children are unwilling to 
learn, and there's almost nothing you 
can do about that. It seems poverty and 
learning are going hand in hand, and 
New Haven is a poor city. But the stu-
dent body has improved in ten years 
-there's a willingness to follow the 
rules. The greatest pleasure in teaching 
is to watch the mind grope and grow 
and be unbiased. And the greatest ad-
vantage Cross offers these youngsters is 
to be mixed up all together." 

"You can make it!!" "Please do not 
Socialize in the Classroom!" "Learn to 
LISTEN!" "Show Respect!" In the very 
quiet classroom, 
English 
teacher 
Michael Lucibello sat at his desk under
