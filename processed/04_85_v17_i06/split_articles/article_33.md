This issue's Aflnthought cvmes from an interview with Molly Armstrong, 
CC '84 who was an American Studies mqjor. 7he interview was ediud by 
joyce &n")tt, ediwr-in-chiej of The New Journal. 

Like many Yale alumni, I work in New York City. Every morn-
ing, I lea\e my room and "''alk past 42nd Street, past peep shows 
and bookstores, to a large, horseshoe-shaped building just off 
Times ~uare. As one of the volunteers here at Covenant 
House, a short-term crisis center for homeless youth, my work 
day begins at eight a.m., when I get all the girls over 18 out on a 
jobsearch. Then, I review the new cases, the kids who walked in-
to the c;hdtcr just last night. Usually, we have 200 children stay-
ing at the House, although there are only 110 beds. Mats on the 
floor and couches in TV rooms substitute temporarily for the 
street or sub\\ay trains. We give them towels and sheets, feed 
and sometimes clothe them. 

CO\enant House is a sanctuary. The kids here, all under 21, 
are running, either from a pimp or a family or a group home. 
Their experiences match nothing we think of as typical of 
childhood. I contact a child's parents on[y with her permission, 
and the House reunites a good portion of the children with their 
families, prO\ided no abuse is involved. The average stay is six 
days, too little time to change their lives. Because I must con-
stantly choose between imperfect solutions, my idea of success 
has changed. Success here only occurs on a small scale. 

Along v.ith handing out toilet paper and serving meals, I 
"crisis counser- talking down the suicidal, breaking up fights 
~1o:.tlv I deal with children who have always thought no one 
cared ·\\hethcr thev lived or died. I get hugs and curses, but all I 
do throughout is listen. always listen. 

I alway enjoyed listening. I loved being fresJu:t~ counselor, 
and because I \\as such a good listener. I almost dtdn t graduate. 
As graduation approached, however, I realized that "good 
listener" could not be listed on my resume. In fact, I could list 
fe"' concrete achievements, and yet I believed I had to fmd a 
career immediately. at 21. .The more I looked for a job, the 
more confused I became. Finally, I turned to examine the 
resourct•s I had, namely, myself. Young and without obligations, 
I knew I could take chances; I was free to do anything. I decided 
then not to foUow the standard Yale senior route of resumes and 
CAPS. Stank\ Kaplan and graduate .;chool. 

Fe\" people felt as I did. Like m)"'Clf, they had debts to pay 
off, and o:o they needed to earn sizable salaries. But I felt more 
than the need to succeed fmancially, I felt the need to grow. In-
stead of reading theory and discussing hypothetical situations, I 
itched to go out and act. I wanted to test myself and felt I could 
through volunteer work. 

M y parents and my close friends understood and supported 
my decision. However, others who were only acquaintances 
began to feel uneasy around me. I knew my decision was my 
own, not a judgement on the actions of other people. But at a 
time when seniors have to think about their responsibilities to 
family or debt or tradition, some people made choices they were 
uncomfortable with. Perhaps they were like a friend of mine 
who graduated two years before me. H is freshman year he 
picketed Morgan Stanley for some of their activities in the Third 
World. Senior year he applied for a job with them when he saw 
the fmancial responsibilities awaiting him. 

In the city, I occasionally run into other Yalies on the street. I 
have nothing in common anymore with most of them. We made 
such choices that our lifestyles simply do not overlap. 

For my work at Covenant House, I receive 12 dollars a 
week, room and board. The House is a Catholic institution, and 
I live in the lay religious community attached to it. The 
volunteers, ranging from 22 to 71 years of age, sign up for a 13 
month stint, the frrst month devoted entirely to training. 

My work as a tutor of the behaviorally disturbed at Troup 
Junior High in New Haven exposed me, if only on a small scale, 
to the kind of children I deal with at Covenant House. We have 
a policy of open intake, meaning we accept any child who walks 
through our doors: those with a criminal or psychiatric history, 
chronic runaways, abuse cases and the resourceless. 

After seven months, I do not feel burned out. Rather, I am 
forced to examine assumptions about the world I never knew I 
had. For example, my views concerning male-female relation-
ships are constantly challenged here. The only affection many of 
these children have known has been within sexual relationships. 
In fact, Covenant H ouse has a whole floor of mothers and 
b.d>ies. A girl would not get an abortion because her child is all 
she has. 

What I'm doing now I know I can't do forever: the stress fac-
tor is too high and the intensity will wear thin. But I know I have 
made the right decision. M y schooling did not end when I left 
the University. I will continue to learn from children who are 
alone. from those who have nowhere to go. AD I must do is 
listen.
