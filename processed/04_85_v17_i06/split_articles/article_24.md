The article discusses the complexities of Yale's financial aid system, using the "Uniform Methodology."  The author presents a hypothetical scenario of two identical families with different savings, highlighting the system's focus on current financial situation rather than past choices.  Donald Routh, Director of Yale's Financial Aid Office, explains the system's limitations and challenges, such as varying costs of living and the difficulty in assessing individual circumstances.  The article explores the inconsistencies and subjective judgments inherent in the system, even with efforts to create a uniform approach. The article details Yale's use of statistical solutions, such as tables from the National Board of Realtors, to account for fluctuations in real estate values.  Despite these adjustments, the article concludes that the system remains imperfect, requiring continuous reevaluation.
