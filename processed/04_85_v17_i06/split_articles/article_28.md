**Excavation in Mongolia of Velociraptor**
**Page number(s): 40-41**

Excavation in Mongolia of Velo~~raptor 
takes great pride in the Peabody. "As a 
museum, it is excellent. But as a private 
university museum, the Peabody is really 
extraordinary," he said, adding that, un-
fortunately, few members of the Yale 
community take advantage of it. "I like to 
embarass my classes by asking who has 
been to the Peabody. There are actually 
students who don't know that the place 
exists." 

His pride in the museum is the rightful 
pride of a father, for many of the 
Peabody's acquisitions are the results of 
Ostrom's work. Throughout the 1960s 
Ostrom carried out a series of expedi-
tions in the West, particularly Montana 
and Wyoming, bringing back many of 
the specimens that now rest in the 
Peabody's Hall of Dinosaurs. This April, 
Ostrom "pulled a great coup for Yale," 
possibly his greatest. When Princeton 
University announced it was leaving the 
field of vertebrate paleontology, Ostrom 
immediately proposed that Yale could 
best make use of their very valuable col-
lection of fossils. 

The Princeton ad-
ministration agreed. "It's sad," Ostrom 
said, "because they have been a strong-
hold in the area for so long. But this does 
demonstrate how we put priority into 
scholarship and overcome our football 
rivalries. It's the way all academic institu-
tions should treat one another." The fact 
that Yale was competing for Princeton's 
collection with the Smithsonian, the Field 
Museum of Natural History in Chicago, 
the Carnegie Museum and the U niversi-
ty of Michigan, gives Ostrom great 
satisfaction. The collection of over 24,000 
fossils will come to Yale this month, join-
ing the Peabody's already valuable collec-
tion, which includes the original Bron-
tosaurus found and named by Yale's Pro-
fessor O.C. Marsh in the late 1800s. 

In the regions out west where Ostrom 
spent his early career, Yale now has a 
permanent geology field camp. When 
Thomas Stroock, '48, donated a ranch to 
Yale, it was considered an ideal location 
for a base camp for Yale's geology field 
course. To help shoulder the costs of 
maintaining a ranch year-round, Yale 
asked Harvard and Cornell to join the 
project and a three-way foundation was 
created. 

Located 
17 
miles from 
Saratoga, 
Wyoming in the Sierra 
Madre mountains, 
the camp was 
established in 1981 
and has been 
operating for three seasons. 

Ostrom is the only active member 
from Yale on the foundation board, and 
according to some of the students who 
have spent summers there, he is the 
backbone of the camp. Although much 
of Yale's 
geology department has 
become more theoretical, Ostrom is a 
firm believer that "you cannot learn 
geology unless you look at the rocks. 
You can sit in a class and read the text-
books, but until you really get out there 
and get your hands dirty in the field, the 
concepts are not reinforced adequately," 
Ostrom said. 

Debbie Colodner, a 
senior geoiogy major, spent last sum-
mer at the camp and readily agrees with 
Ostrom. "I learned more from that 

"You can tell that he 
really loves the land 
and wishes he could 
be back out there." 

summer at camp than I had the last 
three years of classes," said Colodner. 

Ostrom clearly loves the region, 
speaking of it as "a beautiful forested 
area. It has nice flowing brooks with 
good fishing-reaJiy nice trout," he 
said. However, Ostrom has only been 
able to visit for brief periods recently, 
due to his responsibilities and projects 
here at YaJe. "You can tell that he reaJly 
loves the land and wishes he could be 
back out there," Colodner said. 

Ostrom's 
devotion 
to 
both 
his 
students and his work is obvious in the 
way he speaks of his profession. "After 
having done this for a few years, I 
become more and more stimulated by 
the fact that life is constantly changing, 
that evolution is such a wonderful pro-
cess," Ostrom said. He feels that his 
class, "The History of Life," designed for 
students who do not plan to pursue 
geology or paleontology, is one of the 
most important aspects of his job here. 
"I'm still getting letters from students I 
had four or five years ago who say 'I'm 
so glad I took your course. I see the 
whole world differently,' and that's a 
pretty good feeling to have," he said. "I 
reaJiy believe that the only way to get a 
perspective on your own life is to look at 
life of the past. We are only here for a 
fleeting moment, as part of an enor-
mous panorama. We live only in one 
smaJI miiJenium, on a speck of dust, in 
all of the universe," said Ostrom, 
removing his glasses and reclining 
against a cabinet. "When you start to 
think about that, you ~gin to reaJize 
that life is a marvelous phenomenon."
