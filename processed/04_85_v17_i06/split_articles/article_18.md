"The stereotype of Yale in the 1950s as a 
bunch of prep school kids whose fathers 
went to Yale had a lot of truth to it," 
remembered Worth David, dean of 
undergraduate admissions. "There were 
a lot of guys here who were looking to 
coast through college playing sports and 
having a good time before landing a job 
with a New York brokerage firm." 

Change came in the 1960s. With the 
support 
of then-President 
Kingman 
Brewster, Dean of Admissions Insley 
Clark trimmed the percentage of private 
school students, opened Yale to women, 
accepted more minority applicants and 
rejuvenated emphasis on academic ability. According to Clark, the rationale for 
these changes was quite simple. "The student body was not diversified enough nor 
intellectually strong enough to make Yale 
the national and international resource it 
ought to be." 

Today's Admissions Office tries to 
follow Clark's guidelines. "The admissions 
process consists of taking the kids 
with the strongest academic records," 
David said, "then consciously trying to 
put a diverse class together. We don't 
want a class with 1300 history majors." 

But 'diversity' is a nebulous and provocative 
term 
that 
must somehow 
translate into specific policies. Now, it 
often boils down to the special consideration given to three groups who comprise 
only one-third of the total applicant pool: 
legacies, 
under-represented minority 
groups and athletes. 

Of course, extraordinary musical and 
artistic ability are part of the admissions 
equation, and David considers geographical 
diversity a particularly important 
asset 
as 
well. 
"There are some 
geographical differences which TV and 
other factors haven't wiped out. New 
England and Southern kids still look at 
things quite differently." 

Roughly the first 1000 strongest applicants breeze through the admissions 
process with "little or no discussion.

There's an academic minimum that a 
student be able to do Yale work, and in 
most cases a minimum standard of social 
or extra-curricular ability," David explained. "Academic promise alone is not 
in most cases enough to get a student into 
Yale. We want to be able to find the kid a 
roommate." 

But once these students are admitted, 
there are still thousands more applications for the Admissions Committee to 
consider and 
about 
another 
1000 
students to be accepted. At this stage of 
the process, it begins to matter whether a 
student's father or mother went to Yale, 
whether an applicant is a member of a 
minority group and whether an applicant 
shows the ability and the desire to play a 
varsity sport. 

Legacies are the group most privileged 
by the Admissions Office, with a stable 
acceptance rate of about 40 percent. 
"Around the Ivies the standard admit 
rate for legacies is twice the rate of other 
applicants," David noted. "Of the groups 
which 
receive 
special consideration, 
legacies have the strongest conventional 
qualifications, probably because of income, family values and the like." 

Although David termed legacies "about 
as qualified" as their classmates here, he 
did admit that they sometimes are not on 
par with other Yalies. 

Despite this fact, legacies are accepted 
to Yale at such a high rate because 
they- or more accurately their parents-
are essential to the University's financial 
welfare. Director of Development Terry 
Holcombe, '64, spends much of his time 
"keeping alumni 
happy." 
Holcombe 
pointed out, "Since the late 1960s Yale 
has had to depend heavily on gifts to sustain itself. Inky Clark's changes bred a 
whole generation of disappointed 
parents." 

While most of the alumni are used to 
seeing roughly a fifth of each class reserved for the sons and daughters of 
Yale, Holcombe still gets phone calls
