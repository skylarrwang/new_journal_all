Taped to the door on the second floor 
landing of Dwight Hall is an orange piece 
of construction paper with the hand-
printed words, "New Haven CISPES: 
Committee in Solidarity with the People 
of El Salvador." Inside, old chairs and 
couches are arranged in a circle. 
Although empty, the room still speaks to 
the visitor. Arrayed on every wall are 
posters and bumper stickers. Some pro-
test 
U.S. involvement in Central 
America: "El Salvador, the People will 
Win," "Stop the Bombing in El Salvador" 
and "U.S. out of Central America." 
Others are reminders of past events: 
"Coffee with Milk," "Dance Party" and 
"Holly Near and 
Ronnie Gilbert." 
Underneath large maps of El Salvador 
Nicaragua are photographs of 
Nicaraguan children. 
Born in 
1981 
as an informal 
undergraduate study group, CISPES is 
one of many New Haven organizations 
critical of U.S. involvement in Latin 
America. Registered with Dwiglu Hall, 
CISPES has 35 members, including city 
residents, alumni, faculty, graduate 
students and undergraduates. Originally 
concerned with the struggle in 
E1 
Salvador, the group has focused most 
recently on Nicaragua as well. CISPES 
calls for popular rule in Central America, 
it 
implements this 
belief in 
democracy within itself: CISPES has no 
president, no heirarchy. With letters to 
Congressmen and rallies, the group con-
stantly asks the U.S. government to re-
examine its role in the region. Moreover, 
CISPES works within El Salvador and 
Nicaragua, funding both medical relief 
and community projects, attempting to 
restore order in war-torn areas. 
"We share a common belief that U.S. 
intervention is not useful for the U.S. or 
for the region," said Alicia Fernandes, 
'83, a founder of the study group."We 
definitely believe mass struggles should 
be supported." From its earliest stages, 
CISPES has been a political supporter of 
the Salvadoran FDR-FMLN, an alliance 
of the political party, the Democratic 
Revolutionary Front (FDR) and the 
guerilla faction, Frente Farabundo Marti 
de Liberacion (FMLN). Viewing FDR-
FMLN as the legitimate voice of the 
Salvadoran people, CISPES shows its 
support for the coalition by trying to 
educate the Yale and New Haven com-
munities. The group shows films and 
presents speakers, revealing FDR-
FMLN's struggles against the repressive 
Salvadoran government and military. 
Although CISPES does not support 
the alliance fmancially, it does raise 
money for a medical relief fund in FDR-
FMLN-held regions of El Salvador. 
CISPES contends it can only provide aid 
to civilians through such a fund, because 
relief sent to government-controlled areas 
would probably never reach the injured. 
More likely, the funds would be con-
fiscated by the government, or the doc-
tors who received them would be ar-
rested for engaging in subversive activity. 
Most recently, funds raised have been 
channeled into the Salvadoran Medical 
Relief Fund run by a U.S. medic, Dr. 
Charles Clements. He went to El 
Salvador after seeing the effects of the 
bombs he had dropped as a pilot in Viet-
nam. Wishing to treat the most severely 
injured, Clements chose to work in FDR-
FMLN areas, prime bombing targets for 
the Salvadoran Army. "The Salvadoran 
army is using a 'scorch earth policy.' It is 
destroying villages that it thinks support 
guerillas," said English Professor Richard 
Halpern, who was the frrst graduate stu-
dent to join CISPES. "The war effort is 
not against the guerillas because the 
army can't pin them down. The only war 
that they can wage is against the civilian 
infrastructure. And the civilian casualties 
have been high. It's been documented
