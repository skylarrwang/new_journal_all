sell his second home. The student re-
called, "Their路 attitude was, 'Yale is a 
hardship. Act like it's a hardship."' But 
Routh shook his head and explained, 
"The Uniform Methodology has to make 
some assumptions about what standard 
. of living is appropriate for families asking 
for 路rmancial aid. That system assumes 
one house. We don't make a personal 
judgment that they shouldn't have a se-
cond home, but we do make ajudgment 
that they shouldn't expect more fmancial 
aid because of it." 
Stephen Knight, SY '87, has an even 
more complex problem. His father, an 
Episcopal minister, recently moved from 
California to Hawaii and purchased a 
very expensive new home. Upon seeing 
the price of his home on Knight's fman路 
cial aid application, Yale revoked his 
financial aid award. The Knight family 
claims that the new home does not repre-
sent any change in income, but rather in-
sists that most of the new home was paid 
for by the church and the sale of the old 
home, while the rest required a large 
mortgage, which the family must now 
repay. Routh asked, "Did the family 
need a home of that magnitude? If the 
problem was that they were suddenly 
obliged to use all of their resources to 
support a parent in a nursing home, we 
would have been more sympathetic. 
However, since they knew that it was a 
time in their lives when they should be 
providing education for their children, 
I'm trying to understand a little better 
how they come to buy that kind of home. 
Families must make certain decisions 
about standards of living when their 
children go to Yale." Knight is threaten-
ing to withdraw from Yale and the fman-
cial aid department is continuing its in-
vestigation of the situation. 
In these cases the issues are not clear路 
cut. Yale is a hardship for many families 
who have to make sacrifices. But when 
that means not buying the house that 
they want, having to sell a retirement 
home or forcing one parent to look for a 
higher paying job, the high tuition may 
cause parents to regret sending their

children to Yale in the f~rst place. One 
junior recalled, "When I go home, it's just 
one constant hassle about how much Yale 
costs. My folks want me to accelerate a 
semester just to save the money." 
Even without parental pressure 
students often run into monetary dif-
ficulties at Yale, especially with the re-
quirement that they work both during 
the school year and over the summer. 
John Morrell, BK '86 noted, "You strug-
gle to earn $1400 during the year, and 
when you get out, that's peanuts. I'd 
rather have all that time to do more 
things while I have the opportunity to do 
them at Yale, but I'm already going to be 
$10,000 in debt." 
Other students disagreed. 
Darius 
Helm, a junior in Morse who works part-
time for a solar-paneling f1rm, said, 
"Some people aren't as rich as other peo-
ple are, and there's no reason why they 
should be. There are good jobs available 
and you can work on your own time. The 
dining halls pay twice as much for 
washing dishes as the same job would in a 
New Haven restaurant."
