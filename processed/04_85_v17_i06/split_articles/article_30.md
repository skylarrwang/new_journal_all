invasion in 1972. Other times he found 
it hard to watch students waving a 
:-.;orth Vietnamese banner. Said Fuller, 
"People seemed to think this was a 
match in which U.S. failure would 
somehow lead to humane results." H e 
makes no intentional political statement 
in Fragmnzts on the propriety of U .S. in-
volvement in Vietnam. But he does 
make a personal statement, one ad-
dressed to anyone who would self-
righteously reduce the question of 
behavior in Vietnam to a simple right 
or wrong. In combat. morality becomes 
equivocal. "Soldiers were thrown into 
tragic situations where decisions made 
in a split-second might come back to 
haunt them endlessly," Fuller said. 
"And then there is the idea of respon-
siblity and freedom linked to thi central 
ambiguity ... because it's hard to ex-
cuse one's own self when the facts alone 
don't explain what you did.~ Fra(!mmts is 
Fuller's absolution for every American 
soldier who ever found that a rational 
account o f the facts fell short of supply-
ing an explanation for what had hap-
pened to him. But it also means to <:how 
those 
soldiers that ultimate!} 
the 
responsibility for their actions dors lie 
with them selves. Although this respon-
sibility is fraught with moral ambiguity. 
Fuller believes that accepting it is an 
assertion of one's freedom. 
In Fragmnrts, 
~forgan is like the 
many soldiers who continuallv try to 
find concrete explanations for \"hat has 
happened. He looks to the circum-
stances that man cannot control to find 
the<:e . explanations, hoping they will 
serve to absolve people of their respon-
siblity. For Morgan the controlling 
forces in Vietnam are "chance and 
necessity. That was all there was to it. 
As much as you hated the odds, hated 
the brute, amoral powers of the jungle, 
you had to cling to them. They left no 
room for blame." Once he comes home, 
Morgan 
fights 
with 
all 
unanswered quc'ltions in his memory of 
Xuan The. The facts he has, the 
fragments, do not fit together into a 
w holt·. do not make the connections 
that would free Neumann of rc pon-
sibility. Although in the final s ene of 
the novel Morgan has all the informa-
tion from Neumann that he had not 
previously known, his desire to <,um up 
the event, to put it on the shdf under 
the heading "Chance and 1'\ecessity," is 
ultimately frustrated. Neumann cannot 
be absolved; the responsibilty is his. 
Acknowledging this, the reader will 
have to make his own estimation of the 
moralitv invoh ed. if anv at all. 
One ·might easily su'spect there is 
a strong autobiographical relation be-
tween the author and Morgan. But 
Fuller explained that he wanted to 
separate his characters from himself as 
much as possible in order to maintain a 
more objective critical eye. Perhaps 
Fuller created Morgan as a link be-
tween himself and those who did not go 
to Vtetnam, those for whom he wrote 
hts I q71 article. The last line of the 
nO\el belongs to ~forgan : .. And if I 
wept at all. it \.,as not for the dead." His 
education is the reader's education. If 
w<' gain a better understanding of what 
happt·ned to Amencans in Vietnam 
from Fra(mmls. thl'n our compassion. 
thic; time. goes to those who 'urvived.
