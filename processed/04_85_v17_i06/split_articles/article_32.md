EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Davis thoughtfully concludes, "This 
abstracted concern for human rights 
ran counter to the normal assumptions 
and procedures of law and has hardly 
been a prominent theme in human 
history." 

Moving beyond Great Britain, Davis 
explores the years after English eman· 
cipation, which he terms "a century of 
progress." Britain's example 
forced 
much of the rest of the world to recon· 
sider its moral stance on slavery; no 
country which wished to be progressive 
could permit slavery within its borders. 
No longer would governments and 
churches worldwide speak of the "pro-
gressive" nature of slavery and expect to 
hear praise for their morality. 

But Davis ends on a disturbing note, 
asking whether slavery has really disap-
peared from the world or simply taken 
new forms. He points to labor camps in 
the USSR, Jews forced to work in fac-
tories in World War II Germany and 
the oppression of indigenous peasants 
in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Clearly 
Davis feels that the 20th century has not 
rid itself of the forced use of human 
labor. 

Slavery and Human Progress is an im-
pressive book, though not without its 
flaws. In many instances the awesome 
scope of Davis's study -literally, the 
history of recorded civilization- makes 
it impossible for him to examine his 
subject as thoroughly as it merits. There 
are instances where his treatment of 
issues is glaringly superficial, most 
noticeably in his examination of eman-
cipation in France and Brazil. 

But to •his credit, Davis makes no 
claims of being able to do justice to all 
this information, and therefore much of 
the book has an informal, almost 
talkative tone. Davis seems more con· 
cerned with raising qu.estions of morali-
ty and progress than with answering 
them, an approach which has left some 
academic critics dissatisfied, but works 
for the reader who prefers a candid ap-
proach toward issues of morality rather · 
than a dry and apparently omniscient 
historical treatise. In Slavery and Human 
Progress, David Brion Davis proves that 
he has the breadth of knowledge to at· 
tempt a study as immense as this. Even 
more impressively, he demonstrates the 
intellectual honesty to admit that no in· 
dividual can answer the disturbing 
question of how men could enslave 
other men, all in the name of progress.

As both white and black abolitionists discovered, emancipation could be even 
mOI'e effectively blocked by men who believed in progress than by those who 
fatalisticaDy resigned themselves to the sins of this world .... To speak of the 
idea of progress as an oiJstDcll to emancipation may be troubling for people who 
would like to translate aD historical problems into binary choices . . . U nfor· 
tunattely, the problems we are exploring are much too complicated for yes-or-no 
answers. This is not to say that muddy thinking can be justifw:d by references to 
6fe's oonc:lusions. For thoee of us who still think of history as a kind of moral 
phibophy teaching tiy examples. it is precisely the moral character of 
truth-the varied 8IJ8Ies of vision that are also the subject of imaginative 
literature-that cne must seek to capture. If such inquiry has any 'therapeutic' 
value, it arises from the diac:overy that the most comforting and reassuring 
facets ol meaning ... are not the only dimensions of historical experience.
