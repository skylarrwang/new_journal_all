"'CIA Out" Rally on Cross Campus 
Gehman heard about the redevelopment 
project in which CISPES is now involved. 
The Sandinista Committee wanted to 
build a community center on the out-
skirts of town which would lodge a 
nursery, meeting hall and health clinic. 
Although the community could supply 
the labor, the building supplies and the 
space, 
it lacked 
funds because the 
government itself did not initiate the pro-
ject. "When I told the coordinator how 
we (CISPES) might raise the money they 
needed by giving parties, she told me a 
very telling thing. She said that they used 
to hold fundraising parties, but now they 
can't because they are in constant fear of 
attack from the contras. They have to be 
on alert at all times," Gettman said. So 
far, CISP ES has raised $700 of the SlOOO 
~~ pledged and hopes to complete the pro-
Ject by early summer. 

Along 
with such solidarity work, 
CISPES also engages in anti-intervention 
activities, attempting to influence the 
government's Central America policy 
d~ions. The group has organized bus 
tnps to rallies in Washington to protest 
U.S. involvement in Nicaragua. The last 
March on Washington on November 12, 
1983 saw a New Haven contingent that 
filled six buses. "It was a huge organizing 
effort and it was very successful," Fer-
nandes said. "To have 300 people commit 
$27 and one day and a night is a big state-
ment." 

Last month, C ISPES completed its 
Contra Contra Campaign. The group col-
lected signatures and held letter-writing 
campaigns to C onnecticut Congressmen, 
urging them to vote against the release of 
$14 million in suspended C IA funds for 
the contras. "Whether you believe the con-
tras commit atrocmes, whether you 
disagree 
with 
U.S. intervention or 
whether you support the Nicaraguan 
government, it doesn't really matter. You 
can still support our position against 
funding them (the contras)," said Eric 
Arnesen, a ftfth year graduate student of 
Afro-American and labor history. "We 
want the Congressmen to know that they 
aren't going out on a limb when they vote 
against the aid. We want to give them the 
confidence to vote and to let them know 
they have support in their constituency." 

Arnesen joined C ISP ES two years ago 
during the he ightening of U.S. involve-
ment in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Since 
then, he has devoted a great deal of time 
working for the group- his C ISPES 
responsibilities share priority with his 
dissertation and his teaching. Arnesen's 
commitment to C ISPES and its prin-
ciples permeates his speech, his emphatic 
gestures and his clothing. The words 
"Solidaridad con El Salvador" and the im-
age of two Indian women, one with a 
raised clenched fist, is visible on the pur-
ple t-shirt he wears. 

Arnesen and other members apply 
their political p rinciples not only to their 
work in Central America, but to the 
organization itself. As part of its commit-
ment to democracy, CISP ES actively 
supports fem inism. 
Women always 
represent the group at public events. 
Said 
Fernandes, "Women 
represen-
tatives are good for C ISP ES internally. 
Women who come to the events see that 
not all politicos are male. We show that 
women are assertive and politically active

about issues other than 'women's issues.'" 

Often fundraisers attempt to inform 
the audience about both Central America 
and feminism. The Holly Near/Ronnie 
Gilbert concert proved successful because 
of the large feminist turnout from the 
surrounding area, since both singers are 
well-known feminists. The Sabia concert 
featured a group which sang leftist and 
feminist songs in Spanish. "It was really 
exciting speaking to a feminist audience 
about C ISPES' projects at the Holly 
Near concert," 
Minkowitz said. 
"Feminists around here are the ones who 
happen to be the most activist because 
they have been organized for a long time 
already. It's good to talk to a group about 
Central America that is already politi-
cized." 

As part of their belief in equality, 
CISPES has 
neither 
officers 
nor 
bureaucracy. "In terms of ranks, there 
aren't any distinctions made. Students 
are considered adults. If there is a heirar-
chy at all-and I don't think there IS-it's 
with vears of membership to CISPES," 
said Renaissance Studies DUS Susanne 
Wofford. Formerly a member of the 
Yale Faculty Committee on Central 
America, 
Wofford joined CISPES 
because she wanted to "''ork with a more 
diverse and active group of people. 

Because there is no presic!c:nt, members 
volunteer to chair the weekly Monday 
evening meetings, while others take notes 
or time discussions. The "rotating chair" 
guarantees continuity through gradua-
tions and the constant addition of ne"' 
members. Newcomers can observe the 
more experienced members as they run 
meetings before they volunteer to chair 
one themselves. 

Although devoted to action, CISPES 
strongly 
believes 
in 
self-education 
through observation, reading and discus· 
sion. "We operate on the assumption that 
what has brought a person to us is a con-
cern, not a lot of previous knowledge," 
Wofford said. To learn more about cur-
rent political and social events in Latin 
CISPES 
members 
meet 
regularly as a study group. The member 
who volunteers to lead the self-education 
session assigns articles for reading and 
discussion. In these sessions, members 
examine everything from the situation of 
women in Nicaragua to the policies of the 
FDR-FMLN, from land reform to 
homosexual rights. 

The Monday evening meetings pro-
cede from a ney.-s summary and lll'lalysis 
of Latin American concerns to reports 
from each of the four committees and 
concludes with a period of "critlself-crit." 
Conducted without time constraints, this 
period allows members to discuss what 
went well during the meeting, what went 
poorly, 
how 
individuals conducted 


"We operate on the 
assumption that what 
has brought a person 
to us is a concern, not 
a lot of previous 
knowledge." 

themselves, whether anyone made 
statements that were chauvinistic on 
either a national or personal level. "Many 
of us feel that we're in this conflict for the 
long haul," Arnesen said, referring to 
their conflict with U.S. government 
policies. "So we have to be able to work 
together and to talk to each other honest-
ly." 

People sit on the chairs and couches, on 
the table tops and floor, listening to an ru:• 
count of the week's news in Nicaragua. A 
friendly dog who answers to the name 
Sandinista makes his rounds to be pet-
ted. Professor Halpern looks at the watch 
in his hands and reminds Geltman that 
there are five minutes left. Geltman sug-
gellts that the group move on to news 
from FJ Salvador. "A Congressional 
caucus accused the administration of sup-
plying 'insufficient, misleading and, in 
some cases, false information' on FJ -
Salvador. The caucus stated that twice 
the supposedly 55 U.S. officials are pre-
sent in FJ Salvador and that U.S. person-
~1 go on patrols under frre, target bomb 
sttes and maintain equipment. State and 
Defense department officials had no 
comment
