Africa on Orange Street 
A black grate covers the front of a shop 
on Orange Street, almost concealing 
white 
letters which 
read: 
Botanicas 
Chango #5. Within, shelves are lined 
with hundreds of miniature bottles con-
taining infinitely-hued perfumes, bath. 
oils and incense. 
Atop glass-fronted 
cabinets sit large, plastic statues: a silver 
cobra, 
a 
Roman piUar, a laughing 
Buddha. OccassionaJ mirrored bar signs 
flash 
brightly between a myriad of 
religious plaques and cruciftxes. There 
appears a 
vague 
division 
between 
religious goods, for which Botanicas 
Chango #5 advertizes itself, and seem-

ingly trivial, five-and-dime-store 
paraphernalia. This semester the store 
became an optional term paper assign-
ment for Timothy Dwight Master 
Robert Thompson's class, From West 
Africa to the Black Americas: tht Black Atlantic 
Visual Tradition, solely because of its 
religious content. 
"My interest in the store," Thompson 
said, "is that it reflects the religious icons 
of the Yoruba of Nigeria." Botanicas 
Chango #5 demonstrates the blending of 
Yoruban 
images 
with 
Roman 
Catholicism, and Thompson, 
who 
discovered the store while walking down 
Orange Street, "was very interested to 
see this Nro-American process taking 
place literally a few blocks from Yale."

Botanicas Chango #5 is greatly in-
fluenced by Spanish culture. The locked 
cabinets which surround the rectangular 
room are neatly filled with silver charms, 
jewelry, books on dreams, hair-care 
items and games. Cassettes and record 
albums, along with wedding invitations, 
Hallmark cards· and 
weU-thumbed 
novelettes, are all in Spani~h. juan juan, 
the owner from Mallorca, Spain, took the 
shop over from his cousin two years ago. 
Juan owes much of his patronage to 
Anne Kordorsky, a religious woman who 
is at the store every weekday around four 
p.m. Kordorsky belongs to a New York 
religious group that combines West 
African religions with Catholicism. She 
has a regular group of "clients" who visit · 
her at the store or at her home for advice 
and for the special bath oils or incense, 
among other materials she prescribes. "A 
lot of times they go to the doctor and he 
can't fmd anything," she said with a 
heavy Puerto Rican accent, "so they 
come and I give them something." She 
stresses, though, that a person's religion 
does not matter to her. "Everyone, they 
come privately." 
The uniqueness of Botanicas Chango 
15 prompted Melissa Park, MC '88, a 
member of Thompson's class, to visit it. 
"When you walk in cold," Park said, "you 
probably just see plastic ligures, vials and 
beads ... But there's so much more, 
there's history and culture that goes back 
centuries. It's exciting because• you're 
touching something that links past to 
present through various cultures and 
religions."
