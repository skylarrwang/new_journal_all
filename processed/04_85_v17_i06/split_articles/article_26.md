President Giamatti, a Canadian citizen, was unable to get aid from the Quebecois government partly because the "separatist government wasn't particularly interested in subsidizing an English-speaking student at an American university." When he told Yale that he would not be receiving this aid, Yale recommended he "ask again politely," although Hyder knew that the political situation made the effort almost completely futile.


Due to politics, bureaucracy, and postal systems, it took almost a full year for Hyder to receive financial aid. He explained, "The delay was both completely unnecessary, and completely predictable to anyone who knew anything at all about Canadian politics."


Hyder's earlier difficulties receiving enough financial aid led in part to his decision to take two years off from Yale. He attributed his problems to the department's limited knowledge of the particular problems of foreign students, and noted, "They don't keep abreast of the Canadian dollar, and the different taxation policies, or they don't appear to. Most Canadian students at Yale are quite wealthy, because average Canadian students can't even think about coming here. Yale just doesn't offer them enough money. I'm back because my father has a new job."


But the use of averages to analyze the situations of individuals, the bureaucratic confusions and the paradoxes they create are not unique to Yale. Some form of the Uniform Methodology is used to determine need at most universities, and many policies are common among all the members of the Ivy League, a group formed expressly to insure that no students, and no athletes in particular, would choose one school over another on the basis of financial aid policies. Until recently all Ivy League schools held to an "aid-blind" admissions policy and offered to meet the full financial needs of all who were accepted. Brown and Dartmouth no longer make these claims.


Recognizing the difficulty of providing the one million dollars worth of financial aid that Yale must come up with every year, Morrel confessed, "Complaining about financial aid is like looking a gift horse in the mouth. But almost everyone has some problem with it_" Others remain mystified by what seems from the outside to be a completely arbitrary process. One student noted, "Every year they come up with some figure that we're supposed to pay, and it never seems to have any relationship to how much money we really have. So every year we have to figure out a new way to pay it."


Some students are so wary of the financial aid department's authority that they were reluctant or unwilling to discuss their difficulties.


But behind this desire not to rock the boat lie some very serious anxieties about the future of financial aid at Yale. This winter, the Reagan administration indicated that student loan programs may no longer be immune from budget cuts, leading to speculation that Yale will have to reconsider its full financial aid policy. The proposed budget cuts could seriously alter the status of any student receiving a federal loan. Denying rumors of future policy changes, Routh stated, "No suggestion has been made that this is even a remote possibility. We are concerned but are not panicking and do not plan to change our policy." The Yale Corporation itself has assured Routh that the policy of providing full financial aid is in no danger of being abolished and will continue to be a University priority. Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti recently spoke against cuts in the student loan programs before a Congressional subcommittee, and stated at last week's rally against the aid cuts that the government policy reversal "would turn back a fundamental tie that has run through American history ... the principle that access to America in the fullest and best sense of the word is through education on one's merit."


But Yale's financial aid department remains caught in a double bind. On the one hand, it will always be subject to the will of budget writers both within and outside of the University. On the other hand, its own bureaucracy and even its unavoidable demands upon students create difficulties for them and their families. Any student whose individual situation deviates from pre-established norms may find him or herself in conflict with a financial aid officer who must make decisions about the student's finances according to what may be purely subjective criteria, or at least criteria which differ from the student's own values. With 80 percent of Yale undergraduates working, borrowing and receiving gift aid from Yale, the financial aid department cannot afford to become any less concerned with the particular problems of individual students, especially if the level of government commitment to students begins to change. Otherwise, Yale's price tag will again dictate who can attend Yale and who cannot even consider applying.
