One Man's War 
Jay Carney 
"How could I make someone under-
stand the difference between morality 
and what happens to a man's soul when 
he leaps out of a helicopter on a combat 
assault?" wrote Jack Fuller in an article 
entitled "Getting Back to the Garden" in 
the April 1971 issue of The New journal. 
In the article, Fuller described his post-
Vietnam impressions of Yale and the 
"War at Home." 

"How could I relate ethics to the smell 
of carnage and cordite?" the article con-
tinued. "That would take a novel to 
do ... " That summer Fuller began 
writing his novel about Vietnam. In 
1984, after 13 years of writing and 
revising, Fragments was published. 

Although Fuller took over a decade to 
complete it, Fragments does not seem 
overworked. It is neither long, nor detail-
ed with factual historical references; nor 
does it have a complex plot. But what it 
does have is an immediacy that draws the 
reader into one experience of being in 
Vietnam and Cambodia during wartime. 
The prose is simple; even descriptive 
sentences are short and to the point. The 
author uses this compressed style to 
maintain tight control over the novel's 
fmely tuned characters and their inter-
relationships. Fuller leaves little ambigui-
ty about the kind of person each 
character should represent to the reader. 
Although this aspect of Fuller's style can 
make some of the novefs sequences a bit 
predictable, 
the author ultimately 
manipulates this predictability to make 
the most significant events more surpris-
ing and effective. 

Fuller draws the 
material 
for 
Fragments from his own experience in 
Vietnam. After one semester at Yale 
Law School in 1968, he was drafted into 
the U.S Army for two years, the second 
of which he spent as a combat cor-
respondent for Stars and Stripts. Fuller 
spent his year in the field with the 
"grunts," the ground infantrymen. He

got to know these men well because, 
like their civilian counterparts, cor-
respondents for Stars and Stnpes never 
carried weapons: they depended on 
grunts for protection. 

Fragments is about the grunts and the 
experiences Fuller had with them. The 
novel reads like a fresh account of non-
fiction. The two central characters are 
Bill Morgan, a careful thinker who 
looks to the facts to find the reason, and 
Jim Neumann, M organ's new friend 
and hero. Told by Morgan, a college 
graduate of the class of '68, the novel 
opens at the end of the story. M organ 
and others report to an official inquiry 
into Neumann's actions during a skir-
mish with the enem y near the village of 
Xuan The. Civilians had been killed, 
but Neumann is absolved because no 
one but he can say exactly what hap-
pened there. Then Morgan takes us to 
the beginning, to when he received his 
draft notice, began basic training, and 
first met Neumann. From here, Fuller 
carefull y 
develops 
the reader's 
understanding of the characters, their 
friendship 
and 
their circumstances 
before they reach Xuan The. This is the 
site of the novel's central event, the 
place where Fuller demonstrates the 
"difference between morality and what 
happens to a man's soul when he leaps 
out of a helicopter on a combat assault." 

The bitterness Fuller had felt when 
he returned to Yale in 1971 had driven 
him to write his article. What he could 
not communicate there, he chose to ex-
plain in a novel. But isn't it too early to 
turn into fiction an era whose facts are 
still a matter of heated debate? And isn't 
the inevitable result a romanticizing of 
even the most horrible of events? Clear-
ly, Fuller does not think so. The at-
titudes he encountered when he re-
turned from Vietnam could not be 
enlightened by more factual informa-
tion. As he did then, Fuller still belie~es

that fiction is best suited to convey his 
message about Vietnam. "Everyone had 
their own glib moral assertions to make 
about a soldier's responsibilty for his ac-
tions in Vietnam." he explained recent-
ly. "One thing that had struck me was 
how difficult it was to make any simple 
historical judgement on the event, both 
when I was there and after I had come 
back. And that's why it was so irritating 
that 
others' assumptions 
were 
so 
simple ... " 

Fuller remembered particular events 
at Yale that revealed to him disturbing 
misperceptions about the war. One 
night some law school students watch-
ing the news were cheering "as though it 
had been a H arvard-Yale game" when 
the North Vietnamese Army crossed a 
demilitarized zone during a large-scale
