EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Gilbert Garcia, BR '85, a Latino from El Paso, Texas, explained his role in Yale's minority recruitment program.  He described his work as more of a friend than a recruiter, aiming to help prospective students gain admission to a four-year college, even if it's not Yale.  His efforts involve contacting prospective students, college counselors, and parents to address concerns and encourage applications.  He helps students with their essays and ensures they have backup school options.  He also aims to dispel the concerns of parents about their children losing their ethnic identity.  The article also discusses the challenges and controversies surrounding Yale's admissions process, including the economic disparity among accepted minority students and the limited reach of their recruitment efforts.  The program includes 40 undergraduate volunteer recruiters who travel home to recruit other minorities over Thanksgiving.
