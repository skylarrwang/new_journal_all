that both napalm and white phosphorous 
bombs are being used by the Salvadoran 
army." To date, CISPES has contributed 
to the Fund over $13,000 from the HoUy 
Near/ Ronnie Gilbert concert last year 
and over S800 from the Sabia concert this 
March. 
Through the Fund, membt'rs feel they 
repair, if only in some small way, the 
damage inflicted by U.S. backed forces. 
"If the U.S. gives aid that hurts the peo-
ple," Donna Minkowitz, CC '85, said, 
"we want to counteract it and give aid 
that helps them. So, if the U.S. provides 
the bombs, we want tO provide medical 
aid."

While CISPES provides relief through 
a third party in El Salvador, it has 
become much more directly involved in 
Nicaragua. CISPES recognizes the San-
dinista government, although the U.S. 
supports rebel groups, known as contras, 
who wish to overthrow it. In Nicaragua 
the organization performs solidarity 
work: building community facilities and 
funding agricultural projects. 
In a small Nicaraguan town called San 
Ignacio, hidden in the hills on the Pacific 
coast, a small winding dirt road leads past 
the three or four ramshackle homes that 
comprise the center of town, past the 
small school and health post built by the 
Sandinistas, to another dirt path. The 
trail leads to a building in an open field 
with cows grazing nearby, the rural 
work-study school built by the San-
dinistas. Here, 135 grade schoolers learn 
to cultivate crops and to dairy farm. 
When CISPES member John Adler, '84, 
visited San Ignacio two summers ago, the 
Sandinistas had completed the construc-
tion of the school but had no funds to buy 
cows. Consequently, the schoolchildren 
had no milk to drink. Through several 
fundraising events, coffeehouses and 
dances, CISPES raised $1000, enough 
money to buy five cows for the school.

ject in Ocotal, one of the largest north-
ernmost Nicaraguan cities, located ten 
kilometers from the Honduran border. 
The city has a long history of struggle 
against U.S.-backed forces, dating back 
to 1927 when Agusto Sandino's army at-
tacked U.S. Marines stationed there. 
Because the region has remained a San-
dinista stronghold, it is oft!!n assaulted by 
the contras. Last year, Ocotal was attacked 
three times, the most recent of these 
raids destroying the regional grainary, 
sawmill, coffee mill and radio station. 
Working in a mental health clinic out· 
side !'vtanagua, CISPES member David 
Geltman, CC '85, visited Ocotal las{ 
summer. "I met with someone on a bus 
who invited me to the city. On my re-
turn, I spent a week in the house of a 
woman coordinator of a Sandinista 
Defense Committee (a mass organization 
with chapters in every neighborhood)," 
Gettman said. During the course of his 
conversations with
