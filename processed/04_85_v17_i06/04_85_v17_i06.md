Naming Names 
To the Editor: 
I read your Special Issue, March 1, 
with great interest. I began at Yale the 
fall of 1977, in the new Special Student 
Program and therefore constituted both 
a female and older student participating 
in a "neW' and "nearly neW' situation at 
the University. 
I will graduate this May with the Class 
of '85 at the age of 50, part of another 
"frrst" for Yale-the B.L.S. degree 
(Bachelor of Liberal Arts). 
I have 
witnessed many positive changes for the 
undergraduate woman at Yale, both 
young and old during this eventful 
time. 
I recognized many friends among the 
names of female graduates on your 
cover. However the names of the four 
women receiving B.L.S. degree on May 
24th were not included in the Class of'85. 
This relieves me of any anxiety I 
may have had, that as a female, and 
older I was somehow conspicuous at 
Yale. 
Yours truly, 
Beverly Criley Graham, '85 

Edilor's Note: 
The New Journal apologizes for any 
oversights and errors 
on 
our cover. 
Unfortunately, a more accurate list of senior 
women was not aJXZiJable to us.


**Announcements**

Announcements 
Last September, former Editor-in-Chief 
Tina Kelley submitted issues of The New 
journal, dating from September, 1983 to 
April, 1984, for review by the Columbia 
Scholastic Press 
Association. 
In 
February, 7ne New journal received CoJ· 
urnbia's Silver Crown Award, having 
earned 987 points from a possible 1000. 
We thank Columbia for their recogni· 
tion. 
The New Journal would also like to 
thank the Gannett Foundation and the 
Gannett Outdoor Company of Connec-
ticut for their generous grant in support 
of the special issue on fifteen years of 
coeducation at Yale.


**Clarification**
**Page number(s): 5**

Clarification 
In the March 1 issue of The NewJouT'TUll, 
the photo of Lisa Melfi and the women's 
crew team on page 56 was mistakenly 
credited to Pearl Hu. The photographer 
was Carter Brooks. The New Journal 
apologizes for this error. 
In "A Different Ballgame," the river on 
which the crew teams practice was 
mistakenly identified as the Derby. The 
river is the H~usatonic; Derby is the 
name of the town. Also, Nancy Harthun 
is TC '87. 
In "The Compleat Cartoonist," 
Pamela Boynton's middle child was 
mistakenly identified. His name is Keith. 
In "The Tenure Gap," Professor of 
Philosophy Ruth Marcus stated that the 
comparative literature department had 
not tenured women faculty members. 
Margaret 
Ferguson 
and 
Barbara 
Johnson were given tenure by the 
department in 1984.

Africa on Orange Street 
A black grate covers the front of a shop 
on Orange Street, almost concealing 
white 
letters which 
read: 
Botanicas 
Chango #5. Within, shelves are lined 
with hundreds of miniature bottles con-
taining infinitely-hued perfumes, bath. 
oils and incense. 
Atop glass-fronted 
cabinets sit large, plastic statues: a silver 
cobra, 
a 
Roman piUar, a laughing 
Buddha. OccassionaJ mirrored bar signs 
flash 
brightly between a myriad of 
religious plaques and cruciftxes. There 
appears a 
vague 
division 
between 
religious goods, for which Botanicas 
Chango #5 advertizes itself, and seem-

ingly trivial, five-and-dime-store 
paraphernalia. This semester the store 
became an optional term paper assign-
ment for Timothy Dwight Master 
Robert Thompson's class, From West 
Africa to the Black Americas: tht Black Atlantic 
Visual Tradition, solely because of its 
religious content. 
"My interest in the store," Thompson 
said, "is that it reflects the religious icons 
of the Yoruba of Nigeria." Botanicas 
Chango #5 demonstrates the blending of 
Yoruban 
images 
with 
Roman 
Catholicism, and Thompson, 
who 
discovered the store while walking down 
Orange Street, "was very interested to 
see this Nro-American process taking 
place literally a few blocks from Yale." 
"I was very interested 
to see this Afro-
American process 
taking place literally a 
few blocks from Yale." 
,, 
Botanicas Chango #5 is greatly in-
fluenced by Spanish culture. The locked 
cabinets which surround the rectangular 
room are neatly filled with silver charms, 
jewelry, books on dreams, hair-care 
items and games. Cassettes and record 
albums, along with wedding invitations, 
Hallmark cards· and 
weU-thumbed 
novelettes, are all in Spani~h. juan juan, 
the owner from Mallorca, Spain, took the 
shop over from his cousin two years ago. 
Juan owes much of his patronage to 
Anne Kordorsky, a religious woman who 
is at the store every weekday around four 
p.m. Kordorsky belongs to a New York 
religious group that combines West 
African religions with Catholicism. She 
has a regular group of "clients" who visit · 
her at the store or at her home for advice 
and for the special bath oils or incense, 
among other materials she prescribes. "A 
lot of times they go to the doctor and he 
can't fmd anything," she said with a 
heavy Puerto Rican accent, "so they 
come and I give them something." She 
stresses, though, that a person's religion 
does not matter to her. "Everyone, they 
come privately." 
The uniqueness of Botanicas Chango 
15 prompted Melissa Park, MC '88, a 
member of Thompson's class, to visit it. 
"When you walk in cold," Park said, "you 
probably just see plastic ligures, vials and 
beads ... But there's so much more, 
there's history and culture that goes back 
centuries. It's exciting because• you're 
touching something that links past to 
present through various cultures and 
religions."

**Title: American Pop in Print**
**Author: Joe Levy**
**Page number(s): 7**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Joe Levy 
American Pop in Print 
The story of Nadine is one of obsession. 
In the Chuck Berry song, the obsession 
is with a woman the narrator sees while 
riding a bus. But Julian Dibbell, DC 
'86, and Joe Levy, BK '86, share a dif-
ferent obsession- with music as a 
whole, and, specifically, with Nadine, 
their 
newly-created 
Yale 
music 
• 
magazme. 

Despite the interest in music here, 
particularly in popular music, Dibbell 
and Levy feel students can seldmn ex-
press their interest or learn more about 
music. "It struck us that there just aren't 
enough outlets for writing about music 
at Yale," Dibbell said. "So last -semester, 
at a Chopin concert in an opera house 
in Ouro-Preto, Brazil, I decided to start 
the publication." 

Levy and Dibbell define popular 
music as "music made with recording 
and selling in mind- music geared to 
the mass market, which unfortunately 
excludes almost all jazz and classical 
music." Nadine focuses on popular 
music, yet Dibbell and Levy also want 
to write about other musical styles in-
cluding jazz. 

According to Levy, their publication 
has a much more serious approach to 
popular music than generally found at 
Yale. It will include articles about 
records and bands and analyses of dif-
ferent aspects of music. Although it is a 
serious publication, Dibbell admits, "I 
get scared about being so pretentious as 
to say it must be intelligent. I also want 
it to be humorous." 

In fact, 
after considering several 
names for their publication, Dibbell 
and Levy chose the title of a 1964 
Chuck Berry song. "It's got elegance 
and Americana," Dibbell explained, 
"although the song is politically incor-
rect, because there's so much sexism." 
"Rock and roll itself is politically incor-
rect," Levy said. The political aspect of 
nwsic could develop into an article, and 
Dibbell and Levy may broaden the 
magazine's scope to include not just 
popular music but popular culture as 
well. 

The Davenport College Coucil has 
allotted Dibbell and Levy $250 to $300 
for the first issue, due out April 26. 
They are now searching for advertisers, 
because they still need $300 to 
500. 

Dibbell and Levy expect to continue 
Nadine during the 1985-86 school year 
publishing three times a semester. Said 
Levy, "It's going to have a lot of rough 
edges, but it's also going to have a lot of 
heart and soul."

**Title: Once Upon a Time...**
**Author: Alison Cardy**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

Once upon a time Yale professors 
were children living in far off lands all 
over the world. Then they grew up and 
journeyed to the heart of New Haven to 
live (perhaps ever after, perhaps even 
happily) in an Ivory Tower. They came 
with books, Ph.Ds and gray blazers and 
soon fell into the way of life there: 
teaching, 
re earching, avoiding red 
tape. In no time their mind were filled 
with worrie and wishes, but many of 
them still carried in the misty chambers 
of distant memory one of their earliest 
educational experience : fairy tales. 

A a child I read fairy tales all the 
time." 
aid Harriet Chessman, who 
teaches "Women's Perspectives on 
Literature" and a eminar on Gertrude 
tein and Virginia Woolf. "I remember 
especially Cinderella was very impor-
tant to me, and all those fairv tales 
about a younge t daughter who had to 
uffer and then would gain through her 
uffering a prince. I under toad 
strongly, even when I was really little, the 
romantic element in a lot of the e 
torie ."' he shook her brovvn curly locks. 
And I was a pure ucker for all of it." 

Toda 
Che sman believe 
she has 
found the secret key to the magic of 
fairy tale . "Fairy tale are like puzzles. 
A child keep going back to them to 
figure out the trangene . The conflict 
i re olved at the end but you're left with 
an odd feeling. You keep di gui ing the 
conflict from your elf a a child. and 
certainly the torie keep di guising it 
from vou."' Che sman tilted her head to 
the jde. '"Maybe that' 
why rm a 
literary critic. I never thought of that." 

Knowing well the power of fairy 
tale , Che man read 
her dau hter 
torie in \·vhich women pia · more ac-
tive role . I change the tori 
I read to 
her. I don't have Papa Bear always 
speaking first or yelling or being the 
strongest, and his bowl isn't always the 
biggest," she said referring to Goldilocks. 

But even as a child, Chessman had 
the urge to deconstruct one tale that 
scared her. "Bluebeard went over the 
bounds of disguise to real violence," she 
said, recalling when Bluebeard's wife 
unlocked the one room he forbade her 
to enter. "She goes in there and sees 
blood everywhere from all his other 
wives, and also- though I might be 
making this up- the corpses of all his 
dead wives. And in the heart of the 
room is this pool of water, or maybe a 
crystal ball, and she looks into it and 
sees him 
looking back 
at her." 

Chessman paused and then whispered, 
"That's how he knows to come and kill 
her." 

"I liked Bluebeard because the wife 
escapes in the end," said Rory Browne, 
dean of Branford College, who read a 
different ver ion of the story while 
growing up in England. "You've got all 
these grisly corpses hanging in the 
wardrobe, but her brothers come and 
kill Blue beard." Browne was sent to 
English Catholic boarding school at the 
tender age of seven. "We heard an 
awful lot of stories about saints and 
martyrs," he said paling a bit. "Martyr-
dom was held out a a role model to u 
all." In school Browne pined away for his 
home in London next to the Regent' 
Park Zoo where he spent "night lying 
in bed listening to ea lions croaking." 

He remembered liking Saint Francis of 
A i i, 
because he talked with the 
animals. 

Bro\\.ne, who now teaches a graduate 
history seminar "Power and Privilege " 
remembered a "dreadful tory"' his aunt 
forced him to hear a a child. " he was a 
dentist and worried about mv habit of 
ucking my thumb " he aid, clutching 
both thumb with hi forefinger ... She 
took particular intere t in reading me 
the ·tory of The Long-Legged Tailor from 
thi German book '-vith gha tl , illu tra-
tions. There was a little boy who sucked 
his thumbs all the time, and then sud-
denly his parents warned him that if he 
didn't stop, the Long-Legged Tailor 
would get him. One day his parents go 
out, the door of the room swings open 
and this terrible figure," Browne drew a 
monstrous form in the air, "like some 
lalloping kangaroo, strode into the 
room, took out these enormous iron 
shears," he 1 reached into his blazer 
pocket, "a11d cut off the boy's thumbs. 
las~ illustration shows the boy 
holding up his hands with two bleeding 
stumps d_ripping blood down onto the 
floor into some sort of sticky red pool." 

Browne caught his breath. "I hated that 
story." 

Far away from Browne's wicked 
aunt, in southwest Mexico, lived Hec-
tor Calderon, now a profe sor of 
Chicano literature. Calderon also suf-
fered a fairy tale torture similar to 
Browne's. As a boy, Calderon could not 
fall asleep until his grandmother told 
him a story. He remembered vaguely 
stories about little horses and little peo-
ple living in little worlds, but one story 
he could not banish from his memory 
was La Llorona, or The Wailing Woman. 

"My grandmother told us the story of 
La Llorona, a woman who kills her 
children and has to go throughout the 
world wailing. My grandmother and 
others 
wore 
they 
had 
heard La 
Llorona. We knew thi woman was out 
there somewhere behind the garage, in 
the dark night, in the alley." Suddenly 
the child disappeared and the academic 
returned. "The function of this, as I ee 
it now, was to keep the kids in line. If 
you were doing something your parent 
didn't want you to do, they would evoke 
La Llorona." 

Kai Erikson, editor of The Yale Review 
and ociology profe or, confe sed he 
could not find the trail of breadcrumb 
to hi memory of childhood torie . He 
remembered likin 
Pinocchio but 
couldn't remember the character or 
plot. "A lot of the e torie are just plain 


Rory Browne, 

si~ly and no one remembers them later. 
They could have been songs or games 
or even nonsense syllables," he said, 
vehemently brushing aside an im-
aginary pile of stories. Then, clasping 
his hands back together, the sociology 
professor explained, "The most impor-
tant part · was the ritual of sitting 
together in a family group- it's a kind 
of embrace- reading the story, hearing 
the sound of the voice and the affection 
expressed by it." 

"The only things I remember are the 
scary things," said Faye Crosby, pro-
fessor of psychology, who gave her 
Oedipal analysis of one of her favorite 
childhood stories, Babar. "At one point 
in the story Babar's mother gets shot. I 
think children love that part even 
though they also hate it. I also loved the 
movie Bambi, where Bambi's mother is 
also shot and killed," said Crosby, who 
teaches psychology courses on justice 
theory and women. "Kids are both 
repelled and fascinated with the idea of 
losing their mothers. That makes them 
very vulnerable and very liberated at 
the same time. Didn't you ever feel that 
way?" 

Arthur Galston, plant biology pro-
fessor, spoke about his favorite part of 
Rapunzel. "I remember her hair being let 
down and the prince climbing up the 
tower," he said, sitting near the window 
of his ninth floor office in Kline Biology 
Tower. "And I remember a whole host 
of stories about a dragon that has to be 
conquered by a knight who has to 
rescue a damsel in the tower." Galston, 
known for his invention of TIBA which 
was later used by the Department of 
Defense to create Agent Orange, said 
Little Red Riding Hood scared him as a 
child. "I remember a drawing of a wolf 
in grandma's bed with a night cap on, 
sharp teeth, slathering a bit at the 
mouth. It made me suspicious of people 
who should be benign but have another 
side to them." 

Lars Engle, who teaches English 114, 
English 125, a Shakespeare seminar 
and Daily Themes, found the path to 
academic princehood as a young lad. 
"My mother read me The Iliad when I 
was six. She said I kept track of the 
minor characters better than she did," 
he said, grinning to himself. Engle, 
nevertheless, did not lose compassion 
for those less precocious than he. "I liked 
stories where the last shall come first. 
For example, the third simple brother 
who is thumped upon by his brothers 
goes out into the world and wonderful 
things happen to him usually because of 
his kindness to animals, not his aggres-
sion." 

Six years after The Iliad, Engle read 
The Lord of the Rings. "I was terribly, 
passion~tely involved with that world 
which was so entirely . self-containing 
and a relief from the moral dilemmas of 
adolescence." He spoke more quickly, 
"It clearly idealized asexual fantasy, and 
in some ways is imperialist and quasi-
racist." He returned to his earlier 
nostalgic tone, "But it's still gripping. 
It's so academic. Anyone who wants 
any power has to know at least three or 
four languages. And various forms of_ 
self-denial are integrally related with 
power." 

Next time you're sitting among hun-
dreds of other bobbing heads in lecture 
or around the close confines of a 
seminar table take a careful look at your 
professor. For once upon a time Yale 
professors read stories with mono-
syllabic words, simple plots and happy 
endings. They might not think much of 
them today, but those stories opened up 
worlds of fantasy, introduced them to 
the quirks of adult life and possibly had 
a 
greater impact than they might 
realize. Today some of the enchantment 
still remains in these grown up children. 
In the words of Robert Thompson, 
master of Timothy Dwight, "Anything 
that enriches our fantasy life is wonder-
ful. Our fantasy life is one of our 
dearest preserves. It gives children 
something to dream for and dream 
through."

**Title: High School Stories**

"It seems poverty and 
learning are going 
hand in hand, and 
New H aven is a poor 
city." 
At the foot of East Rock, near the Vic-
torian houses and yellow buses, parents 
drop their children off at a school where 
one student in seven has a child. At 
Wilbur Cross, one of New Haven's 
three high schools, half of the ninth 
grade reads at or below the sixth grade 
level, some at the third or fourth grade. 
Seventeen-year-olds recently released 
from prison share instructors with pro-
fessors' children headed for top colleges. 
Teachers struggle to be heard, then 
listened to. And behind the scenes, ad-
ministrators try to find a balance be-
tween strictness and fairness. 

Cross's present problems are symp-
tomatic of those facing inner city 
schools throughout the country. They 
demand solutions, or will handicap 
students in their search for employment 
and financial independence. Yet Cross 
is a better, safer school than it was 15 
years ago, when 
racial 
tensions 
threatened to disrupt classes, or in 
1978, when a teacher was murdered in 
the school store. The ethnic diversity 
which once split the school, with its 65 
percent black, 16 percent white and 19 
percent Latino population, is now one 
of its greatest strengths. Through the ef-
forts of dedicated people, not complex 
methods, not money, the school aims 
for order, then growth. 

Of Cross's 1613 students, 200 are 
enrolled 
in 
English as a 
Second 
Language (ESL) courses, which they 
can take for only three years before 
joining regular classes. Next to a script 
alphabet, a poster on the wall of Maria 
Pennachio's ESL first period class read, 
"Live up to your potential." She raised 
her voice over the Spanish words of her 
five students. "Be on time to lectures," 
she said. "You have to be overly pushy 
with you guys. Take out your note-
books and worksheets, together with a 
pen and pencil, which should be on 
your desk at this moment. Now we will 
cover the present continuous tense. How 
do we form that? Ay ay ay, come on 
everyone." The chatter quieted down a 
bit. "First you get the infinitive." She 
worked on the assigned exercises, then 
continued the lesson with a discussion of 
table manners in various Spanish-
speaking countries. 

"Louis," she said, "why are you not 
participating?" 

"Cause I had a fight last night. I don't 
feel right." 

Marie Fadus teaches an advanced class, 
called "the Yale kids" or "the back-pack 
generation." One of her students sat in 
the back of the room reading Time 
magazine, putting it down to take a 
spelling test- words from Moby Dick 
like magniloquent, argosy, unctuous and turbid. A student asked how ambergris was 
discovered, and Fadus suggested he 
look it up in an encyclopaedia and 
report to the class later. 

"I'm reading this aloud, because it's 
so exciting," she said, holding a copy of 
Melville in one hand, shaking her other 
fist for emphasis and pausing to point 
out examples of onomatopoeia. She 
discussed Plato, Kant and Locke, and 
their relation to Transcendentalism. 
She talked about victimization and 
foreshadowing. Five of the 28 students 
were professors' children, Fadus ex-
plained, and the rest were from the 
nearby area. 

In her next class Fadus teaches four 
parents. Sixteen students filed in, smell-
ing of cigarettes, pushing the desks to 
the back of the room, giving random 
hugs and high-fives. "Who's the darling 
who's got my marking book?" Fadus 
asked. After ten minutes of searching 
for the book and taking attendance, she 
told the class to write an imaginary let-
ter to Ann Landers. She explained Ann 
Landers and her job to several of the 
students, then collected their letters and 
read them aloud, encouraging the class 
to answer them. 

"Dear Ann Landers," she read. "Why 
do rich people have a lot of cars, and


poor people don't have cars and have to 
walk?" 

"Dear Ann Landers, I am 14 years 
old and I have a 23-year-old boyfriend. 
He doesn't like making love and I do. I 
sometimes feel there's someone else in 
his life that he loves, but he says he 
loves me. What do I do?" The class 
laughed relentlessly, guessing who had 
written it. 

"Dear Ann 
Landers, I have a 
boyfriend who's fooling around, but I 
have a baby by him. I want to tell his 
new girlfriend. What should I do?" 

"Send her a diaper," suggested a boy in 
the back row. 

Fadus looked a bit drained by the 
beginning of third period. "It's physically 
exhausting to be in this building," she 
said. "Some children are unwilling to 
learn, and there's almost nothing you 
can do about that. It seems poverty and 
learning are going hand in hand, and 
New Haven is a poor city. But the stu-
dent body has improved in ten years 
-there's a willingness to follow the 
rules. The greatest pleasure in teaching 
is to watch the mind grope and grow 
and be unbiased. And the greatest ad-
vantage Cross offers these youngsters is 
to be mixed up all together." 

"You can make it!!" "Please do not 
Socialize in the Classroom!" "Learn to 
LISTEN!" "Show Respect!" In the very 
quiet classroom,

lowered his voice so his seniors could
concentrate on reading their second
novel, a sixth-grade level book about
reverse discrimination.

"I don't teach it like a remedial level
class," he said. "They've done what many
people thought they couldn't do. I take
the gossipy approach with a book-
'Hey, what happened to Sam Saturday
night?' They're curious, they like peo-
ple. I love the age group because they
want attention, and a lot of times in the
homes they don't get it." Lucibello, who
described his work as a
ministry,
-pointed to success stories in his grade
book-D+'s going to B's, Fs going to
C + 's. Next to the book were adver-
tisements from the book club he en-
C<;>uraged his class to join. He spoke of
hts plans to teach them creative writing.
-.:here are students with good ideas," he
satd, "just sometimes I think they've
never been asked to put them on paper.
A lot of times they've given up, and I
don't see why they should."

Teachers in other departments also
have to cope with students working op
lower grade levels. Forty percent of the
students work on remedial math skills,
and some ninth and tenth graders use a
firth grade science book. According to
hiStory teacher Andrew Bram in an in-
terview with the NeUf Haven Register,
"Years ago there were levels in these
subjects, but education has passed
through a phase when nobody wanted
anyone to feel they were labeled. It's
self-defeating.
How do
you
meet
everybody's needs? Sometimes what
happens is, you just try to reach as
many kids as you can."

Dr. Gerald Cuddy teaches an ac-
counting class fifth period. Like many
of the teachers at Cross, he has been
teaching here for almost 20 years. "You
can come in with your standards up
here and the kids down here," he said,
indicating a gap of about three feet, "but
~hat doesn't prove anything. You have
to adjust your standards. I like working
with inner city youngsters because it's
much more rewarding. To motivate
them, success is a key. I know teachers
who brag about failing 22 out of 24
students. There are some people who
say you should keep them back, and
then they drop out at 16, and they can't
even get a job in the post office or police
department without a
high school
degree." H e was interrupted by a girl
who wanted to go to the bathroom, but
he didn't give her a pass. Bathrooms are
locked during first, third and fifth
periods, and students can be severely
reprimanded for walking in the halls
without a pass.

"Seventy percent of the public school
students in New Haven are on public
assistance," he said. "They have the
problem of not having guidance at
home. They don't have anyone at home
telling them to go to school or to get
their pencils."

As Cuddy spoke in the back of the
room, several of his students argued
near his desk. One girl raised her voice,
saying, "If you want to have a baby,

Melissa Turner 
Taped to the door on the second floor 
landing of Dwight Hall is an orange piece 
of construction paper with the hand-
printed words, "New Haven CISPES: 
Committee in Solidarity with the People 
of El Salvador." Inside, old chairs and 
couches are arranged in a circle. 
Although empty, the room still speaks to 
the visitor. Arrayed on every wall are 
posters and bumper stickers. Some pro-
test 
U.S. involvement in Central 
America: "El Salvador, the People will 
Win," "Stop the Bombing in El Salvador" 
and "U.S. out of Central America." 
Others are reminders of past events: 
"Coffee with Milk," "Dance Party" and 
"Holly Near and 
Ronnie Gilbert." 
Underneath large maps of El Salvador 
Nicaragua are photographs of 
Nicaraguan children. 
Born in 
1981 
as an informal 
undergraduate study group, CISPES is 
one of many New Haven organizations 
critical of U.S. involvement in Latin 
America. Registered with Dwiglu Hall, 
CISPES has 35 members, including city 
residents, alumni, faculty, graduate 
students and undergraduates. Originally 
concerned with the struggle in 
E1 
Salvador, the group has focused most 
recently on Nicaragua as well. CISPES 
calls for popular rule in Central America, 
it 
implements this 
belief in 
democracy within itself: CISPES has no 
president, no heirarchy. With letters to 
Congressmen and rallies, the group con-
stantly asks the U.S. government to re-
examine its role in the region. Moreover, 
CISPES works within El Salvador and 
Nicaragua, funding both medical relief 
and community projects, attempting to 
restore order in war-torn areas. 
"We share a common belief that U.S. 
intervention is not useful for the U.S. or 
for the region," said Alicia Fernandes, 
'83, a founder of the study group."We 
definitely believe mass struggles should 
be supported." From its earliest stages, 
CISPES has been a political supporter of 
the Salvadoran FDR-FMLN, an alliance 
of the political party, the Democratic 
Revolutionary Front (FDR) and the 
guerilla faction, Frente Farabundo Marti 
de Liberacion (FMLN). Viewing FDR-
FMLN as the legitimate voice of the 
Salvadoran people, CISPES shows its 
support for the coalition by trying to 
educate the Yale and New Haven com-
munities. The group shows films and 
presents speakers, revealing FDR-
FMLN's struggles against the repressive 
Salvadoran government and military. 
Although CISPES does not support 
the alliance fmancially, it does raise 
money for a medical relief fund in FDR-
FMLN-held regions of El Salvador. 
CISPES contends it can only provide aid 
to civilians through such a fund, because 
relief sent to government-controlled areas 
would probably never reach the injured. 
More likely, the funds would be con-
fiscated by the government, or the doc-
tors who received them would be ar-
rested for engaging in subversive activity. 
Most recently, funds raised have been 
channeled into the Salvadoran Medical 
Relief Fund run by a U.S. medic, Dr. 
Charles Clements. He went to El 
Salvador after seeing the effects of the 
bombs he had dropped as a pilot in Viet-
nam. Wishing to treat the most severely 
injured, Clements chose to work in FDR-
FMLN areas, prime bombing targets for 
the Salvadoran Army. "The Salvadoran 
army is using a 'scorch earth policy.' It is 
destroying villages that it thinks support 
guerillas," said English Professor Richard 
Halpern, who was the frrst graduate stu-
dent to join CISPES. "The war effort is 
not against the guerillas because the 
army can't pin them down. The only war 
that they can wage is against the civilian 
infrastructure. And the civilian casualties 
have been high. It's been documented

that both napalm and white phosphorous 
bombs are being used by the Salvadoran 
army." To date, CISPES has contributed 
to the Fund over $13,000 from the HoUy 
Near/ Ronnie Gilbert concert last year 
and over S800 from the Sabia concert this 
March. 
Through the Fund, membt'rs feel they 
repair, if only in some small way, the 
damage inflicted by U.S. backed forces. 
"If the U.S. gives aid that hurts the peo-
ple," Donna Minkowitz, CC '85, said, 
"we want to counteract it and give aid 
that helps them. So, if the U.S. provides 
the bombs, we want tO provide medical 
aid."

While CISPES provides relief through 
a third party in El Salvador, it has 
become much more directly involved in 
Nicaragua. CISPES recognizes the San-
dinista government, although the U.S. 
supports rebel groups, known as contras, 
who wish to overthrow it. In Nicaragua 
the organization performs solidarity 
work: building community facilities and 
funding agricultural projects. 
In a small Nicaraguan town called San 
Ignacio, hidden in the hills on the Pacific 
coast, a small winding dirt road leads past 
the three or four ramshackle homes that 
comprise the center of town, past the 
small school and health post built by the 
Sandinistas, to another dirt path. The 
trail leads to a building in an open field 
with cows grazing nearby, the rural 
work-study school built by the San-
dinistas. Here, 135 grade schoolers learn 
to cultivate crops and to dairy farm. 
When CISPES member John Adler, '84, 
visited San Ignacio two summers ago, the 
Sandinistas had completed the construc-
tion of the school but had no funds to buy 
cows. Consequently, the schoolchildren 
had no milk to drink. Through several 
fundraising events, coffeehouses and 
dances, CISPES raised $1000, enough 
money to buy five cows for the school. 
CISPES is currently involved in a pro-

ject in Ocotal, one of the largest north-
ernmost Nicaraguan cities, located ten 
kilometers from the Honduran border. 
The city has a long history of struggle 
against U.S.-backed forces, dating back 
to 1927 when Agusto Sandino's army at-
tacked U.S. Marines stationed there. 
Because the region has remained a San-
dinista stronghold, it is oft!!n assaulted by 
the contras. Last year, Ocotal was attacked 
three times, the most recent of these 
raids destroying the regional grainary, 
sawmill, coffee mill and radio station. 
Working in a mental health clinic out· 
side !'vtanagua, CISPES member David 
Geltman, CC '85, visited Ocotal las{ 
summer. "I met with someone on a bus 
who invited me to the city. On my re-
turn, I spent a week in the house of a 
woman coordinator of a Sandinista 
Defense Committee (a mass organization 
with chapters in every neighborhood)," 
Gettman said. During the course of his 
conversations with

Gehman heard about the redevelopment 
project in which CISPES is now involved. 
The Sandinista Committee wanted to 
build a community center on the out-
skirts of town which would lodge a 
nursery, meeting hall and health clinic. 
Although the community could supply 
the labor, the building supplies and the 
space, 
it lacked 
funds because the 
government itself did not initiate the pro-
ject. "When I told the coordinator how 
we (CISPES) might raise the money they 
needed by giving parties, she told me a 
very telling thing. She said that they used 
to hold fundraising parties, but now they 
can't because they are in constant fear of 
attack from the contras. They have to be 
on alert at all times," Gettman said. So 
far, CISP ES has raised $700 of the SlOOO 
~~ pledged and hopes to complete the pro-
Ject by early summer. 

Along 
with such solidarity work, 
CISPES also engages in anti-intervention 
activities, attempting to influence the 
government's Central America policy 
d~ions. The group has organized bus 
tnps to rallies in Washington to protest 
U.S. involvement in Nicaragua. The last 
March on Washington on November 12, 
1983 saw a New Haven contingent that 
filled six buses. "It was a huge organizing 
effort and it was very successful," Fer-
nandes said. "To have 300 people commit 
$27 and one day and a night is a big state-
ment." 

Last month, C ISPES completed its 
Contra Contra Campaign. The group col-
lected signatures and held letter-writing 
campaigns to C onnecticut Congressmen, 
urging them to vote against the release of 
$14 million in suspended C IA funds for 
the contras. "Whether you believe the con-
tras commit atrocmes, whether you 
disagree 
with 
U.S. intervention or 
whether you support the Nicaraguan 
government, it doesn't really matter. You 
can still support our position against 
funding them (the contras)," said Eric 
Arnesen, a ftfth year graduate student of 
Afro-American and labor history. "We 
want the Congressmen to know that they 
aren't going out on a limb when they vote 
against the aid. We want to give them the 
confidence to vote and to let them know 
they have support in their constituency." 

Arnesen joined C ISP ES two years ago 
during the he ightening of U.S. involve-
ment in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Since 
then, he has devoted a great deal of time 
working for the group- his C ISPES 
responsibilities share priority with his 
dissertation and his teaching. Arnesen's 
commitment to C ISPES and its prin-
ciples permeates his speech, his emphatic 
gestures and his clothing. The words 
"Solidaridad con El Salvador" and the im-
age of two Indian women, one with a 
raised clenched fist, is visible on the pur-
ple t-shirt he wears. 

Arnesen and other members apply 
their political p rinciples not only to their 
work in Central America, but to the 
organization itself. As part of its commit-
ment to democracy, CISP ES actively 
supports fem inism. 
Women always 
represent the group at public events. 
Said 
Fernandes, "Women 
represen-
tatives are good for C ISP ES internally. 
Women who come to the events see that 
not all politicos are male. We show that 
women are assertive and politically active

about issues other than 'women's issues.'" 

Often fundraisers attempt to inform 
the audience about both Central America 
and feminism. The Holly Near/Ronnie 
Gilbert concert proved successful because 
of the large feminist turnout from the 
surrounding area, since both singers are 
well-known feminists. The Sabia concert 
featured a group which sang leftist and 
feminist songs in Spanish. "It was really 
exciting speaking to a feminist audience 
about C ISPES' projects at the Holly 
Near concert," 
Minkowitz said. 
"Feminists around here are the ones who 
happen to be the most activist because 
they have been organized for a long time 
already. It's good to talk to a group about 
Central America that is already politi-
cized." 

As part of their belief in equality, 
CISPES has 
neither 
officers 
nor 
bureaucracy. "In terms of ranks, there 
aren't any distinctions made. Students 
are considered adults. If there is a heirar-
chy at all-and I don't think there IS-it's 
with vears of membership to CISPES," 
said Renaissance Studies DUS Susanne 
Wofford. Formerly a member of the 
Yale Faculty Committee on Central 
America, 
Wofford joined CISPES 
because she wanted to "''ork with a more 
diverse and active group of people. 

Because there is no presic!c:nt, members 
volunteer to chair the weekly Monday 
evening meetings, while others take notes 
or time discussions. The "rotating chair" 
guarantees continuity through gradua-
tions and the constant addition of ne"' 
members. Newcomers can observe the 
more experienced members as they run 
meetings before they volunteer to chair 
one themselves. 

Although devoted to action, CISPES 
strongly 
believes 
in 
self-education 
through observation, reading and discus· 
sion. "We operate on the assumption that 
what has brought a person to us is a con-
cern, not a lot of previous knowledge," 
Wofford said. To learn more about cur-
rent political and social events in Latin 
CISPES 
members 
meet 
regularly as a study group. The member 
who volunteers to lead the self-education 
session assigns articles for reading and 
discussion. In these sessions, members 
examine everything from the situation of 
women in Nicaragua to the policies of the 
FDR-FMLN, from land reform to 
homosexual rights. 

The Monday evening meetings pro-
cede from a ney.-s summary and lll'lalysis 
of Latin American concerns to reports 
from each of the four committees and 
concludes with a period of "critlself-crit." 
Conducted without time constraints, this 
period allows members to discuss what 
went well during the meeting, what went 
poorly,

themselves, whether anyone made 
statements that were chauvinistic on 
either a national or personal level. "Many 
of us feel that we're in this conflict for the 
long haul," Arnesen said, referring to 
their conflict with U.S. government 
policies. "So we have to be able to work 
together and to talk to each other honest-
ly." 

People sit on the chairs and couches, on 
the table tops and floor, listening to an ru:• 
count of the week's news in Nicaragua. A 
friendly dog who answers to the name 
Sandinista makes his rounds to be pet-
ted. Professor Halpern looks at the watch 
in his hands and reminds Geltman that 
there are five minutes left. Geltman sug-
gellts that the group move on to news 
from FJ Salvador. "A Congressional 
caucus accused the administration of sup-
plying 'insufficient, misleading and, in 
some cases, false information' on FJ -
Salvador. The caucus stated that twice 
the supposedly 55 U.S. officials are pre-
sent in FJ Salvador and that U.S. person-

"The stereotype of Yale in the 1950s as a 
bunch of prep school kids whose fathers 
went to Yale had a lot of truth to it," 
remembered Worth David, dean of 
undergraduate admissions. "There were 
a lot of guys here who were looking to 
coast through college playing sports and 
having a good time before landing a job 
with a New York brokerage firm." 

Change came in the 1960s. With the 
support 
of then-President 
Kingman 
Brewster, Dean of Admissions Insley 
Clark trimmed the percentage of private 
school students, opened Yale to women, 
accepted more minority applicants and 
rejuvenated emphasis on academic ability. According to Clark, the rationale for 
these changes was quite simple. "The student body was not diversified enough nor 
intellectually strong enough to make Yale 
the national and international resource it 
ought to be." 

Today's Admissions Office tries to 
follow Clark's guidelines. "The admissions 
process consists of taking the kids 
with the strongest academic records," 
David said, "then consciously trying to 
put a diverse class together. We don't 
want a class with 1300 history majors." 

But 'diversity' is a nebulous and provocative 
term 
that 
must somehow 
translate into specific policies. Now, it 
often boils down to the special consideration given to three groups who comprise 
only one-third of the total applicant pool: 
legacies, 
under-represented minority 
groups and athletes. 

Of course, extraordinary musical and 
artistic ability are part of the admissions 
equation, and David considers geographical 
diversity a particularly important 
asset 
as 
well. 
"There are some 
geographical differences which TV and 
other factors haven't wiped out. New 
England and Southern kids still look at 
things quite differently." 

Roughly the first 1000 strongest applicants breeze through the admissions 
process with "little or no discussion. 
24 The New Journal/April 19, 1985 
There's an academic minimum that a 
student be able to do Yale work, and in 
most cases a minimum standard of social 
or extra-curricular ability," David explained. "Academic promise alone is not 
in most cases enough to get a student into 
Yale. We want to be able to find the kid a 
roommate." 

But once these students are admitted, 
there are still thousands more applications for the Admissions Committee to 
consider and 
about 
another 
1000 
students to be accepted. At this stage of 
the process, it begins to matter whether a 
student's father or mother went to Yale, 
whether an applicant is a member of a 
minority group and whether an applicant 
shows the ability and the desire to play a 
varsity sport. 

Legacies are the group most privileged 
by the Admissions Office, with a stable 
acceptance rate of about 40 percent. 
"Around the Ivies the standard admit 
rate for legacies is twice the rate of other 
applicants," David noted. "Of the groups 
which 
receive 
special consideration, 
legacies have the strongest conventional 
qualifications, probably because of income, family values and the like." 

Although David termed legacies "about 
as qualified" as their classmates here, he 
did admit that they sometimes are not on 
par with other Yalies. 

Despite this fact, legacies are accepted 
to Yale at such a high rate because 
they- or more accurately their parents-
are essential to the University's financial 
welfare. Director of Development Terry 
Holcombe, '64, spends much of his time 
"keeping alumni 
happy." 
Holcombe 
pointed out, "Since the late 1960s Yale 
has had to depend heavily on gifts to sustain itself. Inky Clark's changes bred a 
whole generation of disappointed 
parents." 

While most of the alumni are used to 
seeing roughly a fifth of each class reserved for the sons and daughters of 
Yale, Holcombe still gets phone calls

about 'individual disappointments.' "It's 
tough to respond to the parents. If I say, 
'Look, we bent over backwards and your 
kid still didn't get in,' it only makes them 
feel worse," he said. "My most difficult 
cases are the ones who got into Harvard 
and not into Yale. And then there's the 
guy who gets really mad and writes us a 
few years later to inform us of his son's 
election to Phi Beta Kappa. There's just 
not that much I can do." 

Every year, Holcombe informs the 
Admissions Committee about parents' 
involvement in development projects, in 
terms of donations and alumni work. He 
realizes, 
however 
success 
is 
never 
assured. "Each year we wait anxiously for 
the print-out to come over from Admis-
sions. There have been some things that 
have delighted us and there have been 
some major disappointments." 

Although in a sense every legacy 
applicant is Holcombe's concern, he 
targets the most important cases. David 
explained, "Like Carm Cozza, Terry tells 
me what he wants-and the people at the 
top of his list are important to us." 

Like minorities and legacies, athletes' 
applications also receive an additional 
reading in the admissions process. The 
big spectator sports, particularly football, 
receive top priority in athletics admis-
sions. "Each year our coaches are in con-
tact with and receive applications from 
between 1500 and 2000 students in-
terested in playing varsity sports," Direc-
tor of Athletics Frank Ryan estimated. 

Football players who fall into this 
category receive 'top,' 'middle' or 'bottom' 
ratings according to their ability and their 
interest in Yale. Describing candidates in 
the top category, David said, "If we think 
they are representative of the rest of their 
class academically, then they will prob-
ably be admitted. A comparable can-
didate who does not play sports has only 
a one in four chance. Football players are 
not necessarily stellar students, and it's 
probably fair to say that they don't crowd 
the ranks of Phi Beta Kappa. But if 
they get caught up only in sports, we've 
wasted a spot. I know we make some

mistakes, because other people tell us 
about them. Those people don't realize 
that we're generally taking kids from 
blue-collar backgrounds for whom the 
benefit of a Yale education is great." 

Each year the football coaches give the 
Admissions Office's 
two athletic 
coordinators the names of some 250 
players. About 95 of these candidates will 
be accepted, which works out to an ad-
mission rate of between 30 and 40 per· 
cent, greater than the rate for minorities 
but less than that oflegacies. Yale counts 
on a good deal of attrition. As:;istant 
Coach Sebastian Laspina said , "We want 
to see 50 kids out for the freshman team 
and 30 from each of the upper classes." 

"Admissions defmitely looks out for 
us," said Laspina, who supervises football 
recruiting. "But like everybody else, Ad· 
missions gets caught up in the glamor 
spots. There's been a shortage oflinemen 
over the past few years, and linemen are 
crucial." Laspina explained that football 
players from prep schools have little 
chance of being accepted. "A kid from the 
deep South or far West '"'-ill have a higher 
rank and that will make Admissions look 
better. Yale is ,·ery conscious of what 
other schools think of its admissions stan· 
dards." 

Although they do not offer athletic 
scholarships. Ivy League colleges do ag· 
gressively recruit athletes, particularly 
football players. According to David ... All 
schools spend a disproportionate amount 
of time on athletic recruiting." 

Somewhat uneasy over the treatment


"Academic promise 
alone is not in most 
cases enough to get a 
student into Yale. We 
want to be able to 
find the kid a 
roommate." 

he has received from the press, Ryan 
described athletic recruiting in very low-
key terms, stressing that all the sports 
programs look for athletes who can profit 
from several different aspects of the Yale 
experience. "We don't sell the kids Yale 
athletics," Ryan said. "We sell them 
Yale." Coach Laspina agreed. "We want 
a kid who's going to feel at home and isn't 
going to stick out academically or socially. 
The attrition rate is pretty high, and we 
don't want some goon running around 
here who's wrecked his knee and decides 
he doesn't want to play any more." But 
for Laspina, football recruiting is clearly a 
business. "Coaching isn't different from 
any job in the real world. We have to pro-
duce. If we don't get good kids, we'll start 
losing consistently. The administration 
will think we're dumb, and then we'll be 
out of a job." 

Thus motivated, 
football coaches 
spend much time and money recruiting. 
Every spring they mail a letter to coaches 
at almost every high school in the coun-
try, expressing interest in players in the 
top 10 percent of their class with SAT 
SCOres over 1200- the 20th percentile of 
each Yale class. High school coaches, 
under pressure to get their players into a 
good college, will often overlook these 
academic requirements and give Yale the 
names of less qualified players. 

Under NCAA regulations, Coach 
Cozza and his staff must wait until 
December 1 to visit players at the high 
schools, where they pick up filins of each 
candidate's performance during one 
game. If a player passes his ftlm test, he 
is invited to Yale for an all-expense-paid 
weekend. He is housed with a member 
of the team and shown the campus, 
sports facilities and football highlight 
ftlms. Laspina added however, "I make 
sure they take him to the libraries, show 
him the academic stuff. I like it when a 
player gets to a Friday class." 

Mike Curtin, OC '86, favorably re-
called his recruiting experience. "I had 
signed a letter of intent to go to the 
University of Utah back in my home 
state. I never thought I'd get into Yale, 
but when I did I remember thinking, 
'Gee, I really want to go visit, just to see 
the place.' On my visit, the thing that 
made me decide to come here was Coach 
Cozza. He didn't even talk football. He 
talked about my decision in terms of the 
total experience. He said the experiences 
you'll have here will be like no place else. 
On the plane ride home, I decided to try 
to get out of my letter of intent." 

John Zanieski, SM '85, added, "When 
1 came to Yale, I saw that the football 
players commanded a lot of respect, both 
among themselves and among the stu-
dents generally. It looked like a classy 
organization." 

Ryan would not disclose the budget for 
athletic recruiting, saying that the figures 
are "difficult to ir.terpret correctly." He 
did say the budget is •comparable to that 
of other Ivy League schools." David 
noted that funding comes not only from 
the University, but also from separate 
alumni funds for the individual sports. 

Comparing athletic recruiting to other 
admissions recruiting, David said, "We 
fly on super-saver flights. You can't get 
that bringing in an athlete for the 
\O."Cekend. I wouJd imagine that th• 
athletic recruitment budget is much 
larger than ours and far larger than the 
$29,000 we devote to our student minori-
ty recruitment budget." 

Even with that relatively small amount 
of money, minority admissions and 
recruitment at Yale have come a long 
way, according to Muhammed Abdullah, 
'70, the director of minority recruitment. 
"In the 1960s when I attended Yale," Ab-
dullah said, "there were only about a 
hundred other black students on campus. 
I'd see someone on the street who looked 
like me and I'd stop because it was so 
unusual." 

During 
the same 
period, 
Black 
Students at Yale (BSA Y) persuaded 
Clark to accept an informal quota for 
black applicants. After a corresponding 
initial rise, the number of minority ap-
plicants and matriculants has fluctuated 
widely since the 1960s. Since Abdullah 
began work in 1981, numbers in both 
groups have risen substantially. But cam-
pus minority groups protest the declining 
rate of admission for minority students, 
which hit an all-time low of 24 percent 
last year. 

This phenomenon is most pronounced 
among Asians, whose applications have 
quadrupled over the past four years and 
who will reportedly face an admission 
rate below that of whites this year. Tom 
Saenz and William Oh, both ES '87 and 
co-chairmen of the minority recruitment 
program, are alarmed. "This couJd hap-
pen eventually to any minority group," 
Oh said. "Asians are competing with 
other Asians for the same slots and are 
practicaJy being penalized for having 
large numbers of qualified applicants. 
The legacy admit rate remains steady, 
while ours drops each year. The policy ig-
nores the fact that Asians still face 
discrimination." 

David defended his policy firmly. "The 
Admissions Office has examined the 
tremendous increase in Asian applicants, 
and we've found that the increase has 
been in suburban, professional Asians. 
Standards are tougher for them. It's not 
the lower-income, urban Asian who is 
gening squeezed out." But because the 
Admissions Committee meetings are 
closed, it is difficult for David to clarify 
this process. This controversy over the 
limits of affirmative action will probably 
not be settled until the Executive Com-
rnitteeonAdmissions Policy holds its next 
meeting, most likelr next year, according

Gilbert Garcia, BR '85, a Latino from El Paso, Texas, explained his role in Yale's minority recruitment program.  He described his work as more of a friend than a recruiter, aiming to help prospective students gain admission to a four-year college, even if it's not Yale.  His efforts involve contacting prospective students, college counselors, and parents to address concerns and encourage applications.  He helps students with their essays and ensures they have backup school options.  He also aims to dispel the concerns of parents about their children losing their ethnic identity.  The article also discusses the challenges and controversies surrounding Yale's admissions process, including the economic disparity among accepted minority students and the limited reach of their recruitment efforts.  The program includes 40 undergraduate volunteer recruiters who travel home to recruit other minorities over Thanksgiving.

The article discusses the complexities of Yale's financial aid system, using the "Uniform Methodology."  The author presents a hypothetical scenario of two identical families with different savings, highlighting the system's focus on current financial situation rather than past choices.  Donald Routh, Director of Yale's Financial Aid Office, explains the system's limitations and challenges, such as varying costs of living and the difficulty in assessing individual circumstances.  The article explores the inconsistencies and subjective judgments inherent in the system, even with efforts to create a uniform approach. The article details Yale's use of statistical solutions, such as tables from the National Board of Realtors, to account for fluctuations in real estate values.  Despite these adjustments, the article concludes that the system remains imperfect, requiring continuous reevaluation.

sell his second home. The student re-
called, "Their· attitude was, 'Yale is a 
hardship. Act like it's a hardship."' But 
Routh shook his head and explained, 
"The Uniform Methodology has to make 
some assumptions about what standard 
. of living is appropriate for families asking 
for ·rmancial aid. That system assumes 
one house. We don't make a personal 
judgment that they shouldn't have a se-
cond home, but we do make ajudgment 
that they shouldn't expect more fmancial 
aid because of it." 
Stephen Knight, SY '87, has an even 
more complex problem. His father, an 
Episcopal minister, recently moved from 
California to Hawaii and purchased a 
very expensive new home. Upon seeing 
the price of his home on Knight's fman· 
cial aid application, Yale revoked his 
financial aid award. The Knight family 
claims that the new home does not repre-
sent any change in income, but rather in-
sists that most of the new home was paid 
for by the church and the sale of the old 
home, while the rest required a large 
mortgage, which the family must now 
repay. Routh asked, "Did the family 
need a home of that magnitude? If the 
problem was that they were suddenly 
obliged to use all of their resources to 
support a parent in a nursing home, we 
would have been more sympathetic. 
However, since they knew that it was a 
time in their lives when they should be 
providing education for their children, 
I'm trying to understand a little better 
how they come to buy that kind of home. 
Families must make certain decisions 
about standards of living when their 
children go to Yale." Knight is threaten-
ing to withdraw from Yale and the fman-
cial aid department is continuing its in-
vestigation of the situation. 
In these cases the issues are not clear· 
cut. Yale is a hardship for many families 
who have to make sacrifices. But when 
that means not buying the house that 
they want, having to sell a retirement 
home or forcing one parent to look for a 
higher paying job, the high tuition may 
cause parents to regret sending their

children to Yale in the f~rst place. One 
junior recalled, "When I go home, it's just 
one constant hassle about how much Yale 
costs. My folks want me to accelerate a 
semester just to save the money." 
Even without parental pressure 
students often run into monetary dif-
ficulties at Yale, especially with the re-
quirement that they work both during 
the school year and over the summer. 
John Morrell, BK '86 noted, "You strug-
gle to earn $1400 during the year, and 
when you get out, that's peanuts. I'd 
rather have all that time to do more 
things while I have the opportunity to do 
them at Yale, but I'm already going to be 
$10,000 in debt." 
Other students disagreed. 
Darius

time for a solar-paneling f1rm, said,

**The Financial Aid Predicament at Yale**
**Author: Anne Applebaum**
**Page number(s): 34-35**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
President Giamatti, a Canadian citizen, was unable to get aid from the Quebecois government partly because the "separatist government wasn't particularly interested in subsidizing an English-speaking student at an American university." When he told Yale that he would not be receiving this aid, Yale recommended he "ask again politely," although Hyder knew that the political situation made the effort almost completely futile.


Due to politics, bureaucracy, and postal systems, it took almost a full year for Hyder to receive financial aid. He explained, "The delay was both completely unnecessary, and completely predictable to anyone who knew anything at all about Canadian politics."


Hyder's earlier difficulties receiving enough financial aid led in part to his decision to take two years off from Yale. He attributed his problems to the department's limited knowledge of the particular problems of foreign students, and noted, "They don't keep abreast of the Canadian dollar, and the different taxation policies, or they don't appear to. Most Canadian students at Yale are quite wealthy, because average Canadian students can't even think about coming here. Yale just doesn't offer them enough money. I'm back because my father has a new job."


But the use of averages to analyze the situations of individuals, the bureaucratic confusions and the paradoxes they create are not unique to Yale. Some form of the Uniform Methodology is used to determine need at most universities, and many policies are common among all the members of the Ivy League, a group formed expressly to insure that no students, and no athletes in particular, would choose one school over another on the basis of financial aid policies. Until recently all Ivy League schools held to an "aid-blind" admissions policy and offered to meet the full financial needs of all who were accepted. Brown and Dartmouth no longer make these claims.


Recognizing the difficulty of providing the one million dollars worth of financial aid that Yale must come up with every year, Morrel confessed, "Complaining about financial aid is like looking a gift horse in the mouth. But almost everyone has some problem with it_" Others remain mystified by what seems from the outside to be a completely arbitrary process. One student noted, "Every year they come up with some figure that we're supposed to pay, and it never seems to have any relationship to how much money we really have. So every year we have to figure out a new way to pay it."


Some students are so wary of the financial aid department's authority that they were reluctant or unwilling to discuss their difficulties.


But behind this desire not to rock the boat lie some very serious anxieties about the future of financial aid at Yale. This winter, the Reagan administration indicated that student loan programs may no longer be immune from budget cuts, leading to speculation that Yale will have to reconsider its full financial aid policy. The proposed budget cuts could seriously alter the status of any student receiving a federal loan. Denying rumors of future policy changes, Routh stated, "No suggestion has been made that this is even a remote possibility. We are concerned but are not panicking and do not plan to change our policy." The Yale Corporation itself has assured Routh that the policy of providing full financial aid is in no danger of being abolished and will continue to be a University priority. Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti recently spoke against cuts in the student loan programs before a Congressional subcommittee, and stated at last week's rally against the aid cuts that the government policy reversal "would turn back a fundamental tie that has run through American history ... the principle that access to America in the fullest and best sense of the word is through education on one's merit."


But Yale's financial aid department remains caught in a double bind. On the one hand, it will always be subject to the will of budget writers both within and outside of the University. On the other hand, its own bureaucracy and even its unavoidable demands upon students create difficulties for them and their families. Any student whose individual situation deviates from pre-established norms may find him or herself in conflict with a financial aid officer who must make decisions about the student's finances according to what may be purely subjective criteria, or at least criteria which differ from the student's own values. With 80 percent of Yale undergraduates working, borrowing and receiving gift aid from Yale, the financial aid department cannot afford to become any less concerned with the particular problems of individual students, especially if the level of government commitment to students begins to change. Otherwise, Yale's price tag will again dictate who can attend Yale and who cannot even consider applying.

W hen I first called John Ostrom to ask 
him for an interview he laughed at me. 
Then he asked, "Wiry do you want to do 
this?" I sighed and explained to him that 
his work as a professor of paleontology, 
-his 
relations with 
the 
Peabody 
Museum, and his role in establishing 
Yale's geology field camp in Wyoming 
were all interesting aspects of Yale that 
very few people knew of. He laughed 
again, paused and finally agreed to 
meet with me. 


Although Ostrom seemed reluctant 
to speak to me, I had already heard that 
he was an amiable man who enjoyed 
talking about his work. If you just sit 
d own 
with 
him 
and mention 
De inonychus, 
his 
most 
famous 
dinosaur discovery, then "he just kinda 
grins and will go ofT telling you about 
it," one of his students had said. I de-
cided it was worth a shot. 


At his office in Kline Geology Lab, 
Ostrom, a short, stolid man with a full 
head of wavy grey hair, greeted me with 
a fmn handshake- probably from pick-
ing up large bones, I thought to myself. 
He peered at me over the top of his 
glasses, and led me through his office 
door, which was plastered with draw-
ings and comics. Inside, I stopped 
momentarily to take in the room, filled 
with stacks of papers. Masses of bones 
and skeletons were scattered every-
where, as though a small zoo had ex-
ploded within. He moved some papers 
from a chair for me and I said, •Let's 
talk about Deinonychus." 


Ostrom recalled a 1964 expedition to 
Montana, when his research party dis-
covered a set of very unusual claws "just 
resting on the earth's bare surface." H is 
team excavated the site and unearthed 
what was not only the most extraor-
dinary dinosaur discovered in recent 
years, but vital evidence that some 
dinosaurs were warm-blooded. 


"We brought the remains back to the 
lab here at Yale and reconstructed the 
anatomy," Ostrom said. The animal he 
pieced together, bone by bone, was an 
intimidating beast: a 150-pound, eight-
foot long, two-legged carnivore which 
ran in packs of up to ten and was 
capable of killing animals over five 
times its own weight. "Its most unusual 
aspect, as well as the reason for its 
ferocious ability, was its foot structure. 
Each foot consisted of two toes with a 
third, huge, scythe-like claw. The 
Deinonychus used those two feet for 
walking and for killing. It destroyed its 
prey by hopping on one leg and killing 
with the other, or it used both legs for 
hunting, 
much like 
a 
kick-boxer," 
Ostrom said. 


Deinonychus' strange foot structure 
suggested to Ostrom that the creature 
might have been warm-blooded, a 
theory many of his colleagues doubted. 
•Dinosaurs of all kinds have been tradi-
tionally classified as reptiles because of 
certain anatomical, skeletal, and struc-
tural features that are typical of reptiles 
and not of warm-blooded birds or 
mammals," he explained. •Reptiles are 
cold-blooded ektotherms, meaning they 
need external sources of heat, which is 
why they bask in the sun and are inac-
tive 
until they get 
their body 
temperature up to full level. Mammals 
and birds, however, are capable of 
"It destroyed its prey 
by hopping on one leg 
and killing with the 
other, or it used both 
legs for hunting, 
much like a kick-
boxer." 


The Yale geology camp in Wyoming 
generating their own internal heat and 
can therefore be in continual motion." 


The difference in their metabolism is 
that endotherms function at "full-
throttle," maintaming that constant ac-
tion due to consumption of food . "It's 
important for the animal to run at rac-
ing speed instead of at an idle," Ostrom 
said. 


"When we found Oeinonychus and 
reconstructed its anatomy it proved to 
be a very fast and very agil<' animal, 
quite different from any dinosaur I had 
seen before," he said. All of these factors 
suggested to him that it was a high-
metabolic predator, possibly a mam-
mal. 


Also, 
he 
pointed out 
that 
Oeinonychus could only walk on two 
feet. Leaning forward in his chair, he 
asked me what animal did I kno~ that 
could ong walk on two feeL Without 
waiting for my reply, 0 trom smiled 
and 
ans~ered- hi rds 
Because 
legs it was more like a bird than a rep-
tile, and therefore mo t likely warm-
blooded. 


There are only 
five existing 
specimens of Demonychus in the world; 
Ostrom keeps Yale's very valuable re-
mains in a file cabinet in his office. He 
led me over to that cabinet and showed 
me the actual vertebrae of Oeinonychus' 
tail, used as a dynamic stabilizer for 
running at high speeds, much like the 
parasol of a tightrope walker. A con-
temporary form of the Oeinonychus, 
the roadrunner, has a very similar taif. 


Ostrom became less formal as he 
carefully removed from the cabinet one 
of the only specimens of Oeinonychus' 
wrist. He pointed out how that wrist 
enabled Oeinonychus to make powerful 
sweeps with its deadly claw and disem-
bowel its unlucky victim. Smiling, he 
took great pride in showing me the wrist 
and then allowing me to hold it. 


Shortly after his discovery, Ostrom 
heard of some colleagues who were 
planning 
to 
use 
name 
"Oeinonvchus" for a dinosaur of their 
own finding. "Most dinosaurs are nam-
ed something-'saurus' and I wanted 
something distinct. I had to have that 
name," he said. So he published a short 
paper describing his find and gave it his 
official name: dino for ~terrible," O'!)X 
for "claw:"' T~bl~ Ckzu.. However in 
1969, when he finally published his 
ground-breaking 
theorv 
on 
Deinonychus, the paleontology com-
munity ,,·as skeptical. His colleagues 
disputed Ostrom's reconstruction of the 
foot, 
key 
to his theory that 
Deinonychus was warm-blooded. 


Ostrom's confirmation came a few 
years later when a joint M ongolian-
Polish expedition in M ongolia made an 
extraordinary discovery: the completely 
intact skeletons of a Veloceraptor, a 
cousin of Deinonychus, and a large 
Protoceratops, which had died in com-
bat together. Not only was the di~osaur 
found clinging to the head of the Pro-
toceratops, but one of its massive claws 
was buried in the plant-eater's chest. 


"You don't know how hard I've tried to 
get in to see that specimen," said 
Ostrom, sitting up in his chair. "But it's 
in Ulan Bator in the People's Republic 
of Mongolia, a part of the USSR which 
is not recognized by the U.S.- no 
diplomatic relations at 
all except 
through Moscow." He has met with his 
M ongolian coun'terpart, but that scien-
tist cannot get the remains out of 
M ongolia for Ostrom to see. Never-
theless, 
rvtongolian 
disco,•ery 
verified Ostrom's theory once and for 
all 


M ore recently. Ostrom has been stu-
dying a different dinosaur called Ar-
chaeopteryx, believed to be the key to 
the evolution of birds from reptiles. 
This controversial theory was first pro-
posed in 1876 by Thomas H enry Hux-
ley, the loyal defender of Charles Dar-
win, and has undergone many twists 
and variations since then. At one point, 
a colleague of Ostrom's named Alick. 
Walker proposed that birds evolved 
from crocodiles. Ostrom responded to 


Walker immediately, having studied all 
of the five ·existing specimens of Ar-
chaeopteryx. Although Archaeopteryx 
had 
feathers 
and other bird-like 
characteristics, Ostrom showed that if 
you took away the feathers, then the 
skeleton looked exactly like a small 
dinosaur. Ostrom had shown conclusive-
ly that Archaeopteryx and birds in 
general must have evolved from small 
carnivorous reptiles. Walker, a professor 
at Newcastle-on-the-Tyne in England, 
has since rejected his own theory and ac-
cepted Ostrom's. 


Ostrom's theory on Archaeopteryx has 
become generally accepted by the paleon-
tology community, and last September 
O strom organized an international con-
ference on Archaeopteryx in order to 
come to an agreement on how flight 
evolved. He called the conference a 
"smashing success" because of the large

He pointed out how

Deinonychus to make

unlucky victim. 
number of scientists present. However, 
no unanimous decision was reached and 
most scientists left with 
the same 
opinions on Archaeopteryx that they had 
held before the carne. "The human 
animal is frail in the sense that we 
develop opinions or conclusions and 
unless someone presents overwhelming 
evidence that you are wrong, you tend to 
cling to your belief," Ostrom said. "When 
I 
first 
presented my theories on 
Archaeopteryx people said 'Wow, it's so 
obvious. Why didn't I think of that?' but 
were still reluctant to accept it." 


When he is not busy with conferences, 
teaching or doing research, Ostrom 
serves as the curator vertebrate paleon-
tology at the Peabody Museum. He is 
currently raising over $12,000 for a 
fleshed-out and life-size model of the 
Deinonychus for display at the Peabody.

**Excavation in Mongolia of Velociraptor**
**Page number(s): 40-41**

Excavation in Mongolia of Velo~~raptor 
takes great pride in the Peabody. "As a 
museum, it is excellent. But as a private 
university museum, the Peabody is really 
extraordinary," he said, adding that, un-
fortunately, few members of the Yale 
community take advantage of it. "I like to 
embarass my classes by asking who has 
been to the Peabody. There are actually 
students who don't know that the place 
exists." 

His pride in the museum is the rightful 
pride of a father, for many of the 
Peabody's acquisitions are the results of 
Ostrom's work. Throughout the 1960s 
Ostrom carried out a series of expedi-
tions in the West, particularly Montana 
and Wyoming, bringing back many of 
the specimens that now rest in the 
Peabody's Hall of Dinosaurs. This April, 
Ostrom "pulled a great coup for Yale," 
possibly his greatest. When Princeton 
University announced it was leaving the 
field of vertebrate paleontology, Ostrom 
immediately proposed that Yale could 
best make use of their very valuable col-
lection of fossils. 

The Princeton ad-
ministration agreed. "It's sad," Ostrom 
said, "because they have been a strong-
hold in the area for so long. But this does 
demonstrate how we put priority into 
scholarship and overcome our football 
rivalries. It's the way all academic institu-
tions should treat one another." The fact 
that Yale was competing for Princeton's 
collection with the Smithsonian, the Field 
Museum of Natural History in Chicago, 
the Carnegie Museum and the U niversi-
ty of Michigan, gives Ostrom great 
satisfaction. The collection of over 24,000 
fossils will come to Yale this month, join-
ing the Peabody's already valuable collec-
tion, which includes the original Bron-
tosaurus found and named by Yale's Pro-
fessor O.C. Marsh in the late 1800s. 

In the regions out west where Ostrom 
spent his early career, Yale now has a 
permanent geology field camp. When 
Thomas Stroock, '48, donated a ranch to 
Yale, it was considered an ideal location 
for a base camp for Yale's geology field 
course. To help shoulder the costs of 
maintaining a ranch year-round, Yale 
asked Harvard and Cornell to join the 
project and a three-way foundation was 
created. 

Located 
17 
miles from 
Saratoga, 
Wyoming in the Sierra 
Madre mountains, 
the camp was 
established in 1981 
and has been 
operating for three seasons. 

Ostrom is the only active member 
from Yale on the foundation board, and 
according to some of the students who 
have spent summers there, he is the 
backbone of the camp. Although much 
of Yale's 
geology department has 
become more theoretical, Ostrom is a 
firm believer that "you cannot learn 
geology unless you look at the rocks. 
You can sit in a class and read the text-
books, but until you really get out there 
and get your hands dirty in the field, the 
concepts are not reinforced adequately," 
Ostrom said. 

Debbie Colodner, a 
senior geoiogy major, spent last sum-
mer at the camp and readily agrees with 
Ostrom. "I learned more from that 

"You can tell that he 
really loves the land 
and wishes he could 
be back out there." 

summer at camp than I had the last 
three years of classes," said Colodner. 

Ostrom clearly loves the region, 
speaking of it as "a beautiful forested 
area. It has nice flowing brooks with 
good fishing-reaJiy nice trout," he 
said. However, Ostrom has only been 
able to visit for brief periods recently, 
due to his responsibilities and projects 
here at YaJe. "You can tell that he reaJly 
loves the land and wishes he could be 
back out there," Colodner said. 

Ostrom's 
devotion 
to 
both 
his 
students and his work is obvious in the 
way he speaks of his profession. "After 
having done this for a few years, I 
become more and more stimulated by 
the fact that life is constantly changing, 
that evolution is such a wonderful pro-
cess," Ostrom said. He feels that his 
class, "The History of Life," designed for 
students who do not plan to pursue

One Man's War 
Jay Carney 
"How could I make someone under-
stand the difference between morality 
and what happens to a man's soul when 
he leaps out of a helicopter on a combat 
assault?" wrote Jack Fuller in an article 
entitled "Getting Back to the Garden" in 
the April 1971 issue of The New journal. 
In the article, Fuller described his post-
Vietnam impressions of Yale and the 
"War at Home." 

"How could I relate ethics to the smell 
of carnage and cordite?" the article con-
tinued. "That would take a novel to 
do ... " That summer Fuller began 
writing his novel about Vietnam. In 
1984, after 13 years of writing and 
revising, Fragments was published. 

Although Fuller took over a decade to 
complete it, Fragments does not seem 
overworked. It is neither long, nor detail-
ed with factual historical references; nor 
does it have a complex plot. But what it 
does have is an immediacy that draws the 
reader into one experience of being in 
Vietnam and Cambodia during wartime. 
The prose is simple; even descriptive 
sentences are short and to the point. The 
author uses this compressed style to 
maintain tight control over the novel's 
fmely tuned characters and their inter-
relationships. Fuller leaves little ambigui-
ty about the kind of person each 
character should represent to the reader. 
Although this aspect of Fuller's style can 
make some of the novefs sequences a bit 
predictable, 
the author ultimately 
manipulates this predictability to make 
the most significant events more surpris-
ing and effective. 

Fuller draws the 
material 
for 
Fragments from his own experience in 
Vietnam. After one semester at Yale 
Law School in 1968, he was drafted into 
the U.S Army for two years, the second 
of which he spent as a combat cor-
respondent for Stars and Stripts. Fuller 
spent his year in the field with the 
"grunts," the ground infantrymen. He 
42 The New JoumalJApril 19, 1985 
got to know these men well because, 
like their civilian counterparts, cor-
respondents for Stars and Stnpes never 
carried weapons: they depended on 
grunts for protection. 

Fragments is about the grunts and the 
experiences Fuller had with them. The 
novel reads like a fresh account of non-
fiction. The two central characters are 
Bill Morgan, a careful thinker who 
looks to the facts to find the reason, and 
Jim Neumann, M organ's new friend 
and hero. Told by Morgan, a college 
graduate of the class of '68, the novel 
opens at the end of the story. M organ 
and others report to an official inquiry 
into Neumann's actions during a skir-
mish with the enem y near the village of 
Xuan The. Civilians had been killed, 
but Neumann is absolved because no 
one but he can say exactly what hap-
pened there. Then Morgan takes us to 
the beginning, to when he received his 
draft notice, began basic training, and 
first met Neumann. From here, Fuller 
carefull y 
develops 
the reader's 
understanding of the characters, their 
friendship 
and 
their circumstances 
before they reach Xuan The. This is the 
site of the novel's central event, the 
place where Fuller demonstrates the 
"difference between morality and what 
happens to a man's soul when he leaps 
out of a helicopter on a combat assault." 

The bitterness Fuller had felt when 
he returned to Yale in 1971 had driven 
him to write his article. What he could 
not communicate there, he chose to ex-
plain in a novel. But isn't it too early to 
turn into fiction an era whose facts are 
still a matter of heated debate? And isn't 
the inevitable result a romanticizing of 
even the most horrible of events? Clear-
ly, Fuller does not think so. The at-
titudes he encountered when he re-
turned from Vietnam could not be 
enlightened by more factual informa-
tion. As he did then, Fuller still belie~es

that fiction is best suited to convey his 
message about Vietnam. "Everyone had 
their own glib moral assertions to make 
about a soldier's responsibilty for his ac-
tions in Vietnam." he explained recent-
ly. "One thing that had struck me was 
how difficult it was to make any simple 
historical judgement on the event, both 
when I was there and after I had come 
back. And that's why it was so irritating 
that 
others' assumptions 
were 
so 
simple ... " 

Fuller remembered particular events 
at Yale that revealed to him disturbing 
misperceptions about the war. One 
night some law school students watch-
ing the news were cheering "as though it 
had been a H arvard-Yale game" when 
the North Vietnamese Army crossed a 
demilitarized zone during a large-scale

invasion in 1972. Other times he found 
it hard to watch students waving a 
:-.;orth Vietnamese banner. Said Fuller, 
"People seemed to think this was a 
match in which U.S. failure would 
somehow lead to humane results." H e 
makes no intentional political statement 
in Fragmnzts on the propriety of U .S. in-
volvement in Vietnam. But he does 
make a personal statement, one ad-
dressed to anyone who would self-
righteously reduce the question of 
behavior in Vietnam to a simple right 
or wrong. In combat. morality becomes 
equivocal. "Soldiers were thrown into 
tragic situations where decisions made 
in a split-second might come back to 
haunt them endlessly," Fuller said. 
"And then there is the idea of respon-
siblity and freedom linked to thi central 
ambiguity ... because it's hard to ex-
cuse one's own self when the facts alone 
don't explain what you did.~ Fra(!mmts is 
Fuller's absolution for every American 
soldier who ever found that a rational 
account o f the facts fell short of supply-
ing an explanation for what had hap-
pened to him. But it also means to <:how 
those 
soldiers that ultimate!} 
the 
responsibility for their actions dors lie 
with them selves. Although this respon-
sibility is fraught with moral ambiguity. 
Fuller believes that accepting it is an 
assertion of one's freedom. 
In Fragmnrts, 
~forgan is like the 
many soldiers who continuallv try to 
find concrete explanations for \"hat has 
happened. He looks to the circum-
stances that man cannot control to find 
the<:e . explanations, hoping they will 
serve to absolve people of their respon-
siblity. For Morgan the controlling 
forces in Vietnam are "chance and 
necessity. That was all there was to it. 
As much as you hated the odds, hated 
the brute, amoral powers of the jungle, 
you had to cling to them. They left no 
room for blame." Once he comes home, 
Morgan 
fights 
with 
all 
unanswered quc'ltions in his memory of 
Xuan The. The facts he has, the 
fragments, do not fit together into a 
w holt·. do not make the connections 
that would free Neumann of rc pon-
sibility. Although in the final s ene of 
the novel Morgan has all the informa-
tion from Neumann that he had not 
previously known, his desire to <,um up 
the event, to put it on the shdf under 
the heading "Chance and 1'\ecessity," is 
ultimately frustrated. Neumann cannot 
be absolved; the responsibilty is his. 
Acknowledging this, the reader will 
have to make his own estimation of the 
moralitv invoh ed. if anv at all. 
One ·might easily su'spect there is 
a strong autobiographical relation be-
tween the author and Morgan. But 
Fuller explained that he wanted to 
separate his characters from himself as 
much as possible in order to maintain a 
more objective critical eye. Perhaps 
Fuller created Morgan as a link be-
tween himself and those who did not go 
to Vtetnam, those for whom he wrote

Slavery and Human Progress 
by David Brion Davis 
1984 Oxford University Press 
For most Americans the word "slavery" 
conjures up images of the antebellum 
deep South, of overseers with whips and 
blacks in cotton fields. Yet the institu-
tion of slavery dates back to the start of 
recorded history in Mesopotamia, and 
it was not even until the late 18th cen-
tury that slavery was considered a sin 
against morality. Instead, slavery was 
generally thought to be a system of 
labor which benefitted both captor and 
captive, condoned by governments and 
churches in all parts of the world. 
Sterling Professor of History David 
Brion Davis has spent most of his 
academic career studying the problem 
of slavery, and his new book, Slavery and 
Human Progress, continues his writing on 
the subject. The book is an ambitious 
mixture of historical 
research and 
Davis's own "moral philosophy," a com-
bination which gives the book an emo-
tional impact very rare and very 
welcome in historical writing. 
Davis's 
thesis 
is simple but 
fascinating: slavery has always been in-
extricably linked with changing con-
cepts of "progress," and in mockrn 
history there has been a "momentous 
shift from 'progressive' enslavement to 
'progressive' emancipation." He writes, 
"From Plato onward even the visions of 
a utopian society toward which humans 
might evolve assumed the continuing 
existence of slaves. 
Progress, 
however conceived in 
the ancient 
world, 
was 
fully 
compatible with 
human 
bondage." For Christians, 
Muslims and Jews alike, religion sanc-
tified the enslavement of"outsiders" who 
would receive, in theory, the benefits of 
a superior civilization and religion. In 
one instance, "Papal briefs of the 1450s 
authorized the Portuguese King or 
Order of Christ to conquer and reduce 
44 The New JoumaVApril 19, 1985 
David Brion Davis lecturing in WLH 
to 
perpetual 
slavery the infidels, 
pagans, unbelievers, and enemies of 
Christ . . . " The enemies of Christ were 
not necessarily blacks, however; such 
physical distinctions were attributed to 
factors like climate and environment. 
But inspired by Biblical language, non-
blacks began to associate the color with 
things dangerous and unholy, and such 
feelings were easy to transfer to black 
Africans. 
Nonetheless, slavery did not become 
widely entrenched in modern Europe 
until after the Black Death of the 14th 
century, when Europeans desperate for 
a labor force increasingly turned to 
African slavery. Over the course of cen-
turies 
European 
slave 
trade 
developed into a hugely profitable in-
dustry which helped ensure nations' 
economic growth. As Davis argues, "the 
vast majority of eighteenth-century 
policymakers and commentators 
equated slaves with wealth and national 
greatness." Tragically, it was indeed 
true that slaves played a vital part in the 
expansion and progress of Western 
civilization. 

But the nineteenth century brought 
momentous changes 
for 
enslaved 
blacks. Britain would outlaw slavery in 
the West Indies in 1833; the United 
States fought a civil war, in part 
because of agitation over chattel 
slavery; France, Brazil and numerous 
other countries would abolish slavery in 
their domains before the century ended. 
According to Davis, "The Western 
world was beginning to view slavery as 
an intolerable obstacle to human pro-
gress-as an economic <f{lachronism as 
well as an offense to Christian morality 


and human rights." For Davis, the next 
question is what caused this immense 
shift in ideals of progress and attitudes 
toward slavery. 

T o find an answer, Davis looks close-
ly at the history of the abolitionist 
movement in Great Britain, the first 
"civilized" country to abolish slavery. 
British 
abolitionism began with 
a 
Quaker revival in the 1770s, a move-
ment which confronted the paradox of 
slavery in a country that prided itself on 
setting a moral example for the rest of 
the world. The Quakers' rejection of 
slavery spread to other religious groups, 
and in time the denunciation of slavery 
became a religious rite of purification 
akin to renouncing drinking, gambling 
and other sinful forms of "worldliness" 
As Davis writes, "Testimony against 
slavery became a crucial symbol of 
'serious religion.'" 
Evangelical 
abolitionists 
argued that slavery had become an im-
passible obstacle to the country's pro-
gress. It was an institution that had no 
moral, religious or economic justifica-
tion for being. Yet the abolitionists as 
well as their opponents feared the 
eradication of slavery would mean the 
collapse of the British 
plantation 
economy in the West Indies, and 
theorized 
that 
emancipated 
slaves 
would (and should) still be bound to 
their former masters. Predicted aboli-
tionist James Stephen, "The dread of 
starving" will be "substituted for the dread 
of being flogged." Similarly, 
both 
groups feared that freeing the slaves 
would create a permanent underclass of 
indolent and possibly rebellious blacks. 
In his explanation of how the British 
government gradually took up the cause 
of emancipation, Davis reveals his 
esteem for any government that would 
act against its economic and diplomatic 
interests for the sake of human rights. 
Though cognizant of the pragmatic 
arguments against emancipation, the 
British Parliament clearly favored the 
cause of humanity, both in their own 
territories and in foreign lands.

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Davis thoughtfully concludes, "This 
abstracted concern for human rights 
ran counter to the normal assumptions 
and procedures of law and has hardly 
been a prominent theme in human 
history." 

Moving beyond Great Britain, Davis 
explores the years after English eman· 
cipation, which he terms "a century of 
progress." Britain's example 
forced 
much of the rest of the world to recon· 
sider its moral stance on slavery; no 
country which wished to be progressive 
could permit slavery within its borders. 
No longer would governments and 
churches worldwide speak of the "pro-
gressive" nature of slavery and expect to 
hear praise for their morality. 

But Davis ends on a disturbing note, 
asking whether slavery has really disap-
peared from the world or simply taken 
new forms. He points to labor camps in 
the USSR, Jews forced to work in fac-
tories in World War II Germany and 
the oppression of indigenous peasants 
in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Clearly 
Davis feels that the 20th century has not 
rid itself of the forced use of human 
labor. 

Slavery and Human Progress is an im-
pressive book, though not without its 
flaws. In many instances the awesome 
scope of Davis's study -literally, the 
history of recorded civilization- makes 
it impossible for him to examine his 
subject as thoroughly as it merits. There 
are instances where his treatment of 
issues is glaringly superficial, most 
noticeably in his examination of eman-
cipation in France and Brazil. 

But to •his credit, Davis makes no 
claims of being able to do justice to all 
this information, and therefore much of 
the book has an informal, almost 
talkative tone. Davis seems more con· 
cerned with raising qu.estions of morali-
ty and progress than with answering 
them, an approach which has left some 
academic critics dissatisfied, but works 
for the reader who prefers a candid ap-
proach toward issues of morality rather · 
than a dry and apparently omniscient 
historical treatise. In Slavery and Human 
Progress, David Brion Davis proves that 
he has the breadth of knowledge to at· 
tempt a study as immense as this. Even 
more impressively, he demonstrates the 
intellectual honesty to admit that no in· 
dividual can answer the disturbing 
question of how men could enslave 
other men, all in the name of progress.

As both white and black abolitionists discovered, emancipation could be even 
mOI'e effectively blocked by men who believed in progress than by those who 
fatalisticaDy resigned themselves to the sins of this world .... To speak of the 
idea of progress as an oiJstDcll to emancipation may be troubling for people who 
would like to translate aD historical problems into binary choices . . . U nfor· 
tunattely, the problems we are exploring are much too complicated for yes-or-no 
answers. This is not to say that muddy thinking can be justifw:d by references to 
6fe's oonc:lusions. For thoee of us who still think of history as a kind of moral 
phibophy teaching tiy examples. it is precisely the moral character of 
truth-the varied 8IJ8Ies of vision that are also the subject of imaginative 
literature-that cne must seek to capture. If such inquiry has any 'therapeutic' 
value, it arises from the diac:overy that the most comforting and reassuring 
facets ol meaning ... are not the only dimensions of historical experience.

**Afterthought**
**Author: Molly Armstrong**
**Page number(s): 47**

This issue's Aflnthought cvmes from an interview with Molly Armstrong, 
CC '84 who was an American Studies mqjor. 7he interview was ediud by 
joyce &n")tt, ediwr-in-chiej of The New Journal. 

Like many Yale alumni, I work in New York City. Every morn-
ing, I lea\e my room and "''alk past 42nd Street, past peep shows 
and bookstores, to a large, horseshoe-shaped building just off 
Times ~uare. As one of the volunteers here at Covenant 
House, a short-term crisis center for homeless youth, my work 
day begins at eight a.m., when I get all the girls over 18 out on a 
jobsearch. Then, I review the new cases, the kids who walked in-
to the c;hdtcr just last night. Usually, we have 200 children stay-
ing at the House, although there are only 110 beds. Mats on the 
floor and couches in TV rooms substitute temporarily for the 
street or sub\\ay trains. We give them towels and sheets, feed 
and sometimes clothe them. 

CO\enant House is a sanctuary. The kids here, all under 21, 
are running, either from a pimp or a family or a group home. 
Their experiences match nothing we think of as typical of 
childhood. I contact a child's parents on[y with her permission, 
and the House reunites a good portion of the children with their 
families, prO\ided no abuse is involved. The average stay is six 
days, too little time to change their lives. Because I must con-
stantly choose between imperfect solutions, my idea of success 
has changed. Success here only occurs on a small scale. 

Along v.ith handing out toilet paper and serving meals, I 
"crisis counser- talking down the suicidal, breaking up fights 
~1o:.tlv I deal with children who have always thought no one 
cared ·\\hethcr thev lived or died. I get hugs and curses, but all I 
do throughout is listen. always listen. 

I alway enjoyed listening. I loved being fresJu:t~ counselor, 
and because I \\as such a good listener. I almost dtdn t graduate. 
As graduation approached, however, I realized that "good 
listener" could not be listed on my resume. In fact, I could list 
fe"' concrete achievements, and yet I believed I had to fmd a 
career immediately. at 21. .The more I looked for a job, the 
more confused I became. Finally, I turned to examine the 
resourct•s I had, namely, myself. Young and without obligations, 
I knew I could take chances; I was free to do anything. I decided 
then not to foUow the standard Yale senior route of resumes and 
CAPS. Stank\ Kaplan and graduate .;chool. 

Fe\" people felt as I did. Like m)"'Clf, they had debts to pay 
off, and o:o they needed to earn sizable salaries. But I felt more 
than the need to succeed fmancially, I felt the need to grow. In-
stead of reading theory and discussing hypothetical situations, I 
itched to go out and act. I wanted to test myself and felt I could 
through volunteer work. 

M y parents and my close friends understood and supported 
my decision. However, others who were only acquaintances 
began to feel uneasy around me. I knew my decision was my 
own, not a judgement on the actions of other people. But at a 
time when seniors have to think about their responsibilities to 
family or debt or tradition, some people made choices they were 
uncomfortable with. Perhaps they were like a friend of mine 
who graduated two years before me. H is freshman year he 
picketed Morgan Stanley for some of their activities in the Third 
World. Senior year he applied for a job with them when he saw 
the fmancial responsibilities awaiting him. 

In the city, I occasionally run into other Yalies on the street. I 
have nothing in common anymore with most of them. We made 
such choices that our lifestyles simply do not overlap. 

For my work at Covenant House, I receive 12 dollars a 
week, room and board. The House is a Catholic institution, and 
I live in the lay religious community attached to it. The 
volunteers, ranging from 22 to 71 years of age, sign up for a 13 
month stint, the frrst month devoted entirely to training. 

My work as a tutor of the behaviorally disturbed at Troup 
Junior High in New Haven exposed me, if only on a small scale, 
to the kind of children I deal with at Covenant House. We have 
a policy of open intake, meaning we accept any child who walks 
through our doors: those with a criminal or psychiatric history, 
chronic runaways, abuse cases and the resourceless. 

After seven months, I do not feel burned out. Rather, I am 
forced to examine assumptions about the world I never knew I 
had. For example, my views concerning male-female relation-
ships are constantly challenged here. The only affection many of 
these children have known has been within sexual relationships. 
In fact, Covenant H ouse has a whole floor of mothers and 
b.d>ies. A girl would not get an abortion because her child is all 
she has. 

What I'm doing now I know I can't do forever: the stress fac-
tor is too high and the intensity will wear thin. But I know I have 
made the right decision. M y schooling did not end when I left 
the University. I will continue to learn from children who are 
alone. from those who have nowhere to go. AD I must do is 
listen.
