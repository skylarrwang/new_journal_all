**Soaring Over New Haven**

New Haven wakes up late. The first bus 
leaving the Green for Lighthouse Point is 
deserted, and the ride through the silent city 
in the early morning darkness shows empty 
streets and closed stores. The silence is even 
more pronounced in the empty field where 
the bus makes its last stop. At 6:55 on this 
chi.lly September morning, three older men 
are standing near the perimeter, with 
binoculars pointed skyward. They don't say 
much, quiet with their expectation of the 
rising sun and soaring hawk. After all, the 
weeks between September 15 and October 15 
are the rush hour of hawk migration season, 
and today's Northeast winds carry the promise 
of a busy day of hawk-watching.

As the sun climbs above the tree line, the 
whitewashed lighthouse reflects a brilliant 
yellow, but the hawk-watchers don't seem to 
notice. Their squints are all directed vertically, 
scanning the sky for any sign of their prey. 
They are glad to feel the sun, though; .as the 
thermal energy heats the air, it gives the hawks 
the lift they need to soar.

Lighthouse Point lies in the migratory 
path of hawks headed south for the winter, 
making it one of the best spots on the East 
coast for bird-watchers. The New Haven Bird 
Club organizes the hawk-watch here every day 
in the late summer and early fall. It is open to 
anyone, and the Yale Ornithological Society is 
often in attendance. Last year when Yale 
professor of organismal biology John Moore 
taught "Biology of Birds," many Yale students 
carne to the watches. There are usually about 
a dozen of the faithful 
present.

Today 
should 
be 
crowded, with a 
bird club from 
Allen, 
0croBER IJ, 1995
Connecticut expected and a children's nature 
walk scheduled.

Fourteen kinds of hawks have been seen 
here, with six primary species passing 
overhead regularly: Sharp-shinned, Osprey, 
Northern Harrier, Merlin, American Kestral, 
and Cooper's Hawk.

Despite the favorable winds, today starts 
out slowly. The first hawk, an Osprey, doesn't 
make an appearance until 7:55. The sight of 
the brilliant white underside of its black-
tipped wings ends a long cold hour of 
anticipation. By 8:30, there are 15 cars in the 
parking lot, and a group of ten children are 
preparing for their nature walk.

On most days when a few hundred hawks 
pass overhead, the flurry of activity in the air 
is mirrored on the ground, as binoculars turn 
in unison towards the direction called out by 
the first viewer. At these times, Ronald Bell, 
the hawk-watch coordinator, listens for the 
voices he can trust to report to him the 
passing hawks, as he keeps a record for the 
national organization that tracks the hawk 
migratory patterns.

In the forest bordering the field, Jim Zipp, 
a New Haven Park Ranger, crouches among 
the trees with a cage of small birds like 
pigeons. When he spots a hawk passing, he 
gets these birds to flutter their feathers to 
attract the hawk. Zipp then catches the hawks 
and bands them so their migratory parterns 
can be studied further. When he catches a rare 
species, Zipp usually brings it to the bird-
watchers for them to ogle before he sets it free.

Today turns out to be a very slow day of 
hawk-watching. By 9 a.m. only a handful of 
hawks have passed by. But like fishing, the joy 
of hawk-watching isn't so much in the catch. 
As weekend-watcher Wllford Shultz sees it, 
"The worst day of hawk-watching is better 
than the best day at work."

On a slow day like this, the hawk-
watchers lapse into stories of past glory. They 
talk about the day last year when a peregrine 
falcon chasing a swan came right into the 
field. Or the day when a "sharpie" {a sharp-
shinned hawk) killed a warbler in the field. 
Then, there's the story of an exquisite red-
tailed hawk living a few miles from Lghthouse 
Point, which a privileged few have seen.

The crowd thins out around I 0 a.m., 
heading home with inevitable neck cramps. 
Some of the most dedicated will stay late into 
the afternoon.

When the bus returns ro the Green, it's 
hard to believe that it's the same city that had 
been so quiet just a few hours earlier. The 
mall is already crawling with activity, and the 
bus stops are crowded. A speeding car with 
music blaring frightens some unobserved 
pigeons, who hop and Auner around the hot 
dog stand on the corner.
