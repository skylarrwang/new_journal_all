WELCOME TO TEMPLE BETH-EL SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. DO NOT ENTER WHILE CONGREGATION IS STANDING AT PRAYER. DO NOT WALK IN FRONT OF ALTAR," warned the sign at the entrance to the sanctuary. It was past eight o'clock, already winter dark; the lobby was dim, the sanctuary was lit, and a man wearing an Anti-Defamation League tie pin was lurking behind the door. The usher flinched slightly as I walked in. "Oh," he sighed, "you're here for Art Riklin."

"My grandfather," I apologized. "You will know him by his tie pin-"

Art, my grandfather of the ADL, stopped lurking, marched forward, took my right forearm in both hands, and hauled me to our seats, pretending that he meant only to kiss me hello. "You come here often, hmm?" he asked, and fixed me with a decent rendition of my uncle Eddie's leer.

"Day and niiiight ... " I said.

"Night and day!" he sang, on key.

"Cole Porter went to Yale. Class of '13."

"But you're late!" he said, tightening his grip on my arm. The cantor walked in, the congregation began the opening hymn, and we looked around for pillars of the community with whom we would exchange greetings after services.

"Malachti hashartit," said the cantor.

"Malachei haelyon," replied my grandfather and I. He held the prayerbook in one hand, straightening his arm so that the page was directly in front of my eyes. With the index finger of his free hand, he jabbed the appropriate syllable in time with the chant, lest we get lost in the Hebrew. This was, of course, as much for his benefit as for my own. We were six words into the Sabbath and had yet to lose our place. No one should ever go to services alone.


Art's son, my stepfather Scot, tried to laugh me out of an attack of anticipatory worry in the days before I left for New Haven. "You will look around and ask yourself, 'Diaspora? What diaspora? What happened to the exile, the dispersion?' There are so many Jews up there, Sarah. Compared to San Antonio, New Haven looks like Jerusalem. You will be in the land of The New York Times, and I, Scot Riklin-and my pork-eating, Christmas-celebrating brethren-will still be here."

"I'm scared."

"I don't often indulge in my parental advice urge, Sarah, or in the major Jewish cliches-but please try to be a mensch about this."

"It will be difficult not to be. They tell me that the horrible maelstrom of menschcn, the contingent of cliche itself, is building some sort of 'center for Jewish life' right near Timothy Dwight."

He took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and sighed. "Oh, no. No. Don't tell me that, please. I'll worry."

"Blintzes, Scot! On demand." We take our blintzes very seriously, but we like them better when it is not a rabbi, but instead a wild hog from the West Texas underbrush, who supervises their preparation.

"There is no good kosher food! No such thing! You know that."

"I'll be careful."

"I'd hate to see you get sucked into all that," he said.


"I adjure you, O daughter of Jerusalem!" I yelled at my unwitting and newly-arrived suitemate. "Why would you awaken the rabbi, or stir it up, until it please?" The Biblical "Song of Songs" did not make appropriate moving-day small talk. Nor, indeed, did I think that my visiting the Hillel rabbi was a suitable moving-day activity.

"Aren't you Jewish?" asked my roommate.

"Yes," I replied, with a straight face.

"You seem to have some problem with rabbis."

"Yes!"

"But you're Jewish-"

"It is because I am a Jew that I have this fear! Gentiles don't have to worry."

"Why are you going to see the rabbi, if it's so hard on you?"

"Someone at home--my natal rabbi, in fact-sent the Hillelim a letter, warning them that I was coming. It is good to infiltrate the hierarchy. My grandfather would be proud."


The Slifka Center is hardly half a block from Timothy Dwight College. However much I had once delighted in driving a car on the Sabbath, it looked like now I would be walking to services. With less effort than I cared to admit, I could make out the Hebrew on the sign: "Beit Josef," "school of Joseph [Slifka]," it said. The language wore out my patience, however, and I went inside to start my infiltration, finding not one, but two rabbis.

"Oh, you're Sarah Bedel," one said. "We got the letter. Marvelous! Wonderful letter. Were you sent a copy?" Courtesy, goodwill, and glee-all familiar, all appropriately rabbinical, and all much appreciated by this sojourner in a strange land.

"It is good to meet you both-"

"I am Jim Ponet. I am the director of Hillel. This is my colleague-"

"Sharon Cohen-Anisfeld. Pleasure to meet you."
