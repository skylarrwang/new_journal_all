The Tap Night Riots 
A 
lone student staggers a!lgrily across the darkened Old 
Campus. A Road Warrior, post-apocalyptic, he is 
surrounded by rubble-shreds of rubber, paper, beer 
bonles, golf balls-that he does not notice. He is angry. 
Blood drips from his arm, and he screams for his enemies. 
"Where are they?!" His voice echoes off the indifferent walls of 
Farnam and Lawrence Halls. "Those assholes beat me up!" 
Nobody responds. 
He is calling for the Duke's Men. 
The Duke's Men are generally known to be a singing 
ensemble. Like most other Yale singing groups, they rehearse 
several times a week to hone their particular blend of a cappella 
music. While it is entirely possible that the Duke's Men include 
combat drills as part of their vocal warm-ups, there has been little 
previous evidence in their 43-year hiswry at Yale to suggest that 
they are in any way a fighting unit. 
So why is the Road Warrior so angry? 
Geoff Blanford (TO '97) waits at University Health Services 
for stitches for the fresh gash that prominently mars his forehead. 
Geoff has a large body, the kind required of bouncers and football 
players. When he steps forward to give his social security number, 
the woman behind the desk looks up at his painted face and asks 
what happened. 
"It is difficult to explain," he starts, the blood still fresh on his 
skin. "You see, I'm in a singing group ... " 
0croBÂ£R IJ, 1995 


Vanderbilt Hall is an interesting place to be at 11:30 p.m. on 
September 28. In less than an hour, Geoff will receive the head 
wound that will send him to UHS. Presently, Michael Bakkensen 
(BR '96), dressed in white face paint and enjoying the adrenaline 
rush of anticipation, addresses the throng of people assembled 
beneath the archway. Some of these people he has designated as 
"blood donors," others as "semen donors." Bakkensen, after 
delivering specific instructions to each group, ends the rally by 
shouting a command: 
"Kic~ the shit out of every singing group you see!" 


At 12:10 a.m., the Whiffenpoofs are finally singing and are 
glad to be holding torches. About 500 people surround their 
dimly lit faces; maybe 200 in front of them and 300 behind. 
Those in front are packed around the steel-grate doors of High 
Street Gate, some clad in bright yellow bowling shim, others in 
marching black denim jackets. Many wear blue jeans. Geoff (pre-
injury) and his friends in the Baker's Dozen are here, sporting 
tribal warpaint on their faces and matching green shirts. These 
200-some oddly-dressed students are the members of Yale's a 
cappella singing group community, gathered together tonight for 
their annual Tap Night festivities, and they are anxious for the 
Whiffenpoofs to stop singing. 


When the final chord of "Wake, Freshmen, Wake" has 
sounded, the singers, armed with only their matching clothing, 
silver chalices and high adrenaline levels, will storm the Old 


Hundreds of other anti-singing-
group Yalies lie in wair further 
away from the High Street Gate. 
Some are lone thrill-seekers with nothing 
to do, but many others are war generals 
who have been battle-planning for days. 
Daniel Lyons (SM '98) is one such 
warrior, arguably the highest-ranking 
aqua-general on Yale's campus tonight. 
Daniel is largely responsible for the 
impressive crowd of nearly 300 gathered 
inside the Silliman courtyard, far from the 
Tap Night epicenter at the High Street 
Gate. He is the founder of S.P.L.A.S.H. 
(Soak and Punish Loud A Cappella Singing 
Hordes), an organization dedicated to 
providing appropriate ammunition and 
motivation to members of Silliman 
College. Under the watchful eye of 
Silliman Master Kelly Brownell, Daniel 
has distributed flyers and posters inviting 
Sillimanders to come out and defend their 
college from singers. He has even written 
a letter to The Yale Daily News 
warning, "we are going, in all means 
possible, to distribute a great quantity of 
water upon the singing groups." Daniel 
boasted to the News, "If an officer [of the 
law] is present on Tap Night, I shall try 
my hardest not to hit him when I am 
throwing water balloons. But hey, 
accidents do happen." 


This letter was brought to the 
attention of the Yale Police by the Singing 
Group Council yesterday afternoon. The 
response from the officer on duty was "I 
hope he does hit me with a balloon," 
ac~ompanied, one presumes, ~ith a wry 
grm. 


Luckily for both parties involved, 
Daniel and the two Yale Police officers 
nearby are stationed on opposite sides of 
the Silliman gate, and the crowd is saving 
its water for the singers. 


As the Whiffs sing at High Street, the 
frosh of Saybrook and Pierson Colleges 
prepare to "take back" Lanman-Wright 
Hall. The enemy from whom they hope to 
reclaim their dorm is an amorphous 
conglomerate of Yale organizations: 
improv comedy troupes, fraternities, 
athletic teams and, of course, singing 
groups. In the past two weeks, 
organizations of all four types have 
interrupted the serene nocturnal quiet of 
Lanman-Wright with loud, often drunken 
disturbances, and now, before chronic 
sleep deprivation permanently depletes 
their energy stores, the frosh are going to 
strike back. 


Santosh Aravind (PC '99) is not sure 
exactly what this rebellion will entail. He 
is aware of a fellow Wright resident who 
has anonymously threatened (again, 
through The Yale Daily News) to urinate 
out of his window onto passing singers. 
Drunk as he -knows many of his friends to 
be, Santosh does not consider this 
possibility a longshot. Brian Garland (PC 
'99) in the same YDN article, has hinted 
that the defense will be built from 
stronger stuff than water balloons. "From 
what I've heard, were I anyone that even 
remotely resembled a singing group 
member, I would steer clear of Wright 
Hall on Tap Night," he says. 


Valiantly, the Whiffenpoofs sing. 
Their concert is only a song-and-a-
half old, and already one member 
has been egged, several others doused with 
. an incredibly sticky red sauce, courtesy of 
Bakkenson's "blood donors." The crowd 
of 300 behind them is responsible for this, 
as well as for the loud interrupting 
interludes of "Hey, Jude," "Meet the 
Flintstones" and "Row, Row, Row Your 
Boat" that have drowned out parts of the 
set. No Whiffs have yet broken rank, 
though the senior men have agreed to use 
their torches to fend off attackers if any 
one of them is touched in person. 


Only the few singing group members 
directly in front of the Whiffs can hear 
the concert well, and so it is only these 
few people that get to enjoy hearing James 
Gore (TC '96) sing his solo line in the 
middle of "Eli's Comin'": "Eli's comin', 
gonna kick your ass, fool!" 


Those aren't the real words, are they, 
James? 


This is not the first Tap Night in 
which water will have played a prominent 
role. The past few years have witnessed a 
growing fad of aqueous assault against 
singing groups, with Silliman College 
leading the way. On Tap Night last year,


Rachel Garcia (TO '97), a member of 
Redhot & Blue, slipped on a staircase that 
had been doused with water and was 
knocked unconscious. Witnesses who saw 
the treatment of Jean McLeod (CC '97), a 
member of Something Extra, in the 
courtyard of Silliman that same night, said 
that it had strong overtones of sexual 
harassment. Two men grabbed an arm 
each and held her in place, while several 
others dumped buckets of water over her 
head. Something Extra wore white tap 
shirts that year. 


This year, in an attempt to keep the 
fun within the limits of decency, the 
Silliman Dean's office has issued official 
"Rules of Waterplay." These include "No 
throwing water from windows," "No 
aiming for the head," and the ever-
important "Nothing but water." Dean 
Flick is confident that no harm can come 
from safely-played water spores. Erin 
Callahan (SM '96) a member of Some-
thing Extra and Whim 'n' Rhythm, called 
Dean Hugh Flick today in hopes that he 
would somehow discourage the pending 
assault. He has done nothing of the sort. 


The song ends and bedlam descends 
upon the Old Campus. The singers 
scramble away from the gate, 
challenged immediately by a line of 
several dozen students who have formed a 
human chain and are chanting "hold that 
line, hold that line." The line holds for 
only a few moments; tooth marks on the 
arms of several students indicate that it 
has been chewed apart. 


Within moments, the BDs are 
attempting to enter Vanderbilt Hall. A 
massive barricade built from garbage cans 
and assorted human beings blocks their
