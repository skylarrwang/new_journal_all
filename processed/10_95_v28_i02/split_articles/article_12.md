'98). Soaking sing~rs is fun! 
path inro the entryway, a barricade that 
constitutes 
both 
a 
triumph 
of 
undergraduate ingenuity as well as an 
unbelievable fire hazard. It completely 
stops traffic. Standing atop this L~s 
Miurabi~s-esque construction stands 
Doug Rubinson (BR '98). He has a whip 
in one hand and a jug of wine in the 
other. 
"Bring it on, you morherfuckers!" he 
yells. 
One by one, the Baker's Dozen do. 
Several manage to pass Doug's perch 
without incident. One, however, does not. 
Big hands grab Doug under the armpits 
and set him down on rhe ground, wine 
and whip still in hand. Before he has rime 
to react, he has been clinched in a 
headlock and is being punched repeatedly 
in the face. An observer will later recall 
that it looked as if Doug would 
"disintegrate" 
under 
the 
blows. 
Thankfully, he does not, nor does he 
report to University Health Services for 
his injuries. 
Meanwhile, Geoff is hit in the head 
with a garbage can while navigating the 
barricade. Undaunted, he and Doug's 
assailant run through the archway and up 
an entryway to fulfill their mission of 
welcoming a freshman into their singing 
group. 


The Society of Orpheus and Bacchus 
is in the process of rapping a freshman in 
Lanman-Wright Hall. Down in the 
courtyard, Nat Fogg (BK '97) waits 
inconspicuously, wearing not so much as a 
T-shirt or a pin to identify himself as a 
singer. He notices a student, presumably a 
freshman, standing in the next enrryway 
over, 
nervously 
cradling 
fire 
extinguisher, and gradually realizes that 
the guy is planning to spray the thing. 
The SOBs run out of the entryway, and 
he starts shooting clouds of sulfur dust 
toward their faces. The 30 or so people 
standing around and watching don't 
notice or don't care. Nat is having trouble 
breathing and runs over to stop the attack. 
As he approaches, the extinguisher turns 
slightly and belches into his face, 
temporarily blinding him. 
The rwo students fall on the ground, 
exchanging furious punches. At last, 
residenrs of Wright Hall and several 
S.O.Bs separate rhe two, who continue 
exchanging screamed threats. Neither 
knows the other's name; Nat has never 
been in such a fistfighr before. 
Nor far away, Santosh Aravind ts 
vomiting from the smell of sulfur. 
The men and women of Redhot & 
Blue are assembled in the shadows of Wall 
Street, rapping a new member. They have 
called on a blue phone and asked her to 
join them outside rather than conducting 
rhe ceremony in her room. They are 
trying to avoid a confrontation with 
S.P.L.A.S.H. 
Unannounced and uninvited, Daniel 
Lyons comes barreling down Wall Street 
with a bucker of water and scores of 
S.P.L.A.S.H. infantry close behind. The 
ceremony is cur short and Redhot

members flee. They will finish tapping 
this woman days later in the sanctity of El 
Amigo Felix. 
While the Alley Cats, who have 
already navigated the Silligaundet on the 
way in, tap a member of Silliman's 
freshman class, senior Alley Cat and 
Whiffenpoof Josh Adler OE '96) talks to a 
S.P.L.A.S.H. participant down below in 
the archway. 
"What are you doing?" asks Josh. The 
other guy is holding a water balloon. 
"None of your business." 
"You're throwing water balloons at my 
friends." 
"It's just good fun ... " responds the 
balloon-holder, hoping the conversation 
will end soon. 
"You think hurting people is fun? 
Singing is fun! Hurting people is crazy!" 
The injuries mount. Fistfights all 
around. Water everywhere. A prankster in 
Silliman hits a BD alum in the back with 
a water balloon. The alum, who happens 
to be a Marine, knocks him quickly and 
heavily. to the ground. An older Duke's 
Men alum- Class of '74- is doused at 
point-blank range with a recycling bin's 
worth of water, and issues the challenge 
"Let's go!" to his attacker as water drips 
from his moustache. A student visiting 
from Connecticut College finds herself 
lifted off the ground by two strange men, 
who forcibly pry a garden hose out of her 
hands, cutting her arm in the process. 
Urine is dumped out of a window in 
Durfee Hall. And, of course, at some 
point in the evening, the Road Warrior is 
waylaid by one or many Duke's Men, 
inciting him to roam the night long after 
most of the combatants call it an evening.

Finally, Tap Night ends. The singing 
groups, having replenished their ranks, 
adjourn to privately celebrate with their 
new taps. Responding to a disturbing-the-
peace call, the Yale Police rush to Calhoun 
College and break up a Spizzwinks (?) 
parry before things get our of control. 


I
t is another Friday as usual at Yale 
University. Frisbee-players dot the Old 
Campus, and Duke's Man Dorian 
Rivers (SM '96) walks down the flagstone 
path, keeping a wary eye out for the Road 
Warrior. He wonders if he should be 
wearing his Tap Shirr our in public, then 
laughs at the thought. The sun is out 
today, the memory of last night seems no 
more than a nightmare. 
Yet still: Geoff Blanford has stitches in 
his head, and two students in Branford 
may still be able to see tooth indentations 
in their arms. 
Silliman Master Kelly Brownell 
expresses no public remorse over the mob 
scene in that took place in his college. 
S.P.L.A.S.H. organizer Daniel Lyons is 
proud of the event, proud of his college's 
spirit and proud of the 'restraint and 
control showed by Sillimanders. Dean 
Betty Trachtenberg, on the other hand, 
calls Tap Night "a sorry day for Yale 
College." 
Sanrosh Aravind agrees. "It was 
supposed to be fun, something for frosh 
to bond over, but people took things 
much too far." 
Perhaps the most difficult aspect of 
Tap Night is the lack of coherent and 
reliable information about what really 
happened. Few students that took part in 
the commotion are willing to talk about 
it. "I am scared to mention my name," 
Strange as it may seem, 
there is still a strong fear 
around campus that 
scores have yet to be 
settled, that the Road 
Warrior is still angry. 
one of the anonymous contributors to this 
article tells me. "I don't want people 
looking me up and coming after me." A 
woman who witnessed the urine dumped 
out of Durfee Hall feels similarly, despite 
the fact that her testimony names no 
specific person or group of people. 
Strange as it may seem, there is still a 
strong fear around campus that scores 
have yet to be settled, that the Road 
Due to this fear, the process of atoning 
for the violence and preventing its 
recurrence will be a difficult one. The 
singing group community plans to present 
a coherent, unified plan to the 
administration outlining proposed 
changes for next year's Tap Night, but is 
still in the process of collecting verifiable 
information and testimony about this 
year's fiasco. Dean of Student Affairs Betty 
Trachtenberg, who oversees the rush 
process, has already mentioned the 
possibility of switching over to a "sealed 
envelope" selection system similar to that 
already in use at Stanford, thereby 
threatening to eliminate one of Yale's most 
unique traditions. 
As students wait to hear the fate of 
Tap Night, administrators puzzle over an 
event that, this year, proved to be more 
than fun and games.
