In eight months, as a member of the class 
of '96, you'Ll leave the Gothic sanctity of Yale 
in pursuit of wealth, honor, and altruism. 
Equipped with a philosophy degree and an 
unequaled, four-year experience, you've 
scouted the outer reaches of the post-New 
Haven world. Graduate school? Law? Med 
school? Still frustrated? Well then, what about 
dubbing 1V shows into Spanish and working 
as a part-time receptionist at a trendy hair 
salon?

Jackie Guerra, one of sitcom's newest stars, 
undertakes such a career on her show, First 
Time Out. Only three weeks into its first 
season, the show, featuring Guerra playing a 
bold Yale philosophy graduate, has hit rock 
bottom, securing a place as the least watched 
show among the major television networks.

First Time Out's failure is partly due to its 
mediocre supporting cast and its creativity-
deprived writers. Of course, a slot on the 
Warner Brothers Network at 9:30 on Sunday 
nights hasn't helped much either. Many have 
simply dismissed the show as a Friends or 
living Single rip-<lff.

Aside from the obvious shortcomings, First 
Time Out introduces a brave concept. Guerra 
is the first Latina-American to star in her own 
sitcom-a fact of which she's well aware. The 
Virginian-Piwt quoted Guerra as saying, "We 
hope to show a side of Latino culture you don't 
see on Cops." Guerra isn't shy about her 
crusade to propel America's Latino legacy into 
the cultural mainstream. At points during her 
show, snippets of Spanish conversation and 
'slang are sub-tided in English. Furthermore, a 
socially and racially diverse cast complements 
Guerra's minority heritage.

Sending a respectable, but flawed, 
message, the show's main problem lies not in 
how it attacks Mexican stereotypes. but the 
hypocritical paradoxes it creates while 
criticizing them. In a recent episode, Jackie 
(keeping her name in the show}, heads south 
of rhe California border to see a dentist in 
Tijuana in hopes of saving on medical fees. 
Her friend, Nathan (Craig Anton), a clueless 
Generation-X slacker, expects to see the 
Mexican dentist wearing a sombrero and 
poncho. Guerra clenches her teeth , 
denouncing stereotypes and chiding him for 
his ignorance. Then, strangely enough, the 
dentist, on bis way back from a fiesta, does 
appear in a sombrero and poncho. The writers 
sacrifice the show's message, ttying to pull in a 
forced laugh.

While Jackie attempts to fight ethnic 
stereotypes, the other characters remain 
confined within stereotypes as well. Nathan 
portrays the same mainstream vision of a 
twenty-something that rwenty-somethings are 
trying to avoid. One of Guerra's roommates, a 
dirzy blonde, is nothing more than a dirzy 
blonde. Even Jackie's boyfriend can't stop 
making lame fat jokes about her, refusing to 
sleep with her until she drops some pounds. 
By the end of an episode, you get the feeling 
that all young people are self-absorbed, 
superficial, and sex-crazed.

The writers of the show want First Ttme 
Out's audience to take for granted the 
brilliance of Jackie's Yale-educated mind. Yet, 
she has struck a wall with two dead-end jobs. 
In return for mocking her Yale past, she has 
added the how-will-we-pay-this-month's-rent 
component to the show. Yale, Guerra, the 
audience-who hasn't the show insulted?

Genuinely funny in her stand-up comedy 
days, Guerra was forced to deputize much of 
the comedy writing to the producers. Like 
Margaret Cho, the Asian-American star of AIJ-
.American Girl (whose show was cancelled by 
ABC}, Guerra must contend with the loosely 
planned and poor dramatic set up of the 
sitcom before raging against ethnic stereotypes. 
Nobody cares about learning lessons from a 
flop. With the downfall of other cultural 
vehicles like Ail-American GirL and The Jeff 
Foxworthy Show (representing the Southern 
belt}, Jackie Guerra's show has yet another 
stereotype to fight.
