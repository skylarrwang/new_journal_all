The last skill-and according Goleman the most important-is impulse control which is drilled into students early and often. A poster hanging in a classroom depicts a stoplight and reads: "Stop, calm down, and think before you act." The hope is that students will learn to think through their actions, rather than letting their anger move them to do something rash. Ideally, when confronted with a real-life situation, students will have already internalized the steps to a non-violent solution, and will be able to resolve the conflict peacefully.

The program has seen real results. There has been a decline in the number of 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds who report having had sexual intercourse, as well as a decrease in the number of situations in which the children report that they would fight.

Other testimonials abound: tales of parents getting along better with their children; a story about a sixth-grader who prevented her best friend's suicide by soliciting the help of a Social Development teacher; a student who is certain she would have ended up an unwed, pregnant teenager if she hadn't been taught to stand up for her rights in her Social Development class.

"I think the results are pretty close to spectacular," says Shriver. "Fighting is down, suspensions are down, safety is better, hopefulness is up. Children have a sense of the future."

Although the Social Development Program appears to be addressing the same themes as emotional intelligence, Goleman can't claim credit for its success. The program was developed by former Yale professor Roger Weissberg, in collaboration with educators, but independently of Salovey and emotional intelligence researchers. "I think it's a happy accident, frankly," Goleman says. "The fact that it was independently discovered by the program's developers gives me more faith in its intrinsic success. It suggests that there is a common core of competencies which act as a buffer or inoculation for a child facing perils like drug abuse or violence or dropping out."

Yale psychology professor Peter Salovey believes an alternate form of intelligence.

Salovey objects to this thought process. "The press on this over the past two weeks, in part encouraged by the Goleman book, implies that this is the answer to social problems-this is the answer to teenage pregnancy; this is the answer to drug use; this is the answer to drop-outs; this is the answer to unemployment; this is the answer to dying prematurely." The danger here, Salovey argues, is in blaming the victim-in saying, "If only you were smarter about your emotions, this wouldn't have happened to you." The problem with that, Salovey says, is that it takes social problems and implies that they have individual solutions. "The idea that it's going to save the world from all these social ills, I think, is the wrong level of analysis."

Of course, no one can deny that a program that teaches children to be better problem-solvers, to negotiate difficult interpersonal situations, or, as Salovey puts it, "basically to learn how to share the basketball rather than punch the other guy and take it." Goleman's book will increase public awareness about the potential effectiveness of such programs.

"I think the critical thing to recognize here is that we're doing incremental work," Shriver said. "You don't expect kids to come in as if they just mastered long division and say, 'aha, I can do it.' What you're likely to find is a lot of small steps that result in a bigger picture that says that we as communities, schools, families are working better together."

What's the next step in emotional intelligence research? For starters, earlier this year the Yale Child Study Center established CASEL, the Collaborative for the Advancement of Emotional and Social Learning, to promote courses that teach these kinds of skills to children.

Meanwhile, Peter Salovey is working on a book of his own. Says Salovey, "I was going to call it something like Emotional Competency and Emotional Literacy, but now I'm thinking of calling it Emotional Competency and Emotional Intelligence." He laughs. "Why should Dan Goleman be the only one who gets to use emotional intelligence in the title of his book?"
