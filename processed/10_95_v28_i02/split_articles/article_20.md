Health Services once a week during her 
freshman year to help her lose weight, but 
she never mentioned her bulimia. Her 
trainer never noticed the problem, despite 
the fact that Gallo's weight fluctuated 
more and more dramatically as the year 
progressed. One morning in the trainer's 
office, Gallo suddenly began to cry. When 
one of the trainers asked her what was 
wrong, she said "Nothing, I just can't do 
this." No one probed any further than 
that. "They kept saying 'Don't worry, you 
can do it,'" she explains. "What they 
thought they were doing was encouraging 
me to stick to my diet and lose the weight 
for sprints, but what they were actually 
encouraging me to do was continue 
hinging and purging." During her 
sophomore year, Gallo managed to stop 
by herself. 

T hough Yale's health service didn't 
detect Gallo's problem, Goldberg defends 
the existing medical system at Yale. He 
points to the fact that unlike some 
universities, Yale doesn't automatically 
dismiss athletes with eating disorders from 
participation in their sports, but instead 
tries to use the sport as part of a complex 
solution to the problem. The difficulty, he 
says, lies in pulling athletes at risk for 
eating disorders into the system. This 
year, Goldberg has already scheduled 
meetings with coaches and captains to 
plan ways to make the services more 
accessible to athletes with eating 
problems. A presentation Brownell gave to 
coaches about the causes, symptoms, and 
treatment of eating disorders convinced 
Young and Keefe to set up talks next week 
for their teams. Simpson has noticed a 
drastic improvement. Last year, she says, a 
single name in an athletics department 
brochure was the only resource of which 
0CTOBÂ£R 13, 1995 
she was aware. 

When Gallo quit the crew team, she 
suggested that she talk to the freshwomen 
trying out to be coxswains about eating 
disorders. Black fully supported her efforts 
to prevent her experience from recurring. 
One freshwoman who had recovered from 
an eating disorder in the past decided not 
to continue tryouts after Gallo's talk. 

Goldberg has decided that Gallo's 
approach works. With Tom Beckett, 
Director of Athletics, he is planning a peer 
counseling program in which athletes will 
be trained to counsel other athletes about 
the resources available to them at Yale. 
The students themselves, Goldberg 
believes, will be more successful at 
bringing vulnerable athletes into the 
system. He expects the program to be 
running by the spring, and eventually, he 
wants the captain of every sport to be 
trained extensively to deal with the issue. 

D
alrymple, Gallo, and Fortunato 
will all graduate in May. With or 
without Yale's help, they have 
each survived moments in the pool, on 
the river, or on the field, when they were 
seized by an awareness of the destructive 
power sometimes wielded by the sport 
they loved. The freshwomen who will 
replace them next year will have far more 
resources at their disposal, if they face 
eating disorders. But the influences of 
University Health Services, coaches, even 
other teammates cannot alter the essential 
loneliness of eating disorders. And, says 
Gallo, an ideal coxswain still weighs under 
100 pounds.
