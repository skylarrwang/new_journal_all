y is it," wondered Peter Salovey, "that some 
of the smartest people we know are so 
stupid?" At the time, Salovey, Yale professor 
of psychology, was painting his house with 
the help of his friend John Mayer, a fellow psychologist with 
training in the field of intelligence. 

In the ensuing conversation, the ~o men noted that academia 
seemed to be a haven for bright bvt socially unskilled people. They 
challenged each other to define "charisma." Why is it, they asked 
themselves, that so many academics seem to have so little of it? 

By the same token, they acknowledged, there are other people 
who seem especially skilled at purring people at ease-those to 
whom one reveals one's deepest secrets. Why are some people so 
naturally easy to talk to that they make social interactions seem 
effortless? 

a leader in the study of emotions, Salovey proposed that a 
arge part of charisma might involve a set of emotion-related 
kills: being able ro understand and express one's own 
emotions, being able to read nonverbal cues in others, being able to 
calm people down or cheer them up and •tsing emotions to gain 
new perspectives on solving problems or to enhance one's creativity. 

Referring to his own area of expertise, Mayer offered his 
opinion: such a set of skills could constitute a certain kind of 
intelligence that couldn't be measured by an IQ rest. 

Their conversation resulted in the 1990 publication of a paper 
entitled "Emotional Intelligence," in which the two authors 
proposed a framework for thinking about emotion-related skills as 
a form of intelligence. 

When first published, the paper attracted little attention 
outside of the scientific community. But with the recent release of 
Emotional lnulligmu by Daniel Goleman, a N~w York Tim~s 
science writer, emotional intelligence has landed at the center of a 
storm of controversy about what it means to be smart. Already, the 
book is number five on the bestseller list. The cover of the October 2 
issue of Tim~ magazine proclaims that "emotional intelligence may 
be the best predictor of success in life." Even President Clinton is 
talking about it. During a recent campaign, Clinton's motorcade 
made an unscheduled visit to the Tattered Cover bookstore in 
Jay Dixit 
Denver. "I'll tell you what's a great book," he told reporters, "this 
Emotionallnt~//igmu. It's a very interesting book. I love it. Hillary 
gave it to me." 

According to Goleman's book, "Emotional intelligence is 
basically a different way of being smart." It involves the set of skills 
that Salovey and Mayer proposed, along with some additio!ls. 
What's more, Goleman claims that emotional intelligence skiUs are 
much better predictors of a person's future success than the skills 
traditionally measured by IQ. 

This, of course, is not a new idea. That's why we have words 
like "nerd" and "geek" to describe people who may have book 
smarts, but are socially inept. Conversely, we call people 
"charismatic," "popular," or "charming,'' if we find that they have 
the set of people skills we deem important. 

But somehow that conventional wisdom has gone ignored in 
modern psychological circles. Peter Salovey thinks that we owe our 
neglect of emotions to the fact that "the last 2,000 years of Western 
thought have always pitted passion against reason." Emotions have 
traditionally been thought of as disruptions that should be 
minimized and regulated because they disturb the thought process. 

Whatever the reason, emotions are seldom mentioned in 
connection with intelligence. Indeed, traditional intelligence 
researchers continue to be openly hostile to the idea that emotions 
constitute a part of intelligence. As a result, the idea that we possess 
an emotional intelligence is nothing shon of revolutionary. 

Part of the reason for the controversy lies in the media's 
portrayal of emotional intelligence. The cover of Tim~, for 
instance, tantalizes readers with the question, "What's Your EQ?" 
But according to Salovey, "There is no EQ. There's no EQ test. We 
would never argue that there is one, or that a single EQ is even a 
measurable construct." The test printed in Tim~ under the heading 
"One Way to Test Your EQ" is actually a test of optimism. 

Emotional lnttlligmc~ deliberately places itself in the midst of 
an already ·heated debate over intelligence. Goleman goes so far as 
to quote Richai-d Hernstein and Charles Murray, whose book Th~ 
B~/1 Curv~ corroborates Goleman's thesis, that "the link berween 
test scores and ... achievements is dwarfed by the totality of other 
characteristics." 

So why this talk about feelings all of a sudden? Goleman writes
THE NEW jOURNAL 

that he had a very good reason for bringing this up when he did. 
All around us, he writes, in our cities, in our communities, in our 
schools and on our streets, things are getring worse. In his preface, 
Goleman presents a compendium of some of the more disturbing 
stories in the newspaper that week. A nine-year-old's temper 
tantrum that turns into a rampage, a shoving match in a crowd that 
ends in a shooting, statistics about parents murdering their 
children, a neo-Nazi on trial for burning five women to death. 

What's the common thread here? "The news," Goleman writes, 
"simply reflects back to us on a larger scale a creeping sense of 
emotions out of control in our own lives and in the people around 
us. " 

Many of these problems, Goleman argues, have their root cause 
in the "surging rage and despair"· that is the result of poor 
management of our emotional lives. "This book," he writes, "is a 
guide to making sense of the senselessness." 

Goleman's definition of emotional intelligence lends itself to 
theories of behavior modification. Unlike the IQ test, which 
attempts to rate the purely genetic component of intelligence, 
emotional intelligence incorporates social influences. The solution 
is to teach it to our children in schools. 

The Social Development Program, headquartered is at 
Hillhouse High School, is taught in every New Haven public 
school at each grade level from kindergarten through senior high. 
Instituted in 1988, the program aims to combat the growing 
problems of violence and HIV. 

Tim Shriver, former supervisor of the Social Development 
Program, claims that, alrhough the program does not use the term 
emotional intelligence, "If you look at the examples, we're really 
talking about the same thing." Point for point, the Social 
Development Program teaches the skills that Goleman advocates in 
his book. 

The first skill of emotional intelligence is the ability to identify 
and articulate one's own feelings. This is taught starting in 
kindergarten, where children learn to give "I messages"-
statements that begin with "I feel." Training in using the 
vocabulary of feelings continues in various forms through the sixth 
grade. By learning to verbalize feelings in this way, children master 
the first skill of .EQ.

In New Haven elnnmtary schools, students learn to "stop, calm 
®wn, and think before you act. " 

A second important skill is empathy. Mickey Kavanagh, one of 
the SOP's facilitators, calls this "knowing what it's like on the other 
side." Empathy is practiced in the fourth and fifth grades in games 
such as "Making Faces," in which one player receives a card with a 
"feelings word" and mimes it, charades-style. The other students 
are then challenged to read his facial expressions and body language 
to guess what feeling is being represented. The idea is that in a 
crisis situation, if each child is able to tell how the other is feeling 
and to understand the other's situation, they will be more likely to 
resolve the conflict peacefully. 

Goleman's third skill is motivation-what he calls "maintaining 
hope and optimism in the face of setback and adversity." Students 
are taught motivarion through a six-step process that includes "say 
the problem and how you feel," "set a positive goal," "think of lors 
of solutions," and finally, "go ahead and try rhe best plan." 

Children are also taught how to administer "warm fuzzies" -a sure 
way to cheer up their classmates.
