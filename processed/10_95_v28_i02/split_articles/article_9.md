**Yale's Tabloid Witness**

It was the story that stunned the nation. 
This would be the typical opening to an 
article featuring Dr. Stephen Herman, a child 
psychiatrist affiliated with the Yale Child 
Study Center. Sensational news and big 
headlines are nothing new to Dr. Herman. As 
an expert witness, he has figured in some very 
high profile court cases. In 1993, Herman was 
a prominent witness in the Woody Allen-Mia 
Farrow custody battle. Mia Farrow's legal team 
called in Herman to dispute the Yale-New 
Haven Hospital report that cleared Woody 
Allen of allegations of sexual abuse. In 1994, 
Herman was the expert witness for the defense 
of Eric Smith, a 13-year-old who beat a four-
year-old to death in Savona, New York. In the 
highly publicized case, Herman testified that 
Smith suffered from "intermittent explosive 
disorder" and was not in control of his rage 
impulses. From a 20/20 appearance to 
comment on the Spur Posse, a group of jocks 
at a California high school who competed off 
the field by seeing which one could have sex 
with the most girls, to a guest appearance on 
CNN's Sonya Liv~!, Herman's opinions on a 
wide range of cases have appeared regularly in 
the check-out aisle. Most recently he was 
reported to be the expert witness in the 
upcoming McCaulay Culkin custody battle, 
but he will not appear due to what he called 
"technical legal reasons."

What makes Herman's views on these 
issues in such demand? Herman was hard

pressed to explain the media's attraction to 
him. He said, "I don't know quite why that 
happens. It's nothing that I necessarily seek 
out. "

At first Dr. Herman was hesitant about 
talking to a Yale publication, "I have no 
interest in getting publicity about celebrities 
or ever talking about them," he said. But 
Herman theorized that his early press 
appearances in high profile cases led the media 
to him more often. Dr. Herman was a little 
taken aback at the suggestion that he is a 
national expert and replied, "Urn ... I don't 
know what to say to that." National expert or 
not, the fact remains that one of the most 
widely quoted child psychiatrists in tabloid 
news is at Yale.

Well sort of. While affiliated with. Yale, 
Dr. Herman's office is 
in Wilton, 
Connecticut. Officially, Herman is an 
associate clinical professor at the Yale Child 
Srudy Center. But, he does not teach at Yale 
and says, "Lately, I haven't been too active." 
Inquiries at the Child Study Center led to 
confusion there. One person at the center 
said, "I haven't heard of him." Another 
explained that an associate clinical professor is 
an unpaid appointment, but when asked 
exactly what Dr. Herman has done with the 
center or what he did to get an appointment, 
she replied, "I can't answer that question."

Though Dr. Herman downplays his 
academic affiliation with Yale, the media 
usually names him "a Yale University 
psychiatrist." Even Herman points out that 
not all experts carry the same weight in court. 
He explains, "It's up to judges to decide 
whether experts are equally qualified or not. 
Because the person is qualified as an expert to 
testify doesn't mean the person has the same 
level of credentials or qualifications." When 
he was called in to testify for Mia Farrow, it 
was to dispute a report signed by Dr. John 
Leventhal (Hon. MA '92), a pediatrics 
professor at the Yale School of Medicine and 
director of the Yale-New Haven Child Sex 
Abuse Center. Though it would seem 
advantageous for Farrow's legal team to have 
another Yale expert, Herman doesn't see the 
connection. "I was requested by Mia Farrow's 
6 
lawyer to review the report. It had nothing to 
do with my academic affiliation."
