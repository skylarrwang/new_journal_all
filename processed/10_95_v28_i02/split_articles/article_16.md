EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The main obstacle has been pulling all the 
evidence together. Kiernan himself has 
become almost a hero in this effort. He 
tells the story of the rescue of 1 ,000 pages 
of archives from a rural prison. Listening to 
the story gives the outsider an inkling of 
the disarray that characterizes the records 
of the Khmer Rouge period. One begins to 
understand for the first time the truly 
ground-breaking work of the CGP. 


In 1980, while doing independent 
research, Kiernan photocopied the archives 
of the prison-one of the most complete 
sets of prison archives seen at that point-
and deposited the copies in a museum in 
Cambodia. In the ensuing years, the 
originals were lost; when local residents 
began asking for the copies, the museum 
could not locate them. Kiernan went to 
Cambodia in August of this year and found 
them himself, "lying in a cupboard" in the 
archive room. These documents are being 
scanned into the program's database. 


The mandate established by the 
Cambodian Genocide Justice Act was 
slated for two years of work; the grant will 
end in 1997, at which point Kiernan hopes 
the CGP will have built a strong enough 
foundation to keep the momentum going. 
The database will be loaded onto the 
network, and the operations of the center 
will be turned over to Cambodian 
management. Etcheson is optimistic that 
all the publicity afforded to the project may 
bring in more funding and doubts that the 
work will suffer in any way after the two~ 
year deadline. 


The Khmer Rouge leaders, while at 
large, are not at rest. Since being 
overthrown in 1979, the Khmer Rouge has 
been waging war against Cambodia. For 
the moment, they are on the defensive, 
pushed back into northwest Thailand. 
While the Khmer Rouge constantly pelts 
the bruised body of Cambodia with threats 
of future injury, the Cambodians who work 
on this project must deal with the 
knowledge that future reprisals are possible. 
Kiernan admits this is "very much on my 
mind," but says that the Cambodians 
working on the project do not voice such 
concerns aloud. 


T here can be lirtle concern, it seems, 
among the projects volunteers for such 
hidden, hypothetical dangers when faced 
daily with the written record of the 
unimaginable horrors that have already 
transpired, for which the Khmer Rouge has 
yet to be brought to justice.
