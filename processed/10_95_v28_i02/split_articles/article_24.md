"How are you finding Yale?" 
"It has set in already-" I said, jaw set. 
"Yale has?" 
"No, no, horrible despair has-set in." 
"That is-maybe a bit premature, three days into the year." 
"Of course. You are right." 
Scot would have been highly suspicious of my enjoying the 
company of the rabbinate, but Art would have been glad I was not 
ruining my chances of political influence so early in the year. The Jew 
who alienates the power structure before Yom Kippur will fast alone and 
have much for which to atone, but I did not foresee any terrible trouble. 


Days later, I was eating blintzes made without milk or honey in the 
Kosher Kitchen. "Are you going home for the holidays?" asked someone 
at my right. 
"No," I said. "Spring break falls well before Passover this year." 
"What-" 
"It's probably just as well that I'm staying here-my grandmother 
had just formed the Commemorative Apple Salad into blocks the week 
before I came up here." Nan believes in advance preparation. Then I 
realized she was not referring to Passover, but the upcoming High 
Holidays. "No. My stepdad would laugh, I think, if I came home for the 
New Year." My earliest memory of Rosh Hashanah is of Scot's standing 
in the kitchen, making fake shofar noises so I might not regret missing 
the blowing of the ram's hom at services. 
"Your family isn't observant, then?" 
"Popart, my grandfather, is a big. tremendous deal on the Jewish 
political scene, back home. 'Moses! Golda! Art!' they say. But no, my 
stepdad and I aren't observant, except for the Seder." 
"Is that hard on you? Why all this enthusiasm, then?" 
"Don't say that!" 
"Is enthusiasm bad?" she asked. 
"The enthusiastic are all in temple youth organizations-wait, 
pardon me, nothing personal-" 
"Oh, no, I never did youth group. Never my thing." 
"Most of them wear sleeveless clothes. Scary types," I said. 
"I guess they aren't very observant-" 
"It's not the observance that worries me! Taste. Bad taste." 
"Better than at my shuJ-at home, the youth groups practically 
cover their hair. I think my mother was afraid that if I went to Israel, I 
would come back like that-very pious, very modest." 
"This was exactly what was worrying my stepdad-" 
"You were covering your hair?" 
"No, no, he warned me not to get sucked in, into this dairy lunch

with it," 
I said. 
"Too 
late, 
then. 
You've 
been 
assimilated, I guess." 
She grinned. 
"So to speak, yes." 
"And we are such a happy, cheerful 
band," she said, with tongue in cheek. "Maybe your High Holidays will 
actually be better up here, despite-" 
"Because of-" 
"Your being away from your family." 


The morning of Rosh Hashanah was swarming with prayer 
bawls of every stripe. There were Jews in the entryway, Jews in 
the restroom, Jews standing outside. After going to services, I 
called home. Scot answered. 
"L'shanah-'' he began. "I'm trying to think of the Hebrew for 
'Happy New Year'-" 
"L'shanah haba'ah-no, that's for Passover." 
"L'shanah tovah! Good year!" 
"Did we even remember to say, 'Next year, in Jerusalem!' last 
Passover?" 
"I don't know, Little Ms. Rabbi-don't take this great Jewish 
schol.ar's word for it, though." 
"Next year, in New Haven, then-may all, especially me, be free!" 
"Once I get that bursar bill, we'll see how 'free' you are. Those 
blintzes are on the meal plan, you're sure?" 
"This is Yale, Scot! Of course they a.re." 
"Where is this thing, the diaspora?" he teased, with his best Israeli 
inflection. "I see no dispersion there, in the Kingdom of the Kosher 
Lunch, at the Shrine of Tht Ntw York Ttmts." I had wandered out of 
the South Texas desen into someplace more temperate, where blintzes 
grew on bushes, and where there were no zealots to bother me as I ate 
them.
