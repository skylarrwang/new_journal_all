The Long Wharf Theatre and the Elm Shakespeare program sponsor Shakespeare's World, a program is designed to 
acquaint New Haven high school with classic dramatic works. 
numerous corporate sponsors, he is nevertheless dismayed and 
confused at our leaders' recent maneuvers on Capitol Hill. 
Leaning forward in his black leather office chair, raising his 
hands as if to get our politicians' attention, Rosenblum questions 
the rationale behind the cutbacks; .he wonders why, at a time 
when his established and patently successful theater company 
flourishes-
in spite of the double threat of existing in a 
community still limping from years of recession and successive 
years of a steadily weakening national economy-the National 
Endowment for the Arts must reduce its funding to the Theater 
from a high point of nearly $200,000 a year to only $60,000 for 
fiscal year 1996-97. He cannot understand why the government 
would put clearly successful programs-like those at the Long 
Wharf-in jeopardy. Like administrators and artists nationwide, 
he worries how these cuts will affect his organization, and, 
almost 'resignedly leaning back in his chair, wonders if our 
national arts community can survive the budget crunch. 


But Rosenblum and his organization are not the only ones 
who will be affected by NEA cutbacks: from Yale's Repertory 
Theater and Art Gallery to the Audubon Court arts district, New 
Haven arts organizations are mobilizing to fight the cuts. On rhe 
shady rust-red Audubon street, where artists and students from 
the greater New Haven area photograph, paint, dance, rune 
instruments, and recite, concern about the future escalates as the 
national climate becomes increasingly averse coward rhe arts. 
Although organizations in this area do not receive direct funds 
from the NEA, arts organizers claim that the reduction and 
possible demise of rhe national agency will effectively eliminate 
leadership in the arts community. Cutbacks will substantially 
curtail the Connecticut Commission on the Arts' ability to give 
0cro&ER 13, 1995 
financial support to New Haven arts organizations. "The 
elimination of those funds will add up to a real reduction in the 
livelihood of arrs organizations. Everyone will feel an impact," 
predicts Bitsie Clark, publicist for the Arrs Council of Greater 
New Haven. 


The Arts Council of Greater New Haven has, for many years, 
given voice and unity to the Audubon arts neighborhood, 
promoting sponsorship and patronage of rhe arts, establishing 
cross-organizational and grassroots programs, and publishing a 
monthly newsletter which outlines the calendar of artistic events 
in the area. Situated at the heart of Audubon Court, the council 
sits amid the Neighborhood Music School, the Creative Arts 
Workshop, Artspace, the Educational Center fo r the Arts, 
Connecticut Public Radio and Television, the Little Theater, and 
the office of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra. Keeping close 
tabs on the effects the proposed cuts in federal funding are 
beginning to have on the community, the Arrs Council itself is 
considering applying for increased Connecticut Tourism Council 
funding to preempt potential financial difficulties. Clark 
elaborates: "You see, the NEA wields an influence far beyond the 
financial." She explains that one of the most important functions 
of the agency is to place a stamp of excellence upon artists and 
arts organizations, so that private donors know who deserves 
support, developing organizations know who to look to for 
leadership, and the artists themselves may be rewarded for their 
excellence by their government. 


In New H aven, the NEA primarily works to develop its 
expansion arts programs. "These experimental initiatives have 
traditionally abounded in the city. They begin with NEA 'seed 
money' and, if they succeed, branch out on their own," Clark
