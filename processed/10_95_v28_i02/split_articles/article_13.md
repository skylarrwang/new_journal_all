Cuts in federal funding for the arts bring a national debate to New Haven. Local arts 
organizations such as the Long Wharf Theater brace themselves for the future. 
Art for Art's Sake? 
t doesn't look like much: just another converted warehouse 
down at the wharf made inconspicuous and indistinct by 
grey industrial paint, large shipping crates, imposing 
advertisements for paper products and bagels and fish. You 
could drive right by and miss it altogether. But what looks like 
very little from the expansive parking lot out front is, in fact, a 
theater of national repute and a leader in the New Haven arts 
community. 
For within its humble trappings, the Long Wharf Theater has 
represented regional professional drama since its inception in 
1964. The theater touts such achievements as Tony Awards, 
Pulitzer Prizes, and productions picked up by Broadway and 
PBS. The Long Wharf maintains a multi-million dollar 
operating budget, employing over 200 theater professionals and 
producing ten plays annually. 
In addition, the Long Wharf Theater has developed outreach 
programs to involve the New Haven community in the arts. In 
recent years, the company has introduced over 2,000 New Haven 
students to live theater each season through Shakespeare's World, 
a program that runs workshops relating the plays to issues in 
students' lives. The company also offers lower-priced 
performance previews and presents audiences with the 
opportunity ro enjoy free open discussions with scholars and 
actors. 
Much of the Long Wharf Theater's success has been made 
possible by the National Endowment for the Arts. Established in 
1965 as a federal agency dedicated to developing and preserving 
the nation's creative talent, the NEA distributes millions of 
dollars annually to arts programs across the nation. Last year, 
with a budget under $200 million, the NEA supported 4,000 
12 
artistic endeavors nationwide, from folk art festivals in South 
Dakota, to chamber music groups in Florida, to the Dance 
Theater of Harlem. The NEA's primary beneficiaries represent 
the two extremes of the art spectrum: it promotes and sustains 
"cream of the crop" institutions like the Metropolitan Museum 
of Modern Art and the Yale Repertory Theater, and makes the 
arts accessible to all Americans through experimental education 
and community outreach programs. 
B 
ut heavy cutbacks in the National Endowment for the 
Arts' budget have forced the federal organization to slash 
its funding almost unilaterally. Press releases from arts 
advocacy groups report that the organization's budget for the 
fiscal year 1996-97 has been approved at $99.5 million, a 
reduction .of nearly $70 million from the fiscal year of 1995-96. 
The Long Wharf will be hit next year with a dramatic 50 percent 
decrease of its federal backing. Mter next year, the future of NEA 
funding looks even more bleak: the House of Representatives has 
advocated the outright elimination of the agency by the year 
2000. 
Around the Wharf, people are fiercely contesting the House 
position. The Long Wharf has received funding from the federal 
agency for every one of its 30 years, and never before has Edgar 
Rosenblum, executive director of the Long Wharf, feared for the 
agency's future. "It has become trendy to attack the arts," says 
Rosenblum. "But there is no reason to eliminate the NEA. The 
arts community depends on it for support, leadership, and 
recognition." Although his organization no longer depends on 
NEA funding as its lifeblood, having long ago established an 
endowment, attracted a stable audience base, and recruited
