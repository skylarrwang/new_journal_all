S 
tanding in front of a filing cabinet in his office on the third 
floor of Hall of Graduate Studies, Ben Kiernan holds out a 
piece of paper. The rows and columns that criss-cross the 
page are filled, in the scrolling letters of the Khmer 
alphabet, with che names of Cambodians. Only the scrawled note 
written across the right side of the page undermines the orderliness 
of the record, "Kill them all," it says. The nore is signed by Deuch, 
the direcror of rhe Khmer Rouge extermination center at Tuol 
Sleng. 

As he runs his finger down a lefr-hand column, reading off rhe 
ages of the Cambodians on the lise-nine, nine, ten and so on-
one gets the feeling that this document is a kind of prize for 
Kiernan, Yale associate professor of history and the director of the 
Cambodian Genocide Program. The small smile he has on his face 
as he points out Deuch's signature is a wry one, signaling the lcind 
of cautious delight that surfaces when you realize that your enemy 
has jusr made a crucial mistake. 

This document, Kiernan says, is by no means an isolated 
record, a stray scrap left carelessly behind in 1979 by the Khmer 
Rouge recreating from Cam.bodia after four years of government 
conrrol. Thousands of such documents, chronicling rhe mass 
annihilation that accompanied Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime, exist 
in rhe basements of former prisons, in museums, and in private 
archives such as Kiernan's. Now, an arrempt is being made ro bring 
all of these documents together, to build a case-made stronger 
wirh each new record uncovered-against leaders of the Khmer 
Rouge on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against 
humaniry. 

The endeavor, the Cambodian Genocide Program, was brought 
to life in May of 1994 with a bill introduced by Senator Chuck 
Robb (D-VA). The ensuing legislation, the Cambodian Genocide

Justice Act,· established a State Deparrment Office of Cambodian 
Genocide Investigations ro collect informacion and to establish a 
tribunal through which to try the Khmer Rouge. 

· The State Oeparrment, in turn, contracted Yale to carry out the 
bulk of this wo.rk. Yale's Cambodian Genocide Program (CGP), 
headed by Kiernan, is co-sponsored by organizatio'ns with the 
imposing titles, and no less imposing missions, of the Center for 
International and Area Studies ar Yale and the Schell Center for 
International Human Rights at Yale Law School. 

The Genocide program here collects and archives documents 
and photographs to use as evidence of the Khmer Rouge's 
atrocities. The program also aims to form a permanent Cambodian 
Documentation Center, determine legal means of redress for the 
crimes of the regime, and train Cambodian officials and human 
rights activists in international and criminal law. 

The program, while large in scope and ambition, has a 
relatively small physical presence on campus. Kiernan, the director, 
and Craig Etcheson (DIV '69), the manager of the CGP, are at 
once the core and the bulk of the staff here. Beyond the 
involvement of a handful of Yale student volunteers, day-to-day 
operations-the cataloging, scanning, and processing of 
documents-rake place in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, where 
Yale's CGP has set up the Cambodian Document Center. 

That the main hope for redress against the atrocities of Pol Pot 
lies in the hands of these two scholars at Yale, a foreign institution 
more than six thousand miles from Cambodia, testifies to the 
thoroughness of Pol Poe's assault on the Cambodian population 
and irs resources. Estimates of the dead are inexact-the current 
Cambodian government estimates 3.1 million; the United Nations, 
2 million; and the Genocide Program, 1.5 ro 2 million. But the 
targeted victims are clear. Khmer peasants, Muslims, Chinese,

Buddhist monks, the educated elite, and those associated with the 
former government became instant targets for the Khmer Rouge 
when it came to power in 1975. The decimation of the latter 
groups........described by Ron Slye (LAW '89), the associate director of 
the Schell Center, as "the educated, the lawyers and judges: those 
who knew the law" -
inevitably hinders the effort to bring the 
Khmer Rouge to justice and necessitates the dependence on Yale's 
program. 

Cambodia's main law school has just reopened, Kiernan 
explains, and the legal profession, "almost entirely wiped out by Pol 
Pot," is beginning the slow process of rebuilding. "In the last 15 
years there has been an attempt to revive the legal system, but a lot 
mote training needs to be done," he says. Kiernan's Genocide 
Program will play a role in shaping this justice system, in preparing 
the new generation for its first and most public of endeavors. 

The CGP held a conference in August of this year that brought 
together international lawyers and human rights activists, who 
presented the legal options for bringing the Khmer Rouge 
leadership to trial. 

The foreseeable possibilities include a Cambodian domestic 
trial on counts of mass murder, an ad hoc international tribunal 
similar to the one formed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, or 
a truth commission ro gather information and issue indictments. 

This is not the first time the world has thought to try the 
leaders of the Khmer Rouge, but it may be the most serious effort 
to date. Kiernan tells of the missed opportunities of the eighties, 
when, amazingly, the Khmer Rouge still held Cambodia's seat in 
the United Nations. At that point, he says, the Khmer Rouge could 
have been hdd accountable and brought before the World Court. 

But after the Khmer Rouge relinquished that seat in the early 
nineties, that opportunity disappeared. Kiernan speaks matter-of-
0croBER 13, 1995 
facdy, although not without hints of frustration, "The world could 
have said [the Khmer Rouge] had to answer a case on the genocide 
convention ... . Nobody did anything, despite a lot of lobbying by 
myself and others." 

In 1979, the newly formed Cambodian government established 
a tribunal to prosecute the Khmer Rouge leaders for war crimes 
against humanity and genocide. Held in absmtia, with none of the 
leaders on trial present-for who knew where they were?-the trial
