EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
As a result of recent student and faculty 
criticism, the status of Yale's Reserve Officer 
Training Corps and Naval ROTC programs is 
now under investigation. In accordance with 
contracts between the University and the 
secretaries of the Army and Navy, Yale 
grants credit for courses taken under the 
military programs, and also provides the 
military with classrooms, drill fields, offices 
and office equipment, storage space, heat, 
light, telephones, maintenance, janitors, and 
secretaries, all free of charge. 

The Student Advisory Board recently 
recommended that credit for military courses 
be denied, and that the military be charged 
for its use of Yale facilities. The Course of 
Study Committee is now reviewing the 
recommendations, and the Yale Corporation 
is planning to review the University's 
relationship with the military. 

Mephistopheles offered knowledge, power 
and material pleasures to Faust if he 
would sign away his soul. Faust developed 
some reservations about his bond, but 
he managed to ignore almost all the 
warning signs. He didn't get quite what 
he expected. 

The United States Navy approached 
me with a similar deal: Knowledge-a 
four-year scholarship to any of 52 top 
colleges; Power-
the opportunity to 
command and lead men and ships; and 
Material Pleasure-
join the Navy and see 
the world. I accepted, and the Navy has 
supplied the benefits. The price: surrender 
of my soul to four years of active duty. 

Faust could have appealed to God, but I 
have no similar recourse. 

I tried to break the bond, but the Navy 
does not give up without a fight. My 
attempts to resign from NROTC were 
stifled. I was treated like a heretic, a way-
ward sinner who would ultimately see 
the light and return to the fold. The only 
way to separate myself from NROTC 
was to flunk naval science, a seemingly 
impossible task. But I managed. I failed 
both the fall semester final and a special 
re-exam, thereby immediately making 
myself liable for a maximum of two years' 
active duty as a Navy enlisted man. 

As of April 1, 1968, I have been 
formally separated from the Navy and 
my appointment as Midshipman, USNR 
has been terminated. Although this is not 
a discharge, the Navy has decided not to 
keep me as an enlisted man and hold 
me to the two years' active duty require-
ment stipulated in my contract. 

I came to seek disengagement from the 
NROTC because I could no longer, in 
good conscience, voluntarily accept the 
responsibility of ordering subordinates to 
perform tasks that I find reprehensible, 
and because I could no longer condone the 
presence on the Yale campus of an 
organization that inculcates authoritarian 
and militaristic values in students. While 
I consider myself a conscientious objector 
to the Vietnam war, I do not consider 
going to jail a positive solution to the 
problem. I will probably surrender to a 
call to active duty, but not until I have 
exercised all legal means of protest. 

When I came to Yale, the decision to 
join NROTC seemed logical. I graduated 
from Punahou, one of nine private, non-
military schools in the country that re-
quire Junior ROTC. In my senior year I 
won the outstanding cadet award and 
placed first in the state NROTC college 
aptitude test. I was like a lot of other 
relatively immature boys who are over-
whelmed by a $4000 annual education bill 
and want to make it easier on Dad; an 
NROTC scholarship seemed the perfect 
way to get both a commission in the Navy 
and a free college education. 

I had never questioned the purpose, 
ideology or even educational policy of the 
military; and there was no one to point 
out the dangers. Junior ROTC was like a 
game that everybody had to play, 
complete with uniforms and toy guns. 

I did not realize that a liberal arts edu-
cation and a military education would be 
incompatible. The former encourages the 
student to question and criticize in his 
search for the truth, while the latter 
preaches a fixed truth and discourages 
innovation. The two disciplines are 
mutually exclusive, producing intellectual 
schizophrenia. 

William Yuen, a senior in Yale College, 
is majoring in history. 

I first began to question the implica-
tions of my involvement in NROTC last 
year. During my first two years here, even 
my closest friends described me as a 
militant fascist. But the absurdity and 
immorality of our military involvement 
in Vietnam and its adverse effects on 
domestic policy made me reconsider my 
commitment to the Navy. After spending 
half of last summer playing world 
policeman on ships of the US Sixth Fleet, 
I was convinced that the authoritarian 
and irrational military mind is a distinct 
threat to freedom of thought and action 
in America rather than the guardian of our 
liberties and defender of the free world. 

The military man tends to see all issues 
in terms of harsh opposites. People, 
nations and causes are seen as either good 
or bad, friendly or unfriendly, Free or 
Communist; the military concept of reality 
is the only concept of reality. The moral 
code is based on discipline in defense of 
lofty goals; freedom, individual liberty, 
private property, law and order. But to 
defend freedom in the abstract, the 
military man must give up most of his 
personal freedom, for the maintenance of 
order always outweighs any concern 
for the individual. To sustain the morale 
that enables the US to maintain a per-
petual state of military readiness through-
out the world, the military man must 
convince both himself and the rest of the 
country that our way of life is constantly 
menaced. Naval Leadership, a book 
used in Naval Science 402 at Yale, 
articulates this divine mission: 

To the people of the United States 
fall the moral duties of supporting 
freedom and the men throughout the 
world who are trying to gain it or 
regain it for themselves and their 
people. This support will take many 
forms, all involving a certain amount 
of sacrifice. All of these will divert 
energy and money from the increase of 
the American standard of living. The 
stabilization of the standard of living 
may be compensation in itself because 
it has been demonstrated by history 
that civilizations usually begin to 
decay when the way of life of the 
people becomes too soft; that is, when 
the standard of living becomes too 
high. 

The American people ... must feel 
a debt of gratitude to God for pro-
viding the great natural resources 
which have contributed to the over-
whelming power and force that can 
be mustered in support of right-
eousness and freedom. America has 
no choice but to become protector of 
the right in the world. 

The NROTC freshman is presented 
with a quasi-intellectual background for 
the military ethic as he studies naval 
history. Man's progress is revealed as a 
continuous development of better tech-
niques and weapons of destruction. 

Naval history is the continuous struggle for 
control of the seas. For instance, freshmen 
are taught the doctrine of sea power as 
preached by Alfred Thayer Mahan. 

Until he became a professor at the Naval 
War College in 1885, Mahan was against 
an American colonial empire, "not only 
to save the expense of the large navy that 
would be necessary to protect them, but 
also to avoid the dominance of a powerful 
military caste over the democratic 
processes of government." But as he 
studied Britain's rise to world dominance, 
illusions of grandeur and glory filled 
his bead. He decided that the United 
States possessed all the prerequisites for 
being a great empire on the English model 
except for a government that understood 
and appreciated the value of sea power, 
and he began to agitate for a strong navy 
and the acquisition of colonies. A navy 
was necessary to the colonies, and the 
colonies were needed to sustain the over-
seas navy. This circular reasoning is 
unfortunately still promoted as a valid 
scholarly basis for American naval power. 

NROTC teaches Mahan's thought to 
establish an intellectual framework for 
future study, and this is the basis of 
an NROTC education. 

What does it mean to be a midshipman? 
NROTC midshipmen are expected to 
comport themselves as officers. This 
means not only short hair and coat and 
tie, but also an unquestioning acceptance 
both of government pQlicy and of all 
regulations of the program. ''1be m ilitary 
is not a democracy," says an instructor. 

A midshipman is not limited in the 
courses he may take, but be is prohibited 
from majoring in art, pre-medicine and 
some other fields. He is not discouraged 
from participating in extracurricular 
activities, but he receives a higher aptitude 
for the service rating if he is "more 
active in NROTC than in other campus 
affairs" or if be demonstrates "insatiable 
and boundless curiosity with regard to 
naval activities and extreme pride in 
the service." 

Midshipmen are forbidden to express 
publicly any views critical of current 
national policy. I learned this after writing 
a letter to the Yale Daily News criticizing 
the NROTC program. "Naval officers," 
my commanding officer informed me in 
private, "do not picket, naval officers 
do not protest, naval officers do not sign 
petitions. Such actions do not inspire 
loyalty in the men. If officers set a .bad 
example, the men will feel it is all right for 
them to revolt." This rule is not only a 
violation of the individual's freedom of 
speech under the guise of military ex-
pediency, but an intellectual crutch as 
well. While it may be justifiable for 
an officer on active duty to be muzzled, 
should a student suffer repercussions for 
writing a paper critical of American policy 
or participating in a legitimate demonÂ· 
stration? 

The content of NROTC courses is in-
tellectually repugnant; yet Yale encourages 
the program by giving it academic credit 
even when its teaching and procedures 
fall far short of the Yale norm. After the 
freshman course in naval history and 
sophomore courses in computer theory 
and psychology taught by the Yale faculty, 
the naval science curriculum becomes 
more of a trade-school course than a 
science. Courses in naval operations, naval 
leadership, naval engineering and navi-
gation become exercises in regurgitation 
of technical data and filling out forms. 

Contrary to popular opinion, NROTC 
courses are not guts; they do require work 
and the grades are not unusually high. 
But they are unique at Yale in that they 
require a minimum of creative thinking. 

Regulation of both subject matter and 
teaching lies outside normal faculty 
controls. Although they have not earned 
Ph.D.'s, naval officers on active duty are 
named assistant, associate and full pro-
fessors by Yale. The unit's commanding 
officer is appointed chairman of the Naval 
Science Department. Content of the 
courses is determined by the Navy and 
is subject to modification only by the 
. 
individual instructor and the commandiDI


officer. The Course of Study Committee 
continues to award academic credit for 
naval science courses although it has 
no control over the content of these 
courses. 

Some of the midshipmen share my 
opposition to American military and 
foreign policy and to particular aspects 
of the NROTC program. But they justify 
its presence and their participation in the 
program by saying that Yale should be 
permitted to produce her small share of 
leaders for the military establishment. 

They share my fears about dominance of 
the mindless products of the service 
academies. But we differ in that they feel 
the only way to change the military system 
is to work within it. Anyone with the 
patience to endure the restrictions and 
frustrations and to emerge thirty-five years 
later at the pinnacle of the Naval heap 
will have made so many adjustments and 
concessions to the military system that 
he could be but a shadow of the liberal, 
critical, thinking individual he was at 
araduation. 

My own experiences on summer cruises 
have only served to convince me that 
democracy has more to fear from the 
men who man her defenses and the system 
they perpetuate than from any Viet Cong 
auerrilla fighting for his freedom. 

The USS Charles Francis Adams is 
one of sixty-plus ships that at any given 
time compose the US Sixth Fleet in the 
Mediterranean. The captain of the ship, a 
araduate of the Naval War College and 
an admirer of Yale history professor 
Gaddis Smith, consented to give his eight 
embarked midshipmen a lecture on the 
goals of the US Navy in the Mediter-
ranean. "The two purposes of the Sixth 
Fleet," he began, "are containment of 
Soviet naval power in the Med and keeping 
the peac~in that order." 

The discussion moved to Vietnam and 
I found myself confronted by a roomful 
of hawks. The captain and my fellow 
middies from Annapolis believed that if 
the US pulled out of Vietnam, that nation 
would be overrun by faceless yellow 
communist hordes. They all made 
references to the devious Oriental mind, 
the international communist goal of 
world domination and historical 
precedent--China had always been 
invading Vietnam. I tried to remind them 
that China's domination of Vietnam had 
always been tenuous and that both Viet 
Cong and North Vietnamese movements 
were nationalist as well as communist. The 
captain retorted with the Truman 
doctrine-the US should move anywhere 
to contain communism. An Academy 
stalwart, who had previously informed me 
that Filipino stewards (present on all 
Navy ships), although they might be 
college graduates, preferred to wait on 
American officers because they could make 
more money than they might as teachers 
in the Philippines, concluded our dis-
cussion by stating that Korea was the 
perfect example of an American-supported 
stable government-police state and all. 

I knew when I was beaten, and I knew 
then that I had to get out.
