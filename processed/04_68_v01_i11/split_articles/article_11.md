Letters 
To the Editors: 
Not many film critics have had the guts 
to proclaim Bikini Beach an important 
cinematic event, but I think your Mopsy 
Strange Kennedy has done a disservice to 
her profession in her otherwise com-
mendable review by writing off this rich 
and vital low mimetic comedy as mere 
unconventional tragedy. 

Bikini Beach, Part One of the Annette 
Funicello trilogy presented by the Yale 
Record, is filled with the great forces that 
qualify it, I believe, as one of the denser 
works to come out of Hollywood and, even 
more important. as worthy of the critic's 
careful examination. 

Northrop Frye, the distinguished 
literary scholar, has stated in his Anatomy 
of Criticism that "in contemporary 
movies the triumph of youth is sore-
lentless that the moviemakers find some 
difficulty in getting anyone over the age of 
seventeen into their audiences." 

Alas, what Mr. Frye tells us is often 
true, and thus many of America's best 
artistic movies have escaped the mean-
ingful examination of scholars, who are 
almost always in their twenties at least! 
1t is easy to say, for instance, that Bikini 
Beach represents an archetypal triumph of 
youth, but such a precept tends to exclude 
the film's other major victory. I am 
referring, of course, to the victory of 
the California-Surfer mode of rock-and-
roll over the perverted and effete Liver-
pudlian mode, a triumph brilliantly and 
subtly executed. 

First, though, let us examine the ques-
tion of the mythic world of youth, 
established at the film's outset by the 
statement of Frankie (Avalon), cited by 
Mrs. Kennedy, that "all forever is right 
now." 

. 
Tomorrow, he confidently declares 
later, is only "the day after today," and 
thus the film defines immediately the 
world occupied by Annette, Frankie and 
their friends. Surely the contemporary 
distillation of the pastoral motif, tra-
ditionally the vehicle for romantic comedy, 
is to be found in the eternally sunny 
beaches of southern California. The 
radical metaphor which informs this 
world is the bikini. From the opening 
scenes of the film, which depict the boys 
and girls traveling in their large truck 
to the shores of Malibu or thereabouts, the 
mood of festive gaiety, of eternity, is 
firmly established. 

This idyllic mood is made all the more 
significant by the forces which oppose it, 
represented by Keenan Wynn, publisher of 
the Bikini Bugle and owner of the local 
old folks' home. Not surprisingly, this 
villain seeks to oust the youthful surfers 
from the beaches so that he may extend 
his old folks' home down the shoreline. We 
thus have the perfect example of con-
flicting forces, of the world of mutability 
and age encroaching on the world of 
eternal youth. 

The film's conclusion, however, is not 
merely the victory of one force over 
another. Instead, the movie is a lesson in 
inclusiveness, for the ending provides the 
coming together of youth and age in a 
scene which features both the teenagers, 
Annette and Frankie included, and the 
senior citizens themselves, all dancing 
frantically to the strains of Little Stevie 
Wonder, who can certainly be compared to 
Hymen in As You Like It, as he invites 
all members of the audience, the young 
and young at heart, to join in the 
celebration. 

At the risk of examiniilg Bikini Beach 
as a mere anthropological artifact, and in 
turn violating the principles of analytic 
criticism, it is necessary to pursue in 
a discussion of this movie what I earlier 
referred to as the conflict of forces in 
rock-and-roll "music." 

The movie was made a few years ago, 
so it is not surprising that the archenemy of 
Frankie is none other than "The Potato 
Bug," whose long hair and decidedly 
British accent do nothing but suggest the 
Beatles. The Potato Bug is also a rival for 
Annette's affections, such as they are. 
His singing (filled with the flavor of the 
Early Beatles, with its "ooooooohh, 
yeh, yeh" quality) entices all the female 
creatures of the Bikini World. 

Frankie, of course, ultimately triumphs 
and drives the Potato Bug back to the 
shores of England. But here lies the great 
irony behind Bikini Beach, for viewers 
know that the ethos of Surfer-California

style rock-and-roll, which finds its ob-
jective correlative in Frankie Avalon, was 
doomed to fail, despite the powerful 
statement of films like this one. 

The position of this movie, as an 
assertion of one style of life, with its comic 
and rhythmic modes, is poetically beau-
tiful and convincing, but historically 
inaccurate and misguided. This short-
coming does not detract from-in fact it 
adds to--Bikini Beach's vitality and luster 
because we are reminded, outside the 
medium itself, that nothing in this world 
is truly imperishable. This movie, with 
Frankie and Annette representing the 
ultimate paradoxical personae, is certainly 
one of the great cinematic triumphs of 
our time.
