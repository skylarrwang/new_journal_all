Tentative plans by the architectural firm of E. L. Barnes call for 
16 skylights. The lawn, only 34 feet wide, will cover less 
than one-third the present area.

One alternative to the projected plans is a wholly underground 
library without skylights. Another alternative, shown here, 
illuminates both floor levels with a light well system similar to 
that used in the Art and Architecture Building. 

Indeed, immediately north of the 
Beinecke Library and a scant few hundred 
feet from the proposed construction, the 
Yale Law School's International Law 
Library is an example of a successful 
underground facility that boasts no system 
of natural lighting. Tastefully lit by 
artificial means, and with only average 
ceiling heights, the library has produced 
no complaints of claustrophobia. On the 
contrary, faculty members and law 
students have commended it for creating 
an atmosphere free of distraction and 
conducive to extended periods of serious 
research and study. 

Elsewhere similar underground libr"aries 
have won high praise. The Johns H opkins 
University built its required spaces wholly 
underground. No massive skylight system 
mars the sweep of its lawns and the 
setting of its building. The underground 
reading areas have won accolades from 
both students and faculty, according 
to Robin Winks, a Johns Hopkins Ph.D. 
and professor of history at Yale. Likewise, 
Harvard's Fine Arts Library, including 
faculty-student carrels, is located beneath 
the Fogg Museum, without access to 
daylight. At least one Yale art history 
professor, who has used it frequently for 
research and writing, has expressed his 
enthusiastic admiration for the library as 
a place for concentrated work. 

Similarly, carrels at the Duke University 
Library are without daylight, but in the 
opinion of Gaddis Smith, a Yale history 
professor who formerly taught at Duke, 
they are wholly satisfactory for study 
and research. 

Despite such precedents at both Yale 
and other universities, a skylight system is 
nevertheless part of the Sterling Library 
scheme as currently projected. The nature 
of the glass to be used (covering an area 
of 3,328 square feet) is as yet uncertain. 
Probable breakage of the low-lying 
skylights by wayward missiles has posed 
a difficult problem for the architects. 
City codes regulating skylights require 
the use of wired glass which has the 
disadvantage of being easy to break and 
a genuine nuisance to replace. The archi-
tects prefer tempered glass, as it is 
stronger (although a rock or brick can 
break it). When broken, the tempered 
glass will shatter into small gravel-like bits 
which will not cause injury to the readers 
below, unlike the shower of sharp pieces 
of wired glass. But, according to the 
architects, necessary compliance with city 
codes may result in the use of a double 
layer of glass-tempered above, wired 
below. This double layer, to be tinted a 
dark color, will effectively distort and 
reduce the overhead view of sky and 
ornamental trees originally intended for 
the benefit of claustrophobes. Frequent 
maintenance will be required to clear the 
gently sloping skylights of snow and city 
soot in order to retain this rather unnatural 
upward vista. 

The skylit Cross Campus addition 
planned for immediate construction is 
situated between the two halves of 
Berkeley College, but eventually a lecture 
hall and other underground facilities 
(presumably skylit) are planned for the 
area bordered by Calhoun College and 
W. L. Harkness Hall. Continuous sub-
surface connection will thus be provided 
between Sterling and the proposed Social 
Sciences Library, to be located across 
College Street on the site of the Eliza-
bethan Club, the Treasurer's Office and 
the Department of University Health. 
Entrance and egress will be provided by '

a series of covered stairwells or stone 
pavilions. Construction of this later 
addition will mean the removal of the 
trees in the eastern half of the Cross 
Campus. 

At the west end of the Cross Campus, 
adjoining High Street, the architects intend 
to build, in their words, "a beautiful 
European-type plaza," faced with Belgian 
block paving. The present yew hedges 
will be eliminated. The architects hope 
eventually to negotiate with the City of 
New Haven to extend the plaza across 
High Street, making it some 22,500 square 
feet in area. The.re will be two trees. 

In keeping with this "European em-
phasis," small trees, possibly lindens, will 
be planted between the skylights in the 
central area. These will be pruned to form 
a small canopied mass beginning some 
six feet above the skylights and rising a 
maximum of fifteen to twenty feet. The 
architects also feel that the projection 
of artificial light from the skylights at 
night will "enliven" the Cross Campus. 
The prospect of a Cross Campus aglow 
like a jukebox has already been labeled 
"garish" and "nightmarish" by one 
professor. The fundamental problem of 
drainage in the area, the architects admit, 
is one of their "biggest problems." And 
no solution has been reached. 

Most intimately affected by the 
projected scheme is, of course, Berkeley 
CoJiege. Several proposals under con-
sideration by the architects and Yale 
include the elimination of the Cross 
Campus gates of Berkeley or their 
alteration, upsetting the whole circulation 
pattern of the courtyards. Other pro-
posals envision a pavilion in the Master's 
garden as a public entrance to the north 
court, matched by a pavilion entrance into 
the Fellows' garden on the south. The 
architects have pressed for this solution, 
because it would eliminate the few stairs 
between the adjacent courtyards. But it 
would also sizably reduce the Master's 
garden, as would a projected library 
fire exit. 

Plans for retaining the Berkeley 
tunnel, which connects the north and 
south courts, call for making it both 
narrower and deeper. Final proposals 
await a University survey of the passage. 
Steel piles for the new library will be 
driven down just outside the Cross 
Campus walls of Berkeley. The architects 
say they may have to excavate the 
Berkeley courtyards in order to install 
the electric conduit and other services for 
the new library. 

Though the plans have yet to be pre-
sented formally to the Fellows of Berkeley 
College, the Master of Berkeley, Charles 
A. Walker, professor of engineering, 
was first shown the detailed drawings in 
mid-March, only three months before 
the beginning of construction. While 
acknowledging the Library's needs to 
expand, Walker considers the proposals 
be saw in March to alter the surface of 
the Cross Campus and the fabric of 
Berkeley "nothing short of an outrage.·· 
"Ten years from now," he says, 
"persons at Yale will wonder how such a 
thing was seriously contemplated. This is 
dearly a case of architects out of control." 

Professor Louis Martt, chairman of 
the Faculty Advisory Committee for the 
library, shares Walker's concern over 
the alteration or removal of the Berkeley 
~liege gates. "This proposal," MartZ said 
Ill March, "which was only shown to the 
"'Faculty Committee recently, is certainly a 
case where the architects will have to 
be closely watched." 

Martz's committee was appointed in 
September, 1967, more than two years 
after proposals to expand the Library were 
initially contemplated by the Library 
administration. This is the first year, 
said Martz, that there has been a full-
fledged Committee on the Library. 

Martz feels the Cross Campus plans 
should come as no surprise to the Yale 
community. His committee has been 
meeting since autumn with groups that 
wm use the new space: the Area Studies 
Committee, the Concilium on Inter-
national Affairs and the staff of the 
Historical Manuscripts Room. "None of 
us has hesitated to discuss the plans with 
his friends," said Martz. "The designs have 
achieved considerable publicity." None-
theless, there have been no public 
meetings, and Tanis has not sent copies 
of the designs to every professor in the 
University, as did Andrew Keogh, the 
librarian when Sterling was being planned. 

In fact, not more than a handful of 
persons has seen the architects' most 
recent renderings. At an April 2 meeting 
of the History Department with Tanis, for 
example, not a single drawing of the 
Cross Campus proposals was shown to 
faculty members. 

The expansion under the Cross Campus 
will provide just a fraction of the space 
needed, Martz adds. The area under 
the Cross Campus, moreover, is to be 
flexible space. Martz suggests it might even 
be used for something other than Area 
Studies when the Social Science Center 
is completed. 

"I'm actually a bit surprised to hear that 
there is any disagreement about the 
skylights," Martz said. "Our committee 
hasn't really heard much opposition"-
perhaps because almost no one in the Yale 
community has been shown the plans. 

Caught in the cross-fire of conflicting 
desires is the University Librarian, James 
Tanis, who is, ironically, a graduate of 
Berkeley College and currently a Fellow. 
While anxious to consult with interested 
parties, Tanis, unlike his predecessor, 
Keogh, feels public discussion is not 
practicable or useful. "A circularized 
questionnaire to faculty about needs and 
priorities is simply not relevant to our 
expansion," he said recently. 

Tanis's concurrence is essential to any 
of the architect's proposals. Together with 
President Brewster and Edward Barnes, 
the chief architect, he makes the crucial 
decisions, despite the existence of an 
elaborate bureaucratic filtering process. 
Reservations, for example, on the part of 
President Brewster (and one or two 
members of the Corporation) about the 
original Cross Campus design-ranks of 
prominently raised skylights covering 
the entire central area between the 
Berkeley courtyards-killed it. 

Other important details, unlikely to 
attract the President's attention. wiU be 
primarily the responsibility of the 
architects and Tanis. An example is the 
proposed connection between Linonia and 
Brothers and a projected Reserve Book 
Room on Wall Street. A connecting door 
in the north end of L&B has the double 
disadvantage of destroying the beauty and 
symmetry of that wall, with its handsome 
stone fireplace and mellow paneling, 
dominated by a portrait of Elihu Yale, and 
transforming the restful atmosphere of 
the reading room into a thoroughfare to 
the new Reserve Room. The necessity 
of connecting the two rooms at all has

been questioned, and alternative proposals 
are being considered by the Librarian. 

Designs are still in a flexible state for 
the entire library scheme, but final 
decisions on the Cross Campus spaces, 
currently scheduled for construction 
between mid-June, 1968, and September, 
1969, will be made this month and next. 
Much of the final decision-making will 
depend on detailed cost estimates. Many of 
the Library administration's original 
intentions have already been scrapped 
through lack of funds. Tentative cost for 
the entire scheme is $10 million, with 
about $2.5 million allotted for the Cross 
Campus expansion. The need for funds is 
acute, and donors have not been forth-
coming, as the opportunity for personal 
monuments is not obvious in a project that 
is essentially an expansion of an already-
existing memorial building. 

Thus the form of the Cross Campus 
Library is still subject to negotiation, 
although Barnes's office is proceeding at 
full speed toward completed construction 
documents for a skylit area. The month 
of June is, in their own words, their 
"incredible deadline." If excavation of 
the Cross Campus does not commence in 
June, 1968, it must be postponed until 
the annual summer dispersal of students 
and faculty in June, 1969. 

U costs prove too high, or if sufficient 
public objection is raised, the less ex-
pensive, safer and aesthetically preferable 
alternative of a wholly underground 
library, without skylights, may be adopted. 
Other alternatives exist. If natural light 
is insisted upon, the Library could provide 
for a light well (commonly called "moat" 
at Yale) at the base of the Cross Campus 
walls of Berkeley, between those structures 
and the present walkways. A local con-
struction engineer has pronounced the 
proposal entirely feasible, and a successful 
precedent exists at Yale's Art and 
Architecture Building. There a two-story 
light well on Chapel Street illuminates 
both the Art Library and the Graphics 
Department below. An ingenious skylight 
system at the base of the well (with no 
vulnerable flat surfaces of glass) provides 
access to natural light for yet another 
story. A similar system on the north side 
of the Art Library lights two sub-
surface levels. 

If used in the Cross Campus in lieu of 
a skylight system, a light well arrangement 
would have several important advantages. 
It would enlarge the library, permitting 
the addition of another entire level of 
reading rooms (or a mezzanine), where the 
present cumbersome skylights permit 
only one level. It would provide floor-
to-ceiling windows and the natural light 
which is demanded by some Area Studies 
scholars. Finally, placed at the periphery, 
it would alter the appearance of the 
Cross Campus only minimally. 

Approximately eight feet wide in each 
case, bordered on the surface by a low 
stone wall and suitably landscaped with 
shrubs and vines, the light wells could be 
made indistinguishable from similar 
arrangements which already exist on the 
east and west sides of Berkeley's south 
court. 

The point is this: alternatives to the 
present plan do exist, and they could be 
worked out by the current designers. It 
must now be asked whether the archi-
tects' initial commitment to skylights and 
the University's hurry to begin excavating 
this June (rather than in 1969) have not 
left these alternatives unexplored. De-
cisions permanently affecting the physical 
appearance of the center of the campus 
require not haste and "incredible dead-
lines" for architects, but thorough 
consideration. 

Among those who would most like to 
see an alternative to the proposed dis-
figurement of James Gamble Rogers's 
masterly Cross Campus design and 
Sterling Library interior is Allan Green-
berg, a local architect who received his 
Master of Architecture degree from Yale. 
Greenberg is currently working on two 
important projects which, like Sterling, 
involve additions to existing twentieth-
century buildings: Paul Cret's Superior 
Court Building and Don Barber's Supreme 
Court Building, both in Hartford. 

"A destructive and antagonistic attitude 
toward most buildings constructed in the 
first thirty or forty years of this century 
regrettably prevails among many archi-
tects today," Greenberg said recently. 
The view which equates traditional Beaux 
Arts edifices with waste and degeneracy 
was first proclaimed by the Austrian Adolf 
Loos and reinforced by the dicta of the 
influential Bauhaus group of architects 
and artists. As the critic and historian Sir 
John Summerson has pointed out, the 
Bauhaus attitude has been endorsed and 
enforced with a puritanical zeal during the 
past thirty years. An intense distaste 
for and even fear of ornament, like that 
found in Sterling (and of course in earlier 
buildings), has led to its ruthless ex-
termination. 

"This same insensitivity,'' said Green-
berg, "unfortunately prevails in the 
designs for a stairway (originally an 
escalator) in the main nave of Sterling, 
in the recently abandoned mezzanine plan 
for the Main Reading Room, in the plans 
to knock a door through the north wall 
of Linonia and Brothers, and in the 
needless destruction of the Cross 
Campus-which no sensitive architect 
could unabashedly pronounce an 'ugly, 
lifeless void.' " 

"It is particularly regrettable," he 
added, "that such a lack of accommoda-
tion toward existing buildings and spaces 
should be exhibited by the architectural 
firm which has charge of Yale's Master 
Plan." 

Greenberg's thoughts are echoed by 
Wesley E. Needham, Curator of Tibetan 
Literature in the University Library, 
Fellow of Trumbull College, and former 
architectural draftsman to architect 
James Gamble Rogers. Needham worked 
for Rogers on four important buildings 
at Ya1e, all given by John William Sterling: 
the Library, Trumbull College (originally 
Sterling Quadrangle), the Law Buildings 
and the Hall of Graduate Studies. 

"Mr. Sterling's will," Needham recalls, 
"left his estate to Yale for the erection of 
'at least one enduring, useful, and archi-
tecturally beautiful edifice, which will 
constitute a fitting memorial of my 
gratitude to and affection for my Alma 
Mater.'" As it turned out, the estate, 
over $29 million, was sufficient to endow 
professorships, fellowships and scholar-
ships, and to provide buildings for the 
Law School, Graduate School, Medical 
School, Divinity School, Sheffield 
Scientific School and Trumbull College. 
But the executors of Sterling's will con-
ceived of the Library as his principal 
memorial, and Rogers, as Sterling's per-
sonal friend, bent every effort to make 
this a reality. 

"An artistic masterpiece is a creation 
which is entire in itself," Needham says. 
"It is something to which nothing can 
be added and from which nothing can be 
subtracted without destroying the integrity 
of that first conception. It cannot be 
emphasized too much that the Library 
and the Cross Campus were carefully 
planned as an integral whole. The Cross 
Campus is important as the approach and 
setting for the Library.'' 

Needham points out that Rogers 
intended the Library to be approached 
from the present walkways at the 
margin of the Cross Campus so the 
building would be viewed obliquely 
and picturesquely, its entrance porch 
and book tower seen in an active play of 
movement against each other. The building 
was to be seen fronta1ly only as one 
came to High Street, whereupon the book 
tower would recede more modestly behind 
the handsome details of the entrance. 
The present banal scheme to move the 
walkways virtually to the center axis of the 
Cross Campus is, Needham feels, "an 
unthinking destruction of the entire 
original intention." 

Needham's remarks recall the dedi-
cation ceremonies in 1931, when John 
Anson Garver presented the building's 
symbolic key to President Angell. Garver 
reminded his audience that the Library 
was planned and erected only after 
Sterling's death. "The vision of this 
crowning memorial was never con-
templated by its donor. Under the spell 
of its strength and beauty and great spaces, 
one feels that Yale, in turn, is in some 
measure showing its appreciation and 
gratitude for these rich and enduring 
benefactions." 

Sterling died a bachelor. Today no 
member of his family remains to protest 
what he would surely have regarded as the 
desecration of the ample nave and splendid 
setting of his memorial. 

Unless someone else assumes that task, 
and asks postponement in order that 
alternatives may be considered, the very 
heart of the University will be irrevocably 
changed. Some argue that Yale cannot 
afford the time necessary to alter its 
present plans. Actually Yale cannot afford 
haste. Expenditure of millions of dollars 
is contemplated. As President Brewster 
himself has written, "The Library, of all 
the institutions of a university, is the one 
with the most pervasive effect upon the 
quality of the entire institution." If this is 
indeed true, can Yale afford makeshift, 
short-term solutions made under the 
pressure of "incredible deadlines"? 

If Cross Campus excavation and con-
struction are postponed until June, 1969, 
the architects, the Librarian and the 
President will have time in which to 
consider and reflect unhurriedly upon 
the multiple a1ternatives to the present 
designs. In this way, the appearance of the 
Cross Campus and the fabric of Sterling 
may be preserved for the future. 

Otherwise, as now planned, Yale's 
immediate gain will be 60,000 square feet 
of library space at a cost of $2.5 million. 
But the long-run cost will be great. The 
University will mutilate a treasure, a 
masterpiece of craftsmanship and in-
tegrated planning. It will lose the last opel! 
space, the last great expanse of lawn in 
the center of the campus. It will lose, 
in effect, its very core--its heart. And 
that, by anyone's standards, is a bad 
bargain.
