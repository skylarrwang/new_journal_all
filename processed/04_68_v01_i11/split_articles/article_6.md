In Which our Hero lashes out against the evils of Vase 
It's hard to tell someone who has never 
surfed what it's like. I know what it's like. 
I have known the waves, and I have par-
ticipated in the ritual. It is a ritual, 
repeated endlessly in winter and summer, 
threatened only by outsiders and school. 

Usually three or four of us go surfing 
together-"The Group"-hard-core 
surfers from the low-rent, high-motivation 
district of a small Los Angeles suburb. 
An alarm clock can scramble brains at five 
in the morning, but with effort you can 
be on the road in fifteen minutes. 

The hour trip to Ventura passes quickly 
with stories of the night before. The 
morning fog begins to clear and the sun 
rises as we ride through Ventura on the 
way to Doc's point. If the surf isn't in good 
form, we go to the Donut Doctor in 
Carpenteria and then hustle back to Doc's 
or wherever the surf is best. A couple 
more cigarettes, a few songs on the radio, 
and it's time to take the surfboards down 
to the water and head out into the 
foaming waves. Oh God, the waves. 

During the long talks surfers have on 
warm summer nights, they often discuss 
the problems of overcrowding, but gen-
erally surfers recount past surfing 
experiences and attempt to explain the 
sport's appeal to the individual, attempt to 
explain just what it is about the waves. 
This is where they get themselves in 
trouble, because the sport cannot even be 
explained by those closest to it. 

"HelJ, it's funzoo, that's all." 

"I don't know man, surfing's a feeling, 
a groove." 

Good surfing is art. It is an ephemeral 
kick for most surfers, a hobby for others, 
and for a few it is a search for wisdom, 
a religion-the watery pantheism of a 
group indifferent to all except the sea 
and its waves. To non-surfers this devotion 
may seem bewildering. But they just 
don't know what it's like. 

Look around you. College life, both 
academic and social, is all right, but after 
a while you get fed up to HERE. When 
the sun is warm, Yale becomes so much 
like a pay toilet it scares me. I have no time

College and a surfer since the age of 
nine, is the owner of more thanJorty 
issues of Surfer Magazine. 

for library tans. The same goes for after 
college. How many people can look at 
themselves and say honestly, "Wow, I'm 
happy, I'm doing exactly what I want 
with my life''? Surfing gives you, among 
other things, a good perspective on life. 
Really, most people today are losing big, 
and they never realize it. 

Surfers are romantics in a world that has 
little time for such people. They live for 
the waves, and little else matters when the 
surf is good. "There were these three 
bitchin' girls from Newport that we met 
who invited us to their apartment Saturday 
night. We knew we could get 'em. Po-
tentially a good scene. But we went to 
Pipes that day, and the surf was bonus. It ' 
stayed glassy all day with perfect shape. 
Well, we finally got out of the water at 
eight that evening. We had blown the 
whole thing with the chicks, but who's 
complaining? You can always get laid, but 
you just don't find good surf that often .. " 

The surfer travels miles for that instant 
beneath the curl, within the wave. Only 
rarely do surfers bring girls to the beach. 
The surfer, standing at an altar of fantasy 
and freedom, before the waves whose 
beauty, pleasure and challenge are suffi-
cient, needs no women. At night wine 
flows and the women are numerous, but 
they are not part of the individual 
mystique of surfer and wave. 

"Which would you rather have-a 
six-foot day at Malibu or Raquel Welch?'' 

"Well ... how many waves do I get?" 

Not many sports can ask such a 
formidable question. Perhaps part of the 
surfing mystique stems from its Spanish 
heritage. By the late 1950's, many Cali-
fornia surfers were heading south, into 
Baja California and beyond, to Mazatlan 
and La Paz. The life--one of sun and 
vino. The pace-"Lento, senor, Iento." 
They came home besandaled carrying 
botas and serapes. The bullfights in 
Tijuana added another aspect to the 
surfers' symbolic life. Their boards became 
a synthesis of cape and sword, sliding 
smoothly along the wave; their footwork 
the ballet of the torero. 

If surfing. is art and ballet, it is also 
rhythm, the movement of the surfer on the 
face of a shimmering green wall. A con-
tinuous flowing, one part falling into the 
next. The effortless dignity of an athlete 
blending with the waves' fluctuations. The 
nebulous, quixotic life of the surfer, with 
each wave different from its predecessor, 
grabs hold of you and rarely lets go. 

Phil Edwards, shaper for Hobie Surf-
boards and probably the best surfer alive, 
laughs, "Surfing sells you down the river. 
You are gently jazzed until you die." 

Once this feeling bits you, it is impossible 
to sit at a desk in Dirt City. You can never 
again view the industrial (or academic) 
empire you are a part of without regret. 
A few days or weeks out of the water and 
you snap. You look at insurance com-
pany calendars to see if the seascapes 
have any rideable waves. There is no time 
for the super-sophisticated, bored, "Oh-
gawd-Irving-where-is-it-all-going-to-
end?" attitude. Surfers are jazzed, 
"plugged into life," a life revolving com-
pletely around surfing. 

Surfers generally live in the present, 
for the present, their existence only 
slightly overlapped by the near past and 
future. But the ancient past of surfing is of 
interest, if only to demonstrate that it is not 
a new kick. When Captain Cook arrived 
in Hawaii in 1778, he was amazed by 
the bronze, nude pagans riding waves at 
Waikik1 on ten to eighteen-foot boards. 
When the Bounty arrived in Tahiti, the 
crew saw ... surfers. Oceania was 
crawling with them. 

Surfing was the central activity. The 
harvesting was forgotten if the surf came 
up. It was so much a part of their life that 
it was a part of courtship, with special 
privileges given to a man and woman 
riding the same wave together. This 
attitude toward surfing was Ka Nalu, the 
study of the wave. It was a path toward 
harmony with nature, and nature was God. 

By the turn of the century, Hawaii was 
becoming a popular tourist attraction. 
Among the tourists were California 
businessmen who saw the exotic appeal 
surfing had for the mainlanders. Boards 
were rented out and haoles, with the help 
of a beach boy ("$2.50 'n hour make-a-you 
'n wahine damgood sufurs ... hokay?''), 
could ride to the sands of Waikiki and 
write back to Wichita, etc., to teU their 
friends about it. But this surfing was 
hollow. Ka Nalu was to remain submerged 
for a decade or two longer. 

By 1912, surfing hasi come to Cali-
fornia, and the businessmen's efforts had 
turned the tourist flow from a trickJe to 
a torrent in Hawaii. The sport was on the 
rise. This increase in activity was slow 
because of the 125-pound redwood 
boards used at the time, but the nucleus of 
dedicated surfers was growing. The de-
pression came, and "There's no jobs, so 
let's go surfing." A small group of co11ege 
men lived on Southern California beaches 
with the Ka Nalu mystique maturing 
until the war came and scattered them. 

During the war, a skinny misanthrope 
with a crippled arm witnessed surfing for 
the first time. An engineering student at 
Caltech, he studied the "orbital flow of 
water particles" and watched the waves. 
He built a new surfboard-designed to 
fit the wave, light and maneuverable-and 
added a fin for stability. The war ended, 
and the surfers returned. The Bob 
Simmons Era was born. 

These surfers were not teenagers, but 
upper-class intellectuals, good-looking 
and tough, or as Dave Rochlen says, "solid 
guys who had this sport to themselves." 
On their new boards they raced ahead 
of the curl, always following Simmons. 
The cripple was their leader. ("Like the 
guy in The Fountainhead .... He was a 
man ... Neither gave nor asked quarter 
from anyone. 'Screw all you guys,' he'd 
say.") 

They went to the Islands, and came 
back to California, restless men with a 
hybrid Hawaiian-Malibu way of life. 

In the years 1945-54, surfing's Golden 
Age was reincarnated. The shacks sprung 
up at Windansea and Malibu, the men 
were lean and tough, oblivious to the 
writhing metropolis a few miles away. 
"I knew Blackie August," Rochlen 
recalls. "Lived in a cave at Palos Verdes 
Cove. He had a forty-gallon oil drum with 
a spigot for heat and light. He lived off 
nature, eating lobsters and stealing 
berries." The men were alone for the most 
part, living for the waves, enjoying life 
as the ancient Hawaiians must have. But 
things were changing. 

In 1954 a newspaper estimated there 
were 1500 surfers in the Southland. 
The number soon doubled and tripled. 
It had to. Can a Kansas summer compare 
to one in California? Simmons was no 
longer alone. The city was upon him. ne

and hoot with your guitar. Surfing was 00

longer anti-social. Jan and Dean tell it 
like it was: 

I'm gointa Surf City, 
Gonna shoot the curl. 
Gonna check out all the parties 
For a surfer girl. 

The men were out of place, Simmons most 
of all. Many went to Oahu's north shore, 
to escape the crushing hordes for a 
few more years. But wherever Simmons 
turned, he felt hemmed in: "I like to think 
that with quantity comes shit." 

In 1954 at Windansea, the storm surf 
came. Simmons drowned under one of 
the waves. It was, in a way, almost 
mer!=iful that he died before he could 
see what has happened to surfing since 
then. 

A new shack appeared at Malibu, but 
the original occupants had gone. Mickey 
Dora, a bridge between the two eras, 
expresses the thoughts of those who lived 
with Malibu in the early '50's: "Life is 
too short. Why make anything of it?" 

If the previous years were surfing's 
new Golden Age, these were its most 
colorful. "Nobody worked, our hair was 
long .... I guess we were pretty grubby.'' 
This group was younger, from 20 to 25. 
The days of style: the Dypso Calypso, 
the Quasimodo, el spontaneo, Tubesteak, 
No Pants Lance, Isaac and the Perves, the 
Fiasco Kid, Beakus and The Bag were 
their names. Malibu was loud and wild-
Holy Communion with Thunderbird 
wine and Langendorf bread, bullfights at 
Tijuana, beer and Gidget. 

Gidget, a "girl midget" as the story goes, 
1ras sent by her father to pump the surfers 
at girl-free (not girl-less) Malibu for 
material for a novel. The girl's father 
llnelled a winner, and in 1957 Gidget 
&ppeared. The bestselling novel turned 
Malibu inside out, eventually covering it 
1rith thick brown muck. Today it is the 
Mecca for all the fat tourists renting 
boards and tasting the good life-
another dying world. 

Gidget was made into a movie, and 
IUddenly everybody was surfing. The 
1r00dies rolled up and down the coast 
hipway, filled with a new breed. Malibu 
1ras a wasteland filled with mindless status 
leek:ers (average age: 16). The Doras 
IOd Tubesteaks were pushed back to make 
I'Oom for the mob. The ANNETTE 
PllNICELLO ERA had arrived (electric 
guitar fanfare-pan to 25 Hollywood 
fakes running into Lake Placid yelling 
"Surf's Up!"), with the Malibu regulars 
crying at the confusion of their lost world 
and laughing as they picked up their 
checks for riding in the surfing shots of 
Beach Blanket Bingo. For many, a bottle 
of peroxide to bleach the hair replaced the 
sun; others cruised the streets with never-
used boards on the tops of cars. "I don't 
surf'' was equivalent to "I don't wash." 

There was almost total acceptance of 
surfing among youth. The new kick. The 
adults were appalled at the long-haired 
hordes engulfing towns, raping and 
burning. Most of the trouble was caused 
by the people who had hopped off the 
set of "The Wild One" into "Gidget." 
These were the periphery, the moscas, 
many of whom have since traded their 
surfboards and wax for beads and grass to 
impress the tourists on Sunset Boulevard, 
and can be seen as the extras for The 
Trip today. 

From a few isolated rebels, surfing 
bad developed into a fad which engulfed 
American youth. Finally, inevitably 
following Hollywood, Madison Avenue 
discovered the gigantic market. Hungry 
surfers rode waves for the Pepsi Gen-
eration, sprawled themselves on Hamrn's 
Beer billboards, and rode into America's 
living rooms on shows like "Surf's Up" 
and "Wide World of Sports." 

The surfboard industry is now a multi-
million dollar business on both coasts 
with a lot of manufacturers producing up 
to six thousand boards a year. Like 
baseball and golf equipment, surfing bas 
its signature models. Models with catchy 
names trap the novice with their "in-
crowd" connotations: The Hustler, Da' 
Cat, Super Ugly, Blue Machine. Wax, 
trunks, surfboard racks, interchangeable 
tins, and even hand tins (to make paddling 
easier, of course) are available. 

Surfing is becoming "sophisticated,"' 
but for the few who really love the 'q>Ort, 
who would be out in the water even if 
the world bad never heard of surfing, all 
they need is a board, trunks, wax and 
waves. (Note that sun is not included. 
I remember more than once huddling over 
a fire with a few friends, shivering in the 
California winter with blue knees and 
numb feet.) Surfers tend to congregate 
where other people are not, and rarely 
bring suntan lotion, college or fraternity 
sweatshirts, transistor radios or the other 
essentials of a Fort Lauderdale Survival 
Kit to the beach. 

The surfboard, of course, is of prime 
importance, the surfer's one real love. 
You often see battered cars at the beach 
(nothing seems quite so incongruous as a 
Cadillac with a surfboard on top), but 
rarely will a top surfer ride a board that 
isn't in excellent condition. A ding (a dent 
or shatter in the board) causes much 
swearing, a wrecked board breaks a 
surfer's heart. I remember the summer in 
Mexico when our car spun out at 70 mph, 
destroying my new board. Upon regaining 
consciousness and crawling through the 
front window, I went directly to the 
board and bemoaned its splintered re-
mains, completely forgetting my friends' 
condition. Surfers try to be like other 
people, but they always slip up. 

With all the publicity given to surfing 
during the last few years, the California 
coast has become a fiberglass ocean. 
Everyone wants a part of the glory. But 
just as Yale is the acne-faced masturbator 
sitting alone in his room on Saturday night 
as well as the sports-car driving, frat-rat, 
ass bandit, surfing is not solely composed 
of the muscular, tanned deities of the 
waves. A friend of mine recently sold 
his board to some fourteen-year-old kid. 
The would-be surfer drove up with his 
family, bought the board, and couldn't 
even lift it onto the car. 

Often, after fighting for position on a 
wave, at the same time trying to avoid 
three or four other surfers, I dream of an 
isolated ~ach in western Australia. 
Nobody is within a hundred miles of me 
except a few friends, enjoying the waves 
by day, the beer and conversation by night. 
I wonder what it would have been like 
to surf in nineteenth-century California, 
or twentieth-century California with 
everyone gone because of the bomb. 
Everyone except me and a quiver of 
surfboards. 

Surfing is the kick. that can cure you of 
your complexes, real back-to-the-womb 
stuff. It can give "inner peace," a sort of 
wet transcendental meditation. Putting 
one's self next to nature, all is forgotten 
except the waves. It is a contest with few 
rules and many rewards. As Mickey Dora 
says, you can "live and ride nature's 
waves, without the oppressive hang-up of 
the mad insane complex that runs the 
world." 

Few except surfers know how the eyes 
strain for the first look at the ocean, and 
the endless conjecture as to what the surf. 
will be like; afterwards the satisfied re-
flection over a good ride, the warm, tired, 
healthy feeling after a day's waves and 
an anxiousness for tomorrow. It's an 
exclusive club. Phil Edwards calls non-
members the "legions of the unjazzed." 
Yale is teeming with legions of the 
unjazzed. 

This may seem over-idealized and 
maudlin to the mayonnaise-pill people of 
Yale, but this is Surfing. These are the 
feelings of surfers everywhere. This is why 
we pity people spending summers in New 
York, Chicago and St. Louis. There's not 
a hell of a lot to smile about today, but 
surfers have found something. 

These are incredible times. Thank God 
for a few free waves.
