**Title: The heart of the University: renewal or requiem?**
**Author: Robert Grant Irving**
**Page number(s): 3**

This June, as soon as alumni reunions
have disbanded, the steel forks of a power
shovel will devour the lawns of Yale's
Cross Campus. This spacious, grassy area,
bounded by Berkeley and Calhoun
Colleges and W. L. Harkness Hall, has
for nearly forty years marked the center
of the University. Now, unless voices
are beard swiftly and clearly in its defense,
the Cross Campus in its present form
will disappear forever.


Gone will be the impressive sweep of
mamcured green that provided a carpet for
band concert audiences, a playing field
for exam-weary undergraduates and an
appropriately handsome assembly point
for Yale's Commencement processions and
alumni parades. Instead the lawn will be
reduced to a patch less than one-third
the size of the present area, and this
vestigial souvenir will be surrounded by
mor~ than 3,300 square feet of glass
skyhgbts and assorted species of ground
cover and ornamental trees. Like
so many places of historic interest and
natural beauty, the Cross Campus will fall
victim to indifference, compromise and
short-term solutions. Ironically, its death
knell wiJI be rung in the name of the
building for which it has long furnished
s~ch a splendid setting: Sterling Memorial
Ltbrary. Tragica!Jy, the Library a dis-
tinguished example of Beaux ~ts
sensibilities and planning, will itself not
escape unscathed.


Dedicated amid much ceremony 37
years ago this month, on April 4, 1931,
as a personal monument to one of Yale's
most generous benefactors, the Sterling
Memorial Library has become inadequate
to its task. Today no one can or does
dispute the need for more space. Rather
the central question is the manner of
achieving this goal.


With the University unwilling to pay
the high price for properties on York
S~reet between Mory's and Broadway, the
Ltbrary has chosen two sites for
immediate construction: the large inner
light court in the stack area, and the
western half of the Cross Campus,
between the north and south courtyards
of Berkeley College.


The proposed light court addition will
not affect the general appearance of the
present Library to the casual visitor.
More obvious and intrusive will be the
insertion in the main entrance hall,
or nave, of a lighted information desk
and of a stair leading to the new under-
ground areas. The stairway will be
surrounded by a thick glass wall three
feet high, in the center of the Library nave.
The unsightly shelves of indexes which
currently choke the towering ball and
impede its normal circulation pattern are
a temporary expedient which dramatize
the library's needs. The stairway will be
permanent and irrevocable. U executed as

planned, it will spell the demise of the
unencumbered vista down the nave
intended by the original architect, James
Gamble Rogers, 1889. In 1928, Rogers,
a personal friend of the donor, John
William Sterling, 1864, indicated the
importance of this generous public space,
when he wrote thal the nave should be
"large and imposing, to give the best first
impression and the best last impression."
The obvious alternative, of course, is to
place the stairway and information desk
in the side aisle to the north, where staff
offices are now located. Upon descending
the stairs, one would be within two steps of
the ramp leading to the underground
areas. This solution, according to Uni-
versity Librarian James Tanis, 1941, is
structura!Jy feasible and was his own first
intention.


The reasons for its rejection are in-
structive. According to Tanis, the New
York firm of Edward Larrabee Barnes,
the present architects, argue that the
nave site is "more straightforward and
direct"; that to appear "logical" the
entrance must be on axis with the rooms
under the Cross Campus, and that the Area
Studies scholars who intend to use those
underground rooms have said that the
side aisle placement would make their
work area appear too "peripheral."


The wishes of these same Area Studies
professors dictated the skylight system
which will dominate the altered Cross
Campus. East Asian, Southeast Asian,
Russian and East European scholars, who
will utilize the 60,000 square feet of
faculty offices, seminar and reading rooms
and book stacks beneath the Cross
Campus, have insisted on having "natural
fight" for their study area. Fears that the
absence of direct daylight will induce
claustrophobia have apparently been
expressed by a sizable minority.


These arguments, ironically, have been
countered in an elaborate portfolio of
pictures and text prepared by the Uni-
versity itself for potential donors to the
Library scheme. The text implies that
the interior light court is now obsolete
since its "original function of providing
light and air to the stacks, seminar rooms,
departmental libraries, and other facilities
which surround it on four sides has been
rendered unnecessary by the advent of
modern lighting and air conditioning."


Sophisticated new methods of artificial
lighting, a vast improvement over the
old bulbs and bare fluorescent fixtures will
furnish illumination for the scores of '
windowless spaces, new and old, in the
book tower. Artificial light, unsupple-
mented by daylight, has also been
considered adequate both psychologically
and functionally for the proposed under-
ground Historical Manuscripts and
Yale Publications Rooms.


But a similar solution for the Area
Studies facilities has been rejected. Instead,
sixteen skylights, each eight feet wide
and twenty-six feet long, and arranged in
the surface of the Cross Campus in two
rows of eight, will provide daylight to
the new reading rooms below. Even this
daylight will be insufficient and will at
all times require supplementary light.
. Thus f.uncti?nally unnecessary, the sky-
hghts whtch wtll drastically alter the Cross
Campus appearance are the result of
a>sychological anxieties about closed
~paces. Yet elsewhere in the same library,
tmproved artificial lighting devices and air
conditioning have been thought sufficient
to render such fears negligible
and obsolete.
