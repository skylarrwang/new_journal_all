The day after the Department of History 
announced the new changes in its under-
graduate curriculum in January, the 
Yale Daily N ews carried an editorial 
congratulating the department for "a wise 
and imaginative restructuring" of the 
major, resulting in "sufficient flexibility" 
for "the most specialized or the most 
catholic of minds." Such "thoughtful, 
creative curriculum planning," the News 
continued, was a compliment to Yale 
students' "academic maturity and 
integrity." 

Â· Substantial changes in the curriculum 
of the H istory Department might be 
expected to attract the News' attention; 
History is Yale's largest department, 
with over 100 faculty members and 
affiliates, about 300 undergraduate majors, 
and for 1968-69, course offerings to the 
number of 130 terms. Yet if the News' 
attention was almost inevitably attracted, 
its praise is usually not easily won. The 
unanimous endorsement of the new pro-
gram by the department and the en-
thusiasm it evoked from the News 
suggested that both teachers and students 
considered the changes to be judicious 
and timely. 

Timely, certainly. The present program 
was barely five years old, but particularly 
within the past year it had increasingly 
become a focus of reflection and rest-
lessness. Discussions among the faculty, 
particularly the junior faculty, exhibited a 
growing discontent with the pedagogical 
implications of some of the requirements 
of the major. In May, the Student Advisory 
Committee, beaded by Professor Robin 
W. Winks, had presented to John M. Blum, 
then Chairman, a long and reasoned 
critique of the undergraduate program, 
making recommendations that were 
directed neither at the faculty's teaching 
nor at the department's offerings, but 
rather at restrictions against the students' 
fullest access to opportunities already 
available within the department. Most 
important, in the spring, Professor Henry 
A. Turner, Jr., a former Director of 
Undergraduate Studies in History, bad 
applied for and received support from the 
Moore Fund for a systematic and en-
compassing examination of the teaching 
of history in Yale College. His recom-
mendations, grounded in part on his survey 
of history programs at other American 
universities, were to become the basis of 
the reforms enacted the following fall. 

Everyone acknowledged that the chief 
barrier to reform was the departmental 
examination. How far it hampered the 
teaching of history in Yale College is only 
now becoming fully apparent. But last 
year it was apparent enough. In April, the 
Course of Study Committee voted to 
propose in the fall that departments be 
allowed to devise alternatives to the 
standard two-day, four-hours-per-day 
examination that had been required 
in Yale College since 1937. 

The examination was unsatisfactory, of 
course, not per se but because of the 
degree to which it determined the entire 
structure of the history major. Any 
history department must be concemed 
that its students' schedules show both 
specialization and diversity. But because 
Yale College required a two-day ex-
amination, the History Department was 
obliged to translate this concem into 
a requirement that each student display 
equal competence in two areas of history 
out of eight, defined geographically. This 
amounted to something like demanding 
two majors, and it committed the under-
graduate program to a geographical 
division of historical fields that was both 
confining and old-fashioned. It is true that 
the department's offerings were abundant, 
and that the eight areas, of which the 
student had to pick two, covered almost 
the entire earth. But anyone with a scintilla 
of imagination can slice 100 courses in 
more than eight ways. Thus a student who 
wanted a perfectly sensible and not very 
daring topical specialty, like in-
tellectual history or social history, or a 
completely respectable chronological one, 
like nineteenth-century Britain and 
Europe, was discouraged and sometimes 
actually prevented by the structure of 
the major from pursuing it. 

The restrictions that the examination 
thus imposed on the department's free 
utilization of its resources were a com-
paratively recent phenomenon, the result 
of the growing depth and diversity of the 
resources themselves. The 1967-68 
Programs of Study catalog took 15 pages 
to list well over 100 terms of history 
courses, somewhat fewer than a third of 
them in non-Western history. In 20 years 
the number of courses had almost doubled, 
and the proportion of non-Western courses 
to those in the traditional field had tripled. 
This expansion of the curriculum was a 
function of an impressive growth in the 
size of the staff from about 30 in 1948 to 
about 60 in 1960 and to about 100 in 
1967, a signal that the department had 
aggressively and spiritedly determined to 
make its province the entire globe and its 
business history in all its manifestations. 

Such a determination issued from a host of 
factors, chief among them a post-war 
intellectual reorientation of the entire 
nation, and closer to home, the Univer-
sity's decision in the Fifties to support area 
studies programs on an ambitious scale. 

This was the background of this fall's 
reorganization of the history curriculum, 
after the Yale College Faculty had 
approved the Course of Study Committee's 
proposal on the departmental examination 
in early November. The fundamental 
question which then faced the department 
seemed straightforward: By what ad-
ministrative machinery could the depart-
ment best employ its resources in teaching 
history to undergraduates? Like many 
simple questions, this one masked com-
plications of some magnitude. What, for 
example, is history? No history department 
worth its hire would be able to answer 
that question with one voice, but two 
propositions were self-evident, and on 
them Professor Tumer based his recom-
mendations. The first was that whatever 
else history is, it is written; and the second 
was that, as Turner's proposal declared, 
there is a "vital distinction between history 
as the events of the past and history as 
the discipline of historical inquiry." That 
distinction, he added, was one which the 
present major had failed to convey to 
many students, and one which could be 
conveyed, in his judgment, only by 
allowing (or requiring) each student to 
write an independent historical essay. 

He therefore proposed that beginning 
with the Class of 1970, the department 
require an historical essay from each 
senior. He recommended a maximum 
length of 50 pages. on the well-known 
grounds that it is easier to write 100 pages 
than a polished essay of 50 pages on the 
same subject, and in order to emphasize 
the department's conviction that, as the 
1968-69 catalogue declares, .. precision, 
revision, and conciseness are essential to 
good historical writing or, for that matter, 
to good writing of any sort." The faculty 
unanimously endorsed this proposal, and 
did so with full knowledge that it would 
mean additional work for everyone, since 
each essay would receive individual 
supervision from a member of the faculty 
in the area of the student's topic. 

Besides the historical essay, Turner 
made another proposal: that each major 
be required, during his junior year, to take 
a seminar in a subject of his choice, both 
to deepen his knowledge in his field of 
concentration and to prepare himself for 
the writing of his essay during senior year. 
This recommendation met with instant 
acceptance. By last fall there was not a 
member of the faculty who did not realize 
that the department's seminars were 
probably its soundest, most popular and 
most productive courses, thoroughly tested 
by development and growth over a num-
ber of years. Under the rubric of History 
80, History 81 and History 85, these 
seminars had increased from about seven 
or eight a year during the Fifties and early 
Sixties, to more than 20 during the aca-
demic year 1967-68. Admission bad been 
competitive, sometimes intensely so. 

Students liked them for at least two 
reasons. One was that the standards en-
forced in the seminars were professional, 
and the s<udent of the "New Yale" was 
increasingly at least sub-professional in his 
approach to his studies. Another reason 
was that the seminars were both par-
ticipatory and personalized and thus 
agreed with certain other pedagogical 
ideals of present-day undergraduates. In-
structors liked such seminars because they 
permitted teaching from one's strengths 
and research interests and because the 
students in them tended to be unusually 
hard-working and responsive. 

Obligatory rather than optional 
seminars meant that the department would 
have to provide more of them. The answer 
to this problem was at hand. The sub-
stitution of an historical essay for the 
departmental examination freed the staff 
of History 89, of whom there were 
thirteen, for new seminars. History 89 
was a mandatory reading program for 
history majors, defined not so much on its 
own terms as in terms of the examination, 
for which, inter alia, its purpose was to 
prepare seniors. Well-intentioned, well-
manned, theoretically well-cqnceived, it 
had from its origin been unpopular with 
both faculty and students because of its 
inescapable role as a "prep course for the 
comps." With the abolition of the ex-
amination and consequently of History 89, 
the department was in the enviable posi-
tion of being able to make a requirement 
which it could enforce with excellence and 
variety, one which possessed demon-
strated appeal to both instructors and 
students. The new seminars are called 
History 91, and next year there will be well 
over 30 of them. Their function, in Pro-
fessor Turner's words, will be to give 
students "a thorough grounding in the 
subject matter, while at the same time 
providing them with the skills required to 
write history," each instructor being left 
substantially free to determine the most 
appropriate ways of achieving these 
objectives in his own seminar. 

The historical essay during senior year 
and the History 91 seminar during junicx 
year are thus the core of the department's 
new program. Mutalis mutandis, the 
essay-seminar combination bad defined 
the old Intensive Major, which was 
discontinued because any distinction
