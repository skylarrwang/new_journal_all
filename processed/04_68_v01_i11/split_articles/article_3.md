Chekhov, like the weather, is what every-
one talks about and no one does anything
about. Among recent talkers is the Yale
Repertory Theatre with its production of
The Three Sisters. Although the company
did manage to present the play, it wasn't
able to exert much more constructive
influence over the script than the Weather
Bureau was able to exert over the month
of February.


Ah, Chekhovl Who is to know what to
make of this morose man who described
himself as a physician who has "also
written for the stage"? Acknowledged as
a master of minutiae and a consummate
dealer in details, Chekhov in a seemingly
casual moment can illuminate a drab life
and shed new light on the muddled efforts
we all make to Jive together.


Only Chekhov could get away with
appearing to ramble idly through the first
act of a masterpiece: the Prozorov girls
and their new friend Colonel Vershinin,
like expatriate New Yorkers ill met
in Grand Rapids, jabber mindlessly about
the streets of Moscow where Irina played
as a girl, where Olga and Masha became
women and where the Colonel (he was a
lieutenant then) fell in love. Through that
casual but compact chatter of Old Bas-
manya Street, Chekhov creates his people
and his world. He will spend the rest of
the evening giving flesh to their hopes and
disappointments, their confessions and
compromises and, of course, their de-
partures. In The Three Sisters, as in all
of his plays, the master gives the history of
people through carefully selected detail.


The long shot by way of the close-up is
the essence of his art.


In its richness and complexity, The
Three Sisters is probably Chekhov's finest
work. In it one hears the themes of all
modern playwriting, from O'Neill's obses·
sion with family history to the ·distant
rumblings of Beckett in Masha's toast:
"Here's to our empty life, the Hell
with it."


In a time when the production of
classics and established works seems to be
dominated by the thoughts of Jan Kott
and the sound of music is acid rock,
Chekhov is in danger of being forgotten;
for not even the Yale Drama School could
replace a samovar with a silver bowl of
pot. Quite to the contrary, Chekbov
au nature/ is proving a bit more durable
than most of the classics.


If in the Thirties American productions
of The Three Sisters seemed to be about
Tusenbach and his aristocrat's myopic
view of "work," and if in the Fifties, while
we were all chafing under the glare of
the Senator from Wisconsin, the play
seemed to be about Natasha, appearing
from nowhere to insinuate her nouveau
fangs into the Prozorovs, then in 1968, at
Yale at least, The Three Sisters seems to be
a play about Andrey, the intelligent,
ambitious and well-meaning man who
would not--or could not-
take a moral
stand. Clearly, The Three Sisters reaches
out of its own time and seeps into the
contemporary consciousness, illuminating
our lives and holding up to its own bright
light issues that would have seemed like
science fiction to the Prozorovs.


The Three Sisters does not offer oppor-
tunities for spectacular performances
such as Kenneth Haigh's Henry in the
recent Pirandello play. Rather it demands
the collective unfolding of a company's
skills; it calls for an ensemble effort in
which all the performances are excellent
and no seams are allowed to show. The
Yale Repertory Theatre eked out the
Pirandello on the strength of Mr. Haigh's
formidable performance. They apparently
are not ready for Chekhov. That the
production did not entirely hold together
is not because it was "long," as the local
paper would have it, but because its seams,
in the form of two of the three sisters,
were weak.


Of the three sisters, only Kathleen
Widdoes as Irina succeded in generating
excitement and the spirit of life. Rose
Arrick, who made her first appearance
with the company as Masha, was not quite
so successful. Miss Arrick created a suit-
able outline: her Masba was bitter, cynical
and full of herself. A good beginning; but
although her early scenes were interesting,
Miss Arrick was not able to meet the
role's complex demands in acts three and
four. Her performance held no surprises,
caught no one off balance and finally made
of Masha more a visitor from Peyton
Place than Chekhov's foolish, yet sympa-
thetic, crumbling lady. Jeanne Hepple .
as Olga, the third sister, the aging spinster,
managed to give a sense of desperation
and resignation, but her voice is harsh
and filled with repetitious rhythms and
patterns that make all her lines sound
alike.


The performances by the men were a
little more consistent. Baron Tusenbach
was Stacy Keach, who pranced through
the first two acts with an eagerness born of
sublime stupidity. His bewilderment at
the events of the final acts made a fine
counterpoint. Mr. Keach found a delicious
humor in his role, and his enthusiasm
in the early scenes was infectious. Barry
Morse, making his debut with the com-
pany in the role of Vershinin, also found
a gentle humor in his role. Mr. Morse
looks disarmingly like a young Bernard
Shaw, and even if he occasionally sounds
as if he were doing a James Mason imi-
tation, his command of the stage and its
language is apparent.


The best performances came in the
supporting roles. Michael Lombard's
Andrey, all frustrated intellect and
thwarted ambition, was superb. Mr.
Lombard skillfully changed Andrey from
an eager young man to a bitter middle-
aged one. Richard Jordan as Kulygin
played the fool with enough sympathy to
make it credible that, at 18, Masha might
have married him. Kulygin was less a
clown than a well-intentioned ass. It
stands as Mr. Jordan's best work by far
this season.


Paul Mann's Chebutykin was like a
great rambling bear, slowly turning from
warm and friendly to gruff and cynical.
That off-and-then-on-again member of the
company, Ron Leibman, played Solyony.
He was handsome and quite mad, if a
bit melodramatic.


Natasha was played by a student, Joan
Pape, who held her own in some heady
company. It is a rare opportunity for a
student to play a role of this size with a
company of this stature. That Miss Pape is
capable of it augurs well both for her
future and for the Dean's contention that
his students will learn best by working
side by side with the best.


The smaller roles were all played by
students who were for the most part
competent but, except in a few well-
shaped moments, obviously apprentices.
Despite the damning gaps in the acting,
there are some good things about the
production. Most important, the play's
