Monkey on a String 
The implications of a white man writing a novel about a 
black man have been argued back and forth in the past 
literary year in a dizzying sort of intellectual table-tennis. 
The problem of resolving William Styron's responsibilities 
as either pure artist or as socio-political speaker in a 
lime of racial turmoil is made more difficult by Styron's 
pretensions of writing the "confessions" of a slave in 1830. 
In Monkey on a String, Joseph Viertel undertakes 
what seems to be the same impossible task of white 
writing about black, and yet skillfully avoids the 
obviousness of Styron's mistake. Viertel's protagonist, 
Marcus Garvey Holmes, is a Northern black man 
who has "made it," i.e., has accepted the role of white 
man's Negro in contemporary American society. The 
novel is basically the chronicle of his growth from "black 
brat" in a Connecticut slum to ambassador to a newly 
emerging African nation. Against a well-documented, 
realistic background of ambassadorial politics, State 
Department society, and Crossroads Africa programs, 
Viertel guides his hero into a convincing world of white is 
right. "I'm a Negro, yet I have done anything a white 
mao can do." 

By virtue of the unique background that Viertel creates 
for Holmes and the tightly constructed plot of ex-
tenuating circumstances and tantalizing opportunities 
alered him, Viertel evokes both sympathy .for Holmes 
and a ready-made rationalization for his actions. The 
author develops Holmes' unique character circum-
llantially: his father's occupation and his mother's very 
liaht skin color signal his embrace of the Tom role within 
tbe traditional framework of a hostile white society. 
Viertel deftly defines his hero by his actions in the white 
perspective of the author, a society rife with hypocrisy, 
fear and guilt. For the most part, Viertel retains his 
artistic integrity in studying Holmes, for up until the 
last pages Holmes is very much a white man whose 
actions are not only predictable but inevitable. 

Beyond the complex interplay of events and circum-
stances which form the plot, Viertel feels compelled to 
give some psychological motivation to his hero. In doing 
this, the author exhibits his delicacy and dramatic 
understatement to their greatest effect and almost n1an-
ages to free himself from the perceptual-and 
experiential-limitations of a white man. Yet at bottom 
Viertel seems to be begging the question. He develops 
the character of Holmes as a man so singly motivated 
by virtue of his confidence in the white system that he 
represses adult analysis of his motivations. Any ob-
jective alternative to Holmes' actions are voiced by stock 
characters divorced from his internal crisis, such as his 
father, the proud Baptist minister, his sister, the Afro-
intellectual, and Proby, the Negro militant. As a black 
I felt the strongest identification with Proby, even though 
Viertel marks him with the stigma of being communist, 
army defector, and militant African nationalist. It is 
only Proby, however, who pushes Holmes to the limits of 
his role as white man's Negro. 

Ultimately, Viertel discloses that Holmes' psycho-
logical motivations are rooted in infant psychosexual 
preoccupations and childhood experiences. He master-
fully accumulates the evidence of Holmes' desire to be 
recognized and possessed by a white woman. His mother 
was a beautiful mulatto who was often mistaken for a 
white; his sister, also light-skinned, was consistently 
favored as a child; and his first childhood playmate, 
Polly, was white. Holmes' obsessive desire for a white 
woman, a symbol for which he is willing to sacrifice 
everything~ven personal success-is ironically fulfilled 
by his disastrous marriage to a neurotic white girl, Robbi. 
In the development of Holmes' relationship with 
Robbi, Viertel demonstrates tremendous powers of narra-
tive and dramatic suspense; yet the author unfortunately 
succumbs to the traditional myth of white woman as 
goddess. Holmes' disgusting, fawning Uncle Remus voice 
unconsciously establishes his position and identity with 
respect to Robbi. The sexual frustrations of their marriage 
place him at the mercy of her neuroses, and their travels 
through Africa offer experiences that corroborate the 
myth of the cold, aloof white woman secretly wor-
shipped by black men. 

This myth establishes motivations for Holmes' actions 
which in themselves reveal Viertel's second misconcep-
tion. In his struggle for success as a West Point cadet, 
as a career army officer and finally as an ambassador, 
Holmes is made to endure hardships imposed by the 
hostile or indifferent white society. Viertel implicitly 
suggests that his hero is a better man for having shaken his 
burden. The author offers a defense of Tomism in saying, 
Endure the sick white world and transcend. 

In his startling, moving conclusion Viertel fuses his 
manipulation of events and his psychological ground-
work to have Holmes suddenly and violently reject not 
only the white structure of which he is a part but all 
outward social involvement. The reader's personal 
judgment of whether Holmes ultimately succeeds or 
fails does not detract from the power and skill of 
Viertel's chronicle. As for Viertel's success, it is qualified 
by his limitations as a white author operating in a 
specific cultural background. Perhaps he is just as trapped 
as Marcus Garvey Holmes.
