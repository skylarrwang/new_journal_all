At the Resistance rally on April 3,
Staugbton Lynd urged the university
anti-war movement to get off the campus
and to develop new strategies for reaching
all the American people. One such
strategy is draft action.


Draft action is partly rooted in the
religious pacifist tradition that is recog-
nized as conscientious objection by the
Selective Service System. But the pacifist
tradition is limited to a faith that demands
a transcendent critique of human in-
stitutions. As escalation mounted in
Vietnam, new groups began in Berkeley,
Chicago, New York and Boston. They
embody a variety of ideas and strategies,
but they have two common aims: a desire
to reach everyone who is "up tight" with
the draft (regardless of religious or
political belief) and a determination to do
battle with the system which is generating
the war in Vietnam.


Traditional draft counseling offices were
passive, religiously oriented and severely
restricted in activities; the new groups
are activist, politically radical, and linked
to a wide range of social and cultural
movements. The Boston Draft Resistance
Group trains new counselors in batches
of one hundred, helps men avoid induction
through a variety of deferments, searches
out new 1-A's to talk to, holds mass dem-
onstrations, and coordinates more than
twenty community and university
projects. The Berkeley area movement
claims up to 30 draft refusers per week.


The organizers of these activities span
the entire spectrum of dissent, from
radical pacifists and Resistance members
through political organizers and black
militants to hippie drop-outs. Draft action
confronts the war on two levels: the
immediate level of saving men's Jives and
putting pressure on the government, and
the long-range level of transforming
America's institutions from machines of
concealed inequity to instruments for
democratic values. Both tasks are still
urgent; the recent possibility of nego-
tiations in Vietnam has done nothing to
Jessen the draft calls or to encourage a
clear rethinking of America's world policy.


Four weeks ago the New Haven Draft
Action Group opened its office at 241
Orange Street. It encourages new members
and plans to offer expert counseling on
draft Jaw and to organize at Yale and in
the New Haven community.
