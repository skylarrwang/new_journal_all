continued from page 2 
delicate spine comes through largely un-
damaged, and the director, Larry Arrick, 
has not inundated us with the mock 
Moscow Art Theatre gloom so common 
to Chekhov productions in this country. 
Mr. Arrick has taken the play from page 
to stage with apparent simplicity. As a 
result Chekhov is the winner, and perhaps 
that is the best thing about the Yale Three 
Sisters. For in the end, despite an uneven 
production that lacks the patina only time 
can bring to an acting company, despite 
the occasional moment that falls flat or 
the costume here or there that is out of 
place, the evening belongs to Cbekbov, 
who will always be able to make us believe 
against our intellects that although Olga, 
Masba and Irina may never get to 
Moscow, there is still hope that you and 
I will make it.
