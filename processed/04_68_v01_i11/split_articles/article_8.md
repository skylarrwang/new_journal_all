Part of every society is the constant search to 
define right from wrong, good from evil, normality 
from abnormality, etc. One mechanism whereby a society 
defines its position on various moral and legal issues is 
by promoting people to fill roles which test the issues. 
These testers are called deviants, and this adjudication 
process serves to articulate the value issues for the 
society. Once the issues have been aired, the testers may 
continue to be viewed as deviants, or under certain 
circumstances, as heroes. 

A case in point would be the recent developments on 
issues which have concerned students intensely. One 
year ago, it was highly probable that a young man who 
burned his Selective Service card in defiance of the 
draft law would have been quickly singled out and 
prosecuted. Lately, however, because entire groups of 
students congregate to defy the Selective Service System, 
and because religious and educational leaders have 
sanctioned the burning of the draft cards, the incidence 
of prosecution is extremely low. Similarly, anyone 
supporting Eugene McCarthy three months ago was 
considered a deviant, but the New Hampshire Democratic 
Primary provided a public airing of the issues. Today 
the M cCarthyites stand vindicated, and certainly as time 
goes on they are no longer considered the deviants they 
Qnce were. The deviant in society forever takes the risks, 
and gambles against the odds, while the rest of society 
acts as the censor-the Liberal vs. the Conservative 
incarnate. 

In The Wayward Puritans, Kai Erikson offers us a 
volume clearly written and highly relevant to these 
current social situations. Employing the methodologies 
of sociology and history, Erikson extrapolates from the 
early Puritan experience certain modes of behavior which 
he postulates can be treated as an example of human 
life everywhere. 

The study is based on the French sociologist Emile 
Durkheim's functional approach to society. One of the 
major postulates of this theory is that society can be 
viewed as a self-perpetuating mechanism, as an 
equilibrium-seeking entity, always tending towards 
homeostasis. Functionalists look at social behavior in 
terms of what that behavior contributes to the main-
tenance of a given society. Certain forms of behavior are 
termed eufunctional or functional if they make a 
positive contribution to society, and dysfunctional if 
they contribute negatively. 

Within this framework Erikson examines the functions 
of deviance in a society. Can deviance play a positive 
role in a society? In Eriksons words, " ... does it make 
any sense to assert that deviant forms of behavior are 
a natural or even beneficial part of social life?" Erikson 
answers yes. 

H is study is not based solely on scientific method, but 
is directed towards important scientific questions. It 
would be easy to praise or criticize the book on the basis 
of its methodological successes and limitations. On the 
one hand Erikson succeeded in .finding a community for 
study that was sufficiently isolated so that his data 
accurately reflected some of the internal dynamics of 
that society. On the other hand, the book may be criticized 
because the same isolation factor makes the society so 
unique as to make generalization impossible. 

It might be more profitable to ask for what purposes 
society designates certain behavior as deviant. Erikson 
hypothesizes that the purposes are to identify and main-
tain social boundaries. One might wonder why, after 
making this observation, he failed to discuss its moral 
implications. Erikson alludes to the moral social value by 
suggesting that labeling of behavior as deviant is a 
positive benefit; however, he does not consider the 
labeling mechanism in the open. 

If Erikson is correct in asserting that society labels an 
almost infinite variety of behavior as eccentric and 
deviant, then surely it is important to face the next 
intellectual task of questioning whether people can be 
sacrificed in their roles of deviants for the social purpose 
of testing boundaries. Are there other methods of setting 
limits in social space? Is it possible that promoting a 
group of citizens into criminality is too high a price for 
society to pay?

**Title: Couples**
**Author: John Updike**

458 pages, Affred A. Knopf 
Any restaurant or train-station bookrack has a novel or 
two about life in some small New England town where 
adultery is the chief excitement. I'm afraid that John 
Updike's new novel, Couples, 'fill soon join them, pink-
flesh-and-black-underwear cover and all. 

But the life of Updike's novel may not be confined to 
the porno shelves. The blurb on the inside flap of the cover 
gives a foretaste of what will happen if and when the 
book is taken up by college courses in American fiction. 
It reads, "The circle of acquaintances is felt as a magic 
circle, with ritual games, religious substitutions, a priest 
(Freddy Thorne), and a scapegoat (Piet Hanema)." 

Which is a strange way to advertise a book by a novelist 
whose experiments with heavy symbolism have already 
earned him a great deal of unfavorable criticism. 

The novel is, in fact, a serious attempt to deal with the 
ennui of suburban life and its opiate, adultery. Tarbox, the 
setting for this study of drained existences, is an old 
Massachusetts Bay settlement. Close enough to Boston 
to be within commuting distance, and yet far enough out 
along the shore to be a desirable "country" residence, 
it has been taken over by young professional couples 
and their playpen development houses. 

Piet Hanema, somewhat reluctantly, is their real estate 
man and builder. At one stroke he gained both his 
wife Angela and his business from his father-in-law. The 
couple's marriage is pervaded by resentment of this 
arrangement. They use their sexual relationship to fence 
with one another. Angela claims to be frigid with her 
energetic husband, who is already unsettled by confused 
guilts over the death of his parents in a car accident. 

As always, Updike is very successful in depicting the 
arrested young American m ale. With seeming ease Piet 
searches for peace of mind among the wives of the 
couples who make up his tennis-and-cocktails set. A 
variety of similar frustrations make them willing partners. 

As an epigraph Couples has a quotation from Paul 
Tillich's Future of Religions which describes the 
increasing apathy of professional people toward the 
formal processes of society. Tillich claims that this is a 
condition unfavorable to the preservation of democracy 
but favorable to the rise of religions. Updike's characters 
are seeking fulfillment of the kind that religion offers, but 
Christianity is dead for them. Nor does society offer 
them any acceptable forms of morality. In the background 
Kennedy is shot down in Dallas and Johnson becomes 
President, but these events in no way interweave with 
the lives of Tarbox. On the night of the assassination the 
couples decide that it is better to suffer together than 
alone, and their commiseration leads to just another party. 

Similarly, local politics are merely a diversion for the 
couples. When they become involved, it is because a cause 
happens to be fashionable. Their indifference and 
cynicism lead them to ignore public issues. 

But they prove to have no alternative source of 
strength in their personal worlds. Personal relationships 
provide no workable set of values. What love there is 
between these people is brittle and sour, so that each affair 
declines from the moment of its consummation. The 
attraction is the adventure, the assertion of freedom and 
the sense of plundering that each infidelity entails. But 
once the desire for these is satisfied, and it is very soon, 
the affairs degenerate into routines ruffled by petty 
resentment and conflicting demands. Experiment adds 
nothing: this is sex without conviction. 

The mutual absorption of the couples is part of their 
conspiracy to maintain a fiction of youth. While their 
children explore the darkness of the woods, caught up in 
fierce antagonisms and profound anxieties, their 
fathers play touch football and basketball. At a party 
the adults make a cumbersome and pathetic attempt to 
Twist. The scenes of their "making out" belong to the 
world of Holden Caulfield. 

Updike's writing throughout is as meticulously finished 
and self-conscious as ever. But whether by accident or 
design, it serves a fine purpose here. The adjectivally 
over-abundant descriptions are not erotic. They cover 
the love-making with a veneer of false lyricism, an 
intellectuality which discloses its hollowness. They render 
the barren tedium of a way of living that should be 
wished on nobody.
