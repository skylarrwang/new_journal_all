between Intensive and Standard Majors 
would now be irrelevant. In addition, the 
department decided to make no stipula-
tions as to the specific subject matter 
of courses offered in fulfillment of the 
required twelve terms of advanced courses 
in history. The old requirement of four 
terms in each of two out of eight fields 
had hampered students' access to the 
variety that the department could offer; 
Yale College itself had recognized the 
justice of students' distaste for specific 
requirements when it had instituted the 
new guideline system, counseling the 
student "to design his own program for 
himself"; and the emphasis that the 
seminars and the historical essay place 
on individual exertion and accomplish-
ment does not comport either theoretically 
or practically with such restrictions. The 
department therefore agreed to advise each 
student to construct a program of study 
that included both reasonable diversity 
and a field of concentration defined by 
himself in consultation with his adviser. 
This program has the advantages of 
rigor and simplicity, and it has already 
been the object of inquiries from other 
universities and other Yale departments. 
But it should be clear by now that the new 
major is grounded in the local history 
of a particular department with its own 
special goals and problems and that it 
ought to be regarded with extreme caution 
as a model for general curricular reform. 
The program goes into effect with the 
Class of 1970, and there are some stresses 
ahead. It is inevitable in a program so 
highly individualized that some students 
will experience individual disappoint-
ments, either in not being admitted to their 
first, or perhaps even to their second, 
choices of seminars or in not being as-
signed to the essay director they might 
especially want. It is inevitable also that 
some students will not take seriously the 
department's warnings about the strin-
gency of the standards to be enforced with 
respect to the historical essay, so that one 
can anticipate a larger number of degrees 
than usual awarded in November, rather 
than June, 1970. In short, though the 
News was gracious in its praise, it may 
have been premature, for there are bound 
to be imperfections in any administrative 
contrivance. It is obvious that for this new 
program to fulfill the News' expectations 
of it, what is needed is good will and hard 
work on all sides, not least from the 
students.
